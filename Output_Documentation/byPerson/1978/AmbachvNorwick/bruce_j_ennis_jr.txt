mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellants'
arguments
here
and
in
their
briefs
largely
ignore
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
new
york's
unusual
and
even
unique
statutory
scheme
and
the
narrow
and
rather
traditional
legal
theory
that
was
the
basis
for
the
unanimous
judgment
below.
many
of
the
issues
raised
by
appellants
need
not
be
resolved
in
order
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
for
example,
this
court
could
assume
as
did
the
court
below
that
new
york
might
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
preventing
some
aliens
from
teaching
some
subjects
at
some
grade
levels
and
nevertheless
conclude
as
did
the
court
below
that
this
particular
statute
is
not
necessary
to
protect
that
interest
and
in
impermissibly
under
and
over
inclusive.
the
statute
is
under
inclusive
because
it
does
not
require
citizenship
or
even
declarant
status
for
teachers
in
private
schools
who
teach
18%
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
school
population
in
new
york
state.
under
new
york
law,
private
school
teachers
are
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
here
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
i
think
not
your
honor
for
the
following
reason.
the
question
is
not
whether
new
york
would
be
constitutionally
required
to
require
teachers
and
private
schools
to
teach
the
principles
of
democracy
or
would
be
constitutionally
preventive
from
doing
so.
that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
new
york
state
legislature
has
chosen
to
require
teachers
in
private
schools
to
teach
the
principles
of
democracy
which
shows
that
the
state
has
an
interest
whether
it's
a
constitutional
interest
or
not,
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
but
it
shows
that
if
the
state
has
an
interest
in
requiring
private
school
teachers
to
teach
the
principles
of
democracy.
but
if
it
is
not
necessary
to
ensure
that
private
school
students
learn
the
principles
of
democracy
to
require
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
that's
entirely
correct
your
honor,
but
it
is
also
true
in
new
york
that
parents
have
no
choice
at
the
present
time
whether
their
private
school
students
are
taught
the
principles
of
democracy
or
not.
it
is
required
by
new
york
statute
that
private
school
students
are
taught
those
principles.
our
point
here
is
simply
that
if
citizenship
or
declarant
status
is
not
necessary
to
ensure
that
private
school
students
learn
those
principles.
it
is
not
necessary
to
ensure
that
public
school
students
learn
those
principles.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
again,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
in
this
case
that
new
york
is
required
by
the
constitution
to
have
exactly
identical
requirements
for
public
school
and
private
school
teachers.
the
point
i'm
simply
making
is
that
the
new
york
state
legislature
has
already
by
statute
required
that
the
principles
of
the
democracy
be
taught
by
private
school
teachers.
the
new
york
state
legislature
would
clearly
have
the
constitutional
authority
in
my
opinion
if
it
shows
to
do
so
to
require
that
private
schools
teachers
meet
the
same
minimum
qualifications
as
do
public
school
teachers
and
that
would
include
the
same
citizenship
or
declarant
statute
requirements.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
not
that
there
is
a
separate
and
independent
equal
protection
violation
because
of
the
different
citizenship
requirements
for
private
school
teachers
and
for
public
school
teacher.
the
point
i'm
simply
making
is
that
the
state
has
already
indicated
it
has
an
interest,
a
state
interest
in
making
sure
that
private
school
students
learn
the
principles
of
democracy.
and
the
state
apparently
believes
that
it
can
fulfill
that
interest
at
least
in
the
private
schools
without
also
requiring
citizenship
or
declarant
status
for
the
private
school
teachers.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor
that's
entirely
a
matter
of
speculation.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
or
in
the
legislative
history
of
either
of
those
statutes
that
could
properly
answer
your
question
on
that
point.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
that
entirely
apart
from
the
private
school
point,
this
statue
is
also
under
inclusive
because
under
a
regulation
issued
by
appellants,
aliens
who
are
barred
by
a
federal
statute
from
becoming
citizens
or
even
from
filing
declarations
of
intent
to
become
citizens
are
nevertheless
permitted
in
some
circumstances
to
teach
even
in
the
public
schools.
i
think
the
statute
is
over
inclusive
because
it
applies
to
any
alien
from
any
country
and
prevents
that
alien
from
teaching
any
subject
at
any
grade
level.
it
therefore
applies
to
aliens
such
as
appellees
who
are
willing
to
take
an
oath
to
support
the
state
and
federal
constitutions
and
who
have
actually
taught
the
principles
of
democracy
in
new
york's
private
schools.
it
applies
to
aliens
such
as
appellees
who
are
married
to
united
states
citizens,
who
are
the
parents
of
united
states
citizens,
who
have
resided
here
for
well
over
a
decade,
and
who
even
received
their
graduate
education
in
new
york
public
universities.
the
statute
applies
to
aliens
from
countries
whose
political
traditions
and
values
are
indistinguishable
if
not
much
the
same
as
our
own
for
example,
appellee
norwick
was
born
in
scotland
and
is
a
citizen
of
great
britain.
even
if
we
assume
that
the
state
does
have
an
interest
in
preventing
for
example
russian
citizens
from
teaching
civics.
must
it
prevent
french
citizens
from
teaching
french,
or
canadian
citizens
from
teaching
math
or
metal
work
in
order
to
protect
that
interest?
finally,
despite
appellants'
erroneous
claim
that
it
was
only
dicta,
a
reading
of
kay
versus
the
board
of
education
shows
that
the
new
york
courts
have
squarely
held
that
the
citizenship
requirement
"is
not
limited
to
elementary
and
secondary
schools
and
the
court
therefore
holds
that
bertrand
russell
is
not
qualified
to
teach
in
city
college
by
reason
of
the
provisions
of
this
section."
your
honor,
one
of
the
important
--
your
honors,
one
of
the
important
questions
in
this
case
is
the
appropriate
standard
of
review.
now
we
believe
that
even
under
a
rational
basis
standard,
this
statute
is
not
necessary
and
would
not
survive.
for
example,
it
cannot
rationally
be
supposed
that
an
alien
who
on
the
first
day
of
residence
in
this
country
files
a
declaration
of
intention
and
is
thereupon
permitted
to
teach
in
new
york
public
schools
for
five
years
will
know
more
about
this
country's
values
and
morals
share
those
values
and
morals
and
be
better
able
to
teach
them.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor,
we're
not
arguing
for
a
perfect
match
here
but
i
do
believe
that
based
on
the
factors
identified
in
our
brief
that
this
particular
statute
is
substantially
and
impermissibly
under
and
over
inclusive
not
just
that
there
is
a
small
difference
but
that
there
is
a
great
difference,
a
difference
of
constitutional
significance.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
certainly
that's
the
terminology
of
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
arguing
both
your
honor
but
let
me
turn
to
that
point
and
say
to
the
court
what
i
believe
strict
scrutiny
is
in
fact
the
appropriate
standard
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
did
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
actually
not
your
honor.
because
the
previous
alien
cases
of
this
court
including
for
example
foley
which
was
decided
on
a
rational
basis
ground
state
in
a
footnote
in
foley
in
the
majority
opinion
that
even
if
the
state
is
legislating
to
define
its
political
community,
the
statute
cannot
sweep
indiscriminately
that
it
must
make
careful
choices.
and
whether
we
choose
the
word
necessary
choices
or
over
or
under
inclusive
i
think
is
not
a
particular
appropriate.
when
we're
talking
about
aliens
who
have
historically
been
a
suspect
class
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
politically
powerless,
i
think
that
kind
of
scrutiny
by
this
court
is
warranted.
but
let
me
turn
to
the
point
of
why
i
think
it's
clear
that
strict
scrutiny
is
in
fact
required
in
this
case.
very
recently
in
nyquist
versus
mauclet,
this
court
ruled
that
statutes
which
limit
the
benefits
to
citizens
or
to
declarant
aliens
must
be
strictly
scrutinized.
now
that
was
a
5
to
4
decision
but
it
has
not
been
overruled
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
was
financial
assistance
for
higher
education,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor
and
as
i
believe
you
pointed
out
in
your
opinion
in
that
case,
well
that
was
a
lesser
interest
of
the
plaintiffs
involved
than
it
would
be
the
interest
in
this
case
which
is
a
right
to
employment
which
you
described
in
that
case
as
a
fundamental
personal
interest.
the
interest
in
foley
was
simply
an
additional
benefit,
financial
assistance
for
graduate
education
whereas
the
interest
in
this
case
is
actually
the
right
to
appointment.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
was
--
i'm
sorry,
i
was
talking
about
mauclet,
your
honor.
at
any
rate,
i
think
that
mauclet
is
indistinguishable
on
that
point
and
therefore,
unless
this
case
falls
within
the
political
community
exception
for
suggested
in
sugarman
and
first
applied
in
foley,
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
should
apply.
i
think
that
there
are
at
least
six
reasons
which
distinguish
this
case
from
foley
but
before
discussing
those
specific
reasons,
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
not
made
in
our
brief
which
i
personally
find
dispositive.
we
contend
as
the
new
york
courts
actually
held
in
(inaudible)
that
teachers
have
only
very
limited
discretionary
authority
under
subject
to
close
supervision.
but
whatever
authority
teachers
have
to
formulate
or
execute
broad
policy,
they
certainly
do
not
possess
as
much
authority
to
formulate
or
execute
policy
and
do
not
have
as
much
continuing
or
overall
impact
on
the
political
socialization
of
students
as
do
their
direct
superiors
the
local
community
school
boards
who
under
new
york
statute
have
the
authority
to
hire
and
fire
and
select
teachers
to
specify
the
curriculum,
to
select
textbooks
and
other
instructional
materials,
and
"to
generally
manage
and
operate
the
schools."
as
appellant
conceived
the
new
york
legislature
has
authorized
non-declarant
aliens
to
vote
for
and
serve
as
members
of
those
school
boards.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
new
york
at
least,
it
is
frivolous
to
argue
that
teachers
exercise
such
broad
policy
making
authority
that
they
come
within
the
political
community
exception
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--
when
the
direct
superiors
do
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well
mr.
justice
powell,
let
me
answer
that
question
this
way.
the
studies
that
are
cited
in
both
of
our
briefs
make
it
clear
that
social
scientist
do
not
yet
know
whether
the
role
model
of
the
teacher
or
the
curriculum
is
the
more
important
factor
in
political
socialization.
but
certainly
the
curriculum
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
many
students
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
perhaps
not
any,
your
honor.
but
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
it
leaves
it
unimpaired
for
the
following
reason.
the
school
boards
can
actually
select
the
teachers
which
are
going
to
be
the
role
models.
that's
the
first
point.
second,
the
school
boards
have
an
effect
on
the
political
socialization
of
children
by
deciding
what
they
are
going
to
read
and
the
instruction
materials
they
are
going
to
use
not
only
for
one
course
or
perhaps
for
one
year
as
the
teacher
might
but
throughout
their
entire
school
career.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
have
no
intention
to
take
away
that
statutory
authority
that
new
york
has
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
statutory
authority
which
permits
aliens
to
be
members
of
school
boards.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
we're
not
quarrelling
in
this
case
with
the
discretionary
judgments
of
school
boards
to
pick
teachers
on
one
or
another
ground.
we're
only
quarrelling
with
the
statutory
provision
which
says
that
no
school
board
whether
in
new
york
city
or
outside
of
new
york
city
can
select
a
teacher
for
public
school
who
is
not
a
citizen
or
declarant
alien.
so
we're
not
quarrelling
here
with
the
discretion
of
school
boards
except
for
the
statutory
provision
which
limits
their
discretion.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
your
honor
that
it
is
difficult
for
the
state
to
argue
that
teachers
are
so
close
to
the
core
of
the
political
community
that
they
must
come
within
the
political
community
exception.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
very
minimum
qualifications
but
as
the
state
points
out
in
their
reply
brief.
basically,
the
curriculum
is
set
by
the
community
school
boards
themselves
and
the
selection
of
textbooks.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
justice
powell,
i
know
of
your
experience
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--
in
the
school
board
of
virginia
and
i
certainly
not
going
to
quarrel
with
you
on
how
these
things
actually
happen.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
guess
that's
correct
too.
let
me
say
this
that
even
if
that
point
is
not
dispositive,
i
think
there
are
at
least
six
grounds
why
this
case
is
readily
distinguishable
from
foley.
first
the
majority
of
foley
expressly
reaffirmed
at
two
points
in
the
opinion,
earlier
cases
requiring
close
scrutiny
when
aliens
are
excluded
as
in
this
case
from
"license
to
professions.”
second,
"the
majority
also
stressed
that
the
office
of
the
policeman
is
in
no
sense
one
of
the
common
occupations
of
the
community.”
but
teaching
is
the
third
most
common
occupation
in
new
york
state
even
more
common
done
laborers
and
is
apparently
the
largest
category
of
public.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
court
has
never
elaborated
on
exactly
what
it
does
mean
by
common
occupations
but
that
is
certainly
an
important
point.
at
least
four
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
the
last
five
years
have
quoted
that
provision
of
truax
versus
raich
which
talk
about
common
occupations
and
that
was
relied
upon
for
example
in
griffiths
involving
lawyers
and
the
court
apparently
thought
that
lawyers
were
a
common
occupation
even
though
they
are
not
as
numerous
as
teachers.
third,
appellants
do
not
dispute
the
new
york
case
law
and
the
opinions
of
the
new
york
attorney
general
which
expressly
hold
that
teaching
is
not
a
public
office
and
that
teachers
are
employees
not
officers
and
do
not
"exercise
any
sovereign
power.”
in
that
connection,
i
think
it's
worth
noting
that
the
states
brief
in
foley
stressed
that
state
police
were
designated
public
officers
not
employees.
fourth,
the
majority
in
foley
also
stressed
that
"most
states
expressly
confine
the
employment
of
police
officers
to
citizens.”
but
even
a
generous
reading
of
exhibit
c
to
the
states
reply
brief
shows
that
over
three-fourths
of
the
states
do
not
require
citizenship
or
even
declarant
status
to
teach
in
public
schools
in
those
states.
fifth,
alien
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
would
like
to
say
two
things
about
that.
first,
it
is
of
course
entirely
speculative
why
10
states
in
the
last
few
years
have
abandoned
previous
requirements
of
citizenship
or
declarant
status.
we
don't
really
know
why.
but
to
the
extent
the
state
would
be
right
about
that
that
attorney's
general
of
those
states
concluded
after
reading
this
court's
decisions
that
citizenship
cannot
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
certainly
knowing
about
the
political
community
exception
discussed
in
sugarman
and
only
later
applied
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i've
argued
a
lot
of
cases
against
attorneys
general
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
don't
think
they
can
all
be
wrong
all
of
the
time.
and
if
the
unanimous
opinion
--
if
the
unanimous
opinion
of
all
these
attorneys
generals
is
that
this
court's
previous
decisions
do
not
bring
teachers
within
the
political
community
exception
discussed
in
sugarman.
i
think
that
itself
is
entitled
to
some
weight
in
deciding
what
the
law
in
this
country
is.
fifth,
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
fifth,
alien
attorneys
do
not
come
within
the
political
community
exception
to
strict
scrutiny
and
it
follows
a
fortiori.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
and
it
follows
that
teachers
do
not
because
lawyers
share
more
or
the
characteristics
of
police
fought
relevant
in
foley
than
do
teachers.
as
this
court
noted
in,
in
re
primus
"the
interest
of
the
states
in
regulating
lawyers
is
especially
great
since
lawyers
are
essential
to
the
primary
governmental
function
of
administering
justice
and
have
historically
been
officers
of
the
court.”
and
as
this
court
noted
in
griffiths,
like
police,
lawyers
can
invade
individual
privacy
through
issuance
of
subpoenas
and
compelled
depositions
indeed
the
court
noted
that
lawyers
can
even
"command
the
assistance
of
police."
finally,
teaching
is
not
a
governmental
monopoly.
all
of
the
alien
cases
today
in
which
this
court
has
not
applied
strict
scrutiny
or
has
ruled
that
citizenship
is
a
permissible
requirement
involved
governmental
monopolies.
you
cannot
have
private
voting
for
state
or
federal
officials
or
private
jury
trials,
or
private
state
police
but
you
can't
have
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
teaching
per
se
your
honor
is
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
simply
trying
to
suggest
a
distinction
between
all
of
the
previous
cases
and
this
one
which
is
based
on
the
function
of
the
job
regardless
of
whether
the
state
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
you
can
define
the
question
so
that
it
comes
out
in
your
favor,
but
i
do
not
know
that
it
will
help.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
don't
know
exactly
where
the
political
community
exception
established
by
this
court
is
going
to
lead
in
the
future.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
to
date
it
is
only
been
applied
by
this
court
to
cases
involving
pure
governmental
monopolies
and
i
think
that's
an
appropriate
place
to
draw
the
line
and
not
to
extend
it
further
than
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
court
should
focused
on
the
actual
function
involved.
of
course,
we
could
have
private
security
police
but
the
function
of
teaching
is
not
a
governmental
monopoly.
in
fact
this
court
ruled
in
the
rodriguez
case
that
teaching
is
not
only
not
a
governmental
monopoly
but
is
not
even
a
fundamental
right.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
given
to
a
public
education.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
critical
point
here
is
not
whether
the
state
has
chosen
to
make
its
regulations
applicable
to
both
public
and
private
schools.
it
could
make
the
application
applicable
to
private
schools.
the
point
is
that
the
function
of
teaching
has
never
been
thought
in
this
country
to
be
a
function
that
can
be
reserved
only
to
the
public
sector
and
can
be
performed
only
by
the
private
sector.
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
pierce
versus
society
of
sisters
and
others
recognized
that
there
is
a
private
right
to
teach
and
to
learn
and
that
it
is
not
a
governmental
monopoly.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
do
not
know
that
your
honor.
all
i
know
on
that
point
is
that
18%
of
the
students
and
elementary
secondary
schools
are
in
private
schools.
i
do
not
know
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
your
honor
but
i
think
it
does
raise
a
point
that
i
begin
with
and
that
is
new
york
statutory
schemes
are
rather
unique
scheme
including
the
statute
which
permits
aliens
to
serve
on
school
boards
and
i
think
the
decision
of
this
court
need
not
be
any
broader
than
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
and
would
not
have
to
apply
necessarily
to
the
teaching
profession
in
other
states.
i
would
like
simply
to
make
one
other
point.appellants
have
stated
under
oath
that
they
are
--
appellees
have
stated
under
oath
that
they
are
willing
to
take
an
oath
to
support
the
state
and
federal
constitutions.
now
if
what
we're
concerned
about
is
not
functional
reality
about
actual
ties
to
this
country
based
on
period
of
residence,
paying
taxes
marriage
to
u.s.
citizens.
if
what
we're
concerned
about
is
a
piece
of
paper,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
oath
is
a
more
specific
and
also
represents
a
more
present
commitment
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
under
new
york
statutory
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
under
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
the
reasons
why
a
particular
permanent
resident
alien
decides
not
at
a
point
in
time
to
apply
for
citizenship
are
entirely
immaterial
and
irrelevant.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
this
your
honor,
the
declaration
of
intention
is
merely
a
declaration
that
at
some
point
in
the
future,
the
declarant
intends
to
become
a
citizen.
the
actual
decoration
intention
says
nothing
in
it
at
all
not
whether
at
the
present
time
the
declarant
agrees
with
either
state
or
federal
constitutional
principles.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
decide
which
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
as
i
said
there
is
nothing
of
that
kind.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
i
can
say
this
in
response
to
your
question.
i
am
authorize
to
represent
to
the
court
as
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
nothing
in
the
record
but
there
is
in
our
brief
a
representation
to
the
court
that
both
appellees
would
immediately
petition
for
citizenship
and
become
united
states
citizens
if
they
did
not
have
to
renounce
the
land
of
their
birth
in
order
to
do
that.
now
the
particular
reasons
why
they
do
not
want
to
make
that
enunciation
are
not
in
the
record.
i
could
suggest
some
for
this
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
they
may
for
example
wish
to
preserve
the
rather
considerable
benefits
of
dual
citizenship
for
their
children.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well
then
i
will
not
pursue
that
point
further
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
from
finland
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well
your
honor
that
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
does
raise
the
due
process
argument
in
our
brief
which
we
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
in
detail
but
this
court
has
suggested
in
all
of
its
previous
alien
cases
that
it
has
expressly
left
open
a
question
of
whether
or
not
alienage
might
be
a
permissible
consideration
for
state
in
the
course
of
making
an
individualize
determination
about
a
job
applicant's
fitness
rather
making
a
wholesale
band
or
class
y
judgment
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
kind
of
inquiry
would
necessarily
be
precluded
by
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
i
will
not
discuss
the
due
process
arguments
or
academic
freedom
or
supremacy
clause
arguments
because
i
think
they
are
covered
adequately
in
our
brief.
thank
you.
