ms.
judith
a.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
presented
on
this
appeal
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
new
york
to
stop
qualifying
permanent
public
school
teachers
in
terms
of
citizenship
or
application
for
citizenship.
this
new
york
requirement
is
statutory.
it
is
codified
in
education
law
section
3001
(3).
it
operates
only
with
respect
to
elementary
and
public
school
teachers
and
it
asked
for
applications
for
citizenship
only
from
immigrant
aliens
who
have
the
legal
capacity
to
accept
or
reject
the
request.
other
provisions
of
what
appellants
believed
is
a
finally
home
state
program
permit
aliens
to
receive
temporary
certificates
in
certain
circumstances.
for
example,
if
an
alien
is
going
to
federal
disabilities
and
for
that
reason
cannot
acquire
citizenship,
he
can
receive
a
temporary
certificate
during
the
duration
of
those
disabilities
up
for
up
to
five
years.
if,
as
another
example,
an
alien
is
an
exchange
teacher
teaching
in
new
york
public
schools
as
an
example
of
his
own
national
culture,
he
also
obtains
a
temporary
certificate
for
up
to
two
years.
the
undisputed
facts
of
this
case
placed
the
appellees
at
the
core
of
the
statutory
requirement
for
citizenship
or
application
for
citizenship.
mrs.
norwick
has
been
a
permanent
resident
alien
in
the
united
states
for
14
years.
mrs.
dachinger
has
been
a
permanent
resident
alien
in
the
united
states
for
13
years.
during
the
entirety
of
that
period
and
by
force
of
their
legal
status,
they
had
the
capacity
to
acquire
citizenship.
both
of
these
individuals,
both
appellees
and
there
is
no
class
action
order
in
this
case.
both
appellees
sought
under
state
law
what
are
called
n
through
9
certificates,
the
certificates
that
--
pardon
me,
n
through
6
certificates.
the
certificates
that
permitted
teacher
to
teach
every,
each
and
every
grade
from
nursery
through
sixth
grade
and
in
the
circumstances
where
the
classroom
teacher
is
responsible
for
teaching
all
of
the
subject
matter
within
those
grades.
this
law
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor
with
the
caveat
in
the
record
which
i
should
perhaps
call
to
your
attention
and
that
is,
in
addition
to
the
appropriate
citizenship
requirements,
there
are
other
grounds
for
obtaining
provisional
as
distinguished
from
permanent
certificates.
mrs.
norwick
at
the
outset
of
the
case
was
denied,
not
the
outset
of
this
case,
pardon
me.
the
outset
of
her
application
to
the
state
authorities
was
denied
even
a
temporary
certificate
--
pardon
me,
a
permanent
certificate
because
she
had
not
completed
the
educational
requirements
for
that
certificate
namely
a
master's
degree,
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
cured
during
its
pendency
below
because
she
did
in
fact
at
the
master's
certificate.
so
she
would
be
qualified
under
state
law
except
for
the
failure
to
comply
with
education
law
3001
(3).
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
if
we
have
accepted
that
this
is
true
but
if
the
implication
of
your
question
is
that
in
accepting
that
statement,
the
offer
of
proof
which
is
set
forth
at
page
303
of
the
appendix
following
was
inappropriate
then
we
would
dispute
that.
appellants
contend
that
section
3001
(3)
must
be
sustained
under
the
equal
protection
clause
regardless
of
whether
the
statute
is
subjected
to
relax
or
to
strict
scrutiny.
the
statute
serves
the
state's
substantial
purpose
in
training
citizens
for
--
pardon
me,
in
training
pupils
for
their
responsibilities
as
citizens.
it
does
so
by
the
most
effective
and
least
drastic
means
available.
it
includes
those
who
are
willing
to
accept
the
responsibilities
they
must
impart,
namely,
individual
participation
and
democratic
decision-making
and
it
excludes
only
those
individuals
who
have
refused
to
participate
and
who
have
by
that
very
choice
placed
themselves
at
odds
with
the
instructional
purpose
that
the
statute
carries
out.
appellees
do
not
refute
the
proposition
that
public
education
in
fact
trains
pupils
for
citizenship.
they
also
do
not
refute
the
additional
proposition
that
public
education
through
this
training
has
been
a
force
for
social
cohesion
in
the
united
states,
forging
as
it
were,
one
nation
out
of
the
various
immigrants
who
settled
this
country
and
who
continued
to
come
here
today.
indeed,
we
do
not
think
that
appellees
could
successfully
refute
that
proposition
and
faces
this
court's
off
repeated
statements
that
the
principal
purpose
if
not
the
overriding
purpose
of
public
education
is
in
fact
training
for
citizenship.
given
this
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
well,
not
exactly
your
honor.
appellees
point
out
as
an
example
of
inconsistency
with
the
statutory
program
here
involved
that
in
new
york
city,
and
in
new
york
city
only,
aliens
have
been
entitled
to
vote
in
so-called
community
school
board
elections
and
to
seat
as
members
of
those
community
school
boards.
there
are
essentially
32
of
those
school
boards.
this
entire
program
was
first
enacted
in
1969
and
is
an
educational
experiment
which
is
as
we
showed
in
appendix,
in
exhibit
a
of
our
reply
brief;
again,
before
the
legislature
in
terms
of
consideration
of
the
validity
or
success
of
the
experiment.
now,
in
voting
in
that
kind
of
an
election
and
on
seating
on
a
school
board,
the
alien
who
votes
or
seats
does
nothing
inconsistent
with
this
statutory
program
because
3001
is
the
overriding
or
supervening
state
statute
which
classifies
all
elementary
and
public
school
teachers
in
new
york
state
and
with
respect
to
which
that
alien
member
of
the
school
board
can
do
nothing.
he
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
change
or
affect
the
role
model
example
of
the
teacher
in
the
classroom
as
member
of
that
board.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
in
fact
the
choices
constitutionally
compelled.
the
fact
that
new
york
views
as
this
court
has
viewed,
public
education
as
the
agency
or
primary
agency
through
which
citizenship
is
developed
does
not
mean
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
private
schools
do
or
should
serve
the
same
interest.
in
fact,
private
schools
are
acknowledged
to
be
in
having
opinions
of
this
court
been
acknowledged
to
serve
quite
different
interest
largely
religious
interests
and
they
operate
in
the
context
where
those
interests
are
become
paramount
to
other
interests
it
serves.
indeed,
for
example
in
new
york
city,
we
have
private
schools
that
operate
along
the
lines
of
national
interest.

gordon
well
i
think
that's
to
put
aside
the
example
of
hunter
your
honor
because
that's
a
public
school.
but
in
terms
of
dalton
or
brearley
or
the
other
private
schools
in
new
york,
new
york
has
left
the
state

so

only
64,000

those

attend
schools

the
type
that

the
rest
attend

--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
that's
true
your
honor.
we
do
not
limit
the
qualifications
of
private
school
teachers
whether
for
religious
schools
or
for
other
private
school
for
other
types
of
private
schools
to
citizens
or
applicants
for
citizenship.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
think
the
response
must
be
frank
in
the
following
way,
your
honor.
it
is
public
education
that
has
been
accorded,
the
principal
responsibility
of
training
for
citizenship.
public
education
in
new
york
is
a
matter
of
state
constitutional
prerogative
and
protection.
private
school
is
not.
but
of
course,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
kind
of
curriculum
and
the
kind
of
instructions
in
that
--
in
those
private
schools.
and
the
state
does
by
statute
which
we
cite
in
our
opening
brief
require
that
the
instruction
in
those
schools
be
substantially
equivalent.
i
call
to
your
attention,
it
does
not
require
it
to
be
the
same
and
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
statutory
plan
that
the
quality
of
instruction
for
the
purpose
of
training
for
citizenship
is
the
same.
the
curriculum
requirements,
the
basic
curriculum
requirements,
the
12
common
branches
in
elementary
school
and
some
additional
courses
and
secondary
school
are
generally
required
under
the
substantial
equivalent
formula
in
both
public
and
private
schools.
courses
in
history
are
included
in
both
public
and
private
schools.
however,
in
terms
of
curriculum
the
state
does
speak
differently
to
its
own
public
schools.
for
example,
it
requires
in
public
schools
but
not
private
schools
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
frankly,
your
honor,
no
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
states
predominant
interest
for
public
education
is
in
fact
training
for
citizenship.
i
think
as
decisions
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
because
there
is
a
fundamental
interest
in
no
--
for
the
state
in
seeing
that
certain
standards
of
educational
standards
are
met.
the
children
who
go
through
a
course
should
be
able
to
read
and
write.
but
that
doesn't
say
that
the
agency
that
has
looked
to
for
this
purpose
is
predominantly
the
private
school.
it
is
in
fact
the
public
school
and
has
the
most
significantly
to
the
extent
that
the
religious
preferences
of
parents
might
be
impeded
by
the
same
identical
regulation
of
private
schools
then
of
course
that
would
seem
to
me
that
the
state
has
acknowledged
that
and
has
said
that,
“no,
we
will
stop
shoot
of
that.
we
will
let
the
parent
who
chooses
a
different
kind
of
education
for
his
child
have
the
full
benefit
of
the
instruction
that
goes
along
with
it
and
the
states
says
that
that
is
fine.
only
minimum
curriculum
standard
should
be
met.”
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor
that
brings
us
to
the
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
we
would
apply
the
rational
basis
test
as
sustain
the
statute
that
way
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
whether
or
not
we
would
apply
strict
scrutiny.
the
force
of
my
argument
here
today
is
largely
directed
to
strict
scrutiny
because
of
course
if
the
statute
survives
that
test,
it
must
perforce
survive
the
rational
basis
test
and
accordingly,
i
directed
my
answers
in
that
vein.
but
equally
your
honor,
we
have
taken
the
position
in
our
briefs
which
is
by
no
means
is
true
and
that
is
that
the
appropriate
test
is
one
of
reasonable
relation
and
that
is
because
training
for
citizenship
as
it
has
been
an
expressed
as
the
responsibility
of
the
public
schools
is
an
important
governmental
interest,
a
proposition
which
appellees
don't
dispute
or
refute,
at
least
successfully
as
i
read
their
papers.
and
indeed
the
relationship
between
the
teacher
as
the
individual
who
is
present
in
the
classroom
who
is
the
model
and
example
for
the
behavior
or
his
students
ties
him
closely
and
reasonably
with
the
execution
of
that
governmental
purpose.
and
on
those
two
statements
we
think,
your
honor,
frankly
that
the
statute
not
only
survives
reasonable
basis
examination
but
also
strict
scrutiny
examination.
given
the
posture
of
the
case,
as
we
perceived
it
framed
by
the
arguments
offered
by
appellees
that
is
that
they
do
effectively
concede
your
honor.
that
training
for
citizenship
is
the
primary
mission
of
the
public
schools.
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
or
the
sole
question
that
remains
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
the
selection
of
the
positive
rather
than
the
negative
example
as
that
section
3001
(3)
provides
is
in
fact
reasonably
or
necessary
related
to
the
instructional
purpose
that
the
statute
serves.
and
i
think
it
is
important
in
this
context
to
examine
for
a
moment
what
the
teaching
and
learning
process
is
about.
teachers
do
not
merely
teach
by
recitation
from
a
text
if
they
ever
did
so
and
students
do
not
learn
or
wrote
studies
which
again
appellees
do
not
seriously
imposed
speak
to
the
point
that
teachers
transmit
attitudes
and
values
as
well
as
information
by
their
own
example.
that
pupils
under
their
control
in
jurisdiction
copy
and
emulate
those
attitudes
and
those
the
very
attitude
that
is
transmitted
to
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
citizen
has
the
capacity
to
participate
in
democratic
decision-making.
that
is
the
attitude
and
value
that
is
sought
to
be
transmitted.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
he
can
vote.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
think
that
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
i
don't
think
based
on
skafte
versus
rorex
that
that
would
be
likely
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
some
states
have
historically
but
not
for
a
very
long
time
in
my
understanding.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
it's
interesting
forth,
your
honor.
i
think
if
we
had
such
a
requirement,
it
would
probably
be
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
because
after
all
i
think
the
concepts
embodied
there
include
the
right
to
remain
silent
as
well
as
the
right
to
express
oneself.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that's
right
and
one
of
--
and
the
regard
for
the
assumption
of
those
kinds
of
public
duties
is
the
kind
of
attitude
and
value
that
is
sought
to
be
imparted
and
when
we
suggest
that
the
value
is
democratic
decision-making
and
also
regard
for
public
duty,
we
do
not
exclude
bringing
up
children
to
assume
the
responsibilities
of
policeman,
legislators
and
judges.
that
is
exactly
what
the
force
of
public
education
is.
i
think
as
i've
in
attempting
to
point
out
that
it
must
be
accepted
and
it
has
been
accepted
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court
particularly
wisconsin
versus
yoder
most
recently.
that
in
fact,
teachers
do
import
principles
by
their
own
example
by
these
instructions
from
their
example
of
values
and
attitudes.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
find
that
appellees
even
if
they
acted
in
the
utmost
good
faith
could
be
the
kind
of
example
that
is
consistent
with
the
statute
because
essentially
even
if
they
said
that
they
would
select
out
those
attitudes
that
they
fought
would
be
positive
reinforcements
of
the
citizenship
training
they
are
attempting
to
provide
they
could
not
effectively
do
so
because
no
individual
can
consciously
select
those
attitudes
and
values
which
they
will
convey.
teachers
convey
the
body
of
their
attitudes
all
of
the
time
and
all
of
the
courses
that
they
teach.
thank
you,
i
will
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
only
have
possibly
one
sentence
further
your
honor.
and
that
is,
that
it
is
completely
immaterial
to
this
classifying
plan
where
the
alien
comes
from
whether
he
comes
from
cambodia
or
whether
he
comes
from
finland
or
great
britain
because
so
long
as
he
has
the
capacity
to
choose
citizenship
and
refuses
to
do
so,
he
manifests
the
negative
example
that
the
statute
seeks
to
avoid.
as
to
the
rest
of
arguments
made
by
the
appellees,
we
think
that
they
are
appropriately
answered
in
our
reply
brief.
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
is
there
a
characteristic
that
affect?
there
is
a
characteristic
that
affects
permanent
resident
aliens
who
refused
to
acquire
citizenship
that
affects
their
capacity
to
teach
effectively
in
terms
of
public
education
because
they
have
eschewed
by
that
choice
to
wit
the
choice
not
to
acquire
citizenship
the
very
example
of
democratic
participation
that
they
are
trying
to,
excuse
me,
trying
to
advance
through
the
students
in
terms
of
the
balance
of
the
statutory
probe.
the
statutory
and
regulatory
program
that
portion
which
we
give
certificates
to
certain
temporary
aliens
who
are
under
disabilities
they
have
a
characteristic
or
the
absence
of
the
characteristics
which
allows
the
affair
in
inclusion
because
they
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
choose
american
citizenship
while
the
are
under
disabilities,
they
do
not
present
the
manifestly
negative
example
that
the
permanent
resident
who
do
does
have
that
legal
capacity
presents.

the
capacity
to
participate
in
democratic
decision-making.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
it
requires
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct
because
all
teachers
are
examples
and
in
that
way
communicate
values
and
attitudes
but
perhaps
more
significantly
your
honor,
because
in
new
york
as
indeed
in
every
other
state
of
which
i
am
familiar
at
least,
the
curriculum
for
teachers
for
example
in
nursery
through
sixth
grade
includes
all
subject
matters.
the
curriculum
for
teachers
from
seventh
through
twelfth
grades
where
there
is
an
academic
departmentalization
naturally
has
that
academic
subject
matter.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
because
we
don't
offer
printing
in
nursery
through
sixth
grades.
but
to
the
extent
that
you
have
a
high
school
situation
where
there
is
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
elementary
school,
no
sir,
we
don't
teach
printing
and
all
teachers
and
elementary
school
teach
all
subject
matter.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
you
mean
the
high
school
performing
arts?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
but
we
just
merely
talking
about
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
the
example
you
gave
me
your
honor
was
nursery
through
sixth
grade
and
that's
how
we
excluded
the
printing
example.
in
secondary
schools
where
education
is
departmentalized,
naturally
the
teacher
teaches
in
his
subject
matter
but
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
which
are
not
departmentalized?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor
in
new
york
secondary
schools
may
or
may
not
be
departmentalized.
where
they
are
departmentalized,
naturally
the
teacher
teaches
his
particular
course.
however,
every
teacher
even
in
secondary
school,
even
the
printing
teacher
can
be
required
by
state
law
to
teach
on
any
given
day
of
the
week,
civics,
language,
science,
and
so
on.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
i
don't
think
mop
the
floor
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that's
exactly
so.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
thank
you.
