chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
ambach
against
norwick.
mrs.
gordon,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
gordon,
why
do
you
think
you
need
to
assert
the
idea
that
private
schools
do
not
have
as
part
of
their
mission
the
training
for
citizenship.
you
don't
have
to
defend
the
statute
of
new
york
on
the
ground
that
it's
perfect
or
that
it's
perfectly
consistent.
people
would
have
the
private
school
who
wants
private
schools
just
as
we
have
religious
schools.
but
as
justice
stevens
suggested
there
are
certain
minimum
requirements
that
are
common
to
all
of
those?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
no
constitutional
requirements
that
state
statutes
have
to
be
internally
consistent,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ennis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
there
a
difference,
we
do
not
permit,
the
constitution
does
not
permit
teaching
religious
subjects
in
the
public
schools
but
it
fully
protects
the
right
to
teach
religious
subjects
in
private
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
seems
to
me
it
somewhat
dissolves
the
point
your
making.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
parents
have
a
choice
about
sending
their
children.
like
the
private
schools,
they
have
no
choice
about
sending
children
to
the
public
school
with
them
under
compulsory
attendance
laws.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
have
read
the
argument
for
a
perfectly
tailored
statute
now,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
always
easy
to
take
any
statute
in
any
area
under
the
scrutiny
of
litigated
case,
think
about
ways
that
it
could
be
made
more
merely
ideal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
also
higher
education,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
graduate
indeed,
graduate
education.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
haven't
reverse
i
think
in
mauclet
and
foley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
take
away
the
discretion
which
all
of
new
york
has
given
to
school
boards
and
not
to
engage
aliens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
citizens
of
the
u.s.s.r.
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
are
you
here?
if
you're
not
trying
to
take
away
the
statutory
authority
as
the
three-judge
court
did.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
talking
of
the
statutory
authority
who
picked
the
school
teachers
through
a
chain
of
command.
they
don't
pick
them
directly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
commons
has
been
used
in
these
decisions
in
terms
of
the
court,
in
terms
of
the
head
count?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
first
statute
does
just
that
as
mr.
justice
stevens
suggest
it
applies
only
to
the
governmental
monopoly
or
the
public
schools
of
the
limited
category,
public
primary
and
not
higher
education?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
doesn't
change
order
the
fact
that
it's
a
governmental
monopoly
to
teach
public
schools,
does
it?
the
fact
that
there's
no
enforceable
right
to
have
a
public
school
if
that's
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
suppose
in
deciding
the
case
we
might
just
as
well
assume
that
were
from
thailand,
let's
say
cambodia
and
u.s.s.r.
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
or
north
vietnam
or
vietnam
just
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
ennis.
do
you
have
anything
further
mrs.
gordon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
a
rather
simple
answer
into
the
question
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
shallow,
i
wonder
that
you
can
navigate
in
response
to
these
some
of
these
questions.
mainly
that
as
a
category,
as
a
class,
teachers
who
are
aliens
teaching
in
primary
schools
and
secondary
schools
are
category
of
people
who
reject
american
citizenship
and
announced
that
they
prefer
citizenship
in
some
other
country.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
certainly
relates
to
the
role
model
if
it
doesn't
affect
the
substance
of
the
teaching.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
powell
has
two
opinions
which
he
will
announce.
