if
a
teacher
fulfills
your
requirement,
the
teacher
could
also
be
a
policeman,
isn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
it
possible
that
new
york
may
have
felt
it
was
confirmed
with
conflicting
claims
with
respect
to
private
schools.
that
is
there
are
the
desire
for
autonomy
and
let
them
run
themselves
but
at
the
same
time
they
have
to
fulfill
some
of
the
functions
of
public
schools
and
so
they
chose
to
go
just
halfway
with
private
schools
prescribed
the
curriculum
but
not
right
heard
on
whom
i
teach?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
to
you
in
my
question
was
that
new
york
could
with
equal
constitutional
validity
decide
to
stop
short
with
private
schools
of
its
going
as
far
as
there
were
public
schools
in
saying
that
with
public
schools
we
are
required
both
teaching
democratic
citizenship
and
citizen
or
declarant
aliens
status
for
teachers.
but
with
private
schools,
it
will
simply
require
the
curriculum
content
and
let
the
private
schools
choose
the
teachers
themselves.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
an
equally
rational
inference
that
the
state
perhaps
felt
that
private
schools
would
not
be
quite
a
sure
of
fulfilling
that
interest
but
nonetheless
in
the
interest
of
preserving
autonomy
of
the
private
schools
shows
not
to
force
them
the
way
they
chose
to
force
the
public
schools?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
agree
it's
speculative.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
private
security
police?
i
mean,
obviously,
they're
not
state
official
but
nonetheless
they
prefer
the
same
functions
as
police,
isn't
that
kind
of
analogous
what
justice
stevens
is
talking
about?
it
is
somewhat
analogous,
your
honor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
say
this
your
honor
