justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
buckley
you
said
he
remains
--
he's
a
public
figure
for
a
narrow
range
of
issues.
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
a
person
who's
convicted
of
burglary
or
armored
car
robbery
in
1958
is
a
necessarily
a
public
figure
if
he's
accused
of
doing
the
same
thing
in
1979?
he's
never
been
heard
of
since,
the
only
thing
is
he's
accused
of
robbing
another
armored
truck
in
1979.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
although
he
might
be
with
respect
to
his
--
the
1958
episode.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
he
remains
a
public
figure
if
he
were
accused
of
being
a
soviet
agent
today?
he
would
still
be
a
public
figure?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
your
statement
awhile
ago
indicated
that
yes
he
would
be
a
public
figure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he's
never
been
heard
of
since.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
buckley,
would
you
say
he
is
a
public
figure
if
he
hadn't
been
convicted
for
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
i'm
accused
of
a
crime
and
for
some
kind
of
pretrial
or
during
trial
conduct,
i
am
convicted
of
contempt,
criminal
contempt.
but
i
haven't
been
convicted
of
any
other
crime,
and
then
the
newspaper
makes
some
comments
about
me
that
are
libelous
about
--
they
refer
to
me
as
the
one
who
committed
the
offense
for
which
i
am
on
trial
and
i'm
acquitted.
am
i
a
public
figure
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
i'm
--
is
it
just
because
i'm
convicted
for
contempt
is
that
enough
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
my
case,
in
my
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
he
is
convicted
of
contempt,
but
he's
acquitted
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
on
trial.
this
is,
i'm
charged
with
a
crime
of
safe
cracking,
whatever,
and
then
in
pretrial
proceedings
or
during
trial
i'm
convicted
of
contempt,
criminal
contempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
--
right
then
and
there
become
a
public
figure
or
was
i
already
just
because
i
was
accused?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
criminal
contempt
that
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
anything
they
might
say
about
my
guilt
for
safe
cracking
is
subject
to
the
public
figure
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
about
the
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
in
this
case
are
you
a
public
figure
for
anything
else
except
just
commenting
about
your
defying
a
grand
jury
subpoena?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
--
about
accusing
of
being
a
spy?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
what
they
might
believe
he
was
lying
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
anything
was
untrue
does
it
or
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
the
jury
can
disbelieve
and
disregard
his
affidavit
doesn't
mean
they
have
to
conclude
or
that
he
absolutely
knew
or
suspected
that
something
was
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
say
the
man
says
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
say
the
man
says
the
mental
element
could
be
satisfied
if
there
are
obvious
reasons
to
doubt
the
veracity
of
the
informant
or
the
accuracy
of
his
report.
now,
what
--
how
did
you,
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
you
how
did
you
satisfy
that
burden
of
proof.
what
obvious
reasons
were
there
for
the
defendant
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
his
information
objectively?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
at
least
there
was
jury
question
about
that?
