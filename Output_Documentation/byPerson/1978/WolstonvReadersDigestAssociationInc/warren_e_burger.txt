chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
wolston
against
reader's
digest.
we'll
wait
another
minute
or
so,
counsel,
while
your
audience
is
reduced.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
mr.
dickstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view,
is
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
public
figure
invariably
a
fact
issue
for
a
jury?
or
where
would
you
put
it
in
the
range
since
you
seem
to
suggest
some
special
rules
about
first
amendment
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock
mr.
dickstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dickstein
you
are
going
to
rest
at
this
point
and
reserve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
buckley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
isn't
the
only
thing
--
the
only
definition
or
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
year
was
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
what
if
he's
acquitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
you
mean
if
no
one
ever
heard
about
a
person
they
are
still
a
public
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
mean
why
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
his
mother
and
father
know
about
him.
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
complied
with
the
subpoena,
he
might
get
a
lot
more
publicity
than
if
he
refused
to
comply,
isn't
that
a
possibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
use
the
phrase
invite
defamatory
comments.
who
invites
defamatory
comments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
he
is
an
american
citizen,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
if
you
were
to
say
that
it's
an
american
citizen
who
is
asked
to
help
in
an
inquiry
into
foreign
espionage
refuses
to
assist
the
united
states
government,
then
i
can
understand
your
argument
that
he
has
at
least,
if
invited
is
not
the
right
word,
he
has
--
he
must
take
into
account
that
that
will
attract
a
lot
of
attention.
that
i
can
understand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
a
bit,
i
don't
have
the
timeframe
in
mind
but
in
the
middle
50's,
was
there
a
great
deal
of
controversy,
public
controversy
over
the
methods
being
used
to
investigate
soviet
espionage
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
borderline
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
kind
of
controversy
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
criticism
of
the
fbi
for
example,
under
the
cia?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
wasn't
that
broad,
in
the
setting
of
that
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
particular
case
was
not
a
public
controversy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
what
if
having
been
convicted
either
by
government
employee
going
home
from
work
and
resist
arrest
or
mr.
justice
white's
hypothetical
case
and
first
there's
a
conviction
for
a
contempt
or
whatever.
you
say
that
automatically
makes
him
a
public
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now
on
appeal
it's
reversed,
that
is
he
is
a
nonpublic
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
you're
going
to
penalize
him
for
taking
an
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
we
were
dealing
with
something
near
to
your
case
what
criminal
conduct
you've
described.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
certainly
can't
be
in
and
out
as
a
public
figure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
might
be
under
gertz,
what
might
be
negligence
for
a
news
magazine
a
weekly
news
magazine
might
not
be
negligence,
culpable
negligence
for
a
reporter
of
a
daily
newspaper
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
none
of
you
writing
a
history
it
strings
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we've
detained
you
unduly
long,
mr.
buckley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dickstein,
do
you
have
something
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
mr.
dickstein
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
suppose
that
a
witness
subpoenaed
in
these
same
circumstances
instead
of
just
refusing
to
appear
and
taking
all
the
consequences
of
a
contempt
citation
and
so
forth,
decided
to
go
to
one
of
the
caribbean
islands
or
south
american
countries
and
then
there
would
be
a
good
many
newspaper
accounts,
assumed
on
newspaper
accounts
that
he
had
fled
the
country.
and
then
perhaps
when
extradition
proceedings
were
started
to
get
him
back,
he
moved
to
some
south
american
country
that
has
no
extradition
treaty
with
the
united
states,
and
you
have
another
series
of
stories.
you
think
that
might
at
some
stage
bring
him
into
the
public
figure
category?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
