justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
buckley,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
spent
a
good
deal
of
your
time
defending
an
issue
that's
not
before
us,
as
i
understand
it.
you
don't
have
to
defend
the
position
that
any
one
convicted
of
any
crime
at
any
time
becomes
a
public
figure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
your
brief
and
as
i
understood
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
this
man
became
a
public
figure
in
the
opinion
of
those
courts
only
because
he
was
convicted
of
contempt
in
the
context
of
the
great
furor
in
this
country
that
existed
at
that
time
with
respect
to
communist
espionage.
now
why
don't
you
confine
your
position
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
dickstein,
he's
a
confirmed
liar
as
a
--
as
in
all
agents
are
confirmed
liars
are
they,
all
spies?
i
don't
understand
how
--
i
don't
really
understand
your
theory
about
why
that
should've
put
him
on
notice
that
a
statement
after
he'd
acknowledged
his
status
as
a
spy
would
necessarily
be
suspect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
none
of
those
things
would
put
the
author
unnoticed
that
maybe
this
statement
was
false?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
you
would
considered
he
was
totally
impeached
and
he
just
remove
all
his
testimony
from
the
record,
you
still
have
some
affirmative
burden
of
showing
the
knowledge
of
falsity.
i'm
trying
to
figure
how
you've
discharged
your
affirmative
burden.
maybe
you
can
eliminate
his
affidavit,
let's
strike
it
from
the
record.
what
have
you
got
left?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
maybe
they
won't
put
him
on
the
witness
stand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh
i
see.
