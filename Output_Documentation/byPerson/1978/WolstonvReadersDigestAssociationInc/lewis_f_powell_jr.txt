justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
buckley,
your
analogy
to
mounting
a
rostrum
prompts
me
to
ask
this
question.
sort
of
absurd
to
think
about
anybody
getting
on
a
rostrum
to
argue
against
complying
with
the
subpoena,
you
just
--
that
isn't
the
kind
of
public
debate
one
gets
into
when
he
gets
a
legal
process
served
on
him.
and
i
noticed
the
language
in
gertz
describing
the
public
figure
emphasized
as
being
drawn
into
a
public
controversy,
and
in
the
last
sentence
he
assumes
special
prominence
in
the
resolution
of
public
question.
now
what
is
the
public
controversy
or
the
public
question
that
his
man
had
prominence
in?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
something
that
could
be
resolved
by
the
public?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
was
the
controversy?
everybody
is
against
soviet
espionage.
there
aren't
pros
and
cons
about
that
are
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
isn't
it
supposedly
a
controversy
over
a
debatable
issue
on
which
people
in
the
public
might
disagree.
otherwise,
what's
the
purpose
of
this
whole
area
of
free
speech?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
was
the
public
controversy?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
matters
of
public
controversy
over
whether
the
investigation
was
being
conducted
properly?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
what
did
he
had
to
do
with
that
controversy?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
ironic,
you
know,
to
think
of
someone
trying
to
conceal
his
activities
as
a
spy
being
a
public
figure.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that's
why
i
did
not
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
buckley
--
if
you
really
know
all
about
this
person
then
you'd
know
he
really
belonged
in
the
public
domain.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
buckley
let
me
just
ask
one
question.
i
realized
your
opponent
is
pretty
much
abandoned
the
argument,
but
on
the
question
of
the
time
gap
between
when
the
conduct
occurred
and
when
the
book
was
written.do
you
think
it's
appropriate
to
have
the
same
standard
of
care
for
the
writer
who
has
to
meet
a
deadline
as
it
is
for
a
historian?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
historian
should
equally
have
the
same
latitude
to
be
really
be
on
direct
notice
of
falsehood
before
he
has
to
be
careful
about
what
he
says
about
someone.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
would
that
serve
the
public's
need
to
know
or
would
it
serve
the
public's
need
to
know
to
say
“well
if
you're
going
to
write
a
history,
be
careful.”
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
he
had
four
years
to
write
this
book,
didn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
maybe
he
wasn't
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
maybe
they
were
totally
--
they've
got
a
good
defense
there.
it's
just
not
the
question
of
the
standard
of
the
author.
does
it
really
seem
reasonable
to
say
that
a
historian
should
have
the
same
latitude
when
he
has
plenty
of
time
to
research
and
presumably
writes
something
that
has
a
stamp
of
careful
research
on
as
opposed
to
the
reporter
who
has
to
meet
a
deadline
to
get
in
before
4:30
or
whatever
the
time
the
story
has
to
be
filed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
this
wasn't
a
recent
activity.
