mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
gertz
this
court
stated
that
public
figures
are
persons
whose
actions
invite
attention
and
comment
in
the
context
of
a
public
controversy.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor
there
are
other
definitions.
for
example
there
are
some
individuals
who
have
attained
a
degree
of
prominence
in
society
generally
who
may
be
public
figures
merely
by
virtue
of
their
status.
but
there
are
other
individuals
who
have
engaged
in
conduct
which
invites
if
not
compels
public
attention
and
comment
in
a
context
of
a
public
controversy
and
therefore
become
public
figures
by
that
virtue
of
that
voluntary
conduct.
in
this
case,
wolston's
conduct
fit
that
description
precisely.
he
failed
to
comply
with
a
subpoena
issued
by
a
grand
jury
investigating
soviet
espionage.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
in
1958.
that
conduct
occurred
in
a
midst
of
a
public
controversy
over
soviet
espionage
and
that
conduct
in
fact
invited
and
resulted
in
attention
and
comment.
now
the
larger
controversy
--is
that
--
mr.
buckley,
would
that
be
true
of
any
criminal
defendant
then
that
the
press
is
free
to
libel
or
defame
him
in
the
subject
only
to
liability
under
the
public
figure
standards?
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
think
that
is
generally
the
case
that
a
person
who
engages
in
criminal
conduct
will
result
in
being
a
public
figure
at
least
for
a
limited
range
of
issues
relating
to
his
conviction.
in
this
case
however
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
your
honor,
if
he's
acquitted
then
it
poses
a
more
difficult
question.
of
course
in
this
case,
the
citation
for
contempt
resulted
in
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
charge.
if
a
person
is
however
acquitted,
then
there
will
still
remain
the
question
whether
he
engaged
in
voluntary
conduct
which
invited
attention
and
comment.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
he
would
not
be
a
public
figure
for
the
purposes
of
comment
for
example
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
right.
he
would
not
be
for
purposes
of
a
statement
that
he
was
a
soviet
agent
as
in
this
case.
he
might
not
be
for
some
unrelated
criminal
conduct.
he
certainly
would
be
for
the
criminal
conduct
for
which
he
was
convicted.
and
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
i
think
in
this
case,
of
course,
one
need
not
reach
that
result.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
if
the
statement
was
to
the
effect
that
he
was
in
the
50's
and
remains
today,
i
would
submit
that
he
would
be
a
public
figure
for
those
purposes
because
the
controversy
is
an
ongoing
one.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well,
of
course
again
in
this
case
were
limited
to
his
--
it's
limited
to
historical
comments
on
what
he
was
in
the
1950's.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
no
idea.
i
would
posit,
it's
in
the
hundreds.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
think
they
would
all
be
public
figures
for
the
purposes
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
if
one
looks
at
the
rationale
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
certainly
after
their
conviction
they
are,
i
would
submit,
a
public
figure
for
the
purposes
of
comments
on
their
criminal
conduct
in
which
they
engaged.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
no
because
of
the
nature
of
criminal
conduct
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
even
if
they
never
reach
the
newspaper.
and
the
reason
is
this.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
public?
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
first
of
all
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
right.
first
of
all,
it
requires
conduct
committed
in
the
midst
of
a
public
controversy.
now
when
someone
engages
in
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
right.
and
the
controversy
revolves
around
the
conduct
for
which
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
he
pleaded
guilty,
correct.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
by
the
guilty
plea
he
has
confessed
that
he
engaged
in
voluntary
conduct
that
was
criminal.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
for
the
following
reasons
that
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
of
course
we
say
to
begin
with
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
--
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
but
he
say
the
police
were
aware
of
his
actions
because
that
resulted
in
his
arrest
and
eventually
in
his
conviction.
let
me
say
that
in
this
case,
we're
not
--
it's
not
dealing
with
a
totally
obscured
figure
because
as
a
result
of
wolston's
conviction
for
contempt
in
1958,
he
received
at
that
time
a
fair
degree
of
publicity
and
at
least
15
newspapers
published
in
two
cities
at
that
time
in
a
book
written
by
boris
morros
in
1959,
and
in
an
fbi
report
published
in
1960.
all
of
which
discussed
his
failure
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
his
guilty
plea
to
contempt
all
show
the
notoriety
which
wolston
gained
for
himself
by
his
unlawful
conduct.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
yes,
i
would
say
so.
for
this
reason
that
wolston
became
an
activist
for
the
purpose
of
insuring
that
he
did
not
appear
before
that
grand
jury
on
july
1,
1958.
initially
of
course
he
received
a
subpoena.
that's
how
you'll
basis
for
a
complaint
on
his
part
of
course
because
as
this
court
has
held
the
law
and
the
grand
jury
as
its
embodiment
is
entitled
to
every
man's
evidence.
but
that
did
not
compel
wolston
to
do
what
he
in
fact
did.
he
had
two
lawful
alternatives
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
or
to
move
to
quash
the
subpoena
if
he
thought
it
to
be
unreasonable,
oppressive
or
in
violation
of
any
constitutional
or
statutory
right.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
but
his
conduct
could
not
be
said
to
be
as
it
can
fairly
be
here
to
have
been
on
such
a
nature
as
to
have
invited
defamatory
comments
as
to
have
opened
the
door
to
speculation
on
the
basis
for
his
refusal
to
comply
with
the
subpoena.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
think
when
one
engages
in
conduct
which
inevitably
attracts
by
its
very
nature,
public
comment
and
attention,
and
especially
when
that
conduct
is
criminal
conduct
that
it
invites
people
to
discuss
his
actions
particularly
where
that
conduct
is
committed
in
the
midst
of
a
federal
investigation
into
soviet
espionage.
it
sparks
the
public
debate,
it
arouses
public's
interests.
it
runs
the
risk
of
closer
public
scrutiny
and
of
course
even
more
than
if
he
had
mounted
a
rostrum,
it
constitutes
on
his
part
a
relinquishment
of
some
measure
of
his
interest
in
the
protection
of
his
own
good
name.
it
opens
the
door
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well,
i
did
say
that
no
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
would
say
your
observation
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
would
say
your
honor's
observation
is
true
in
every
case
of
a
public
figure
including
someone
who
runs
for
office.
in
those
senses
he
invite
lies,
but
he
is
nonetheless
a
public
figure.
so
here
in
this
case,
wolston
engaged
in
conduct
that
bears
all
the
earmarks
of
public
figure
status
under
gertz.
conduct
which
attracted
public
attention
in
the
midst
of
a
public
controversy
which
ran
the
risk
of
closer
public
scrutiny,
which
constituted
a
relinquishment
of
some
measure
of
his
interest
in
protecting
his
own
good
name,
and
which
invariably
opened
the
door
to
speculation
on
the
reasons
for
his
refusal
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
including
the
possible
and
related
inference
that
he
was
in
fact
a
spy.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
he
is.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
certainly
a
person
who
engages
in
criminal
conduct
to
refuse
to
bear
a
subpoena,
invites
comment
on
his
actions.
that's
invariable
consequence
of
his
refusal
to
appear,
and
it
certainly
was
in
this
case.
after
all,
if
one
pauses
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
context
in
which
this
conduct
occurred,
the
fbi
had
been
engaged
in
a
ten-year
investigation
of
soviet
espionage.
the
soble's
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
the
culmination
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
it
became
public
in
january
1957
when
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
no,
it's
before
the
fact.
when
as
a
result
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
before
the
fact,
because
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
the
investigation
had
been
going
on
for
ten
years.
it
culminated
in
the
arrest
of
the
soble's
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
it
was
a
controversy
that
was
going
on
because
there
was
an
investigation.
it
first
came
to
the
public
for
in
early
1957.
but
at
that
time
it
built
up
even
increasing
momentum.
the
soble's,
wolston's
aunt
and
uncle
were
indicted
for
espionage,
entered
pleas
of
guilty
and
thereafter
cooperated
with
the
federal
grand
jury.
in
the
ensuing
months,
a
series
of
additional
indictments
were
handed
down
against
others
involved
in
the
spy
ring.
the
stage
had
thus
been
set
for
wolston.
the
subject
of
soviet
espionage
by
the
middle
of
1958
had
achieved
a
prominence
in
the
public's
mind,
after
all
it
did
concern
national
security.
his
failure
to
appear
was
the
climax
of
an
unsuccessful
15-month
effort
by
the
grand
jury
to
obtain
his
testimony.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
now,
for
this
reason
that
we're
not
relying
here
only
on
the
fact
that
this
conduct
attained
publicity,
but
on
the
fact
that
the
conduct
by
its
nature
invariably
attracted,
invited
and
compelled
comment
and
attention.
after
all
there
is
the
clear
language
of
gertz
that
public
figures
are
persons
who
invite
attention
and
comment
in
public
controversies.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well,
let's
examine
that.
i
think
the
position
taken
by
petitioner
here
is
that
to
be
a
public
figure
it
is
not
enough
to
have
engaged
in
conduct
attracting
by
its
very
nature
attention
and
comments
in
a
controversy,
but
to
have
desired
the
publicity
as
well.
that
is
i
believe
the
nub
of
his
theory.
let's
look
at
it
from
two
standpoints.
the
first
is
from
a
jurisprudential
standpoint.
the
determination
of
what
a
public
figure's
personal
or
subjective
motive
is,
i
would
submit,
a
very
dicey
task
at
best.
a
person
who
engages
in
criminal
conduct
to
disrupt
a
government
ceremony
may
have
a
whole
panoply
of
whole
motives,
saddling
the
press
with
proving
what
the
causative
or
primary
motive
was
in
engaging
that
conduct,
i
would
submit
does
not
promote
the
constitutional
values
involved.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
right.
but
i
think
here,
i
don't
think
that
important
distinctions
in
the
measure
of
constitutional
protection
of
free
speech
should
turn
on
so
supra
in
enterprise.
but
let
me
take
it
to
a
different
stage
which
is,
let's
look
at
it
in
terms
of
the
two
values
or
two
interests
accommodated
by
the
public
figure
doctrine.
now
what
this
theory
would
require
is
dividing
a
class
of
libel
plaintiffs.
all
of
whom
took
conduct
which
invited
and
attracted
public
attention
and
controversy
and
comment
in
a
controversy
into
two
subclasses
which
would
depend
on
the
method
by
which
they
use
to
affect
the
controversy
or
to
attain
the
notoriety.
so
for
example,
the
division
would
be
between
voluntary
conduct
which
purposely
seeks
notoriety,
and
voluntary
conduct
which
inevitably
by
its
nature
attracts
notoriety.
between
open
advocacy
of
a
particular
results
and
conduct
which
inevitably
affects
or
has
that
same
result.
so
wolston
here
says
in
his
brief
that
he
will
be
a
public
figure
if
he
had
mounted
a
rostrum
and
argued
against
his
grand
jury
appearance.
but
that
he
shouldn't
be
if
he
merely
engaged
in
a
contempt
precluding
his
grand
jury
appearance.
the
first
interest
accommodated
by
the
public
figure
doctrine
is
the
public's
need
to
know.
how
is
that
need
to
know
any
less
in
one
case
than
in
the
other?
the
citizen
in
becoming
informed
about
soviet
espionage
has
as
much
a
need
to
know
about
someone
such
as
wolston
who
commits
a
contemptuous
act
precluding
the
grand
jury
from
obtaining
his
testimony
as
it
would
about
wolston
if
he
merely
advocated
against
it.
indeed
the
need
in
this
case
would
be
greater
because
he
didn't
just
talk
about
it,
he
did
something
about
it.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
here
in
both
instances
by
the
same
degree,
the
conduct
engaged
in
by
the
public
actor,
either
in
mounting
a
rostrum
or
in
engaging
in
conduct
which
criminal
conduct
which
attracts
publicity
is
the
same.
but
it's
the
public's
need
to
know
is
the
same
as
no
reason
to
draw
a
line
between
the
two.
in
fact
the
need
to
know
is
greater
in
the
case
where
one
speaks
about
pure
conduct
that
in
the
case
when
one
speaks
about
pure
advocacy.
the
other
interest
to
be
accommodated
under
the
public
figure
standard
is
the
reputational
interests
of
the
public
figure,
which
are
regarded
as
less
than
the
wholly
private
person
because
he
has
committed
conduct
which
has
in
created
and
enhanced
likelihood
of
defamatory
statements
being
made
about
him
because
he
has
invited
indeed
the
very
types
of
comments
about
which
he
now
complains.
now,
surely
that's
true
whether
wolston
mounts
a
rostrum
to
argue
against
his
grand
jury
appearance
as
it
would
be
if
he
in
fact
took
contemptuous
conduct
precluding
his
grand
jury
appearance.
in
both
instances
to
the
same
degree,
the
conduct
creates
an
enhanced
likelihood
of
defamatory
statements.
it
runs
a
risk
of
closer
public
scrutiny,
and
it
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
the
public
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
the
public
controversy
was
the
controversy
over
soviet
espionage
and
the
actions
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
term
necessarily
means
that
it's
limited
to
some
matter
that
is
about
to
be
put
to
a
referendum.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
i
think
that
under
that
statement
it
qualifies
as
well,
because
in
all
instances,
particularly
in
this
instance
where
we
had
a
ten-year
investigation
by
the
fbi
into
soviet
espionage,
actions
by
the
grand
jury
spanning
well
over
a
year
and
a
half.
there
was
a
controversy
over
the
subject
of
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
the
controversy
was
over
the
propriety
of
the
actions
by
the
public
officials
running
the
investigation,
by
the
grand
jury
conducting
it.
it
was
in
every
sense
something
that
related
to
the
matters
of
governance.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
because
he
became
an
activist
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
that
the
grand
jury
did
not
obtain
his
testimony
regarding
soviet
espionage
and
did
so
by
his
own
voluntary
conduct.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
certainly
so.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
let
me
say
to
begin
with.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that
certainly
could
be
that
let
me
say
to
begin
with
though
that
anytime
the
government
takes
actions
particularly
in
the
context
of
an
investigation
of
soviet
espionage,
there
is
a
matter
pertaining
to
the
affairs
of
governance
about
which
the
public
a
right
to
be
informed.
now
let's
--
in
firestone
this
court
focused
on
meaning
of
the
phrase
public
controversy
and
the
court
held
that
a
matrimonial
dispute
is
not
a
public
controversy
under
the
reasoning
that
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
right.
the
dissolution
of
a
marriage
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
right,
that's
correct.
and
the
court's
rationale
was
that
at
heart,
this
was
a
dispute
between
of
course
two
spouses
that
had
only
been
brought
into
the
court
because
of
the
requirements
of
the
state.
and
that
dispute
between
two
spouses
in
a
marriage
is
a
private
domestic
affair
about
--
that
does
not
qualify
as
a
public
controversy.
now
in
this
case,
there
is
a
clear
difference.
the
commission
of
criminal
conduct
by
wolston,
if
there
was
not
already
a
controversy
ongoing,
created
a
new
one
that
is
a
controversy
involving
himself
on
one
side
and
the
federal
government
on
the
other.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
there
were
15
newspapers
that
were
published
at
the
time.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
me,
personally?
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
he
never
came
into
my
office
though.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
the
time
that
the
deposition
was
taken,
so
i
came
to
this
case
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
suppose
if
i
had
been
a
better
student
and
had
read
more
widely
in
the
area,
i'd
be
able
to
give
your
honor
a
response
that
i
did
know
about
him.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
let
me
put
it
in
this
way.
well,
obviously
first
of
all
there
were
ten
individuals
who
were
identified
as
soviet
agents
as
a
result
of
this
fbi
investigation.
many
of
them
were
well
known,
jack
soble
for
one,
his
wife
another,
the
sterns
and
on
that
down
the
list.
this
was
no
secret
investigation,
it
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
--
i
don't
think
it's
ironic
at
all,
it's
because
espionage
inevitably
invites
and
attracts
publicity
that
it
must
be
done
covertly.
if
one
is
going
to
steal
the
plans
to
the
hydrogen
bomb
and
how
they
go
about
it
by
walking
in,
in
broad
daylight
into
the
pentagon
and
looking
for
the
plans.
but
nevertheless,
it's
because
of
the
recognition
that
if
someone
knew
what
you
were
up
to,
the
press
would
indeed
be
interested
in
it
by
its
very
nature.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
yes,
i
have.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
don't
think
in
each
and
every
case
someone
who
is
a
public
figure
under
privacy
law
is
so
the
purposes
of
libel
law
as
well.
but
certainly
in
the
context
of
this
case
i
would
submit
that
the
result
should
be
the
same,
because
someone
like
author
barron
in
writing
a
book
on
the
kgb
and
in
discussing
the
more
recent
disclosures
concerning
the
activities
of
that
organization,
has
a
compelling
need
to
refer
to
the
history
of
the
controversy
to
the
background
and
how
these
present
events
evolve.
in
fact
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
follows
in
each
and
every
case.
but
if
one
looks
at
the
earmarks
of
public
figure
status
identified
in
the
gertz
opinion.
but
i
think
that
in
this
case
it
follows
at
least
in
respect
to
someone
who
engages
in
a
criminal
contempt.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
think
he
has,
because
the
conduct
by
its
very
nature
attracts
attention
and
notoriety,
criminal
conduct,
i
think
always
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well,
but
these
are
the
earmarks
of
public
figure
status
under
gertz.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
he
creates
the
enhanced
possibility
by
criminal
conduct
of
the
very
types
of
comments
about
which
he
now
complains.
and
just
as
much
if
he
had
ran
for
office
to
have
an
affect
upon
the
governmental
process,
the
failure
to
appear
before
a
federal
grand
jury
in
response
to
a
subpoena
has
a
direct
effect,
which
more
then
if
he
had
mounted
a
rostrum
upon
the
governmental
process.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
wouldn't
say
that
in
order
to
qualify
for
a
public
figure
one
has
to
almost
be
a
public
official.
but
in
this
context
i
think
it
was
sufficient.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well,
it
would
depend
on
whether
he
in
fact
engaged
in
criminal
conduct.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
what's
this
case
is
all
about,
the
commission
of
criminal
conduct.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
and
later
on
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
might
well
depend
on
an
examination
of
the
--
of
what
happened
thereafter.
if
eventually
he
was
convicted
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
if
the
public
controversy
was
still
alive,
i
think
he
would
still
be
a
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
or
if
the
comment
pertained
to
with
a
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
then
he's
a
public
figure
for
those
purposes,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
think
it's
impossible
to
write
a
book
such
as
kgb
without
referring
to
the
history
of
the
activities
of
that
agency.
and
certainly
i
think
it
would
not
make
sense
in
that
regard
to
have
on
every
page
the
constitutional
standard
varying
back
and
forth
depending
on
the
time
period
in
which
the
conduct
or
the
comment
refers
to.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
he's
a
public
figure
as
i
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
he's
still
a
public
figure
for
the
limited
range
of
issues
relating
to
his
earlier
conduct.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that
is.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
think
that
would
create
a
much
more
difficult
question,
because
i'm
not
saying
he
would
necessarily
would
not
be
because
the
criminal
law
imposes
standards
that
are
different
from
those
and
posed
for
trimming
whether
someone
is
a
public
figure.
for
example,
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
specific
criminal
intent.
one
might
engage
of
course
in
conduct
that
is
not
criminal
and
still
be
a
public
figure,
and
if
he
could
not
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
if
you're
acquitted
of
the
charge
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
in
this
case,
it
certainly
is
because
the
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
in
your
case,
the
lawyer
eventually
was
not
convicted
for
contempt.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
you
are
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
no,
after
you
are
convicted
to
be
sure,
you
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i'm
not
arguing
that
here.
i'm
not
saying
that
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
but
i'm
saying
that
if
there
was
any
--
if
you
became
a
public
figure
as
result
of
your
conviction
for
contempt
then
for
purposes
of
a
limited
range
of
comments
relating
to
that
contempt,
you
will
be
a
public
figure,
not
necessarily
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
what
the
comment
was
in
effect
about,
because
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
it
opened
the
door
to
speculation,
i
would
submit
for
a
range
of
issues
relating
to
possible
reasons
why
he
did
not
comply
with
the
subpoena.
one
possible
inference
being
of
course
that
he
was
a
soviet
spy.
and
this
conduct
occurred
in
the
context
of
a
major
controversy
over
soviet
espionage.
let
me
say
there's
no
contention
here
that
wolston
was
the
prime
actor
in
the
entire
controversy,
but
he
was
at
least
a
supporting
actor
who
was
starring
in
his
own
subplot
with
a
script
he
largely
authored
by
his
own
contempt.
and
therefore
became
part
of
the
larger
drama.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
if
one
engages
in
criminal
conduct,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
not
necessarily.
certainly
in
the
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
one
can
engage
in
conduct
that
is
not
criminal
and
yet
be
a
public
figure.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
always
the
question
is
what
was
the
underlying
voluntary
conduct?
it
may
have
been
criminal
or
noncriminal.
if
it
was
criminal
i
would
submit
that's
a
strong
indication
that
that
conduct,
criminal
conduct
by
its
nature
attracts
public
attention
and
comment.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
your
honor,
i
certainly
am
just
trying
to
be
helpful
to
the
court
--
members
of
the
court
who
wanted
to
broaden
the
question
under
examination.
but
that
is
the
whole
point
of
this
is
that
this
was
not
routine
crime
as
all
the
hypotheticals
put
involve
but
rather
real
major
controversy
involving
a
10-year
fbi
investigation,
a
grand
jury
that
handed
down
a
series
of
indictments
against
others
for
espionage.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
think
so
especially
with
respect
to
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
think
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all
the
public's
need
to
know
is
the
same.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
in
--
nothing
in
a
few
are
pure
history.
kgb
is
not
pure
history.
some
of
it
involves
the
more
recent
activities
of
the
kgb.
should
one
delay
publication
of
this
hot
news
in
a
sense
about
the
more
recent
activities
because
one
has
to
spend
more
time
investigating
under
different
standard
of
liability,
the
history
of
the
controversy?
i
don't
think
it
makes
sense
because
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
he
did,
indeed
explained
about
four
years
in
writing
the
book
and
his
reliance
was
placed
upon
an
official
report
of
the
fbi,
the
accuracy
of
which
had
never
been
called
into
question
until
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well
in
the
present
context,
there
were
more
recent
activities
in
the
kgb
itself.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
no
this
wasn't,
but
in
order
to
illuminate,
give
meaning,
give
context
to
the
discussion
of
the
more
recent
activities
it's
necessary
to
get
history.
if
one
applies
in
the
theory
that
you
should
take
longer
to
write
the
background
that
will
delay
the
publication
of
that
--
those
matters
that
are
more
current.
and
therefore,
i
think
the
policy
defeats
itself
because
the
two
are
really
related.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
like
the
where
the
standard
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
well,
that
i
think
is
not
relevant
as
to
the
standard
of
liability.
but
his
actual
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
don't
--
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that
the
definition
of
actual
malice
changes
because
the
publisher
is
a
news
reporter
versus
an
historian.
the
standard
is
the
same.
was
the
comment
published
with
a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
probably
falsity
as
this
court
stated
in
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
i
don't
really
think
so
because
the
policy
underlying
the
actual
malice
standard
is
getting
at
the
calculated
falsehood.
i
don't
say
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
no
that's
not
so.
first
of
all
in
the
--
with
respect
to
the
statement
that
wolston
had
been
identified
as
a
soviet
agent
as
a
result
of
an
official
investigation.
it
was
undisputed
that
barron
relied
upon
an
official
report
of
the
fbi
which
so
identified
him,
so
there
was
no
evidence
here
of
knowledge
of
falsity
or
reckless
disregard.
now,
in
addition
to
that
barron
submitted
an
affidavit
and
was
deposed
and
in
that
context
swore
that
he
believed
the
truth
of
his
publication.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgments
if
the
court
can
grant
summary
judgment.
if
there
are
no
contrary
inferences
that
can
fairly
be
drawn
from
the
evidence.
if
there's
no
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
if
it
stood
alone,
but
it
didn't
stand
alone
here.
one
had
the
fbi
report
which
itself
in
fact
identified
wolston
as
a
soviet
agent.
i
think
that
in
the
reply
brief,
petitioner
candidly
admits
that
his
position
is
that
a
plaintiff
in
a
libel
case
has
no
obligation
to
introduce
evidence
contradicting
the
sworn
assertions
of
the
publisher
as
to
his
belief
in
the
truth
of
his
publication.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
but
much
more
was
involved
--
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
because
there
were
no
contrary
inferences
which
could
be
fairly
drawn
from
the
evidence
involved
in
this
case.
how
can
reliance
upon
an
official
report
of
the
fbi
unequivocally,
categorically
identifying
someone
as
a
soviet
agent
constitute
proof
in
any
sense
of
actual
malice.
were
it
so,
then
historians
and
newscasters
would
report
the
official
findings
of
such
agencies
at
their
peril
because
under
petitioner's
view,
there
must
always
be
a
costly
trial
irrespective
of
the
evidence.
and
that
he's
under
no
obligation
of
his
view
to
present
evidence
to
the
contrary
putting
an
issue
as
he
must,
a
genuine
issue
if
material
fact.
mr.
john
j.
buckley,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
