justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dickstein,
could
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
counsel
in
the
case
preceding,
then
the
source
of
law
is
district
of
columbia
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
basic
right
rise
out
of
the
district
of
columbia
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
the
rule
on
summary
judgment
that
where
a
party
defendant
makes
an
affidavit
that
he's
not
only
got
--
you
have
right
to
depose
him
but
that
the
district
court
has
to
resolve
issues
against
him
if
they
are
triable
issues
of
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what's
the
basis
for
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
basis
for
any
different
rule
on
a
libel
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
seek
to
the
fullest
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
nonetheless
chose
to
believe
his
statement
without
a
trial
of
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
was
an
instance
of
his
injecting
himself
into
a
controversy
intentionally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it
sounds
like
that's
the
metro
media
plurality
test,
if
it
whatever
attracts
public
attention,
make
somebody
a
public
figure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
would've
meant
a
voluntary,
i
mean
that
they
deliberately
invite
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
dicey
task
to
determine
actual
malice
under
the
new
york
times
standard
too,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
precisely
that
same
dichotomy
is
involved
in
his
libel
defendants
with
20
newspapers
who
all
published
the
same
story.
the
libel
plaintiff
is
equally
damaged
by
all
20
of
them,
but
if
it's
published
with
actual
malice
there
can
be
recovery.
if
it's
published
without
actual
malice,
there
can't
be.
and
yet
the
good
name
is
equally
tarnished
regardless
of
the
motive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
buckley,
am
i
right
in
understanding
mr.
dickstein
and
is
he
right
in
saying,
if
i
am
right
in
understanding
him
to
say
so,
that
the
district
court
simply
accepted
at
its
face
value
the
affidavit
of
an
interested
defendant
that
he
intended
no
malice
and
granted
judgment
on
that
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
no
reason
why
the
district
court
has
to
--
should
believe
that
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
an
interested
party's
testimony
can
always
be
disbelieved
by
a
jury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
i
would
have
thought
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
burden
of
proof
--
the
burden
is
on
the
party
moving
for
summary
judgment
and
the
credibility
of
a
--
interested
witnesses
for
the
jury,
do
you
dispute
either
of
those
propositions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
why
should
your
party
grant
on
summary
judgment
here?
