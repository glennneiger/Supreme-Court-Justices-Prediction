you
say
you
filed
a
reply
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
seem
to
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
read
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
mr.
buckley?
justice
potter
stewart
i
asked
you
because
i'd
not
read
it
until
the
lunch
hour,
i
had
not
seen
it.
as
you
know
in
that
reply
brief
the
distinction
is
made
between
the
loss
of
privacy
and
the
public
figure.
it
may
well
be
that
a
person
who
commits
a
criminal
offense
or
allegedly
commits
one
or
somebody
who
resists
his
subpoena,
loses
any
claim
he
may
have
to
privacy
with
respect
to
publicity
of
that
fact,
publicity
of
emanating
from
his
conduct.
but
does
it
follow,
and
that
loss
of
publicity
serves
to
satisfy
at
least
one
of
the
interests
that
you
described
to
us?
does
it
necessarily
follow
or
should
it
that
loss
of
privacy
is
equivalent
to
becoming
a
public
figure?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
--
and
to
be
sure,
when
the
petitioner
resisted
the
subpoena
and
didn't
appear,
there
could've
been
legitimate
reporting
of
that
fact,
and
he
would've
had
no
right
to
hold
anybody
liable
for
reporting
it
because
he'd
lost
his
privacy
pro
tanto.
but
does
it
follow,
does
it
necessarily
follow
at
all
that
are,
or
the
two
at
all
equivalent
that
he
is
there
by
a
public
figure?
justice
potter
stewart
and
one
can
understand
if
a
person
becomes
a
candidate
for
governor
or
mayor
or
president
or
indeed
if
he's
elected
to
any
one
of
those
offices
he
is
a
public
figure
and
he
does
invite
adverse
criticism,
some
of
which
will
be
false
probably.
and
he
knows
it's
going
to
come
and
that's
a
true
public
figure,
but
if
somebody
simply
is
arrested
for
robbery
or
having
contempt
for
disobedience
of
a
subpoena,
he
loses
his
privacy
but
it
certainly
doesn't
follow
he'd
becomes
a
public
figure
and
can
reasonably
expect
or
have
or
be
said
to
have
invited
adverse
and
perhaps
false
defamatory
comment.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you're
reporting
a
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
running
for
office
is
quite
a
different
thing,
isn't
it
or
holding
public
office?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
they're
basically
equivalent
as
so
far
as
the
law
and
the
constitution
goes,
resisting
a
subpoena
and
running
for
the
presidency?
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
ralph
nader
is
a
public
figure
but
doesn't
hold
any
public
office,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
it's
just
an
ordinary
citizen,
secretary,
clerk
and
the
government
is
accosted
on
the
street
by
a
policeman
who
wants
to
arrest
him
and
has
no
reason.
and
some
opinions
of
some
courts
have
said
that
citizen
may
resist
an
unlawful
arrest,
and
that
person
does
resist
the
arrest
and
puts
his
name
in
the
paper
and
on
the
evening
television
news.
that
make
him
a
public
figure?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
just
what
i've
said
to
you.
justice
potter
stewart
no
court
has
yet
decided
whether
he
is
engaged
in
criminal
conduct
here.
