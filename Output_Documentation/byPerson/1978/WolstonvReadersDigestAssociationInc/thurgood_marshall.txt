how
many
people
are
usually
arrested
in
new
york
city
in
any
one
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
they
all
be
public
figures?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
for
the
record,
i
can't
remember
the
name
of
one
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
they
become
a
public
figure
nobody
ever
heard
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
never
reached
the
newspapers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they've
never
--
yes
if
they
never
reached
the
newspapers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they've
been
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean
by
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
public,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
a
public
controversy
is
that
when
a
man
is
charged
with
a
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
this
--
my
case,
my
hypothetical
is
no
controversy
if
he
pleaded
guilty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there's
no
--
it
takes
controversy
out
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
becomes
a
public
figure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
nobody
ever
heard
of
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
--
i
mean
firestone
didn't
even
go
that
far,
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
say
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
merely
mean
he
invites
discussion,
not
defamation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does
invite
somebody
to
tell
a
lie
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does
invite
somebody
to
tell
a
lie?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
certainly
that
wasn't
public.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fbi's
probing
was
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it's
after
the
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
the
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
the
cia
too,
i
read
it,
i
mean
i
didn't
--
i
thought
these
were
secret
outfits.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
soble's
were
secret,
but
you
said
it
was
public.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
public
was
he?
everybody
did
know
about
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
you
first
hear
about
mr.
wolston,
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
before
he
walked
into
your
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
you
take
deposition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
that
the
first
time
you
heard
of
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
the
first
time
you
ever
heard
of
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
my
next
question
would
be
to
name
one
other
one
that
was
involved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
buckley,
trying
to
bring
you
back
to
my
brother
stewart's
point,
a
very
simple
question.
if
in
1950,
an
incident
occurred
when
a
man
was
admittedly
a
public
figure
that
you
and
i
and
everybody
else
agree
on.
and
something
had
published
in
1970,
and
he
is
now
going
to
a
monastery,
what
would
happen
on
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
would
that
be
determined
in
fact
to
whether
the
controversy
was
still
alive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
the
comment
pertains
solely
to
what
he
did
in
1950.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
went
to
publish
in
1970
as
protected
even
though
in
1970
he's
in
a
monastery.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
but
you
--
you're
injuring
a
man
who
is
a
private
figure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no.
in
1970
he's
in
the
monastery,
that's
rather
private.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
position?
