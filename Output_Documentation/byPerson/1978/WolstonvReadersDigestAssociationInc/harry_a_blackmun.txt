justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
your
argument
now
centers
on
1958
as
well
as
on
1974,
does
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
you
lose
on
the
form
or
if
he
were
a
public
figure
in
1958,
have
you
abandoned
the
argument
that
he
ceased
to
be
one
in
1974?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
i
ask
why?
you
made
the
argument
in
the
courts
below.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
it
--
would
the
passage
of
time
also
serve
to
impose
on
the
defendants
a
greater
measure
of
operation
in
the
recklessness
concept?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
haven't
you
lost
that
by
abandoning
your
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
doesn't
that
approach
really
restrict
the
public
figure
to
those
who
indulge
in
political
speech?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
buckley
this
is
why
i
asked
your
opponent
why
he
abandoned
the
passage
of
time
argument.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
that
has
to
be
your
position.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
long
there's
recklessness
in
it
there
is
a
difference.
