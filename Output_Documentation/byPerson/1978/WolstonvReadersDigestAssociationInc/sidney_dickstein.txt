mr.
sidney
dickstein
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
in
this
case
is
ilya
wolston
who
is
the
nephew
of
jack
and
myra
soble,
admitted
soviet
espionage
agents.
following
the
soble's
arrest
in
1957
in
their
later
plea
of
guilty
to
espionage
charges,
wolston
received
and
failed
to
comply
with
the
grand
jury
subpoena.
following
commencement
of
the
trial
on
the
resulting
contempt
charge,
wolston
pleaded
guilty,
received
a
one-year
suspended
sentence
conditioned
on
his
future
cooperation
with
federal
authorities
and
was
placed
on
three
years
probation.
newspaper
stories
relating
to
wolston's
failure
to
appear
in
his
contempt
hearing,
his
plea
and
his
sentence
were
published
between
july
15
and
august
14,
1958.
as
the
district
court
observed
however,
wolston
had
led
a
thoroughly
private
existence
and
was
generally
unknown
until
his
failure
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
became
public
knowledge.
and
after
the
flurry
of
publicity
attending
his
conviction
ceased,
he
apparently
succeeded
for
the
most
part
in
resuming
his
private
ways.
the
defamatory
statements
at
issue
here
are
found
in
a
book
entitled
kgb,
the
secret
work
of
soviet
agents,
which
was
written
by
john
barron
an
employee
of
the
reader's
digest
association
inc.
it
was
published
in
1974
by
reader's
digest
press
and
republished
by
two
book
clubs
and
in
paperback
by
bantam
books.
the
defamatory
statements
on
the
book
identified
petitioner
as
a
soviet
agent
undifferentiated
from
the
rosenbergs,
william
remington,
judith
coplon,
harry
gold,
and
other
infamous
figures
of
soviet
espionage.
a
footnote
to
the
identification
of
wolston
as
a
soviet
agent
can
be
read
to
mean
that
petitioners
--
petitioner
had
been
indicted
for
espionage
as
well
as
convicted
of
contempt
of
court.
following
petitioner's
filing
of
this
action
a
diversity
action
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
author
of
kgb
was
deposed.
he
testified
that
his
identification
of
wolston
as
a
soviet
agent
was
predicated
upon
a
1960
fbi
report
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
the
source
of
law
in
so
far
as
federal
issues
are
not
concerned
and
is
of
course
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
that
is
correct,
it
does.
barron
also
testified
that
prior
to
and
while
he
was
writing
kgb,
he
was
completely
familiar
with
the
book
entitled
“my
ten
years
as
a
counterspy”
which
was
written
by
boris
morros
and
published
in
1959.
in
this
book,
morros
recounts
that
soble
has
identified
his
nephew
wolston
as
“slava”
a
person
who
would
purportedly
furnish
soble
with
information.
morros'
book
referred
to
wolston
sentenced
for
contempt
of
court,
but
the
book
concluded
that
he
knew
nothing
about
wolston's
activities
except
that
which
soble
and
i
quote
“a
confirmed
liar”
had
told
him.
barron
testified
that
notwithstanding
his
authorization
to
invest
as
much
time
and
research
as
necessary
on
the
book,
the
full
backing
of
the
reader's
digest
organization,
the
assignment
to
him
of
a
fulltime
researcher,
his
use
of
the
worldwide
research
facilities
of
the
reader's
digest
and
cooperation
by
the
fbi
and
other
federal
agencies
which
had
been
assured
and
which
he
received.
in
the
over
four
years
that
this
book
was
in
preparation,
he
made
no
attempt
to
verify
the
information
set
out
in
the
book
concerning
wolston
and
relied
he
said
solely
on
the
fbi
report.
with
regard
to
the
footnote
reference
in
the
book
which
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
agreed
appear
to
state
falsely
that
wolston
had
been
indicted
for
espionage.
barron
testified
that
he
knew
that
wolston
had
not
been
indicted,
but
that
the
persons
to
which
the
note
refer,
which
included
wolston,
had
been
convicted
of
espionage
or
falsifying
information
or
perjury
and/or
contempt
charges.
and
that
i
take
it
meant
wolston
following
the
espionage
indictment
of
other
people.
in
support
of
the
defendant's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
barron
submitted
an
affidavit
in
which
he
says
“i
was
confident
upon
publication
of
kgb
that
the
book
as
a
whole
and
each
and
every
statement
in
it
were
true,
and
i
was
aware
of
no
fact
that
tended
to
make
me
doubt
the
truth
of
the
book
or
of
any
statement
in
it.”
he
added
that
“at
no
time
have
i
been
aware
of
any
fact
that
will
give
me
reason
to
doubt
the
fbi
report
or
any
statement
in
it.”
mr.
sidney
dickstein
that
is
the
normal
rule
of
course,
but
that
is
not
the
rule
that
was
followed
by
the
courts
below.
in
fact
that
is
not
the
rule
which
appears
to
pertain
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
there
is
a
special
rule
that
deals
with
matters
of
summary
--
deals
with
motions
for
summary
judgment
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
--
than
matters
involving
libel.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
it
seems
to
have
been
suggested
that
the
very
existence,
persistence
if
you
would
of
a
lawsuit
which
can
otherwise
be
nipped
in
the
bud
at
an
early
stage,
has
a
chilling
and
inhibiting
effect
upon
the
press
which
is
force
to
continue
to
defend
that
case
from
the
normal
processes
of
trial.
and
so,
summary
judgment
is
encouraged
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
as
well.
that
is
the
rule
that
was
applied
here,
because
as
we
think
is
evident
from
the
record,
and
i
refer
to
this.
if
inferences
were
drawn
which
could
fairly
have
been
drawn,
even
if
an
actual
malice
standard
were
to
have
been
applied,
a
jury
could've
concluded
that
barron
did
entertain
serious
doubts
about
the
truth
of
the
allegation,
the
accusation
that
wolston
was
a
soviet
agent
but
went
ahead
and
published
anyway.
the
courts
below
did
apply
the
actual
malice
standard
here.
purporting
to
follow
this
court's
opinions
in
gertz
and
firestone,
they
concluded
that
wolston
was
a
public
figure.
and
crediting
barron
self-serving
assertion,
they
concluded
that
malice
could
not
be
shown
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
defendants.
it
is
from
that
summary
judgment
that
we
are
before
this
court.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
we
did
in
fact
oppose
him,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
that
is
correct
precisely.
the
basis
for
the
conclusion
of
the
courts
below,
that
wolston
was
a
public
figure
subject
to
the
actual
malice
standard,
was
that
in
failing
to
comply
with
the
subpoena,
he
had
voluntarily
exposed
himself
to
the
publicity
that
might
and
did
in
fact
ensue.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
your
honor,
we
argued
in
the
courts
below
that
the
question
of
whether
one
is
or
is
not
a
public
figure
in
a
close
case
would
be
a
question
for
a
jury.
we
have
not
raised
that
here
and
we
don't
argue
it
here
because
we
do
not
think
this
is
a
close
case.
we
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
wolston
cannot
be
classified
as
a
public
figure
and
hence
no
fact
issue
arises
which
would
give
--
which
a
jury
would
have
to
consider.
it
is
possible
to
postulate
a
case,
to
hypothesize
a
case
in
which
an
individual
whose
--
to
whom
public
attention
was
drawn
as
a
consequence
of
action
which
was
contemptuous
or
in
any
other
way
in
violation
of
the
criminal
law,
could
be
said
to
have
made
a
political
statement
by
his
conduct.
one
--
the
case
of
a
hollywood
ten
is
brought
to
mind,
where
in
their
actions
which
were
at
one
in
the
same
time
held
to
be
in
contempt
of
congress.
it
was
clear
that
they
were
making
political
statements.
if
it
occurred
that
it
was
--
that
there
were
fact
issues
and
if
were
there
ambiguities
as
to
whether
or
not
someone
was
a
public
figure
under
those
circumstances,
then
possibly
a
jury
question
might
be
presented.
we
do
not
think
one
is
presented
here.
the
reason
why
the
courts
below
held
that
wolston
was
a
public
figure
beyond
any
question
of
a
doubt,
i
suppose,
was
that
they
found
in
his
actions
the
kind
of
voluntariness
which
this
court
they
said
had
in
mind
in
gertz.
our
reading
of
gertz
to
the
contrary
was
dismissed
just
too
literal,
too
restrictive.
but
we
submit
that
the
significant
language
of
this
court's
opinions
dealing
with
public
persons
simply
can
not
embrace
petitioner
wolston.
he
had
no
fame
or
notoriety
of
achievement.
certain
he
occupied
no
rule
of
special
prominence
in
the
inference
of
society,
nor
did
he
attempt
to
influence
society
with
respect
to
the
outcome
of
public
issues.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
yes,
it
does.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
yes,
we
have.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
upon
reflection,
and
i
must
say
in
part
at
least
persuaded
by
the
views
expressed
by
the
courts
below.
we
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
rights
of
privacy
and
the
rights
of
defamation
are
so
different
than
apart.
that
while
it
could
be
argued
that
one
who
had
lost
his
right
of
privacy
in
1958
would
have
had
it
restored
by
1974,
that
in
a
work
of
this
kind,
a
work
which
is
purportedly
and
i
suppose
on
its
face
to
be
regarded
as
a
reflective
work
of
history.
if
one
were
a
public
figure
in
1958,
one
would
remain
a
public
figure
for
the
purpose
of
commenting
upon
those
same
events
in
a
historical
work
published
in
1974.
and
so
yes,
your
honor,
we
did
abandon
that
contention.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
we
think
so
and
certainly
so,
in
fact
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
no,
we
don't
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
raised
in
our
reply
brief,
your
honor,
because
in
determining
what
is
reasonable
care
if
that
is
to
be
the
standard
if
negligence
is
applicable
here.
or
even
in
determining
actual
malice,
and
the
court
was
very
careful
to
note
in
st.
amant
but
what
the
definition
of
actual
malice
would
be
and
presumably
the
facts
which
would
support
it
would
vary
from
case
to
case.
we
think
the
circumstances
are
particularly
important.
here
where
there
was
an
interim
period
between
the
event
and
the
publication
of
16
years,
16
years
of
opportunity
for
reflection
and
four
years
of
writing
and
opportunity
for
determination,
for
research,
for
checking
out,
for
interviewing
and
those
opportunities
were
foregone.
we
believe
that
those
circumstances
demonstrate
negligence
in
the
first
instance,
and
we
believe
that
they
would
satisfy
the
actual
malice
standard
as
well
if
that
were
the
issue
here.
we
do
not
think
that
one
can
treat
this
book
as
if
it
were
a
hot
news
written
by
the
washington
post
say
on
the
morning
of
publication
of
the
fbi
report.
and
so
we
do
think
there's
a
difference
and
we
haven't
abandoned
that.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
this
is
being
in
form
of
porous
case.
the
reply
brief
was
not
printed.
i
do
not
believe
the
clerk
is
able
to
print
it
prior
to
the
argument
itself.
we
agree
that
wolston
by
his
actions
became
newsworthy,
and
it
is
clear
that
if
the
plurality
opinion
in
rosenbloom
were
the
law,
the
actual
malice
standard
would
be
applicable
to
petitioner's
case.
but
we
believe
it
strange
in
fact
distorts
the
plain
meaning
of
this
court's
opinion
in
gertz
to
equate
petitioner's
conduct
with
the
inviting
of
attention
and
public
comment,
which
is
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
a
public
figure.
it
has
been
said
that
we
read
gertz
too
literally,
but
we
think
the
court
meant
exactly
what
it
said
in
gertz.
to
invite
means
to
welcome,
to
solicit,
to
court,
to
entice
and
that
is
what
public
figures
indeed
do.
whether
they're
public
figures
for
all
purposes
or
for
single
issues,
for
unless
they
attract
public
attention,
they
can
not
achieve
their
purpose
and
it
is
precisely
because
they
purposefully
seek
public
attention
that
the
press
has
accorded
more
room
in
dealing
with
them.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
not
at
all.
the
public
issues,
which
i
think
are
the
concern
of
the
cases
beginning
with
times
v.
sullivan
in
its
project,
are
not
necessarily
limited
to
political
issues.
we
do
not
so
contend,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
so
held.
there
is
a
whole
range
of
public
issues
which
are
matters
of
public
concern,
but
the
focus
of
course
is
on
the
activities
of
the
--
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
defamation
suit
not
on
the
surrounding
circumstances
which
gave
rise
to
the
defamation.
there
are
other
ways
in
which
wolston
simply
does
not
match
up
to
what
this
court
has
held
a
public
figure
to
be
in
gertz
and
firestone.
one
thing
is
crystal
clear,
unlike
wally
butts
in
general
walker,
wolston
did
not
command
sufficient
continuing
public
interest
nor
to
be
have
sufficient
access
to
the
moons
of
counter-argument
to
be
able
to
expose
through
discussion
the
falsehood
and
fallacies
of
the
defamatory
statements.
one
wonders
how
these
falsehoods
could've
been
exposed.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
thank
you.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
and
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
we
would
probably
have
a
quite
a
different
case
here
if
mr.
wolston
had
challenged
the
fbi's
right
to
investigate
into
espionage
or
the
right
of
the
united
states
government
to
issue
a
subpoena
compelling
his
attendance
before
a
grand
jury
conducting
such
an
investigation.
but
one
thing
is
quite
clear
even
on
this
abbreviated
record
and
that
is
that
the
only
justification,
the
only
excuse
that
mr.
wolston
ever
gave
for
not
complying
was
his
physical
and
mental
condition
at
the
time
the
subpoena
was
issued.
he
did
not
take
a
position
in
this
public
controversy
with
a
view
toward
influencing
it.
indeed
if
one
looks
at
the
contemporaneous
newspaper
articles,
they
replete
with
references
to;
he
refused
to
comment,
he
disappeared,
he
could
not
be
reached.
and
when
you
read
the
article
concerning
the
event
of
the
trial,
it
certainly
appears
as
if
the
reason
why
he
terminated
the
trial
and
plead
guilty
was
because
he
wanted
to
resist
any
in
further
intrusion
into
his
privacy
and
the
privacy
of
his
family.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
we
are
not
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
not
as
i
understand
the
teaching
of
this
court's
opinions
in
gertz
and
firestone,
your
honor.
we're
not
suggesting
that
this
court
should
assume
that
wolston's
actions
were
non-volitional
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
or
not
he
was
a
public
figure.
in
fact,
we're
prepared
to
have
the
court
assume
that
they
were
volitional
that
he
did
not
obey
the
subpoena
and
that
he
was
properly
plead.
but
that
is
not
the
kind
of
activity
that
we
understand
is
spoken
of
in
gertz
and
in
firestone
as
to
making
him
a
public
figure.
mr.
buckley
has
asserted
that
this
is
a
very
evanescent
proposition.
how
can
the
press
expect
to
know
what
wolston's
state
of
mind
was
when
he
failed
to
obey
the
subpoena?
we've
never
suggested
that
for
one
moment,
but
we
have
said
is
that
there
is
not
a
scintilla,
there
was
not
a
scintilla
of
indication
that
wolston
was
refusing
to
obey
a
subpoena
in
order
to
have
impact
upon
the
processes,
the
controversy,
the
dispute
in
order
to
persuade
the
public
of
a
position
much
like
the
analogy
that
i
employed
in
my
opening
argument
with
respect
with
the
hollywood
ten.
no
guesswork
was
required
here.
but
what
if
the
standard
that
mr.
buckley
does
advocate,
he
suggests
that
perhaps
when
someone
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
some
special
things
occur.
at
that
point
at
least
he
becomes
a
public
figure.
well,
if
one
thinks
about
guesswork
in
terms
of
assessing
concrete
facts
then
self-evident,
what
about
the
crystal
balling
that
would
be
involved
in
application
of
such
a
standard?
the
press
would
rightfully
complain.
how
can
we
possibly
know
how
much
breathing
space
we
have?
how
much
room
we
have
for
error
in
commenting
upon
this
man's
conduct
in
the
trial
in
his
background
if
we
have
to
wait
until
conviction
and
final
judgment
before
we
know
whether
or
not
and
what
we
can
say?
indeed,
i
dare
suggest
that
given
the
criminal
processes
which
fortunately
have
speeded
somewhat
in
this
country.
in
most
instances,
the
statute
of
limitations
are
in
libel
in
most
jurisdictions
would've
run
long
before
the
press
could
fathom
the
extent
of
the
room
which
has
been
allowed
by
such
a
standard.
to
be
sure,
mr.
wolston
has
been
stripped
of
his
privacy.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
is
thereby
to
be
made
a
subject
of
additional
sanction
at
the
behest
of
the
reader's
digest.
judge
cashin,
20
years
ago
decided
what
was
an
inappropriate
sanction.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
actual
malice,
and
your
questions
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
the
actual
malice
standard
was
applicable
here
and
we
say
it
is
not
but
if
it
were
held
to
be.
the
question
would
then
be
whether
barron
had
serious
doubts
about
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
wolston
was
a
soviet
agent
but
went
ahead
and
published
it
anyway.
now
less
we
be
misunderstood,
we
are
not
suggesting
and
i
answered
before
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
there
is
a
varying
standard
depending
upon
the
length
of
time
that
has
occurred
since
the
events
which
ostensibly
are
purportedly
make
up
one
a
public
figure.
we
say
the
standard
is
the
same
but
the
manner
in
which
that
standard
is
to
be
applied
is
not
rigid.
it
must
take
in
a
consideration.
and
particularly
if
one
is
going
to
ascribe
to
the
balance,
the
accommodation
of
interest
referred
to
in
gertz
and
predecessor
opinions,
one
must
take
into
consideration
the
circumstances
of
publication.
and
hence
whether
you're
talking
about
actual
malice
or
negligence
or
the
minimal
standard
of
fault
permissible
by
gertz,
we
think
it
completely
appropriate
that
the
trier
of
fact,
the
jury
in
this
instance,
have
the
opportunity
to
determine
whether
or
not
whatever
standard
of
care
is
to
be
employed
was
employed
under
these
circumstances.
when
barron
testified,
when
barron
submitted
an
affidavit
that
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
about
any
statement
in
his
book,
i
submit
that
such
extravagant
overstatement
should've
been
self-impeaching,
instead
it
was
fully
credited.
when
he
said
“yes,
i
knew
about
morros'
view
of
soble's
credibility
that
he
was
a
confirmed
liar,
but
i
didn't
rely
upon
that.
i
relied
upon
this
fbi
report
and
did
the
two
put
together
create
any
doubt
in
my
mind?”
mr.
sidney
dickstein
your
honor,
there
is
so
much
in
that
book
which
is
just
completely
inconsistent
that
is
in
which
slava
as
described
is
completely
inconsistent
with
wolston,
the
man
as
he
live.
there
is
more
than
that.
we
are
talking
about
an
accusation
made,
a
statement,
a
report
if
you
would,
filed
by
the
fbi
in
1960
at
the
time
when
it
was
known
that
accusations
of
this
kind
were
rampant
and
often
overstated.
we
have
a
period
of
time
which
ran
since.
we
also
have
the
indisputable
fact
known
to
barron
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
there
are
other
circumstances,
your
honor.
there
is
an
--
i'm
not
necessarily
saying
i
noticed.
i
think
the
man
was
unnoticed.
and
the
question
was;
what
was
his
own
self-assessment
as
to
the
extent
to
which
he
entertained
doubts?
the
mere
fact
as
he
knew
it
that
wolston
was
in
the
grip
of
federal
prosecutorial
power
and
yet
was
never
indicted
for
espionage
should've
said
something
to
him.
all
of
these
things,
but
what
--
but
barron's
testimony
at
deposition
was
not
only
extravagant
and
self-serving,
some
of
it
sounded
like
a
lawyer's
post
litem
inventions.
that
in
and
of
itself
should've
enabled
us
to
challenge
his
credibility,
this
overbroad
statement
with
respect
to
every
proposition
in
his
book
being
true,
that
should've
been
a
basis
for
assessing
his
credibility,
the
fact
that
he
saw
no
need
to
research
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
these
facilities.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
given
the
facts
that
we
have,
if
a
jury
believed
that
barron
was
lying,
we
think
that
that
alone
would've
been
sufficient.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
oh,
but
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
if
there
is
--
if
there
are
facts
and
circumstances
because
there
are
here
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
standing
by
itself,
if
that
were
the
--
if
those
were
the
facts
here,
that
might
be
the
case.
but
it
does
not
stand
by
itself.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
because
there
are.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
objectively.
there
was
the
fact
that
wolston
was
never
indicted
for
espionage.
there
was
the
fact
that
soble
who
--
while
the
witness
denies
that
that
was
the
only
basis
for
the
fbi
report
was
characterized
as
a
liar
by
one
who
knew
him
best.
there
were
facts
in
the
fbi
report
and
in
the
morros
book
which
apart
--
which
demonstrably
had
no
bearing
and
no
connection
with
wolston.
they
could
not
be
one
and
the
same
person.
there
was
the
fact
that
in
the
morros
book,
morros
clearly
suggest
that
in
his
view,
soble
was
putting
him
on
in
order
to
get
some
money
out
of
him,
in
order
to
cool
him
--
what
he
refers
to
with
respect
to
his
--
soble's
always
declining,
always
finding
excuses
so
that
morros
could
not
meet
wolston
the
slava.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
exactly.
and
this
case
was
disposed
off
on
summary
judgment.
