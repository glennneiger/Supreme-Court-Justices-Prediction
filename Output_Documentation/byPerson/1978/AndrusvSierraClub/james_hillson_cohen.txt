mr.
james
hillson
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
national
environmental
policy
act
of
1969
is
this
nation's
charter
for
the
protection
of
the
environment.
the
action
forcing
mechanisms
in
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
nepa
are
intended
to
serve
an
invaluable
management
tool
for
the
purposes
of
agency
decision
making.
by
so
doing,
nepa
has
over
the
course
of
time
actually
reduced
cost
and
mitigated
adverse
effects
upon
the
environment
by
increasing
the
planning
process
during
the
development
of
agency
proposals
for
either
legislation,
or
proposals
for
major
federal
action.
this
case
involves
the
plain
language
of
nepa,
section
102
(2)
(c)
and
indicates
that
every
agency
is
to
use
all
practicable
means
at
the
earliest
possible
stage
in
decision
making,
and
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
in
incorporating
nepa
into
its
decision
making
process.
under
the
terms
of
this
court's
opinion
in
flint
ridge,
the
court
has
indicated
that
unless
there
is
an
expressed
prohibition
or
unless
compliance
is
impossible
with
nepa,
nepa
and
the
action
forcing
requirements
of
the
environmental
impact
statement
are
intended
to
apply
to
that.
nepa's
language,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
the
consistent
and
contemporaneous
interpretations
by
the
counsel
on
environmental
quality
for
nearly
a
decade
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
--
under
the
terms
of
nepa,
ceq
was
created
and
under
the
terms
of
two
separate
executive
orders
issued
by
the
president,
ceq
was
empowered
to
develop
guidelines
and
ultimately
regulations
implementing
and
interpreting
nepa.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
in
except
in
so
far
as
ceq
itself
was
directed
under
the
terms
of
nepa
to
assist
in
agency
decision
making
in
terms
of
the
interpretations
for
implementing
nepa,
and
i'm
speaking
now
of
section
102
(2)
(b)
of
the
act.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
we
certainly
feel
your
honor
that
the
ability
by
ceq
to
prepare
these
guidelines
and
regulations
has
at
least
the
same
authority
as
those
which
would
emanate
from
the
congress.
they
--
ceq
was
created
under
nepa.
it
implemented
regulations
through
two
separate
executive
orders
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
this
court
has
given
deference
to
agency
regulations
including
the
council
on
environmental
quality
or
with
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
that
is
correct
your
honor
in
so
far
as
the
authority
for
ceq
to
actually
interpret
the
act,
that
is
correct.
we
are
relying
upon
the
executive
orders
and
as
i
indicated,
the
inherent
authority
under
nepa
itself.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
ceq
is
not
still
of
the
view
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
well
it
is
our
contention
as
we
have
indicated
your
honor
that
the
deference
ought
to
be
accorded
to
eight
years
of
consistent
and
contemporaneous
interpretation.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
we
are
concerned,
as
we've
indicated,
your
honor,
that
the
interpretations
are
without
any
reasonable
basis
in
so
far
as
under
the
new
interpretations
they
provide
and
express
exclusion
for
budget
request
from
the
definition
of
legislation.
now
under
the
previous
three
sets
of
guidelines
from
the
counsel
and
environmental
quality,
the
definition
of
legislation
was
not
provided.
in
point
of
fact
there
was
a
definition
of
actions
which
incorporated
explicitly
the
terms
of
budget
request
including
appropriations
request.
and
we
believe
that
this
consistent
interpretation,
particularly
in
view
of
the
general
electric
case
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
wrote,
indicate
that
there
is
no
new
development.
that
there
is
no
new
source
of
a
legislation
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
i
believe
ceq
has
indicated
in
its
regulations
themselves,
your
honor
that
it
felt
that
the
budget
process
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
i
believe
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
critical
importance
of
the
budget
process
itself
and
federal
--
in
federal
agency
decision
making
we
feel
ought
not
to
be
underestimated.
the
legislative
history
of
the
budget
process
indicates
quite
clearly,
we
believe,
that
the
action
forcing
mechanism
of
budget
allocations
and
resource
decisions
at
the
agency
level
which
go
on
for
nearly
10
months
represent
a
significant
stage
in
agency
decision
making.
in
point
of
fact,
the
legislative
history
has
indicated
that
the
budget
process
represents
the
judgment
book
by
which
agencies
live
and
by
which
agencies
die.
and
we
feel
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
critical
process
whereby
a
decision
comes
from
the
agency
in
the
form
of
a
proposal
to
omb
and
ultimately
for
legislation
or
major
federal
action
to
the
congress
represents
an
appropriate
stage
under
the
terms
of
kleppe
where
the
proposal
has
reached
the
stage
of
sufficient
maturity
and
sufficient
definiteness
to
be
accorded
the
weight
that
it
should
be
accorded
in
the
form
of
a
--
an
eis.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
well
under
the
terms
of
the
budget
in
accounting
act,
your
honor,
we'll
recall
that
the
president
transmit
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
the
president
transmits
the
budget
to
the
congress,
whereas
the
--
under
section
206
--
201
rather
of
the
act,
the
agency
head
is
required
to
prepare
the
budget.
and
this
preparation
goes
on
for
some
ten
months.
and
we
believe
that
by
the
time
it
has
reached
the
stage
where
it
is
forwarded
to
omb.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
after
it
goes
through
omb,
your
honor,
it
then
is
transmitted
to
the
president
for
his
formal
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
we
certainly
do
not
your
honor.
we
feel
that
one
environmental
impact
statement
is
all
that
needs
to
be
required.
it
needs
to
be
required
in
the
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
indeed
that
represents
the
particular
instance
where
an
environmental
impact
statement
would
be
most
needed
and
most
valuable,
because
it
would
serve.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
the
eis
would
be
prepared
by
the
agency
for
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
we
would
submit
that
it
is
not
your
honor
that
the
eis
has
served
its
purpose
of
assisting
in
identifying
in
considering
environmental
consequences
by
the
time
the
forwarding
agency
which
is
prepared
the
budget
forwards
its
submission
to
omb.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
we
are
supporting
the
proposition
articulated
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
only
in
those
instances
where
the
agency
has
actually
undergone
a
careful
review
of
its
program
and
has
determined
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
it
may
be,
your
honor,
and
we
would
submit
that
so
long
as
the
environmental
considerations
have
been
identified
and
analyzed
and
the
president
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
if
the
program
commitment
of
resources
to
the
program
represents
a
programmatic
course
of
action
following
a
review
then
we
would
submit
that
the
agency
forwarding
its
budget
request
would
have
to
prepare
an
eis.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
that
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
your
honor,
the
question
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
addressed
to
opposing
counsel
as
i
understood
it
was
a
--
involved
a
situation
where
the
forwarding
the
agency
had
determined
that
it
wished
to
dramatically
reduce
or
to
eliminate
a
program
from
its
program
commitments.
i
did
not
understand
the
hypothetical
which
you
presented
to
be
one
where
the
omb
itself
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
well,
we
would
submit
it
is,
your
honor.
it
does
make
a
difference
in
so
far
as
the
eis
serves
in
the
agency
decision
making
process
at
the
budget
forwarding
level.
now
if
the
court
is
suggesting
that
there
may
be
a
proposal
which
is
made
by
the
office
of
management
and
the
budget
in
the
form
a
dramatic
cutback
of
a
program,
of
course
we
would
suggest
that
that
may
be
the
time
when
there
is
a
proposal.
we
have
indicated
in
our
pleadings
before
the
district
court
as
well
as
before
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
proposal
is
made
by
the
time
it
is
--
the
budget
request
is
forwarded
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
we
believe
that
the
eis
needs
to
be
prepared
at
the
time
it
leaves
the
forwarding
agency
and
before
it
gets
to
omb.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
we
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
it
is
a
proposal
by
the
time
it
leaves
the
agency
and
goes
to
omb.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
no,
we
would
submit
that
only
one
eis
needs
to
be
prepared
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
--
from
the
agency.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
well
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
preparation
of
an
eis,
even
if
it
were
not
publicly
disclosed
and
not
made
available
for
comment
to
the
public
until
the
budget
request
were
submitted
to
the
congress.
at
very
least,
omb
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
would
have
the
benefit
of
reviewing
in
determining
the
environmental
consequences
that
might
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
we
would
assume,
your
honor,
that
in
the
very
limited
number
of
instances
where
an
eis
would
need
to
be
prepared
under
the
articulation
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
in
those
few
instances,
the
president
and
his
staff
would
be
available
to
review
significant
environmental
consequences
of
a
considered
programmatic
review
which
issues
--
ushers
in
a
programmatic
course
of
action.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
i
believe
that
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
we
believe
that
the
president
certainly
could
ask
for
an
eis.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
we
have
no
doubt,
your
honor.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
believe
that
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
it
doesn't
solve
the
problem,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
hillson
cohen
our
point
is
that
one
is
required
under
the
terms
of
nepa
itself
and
more
importantly
that
the
primary
purpose
of
an
environmental
impact
statement
is
to
serve
the
agency
which
is
making
a
proposal
for
legislation,
or
making
a
proposal
for
major
federal
action.
and
that
the
eis
needs
to
be
prepared
not
as
an
post
hoc
justification
for
an
allocation
on
the
part
of
an
agency
for
a
particular
program.
but
rather
in
order
to
analyze
the
potential
consequences
over
proposal.
in
fact
the
terms
of
nepa
itself
speak
as
if
a
proposal
might
be
implemented.
section
102
(2)
(c)
says
that
“should
a
proposal
be
implemented”
indicating
that
not
all
of
the
final
decisions
will
have
been
made
regarding
budget
allocations
and
regarding
commitments
to
funding
for
a
given
program.
under
the
terms
of
nepa,
we
would
suggest
that
if
the
congress
had
intended
to
exclude
such
a
major
function
of
the
governmental
process
from
the
terms
of
nepa,
it
would
have
done
so
expressly.
indeed,
the
freedom
of
information
act
passed
approximately
fours
years
prior
to
nepa,
did
expressly
exclude
various
forms
of
documents
from
public
disclosure
and
that
congress
could
well
have
said
in
passing
nepa
that
it
intended
to
exclude
budget
requests
from
proposals
for
legislation
or
proposals
for
major
federal
action.
it
did
not
do
so.
those
federal
courts
which
have
interpreted
nepa
and
the
budget
process
have
also
suggested
and
held
that
eis
need
to
be
prepared
for
budget
request.
in
addition,
ceq
has
consistently
stated
as
we
indicated
that
budget
requests
for
appropriations
need
to
be
accompanied
by
environmental
impact
statements.
even
the
implementing
agency
regulations
have
indicated
that
nepa
covers
their
budget
requests,
although
none
have
ever
complied.
the
proposal
for
legislation
in
this
case,
we
believe
clearly
covers
a
budget
request
and
that
the
term
legislation
is
intended
to
embrace
the
--
and
appropriations.
in
addition,
the
term
major
federal
actions,
we
believe
embraces
the
term
budget
request
or
a
request
for
appropriations.
in
many
instances,
discrete
federal
projects
have
been
accorded
environmental
impact
statement
coverage,
and
we
believe
that
in
an
instance
where
a
discrete
federal
project
is
subject
to
the
terms
of
the
act,
it
certainly
a
decision
by
the
agency
to
commit
major
resources
represents
the
first
and
critical
significant
decision
at
the
agency
level
which
would
warrant
an
eis
for
that
proposal.
the
government
has
indicated
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
terms
of
the
budget
and
accounting
act
of
1921
and
the
terms
of
nepa.
and
we
would
submit
that
in
fact
is
not
the
case.
there
is
no
conflict.
there
is
no
conflict
and
under
the
terms
of
the
act
itself,
confidentiality
is
not
provided
and
environmental
impact
statement
is
an
independently
prepared
document,
one
which
can
serve
the
purpose
of
agency
decision
making
and
which
would
not
require
the
disclosure
of
actual
budget
materials.
in
addition,
any
documents
which
are
made
available
to
the
public
can
be
made
available
in
accordance
with
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
we
would
submit
that
in
this
circumstance
where
there
are
limited
number
of
instances
involving
a
limited
number
of
programs
that
the
budget
request
process
is
covered
by
nepa.
thank
you,
your
honor.
