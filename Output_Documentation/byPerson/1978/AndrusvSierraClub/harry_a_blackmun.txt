justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
what
is
your
position
as
to
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
we
hold
they
are
then
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
i
followed
you
with
respect
to
a
positive
proposal
to
build
a
dam.
but
suppose
that
interior
has
already
established
an
ongoing
program
for
wildlife
refuge,
and
suppose
then
that
the
word
comes
down
to
cut
interiors
budget
by
10%?
and
so
they
reflect
this
in
their
budget
request
by
eliminating
funds
for
that
particular
program.
if
a
statement
is
not
required
there,
it
never
will
be
required.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
drawing
the
distinction
between
a
positive
action
and
a
negative
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
keep
putting
the
word
final
in
their
final
proposal.
the
statute
doesn't
use
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
i
must
confess,
for
me
the
word
proposal
reeks
of
something
that
is
not
final.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
interrupt
you
also.
isn't
this
the
question
i
asked
opposing
counsel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
it
make
a
difference?
