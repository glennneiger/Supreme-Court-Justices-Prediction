justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
understand
this
holding
to
be
for
the
presumed
benefit
of
the
agencies
who
are
submitting
their
requests
to
omb,
or
for
omb
in
submitting
its
recommendations
to
the
president?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
get
any
sense
that
there
is
balance
of
taken
a
“new
look”
at
their
position
from
their
brief
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
cohen,
if
i
may
about
the
regulations
by
the
ceq?
congress
did
not
grant
the
ceq
authority
to
issue
rules
and
regulations
interpreting
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
--
though
that
authority
extends
from
an
executive
order
and
not
from
an
act
of
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that's
the
same
thing
as
the
authority
congress
has
conferred
on
some
agencies
to
issue
rules
and
regulations
interpreting
meaning
of
this
legislative
section
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
relying
on
an
executive
order
then
yet
the
executive
branch
is
here
arguing
against
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
supposing
that
the
national
wildlife
and
refuge
service
proposes
a
100%
increase
in
its
budget
to
omb
so
they
can
acquire
a
good
deal
of
new
land
for
wildlife
refuges.
and
under
your
view,
i
take
it,
it
ought
to
submit
an
eis
in
connection
with
that.
and
then
omb
says
“quite
the
contrary,
we're
going
to
dissolve
nwrs
and
sell
it
off
to
the
private
investors
to
build
condominiums.”
now,
do
you
need
two
eis,
one
from
the
agency
and
one
from
omb
in
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where?
