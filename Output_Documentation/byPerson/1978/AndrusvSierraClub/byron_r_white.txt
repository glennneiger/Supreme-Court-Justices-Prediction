justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
scenario
of
zero
budgeting,
i
guess
it
would
that
approach?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
--
which
--
oh,
excuse
me
mr.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
ceq
still
of
the
view
that
you
suggest?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
which
view
do
we
give
deference
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
this
suit
had
come
up
ten
years
from
now,
you'd
give
deference
to
the
most
recent
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
don't
you
think
the
--
is
it
correct
or
not
that
ceq
now
is
before
this
court
in
the
--
through
the
united
states
indicating
that
these
requests
should
not
be
within
the
reach
of
nepa?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
you
--
is
essentially
being
represented
here
by
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
omb's
proposals
to
the
president
or
recommendations?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i'm
sure
that
i
don't
recall
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
what's
the
next
step
after
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
that
stage,
because
there're
a
lot
of
changes
go
on
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
omb.
do
you
think
another
round
of
statements?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
omb
just
cancels
out
a
proposal
or
decides
to
shut
down
the
existing
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
thought
you
said
you
didn't
need
a
statement
supporting
an
omb
recommendation
of
the
president?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
the
agency
has
prepared
one,
let's
just
say
--
assume
the
agency
has
prepared
one
and
it
wants
to
have
a
new
program
or
it
wants
to
continue
an
existing
program.
and
the
omb
disagrees
with
it
on
both
counts.
it
won't
start
the
new
program
and
it
won't
continue
the
old
one.
does
that
decision
require
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
argue
that
if
that
an
agency
that
just
wants
the
same
money
that
it
did
last
year
for
the
same
program
needs
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
a
--
the
department
of
interior
has
program
“x”
that's
been
going
on
for
20
years
and
every
year
it
has
taken
“y”
dollars,
and
again
it
submits
its
budget
proposal
to
omb,
program
“x”
for
“y”
dollars.
does
that
require
an
eis
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
is
your
answer
is
no
to
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it
goes
to
omb
and
omb
says,
“we
look
at
this
‘x'
program
for
‘y'
dollars,
it's
gone
long
enough.
no
more
‘x'
program
for
‘y'
dollars."
now
there
is
a
--
that's
quite
a
change.
and
it
might
be
illuminating
a
--
some
dark
line
somewhat,
you
know
what
i
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
they'd
never
been,
they'd
never
been.
the
agency
is
never
submitted
an
eis
on
this
program
it's
been
going
for
20
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
in
my
example
it
did
not
have
to
submit
one.
but
the
omb
cut
the
program
out
on
its
own.
the
agency
didn't
propose
it.
omb
just
decided
that
this
program
has
gone
on
long
enough.
and
you
say
it
still
you
wouldn't
need
an
eis
there.
