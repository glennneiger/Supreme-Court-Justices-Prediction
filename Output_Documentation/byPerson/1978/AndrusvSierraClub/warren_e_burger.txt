we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
625,
andrus
against
the
sierra
club.
mr.
harmon,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
mr.
harmon
that
some
of
the
actions
of
the
400
plus
district
judges
in
the
united
states
and
soon
well
over
a
hundred
circuit
judges
to
say
nothing
of
other
judges,
might
have
an
impact
on
the
human
environment.
does
that
mean
the
judicial
budget
would
have
to
have
an
impact
statement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
thrust
of
my
question
was
partly
about
impact
as
a
--
it's
really
pretty
difficult
to
major
isn't
it,
to
define
and
to
bound?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
analogize
it
mr.
harmon
to
the
process
which
a
division
of
a
department
submits
to
the
head
of
the
department
before
the
department
itself
submits
the
total
budget
request
to
the
omb.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
at
least
a
proposal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
final
when
it
goes
up
to
the
congress
from
the
president
in
that
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
could
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
entirely
independent
of
this
particular
legislation.
a
committee
of
the
congress
or
the
congress
as
a
whole
when
any
legislative
proposal
was
submitted
by
any
department
could
say
“prepare
an
impact
statement
or
we
aren't
going
to
pull
in
a
hearing.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
can
do
that
at
every
stage
while
they're
considering
the
legislation
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
program
that
we're
talking
about
that
mr.
justice
white
has
postulated
is
a
program
of
$200
million
for
clean
air
and
the
omb
just
cuts
it
out.
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
you
really
said
it
two
ways
that
it's
a
proposal
then
it
goes
from
omb
to
the
president
that
it's
also
a
proposal
then
it
goes
from
the
agency
to
the
omb
in
the
first
instance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
the
president,
he
might
not
--
he
might
be
too
busy
to
know
what
the
agency
proposed
then
he's
going
to
be
perhaps
victimized
and
the
environment
victimized
by
the
omb?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
you
don't
really
think
that
the
president
going
through
budgets
which
are
like
several
new
york
telephone
books
is
going
to
be
when
you
look
at
the
impact
statements
on
very
many
of
those
programs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
harmon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
