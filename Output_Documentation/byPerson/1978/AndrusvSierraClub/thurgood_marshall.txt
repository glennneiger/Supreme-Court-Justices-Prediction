justice
thurgood
marshall
when
does
it
the
proposal
become
final?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
you're
going
to
say
to
what
congress
acts?
it's
no
longer
proposal
then.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
your
position
that
you
don't
need
any
statements
until
after
it
gets
to
congress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
when?
well
when
would
you
be
obliged
to
file
the
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
by
--
nobody
will
ever
have
to
file
the
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
that's
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
why
didn't
you
use
the
word
proposal
at
all?
according
to
you,
you
don't
need
any
impact
statements
on
any
proposal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
the
department
of
interior
wants
to
propose
that
you
build
a
dam
and
somebody
from
congress
suggests
that.
and
eventually
it
gets
to
congress
and
congress
adopts
it.
now,
all
i'm
asking
you
is
when
is
that
a
proposal
and
when
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
this
one
item.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
question
is,
when
does
it
need
the
impact
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
be
required
in
order
to
require
the
impact
statement
in
the
interior
department?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
make
it
a
proposal,
the
word
proposal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
all
final
plans
proposals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
final
plans
for
a
legislation
are
a
proposals
under
this
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
really
don't
approve.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
congress
doesn't
do
it
in
a
particular
act?
that
will
violate
the
statute,
i
don't
think
congress
did,
i
said
the
department
of
interior
did.
i
don't
---
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
--
i
didn't
know
if
(inaudible)
this
act
was
whether
congress
asked
for
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
congress
could
said
that,
couldn't
it
very
easily?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
congress
didn't
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
order
to
maintain
you
position,
you
don't
have
to
move
so
far
as
to
say
all
budgetary
items
are
immunized,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
cohen,
is
there
anything
to
stop
the
president
for
asking
for
it,
assuming
there's
nothing
there?
couldn't
he
ask
for
an
eis?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
believe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
believe
he
--
you
have
some
doubt
that
he
could
ask
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
and
same
thing
congress
could
ask
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
that
solve
your
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
president
wants
it
he
can
get
it.
