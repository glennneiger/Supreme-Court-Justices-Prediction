mr.
john
m.
harmon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
national
environmental
policy
act
requires
executive
agencies
to
prepare
environmental
impact
statements
for
their
annual
budget
estimates
submitted
to
omb
for
consideration
in
the
preparation
of
the
president's
budget.
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
nepa
provides
that
all
agencies
shall
include
an
environmental
impact
statement
in
every
recommendation
or
report
on
proposals
for
legislation
and
other
major
federal
actions
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.
respondents
brought
this
action
in
july
1974
against
the
secretary
of
interior
and
the
director
of
omb
alleging
that
the
members
of
their
respective
organizations
were
adversely
affected
in
their
use
of
the
national
wildlife
refuge
system
by
certain
proposals
by
the
department
of
interior
and
omb
for
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
refuge
system.
the
respondents
claimed
that
the
annual
budget
request
prepared
by
the
secretary
of
interior
and
submitted
to
omb
were
proposals
for
legislation
and
other
major
federal
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
environmental
protection
act,
and
therefore
required
the
preparation
of
environmental
impact
statements.
the
respondents
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
to
this
effect.
they
also
sought
a
declaration
that
nepa
requires
omb
to
prepare
procedures
and
guidelines
to
identify
budget
submissions
by
other
agencies
which
require
the
preparation
of
environmental
impact
statements.
the
district
court
granted
the
respondent's
motion
for
summary
judgment
holding
that
every
budget
estimate
of
an
agency
whose
activities
significantly
impact
on
the
environment
is
a
proposal
for
legislation
and
other
major
federal
action.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
sense
--
in
the
theory
of
this
case
that
in
fact
the
actions,
a
decision
would
necessitate
action
below
that
may
be
major
federal
action
significantly
affecting
the
environment
on
that
theory.
again,
that
would
be
the
follow
through.
however,
the
environmental
impact
statement
requirements
of
nepa
do
not
apply
to
the
judicial
branch
or
to
the
president.
it's
our
contention
that
they
apply
to
all
agencies,
executive
agencies
within
the
executive
branch.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
well,
that
is
certainly
our
contention
in
the
sense
that
the
argument
made
by
respondents
throughout
this
case
indeed
adopted
by
the
district
court
was
that
the
budget
estimates
submitted
by
an
agency
in
fact
were
proposals
for
all
the
actions
which
would
be
financed
by
the
appropriation.
and
that
in
that
sense
that
the
decisions,
the
budget
decision
was
a
decision
to
take
those
major
federal
actions
with
the
significant
environmental
impact,
and
that
is
the
broad
reading
that
the
district
court
in
fact
accepted
in
this
case.
the
district
court
ordered,
directed
the
secretary
of
interior,
the
director
of
omb
to
prepare
and
consider
environmental
statements
for
each
annual
budget
request
for
the
national
wildlife
refuge
system.
in
addition,
the
district
court
held
that
nepa
requires
omb
to
prepare
procedures
to
identify
all
budget
estimates
which
require
an
environmental
impact
statement.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
it
is
our
understanding
of
the
holding,
your
honors
that
in
fact
it
is
for
the
benefit,
the
identification
for
the
agencies
which
would
be
submitting
their
requests
to
omb.
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
respondents
have
sought
an
--
the
filing
of
an
environmental
impact
statement.
the
court
below
did
not
discuss
the
submission
of
omb
to
the
president
for
the
consideration
in
the
budget.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
your
honor,
that
is
our
contention,
the
contention
we
have
made
in
our
reply
brief
which
we
have
filed
for
this
court.
in
fact,
we
think
that
the
application
of
an
environmental
impact
statement
requirement
to
a
submission
by
omb
in
its
function,
in
its
budget
function
and
the
parts
of
omb
which
provide
and
are
specifically
established
for
the
purpose
of
providing
advice
and
information
to
the
president
and
the
preparation
of
the
president's
budget
are
in
fact
beyond
the
reach
of
nepa.
and
for
that
reason,
that
application
would
raise
a
new
issue
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
district
courts
per
se
rule
that
every
budget
request
is
a
proposal
for
legislation.
instead,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
its
own
per
se
rule
that
every
budget
estimate,
every
budget
request
which
is
taken
after
a
new
look
and
in
depth
programmatic
review
of
a
program,
or
which
involved
a
significant
change
in
the
status
quo
in
the
current
level
of
funding
that
those
budget
estimates
were
in
fact
proposals
for
legislation.
however,
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
it
is
our
position
that
one,
these
are
not
proposals
that
the
budget
estimate
submitted
by
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
even
if,
even
if
the
budget
estimate
is
found
by
this
court
to
be
a
proposal
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
it's
our
position
that
they
are
not
a
proposal
for
legislation.
it's
our
position
that
congress
observed
the
traditional
distinction
that
is
maintained
between
the
legislation
and
appropriations
and
did
not
intend
to
reach
proposals
for
appropriations
as
distinguished
from
legislation.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
your
honor
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
and
i
appreciate
your
point.
the
--
in
our
position
on
that
is
that
the,
first
in
the
real
sense
the
budget
decision
a
10%
cut
on
a
particular
program,
the
decision
is
made,
the
budget,
the
appropriations
decision,
the
funding
decision,
the
economic
decision
and
the
political
decision
made
by
the
president
as
to
what
the
shape
and
content
of
his
budget
will
be.
that
is
made
first.
the
implementation
of
that
decision
must
await
of
course
the
approval
by
the
full
congress
of
that
appropriation
request.
but
in
the
real
sense,
there
is
no
concrete,
in
most
instances,
there
is
no
concrete
proposal
with
respect
to
what
interior
will
do
with
this
program
or
that
program,
whether
it
will
not
complete
this
dam
or
will
undertake
--
will
cut
enforcement
personnel
in
another
area.
those
decisions
in
the
main,
in
the
real
sense
are
made
subsequent
to
the
budget
decision,
the
paper
decision.
the
decision
to
which
you
refer,
the
action,
the
major
federal
action
if
it
might
be
determined
to
be
so,
is
an
underlying
action.
an
underlying
project,
an
underlying
decision
we
acknowledge
as
we
must
that
in
fact
the
underlying
project
beginning
or
ending
might
in
fact
require
an
environmental
impact
statement
depending
upon
the
analysis
of
the
given
situation,
the
given
factual
situation.
but
it
is
the
underlying
project,
the
underlying
action
and
not
the
appropriation
which
is
the
major
federal
action
under
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
again
subsequent
to
the
district
court's
decision,
the
department
of
interior
did
prepare
a
detailed
policy
review
of
the
refuge
system
program.
the
court
of
appeals
had
that
review
before
it
and
held
that
this
programmatic
review
satisfied
the
government's
current
obligations
under
nepa
with
respect
to
the
annual
budget
request
for
the
national
wildlife
refuge
system.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
added
and
held
that
in
the
event
of
any
significant
change
in
the
status
quo,
or
any
re-evaluation
of
the
refuge
program,
the
environmental
impact
statement
requirements
would
apply
anew.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
affirm
that
part
of
the
district
court's
decision
that
nepa
does
require
omb
to
formulate
procedures
to
identify
the
agency,
the
annual
agency
estimates
which
must
be
accompanied
by
an
environmental
impact
statement.
as
i
have
tried
to
outline,
we
would
make
three
arguments
to
support
our
position
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
the
first,
as
i've
again
attempted
to
describe
is
that
the
annual
budget
estimate
submitted
to
omb
for
consideration
in
the
preparation
of
the
president's
budget
is
not
a
proposal
as
that
term
is
used
in
nepa.
in
the
executive
budget
process,
the
point
at
which
there
is
a
proposal,
a
formal
proposal
as
that
term
was
defined
by
this
court's
decision
in
kleppe
versus
sierra
club
is
when
the
president
submits
his
budget
to
the
congress.
the
annual
budget
estimates
which
are
prepared
by
the
agencies
submitted
to
omb
in
september
for
consideration
in
the
preparation
of
the
president's
budget
are
but
part
of
the
germination
process
leading
to
the
final
proposal,
again
the
president's
budget.
respondents
argue
that
these
budget
estimates
are
final
proposals
because
the
agency
is
--
no
further
action
is
required
by
the
agency.
but
the
fact
that
the
agency
may
have
had
its
last
word
on
a
budget
proposal,
a
budget
estimate,
does
not
make
that
a
final
proposal.
indeed
congress
has
vested
in
the
president
the
exclusive
statutory
authority
to
prepare
and
submit
to
the
congress
the
budget.
that
was
in
the
budget
in
the
accounting
act
of
1921
in
that
same
statute,
congress
expressly
prohibited
the
agencies
from
submitting
independent
budgets
to
the
congress.
since
the
agencies
neither
have
the
authority,
indeed
they
are
expressly
precluded
from
submitting
these
budget
estimates
to
the
congress.
those
estimates
can
only
be
part
of
the
process
of
the
development
of
a
final
proposal,
the
president's
budget.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
mr.
chief
justice
it
would
be
exactly
our
point
that
if
the
respondents
contention
were
correct
that
the
fact
that
the
agency
has
had
its
final
word,
its
last
say
that
no
further
action
is
required
by
the
agency.
if
that
made
this
a
final
proposal
then
as
you
suggest
that
each
stage
of
the
way,
and
that's
the
way
the
budget
process
works
from
the
field
office,
from
the
person
located
in
charge
of
an
individual
refuge
area
all
the
way
up,
at
each
level
of
review
with
a
broader
perspective
that
at
each
level
there
would
be
a
final
proposal,
if
that
were
the
law.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
the
statute
does
not
use
that,
your
honor,
but
this
court
used
that
phraseology
in
kleppe,
in
its
decision
in
kleppe
versus
sierra
club.
in
that
case
as
here,
at
various
stages
there
is
contemplated
action.
there
is
input
from
the
various
sectors
of
an
agency,
and
our
case
the
various
sectors
of
the
government
--
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
and
those
suggestions,
considerations,
discussion
are
part
of
what
the
court
described
as
the
germination
process
to
produce
a
final
proposal.
our
position
is
that
in
this
case,
only
the
president,
only
the
president
has
the
authority
to
make
a
final
proposal.
and
in
fact
he
will,
does,
can
revise,
change
the
budget
proposals
as
they
come
to
him.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
certainly
not.
the
proposal,
the
proposal
in
that
sense
and
that
gives
us
a
good
context
in
which
to
consider
the
finality
of
a
proposal.
the
proposal
itself
as
it
goes
through
the
of
course
is
not
final.
our
constitution
returning
to
first
principles
does
vest
in
the
congress
the
power
to
lay
taxes
and
appropriate
moneys.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
the
proposal
becomes
final
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
that
is
not
our
position.
the
proposal
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
no,
it
is
our
position
that
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
it's
our
position
that
we
would
not
be
obliged
to
file
a
statement.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
for
the
budget.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
for
the
budget.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
that's
our
position.
if
the
budget
for
example
appropriates
money
to
build
three
dams,
12
nuclear
power
stations,
the
action
would
have
to
be
considered.
the
action
would
have
to
be
considered
at
the
time
it
was
taken.
the
major
federal
action
to
be
considered
is
that
underlying
decision,
that
implementation,
that
spending
of
the
money.
at
that
time
we
acknowledge
that
there
might
well
be
required
an
environmental
impact
statement.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
the
proposal
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
the
statute
states
that
a
proposal
for
a
major
federal
action,
a
proposal
for
rule
making
for
example.
that
does
have
a
significant
impact.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
when
the
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
when
the
secretary
of
interior
proposes
and
let's
suppose
it
is
a
proposal
to
build
a
dam,
a
piece
of
substantive
legislation
seeking
the
authorization
to
build
the
dam.
that
proposal
could
be
a
proposal
for
legislation
which
would
significantly
affect
the
human
environment.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
when
the
secretary
of
interior
has
formulated,
has
before
him
a
proposal.
and
before
he
finalizes
that
proposal
there
may
be
at
that
point
the
requirement
of
an
environmental
impact
statement.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
that
will
be
a
proposal
for
legislation.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
interior
had
a
final
plan
before
him,
a
final
proposal.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
perhaps
alternatives.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
if
they
are
proposals
for
legislation,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
if
in
fact
they
will
be
proposed
by
--
yes,
yes
i
think
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
certainly
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
that
is
our
position
and
that
goes
to
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
traditional
intervention
in
a
process
where
congress
has
before
it
the
means
as
it
always
has
to
require
the
information
that
it
needs
to
make
its
decisions.
and
also
raises
the
question
of
whether
in
fact
the
imposition
of
an
environmental
impact
statement
requirement
at
this
stage
might
interfere
with
the
ability
of
congress
to
obtain
the
information,
the
candid
views,
the
frank
opinion
of
the
members
of
the
executive
branch
who
are
appearing
before
an
appropriation
subcommittee
to
respond
to
questions,
because
not
all
proposals
for
federal
funding
come
from
the
executive
branch.
in
fact,
many
are
interjected
just
at
that
stage,
the
subcommittee,
the
appropriations
subcommittee
with
the
idea,
with
the
constituent,
with
the
interest
group,
with
the
proposal
that
appears
before
the
committee
makes
that
proposal
beyond
the
president's
budget.
and
there
again,
the
congress
will
be
considering
that
proposal
and
will
be
seeking
the
advice
and
opinions
of
the
executive
branch,
the
department
of
interior.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
it's
our
position
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
no.
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
this
act
does
not
apply
to
the
budget
process.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
that
congress
did
not
intend
it
to
apply
--
mr.
john
m.
harmon
that
is
our
position
exactly.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
congress
did
not
say
that
and
there
is
nothing,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
considered
this
act
is
applying
to
the
budget
process.
furthermore,
is
inconceivable
to
imagine
that
congress
aware
of
the
significant
disruptive
impact
that
such
a
requirement
would
have
on
the
executive
and
congressional
budget
process
would
have
imposed
this
requirement
without
discussion.
indeed
congress
--
when
congress
seeks
information
from
--
seeks
additional
budget
information
it
is
traditionally
done
so
by
amending
the
budget
and
accounting
act.
it
is
done
in
1950,
1958
and
as
recently
as
1974
after
the
passage
--
after
the
passage
of
nepa.
again,
with
those
amendments,
congressional
budget
act
of
1974
had
no
mention
of
an
environmental
impact
statement.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
our
position
is
that
all
budget
--
all
budgetary
items
that
the
budget
process
is
not
covered
and
is
not
subject
to
the
environment
impact
statement
requirements.
our
third
argument
is
response
to
contention
by
respondents
that
there
is
an
alternative
basis
for
upholding
the
decision
of
the
court
below
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
they
argue
that
the
budget
estimates
are
not
only
proposals
for
legislation,
but
they
are
also
proposals
for
major
federal
action.
their
argument
is
that
at
the
time
an
agency
puts
together
its
proposed
proposal,
its
estimates,
its
budget
estimates
that
at
that
time
it
is
making
a
decision
a
proposal
for
all
the
major
--
all
of
the
actions,
all
of
the
federal
actions
that
will
be
funded
by
that
appropriation.
the
district
court
agreed
with
that
proposition.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
lead
to
the
absurd
result
that
every
budget
estimate
--
every
budget
estimate
would
require
an
environmental
impact
statement.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
your
honor,
it's
our
submission
that
that
logic
--
that
the
logic
of
that
position
is
necessarily
that
with
the
--
with
all
of
the
actions
that
are
funded
by
each
budget
appropriation
that
in
fact
it
would
apply
practically
to
all
agencies
and
all
budget
proposals.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
this
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
m.
harmon
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
counsel's
point
attempt
to
describe
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
nepa
requirement,
i
would
simply
like
to
point
out
that
the
congress
which
passed
nepa
has
for
10
years
received
and
acted
upon
budget
proposals
from
the
president
without
the
preparation
of
environmental
impact
statements
by
the
agencies
making
their
individual
proposals.
i
make
this
point
simply
to
underline
that
this
illustrates
a
common
understanding
of
both
congress
and
the
executive
branch
as
to
the
inapplicability
of
nepa
to
the
budget
process.
thank
you.
