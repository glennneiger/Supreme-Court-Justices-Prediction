justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
legislature
must
have
specifically
intended
to
harm
women
before
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
any
protection
case
then
if
you
get
in
the
court
and
you
make
a
record
and
show
that
this
supposedly
and
facially
neutral
statute
has
disproportionate
impact,
you
are
then
telling
a
legislature
that
it
has
an
impact
and
as
the
legislature
at
least
didn’t
effect,
it’s
automatically
foreseeable
impact
and
you
would
always
get
your
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
do
you
rely
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
my
example
the
judge
say
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
now
we’ve
made
these
findings
and
if
you
want
me
to
say
this
is
inevitable,
it
is
because
that’s
is
what
the
fact
show,
you
will
always
get
your
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
we’re
looking
forward,
he
says
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
looking
for
damages
i
want
to
get
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
will
always
will
be
for
foreseeable
consequences,
will
always
be
enough
then
as
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ward,
right
on
this
point,
98%
of
the
veterans
are
male
i
guess
--
justice
byron
r.
white
2%
are
women.
now
there
all
sorts
of
veterans
preferences.
gi
bill
of
rights
for
schooling
and
loans
and
all
of
the
rest
of
them
and
every
one
of
those
preferences,
the
legislature
must
have
known
the
98%
of
the
beneficiary
of
the
preference
would
be
male.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
reasoning
would
apply
equally
to
those
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
discrimination,
you’re
drawing
distinction
between
burdens
and
benefit.
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
constitutional
to
discriminate
by
giving
one
class
benefits
and
whereas
it’s,
that’s
okay
but
it’s
bad
if
you
burden
a
clause,
is
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
case
that
has
suggested
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
pursue
that
argument,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
an
even
stronger
case
against
the
federal
statute
to
discriminate
because
there
is
a
history
in
the
military
of
discriminating
between
men
and
women.
so
this
clearly
would
validate
all
the
federal
veterans’
preferences
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yeah,
this
makes
a
pretty
persuasive
argument
that
they
weren’t
very
finely
tailored.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
i
am
talking
about
the
federal
ones.
you
discussed
those
in
your
brief,
in
the
military
and
quite
precisely
show
they
were
not
finely
tailored.
justice
byron
r.
white
male
and
female.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
made
two
points
that
saying
that
why
forcibility
is
one,
you
say
difference
between
inevitability
and
forcibility
and
secondly
you
say
if
the
governing
body
has
a
history
of
treating
males
and
females
differently,
you
look
especially
closely
at
it.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
both
of
those
arguments
would
condemn
all
the
federal
veterans
preference
legislation.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
that
isn’t
the
approach
the
district
court
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
the
answer
is
no,
it
was
not
the
approach.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn’t
the
way
they
arrived
at
their
intent.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
excluded
class
is
not
just
women.
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
uniquely
invidious
on
the
non-veteran
male.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
economic
impact
is
the
same
on
the
non-veteran
male.
