justice
potter
stewart
is
this
exclusively
an
equal
protection
case?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
it’s
not,
no
reliance
is
placed
upon
the
due
process
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
been
argued
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
reported.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
there
is
no
claim
that
--
assumed
there
were
an
equal
number
of
males
and
females
or
veterans
and
non-veterans,
there’s
no
claim
that
the
discrimination
in
favor
of
veterans
and
against
non-veterans
is
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
or
violating
the
equal
protection
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
well
and
discriminates
against
females.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
classified
official
service.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
does
massachusetts
have
the
same
veteran’s
preference
with
respect
to
each?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
service?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
now
surviving
spouses
and
widows
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
surviving
widows
or
mothers
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
no
longer
is?
justice
potter
stewart
but
general
kiley
you
are
not
seriously
contending
are
you
that
this
veterans'
preference
doesn’t
have
an
extremely
discriminatory
impact
on
women,
98%
or
some
such
percentage
of
all
of
veterans'
in
massachusetts
are
males,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
classification?
justice
potter
stewart
why
should
that
be
with
the
veteran’s
preference?
justice
potter
stewart
well
why
is
it
with
the
veteran’s
preference?
justice
potter
stewart
that
also
be
a
truism
that
a
lot
of
women
don’t
even
bother
taking
the
test
because
they
are
not
veterans
and
they
know
they
can’t
overcome
the
great
big
handicap.
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
on
exhibit
7,
do
you
happen
to
know?
justice
potter
stewart
no
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
it,
page
132
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
average
of
veteran
non-disabled
has
the
same
argument
to
make
as
you
are
making
now
with
respect
to
disabled
veterans?
justice
potter
stewart
under
washington
against
davis
does
the,
intentional
or
deliberate
or
knowing
discrimination
against
a
particular
group,
in
this
case
women
have
to
be
a
discrimination
against
that
group
as
women,
an
intention
to
discriminate
against
women
or
what
if
it
simply
as
it
appears
on
the
face
of
this
statute,
an
intention
to
discriminate
against
non-veterans
with
knowledge
that
many
more
women
are
non-veterans
than
men.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
discrimination
against
non-veterans
which
is
clearly
is
on
its
face.
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
knowledge
that
--
there
are
many
more
non-veterans
who
are
women
than
there
are
men
who
are
non-veteran
is
not
enough.
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
asking
about
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
washington
against
davis
requires
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
adds
up
just
to
knowledge.
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
history
alone
is
enough
to
condemn
any
law
that
has
any
sort
of
a
discriminatory
impact
against
women
and
if
history
alone
is
enough
to
show
intent,
well
then
any
law
passed
by
any
state
would
be
constitutionally
invalid
because
up
until
fairly,
well
along
in
this
century
no
state
allowed
women
to
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
that
definition
of
veteran
administrators?
justice
potter
stewart
including
periods
when
weren’t
even
--
when
there
were
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
military
activity.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
are
not,
as
i
understand
it
at
least
attacking
the
veteran’s
preference
as
such.
you
are
not
--
your
claim
on
behalf
of
your
client
isn’t
that
she
is
a
non-veteran,
but
rather
that
she
is
woman.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
which
you
are
not
claiming
any
such
claim
in
this
case.
