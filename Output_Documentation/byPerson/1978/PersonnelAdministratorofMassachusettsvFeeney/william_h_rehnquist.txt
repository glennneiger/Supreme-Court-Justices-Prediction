h.

do
you
refer
to
the
district
court’s
opinion,
you
really
have
to
take
judge
campbell’s
opinion,
judge
tauro’s
opinion
together,
don’t
you
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kiley,
in
reading
the
massachusetts
statute
at
least
as
it’s
described
in
the
district
court
opinion
section
23
as
i
see,
it
just
refers
to
other
veterans
in
order
there
are
composite
scores
after
disabled
veterans.
is
that
a
separate
statutory
provision
that
provides
they
must
have
the
veterans
in
time
of
war?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that’s
set
forth
in
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don’t
read
judge
campbell’s
opinion
to
find
or
make
a
finding
of
discriminatory
intent.
i
read
judge
toro’s
opinion
to
find
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
read
you
from
page
19
a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
where
he
says
about
the
middle
of
page
to
be
sure
the
legislature
did
not
wish
to
hire
women,
but
the
cutting
off
of
women’s
opportunity
was
an
inevitable
concomitant
of
the
chosen
scheme,
as
inevitable
as
the
proposition
that
if
tails
is
up
heads
must
be
down.
where
a
law’s
consequences
are
that
inevitable
can
they
meaningfully
be
described
as
unintended?
doubtless
the
impact
on
women,
if
considered
at
all
was
regarded
and
acceptable
“cost”
of
aiding
veterans.
i
would
read
that
simply
as
saying
that
the,
where
the
foreseeable
consequences
are
that
obvious,
they
won't
save
a
statute
even
though
the
intent
was
not
there
to
discriminate
between
men
and
women.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wouldn’t
suggest
that
a
court
reviewing
a
statute
of
this
couldn’t
find
as
a
fact
from
inevitable
consequences
that
there
was
in
fact
discriminatory
intent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ward,
is
there
anyway
under
your
argument
where
massachusetts
could
retain
the
preference
for
disabled
veterans
and
nonetheless
give
it
up
for
non-disabled
veterans?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
asking
under
your
argument
whether
disabled
veteran
preference
could
survive,
is
your
answer
yes
or
no?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that’s
just
foreseeable
consequences.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
you
say
it
runs
with
the
explicit
distinction.
do
you
think
that
the
massachusetts
legislature
when
passed
its
veterans
preference
act
thought
this
will
be
another
good
way
to
keep
women
in
their
place
or
do
you
think
it
thought
we
want
to
do
some
for
the
people
who
have
been
veterans.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
talking
about
the
veterans
preference
act,
was
that
passed
in
19th
century?
