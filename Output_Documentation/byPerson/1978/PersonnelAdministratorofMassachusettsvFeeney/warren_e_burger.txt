we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
personnel
administrator
of
massachusetts
against
feeney.
mr.
kiley,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
massachusetts
statute
have
a
disproportionate
effect
on
over
men
than
on
younger
men?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
people
over
40
roughly
at
that
cut
off
were
less
likely
to
be
in
the
military
in
the
world
war
ii
or
somewhere
in
the
world
war
i.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
i
didn’t
make
my
question
very
clear.
as
it
stands,
the
argument
is
that
it
has
a
disproportionate
effect
upon
women
because
women
generally
weren’t
in
the
military
service,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
it
also
true
that,
let’s
move
it
up
to
age
50;
that
men
over
age
50
generally
were
not
in
military
servicing
combat.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
probably
talking
in
terms
of
numbers,
how
many
men,
what
percentage
of
the
armed
forces
in
world
war
ii,
were
over
50
years
of
age
unless
they
were
colonels
or
generals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
kiley.
mr.
ward.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
they
get
the
job?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
number
one
person
get
the
job?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
number
three
is
a
non
veteran,
may
he
be
picked?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
also
discriminatory
to
bar
women
in
combat
and
then
they
combat
service
basis
of
the
preference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
women
permitted
in
combat
service
now
under
the
existing
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ward
would
it
be
foreseeable
that
this
act
would
exclude
a
great
many
handicapped
disabled
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
also
as
i
suggested
to
your
colleague
it
would
certainly
exclude
foreseeably
most
of
the
people
over
age
45
or
50.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
consequence
of
this
in
terms
of
the
impact
is
not
limited
to
women,
it
hits
great
many
categories
of
people
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
all
disabled,
handicap
people,
all
not
most.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
category
or
group
against
whom
discrimination
is
asserted
is
a
small
group
or
a
large
group?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
