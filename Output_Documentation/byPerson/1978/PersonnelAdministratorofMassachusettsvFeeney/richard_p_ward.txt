mr.
richard
p.
ward
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
richard
ward
and
i
represent
the
appellee
helen
b.
feeney.
before
turning
to
the
difficult
legal
questions
presented
by
this
case,
whether
the
adverse
and
disastrous
impact
upon
women
is
in
fact
a
deliberate
discrimination
sufficient
so
that
this
court
should
pay
perhaps
somewhat
less
deference
to
legislative
judgments
and
then
applying
that
standard
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
profit
objectives
are
in
fact
substantially
well
served
by
massachusetts
choice
of
an
absolute
and
permanent
form
of
preference.
in
light
of
the
commonwealth
argument,
it
is
important
to
understand
exactly
how
this
absolute
preference
system
works.
and
to
understand
the
significant
systematic
adverse
impact
on
women
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
commonwealth
has
carefully
enough
demonstrated
or
indeed
admitted
what
that
impact
is.
most
of
brother
kiley’s
argument
rests
on
the
fact
that
42%
of
the
persons
over
a
10-year
period
who
obtain
jobs
were
female.
that
entirely
misses
the
thrust
of
this
action,
the
thrust
of
helen
feeney’s
case
and
indeed
the
basis
of
the
court’s
decision
below.
it
also
misses
the
admission
of
one
of
the
prime
defendants
in
the
case
the
director
of
civil
service
who
in
himself
stating
for
the
court
exactly
how
the
system
worked
especially
in
light
of
more
recent
changes
in
the
civil
service
system
whereby
now
they
have
what
are
called
banded
examinations
for
large
numbers
of
positions,
which
large
number
of
persons
apply
including
large
numbers
of
veterans
who
are
principally
male
and
large
numbers
of
non-veterans
for
upper
level
or
positions
of
significance
who
are
principally
female.
the
director
of
civil
service
in
his
testimony
to
the
court
below
in
the
form
of
affidavit
said
that
the
system
would
work
as
follows.
women
will
continue
to
be
employed
primarily
in
the
relatively
low
paying
entry
level
clerical
positions
for
which
men
traditionally
do
not
apply,
because
it
goes
on
to
say
however
for
the
relatively
high
paying
civil
service
positions
such
as
programmers,
planners,
physiologists,
administrative
assistants,
head
administrative
assistants
et
cetera.
the
continued
use
of
the
veterans
preference
statute
will
result
in
few
if
any
female
eligibles
being
considered
and
appointed
to
such
positions.
that
it
is
not
a
true
demonstration
of
the
effect
upon
women
simply
to
point
to
the
fact
that
42%
of
all
the
persons
hired
were
female,
they
are
principally
being
hired
as
secretaries
in
the
stereotypic
jobs
for
which
massachusetts
for
75
years
has
allowed
women
to
obtain
and
allowed
women
to
obtain
in
a
more
rigorous
explicit
sex
distinctions
in
terms
of
the
practice
for
75
years
of
recruiting
on
the
basis
of
sex
for
female
jobs
and
male
jobs.
this
is
the
thrust
of
the
action
and
one
must
understand
exactly
how
this
veterans
preference
system
works.
although
referred
to
below
is
an
absolute
preference
and
indeed
this
court
is
faced
with
the
most
extreme
form
of
preference.
what
is
generally
known
as
absolute
preference?
commonwealth
of
course
refers
to
adhere
as
a
positional
preference,
it
doesn’t
sound
so
bad
but
it
is
an
absolute
preference
in
a
following
sense.
what
it
does?
it
places
ahead
on
an
eligible
list,
an
eligible
list
determines
who
will
be
certified
and
considered
for
jobs
and
the
persons
at
the
top
of
eligible
list,
those
are
the
persons
who
get
the
job,
because
it
stipulate
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
yes,
your
honor
it
is
been
stipulated
by
the
commonwealth
in
a
agreed
statement
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
not
necessarily,
three
names
are
certified
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
yes,
your
honor
if
he
is
certified.
the
problem
with
this
system
is
there
are
so
many
veterans
applying
for
jobs
of
significance.
the
veterans
all
go
to
the
top
of
the
list
above
all
non-veterans
regardless
of
scores.
so
it’s
absolute
in
that
sense
and
that’s
the
sense
in
which
it
distinguishes
this
form
of
preference
from
a
point
preference
which
only
gives
veterans
somehow
but
moves
them
up
somewhat
relatively,
but
doesn’t
moves
them
as
a
group
to
the
top
of
the
list.
essentially,
the
way
it
works
and
i
think
the
one
of
the
best
list
to
look
at
is
in
exhibit
7,
which
is
the
administrative
assistants
list
and
that’s
one
of
the
banded
examinations
for
which
43
administrative
assistant
positions
were
available.
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
p.
ward
not
on
the
top
of
my
head,
your
honor
i
believe
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
it
can
be
found.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
yes
your
honor.
there
approximately
176
people
who
are
found
eligible,
23%
of
the
eligible’s
on
that
administrative
assistant
list
that
is
exhibit
7
were
females.
as
a
result
of
application
of
the
preference
however
in
terms
of
the
top
43
positions
on
that
list
to
be
certified
--
considered
for
these
43
jobs,
no
females
were
on
the
eligible
list.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
no
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
so.
some
of
them
may
if
the
court
at
some
point
articulate
the
standard
for
persons
who
are
handicap.
some
male
non-veterans
through
no
fault
of
their
own
are
also
discriminated
against.
but
what
sets
apart
the
discrimination
against
women
in
this
case
from
the
discrimination
against
not
non-veteran
males
is
the
very
basis
upon
which
we
suggest
that
this
should
be
considered
a
deliberate
discrimination
against
females.
and
that’s
principally
because
of
the
fact
that
the
veteran
classification
amounts
to
a
condition
preceding
to
being
able
to
obtain
a
job
and
it
necessarily
incorporates
by
reference.
the
decades
of
discrimination
against
women
in
terms
by
the
military,
in
terms
of
entry
into
the
military
whole
categories
of
women
were
not
allowed
into
the
service
and
whether
that
is
right
or
wrong,
or
lawful
or
unlawful
as
far
as
the
military
is
concerned,
nonetheless
it
was
a
discrimination.
whole
categories
of
women,
women
who
happened
to
be
married
were
not
allowed
in
the
service,
women
who
had
minor
children,
the
female
parent
not
allowed
in
the
service.
women
had
to
wait
until
age
21
otherwise
they
needed
parental
consent.
males
over
the
age
of
18
did
not
need
parental
consent.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
i
believe
it
would
be
your
honor
in
the
following
sense,
if
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
generally
not
your
honor,
but
the
discrimination
of
course
was
far
more
severe
than
that
resulting
in
really
the
systematic
exclusion
of
women
from
the
military
and
the
decision
that’s
at
stake
is
the
judgment
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
how
will
it
run,
it’s
in
public
employment
system
and
what
it’s
done,
whether
there
is
justification
for
that
discrimination
against
the
military
has
taken
all
those
restrictions
by
making
the
veteran
classification
as
the
court
found
below,
a
replacement
for
testing
as
to
determining
factor
as
to
who
appears
on
the
top
of
the
list.
massachusetts
has
incorporated
wholesale
all
these
entry
level
restrictions
to
the
military
into
its
public
employment
system
and
is
that
judgment
for
which
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
we
submit
should
be
held
responsible.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
your
honor
in
terms
of
the
record
presented
to
the
court
below,
for
example,
exhibit
12,
one
would
see
that
the
number
of
disabled
veterans
that
apply
are
relatively
minor
in
number
as
to
the
number
of
disabled
veterans
who
apply
and
are
eligible
is
relatively
minor
in
comparison
with
the
total
number
of
veterans.
as
a
result,
the
impact
indeed
would
be
much
less
severe
if
they
simply
had
a
preference
for
veterans.
whether
or
not
an
absolute
preference
for
disabled
veterans
would
indeed
still
have
the
inevitable
systematic
exclusionary
effect
on
women
which
leads
to
as
what
the
court
found
below,
the
near
blanket
exclusion
of
women
from
all
upper
level
jobs
of
interest
to
male.
we
don’t
know
on
this
record
but
we
think
there
might
well
be
a
distinction
that
would
be
a
lesser
form
of
preference.
what
the
court
is
faced
with
here
is
one
of
the
most
extreme
forms
in
terms
of,
as
the
court
below
set
a
broad
brush
approach.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
the
answer
is,
disabled
veteran
would
still
constitute
to
the
extent
it
produced
a
disproportion
an
impact
on
women
because
of
the
incorporation
of
the
military’s
discrimination.
there
would
be
still
be
an
intentional
discrimination
against
women
and
that
is
deliberate,
but
it
might
well
survive
the
heightened
level
of
scrutiny
accorded
by
this
court,
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
means
chosen
being
reasonably
tailored
to
disabled
veterans
who
perhaps
are
in
the
most
need
of
rehabilitation
or
some
readjustment
assistance
that
might
well
pass
the
so
called
middle
level
scrutiny
because
it’s
a
more
finely
tailored
means.
but
i
think
it
would
still
be
a
deliberate
discrimination,
your
honor
but
perhaps
might
pass
muster
under
the
substantial
relation
test.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
i
believe
your
honor
that
under
washington
versus
davis,
in
order
to
invoke
this
court
to
somewhat
heightened
level
of
scrutiny
we
have
to
show
that
the
discrimination
is
a
deliberate
one
against
women
and
we
believe
the
record
adequately
substantiates
that
fact.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
yes
it
is.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well
with
the
knowledge
of
the
--
that
may
well
be
enough
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
i
believe
that
is
enough
given
the
history
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
yes,
given
the
history
of
discrimination
by
the
military
against
the
entry
level
of
--
entry
of
women
into
the
military
and
given
the
commonwealth’s
wholesale
transfer
of
those
entry
level
requirements
by
making
the
veteran
classification,
the
condition
perceiving
to
being
able
to
obtain
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
it
adds
up
we
believe
to
knowledge
that
there
will
be
to
severe
disproportionate
impact
on
women.
yes,
your
honor
that
is
enough
we
believe
to
show
a
deliberate
discrimination.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
yes
your
honor
and
we
believe
that
it’s
not
just
foreseeable
as
the
court
below
indicated
it’s
somewhat
more
than
foreseeable,
it’s
inevitable
given
the
chosen
scheme.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well,
we
--
yes,
mr.
justice
white
and
that’s
the
problem
with
just
relying
solely
on
the
foreseeable
consequences
test.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
we
rely
on
two
other
principal
factors.
first
of
all
the
fact
that
we
make
a
distinction
between
foreseeability
and
inevitability;
we
don’t
believe
those
problems
of
the
foreseeability
test
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
okay,
that
maybe
in
terms
of
looking
after
the
fact,
at
the
facts
and
looking
back,
but
in
additional
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well
looking
for
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well,
that’s
true
too
your
honor.
we
believe
this
case
shows
a
deliberate
discrimination
against
women,
so
it
is
a
problem.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well
not
necessarily
every
foreseeable
consequence.
we
believe
that
you
have
to
analyze
as
the
court
has
suggested,
all
the
facts
and
circumstances.
and
this
is
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
we
don’t
think
so
your
honor
–
mr.
richard
p.
ward
in
that
merely
the
absence
of
a
benefit
not
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
yes
your
honor
and
we
think
here
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
under
some
circumstances,
we
believe
that
is
the
law
your
honor.
in
the
following
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well
the
distinction
in
terms
of
the
pregnancy
case
brought
by
the
court
in
terms
of
nashville
gas
versus
satty
--
statutory
but
the
court
did
suggest
that
you’re
dealings
are
different
type
of
problem
and
you
in
fact
burden
a
group
and
here
we
have
a
group
that
is
historically
been
burdened
in
the
employment
contract,
in
the
employment
context,
we
have
women,
women
constitute
two-thirds
of
the
nonveterans’
and
virtually
all
the
women
are
in
the
nonveteran
category
and
massachusetts
sets
up
a
preference
so
absolute
that
systematically
they
are
excluded
from
every
job
of
interest
for
males
and
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice’s
white’s
question
we
do
have
additional
evidence,
if
foreseeability
and
inevitability
is
not
enough
to
satisfy
this
court’s
view
of
when
is
enough
proof
shown
that
we
will
hold
the
state
responsible
because
of
the
deliberate
and
purposeful
discrimination.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
this
particular
classification
on
its
face
incorporates
essentially
by
reference
the
military’s
discrimination
but
more
than
that,
we
have
our
entire
legislative
history
and
examination
of
the
legislative
history
or
the
public
employment
system
in
massachusetts
shows
that
for
85
years
the
commonwealth
intended
to
expressly
--
to
treat
males
and
females
differently,
right
along
with
this
reason
for
having,
the
policy
of
having
an
absolute
preference
the
commonwealth
also
had
a
policy
of
separately
requisitioning
and
recruiting
on
the
basis
of
male
jobs
and
female
jobs
and
there’s
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
that
shows
this
exhibit
64
through
79,
if
you
want
it
to
be
in
a
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
we
think
not
your
honor,
again
one
might
find
that
all
the
veteran’s
preferences
constitute
some
deliberate
discrimination
against
women
but
they
might
be
tailored
finely
enough
to
their
purposes
that
they
would
pass
the
appropriate
level
of
scrutiny.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
not
in
this
case
your
honor,
this
is--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well,
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
oh,
certainly
in
terms
of
the
military
restrictions
are
not
very
well
tailored
and
that
leads
to
the
fact
that
this
statue
should
essentially
be
treated
as
an
explicit
distinction
between
males
and
females
in
terms
of
its
effect
of
excluding
women
from
public
service
jobs.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
they
would
then
not
necessarily
condemn
them
your
honor.
it
would
make
us
conclude
that
they
can
also
constitute
a
deliberate
discrimination
against
women,
but
as
the
amicus
plea
for
the
department
of
defense
showed
that
this
us
civil
service
commission
study
of
the
affect
upon
women
of
point
system
shows
that
it
has
a
much
less
significant
impact
on
women
and
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
this
statue
does
particularly
meets
its
goals,
when
you
bear
in
mind
this
statute
has
originally
was
passed
back
in
the
days,
in
19th
century
when
the
assumption
was
that
women
would
not
be
looking
for
upper
level
jobs,
and
when
you
look
at
the
specific
statues
and
you
see
the
requisitioning
policy--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
that’s
right
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
expect
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
shows
that
right
about
the
time
in
the
early,
the
end
of
the
19th
century
and
the
beginning
of
this
century
the
commonwealth
was
at
least
starting
to
realize
that
perhaps
some
women
could
run
those
stenographic
machines
and
that’s
why
they
carved
out
and
didn’t
apply
the
preference
and
they
tried
to
so
call
protect
women’s
jobs.
the
clear
history
of
this
civil
service
system
is
a
history
of
expressed
deliberate,
distinctions
between
male
jobs
and
female
jobs
and
running
along
with
that
history
was
the
decision
to
have
an
absolute
preference.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that’s
why
we
don’t
say
that
the
fact
that
this
statue
was
passed
in
the
19th
century
is
in
and
off
itself
enough
to
condemn
it.
we
add
that
specific
legislative
history,
the
administrative
history
to
the
fact
that
the
manner
of
using
this
preference,
incorporating
wholesale
the
military’s
discrimination,
renders
the
statute
essentially
one
which
explicitly
distinguishes
between
males
and
females
in
terms
of
who
in
fact
will
receive
jobs
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
that’s
the
way
the
statute
works.
it
works
as
if
you’d
incorporated
all
the
militaries
discrimination
in
terms
of
entry
level
into
the
military
right
into
your
public
employment
system.
this
runs
with
the
history
of
explicit
distinctions
between
the
sexes
for
75
years
in
terms
of
the
hiring
and
requisitioning
policy.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
okay,
your
honor
obviously
the
ultimate
purpose
was
to
drive
some
aid
or
help
in
some
way
to
veterans,
that
was
the
ultimate
purpose,
okay,
but
this
court
has
recognized
there
are
various
factors
that
determined
the
decision
and
constitute
motivating
factors
and
if
you
express
it
in
terms
of
a
desire
to
get
women
or
to
hire
women
we
all
shrink
back,
that’s
not
discrimination.
products
of
a
male
dominated
society
are
not
going
to
want
to
harm
women,
what
in
fact
happened
mr.
justice
rehnquist
back
there
in
the
19th
century
is
that
the
legislature
assumed
that
women
either
would
not
or
should
not
be
interested
in
upper
level
jobs.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
it
was
passed
in
first
one
in
1884,
and
the
one
that
parallels
the
one
we
have
now
was
passed
in
1896
and
when
they
passed
it
mr.
justice
rehnquist
what
they
did
was
they
basically
said
this
preference
will
not
apply
to
jobs
especially
calling
for
women.
the
statute
on
their
face
throughout
the
years,
shows
expressly
a
desire
to
distinguish
between
men
and
women
because
women’s
job
could
be
predicted.
again
based
on
the
stereotype
that
women
should
not
or
would
not
be
looking
for
upper
level
jobs,
that's
where
if
you
going
get
into
subjective
motivation,
this
history
literally
leaps
out
at
you
and
shows
that
massachusetts
intended
and
is
continued
to
intend
to
deal
differently
with
males
and
females
under
the
stereotype
that
there
are
women’s
jobs
and
there
are
males
jobs.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
district
court
relied
basically
mr.
justice
white
on
the
objective
evidence.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well,
they’ve
certainly,
we’re
aware
of
it,
it
was
argued
and
in
a
footnote
in
the
last
decision
they
show
that
at
least
suggested--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
yes
it
would
your
honor,
because
they
again
through
no
fault
of
their
own
were
not
allowed
into
the
military
and
it
would
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
again
looking
at
the
fact
that’s
mostly
young
persons
that
go
in,
in
one
sense
it
would
in
terms
of
the
persons
who
obtain
a
preference
in
terms
of
what
age
they
were
when
it
was
most
likely
that
they
would
go
into
the
service.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
but
women
are
the
more
severely
affected
because
virtually
all
women
are
nonveterans,
nonveteran
the
inferior
classification--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
well,
that’s
true
but
two-thirds
of
the
nonveterans
your
honor
are
women
and
virtually
all
women
are
nonveterans.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
no
your
honor,
but
the
group
is
asserting,
mrs.
feeney
happens
to
be
member
of
a
class
of
women
and
that’s
the
one
that’s
before
the
court.
the
handicap
may
well
have
an
equally
compelling
argument
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
deal
here
in
fact
with
a
case
of
a
woman
and
we
are
looking
at
the
standards
applied
by
this
court.
so
to
summarize
basically
we
would
feel
that
the
wholesale
incorporation
of
the
military’s
discrimination
against
women
into
the
public
employment
system
combined
with
the
inevitability
of
the
exclusionary
effect
virtually
total.
judge
campbell
below
said
it
constitutes
a
near
blanket
exclusion
of
women
from
the
whole
segment,
a
major
segment
of
employment
and
it
goes
a
long
way
towards
making
upper
level
public
employment
massachusetts
a
male
preserve,
based
on
those
two
objective
factors
and
the
legislative
history,
we
think
clearly
that
this
is
at
least
a
deliberate
and
purposeful
discrimination
against
women
and
when
we
turn
now
to
the
question
of
what
appropriate
standard
and
we
look
to
the
standard
that
has
been
applied
by
this
court
in
cases
involving
discrimination
against
women,
we
see
that
the
court
asked
whether
or
not
the
classification
serves
an
important
governmental
objective
and
whether
or
not
the
means
chosen
to
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
those
objectives.
and
the
one
question
that
commonwealth
could
not
answer
when
asked
below
and
the
one
question
that
the
commonwealth
does
not
address
itself
to
here
is
why
have
such
an
extreme
form
of
preference
and
absolute
and
permanent
one,
one
that
lasts
throughout
a
veteran’s
lifetime
and
gives
women
virtually
no
chance,
no
matter
how
much
ability
is
shown
by
an
individual
woman,
does
not
give
any
of
those
women
a
chance
for
any
of
these
upper
level
jobs.
and
that’s
the
question
that
we
have
to
ask
ourselves.
this
is
not
a
case
of
any
preference
simply
a
head
start,
but
we
are
challenging
this
form,
this
extreme
form
of
preference
in
which
only
a
handful
of
states
have
a
similar
type
of
preference.
most
states
of
course
having
the
more
modest
point
preference
and
when
you
look
at
the
profit
goals
offered
by
the
state,
we
see
that
this
particular
form
of
preference
does
not
well
serve
those
goals.
first,
we
hear
from
the
attorney
general
from
the
commonwealth
in
their
brief,
a
lot
of
solicitude
about
readjustment
back
to
civilian
life,
a
lot
of
solicitude
for
the
recently
discharged
veteran.
when
we
look
at
absolute
and
permanent
form
of
preference
and
we
ask
what
does
it
do
for
the
recently
discharged
veteran?
and
again
if
we
look
at
exhibit
seven
the
administrative
assistance
list,
we
see
that
it
does
very
little
for
the
discharged
veterans.
in
fact
of
the
96
veterans
on
the
two
major
lists,
exhibits
seven
and
nine,
the
administrative
assistants
list
and
the
other
longer
list,
the
counsel
list,
we
find
that
40
of
the
veterans
were
discharged
in
the
1940s,
20
in
the
1950s,
and
15
in
the
1960s.
only
three
of
the
top
25
on
the
eligible
list
for
administrative
assistance
had
been
discharged
within
five
years
of
service
because
it’s
such
an
extreme
preference,
so
broad,
a
permanent
preference,
it
tends
in
fact
to
reward
or
to
give
benefit
to
the
persons
who
are
longest
out
of
the
service.
it
also
gives
them
additional
benefit
in
terms
if
their
rank
relatively
higher
within
that
preference
category
than
their
most
recently
discharged
veteran,
and
that
the
scores
are
also
a
function
of
how
much
training
and
experience
you
have.
so
the
longer
you're
out
of
the
service
the
higher
score
you’ll
have.
on
the
(inaudible)
list
the
average
year
of
discharge
was
1956,
a
full
19
years
before
the
establishment
of
list.
so
when
we
look
at
this
extreme
form
of
preference
we
see
that
it
does
not
really
well
serve
the
veteran
most
in
need
of
some
readjustment
assistance.
and
as
the
commonwealth
has
pointed
out
it’s
also
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
veterans
can’t
pass
the
test.
these
are
the
persons
logically
are
most
in
need
of
some
readjustments.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
it
is
a
very
broad
your
honor,
it
includes
anyone
that
served
during
the
period
between
1940
and
1975
for
most
of
that
period
simply
a
minimum
of
90
days
and
during
about
nine
of
those
years
a
period
of
about
180
days.
so
it’s
extremely
broad.
in
terms
of
the
other
rationales--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
that’s
is
right
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
it
sweeps
broadly,
again
it’s
an
extreme
form
of
preference
not
well
tailored
to
any
of
the
profit
goals.
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
profit
goal
of
encouraging
enlistment
if
that’s
particularly
important
interest
to
a
state
as
served
at
all,
no
factual
rationale.
and
in
terms
of
the
broadly
stated
reward
rationale
we
simply
with
regard
to
that,
that’s
a
broad
statement
of
a
goal.
there
has
to
be
some
limit
when
you
say
that
your
goal
is
simply
to
reward
veterans.
for
example
the
state
couldn’t
really
say
that
only
veterans
could
practice
law
in
this
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
or
only
the
children
are
veterans,
there
has
to
be
some
limit
and
we
look
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
and
the
effect
on
women
is
invidious
here.
it
violates
the
basic
concept
of
our
system
that
burden
should
be
imposed
based
on
some
wrong
doing
or
individual
responsibility
or
as
this
court
recognized
in
frontiero,
what
the
affect
of
this
is
by
excluding
women
as
a
class.
it
invidiously
relegates
the
entire
class
of
females.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
not
equally
given
the
history
of
discrimination
against
women
particularly
on
--
mr.
richard
p.
ward
it
works
the
same
on
other
non-veterans.
mr.
richard
p.
ward
i
am
making
the
claim
for
helen
feeney
and
her
class
of
females,
who
as
this
court
has
recognized
has
suffered
a
long
history
of
discrimination
and
that
the
job
market
has
been
particularly
inhospitable
to
women
seeking
any
but
the
lowest
jobs.
that’s
what
distinguishes
the
women
from
the
men,
the
men
have
not
been
invidiously
discriminated
against
an
employment
and
here
massachusetts
perpetuates
the
very
stereotypes
that
constituted
the
premise
upon
which
the
statute
was
passed.
women
should
be
in
women
jobs,
men
should
be
in
men’s
jobs.
and
while
they
have
removed
some
of
the
more
expressed
discrimination,
the
effect
of
this
statute
and
its
original
design
and
premise
produces
the
exact
same
result.
women
cannot
obtain
jobs
of
interest
to
men
and
they
are
necessarily
perpetuating
the
stereotype
as
to
what
jobs
males
should
obtain
and
what
jobs
females
should
obtain
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
we
believe
that
it
goes
much
too
far
and
it
constitutes
invidious
discrimination
and
we
ask
the
court
to
strike
it
down.
thank
you
very
much.
