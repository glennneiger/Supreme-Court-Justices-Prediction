mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
r.
kiley.
i’m
the
first
assistant
attorney
general
at
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
with
me
at
counsel
table
a
is
attorney
general
francis
x.
bellotti.
we
appear
today
in
defense
of
the
commonwealth’s
veterans
preference
statute.
the
statute
which
was
quantified
when
challenged
is
massachusetts
general
laws
chapter
31,
section
23
and
which
is
set
forth
in
the
form
which
it
existed
at
that
time
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
in
the
essence,
it
is
a
positional
veteran’s
preference
statute,
which
places
veterans
who
qualify
for
civil
service
jobs
by
passing
examinations.
at
the
top
of
civil
service
lists
of
those
eligible
for
appointment
to
jobs.
this
positional
preference
statute
is
challenged
by
helen
b.
feeney,
a
non-veteran
female
who
alleges
that
the
application
of
the
statute
denies
her
and
people
of
gender,
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
thrust
of
her
complaint
is
that
few
women
are
veterans
and
that
application
of
the
veteran’s
preference
naturally
excludes
women
from
civil
service
jobs.
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
appeal
from
a
divided
three
judge
panel
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts.
that
court
first
decided
this
case
in
march
of
1976
invalidating
the
state
statute
largely
on
the
basis
of
its
impact
on
women.
on
our
original
appeal,
you
remanded
the
cause
to
the
district
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
washington
and
davis.
the
case
which
we
submit
repudiated
the
impact
analysis
used
by
the
court
below.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
it
is
exclusively
an
equal
protection
case
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
could
not
be
title
vii
seven
case,
under
title
vii
veteran’s
preference
statutes
are
explicitly
excluded.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
well,
it
is
an
equal
protection
clause
case
as
it
is
been
decided
i
think.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
three
judge
panel
reconsidered
this
case
on
the
original
record
and
adhered
to
its
original
ruling,
essentially
agreeing
with
mrs.
feeney’s
basic
contention
that
the
veterans
preference
statute
is
applied
in
massachusetts
invidiously
discriminates
against
women
in
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
we
obliviously
disagree
with
that
conclusion,
but
we
do
not
disagree
with
everything
that
the
district
court
had
to
say
in
this
case.
in
the
areas
of
agreement
are
important
to
emphasis
of
the
outset
of
the
argument
because
they
serve
to
narrow
our
focus.
first,
nobody
seems
to
contend
that
the
concept
of
a
civil
service
hiring
preference
for
veterans
is
itself
unconstitutional.
each
of
the
judges
who
considered
this
case,
the
parties
before
this
court
and
amicus
curii,
all
seem
to
staff
from
the
premise
the
veteran’s
hiring
preferences
are
constitutional
and
that
they
are
further
important
societal
objectives.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
and
those
who
challenge
the
concept
of
veteran’s
preference,
or
those
who
challenge
this
preference
do
not
challenge
it
but
because
of
the
concept
or
because
they
believe
this
statute
goes
too
far.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
the
argue
--
the
essence
of
the
district
court’s
opinion
is
that
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
about
the
statute
even
though
fewer
women
benefit,
but
that
this
particular
statute
goes
too
far.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think,
i
frankly
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
i
have
to
take
both
of
their
opinions
in
both
of
the
cases
because
of
the
way
this
particular
case
is,
happens
to
come
before
the
court.
to
the
extent
that
the
disagreement
on
the
form
of
the
particular
statute
maybe
appropriately
framed
in
the
judicial
as
opposed
to
legislative
form,
its
resolution
before
this
court
may
well
turn
on
the
operation
of
the
massachusetts
civil
service
system
and
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
if
i
accomplish
nothing
else
today
i
hope
to
focus
the
court’s
attention
on
the
operation
of
the
statute
and
on
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
second
statement
of
the
district
court’s
opinions
with
which
we
wholeheartedly
concur,
is
the
conclusion
of
the
massachusetts
veterans
preference
was
not
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
disqualifying
women
from
receiving
civil
service
position
and
it’s
concession
that
the
state’s
prime
objective
of
aiding
those
who
served
our
country
in
time
of
war
is
rational
and
legitimate.
the
third
point
on
which
we
agree
with
the
lower
court
is
that
this
case
is
not
a
vehicle
for
an
evaluation
of
the
constitutionality
of
federal
investment
policies.
policies
which
the
plaintiff
mrs.
feeney’s
presumes
amount
to
a
(inaudible)
this
system
of
sex
discrimination
in
federal
military
service.
if
the
plaintiff
or
a
class
of
women
want
to
challenge
the
federal
investment
policies,
let
them
do
so
directly
and
not
collaterally
and
let
the
federal
government
have
the
opportunity
to
defend
its
own
statutes
and
regulations.
we
consent
to
you
today
not
with
the
federal
policies
themselves,
it’s
solely
with
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
massachusetts
veterans
preference.
and
the
application
and
the
answer
to
the
question
turns
lastly
according
to
the
plaintiffs
on
the
application,
operational
effects
of
the
statute.
before
any
analysis
of
this
case
must
begin
with
an
understanding
of
the
massachusetts
civil
service
system.
to
begin
with
all
state
jobs
are
not
covered
by
that
system,
40%
of
the
jobs
many
of
them
upper
level,
higher
paying
policy
making
positions,
the
kind
of
positions
this
court
discussed
in
elrod
v.
burns
are
not
covered
by
the
civil
service
system
at
all.
60%
of
the
jobs
are
and
they
fall
entirely
into
two
categories
of
jobs.
they
are
classified
labor
service
and
classified
official
service
and
mrs.
feeney’s
challenge
in
this
case
close
goes
only
to
or
at
least
her
evidence
in
this
case
was
only
to
the
official
classified
service,
one
of
the
two
components.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
classified
official
service,
i
tend
to
mix
up
my
adjectives.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
yes,
we
do
--
in
the
labor
service
there’s
not
the
same
examination
procedures
that
we
go
for
in
the
labor
section.
in
fact,
the
plaintiff
in
the
court
below
seem
to
have
narrowed
the
focus
even
further.
conceding
that
women
obtained
a
significant
proportion
of
the
jobs
in
the
category
of
classified
official
service
but
arguing
that
they’re
excluded
from
upper
level
higher
paying
jobs
whatever
they
may
be.
anyone
who
applies
for
a
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
in
that
service.
anyone
who
applies
for
a
permanent
position
in
that
or
any
service,
in
that
service
is
required
as
a
first
step
to
pass
an
qualifying
the
examination.
on
many
of
the
lists
that
we’ve
seen
before
us
in
the
record,
the
qualifying
examination
reach
out
significant
numbers
of
applicants.
those
who
do
pass
the
examination
are
placed
on
eligible
lists
but
veterans
who
do
not
pass
that
qualifying
examination
get
no
form
of
veteran’s
preference
whatsoever.
those
who
do
pass
are
placed
on
eligible
lists
and
the
personnel
administrator
of
the
commonwealth
applying
massachusetts
law
prepares
those
lists
by
listing
first
disabled
veterans,
then
veterans,
then
surviving
spouses
or
widows
and
finally
all
others
who
pass
within
each
group
in
accordance
with
their
respective
examination
scores.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
it
is
now
surviving
spouses
or
parents
at
the
time
of
original
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
widows
or
widowed
parents,
it
was
a
sex
specific
term
at
that
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
no
longer
is,
we
have
an
equal
rights
amendment
in
massachusetts,
with
its
passage
to
many
of
the
sex
specific
terms
it
typified
a
lot
of
legislations
in
the
state.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
the
massachusetts
statute
applies
to
the
massachusetts
veterans’
preference
statute.
it
is
not
durational
in
its
total.
it
applies
to
people
of
all
ages,
veterans
of
all
ages.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
the
statute
does
draw
lines
on
the
basis
of
the
time
of
one’s
service.
the
statute
is
a
war
time
preference
statute.
those
who
served
not
in
world
war
ii,
not
in
korea,
not
in
vietnam
and
are
in
the
civil
service
system
do
not
obtain
a
veteran’s
preference.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
in
the
time
of
war.
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
50
is
too
young,
perhaps
60
is
the
right
age.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
my
reference,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
is
to
the
age
of
individuals
now
and
the
preference
as
it
operates
now,
the
class
of
non-eligibles
for
the
veterans
preference
includes
approximately
a
million
males.
the
class
of
preference
eligibles
includes
about
800,000
males
and
about
16,000
females.
after
passing
an
examination,
one
waits
for
a
requisition
to
come
from
a
particular
appointing
authority
and
while
there
are
various
methods
of
certification
that
the
personnel
administrator
uses,
they
all
share
one
prime
characteristic
and
that
is
--
that
he
certifies
more
names
than
there
are
positions
to
be
filled.
moreover,
at
this
stage
of
the
process
at
least
now
in
massachusetts,
the
personnel
administrator
may
certify
a
number
of
minority
or
women
equal
to
the
number
of
individuals
who
would
be
certified
under
the
normal
process
if
he
first
makes
a
determination
that
there
has
been
discrimination
against
those
people
on
the
basis
of
race,
sex,
or
national
origin.
the
final
step
in
the
appointment
process
is
the
actual
hiring
and
is
made
by
an
appointing
authority
not
by
the
personnel
administrator.
it’s
important
to
emphasize
that
the
appointing
authority
need
not
appoint
those
who
appear
at
the
top
of
the
list.
certification
guarantee
is
consideration,
but
not
appointment,
and
an
appointing
authority
is
free
to
reach
past
the
individual
who
appears
at
the
top
of
the
list
and
hire
somebody
who
appears
beneath
him
or
her.
thus
a
veteran,
who
is
looking
at
the
civil
service
system
from
the
outside
faces
two
significant
barriers
to
appointment.
first,
he
has
to
pass
the
civil
service
examination
and
then
even
if
he
gets
to
the
top
of
the
list
he
may
not
be
hired
by
particular
appointing
authority.
it’s
that
system
that
helen
feeney
challenges.
as
i
stated
earlier
she
is
not
a
veteran
and
she
never
made
application
to
serve
in
the
military
although
in
world
war
ii
she
was
in
age
when
her
peers
--
her
contemporaries
in
terms
of
age
were
of
an
age
when
they
were
either
volunteering
a
faced
conscription.
in
fact,
helen
feeney’s
affidavit
tells
us
the
reason
that
she
did
not
enter
the
service
although
she
inquired
as
to
admission
practices
is
that
her
mother
didn’t
think
that
the
reputation
of
women
seek
in
the
military
at
the
time
was
good.
helen
feeney
turned
21
in
1943,
she
chose
not
to
apply
for
the
military
thereafter.
helen
feeney
has
an
expansive
employment
record,
spending
28
years
from
1948
to
1975.
the
early
years
of
that
service
were
all
private
sector
jobs
until
1963
she
went
exclusively
in
the
private
sector.
in
1962,
she
took
and
passed
her
first
open
competitive
civil
service
examination,
it’s
for
a
clerical
position.
and
in
1963,
she
was
appointed
to
the
clerical
position
in
the
massachusetts
civil
defense
agency.
she
held
that
clerical
position
for
approximately
four
years
at
which
time
she
took
and
passed
an
open
promotional
examination
and
became
the
agency’s
federal
funds
and
personnel
coordinator.
she
remained
in
that
position
for
approximately
eight
years
until
a
point
within
53
days
of
the
date
she
passed,
she
filed
at
this
particular
action,
on
that
date
the
civil
defense
agency
was
effectively
abolished
in
massachusetts.
in
addition
to
the
two
open
competitive
examinations,
which
she
took
regarding
the
civil
defense
agency,
helen
feeney
took
and
passed
approximately
seven
open
examinations
in
the
civil
service
system
in
the
ten
years
that
preceded
this
compliant.
for
one
reason
or
another,
she
was
never
appointed
to
any
of
the
positions
for
which
she
applied.
but
she
premises
her
case,
she
predicates
the
compliant
largely
on
two
particular
positions
which
she
applied
for
and
did
not
obtain.
those
two
positions
are
the
head
administrative
assistant
at
the
solomon
mental
health
centre,
exhibit
two
of
the
appendix
pertains
to
that
slot
and
to
the
positions
of
administrative
assistant
in
the
mental
health
system
generally,
in
exhibit
6
in
the
appendix
pertains
to
that.
i
will
return
to
these
two
positions
later
in
my
argument
and
will
demonstrate
that
in
each
instance,
any
injury
that
helen
feeney
suffered
by
virtue
of
the
application
of
veterans
preference
was
some
--
an
inquiry
that
she
shared
in
common
with
male
non-veterans
and
that
she
would
have
suffered
the
same
kind
of
injury
whatever
the
form
of
veterans
preference
had
been
applied
by
that
i
mean
it
for
5
and
10
point
preference
model
on
the
federal
system
had
been
in
effect.
but
for
this
court
the
plaintiff
has
recast
the
issue
if
you
will.
if
you
now
ask
the
question
whether
a
preference,
which
excludes
women
from
competitive
civil
service
positions
by
granting
them
an
absolute
preference
violates
the
14th
amendment.
her
argument
makes
it
clear
that
she
uses
the
word
competitive
in
this
context
an
essence
that
is
was
used
to
apply
to
upper
level,
higher
paying
positions.
there
are
two
other
statements
in
this
formulation
of
the
issue
which
i
want
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
first
is
the
assertion
that
the
preference
afforded
to
veterans
is
absolute.
as
the
earlier
discussion
of
the
massachusetts
system
shows
the
preference
is
not
absolutely
in
any
sense
of
the
word,
veterans’
first
have
to
pass
qualifying
examinations
in
order
to
benefit
from
the
preference,
and
then
maybe
passed
over
for
people
ranking
overall
examination
on
the
eligible
lists.
the
second
major
statement
which
courses
throughout
the
argument
is
that
somehow
helen
feeney
and
women
had
been
excluded;
excluded
from
the
federal
military
by
the
restrictive
policies
or
excluded
from
the
massachusetts
civil
service
system
by
application
of
veterans’
preference.
we
submit
the
record
in
this
case
just
as
not
support
those
broad
conclusary
statements,
but
the
exclusory
effects
of
this
statute
and
of
the
restrictive
federal
policies
are
more
fiction
than
fact.
while
veterans’
preference
does
benefit
a
class
comprised
more
significantly
of
men
than
females,
this
adverse
incidental
impact
is
not
enough
to
invalidate
the
statute
in
an
equal
protection
challenge.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
yes,
the
provision
on
defining
what
a
veteran
is,
is
chapter
4,
section
7
of
general
laws.
it
is
a
definitional
section,
which
applies
throughout
massachusetts
law.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
it
is
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
the
statute
that
cited
--
it’s
chapter
4,
section
7
and
i
believe
it’s
clause
43.
any
methodology
of
equal
protection
analysis
begins
with
a
focus
on
the
classification’s
facial
neutrality
or
the
nature
of
the
particular
classification.
i
do
not
intend
to
spend
much
time
on
the
nature
of
this
particular
classification.
the
statute
in
question
clearly
draws
lines
but
it
draws
lines
not
on
the
basis
of
one’s
gender
but
on
a
basis
of
objectively
identifiable
standards
shared
by
individuals
of
both
sexes.
it
restores
competitive
advantages
on
individuals
regardless
of
their
sex,
who
performed
military
service
for
the
nation
in
time
of
war
or
who
lost
their
husband
and
wife
or
son
or
daughter.
those
preferences
eligible
are
objectively
identifiable
and
they
are
objectively
identifiable
on
the
basis
of
characteristics
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
gender.
the
pool
of
eligibles
and
the
pool
of
ineligibles
are
both
comprised
of
significant
numbers
of
people
of
both
sexes.
under
any
categorization,
this
statute
is
facially
neutral
in
terms
of
gender.
now
however
uneven
the
application
of
the
statute
maybe,
you
never
that
obviate
that
facial
neutrality.
in
washington
and
davis
this
court
articulated
the
principle
that
fits
such
facially
neutral
acts
will
not
be
invalidated
solely
on
the
basics
of
discriminatory
impact.
in
arlington
heights
you
amplified
on
that
holding
and
suggested
a
number
of
evidentiary
factors
which
can
illuminate
the
search
for
discriminatory
intent.
one
might
have
thought
that
the
search
in
this
particular
case
would
have
been
very
simple,
after
all
the
district
court,
the
first
time
around
in
this
case
stated
that
the
massachusetts
veterans’
preference
statute
was
not
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
disqualifying
women
from
receiving
civil
service
appointments,
but
that
the
statute’s
laudable
purpose
was
not
enough
to
insulate
it
from
judicial
invalidation.
this
was
because
in
the
view
of
the
district
court
in
the
context
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
was
the
result
and
not
the
intent
of
the
act
which
mattered.
in
spite
of
the
obvious
differences
between
that
holding
and
this
court’s
holdings
and
washington
and
davis
and
arlington
heights,
in
this
case
the
district
court
did
make
a
finding
on
remand
of
discriminatory
intent,
and
i
submit
that
the
methodology
that
the
court
used
in
doing
so,
cannot
be
condoned
by
this
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
would
suggest
that
judge
toro’s
opinion
makes
a
specific
finding
of
intents.
judge
campbell
articulates
the
premise
that
under
washington
and
davis
this
is
a
very
difficult
case
to
deal
with
and
to
the
extent
that
one
must
find
discriminatory
intent
in
order
to
invalidate
the
statute
it’s
there,
he
votes
to
invalidate.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
that
if
i
might
characterize
judge
campbell’s
opinion
he
is
saying
that
forcibility
of
the
impact
is
the
equivalent
of
finding
an
intent
and
if
the
results
are
inevitable;
that,
that
in
itself.
that
predictably
discriminatory
impact
is
a
substitute
for
intent.
i
would
submit
that
awareness
of
probable
disparate
effect
could
never
be
the
constitutional
equivalent
of
a
finding
of
invidious
intent
to
discriminate.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
that
one
can
use
forcibility
of
impact
under
limited
circumstances
as
a
factor
in
the
evidentiary
search,
in
the
search
for
clear
and
convincing
evidence
or
for
substantial
evidence
that
intent
exists.
but
i
do
not
think
that
forcibility
of
impact
in
and
of
itself
can
ever
satisfy
an
intent
case
unless
the
impact
is
so
disparate
as
that
yet
may
be
welcome
maybe
another
types
of
cases
that
this
court
discussed
in
arlington
heights
and
in
washington
and
davis.
a
legislative
awareness
of
a
probable
disparate
effect
is
not
the
constitutional
equivalent
of
purposeful
discrimination.
the
contention
of
the
plaintiff
echoed
in
the
opinions
of
the
lower
court
that
the
purpose,
motive
and
intent,
somehow
all
mean
different
things
in
a
constitutional
sense,
i
think
it’s
treated
quite
well
in
the
solicitor
general
amicus
brief,
it
makes
the
point
that
the
purpose,
intent
and
motive
all
have
the
same
kind
of,
all
mean
the
same
thing
in
constitutional
cases
and
that
the
court
should
be
looking
for
convincing
evidence
of
the
motive
or
motives
which
influenced
in
a
particular
governmental
act.
now
the
court
in
this
case
focused
primarily
on
the
impact
of
the
statute,
saying
that
the
impact
was
predictable
and
that
it
was
devastating,
and
it
pointed
essentially
the
four
types
of
proof
of
that
fact.
mrs.
feeney’s
own
employment
record,
the
employment
record
of
other
women
in
the
official
classified
service.
some
unquantified
general
statements
about
the
way
veterans
preference
operates
that
appear
in
paragraph
20
of
the
aggrieved
statement
and
then
an
analysis
of
50
lists,
which
were
appended
to
the
complaint,
as
examples
of
thousands
of
lists,
an
example
of
lists
on
which
women
were
harmed
by
the
application
of
veterans'
preference,
but
not
as
typical
lists.
mrs.
feeney’s
own
employment
record
doesn’t
demonstrate
the
propositions
of
women
were
absolutely
excluded
from
upper
level
civil
service
jobs
and
by
the
application
of
veterans'
preference.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
am
contending
that
the
impact
of
this
particular
statute
has
been
consistently
overstated;
i’ll
do
it
on
this
basis.
helen
feeney
herself
held
a
significant
civil
service
position.
the
single
largest
group
of
individuals
hired
in
the
ten-year
period,
if
they’re
based
on
both
sex
and
veterans
status
in
non-veteran
females.
they
obtained
42.2%
of
all
of
the
jobs
in
the
ten-year
year
period.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
in
this
classification,
(inaudible)
stripping
male
veterans
(inaudible)
stripping
male
non-veterans.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
well,
all
i
am
saying
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
my
own
personal
view
is
that
traditionally
men
and
women
do
not
always
compete
for
the
same
jobs.
we
submitted
an
affidavit
of
wallace
counts
which
pertains
to
a
two-months
period
after
the
court
originally
invalidated
this
veteran’s
preference
statute
in
1976
and
it
demonstrated
that
on
61%
of
the
lists
compiled
in
that
timeframe,
veterans
preference
would
have
made
no
difference
on
the
gender
classification
of
those
certified
61%
of
the
times.
men
and
women
simply
do
not
always
compete.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
do,
i
remember
the
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
do.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
don’t
know
if
that
was
out
of
the
ordinary.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
this
record,
in
the
timeframe
that
we
have
this
evidence;
women
obtained
significantly
more
jobs
than
men.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
the
figures
that
we
have
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
the
figures
that
we
have--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
the
figures
which
we
have
mr.
justice
marshall
are
for
the
entire
official
classified
service.
now
the
court
would
extrapolate
from
50
lists
which
were
appended
as
examples
of
lists
on
which
women
were
harmed,
the
court
would
extrapolate
the
conclusion
that
somehow
women
are
excluded
from
upper
level
positions,
but
those
positions
are
listed
in
the
appendix
of
page
94
to
96,
and
those
positions
i
think
if
the
court
will
look
at
them,
do
not
demonstrate
or
not
themselves
upper
level
positions.
their
positions
on
there
like
school
bus
monitor,
telephone
operator,
teacher’s
aid;
those
aren't
the
kinds
of
upper
level
positions
that
the
court
can
be
talking
about
when
they
women
are
excluded
from
upper
level,
higher
paying
positions.
the
broad
general
statements
that
common
awareness
tells
us
the
truth,
the
women
and
men
don’t
always
compete
that
in
some
instances
veterans’
preference
will
hire
more
women
than
men,
those
are
truisms,
but
they
do
not
support--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
it
maybe,
it
maybe
it’s
somewhat
speculative
the
only
indication
in
this
record
that
that’s
the
case
is
that
helen
feeney
in
her
affidavit
says
in
someone
instances
she
herself
was
not
--
did
not
take
examinations.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
after
washington
and
davis
and
after
arlington
heights,
a
lower
court
has
to
look
for
clear
evidence,
hard
evidence
that
there
is
an
invidious
intent
to
discriminate
the
impact
in
this
case
and
this
record
does
not
demonstrate
that
kind
of
impact.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
motivating
factor
which
if
it’s
not
characterized
as
an
intent
to
harm
women
is
an
intent
to
perpetuate,
archaic
and
over
broad
stereotypical
notions
about
the
older
women.
there
has
to
be
a
motivating
factor,
which
is
in
some
way
invidious.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
no.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
no
i’m
not
saying--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
that
the
court
has
articulated
the
way
in
which
the
lower
court
looks
for
motivation
and
you
look
to
every
scintilla
of
subjective
or
objective
evidence
that
one
can
find.
you
have
articulated
evidentiary
factors.
all
i’m
saying
in
this
case
is
that
those
evidentiary
factors
do
not
support
an
influence
of
intent,
and
that
minimum
rationality
applies.
under
traditional
standards
of
the
equal
protection
analysis
and
minimum
rationality,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
wisdom
of
a
particular
statute.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
massachusetts
legislature
serve
every
conceivable
social
value
in
formulating
their
civil
service
system
in
their
veterans
preference
statute.
there
can
be
no
better
example
of
the
need
for
(inaudible)
for
state
legislatures,
that
in
the
area
of
distributing
civil
service
jobs
to
veterans,
minorities,
women
and
still
balancing
the
interest
of
the
state
and
effective
federal
workforce.
indeed
the
fact
is
that
legislators
throughout
this
country,
grappling
with
these
waiting
problems
have
adopted
a
myriad
of
approaches
to
veterans
preference
statutes,
almost
no
two
of
them
are
alike.
by
suggesting
that
minimum
rationality
applies
however
i
don’t
mean
to
imply
that
somehow
affording
benefits
to
veterans
is
a
less
worthy
social
goal
than
to
other,
than
other
remedial
social
policies.
we
are
not
talking
about
--
we
are
talking
about
a
group
of
individuals
who
themselves
have
sacrificed
in
time
of
war
and
a
deserving,
who
had
borne
the
battle
in
time
of
war
and
are
deserving
of
the
nation’s
approval.
