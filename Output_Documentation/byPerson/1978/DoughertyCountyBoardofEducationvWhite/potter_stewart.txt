when
was
this
rule
adopted
chronologically,
vis-Ã -vis
the
board's
becoming
aware
that
mr.
white's
was
intending
to
becoming
a
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
immediately
thereafter,
was
the
rule
adopted?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
rule
adopted
immediately
thereafter?
justice
potter
stewart
although
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
walters,
is
there
any
question
at
all
that
your
client
had
the
power
to
adopt
the
rule
that
it
did
adopt
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
doesn't
the
real
issue
become
whether
or
not
the
rule
that
was
adopted
is
a
standard
practice
or
a
procedure
with
respect
to
voting?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
isn't
the
issue
whether
or
not
it
is
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
that
the
real
issue,
since
you
concede
that
the
school
board
had
power
under
state
law
to
adopt
the
rule
it
did
adopt?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
did
and
it
did
adopt
this
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
no
question
of
its
power
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
you
agree
that
the
--
whether
that
was
adopted
as
a
rule
of
the
school
board
or
adopted
by
--
as
a
law
by
the
state
legislature,
the
test
would
be
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly.
but
the
question
would
be
that
its
legislating
of
a
rule
such,
as
it
was
described
by
my
brother
rehnquist,
would
be
the
legislation
of
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
be
issue,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
that
would
be
the
question,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
myers,
you're
addressing
yourself
now,
i
gather,
to
the
first
question
presented,
i.e.
whether
this
rule
is
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting?
justice
potter
stewart
not
to
the
second
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
only
issue
to
which
you're
addressing
yourself?
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
voting.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
it's
impact
would
be
a
matter
for
the
attorney
general
to
determine.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
substantive
inquiry
that
he
makes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
be
true
in
a
local
firehouse,
if
the
man
in
charged
at
firehouse
said
to
anyone
of
the
firemen
want
to
campaign
for
office,
take
your
off
duty
here,
you're
going
to
have
to
take
a
leave
of
absence.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
i
assume
that
the
head
of
the
firehouse
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
we
have
to
amend
my
example
because
you
don't
really
have
to
pre-clear.
he
could
come
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
file
a
lawsuit
and
get
authority,
couldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
an
option
always.
justice
potter
stewart
so
then
the
basic
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
covered
changed?
justice
potter
stewart
if
your
submission
is
correct,
because
theirs
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
school
board
is
a
state
agency?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
really
the
problem
of
the
argument
you're
making
you're
going
to
the
merits
of
the
question
that
the
attorney
general
would
be
required
to
decide
were
these
submitted
to
him,
because
as
my
brother
rehnquist
has
indicated
the
repeal
of
such
a
rule
of
this
would
be
under
your
submission
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
issue
before
us
not
the
merits.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
wonder
if
it
has
effect
on
negro
voters
is
a
matter
for
the
attorney
general
to
decide
if
this
is
required
to
be
submitted
to
him
under
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
are
concerned
--
we're
concerned
with
that
question
not
with
the
merits
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
the
reduction
on
the
filing
fee
come
equally
within
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
simply
intended
to
say
that
the
state
legislature
would
have
been
a
covered
entity
under
section
4.
