justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
walters,
what
about
the
case
involved
in
the
city
of
sheffield?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
everything
that
you've
said
so
far
applies
equally
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
myer,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
you've
got
two
issues,
the
standard
or
practice
issue
on
whether
this
unit
is
covered
and
i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
coverage
of
the
school
board.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
supposing
instead
of
the
school
board
action,
you
had
say
the
social
science
department
of
the
high
school
thought
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
some
teachers
in
the
legislature,
and
so
they
entered
the
social
science
department
adopted
a
rule
without
clearing
it
with
the
county
board,
that
said,
"those
who
run
for
election
during
the
fall
will
have
a
half
teaching
schedule
on
the
fall
and
a
double
teaching
schedule
in
the
spring
or
something
like
that"
would
that
unit
have
to
get
clearance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
truly
be
a
practice
--
a
standard
of
practice
that
have
the
same
effect
on
a
bit
encourage
and
why
would
they
have
to
clear
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
assume
that
--
assume
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
head
of
the
department
has
scheduling
authority,
he
just
decides
he'd
like
to
have
this
teacher
run
for
election
at
fall.
so,
he
said,
our
rule
would
be,
if
you
run
for
election
at
fall,
you're
taking
extra
course
in
the
spring
and
one
less
in
the
fall.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
pre-clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
coach
of
the
football
team
says,
you
can
be
excused
for
practice
on
friday,
that
have
to
be
pre-cleared
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
line
coach
doesn't
have
to
show
up
on
friday,
so
he
has
and
extra
date
to
campaign.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
want
to
encourage
him
to
run
for
office.
justice
john
paul
stevens
basically,
that's
what
sheffield
holds,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
walters,
supposing
the
rule
increased
the
amount
of
filing
fees
for
candidates,
would
that
be
a
standard
practice
with
respect
to
voting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no
but
would
you
agree
that
if
the
whatever
--
whatever
state
entity
had
the
authority
to
do
it,
you
pass
some
rule
that
increase
the
filing
fee
and
therefore
made
the
candidate's
choice
of
whether
the
run
or
not
to
run
more
difficult
would
that
be
a
standard
or
practice
with
respect
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
how
is
this
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
cannot
earn
$3,000.00
this
fall
if
you
run
for
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
there's
an
affidavit
in
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
possible
for
him
to
practice
both
to
be
an
employment
practice
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
a
standard
practice
effecting
voting
within
the
meeting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
