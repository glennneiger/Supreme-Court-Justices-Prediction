mr.
john
r.
myer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
statement
of
facts
as
presented
by
counsel
for
appellant
is
correct
in
so
far
as
it
goes.
i
would,
however,
like
to
add
certain
additional
facts
that
i
think
are
relevant
to
the
court's
inquiry.
the
first
is
that,
in
may
of
1972,
when
appellee
john
white
announced
his
intention
to
run,
he
was
the
first
black
candidate,
at
least
in
living
memory,
and
perhaps
since
reconstruction
in
their
times,
to
run
for
the
state
general
assembly.
mr.
john
r.
myer
we
think,
your
honor,
the
issue
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
it
makes
a
difference
not
in
this
case,
but
it
does
we
think
in
terms
of
the
substantive
section
5
question
which
if
this
had
been
submitted,
is
the
inquiry
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
court
of
columbia.
and
we
are
suggesting
this
as
well
as
certain
other
circumstances
surrounding
the
adoption
of
the
rule
because
it
is
apparent
that
there
is
a
potential
in
this
case.
and
if
that
is
the
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
yes
your
honor,
it
would.
mr.
john
r.
myer
because
this
is
simply
is
an
illustration,
i
think,
your
honor
of
the
kind
of
change
that
can
be
made
in
a
circumstance
which
raises
some
suspicion
without
determining
whether
or
not
in
fact
it
violates
section
5
standards
of
purpose
or
effect
but
rather
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
think
it
is
relevant
that
immediately
upon
announcing,
the
rule
was
adopted.
mr.
john
r.
myer
mr.
white
was
also,
so
far
as
any
record
show,
the
record
is
clear
that
he
is
the
first
also
to
ever
announce
to
run.
mr.
john
r.
myer
but
the
issue
before
the
court
below
is
not
the
substantive
determination,
it
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
rule
58
is
a
covered
change
under
section
5
and
(b)
as
the
second
question
on
the
jurisdictional
statement,
whether
or
not
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
is
a
covered
entity.
mr.
john
r.
myer
for
section
5
coverage
question,
that
is
correct
although
that
is
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
which
would
be
made
upon
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
john
r.
myer
your
honor,
the
complaint
is
filed
in
five
counts
and
there's
a
1983
count,
there
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
and
equal
protection
count
as
well
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
count.
the
case
was
disposed
of
on
cross
motions
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
section
5
issue
and
that
having
been
resolved
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
it
rendered
it
unnecessary
then
to
reach
the
other
counsel
in
the
compliant.
mr.
john
r.
myer
the
only
difference
there,
your
honor,
is
that
as
a
private
employer,
they're
clearly
not
covered
by
section
5,
that
is
the
voting
rights
act
only
extends
to
those
designated
jurisdictions
and
as
this
court
has
clarified
in
sheffield,
state
actors
within
that
designated
jurisdiction,
whether
it
is
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
oh,
i
believe
it
is.
but
it
is
only
applicable
to
state
actors,
not
to
private
sector
of
the
country.
mr.
john
r.
myer
as
a
matter
of
what
congress
intended
when
it
adopted
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
that
is
the
--
no,
the
question
is
whether
the
standard
practice
or
procedure
and
that
is
the
substantive
determination
that
the
attorney
general
makes
once
it
submitted
it,
that
is
whether
it
has
a
potential
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
no,
the
answer
is
no.
now
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
well
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
this
was
a
qualification
for
candidacy
in
so
far
as
public
employees
of
dougherty
county
board
of
education
and
that
it
impose
a
very
substantial
financial
barrier.
mr.
john
r.
myer
no,
that's
correct.
there
was
a
disincentive
for
running
just
as
for
example
in
whitley,
there
were
disincentives
and
there
were
increased
barriers
to
qualifying
as
an
independent
candidate.
mr.
john
r.
myer
that's
correct,
and
indeed
the
school
board's
policy
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
no,
in
fact,
under
the
schools
board's
policy,
they
would
not
fire
him
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
they
require
him
to
take
leave
even
though
during
the
time
he
was
running,
he
was
ready,
able
and
willing
to
perform
his
contractual
duties.
mr.
john
r.
myer
yes
sir,
because
i
think
that
is
an
irrelevant
factor
in
so
far
as
to
determining
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
he
should
get
the
salary
so
long
as
he
is
certainly
performing
his
duties
and
that
for
example,
i
think,
suggests
the
question
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
of
mr.
walters,
that
is
if
instead
of
an
electoral
context,
we
had
a
liquor
business
that
he
was
operating
on
the
side,
he
could
obviously
have
two
incomes.
but
i
think
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
would
receive
some
supplemental
in
a
particular
case
does
not
--
is
not
a
relevant
factor
in
determining
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
and
was
ready
and
able
to
do
so
during
the
time
that
he
was
campaigning.
mr.
john
r.
myer
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
r.
myer
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
r.
myer
that
is
correct,
exactly.
mr.
john
r.
myer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
r.
myer
i'll
answer
any
question
of
the
court.
mr.
john
r.
myer
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
the
hypothetical.
it
is
a
state
statute
that
says,
during
the
time
you
are
campaigning,
in
order
to
receive
pay,
you
must
be
willing
to
work
half-time?
mr.
john
r.
myer
i
think
clearly
that
that
is
a
change
in
the
election
law
insofar
as
it
sets
forth
standards,
practices
or
procedures
with
respect
to
campaigning
and
offering
for
candidacy.
mr.
john
r.
myer
and
it
is
--
and
that
as
this
court
has
defined
the
voting
language
within
section
5
that
encompasses
candidacy.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
that
congress
intended
and
certainly,
if
there
were
any
question
in
the
65
act,
the
ratification
of
this
court's
decision
in
allen
and
the
companion
cases
in
both
1970
and
1975,
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
it's
congress'
intention
that
this
act
should
apply
in
the
most
minor
way.
and
i
think
that
where
there
is
any
alteration,
as
this
court
has
said,
that
has
to
be
submitted.
now,
the
court
has
posed
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
if
the
attorney
general
objected
and
so
that
that
state
statute
could
to
go
in
to
effect,
congress
intended
that.
i
think
congress
intended
for
that
kind
of
scrutiny
and
has
provided,
not
only
an
expedited
consideration
under
the
60-day
provision
submission
to
the
attorney
general,
but
where
there
is
an
objection
that
state,
the
state
of
georgia,
could
then
come
in
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
raise
that
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
that's
a
violation
of
the
substantive
standards
as
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
such
as
beer
in
this
court.
mr.
john
r.
myer
your
honor,
it
is
not
--
the
record
is
not
--
does
not
contain
what
the
racial
composition
of
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
is.if
for
example,
however,
and
we
do
have
statistic
--
census
information
in
the
brief
that
show
that
in
excess
of
53%
of
those
listed
in
the
1970
census
were
black.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
that
i
do
not
know.
mr.
john
r.
myer
it
is
likely.
mr.
john
r.
myer
correct.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
may
be
true
except
that
i
would
have
submit
that
the
philosophy
behind
the
kind
remedy
that
section
5
represents
was
not
to
focus
on
the
discrimination
issue
alone,
that
is
if
there
was
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
in
effect
in
june
of
1964
that
is
patently
discriminatory,
it
escapes
section
5
inquiry.
and
if
subsequent
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
any
covered
entity
makes
any
change
no
matter
how
ameliorative
or
how
discriminatory
that
change
should
be
submitted.
and
that
was
based
upon
a
hundred
years
of
congress
trying
to
deal
with
voting
rights
discrimination
starting
with
section
5
of
the
1870
voting
rights
act,
continuing
in
the
1957
act,
continued
in
the
1960
act,
and
included
in
the
1964
act.
mr.
john
r.
myer
it
would,
your
honor
if
it
represents
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
there
is
no
question
in
my
view
if
it
represents
a
change
from
what
was
in
effect,
november
1,
1964.
now,
to
return
to
mr.
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
under
the
substantive
inquiry--
mr.
john
r.
myer
that
is
correct.
and
to
return
to
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
justice
white
was
posing
to
counsel
for
appellant,
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
if
the
georgia
general
assembly
adopted
rule
58
but
simply
made
it
applicable
to
every
employee
or
even
every
board
of
education
employee,
and
in
fact
made
it
a
part
of
the
electoral
statute
for
the
state
of
georgia,
title
34,
that
would
have
to
be
submitted.given
that,
and
given
this
court's
decision
in
sheffield,
then
i
think
this
case
demonstrates
the
soundness
of
that
analysis,
you
have
a
delegated
power,
under
georgia
code
32-1011,
the
local
boards
of
education
are
granted
the
authority
to
conduct
their
affairs.
and
they
have
done
on
a
localized
basis
what
clearly
is
the
state
did
on
a
statewide
basis
would
be
submitted
under
the
act.
mr.
john
r.
myer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
r.
myer
no.
mr.
john
r.
myer
at
least
in
the
hypothetical
as
you
opposed
it
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
would
be
a
state
law
question
and
could
in
fact
be
challenged
on
the
grounds
that
only
the
state
board
of
education--i
mean
the
local
board
of
education
have--
mr.
john
r.
myer
assuming
arguendo
that
the
social
science
department
had
the
authority
to
do
it.
mr.
john
r.
myer
then,
quite
clearly,
i
think
on
the
sheffield
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
he
had
to
submit.
mr.
john
r.
myer
and
that
is
as
sheffield
determined
the
designation
in
14
(c)
(2)
are
related
to
designation.
once
designated
any
state
actor
within
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
well
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
(voice
overlap)
that's
correct,
and
as
a
state
actor,
if
that
altered
any
standard
practice
or
procedure
which
affected
and
assuming
that
it
was
also
a
covered
change,
assuming
that
as
well.
mr.
john
r.
myer
and
so
that
the
only
inquiry
is
the
entity,
if
that
entity
through
any
of
the
subagents
has
made
a
change,
that
would
have
to
be
under
the
operating
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
and
that's
what
sheffield
holds
at
any
state
actor,
exercising
control
within
a
designated
jurisdiction
must
submit.now,
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
again,
assuming
that
in
the
distribution
of
the
power
of
control
and
regulation
over
fire
department
it
was
that
delegated.
mr.
john
r.
myer
that's
correct,
again,
so
long
as
the
change
is
a
standard
--
is
a
covered
change,
any
state
actor
under
this
court's
decision
in
sheffield
must
submit
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
sound
rule
because
in
this
case,
indeed,
in
dougherty
county,
there
is
the
decision
that's
decided
paige
versus
gray.
and
in
that,
the
district
judge
there
last
year,
in
a
white
versus
regester
case,
involving
albany,
described
the
entire
history
or
segregation
in
albany
and
dougherty
county
and
stated
that,
like
most
and
many
cities
in
the
south,
segregation
has
been
eliminated
in
the
government
very
slowly
and
generally
only
by
court
order
so
that
the
potential
to
circumvent
what
section
5
was
intended
to
do
is
very
substantial.
and
where
we
have
enacted
at
the
state
law
level
would
be
covered
to
say
that
the
entity
ought
escape
it
because
it
is
only
at
the
local
level,
i
think
would
defeat
the
purposes
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
that's
correct,
although
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
he
always
has
that
option
and
i
would
say
that
the
burden
in
section
5,
congress
intended
to
shift
the
burden.
that
is
a
case
by
case
approach,
had
not
work
for
a
hundred
years.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
that's
correct.in
so
far
as
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
that
is
correct.
the
legal
test
would
be
if
you
are
state
actor
and
assuming
that
it's
a
covered
change,
it
must
be
pretty
cleared.
mr.
john
r.
myer
that
is
correct
and
we--
mr.
john
r.
myer
that
is
correct
and
now
it's
a
political
subdivision.
mr.
john
r.
myer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
r.
myer
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
pending
before
this
court
right
now
on
jurisdictional
statements
filed
in
july
is
a
jurisdictional
statement
by
both
the
wilkes
county,
georgia
board
of
education
and
the
wilkes
county
board
of
commissioners
of
roads
and
revenues
where
pursuant
to
section
5
case,
private
cases,
they
filed
changes,
state
law
changes
from
district
at
large.
the
attorney
general
objects
wilkes
county,
georgia
both
entities
have
filed
lawsuits
in
the
district
court
of
columbia
and
engaged
in
a
trial
and
there
was
a
decision
adverse
and
they
are
then
bringing
the
case
here.
the
1970
census
shows
that
wilkes
county,
georgia
has
a
population
of
8000
people.
they
have
clearly
made
a
determination
and
clearly
have
the
resources
to
bring
that
action
just
as
in
this
case
dougherty
county
board
of
education
has
determined
that
rather
than
submit
rule
58,
they
have
the
resources
to
bring
this
case
to
the
supreme
court
for
its
determination.
so,
i
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
my
answer
is
yes
and
those
are
certainly
examples
in
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
john
r.
myer
i
do
not
have
the
current
figures
as
i
recall
the
testimony
in
this
75
extension.
it
was
approximately
a
thousand
a
year
and
i'm
sure
that
mr.
wallace
may
or
may
will
have
that
information.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
that's
right
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
oh
well,
clearly
and
i
think
mr.
wallace
may
have
the
figures,
i
would
assume
that
99
%
of
the
submissions
made
to
the
attorney
general
are
approved,
that
is
they
are
nondiscriminatory,
so
that
we
are
not
talking
about
three
lawsuits
a
day
and
indeed
the
number
of
cases
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
i'm
sure
is
relatively
small
just
as
for
example
the
number
of
section
or
the
number
of
cases
that
the
attorney
general
has
brought
enforcing
section
5
that
is
prior
between
1970
and
the
testimony
of
1975,
there
were
26
lawsuits
brought
by
the
attorney
general
to
enforced
the
voting
rights
act,
so
that
the
burden
i
think
on
the
courts
has
at
least
empirically
not
been
shown
and
i'm
sure
that
at
some
point
if
congress
were
to
be
convinced
to
that
as
they
will
have
the
opportunity
in
1982
that
alteration
can
be
made.
i
would
want
--
one
additional
argument
that
i
would
like
to
submit
is
that
this
kind
of
change
and
in
terms
of
where
is
the
line
drawn
i
think
that
congress
in
enacting
section
5
contemplated
or
was
trying
to
deal
with
all
sorts
of
changes
and
therefore
it
was
the
intent
in
fact
by
the
submission
process
not
to
say
specifically
and
not
to
be
able
to
define
specifically
every
conceivable
change
and
indeed
there
was
attorney
general
burt
marshall's
testimony
about
the
infinite
variety
of
ways
that
school
districts
around
the
country
had
found
to
come
up
with
new
devices
to
delay
desegregation.
so
that,
whatever
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
hypothetical
suits
can
be
submitted
but
the
standard
and
the
line
to
draw
in
this
case
is
i
think
very
clear
and
that
line
is
where
there
is
a
rule
or
change
which
directly
addresses
the
electoral
system
as
this
does,
then
that
clearly,
whatever
the
other
kinds
of
potential
hypothetical
and
potential
factual
situations
would
arise
but
that
clearly
is
covered.
and
that
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned
that
provides
the
current
of
standard
or
rule
to
set
in
this
case.
that
is
where
the
action
of
directly
addresses
the
electoral
process
then
at
least,
well,
that's
not
the
final
line,
that's
as
far
as
this
court
needs
to
go.
mr.
john
r.
myer
absolutely,
and
even
if
for
example
in
the
sanitation
department
if
the
majority
of
the
workers
there
were
black.
mr.
john
r.
myer
i
think,
technically
that
would
be
submitted,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
modicum
of
common
sense
that
does
enter
into
the
operation
of
the
act
in
that
it
is
essentially
those
changes
which
are
goring
someone's
ox
that
are
the
one's
that
come
to
controversy
and
there
are
many
but
as
a
technical
matter
i
would
agree
that
that
would
happen.
mr.
john
r.
myer
indeed
he
could,
indeed
he
could.
final
argument
is
that
i
think
under
this
court's
decision,
that
is
one
to
go
return
to
the
question
for
coverage
standard
practice
or
procedure
that
i
think
the
court's
decisions
in
whitley
and
subsequently
hadnott
v.
amos
show
very
clearly
that
where
there
is
a
change
concerning
qualification
and
increase
substantial,
increase
barriers
to
candidacy,
those
kinds
of
changes
are
contemplated.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well
section
5
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
this
is
the
first
case
coming
up
like
this,
there
is
at
least
to
my
knowledge
but
section
5,
mr.
justice
white,
does
not
look
at
the
degree
of
control
that
is
if
you
begin
to
talk
about
control
moving
a
polling
place
25
feet
is
not
a
major
impact.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
i
think
that
your
question
was
section
5
was
intended
to
deal
with
those
changes
which
addressed
the
electoral
process
and
my
response
is
at
least
in
so
far
of
rule
58
is
concerned
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
it
directly
deals
with
voting
as
voting
has
been
defined
by
this
court.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
this
court
has
defined
the
language
of
the
term
voting.
mr.
john
r.
myer
because
it
imposes
a
very
substantial
economic
barrier
to
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
it
does
not
impose
a
technical
qualification
as
the
prior
colloquy
involve
of
disqualifying.
however
--
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
although
that
goes
to
the
substantive
question,
mr.
white.
it
seems
to
me
it
may
well
be
intended
to
do
that.
that
is
even
though
an
employee
is
willing
to
work,
it
has
a
discouraging
effect,
that
is
you
are
--
you
need
income
and
it
has
that
obvious
impact
of
saying
even
though
during
the
time
you're
running
for
office,
you
are
ready,
able
and
willing
to
perform
the
work
contemplated
under
the
contract.
mr.
john
r.
myer
i
think
that
in
those
circumstances
where
it
is
not
directly
affect,
it
may
will
be
that,
that
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
john
r.
myer
well,
except
that
where
standards
with
directly
addresses
and
may
and
constitute
change
then
those
would
be
covered
and
indeed
if
that
will
also
cover
if
instead
of
directly
addressing
it
if
it
did
it
in
an
across
the
board
fashion,
i
think
that
in
circumstances,
that
also
would
have
to
be
submitted
and
there
are
number
of
hypotheticals
that
i
think
would
have
to
be
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
but
i
think
that
this
case
is
at
least
clear
on
its
facts
that
insofar
as
the
rule
directly
addresses
where
it
is
clearly
the
intention
of
the
dougherty
county
of
board
of
education
to
affect
running
for
office
that
is
a
covered
change.
mr.
john
r.
myer
all
we
are
saying
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
it
ought
to
be
submitted
and
that
substantive
inquiry
is
one
the
attorney
general
makes.
mr.
john
r.
myer
and
he
could
may
well
approve
it
as
he
does
most
of
the
submissions
which
he
receives.
thank
you.
