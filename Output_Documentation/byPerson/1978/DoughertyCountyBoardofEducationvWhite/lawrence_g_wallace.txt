mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
key
to
this
case
in
our
view
is
to
be
found
in
this
court's
statement
five
years
ago
in
georgia
against
the
united
states
that
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
not
concerned
with
simple
inventory
of
voting
procedures
but
rather
with
the
reality
of
change
practices
as
they
affect
the
negro
voter.
the
problem
in
this
case
came
to
our
attention
as
a
result
of
the
complaint
filed
on
behalf
of
mr.
white
and
we
took
a
look
at
it.
there's
a
stipulation
in
this
record
that
as
a
result
of
the
adoption
of
rule
58,
mr.
white
was
required
to
take
a
lead
of
absence
of
approximately
three
months
time
without
pay
in
1972,
of
approximately
five
months
in
1974
and
approximately
three
months
in
1976.it
was
only
in
1974
that
he
was
involved
and
contested
general
election
campaign
as
well
as
primary
campaign
and
in
the
printed
appendix
on
page
24
(a),
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
there
is
listed
in
his
affidavit
the
sums
of
money
that
he
lost
in
compensation
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
this
rule
to
him
even
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
the
result
might
be
different
but
the
question
is
whether
this
is
a
rule
covered
by
section
5.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
what
makes
a
difference
as
we
view
the
purpose
of
section
5
as
explained
by
the
court
and
the
quotation
that
i
started
my
argument
with,
what
makes
a
difference
is
the
potential
impact
on
the
reality
of
affecting
voting
rights
and
we
have
to
look
to
see
what
is
involved
here
and
compare
it
with
the
experiences
that
we've
had
under
section
5
which
is
what
i'm
attempting
to
do
here
for
the
benefit
of
the
court.
as
we
look
at
the
figures
at
the
bottom
of
page
24
(a),
we
see
first
of
all
that
these
figures
suggest
that
mr.
white
is
probably
not
a
very
affluent
individual
since
three
months
of
salary
1972
amounted
to
$2810.00
and
so
forth.
the
second
thing
we
noticed
is
that
these
are
rather
substantial
sums
to
have
to
be
forfeiting
in
order
to
be
able
to
run
for
office
in
comparison
with
the
closest
analogy
that
we
have
been
dealing
with
under
the
voting
rights
act
in
our
experience
which
is
changes
in
the
size
of
filing
fees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
looking
at
potential
impact
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
merely
trying
to
follow
this
court's
admonition
in
georgia
against
the
united
states
that
the
act
is
to
be
determined
with
regard
to
the
realities
of
changes
in
voting
rights
as
they
affect
negro
voters
and
candidates
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
trying
to
determine
whether
this
is
a
change
that's
covered
and
in
order
to
determine
whether
it's
a
change
that's
covered,
we
first
look
to
see
what
kind
of
a
change
it
is
and
compare
it
with
other
changes
that
we
know
are
within
the
coverage
of
the
act
that
we
have
been
dealing
with
and
increases
in
filing
fees
were
singled
out
for
mention
in
the
1975
committee
reports
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
as
examples
of
changes
for
which
the
attorney
general
has
properly
interposed
objections
under
the
voting
rights
act
which
congress
was
extending.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
attempting
to
argue
the
merits
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
understand.
i'm
not
attempting
to
argue
the
merits,
mr.
justice.i'm
merely
trying
to
see
whether
this
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
and
the
statute
applies
to
changes
as
they,
in
reality,
affect
opportunities
to
exercise
voting
rights
and
to
run
for
office
and
we
look
at
department
of
justice
records
with
respect
to
increases
in
filing
fees
shortly
before
the
fact
that
we
had
to
interpose
objections
to
some
of
them
was
approved
by
both
committees
of
congress
as
proper
administration
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
see
what
kinds
of
changes,
what
kinds
of
financial
burdens,
had
required
us
in
our
view
to
interpose
objections
because
of
the
burdens
that
they
placed
on
the
ability
of
individuals
to
run
for
office
and
what
we
saw
as
a
few
examples
in
1973
is
that
we
saw
fit
to
interpose
an
objection
to
an
increase
in
ocilla,
georgia
of
the
filing
fee
to
run
for
mayor
from
$10.00
to
$125.00
and
to
run
for
the
council
from
$10.00
to
$100.00.
we
had
similar
examples
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course.
of
course
but
the
point
is
the
questions
from
the
bench
have
suggested
that
this
case
threatens
to
deflect
us
into
trivia
but
we're
talking
about
a
case
in
which
on
its
face,
on
the
allegations
of
the
compliant,
a
burden
of
several
thousand
dollars
has
been
imposed
on
the
ability
of
a
candidate
to
run
for
office
where
we
have
been
required
to
review
burdens
of
less
than
a
hundred
dollars
that
have
been
impose
in
the
change
in
filing
fees.
it's
true
that
this
is
not
in
form
a
filing
fee
but
the
economic
impact
on
the
face
of
it
is
very
similar
as
a
disincentive
to
run
for
office.
somehow,
this
money
must
be
found,
he
has
to
do
without
it
whether
he
has
to
pay
it
as
a
filing
fee
or
not
and
if
the
state
legislature
were
to
adopt
a
rule
of
local
legislation
that
employees
of
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
in
order
to
run
for
the
state
legislature
must
pay
a
filing
fee
of
$3,000.00
or
must
pay
a
filing
fee
equivalent
to
three
months
salary,
it
would
be
obvious
that,
that
would
be
a
change
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
but
the
point
is
that
congress
--
the
fundamental
premise
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
that
congress
believed
it
could
not
anticipate
the
form
that
new
obstacles
to
a
voting
rights
and
to
running
for
office
might
take
and
therefore
as
the
court
said
in
sheffield,
it
shifted
the
advantages
of
time
and
inertia
from
the
perpetrators
of
discrimination
to
its
victims.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
rule
had
been
in
effect,
of
course
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are
many
submissions
that
are
approved
very
readily.
the
question
was
asked
what
number
of
submissions
are
we
getting.
the
latest
figures
indicate
that
it's
approximately
2,000
submissions
a
year
involving
approximately
4500
changes
because
a
number
of
this
submissions
involved
multiple
changes
and
less
than
2%
of
those
result
in
an
objection
being
interposed
and
about
91%
of
the
pre-clearance
is
given
without
any
further
interchange
of
correspondence.
of
course
there
are
many
routine
submissions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
way
the
numbers
are
running
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
voting
rights
act
section
of
the
civil
rights
division
of
the
department
of
justice
is
staffed
to
implement
the
policies
reflected
in
this
act
which
has
been
one
of
the
most
successful
civil
rights
acts
in
history
and
the
fact
that
the
percentage
of
objections
interposed
this
small,
doesn't
detract
from
the
fact
that
the
act
has
resulted
in
great
changes
in
voting
and
candidacy
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
and
where
the
objections
are
interposed,
they
often
amount
to
very
important
safeguards
whereas
my
co-counsel
said
a
hundred
years
of
trying
to
deal
with
these
matters
after
the
fact
case
by
case
had
proved
unsuccessful.
