justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
of
georgia
or
the
dougherty
county
adopted
a
rule
saying
that
no
person
who
is
physically
absent
from
his
place
of
potential
employment
as
a
county
employee
or
a
state
employee
shall
be
paid
his
wages,
and
that
was
applied
to
someone
who
ran
for
the
united
states
senate
from
georgia.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
simply
saying
you
got
to
be
there
and
perform
your
service
if
you're
going
to
be
paid.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
justice
stewart's
asking
you?
would
such
a
rule
be
a
standard
practice
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
ford
motor
company
had
a
plant
in
albany,
georgia
and
first
time
a
black
employee
sought
to
run
for
political
office
and
it
adopted
exactly
the
same
rule
that
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
had
adopted.
your
argument
is
to
the
potential
for
abuse
would
be
just
as
good
there
as
in
the
case
of
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
potential
for
discrimination
really
isn't
that
any
part
of
the
statutory
test,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
as
a
matter
of
statutory
coverage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you
say
that,
yes,
it
isn't
enough
that
it
be
a
standard
plan
or
practice,
it
has
to
have
a
potential
for
discrimination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
deciding
of
whether
it's
to
be
submitted
or
not,
is
there
any
inquiry
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
answers
would
apply
not
just
in
dougherty
county,
where
you
said
they
have
been
very
slow
in
eliminating
segregation
but
in
every
other
conceivable
municipal
corporation
in
a
covered
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
really,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
they
had
been
slow
in
eliminating
segregation
in
dougherty
county
as
far
as
the
legal
test
is
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
what
if
the
school
board
did
have
this
rule
in
1965
and
then
abolished
it,
so
that
and
they
admitted
easier
for
candidates
to
run.
under
your
co-counsel's
submission
that
nonetheless
would
have
had
been
submitted
at
the
justice
department.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
really,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
whether
it
deters
someone
or
encourages
them.
