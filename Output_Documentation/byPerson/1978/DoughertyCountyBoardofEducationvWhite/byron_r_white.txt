justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
state
legislature
passed
a
law
that
said
that
all
employers
must
give
an
hour
off
for
elections?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
have
to
be
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
what
if
the
legislature
delegated
the
decision
with
respect
to
that
to
a
school
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
well
then,
what
if
there
was
no
state
law
about
it.
it
just
happened
to
be
but
a
school
board,
an
individual
school
board,
did
pass
a
rule
limiting
or
someway
bearing
on
how
much
time
people
get
off
to
go
to
the
polls
and
it
was
challenged
then
the
state
--
and
then
the
state
court
said
the
school
board
has
that
power
under
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
--
is
there
much
different
impact
if
the
board
then,
within
its
powers,
passed
a
resolution
that
said
that
any
teacher
who
declares
himself
for
public
office
must
resign?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
certainly
--
you
maybe
quite
right,
but
even
so,
it's
hard
to
deny
that
the
board's
rule
would
have
an
impact
on
who's
going
to
run
for
office
and
who
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
that
isn't
the
test
under
the
section
5,
but
it
does
have
the
impact.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
state
--
what
if
the
state
legislature
passed
the
same
rule
and
says,
no
public
employee
may
run
for
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
if
the
legislature
delegated
that
part
to
a
school
board
and
said,
but
in
the
case
of
school
boards,
we'll
leave
it
up
to
the
individual
school
boards?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
but
suppose
the
legislature
doesn't
pass
such
a
law,
but
it's
determined
by
a
court
that
the
school
board
does
have
that
power
under
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
were
--
what
if
it's
determined
by
a
state
court
that
the
board
has
that
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
we
can't
keenly
decide
the
case.
if
they
have
the
power
under
the
state
law,
would
you
concede
that
it's
covered
by
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
already
also
conceded
that
the
state
legislature
adopted
the
same
rule.
it
is
a
standard
and
covered
by
section
5.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no.
i
asked
you
if
you
have
the
state
legislature
said
that
no
public
employee
way
run
for
office,
you
say
--
i
thought
you
conceded
that
that
would
be
covered
by
section
5
because
it
was
a
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
not
be
covered
by
section
5
whether
it
was
passed
for
the
state
legislature
or
the
school
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
[inaudible]
section
5
there
wasn't
a
change,
but
i
didn't
know
you're
contending
that
it
wasn't
a
change?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
legal
decision
below
is
against
you
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
what
georgia
law
is
that
this
was
a
change.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
submission
that
any
kind
of
an
official
rule
that
has
some
kind
of
an
impact
on
an
election
or
it's
just
a
standard
of
practice?
just
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can
see
why
i
call
them
maybe
a
qualification
for
candidacy
or
something
that
this
wasn't
the
qualification
for
candidacy.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
there
wasn't
any
--
but,
there
wasn't
any
disqualification
from
running
imposed
on
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
a
school
teacher
went
over
and
filed
as
a
candidate,
they
wouldn't
reject
his
papers
because
he
was
employed
by
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
school
board
might
fire
him,
but
i
don't
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
wouldn't
fire
him,
they
just
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
question
is
whether
he
gets
paid
for
no
services,
he
wanted
to
perform
the
services
and
get
paid
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
any
other
cases
just
like
the
current.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
can
read
section
5
as
saying,
it's
not
that
it.
we're
really
dealing
with
laws
that
are
really
intended
to
deal
directly
with
the
electoral
process.
the
voting
or
the
electoral
process
and
if
some
school
board
just
for
efficiency
says,
look
you
got
a
work
and
you
can
have
an
hour
off,
then
why
should
that
be
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
it
covers
this
one.
that
maybe
and
say
if
you're
going
to
make
a
rule
on
how
much
time
you
have
off
for
voting,
they
do
--
they're
really
dealing
directly
with
the
voting.
this
one
doesn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
doesn't
do
that.it's
outside
of
that
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
it
directly
deal
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
does
it
directly
deal
with
candidacy?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
and
impose
a
qualification.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
intended
to
disqualify.
either
as
far
as
you
can
tell
it's
intended
to
--
it's
intended
to
do
and
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask
you
again,
do
you
want
to
change
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
asked
you
if
the
state
legislature
had
said,
had
passed
this
very
rule
and
applicable
to
all
public
employment
or
to
all
school
boards
whether
it
would
be
a
covered
rule
and
you
said
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
to
change
your
answer
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree,
i
agree
with
you
i
just
thought
that
you
would
earlier
in
the
argument
you
would
say
if
the
set
legislature
had
adopted
this
rule,
that
would
be
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
accept
your
latest
answer
to
the
same
question.
