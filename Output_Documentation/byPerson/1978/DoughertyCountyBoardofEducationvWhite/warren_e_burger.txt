chief

e.

had
they
ever
had
any
experience
of
this
kind
before
that
employees
may
run?
chief

in
the

chief

e.

we'll
resume
arguments
now
in
pending
case,
mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me
counsel,
do
you
mean,
your
negative
answer
to
the
question
or
to
the
merits
of
the
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
have
control
of
the
electoral
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that's
an
implied
condition
of
his

the
question
due
extensively,

enlarge

time
five
minutes
and
enlarge
your

five
minutes

chief

e.

but
they

divide
it
as
they
wish.
you
may
reserve
it
if
you
wish
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
myer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
make
a
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
make
a
difference
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
myer,
it's
not
unknown
in
political
life
that
people
who
leave
their
employment
to
campaign
for
public
office
have
an
arrangement
with
their
campaign
committees
that
their
living
cost
or
their
regular
salary
is
supplanted
by
their
supporters.
now,
suppose
the
record
in
this
case
or
any
case
would
show,
that
the
campaign
committee
had
provided
the
substitute
for
the
salary,
suppose
that
was
shown
in
this
case,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
should
get
two
salaries
then,
he
should
get
the
salary
from
his
committee
and
a
salary
from
the
public
also?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
people
are
affected
by
this
rule
mr.
myer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
talking
about
those
who
work
for
this
board
under
affected
by
this
rule
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
not
the
voting
population.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
likely
that
majority
of
them
are
whites?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
likely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
the
rule
has
a
greater
impact
on
whites
than
on
anyone
else.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
rule,
instead
of
present
out
here,
was
any
employee
who
engaged
in
any
other
activity
which
occupied
a
significant
amount
of
his
time
would
be
required
to
take
a
leave
of
absence.
now,
i'm
not
speaking
now
of
the
campaigning,
i'm
speaking
of
his
serving
for
the
90
days
or
whatever
it
maybe
in
georgia
in
the
legislature.
would
you
say
that
rule
would
have
to
be
cleared
if
they
applied
it
to
people
who
wanted
to
take
three
months
off
to
go
to
the
university
or
three
months
off
to
sit
in
the
legislature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
doesn't
it
have
the
same
effect
on
this
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
rule
have
been
in
effect
since
1890,
let
us
say,
there
wouldn't
be
in
the
section
5
case
at
all,
would
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
have
relief
somewhere
else
you
would
suggest
but
you
wouldn't
have
any
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
then
abolish
the
rule
you
have
set
told
us
that
it
could
have
to
be
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
walters.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
dougherty
county,
georgia,
board
of
education
against
white
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
