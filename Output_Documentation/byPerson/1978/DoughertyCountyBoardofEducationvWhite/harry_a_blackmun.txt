the
duty
status,
while
he
was
serving
in
the
legislature?

those
are
arguments
that
you
make
to
the
congress
actually,
mr.
walters.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
they're
made
in
decisions
but
aren't
they
arguments
you
make
to
the
congress
rather
than
to
this
court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
i
didn't
imply
that
but
i
just
think
they're
policy
questions,
aren't
they,
basically,
despite
the
fact
that
justices
up
here
have
made
those
utterances?
