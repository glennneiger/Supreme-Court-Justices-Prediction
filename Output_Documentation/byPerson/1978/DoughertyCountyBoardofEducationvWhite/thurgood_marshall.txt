justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
charged
with
running
the
schools
under
the
state
and
under
the
laws
of
the
state,
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
state
and
the
state
superintendent
of
schools?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
is
running
under
the
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
walters,
do
you
see
any
difference
between
a
law
or
rule
which
says
that
any
county
officer
who
doesn't
work
won't
be
paid
and
a
rule
that
says
any
county
officer
who
doesn't
work
because
of
elections
would
not
be
paid?
they're
two
different
animals,
aren't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
need
the
additional
rule
to
limit
it
to
his
working
for
election?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
you
just
pass
a
rule
and
said
if
he
doesn't
do
his
work,
he
doesn't
get
paid.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
saying
it's
now
within
its
authority.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
could,
under
the
present
rules,
is
there
anything
that
prevent
a
person
in
this
man's
position
from
working
for
a
liquor
store?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
from
doing
anything
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
prevention
is
if
you
work
for
election.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
you
did
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
myer,
i
want
to
take
another
hypothetical.
if
georgia
passed
and
we
now
assumed
that
most
of
the
employees,
state
employees
are
white
in
georgia
for
the
purpose
of
this
question.
and
the
legislative
passed
an
act
saying
that,
no
state
employee
can
run
for
office,
wouldn't
that
have
to
be
cleared?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
isn't
also
true
that
attorney
general
might
learn
to
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
could
very
well
too
find.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
and
the
issue
is
whether
a
county
board
of
education
in
a
state
covered
by
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
must
seek
federal
approval
of
a
rule
requiring
its
employees
to
take
unpaid
leaves
of
absence
while
they
campaign
for
elective
office.
appellee,
a
negro
employee
of
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
announced
his
candidacy
for
the
georgia
house
of
representatives
in
may
of
1972.
less
than
a
month
later,
the
board
adopted
a
rule
requiring
its
employees
to
take
unpaid
leaves
of
absence
while
they're
a
candidate
for
elective
political
office.
as
a
result
of
the
rule,
appellee
was
forced
to
take
leave
while
seeking
election
to
the
georgia
house
in
1972,
1974
and
1976
and
lost
over
$11,000
in
salary.
when
compelled
to
take
his
certain
leave
of
absence,
he
brought
this
action
alleging
that
the
rule
58
was
unenforceable
because
it
had
not
been
precleared
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
the
district
court
of
the
district
columbia
as
required
by
section
5.
a
three-judge
district
court
concluded
that
the
rule
did
have
a
potential
for
discrimination
and
therefore
enjoined
his
enforcement
pending
compliance
as
rule
5.
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
rule
58
is
a
change
in
a
“standard
practice
and
procedure
with
respect
to
voting”
adopted
by
a
political
subdivision
subject
to
the
preclearance
requirements
of
section
5.
today's
conclusion
follows
directly
from
our
prior
decisions
mandating
approval
of
any
changes
that
affect
the
qualifications
or
ability
of
candidates
to
run
for
office.
by
imposing
substantial
disincentives
on
employees
and
seek
political
office,
rule
58
limits
entry
into
the
electoral
process
that
has
a
potential
of
limiting
the
choices
available
to
dougherty
county
voters.
in
effect,
the
rule
is
no
different
from
the
filing
fee
or
filing
date
changes
from
which
we
have
previously
required
preclearance.
although
the
board
does
not
in
itself
conduct
elections
or
vote
or
registration,
we
held
last
term
in
united
states
against
the
board
of
government
--
sheffield,
alabama
that
section
5
is
applicable
to
any
entity
that
exercise
control
over
the
electoral
process
by
attaching
a
price
tag
to
candidate's
participation.
the
board
has
made
clear
its
ability
to
exercise
power
over
elections
in
dougherty
county
thus
the
sheffield
case
is
dispositive
of
the
question
whether
the
board
is
indeed
a
political
subdivision
within
the
purview
of
section
5.
in
our
dissenting
today,
we
do
not
intimate
any
conclusion
on
the
ultimate
question
which
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
of
columbia
district
court
will
face
our
submission
of
the
rule
for
preclearance,
that
is,
whether
the
rule
in
fact
has
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
rather,
we
hold
only
that
because
rule
58
has
a
potential
from
such
discrimination
it
must
be
submitted
for
approval.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
therefore
affirmed.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
join.
mr.
justice
stewart
dissents
for
the
reasons
expressed
in
part
i
of
that
dissenting
opinion.
