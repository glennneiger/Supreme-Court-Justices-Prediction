justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
walters.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
white
as
i
understand
it,
was
assistant
coordinator
of
student
personnel
services.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
were
his
duties?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
board
had
a
coordinator
and
mr.
white
was
an
assistant.
how
many
other
assistants
were
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
not
essential
either
way,
i
understand.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
there
were
no
such
circumstances,
would
this
rule
58
have
to
be
pre-cleared?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
why
are
you
arguing
the
surrounding
circumstances?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
only
people
who'd
ever
announced
they
wish
to
run
had
been
white,
would
you
be
making
the
same
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
i
understand
that.i
was
putting
a
different
case
to
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you're
saying
that
discriminatory
intent
or
effect
is
immaterial
for
section
5
or
--?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
consider
bring
a
1983
suit
rather
than
proceeding
this
way?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
myer.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
i've
given
you
very
much
chance
to
argue
your
own
case,
i'll
ask
you
one
more
question
and
then
try
to
keep
quiet.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
this
goes
back
to
something
that
you
asked,
i
think
your
adversary
was
asked.
let's
assume
that
the
legislature
of
georgia
enacted
a
statute
of
general
application
to
all
state
employees
and
all
employees
of
local
subdivisions
of
the
state
that
said
in
substance
that,
while
any
such
employee
could
run
for
state
or
local
office,
that
if
one
did
and
wished
a
compensation
during
that
period,
he
would
have
to
work
at
least
half
time,
would
that
require
pre-clearance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
may
i
ask
you
a
second
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
another
question
to
follow
up
on
that
one
whether
it
violated
my
suggestion,
i
wouldn't
ask
you
too
many.
let's
assume
that
attorney
general
in
no
circumstances
decided
to
not
to
pre-clear.
in
other
words,
he
said,
georgia,
you
must
go
ahead
and
pay
these
people
while
they
work
at
all,
that
means
the
public
would
have
to
pay
for
people
who
run
for
office
regardless
of
whether
they
perform
any
services.
do
you
think
the
congress
of
the
united
states
intended
any
such
result?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
myer.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
the
option
that
you
mentioned
of
coming
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
really
a
feasible
option
for
a
small
school
board
or
a
small
board
of
health
in
el
paso,
texas,
for
example,
what
about
the
cost
in
time
and
the
delay?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
know
how
many
of
these
cases
are
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
this
year?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that
will
be
three
or
four
working
day
or
more,
wouldn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
think
it's
feasible
for
all
of
those
who
come
to
district
of
columbia.
i
know
they
have
the
right
under
law
and
i
know
congress
passed
it
and
you
didn't
but
you
said
it
was
feasible.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
myer,
let
me
ask
you
another
hypothetical,
it
appears
to
me.
what
if
the
sanitation
department
that's
in
charge
of
picking
up
garbage
around
the
city
and
it
often
employs
people
who've
been
precinct
captains
and
the
like
adopted
a
rule
that,
we
won't
pick
up
garbage
on
two
days
before
elections
so
we
can
get
out
and
circulate
in
the
precincts
and
frankly
the
reason
is
to
enable
people
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process.
i
assume
that
would
be
covered,
would
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
--
well,
forgetting
the
black
and
i
suppose
it
just
let
them
off
an
hour
to
vote,
they
hadn't
done
that
before,
the
sanitation
department
there.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
the
candidate,
opposing
candidate
feels
that
most
of
those
people
driving
the
trucks
would
have
to
vote
for
his
opponent
though.
i
suppose
he
could
challenge
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
this
is
a
--
do
you
think
this
is
about
as
far
as
section
5
has
been
stretched
in
the
sense
that
you're
frankly
saying
just
any
substantial
impact
on
the
possibility
of
somebody
running
for
office
is
covered.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
suppose
he'd
been
the
riches
man
in
the
county,
what
difference
would
it
have
made?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
this
case
decided
in
accordance
with
the
position
of
the
department,
the
hypotheticals
that
have
been
asked
and
answered
here
today
would
have
to
follow
this
precedent
without
regard
to
who
was
rich
and
who
was
poor
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
what
the
consequences
were.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
will
be
equally
obvious
if
they
only
required
25
cents,
wouldn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
the
attorney
general
has
to
pass
on
2000
of
this
a
year?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that
--
that
has
to
be
done
with
all
of
the
other
important
business
of
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
has
to
transact.
