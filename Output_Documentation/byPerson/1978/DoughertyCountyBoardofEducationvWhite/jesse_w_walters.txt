mr.
jesse
w.
walters
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
case
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia
and
involves
a
claim
that
a
statement,
what
we
submit
personnel
rule
of
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
was
not
adopted
in
conformity
with
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
and
therefore,
was
illegally
applied
to
john
white,
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
below.
now,
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
were
designed,
as
this
court
knows,
to
eliminate
racial
discrimination
in
voting
which
had
been
practiced
principally
in
some
southern
states.
so
far
as
we
believe
is
material
to
this
case
before
this
court,
section
5
of
that
act
provides
substantially
that
whenever
a
state
or
political
subdivision
shall
enact
or
seek
to
administer
any
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting
which
are
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
different
from
that
in
force
and
effect
on
november
1,
1964,
such
change
shall
not
be
utilized
or
implemented
until
either
a
judicial
determination
has
been
secured
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
that
the
change
does
not
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
denying
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
such
change
had
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
he
has
interposed
no
objection
thereto
within
60
days.
we
think
the
material
that
has
defined
in
the
act,
the
term
political
subdivision
means
any
county
or
parish,
except
that
where
registration
for
the
voting
is
not
conducted
under
the
supervision
of
a
county
or
parish,
the
terms
shall
include
any
other
subdivision
of
a
state
which
conducts
registration
for
voting.
in
may
of
1972,
john
white,
a
12-month
or
a
year
employee
on
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
made
known
to
the
board
of
education,
his
intention
on
to
offer
for
and
qualify
for
election
to
the
georgia
house
of
representatives.
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
had
no
policy
in
connection
with
its
employees
entering
the
political
arena
and
continuing
in
their
employment.
rule
58
was
therefore
adopted
by
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
and
it
provided
substantially
that
any
employee
who
became
a
candidate
for
elective
political
office
would
be
required
to
take
a
leave
of
absence
without
pay,
effective
upon
qualifying
for
election
to
such
office,
continuing
for
the
duration
of
the
candidacy
and
during
the
period
of
service
if
elected.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
mr.
justice
stewart,
chronologically,
mr.
white
made
known
his
intention
to
qualify
or
to
run
for
the
georgia
house
of
representative.
thereafter,
the
board
of
education
adopted
rule
58
and
thereafter
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
sir?
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
within
a
very
short
period
of
time,
yes,
your
honor
and
after
the
adoption
of
the
rule,
mr.
white
then
did
in
fact
qualify
for
election.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
chief
justice,
or
the
members
of
the
board
at
that
time,
no
employee
had
ever
run
for
public
office
or
qualified
to
run
for
public
office
prior
to
this
time.
now,
this
rule
was
not
submitted
or
cleared
through
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
or
through
the
attorney
general
simply
and
concisely
because
it
was
not
felt
that
it
was
a
rule
that
would
fall
within
the
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
shortly
after
the
adoption
of
rule
58,
mr.
white
qualified
for
election
to
the
georgia
house
of
representatives.
he
was
granted
a
leave
of
absence,
was
unsuccessful
in
a
democratic
primary
held
in
august
of
1962
and
was
promptly
thereafter
returned
to
a
duty
status
with
pay.
two
years
later,
mr.
white
again
qualified
for
election
to
the
georgia
house
of
representatives.
he
again
was
granted
a
leave
of
absence
without
pay,
this
time,
mr.
white
was
successful,
he
was
successful
in
the
a
democratic
primary
in
august,
was
successful
in
the
general
election
in
november
and
was
returning
to
a
duty
status
in
december,
on
the
1st
of
december
of
1974.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
do
not
believe
anyway
in
the
record
that
this
is
made
explicitly
clear.
i
will
state
for
the
court
that
mr.
white
was
on
a
leave
of
absence
without
pay
during
the
time
that
he
actually
was
serving
in
the
legislature.
the
rule
as
originally
written
provided
that
he
would
be
granted
a
leave
of
absence
without
pay
during
the
time
to
which
elected
or
after
election,
he
came
before
the
board.
the
board
modified,
this
is
not
the
record,
i
hasten
to
say,
the
board
modified
the
rule
so
as
to
not
to
make
it
effective
for
the
entire
two
years
but
just
during
the
time
that
he
was
away
in
the
legislature.
mr.
white
again,
in
1976
qualified
for
re-election
to
the
georgia
house
of
representatives.
he
again
was
granted
a
leave
of
absence
upon
qualification,
and
shortly
thereafter,
this
suit
was
instituted
by
mr.
white
seeking
among
other
things
to
have
rule
58
declared
in
violation
of
the
voting
rights
of
1965
with
the
view
of
compelling
the
board
to
reimburse
him
for
the
pay
that
he
had
contended
as
he
lost
while
on
leave
of
absence.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened,
both
parties
filed
motion
for
partially
summary
judgment
and
this
three-judge
court
hearing
the
matter
on
record
and
briefs,
held
that
rule
58,
was
in
fact
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
--
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
and
it
is
this
decision
that
brings
this
court
--
the
case
to
this
court.
we
submit
that
two
questions
are
submitted
to
this
court
by
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education.
first,
is
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education,
a
political
subdivision,
as
defined
in
the
act
or
as
established
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
so
as
to
be
covered
under
the
section
5
of
the
act?
second,
is
rule
58,
a
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting,a
standard
practice
of
procedure
with
respect
to
voting?
it
is
necessary
that
both
of
these
questions
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
in
order
for
the
decision
of
the
district
court
to
be
correct
and
it
is
submitted
that
the
answer
to
both
is
in
the
negative.
with
respect
to
the
first
question,
a
political
subdivision
is
defined
in
the
act
as
“any
county
or
parish
except
that
where
registration
for
voting
is
not
conducted
under
the
supervision
of
a
county
or
parish
the
term
shall
include
any
other
subdivision
of
a
state
which
conducts
registration
for
voting.”
dougherty
county
board
of
education
is
not
a
county
or
a
parish
nor
dougherty
conducts
registration
for
voting
and
clearly
it
does
not
fit
the
definition
of
a
political
subdivision
as
that
term
is
defined
in
the
act.
now,
admittedly
the
act
applies
specifically
to
the
state
of
georgia,
but
this
does
not
mean,
we
submit,
that
it
automatically
applies
to
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
even
though
that
board
is
a
public
body
or
a
public
or
a
political
subdivision,
not
under
the
terms
of
that
we
say
but
it
is
known
as
a
political
subdivision.
dougherty
county
board
of
education
is
a
creature
or
political
subdivision
on
state.
it
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
and
duty
of
operating
the
public
schools
of
dougherty
county,
nothing
more
and
nothing
less.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
--
it's
certainly
charged
with
the
responsibility
under
the
laws
of
the
state,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
i
doubt
very
seriously
that
the
pronouncement
of
the
state
school
superintendent
have
the
effect
of
laws
on
the
board
of
education
of
dougherty
county
georgia.
so,
in
the
other
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes
sir.
it
has
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
think
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes.
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
with
your
permission,
i
will
--
dougherty
county
board
of
education
had
no
responsibilities
or
duties
in
connection
with
elections,
it
cannot
change
the
location
of
a
polling
place
or
adopt
at
large
systems
of
election,
provide
for
the
appointment
of
previously
elected
officials.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
members
of
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
are
appointed
officials
and
any
change
in
the
method
of
election,
must
come
from
the
state
of
georgia.
the
board
cannot
enact
laws
regulating
candidacy,
voting
procedures,
annexations,
reapportionments,
redistricting,
or
otherwise
legislate
with
respect
to
any
feature
of
the
electoral
processes.
congress
did
not
intend
for
the
voting
rights
act
to
apply
to
a
political
subdivision
that
had
absolutely
no
function
in
relation
to
voting
in
elections.
every
decision
that
i've
been
able
to
find,
involving
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
involves
a
political
anarchy
that
had
powers
and
responsibilities
with
elections,
with
respect
to
the
election
processes.
there
must
be
this,
we
say
and
submit
to
this
court,
for
the
voting
rights
act
to
apply
to
apply
to
a
political
subdivision
and
this
must
be
real
responsibility,
real
duties,
real
powers,
not
imaginary
or
fanciful.
now,
the
case
of
united
states
versus
board
of
commissioners
of
sheffield,
alabama
does
in
fact
hold
that
a
political
subdivision
does
not
have
to
register
voters
to
become
a
covered
political
subdivision
under
section
5.
we
submit
though
that
it
is
essential
to
the
understanding
of
sheffield
to
look
closely
at
its
factual
situation.
the
city
of
sheffield,
alabama
on
november
1,
1964
was
governed
by
three
commissioners,
elected
by
the
city
at
large.
sometimes
during
the
year
1975,
sheffield
determined
to
submit
a
referendum
to
the
people
of
the
city
to
see
if
they
desired
to
change
the
form
of
government
to
a
mayor-council
form
consisting
of
a
mayor
and
eight
councilmen,
the
eight
councilmen
elected
at
large.
now,
bear
in
mind
here
that
the
city
of
sheffield
had
the
complete
responsibility,
the
complete
power
in
connection
with
this
election
even
though
they
did
not
register
voters.
the
city
of
sheffield,
the
referendum
was
submitted,
was
passed
and
the
city
of
the
sheffield
called
an
election
to
implement
the
new
form
of
government
and
to
elect
the
new
officials.
the
united
states
filed
a
suit
contending
that
this
was
a
change
which
should
have
been
either
cleared
through
the
district
court
of
columbia
or
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
asking
an
injunction.
a
three-judge
court,
dismissed
the
proceeding,
finding
unanimously
that
the
city
of
sheffield
was
not
a
political
subdivision
as
defined
in
the
act.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
thank
you.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
believe
that
when
we
recessed
on
yesterday
afternoon,
i
was
discussing
with
the
court
the
sheffield
case
that
arose
in
sheffield,
alabama.
i
believe
that
i
had
justified
the
court
that
a
three-judge
district
court
had
unanimously
ruled
that
the
city
of
sheffield
did
not
fall
within
the
definition
of
a
political
subdivision
as
defined
in
the
voting
rights
act.
and
this
court,
in
a
split
decision
reversed
the
district
court
and
as
i
read
and
understand
the
majority
opinion,
this
court
is
holding
in
effect
that
any
political
entity
that
has
power
over
some
aspect
or
any
aspect
of
the
electoral
processes
within
a
designated
jurisdiction
is
covered
by
the
act.
now,
i
really
don't
know
that
i
have
any
real
basic
quarrel
with
the
decision
of
this
court,
but
i
do
say
that
it
becomes
necessary
to
review
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
under
the
decision
in
sheffield
and
inquire
as
to
whether
or
not
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
does
in
fact
have
any
power
over
any
aspect
of
the
electoral
process
in
dougherty
county,
georgia.
it
is
submitted
that
the
answer
to
this
inquiry
is
in
the
negative.
there
are
many
political
subdivisions
in
the
state
of
georgia
that
have
no
control,
no
power,
nothing
to
do
with
the
electoral
processes,
and
we
say
that
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
is
one
of
these.and
others
would
be
hospital
authorities,
payroll
development
authorities,
county
boards
of
health
and
the
like.
none
of
whom
have
any
function
whatsoever
in
connection
with
the
political
processes.
in
the
absence
of
control
or
power
over
the
electoral
process,
neither
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
or
any
other
entity
which
has
no
responsibility
or
control,
respecting
election
is,
we
submit,
required
to
seek
the
approval
of
federal
authority
on
a
purely
and
simply
personnel
matter.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
the
state
legislature
passed
such
a
law,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
--
white.
yes
sir,
because
the
state
has
the
power
over
the
electoral
process.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
white,
that
if
the
legislature
delegated
that
decision
to
the
board,
then
the
board
would
have
power
over
the
electoral
process.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
if
the
state
law
gave
to
the
school
board
such
power
over
the
electoral
process,
under
the
sheffield
decision,
i
would
say
that
the
board
would
be
a
covered
subdivision.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes,
i
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
white.
simply
and
concisely,
maybe
such
school
official
or
school
employee
would
have
some
other
course
of
action
but
i
do
not
believe
so
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
because
i'll
go
back
to
the
question
that
i
do
not
believe,
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
well,
of
course,
mr.
justice
white,
in
response
to
that,
i
would
have
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
know
of
no
guaranteed
federal
right
or
state
right
that
said
a
man
in
entitled
to
a
position
with
the
board
of
education.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
would
say
that
the
state
being
a
covered
subdivision
under
the
act
and
specifically
under
section
4
(b)
of
the
act
and
under
the
attorney
general's
designation
of
the
state
of
georgia
as
being
covered
by
the
act
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
and
then
i
think
if
the
state
of
georgia
did
that
and
delegated
that
power
to
the
school
boards,
then
the
school
board
would
be
exercising
control
over
some
part
of
the
electoral
process.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
well,
of
course,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
in
response
to
that
inquiry
that
the
question
would
arise
as
to
whether
or
not
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia,
and
frankly
and
truthfully,
i
do
not
believe
that
there's
any
law
in
the
state
of
georgia
that
gives
to
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
or
any
other
board
of
education
any
control
over
any
aspect
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
would
certainly
say
that
in
response
to
that
that
it
may
be
but
this
suit
was
brought
and
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
if
--
if
the
board
of
education
was
charged
under
the
state
law
with
the
responsibility
of
having
some
control
or
power
over
the
electoral
process,
it's
then
i
would
have
to
say,
under
the
decision
in
sheffield,
even
though
they
may
not
register
voters
that
they
would
be
a
covered
subdivision,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
not
in
my
opinion,
no
sir.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
no
sir,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
rule
58
is
anything
other
a
personnel
rule.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
no
sir
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
think
i
mean
it
to
the
merits
of
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
an
employee
of
the
board
of
education
went
to
register
for
the
elective
office
of
the
house
of
representatives,
he
would
not
be
asked
the
question,
are
you
getting
a
leave
of
absence
from
the
board
of
education?
he
would
not
be
asked
anything.
he
would
automatically
be
qualified
and
would
be
permitted
to
run.
now,
the
question
then
arises,
may
it
please
your
honor,
as
to
whether
or
not
after
he
does
this,
after
he
said,
i
am
running,
i
am
offering
for
the
office
of
the
georgia
house
of
representatives,
then,
as
to
whether
the
board
of
education
who
has
contracted
with
this
man
for
his
services
for
a
12-month
period
has
the
right
to
demand
that
this
person
fulfill
his
contract
which
he
previously
entered
into.
and
we
submit
that
this
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
voting.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
think
it
certainly
if
the
issue
is
to
whether
or
not
the
rule
is
a
standard
practice
of
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes,
because
the
state
legislature
could
say,
before
you
qualify
for
office.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes,
i
think
so
because
as
i
said,
the
state
of
georgia
is
specifically
designated
under
section
4
(b)
of
the
act
and
by
the
attorney
general
of
state.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
it
does
have
absolute
control
in
georgia
over
the
elections.
the
dougherty
county
board
of
education
cannot
enact
any
regulation
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes
sir,
but
we
say
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
no
sir,
i
do
not
believe
that
there's
any
question
of
its
power
to
adopt
reasonable
rules
and
regulations
pertaining
to
its
employees.
no,
i
do
not
believe
there's
any.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
no
sir.
i
would
not
construe
that
as
being
a
voting
rule
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
would
not,
your
honor,
because
again,
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
fact
that
i
concede
that
the
state
of
georgia
does
have
control
over
the
electoral
process.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
no
sir,
if
i
understood
mr.
justice
renhquist's
inquiry,
it
would
not
be
a
rule
pertaining
to
a
standard
practice
--.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
but
it
would
be
a
rule
pertaining
as
to
whether
or
not
that
man
was
paid
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
no
sir,
not
in
my
judgment.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
no
sir,
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
no
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
had
no
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
if
i
may
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
think
that
this
would
have
been,
mr.
justice
marshall,
a
answer
to
this
without
litigation.
and
i
think
that
the
board
of
education
would
have
been
properly
within
its
powers
and
authorities
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes
sir,
but
i
say
i
think
they
would
have
been
properly
within
their
powers
if
mr.
white,
upon
election,
and
not
serving
any
job
for
which
he
had
contracted
to
have
terminated
his
employment
without
any
rule,
without
any
regulation.
but
the
board,
i
think,
chose
to
deal
with
this
matter
in
a
more
reasonable
and
moderate
fashion.
and
they
prescribed
simply
and
concisely
the
--
how
a
man
could
enter
the
political
arena
and
continue
in
his
employment
with
the
board
of
education.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
is
there
anything
that
prevents
him
from
working
for
a
liquor
store?
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
the
rule
that
would
prevent
him
from
work
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
well,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
the
board,
when
a
contract
with
an
employee
are
entitled
to
expect
his
full
attention
and
full
time
to
the
duties
he
is
contracted
to
perform.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes
i
am,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
and
this
maybe
true
but
i
--
that
we
--
i
think
we
needed
a
rule
to
show
that
it
would
have
spelled
out
to
any
employee
then
or
in
the
future.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes
sir,
i
am
contending
that
it
was
not
a
change.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes,
i
think
that
the
legal
decision
in
a
three-judge
court
hold
a
point
(voice
overlap)
with
my
expectation
of
the
electoral
process.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
and
i
ask
this
question
myself,
what
modification
and
what
change?
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
now,
the
lower
court
decision
says
and
if
i
may
quote
about
imposing
a
financial
laws
on
its
employees
who
choose
to
become
candidates,
it
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
participate
in
the
democratic
process
and
consequently
restricts
the
field
from
which
the
voters
may
select
their
representatives.
now,
this
i
think,
is
the
holding
of
the
lower
court,
and
if
this
is
what
they
say,
is
the
modification
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
correct,
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
his
duties
were
counseling
of
students,
selecting
their
--
maybe
their
curriculum,
principally
counseling
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
powell,
i
could
certainly
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
but
i
do
not
know
how
many
others
there
were
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
alright.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
would
like
to
with
the
court's
permission.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
we'd
gone
forefeel
and
i
think
had
i
said
listening
that
if
we
ask
ourselves
one
question
suppose
the
rule
58
had
simply
and
concisely
provided
that
if
elected
you
will
take
a
leave
of
absence
while
you
are
in
atlanta,
georgia
in
the
legislature
earning
another
salary
from
another
governmental
unit.
would
anyone
seriously
contend
that
that
rule
was
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
or
would
it
be
obvious
on
its
face
that
it
was
a
rule,
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
employment
of
the
board
of
education?
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
well,
i
misunderstood
the
question
mr.
justice
white
and
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
if
i
did
i
would
retract
my
answer
and
i
would
not
say
it
was
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
and
unless
it
is
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
there
would
be
covered
entity,
yes
sir,
but
all
state
law
is
just
because
it
have
covered
entity
do
not
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
they
have
to
be
a
state
--
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
oh
i
would
have
to
answer
that,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
the
board
of
education
of
dougherty
county
could
not
--
could
not.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
would
say,
yes.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
because
this
is
not
--
it
does
not
increase
anything.
it
says
to
a
member
who
is
contracted
to
perform
services
for
dougherty
county.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
of
course
it's
not
in
the
record
and
no
one
had
said
anything
about
it.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
what
about
$500.00
a
year
that
mr.
white
had
been
making
from
this
state
legislature
for
his
45
days
service
not
even
mr.
white's
counsel
contend
that
they
are
entitled
to
recover
the
money
for
a
leave
of
absence
while
he
was
there
and
this
is
an
employment
practice,
no
voting
practice
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
submit.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
now,
i
would
say
in
conclusion
that
in
my
judgment,
the
other
limits
of
the
applicability
of
the
voting
rights
have
been
already
reached
and
i
said
that
the
restrictions
imposed
by
the
voting
rights
act
on
a
limited
number
of
selected
southern
states
are
unique
in
the
history
of
this
nation.
and
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
has
said
that
the
pre-clearance
requirement
of
the
act
is
a
substantial
departure
from
ordinary
concepts
of
federal
system,
if
encroachment
upon
state
sovereignties
is
significant
and
undeniable.
another
has
recently
said
that
there's
a
need
to
bring
a
common
sense
approach
to
its
applicability
or
application.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
no
sir,
i
think
these
are
statements
that
have
been
made
in
decisions,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
well,
i
certainly
hope
it
would
say
that
i
certainly
do
not
intend
to
make
an
argument
and
it
is
not
proper
before
the
court
and
i
would
respond
in
that.
mr.
jesse
w.
walters
well,
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
a
common
sense
approach
to
an
act
of
congress
and
to
a
construction
of
an
act
of
congress
is
a
significant
factor
in
a
judicial
determination
of
the
intent
of
that
act
and
i
would
say
that
a
common
sense,
after
all
said
and
done
and
all
the
record
is
over,
a
common
sense
look
at
rule
58
will
reveal
that
it
is
not
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
as
congress
intended.
congress,
i
do
not
believe
intended
for
a
situation
such
as
this
where
you
have
to
come
to
washington
to
get
clearance.
thank
you,
your
honor.
