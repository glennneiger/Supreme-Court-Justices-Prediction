mr.
goldmark
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
also
the
amended
complaint.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wasn't
what
i
wanted
to
ask.
aside
from
that,
is
there
any
other
marker
that
we
can
find
that
shows
the
interest
that
the
state
has
in
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
says
he
can
come
here
and
give
us
then.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
it
seems
like
most
party
political
troubles
that
via
the
most
states
that
they
settle
within
the
convention
politically
in
washington
they
settle
them
in
courts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that's
the
difference
from
other
states
where
you'd
vote
it
down
and
not
politically?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
we'll
be
supervising
the
parties
eventually.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
go
to
the
legislature
and
change
the
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
wasn't
that
act
passed
by
political
parties?
or
they
have
nonpartisan
elections
in
