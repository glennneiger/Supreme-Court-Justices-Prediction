justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
convention
decided
would
be
--
initial
committee
should
be
composed
of
two
members
from
each
candidate,
but
the
legislator
then
said
“oh
no,
the
central
committee
should
be
selected
on
a
population
basis.”
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
status
of
that
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
could
the
statute
say
this?“
the
party
central
committee
shall
be
composed
on
the
following
ten
people.”
and
then
list
an
accountant,
a
lawyer,
an
engineer
and
just
list
ten
people.
it
doesn't
say
they
have
to
be
from
anywhere,
it
just
says
“that's
going
to
be
the
governing
body
of
the
party.”
would
that
be
unconstitutional
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
does.
it
does.
it
decides
that
it
wants
that
it
wants
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
wants
two
lawyers
and
two
--
i
suppose
right
down
the
list
of
them,
two
of
everybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
the
state
can
impose
the
duty
on
the
party
if
the
party
doesn't
want
to
perform?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
suppose
it
can
prevent
the
party
from
doing
something
that
the
party
wants
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
there
some
law
of
washington
or
under
the
constitution
that
would
--
if
you
don't
like
the
rules
about
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party
in
washington,
there's
no
reason
you
can't
form
another
one.
form
another
party
and
run
it
the
way
you
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
because
you
--
i
know
because
you
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
the
provision
for
getting
candidates
on
the
ballot.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
there
anything
in
the
washington
law
that
would
prevent
the
convention
from
forming
a
committee
whatever
you
wanted
it
do
to
perform
all
the
functions
that
the
convention
wanted
it
to
perform
except
the
ones
that
the
statute
says
the
central
committee
has
to
perform?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
in
so
far
as
--
so
that
you
think
the
issue
really
is
here
whether
or
not
it's
constitutional
for
the
state
to
say
that
the
committee
that
--
that
the
central
committee
that
is
to
perform
these
five
functions
have
to
be
two
from
each
county?
that's
the
--
you
think
that's
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
it
to
perform
these
particular
functions.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
you
say
that's
really
the
only
issue
that's
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
party
could
provide
for
--
under
the
statute
that
the
party
could
have
all
the
other
functions
that
the
state
committee
might
be
given
to
perform.
it
could
be
assigned
to
another
committee.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
--
you
say
that
under
this
--
under
the
washington
law,
the
--
while
there
must
be
a
central
committee
with
two
members
from
each
county,
the
convention
could
remove
--
could
say
if
the
committee
has
no
functions?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
will
set
up
another
committee
to
do
all
the
things
they
want
them
to
do,
and
will
have
this
committee
composed
any
way
they
wanted
to?
