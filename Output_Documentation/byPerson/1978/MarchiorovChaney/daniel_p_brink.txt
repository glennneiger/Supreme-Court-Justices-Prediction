mr.
daniel
p.
brink
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court.
i
think
to
understand
the
question,
we
do
have
to
go
back
into
the
background
of
the
system,
the
political
structure
of
the
state
of
washington
and
the
governmental
structure.
it's
been
of
--
we're
still
fairly
young
state,
but
of
some
70
years
duration
has
there
been
this
structure
of
39
counties
with
39
separate
governments
each
having
their
own
elected
representatives,
excuse
me,
legislative
executive
in
judicial
branches.
they
elect
their
own
county
judges,
the
county
commissioners
and
executives,
prosecuting
attorneys,
county
clerks
and
so
on
down
the
line.
the
state
has
authorized
by
a
section
just
one
following
this,
and
in
the
same
basic
enabling
act
in
1907,
the
existence
of
county
committees
which
are
composed
of
precinct
committee
men
elected
in
each
county.
these
organizations
of
course
parallel
the
county
governments.
then
the
county
committee
of
each
county
selects
two
members
to
the
state
committee.
it
originally
was
just
one
in
1907,
and
1927
as
i
recall,
they
added
the
rights
of
one
man
or/and
one
woman
from
each
county.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
the
state
legislature,
yes
your
honor.
the
powers
of
the
county
committee
are
not
restricted
by
statute.
and
when
it
is
stated
here
that
there
can
be
no
other
organization
speaking
for
the
democratic
party,
that
is
simply
not
true.
each
county
speaks
for
itself
and
sometimes
most
vociferously
and
they're
not
always
in
concert.
however,
the
state
charter
attempted
to
put
the
counties
in
line
a
little
bit
and
did
say
that
they
do
have
a
limitation
upon
them,
and
that
is
that
they
should
attempt
at
least
to
follow
the
policy
set
forth
in
the
national
charter,
the
state
--
excuse
me,
the
national
platform,
the
state
platform
and
the
county
platform.
the
state
committee
as
i
said
was
--
is
elected
by
the
--
composed
of
these
people
from
the
county
committees,
two
from
each,
and
just
provides
a
skeleton
of
the
state
party
and
as
an
administrative,
not
an
electoral
and
not
a
policy
making
body.
the
policy
making
is
reserved
to
the
state
convention.
the
charter
itself
requires
the
state
committee
to
follow
the
policies
set
forth
by
the
state
convention
and
by
the
state
charter.
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
functions
of
the
state
committee
are
relatively
limited.
we
--
i'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
what
it
does
and
what
it
does
not
do.
it
does
not
do
a
lot
of
the
things
represented
by
counsel.
by
statute,
it
comes
into
being
every
--
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
its
powers,
by
statute,
are
limited
to
those.
however
it
has
been
assigned
additional
functions
by
the
state
convention.
and
in
further
answer
to
that
your
honor,
the
state
convention
can
of
course
assign
additional
committees
to
do
additional
things.
the
state
convention
is
all
powerful
in
the
view
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court
in
any
event.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
i
do
not
believe
there
to
be
a
federal
issue
because
i
do
not
believe
there
to
be
a
--
an
infringement
at
all
upon
anybody's
rights
to
associate.
the
state
committee
does
not
nominate
candidates.
it
does
not
even
endorse
candidates.
it
does
not
participate
in
the
election
process,
it
simply
the
administrative
function
to
try
to
glue
these
39
counties
together
to
provide
communication
one
to
the
other.
it
is
our
position
as
appellees
that
there
is
no
issue
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
of
course
our
position.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
i
will
attempt
to.
the
state
legislature
has
been
requested
in
the
past
on
several
occasions
in
the
last
10
years
to
change
this
composition
make
up
of
the
state
committee.
this
legislature
which
is
made
up
by
one
man
one
vote
basis
has
declined
to
do
so.
in
fact,
it
hasn't
even
considered
the
--
been
strongly
enough
to
pass
from
one
house
to
the
other.
i
don't
know
how
i
can
answer
you
question
further
if
you
--
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
correct
that
they
can
do
so
that
they
could
form
a
committee
for
fund
raising.
they
could
form
a
--
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
if
the
legislature
said
it
should
be
two
from
each
county
and
--
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
yes,
just
these
limited
functions.
that
does
not
impinge
upon
anybody's
rights
of
association
or
expression.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
that
is
to
us
the
only
issue
that
is
here.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
it
can
and
in
fact
they
have
set
up
a
judicial
committee
by
the
charter.
they
did
not
set
up
the
separate
finance
committee
that
has
--
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
that
is
not
very
broad
in
view
of
the
king
county
republican
case
in
which
the
washington
state
supreme
court
said
that
subject
to
the
overriding
power
of
the
state
convention.
so
i
suspect
the
legislature
went
and
said
inherent
just
saying
“well,
do
whatever
you
can.”
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
absolutely,
that
is
the
holding
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court
back
at
1971
in
king
county
republican
case.
i
--
this
court
has
not
so
far,
as
we
can
tell,
gone
so
far
--
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
they
could
theoretically
do
that
in
our
view.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
right,
but
they
must
allow
the
state
central
committee
as
set
up
by
statute
to
exist
to
attempt
to
coordinate
at
least
the
election
procedures
of
the
39
different
counties
and
their
own
county
committees.
and
it
does
provide
an
element
of
stability
between
conventions.
it
is
there.
it
is
official.
the
secretary
of
state
knows
he
can
call
up
the
state
chairman
or
the
--
of
either
party
and
plan
ahead
for
conventions.
this
is
the
most
important
function,
seems
to
me,
of
the
state
committee.
and
that
is
to
initiate
the
election
procedures
by
calling
conventions,
setting
dates,
heading
the
precinct
committee
men
and
their
various
precincts.
they
set
the
dates
for
precinct
caucuses,
for
county
caucuses
and
then
for
the
state
convention.
but
as
also
limited
by
statute,
they
can't
tell
the
state
convention
what
to
do
in
its
own
convention.
the
case
that
this
court
has
cited
to
of
kasper
versus
pontikes
and
cousins
versus
wigoda
are
just
so
far
and
away
from
what
we're
involved
in
here.
those
were
--
cousins
versus
wigoda
involved
a
national
political
party
convention
and
as
to
which
delegation
from
the
state
of
illinois
should
be
seated,
the
one
that
was
elected
under
the
state
law
or
the
one
that
was
selected
in
accordance
with
rules
of
the
national
convention.
and
the
state
did
attempt
to
interfere
and
this
court
said
it
was
an
interference.
but
that
was
a
national
convention
case.
the
court
was
very
concerned
and
well
it
should
be,
it's
of
importance
to
all
parties,
all
citizens
that
this
convention
be
held
without
interference
from
50
states.
it's
also,
in
the
case
of
kasper
versus
pontikes,
that
was
a
nomination
case
and
a
state
little
again
from
the
state
of
illinois,
and
where
an
illinois
statute
prevented
appellee
from
voting
in
the
democratic
primary
because
she
had
within
23
months
previous,
voted
in
a
republican
primary.
now
the
washington
state
committee
does
not
affect
at
all
primary
elections.
it
does
not
permit,
prevent,
deprived
anyone
from
participating
in
primary
or
general
elections.
the
ripon
society
case
is
simply
not
in
point
again.
a
national
convention
case
in
which
the
republican
--
and
an
also
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
case.
there's
no
fourteenth
amendment
issue
here
nor
is
there
one
raised
here.
the
--
assuming
that
there
would
be
any
kind
of
a
burden
upon
the
appellants,
there
is
a
state
interest
in
maintaining
the
stability
and
integrity
and
continuity
of
the
major
political
parties
in
the
state.
to
become
a
major
political
party
in
washington
state
by
getting
10%
of
the
vote
at
the
last
general
election,
and
then
if
the
new
party,
new
major
party
is
still
in
being
it
can
qualify
for
the
primary
ballot
without
a
separate
convention.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
--
i
think
the
only
time
we
had
a
party
that
achieved
this
was
the
progressive
party
back
in
1948,
and
then
of
course
by
the
year
1950,
nobody
was
interested
to
pick
up
the
fact
that
they
were
a
major
party.
so
they
--
we
have
a
lot
of
minor
parties
that
come
and
go
and
a
lot
of
them
on
the
ballot.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
progressive
party,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
they
got
enough
vote
to
qualify
for
the
next
time.
mr.
daniel
p.
brink
didn't
follow
through.
the
state
committee
is
not
the
policy
maker,
but
it
is
important
that
it
retain
communications
and
maintain
communications
between
these
county
organizations
who
are
all
out
speaking
for
their
selves
--
themselves
as
well.
it
has
the
same
constituency
as
those
county
committees.
we
suggest
the
statute
is
narrowly
drawn
and
serves
a
state
interest
to
maintain
this
continuity
of
the
major
parties.
it
is
our
suggestion
that
the
court
affirm
the
washington
state
supreme
court.
thank
you.
