mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
washington
statute
revised
code
of
washington
29.42.020
regulates
the
state
committee
of
washington's
major
political
parties.
one
requirement
of
this
statute
is
that
these
state
committees
be
composed
of
two
persons
from
each
county
in
the
state
no
more,
no
less
and
none
other.
the
issue
presented
here
is
whether
this
requirement
that
the
state
committees
be
composed
of
two
persons
per
county
no
more,
no
less
and
none
other
can
be
constitutionally
applied
to
bar
the
democratic
party
of
washington
from
establishing
its
state
committee
composed
of
two
persons
from
each
county,
plus
one
person
from
each
legislative
district
in
the
state.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
correct
we
do
not
challenge
that
requirement
here.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
my
knowledge
they
did
not.
appellants
challenge
here
only
the
two-person
per
county
requirement
and
the
court
below
ruled
that
this
provision
was
severable
from
the
remainder
of
the
statute.
appellants
are
eight
members
and
officers
of
the
washington
democratic
party.
four
of
them
were
persons
elected
as
legislative
district
representatives
to
the
democratic
state
committee
and
denied
their
seats
on
the
basis
of
the
challenge
statute.
appellees
are
the
democratic
state
committee
and
its
chairman
at
the
time
this
suit
was
instituted.
the
state
of
washington
was
served,
as
required
by
state
law,
with
a
copy
of
the
complaint
when
this
litigation
began
and
notified
of
the
appeal
for
the
washington
supreme
court.
it
has
not
appeared
at
any
stage
in
this
proceeding.
the
democratic
state
committee
is
the
governing
body
of
the
washington
democratic
party.
in
1970,
the
washington
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
king
county
republican
central
committee
versus
republican
state
committee
interpreted
the
authority
of
state
committees
regulated
by
rcw
29.42.020.
the
court
ruled
there
that
these
party
state
committees
have
the
inherent
power
to
govern
the
statewide
operations
of
parties
as
political
organizations
subject
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
between,
subject
only
to
the
overriding
authority
of
the
party
state
convention.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
they
only
govern
between
conventions.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
i'm
not
aware,
your
honor.
the
statute
authorizes
that
party
state
committees
to
call
conventions
and
to
plan
them.
it
specifically
precludes
them
from
setting
rules
to
govern
the
operations
of
the
convention.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
stewart
it
is
not
freely
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
let
us
begin.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
democratic
party
has
been
characterized
in
the
king
county
republican
central
committee
case
as
a
voluntary
political
association.
that
association
has
the
right
to
establish
a
governing
body.
whether
the
statute
that
regulates
what
that
governing
body
does
actually
creates
it,
regulates
it
or
as
i
believe
the
court
also
said
in
that
case,
gives
it
statutory
body
in
being
may
only
be
matters
of
terminology
because
it
seems
clear
that
this
is
a
voluntary
association
and
this
regulation
regulates
the
way
in
which
it
can
do
certain
functions.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
1970
decision
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
statement
of
the
washington
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
statement
of
the
washington
supreme
court
interpreting
this
statute
was
that
the
party
state
committee
had
inherent
power,
not
statutory
power,
but
inherent
power
to
govern
the
statewide
operations
of
a
party
as
a
political
organization.
and
that
is
a
quote
from
the
court's
decision.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
they
are
created
by
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
to
appellant's
knowledge,
they
are
regulated
in
approximately
32
states.
twenty
of
those
merely
reference
the
existence
of
a
state
committee
and
leave
the
composition
to
the
party's
choice.
four
of
them
establish
a
minimum
number
but
allow
the
remainder
to
be
added
by
the
party.
fourteen,
mandate
that
the
party
state
committee
shall
be
composed
on
the
basis
of
one
person
one
vote.
twelve,
like
washington,
set
an
absolute
figure.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
not
to
my
knowledge.
in
a
number
of
instances,
congressional
district
organizations
for
example,
are
entitled
to
elect
the
representatives
to
the
state
committee,
or
legislative
district
organizations.
not
all
are
county
based,
but
most
have
a
constituency
of
some
kind
like
a
county.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
blackmun,
he
has
not.
appellants
served
the
attorney
general
with
a
copy
of
their
complaint
when
the
suit
began,
and
notified
him
of
the
appeal
to
the
washington
supreme
court.
he
is
not
here
at
any
state
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
he
was
also
served
with
a
copy
of
our
--
of
the
appellant's
amended
complaint
and
of
the
--
and
the
notice
of
the
appeal
from
the
trial
court
to
the
washington
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
he
has
never
appeared.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
appellants
are
not
aware
of
any
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
brennan,
yes
i
did.
the
washington
declaratory
judgment
statute
requires
the
attorney
general
to
be
served
in
any
suit
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
add
in
further
response
to
the
question
from
mr.
justice
stewart
that
even
if
the
statute
is
the
sole
power
that
gives
this
committee
being,
it
is
clear
that
the
functions,
the
statute
requires
that
committee
to
perform
are
protected
by
freedom
of
association.
the
statute
authorizes
and
requires
that
committee
to
call
and
plan
state
party
conventions.
that
is
an
activity
protected
by
freedom
of
association.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
statute
requires
the
democratic
state
committee
to
provide
for
election
of
delegates
to
the
democratic
national
--
to
a
national
party
convention.
as
this
court
knows
from
the
case
of
cousins
versus
wigoda,
the
power
within
a
party
to
provide
for
the
election
of
delegates
to
national
convention
is
considered
to
be
extraordinarily
political
and
a
vital
matter
within
that
party.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
a
major
political
party
is
one
that
received
5%
or
more
of
the
total
vote
cast
in
any
proceeding
statewide
election.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
major
benefit
of
being
a
major
political
party
is
that
you
are
allowed
to
participate
in
the
state's
primary
system.
minor
political
parties
must
hold
state
conventions
in
order
to
place
their
candidates
in
the
general
election
ballot.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
record
does
not
show,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
that
would
be
my
assumption.
this
statute,
the
state
of
washington
has
had
statutes
regulating
the
composition
of
party
state
committees
since
1907.
if
the
democratic
party
in
washington
is
like
other
political
parties
in
american
history,
it
was
a
voluntary
political
association
up
until
the
end
of
about
the
1890's
when
as
the
court
will
recall,
there
were
abuses
enough
in
primary
election
systems
and
other
areas
to
cause
states
to
gradually
bring
political
parties
within
their
regulatory
power.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
stewart,
perhaps
i
could
explain
further
the
ruling
the
court
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
charter
enacted
by
the
democratic
party,
which
may
further
shed
light
on
your
concern.
that
charter
was
adopted
by
the
democratic
state
convention
in
1976.
the
charter
is
contained
in
the
party's
joint
appendix,
to
establish
the
democratic
party's
permanent
statewide
organization.
article
4
(g)
of
that
charter
states
that
the
democratic
state
committee
shall
be
the
governing
party
--
body
of
the
party
while
the
convention
is
in
adjournment.
in
the
decision
below,
the
washington
supreme
court
held
that
the
democratic
state
convention
as
the
supreme
party
authority
is
implicitly
empowered.
it
did
not
say
empowered
by
statute,
but
implicitly
empowered
to
establish
the
party's
permanent
statewide
political
organization,
and
to
delegate
authority
within
that
organization.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
democratic
state
convention,
meaning
the
1976
adopted
the
charter.
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
washington
supreme
court
could've
held
that
the
washington
democratic
state
convention
was
implicitly
empowered
to
establish
the
party's
permanent
statewide
organization,
and
to
delegate
authority
within
that
organization.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
for
example
your
honor,
if
the
democratic
state
convention
adopted
a
party
platform
which
the
state
committee
then
refused
to
implement
that
would
be
a
very
substantial
burden
on
the
party's
freedom
of
association.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
because
that
is
its
inherent
function.
it
is
as
you'll
notice
clause
5
of
this
statute
authorizes
the
state
committee
to
perform
all
inherent
functions
of
such
organization.
and
in
the
court
in
the
decision
below,
the
court
held
that
the
democratic
party
state
convention
is
implicitly
empowered
to
establish
its
permanent
statewide
party
organization
and
delegate
authority
within
it,
and
that
was
the
statutory
state
committee.
the
court
below
held
that
the
democratic
party
charter
is
binding
authority
on
the
democratic
state
committee
absent
valid
state
law
to
the
contrary.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
a
political
party
is
an
organization
established
to
influence
policy
and
to
win
elections.
the
only
permanent
statewide
organization
that
members
of
the
democratic
party
have,
the
only
organization
to
carry
this
out
between
conventions
is
the
democratic
state
committee.
if
this
committee
does
not
implement
the
party
platforms,
raise
money
as
the
record
shows
it
does,
raises
money
for
democratic
candidates
and
distributes
money
to
those
candidates.
if
the
committee
does
not
perform
these
functions
as
the
convention
desires,
that
would
be
a
very
substantial
burden
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
state
central
committee
is
under
the
common
law
of
the
state
under
this
statute,
and
under
the
party's
charter
its
governing
body.
if
the
democratic
party
attempted
to
establish
some
other
organization,
appellants
have
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
denounced
as
an
illegal
body.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
suggesting
that
this
is
the
party's
permanent
statewide
organization.
it
has
the
authority.
when
the
democratic
state
committee
speaks
on
an
issue,
it
speaks
with
the
authority
of
the
democratic
party.
it
elects
the
party's
chairman
or
elects
that
state
chairman.
when
he
speaks,
he
speaks
with
the
authority
of
the
democratic
party.
for
the
convention
to
establish
some
other
body
would
not
only
be
contrary
to
state
law,
it
would
be
extraordinarily
divisive
with
the
party.
this
is
the
group
that
leads
this
party.
party
members
have
no
other
organization
to
look
to
for
this
function.
the
record
is
clear
that
this
state
committee
raises
and
distributes
money
to
party
candidates,
passes
resolutions
and
performs
all
the
normal
functions
of
the
governing
body
of
a
political
party.
four
of
appellants
were
elected
as
members
to
serve
and
participate
in
its
decisions
and
have
been
denied
from
doing
so
on
the
basis
of
this
statutory
requirement.
and
there
is
no
evidence
anywhere
in
the
record
of
any
compelling
state
interest
of
the
state
of
washington
that
justifies
the
implicitness
of
such
a
burden.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
i
do
not
believe
that
that
organization
had
its
genesis
in
a
voluntary
private
association.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
your
honor,
appellants
believe
as
the
washington
supreme
court
has
said,
and
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i'll
read
its
statement
that
appears
on
page
5
of
appellee's
brief
in
which
the
washington
supreme
court
stated
the
powers
of
the
state
committees,
and
stated
their
role
in
under
this
statute.
representative
of
a
permanent
state
party
organization,
those
subordinate
to
the
overriding
power
of
the
party
state
convention.
so
the
two
were
linked
and
the
state
convention
has
power
over
this
body.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
it
is
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
is
a
state
committee
created
by
rcw
29.42.020,
as
a
committee
designed
to
function
on
a
statewide
level,
it
is
necessarily
invested
with
the
inherent
power
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations
for
its
own
internal
government,
as
well
as
to
promulgate
subject
to
the
overriding
authority
of
the
state
convention.
intraparty
rules
governing
statewide
operations
of
the
party
as
a
political
organization
during
the
interval
between
conventions.
for
this
reason,
appellants
submit
that
state
law
regulates
the
activities
of
the
democratic
state
committee.
it
does
not
so
create
them
as
to
strip
them
of
any
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens
and
it
has.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
and
the
convention
has.
the
convention
in
its
charter
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
that
is,
mr.
justice
stevens
that
is
what
the
suit
is
about.
the
convention
said
that
state
committee
shall
be
two
persons
per
county.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
no,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
to
give
you
an
example
of
something
that
occurred
during
the
pendency
of
this
case.
and
i
refer
to
a
matter
outside
the
record,
something
contained
in
the
minutes
of
the
democratic
state
committee
meeting,
and
i
believe
the
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
this
under
the
case
of
texas
railway
v.
pottorff
291
u.s.,
simply
for
the
fact
that
the
state
committee
took
such
an
action.
the
democratic
state
party
platform
for
a
number
of
years
has
espoused,
repealed
state
sales
taxes
on
food
and
drugs.
at
a
meeting
prior
to
a
general
election
to
vote
on
an
initiative
which
would've
accomplished
this
repeal,
the
state
committee
adopted
a
resolution
opposing
it.
now
what
remedy
does
the
state
convention
have
to
bring
the
state
committee
into
line?
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
if
the
state
convention
meets
every
two
years,
it
has
no
power
during
the
interim,
except
through
the
party's
representatives
on
the
state
committee
to
see
that
its
mandates
are
carried
out.
litigation,
if
the
party
cannot
control
the
composition
of
its
state
committee,
so
if
the
state
committee
is
responsive
to
the
party
it
has
no
means
except
litigation,
which
courts
properly
are
reluctant
to
bring.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
washington
gives
the
democratic
party
the
authority
to
assign
functions
to
its
sate
committee,
the
same
state
committee
regulated
by
the
statute
and
to
delegate
authority
to
it.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
must
respectfully
disagree
in
terms
of
terminology,
given
the
decisions
of
the
washington
supreme
court
in
the
king
county
republican
case
and
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
it
seems
odd
that
the
democratic
state
convention
can
ask
its
state
committee
to
do
anything,
as
the
court
below
ruled,
except
to
establish
the
composition
of
the
party
state
committee.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
it
seems
to
me
if
the
convention,
since
it's
a
large
body,
was
going
to
appoint
these
people,
it
would
have
to
elect
them.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
that
would
be
proper.
i
do
know
in
california
for
example,
virtually
every
member
of
a
part
state
committee
is
appointed
by
the
party
officers.
for
example,
the
governor
appoints
two
members,
the
secretary
of
state
appoints
two
members.
this
seems
to
be
a
common
practice
in
a
number
of
states.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
white,
i
thought
about
that
question
and
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
the
state
would
have
a
compelling
state
interest
enforcing
a
state
committee
to
be
a
portion
on
the
basis
of
one
person
one
vote.
in
this
case,
the
two-person
per
county
requirement
of
this
statute
has
already
been
superseded
by
a
federal
court
injunction
requiring
the
state
committee
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
one
person
one
vote
whenever
it
exercises
those
electoral
functions.
the
federal
court
ruling
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
required
it
to
do
so
when
it
performed
these
electoral
activities.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
that
was
a
stipulated
injunction
between
the
democratic
state
committee
and
the
parties
in
that
case,
that
the
state
committee
only
exercises
its
electoral
functions
on
very
rare
occasions.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
there
is
no
way
for
the
party
to
settle
this
in
the
court
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
it
can't
control
its
own
state
committee.
what
the
convention
decides
can
only
be
settled
by
litigation
because
it
has
a
state
committee
whose
composition
it
can
not
control.
that
is
the
substantial
burden
on
freedom
of
association.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
appellants
belief
that
if
parties
are
free
to
decide
how
their
governing
bodies
are
composed,
and
exert
power
over
them
through
the
political
process
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
fact
that
a
legislature
can
remove
a
burden
on
freedom
of
association
and
provide
that
remedy
does
not
excuse
the
substantial
burden
that
is
creating
or
justify
them
in
prosecution
as
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
state
legislature
is
controlled
by
political
parties.
it
is
a
fact
of
political
life
that
often
legislatures
and
politicians
in
office
are
not
exactly
excited
about
having
strong
or
responsive
party
organizations,
and
prefer
to
see
one
that's
built
around
individuals.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
mr.
justice
white,
only
if
the
party
decided
that
if
wish
the
governing
body
of
some
different
composition.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
two
persons
per
county.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
the
party's
preference
should
control.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
because
it
is
a
voluntary
political
association
that
has
a
right
to
decide
for
it
self
how
a
governing
body
shall
be
composed.
the
composition
of
the
party's
governing
body
can
be
as
important
to
the
success
to
that
party
as
the
choices
it
makes
in
its
platform.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
if
the
party
wishes
to
take
a
position
on
a
particular
issue,
it
certainly
can
do
that.
if
it
wishes
to
conduct
a
voter
educator
program
on
a
particular
issue,
i
do
not
--
really
the
state
could
prevent
it
from
doing
that
absence
some
compelling
state
of
which
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
this
is
not
a
realistic
alternative
for
members
of
the
democratic
party
because
they're
permitted
to
its
ideas.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
we
are
not,
mr.
justice
white,
taking
advantages
of
provisions
for
getting
candidates
on
the
ballot.
the
functions
performed
by
this
committee
exclusive
of
those
activities
are
themselves
calling
and
planning
state
conventions,
electing
delegates
to
national
conventions
are
all
protected
by
freedom
of
association
under
this
court's
prior
decisions.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
no,
mr.
justice
stevens.
as
i
indicated
in
the
question
to
mr.
justice
white,
the
state
may
have
a
compelling
state
interest
in
requiring
political
party
state
committees
to
be
a
portion
on
the
basis
of
one
person
one
vote.
otherwise,
i
can
conceive
of
no
other
compelling
--
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
so
that
the
constituency
is
a
state
committee
members
are
composed
of
approximate
equal
members
of
party
members
or
the
electorate.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
said
it
might.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
this
case
cannot
be
distinguished
from
cousins
versus
wigoda.
there,
this
court
held
that
a
party's
choice
and
the
composition
of
its
higher
governing
body
was
a
choice
protected
by
freedom
of
association.
the
matter
there
was
regulated
by
state
law,
yet
the
court
hold
--
held
that
the
state
of
illinois
could
not
interfere
with
the
delegates
chosen
by
the
party
to
attend
the
democratic
national
convention,
or
more
importantly
a
state
caucus
held
to
elect
members
to
the
democratic
national
committee.
and
this
court
said
that
that
membership
in
that
state
caucus
was
protected
by
freedom
of
association
because
the
representatives
elected
to
the
democratic
national
committee
would
be
involved
in
planning
the
next
democratic
national
convention.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
the
effect
of
this
statute.
it
has
prevented
four
of
appellants
from
presenting
themselves
to
the
state
committee
in
participating
in
its
deliberations.
mr.
charles
a.
goldmark
it
is
of
the
same
significance
for
freedom
of
association.
the
fact
that
a
national
party
convention
was
involved
in
cousins,
means
that
states
may
have
different
interests
in
regulating.
a
state
may
not
have
an
interest
in
regulating
a
national
party
convention
or
its
membership,
whereas
it
may
in
regulating
participation
in
state
party
matters,
but
both
are
protected.
the
difference
in
the
compelling
interest
does
not
relate
that
to
strip
away
the
first
amendment
protection
of
the
association
of
party
members.
and
cousins
did
hold
that
stating
or
state
interference
in
a
state
party
caucus
to
choose
representatives
to
the
democratic
national
committee
was
protected.
