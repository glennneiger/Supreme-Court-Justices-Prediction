how
are
these
parties
structured

passed?
chief

warren
e.
burger
does
that
the
matter
of
which
we
could
take
judicial
notice
if
we
knew
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
me,
was
it
a
purely
voluntary
organization
like
that
parent-teachers
association
or
a
garden
club
as
justice

suggested?
just
a
voluntary
--

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think,
mr.
brink,
is
the
federal
issue
involved
in
this
case?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
you
make
your
case
--
do
you
make
your
case,
i'll
put
it
that
way,
if
you
demonstrate
to
us
that
there
is
no
federal
issue
involved
in
the
case?
that
it's
a
matter
for
the
state
legislature
and
people
of
washington?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now,
why
not
focus
sharply
on
that?
chief

warren
e.

you
