justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goldmark,
as
i
understand
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington
you
also
challenged
the
requirement
that
the
composition
of
the
committees
be
one
man
and
one
woman.
you
don't
renew
that
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
between
conventions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
aren't
almost
all
of
them
provide
for
elections
of
county
delegates
or
representatives
and
then
provided
that
the
county
delegates
shall
elect
the
state
committee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
that
the
democratic
state
party?
that
was
what
you
just
said.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
a
relatively
voluntary
organization,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
an
example
supposing
that
the
democratic
state
central
committee
were
on
the
outs
with
the
democratic
state
party
as
represented
by
the
state
convention?
what
sort
of
serious
burdens
could
the
democratic
state
committee
put
on
the
democratic
state
convention
or
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
how
would
a
democratic
state
committee,
composed
such
as
this
one
is
by
a
statute
play
a
role
in
implanting
the
platform
of
the
state
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nothing
that
the
state
central
committee
to
do
would
prevent
the
members
of
the
democratic
state
party,
or
the
people
who
adhere
to
the
platform
without
the
convention
from
espousing
their
views
as
to
how
good
a
platform
it
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
can't
the
party
itself
raise
money
quite
apart
from
the
activities
of
the
state
central
committee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
would
tell
you
if
the
democratic
party
had
a
fund
raising
event
in
seattle
or
spokane
and
tacoma
that
wasn't
sanctioned
by
the
state
central
committee
that
you
couldn't
have
that
event?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
democratic
state
convention,
mr.
goldmark,
had
said
that
the
democratic
state
central
committee
shall
not
be
subject
to
any
elections
at
all,
but
simply
be
appointed
by
the
democratic
state
convention
every
two
years.
and
this
washington
state
legislature
passed
the
statute
saying
“no,
you're
going
to
have
some
elections.”
would
you
feel
you
had
stronger
case?
in
other
words,
the
democratic
state
party
was
asserting
its
authority
over
the
central
committee
by
saying
that
instead
of
having
its
--
the
central
committee
having
its
members
elected,
they
were
going
to
be
appointed
by
the
state
convention.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
that
--
supposing
it
said
then
that
the
chairman
of
the
convention
would
appoint
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
illinois
court
there
enjoin
those
representatives
from
presenting
themselves
as
delegates
to
the
national
convention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
must
have
to
say
that
the
state
central
committee
created
by
a
statue
in
washington
is
of
the
same
political
and
associational
significance
as
the
democratic
or
republican
national
convention
sitting
every
four
years
to
choose
a
presidential
candidate?
