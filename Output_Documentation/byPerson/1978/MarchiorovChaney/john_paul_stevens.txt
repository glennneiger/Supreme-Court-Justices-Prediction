paul

doesn't
everything
you
read
say
it's
all
subject
to
what
the
convention
dictates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can't
the
convention
widely
it
wants
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
that's
--
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
take
the
platform
example
you
gave
in
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
we're
talking.
say
the
central
committee
says
it
shall
be
a,
and
the
convention
says
it
shall
be
b.i
t'll
be
b
won't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh
no,
forgetting
the
membership.
you're
talking
about
if
we're
getting
who
--
on
any
issue
except
who
shall
comprise
the
membership
of
state
central
committee,
wouldn't
the
convention's
views
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
example
would
they
not
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
have
to.
it
just
says
the
policy
of
the
party
shall
be
to
favor
it
instead
of
opposing
it.
and
that
controls
under
the
statute.

mr.

justice
john
paul

mr.
goldmark
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goldmark,
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
if
you
just
reverse
the
positions
in
this
case
and
said
you
wanted
the
just
two
recommend
per
county
or
two
representatives
per
county,
and
the
others
on
the
state
statute
required
the
legislative
representation.
you'd
say
that
was
the
statute
would
be
equally
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
your
position
then
that
no
matter
what
the
requirement
of
the
statute
is,
it
would
be
subject
to
this
attack
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
party
member
per
--
i
mean,
one
voting
party
member
or
one
voter
--
i
mean
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
a
compelling
state
interest
for
having
every
county
represented
would
not
be
a
compelling
state
interest?
