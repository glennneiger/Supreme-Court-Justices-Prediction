justice
potter
stewart
and
they
are
defined
and
provided
for
by
legislation
enacted
by
the
legislature
of
your
state,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
long
has
that
been
true?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
creatures
of
statute,
aren't
they,
the
state
committee?
i
tell
you
i'm
asking
these
questions,
this
is
for
me
a
puzzling
case
and
i'm
sure
you're
going
to
be
helpful
in
straightening
me
out.
but
if
a
state
committee
is
a
creature
of
statute
and
if
it's
--
performed
some
sort
of
statutory
function
in
the
state
of
washington
it's
one
thing.
if
it's
a
private
organization
it's
another.
in
other
words,
i
suppose
the
federal
trade
commission
to
take
the
national
government,
which
is
a
creature
of
statute
couldn't
all
of
a
sudden
have
a
meeting
and
say
“we're
going
to
expand
our
membership
to
15.”
and
then
have
an
argument
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
saying
that
their
rights
of
association
had
been
impaired
because
the
statute
provided
for
a
lesser
number.
on
the
other
hand,
i
suppose
that
it's
equally
clear
that
a
garden
club
could
have
a
legitimate
constitutional
claim
if
the
legislatures,
federal
or
state
said
purported
to
begin
to
direct
what
its
membership
should
be.
and
this
--
these
committees
are
creatures
of
statute,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
not
voluntary
self
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
selecting
organizations.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
creates
it
almost
doesn't
it,
it
--
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
what
a
state
committee
is
and
what
it
shall
be
composed
and
then
it
gets
its
certain
statutory
duties
in
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
that
respect
is
not
unlike
any
governmental
agency.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
many
other
states
are
the
--
are
political
parties
created
and
defined
by
state
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
or
defined
by
state
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
almost
--
that's
the
question
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
now
this
statute
which
is
quoted
in
your
brief
refers
to
the
state
committee
of
each
major
political
party.
i
suppose
elsewhere
in
the
legislation,
major
political
party
is
defined
one
way
or
the
other
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
general
too
in
your
state?
justice
potter
stewart
that
by
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
almost
a
definition
first
of
all,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
states
to
me
“of
each
major
political
party
shall
consist
of”.
and
there's
nothing
in
there
that
says
that
some
other
democratic
political
voluntary
organization
isn't
entirely
free
to
form
itself
and
have
whatever
rules
it
wants
to.
but
the
legislature
has
defined
what
a
state
committee
of
each
major
political
party
is.
justice
potter
stewart
well
isn't
it
that
the
legislature
has
defined
what
the
state
committee
is
and
what
it
shall
consist
of.
now,
it's
not
at
all
unusual
for
a
legislature,
state
or
federal,
to
set
up
advisory
committees.
there's
a
committee
a
generation
--
almost
a
generation
ago
set
up
by
the
federal
government.
i
don't
know
if
it
was
by
legislation
or
resolution
or
what
antitrust
study
group
of
which
my
brother
stevens
was
a
member.
and
i'm
sure
whatever
it
was
whether
it
was
legislation
or
a
resolution
or
an
executive
order
whatever
it
was,
set
up
put
the
membership
of
that
should
be.
and
now
could
that
organization
passed
a
meeting
and
said
“we
want
to
double
our
membership
and
have
a
member
from
every
state.”
once
the
government,
legislative
or
executive
had
set
it
up
and
defined
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
indication
that
this
one
did
either.
what
we
have
before
us
is
a
legislative
act
defining
what
a
state
committee
is.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
state
convention,
i
interrupt
just
for
a
moment,
to
say
is
that
defined
by
statute
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it's
certainly
--
the
situation
is
now
that
what
a
state
committee
is,
is
defined
by
statute.
now
your
remedy
is
to
go
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
and
they
have
to
have
them
either
to
repeal
that
statute
or
amend
it.
but
the
whole
definition
of
what
is
a
state
committee
is
contained
in
the
statute
of
your
state.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
not
just
regulate
it,
it's
created.
it's
defined
by
the
statute,
and
so
far
as
one
can
see,
created
by
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
when
you
say
“they”
is
that
the
state
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
what
party
was
that
in
1948?
justice
potter
stewart
progressive.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
