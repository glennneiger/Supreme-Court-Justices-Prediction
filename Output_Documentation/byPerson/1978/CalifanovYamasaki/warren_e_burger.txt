chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
1511,
califano
against
elliot.
mr.
buscemi,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
take
to
mean
by
that,
“without
fault?”
suppose
there's
a
$5-increase
by
the
state
and
the
recipient
cashes
the
check.
how
does
the
“without
fault”
clause
apply
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
what--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
people
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
merely
an
instruction--
an
internal
instruction,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
$10-a
month.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
$10-limit
merely
binds
the
staff
of
the
social
security.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
check
normally
was
$152
and
the
recipient
gets
a
check
for
$1,152
because
the
computer
has
stripped
its
gears
or
something,
that
would
be
a
clear
case,
wouldn't
it,
that
he
was
at
fault
in
accepting
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
are
at
least
two
different
kinds
of
errors
that
can
be
made,
are
there
not,
at
least
two?
that
is,
one
where
there's
a
change
in
status
and
entitlement
and,
the
other,
where
it's
simply
a
mechanical
error,
is
that
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
absolutely
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
beneficiary
must
also
--
the
secretary
must
also
determine
that
recovery
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
insurance
program
or
would
be
against
equity
in
good
conscience.
and,
he
has
defined
those
phrases
to
include
such
factors
as
financial
hardship
or
detrimental
reliance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
or
do
we
have
to
rely,
if
we
need
it
on
social
security,
on
hew
reports
as
to
how
much
a
year
in
each
fiscal
year
is
overpaid
for
one
reason
or
another
and
how
much
is
--
that
is,
how
much
is
the
area
of
recoupment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
brief
does
not
ar
--
deal
or
at
least
it
does
--
it
dealt
very
briefly
with
section
204,
the
statutory
issue
inherent
in
this
case,
and
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
treated
it.
why
--
do
you
care
to
suggest
hypothesis
as
to
why
neither
of
those
courts
undertook
to
treat
the
statutory
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
doesn't
give
the
court
a
license
--
any
court
a
license
to
ignore
the
statutory
issue
though,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
levin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
give
me
an
example.
put
a
little
flesh
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
excuse
could
be
offered
for
taking
$200
more
than
the
entitlement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that,
do
you
mean
if
there's--
if
the
check
is
--
if
the
payment
is
$200
more
than
the
recipient
is
entitled
to,
do
you
suggest
there
is
any
excuse
for
keeping,
and
any
justification
for
keeping
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
suggest
that
either
of
not
courts
below
have
made
a
determination
or
exhibited
any
great
interest
in
204
(b)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
accept
the
figure
and
for
the
moment,
for
hypothetical
purposes
at
least,
let's
accept
it
that
there's
$600
million
a
year
being
paid
out
that
should
not
be
paid
out.
do
you
mean
to
suggest
that
congress
had
any
notion
that
there
should
not
be
recoupment
for
the
vast
part
of
that,
the
overwhelming
mat
--
portion
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
then,
tangentially
at
least,
that
congress
contemplated
that
they
would
waive
$600
million
if
that
is
the
figure
or
any
such
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
on
any
grounds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
the
tune
of
$600
million,
you
press
it
that
far?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
this
is
purely
hypothetical.
we
don't
know
whether
that's
the
fact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
notice
it
judicially,
depending
on
what
the
records
of
the
department
show.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
under
--
that
there
are
any
circumstances,
and
if
so
suggest
what
the
circumstances
would
be,
in
which
a
$200
recipient
received
$2,200
and
recoupment
should
not
be
automatic,
virtually
automatic?
no
matter
whose
--
let's
assume,
obviously,
that
this
is
the
error
of
the
secretary.
are
you
telling
us
that
that's
what
the
statute
means,
that
the
recipient
could
keep
the
$2,200
even
though,
for
three
or
four
years
before,
the
check
had
been
$200
a
month?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
then
let
me
try
to
apply
that.
suppose
the
showing
before
the
response
was
that,
on
receipt
of
the
$2,200
instead
of
$200,
he
went
out
and
lost
the
$2,000
gambling.
so
that,
when
they
come
for
the
recoupment,
he
hasn't
got
it.
then,
are
you
telling
us
that,
under
this
statute,
it
would
be
inequitable
and
defeat
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
make
him
pay
back
the
$2,200
over
a
period
of
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
--
just
the
facts
i've
suggested
in
the
hypothetical.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
gambled
away
the
$2,000.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
squandered
them
away
and
has
no
other
assets,
you
say
then,
under
this
statute,
it
would
be
inequitable.
the
equity
aspect
of
the
statute,
the
second
leg,
would
come
into
play
and
he
should
not
have
to
return
that
money.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
ten
million
or
more
who
received
checks
every
year,
several
millions
perhaps,
culminate
some
of
the
check
act.
does
this
record
show
how
many
people
send
the
check
back
and
say
there
“mr.
secretary,
you
made
a
mistake.
i'm
not
entitled
to
all
this
money”?
anything
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
--
