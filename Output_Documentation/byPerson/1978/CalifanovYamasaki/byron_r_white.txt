and
then,
i
suppose
there
is--
whichever
way
the
secret
--
if
the
secretary
decides
on
recoupment,
there's
review,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
reviewing
court
decided
that
the
evidence
was
absolutely
equally
balanced,
who
wins?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
why
i
asked
you
--
that's
why
i
asked
you
a
while
ago
what
--
who's
got
the
burden.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
then
undertakes
to
prove
fault.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
--
in
deciding
whether
to
insist
on
recoupment,
the
secretary
then
assumes
that
at
whatever
procedures
he
uses
must
prove
fault.
he
undertakes
to
prove
fault.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
if
the
person
from
whom
recoupment
might
be
sought,
if
he's
completely
silent,
the
secretary
must
still
come
forward
with
proof
of
fault.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
can
comply
with
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
without
extending
the
full
laj
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
if
there
is
fault,
he's
absolutely
barred
from
--
he
must
recoup
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
fault.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
fault
is
only
one
of
the
criteria.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
has
to
be
without
fault
and
the
recoupment
must
be
--
well,
it
must
defeat
the
purpose
of
this
subchapter
or
would
be
against
equity
in
good
conscience
even
if
he's
faultless.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
to
satisfy
that
criteria.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
--
if
you
say
that
everybody
but
the
named
plaintiffs
have
been
getting
recoupment
hearings
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
two-and-a
half
years,
what's
left
of
the
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
constantly
revolving
class.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
agreed
with
you
and
said,
on
behalf
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
the
named
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment
that
whatever
that's
attacked
here
was
unconstitutional.
do
you
need
anything
else
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
the
--
sort
of
a
general,
it
may
or
may
not
be
involved
in
this
case.
if
the
very
provision
you're
attacking
here
is
declared
to
be
unconstitutional,
what
more
do
you
need?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
affirmed
on
the
statute,
would
that
change
your
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
suppose,
you
could
say
you're
entitled
to
urge
the
statutory
ground
now,
here.
