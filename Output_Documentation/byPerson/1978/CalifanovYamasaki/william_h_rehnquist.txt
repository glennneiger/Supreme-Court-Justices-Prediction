whether
those
forms
comply
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
buscemi,
i
realize
it's
difficult
when
you're
peppered
with
questions
from
nine
people
to
know
exactly
what
your
oral
argument
will
cover.
do
you
plan
to
cover
in
your
oral
argument
the
preclusive
effect
of
205
(g)
and
the
availability
of
mandamus
or
do
you
intend
to
leave
that
to
the
briefs?1
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
use
your
own
judgment.
it's
your
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
not
prevent
us
from
reaching,
in
the
government's
view,
the
constitutional
questions
raised
by
a
couple
of
the
named
parties,
but
it
would
prevent
na
--
kind
of
a
nationwide
class
action
designated
in
the
western
district
of
washington.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
you
could
help
me.
at
a
--
at
the
system
that
is
now
in
operation
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
as
you
suggest,
how
does
the
secretary
proceed?
is
the
threat
--
once
there's
--
assume
there's
no
request
for
reconsideration,
only
waiver.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
first
issue
fault?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
must
--
in
order
to
deny
recoupment,
must
the
secretary
conclude
that
the
person
is
without
fault?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
if
the
person
asking
for
a
waiver
presents
no
evidence
whatsoever,
he
just
said
“i
was
without
fault,”
must
the
secretary
undertake
to
prove
that
he
was
at
fault,
or
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
would
depend
to
a
certain
amount
on
the
--
to
a
certain
established
amount
of
the
overpayment.
if
your
ordinary
check
is
$200
and
you
get
a
check
one
month
for
$2,200,
i
suppose
that
finding
a
fault
could
be
inferred.
where
it
--
if
it's
a
$10
or
$20
difference,
it
couldn't
be.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you're
used
to
getting
a
check
for,
say,
$200
a
month
and
you
--
suppose
you
get
a
check
for
$2,200
a
m
--
the
following
month,
would
that
support
a
finding
of
fault
under
the
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
wouldn't
have
petitioned
for
certiorari,
i
presume.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
presume
because
they
just
answered
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
--
suppose
the
named
plaintiffs
here
--
suppose
we
agree
with
you
to
the
extent
of
the
interests
of
the
named
plaintiffs.
what
relief
will
they
achieve?
what
would
be
their
--
what
good
will
it
do
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
there
will
be
a
hearing
before
there's
a
recoupment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
said
there'd
been
recoupment
hearings
going
on
for
two-and-a
half
years.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
suppose
we
agree
with
you,
what
else
is
involved
in
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
respect
to
the
named
plaintiffs,
what
else
do
you
need
besides
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
class
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
remedy
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
would
be
justified
without
finding
that
a
class
had
been
properly
certified?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
say
the
injunction
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
enjoining
it
could
be
issued
in
behalf
of
just
two
named
plaintiffs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
is
by
no
means
peculiar
to
the
secretary
of
hew.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
struggles
year
after
year
to
develop
a
conflict
in
the
circuits,
even
though
circuit
after
circuit
will
go
against
him.
and,
the
same
is
true
of
the
other
administrative
agencies.
i
don't
think
any
agency
is
held
bound
and
take
the
opinion
of
one
court
of
appeals
out
of
11
as
the
final
arbiter
of
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
out
of
11.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
isn't
--
why
isn't
the
commissioner
of
the
internal
revenue's
program
of
seeking
conflicts
treat
the
taxpayers
involved
the
same
way?
