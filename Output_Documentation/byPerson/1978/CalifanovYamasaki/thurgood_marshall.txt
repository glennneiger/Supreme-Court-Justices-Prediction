could
it
be
that
the
computers
are
becoming
more
accurate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
that
could
be
one
reason
for
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
what
good
is
it
to
us,
those
figures?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
governmental
provision
that
allowed
people
to
keep
money
that
didn't
belong
to
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
give
me
one
statute
that
says
that
where
you
get
money
that
you're
not
entitled
to,
you
shall
keep.
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
waiver
but,
i
mean,
it's
not
automatic.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
it's
not.
it's
not
for
me,
but
the
statutes
you're
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
tried
one
time
to
get
a
client
some
money
and
failed.
you
have
to
best
really
learn
what
the
statute
means.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
language,
is
that
in
any
of
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
name
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
railroad
retirement
statute
says
if
you're
overpaid,
you
keep
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
without
fault?
well,
what
does
that
mean?
you
didn't
have
a
gun?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
would
be
one
element
to
be
considered
at
a
personal
confrontation.
of
course,
you'd
have
to
assess
the
credibility
of
that
witness
when
the
witness
said,
as
in
any
credibility
situation,
that
he
or
she
did
not
know
that
what
he
or
she
was
doing
was
incorrect.
what
the
secretary's
regulations
require,
your
honor,
in
response
to
your
question,
they
require
a
very
detailed
assessment
not
only
of
that
fact
that
you
just
articulated,
but
also
the
recipient's
age,
intelligence,
physical
and
mental
condition,
and
a
range
of
other
factors
to
determine
whether
the
recipient
knew,
should
have
known,
or
could
have
known
that
the
retention
or
acceptance
of
the
overpayment
was
wrong.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
not
prosecuted?
