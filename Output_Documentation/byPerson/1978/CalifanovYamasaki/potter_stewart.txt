what
question,
specifically,
is
not
presented?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
is
a
matter
for
the
court
of--
justice
potter
stewart
--
appeals
are
now
being
controverted
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice

eldridge
involved
primarily
a
medical

didn't
it?

expert
medical
opinion.
justice

that's
quite
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
the
beneficiaries.
it's
quite
a
difference
whether
they
lose
their
entire
benefits
or
just
a
reduction,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
issue
is
the
regulations
that
are
no
longer
in
effect,
why
should
we
really
decide
that,
if
the
government
no
longer
has
an
interest
in
defending
those
regulations
if
it's
got
an
amended
regulation
in
effect
now?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
waiver
issue
or
on
the
overpayment
issue
or
on
both.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
dealt
with
both.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
according
to
at
least
one
amicus
brief
here,
the
--
it's
the
understanding
of
that
amicus
that
the
respondents
aren't
even
--
aren't
defending
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
the
overpayment
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
can
tell
us
the
answer.
but
--
but,
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
required
a
prior
hearing
for
both
at
least
when
the
credibility
of
witnesses
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
involved
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
response
of
the
secretary
was
to
say
that
that's
an
unrealistic
dichotomy
and,
therefore,
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
time
being,
providing
hearings
for
everybody.
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
just
before
you
do,
you
can
find
the
procedures
to
the
right
to
waiver
under
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
just
to
the
fact
of
overpayment.
have
you,
as
the
amicus
american
federal
of
labor
and
congress
of
industrial
organizations
understands
it,
do
you
no
longer
defend
the
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
that
relates
to
hearings
as
to
the
fact
of
overpayment?
justice
potter
stewart
we
like
to
understanding?
justice
potter
stewart
ever
--
ever?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
so,
this
involves
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
area
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
recoupment
should
be
waived
under
the
statute
404
(b).
justice
potter
stewart
particularly
--
going
exclusively
to
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
only?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
overpayment
is
not
the
fault
of
the
beneficiary,
then
it's
not,
whether
or
not
he
knew
it
was
an
overpayment.
justice
potter
stewart
enough,
enough.
the
overpayment
is
a
result
of
misrepresentations
on
the
part
of
the
beneficiary,
that's
clearly
his
fault.
justice
potter
stewart
if
an
overpayment
is
a
computer
error
or
a
miscalculation
on
the
part
of
the
agency,
it's
not
his
fault
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
remains
the
same
issue
even
though
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
it
changes,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
get
a
copy
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
referred
to
in
oral
arguments
this
morning.
until
that
reference
was
made,
i
didn't
know
there
was
one.
it
was
filed
only
last
friday.
justice
potter
stewart
it
goes
to
the
statutory
--
justice
potter
stewart
also
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
the
claim
that
the
statute
itself
requires
a
prior
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
instead,
said
the
constitution
requires
one.
