mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
the
procedures
employed
by
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
in
recovering
overpayments
to
the
beneficiaries
of
social
security,
old
age,
survivors,
and
disability
insurance.
the
principal
question
presented
is
whether
a
beneficiary
is
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
before,
rather
than
after,
his
monthly
benefits
are
reduced
to
recover
a
previous
overpayment.
the
case
is
here
for
the
second
time
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1976,
in
response
to
the
secretary's
petition
for
review,
this
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
decision
in
mathews
against
eldridge.
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
its
initial
result
and
the
secretary,
again,
sought
certiorari.
there
were
two
suits
consolidated
in
the
court
of
appeals:
one,
from
the
western
district
of
washington,
buffington
case
and,
the
other,
from
the
district
of
hawaii,
elliot.
buffington
is
a
nationwide
class
action
on
behalf
of
recipients
of
old
age
and
survivors
benefits.
elliot
is
limited
to
persons
living
in
hawaii
but
it
includes
disability
beneficiaries
as
well
as
old
age
beneficiaries.
the
procedures
attacked
by
respondents
begin
with
the
secretary's
determination
that
an
overpayment
has
occurred.
in
many
cases,
this
determination
is
based
on
an
annual
earnings
report
filed
by
the
beneficiary
himself.
other
times,
the
initial
determination
is
based
on
the
secretary's
independent
discovery
of
some
administrative
error
or
a
fact
or
event
that
affects
a
recipient's
continuing
eligibility
for
benefits.
when
the
secretary
concludes
that
an
overpayment
has
occurred,
he
notifies
the
beneficiary
of
his
determination.
respondents'
complaints
in
the
district
courts
challenge
the
adequacy
of
the
notice
provided,
and
the
district
courts
ordered
that
the
secretary
provide
a
more
detailed
information
about
the
reasons
for
the
overpayment
and
the
availability
of
administrative
review.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
the
secretary
did
not
seek
further
review
of
this
aspect
of
the
court's
decision.
instead,
he
has
developed
more
elaborate
notice
forms
that
the
social
security
administration
is
now
using
in
notifying
beneficiaries
that
they've
received
overpayments.
there's
apparently
still
some
squabbling
in
the
court
of
appeals
over
whether
the
new
forms
comply
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
but
that
question
is
not
presented
here.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
new
notice
forms
that
the
secretary
has
developed
in
response
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
mr.
peter
buscemi
exactly.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
right.
the
secretary's
notice
informs
the
beneficiary
of
the
date
and
the
amount
of
the
overpayment
and
the
way
in
which
it
occurred.
the
local
social
security
officers
are
instructed
to
make
sure
that
the
explanation
is
kept
in
simple
and
non-technical
terms.
the
notice
also
informs
the
beneficiary
of
the
secretary's
proposed
method
of
recovery.
the
date
of
the
first
monthly
payment
to
be
reduced
at
the
amount
of
the
reduction,
and
the
month
in
which
full
benefits
will
be
resumed
after
the
overpayment
has
been
recovered.
in
addition,
the
beneficiary
is
told
that
his
right
to
request
reconsideration
of
the
overpayment
determination
or
waiver
of
recovery
or
both.
and,
standards
for
waiver
are
set
forth
in
the
notice
and
the
procedures
for
requesting
reconsideration
or
waiver
are
described.
they
are--
the
notice
identifies
the
forms
that
must
be
completed
in
connection
with
an
application
for
reconsideration
or
waiver,
and
volunteers
the
assistance
of
employees
at
local
social
security
offices
in
filling
out
the
forms.
finally,
the
beneficiary
is
advised
that
if
he
does
request
reconsideration
or
waiver
within
30
days,
his
benefits
will
not
be
reduced
until
after
the
secretary
has
acted
on
his
request.
even
if
no
request
is
made
within
30
days
of
the
notice,
a
reconsideration
request
made
within
two
months
or
a
waiver
request
whenever
made
halts
the
reduction
of
benefits
and
results
in
the
resumption
of
full
benefits
until
after
the
secretary
has
acted
on
the
request.
the
statutory
provision
that
gives
rise
to
all
these
procedures
is
section
204
of
the
social
security
act.
section
204
(a)
provides
that
whenever
the
secretary
find
that
more
than
the
correct
amount
of
payment
has
been
made,
proper
adjustment
or
recovery
shall
be
made
under
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary,
but
section
203
(b)
adds
a
qualification.
it
says
that
there
shall
be
no
recovery--
mr.
peter
buscemi
they
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition
at
pages
155
(a)
and
156
(a).
the
qualification
section
204
(b)
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
recovery
in
any
case
where
the
overpaid
person
is
without
fault
in
receiving
the
overpayment
and
where
the
recovery
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
insurance
program
or
would
be
against
equity
and
good
conscience.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
the
“without
fault”
language
is
described
in
the--
or
is
defined,
i
should
say,
in
the
secretary's
regulations
in
20
cfr
404.507,
i
believe.
mr.
peter
buscemi
and
there
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
and
there,
the
secretary
states
that
the
critical
consideration
is
whether
the
beneficiary
should
have
known
that
he
was
receiving
or
had
received
an
overpayment.
now,
in
the
case
of
a
difference
as
small
as
the
one
that
you
suggest,
it
may
well
be
that
the
average
beneficiary
should
not
have
known
that
he
was
receiving
an
overpayment.
and,
in
any
event,
a
difference
of
that
size
is
not
likely
to
be
recovered
by
the
secretary
because
his
own
claims
manual
provisions
require
that
there'd
be
at
least
a
$10-a
month
reduction
benefits,
otherwise,
recovery
is
simply
waived.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well--
mr.
peter
buscemi
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
that's
included
in
the
claims
manual.
it's
not
included
in
the
regulations,
but
the
regulations
do
include
the
definition
or
the
secretary's
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
“without
fault”
in
the
statute.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
the
waiver
procedure
is
that
the
beneficiary
who
believes
that
he
is
without
fault
and
that
recovery
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
program
files
a
prepared
form
with
the
secretary,
it's
form
no.
ssa-632,
and
that
is
divided
by
into
several
parts,
the
first
part
of
which,
addresses
the
question
of
“without
fault”
and
it
asked
--
i
think,
the
question
says
to
the
beneficiary,
“state
why
you
believe
that
you
were
not
overpaid
or
why
you
believe
that
you
were
not
at
fault
in
receiving
the
overpayment.”
mr.
peter
buscemi
oh,
definitely.
if
the
secretary
receives
the
form
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
--
i
mean,
i
don't
know
because
i
don't
know
what
the
cases
have
held
but
i
think
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think,
in
a
closed
case
like
that,
the
secretary
would
waive
recovery.
mr.
peter
buscemi
before
the
administrative
review,
i
suppose
that
the
secretary
would
have
to
show
that
the
beneficiary
should
have
known
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
he
then
takes
to
determine
whether
the
beneficiary
should
have
known
that
he
was
receiving
an
overpayment,
and
that's
the
standard
that
he
uses
in
acting
on
the
waiver
application
and
if
the
sa
--
and
i
assume
that
the
same
standard
would
apply
in
the
later
administrative
review
proceedings.
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
that's
not
so.
i
think
that
the
secretary's
regulations
are
perfectly
reasonable
implementation
of
the
statutory
scheme.
if
the
person
does
not
request
waiver
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
if
the
person
does
not
suggest
that
he
was
not
at
fault,
i
think
the
secretary
is
justified
in
proceeding
with
recovery.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
precisely
the
case
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
cases
that
are
exactly
like
that.
i
think,
for
example,
the
case
of
mrs.
biner,
one
of
the
respondents
in
the
buffington
suit,
is
similar
to
that.
it
does
not
involve
a
computer
error,
but
involves
a
report
to
the
local
social
security
office
that
employment
--
that
earnings
will
be
discontinued
and
social
security
benefits
would
have
begun.
earnings
continued
at
the
same
level,
but
--
and
the
social
security
benefit
payments
were
accepted
by
mrs.
biner.
she
had
told
the
social
security
office
that
she
would
be
earning
--
she
would
not
be
earning
any
money
and,
therefore,
the
benefits
should
begin.
when
she
did
earn
the
same
amount
of
money
that
she'd
been
earning
for
the
previous
two
years,
she
should
have
known
that
the
benefits
could
not
be
paid
at
that
level.
and,
that's
in
fact
what
has
been
found
not
only
by
the
secretary
on
his
initial
review
of
the
waiver
application,
but
also
by
the
administrative
law
judge
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
was
provided
for.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
there
are
many
possibilities.
mr.
peter
buscemi
so
that
even
if
there
is
no
financial
hardship
if
the
regulations
provide,
20
cfr
404.509,
that
if
the
beneficiary
has
relied
to
his
detriment
on
an
overpayment
which
he
was
without
fault
in
receiving,
then
there's
no
recovery
even
if
it
could
be
recovered
without
any
--
imposing
any
financial
hardship.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
record
does
show
the
number
of
overpayments
made
in
a
year.
it's
a
rather
extraordinary
number,
approximately
one-and-a
quarter
million
overpayments
a
year.
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
shows
the
average
amount
of
those
overpayments,
although
we
have
obtained
the
social
security
administration's
latest
figures
on
that
and
they
suggest
that
the
average
amount
of
an
overpayment
is
in
the
vicinity
of
$500,
so
that
we
are
talking
about
something
like
$600
million
a
year.
it's
the
total
amount
that's
overpaid.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
a
little
bit
unclear,
but
i
think
that
means
that
many
persons.
now,
respondents
contend
that
section
204
(b)
of
the
social
security
act
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
require
that
they'd
be
afforded
an
opportunity
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
their
benefits
are
reduced
to
recover
an
overpayment.
they
devoted
little
attention
to
the
statutory
argument
in
the
courts
below
and
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
district
courts
addressed
it.
rather,
the
courts
held
that,
under
this
court's
decision
in
goldberg
against
kelly,
the
due
process
clause
requires
a
pre-recoupment
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
heavily
on
an
earlier
decision
by
the
third
circuit,
mattern
against
weinberg,
that
it
reached
the
same
result.
the
secretary
has
petitioned
for
review
the
third
circuit's
ruling,
no.
78-699
from
that
appendix.
five
months
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
this
court
decided
eldridge.
eldridge
held
that
due
process
does
not
require
a
hearing
before
the
secretary
may
terminate
social
security
disability
benefits
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
disability
has
seized.
when
the
court
remanded
the
present
case
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
eldridge,
the
court
of
appeals
distinguished
eldridge
and
adhered
to
its
earlier
conclusion.
the
court
ruled
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
in
the
court's
opinion
in
eldridge,
the
court
emphasized
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
disability
continued
could
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
written
submissions
because
the
bulk
of
the
evidence
would
be
medical,
but
the
court
did
note
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right,
but
the
court
did
note
in
eldridge
that
credibility
of
the
claimant
might
well
be
relevant
in
the
ultimate
disability
assessment.
for
example,
where
the
question
of
disability
turns
on
the
extent
of
pain
or
discomfort
in
performing
certain
operations,
the
claimant's
disability
might
well
be
involved,
and
the
court
did
recognize
that
in
the
eldridge
opinion.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
did
plan
to
say
something
about
that.
i
can
summarize
it
now
if
you'd
like.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
just
to
be
very
brief
about
it,
the
argument
that
the
secretary
has
made
in
his
brief
is
that
this
court
in
the
salfi
case
held
that
205
(h)
--
section
205
(h)
of
the
social
security
act
precludes
other
basis
of
district
court
jurisdiction
and
limits
district
court
jurisdiction
to
that
provided
in
section
205
(g)
of
the
act.
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
and
this
court's
interpretation
in
salfi,
we've
argued
that
there
is
no
possibility
for
mandamus
jurisdiction
under
section
1361.
that's
the
argument.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
our
view
of
the
matter.
there
is
--
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
of
the
individual
named
respondents
because
of
this
court's
interpretation
of
section
205
(g)
in
the
eldridge
case.
there
has
not
been
a
final
decision
of
the
secretary
at
the
end
of
the
full
administrative
review
procedure,
but
this
court
held
in
eldridge
that
such
a
final
decision
was
not
necessary
where
there
is
a
constitutional
right
asserted
and
the
claim
was
collateral
to
the
entitlement
to
benefits.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
i
think
the
answer
is
quite
clear.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
respondents
made
very
little
of
the
statutory
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
do
think
that
the
court's
view
of
the
case
is
inevitably
colored
by
the
briefs
that
are
filed
by
the
parties,
and
i
think
that
where
the
claim
of
the
respondents
was
almost
exclusively
addressed
to
the
constitutional
point,
it's
not
surprising
that
the
court
viewed
the
case
in
that
light.
in
any
event,
as
we
suggest
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
nothing
to
the
statutory
argument
in
the
secretary's
view.
the
respondent
contends
that
unless
the
secretary
undertakes
a
very
exacting
inquiry
in
his
words
concerning
fault
in
the
equitable
considerations
involved,
in
each
case,
he
violates
the
statute.
the
idea
is
that
the
secretary
cannot
recover
any
overpayment
unless
he
determines
that
the
criteria
of
section
204
(b)
are
not
met.
but,
the
point
of
the
secretary's
procedures
is
that
he
determines
that
the
criteria
of
204
(b)
are
not
met
by
asking
the
individual
beneficiary
whether
he
wishes
to
request
reconsideration
or
waiver.
if
the
beneficiary
does
not
wish
to
request
either
of
those
forms
of
administrative
relief
but,
instead,
is
willing
to
allow
the
overpayment
to
be
recovered,
then
the
secretary
goes
ahead.
and,
this
is
an--
it
seems
to
me,
a
reasonable
procedure
to
affect
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
now,
eldridge
applied
three
considerations
that
guide
the
court
in
determining
what
process
is
due
in
a
particular
situation.
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
this
but,
we
think,
reached
the
wrong
result.
the
first
of
the
considerations
is
the
private
interest
that
would
be
affected
by
the
deprivation.
the
respondents'
attempt
to
analogize
the
interest
in
keeping
overpayments
to
the
interest
in
the
continued
payment
of
welfare
benefits
that
was
at
issue
in
goldberg
against
kelly,
but
there
are
important
distinctions
between
the
two.
goldberg
is
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
an
interruption
in
government
payments.
the
situation
that
prompted
this
application
of
the
due
process
clause
was
very
different
from
that
involved
here.
the
disputed
benefits
there
were
granted
on
the
basis
of
need
and,
by
definition,
they
were
the
only
means
by
which
the
recipients
could
pay
for
food
and
clothing,
shelter
and
medical
care.
here,
the
social
security
insurance
benefits
are
not
based
on
need.
they--
the
average
social
security
beneficiary
well
have
independent
assets.
he
may
well
be
able
to
earn
money
by
working
and
he
may
well
be
eligible
for
welfare
payments
if
a
reduction
in
social
security
payments
renders
him
unable
to
meet
his
current
expenses.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
not
necessarily,
mr.
justice
stevens.
as
we
mentioned
in
response
to
your
previous
question,
the
social
--
the
particular
recipient
may
say
“i
have
relied
on
the
overpayment.
i
was
without
fault
in
receiving
it.
therefore,
i'm
entitled
to
keep
it,
whether
or
not
i
need
it.”
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
a
--
the
regulations
apparently
say
that
he
would.
the
regulations
say
that
if
there
has
been
detrimental
reliance.
now,
the
secretary
might
try
to
avoid
allowing
him
to
keep
it
by
saying
that
it
has
not
been
detrimental,
but
i
think
that
he
probably
would,
under
the
regulations
properly
construed.
in
addition,
the
deprivation
here
is
not
as
serious
as
the
one
in
goldberg
because
it
only
involves
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
benefits,
not
a
complete
termination.
the
only
time
in
which
benefits
will
be
completely
terminated
under
the
secretary's
overpayment
recovery
program
is
when
the
beneficiary
was
at
fault.
i
mean,
when
the
overpayment
was
received
as
the
result
of
fraud
or
when
the
beneficiary
has
sufficient
income
that
his
entire
social
security
check
can
be
withheld
and
he
will
still
be
able
to
meet
current
expenses.
in
no
other
situation
under
the
secretary's
program
will
all
the
benefits
be
withheld.
finally,
the
third
factor
that
the
eldridge
court
addressed
was
the
government's
interest
in
the
efficient
functioning
of
its
program
and
the
administrative
burden
that
additional
procedures
would
entail.
it's
difficult
to
make
precise
predictions
about
the
amount
of
cost
that
would
be
involved
in
the
kind
of
evidentiary
hearing
requested
by
respondents,
but
the
court
in
eldridge
said
that
the
additional
cost
were
likely
to
be
substantial
and
any
time
the
additional
procedures
were
required,
and
i
think
that
that
is
equally
valid
here.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
several
of
the
ways
in
which
the
requirements
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
could
--
will
affect
the
social
security
program.
and,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
into
further
detail
here.
if
the
final
thing
that
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
the
secretary's
procedures
have
been
shown
to
be
reliable
on
the
basis
of
the
experience
not
only
before
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
but
after.
the--
out
of
the
one-and-a
quarter
million
overpayments
each
year,
there
are
only
approximately
40,000
people
who
asked
for
reconsideration
or
waiver.
and,
of
those,
approximately
half
are
granted
waiver
on
the
basis
of
the
written
submissions.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
we
hope
so.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
the
figures
are
relevant
because
they
do
indicate
that
the
evidentiary
hearing
sought
by
respondents
is
not
required
in
order
to
make
sure
that
payments
are
made
to
those
people
who
deserve
them
and
that
overpayments
are
only
recovered
from
those
people
who
can--
who
are
supposed
to
pay
them
back.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
40,000-figure
is
a
figure
that
comes
from
years
more
recent
than
those
covered
by
those
figures
before
the
district
court.
the
--
if
you
look
in
the
petition--
the
appendix
of
the
petition
at
pages
99
(a)
and
100
(a),
you'll
see
the
figures
that
were
presented
to
the
district
court
and
they
are
very
incomplete.
they
have
an
accurate
figure
on
the
number
of
overpayments,
but
they
have
a
very
--
they
have
a
much
too
small
figure
on
the
number
of
request
for
reconsideration
or
waiver.
they
list
only
about
12,000
requests.
it's
not
clear
whether
that
12,000-figure
includes
only
requests
for
reconsideration
or
also
request
for
waiver.
the
secretary
now
reports
that
the
number
of
times
he
gets
a
request
for
reconsideration
that's
not
accompanied
by
request
for
waiver
is
very
small.
most
beneficiaries
are--
do
not
contest
the
fact
that
they
have
received
an
overpayment
or,
if
they
do,
they
also
ask
for
waiver.
and,
that
number
is
about
40,000
now.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
the
question
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
regulations
before
they
were
amended,
but
the
only
thing
that's
been
amended
is
the
claims
manual
which
deals
with
the
partial
adjustment
system.
and,
that's
what
we
described
in
our
brief.
that
has
allowed
the
secretary
to
defer
recovery
and
extend
it
over
a
longer
period
of
time,
and
it
also
means
that
the
secretary
no
longer
proposes
a
complete
termination
of
benefits.
he
only
proposes
a
25%
reduction
of
monthly
benefits.
now,
that
particular
provision
of
the
claims
manual
was
not
before
the
courts
below.
but,
with
respect
to
the
remainder
of
these
provis
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
true,
but
in
practical
effect,
under
the
partial
adjustment
system
that
was
in
effect
before
the
courts
below,
the
secretary
as
a
general
rule
did
grant
partial
adjustments
that
were
requested.
the
difference
was
more
in
the
form
of
the
initial
notice
to
the
beneficiary.
it
said
“we
will
stop
your
monthly
benefits
unless
you
request
waiver
or
reconsideration
or
unless
you
request
some
other
adjustment.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
issue
is
whether
the
respondents
are
entitled
to
an
oral
hearing
before
recoupment
begins.
that
issue
remains
under
the
new
regulations.
there
is
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
also
a
little
bit
unclear.
i
think
respondents
are
defending
the
decision
on
the
overpayment
issue
if
a
particular
request
for
reconsideration
raises
an
issue
of
credibility.
they
are
not
--
they
are
not
saying
that,
in
the
average
case,
a
request
for
reconsideration
requires
a
prior
hearing.
i
may
be
wrong
about
that,
but
that's
the
way
i
read
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
exactly.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
it's
just
been
providing
hearings
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
in
all
cases,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
in
the
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
what's
been
happening
is
that
there
have
been
personal
conferences
set
up
before
the
recoupment
begins,
and
then
the
full
laj
hearing
has
been
kept
at
the
time
after
the
beginning
of
a
hearing.
so,
what--
so,
in
practical
effect,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
has
resulted
in
the
insertion
of
a
new
layer
of
review
before
the
beginning
of
recoupment.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
full
laj
hearing
apparently
does
entail
more
expense
and
more
delay
than
the
personal
conference
procedure
that's
now
being
used.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
it
entails
more
expense
in
the
sense
that
the
--
it
will
probably
mean
that
there
will
be
a
longer
period
of
time
before
recoupment
begins
because
it's
more
difficult.
the
informal
personal
conference
procedure
that
the
secretary
has
developed
to
comply
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
can
be
administered
much
more
simply
than
the
full
laj
hearing
that
he
has
been
providing
afterwards.
mr.
peter
buscemi
until
there
is
a
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
written
submissions.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
once
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
written
--
of
the
written
submissions
is
made,
then
recoupment
begins
and
then,
if
there
is
a
reversal
after
the
laj
hearing,
then
there
is
full
restitution
of
any
moneys
that
have
already
been
withheld.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
the
court
of
appeals
listed
a
number
of
things
that
have
to
be
provided
at
the
personal
conference
and
they
are
provided.
they
are
titled
--
the
beneficiary
is
entitled
to
present
evidence
through
witnesses
and
documents
he's
entitled
to
cross-examine
adverse
witnesses
and
he's
entitled
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
thank
you.
