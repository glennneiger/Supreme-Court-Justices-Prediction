harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
just
wondering.
why
is
it
a
matter
of
discretion?
would
it
cost
the
government
anything
significant
to
just
move
up
the
hearing
to
a
pre-reduction
hearing
instead
of
a
post-reduction
hearing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
it
entail
more
expense
if
it
comes
later
instead
of
earlier?
i
mean,
when
it
comes
earlier
instead
of
later?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
didn't
you
tell
us
--
i'm
just
--
maybe
i've
got
this
confused.
didn't
you
tell
us
that
if
there
is
a
request
for
a
waiver,
that
you
then
do
not
--
then
that
automatically
suspends
things
until
there's
a
final
decision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
see
--
i
see.
i
thought
it
does
not
suspend
it
until
after
the
laj's
decision.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
doesn't
say
without
knowledge.
it
says
without
fault.
and,
that
would
seem
to
imply
some
causative
element
and
if
the
overpayment
of
$2,000
was
not
directly
or
indirectly
caused
by
the
beneficiary,
how
could
he
be
with
--
have
any
fault
about
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
levin,
could
you
help
me
with--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
in
my
own
mind
what
the
constitutional
issue
is
in
this
case.
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
oral
hearing
must
precede
the
reduction
in
the
recoupment.
and,
in
the
oral
hearing,
i
had
thought
there
was
just
the
hearing
before
the
laj,
but
it's
been
made
clear
today
that
there
are
two
different
oral
hearings
that
we're
talking
about:
an
informal
hearing
and
then
there's
a
later
hearing
before
the
laj.
under
your
view,
is
the
constitution
satisfied
with
the
informal
hearing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
do
you
understand
that
the
government
is
asking
to
have
that
oral
hearing
dispensed
with?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
don't
want
even
the
informal
hearing.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
see.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
they
want
a
right
to
change
the
regulations
back
to
the
way
they
use
to
be.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
other
than
that,
there's
really
no
issue
before
us,
isn't
that
right?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
they
said
they
were
satisfied
to
continue
to
provide
the
oral
hearing,
there
will
be
no
dispute.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
incidentally,
is
respondent
elliot
out
of
the
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
--
are
you
going
to
substitute
somebody
for
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
you
think,
mr.
levin,
that
the
changes
are
--
change
the
issues
in
this
case?
