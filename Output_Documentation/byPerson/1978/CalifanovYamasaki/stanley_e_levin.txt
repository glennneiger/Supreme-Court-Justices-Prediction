mr.
stanley
e.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
i
think
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
say
what
this
court
--
this
case
is
really
about.
before
you
today
are
elderly,
infirmed
and
minor
recipients
of
social
security
benefits
who've
been
operating
under
a
system
which
the
secretary
has
had
an
operation
for
two-and-a
half
years
which
has
successfully
and
satisfactory
provided
them
with
a
very
flexible
administrative
procedure
which
did
not
yet
exist
prior
to
this
court
of
appeals
judgment,
which
allows
them
to
--
and
meets
their
capabilities
as
elderly,
infirmed,
and
minor
recipients
to
assert
and
--
their
right
to
waiver
under
the
statute.
i'd
like
to
go
through,
for
a
minute,
what
the
system
has
been
for
two-and-a
half
years
to
show
how
flexible
it
has
been
and
show
the
various
choices.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
we
do
not
defend
the
need
for
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
a
personal
confrontation
basis
merely
for
the
--
to
contest
the
existence
of
hearing.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
in
this
case
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
it
involves
only
the
issues
which
are
the
highly
subjective
credibility
issues
under
the
secretary's
own
regulations,
under
his
claims
manual,
and
all
--
and
the
other
instructions
of
waiver.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
only
to
waiver.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
the
system
for
two-and-a
half
years,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question,
has
been
one
which
allows
three
choices:
(a)
one
of
written
submissions,
which
exis
--
which
was
the
only
choice
under
the
earlier
system,
and
for
the
very
small
number
of
recipients
who
are
before
you
today
for
whom
that
is
a
meaningful
and
effective
means
of
asserting
the
waiver
question,
that's
still
retained.
the
other
two
choices
are
informal
and
personal
conferences,
and
these
allow
the
recipient
the
vital
and
crucial
element
of
a
personal
confrontation,
of
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
not
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
the
restrictions
are
--
the
requirements
are
far
less
rigid
than
in
goldberg,
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognize
this
and
allowed
for
this
imbalance
for
this.
so,
the
system
has
been
in
operation
for
two-and-half
years
satisfactorily.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
properly
acquired
this
kind
of
system
and
we
believe
it
is
consistent
with
both
the
statutory
204
(b)
rights
and
with
the
constitution.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
yes,
sir.
contrary
to
counsel's
statement,
the
burden
the
secretary
has
placed
is
totally
on
the
recipient
to
come
forward
and
show
that
he
is
not
at
fault
and
that
either
the
recovery
would
be
against
equity
in
good
conscience
or
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
title
2.
so,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
regard
--
and
for
the
other
questions
regarding
the
million-dollar
situation,
if
you
are
not
in
need,
if
you
are
not
poor,
you're
not
entitled
to
waiver.
under
this
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that
is
what
congress
has
said,
your
honor,
under
204
(b).
the
basic
fundamental
dispute
in
this
case
seems
to
be
a
continual
ignoring
by
the
secretary
of
the
exact
wording
of
204
(b),
and
the
mandatory
language
where
congress
has
said
“we're
going
to
vest
the
right
to
a
pre-recoupment
waiver
decision
when
these
very
individualized
and
subjective
issues
of
waiver
in
the
recipients
and
then
only
then
if
the
secretary
needs
to
burden
under
204
(b)
can
he
then
take
the
money
back
from
them.”
and,
this
shifting
of
the
burden
which
is
so
crucial
to
recipients
who
are
incapable
of
letting
themselves
to
written
submissions
but
it
isn't?
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
that's
why
the
case
involves
highly
subjective
detailed
factual
inquiries
into
what
fault
is
in
a
given
situation.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
a
very
good
example,
your
honor,
would
be
one
of
the
named
respondents,
mrs.
yamasaki.
in
mrs.
yamasaki's
situation,
she
received
a
notice
saying
that
she
had
been
overpaid
due
to
the
secretary's
processing
error
and
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$200.
she
cashed
the
check,
not
knowing
what
the
check
was
for,
and
she
put
in
her
request
for
waiver
that
she
had
no
idea
that
if
she
was
wrong
to
keep
the
money
or
accept
the
money.
obviously
for
her,
the
only
way
to
effectively
present
her
case
as
to
whether
or
not
she
was
wrong
to
accept
or
retain
that
money
is
for
her
to
meet
person-to-person
with
the
decision
maker
and
for
him
or
her
to
assess
mrs.
yamasaki's
credibility
and
motivation.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
there
are
many
situations,
your
honor,
where
the
social
security
system
issues
checks,
supplemental
checks,
or
true
active
checks,
adjustment
checks
in
many
situations
where
they
can
be
appropriate
to
keep
the
money.
in
any
event,
congress
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is
congress
has
made
that
choice.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
congress
has
said
they
are
going
to
--
they
are
vested
with
this
money
until
the
secretary
comes
forward
and
then
shows
these
grounds
under
204
(b)
to
take
it
away.
congress
has
made
that
choice
because
congress
has
reviewed
the
social
security
system
and
knows
how
difficult
and
how
chaotic
it
is.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
they
have
to
the
extent
that
204
(b)
is
a
crucial
element
in
weighing
a
private
interest
in
this
case.
and,
204
(b)
is
a
crucial
element
in
certain
parts
of
the
constitutional
analysis.
we
did
present
the
argument
at
every
stage
of
the
appellant
process
that
the
secretary's
recoupment
procedures,
as
existed
then,
were
absolutely
barred
by
204
(b).
the
court
did
not
rule
on
it.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
congress
said,
your
honor,
in
1939
when
it
enacted
this
statute
and
1967
when
it
affirmed
it
again,
that
persons
who
are
without
fault
and
against
whom
recovery
calls
a
hardship
will
be
able
to
keep
the
money.
now,
that
$600
--
$600million
figure
is
consistent
with
the
other
statistics
which
the
secretary
has
just
revealed
--
unveiled
lately
and
which
were
never
proved
at
the
district
court
level
or
the
circuit
court
level
in
terms
of
an
evidentiary
hearing.
if
that
is
a
correct
figure,
i
think
it's
basically
irrelevant
at
a
disposition
in
this
case
today.
you
must
look
to
the
congressional
intent
and
the
congressional
purpose
and
language
at
204
(b).
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
congress
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
congress
was
clearly
saying,
because
they
used
the
words
“shall
be
no
recovery,”
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
what
congress
said,
your
honor.
obviously,
it
would
not
be
to
the
tune
of
$600
million.
it
never
has
been,
and
its
guesstimates
and
speculation
like
that
in
the
part
of
the
secretary.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
the
point.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
we
don't
know
what
the
exact
figure
is,
your
honor.
it
could
be
only
$100,000.
the
point
is,
congress
said,
“we
are
going
to
set
up
a
unique
statutory
scheme
where
there's
a
limited
group
of
social
security
recipients
will
be
protected
and
they
will
be
--
that
group
will
be
people
who
are
without
fault
and
against
whom
recovery
will
cause
a
hardship
or
who
detrimentally
relied
on
this
recovery
or
retention
of
the
overpayment.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
absolutely,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
waiver
provisions
in
a
number
of
civil
rights
retirement
statutes.
there
are
approximately,
i
think,
12
of
them.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
the
civil
rights
retire
--
civil
right
--
civil
service
retirement
statute,
the
railway
retirements
statute,
and
other
similar
retirement
type
statutes,
also
with
the
right
for
waiver
provisions
identical
to
the
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
no,
sir.
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
no,
it's
the
same
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
they
are
not
automatic,
your
honors.
if
you
establish
the
conditions
of
a
waiver,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
the
waiver
language,
to
the
extent
that
it
protects
a
limited
group
of
people
under--
as
it
did
under
204,
is
applicable
or
app
--
exists
in
other
retirements
statutes,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
the
civil
service
retirement
statute
and
the
railroad
retirement
statute
are
two
examples
i
can
think
of.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
if
you
are
without
fault
and
you
are
in
need.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
no,
your
honor,
what
that
means
is
that
you
did
not
know
or
could
not
--
did
not
know
that
the
retention
of
the
or
acceptance
of
the
overpayment
was
incorrect
or
erroneous.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
some
of
those
factual
situations
do
arise,
your
honor.
the
secretary
does
make
certain
move
--
take
certain
steps
to
move
recipients
from
various
programs:
from
the
disability
program
to
the
retirement
program,
from
the
survivor's
program
to
the
retirement
program.
and,
when
he
does
that,
he
sends
out
checks
in
recipient's
--
correctly
sends
out
checks.
so
those,
you
often
could
not
presume
the
mere
sending
of
a
check
which
is
large
is
automatically
an
error.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that
has
generally
been
our
position,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
that
the
certain
statute
has
made
that
determination
because
of
using
the
language
“fault,”
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
one
factor
to
be
considered,
we
think
it
should
be
given
very
little,
if
no
weight.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
is
important
to
note,
in
response
to
your
question,
is
that
congress
knew
that
there
were
going
to
be
many
people
overpaid
and
knew
that
there'd
be
many
people
--
that,
i
mean,
most
of
the
errors
we
do
the
secretary's
own
errors
and
not
the
recipient's
generated
errors.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
and
most
of
the
recipients
before
you
today
have
exactly
that
situation.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
if
to
assessing
the
credibility
of
that
individual,
it
is
clear
that
individual
was
not
at
fault
in
generating
or
accepting
that
overpayment.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
its'
the
first
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
was
just
going
to
get
to
that.
not
only
must
he
satisfy
that,
but
it
also
must
--
if
he
has
the
money
to
be
recovered,
then
the
fault
criteria
will
fall
to
the
wayside.
you
must
be
either
be
at--
must
be
both
be
at
fault
--
not
at
fault
and
you
must
be
poor.
under
those
two
situations,
you
will
get
waiver.
if
you
don't
meet
either
those
criteria,
you
do
not
get
waiver.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
your
honor,
are
you
presuming
in
your
hypothetical
that
he
is
at
fault
and
you're
directing
it
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
in
that
situation
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
i
think
gambling
is
actually
irrelevant,
your
honor.
the
question
becomes
one,
again,
if
he
was
at
fault
or
not
at
fault.
and,
if
he
has
the
money,
he
may
have
other
resources
to
recover
from,
the
secretary's
regulation
require
an
in-depth
financial
evaluation
of
all
pertinent
circumstances
and
assets
or
resources
of
that
particular
recipient.
if
that
were
the
case,
in
fact,
whether
he
gambled
it
away
or
lost
it
or
it
was
stolen
or
he
was
robbed
is
absolutely
irrelevant.
the
question
is
whether
he
has
these
assets
to
satisfy
the
recoupment.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
as
long
as
if
he
has
--
if
he
does
not
have
any
other
resources
or
assets,
the
fact
that
he
has
or
doesn't
have
the
money,
no
matter
how
that
occurred
is
irrelevant,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
absolutely.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
absolutely.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
they
don't
want
--
they
do
not
want
to
continue
what
has
been
continuing
for
the
last
two-and-a
half
years
in
working
satisfactorily.
they
want
to
perhaps
have
the
authority
to
go
back
to
the
old,
very
limited,
very
telescoped
written
submission
procedure,
which
is
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
needs
and
capabilities
of
the
these
recipients.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
perhaps,
your
honor,
we
don't
know.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
the
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
i
don't
know
why
they
petitioned
for
certiorari,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
i
assume
so.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
the
named
plaintiffs,
your
honor,
in
the
elliot
proceeding
have
had
their
recoupments
or
action
taken
regarding
their
recoupment
or
their
hearings
halted
pending
the
disposition
of
this
litigation.
so,
they
still
have
a
justiciable
controversy.
so,
if
this
court
were
to
rule
that
they
had
the
right
as
to
the
two
lower
courts
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
twice
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor,
there
must
be.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
as
to
other
members
of
the
class
asking
for
--
ironically,
not
as
to
most
of
the
named
plaintiffs.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
from
our
point
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
the
extent
of
our
relief,
your
honor.
it's
all
the--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
secretary
has
raised
the
jurist
--
the
class
problem
as
a
jurisdictional
problem.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
properly
found
that
it
could
grant
for
relief
under
mandamus
statute
or
under
205
(g).
we
believe
that's
an
appropriate
disposition
of
the
case.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
your
honor,
this
court
could.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
i
think
it
could,
your
honor,
normally.
it's
not
a
matter
of
ruling
the
statute
unconstitutional.
it's
if
the
secretary's
procedure
is
pursuant
to
the
statute.
the
problem
is,
your
honor,
that
the
reason
the
class
action
and
the
injunction
and
relief
are
needed
is
been
the
secretary's
conduct
in
a
series
of
other
litigations
that
he
has
not
in
fact
followed
rulings
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
for
example,
in
the
decision
of
califano
versus
white
where
there
had
been
a
spate
of
lawsuits
filed
in
the
same
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
califano
versus
white
made
in
its
determination.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
your
honor,
first
of
all,
there
are
two
courts
of
appeals
who
ruled
consistently
here,
the
third
circuit
in
mattern
versus
califano,
and
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
and
there's
only
two
courts
in
which
the
issue
has
been
presented.
secondly,
the
secretary
has
only
raised
this
issue
about
conflicts
in
the
circuits
as
a
means
of
claiming
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
get
review
by
this
court.
we
are
very
confident
that
this
court
can
control
its
docket,
and
it's
calendar,
and
it's
--
the
matters
which
come
before
it.
and,
we'll
see
that
if
a
matter
is
that
impressing
and
important
in
the
courts
rules
and
to
rule
19,
that
this
court
will
indeed
review
that
issue
and
take
appropriate
action.
i
think
setting
a
decision
or
authorizing
or
--
that
there'd
be
no
nationwide
class
actions
in
a
situation
like
the
case
before
you,
we're
saying
that
the
secretary
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
class
actions
under
1361
or
under
205
(g)
are
inappropriate
is
an
absolutely
unworkable
and
unjust
result
to
occur
for
this
group
of
recipients.
it
essentially
makes
social
security
recipients,
your
honor,
second-class
citizens.
essentially
says
that
they
cannot
get
full
relief
in
federal
court
on
constitutional
challenges
to
illegal
procedures
of
the
secretary.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
you
mean,
we
will
take
appropriate
action
to
that
your
honor,
yes.
there
are
several
more
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
no,
sir.
there
are
several
more
points
which
i'd
like
to
make
in
my
remaining
time.
as
i
was
indicating
earlier,
the
secretary
has
made
certain
changes
in
his
regula
--
in
his
procedures,
his
claims
manual
procedures
which
are
not
non-binding
and
are
not
part
of
the
administrative
regulations,
and
those
procedures
he
claims
are
material
to
the
disposition
of
the
constitutional
issue
in
balancing
of
the
private
interest
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
those
changes
are
absolutely
regressive
and
do
not
enhance
a
situation
whatsoever
because,
actually,
affirmatively
discouraged
persons
and
recipients
concerning
their
right
to
waiver.
i
can
explain
that
in
a
moment,
but
what
is
important
to
us,
your
honor,
is
that
if
this
court
in
any
way
believes
these
changes
are
material
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
we
believe
the
case
ought
to
be
remanded
back
to
the
courts
--
the
district
courts
which
issued
the
injunctions
in
this
case
for
them
to
prove
the
effect
of
any
of
those
injunctions
of
those
procedural
changes.
we
now
think
of
this
the
way
we
should
be
discussing
de
novo
these
changed
procedures
in
december
of
1978,
after
six-and-a
half
years
litigation,
based
on
a
particular
system
of
recoupment.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
they
certainly
not
provide
the
pre-recoupment
opportunity
to
be
heard,
not
the
evidentiary
hearing
but
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
as
required
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct.
that
issue
is
still
there,
but
what
these
procedural
changes
do,
your
honor,
unfortunately
is
a
discouraged
waiver
assertions
by
clients
because
they
actually
ensure
that
clients
who
seek
waiver
will
not
get
the
maximum
25%
partial
adjustment
protection.
a
recovery
against
them
is
open-ended.
so,
obviously,
if
i
know
that
i
can
get
a
25%
maximum
recovery,
i'll
do
that
and
i'll
forgo
my
statutory
and
perhaps
constitutional
right
to
have
the
case
decided.
and,
that
is
a
direct
and
affirmative
discouragement
to
its
statutory
right
to
waiver.
and
it
is
because
of
that
we're
--
this
certainly
is
a
justiciable
controversy,
but
we
think
the
effect
of
that
shall
be
litigated
if
the
court
thinks
that's
material
in
the
lower
courts
where
it
probably
belongs.
to
that
end,
we
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
remand
in
this
case
in
january,
but
it
was
denied.
we
renew
that
request
now,
if
the
court
deems
these
procedures
material.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
people
who
come
forward
on
an
ongoing
basis,
your
honor.
if
this
court
were
not
to
rule
on
our
f
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
--
yes,
sir,
it
is
because
the
secretary
issues
these
recoupment
notices
daily.
he
issues
1.25
million
of
them
a
year,
most
of
which
are
his
errors.
in
that
vein,
therefore,
there
are
people
who
are
regularly
trying
to
assert
their
right
to
waiver.
i
would
like
to
make
a
point
here
though,
mr.
justice
white.
the
point
is
that
the
notice
aspect
of
this
case
which
counsel
indicated
was
not
before
this
court
is
an
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
because
both
the
lower
courts
and
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
people
were
not
properly
informed
of
the
right
to
waiver.
because
of
that,
many
of
them
did
not
exercise
certain
statutory
and
constitutional
rights
they
would've
certainly
otherwise
done.
the
secretary
has
not
appealed
that
and
that's
res
adjudicada.
and,
that
is
an
essential
difference
between
this
case
and
certain
other
cases
where
you
would
require
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
and
be
concerned
about
the
class
definition
because,
in
this
case,
there
are
fundamentally
constitutionally
defect
of
notice
where
persons
could
not
have
exhausted,
could
not
have
asserted
their
rights
because
they
didn't
know
what
their
rights
were
and
i
think
the
maneuver
by
the
secretary
not
to
appeal
that
decision,
i
do
not
want
that
to
relieve
this
court
of
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
your
honor,
again,
i
go
back
to
my
answer
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
problem
with
that,
to
the
extent
that
you
authorize
or
approve
of
or
acquiesce
in
the
secretary's
position
that
social
security
recipients
are
not
entitled
to
class
actions
in
a
federal
court
for
procedural
constitutional
attacks
or
statutory
attacks
like
califano
versus--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
i
assume
the
secretary
would
abide
by
the
decision
of
this
court
and,
if
he
did
that,
we
would
not
need
anything
further,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
we
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
we
have
no
idea.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
yes,
your
honor,
we
got
it
at
the
last
minute
also.
and,
we
reviewed
it
and
we
think
it's
the
first
occasion
which
the
secretary
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
absolutely,
your
honor.
it
was
six
years
and
we
raised
it
in
the
lower
courts,
in
the
complaints.
we
raised
it
in
the
appellate
court.
we've
briefed
it,
and
the
secretary
has
ignored
it
and
treated
as
though
it
did
not
exist
because
he
has
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
it,
your
honor,
for
the
importance
of
balancing
the
private
interest
in
this
case,
recognizing
that
it
was
a
congressional
mandate
that
there
shall
be
no
recoupments
only
in
these
certain
limited
situations.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well
--
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
--
we
would
be
--
we
would
take
the
position
that
we
believe
an
affirmance
is
absolutely
appropriate
in
this
case,
but
that
if
the
court
believes
it
necessary,
we
could
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
litigate
the
statutory
issue
because
we
believe
it's
an
essential
issue
in
this
case.
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
many
occasions,
it's
the
first
duty
of
any
reviewing
court
to
try
to
dispose
of
any
constitutional
issue
without
reaching
the
constitutional
issue
and
first
disposing
on
the
statutory
grounds,
which
can
be
done
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
levin
well,
that's
what
we're
doing,
your
honor,
and
we
briefed
it
thoroughly.
we
briefed
it
thoroughly,
although
we
have
--
if
the
court
believes
that
it's
essential
for
them
to
have
the
thoughts
and
disposition
of
the
lower
court,
we
are
willing
to
go
back
and
litigate
that
issue
there
at
that
time.
thank
you,
your
honor.
