john
paul
stevens
where
are
you
before
this
is
set
out
with
in
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whose
the
--
what
is
the
practice
as
to
the
burden?
in
order
to
recoup,
must
the
secretary
prove
fault?
i
mean,
fault
seems
to
be
a--
if
the
person
is
without
fault,
there
can
be
no
recovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
who
--
what
is
the
procedure
for
determining,
if
you
or
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
buscemi,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
beneficiary
proves
that
he
or
she
was
without
fault
is
not
enough
to
establish
the
right
to
retain
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
use
the
1.25
million,
does
that
mean
that
many
persons
or
that
many
checks?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
buscemi,
isn't
it
true
that
almost
by
hypothesis,
one
who
request
a
waiver
does
so
on
the
basis
of
need,
claim
of
need
at
least?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
secretary
let
that
person
keep
it
he
had
$1
million
in
the
bank?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
buscemi,
on
those
figures,
are
you
giving
us
figures
under
the
revised
regulations
or
are
those
that
were
in
effect
before
the
litigation
began?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
related
question,
i
suppose,
what
do
you
perceive
the
issue
to
be,
the
constitutionality
of
the
regulations
before
they
were
amended
or
the
constitutionality
of
the
regulations
after
the
amendment
which
would
mean,
i
guess,
that
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
views
of
the
lower
courts
on
the
latter
question?
which
--
which
are
we
suppose
to
decide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
does
the
government
concede
that
there
is
a
constitutional
entitlement
to
a
hearing
at
some
time,
a
post-reduction
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
to
me,
is
it
--
in
the
government's
view,
will
there
be
a
greater
number
of
hearings
if
they
come
before
the
reduction
takes
effect
and
if
it's
postponed?
