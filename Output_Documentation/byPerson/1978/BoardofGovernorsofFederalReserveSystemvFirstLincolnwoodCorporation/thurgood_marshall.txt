do
you
think
they
should
ignore
“monetary
policy?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
they?
justice
thurgood

in
one
grant
you
say
that
that's
their
job.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
your
next
grant
you
say,
but
they
shouldn't
do
it
when
it
comes
up
against
my
bank.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
in
the
legislative
history
did
you
get
any
of
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
should
assume
that
any
administrative
body
is
obliged
to
do
that
whether
it's
judiciary
or
anything
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
wrong
with
what
was
done
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
wanted,
do
you
take
the
rules
says
that
once
the
comptroller
meets
and
decides
in
favor
of
the
bank
that
all
the
federal
reserve
board
does
is
rob
his
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
--
what
is
different
from
that
on
the
other
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
listen,
it's
a
federal
reserve
board,
it's
not
the
federal
reserve
court.
justice
thurgood

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
issue
is
whether
the
bank
holding
company
act
of
1956
allows
the
federal
reserve
board
to
deny
approval
of
certain
transactions
that
would
not
weaken
the
financial
condition
of
a
holding
company
or
a
subsidiary
bank
but
would
produce
a
financially
unsound
bank
holding
company.
the
first
lincolnwood
corporation
was
organized
to
serve
as
a
bank
holding
company.
the
organizers
proposed
to
exchange
the
shares
of
the
company
for
their
shares
of
the
first
national
bank
of
lincolnwood
and
to
have
the
holding
company
assume
a
debt
they
had
previously
incurred.
the
purpose
of
this
reorganization
was
to
enable
the
holding
company
and
the
bank
to
realize
substantial
tax
savings.
the
board
disapproved
the
proposed
transaction
finding
that
the
holding
company
and
the
bank
did
not
meet
its
standards
of
financial
soundness.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
in
an
en
banc
decision.
the
court
held
that
although
the
board
could
approve
its
base,
its
decision
solely
on
financial
factors,
it
must
approve
a
transaction
that
did
not
compound
the
acquired
bank
financial
difficulties.
by
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
board's
actions
were
within
its
statutory
authority.
both
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
support
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
as
an
authorization
to
deny
application
solely
on
grounds
of
financial
soundness
or
unsoundness.
further,
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
requires
a
board
to
approve
transactions
merely
because
they
would
not
weaken
a
subsidiary
bank's
financial
condition.
the
board's
exercise
of
its
authority
to
prevent
the
formation
of
financially
unsound
bank
holding
company
has
had
significant
and
beneficial
effects
on
the
banking
system.
the
effects
of
which
congress
has
been
appraised
and
although
congress
has
amended
the
statute,
it
has
not
sought
to
curtail
the
board's
authority.
we
see
no
basis
for
this
court
to
act
where
congress
has
not.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joins.
