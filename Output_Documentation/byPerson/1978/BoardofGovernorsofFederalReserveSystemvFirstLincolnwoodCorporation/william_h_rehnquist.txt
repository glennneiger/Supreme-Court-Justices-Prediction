justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
the
board
kind
of
has
the
red
light
and
says,
“unless
you
meet
--
unless
the
bank
meets
particular
qualifications
which
we
would
not
independently
enforce
if
you're
holding
company
application,
we
will
deny
leave
for
formation
of
the
holding
company.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
the
dividends
be
extracted
by
the
present
owners
if
there
is
no
holding
company?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what
good
does
it
do
to
deny
the
application?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sanctions
are
available
on
the
part
of
any
federal
agency
for
the
bank's
failure
to
meet
the
standard
you're
referring
to
apart
from
the
application
for
a
holding
company?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
didn't
do
it
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
holding
company
is
kind
of
a
goody
that's
held
out
in
exchange
for
giving
up
this
rather
extended
proceeding
that
would
be
necessary
if
the
bank
didn't
want
a
holding
company?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the
criminal
law
area
this
has
been
outlawed
for
years,
i
suppose
you
realize
that
they're
making
someone
give
up
a
right
to
jury
trial
in
that
sort
of
a
thing
like
the
case
right
behind
you
is
not
too
different
from
that.
granted
this
is
of
--
this
is
the
area
of
civil
or
right
in
criminal
but
don't
you
have
any
hesitation
about
advancing
that
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
acts
specifically
authorize
that
sort
of
test,
don't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
didn't
say
it
say
it
in
this
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
the
board
could
have
a
general
rule
though
by
which
it
treats
a
number
of
applications?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
anytime
you're
adjudicating
a
case
involving
a
particular
applicant
like
your
client
here,
you
make
the
adjudication
on
individual
factual
determinations
but
then
you
apply
policy
to
them,
don't
you
whether
its
legislation
or
rule
making
or
what?
