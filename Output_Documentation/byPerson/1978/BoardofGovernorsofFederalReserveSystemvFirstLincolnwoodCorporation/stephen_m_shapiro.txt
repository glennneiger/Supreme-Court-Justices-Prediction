mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
federal
reserve
board's
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
set
aside
an
order
of
the
board
which
it
denied
respondent
permission
to
become
a
bank
holding
company
under
the
bank
holding
company
act
of
1956.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
board
may
deny
a
bank
holding
company
application
where
the
proposed
bank
subsidiary
is
undercapitalized
and
where
the
proposed
holding
company
would
be
so
encumbered
by
debt
that
the
bank
would
remain
undercapitalized
for
a
period
of
at
least
12
years.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
whether
they
have
the
statutory
authority
to
deny
the
application
and
we're
here
today
to
contend
that
the
board
may
indeed
deny
such
an
application
unless
it
entails
the
capital
deficiency's
remedy.
respondent
is
an
illinois
corporation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
in
respondent's
brief,
the
point
is
made
that
the
capital
ratios
were
low
that
is
recognized
in
seventh
circuit
opinion
and
indeed
it's
recognized
in
all
of
the
other
submissions
from
the
comptroller
and
from
the
federal
reserve
bank
and
from
the
board's
staff.
respondent
is
an
illinois
corporation
which
plan
to
acquire
80%
of
the
voting
stock,
the
first
national
bank
of
lincolnwood.
it
stated
in
its
application
that
it
would
assume
not
only
the
stock
but
also
a
debt
in
the
sum
of
$3.7
million.
respondent
also
planned
to
cause
the
bank
to
issue
an
additional
million
dollars
in
debt
securities
after
formation
of
the
holding
company
and
an
additional
million
dollars
in
equity
after
the
holding
company
was
formed.
the
application
was
initially
reviewed
by
the
chicago
federal
reserve
bank.
the
reserve
bank
recommended
approval
of
the
application
despite
its
recognition
that
the
capital
level
in
the
bank
was
below
the
board's
current
guidelines
and
would
remain
below
those
guidelines
during
the
12-year
period
needed
to
retire
the
debt.
the
reserve
bank
believed
however
that
the
competence
of
management
and
possible
improved
earnings
were
positive
factors
which
outweigh
the
low
capitalization
factor
and
in
the
brief
letter,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
joined
in
that
affirmative
recommendation.
when
the
application
was
received
by
the
board
in
washington,
it
was
reviewed
initially
by
the
board's
division
of
research
and
statistics
and
then
again
by
its
division
of
banking
regulation
and
supervision,
both
of
which
recommended
denial.
they
pointed
out
again
that
the
bank
was
seriously
undercapitalized
at
present.
the
ratio
of
capital
to
assets
was
5%
when
it
should
have
been
at
least
8%.
that
meant
that
the
bank
needed
an
additional
$2.5
million
in
equity
capital
to
meet
the
board's
minimum
standards.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
correct
but
the
insistence
in
this
category
of
cases,
the
capital
be
replenished
as
a
prerequisite
to
getting
the
desired
change
and
status
is
the
motivation
that
makes
applicants
come
up
with
the
additional
equity
capital.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
light
is
red
until
the
board
examines
the
financial
resources
of
the
parent
and
the
subsidiary
and
has
to
find
that
each
is
adequate
under
the
board's
current
standards
and
in
this
case,
it
found
a
serious
deficiency
in
the
bank
and
it
found
that
the
holding
company
by
extracting
dividends
from
the
bank
would
keep
the
bank
would
keep
the
bank
in
that
undercapitalized
state
for
a
period
of
at
least
12
years.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
by
insisting
on
replenishing
of
capital
in
this
kind
of
case
where
there's
a
serious
deficiency,
the
board
has
obtained
an
injection
of
badly
needed
capital
in
some
400
separate
cases
and
an
injection
of
some
$2
billion
in
badly
needed
equity
in
the
banking
system.
that's
the
good
that's
done
and
that's
what
at
stake
with
this
application
approval
power.
the
power
has
been
used
effectively
and
successfully
to
augment
the
capital
base
in
the
nation's
banks.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
there
is
a
test
that
has
to
be
passed.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
precisely
the
point
and
this
procedure
is
identical
to
the
procedure
under
the
federal
reserve
act
which
congress
stated
was
the
model
to
be
applied
here.
when
an
applicant
seeks
membership
in
the
federal
reserve
system,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
change
in
status
would
cause
a
worsening
of
its
condition.
it
hardly
ever
will.
it's
inconceivable
that
it
would.
the
question
though
in
this
context
is
whether
minimal
standards
are
met
and
if
they're
not
met,
the
applicant
is
told
to
go
back,
improve
the
situation
and
come
back
at
a
later
date
for
a
board
approval
and
that's
the
approach
that's
been
applied
consistently
under
the
holding
company.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
they
are.
they
are
indeed
guarantors,
secondarily
liable.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
situation
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
the
situation
remains
in
the
state
of
serious
undercapitalization.
there's
no
improvement
over
a
12-year
period
and
that's
the
crux
of
our
different
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct
and
that's
why
at
this
juncture,
the
board
insists,
there
now
be
an
improvement
to
remedy
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
not
a
price,
it's
the
statutory
criteria.
our
financial
resources
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
until
the
8%
standard
has
been
satisfied,
the
subsidiary's
condition
is
seriously
deficient
and
that
has
to
be
remedy
as
a
prerequisite
for
approval.
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
certainly
is
very
significant
advantage
in
having
the
holding
company
status.
the
holding
company
for
one
thing
is
in
the
position
to
issue
debt
securities
without
the
restrictions
under
regulation
cue
that
apply
to
individual
banks
with
the
holding
company
based
additional
business
activities
can
be
entered
into.
there
are
numerous
benefits
in
addition
to
the
tax
advantage.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
not
in
illinois,
that's
correct.
illinois
has
limits
on
branch
banking.
one
facility
within
15,000
yards,
the
second
facility
within
two
miles
and
that's
it
but
in
many
states,
of
course,
where
there
are
limits
on
branching,
you
can
get
around
those
limits
by
setting
up
a
holding
company
with
multi-bank
subsidiaries.
oklahoma
and
texas
are
clear
examples
of
that
situation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
holding
company.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
holding
company
under
this
application
would
remain
simply
a
shell.
it
would
have
no
additional
working
assets
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
it
assumes
the
indebtedness.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
would
have
no
income
other
than
the
dividends
paid
from
the
bank
which
would
otherwise
be
otherwise
be
paid
to
these
guarantors
that
you
referred
to
so
it
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
in
the
first
year,
the
saving
would
be
roughly
a
$130,000.00
diminishing
every
year
down
to
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
government's
position
is
that
if
this
new
valuable
status
is
sought,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
parties
seeking
this
new
advantage
to
shoulder
the
responsibility
of
maintaining
adequate
capital
in
the
bank,
that's
the
government's
position
in
mitchell.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
its
based
on
the
long
history
that
we
cite
on
the
brief,
one
pertinent
portion
of
that
is
the
analysis
or
the
analogy
to
the
practice
under
the
federal
reserve
act
where
an
applicant
can't
obtain
membership
in
the
system
unless
its
capital
as
adequate
relative
to
assets
and
relative
to
liabilities
in
the
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
a
certainly
economic
differences
but
congress
said
that
they
are
inconsequential
and
that
the
same
pattern
is
applicable
under
the
holding
company
act.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
think
that
that
concession
has
been
estrange
a
bit
but
we
do
agree
that
a
hundred
and
$130,000.00
benefit
is
better
than
no
one
$130,000.00
benefit
and
that's
a
positive
factor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
can
point
to
possible
harm
and
the
board
did
that
in
its
opinion.
it
pointed
out
that
there
could
be
a
weakening
of
the
banks
financial
condition
and
what
it
meant
by
that
was
what
the
staff
had
indicated
in
its
projections
of
the
condition
of
the
bank
for
a
12-year
period.
capital
ratios
could
decline
slightly
to
a
4.8%
starting
at
5.2%
but
that
was
based
on
a
number
of
assumptions
and
it
was
caused
by
a
number
of
factors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
some
of
which
would
not
have
applied.
the
issuance
of
the
million
dollars
in
debt
securities
was
a
new
step
and
that
gives
rise
to
new
debt
service
requirements
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
every
year,
that
was
a
new
element
but
we
do
not
say
that
there's
any
assurance
that
this
bank
subsidiary
would
be
worse
of
12-years
hence,
it's
a
possibility
and
there
are
other
possible
dangers
that
result
from
the
affiliation
of
a
bank
and
a
leverage
holding
company.
the
beverly
hills
national
bank
case
is
a
vivid
example.
in
that
case,
the
holding
company
issued
commercial
paper,
debt
â€“
short-term
debt
securities
and
it
was
unable
to
meet
its
obligations
on
that
commercial
paper.
only
$2
million
in
debt
and
that
caused
the
run
on
the
bank.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
even
though
the
bank
was
sold.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i'd
--
i
have
never
seen
that
fact
referred
to
your
honor
that
there
was
less
than
80%
control
in
the
beverly
hills
national
bank
case.
i
believe
that
there
was
80%
control.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
difficulty
was
that
that
the
holding
company
couldn't
meet
a
relatively
small
obligation
on
its
debt
securities
and
even
though
the
bank
resounds,
this
caused
the
panic
among
depositors.
$30
million
in
deposits
were
withdrawn
in
three
days.
this
is
a
possible
difficulty
that
results
from
the
combination
of
a
highly
leverage
holding
company
with
large
amounts
of
debt
outstanding
and
the
possibility
of
not
being
able
to
meet
its
obligations.
this
is
a
danger
imposed
on
the
bank
that
wouldn't
otherwise
exist.
we're
not
saying
that
will
happen.
the
board
made
no
finding
that
it
necessarily
would
result
but
that's
the
sort
of
danger
that
the
board
takes
into
account
when
it
talks
about
possible
weakening
which
it
referred
to
in
its
opinion.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
reserve
bank
in
chicago
recognized
the
low
capitalization
problem
and
recognized
its
persistence
but
it
felt
that
there
was
a
strong
management
in
this
bank
and
that
the
management
had
done
a
lot
of
good
for
the
bank
which
we
don't
dispute
and
that
this
management
shouldn't
be
faulted
for
taking
over
the
bank
at
the
time
of
difficulty
and
a
sop
if
you
will
should
be
thrown
to
them
and
that
possible
improved
earnings
could
reduce
the
string
on
the
capital
but
the
board
simply
disagreed
concluding
that
the
low
capitalization
factor
was
such
a
serious
problem
that
steps
had
to
be
taken
out.
that
persuasion
and
suggestion
and
urging
of
improvement
wasn't
enough
and
that
the
board
had
to
insist
upon
application
of
its
8%
rule.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
comptroller
originally
recommended
against
the
transaction
on
the
ground
that
the
bank's
capital
was
too
low.
later,
he
changed
his
mind
on
the
theory
that
the
injection
of
million
dollars
of
debt
and
the
million
dollars
in
equity
would
be
some
improvement
in
the
situation
and
indeed
it
would
initially
capital
in
the
bank
would
be
raised
somewhat
but
it
would
still
be
$1.5
million
short
and
that's
the
objection
of
the
board.
even
with
this
injection
of
capital
it's
not
close
to
the
standard
that
it
should
be.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
apart
from
denial
of
the
holding
company,
it
is
in
theory
possible
that
the
comptroller
could
commence
a
cease
and
desist
proceeding
involving
a
trial
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
didn't
do
it
here.
he
has
relied
extensively
on
moral
persuasion
and
urging
for
improvement
and
the
reason
for
that
is
obvious.
this
trial
procedure
is
a
highly
cumbersome
and
time-consuming
proceeding
that
may
end
up
nowhere.
by
that
i
mean
that
if
there's
an
order
to
cease
and
desist
from
being
under
capitalized
and
market
conditions
are
such
that
stock
can't
be
sold,
there
may
be
no
way
to
comply
with
the
order.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
the
board
or
the
comptroller
had
to
conduct
trial
and
an
appeal
in
the
judicial
enforcement
proceeding
every
time
that
they
needed
to
correct
the
capital
deficiency
in
some
400
cases
of
the
board
alone,
they'd
be
doing
nothing
else
but
conducting
these
kinds
of
trial,
it
would
be
totally
infeasible.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
don't
because
no
right
here
is
being
given
up.
there
is
no
right
to
holding
company
status
unless
and
until
its
determined
that
the
resources
of
the
bank
and
the
holding
company
are
adequate
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
and
what
that
means
is
that
this
8%
test
has
to
be
met
and
its
perfectly
common
in
this
industry
for
a
bank
that
seeks
the
changing
status
to
have
to
pass
the
test
in
financial
soundness
and
until
it
does
that,
the
application's
approval
is
withheld.
that's
a
common
procedure
under
the
federal
reserve
act,
under
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company
act
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
this
act,
the
legislative
history
makes
very
clear,
incorporates
these
same
standards.
congress
said
that
the
very
same
considerations
that
are
used
under
the
federal
reserve
act
and
under
the
fdic
act
should
be
applied
under
the
bank
holding
company.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
they
said
it
in
the
house
report
that
a
company
that
--
and
they
used
the
term
financial
resource
and
what
after
all
is
a
resource.
the
literal
definition
of
that
term
means
something
set
aside
in
extra
additional
support,
that's
the
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
resource
and
that's
just
what
capital
is
in
the
banking
system.
it's
a
cushion,
something
extra,
something
set
aside
as
insurance
against
poor
earnings,
against
bad
loans,
against
unexpected
demands
from
depositors
rather
creditors.
so
resource
adequacy
is
what
we're
talking
about
and
we're
talking
about
capital
adequacy.
i
think
the
statute
literally
read
supports
us
directly.
this
history
that
i
referred
to
keying
the
statute
to
the
federal
reserve
act
supports
us
directly
and
the
whole
history
before
that
under
the
1933
act
supports
us
directly
where
congress
expressly
said
that
the
holding
company
should
be
a
source
of
strength
to
an
undercapitalized
subsidiary
and
that
if
capital
was
inadequate
at
the
application
stage,
that's
a
ground
for
denial.
that's
been
the
pattern
since
1933
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
not
only
the
history
but
the
literal
text
is
four
square
behind
us.
we
would
expect
respondent
to
point
to
something
in
the
history
that
suggest
that
the
boards
inference
is
incorrect
about
its
own
statutory
authority
but
respondent
hasn't
done
that
i
think
that
that's
a
testimony
to
the
support
of
nature
of
this
history.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
since
1970,
400
applications
have
been
held
to
be
deficient
under
the
standard
under
holding
company
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--
act
alone
and
that's
just
one
agency
as
scrutinizing
capital
in
banks
and
in
each
of
this
cases
the
boards
insisted
on
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct
and
the
denial
was
combined
with
an
improvement
at
the
later
stage
resulting
in
a
replenishing
of
the
needed
capital
and
board's
testimony
before
the
senate
in
1976
was
that
this
has
resulted
in
the
injection
of
some
$2
billion
in
additional
capital
and
so
we're
talking
about
a
recurrent
problem
that's
dealt
with,
we
think
economically
under
the
statutory
provision.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct
and
the
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
know
that
that
isn't
true
because
the
board
has
made
statistical
analysis
of
banks
within
different
peer
groups
and
within
this
peer
group
which
is
a
size
criterion,
the
average
nationally
is
9%
and
so
the
board's
8%
standard
is
somewhat
lower
than
the
national
average.
it's
a
problem
in
many
cases
but
on
the
average,
the
banks
do
better
than
the
board's
standards
but
that's
not
to
say
that
it
isn't
a
recurrent
problem
that
has
to
be
dealt
with
in
an
economical
way
under
the
board's
supervisory
powers.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
am
informed
that
it
is
as
close
to
a
flat
rule
as
it
could
possibly
be,
i
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
contained
in
the
uniform
system
of
bank
classification
which
is
in
the
bank
examiner's
manual
which
has
been
in
existence
since
1969.
it's
referred
to
from
time
to
time
in
board
opinions,
its
contained
in
the
banking
treatises
that
bankers
rely
on
and
it's
constantly
the
subject
of
discussion
between
bankers
and
bank
examiners
when
there's
a
case
of
under
capitalization.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
a
bank
that
was
below
the
8%
standard
wouldn't
get
into
the
federal
reserve
system
until
it
improved.
the
holding
company
that
sought
to
acquire
would
not
get
holding
company
status
until
it
was
improved
and
fdic
insurance
wouldn't
be
had
until
the
capital
deficiency
was
improved.
it's
a
very
serious
matter,
its
one
of
the
prerequisites
of
banking.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
pardon
me?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
such
a
draconian
sanction
that
it's
never
been
done.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
if
this
bank
were
denied
its
fdic
insurance,
it
would
mean
that
it
would
go
under
receivership.
it's
a
national
bank
and
it
has
to
have
it
and
so
methods
other
than
the
ultimate
weapon
are
used
and
one
weapon
of
course
is
just
urging
from
the
regulatory
authorities
to
improve
but
that's
proven
to
be
inadequate
and
this
case
has
proven
to
be
inadequate.
the
comptroller
urged
this
bank
repeatedly
that
its
capital
funds
picture
should
be
replenished
and
restructured
to
a
fully
acceptable
level
and
that
the
board
of
director
should
take
immediate
steps
to
achieve
that
end.
the
comptroller
understands
in
73
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
not
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
not
to
the
state
because
it's
still
in
litigation
and
of
course
they
hope
for
success
which
would
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
hope
that
it
will
be
achieved
through
the
offer
of
new
equity
securities
by
the
bank,
by
finding
new
ventures
at
the
holding
company
level,
or
by
retaining
the
earnings
for
a
period
of
time
in
the
bank,
any
of
these
steps
could
be
employed
to
replenish
the
capital
base
and
if
that
occurs
and
it
should
occur
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
then
this
respondent
is
free
to
return
to
the
board
to
get
a
fresh
appraisal
of
its
application.
we're
not
being
obstructive.
we're
not
standing
in
the
way.
when
this
improvement
takes
place,
we'll
give
the
application
--
a
first
consideration
and
we
welcome
that
return
from
respondent.
this
is
not
the
death
knell
to
the
formation
of
the
holding
company
i
would
stress.
i
will
also
stress
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
this
law
which
has
been
in
existence
since
the
early
60's
and
has
been
applied
again
and
again
in
denials
of
holding
company
applications
which
have
been
published.
this
interpretation
has
been
in
existence.
during
the
period
of
time
when
congress
amended
the
law,
it
amended
it
in
1966,
it
amended
it
again
in
1970
and
it
didn't
express
even
the
slightest
disagreement
with
the
board's
policies
and
under
this
board
decision,
this
court's
decisions
when
congress
amends
the
law
without
disagreeing
with
a
visible
and
obvious
policy
of
this
sort
that
amounts
to
ratification
by
congress
of
the
agency's
interpretation
and
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
the
greatest
discretion
is
owing
to
an
administrative
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
enabling
statute
and
that
argument
applies
a
fortiori
we
say
when
there
have
been
two
amendments
of
the
law
without
any
hint
of
disagreement.
and
of
course
this
policy
of
strong
capitalization
has
been
at
the
base
of
the
congressional
concerned
in
this
area
since
1913.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no
your
honor,
no
other
courts
has
and
you'll
notice
that
the
seventh
circuit
relies
upon
general
reasoning
rather
than
the
citation
of
any
precedent
and
that's
because
there
is
no
case
law
in
this
area.
we
have
to
turn
to
the
statute,
its
literal
text
and
its
history
had
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
was
senior
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
senior
judge
hastings
wrote
the
panel
decision
and
judge
fairchild
who
had
dissented
in
the
original
case
wrote
the
decision
for
the
en
banc
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
notice
that
myself
your
honor
with
some
embarrassment
but
those
are
the
authors
of
the
opinions.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
respondent
asserts
that
because
a
capital
deficiency
already
exists
here
that
there
is
no
rational
ground
for
us
to
stand
on
the
way.
that
were
being
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
the
milk
has
already
been
spilled,
the
damage
is
done
they
say
and
there's
no
reason
to
make
a
fuss
but
we
say
that
the
situation
should
be
improved
and
that
new
powers,
a
new
status
should
not
be
conferred
until
that
improvement
takes
place
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
arbitrary
or
capricious
about
that.
the
old
maxim
about
greater
rights,
pre-supposing,
greater
responsibilities
we
think
applies
fully
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
under
the
statute
the
board
is
directed
to
consider
an
every
case
financial
resources
and
the
legislative
history
says
that
these
considerations
of
financial
soundness
and
managerial
soundness,
the
so-called
banking
factors
are
the
basis
for
granting
or
denying
and
if
the
applicant
has
not
shown
sufficient
responsibility
to
raise
capital
to
minimally
adequate
levels,
then
the
statute
we
say
authorizes
a
flat
denial
and
tell
the
applicant
improves
the
condition
of
the
bank
and
meets
minimum
board
standards.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
that
the
white
light
is
on
and
i
would
request
your
leave
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
reply.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
differ
with
mr.
collins
with
great
deference
on
the
question
of
monetary
policy.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
monetary
policy
in
simple
terms.
monetary
policy
is
concerned
with
the
level
of
money
in
the
general
economy
and
it's
regulated
through
open
market
transactions,
reserve
requirements
and
through
the
interest
rate
of
the
discount
window
of
the
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
believe
that
that's
a
separate
question,
your
honor.
the
point
i'd
like
to
make
if
i
may
is
that
this
case
is
dealing
not
with
money
supply
with
the
safety
of
banks.
it's
not
concerned
with
aggregate
demand
of
the
economy
but
with
the
cushion
of
equity
in
the
banking
system
and
mr.
collins
referred
to
mrs.
heller's
treaties,
i
think
if
the
court
reviews
that,
it
will
make
very
clear
that
the
policy
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
capital
cushion
for
bank
safety.
in
1974,
that
became
an
issue
because
banks
were
failing.
there
were
several
large
failures
including
the
franklin
national
bank
and
the
board
decided
that
at
this
point
in
time
that
the
strict
capital
standards
were
essential
to
the
safety
of
the
banking
system.
the
argument
was
made
that
the
board's
opinion
was
too
cursory.
i'll
refer
the
court
briefly
to
camp
versus
pitts,
411
u.s.
138.
this
is
a
case
we
haven't
cited
but
it
deals
with
the
adequacy
of
banking
agency's
opinion
and
denying
an
application.
the
opinion
is
about
three
years
old
of
this
court,
411
u.s.
138.
and
i
would
say
in
closing
that
the
comptroller
does
not
have
the
final
word
here
as
this
court
said
in
the
whitney
national
bank
case,
congress
had
no
intention
to
give
the
comptroller
a
veto
over
the
federal
reserve
board
under
the
federal
bank
holding
company
act.
and
we
think
this
case
should
be
viewed
from
that
perspective
because
the
statute
is
explicit,
that
the
board
makes
this
decision
and
the
comptroller
merely
advises.
thank
you
very
much.
