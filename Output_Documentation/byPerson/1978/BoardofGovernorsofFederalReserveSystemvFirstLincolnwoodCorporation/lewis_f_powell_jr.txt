powell,

mr.
collins,
i
take
it
you're
not
defending
the
judgment
below
on
the
theory
espouse
by
the
seventh
circuit
however?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
not.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
collins.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
interrupt
you
just
a
minute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
difficulty
with
your
argument
you
are
now
making
as
i
perceive
it
is
that
the
comptroller
has
authority
only
to
make
a
recommendation
to
the
federal
reserve
board
with
respect
to
the
formation
of
a
holding
company.
the
congress
made
the
choice
of
putting
the
decision
making
authority
in
the
federal
reserve
board
with
respect
to
a
holding
company.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
comptroller
can
only
--
can
only
make
a
recommendation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
please
do.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that's
true
but
section
3
imposes
obligation
on
the
board
to
consider
the
financial
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
condition
not
only
of
the
bank
but
of
the
holding
company?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
future
prospects
of
both?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
show
that
your
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
on
the
comptroller
seems
to
me
to
be
perhaps
misplaced
to
some
extent.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
it's
relevant
--
it's
relevant
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
but
i'm
talking
about
the
ultimate
responsibility.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no,
sir.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
arguing
--
i
am
--
well,
no,
i
think
its
up
to
the
comptroller
whether
or
not
a
bank
should
open
tomorrow
morning
and
he
makes
that
decision
everyday
as
to
every
bank
in
america
and
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
judicial
decision
unless
there
was
a
case
of
gross
abuse
and
i
don't
know
that
there's
ever
been
such
a
case
but
i
think
that
and
my
point
to
your
honor
is
that
the
decision
of
whether
to
allow
or
to
withhold
the
privilege
of
a
bank
holding
company
is
one
which
is
accorded
or
not
accorded
in
accordance
with
judicial
principles
and
not
as
part
of
the
money
policy
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
collins,
i'm
having
little
difficulty
following
you
when
you
talk
about
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
being
based
on
the
federal
reserve
board's
monetary
policy,
is
that
referred
to
by
the
board
in
its
decision?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
not
really
what
the
board
said
in
this
case
though.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
collins?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i've
read
a
few
of
these
opinions
over
the
years
and
uniformly
the
federal
reserve
board
and
also
the
courts
treat
about
three
basic
elements
in
analyzing
this
request.
the
competitive
factors
are
one,
the
antitrust
division.
second
guess
is
the
board
on
those,
then
the
banking
factors
are
second
package
of
things
but
the
boards
and
courts
look
at.
and
finally,
the
board
looks
at
the
convenience
of
the
community
whether
or
not
the
community
will
be
better
served,
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
so
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
can
say
that
all
the
board
is
concerned
with
is
the
competitive
factor.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
oh
really?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
