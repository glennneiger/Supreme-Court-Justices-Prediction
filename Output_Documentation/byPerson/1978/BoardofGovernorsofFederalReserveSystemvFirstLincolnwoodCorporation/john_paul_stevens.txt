mr.
shapiro,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
if
the
holding
company
were
a
multi-million
dollar
concern,
just
all
cash
and
no-risk
business
in
it,
no
multiple
bank
situation,
you
would
nevertheless
and
if
the
advantage
at
the
results
of
the
formation
of
holding
company
would
be
totally
to
the
benefit
of
the
bank
because
they
get
the
tax
deduction,
they
don't
now
get.
you
would
nevertheless
disapprove
the
application
unless
they
poured
additional
capital
into
the
bank.
justice
john
paul
stevens
otherwise,
it
would
be
paid
to
uncle
sam
in
half,
wouldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
lot
of
those
--
the
dividends
for
the
most
part
you're
talking
about
are
the
product
of
the
tax
saving?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
government's
position
is
that
its
better
to
have
that
money
go
to
the
government
really.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
position
is
based
entirely
on
the
statutory
language
that
the
board
shall
take
in
to
consideration
the
financial
and
managerial
resources
of
future
prospects
of
the
company
or
companies
in
the
banks
concerned.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
there
of
course
you're
talking
about
membership
in
the
system
of
banks
all
of
which
affect
one
another
in
their
operation;
we
don't
have
any
consideration
like
that
here,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
government
still
concede
as
it
did,
at
least
judge
fairchild
have
quoted
you
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
saying
that
in
any
economic
analysis
of
this,
the
formation
of
the
new
company
can
only
be
beneficial
to
the
bank
can't
cause
any
harm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
can't
point
to
any
harm
other
than
the
failure
to
do
something
you
wanted
to
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
of
which
would
have
applied
if
there've
been
no
bank
holding
company
involved
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
was
a
situation
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
in
which
they
did
not
maintain
the
80%
necessary
to
take
advantage
of
the
tax
advantage
which
is
the
whole
purpose
of
this
transaction,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i'm
sorry
i'm
confused.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
i
just
want
to
clear
one
thing
up
in
my
mind.
you
mentioned
that
if
you
had
to
get
a
cease
and
desist
order
in
under
capitalization
situations,
it
should
be
engaged
in
almost
constant
litigation
because
i
gather
from
that
and
is
this
a
correct
inference
that
the
problem
of
banks
not
complying
with
your
8%
rule
is
a
very
common
problem,
a
lot
of
banks
don't
comply
with
it,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
400?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
400
applications
in
which
the
acquired
banks
capitalization
didn't
meet
the
8%
test
and
that
was
the
reason
for
denial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
if
there
---
if
there
are
400
banks
that
this
was
a
problem
and
that
it
were
subject
to
application,
i
presume
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
other
banks
that
weren't
involved
in
proposed
transaction
that
also
were
deficient
in
capital,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
--
that
maybe
it's
almost
a
characteristic
of
the
banking
industry
that
they
don't
satisfy
this
particular
criteria?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
a
flat
rule
of
the
board
that
no
one
bank
holding
company
will
be
permitted
to
be
organized
if
the
bank
to
be
acquired
has
a
capital
ratio
of
less
than
8%?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
rule
contained
in
a
written
regulation
anywhere?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
basically
what
they
do?
they
never
allow
any
change
in
status
or
anything
to
the
bank
unless
it
will
make
a
change
to
comply
with
this
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
bank
lose
their
fdic
insurance
when
they
get
below
this
amount?
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
the
bank
lose
its
fdic
insurance
coverage
if
its
capital
ratio
falls
below
this
percentage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
won't
grant
new
insurance
to
a
bank
that
doesn't
comply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
of
course
in
the
denial
or
the
application
has
not
achieve
the
end,
i
gather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
still
as
under
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
fdic
wins
the
litigation
then
its
objective
will
not
be
achieved?
