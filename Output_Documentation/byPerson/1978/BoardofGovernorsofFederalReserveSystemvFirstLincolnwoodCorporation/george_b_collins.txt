mr.
george
b.
collins
may
it
please
your
--
may
it
please
the
chief
judge
in
this
honorable
court.
the
transaction
here
involved
does
not
change
anything
except
for
the
better.
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
chicago
wrote
an
analysis
of
this
transaction
which
was
quite
full
and
which
pointed
out
that
the
--
i
think
their
exact
language
was
that
the
bank
would
be
severely
prejudice
or
severely
hindered
if
the
transaction
were
not
allowed.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
by
this
transaction,
by
the
formation
of
this
holding
company,
the
bank
will
or
the
entity
consisting
of
the
bank
and
its
owners
will
benefit
by
$130,000.00
per
year.
right
now,
the
amount
would
be
a
$160,000.00
a
year
because
it's
based
upon
the
current
average
interest
rate.
now,
if
the
court
please
that
is
a
large
benefit
and
that
is
why
the
bank
sought
holding
company
status.
in
illinois,
having
a
bank
holding
company,
a
one
bank
holding
company
is
of
no
particular
great
benefit
from
a
business
point
of
view.
you
can't
open
branch
banks
with
it.
you
can't
have
multiple
holding
company
banks.
you
can't
do
anything
with
it
except
really
do
what
the
voting
trust
does
now.
now,
the
bank
has
a
voting
trust
right
now
where
the
four
men
who
were
involved
belong
to
this
voting
trust
and
that
voting
trust
does
exactly
what
the
holding
company
will
do
which
is
sit
there
and
vote
every
year
at
the
time
of
election
of
directors
and
receive
a
dividend
and
use
the
dividend
to
pay
interest
on
the
loan
which
exists.
now,
in
this
transaction,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
new
created
by
the
transaction,
there
is
only
a
reshaping
in
form
from
a
voting
trust
to
a
holding
company
which
will
perform
precisely
the
same
function
as
the
voting
trust.
so
there
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
collins
that
--
i
am,
i
do.
i
do
contend
that
judge
fairchild
wrote
correctly.
i
contend
that
judge
fairchild
wrote
correctly
when
he
said
that
in
order
to
strike
down
a
transaction
or
to
deny
a
transaction,
there
must
be
something
about
that
transaction
which
in
some
manner
causes
some
detriment
to
some
banking
factor.
the
board
denies
this
your
honor
on
the
basis
of
a
policy
decision,
a
basic
economic
policy
decision
and
i
think
in
that
respect,
i
differ
very
much
with
counsel.
counsel
puts
that
to
your
honor
here
today
that
the
board
has
the
right
under
their
reading
of
the
statute
to
decide
basic
economic
policy
to
fix
an
8%
rate
which
they
affix
no
place
in
any
written
regulation.
they
have
not
one
piece
of
paper,
not
one
thing
that's
published
as
a
regulation
that
i
know
of
says
8%.
they
have
the
right
to
say
that
and
then
to
deny
on
the
basic
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
they
might
have
the
power
to
make
such
a
regulation.
mr.
george
b.
collins
but
they
surely
haven't
made
such
a
regulation.
the
--
i
don't
know
that
they
have
the
power.
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
this
that
they
have
the
power
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
--
only
to
relate
it
to
the
specific
transaction.
is
this
transaction
a
good
one
or
a
bad
one?
now,
if
your
honor
please,
the
board
has
many
powers,
the
power
over
money
policy
united
states
which
does
not
involve
hearings,
it
does
not
involve
a
record.
they
meet
once
a
week
and
decide
if
we're
going
to
be
richer
or
poorer
whatever
they
decide.
but
that
is
not
what
this
is.
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
judicial
type
decision
where
you
take
a
record
in
a
case
and
decide
yes
or
no.
mr.
george
b.
collins
if
they
do,
it
does
not
appear
from
their
opinions.
they
simply
say
that
in
this
instance,
we
think
there
would
be
a
strain
on
the
bank's
--
on
the
bank's
capital
or
that
in
this
instance
there
would
be
no
strain.
you
can't
read
their
opinions
and
come
a
way
with
any
understanding
of
any
policy
other
than
that,
sometimes
they
say
it
will
cause
its
strain
and
sometimes
they
say
it
won't.
it
is
--
they're
not
written
like
judicial
opinions.
one
of
them
is
here
and
many
are
cited
in
the
brief.
they
are
not
judicial
opinions.
they
don't
appear
to
be
even.
they
don't
really
go
with
precedent.
they
simply
say
that
this
is
a
strain
and
that's
not.
in
this
instance,
i
would
suggest
that
the
primary
regulation
of
a
bank
is
sue
the
comptroller
of
currency.
and
i
think
it
important
that
the
court
understand
that
banks
are
heavily
regulated
by
a
most
responsible
and
competent
regulatory
authority.
there
are
basically
three,
the
fdic,
the
comptroller
of
currency
and
the
state
banking
authority.
in
this
instance
it's
a
comptroller
because
it's
a
national
bank
and
a
member
of
the
federal
reserve
system
i
would
add.
mr.
george
b.
collins
no,
no
sir,
not
--
please
don't
put
me
on
that,
no
sir.
they
had
authority
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
george
b.
collins
no,
they
had
the
authority
to
decide
the
case
but
this
is
how
it
is
suppose
to
work
according
to
the
statute.
the
bank
applies
or
the
holding
company
applies.
the
comptroller
is
then
asked
to
pass
judgment
upon
it
before
the
frb
does.
the
comptroller
--
if
the
comptroller
says
no
because
the
banking
factors
are
adverse,
then
you
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
federal
reserve
board
or
some
delegate
thereof.
if
the
comptroller
says
yes
on
banking
factors,
then
you
still
have
the
competitive
factors,
the
antitrust
factors
that
must
then
be
decided
and
the
board
can
then
decide
the
case
on
the
antitrust
and
competitive
factors
and
review
the
comptroller
on
the
so-called
banking
factors.
now,
as
congress
wrote
and
as
it
would
appear
to
me
to
have
been
intended
to
be
written
and
as
chairman
burns
said
when
it
was
--
when
the
1971
bank
holding
company
act
was
passed,
the
federal
reserve
board
does
not
pretend
to
want
to
regulate
what
goes
on
inside
a
bank
and
mr.
burns
said
that
--
governor
burns
said
that.
he
said,
“we
don't
want
to
regulate
banks,
that's
up
to
the
comptroller.”
now,
the
comptroller
has
plenary
powers
over
banks.
they
have
vast
and
enormous
powers.
it's
not
some
involved
court
thing.
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
the
government's
reply
brief
here.
the
malone
case
i
believe
gives
an
example
of
the
breadth
of
that
power.
they
can
go
on
a
bank
and
say
you're
closed
and
you
are.
it's
really
very
little
you
can
do
about
it.
you
go
to
a
hearing
later.
so
the
comptroller
has
very
full
powers
to
do
as
he
wishes
with
the
bank
and
he
has
the
primary
responsibility
and
in
this
instance,
the
comptroller
exercise
a
very
basic
primary
responsibility
and
said,
after
there
was
a
change,
go
ahead.
the
ironic
thing
is
that
the
change
the
comptroller
proposed,
the
federal
reserve
board
didn't
like.
they
said,
one
of
the
items
in
the
record
here
says
that
the
federal
reserve
board
regards
it
as
less
--
less
favorable
that
the
changes
that
the
comptroller
required
is
making
the
proposition
less
favorable.
so
you
have
the
situation
where
you
have
essentially
two
regulatory
bodies
having
input
into
one
decision.
but
its
suppose
to
be
a
judicial
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
pardon
me.
mr.
george
b.
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
collins
very
much
so.
mr.
george
b.
collins
may
i
respond
on
that
point
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
collins
the
comptroller
has
the
--
has
the
duty
to
respond
to
the
application.
he
may
respond
yes
or
no.
if
he
responds
yes,
then
it
is
decided
by
the
federal
reserve
board
without
any
hearing.
they
simply
take
the
papers,
the
documents
that
are
presented.
if
the
comptrollers
says
no,
then
the
federal
reserve
board
is
obliged
to
grant
a
hearing.
my
point
is
that
some
status
is
given
by
that
statutory
scheme
to
the
comptrollers
acquiescence
or
non-acquiescence
and
the
comptroller
remains
in
all
events
the
primary
regulatory
authority
over
the
bank
and
the
federal
reserve
board
does
not
pretend
according
to
its
chairman
at
one
point
to
govern
what
goes
on
inside
a
bank
or
to
concern
itself
with
the
day
to
day
capitalization
of
the
bank.
now,
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
correct.
mr.
george
b.
collins
correct.
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
there
are
ways
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
if
your
honor
thinks
so
then
certainly
misplaced
but
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
but
the
point
that
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
but
the
point
that
i
would
make
is
that
the
decision
that
they're
to
make
is
suppose
to
be
a
judicial
decision
and
not
an
economic
decision.
that
the
federal
reserve
board
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
that
it's
a
statute.
that
it
impose
an
obligation
to
decide
the
competitive
factors.
that
it
comes
out
of
the
bank
merger
act.
it's
taken
whole
right
out
of
the
bank
merger
act.
the
legislative
history
to
which
counsel
adverts
just
doesn't
exist
for
this
statute
except
through
the
bank
merger
act.
are
you
arguing
that
financial
condition
of
a
bank
is
a
judicial
decision
rather
than
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
--
an
economic
or
banking
decision.
mr.
george
b.
collins
correct.
mr.
george
b.
collins
i
have
--
i
have
no
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
right.
mr.
george
b.
collins
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
because
to
me,
what
that
means
is
that
you
view
this
case
in
this
record
and
if
there's
anything
about
this
transaction
which
harms
anyone
of
those
considerations
or
does
not
even
or
you
could
even
say
does
not
benefit
the
situation
upon
this
considerations
that
it
is
entirely
proper
for
the
board
to
take
that
into
consideration.
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
certainly.
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
certainly
but
the
point
is
that
in
this
case,
they
are
denying
this
status,
i
suggest
as
part
of
their
basic
monetary
policy
of
the
united
states
and
not
because
of
anything
good,
better
and
different
about
this
case.
now,
i
think
that's
a
difference
between
the
open
market
committee
or
the
money
type
actions
of
the
board
and
this
particular
item.
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
that's
what
they
in
their
opinion
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
they
claim
in
their
opinion
which
is
in
the
petition.
they
take
the
position
that
because
the
owner
of
this
bank,
the
holding
company
will
owe
money
which
already
owed
and
has
been
owed
for
three,
four
years
now.
because
the
old
money
that
the
holding
company
could
--
that
this
debt
could
prevent
the
holding
company
from
resolving
any
unforeseen
problems
that
may
arise
at
the
bank,
that
the
language
right
out
of
their
opinion
at
26
(a)
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
now,
if
it
is
the
point
of
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
and
i
believe
it
to
be
correct,
i
hope
it
is,
that
they
have
to
see
something
wrong
with
this
transaction,
with
this
particular
transaction
some
way
in
which
this
transaction
is
harmed
by
a
holding
company
status
before
they
can
deny
the
benefit
of
a
$160,000
a
year
tax
saving
to
this
ownership
entity
now.
the
ownership
entity
exists
right
now
and
right
now
it
owes
$3.7
million.
if
there's
a
holding
company,
they
still
owe
it
--
they
still
owe
it
personally
because
they
have
to
guarantee
the
note
as
the
lender
would
require
and
does
require.
so
nothing
changes
except
that
there's
a
$160,000.00
benefit
per
year
that
goes
towards
reducing
that
debt.
that's
$160,000.00,
it
doesn't
--
its
not
created
now.
so
essentially,
what
is
done
here
by
the
federal
reserve
board
is
they
are
saying
that
the
tax
laws
of
the
united
states
may
--
you
may
not
have
the
benefit
of
this
tax
law
because
you
didn't
do
something
else
that
we
want
you
to
do
which
in
our
monetary
policy,
we
believe
you
should
do.
now,
their
monetary
policy
is
not
really
written
because
it
changes
so
much.
there
is
evidence
in
a
book
that
the
government
cites
called
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
i
would
hope
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
let
me
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
i
think
that's
the
difference
between
this
court
in
any
judicial
body
and
an
administrative
body
and
i'll
agree
with
your
honor
that
they'll
have
a
hard
time
doing
that
but
i
think
they
have
the
obligation
when
they
have
a
judicial
decision
to
make
which
this
is.
mr.
george
b.
collins
the
legislative
history
if
i
may,
the
legislative
history
is
that
this
is
a
judicial
type
decision
and
a
judicial
type
decision
means
you
got
to
be
fair
to
both
sides
and
act
equally
among
all
parties
and
that's
what
a
judicial
decision
is.
mr.
george
b.
collins
but
in
an
open
market
money
committee
meeting
at
the
federal
reserve
board,
there's
no
plaintiff
and
no
defendant
and
they
simply
decide
on
the
basis
of
some
administrative
rule
what
they're
doing.
mr.
george
b.
collins
what
was
done
here,
what
is
wrong
is
done
here
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
not
at
all.
the
obligation
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
alright,
the
obligation
of
the
federal
reserve
board
is
they
could
definitely
i
think
overrule
the
--
suppose
the
comptroller
had
a
bank
that
was
in
a
failing
condition
and
he
said
well,
start
a
holding
company
and
that'll
pull
it
out.
i
think
they
definitely
have
a
function
here
but
they
have
to
exercise
it
in
a
judicial
and
not
economic
manner.
it's
been
documented
that
the
federal
reserves
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
it
is
in
this
instance
--
when
they're
exposed
to
make
a
judicial
decision
and
decide
between
parties
on
the
basis
of
a
record,
they're
suppose
to
do
it
so
fairly
and
i
think
that
that's
different
from
their
general
administrative
responsibility
over
the
money
systems.
mr.
george
b.
collins
parties
would
be
the
applicant
and
the
respondent
which
should
be
the
staff
of
the
federal
reserve
board
which
shows
to
go
against
this.
they
made
a
submission
against
it
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
not
in
--
in
the
administrative
law
context,
i
think
it
might
be
considered
that
the
federal
reserve
board
of
chicago
strongly
recommended
this
and
the
strongest
of
term,
they
said
it
was
the
bank
would
suffer
severe
detriment
if
it
were
not
granted.
the
people
at
staff
here,
of
course
we
don't
know
that
as
it
goes
through,
you
only
learn
that
when
you
get
the
record
but
the
staff
here
said
no,
they
didn't
like
it
because
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
current
posture
was
their
words.
the
current
posture
of
the
board,
the
current
policy
of
the
board
and
so
they
said
this
doesn't
comply
with
our
current
policy.
alright,
then
the
board
has
to
decide
what's
right
and
what's
wrong
and
i
think
that
when
they
decide
that,
they're
deciding
between
two
contentions.
mr.
george
b.
collins
no
it
is
not.
i
based
that
upon
an
analysis
in
a
book
that
the
government
cites
called
heller,
a
guidebook
to
holding
company
law.
its
--
i
believe
page
128
to
130
of
that
book
which
i
just
read
yesterday
and
which
says
plainly
that
up
until
1974,
they
were
very
liberal
with
the
formation
of
this
holding
companies
and
they
intended
to
approve
them.
then,
in
1974
when
there
was
economic
difficulty
in
the
country,
they
decided
that
they
will
change
their
policy
and
attempt
to
get
more
money
into
the
banking
system
by
refusing
the
holding
companies
and
by
making
the
banks
come
up
with
more
money
in
order
to
start
them.
now,
mr.
shapiro
this
morning,
my
good
friend
here
argues
that
their
right
because
they
have
the
right
to
require
more
money
simply
as
part
of
their
general
governance
of
the
american
economic
system
but
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
--
it
was
the
observation
of
their
author
of
that
book
that
whatever
they
said
in
their
opinions,
what
they
do
is
they
decide
things
on
the
basis
of
policy.
now,
the
internal
board
report
which
is
the
staff
report
to
the
board
which
is
in
the
appendix
uses
the
words
current
posture.
counsel
argues
here
today
forcibly
that
it
is
policy
that
causes
them
to
do
this
and
if
they
have
the
right
to
deny
this
tax
advantage
because
of
policy
that
banks
should
have
more
capital.
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
my
point
is
that
should
be
at
least
some
kind
of
written
policy
that
someone
can
know
and
for
them
to
simply
to
deny
it
on
the
basis
of
a
record
when
in
fact
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
nothing
but
benefit
flows
from
it.
i
think
that
there
--
i
think
that's
just
plain
arbitrary
wrong
and
capricious
because
when
the
problem
will
be
on
its
way
to
being
solve
if
they
will
grant
the
holding
company
status
which
in
illinois
means
nothing
as
far
as
other
business
are
concern.
if
they
were
but
granted,
then
we're
a
$160,000.00
a
year
towards
solving
every
problem
that
there
is.
if
they
deny
it,
we
aren't.
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
if
they
--
if
that
policy
were
applied
to
this
case,
they
would
grant
the
holding
company
because
when
four
people
own
stock
that's
tied
up
for
many
years
that
is
not
readily
salable
because
its
closely
held
and
where
they
have
to
keep
the
80%
block
together
to
qualify
for
the
tax
consideration,
then
in
this
case
it
wouldn't
--
the
application
of
such
a
policy
would
leave
them
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
position.
what
--
i
don't
know
what
the
deciders
of
great
questions
consider.
i
have
never
decided
anything.
but
to
me,
if
they
have
a
record
before
them,
they
should
decide
their
case
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
them
and
upon
the
harm
or
good
to
be
done
out
of
that
transaction.
mr.
george
b.
collins
i
would
think
so.
you
so
judge
if
a
man
does
an
armed
robbery,
you
judge
the
one
transaction;
you
don't
convict
him
because
of
a
general
policy
on
that.
mr.
george
b.
collins
well,
i
think
in
this
instance,
the
way
the
statute
and
the
procedure
is
written.
i
think
they
have
the
duty
of
deciding
any
two
antitrust
questions
and
i
think
you
could
consider
this
part
as
part
of
the
antitrust
consideration
or
you
can
consider
separately.
now,
in
the
third
national
bank
case
which
was
written
and
decided
in
this
court
11
years
ago,
the
same
language
out
of
the
bank
merger
act
was
held
to
apply
it
to
the
specific
transaction
as
viewed
through
antitrust
or
an
antitrust
prospective.
so
this
language
has
been
precisely
interpreted
in
that
statute
as
having
to
do
only
with
the
antitrust
considerations
of
the
case
and
having
to
do
only
with
that
specific
circumstance
and
not
otherwise.
now,
--
mr.
george
b.
collins
yes.
mr.
george
b.
collins
i
was
pointing
out
if
your
honor
please
that
the
same
language
in
the
bank
merger
act,
it
has
exactly
the
same
language.
mr.
george
b.
collins
has
been
so
interpreted
by
this
court.
mr.
george
b.
collins
i
agree
that
the
federal
reserve
board
certainly
looks
at
it
as
your
honor
describes.
mr.
george
b.
collins
but
the
bank
merger
act
was
not
so
construed
in
the
third
national
bank
case
from
which
where
this
involved
banks
at
national
tennessee.
it
just
--
was
done
differently
and
i
want
to
bring
up
one
other
point.
in
the
legislative
history
argument,
they
go
back
to
statutes
--
to
a
statute
passed
in
1933
which
would
appear
to
require
the
holder
of
bank
stock
if
a
corporation
to
have
certain
financial
standing.
well,
if
your
honors
please,
that
was
because
in
the
1930's,
there
was
a
law
that
said
that
bank
stockholders
were
personally
liable
on
their
bank
stock
to
the
extent
to
the
par
value
of
that
stock
in
case
the
bank
fail.
now,
there
was
such
a
law
once
upon
a
time.
it
was
--
its
section
64
of
the
national
banking
act
and
in
64
(a)
repeals
that
as
to
bank
stock
acquired
after
some
day
back
in
the
1940's
and
it
is
no
longer
the
law.
now,
there
was
once
a
very
real
and
precise
reasoning
--
reason
for
requiring
the
owner
of
bank
stock
to
have
a
certain
financial
status.
now,
the
board
here
tries
to
make
that
old
law
back
into
the
law
by
saying
that
the
owner
of
bank
stock
if
it's
a
corporation
should
have
a
lot
of
money
so
that
if
there
is
trouble
at
the
bank
they
can
come
up
with
the
money
and
that's
what
they
say
in
the
opinion
in
this
case,
that
they
want
the
applicant,
the
holding
company
to
have
money
to
come
up
with.
if
the
--
if
that
isn't
the
law
anymore,
the
owner
of
bank
stock
can
own
nothing
except
that
bank
stock
if
he's
an
individual,
he
can
be
as
poor
as
can
be
and
its
not
against
the
law
to
own
bank
stock
no
matter
how
poor
you
are
in
other
matters.
you
can
only
own
that
stock
and
you
can
owe
on
it
to
a
100%
of
its
worth
and
you
can
still
lawfully
own
it.
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
that
counsel
cites
is
undercut
by
the
fact
that
in
the
initial
writing
of
the
laws
on
this
subject,
there
was
then
existent,
this
law
requiring
that
you
make
up
any
loss
in
a
bank
if
you're
a
stock
holder
to
the
extent
of
the
par
value
of
that.
if
the
court
please,
we
contend
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
right
that
if
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference.
if
this
transaction
does
not
harm
anyone
and
that
it
is
a
correct
transaction
and
i
thank
you
all.
