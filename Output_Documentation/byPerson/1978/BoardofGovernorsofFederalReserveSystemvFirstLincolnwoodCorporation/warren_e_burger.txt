mr.
shapiro,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
by
that
question
is
whether
they
have
the
authority
to
do
it
or
whether
they
have
the
discretion
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
not
some
value
to
the
guarantees
resulting
from
the
holding
company
act,
from
a
holding
company
status?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
criteria
do
you
suggest
were
taken
into
account
by
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
chicago
in
recommending
approval
of
this
application?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
about
the
comptroller's
view
of
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
where
--
how
do
you
relate
that
specifically
to
the
statute,
that
doctrine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
board
had
no
authority
to
deal
--
make
this
decision
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
said
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
had
that
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
between
the
parties,
who
are
those
parties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
not
a
party
situation
in
the
normal
context
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
the
federal
reserve
board
and
looking
down
the
road
is
their
business
includes
that
anything
that
will
encourage
speculation
and
bank
stocks
at
a
particular
time
is
bad
for
the
whole
monetary
system,
then
do
you
say
they
cannot
take
that
policy
into
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
for
this
one
transaction
and
this
mean
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
the
federal
reserve
board
has
got
to
somewhat
different
function,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
collins.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
three
minutes,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
you
say
--
how
would
you
say
that
relates
it
all
to
the
desirability
or
undesirability
of
speculation
and
bank
stocks
at
any
particular
period?
are
there
some
nexus
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the

in
board
of
governors
