it
discharges
the
price,
in
other
words,
for
somebody
who
wants
to
form
a
single
bank
holding
company
and
get
the
tax
advantages
of
that,
he
has
to
pay
the
price
by
improving
the
capitalization
of
the
bank.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
the
capitalization
of
the
bank
was
unchanged
--
would
be
unchanged
absent
board
action,
whether
or
not
it
was
owned
as
before
by
individual
owners
or
owned
thereafter
by
a
holding
company.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
shapiro,
having
interrupted
you,
may
i
ask
you
this
which
doesn't
seem
to
be
very
clear
from
my
reading
of
the
briefs
at
least.
do
the
individual
owners,
if
this
should
become
a
holding
company,
do
the
individual
owners
remain
guarantors
of
the
debt?
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
so,
if
that's
true,
the
situation
remains
as
before
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
stability
of
that
indebtedness
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
any
advantage
of
the
holding
company
however
is
light
as
in
that
advantage
then,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no
improvement
in
the
capitalization
of
the
bank
and
there
wouldn't
have
been,
had
there
been
no
holding
company.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
price
--
as
a
price
for
this
people
getting
the
tax
advantage
of
forming
of
one
bank
holding
company,
what
do
you
get
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
condition.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
in
illinois.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
your
answer
is
accurate
that
the
original
owners
here
remain
as
guarantors
of
the
indebtedness
then
there
is
the
advantage
of
now
there
being
two
sets
of
debtors
instead
of
just
one.
justice
potter
stewart
the
holding
company
is
now
added
as
an
additional
debtor.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
original
debtors
remain
debtors,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
assumed
the
indebtedness,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there's
an
additional
debtor?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
shapiro,
has
any
other
court
--
considered
this
question
in
any
court
other
than
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
one
more
question,
who
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
panel?
justice
potter
stewart
september
7,
1976,
it
doesn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
appear
who
the
author
was
of
the
panel
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
go
on.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
the
power
to
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
argument.
they
probably
have
the
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
you
say
they
don't?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
except,
except
mr.
collins,
maybe
i'm
simply
repeating
the
concern
expressed
by
my
brother
powell
but
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
clearly
provides
that
in
every
case,
that
is
in
every
application
to
become
a
bank
holding
company,
the
board
shall
take
into
consideration
the
financial
and
managerial
resources
of
the
banks
concerned.
justice
potter
stewart
it
imposes
a
statutory
duty
upon
the
board
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
every
case
to
take
those
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
concerns
into
consideration.
justice
potter
stewart
or
has
to
in
every
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
rule
of
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
board
simply
says
we
took
into
consideration
the
financial
resources
of
the
bank
concerned.
justice
potter
stewart
at
which
was
congress
directed
us
to
do
in
every
case.
