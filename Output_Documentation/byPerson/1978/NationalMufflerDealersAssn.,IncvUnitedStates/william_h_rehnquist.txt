justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
no
general
statute
or
statutory
exemption
for
a
non-profit
corporations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
section
one
above
16
or
17
different
sub/categories
or
groups
that
are
exempted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
think
about
a
baseball
league
under
that
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
with
this
regulation
that
you
handed
up
adopted,
do
you
know?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
of
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i’m
trying
to
get
at
is
the
contemporariness
of
the
regulation.
to
me
what
it
have
make
a
more
of
an
impression
if
the
regulation
had
been
adopted
simultaneously
with
the
statute
than
if
it
were
changed
say
forty
years
later,
and
you
suggest
it
is,
if
it
was
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
going
to
answer
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
right
now.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
but
if
you
are
going
to
ask
--
answer
his,
i
was
not
going
to
ask
you
mine,
if
you
are
not
going
to
answer
his
now,
i
will
ask
mine.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
after
(inaudible)
gone
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
in
1966
it
didn’t
include
the
american
football
league?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
if
you
finish
out
that
third
sentence
in
the
regulation,
after
the
words
more
lines
of
business,
you
go
on
to
the
language
as
distinguished
from
the
performance
of
particular
services
for
individual
persons,
which
i
take
it
is
what
is
not
permitted
in
exemption.
what
are
some
examples
of
the
performance
of
particular
services
for
individual
person?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
the
muffler
dealers
association
here
falls
under
the
head
of
performance
of
particular
services
for
individual
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
a
two-part
test?
i
would
have
read
that
sentence
as
just
meaning
these
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
fall
on
one
side
and
these
are
the
things
that
fall
on
the
other,
not
that
you
have
to
go
through
both
a
and
b
in
order
to
qualify.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
quiet
difficult
to
read
it
otherwise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
reason
do
those
courts
give
for
the
inclusion
of
the
words
as
distinguished
from,
if
they
are
correct
in
their
reasoning?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
that’s
another
two
part
test
really.
it’s
just
illustrative
on
the
one
hand
and
illustrative
on
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
what
if
you
had
a
ford
dealers
association,
would
that
be
denied
the
exemption
because
it
excluded
the
chevrolet
dealers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
has
to
be
an
automobile
–
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
can
for
instance,
chrysler
dealers
or
american
motor
dealers
association
have
quite
different
common
problems
than
chevrolet
dealers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
am
surprised
you
haven't
excluded
automobile
association
because
they
don’t
include
the
railroads.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
feel
they
should
have
had
affirmative
action
policy?[attempt
to
laughter]
