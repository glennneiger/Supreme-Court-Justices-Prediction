justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
take
the
same
position,
if
the
regulation
had
always
been
like
it
is
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
long
is
the
statute
been
interpreted
and
applied
as
the
government
is
seeking
to
interpret
and
apply
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
since
1929?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
from
the
very
outset
that
it
had
interrupted
and
applied
the
law
this
way
and
the
revenue
code
had
gone
through
all
the
changes
that
it
has
gone
through
since
then
and
the
statute
was
never
amended.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
may
be
that
if
the
commissioner
could
have
applied
it
the
way
--
from
the
outset
the
way
he
now
wants
to
apply
it
that
just
at
1929
he
changed
his
mind
and
you
had
a
good
many
cases
where
government
officials
have
changed
their
mind
and
both
interpretations
have
been
within
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
if
he
has
power
to
issue
regulations,
he
has
power
to
issue
regulations
and
his
regulation
reflects
one
view
of
the
statute,
doesnâ€™t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commissioner
obviously
never
acquiesced
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
in
every
other
circuit
he
was
still
applying
the
law
the
way
he
read
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
(inaudible)
non-acquiescence
in
the
seventh
circuit?
