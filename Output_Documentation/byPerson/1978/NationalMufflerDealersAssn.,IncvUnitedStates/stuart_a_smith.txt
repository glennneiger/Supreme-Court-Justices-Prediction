mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
the
petitioner
denies
it,
we
see
the
import
of
his
argument
as
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
treasury
regulation
that
has
been
outstanding
for
almost
fifty
years.
the
regulation
in
question
is
set
forth
at
page
37
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
i
shall.
the
regulation
says
a
business
league
is
an
association
of
persons
having
some
common
business
interest
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
promote
such
common
interest
and
not
to
engage
in
regular
business
of
a
kind
ordinarily
carried
on
for
profit.
the
petitioner
would
stop
here.
the
regulation
however
goes
on
to
say
it
is
an
organization
of
the
same
general
class
as
a
chamber
of
commerce
or
board
of
trade,
thus
its
activity
should
be
directed
to
the
improvement
of
business
conditions
of
one
or
lines
of
business
as
distinguished
from
the
performance
of
particular
services
for
individual
persons.
now
the
court
has
said
on
making
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
will
be
happy
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
will
answer
his
and
then
i
will
turn
to
you.
the
regulation
that
my
brother
has
said
it
and
distributed
to
the
court
was
issued
under
the
revenue
act
of
1918
and
stood
outstanding
until
the
revenue
act
--
through
the
revenue
act
of
1926.
in
1928,
congress
added
the
phrase,
real-estate
boards
and
the
board
of
tax
appeals
in
the
interim
–
well,
two
things
happened.
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
issued
a
legal
opinion
which
we
set
for
the
page
20
of
our
brief
l.o.1121,
which
discussed
the
general
construction
of
the
statute
and
it
held
there
that
a
stock
exchange
was
not
a
tax
exempt
business
league.
three
years
later
as
we
point
out,
the
board
of
tax
appeals
ruled
that
a
corporation
organized
by
associations
of
insurance
companies
to
provide
printing
services
to
their
member
companies
was
not
in
a
exempt
business
league
and
in
so
holding
the
board
said
that
a
business
league
to
be
entitled
to
the
exemption
should
be
engaged
in
a
limited
two
activities
similar
to
those
of
the
ordinary
chamber
of
commerce
or
broad
of
trade.
the
regulate
--
as
a
result
of
that
decision
as
we
say
in
the
brief,
the
commissioner
revised
the
regulation
to
its
present
form
in
order
to
incorporate
what
we
see
as
the
correct
construction
of
the
statute
and
has
been
the
outstanding
construction
of
the
statute
for
almost
fifty
years
and
that
is
that
the
statute
talks
about
business
leagues,
chambers
of
commerce,
real-estate
boards
and
broads
of
trade
and
that
those
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
professional
footballs
leagues
came
in
1966.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
can
address
that
separately.
professional
football
league
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
but
we
have
another
footnote,
nine.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
old
regulations
mr.
justice
blackmun
or
the
history
of
the
regulations
are
discussed
in
detail
in
the
produce
exchange
dealers
case,
which
is
the
old
second
circuit
case
of
judge
swan
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
in
this
case.
i
didn’t
–
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
not
in
the
same
detail
no,
but
i
think
the
point
simply
is
that
commissioner
in
1929
construed
this
--
changed
his
mind
as
mr.
justice
white
put
it
and
that
is
that
intent
of
congress
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
is
that
this
statute
came
in
the
1913
at
the
behest
of
united
states
chamber
of
commerce
emphasizing
the
quasi
public
civic
nature
of
these
broad
based
organizations,
organizations
that
are
supposed
to
benefit
a
board
spectrum
of
the
business
community
and
in
1929
the
commissioner
recognized
that
was
the
intent
of
the
statute.
in
fact
it's
really
demonstrated
inferentially
from
the
way
that
congress
added
real-estate
boards
to
the
statute
in
1928
because
the
real-estate
board
people
came
in
and
said
you
know
we
are
just
like
chambers
of
commerce.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
as
we
do
and
if
we
haven’t
done
so
in
detail
i
regret
it.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
because
mr.
justice
marshal
it's
engaged
in
a
business
as
the
regulation
says
of
regular
business
of
kind
ordinarily
carried
on
for
profit.
it’s
not
simply
greatest
for
the
country.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
mr.
gordon
touched
on
it
in
part.
my
understanding
of
the
tax
treatment
of
sports
leagues
is
that
sports
leagues
generally
if
you
know
the
are
board
based
enough
to
cover
you
know
a
wide
spectrum
of
major
sports
activity
have
been
given
an
exemption
under
this
statute.
however
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
you
know
the
american
league
i
would
think
–
i’m
talking
about
you
baseball
leagues
and
things
like
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
[voice
overlap]
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
so
although
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
[attempt
to
laughter]
the
shape
of
the
ball
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no
baseballs
leagues
have
enjoyed
the
exemption.
now
what
happened
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
sorry.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
added
football
league
specially
it’s
my
understanding
because
the
national
football
league
operates
a
pension
plan
or
the
football
league
and
it
was,
there
was
some
concern
expressed
as
to
whether
the
pension
plan
constituted
an
inurnment
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
and
that
might
be
disqualified
under
that
basis.
as
a
result,
in
1966,
congress
added
the
phrase,
all
professional
football
leagues
whether
or
not
administering
a
pension
fund
for
football
players.
in
order
to
clarify
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
not
aware
that
baseball
leagues
do.
my
understanding
is
that,
pension
plans
and
baseball
leagues
maybe
administered
by
the
individual
teams.
i
am
not
aware
of
who
administers
the
pension.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
the
pension
plan,
you
know
it
might
be
considered
to
be
an
inurnment
for--
no
that’s
not
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that’s
right.
my
understanding
is
it
that,
that
was
the
reason
for
the
insertion
of
the
provision
for
football
leagues,
but
putting
all
that
aside,
i
mean,
you
know
whether
--i
don’t
think
that
this
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
they
do
in
the
sense
that
i
think
it
was
germane
in
this
case.
they
do
in
the
sense
that
they
don’t
exclude
a
large
spectrum
of
the
relevant
business
community
the
way
the
practitioner
does
here.
in
other
words,
the
national
football
league
sort
of
includes
you
know
a
whole
gamut
of
teams.
it
doesn’t
include
everybody
who
plays
football,
but
it
includes
the
major
football
activity.
here
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
but
that
was
a
separate
league
as
i
understand.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
discord.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
i
am
not
saying
that
it’s
entirely
--
i
am
not
saying
that
it’s
very
simple
and
i
would
like
to
turn
actually
to
this
case
in
a
way
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it’s
--
you
know.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
that’s
so,
but
i
think
the
point
of
all
this
is,
is
that
if
congress
wants
to
legislate
specifically
with
respect
to
professional
football
leagues,
whether
or
not
they
administer
a
pension
fund,
that
really
doesn’t
help
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
because
i
think
that
this
case
turns
on
the
validity
of
the
provision
in
the
regulation
that
the
activities
of
a
c6
organization
should
be
directed
to
the
improvement
of
business
conditions
of
one
or
more
lines
of
business
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case
and
i
think
quiet
properly
that
this
organization
was
not
directed
to
the
improvement
of
business
conditions
of
one
or
more
lines
of
business.
it
was
simply
directed
to
the
improvement
of
the
conditions
of
midas
franchisees.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
cases
that
we
discuss
in
our
brief
cite
some
examples.
the
produce
stock
clearing
association
upon
which
court
of
appeals
cited
the
earlier
second
circuit
decision,
that
was
in
the
organization
of
stockyard
owners,
stock
dealers
which
provided
for
clearing
services
for
its
members.
the
evanston
north
shore
real
estate
association,
which
is
the
court
of
claims
case,
which
operated
a
multiple
listing
service
for
its
members.
there
is
another
old
sixth
circuit
case
called
automotive
electric
association,
which
the
principle
activity
of
which
was
to
publish
a
catalog,
advertising
the
products
of
its
members.
these
kinds
of
things
are
regarded
as
--
you
know
are
regarded
as
performance
of
particular
services.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
would
have
to
answer
that
question
in
two
parts.
i
think
principally
its
activities
are
not
directed
to
the
improvement
of
business
conditions
of
one
or
more
lines
of
business
and
you
know
its
flunks
that
part
of
the
regulation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
one
can
read
the
regulation
the
way
you
suggested
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
but
the
courts
have
uniformly
read
at
the
other
way
as
an
existence
of
two
different
texts.
in
other
words,
that
you
have
got
to
be
engaged
in
activities,
which
improve
business
conditions
along,
of
one
or
more
lines
of
business
and
you
also
can't
perform
particular
services
for
individual
persons.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that,
what
those
courts
have
said
is
essentially
the
–
well
i
think
the
courts
have
read
that
sentence
to
provide
for
a
positive
requirement
and
also
incorporating
a
negative
requirement.
now
i
suppose
the
best
way
to
construe,
i
mean
the
way
we
construe
the
regulations
is
as
follows.
on
the
one
hand
you've
got,
you
must
meet
the
line
of
business
requirement
of
the
regulations,
that’s
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
that’s
what
this
tax
payer
unquestionably
does
not
meet.
and
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
by
setting
forth
another
poll
--
a
negative
polar
example
is
to
assure
that
–
is
to
provide
a
kind
of
bright
line
rule
and
--
on
the
theory
that
most
organizations
that
provide
services
for
particular
service
for
individual
persons
would
be
the
kinds
of
organizations
that
will
not,
activities
will
not
be
directed
across
one
or
more
lines
of
business
and
let
me
give
you
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
supposed
that’s
right.
now
in
this
particular
case
i
think
you
can
really
see
how
the
two
parts
of
the
sentence
of
the
regulation
more
or
less
come
together
in
the
–
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
here
you
have
an
association
of
midas,
muffler
dealers.
they
exclude
everybody
else.
midas
by
undisputed
stipulated
fact
constitutes
about
21%
of
the
market.
the
whole
thrust
of
this
organization's
activities
is
to
boost
the
competitive
position
of
midas,
vis-à-vis
the
rest
of
the
muffler
industry.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
on
paper,
yes,
in
the
sense
that
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
was
the
corporation,
the
tax
payers
original
bylaws
provided
that
you
had
to
be
a
midas
franchisee
to
be
a
member,
they
then
dropped
that
more
or
less
as
a
cosmetic.
i
think,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
in
order
to
--
as
part
of
their
campaign
to
get
the
exemption,
but
it's
undisputed
here
that
you
had
to
be
a
midas
member,
midas
franchisee
to
continue
to
be
a
member
under
both
the
old
and
the
new
version
of
the
regulate
--
of
the
bylaws
and
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
was
they
would
be
dropped
as
a
member.
in
fact
all
the
correspondence
talks
about
dear
fellow
midas
dealer.
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
question
that
if
you
left
the
midas
family
you
would
be
dropped
from
membership.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
it’s
possible
i
suppose
one
could
continue
to
be
a
member
in
order
to
receive
the
benefit
of
what
the
competition
was
making.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
unless
you
felt
there
was
some
need
to
get
some
intelligence
from
the
midas
operation,
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
i
don’t
--
yeah.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
i
think
that
the
--
the
part
of
the
facts
that
i
was
referring
to
are
set
forth
in
our
briefed
at
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
muffler,
i
think
you
know
it
does
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly.
in
other
words,
what
judge
kylie
said
in
dissent
in
the
seventh
circuit
is
that
bottling
pepsi
cola
is
not
a
line
of
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
bottling
soda
is
a
line
of
business,
but
getting
back
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
the
principle
point
--
the
principle
fact
is
that
this
association
paid
50%
of
the
course
of
a
market
study
in
order
to
maintain
and
strengthen
the
position
of
midas
in
the
muffler
replacement
business.
and
it
also
established
committees
to
“help
make
the
midas
program
an
ongoing
source
of
profit
for
everyone.”
those
two
things
are
set
forth
at
pages
31
of
our
brief.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
it
was
also,
one
other
thing
was
that
it
setup
a
kind
of
monitoring
of
pipe
prices
in
order
to
assure
that
it
receives
the
lowest
price
for
pipes
prices
from
midas
international
in
order
to
make
sure
that
it
could,
i
suppose
do
its
work
at
prices
lower
than
the
competition.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
have
a
100%
requirement,
but
i
think
this
case
is
in
our
view
a
blatant
case
because
it
essentially
excludes
by
undisputed
estimation
79%
of
the
industry.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
think
it
probably
would
be,
because,
and
i
think
the
answer
simply
is
that
it's
difficult
for
the
service
to
administer
a
statute
where
you
know
you
would
say
well
this
organization
although
it's
not
broad
base,
really
provides
direct
and
indirect
benefits
to
the
industry
as
a
whole,
while
this
one
which
is
not
broad
based
is
pretty
narrow.
i
think
in
order
sort
of
reduce
the
energies
needed
to
monitor
these
organizations,
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
their
broad
based
is
to
limit
the
exemption
to
those
organizations
which
open
their
doors
to
people
in
the
industry
generally.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
not
have
to
rely
on
kind
of
the
indirect
benefit.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
you
had
a
ford
dealers'
exemption,
yes
it
would
be
and
the
service
has
so
ruled.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
you
have
to
be
automobile
dealers,
simply
because
--
in
fact,
there
are
all
sorts
cases
involving
ford
dealers
that
can
federate
for
purposes
of
joint
advertising
and
things
like
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
may
well
have
different
common
problems
and
there
maybe
an
advantage
for
them
to
get
together
and
to
discuss
them,
but
the
c6
exemption
is
limited
to
those
whose
activities
are
directed
across
at
least
a
line
of
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
mean,
of
course,
there
are
gradations
of
categorization
and
one
could
say
i
suppose
there
ought
to
be,
you
know
if
you
carry
that
to
an
extreme
–
there
ought
to
be
single
trade
association
for
business
generally,
but
the
service
has
wisely
refrained
from
taking
that
position.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
was
no
conflict.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
don’t
like
to
trouble,
in
fact
quite
frankly
mr.
justice
franklin
the
acquiescence
of
this
case
was
a
big
deal
of
concern
to
us
only
because
an
appropriate
question
to
mr.
gordan
earlier,
there
was
very
little
money
involved
in
this
case.
if
you
look
at
page
11a
of
the
appendix,
the
tax
payers'
complaint
indicates
that
$5,500
of
tax
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
doubt
it
very
much,
but
the
point
is
we
do
think
that
the
second
circuit’s
decision
is
correct
and
that
the
seventh
circuit’s
decision
is
incorrect.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
in
1968
and
the
industry
is
on,
in
fact,
in
our
acquiescence
we
pointed
out
that
there
were
about
13
pending
applications
presenting
this
issue.
so
we
thought
it
would,
everyone
would
benefit
from
the
uniform
rule
and
we
think
the
uniform
rule
has
been
the
rule
that
has
been
extended
since
1929
and
that
is
that
the
line
of
business
requirement
as
judge
kaufman
said
is
well
suited
to
the
legislative
intent
of
limiting
the
exemption
to
those
organizations
that
provide
a
--
you
know
that
provide
benefits
to
a
broad
spectrum
of
the
business
community
and
not
simply
midas
muffler
dealers
or
sacramento
tomato
juice
canners
or
whatever
but
tomato
juice
canners
and
you
know
you
don’t
have
to
take
the
position
that
it
has
to
be
all
food
or
all
juices
or
all
beverages
and
that
you
know
don’t
have
to
include
the
distillers
if
you
want
have
an
organization
limited
to
tomato
juice
process.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
is
a
ruling
that
is
discussed
in
both
briefs
that
says
that
but
it's
not,
but
it’s
the
segment,
but
if
it’s
a
broad
base
of
an
industry
would
for
example
the
power
tool
manufacturers
or
whatever
rather
than
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
would
be
all
right
assuming
that
the
organization
opens
its
doors
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
i
think
that
really,
if
you
permit
me
blinks
in
reality
because
while
they
change
their
bylaws
they
never
made
any
attempt
to
solicit
non-midas
dealers
and
i
think
mr.
gordon
would
agree
that
they
had
no
intention
of
doing
that.
the
whole
thrust
of
the
organization
is
to
limit
its
members
to
midas
franchises
and
i
think
that
the
case
has
to
be
considered
on
that
basis.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
maybe
in
ten
years
we
could
see
the
results
of
all
of
those
and
the
court
continues
to
hold
the
case
i
suppose.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
they
are
significantly
different
because
as
judge
kaufman
said
in
short
the
bulk
of
the
industries
is
excluded.
i
don’t
see
how
you
can
say
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
i
think
the
difference
is
simply
is
that
this
organization
is
pretty
much
of,
you
know
in
a
way
of
an
adjunct
of
midas
in
the
sense
that
it's
designed
to
boost
the
competitive
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
that’s,
but
that’s
also,
but
you
know
i
mean,
that’s
true,
that’s
part
of
its
activities
as
well.
but
simply
because
it’s
bargaining
with
midas,
you
know
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
i
think
the
bargaining
aspect
of
it
is
not
necessarily
controlling
because
i
think
as
the
second
circuit
said
in
the
footnote
towards
the
end
of
its
opinion,
in
pressing
this
argument
the
association
knows
the
similarities
between
itself
and
labor
unions
which
are
granted
an
exemption
under
501
(c)(5).
it
has
however
made
no
claim
that
it
has
qualified
for
an
exemption
as
a
labor
organization.
we
accordingly
express
no
opinion
with
respect
to
the
relevance
of
that
section
under
the
code.
i
mean
here
we
--
you
know
those
rulings
which
talk
about
bargaining
and
provided
for
a
business
league
status
provided
--
you
know
had
a
broad
based
membership
and
i
think
that
if
people
don’t
--
i
think
there
is
a
quite
a
difference
between
closing
the
doors
to
non-midas
people
and
opening
the
doors
and
having
no
one
choose
to
come
in.
i
think
that’s
a
quite
big
difference
and
i
don’t
think
that,
this
case
would
be
looked
that
on
the
basis
of
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
policy
in
this
area
is
always
difficult.
you
know
one
can
make
a
case
that
lots
of
things
are
--
lots
of
organization
engaged
in
commendable
activities
you
know
that
benefits
society,
general
motors
does
as
well,
though
it’s
not
tax
exempt.
here
i
think
the
evidence
is
clear
that
congress
wanted
to
benefit
chambers
of
commerce,
boards
of
trade
and
that
business
league
were
supposed
to
be
analogous
to
those
kinds
of
things
there.
now
the
accepted
definitions
of
chambers
of
commerce
and
boards
of
trade
are
broad
based
organizations,
whether
they,
you
know
like
u.s.
chamber
of
commerce
which
includes
the
fortune
500
and
a
lots
of
originations
like
that,
whether
it’s
a
board
of
trade
that
maybe
the
milwaukee
board
of
trade
that
includes
all
sorts
of
business
both
large
and
small.
here
we
have
you
know
the
polar
example.
midas
franchisees,
it’s
hard
to
imagine
anything,
any
class,
narrower
than
that
and
congress
is
--
and
you
know
that’s
just
not
like
a
board
of
trade
or
a
chamber
of
commerce.
congress
has
made
that
decision.
it’s
opened
up
the
exemption
to
professional
football
leagues.
every
time
congress
wants
to
--
every
time
there
is
a
pressure
for
one
sort
or
another,
congress
either
speaks
or
it
doesn’t
speak
and
it
seems
to
us
that
to
start
legislating
in
this
area
and
abrogating
rules
that
have
been
in
extent
for
50
years
is
quite
hazardous.
congress
says
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
congress
could
speak
i
mean
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
the
question.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
congress,
sir,
yes
that
it
true.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it’s
hard
to
imagine
that.
in
our
view
though
we
take
the
contra
position.
congress,
you
know
the
accepted
definition
of
business
league
is
not
as
the
petitioner
sees
it
and
i
suppose
congress
could
speak
why
the
internal
revenue
code
can
be
quite
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
it
wouldn’t
have
to
go,
it
wouldn’t
have
to
go
into
such
crass
detail.
it
would
have
to
say
a
business
league
shall
not
be
denied
exemption
solely
on
the
grounds
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
that
it’s
limited
to
the
franchisees
of
a
single
branded
product
or
something
that.
the
internal
revenue
code,
i
think
the
court
well
realizes
can
be
quite
detailed
when
it
wants
to
be.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it’s
been
quite
general,
but
yet
since,
for
the
last
50
years
the
regulations
have
filled
that
gap
and
we
think
quite
properly
so.
i
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
if
the
regulation
filled
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
did
–
the
regulations
did
and
my
understanding
is
that
the
activities
of
a
baseball
league
are
directed
to
the
improvement
of
business
conditions
across
a
line
of
business
of
baseball
activity.
although
one
i
suppose
could
argue
to
the
contract.
my
understanding
is
simply
as
an
administrative
matter
as
of
the
moment
baseball
leagues
and
similar
sports
leagues
that
cover
a
broad
spectrum
of
major
sports
activity
are
enjoying
the
exemption.
now
whether
that
will
continue
i
don’t
know.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
does,
it
does.
well
that
--
all
i
want
to
say
in
closing
i
suppose
is
that
when
congress
speaks,
it
speaks
with
precession.
i
don’t
think
that
you
could
–
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
but
i
mean
with
respect
to
things
like
professional
football
leagues,
it’s
hard
to
imagine
anything
more
detail
than
that.
i
don’t
think
one
can
analogize
football
to
baseball
given
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
if
i
said
that
i
didn’t
mean
to
say
that.
i
think
that
the
football
exemption
came
in,
the
only
reason
it
came
in
was
to
–
is
more
or
less
to
ratify
the
activities
of
the
professional
football
league
in
administering
a
pension
plan.
i
don’t
--
i'm
not
sure
--
i
think
that
the
better
argument
would
be
that
you
can’t
analogize
the
case
for
baseball
from
the
football
language
of
the
code.
i
wouldn’t
want
to
take
that
argument
if
i
had
to,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
a
detailed
provision.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
shape
of
the
ball
is
different,
that
is
true.
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no
i
didn’t
think
–
no
mr.
justice
stewart
i
don’t
think
does
deprive
us
of
that,
because
i
think
that
you
know,
i
think
that
just
has
to
put
aside.
i
think
could
congress
could
have
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no
i'm
saying,
i
think
that
professional
football
is
so
different
than
everything
else
that
precedes,
that
our
argument
noscitur
a
sociis
still
applies
to
the
first
three
phases
of
that
paragraph.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
of
course
and
if
they
have
done
that
i
suppose
we
wouldn’t
be
here,
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
is
–
you
know
it
is
not
one
of
the
humdingers
of
the
court’s
term,
but
nevertheless
i
think
that
you
know
we
do
have
here
a
situation
where
income
does
expenditures
and
the
case
has
to
be
decided
accordingly.
