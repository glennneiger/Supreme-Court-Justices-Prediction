mr.
gordon
you
may
proceed,
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
mr.
gordon
that,
that
would
be
little
bit
like
the
union
being
organized
when
a
non-union
plant
changes
hands
with
the
new
owner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case
if
they
had
$1
million
or
$2
million
instead
of
whatever
it
is
that
they
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case,
in
this
posture?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
will
be
in
some
future
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
anyone
shed
any
light
on
why
basketball
leagues
and
baseball
leagues
are
not
in
the
act
except
that
perhaps
they
didn’t
lobby
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
certainly
a
broad
disclaimer
whether
or
not
they
operate
a
pension
plan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
couldn’t
we
talk
on
this
record
mr.
smith,
what
would
happened
if
one
of
these
dealers
decided
to
leave
the
midas
franchise
and
take
of
one
of
their
competing
franchises,
could
he
still
remain
a
member
of
this
organization?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
tell
us
that
under
the
football
language
they’ve
included
baseball
if
i
understood
you
correctly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.

chief
justice

you
gentlemen.

case
is
submitted.
