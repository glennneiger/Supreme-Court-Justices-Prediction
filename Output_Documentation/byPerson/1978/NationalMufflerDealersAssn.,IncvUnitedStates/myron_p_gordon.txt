mr.
myron
p.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
may
please
the
court.
the
question
for
decision
here
is
whether
or
not
an
association
of
franchisees
of
a
specific
franchisor
loses
the
exemption
under
section
501
(c)
(6)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
as
a
business
league,
even
though
it
might
and
does
otherwise
qualify
solely
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
does
consists
of
all
franchisees
of
a
particular
franchisor
in
this
case,
midas
muffler
franchisees.
i
should
like
to
begin
the
argument
by
describing
very
briefly
this
association,
petitioner
in
this
case
and
i
think
its
best
described
in
the
words
of
chief
judge
kaufman
of
the
second
circuit,
who
pointed
out
that
it
was
organized
at
a
time
when
an
internal
struggle
was
taking
place
within
the
parent
company.
the
franchisor
and
many
of
midas'
franchisees
were
concerned
that
they
might
suffer
from
pending
corporate
shake
up.
as
a
consequence
of
this
they
formed
the
association
to
secure
themselves
against
the
whims
of
a
new
midas
management.
judge
kaufman
goes
on
to
say
in
the
later
portion
of
his
opinion.
in
it’s
endeavors
the
associations
are
generally
to
readdress
the
inequality
of
bargaining
power
existing
between
--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
exactly,
its
similar
to
that
and
we
make
the
argument
in
our
papers,
that
there
is
a
great
similarity
between
a
union
and
in
this
case
while
not
a
union,
nevertheless
a
group
of
business
man,
if
you
well
getting
together
to
bargain
collectively
with
their
franchisor.
and
that
there
are
many
similarities
between
the
union
analogy
and
the
franchisee
association
analogy.
in
any
event,
judge
kaufman
goes
on
to
say
that
the
association
has
been
formidable
force
at
the
negotiating
table,
which
follows
through
exactly
as
to
the
analogy
between
the
union
and
an
employer.
so
that
the
genesis
of
this
trade
association
or
business
league
was
protective
and
defensive.
it's
not
a
profit
making
organization.
it
was
never
intended
to
be
that
and
again
merely
formed
readdress
any
inequality
of
bargaining
power
between
an
individual
franchisee
and
a
monolithic
strong,
financially
franchisor.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
well,
there
could
be,
there
some
money
involved
here
and
they
could
be
significant
amounts
of
money
involved
only
because
it's
very
frequently
the
case
that
a
franchisee
organization
builds
up
a
reserve
to
have
as
a
kind
of
war
chest,
if
you
will,
and
during
those
times,
that
it
builds
up
the
reserve
when
its
incomes
exceeds
the
amounts
of
its
outgo
for
any
particular
period
of
time
for
one
year,
two
years,
three
years
or
at
any
time
when
it
shows
an
excess
of
income
over
expenditures
there
is
that
much
involved.
we
are
dealing
here
with
several
years.
it
may
involve
a
substantial
sum
of
money.
i
have
not
figured
it
out.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
well,
we
don’t
have
a
$1
million
war
chest
in
this
case
and
actually--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
we
could,
but
on
the
other
hand
i
would
say
your
honor,
that
if
any
association,
any
business
league
or
trade
association
ever
built
up
an
unnecessary
accumulation
of
surplus,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
plenty
of
tools.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
that’s
correct
and
non-
profit
means
essentially
that
and
is
defined
in
the
statute
that
no
part
of
the
income
is
goes
to
any
individual
association
member,
so
that
the
amount
of
money
i
don’t
think
is
an
issue
here.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
this
is
solely
--
this
association
is
solely
financed
by
dues
from
its
members,
that’s
correct.
and
those
dues
may
be
raised
from
time-to-time,
may
be
lowered
as
the
case
may
be
in
order
to
deal
with
specific
situations.
now,
the
statute
--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
it
might.
it
might
then
be
said
--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
not
in
this
case.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
that’s
correct,
and
some
future
case,
if
it
is
determined
that
there
was
on
reasonable
accumulation
that
perhaps
it
had
lost
its
so
called
non-profit
status
because
of
the
way
it
operated
as
i
say,
i’m
sure
the
internal
revenue
service
has
adequate
means
with
which
to
check
on
that
and
change
the
ruling
or
look
at
it.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
yes,
they
do
--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
that’s
right.
they
file
annual
returns.
it's
subject
to
order
by
internal
revenue
service
the
same
as
any
other
organization
and
if
it's
found
as
indicated
that
they
are
no
longer
non-profit
and
they
are
adequate
means
at
the
internal
revenue
service
to
correct
them.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
we
have
been
filing
returns
your
honor.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
we
have
filed
returns
as
a
non
exempt
from
taxation
claiming
that
there
is
--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
no,
we’re
filing
--
claiming
that
we,
since
we
have
denied
the
exemption
would
be
filing
regular
returns
under
protest
and
we
have
filed
refunds
in
each
case
and
that’s
how
we
get
here
because
--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
yes,
sir.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
certainly.
we
are
required
to
under
the
statute.
we
file
special
forms
of
returns.
i
don’t
know
the
form
number
as
a
non-profit
organization.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
that’s
correct.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
no,
no
as
one
under
501(c)(6),
we
are
required
to
file
annual
income
tax
returns.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
no
sir
there
is
not.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
that
is
correct
and
this
category
is,
if
i
may
go
to
the
statute
now
the
business
league,
the
statute
which
was
passed
in
1913
and
i
should
say
in
passing
that
it's
long
before
franchising
was
known
to
the
economy
of
the
united
states
granted
an
exemption
from
income
tax,
the
business
leagues,
chambers
of
commerce
and
boards
of
trade.
the
were
two
amendments
subsequently.
in
1928
real
estate
boards
were
added
to
the
list
of
exemptions
and
in
1966
football
leagues
were
added
to
the
list
of
exemptions
and
in
no
place
in
statute
is
there
any
further
definition
of
business
league.
the
only
thing
that
we
do
have
is
a
statement
that
it
is
nor
organized
for
profit
and
no
part
of
the
net
earnings
of
which
can
be
used
to
benefit
of
any
private
shareholder
or
individual
and
that’s
entire
statue.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
i
don’t
know
why
football
leagues,
i
confess
have
been
preferred
of
a
baseball
leagues,
i
do
not
know.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that
but
in
any
event
the
only
reason
now
that
we’ve
been
denied
the
exemption
is
the
claim
that
a
business
league
must
be
similar
to
a
chamber
of
commerce
or
a
board
of
trade.
we
contend
that
that
position
is
not
warranted
by
either
the
legislative
history,
the
judicial
history
or
in
fact
by
the
way
the
internal
revenues
service
has
itself
treated
business
leagues
and
other
trade
associations.
actually
in
the
regulation,
which
has
been
in
effect
for
many,
many
years,
the
first
sentence
with
some
modifications
has
been
in
effect
for
many,
many
years,
says
that
business
league
is
an
association
of
persons
having
some
common
business
interest,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
promote
such
common
interest
and
not
to
engage
in
regular
business
of
a
kind
ordinarily
carried
on
for
profit.
we
submit
that
that
sentence
properly
states
the
intent
of
congress
and
does
define
what
a
business
league
is?
now
peculiarly
enough
in
1929,
there
was
something
added
to
the
regulation.
in
1929
for
the
first
time
we
find
the
second
and
third
sentences
indicating
that
the
business
league
is
supposed
to
be
an
organization
of
the
same
general
classes
of
chamber
of
commerce
or
board
of
trade
and
thus
its
activity
should
be
the
directed
the
improvement
of
business
conditions
of
one
or
more
lines
of
business.
however,
before
1929
that
was
not
the
rule
and
we
have
handed
up
to
your
honors
something
that
i
apologize
for
having
found
late,
but
nevertheless
is
of
great
importance
i
think
and
that
is
that
before
the
1929
amendment,
there
was
a
specific
sentence
the
second
sentence
of
the
regulation
its
work
meaning
business
league's
work
need
not
be
similar
to
that
of
a
chamber
of
commerce
or
board
of
trade.
now
what
happened
between
1913
and
1929
to
justify
that
complete
180
degree
turn
about
and
the
internal
revenue
services
position
i
don’t
know.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
it
was
adopted
into
the
1926
statute.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
was
a
continuation
of
what
had
gone
before.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
well,
the
regulations
are.
every
time
what
they
did
was
when
they
revised
the
internal
revenue
called
during
various
periods
of
time,
they
readopted
this
statute
and
the
regulation
was
changed
each
time.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
no,
i
suggest
that
i
know
what
was
in
effect
since
1926
and
it
may
have
been
in
effect,
perhaps
mr.
smith
knows
more
about
that
than
i
do
at
the
moment,
to
best
of
my
knowledge
that
was
the
rule
all
the
way
back
to
the
adoption
of
the
statute.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
and
if
i
may
submit
the
other
regulations,
i
have
to
conclude
the
argument,
i
would
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
do
so,
so
that
your
honors
have
the
full
picture.
as
i
say
i
must
apologize
it
and
realize
until
the
last
minute
that
there
had
been
that
change
and
that’s
why
only
handed
up
where
i
found
at
the
very
last
minute
on
wednesday.
we
look
and
see,
what
was
reason
for
the
change
and
the
only
the
reason
that
we
have
been
able
to
determine
for
the
--
only
reason
for
the
change
in
1929
was
the
statement,
which
appears
in
the
government's
brief
that
it
came
about
as
a
result
of
a
case
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
in
1928.
there
is
no
other
legislative
history
that
we
can
find
on
that
and
the
fact
is
that
if
that
were
the
case,
there
is
nothing
in
that
case,
which
in
anyway
justifies
the
change
and
this
180
degree
turn
in
the
regulation.
before
i
get
to
that
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
statute,
i
don’t
think
needs
the
application
of
latin
maxims
such
as
noscitur
a
sociis
is
when
used
several
times
in
the
past.
in
order
to
determine
exactly
what
a
business
league
means.
in
other
words,
if
the
statute
had
said
that
there
are
should
be
an
exemption
for
a
chamber
of
commerce
or
a
board
of
trade
or
other
business
league
then
it
might
very
well
be
said
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
that
other
business
league
might
have
in
same
general
characteristics
as
a
chamber
of
commerce
or
a
board
of
trade,
but
we
don’t
find
that.
we
find
these
under
disjunctive
business
leagues
separately,
chamber
of
commerce
separately
and
board
of
trade
separately.
so
that
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
see
in
the
statute
itself,
which
warrants
any
constriction
that
says,
that
the
business
league
must
be
similar
and
have
similar
characteristics
to
a
chamber
of
commerce
to
board
of
trade
and
as
i
pointed
out
before
in
fact
the
internal
revenue
service
took
the
opposite
position
up
until
1929.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
there
certainly
are,
sir.
i
have
tried
to
determine
the
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
football
leagues
in
1966
amendment
and
i
have
been
told
on
one
hand
as
an
congressional
aberration,
which
may
very
well
be
and
on
the
other
hand
that
nobody
really
knows
the
reasons,
they
were
always
exempt,
but
there
was
just
put
into
make
sure
that
they
exemption
was
granted
to
them,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out
that
if
we
are
going
into
these
characteristics
and
have
the
same
general
characteristics
and
even
if
we
assume
that
a
real-estate
board,
which
was
added
in
1928
has
the
same
general
characteristics
then
your
honor
is
quite
right.
i
see,
no
justification
for
categorizing
a
football
league
and
putting
him
in
same
categories
at
chamber
of
commerce
or
board
of
trade
and
its
strikes
us
that
this
evidences
an
intention
of
congress
not
to
make
them
similar
and
never
was
intended
to
be
similar.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
no,
it
may
very
well
be
that.
i’ve
always
been
told
and
that
football
leagues
were
always
considered
exempt,
but
there
was
some
question
because
football
leagues
were
operating
pension
plans
and
they
put
that
phrase
in
which
may
or
may
not
operate
a
pension
plan
is
a
way
to
keep
them,
make
sure
that
they
got
their
exemption.
but
i
merely
point
out
that
the
football
league,
whether
or
not
it
operates
a
pension
plan
as
has
been
pointed
out
is
hardly
in
the
same
categories
of
chamber
of
commerce
or
board
of
trade.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
that
may
be
sir,
that
may
be
--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
but
we
looked
at
the,
see
if
there
is
any
legislative
history
that
would
shed
any
light
and
the
government
says
the
only
legislative
history
it
has
found
is
some
representations
to
congress
back
when
the
exemption
was
originally
adopted
by
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce
glorifying
the
effect
of
non-profit
associations
of
a
businessman.
i
would
think
that
that's
hardly
a
substitute
for
some
language
by
any
of
legislators
or
some
language
in
any
committee
report,
which
indicated
that
was
the
intent
of
congress
and
i
think
its
reaching
pretty
far
to
take
self-serving
declarations
of
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce
and
say
that
the
constitutes
a
manner
of
precedent
for
determining
that
that
was
the
intent
of
congress.
the
congressional
intent
may
be
determined
by
people
who
plead
before
congress
for
a
specific
exemption.
now
there
was
no
question
about
the
fact
that
if
we
are
correct
and
that
the
business
league
is
properly
defined
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
regulation
that
the
appellant
in
this
case
meets
every
phase
of
that
intent.
it
fits
the
first
sentence
of
the
regulation.
it
strikes
us
therefore
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
regulation
as
it
existed
prior
to
1929,
the
first
sentence
of
the
regulation,
the
lack
of
any
other
judicial
precedent
accept
of
course
any
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit,
which
was
contrary
to
that
of
the
second
circuit
and
that’s
why
we
here
i
guess,
that
by
definition
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
exemption
as
a
matter
again
of
simple
statutory
construction.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
i
could,
i
could
take
that
–
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
i
would
because
i
think
that
regulation
was
indented
to
do
something
less
than
is
now
and
claimed
for
it.
i
think
if
the
regulation
were
read
carefully,
you
would
find
that
what
it
attempts
to
do
is
make
a
distinction
between
improvement
of
business
conditions
because
in
that
sentence
it
says
as
distinguished
from
the
performance
of
particular
services
for
individual
persons,
so
that
in
effect
we
concede
that
any
group,
business
league
or
otherwise
that
is
formed
for
the
purpose
of
performing
services,
particular
services
for
its
members,
which
the
members
put
themselves
do
expect
that
possibly
like
a
cooperative
buying
organization,
they
can
do
it
more
cheaply,
they
not
entitled
to
the
exemption,
that
was
not
the
intend
of
congress
under
these
circumstances.
but
as
distinguish
from
that
any
other
group
of
businessmen
that
have
a
common
business
interest
and
form
together
to
promote
that
common
business
interest
are,
we
submit,
entitled
to
the
exemption
and
that
was
definitely
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
only
since
1929,
your
honors.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
but
the
first
sixty
years
which
i
think
might
be
a
lot
closer
to
the
original
--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
i
would
say
that
under
circumstances
we
would
have
the
different
case
but
we
do
--
this
is
not
the
same
case
here.
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
it
would
strike
me
that
if
in
fact
the
commissioner
did
change
his
mind
there
should
been
logical
reason
for
the
change
of
mind
and
they
should
have
been
something
in
either
the
judicial
precedents
or
in
the
review
of
the
congressional
intent,
which
would
indicate
that’s
what
should
have
been
done.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
but
on
the
other
hand
that,
yes
its
true,
it
reflects
his
view
of
the
statue,
but
unless
that
view
is
reasonable.
i
submit
that
it
is
not
entitled
to
the
force
of
the
law
even
though
it
may
been
encrusted
on
books
of
the
internal
revenue
service
for
almost
fifty
years,
if
in
fact
that
is
not
reasonable.
and
to
answer
your
honor’s
question
still
further
the
fact
is
that
during
these
year
since
1929
there
was
no
direct
case
similar
to
this
until
we
come
to
the
pepsi-cola
case
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
in
that
case
as
your
honor
knows
they
held
that
the
an
association
of
franchisees
was
a
business
league
entitled
to
the
exemption
and
that
was
the
only
appellate
case
directly
on
point
until
the
national
muffler
case
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
he
did
not
acquiesce,
that
is
correct.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
it
may
very
well
being
that
he
was
applying
the
law
that
way
but
as
i
say
i
do
not
know
of
any
specific
cases.
you
see
we
tend
to
confuse
in
the
history
of
these
case
in
the
long
history
of
these
cases,
statements
of
general
so
called
general
principle,
which
are
really
not
applicable
because
in
the
second
circuit
case
which
originally
determined
this
case,
which
originally
used
that
term
noscitur
a
sociis
and
which
coded
from
the
regulation,
the
fact
is
that
was
an
issue.
there
the
was
group
of
people,
a
group
of
businessmen
who
got
together
to
do
something
for
themselves
that
they
could
have
done
for
themselves
and
that
case
could
very
well
been
decided
on
the
simple
ground
that
they
were
clearly
not
exempt
and
there
was
no
necessity
to
go
into
all
of
these
questions.
now
the
--
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
conclude
my
argument
if
your
honors
please
by
pointing
out
that
there
is
no
logical
basis
for
the
distinction
made
in
this
case.
we
pointed
out
before
the
franchisees
of
a
single
franchisor
have
a
common
business
interest
is
defined
in
the
regulation;
protection
against
the
powerful
franchisor.
we
have
pointed
out
that
common
business
interest
is
more
compelling
then
may
obtain
for
other
groups
of
businessmen.
we’ve
pointed
out
in
our
petition
for
writ
in
this
case,
the
burgeoning
position
of
franchising
in
this
country
in
the
millions,
million
and
millions
of
dollars
that
are
being
spent
by
the
public
with
franchise
organizations
and
the
necessity,
if
you
will,
for
franchisees
to
band
together
to
do
the
very
thing
that
petitioner
in
this
case
did.
we’ve
pointed
out
that
there
was
one
case
only
recently
in
one
of
the
district
courts
in
which
a
judge
pointed
to
the
great
need
for
one
of
the
traditional
control
mechanisms
where
a
franchisor
has
been
to
keep
its
franchisees
disorganized.
franchisees
find
necessity
must
have
access
to
the
franchise
group
in
order
to
act
together,
to
deal
with
common
problems,
whether
those
problems
be
the
impreciseness
of
franchisor
or
some
less
moment
is
concerned.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
i
don’t
think
so
sir.
i
at
least
to
not
come
across
with
it
in
that
context.
so
we
ask
finally
i
think
by
what
logic
can
it
be
argued
that
a
group
of
businessmen,
who
join
together
to
bargain
with
the
union
are
exempt
and
they
are,
there
is
no
question
about
it,
not
only
as
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
union
work
is
getting
together
to
bargain
with
their
employer
exempt,
but
groups
of
businessmen
may
get
together
to
bargain
with
a
union
of
their
employees
and
they
are
exempt,
by
what
logic
can
a
distinction
be
made
between
that
group
and
a
group
who
joined
together
to
bargain
with
a
franchisor.
we
see
no
way
that
these
can
possibly
be
distinguished
logically.
we
believe
that
seventh
circuit
was
right
in
its
holding
and
we
submit
that
the
case
of
reversed
here.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
myron
p.
gordon
no,
i
would
only
add
one
thing
if
your
honors
please
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
for
the
argument
made
by
mr.
smith
that
this
organization
was
formed
to
enhance
the
midas
program
in
any
way.
mr.
justice
stevens
is
quite
right.
the
organization
was
formed
as
a
protective,
and
a
defensive
measure
only
and
there
is
no
other
justification
for
its
existence.
that
it
may
from
time
to
time
help
and
work
together
with
midas
is
something
that
a
union
does
from
time
to
time,
with
an
employer
working
together
to
enhance
the
position
of
both.
but
in
the
ultimate
and
the
general
position
is
entirely
that
it
has
been
formed
an
act
as
a
defensive
measure
and
as
i
point
merely
for
bargaining,
collective
bargaining,
if
you
will,
with
the
franchisor.
thank
you.
