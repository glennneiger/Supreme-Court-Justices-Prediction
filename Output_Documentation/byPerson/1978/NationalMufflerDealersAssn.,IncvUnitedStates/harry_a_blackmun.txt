mr.
gordon,
i
suppose
it's
irrelevant,
but
we
have
very
much
money
involved
here,
tax
violations
and
all.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose,
i
should
ask
government
counsel
that
question
here
because
they
have
other
cases
presumably,
but
it
didn't
seem
to
me
as
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
certainly
is
reason
to
track
down
regulations
were
still
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
certainly
there
are
distinctions
between
a
professional
football
league
and
a
chamber
of
commerce?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith
you
will
comment
on
the
form
of
the
regulation
prior
to
the
1929?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
before
you
do
mr.
smith,
certainly
your
footnote
four
is
a
blind
footnote
with
respect
to
the
pre
1928
regulations.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
nearly
recite
the
earlier
regulations
are
and
just
giving
their
title,
but
without
pointing
out
the
seemingly
opposing
analysis
on
those
prior
regulations?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
will
discuss
in
detail
in
your
brief,
i
take
it
not.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
this.
the
commissioner
frequently
has
done
this
and
i
would
have
hoped
that
your
brief
would
point
out
the
decision
in
the
way
collateral
cases
anyway
that
lead
to
the
change
as
you
do
to
degree
on
pages
on
20
and
21.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
certainly
was
hung
with
your
footnote
4,
[attempt
to
laughter]
it's
brought
to
your
embarrassing
attention
i
would
say.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
even
more
on
third
question.
[attempt
to
laughter]
you
weren’t
around
in
1966.
do
you
know
why
the
government
didn’t
seek
cert
in
pepsi
cola?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
you
said
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
it
had
gone
the
other
way
would
you
will
here
petitioning
for
cert?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
is
a
tax
case
coming
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
just
last
week,
the
washington
post
said
that
we
took
rarely
any
tax
cases,
this
is
one,
and
we've
had
several
this
term.
the
issue
is
whether
a
trade
organization
for
muffler
dealers
that
confines
its
membership
to
dealers
franchised
by
midas
international
corporation
and
its
activities
to
the
business
of
midas'
mufflers
is
entitled
to
exemption
from
federal
income
tax
as
a
business
league
under
section
501
(c)
(6)
of
the
1954
internal
revenue
code.
the
pertinent
treasury
regulation
state
that
a
business
league
is
an
organization
of
the
same
general
class
as
the
chamber
of
commerce
or
a
board
of
trade
and
to
be
exempt
should
have
its
activities
directed
to
the
improvement
of
business
conditions
of
one
or
more
lines
of
business.
the
district
court
held
that
the
midas
muffler
franchisees
do
not
constitute
a
line
of
business
and
accordingly
that
petitioner
was
not
a
business
league
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
thus
was
not
entitled
to
exemption.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
expressly
disagreeing
with
a
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
a
few
years
ago
concerning
pepsi-cola
bottlers'
association,
a
similar
trade
organization
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
between
the
circuits.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
in
turn
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
the
claimed
that
tax
exemption
as
a
business
league
within
the
meaning
of
section
501
(c)
(6).
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
justice
stevens.
