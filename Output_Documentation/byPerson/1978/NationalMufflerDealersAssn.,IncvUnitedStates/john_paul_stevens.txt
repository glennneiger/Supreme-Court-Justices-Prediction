mr.
smith
you
have
said
the
whole
purpose
of
this
organization
was
to
improve
the
competitive
position
of
the
members
vis-à-vis
other
muffler
dealers.
your
opponent
argues
that
the
purpose
is
to
bargain
more
effectively
with
the
franchisor,
now
they
are
quite
two
different
concepts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
supports
your
view
of
the
relationship?
i
was
quite
persuaded
that
they
basically,
it
was
basically
a
bargaining
organization
something
like
a
union
to
help
them
renegotiate
the
contract
terms
and
handle
problems
on
terminations
and
things
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
your
argument
was
quite
different
that
you
in
fact
interpolated
the
word
entire
into
the
regulation
and
said
that
it
must
not
only
be
directed
to
improving
business
conditions
in
one
line
of
business,
but
it
must
improve
business
conditions
in
the
entire
line
of
business
and
you
then
defined
the
business
to
be
muffler
dealer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
pretty
much
adopt
the
reasoning
of
judge
kylie’s
dissent
of
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
only
a
fragment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
market
study
and
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
a
number
trade
associations
that
represent
maybe
60%,
70%
of
an
industry,
they
don’t
have
100%
membership
because
some
of
them
emphasize
certain
aspects
of
the
business,
are
they
generally
granted
the
exemption
or
not?
you
have
said
about
100%
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
everything
they
did
would
be
beneficial
to
people
in
the
muffler
industry,
but
they
happen
to
have
their
membership
comprised
just
of
the
franchise
dealers
from
midas.
say
in
other
words
they
took
the
lobbying
position
on
tax
legislation
and
things
trade
associations
generally
do,
but
their
membership
happened
to
be
composed
to
just
20%
of
the
industry
and
people
all
doing
the
same,
handling
the
same
product.
would
that
be
disqualified
because
it's
not
broad
enough
base?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
not
correct
that
you
do
grant
the
exemption
to
segments
of
an
industry
without
being
the
whole
industry
that
are
arranged
to
bargain
with
the
union
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
say
only
40%
of
the
market
gets
together
to
do
the
bargaining
with
the
union,
that
still
would
be
exempt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
here
the
doors
are
open
as
far
as
i
understand
the
record,
but
nobody
wants
to
come
in.
they
just
like
a
chevrolet
dealer
doesn’t
want
to
join
the
ford
dealer’s
organization.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
be
the
line
there
but
i
have
to
confess
i
don’t
see
in
terms
of
what
they
do
in
the
business
community?
why
these
people
are
significantly
different
from
an
industry
wide
trade
association?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
bulk
of
the
industry
doesn’t
participate,
but
what
you
look
it
as
quarter
of
an
industry
or
half
of
an
industry
for
example.
say
they
had
the,
also
the
reco
dealers
joined
up
with
them
but
then
all
other
dealer
stayed
out
and
then
they
suddenly
get
–
be
entitled
to
the
exemption
i
don’t
understand
why
its
any
different
and
they
get
together
and
talk
but
how
best
to
rearrange
franchise
terms
and
what
to
do
when
is
a
termination
of
franchise
and
all
this
sort
of
stuff,
i
just
don’t
see
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
its
purpose
is
it
to
bargain
with
midas,
not
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
farm
groups
that
bargain
with
the
farmers
i
mean
you
know
milk
dealers
bargain
with
farmers
over
milk
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
it’s
a
big
difference
alright,
but
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
collecting
taxes,
that
what
i
don’t
see.
the
tax
policy
of
which
group
should
pay
--
you
know
to
not
have
the
file
returns.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
regulations
fill
the
gap
for
the
baseball
league?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did
the
regulation
fill
the
gap
to
allow
the
exemption
for
the
baseball
leagues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
definitely
baseball
does
have
its
own
pension
program,
the
league
runs
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
it
hasn’t
here,
i
think
everybody
agrees
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
any
event
the
amendment
by
congress
which
included
football
league
did
operate
to
deprive
you
of
your
noscitur
a
sociis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
if
you
put
it
aside
then
is
still
have
the
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
forget
about
the
football
league.
justice
john
paul
stevens
litigating
over
an
awful
trivial
issue?
