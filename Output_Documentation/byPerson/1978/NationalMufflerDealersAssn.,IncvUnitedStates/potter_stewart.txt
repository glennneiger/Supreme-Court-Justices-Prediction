your
clients
get
some
dues
and
contributions
from
his
members?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
run
this
case,
will
you
have
to
file
any
returns?
justice
potter
stewart
your
exempt
from

justice
potter
stewart
no,
is

justice

but
if
you

this
case,
if
you
win
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
will
you
continued
to
file
returns?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
more
than
that
as
an
organization
it
comes
under
this
particular
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
as
any
non-profit
organization?
justice

stewart
they
are
not
the
constitutional
case
under
the
with
the
fifth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
would
drop
yourself
as
a
member.
there
would
be
no
possible
reason
for
you
belonging
to
the
organization,
would
there?
if
it’s
only
the
service,
it
would
be
of
help
to
midas
franchisee.
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
be
no
reason
to
continue
to
pay
dues?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
how
could
congress
speak
beyond
the
way
it’s
spoken?
the
question
here
is
as
i
understand
it
whether
not
this
petitioner
comes
within
the
definition
of
business
league,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
precise
question,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
of
course,
the
petitioner
says
congress
has
spoken
by
excepting
business
leagues
from
taxation
and
that
his
client
is
a
business
league?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
saying
midas
muffler
dealer’s
association
inc.
justice
potter
stewart
definitely
but
here
it
hasn’t
been,
it’s
quite
general.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
smith
isn't
really
all
that’s
at
stake
in
this
case
is
that
if
your
are
right
these
associations
have
to
be
careful
at
the
year
end
and
adjust
their
dues
periodically
and
avoid
getting
any
income,
isn't
that
all
at
stake
here?
