ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
will
address
myself
to
the
memorandum
suggesting
mootness
which
we
filed.
now,
by
no
means
intended
that
this
memorandum
be
taken
as
my
assertion
that
this
case
was
definitely
moot.
it
was
filed
because
i
felt
that
mr.
doran's
continuing
absence
compelled
me
to
inform
the
court
of
a
set
of
facts
that
might
well
render
the
case
moot.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
i
do
have
one
additional
fact
to
relate
to
the
court,
which
came
to
light
after
the
memorandum
was
filed,
however.
our
investigator
had
contacted
a
deputy
sheriff
in
bay
county
who
knew
mr.
doran
and
had
asked
him
to
look
for
mr.
doran.
shortly
after
we
received
the
attorney
general's
response
to
our
memorandum,
this
deputy
informed
us
that
he
had
seen
mr.
doran
in
a
local
hotel
about
two
months
before
last
week.
however,
he
was
unable
to
give
us
any
further
information
in
our
efforts
to
check
out
this
lead
didn't
reveal
any
further
information.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
in
bay
city.
now,
we
argued
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
they
took
the
position
that,
where
a
request
for
rendition
is
based
on
a
mere
charge
such
as
here,
an
untried
charge,
and
where
the
request
is
supported
solely
by
a
complaint
and
warrant
and
or
additional
supporting
affidavits
that
such
charging
documents
must
facially
reflect
probable
cause.
secondly
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
well,
the
record
is
somewhat
murky
as
to
the
details
surrounding
mr.
doran's
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
he
was
arrested
on
a
charge
of
possession
of
a
stolen
vehicle
in
bay
city
on
december
18th.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
it
was
the
vehicle
in
which
he
had
driven
from
arizona.
there's
--
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
apparently
a
check,
and
i'm
not
sure
of
this
and
the
record
does
not
really
clear
up
this
question.
apparently
a
check
was
run
on
the
plates
and
this
check
revealed
that
it
was
a
stolen
vehicle.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
i
don't
believe
that
was
ever
made
certain
your
honor.
he
was
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no.
he
was
shortly
thereafter
charged
with
receiving
and
concealing
a
stolen
vehicle.
however,
after
the
arizona
warrant
and
complaint
were
issued
and
a
fugitive
warrant
was
issued
in
michigan
to
hold
mr.
doran
for
extradition,
the
local
charge
was
dropped
on
february
5th,
1976.
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
faced
with
a
real
dilemma
here.
they
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
could
extradite
an
accused
fugitive,
not
a
person
convicted
of
crime
or
a
person
who
had
violated
parole
or
would
jumped
upon,
but
a
person
charged
with
crime
in
another
state.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
the
statistics
are
on
that.
however,
it's
significant
in
this
case.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
i
don't
--
i
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
extradition
maybe
he
had
on
the
mere
charge.
however
here,
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
provided
with
or
the
michigan
governor
originally
was
provided
with
documents
in
support
of
this
charge
which
did
not
contain
any
particulars
supporting
the
charge
whatsoever.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
they
are
acting
as
a
habeas
corpus
court,
under
the
right
of
habeas
corpus
that
has
been
traditionally
provided
to
accuse
fugitives.
now,
what
they
were
--
what
they
had
before
them
were
warrants
--
a
warrant,
a
complaint
and
an
affidavit
that
were
framed
entirely
in
conclusions
not
only
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes.
they
indicated
that
the
charge
should
be
made.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no,
your
honor.
what
they
said
was
that
papers
--
if
a
complaint
and
warrant
were
submitted
in
support
of
an
extradition
request
that
that
complaint
and
warrant
and
other
supporting
affidavits
or
whatever
have
to
reflect
on
their
face
sufficient
details
to
support
a
probable
cause
finding.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
they
must
show
something
besides
a
mere
conclusion
that
probable
cause
has
been
found
in
the
mere
name
of
the
charge.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no
your
honor,
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
distinguish
that
situation.
they
said
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
an
indictment.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
right.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no,
they
couldn't
--
they
couldn't
reach
that
situation.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
i
believe
the
reason
for
the
distinction
was
that
a
grand
jury
indictment
imports
a
finding
of
probable
cause
or
at
least
a
finding
that
is
equivalent
that
the
law
views
as
equivalent
to
a
finding
of
probable
cause.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
i
think
more
so,
they
would
have
come
out
more
emphatically.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
i
think
what
matter
that
strauss
is
really
dealing
with
was,
at
what
stage
does
a
criminal
prosecution
have
to
be
advanced
before
extradition
can
be
had
upon
their
charge?
the
matter
of
strauss,
the
petitioner
was
arguing
that
since
the
prosecution
had
not
advanced
beyond
the
mere
charge
had
not
advanced
to
the
state
where
he
had
been
bound
over
for
trial,
that
extradition
couldn't
be
had
on
this
basis.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor
but
perhaps
at
least
as
far
as
that
proposition
is
evident
in
matter
of
strauss,
that
case
should
be
re-examined
in
the
light
of
gerstein,
but
we
don't
have
any
dispute
was
strauss'
basic
proposition
in
the
mere
charge
is
enough
and
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
“charged”
is
to
be
construed
liberally.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
the
demanding
state
furnished
a
warrant
supported
by
a
complaint.
the
warrant
and
complaint
were
virtually
identical
in
their
language.
they
recited
the
charging
language
of
the
arizona
statutes
for
theft
of
an
automobile
or
in
the
alternative
embezzlement
of
an
automobile.
the
complaint
was
sworn
out
by
a
police
officer.
it
was
made
expressly
on
information
and
belief.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
sworn
to
before
a
magistrate.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
well,
the
complaint
was
amended
to
change
the
date
of
offense
from
december
18.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
i
don't
believe
that
the
amended
complaint
is
in
the
appendix.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
well,
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
court
had
at
its
disposal
of
the
complete
record.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes.
yes
i
did,
i
discussed
it
beforehand.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor.
however,
i
did
mention
in
my
brief
that
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
i'm
sorry
for
that
oversight,
your
honor.
however,
i
did
bring
this
up
in
the
brief
and
i
referred
the
court
to
the
record
in
this
case.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
a
warrant.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
a
warrant
accompanied
the
complaint.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
it
was.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor,
papers
were
filed
which
charge
to
crime
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
strauss
merely
--
in
my
interpretation,
strauss
takes
a
liberal
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
“charged”
not
as
to
the
substance
of
the
charge
but
as
to
how
advanced
the
charge
has
to
be,
how
advance
the
prosecution
has
to
be
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
oh
yes,
your
honor,
definitely.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
because
i
think
that
strauss
has
expanded
or
at
least
further
clarified
by
other
holdings
of
this
court
which
in
extradition
cases
which
state
that
upon
habeas
corpus
review
of
the
demanding
state's
charging
documents,
an
accuse
may
raise
a
question
of
the
substantiality
of
the
charge
and
that
this
is
a
question
of
law
and
that
it's
limited
(voice
overlap)
to
the
face
of
the
document.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor
but
that
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
well,
these
details
that
you
mentioned
are
really
not
facts,
they're
conclusions.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
they
knew
no
more
than
the
complaint
which
was
eventually
issued,
which
was
stated
on
information
and
belief.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
it's
quite
possible.
the
details
surrounding
that
charge,
as
i
mentioned,
are
extremely
murky.
the
important
point
here
is
that
the
details
surrounding
the
arizona
charge
are
also
extremely
murky.
we
have
the
owner's
name,
we
have
the
vehicle
number,
we
have
the
defendant's
name,
we
have
the
names
of
the
relevant
statutes
involved,
we
have
a
conclusion
stated
on
information
and
belief
that
these
facts
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
oh
yes,
your
honor.
oh,
yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no,
mr.
chief
justice
we're
not
calling
for
evidence,
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
careful
to
point
out,
we
do
not
suggest
that
we
inquire
into
the
underlying
facts.
what
they
were
attempting
to
do
is
make
a
confirmation
of
probable
cause
based
only
on
the
face
of
the
documents.
not
inquiring
into
the
merits
of
the
criminal
prosecutions,
because
as
this
court
has
noted,
the
question
of
probable
cause
is
viewed
as
extraneous
to
the
questions
of
guilt
or
innocence.
and
what
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
compelled
to
find
was
that
these
papers
on
their
face
were
factually
deficient
to
show
probable
cause
and
hence,
could
not
provide
a
factual
basis
for
magistrates
independent
finding
of
probable
cause.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
the
governor
of
michigan
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
but
the
issues
in
our
case
of
receiving
and
concealing
a
stolen
vehicle
are
different
from
the
issues
involved
in
the
charge
of
larceny.
and
further,
as
i
said
before,
i'm
not
willing
to
concede
that
the
charge
in
michigan
was
founded
and
even
if
it
were,
the
papers
that
michigan
was
presented
with,
even
if
there
were
additional
details
that
could
have
been
brought
to
michigan's
attention,
what
was
brought
to
michigan
attention
was
not
sufficient
to
permit
an
independent
assessment
of
the
question
of
probable
cause
by
michigan.
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
held
that
they
have
that
right
not
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
asylum
state
to
determine
whether
or
not
probable
cause
existed,
but
merely
to
confirm
the
question
of
probable
cause.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no,
the
michigan
supreme
court
stated
categorically,
this
state
cannot
extradite,
unless
provided
with
sufficient
details
in
the
case
like
this
to
confirm
a
showing
of
probable
cause.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
perhaps
this
confusion
is
resulting
from
my
ignorance
of
this
court's
procedural
rules
about
who's
responsibility
it
is
to
bring
up
the
entire
record.
it
was
my
--
when
i
receive
the
rules
from
the
clerk
instructing
us
on
how
to
prepare
an
appendix,
the
rules
seems
to
state
that
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
the
appendix
need
not
necessarily
be
complete
because
the
court
would
have
the
whole
record
before
it.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
i
assumed
that
was
here,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
record
does
not
show
that.
in
arizona,
i
believe
justicea
of
the
peace
are
not
required
to
be
lawyers.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
there's
an
indication
that
she
didn't
have
this
before
her
because
that
affidavit
was
issued
february
3rd
and
the
warrant
and
complaints
were
issued
january
7th.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no,
we
don't.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
there
might
have
been
the
arizona
procedures
as
pointed
out
by
the
attorney
general
does
provide
for
additional
investigation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
makes
it
the
magistrate's
duty
when
faced
with
the
complaint
based
solely
on
information
and
beliefs,
such
as
here.
however,
here,
there
is
no
indications
that
such
additional
investigation
ever
took
place.
and
the
facts
of
the
complaint
and
warrant
and
just
the
way
that
they
are
framed,
such
as
the
amendment
of
the
date
of
the
offense
and
the
fact
that
the
offenses
are
stated
in
the
alternative,
seem
to
indicate
that
arizona
did
not
have
additional
facts.
but,
if
they
did
have
additional
facts
it
would
have
been
of
little
imposition
on
them,
and
very
little
imposition
on
the
extradition
process
to
have
included
those
additional
facts
in
the
face
of
their
extradition
supporting
documents.
then
that's
all
we're
requesting
here.
we
never
suggested
that
the
scope
of
extradition
habeas
corpus
should
be
expanded
beyond
an
analysis
of
the
face
of
the
documents.
all
we're
suggesting
is
that
this
is
really
a
minimal
safeguard
to
impose
in
light
of
the
very,
very
serious
threat
to
personal
liberty
by
extradition.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
if
they
had
expressed
any
interest
in
doing
so,
yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor,
although
we
are
not
suggesting
that
habeas
corpus
review
be
expanded
beyond
a
legal
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
documents.
and
i
don't
--
and
i
think
if
that
were
proposed,
that
that
would
present
a
serious
question
of
whether
or
not
the
extradition
process
was
being
encumbered
and
whether
or
not
that
would
for
one
the
means
that
extradition
clause.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
oh
no,
your
honor.
oh
no,
i
don't
want
to
be
interpreted
as
saying
that.
what
i'm
suggested
here
is
just
the
minimal
requirement,
the
bottom
line,
that
if
they
don't
wish
to
make
a
factual
presentation
in
asylum
court
and
certainly
they're
not
required
to
do
so
that
they
at
least
provide
papers
showing
probable
cause
or
at
some
later
date
provided
additional
facts
upon
which
probable
cause
can
be
confirmed
and
that
was
never
done
here.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
your
honor
because
if
confirmation
of
probable
cause
is
not
had
in
the
asylum
state
prior
to
rendition,
then
the
accused
will
have
no
fourth
amendment
remedy
for
extradition,
once
extradition
takes
place.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
gerstein
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
because
gerstein
requires
a
probable
cause
determination
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
your
honor,
this
court
has
always
held
that
a
probable
cause
finding
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
maybe
subject
to
review
to
determine
if
there
were
facts
before
the
magistrate
which
really
indicate
that
he
made
an
independent
assessment
of
probable
cause.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
but
in
the
situation
of
a
conventional
arrest
or
a
conventional
search
warrant,
in
here,
extradition
poses
arguably
and
even
more
significant
restraint
than
a
mere
arrest
or
a
search.
and
since,
the
accused
will
have
no
fourth
amendment
remedy
for
extradition
once
he
returns,
it
is
important,
it
is
essential
to
require
that
the
asylum
state
be
able
to
act
as
a
reviewing
court
and
make
the
determination
of
probable
cause,
based
on
facts
efficient
to
show
that
the
magistrate
acted
independently
and
was
not
merely
rubber-stamping
the
conclusions
of
the
police.
and
if
there
was
ever
an
example
of
rubber-stamping
it
is
exists
in
the
arizona
documents
here.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes
sir.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
gerstein
afforded
the
right
to
interpose
a
probable
cause
determination
between
arrest
and
the
point
where
a
restraint
becomes
significant
and
in
the
extradition
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
but
in
an
extradition
case,
the
restraint
becomes
significant
when
the
person
is
extradited,
and
after
he's
extradited
he
has
no
remedy.
this
court
has
said
there's
no
remedy
for
extradition.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
but
there's
two
phases
to
an
extradition
arrest.
it's
not
merely
detention
in
the
demanding
state.
it's
also
forced
travel,
once
back
in
arizona
we
go
dispute
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
attorney
general
conceded
then
mr.
doran's
home
was
michigan
but
even
so
once
back
in
arizona
he
would
have
redressed,
fourth
amendment
redress
from
extended
pre-trial
restraint,
but
not
from
the
forced
travel.
he
would
have
lose
his
remedy
for
that.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
gerstein
merely
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
no.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
because
gerstein
required
a
determination
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
not
a
mere
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
because
there's
no
indication
of
the
facts
upon
which
a
neutral
and
detached
finding
a
probable
cause
could
have
been
made.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
part
of
the
neutral
and
detached
requirement
extends
to
whether
or
not
the
facts
are
sufficient
to
convince
--
a)
to
support
an
independent
finding,
a
detached
finding,
and
b)
to
satisfy
the
review
in
court,
that
such
a
detached
finding
was
made.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
yes,
that's
one
aspect
of
the
neutral
and
detached
requirement
that
was
review
in
shadwick
v.
tampa,
and
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
clerks
of
the
court
could
be
judicial
officers.
we're
not
even
contending
that
magistrate
here
was
not
judicial
officer.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
we
would
make
exactly
the
same
claim
we're
making
here,
which
is
not
to
go
behind
the
determination,
but
merely
to
confirm
the
determination
on
the
basis
of
face
of
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
or
disagree.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
but
in
an
extradition
case,
not
a
renewed
finding,
not
a
rehearing
but
a
confirmation
of
the
existence
of
probable
cause
must
be
made
if
the
accused
rights
are
to
be
protected.
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
he
might
have
--
ms.
kathleen
m.cummins
he
might
have,
he
wish
to
avail
himself
of
his
habeas
corpus
remedy
and
that
did
not
entail
an
admission
by
him
of
guilt.
