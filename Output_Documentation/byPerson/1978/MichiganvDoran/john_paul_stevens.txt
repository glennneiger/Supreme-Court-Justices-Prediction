justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
correctly
anticipated
that
if
he
stuck
it
out
in
the
michigan
courts,
he
might
ultimately
get
free,
which
he
did.
justice

stevens
even
on
then,
ms.cummins,
why
in
the
other
document
filed,
it
gives
the
name,
the
motor
number
that
vehicle,
describes
a
vehicle
that
registered
owner
of
the
vehicle,
and
he
says
he
took
it
from
that
person
on
such
and
such
a
date,
wouldn't
that
be
enough
substantiation
effect
that
there
had
been
a
--
there
was
probable
cause,
together
with
this
conclusory
statement
of
the
magistrate
that
i
have
found
probable
cause?
why
do
you
need
more
and
how
much
more
do
you
need?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
didn't
the
arresting
officers
in
michigan
verify
that
this
was
a
vehicle
and
they
arrest
him,
because
he
was
thought
to
be
in
possession
of
a
stolen
vehicle
that
this
had
been
--
i
mean
didn't
they
know
this?
