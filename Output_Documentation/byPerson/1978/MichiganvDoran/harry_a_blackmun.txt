justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
will
make
a
difference
if
you
are
in
arizona,
would
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
do
concede
this.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
simplifies
the
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
did
you
pick
him
up?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
when
did
the
arizona
warrant
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then,
it
may
have
been
said
that
the
arizona
authorities
were
relying
on
the
michigan
arrest
for
a
probable
cause?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
it
--
was
it
before
or
after
the
michigan
arrest?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
are
you
suggesting
the
michigan
jails
are
warmer
in
arizona?
i
share
with
mr.
justice
stewart's
confusion
that
(voice
overlap).
or
are
you
suggesting
that
it
doesn't
take
much
imagination
to
know
why.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ms.cummins,
may
i
ask
an
arrest
warrant
issued
in
arizona,
in
this
case,
did
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
arrest
warrant.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
it
was
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
wondered,
mr.
justice
--
my
brother
rehnquist
asked
you
about
strauss
earlier,
there's
another
excerpt
from
strauss,
that
was
the
word
“charged”
was
used
and
its
broad
signification
to
cover
any
proceeding,
which
a
state
might
see
fit
to
adopt,
by
which
a
formal
accusation
was
made
against
the
alleged
criminal.
in
the
stricter
sense
of
the
term
a
party
is
charged
when
an
affidavit
is
filed,
alleging
in
the
commission
of
the
offense,
and
a
warrant
is
issued
for
his
arrest.
and
this
is
true
whether
a
final
trial
may
or
may
not
be
had
upon
such
charge.
now,
wasn't
that
test
of
strauss
satisfied
by
the
papers
that
were
filed
in
michigan
in
this
case
by
arizona?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
but
my
question
is,
there
was
a
charge,
a
sworn
charge
of
a
crime
in
arizona,
together
with
a
warrant,
an
arrest
warrant
that
was
issued.
doesn't
strauss
suggest
that
that's
enough
to
satisfy
the
requirement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
no,
my
real
question
was,
wasn't
everything
that
was
submitted
by
arizona,
the
governor
of
michigan
in
this
case,
did
not
--
those
papers
together
satisfy
what
strauss
said
would
satisfy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
why
doesn't
strauss
cover
this
case
and
would
call
for
reversal?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ms.cummins,
i
suppose
this
is
completely
irrelevant,
but
does
the
record
show
whether
the
arizona
justice
of
the
peace
who
issued
the
arrest
warrant
was
a
lawyer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
secondly,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
have
before
her
the
nine-page
report
that
is
referred
to
in
the
supporting
affidavit
of
february
3?
