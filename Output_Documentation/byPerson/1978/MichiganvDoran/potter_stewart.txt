often
they
don't
know
who
he
is.
justice

stewart
until
he's
apprehended
in
the
asylum
state.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
say
it
takes
further
little
imagination
but
i
don't
even
have
that
minimum
amount
of
imagination
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
couldn't
be
any
worse
off
than
being
in
prison,
could
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
you
say
it
takes
further
little
imagination
to
see
(voice
overlap)
exercise
why
he
didn't
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
certainty
when
you're
in
jail,
not
a
probability.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
when
was
that
charge
dismissed?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
probably
dismissed
as
soon
as
the
people
for
arizona
arrived,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
requisition
arrived.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
he
is.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
local
hotel
in
the
state
of
michigan?
justice
potter
stewart
what
in
fact,
ms.cummins,
was
furnished
by
the
demanding
state
by
arizona
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
sworn
to?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
would
be
--
the
constitutional
provision
says
a
person
charge
in
any
state
and
that's
the
extent
of
what
it
says.
in
that
respect,
and
the
statute
says,
if
the
demanding
state
produces
a
copy
of
an
indictment
found
or
an
affidavit
made
before
a
magistrate,
would
you
concede
that
the
complaint
fits
that
description,
an
affidavit
made
before
a
magistrate,
fits
the
statutory
requirement,
the
language?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
insufficient
and
so
far
as
the
--
it
wasn't
an
insufficient
demand
so
far
as
the
statutory
language
goes?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
we
do.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
complete
record
has
been
filed
with
the
clerk
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
an
issue
that
strauss
didn't
deal
with,
that's
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
an
issue
in
strauss?
justice
potter
stewart
in
gerstein,
that's
exactly
what
was
alleged,
had
been
done.
the
--
the
people
were
arrested
and
picked
up
simply
on
information
filed
by
the
prosecutor
and
they
were
in
confinement
and
the
court
didn't
question
that
original
confinement,
that
it
did
in
gerstein.
it
simply
said
that
those
people
were
entitled
to
a
prompt
review
at
which
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
prosecution
that
show
probable
cause,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
person
would
have
all
these
--
your
client
would
have
all
these
gerstein
rights
when
it
was
returned
in
arizona,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
that
he
says
he
didn't
have
them.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that
was
a
point
after
some
confinement,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
all
the
remedies
that
gerstein
has
in
the
state
of
florida
and
that
he
would
have
had,
had
he
not
left
arizona.
justice
potter
stewart
forced
travel
back
home?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
really
want
two
bites
of
the
apple?
justice
potter
stewart
in
arizona
and
in
michigan.
