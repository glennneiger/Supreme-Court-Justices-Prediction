justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
the
asylum
state
may
at
least
demand
that
the
demanding
state
when
it
presents
its
papers
to
the
governor
of
the
asylum
state,
must
the
demanding
state
at
least
show
that
probable
cause
has
been
determined
in
that
state
before
a
warrant
was
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
the
asylum
state
may
demand
not
only
that
the
demanding
state
demonstrate
that
probable
cause
has
been
judicially
determined
in
the
demanding
state,
but
that
the
demanding
state
demonstrate
the
basis
for
that
determination?
i
know
you've
said
that
it
cannot
be
re-determined
in
the
asylum
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
re-examination?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
--
why
did
you
concede
just
what
you
did
that
the
demandings
that
the
asylum
state
may
at
least
demand
that
the
--
a
showing
that
the
demanding
state
passed
on
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
certainly
indicated
that
the
charge
had
been
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
held
that
despite
the
constitution,
something
--
some
papers
besides
indicating
something
besides
the
charge
was
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes,
so
they
must
show
something
besides
the
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
warrant
also
resided,
however,
that
a
magistrate
had
found
reasonable
cause
to
believe.
it
wasn't
--
they
just
didn't
recite
a
charge
but
he
affirmatively
recited
in
the
warrant
that
he
had
found
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
accused
had
committed
the
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
and
you
suggest
that
there
must
be
some
facts
to
support
that,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
only
some
facts
but
enough
facts
to
satisfy
the
asylum
state
that
there
really
is
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
don't
really
know
that
the
totality
of
what
was
before
the
justice
of
the
peace.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
might
have
been
personal
statements,
aren't
they.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
you
would
permit
the
demanding
state
to
participate
in
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
permit
them
to
present
evidence
of
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
you
mean
if
the
demanding
state
--
if
the
asylum
state
determine
that
the
papers
were
insufficient,
that
it
would
really
expedite
extradition
to
say
the
demanding
state
couldn't
even
supplement
the
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
matter
how
probable
cause
is
determined
in
the
demanding
state
or
had
been
determined
you
would
say
the
asylum
state
has
a
constitutional
obligation
to
review
that
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
gerstein
said
there
should
a
probable
cause
determination,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
demanding
state
says
there
has
been
then
you
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
fact
that
that
event
took
place,
why
hasn't
gerstein
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
papers
here
show
that
there
was
one
in
the
demanding
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
not
in
the
--
not
in
the
asylum
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
--
can
i
ask
you
if
--
suppose
an
information
is
filed
but
the
defendant
isn't
in
custody
and
then
the
officer
goes
before
a
magistrate,
an
independent
magistrate,
and
wants
to
get
an
arrest
warrant
and
he
gets
it
on
a
determination
of
probable
cause,
then
he
is
arrested.
now,
gerstein
doesn't
require
another
determination
of
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
this
case,
the
officers
who
swore
out
to
charge
also
got
a
warrant
from
a
magistrate.
now,
why
isn't
gerstein
on
the
face
of
the
paper
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
it
--
how
do
you
know
this
wasn't
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
this
was
a
justice
of
the
peace?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
this
warrant
have
been
signed
by
a
judge
of
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
arizona,
but
it
had
exactly
the
same
recitation
in
it,
i
have
determine
that
there's
reasonable
cause
to
believe,
etcetera.
now,
would
you
say
the
same
thing
you
were
entitled
to
go
behind
that
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
confirm
it
or
disagree
with
it,
either
one?
