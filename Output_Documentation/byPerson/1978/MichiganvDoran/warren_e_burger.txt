chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
michigan
against
doran.
mr.
derengoski,
i
think
you
can
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
he
is
in
michigan
or
in
cuba
for
the
purposes
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
why
i
picked
cuba.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
were
you
undertaking
to
tell
us
that
all
the
demanding
state
need
to
show
us
a
prima
facie
case
of
probable
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
cause
by
its
papers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
there
then
pending
of
the
possession
charged
in
the
state
of
michigan,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
said
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry
by
the
asylum
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don't
have
that
here
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wasn't
the
governor
who
did
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.cummins.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
entirely
appropriate
ms.cummins
for
you
to
do
so.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
what
most
extraditions
are,
ms.cummins?
the
overwhelming
majority
are
relating
the
person
is
merely
charged.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
the
michigan
supreme
court
reviewed
the
governor's
exercise
of
discretion
or
did
they
review
under
the
constitution
and
the
federal
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
is
indicted
by
a
grand
jury,
could
the
michigan
courts
re-examine
the
basis
upon
which
the
grand
jury
indicted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
all,
they
said
they're
not
dealing,
but
could
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what's
the
reason
for
that,
because
the
constitution
uses
the
word
“shall
surrender
up”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
you
suggesting
that
the
charge
in
michigan
had
no
basis?
the
michigan
criminal
charge
against
this
man
that
was
dismissed
is
telling
us
that
had
no
basis
in
law
in
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
didn't
justice
brewer
in
strauss
--
didn't
justice
brewer
in
strauss
emphasized
that
this
was
not
the
time
and
place
to
be
trying
out
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
be
calling
for
some
evidence
rather
than
ultimate
facts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
someone
--
some
official
in
the
state
of
michigan
make
a
determination
of
facts
that
there
are
essentially
consistent
with
the
determination
made
by
the
magistrate
in
arizona?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
not
speaking
of
the
governor,
i'm
speaking
of
whatever
judicial
or
other
officer
caused
to
be
filed
a
charge
against
doran
in
michigan
courts.
that
was
repossession
of
a
stolen
car,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
suppose
there's
a
deficiency,
some
of
deficiency
for
the
moment
in
the
conclusions
that
you
object
to,
aren't
they
supplied
to
the
state
of
michigan,
by
michigan's
own
action?
michigan
has
found
that
this
man
has
a
stolen
car
in
his
possession,
and
it
happens
to
be
the
same
car
that
arizona
said
he
took
out
of
the
state
of
arizona.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
as
a
practical
matter,
this
man
has
spent
more
than
two
years
in
michigan
jails,
when
he
might
have
had
this
whole
matter
resolved
by
simply
responding
to
the
extraditions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
hardships
cut
both
ways,
don't
they?
certainly,
when
the
hardship
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
ms.cummins.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
arrange
this,
have
it
sent
to
the
clerk.
thank
you
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
state
of
michigan
against
doran
which
involves
the
extradition
clause
of
the
constitution
and
the
uniform
criminal
extradition
act.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
not
in
consistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun
with
whom
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
joined
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
