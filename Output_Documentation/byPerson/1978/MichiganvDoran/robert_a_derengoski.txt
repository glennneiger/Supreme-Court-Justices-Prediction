mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
chief
justice
burger,
members
of
the
court,
i
first
address
the
question
in
this
cause
of
the
motion
for
dismissal
on
the
grounds
of
mootness,
which
has
been
filed
by
counsel
for
the
respondent
herein.
now,
this
is
an
extradition
case.
exactly
one
year
ago,
today
the
michigan
supreme
court
handed
down
its
decision,
setting
aside
mr.
doran's
incarceration
and
turning
him
free
on
the
basis
that
the
extradition
papers,
the
warrant
and
complaint
from
arizona
did
not
in
their
face
show
probable
cause
and
that
it
was
an
argument
in
question
and
objection
which
could
be
raised
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
asylum
state
of
michigan.
now,
the
motion
for
mootness
indicates
that
counsel
has
searched
diligently
for
mr.
doran
and
has
been
unable
to
find
him
and
that
therefore,
any
action
by
this
court
could
not
be
effectively
implemented.
i
say
to
this
court
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
mootness
that
we,
the
state
of
michigan,
probably
somewhat
greater
resources
have
attempted
not
to
locate
mr.
doran.
there's
no
reason
for
it.
after
all,
we
couldn't
do
a
thing
to
him.
it's
going
to
be
only
harassment
if
we
did
go
out
and
look
for
him,
i
presume.
he
is
free
by
a
mandate
of
the
michigan
supreme
court.
now,
admittedly,
at
the
moment
we
do
not
know
where
he
is.
however,
i
would
hate
to
say
that
precedent
should
be
that
an
appeal
to
this
court
can
be
thwarted.
indeed,
a
party
may
prevail
by
merely
not
showing
up,
i
would
say
to
your
honors
that
this
is
not
the
concept
which
would
evoke
an
order
of
this
court
dismissing
on
the
count
of
mootness,
this
cause.
now,
except
for
this
order
of
the
michigan
supreme
court,
which
we
herein
seek
to
set
aside,
there
is
a
viable
michigan
governor's
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
this
man.
and
once
if
this
court
does
set
aside
the
michigan
decree,
it
will
be
pursued
and
pursued
diligently.
otherwise,
the
very
thing
that
we
are
full
fearful
of,
as
a
result
of
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
would
indeed
come
true.
namely,
just
keep
yourself
absent.
step
over
the
boundaries
into
another
state
and
you're
home
free.
i
have
a
little
doubt
michigan
being
the
home
of
mr.
doran
and
his
family
or
remnants
there,
are
still
there
that
in
all
likelihood
he
is
in
michigan.
why
shouldn't
he
be?
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well
sir,
at
the
moment,
i
would
suggest
to
mr.
doran,
michigan,
after
all
he's
got
--
he's
safe
there.
he's
got
the
mandate
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
keeping
him
free.
now,
the
matter
--
i'll
proceed
to
the
merits
of
the
cause
sir.
we
do
not
take
exception
to
the
claim
and
the
assertion
that
the
provisors
of
the
fourth
amendment,
namely
probable
cause
for
a
warrant
are
applicable
to
cases
of
extradition.
our
big
thrust
is
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir
we
do.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
i
do
--
we
say
that
these
are
matters,
which
are
to
be
examined
in
the
courts
of
the
demanding
state.
the
concept
of
probable
cause,
i
suggest
to
the
court
can
be
somewhat
gossamer.
what
is
maybe
probable
cause
in
the
mind
of
the
governor
and
the
judge
in
arizona
may
fall
shy
of
probable
cause
in
the
minds
of
the
michigan
courts.
obviously,
it
did.
on
the
other
hand,
this
case
went
through
four
michigan
courts
before
they
found
a
court
which
said,
this
does
not
show
probable
cause
within
the
concept
that
we
have.
and
therefore,
it
must
fail,
it
can
be
raised
in
an
ancillary
proceeding
in
habeas
here,
and
we
will
discharge
this
man.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
and
we
believe
that
that
has
been
done
here.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
michigan's
examination
of
what
arizona
found
to
be
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
i
--
we,
of
course,
rely
nearly
completely
and
wholly
on
article
i.
it
is
so
clear.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
of
the
united
states
constitution,
which
says
that
upon
demand
of
the
governor
of
one
state,
the
fugitive
shall
be
rendered
up
to
the
demanding
state.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
i
--
i
stand
corrected
sir,
article
iv,
section
2.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well,
i
did
not
know
that
i
made
that
concession
sir.
if
i
did
i
certainly
retract
it.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
the
big
complaint,
as
i
get
it
here,
is
that
the
affidavit
in
complaint,
whereby
in
pursuant
to
which
the
warrant
of
arrest
was
issued
merely
stated
the
crime
in
the
“conclusory”
language
of
the
statute.
but
it
showed
who,
what,
where,
when
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
the
original
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
no
sir.
it
was
sent
back
and
returned.
it
was
a
stenographic
error
in
the
original
warrant.
and
it
was
corrected
to
show
december
3rd,
1975,
instead
of
the
same
date
in
which
he
was
picked
up
in
michigan.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
about
--
let's
see,
we
picked
him
up
sir
on
december
18th,
1975.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh,
the
arizona,
i
think
was
issued
in
the
middle
of
january
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
we
picked
him
up
december
18th,
1975
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
arizona
issued
01-07-76,
less
than
a
month
later
the
arizona
warrant
issued
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
no
sir.
there
was
a
complaint
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
arizona
court.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
it
was
sometime
between
december
18th
and
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
it
was
after
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well,
that's
right
sir.
they
didn't
know
where
this
man
was,
until
michigan
said
we
have
him.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
i
suppose
but
to
--
what
avail
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
not
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
most
of
the
extraditions
that
i
have
dealt
with
did
that,
yes
sir.
after
the
asylum
state
advised
the
ultimate
demanding
state
that
we
have
one
of
your
people.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
that's
right.
and
how
this
happened
sir
was
he
was
driving
this
allegedly
stolen
vehicle
in
bay
city,
michigan,
and
it
was
making
too
much
noise
as
i
understand.
there
was
a
complaint,
and
that
the
officers
came
and
they
check
through
lien
and
found
that
this
was
a
stolen
vehicle
in
arizona.
and
then
he
was
charged
in
michigan
with
receiving
and
concealing
stolen
property,
which
charge
is
automatically
dismissed
upon
the
arrival
of
the
arizona
requisition.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh
yes
sir,
oh
that
would
be
a
heinous
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well,
i
suppose
it's
less
than
five
years
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
it
could,
yes
sir.
but
you
got
to
recall
sir
that
during
the
time
that
he
was
incarcerated
in
bay
city,
he
was
attempting
these
habeas
actions
through
the
michigan
courts.
and
you
know
sir,
it
takes
very
little
imagination
to
know
why
this
man
would
rather
molder
in
a
michigan
jail
than
assert
himself
to
his
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
in
arizona.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
now,
historically
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
obviously,
he
didn't
want
to
run
the
risk
of
conviction
and
sentence
in
arizona.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir,
i
can
understand
that.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
obviously,
he
believed
the
risk
of
conviction
and
sentence
in
arizona
was
so
very
probable
that
he'd
rather
sit
in
the
michigan
jail.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir
and
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
it
was
dismissed
in
january
of
1976,
when
the
arizona
requisition
arrived
and
the
governor
of
michigan
issued
his
warrant
of
arrest
pursuant
to
the
arizona
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
perhaps
sir,
perhaps.
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
obviously,
he
did
not
want
the
arizona
conviction
and
probable
sentence
that
would
follow.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh
yes
sir,
it
took
four
courts
for
the
man
(voice
overlap).
yes
sir.
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
well
sir,
yes,
but
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh,
no
sir.
i
would
never
subscribe
to
that
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
he
was
obviously
afraid
of
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
i
would
--
i
will
always
assume,
evidently
he
didn't.
the
question
of
whether
or
historically
and
under
the
rulings
of
this
court,
in
the
asylum
state,
you
questioned
or
may
question
the
fugitivity,
the
identity
of
the
accuse,
in
this
case
we
had
his
picture
and
whether
what
he
did
was
a
crime
under
the
laws
of
the
demanding
state,
and
whether
he
indeed
was
in
the
demanding
state
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
crime.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
just
to
make
sure
that
this
man
is
charged
that
he
was
in
the
demanding
state
and
that
you
have
the
right
to
the
person.
now,
the
michigan
supreme
court
went
off
very
heavily
on
the
district
circuit
decision
by
judge
kelly
wright
in
kirkland.
and
they
also
--
i's
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
justice
kelly
wright,
with
all
differs
him,
much
of
his
opinion
was
based
on
compassion.
and
i
say
that
is
a
proper
ingredient
in
the
administration
of
our
laws
that
should
not
be
so
weighted
as
to
frustrate
a
constitutional
provision.
now,
justice
or
judge
wright
mentioned,
you
know,
hauling
this
people
away
from
their
home
to
a
foreign
jurisdiction
and
all
the
problems
that
could
come
in
that
regard.
well,
actually
in
most
of
these
cases,
these
people
are
merely
being
sent
back
home.and
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
not
sending
these
fugitives
off
to
some
primitive
state,
some
nether
region.
we
are
sending
them
off
to
a
sister
sovereign
state
of
this
union,
whereby
all
of
the
constitutional
rights
will
be
given
to
him.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh
yes
sir.
i
seriously
consider
have
problems
with
this
--
i'm
not
sure
the
kentucky
versus
dennison
says
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh
that's
right
sir.
and
i
seriously
question
the
propriety
of
these
governors
in
the
exercise
of
executive
clemency
doing
by
indirection
and
frustrating
article
iv
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
no
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
no
sir,
it
was
not.
it's
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
so,
i
say
to
the
court
that
all
of
these
protections,
these
arguments
should
be
raised
in
the
demanding
state
where
the
evidence
is
there,
where
the
witnesses
are
there,
unless
we
can
have
that
as
a
law
of
this
land,
you
could
have
48
states
which
become
havens
for
every
bail
bond
jumper
in
the
country.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
fifty.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
any
rebuttal
that
may
be
necessary.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
forego
the
remainder
of
my
time,
but
i
would
like
to
say
this
sir.
i
have
bare
a
heavy
responsibility
as
the
petitioner
for
the
preparation
of
the
appendix
and
the
amended
complaint
and
warrant
are
at
62a
and
64a.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
no
sir,
its
not
in
here.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir,
i
believe
it
is?
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes
sir,
we'll
file
it
with
the
clerk.
