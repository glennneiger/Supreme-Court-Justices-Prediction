justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
doesn't
a
warrant
show
that
arizona
says
that
this
man
stole
a
car
in
arizona
on
the
same
day
he
was
under
arrest
in
michigan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
possible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
when
was
the
warrant
issued?
how
long
after
the
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
the
arizona
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
wasn't
issued
until
after
he
was
picked
up
in
michigan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
after
michigan
notified
arizona,
that
was
when
it
was
issued?
justice
thurgood
marshall
real
collaboration.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
was
after
michigan
notified
arizona?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
far
the
records
on
arizona
didn't
know
anything
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
say
that,
they
could
have
issued
the
warrant
without
knowing
where
he
was,
couldn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
they
usually
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
you
ever
heard
of
--
can
you
give
me
any
case
where
this
happened,
where
a
warrant
was
issued
after
the
man
was
arrested
in
another
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
when
they
issued
the
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
you
kept
him
in
jail
for
two
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
amount
of
time
you
get
for
stealing
the
vehicle
in
arizona?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
be
two,
couldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
just
want
you
to
abide
by
the
law,
that's
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
two
years
was
after
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
think
that
there's
a
good
possibility
that
this
man
is
innocent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can't
get
--
all
your
assumption
is
that
he's
going
to
be
convicted
in
arizona.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
kept
--
didn't
you
just
say
that
the
reason
he
did
it
was
because
if
he
went
to
arizona
he'd
be
convicted?
didn't
you
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
you
don't
assume
that
the
man
is
innocent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
now
fifty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.cummins,
would
you
--
is
there
any
explanation
in
the
arrest,
in
the
records
as
to
the
original
michigan
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
again,
what
was
he
arrested
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
same
vehicle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
does
he
--
how
do
you
know
it's
the
same
vehicle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
he
was
arrested
because
he
was
driving
a
car
without
a
state
license?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
was
after
he
was
arrested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you've
backed
up
a
little
i
want
to
know
when
he
was
arrested,
they
said
you
are
arrested
for
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
know,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall

the
complaint
--

that
date
of
january,
of
december

justice
thurgood
marshall

this
appendix?
justice
thurgood
marshall

it
get
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
you
work
on
this
appendix?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
left
these
--
you
left
two
documents
in
here
that
were
corrected,
and
you
didn't
put
the
corrected
ones
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
want
me
to
rule
with
you
and
you
don't
even
give
me
the
documents
to
go
with
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall

justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i'm
saying
madam
--
justice
thurgood

few
minutes
ago.

thurgood

what
i
was
asking
about
it,

in
the
appendix,
you
were
right.

thurgood
marshall

entire
transcript
