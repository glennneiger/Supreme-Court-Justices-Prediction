justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
conceive
that
with
respect
with
probable
cause?
you're
dealing
with
a
provision
of
the
constitution
that
was
adapted
in
1787
about
the
interstate
rendition
of
fugitives,
and
you're
dealing
with
a
fourth
amendment
provision
that
was
held
applicable
to
the
states
only
in
1961?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
article
i
of
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
was
article
iv,
section
2?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
if
you
rely
on
that
why
do
you
get
to
the
issue
of
probable
cause
under
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
suggesting
he
was
following
hamlet's
advised
that
we
would
rather
bear
those
evils
we
have
than
flee
to
others
that
we
know
not
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
governor
of
michigan
can
exercise
compassion
under
kentucky
against
dennison
if
he
wants
to,
can
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
says
the
duty
can't
be
enforced
by
mandamus.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
constitution
say
that
a
person
charged
in
any
state
with
treason,
felony,
or
other
crime,
we
shall
flee
from
justice,
and
be
found
in
any
other
state,
shall,
on
demand
of
the
executive
authority
of
the
state
from
which
he
fled
be
delivered
up?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where's
the
dilemma
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
just
a
charge
without
any
supporting
papers
have
been
furnished
to
the
michigan
authority,
would
the
michigan
supreme
court
have
come
out
the
same
way
in
your
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
it
isn't
a
question
of
the
arizona
authorities
having
furnished
too
much.
it's
the
question
that
any
demanding
state
mush
furnish
not
only
evidence
of
a
charge
but
evidence
of
probable
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
statement
in
matter
of
strauss,
the
opinion
this
court
by
justice
brewer,
where
he
says
that
who
would
doubt
that
an
information
is
sufficient?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
strauss,
the
court
does
say
an
information
would
be
sufficient,
which
is
what
was
involved
in
gerstein
against
pugh,
and
this
court
held
was
not
sufficient
for
probable
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
michigan
supreme
court
really
didn't
hold
that
they
had
that
right
in
the
sense
of
the
governor
miller
can
have
that
right,
they
said
that
governor
miller
couldn't
execute
the
extradition
warrant
because
the
federal
constitution
prohibited
from
doing
so,
until
they
made
that
determination,
didn't
they?
this
wasn't
a
question
of
kentucky
against
dennison
type
of
thing,
where
michigan
voluntarily
says
we
won't
do
it
until
we're
satisfied.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
reason
was
the
federal
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
saying
that
she
acted
wrongly
not
that
she
was
not
neutral
and
detached.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
shadwick
against
city
of
tampa
which
justice
powell
wrote
for
the
court
some
years
ago,
we
held
that
city
clerks
of
this
tampa
were
neutral
and
detached
magistrates.
and
i
don't
think
we
felt
that
incumbent
to
review
all
the
probable
cause
determination
they've
made
over
the
course
of
six
months
or
year
to
decide
whether
they're
neutral
and
detached.
it's
just
wasn't
separate
from
prosecuting
her.
