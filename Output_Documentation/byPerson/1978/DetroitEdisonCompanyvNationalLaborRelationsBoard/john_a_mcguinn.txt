mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
you
this
morning
concerns
the
subject
of
employee
aptitude
testing
and
whether
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith
requirement
of
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act
requires
those
increasing
numbers
of
employers,
both
public
and
private
who
used
testing
whether
it
requires
them
to
turnover
to
unions
copies
of
the
actual
tests
involved,
the
actual
tests,
sheets,
submitted
by
the
applicants
and
the
scores
achieved
by
the
applicants
linked
with
the
name
of
the
applicant.
in
order
to
place
this
issue
in
its
proper
factual
contexts,
a
few
points
have
to
be
stressed.
first,
the
test
involved
in
this
case,
the
minnesota
paper
form
board
test
and
the
six
part
epsat
test
are
aptitude
tests.
it
do
not
measure
the
acquired
knowledge
needed
of
a
detroit
edison
instrument
man.
they
just
test
the
ability
to
get
that
knowledge.
and
the
job
involved
in
this
case,
the
instrument
man
job
is
one
of
critical
importance
to
this
company.
this
employer
works
on
precision
instruments,
technically
complex.
he
is
in
fact
in
charge
of
the
nervous
system
of
the
power
plant.
now
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
instrument
man
test
battery
is
highly
predictive
of
success
on
the
job.
there
is
an
80%
chance
that
those
scoring
above
the
10.3
cutoff
score
will
be
successful
performers
on
a
job
and
conversely
there
is
an
80%
chance
that
those
scoring
below
10.3
will
be
unsuccessful
instrument
man.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
it
bears
on
the
argument
of
the
relevance
of
the
test
items
to
the
union.
if
we
take
it
as
a
given
that
this
test
that
this
test
is
a
valid
predictor
of
performance
on
the
job,
i
say
that
the
union
does
not
need
the
test
items
themselves
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
order
to
carry
on
their
statutory
function
of
representing
the
employees.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes.
i
think
we
have
a
very
suspect
test
here.
yes,
the
test
should
be
turned
over
to
a
psychologist
to
the
union's
choice
for
him
to
make
a
determination.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
no,
i
would
not
want
general
disclosure
because
that
ruins
the
validity
of
the
test.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
no
your
honor,
it
did
not.
the
detroit
edison
company
in
fact
made
that
suggestion
at
the
outset
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
hearing
to
the
administrative
law
judge.
exactly,
the
suggestion
that
he
took,
that
is
to
turn
over
to
a
psychologist
of
the
union's
choice.
next,
i
think
you
must
understand
that
this
company
furnished
the
union
with
what
judge
white,
dissenting
judge
white
found
was
a
wealth
of
information
on
its
testing
program.
this
included
the
two
validation
studies
done
on
the
test.
some
146
sample
items
similar
to
but
not
identical
to
the
items
on
the
two
tests
themselves
an
explanation
of
the
battery
weights
and
the
raw
scores
on
the
tests.
the
raw
scores
achieved
by
the
applicants
on
the
tests
but
not
linking
it
with
the
name
of
the
applicant
just
putting
it
by
alphabetical
designation
and
an
offer
to
release
the
scores
linked
with
the
names
of
the
applicants
for
any
applicant
who
consented
to
such
release
and
finally
and
most
importantly,
the
offer
to
disclose
the
test
to
a
qualified
psychologist
of
the
union's
choice.
a
final
factual
consideration
is
that
during
the
pendency
of
the
labor
board
case,
the
union
prosecuted
grievances
of
the
unsuccessful
applicants
to
arbitration.
in
these
proceedings,
the
union
sought
copies
of
the
test
materials
that
they
are
seeking
in
this
case.
and
the
arbitrator
found
in
view
of
the
wealth
of
material
that
the
company
did
furnish,
that
production
of
the
actual
tests
was
irrelevant
to
this
consideration
of
the
case
and
also
as
the
result
of
that
proceeding,
i
think
you
should
know
that
the
arbitrator
affected
a
compromise
between
the
position
of
the
union
and
the
position
of
the
company
whereby
he
told
the
company
to
reconsider
three
applicants
who
scored
just
below
the
10.3
cutoff
and
as
a
result
to
that
reconsideration,
the
company
in
fact
hired
one
of
those
three
persons.
this
then
is
the
broad
factual
context
in
which
this
company
has
found
to
have
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
the
classical
argument
of
this
case
would
start
with
an
analysis
of
whether
the
test
information
was
of
probable
relevance
and
usefulness
to
the
union
in
carrying
out
its
statutory
duties
and
responsible
under
the
acme
case.
now,
with
your
indulgence,
i
would
like
to
leap
ahead
and
assume
for
the
moment
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
this
information
had
some
marginal
relevance
to
the
union's
function.
our
conclusion
is
still
the
same.
the
test
material
should
not
be
turned
over
to
the
union
directly.
why?
i
think
we
could
--
we
should
start
with
the
only
common
premise
we
share
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
this
case
and
that
is
as
the
board
acknowledges
in
footnote
25
of
its
brief,
there
is
a
very
strong
public
policy
in
favor
of
preventing
the
compromised
of
employment
tests
through
dissemination.
that
public
policy
is
rooted
in
the
common
sense
fair
play
notion,
the
distribution
of
an
employment
aptitude
test
to
persons
who
may
take
the
test
in
the
future,
destroys
the
validity
of
the
test
as
a
predictor
of
employee
performance
and
places
those
who
have
not
seen
the
test
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
to
those
who
have
seen
the
test.
in
this
common
sense,
fair
play
notion
has
been
incorporated
in
standards
for
education
and
psychological
tests
and
manuals
published
by
the
american
psychological
association
which
in
turn
have
been
incorporated
into
the
eeoc
guidelines
on
testing.
now,
since
the
filing
of
our
brief,
the
joint
agency
guidelines
on
testing,
standard
i-5
of
the
apa
standards
states
that
for
tests
other
than
achievement
test,
prior
knowledge
of
the
test
items
can
destroy
validity.
in
standard
j-2
of
those
same
standards
states
the
test
scores
should
be
reported
only
to
those
qualified
to
interpret
them.
and
the
eeoc
guidelines
expressly
require
safeguards
to
protect
the
security
of
test
scores.
this
court
on
three
recent
occasions,
the
griggs
case,
the
albemarle
case,
and
the
washington
versus
davis
case
has
held
that
the
eeoc
guidelines
are
entitled
to
great
difference
and
should
be
regarded
as
expressing
the
will
of
congress.
this
court
in
the
albemarle
case
specifically
approved
the
eeoc's
reliance
on
the
apa
standards
i've
just
mentioned.
the
common
sense
fair
play
concept
behind
employment
test
security
was
recently
underlined
by
the
second
circuit.
in
the
kirkland
case
where
that
court
struck
down
a
district
court
ruling
which
would
have
provided
that
any
new
employment
test
would
be
reviewed
by
the
plaintiffs.
the
board
itself
prior
to
this
case
acknowledged
this
common
sense
fair
play
concept
when
its
general
counsel
in
1960
refused
even
to
issue
a
complaint
in
which
the
union
sought
to
review
employment
aptitude
test.
the
board's
general
counsel
at
that
time
referred
to
the
“unique
character”
of
the
test
and
held
that
an
advanced
inspection
would
permit
the
content
of
the
test
to
be
widely
disseminated
thus
impairing
the
usefulness
of
the
test.
now,
the
board's
sole
answer
to
this
admitted
strong
policy
was
to
invent
what
they
called
a
restriction.
a
(inaudible)
statement
that
the
union
was
not
to
copy
the
tests
or
disseminate
them
and
was
to
return
them
to
the
company
after
the
arbitration
proceeding.
no
restriction
at
all
was
placed
on
the
dissemination
of
the
test
scores
linked
with
the
name
of
the
application.
this
could
presumably
be
printed
in
the
detroit
free
press.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
no,
it
would
not
compromise
the
test
but
it
would
compromise
the
validity
as
seen
by
the
eeoc.
the
eeoc
says
that
a
test
scores
should
not
be
distributed.
you
see,
it
leads
to
a
situation
where
somebody
who
scores
12.5
on
this
is
then
compared
with
somebody
who
scored
12.3
on
it.
there
is
no
reason,
as
the
arbitrator
said,
"this
test
is
good
because
it
doesn't
compare
somebody's
score
with
that
of
somebody
else's
score".
it's
just
as
reported
in
terms
of
not
recommended
or
acceptable.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well,
by
reliance
on
the
eeoc's
guidelines
your
honor
is
the
reliance
that
this
court
placed
on
those
guidelines
in
the
decisions
that
i
mentioned.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well
that's
correct.
i
can
only
say
what
the
court
did
in
the
albemarle
case
and
washington
versus
davies
case
and
they
said
these
guidelines
were
entitled
to
“great
deference”
and
should
be
regarded
as
expressing
the
will
of
congress.
those
are
the
court's
words.
and
so
i
think
that
when
i
am
placed
in
a
situation
of
the
detroit
edison
company
where
i
have
to
follow
title
vii
as
well
as
follow
the
national
labor
relations
board,
you
have
put
me
into
an
impossible
situation
when
you
say,
"give
the
union
the
tests
and
the
test
scores".
as
i
said
no
restriction
at
all
was
placed
on
the
dissemination
of
the
test
scores
linked
by
the
name
of
the
applicant.
now,
the
board
seeks
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
that
there
was
on
the
test.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes,
like
dissenting
judge
white
on
the
court
of
appeals,
i
can
only
suggest
to
you
that
the
board's
position
is
really
naïve
in
the
real
world
in
which
we
find
ourselves.
it
is
really
naïve
because
first,
once
the
materials
have
been
given
to
the
union,
the
company
has
lost
control
over
them
and
it
places
on
the
company
the
admittedly
new
and
very
difficult
burden
of
policing
and
enforcing
that
restriction.
second,
as
organizations
properly
responsive
to
their
member's
desires
and
without
the
professional
standards
and
responsibilities
of
professional
psychologists
unions
are
in
a
uniquely
poor
position
to
prevent
dissemination
of
the
materials.
in
the
real
world
of
today,
the
ubiquitous
with
its
copying
machine
which
everyone
has
requires
extraordinary
measures
of
security
to
prevent
widespread
dissemination.
these
are
measures
not
ordinarily
used
or
available
to
labor
organizations.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
psychologist?
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes,
that
psychologist
is
under
a
professional
responsibility
not
to
divulge
tests
and
test
scores
linked
with
the
name
of
the
applicant.
yes,
we're
taking
a
risk,
very
large
risk
but
it's
a
risk
that
we
think
is
--
strikes
the
proper
kind
of
a
balance.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
no,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
under
--
make
that
assumption.
i
think
we're
talking
more
here
about
inadvertent
disclosure,
the
kind
of
thing
where
the
test
is
put
on
somebody's
desk
and
somebody
picks
it
up
or
it's
in
a
drawer
without
proper
safeguards.
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
situation
we're
really
talking
to
hear
as
opposed
to
the
intention
of
the
business.
however,
i
think
we
would
be
a
little
naïve
if
we
didn't
realize
this
record
shows
a
decade's
long
hostility
by
this
union
to
the
entire
concept
of
promotion
other
than
promotion
by
seniority,
in
other
words,
hostility
to
testing.
and
like
dissenting
judge
white,
i
can
only
wonder
why
the
union
after
being
given
a
wealth
of
materials
on
the
testing
programs,
still
wants
copies
of
the
actual
tests
and
the
actual
test
sheets.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
the
psychologist
--
the
importance
of
the
psychologist
to
this
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
aptitude
exam.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
a
test
of
what
is
required
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
--
of
the
instrument
man.
therefore
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
the
psychologists
are
the
experts
in
the
testing
business.
that's
exactly
it.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
pardon.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well
that's
correct
too,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
that's
right.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
--
is
basically
a
clerical
function.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
there
are
multiple
choice
questions.
you
can
see
the
samples
in
the
appendix
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
the
kinds
of
questions.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes.
in
this
case,
a
machine
doesn't
do
it.
it's
done
clerically
but
any
clerical
person.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
that
is
correct
and
we
have
people
within
the
psychology
group
who
do
actually
grade
these
tests.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
no
you
do
not.
as
it
happened,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
they
do
have
expertise
but
that
is
not
necessary
obviously
to
grade
a
multi-choice
test.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
of
course.
i
think
the
next
problem
we
have,
i
have
with
the
restriction
is
that
there
is
a
built
in
ambiguity
about
this
restriction,
about
just
what
individuals
comprised
the
union
to
whom
i
am
supposed
to
give
over
these
materials.
as
i
showed
in
my
brief,
this
could
be
a
very
few
people,
or
it
could
be
a
very
large
number
of
people.
the
board's
order
or
its
restriction
does
not
make
it
clear
who
it
--
who
is
it
to
run
to.
and
all
of
those
persons
who
would
be
seeing
these
materials
are
also
employees
of
the
company
who
would
be
in
a
position
to
take
the
test
themselves
in
the
future.
and
the
board
is
clearly
off
the
mark
when
it
suggests
that
we,
the
company,
could
extract
a
pledge
from
these
union
officials
that
they
would
never
take
the
test
in
the
future.
i
can
think
of
no
clear
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
act
to
tell
the
union
officials
they
must
forego
promotional
opportunities
because
of
their
membership
and
activities
in
regard
to
a
labor
union.
fifth,
even
if
the
company
were
able
to
detect
a
violation
of
the
restriction,
he
would
have
no
independent
remedy.
it
would
have
to
rely
upon
the
board's
general
counsel
to
seek
contempt
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
very
difficult
for
me
to
consider
how
a
union
can
be
held
in
contempt
when
the
basic
order
runs
against
the
company
and
not
the
union
and
the
union
wasn't
even
a
party
to
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
sixth,
even
if
the
union
were
found
liable
in
contempt
for
a
violation
of
the
restriction,
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
since
this
company's
testing
program
would
have
been
gutted
and
would
take
years
to
make
another
revalidation
study.
and
seventh,
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
basis
of
the
judicial
protective
order
in
the
sanction
of
contempt
for
its
violation,
what
will
happen
next
when
unions
generally
seek
such
information
from
other
employers.
must
employers
in
order
to
obtain
this
judicial
contempt
protection
refuse
again
to
disclose
the
information,
go
through
a
meaningless
board
proceeding,
a
meaningless
court
of
appeals
proceeding
just
to
get
the
judicial
contempt
sanction
protection.
literally,
that's
the
only
way
that
another
employer
down
the
road
is
going
to
be
able
to
do
it.
and
yet
that
makes
no
common
sense
at
all.
and
the
only
other
alternative
would
be
for
the
employer
to
extract
a
contractual
commitment
against
disseminating
a
material
from
the
union
and
the
only
remedy
for
a
violation
of
that
is
an
ordinary
breach
of
contract
suit.
thus,
it
is
apparent
that
even
this
chimera
of
judicial
contempt
sanction
protection
will
extend
no
further
than
the
case
in
front
of
you
today
if
it's
accepted
by
this
court.
let
me
now
leap
backward
for
a
moment
and
talk
about
the
threshold
question
of
whether
the
testing
materials
involved
had
any
probable
relevance
or
usefulness
to
the
union
under
this
court's
decision
in
acme
industrial
company.
in
here,
we
have
to
distinguish
between
the
test
and
test
sheets
on
the
one
hand
and
these
test
scores
linked
with
the
name
of
the
applicant
or
the
other.
going
first
to
the
test,
consider
first
the
wealth
of
material
that
the
union
was
given
about
the
testing
program
including
the
validation
studies
themselves,
including
the
sample
questions
given
to
the
union.
next,
consider
that
the
three
professional
industrial
psychologists
who
testified
in
either
the
arbitration
case
or
the
board
hearing,
each
concluded
that
a
review
of
the
test
itself
would
not
be
helpful
in
determining
whether
the
particular
test
was
valid.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
and
we
think
that
that
was
a
valid
way
of
responding
to
the
union's
request
for
information
that
we
didn't
have
to
respond
to
it
in
exactly
the
way
the
union
wanted
to
get
it.
we
gave
what
we
considered
to
be
the
most
relevant
information
and
that
is
the
validation
studies
themselves.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
turn
over
the
validation
studies,
yes.
i
think
we
went
one
step
further
when
we
gave
them
sample
copies
of
the
--
of
items
that
were
similar
to
but
not
the
same
as
items
on
the
test
itself.
i
think
that
was
a
very
helpful
thing.
i
don't
know
whether
that
was
strictly
speaking
required
by
the
act.
i
think
the
validation
studies
were.
in
answer
to
these
three
professional
industrial
psychologists,
the
union
produced
no
witness
whatsoever
who
was
a
professional
psychologist
and
the
board
produced
none.
so
that
evidence
is
uncontradicted
on
this
record.
another
potent
consideration
on
the
issue
of
relevancy
in
my
opinion
is
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator
himself
concluded
that
a
review
of
the
tests
would
prove
nothing
and
that
the
union's
case
was
in
no
way
damaged
by
lack
of
access
to
the
test.
of
course
this
court
has
on
many
occasions
held
that
arbitration
is
the
preferred
method
of
solving
labor
relations
disputes.
that
was
done
in
this
case
and
it
was
done
without
the
necessity
of
production
of
the
test.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
without
an
actual
case
or
controversy
in
other
words?
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
i
think
that
this
would
have
to
be
in
conjunction
with
a
real
live
--
life
case.
i
just
don't
think
these
academic
inquiries
sent
to
a
company
at
large
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well
it
is
not
strictly
speaking
academic
now
because
the
arbitrator
pursuant
to
the
agreement
of
both
parties
said
that
the
arbitration
proceeding
could
be
reinstituted
if
the
testing
materials
were
in
fact
ordered
to
be
produced
by
a
court.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that
the
arbitrator
is
really
going
to
change
his
mind
if
this
court
should
determine
that
the
test
should
be
made
public.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well,
that's
an
interesting
point
whether
an
academic
inquiry
that
comes
in
out
of
the
blue,
we
would
like
to
see
xyz
material
concerning
your
testing
program
whether
that
would
lead
to
an
8
(a)
(5)
kind
of
an
answer.
i
tend
to
--
this
company
believes
in
disclosing
as
much
as
possible
to
the
employees
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
your
question
for
this
company
would
be,
yes
we
would
be
happy
to
disclose
the
validation
study.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
it
was,
strictly
speaking.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well
my
question
would
be
what
is
the
request
now
relevant
to
of
the
arbitration
proceeding
is
over?
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well,
in
order
to
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice,
we
would
have
had
to
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
alright.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
apparently,
the
premise
of
your
hypothetical
was
that
the
arbitration
proceeding
is
now
over.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
alright,
thank
you.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
try
to
answer
the
question
pending
at
the
break,
i
believe
from
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
stewart.
as
i
understand
it,
the
question
is
whether
the
company
is
under
a
legal
obligation
to
provide
the
union
information
of
the
type
provided
by
the
company
in
this
case
even
if
there
is
no
pending
specific
grievance.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
that
once
the
union
has
made
a
showing
of
probable
relevance
and
usefulness,
whether
that
request
is
broadly
framed
or
tied
into
a
particular
grievance,
the
obligation
attaches
to
disclose
materials
such
a
validation
study.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
we
concede
that
the
testing
program
does
affect
wages
and
other
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
maybe
if
you
could
repeat
your
question.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
no,
it
will
not
your
honor.
and
the
same
is
true
here.
if
once
the
grievance
is
resolved
in
arbitration
and
the
union
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
seek
the
information,
the
result
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes,
that
--
it
would
not
be
moot
just
because
the
arbitration
was
concluded.does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes
your
honor.
i
do
want
to
answer
the
contention
made
that
we
somehow
lost
our
right
to
challenge
the
relevance
of
these
materials
by
the
lack
of
file
and
exception
to
the
finding
of
relevance
in
the
board
proceeding.
mr.
come
is
factually
correct.
no
exception
was
filed
to
the
--
that
portion
of
the
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge.
the
reason
that
no
exception
was
filed
was
the
obvious
one
that
the
administrative
law
judge
had
adopted
a
recommendation
made
by
the
company
at
the
outset
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
hearing.
the
company
did
this
expressly
“to
appease
the
union”
not
as
a
confession
of
relevance
of
the
materials.
what
earthly
reason
would
the
company
have
for
filing
an
exception
to
that
portion
of
a
decision
it
deemed
favorable
to
its
own
interest.
filing
an
exception
in
those
circumstances
in
my
opinion
would
have
been
an
indication
of
bad
faith,
a
withdrawal
from
a
proposal
that
we
made
to
the
union
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing.
i
think
it's
most
important
in
this
context
to
remember
that
this
is
a
labor
relations
case
and
that
in
labor
relations,
each
party
often
makes
concessions
to
the
other
in
order
to
appease
them.
that's
how
this
system
works.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
because
i
think
that
we
made
an
offer
to
the
administrative
law
judge
as
well
as
to
the
union.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
and
the
administrative
law
judge
was
a
part
of
this
process
too
and
i
just
think
it
would
be
undercutting
the
commitment
if
you
will,
that
we
gave
to
the
administrative
law
judge
that
this
is
something
that
we
could
live
with.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
--
taking
a
very
technical
and
mechanistic
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
--
approach
to
some
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
i
think
the
argument
is
preserved
here
today.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well
i
just
think
it
would
be
a
most
unfortunate
result
for
industrial
relations
generally.
if
efforts
made
by
one
party
to
appease
the
other
party
were
later
translated
into
a
finesse
of
the
appeaser's
legal
rights
and
that's
what
i
think
has
happened
here.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
it
does
your
honor.
i'm
not
arguing
with
that.
i'm
telling
you
this
is
a
labor
relations
case
and
some
considerations
not
to
be
given
to
that
fact
when
you
--
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
well,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
i
am
attempting
to
sensitize
you
to
the
fact
that
in
labor
relations,
sometimes
we
make
concessions
to
appease
another
party.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
ought
to
be
penalized
for
making
concessions
like
that.
mr.
john
a.
mcguinn
no,
we
are
bound
by
the
statute.
we
are
bound
by
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
rest.
