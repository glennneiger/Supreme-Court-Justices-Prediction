mr.
come,
can
you
clarify
something
for
me
please?
earlier
in
your
argument,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
as
an
example
of
why
the
union
wanted
these
tests
that
it
might
be
able
to
prove
that
one
of
the
applicants
for
this
instrument
man
b
had
performed
that
identical
function
or
a
function
very
similar
to
it
somewhere
else
very
efficiently.
if
that
is
so,
in
what
way
would
a
test
assist
the
union?
why
can't
it
prove
that
any
way
without
having
possession
of
the
test
and
the
scores?
justice
harry

well
let's
assume
that
--
justice
harry

blackmun
but
if
smith
had
been
an
instrument
man
b
in
another
utility
plant
and
had
received
the
highest
rating
for
his
performance
and
let's
assume
further
that
he
was
the
lowest
man
on
this
test
scores,
i
don't
understand
how
it
would
make
any
difference
in
the
union's
effort
to
prove
that
he
was
confident
to
do
the
job
head
and
shoulders
above
anybody
else
because
it
already
proved
it.
