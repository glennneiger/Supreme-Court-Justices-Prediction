justice

i
can
fully
understand
why
the
expertise
of
a
psychologist
would
be
an
important
ingredient
in
the
devising
of
these
test
batteries
but
i
should
think
any
school
boy
could
mark
the
papers
so
to
speak,
couldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
or
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
i
suppose,
there
are
multiple
choice
questions,
true
or
false
or
something
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
a
machine
could
almost
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
any
layman
--
any
letter
layman
could
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
need
a
psychologist's
expertise
to
grade
them,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mcguinn,
to
go
back
for
a
moment
to
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
just
told
us.
do
you
concede
that
8
(a)
(5)
required
the
company
to
give
what
it
did
gives,
the
so-called
wealth
of
material?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
you
do
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
do
concede
that
8
(a)
(5)
required
it
as
much
as
you
did.
justice
potter
stewart
they
didn't
really
asked
for
definitions
that
they
were
multiple
choice
questions
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
fundamentally
inconsistent
position
that
you
described
the
union
is
taking.
if
the
union
begins
by
conceding
the
validity
and
reliability
of
these
tests,
which
are
after
all
aptitude
tests,
not
proficiency
test
and
their
aptitude
test
presumably
devised
by
people
who
know
what
they're
doing.
and
the
union
by
conceding
their
validity
and
reliability
concedes
as
much
then
how
possibly
is
it
consistent
for
the
union
to
take
the
position
yes,
but
in
some
cases
they're
invalid
and
unreliable.
and
where
do
you
stop
when
you
do
that,
the
company
concedes
and
everybody
--
the
experts
concede
that
there
are
80%
more
or
less
reliable
than
those
under
10.3,
20%
of
them
might
be
good
instrument
men.
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
all
conceded
but
that's
true
of
any
aptitude
test,
unless
you
get
a
10%,
i
mean
a
100%
correlation
factor.
justice
potter
stewart
which
requires
for
a
promotion
by
seniority
at
the
monroe
plant
except
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
of
measuring
the
head
and
shoulder
differences.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
union
concede
it's
valid
and
reliable?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
employer
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
who
were
between
9.3
and
10.3?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
company
hired
one
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
when
you
just
throw
out
the
test?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
that
that's
at
all
a
consistent
position.
how
can
one
concede
the
reliability
and
validity
of
a
test
and
then
say
and
yet
it
doesn't
show
anything.
because
there
a
lot
of
people
who
get
below
10.3
who
are
in
fact
qualified
that's
saying
the
test
is
unreliable
and
invalid.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
union
wasn't
--
the
object
of
the
--
for
this
where
the
union
wasn't
a
party
in
the
board
proceeding
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
order
didn't
run
against
the
union,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
condition
of
it
--
of
the
turn
over
to
the
union.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
--
if
i
were
representing
the
union
and
somebody
cited
me
in
contempt,
i
think
i'd
have
a
very
good
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
charging
party,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
it
does
--
well,
at
the
--
not
this
unit
of
the
union
which
is
only
the
monroe
plant,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
and
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
then
all
the
people
who
got
these
jobs
were
from
other
plants.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
imposed
upon
an
employer
by
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
includes
a
duty
to
provide
relevant
information
needed
by
a
labor
union
for
the
proper
performance
of
its
duties
as
the
employees
bargaining
representative.
this
is
apparently
the
first
case
in
which
the
board
has
held
that
an
employer's
duty
to
provide
relevant
information
to
the
employee's
bargaining
representative
includes
the
duty
to
disclose
directly
to
a
union
tests
and
test
scores
achieved
by
named
employees
in
a
statistically
validated
psychological
aptitude
testing
program
administered
by
the
employer.
psychological
aptitude
testing
is
a
widely
used
employee
selection
and
promotion
device
in
both
private
industry
and
government.
test
secrecy
is
concededly
critical
to
the
validity
of
any
such
program,
and
confidentiality
of
scores
is
undeniably
important
to
the
examinees.
the
underlying
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
board's
order
enforced
without
modification
by
the
court
of
appeals
adequately
accommodated
these
concerns.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
hold
that
the
board's
order
did
not
adequately
accommodate
these
interests.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
and
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
