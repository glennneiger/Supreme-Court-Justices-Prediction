justice
william

rehnquist
since
this
isn't
a
title
vii
case,
how
does
that
bear
on
your
argument
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
if
a
test
were
not
predictive
at
all,
you
would
feel
the
union
had
a
greater
right
of
access
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
puzzled
by
your
reliance
on
the
eeoc
guidelines
as
compared
with
the
board's
action
here
because
as
i
recall
the
eeoc
is
not
charged
by
law
with
making
interpretative
with
actually
filling
in
blanks
in
the
statute.
and
the
board,
i've
always
assumed
had
more
authority
than
in
its
adjudicatory
function
eeoc
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
we
refuse
to
follow
them
in
gilbert
versus
general
electric.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcguinn,
in
the
griggs
case
and
i
do
not
mean
to
delay
this
point
unduly,
where
you
in
your
brief
quoted
as
saying
that
eeoc
guidelines
are
to
be
regarded
as
expressing
the
will
of
congress
and
you
have
a
page
citation
to
griggs
at
401
u.s.433-434.
there
is
a
sentence
on
page
40
30
--
434
that
says
since
the
act
and
its
legislative
history
support
the
commission's
construction,
this
affords
a
good
reason
to
treat
the
guidelines
as
expressing
the
will
of
congress.
i
take
it
you
would
want
your
brief
qualified
in
the
same
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
come.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
company
before
the
board
take
the
position
that
the
administrative
law
judge's
order
was
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
have
no
reason
to
accept
to
the
--
his
proviso
that
it'd
be
turned
over
only
to
a
psychologist
and
since
that
favored
them
rather
disfavor
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
not
only
their
argument,
but
it's
rather
self-evident,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
can
see
how
you
--
the
union
could
take
that
position
if
it
hadn't
conceded
that
the
tests
were
relevant.
if
the
--
if
it
said
that
employer
is
using
this
test
as
a
ringer
to
really
promote
its
own
favorite
sons
or
daughters
but
the
union
as
i
take
it
is
conceded
that
the
test
do
have
bearing
and
are
permissible
to
use.
the
government
in
its
brief
says
so.-
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
has
had
a
historic
resistance
to
the
test
too,
hasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rather
than
seniority?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
into
the
extent
that
the
arbitrator
throws
out
the
company's
decision
to
promote
some
who
did
well
on
the
test
scores,
they
too
are
union
members,
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
10
(e)
certainly
provides
that
you
can
lose
your
legal
rights
in
certain
circumstances,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
thought
10
(e)
was
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
dealt
with
labor
relations
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
bound
by
the
statute
the
same
way
people
in
other
branches
of
the
law
are?
