but
that
wouldn't
compromise
the
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
had
--
they've
been
--
we've
never
said
that
the
eeoc
power
is
equivalent
to
a
--
a
pow
--
a
what
--
to
a
board
or
an
agency
that
has
power
to
issue
regulations.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
on
the
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
do
you
say
we
--
that
that
restriction
does
not
satisfy
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
could
rely
though
on
a
--
on
the
union's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
psychologist?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
we
must
assume
the
union
would
disobey
an
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
after
a
grievance
has
been
processed,
arbitrated,
the
union
just
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
claim
that
in
the
course
of
the
arbitration,
the
employer
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now
that's
a
perfectly
--
that's
--
the
board
has
a
jurisdiction
to
hear
that,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
request
--
all
that
--
what
they
want
adjudicated
is
that
the
employer
did
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
they
proceeded
--
the
request
was
made
in
the
course
of
a
--
and
refused
in
a
course
of
a
grievance
procedure
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
that
time,
the
union
thought
the
employer
was
breached
--
was
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
it
--
best
they
took
it
to
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
in
an
election,
in
a
union
election
campaign,
the
employer
threatens
some
workers,
“if
you
vote,
i'll
fire
you
or
something”.
in
any
event,
the
election
is
over,
the
union
wins
and
the
union
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
that
the
union
--
that
the
employer
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
will
it
just
be
dismissed
because
the
election
is
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
don't
want
the
information.
they
want
to
--
just
want
a
judgment
that
they
committed
an
unfair
practice
during
the
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
scores,
individual
scores?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
and
any
information
off
the
test
papers,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
do
you
think
it
would
violate
this
order
if
somebody
said
john
jones
got
a
minus
61?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so
any
information
off
the
papers
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
the
union
interpret
it?
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
the
case
isn't
over
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
at
the
behest
to
the
board,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
general
counsel,
the
general
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
company
has
to
ask
them
and
then
they
have
to
respond.
