mr.
mcguinn,
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
stewart's
question.
supposing
there
have
been
no
arbitration
at
all,
and
the
union
just
made
a
demand
out
of
the
blue
for
possible
future
use
in
connection
with
possible
arbitration,
would
you
have
an
8
(a)
(5)
obligation
to
comply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
once
the
arbitration
proceeding
was
over,
did
not
the
--
of
course
the
inquiry
become
academic?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
didn't
he
conclude
they
were
unnecessary
for
his
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
a
little
puzzled
as
to
whether
we
should
decide
the
case
on
the
theory
that
they're
needed
for
this
particular
arbitration
which
may
be
reopened
or
if
they're
needed
in
sort
of
a
general
way
for
future
use
and
bargaining
whatever
may
arise.
sort
of
to
--
yeah
that's
right,
the
police
compliance
with
the
agreement
of
the
future.
i'm
just
--
just
have
a
little
trouble
identifying
what
the
standard
of
reference
is
in
which
we're
supposed
to
judge
the
case
by.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
i
think
i'm
asking
for
a
clarification
of
your
answer
to
justice
stewart.
was
your
answer
predicated
on
a
relationship
to
the
arbitrator?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
come,
can
i
get
something
straight.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
give
the
example
of
the
vocabulary
multiple
choice
question
and
said
that
might
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
job.
i
don't
understood
you
to
imply
that
the
union
would
have
access
not
only
to
the
form
of
test,
the
actual
batteries,
but
to
the
answers
of
particular
employees.
now,
that
isn't
right,
isn't
it?
don't
they
just
get
the
scores
of
the
employees
and
then
the
form
of
the
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
would
not
know
which
questions
they
missed
and
which
they
got
correct,
would
they?
the
employees,
in
the
material
--
i
may
have
misunderstand
the
record
and
that's
really
i
guess
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
material
that
must
be
disclosed
is
--
does
it
include
the
actual
tests
that
the
employees
took
or
merely
their
scores
and
a
master
copy
of
the
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh
i
see.
i
misunderstood.
pardon
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
mcguinn.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
go
back
for
a
second,
why
couldn't
he
--
you
made
an
offer
and
they
turned
it
down.why
can't
you
withdraw
it
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why?
you
just
say,
although
we
--
you
say,
we're
happy
with
the
result.
we
want
to
preserve
our
record.
in
case
we
lose,
we'll
--
we
take
an
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
done
all
the
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
would
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
preserve
your
argument
here
today
if
you've
done
that,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
have
been
unambiguously
preserved
without
necessarily
raffling
its
feelings
in
it,
wouldn't
they?
