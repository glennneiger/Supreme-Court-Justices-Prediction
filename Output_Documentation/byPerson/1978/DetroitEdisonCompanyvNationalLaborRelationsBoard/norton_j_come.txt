mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
administrative
law
judge
whose
findings
were
adopted
by
the
board
found
that
the
information
requested
by
the
union,
the
test
questions
and
the
actual
test
papers
and
scores
of
the
employee
applicants
for
the
instrument
man
jobs
were
potentially
irrelevant
to
the
processing
of
the
grievances
which
have
been
filed
by
the
employees
who
had
been
denied
for
failing
to
attain
the
cutoff
score
on
the
test.
and
thus
under
the
principles
of
acme
industrial,
the
company
violated
its
bargaining
obligation
in
refusing
to
furnish
this
information
to
the
union.
now,
before
the
board,
the
company
did
not
accept
to
the
administrative
law
judge's
finding
that
the
test
questions
or
the
test
battery
and
the
test
papers
were
relevant
to
the
processing
of
the
pending
grievance.
indeed
it
all
urged
the
board
to
adopt
that
part
of
the
administrative
law
judge's
recommended
order
which
provided
that
the
tests
and
test
papers
be
turned
over
to
a
psychologist
selected
by
the
union
who
in
turn
would
make
them
available
to
the
union
and
let
it
use
them
to
the
extent
necessary
for
the
processing
of
the
grievances.
the
company
accepted
only
to
the
administrative
law
judge's
finding
that
the
union
needed
to
link
the
employees'
names
to
the
test
scores.
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit
and
under
section
10
(e)
of
the
act
which
precludes
judicial
review
of
contentions
that
were
not
raised
before
the
board,
judicial
review
the
question
of
the
relevance
of
the
test
battery
and
the
test
papers
is
foreclosed.
nor
may
the
company
avoid
this
foreclosure
by
arguing
as
it
does
in
its
brief
that
it
had
no
practical
reason
to
challenge
the
aoj's
order
because
it
had
earlier
offered
voluntarily
to
turn
over
this
information
to
appease
the
union.
the
union's
cross
exceptions
put
the
company
on
notice
that
the
portion
of
the
order
which
it
was
willing
to
accept
was
subject
to
reexamination
by
the
board.
and
we
submit
that
if
the
company
had
any
question
as
to
relevancy
of
that
information
that
was
the
time
it
should
have
urged
that
at
least
as
an
alternative
contention
before
the
board.
accordingly,
as
we
see
it
and
as
the
court
below
sought,
the
basic
question
really
presented
here
is
whether
the
board
reasonably
exercised
the
broad
remedial
authority
that
it
has
under
section
10
(e)
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
in
two
places
in
its
exceptions
which
we
have
lodged
with
the
clerk,
they
urged
and
the
word
urge
is
theirs,
the
board
to
adopt
that
part
of
the
administrative
law
judge's
recommended
order.
they
accepted
only
to
his
recommendations
insofar
as
it
required
that
the
test
scores
linked
to
employee
names
be
turned
over.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
their
argument.
however,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
however,
when
the
union
cross
accepted
to
that
part
of
the
order,
it
is
our
contention
that
that
put
the
company
unnoticed
that
they
would
--
might
lose
even
that
part
of
the
order
and
therefore,
in
order
to
protect
themselves,
they
should
have
raised
what
the
board,
at
least
the
alternative
contention
that
we
don't
think
that
we
committed
any
unfair
labor
practice
here
to
begin
with.
but
they
never
raised
that
before
the
board
nor
did
they
do
so
in
their
petition
for
reconsideration
after
the
board
came
down
with
its
decision.
now,
they
say
the
basic
question
as
we
see
it
is
whether
the
board
was
reasonable
in
ordering
the
company
to
furnish
to
the
union
directly
rather
than
to
a
union
selected
psychologist.
these
test
materials
where
the
board
order
includes
protective
provisions
to
maintain
test
security.
now,
the
purposes
for
which
the
union
intended
to
use
the
test
materials
did
not
necessarily
require
the
aide
of
a
qualified
psychologist.
the
union
was
not
challenging
the
company's
showing
that
there
was
a
high
statistical
probability
that
those
applicants
who
did
well
on
the
test
would
do
well
in
the
instrument
man
job.
for
that,
presumably,
you
might
need
a
trained
psychologist.
rather
the
union
was
attempting
to
show
that
the
test
were
nonetheless
unfair
to
certain
applicants
who
although
they
did
poorly
on
the
test,
had
the
--
nonetheless
had
the
ability
to
perform
the
job.
the
company
acknowledges
in
its
brief
that
those
scoring
less
than
10.3
which
was
its
cutoff
point
had
at
least
the
20%
chance
of
becoming
successful
instrument
man
--
men
and
the
union
was
attempting
to
show
that
some
of
the
low
scorers
were
in
this
category.
for
example,
the
vocabulary
sample
of
the
section
of
the
sample
test
and
these
weren't
the
exact
questions
because
the
company
only
submitted
a
partial
sample,
asked
for
definitions
of
words
like
homage,
diabolic,
impugn,
and
draw.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
they
wanted
to
know
if
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
they
could
recognize
what
that
word
meant.
mr.
norton
j.
come
or
what
they
did
not
mean.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
helps
if
you
do.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
now,
if
the
union
could
show
for
example
that
the
instrument
man
job
did
not
require
a
knowledge
of
such
items
and
that
employee
smith
who
had
past
experience
in
other
jobs
that
were
very
closely
related
to
the
instrument
man
job
where
he
had
gotten
uniformly
high
marks
on,
scored
less
than
10.3
simply
because
he
missed
these
kinds
of
questions
rather
than
those
that
were
more
job
related.
it
would
have
a
substantial
basis
for
arguing
to
the
arbitrator
that
smith
should
not
have
been
disqualified
for
the
job
merely
before
--
because
he
failed
to
meet
the
10.3
cutoff
score.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
under
the
contract
that
was
negotiated
in
which
the
union
as
the
representative
of
the
employees
has
a
duty
to
see
that
it
has
thoroughly
administered
the
con
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
where
there
are
head
and
shoulder
differences
among
the
applicants.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now
the
cast
was
a
statistical
major
of
trying
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
but
it
was
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
--
but
they
are
not
conceding
that
the
test
will
be
100%
accurate
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
nor
is
the
company
conceding
that
the
test
is
a
100%
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
there
in
lies
the
basis
for
a
grievance.
even
the
arbitrator
on
the
basis
of
the
fragmentary
materials
that
he
had
found
that
there
were
at
last
employees
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
who
should
have
been
reexamined
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
and
on
reexamining
them,
the
company
found
that
the
qualifications
of
at
least
of
one
of
them
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
was
sufficient
to
override
his
low
score
on
the
test.
now
the
union
as
the
statutory
representative
of
the
employees
we
submit
had
a
statutory
obligation,
indeed
a
duty
to
fairly
represent
these
employees
to
ensure
that
any
employee
who
had
the
qualifications
for
the
job
would
at
least
have
an
opportunity
to
be
considered
even
though
he
happen
to
be
a
poor
tester
as
some
of
us
are.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
all
that
the
validity
or
the
test
shows
that
it
has
a
statistical
probability
that
they
are
still
going
to
be
employees
who
would
--
could
be
shown
are
capable
of
performing
their
job
notwithstanding
their
showing
on
the
test.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
because
our
basic
position
is
that
the
company
is
not
conceding
--
has
not
accepted
that
the
union's
right
to
this
information
as
to
--
is
merely
to
show
that
why
the
board
in
framing
the
kind
of
order
that
it
framed
did
not
require
the
union
to
go
to
the
expense
of
necessarily
hiring
a
union
psychologist.
the
use
that
the
union
wanted
to
make
of
the
test
didn't
require
that.
and
intelligent
layman,
someone
who
had
familiarity
with
the
operations
of
a
power
plant,
an
engineer
might
have
been
more
help
to
the
union
than
would
have
been
a
professional
psychologist.
now,
i
want
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
they
need
to
know
the
names
of
the
employees
and
link
them
to
the
scores.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
there
are
actual
test
papers
as
well.
mr.
norton
j.
come
so
that
the
union
could
have
the
whole
--
without
the
whole
picture
you
would
not
know
whether
x
scored
low
because
he
missed
the
physical
science
and
mathematical
questions
that
were
germane
to
the
instrument
man
job
or
not.
you
also
would
not
be
able
to
know
whether
there
was
any
systematic
bias
in
these
tests.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
as
the
administrative
law
judge
pointed
out
in
his
report
on
page
47a
of
the
appendix
to
the
position
--
to
the
petition.
there
is
a
difference
between
the
statistical
validity
of
the
test
and
the
purpose
for
which
the
union
--
this
information
was
relevant
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
as
the
examiner
--
as
the
law
judge
pointed
out
and
i
don't
want
to
read
all
of
it,
statistical
unrelated
data
which
are
available
to
the
union
are
sufficient
to
prove
the
validity
of
the
psychological
test
for
the
purpose
used.
the
statistics
may
indeed
tend
to
show
that
the
tests
are
valid
to
serve
the
employer's
purpose.
they
may
serve
to
identify
those
employees
likely
to
do
well
on
the
job.
however,
the
statistics
do
not
serve
to
inform
the
employees
or
the
representatives
whether
the
tests
are
truly
job
related
or
contain
objectionable
distortions,
whether
in
some
they
tend
to
undercut
respondent's
contract
commitment
to
promote
by
seniority,
whether
there's
no
significant
difference.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
a
crucial
difference
between
the
statistical
validity
of
the
test
and
whether
or
not
an
individual
employee
nonetheless
has
a
substantial
basis
for
grieving
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
that
does
happen
with
respect
to
decisions
of
this
court
and
also
with
respect
to
drawing
legislation
but
i
submit
however
that
processing
individual
employee
difference
--
grievances
under
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
allows
for
more
than
just
a
general
line.
that's
the
purpose
of
having
a
grievance
procedure
and
the
right
of
individual
employees
to
file
grievances.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
individual
has
a
right
under
these
procedures
we
submit
to
show
that
his
case
should
not
be
covered
by
the
general
law.
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh,
because
the
test
is
a
tool.
it
is
a
valuable
tool.
but
it
is
not
the
be
all
and
the
end
all.
now,
with
respect
to
the
board's
order
here,
it
--
the
argument
is
made
that
--
well,
it
looks
only
after
the
interest
of
the
union.
it
does
not
protect
other
important
interest,
namely
the
company's
interest
in
maintaining
test
security.
now,
and
we
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
as
the
court
of
appeals
enforcing
the
board's
order
stated
is
that
the
restrictions
on
use
of
the
materials
and
the
obligation
to
return
them
to
the
company
which
the
court
enforced.
in
other
words,
the
protective
order
adequately
protects
the
company's
interest
in
test
security.
now,
the
board's
order
accords
the
union
the
right
to
see
and
study
the
test
and
they
use
the
test
and
information
contained
therein
to
the
extent
necessary
to
process
and
arbitrate
the
grievances.
however,
the
union
is
directed
not
to
copy
the
test
or
otherwise
use
them
for
the
purpose
of
disclosing
the
test
or
the
questions
to
employees
who
in
the
past
or
who
may
in
the
future
take
these
tests
or
to
anyone
other
than
the
arbitrator.
and
after
the
conclusion
of
the
arbitration
proceeding,
the
union
is
retire
--
is
required
to
return
all
copies
to
the
company.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
as
we
read
the
terms
of
the
protective
order
which
are
set
forth
on
page
55a,
when
the
board
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
of
the
appendix.
in
the
remedy
section.
mr.
norton
j.
come
appendix
to
the
petitioner.
it
says
the
respondent
has
directed
to
supply
copies
of
the
battery
of
tests
administered
to
the
employee
applicants
including
the
actual
test
papers
of
the
applicants,
and
then
the
word
“test”
is
used
thereafter.
as
we
read
it,
we
believe
that
the
board
was
using
the
administrative
law
judge
using
the
word
“test”
in
the
generic
sense
to
include
not
only
the
battery
of
tests
namely
the
test
questions
but
also
the
actual
test
papers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
think
that
there
would
but
--
that
it
would
because
the
union
show
--
except
in
connection
with
the
arbitration
proceeding.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
i
interpret
the
order.
now,
some
argument
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
know
how
they
interpret
it
but
i'd
be
surprised
if
they
did
interpret
it
any
differently.
i
think
that
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
way
these
words
were
used.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
terms
of
the
protective
order
could
not
be
improved
upon
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight.
but
these
are
similar,
the
kinds
of
protective
orders
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
the
case
is
not
over.
the
case
is
not
over.
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
federal
courts
quite
regularly
enter
protective
orders
of
this
sort
in
ordering
disclosure
of
a
sensitive
information
per
under
the
federal
discovery
rules.
now,
and
the
union
would
be
subject
to
a
contempt
citation
where
it
--
to
violate
the
terms
of
this
protective
order.
now,
just
as
an
individual
bound
by
a
protective
order
in
a
discovery
proceeding
would
be.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
would
be
at
the
behest
of
the
board
but
there's
no
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
must
bring
the
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
but
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
board
which
is
interested
in
seeing
that
its
orders
as
enforced
by
the
court
of
appeals
are
not
flouted
would
not
be
very
alert
to
checking
any
contempt
there
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
did
not
run
against
it
except
insofar
as
of
the
terms
on
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
i
don't
think
that
you
would
prevail
for
this
reason
your
honor.
the
union
was
a
party
to
the
board
proceeding
and
actively
participated
in
the
litigation
over
its
right
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
to
obtain
the
test
materials
and
the
conditions
under
which
they
could
be
obtained.
now
it
had
a
right
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
objected
to
those
conditions.instead,
it
did
not
do
so.
it
elected
to
permit
the
board
to
enforce
the
order
with
these
conditions
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit
that
the
union
is
--
stopped
to
challenge
the
restrictions
on
the
use
of
the
materials.
and
if
it
were
to
accept
the
test
materials
under
the
terms
of
the
board's
order
as
enforced
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
would
be
bound
by
those
restrictions
and
subject
to
a
contempt
citation.
beyond
that,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
there
are
important
institutional
reasons
why
it
cannot
be
assumed
as
the
company
does
that
the
union
would
be
breaching
the
security
of
these
test
materials.
the
union
has
had
a
bargaining
relationship
with
this
company
for
over
28
years.
it
has
been
certified
in
about
28
bargaining
units.
it
would
certainly
be
very,
very
short
sighted
on
its
part
were
it
to
jeopardize
its
long
standing
relationship
and
its
continuing
relationship
with
this
company
to
misuse
these
test
materials.
moreover,
it
would
jeopardize
its
position
with
the
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
all
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
all
that
the
record
shows
on
that
is
that
it
attempted
to
obtain
in
the
contract
a
provision
that
would
make
seniority
the
sole
governance
for
promotions.
but
having
lost
on
that,
there
is
no
basis
for
assuming
that
it's
going
to
go
around
and
broadcast
these
test
materials.
it
represents
even
the
employees
who
scored
high
on
this
test
and
if
these
tests
should
be
thrown
out
in
their
promotions
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
does
represent
the
monroe
plant.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
when
they
came
into
this
bargaining
unit,
they'd
be
represented
by
this
unit
--
union.
the
union
must
represent
fairly
all
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
test
would
assist
it
in
this
sense.
you
start
with
the
fact
that
the
test
do
have
a
statistical
validity.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
i
think
that
the
union
rather
than
just
willy-nilly
attempting
to
show
that
the
employee
was
capable
of
doing
the
job
wanted
also
to
see
what
were
the
types
of
questions
that
he
missed
on
the
test.
now
if
you
could
show
that
smith
with
a
good
record
missed
the
kind
of
questions
that
i
was
using
for
illustration
purposes,
but
did
very
well
on
all
the
mathematical
and
physical
science
questions
that
were
more
germane
to
the
instrument
man
job,
it
would
have
a
better
case
before
the
arbitrator
than
if
it
merely
had
a
situation
where
it
could've
been
that
the
reason
that
smith
did
poorly
was
because
he
missed
the
mathematical
questions
and
the
physical
science
questions.
i
think
that
the
types
of
questions
that
the
employee
missed
would
be
very
relevant
and
--
to
the
union
and
helpful
to
it
in
prosecuting
or
persuading
the
arbitrator
that
notwithstanding
the
showing
on
the
test
the
employee
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
these
men
were
not
instrument
--
formerly
instrument
men
so
you
had
to
take
analogous
job
skills
and
in
making
that
showing,
i
submit
that
where
he
failed
on
or
--
on
the
test
would
be
helpful
in
that
regard.
