chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
968,
detroit
edison
company
against
the
labor
board.
mr.
mcguinn,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
wouldn't
want
the
general
disclosure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
detroit
edison
object
to
the
disclosure
to
--
what
was
sorted
by
the
hearing
examiner
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock
mr.
mcguinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcguinn,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
an
hour
has
elapsed,
let
mr.
justice
white
try
it
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
what
they
did
not
mean.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
multiple
choice
test,
you
don't
need
to
know
all
the
meaning
of
all
the
words.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
yes
it
does
but
you
--
if
you
know
the
range
you're
in.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
asking
for
a
perfect
test
and
that's
impossible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
more
could
the
company
do
than
reexamine
the
three
that
were
raised
and
when
they
make
a
judgment,
it
isn't
necessarily
a
judgment
that
they
were
wrong
in
the
first
time
but
they
were
willing
on
marginal
case
to
take
a
chance.
does
it
mean
any
more
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
know
and
the
testing
field
generally
but
that's
true.
there
are
people
who
pass
bar
examinations
who
never
will
make
lawyers
and
there
are
people
who
fail
who
might
make
pretty
good
lawyers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come,
once
you
have
conceded,
once
everyone
agrees
as
they
apparently
do
here
that
these
tests
are
valid,
that
they
have
an
objective
purpose
and
they're
fulfilling
that
purpose.
is
this
fundamentally
different
from
any
line
drawing
process
in
which
in
many
decisions
this
court
has
said
when
there's
a
line
drawing
process,
it
will
inevitably
include
some
people
who
should
be
excluded
and
excluded
some
people
who
should
be
included.
now
that
happens
here,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
individual
appeals
of
each
case
which
is
what
this
surmounts
to
then
why
not
just
scrap
the
whole
testing
process
what
the
employer
make
his
management
decisions
that
the
union
got
--
have
a
grievance
on
anyone
that
he
does
--
they
don't
like.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
what,
of
the?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
mr.
come.
thank
you.
mr.
mcguinn,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
968,
detroit
edison
company
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.

justice

you
