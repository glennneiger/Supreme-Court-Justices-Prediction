mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
mr.
chief
justice
and
then
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
in
this
case
may
be
stated
as
follows.
does
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
deprive
the
disinterested
directors
of
the
mutual
fund
of
their
power
to
terminate
a
stockholders'
derivate
action,
which
those
directors
in
good
faith
have
concluded
is
contrary
to
the
best
interests
of
the
fund
and
its
shareholders?
the
district
court
held
that
the
disinterested
directors
in
the
exercise
of
their
good
faith
business
judgment
have
the
power
to
terminate
such
an
action.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
directors
have
no
such
power
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
they
acted
in
good
faith.
certain
subsidiary
issues
are
also
raised
in
this
case
and
they
will
emerge
in
my
later
discussion
of
the
plaintiffs
point
in
this
case.
the
facts
are
set
forth
chronologically
in
our
main
brief,
the
white
covered
brief
that
pages
4
through
19.
in
the
interest
of
moving
promptly
to
the
central
legal
issue
in
this
case
i
will
simply
summarize
the
highlights
at
this
point.
in
november
1969,
fundamental
investors,
the
mutual
fund
involved
in
this
case,
purchased
$20
million
of
the
commercial
paper
of
penn
central.
the
commercial
paper
of
penn
central
was
rated,
prime,
the
highest
rating
by
nco,
a
subsidiary
of
dun
&
bradstreet
which
is
the
foremost
independent
rating
agency
in
the
united
states.
in
june
1970,
penn
central
filed
for
reorganization
and
defaulted
on
the
notes.
numerous
people
were
caught
in
the
default
as
well
as
fundamental
investors,
banks,
trust
companies,
charities,
universities
many
other
sophisticated
and
able
investors.
in
november
1970,
the
board
of
directors
of
fundamental
authorized
a
lawsuit
against
goldman
sachs,
the
dealer
which
had
sold
the
paper.
that
suit
proceeded
vigorously
for
several
years
as
part
of
a
multi-district
proceeding.
in
february
1973,
three
years
after
the
purchase,
two
stockholders
holding
very
minimal
shares
filed
a
derivate
action
against
anchor
corporation,
the
investment
advisor
to
fundamental,
and
against
the
directors
of
fundamental
at
the
time
of
the
purchase,
that
is
to
say
the
1969
directors.
that
action
was
stayed
by
judge
gurfein,
pending
resolution
of
the
claims
of
fundamental
investors
against
goldman
sachs.
in
july
1974,
on
the
eve
of
trail
of
the
action
between
fundamental
and
goldman
sachs
there
was
a
settlement
pursuant
on
to
which
fundamental
was
paid
five
million
two
hundred
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
cash
and
also
the
balance
of
their
claim
in
the
notes
of
penn
central
and
reorganization.
the
board
of
directors
--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
the
exact
value
is
not
a
matter
of
record,
your
honor.
however,
i
believe
that
the
card
indication
is
that
the
additional
paper
may
be
worth
as
much
as
$3
million
or
$4
million.
the
board
of
directors
of
fundamental
promptly
convened
and
determined
that
it
would
review
the
lasker
action,
that
is
to
say
the
derivative
action,
and
that
the
five
disinterested
directors
among
them
who
were
not
defendants
in
the
lasker
action,
who
had
not
been
directors
at
the
time
of
purchase
and
who
were
not
affiliated
in
any
way
with
anchor,
would
constituting
quorum,
determine
what
posture
the
fund
should
take
with
respect
to
that
action.
those
five
disinterested
directors
there
upon
retained
independent
special
counsel,
former
chief
judge
of
the
state
of
new
york,
stanley
h.
fuld
and
they
instructed
him
to
prepare
a
comprehensive
memorandum
and
report
on
the
subject.
judge
fuld
studied
the
matter
for
several
months
and
in
december
issued
a
report
to
the
disinterested
directors,
in
which
he
concluded
that
neither
anchor
nor
any
of
the
fund
directors
had
violated
any
law
or
any
contractual
or
other
obligation
to
fundamental
investors.
the
disinterested
directors
then
deliberated
the
matter
among
themselves
in
a
serious
of
special
meetings.
they
interrogated
people
in
the
fund,
they
interrogated
people
from
anchor,
they
questioned
judge
fuld,
they
communicated
extensively
and
among
themselves
they
had
no
contact
with
anyone
from
anchor.
in
early
january
1975,
those
five
disinterested
directors
put
the
matter
to
a
vote
and
unanimously
determined
that
the
maintenance
of
these
derivative
action
against
the
advisor
and
the
directors
was
contrary
to
the
best
interests
of
the
fund
and
they
determined
that
they
would
move
to
dismiss
the
suit.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed.
judge
walker
said
that
the
disinterested
directors
acting
for
the
board
had
the
power
to
determine
in
the
good
faith
exercise
of
their
business
judgment,
that
this
suit
should
be
terminated.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
it
was
mr.
chief
justice
and
in
that
respect
the
plaintiffs
at
the
time
of
motion
to
dismiss
before
judge
walker,
questioned
the
independence
of
these
interested
directors
and
judge
walker
promptly
ordered
discovery
on
the
subject.
there
was
extensive
discovery,
spanning
several
months.
over
thousand
pages
of
testimony
was
taken.
there
were
several
document
productions.
the
motion
was
then
renewed
and
judge
walker
found
that
there
was
no
basis,
no
factual
basis
to
question
the
independence
of
these
directors
and
he
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss.
thereafter
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
they
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
irrespective
of
whether
the
directors
had
acted
in
good
faith,
they
were
deprived
by
the
investment
company
act
of
the
power
to
make
such
a
decision
on
behalf
of
the
fund.
in
effect,
the
court
of
appeals,
although
it
didn’t
use
these
words,
said
that
the
disinterested
directors
couldn’t
be
trusted.
i
turn
to
the
legal
analysis
at
this
point.
the
starting
point
of
the
legal
analysis
is
delaware
corporation
law,
section
141a.
the
court
will
find
that
reproduced
in
the
addendum
to
our
main
brief,
the
white
covered
brief.
the
language
of
141a
says
just
this
“the
business
and
affairs
of
every
corporation
organized
under
this
chapter
shall
be
managed
by
or
under
the
direction
of
a
board
of
directors.”
fundamental
is
a
delaware
corporation.
it
fits
squarely
within
that
provision
and
we
believe
that
the
directors
of
fundamental
as
a
delaware
corporation
had
and
have
the
power
to
mange
the
affairs
of
the
corporation.
this
court
has
long
held
in
a
line
of
cases
is
going
back
75
to
100
years
that
that
power
includes
the
power
to
determine
whether
or
not
claims
shall
be
prosecuted
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
this
court
in
the
corbus
and
united
copper
cases
which
are
the
two
seminal
cases
following
(inaudible)
said
as
follows
and
i
quote
two
sentences
from
corbus
“a
court
of
equity
may
not
me
called
upon
at
the
appeal
of
any
single
stockholder
to
compel
the
directors
of
the
corporation
to
enforce
every
right
which
it
may
posses,
irrespective
of
other
considerations.
it
is
not
a
trifling
thing
for
a
stockholder
to
attempt
to
coerce
the
directors
of
a
corporation
to
act
which
their
judgment
does
not
approve
or
to
substitute
his
judgment
for
theirs.”
and
that
states
the
business
judgment
rule
as
it
as
been
enunciated
by
this
court.
we
turn
to
the
second
point
on
the
legal
analysis.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
arguably
that
is
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
arguably
that
is
so
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
that
does
not
deal
with
the
case
such
as
here
where
there
is
a
quorum
that
can
pass
on
the
matter.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
pass
on
that
one
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
no
i’m
suggesting
that
that
is
the
rule
of
this
court
which
has
been
applied
through
the
years
and
has
guarded
the
interpretation
in
lower
courts.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
this
court
was
faced
with
the
question,
it
is
a
pre-early
case
agreed,
but
it
was
faced
with
a
question
as
to
the
powers
of
directors
as
a
matter
of
general
corporate
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
with
the
united
states
your
honor?
we
agree
with
some
aspects
of
their
brief
insofar
as
they
say
that
the
investment
company
act
is
the
source
of
power
and
governs
--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
we
do
not
agree.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
we
can
well
understand
the
argument
for
a
federal
rule
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
our
first
choice
and
the
logical
point
of
departure
is
that
this
is
matter
of
state
law
and
we
hold
to
that
proposition.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
no,
that
is
not
so
mr.
justice
white.
what
i
say
is
that
as
a
principle
or
starting
point
we
say
the
state
law
governs.
however,
we
recognize
that
under
the
investment
company
act
this
court
could
say
that
the
policies
of
the
act
are
so
important
that
it
will
be
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
the
states
for
regulatory
purposes.
i
recognize
that
that
is
the
first
of
foot
note
11
by
your
honor
in
the
santa
fe
opinion
and
we
are
content
to
live
with
the
either
side
of
that
equation.
we
think
the
more
orderly
way
to
decide
it
is
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
however,
we
are
also
willing
to
have
the
matter
decided
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
within
the
policies
of
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
that
is
exactly
my
argument
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
that
is
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
well
i
think.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
our
first
preference
is
united
state
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
correct
but
we
believe
that
even
under
their
argument
--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--
we
come
out
the
same
way
that
directors
do
have
the
power
under
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
the
disinterested
directors,
absolutely
your
honor.
i
turn
now
to
the
point
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
starting
point
was
delaware
law.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
--
under
the
investment
company
act
the
disinterested
directors
were
deprived
of
their
power.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
misconstruction
of
the
act,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
the
cases
under
the
act.
as
regards
the
act
itself
first,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
nowhere
does
it
expressly
preferred
to
remove
this
power
from
the
disinterested
directors.
next
i
point
out
as
the
sec
has
said
in
its
brief,
that
when
congress
meant
to
remove
such
power
it
did
so
expressly,
for
example
in
section
36
b.
further
more
a
reading
of
the
act
and
its
structure
indicates
clearly
that
congress
placed
great
trust
in
this
people
and
did
not
have
the
same
jaundice
view
of
the
disinterested
directors
that
was
held
by
the
court
of
appeals
here.
section
10
provides
that
40%
of
all
directors
of
mutual
fund
must
be
disinterested.
section
15
provides
that
these
are
the
directors,
these
disinterested
directors
who
must
pass
upon
and
approve
the
very
sensitive
issue
of
the
contract,
the
advisory
contract
between
the
fund
and
the
advisor.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
would
have
vested
that
power
in
the
directors
had
they
believed
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
that
they
were
not
to
be
trusted.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
don’t
have
the
answer
to
that
immediately
your
honor.
i
believe
to
that
proceeded
it,
but
the
disinterested
director
category
came
in
the
1970
amendment.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
correct
and
i
believe
that
the
40%
requirement
preceded
the
1970
amendments
i
would
–
that
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
that
is
correct
your
honor
that
is
correct
none
of
these
five
are
on
the
board
of
that
time.
one
came
on
a
1971,
one
in
1972,
and
two
1973
and
one
in
1974.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
no
question
your
honor
that
they
meet
not
only
that
the
statuary
definition
--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--
judge
walker
did
in
fact
find
that
they
were
disinterested.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
i
have
addressed
myself
to
the
act.
i
pass
now
to
the
legislative
of
history.
in
the
1970
amendments,
congress
added
a
new
section
to
a19
in
that
section
which
created
the
new
category
of
disinterested
directors
they
sought
to
remedy
the
criticism
of
the
prior
category
of
unaffiliated
directors.
and
they
filtered
the
new
definition
of
the
disinterested
directors
which
was
a
far
most
stringent
one
to
qualify
through
the
act
in
section
10,
section
15,
section
32.
we
believe
as
the
senate
report
91
184
shows
and
we
have
quoted
that
in
our
brief
that
congress
believed
that
in
so
doing
it
had
created
the
necessary
simuse
in
these
directors
to
fulfill
the
functions
of
passing
on
matters
that
involved
the
advisor.
finally
the
cases
under
the
act.
there
are
three
cases
which
we
believe
to
be
relevant.
we
recognized
that
they
are
in
some
respects
distinguishable.
tannenbaum,
fogo
and
kaufman,
the
logic
of
them
is
not
distinguishable.
in
each
of
those
three
cases
the
court
of
appeals
in
two
cases
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
one
case
for
the
first
circuit
clearly
indicate
that
there
is
a
business
judgment
rule
applicable
to
mutual
funds.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
have
come
up
with
a
single
case
or
that
the
court
of
appeals
came
up
with
the
single
case
which
shows
in
any
way
that
the
investment
company
act
deprived
the
disinterested
directors
of
there
business
judgment
powers.
in
that
regard
we
are
pleased
of
course
by
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
because
the
sec
in
a
rare
display
of
support
for
the
defendant
has
said
as
its
central
thesis
and
supporting
our
central
thesis
of
power
in
the
disinterested
directors
here
and
i
quote
from
there
brief,
“although
congress
could
have
prohibited
the
disinterested
directors
from
exercising
business
judgment
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
did
not
do
so.”
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
that’s
from
the
sec
brief
at
page
21
your
honor.
so
the
sec
thus
supports
the
fundamental
premise
on
which
our
position
is
based.
not
only
that
they
go
on
to
recognize
which
that
which
is
the
fact
and
that
is
that
the
business
judgment
rule
is
itself
an
important
shareholder
protection
device.
the
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
would
wipe
that
away
in
a
context
to
mutual
funds.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
mr.
justice
stewart
the
sec
has
a
three-prong
test.
the
directors
have
to
be
independent.
they
have
to
be
informed
and
the
judgment
must
be
reasonable.
they
acknowledge
in
there
brief
i
believe
that
the
first
two
prongs
of
the
test
are
meet
--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
correct
and
i
would
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
reasonableness.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
believe
that
classically
under
the
business
judgment
rule
as
it
has
been
formulated
in
the
cases
in
this
court
that
is
so.
we
do
believe
however
that
even
if
the
sec
tests
were
to
be
adopted
that
we
meet
that
test.
we
believe
that
as
to
reasonableness
that’s
perfectly
implicit.
judge
walker
would
not
have
dismissed
this
case
we
believe
if
he
believed
that
the
decision
was
unreasonable.
further
more
--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
mr.
justice
stewart
arguably,
arguably
that
is
so,
but
i
would
call
your
honor’s
attention
to
the
kramer
case
where
they
formulated
a
little
differently
from
the
sec.
they
say
that
the
judgment
must
be
made
in
exercise
of
--
business
judgment
must
be
made
in
good
faith.
implicit
in
that
is
that
they
be
independent
and
informed
and
that
the
judgment
not
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
fall
outside
the
bounds
of
sound
discretion,
in
other
words
they
speak
in
effect
of
a
zone
of
reasonableness
or
the
bounds
of
soundness
--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
judge
walker
also
did
point
out
in
his
opinion
expressly
that
he
found
that
this
was
a
reasoned
decision.
in
footnote
16
of
their
brief
the
sec
equates
a
reasoned
determination
with
reasonableness.
i
think
that
before
i
sit
down
for
this
at
this
point
in
time
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
two
subsidy
area
issues
raised
by
the
plaintiffs.
they
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
a
minority
of
the
full
board
can
take
this
action.
we
believe
that
has
no
legal
force.
the
question
is,
is
there
a
quorum.
section
141a
of
delaware
law
is
quite
clear
on
the
subject
that
a
quorum,
albeit
a
minority
of
the
board,
has
the
power
to
transact
the
business
of
the
corporation.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
pondered
that
very
analogy
your
honor
under
28
u.s.c
1,
which
i
reviewed
the
other
evening.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
and
i
think
perhaps
mr.
justice
marshall
did
put
his
finger
on
it.
the
difference
is
while
it
is
a
minority
of
the
full
board
that’s
acting;
the
quorum
itself
in
the
case
of
the
court
cannot
be
a
minority
because
i
believe
your
quorum
will
be
six,
out
of
nine.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes
it
is
your
honor,
but
if
the
quorum
--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
absolutely,
no
question
about
that
your
honor
and
the
concept
of
quorum
is
embedded
in
corporate
law
in
this
county
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
delaware
law
141
a,
i
believe
provides
that
a
quorum
can
transact
the
business
of
the
board
and
it
may
be
a
minority.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
up
to
one
it
can
be
as
little
as
one
third
if
the
by
laws
so
permit
and
in
the
case
of
fundamental
the
by
laws
had
a
one
third
quorum.
so
that
four
of
the
eleven
--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
exactly
actually
the
five
here
where
more
than
a
quorum,
four
would
have
been
a
quorum,
five
actually
acted.
the
other
point
that
i
wish
to
address
before
i
sit
down
at
this
point
is
their
concept
that
once
a
derivative
action
is
validly
commenced
under
rule
23.1,
it
can
never
be
terminated.
in
effect
what
they
say
is
if
you
put
the
key
in
the
lock,
it’s
once
and
you
once
get
the
door
open,
you
throw
away
the
key.
obviously
that
makes
no
sense
at
all
because
the
directors
are
the
ones
charged
with
the
oversight
of
the
business
of
the
corporation
and
they
must
have
continuing
power
to
review
the
matters
of
the
corporation
and
determine
on
a
continuing
basis
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
corporation.
we
believe
that
the
demand
requirement
is
a
procedural
requirement
which
speaks
only
as
of
the
time
of
the
institution
of
the
suit.
it
does
not
and
cannot
for
evermore
strict
the
directors
of
their
power
to
act
for
the
corporation
and
vest
control
of
the
corporate
destiny
in
a
single
stockholder.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
mr.
chief
justice,
and
again
may
it
please
the
court.
rule
23.1
as
relied
on
by
mr.
einstein
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
it
involves
settlements
by
plaintiffs
and
the
vice
sought
to
be
eradicated
there
is
collusive
settlements
where
a
plaintiff
drops
a
suit.
this
is
not
a
case
of
an
involuntary
dismissal.
this
is
a
case
where
the
matter
was
litigated
on
the
merits
before
judge
walker
and
he
dismissed
the
case
on
an
involuntary
basis.
i
want
bring
the
--
respectfully
bring
the
attention
of
the
court
back
to
the
central
issue
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
as
a
matter
of
a
law
disinterested
directors
had
no
power
to
terminate
this
stockholders'
derivative
action.
i’ve
listened
carefully
to
the
discussion
this
morning
and
i
believe
the
briefs
also
support
the
proposition
that
no
one
has
cited
any
authority
indicating
that
the
act
expressly
deprives
this
power
from
the
directors,
that
the
history
of
the
act
deprives
the
directors
of
this
power
or
that
the
relevant
case
law
under
the
act
deprives
the
directors
of
this
power.
mr.
ferrara
has
indicated
in
his
brief
for
the
government
that
the
sec
supports
the
notion
that
the
directors
have
the
power
and
that
the
power
has
not
been
withdrawn
by
the
act
or
what
he
says
is
that
there
should
be
a
remand,
but
i
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
final
footnote
and
the
brief
of
the
commission.
i
believe
the
microphone
may
have
gone
off
again.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
21;
footnote
21
says
although
we
suggest
a
remand,
this
court
could
determine
reasonableness
if
it
wishes
because
that
determination
involves
only
the
application
of
a
legal
standard
to
a
documentary
record.
now,
if
this
court
can
determine
reasonableness
from
this
record,
surely
judge
walker
could
and
we
argue
implicitly
did
make
a
finding
of
reasonableness,
if
this
court
should
find
that,
that
is
necessary.
therefore
we’ll
comeback
to
the
proposition
that
although
we
believe
that
state
law
governs
and
that
is
the
test
to
be
applied,
that
is
to
say
the
test
of
good
faith,
no
matter
which
of
the
tests
that
have
been
proposed
here
we
believe
that
we
meet
that
test.
judge
walker
found
and
i
cite
this
to
the
court
at
836
that
the
minority
directors
carefully
evaluated
the
opinions
tendered
by
both
counsels.
they
considered
the
merits,
they
discussed
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
purchase
and
retention
of
the
paper
and
they
communicated
extensively
among
themselves
before
reaching
a
decision
to
seek
dismissal
of
this
suit.
i
believe
that
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
directorial
conduct
that
one
wishes
to
encourage.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
time.
