mr.
ferrara
there
are
so
many
statutory
provisions
i
may
get
them
mixed
up,
but
section
36
a
is
section
88
a-35
of
--
that’s
a
same
one
in
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
bring
certain
kinds
of
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
private
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
really
going
one
step
beyond
that.
what
you’re
in
fact
saying
is
not
only
does
36
a
authorizes
the
united
–
the
sec
to
bring
in
action,
it
also
implicitly
authorizes
a
private
action
and
beyond
that
it
places
certain
restrictions
on
the
power
of
independent
directors
to
settle
such
an
action
after
it’s
been
brought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
granting
all
that,
where
is
anything
about
who
can
settle
such
an
action,
place
any
limitations
on
the
power
to
settle
such
an
action.
i’m
assuming
for
purposes
of
our
decision
just
the
same
assumption
you
make
there
is
a
private,
we’ll
assume
there
is
a
private
remedy.
we
are
not
talking
about
whether
there
is
a
private
remedy
we’re
talking
about
who
can
cut
off
the
private
remedy
and
what
in
the
statute
says
anything
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
findings
unreasonable
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
he
then
would
have
made
findings
on
the
reasonableness
of
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
still
get
the
thing
just,
i
don’t
mean
to
take
up
too
much
time,
but
he
could
have
acted
just
on
the
basis
of
state
law.
now,
the
other
side
says
well
you
can't
do
that
because
the
federal
statute
restricts
you
power
that,
the
independent
directors'
power
to
settle.
i
would
normally
look
to
some
provision
in
the
federal
statute
that
describes
the
powers
and
duties
of
independent
directors
rather
than
something
that
give
somebody
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
is
there
anything
that
says
those
directors
can't
settle
a
lawsuit,
that's
the
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
much
is
clear
is
it
not
mr.
ferrara
that
if
your
super
fiduciary
theory
is
correct
and
these
directors
have
found
to
have
acted
unreasonably
under
36(a)
they
would
be
personally
liable
to
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
why
would
that
be
important,
i
just
don’t
understand
you,
what
issue
would
that
been
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
einstein
if
i
understand
that
the
sec's
position
is
there
was
full
--
they
do
not
challenge
the
fully
informed
character
of
the
independent
directors'
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
quite
clear
that
the
restriction
on
discovery
of
which
you
complain
would
be
more
pertinent
to
the
question
of
full
information,
than
to
the
question
of
reasonable
information,
wouldn't
it?
perhaps
its
relevant
to
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
maybe
i
miss
something
that,
that
if
we
were
persuaded
and
i
don’t
know
whether
we
should
be
or
not,
that
the
sec
is
correct
in
saying
the
independent
directors
were
fully
informed,
then
we
shouldn’t
test
reasonableness
by
their
failure
to
get
more
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
clause
23.1
says,
as
you
need
the
approval
of
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that’s
the
approval
of
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
those
cases
all
deal
with
dismissals
by
the
shareholders
who
are
suing
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
where
the
evils
are
quite
different
and
that’s
those
are
evils
to
which
this
rule
directed
everybody
knows
that.
