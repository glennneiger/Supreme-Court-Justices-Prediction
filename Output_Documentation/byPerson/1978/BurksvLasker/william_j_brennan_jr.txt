justice
william

i
don’t
understand.
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
23.1
and
the
district
court
refused
to
apply
it,

we
send
it
back

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

in
the
first

you’re
right
as
the
23.1
contemplate
that
the
district
court
shall
make
the
initial
judgment
whether
the
23.1
has
been
satisfied?
