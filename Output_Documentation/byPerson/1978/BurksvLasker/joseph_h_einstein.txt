mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
wasn't
least
bit
worried.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
late
in
1969
the
mutual
fund
here
purchased
$20
million
worth
of
penn
central
notes.
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
it
entered
into
this
purchase
at
the
suggestion
of
its
advisor
anchor
corporation
in
a
situation
where
there
was
absolutely
no
investigation
whatsoever
conducted
as
to
the
propriety
of
this
$20
million
investment.
this
occurred
even
though
anchor
was
at
the
time
receiving
some
$4
million
per
year
for
allegedly
managing
the
portfolio
of
this
investment
fund.
now
in
buying
the
notes
not
only
did
anchor
fail
to
conduct
any
investigation,
but
it
failed
over
the
next
six
or
seven
months
to
be
aware
of
the
increasing
storm
signs
and
warnings
as
to
the
dismal
failing
condition
of
penn
central
and
failed
to
even
execute
a
buyout
or
a
sellout
of
the
notes
when
it
might
have.
moreover
there
was
an
internal
guideline
in
the
fund,
which
said
that
the
fund
should
not
purchase
commercial
paper
of
this
nature
unless
it
had
a
commitment
that
it
could
sell
it,
the
so
called
buyback
commitment.
now
in
the
reply
brief,
my
adversary
has
said
that
we
have
misleadingly
asserted
that
this
buyback
provision
was
violated
because
anchor
believed
that
it
had
such
an
understanding.
yet
judge
fuld
disagreed.
he
stated
at
page
113
of
the
appendix,
accordingly
it
appears
that
there
was
not
and
that
anchor
did
not
believe
there
was
an
illegal
binding
agreement
by
goldman
sachs
to
repurchase
penn
central
paper.
therefore,
i
think
the
case
comes
before
your
honors
in
the
situation
where
you
have,
in
my
judgment
and
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
a
rather
strong
showing
of
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
and
gross
abuse
of
trust
in
violation
of
the
1940
act
by
anchor
and
by
the
directors
at
that
time
of
the
mutual
fund.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
yes
i
do
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
think
it
goes
even
beyond
stupidity.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
that
is
absolutely
right
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
well
as
i’ll
come
to
in
a
moment
i
do
think
that
the
merits
of
the
action
do
very
much
bear
on
the
issue
here.
now
as
the
court
is
aware
there
was
this
lawsuit
brought
by
the
fund
against
goldman
sachs
alleging
fraud
and
misrepresentation
at
the
time
of
the
purchase.
now
that
suit
was
settled
for
slightly
over
25%
of
the
loss
and
i
must
advise
the
court
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
motivated
the
fund
to
settle
was
because
it
had
a
sophisticated
advisor
and
it
was
worried
that
if
it
pressed
a
litigation
the
effect
of
its
having
an
allegedly
sophisticated
advisor
might
militate
against
recovery.
now
even
if
you
take
the
$5
million
that’s
been
recovered
and
you
ascribe
whatever
value
you
want
to
these
pieces
of
paper
that
have
been
issued
to
the
fund
as
additional
settlement
value,
there
is
still
a
shortfall
here
of
$10
million,
$12
million,
$15
million,
which
we
believe
should
be
recouped
from
anchor
and
from
the
defendant
directors.
now
after
the
action
against
goldman
sachs
was
settled
the
motion
which
leads
us
to
this
court
today
was
interposed
by
the
defendants.
now
it’s
significant
to
note
that
shortly
after
the
penn
central
collapse
the
board
of
directors
of
the
fund
determined
to
sue
goldman
sachs.
they
also
determined
to
hold
in
abeyance
any
other
action
against
anyone
else.
now,
over
the
years
between
that
time
in
1970
and
1974
when
a
dismissal
motion
was
interposed,
the
fund
board
of
directors
did
change
and
composed
a
five-member
minority
of
the
board
who
are
independent
and
unaffiliated
with
anchor.
it
was
these
minority
directors
who
ultimately
determined
to
seek
dismissal
of
this
action.
now,
initially
when
the
motion
was
made
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
permitted
discovery
and
it
appears
on
page
20
of
the
appendix
on
a
very,
very
limited
claim.
he
permitted
discovery
to
pursue
the
relationship
of
the
minority
directors
and
the
qualifications
committee
to
determine
whether
the
minority
directors
were
disinterested
or
independent.
that
was
the
sole
scope
of
the
discovery
allowed
in
this
action.
now,
it’s
significant
to
note
that
the
discovery
permitted
did
not
include
any
discovery
on
the
merits,
did
not
include
any
discovery
on
the
nature
and
content
of
the
disclosures
made
to
judge
fuld
and
i
think
that’s
a
significant
area.
because
the
disinterested
minority
directors
could
only
act
based
upon
information
filtered
to
them
through
judge
fuld
through
their
special
counsel.
the
disclosures
being
made
to
special
counsel
with
the
disclosures
of
the
defendant
directors
and
anchor
corporation
made
not
under
oath
but
in
informal
discussions.
now,
i
think
it
was
important
for
the
district
judge
to
have
had
and
he
could
not
have
had
in
this
case
an
indication
of
whether
the
full
mix
of
available
information
was
supplied
to
judge
fuld
and
through
him
to
the
minority
independent
directors.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
that
would
go
to
the
reasonableness
mr.
justice
stevens
of
the
dismissal
of
the
action,
and
i
submit
to
you
as
a
principle
thesis
here
and
one
that
has
been
overlooked
and
not
mentioned
up
till
now
that
this
case
is
governed
very
much
by
rule
23.1
promulgated
by
this
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
don’t
see
how
anybody
on
this
record
can
assert
with
all
deference
to
the
sec
that
the
directors
were
fully
informed.
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
which
will
disclose
what
information
was
given
to
the
director
and
what
information
may
have
been
withheld.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
think
it’s
relevant
to
both
and
i
think
the
question
of
merits
also
is
relevant
because
a
decision
to
dismiss
a
case
that
has
a
weak
merit
might
be
supportable
on
very
slim
business
judgment
rules
whereas
if
the
case
has
strong
merit
you
would
need
more
to
support
dismissal.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
if
they
were
fully
informed,
they
were
fully
informed.
i
just
submit
to
your
honor
that
this
record
clearly
demonstrates
--
is
silent
on
that
issue
and
indeed
we
believe
that
they
were
not
fully
informed.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
don’t
believe
he
did
your
honor.
the
district
judge
opinion
really
proceeds
strictly
on
the
authority
of
the
majority
--
of
the
minority
quorum
to
bring
about
this
business.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
yes
your
honor
he
did,
and
that
finding
was
in
affect
overruled
by
the
second
circuit
both
i
believe
on
the
facts
and
on
the
law.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
second
circuit
your
honor,
the
opinion
i
find
somewhat
ambivalent
on
this
issue
because
if
you
look
at
pages
a46
and
47
of
the
appendix
where
the
opinion
appears,
second
circuit
clearly
discusses
the
fact
that
these
directors
serve
not
only
as
directors
on
this
fund's
board
but
on
a
number
of
other
boards
where
funds
are
managed
by
anchor
and
received
$11,000
to
$13,000
per
annum
compensation.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
thank
you,
your
honor.
which
says
at
page
263
of
244
us,
courts
interfere
seldom
to
control
such
discretion
intra
vires
the
corporation
except
where
the
directors
are
guilty
of
misconduct
equivalent
to
breach
of
trust
or
where
they
stand
in
a
dual
relation
which
prevents
an
unprejudiced
exercise
of
judgment.
now
under
those
standards,
i
think
it’s
very
clear
that
this
minority
of
the
board
could
not
act
and
the
board
could
not
act.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
no,
i
think
my
claims
can
be
properly
tested
out
in
the
district
court
which
has
a
--
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
no,
on
this
action
after
all
we
are
now
six
years
since
this
action
was
filed
and
still
in
the
preliminary
procedures
without
ever
having
an
answer
filed
or
any
discovery
and
i
think
that
the
claims
can
be
tested
out
in
the
district
court,
which
can
easily
and
under
very
familiar
standards
deal
with
all
these
questions.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
because
they
seek
to
exculpate
the
majority
of
the
board
from
serious
substantiated
charges
of
wrongdoing,
that’s
why
it
is
different.
they
are
not
--
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
that’s
right.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
but
they’re
seeking
to
exculpate
fellow
directors.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
think
that
under
the
stand
--
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
think
that
under
the
standards
of
rule
23.1
i
don’t
have
to
go
through
that
procedure
that
i
can
present
those
arguments
and
have
them
considered
by
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
that’s
23.1.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
23.1,
23
is
class
actions,
23.1
is
derivative
actions.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
that’s
correct
and
the
case
–
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
but
the
case
law
first
of
all
requires
notice
to
the
stockholders
and
the
case
law
that
has
surrounded
rule
23.1
has
made
it
very
clear
that
the
court
has
to
consider
the
propriety
of
the
dismissal
of
business
judgment
reasons,
the
merits
of
the
action
to
make
sure
that
dismissal
is
proper.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
with
all
deference
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
where
a
majority
of
a
board
of
directors
of
a
new
board
that
has
turned
over
during
the
course
of
a
litigation
has
come
into
court
to
seek
dismissal
of
a
derivative
action
and
in
each
of
those
cases
and
they
are
cited
at
pages
43
through
49,
50
of
our
brief,
in
each
of
those
cases
where
a
majority,
a
new
and
concededly
independent
majority
came
into
the
corporation,
the
court
conducted
a
painstaking,
extensive
hearing
to
determine
whether
dismissal
was
appropriate.
now,
that’s
birnbaum
against
birrel
decided
by
chief
judge
edelstein
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
decided
that
burger
against
dyson,
denicke
against
the
anglo
california
national
bank,
all
decided
that,
and
indeed
goodwin
against
castleton,
a
washington
case
also
reached
the
same
result.
whereas
the
courts
in
all
of
those
cases
even
where
a
majority
of
the
board
came
in
and
asked
for
the
dismissal
refused
to
simply
rubber
stamp
that
dismissal.
they
examined
the
merits
of
the
action.
they
examined
the
business
judgment
reasons
and
only
then
if
the
court
deemed
it
proper
was
the
derivative
action
permitted
to
be
dismissed.
now,
i
think
that’s
very
different
than
what
occurred
here.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
yes,
they
did
and
the
corporation
received
something.
in
each
of
those
cases
there
was
consideration
running
to
the
corporation
in
connection
with
the
settlement.
here
the
corporation
receives
nothing.
this
case
is
not
–
is
being
dismissed
without
any
compensation
to
the
corporation.
i
think
that
heightens
the
obligation
of
the
court
to
see
that
the
dismissal
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
shareholder.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
question
whether
delaware
law
gives
the
minority
power.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
if
there
was
a
majority
of
directors
that
decide
to
do
it,
i
think
the
court
would
have
the
obligation
to
examine
the
compromise
to
make
sure
it
was
fair
and
appropriate.
who
is
to
say
that
the
new
board
may
not
have
had
some
kind
of
an
arrangement
with
the
defendants,
you
never
know
that.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
there
was
quorum
action,
it’s
a
minority,
it’s
5
out
of
a
11
directors.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
but
the
law
of
the
delaware
says
that
a
minority
that
a
quorum
can
be
a
minority.
the
law
of
delaware
also
says
that
when
you
bring
a
derivative
action
and
less
and
more
–
i’m
sorry
and
a
majority
of
the
board
is
charged
with
wrongdoing,
you
don’t
have
to
make
a
demand,
that’s
federal
law
and
that’s
delaware
law.
now,
if
you
don’t
have
to
make
a
demand
where
there’s
a
minority
quorum
in
order
to
bring
a
derivative
action,
do
i
have
--
there’s
a
litigant
then
every
month
or
every
year,
when
there’s
a
new
election
have
to
make
a
new
demand
because
maybe
the
composition
of
that
board
has
changed
or
if
you
follow
it
to
its
end,
if
there’s
a
minority
quorum
do
you
have
to
make
a
demand
on
that
minority
let
it
act
and
then
have
a
threshold
litigation
on
the
appropriateness
in
minority
action.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
but
i
think
that’s
where
there,
that’s
where
the
flaw
is
in
my
advisory’s
position
because
rule
23.1
and
the
decisions
under
both
federal
and
delaware
grant
access
to
the
courts
that
the
federal
and
state
courts
whenever
a
majority
of
the
board
is
charged
with
wrongdoing
without
the
necessity
of
a
demand.
now,
if
you’re
in
court
on
that
theory
i
don’t
see
how
or
why
it’s
appropriate
to
have
the
same
minority
turn
around
the
next
day
or
the
next
week
or
the
next
month
and
spin
your
right
back
out
of
court
again.
i
don’t
think
rule
23.1
contemplates
it
or
the
delaware
law
contemplates
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
that’s
correct
and
the
state
corporation
law
of
delaware
is
in
effect
rule
23.1
and
a
decision
is
under
--
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
think
the
district
court
--
well,
i
have
serious
question
your
honor
about
whether
a
minority
has
the
standing
or
the
power
to
bring
the
question
before
the
board,
before
the
court.
let’s
assume
it
does.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
alright
let’s
assume
that
it
has
--
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
no,
the
district
court
would
have
to
consider
the
application
and
weigh
it
on
the
merits,
is
the
dismissal
in
the
best
interest
of
the
stockholders.
is
the
quorum
group
independent?
what
are
the
reasons
which
allegedly
support
dismissal?
what
is
the
merit
of
the
action?
what
are
all
the
relevant
factors
and
then
make
an
informed
judgment.
district
courts
do
this
all
the
time
in
settling
class
and
derivative
actions
under
rules
23
and
23.1.
this
is
nothing
new,
it
is
nothing
extraordinary;
it
doesn’t
broaden
the
burdens
of
obligations
with
the
district
court.
i’m
not
suggesting
as
i
think
some
concern
was
expressed
before
that
an
entirely
new
procedure
be
created
that
there
need
be
full
discovery
as
if
the
case
was
being
prepared
to
trial
on
the
merits.
all
that
is
required
is
that
the
district
judge
afford
the
objecting
party
an
opportunity
for
reasonable
discovery
in
the
discretion
of
the
judge
and
then
pass
on
these
issues.
there
have
been
many
cases
your
honor,
where
district
court
have
refused
settlements
because
they
thought
they
were
unreasonable.
and
i
think
that
the
district
court
has
that
power
and
authority.
now,
i
would
like
to
pass
on
to
one
other
matter
and
that
is
the
fact
of
the
subsequent
removal
of
anchor
as
the
fund’s
advisor
because
i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
great
significance
in
this
litigation.
anchor
is
no
longer
the
advisor
and
one
of
the
alleged
motivating
factors
in
connection
with
the
action
of
the
minority
directors
here
was
that
continued
litigation
would
so
adversely
affect
the
fund’s
relationship
with
anchor
that
that
relationship
would
be
destroyed.
since
the
relationship
no
longer
exists,
i
have
serious
doubt
is
to
whether
there
is
any
further
basis
for
dismissal
of
this
action.
now,
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
decisions
in
mcleod
versus
general
electric
385
us
533
and
patterson
v.
alabama
294
us
600
and
i
read
the
citations
because
they
are
not
in
our
brief,
which
clearly
indicate
that
when
there
is
a
set
of
circumstances
which
has
occurred
between
the
time
of
a
decision
and
a
time
of
a
hearing
in
this
court,
this
court
can
and
should
look
to
these
additional
facts
and
circumstances
in
reaching
a
decision
and
korn
against
franchard
which
is
reported
at
456
f.2d
1206
indicates
that
where
the
circumstance
is
so
strong
and
compelling
as
i
believe
this
one
is
that
it
mandates
a
different
result
or
i
believe
in
our
case
it
would
mandate
an
affirmance
because
it
undercuts
the
decision
for
the
reasons
for
dismissal
that
the
court
can
grant
the
appropriate
relief
and
need
not
merely
remand
the
case
for
another
look
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
mcleod
versus
general
electric
385
us
533,
patterson
v.
alabama
294
us
600
and
the
second
circuit
case
is
korn
v
franchard
456
f.2nd
1206.
i’ve
hadn’t
cited
these
because
the
issue
of
this
court’s
ability
to
consider
this
fact
was
only
raised
in
my
advisory’s
reply
brief
to
which
i
of
course
hadn’t
--
i
believe
patterson
was
a
criminal
case.
i
believe
so.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
well,
what
the
case,
what
those
two
cases
stand
for;
mcleod
is
a
nlrb
case
and
korn
v.
franchard
is
a
class
action
decertification
case.
all
of
them
clearly
indicate
that
where
a
subsequent
fact
has
occurred
after
the
decision
but
before
the
hearing
of
the
appeal
the
court
can
and
should
look
at
that
subsequent
fact
and
take
the
appropriate
action.
in
summary
your
honors,
i
would
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
was
clearly
correct
within
the
narrow
confines
of
the
cases
decided
by
that
court.
when
you
look
at
the
specific
facts
at
bar
and
consider
them
in
light
of
the
history
and
purposes
of
the
1940
act,
we
believe
that
the
decision
was
correct.
we
also
believe
--
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
the
district
judge
rejected
the
position,
the
rule
23.1
was
applicable.
the
question
was
briefed
in
the
second
circuit
but
never
reached
by
the
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
that’s
correct.
it
did
not
applied
and
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
question.
now
we
also
believe
your
honors
is
that
if
you
do
not
follow
the
rationale
of
the
second
circuit
and
view
the
case
as
one
under
rule
23.1
requiring
hearing
as
a
prerequisite
to
dismissal,
and
when
you
look
at
the
factors
that
the
court
must
consider
that
on
this
record,
specially
given
the
subsequent
termination
of
the
anchors,
the
fund’s
advisor,
there’s
no
rational
or
reasonable
basis
for
the
dismissal
of
this
action.
the
action
should
be
allow
to
proceed.
the
alleged
harm
which
the
fund
perceived
it
could
suffer
by
further
prosecution
to
this
action,
of
this
action
is
no
longer
existent.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
because
when
you
look
at
the
factors
that
rule
23.1
requires
mr.
justice
brennan,
consideration
of
the
merits,
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
there
was
merit.
the
question
of
independence,
the
court
of
appeals
question
that,
and
the
so
called
business
judgment
reasons,
the
reasonableness
of
the
decision
particularly
you
find
that
the
business
judgment
reasons
no
longer
exist
because
of
the
termination
of
anchor.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
yes,
but
if
you
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
refused
against
a
dismissal
and
your
view
of
the
case
today
was
that
it
had
to
be
retained,
it
could
not
be
dismissed,
we
just
have
an
up
and
down
procedure
again
without
any
reason
or
purpose.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
think
in
this
case
with
the
removal
of
anchor
the
facts
are
so
clear
that
they
mandate
only
one
result
and
that
is
the
rationale
and
teaching
of
korn
against
franchard
which
i
cited
to
the
court
before.
i
see
my
time
is
done,
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
i
think
about
200
each
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
einstein
well,
i
know
there
is
a
140,000
stockholders
of
the
fund.
it's
quite
a
large
fund.
there
are
many
millions
of
shares
outstanding.
i
do
not
recall
the
number.
