justice
potter
stewart
has
the
value
of
those
yet
been
ascertained?
justice
potter
stewart
if
all
of
the
directors
were
directors
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
erroneous
action,
negligent
or
wrongful
action
on
the
part
of
the
corporation
and
the
derivative
shareholders
sued
them
all
and
then
he
could
in
fact
do
exactly
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
[voice
overlap]
derivative
suits
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
language
is
a
little
broader
than
facts
of
life,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
what
you
read
from
is
the
federal
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
your
argument
and
may
be
i’m
just
seeing
the
same
thing
in
another
way
or
maybe
misunderstand
your
argument,
was
that,
this
is
a
matter
of
delaware
law
where
this
place
--
this
company
was
incorporated.
justice
potter
stewart
until
and
unless
there
is
something
in
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
or
the
investment
advisers
act
or
somewhere
else
in
federal
law
that
tell
us
that
delaware
law
shall
not
control?
justice
potter
stewart
and
upon
your
examination
of
the
federal
laws,
you
find
that
there
is
nothing
there
to
supersede
delaware
law?
justice
potter
stewart
as
matter
of
argument
you
just
don’t
agree
with
it?
justice
potter
stewart
we
come
out
the
same
way
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
statutory
requirement
of
40%
disinterested
directors
came
into
the
act
in
the
19,
what
70
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
this
formally
on
affiliated.
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
these
directors
--
these
directors
where
not
directors
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
of
the
penn
central.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
question
is
there
that
they
meet
the
at
least
the
statuary
definition
of
being
disinterested
directors.
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
the
word
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
keeps
telling
what.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
sec
both
does
and
doesn't
support
your
theory
from
what
you
have
quoted
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
where
it
is
in
the
discretion,
the
unreviewable
discretion
of
the
independent
disinterested
directors
or
majority
of
quorum
to
make
decisions
on
the
behalf
of
the
corporation.
but
then
the
sec
says
what
here
from
the
note,
i
know
but
in
this
kind
of
case
since
it’s
a
mutual
company
it’s
incumbent
upon
the
district
to
look
at
the
fundamental
fairness
and
rectitude
of
the
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so
then
it's
incumbent
upon
the
district
judge
to
see
if
it
was
a
reasonable
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
seem
to
follow
of
what
you
are
quoting
to
us
that
it’s
not
incumbent
at
all
on
anybody,
if
the
directors
have
the
power?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
judge
who
was
persuaded
by
your
argument,
that
this
is
in
within
the
unreviewable
power
of
disinterested
directors
to
make
the
decision,
would
have
dismissed
the
case
even
if
he
or
might
well
have
dismissed
the
case
would
have
even
if
he
had
thought
that
this
decision
might
have
been
very
unreasonable
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
the
logic
of
your
argument
and
indeed
the
logic
of
the
language
of
the
sec
brief
that's
quoted
to
us,
leads
to
a
conclusion
that
would
exclude
any
oversight
by
a
--
by
a
federal
judge
of
whether
or
not
the
decision
was
reasonable,
however
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
does
the
delaware
law
provides
again?
justice
potter
stewart
but
does
it
say.
justice
potter
stewart
by
laws
say
with
the
minimum
of
one-third.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ferrara
you
find
this
federal
limitation
and
requirement
in
fiduciary
obligations
imposed
by
the
1940
act
and
in
the
general
purpose
of
congress,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
to
be
found
somewhere
–
[voice
overlap]
justice
potter
stewart
your
claim
that
any
of
those
provisions
were
violated
in
this
case,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
the
numbers,
you
find
it
in
the
numbers--
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn’t
right
of
a
private
remedy,
it's
a
derivative
law
suit
brought
on
behalf
of
the
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
under
no
authority
of
the
investment
company
act
of
1940,
but
under
quite
different
authorization?
justice
potter
stewart
directors
always
have
fiduciaries
vis-à-vis
the
shareholders,
there
is
nothing
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
have
been
exactly
what
he
should
have
said
had
delaware
law
exclusively
applied,
you’d
agree
with
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no
it
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
very
much
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
if
delaware
law
exclusively
applies
to
this
case
then
it’s
a
very
important
to
know
what
delaware
law
is.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
claim
here
that
the
direct
--
that
these
disinterested
directors
acted
in
bad
faith?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
and
isn’t
that
the
test
to
delaware
law?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
they
could
be
very
badly
mistaken
but
still
be
in
complete
good
faith
and
wholly
disinterested?
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
at
the
same
time
make
what
somebody
else
would
think
would
be
an
unreasonable
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
your
box
i
don’t
know
anything
else
here.
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
your
claim
that
the
penumbras
of
the
1940
act
put
some
limitation
on
what
would
ordinarily
be
as
the
provisions
of
state
law.
if
you
are
mistaken,
then
it’s
i
submit
it’s
quite
important
and
not
at
all
irrelevant
to
know
what
the
state
law
is.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
basis
of
your
derivative
shareholders
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
really
--
only
tangentially
is
--
it
bears
an
issue
here.
justice
potter
stewart
or
all
these
directors
had
any
power
to
do
what
they
did?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you’re
saying
would
lead
me
to
believe
that
you,
if
you
want
to
you
can
file
another
derivative
suit
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
grounded
upon
the
wrongful
action
of
these
directors
in
making
this
business
decision
to
settle
this
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
where
your
claims
would
be
appropriately
tested
out,
isn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
no
it
would
be
in
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
generally
the
business
of
directors
who
are
fiduciaries
with
respect
to
the
shareholders
to
make
these
business
decisions
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
the
district
court
found
that
these
were
disinterested
directors
both
in
fact
and
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute
that
they
acted
by
a
majority
of
the
quorum,
and
that
they
acted
in
good
faith.
and
why
is
this
business
decision
any
different
from
any
other
business
decision
that
a
directors
should
--
are
trusted
with
making.
justice
potter
stewart
their
original
action
was
brought
on
the
--
for
other
corporation
on
behalf
of
the
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
these
directors
are
acting
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
they’re
seeking
to
do,
they’re
making
a
business
decision
for
the
corporation
like
any
other
business
decision
for
the
corporation,
and
if
you
think
that
they
acted
wrongly
you
can
bring
another
stockholder’s
derivative
suit.
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
against
them?
justice
potter
stewart
in
rule
23
against
dismissing
or
compromising
that
within
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
23.1.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it’s
23.1
it
follows.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
in
each
case
as
i
just
reading
it,
i’m
not
familiar
with
it,
i
read
the
opinion
birnbaum
against
birrel
and
burger
against
dyson
as
i
read
the
description
in
your
brief,
the
shareholder
plaintiffs
received
something
too,
didn’t
they?
