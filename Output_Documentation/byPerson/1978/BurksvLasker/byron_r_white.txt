justice
byron
r.
white
where
would
this
court
get
rule
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
would
take
it,
you
probably
don’t
agree
with
the
united
states'
amicus
brief
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
think
there
is
any
room
for
a
federal
rule
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now,
how
about,
do
you
agree
with
the
united
states
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
i
want
to
know.
so
you
don’t
think
there
is
any
room
for
a
federal
rule
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
disagree
with
united
states
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that’s,
your
first
preference
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
disinterested
directors?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
standard
in
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
read
it,
can
you
read
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
--
i
don’t
still
don’t
think
you
have
answered
mr.
justice
stevens
that
where
is
a
--
what
specifically
in
the
statue
forbids
or
forbids
a
settlement
unless
you
go
through
this
ritual.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
know
there
is
a
question,
just
how
specific
must
a
federal
law
be
and
in
cort
against
ash
the
court
said
and
i’m
for
sure
you
must
be
quite
familiar
with
that
statement
in
cort
against
ash
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
except
where
federal
law
expressly
requires
certain
responsibilities
and
directives
with
respect
to
it
the
state
law
will
govern
internal
affairs
of
corporation.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
respond
to
justice
stevens'
question
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
you
are
putting
quiet
a
gloss
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
know,
some
federal
judge
will
think
it’s
a
very
mild
veracity
as
to
sit
down
and
decide
whether
the
judgment
is
reasonable.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
asking
to
do
something
that
he
wouldn’t
have
to
do
under
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
must
concede
that
just
under
your
formulation
a
district
judge
could
conclude
this
is
an
unreasonable
decision
by
the
directors
and
set
it
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
that,
that’s
a
bootstrap,
that’s
a
bootstrap
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying,
yes
a
district
judge
can
under
your
formulation
set
it
aside
as
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
he
always
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
don’t
you
say
on
your
formulations
he
may
set
it
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
now
a
state
court
wouldn’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
court
would
find
the
directors'
action
to
be
quiet
consistent
and
would
not
set
it
aside
and
you
suggest
that
under
your
formulation
a
federal
court
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
--
it
is
apparent
then
you’re
the
rule,
you
are
advancing
would
certainly
i
suppose
a
fortiori
or
not
applied
it
to
compromises.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
directors
wanted
to
compromise
a
suit
and
wanted
to
settle
it,
it
could
not
do,
they
could
not
do
so
over
the
objection
of
the
plaintiffs
even
if
state
law
would
given
them
that
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
in
a
federal
court,
a
derivative
action
unless
there’s
some
federal
statute
that
the
state
corporation
law
is
going
to
govern
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn’t
think
that,
you
wouldn’t
think
that
--
do
you
think
under
23.1,
the
district
judge
could
just
say,
“i’m
just
not
going
to
approve
the
settlement
because
this
is
just
by
a
majority
of
a
minority
quorum?”
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
does
and
it’s
clear
under
delaware
law
that
it
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
a
district
court
just
ignore
that
and
say
i’m
not
even
going
to
consider
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn’t
the
district
judge
i
suppose
thought
he
was
complying
with
rule
23?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
rule
23
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
might
affirm
a
judgment
we
did
that
--
we
might
not
have
made
in
the
first
instance
ourselves
just
because
sometime
--
it
might
rest
on
findings
that
are
clearly
erroneous?
