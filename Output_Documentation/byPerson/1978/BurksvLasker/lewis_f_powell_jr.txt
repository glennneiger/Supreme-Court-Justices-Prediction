justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
like
to
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions.
let's
assume
that
we
agreed
with
the
position
of
the
commission,
remanded
the
case
for
the
application
your
your
three-part
test,
the
third
part
of
which
has
been
the
subject
of
a
good
deal
of
discussion,
what
do
you
think
the
district
court
would
do
in
the
way
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
independent
directors
had
exercised
a
reasonable
judgment
in
our
court
to
say
that
the
district
judge
had
a
very
substantial
amount
of
information
before
him.
do
you
think
he
could
act
on
that
information,
judge
fuld
report
the
discussions
of
the
independent
directors
with
independent
experts
or
do
you
think
you
have
to
have
another
full
blown
trial,
an
evidentiary
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that’s
a
question
separate
from
reasonableness
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
would
like
to
interrupt
you
here
a
minute.
if
you
got
to
try
this
case
on
the
merits
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
wait
a
minute,
the
question
would
be
in
very
summary
terms
whether
or
not
the
management
had
exercised
the
degree
of
care
required
of
management
in
purchasing
the
penn
central
commercial
paper.
do
you
agree
with
that
so
far?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that’s
right.
well
in
other
words
whether
or
not
there
was
a
fat
chance
to
win
the
case
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
might
have
a
bearing
on
whether
the
independent
directors
exercised
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
a
reasonable
judgment.
is
it
your
suggestion
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
make
a
judgment
himself
as
to
whether
there
was
a
fat
chance
to
win
the
case?
if
so,
wouldn’t
he
have
to
try
almost
a
full
blown
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
think
he
must
look
in
to
the
merits?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
district
judge
make
a
finding
on
that
point?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
did
find
they
were
independent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
also
found
that
they
acted
in
good
faith?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
as
i
read
the
second
circuit
it
didn’t
overrule
of
finding
a
fact.
it
merely
questioned
whether
anyone
could
be
an
independent
director
at
anytime
on
any
circumstances?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
your
class
still
own
the
shares
of
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
in
the
fund?
how
many
shares
do
they
own
is
out
of
interest?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
400
out
of
how
many?
