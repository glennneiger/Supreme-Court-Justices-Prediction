mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
believes
that
an
understanding
of
the
relationships
between
state
and
federal
law
as
they
impact
upon
the
governance
of
investment
companies
is
critical
to
a
resolution
of
the
issues
presented
in
this
case.
first,
we
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
corporate
directors
and
not
federal
judges
should
be
given
the
fullest
opportunity
under
state
law
and
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
to
manage
the
business
affairs
of
investment
companies.
on
the
other
hand,
we
agree
with
the
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
superimposes
upon
basic
state
law
provisions,
a
pervasive
array
of
federal
controls,
controls
which
we
believe
create
federal
standards
to
assure
that
the
operation
of
the
act
will
not
be
frustrated
by
the
possible
laxity
of
the
law
of
an
individual
state.
now,
the
proper
reconciliation
of
both
the
state
and
federal
interests,
we
believe,
would
be
to
prohibit
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
as
interested
directors
of
an
investment
company
from
terminating
even
non
frivolous
derivative
litigation
nor
however
would
that
law
or
would
that
reconciliation
embrace
the
most
recent
state
court
formulation
of
the
delaware
business
judgment
rule
as
the
sole
standard
by
which
to
judge
directorial
action.
rather
we
believe
that
the
state
and
the
federal
interests
can
be
balanced
by
according
full
discretion
to
the
directors'
judgments
so
long
as
they
are
independent,
they
are
fully
informed
and
they
act
reasonably.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
our
authority,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it
doesn’t
and
i
think
that.
i
think
that
-–
that
section
36
a
of
the
investment
company
act,
the
fiduciary
standard,
the
provision
of
the
act
that
imposes
upon
disinterested
directors
of
an
investment
company,
the
responsibility
to
not
breach
fiduciary
duties
is
the
heart
of
our
argument,
but
around
that
argument
is
a
regulatory
statute,
a
federal
regulatory
statute
which
super
imposes
an
array
of
controls
upon
the
composition
of
the
board
of
directors,
how
directors
are
selected,
the
manner
in
which
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
no,
we
don’t,
but
we
do
say
that
surrounding
section
36
a
there
are
those
other
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
we
recall
mr.
justice
that
section
36
a
of
the
act,
the
general
fiduciary
standard
prescribes
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
involving
personal
misconduct
and
the
house
and
the
senate
at
the
time
they
enacted
those
provisions
in
1970
said
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
you
might.
see
unfortunately
the
court
of
a
--
the
district
court
judge
in
this
case
found
that
all
state
law
would
require
is
that
the
directors
be
independent
and
act
in
good
faith.
the
congress
is
required
in
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
that
there
be
an
additional
ingredient,
that
is
that
their
decisions
be
reasonable,
that
additional
ingredient
finds
its
heart
in
section
36
a,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
in
the
house
and
senate
reports
that
a
company,
the
enactment
of
that
section
where
they
provided
in
these
words
that
36
a
proscribed
non-feasance
of
duty
and
abdication
of
responsibility.
abdication
of
responsibility,
those
words
go
far
beyond
we
think
that
typical
fraud
statute
that’s
found
in
one
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
they
expand
upon
notions
of
fiduciary
duty
as
found
even
in
delaware
law.
now
does
that
mean
that
delaware
law
has
to
be
displaced
by
a
federal
standard,
no.
but
does
it
mean
that
when
the
delaware
statute
or
idaho
statute
or
an
ohio
statue
says
that
directors
shall
be
a
court
of
the
business
judgment
rule
in
the
courts
of
that
state
say
that
the
business
judgment
rule
only
needs
to
be
tested
against
the
independence
and
good
faith
standard,
that
if
it’s
an
investment
company
an
additional
standard
needs
to
be
employed,
we
think
the
investment
company
act
says
that
we
think
the
court
say
that’s
how
you
interpret
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it
does
indeed.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
the
issues
that
you’re
implicitly
raising
mr.
justice
stevens
is
whether
there
is
an
implied
right
of
action
under
section
36
a
of
the
investment
company
act.
that’s
an
issue
that
is
specifically
not
in
this
case,
however
the
courts
have
found
that
notwithstanding
the
language
of
the
statue
that
the
commission
may
bring
an
action
to
enjoin,
but
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
under
36.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
courts
have
rather
consistently
held
that
position
although
again
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
it’s
not
been
raised
by
the
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
justice
stevens
i’m
sure
that
the
day
is
going
to
come
when
myself
or
one
of
my
successors
are
going
to
be
here
arguing
the
case
that
36
a
creates
an
implied
right
of
action
for
private
litigants
under
the
federal
--
under
the
investment
company
act.
we
don’t
have
to
take
that
decision
now.
nor
we
--
nor
does
this
case
involves
the
commission’s
power
to
bring
an
adjunctive
action
under
36a.
all
it
does
say
is
that
whoever
has
the
right
to
bring
the
action,
the
private
party
or
the
commission,
the
standard
upon
which
the
action
has
to
be
based
is
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
this
recall,
this
is
not
this
is
not
a
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
nothing
in
the
statute
quite
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it
is
indeed
and
the
posture
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
the
allegations
containing
violation
of
the
investment
company
act
1940
and
the
advisors
act,
two
federal
claims.
now
you
are
quite
correct
procedurally
this
case
involves
the
disposition
of
the
derivative
action
and
in
the
context
where
a
federal
district
court
judge
was
being
asked
in
a
contested
claim
in
a
voluntary
dismissal
whether
the
action
should
be
dismissed
and
the
federal
district
court
judge
was
faced
with
the
situation
of
whether
to
dismiss
the
action
over
the
objections
of
the
plaintiffs
who
had
instituted
the
action.
in
that
context
the
federal
district
court
judge
was
forced
to
sort
out
the
basis
upon
which
he
dismissed
the
action
and
he
did
that
by
we
think
reference
to
both
state
law
standards,
the
delaware
law,
independence
in
good
faith
and
by
reference
to
the
federal
standards.
i
quite
frankly
think
that
if
tannenbaum
against
zeller,
the
case
that
we
cite
is
authority
for
the
three-prong
test
that
we
urge
in
our
brief
had
been
decided
at
the
time
this
district
court
judge
had
before
him
the
dismissal
of
this
action
that
his
conduct
in
the
action
may
have
been
a
little
different
and
his
decision
may
have
read
slightly
differently.
i’m
not
sure
that
the
result
would
have
changed,
but
that’s
not
our
job.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i’m
sorry.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
think
he
would
have
we’re
not
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
but
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
clearly
details
that
not
only
prescribes
the
duties
of
independent
directors
are,
but
says
that
you
can't
even
have
board
of
directors
unless
40%
of
them
disinterested
and
then
says
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
no,
the
question
is
not
whether
not
they
cancel
the
lawsuit,
but
whether
in
the
process
of
settling
the
lawsuit
they
breached
their
fiduciary
duties
to
the
shareholders
of
the
fund.
they
are
direct
--
a
disinterested
director
or
any
director
of
an
investment
company
simply
can't
without
reference
to
any
standard,
without
reference
to
any
standard
dismiss
a
lawsuit.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
standard
in
the
section
36
a
because
all
of
the
directors--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
section
36a
prescribes
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
based
upon--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
the
statute
doesn’t
say
what
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
it
is,
but
the
congress
and
both
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
when
they
passed
that
statute
said
what
they
thought
it
met.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
let
me,
let
me
try
once
again.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
indeed
i
am
sir.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
you
have
raised
two
questions.
let
me
try
to
respond
to
your
first
question
which
is
also
mr.
justice
stevens'
question.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
alright.
first
the
investment
company
act
clearly
defines
the
composition
of
a
board
of
directors,
40%
must
be
disinterested.
now
in
all
actions
taken
by
those
directors,
dismissals
of
lawsuits,
purchases
of
securities
whatever
the
directorial
action
called
for,
those
directors'
conduct
is
guided
by
section
36(a).
section
36(a)
says
that
in
whatever
the
director
is
doing,
dismissing
a
lawsuit
or
otherwise
that
director
cannot
breach
a
fiduciary
duty.
the
house
in
the
senate
say,
what
a
fiduciary
duty
is?
and
that
is
nonfeasance
of
duty
or
abdication
of
responsibility.
consequently,
in
deciding
whether
the
directors
lived
up
to
their
responsibilities
under
section
36(a)
and
in
this
case
one
has
to
determine
whether
they
abdicated
their
responsibility
or
engaged
in
nonfeasance.
now
returning
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
but
you
know
always
--
you
are
quiet
right
mr.
justice
stewart
all
directors
are
fiduciaries
but
here
because
of
section
36(a)
i
suppose
you
would
say
investment
company
directors
are
super
fiduciaries,
particularly
disinterested
directors,
because
there
is
no
other
federal
statute,
not
the
securities
act,
not
the
securities
exchange
act,
not
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
of
1934,
35
i’m
sorry,
no
other
federal
statute
has
express
provision
that
says
that
these
directors
have
to
have
a
fiduciary
duty.
recall,
this
is
not
green
against
santa
fe,
and
getting
back
to
the
question
of
it,
this
is
not
green
against
santa
fe,
this
is
not
a
section
10(b)(5)
that
involves
fraud,
deception
or
manipulation,
this
is
a
section
36(a)
that
talks
in
terms
of
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty.
now
returning
to
the
question
about
cort
against
ash
and
green
and
santa
fe,
clearly
the
court
in
those
cases
said
that
state
law
is
not
going
to
be
displaced
unless
there
is
a
federal
statute,
which
expressly
calls
for
that.
this
case
is
not
green
and
santa
fe,
it
doesn’t
involve
section
10(b)
what
this
court
found
be
a
disclosure
based
statute,
but
rather
36(a)
and
we
are
not
trying
to
displace
the
entirety
of
state
law.
all
we
are
suggesting,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
a
very
modest
gloss
i
would
suggest.
once
you
have
determined
that
state
law
requires
independence
and
good
faith
we
think
that
asking
that
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
we
are
not
asking
that
he
substitute
his
judgment
for
that
of
the
directors.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
we
are
asking
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
clearly.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does
thin
it
out
a
little
bit
and
that’s
exactly
why
we
can’t
be
here
fully
supporting
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
we
think
went
too
far
and
would
have
substituted
the
federal
judiciary
for
the
disinterested
directors.
we
are
saying
that
that
federal
district
court
judge
should
not
substitute
his
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
directors,
but
only
in
reviewing
this
action
that
he
determine
whether
the
directors
acted
reasonably
in
the
same
process
that
he
has
to
decide
whether
they
were
independent
and
acting
with
faith.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
impression
left
by
our
brief
is
that
we
are
asking
a
federal
district
court
judge
to
become
a
director
of
an
investment
company
then
our
brief
reads
incorrectly.
we
are
not
asking
that.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
district
court
judge
could,
the
district
court
judge
could
consistent
with,
actually
a
line
of
authority
that
stretches
back
to
1917
in
this
court’s
case
and
in
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
district
court
judges
all
the
time
and
in
different
kinds
of
context
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
conduct
is
reasonable.
at
the
time
a
district
court
judge
is
doing
that
he
doesn’t
always
substitute
his
judgment.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
absolutely,
but
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
no,
no
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
absolutely
agree
that
a
district
court
judge
may
set
upside
directors
--
directorial
action
as
unreasonable.
but
i
don’t
say
that,
i
mean
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
state
court
would
have
never
reached
the
question,
because
the
state
court
never
considered
the
question;
they
considered
something
else
slightly
different.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
no
i
say
that
if
the
state
court
viewed
reasonableness
as
a
criteria
of
its
review
then
it
could
set
it
aside.
the
federal
judge
in
setting
aside,
empowering
the
federal
judge
to
set
aside
directorial
action
as
unreasonable
though
again
i
suggest,
i
submit,
i
emphasize
does
not
need
that
the
judge
has
to
substitute
his
judgment.
all
that
means
is
that
as
in
a
dozen
other
different
contexts
that
federal
district
court
judges
face,
he
has
to
pass
upon
the
fundamental
reasonableness
of
the
transaction.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
a
court
i
believe
in
passing
upon
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict,
passing
upon
a
directed
verdict--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
yes,
i
believe
that.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that’s
correct.
doesn’t
a
judge
at
that
point
mr.
chief
justice
have
to
weigh
whether
or
not
it
would
be
unreasonable
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that’s
correct
in
the
minds
of
the,
in
the
minds
of
a
reasonable
juror,
isn’t
that
a
standard
that’s
incorporated
under
the
case
law?
it’s
not
in
the
federal
rule
but
under
the
case
law?
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it’s
a
very
difficult
question,
but
let
me
try
to
respond
it
in
two
levels.
first
it
is
hotly
contested
in
this
case
whether
or
not
the
judge
allowed
a
sufficient
amount
of
discovery
to
go
forward
to
pass
upon
the
question
of
the
independence
and
good
faith
of
the
directors.
the
judge
we
think
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
know
it
is
but
you
asked
i
think
two
questions;
one
what
would
the
district
court
judge
have
to
do
in
terms
of
the
record
and
two
what
we
have
to
do
in
terms
of
satisfying
the
reasonableness
standard.
in
terms
of
the
record
the
first
determination
you’d
have
to
make
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
sufficient
record
before
him
to
pass
upon
the
reasonableness
of
the
directors'
actions.
i
think
that
there
are
two
views
on
that.
the
respondents
would
urge
--
i’m
sorry
the
petitioners
would
urge
that
the
district
court
judge
too
closely
circumscribed
their
ability
to
seek
discovery
on
the
question
of
the
merits
of
the
action.
i
believe
that
a
district
court
judge
in
looking
at
the
discovery
that
was
permitted
may
find
that
adequate
discovery
was
had,
but
the
district
court
judge
in
his
sound
discretion
would
have
to
determine
that.
i
do
not
see
and
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
a
district
court
judge
would
have
to
conduct
there
after
a
full
trial
on
the
merits.
there
should
still
be
of
a
proceeding
that
is
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
court
judge
to
tailor.
now,
the
one,
but
there
is
nothing
magic
in
elocution
of
reasonableness.
we
didn’t
go
through
the
opinion
as
did
the
responders.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
no.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
agree
that’s
--
under
the
state
law
claim,
it’s
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that’s
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that’s
right.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
‘if
so’
is
no.
the
second
question
is
no,
but
let
me
get
to
the
first.
that
first
question
goes
to
the
heart
of
our
concern
with
the
district
court’s
opinion.
the
district
court
judge
while
purporting
to
evaluate
good
faith
in
independence
and
as
i
say
there
is
no
magic
to
finding
the
word
‘reasonable’
in
the
opinion,
but
purporting
to
focus
on
good
faith
in
independence
specifically
said
that
he
wasn’t
going
to
concern
himself
one
with
the
merits
of
the
action.
he
said
he
wasn’t
even
going
to
let
the
merits
of
the
action
color
his
decision.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
we
think
that
he
at
least,
at
least
has
to
a
look
at
the
merits.
i
mean
he
at
least
has
to
consider
whether
in
view
of
what
the
apparent
merits
of
the
action
are,
under
any
formulation
the
tannenbaum
test,
the
kaufmann
test,
the
cramer
test,
the
(inaudible)
test
whatever
formulation
of
all
our
three-prong
test
test
you
want
to
use,
then
he
has
to
pass
on
reasonables.
if
this
court,
if
this
district
court
judge
some
place
in
his
opinion
had
said
and
in
addition
to
looking
at
whether
or
not
these
directors
were
independent
and
whether
or
not
they
had
all
this
information
the
judge
fuld
produced
for
us,
we
also
gave
some
considerations
to
the
merits
of
this
action
as
they
were
expatiated
on
in
judge
fuld’s
memo,
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
case.
but
he
specifically
in
at
least
two
different
places
said,
“i’m
going
to
consider
the
merits
of
this
action
and
they’re
not
going
to
color
my
judgment.”
that’s
his
words,
they’re
not
going
to
color.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
had
it
--
it
depends
upon
how
you
view
the
good
faith
requirement
of
delaware
law.
i’m
not
even
sure
under
delaware
law
that
if
a
district
court
judge
is
asked
to
pass
upon
the
good
faith
of
disinterested
directors
or
independent
directors
of
the
non
(inaudible)
company,
he
disregards
the
merits
completely
that
he
can
met
that
good
faith
standard
but
that’s
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
remember
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it’s
an
issue
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
would
--
it’s
an
issue
in
this
case
only
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
try
to
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it
is
and
under
delaware
law,
well
i
have
not
researched
the
delaware
cases,
we
would
submit
that
within
the
notion
of
good
faith
under
delaware
law
there
has
to
be
some
consideration
given
to
the
merits.
not
a
full
trial,
not
what
mr.
justice
powell
is
concerned
with
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
district
court
judge
found
they
acted
in
good
faith.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
but
he
did
that
without
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
delaware
law
test
is
good
faith
but
how?
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
issue
is
whether
in
determining
that
they
acted
in
good
faith,
you
can
make
that
determination
completely
divorced
at
the
merits
of
the
actions
and
irrespective
of
whether
you’ve
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
if
they
are
very
badly
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
when
you
put
it
that
way
though,
this
is
the
box
that
we
get
in.
if
let’s
say,
it
is
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i’m
sorry
you
are
right
the
box
that
i
get
into,
is
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
an
investment
company
and
the
disinterested
directors
of
an
investment
company,
unfortunately
you
may
have
to
go
that
one
extra
step
because
of
36(a)
it
prescribes
unreasonable
conduct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
absolutely
and
again
on
the
penumbra
of
question
i
agree
there
is
a
variety
of
sections
which
impact
upon
this,
but
penumbra
doesn’t,
i
don’t
think
appropriately
categorized,
i’m
sorry
characterize
36(a)
that
talks
in
terms,
at
least
in
the
house
and
senate
reports
of
unreasonableness.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
they
might
be.
it’s
a
--
mr.
justice
stevens
it’s
a
very
--
recall,
you
know
there’s
--
that
famous,
i
guess
famous
in
the
private
bar
and
the
government
bar
footnote
11
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
green
against
santa
fe
and
that
footnote
in
distinguishing
or
explaining
what
this
court
perceived
the
reach
of
rule
10(b)
5
and
section
10(b)
was,
you
said
this
is
a
lot
different
than
section
206
of
the
investment
advisors
act.
you
said
there
this
is
what,
these
are
words
of
this
court,
you
said
there
federal
fiduciary
principles
were
being
applied
and
section
206
of
the
advisors
act
although
the
companion
statute
of
the
investment
company
act
says
nothing
about
fiduciary
duties.
i
mean
this
is
hardcore
federal
fiduciary
principles
in
section
36(a).
thank
you
very
much
i’m
sorry
for
