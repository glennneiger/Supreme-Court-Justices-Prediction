chief

e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
burks
against
lasker.
mr.
pollack
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
action
was
taken
by
a
quorum,
a
lawful
quorum
of
the
board,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whose
quote
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
sense
would
you
say
it’s
analogous
to
the
law
which
permits
six
members
of
this
court
to
sit
as
a
quorum
and
if
six
members
are
here
for
although
minority
less
than
majority
of
the
full
court
and
make
a
binding
holding
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
six
but
a
four,
if
those
six
decides
something
isn’t
that
holding
in
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
may
be
regarded
as
less
significant
at
sometime
in
the
future
when
on
the
context
to
that
particular
decision
it
makes
the
law
of
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ferrara.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
no
problem
about
any
of
those
things
in
this
case
on
basis
of
the
majority?
there
is
full
compliance
whether
or
whether
they
are
applicable
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn't
need
--
you
wouldn't
need
to
the
congress
to
tell
a
state
court
that,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now
since
you
emphasize
that
section
so
much
and
what
the
congress
intended,
it's
certainly
not
unimportant
and
this
is
in
your
own
brief
of
page
21,
the
statement
from
the
legislative
history
that
it
is
not
intended
by
the
statute
to
shift
the
responsibility
from
managing
an
investment
company
in
the
best
interest
of
the
shareholders
from
the
directors
of
such
company
to
the
judiciary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
have
to
thins
out
this
gloss
a
little
bit,
doesn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
making
the
district
judge
a
super
director,
you
spoke
of
a
super
fiduciary,
you
are
making
him
a
super,
super
fiduciary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
looks
like
just
one
of
them,
we
had
one
this
morning.
we
know
that
that’s
quite
right
in
other
context
judges
do.
but
they
usually
can
trace
the
exercise
of
their
review
to
some
specific
source
that
is
the
fourth
amendment,
the
reasonableness
of
a
search.
can
you
suggest
any
places
where
the
judge
does
this
without
being
able
to
trace
it
to
some
specific
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
other
person
should
take
the
first
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
judgment
nov?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you’ve
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
evidence
supports
the
verdict?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
a
weighing
of
evidence
and
not
a
weighing
of
the
reasonableness
i
submit
to
you.
well,
we’ve
exploited.
so
thank
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
einstein.
i
want
to
relieve
your
anxiety.
we
will
not
charge
mr.
ferrara’s
overtime
to
you
because
we
were
largely
responsible
for
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
suggesting
that
this
was
negligence
that
was
so
gross
as
to
arise
to
the
level
of
the
breach
of
trust.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
it
was
utterly
stupid
to
do
what
they
did
or
failed
to
do
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
there
at
1
o’clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
not
under
delaware
law
majority
action
here
by
a
quorum
of
the
directors.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that’s
the
law
of
delaware,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don't
have
any
of
those
hypotheticals,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
citations
you
gave
i
think
some
of
us
were
not
aware
that
you’re
referring
non-cited
cases,
so
give
me
the
supreme
court
cites
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pollack.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
it’s
still
functioning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
the
number
of
the
footnote?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
