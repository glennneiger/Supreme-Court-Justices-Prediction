justice
william
h.
rehnquist
chief,
i'm
not
through.
you
gave
me
one
other
case
to
announce.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
scott
against
illinois
which
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
right
to
counsel
is
established
in
argersinger
against
hamlin
seven
years
ago
should
be
extended.
in
argersinger,
we
held
that
an
indigent
may
not
be
imprisoned
unless
at
his
trial
he
was
afforded
the
right
of
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
state's
expense.
since
that
time,
there's
been
some
difference
among
state
courts
and
in
some
of
the
other
federal
courts
as
to
whether
argersinger
fully
defined
the
right
to
appointed
counsel
or
whether
there
might
be
other
circumstances
where
the
state
might
be
required
to
appoint
counsel,
such
as
when
imprisonment
is
an
authorized
penalty
under
statute
but
not
actually
imposed
on
the
defendant
in
question.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted,
an
illinois
of
shoplifting
merchandise
value
that
less
than
$150.
he
was
fined
$50
after
a
trial
before
a
judge
but
was
not
imprisoned.
he
argued
in
this
case
that
because
imprisonment
is
a
possible
penalty
for
shoplifting
in
illinois,
the
state
should
have
been
required
to
provide
him
with
an
attorney
at
the
state's
expense
even
though
he
was
not
sentenced
to
any
imprisonment.
the
illinois
supreme
court
rejected
his
claim.
it
held
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
was
not
warranted
by
this
court's
opinion
in
argersinger.
and
we
granted
certiorari
in
order
to
resolve
the
conflicting
views
on
the
meaning
of
that
opinion
and
of
the
right
to
counsel
claim.
today,
we
agree
with
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
our
1972
opinion
in
argersinger
against
hamlin
did
indeed
set
the
limits
of
the
accused
indigent's
right
to
counsel.
we
think
that
imprisonment
is
so
severe
of
sanction
that
it
warrants
special
status
for
sixth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
purposes.
the
actual
imprisonment
line
drawn
in
argersinger
has
proved
reasonably
workable
whether
there's
any
extension
we
believe
would
create
confusion
and
imposed
unpredictable
and
necessarily
substantial
cause
on
50
quite
diverse
states.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution
require
only
that
no
indigent
criminal
defendant
be
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
unless
the
state
has
afforded
him
the
right
to
assistance
of
appointive
counsel
in
his
defense.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
is
accordingly
affirmed.
mr.
justice
powell
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens
joined.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
