mr.
frey
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
if
this
were
a
state
facility
the
cause
of
action
would
be
brought
under
1983
i
would
suppose.
have
you
given
any
thought
to
what's
the
source
of
the
cause
of
action
that's
asserted
in
this
case?
i
know
that's
not
really
your
responsibility,
but
i'm
just
interested
in
your
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
agree
these
issues
are
properly
raisable
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
struck
me,
it's
somewhat
anomalous.
i
was
trying
to
think
it
through
myself,
i
didn't
know
the
government
had
a
position
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
the
standard
that
you
suggest
one
that
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
a
particular
type
of
treatment
really
had
to
be
classified
as
punishment
then
that
would
violate
the
due
process
clause,
it
didn't
have
to
be
cruel
and
unusual,
but
just
as
long
as
--
justice

paul

mrs.
bamberger,
how
can
cost
or
inconvenience
have
anything
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
the
particular
condition
is
punishment
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
either
its
punishment
or
not
if
it
is
punishment
seems
to
me
they
concede
that
they
have
to
spend
what
ever
money
is
necessary
to
remove
the
punishment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
why
are
we
fighting
about
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
rooms
rectangular
in
shape,
i
think
some
these
facilities
have
triangular
rooms,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
two
related
questions?
first
i
am
not
clear,
the
regulations
that
are
challenged
here,
were
they
just
for
the
new
york
institution
or
are
they
the
nationwide
regulation
for
the
bureau
of
prison,
that
was
my
first
question.
let
me
give
you
the
second
you
can
answer
both
together.
the
second
question
is
the
strip
search
problem;
does
the
record
show
that
every
time
there
is
a
visit
to
an
inmate
there
is
a
strip
search
or
is
it
done
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
every
single
time
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
yes
in
another
words,
tell
meâ€¦
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
strip
search
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
government
quoted
some
witness
that
said
diametrically
the
contrary,
said
yes
it
could
be?
