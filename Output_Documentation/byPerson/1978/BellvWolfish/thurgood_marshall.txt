justice
thurgood
marshall

question
i
thought
my
brother
is
do
you
agree
that
there
is
habeas
for
conditions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
one
way
would
be
if
we
rule
against
you
then
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
call
it
incarceration?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it's
not
punishment
what
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
move
them
to
state
facility
in
new
york,
they're
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
bunk
bed
is
punishment
because
if
so
i'm
going
to
apologize
to
my
sons.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
would
i
not
be
obliged
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean
he
couldn't
move?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
because
of
his
size,
if
that
wouldn't
have
big
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
might
be
cruel
when
you
put
me
in
with
an
another
guy
of
my
size.
but
how
about
225
pound
fellows,
is
it
is
that
punishment
for
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
room,
this
size
room
and
they
225
pound
guys
in
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
they
can
move
around
in
that
room.
justice
thurgood
marshall
regardless
of
their
size.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
wall
shrunk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
private
toilet
for
use?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
untrue.
my
whole
point
is
i
understand
the
government's
position
is
that
they
weren't
permitted
it
to
show
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
anything
but
close
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
would
you
do
in
the
mean
time
while
you
are
building
a
new
facility?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
new
facility
available?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
don't
feel
the
government
will
show
anything
when
the
court
case
was
issued
that
two
people
in
one
cell
is
bad
and
denial
of
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
they
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
doesn't
that
may
require
a
new
institution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
you
require
another
institution
or
turn
them
loose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
else
would
you
handle
on
this
--?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
bamberger
please
don't
push
to
point
that
it's
moot
because
if
it
is
moot,
joint
junction
is
wrong.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
want
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr
frey,
were
the
government
denied
the
right
to
put
on
testimony?
