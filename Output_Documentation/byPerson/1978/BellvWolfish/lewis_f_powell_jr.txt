are
the
people
being
held
because
the
--
they
either
were
not
allowed
to
put
up
bail
or
couldn't
do
it;
those
have
been
indicted
for
felonies
or
are
there
some
people
charged
with
misdemeanors?

ms.
bamberger
if
you
are
finished
responding
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
would
like
to
ask
a
question.
you
emphasized
privacy,
does
that
mean
that
you
would
take
the
same
position
if
the
room
were,
say
the
size
of
ordinary
double
room
in
a
small
town
hotel
with
twin
beds.
do
you
object
to
the
fact
that
two
people
in
the
same
room?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
are
the
dimensions
of
these
cells?
i
know
they
are
in
the
record
but
i
can't
put
my
hand
on.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
what
are
the
dimensions?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
30
feet
long
and
how
many
feet
wide?
i
thought
i
saw
some
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
are
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
relying
on
the
chief
justice
or
the
record?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
opposite
to
bunks?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
the
toilet
opposite
to
bunks?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
far
is
the
mattress
on
the
top
bunk
from
the
ceiling?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
thought
you
knew
because
you
said
that
one
couldn't
turn
over
and
one
couldn't
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
the
cold
air
is
what
prevents
one
from
turning
over?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
wide
are
the
bunks?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
so
bunks
3
feet
wide
in
a
room
7.5
feet
wide
would
leave
4.5
feet
and
you
said
that
the
people
couldn't
pass
each
other?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
square
feet
wouldn't
necessarily
affect
the
width
of
a
room,
it
would
depend
on
how
they
were
structured?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
my
point
is
you
were
saying
that
they
couldn't
pass
each
other?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
will
be
tight
but
your
math
is
little
different
from
that
and
perhaps
you
are
right.
