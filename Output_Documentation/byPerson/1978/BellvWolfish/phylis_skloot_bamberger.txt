mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
application
of
the
compelling
interest
test
as
the
appropriate
standard
for
determining
the
rights
of
pretrial
detainees
ignores
the
historically
legal
context
of
that
standard
and
indeed
the
very
facts
of
this
case.
furthermore
the
government
misconstrues
the
second
circuit's
test.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
fundamental
right
of
a
pretrial
detainee
not
to
be
punished.
this
right
persists
even
though
the
pretrial
detainee
is
placed
in
custody
to
assure
his
appearance
in
court
at
the
time
of
trial.
this
fact
of
detention
has
not
constitutionally
been
considered
punishment,
because
the
eighth
amendment
permits
bail
and
by
inference
permits
custody
in
lieu
of
bail
in
order
to
assure
the
appearance
of
the
defendant
for
trial.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
double-bunking
as
the
district
judge
saw
it
and
found
it,
it's
an
incentive
punishment
because
it
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
assure
the
appearance
of
the
defendant
at
trial
and
for
the
security
of
the
institution,
which
are
the
only
two
factors
which
can
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
condition
of
confinement
that
is
above
and
beyond
the
fact
of
incarceration
is
punishment.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
we
have
to
look
at
the
particular
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
are
you
talking
about
normal
military
condition?
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
your
honor
there's
a
vast
distinction
between
the
governmental
purpose
in
the
military
context
and
the
governmental
purpose
here.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
oh!
no
your
honor,
indeed
we're
not.
we
are
saying
that
overcrowding
which
was
in
part
caused
by
double-bunking
in
this
case
on
the
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
well
there
would
have
been
no
overcrowding
if
there
had
been
no
double-bunking.
the
government
has
never
indicated
on
the
facts
of
this
case
inability
to
comply
with
the
district
court's
order.
they
have
been
in
compliance
for
two
years
without
a
single
request
for
a
stay,
without
returning
to
the
court
for
relief
from
the
order
prohibiting
double
bunking.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
okay,
we
defined
it,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
as
the
district
court
saw
it
and
as
he
made
findings,
we
have
two
people
housing
a
cell,
which
the
judge
found
was
built
for
one.
the
results
of
this
housing
of
two
people
in
a
cell
built
for
one
was
that
there
was
a
very
small
space
for
movement
of
the
two
people.
he
looked
at
it
and
he
saw
there
was
very
narrow
aisle.
secondly,
it
requires
urination
and
defecation
in
the
close
presence
of
the
other
person
with
the
resulting
discomforts
which
the
judge
described
in
his
opinion.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
i
think,
i
think
your
honor
that
is
a
point
which
can
be
easily
explained.
the
government's
compelling
interest
in
wartime
is
far
different
from
the
government's
compelling
interest
as
it
exists
with
a
detention
of
presumptively
innocent
detainees.
the
purpose
of
the
war
time
confinement
was
to
create
a
fighting
unit
which
could
defend
the
government
which
could
defend
this
country.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
indeed
your
honor
and
the
conditions
of
confinement
in
a
military
camp
even
in
normal
times
can
be
justified
by
the
government
because
of
the
government's
need
to
create
a
unified
fighting
force,
capable
of
taking
orders
and
directions
and
indeed
in
wartime
conditions
leaving
under
a
very
severe
restrictions
and
conditions.
that's
not
true
here.
the
government's
compelling
interest
is
limited
to
making
sure
that
the
individual
shows
up
for
court
and
for
protecting
the
security
of
the
institution
and
the
government
does
not
claim
and
indeed
it
never
has
that
overcrowding
by
double-bunking
in
this
case
is
justified
by
anything
other
than
cost
and
convenience.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no
that's
not.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
connection
in
this
case
your
honor
is
that
the
conditions
which
were
imposed
resulted
in
a
severe
loss
of
the
privacy
and
dignity
as
the
judge
found
on
this
specific
facts
in
this
case.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
but
they
are
all
admittedly
limitations.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
they
all
are
in
limitations
and
that's
why
this
is
not
a
per
se
case.
that's
why
in
every
case
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
might
very
well
be
true
your
honor,
but
this
is
an
imposed
condition,
a
condition
imposed
by
the
government.
also
in
a
free
atmosphere
the
individual
would
be
free
to
pick
himself
and
go
to
up
and
go
to
one
other
street
or
take
a
bus
or
go
to
a
museum
or
a
library.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
we
do
concede
that,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
they
are
confined
to
this
very
small
space.
we
can
go
--
the
judgment
further
than
just
looking
at
the
single
cells
with
the
exposed
toilet
and
the
excretory
functions
performed
in
the
presence
of
another
and
the
use
of
the
bunk
bed
which
on
one
wall
causes
cold
air
to
blow
in
on
the
persons
sleeping
on
the
top
bunk
so
that
his
freedom
of
movement
is
restricted
and
if
you
shifted
to
the
bunk
bed
to
the
opposite
wall,
one
end
of
the
bed
would
be
blocking
the
window.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
they
did
put
a
blanket
on
it
and
what
the
judge
found
was
it
a
result
of,
as
a
result
of
that
the
ventilation
system
was
not
functioning
properly.
so
they
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
we
are
not
urging
that
its
if,
it
should
be
a
spa,
my
urging
is
that
in
these
conditions
on
these
facts
the
individuals
were
deprived
and
the
judge
found
if
minimal
privacy
and
dignity
the
court
of
appeals
agrees.
excuse
me
your
honor.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
you
would
except
if
you
lived
in
a
room
like
this
where
if
he
slept
in
the
top
bunk
he
would
be
unable
to
move
when
if
he
slept
in
the
bottom
bunk
with
the
bunk
bed
in
the
room
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
because
the
air-dent
will
let
cold
the
air
right
across
the
top
of
the
inmates
body
on
the
top
bunk
bed
so
that
his
movement
was
restricted,
he
couldn't
lift
his
legs,
he
couldn't
turn
over,
he
couldn't
prop
himself
up
against
the
wall
because
his
body
was
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no
way
it
would
be
because
your
honor.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
it
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it
would
be
if
they
couldn't
move
in
the
room.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
we're
free
to
leave
this
room.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
we
would
but
the
judge
found
that
they
couldn't
move
around
in
that
room.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
regardless
of
their
size.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no
it
meant
that
after
there
was
the
desk
and
the
two
chairs
which
the
second
chair
had
to
be
put
in
because
there
was
a
second
person
and
the
bunk
bed
that
the
room,
that
the
aisle
was
too
narrow
for
them
to
move
around
that
they
couldn't
leave
each
others
company
in
any
way
that
they
were
forced
to
remain
together
all
the
time
in
that
within
one
inches,
within
few
inches
of
each
other
they
have
to
use
the
toilet
facility
and
that
when
if
the
bed
was
not
placed
on
the
wall
with
the
vent,
it
would
be
placed
on
the
opposite
wall
where
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger

but
the
private
toilet,
how
the
private
existed
in
this
case
was
that
there
was
no
room
for
the
person
not
using
the

to
remove
himself
from
in

â€“
for
any

or
perhaps
to

ms.

that
your

is
not
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
record
in
this
case
disputes
that.
the
government
filed
several
sets
of
affidavits.
i
believe
what
the
government
is
contesting
in
this
case
is
that
they
were
not
given
the
opportunity
to
present
their
cost
and
justification,
cost
and
inconvenience
justifications.
as
a
matter
of
law
if
the
fundamental
right,
not
to
be
punished
is
infringed
upon
here
by
this
--
by
the
conditions
of
confinement,
cost
and
inconvenience
are
simply
legally
irrelevant.
even
under
the
government's
enhanced
scrutiny
test
caused
an
inconvenience,
cannot
be
the
sole
fact.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
--
that
question
doesn't
come
up
here
because
the
government
has
never
asserted
that
a
new
facility
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
government's
never
asserted
the
need
for
one.
here
on
appeal
in
the
district
court
the
government
has
the
right.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
but
they
didn't
say
that.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
court
said
that
with
a
functional
unit
system
which
was
used
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
for
this
institution,
the
inmate's
could,
the
institutions
could
not
service
a
population
which
was
in
excess
of
the
population
for
which
the
institution
was
built,
449.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no
it
doesn't
require
a
new
institution.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
not
on
this
record,
there
is
no
indication
of
that.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
government
handled
it
simply
by
removing
from
the
institution
those
inmates
who
were
serving
their
sentences
but
were
kept
at
the
institutions
as
part
of
a
workforce
for
the
government's
own
convenience.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
that
the
government
has
been
in
compliance
with
the
court's
full
order
on
overcrowding
since
august
28
1978.
and
they
have
never
returned
to
the
court
with
proof,
with
assertions,
with
facts
which
would
indicate
that
they
are
incapable
of
maintaining
that
and
in
fact
they
conceded
in
their
briefs
that
they
are
capable
of
maintaining
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
as
far
as
i
understand,
that
has
to
be
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
the
government
says
that
they
should
be
relieved
of
the
obligations
because
the
situation
may
come
up
again.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
they
are
no
longer
keeping
custody
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
i
think
your
honor
with
all
due
respect
has
to
ask
the
government,
whether
their
statement
in
their
brief
that
they
intent
overcrowded
if
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
exactly
your
honor
but
the
point
is
that
is
the
government
didn't
seek
a
stay
of
the
double-selling
or
the
overcrowding
double-selling
order
they
never
have.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
there
are
two
more
factors
involved
here.
first
they
have
never
returned
to
the
district
court
claiming
impossibility
or
that
they
have
to
construct
a
new
institution
or
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
change
in
facts
which
requires
them
to
be
relieved
of
their
obligations
under
the
order.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
what.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
that's
correct
but
it's
the
government
position
here
that
leaves
it
open
to,
because
they
say
that
if
they
need,
if
they
say
if
they
are,
if
they
have
a
lot
of
prisoners
again
that
they
would
put
them
in
any
institution
convicted,
non-convicted,
pre
trail
whatever
it
may
be.
the
other
fact
is
that
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no
i'm
not
pushing
that
it's
moot,
[attempt
to
laughter]
what
i'm
urging
your
honor.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i'm
urging
your
honor
is
that
we
have
a
situation
here
which
the
government
claims
as
capable
of
repetition
and
we
are
urging
that
this
order
is
proper
on
that
assertion.
to
return
to
the
question
of
the
government's
compliance
the
district
court
included
in
its
order
a
provision
which
would
permit
the
warden
of
the
institution
to
certify
that
he
needed
to
overcrowd
because
of
an
emergency
or
immediate
severe
overcrowding.
the
government
has
never
availed
itself
of
that
portion
of
the
order.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it
doesn't
have
to
go
to
the
court.
it
just
has
to
file
a
copy
of
it
own
certification
with
the
court.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
its
position
is
that
but
even
though
that
order
is
in
effect
now.
the
prohibition
on
overcrowding
is
in
effect
now.
while
the
case
is
before
this
court
they
haven't
used
that
remedy.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
no
we
are
not
asserting
that
the
case
is
moot.
we
are
just
saying
that
there
is
no
factual
assertion
in
this
record
for
the
government's
justification
that
caused
an
inconvenience,
permit
the
overcrowded
housing
that
existed
in
this
facility
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
tried.
that
those
conditions,
those
justifications
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
that's
the
government's
theory
and
i
don't
understand
that
because
if
it's
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that's
exactly
the
point.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
with
that
i
will
move
on
to
one
additional
issue
--[laughter]
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
there
have
been
decisions
which
i
don't
have
in
my
head
at
this
moment
your
honor
in
the
florida
and
california
federal
courts
involving
capital
punishment
sanction
in
which
those
cases
decided
the
issues
based
upon
class
action
status.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
believe
your
honor
that
they
were
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
habeas
corpus
has
been
used
by
the
courts
and
the
second
circuit.
for
instance,
i
cite
saw
sostre
against
mcginnis,
to
release
an
individual
not
necessarily
from
full
custody,
but
from
those
conditions
which
are
unconstitutional.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
say
i
believe
that
there
are
cases
which
i
will
be
happy
to
supply
to
the
court
with.
one
additional
fact
which
the
court
considered
in
the
over
crowding
issue
which
was
the
entire
set
up
of
the
functional
unit
system
where
inmates
had
to
spend
virtually
23
hours
of
every
day
in
that
one
functional
unit
and
mr.
frey
described
for
the
court
that
it
meant
that
the
inmates
were
confined
to
this
area
for
virtually
all
activities.
now
what
the
judge
found
was
that
the
institution
couldn't
supply
the
activities
which
these
multi-purpose
functional
unit
rooms
were
supposed
to
supply
because
of
the
overcrowding
and
this
resulted
in
a
rate
down
in
the
functioning
of
the
institution.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
think
that
would
present
a
more
difficult
case
because.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
because
the
conditions
in
the
room,
the
denial
of
privacy,
the
cold
air
blowing
into
the
vent,
the
presence
of
the
exposed
toilet
would
still
exist.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
if
that
was
the
architects
plan
i
would
submit
that
the
court
could
disregard
the
architects
plan
just
as
though
just
as
the
court
could
consider
it
as
an
element
in
deciding
whether
the
room
was
appropriate
for
housing
more
than
one
person.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that's
correct
and
indeed
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
itself
has
presented
testimony
in
cases
which
would
indicate
that
50
square
feet
is
the
minimum
required
per
inmate
in
a
cell
in
order
to
give
him
adequate
movement
space,
adequate
psychological
space.
that
testimony
is
cited
in
campbell
against
mcgruder
by
the
dc
circuit.
the
draft
standards
proposed
by
the
justice
department
indicate
that
the
space
which
was
provided
per
inmate
in
this
double-celling
overcrowded
situation
is
inadequate.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
don't
think
that
they
are
absorbed
into
the
constitution,
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
are
valid
evidence
which
can
be
considered,
expert
evidence
from,
in
the
case
of
the
government
drafted
standards
it's
own
correctional
officials,
which
would
indicate
what
they
believe
to
be
adequate
and
i
think
that
is
evidence
which
the
district
court
considered
and
which
is
appropriate
to
consider
in
making
an
evaluation.
it's
the
same
ways
in
the
medical
case,
doctor's
assertions
are
not
constitutional
principles,
but
they
are
valid
evidence
in
determining
what
is
the
proper
legal
standard
to
apply.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no
sir,
there
is
no
objection
to
that
and
the
record
doesn't
present
that
in
this
case.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
they
are
about
75
square
feet.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it's
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
they
are
in
a
supplement
appendix,
(voice
overlap)
excuse
me
your
honor.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that's
right.[laughter]
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
approximately
10
x
7.5.[laughter]
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yeah,
well
i
think
he
is
good
authority
[laughter].
now
in
this
room
the
toilet
juts
about
2
feet
in
to
the
center
of
the
room,
so
that
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i'm
sorry.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
it's
not
exactly
opposite
because
it
is
in
to
the
middle
of
the
room
so
that
if
the
bunk
bed
were
on
the
side
where
the
toilet
juts
out
towards
the
bottom
bunk
would
be
just
inches
from
the
toilet
and
the
other
end
of
the
bed
would
be
at
the
window.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
fact
is
not
in
the
record
your
honor.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no
it
wasn't
the
ceiling
height
your
honor,
that
was
significant,
it
was
the
height
of
the
ventilations,
the
vent
which
supplied
the
air
that
went
in
and
out
of
the
room.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that's
right.
it's
about
one
foot
above
the
body
level
of
the
--
of
a
person
lying
on
the
bed.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
there
is
only
one
piece
of
evidence
in
the
record
which
would
indicate
that
and
that
was
one
of
our
experts
who
testified
that
the
bunks
were
6
feet
by
3
feet.
they
are
6
feet
long
by
3
feet
wide.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
the
aisle
is,
the
judge
found
that
was
approximately
30
square
feet
in
width,
i'm
sorry
34
square
feet
so
it
would
be
4,
if
it
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no
that's
correct,
so
if
it
would
tender
it
would
be
3
foot.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
it's
about
3
feet
wide,
the
width
of
the
aisle
that
was
left
in
the
room.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
in
any
case
the
judge
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
space
would
make
it
very
crowded
and
very
difficult
to
move
about.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
they
are
--
no
they
are
not
triangular,
they're
irregular
because
of
the
way
the
fixtures
for
plumbing
and
electricity
cut
into
the
room.
these
are
all
in
an
exhibit
one
to
the
government's
9(g)
statement
and
they
are
exhibits
before
the
court.
and
so
the
scheme
of
the
room
with
the
placement
of
the
articles
it's
in
there.
the
government
also
relies
upon
a
distortion
of
the
second
circuit's
case
to
make
its
argument
here.
the
second
circuit
said,
â€œ
that
even
though
there
was
a
compelling
interest
not
to
be
punished
by
conditions
which
were
more
severe
than
necessary
in
order
to
justify
appearance
in
court
and
the
security
of
the
institution,
the
particular
intrusion
imposed
by
the
government
had
to
effect
--
had
to
be
a
substantial
intrusion,
so
that
even
the
application
of
the
second
circuit's
compelling
interest
test
would
leave
the
government
enormous
amounts
of
room
in
which
to
function
without
returning
to
the
court
each
time
it
had
to
make
a
decision.
and
indeed
that
is
what
judge
kaufman
said
in
his
opinion
on
page
2a
of
the
petition,
certiorari
petition
appendix.
judge
kaufman
says
twice
that
the
intrusions
must
be
substantial
ones
and
i
think
that
that
the
government
fears
about
a
returning
to
court
for
every
time
they
have
something
to
do
which
is
simply
unfounded.
there
are
four
other
issues
which
were
presented
to
this
court
by
the
government,
the
question
of
the
anal
and
genital
cavity
perusals
after
each
visit
--
i
believe
my
time
is
upâ€¦
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
sorry,
anal
and
genital
cavity
perusals
after
every
visit
in
a
context
of
enormous
security
precautions,
searches,
strip
searches
which
required
the
inmate
to
completely
disrobe.
the
second
issue
presented
by
the
government
relates
to
the
total
prohibition
on
all
written
material
to
all
inmates
in
the
institution
except
those
coming
from
the
publisher.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
is
true,
but
the
district
court
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
they
were
less
restrictive,
not
so
overboard
measures
which
could
control
that.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
your
honor
and
in
fact
the
district
court
completely
disowned
that
responsibility
as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
they
found
inappropriate
as
overboard
only
the
most
extreme
measures
imposed
by
the
government.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
oh!
yes,
but
the
court
said
they
could
inspect.
what
the
government
was
doing
here
is
that
they
were
totally
prohibiting
it.
we
assured
it
that
they
could
search,
they
could
limit
the
quantity.
they
could
limit
the
amount
that
comes
in
each
month.
they
could
say
only
one,
only
two,
but
they
couldn't
totally
prohibit.
that
was
what
the
courts
were
getting
at,
that
the
restrictions
which
the
government
imposed
were
way
beyond
what
was
needed
to
protect
a
security
interest.
and
based
on
the
evidence
in
large
part
from
the
government's
own
witnesses,
the
courts
below
found
that
their
restrictions
on
first,
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
rights
were
far
more
than
was
necessary
to
protect
the
interest
and
intermediate
interests
or
intermediate
regulations
with
which
involved
less
restrictions,
but
could
nevertheless
protect
the
government's
security
interest
could
be
imposed
and
this
did
not
prevent
the
government
from
using
reasonable
means.
the
choice
was
theirs.
they
could
do
whatever
they
chose
to
do
to
protect
their
interest
as
long
as
the
restriction
that
was
ultimately
found
to
be
used
by
the
government
was
not
so
over
broad
that
it
went
beyond
what
was
necessary
to
protect
the
interest.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it's
done
every
single
time.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
regardless
of
--
notwithstanding
that
the
government
has
enormous
search
processes,
the
strip
search
is
still
required.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
now
with
respect
to
the
nationality
or
the
nationwide
application
of
the
rules;
the
government's
publisher
only
rule
has
national
application
and
indeed
the
government
has
indicated
here
that
they
don't
even
need
that
board
rule,
that
they're
going
to
â€“
now
the
rule.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
am
not
aware
of
the
general
applicability
of
strip
search
or
of
the
other
two.
the
government
drafted
standards
by
the
way
indicate
that
observed
visits
need
not
result
in
anal
and
genital
perusals
in
every
situation
without
cause
and
our
assertion
here
is
that
and
the
record
establishes
beyond
any
doubt
that
these
visits
are
observed.
there
is
a
guard,
a
guard
takes
the
inmates
into
the
visiting
room.
there
is
a
guard
that
constantly
observes
the
visiting
room,
the
lavatories
are
not
available
to
inmates,
a
visitor
using
the
lavatory
needs
to
have
a
key,
there
is
a
door
in
the
lavatory
room,
the
inmates
wear
jumpsuits
and
the
testimony
was
uncontradicted
that
contraband
could
not
be
inserted
while
wearing
those
jumpsuits.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no
well,
the
government
and
we
apparently
have
disputed
to
the
significance
of
that
testimony.
however,
the
district
court
did
make
a
finding
that
these
perusals
were
not
necessary
and
that
they
were
alternative
means
and
that
therefore
i
think
we
can
infer
that
every
fact
which
was
not
found
against
us
was
found
for
us.
the
government
does
not
claim
that
our
interpretation
was
clearly
erroneous.
what
their
witness
was
talking
about
was
the
ability
to
hide
things
orally
and
swallow
them
which
certainly
wouldn't
be
covered
by
anal
and
genital
inspections.
the
question
of
the
total
prohibition
on
property
from
outside
the
institution
is
not
nationally
applied.
thank
you.
