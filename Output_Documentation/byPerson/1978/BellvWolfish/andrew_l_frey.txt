mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
to
review
certain
aspects
of
its
decision
relating
to
conditions
of
confinement
at
the
metropolitan
correctional
center,
a
federally
operated
short-term
custodial
facility
in
new
york
city.
there
are
five
issues
presented
to
you
for
decision.
the
first
and
perhaps
potentially
the
most
significant
from
the
standpoint
of
constitutional
doctrine,
involves
the
constitutionality
of
double-bunking
pretrial
detainees
in
rooms
designed
for
single
occupancy.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
right.
there
are
various
classifications
of
inmates
that
are
kept
at
a
facility
like
the
mcc
in
addition
to
persons
who
are
being
held
in
lieu
of
bail
or
awaiting
trial
in
criminal
charges.
there
is
a
significant
group
of
inmates
who
are
--
have
been
brought
in
on
ad
testificandum
or
ad
prosequendum
writs
to
appear
in
federal
court
proceedings
who
are
prisoners
serving
other
state
or
federal
sentences.
there
are
persons
awaiting
parole
and
probation
revocation
hearings,
and
there
are
sentenced
inmates
whose
sentences
are
such
a
short
duration
that
it
is
deemed
desirable
to
have
them
serve
their
sentence
in
new
york.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
to
the
double-bunking
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct;
they
are
out
of
the
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
group
of
people
that
we're
talking
about
in
connection
with
the
double-bunking
issue
are
people
who
have
been
unable
to
secure
a
release
on
bail.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
is
there
any
difference
in
the
facility?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
it
is
generally
the
same
group
of
people.
actually
there
maybe
some
categories
that
were
kept
at
west
street
and
they
were
shifted
to
other
facilities
when
the
mcc
opened
because
of
the
population
increase
of
people
committed
to
bureau's
custody,
immigration,
deportation
cases
and
others.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
know
the
record.
i
simply
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
was
brought
as
a
habeas
corpus
class
action,
certified
as
a
class
action.
we
have
not
challenged
the
jurisdiction.
we
contested
the
wisdom
of
certifying
a
class
action,
but
that
was
done
and
we
have
not
challenged
that
in
this
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
have
not
focused
my
attention
in
preparing
the
argument
on
that
question.
i
am
not
prepared
to
dispute
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
one
that
i
could
state.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
believe
there
is
some
authority
for
habeas
corpus
class
actions
and
there
have
been
questions
that
have
come
to
our
attention
in
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
connection
with
whether
that
should
be
challenged,
but
to
this
point
we
have
not
sought
to
challenge
the
propriety
of
that,
and
we
don't
do
it
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
correct,
but
i'm
--
well
i'm
generally
familiar
but
i
have
not
refreshed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
haven't
suggested
that
this
court
has,
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
perceive
of
that
as
the
kind
of
threshold
jurisdictional
question
that
you
must
decide
even
though
we
have
not
brought
it
to
you
for
decision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
would
right
and
i'm
not
sure
perhaps
my
colleague
can
answer.
there
maybe
alternative
grounds
such
as
mandamus
for
–
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
my
answer
is
that
we
have
not
asked
this
court
to
overturn
the
judgment
below
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
on
the
grounds
of
any
challenge
to
the
propriety
of
a
class
action
certification
and
i'm
reluctant
to
state
a
position
for
the
government
on
these
issues
without
having
giving
it
a
greater
deal
of
thought.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
class
consists
of
the
total
population
of
inmates
both
sentenced
and
pretrial
detainees.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
that
are
some
internal
conflicts
of
interest
between
these
groups
that
are
--
request
to
have
such
separate
subclasses
certified
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
have
the
whole
population,
but
not
as
to
every
issue.
the
double-bunking
issue,
the
disposition
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
it
reversed
the
district
court's
ban
as
applied
to
sentenced
inmates
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
it
affirmed
as
applied
to
pretrial
detainees
because
it
perceived
that
a
different
legal
standard
was
appropriate
to
judge
the
claim
in
that
context.
there
are
also
four
rules
or
practices
that
are
before
this
court
that
are
justified
on
security
grounds,
the
right
to
receive
packages,
the
so
called
publisher
only
rule,
the
validity
of
visual
inspection
of
body
cavities
after
contact
visits
and
the
right
to
be
present
or
the
inmate
to
present
and
observe
room
searches.
now
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
with
the
exception
of
the
room
search
issue
which
applies
only
to
pretrial
detainees,
no
distinction
was
drawn
on
the
other
three
issues
between
sentenced
inmates
and
pretrial
detainees,
arguably
one
might
be
but
none
has
been.
now
these
five
issues
are
the
rump
contingent
of
a
veritable
army
of
complaints
about
the
operation
of
the
mcc
that
marched
into
the
united
states
district
court
in
november
1975,
less
than
four
months
after
the
mcc
opened.
the
issues
raised
covered
such
diverse
subjects
as
housing,
food,
clothing
of
inmates,
visiting,
library
facilities,
staffing,
educational
and
job
opportunities,
grievance
procedures,
mail,
telephone
service,
noise
levels,
various
aspects
of
the
treatment
of
personal
property
and
many
others,
they're
numerous
to
name
here.
after
initially
resolving
a
few
of
the
issues
on
summary
judgment
including
the
double-bunking
and
the
publisher
only
issue,
the
district
court
conducted
hearings
and
issued
an
extensive
opinion
granting
much
of
the
relief
respondents
sought
and
denying
others
of
their
claims.
the
court
relied
on
both
constitutional
and
statutory
grounds
for
its
decision.
some
of
its
rulings,
the
government
acquiesced
and
others
were
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
turn
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part.
it
rejected
any
statutory
basis
for
the
district
court's
orders
prohibiting
various
mcc
practices
and
conditions,
finding
that
the
case
generally
involved
matters
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law,
and
accordingly
rested
it's
own
ruling
solely
on
constitutional
grounds.
and
as
i've
said
in
setting
forth
the
constitutional
standards
that
distinguish
between
sentenced
inmates
and
pretrial
detainees.
as
to
the
former
challenged
conditions
were
to
be
judged
by
the
eighth
amendment,
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
standard,
the
detainees
--
the
court
relied
on
the
presumption
of
innocence
to
set
a
much
higher
standard.
it
stated
that
pretrial
detainees
maybe
subject
to
“only
those
restrictions
and
privations
which
inhere
in
their
confinement
itself
or
which
are
justified
by
compelling
necessities
of
jail
administration.”
and
it
made
quite
clear
that
challenges
to
conditions
of
confinement
for
detainees
are
to
be
adjudicated
without
consideration
of
either
physical
or
administrative
justifications
for
the
particular
practice.
it
applied
these
standards
for
the
double-bunking
issue
by
in
affect
adopting
a
per
se
rule
that
two
inmates
may
not
be
housed
in
the
room
designed
for
one.
with
regard
to
the
other
issues
that
are
before
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
the
maintenance
of
security
and
order
is
a
compelling
necessity
of
jail
administration,
but
it
nevertheless
concluded
that
the
government
had
failed
to
establish
sufficient
justification
for
the
practices
or
rules
in
question.
now
as
i
indicated
at
the
beginning
the
case
breaks
down
into
two
different
types
of
issues.
the
first
involves
the
standards
by
which
the
due
process
rights
of
pretrial
detainees
are
to
be
evaluated
in
the
context
of
a
challenged
or
alleged
overcrowding
at
the
mcc.
the
second
involves
the
security
related
issues.
now
since
the
first
issue
was
potentially
the
more
novel
and
substantial
constitutional
issue,
i
intend
to
devote
most
or
all
of
my
limited
time
to
that
question
and
to
rely
on
the
briefs
for
the
other
issues.
i'd
like
to
say
a
brief
word
about
the
mcc
itself
before
getting
into
legal
arguments.
it
is
one
of
a
very
limited
number
of
federal
facilities,
specifically
designed
to
house
pretrial
detainees
and
other
short-term
inmates.
as
the
court
of
appeals
described
that
the
mcc
represented
the
architectural
embodiment
of
the
best
and
most
progressive
penological
planning.
the
key
design
element
of
the
mcc
that's
relevant
to
the
double-bunking
issue
and
that
indeed
is
the
central
element
of
the
facility,
is
the
modular
unit
concept.
in
this
concept
there
are
self
contained
residential
units
in
lieu
of
the
traditional
cell
block.
typical
unit
contains
48
rooms,
which
would
join
large
multipurpose
rooms
with
facilities
for
recreation,
education,
exercise,
and
dining.
the
common
areas
are
carpeted,
sleeping
rooms
have
doors
rather
than
bars
and
for
the
virtually
the
entire
day
except
seven
sleeping
hours
between
11
in
night
and
6
in
the
morning
the
inmates
are
free
to
move
about
their
unit
without
restriction.
also
visiting
facilities
are
attached
to
each
of
these
units
rather
than
having
a
central
facility
for
the
institution.
i
understand
that
there
are
slides
in
the
record
with
photographs
of
the
institution
if
you
deem
it
useful
to
get
a
look
at
what
it's
like.
the
mcc
was
designed
to
house
449
inmates,
however
contemporaneous
with
its
opening
in
august
1975,
there
was
a
sharp
and
unexpected
increase
in
the
number
of
persons
committed
to
the
bureau
of
prisoners
custody,
who
the
bureau
determined
had
to
be
or
should
be
housed
at
the
mcc.
because
the
number
of
inmates
exceeded
the
designed
capacity
of
the
institution,
the
bureau
determined
in
order
to
meet
its
custodial
obligations
that
a
number
of
the
rooms
should
be
used
to
house
two
inmates
and
that
bunk
bed
should
replace
single
beds
in
the
dormitory
areas.
accordingly,
bunk
beds
were
installed
in
place
of
single
beds
in
73
of
the
389
residential
rooms
at
the
mcc.
now
the
respondents
have
invoked
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
relied
upon
the
due
process
clause
for
striking
down
the
double
bunking
in
this
case.
the
focus
of
the
issue
therefore
concerns
the
substantive
content
of
that
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
due
process
clause
by
its
own
force
and
without
the
aid
of
any
other
constitutional
provision,
confers
upon
pretrial
detainees
the
right
to
be
free
of
cramped
housing
conditions
in
the
absence
of
a
governmental
showing
of
compelling
necessity.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
they
viewed
it
as
a
liberty
interest
and
we
do
not
dispute
in
this
case
the
pretrial
detainees
retain
those
liberty
interests
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
fact
of
confinement
itself.
we
simply
dispute
that
the
standard
that
was
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
evaluating
the
practices
that
arguably
impinged
upon
those
liberty
interests
was
the
right
standard.
now
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
standard
lacks
any
basis
in
the
constitutional
decisions
of
this
court
dealing
with
the
subject
of
substantive
due
process
and
we
think
that
the
proper
resolution
of
the
issue
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
required
that
the
government
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
adduce
the
factors
that
brought
about
the
challenged
conditions
and
the
propriety
of
the
government's
action
having
to
be
assessed
by
its
reasonableness
in
relation
to
the
legitimate
governmental
objectives
at
stake.
now
two
aspects
of
the
constitutional
backdrop
to
this
issue
are
worth
highlighting.
first,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
conditions
of
confinement
for
both
pretrial
detainees
and
sentenced
inmates
must
meet
minimum
levels
of
decency
with
regard
to
such
consideration
as
housing,
food,
sanitation,
and
medical
care
and
we
have
spelled
out
in
our
brief
the
reasons
for
our
contention
that
these
standards
have
been
fully
satisfied
at
the
mcc.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
constitutionally.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
as
pretrial
detainees
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
has
to
do
with
it
in
the
same
sense
i
think
that
conditions
of
this
kind
can
be
viewed
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eighth
amendment.
we
are
in
agreement
that
pretrial
detainees
cannot
under
the
due
process
clause
be
punished
prior
to
a
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
after
to
conviction,
when
they
see
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
can't
be
punished.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
we
agree.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
you
concluded
that
it
was
punishment
then
it
would
violate
the
due
process
clause.
now
we
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
the
respondent's
argument
that
what
was
involved
in
this
case
was
demonstrated
to
be
punishment.
we
think
the
concept
of
this
punishment
is
they're
using
it
as
a
trivial
or
totalogical
concept.
it's
punishment
because
they
repeatedly
say
it's
punishment,
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
why
do
i
call
incarceration?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
this
is
not
punishment,
its
custody.
it
can
be
incarceration
of
course,
it
can
be
punishment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that's
and
if
that's
the
case
then
the
due
process
clause
allows
punishment
to
the
extent
that
pretrial
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but,
i
think
we
are
getting
into
a
circularity.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
substantial
dispute.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
one
is
questioning
the
validity
of
the
institution
of
pretrial
detention.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
detention
involves
an
impairment
of
a
fundamental
liberty
interest
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
and
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
to
double-bunking
is
clearly
inappropriate
standard
to
apply
to
pretrial
commitment,
and
indeed
the
both
the
constitution
and
the
statutes
require
a
kind
of
least
restrictive
alternative
test
so
that
detention
is
the
last
step
after
you've
excluded
any
other
reasonable
measure
to
assure
presence
at
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
the
purpose
for
which
they're
being
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true.
i
assume,
i
assume
very
few
if
any
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that's
right
because
the
amount
of
bail
is
set
in
the
amount
necessary
to
assure
their
appearance
at
trial,
and
if
they
don't
post
that
amount,
then
it
follows
that
there
has
been
an
determination
that
with
some
lesser
amount
or
personal
recognizance
bond,
their
appearance
at
trial
cannot
be
assured
and
that's
the
reason
why
they
are
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct
but
they
would
have
then
been
deterred
from
fleeing
or
failing
to
appear
by
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
the
--
i
believe
it
is.
we've
citied
section
3146
i
think
in
our
brief
in
terms
of
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
are
consider
--
there
are
considerations
of
a
number
of
alternatives,
money
bail
being
low
down
on
the
list.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
don't
--
i
agree
with
that
i
am
not
sure
what
the
bearing
of
--
i
don't
know
what
the
bearing
of
that
is
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
no
one
is
contesting
the
validity
of
the
institutional
pretrial
detention.
no
one
is
contesting
--
we're
not
contesting
that
a
compelling
necessity
standard
is
appropriate
and
the
respondents
are
not
contesting
that
these
people
can
be
detained.
it's
the
subsidiary
conditions
of
confinement
incidental
to
this
massive
restriction
on
liberty
that's
involved
in
the
detention
that
are
at
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
explain
the
role
that
i
think
punishment
properly
plays
in
this.
when
a
challenge
is
presented
to
a
condition
of
confinement,
the
government
is
obliged
assuming
the
challenge
crosses
some
constitutional
threshold
of
presenting
some
kind
of
claim
of
liberty
interest,
the
government
is
obliged
to
show
in
some
fashion
and
by
some
standard
a
justification
for
the
action
that
it
has
taken,
which
has
impaired
this
interest.
now
the
--
in
the
case
of
a
pretrial
detainee,
the
government
cannot
say,
one
of
the
reasons
we're
doing
this
is
to
punish
them;
or
one
of
the
reasons
that
justifies
this
practice
is
to
rehabilitate
them,
or
to
deter
others
from
committing
the
offense.
those
are
--
those
are
governmental
objectives
that
can
only
be
invoked
to
support
a
condition
of
confinement
in
the
case
of
convicted
inmates.
in
the
case
of
pretrial
detainees,
there
must
be
other
kinds
of
considerations
invoked.
our
concern
in
this
case
is
that
the
very
real
and
substantial
physical
and
administrative
considerations
that
made
it
necessary
to
resort
to
a
degree
of
double-bunking
were
totally
foreclosed
from
consideration
by
the
court
under
a
standard
which
in
effect
said
per
se,
“you
just
can't
put
two
people
in
a
room
that
was
designed
for
one.
we
don't
want
to
hear
why
you're
doing
it.”
now
in
this
connection
there
is
a
lot
of
suggestion
that
physical
considerations
and
administrative
convenience
are
some
how
insubstantial
excuses
that
the
government
makes
up
to
justify
its
practices,
and
that
it's
something
--
administrative
convenience
is
something
like
not
having
to
work
overtime
or
not
having
to
make
modifications
and
establish
routines
and
we
think
administrate
convenience
is
much
more
in
this
context.
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
as
a
certain
population
of
inmates
committed
to
its
custody.
it
has
no
control
over
the
number
of
these
inmates.
it
has
to
house
them.
the
kinds
of
considerations
of
administrative
convenience
which
are
included
in
this,
in
this
concept
involve,
where
are
you
going
to
put
these
people?
if
you
can't
double-bunk
in
the
mcc,
then
a
number
of
people
who
perhaps
should
be
in
new
york
city,
including
and
it
didn't
happen
in
this
case
but
it
could,
pretrial
detainees
will
be
moved
way
from
their
family
and
friends,
away
from
their
lawyers
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
there
too,
we
could
not,
but
this
is
the
kind
of
issue
that
would
have
explored
at
a
trial,
and
it
is
not
simply
administrative
convenience
of
the
administrators
but
encompassed
within
this
rubric
is
the
welfare
of
the
people
committed
to
their
custody
as
a
group
and
when
the
mcc
was
told,
you
can't
double-bunk
anymore,
what
happened
was
that
90
inmates
who
the
bureau
of
prisons
judged
ought
to
be
housed
at
the
mcc
were
sent
off
to
other
facilities,
possibly
more
crowded
or
for
other
reasons
less
suitable
for
them.
now
i
do
want
to
i
think
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
a
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
with
regard
to
the
testimony
of
government
experts
in
other
cases
about
the
amount
of
space
that's
necessary,
the
other
case
was
a
case
that
involved
a
cell
in
which
people
were
locked
for
substantial
portions
of
the
day.
the
central
to
the
concept
of
the
mcc
and
if
there
is
repeating
that
people
are
not
locked
into
their
rooms
except
during
sleeping
hours.
so
the
inconveniences
that
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
of
two
people
being
in
cramped
quarters
and
we
don't
deny
that
the
quarters
are
cramped,
is
an
inconvenience
in
terms
of
forced
togetherness
that
exist
for
a
period
of
relatively
brief
period
and
in
fact
none
of,
essentially
none
of
the
waking
hours
except
when
there
were
certain
times
when
everybody
has
to
go
to
their
rooms
for
a
cell
count.
now
there
was
no
hearing
in
this
case,
not
only
to
hear
the
government's
justifications
for
resorting
to
double-bunking,
but
also
no
hearing
to
examine
the
effect
of
double-bunking
on
the
inmates.
the
only
evidence
that
was
before
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
affidavit
of
the
government
psychiatrist
who
had
examined
the
facility
and
who
concluded
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
that
this
was
emotionally
detrimental
under
the
conditions
that
existed
at
the
mcc.
now
the
response
to
this
is
on
the
part
of
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
large
part
was
we
already
settled
this
in
another
case.
the
other
case
in
which
they
already
settled
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
revealing
error
in
their
original
opinion,
at
page
18
a
of
the
appendix,
they
stated
“inmate
testimony
revealed
that
double
celling
had
produced
numerous
disagreements
over
the
choice
of
activities
within
the
room,
had
spawned
fights,
charges
of
theft,
frequent
involuntary
contact,”
that
was
testimony
as
they
later
amended
the
opinion
in
another
case.
the
other
case
was
a
case
in
which
there
were
40
square
feet
for
two
inmates
instead
of
76
or
77
as
in
this
case.
the
other
case
was
a
case
in
which
the
inmates
were
locked
in
their
room
for
approximately
twice
the
time
that
they
were
in
this
case.
the
other
case
was
the
conventional
cell
block
kind
of
jail.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
summary
judgment
was
granted
against
us.
we
submitted
affidavits.
the
district
court
went
to
the
jail,
visited
it
and
said
as,
as
people
have
been
known
to
say
about
obscenity,
it's
unconstitutional
i
know
when
i
see
it.
this
we
consider
to
be
an
unsatisfactory
way
of
dealing
with
this
issue
and
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
get
back
to
the
question
of
punishment.
one
thing
that's
very
important
you
ask
why
are
we
inquiring
into
physical
and
administrative
reasons
for
the
double-bunking.
nobody
in
the
lower
courts
has
based
any
decision
on
the
grounds
of
what
happened
here
was
punishment,
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
decision.
that
is
the
argument
of
the
respondents
in
an
effort
to
surmount
the
lack
of
authority
to
support
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
a
compelling
necessity
standard
was
appropriate
to
judge
the
restriction
on
the
liberty
of
the
inmates
that
was
involved.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
this
was
punishment.
now,
they
say
it's
punishment,
but
they
do
not
analyze
the
concept
in
the
way
this
court
has
analyzed
it,
that
is
they
do
not
look
to
the
standards
in
mendoza-martinez
that
suggest
how
you
go
about
the
inquiry
of
determining
whether
or
not
something
is
punishment.
and
we
think
if
you
apply
that
inquiry
in
this
case,
you
would
not
conclude
that
what
happened
here
was
punishment.
so
i
come
back
to
the
point
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
our
argument
is
that
unless
or
until
there
is
a
finding
that
there
is
a
lack
of
a
reasonable
relationship
under
whatever
level
of
judicial
scrutiny
might
be
given
to
government's
justification
between
the
practice
of
double-bunking
and
the
government
–
legitimate
governmental
objectives
that
might
support
that
practice,
the
practice
stands
–-
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
think
that
it
could,
but
that
is
because
we
don't
think
the
concept
of
punishment
has
a
useful
role
to
play
in
an
analyzing
the
due
process
plan.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
now
depends
upon
what
view
you
take.
the
view
that
you
have
taken
in
the
moore
case
i
believe
and
perhaps
in
other
places
is
that
it
has
to
be
one
of
a
specific
category
of
interest
that
are
fundamental
and
that
are
subjected
to
searching
scrutiny
and
punishment
would
be
such
an
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
understood
the
moore
case
to
suggest
that
there
were
five
votes
on
this
court
at
least
for
the
proposition
that
the
due
process
concept
is
a
rational
continuum
in
justice
harlan's
words
and
that
is
not
include
just
a
series
of
points
that
are
picked
out.
in
our
view
of
course
it
doesn't
matter
for
the
disposition
of
this
case.
we
were
entitled
to
hearing
to
show
the
reasons
why
and
to
explore
the
effects
of
the
conditions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
agree,
if
its
punishment,
we
would
be
defendants.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
yes
on
the
grounds
of
the
due
process
clause,
now,
there
are
there
are
two
separate
ways
however
to
look
at
the
due
process
analysis.
one,
is
an
importation
of
the
eighth
amendment
standard
into
to
due
process
clause
and
the
second
is
to
view
it
independently
as
a
liberty
interest
not
to
be
subjected
to
over
crowding
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
court
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
court
has,
has
i
think
the
courts
have
approached
that
concept
in
a
pragmatic
way
that
is
they're
prepared
to
say
the
conditions
of
confinement
that
fall
below
minimal
standards
of
decency
to
constitute
punishment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
case
might
be
different
because
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
per
say
probation
turned
upon
the
design
quality
or
the
aspect
of
the
case.
it
was
designed
for
one
person
they
said
you
cannot
two
people
in
a
room
designed
for
one.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
defend
it
of
course.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
might
have
won
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
say.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we're
not
asking
you
to
–
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
have
explained
to
the
court
that
we
have
been
able
to
comply
with
the
outstanding
injunction
because
the
number
of
pretrial
detainees
has
at
present
is
dramatically
lower
than
it
was
two
years
ago.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
still
take
the
position,
the
population
in
the
institution
at
present
is
fluctuating
at
or
near
449
people
the
present
capacity
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
designed
for
449.
the
present
capacity
in
terms
of
numbers
of
beds
as
hired
because
there
are
30
extra
beds
in
the
dormitory,
so
actually
up
to
479
could
be
held.
in
fact,
as
a
practical
matter
you
can't
always
do
it
because
you
have
classifications
that
is
you
have
a
unit
for
women,
male
prisoners
are
not
put
in
that
unit,
you
might
have
10
empty
beds
in
there
but
you
simply
can't
use
them
and
there
are
other
kinds
of
problems
like
that.
but
it
is
our
position
that
an
injunction
has
been
issued
against
us
that
we
believe
is
improper
and
unauthorized
and
without
constitutional
basis
and
that
we
would
if
the
need
arose
again
and
it
may,
resort
to
double-bunking
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
don't
know,
i
don't
--
we
would
object
to
a
disposition
that
involved
let's
say
i
dismissal
of
the
writ.
i
don't
know
that
we
would
object
to
a
disposition
of
vacating
the
injunction
and
remanding
it.
we
just
think
that
under
the
--
i
think
united
states
v.
w.
t.
grant
is
a
case
which
indicates
that
it
would
not
be
moot
where
we
say
that
we
will
again
do
what
the
injunction
prohibited.
i
don't
know
in
the
district
court
when
it
gets
back
there
if
you
do
reverse
whether
there
will
be
a
meaningful
controversy
because
i
don't
know
how
the
district
court
is
going
to
decide
whether
double-bunking
is
justified
at
a
time
when
it's
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
doesn't
exist.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
may
be
a
very
important
question.
my
understanding
and
when
i
made
inquiry
about
that
i
was
advised
that
there
is
some
court
of
appeals'
authority
to
the
affect
that
habeas
corpus
this
class
action
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
there
is
none
here
i
am
simply
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it's
an
important
question.
i
don't
think
it's
an
important
question
in
this
case
because
we
didn't
raise
it
until,
well
perhaps
it
would
have
been
an
important
question
that
we
might
have
raised.
i
don't
mean
to
facetious.
i
am
not
clear
that
it's
before
the
court
presently
for
decision
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
kind
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
habeas
corpus
over
a
claim
and
the
question
of
whether
class
action
was
improperly
certified.
we
do
have
another
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
would
be
prepared
if
the
court
wants
us
to
research
the
question
and
submit
our
views
on
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now
we're
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
suggesting
that
we
are
not
requesting
relief
except
as
regards
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
have
raised
in
our
petition.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
way
we've
–
at
the
time
that
we
brief
that
the
policy
had
already
been
changed
and
our
briefing
was
intended
to
focus.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
if
the
hardcover
books
were
not
involved,
and
the
injunction
had
been
issued
only
against
soft
cover
books
then
i
think
they
should
be
moot.
as
i
was
saying
earlier
because
we
have
not
intention
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
guess,
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
draw
a
matter
of
something.
