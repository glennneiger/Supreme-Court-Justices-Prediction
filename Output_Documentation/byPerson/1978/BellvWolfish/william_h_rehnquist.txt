justice

h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey
when
you
say
pretrial
detainees
i
take
it
you
are
excluding
those
who
are
confined
other
than
in
a
status
as
pretrial
detainees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
in
middendorf
against
henry
which
is
october
term
1975,
i
think
the
opinion
of
the
court
expressly
reserved
the
prior
--
the
question
as
to
whether
a
habeas
corpus
action
could
be
a
class
action.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
approved
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
a
liberty
interest
or
a
property
interest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
that
have
to
do
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then,
doesn't
your
right
to
detain
have
to
depend
on
the
finding
that
these
people
were
found,
not
likely
to
show
up
in
for
their
trials
where
upon
furnishing
a
bail,
therefore
you
had
to
detain
them
in
order
to
assure
their
presence
at
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you've
met
all
those
tests
then
you're
depriving
them
of
liberty
simply
in
order
to
assure
their
presence
at
trial
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
purpose
of
the
detention
must
have
some
bearing
on
the
standard
of
review.
if
it's
punishment,
it's
one
thing.
if
it's
simply
assuring
that
they
will
show
up
for
trial
because
there
is
no
other
way
that
you
can
assure
their
appearance
is
may
be
another.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
you
defined
overcrowding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
mean
to
be
anecdotal
but
the
troopship
i
came
back
from
the
second
world
war
had
bunked
stacks
six
high
in
the
hold
of
a
ship
and
i
don't
think
the
common
view
then
was
that
was
form
of
punishment
or
that
it
was
necessarily
overcrowding
given
the
circumstance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
couldn't
we
put
a
blanket
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
isn't
supposed
to
be
a
spa,
it's
a
prison?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
if
you
comply
with
an
injunction
presumably
to
avoid
contempt
you
can
nonetheless
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
in
the
prerequisite
to
avoidance
of
mootness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
those
may
support
your
contention
here
that
the
order
was
proper
but
i
don't
see
how
they
support
their
contention
that
the
case
is
moot
because
the
court
ordered
the
government
to
do
something
but
it
didn't
want
to
do
voluntarily,
the
court
--
the
government
complied
with
that
order
under
the
threat
of
contempt
sanction
and
appeal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that
the
government's
position
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
it
is
entitled
to
act
on
its
own
without
going
to
the
district
court
and
asking
it
for
a
certificate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
isn't
its
position
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
subjected
to
that
sort
of
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
if
they
feel
the
remedy
is
improperly
imposes
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
i
suppose
they
have
a
right
to
appeal
even
though
you
suggest
they
have
perhaps
an
easier
out
by
simply
complying
with
the
order,
but
that
doesn't
moot
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
bamberger
what
if
the
place
have
been
designed
originally
so
that
the
sleeping
rooms
were
to
house
two
people
in
exactly
the
way
that
the
government
ultimately
ended
up
housing
them,
but
the
other
facilities
had
met
the
standards
that
you
think
they
are
to
mean.
so
there
wasn't
a
question
later
putting
in
more
people
they
were
designed
for,
but
just
designing
of
close,
more
closely
confined
sleeping
room.
do
you
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
supposing
that
was
all
present,
but
it
was
simply
designed
that
way.
the
government
just
decided
they
put
twice
as
many
people,
but
that
was
of
the
architect's
plan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
isn't
a
question
about
going
beyond
what
the
capacity
of
prison
was
originally
supposed
to
house?
it's
a
question
of
some
standard
that
a
court
gets
from
somewhere
as
to
how
many
square
feet
each
prisoner
should
have
regardless
of
what
the
architect
plans?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
those
are
absorbed
in
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
won
in
the
court
of
appeals?
