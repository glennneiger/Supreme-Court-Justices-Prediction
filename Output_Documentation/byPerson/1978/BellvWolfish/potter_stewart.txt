justice
potter
stewart
well,
all
those
categories
of
people
are
people
who
have
been
convicted
and
sentenced
to
confinement?
justice
potter
stewart
and
since
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
did
not
find
that
this
was
in
any
way
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that,
those
people
are
out
of
the
case,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
the
double-bunking
business.
justice
potter
stewart
a
basic
question,
didn't
the
preiser
case
hold
that
when
all
that
is
challenged,
the
conditions
of
confinement
by
contrast
with
the
fact
of
confinement,
that
habeas
corpus
is
inappropriate?
that
habeas
corpus
is
appropriate
only
to
secure
release
in
other
words?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
generally
familiar
[voice
overlap]
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
class
action
is
one
thing,
but
the
basic
availability
of
habeas
corpus
is
more
fundamental.
that's
jurisdictional,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
[voice
overlap]
you
want
the
lawsuit
or
otherwise
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
there
are
no
disputes
they
must
and
you
mean
constitutionally?
justice
potter
stewart
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
a
due
process
has
to
do
with
it?
justice
potter
stewart
[voice
overlap]
isn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
said
pretrial
detainees.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all.
justice
potter
stewart
not
only
could
be
usually
punished
they
can't
be
punished
at
all
can
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
matter
of
due
process
you
said.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
if
it's
inevitably
punishment
then
there
could
be
no
pretrial
detainees?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
allow
punishment
of
anybody
who
is
not
been
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
is
punishment
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
pretrial
detainee,
everybody
have
to
be
released?
justice
potter
stewart
may
be
not
providing
each
pretrial
detainee
a
suite
of
rooms
is
not
necessary
to
assure
you
showing
up
at
trial
or
not
providing
each
one
a
private
bathroom?
justice
potter
stewart
why
does
the,
i
don't
understand
the
connection?
justice
potter
stewart
so
arguably,
would
depriving
somebody
of
a
suite
of
rooms
and
private
bathroom.
justice
potter
stewart
they
are,
aren't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it's
not
--
is
it
a
per
se
case
even
with
respect
to
the
class?
now
by
definition
these
people
are
impoverished
people
or
else
they
could
have
made
bail
and
been
out
released
on
bond.
wouldn't
it
be
necessary
to
compare
their
living
conditions
before
they
were
in
this
facility
with
their
living
conditions
in
the
facility?
some
might
be
better
some
might
be
worse
and
some
might
be
arguably
about
same.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
you
concede,
it
cannot
be
allowed
to
these
people,
don't
you?
you
concede
the
legitimacy
of
pretrial
detention,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
bamberger
that
leads
me
to
ask
questions
beyond
on
my
mind.
i
got
it
some
where
in
these
briefs
which
i
read
it,
good
time
to
go,
christmas
time,
that
there
is
been
a
change
in
the
situation
since
this
litigation
was
commenced
and
that
there
is
no
considerably
less
if
indeed
any
overcrowding
in
this
facility?
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
there
is
no
overcrowding
of
the
kind
about
what
your
complaining,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
the
case
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
may,
but
it's
disappeared
now
hasn't
it,
haven't
they
changed
their
policy?
don't
they,
no
longer
keep
in
custody
here
for
the
workforce?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
isn't
the
case
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
conceivable
that
the
case
could
become
--
this
place
had
burned
down
and
there
were
no
more
mca,
then
the
case
would
probably
been
moved,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
want
to
know?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
submission
that
unless
or
until
there's
a
finding
that
this
amounts
to
punishment,
the
due
process
clause
is
not
implicated?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
you
don't
accept
my,
the
series
suggested
in
my
question.
do
you
think
that
it
violated
the
due
process
clause
even
if
it
is
not
punishment
[voice
overlap]
justice
potter
stewart
then
how
was
the
due
process
clause
implicated?
obviously,
i
think
everybody
would
agree
that
government
cannot
punish
somebody
until
or
unless
he's
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
therefore
you
can't
take
a
pretrial
detainee
and
put
him
or
do
anything
else,
that's
obviously
punishment.
justice
potter
stewart
now
that
would
clearly
implicate
the
due
process
clause
in
this
case
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
absent
a
finding
a
punishment
how
is
the
due
process
clause
involved?
justice
potter
stewart
[voice
overlap]
constitution
and
then
in
order
to
find
the
answer
to
a
constitutional
question
you
look
at
the
constitution,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
its
punishment,
all
the
reasons
in
the
world
wouldn't
make
this
constitutional,
would
it,
if
you
show
there
are
good
reasons
to
whip
these
people
once
a
day?
justice
potter
stewart
then
there
wouldn't
be
no
[voice
overlap]
at
all
constitutionally?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fery,
with
respect
to
the
publisher-only
rule
you
indicate
in
your
briefs
as
i
remember
that
the
government
is
now
changed
as
practice
and
policy
and
there's
no
longer
enforced
such
rule
with
respect
to
paperback
books?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
to
that
extent
you're
not
â€“
justice
potter
stewart
planning
about
asking
that
the
court
of
appeal's
judgment
be
disturbed
in
that
aspect?
justice
potter
stewart
now
how
about
the
more
general
change
of
conditions
in
the
overcrowding
in
this
facility?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
--
don't
you
represent
to
us
now
that
there
is
no
more
overcrowding?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
still
complaining?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
designed
for
449?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
would
vigorously
object
any
suggestion
that
this
case
is
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
when
it
doesn't
exist.
