chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
bell
against
wolfish.
mr.
frey
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready,
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
the
people
who
will
remain
there,
who
are
awaiting
trial,
by
definition
they
have
not
been
able
to
secure
release
on
bail
or
they
wouldn't
be
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
history
of
class--
habeas
corpus
class
action
that
you're
familiar
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
bamberger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
mrs.
bamberger
that
double-bunking,
as
it
has
been
described,
is
in
itself
a
punishment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
double-bunking
be
--
would
double-bunking
a
form
of
punishment
in
the
military
services
for
example
,in
an
army
camp?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they're
all
--
they're
detained
under
military
discipline.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
army,
navy,
marine
corps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
talking
about
double-bunking.
now
you
say
--
you
are
supporting
the
idea
that
double-bunking
is
per
se
punishment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
is
the
overcrowding
caused
by
double-bunking
or
the
double-bunking
caused
by
overcrowding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
you
go
into
some
military
camps
right
today
and
when
we
are
in
no
war,
you
will
find
a
considerable
amount
of
double
bunking.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
move
on
to
that,
will
you
tell
me
please,
what
authority
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
to
say
that
the
ancient
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
is
a
class
action,
could
be
used
under
a
class
action
umbrella?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
with
the
habeas
--
with
the
habeas.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
in
a
class
action
that's
all
i
am
addressing
myself
to
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
shouldn't
be
much
over
10
and
by
7.5?[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
it's
just
your
five
minute
warning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
the
reason
for
that
was
to
prevent
drugs
and
weapons
from
being
concealed
in
a
book
and
related
matters,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
we
should
make
the
district
judge
or
some
judge
the
director
of
the
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
regard
it
as
an
extreme
measure
to
prohibit
books
being
handed
to
the
prisoners
without
inspection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
bamberger.
you
have
about
five
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
understand
the
government
concedes
or
taking
no
position
on
the
question
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
subject
to
a
class
action,
not
a
very
important
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
none
here
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
that's
an
important
question
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there's
no
jurisdiction,
it's
before
the
court
whether
anyone
raised
it
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
one
which
deserves
some
exploration,
would
you
not
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
we'll
pass
on
that
later.
we'll
resume
--
excuse
me,
we'll
resume
arguments
at
1
o'clock,
but
subject
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
won't
be
back
at
1
o'clock?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
