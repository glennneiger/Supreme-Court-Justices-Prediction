it's
what
you
said
--
applicable
statutes
on
bail?

but
doesn't
there
have
to
be
some
finding

some
alternatives

well,
so
that
isn't
--
what
you
said
really
doesn't
cover
the
kind
of
a
determination
that's
been
made.

cells
were

they
had
ten

and
then
when
two
people,
just
room
for
two
chairs
and
they
kept

24
hours
a

would
you
think
you
could
be
enjoined
from

justice
byron

on
grounds
of
the
due

clause?
justice
byron
r.

but
that
involves
punishment,
doesn't
it,
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
means
that
there
is
some
punishment.
justice

let
me
get
one
thing
straight.
i
take
it
you
–
you'd
making
the
same
argument
here
if
this
facility
had
been
deserve
the
way
it's
been
used?
it
would
be,
you
know,
perhaps
isn't
relevant
but
it
isn't
crucial
that
it
was
planned
to
hold
x
number
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
had
the
whole
2x.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
my
question
still
is
if
it
has
been
designed
the
way
it
has
been
used
you
would
be
still
be
here
defending
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
might
if
you're
asking.
mr.
frey,
do
you
think
the
issue
on
the
books
is
moot,
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
suggesting?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
put
–
you
raised
this
question
in
your
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you've
briefed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
does
that
mean
that
the
issue
has
become
moot
since
the
filing
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
injunction
would
then
be
vacated
to
that
extent?
