mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
on
this
case
is
whether
blue
shield's
agreements
with
various
pharmacists
constitute
the
“business
of
insurance”
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
(b)
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
the
issue
does
not
concern
the
merits
of
the
respondent's
antitrust
allegations.
there's
been
no
ruling
on
the
merits
the
antitrust
issues
and
there's
been
no
facts
developed
with
respect
to
it.
but
i
would
stress
that
the
out
--
simply
stress
at
the
outset,
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stevens
made
which
was
that
the
consequence
of
petitioner's
position
would
be
that
even
if
the
facts
showed
a
conspiracy
between
a
group
of
pharmacists
to
fix
the
price
of
prescription
drugs
and
a
use
of
a
pharmacy
agreement
within
insurance
company
to
implement
that
conspiracy
the
consequence
of
petitioner's
position
would
be
that
it
would
be
the
business
of
insurance
and
therefore
exempt
from
antitrust
laws.
but
the
issue
presented
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
are
two
portions
to
section
2
(b)
which
maybe
the
source
of
some
of
your
confusion
but
under
either
portion
if
a
activity
is
not
the
business
of
insurance
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
state
law
regulates
it
or
does
not.
our
position
is
that
the
pharmacy
agreements
are
not
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
part,
excuse
me,
no
part
of
2
(b)
would
grant
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
if
there
was
no
state
regulation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
true
even
(voice
overlap)
even
if
the
activity
is
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
my
understanding
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
my
understanding
too.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
my
understanding
mr.
justice
white.
you
would
not
have
to
ask
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
if
the
provider
agreements
are
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
but
if
they
were
not
at
court
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
issue
presented
by
petitioner's
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is
simply
whether
the
pharmacy
agreements
are
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
section
2
(b).
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
pertinent
portion
i
think
is
they
provide
it
that
after
june
30,
1948
the
act
of
july
1819
know
as
a
sherman
act,
and
the
act
known
as
clayton
,
and
the
act
known
as
a
federal
trade
commission
act
shall
be
applicable
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
the
extent
that
such
business
is
no
regulated
by
a
state
law.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
by
reverse
implication
that
would
suggest
that
if
it
were
regulated
by
a
state
law
those
particular
acts
would
not
apply.
the
main
provision
of
section
2
(b)
provides
no
act
of
congress
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
my
understanding
although
of
course
under
our
position
it
wouldn't
make
difference
because
under
our
position
it's
not
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
quite
alright.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
first
part
of
2
(b)
provides
no
act
of
congress
shall
be
construed
to
supersede
according
from
memory.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
any
state
law
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
including
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
supersede.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
the
first
part
of
section
2
(b)
would
do
so
expressly.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
let
me
modify
my
position,
it
is
not
only
the
latter
part.
the
latter
part
refers
specifically
to
the
sherman
act
upon
which
petitioners
relied
for
their
antitrust
complaint.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
first
part
would
include
the
sherman
act
as
well
as
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
correct.
but
the
first
part
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
but
the
first
part
would
only
limit
the
application
to
federal
law
to
the
extend
it
happened
to
supersede
a
state
law
designed
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance
if
i
made
myself
clear.[laughter]
in
any
event,
we
contended
that
the
pharmacy
agreements
are
not
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
and
our
argument
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
the
precise
scope
of
the
business
of
insurance
exemption
is
not
clearly
delineated
and
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
there
maybe
areas
of
reasonable
doubt.
although,
this
court
has
frequently
stated
the
principle
that
in
areas
of
reasonable
doubt;
antitrust
exemptions
are
to
be
narrowly
construed
and
antitrust
application
to
be
favor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
this
court
has
applied
that
principle
even
in
the
case
of
express
exemptions.
the
two
cases
for
example
that
we
cited
in
our
brief,
abbott
laboratories
and
federal
maritime
commission
versus
seatrains
were
case
of
express
exemptions
from
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
when
you're
dealing
with
an
express
exemption
such
as
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
or
the
many
other
express
exemptions,
the
principle
applies
that
exemption
is
to
be
narrowly
construed.
in
any
event,
what
the
legislative
history
the
mccarran
act
does
indicate
is
this
court
has
held
in
sec
versus
variable
annuity
company
and
sec
versus
national
securities
is
first
that
congress'
core
concern
with
respect
to
the
business
of
insurance
was
the
underwriting
risk
and
the
relationships
between
insurance
companies
and
policyholders
that
concern
the
underwriting
of
risk.
and
the
second
thing
the
legislative
history
indicates
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
exempt
everything
an
insurance
company
does.
those
two
facts
support
our
contention
that
the
pharmacy
agreements
are
not
the
business
of
insurance.
first,
the
pharmacy
agreements
are
not
the
underwriting
of
risk.
they
are
simply
contracts
for
the
purchase
of
drugs
and
drug
distribution
services
by
blue
shield
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
my
response
is
that
that
example
is
a
good
illustration
of
our
point.
we
think
it
would
be
absurd
to
contend
that
an
agreement
between
an
insurance
company
and
a
law
firm
concerning
the
supplying
of
legal
services
to
the
insurance
company
is
the
business
of
insurance
in
any
ordinary
sense.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
even
if
it's
in
the
policy
itself
it
simply
begs
common
ordinary
understanding
to
say
that
an
agreement
between
an
insurance
company
and
a
law
firm
about
how
much
they're
going
to
pay
per
hour
is
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
true
too
your
honor
and
our
argument
that
will
follow.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
paying
of
the
claims
to
the
insurer
--
to
the
policyholder
is
the
business
of
insurance
and
an
agreement
between
the
insurance
company
and
somebody
who
provides
services
is
we
contend
not
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
including
the
doctors,
including
the
pharmacists,
there's
no
difference
between
pharmacist
and
doctors.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i'm
not
certain,
i
understanding
to
your
point
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
true.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
hiring
of
the
doctors
would
not
be
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
would
not
be
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
and
maybe
perfectly
lawful.
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
it's
not
lawful
but
it
wouldn't
be
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
think
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
hard
to
see
how
those
contracts
had
violated
the
antitrust
laws
but
the
relationship
between
although
the
question
is
not
so
clear.
i
think
that's
an
area
of
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
it
seems
to
me
basis
for
distinction
between
one's
dealings
with
ones
own
employees
and
ones
dealing
with
outside
contract.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
think
as
i
say
my
first
response
would
be
that
i
don't
think
labor
relation
agreements
between
an
insurance
company
and
doctors
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
between
insurance
company
and
its
doctors,
my
first
reaction
was
i
don't
think
that
will
be
the
business
of
insurance
although
i
think
the
question
there
would
be
closer
because
i
think
there's
a
basis
for
distinction.
but
the
point
we
wish
to
emphasize
is
that
at
some
point
you
have
to
draw
the
line.
relations
--
insurance
companies
have
myriad
relationships
with
third
parties
what
you
would
call
independent
contractors
to
furnish
the
insurance
company
with
good
and
services.
they
contract
with
printers,
they
contract
with
lawyers,
they
contract
with
building
owners.
congress,
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
the
act
of
congress
intended
and
all
of
those
kinds
of
relationships
to
be
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
the
promise
is
insurance
to
deliver
in
the
pharmacy
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
i
agree
that
that
would
be
insurance
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
but
only
in
the
same
sense.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
we
can
say
no
because
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
furnishing
of
the
services
to
the
policyholders,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
negotiation
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
lawyer
we
would
contend
does
not
the
business
of
insurance
because
there
is
no
principle
basis
for
distinguishing
that
kind
of
agreement
between
insurance
company
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
because
the
any
kind
of
any
distinction
on
that
basis
would
break
down.
for
instance,
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
contract
that
purchased
the
paper?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
we
would
contend
it
would
not
be
and
that
a
conspiracy
between
printers
to
fix
the
price
of
printing
services
which
used
an
agreement
within
an
insurance
company
to
do
too
to
implement
that
conspiracy
is
not
what
congress
intended
to
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
exactly,
we
contend
it
would
be.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
under
our
contention
--
but
not
on
the
petitioner's
contention.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
but
not
consistently.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
our
response
is
that
it
is
not
because
if
it
were
then
everything
in
an
insurance
company
would
do
to
save
its
own
costs
of
services
would
be
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
but
congress
did
not
so
intend.
it's
clear
from
this
court's
decisions
in
congress.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice
but
the
distinction
is
important.
he
makes
that
concession
and
that's
perfectly
true.
we
agree
with
that
but
what
his
position
necessarily
entails
is
that
if
that
conspiracy
between
the
pharmacist
were
embodied
in
an
agreement
with
an
insurance
company
that
would
be
the
business
of
--
that
agreement
would
make
it
all
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
their
position
your
honor.
i
didn't
hear
him
to
say
that
this
morning.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
but
if
that's
his
position
what
he
saying
is
that
then
we
can
violate
the
antitrust
laws
by
entering
into
an
agreement
with
pharmacist
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
the
pharmacist
would
be
guilty
of
antitrust
and
we
would
not.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
but
what
this
court
has
established
is
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
didn't
intend
to
immunize
entities
that
intended
to
immunize
conduct,
agreements
practices
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
right.
but
it
doesn't
matter
who's
engaging
in
it.
