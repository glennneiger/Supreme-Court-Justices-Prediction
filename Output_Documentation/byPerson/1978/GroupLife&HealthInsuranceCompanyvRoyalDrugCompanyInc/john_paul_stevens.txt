mr.
kaiser.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
like
to
go
back
because
i'm
not
all
clear
in
light
of
the
way
you
started
your
argument.
you
emphasized
the
fact
that
historically
this
arrangement
was
a
result
of
collective
bargaining
and
you
seem
to
think
that
that
was
important
to
your
case.
as
i
understood,
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
the
arrangement
is
suppose
to
be
beneficial
to
the
consumer
and
also
to
blue
shield
--
your
client
financially
beneficial
in
terms
of
lower
rates
to
the
consumer,
the
public,
the
insured.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that's
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
demand
it
because
it
offers
this
coverage
at
lower
rates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
hadn't
heard
you
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
lower
rates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
in
a
sense
that
protects
i
understood
from
your
argument
in
your
brief
the
blue
shield
company
and
similar
insures
from
the
hazard
of
perhaps
higher
charges
by
pharmaceutical
retailer
outlets
around
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
for
all
of
these,
would
you
have
thought
blue
shield
would
wanted
this
without
regard
to
any
pressure
from
labor
unions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
said
for
all
of
the
economic
reasons
i
would've
thought
blue
shield
as
a
business
operation
saving
the
public
would
want
it
this
sort
of
contract
without
regard
to
any
pressure
from
a
labor
union.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
last
terms
paul
case
have
any
bearing
on
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
as
it
shows
a
boycott,
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree
to
accept
the
price
blue
shield
is
willing
to
pay
is
what
you're
saying
which
has
to
be
a
lower
price
than
the
others
want
for
their
drugs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
a
boycott.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i've
been
quoting
from
section
2
(b).
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allen,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
about
this.
i
know
i
put
that
example
forward
but
is
that
true
if
the
state
of
texas
has
not
specifically
approved
that
particular
arrangement?
in
other
words,
doesn't
the
exemption
only
come
into
place
as
part
of
2
(b)
which
says
no
act
of
congress
shall
invalidate
the
state
law
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
insurance
and
unless
you
have
stated
provably
you
don't
have
the
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
be
sure
i
get
my
confusion
cleared
up
because
i
am
confused.
what
part
of
2
(b)
would
grant
an
exemption
if
you
have
no
state
regulation?
you
just
told
me
that
there
are
two
parts
to
2
(b)
one
of
which
was
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
then
in
my
hypothetical,
there's
no
exemption
unless
there
is
state
regulation
which
authorized
that
particular
arrangement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
hate
to
take
up
all
your
time
on
my
confusion
but
i
think
it
is
important
that
i
understand
the
statutes.
so,
i'm
going
to
ask
you
one
more
question.
what
is
the
language
in
the
mccarran
act
which
grants
the
exemption
if
there
is
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
read
me
the
words
that
you
talk
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
it
at
anywhere
say
and
you
say
by
reverse
implication
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
so,
you're
saying
that
the
--
in
other
words,
it's
the
reverse
implication
of
the
proviso
as
the
sole
source
of
the
exemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
words
the
“business
of
insurance”
are
found
in
that
section
2?
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
i'm
sorry
of
taking
your
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
price
fixing
agreement
have
to
be
the
fix
maximum
prices
to
be
unlawful
supposing
it's
an
agreement
to
fix
prices
is
much
lower
than
anybody
else
can
charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
be
illegal
either
way,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
could
have
a
lot
of
group
of
large
druggist
who
wanted
to
have
a
very
low
price
in
order
to
drive
small
companies
out
of
business
for
example
and
persuaded
blue
shield
to
go
along
with
it
and
that
would
normally
be
an
antitrust
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allen
to
be
sure
that
my
confusion
is
completely
cleared
up,
do
you
agree
with
the
view
that
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
exemption
under
section
2
(b)
of
the
mccarran
act
you
must
establish
both
that
you're
in
the
business
of
insurance
and
secondly
that
that
which
you
claim
is
an
exemption
is
regulated
by
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
lawyer
to
employees
to
defend
the
casualty
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
go
back
where
we
started
on
the
lawyer
hired
by
the
insurance
company
to
defend
the
policyholder
who
sued
under
a
liability
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
policy
says,
“we'll
defend
all
claims.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say
by
lawyers
or
how
but
then
they
go
and
hire
lawyers
to
defend
the
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
think
i
don't
need
any
adjectives.
yes
or
no,
is
it
covered
in
your
view
or
not?
is
it
part
of
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
might
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
very
confident
and
yet
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
that
in
providing
drug
as
i
indicated
earlier.
i
don't
understand
your
lack
of
confidence
on
that
case
in
your
complete
confidence
on
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
pay
money
and
you
go
out
and
borrow
money
from
a
bank
to
pay
off
a
claim
in
dollars,
is
that
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
company
has
a
little
short
of
cash
so
they
go
to
the
bank
to
raise
the
cash
to
pay
off
a
very
large
claim
at
some
catastrophe
of
some
kind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how's
that
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
the
insurance
company
needs
to
satisfy
a
claim
that
it's
obligated
and
under
the
policy
to
satisfy,
it's
$10.00
rather
than
drugs.
i
don't
see
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
criteria
there
is
that
it
be
the
business
of
insurance.
it's
kind
of
a
question
begging
criteria
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
buy
the
company.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
apply
that
all
that
language
to
make
a
big
loan
from
a
bank
to
pay-off
a
policy
obligation
it
seems
to
me?
