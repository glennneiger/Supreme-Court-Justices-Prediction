justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kaiser,
what
is
the
business
reason
either
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
insured
or
the
insurer
for
requiring
in
the
policy
between
those
two
that
blue
shield
enter
into
an
agreement
with
providers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
they
insist
on
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
couldn't
they
get
that
sort
of
coverage
and
leave
it
up
to
the
insurer
to
decide
how
he
was
going
to
go
about
procuring
the
benefits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
happened
to
do
disagree
with
my
brother
stewart's
comment
that
your
answer
that
justice
stevens'
question
helps
you
rather
than
hurts
you
and
i
don't
see
the
bright
line
that
you're
talking
about
between
an
agreement
on
the
part
of
and
casualty
insurance
company
with
a
law
firm
to
defend
its
policyholders
in
lawsuits
in
which
they're
sued
and
an
agreement
with
drugstores
or
pharmaceutical
houses
to
provide
drugs
where
the
causality
insured
against
is
the
need
of
drugs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
justice
stevens'
questions
meets
everyone
of
the
criteria
you've
just
set
forth.
the
covenant
on
the
part
of
casualty
insured
to
defend
the
insured
if
he's
sued
as
a
result
of
an
accident.
if
i'm
wrong
if
in
thinking,
so
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
the
insured
simply
went
ahead
and
as
a
part
of
the
policy
with
the
insurer
when
they
have
as
a
part
of
the
policy
with
the
insureds
said,
we're
also
going
to
draw
up
an
agreement
with
the
law
firm
to
provide
services
to
you
and
that's
part
of
this
policy
then
the
two
would
be
the
same.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
had
chosen
to
regulate
this
contrary
to
your
contention,
would
you
say
that
you
would
--
should
lose
your
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
even
if
it
constitutes
the
business
of
insurance
if
the
state
is
not
regulating
it
then
and
who
was
this
person
that
you
had
on
the
witness
stand
that
you
were
asking
by
these
legal
questions
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
he
a
lawyer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
talking
about
now
more
about
the
merits
i
suppose
and
about
the
business
of
insurance
exemption
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
would
somebody
have
a
retail
drugstore
have
an
action
against
the
bank
of
america
because
the
bank
of
americard,
it's
kind
of
coerces
people
to
go
to
drugstores
that
will
accept
the
bank
of
americard
even
and
take
5%
off
their
gross
as
a
result
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
any
kind
of
credit
card
is
going
to
have
a
certain
coercive
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
i
ask
you
if
in
the
19
--
in
the
approvals
or
exemptions
of
the
policy
forms
that
you
were
speaking
about
in
1974
and
was
it
in
1969?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
weren't
the
provider
agreements
attached
to
those
forms?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
submitted
it
was
attached
to
the
form,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
about
in
1974?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
was
attached
and
the
policy
was
approved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
deposition
of
paul
conner
introduced
in
the
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
is
before
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
didn't
mr.
conner
testify
that
this
provider
agreement
was
part
of
insurance
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
too
clearly
i
am
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
recognize
that
he
looking
in
a
little
bit
different
direction
in
mr.
paul?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
this
a
question
that
would
ultimately
you
said
by
a
supreme
court
of
texas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
a
kind
of
question
that
would
ultimately
be
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
whether
the
texas
insurance
commissioner
has
what
your
furtherance
jurisdiction
over
this
matter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
not
relying
on
the
deposition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
really
think
that's
the
way
you
establish
what
might
be
a
fairly
important
question
to
state
law
to
have
conflicting
depositions
of
two
agencies
subordinates
as
to
what
they
think
the
state
law
provides?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
don't
need
the
depositions
from
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
implicit
exemption,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
one
applies
the
principle
of
narrow
construction
equally
to
express
exemptions
as
to
imply
the
exemption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
distinction
breaks
down
and
what
about
the
contract
of
purchase
the
paper
on
which
the
policy
is
written,
is
that
part
of
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
which
the
policy
is
printed.
