mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
group
life
and
health
insurance
company
also
known
as
blue
shield
of
texas.
this
case
involves
the
construction
of
the
exemption
to
the
antitrust
laws
established
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
there
is
only
one
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
and
that
issue
is
whether
the
statutory
term
business
of
insurance
as
contained
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
includes
a
contract
between
and
insurer
and
a
health
care
provider
to
furnish
benefits
owed
to
the
policyholders
under
the
insurer's
health
care
service
benefit
policies.
we
talk
only
about
one
issue.
blue
shield
health
care
service
benefit
policies
and
in
particular
the
prescription
drug
pharmacy
policy
which
we
talked
about
today
--
a
tripartite
service
benefit
agreement.
the
tripartite
service
benefit
agreement
is
composed
of
a
policy
between
an
insurer
and
an
insured
obligating
the
insurer
to
furnish
benefits
to
the
insured
in
the
form
of
goods
and
services
as
opposed
to
cash
reimbursement.
a
second
feature
of
the
tripartite
service
benefit
agreement
is
that
it
expressly
obligates
the
insurer
to
enter
into
a
provider
agreement
in
this
instance
your
honors,
a
pharmacy
agreement
to
provide
the
goods
and
services
which
are
the
risk
under
written
or
the
risk
assumed
in
the
policy.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
blue
shield,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
it
expressly
provides
that
the
benefits
will
be
provided
to
the
insured
through
a
participating
provider
and
it
obligates
the
insurer
to
enter
into
participating
agreements
with
providers.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
with
its
policy
it
certainly
would
your
honor.
this
policy
only
provides
that
blue
shield
will
contract
with
the
provider
to
provide
goods
and
services
or
needed
goods
and
services
in
the
form
of
prescription
drugs
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no
sir,
not
into
this
policy.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor
that
involves
a
little
bit
of
history.
the
business
reason
in
this
particular
instance
was
that
the
insured
and
the
beneficiaries
insisted
upon
that
type
of
policy.
the
insureds
under
the
policy
that
we
are
or
under
the
forerunners
of
our
policy
where
the
domestic
automobile
manufacturers
during
a
rather
prolong
strike
in
1967
one
of
the
major
issues
between
the
unions
and
the
manufacturers
was
additional
fringe
benefits
specifically
health
insurance
benefits.
out
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
unions
and
the
domestic
automobile
manufacturers
arose
in
agreement
that
the
domestic
automobile
manufacturers
would
in
fact
provide
health
insurance
benefits
in
the
form
of
full
coverage
service
benefit
provider
agreements.
our
tripartite
agreement
here
is
the
end-result
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
we're
not
saying
we're
connected
with
the
unions
or
the
auto
manufacturers,
we
are
saying
though
your
honor
that
the
insureds
and
their
beneficiaries.
the
insureds
being
the
automobile
manufacturers
and
there
have
been
beneficiaries
being
their
employees
and
the
employees'
families
insisted
upon
this
type
of
arrangement.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
they
wanted
full
benefits
coverage
your
honor,
at
a
minimum
cost.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
that
could
have
been
done
your
honor.
however,
it
was
insisted
that
provider
agreements
be
included
in
this
type
of
policy.
this
entire
tripartite
agreement
was
not
conceived
or
instigated
by
blue
shield.
it
was
conceived
and
instigated
by
the
insured
and
beneficiaries
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
the
essential
provisions
in
the
policy
dealing
with
benefits
and
coverage
were
all
insisted
and
in
fact
demanded
by
the
insureds
and
beneficiaries.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no
doubt
about
it.
no
doubt
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no,
sir
and
it
has
not
been
limited
to
the
automobile
people.
in
fact,
tripartite
service
benefit
arrangements
not
only
by
blue
shield
but
by
many
other
insurance
companies
throughout
the
country
or
in
effect
and
operating
today.
they
are
in
widespread
use.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
there
is
really
no
distinction,
no
practical
distinction
to
be
drawn
here
with
the
way
benefits
are
provided
under
our
policy
and
the
way
benefits
maybe
provided
under
another
traditional
form
of
interest.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
well,
i
might
add
your
honor
that
tripartite
service
benefit
agreements
already
distinct
the
feature
of
the
health
insurance
industry.
that
is
for
a
number
of
reasons,
one,
the
insured
or
the
policyholder
wants
full
coverage.
he
doesn't
want
to
worry
about
being
reimbursed
later
when
he
is
ill
or
a
member
of
his
family
are
ill
they
want
goods
and
services.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
that's
right.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
there
is
another
distinctive
feature
of
this
particular
type
arrangement
and
that
is
that
under
a
full
coverage
and
when
i
say
full
coverage
your
honor
i'm
talking
about
no
matter
what
it
takes
to
make
this
person
well,
the
insurance
company
will
furnish
those
have
insurance.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
now,
there's
a
$2.00
deductible
here
with
each
prescription.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no,
your
honor.
over
and
above,
the
$2.00
deductible
there
is
full
coverage
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
i
can't
agree
that
the
health
insurance
industry
is
anything
at
all
like
the
casualty
insurance
industry
because
of
the
very
peculiar
nature.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
in
as
much
as
you're
talking
about
that
being
a
part
of
the
benefits
and
coverage
of
the
policy.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
there
is
really
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so.
i
can't
say
that
because
for
a
very
simple
reason
we
say
that
there
is
a
bright
line
standard
to
be
drawn
here
and
what
is
included
in
the
business
of
insurance
and
the
context
of
our
case
and
we're
talking
about
a
provider
agreement.
it
does
not
encompass
everything
that
an
insurance
company
could
do.
it
does
not
encompass
every
contract
that
an
insurance
company
could
enter
in
to.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
well,
your
honor
i'm
trying
to
confine
and
i'm
not
arguing
with
the
court.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
goods
and
services,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no,
i
think
that
that
is
a
normal
concept
of
insurance
as
i
understood.
i
just
don't
want
the
court
to
think
that
i'm
coming
in
here
arguing
for
the
automobile
casualty
insurance
industry
when
i'm
not.
we
believe
that
the
health
insurance
industry
is
some
what
different.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
proper
line
is
that
an
agreement
--
a
third
party
agreement
which
relates
directly
to
the
provision
of
benefits.
those
benefits
which
are
under
written
in
the
policy
and
anything
in
that
agreement
which
directly
relates
to
the
cost
of
those
benefits
to
be
delivered
and
which
are
under
written
in
the
policy
would
constitute
a
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
from
mccarran-ferguson
purposes.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
there
is
no
service
benefit
policy.
i
mean
there
is
no
tripartite
agreement
there.
there
is
no
tripartite
agreement
that's
been
established
by
the
insured.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
i
think
we're
getting
very
close
to
prepaid
legal
services
in
many
states
which
i
have
been
proposed
to
be
operated
in
just
that
fashion.
i
think
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
i
can't
--
without
knowing
the
full
terms
of
a
policy
and
the
requirements
of
the
insurer,
the
obligations
--
the
contractual
obligations
of
the
insurer,
i'm
not
really
sure
that
i
could
comment
on
that.
the
pharmacy
agreement
in
this
particular
instance
though
is
the
integral
and
indispensable
part
of
the
tripartite
agreement.
without
it,
neither
the
policy
or
the
policy
is
not
effective
and
without
the
policy
then
the
pharmacy
agreement
is
not
effective.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
first
of
all
let
me
and
maybe
i
misunderstood
you
but
we
are
not
hinging
our
case
upon
the
fact
that
this
arose
out
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
essential
fact
there
though
is
that
this
type
of
policy
was
demanded
by
the
insureds
and
the
beneficiaries
that's
how
we
got
in
to
business.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
it
offers
full
coverage
at
lower
rates.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
and
it
guarantees
the
provision
of
benefits.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
one
of
the
principle
policies
behind
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
that
insurance
companies
be
able
to
maintain
themselves,
manage
their
own
business
subject
to
regulation
by
the
states
and
that
they'll
be
able
to
managing
their
business.
more
fully
assess
their
risks
and
provide
solvency
for
their
policy
over
us.
this
provides
the
reliability
that
the
insurance
company
must
have.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
pharmacy
agreement
because
it
does
in
fact
assist
blue
shield
in
controlling
the
cost
of
the
risks
that
it
has
assumed,
it
controls
the
magnitude
of
the
risk
so
to
speak.
and
in
such
a
situation
as
here
where
we
have
a
full
benefits
coverage
policy
open-ended,
there
is
no
limit
to
this
policy.
it's
essential
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
this
tripartite
benefit
arrangement
polices
have
been
in
effect
since
the
early
1930's.
they
were
an
outgrowth
of
the
depression
when
people
couldn't
get
adequate
health
care
service
at
a
reasonable
cost.
it
initially
started
out
with
three
party
arrangements
between
the
insurer
and
hospitals
and
the
insured.
by
1940,
these
three
party
arrangements
had
increased
to
where
they
had
4
million
subscribers
across
the
united
states.
this
is
not
something
new.
subsequent
to
that,
insurers
began
to
enter
into
three
party
arrangements
for
the
precise
reasons
that
we
have
for
with
the
positions
to
provide
physician
services
to
the
insured.
in
1944,
during
the
joint
senate
house
debates
on
the
passage
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
exemption,
attorney
general
biddle
made
an
express
comment
referring
to
the
tripartite
in
nature
of
these
service
benefit
policies
and
in
his
comment
he
said,
that
the
insurance
or
the
policy
that
they
were
talking
about
--
the
arrangements
that
they
were
talking
about
during
the
discussion
fits
put
one
word
in
that
perfectly.
he
said,
that
word
is
the
business
or
is
insurance.
attorney
general
biddle
was
referring
there
to
a
company
called
group
health
who
had
physicians
on
its
staff
and
it
agreed
with
its
policyholders
to
provide
hospital
services.
so,
this
is
nothing
new
your
honor
just
as
you
said
but
the
pharmacy
arrangement
portion
of
it
is
relatively
new.
it
was
in
--
became
effective
in
1969.
tripartite
arrangements
though
have
been
around
since
19
--
the
early
1930's,
your
honors,
we
believe
that
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
the
statutory
construction
in
this
court's
two
prior
decisions
that
clearly
pharmacy
agreements
come
within
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
the
st.
paul
versus
barry
case
dealt
with
the
three
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
portion
of
the
statute,
the
boycott
exception.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
it
has
no
direct
barring
but
it
does
has
some
barring
that
i
think
it's
very
beneficial
and
that
this
court
said
in
st.
paul
versus
barry
that
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
that
congress
intended
to
define
the
business
of
insurance
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
its
ordinary
meaning
or
customary
understanding
that
being
the
state
of
the
industry
at
the
time
of
the
act's
passage.
and
as
i
just
related
the
state
of
the
industry
at
the
time
of
the
act's
passage
was
that
tripartite
health
service
benefit
arrangements
were
flourishing.
they
were
well-known
to
the
public.
they
were
known
to
congress
and
in
fact
brought
the
congress'
attention
by
attorney
general
biddle.
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
we
see
some
very
broad
words,
“business
of
insurance”
and
every
person
engaged
therein.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
statute
that
congress
intended
to
limit
the
meaning
of
the
term
“business
of
insurance”
even
though
during
the
senate
house
debates
in
the
subcommittee
meeting.
there
were
numerous
suggestions
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
be
limited
severely.
it
would
suggest
about
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that
the
pharmacies
are
exempt.
it
is
our
position
that
the
pharmacy
agreement
constitutes
a
part
of
the
business
of
insured
and
as
exempt.
therefore,
both
signatories
to
that
agreement
must
be
exempt
or
we
disrate
the
purpose
of
the
act.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
as
i
understand
your
question
if
there
was
collaboration
among
the
pharmacies
and
then
they
went
in
the
insurance.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
we're
saying
that
the
pharmacy
agreement
constitutes
the
business
of
insurance
and
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purpose
of
the
act
both
signatories
to
the
agreement
must
be
exempt.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
it
would
be
our
position
and
if
the
signatories
collaborated
among
themselves
went
to
the
insurance
said,
“we
want
a
25%
increase
in
the
dispensing
fee
which
you
prepared
to
offer.”
if
that
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no,
your
honor
there
is
a
formula
--
a
reimbursement
formula
for
the
pharmacist.
the
pharmacist
receives
$2.00
from
the
insured.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
we
pay
him
a
dispensing
fee.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
plus,
the
acquisition
cost
of
the
drug.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
that
is
the
formula
which
is
reimbursed.
however,
back
to
your
question,
your
honor.
if
the
pharmacist
went
to
blue
shield
and
said,
“we
want
to
readjust
the
formula
and
we
want
more
money.”
and
if
that
was
ultimately
agreed
upon
and
incorporated
into
the
pharmacy
agreement
which
is
a
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
and
therefore
exempt.
we
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
an
actionable
collaboration
between
the
pharmacists.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
we
believe
that
if
it
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
i'm
not
really
sure
that
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
if
it
stopped
right
there
before
they
got
to
blue
cross,
it
probably
would
your
honor.
i
mean
blue
shield,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
well,
your
honor
most
times,
these
prices
or
the
establish
reimbursement
formula
would
be
establish
in
a
competitive
atmosphere.
if
the
pharmacists
want
to
charge
more
money
then
blue
shield
can
afford
to
pay
in
order
to
issue
its
policies
at
a
reasonable
level.
well,
then
there
may
be
some
negotiation
and
it
will
come
down
to
what
each
party
can
afford
to
pay
or
accept
but
the
reimbursement
formula
or
the
reimbursement
fee
would
therefore
be
established
in
a
competitive
atmosphere
and
if
incorporated
into
the
pharmacy
agreement
which
is
a
part
of
the
“business
of
insurance.”
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
well,
your
honor
that's
--
i
guess
that
is
always
possibility
obviously
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
quite
possibly
you
would,
your
honor.
i
might
mention
and
i
apologize
for
not
doing
it.
those
are
not
the
facts
of
our
case
and
in
fact
the
facts
of
our
case
were
quite
to
the
contrary.
in
our
case,
it
is
undisputed
and
uncontroverted
that
there
was
no
collaboration,
no
conspiracy
among
the
pharmacy
defendants
who
were
involved.
it
was
a
take
it
or
leave
it
offer
offered
by
blue
shield.
they
accepted
unilaterally.
we
entered
into
bilateral
contract.
in
fact,
the
government
agrees
that
that
does
not
constitute
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
but
that's
really
beside
the
point
when
we're
talking
about
an
exemption.
we
don't
need
to
get
to
the
merits
of
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes
sir,
i
understand.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
i
think
that's
right
your
honor
but
as
the
government
said
in
its
brief
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
or
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
to
protect
competition
not
competitors.
we
have
some
that
felt
that
they
could
accept
what
was
offered
by
blue
shield
and
we
have
some
that
felt
they
could
not.
therefore,
they
didn't
enter
to
the
pharmacy.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
if
there
was
incorporated
in
the
pharmacy
agreement,
so
our
position
that
the
pharmacy
agreement
constituting
a
part
of
the
“business
of
insurance”
that
that
would
be
exempt.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
oh,
no,
your
honor.
we're
talking
about
an
exemption
which
we're
talking
only
about
the
term
“business
of
insurance”
and
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
the
pharmacy
agreement
is
the
“business
of
insurance.”
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
well,
i
don't
like
the
way
it
sounds
but.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
well,
your
honor
i
don't
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
of
course
and
that
is
really
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
would
we
claim
that
to
be
the
business
of
insurance?
is
that
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
the
business
of
insurance
with
respect
to
a
provider
agreement
encompasses
only
those
provisions
which
directly
relate
to
the
delivery
of
the
goods
and
services
under
written
in
the
contract
and
only
those
provisions
which
directly
relate
to
the
cost
of
those
goods
and
services
delivered
to
the
insured.
as
i
said
earlier
an
insurance
company
might
put
a
number
of
non-cost
related
items
into
any
of
its
contracts
whether
they
are
policies
or
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no
sir,
i
think
that
would
be
too
far
removed
if
they
took
the
manufacturer?
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
totally
understanding
are
you
talking
about
a
manufacturer
or
a
pharmacist?
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
a
manufacturer,
your
honor
i
think
a
manufacturer
would
be
too
far
removed
to
come
within
the
scope
of
the
exemption
of
the
business
of
insurance
under
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
initially,
the
state
board
of
insurance
in
texas
absolutely
disapproved
the
issuance
on
use
of
the
policy.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
then
it
issued
an
order.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
to
prevent
a
competitive
disadvantage
with
a
foreign
insurance
carrier
who
was
carrying
on
the
same
business
in
texas
and
permitted
authorized
blue
shield
to
issue
and
use
this
policy
in
the
state
of
texas
specifically
referring
to
the
pharmacy
agreement
and
the
fact
that
blue
shield
would
enter
into
participating
providers
to
provide
dispensed
drugs
to
the
policyholders
under
the
terms
of
the
contract.
later
on
in
1974,
another
policy
form
was
submitted
to
the
state
board
of
insurance
identical
in
content
to
the
one
that
was
submitted
in
1969
and
the
state
board
unequivocally
approved
that
policy
for
issuance
in
use
in
the
state.
now,
with
respect
to
your
question
or
the
inference
of
exemption
your
honor
from
the
texas
antitrust
laws,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
approval
statutes
of
texas
and
we
do
require
that
only
policy
for
us
to
be
file
for
approval
prior
to
issuance
or
use.
but
if
the
commissioner
of
insurance
determines
that
a
policy
should
be
for
reasons
that
are
totally
discretionary
with
him
and
within
his
regulatory
capacity.
if
the
commissioner
determines
that
a
policy
maybe
issued
or
should
be
issued
and
use
within
the
state
then
he
may
exempt
that
policy
only
from
the
approval
requirement
--
a
very
limited
exemption.
subject
--
thereafter,
the
policy
is
subject
to
all
of
the
regulatory
authority,
all
of
the
regulatory
statutes
and
other
provisions
within
the
state
of
texas.
so,
there
was
no
exemption
from
regulation.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes
sir,
that's
exactly
correct.
we're
talking
about
two
separate
policies
that
were
submitted
to
the
state
board
of
insurance.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
we
have
one
policy
that's
being
issues
that
is
issued
under
an
exemption
order.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
and
one
policy
that's
being
issued
under
a
flat
approval
order
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
the
1974
policy
is
the
more
recent
and
it's
being
issued
under
an
approval
order
by
the
commission.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes
sir,
the
deputy
commissioner
of
insurance
testified
that
with
respect
to
--
there
is
no
difference
between
an
exempted
policy
and
an
approved
policy
as
it
applied
to
state
regulation.
they
are
regulated
and
identically
the
same
manner.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
it
consists
of
the
traditional
forms
of
prior
approval
of
policies.
the
traditional
forms
of
supervisory
regulation
such
as
continuing
financial
filings
regulation
of
the
internal
organization
of
the
company
but
more
importantly
in
texas,
we
have
an
unfair
trade
practices
act
which
is
very
broad
and
prohibits
virtually
every
type
of
an
unfair
trade
practice
that
is
imaginable.
it's
a
part
of
our
insurance
code.
in
addition,
the
texas
antitrust
laws
are
specifically
made
applicable
to
the
business
of
insurance.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
was
any
confusion
with
our
discussion
earlier
today
it
would
be
our
position
that
in
the
event
pharmacist
get
together
and
conspired
to
enter
into
a
pharmacy
agreement
and
came
the
blue
shield
and
told
us,
held
a
gun
to
our
head
so
to
speak
and
said
we're
not
going
to
enter
in
to
this
agreement
with
you
unless
you
pay
us
a
certain
price
and
that
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor
that
if
we
are
a
victim
of
a
conspiracy
---
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
under
those
--
like
we
have
two
different
circumstances
under
my
theory
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
alright
your
honor,
if
blue
shield
was
a
party
to
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
it
would
be
my
initial
impression
right
now
that
if
the
agreement
was
embodied
into
the
pharmacy
agreement
and
it
is
always
been
our
position
that
the
pharmacy
agreement
is
immune
as
a
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
well,
then
there
would
be
no
violation.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
for
the
separate
conspiracy
between
the
druggist
there
maybe
an
actionable
that
maybe
actionable
conspiracy.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
not
at
all,
your
honor
that
would
be
totally
against
our
own
interest
and
the
interest
of
our
policyholders.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
i
guess
that
is
the
possibility
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
i'm
not
familiar
with
anything
of
that
nature
that's
ever
happened.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
there's
considerable
dispute
about
that
but
as
i
read
the
cases
of
price
fixing
can
either
be
to
fix
maximum
prices
or
minimal
price.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
strictly
from
the
antitrust
from
an
act
standpoint.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
well,
i'm
operating
my
thoughts
are
under
the
theory
that
blue
shield
would
offer
this
agreement
to
everyone;
somewhat
to
possibly
be
able
to
accept
some
possibly
not.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
any
license
pharmacy
in
the
state
of
texas
has
been
invited
and
is
capable
of
becoming
a
participating
pharmacy.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
your
honor.
we
claim
that
we
--
it
must
be
constitute
a
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
and
the
activity
must
be
regulated
by
state
law.
and
we
believe
that
undeniably
has
in
this
case.
your
honor,
we
have
talked
considerably
today
about
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
reach
the
second
step.
however,
the
trial
court
found
that
it
had
been
regulated
in
its
words
pervasively.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
no
sir.
it
said
that,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
was
finding
at
the
pharmacy
agreement
did
not
constitute
business
of
insurance.
it
was
not
required
to
go
to
the
second
step
relating
to
state
regulation
nor
was
it
required
to
go
to
the
step
relating
to
boycott.
the
business
of
insurance
is
a
federal
question.
there
seems
to
have
been
considerable
discussions
today
about
the
state's
interests
and
whether
or
not
the
state
has
regulated
and
whether
or
not
the
state
considered
the
matter
to
be
the
business
of
insurance.
while
we
believe
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes
sir,
well,
i
just
want
to
make
our
point
clear.
we're
not
relying
upon
what
the
state
did
to
say
that
this
constitutes
the
business
of
insurance.
we're
relying
strictly
upon
a
federal
standard.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
my
position
would
still
be
the
same
your
honor.
the
business
of
insurance
is
a
federal
question.
if
it
happens
to
be
the
business
of
insurance
but
not
regulated,
the
exemption
does
not
attach.
although,
we
do
believe
that
federal
court
should
give
certain
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
i
think
its
still
would
be
a
federal
consideration,
your
honor.
the
business
of
insurance
is
a
federal
question
to
be
decided
by
the
federal
courts.
we
do
not
suggest
that
everything
in
insurance
company
does
constitutes
the
business
of
insurance.
an
insurance
company
may
do
many
things
in
the
conduct
of
its
business
which
are
not
directly
related
to
the
furnishing
of
specific
benefits
and
which
are
not
related
directly
to
the
cost
of
those
specific
benefits.
what
we
are
saying
in
our
position
here
today
is
that
the
pharmacy
agreement
directly
violates
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said
that
the
contracts
for
the
purchase
of
paper
(voice
overlap)
the
buildings
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
that
i
would
say
it
would
not
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
the
federal
courts
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
key
is
not
whether
or
not
it's
in
the
insurance
business
but
the
business
of
insurance
and
there's
a
difference
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
because
there
is
not
a
requisite
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
its
policyholder
in
that
situation.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
that
still
would
not
really
involve
the
claim
--
the
risk
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
too
attenuated
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
become
an
exempt
to
activity.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
if
it
was
an
obligation
contained
in
the
policy
of
insurance?
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
and
if
it
was
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
if
it
is
a
part
of
the
coverage
and
benefits
provided
by
the
policy
and
if
it
is
something
that
is
eminently
related
to
the
insured
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
i
think
it
might
be
your
honor.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
it's
the
difference
between
that.
the
conceptual
difference
between
the
two
types
of
cases
here,
i
agree
with
your
honor's
hypothesis.
i
think
i
agree
and
not
i
think
i
agree
but
i
do
agree.
however,
we're
looking
at
a
different
type
of
insurance
and
a
different
type
of
policy
here.
we're
looking
at
one
where
this
particular
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
if
the
insured?
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
would
constitute
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
well,
it
does
--
i
believe
that
it
would
fall
too
far
outside
the
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
the
assumption
of
risk
in
providing
a
benefit
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
i
don't
believe
it
would
fall
within
the
criteria
establish
by
this
court
in
sec
versus
national
securities.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
well,
your
honor,
this
court
set
out
--
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
set
out
some
very
broad
criteria
in
determining
what
constitutes
the
business
of
insurance
in
that
case
but
the
real
nexus
for
what
does
constitute
the
business
of
insurance
are
matters
that
intimately
relate
to
the
insurer-insured
relationship.
the
court
also
said
that
the
type
of
policy
which
could
be
issued
its
reliability,
interpretation
and
enforcement
and
other
activities
of
insurers
which
relate
closely
to
their
status
as
reliable
insurers
constitute
the
business
of
insurance
for
mccarran
purposes.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
your
honor,
there
was
the
preceding
case
in
1959
of
securities
and
exchange
commissioner
versus
variable
annuity
said,
that
the
merger
of
two
insurance
companies
even
though
the
sale
of
stock
or
the
holding
of
stock
involved
the
insureds
to
some
respect
said
that
that
was
not
sufficient
that
did
not
sufficiently
relate
to
the
insurer-insured
relationship.
and
i
think
your
proposition
of
that
going
out
and
borrowing
money
would
be
more
akin
to
the
variable
annuity
case.
mr.
keith
e.
kaiser
yes
sir.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
