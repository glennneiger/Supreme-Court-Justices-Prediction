william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
you
mr.
kaiser.
you
said
that
the
--
you
began
by
saying
there's
a
tripartite
situation
and
did
you
say
that
the
contract
between
your
client
blue
cross
and
--

blue
shield
and
the
insured
expressly
provides
that
blue
shield
shall
enter
into
a
contract
with
the
suppliers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
insurance
contract
if
blue
shield
itself
were
to
go
under
the
business
of
being
a
pharmacist
and
itself
provided
the
in
kind
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
reason
of
the
insurance
contract
contains
that
provisions
that
it
does
as
largely
and
historic
reason,
it's
not
essential
that
the
contract
be
that
way
that
is
if
you're
doing
it
now
from
scratch
but
there
are
historic
reasons
why
the
contract
is
as
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
matter
of
historic
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
real
reason
why
this
be
tripartite,
is
it,
is
there?
i
mean
no
reason
in
rationality
or
normally
when
the
insurance
said
benefits
are
in
terms
of
money
is
just
a
bipartite
agreement
--
bilateral
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
beneficiary
receives
money
directly
from
the
insurance
company.
there's
no
reason
why
it
shouldn't
receive
benefits
in
kind
directly
from
the
insurance
company
either
directly
of
through
a
subsidiary,
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
isn't
inexorably
a
tripartite
situation.
the
logic
doesn't
inexorably
require
that
it
be
a
tripartite
agreement
with
insurance
contract
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
what's
full
coverage
when
he
wants
money
too
when
he
has
liability
or
accident
insurance,
he
wants
full
coverage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
that
is
not
necessarily
tripartite
he
just
gets
the
money
from
the
insurance
company.
