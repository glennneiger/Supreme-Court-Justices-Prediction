mr.
kaiser,
suppose
you
have
five
drug
manufacturers,
who
deliberately
conspire
in
violation
of
every
antitrust
principle
in
the
world
to
run
up
the
price
of
at
least
all
and
that
it
put
in,
the
insurance
contract
is
protected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
protected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
telling
about
based
on
drugs.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
the
fact
that
--
they
deliberately
got
together
and
then
jacked
up
the
price
of
one
drug,
five
companies
in
deliberate
violation
of
antitrust
laws
and
insurance
company
took
that
price?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
manufacturer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
getting
back
to
the
drugs.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
interest
does
blue
shield
have
other
than
to
get
for
the
--
its
customers
the
lowest
price
drugs
they
can
get?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
give
me
one
other
interest
they
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
the
meantime
they
get
drugs
cheaper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
said
so
sir,
you
said
that
when
they
go
to
another
place
and
they
charge
more,
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
more
means
more,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
other
place
is
cheaper,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
cheaper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
persons
that's
buying
the
drugs
or
the
person
is
buying
the
insurance
is
getting
cheaper
drugs
at
a
cheaper
price,
and
that's
a
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
also
true
that
medicine
is
part
of
health?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
they
can
--
well,
as
the
paying
of
the
doctor's
bill
insurance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
the
doctors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
under
the
group
health
plan
it
wouldn't
be
covered,
wouldn't
the
insurance
would
because
they
pay
the
doctors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
pay
the
doctors.
the
group
health
hires
the
doctor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
wouldn't
be
insurance
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wouldn't
be
--
they
wouldn't
be
covered
by
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
the
state
says
that
the
dealing
in
drugs
is
not
an
insurance
function
and
therefore
we
will
not
regulate
it.
then,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
they
said
it
was
and
they
did
move
and
it
would
be
a
very
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
said
it
was
an
insurance
problem
and
did
regulate
it,
it
would
not
be
a
federal?
you
don't
go
that
way,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
real
answer
is,
to
my
brother
stevens'
question
is
that
the
further
we
take
you
away
from
this
case
and
your
theory
of
the
less
certain
you
get.
