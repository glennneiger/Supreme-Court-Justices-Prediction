chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
952,
group
life
and
health
insurance
against
royal
drug.
mr.
kaiser,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
fair
to
say
in
broader
terms
and
you
cast
it
that
this
was
a
response
to
the
demand
of
consumers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me,
but
it
wouldn't
be
limited
to
just
the
automobile
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kaiser,
you
cannot
distinguish
between
the
variants
and
the
case
justice
stevens
opposed
was
services,
here
it's
goods.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
unless
someone
can
distinguish
between
those
two
variants
from
the
normal
concept
of
insurance
that's
very
strongly
in
your
favor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
true
that
some
forms,
some
policies
of
insurance
beside
replacing
the
casualty
loss,
fire
or
whatever
also
provide
a
fixed
amount
for
the
lawsuit
profits
during
the
period
when
the
building
or
the
plant
or
the
factory
is
being
rehabilitated
and
you
certainly
would
not
say
that
that
takes
that
out
of
the
business
of
insurance
because
it
goes
that
far,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
action
of
the
pharmacy
trade
association
that
justice
stevens
postulated
their
own
action
independent
to
whatever
success
they
--
whatever
agreements
they
had
with
the
insurance
company?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
mean
that
their
action
in
agreeing
to
fix
prices
would
be
completely
immune
when
you're
just
talking
about
all
the
drug
companies.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
postulated
that
a
group
of
the
drug
suppliers
got
together
and
entered
what
amount
and
i
took
it
to
be
a
price-fixing
agreement.
now,
if
it
stopped
right
there,
isn't
that
a
violation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
blue
shield
is
not
the
part
of
that
consortium
at
that
stage.
now,
blue
shield
might
conceivably
have
to
yield
to
it
ultimately
but
they're
not
part
of
any
agreement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
blue
shield
itself
might
be
a
victim
of
that
price-fixing
agreement
if
they
couldn't
buy
any
where
else
but
suppose
it
was
so
pervasive
that
it
covered
that
whole
round
of
suppliers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
you
will
have
antitrust
violation
and
wouldn't
you
conceivably?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
kaiser.
mr.
pullen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
weren't
they
--
weren't
the
policyholders
simply
in
the
open
market
they
brought
drugs
and
paid
the
first
$2.00
as
i
understand
it
on
each
proscription.
and
then
whatever
the
price
was
they
paid
the
differential?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
--
you
say
that
penalizes
the
pharmacy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anybody
can
get
in
that
participation,
can't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
a
factor
of
the
predictability
of
prices
that
goes
into
the
actuarial
activities
of
the
insurance
company
involved
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
must
know
reasonably
what
the
exposure
of
risks
amounts
to.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
they're
at
the
mercy
of
any
one
who
wants
to
charge
a
higher
price
they
can't
predict
the
prices,
can
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
participating
druggists
manage
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
economics,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
here
that
would
indicate
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
approach
to
this
thing
although
in
some
business
they're
not
involved
in
this
case,
if
you
carried
it
to
its
logical
conclusion
you'd
undermine
the
whole
cooperative
movement
in
the
united
states,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
produce
bargain
for
the
lowest
prices
and
limit
the
areas
of
their
purchase,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they've
coupled
the
cooperative
concept
with
the
business
of
insurance
or
made
it
part
they
say
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock
counsel.
[lunch
recess]
counsel,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps,
we'll
have
to
decide
that
when
we
examine
it
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now,
you
suggest
that
they
approve
only
the
terms
of
the
policy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
commission
had
before
it
exactly
the
interpretation
of
the
insurer
as
to
the
scope
of
that
policy
and
the
meaning
of
the
language
of
policy,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
they
can
tell
them,
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
are
you
talking
about
the
participating
pharmacy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
participating
pharmacy
it
doesn't
have
to
participate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pullen,
tell
me
specifically,
what's
wrong
with
that
in
your
view
in
antitrust
terms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
price
fixing
to
take
your
terms
in
a
sense
that
the
participating
druggist
agreed
to
sell
at
a
lower
price.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
lower
price
solved
ore
you
wouldn't
be
here
i
assume?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
pullen.
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
not
be,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
your
response
to
what
we
suggested
this
morning
on
the
universal
practice
of
public
liability
insurance
insuring
not
only
against
the
risk
of
ultimate
judgment
against
the
policyholder
but
the
cost
of
litigation,
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
provision
in
the
policy
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
responded
to
that
this
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
kaiser
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
mr.
kaiser
this
morning
when
i
put
the
question
to
him
to
say
that
the
action
of
the
drugs
--
drug
people
together
independent
of
the
agreement
with
blue
shield
could
be
an
antitrust
violation
and
one
of
the
ways
that
could
be
asserted
would
be
for
blue
shield
to
sue
them
because
they
were
pushing
the
price
up;
price
fixing
agreement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
know
his
response
to
that
was
that
would
not
render
them.
it
might
be
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
as
between
blue
shield
and
the
druggist
but
it
wouldn't
render
the
druggist
immune
from
an
antitrust
violation
for
their
own
agreement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
that
very
clearly
that
it
was
his
position.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
allen.
you
have
some
time
left
mr.
kaiser.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
blue
shield
is
at
least
an
ordinary
human
experience
isn't
as
likely
to
--
isn't
very
likely
to
enter
into
conspiracy
to
raise
their
own
costs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
the
hypothesis
is
at
least
economically
not
very
real?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
limitation
now,
can
anyone
be
a
participant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
kaiser.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
952,
group
life
&
health
insurance
company
against
royal
drug
company
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
