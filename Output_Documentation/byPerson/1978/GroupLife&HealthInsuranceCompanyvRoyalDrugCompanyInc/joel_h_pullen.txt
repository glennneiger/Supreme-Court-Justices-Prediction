mr.
joel
h.
pullen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
set
this
case
in
the
proper
pattern.
we
do
not
here
have
the
policy
of
insurance
which
in
any
way
mentions
the
price
fixing
aspects
about
which
we
complain.
all
the
policy
provides
with
respect
to
who
is
a
participating
pharmacist
is
that
he
is
someone
who
has
agreed
to
furnish
covered
drugs
to
blue
shield's
insured.
there
is
nothing
said
about
the
agreement
with
the
pharmacy
beyond
that
language.
and
this
is
the
policy
that
was
exempted
and
this
is
the
policy
that
was
subsequently
approved
at
nowhere
in
the
process
however
was
the
pharmacy
agreement
considered
or
approved
or
anything
done
to
it
rather
than
the
fact
then
it
was
mailed
to
austin,
to
the
state
board
of
insurance.
they
took
it
and
they
didn't
send
it
back.
it's
not
marked
filed,
it
is
marked
for
informational
purposes
only.
when
we
took
their
positions
of
the
people
at
the
state
board,
i
asked
them
specifically,
“do
you
claim
any
jurisdiction
over
pharmacists?”
their
answer
was,
“no.”
i
said,
“do
you
regulate
this
pharmacy
agreement
in
any
manner
and
they
said,
“no.”
and
i
said,
“why
not?”
and
they
said,
“because
it's
not
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
in
texas.”
so,
we
have
today
presented
to
the
court
a
question
which
is
basically
not
the
situation
that
the
mccarran
act
was
designed
to
reach.
we
have
no
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
excuse
me.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
believe
that
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
asked
question,
so
that
the
record
will
be
clear.
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
state
board
of
insurance
under
the
regulatory
authority
granted
it
under
the
texas
insurance
code
has
authority
to
regulate
contracts
between
a
company
such
as
blue
shield
and
an
independent
pharmacy?
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
answer:
my
personal
opinion
is
that
this
particular
contract
that
you
showed
me,
then
i
said
you're
talking
about
the
deposition
exhibit
3,
the
pharmacy
agreement.
he
said,
“right,
would
be
contract
between
an
entity
and
a
provider.”
which
would
not
be
part
of
the
original
or
full
contract
of
insurance.
the
contract
would
be
filed
with
us
for
informational
purposes
which
would
be
part
of
a
plan
of
operations.
but
when
we
get
an
entire
plan
of
operation
then
there
are
certain
aspects
of
it
that
we
file
such
as
the
pharmacy
agreement
certain
aspects
of
it
that
we
approved.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
believe
if
you
look
at
the
contract
your
honor
and
we
covered
this
in
our
brief.
the
contract
again
there
refers
to
an
agreement
to
supply
covered
drugs.
it
does
not
say
anything
about
the
price
fixing
agreement
of
what
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
talking
about
two
things,
texas
law
has
no
provision
which
provides
for
approval
of
the
pharmacy
agreement.
it
provides
for
approval
of
policy
forms
and
the
policy
form
here
which
the
state
has
permitted
to
use
does
not
include
the
price
fixing
aspect
of
the
pharmacy
agreement.
if
all
we
had
here
was
an
agreement
that
was
consistent
with
the
policy,
we
would
not
be
here
because
the
issue
would
not
have
come
up
because
all
they
would've
ask
the
pharmacy
is,
“will
you
furnish
covered
drugs
to
our
insured?”
well,
obviously,
they
will.
what
is
bad
about
it,
it
goes
beyond
the
policy
terms
and
they
knew
it.
in
fact,
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no,
your
honor.
i
still
think
that
that
would
be
a
situation
where
this
court
could
determine
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
is
a
federal
statute
what
from
mccarran-ferguson
act
purposes
under
federal
law
constitutes
the
“business
of
insurance.”
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
that
was
mr.
ferguson
who
was
the
--
i
believe
the
assistant
manager
of
the
department
of
policy
regulation.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no,
your
honor.
but
he
is
the
man
who
regulates
the
policy.
he
is
the
man
who
actually
determines
what
policy
are
approved
and
which
are
disapproved.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no
your
honor,
it
was
given
after
the
approval.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
well,
the
commission
only
approves
policy
forms.
it
does
not
approve
or
disapprove
the
pharmacy
agreement.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no
your
honor,
apparently
i
did
not
make
myself
clear.
the
only
agreement
to
which
the
policy
form
refers
is
an
agreement
with
a
pharmacy
that
it
will
furnish
covered
drugs.
it
says
nothing
about
the
price
at
which
they
will
be
furnished
and
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
in
other
words
--
but
the
only
thing
there
your
honor
again,
nothing
in
the
policy
itself
refers
to
a
price
fixing
agreement.
it
refers
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
now,
i
would
like
to
also
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
blue
shield?
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no,
your
honor.
and
that's
an
important
part
of
this
case.
the
policy
provides
that
if
an
insured
patronizes
a
participating
pharmacist
which
is
defined
is
someone
who
has
agreed
to
furnish
covered
drugs.
the
policyholder
pays
the
deductible
and
blue
shield
pays
the
rest.
now,
that
is
not
how
it
operates
in
practice
but
first
of
all
to
get
back
--
to
stay
on
your
question
your
honor
if
he
goes
to
a
non-participating
pharmacist
who
has
defined
to
someone
who
has
not
agreed
to
furnish
covered
drug.
that's
the
only
test
and
price
is
not
to
think.
then
the
policyholder
still
pays
his
$2.00
but
it's
done
in
a
different
manner.
he
pays
the
cost
to
the
pharmacist.
he
then
sends
his
claim
to
blue
shield.
blue
shield
then
deducts
the
$2.00
deductible
but
penalizes
the
pharmacy
and
only
reimburses
him
75%
of
a
reasonable
charge
as
determined
by
blue
shield.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes
sir.
well,
it
penalizes
the
insured
who
in
turn
learned
very
quickly
that
he
had
better
go
to
a
blue
shield
pharmacy
who
signed
this
agreement.
i
think
it's
extremely
significant
in
this
case
that
in
1975
when
we
took
the
deposition
in
october
over
98%
of
the
31,000
claims
a
month
which
were
filled
in
texas
under
this
type
of
coverage
went
to
participating
pharmacists
and
i
think
the
significance
of
that
it
shows
the
coercive
effect,
it
certainly
shows
a
boycott
and
i
think
the
question
that
was
raised
earlier
of
does
the
boycott
exemption
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case,
i
think
it
does
very
strongly
because
what
this
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
because
your
honor
what
the
effect
of
the
policy
is
to
allocate
the
business
of
blue
shield
insurers
to
those
pharmacists
who
have
agreed
to
fix
prices
with
blue
shield.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes
sir
and
it's
consistent
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
your
honor
but
that's
not
the
problem.
the
problem
is
if
you
don't
get
in,
if
you
try
and
have
a
free
market
transaction
with
your
customer
blue
shield
then
exerts
this
effort
on
his
customer.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
well,
we're
talking
about
the
boycott
provision
and
the
exemption
your
honor
which
i
say
is
a
matter
that
this
court
should
consider.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i'm
not
familiar
without
the
bank
of
americard
could
work.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
think
that's
true
your
honor
but
let's
look
at
this
transaction
and
i
think
it
will
be
very
quickly
demonstrated.
if
pharmacist
is
in
business
to
sell
drugs
in
pharmaceuticals,
a
customer
comes
in.
he's
had
a
prescription
from
his
doctor
that
the
pharmacist
wants
to
fill
and
the
customer
wants
filled.
the
pharmacist
fills
that
prescription;
he
gives
him
a
bill
for
his
normal
charge
for
it.
blue
shield
says
that
we
have
some
particular
interest
in
that
transaction
even
though
it's
a
transaction
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
pharmacy
business
which
occurs
everyday.
they
say,
“you're
dealing
with
our
insured”
and
apparently
their
feeling
is
that
they
have
some
sort
of
vested
interest
in
that
insured.
and
that
therefore,
they
can
determine
at
what
price
the
pharmacy
will
sell
the
drug
to
his
customer
and
i
don't
think
the
court
should
be
misled
that
this
case
in
the
court's
decision
is
going
to
be
limited
to
pharmacist.
if
this
action
if
the
“business
of
insurance”
it
is
going
to
be
the
“business
of
insurance”
or
similar
actions
in
every
aspect
of
our
society
where
insurance
is
written.
home,
fire
insurance
companies
can
have
participating
construction
agreements.
automobile
company
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
don't
know
that
that's
their
interest,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
think
their
interest
basically
is
to
increase
the
amount
of
money
which
they
will
retain
out
of
the
transaction.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
that
is
questionable.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
they
do
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
did
use
that
your
honor
but
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
it
maybe
as
to
a
blue
shield
customer
and
the
way
that
it
operates,
i
would
say
yes
it
is
cheaper.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
that's
a
crime
at
all.
what
i
say
is
that
it
takes
the
transaction
out
of
the
competitive
process.
and
it
allows
the
insurance
company
rather
than
the
free
market
place
which
this
court
have
been
very
eager
to
protect
and
rightfully
so
it
takes
that
transaction
out
of
the
market
place
transaction.
now,
following
along
and
this
with
the
question
that
in
my
analysis
of
this
case
i
became
concern
about.
i
said,
is
the
insurance
company
--
let's
reverse
it.
are
they
to
be
so
to
speak
a
target
for
whatever
the
drug
is
one
to
charge?
well,
clearly
not;
they
have
a
way
to
protect
themselves
sales
and
they
can
protect
themselves
within
what
is
traditionally
been
recognized
is
the
insurance
relationship
in
their
contract
with
their
insured.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no,
they
can't
predict
the
price
but
they
can
by
specifying
in
their
contract
what
they're
going
to
pay
predict
their
exposure
on
which
their
premium
is
based.
and
they
can
do
it
much
better
if
they
did
it
that
way
because
in
that
manner
they
could
also
cover
the
cost
of
drugs.
we
have
cited
statistics
which
show
the
drug
cost
the
part
at
which
and
all
we
get
from
blue
shield
is
our
acquisition
cost
of
the
drug.
we
have
shown
statistics
that
those
cost
they're
going
up
59%
if
pharmacist's
total
drug
cost
--
total
cost
a
furnishing
service
is
only
up
28%.
if
they
were
truly
concern
with
maximum
control
they
would
regulate
the
drug
cost.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
that
is
the
question,
your
honor.
many
tell
me
they
cannot
continue
to
function
and
furnish
competition
in
services
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
there
in
some
of
the
deposition
testimony
of
some
of
the
plaintiffs
in
my
case,
i
believe
you
will
find
that
your
honor
because
there
was
inquiry
about
what's
wrong
of
which
you're
getting
and
they
say
it's
too
low.
there's
also
a
letter
in
the
record
that
says
the
price
is
too
low.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
your
honor
but
i
think
here
we're
looking
at
something
into
determine
not
the
cooperative
movement
but
the
“business
of
insurance.”
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
well,
i
would
disagree
with
that
statement.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
they
--
as
i
recall
your
honor
they
were
submitted
with
one
of
them
and
maybe
near
on
this.
i
think
with
regard
to
the
first
exemption
order
that
the
pharmacy
agreement
was
submitted.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
in
1974,
i
do
not
recall.
i
recall
a
letter
in
the
record
which
is
i
with
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
would
still
say
your
honor
that
all
that
would
be
approved
would
be
the
policy
because
that's
all
the
state
has
authority
to
approve
under
the
specifically
under
statute.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
your
honor,
this
was
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
deposition
is
before
that
was
before
the
court
and
this
court.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
don't
think
he
did
so
too
clearly
and
there
is
some
debate
about
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
all
right.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
your
honor,
my
reading
of
mr.
ferguson's
testimony
was
that
this
came
in
they
did
put
it
the
file
although
they
did
not
stamp
it
filed
it
i
will
just
the
matter
which
they
received
for
informational
purposes.
as
i
read
his
testimony,
it
is
even
though
i
may
read
this
and
examine
it,
i
have
no
jurisdiction
over
it.
and
that,
i
believe
is
what
he
said
as
the
record
will
reflect.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
was
it
ultimately
decided?
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
it
could
be
your
honor.
i
don't
think
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
it
has
to
be.
i
think
because
the
statute
is
clear.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no,
i
am
relying
on
deposition
very
much
so.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
state
statute
and
when
you
look
at
the
texas
state
statute
when
it
talks
about
what
will
be
filed,
it
is
insurance
policy
forms.
and
this
is
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
when
i
first
opened
my
argument
that
that's
all
the
statute
provides
texas
has
regulatory
authority
over.
there
is
nothing
in
the
texas
statute
and
there's
nothing
it's
been
cited
to
this
court
that
shows
any
authority
of
the
state
to
approve
the
pharmacy
agreement.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no
sir,
i
think
it
helps
considerably
because
he's
the
man
who
is
enforcing
the
texas
law
and
this
is
how
it
does
operate.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
in
answer
to
justice
marshall's
question
before
lunch
about
whether
prices
would
increase.
the
pharmacy
dispensing
fee
of
$2.00
was
fixed
in
1969.
there
were
no
studies
at
that
time
to
determine
whether
that
was
adequate.
there
had
been
no
studies
since
to
determine
whether
it
is
adequate.
our
position
is
that
we
wish
to
compete.
we
wish
to
have
our
prices
set
subject
to
the
competitive
forces.
they
may
increase
if
this
agreement
is
held
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
our
competition
may
keep
them
from
increasing
but
it
would
be
the
competitive
factor
in
our
society
which
would
determine
that.
i
would
like
to
also
spend
a
little
time
talking
about
the
type
of
policy
we
have
here.
despite
the
terms
that
counsel
for
blue
shield
has
used,
it
is
purely
and
simply
an
indemnity
type
of
policy.

michigan
contract,
they
say
blue
shield
is
not
a
party
to
this
drug
sale.
the
walgreen
contract
in
texas
which
is
the
203
of
the
appendix,
says
blue
shield
is
the
underwriter
of
insurance
protection
only.
on
page
182
(a)
of
the
appendix
which
is
a
form
letter
for
blue
shield
it
talks
about
how
they
will
make
payment.
and
that
basically,
is
what
we
have
here.
the
compensation
to
the
pharmacy
is
fixed
at
one
level
for
all
pharmacies.
the
net
result
of
this
and
particularly
since
it
stayed
the
same
since
1969
except
and
this
is
not
in
the
record.
i
think
it
did
go
up
to
two
and
a
quarter
after
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
it
is
our
position
that
this
eliminates
competition
in
the
retain
sales
of
drugs
and
pharmaceuticals
not
only
price
competition
but
service
competitions.
our
client
say,
“we
cannot
operate
and
compete
fully.”
we
cannot
compete
in
the
area
of
services.
we
cannot
compete
in
the
area
of
hours.
and
the
test
is
also
is
a
significant
factor
but
it
also
shows
in
my
opinion
that
that
transaction
and
question
is
purely
and
simply
a
business
transaction
between
a
pharmacist
and
his
customer.
blue
shield
goes
further
and
say,
“that
customer
happens
to
be
an
insured
of
ours.”
so,
therefore
mr.
pharmacist
we
contend
you
what
to
charge
him
and
we
can
make
it
stick
and
they
can
and
they
have.
they
have
entered
into
a
conspiracy
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
no,
your
honor,
but
this
is
where
the
percentage
comes
in
because
what
they
do
the
way
the
program
is
set
up
with
the
non-participating
pharmacist
and
the
penalty
that
an
insured
suffers
if
he
deals
with
a
non-participating
pharmacist.
it
teaches
that
insured
very
quickly
that
if
he
wants
to
get
the
maximum
reimbursement
he
has
to
go
where
the
price
agreement
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
your
honor,
in
my
opinion,
that
is
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
and
it
is
a
boycott
and
it
is
a
conspiracy
to
boycott
and
it's
been
very
successful.
the
figures
show
blue
shield's
own
figures
showed
that
98%
of
their
customer's
business
goes
to
the
participating
pharmacist.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
at
one
fixed
price
your
honor.
it
may
--
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
well,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
again
and
apparently
for
the
second
time
i
have
not
articulated
it
very
well
is
that
the
ultimate
price
which
their
customers
will
find
acceptable
will
be
a
price
fixed
by
competition.
we
could
very
well
be
successful
in
this
case
and
then
find
that
our
customers
will
not
pay
any
more
than
the
$2.00.
and
in
fact,
they'll
pay
less
but
nevertheless
it
is
the
competition
that
is
important
under
the
sherman
act
and
that
that
is
where
the
price
fixing
should
be
determined
not
by
this
type
of
agreement.
we
have
here
an
agreement,
it
is
not
been
approved
by
any
state
regulatory
authority.
in
michigan,
blue
shield
is
not
an
insurance
company.
in
fact,
in
the
demo
case
which
we're
citing
in
michigan,
the
commissioner
of
insurance
who
while
he
has
regulatory
powers,
it
is
not
insurance
regulatory
power
tried
to
regulate
their
rates
to
help
them
on
hospital
utilization.
they
have
fought
it
all
the
way
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
and
they're
still
fighting
and
they
say
to
him
that,
“that's
not
your
business,
that's
our
business.”
that's
not
anything
that
you
have
regulatory
authority
over.
in
texas,
it's
even
clear
because
the
statutes
says
what
the
state
what
the
state
reviews
and
it
does
not
list
pharmacy
agreements
of
this
type.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
understand
that
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
that
is
my
understanding
your
honor.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
that
would
be
certainly
my
understanding.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
i
have
some
question
about
it
your
honor
in
looking
at
the
mccarran
act
legislative
history.
the
court
in
my
opinion
was
talking
about
affirmative
acts
of
state
regulation
because
they
talk
about
agreements
which
the
public
authority
has
approved.
on
this
point,
mr.
kaiser
mentioned
the
texas
article
21
and
21
of
the
unfair
labor
practices.
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
and
cited
the
texas
case
that
that
would
not
apply
to
us
because
we
have
no
insurance
policy.
we
are
just
selling
to
someone
who
has.
and
i
don't
think
that
would
apply
to
us.
obviously,
blue
shield
if
they're
going
to
be
in
court
would
rather
be
under
the
texas
antitrust
act.
and
we
do
have
one
and
there's
no
question
about
it
but
it
is
not
been
one
that
has
been
used
for
damage
suits
and
it
is
considerably
less
severe
in
the
recovery
to
a
plaintiff.
i
have
some
question
about
whether
an
antitrust
statute
which
would
apply
on
and
after
the
fact
basis
and
perhaps
never
be
invoked
a
private
plaintiff
is
the
type
of
regulation
that
the
mccarran
act
is
intended
to.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
as
compared
to
just
regulation
of
business
in
general?
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
h.
pullen
to
continue
your
honor,
the
matter
is
not
one
sided.
if
contracts
for
the
sale
of
merchandise
to
people
who
have
insurance
coverage
do
broadly
constitute
the
business
of
insurance,
the
situation
may
turn
to
a
horrible
type
of
thing.
for
example,
if
one
of
these
contracts
automatically
is
within
the
business
of
insurance
and
exempts
to
antitrust
violations
could
the
pharmacist
get
together
with
a
small
insurance
company
acquire
control
over
it
and
then
say
the
blue
shield,
“we'll
were
sorry
gentlemen
we're
dealing
with
this
insurance
company
and
we're
not
going
to
deal
with
you
and
we
don't
have
a
boycott
because
there
are
other
people
out
here
and
they
may
deal
with
you
but
we're
only
going
to
service
the
customers
of
these
other
insurance
companies.
and
we're
not
going
to
give
any
service
to
your
insureds
and
we're
not
going
to
reimburse
our
insureds
for
dealing
with
other
people.”
i
believe
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you
your
honor.
