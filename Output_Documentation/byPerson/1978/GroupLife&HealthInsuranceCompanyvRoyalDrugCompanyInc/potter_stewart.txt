since,
blue
shield
prescription
couldn't
have
its
own
drugstores
under
the
insurance
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
might
well
encompass
a
provider
agreement
when
the
agreement
involves
the
provision
of
legal
services
to
somebody
who
sued
as
the
result
of
the
automobile
accident.
i
don't
see
why
you
run
away
from
that,
that
helps
you,
it
doesn't
hurt
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
won't
if
i
were
you.
but
you
can
indicate
all
you
want
but
not
on
this
basis
because
that's
on
your
favor.

boycott
exception.
so,
it
really
doesn't
have
any
bearing.
it
doesn't
have
direct
bearing?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
say
some
about
the
price
that
which
they
will
be
furnished
to
the
beneficiaries
to
which
the
drugs
will
be
furnished
by
the
beneficiary.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
not
all
concern
here
with
the
merits
of
the
antitrust
claim
but
merely
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
under
the
statutory
exemption.
and
to
be
under
the
statutory
exemption
the
defendant,
defendants
rather
have
to
be
first
in
the
business
of
insurance
and
second,
not
regulated
by
state
law
and
third,
where
interstate
of
the
merits
to
this
extent
that
you
whether
or
not
you've
alleged
the
boycott?
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
many
exemption
and
that's
all
but
we're
not
interested
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
doesn't
have
the
record
to
regulate
under
its
insurance
commissioner;
it
can
regulate
through
his
antitrust
laws
or
any
other
way.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
section
2
(b)
has
no
such
limiting
language
and
that's
the,
i
thought
that's
the
exempt
section
that
was
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
state
regulation
doesn't
have
to
authorize
that
just
as
to
be
state
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
language
to
which
my
brother
stevens
adverted
in
section
2
(b)
i'd
already
understood
as
referring
to
none
preemption
prior
to
june
30,
1948.
and
the
general
exempted
language
i
thought
was
in
the
latter
part
of
2
(b)
--
justice
potter
stewart
after
june
30
of
1948?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
forgetting
any
problems
of
legal
ethics
or
anything,
what
if
an
insurance
company
just
had
a
stable
of
lawyers,
its
employees
that
it
furnished
under
its
insurance
contracts
to
beneficiaries
who
were
sued
for
liability,
would
those
employment
contracts
with
the
lawyers
pay
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
not
clear,
then
why
is
it
so
clear
that
if
the
insurance
company
does
the
same
thing
with
independent
contracts
is
it
all
of
a
sudden
becomes
very
clear?
justice
potter
stewart
in
each
case,
the
insurance
--
the
insurer
is
furnishing
the
services
and
what
difference
has
it
whether
so
far
as
this
exemption
goes
whether
it
does
so
through
its
employees
or
through
independent
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
make
the
labor
relations
agreements,
they're
employment
contract,
no
point
in
giving
out
a
fancy
name.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
point
is
that
now
we
have
an
agreement
with
them
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
pharmacist
to
provide
services
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
is
the
business
of
insurance.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
perhaps
that's
the
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
sort
of
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
exactly
an
exemption
means
that
you
can
violate,
you
can
engage
in
conduct
which
would
be
violated
of
the
antitrust
laws
if
you
didn't
have
an
exemption.
that's
exactly
what
his
position
is.
justice
potter
stewart
except
that
a
business,
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
true
that
the
exemption
however
exist
only
at
the
exemption
for
the
business
of
insurance
exist
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
regulated
by
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
and
your
opponent
in
part
2
i
think
it
is
what
the
brief
asserts
that
this
is
not
regulated
by
state
law.
so,
that's
reason
that
became
relevant
as
i
understood
that
relevance
of
that
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
federal
standard
upon
that
federal
standard
is
that
the
business
of
insurance
has
to
be
regulated
by
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
would
some
of
those
things
be
--
let's
assume
a
company
that's
an
insurance
company
nothing
else
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
conglomerate
or
anything.
so,
only
in
the
insurance
business
now,
what
would
all
--
what
are
those
many
things
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
can
that
be
the
building
of
insurance?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
in
the
insurance
business
then
it
has
to
buy
paper.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
in
the
business
of
insurance
and
then
conducting
at
business
it
has
to
have
policies?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
written
or
printed
on
paper
and
why
therefore,
shouldn't
its
purchase
of
paper
be
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
we're
back
where
we
started.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
respondents,
18
owners
of
independent
pharmacies
in
san
antonio,
texas
brought
an
antitrust
action
in
a
federal
district
court
against
the
petitioners,
group
life
&
health
insurance
company,
known
as
blue
shield
of
texas,
and
three
pharmacies
also
doing
business
in
san
antonio.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
defendants
had
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
by
entering
agreements
to
fix
the
retail
prices
of
drugs
and
pharmaceuticals
and
that
the
activities
of
the
defendants
had
caused
blue
shield's
policyholders
not
to
deal
with
certain
of
the
plaintiffs
thereby
constituting
an
unlawful
group
boycott.
the
trial
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
defendants
on
the
ground
that
the
challenge
agreements
are
totally
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
because
the
agreements
are
the
business
of
insurance.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
the
judgment
holding
that
the
agreements
in
question
are
not
the
business
of
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
that
act.
we
granted
certiorari
because
of
inter-circuit
conflicts
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
"business
of
insurance"
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
the
issue
is
an
important
one
in
the
--
both
the
court's
opinion
and
the
dissenting
are
quite
lengthy
but
i
think
little
purpose
would
be
served
by
length
the
oral
announcement.
suffice
it
to
say
that
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
powell
have
joined.
