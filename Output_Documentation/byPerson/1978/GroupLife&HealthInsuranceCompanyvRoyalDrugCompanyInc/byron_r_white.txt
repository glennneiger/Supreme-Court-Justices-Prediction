mr.
kaiser
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
testimony
referred
to
on
page
28
of
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
he
say
it's
not
part
of
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
reading
that
but
why
did
the
commission
report
to
approve
a
contract
in
1974?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
say
anything
about
the
cost
to
the
insurance
company
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
in
terms
of
the
seller
is
the
price
to
the
insurance
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
assuming
you're
right
that
these
provider
agreements
are
not
regulated
by
the
state,
well
doesn't
section
2
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
say
that
the
sherman
act
does
apply
to
the
extent
the
state
doesn't
regulate
of
certain
phases
in
the
insurance
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
even
if
you
might
consider
for
purposes
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
these
provider
agreements
to
be
within
the
contemplation
of
the
word
“insurance”
but
other
words
insurance
business.
the
sherman
act
to
nevertheless
apply
in
texas
if
texas
didn't
regulate
those
agreements.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
purport
to
regulate
them
at
all
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
true
that
all
the
state
law
would
have
to
do
is
purport
to
regulate
provider
agreements?
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
a
specific
action
of
the
state
authority
on
a
specific
provider
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
even
if
the
provider
agreement
was
in
violation
of
state
law
you
have
to
leave
the
policing
up
to
the
state
authority,
it's
not
with
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
the
first
part
of
2
(b)
would
set
aside
any
state
law
that
was
in
conflict
with
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
antitrust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
would
not
apply
if
it
serve
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
supersede
a
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
first
part
of
2
(b)
would
give
insurance
business
exemption
from
antitrust
laws
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
why
do
you
say
it's
a
latter
part?
only
the
latter
part.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
first
thing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
sherman
act
and
every
other
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
also
includes
the
robinson-patman
act
the
first
part
of
2
(b)
and
which
is
not
referred
to
and
that
exempts
in
the
proviso?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
don't
seriously
contend
that
the
promise
to
furnish
to
defend
that
person
in
a
case
of
an
accident
is
not
insurance.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
then,
i
wouldn't
think
you
would
think
--
if
there's
been
an
accident
the
companies
called
upon
to
furnish
the
legal
services
that
were
promised.
you
wouldn't
think
furnishing
the
legal
service
was
not
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they're
going
to
furnish
to
legal
service
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
for
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
if
the
insurance
company
goes
out
to
an
independent
law
firm
and
hires
them
to
furnish
the
services
that
were
promised;
the
furnishing
of
those
services
is
part
of
insurance
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
said
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
you
wouldn't
think
that
the
negotiation
the
price
at
which
that
they
were
furnished
was
part
of
the
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not
draw
the
line
and
say
well,
perhaps
that
piecemeal
negotiation
is
one
thing
but
a
forward
contract,
they're
sort
of
a
supply
contract
in
the
indefinite
future
is
something
different.
you
don't
think
that
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
blue
shield
joined
the
conspiracy?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
they
are
party
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
i
know
but
i'm
asking
about
mine
now.
how
about
blue
shield
is
party
to
the
conspiracy?
justice
byron
r.
white
remember
they
are
carrying
out
the
business
of
insurance
according
to
your
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
blue
shield
would
be
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
and
but
nevertheless
i
suppose
you
say
the
druggist
--
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
they
get
together
to
keep
blue
shield
from
going
too
low
and
blue
shield
gets
paid
off
in
some
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
has
been
true,
hasn't
it
in
some
places?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
the
court
below
did
not
reach
the
second
step.
they
just
simply
said,
it's
not
the
business
of
insurance.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
that
second?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
about
the
paper
used
for
--
that
that
they
send
out
to
the
policyholder
to
submit
claims
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
condition
of
the
policy
is
that
you
file
a
claim
on
this
form?
