justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
couldn't
be
full
coverage
if
there
is
$2.00
deductible?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
isn't
full
coverage,
is
it?
there's
a
$2.00
deductible?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
that's
not
full
coverage
then
is
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
how
is
this
any
different
in
the
old-fashioned
automobile
policy
in
which
reliability
policy
which
insurance
company
agrees
to
provide
the
defense
if
the
insured
gets
sued
and
the
company
then
hires
lawyers
to
represent
the
policyholder
and
provides
in
effect
the
benefit
in
kind
to
the
services
of
the
lawyer?
and
therefore,
enters
into
agreements
with
the
lawyers
to
work
in
such
a
rate
and
be
available
and
so
forth.
isn't
that
just
like
this?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
contractual
arrangement
between
the
liability
insurance
carrier
and
the
lawyer
who
defense
cases
from
time
to
time
for
the
benefit
of
the
policy
holder.
why
is
that
any
different
or
is
it
any
different
from
an
agreement
between
the
health
insurance
carrier
and
a
drug
company
will
provide
drugs?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
correct.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
no
difference
and
so
this
case
would
be
and
if
you're
correct
and
you
may
well
be
that
this
is
the
business
of
insurance
and
then
lawyers
when
they
represent
liability
--
represent
insureds
under
liability
policies
are
equally
engaged
in
the
business
for
insurer.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
about
the
words
“every
person
engaged
therein”
is
it
your
position
that
those
words
grant
an
exemption
to
the
pharmacies?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
that
mean
that
if
the
pharmacy
hold
a
trade
association
or
similar
meeting
and
say,
“we'd
like
to
increase
by
15%
the
price
of
drugs
on
our
schedule
with
this
blue
shield
policy
is
that
that
meeting
would
be
exempt
and
they
implement
it
by
then
going
around
to
the
insurance
company
and
say,
“we
want
15%
more”,
and
you
renegotiate
the
agreement
with
the
group
as
a
whole
and
come
out
with
a
higher
drug
price,
is
that
exempt
or
is
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
there
are
persons
engaged
in
the
“business
of
insurance”
is
my
question.
you
say
they're
not
persons
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance
so.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
then
the
other
signatories
exempt
in
so
far
as
a
collaborate
with
one
another
in
determining
what
--
how
to
negotiate
with
blue
shield
about
the
price
schedule.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no,
not
the
dispensing
fee.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
dispensing
fee.
i'm
talking
about
the
drug
price,
the
price
schedule.
you
have
a
price
schedule
i
take
it
with
chapters
agreements
on
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry
the
dispensing
is
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no,
the
reason
that's
beside
the
point
is
because
the
exemption
if
it
applies
would
cover
the
conduct
even
if
you
did
have
an
antitrust
violation.
so,
we
have
to
really
consider
whether
or
not
the
exemption
covers
the
illegal
conduct
as
well
as
the
conduct
which
does
not
appear
to
be
legal
on
this.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you
mentioned
would
be
said
in
a
competitive
atmosphere
but
you're
talking
about
competitions
between
blue
shield
and
the
drug
companies
rather
than
competition
among
the
drug
companies.
and
here,
i
gather
some
drug
companies
accepted
your
offer
and
others
turned
it
down.
so
that
some
think
that
maybe
if
they
could
agree
on
a
higher
price
they
might
come
into
the
program.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
purpose
of
the
exemption
is
to
protect
the
competitors
even
if
there
is
no
competition
at
all
even
if
there
is
collaboration.
in
your
point
as
i
understand
it
and
i
think
you're
forth
right
on
it
that
even
if
the
drug
companies
all
--
the
whole
market
got
together
and
agreed
to
try
and
change
the
economic
arrangement
so
that
they'll
get
15%
more
out
of
these
sales
and
they
do
now
that
that
would
be
an
exempt.
and
if
they
ultimately
and
if
blue
shield
ultimately
signed
up
with
them
then
it
would
be
exempt?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
that
blue
shield
within
effect
have
the
power
to
grant
the
exemption
if
it
were
approved
ultimately
approved
by
the
blue
shield.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
it
comes
of
“business
of
insurance”
as
soon
as
blue
shield
signs
the
contract.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
a
business
price
by
the
drug
companies
which
ultimately
blue
shield
could
take
or
leave
but
ultimate
if
it
takes
it
if
i
understand
your
position
as
soon
as
the
insurance
company
signs
up
then
that
has
the
effect
of
conferring
exemption
on
what
would
otherwise
have
been
an
illegal
price
fixing
conspiracy.
that's
your
position,
it's
perfectly
legitimate
position
but
i'm
just
trying
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you're
asking
for
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
if
there
is
a
pure
free
competition
you
don't
need
an
exemption.
well,
you
don't
have
to
come
in
and
ask
for
an
exemption
if
you're
just
talking
about
having
nobody
be
liable
for
competing
with
one
another.
you
don't
need
for
an
exemption
on
that
hypothesis.
you
just
need
it
when
you
have
conduct
which
would
otherwise
violate
the
statute.
otherwise,
there's
no
point
in
this
litigation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
lawsuit
here
too,
i
understand
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
kaiser,
your
time
maybe
running
a
bit
short.
i'm
interested
in
knowing
precisely
what
the
insurance
commission
of
texas
did
with
respect
to
these
agreements.
i
understood
that
initially
it
exempted
them
from
approval
but
thereafter
regarded
their
agreements
are
subject
to
all
other
laws
applicable
to
the
insurance
business
in
texas.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
then
it
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
understood
you
say
initially
that
the
policy
had
been
approved
and
now
you
say
that
it
was
exempted,
and
i
so
understood
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
and
i
have
it
before
me
that
in
september
1969,
the
texas
insurance
commission
of
insurance
issued
another
written
order
exempting
the
policy
from
the
approval
requirement
of
the
texas
code,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
what's
the
current
status,
is
it
approved
or
exempted?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
is
the
more
recent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
an
approval
order?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
all
other
laws
with
respect
to
insurance
remain
applicable
even
with
respect
to
an
exempted
policy.
i
understand
from
what
c-85
said.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
what
does
that
regulation
consists
so
far
as
this
type
of
insurance
then?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
that
the
deposition
on
that
testimony
given
prior
to
the
1974
approval
of
this
policy?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
did
he
reconcile
that
action
of
the
commission
if
indeed
that
commission
did
act
that
way
with
his
testimony?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
i
understood
that
the
policy
call
for
this
agreement
that
we're
talking
about
here
this
pharmacy
agreement.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
wonder
mr.
justice
stewart
is
right
because
section
b
says,
it
will
supersede
any
law
enacted
by
any
state
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
i
don't
think
that
language
covers
state
antitrust
laws,
does
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
the
question
is
to
whether
it
supply
after
the
fact,
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
law
enacted
by
a
state
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
if
the
