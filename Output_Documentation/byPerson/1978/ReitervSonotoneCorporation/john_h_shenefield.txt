mr.
john
h.
shenefield
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
deciding
as
it
did
that
the
consumer
has
insufficient
standing,
that
it
has
not
been
injured
in
its
property.
the
eighth
circuit
at
least
as
to
the
retail
trades
in
this
country,
created
an
antitrust
exemption,
except
for
the
government.
$1.3
trillion
of
commerce,
nearly
50%
of
the
gross
national
product
of
this
country
would
be
removed
from
the
effects
of
private
treble-damage
actions.
and
that
fact
remains
in
spite
of
the
thrust
of
the
legislative
history,
in
spite
of
a
clear
meaning
of
the
language
in
my
view,
in
spite
of
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
many
recently
decided
cases,
and
in
spite
of
the
obvious
policy
purposes
of
the
treble-damage
remedy.
for
commerce
at
the
retail
level,
the
court
of
appeals
simply
deprives
antitrust
enforcement
altogether
of
the
benefit
and
assistance
of
private
policing
and
the
private
attorneys
general.
and
in
so
doing,
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
does
violence
to
the
twin
policy
purposes
that
this
court
has
ascribed
to
private
antitrust
enforcement,
compensation
and
deterrence.
compensation,
because
the
only
victims
of
the
antitrust
violation
at
the
retail
level
are
unable
to
sue.
deterrence,
because
the
violations
and
the
violators
of
the
antitrust
laws
simply
do
not
have
to
be
concerned
about
the
threat
of
private
suits.
indeed,
it
could
be
argued
that
antitrust
violations
would
be
encouraged
by
this
ruling
if
it
were
made
--
if
it
were
generalized
because
a
violator
rather
than
having
to
anticipate
that
he
would
be
deprived
of
the
fruits
of
the
illegality,
in
fact
could
count
on
garnering
storing
up
retentions
of
the
fruits
of
antitrust
violation.
now,
analysis
begins
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
injury
alone
mr.
justice
rehnquist
would
not
be
enough.
that
is
the
standard
under
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
for
anticipatory
injunctive
relief.
but
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
i
believe
that
in
formulating
a
remedy
and
requiring
a
proof
of
standing
in
order
to
achieve
right
of
damages,
there
had
to
have
been
some
kind
of
injury
to
business
or
property,
that
is
injury
to
a
commercial
interest,
not
in
business
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
physical
injury?
injury
to
reputation?
injury
of
a
non-commercial
nature
that
did
not
implicate
the
parties
commercial
interest,
and
we
strongly
believe
that
a
consumer
who
makes
a
purchase
in
the
open
market
has
a
commercial
interest.
mr.
justice
stevens,
you
can
injure
business
in
my
view
without
injuring
property.
you
can
injure
business
by
denying
business
opportunity,
an
exclusive
dealing
arrangement
for
instance
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
might
not
injure
a
plaintiff
in
his
property,
but
could
conceivably
injure
his
business
by
denial
of
business
opportunity.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
you
would
not
have
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
agree.
you
would
not
have
to
prove
it
in
my
view
in
order
to
have
standing
to
sue
against
the
antitrust
violation.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
you
have
to
have
a
foregoing
business
opportunity
that
is
calculable,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
and
i
think
that's
the
essence
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
this
case
and
that's
the
essence
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
chattanooga
case
in
1906,
it's
the
essence
of
the
decision
in
pfizer
with
the
foreign
government
was
not
in
any
business
as
such.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
the
property
interest
is
in
being
overcharged,
having
money
diminished
as
the
result
of
violation
of
antitrust
laws
as
the
court
described
in
the
chattanooga
case.
the
disjunctive
in
my
view
was
put
there
with
the
purpose
to
offer
alternative
grounds
for
plaintiffs
to
reach
the
courthouse
door.
this
plaintiff
reaches
the
courthouse
door
because
she
had
her
property
diminished
as
the
result
of
an
overcharge.
now,
the
legislative
history
i
think,
there
are
bits
and
pieces
of
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
cited.
there
are
bits
and
pieces
of
it
in
both
in
all
of
the
briefs.
i
think
the
fairest
thing
to
be
said
about
the
legislative
history
is
that
many
of
the
legislators
believe
that
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act
were
enacted
to
assist
to
consumers
in
the
fight
as
they
put
it
against
the
monopoly
profits
of
the
trust
of
the
day.
many
of
course
also
were
concerned
about
the
small
business
competitors.
no
one
suggested
in
the
debates
that
consumers
were
ousted,
that
consumers
would
be
unable
to
apply
to
the
court
for
remedy.
the
sole
debate
in
the
legislature
as
nearly
as
anyone
can
tell,
was
about
the
degree
of
effectiveness
of
those
remedies.
whether
or
not
they
went
far
enough,
but
no
one
suggested
that
there
was
not
an
antitrust
consumer
remedy
there.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
mean
--
in
this
case,
an
ultimate
purchaser,
a
direct
purchaser
in
this
case,
illinois
brick
is
non-implicated
in
this
case
because
you
have
a
direct
purchaser.
but
a
consumer
it
seems
to
me
in
common
parlance
most
often
means
direct
purchaser.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct.
it's
not
here
because
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
but
there
is
--
this
plaintiff
was
a
direct
purchaser.
the
rationale
of
illinois
brick
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
they
didn't
discuss
class
actions
obviously,
but
there
is
language
in
the
debates
of
discussing
consumer
actions,
individual
rights,
the
rights
of
individuals
to
recover.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
it
was
not
until
rule
23
and
until
the
class
action
procedure
was
developed.
it
simply
wasn't
an
effective
remedy
for
an
individual
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
for
very
large
consumers,
that
correct.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct.
but
antitrust
in
general
is
regarded
as
having
been
designed
to
promote
consumer
welfare
through
the
protection
of
a
competitive
process.
this
court
described
it
as
better
products
than
lower
prices
in
the
northern
pacific.
it's
simply
cannot
have
been
the
purpose
of
congress
in
formulating
a
treble-damage
remedy.
in
aid
of
consumer
welfare,
to
deny
that
remedy
to
the
very
persons
that
the
laws
were
denied
were
designed
to
protect
in
the
first
place.
in
chattanooga
which
is
controlling
in
this
case,
the
court
held
that
the
city
there
was
a
buyer
of
goods
as
is
reiter
in
this
case.
chattanooga
paid
more
for
those
goods
as
a
result
of
an
antitrust
violation,
as
did
reiter
in
this
case.
chattanooga's
property
was
diminished
as
a
result
of
that
overcharge.
and
so
to
was
reiter's
property
diminished
in
this
case
it
is
alleged.
the
court
held
that
chattanooga
therefore
was
injured
in
its
property
and
could
come
into
court
under
section
4.
does
it
really
make
sense
to
think
of
chattanooga,
a
consumer,
a
city,
that
has
standing
to
come
into
court
entitled
to
recover?
or
even
a
foreign
government
as
a
consumer
entitled
to
recover?
and
not
admit
u.s.
citizens,
american
citizens
to
court
as
consumers
entitled
to
recover?
there
is
nothing
that
rules
that
out
in
the
eighth
circuit
opinion.
indeed,
its
whole
suggestion
is
that
consumers
simply
do
not
have
an
adequate
interest
in
prosecuting
and
suing
antitrust
violations
to
be
permitted
to
come
into
court.
the
legislative
history,
their
language
of
the
statute,
the
words
of
this
court,
and
above
all
the
policy
purposes
of
the
private
treble-damage
remedy
under
the
antitrust
laws
all
argued
strongly
for
permitting
citizens
to
come
into
court
as
consumers.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
would
hate
to
be
examined
on
which
aspects
of
the
congressional
letters
has
made
sense
and
which
did
not.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
no
plaintiffs
here,
if
you
have
a
retail
sale
in
which
there
was
an
antitrust
violation
and
there
is
no
plaintiff
whatsoever,
that
you
come
inevitably
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
simply
could
not
have
intended
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i'm
not,
but
the
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
the
most
recent
congressional
utterance
on
this
subject
specifically
that
we
know
about
is
the
parens
patriae
amendments
in
1976
where
at
least
this
court
found
a
new
procedural
device
for
achieving
old
and
existing
substantive
rights
was
being
created.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
philosophical
difference,
in
my
view,
there's
a
clear
legal
difference
because
of
the
statute
and
the
scheme
of
enforcement
of
antitrust
laws,
where
the
private
remedy
was
designed
to
promote
enforcement,
to
supplement
enforcement,
where
it
was
more
than
simply
a
compensatory
device,
where
the
deterrent
effect
of
enforcement
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
don't
think
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
proposed
amendment,
but
i
don't
think
that
amendment
could
have
been
in
the
context
of
antitrust
laws.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct.
but
the
parens
patriae
legislation
assumed
that
there
did
exist
a
substantive
right
of
recovery
for
consumers,
and
the
parens
patriae
legislation
--
if
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
is
affirmed
and
it's
generalized,
the
parens
patriae
legislation
is
entirely
vitiated
because
there
will
be
no
consumer
right
of
recovery.
thank
you
very
much.
