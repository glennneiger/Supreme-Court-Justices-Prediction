the
illinois
brick
issue
was
not
here,
is
it?
justice

there's
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
its
applicability
as
you
know.
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
here
is
not
an
illinois
brick
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
large
purchasers?
justice
potter
stewart
municipalities
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
foreign
governments?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
wilheim,
is
the
thrust
of
your
argument
then
that
if
this
were
a
price
fixing
case
that
plaintiff
would
have
standing?
justice
potter
stewart
then,
what's
the
point
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
merits
of
the
case
aren't
before
us
at
all
here
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well
generally,
it
doesn't
mean
retail
purchasers
in
common
parlance
today?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
it?
what
is
the
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
any
purchasers
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
every
purchasers
are
consumer,
either
for
his
own
use
or
in
the
--
for
use
of
the
purchase
product
in
the
manufacturer
of
other
products
or
whatever,
he
consumes
it,
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
whether
it's
a
bar
of
soap
or
thousand
tons
of
steel.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case,
hawaii
was
not
suing
as
a
purchaser,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
point.
that's
not
what
was
dealt
with
in
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
and
through
its
citizenry
generally.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
a
state
and
almost
by
definition
of
the
state.
the
state
for
example
doesn't
by
a
pair
of
shoes
to
wear.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
buys
shoes,
it
buys
it
in
its
commercial
capacity
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
its
people
in
prisons
or
whatever.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
they
never
buy
a
dress
to
wear.
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
his
business,
it
wasn't
his
principal
business
maybe.
justice
potter
stewart
your
answer
may
have
been
too
fast,
i
mean
i
don't
know
about
the
king
ranch,
but
i
suppose
they're
in
the
cow
business,
aren't
they?
