mr.
warren
spannaus
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
states
are
interested
in
this
case
because
of
the
state's
increasing
role
in
antitrust
law
enforcement.
the
language
of
section
4,
the
legislative
history,
and
the
overwhelming
way
to
the
case
law
supports
non-business
consumers
standing.
but
even
more
importantly,
the
existence
of
non-business
consumers
standing
is
important
in
the
overall
scheme
of
antitrust
law
enforcement.
threat
of
treble-damages
is
a
strong.
indeed,
the
strongest
threat
against
antitrust
violations.
denial
of
standing
the
private
purchasers
would
certainly
reduce
the
number
of
treble-damage
actions.
this
would
defeat
the
two
major
purposes
of
section
4
to
deter
violators
and
deprived
them
of
the
right
of
real
---
to
keep
their
illegal
profits
and
two,
to
compensate
victims
for
their
injuries.
this
would
of
course
the
states
recognized
the
importance
of
non-business
consumer
standings.
criminal
prosecutions
and
government
civil
actions
certainly
are
not
sufficient
deterrent.
public
agencies
do
not
have
the
ability
to
bring
every
possible
action.
the
justice
department
can
only
bring
about
60
to
a
100
cases
a
year,
and
states
are
severely
and
similarly
restricted.
excuse
me.
the
lower
court
exhibited
a
strong
disliked
towards
private
consumer
actions
saying
that
they
were
either
coercive
by
nature
or
many
time
non-meritorious.
the
states
disagree
with
this
and
the
congress
has
disagreed.
affirmance
of
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
would
eliminate
all
nine
business
consumer
actions.
certainly,
there
are
many
cases
when
private
parties
can
bring
a
lawsuit
on
their
own
and
there
are
certainly
many
cases
when
the
class
would
be
small
enough
to
be
manageable.
for
example,
a
conspiracy
to
fix
real
estate
prices
on
residential
homes
and
a
particular
area
could
give
a
small
group
of
individuals
enough
economic
incentive
to
bring
an
action
on
their
own,
or
an
individual
who
purchase
a
large
quantity
of
goods
over
a
--
or
a
large
quantity
of
a
single
item
over
long
period
of
time.
for
example,
a
life
maintenance
drug
might
have
the
incentive
to
bring
an
action
on
his
own
individually.
the
remedy
for
a
non-manageable
class
is
a
refusal
to
certify
the
classes
and
a
remedy
and
the
remedy
for
a
non-meritorious
action
is
either
dismissal
or
summary
judgment.
next,
we
would
like
to
discuss
the
parens
issue
that
was
raised
here
a
few
minutes
ago.
ideally,
the
parens
patriae
authority
should
not
be
an
issue
in
this
case.
however,
we
would
hope
that
this
court
would
not
rely
on
the
parens
issue
as
to
the
eighth
circuit
to
deny
private
rights.
the
parens
issue
was
not
meant
to
be
a
substitute
for
all
private
actions,
it
was
meant
to
be
a
supplement
and
not
a
replacement.
making
parens
exclusive
remedy
would
certainly
--
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
when
they
pass
the
antitrust
improvement
act
of
1976.
mr.
warren
spannaus
yes,
sir,
parens
patriae,
excuse
me
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
warren
spannaus
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
certainly
could
be
--
we
would
have
some
very
difficult
problems
under
footnote
14
of
the
illinois
brick
case.
although,
we
would
still
argue
the
attorneys
general
and
the
state
would
still
argue
that
we
had
a
substantive
remedy
created
by
the
act.
mr.
warren
spannaus
we
would
argue
that
weight.
but
the
reason
that
we
feel
that
this
--
that
private
actions
are
important
is
because
first
of
all,
the
states
don't
have
the
resources
and
the
ability
to
bring
all
the
possible
meritorious
actions
that
may
exists.
and
secondly,
it
could
make
the
whole
situation
become
very
political
if
the
attorney
general
had
to
bring
every
conceivable
action
in
the
state,
he
might
then
be
forced
to
bring
some
actions
you
wouldn't
normally
bring
because
he
felt
that
without
merit,
and
it
bring
a
merely
to
make
sure
that
he
wasn't
criticize
at
some
future
date
for
not
bringing
the
action.
and
so
the
other
provision
that
--
excuse
me,
that
congress
granted
was
the
opt
out
provision
in
the
bill
itself.
congress
said
that
individuals
who
didn't
feel
they
wanted
to
participate
in
the
action
of
the
attorney
general
and
wanted
to
retain
their
own
private
right
to
sue
could
opt
out
of
any
specific
action
that
their
attorney
general
might
bring.
and
congress
also
provided
for
an
opt
out
provision
by
the
entire
state.
upon
action
of
the
legislature,
the
attorney
general
can
be
prohibited
from
bringing
any
action
whatsoever,
and
you
could
find
the
very
serious
and
difficult
position
that
a
consumer
in
one
state
would
have
a
remedy
because
his
legislature
did
not
opt
out,
and
a
situation
in
other
state
where
his
state
did
have
an
opt
--
did
opt
out
and
he
have
no
recourse
under
the
federal
law.
and
so,
it's
clear
i
think
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
did
not
intend
the
attorneys
generals
to
be
the
exclusive
parties
in
this
matters,
and
that
private
rights
were
intended
to
remain
because
of
the
two
opt
out
provisions.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
it's
--
the
attorneys
general
don't
have
the
resources
to
bring
all
the
potential
actions
in
their
state.
finally,
this
court
has
expressed
concern
with
the
complexity
of
the
treble-damage
actions
and
stated
recently
that
the
already
protracted
treble-damage
proceedings
should
be
kept
as
simple
as
possible.
the
states
would
like
to
suggest
that
this
would
--
affirmance
of
the
eighth
circuit
would
merely
make
it
more
complex
situation
because
in
entirely
new
line
of
thinking
would
have
to
be
device
new
body
allotted
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
a
business
or
a
personal
purchase,
and
whether
or
not
the
business
purchase
was
used
as
intended
for
genuinely
business
purpose.
so,
we
would
like
to
--
we
would
respectfully
hope
that
this
court
would
reverse
the
eighth
circuit,
that
the
affirmance
of
the
eighth
circuit
would
frustrate
the
underlying
principles
of
the
antitrust
laws,
that
would
permit
a
price
fixer
to
keep
his
ill-gotten
gains
and
deprive
the
victim
of
his
most
effective
remedy
and
have
no
means
to
be
compensated,
and
it
would
eliminate
a
major
deterrent
to
treble-damage
actions,
and
so
we
would
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
eighth
circuit
and
reaffirm
the
existence
of
non-business
consumer
standing.
mr.
warren
spannaus
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
--
mr.
warren
spannaus
i
think
that
it's
clear
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
has
always
felt
that
this
--
that
consumers
did
have
the
right
to
bring
this
actions.
however,
if
the
eighth
circuit
were
affirmed,
there
would
be
a
lot
of
immediate
activity
to
have
this
corrected,
but
i
feel
that
that
would
certainly
be
unnecessary
and
in
all
due
respect,
sometime
very
time-consuming
because
congress
does
not
always
act
as
swiftly
as
one
might
hold.
mr.
warren
spannaus
no
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
not.
however,
i
think
that
congress
has
already
acted
and
through
the
reading
of
the
language
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
sherman
act
as
we've
talked
about
here
earlier,
and
also
the
discussions
that
were
back
in
1973,
1974,
and
1975
when
the
antitrust
to
prove
an
action
to
pass
it,
congress
already
assumed
that
the
consumer
had
--
the
consumer
had
this
right,
and
consequently,
they
felt
that
there
was
a
necessary
to
make
it
any
more
clear.
and
i
think
that
the
courts
if
i
may
say,
the
eighth
circuit
has
gone
beyond
what
the
congress
intended
and
they
are
the
once
who
have
acted
in
the
policy
and
the
legislative
way
rather
than
this
court
doing
the
same
thing
if
they
reverse
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
warren
spannaus
yes
mr.
--
mr.
warren
spannaus
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
only
state
who
was
not
participating
is
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
warren
spannaus
no,
it's
not.
it's
--
the
attorney
general
of
georgia,
mr.
arthur
bolton
has
not
participated
in
the
antitrust
improvement
act
of
1976
in
using
in
any
of
the
funds,
and
so
he
is
also
decided
not
to
participate
in
the
amici.
mr.
warren
spannaus
he
is
a
fre
--
mr.
warren
spannaus
that
--
mr.
warren
spannaus
mr.
justice
stevens,
that's
probably
the
reason
he
figures
he
can
do
it
on
his
own.
but
the
other
49
states
have.
thank
you
very
much
for
allowing
as
to
participate.
