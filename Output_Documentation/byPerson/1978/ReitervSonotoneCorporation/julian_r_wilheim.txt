mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
julian
r.
wilheim,
and
i
am
one
of
the
attorneys
who
will
argue
today
for
the
respondents,
the
other
one
being
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
try
to
devote
my
time
primarily
to
the
background
of
the
legislation
involved
in
this
case
and
the
legislative
history
that
goes
to
the
question
here
which
is
a
very
narrow
one.
accordingly,
i
will
use
15
minutes
or
less
in
the
process.
i
would
like
initially
to
put
into
perspective
what
i
haven't
heard
yet
this
morning.
this
is
a
case
involving
a
very
narrow
issue.
it
purports
to
be
a
class
action
but
as
yet,
there
has
been
no
certification
of
the
class.
so,
we
are
talking
essentially
about
a
plaintiff
named
mrs.
reiter.
the
complaint
in
the
case
and
the
pleadings
are
in
the
appendix
before
the
court
speaks
on
occasion
as
if
there
had
been
price
fixing
by
these
respondents,
as
if
there
had
been
a
retail
price
maintenance
program.
while
it
is
true
that
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
essentially
is
what
this
motion
was
that
raise
for
standing
issue,
the
facts
that
are
well
pleaded
are
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
the
motion.
the
motion
did
not
admit
either
legal
conclusion
or
facts
that
do
not
exist.
this
is
not
a
price
fixing
case,
and
the
reason
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
is
that
in
the
opposing
briefs,
there
is
a
concerted
effort
to
post
the
case
as
a
price
fixing
case.
and
therefore,
they
indicate
as
if
the
respondents
were
doing
something
that
is
per
se
bad
under
the
antitrust
laws.
we
have
noted
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
in
our
position
that
with
respect
to
beltone
electronics
corporation
which
happens
to
be
my
client.
we
have
been
in
a
very
long
section
5
ftc
case
in
which
the
administrative
law
judge
has
found
flatly
that
beltone
does
not
fix
prices.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
no,
sir.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
the
point
is
i
do
not
want
this
court
to
have
a
psychological
view
that
these
are
these
bad
things
call
price
fixers
as
distinguished
from
other
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
which
for
example
would
come
under
the
sylvania
case
under
the
rule
of
reason.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
no,
the
merits
are
not
before
you
know,
should
they
be
at
this
moment.
but
on
the
other
hand,
candid
of
the
court
should
require
the
petitioners
to
point
out
not
again
and
again
and
again
and
again
as
they
do
in
their
briefs
that
these
are
price
fixers.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
true
justice
stevens,
but
what
all
i
am
saying
at
this
point,
--
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
--
is
that
i
don't
want
the
court
to
get
the
impression
that
they
are
dealing
with
these
bad
fellows
called
price
fixers.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
which
is
not
based
on
price
fixing,
it's
based
on
--
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
inferentially,
i
presume
that
if
you
go
to
the
white
world
that
is
true.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
now,
we're
dealing
with
the
statute
that
is
now
90
years
old.
judge
larson
in
the
reiter
decision
at
the
outside
--
at
the
outset
of
this
case
denying
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
standing
very
amply
pointed
out
at
page
937
of
his
opinion
that
nobody
knows
what
the
word
consumers
meant
when
the
sherman
act
was
on
the
consideration.
nobody
knows
what
congress
was
thinking
about
at
the
time
with
regard
to
retail
consumers
except
if
you
read
the
history.
you
find
that
there
was
great
concern
in
the
congress,
that
they
would
be
interfering
with
state's
rights
and
state's
jurisdiction
if
they
dealt
with
the
kind
of
retail
consumer
that
we
have
today
in
our
society.
in
the
context
of
the
society
at
the
time,
we
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
first
100
years
of
the
republic.
there
had
been
a
depression
in
the
70's,
there
had
been
a
depression
in
the
80's,
and
there
had
come
along
in
our
economic
society,
this
then
new
thing
which
we
called
trusts.
there
were
corporations
and
corporations
where
to
some
degree
regulated
by
the
states,
but
there
where
these
trusts
which
were
completely
unregulated.
and
there
was
this
squabble
going
on
between
the
democratic
party
and
the
republican
party
at
the
time
over
protective
terrors,
and
people
were
clamoring
for
some
halter
on
the
trusts
as
they
were
called
at
the
time.
president
grover
cleveland
made
a
speech
to
the
congress
in
his
third
message
on
the
state
of
the
union
that
something
had
to
be
done
about
the
trusts.
and
in
1888,
senator
sherman
in
the
50th
congress
introduced
resolutions
to
the
effect
that
something
had
to
be
done
about
the
trusts.
we
finally
get
to
the
53rd
congress
where
we
had
his
bill,
senate
bill
1,
which
was
the
forerunner
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act.
and
if
you
read
this
legislative
history
carefully,
the
bill
was
finally
sent
to
the
senate
judiciary
committee
and
it
came
out
in
a
relatively
few
days
with
nothing
left
except
its
title,
s1
and
senator
sherman's
name
absolutely
obliterated
everything
he
had
in
his
bills
except
his
name
and
the
title.
the
bill
came
out
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee,
and
for
the
first
time,
we
had
this
phrase
that
we're
worrying
with
here
today
called
business
or
property.
what
does
it
mean?
the
various
members
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
talked
about
the
small
businessman,
the
small
mechanic
who
is
in
business.
he
talked
about
small
farmers,
and
you
can
find
in
there
references
to
problems
such
as
the
one
i
remember
most
specifically,
if
a
small
tobacco
farmer
had
to
go
to
the
“trust”
to
buy
baling
cotton
to
bale
his
tobacco
and
he
was
overcharged,
this
was
the
kind
of
commercial
enterprise
we
were
talking
about.
nowhere
do
we
find
any
definition
of
property
such
as
we
try
to
find
in
the
dictionary,
the
webster's
international
on
the
bridged,
black's
law
dictionary,
i
went
back
to
bouvier's
law
dictionary
of
my
law
school
days
of
many
years
ago,
nothing
that
will
give
us
a
guideline.
all
that
you
can
sense
out
of
this
total
legislative
history
on
the
sherman
act
was
they
were
talking
about
business
or
property
in
the
total
commercial
sense
of
property
involved
in
business.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
they
did.
there
was
reference
to
a
class
action.
there
was
even
reference
to
setting
up
a
dual
jurisdiction
between
the
federal
and
the
state
courts
for
class
action,
and
then
congress
turned
tail
and
said
forget
it,
because
we're
worried.
we
think
our
only
basis
for
enacting
this
kind
of
antitrust
legislation
is
the
commerce
clause.
now,
we
hear
90
days
later
--
90
years
later
about
the
consumer,
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
is
correct.
the
answer
relies
not
in
this
court,
it's
a
different
society.
it's
a
different
world.
it's
a
different
economic
picture.
if
the
consumer
needs
a
protection
that
we're
trying
to
engraft
on
this
ancient
statute,
this
unequated
statute
in
that
sense,
the
remedy
lies
in
the
congress.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
yes,
they
did.
yes
they
did
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but,
we're
talking
about
a
retail
consumer
for
personal
use
of
articles
of
where
if
you
will.
in
this
case
--
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
i
think
in
many
instances,
nobody
has
found
out
what
we're
talking
about.
the
cases
are
there
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
the
word
consumer
as
we
know
it
today
has
never
been
defined.
in
one
of
the
briefs
and
i
think
it's
the
government
brief
for
example,
there's
a
citation
to
the
text
written
by
areeda
and
turner,
and
i
checked
it
out
and
i'm
amazed
to
find
that
in
that
reference,
these
office
have
a
heading
in
black
letters
called
consumers
and
non-commercial
plaintiffs.
i
really
would
like
to
know
what
he's
talking
about
because
when
you
read
the
next
half
a
dozen
pages,
it
says
unclear
as
a
mist.
but
why
did
he,
this
notable
text
writing
used
the
word
consumers
and
non-commercial
plaintiffs?
he
must
have
had
something
in
mind.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
consumers
and
non-commercial
plaintiffs.
are
they
two
different
kinds
of
people,
or
is
it
one?
if
consumers
meant
in
1890
what
i
think
it
matters
from
reading
the
extensive
legislative
history,
then
non-commercial
plaintiffs
used
today
or
mrs.
reiter,
and
while
she
is
a
consumer
in
our
modern
society
obviously,
she
was
not
that
consumer
about
which
the
congress
was
talking
in
1890.
when
we
turn
to
the
1914
clayton
act
legislative
history,
there
is
no
help
to
be
found.
they
simply
reiterated
what
was
section
7
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
i've
heard
some
talks
here
today
about
parens
patriae
and
about
direct
purchasers.
this
plaintiff
was
not
based
on
the
pleadings
and
could
not
have
been
a
direct
purchaser.
she
bought
from
a
retail
hearing
aid
dealer,
she
did
not
buy
from
these
manufactures,
and
i
don't
know
where
illinois
brick
is
coming
into
the
picture
if
and
when
we
ever
go
back
to
the
lower
court.
with
regard
to
parens
patriae,
i
went
through
the
legislative
history
of
the
1976
statute
very
carefully
because
in
the
government's
brief,
they
say
it's
a
procedural
device.
they
point
to
footnote
14
in
the
illinois
brick
case.
in
the
state's
brief,
we
find
that
the
states
are
saying
it
created
a
new
cause
of
action,
a
substantive
right.
and
if
by
chance
you
have
to
interpret
the
1976
parens
patriae
provisions,
they
would
prefer
to
have
it
treated
as
a
substantive
provision.
well,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1976
act
is
quite
something
to
read.
a
bill
--
there
were
three
bills
in
the
house,
there
was
one
bill
in
the
senate,
the
bills
went
back
and
forth,
there
came
a
time
when
they
were
worried
about
losing
the
bill
because
of
a
filibuster
by
senator
allen
of
alabama
at
the
end
of
that
particular
session.
there
was
never
a
conference.
there
was
a
legislative
name
such
as
i
have
never
read
in
my
lifetime
where
a
motion
was
made
by
senator
byrd,
then
the
majority
whipped.
senator
philip
hart
handled
it,
and
the
upshot
was
two
sections
which
were
not
concerned
with
here,
the
first
two
sections
of
that
act
where
the
house's
version.
the
third
section
which
is
parens
patriae
was
the
version
of
the
senate.
it
was
the
senate's
bill.
and
if
you
read
what
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
said,
senator
hart
and
his
analysis
of
the
bill
as
they
it,
he
says
very
specifically,
we
created
a
new
cause
of
action.
in
that
respect
with
due
deference
to
the
court,
footnote
14
in
the
illinois
brick
case
which
says
it's
a
procedural
device
and
which
says
only
the
house
report
on
the
bill
is
just
plain
incorrect
because
senator
hart's
remarks
has
sponsored
the
bill
of
the
intention,
the
intention
to
create
“a
new
cause
of
action.”
and
the
senate
report,
are
to
the
contrary,
and
i
would
say
they
governed
it.
and
so,
you
have
a
new
cause
of
action
and
i
do
not
believe
that
an
adverse
rulings
such
as
that
of
the
eighth
circuit
will
obviate
the
parens
patriae
provision
or
take
the
heart
out
of
it.
i
think
that
is
all
that
needs
to
be
said
on
the
legislative
history,
and
that
i
can
sit
down.
mr.
julian
r.
wilheim
thank
you,
sir.
