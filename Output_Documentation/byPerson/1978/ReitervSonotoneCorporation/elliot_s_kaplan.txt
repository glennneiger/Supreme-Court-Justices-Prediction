mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
wilheim
has
stated
for
you
in
some
reform
the
legislative
history
which
unequivocally
demonstrates
that
a
consumer
who
purchases
for
non-commercial
purposes
does
not
have
standing
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
i
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
dwell
on
the
term
consumer.
that
term
has
been
used
throughout
the
briefs
and
throughout
the
morning's
argument.
anyone
who
makes
a
purchase,
who
consumes
goods,
is
a
consumer.
general
motors
is
a
consumer.
my
client
textron
is
a
consumer.
mrs.
reiter
is
also
a
consumer.
the
courts
and
the
congress
never
talked
about
consumers
who
purchase
for
non-business
or
commercial
purposes.
today
in
our
present
day
society,
the
word
consumer
is
taken
on
some
new
meaning.
when
we
talked
about
consumer,
we
think
of
the
myriad
people
out
there,
the
masses
of
people.
the
congress
in
1890
and
the
courts
prior
to
the
judge
larson
didn't
think
of
consumer
as
that
group
of
people.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
maybe,
your
honor.
however,
that
is
not
necessary
the
definition
of
the
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
consumer
is
anyone
who
buys
and
consumes
goods
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that's
correct.
presumably
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
certainly
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
is
right.
however,
the
congress
and
the
courts
have
limited
the
term
consumer
throughout
the
debates
in
the
congress
into
interpretation.
and
i
direct
this
court's
attention
to
its
opinion,
the
opinion
that
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
case
of
hawaii
versus
standard
oil.
the
case
has
not
yet
been
mentioned
this
morning,
which
we
suggest
is
controlling
in
the
case
--
in
this
case.
as
the
court
may
recall,
the
issue
in
hawaii
was
whether
or
not
hawaii
could
maintain
an
action
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
was
not
rather
could
maintain
action
on
behalf
of
its
citizens,
but
rather
whether
the
injury
was
compensable
under
section
4.
the
critical
question
was
whether
the
injury
asserted
by
hawaii
in
its
parens
patriae
account
is
an
injury
to
its
business
or
property.
that
was
the
critical
question
that
this
court
addressed
in
hawaii
v.
standard
oil.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
it
was,
but
that
was
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that's
right.
it
was
suing
its
parens
patriae
capacity
for
injuries
the
general
economy
of
hawaii.
and
that
was
the
issue
(voice
overlap)
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
and
this
court
as
a
threshold
question
had
to
determine,
what
is
business
or
property
is
an
injury
to
the
general
economy
of
the
state
of
hawaii,
an
injury
to
business
or
property.
this
court
to
mr.
justice
marshall
said
like
the
courts
--
like
the
lower
courts
that
it
consider
the
meaning
of
the
words
business
or
property,
we
conclude
that
they
refer
to
commercial
interest
or
enterprises.
states
can
only
sue
when
they
seek
damages
for
injuries
to
its
their
commercial
interest.
it
couldn't
be
more
clearly,
and
as
articulated
by
mr.
justice
marshall
in
hawaii
v.
standard
oil.
there
are
many
other
lower
courts
decisions.
they've
also
filed
the
same
language.
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
air
pollution
case
is
an
accord
with
the
decision
in
hawaii
versus
standard
oil.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
however,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
the
states
always
has
standards
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that's
correct.
the
states
are
always
buying
in
a
business
or
commercial
sense
when
they
are
buying
in
their
proprietary
capacity.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
they
may
buy
a
dress
for
nurses
who
work
for
a
state
hospital.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
now,
mr.
thomas
point
out
that
judge
williams
in
the
famous
california
trilogy
of
case
was
concerned
about
this.
the
dress
it's
worn
by
the
nurse
and
the
one
the
she
wears
to
a
party
in
the
evening.
that
may
be
a
problem,
but
that
can
be
handled
very
easily.
all
that
need
be
done
is
when
a
plaintiff
brings
on
action,
it
pleads
that
the
purpose
was
for
business
or
commercial
use.
if
the
congress
believes
that
that
is
the
wrong
result,
the
congress
can
change
that.
that
is
a
problem
of
congress
is
making,
none
of
our
making.
it
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
mrs.
reiter
had
alleged
that
she
purchased
the
hearing
aid
in
order
to
carry
out
her
profession
or
her
chosen
occupation,
she
would
be
buying
it
as
a
tool
for
her
business
or
profession,
which
would
then
be
protected
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
she
would
then
have
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
under
section
4.
if
she
did
not
make
that
allegation,
she
would
not
have
standing
under
section
4.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
is
not
the
distinct.
it
is
a
person
who
is
purchasing
or
strictly
personal
use.
if
mrs.
reiter
has
just
decided
that
she
is
going
to
wear
a
hearing
aid
just
because
she
wants
to
hear
the
television
a
bit
better
and
she
may
have
been
overcharged
with
that
--
of
overcharged,
she
doesn't
have
standing.
that
was
not
the
intent
of
section
4.
there
has
been
discussion
by
our
worthy
opposition
this
morning
that
how
can
we
allow
a
foreign
government
to
sue
but
yet,
we
can't
allow
consumers
of
this
country?
that's
a
very
interesting
question.
and
obviously,
this
court
was
not
unanimous
in
deciding
that
a
foreign
government
had
standing.
however,
mr.
justice
stewart
in
writing
the
majority
opinion
in
the
pfizer
case
said
expressly
that
there
was
no
legislative
history
that
he
could
find.
and
therefore,
he
looked
to
other
areas
of
the
law
and
found
that
foreign
governments
have
traditionally
been
held
to
be
persons
who
could
sue
in
the
courts
in
united
states.
in
the
instant
case,
we
have
a
clear
mandate
from
the
congress,
and
that
mandate
has
been
revealed
to
you
this
morning
by
mr.
wilheim.
the
court
in
illinois
brick
recognized
that
not
every
person
injured
by
the
antitrust
laws
is
going
to
have
a
remedy.
the
court
said
in
the
illinois
brick
decision,
if
i
can
find
it,
not
every
injury
traceable
to
antitrust
violation
is
cognizable
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
this
court
further
limited
the
right
to
bring
treble-damage
actions
to
those
persons
who
purchased
directly
from
alleged
violators
and
refuse
to
permit
indirect
purchasers
to
demonstrate
a
pass
on
the
allege
price
overcharges.
this
court
therefore
expressly
acknowledged
that
the
decision
were
deniably
recovery
to
some
who
may
had
been
injured
by
antitrust
violations
by
recognized
the
practical
limits
upon
the
sanction
on
a
private
right
of
action.
the
court
was
mindful
that
there
are
people
who
will
be
injured.
just
as
we
suggest,
mrs.
reiter
might
be
injured
by
alleged
overcharged
that
came
about
because
with
antitrust
violation,
but
there
are
many
others
who
will
have
standing
to
bring
the
action
that
will
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
antitrust
violators.
i
might
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
respondents
are
in
no
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
is
no
question.
but
that
antitrust
laws
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
in
response
to
the
question
(voice
overlap)
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
concern
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
to
protect
the
consumer
welfare.
that
is
a
term
that
is
used
throughout
the
briefs.
professor
bork
has
been
cited
on
many
occasions
--
let
me
explain
that
term.
when
we're
talking
about
consumer
welfare,
the
congress
and
the
courts
had
not
been
talking
about
compensating
a
consumer.
we
are
talking
about
permitting
the
consumer
to
purchase
goods
in
a
free
and
open
competitive
society.
that
is
the
ultimate
test
that
every
court
must
apply
in
determining
whether
or
not,
there
has
been
a
substantive
violation
to
antitrust
laws.
whether
or
not
the
action
will
permit
the
consumer
to
buy
in
that
open
competitive
society,
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
consumer
can
be
compensated.
and
that
is
an
important
distinction
that
we
have
today,
the
distinction
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
you
are
protected
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
let
me
tell
you
how
well
(voice
overlap)
let
me
tell
you
how
well
of
you
are.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
there
are
several
ways
that
you
are
going
to
be
protected.
number
one
in
1976,
the
congress
permitted
your
attorney
to
collect
attorney's
fees
if
he
brings
an
act
of
injunction.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
you
have
to
go
to
an
attorney
sir
and
if
he
collects
for
you
in
the
injunction
action,
he
will
now
be
entitled
to
cover
(voice
overlap);
that's
right.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
she
will
get
an
injunction
stopping
this
practice
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
the
other
remedies
mr.
justice
stevens
are
that
the
parens
patriae
action
is
available
to
her.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
well
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
let
me
just
address
that
question
if
i
may
mr.
justice
stevens.
let's
talk
about
mrs.
reiter
and
going
to
that
corner
lawyer
because
i
think
that
may
be
the
very
cornerstone
of
this
case.
mrs.
reiter
has
a
minuscule
claim.
if
she
is
been
over
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
minuscule
in
terms
of
total
dollars
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
mrs.
reiter
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
it
may
have
a
direct
impact
upon
her
economic
situation.
there's
no
question
about
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
it
is
a
minuscule
claim
in
terms
of
the
size
of
claims
that
the
federal
courts
have
traditionally
heard.
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
talked
about
the
toothpaste
amendment
earlier,
she
has
a
relatively
small
claim
in
terms
of
the
size
of
most
claims
are
filed.
she
has
undertaken
a
very
complex
piece
of
litigation.
as
mr.
wilheim
pointed
out,
this
is
not
a
simple
price
fixing
case
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
simple
price
fixing
case.
this
case
alleges
a
whole
garden
variety
of
vertical
restrictions
imposed
upon
dealers
who
then
resold
the
good
to
mrs.
reiter.
this
is
a
complex
case.
who
has
the
real
interest
in
this
case?
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
it's
not
mrs.
reiter.
it
is
not
the
consumers
because
they
can
be
protected.
it
is
rather
the
plaintiff's
bar
that
has
the
real
and
direct
interest
in
this
litigation.
it
is
they
who
are
concerned
about
what's
going
to
happen
in
this
case.
they
are
not
concerned
with
the
burden
that's
going
to
be
placed
upon
the
administration
of
justice
and
upon
the
courts
of
this
county.
by
having
minuscule
claims
of
consumers
imposed
upon
it.
bur
for
rule
23,
mrs.
reiter
wouldn't
be
here.
she
would
not
assert
her
claim.
it's
interesting
that
judge
larson
said
that
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stevens
and
i
believe
that
we
have
to
look
at
what
is
the
intent
and
the
object
of
the
antitrust
laws,
is
it
just
the
compensating
people,
or
is
it
to
deter
antitrust
violations?
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
the
parens
patriae
action,
the
thread
of
government
action
both
in
united
states
and
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
don't
have
the
number.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
i
don't
know.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
it
certainly
is
a
one
of
a
kind
item.
i'm
not
sure
that
is
valid
distinction
with
one
should
be
recoverable
and
the
other
not.
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
respondents
are
not
arguing
before
a
congressional
body
today.
we're
not
saying
who
should
or
who
should
not
recover.
we
are
simply
saying
let
us
look
at
the
congressional
history.
let
us
look
at
the
cases.
let
us
see
what
has
happened.
that
is
the
result.
if
it
is
an
unpopular
result,
that
is
one
of
congresses
making,
that
is
for
congress
to
correct,
not
for
the
court
to
say
is
what
the
law
intended
in
1890.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
the
opposition
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
certainly
relied
upon
chattanooga
as
a
controlling
case.
chattanooga
was
a
case
that
involved
statute
limitations.
that
was
the
issue
in
chattanooga.
it
involved
the
city
of
atlanta
purchasing
pipe
for
its
city
sewer
and
water
operation.
it
bought
in
a
proprietary
capacity.
the
issue
of
a
non-commercial
or
non-business
consumer
was
not
before
the
court
on
mr.
justice
holmes
wrote
that
opinion.
the
issue
is
not
there.
that
case
is
a
very
narrow
case
and
it
speaks
only
to
the
question
the
statute
limitations
and
there
happens
to
be
some
discussion
about
the
fact
that
the
city
of
atlanta
was
injured
in
its
business
or
property
because
it
overpaid,
and
the
worth
of
the
property
was
overpriced
because
of
the
alleged
price
fixing
conspiracy.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
no
because
in
that
case,
you
did
not
have
the
non-consumer
purchaser.
you
had
a
state
acting
in
a
business
or
proprietary
capacity,
which
is
exactly
what
we
say.
the
result
should
be
in
that
case,
and
that
is
what
the
court
set
follow
consistently
since
chattanooga.
the
issue
of
a
non-consumer
--
excuse
me,
a
non-business
consumer
was
not
before
the
court
in
chattanooga.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
no.
it
must
be
an
injury
to
your
business
or
to
your
property.
the
court
might
ask
me
why
use
both
words
if
we're
talking
about
a
business.
and
i
think
that
is
a
very
valid
question.
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
waldron
decision
in
saying
in
our
brief,
mr.
waldron
was
an
individual
who
was
involved
as
kind
of
an
investment
of
buying
and
selling
oil.
it
was
not
his
business.
and
because
of
some
price
fixing
in
the
oil
industry,
he
was
injured
in
this
investment.
it
covered
his
property,
a
commercial
property.
so
what
the
congress
it
simply
said
injury
in
your
business,
mr.
waldron
would
not
have
had
standing
to
recover
damages
under
section
4.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
it
was
strictly
an
investment
just
as,
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
or
i
bought
a
stock,
it
would
not
be
our
business
or
even
an
ancillary
business
of
buying
stocks,
it's
an
investment
it
strictly
something
that
we
do.
and
it's
a
commercial
property
right
that
we
would
have.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
and
the
property
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
well,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
divorce
the
property
aspect
mr.
justice
stevens
from
the
decision.
you
must
look
at
the
entire
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
i
don't
believe
mr.
justice
stevens
that
he
defined
the
term
property
in
that
decision.
and
the
only
property
involved
in
that
case
if
we're
talking
about
the
property
was
a
commercial
property.
that
was
the
property
in
that
case.
if
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
pay
more
money
than
something
was
worth
because
the
price
fixing
conspiracy
that
congress
could
have
eliminated
the
words
business
or
property.
why
are
they
are
there?
they
are
there
for
specific
reason
because
if
the
congress
wasn't
concern
about
commercial
interest,
it
could
have
done
with
section
4
exactly
what
it
did
was
section
16.
the
congress
knew
how
to
do
it
when
they
want
to
provide
a
remedy
to
everyone,
and
they
did
it
in
section
16.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
fact
that
current
taking
today
in
the
minds
of
the
american
public
might
dictate
a
congressional
result
different
from
that
was
the
congress
reached
in
1890
and
again
in
1914
does
not
provide
a
justification
for
this
court
to
legislate.
if
a
new
remedy
is
needed,
then
the
congress
should
provide
for
it.
and
again,
this
was
the
approach
taken
by
this
court
just
a
year
ago
in
the
famous
illinois
brick
decision.
this
court
recognized
that
indirect
purchasers
may
be
injured
as
much
or
more
than
direct
purchasers.
but
nevertheless,
the
massive
litigation
in
administrative
burden
on
the
courts
caused
this
court
to
conclude
that
treble-damage
actions
should
be
limited
to
direct
purchasers.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
yes,
there
are.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
there
are
certainly
where
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
the
court
recognized
that
not
everybody
is
going
to
have
a
remedy
for
compensation,
and
that
is
an
important
distinction;
the
right
to
compensation
versus
the
deterrent
effect.
the
deterrent
effect
will
be
there
because
it
almost
every
consumer
case,
i'm
using
the
word
quite
loosely,
in
every
case
brought
by
a
non-business
consumer
i
think
the
court
would
find
that
there
has
been
a
companion
case
brought
by
a
business
consumer.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
i'm
sorry?
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
beltone
case?
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
in
the
hearing
a
case
of
what
we
have
right
here,
there
were
also
dealer
actions
brought.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
prior
to.
and
perhaps
a
year
or
two
before,
this
case
was
brought.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
no.
however,
i
point
out
that
in
terms
to
the
deterrent
effect,
if
the
court
will
examine
almost
every
action
that
has
been
brought
by
a
non-business
consumer,
it
will
find
that
almost
every
situation.
there
is
also
been
a
companion
case
brought
by
a
business
consumer.
therefore,
the
deterrent
effect
not
lost
by
the
fact
that
the
non-business
consumer
cannot
bring
the
action.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
there
must
be
a
commercial
or
business
interest
involved.
if
they
had
just
said
business
without
property
for
example,
it
would
have
excluded
the
kind
of
industry
that
mr.
waldron
had
who
was
employed
in
one
business
but
was
injured
in
an
investment.
a
contract,
he
was
buying
and
selling
contracts
in
oil
importation.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
wasn't
his
business.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
but
not
to
his.
and
we
believe
that
the
court
--
the
congress
had
in
mind
interest
--
what
about
the
situation,
perhaps
of
owning
a
building.
that
is
a
piece
of
property,
and
that
may
be
an
investment.
that
is
not
your
business,
but
it
is
a
commercial
property
interest.
i
believe
in
1890,
the
court
saw
distinction
between
the
two.
there
had
to
be
a
reason
if
the
court
--
if
the
congress
mr.
justice
white
had
intended
that
everyone
recover,
then
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
well
certainly,
we
all
wish
we
knew
why
they
said
what
they
said.
we
believe
that
had
the
converse
was
to
be
true
if
they
intended
to
permit
everyone
to
have
a
right
for
compensation,
they
could
less
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
they
intended
to
cover
property
interest,
something
that
was
commercial.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
no.
the
answer
is
commercial
property
and
business,
and
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
it
covers
commercial
property
interest,
yes.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
yes,
it
does
sir.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
the
answer
is
not
no.
it
covers
business
and
commercial
property.
are
there
any
questions
from
the
court?
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
in
the
pfizer
decision,
mr.
justice
stewart
looked
to
legislative
history
and
didn't
find
any
help
to
the
legislative
history.
he
then
went
to
other
areas
of
the
law
beyond
the
antitrust
area,
beyond
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
which
uses
the
term
person
found
that
foreign
governments
have
traditionally,
had
standing
to
sue
in
our
courts.
he
therefore
found
that
a
foreign
government
must
therefore
have
standing
to
sue
under
section
4.
in
our
case,
we
have
called
this
court's
attention
to
a
clear
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
a
person
who
buys
for
non-business
use
or
non-commercial
use
does
not
have
standing.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
can't
conceive
a
situation
where
any
government
would
buy
in
a
non-business
or
non-proprietary
capacity.
if
it
is
buying
rugs
for
its
state
office
building
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
in
our
opinion
that
anything
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
yes,
they
would.
in
our
opinion
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
the
difference
being
that
you
are
not
a
state
or
a
government
purchaser
(voice
overlap)
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
yes.
and
that
is
they
will
have
--
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that
is
correct.
and
you
point
out
--
you
point
out
the
inequities
of
the
situation
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
we
concede
those
inequities
may
exist.
they
may
trouble
all
of
us.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
there
is
no
business
there.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
that's
right.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
they're
in
the
business
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
if
that's
the
case,
i'm
sorry.
if
they
are,
yes.
mr.
elliot
s.
kaplan
then,
they
would
be
in
the
business,
that's
correct.
thank
you.
