justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
thomas,
if
you
--
why
didn't
the
congress
simply
say
any
person
injured
rather
than
injured
in
his
business
or
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
thomas,
suppose
that
it
in
the
course
of
an
antitrust
conspiracy,
someone
like
your
client
who
was
not
in
business
is
slandered.
do
you
think
that
that
would
be
an
injury
to
her
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
business.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
business
or
property
exclude
that
would
not
have
been
excluded
if
it
simply
uses
the
word
injury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
consumer,
you
mean
all
of
the
purchaser?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
no
jurisdictional
limitation
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
or
minimum
on
any
view
private
antitrust
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
parens,
mr.
warren
spannaus,
you
mean
parens
patriae?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
its
derivative,
isn't
it?
i
mean
if
you
were
to
hold
that
the
consumers
had
no
right
here,
it
would
rather
significantly
diminished
the
scope
of
the
parens
patriae.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
you
as
parens
patriae
say
that
state
of
minnesota
could
recover
for
mrs.
reiter's
lost,
eventhough
she
could
not
herself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
insurance
industry
heard
about
it
55
years
later
in
southeastern
underwriters.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kaplan,
what
if
mrs.
reiter
here
had
alleged
he
need
the
hearing
aid
to
adequately
perform
as
a
lawyer.
she
was
in
the
business
of
a
lawyer
--
of
being
a
lawyer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
though
it's
really
just
unemployed
consumers
kind
of
bit
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mr.
kaplan,
have
you
been
reading
the
papers
till
last
year
for
which
you
realizes
this
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
on
popular
results.
what
about
the
chattanooga
language
of
justice
holmes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
would
at
least
have
to
divide
--
disavow
what
you
considered
to
be
dictated
in
the
case,
would
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
read
as
a
gloss
on
the
language
any
injury
to
business
or
property
that
it
must
be
suffered
by
a
business
consumer?
