mr.
john
e.
thomas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
my
name
is
john
thomas.
i'm
a
sole
practitioner
from
saint
paul,
minnesota.
i
have
seated
10
minutes
of
my
argument
time
to
the
federal
government,
so
i
have
20
minutes.
i
intend
to
try
and
to
keep
possibly
five
for
rebuttal,
and
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
first
of
all,
the
issue
this
morning
that
we're
faced
with
is,
whether
or
not
consumers
in
the
united
states
may
recover
overcharges
paid
for
price
fixed
good
as
injury
occurred
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
in
their
property.
i
will
quickly
outline
my
argument
points
if
i
may
please.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
yes.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
oh,
i'm
--
mr.
john
e.
thomas
the
outline
of
my
argument
points
this
morning
would
be
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
classify
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
as
it
may
as
one
of
policy
contrary
to
the
warnings
of
this
court
in
antitrust
decisions.
secondly,
we
look
at
the
statute
language
exactly
what
it
does
say
which
i
say
is
in
the
disjunctive.
then,
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
opinions
of
this
court
starting
with
mr.
justice
holmes
in
chattanooga
foundry
through
mr.
justice
marshall
and
hawaii
versus
standard
oil,
and
in
through
each
one
of
the
justices
here
what
they
said
in
pfizer
versus
government
of
india.
lastly,
i
would
then
like
to
describe
if
i
may
for
the
court,
what
i
see
the
result
of
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
being
which
is
--
severely
added
complication
to
the
antitrust
laws,
the
destruction
of
the
parens
patriae
legislation,
both
for
the
states
and
the
private
opt
out
provision
in
that
legislation,
and
finally,
the
elevation
of
foreign
governments
to
a
preferred
position
over
american
citizens.
first
of
all
policy,
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
eighth
circuit
opinion,
it
concludes
we
think
it
sensible
as
a
matter
of
policy.
to
me,
this
is
indirect
conflict
with
this
court's
warning
in
u.s.
v.
cooper
corporation
where
this
court
said
it
is
not
for
the
courts
to
indulge
in
the
business
of
policy
making
in
the
field
of
antitrust
legislation.
this
court
has
said
many
times
saint
paul
fire
and
marine
case
and
blue
shield
of
texas,
so
forth
that
the
starting
point
in
any
case
involving
a
statute
language
is
the
statute
language
itself.
let's
look
at
that,
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
reads,
any
person
who
shall
be
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
anything
forbidden
in
the
antitrust
law
shall
recover,
is
the
business
or
property
--
mr.
john
e.
thomas
well,
your
honor,
that
senator
hoar's
section
7
amendment
i
guess
to
senator
sherman's
initial
proposal,
and
at
that
time,
senator
which
i
believe
did
basically
read
that
way.
senator
hoar
said
there
is
no
change.
it
was
well
understood.
his
amendment
has
change
to
business
or
property.
so
i
would
say
that
it
reads
the
same
way.
the
dictionary,
black's
law
dictionary
of
course
says
or
is
in
the
disjunctive
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
will
touch
back
on
that
a
little
more
directly,
i'm
coming
to
it.
legal
scholars,
all
of
them
who
have
touch
on
this,
who
have
considered
this
question,
all
of
them,
through
professor
sullivan,
professor
bork,
all
of
them
say
that
it's
in
the
disjunctive
business
or
property
and
the
consumers
has
standing
to
recover
from
money
paid
for
price-fixed
goods.
professor
sullivan
says
that
mr.
justice
holmes
noted
it
was
in
the
disjunctive.
judge
wyzanski
in
referring
to
this
court
said
that
congress
and
the
courts
have
frequently
shown
their
regard
to
sherman
act
as
an
economic
charter
of
freedom
of
hardly
less
than
constitutional
dimensions.
it
deserves
ungrudging
and
as
sometime
said
liberal
reading
to
accomplish
its
purposes.
now,
this
court
in
pfizer
versus
india
where
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
the
majority
opinion
with
justices
brennan,
white,
marshall,
and
stevens
said
this,
the
petitioner's
argued
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
intended
to
protect
only
american
consumers,
and
those
justices
who
here
this
morning
said
concluded
clearly
therefore,
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
the
treble-damage
remedy,
and
i'm
going
to
hammer
on
that
term
remedy,
available
only
to
consumers
in
our
country.
that
was
what
the
majority
said.
the
dissent
lead
by
or
written
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger
with
justices
powell
and
rehnquist
said
this,
as
this
court
observed
last
term,
the
legislative
history,
the
treble-damage
remedy
which
does
exist
quoting
form
brunswick
now
indicates
that
it
was
conceived
of
primarily
as
a
remedy
for
the
people
of
the
united
states
as
individuals,
especially
consumers.
and
then,
this
is
the
language
of
that
three
judges.
it
said,
what
we
so
recently
saw
as
primarily
a
remedy
for
american
consumers
is
now
extended
all
nations
of
the
world,
and
that
was
the
cause
for
the
dissent.
mr.
justice
powell
who
wrote
a
separate
dissent
noted
this
all
important
case
of
georgia
v.
evans
where
the
state
of
georgia
by
the
asphalt
for
its
roads
was
a
consumer?
and
mr.
justice
powell
apparently
saw
no
direct
legislative
history
but
he
said
this,
in
georgia
v.
evans,
a
clear
policy
to
protect
the
states
of
the
union
was
reflected
and
the
antitrust
laws
and
in
the
legislative
history.
the
court
could
perceive
no
reason
for
believing
that
congress
wanted
to
deprive
a
state
such
to
consumer
here
as
purchaser
of
commodity
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
of
the
civil
remedy,
there
is
that
term
remedy
again,
of
treble-damages
which
is
available
to
other
purchasers
who
suffer
through
violation
of
the
act.
those
are
the
words
of
all
the
justices
here,
those
three.
now,
remedy,
come
back
to
that
term
remedy,
legislative
history,
we
can
go
right
back
to
senator
hoar
where
he
in
1890,
he
raised
this
question.
he
said
to
senator
sherman,
he
inquired
and
he
said
--
he
asked
sherman
if
the
purpose
was
to
give
private
citizens
a
civil
remedy
in
the
courts.
senator
sherman
replied,
certainly,
the
second
section
gives
a
private
remedy
to
every
person
injured.
now,
this
court
in
u.s.
v.
cooper
corporation
cited
and
relied
on
that
and
said
in
u.s.
v.
cooper,
private
purchaser
is
given
a
remedy
under
the
antitrust
laws.
in
footnote
10
of
the
brunswick
corporation
versus
pueblo
bowl-o-mat,
this
court
again
is
considered
what
legislative
history
there
is
and
concluded,
it
is
a
remedy,
a
specially
for
consumers
and
it
is
opening
the
door
of
justice
to
every
man.
and
that's
why
we're
here
this
morning.
the
result
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
this
as
i
see
it,
and
that's
why
i
ask
this
court
in
--
to
reverse.
defendants
defined
property,
they
say
this.
this
court
should
now
hold
the
property
is
this
they
say,
“a
commercial
pursuit
or
interest
unconnected
with
one's
business
or
primary
livelihood.”
well,
we've
heard
judge
wyzanski
say
what
this
court
had
said
over
the
years
that
the
sherman
act
is
of
constitutional
proportions.
this
type
of
definition
belongs
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
as
we
all
know
from
that
code,
this
is
the
type
of
thing
you
get
there
where
we
would
fight
over.
is
it
connected?
is
it
unconnected
with
one's
business?
what
is
the
primary
livelihood?
their
definition
would
turn
the
antitrust
as
a
private
antitrust
practitioner.
it
would
turn
it
into
a
three-ring
circus,
and
i
used
to
be
a
tax
lawyer
many
years
ago.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
yes,
your
honor
in
my
brief
i
believe
or
and
i
know
it
was
repeated
in
the
amicus.
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
in
the
--
my
petition
on
my
brief,
but
the
labor
exemption
under
the
sherman
act
defined,
that's
the
only
place
where
we
see
property
and
business
defined
separately.
property
basically
equals
dominion
over
something.
business
really
equals
what
your
time
is
spent
on
in
a
game.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
excuse
me?
mr.
john
e.
thomas
yes,
i
would
say
it
does
have
to
be
a
commercial
transaction
in
our
market
place,
in
our
free
enterprise
competitive
society,
where
it's
just
general
distraction
to
trees
for
example,
from
pollution,
no.
as
fedex
recreation
type
of
activity
--
mr.
john
e.
thomas
yes,
but
not
--
mr.
john
e.
thomas
right,
exactly.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
then,
we
get
into
the
target
area
question
your
honor
which
judge
larson
did
describe
and
did
find
here.
if
it's
caused
by
oil
company's
fixing
the
price
of
gasoline
driving
down
the
highway
--
mr.
john
e.
thomas
oh,
an
injury
to
business,
not
an
injury
to
property?
mr.
john
e.
thomas
oh.
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
it
affects
you
on
the
balance
sheet,
it
is
money
and
that
it
causes
a
decrease.
i
was
thinking
of
that
yesterday
your
honor
again.
and
generally,
i
guess
everything
goes
to
the
bottom
line
in
our
business
society,
and
that
is
a
tough
one.
so
long
as
you're
in
business,
i
guess
that
would
be
a
property
damage.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
no,
absolutely
not.
you
have
to
be
in
business.
there
are
many
antitrust
cases
that
do
hold
that
in
fact,
they
have
one
file
on
myself
a
business
slander
is
compensable
under
the
antitrust
laws,
but
not
for
a
individual
consumer,
no.
they
would
have
to
be
in
--
mr.
john
e.
thomas
--
business
pursuit,
yes
your
honor.
the
result
as
i
see
it
--
oh,
and
that's
a
trilogy
of
cases
decided
by
judge
williams
out
in
california
and
if
you
read
those,
you'll
see
one
in
particular.
this
is
the
further
complication
that
will
come
up.
he
anguished,
he
felt
he
might
be
creating
a
frankenstein
monster
here
because
he
said,
suppose
a
woman
goes
and
buys
two
dresses.
one,
to
use
in
putting
on
an
opera
for
profit,
second
one,
to
go
out
anniversary
dinner
with
her
husband.
the
first
one
subject
to
compensation
under
the
antitrust
law,
second
one,
apparently
not.
and
he
was
in
anguished
over
that
and
saying
in
effect
what
am
i
doing?
help
me
out
ninth
circuit,
help
me
out
supreme
court,
and
judge
nickerson
said
in
the
theophil
case
in
new
york
he
said,
he
hoped
this
court
would
hold.
the
ninth
circuit
has
reserved
opinion.
the
eighth
circuit
has
destroyed
the
parens
patriae
legislation
because
its
derivative
for
the
states
as
to
the
actions
of
consumers.
they're
representing
consumers.
secondly,
here's
an
interesting
point.
the
parens
patriae
legislation
has
an
opt
out
provision,
an
opt
out
provision
for
private
parties.
now,
that
would
be
if
this
court
doesn't
reverse
the
eighth
circuit
that
would
be
like
a
pilot
announcing
at
30,000,
“this
plane
is
in
trouble
ladies
and
gentlemen.
you
all
of
course
are
free
to
bailout,
but
obviously
we
have
no
parachutes.”
and
you
see
what
i'm
saying?
the
opt
out
provision
is
opting
out
into
nothing
under
the
parens
patriae.
if
unless
there's
a
private
right
of
action
for
that
person.
foreign
governments
as
we
now
stand,
combining
this
decision
by
the
eighth
circuit
with
the
decision
in
pfizer
versus
government
of
india,
foreign
governments
are
now
preferred
over
american
citizens,
and
that
foreign
governments
buy
price-fixed
goods
from
defendants,
supplied
them
to
their
citizens.
let's
say
its
antibiotics,
let's
say
its
hearing
aids.
trun
around,
an
american
citizens
buy
those
same
prize-fixed
goods
from
the
defendants.
the
foreign
governemnts
can
come
in
and
has
standing
before
this
court
because
the
eighth
circuit
in
their
opinion
to
get
around
mr.
justice
holmes
and
chattanooga
foundry.
the
eighth
circuit
said
that
that
was
a
business
injury,
arguably
a
business
injury.
and
you
better
believe
that
foreign
governments
will
be
in
here
arguing
obviously
that
in
every
instance,
it's
a
business
injury
for
them,
supplying
water,
supplying
hearing
aids,
supplying
antibiotics.
but
what
about
american
citizens?
surely,
they
may
come
before
this
court.
and
that
was
when
--
the
only
the
eighth
circuit
really
got
around
mr.
justice
holmes.
i
see
no
way
of
getting
around.
he
really
saw
this
and
defined
it.
and
i
would
please
ask,
these
are
my
main
points
that
i
wish
to
touch
on,
to
hit
on,
and
i'm
keenly
interested
if
the
court
has
any
particular
area.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
wow!
the
question
here
this
morning
your
honor,
no.
i'm
the
counsel
in
beckers,
you
may
or
may
not
know
that,
the
case
that
was
just
denied
cert,
but
it
has
nothing
here.
but
of
course,
the
first
thing
i'm
going
to
be
hit
with
when
we
go
back
is
in
illinois
brick
motion
and
i
think
that
this
court,
if
it
saw
fit
in
his
wisdom,
there's
a
footnote.
that
is
to
me
is
purely
a
question
of
law
that
could
be
decided
in
that
“pass-on”
is
not
in
this
case.
it's
a
retail
price
fixing
question.
and
therefore
as
a
matter
of
law,
illinois
brick
does
not
apply.
but
the
defendants
have
said
in
the
footnote
in
their
brief
that
they're
going
to
bring
an
illinois
brick
motion
as
soon
as
we
get
back
down,
anticipating
reversal
by
this
court.
so
yes,
it
does
your
honor,
but
not
here
this
morning
directly.
is
there
any
other
area
that
anybody
would
--
mr.
john
e.
thomas
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
other
members
of
this
court,
i
have
nothing
to
say
in
rebuttal.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
yes.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
excuse
me.
mr.
john
e.
thomas
that
this
price
fixed?
yes,
your
honor
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
there
are
certain
courts
in
this
country
that
are
managing
those
cases.
the
other
side
of
it
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
from
the
judicial
aspect
that
the
judges
are
free
to
say
i
cannot
manage
this
case.
there
is
a
milk
case
out
in
arizona
where
they
actually
sent
out
the
class
--
notices
excuse
me,
under
the
court
direction
on
the
milk
cartons.
they
could
go
out
on
the
bread
wrappers,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
