justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
gather
that
you
can
be
injured
in
your
property
without
being
injured
in
your
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
property
interest
here
is
being
deprived
of
too
much
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kaplan,
could
you
explain
for
me
again
why
you
think
congress
use
both
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
injury
to
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
an
injury
to
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
strange
way
to
cover
just
the
things
you
want
to
say
is
to
say
property,
if
all
that
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
cover
the
things
you
just
mentioned,
that's
a
strange
way
of
doing
it.
why
didn't
they
just
say
commercial?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
congress
intended
then
to
cover
something
besides
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
does
cover
something
besides
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
does
cover
something
besides
business
like
i
say,
yes
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
answer
is
not
no?
