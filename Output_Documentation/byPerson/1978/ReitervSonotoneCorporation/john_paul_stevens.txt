mr.
thomas,
do
you
suggest
that
the
words
business
or
property
are
used
in
the
disjunctive?
do
you
suggest
they
have
different
meanings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
this
is
property
could
--
isn't
property
always
a
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
ever
be
injured
in
your
business
without
also
being
injured
in
your
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
if
conspiracy
somehow
rather
by
slowing
down
scientific
progress
is
--
cause
damage
to
a
lot
of
trees,
that
wouldn't
be
injury
to
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
on
business,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
you're
a
lumber
company,
would
that
be
an
injury
to
your
business
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
it
isn't
that
important,
but
i
just
didn't
quite
understand
how
one
could
have
an
injury
to
his
business
that
was
not
also
an
injury
to
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
there
was
not
also
under
your
theory
clearly
also
an
injury
to
property
and
so
i
wonder
how
significant
the
disjunctive
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
question
i
have
mr.
thomas,
do
you
think
illinois
brick
case
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
--
if
such
a
violation
occurred
make
the
business
less
valuable,
and
therefore
hurt
his
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
if
this
is
crucial,
but
it
has
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
if
you're
presumably
pursuing
under
section
4,
you
try
to
get
some
money,
you
have
to
prove
actual
damages
in
order
to
have
something
to
treble?
justice
john
paul
stevens
given
the
understanding
of
the
reach
of
the
commerce
clause
in
1890
by
the
people
who
enacted
the
law,
it's
really
sort
of
unrealistic
to
talk
about
whether
they
actually
thought
about
this
particular
kind
of
action,
isn't
it?
that's
probably
why
they
can
discuss
it
very
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
again,
that
may
not
be
dispositive
here,
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shenefield,
it
just
ran
through
my
mind
that
you
said
does
it
make
any
sense,
did
it
make
any
sense
for
congress
to
say
in
substance
that
if
a
citizen
has
a
claim
that
worth
over
$10,000.00,
he
can
raise
it
--
raise
the
federal
question
federal
court
but
he
only
has
a
$10.00
claim
he
may
not?
yet,
they
did
just
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
a
difference
i
suppose,
the
practical
difference
between
a
suit
by
a
city
for
a
million
dollar
pipe
purchase
and
a
$10.00
purchase
by
an
individual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
georgia
recovered
once
as
a
consumer,
isn't
it?
georgia
case
with
--
georgia
was
the
plaintiff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
he
doesn't
need
the
statute
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
wilheim,
if
we
should
adopt
the
rule
that
you
urge
us
to
adopt,
it
would
apply
to
price
fixers.
so,
i
don't
know
why
that's
an
unfair
argument.
he's
saying
we
shouldn't
adopt
the
rule
that
will
give
him
immunity
about
to
price
fixers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
one
of
that
class?
justice
john
paul
stevens
nevertheless,
you're
the
spokesman
for
those
bad
fellows
on
that
issue
we
have
to
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you're
still
the
spokesman
for
the
price
fixers
because
the
way
we
decide
the
case
will
depend
--
will
determine
how
those
people
can
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
better
take
the
hard
facts
and
meet
them
square-on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
about
all
the
language
in
the
cases
and
debates
and
all
about
the
purpose
to
protect
consumers
as
the
ultimate
objective
of
this
legislation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
they
had
mrs.
reiter
in?
she
seems
to
fit
that
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
still
an
injunction
that
mrs.
reiter
is
going
to
get.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
she's
already
got
the
hearing
aid.
she
already
paid
for
it?(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
she
cannot
go
to
the
attorney
general
and
convince
him
to
bring
a
parens
patriae?
let's
say
she
rather
go
to
the
lawyer
on
the
corner
and
say
all
i
want
is
about
$9.00
on
this
thing,
they
overcharged
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
she
have
to
go
through
all
of
these
to
get
her
$9.00?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
she
bought
an
oriental
rug
or
perhaps
she
bought
a
house
and
didn't
like
the
commission
she
was
charged.
she
wanted
to
complain
about
the
fixing
of
broker's
commission.
they're
didn't
like
the
fee
their
lawyer
was
charging
because
there
are
minimum
fee
schedules.
there
are
a
lot
of
individual
consumer
claims,
it
might
have
amount
to
enough
money
to
precipitate
litigation,
and
you'd
rule
all
of
those
out
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
kind
of
deterrent
would
remain
for
a
conspiracy
among
retail
oriental
rug
dealers
if
your
view
prevails?
what
would
be
the
deterrent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
of
those
have
succeeded?
how
many
parens
patriae
actions
where
there
in
the
last
80
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
many
out
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
you
are
really
fully
dealt
with
the
chattanooga
case
because
as
i
recall
the
case,
mr.
justice
holmes
first
indicated
that
he
did
not
have
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
city
was
in
the
business
of
supplying
water.
therefore,
put
the
business
aspect
to
one
side,
and
therefore
relied
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
there
was
an
overcharge
for
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
which
seems
to
me
that
take
the
commercial
aspect
out
of
the
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
specifically
did
as
i
remember
it.
i
may
remember
it
incorrectly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wasn't
quite
sure
you
start
to
answer
why
the
pfizer
case
wasn't
important
or
didn't
control,
and
i
never
quite
understood
the
end
of
your
answer,
you
just
started
discussing
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
your
argument
applies
to
foreign
governments
who
buy
drugs
for
non-commercial
use?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
they're
buying
drugs
for
their
army
to
use
to
bandages
to
bandage
up
people
who
get
wounded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
they
have
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
bought
bandages
for
my
family,
i
would
not
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
preferred
physician
to
foreign
government?
