chief
justice

e.

we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
reiter
against
sonotone
corporation.
mr.
thomas,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
thomas
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
find
it
more
convenient
to
elevate
the
lectern
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
with
the
crank,
each
of
the
other
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
probably,
no
questions
at
this
stage
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shenefield.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
taking
quid
that
if
time
for
that
to
surface,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
recall,
mr.
shenefield,
the
legislation
that
was
introduced
within
recent
years,
two
or
three
at
most,
it
was
called
the
toothpaste
amendment
that
--
because
one
of
the
illustrations
was
that
all
of
the
consumers
of
a
particular
brand
of
toothpaste
could
tack
their
claims,
mass
their
claims
at
75
cents
per
tube,
and
achieve
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
same
concept
you're
presenting
here
today.
that
was
rejected
by
the
congress
or
at
least
it
was
not
enacted
here.
are
you
familiar
with
that
mr.
shenefield?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
called
the
toothpaste
amendment
because
that's
the
way
the
debate
in
the
congress
evolved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
difference,
any
basic
difference
between
massing
the
claims
or
tucking
the
claims
of
consumers
of
toothpaste
and
doing
so
with
reference
to
hearing
aids
or
electric
toothbrushes
or
whatnot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
there
be
a
deterrent
effect
if
“x”
millions
of
people
are
allowed
to
10
cent
per
toothpaste
rebate?
you
could
--
have
no
difficulty
with
the
jurisdictional
aspect
if
you
could
mass
them
and
--
i
have
difficulty
seeing
the
difference
between
what
is
being
advanced
here
and
--
if
your
view
prevailed,
you
wouldn't
need
an
amendment
to
the
statute
to
mass
with
the
toothpaste
claims
would
you
or
toothbrush
claims?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
colleague
referred
to
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
as
being
basically
a
policy
decision,
given
the
background
in
this
whole
area,
is
this
not
something
congress
could
correct
very,
very
swiftly
if
the
eighth
circuit
is
wrong
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
they
thought
that
the
eighth
circuit
was
perhaps
correct
but
they
wanted
to
enlarge
their
remedies.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
were
often
--
its
often
suggest
that
that
we
should
--
the
court
should
take
steps
because
the
legislative
process
is
will
put
on
the
slow
side.
that's
not
a
reason
for
its
decision,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wilheim.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
timing
is
very
good
mr.
wilheim.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kaplan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
a
difference
mr.
kaplan
between
merchandise
which
is
fungible
and
merchandise
which
is
not?
i
suppose
hearing
aids
like
automobiles
fall
into
certain
categories,
but
oriental
rugs
--
one
oriental
rug
is
unlike
its
any
other
oriental
rug
in
the
world,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
rather
considerations
beside
is
that
--

justice

in
illinois
brick.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
kaplan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
a
question
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
for
you
mr.
thomas.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory
of
the
case,
suppose
an
action
were
brought
by
a
housewife
saying
that
there
were
nine
people
in
their
household
and
they
consume
three
loaves
of
bread
everyday,
i
don't
know
what
bread
is
now
but
it's
around
50
cents
i
guess
or
maybe
more,
and
that's
21
loaves
of
bread
a
week
and
she's
being
overcharged
15
cents
per
loaf
and
that
she's
acting
on
behalf
of
all
the
people
who
buy
loaves
of
bread
in
st.
paul,
minneapolis,
covered
by
the
theory
of
your
case
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
