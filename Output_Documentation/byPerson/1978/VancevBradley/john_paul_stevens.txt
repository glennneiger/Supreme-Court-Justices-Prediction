justice

mr.
solicitor
general
that
wasn't
an
equal
protection
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
can
i
pursue
this
remark
as
you
are
really
raising,
really
a
quite
a
fundamental
point
that
i'm
not
sure
the
court
has
ever
squarely
addressed.
do
you
suggest
that
the
test
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
is
totally
dependent
on
the
conditions
at
that
time
the
statute
is
enacted
or
is
it
conceivable,
say
in
the
area
of
sex
discrimination,
that
a
discrimination
that
was
perfectly
reasonable
when
adopted
because
very
few
women
worked
for
example;
might
75
years
later
be
totally
irrational
because
there
is
no
distinction
anymore
in
employment.
could
a
statute,
which
was
originally
reasonable
or
satisfied
the
equal
protection
principles
become
unconstitutional
merely
by
passage
of
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
soon
as
you
have
conceded
that
then
aren't
we
just
confined
to
looking
at
rationality
as
of
today
because
if
it's
totally
irrational,
well
then
of
course
it's
bad,
whenever
that
the
rationality
arises,
if
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
it,
but
let
me
just
be
sure,
i
catch
your
position
clearly
in
mind.
you
do
concede
but
if
the
court
concluded
that
today
the
statute
was
irrational,
then
you
would
loose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
hostetler,
this
prompts
me
to
ask
you
rather
basic
question
about
the
theory
of
your
case.
as
you
point
out,
there
are
two
separate
classifications
created
by
the
statute.
one,
between
persons
working
for
the
foreign
service
who
are
over
60
and
the
other
under
60
and
secondly
a
classification
of
foreign
service
versus
civil
service,
which
of
the
two
do
you
rely
on
as
making
the
statute
unconstitutional
or
do
you
rely
on
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
contend
then
that
if
all
government
employees
had
to
retire
at
age
60,
the
statute
would
still
be
unconstitutional?
i
didn't
so
understand
your
brief,
but
i
like
to
know
whether
you
are
so
contend?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say
if
everything
is
exactly
the
same,
but
just
everybody
has
to
retire
at
age
60,
would
you
still
say
this
statute
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
are
right
on
this
we
don't
even
have
to
look
at
the
comparison
with
the
civil
service?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
this
theory,
we
don't
even
have
to
look
at
what
happens
to
civil
service?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
hostetler
right
i
know
you
are
going
to
talk
more
about
murgia.
i
don't
mean
to
cut
it
off,
but
this,
i
have
another
very
basic
question
that
troubles
me.
on
the
second
half
of
the
discrimination
and
that
over
60
versus
under
60,
but
foreign
service
versus
civil
service
you
say
that's
a
separate
independent
reason
for
holding
a
statute
unconstitutional.
and
i
would
like
to
test
the
notion
that
the
government
has
a
constitutional
obligation
to
treat
all
like
employees
equally.
do
you
say
and
you
have
a
package
of
benefits
here,
if
these
people
who
performed
essentially
the
same
work,
they
were
paid
different
salaries
would
the
lower
paid
group
have
a
lawsuit
to
get
the
same
amount
of
compensation
as
the
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
no
justification
in
terms
of
difference
in
employment,
say
there
are
secretaries
with
the
same
rate
of
speech,
same
skills,
work
the
same
number
of
hours
in
the
same
working
conditions
and
all
the
rest
but
one
group
is
paid
$25
a
week
more
than
the
other,
is
there
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
have
different
salary
scales,
different
promotion
policies,
different
vacation
schedules,
would
those
things
violate
a
constitutional
duty
of
the
united
states
government
to
treat
all
employees
equally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
not
then
why
is
there
any
constitutional
issue
here
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
must
start
as
i
understand
your
theory,
you
must
start
from
the
premise
that
the
united
states
government
has
a
duty
to
treat
like
employees
equally.
is
there
a
duty
of
equal
treatment
to
employees?
and
if
there
is,
why
does
it
justified
mandatory
requirement,
not
salary
vacations
and
everything
else,
that's
seems
to
me
something
you
have
to
be
able
to
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say
they
are
both
women,
say
they
are
both
women,
don't
introduce
another
element?
