mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
presents
the
question,
whether
section
632
of
the
foreign
service
act
of
1946,
which
requires
that
persons
covered
by
the
foreign
service
retirement
system
to
retire
at
age
60,
violates
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
united
states
constitution.
appellees
are
six
former
and
four
current
foreign
service
employees
in
the
department
of
state
or
the
international
communications
agency,
formerly
the
united
states
information
service
and
an
organization
representing
such
employees,
filed
this
action
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
act.
they
made
statutory
as
well
as
constitutional
claims
and
sought
a
declaration
of
invalidity,
injunctive
relief,
back
pay
and
reinstatement.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
primary
non-constitutional
claims,
including
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
claim
and
appellees
abandoned
the
remaining
non-constitutional
claims.
a
three-judge
court
was
then
convened
to
consider
the
constitutional
contentions.
appellants
contended
that
the
constitutional
issue
was
a
question
of
law
and
moved
for
summary
judgment.
appellees
argue
that
the
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue
required
the
presentation
of
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
distinguishing
between
foreign
service
employees,
who
must
retire
at
age
60
and
civil
service
employees
who
at
that
time
could
continue
to
work
until
age
70.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
am
unable
to
furnish
that
information
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
is
the
compulsory
retirement
age
and
it
is
less
than
70.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
armed
services
have
or
at
least
on
the
naval
side
have
an
upper
out
program
and
a
person
is
retired
or
selected
out
if
he
isn’t
promoted
within
a
certain
number
of
years.
this
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
at
a
given
age.
this
court
considers
that
in
schlesinger
versus
ballard
not
very
long
ago
and
upheld
in
that
case
a
distinction
between
male
and
female
officers.
male
officers,
i
believe
had
to
move
up
or
out
after
nine
years
in
grade
and
female
officers,
13
years.
and
this
court
found
that
there
was
a
sufficient
difference
in
their
circumstances
because
of
the
different
nature
of
assignments
so
that
the
female
officer
had
fewer
chances
for
promotion
and
therefore
she
might
be
given
13
years
in
grade
instead
of
nine
and
of
course
that
impinges
upon
the
issue
here
as
we
will
argue
subsequently.
at
the
time
this
action
was
brought,
civil
service
employees
were
required
to
retire
at
age
70,
but
on
april
6,
1978,
congress
enacted
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
amendments
of
1978,
repealing
the
statute
requiring
most
civil
servants
to
retire
at
age
70
and
currently
effective
september
30,
1978,
there
is
no
compulsory
retirement
age
for
most
civil
servants.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
would
appear
that
would
follow.
this
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
that
certainly
is
so.
the
court
below
thought
at
one
time
that
a
challenge
was
made
to
age
60,
but
that
appellees
would
accept
age
70
and
in
fact
in
a
footnote
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
satisfied
that
an
age
70
mandatory
retirement
for
foreign
service
officers
would
be
valid.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
oh!
no,
this
was
in
the
court's
opinion.
it
later
struck
from
its
opinion
the
footnote
that
indicated
that
appellees
had
failed
to
show
that
age
70
was
not
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
government
purpose,
although
it
had
held
that
age
60
was
not
rationally
related.
but
after
the
amendment
came
along,
it
struck
this
portion
of
its
footnote
and
now
as
the
court
suggests
a
foreign
service
officer
or
other
persons
in
the
foreign
service
retirement
program
apparently
would
have
indefinite
service
as
would
and
as
do
other
civil
servants.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
hostetler
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
they
would
have
indefinite
service?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
believe,
i
believe,
i
recall
that,
but
it
would
seem
logically
to
me
that
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested
that
we
couldn't
pull
age
70
out
of
the
air
and
impose
it.
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
from
both
sides
and
submissions
in
response
to
the
court's
request
for
supplementation
of
the
record
the
court
treated
the
case
as
if
it
had
been
submitted
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
and
declared
the
mandatory
retirement
provision
unconstitutionally.
we
submit
that
the
court
correctly
recognized
that
neither
fundamental
rights
nor
suspect
classes
are
involved
in
the
distinction
between
foreign
service
employees
and
civil
service
employees
and
that
therefore
the
rational
basis
test
is
the
appropriate
one
and
that
the
statute
therefore
is
presumptively
valid
and
the
challengers
have
a
heavy
burden
of
proving
invalidity.
nevertheless,
although
it
applied
as
we
suggest
the
proper
standard,
the
court
held.
“on
the
record
established
in
this
case,
the
early
mandatory
retirement
cannot
survive
even
this
minimal
scrutiny.”
the
court
in
considering
the
proffered
justifications,
first
that
the
special
stresses
and
unique
burdens
of
employment
in
the
foreign
service
is
a
result
of
frequent
and
extensive
changes
in
environment,
often
accompanied
by
exposure
to
unfamiliar
and
unfavorable
living
conditions
and
second
the
implementation
that
it
afforded
to
the
personal
management
program
for
foreign
service
officers
did
not
discuss
the
legislative
history
at
all
of
these
two
purposes,
but
made
its
own
assessment
of
the
employment
conditions
of
foreign
service
and
civil
service
employees.
and
in
doing
so
it
concluded
that
less
that
10%
of
the
american
civilians
who
work
overseas
for
the
government
are
forced
to
retire
at
age
60
as
many
of
the
overseas
personnel
--
personnel
not
subject
to
mandatory
retirement
have
jobs
similar
to
those
of
the
foreign
service
personnel
and
may
be
stationed
also
in
hardship
posts.
accordingly,
it
held
upon
this
determination
that
a
system
under
which
some
federal
employees
working
abroad
are
singled
out
for
early
retirement
is
“patently
arbitrary
and
irrational
and
it
invalidated
the
legislation.”
we
contend
that
the
district
court
erred
in
not
considering
the
legislative
history,
and
in
substituting
its
judgment
for
the
decision
of
the
congress
to
create
a
separate
foreign
service
with
its
own
combination
of
benefits
and
obligations.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
if
the
court
please,
the
agency
for
international
development
is
involved
in
the
foreign
service
retirement
act.
it
and
the
former
united
states
information
service,
its
now
the
international
communications
agency
and
the
foreign
service
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
now
includes
them
as
well
as
the
foreign
service
officers
and
persons
with
officer
grade
or
reserve
officer
grade
as
well.
this
court
held
in
usery
versus
turner
elkhorn
mining
that
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
maybe
sustained
by
looking
solely
to
concerns
expressed
in
the
congressional
hearings
and
debates
because
in
that
case
the
three-judge
court
refused
to
accept
evidence
and
this
court
satisfied
itself
of
the
rational
relationship
by
merely
looking
at
the
congressional
history.
this
court
also
in
whalen
versus
roe
in
1977,
considered
a
challenge
to
a
new
york
drug
prescription
computer
scheme.
that
was
a
scheme
under
which
a
physician
dispensing
certain
schedule
ii
drugs,
which
were
opium
derivatives
and
cocaine
was
required
to
prepare
in
triplicate
a
report
indicating
the
name
of
the
physician
who
prescribed
the
drug,
the
name
and
address
of
the
patient
and
the
quantity
of
the
drug
prescribed
and
then
to
turn
this
over
to
the
state
government,
which
then
would
place
it
into
a
computer
bank
and
the
intention
was
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
recurrence
of
prescription
by
certain
physicians
or
the
filling
of
prescriptions
unduly
by
certain
pharmacists
or
the
acquisition
of
narcotics
by
certain
patients.
this
was
challenged
and
the
court
said
this
that
the
state's
interest
in
control
of
narcotic
drugs
is
valid
and
the
scheme
is
reasonably
related
and
the
fact
that
the
district
court
held
that
the
state
had
failed
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
working
--
was
not
invalidating.
it
said
it
was
enough
to
see
that
there
was
a
rational
relationship
between
the
scheme
and
the
objective
which
was
a
control
of
the
narcotics
trade
or
traffic.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
was
not
an
equal
protection
case,
but
it's
illustrative
we
submit
here
in
showing
that
the
failure
of
proof
to
show
that
a
scheme
works,
it
doesn't
destroy
a
determination
that
it's
rational
and
doesn't
therefore
require
the
court
to
invalidate
it
and
that
seems
to
be
what
happened
here.
the
district
court
entertained
evidence
and
determined
that
large
numbers
of
civil
servants
were
living
abroad
under
circumstances,
which
it
found
indistinguishable,
at
least
legally
indistinguishable
from
those
of
the
foreign
service
people
who
are
under
the
mandatory
retirement
and
for
that
reason
determine
that
there
was
no
rationality
to
the
program
and
we
suggest
that
if
the
rationality
is
demonstrated,
evidence
that
it
doesn't
include
everyone
or
that
it
might
be
done
in
another
way
or
that
it
just
doesn't
work,
doesn't
invalidate
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
whalen
versus
roe,
the
court
quotes
from
mr.
justice
brandeis,
who
suggests
that
the
states
must
be
given
latitude
to
experiment
in
methods
of
solving
the
problems
with
which
it's
confronted.
and
if
the
program
is
rationally
related,
the
state
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
see
whether
it
works
and
it
shouldn't
be
invalidated
just
because
it
cannot
demonstrate
on
a
challenge
that
it
is
working.
another
quotation
from
that
if
i
may,
the
new
york
statute
challenged
in
this
case
presents
a
considered
attempt
to
deal
with
such
a
problem.
it
is
manifestly
the
product
of
an
orderly
and
rational
legislative
decision
and
we
submit
that
the
language
that
is
manifestly,
the
product
means
that
this
court
will
apply
its
experience
and
its
general
knowledge
to
determine
rationality
and
it
doesn't
require
evidentiary
proof
of
a
relationship,
but
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
below
did
in
substituting
its
judgment.
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
goes
back
to
1924
when
a
single
foreign
service
was
first
established.
the
foreign
service
act
of
1924
is
sometimes
known
as
the
rogers
act
because
of
congressman
rogers,
i
believe
of
massachusetts
who
was
its
principal
sponsor
and
since
this
is
the
only
direct
legislative
history,
i
would
ask
the
indulgence
of
the
court
to
permit
me
to
read
from
a
colloquy
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives.
when
the
principal
sponsor,
the
1924
legislation
representative
rogers,
explained
that
foreign
service
officers
would
be
required
to
retire
five
years
earlier,
at
time
age
65,
than
civil
service
employees
who
just
four
years
earlier
were
first
brought
under
a
mandatory
retirement
at
age
70.
because
as
he
said
foreign
service
officers
like
military
personnel,
but
unlike
most
civil
service
employees,
commonly
were
rotated
among
remote
posts
overseas
and
frequently
experienced
disruptive
changes
in
their
way
of
life.
mr.
rogers
said,
“i
think
the
analogy
of
the
foreign
service
officer
to
the
army
officer
and
to
the
naval
officer
is
much
more
complete
than
to
the
civil
service
employee
in
washington.
the
foreign
service
officer
is
going
hither
and
yon
about
the
world,
giving
up
fixed
places
of
abode,
often
rendering
difficult
and
hazardous
service
of
prime
importance
to
the
united
states.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
exactly
so
and
in
fact
the
location
of
hardship
posts
change,
but
there
are
still
hardship
posts.
one
of
the
changes
that
has
occurred,
of
course,
is
the
emergence
of
the
new
nations,
principally
in
africa,
in
sub-saharan
africa
and
which
normally
did
not
have
members
of
our
foreign
service
because
they
would
attend
the
seat
of
government
of
the
nation
that
had
colonized
these
now
emerged
nations.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
to
the
extent
that
there
was
commerce
and
intercourse
with
those
nations
to
justify
it,
but
with
those
colonies
to
justify
it,
but
just
as
what
might
have
been
a
hardship
posts
in
1924
when
representative
roger
spoke,
isn't
now,
so
there
are
new
posts,
which
may
even
be
--
present
more
hardships.
i
will
also
like.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
anticipated
my
very
next
remark.
i
thank
you
for
it.
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
in
schlesinger
versus
ballard,
the
case
that
we
earlier
discussed
involving
the
naval
officers
in
footnote
12,
which
is
the
very
last
footnote
to
the
opinion
of
the
court.
the
court
says
exactly
that,
that
it
is
for
the
congress
to
decide
when
conditions
no
longer
justify
a
distinction
that
was
valid
at
the
time
it
was
imposed
and
we
would
submit
that
that
is
peculiarly
a
legislative
judgment
to
be
made.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
have
to
concede
the
possibility
that
it
might,
but
i
think
unless
it
was
manifestly
unconstitutional
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
there
is
any
question
whether
its
still
bears
a
rational
relationship,
we
must
then
indulge
the
congress'
right
to
make
that
determination.
i
think
only
when
we
would
find
that
it
was
irrational
that
it
(inaudible)
over
relationship
and
but
in
that
event
i
would
agree
with
the
court
that
the
court
could
make
the
determination
itself,
but
we
suggest
that
here,
that
is
and
so
at
all
because
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
think
i
would
have
to
conclude
that,
but
i
would
say
that,
it
would
have
to
be
manifestly
so
and
the
congress
and
it
--
the
court
would
have
to
conclude
that
its
rationality
could
not
be
maintained
on
any
basis
at
all,
such
as
the
court
said
in
mcgowan
versus
maryland,
we
would
have
to
particularly
in
a
case
like
this
where
we're
using
where
we
don't
have
a
fundamental
right
involved
in
order
to
we
have
a
suspect
class.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
oh!
i
would
agree
that
this
is
something
of
which
the
court
should
take
notice
just
as
i've
suggested
that
the
court
should
have
looked
at
the
earlier
legislative
history
of
this.
however
if
it
did
looked,
it
would
see
that
in
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act,
the
foreign
service
was
excluded
from
the
lifting
of
the
age
70
ceiling.
now
there
is
some
suggestion
that
perhaps
it
was
excluded
because
there
was
some
haste
in
getting
the
matter
through
the
congress
and
they
did
not
want
to
route
it
through
a
committee
different
from
the
foreign
service
committee,
which
should
be
a
committee
different
from
the
committee
to
consider
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
amendments,
but
it's
significant
that
the
congress
did
accept
it
and
did
recognize
that
it
was
still
different.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
thank
you
for
the
question
and
i
would
certainly
say
yes,
the
court
should
take
that
into
consideration
and
that
was
the
second
justification
that
was
offered
to
the
three-judge
court
that
this
implemented
the
up
or
out
program
that
the
foreign
service
uses
and
that
also
would
indicate
that
it
still
had
that
it
still
bore
a
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
aim
or
a
legitimate
objective.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
would
be
a
significant
change,
but
there
might
be
other
factors,
factors
other
than
just
being
stationed
at
a
hardship
post.
one
of
the
factors
might
be
the
recurrence
of
change,
the
fact
that
a
person
could
hardly
sync
his
wits
in
one
place.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
so;
we
would
suggest
that
perhaps
the
differences
within
the
united
states.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
certainly
agree
with
the
court
that
that
is
a
phenomenon
of
our
current
lifestyle,
but
i
would
suggest
that
being
moved
from
one
continent
to
another
or
being
subject
to
removal
is
a
more
traumatic
upheaval
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
that
were
if
those
where
the
circumstances
attendant
to
all
posts,
the
news
recently
has
had
a
sensational
story
and
a
very
tragic
story
that
included
the
death
of
a
member
of
the
congress,
investigating
a
situation
in
guyana,
one
of
the
recently
emerged
nations
in
south
america,
with
congressmen
ryan
and
shaw,
was
richard
dwyer
who
was
aged
47,
he
was
under
the
mandatory
retirement
age
considerably
and
he
was
the
deputy
chief
of
mission
in
georgetown
and
his
duties
required
him
to
accompany
persons
to
a
dangerous
site
and
he
had
we
presume
the
vigor
of
a
person
47
years
old
and
was
subjected
to
this
risk
of
his
life
and
so
we
would
submit
that
the
day
of
the
hardship
post,
the
day
of
the
extraordinary
risk,
the
day
of
the
exposure
to
more
than
ordinary
civil
servants'
experience
has
not
passed.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
does
not
and
the
court
reminds
me
that
at
the
last
olympia
there
was
a
terrorist
incident,
but
we
suggest
that,
that
is
further
evidence
that
there
is
a
rational
relationship
of
having
persons
with
the
physical
vigor
and
stamina
to
be
able
to
rise
to
these
problems
which
can
occur
any
place
because
one
would
hardly
call
munich
a
hardship
post
in
terms
of
the
creature
comforts
that
it
affords.
if
the
court
please,
i
believe,
i
have
about
2
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
will
submit
our
case
on
argument
unless
the
court
asks
questions.
thank
you.
