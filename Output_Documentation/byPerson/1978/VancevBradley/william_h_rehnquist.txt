does
that
mean
that
if
the,
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
there
would
simply
be
no
retirement
age
for
foreign
service
officers?
justice
william

we
certainly
couldn’t
substitute
a
70
out
of
the
air
i
take
it
if
there
is
no
congressional
70-year
old
requirement
at
the
present
time?

was

general
mccree
following
up
on
my
brother
stevens
question,
if
we
are
to
consider
rationality
or
irrationality
as
of
the
present
day,
are
we
then
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
subsequent
legislation
by
congress
such
as
the
up
and
out
promotional
system,
which
was
not
a
part
of
the
enactment
in
1924,
but
certainly
if
you
put
it
in
the
matrix
of
the
present
day
as
a
part
of
the
foreign
service
law
in
determining
rationality.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler,
what
then
is
the
state
of
the
law
if
this
court
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
district
court?
are
foreign
service
officers
required
by
law
to
retire
at
70
now
and
if
so
by
what
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
presume
that
we
affirmed
it,
we
would
dissolve
the
stay
so
that
if
it
were
affirmed
and
the
litigation
came
to
a
close,
would
they
be
required
by
law
to
require
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
is
the
right
of
a
civil
service
employee
to
work
or
not
to
work
in
the
face
of
a
congressional
proscription
or
mandatory
retirement
dependent
on
the
opinion
of
a
three-judge
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
secretary
of
state
do
when
a
member
of
the
foreign
service
“reaches
the
age
70?”
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed
by
this
court,
does
he
retire
in
person
to
the
act
of
congress
or
does
he
just
go
back
to
court
and
ask
for
instructions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
usually
there
is
some
other
statute
that
could
well
be
held
to
be
governing
and
it's
the
comparison
between
people
governed
by
the
other
statute
and
the
people
governed
by
the
statute
held
unconstitutional
is
struck
down.
so,
there
is
an
automatic
reversion
to
the
statute
that
it
is
still
valid.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
gone.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
hostetler
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
hostetler,
supposing
that
congress
were
to
say
that
because
of
the
high
rate
of
unemployment,
no
person
should
hold
any
government
job
for
more
than
30
years.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
on
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
a
justification
for
an
up
and
out
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
a
justification
then
for
an
up
and
out
policy
that
if
you
haven't
made
a
certain
level
in
the
service
by
a
certain
age
then
you
must
get
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
attack
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
that
the
mandatory
retirement
provision
may
have
some
domino
effect
on
the
willingness
to
or
choice
of
voluntary
retirement
at
age
55,
that
is
if
people
didn't
know
they
were
going
to
have
to
retire
at
60,
they
may
or
might
not
voluntarily
retire
at
age
55?
