ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
turns
on
facts.
it
presents
one
simple
narrow
issue
to
this
court
and
that
is
was
the
court
below
which
studied
the
facts,
wrong
when
it
concluded
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
mandatory
retiring
before
age
70,
the
particular
group
of
white
collar
employees
involved
in
this
case.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
they
are
certainly
within
the
prerogative
of
this
court
to
review
the
record
and
to
determine
whether
the
court
below
was
mistaken
and
--
but
think
that
is
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
no,
but
i
submit
that
the
facts
will
show,
if
this
court
looks
at
those
facts,
that
there
is
in
fact
no
rational
basis
for
the
statute
at
issue
and
mr.
justice
burger
you
inquired
about
the
armed
forces.
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
all
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
question
of
whether
this
particular
group
of
white
collar
office
workers
are
unable
to
perform
the
particular
jobs
that
they
are
assigned
in
the
foreign
service
between
the
ages
of
60
and
70
or
are
less
able
to
perform
than
are
employees
under
the
age
of
60.
this,
to
affirm
the
court's
decision
below
will
not
require
this
court
to
upset
its
decision
in
murgia
nor
will
it
require
this
court
to
hold
that
mandatory
retirement
can
never
be
applied
to
people
such
as
the
uniformed
policemen
in
murgia,
who
have
physical
jobs
and
for
whom
an
earlier
mandatory
retirement
age
can
be
said
to
have
a
rational
basis
to
the
particular
jobs
that
they
have
to
perform.
and
certainly
in
the
armed
forces
we
all
know
that
our
military
men
and
women
must
be
in
combat
readiness
and
must
be
either
fighting
war,
or
prepare
to
fight
wars.
my
point
now
however
that
in
the
defense
department
all
of
the
civilian
employees,
large
numbers
of
whom
travel
throughout
the
world
and
in
fact
spend
15,
20
and
25
years
in
service
overseas
are
not
subject
to
early
mandatory
retirement
but
in
fact
are
treated
as
civil
service
employees.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
who
referred
to
the
point
you
raised
with
mr.
solicitor
general,
this
case
will
raise
only
the
issue
of
whether
employees
in
the
foreign
service
between
the
ages
of
60
and
70
were
able
to
perform
the
work
of
the
foreign
service.
the
court
below
asked
us
on
several
occasions,
whether
we
were
claiming
that
mandatory
retirement
within
the
age
is
unconstitutional.
and,
we
made
it
very
clear
that
we
were
not
making
that
claim
and
the
evidence
that
we
submitted
went
primarily
to
show
that
employees
between
the
ages
of
60
and
70
are
able
to
perform
their
particular
jobs
of
the
foreign
service.
we've
really
did
not
try
to
introduce
the
evidence
or
to
make
the
argument
that
employees
over
the
age
of
70
can
also
perform
that
work.
i
think
that
argument
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
no,
the
court's
order
below
has
been
stayed
and
so
at
a
present
time
they
are
still
required
to
retire
at
age
60.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
i
don't
believe
so
because
the
court
below
very
clearly
said
in
its
opinion
that
the
foreign
service
could
not
retire
employees
before
the
age
of
70,
that
they
have
--
or
entitled
to
work
until
age
70,
but
court's
opinion
below
does
not
say
that
they
may
work
after
70.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
if
it
is
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
that's
right.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well
there.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
there
are
civil
service
employees
who
are
required
to
retire
before
age
--
that
are
still
mandatorily
required
to
retire,
a
law
enforcement
personnel
for
example,
air
traffic
controllers
for
example.
in
other
words
the
question
turns
on
the
particular
job
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
rational
basis.
now,
it
is
true
that
they
were
still
be
left
open
for
a
constitutional
litigation
on
the
other
day,
whether
foreign
service
employees
should
have
the
right
to
work
without
any
mandatory
retirement
age
at
all.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
issue
isn't
there,
i
am
only
saying
that
we
did
not
litigate
that
issue
in
this
case
and
its
only
fair
to
bring
to
your
attention
that
we
did
not
and
that
the
court
did
not
focus
on
that
issue
and
if
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
or
very
little
evidence
going
to
the
point
of
whether
or
not
a
statute
required
mandatory
retirement
at
some
age
over
70
is
or
is
not
rational.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
we
have
ten
years
until
some
one
reaches
70
and
i
would
suppose
that
in
that
period
of
time
the
state
department
will
decide
what
it
wants
to
ask
congress
to
do
in
light
of
the
fact
that
a
provision
of
the
statute
has
been
declared
unconstitutional.
this
circumstance
often
happens
when
a
provision
of
a
statute
is
held
unconstitutional.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
there
would
be
no
automatic
reversion
to
the
civil
service
statute
because
the
civil
service
statute
simply
doesn't
apply
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
--
to
foreign
service
employees.
no,
the
foreign
service
statute
will
still
be
a
separate
statute
totally
apart
from
the
civil
service
statute
and
from
the
age
discrimination
point
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
that's
correct
and
then
there
would
be
no
provision
in
the
foreign
service
act
as
to
foreign
service
employees.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
there
would
be
retirement
at
any
age
unless
congress
chooses
to
impose
another
mandatory
retirement
age
over
70.
let's
suppose
congress
imposes
an
age
of
72
or
73,
then
it
is
still
open
to
question
whether
that
age
is
constitutional.
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
retiring
foreign
service
employees
at
age
72?
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
there
is
two
ways
to
look
at
the
classification
in
this
case.
one
is
that
this
foreign
service
statute
itself
makes
a
classification.
it
puts
in
one
category
foreign
service
employees
who
are
under
the
age
of
60
and
able
to
and
in
another
category,
foreign
service
employees
over
the
age
of
60.
and
in
one
instance
it
allows
the
foreign
service
employees
below
the
age
of
60
to
continue
to
work
so
long
as
they
are
able
to
perform
and
in
the
other
it
does
not.
another
way
to
look
at
the
classification
is
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
with
some
exceptions
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
that's
right.
ambassadors
are
not
subject
to
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
no,
i
have
not.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
we
have
not
in
this
case
that's
correct.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
absolutely.
so
long
as
the
legislature
has
a
rational
basis.
so
long
as
there
is
a
rational
relationship
between
the
classification
and
mandatory
retirement
age
at
any
age
and
the
objective
of
the
state,
it's
certainly
up
to
congress
to
do
that.
and
in
fact
there
might
be
many,
many
classifications
and
many,
many
mandatory
retirement
statutes
that
will
still
exist
certainly
the
armed
forces
will
no
doubt
continue
to
have
lower
mandatory
retirement
age.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
we
rely
on
both.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
no,
if
all
employees
had
to
retire
at
age
60,
we
would
still
contend
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
we
would
have
made
somewhat
different
arguments.
let
me
put
it
in
another
way.
if
there
were
no
civil
service
employees
working
overseas.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
yes,
because
societal
patterns,
societal
norm
today
is
to
allow
people
to
work
until
age
70.
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
allows
persons
in
the
private
sector
to
work
until
age
70
and
indeed
makes
it
wrong
for
employers
to
fire
people
before
age
70.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
that's
correct
you
don
not
have
to
look
at
the
civil
service.
the
fact
that
civil
service
employees
worked
until
age
70
at
the
time
this
suit
was
brought
and
now
work
until
they
choose
to
retire
and
the
fact
that
some
civil
service
employees
work
overseas
in
the
same
kind
of
jobs
is
simply
cumulative
evidence
to
the
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
requiring
foreign
service
employees
because
of
the
nature
of
their
jobs
to
retire
as
early
as
age
60,
an
age
which
is
far
below
an
age
accepted
in
society
today
as
an
age
to
quit
working
an
age
which
is
below
what
all
the
medical
and
scientific
evidence
shows
a
person
is
able
to
work.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
amendments
that
were
recently
passed
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
--
now
mean
as
a
result
of
those
amendments,
that
if
the
foreign
service
employees
can
be
retired
at
age
60
they
will
be
virtually
the
only
white
collar
workers
in
the
whole
country.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
we
have
to
look
at
the
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
no,
we
have
to
look
at
actual
facts
and
data
in
society,
many
of
which
is
reflected
in
this
record.
for
example
we
submitted
un-contradicted
evidence
that
corporations,
non-profit
organizations,
churches,
missionary
groups,
work
overseas
employ
thousands
of
volunteers,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
volunteers
and
employees
and
employ
them
between
the
ages
of
60
and
70.
the
undisputed
evidence
is
that
those
employees
are
as
able
to
work
overseas
or
as
competent
as
employees
under
the
age
of
60.
in
short,
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
employees
working
overseas
between
the
ages
of
60
are
not
competent
to
perform
their
work.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
that's
perfectly,
alright,
i
do
not
see
that
any
constitutional
infirmity
to
that.
in
fact
the
government
now
has
changed
years
in
several
of
its
agencies.
for
example
in
the
peace
corp,
for
different
reasons.
in
the
peace
corp
an
employee
may
not
work
for
more
than
5
years.
there
is
nothing
wrong
within
showing
turnover
in
an
agency
on
a
fair
basis,
a
term
of
years
is
applied
across
the
board
equally
to
everyone
is
not
discriminatory,
is
not
irrational.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
that's
correct
but
a
turn
there.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
and
the
armed
forces
also
have
a
term
of
years,
all
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
marshal
is
that
i
don't
see
a
constitutional
infirmity
in
an
agency
or
government
imposing
term
of
years
on
government
employment.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
that's
the
kind
of
a
system
that
we
have
in
the
foreign
service
is
not
linked
to
age
so
much
but
year-after-year,
every
year
employees
in
the
foreign
service
are
evaluated
and
they
are
ranked
ordered
in
their
classes,
those
in
the
bottom
percentages
of
their
classes,
which
varies,
it
has
range
from
7-10%
are
selected
out.
ms.
zona
f.

no
we
are
not
attacking
the

fact.

we
agree
with
the

that
murgia
is
a
controlling
case.
we
see
nothing
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
murgia
with
the
case
--
with
the
decision
below
in
this
court.
ms.
zona
f.

not
at
all,
the
government
--
ms.
zona
f.

the
government
may
impose
different
terms
of
employment
to
any
number
of
categories
so
long
as
each
term
is
constitutionally
in
balance.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
there
might
be
if
the
conditions
were
precisely
the
same
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
imagine
that
working
conditions
in
two
different
agencies
would
be
precisely
the
same
and
that
their
talents
and
requirements
of
the
workforce
in
each
agency
--
in
the
respective
agencies
would
be
precisely
the
same.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
no,
we
are
not
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
we
are
not
here
claiming
that
foreign
service
employees
must
be
treated
exactly
the
same
as
civil
service
employees.
we
are
simply
saying
that
foreign
service
employees
are
being
discriminated
against
because
their
livelihood,
their
work
is
being
taken
away
from
them
at
the
age
of
60
when
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
that
work
being
taken
away.
it
assumes
that
older,
the
post
60-year
olds
are
simply
unable
to
perform
any
longer.
ms.
zona

well,
if
there
were
two
employees
in
the
foreign
service,
a
man
and
a
woman
let
us
say,
performing
exact
the
same
work,
yes,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
government
to
say,
we
are
going
to
pay
the
man
more
or
we
are
going
to
give
him
a
greater

ms.

alright,
[attempt

both

and
let's
suppose
a
government,
the

was
being
arbitrary
in
choosing
to
favor
one
woman
over
the
other,
but
in
most
instances
mr.
justice
stevens
i
must
say
the
government
will
offer
some
rational
explanation
for
the
distinction
and
treatment.
it
will
say
this
person
has
a
degree
and
the
other
does
not.
this
person
works
late
and
the
other
does
not.
ms.
zona
f.

if
the
government
could
offer.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
i'm
--
i
guess
i
misunderstood.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
that
would
be
equal
protection
law
suit
and
that
will
the
same
the
claim
certainly.
mr.,
no
i
am
sorry.
the
essential
point
in
this
case
is
that
although
the
court
below
requested
the
government
on
several
occasions
to
submit
facts
to
show
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
the
age
60
retirement
the
government
was
simply
not
able
to
do
so.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
whether
what
it
showed
constitutes
legislative
history,
they
showed
legislative
statements
and
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well,
that
was
a
legislative
history
of
1924
act,
not
the
legislative
history
--
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
no
right,
but
that
wasn't
enacted
years
before
the
1946
act
and
it's
just
not
relevant.
moreover
the
colloquy
omits
the
context
in
which
it
occurred.
if
you
will
look
at
our
brief,
i
believe
on
page
29
to
30
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
the
full
colloquy
set
forth
and
you
will
see
that
in
1924,
there
was
no
retirement
system
whatsoever
for
consular
and
diplomatic
officers
and
purport
of
that
rogers
act
was
to
give
to
certain
place
a
retirement
system.
it
was
to
give
an
opportunity
for
foreign
service
officers
to
retire
and
to
receive
a
pension.
there
was
no
consideration
of
whether
or
not
foreign
service
employees
had
to
retire
at
age
65
because
they
were
no
longer
able
to
perform
the
work
overseas.
in
1946,
when
this
provision
came
into
effect,
the
legislative
history
is
silent.
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
age
60
provision.in
fact,
it
is
curious
that
as
world
health
standards
have
improved
and
life
expectancy
has
increased
over
the
years,
the
retirement
age
in
the
foreign
service
has
gotten
lower
and
lower.
before
1924
there
was
no
retirement
age,
in
1924
when
life
expectancy
was
58,
the
retirement
age
was
65
and
now

expectancy

the

however,
there

no
evidence
that
the

attack
is

related.
foreign
service
employees
moreover
are
not
armed,
are
not
expected
to
resist
or
counter
terrorist
attack
or
other
violence
and
in

we
send
our
ambassadors
who
are

of

probably

[attempt

now
let's
look
at
the
facts
underlying
the
government's
argument
that
mandatory
retirement
is
a
necessary
management
tool,
which
the
government
needs
to
make
room
for
younger
officers
thereby
ensuring
components
of
the
ambassadorial
or
other
high
levels
of
the
officer
core.
at
the
outset,
let's
keep
in
mind
that
3,000
of
these
employees
or
one-third
of
the
10,000
workforce
are
not
even
officers.
there
are
librarians
and
school
teachers
and
the
like.
and
mandatory
retirement
of
these
employees
hardly
ensures
confidence
at
the
ambassadorial
or
other
high
levels
of
the
officer
core.
secondly,
we
are
talking
about
a
a
de
minimus
number
of
employees
who
are
likely
even
to
want
to
continue
to
work
past
the
age
of
60.
ms.
zona
f.
hostetler
well
that's
the
point
i
was
just
beginning
to
make
mr.
justice
burger.
we
are
talking
about
the
fact
that
only
50
employees,
44
officers
are
still
on
the
employment
rolls
at
the
age
of
59.
the
overwhelmingly
most
common
age
for
retirement
among
social
retirees
today
is
age
62.
only
5,000
of
1%
of
federal
civil
service
employees,
civil
service
employees
even
stay
under
the
civil
service
rolls
until
age
70.
there
was
such
a
de
minimis
number
of
officers
at
age
60,
who
are
likely
to
want
to
continue
to
work
past
60
that
it
simply
is
not
creditable
that
they
are
going
to
clog
up
the
upper
levels
of
the
foreign
service
or
that
they
are
going
to
in
fact
have
an
appreciable
effect
on
morale
or
recruitment.
moreover
keep
in
mind
that
in
the
foreign
service,
unlike
the
civil
service
an
employee
is
not
hired
to
perform
a
particular
job.
a
foreign
service
employee
must
accept
assignment
to
any
post
in
the
world
and
must
perform
any
job
given
him
whether
or
not
it
is
of
nature
ordinarily
performed
by
someone
at
that
rank.
in
fact,
it
is
quite
common
in
the
foreign
service
for
employees
to
perform
work
that
does
not
commensurate
with
their
grade
level.
the
foreign
service
also
has
broad
administrative
authority
to
assign
its
employees
to
other
government
agencies,
to
state
and
local
governments,
to
non-profit
organizations
and
to
universities.
thus
the
foreign
service
has
a
variety
of
mechanisms
to
ensure
that
there
is
turnover
both
at
the
top
level
jobs
and
in
every
other
jobs
to
provide
employees
with
new
job
assignments
and
new
challenges
and
to
bring
to
any
positions
in
the
foreign
service
employees
who
have
not
previously
served
in
them
and
who
may
have
new
ideas
and
let's
look
at
the
kind
of
employee
that
is
likely
to
be
in
this
scoop
of
50
employees
still
on
the
employment
rolls
at
the
foreign
service
at
the
age
of
60.
every
year,
11,000
applicants
apply
for
the
foreign
service.
only
100
to
200
are
taken
in.
however,
they
enter
they
are
rank
ordered
every
year,
the
bottom
portions
of
the
classes
are
selected
out,
those
who
are
not
promoted
are
selected
out,
those
who
fail
by
any
or
medical
examinations
are
selected
out.
there
are
voluntary
retirements
at
age
50,
beginning
at
age
50
with
age
55
being
the
most
common
age
of
voluntary
retirement.
people
resign
shortly
after
they
enter
the
foreign
service
when
they
find
that
foreign
service
life
is
not
to
their
liking.
and
thus
of
the
44
officers
who
remain
in
the
service
at
age
59,
they
are
presumably
by
the
department's
own
criteria
the
cream
of
the
crop.

well,
they
have
no
doubt

have
some
effect
on
that.
but
if
you
would

committee
on

issued
this
year
in
connection
with
the
age
discrimination
in

act
amendments,
you
will
see
that
there
were
many
factors
that
employees,
workers
take
today
into
account
deciding
on
early
retirement
and
the
fact
that
they
are
going
to
have
to
retire
anyway
at
some
point
is
but
one
of
a
large
number
of
factors
and

no.
[attempt

no,
we
agree
with
the
government
that
murgia
is
the
case
most
nearly
on
point
that
it
is
in
accord
with
reed
and
trimble
and
craig
versus
boren
and
this
court's
other
decisions
in
recent
years
in
the
equal
protection
area
that
it
simply
says
to
courts
below
that
they
must
look
at
the
facts
in
the
record
to
see
if
there
is
in
fact
a
rational
basis.
whether
there
is
a
fair
not
arbitrary
and
substantial
not
tenuous
relationship
between

objective
of

you
applied
this
reasoning
in
murgia
and
you
found
that
there
was
a
rational
basis.
the
court
applied
the
reasoning
to
the
facts
at
hand
and
found
that
there
was
not
a
rational
basis.
there
was
nothing
inconsistent
with
the

decision
and
with
the

of

below.
i
submit
that
it
should
be
affirmed.
