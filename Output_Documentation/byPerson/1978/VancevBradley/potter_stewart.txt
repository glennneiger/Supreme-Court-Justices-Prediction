your
sister
on
the
other
side,
mrs.
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
disagrees
with
that,
isn't
it,
at
least
in
the
brief
disagrees
with
that
conclusion?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
as
i
read
it
her
briefs
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
includes
only
--
at
least
many
of
the
staff
jobs
or
secretarial
jobs
and
jobs
like
that
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
a
good
many
things
have
happened
both
in
the
world
and
in
our
country
since
1924,
haven't
they,
both
in
terms
of
where
a
civil
service
employees
might
be
employed,
and
that
is
where
they
might
be
located
in
their
employment
and
also
on
terms
of,
it's
almost
like
air
conditioning
and
fast
transportation
and
communication
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
we
would
have
consular
officers
in
those
colonies
[inaudible]
wouldn't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
was
terrorism,
vulnerability
to
terrorism
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
chronological
age,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
was
a,
this
is
a
constitutional
law
attack
at
least
as
it
survived
originally.
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
some
statutory
issues,
but
now
it's
purely
based
upon
the
so
called
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
that
attack
must
be
that
foreign
service
officers
and
civil
service
officers
are
equivalent
and
therefore,
it
violates
the
constitution
for
the
congress
to
treat
them
differently.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
they
are
equivalent
then
where
does
the
age
70
come
into,
come
into
the
picture
now
that
congress
has
repealed
that
with
respect
to
foreign
service
--
with
civil
service
employees?
justice
potter
stewart
it
won't
if
this
provision,
it
won't
remain
if
it's
invalidated,
if
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
retirement
at
any
age?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
that
age
as
such
as
constitutional
or
whether
that
age
compared
to
civil
service
employees
is
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
with
some
exceptions?
justice
potter
stewart
people
above
amassadorial
rank
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
have
made
no
equal
protection
attack
upon
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
based
upon
that
differentiation.
