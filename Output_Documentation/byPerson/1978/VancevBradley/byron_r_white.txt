justice
byron
r.
white
section
632
of
the
foreign
service
act
of
1946
requires
that
all
employees
subject
to
the
foreign
service
retirement
system
retire
at
age
60.
in
contrast,
at
the
time
the
suit
was
brought,
government
employee
is
subject
to
the
civil
service
retirement
and
disability
system,
were
not
required
to
retire
until
age
70.
and
now
any
retirement
age
has
been
removed.
a
three-judge
court
held
that
this
difference
in
retirement
ages
discriminated
against
foreign
service
personnel
and
that
the
discrimination
was
an
invidious
one
that
violated
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
we
reversed
that
judgment.
our
reasons
are
elaborated
in
the
opinion
that
has
been
filed
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
