arguments
first
this
morning
and
the
1254
vance,
the
secretarial
state
against
bradley.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
is
the
present
retirement
age
for
a
general
officer
in
the
military
service,
do
you,
if
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
something
less
[voice
overlap]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
a
given
age?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
event
mr.
solicitor
general
are
those
considerations
which
we
are
entitled
to
take
into
account
or
those
considerations
for
the
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
analysis
mr.
solicitor
general
made
by
the
court
in
the
consideration
of
the
case,
whether
the
court
–
should
the
court
take
into
account
that
congress
is
indicating
a
very
great
alertness
in
recent
years
to
age
discrimination,
gender
discrimination
and
other
such
factors.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
hostetler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
court
was
in
any
better
position
to
make
that
evaluation
than
we
are
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
am
trying
to
get
out
is
whether
--
or
the
review
here
is
any
different
from
the
“review”
made
by
that
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
correctly
understand
your
observation
about
air
traffic
controllers,
for
example,
as
one
example
you
gave
that,
this
within
the
power
for
congress
to
fix
a
low
age
for
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
used
the
phrase
societal
norms
and
accepted
by
society,
who
sets
those
norms?
what
sort
of
norms
are
you
referring
to,
the
general
public?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
miss
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
my
question
goes
to
who,
who,
what
entity,
what
is
the
source
of
determining
that
something
is
a
societal
norm?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
talking
about
an
act
of
congress,
that
describes
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
the
previous
question,
i
take
it
as
it
is
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
government
can't
offer
any
explanation.
what
if
the
government
can?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
then
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
two
women
or
two
men
doing
the
same
work
and
are
not
paid
the
same,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
requires
the
court
order
the
government
to
pay
them
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
oliver
randall
home
stayed
here
until
his
90s,
but
that
doesn't
prove
we
can
alter
it,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
congress
has
entitled
to
take
into
recount
the
importance
of
attracting,
bright,
abled
the
younger
people
in
and
take
into
account
the
further
fact
that
must
they
move
people
up
and
out
of
their
senior
levels?
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
offer
as
attractive,
a
career?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
hope
you
are
not
forgetting
mr.
justice
marshal's
question
about
murgia
or
do
you
feel
you
have
dealt
with
that
enough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
