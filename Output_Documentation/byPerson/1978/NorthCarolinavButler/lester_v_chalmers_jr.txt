mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent,
willie
thomas
butler,
was
apprehended
and
arrested
by
special
agent
david
c.
martinez
and
other
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
on
may
3,
1977
in
an
apartment
located
in
new
york
city.
upon
an
unlawful
flight
warrant
to
avoid
prosecution,
agent
martinez
read
to
the
respondent
from
a
card
which
reads
as
follows.
“before
we
ask
you
any
questions,
you
must
understand
your
rights.
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
anything
you
say
can
be
used
against
you
in
court.
you
have
the
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
for
advice
before
we
ask
you
any
questions
and
to
have
him
with
you
during
questioning.
if
you
cannot
afford
a
lawyer,
one
will
be
appointed
for
you
before
any
questions
if
you
wish.
if
you
decide
to
answer
questions
now
without
a
lawyer
present,
you
will
still
have
the
right
to
stop
answering
and
at
any
time
until
you
talk
to
a
lawyer.”
the
petitioner
asserts
that
if
ever,
agent
fully
complied
with
the
prophylactic
rules,
as
announced
by
miranda,
and
the
current
policy
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
regarding
the
waiver
of
rights
in
the
use
of
form
fd
395,
as
appears
on
page
13
and
14
of
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general.
the
respondent
was
not
questioned
at
this
time
about
any
offense
that
occurred
in
north
carolina.
he
was
transported
by
the
agents
to
their
new
rochelle
office,
about
six
miles
away.
he
was
taken
to
an
interview
room
at
the
fbi
office
in
new
rochelle
and
then
handed
the
advice
of
rights
form
fd
395
and
subsequently
asked
whether
he
read
the
form,
and
he
nodded
his
head
and
said
he
had.
he
was
asked
if
he
understood
it
and
he
replied
he
did.
he
was
then
asked
to
sign
the
form
and
replied
that
he
didn't
want
to
sign
the
form
and
stated
“i
will
talk
to
you
but
i
am
not
signing
any
form.”
agent
martinez
further
testified
that
he
did
not
threaten
the
respondent
and
did
not
offer
him
any
hope
of
reward
or
inducement
to
get
the
respondent
to
talk
to
him,
and
they
did
not
use
any
misrepresentation,
trickery,
force,
or
coercion
to
get
the
respondent
to
talk
to
him.
that
the
respondent
was
in
the
possession
of
his
faculties
and
did
not
appear
to
be
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
or
narcotic
drugs.
that
the
respondent
told
him
that
he
had
11
--
an
11th
grade
education
and
that
the
respondent
appeared
to
know
what
was
going
on
about
him
and
appeared
to
respond
to
questions
in
sequential
fashion.
agent
martinez
further
testified
that
the
respondent
told
him
he
would
speak
to
him
without
a
lawyer,
that
the
respondent
never
told
him
that
he
did
not
want
a
lawyer
present,
nor
did
the
respondent
tell
him
that
he
did
want
a
lawyer
present.
that
he,
again,
informed
the
respondent
that
he
could
have
a
lawyer
and
that
one
would
be
appointed
for
him
if
he
so
desired,
and
that
he
asked
the
respondent
the
following
question.
“will
you
speak
to
us
knowing
full
well
that
you
have
these
rights?”
and
the
respondent
replied,
“i
won't
sign
the
form.
i
will
talk
to
you
but
i
won't
sign
the
form.”
martinez
further
testified
that
it
was
his
impression
that
the
respondent
did
understand
his
rights
and
did
not
necessarily
want
a
lawyer,
but
that
he
would
refuse
to
sign
any
type
of
paper.
the
trial
court
concluded
that
any
statements
made
by
a
respondent
to
special
agent
martinez
were
made
freely
and
voluntarily
after
the
respondent
had
been
advised
of
his
miranda
rights,
including
his
right
to
an
attorney
and
that
the
respondent
understood
these
rights
and
that
he
effectively
waived
these
rights,
including
the
right
to
have
an
attorney
present
during
the
questioning
by
his
indication
that
he
was
willing
to
answer
questions.
and
that
the
statement
made
by
the
respondent
was
made
at
a
time
when
the
respondent
understood
his
rights
and
that
no
promise
or
offer
of
an
illicit
nor
threats
or
pressure
or
coercion
of
any
type
had
been
exerted
against
him,
the
respondent
--
and
that
any
statement
or
confession
so
made
was
freely
and
voluntarily
given.
the
trial
court
then
admitted
into
evidence
the
exculpatory
statements
made
the
respondent
to
special
agent
martinez.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
reversed
the
trial
court
and
held
that
the
evidence
on
board
there
was
insufficient
to
support
the
finding
that
the
respondent
waived
his
rights
to
counsel
by
written
waiver
or
a
specific
oral
waiver
knowingly
made.
it
is
noted
and
called
to
the
court's
attention
that
this
interview
was
conducted
by
a
trained
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
that
he
rigidly
followed
the
current
fbi
procedures
as
they
appear
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
and
it
is
further
noted
that
chief
justice
warren,
at
pages
483
and
484,
commended
to
all
law
enforcement
agencies
the
practice
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
as
they
existed
at
that
time
with
respect
to
interviewing
suspects.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
stated
that
the
practice
of
the
fbi
can
readily
be
emulated
by
state
and
local
agencies.
and
in
a
footnote
on
page
55
--
footnote
55,
page
485,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
stated,
“we
agree
that
the
interviewing
agent
must
exercise
his
judgment
in
determining
whether
the
individual
waives
his
right
to
counsel
because
the
constitution
--
because
of
the
constitutional
basis
of
the
right.
however,
the
standard
for
waiver
is
necessarily
high
and,
of
course,
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
resolving
this
constitutional
question
lies
with
the
courts.
the
petitioner
does
not
challenge
the
continuing
validity
of
the
miranda
decision
nor
any
of
the
guidelines
it
established
to
protect
what
the
court
said
in
miranda
was
a
person's
constitutional
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
as
follows,
interpreting
this
court's
decision
in
miranda
in
the
absence
of
an
expressed
oral
or
expressed
written
waiver
of
right
to
counsel
prior
to
questioning,
does
miranda
allow
a
finding
of
an
implied
waiver
of
right
to
counsel
from
the
totality
of
the
surrounding
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
where
the
suspect
has
been
fully
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
before
making
voluntary
incriminating
statements
in
response
to
this
question
--
to
questioning.
resolution
of
this
question
turns
almost
entirely
on
the
interpretation
of
the
three
passages
in
miranda
--
in
the
miranda
opinion
which
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
relied
on
in
finding
a
per
se
violation
of
miranda.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
the
interpretation
of
the
three
passages
relied
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
at
page
474,
475,
and
479
of
miranda
should
not
lead
to
absurd
or
unintended
results
and
transform
the
miranda
safeguards
into
wholly
irrational
objects,
obstacles
to
legitimate
police
investigative
activity,
and
deprive
suspects
of
an
opportunity
to
make
an
informed,
an
intelligent
assessment
of
their
entries.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
do.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
i
can
only
say,
sir,
that
it
--
in
the
four
or
five
cases
that
our
court
has
had
this
question
raised
to
them,
they
have
strictly
interpreted
miranda.
and
to
answer
your
first
question,
sir,
it's
my
recollection
that
every
circuit
court
in
the
united
states,
including
the
district
of
columbia
and
20
of
our
sister
states,
interpret
miranda
opposite
from
our
north
carolina
supreme
court.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
we
--
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we
are
here,
sir.
what
do
these
passages
mean,
as
interpreted
by
north
carolina
supreme
court?
the
petitioner
asserts
that
they
do
not
mean
that
an
informed
waiver
of
a
right
may
be
ineffective
even
when
voluntarily
made.
as
mr.
justice
white
said
in
his
concurrent
opinion
in
michigan
against
mosley,
unless
an
individual
is
incompetent,
we
have,
in
the
past,
rejected
any
paternalistic
rule
protecting
the
defendant
from
his
intelligent
involuntary
decisions
about
his
own
criminal
case.
to
do
so
would
imprison
a
man
in
his
privileges
and
to
disregard
the
respect
for
the
individual
which
is
the
lifeblood
of
the
law.
the
petitioner
asserts
that
these
words
do
not
prohibit
every
element
which
influences
a
criminal
suspect
to
make
incriminating
admissions.
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
stated
in
united
states
against
washington,
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
preclude
a
witness
from
testifying
voluntarily
in
malice
which
may
incriminate
him.
for
all
his
competent
and
free
will
to
do
so
may
give
evidence
against
the
whole
world,
themselves
included.
indeed,
far
from
prohibited
by
the
constitution,
admissions
of
guilt
by
wrong
doers,
if
not
coerced,
are
inherently
disarmed.
in
addition
to
guaranteeing
the
right
to
remain
silent
and,
unless
in
here
if
it's
granted,
the
fifth
amendment
prescribes
only
self-incrimination
obtained
by
a
genuine
compulsion
testimony,
accordingly,
unless
the
record
reveals
some
compulsion,
respondent's
incriminating
testimony
cannot
conflict
with
any
constitutional
guarantees
of
the
privilege.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
stated,
at
page
188,
the
test
is
whether,
considering
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
free
will
of
the
witness
was
overborne.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
sir?
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
that's
--
that
is
the
position
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
that's
what
miranda
said,
yes.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
and
may
i
state,
sir,
that
in
michigan
against
mosley
you,
sir,
stated
that
a
blanket
prohibition
against
to
taking
a
voluntary
statement
or
a
permanent
immunity
from
further
interrogation
regardless
of
the
circumstances
would
transform
the
miranda
safeguards
into
wholly
irrational
obstacles
to
legitimate
police
investigative
activity
and
deprive
suspects
of
an
opportunity
to
make
informed
and
intelligent
assessments
of
their
interest.
we
say,
sir,
that
our
court
has
taken,
by
exposition,
taken
these
words
to
mean
that
the
suspect
is
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
make
an
informed
and
intelligent
assessment
of
his
interest,
and
to
take
whatever
action
he
voluntarily
chooses.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
i
think
that
any
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall.
it's
not.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir.
further,
the
position
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
the
petitioner,
that
these
words
were
not
intended
to
create
a
constitutional
safe
--
straightjacket,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
stated
in
michigan
against
tucker.
the
suggested
safe
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir.
i'm
saying
this,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
our
court,
by
its
interpretation
of
miranda,
has
placed
on
the
law
enforcement
agents
and
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
within
the
confines
of
the
north
carolina,
and
expressed
written
or
oral
waiver
before
any
statement
can
be
admitted
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
disregarding
entirely
any
circumstance,
any
gesture,
any
words
that
the
defendant
uses
to
give
to
the
trial
judge
at
the
trial
level
sufficient
facts
to
find
out
exactly
what
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think,
on
the
other
hand,
and
i'll
get
to
it
in
just
a
moment,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
what
our
north
carolina
court,
by
its
rule,
has
done
is
to,
in
effect,
add
another
sentence
to
those
litany
of
the
miranda
warnings
wherein
our
court
now,
by
its
interpretation
of
miranda,
would
now
require
this
court
to
add
the
litany
“since
you
decline
to
execute
a
written
waiver
of
your
rights,
do
you
know
expressly
orally
waive
these
rights?”
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
would
that
solve
the
question?
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
alright,
sir,
and,
suppose,
sir,
the
defendant
at
that
time
makes
no
statement
but
continues
on
talking?
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
well,
we
say
that
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir,
except
you
are
adding
to
the
litany
of
miranda
and
making
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
--
we
have
no
problem
whatsoever
with
the
fact
that
a
prisoner
or
a
suspect
should
be
fully
informed
and
should
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir,
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir,
that
--
and
we
face
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
north
carolina
with
respect
to
post
conviction
hearings
and
also
habeas
corpus
hearings
where
the
long
line
of
questions
asked
of
a
defendant
are
repudiated
at
a
later
date
in
denying
it.
and
i
don't
think
that
adding
one
other,
or
two
other,
or
three
other
sentences
to
the
long
list
that
we
have
on
the
defendant,
and
as
they
plead,
would
preclude
him
from
recanting
or
denying
that
he
voluntarily
plead.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
not
under--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
can't
say
that
it
is.
we're
dealing
with
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
we're
dealing
--
in
the
facts
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
an
fbi
agent,
a
highly
trained
sophisticated
law
enforcement
agent,
and
i
can't
say
that
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
best
our
country
is
able
to
produce.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
he
--
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
this
record
that
this
fbi
agent
was
unable
to
get
him
to
sign
the
form.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
he
handed
him
the
form
and
asked
him
what
he
signed.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
i
don't
think,
and
i
don't
--
in
fact,
i'm
certain
that
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
or
any
other
allegation
about
that
then.
mr.
braswell,
representing
the
respondent,
that
there
wasn't
any
pressure
put
on
the
respondent
butler.
after
he
handed
him
the
statement,
he
said
“i
won't
sign
it.”
and
to
say
that
the
fact
that
he
won't
sign
a
statement
determines
fully
and
completely
the
involuntariness
or
the
inadmissibility
per
se
of
anything
he
says
further
is
to
ignore
reality
or
how
he
raised
his
children
and
all
that
fruit
don't
put
your
name
upon
anything
(inaudible),
don't
sign
anything.
and
this
is
exactly
what
respondent
butler
did.
and
with
your
permission,
sir,
and
the
permission
of
the
chief
justice,
as
i
may
request
just
a
moment,
we
have
another
case
that's
pending
before
this
court
now
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief
where
an
fbi
agent
testified
with
respect
to
incriminating
statements
made,
again,
in
north
carolina.
the
fbi
agents
in
that
case
terminated
the
interview
as
soon
as
the
man
said
that
he
wanted
to
talk
to
his
mouth
piece.
that's
why
i
said
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and,
mr.
justice
marshall,
let
me
say
to
you
that
we
in
law
enforcement
have
no
problem
living
with
miranda.
miranda
is
good.
those
guidelines
are
good.
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
expand
them
and
to
read
into
something
that
this
court,
which
we
feel
has
not,
did
not
say
in
miranda.
i
submit
that
these
words
do
not
mean
that
a
suspect
is
required
to
execute
a
written
waiver
or
expressly
orally
waive
these
rights
guaranteed
by
miranda.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
stated
at
page
475
of
the
opinion,
“if
the
interrogation
continues
without
the
presence
of
an
attorney
and
a
statement
is
taken,
a
heavy
burden
rests
on
the
government
to
demonstrate
that
the
defendant
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
he's
rights
to
retain
opponent
counsel.
this
court
has
always
set
high
standards
of
proofs
for
the
waiver
of
constitutional
rights
and,
we
assert,
these
standards
is
applied
to
in-custody
interrogation.
the
position
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
and
we
assert,
that
is
just
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
stated
in
michigan
against
tucker,
the
court
said,
and
i'm
quoting,
“the
court
said
in
miranda
that
the
defendant
of
course
could
waive
these
rights,
but
that
any
waiver
must
have
been
made
voluntarily,
knowingly,
and
intelligently.”
we
would
ask
this
court
and
we
recognize
fully
that
this
court
is
not
bound
by
any
interpretation
of
any
circuit
court
throughout
the
united
states
but
each
one
of
the
circuits
have
interpreted
miranda,
as
was
done
in
united
states
against
montos,
a
fifth
circuit
case
where
cert
here
was
denied
and
the
opinion
expressed
there
was
an
expressed
statement
that
“the
individual
does
not
require
a
lawyer,”
is
not
required.
however,
to
show
that
an
individual
waived
his
right
to
have
one
present,
prosecution
must
show
that
he
was
effectively
advised
that
his
rights
have
been
effectively
waived.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
at
the
time
of
our
petition,
we
could
not
and
did
not
find
the
sixth
circuit.
we
were
relying
on
the
statement
of
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief,
amicus
curiae,
that
the
sixth
circuit
had
ruled
that
way.
that
is
my
reason
for
saying
unanimity.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
i
believe
that,
in
our
petition
for
cert
and
in
our
brief,
we
stated
that
there
were
20.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir,
they
are.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
before
miranda
was
announced
by
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
warren?
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
you
pardon
a
personal
observation,
i've
been
in
the
prosecution
business
for
25
years
and
i
am
not
past
let
any
--
(voice
overlap)
that
any
law
enforcement
agency
outside
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
as
i
say,
pre-miranda,
i
don't
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
that
contention
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
was
--
to
answer
his
question
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
the
fbi
had
the
policy
pre-miranda,
as
appears
on
page
483-486,
i
believe,
of
miranda.
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
i
--
mr.
lester
v.
chalmers,
jr.
i
cannot
take
exception
to
that,
sir.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
