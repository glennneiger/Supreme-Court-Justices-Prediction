mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

e.
burger
hadn't
you
just
told
us,
mr.
chalmers,
that
the
fbi
had
followed
this
practice
before
miranda?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
state
had
not
followed
it,
but
the
fbi
had
followed
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
braswell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
significance
that
you
attach
to
the
hour
of
the
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
does
that
--
what
--
that
doesn't
relate
to
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
as
it
might
at
2
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
that
sense,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
he
didn't
understand
what
was
printed
on
the
material
handed
to
him?
chief

warren
e.
burger
isn't

correct
that
he's
not
required

the

justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the--
chief

warren
e.

in
miranda
--
under
miranda,
is
there
any
requirement
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
my
original
question
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
north
carolina
thinks
about
it.
is
there
anything
in
miranda
in
the
opinion,
directly
or
indirectly,
which
says
that
a
person
must
sign
in
writing
in
order
to
waive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
all
my
question
is
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
saying
in
fact
that
refusal
to
sign
repudiates
any
kind
of
consent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
man
or
some
other
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
chalmers?
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
