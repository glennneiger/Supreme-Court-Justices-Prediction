justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
chalmers,
i
did
understand
you
to
be
arguing
that
the
rule
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
follows
deprives
the
suspect
of
the
opportunity
to
act
intelligently
in
his
own
way.
weren't
you
say
--
arguing
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
the
rule
that
north
carolina
court
follows
have
the
advantage
of
a
little
more
certainty
than
the
finder
of
fact
trying
to
interpret
ambiguous
conduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
would
be
wrong
with
that
to
be
darn
sure
about
what
he
intends
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure,
if
the
answer
is
yes,
the
issue
is
answered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
he
talks
before
he
gets
the
miranda
warnings
at
all.
it's
the
same
problem.
i
mean,
you
--
i
suppose
one
--
one
of
the
interest
hat
law
enforcement
people
have
here
is
to
have
a
clear-cut
rule
where
everybody
knows
when
the
questioning
can
commence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
know
you
can't
commence,
at
least
until
you
read
him
the
form.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
is
can
you
convince
--
can
you
commence
before
he
answers
unequivocally,
“i'm
prepared
to
talk.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say,
“yes,
well,
if
we
just
kind
of
leave
a
little
ambiguous,
we'll
take
our
chances
on
what
the
trial
judge
will
find.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
require
him
unequivocally
to
say
how
he
feels,
well
then,
isn't
it
--
don't
you
remove
one
issue
from
the
trials
that
follow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
the
very
reason
that
you
have
the
miranda
warning.
you
want
to
be
very
sure
that
the
man
is
prepared
to
confess
voluntarily
without
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
shouldn't
there
be
a
question
in
your
mind
when
he
says,
“no,
i
won't
sign
the
form”?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
really
don't
have
a
problem
if
he
signs
the
form,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
standard
practice
to
try
and
get
him
to
sign
the
form.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
did
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
one
side
of
the
conversation,
a
highly
sophisticated
law
enforcement
agent.
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
was
unable
to
get
him
to
sign
a
form
saying
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
asked
him
to,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
chalmers,
before
the
miranda
case
was
decided,
how
many
states
had
adopted
the
rule
of
the
miranda
case?
do
you
remember?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
point
is
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
pre-miranda,
neither
--
no
state
had
it
nor
any
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
now,
at
least
they've
got
north
carolina
on
this
rule.
so,
there's
more
support
for
the
rule
the
defendant
asked
for
here
in
the
other
courts
than
there
was
for
miranda
before
this
court
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
braswell
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
necessarily
in
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
braswell,
just
so
i
have
the
sequence
correct.
am
i
not
correct
in
recalling
that
the
oral
advice
of
miranda
rights
was
given
in
the
bronx
before
he
was
taken
to
the
fbi
office
some
seven
or
eight
miles
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
after
he
got
to
the
--
and
there
was
no
confession
after
the
oral
advise.
and
after
he
got
to
the
fbi
office,
he
was
handed
the
written
thing
to
read
to
himself
but
there
was
no
further
oral
statement
of
his
rights
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
top
of
825.
it's
somewhat
ambiguous
actually.
“we
advised
him
of
his
rights
and
i
have
a
card
that
i
carry
with
me
that
i
have
here.
the
card
reads
as
follows.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
he
should've
--
the
fbi
should've
stopped,
i
take
it,
what
you
mean
is
they
should've
either
given
him
orally
the
rights
or
some
of
the
substance
of
it
again
and
had
him
orally
say,
“well,
i'll
waive
orally
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
he
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
your
understanding
of
what
the
north
carolina
court
held?
they
didn't
hold
that
he
had
to
sign
in
writing.
they
held
that
he
had
either
to
make
it
unequivocally
clear
orally
or
in
writing.
