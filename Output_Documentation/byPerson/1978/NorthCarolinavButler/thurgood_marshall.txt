i
think
that
the
respondents
would
take
the
position
that
the
respondent
doesn't
mind
to
appraise
his
own
position
quietly
and
to
himself
but
not
before
public
office.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
without
help
from
the
prosecution.
why
put
all
the
weight
on
that
he
wants
to
sit
down
and
appraise
something,
the
respondent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
saying
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
under
detention
in
the
fbi
headquarters
and
he
thinks
out
loud.
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
i
misunderstood
you
to
say
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
saying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
the
fbi
regulation
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
its
agent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fbi
had
won.
it
was
put
in
the
record,
and
you
know
why
i
know
it
was
put
in
the
record?
i
put
it
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
in
the
same
time
the
miranda
case
was
argued,
the
united
states
against
jackson
was
argued
because
a
federal
case
and
the
one
the
two
chapters
were
on
referred
to
the
fbi
warning
regulation
was
put
in
the
jackson
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
had
been
used
by
the
fbi
for
many
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
many
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
braswell,
there
wasn't
any
signed
statement
involved
in
miranda,
was
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
do
you
put
all
this
on
the
signed
statement
and
put
it
on
miranda?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
only
point
is
why
the
answer
is
on
him
not
signing
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
ambiguous.
“i
don't
recall
if
i
read
it
orally
to
him
or
not.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
you
decide
to
find
if
the
agent
asked
him,
“do
you
waive
your
rights?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
--
that'd
be
alright?
