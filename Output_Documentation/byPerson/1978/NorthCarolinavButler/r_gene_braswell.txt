mr.
r.
gene
braswell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
explain
the
facts
and
elaborate
upon
those
a
little
differently
than
my
brother
did
in
stating
that
i
think
one
must
look
and
see
that,
at
the
time
of
6
o'clock
a.m.
that
morning,
seven
to
eight
from
the
fbi
arrived
at
the
residence
of
the
respondent.
he
was
awoken
by
a
loud
noise.
he
was
going
in
--
the
agents
went
inside
and
awaken
him
from
his
sleep,
took
him
out,
advised
him
orally
of
his
rights.
he
made
no
statement.
he
was
taken
down
to
the
new
rochelle
office.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
because
i
say
that
is
understandingly
intelligently
and
knowingly
waived
any
rights
that
he
may
have.
i
wanted
to
bring
that
to
the
court's
attention
that
within
one
hour
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
well,
i
think
it
does,
depending
upon
--
it
said
that
he
was
very
quiet.
it
took
a
lot
of
noise
to
get
him
aroused.
he
was
startled
at
the
time.
there
were
seven
agents.
they
were
prepared
to
go
to
any
extreme
and
indicated
by
office
martinez,
that
they
took
him
down
approximately
7:15
in
new
rochelle
office.
they
handed
him
a
form
and
asked
him
to
read
it.
whereupon,
i
contend
that
the
officer,
at
that
time,
assumed
that
this
man
had
the
intelligence
to
understand
that
he
could
read
it
simply
from
stating
that
he
had
an
11th
grade
education.
there's
no
guarantee
that
this
man
possess
the
intelligence
to
understand
what
he
read
at
that
time.
after
he
read
that,
he
stated,
“i
will
not
sign
it.
i
will
not
sign
anything.”
and
at
that
time,
the
officer
proceeded
to
say,
“it
is
not
mandatory
that
you
sign
the
form.
we
would
like
for
you
to
talk
to
us.”
the
respondent
contends
that,
at
that
time,
the
questioning
should've
stopped,
unless
when
the
officer
made
the
statements,
“well,
it's
not
mandatory
that
you
talk
to
us,
but
we
would
like
to
ask
you
some
questions.”
the
officer
should've
said
to
him
at
that
time,
“but
if
you
answer
those
questions,
those
rights
that
are
in
that
written
paper
that
you
just
had
in
your
hand
will
still
apply,”
because,
as
stated,
i
believe,
that
the
man
at
that
time
felt,
as
he
was
there,
as
my
brother
said,
paper,
to
me,
it
attaches
a
different
significance
and
that
the
paper
writing
was
something
permanent.
and
that
he
was
being
offered
something
to
sign
and
say,
“i
give
up
these
rights.”
he
refused
to
do
it.
he
refused
to
take
that
step,
and
i
believe
our
court
--
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
is
in
standing
with
what
miranda
decision
meant
and
what
it
implies,
that
that
time,
if
in
any
manner,
a
suspect
in
any
manner
allows
or
instigates
or
makes
a
statement
to
say
that
he,
at
that
time,
intends
to
exercise
his
rights,
then
there's
a
duty
for
the
fbi
man
to
stop
and
not
go
any
further.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
that
--
to
remain
silent,
not
make
any
statement,
or
that
he
wants
a
counsel,
or,
words
of
that
time,
he
states
or
he
makes
a
statement,
“i'm
not
going
to
sign
anything.i
will
not
sign
the
form.”
but
at
that
time,
martinez
should've
stopped.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir,
there
was
not,
justice
marshall.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
think
the
interrogator
set
the
tone
of
the
interrogation.
he
orally
advised
the
man
of
his
rights
and
the
man
made
no
statements.
he
then
came
in
and
he
places
a
written
statement
before
him
and
says
“read
this.”
he,
at
that
time,
set
the
tone
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
about
giving
this
man
his
rights.
if
he
intended
to
give
his
rights
to
him,
i
contend
and
respondent
--
in
behalf
of
the
respondent,
that
he
should've
read
them
to
him.
that
he
should've
said
that.
he
should
not
assume
that
the
man
could've
read
them
and
understood
them.
he
should
have
gotten
that
specific
waiver
that
justice
stevens
is
talking
about.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
because
that's
what
the
officer
gave
to
him,
justice
marshall.
i
feel,
at
that
time
when
he
gave
him
that,
he
at
that
time
placed
himself,
the
agent
that
is,
placed
himself
in
this
man's
mind
of
saying,
“here
is
something
that
you
must
sign
if
you
want
to
waive
your
rights,”
and
the
man
refused
to
sign
it.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
say
the
record
is
silent
from
that,
sir.
he
--
i'm
saying
that
the
court
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
right,
he
nodded
his
head,
sir.
in
our
state,
this
year,
we
gave
an
11th
grade
competency
test
where
approximately
25%
of
the
people
fan
--
failed
which,
i
think,
shows
that
a
person
may
be
ashamed,
he
may
be
reluctant
to
admit
that
he
can't
read
and
right
and
understand
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
grant
you
that,
sir,
but
at
--
i'm
saying
that
at
this
particular
case
that
this
man
here
did
not
ever
acknowledged
that
he
understood
everything
about
it,
except
to
say,
“i
will
not
sign
anything.”
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
sir,
earlier,
and
he
exercised
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir.
he
exercised
those
at
that
time
and
he
exercised
them
again
with
the
written
waiver.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
he
exercised
his
right
to
remain
silent.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
he
did
not
talk
after
the
oral
advisory.
he
did
not
talk
after
the
offer
of
the
paper.
he
said,
“i
will
not
sign,”
and
he
did
not
make
any
statement
until
the
officer
said
to
him,
“it
is
not
mandatory
that
you
sign
the
form,
but
we
would
like
for
you
to
talk
to
us”
which,
as
indicated
here,
the
man
is
a
highly
trained
person.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
think
you
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir.
i
say
that
he's
--
he
is
not
required.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
sir?
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
north
carolina
has
now,
what
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
expressed
waiver.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
either
orally
or
written,
not
necessarily
written
but
one
of
the
other.
in
other
words,
given
a
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i've
cited
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir,
there
is
nothing.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
nothing.
in
the
u.s.
brief
filed
as
amicus
curiae
by
the
solicitor
general,
they
indicate,
and
i
state
that
if
it
had
happened
as
they
indicate
in
their
brief
we
will
not
be
here,
that
is
they
indicate
that
after
the
reading
of
the
form
by
my
client
at
that
time
that
the
agent
advised
him
that,
“if
you
do
decide
to
talk,
then
you
still
have
the
same
rights
and
if
you
want
an
attorney,
one
will
be
appointed
for
you
if
you
can't
afford
one.”
if
they
had
said
that
and
he
went
ahead
and
made
those
statements,
i'd
say
there'd
be
no
need
for
us
being
here
today,
here
in
this
case,
but
he
did
not
say
that.
he
said,
“i'm
not
going
to
sign
anything.”
again,
martinez
said
to
him
“it's
not
mandatory
that
you
sign,
but
we
would
like
to
ask
you
some
questions,”
whereupon,
he
said,
“well,
i'm
not
going
to
sign
anything.
i'll
talk
to
you.”
at
that
time,
martinez
--
and
i
refer
to
the
fdr
395,
the
fbi
form
which
sets
out
the
guidelines
that
one
goes
through
if
one
encounters
that,
and
i
say
that
was
not
followed
by
the
agent.
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
wrote
in
the
form
that
the
man
refused
to
sign
but
said
he
would
talk
to
us.
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
my
client,
the
respondent,
ever
had
an
opportunity
to
read,
to
see,
to
have
it
read
back
to
him
what
allegedly
he
said
which,
i
say,
goes
to
one
of
the
tests
that
has
been
implied
later,
of
trustworthiness,
by
justice
rehnquist
which
said
that
if
you
look
at
it
overall
and
that
the
statement
is
trustworthy,
you
go
to
that.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir.
they
specifically
--
they
said
there
must
be
a
specific
waiver.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir.
i
am
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
he
was
arrested
and
then
he
was
transported.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
well
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir.
i
agree,
that's
what
the
case
says,
but
the
statement
of
the
case
by
the
petitioner
and
the
appendix
in
the
record
itself
says,
and
in
the
case,
the
only
thing
that
has
ever
hap
--
or
ever
happened
at
that
time
was
that
he
was
given
the
form
to
read.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
okay,
so
page
85,
starting
with
the
first
paragraph,
“during
the
trip
and
i
gave
him
a
prov
--
his
advice
of
rights
form
in
the
room.”
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
alright,
sir.
i
read,
“during
the
trip,
he
was
very
quiet
and
he
seem
to
accept
the
fact
that
we'd
arrested
him
and
he
offered
no
resistance.
he
knew
who
we
were
and
i
think
he
knew
what
was
going
on.
at
the
office
space,
special
agent
ben
and
i
took
butler
up
to
an
interview
room
and
gave
him
the
rights
--
advice
of
rights
form
which
he
read.
there
were
not
any
paper
served
on
him
at
that
time.”
skipping
out,
“i
gave
him
the
advice
of
rights
form
in
the
room
and
i
observed
whether
or
not
he
could
read
it.
i
read
it
and
i
don't
recall
if
i
read
it
orally
to
him.”
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
sir?
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
disagree
in
as
much
as
if
it
says
that
he
was
given
them
orally
back
in
new
rochelle
office.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
right.
in
that
there
appears
to
be,
again,
an
oversight
of
the
statement
and
i
feel
that
the
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
an
oversight
at
the
time
that
the
court
read
that
that
we
all
took
it
from
that
as
mr.
justice
stewart
did
at
that
time,
sir.
but
in
looking
back
through
the
case
and
looking
through
the
evidence
in
all,
find
that
officer
martinez
was
very
--
could
not
be
very
exact
in
--
as
to
reading
the
rights
or
whether
or
not
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir,
i
did
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
again,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
appears
that
he
indicated
by
nodding
his
head
and
that
he
said
he
did.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
right.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
not
as
this
case
relates,
no,
sir.
i
do
question
as
it
having,
in
reality,
occurred.
but
based
on
the
narrow
question
as
i
see
this,
i
did
not
question
it,
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
think
it
does,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
because
he
said,
“i
will
not
sign
anything.
i
will
not
sign
the
form.”
and
at
that
time,
the
agent
said,
“it
is
not
mandatory
that
you
sign,
but
we
would
like
to
ask
you
some
questions,”
and
i
think
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
believe
it
would
have,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
well,
on
the
occasion
when
he
was
orally
advised
of
his
rights,
he
made
no
statement.
if
three
or
four
minutes
occurred,
a
lapse
of
three
or
four
minutes
occurred
after
the
reading
of
this
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
right.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
they
could
give
him
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
that
is
what
he
indicated,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
well,
i'm
saying
that
is
the
agent's
assumption
of
what
he
said.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
no,
sir,
i
do
not
disagree
that
he
was
orally
given
them,
that
he
was
writtenly
given
at
the
station.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
would
disagree
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
he
understood
them,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
“i
will
talk
to
you?”
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
will
--
i
accept
that
he
said
that
after
the
agent
made
the
statement
to
him,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
“it
is
not
mandatory.”
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
right.
that
after
the
agent
says,
“it's
not
mandatory
for
you
to
sign
the
form,
but
we
would
like
for
you
to
talk
to
us.”
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
he
said,
“i
will
talk
to
you,
but
i
won't
sign
anything.”
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
right.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i'm
saying
it
should've
stopped
right
there.
i
think
it
should've
gone
--
should
not
have
gone
any
further.
i
think
that
is
mostly
akin
to
the
--
with
the
exception
of
time
limit
there
of
what
browster
states
in
--
where
the
man
has
gotten
on
the
train
and
he's
riding
on
the
train
going
to
where
his
other
lawyer
is.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
if
he
--
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
if
he
had
have
said
to
him
and
he
had
got
an
oral
answer,
“yes,
sir,”
if
he
had
said
“do
you
waive
these
rights?”
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
that's
a
very
good
point,
justice
stewart.
quite
cannily,
a
lot
of
times
when
a
person
is
on
the
stand
and
you
use
a
simple
word
“prior”
he
doesn't
understand
what
you
mean
when
you
mean
“before.”
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
can't
say
for
this
man,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
i
believe
it
does,
if
i
understand
--
if
i
recall
from
record
28,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
they
should've
either
stopped
or
they
should've
said
at
that
time
that
“we
would
like
to
talk
to
you.”
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
“but
it's
not
mandatory
for
you
to
sign
this
form
but
that
if
you
talk
to
us,
the
same
rights
will
apply.”
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir,
an
explicit
waiver.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
right.
we
could
not
leave
it
up
to
the
officer
to
assume.
mr.
r.
gene
braswell
yes,
sir.
any
further
questions?
thank
you,
gentlemen.
