justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
the
test
of
miranda,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
test
under
miranda
is
not
whether
the
free
will
of
the
witness
was
overborne
but,
rather,
whether
the
miranda
warnings
were
given
and
that's
it.
justice
potter
stewart
miranda
is
not
a
voluntariness
test.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
it
that
--
what
miranda
said
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
this
court
has
done
in
every
case
that
has
followed
miranda?
justice
potter
stewart
without
help
from
the
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
chalmers,
you've
said
--
you
repeated
what
you
said
earlier
that
each
one
of
the
federal
circuits
has
expressed
disagreement
with
north
carolina's
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
of
your
petition,
i
think
it
was
10
of
the
11
circuits.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
and
then,
at
the
time
of
your
petition,
i
think
you
said
16
states,
and
now
you,
today,
told
us
20
states.
justice
potter
stewart
20?
justice
potter
stewart
and
are
they
identified
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
thank
you.
that's
all
i
needed.
justice
potter
stewart
exercise
what
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
does
show
that
he
said
he
had
an
11th
grade
education.
justice
potter
stewart
normally,
there's
a
presumption
that
somebody
who's
gone
through
11
years
of
schooling
knows
how
to
read
and
right.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
the
record
also
indicate
that
he
was
orally
advised
of
his
rights
under
the
miranda
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there's
no
indication
that
he
was
deaf,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
he
exercised
what?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
he
talked.
he
said
“i'll
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
expressed
his
willingness
to
talk
and
then
he
talked.
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
north
carolina.
justice
potter
stewart
north
carolina
has
held
that
there
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
this
case.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
read
miranda
to
require
an
explicit
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
explicit,
never
implicit.
justice
potter
stewart
right
and,
mr.
braswell,
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
which
decided
this
case
in
your
favor
seems
to
be
inconsistent
in
its
statement
of
the
facts
with
the
answer
you
just
gave
to
my
brother
stevens.
it
says
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
page,
on
page
83
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
says
when
he
was
arrested
in
new
york
at
1225
chardon
avenue
in
brooklyn,
he
was
immediately
and
fully
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
transported
to
the
new
rochelle
office
where
he
was
again
advised
of
his
rights.
defendant,
who
had
an
11th
grade
education,
then
took
the
advice
of
rights
form
and
read
it
himself.
now,
you
said
that,
just
in
answer
to
justice
stevens,
that
all
that
was
done
at
the
new
rochelle
office
was
to
give
him
the
right
--
the
advice
of
rights
form
and
let
him
read
it
himself.
that's
not
what
this
opinion
says.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
he
was
arrested
and
advised
of
his
miranda
rights.
he
was
then
transported
to
new
rochelle
and
again
advised
of
his
miranda
rights,
and
then
was
given
the
form
to
read.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
said.
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
show
me
the
--
where
in
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
no
question
that
he
did
give
him
the
advice
of
rights
form.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
that
he
orally
advised
him
before
that.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
statement
in
the
opinion
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
you
think,
is
erroneous.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
there
any
controversy
about
whether
or
not
your
client
was
asked
if
he
understood
his
rights
after
reading
the
form
and
his
reply
that
he
did?
justice
potter
stewart
again,
i'm
just
reading
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
north
carolina.
justice
potter
stewart
which,
as
i
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
decided
in
your
favor.
you're
questioning
that
statement
of
fact
also?
justice
potter
stewart
he
understood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
--
is
there
any
controversy
over
the
fact
that
he
said,
“i
will
talk
to
you”?
justice
potter
stewart
you
accept
that
as
one
of
the
findings?
justice
potter
stewart
and
after
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
after
--
and
after
at
least
one
oral
and
one
written
statement
--
justice
potter
stewart
advise
of
his
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he
said,
“i
will
talk
to
you.”
justice
potter
stewart
“i'm
not
signing
any
form.”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
probably,
with
today's
education
as
you
explain
it
to
us,
he
wouldn't
know
what
the
word
“waive”
meant.
justice
potter
stewart
there
had
to
be
an
explicit
waiver
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
if
he
wants
to
get
or
find
the
waiver
from
circumstantial
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
also
have
another
announcement
this
morning
that
i'm
authorized
to
make
on
behalf
of
the
court.
this
is
the
case
of
north
carolina
against
butler
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
in
conflict
with
the
view
of
every
other
court
that
has
considered
the
issue,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
has
held
in
this
case
that
under
this
court’s
decision
in
miranda
against
arizona,
no
statement
of
a
person
under
custodial
interrogation
may
be
admitted
in
evidence
against
him
unless
at
the
time
the
statement
was
made,
he
explicitly
waived
the
right
to
the
presence
of
a
lawyer.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
this
per
se
rule
reflects
a
proper
understanding
of
the
miranda
decision.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
an
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
the
judgment
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
north
carolina
supreme
court
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
blackmun
while
joining
the
court
opinion
has
filed
a
concurring
statement.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
joined.
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
