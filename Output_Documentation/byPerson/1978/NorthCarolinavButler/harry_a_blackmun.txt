do
you
feel
the
north
carolina
rule
is
rather
isolated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
feel
the
rule
enunciated
by
your
supreme
court
is
rather
isolated
among
other
courts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
do
you
think
your
court
takes
that
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
they're
throwing
the
ball
of
miranda
back
here?
or
is
that
what
they're
doing
or
what?
i'll
withdraw
that
question.

mr.
braswell.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
be
sure
as
to
what
you're
saying.
do
you
disagree
with
a
statement
that
he
was
given
the
miranda
warnings
by
agent
martinez
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
and
again
back
at
the
agent's
office?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
the
--
what
i've
just
read
is
from
the
petitioner's
brief
and,
in
your
brief,
you
say
that
you
rely
on
the
statement
of
the
case
as
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
with
one
exception
which
is
not
relevant
to
what
i'm
asking.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
how
old
he
was?
