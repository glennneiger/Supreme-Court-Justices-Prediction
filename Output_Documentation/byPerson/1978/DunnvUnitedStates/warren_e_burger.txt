chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
dunn
against
the
united
states.
mr.
sears,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
if
you
don't
mind
the
absence
of
an
audience.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
he
reaffirmed
the
affidavit,
will
you
enlarge
on
that,
he
was
under
oath
before
a
grand
jury
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
district
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
he
simply
say
he
reaffirmed
it
in
a
conclusory
way
or
did
he
restate
the
same
facts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
--
when
you
say
90%
false,
that
was
directed
at
what?
at
the
original
grand
jury
testimony
or
at
the
affidavit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
--
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue,
mr.
sears.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
read
that
the
government
need
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
rather
broad
statement
necessary
to
the
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
necessary
in
portash?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
--
would
that
apply
to
a
crime
and
not
yet
committed,
acts
not
yet
a
committed,
acts
not
yet
committed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
would
a
pretrial
deposition
fit
in
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
it's
functionally
equivalent
to
use
that
phrase
over
deposition,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
no
hostility
between
the
person
who
signed
the
affidavit
and
the
person
who
presumably
prepared
it
here,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
at
that
time,
it
was
prepared
and
signed
they
all
thought
they
were
on
the
same
high
road
presumably?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
helped
mr.
musgrave
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
sense
that
you
suggested
as
an
affidavit
on
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
even
in
the
trial
courts,
the
privilege
is
not
absolute
to
justify
its
assertion,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
can
be
an
inquiry
by
the
court
to
determine
whether
it's
a
validly
assertion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
really
suggesting
that
the
agreement
on
the
immunity
should
be
ignored
for
failure
of
consideration
in
effect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
sears?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
government
got
what
it
bargained
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he's
still
claiming
all
the
benefits
of
that
bargain,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
any
adjustment
in
the
price?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
