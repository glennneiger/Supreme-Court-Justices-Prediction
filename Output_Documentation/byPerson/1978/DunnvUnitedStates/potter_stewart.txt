justice

stewart
and
the
government
agrees
with
you
on
that
here
and
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
because
you
concede
that
if
the
prosecution
had
been
for
perjury
before
the
grand
jury
in
his
immunized
testimony
that
would
have
been
valid.
justice
potter
stewart
and
which
you
accept?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
concede
that
the
--
that
unless
the
what
--
the
transaction
in
the
lawyer's
office
was
ran
by
the
statute
and
this
conviction
cannot
stand.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
petitioner
concedes
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
know.
this
was
an
affidavit
prepared
by
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
affidavit
had
---
this
was
filed
in
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
affidavit
itself
was
filed
and
was
the
basis
for
the
motion,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
on
which
there
was
a
hearing.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
incident
was
quite
similar
to
an
affidavit
filed
in
support
or
an
opposition
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
knowing
they've
given
for
that
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
that
the
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
whether
it's
desirable
or
wise
or
even
proper?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
privilege
of
course
was
not
to
testify
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
agree
that
that's
what
the
privilege,
that
would
be
consequence
of
the
exercise
or
the
privilege,
would
be
not
to
testify
at
all.
