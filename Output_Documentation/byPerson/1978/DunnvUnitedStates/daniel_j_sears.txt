mr.
daniel
j.
sears
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
before
the
court
today
to
present
three
primary
questions:
whether
a
sworn
statement
taken
in
a
private
attorneys
office
may
be
deemed
a
proceeding
ancillary
to
u.s.
court
or
grand
jury
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
section
1623?
can
immunized
testimony
be
used
against
the
witness
to
establish
the
corpus
delicti
of
an
inconsistent
declarations
prosecution
without
proof
that
the
witness
testified
falsely
under
immunity?
and
did
the
appellate
court
in
this
case
adopt
a
proper
theory
in
sustaining
the
conviction
of
mr.
dunn?
your
honor,
petitioner
submits
that
all
three
issues
must
be
resolved
against
him
before
the
conviction
can
stand.
the
underlying
case
proceeded
as
follows.
mr.
dunn
appeared
before
federal
grand
jury
in
denver,
colorado
on
june
16,
1976.
he
claimed
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
subsequently
was
ordered
to
appear
before
united
states
district
judge
whereupon
he
was
granted
use
immunity
under
18
united
states
code
section
6002.
he
thereafter
reappeared
and
testified
the
certain
drug
activities
at
the
colorado
state
penitentiary
implicating
one
phillip
musgrave
and
several
other
co-defendants.
as
a
result,
an
indictment
was
returned
against
musgrave
and
three
other
co-defendants.
on
september
30,
1976,
he
appeared
in
the
office
of
musgrave's
attorney,
michael
canges
and
proceeded
to
recant
his
grand
jury
testimony.
present
was
a
notary
public
who
administered
the
oath
and
recorded
mr.
dunn's
statement
by
virtue
of
a
tape-recording.
it
was
subsequently
reduced
to
writing
and
tendered
to
the
u.s.district
court
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
although
the
record
is
silent
as
to
this,
i
believe
the
evidence
would
indicate
that
mr.
dunn
met
mr.
musgrave
and
then
proceeded
to
strike
a
deal
with
him.
subsequently,
wound
up
in
his
attorney's
office,
mr.
musgrave's
attorney's
office
and
recanted
what
he
had
told
to
--
what
he
had
told
to
the
grand
jury.
the
statement
was
reduced
to
writing
and
tendered
to
the
court
as
an
exhibit
in
support
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
against
musgrave.
on
october
21,
1976,
a
hearing
on
that
motion
was
held
in
the
united
states
district
court.
dunn
was
called
as
a
witness
and
once
again
reaffirmed
the
affidavit
even
though
he'd
indicated
he
had
not
totally
reviewed
it.
the
charges
against
musgrave
were
subsequently
reduced.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
he
was
under
oath
before
u.s.
district
judge,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
yes.
your
honor
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
believe
the
nature
of
the
testimony
went
that
he
was
asked
to
identify
the
affidavit,
did
identify
it.
asked
him
if
it
was
the
truth?
he
said,
yes,
it
was.
and
he
says,
is
it
all
the
truth?
then
he
said,
possibly
10%.
each
declaration
that
he
made
before
the
grand
jury
was
not
proceeded
through
and
it
was
the
conclusory
remark
that
90%
of
it
was
false
which
we
may
infer.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
no,
your
honor.
it
was
directed
at
the
original
grand
jury
testimony.
now,
that's
one
of
our
basic
contentions
in
this
case.
the
october
21st
proceeding
in
u.s.
district
court
was
not
alleged
to
be
an
ancillary
proceeding
in
this
inconsistent
declarations
prosecution.
and
even
though
the
appellate
court
affirmed
the
conviction
by
looking
to
that
proceeding
and
indicating
that
dunn
by
adopting
that
statement
had
somehow
turned
the
september
30th
proceeding
into
an
ancillary
proceeding,
we
submit
that
was
outside
the
indictment
and
improper
amendment
or
prejudicial
variance
from
the
indictment.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
it
prejudiced
in
our
preparation
for
the
case
and
that
we
were
preparing
to
go
to
trial
contesting
the
ancillariness
of
the
september
30th
proceeding
rather
than
the
october
21st
proceeding.
the
october
21st
proceeding
was
not
mentioned
in
the
indictment
whatsoever.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
pardon?
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
we
did
know
it
had
taken
place,
your
honor,
and
--
but
as
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
conceded
prior
to
the
introduction
of
that
transcript
and
as
we
indicated
to
the
court,
we
have
not
been
provided
with
the
copy
of
that
transcript
under
rule
16
and
the
government
attorney
conceded
that
he
did
not
contemplate
it
as
evidence
in
the
case
in
chief.
there
was
no
mention
of
the
october
21st
proceeding
in
the
indictment
whatsoever.
we're
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
we
were
prejudiced
on
the
basis
that
our
defense
had
been
prepared
to
challenge
the
ancillariness
of
the
september
30th
proceeding
and
not
the
october
21st.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
the
only
way
i
can
respond
to
his
honor's
question
is
that
we
did
not
have
sufficient
notice
to
prepare
a
theory
in
that
regard
and
we
were
not
--
we
were
not
expecting
that
we're
going
to
have
to
meet
that
evidence
as
a
basis
for
an
ancillary
proceeding
as
the
court
subsequently
ruled.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
quite
candidly,
your
honor,
yes.
your
honor,
as
a
result
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
i
don't
challenge
that
in
the
least
regard.
the
only
thing
i
would
question,
your
honor,
is
whether
that
proceeding
--
whether
a
prosecution
could
be
made
out
of
that
proceeding
as
well
based
upon
our
same
objection
that
the
immunized
testimony
could
not
be
used.
but
yes,
it
was
a
proceeding
before
the
court
under
1623.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
yes
and
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
i
believe
that
was
part
of
our
argument.
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
on
december
15,
1976,
dunn
was
subsequently
indicted
on
five
counts
of
false
declarations
before
a
grand
jury
in
violation
of
section
1623.
paragraph
1
of
each
count
alleged
that
dunn
had
made
false
declarations
before
the
grand
jury
on
june
16,
1976.
and
in
paragraph
4
of
each
respective
count
set
out
specific
declarations
relied
upon.
paragraph
5
of
each
count
charged
dunn
knowingly
made
declarations
on
september
30,
1976.
and
then
the
sixth
paragraph
indicated
that
the
declarations
that
have
been
made
in
september
30th
proceeding
in
canges'
office
and
the
june
16th
proceeding
were
inconsistent
to
the
degree
that
one
of
them
was
necessarily
false.
due
to
the
confusion
from
the
first
paragraph,
the
charge
that
he
had
testified
falsely
before
the
grand
jury
on
june
16th
and
the
fourth
and
fifth
paragraphs
had
indicated
that
he
had
testified
falsely
in
the
september
30th
proceeding.
defense
moved
for
a
bill
of
particulars
to
seek
out
the
government
theory
in
which
they
relied
to
prove
this
case
whether
they
were
intending
to
use
the
september
30th
statement
as
an
admission
that
as
declarations
before
the
grand
jury
were
false
or
conversely
whether
they
were
relying
on
the
subsection
(c)
theory
of
inconsistent
declarations.
in
other
words,
submitting
that
the
declaration
were
so
inherently
inconsistent
that
one
of
them
have
to
be
false.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
no,
it
doesn't
have
to
state
the
legal
theory,
your
honor,
in
so
far
as
it
need
not
further
explain
the
indictment
of
the
defense
which
the
defense
must
meet.
my
understanding
of
the
bill
of
particulars
has
always
been
twofold.
the
more
adequately
explain
the
charge
and
to
protect
against
double
jeopardy
claim
so
that
by
considering
the
charge
in
the
record,
similar
charge
could
not
be
made.
and
i
would
submit
that's
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case
by
looking
not
only
the
september
30th
but
october
21st
for
ancillariness.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
pardon?
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
yes,
we
did.
yet,
not
in
the
way
of
a
form
of
bill
of
particulars
but
the
government
did
respond
that
it
was
going
to
rely
on
the
1623
(c)
inconsistent
declarations
theory.
and
that
theory
was
submitted
throughout
the
course
of
the
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
that
is
correct
and
the
court
so
instructed
the
jury
that
the
government
need
not
prove
which
of
the
declarations
was
false.
at
trial,
the
september
30th
transcription
have
dunn
statement
which
i'll
refer
to
as
the
canges'
statement
was
introduced
to
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
who
testified
that
he
have
received
as
an
exhibit
on
october
12,
1976
in
the
musgrave
case.
on
cross-examination,
the
clerk
was
asked
to
identify
the
immunity
order
and
application
identify
his
defendant's
exhibit
f-1
and
f-2
entered
prior
to
dunn's
appearance
and
testimony
before
the
grand
jury.
the
notary
republic
was
then
called
to
the
stand
and
asked
to
identify
the
september
30th
kansas
statement
which
had
been
rendered
on
september
30,
1976.
he
indicated
however
on
cross-examination
that
dunn
did
not
have
counsel
of
his
own
choosing
in
the
office
of
musgrave's
attorney.
he
was
not
familiar
with
the
criminal
deposition
procedures
under
18
u.s.c.
section
3503,
no
court
order
had
been
obtained
for
the
taking
of
this
disposition,
and
there
was
no
indication
that
dunn
would
be
unavailable
for
trial
which
we
submit
are
necessary
requirements
for
this
document
to
qualify
as
deposition
under
3503.
upon
the
government's
office,
the
kansas
statement,
the
defense
objected,
it
did
not
qualify
his
proceedings
ancillary
or
before
a
u.s.
court
of
grand
jury.
the
government
next
introduced
dunn's
grand
jury
testimony
through
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
conducted
the
musgrave
grand
jury
investigation.
on
cross-examination,
however,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
admitted
that
there
was
no
independent
evidence
but
for
dunn's
recantations
of
september
30th
and
october
21st
to
disbelieve
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
that
there
was
much
evidence
to
corroborate
the
truth
of
it.
the
defense
objected
to
the
use
of
the
grand
jury's
testimony
on
the
basis
that
was
in
violation
of
his
immunity
order.
both
of
those
objections
were
overruled
and
both
exhibits
were
admitted
into
evidence.
then
the
government
further
offered
the
transcript
of
the
october
21,
1976
evidentiary
hearing
in
u.s.
district
court.
the
defense
objected
that
these
declarations
were
not
outlined
in
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
that
it
was
beyond
the
proper
scope
of
the
indictment.
the
government
did
concede
that
prior
to
trial
this
evidence
had
not
been
submitted
to
the
defense
and
was
not
intended
as
evidence
in
the
case
in
chief.
his
response
was
since
we
have
cross-examined
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
as
to
the
truthfulness
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
he
wanted
to
offset
that
testimony
by
use
of
the
subsequent
reaffirmation
to
lend
credence
to
the
september
30th
statement.
the
government
rested
then
elected
not
to
testify.
defense
then
move
for
judgment
of
acquittal
on
two
bases
that
the
immunized
grand
jury
testimony
could
not
be
used
against
him
to
establish
the
corpus
delicti
and
in
inconsistent
declaration
prosecution
and
that
the
canges'
statement
was
not
an
ancillary
proceeding
under
section
1623.
the
trial
court
ruled
that
the
canges'
statement
if
not
originally
ancillary
“channels
its
way
into
being
an
ancillary
proceeding”
upon
the
confirmation
in
u.s.
district
court
on
october
21st.
however,
united
states
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
dunn's
position
and
said
that
the
september
30th
statement
was
not
ancillary
proceeding
as
the
statute
requires.
the
court
however
found
that
the
october
21st
proceeding
was
ancillary
and
affirmed
the
conviction
on
that
basis
even
though
that
proceeding
had
not
been
set
out
in
the
indictment.
the
court
found
“it
was
a
proceeding
ancillary
to
the
grand
jury
because
of
dunn's
subsequent
affirmation
and
adoption
of
the
earlier
statement
on
october
21st.
in
other
words,
look
to
the
october
21st
proceeding
as
an
affirmation
of
the
earlier
september
30th
proceeding.
the
court
held
that
its
admission,
the
october
21st
statement
into
evidence
was
not
a
prejudicial
variance
because
the
defense
would
have
contemplated.
now,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
--
since
the
indictment
charge
the
june
16th
and
the
september
30th
statements
as
being
proceedings
either
before
or
ancillary
to
u.s.
court
or
grand
jury.
it
set
out
the
declarations
in
each
of
those
two
proceedings
which
were
alleged
to
be
consistent.
the
only
question
for
the
jury
was
where
the
declarations
in
those
two
separate
proceedings
so
inherently
inconsistent
that
one
of
them
had
to
be
false.
we
submit
that
the
october
21st
proceeding
had
no
proper
purpose
in
this
hearing.
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
it
could
have
all
set
any
contention
that
the
statements
were
a
matter
of
mistake
or
inadvertence.
we
submit
that
the
only
issue
to
the
jury
was
whether
the
separate
--
separately
alleged
declarations
in
the
two
separate
proceedings
charged
in
the
indictment
were
so
inherently
inconsistent
under
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
submit
due
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
proof
under
section
1623
(c)
theory
that
is
only
the
declarations
that
are
specifically
set
out
in
the
two
proceedings
that
can
be
at
issue
before
either
the
trial
court
or
jury.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
yes
and
i
would
submit
that
the
only
question
of
prejudice
would
come
if
the
october
--
if
we
were
considering
whether
the
october
21st
admissions
were
improperly
introduced
into
evidence.
other
than
that
we
would
submit
they
had
no
proper
bearing
on
the
case
and
that
whether
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honor,
if
i
might
address
further
response
to
his
honor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
questions
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
defendant
dunn
was
prejudiced
by
the
government's
action
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
that
if
the
court
finds
a
constructive
amendment
to
the
indictment
in
this
case
under
the
reasoning
of
stirone
versus
united
states
prejudiced
need
not
be
found.
however,
if
the
court
feels
that
the
proceedings
in
which
the
government
introduced
evidence
against
mr.
dunn
particularly
the
october
21st
proceedings
were
merely
a
variance
in
pleading
and
proof,
then
we
submit
that
prejudice
would
have
to
be
found
under
that
reasoning.
your
honor,
with
regard
to
this
stirone
case
i
would
submit
that
the
prejudice
against
dunn
may
be
more
grievous
than
mr.
stirone
realized
in
--
under
the
facts
underlying
that
case,
the
court
recall
in
stirone
that
the
defendant
was
charged
the
hobbs
act
violation.
and
the
specific
allegation
in
the
indictment
was
the
interstate
commerce
of
particular
portion
of
the
allegation
which
concern
shipping
sand
into
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
construct
a
steel
plant.
however,
trial
the
government
instead
prove
that
steel
was
going
to
be
shipped
out
of
pennsylvania
and
that
was
the
interstate
element
of
the
jury
you
should
look
to.
and
this
honorable
court
in
that
particular
proceeding
found
that
while
there
was
a
variance
in
the
sense
of
the
variation
between
pleading
and
proof.
the
variation
here
destroyed
the
defendant's
substantial
right
to
be
tried
only
on
those
charges
presented
in
an
indictment
returned
by
a
grand
jury.
for
further
stated
deprivation
of
such
a
basic
right
is
far
too
serious
to
be
treated
as
nothing
more
than
a
variance
and
then
dismiss
this
harmless
error.
i
would
submit
the
stirone
case
has
been
properly
referred
to
as
constructive
amendment
even
though
i
would
interpret
the
court's
language
to
proceed
on
a
prejudicial
variance
basis.
your
honor,
the
tenth
circuit
also
determined
aside
from
the
ancillary
issue
that
dunn
has
immunized
testimony
could
be
used
against
him
in
an
inconsistent
declarations
prosecution
because
his
subsequent
affirmation
first
of
all
is
recantation
in
the
september
30th
proceeding
in
the
subsequent
affirmation
in
the
october
20th
proceeding
contained
the
admission
by
him
that
his
grand
jury
testimony
was
false
and
it
was
due
to
this
possible
conclusion
that
the
defense
on
cross-examination
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
at
trial
established
that
there
was
independent
evidence
to
believe
the
truthfulness
of
the
grand
jury
testimony.
even
though
dunn
had
subsequently
recanted
and
that
there
was
reasonably
the
subsequent
recantations
may
in
fact
been
false.
however,
the
theory
throughout
this
case
was
inconsistent
declarations
and
the
government
never
attempted
to
prove
that
his
grand
jury
testimony
was
false
under
the
1623
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
we
would
submit
they
would
need
to
in
order
to
get
around
the
protection
that
dunn
was
afforded
by
the
immunity
order.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
your
honor
the
argument
in
the
brief
may
be
somewhat
unclear.
we
do
not
contend
the
false
declarations
under
1623
as
not
an
exception
to
6002.
we
do
argue,
however,
that
the
inconsistent
declarations
method
of
proof
is
precluded
when
part
of
the
declarations
relied
upon
are
under
an
ordered
immunity
under
6002.
and
the
government's
method
of
proof
inconsistent
declarations
in
this
case
without
proving
that
dunn
had
violated
his
immunity
order
was
accepted
from
use
by
the
government.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
don't
recall
the
specific
holding
in
the
bane
case.
but
as
i
recall,
that
case
stood
for
the
proposition
that
--
well,
i
have
to
confess
i
just
don't
recall
the
holding
of
bane.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention,
however,
to
this
honorable
court's
holdings
in
kastigar
and
murphy
which
i
think
are
quite
crucial
to
the
consideration
of
the
issues
here
and
more
recently
in
new
jersey
versus
portash
which
was
decided
march
20th
and
that's
that
an
individuals
immunized
testimony
cannot
be
used
against
him
in
portash
for
impeachment
purposes
it
is
compelled
testimony
and
in
kastigar,
deciding
the
extent
of
6002
immunity
the
implication
was
there
that
it
could
not
be
used
for
any
purpose,
that
the
witness
who
had
testified
under
immunity
was
insubstantially
the
same
position
if
he
had
complained
--
if
he
had
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
and
particularly
in
view
that
the
court's
recent
statement
in
portash.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
i
believe
it
was,
your
honor,
under
if
we
are
to
maintain
the
holding
that
when
a
witness
is
compelled
to
testify
it
completely
displaces
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
his
privilege
is
not
to
incriminate
himself
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
plus
not
to
have
any
evidence
that
is
force
from
his
lips
to
be
used
against
him
in
any
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
i
would
hope
so.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
it
didn't
directly
incriminate
him
but
it
certainly
furnished
derivative
evidence
which
the
government
relied
upon
him
to
subsequently
convict
him.
it
produced
evidence
which
the
government
use
to
establish
the
corpus
delicti
of
a
crime.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
well,
your
honor
it
really
wasn't
a
future
crime
because
it
was
testimony
uttered
in
response
to
the
ordered
immunity.
the
government
didn't
prove
that
he
lied
in
october
21st
proceeding
or
even
the
september
21st
proceeding.
it
proves
that
he
might
say
this
before
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
they
could
not.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
believe
i
have
to
say
that
to
be
consistent
with
portash
and
to
be
consistent
with
the
statement
in
the
reasons
behind
the
statements
in
hockenberry
and
some
other
third
circuit,
second
circuit
decisions.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
no
question
about
it.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
clearly.
clearly,
i
would
submit
it
would
fall
within
the
exception
to
the
immunity.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
yes.
but
your
honor,
what
i
would
submit
to
the
court
is
that
when
he
was
ordered
to
testify
the
government
in
his
application
to
the
court
and
the
court
in
its
order
upon
that
application
promised
that
his
testimony
would
not
be
used
against
him
directly
or
indirectly
and
if
criminal
proceedings
against
him.
that
is
in
essence
what
happened.
it
was
used
directly
more
directly
than
the
testimony
was
used
against
portash.
this
court
decided
that
it
could
not
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes
in
the
portash
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
submit
that's
were
the
government
is
confusing
transactional
immunity
and
use
immunity.
and
i
would
--
i
would
submit
that
in
the
kastigar
ruling,
if
a
witness
testifies
before
grand
jury
to
a
certain
subject
matter
and
then
later
goes
out
and
commits
a
crime
which
may
pertain
to
that
subject
matter
transactional
immunity
would
protect
him.
i
would
submit
that
would
be
a
broader
protection
in
the
fifth
amendment
should
offer
him.
however,
when
the
very
testimony
that
is
compelled
from
his
lips
is
used
to
prove
a
crime
against
him
as
part
of
the
corpus
delicti
of
that
crime,
then
we
must
examine
whether
that
testimony
falls
within
the
exception
to
the
immunity.
unless
he
has
violated
his
bargain
with
the
government
and
the
court
by
testifying
falsely
or
otherwise
failing
to
comply
with
that
order,
failing
to
testify
and
committing
contempt,
then
i
submit
that
he
must
be
protected
by
that
immunity.
and
i
would
submit
the
reasoning
of
that
must
be
consistent
with
the
government's
positions
in
several
other
cases
that
have
come
up
one
which
is
before
the
court
in
which
the
court
has
reasonably
granted
cert
in
apfelbaum.
but
more
particularly
in
the
patrick
and
the
housand
and
berardelli
line
of
reasoning.
if
the
courts
are
going
to
continue
to
compel
witnesses
to
testify
under
an
order
of
immunity,
on
the
promise
that
it
will
not
be
used
against
them
in
inconsistent
declarations
prosecution,
regardless
of
whether
there's
prior
to
or
subsequent
to
as
long
as
it
forms
a
part
of
the
corpus
delicti
of
an
inconsistent
prosecution.
you
cannot
subsequently
use
that
testimony
in
convicting
someone
without
establishing
that
he's
violated
his
immunity
bargain.
and
we
submit
that
it
cannot
be
used
against
mr.
dunn
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
absolutely,
and
i
submit
that
it
is
no
broader
by
protecting
mr.
dunn
from
use
of
his
very
possibly
and
likely
truthful
testimony
when
he
did
compel
when
he
did
testify
in
compliance
with
court
order.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
submit
that
points
out
the
very
difference
between
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
i
would
say
the
grand
jury
testimony
could
not
be
used
against
him
but
had
he
had
transaction
immunity
it
would
have
protected
him
but
they
--
the
government
could
establish
by
extrinsic
evidence,
the
crime.
he's
not
protected
from
prosecution
for
the
crime.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
long
as
it
was
truthful
and
as
long
as
the
government
could
not
prove
that
it
was
false
or
he
had
otherwise
violated
this
immunity
order.
your
honor,
the
few
remaining
moments
i
have,
i
would
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
just
have
a
few
concluding
remarks.
your
honor,
respondent's
argument
is
preceded
on
the
basis
that
if
this
court
rules
that
immunized
testimony
cannot
be
used
in
establishing
the
corpus
delicti
of
an
inconsistent
declarations
prosecution,
that
means
anybody
has
a
free
license
to
commit
perjury.
that
is
not
what
we're
contending
in
this
case.
we're
merely
contending
that
the
government
is
obliged
once
it
offers
immunity
to
prove
that
a
man
has
perjured
himself
under
testimony.
that
was
not
established
in
this
case.
to
the
contrary,
the
evidence
in
the
record
was
that
there
was
much
to
believe
the
truthfulness
of
dunn's
grand
jury
testimony
under
compulsion.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
have
to
conceive
that
what
mr.
dunn
did
is
repugnant
to
every
moral
obligation
but
i
submit
it
was
not
a
violation
of
section
1623
and
1623
(c)
was
not
a
proper
method
of
proof.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
he
has
a
right
to
claim
the
benefits
of
that
bargain
and
yes,
he
is.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
submit
the
government
had
its
options
available.
it
had
the
option
of
taking
the
september
30th
transcript
as
extrinsic
evidence
in
proving
that
he
lied
before
the
grand
jury.
of
course
then,
the
defense
would
have
the
right
to
defend
his
grand
jury
declarations
were
truthful.
that
was
never
a
theory
in
the
case.
if
the
government
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
absolutely,
your
honor.
but
i
submit
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
we're
asking.
we're
asking
that
when
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
testimony
is
truthful
under
immunity
that
it
not
be
subsequently
use
against
him
in
a
criminal
proceeding
which
we
submit
is
the
very
ruling
of
kastigar.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
there
would
certainly
be
the
hope.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
well,
your
honor,
if
he
recants
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sears
your
honor,
only
if
he
recants
in
another
ancillary
proceeding.
but
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
and
unless
the
government
is
going
to
go
that
one
additional
step
in
providing
extrinsic
evidence
to
prove
that
one
of
his
declarations
was
false
under
1623,
then
no
violation
ensues.
and
simply
because
he
testifies
inconsistently
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
the
proceeding
on
which
hockenberry
and
(inaudible)
and
some
of
the
other
third
circuit
cases
preceded
which
this
court
need
not
accept.
but
i
think
which
was
alluded
to
in
the
portash
ruling
last
week
is
that
if
he
does
testify
truthfully,
it
should
not
be
used
against
him
for
impeachment
or
in
any
criminal
proceedings
whatsoever
and
that's
what
we
ask
the
court
to
rule.
thank
you
very
much.
