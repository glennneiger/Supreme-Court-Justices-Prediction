justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
the
submission
of
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
their
theory
of
the
case,
they
didn't
need
to.
the
way
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
they
didn't
need
to
prove
which
was
true
or
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
privi
--
yeah
--
yes,
but
his
privilege
is
not
to
incriminate
himself,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
to
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
--
that
solves
your
case.
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
--
that's
the
issue
and
that
really
is
the
issue
in
the
case
but
in
terms
of
any
past
crime.
certainly,
the
use
that
use
that
was
made
here
didn't
incriminate
them.
using
his
grand
jury
testimony
to
prove
that
he
might
have
told
the
lie
in
the
future,
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
a
future
crime,
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
--
suppose
that
the
prosecution
was
that
at
this
later
--
in
this
later
appearance
in
court.
this
later
appearance
in
court,
suppose
the
prosecution
was
that
he
perjured
himself
there.
suppose
that
was
the
charge.
it
wasn't
--
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
take
the
approach
of
an
inconsistent
statement.
but
they
were
trying
to
prove
that
he
perjured
himself
later.
could
they
use
his
grand
jury
testimony
then
to
--
as
evidence
to
show
that
he
later
perjured
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
you
have
to
say
that
or
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
also
have
to
say
it
to
maintain
your
position
with
respect
to
the
inconsistent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
agree
i
take
it
that
the
immunity
need
be
no
broader
than
the
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
suppose
--
suppose
later
some
other
person
is
charged
with
murder
or
robbery
or
something
and
also
your
client
is
charged
with
that
later
robbery
also
and
has
claimed
that
both
of
them
committed
a
robbery
and
he
says,
"well
i
was
never
there.
i
don't
even
know
that
fellow."
but
it
turns
out
that
in
this
grand
jury
testimony
that
we're
talking
about
is
where
he
was
given
immunity.
he
can
--
he
in
the
course
of
his
testimony
was
perfectly
clear
that
he
knew
this
fellow.and
he
had
a
lot
of
dealings
with
even
the
past.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
say
his
--
do
you
say
that
his
grand
jury
testimony
then
would
not
be
admissible
against
him
in
the
later
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
understand
but
you
say
that
in
his
prosecution
for
the
later
robbery
along
with
somebody
else,
his
grand
jury
testimony
could
not
be
used
against
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
no
answer
to
its
(inaudible).
it
doesn't
suggest
that
when
the
advisory
and
it
might
suggest
that
might
even
be
advisory.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
we
don't
mean
to
agree
with
you
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
look
at
the
grand
--
at
the
--
our
court
statement
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
might
be
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
we
reach
the
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
--
wasn't
this
even
more
specifically
said
by
my
brother
brennan
in
the
fried
case
in
his
--
