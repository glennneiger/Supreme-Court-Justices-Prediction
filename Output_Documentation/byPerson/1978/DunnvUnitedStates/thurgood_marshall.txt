i'm
worried
about
the
trappings
i
used
at
(inaudible)
that
you
need
to
bring
this
under
the
court.
for
example,
suppose
they
got
one
to
the
bar
and
(inaudible)?
justice

bar
and
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
try
your
false
in
the
court
as
i
can.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
it
that
makes
it
“ancillary”
to
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
right
of
the
government
to
rely
on
the
witness's
testimony
that
he
will
not
recant
it?
and
isn't
that
the
reason
for
putting
it
under
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
won't
take
that
away?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
hope
so,
it's
just
that
the
belief
that
he
shall
not
recant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
reason
you
put
him
under
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
if
he
does
recant,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
want
to
cut
that
out,
do
you?
