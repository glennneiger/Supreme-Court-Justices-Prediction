justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
he
just
didn't
wander
into
the
attorney's
office
that
day?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
it
prejudiced
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
knew
it
had
taken
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
knew
it
had
taken
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
factually
were
you
prejudiced?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
couldn't
use
it,
but
how
are
you
disadvantaged
by
your
any
inability
you
have
to
challenge
the
october
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
bill
of
particulars
to
provide
facts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
government
states
facts
in
an
indictment
or
an
information
which
show
that
a
crime
has
been
committed,
it
doesn't
have
to
tell
you
its
legal
theory,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
not
back
to
(inaudible)
pleadings,
are
we?
i
mean,
you've
got
to
show
prejudice
not
just
some
technical
defect
in
the
indictment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
you
--
you
mentioned
the
bane
case,
hasn't
that
case
been
primarily
been
notable
for
the
fact
that
almost
every
court
that
has
had
to
consider
in
last
10
to
15
years
has
distinguished
it?
i
mean,
isn't
it
pretty
much
pass√©?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
your
affidavit
by
itself
contention
is
a
good
deal
weaker
than
your
deposition
type
of
contention
because
of
the
word
proceeding
in
the
statute.
i
think
it's
a
common
practice
for
people
just
to
be
handed
affidavits
and
sure
they're
told
they
have
to
swear
to
him
and
there's
a
notary
in
the
room
but
they
may
not
read
every
word
but
that's
not
to
say
they
may
not
--
the
false
statements
may
not
be
made
punishable
but
it's
kind
of
hard
to
envision
the
signing
of
an
affidavit
as
a
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
the
formalities
of
the
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
does
that
cut
out
in
favor
or
against
you
really?
becuase
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
proceeding
concept
to
me
suggests
a
fairly
formal
type
of
situation
where
you
have
perhaps
adversary
parties
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
it
weren't
there
after
submitted
to
a
court?
what
if
it
were
simply
a
naked
affidavit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment.
are
you
speaking
in
response
to
justice
stewart's
question
of
the
privilege
of
a
defendant
and
a
criminal
case
not
to
take
the
stand?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
understood
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
a
privilege
not
to
testify
at
all
as
i
believe
and
understood
it's
a
privilege
not
to
compulsorily
incriminate
oneself.
