justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
regard
this
situation
as
a
prosecution
blunder?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sears,
you
don't
--
you
don't
disagree
with
the
fact
the
october
21st
proceeding
was
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
remember
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
he
agrees
with
you
that
they
must
establish
that
the
september
30th
affidavit
was
the
proceeding
in
order
to
sustain
that
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
agrees
to
that.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
(inaudible)
does
it
in
one
way
in
contrast
the
way
the
tenth
circuit
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
got
an
answer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
received
an
answer,
didn't
you?
to
the
bill
of
particulars?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
was
just
wondering
if
we
aren't
in
your
theory
if
you
lose
the
first
issue,
we
wouldn't
be
rendering
an
advisory
opinion.
