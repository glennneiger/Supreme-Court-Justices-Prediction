mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
is
clear
that
the
petitioner
lied,
either
in
his
grand
jury
testimony
or
in
his
subsequent
sworn
recantation
of
that
testimony.
this
is
also
a
case
in
which
it
is
clear
that
the
false
swearing
by
the
petitioner
adversely
affect
that
the
administration
of
justice
either
by
causing
mr.
musgrave
to
be
wrongfully
indicted
of
a
felony
or
by
forcing
the
government
to
drop
the
felony
charges
against
mr.
musgrave
although
they
were
all
well-founded.
now,
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
petition
is
perjury
palpable
on
its
face
from
a
comparison
of
the
contradictory
statements
may
be
proved
by
placing
those
statements
before
the
jury
or
whether
the
immunity
granted
in
connection
with
the
first
of
those
statements
preclude
such
a
course
of
proof.
now
the
case
also
involves
an
issue
about
whether
the
september
30th
statement
in
musgrave's
lawyer's
office
was
a
proceeding
ancillary
to
a
court
and
if
not
whether
that
is
fatal
to
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
i
intend
to
rely
on
our
brief
on
those
points
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
and
move
on
to
the
more
important
constitutional
immunity
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do.
but
we
say
that
it
was
proceeding
ancillary
to
a
court
and
i
might
point
out
in
that
connection
that
if
the
court
withhold
that
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
which
is
essentially
the
preparation
of
an
affidavit
for
submission
to
a
court
is
not
ancillary
to
a
court.
it
would
have
consequences
beyond
the
rather
unusual
circumstances
of
this
case
because
it
would
affect
civil
litigation
where
its
common
place
to
submit
affidavits
in
connection
with
our
opposition
to
summary
judgment,
motions
and
then
the
witness
may
get
up
at
trial
and
after
having
forced
the
trial
and
give
testimony
that's
completely
contradictory
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
also
be
ancillary
to
a
court
if
it
was
taken
for
use
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
conceded
us
with
that
as
with
a
deposition.
we
don't
contend
that
this
was
a
deposition
under
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
was
an
affidavit
and
we
say
it's
like
the
affidavit
that
would
be
prepared
for
summary
judgment
motion
or
in
connection
with
the
2255
motion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we're
not
saying
--
we
still
think
there's
no
doubt
that
the
october
21st
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
we
--
our
position
is
that
the
september
30th
proceeding
at
the
--
when
he
made
the
statement
then
and
there,
that
was
a
proceeding
ancillary
to
a
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
take
that
position
but
we
have
an
alternative
argument
that
if
the
court
is
not
satisfied
with
that
that
at
least
when
the
affidavit
is
in
fact
submitted
to
the
court,
that
it
retroactively
makes
it
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
he
in
effect
takes
his
chances
if
he
gives
sworn
testimony
that
he
knows
as
for
use
in
connection
with
the
federal
court
case.
i
don't
think
he
can
be
heard
to
complain
that
later
on
it
was
submitted
to
the
court
and
he
didn't
expect
it.
i
think
he
takes
his
chances
that
he
is
exposed
to
perjury
but
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
he
--
i
think
it's
clear
that
we
could
have
indicted
him
for
the
october
21st
proceeding.
i
don't
think
that's
really
disputed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
that
it
seems
to
me
goes
--
i
mean
the
kind
of
concern
that
you're
addressing
is
an
issue
for
the
jury
as
to
his
intent
and
knowledge
in
making
the
statements.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
--
we
are
not
suggesting
that
this
is
in
fact
the
deposition.
now,
we
are
suggesting
that
he
knew
that
it
was
for
use
in
the
court
proceeding
and
that
indeed
he
later
on
participated
in
its
presentation
in
the
court
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
some
respects
but
there
was
not
counsel
for
both
parties
to
the
case
was
not
present
and
since
it
is
connection
with
the
criminal
case
their
restrictions
on
depositions
that
don't
exist
on
the
civil
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
this
case,
well,
i
don't
--
i
can't
say
whether
there
was
hostility
or
not
but
they
were
both
on
the
same
side
of
the
musgrave
case
whatever
their
motivations
or
feelings
are.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
gather
petitioner
felt
it
better.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
want
to.
i
think
our
view
is
that
this
is
a
proceeding
ancillary
to
a
court.
i
agree
that
it
is
not
as
formal
as
many
proceedings
ancillary
to
a
court
would
be.
but
i
think
that
if
the
court
determines
that
it's
not
a
proceeding
ancillary
to
a
court
even
though
it
was
there
after
submitted
to
the
court,
as
i
say
it
will
create
a
significant
gap
in
the
covered
1623
which
was
designed
to
protect
judicial
proceedings
basically
and
to
give
added
protection
that
the
perjury
statute
1621
which
covers
all
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
say
that
if
he
simply
prepared
an
affidavit
and
put
it
in
a
mail
to
musgrave's
lawyer,
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
i'm
not
clear
that
we
would
contend
that
that
was
the
proceeding
ancillary
to
the
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
indeed,
it
was
--
he
testified
in
the
court
that
the
statements
that
he
had
made
were
wholly
true
and
that
is
grand
jury
testimony.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
so.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
right.
and
it
definitely
affected
the
provision
process.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely,
yes
it's
very
similar
to
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
suggested
that
i
would
have
a
lot
more
difficulty
with
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
because
if
it
was
never
filed
in
court,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
more
facts
if
he
went
and
he
said
we
want
you
to
make
a
statement
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
then
i
think
there
was
an
argument
that
that
would
be
ancillary
to
a
court
which
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
not
--
that's
right,
our
theory
does
not
depend
on
some
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
mean
if
he
gave
a
sworn
statement
which
was
made
before
somebody
authorize
to
administer
oaths
and
he
know
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
afraid
that
our
position
would
still
be
as
justice
stevens
suggested
that
would
be
ancillary
to
a
court
that
might
be
question
if
it
was
in
a
bar
by
whether
it
was
drunk
and
knew
what
he
was
doing
which
would
go
to
his
guilt
in
terms
because
the
statements
have
to
be
knowing
statement.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
fact
that
it
is
given
for
use
in
connection
with
the
judicial
proceeding
in
the
federal
court
and
given
under
oath.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
knowingly
given
as
a
requirement
of
the
signing
of
guilt.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
very
similar.
i'd
like
to
turn
if
i
may
to
the
--
where
we
view
as
the
more
important
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
meet
the
second
issue
but
we
suggest
that
you
should
meet
the
second
issue
because
what
will
happen
in
all
likelihood
is
that
we
will
go
back
and
re-indict
mr.
dunn
on
either
of
two
theories.
either
we
could
use
a
1621
indictment
that
is
a
straight
perjury
indictment
charging
that
his
testimony
in
the
lawyer's
office
was
false
in
using
his
grand
jury
testimony
as
evidence
of
that.
or
more
likely,
we
will
charge
an
inconsistency
between
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
the
october
21st
court
testimony
which
concededly
was
a
proceeding
before
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
same
issue
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would.
i
think
it
would
have
better
have
they
done
it
in
the
first
place
although
not
necessary.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
believe
you
would
because
it
is
an
issue
that
will
arise
in
the
further
litigation
of
this
case
and
it
will
be
back
before
the
court
shortly
assuming
you
still
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
not
yet
a
second
indictment
and
--
and
until
there
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
i
think
the
court
has
the,
in
a
two-issue
case
where
there
are
two
independent
issues,
the
court
has
the
choice
of
starting
with
on
issue
or
the
other
and
it's
a
matter
of
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
--
well,
i
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
a
constitutional
issue
that
builds
a
statutory
aspect
to
that
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
by
any
means
that
you're
required
to
reach
the
other
issue
if
you
decide
any
ancillary
proceeding
issue
adversely
to
us.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
it
would
be
not
be
improper
for
you
to
do
so.
in
view
of
the
likelihood
that
the
issue
will
persist
in
this
same
litigation
not
technically
the
same
because
it
would
be
a
new
light.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that.
it's
not
--
it's
not
necessary
to
dispose
of
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it's
the
prudential
question
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
don't
need
to
agree
with
us
now.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
might
be
right.
of
course.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
would,
yes.
now
turning
to
that
issue,
our
position
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
use
that
we
made
of
petitioner's
immunized
grand
jury
testimony
in
this
case
is
the
product
that
two
propositions
both
of
which
we
believe
to
be
reasonably
well-settled.
now,
the
first
proposition
is
that
the
immunity
that
must
be
granted
to
displace
a
valid
claim
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
has
to
be
co-extensive
with
but
need
not
be
any
broader
than
the
scope
of
the
privilege
which
was
available
to
the
witness
at
the
time
he
invoked
it.
in
other
words,
when
the
government
seeks
to
make
some
use
of
compelled
testimony
against
the
witness
who
gave
that
testimony,
the
permissibility
of
making
that
use
can
be
ascertained
by
asking
yourself
the
question,
could
he
have
invoked
the
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
to
refuse
to
answer
to
guard
against
this
prospective
use
of
his
testimony?
now,
the
second
proposition
on
which
we
rests
is
that
at
the
time
petitioner
was
called
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
and
invoked
his
privilege,
he
could
not
have
validly
invoked
his
privilege
on
the
grounds
that
later
on
he
might
choose
to
give
contradictory
testimony
and
he
did
not
want
to
create
evidence
now
that
could
be
used
to
show
the
falsity
of
subsequent
non-immunized
testimony.
now,
if
those
two
propositions
are
accepted
i
think
we
win
the
case
and
i
don't
understand
petitioner
to
contest
the
second
of
those
that
is
that
he
could
not
have
invoked
the
privilege
solely
on
the
ground
of
a
possible
future
perjury.
he
does
stoutly
maintain,
however,
that
his
immunity
is
sweeping
regardless
of
the
scope
of
his
privilege
at
the
time
he
acquired
the
immunity.
in
other
words,
he
says
he
invalidly
invoked
the
privilege
with
regard
to
his
drug
dealings
at
the
colorado
state
penitentiary,
something
that
we
don't
dispute.
consequently,
he
says
the
government
may
not
make
any
use
of
his
immunized
testimony
but
must
leave
him
in
the
same
position
as
if
he
had
not
been
compelled
to
testify.
so
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
a
valid
claim
of
the
privilege
gives
them
immunity
buff
as
to
any
criminal
case
used
of
immunized
testimony.
or
as
we
argue,
does
it
only
provide
immunity
co-extensive
with
the
privilege.
now,
the
court's
prior
decision
looked
our
way
on
this
issue.
nearly
70
years
ago,
in
glickstein
and
in
heike,
the
court
stated
the
basic
principle
that
is
central
to
our
constitutional
analysis.
for
instance
in
glickstein,
the
court
said
that
the
immunity
of
course
is
required
to
be
complete.
that
is
to
say,
in
all
respects
commensurate
with
the
protection
guaranteed
by
the
constitutional
limitation
referring
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
in
heike,
the
court
said
that
in
order
to
avoid
giving
what
it
called
a
gratuity
to
crime,
the
immunity
afforded
under
the
statute
that
was
there
in
question
should
be
construed
and
i
quote,
“as
co-terminus
with
what
otherwise
would
have
been
the
privilege
of
the
person
concerned.”
now,
this
same
theme
of
symmetry
between
the
privilege
and
the
immunity
also
underlie
this
court's
decisions
in
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission
and
in
kastigar.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
those
decisions
that
the
court
has
held
that
what
the
constitution
requires
in
the
way
of
immunity
is
defined
by
the
privilege
that
the
witness
has.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
understand
that
but
let
me
point
out
the
fallacy
in
his
position
that
he
must
be
left
in
the
same
position
as
if
he
had
not
testified
at
all?
the
first,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
and
--
will
save
himself
a
lot
of
inconvenience
as
he
would
save
himself
possibly
losing
his
job.
he
would
save
himself
public
obloquy.
he
would
save
himself
many
inconveniences
but
the
fact
that
he
is
not
left
in
the
same
position
when
he's
compelled
to
testify
as
he
would
have
been
had
that
claim
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i'm
speaking
of
the
privilege
of
a
witness
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
refused
to
answer
questions
that
are
incriminating.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
agree
although
as
to
the
particular
questions
that
were
asked
here,
he
had
a
right
not
to
answer
those
questions
because
his
answers
would
have
been
self-incriminatory.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true,
it
is
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
the
--
and
the
privilege
exists
only
in
the
areas
where
he
has
exist
only
in
the
areas
where
he
has
a
risk
of
current
self-incrimination
which
of
course
is
the
point
that
we're
saying
here
that
he
doesn't
have.
now,
the
fallacy
and
the
notion
that
he
should
be
in
the
same
position
as
if
he'd
been
allowed
to
remain
silent
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
he
can
prosecuted
for
perjury
in
making
those
statements.
he
clearly
is
not
in
the
same
position
as
if
he
had
remained
silent
and
looking
one
step
beyond
that,
why
is
it
that
he
can
be
prosecuted
for
perjury?
well,
i
think
the
reason
why
he
can
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
is
that
his
privilege
did
not
entitle
him
to
commit
perjury.
he
couldn't
invoke
the
privilege
on
the
grounds
that
his
statements
might
be
false
be
used
against
him
in
perjury
prosecution.
now,
we
say
the
very
same
thing
is
true
here.
he
could
not
invoke
his
privilege
on
the
guard
against
the
use
that
we
have
made
of
his
testimony
in
this
case.
so
therefore,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
his
argument
is
right.
now,
we
also
illustrate
our
point
by
looking
at
the
situation
with
transactional
immunity.
i
think
it
was
clear
in
kastigar
and
the
cases
before
kastigar
that
transactional
immunity
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
if
that
statute
no
longer
allows
it
but
if
petitioner
had
been
given
transaction
immunity,
as
once
was
permitted,
his
statements
could
have
been
used
against
them
to
prove
a
subsequent
perjury
because
the
transactional
immunity
would
have
been
with
regard
to
the
offenses
about
which
he
was
being
compelled
to
testify.
now,
his
answer
to
this
analysis
is
to
invoke
certain
language
in
kastigar
and
in
portash.
but
we
don't
think
that
language
was
addressed
to
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case
at
all.
the
court
was
not
examining
in
that
case
the
question
of
whether
the
immunity
must
exceed
the
scope
of
the
privilege.
in
both
cases,
what
the
court
was
talking
about
was
the
uses
that
the
witness
would
have
been
privileged
to
resist
at
the
time
testimony
was
compelled.
in
kastigar,
the
court
was
concerned
with
whether
use
and
derivative
use
immunity
was
sufficient
to
displace
the
privilege
and
in
that
respect
the
court
was
comparing
it
with
transaction
immunity
and
the
court
was
saying
that
use
and
derivative
use
immunity
since
it
protects
use
in
any
respect
of
his
evidence
is
sufficient.
clearly,
they
were
focusing
on
use
to
prove
the
crime
about
which
he
was
required
to
testify.
now,
portash
is
exactly
the
same
situation.
it's
clear
from
the
court's
holding
that
portash
had
a
right
to
invoke
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
guard
against
the
use
of
compelled
testimony
to
impeach
and
surely
be
prosecuted
for
the
crimes
about
which
he
testified
so
that
this
case
is
completely
different
and
you
can't
simply
lift
that
language
out
of
those
cases
and
in
effect,
i
think
automatically
are
unthinkingly
applied
to
this
quite
different
situation.
now,
even
if
the
constitution
permits
the
kind
of
use
immunized
testimony
that
was
made
in
the
present
case,
there
does
remain
a
question
whether
such
use
is
brought
by
the
immunity
statute
section
6002.
now,
we
of
course
contend
that
the
statute
does
not
bar
this
use.
now
at
part,
we
rely
on
the
explicit
inclusion
in
the
last
clause
of
section
6002
of
false
statement
prosecutions.
but
these
are
more
fundamental
point
that
shows
that
the
statute
is
no
bar
to
the
kind
of
use
made
here
so
long
as
that
use
is
constitutionally
permissible.
this
court
has
construed
immunity
provisions
like
that
in
6002
and
a
number
of
prior
cases.
in
glickstein
for
instance,
it
was
confronted
with
the
statute
which
barred
used
of
immunized
testimony
in
any
proceeding
and
it
held
that
that
statute
that
did
not
bar
use
in
a
perjury
prosecution.
and
in
bryan,
the
court
held
that
a
statute
which
barred
any
use
“except
in
a
prosecution
for
perjury”
did
not
bar
use
in
a
contempt
case.
now
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
recognized
that
the
kind
of
language
that
were
dealing
with
the
immunity
statute
here
refers
to
use
in
connection
with
the
prosecution
for
the
offense
that
is
disclosed
by
the
testimony
itself
and
not
for
future
offenses
such
as
contempt
or
perjury
as
to
which
the
privilege
was
unavailable
at
the
time
of
the
compelled
testimony.
now,
the
court
in
this
case
should
analyze
the
proviso
of
the
section
6002
in
precisely
the
same
manner.
and
if
it
does
so,
it
will
be
giving
to
that
statute
the
meaning
that
congress
intended.
the
immunity
statute
was
based
on
--
closely
on
the
report
of
the
national
commission
on
reform
of
federal
criminal
laws.
that
commission
proposed
that
“the
immunity
conferred
be
confine
to
the
scope
required
by
the
fifth
amendment.”
and
both
the
house
and
senate
report
stated
explicitly,
“this
statutory
immunity
is
intended
to
be
as
broad
as
but
no
broader
than
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.”
now
the
last
clause
in
section
6002
which
specifically
list
perjury
false
statement
and
the
third
clause
which
i
think
basically
they
had
in
mind,
contempt
cases
was
added
not
as
a
limitation
on
the
use
that
could
be
made
of
immunized
testimony
but
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
to
make
sure
that
no
court
would
prohibit
as
long
as
the
constitutional
allowed
it
but
no
court
would
prohibit
the
use
in
a
perjury
case
or
a
false
statement
case
or
a
contempt
case.
now,
the
same
policy
concerns
that
led
the
court
in
glickstein
and
in
bryan
to
refused
to
read
limitation
into
the
immunity
statutes
in
those
cases
are
also
operative
here.
in
effect,
what
the
court
said
in
glickstein
and
in
bryan
is
congress
can't
really
have
meant.
we
can't
believe
that
congress
meant
to
protect
the
defendant
or
the
witness
against
a
perjury
or
a
contempt
prosecution
even
though
the
constitution
doesn't
require
it
because
that
would
defeat
in
large
part
the
purpose
of
giving
him
the
immunity.
now,
the
same
is
true
in
this
case.
he
is
given
the
immunity.
he
is
compelled
to
testify
and
then
he
walks
out
of
the
grand
jury
and
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
he
encounters
the
defendant
who
is
now
indicted
and
the
defendant
apparently
by
whatever
means
persuades
him
to
recant
his
testimony.
the
recantation
has
totally
destroyed
the
value
of
the
immunity
that
this
witness
was
given.
it's
--
it's
undone
the
usefulness
of
the
statutory
scheme
that
congress
created.
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
and
certainly
not
what
congress
would
have
wanted
if
in
the
future
when
situations
like
this
arise,
an
indicted
defendant
can
say
to
a
witness
who
gave
immunized
testimony,
"well,
you
can
recant
it,
don't
worry,
look
at
dunn
against
the
united
states.
they
can't
use
your
grand
jury
testimony
to
show
that
you're
lying
the
second
time
around."
so
in
sum,
we
suggest
that
neither
the
constitution
nor
the
statute
bars
the
use
that
we
made
of
the
immunize
testimony
in
this
case
and
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
a
secondary
argument.
my
first
argument
is
that
the
agreement
never
encompassed
the
promise
not
to
make
the
kind
of
use
that
the
government
made
in
this
case,
that
the
constitution
doesn't
require
that
kind
of
a
promise
and
that
it
would
be
foolish
for
us
as
justice
white
said
in
the
concurrence
in
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission
that
it
would
be
harmfully
and
wastefully
broad
construction
of
the
immunity.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
the
fried
case
of
course
is,
it's
a
case
on
which
we
quite
strongly
rely
on.
it's
a
case
in
which
--
it
didn't
deal
with
immunity
statute
that
was
subject
to
the
construction
that
there
was
a
statutory
bar
to
a
particular
use
and
i
think
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
address
in
answering
the
chief
justice's
question.
on
the
constitutional
point,
fried
has
very
strong
support
for
us
because
of
course
in
fried
there
was
a
statute
that
gave
only
contemporaneous
and
past
offense
immunity
and
not
future
offense
immunity
and
the
court
unanimously
held
both
the
court's
opinion
and
justice
brennan
emphasized
that
he
could
not
complain
that
his
statement
might
be
used
against
him
in
connection
with
the
future
offense.
so
that
is
we've
relied
heavily
on
our
brief
in
that
point
but
there
is
an
agreement
here
that
the
constitution
may
allow
the
government
to
do
but
the
statute
doesn't
allow
it.
and
it's
to
that
argument
that
i
was
addressing
the
chief
justice's
question
and
i
was
saying
that
first
of
all
there
was
no
bargain
with
him
that
we
wouldn't
make
the
kind
of
use
that
we
made.
and
secondly,
i
think
the
chief
justice's
right
in
suggesting
that
from
a
policy
standpoint,
he's
robbed
us
of
the
--
of
what
we
were
entitled
to.
once
he
got
that
immunity,
we
were
entitled
to
his
truthful
testimony
and
he's
undone
taken
away
the
value
of
that
by
going
out
and
giving
sworn
recantation
of
that
testimony
which
destroyed
the
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
saying
that
and
it
is
(voice
overlap)
and
obviously
the
problem
only
arises
because
the
otherwise
language
is
susceptible
to
a
limiting
construction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
suggest
that
and
i
suggest
that
a
contrary
construction
adverse
to
our
position
would
not
comport
with
what
congress
must
have
intended.
thank
you.
