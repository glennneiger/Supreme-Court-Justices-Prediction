justice
william
o.

just
one
other
point
on
that,
mr.
frey.
if
instead
of
using
the
affidavit
in
the
october
21st
hearing,
it
merely
put
the
man
on
the
stand
and
had
the
affidavit
there
in
order
--
yes,
you
often
do
the
witness
had
an
affidavit
would
put
you
to
get
impeachment
necessary.
would
you
still
say
it
was
a
proceeding?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand,
would
you
still
say
the
september
30th?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
you'd
take
the
same
position
even
if
there
have
never
been
a
proceeding
on
october
21st,
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
had
the
effect
to
make
in
the
earlier
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
take
the
chance
that
you
could
have
indicted
him
october
21st
proceeding
also.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
understand
your
position
which
i'm
sure
i'm
right.
you
would
take
the
same
position
if
instead
of
happening
it
in
the
lawyer's
office
the
lawyer
would
send
an
investigator
out
to
his
house
for
example.
you
got
to
him
sign
the
affidavit
and
then
they
never
even
filed
the
affidavit
in
court
you'd
still
say
the
same
thing.
justice
william
o.
douglas
why?
what's
the
difference
between
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
right.(voice
overlap)
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
simply,
your
argument
is
exactly
the
same
if
i
read
your
brief
correctly.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
you
don't
require
it
to
actually
be
filed
under
your
theory.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
if
it's
in
a
lawyer's
office.
it's
a
sworn
statement
for
use
in
connection
with
the
allegation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
constitutional
issue
or
the
statutory
issue,
which
do
we
start
with?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
you
think
that
the
--
your
position
is
the
immunity
statute
co-extensive
with
the
constitutional
privilege
that's
really
a
constitutional
issue.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
don't
we
normally
start
with
the
statutory
issue?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it
would
persist
that
if
there's
an
acquittal,
it's
all
over
then
there'd
be
no
appeal,
there
will
be
no
nothing.
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
frey,
this
is
really
an
ancillary.
if
i
understand
you
correctly
to
the
statutory
argument
based
on
the
words
or
otherwise
because
you're
in
effect
saying
that
by
recanting
he
breaches
the
--
he
violates
the
substance
or
just
as
much
as
if
he
have
given
false
testimony
in
the
first
place.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
even
if
you
give
it
to
limiting
instructions,
usually
you've
made
an
ancillary
in
the
sense
that
just
as
he
had
an
obligation
to
tell
the
truth,
he
also
implicitly
has
agreed
not
to
recant?
