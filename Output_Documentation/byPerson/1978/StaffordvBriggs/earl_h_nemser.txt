mr.
earl
h.
nemser
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
want
to
pick
up
for
a
minute
since
we
are
talking
about,
really,
the
same
issues
on
what
mrs.
peterson
just
mentioned
and
she
talked
about
that
one
sentence
from
the
legislative
history
which
mr.
brown
referred
to.
i
don't
want
the
court
to
be
misled
by
the
sentence
because
the
first
circuit
was
misled
by
it
and
the
district
court
was
misled
by
it.
so,
let's
read
it.
it
says
“the
venue
problem
also
arises
in
damage
actions
against
federal
officials.”
what
was
the
venue
problem?
the
venue
problem
was
that
certain
suits
were
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia
only.
right
above
that
sentence,
it
says
“the
venue
problem
--
the
problem
of
venue
in
actions
against
government
officials
arises
when
the
action
must
be
brought
against
the
official
in
the
district
of
columbia,”
and
the
report
says
“that
venue
problem
also
arises
in
suits
against
federal
officials
for
damages.”
so,
to
understand
what
congress
meant,
we've
got
to
say
“think,
where
did
that
venue
problem
arise
in
suits
against
federal
officials
for
damages?”
only
in
one
type
of
damage
action.
that
type
of
damage
action
which
was
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
and
which
sought
to
compel
payment
of
money.
this
court
referred
to
1391
(e)
in
south
carolina
against
pat
katzenbach,
i
believe,
and
it
said
when
you
sue
federal
officials,
you
could
now
sue
them
outside
of
washington,
d.c
and,
in
a
footnote,
it
said
“see
stroud
against
benson.”
stroud
against
benson
was
just
that
kind
of
damage
action.
it
sought
to
compel
a
payment
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
from
a
federal
official
and
that
damage
action
was,
at
the
time
this
act
was
enacted,
limited
to
section
1391
(e).
and,
i
think
we
had
a
serious
problem
that
the
first
circuit
and
respondents
read
this
one
sentence
in
isolation
and
didn't
read
it
in
the
context
of
the
whole
committee
report.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
well,
the
respon
--
we
quoted
it
--
the
respondents
quoted
it
about
every
10
pages.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
well,
the
house
report
is
attached
to
our
cert
petition
and,
if
you
have
that,
it's
--
will
appear
at
page
92
(a)
of
our
cert
petition.
and,
if
you
look
just
at
the
paragraph
above
that,
there's
the
venue
problem
they
were
talking
about.
i
just
want
to
spend
another
minute
on
the
clear
wording
of
the
statute
which
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
some
questions
about.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
second
to
the
bottom
paragraph.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
well,
that's
it,
quoted,
yes.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
verbatim,
yes.
the
house
report
begins
on
page
89
(a),
which
is
appendix
e.
the
plain
wording
of
the
statute,
in
our
view,
covers
only
actions
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
when
you
sue
a
federal
official
in
a
civil
action
acting
in
his
official
capacity
or
under
color
of
law,
he's
acting.
he's
acting
like
an
official
and
you
need
a
mandamus
to
force
him
to
act
correctly
or
an
injunction
to
stop
him
from
acting
improperly.
if
you're
going
to
sue
him
from
damages,
he
has
already
acted.
he
acted
a
long
time
ago
and
now
you
want
to
get
damages.
if
congress
wanted
to
include
damage
actions,
it
would've
left
out
the
phrase
acting
in
his
official
capacity
or
under
color
of
legal
authority
and
it
would
have
just
said,
a
civil
action
in
which
a
defendant
is
an
officer
employee
or
an
agency
of
the
united
states.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
yes.
take
a
look
at
what
the
house
committee
report
said
about
that.
it
was
very
specific,
the
senate
report
i
think
has
the
same
language
and,
again,
the
first
circuit
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i'm
taking
a
look
at
it,
page
94
(a).
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
of
the
cert
petition.
“by
including
the
officer
or
employee,
both
in
his
official
capacity
and
acting
under
color
of
legal
authority,
the
committee
intends
to
make
1391
(e)
applicable
to
those
cases
where
an
action
may
be
brought
against
an
officer
or
employee
in
his
official
capacity,”
and
then
we
say
“what
else
did
it
intend
to
do?”
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
“not
only,”
then
what
does
it
say?
“it
intends
to
include
also
those
cases
where
the
action
is
nominally
brought
against
the
official
in
his
individual
capacity
even
though
he
was
acting
within
the
c
--
parent
scope
of
his
authority,”
and
then
it
says
“these
cases
are,
in
essence,
against
the
united
states.”
the
driver
case
against
colby
is
not
nominally
against
colby.
it's
not
nominally
against
walters.
they're
not,
in
essence,
against
the
united
states.
they're,
in
essence,
against
colby's
pocketbook
and
walter's
pocketbook.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
that's
exactly
what
the
committee
reports
indicate
that
was
in
mind,
and
they
could
not
have
meant
that
these
types
of
action
were
in
mind,
well
for
one
reason,
is
that
they
didn't
exist
then.
but,
there's
not
one
mention
of
it,
and
if
this
is
to
be
the
most
radical
departure
from
our
rules
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
and
if
congress
intended
to
do
this,
there
would've
been
a
loud
cry
in
1962
and
we'd
all
have
known
about
it.
it
would've
been
clearly
expressed,
and
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i
guess
that's
right.
i
guess,
since
they
didn't
exist,
we
really
wouldn't
have
even
known
it.
that
means,
congress
hadn't
been
--
had
to
have
been
legislating
in
this
area
without
knowledge
of
it,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
questions
raised
in
nlrb
against
the
catholic
bishop
of
chicago
recently
or
suede
against
presley,
“do
we
have
a
substantial
constitutional
issue
that
must
be
avoided?”
i
think
i've
shown
the
statute
is
susceptible
to
two
fair
readings,
at
least.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
and
if
you
go
back
to,
i
guess,
ex
parte
young
where
they
have
the
famous
language
“when
an
official
acts
beyond
the
scope
of
his
authority,
he's
stripped
of
his
official
capacity
and
he's
acting
like
an
individual.
you're
trying
to
get
damage
from
him,
you're
trying
to
get
damages
against
him
as
a
private
person.”
i
think
that
language
is
important,
but
--
i
mean,
it's
very
important.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
as
a
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
when
you
sue
william
colby
as
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
when
you
sue
william
colby
as
director
of
instel
--
central
intelligence,
you're
suing
him
as
an
official.
when
you
sue
him
as
an
individual
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i
don't
think
it
would've
been
read
that
way.
i
think
it
would've
been
read
to
prove
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
judge
petin
said
that
one
thing
every
court's
opinion
and
it
is
about
is
that
the
statute
isn't
clear
on
its
face.
i
don't
have
a
suggestion
better
than
the
one
i
gave
you.
maybe
they
should
have
said
“in
mandamus
suits,”
i
don't
know.
i
think
they
struggled.
petin
said
it
wasn't
clear
in
its
face.
the
first
circuit
said
the
legislative
history,
at
best,
was
ambiguous.
so,
where
do
you
go
from
there
when
you
have
justice
brandais
saying
“you've
got
to
clearly
express
exceptions
from
our
general
rules
of
in
personam
jurisdiction.”
to
interpret
section
1391
(e)
this
way,
and
i
want
to
spend
a
few
minutes
on
the
constitutional
issue,
would
be
the
most
radical
departure
from
our
traditions
of
in
personam
jurisdiction.
it
would
subject
colby
and
walters
to
jurisdiction
in
hawaii,
in
alaska,
in
every
state
of
the
country
even
though
they've
had
no
contact
whatsoever
with
those
forums
without
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
well,
i
don't
think
this
court
ever
said
congress
had
that
power.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
it
doesn't
have
that
power.
it
has
that
power
in
special
classes
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
congress
has
power
to
define
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts.
our
question
is,
what
limitation
does
the
fifth
amendment
impose
on
the
exercise
of
that
power,
if
that
power
is
to
be
exercised
in
a
manner
which
places
an
intolerable
burden
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i
do.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i
do.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i
still
do.[attempt
to
laughter]
this
court
has
never
addressed
it.
in
toland
against
sprague,
we
were
talking
about
whether
a
foreign
attachment
could
be
issued
against
a
non-us
domiciliary.
in
union
pacific
railroad,
100
years
before
shaffer
against
heitner
and
just
after
pennoyer,
we
were
talking
about
whether
in
one
case
the
attorney
general
could
bring
a
suit
against
the
railroad.
in
mississippi
against
murphy,
we
were
talking
about
whether
someone
could
be
sued
in
the
northern
district
rather
than
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
we
think
that
justice
marshall's
decision
in
shaffer
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
took
care
of
pennoyer,
put
it
to
rest
forever,
and
said
that
territorial
power,
which
the
united
states
has
over
all
of
us,
is
no
longer
essential
and
sufficient
for
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction.
now,
we've
got
to
measure
jurisdiction
by
our
traditional
notions
of
fair
play,
and
substantial
justice.
and,
we
say
that
to
make
colby
and
walters
travel
to
rhode
island
to
defend
this
suit
would
violate
those
principles
and
raise
serious
constitutional
issues
and,
because
it
would
impose
an
intolerable
burden
on
the
right
to
defend
a
right
addressed
in
boddie
against
connecticut.
it
would,
in
fact,
violate
fifth
amendment
due
process
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
chief
justice
burger
pointed
out
in
this
morning's
arguments
that
the
facts
of
this
case
aren't
--
cases,
the
colby
case
and
the
tandem
case,
the
stafford
case
this
morning,
are
not
the
most
important
elements
of
the
case
because
we're
dealing
with
a
relatively
narrow
personal
jurisdiction
issue.
but
i
thought
i
would
just
briefly
give
you
the
jurisdictional
facts
in
the
colby
case.
the
jurisdictional
facts
are
that
colby
has
no
presence
in
rhode
island
and
that
walters
has
no
presence
in
rhode
island.
colby
was
director
of
central
intelligence.
his
office
was
in
virginia.
he
resides
in
maryland.
general
walters
was
deputy
director
of
central
intelligence.
he
resided
in
virginia.
he
now
resides
in
florida.
judge
pettine
found
in
the
district
court
in
rhode
island
that
colby
and
walters
did
not
have
sufficient
presence
in
that
district
to
satisfy
the
rhode
island
long-arm
statute
which
is
one
of
the
broad
ones
that
extends
personal
jurisdiction
as
far
as
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
will
permit.
the
facts
of
course
in
colby
involved
the
mail
opening
program
and
i
think
that's
adequately
been
covered.
the
--
there
was
one
thing
this
morning
that
was
discussed
that
i'd
like
to
touch
on
before
i
talk
about
the
two
points
i
plan
to
talk
about
and
that
was
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
had
a
discussion
with
mr.
brown
and
the
question
was,
what
about
habeas
corpus
and
what
about
schlanger?
and
wouldn't
you
have
to
or
would
you
not
have
to
reverse
schlanger
if
you
didn't
find
for
us
in
this
case?
i
think
you'd
have
to
reverse
schlanger.
the
arguments
for
not
reversing
schlanger
would
be
that
in
habeas
corpus
there
is
a
special
jurisdictional
section
and
the
first
circuit
held
that
habeas
corpus
falls
into
the
otherwise
provided
by
law
section
1391
(e).
well,
it
does
not.
i
read
2241
at
least
a
dozen
times.
i
just
read
it
again
and
i
read
strait
against
laird.
24
--
2241
does
not
provide
for
jurisdiction.
it
does
not
provide
for
the
venue.
all
it
says
is
that
the
courts
can
issue
the
writs
within
their
respective
jurisdictions.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i
would
presume
that
that's
what
congress
would
have
meant.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
nevertheless,
schlanger
says
that
habeas
corpus
isn't
like
in
all
respects
every
civil
actions
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
and
the
point
of
that,
schlanger
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
wait
a
minute
the
--
the
rule
governing
personal
jurisdiction
in
habeas
corpus
is
set
forth
in
strait
against
laird
where
the
court
said
and
mr.
douglas
--
justice
douglas
wrote,
that
jurisdiction
over
the
custodian
is
like
any
other
rule
of
jurisdiction.
you've
got
to
be
present
and
he
cites
international
shoe.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
he
also
wrote
schlanger
and
in
schlanger,
what
he
said
was
--
the
interesting
thing
about
it
was,
in
schlanger
he
said
the
commanding
officer
and
i
quote,
“but
he
was
neither
a
resident
of
the
arizona
judicial
district
nor
amenable
to
its
process.”
now,
if
1391
(e)
makes
federal
officials
amenable
to
process
all
throughout
the
country,
you
have
to
reverse
schlanger.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i
know
but
i
don't
know
why
you
dissented
because
you
didn't
file
an
opinion.
you
didn't
dissent
straight
though.
the
--
the
two
points
i
want
to
make
is
what
standard
do
you
have
to
apply
in
evaluating
this
statute.
and
i
say
that
because
of
two
sources,
one,
justice
brandeis'
opinion
in
robertson
and
second,
mr.
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
in
nlrb
against
catholic
bishop
of
chicago,
the
standard
is,
this
statute
cannot
be
interpreted
to
supply
personal
jurisdiction
over
federal
officials
throughout
the
united
states
unless
there
is
clear
expression
of
legislative
intent.
that
comes
from
robertson,
the
standard
from
catholic
bishop
is
--
because
there's
a
substantial
constitutional
question
presented,
you
can't
read
the
statute
to
provide
jurisdiction
unless
there's
an
affirmative
intent
of
congress
clearly
expressed.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
this
is
one
country
by
the
personal
jurisdiction
is
no
longer
and
it
has
never
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
based
solely
on
territorial
power.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
of
course
it
does,
but
it's
carefully
limited.
it
says,
"you
only
have
venue
where
the
course
of
action
arose,
where
the
defendants
reside,
or
where
an
act
took
place
by
a
defendant."
so
it
certainly
satisfies
fifth
amendment
due
process
because
there
are
some
affiliating
circumstances
with
the
district.
and
to
go
to
the
district,
we
commit
securities
fraud
to
defend
an
action
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
place
an
intolerable
burden
on
the
right
to
defend
to
coerce
colby
to
go
to
san
francisco,
rhode
island,
new
york,
to
defend
the
same
action,
to
bring
his
witnesses,
to
go
there
for
depositions.
i
say,
imposes
intolerable
burden
on
his
right
to
defend
his
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
in
boddie
against
connecticut
where
to
get
a
divorce
you
have
to
file
a
$12.00
filing
fee.
this
court
held
at
a
minimum
due
process
and
this
is
in
fifth
to
fourteenth
amendment
had
a
minimum
due
process
requires
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
if
you
don't
have
the
$14.00
for
filing
fee,
you
don't
have
that
opportunity.our
clients
cannot
afford
to
run
around
the
country
defending
actions
because
while
they
were
federal
officials,
someone
has
a
gripe.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i'm
looking
at
the
statute
on
its
face.
and
i
say
on
its
face
to
require
someone,
nelson
rockefeller
or
anyone
else
to
expand
such
a
substantial
amount
of
his
assets
to
travel
around
the
country
defending
lawsuits
where
they
didn't
ask
for
it.
they
didn't
step
into
a
district
would
place
an
intolerable
burden
on
that
right
to
defend.
and
the
court
has
never
done
otherwise.
every
time
the
court's
been
faced
with
the
issue
of
whether
there's
any
fifth
amendment
limitation
on
congress'
power
to
provide
nationwide
jurisdiction
they
point
it
out
in
the
case
before
them.
well,
here,
there's
no
intolerable
burden.
in
our
case,
there
is
one.
and
i
pointed
out
in
my
supplemental
brief
that
in
leroy
case
just
recently
decided.
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
i
believe
it
was
written
by
mr.
justice
white,
he
said,
"of
course
there's
nationwide
jurisdiction
which
is
constitutional
in
the
federal
courts
because
there's
no
fifth
amendment
limitation."
but
what
does
he
cite?
no
decision
from
this
court
because
there
is
none.
he
decides
--
he
cites
a
seventh
circuit
case,
the
simmons
case
which
we
discussed,
he
hasn't
point
out
there's
even
a
split
in
the
seventh
circuit.
in
metz
apparatewerke
cited
in
my
brief,
the
seventh
circuit
said,
"yes,
there
is
a
finest
limitation
on
the
exercise
of
power
to
--
congressional
power
to
provide
nationwide
jurisdiction
and
it's
fundamental
fairness,
fair
play
similar
to
the
international
shoe
standard."
the
--
the
thing
that
i
believe,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
you
applied
it
in
our
case
but
i
believe
that
there
is
no
question
that
there's
a
substantial
question
raised.
henry-hatton
and
hatton-wexler
discussed
it
and
say,
it's
a
substantial
question,
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
the
same
language,
due
process.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
that's
right,
because
only
maryland
or
d.c.
could
issue
mandamus.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
unfair
to
the
plaintiff
you
mean?
well,
due
process
protects
defendants.
you
shouldn't
have
your
property
taken
away
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
and
it
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
to
make
him
travel
to
washington
to
prosecute
his
case
as
a
plaintiff.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
i
--
i
think
it
--
i
was
--
i
would
be
sympathetic
to
his
plight
and
congress
was,
but
the
question
of
what
due
process
prevents
in
a
litigation
protects
in
a
litigation
setting,
it
protects
defendants,
and
it's
been
pointed
out
by
this
court.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
well,
the
question
in
this
case
also
is
whether
this
statute
provides
personal
jurisdiction.
we
have
a
section
on
our
main
brief
which
is
devoted
to
that
and
we
say,
it
supplies
only
venue
not
personal
jurisdiction.
the
--
the
question
of
whether
it
provide
--
if
it
didn't
provide
personal
jurisdiction,
we
would
be
out
of
the
case
because
there'd
be
no
basis
to
have
personal
jurisdiction
over
us.
our
argument
was
discussed
in
the
first
circuit's
opinion
and
rejected.
i
believe
it
is
a
valid
argument.
i
believe
it
is
valid
because
congress
often
times
provides
for
service
of
process.
the
federal
rules
tell
you
how
to
serve
process
but
they
don't
tell
you
when
someone
is
amendable
to
service
or
subject
to
jurisdiction.
that
whole
area
is
based
on
another
area
of
the
law,
presence,
specific
jurisdictional
statute
and
the
robertson
case
is
instructive
there.
the
court
should
not
interpret
a
statute
to
provide
in
personam
jurisdiction
because
we
have
general
rules
about
it
unless
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
service
of
process
is
nationwide.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
yes.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
the
service
of
process
isn't
the
same
as
personal
jurisdiction.
for
example,
in
new
york,
the
long-arm
statute
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
right.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
there
are
three
things
we're
talking
about,
service,
venue,
and
personal
jurisdiction.
the
--
the
general
rule
of
personal
jurisdiction
set
forth
in
the
robertson
case
is
that
you
get
sued,
defendants
get
sued
to
where
they
live,
where
they're
present,
where
they're
found.
robertson
said,
there
have
been
very
few
departures
from
this
general
rule
and
they've
all
been
carefully
guarded
and
clearly
expressed
and
it
shouldn't
be
likely
assumed
that
congress
intends
and
to
depart
from
long
established
policies.
so,
what
do
we
have
to
get
congressional
intent?
ms.
peterson
this
morning
said,
we
have
a
lot
of
discussion
about
damage
actions,
we
did
not.
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
there's
this
passing
reference
in
the
hearings
where
four
congressmen
where
present,
just
four.
where
macguineas
and
if
you
read
the
hearings,
you
could
tell
this
subcommittee
did
not
like
macguineas.
he
was
bothering
them.
he
told
them,
you're
giving
us
problems
that
--
the
committee
said
to
macguineas,
you're
giving
us
problems
that
we
don't
want
to
deal
with.
you're
telling
us
that
we're
going
to
go
to
official's
pocketbooks.
we're
not
dealing
with
that.
we
don't
want
to
deal
that.
by
the
way,
you're
too
busy
to
study
this,
you
tell
us,
they
say
in
the
hearings,
"you're
too
busy
trying
cases,
bring
someone
else
down
from
justice
to
talk
to
us."
they
were
tired
of
hearing
from
him.
so
what
did
they
do?
they
put
in
their
committee
report
the
thing
that
was
before
all
the
congressmen
what
was
intended
by
the
statute,
what's
it
say?
it's
--
it's
got
one
theme.
these
are
government
suits,
suits
against
the
government.
it
says,
it
covers
suits
against
government
officials
that
can
now
be
brought
only
in
d.c.
not
my
case,
not
the
personal
damage
cases,
suits
to
compel
a
federal
officer
to
perform
a
duty.
three
times
it
says,
suits
in
essence
against
the
united
states.
twice
it
says,
we're
talking
about
suits
nominally
against
officials.
it
goes
on
to
say,
we're
talking
about
suits
against
officials
as
individuals
but
when
we
sue
them
under
the
fiction
that
they're
acting
us
individuals
and
it
says,
there's
no
problem
in
this
case,
it
tells
congress
this
committee
report.
there's
no
problem
because
the
government
always
defends
them.
now,
it's
incredible
to
me
that
it
can
be
suggested
that
congress
was
alerted
in
the
face
of
all
this.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
1391
(e)
doesn't
apply
because
they're
trying
to
get
money
out
of
his
pocketbook.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
the
government
would
defend
only
if
it
found,
a,
it
was
in
the
interest
the
united
states
to
defend
them,
b,
to
defend
and
acted
within
the
scope
with
his
authority,
and
c,
the
defendant
didn't
commit
any
crime
and
there's
no
criminal
investigation.
now,
in
a
related
case,
the
blackburn
case
which
mr.
brown
mentioned
this
morning,
(inaudible)
the
defendant
but
he
was
criminally
investigated,
so
he
pays
his
own
attorney's
fees.
if
the
government
decides
it's
no
longer
in
their
interest
to
defend
my
client,
my
client
will
have
to
pay.
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
the
katzenbach
memorandum
--
katzenbach
is
not
a
congressman,
he
was
not
a
congressman.s
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
if
he
assumes
--
mr.
earl
h.
nemser
that
memorandum
assumed
it
and
he
did
not
talk
about
the
three
exceptions
which
are
in
28
cfr
50.15.
it's
not
regulations.
it's
just
justice
department
policy
which
can
change
tomorrow
or
the
next
day.
we
submit
our
case.
