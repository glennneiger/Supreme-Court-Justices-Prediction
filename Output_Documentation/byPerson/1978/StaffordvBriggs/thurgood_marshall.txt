justice

there
was
another
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
back
in
the
good
old
days
when
you
got
on
to
a
government
official,
they
moved
them.
wasn't
it
law
for
that
purpose
too?
i'm
not
talking
about
the
“out
of
the
pocket.”
i
mean,
when
you
want
to
bring
mandamus
against
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
gone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
object
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
petitioner
doesn't
disagree
with
you
on
that.
i
understand
the
petitioner
says
you
can
sue
them,
but
you
can't
sue
his
pocketbook.
you
can
sue
him
for
mandamus
and
anything
else
that
doesn't
involve
his
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
congress
really
intended
that
this
group
of
people
should
be
the
only
people
in
the
world
in
the
united
states
can
be
sued
any
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
congress
meant
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
congress
meant
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
they
defendants
in
this
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
they
defending
this
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
paying
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
counsel
fees
indicate
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was
now.
i
didn't
say
about
on
any
day.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
“are
they,”
that
means
“now.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
now
paying
the
lawyers
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
this
action?
are
they
paying
mr.
brown
right
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
the
government
pay
the
judgment
if
there
is
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
the
jud
--
will
the
government
pay
the
judgment
if
there
is
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
so.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
what
i'm
worried
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
congress
has
that
power,
if
it
wants
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
congress
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
congress
didn't
have
power
with
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
you
need
to
continue.
you
don't
attack
it
on
that
basis,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
it's
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
still
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
took
care
of
pennoyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wulf,
you
keep
saying
big
case.
why
did
you
bring
it
in
the
small
state?
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it's
the
smallest,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
weren't
passing
legislation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
were
not
passing
legislations.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
but
they
weren't
passing
legislation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
attorney
general,
after
the
act
was
passed,
had
no
place
in
legislative
history,
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
been
paid
the
judgment
recently?[attempt
to
laughter]
