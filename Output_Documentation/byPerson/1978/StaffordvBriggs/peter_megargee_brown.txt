mr.
peter
megargee
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
stafford
against
briggs,
in
tandem
with
colby
v.
driver,
the
next
case
to
be
heard,
was
argued
here
last
april
24.
and
on
may
4,
this
court
placed
it
on
the
calendar
for
reargument
now.
very
briefly,
this
is
a
case
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
colby
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
first
circuit.
in
both
cases,
the
same
precise
issue
is
presented.
did
congress
intend,
in
enacting
the
mandamus
and
venue
act
of
1962
to
grant
to
the
district
courts
national
--
nationwide
personal
jurisdiction
over
federal
officials
sued
for
money
damages
in
their
pocketbooks
for
acts
allegedly
performed
under
color
of
law.
in
other
words,
did
congress
intend
back
in
1962
that
federal
officials
can
be
sued
not
only,
in
essence,
against
the
united
states,
administrative
actions,
judicial
review
of
those
involving
the
interests
of
the
united
states,
but
also,
as
respondents
claimed,
in
essence
against
their
own
pocketbooks,
in
any
court
of
the
country,
regardless
of
where
the
harried
official
works
or
lives
a
burden
never
before
imposed
on
the
citizenry?
did
congress
intend
this
discrimination
against
federal
employees?
now,
stafford
against
briggs
is
a
bivens
type
action,
civil
rights
tort
alleging
unconstitutional
acts.
all
of
the
alleged
acts
took
place
in
florida.
plaintiffs
chose
to
bring
their
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia,
seeking
$1.5
million
from
the
private
assets
of
four
individuals
who
were,
or
are,
federal
employees.
plaintiffs'
counsel
acknowledged
that
this
case
was
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
after
shopping
for
the
most
favorable
forum.
similarly,
mr.
wulf,
in
his
oral
argument
on
april
24,
conceded
that
rhode
island
was
selected
because,
“we
did
not
think
it
was
an
inhospitable
forum,
as
a
matter
of
fact.”
who
are
the
defendants
in
stafford
against
briggs?
it
would
be
helpful
to
put
this
in
perspective.
first
is
petitioner
william
stafford,
then
united
states
attorney
for
the
northern
district
of
florida,
now
a
united
states
district
judge
in
the
northern
district
of
florida.
petitioner
carrouth,
assistant
u.s.
attorney
in
the
northern
district
of
florida,
now
in
private
practice
in
florida.
petitioner
meadow,
a
special
agent
of
the
fbi
stationed
in
florida,
still
working
in
florida.
so
all
of
the
petitioners
have
roots
in
florida,
they're
not
floating
public
officials.
and
--
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
yes?
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
yes,
i
understand
that
the
case
is
proceeding
against
a
non-petitioner
named
guy
goodwin.
he
is
a
u.s.
prosecutor
in
the
department
of
justice,
and
i've
been
told
on
the
telephone
that
there's
been
discovery
in
that
--
in
that
case.
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
important
to
know
that
nothing
has
been
tried
on
the
merits
in
stafford
against
briggs.
now
--
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
oh,
in
blackburn
against
goodwin,
that's
the
same
buffetted
goodwin,
he's
being
sued
up
in
new
york.
and
he
was
--
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
the
second
circuit
ruled
on
september
10.
they
decided
to
write
after
there
was
this
reargument,
and
they
held
that
1391
(e),
which
is
the
second
section
of
the
mandamus
and
venue
act,
did
not
apply
to
bivens
type
actions,
and
that
the
actions,
in
order
for
the
statute
to
apply,
had
to
be,
in
essence,
against
the
united
states.
and
it's
not
in
essence
against
the
united
states
to
sue
goodwin
in
his
pocketbook.
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
your
honor,
it's
--
that
panel
came
down
with
a
decision
which
in
an
articulate
and
well
presented
way
was
the
argument
that
i
tried
to
make
on
april
24.
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
yes,
your
honor.
we
did
file
one
in
this
term,
a
supplemental
brief,
in
which
if
you
look
at
it
you'll
find
that
it's
nothing
more
than
making
exhibit
a
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
panel
which
was
smith,
mansfield
and
--
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
--
mulligan.
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
i
might
say
a
word
about
that,
that
the
writer
of
the
decision
is
--
was
dean
of
fordham
law
school.
just
one
second
on
who
the
plaintiffs
are
--
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
well,
he
has
both.
plaintiffs
are
--
were
anti-war
demonstrators.
they
were
called
before
a
grand
jury
in
florida.
none
of
these
plaintiffs
in
stafford
below
reside
in
the
district
of
columbia.
they
were
indicted
for
conspiracy.
their
case
became
known
as
the
gainesville
eight,
and
each
was
acquitted.
their
complaint
is
that
goodwin
somehow
did
a
little
dissembling
before
they
went
to
the
grand
jury,
even
though
they
were
acquitted,
and
that
this
violated
their
constitutional
rights,
and
that
therefore
--
therefore
stafford
and
carrouth
and
meadow,
who
didn't
say
anything
have
to
come
to
the
district
of
columbia
under
this
mandamus
and
venue
act
misuse
and
defend
themselves
for
months
and
months
and
months,
even
though
they're
resident
in
florida,
and
even
though
they
could
not
under
normal
and
regular
procedures
applicable
to
all
citizens
be
sued
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
we're
not
here
saying
public
officials
cannot
be
sued
for
wrongful
acts
under
color
of
law.
we
say
that
--
that
they
can
be
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
place
to
sue
them
is
in
florida,
and
that's
where
the
respondents
concede.
they
could
have
sued
all
of
them
in
florida.
so
it's
not
a
problem
of
multiplicity
of
suits,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
they
can
sue
them
in
florida.
now,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
determined
that
notwithstanding
that
the
second
section
of
the
mandamus
and
venue
act
does
give
personal
jurisdiction
over
these
florida
residents
and
this
is
the
question
before
this
court
at
this
time.
my
argument
is
--
is
a
simple
one.
it's
--
it's
one
point
common
to
petitioners
in
this
case
and
in
the
tandem
colby
case.
and
that
is
that
the
statute
involved
here
simply
does
not
apply
to
respondent
suits
against
federal
officials'
pocketbooks.
it
wasn't
intended
to
do
that.
there
is
nothing
in
the
purpose,
the
history,
of
the
statute
to
show
that
that
was
so.
specifically,
that
section
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
supply
jurisdiction
and
venue
in
tort
suits
and
certainly
not
in
--
in
bivens
type
actions
which
in
1962
were
not
heard
of,
and
it
was
nine
years
later
--
it
was
on
june
21,
1971
that
mr.
justice
brennan's
decision
came
down
in
bivens,
and
it
was
--
it
was
a
new
law
and
new
application.
so
that
the
basic
reasons
that
--
that
i
believe
that
the
first
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
have
made
a
mistake,
and
that
the
second
circuit
is
correct
is,
(a)
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
a
single-theme
purpose,
and
it
doesn't
include
suing
people
for
a
million
and
a
half
in
their
pocketbooks,
public
officials,
or
a
billion
dollars
in
rhode
island
where
none
of
them
have
ever
been
--
against
their
pocketbooks
in
rhode
island
in
colby.
and
the
history
of
the
statute
makes
clear
that
it
wasn't
intended
to
--
to
apply
to
pocketbook
suits.
and
we
also
take
the
position
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
that
is
the
mandamus
and
venue
act
of
1962,
the
statute
at
large,
that
read
as
a
whole,
as
it
must
be,
shows
that
this
is
a
--
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
suit,
it
involves
in
essence
against
the
united
states
and
it
--
it
doesn't
involve
bivens
type
tort
actions,
pocketbook
suits.
so
that,
when
the
statute
is
read
in
its
full
context,
with
realization
of
its
purpose,
and
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history,
it
becomes
clear
that
congress
did
not
direct
or
intend
a
coverage
of
the
bivens
type
actions.
now,
in
blackburn,
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
thing
about
blackburn
internally.
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
mr.
goodwin.
mr.
goodwin
resides
in
washington,
d.c.
he's
sued
by
--
by
the
civil
rights
bar
in
--
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
--
in
blackburn.
he's
also
sued
in
another
case
there
called
cole,
and
they
treated
them
together.
but
he's
sued
twice,
hit
twice,
like
a
shuttlecock,
in
new
york.
now,
the
district
court
made
a
holding,
which
was
not
appealed,
that
there
wasn't
the
slightest
evidence
connecting
goodwin
to
a
conspiracy
as
alleged
in
new
york.
no
evidence,
no
threshold
evidence
therefore,
the
long
arm
statute,
he
held,
goes
out.
however,
the
district
court
judge
haight
found
that
1391
(e)
did
give
the
jurisdiction.
now
there's
the
abuse.
not
the
slightest
evidence
under
the
long
arm
statute,
but
ah-hah,
1391
(e),
somehow
or
other,
because
perhaps
of
the
climate
of
thinking
today,
can
reach
out
and
bring
goodwin
in
and
make
him
go
through
motions
to
dismiss,
discovery
motions,
and
a
--
and
a
harassed
life.
now,
it
was
--
it
was
that
holding
of
the
district
court
on
1391
(e)
that
the
panel
reversed.
we
argued
in
march.
they
came
down
september
10
with
their
opinion
which
is
exhibit
a.
now,
i
say
that
there
are
several
things
that
show
that
pocketbook
suits
are
not
included
by
the
intention
of
congress
in
1962.
the
first
is
that
section
1391
(e),
which
is
found
codified
in
the
--
in
the
venue
part
of
the
--
of
the
federal
rules
that
that
isn't
the
whole
statute.
the
respondents
pretend
that
it
is
separate,
distinct,
and
that
it
was
intended
to
be
separate
and
distinct,
but
it's
not.
you
look
at
the
bill,
boom-boom,
section
1,
section
2.
you
look
at
the
act,
section
1,
section
2.
you
look
at
the
--
the
preferred
sources,
the
--
the
reports
of
the
house,
the
reports
of
the
senate,
and
they
say
clearly,
they're
together,
they're
companion.
one
implements
the
other.
they
go
together.
the
language
of
the
second
section
reflects
the
language
of
the
first
section.
the
first
section
leads
to
the
second
section.
as
a
matter
of
fact
without
the
second
section
you
--
you
couldn't
operate
the
first
section.
they
go
together
like
a
horse
and
carriage.
and
this
was
the
holding
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
second
circuit,
that
it
must
be
read
together.
and
that
wasn't
the
first
time
that
a
--
that
a
reputable
court
found
that
it
had
to
be
read
together.
judge
friendly
in
liberation
news,
in
examining
the
history
said,
read
it
together.
he
said
it,
in
haec
verba,
in
--
in
natural
resources
council
against
tva.
he
said
it
has
to
be
read
together.
the
second
circuit
has
had
some
experience
with
the
statute
and
has
--
and
has
seen
the
efforts
of
certain
advocates
to
--
to
expand
it
to
cover
whatever
situation
arises.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
it
isn't
just
judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit
that's
examined
this
statute.
it
isn't
judge
mulligan
that
has
examined
this
statute.
also
examining
this
statute
has
been
this
court.
and
at
the
same
--
in
the
same
year
that
this
court
decided
bivens,
and
prior
to
that,
this
court
decided
schlanger
against
seamans.
and
again
there
was
--
that
was
a
habeas
corpus
action.
the
locale
was
arizona.
the
--
the
young
man
seeking
habeas
corpus
was
in
arizona.
the
only
problem
was
and
it's
stated
quite
clearly
by
this
court,
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
sole
question
in
the
case
is
whether
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
on
the
merits
petitioner's
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now
--
now,
mr.
justice
douglas
said
that
it
was
--
unless
the
--
the
custodian,
the
necessary
party
in
other
words,
was
--
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
arizona.
they
--
they
couldn't
entertain
the
petition.
all
right.
the
--
the
custodian
was
in
georgia.
the
--
the
superior
officers,
also
alleged
necessary
parties
are
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
--
and
it
was
argued
and
mr.
mel
wulf
was
a
--
a
friend
of
the
court,
more
a
friend
of
the
--
of
mr.
schlanger.
they
argued
that
--
that
the
--
if
the
normal
jurisdiction
would
not
stretch
to
cover
the
custodians
on
some
kind
of
strait
against
laird
notion
that
if
it
wouldn't
stretch,
then
--
then
use
1391
(e),
and
that's
where
the
discovery
was
made
that
1391
(e)
is
a
--
is
a
pretty
good
idea
to
grab
jurisdiction
over
--
over
public
officials.
and
--
and
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
douglas
held
that
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
was
fatal,
and
that
the
1391
(e)
would
not
apply.
why
wouldn't
1391
(e)
apply?
this
court,
with
the
chief
justice
sitting,
black,
brennan,
white,
marshall
and
blackmun
joined,
harlan,
j.,
concurred
in
the
result,
stewart,
j.,
dissenting.
with
that
opinion,
mr.
justice
douglas
said
that
1391
(a)
was
enacted
to
broaden
the
venue
of
civil
actions
which
could
previously
have
been
brought
only
in
the
district
of
columbia
--
only
have
been
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
the
--
the
stafford
case
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia.
tort
actions
in
1962
and
before
could
have
been
brought
anywhere
as
they
were
not
restricted.
and
that
is
a
limitation
on
the
--
the
kind
of
cases
that
can
be
used.
and
it
also
shows
that
--
that
1391
(e),
as
a
venue
statute
is
not
--
does
not
cover
all
civil
actions.
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
but
--
but
that
isn't
a
--
it
doesn't
make
the
difference
there
because
--
because
the
question
is
whether
a
government
official,
that
would
be
the
custodian,
who
was
a
government
official,
united
states
official,
whether
he
could
be
--
he
could
be
reached
in
--
in
georgia,
or
whether
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
could
be
reached
in
--
in
washington,
d.c.
and
--
and
it
--
it
found
that
it
did
not
and
that
quotation
of
footnote
4
doesn't
go
to
--
to
exceptions.
it
--
it
flatly
states
that
--
that
after
looking
at
the
history
that
--
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
those
suits
that
could
not
be
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
that
is
--
is
significant.
in
fact,
that
is
the
recurrent
theme
going
through
the
preferred
sources,
the
--
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report.
i
think
that
--
that
if
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
this
legislation,
you
will
see
that
it
doesn't
provide
for
pocketbook
suits,
whether
they
be
for
$1.5
million
or
$1
billion
or
$100,000.
take
the
house
and
senate
reports,
both
state
what
the
purpose
is.
+and
i
think
everybody
seems
to
jump
over
it
but
it's
important.
it
says,
the
purpose
of
this
bill
--
bill
--
is
to
make
it
possible
to
bring
actions
against
government
officials
and
agencies
in
u.s.
district
courts
outside
the
district
of
columbia,
which,
because
of
certain
existing
limitations
on
jurisdiction
and
venue
may
now
be
brought
only
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
i
also
want
to
call
your
honors
attention
in
connection
with
purpose
to
the
house
report
that
states
unequivocally
that
the
purpose
of
section
1391
(e),
that's
the
second
section,
that
the
purpose
of
1391
(e)
was,
“similar
to
that
of”
section
1361,
which
is
the
first
section.
and
then
the
report
says
--
and
i
think
it's
highly
significant,
and
this
is
at
the
colby
petition
91a,
that
the
new
venue
provision
was
and
now
i'm
quoting,
“designed
to
permit
an
action
which
is
essentially
against
the
united
states
to
be
brought
locally
rather
than
requiring
that
it
be
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
simply
because
washington
is
the
official
residence
of
the
officer
or
agency
sued.”
now,
what
we
have
here
is
respondents
and
the
court
below
turning
the
statute
upside
down.
instead
of
using
the
statute
to
bring
a
suit
locally,
which
could
formerly
have
been
brought
only
in
washington,
d.c.,
respondents
seek
to
bring
an
action
in
washington,
d.c.,
which
could
only
have
been
brought
locally.
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
may
i,
your
honor,
just
a
moment.
the
answer
the
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
to
ms.
peterson
is
no,
it
could
not
bring
before
1962
an
action
of
--
of
this
kind.
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
well,
if
the
question
is
before
1962,
before
1962
actions
--
actions
in
the
nature
--
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
would
have
to
be
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia.
if
the
action
was
a
pocketbook
case,
a
tort
action,
it
would
be
brought
locally
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
after
1962,
you
cannot
reach
the
--
the
petitioners
in
--
om
the
district
of
columbia,
you
cannot
except
if
this
court
upholds
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
peter
megargee
brown
you
could
arguably
come
to
such
a
conclusion.i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
--
that
ms.
peterson
talks
about
unpreferred
sources.
unpreferred
sources
--
what
--
what
the
department
of
justice
may
have
said
or
may
not
have
said,
they're
not
--
they're
not
legislators.
and
what
--
what
katzenbach
said
afterwards,
if
he
did
say
it,
if
he
did
write
that
memorandum,
if
he
did
sign
it,
i
see
no
signature.
i
don't
know
who
wrote
the
katzenbach
memorandum
after
the
--
the
legislation
was
enacted.
these
--
these
are
unpreferred
sources.
the
--
the
real
source
is
--
is
the
latest
report,
the
senate
report.
if
ms.
peterson
had
--
had
looked
at
the
senate
report,
she
would
see
and
--
that
on
page
2785,
which
is
also
sometimes
said
to
be
page
1,
purpose
is
written
out.
and
it
says,
"the
purpose
of
this
bill,
as
amended,
is
to
make
possible
to
bring
actions
against
government
officials
and
agencies
in
the
united
states
district
courts
outside
the
district
of
columbia,
which,
because
of
certain
existing
limitations
on
jurisdiction
and
venue,
may
now
be
brought
only
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.”
nothing
else
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
bill
and
of
the
statute.
and
--
and
her
suit
does
not
come
within
that
purpose.
she
also
does
not
read
to
you
from
a
preferred
source
where
the
senate
report
is
important
because
it
came
out
just
before
the
enactment,
just
a
matter
of
weeks
before
the
enactment.
and
it
says,
“the
bill,
as
amended.”
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
it
was
amended
many
times
and
it
goes
back
to
the
gestation
period
of
five
years.
and
this
is
the
latest
preferred
source.
it
says,
“the
bill,
as
amended,
is
intended
to
facilitate
review
by
the
federal
courts
of
administrative
actions.”
now,
what
has
the
--
the
bivens-type
action
of
these
petitioners,
none
of
whom
live
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
are
trying
to
bring
some
--
some
people
up
from
--
from
florida
to
sue
them
in
their
pocketbooks
for
a
million
point
five,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
an
administrative
action?
if
it
honestly
and
truly
is
an
administrative
action,
it
is
in
essence
against
the
united
states
and
they
may
not
dip
in
those
petitioners'
pockets
for
their
second
mortgage
and
their
tuition
savings
bank
account.
i
mean,
they
have
to
make
up
their
mind.
this
is
a
--
this
is
an
administrative
review
of
mandamus
and
venue
act
and
nothing
more.
and
the
effort
to
extend
it
to
pocketbook
suits
is
--
is
an
effort
to
put
federal
employees
in
a
--
in
a
special
disadvantaged
class.
it's
to
discriminate
against
them
as
you
discriminate
against
nobody
else
in
the
united
states.
pick
out
the
federal
employees
and
you
say
to
them,
"you
can
be
sued
in
nome.
you
can
be
sued
in
maine.
you
can
be
sued
anytime
any
plaintiff
wants
to
sue
you.
and
you
have
to
go
there.
you
have
to
bring
your
witnesses
there.
you
have
to
bring
your
documents
there.
and
if
you're
totally
innocent,
assuming,
you
will
have
two
years
of
the
worst
years
of
your
life."
and
not
only
that
but
you're
sued
in
a
multiplicity
of
suits,
colby,
a
resident
of
maryland,
sued
in
washington,
d.c.,
new
york,
rhode
island.
kipperman
v.
mccone
in
--
in
california,
he's
sued.
all
on
the
same
fact
situation,
mail
opening.
this
is
what
happens,
buffeted
around.
goodwin,
you
mentioned
him.
goodwin,
sued
in
new
york,
sued
in
--
in
washington,
d.c.
now,
the
white
letter
--
the
white
letter,
ms.
peterson
told
this
court,
left
the
statute
broad
after
he
wrote
it.
that's
not
so.
the
--
he
said,
it
should
be
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
to
be
limited.
after
that,
it
was
amended.
it
was
amended
to
be
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
