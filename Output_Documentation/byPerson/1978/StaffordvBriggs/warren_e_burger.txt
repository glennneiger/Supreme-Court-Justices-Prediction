chief
justice
warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
1546,
stafford
against
briggs.
mr.
brown,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
didn't
the
president
have
something
to
say
after
the
bill
was
passed
when
he
signed
it?
of
course,
the
president
can't
make
legislative
history
and
he
can't
make
a
statute
mean
anything
that
the
words
do
not
mean,
but
when
he
signed
the
bill,
he
made
a
statement
that
this,
related
to
actions
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
i
suppose
there
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
were
a
lot
of
slips
between
the
time
the
statute
--
the
bill
is
first
introduced
and
the
time
when
the
president
signs
it,
but
at
least
that
suggests
what
the
president
thought
what
he
was
signing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
brown.
mrs.
peterson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and,
i
take
it,
there's
no
real
property
involved
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
president
kennedy's
opinion
of
what
the
statute
was
meant
to
be?
is
that
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
opinion
that
mr.
kennedy,
president
--
the
late
president
kennedy,
expressed
the
day
he
signed
the
bill
when
he
said
it
was
a
mandamus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
emphasis
on
the
congressman
who
introduced
it
brings
it
up
again,
to
my
mind,
that
president
kennedy,
as
all
presidents,
is
one
of
the
essential
components
of
the
legislative
process.
he
added
to
the
confusion,
perhaps,
by
saying
what
he
thought
he
was
signing
that
day.
now,
if
he
mistakenly
s
--
if
he
was
mistaken,
of
course,
what
he
signed
is
more
important
than
what
he
thought
he
was
signing,
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
an
element
in
the
total
legislative
history,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
he
and
mr.
kennedy
didn't
get
on
the
same
wavelength
at
some
point?[attempt
to
laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
colby
against
driver.
mr.
nemser,
i
believe
you
can
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
nemser
before
you
go
on,
you
said
92
(a)
of
your
cert
petition.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that
has
what
i
thought
mr.
justice
stevens
was
inquiring
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
isn't
--
doesn't
purport
to
be
quoted,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
this
is
all
quoted
from
90
(a)
onwards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
it
you're
looking
at?
give
us
the
page.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
not
the
last
sentence
of
that
94
(a)
paragraph
somewhat
important
here?
“there
is
no
intention,”
this
is
the
committee
speaking,
i
take
it,
“to
alter
the
venue
requirements
of
federal
law
insofar
as
suits
resulting
from
the
official's
private
actions
are
concerned.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
stillman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
making
a
pretty
strong
case
for
not
paying
too
much
attention
to
legislative
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure,
which
is
your
objective?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
category
do
you
put
the
president's
observations
about
the
bill?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
put
it
in
your
--
as
an
appendix
to
your
brief,
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
wulf.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
you
say
“to
and
from
the
united
states,”
i
suppose
there's
a
great
deal
more
than
250,000
letters
over
even
a
year,
wouldn't
there
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
was
focused
in
certain
places,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
process
could
be
followed
constitutionally
during
war
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
inquiry
on
this
was
to
further
ask,
what
provision
of
the
constitution,
if
as
you
implied,
it
might
be
valid
in
war
time,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
would
render
it
valid
during
war
time
and
render
it
invalid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
not
a
constitutional
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
not
a
constitutional
re
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
the
hypothesis,
mr.
wulf,
as
to
what
was
in
president
kennedy's
mind
or
in
the
mind
of
the
person
who
wrote
his
statement
on
the
signing
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
illusive
enough
subject
for
lawyers,
and
is
there
a
reasonable
basis
for
presumption
that
president
kennedy
did
not
sit
down
with
his
pen
and
think
this
whole
thing
up
on
his
own?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
best,
all
it
shows
that
--
is
that
we
have
legislative
history
which
is
perhaps
more
confused
than
usual,
is
it
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unreasonable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
because
the
present
policy
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
at
least
inferentially
endorsed
by
the
appropriations
committees,
but
that
policy
might
change.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
department
of
justice
has
had
a
variable
policy
on
representing
committees
of
the
congress,
for
example.
sometimes
they
do,
sometimes
they
don't
represent
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
are
always
more
burdens
on
the
moving
party,
the
initiating
party
than
on
the
responding
party
in
terms
of
burden
of
proof
and
a
whole
lot
of
other
things,
aren't
there?
the
party
who
initiates
carries
a
large
burden
of
proof
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
expense.
well,
these
things
aren't
really,
except
the
venue
aspect,
who's
paying
the
defendants'
fees
and
who
will
pay
the
judgment
perhaps
is
really
not
relevant
to
the
basic
issue
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
stafford
against
briggs.
mr.
brown,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
peterson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
these
purposes,
it
could
be
seven
different
kinds
of
an
action,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
could
be
seven
other
different
kinds
of
actions
for
the
purposes
of
the
legal
question
that's
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
quite
clear
when
you
said
the
d.c.
circuit
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
them,
can
you
tell
us
why?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
have
some
bearing
on
whether
damage
actions
were
included?
what
--
what
was
the
court's
purpose
in
excising
out,
excluding,
the
former
officials?
was
it
because
there
wasn't
anything
they
could
do
in
terms
of
mandamus-type
relief
or
injunctive
relief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
could
have
eliminated
that
with
just
a
few
words,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
well,
it
cuts
the
other
way,
too.
congress
could
have
made
it
expressly
to
include
damage
actions.
it
could
have
made
it
to
include
all
types
of
actions,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
brown?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
another
factor,
if
he'd
been
promoted
from
deputy
attorney
general
to
attorney
general,
what
could
be
the
situation?
he
was
sued
--
if
a
suit
was
originally
for
actions
as
deputy
attorney
general,
and
later
he'd
been
promoted,
would
that
be
the
same
as
going
over
to
a
district
judgeship
for
these
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
has
expired
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
mr.
brown.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
colby
and
walters
against
driver.
mr.
nemser,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
stillman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
by
the
government
you
read
that
as
meaning
the
particular
governmental
official
who
had
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
done
something
that
was
thought
he
should
not
have
done,
or
she
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wulf?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
--
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
wulf,
that
there
would
be
no
violation
opening
at
the
border?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
--
any
given
attorney
general
can
terminate
that
arrangement
any
time
he
wants,
can't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
far
as
we
know,
the
attorney
general
might
do
nothing
for
them
after
any
given
day.
there
have
been
times
when
the
attorney
general
has
refused
to
represent
in
a
setting
like
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
new,
mr.
wulf,
about
the
idea
that
plaintiffs
in
lawsuits
have
greater
burdens
than
the
defendants
at
the
onset?
they
have
the
burden
of
proof,
they
have
the
burden
of
beginning
the
litigation.
that's
--
that's
always
been
true,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
the
time
is
all
consumed.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
thank
you
mrs.
stillman.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
the
united

chief

warren

i

the
disposition

two
related

attorney

the
district
of
