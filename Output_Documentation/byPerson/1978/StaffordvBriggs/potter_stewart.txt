justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
may
be,
and
i
assume
it
is,
all
very
true
so
far
as
the
historic
genesis
of
this
legislation
goes,
but
the
question
is
what
does
the
legislation,
as
an
enacted
not
by
hammer
budge,
but
by
the
entire
congress,
both
houses
of
the
congress,
the
house
and
the
senate,
what
does
it
provide.
and,
1391
(e)
seems,
by
its
literal
terms,
to
go
considerably
farther
than
--
further
than
hammer
budge's
original
proposal,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
said.
i
assume
that
was
his
intention.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
really,
mr.
brown,
that
the
heart
of
the
respondents'
case
are
those
two
rather
arid
sentences
in
the
midway
in
the
committee
reports
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
or,
rather,
isn't
the
heart
of
the
respondents'
case
the
plain
language
of
the
statue
as
well
as
what
the
deputy
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
told
the
committees
the
statute
meant?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
three
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
lawrence
walsh,
lauren
white,
and
nicholas
katzenbach.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
deputy
attorney
general
white?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
they
enacted
this
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
quoting
the
attorney
general
or
are
you
speaking
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
that
disjunctive
phrase
that
you
stated.
it's
kind
of
--
it's
duchesne,
upon
which
reliance
is
had
or
under
color
of
legal
authority?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
cert
petition?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
left
out
the
“not
only.”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
might
not
have
been
allowed
to
cry
if
you're
correct
in
your
submission
that
these
cases
were
very
rare
in
1962?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
memorandum
referred
to
in
the
footnote
34
of
your
amicus
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
in
which,
you
say
at
the
conclusion
that
the
best
explanation
of
this
memorandum
is
that
it's
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
be
surprised
if
you
weren't.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
it's
on
page
48.
justice
potter
stewart
2255.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
mean
the
decision
in
schlanger
is
necessarily
wrong.
you're
talking
about
the
accuracy
of
that
footnote.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
because
of
his
first
explanation.
justice
potter
stewart
form
--
on
a
basis
of
then-deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach's
note
to
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget,
whose
name
in
those
days
was
belle.
i
guess,
his
name
still
is
belle,
but
there's
a
different
director
of
the
budget
saying
“accordingly,
we
suggest
that
the
president
may
wish
to
issue
an
announcement
at
the
time
he
signs
the
bill,
making
it
clear
that
he
considers
the
limited
purpose
controlling
them.
that's
in
page
48
of
the
government's
brief
indicating
pretty
definitely
where
the
president's
statement
came
from.
justice
potter
stewart
so
long
as
it's
inside
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
another
very
good
explanation
why
1391
(e)
wasn't
applicable
in
the
schlanger
case
and
that
is
that
1391
(e)
by
its
own
terms
provides
this
venue,
as
it
says,
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
law.
and
in
the
habeas
corpus,
is
limited
by
law
to
the
venue
of
the
custodial
officer,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
merits
of
this
case
aren't
before
us
at
all,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
the
merits
of
this
case
aren't
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
the
present
participle,
acting.
justice
potter
stewart
the
katzenbach
memorandum
came
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
shortly
afterwards,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
in
this
case,
do
the
plaintiffs
live
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
so
under
what
--
which
criterion
of
the
statute
was
this
suit
brought?
justice
potter
stewart
a
defendant
in
the
action?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
was
amended
in
1976,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
most
importantly
to
provide
for
service
upon
additional
persons
but
also
--
and
i'm
reading
now
from
the
first
circuit
opinion
in
the
driver
against
helms
case,
"each"
was
changed
to
"a".
justice
potter
stewart
which
"each",
do
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
the
first
line
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute
that
was
amended?
justice
potter
stewart
a
civil
action
in
which
each
defendant
is
an
officer,
was
changed
to,
a
civil
action
in
which
a
defendant
is
an
officer?is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
in
1976.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
then
they
added
provisions?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
judge
mulligan's
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
used
--
inserted
the
word
"only,"
too,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach
wrote
that
memorandum
to
the
district
attorneys,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he
did
after
--
after
the
statute
was
enacted
sent
another
memorandum?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
was
the
previous
congress,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
the
congress
that
enacted
this
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
well
otherwise
provided
by
law,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean,
otherwise
provided
by
statutory
law,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
a
--
and
how
about
the
last
sentence
in
footnote
4
in
the
schlanger
opinion?
i
read
it
this
morning.
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
justice
potter
stewart
or
in
civil
actions
or
just
generally?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
special
rules
of
law
governing
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
he
also
wrote
schlanger
as
we
know.
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
know,
i
dissented
in
schlanger,
so
that
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
due
process
is
applicable
only
when
we're
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
and
this
--
we're
dealing
here
with
the
venue
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
as
you
suggested
in
your
answer
to
my
brother
rehnquist
about
the
security's
legislation,
venue
under
those
laws
must
be
in
several
alternative
places.
justice
potter
stewart
but
jurisdiction
is
nationwide,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
to
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
--
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
jurisdiction
is
not
the
same
as
venue,
that's
what
--
that
was
my
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
point
of
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that's
dealt
with
in
note
8
of
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
5
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
opening
mail
at
the
border.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
district
court,
i
thought
that
you
successfully
made
the
claim
that
the
test
was
whether
or
not
he
was
a
government
officer
at
the
time
that
the
cause
of
action
arose.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
that
was
--
that
part
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
did
not
grant
certiorari
on
that
question,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
since
when?
since
when
was
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitution
applies
to
everybody
in
the
united
states
of
america.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
the
fifteenth
amendment,
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joined.
