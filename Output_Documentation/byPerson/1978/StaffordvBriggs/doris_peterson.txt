ms.
doris
peterson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
civil
damage
action
against
four
federal
officials.
they
are
charged
with
a
conspiracy
to
deny
plaintiffs'
constitutional
rights
by
a
course
of
conduct
which
included
the
commission
of
perjury
and
the
cover
up
thereof.
this
case
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
the
district
where
defendant
goodwin
resides.
he
was
served
by
--
personally
in
that
district.
the
three
petitioners
here
reside
in
florida.
they
are
charged
as
co-conspirators.
they
are
--
ms.
doris
peterson
if
there's
no
real
property
involved
in
the
action.
ms.
doris
peterson
no.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that's
one
of
the
four
places
that
congress
provided.
it
was
where
the
plaintiffs
reside,
where
the
defendant
resides,
where
the
real
property
is,
or
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
the
three
defendants
who
are
the
petitioners
here
are
also
federal
officials.
they
resided
in
florida
where
they
were
served
by
certified
mail
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
28
usc
1391
(e).
it
provides
--
it
provided
in
relevant
part,
at
the
time
that
this
action
was
filed,
a
civil
action
in
which
each
defendant
is
an
officer
or
employee
of
the
united
states
acting
in
his
official
capacity
or
under
color
of
legal
authority,
may
be
brought
in
any
judicial
district
in
which
a
defendant
in
the
action
resides.
it
also
provided
that
the
delivery
of
the
summons
and
complaint
to
the
officer
may
be
made
by
certified
mail
beyond
the
territorial
limits
of
the
district
court
in
which
the
action
is
filed.
this
case
fits
exactly
within
the
statute.
it
is
a
civil
action
in
which
each
defendant,
at
the
time
he
committed
the
acts
complained
of,
was
a
--
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
mr.
--
ms.
doris
peterson
the
statute
--
ms.
doris
peterson
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
says
“acting
--
ms.
doris
peterson
in
his
official
capacity
or
under--
ms.
doris
peterson
they've
all
continued
to
act
in
their
official
capacity
and
we're
suing
them,
both
in
their
official
capacity
and
individual.
ms.
doris
peterson
no.
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
but
he
was
still
the
united
states
prosecutor
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed.
ms.
doris
peterson
they
were
all
in
those
same
positions
at
that
time.
ms.
doris
peterson
the
other
jobs
that
they
have,
have
been
jobs
that
they've
taken
subsequently.
mr.
carrouth,
as
one
of
the
petitioners,
left
government
service
and
is
now
in
private
practice.
but,
at
the
time
we
served
him
--
ms.
doris
peterson
--
he
was
the
assistant
us
attorney.
ms.
doris
peterson
it
said
“each
defendant,”
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
we
filed
this
suit.
it
was
amended
in
1976.
you'll
see
that
in
the
footnote
to
the
statute
in
our
brief.
in
1976,
they
changed
it
to
“a
defendant”
because
some
courts
were
interpreting
it
to
mean
that
if
they
were
non-federal
officials
as
defendants,
the
1391
(e)
would
not
apply.
this
action
was
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
defendant
goodwin
resides.
as
the
statute
allowed
us
to
do,
we
served
the
petitioners
by
certified
mail.
as
the
court
below
properly
found
the
statutory
mandate
covers
this
case.
what
this
case
is
about
is
that,
despite
the
clear
language
of
the
statute,
petitioners
asked
the
court
to
read
the
words
“a
civil
action”
as
meaning
“a
civil
action
other
than
a
damage
action.”
the
flaw
in
petitioners'
argument
is
not
only
that
it
ignores
the
statutory
language,
but
also
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history.
the
legislative
--
ms.
doris
peterson
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
goes
to
the
confusion
which
comes
when
you
try
to
follow
petitioners'
approach
because
two
statutes
were
enacted
at
the
same
time,
1361
and
1391
(e).
the
part
about
“previously
brought
only
in
the
district
of
columbia”
refers
to
1361
which
was
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
statute.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
let
me
explain
that
case
a
little
further
because
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
did
not
have
the
advantage
of
briefing
on
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute.
there
is
one
small
paragraph
in
the
government
brief
on
the
legislative
history,
and
the
--
it's
just
a
reference
to
the
house
report.
there
is
nothing
else
in
any
of
the
briefs
in
schlanger
about
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute.
furthermore,
s
--
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
i
also
believe
that
habeas
is
a
different
proceeding,
if
you
go
on
with
that
footnote
because
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
but
the
court
did
not
have
the
advantage
of
many
of
the
documents
which
have
since
become
available
which
were
not
available
at
the
time.
things
like
the
hearings
were
not
yet
typed
up,
and
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
monell,
last
year,
this
court
re-examined
the
history
of
a
statute
where
it
had
more
material
available
to
it
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
finds
that
that's
inconsistent
with
the
approach
that
we
take,
they
should
re-examine
it
in
view
of
the
totality
of
the
legislative
history
which
is
now
available.
also,
the
court
at
--
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
memorandum
from
the
department
of
justice,
nicholas
d.b.
katzenbach's
memorandum,
was
not
available
until
after
the
decision
in
our
case
when
it
was
submitted
as
part
--
it
was
lodged
with
the
court
as
part
of
a
petition
for
rehearing.
the
hearings
below
had
never
been
published
and
they
were
also
made
available
after
the
decision
in
our
case,
about
three
weeks
before
the
decision
--
the
argument
before
the
first
circuit
in
the
driver
case.
ms.
doris
peterson
which
opinion,
your
honor?
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
as
to
that,
that
incidentally
was
recommended
by
the
same
mr.
katzenbach
who
wrote
the
memorandum
which
said
that
damage
actions
were
covered.
and,
he
did
that
because
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
carefully,
you'll
see
that
the
justice
department
was
very
concerned
that
this
sta
--
that
1361
would
be
interpreted
to
involve
the
discretionary
acts
of
high
level
cabinet
officials,
and
they
didn't
want
it
so
interpreted.
so,
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
it
would
not
include
more
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
1361
is
a
subject
matter
statute,
1391
(e)
deals
with
problems
of
venue
and
personal
jurisdiction.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
it's
consistent
with
our
position
and,
if
it
weren't,
it
wouldn't
affect
the
legislative
history
bec--
ms.
doris
peterson
i
don't
think
presidents
have
a
thing
called
the
item
veto.
i
think
a
president
has
various
options.
one
is
to
sign
legislation,
two,
is
to
veto
it,
or,
three,
he
can
veto
it
and
send
it
back
and
say
“i'll
sign
it
in
this
form,”
but
i
really
don't
think
that
it
is
important
as
far
as
our
position
is
concerned
because
i
think
that
what
president
kennedy
said
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
purposes
that
we
are
suggesting
here.
there
were
several
purposes
to
the
bill,
some
related
to
1361
and
some
related
to
1391
(e).
and,
in
order
to
make
all
of
it
consistent,
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
these
purposes,
otherwise,
you
get
in
the
position
that
petitioners
are
wanting
us
to
ignore
certain
parts
of
the
legislative
history
and
saying
that
they're
confusing
or
that
this
part
of
it
is
wrong.
ms.
doris
peterson
mr.
justice
douglas
who
wrote
that
opinion
went
on
in
the
footnote
to
note
that
habeas
is
a
unique
proceeding.
he
cited
the
harris
case.
ms.
doris
peterson
and
said
that
ordinary
civil
rules
do
not
apply
in
a
har
--
in
habeas
and,
also,
that
it
was
a
jurisdictional
matter
which
is
controlled
by
28
usc
2241
in
habeas
power.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
well
--
ms.
doris
peterson
there
is
a
provision
in
the
statute,
in
1391
(e),
“except
as
otherwise
provided
by
law”
and
we
maintain
that
habeas
is
“as
otherwise
provided
by
law.”
it's
provided
in
the
habeas
statute
which
limits
jurisdiction
of
district
courts
in
habeas
proceedings
and,
therefore,
that
it
is
consistent
to
maintain
the
schlanger
footnote.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
overrule
it
if
it
doesn't
want
to,
and
still
take
the
position
which
we
are
asking
for
here
which
is
in
ordinary
civil
proceedings
that
1391
(e)
applies
without
restrictions.
ms.
doris
peterson
the
diversity
section
or
the
--
now
the
federal
question
section
--
ms.
doris
peterson
--
which,
has
long
applied,
yes,
and
it
could've
been
brought
under
that.
only,
under
that
section,
we
could
not
have
gotten
a
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
defendants
and
we
needed
1391
(e)
and
its
provisions
for
personal
service,
which
the
paragraph
we
could
serve
them
by
certified
mail
in
order
to
get
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
florida
defendants
in
this
suit.
and
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
the
defendants
in
this
case
all
moved,
including
the
defendant
goodwin,
for
a
change
of
venue
to
florida.
they
made
a
1404
(a)
motion,
and
the
district
court
denied
that
motion,
that's
a
motion
in
the
interest
of
justice.
and,
he
looked
at
the
equities
in
the
case
and
denied
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue,
and
we
are
now
actively
litigating
this
suit
in
the
district
court
against
the
defendant
goodwin.
we're
in
the
process
of
discovery.
ms.
doris
peterson
not
over
defendant
goodwin.
we
had
--
we
could've
sued
him
in
–
with
--
totally
without
1391
(e)
in
the
district
of
columbia.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
well
one
of
them
is
a
federal
district
judge
now
and
where
they
were
very
influential
in
their
community.
congress
gave
plaintiffs
a
choice
of
forum.
we
chose
a
neutral
form
in
which
to
bring
this
suit
and
we
are
suing
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
--
ms.
doris
peterson
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
if
i
gave
that
impression,
i
did
not
mean
that
we
could
not
have
brought
a
suit
in
florida.
we
could
have
sued
the
defendants
in
florida.
we
chose
to
use
the
choice
of
forum
which
congress
gave
to
citizens
when
they're
litigating
for
abuse
of
government
power
by
government
officials.
congress
gave
citizens
that
choice.
that's
why
they
passed
this
statute.
that's
what
the
legislative
history
is
full
of.
ms.
doris
peterson
congressman
budge
had
one
intention
when
he
introduced
this
statute,
but
congressman
budge
was
only
one
of
the
congress
people
in
the
whole
process.
in
the
course,
the
bill
that
he
introduced
would
not
have
permitted
this
suit,
but
the
bill
went
through
an
evolutionary
change
in
the
course
of
its
legislative
history.
we
set
out
on
page
62
of
our
brief
the
changes
that
were
made
after
the
hearings.
after
mr.
macguineas
told
them
that
if
they
added
the
“under
color
of
law”
language
it
would
mean
that
the
defendant
would
pay
out
of
his
own
pocket
and,
after
being
warned
about
that
and
told
that
that's
what
it
would
mean,
they
added
that
language.
ms.
doris
peterson
but
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
was
talking
about
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
courts,
and
we
do
not
maintain
that
1391
(e)
added
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
and,
also,
deputy
attorney
general
white,
in
his
letter,
you
will
see
when
he
talks
about
1391
(e),
that
section
of
the
bill,
he
says
it
deals
with
the
entirely
different
subject,
different
from
1361,
from
the
first
section
of
the
bill
which
became
1361.
ms.
doris
peterson
the
purposes
of
the
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
the
second
paragraph
there,
your
honor?
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
except
that
there
were
several
purposes
and
this
is
one
of
the
--
ms.
doris
peterson
it
says
it
is
generally
made
by
an
official
residing
in
the
district
of
columbia,
but
in
passing
this
legislation,
congress
was
concerned
with
citizens
all
over
the
country
and
wherever
the
decisions
were
being
made
and
that
the
citizen
would
have
the
choice
--
would
make
--
they
would
make
government
officials
amenable
in
four
different
places.
on
page
11
(a),
if
you
will
go
on,
your
honor,
it
says
the
pending
bill
would
pace
--
place
venue
in
any
judicial
district
wherein
the
plaintiff
resides.
and
then,
they
--
he
was
concerned
about
such
a
general
grant
of
venue
and
he
made
some
recommendations
as
to
how
the
plaintiff's
choice
should
be
limited.
congress
listened
to
him
and
they
narrowed
it,
and
they
did
not
allow
it
to
be
wherever
the
plaintiff
resided.
they
only
allowed
it
to
be
where
the
plaintiff
resided
if
no
real
property
was
involved.
they
were
listening
very
carefully
to
the
opinions
that
were
coming
from
the
department
of
justice
and
responding
to
them,
but
they
did
not
react
to
the
opinion
from
deputy
attorney
general
white
that
they
should
tie
this
in
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
in
order
to
eliminate
money
damages,
we
get
back
to
the
question
which
was
raised
earlier
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
by
mr.
justice
stewart
about
the
difference
in
the
wording
of
the
two
bills.
the
two
sections
of
the
bill
--
ms.
doris
peterson
but
the
bill
does
not
put
in
the
restriction
that
limits
it
to
--
limits
and
eliminates
suits
out
of
his
pocketbook.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
was
warned
as
to
what
the
language
would
mean.
ms.
doris
peterson
this
group
of
people
is
in
a
unique
situation.
ms.
doris
peterson
and
one
of
the
things
w
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
one
of
the
things
which
cong
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
one
of
the
things
which
congress
considered
was
that
there
would
be
free
representation
in
these
cases
that
the
department
of
justice
was
all
over
the
country
and
would
be
defending
these
suits,
which
they
have
been
doing
in
this
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
they
gave
free
representation
on
--
ms.
doris
peterson
well,
mr.
justice
mar
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
they
are.
the
justice
department's
attorneys
acted
in
this
suit
up
until
the
point
where
a
petition
for
certiorari
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
and
then
what--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
they
are,
mr.
justice
marshall.
they
are
paying
his
fees
and
expenses
as
they
do
in
all
of
these
cases
when
government
officials
are
sued
out
of
their
pocket
for
acts
that
are
beyond
the
scope
of
their
duties,
but
in
connection
with
their
office.
now,
if
a
government
official
gets
sued
privately
for
private
acts,
they
don't
represent
him.
but
--
ms.
doris
peterson
does
the
--
i'm
sorry?
ms.
doris
peterson
no
--
that's
down
the
road,
but
we
are
suing
to
obtain
a
judgment
from
the
defendants
individually,
out
of
their
pockets.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
i
--
there
was
a
series
of
events
in
the
legislative
history.
five
crucial
events,
which
are
all
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
which
i
do
not
have
time
to
go
through.
there's
the
first
letter
from
the
department
of
justice
making
congress
aware
of
the
problem.
there
were
the
hearings
in
which
damage
actions
were
extensively
discussed.
they
were
very
concerned
about
damage
actions
because
barr
v.
matteo
had
just
come
down
and
though
it
talked
about
a
scope
of
immunity.
it
talked
about
also
the
outer
perimeters
of
it
and
they
knew
that
there
could
be
such
suits
beyond
the
perimeters.
and,
also
--
then
there
was
a
redrafted
bill
in
which
they
added
the
very
language
which
they
were
warned
about,
the
“under
color
of
law”
language,
and
they
put
in
the
house
report
that
their
problem
arises
in
damage
actions
seeking
damages
from
him,
from
the
government
official,
not
from
the
government,
but
from
him
for
actions
which
are
claimed
to
be
beyond
the
scope
of
the
authority.
then,
there
was
the
second
department
of
justice
letter
from
then
deputy
attorney
general
byron
white
and
the
senate
report
which
put
in
again
that
paragraph
about
seeking
damages
from
him,
from
the
government
official,
and
then
we
got
the
department
of
justice
acknowledgment
that
damage
actions
were
covered,
written
by
the
then
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach
who
also
advised
the
president
to
issue
that
statement
so
as
to
be
sure
that
the
powers
of
the
cabinet
were
not
interfered
with.
we
will
not
have
time
to
deal
with
the
issue
as
to
personal
jurisdiction.
on
that
issue,
i'd
just
like
to
say,
very
briefly,
that
we
got
personal
jurisdiction
by
a
combination
of
two
things,
rule
4
(f)
which
permits
service
beyond
the
territorial
limits
of
a
state
when
a
statute
so
authorizes
it,
and
1391
(e)
is
the
statute
which
authorized
it.
and,
we
also
will
not
deal
with
the
petitioners'
due
process
claims,
but
i
just
want
to
say
on
that
that
the
government
has
conceded
that
the
court
below
was
right
on
this
issue
and
petitioners
have
conceded
that
this
court's
decisions
in
the
international
shoe
co.
line
of
cases
do
not
apply
to
the
extraterrito
--
those
cases
which
deal
with
the
extraterritorial
assertion
of
powers
by
states
beyond
its
borders
are
not
applicable
here
where
congress
is
using
its
power
within
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states.
congress
has
legislated
to
allow
service
of
process
on
a
nationwide
basis
as
is
done
in
other
statutes.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
and
in
hawaii,
but
--
and
in
alaska,
but
they
are
now
states
of
the
union
and--
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
did,
your
honor,
and
it
was
an
error.
i
include,
within
that,
all
states.
it
does
not
apply
in
the
canals
zone.
there's
been
interpretation
to
that
effect.
this
court
has
recognized
it
in
mississippi
publishing
corporation,
united
states
against
union
pacific
railroad,
robertson,
and
toland
that
nationwide
service
of
process
is
something
that
congress
can
authorize,
and
congress
did
here.
and,
we
submit
that
petitioners'
argument
about
fair
play
and
substantial
justice
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
argument.
here,
the
--
in
shaffer,
this
fairness
which
is
discussed
there
relates
to
the
fairness
that
exercise
of
power
by
a
particular
sovereign
and,
here,
the
sovereign
has
exercised
its
power.
petitioners
are
complaining
about
the
great
burden
of
litigating,
but
they
have
been
represented
either
by
the
department
of
justice
or
by
free
counsel
since
this
litigation
began,
and
petitioners
admi
--
have
not
yet
once
had
to
appear
in
a
court
proceeding.
and,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
earlier
about
what
they
can
do
pretrial,
they
can
make
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
and
have
that
considered
--
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
the
department
of
justice
does
it
for
them
in
these
cases.
ms.
doris
peterson
at
the
hearings,
the
department
of
justice
represented
to
assure
congress
that
free
representation
has
been
provided
in
these
beyond-scope
suits
to
justice
--
government
officials
for
over
100
years
and
they
have
been
continuing
to
give
the
representation.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
and
congress
can
decide
to
change
the
statute,
too.
after
--
that
can
be
another
debate
between
the
department
of
justice
and
congress,
but
at
the
moment,
congress
has
decided
that
suits
against
government
officials
are
possible
in
these
four
places.
ms.
doris
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
would
you
repeat
that
question?
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
i
don't
think
that's
controlling.
i
think
what
is
controlling
is
what
congress
did.
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
it
doesn't.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
it
was
in
all
three
bills.
there
were
two
house
bills
--
ms.
doris
peterson
two
house
reports,
i'm
sorry.
two
house
reports
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
within
all
of
the
reports
themselves,
there
is
a
paragraph
which
says
the
venue
problem
also
arises
in
an
action
against
a
government
official
seeking
damages
from
him
for
actions
which
are
claimed
to
be
without
legal
authority
but
which
were
taken
by
official
in
the
course
of
performing
his
duty,
and
that
paragraph
was
left
into
the
senate
report.
it
was
in
both
house
reports
and
senator
mansfield
inserted
it
in
the
congressional
record
at
the
time
that
the
bill
was
passed.
there
was
no
question
that
congress
clearly
knew
that
damage
actions
were
within
the
coverage
of
the
bill.
they
were
pulled
there
by
the
white
letter
right
before
the
bill
was
passed
and
they
chose
not
to
limit
the
statute
and
tie
it
into
the
administrative
procedure
act.
ms.
doris
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
civil
rights
damage
action
for
perjury
and
conspiracy
to
cover
up
and
commit
perjury.
it
is
not
merely
that
the
petitioners
and
mr.
goodwin
are
charged
with
dissembling.
ms.
doris
peterson
pardon
--
no
--
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
merits
are
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
ms.
doris
peterson
i
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice?
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
as
this
court
has
already
been
told,
the
significant
development
in
this
case
since
the
last
argument
was
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
blackburn
case.
petitioners
rely
most
heavily
on
that
decision,
but
in
a
way,
respondents
rely
upon
it
also.
we
rely
upon
it
as
making
absolutely
clear
the
importance
of
considering
the
entire
legislative
history,
and
not
merely
part
of
it
in
determining
the
scope
of
section
1391
(e)
for
the
only
way
the
second
circuit
could
have
ruled
as
it
did
was
by
ignoring
critical
parts
of
the
legislative
history.
that
is
the
only
way
that
one
can
--
one
can
conclude
that
section
1391
(e)
does
not
encompass
damages.
this
court
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
three
deputy
attorney
generals
and
a
justice
department
spokesman
addressed
the
--
expressed
themselves
on
the
damage
action
issue.
three
of
them
told
congress
before
the
law
was
passed.
and
that
congress
interacting
with
--
and
responding
to
the
department
selectively
either
adopted
suggestions
from
the
department
of
justice,
changing
the
wording
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
statutes
before
it
or
rejected
the
department's
suggestion.
the
justice
department
was
in
repeated
contact
with
congress,
trying
to
get
congress
to
exclude
damage
actions.
what
the
representatives
of
the
department
of
justice
said
and
the
congressional
reaction
thereto
is
essential
to
a
meaningful
analysis
of
congress'
intent
because
their
statements
to
congress
show
that
congress
was
made
fully
aware
of
the
damage
issue
while
it
was
considering
the
proposed
bill
and
that
congress
was
fully
aware
that
the
proposed
bill
covered
damage
actions.
the
department
of
justice
tried
to
get
congress
not
to
include
damage
actions.
it
told
congress
how
to
avoid
covering
damage
actions,
what
language
to
use
to
avoid
damage
actions.at
least
twice,
congress
rejected
the
department
of
justice
warnings
about
proposed
language
and
employed
language
that
clearly
covered
damage
actions.
now
we
have
the
second
circuit
opinion,
without
a
word,
literally
without
a
word
about
the
communications
from
the
three
deputy
attorney
generals.
this
is
not
applying
legislative
history,
it
is
burying
it.
that
is
what
the
second
circuit
did
and
that
is
what
petitioners
would
have
this
court
do.
an
interesting
thing
about
the
second
circuit
opinion
is
that
it
noted
that
the
department
of
justice
representative,
mr.
macguineas
had
warned
congress
at
the
hearings
not
to
cover
damage
actions.
he
did
indeed.
but
the
second
circuit
fails
to
mention
that
after
that
warning,
after
mr.
macguineas
told
them
that
if
they
use
the
language
under
color
of
law
they
would
be
covering
out-of-pocket
suits.
the
bill
was
redrafted
by
the
house
committee
and
that
exact
language
was
inserted.
we
start
with
the
statute
which
on
its
face
covers
our
case.
a
civil
action
certainly
includes
a
damage
action.
reading
section
1391
(e)
in
terms
of
its
legislative
history
does
not
mean
reading
the
legislative
history
selectively
to
ignore
all
the
portions
of
the
legislative
history
which
establish
that
congress
intended
to
cover
damage
actions.
when
it
chose
language
for
the
statute
that
encompassed
damage
actions
and
which
it
had
been
told
encompassed
damage
actions.
the
--
ms.
doris
peterson
i
--
i
think
that
there
are
slight
differences
between
them
but
i
think
that
they
both
read
the
statute
together
with
the
legislative
history.
of
course,
the
first
circuit
had
the
benefit
of
the
hearings
which
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
didn't
have.
also,
the
first
circuit
had
the
benefit
of
mr.
katzenbach's
memorandum
which
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
didn't
have
because
neither
of
them
had
been
revealed
until
after
the
district
of
columbia
decision.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
argument
and
the
decision
before
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
no
one
knew
of
the
availability
of
those
hearings.
the
justice
department
presented
them
to
the
first
circuit
about
--
i
believe
it
was
about
three
weeks
before
the
argument
in
the
driver
case,
now
the
colby
case.
also
the
katzenbach
memorandum
was
presented
at
that
time.
the
justice
department
was
then
representing
petitioners
and
they
made
a
petition
for
rehearing
to
the
d.c.
circuit
in
which
they
lodged
with
the
court
the
katzenbach
memorandum.
they
did
not
lodge
the
hearings.
so
the
d.c.
circuit
never
saw
those
two
documents.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
we
did
not
in
this
case
have
the
issue
of
former
officials.
so
that
aspect
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
they
--
they
excluded
former
officials,
that's
correct,
and
of
course
the
court
did
not
grant
cert
on
that
issue.
ms.
doris
peterson
the
former
officials
were
excluded,
i
believe,
because
they
felt
that
they
were
not
included
in
the
legislative
history.
but
even
a
literal
reading
might
exclude
them
because
it
says,
is
an
official.
and
all
of
our
people
were
officials
at
the
time
that
we
brought
this
action.
two
of
them
have
since
transferred
into
other
jobs.
one
is
a
united
states
district
judge.
but
they
were
officials.
and
it
says
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
it
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
at
this
point,
the
d.c.
circuit
in
another
case
has
also
excluded
former
officials.
but
it
believes
that
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
oh,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
also
have
not
worked
on
the
issue
of
former
officials
and
have
not
really
thought
through
that
issue
because
of
the
fact
that
the
court
did
not
grant
cert
on
the
issue.
if
you
want
my
opinion
on
that,
i
think
former
officials
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
but
the
statute
does
say,
"is
an
official."
reading
section
1391
(e)
in
terms
of
its
legislative
history
does
not
mean
reading
the
legislative
history
selectively
to
ignore
those
portions
of
the
legislative
history
that
establish
that
congress
chose
language
for
this
statute
that
encompassed
damage
actions
and
which
it
had
been
told
would
not
encompass
damage
actions.
the
justice
department
communications
are
vital
to
an
understanding
of
the
evolution
of
the
law
because
they
reveal
that
congress
was
made
aware
of
the
damage
actions
and
deliberately
acted
to
cover
such
suits
in
the
language
it
selected
and
in
the
language
it
rejected.
obviously
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
it
could
have,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
could
have
said
--
ms.
doris
peterson
--
"except
in
damage
actions.
after
it
became
aware
of
the
problem
it
was
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
but
congress
chose
words
for
that
statute
which
are
the
same
as
the
words
congress
chose
for
1391
(a)
and
(b)
for
example,
which
says,
all
civil
actions.
and
all
civil
actions
in
those
two
statutes
clearly
encompasses
damage
action.
and
then
when
congress
got
to
1361,
it
chose
different
language.
it
said,
"in
mandamus
type
actions."
so
congress
knew
how
to
exclude
damage
actions
if
it
wanted
to.
it
knew
how
to
draw
a
narrow
statute.
and
it
had
warnings
about
the
language,
the
warnings
in
the
white
letter,
which
made
a
suggestion
as
to
what
language
to
use
that
would
exclude
damage
actions.
and
it's
clear
that
--
that
congress
did
not
select
that
language.
it
chose
language
that
the
justice
department
spokesperson
had
told
them
would
cover
out-of-pocket
cases.
obviously,
respondents
are
not
relying
on
the
katzenbach
memorandum
standing
alone.
however,
it
was
a
culmination
of
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
it
did,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
came
shortly
after
--
ms.
doris
peterson
--
the
statute
was
--
was
enacted.
but
the
katzenbach
memorandum
is
a
culmination
of
the
interaction
of
congress
and
the
department
of
justice
over
the
legislation
during
a
period
of
two
and
a
half
years.
it
was
a
final
acknowledgement
by
the
department
of
justice
that
it
had
failed
to
convince
congress
not
to
cover
damage
actions
and
that
a
law
had
been
passed
which
encompassed
such
actions.
on
page
2
--
this
is
the
memorandum.
on
page
2
of
the
memorandum,
we
have
the
president's
signing
statement.
this
memorandum
was
sent
to
all
the
u.s.
attorneys
around
the
country.
it
is
divided
into
two
sections.
after
setting
forth
what
the
statute
--
the
two
statutes
were
that
were
passed
and
the
signing
statement.
the
first
section
deals
with
the
question
of
section
1361
and
how
it
only
applies
to
ministerial
duties
and
does
not
apply
to
discretionary
acts.
then
starting
on
page
6,
it
deals
with
section
1391
(e)
and
venue
questions.
and
on
page
7
is
the
acknowledgement
that
1391
(e)
covers
suits
for
damages
against
federal
officials
out-of-their-pocket
suit.
they
were
talking
in
this
memorandum
about
libel
and
slander
suits
because
that's
the
kind
of
suit
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
that's
the
kind
of
suits
that
were
being
talked
about
at
the
hearings.
and
that's
the
kind
of
suits
that
were
available
at
that
time.
ms.

peterson

plaintiffs

blackmun's
earlier
question,
the
case
against
defendant
goodwin
is
proceeding
in
the
district
of
columbia.
depositions
and
discoveries
has
been
done
in
that
case
in
both
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
florida
and
the
--
the
case
is
nearing
trial.
that
is
a
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
it
used
to
read
that
each
defendant
was
a
federal
officer.
and
some
courts
had
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
if
you
had
non-federal
officials
as
defendants,
you
couldn't
use
the
statute.
and
it
was
amended
so
that
you
could
have
non-federal
officials
as
defendants,
but
you
could
use
the
special
service
provisions
to
get
jurisdiction
over
the
non-federal
official.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
that's
correct.
ms.
doris
peterson
and
then
there
was
the
--
the
provision
about
how
you
serve
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
it's
interesting
because
at
the
time
of
that
amendment
three
different
statutes
were
amended.
the
--
congress
was
not
dealing
with
only
one
statute.
they
were
dealing
with
a
variety
of
statutes.
and
it
shows
how
the
legislative
history
of
more
than
one
statute
can
be
dealt
with
in
one
report.
and
it's
done
here.
the
legislative
history
of
1361
and
1391
are
dealt
with
in
the
same
three
reports,
two
from
the
house
and
one
from
the
senate.
but
it
is
possible
to
go
through
and
find
the
themes
of
the
difference
between
when
they
were
talking
about
mandamus-type
actions
which
overlap
both
statutes
and
when
they
were
talking
about
damage
actions
which
dealt
with
only
1391
(e).
and
there
was
legislative
history
on
both.
and
what
the
petitioners
are
trying
to
get
us
to
do
is
to
read
1391
(e)
as
if
it
is
encompassed
by
1361,
as
if
1361
is
referred
to
in
the
statute.
the
congress
had
a
variety
of
purposes.
and
when
mr.
brown
read
to
you
some
of
their
purposes,
he
read
them
inserting
--
without
actually
saying
it,
as
if
congress
was
saying,
only
for
this
purpose.
but
the
"only"
was
not
in
there.
right
before
the
law
was
passed,
senator
mansfield
put
the
senate
report
into
the
congressional
record
and
he
talked
about
the
purposes
of
this
bill.
and
one
of
the
purposes
is
damage
action.
the
paragraph
about
damage
action
against
officials
is
in
all
three
reports.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
he
did.
but
it
was
not
in
the
material
--
ms.
doris
peterson
--
that
he
was
inserting
it
from.
it's
the
way
you
have
to
read
it
--
ms.
doris
peterson
--
in
order
to
exclude
damage
actions.
ms.
doris
peterson
i
think
what
they
--
they
were
thinking
--
i
don't
think
that
they
really
thought
through
the
problem
of
third-party
defendants
because
that
would
go
against
all
the
discussion
that
was
before
them
about
the
damage
actions.
and
what
they
were
trying
to
do
is
encompass
into
one
suit
all
the
various
complaints
that
citizens
might
have
because
of
--
of
the
misworkings
of
government.
they
were
--
this
was
a
--
ms.
doris
peterson
i
found
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
problem
was
ever
brought
to
their
attention.
and
i
think
maybe
if
at
the
time
of
the
legislation
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
there
are
about
five
crucial
examples
which
i
can
run
through
for
you
very
briefly.
one,
there
was
a
letter
from
deputy
attorney
general
walsh
--
ms.
doris
peterson
i
think
it
was
a
libel
and
slander
type
case
that
they
were
primarily
concerned
with
because
barr
v.
matteo
--
ms.
doris
peterson
--
had
recently
come
down
and
they
were
concerned
with
where
the
line
was
going
to
be
drawn.
ms.
doris
peterson
you
could
bring
those
cases
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
i
think
all
the
concentration
at
that
time
was
on
the
libel
and
the
slander
actions.
ms.
doris
peterson
though
--
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
that's
correct.
it
was
first
introduced
in
1958,
and
no
action
was
taken
on
it.
then
it
was
reintroduced
in
1960
and
they
had
the
house
hearings
on
it.
finally
it
--
the
--
then
it
was
redrafted
after
the
warning
and
with
the
language,
and
passed
in
that
form
by
the
house.
then
it
was
essentially
the
senate
who
solicited
the
comments
from
then
deputy
attorney
general
white
who
had
replaced
mr.
walsh.
and
he
sent
in
his
comments
at
that
point
the
--
a
few
months
later,
the
senate
amended
it
on
the
basis
of
mr.
white's
comments.
and
by
that
point,
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach
was
in
office
and
he
wrote
two
letters
to
the
house
managers
with
his
comments
on
it.
his
comments
were
only
addressed
to
1361.
and
then
it
was
passed
in
1962.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
and
in
--
in
between,
a
few
days
after
he
wrote
to
the
floor
managers
of
the
house,
he
wrote
to
the
president
suggesting
that
the
president
issue
the
signing
statement.
ms.
doris
peterson
and
as
we
now
know,
he
sent
him
the
very
statement
that
the
--
the
president
actually
issued.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
then
he
sent
a
memorandum
to
all
u.s.
attorneys.
and
the
sequence
of
this
shows
the
last
communication
we
had
from
the
department
of
justice
about
the
damage
issue
is
in
the
white
letter,
in
which
he
tells
them
how
to
avoid
damage
actions
and
they
do
not
follow
his
advice
but
leaves
the
statute
broad.
then,
as
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach
got
involved,
it
was
clear
that
the
problem
that
the
department
of
justice
was
concerned
about
was
a
problem
which
had
been
raised
in
mr.
white's
letter
to
them
which
was
the
--
the
problem
where
mr.
white
talked
about
the
potential
constitutional
problem
of
separation
of
powers.
it
was
of
--
of
great
moment
to
the
department
of
justice,
this
separation
of
powers
problem,
because
they
were
talking
about
the
exercise
of
discretion,
and
courts
telling
federal
officials
how
to
exercise
their
discretion.
and
this
is
in
connection
with
1361.
ms.
doris
peterson
that's
correct.
ms.
doris
peterson
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
he
was
u.s.
attorney
at
the
time.
all
of
the
defendants
at
the
time
that
we
sued
them
were
still
acting
as
officers
of
the
united
states.
ms.
doris
peterson
yes,
all
the
petitioners
were
still
in
that
capacity.
i
want
to
very
briefly
run
through
the
five
steps
in
the
legislative
process
which
we
feel
are
crucial
to
an
understanding
that
damage
actions
were
covered.
first,
there
was
a
letter
from
deputy
attorney
general
walsh,
which
brought
the
damage
action
issue
to
the
attention
of
congress.
he
didn't
--
ms.
doris
peterson
yes.
ms.
doris
peterson
that
was
the
--
ms.
doris
peterson
it
was
in
1960.
at
--
that
letter
was
in
the
hands
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
when
it
had
its
hearing.
and
he
referred
to
the
existence
of
damage
actions.
he
didn't
talk
about
what
kind
of
damage
actions,
i
don't
know
if
he
was
talking
about
libel
and
slander.
he
--
it
appeared
that
he
was
talking
about
more
than
--
different
types
of
damage
actions
than
just
libel
and
slander
but
he
didn't
specify
but
he
said
that
there
were
damage
actions
against
federal
officials
for
acts
beyond
the
scope
of
their
authority.
then
we
had
the
transcripts
of
the
hearings
in
which
damage
actions
are
talked
about.
we
have
mr.
macguineas
telling
them
not
to
use
"under
color
of
law"
because
that
will
be
out-of-the-pocket.
then
we
have
the
house
committee
redrafting
the
bill,
putting
in
the
language.
and
we
also
at
that
time,
the
house
committee
did
a
report
and
talked
about
the
problem
and
suits
against
the
federal
officials
seeking
damages
from
them,
not
from
the
government,
but
from
them.
and
that
paragraph
is
included
in
all
the
reports.
then
we
have
the
letter
from
deputy
attorney
general
white,
suggesting
the
language
that
they
should
use
alternative
language
that
would
avoid
damage
actions.
and
finally,
after
the
law
is
passed,
we
have
the
katzenbach
memorandum
acknowledging
that
damage
actions
are
covered.
ms.
doris
peterson
could
we
sue
him
in
the
district
of
columbia?
ms.
doris
peterson
not
under
the
--
i
don't
believe
under
the
present
interpretation
of
the
law
by
the
district
of
columbia
that
we
could.
ms.
doris
peterson
because
--
then
he
would
be
a
former
official.
ms.
doris
peterson
but
he
was
not
--
would
--
would
no
longer
be
occupying
the
same
office.
but
--
ms.
doris
peterson
that
--
that
issue
--
ms.
doris
peterson
i
believe
that
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
the
court
didn't
grant
cert
on
or
was
a
hole
left
open
in
the
driver
case.
and
we
haven't
had
that
issue
in
our
case,
but
perhaps
mr.
wulf
can
address
it.
our
position
is
that
there
isn't
any
inconsistency
in
the
legislative
history
between
the
two
lines
of
legislative
history.
in
many
respects,
they
are
dealing
with
the
two
separate
statutes,
claims
of
confusion,
meaninglessness,
inconsistency,
or
whatever
adjective
is
used,
come
up
only
when
one
tries
to
brush
off
the
legislative
history
about
damage
actions
and
ignore
the
fact
that
congress
was
dealing
with
two
separate
issues
and
two
separate
statutes
at
the
same
time.
