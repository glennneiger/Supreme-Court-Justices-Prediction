mr.
peter
megaree
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
this
case
and
colby
v.
driver
set
an
argument
in
tandem.
both
involve
the
question,
“did
congress
intend
in
the
enactment
of
the
mandamus
and
venue
act
of
1962
to
grant
united
states
district
courts
nationwide
personal
jurisdiction
over
federal
officers
and
employees
in
their
private
individual
capacities,
that
is
in
essence,
against
them
for
acts
allegedly
performed
under
color
of
law?”
this
is
a
civil
rights
tort
action
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
alleging
unconstitutional
acts
and
seeking
money
damages
from
the
pocketbooks
of
four
individuals
who
were
and
are
federal
employees.
all
wrongful
acts,
alleged,
took
place
in
florida.
the
defendants
below
are
petitioner
stafford,
a
united
states
attorney
in
the
northern
district
of
florida,
now
united
states
district
judge
in
the
northern
district
of
florida,
petitioner
carrouth,
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
the
northern
district
of
florida,
now
in
private
practice
in
florida,
meadow,
a
federal
fbi
agent
stationed
then
and
now
in
the
northern
district
of
florida,
and
goodwin,
a
trial
attorney
with
the
united
states
department
of
justice
in
washington,
d.c.
plaintiffs
are
10
individuals
called
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
in
tallahassee,
florida
in
1972.
a
majority
of
the
plaintiffs
reside
in
florida.
none
of
the
plaintiffs
reside
in
the
district
of
columbia.
eight
of
the
plaintiffs
were
indicted
in
florida
for
conspiracy
to
riot.
after
trial,
each
was
acquitted.
they
became
known
in
the
press
as
the
gainesville
eight.
goodwin,
who
is
not
a
petitioner
here,
was
the
prosecutor
appointed
as
special
attorney
to
act
in
florida
in
connection
with
this
investigation
in
florida
and
the
trial
in
florida,
out
of
which,
this
case
arose.
now,
the
complaint
below
alleges,
and
there
has
been
no
trial
on
this
issue,
the
complaint
alleges
that
goodwin
lied
when
examined
in
a
course
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings
by
the
presiding
judge
in
connection
with
the
presence
of
government
informants
in
the
--
among
the
subpoenaed
witnesses
in
connection
with
this
investigation.
now,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
petitioners
knew
and
remained
silent
with
regard
to
this
alleged
perjury
and
this
constituted
a
conspiracy
against
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
plaintiffs.
plaintiffs
here
asked
damages
of
1.5
million
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
petitioners.
they
also
asked
for
some
declaratory
rights
and
seek
the
appointment
of
a
special
prosecutor
to
bring
indictments
against
petitioners
and
goodwin.
the
petitioners,
having
no
affiliation
with
the
district
of
columbia,
moved
to
dismiss
insufficiency
of
jur--
personal
jurisdiction,
insufficiency
as
a
process,
improper
venue,
and
ultimately
for
a
transfer
of
venue
to
florida.
the
district
court
judge
denied
the
transfer
of
the
case
to
florida,
but
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
circuit
court
disag
--
columbia
circuit
court
reversed
and
denied
rehearing.
it
held
that
the
petitioners
were
subject
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
solely
because
of
the
use
by
the
plaintiffs
of
the
mandamus
and
venue
act
of
1962,
more
precisely,
1391
(e).
the
court
below
determined,
in
effect
--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that's
quite
right.
the
mandamus
and
venue
act
of
1962
is
comprised
of
19
--
of
1361
which
grants
the
mandamus
writ
to
the
district
courts
and,
as
an
adjunct
and
to
be
read
with
it
and
as
a
part
of
it
is
section
2
which
is
1391
(e).
and,
the
legislative
intent
was
that
section
2
would
have
as
its
purpose
the
same
purpose
as
the
first
section.
they
were
to
re
--
be
read
together
and
judge
friendly
in
natural
resources
against
tva
said
they
must
be
read
together,
the
statute
as
a
whole,
and
it's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
well,
1391
(e)
is
cast
in
terms
of
mandamus.
it
provides
an
officer
who
is,
it
provides
who
is
acting,
is
acting.
it
doesn't
say
who
was
acting.
it
deals
with
ongoing
present
conduct.
it
isn't
a
model
of
clarity,
your
honor,
but
it
does
have
language
in
it
that
has
the
cast
of
mandamus
and
was
intended
so
by
the
congress
in
promulgating
it,
i
submit.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
well,
a
–
they
--
if
they're
read
together,
it
is
necessary
to
be
repetitive.
it
is
cast
in
terms
of
mandamus
and
the
--
and
mandamus,
in
promulgating
it,
they
stated
that
it
would
be
read
with
the
same
purpose
as
mandamus.
and,
the
whole
history
--
both
the
purpose
and
the
history
indicates
that
they
were
meant
to
be
read
together
and,
if
read
together,
they
become
into
perspective.
the
--
our
petition
was
granted
on
january
15.
at
the
same
time,
the
colby
v.
driver
petition,
a
petition
that
i
also
filed,
was
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
was
granted,
raising
for
review
the
same
statutory
issues
involving
venue
and
jurisdiction
and
to
avoid
duplication
with
the
tandem
case.
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
will
make
the
thrust
of
my
very
brief
argument,
one
point
common
to
both
cases
and
that
is
that
the
statutes
simply
does
not
apply
to
respondents'
suit
against
federal
officers
and
employees'
pocketbooks.
my
partner,
mr.
nemser,
in
the
second
case
will
focus
on
the
due
process
point.
now,
basically,
if
your
honors
please,
it
is
the
language,
the
purpose
and
the
history
of
the
statute
involved
here
that
demonstrate
that
congress
did
not
intend
its
application
to
suits
for
money
judgments
against
federal
officers
and
employees.
when
the
statute
is
read
in
its
full
context
with
realization
of
its
purpose,
a
narrow
limited
purpose,
and
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history,
it
becomes
clear
that
congress
did
not
direct
or
intend
coverage
of
personal
tort
damage
actions
as
a
kind
of
the
suit
brought
below.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
suit
that
is
brought
below
by
respondents
didn't
exist
in
1962
and
it
wasn't
established
this
bevins
type
action
until
nine
years
later
in
1971.
now,
respondents
in
the
court
below
misinterpret
the
language,
purpose,
and
history
of
the
statue
as
an
unprecedented
break
with
the
past.
in
proper
perspective,
the
statute
is
not
a
sweeping
general
expansion
of
venue
and
jurisdiction.
their
interpretation
which
was
embraced
by
the
court
below
would
allow
federal
employees
to
become
virtual
shuttlecocks
to
be
hit
repeatedly
in
personal
damage
suits
in
scattered
forms
throughout
the
country
so
long
as
the
acts
complained
of
were
alleged
to
have
been
performed
under
color
of
legal
authority.
now
--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
well,
those
come
to
mind
what
your
honor
has
mentioned,
but
in
cases
that
i've
been
familiar
with
where
1391
has
been
used
and
it's
been
used
at
least
17
times,
as
we
put
in
our
appendix,
once
you're
hit
with
a
1391
(e),
you
are
going
to
be
in
pain
and
suffering
and
in
danger
of
ultimate
difficulties
for
a
long
time
before
you
can
extricate
yourself
even
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
yes.
i
can
give
your
honor
an
example
that
i
think
is
valid.
the
--
a
non-petitioner
here
who
is
a
defendant
below
is
named
goodwin.
i
also
represent
him
in
a
--
where
he's
been
hit
as
a
shuttlecock
in
new
york
city.
he
is
sued
twice
there,
not
on
the
same
fact
situation,
but
he's
sort
of
a
target
because
he's
a
government
prosecutor.
and,
in
those
cases,
the
long
arm
statute
was
declared
by
the
district
court
judge
not
to
be
applicable
because
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to,
at
the
threshold,
to
give
jurisdiction
on
the
long
arm
statute.
but
judge
hate
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
held
that
1391
(e),
without
such
evidence,
was
sufficient
and
he
is
held
there
in
those
cases
because
of
that.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
he
will
have
to
go
to
nome.
he
will
have
to
go
to
portland.
he
will
have
to
go
to
albuquerque.
and,
many
people
think
that
a
government
official
is
only
sued
once
even
if
it's
the
same
facts,
but
in
the
tandem
case,
take
colby,
for
example,
he
was
hit
as
a
shuttlecock
in
washington,
d.c.
he
lives
in
maryland.
he
was
hit
in
rhode
island
in
driver
against
helms
in
a
billion-dollar
case
against
him.
he
was
hit
in
san
francisco
in
kipperman
v.
mccone.
and
it
was
only
because,
after
two
years,
we
were
able
to
persuade
judge
renshaw
that
1391
(e)
didn't
apply
to
money
damage
suits
out
of
the
pocketbooks
of
government
officials.
it's
a
different
kind
of
a
suit,
so
that,
it
can
be
difficult
where
you're
hit
repeatedly
with
an
easy
statute.
now,
the
tradition
has
always
been
that
defendants,
whether
they
are
government
officials
or
not,
that
they're
sued
where
they're
--
they
live,
where
they're
found
and
that's
true
of
all
of
us.
we're
sued
that
way.
by
seizing
on
a
mandamus
type
action
statute
in
1962,
the
civil
rights
bar
here
is
attempting
to
hit
government
officials
throughout
the
country
in
forums
where,
and
this
is
significant,
in
forums
where
there
is
no
contact
either
that--
no
contact
where
the
action
did
not
arise.
the
statute
is,
if
that's
1391
(e),
the
venue
section
is
drafted
in
such
a
way
that
wherever
a
plaintiff
goes
he
may
bring
a
1391
action.
take
colby.
in
colby,
the
plaintiffs,
one
of
them
lived
in
rhode
island.
nothing
else
happened
in
rhode
island.
the
mail
openings
didn't
happen
in
rhode
island.
the
defendants
never
been
in
rhode
island
and
there
are
25
of
them.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
none
of
the
defendants
are
in
rhode
island.
this
is
the
“a
misused”
and
“a
misconstruction”
of
a
statute
that
was
meant
to
apply
to
judicial
review
actions,
administrative
actions
where
a
historic
anomaly
caused
them
to
be
brought
up
to
1962
only
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and,
wh--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
the
--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
judicial
review
would
make
it
possible
to
bring
judicial
review
in
a
mandamus
type
action
in
every
district
court,
after
1962,
and
we're
not
quarreling
with
that.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
we
don't
object
to
that
at
all.
the
--
there
was
good
reason,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
let
me
state
the
reason
and
i
think
it's
factual
and
it
goes
to
the
root
of
this
case.
hammer
budge
was
a
congressman
from
idaho.
his
constituents
complained
that
they
could
not
bring
an
action
for
judicial
review
in
connection
with
land
rights,
grazing
rights,
wool
rights,
mineral
rights,
and
because
even
though
they
had
--
the
plaintiff
was
there,
the
local
government
official
was
there,
the
witnesses
were
in
idaho
and
the
documents
were
in
idaho,
he
had
to
go
to
washington,
d.c.
because
of
this
anomaly.
and,
he
thought
that
was
an
outrage,
and
he
was
right.
it
was
an
outrage.
so,
hammer
budge
came
to
washington
and
he
went
before
this
committee,
and
it's
on
the
first
pages
of
the
hearings.
the
court
below
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
the
hearings,
but
your
honors
have
the
benefit
of
these
hearings.
in
the
first
pages,
he
says
“let
me
tell
you
what
my
problem
is.
we
need
judicial
review
out
west,
3,000
miles
away,
and
we
can't
get
any
justice
because
if
you
say
to
us
bring
all
those
witnesses
and
bring
all
those
documents
and
bring
all
those
to
washington,
why,
then
we
don't
do
it
and
we
lose
our
day
in
court.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
well,
i
think
that
that
was
his
intention
and
i
think
that
his
intention
was--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
yes.
the
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
1391
(e)
has
been
before
this
court.
this
court
in
schlanger
against
seamans,
in
1971,
examined
the
history
of
this
statute
and
found
that
it
was
not
literal.
you
didn't
follow
every
word
of
the
statute,
but
you
look
to
the
mischief
at
which
it
was
directed
and,
there,
it
was
found
not
to
apply
to
habeas
corpus
actions.
and,
mr.
justice
douglas
said
explicitly
at
that
time
that
1391
(e)
was
to
broaden
venue
in
those
civil
actions
that
were
restricted
prior
to
1962
to
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
he
did.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
he
did,
and
--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
very
valid
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
was
--
that
request
to
have
the
president
do
that
was
done
because
of
the
fear
of
the
deputy
attorney
general
at
that
time
that
there
might
conceivably
be
a
misinterpretation
of
its
narrow
limits.
and,
i
think
with
hindsight,
that
that
was
present,
but
the
cases
have
determined
that
it
is
limited
to
these
kind
of
cases,
mandamus
type.
and,
i
think
it's
interesting
that
in
1976,
the
only
time
i
know
that
congress
reviewed
the
mandamus
and
venue
act,
that,
there,
it
stated
in
the
hearings
and
the
reports
that
it
was
limited
to
mandamus
type
actions.
it
said
that,
limited
to
judicial
review.
now,
the
second
circuit
has
also
had
occasion
to
review
1391
(e),
and
judge
friendly,
in
natural
resources
and
tva,
found
that
tva
and
its
officials
in
an
injunction
action
was
not
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
he
--
judge
friendly
said
that
the
--
this
particular
statute
was
not
the
kind
of
a
text
that
could
be
parsed
with
the
aid
of
a
grammar
and
dictionary,
but
rather,
what
should
be
looked
to
was
what
was
the
mischief
it
tried
to
cure
and
what
it
was
trying
to
cure
here
was
to
allow
judicial
review
actions,
mandamus
type
actions,
in
the
district
courts
outside
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
the
--
this
action
brought
by
the
respondents
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
was
not
in
any
way
restricted.
tort
damage
actions
against
public
officials
were
never
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia.
that's
a
ridiculous
position
and
it
doesn't
fit.
what
it
--
what
must
be
done
here
is
to
examine
the
context
of
the
reports.
they
are
preferred
source.
in
the
context,
it
is
clear
that
the
problem
related
to
providing
judicial
review
actions
of
eliminating
the
problem
of
indispensible
partings
of
allowing
venue
where
there
were
actions
against
officials
in
the
--
in
connection
with
their
duties.
there
were
no
personal
jurisdiction
problems
and
there
were
no
problems
of
any
kind
in
connection
with
a
tort
action
against
an
official.
i
submit
to
the
court
that,
in
1962,
actions
of
this
kind,
i've
said,
didn't
exist.
they
weren't
established
until
1971,
but
actions
against
public
officials
for
wrongdoing
to
a
citizen
were
sueable.
they
were
rare
because
of
the
--
of
high
immunity,
official
immunity.
the
recovery
was
not
always
successful,
but
from
little
against
barreme
in
1804
to
yusalle
against
goth,
barr
against
mateo,
howard
v.
lions,
these
cases
all
sued,
usually
in
the
state
courts,
but
or
sometimes,
transferred
to
the
federal
courts,
but
they
were
these
suits
but
they
were
not
restricted
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
they
were
not
mandamus
actions.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
howard
was
my
--
that
was
in
the
massachusetts
district
court.
howard
against
lions,
decided
by
mr.
justice
harlan
the
same
day
as
barr
against
mateo,
but
it
was
diversity.
i
was
simply
showing
that
you
did
not
have
a
jurisdiction
problem
and
you
did
not
have
a
venue
problem.
you
did
not
have
a
service
problem
if
you're
suing
in
the
kind
of
cases
that
the
respondents
are
suing
in,
which
are
tort
actions.
even
jumping
over
the
fact
that
bevins
type
actions
didn't
exist
at
the
time.
i
submit
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
preferred
source,
the
house
reports,
and
the
senate
reports
on
this
bill
show
that
these
were,
in
essence,
against
the
united
states.
that
was
the
keynote,
and
not
in
essence
against
an
individual.
there
is
a
sentence
and
this
is
the
heart
of
the
respondents'
case.
there
is
a
sentence
that
you
will
find
in
the
middle
of
the
house
report
and
you'll
find
it
in
the
middle
of
the
senate
report,
and
that
sentence
says
--
it
talks
about
damage
actions
against
officials.
and,
i
submit
that
if
you
involve
the
venue
people
that
the
committees
were
discussing,
that
if
you
read
the
prior
paragraph
just
once,
and
if
you
read
the
prio
--
the
paragraph
after
that,
you
will
see
that
what
was
being
discussed
there
was
the
kind
of
an
action
which
was
brought
before
1962
very
often,
and
that
is
an
action
for
damages
against
a
government
official
in
his
individual
capacity
to
circumvent
what
remained
of
the
sovereign
immunity
and
that
it
didn't
come
out
of
his
own
pocket.
he
was
named.
it
was
a
fiction.
but,
i
assure
you
that
it
is
no
fiction
to
be
sued
in
one
of
these
tort
actions
that
respondents
have
brought
where
your
mortgage
is
up
for
grabs,
where
your
--
you
have
to
go
all
over
the
country
to
defend
yourself
and
your
personal
reputation.
it
is
this
type
of
pain
and
suffering
that
is
--
that
occurs,
that
is
entirely
different
than
if
you
have
a
mandamus
type
action
where
you
might
not
even
appear
in
court.
and,
you
--
it
goes
in
on
affidavits
and
it's
a
question
of
government
policy
and
if
you
change
jobs,
the
next
fellow,
he
has
to
follow
the
new
rules,
if
there
are
new
rules.
but
when
you
--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
which
deputy
attorney
general,
mr
--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
well,
i
don't
agree,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
deputy
attorney
general
walsh,
i
submit,
was
merely
relating
what
kind
of
actions
could
be
brought.
he
was
making
no
recommendations.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
and
that
fairly
read,
and
i
read
it
again
last
night,
fairly
read
that
letter
of
deputy
attorney
general
white
says
that
it
is
the
understanding
of
the
sp
--
it
was
his
understanding
of
the
sponsors
that
they
did
not
intend
a
money
judgment
action
against
officials.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
and
if
legislation
does
not,
as
it
is
written,
i'm
talking
about
the
language
of
1391
(e)
and
also
of
1361,
the
whole
statute.
i
don't
believe
that
that
language
does
give
the
right
to
sue
public
officials
in
their
pocketbooks
in
every
district
court
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
another.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
that's
the
way
i
interpret
it.
what
they
were
doing
viewed
fairly,
and,
at
the
time,
they
were
trying
to
be
helpful
and
they
weren't
making
any
recommendations.
and,
i
think
to
--
if
they
recommend
a
certain
procedure
that
isn't
followed,
that
doesn't
mean
that
--
necessarily
that
that
is
an
agreement.
these
were
slanderees
to
turnover,
revolutionize,
what
has
been
a
rule
of
this
court
for
200
years
since
1789.
it
has
been
--
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
yes,
your
honor.
the
1976
amendment
was
--
they
found
a
difficulty
in
connection
with
the
1962
law,
and
that
is
that,
in
a
judicial
review
type
of
action,
sometimes
you
had
to
bring
in
someone
who
was
not
a
united
states
official.
you
had
to
bring
in
a
state
agency
or
you
had
to
bring
in,
if
you
had
a
land
action
in
idaho,
the
--
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
well,
the
1976
amendment,
in
reviewing
the
mandamus
act
of
1962,
said
that
it
was
limited
to
mandamus
type
actions,
judicial
review
actions,
and
that's
what
it
said.
it
said
nothing
else.
and,
there
is
nothing,
i
submit,
in
the
final
remark,
there
is
nothing
about
personal
tort
actions
in
these
reports
and
there
is
nothing
about
civil
rights.
there's
a
lot
about
land
rights
and
grazing
rights,
but
nothing
about
civil
rights.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
one
thing
that
mr.
dirver,
who
would
find
it
so
burdensome
to
move,
did
sue
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
the
same
facts
and
did
get
recovery.
so,
it
wasn't
so
tough
for
mr.
driver.
and,
insofar
as
the
acts
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
i
hesitate
to
go
into
the
facts
but
mr.
wulf
went
beyond
the
record.
we
know
from
the
rockefeller
commission
report
and
that
senate's
committee
report
that
walters
didn't
know
about
the
mail
intercept
program
until
it
was
ended
and
colby
is
the
one
who
stopped
it
and
he
knew
about
it
a
week
before
he
stopped
it.
and,
to
make
people
travel
around
the
country
because
they
sock
--
stopped
the
program
because
rodney
driver
wants
to
bring
them
up
in
front
of
judge
petin
in
rhode
island
seems
to
be
not
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
peter
megaree
brown
and,
on
attorney's
fees,
they
are
not
all
being
paid.
patrick
grey
is
being
sued
in
new
york
as
an
official.
he's
not
being
paid.
and,
if
you
act
beyond
the
color
of
your
authority,
you
can't
be
paid
by
the
united
states.
the
regulations
provide
for
that
and
that's
what
mr.
wulf
alleges
in
this
case.
