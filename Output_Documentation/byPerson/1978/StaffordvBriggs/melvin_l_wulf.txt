mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
has
been
proceeding
in
a
very
abstract
kind
of
way
and
i
would
like
to
introduce
a
little
concreteness
to
it
for
a
moment,
if
i
may.
i
want
to
remind
the
court
what
this
suit
is
about
and
what
the
issues
and
problems
are
confronting
the
plaintiffs.
the
suit
grows
out
of
a
massive
20-year-program
by
the
central
intelligence
agency
to
secretly
open
first-class
mail
sent
to
and
from
the
united
states.
and,
from
1953
until
1973
in
the
course
of
implementing
that
program,
the
central
intelligence
agency,
their
officials
and
officers,
opened
about
215,000
pieces
of
first-class
mail.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
are
many
more.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
were
letters
going
to
and
from
the
soviet
union
predominantly,
your
honor,
yes.
215000
letters
in
the
course
of
20
years,
no
warrant,
no
permission,
no
consent,
flagrantly
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
20
years
of
lawless
conduct,
no
question
about
it,
established
beyond
per
venture
in
the
church
committee
report
and
in
the
rockefeller
committee
report.
what
this
suit
--
this
suit
was
filed
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
people
whose
mail
was
opened
for
the
purpose
of
compensating
them
for
the
flagrant
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights,
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
also
to
deter,
hopefully,
repetition
of
this
same
kind
of
flagrantly
lawless
conduct
by
these
defendants
in
the
future
or
by
their
successors.
the
question
in
this
case
then,
as
it
arises
in
this
so
very
abstract
contest
--
context,
has
a
very
concrete
foundation
to
it.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
parties
who
were
injured
in
this
constitutionally
fundamental
way
may
seek
vindication
conveniently
in
a
place
--
in
a
jurisdiction
of
their
selection,
in
the
jurisdiction
where
they
reside,
or
whether
vindication
of
their
rights
is
to
be
made
difficult,
difficult
by
requiring
them
to
chase
defendants
all
around
the
country
and
try
to
track
down
those
who
they
believed
were
responsible
for
the
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
opening
the
mail?
it
was
done
during
the
second
world
war
and
i
think
the
conditions
would
be
so
different
that
there
might
well
be
an
argument
for
it,
but
it
has
no
application
at
all
in
the
context
of
this
cia
program
which
was
not
conducted
during
war
time,
and
which
has
been
conceded
by
the
united
states
to,
in
fact,
be
illegal
and
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
might
be
that
people
wouldn't
object
that
there
might
be
consent,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
there
is
no
consent
in
this
case.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
war
power
might
justify
it,
your
honor.
but
,still,
it
has
no
application
here
because
there
was
no
war.
there
was
no
war
under
way
and
this
court
said
in
ex
parte
jackson,
over
100
years
ago,
and
reaffirmed
here
in
the
united
states
versus
van
leeuwen,
just
several
years
ago,
that
opening
mail
without
a
warrant
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
is
not
a
war
time
situation.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
could've
done
that,
your
honor,
and
that
raises
the
question
about
the
kind
of
case
that
this
is.
this
is
a
big
case.
this
is
a
case
which
is
being
prosecuted
along
the
plaintiffs'
side
by
the
aclu
with
no
expense
to
the
parties,
the
party
plaintiffs,
and
being
prosecuted
--
and
being
defended
on
the
defendants'
side
by
the
united
states
at
no
expense
to
the
defendants.
it's
perfectly
true
that,
in
this
case,
we
might
have
brought
this
action
where
the
course
of
action
arose,
although
i'm
sure
that
the
defendants
would
find
some
objection
to
that
also.
that
would
have
been
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
where
the
program
was
largely
implemented,
but
this
is
not
the
paradigmatic
case.
i
would
pose
to
the
court
the
paradigmatic
case
being
the
small
case
where
the
plaintiff
has
much
less
of
a
chance
where
his
constitutional
rights
were
violated.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
actual
answer
is,
if
you
want
an
actual
answer
--[attempt
to
laughter]
is
that
the
first
complaint
that
we
received
was
from
dr.
rodney
driver
who
lived
in
rhode
island
and
then
we
decided
to
bring
it
there.
we
did
not
think
it
was
an
inhospitable
forum,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and,
it's
--
but,
the
case,
i
put,
is
the
smaller
case
where
a
plaintiff
is
on
his
own
and
where
expense
and
convenience
is
very
critical
to
him.
if
he
has
to
go
to
new
york,
if
mr.
driver
had
to
come
down
and
litigate
this
in
new
york
all
by
himself
at
his
own
expense
from
rhode
island,
it's
unlikely
that
he
would
do
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
you're
quite
right
of
course.
the
venue
statues
are
traditionally
drawn
to
assist
defendants.
this
--
in
this
case,
congress
expressly
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
one
was
to
assist
plaintiffs.
the
senate
report
says
that
the
purpose
of
1391
(e)
is
“to
provide
readily
available
inexpensive
judicial
remedies
for
the
citizen
who
is
aggrieved
by
the
workings
of
government.”
in
these
kinds
of
cases
where
it
was
the
government
on
one
side
inflicting
injury
on
citizens
and
residents
on
the
other
side,
congress
made
this
conscious
determination
that
it
was
going
to
shift
the
balance
of
convenience
where
venue
and
jurisdiction
was
going
to
--
was
concerned
and
was
going
to
simplify
the
process
for
the
plaintiffs
and
impose
what
additional
burdens
might
be
necessary
upon
defendants.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
think
schlanger
was
wrong.
there's
another
--
but,
there's
another
explanation
for
schlanger,
too,
because
the
statute
1391
(e)
does,
of
course,
say
that
it
applies
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
law.
there
is
a
very
long
--
it
doesn't
say
“by
statute,”
it
says
“by
law.”
there
is
a
very
long
tradition
of
habeas
corpus
of
course,
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years,
back
to,
i'm
sure,
to
england
that
habeas
jurisdiction
lies
only
where
the
petitioner
is
held
in
custody.
and,
that
is
otherwise
--
as
otherwise
provided
by
law.
so
that,
this
--
there
are
many
aspects
of
civil
procedure
which
do
not
apply
to
habeas
proceedings
because
of
their
special
--
because
of
its
special
characteristics.
i
think
this
is
just
another
example
of
that.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that's
the
coram
nobis
provi
--
that--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
2255,
where
a
federal
prisoners
are
concerned,
yes.
and
this
--
yes,
this
court
upheld
that
as
a
departure
from
traditional
habeas
practice,
but
it
was
a
--
it
was
made
explicit
by
--
an
explicit
change
by
congress.
no
explicit
change
here
in
1391
(e),
making
it
applicable
to
habeas
in
prior
practice
and
tradition
controls.
if
that's
not
sufficient
explanation,
then
it's
wrong.
it
ought
to
be
changed
by
--
in
this
action.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
footnote
is
wrong,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
don't
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
the
habeas
is
a
special
statute.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
going
to
review
the
whole
legislative
history,
i
assure
you.
i
do
want
to
say
that
we
continue
to
place
confidence
in
that
reference
in
the
committee
reports
which
refers
to
“the
venue
problem
also
arises
in
an
action
against
a
government
official,
seeking
damages
from
him
for
actions
which
are
claimed
to
be
without
legal
authority,
but
taken
in
the
course
of
performing
his
duty.”
mr.
nemser
would
have
you
relate
that
very
intimately
to
the
preceding
paragraph,
but
i
can
split
hairs
as
well
as
the
next
lawyer,
and
there's
been
much
of
that
today.
it
doesn't
say
“the
same
venue
problem.”
it
doesn't
say
“that
venue
problem.”
it
says
“the
venue
problem.”
that's
a
different
venue
problem
and
it
refers
explicitly
--
i
withdraw
explicitly,
arguably
to
the
problem
before
us
today.
i
think
the
use
of
the
phrase
“under
color
of
legal
authority”
is
very
telling
in
our
--
in
support
of
our
argument
because
that
is,
of
course,
the
expression
always
used
to
impose
personal
liability
upon
government
officials
when
they
violate
constitutional
rights
under
the
civil
rights
acts
and
elsewhere.
the
sub
--
the
1967
subcommittee
hearings,
i'm
quick
to
confess,
can
be
read
and
are
being
read
by
both
sides
for
their
own
support.
i
think
there
is
sufficient
reference
in
there
by
various
congressmen
to
indicate
an
interest
in
this
ven
--
in
simplifying
the
process
whereby
plaintiffs,
injured
citizens,
can
seek
vindication
of
injuries
inflicted
upon
them
by
government
officials
to
support
our
position.
i
think
those
letters
by
mr.
justice
white
when
he
was
deputy
attorney
general
and
the
other
two
deputy
attorney
generals
are
very
influential
because
they're
contemporaneous.
they
show
what
was
in
the
minds
of
those
members
of
the
department
of
justice
who
were,
at
the
time,
concerned
with
what
this
meant.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i'm
sorry?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
they
were
not.
they
were
asking
that
it
be
changed,
and
it
was
not
changed,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
they
surely
were
not,
but
they
were
trying
to
influence
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
correct,
but
it
certainly
shows
what
he
thought
it
meant.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don't,
really.
i
think
that,
whoever
it
was
that
had
him
--
it
may
have
been,
i
can't
remember
whether
it
was
mr.
katzenbach
or
justice
white
who
might
have
submitted
that
to
him,
but
i
just
don't
know,
i
don't.
i'm
just
trying
to
understand,
obviously
trying
to
make
a
case.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
think
we
can
assume
that
he
did
not
think
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
think
it
up
on
his
own
or
think
of
it
at
all
perhaps.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
can't
change,
just
can't
change
a
legislative
history
and
legislative
intent
even
expre
--
it
could
be
a
kind
of
a
statement
of
hope
perhaps,
but
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it's
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
is
some
confusion
therein,
some
conflict
here,
surely,
and
the
one
would
be
less
than
frank
if
one
didn't
admit
it.
that's
why
--
but
there's
enough
on
our
side,
i
believe,
to
support
our
reading
of
the
statute
as
a
very,
very
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
we
propose
to
the
court,
but
i
think
that
that
also
can
be
informed
by
the
court's
--
that
the
court's
interpretation
can
be
informed
by
the
beneficial
purpose
which
1391
(e)
will
perform
if
it
is
read
as
we
propose
that
it
would
be
read.
and,
that,
of
course
is
to
simplify
the
process
whereby
citizens
and
residents
of
the
united
states
can
increase
the
quality
of
their
access
to
the
courts
in
order
to
have
their
rights
vindicated
and
congress,
as
i
read
a
moment
ago,
said
that
the
purpose
--
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
was
to
facilitate,
was
to
simplify
the
--
that
particular
process.
and
it
is
important
it
seems
to
me,
to
serve
that
purpose
here
because
what
we
have
is
a
direct
clash.
this
isn't
a
case
between
opposing
private
parties.
it
applies
in
cases
where
government
officials
are
charged
with
official
misconduct.
the
court
can
decide
whether
it
wants
to
make
it
easier
or
harder
for
--
it
can
partially
base
its
decision
in
this
case,
its
construction
of
the
statute,
on
whether
it
wants
to
make
it
easier
for
harder
for
plaintiffs
to
seek
--
to
get
the
kind
of
recompense
which
they're
seeking
in
this
case.
and
the
equities,
that,
of
course
goes
to
the
constitutional
issue
too,
which
mr.
nemser
argues
that
it's
essentially
a
balancing
of
the
equities.
i
don't
--
i
do
not
think
myself
that
--
i
think
the
equities
are
all
with
the
plaintiffs
in
these
kinds
of
cases
and
that
the
defendants
are
not
being
treated
unfairly
if
you
do
read
this
statute
as
we
propose
that
it'd
be
read.
and,
the
reason
is
that
these
defendants
are
not
your
run-of-the
mill
private
party
defendants.
they
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
in
my
mind.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
should
the
court
--
should
a
court
or
any
of
its
members
have
any
doubt,
i
would
simply
say
that
when
a
public
official
--
when
an
individual
chooses
to
become
a
public
official,
chooses
to
occupy
high
office,
takes
an
oath
to
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution,
and
then
is
charged
with
violating
that
high
oath,
as
they
are
in
this
case,
that
they
have
assumed
the
risk,
if
you
will,
of
being
sued
one
place
or
another,
wherever
it
is
that
their
official
misconduct
inflicted
the
particular
injury
and
is
not
unfair.
and,
of
course,
it's
not
--
particularly
not
unfair
in
this
case
because
the
greatest
burden
of
litigation
for
any
of
us
is
the
cost
of
attorney's
fees,
the
cost
of
counsel.
and,
all
of
defendants
in
this
case
are
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there'd
be
a
judgment
against
them
whether
they're
sued
--
when
they're
sued
around
the
corner
from
where
they
live
or
whether
they're
sued
3,000
miles
away.
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
the
question
is
the
additional
expense
of
trying
to
avoid
that
and
it
can
often,
as
we
know,
cost
more
to
avoid
it
than
the
judgment
would've
cost
them
in
the
long
run
too.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
these
defendants
are
not
paying
a
cent
in
attorney's
fees,
have
not
paid
a
cent
in
attorney's
fees
and,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
will
not
pay
a
cent
in
attorney's
fees.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
just
--
what
i'm
saying
is
there's
no
great
burden
on
them
in
being
sued
elsewhere
or
someplace
else
than
where
they
live.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
might
be
changed
but,
as
mr.--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
could
be
changed,
as
mrs.
peterson
says
that
it's
been
the
policy
for
100
years.
if
they
are
paying
the
defendants'
the
expenses
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
can't
think
of
a
case
where
they
wouldn't
pay
them
because
this
is
a
case,
to
go
off
the
record
for
a
moment
but
we
can
--
but
drawing
upon
the
church
committee
report
and
the
other
official
reports,
we
know
this
program
went
on.
we
know
a
lot
of
these
people
were
involved
in
it
and,
still,
they
are
paying
the
fees.
so,
if
they're
paying
it
here,
as
i
say,
it
seems
to
me,
they
would
pay
it
in
any
other
case.
so,
it's
not
unfair
to
them.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
a
couple
of
weeks
inconvenience
to
stand
trial
is--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
agree
it's
more
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
right.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
you're
quite
right,
your
honor.
of
course,
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
serve
the
defendants'
interest
here,
we
have
to
disserve
the
plaintiffs'
interest.
and,
i
think
that
this,
as
--
that
this
is
a
statute
which
was
intended
to
serve
the
plaintiffs'
interest
and
to
put
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
and
to
put
the
defendants'
to
the
necessary
inconvenience
that
might
flow
because
of
their
assumption
of
special
responsibility
as
government
officials.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
surely.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
it
has
some
bearing
on
it,
your
honor,
yes,
because
i
--
it
certainly
is
to
the
constitutional
argument
because
i
think
that
the
weight
of
the
burden
can
determine
whether
a
particular
practice
is
fair
or
not
fair.
here,
the
burden
i
think
is
minimal.
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
not
even
going
to
try
to
improve
upon
the
very
specific
description
of
the
legislative
history
that
ms.
peterson
presented
to
the
court
this
morning.
i
couldn't
improve
on
it
if
i
did
try.
i
did
think
it
was
very
precise
and
persuasive,
and
presented
our
perspective
in
distinction
to
the
opposing
side's
perspective
very
well.
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
put
some
--
put
this
case
into
a
concrete
context,
and
discuss
some
of
the
pragmatic
and
policy
consideration
which
i
think
may
properly
inform
the
court's
ultimate
decision
in
the
case.
and
for
that
purpose,
with
your
leave,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
allude
briefly
to
the
facts
of
the
colby
case,
because
i
think
they
dramatize
what
is
at
stake
here.
this
case
arose
out
of
the
20-year
program
of
the
cia
to
open
first
class
mail
going
to
and
from
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union.
it
was
conducted
without
consent
of
any
of
the
correspondents.
it
was
conducted
without
a
warrant
ever
being
issued
or
applied
for.
it
was,
i
think
it
cannot
be
plainer,
illegal
and
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states.
in
the
course
of
the
program,
the
cia
opened
about
215,000
letters
affecting
110,000
individuals,
american
citizens.
in
response
to
that,
when
the
program
became
known
in
1975,
this
suit
was
filed
in
order
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
persons
whose
mail
was
opened
and
whose
constitutional
rights
have
been
so
sorely
abused
by
their
government,
and
by
the
officials
who
represented
the
government.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
are
two
cases.
from
ex
parte
jackson
in
1880,
i
believe,
to
united
states
versus
van
leeuwen
which
was
about
10
years
ago,
both
in
this
case
--
both
in
this
court,
your
honor,
where
it
was
held
that
a
warrant
was
required
in
order
to
justify
opening
of
first
class
mail
matter.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
--
they
were
both
domestic
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
but
there
may
have
been
probable
--
i
recollect
the
case
to
which
you
refer,
and
that
was
an
obscenity
case,
i
believe,
was
it
not?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
sorry.
i
--
i
don't
recollect.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
in
any
case,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
very,
very
strong,
indeed,
irresistible
argument
that
this
program,
which
in
fact
included
outgoing
mail,
not
only
incoming
mail,
which
i
think
would
change
it
substantially,
was
a
plain
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
question
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i
think
it
was
a
violation
both
ways,
your
honor,
yes,
incoming
and
outgoing.
the
question
--
the
question
then
becomes
whether
the
citizens
whose
rights
were
injured
in
this
case
can
have
a
convenient
mode
of
redress
for
the
serious
--
for
the
serious
intrusion
upon
their
constitutional
rights.
and
the
senate
report
concerning
this
statute
before
us
today
in
fact
says
that
its
purpose,
in
addition
to
everything
else
it
says,
which
is
in
dispute
before
the
court,
this
is
not
in
dispute,
it
says
that
the
purpose
of
1391
(e)
is
to
provide
readily
available,
inexpensive
judicial
remedies
for
the
citizen
who
was
aggrieved
by
the
workings
of
government.
in
this
particular
case,
the
plaintiffs
had
two
options,
apart
from
the
one
which
we
are
arguing
in
support
of
today.
if
he
cannot
bring
the
action
in
the
district
where
he
lives,
where
mr.
driver
lives,
he
would
either
have
to
go
to
the
several
districts
where
the
individual
defendants
reside,
or
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
jurisdiction
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
as
an
individual
citizen
it
would
be
equally
burdensome
for
him
to
have
to
travel
to
new
york,
where
it
would
appear
that
the
cause
of
action
arose,
and
even
more
burdensome
to
have
travel
around
the
country
to
find
--
to
file
individual
suits
against
the
several
defendants
in
this
case.
the
convenient
thing,
that
condition
which
would
satisfy
the
stated
objective
of
the
senate
in
this
--
in
adopting
this
statute,
allows
them
to
file
suit
conveniently
and
inexpensively
in
the
jurisdiction
where
he
resides.
so
that
he
may
easily
vindicate
the
violation
of
his
constitutional
and
statutory
rights.
and
that
convenience,
of
course,
is
one
that
was
explicitly
in
the
minds
of
congress
when
they
passed
this
statute.
and
that
is
--
those
are
the
interests
represented
on
the
plaintiffs'
side
of
this
case.
congress
has
declared
that
where
government
officials
violate
citizens'
rights,
that
the
plaintiffs
should
be
easily
able
to
get
judicial
vindication.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
--
i
think
so,
your
honor.
because
it
was
--
it
was
our
position
in
the
first
circuit
that
this
statute
applied
so
long
as
the
defendant
was
a
serving
government
official
at
the
time
service
was
made
upon
them,
and
that
a
change
in
status
thereafter
was
--
did
not
affect
the
effective
jurisdiction
that
was
secured
in
the
first
place.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
our
position
in
the
first
circuit
was
that
the
different
position
made
no
difference
at
all,
that
it
was
the
question
--
the
only
--
the
determinative
question
was
whether
the
defendant
was
a
serving
government
officer
at
the
time
process
was
served
--
effectively
served
upon
him.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
you're
quite
right.
i'm
afraid
i
put
that
part
of
the
case
somewhat
out
of
my
mind
since
it's
not
here.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that's
correct,
yes.
yes,
thank
you
for
clarifying
that.
it
was
in
fact
our
position
that
it
apply
to
present
and
former
officials.
it's
our
--
it's
now
our
position
that
it
applies
under
any
circumstances
as
long
as
process
was
served
at
--
when
the
defendant
was
a
serving
government
official,
yes.
to
be
balanced
against
the
considerations
in
the
plaintiff's
favor
in
these
cases,
in
order
to
provide
a
simple,
convenient,
and
inexpensive
means
of
redress
for
injured
citizens,
are
the
interests
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
and
whether
you
consider
this
part
of
my
argument
as
being
in
response
to
mr.
nemser's
constitutional
argument,
or
merely
as
a
--
as
helping
to
inform
the
court's
decision
in
the
statutory
interpretation
process,
it
really
comes
down
to
the
same
thing.
because
what
i'm
--
because
the
balance
of
interests
asserted
by
the
defendants
in
this
case
are
not
real.
and
they
would
affect
both
the
--
they
would
affect
the
due
process
argument
if
the
court
thinks
seriously
that
there
is
a
due
process
argument.
but
in
any
case,
those
interests,
as
i
say,
are
not
real,
and
are
pallid
in
contrast
to
the
real,
palpable
interests
that
are
advanced
on
plaintiffs'
behalf
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
is
concerned.
in
the
first
place,
and
i
think
critically,
the
petitioners
and
the
government
would
have
you
think
these
are
just
any
old
defendants.
these
are
not
any
old
defendants.
these
are
government
officials.
these
are
men
and
women
who
took
an
oath
when
they
took
office
to
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
not
to
violate
the
laws
and
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
constitution
doesn't
apply
to
private
citizens,
it
only
applies
to
government
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i'm
sorry?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it's
enforceable
but
it's
enforceable
only
against
government
officials,
of
course.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
bill
of
rights,
your
honor;
sorry.
the
--
the
provision
--
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
which
are
before
the
court
today,
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
and
in
that
sense
these
defendants
are
in
fact
different
because
they
assume
the
responsibility
that
private
citizens
do
not
have,
and
having
assumed
that
responsibility
they
should
be,
and
can
be,
in
a
constitutional
and
non-constitutional
sense,
be
dealt
with
differently
because
they
are
different.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fundamental
conception
which
the
petitioners
would
have
you
overlook.
in
addition
to
that,
in
this,
in
both
of
these
cases,
and
for
the
foreseeable
future
until
the
code
of
federal
regulations
is
amended,
there
is
the
additional
fact
that
there
is
no
burden
today
on
these
defendants,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
government
is
paying
what
is
the
principal
burden
apart
from
a
judgment,
in
defense
of
a
lawsuit,
and
that
is
the
fees
of
attorneys
to
represent
a
person
who
is
sued.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
could,
but
we're
--
but
this
case
should
be
judged
by
the
events
and
by
the
situation
as
it
now
exists.
the
provision
for
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
--
there
have
been,
i
--
they
have
been
--
they
have
been
rare,
as
far
as
i
know.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that's
a
--
that's
a
prospect,
of
course.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
suit
has
been
in
litigation
for
--
it
was
filed
in
--
summer
of
1975,
and
there
have
been
a
lot
of
court
appearances
in
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals,
and
i
have
yet
to
see
a
defendant,
literally.
so
it's
been
no
burden
yet.
if
we
get
pass
this
argument,
and
if
we
prevail,
then
all
of
the
instances
that
attend
to
the
litigation
process
are
going
to
come
into
being.
but
even
though
they
may
have
to
travel,
i
mean,
in
balancing
the
equities,
they
may
have
to
travel,
they
may
have
to
travel
to
my
office
if
i
note
the
depositions
to
be
taken
there.
but
the
fact
is
that
that
might
occupy
a
day
of
their
time,
maybe
two
days,
depending
on
who
the
individual
defendant
is.
but
we
all
know
that
it's
the
cost
of
attorney's
fees
that
is
the
great
burden
in
the
defense
of
litigation,
and
that
the
time
--
although
if
it
were
going
to
be
a
protracted
trial
elsewhere,
that
might
also
occupy
some
of
their
time.
but
that's
not
a
serious
burden,
it
seems
to
me.
it's
not
a
serious
burden
to
cast
upon
individuals
who
are
charged,
as
they
are
here,
with
violating
the
constitution.
and
it's
all
a
balancing
process,
as
we
know,
and
that
to
simplify
and
make
convenient
the
right
of
citizens
to
vindicate
their
constitutional
rights,
and
to
weigh
that
against
such
relatively
insignificant
considerations,
i
think
such
as
a
little
time
--
the
defendants
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that's
true.
the
balance
of
advantage
then
shifts,
your
honor,
because
then
there'll
be
a
much-increased
burden
upon
the
plaintiffs.
and
although
it
might
not
make
any
difference
in
this
case,
since
the
plaintiffs
in
fact
are
being
represented
at
no
cost
by
the
aclu,
this
really
isn't
the
paradigmatic
case.
i
would
ask
you
to
think
of
a
case
where
--
which
is
a
little
case,
where
the
aclu
was
not
representing
the
plaintiffs,
where
it's
an
individual
who
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
in
this
case,
we
represent
little
people,
but
in
large
volume.
[laughter]
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
frankly
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
this
case
presents
the
court
with
the
question
whether
in
suits
by
citizens
to
vindicate
violations
of
constitutional
rights,
it
doesn't
want
to
shift
the
burden.
and
that
in
the
interests
of
defending
the
constitution,
and
in
the
interests
of
allowing
successful
vindication,
convenient
vindication
and
inexpensive
vindication
of
the
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
that
the
court
oughtn't
construe
this
statute
to
serve
that
purpose.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
no.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
well
i
think
it
comes
to
the
same
thing.
a
violation
is
--
may
be
more
profound
if
it's
a
constitutional
violation,
but
still,
a
statutory
violation
is
serious
enough
by
itself.
it
doesn't
--
i'm
not
making
any
distinction
between
the
two
--
the
two
sorts.
thank
you
very
much.
