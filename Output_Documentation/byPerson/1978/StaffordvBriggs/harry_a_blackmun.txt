mr.
brown,
before
you
sit
down,
i
was
called
out
for
a
few
minutes.
you
may
have
covered
it
then,
but
did
you
comment
on
the
1976
amendment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand
all
that,
but
where
does
it
leave
you
with
the
1976
amendment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
you
also
say
the
statute
said
“each
defendant?”
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
know
the
material
was
always
there.
it
wasn't
anything
new.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it's
a
little
unfair
to
--
to
challenge
you
about
the
first
circuit,
because
you're
not
defending
that
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
mean,
you're
defending
the
(inaudible)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
the
--
the
significance
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
was
--
was
literalism
as
applied
to
the
statute
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
by
the
two
circuits?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
stillman,
has
ever
--
has
anyone
to
your
knowledge
ever
considered
the
possibility
that
the
language
might
be
descriptive
of
the
character
of
the
defendant
while
he's
defending
the
lawsuit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
which
each
defendant
is
an
officer.
now
that's
no
longer
true
of
these
people.
or
an
employee
acting
either
in
his
official
capacity
or
still
acting
under
color
of
legal
authority
in
trying
to
defend
the
government's
actions.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
you
read
it
that
way,
of
course,
you
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
did
anybody
ever
suggest
it
should
be
read
that
way,
to
your
knowledge?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
nobody
really
argues
it
here.
i
just
--
was
trying
to
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
maybe
it's
so
fanned
so
far
out
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
that
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
but
i
just
wasn't
sure.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wulf,
we
said
before
maybe
the
merits
really
aren't
too
relevant.
but
what
is
the
case
that
holds
that
there's
a
plain
violation
of
fourth
amendment
rights
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
with
a
foreign
--
first
class
foreign
mail?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we
had
case
involving
foreign
mail
recently
that
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
doesn't
really
support
you
very
much.
i
dissented
from
the
case.
well
--
i
guess
it
isn't
relevant,
but
sometimes
--
