justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
1391
(e)
is
more
precisely
the
mandamus
and
venue
act,
actually,
the
mandamus
and
venue
act
incorp
--
in
the
statutes
at
large
appears
as
two
sections,
doesn't
it;
one
creating
section
1361
and
the
other
creating
section
1391
(e)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
when
you
say
“the
legislative
intent
was,”
it's
a
little
bit
hard
to
get
your
version
of
the
legislative
intent
out
of
the
language
of
1391
(e)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except,
in
the
act,
the--
in
one
section,
they
used
the
word
“mandamus”
in
1361
and,
in
1391
(e),
they
use
the
word
“a
civil
action.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
recognized
procedure
pretrial
to
challenge
the
substance
of
the
claim
for
relief
other
than
summary
judgment
or
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
that
it
--
that
the
venue
is
improper?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
at
least
have
to
come
into
the
districts
selected
by
the
plaintiffs
to
--
and
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
for
impro
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so,
if
he
is
to
argue
that
the
claim
--
this
claim
on
its
merits
is
frivolous
or
doesn't
state
a
claim
for
relief,
he
must
at
least
go
to
the
district
which
the
plaintiffs
have
chosen
and
make
that
argument.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
none
of
the
defendants
lived
in
rhode
island?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
both
howard
and
barr
were
diversity
cases,
weren't
they?
barr
was
a
district
of
columbia
general
jurisdiction,
but
howard
was
--
howard
against
lions
was
diversity,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
could've
been
filed
anywhere
in
any
district
in
which
any
of
the
plaintiffs
resided,
could
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
peterson,
what
do
you
do
with
the
footnote
4
in
schlanger
against
seamans
which
seems
to
suggest
that,
perhaps,
a
literal
application
is
not
required
where
it
says
this
section
was
enacted
to
broaden
the
venue
of
civil
actions
which
could
previously
have
been
brought
only
in
the
district
of
columbia?
now,
certainly,
previously,
this
was
an
action
which
could've
been
brought
outside
the
district
of
columbia,
i.e.
under
the
general
venue
statue
where
all
the
defendants
resided?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
was
this
court
that
was
confused
in
schlanger
against
seamans,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
curious
just
about
the
--
what
you
do
with
that
sentence
in
the
footnote
which
doesn't
refer
to
1361,
but
refers
to
1391
(e)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
feel
the
court
was
simply
wrong
in
schlanger?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
that
sentence
isn't
addressed
to
habeas.
it's
addressed
to
the
purpose
for
which
1391
(e)
was
passed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you
say
it
was
a
mistaken,
i
mean,
it's
certainly
been
a
mistake
plenty
times
before?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
president
kennedy's
signing
statement
is
perfectly
consistent
with
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
something
i'm
not
all
sure
you're
right
about
because
the
president
is
a
part
of
the
legislative
process
just
the
way
congress
is.
in
other
words,
a
bill
can't
become
law
without
his
signature
anymore
than
it
can
when
they
were
by
passing
it
in
both
houses.
and,
if
houses
of
congress,
by
reports,
can
make
legislative
history,
why
can't
the
president,
by
a
signing
statement,
make
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could've
served
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would've
served
where
the
claim
arose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
thought
you
said
you
had
to
have
1391
(e)
in
order
to
get
a
pro
--
any
sort
of
venue
or
jurisdiction
over
these
people?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
could've
sued
all
of
them
in
the
district
of
florida,
the
northern
district
of
florida?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
congress
gave
it
to
you,
you're
certainly
entitled
to
it,
but
i
don't
see
how
your
argument
that
you
had
to
have
this
in
order
to
get
any
sort
of
a
lawsuit
follows
from
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
that
hammer
budge
would've
been
quite
satisfied
to
be
able
to
sue
a
government
defendant
in
the
district
where
the
claim
arose
that
his
people
out
in
idaho
had
to
--
wouldn't
have
to
come
back
here
and
wa
--
to
washington.
they
could've
sued
out
in
idaho
if
that's
where
the
government
of
--
government
action
took
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
could
do
it
in
hawaii,
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
the
continental
limits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
at
least
got
to
come
down
into
the
place
where
the
plaintiffs
picked
to
make
their
initial
motion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
the
department
of
justice
shall
or
will
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
another
attorney
general
could
change
that
policy
at
will?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
relevant
is
it
to
the
reading
of
this
statute
whether
or
not
the
government
is
going
to
provide
counsel
and
defense
expenses?
is
that
controlling?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
controlling
whether
the
government
is
going
to
provide
the
representation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
takes
--
it
might
mitigate
the
hardship
argument
but
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
peterson,
may
i
ask
one
other
question
to
be
sure
i
haven't
missed
something?
the
language
that
you
stress,
and
it's
important
language
of
course,
is
to
seek
damages
from
him
personally
for
actions
taken.
now,
that
appeared
in
deputy
general
walsh's
letter
which,
in
turn,
was
included
as
part
of
the
exhibit
to
the
committee
reports,
as
i
understand
it.
was
it
otherwise
used?
did
the
committee
itself
used
that
language
independently
of
quoting
walsh's
letter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
know
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
independently
of
being
quoted
in
--
having
a
letter,
as
a
whole,
quote?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
what
they
were
basically
the
old
custis-lee
mansion
type
of
case
where
you
sue
the
official,
but
what
you
really
want
to
do
is
avoid
sovereign
immunity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
happened
in
tully
against
regan,
wasn't
it,
where
they
dismissed
the
action
against
the
fbi
or
president
agent
in
the
district
of
illinois
because
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
attorney
general
was
regarded
as
an
indispensable
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wulf
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wulf,
1391
(b),
as
i
understand
it,
would
not
require
you
to
follow
the
defendants
to
where
they
lived.
you
could've
sued
where
the
claim
arose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you've
got
--
but
your
venue
statutes
are
traditionally
defendant-oriented
in
civil
cases,
aren't
they?
and,
it
seems
to
me,
both
sides
argue
here
on
the
basis
of
kind
of
special
circumstances
that
--
which
should
be
read
one
way
or
another.
i
don't
think
we
can
take
the
fact
that
it's
a
small
case
or
a
big
case
or
that
the
government's
paying
somebody's
expenses
is
really
controlling
of
the
meaning
of
1391
(e),
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
you
think
the
reading
gibbon,
schlanger
against
seamans
was
such
a
shift,
although
it
doesn't
shift
it
enough
for
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
the
habeas
venue
statute
has
been
--
was
changed
on
the
last
20-25
years
to
make
it
--
you
have
to
go
back
before
the
sentencing
judge
rather
than
where
the
custodian
is
for
federal
habeas,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
doubt
about
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
that
would
require
any
defendant
sued
in
a
united
states
district
court
to
be
sued
where
congress
provided?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
where
united
states
district
courts
rely.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
attorney's
fees
wherever
there
is
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then,
you
--
i
don't
see
how
your
argument
cuts
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
peterson,
you're
of
course
defending
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
did
you
think
the
first
circuit,
which
is
--
is
the
next
case,
likewise
read
the
statute
literally
on
its
face?
do
you
think
the
first
circuit
and
district
of
columbia
circuit's
decisions
are
exactly
alike?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
first
circuit
did
exclude
former
officials
and
the
face
of
the
statute
would
include
them,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
--
i
realize
that
but
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
the
first
circuit
did
not
read
the
statute
literally,
like
you
say
the
district
of
columbia
should
have
and
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
peterson,
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
peter
--
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
stevens
a
letter
from
deputy
attorney
general
walsh.
and
you've
also
relied
in
your
briefs
on
a
letter
from
deputy
attorney
general
white
and
--
and
you've
referred
to
i
think
a
letter,
a
comment
from
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach.
did
this
bill
have
its
genesis
over
a
period
of
years?
because
i
take
it
the
three
deputy
attorney
generals
weren't
all
in
office
at
the
same
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
peterson,
particularly
since
this
is
reargument
and
we
aren't
talking
just
about
two
or
three
sentences,
i
--
i
know
it
can
be
repetitious,
let
--
let
me
ask
you
about
the
--
the
first
line
of
the
first
sentence
of
(e)
with
regard
to
the
defendant
stafford.
and
if
"(e)"
reads
a
civil
action
in
which
each
defendant
is
an
officer
or
employee
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof,
acting
in
his
official
capacity
or
under
color
of
legal
authority.
now,
mr.
stafford's
--
the
grievance
you
have
against
stafford
is
when
he
was
u.s.
attorney,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
when
you
sued
him,
was
he
u.s.
attorney
or
a
united
--
a
u.s.
district
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
capacity
--
in
--
in
which
they
had
been
acting
at
the
time
that
you
claimed
they
violated
your
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
have
sued
stafford
under
this
--
in
this
district
after
he
became
a
district
judge
given
the
merits
of
your
--
given
the
contents
of
your
allegations
on
the
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
he's
a
former
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
although
he's
a
present
official.
he's
certainly
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
he's
a
united
states
district
judge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
doesn't
say
occupy
the
same
office.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean
--
i
mean
after
1962.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
read
the
language
literally
and
uphold
the
d.c.circuit,
you
can
reach
someone
who
has
been
promoted
to
an
entirely
different
federal
office.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
a
substantial
constitutional
question?
i
mean
it's
a
--
this
is
one
country.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
can
the
securities
act
provides
for
nationwide
service
of
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
nelson
rockefeller
when
he
were
alive
have
been
--
named
a
defendant
presumably,
he
could
be
sued
under
your
interpretation
of
the
statute.
he
couldn't
certainly
raise
the
“no
means
clause.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
venue
situation
before
1962
when
someone
who
felt
he'd
been
wrong
by
government
action
and
wanted
to
sue
a
government
official
clearly
had
to
come
back
to
the
district
of
columbia
or
maryland
or
virginia
where
that
citizen
resided
and
sued
them?
he
couldn't
sue
them
anywhere
else
in
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
suggest
the
same
fairness
problem?
here,
someone
maybe
wronged
3000
miles
away?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
will.
the
complaint
of
this
person
may
well
have
been
that
the
government
agent
living
in
maryland
or
virginia
or
the
district
of
columbia
took
away
his
property
without
due
process
of
law
out
on
the
state
of
washington.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
as
reasonable
an
argument
as
the
one
you
are
making
now.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
--
we
had
them
--
that
mail
cover
case
two
or
three
years
ago
from
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
that's
a
shorthand
summary,
i
take
it,
of
the
first
pair
--
the
first
line
of
the
venue
section
we're
talking
about.
do
you
--
do
you
think
if,
in
the
stafford
case,
that
if
judge
stafford
had
not
been
sued
until
he
had
become
a
judge,
but
the
suit
was
based
on
his
activities
as
a
united
states
attorney,
he
would
have
been
subject
to
a
venue
under
that
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
it
might
be
a
quite
different
position
that
he
occupied
at
the
time
of
service
then
the
relief
was
sought
for
his
acts
--
on
the
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
going
to
be
attorney's
fees,
even
if
the
petitioners
prevail
here,
i
take
it.
the
--
your
people
will
find
them
in
whatever
district
they
are
and
they'll
have
to
hire
attorneys
to
fight
the
lawsuit.
i
had
understood
their
argument
to
be
principally
the
kind
of
a
ping
pong
effect
of
having
to
answer
depositions
and
that
sort
of
thing
in
a
place
far
from
where
they
resided.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
--
i
still
don't
understand
your
attorney's
fees
argument,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
lose
here,
and
the
statute
is
construed
the
way
the
second
circuit
construed
it,
it
doesn't
mean
you
can't
sue
these
people.
it
means
that
you
simply
have
to
sue
them
somewhere
else.
and
if
--
when
you
sue
them
somewhere
else,
they're
going
to
have
to
retain
attorneys
where
you
sue
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
always
represented
little
people?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
your
reading
of
the
venue
statute,
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
a
constitutional
violation
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
that
you
could
bring
the
man
2000
miles
for.
it
could
be
a
statutory
violation.
