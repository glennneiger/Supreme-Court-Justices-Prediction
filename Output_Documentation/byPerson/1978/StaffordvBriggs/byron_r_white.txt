mr.
brown?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
any
development
in
the
lower
courts
since
the
original
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
is
that
as
far
as
the
goodwin
case
has
progressed?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i'm
speaking
of
the
goodwin
case,
blackburn
against
goodwin.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
second
circuit
ruled?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
case
help
your
side
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
haven't
filed
it
in
the
supplemental
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
its
fine.
i
do
have
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
gets
better
credentials
in
being
a
judge
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
present
tense
of
the
pivot
on
which
the
first
circuit
excluded
former
officials?
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
peterson,
looking
at
the
intent
of
congress
in
1961
or
whenever
it
was,
doesn't
the
fact
that
the
original
bill
included
the
word
"each,"
and
therefore
contained
the
requirement
that
all
defendants
be
government
officials,
lend
some
support
to
the
notion
that
they
were
primarily
thinking
in
terms
of
actions
which
are
in
substance
against
the
government?
a
damage
action
would
be
more
likely
to
be
one
that
could
have
multiple
defendants,
some
private,
some
public,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
talk
about
the
two
different
kinds
of
damage
actions
that
i
remember.
and
one
is
the
postman
who
goes
home
at
night
and
gets
into
an
automobile
accident
and
they
clearly
don't
want
to
include
that
and
that's
not
under
the
--
under
the
color
of
law.
and
the
other
is
the
libel
and
slander.
and
in
that
context
there
would
be
at
least
a
--
a
greater
likelihood
of
--
of
private
defendants
being
involved
if
you
have,
you
know,
say
a
libel
slander
that's
republished
and
so
forth,
you
could
have
multiple
defendants.
but
they
didn't
include
the
multiple
defendants,
which
is
sort
of
strange
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
really
is
not
a
great
deal
of
discussion
of
private
damages.
there
is
reference
to
it,
you're
right.
but
the
--
there
really
isn't
much
discussion
of
--
of
this
precise
problem
as
i
--
that
i
can
find.
there
is
discussion
of
the
fact
of
a
damage
action
and
--
and
those
two
examples
that
i
found
but
do
they
discuss
any
other
examples
other
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
any
other
kinds
of
damage
actions
other
than
the
postman
case
and
the
libel
or
slander
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
right
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
katzenbach
says
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
we
defend
these
on
the
grounds
of
immunity
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
something,
right.
but
they
don't
discuss
any
other
kinds
of
--
of
damage
of
actions
other
than
those
two
that
--
that
i
noticed.
now
maybe
i
--
i'm
just
really
inquiring
as
to
whether
i've
missed
anything
on
that.
