justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mrs.
peterson,
the
statue
doesn't
contain
that
language
at
the
time
he
committed
the
acts
complained
of?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
were
showing
how
it
went
right
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
then,
you
interpolated
language
which
would've
made
it
read
exactly
as
you
say
but
does
not
appear
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say
“at
the
time
of
his
conduct.”
it
says
“is
at
the
time
of
the
action.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
“is.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
any
of
these
people
acting
in
official
capacity
at
any
time
since
the
litigation
started?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
thought
one
of
these
defendants
was
a
judge
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suing
him
as
a
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
response
to
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
peterson,
could
we
go
back
to
seaman
--
schlanger
against
seamans
for
a
moment?
now,
you
suggest
that
what
this
language
in
the
footnote
was,
more
or
less,
inadvertent,
but
the
holding
of
the
case
was
that
the
air
force
officer
could
not
bring
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
district
in
which
his
claim
arose,
his
contract
for
enlistment
have
been
breached
or
something.
and,
if
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
a
civil
action
within
the
meaning
of
1391
(e),
he
should
have
been
permitted
to
bring
that
action.
so,
don't
you
have
to
either
say
we
should
overrule
that
decision
or
continue
to
accept
habeas
corpus
as
not
being
the
kind
of
civil
action
that
the
statute
refers
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
did
say,
and
you
apparently
accept
that
part
of
the
opinion,
that
a
habeas
proceeding
is
not
a
civil
action
within
the
meaning
of
1391
(e)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
although,
literally,
it
would
appear
to
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
have,
therefore,
acknowledged,
it
would
seem
to
me,
that
this
section
cannot
be
read
in
its
full
literal
scope?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
as
soon
as
you
acknowledge
that,
then
you
say
“well,
what
else
should
be
left
out?”
isn't
it
conceivable
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
damage
actions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
habeas
language
isn't
limiting
language.
there
is
another
statute
describing
the
district
in
which
it
may
be
brought,
and
that's
an
otherwise
authorized
place
to
bring
it.
isn't
it
also
true
that
there
is
other
statutory
language
which
authorizes
this
action
to
be
brought?
in
other
words,
isn't
there
another
section
of
the
venue
action
which
would
say
this
action
could
be
brought
where
the
cause
of
action
arose
or
where
other
plaintiffs
reside,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
were
suing
them
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
deputy
attorney
general
said
the
purpose,
after
saying
it's
an
entirely
different
subject,
went
on
to
say
the
purpose
of
this
section
of
the
bill
is
to
have
officers
who
live
in
the
capital,
that's
washington,
subject
to
suits
throughout
the
country
to
the
extent
that
they
can
now
be
sued
in
the
district.
that
doesn't
fit
your
case.
that's
what
jus
--
byron
white
said
in
that
letter,
pages
9
(a)
and
10
(a)
of
your
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
one
that
begins
in
the
bottom
of
9
(a)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
right
after
the
language
you
read
that
has
an
entirely
different
subject
in
next
sentences
that,
after
exhausting
remedies
to
challenged
legality
of
that
so
--
decision,
the
officer
residing
in
washington
must
be
sued
in
washington.
the
purpose
of
this
section
of
the
bill
is
to
have
officers
who
live
in
the
capital
subject
to
suit
throughout
the
country
to
the
same
extent
that
they
can
now
be
sued
in
the
district.
i
don't
understand
how
that
helps
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
the
one
that
the
deputy
attorney
general
had
in
mind
when
he
said
it
was
entirely
different
from
section
1,
at
least
that's
what
his
letter
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nemser,
before
you
leave
it,
is
that
whole
paragraph
quoted
in
some
of
the
papers?
i
seemed
to
have
missed
it.
i
only
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they
quote
--
i'm
sure.[attempt
to
laughter]
--
the
whole
thing
you've
read,
where
is
that
quote?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nemser,
you
suggested
earlier
that
if
the
--
your
opponent
was
correct,
the
congress
would've
simply
omitted
the
words
“acting
in
his
official
capacity.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
had
they
admitted
it
entirely,
then
you
would've
had
--
this
would've
applied
to
private
litigation
against
a
person
who
happens
to
be
an
officer
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
of
the
united
states
solely
for
breach
of
contract
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
statutory
language,
as
you
suggested,
it
would
simply
read
“a
simple
act
in
which
a
defendant
is
an
officer
or
an
employee.”
now,
you
say,
william
colby
happened
to
be
sued
because
he
didn't
make
his
mortgage
payments
or
something
like
that.
the
statute
would've
then
applied
to
that
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean,
it's
arguable
but
at
least
this
language
was
included
to
avoid
that
reading,
that's
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
the
footnote's
wrong,
you
have
to
decide
the
case
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
1391
(e)
applied,
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
the
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
main
objection
in
venue,
i
suppose,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
long
trial
and
you
live
in
california,
you're
sued
in
new
york,
you've
got
to
spend
a
couple
of
weeks
in
new
york
during
the
trial.
that's
sort
of
an
inconvenience
if
you're
in
business
in
california.
that's
what
the
defendants'
interest
in
being
sued
in
his
residence
is,
not
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
money
to
be
elsewhere
litigating
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
on
the
attorney's
fees,
or
judgment,
or
anything.
it's
just
where
you're
going
to
have
this
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
think
it'd
be
minimal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
whole
purpose
of
venue
is
to
vindicate
that
very
interest.
that's
why
we
have
venue
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
just
say
“sue
anybody
wherever
you
feel
like
it.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
the
issue
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right
on
that
very
point
about
government,
all
its
defense.
what
--
what
would
you
say
today
as
to
the
application
of
a
statute
to
a
liable
action
such
as
barr
against
matteo
or
one
of
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
--
i
take
it
the
government
probably
would
defend
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
letter
from
attorney
general
katzenbach
to
the
district
attorneys
sort
of
assumes
that
they
will
be
defending
this
slander
libel
type
suits
against
the
officer,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
--
i
understand
--
all
that
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
going
to
the
one
point
that
letter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
assuming,
those
would
be
in
the
category
that
the
government
would
normally
defend.
