ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
perhaps
i
should
make
clear,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
merits
of
the
issue,
but
the
united
states
is
paying
for
private
counsel
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
but
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
united
states
will
always
do
that.
in
fact,
there
are
some
policy
guidelines
that
the
department
of
justice
has
issued
that
are
--
can
be
found
at
28
cfr
50.15
and,
section
a
(2)
says
“upon
receipt
of
the
agency's
notification
for
request
for
counsel,
the
civil
division
will
determine
whether
the
employee's
action
is
reasonably
appear
to
have
been
performed
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
and
whether
providing
representation
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
and
these
people
have
no
guarantee
that
that
determination
is
going
to
be
made
in
their
favor
or
that
future
attorneys
general
will
continue
this
policy
or
that
congress
won't
enact
some
law
that
would
prevent
it.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
schlanger
because
we
believe
that
this
court
has,
in
schlanger,
determined
that
the
phrase
“civil
actions”
in
the
statute
does
not
shut
us
out
on
this
issue.
in
schlanger,
the
court
did
have
certain
important
parts
of
the
legislative
history
before
it
because,
in
footnote
4,
it
cites
both
the
house
report
and
the
senate
report.
i'm
talking
about
house
report
536
and
senate
report
1692,
and
both
of
those
compl
--
contain
this
famous
sentence
we've
all
been
discussing
here
about
venue
problems
and
suits
for
damages.
and,
the
senate
report
contains
deputy
attorney
general
white's
letter
that
the
court
below
relied
on
and
that
respondents
rely
on,
and
that
did
not
prevent
this
court
in
schlanger
from
saying,
not
respecting
that
habeas
corpus
could
be
considered
a
civil
action,
and
it
says
it
applies
to
civil
actions.
we're
not
going
to
assume
that
congress
made
this
sweeping
change
in
habeas
corpus
venue.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question,
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
said
when
hammer
budge
was
mentioned,
“isn't
that
just
the
genesis
of
this
legislation
and
didn't
the
congress
actually
enact
the
staten
--
the
statute
later
in
1962?
don't
we
have
to
look
to
the
intent
of
congress
at
that
time?”
i
think
the
1960
hearings
and
what
hammer
budge
and
his
colleagues
on
that
committee
intended
are
very
important
because,
for
one
thing,
the
famous
sentence
that
we're
talking
about
here
appeared
in
the
house
report
in
1936.
the
first
house
report
that
was
issued
right
after
those
hearings
in
that
session
of
congress,
and
that
report
evidently
comes
out
of
what
the
committee
learned
in
the
course
of
the
hearings
and
determined
in
the
course
of
the
hearings.
if
you
go
to
the
hearings,
you
will
find
in
the
transcripts
of
the
hearings,
you
will
find
references
to
damage
actions.
and,
in
the
very
early
pages
of
the
hearings,
there
are
some
sort
of
casual
references
to
suits
against
a
congressman
for
slander
and
suits
against
a
postman
who
slapped
housewives
while
they're
delivering
the
mail,
and
so
on.
but,
as
the
hearings
draw
to
the
close,
after
they've
heard
the
testimony
of
judge
albert
maris
and
the
testimony
of
the
justice
department
representative
and
have
considered
all
the
problems
that
they
needed
to
deal
with
here,
congressman
budge
said
at
the
very
close
of
the
hearing
“people
keep
coming
back
to
these
slander
type
actions,”
this
is
page
2
--102
of
the
transcript,
“people
keep
coming
back
to
these
slander
type
actions
and
that's
not
what
i
had
in
mind
at
all.”
he
says
what
he
did
have
in
mind
was
review
of
administrative
action,
that
the
person
out
in
idaho
can
get
that
review
without
coming
to
the
district
of
columbia.
and,
when
he
spoke
of
his
idaho
constituent
who
had
this
problem
that
he
wanted
to
remedy
by
this
act,
congressman
budge
said
“this
is
a
constituent
who
wants
to
sue
the
federal
officer
in
charge
out
there
and
he
can't
sue
the
federal
officer
in
charge
out
there
because
--
the
reason
he
can't
is
if
he
tried
to
sue
him
in
mandamus,
of
course
only
the
district
of
columbia
had
mandamus
jurisdiction
at
that
time
and
if
the
suit
somehow
escapes
classification
as
a
mandamus
action,
perhaps
it's
viewed
simply
as
an
injunctant,
enjoining
him
from
doing
something,
the
federal
official
in
charge
out
in
idaho
could
simply
say
“well,
i'm
carrying
out
the
orders
of
my
superior
in
washington.”
this
would
raise
the
indispensable
party
problem
and
the
suit
would
be
dismissed
in
idaho.
of
course,
if
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
exactly,
and
it's
what
happened
in
stroud
v.
benson
also.
this
court's
decision
in
williams
v.
fanning
did
not
solve
the
problem.
[attempt
to
laughter]
but,
of
course,
if
the
citizen
out
in
idaho
had
wanted
to
sue
that
federal
officer
in
damages,
in
the
type
of
damage
suit
that
ar
--
had
risen
before
this
act
was
passed,
these
were
typically
trespass
actions,
ejectment
actions,
false
imprisonment,
they
were
common
law
torts,
nothing
would
keep
him
from
suing
him
in
the
state
court
of
idaho,
in
which
the
case
might
be
removed
to
federal
court.
in
fact,
many
of
the
damage
actions
that
respondents
cite
in
their
brief
are
brought
--
were
brought
exactly
this
way.
us
v.
lee
that
they
cite
was
brought
in
the
circuit
county
courts
of
virginia
and
removed
to
the
federal
court.
so,
that
can't
have
been
the
problem
that
representative
budge
was
concerned
with.
also
in
the
hearings,
despite
these
early
references
to
slander
type
actions
and
slapping
--
and
postman
slapping
the
housewives,
representative
doughty,
who
earlier
had
in
a
sort
of
moment
of,
i
think,
irritation
at
the
justice
department
witness,
said
“well,
maybe
we
want
to
cover
all
type
of
actions.”
but
later
on,
justice
doughty,
being
more
fully
advised,
said
“i
don't
have
inconsideration
that
what
we
have
in
mind
here
is
money
damage
type
suits.
now,
the
question
then
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
reading
these
hearings
that
what
these
congressmen
intended
was
not
the
type
of
suit
which
the
respondents
have
brought
here
or
the
type
of
damage
suits
that
existed
against
the
federal
officials
at
that
time.
the
question
then
is,
did
that
intent
carryover
when
congress
passed
the
mandamus
and
venue
statute
in
1962?
now,
the
house
report
in
1962
that
contains
that
sentence
that
was
in
the
earlier
report
is
just
sort
of
verbatim
carried
over
from
the
earlier
report.
there's
no
evidence
that
somebody's
thought
down
and
--
sat
down
and
thought
about
what
that
sentence
meant
anymore
than
they
thought
they
carried
over
the
report
in
toto.
i
might
say
that
the
hearings
throw
some
light
on
that
sentence
however
because
at
page
87
of
the
transcript
somebody
brings
up
the
question
of
money
damages.
judge
maris
is
testifying
at
that
point
and
he
said
“well,
there
are
some
old
damage
type
actions.
there
are
suits
against
collectors.”
and
he
said,
“you
pretend
you're
suing
the
collector
individually,
but
in
fact,
he
has
recoupment
from
the
united
states
if
he
has
just
and
reasonable
cause.”
it's
possible
that
the
person
who
was
directed
to
draw
up
this
house
report,
wanting
to
make
sure
that
he
includes
in
the
report
everything
that's
come
up
in
the
hearings
which
congress
hasn't
said
--
which
the
congressmen
haven't
indicated
that
they
didn't
want
to
cover,
saw
that
remark
and
said
“the
venue
problem
may
arise
sometimes
in
suits
for
damages.”
it's
not
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
i
think
it's
in
the--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
an
explanation
for
that
sentence
and
it's
an
explanation
for
the
sentence
which
suits
our
understanding
of
the
statute,
that
it
refers
to
damage
type
actions
which,
as
mr.
nemser
said,
are
in
essence
against
the
united
states
and
not
the
damage
type
actions
which
we
have
in
this
case,
which
don't
imply
a
fiction
and
which
are
not,
in
essence,
against
the
united
states.
now,
turning
to
the
phrase
“under
color
of
legal
authority,”
this
also
came
up
during
the
hearings
and
it
was
first
raised
by
committee
counsel
drabkin.
later
on,
it
was
picked
up
by
representative
poff
said,
because
they've
been
raising
the
pra
--
the
problem
of,
well,
what
do
you
do
if
the
officers
are
named
individually?
and,
poff
said
“why
don't
we
use
this
phrase”
and
judge
maris,
again,
said
“yes,
use
that
phrase.
that's
a
good
phrase
because,
let's
get
down
to
what
we're
really
doing
here,
reviewing
administrative
action.”
if
they
included
that
phrase,
they
would
also
cover
those
actions
in
which
you
name
the
federal
officer,
pretended
to
be
suing
him
individually,
but
what
you
were
doing
using
the
fiction
of
ex
parte
young,
the
fiction
which
the
larson
court
said
was
a
way
of
getting
around
sovereign
immunity,
but
you
were
still
essentially
reviewing
action
of
the
federal
officer
and
not
suing
him
for
damages.
you
were
going
after
equitable
relief.
and,
as
mr.
nemser
has
pointed
out,
the
phrase
“under
color
of
legal
authority”
is
specifically
explained
in
the
later
house
report.
they
said
what
they
meant
by
it.
what
they
meant
by
it
is
what
we
say
it
means,
and
we
see
no
reason
that
the
court
should
adopt
a
contrary
reading
of
it.
now,
concerning
mr.
justice
white's
letter,
the
court
below
and
the
respondents
assume
that
that
letter
is
essentially
an
ungranted
request
for
a
change
in
the
statute
with
respect
to
damage
actions.
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
letter.
the
letter
says
there
will
be
less
confusion
if
you
didn't
use
that
language.
you
could
make
it
absolutely
unmistakable
that
money
damage
suits
against
officers
are
not
included,
but
the
letter
goes
on
to
say
“this,
we
assume,
is
in
accord
with
the
purpose
of
the
committee
of
the
congress.”
now,
i
think,
mr.
justice
white
had
the
better
of
the
argument.
it
may
be
that
the
congress
kept
the
phrases
in
by
pride
of
authorship
or
whatever
other
reason,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
then
deputy
attorney
general
white,
probably
had
the
better
of
the
argument
about
what
would've
made
the
statute
absolutely
clear,
but
he
was
not
--
you
can't
read
that
letter
to
mean
that
he
was
asking
them
to
make
a
change,
which
they
then
refused
to
make.
now,
as
to
the
memorandum
by
attorney
general
katzenbach,
that's
a
memorandum
which,
of
course,
is
not
part
of
the
legislative
history
because
it
went
out
after
the
statute
had
passed,
went
out
under
his
name.
it
was
a
seven-page
memorandum
that
went
out
to
the
various
offices
of
us
attorneys,
explaining
the
author
of
the
memorandum's
view
of
what
the
statute
meant.
there's
no
blinking
the
fact
that
it
says
it
covers
liable
and
slander
actions,
and
we
think
that
it's
wrong
that
the
legislative
history
is
powerful
evidence.
otherwise
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
isn't
part
of
the
legislative
history
and
it
simply
doesn't
have
the
same
weight.
if
attorney
general
katzenbach
had
included
that
in
the
letter
to
the
congress
before
this
--
before
the
act
was
passed
and
said
“this
is
what
we
assume
what
you're
trying
to
and
we
don't
want
you
to
do
it”
and
congress
had
then
passed
the
act,
i
think
we
would
not
be
here
today,
but
that's
not
what
happened.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
the
president
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
i
think
the
pre
--
i
think
that
indicates
the
understanding
of
the
president
and
his
advisers
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
what
he
was
signing
was
a
bill
which
extended
to
the
district
courts,
the
jurisdiction
hereto
enjoyed
solely
by
the
district
court
of
columbia.
i
think
he
assumes,
as
we
say
the
reports
read,
that
this
bill
and
the
venues
--
including
the
venue
section
is
only
concerned
with
the
types
of
suits
which
could
formally
have
brought
--
been
brought
only
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
something
has
also
been
said
about
the
letter
that
lawrence
walsh,
deputy
attorney
walsh,
wrote
to
the
committee.
this
was
very
early
and
i
think
you
have
to
put
that
in
perspective.
deputy
attorney
general
walsh
had
before
him
to
comment
on,
at
that
time,
the
original
bill,
hr10089,
which
spoke
only
to
suing
officers
in
their
official
capacity
and
did
not
extent
mandamus
jurisdiction,
had
no
subject
matter
extension.
he
just
remarked
on
the
bill,
“well,
it
looks
to
me
as
if
this
bill
won't
do
what
you
want
it
to
do
because
it
won't
extend
mandamus
jurisdiction.”
he
also
observed
that
it
wouldn't
cover
the
two
types
of
suits
which
could
then
be
brought
against
federal
officers
individually.
one
of
which,
was
damage
suits,
the
other
of
which,
were
injunction
suits
where
you're
naming
them
individually
to
get
around
sovereign
immunity.
he
said
“i
assume
this
is
not
the
committee's
concern.”
now,
in
fact,
he
was
wrong
about
the
second
category,
but
he
was
right
about
the
first
category
as
the
subsequent
hearings
and
the
explanation
of
the
phrase
“under
color
of
legal
authority”
in
all
--
in
the
house
report
show.
so,
to
put
a
lot
of
weight
on
what
he
says
in
that
letter,
operating
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
process
or
to
interpret
it
as
showing
that,
somehow,
the
government
was
arguing
with
them
at
that
point
and
ask
--
begging
them
not
to
include
money
damage
suits
i
think
would
be
--
would
put
in
improper
interpretation
on
that
particular
bit
of
legislative
history.
i
think,
in
summing
up,
we
submit
that
construing
a
federal
statute
such
as
this
involves
more
than
looking
at
its
words
and
consulting
a
dictionary.
this
court
has
said
in
schla
--
has
said
in
cases
such
as
american
trucking
associations
such
as
train
versus
colorado
public
interest
research
group,
that
it's
not
going
to
stop
that
language
which,
upon
superficial
examination,
might
tend
to
go
in
favor
of
one
party.
each
statute
has
a
history
in
the
plain
meaning
doctrine.
it's
not
a
warrant
for
disregarding
what
that
history
tells
us.
we
submit
that
what
the
history
of
1391
(e)
tells
us,
seen
it
in
its
entirety
and
not
as
a
source
of
extractable
fragments,
is
clear.
congress
wanted
to
make
it
possible
for
the
aggrieved
citizen
in
idaho
to
challenge
actions
of
his
government
without
going
to
the
district
of
columbia
to
do
so.
to
litigate
his
rights
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
or
to
compel
a
forest
service
officer
to
issue
a
permit
to
him
out
there
if
it
was
the
duty
of
the
officer
to
do
so,
the
judgments
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
the
venue
expansion
bill,
the
representative
hamer
budge
first
introduced
in
the
86th
congress
would
not
had
if
enacted
have
covered
suits
like
the
ones
here
today.
yet,
applied
only
to
suits
against
federal
officers
in
their
official
capacity
and
at
the
opening
of
the
hearings
on
that
bill
in
the
86th
congress,
representative
budge
described
the
kinds
of
suits
and
the
kind
of
venue
problem
he
was
concerned
with
in
terms
that
clearly
exclude
the
kinds
of
suits
we
have
here
today.
respondents
contend
and
the
court
below
found
that
by
adding
the
phrase
“under
color
of
legal
authority,”
the
committee
considering
representative
budge's
bill,
thereby
extended
the
venue
provision
to
include
these
types
of
tort
damage
suits.
we
believe
that
in
examination
of
the
circumstances
under
which
this
phrase
got
add
into
the
legislation
and
emerged
in
the
revised
bill
h.r.
12622,
that's
the
subject
of
the
--
of
the
report
issued
in
the
86th
congress
reveals
that
they're
wrong.
and
we
submit
that
the
conclusion
deserved
from
this
--
derive
from
this
examination
of
circumstances
is
confirmed
by
the
explanation
of
the
phrase
in
--
which
is
supplied
in
both
house
reports,
the
one
issued
in
the
86th
congress
and
the
one
issued
in
the
87th
congress.
and
by
remarks
of
representative
poff,
who
is
a
member
of
the
subcommittee
that
considered
that
bill
in
the
86th
congress
and
who
made
remarks
in
the
87th
congress
when
the
bill
was
initially
passed
by
the
house
containing
this
phrase
“under
color
of
legal
authority.”
and
i'm
going
to
devote
most
of
point
time
here
to
discussing
how
this
phrase
got
into
the
bill
and
how
it's
explained
in
the
house
reports
and
what
congressman
poff
said
this
bill
was
all
about
when
he
explained
it
to
his
fellow
congressmen.
as
i
said,
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
--
on
the
original
bill
in
the
89th
congress
because
that's
where
the
phrase
came
in
and
that's
where
some
of
these
troubles
since
then
have
first
appeared
in
that
report.
regarding
that
original
bill,
it's
true
as
mrs.
peterson
has
said
here
this
morning
that
deputy
attorney
general
walsh
had
written
a
letter
to
the
congress
about
that
original
bill
that
mentioned
only
official
capacity.
and
he
pointed
out
that
it
appeared
to
cover
only
mandamus
actions
the
bill
therefore
knew
nothing,
because
no
court
outside
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
mandamus
jurisdiction.
he
also
did
mention
that
there
were
two
categories
of
cases
involving
suits
against
defendants
and
their
individual
capacity
as
federal
officers
and
their
individual
capacity
which
would
not
be
covered
by
the
bill
as
drafted.
one
category
of
suits
was
the
suits
against
the
individual
where
you
were
--
you
had
a
legal
fiction
that
the
man
was
acting
outside
of
his
authority
in
order
to
evade
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
the
other
category
of
suits
was
--
were
suits
to
seek
damage
from
him
personally
for
actions
taken
ostensibly
on
the
course
of
his
official
duties
but
which
the
plaintiff
claims
were
in
--
excessive
of
official
authority.
in
the
hearings
on
representative
budge's
bill,
macguineas
reiterated
these
points
and
he
again
pointed
out
that
one
category
of
these
suits
involved
this
legal
fiction.
in
view
of
representative
budge's
opening
statement
of
what
he
intended
the
bill
to
cover,
it
was
quite
obvious
that
this
first
category
of
suits,
the
legal
fiction
category
had
to
be
covered
in
order
for
representative
budge's
bill
to
do
what
he
wanted
to
do.
and
that
was
to
give
review
of
administrative
action
out
in
the
field
against
field
officers
without
having
your
action
foreclosed
because
the
indispensable
superior,
party
superior
was
in
washington.
therefore,
if
they
didn't
put
something
in
the
bill,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
bill
was
going
to
be
undermined.
the
phrase
“under
color
of
legal
authority”
was
suggested
by
committee
counsel
melvin
drabkin.
and
it's
true
that
he
had
times
in
the
hearing
seem
to
distinguish
suits
--
personal
suits
for
personal
actions,
personal
--
outside
the
scope
of
employment
actions
against
federal
defendants.
but
he
also
said
at
page
57
of
the
hearings
to
macguineas,
"i
don't
want
the
government
to
be
able
to
retreat
behind
any
artificial
concepts."
so,
what
he
seem
to
fear
was
that
something
was
going
on
here,
if
they
didn't
change
it
in
some
way,
the
government
was
going
to
somehow
escape
review.
and
it
is
true
that
macguineas
pointed
out
that
if
you
added
this
phrase
“under
color
of
legal
authority,”
there
was
the
danger.
the
possibility
that
some
court
might
construe
it
to
cover
tort
damage
suits
against
the
officials.
and
then
he
said
quite
forcefully
that
this
would
be
grossly
unfair
to
federal
officials
because
certainly,
private
individuals
are
not
subject
to
suits
in
multiple
forums
for
torts
committed
in
the
course
of
their
employment
and
it
was
unfair
to
--
to
treat
federal
officials
differently
for
damage
suits.
and
slander
actions
were
discussed
as
--
as
a
sort
of
paradigm
case
of
these
types
that
--
of
suits
that
might
possibly
be
covered.
however,
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
discussing
this
--
this
possibility,
the
committee
chairman
and
another
committee
member
immediately
agreed
that
it
would
be
unfair.
this
was
representative
forrester
and
representative
poff
and
that's
at
page
63
of
the
transcript
of
hearings.
but
the
congressman
had
several
reasons
to
discount
macguineas'
fears
that
the
courts
would
construe
the
language
to
reach
this
result
that
they
agreed
with
was
--
was
unfair.
first,
judge
albert
maris
who
--
representing
the
judicial
conference
testified
really
something
of
an
expert
witness,
they
seem
to
treat
him
as
someone
who
knew
how
courts
might
interpret
things
and
who
knew
what
language
should
be
used
to
--
to
achieve
their
purposes,
and
he
was
asked,
"would
it
be
advisable
to
add
this
phrase
under
color
of
legal
authority?"
and
he
said,
"i
would
be
very
happy
to
see
that,
because
it
would
be
a
way
of
putting
to
rest
this
fictional
doctrine
and
get
right
down
of
what
is
really
the
fact
reviewing
administrative
action."
that's
at
page
91
of
the
transcript
of
hearings.
second,
they
had
reason
to
discount
this
possibility
that
macguineas
was
holding
up
to
them
because
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
hamer
budge,
disavowed
on
the
record
any
intent
of
covering
what
he
called,
the
slander
type
actions.
he
said,
"this
is
not
what
i
have
in
mind."
and
as
justice
steven
has
pointed
out,
that
was
mainly
what
they
focused
on
when
they
were
giving
examples
of
what
damage
actions
might
possibly
be
involved.
third,
the
house
report
issued
shortly
after
these
hearings
concluded
explained
the
reason
for
referring
both
the
suits
against
officers
acting
in
their
official
capacity
and
the
suits
against
offers
--
officers
acting
under
color
of
legal
authority
and
that
explanation
which
is
printed
at
page
37
of
our
brief
and
in
language
that
has
been
quoted
this
morning
by
mr.
nemser
is
written
in
terms
that
clearly
not
referred
to
these
types
of
suits
but
clearly
refer
to
suits
in
essence
against
the
government
suits,
in
essence
against
the
united
states
suits
that
involve
this
legal
fiction.
now,
we
submit
that
--
that
these
factors,
these
circumstances
would
have
made
the
congressman
feel
that
perhaps
macguineas
was
being
unnecessarily
finicky,
unnecessarily
fearful.
clearly
they
thought
he
was
there
trying
to
throw
up
problems
to
dissuade
them
from
legislating
anything
at
least
they
seem
to
express
that
feeling
at
times.
and
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
on
h.r.
1960
in
the
87th
congress,
started
out
describing
the
purpose
of
the
bill,
the
bill
--
the
bill
as
a
whole,
not
just
the
mandamus
section,
but
the
bill
as
a
whole
is
being
something
that
they're
passing
to
facilitate
review
of
administrative
action.
and
we
submit
that
damage
suits
are
not
what
you're
talking
about
when
you
talk
about
review
of
administrative
action.
congressman
poff,
made
remarks
in
connection
with
this
bill
when
it
was
voted
on
by
the
house
in
the
87th
congress.
now,
this
is
--
when
it
was
first
voted
on
by
the
house,
there
were
subsequently
some
amendments
which
don't
directly
affect
us
here
and
it
was
then
revoted
on
by
the
house
but
--
but
he
was
explaining
to
the
congress
that
was
going
to
pass
on
this
bill
what
it
meant.
and
at
this
time,
it
did
contain
a
phrase
under
legal
--
“under
color
of
legal
authority.”
representative
poff's
remarks
which
are
printed
at
volume
107
of
the
congressional
record,
page
12157,
"are
cast
in
terms
that
refer
only
to
suits
that
are
in
essence
against
the
government
itself."
he
speaks
of
the
balance
of
convenience
between
plaintiff
and
defendant
in
such
suits,
and
insists
that
broadening
the
plaintiffs'
options
presents
no
problem,
because
as
he
observes,
there
are
federal
courts,
federal
attorneys,
federal
marshals,
and
federal
agencies
in
every
quarter
of
the
nation,
and
that
in
fact
the
convenience
of
the
government
would
be
promoted
by
trying
the
case
in
the
local
district
court
where
the
paper
is
available,
the
property
is
accessible,
and
the
witnesses
are
within
easy
reach.
representative
poff
ended
his
remarks
with
the
following
statement,
"our
nation
was
founded
upon
a
profound
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
individual
citizen.
the
government
should
be
willing
always
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
preservation
of
these
rights
more
particularly,
when
the
government
is
the
party
in
controversy
with
the
private
citizen."
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
right.
and
what
you're
reviewing
is
government
action.
we're
not
seeking
to
have
some
kind
of
damage
and
compensation
for
some
injury
that
was
done
to
you
in
the
past.
you're
reviewing
the
action,
and
generally,
you're
asking
for
injunctive
relief.
make
him
stop
--
do
it,
don't
let
him
do
it
again,
and
getting
some
ruling
on
whether
it's
a
legal
action
or
not.
the
damage
suits
here
today
are
not
controversies
between
the
government
and
respondents
in
these
cases.
they
are
suits
for
damages
to
be
paid
out
of
assets
of
the
individual
petitioners.
in
this
case,
mr.
colby
and
mr.
walters,
who
as
pointed
out,
are
now
private
citizens.
it
is
true
that
they
have
been
supplied
with
government-paid
private
counsel,
but
as
noted,
that
is
not
assured
in
all
cases.
there
are
these
factors
that
have
to
be
satisfied,
that
there's
a
determination
that
they
were
acting
in
the
scope
of
their
employment,
that
there's
a
determination
that
it's
in
the
interests
of
the
united
states
to
provide
representation
to
them.
and
as
far
as
the
private
counsel
program,
private
counsel
are
paid
for
when
there's
some
possibility
of
conflict
in
representing
all
of
the
defendants,
or
some
other
problem
with
arguments
that
might
wish
to
be
raised,
or
any
other
factors.
this
is
not
assured
at
all,
because
this
is
subject
to
annual
budgetary
appropriations
which
may
or
may
not
come
about
from
year
to
year.
so
there
simply
cannot
be
any
assurance
that
government
representation
is
always
there.
in
fact,
i
think
at
one
point
in
the
transcript,
there
was
some
reference
to
suits
against
congressmen,
and
one
of
the
representatives
said
to
macguineas,
don't
you
always
defend
these?
and
he
said,
“well,
sometimes
we
do
and
sometimes
we
don't.”
so
it
wasn't
assured.
it
is
easy
to
see
in
retrospect
that
greater
care
might
have
been
taken
by
congress
to
assure
that
courts
would
not
construe
1391
(e)
more
broadly
than
congress
evidently
intended.
but
we
submit
that
the
language
that
congress
did
employ,
"under
color
of
legal
authority"
is
not
in
itself
so
clearly
indicative
of
an
attempt
to
change
this
historic,
defendant-oriented
venue
rules,
that
you
simply
ignore
all
of
these
other
considerations
that
i've
discussed
here.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
you
mean
at
the
time?
in
other
words,
refers
to
his
capacity
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that
certainly,
your
honor,
i
think
is
suggestive
of
an
intent
to
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
i
think
that
the
petitioners
may
have
suggested
that
to
the
first
circuit.
but
as
i
understand
your
honor,
that
if
it's
read
that
way
it's
clearly
suggestive
of
having
some
kind
of
active
supervision
over
their
--
what
they're
doing,
and
it's
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--
suggestive
of
injunctive
relief,
certainly.
and
i
think
that's
a
plausible
reading
of
the
statute.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
--
i
would
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
would
never
want
to
resist
an
argument
that
would
tend
to
support
the
position
that
we're
supporting.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
alright,
and
i'm
advised
that
it's
in
petitioner's
brief
at
page
5.
in
--
in
summary,
i
would
just
simply
like
to
note
that
we
think
that
the
circumstances
that
i've
noted
here
really
compellingly
suggest
what
the
congressional
purpose
was
in
this
statute.
and
that
any
memorandum
that
attorney
general
katzenbach
may
have
written
three
months
later
or
--
and
certainly
the
letter
of
deputy
attorney
general
white
which
can
be
read
as
merely
to
say,
there
might
be
a
problem,
the
courts
might
construe
this
way,
you
might
consider
making
it
more
clearly
are
not
enough
to
compel
the
really
radical
change
in
venue
rules
which
the
construction
given
to
the
statute
by
the
respondents
and
by
the
court
below
would
effect.
thank
you
your
honor.
