justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
any
exemption,
you
feel
we
have
to
decide
the
equitable
feature
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
not
my
question,
now
my
question
is
do
we
have
to
decide
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet
your
question
presented
in
your
own
belief
is
this,
may
a
private
right
of
action
at
law
for
damages
be
implied
under
the
investment
advisers
act?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
has
to
deal
with
that
case
and
i'm
asking
again,
whether
we
have
to
decide
the
equity
aspect
to
us?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
should
we
decide
this
in
the
first
place?
why
should
we
decide
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
the
words
prospective
client?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
say
much
about
those
in
your
brief.
