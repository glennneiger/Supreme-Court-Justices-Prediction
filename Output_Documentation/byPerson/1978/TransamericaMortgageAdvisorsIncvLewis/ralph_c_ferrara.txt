mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
believes
that
an
implied
remedy
for
damages
caused
by
violations
of
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
investment
advisers
act
is
consistent
with
the
act's
legislative
scheme
and
necessary
to
achieve
effectively
its
goals.
as
you
have
already
heard,
a
primary
congressional
purpose
underlying
the
enactment
of
the
investment
advisers
act
particularly
its
anti-fraud
provisions
was
to
eliminate
fraud
in
overreaching
by
investment
advisers
abuses
which
had
compromised
the
interest
of
advisory
clients
and
derogation
of
the
delicate
fiduciary
nature
of
an
advisory
relationship.
judicial
recognition
of
an
implied
rate
of
action
here
will
effectuate
that
congressional
goal.
far
from
interfering
with
the
act's
regulatory
scheme
or
its
enforcement
by
the
commission
in
the
manner
explicitly
provided
for
in
the
statute,
section
206,
i'm
sorry,
implying
a
right
of
action
under
section
206
the
advisers
act
would
serve
as
necessary
supplement
to
governmental
action.
without
a
private
remedy,
statutory
objectives
would
be
frustrated
congressionally
provided
protections
for
advisory
clients
will
be
significantly
diminished.
like
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
section
206
of
the
advisers
act
is
a
general
anti-fraud
provision
and
across
the
board
prohibition
of
the
countless
varieties
of
deceptions
and
cutting
devices
to
which
clients
have
investment
advisers
might
be
subjected
and
all
who
need
the
statutory
definition
of
advisor
including
those
who
are
exempt
from
registration
by
the
commission
are
covered.
section
206
is
therefore
a
provision
intended
and
structured
by
the
legislators
to
provide
broad
protections
to
the
clients
of
investment
advisers.
to
the
clients
of
investment
advisers,
congress
clearly
articulated
a
federal
right
in
that
special
class.
because
of
this
specific
congressional
purpose,
section
206
in
some
respects
is
more
limited
than
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
section
10
(b)
of
the
exchange
act.
for
example,
section
206
is
limited
in
its
applicability
to
an
advisor's
relationship
with
his
client.
on
the
other
hand,
the
limitations
contained
in
section
10
(b)
at
the
fraud
being
connection
with
the
purchase
and
sale
of
a
security
is
not
a
prerequisite
since
congress
recognized
that
fraud
by
advisor
may
take
forms
which
should
not
always
directly
relate
to
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities.
thus,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
repeatedly
emphasizes
the
need
to
protect
the
special
class
of
clients
from
unscrupulous
and
fraudulent
practices.
by
1940
of
course,
congress
had
enacted
a
full
panoply
of
securities
lost
which
were
in
part
designed
to
prevent
fraudulent
practices
yet
congress
proceed
the
deficiency
and
the
legislative
scheme
and
that
it
was
not
as
effective
at
it
could
be
in
preventing
the
types
of
abuses
that
a
grown
up
in
the
investment
advisory
field.
congress
intended
to
remedy
this
deficiency
and
this
court
has
directed
lower
courts
that
it
is
their
duty
to
provide
such
remedies
are
necessary
to
effectuate
the
congressional
purpose.
it
is
therefore
significant
to
the
commission
that
each
of
the
three
appellate
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue
presented
here
and
the
overwhelming
number
of
district
courts
that
have
done
so
have
concluded
that
a
private
remedy
is
both
appropriate
and
necessary
to
achieve
the
goals
underlying
the
investment
advisers
act.
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
has
stated
in
the
wilson
case,
there
are
no
less
drastic
and
more
closely
tailored
means
by
which
to
do
so.
we
submit
that
the
many
courts
that
have
considered
this
issue
have
been
faithful
to
the
court's
direction.
there
are,
as
this
court
has
pointed
of
course,
circumstances
in
which
a
private
remedy
would
not
only
fail
to
contribute
to
furthering
the
legislative
scheme
but
would
also
actually
interfere
with
congress'
intent.
but
we
do
not
have
in
these
circumstances
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
an
assertion
of
a
private
remedy
by
one
that
the
statute
was
meant
to
regulate
as
we
had
in
the
piper
case.
here
the
clients
of
the
advisers
were
intended
to
benefit
from
the
statute
and
that's
who's
bringing
the
action
nor
do
we
have
a
situation
in
which
private
enforcement
would
not
be
harmonious
with
the
exercise
of
the
enforcement
powers
entrusted
to
governmental
agencies
as
well
as
the
case
in
amtrak
and
barbour.
it
has
been
the
commission's
consistent
experience
that
even
where
allegations
in
the
separate
private
damage
action
parallel
the
commission
action
and
on
enforcement
proceeding,
private
remedies
do
not
interfere
with
their
own
enforcement
activities
and
of
course
many
private
actions
are
brought
where
the
commission
does
not
or
because
of
limited
resources
could
not
institute
its
own
proceeding.
we
recognize
of
course,
that
in
administrative
institutional
invitations
alone
do
not
justify
the
implication
of
private
remedies
but
an
appreciation
of
the
dimensions
of
the
enforcement
fraud
problems
faced
by
the
commission
and
how
that
problem
has
changed
through
the
years
is
useful
to
an
understanding
of
the
depths
of
the
problems
that
are
faced
today.
as
in
borak,
one
measure
of
the
necessity
for
a
private
action
is
to
provide,
i
should
say,
is
provided
by
the
scope
of
the
practical
problems
that
the
agency
faces
in
attempting
to
administer
the
act.
in
1940,
the
investment
adviser
industry
was
indeed
to
fledgling
profession
that
emerged
in
response
to
depression
and
the
public's
perceived
need
for
investment
expertise
to
supervise
his
investments.
but
that
fledgling
profession
has
experience
dramatic
growth
since
1940
and
recent
statistics
indicate
that
that
is
a
continuing
trend.
in
1941,
barely
750
advisers
registered
with
the
commission
under
the
investment
advisers
act
as
compared
to
approximately
6,000
broker
dealers
that
were
registered
with
the
commission
back
in
1941.
currently,
the
commission's
records
put
the
number
of
registered
investment
adviser
and
that
is
not
the
entire
universe
of
adviser
but
the
number
of
registered
investment
advisers
at
5500,
almost
equaling
the
number
of
registered
broker
dealers.
perhaps,
even
more
indicative
of
the
importance
of
the
advisory
industry
to
the
nation's
affairs
international
economy
is
the
growth
of
the
assets
under
advisement.
well
the
number
of
adviser's
increases
sevenfold
since
1941,
the
amount
of
assets
under
advisement
has
increase
50
times.
today,
there
are
$200
billion
under
advisement
and
it
must
be
taken
into
account
that
unlike
overseeing
and
disciplining
the
broker
dealer
community
where
the
exchange
act
provided
for
a
commission
and
self-regulatory
partnership
and
enforcing
the
act,
the
commission
must
bear
the
primary
responsibility
for
regulating
and
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
investment
advisers
act.
moreover,
the
enforcement
of
role,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
extends
to
all
those
who
meet
the
definition
of
adviser
including
the
many
advisers
who
exempt
from
the
act's
registration
provisions.
for
various
reasons
not
limited
to
the
scarcity
of
available
resources,
the
commission
must
carefully
choose
the
cases
it
brings.
even
in
those
cases,
it
does
bring
moreover,
it
is
normally
impossible
for
the
commission
to
obtain
redress
for
undue
to
investors.
as
mr.
justice
stevens
had
pointed
out,
it
is
fundamental
to
our
adversary
system
that
selfish
interests
of
litigants
provide
the
best
guarantee
that
a
claim
will
be
effectively
asserted.
certainly,
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
placement
so
effective
as
the
one
whose
pocketbook
is
affected
by
the
degree
to
which
he
enforces
the
law.
as
we
have
pointed
out,
many
of
the
reasons
was
compelled
like
a
conclusion
that
a
private
rate
of
action
should
be
available
on
the
advisers
act
also,
i'm
sorry,
i
mean
the
exchange
act
also
militate
for
the
conclusion
that
a
private
action
should
be
provided
under
the
advisers
act.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
indeed
i
suppose
the
commission
would
prefer
to
see
the
case
decided
on
the
narrowest
ground.
principally
because
we
have
been
told
and
we
understand
that
implied
actions
are
not
favored.
however,
i
think
that
in
this
case,
although
the
relief
prayed
for
is
basically
equitable
relief,
damages
are
also
prayed
for
and
we
thank
that
it
probably
this
would
be
a
good
time
to
resolve
the
question
of
whether
there
is
an
implied
remedy
under
the
investment
advisers
act
then
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
yes,
a
distinction
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
right.
no,
indeed
the
distinction
could
be
drawn,
judge
gurfein
in
dissenting
in
the
abrahamson
case
in
the
footnote
seemed
to
suggest
that
have
the
abrahamson
case
been
an
equitable
action
or
an
action
for
equitable
relief,
that
action
might
have
gone
forward
and
be
implied
under
section
206
and
to
this
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
yes
and
in
this
action
sensed
the
principally
prayed
for
as
an
junction,
recession,
restitution,
on
accounting
as
well
as
damages.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
yes.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
assisting
me
in
clarifying
my
response
to
you,
the
commission
believes
that
this
case
could
be
decided
solely
by
treating
the
equitable
question,
unless
you
have
to
be.
now
if
the
court,
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
understand
that.
if
the
court
chose
to
decide
the
action
just
in
the
basis
of
the
equitable
or
chose
to
decide
the
case,
i
simply
the
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
briefly.
we
would
follow
the
direction
of
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
the
piper
case
where
he
asked
as
one
of
the
criteria
that
we
utilize.
in
that
case,
if
there
was
a
less
drastic
means
by
which
to
provide
the
remedies
that
were
needed
to
fulfill
the
congressional
purpose
and
mr.
justice
burger
might
say
in
analogy
to
piper
case
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
we
would
agree
that
if
the
court
shows
a
less
drastic,
if
the
court
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
we
urge
the
court
to
find
an
implied
right
of
action
under
section
206
of
the
advisers
act.
but
should
the
court
choose
to
find
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
for
legal
and
equitable
relief,
however
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
we
do
indeed.
however,
we
recognize
that
should
the
court
wish
to
find
only
that
an
equitable
remedy
should
be
implied
under
section
206
it
could
do
so.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
indeed
they
do
not
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
correct,
we
generally
see
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
--
the
protection
of
the
economic
interest
of
clients
is
the
very
point
of
prohibitions
against
adviser
fraud.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
commission
normally
seeks
prospective
equitable
relief
in
getting
an
injunction.
a
private
litigant
seeking
equitable
relief
oftentimes
as
in
this
case
would
seek
rescission,
reinstitution,
and
accounting
and
to
some
extent
reinstitution
is
the
equitable
analogue,
i
believe,
of
damages.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
yes?
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
--
mr.
--
it
would
be
the
third,
sir
that
is
whether
or
not
the
action
was
consistent
with
the
underlying
legislative
scheme.
that
is
the
way
that
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
no,
but
i'm
suggesting
is
that
in
providing
a
gloss
over
the
four-part
cort
test
and
the
piper
case,
i
believe
that
this
court
suggested
in
focusing
on
cort
factor
three,
that
is
whether
the
action
is
consistent.
this
court
asked
an
additional
question
and
that
is,
whether
or
not
the
action,
a
private
action
could
go
forward
in
a
less
drastic
fashion
than
to
seek
for
legal
damages
and
since
there
was
no
response
in
that
case
they
found
in
part
that
the
third
fact
to
the
cort
test
had
not
been
met.
i
think
in
this
case,
should
the
court
wish
to
take
that
approach,
should
that
court
raised
to
provide
that
gloss
of
piper
on
cort
against
ash,
it
could
decide
at
a
minimum,
the
third
degree
or
third
criteria
of
the
cort
test
could
be
met
by
providing
equitable
relief.
however,
we
believe
that
the
court
should
decide
the
broader
question
and
that
is
whether
there
is
an
implied
right
of
action
generally
under
the
investment
advisers
act.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
would
like
to
talk
about
the
five
cases
this
court
decided
last
term
that
bear
on
this
case,
cannon,
touche,
kidwell,
burks
against
lasker,
davis.
but
before
i
do
that,
i
have
listened
to
mr.
anderson
on
two
occasions
twist
this
case
and
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
few
of
the
things
that
he
said
before
launching
it
to
my
argument
in
chief.
first,
somehow
mr.
anderson
seems
to
think
that
the
touche
ross
opinion
decided
last
term
clothes
section
214
with
some
kind
of
special
significance
for
his
case.
if
touche
ross
stands
for
anything,
it
stands
for
the
fact
that
jurisdictional
provisions
like
section
214
create
no
duties,
create
no
liabilities
and
if
there
are
duties
and
liabilities
to
be
created
or
to
be
recognized,
you've
got
to
go
to
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
statute.
that's
the
anti-fraud
provision,
section
206
here.
i
think
it's
inexplicable
that
he
thinks
that
touche
ross
helps
his
case.
secondly,
he
on
three
occasions
to
the
course
of
his
principal
argument
says
that
there
is
no
indication
of
the
legislative
history
that
congress
affirmatively
intended
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action.
that's
not
the
test.
cannon
and
touche
affirm
that
that's
not
the
test.
mr.
justice
stevens
in
the
course
of
the
--
writing
the
majority
opinion
in
cannon
said
that
that
case
was
atypical,
that's
the
word
he
used,
"atypical",
and
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
rather
significant
indication
of
legislative
intent
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action.
and
mr.
justice
white,
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
disagreed
with
that.
and
it
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
--
i
understand
the
quote,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
oh,
not
at
all.
we
embrace,
as
we
do
in
our
brief,
both
the
cannon
and
touche
standards.
we
understand
that
this
court
wants
to
treat
questions
of
recognizing
private
rights
of
action
under
federal
statutes
that
don't
expressly
provide
for
one
as
an
issue
of
statutory
construction.
and
we
think
that
this
court
in
cannon
and
touche
gave
us
the
guidelines
to
go
about
the
business
of
engaging
in
statutory
construction.
the
guidelines
that
the
court
gave
us
in
determining
that
threshold
question
of
congressional
intent
are
clearly
articulated
in
touche.
mr.
justice
stevens
in
cannon
said
it's
that
right
duty
creating
part
of
the
--
let
me
--
let
me
slow
down.
mr.
justice
stevens
said
in
cannon
that
it
is
that
right
or
duty
creating
language
in
the
statute
that
is
the
best
indication
of
whether
a
private
right
of
action
should
be
implied.
that's
the
cannon
of
statutory
construction
that
this
court
i
think
in
both
cannon
and
touche
have
chosen
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
right
of
action
should
be
implied.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
--
i
think
that's
too
short
a
standard,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
the
threshold
inquiry
is
determining
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
was
in
a
special
class.
i
think
this
court
said
in
cannon
where
to
look
for
the
right
duty
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
--
if
--
if
this
court
would
like
to
say
the
right
is
implied,
i
would
agree
with
it.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
no.
i
--
i
say
that
that's
the
starting
point
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
right
should
be
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
this
court
has
said
in
cannon
and
touche
that
once
you've
answered
that
threshold
question
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
then
this
court
is
going
to
be
decidedly
receptive
to
implying
a
cause
of
action
when
it
is
necessary
or
at
least
helpful
to
effectuating
the
underlying
congressional
purposes.
that,
i
think,
this
court
said
in
both
of
those
cases
as
the
next
step.
and
we
think
that
this
case
needs
that
next
step
also.
beyond
that,
the
court
has
said,
if
you
want
to
regard
it
as
a
sub-step
of
2,
the
court
has
said
that
it's
going
to
be
decidedly
receptive
to
implying
a
right
of
action
if
failing
to
do
so
would
undermine
the
statutory
purpose.
we
think
we
meet
that
test
too.beyond
that,
the
court
said
as
a
third
test,
if
you
will,
that
it
was
going
to
be
decidedly
receptive
to
implying
a
private
right
of
action
when
an
explicit
right
is
created
on
behalf
of
a
benefitted
class,
but
there
is
not
an
opportunity
for
that
benefitted
class
to
access,
to
intervene,
to
activate,
to
participate
in
the
administrative
machinery
created
under
the
statute.
we
meet
that
test
too.
that
i
think
is
the
--
is
the
refocusing,
the
refurbishing
of
cort
against
ash
that
--
that
cannon
and
touche
provide
and
i
introduced
the
--
the
subject
of
the
davis
case
also
in
my
opening
remark.
we
think
that
that
bears
on
this
too.
because
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
that
case,
writing
for
the
majority,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
cause
of
action
under
a
statute
is
analytically
distinct
from
the
question
of
relief.
so
all
of
that
cannon-touche
language,
all
of
the
--
the
new
mode
of
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
congress
intended
a
right
of
action
should
be
implied
all
focuses
on
the
question
of
cause
of
action,
as
quite
properly
it
should.
well,
continuing,
mr.
--
mr.
anderson
also
seems
to
think
that
or
take
some
great
comfort
in
the
1970
amendments
to
the
investment
company
act,
creating
an
expressed
right
of
action
under
section
36
(b).
but
he
omits
to
tell
the
court
that
congress
said
in
both
the
senate
and
house
reports,
as
i
recall
it,
to
those
1970
amendments
to
the
investment
company
act
that
it
had
absolutely
no
intention
to
adversely
affect
implied
remedies
under
other
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
laws,
particularly
the
investment
company
act
or
i
think
the
investment
advisers
act.
he
raises
the
1976
amendments
to
the
--
or
proposed
amendments
to
the
investment
advisers
act.
but
he
doesn't
tell
you
there
that
congress
considered
those
1976
amendments
merely
to
confirm
what
it
understood
to
be
the
fact
that
actions
have
been
implied
and
properly
so
under
section
206
of
the
investment
advisers
act.
mr.
anderson
says
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
the
respondents
in
this
case
seek
--
seek
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
merely
by
some
analogy
to
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
an
obvious
reference
to
borak.
well,
that's
just
not
the
case
at
all.
we've
submitted
a
22-page
supplemental
brief
indicating
that
we're
quite
comfortable
living
under
cannon,
quite
comfortable
living
under
touche,
quite
comfortable
living
under
davis
and
quite
frankly
relieved
that
burks
even
helps
this
case.
mr.
--
mr.
anderson
seems
to
think
that
the
sec
doesn't
place
great
credence
in
what
he
calls
the
policy
arguments.
that
there's
no
purchase
and
sale
here
involved.
well,
we
think
that
--
i'm
sorry,
he
--
he
says
that
not
only
that
we
don't
place
great
credence
to
that
but
that
our
entire
argument
rests
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
he
says
the
sec
seems
to
sit
on
its
hands
saying
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
require
a
purchase
and
sale
accordingly.
all
of
those
marvelous
policy
considerations
that
the
court
articulated
in
blue
chip,
marvelous
from
his
perspective,
the
sec
completely
disregards.
well,
it's
just
not
true.
in
blue
chip
--
i
should
say
this
case
is
--
is
substantially
different
than
blue
chip.
here,
there's
a
clear
transactional
nexus
between
the
plaintiff
and
defendant.
i
mean
they
have
--
they
have
a
privity
of
contract
between
them.
they
have
an
investment
adviser
and
a
client
to
that
investment
adviser,
much
different
than
blue
chip.
here,
you
have
a
very
definite
limited
class
of
potential
plaintiffs,
expressly
identified
in
the
statute.
the
statute
talks
in
terms
of
clients
of
investment
advisers.
it's
not
a
statute
that
talks
in
terms
of
the
general
public,
the
kind
of
person
who
could
be
sitting
by
the
wayside
and
a
purchase
and
sale
securities
transaction
that
blue
chip
was
worried
about.
also,
there's
no
remote
expectation
of
contingent
liabilities
in
a
case
like
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
anderson
in
the
course
of
his
opening
remarks
suggested
that
in
the
commission's
brief,
pages
41
through
45,
we
embrace
the
notion
that
a
prospective
client
should
also
have
an
implied
right
of
action.
i
don't
recall
that
our
brief
does
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission's
position
is
that
allegations
of
fraud
presuppose
that
there
has
to
be
the
existence
of
a
client-adviser
relationship.
now,
certainly
fraud
can
induce
a
party
into
becoming
a
client
of
an
adviser,
but
the
commission's
position,
the
commission's
view
is
that
before
an
action
can
be
maintained,
a
person
is
going
to
have
to
demonstrate
that
at
the
time
of
the
action
or
at
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
the
fraud
that
he
was
a
client.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
if
you
mean
a
written
contract
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
--
signed
by
both
parties.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
we
--
we
think
that
there
has
to
have
been
an
advisory
relationship
entered
into
a
formal
advisory
relationship
so
that
you
have
a
client
status
and
an
adviser
status
in
existence.
the
prospective
client
language,
we
think,
was
added
by
congress
merely
to
be
able
to
cover
the
situation
where
the
plaintiff
before
he
becomes
a
client
is
induced
to
become
a
client
on
the
basis
of
fraudulent
misrepresentations
and
that
prospective
client
language
is
important
for
the
sec
that
has
as
its
--
as
part
of
its
enforcement
machinery
the
obligation
to
go
in
and
bring
injunctive
actions
to
prevent
frauds
that
are
about
to
occur.
so
the
prospective
client
language
is
very
important
for
the
sec
language
but
not
we
think
particularly
relevant
to
or
--
or
particularly
complicating
for
this
court
in
determining
whether
clients
should
have
an
implied
right
of
action
under
section
206.
finally
--
let's
see
here
--
well,
having
--
having
discussed
briefly
mr.
anderson's
position,
i'd
now
like
to
turn
to
--
to
our
argument.
as
i
--
as
i
said
briefly
in
--
in
part
into
responding
to
some
of
the
points
that
mr.
anderson
raised,
this
court
has
characterized
last
term
and
defined
what
it
calls
the
threshold
question
in
determining
whether
a
private
right
of
action
should
be
implied
or
recognized
under
a
federal
statute
not
explicitly
providing
for
one.
and
that
threshold
question
was
identified
by
the
court
to
be
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
or
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
--
was
within
the
special
class
meant
to
be
protected
by
the
statute.
we
think
we've
--
that
section
206
in
its
language,
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
thing
that
mr.
justice
stevens
writing
for
the
majority
of
the
court
said
we
had
to
look
to,
the
language
of
the
statute
creates
federal
rights
in
favor
of
a
particularized
class
of
defendants
or
--
i'm
sorry,
i
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i'd
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
--
i
not
only
concede
that,
i
agree
with
it.
i
think
its
--
i
think
it's
not
--
that's
exactly
what
this
court
has
said.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it's
a
question
of
statutory
--
congressional
intent.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
because
this
court
has
decided
that
it
no
longer
wants
to
engage
in
the
policy
based
reasoning
that
got
us
to
borak
with
a
case
that's
been
characterized
in
an
opinion
of
this
court
last
term
as
being
apparent
and
incomprehensible
as
a
matter
of
policy.
policy-based
reasoning
supporting
the
implication
of
implied
rights
of
action
is
apparently
out.
statutory
construction
in
defining
the
intent
of
congress
is
apparently
in.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
quite
--
quite
frankly,
mr.
justice
white,
the
commission
will
be
just
as
happy
to
have
policy-based
reasoning.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
(voice
overlap)
you
don't
have
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
my
view
is
that
this
court
was
far
better
suited
when
it
based
its
implication
decisions
on
policy
--
the
policy-based
reasoning
of
borak.
however,
we
are
perfectly
comfortable
with
having
the
--
the
statutory
construction
rule
that's
been
articulated
in
cannon
and
touche.
and
--
and
i'm
not
the
one
who
said
that
congressional
--
that
determining
what
the
ultimate
congressional
intent
is,
is
the
proper
test.
that's
the
test
this
court
has
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it
is
not
a
question
of
jurisdiction
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
--
because
the
jurisdiction
under
28
u.s.c.
1331
and
214
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
i
think
--
i
think
if
you're
asking
me
to
under
--
to
explain
the
rationale
of
the
court's
decisions
in
cannon
and
touche,
i
would
respond
by
saying,
mr.
justice
white,
that
there's
a
concern
on
the
part
of
the
court
that
it
not
engage
in
--
in
breaches
of
what's
been
characterized
as
a
separation
of
powers
provision
of
the
constitution.
the
court
does
not
want
to
be
in
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
absolutely.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could
stand
up
here
for
another
one
hour
and
try
to
persuade
you
that
the
rationale
of
borak
was
correct
and
this
court
should
be
drawing
on
broader
policy-based
considerations,
i'd
love
to
do
so.
but
i
just
don't
think
for
--
for
some
reason
that
it's
going
to
do
me
a
lot
of
good.
