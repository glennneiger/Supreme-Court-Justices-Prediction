justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
--
i
get
it
from
your
position
that
you've
come
out
differently
on
the
equitable
and
legal
questions
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
argued
that
you've
--
you
just
but
you
just
argued
the
legal
question
in
your
opening
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
and
you
think
you
must
come
up
the
same
on
both
issues,
legal
and
equitable.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it
proposed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
draw
any
distinction
between
legal
and
equitable
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
brief
--
and
your
brief
seems
to
indicate
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
also
in
the
text
of
a
dissenting
opinion,
i
think
that
seem
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tell
me
though,
tell
me
why
you
think
in
terms
of
whether
there's
an
implied
private
cause
of
action,
there
could
be
some
of
the
distinction
drawn.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
as
whether
there
might
be
some
difference
as
to
whether
you
needed
the
jurisdictional
amount.
but
i'm
talking
about
the
private
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
answered
my
question
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
put
to
you
differently.
why
should
you
get
a
different
and
how
could
you
get
a
different
answer
on
the
legal
side
and
on
the
equitable
side
in
terms
of
the
private
cause
of
action?
just
briefly.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
urge
the
court
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
what?
both
legal
and
equitable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
the
act
should
be
construed
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
say
--
do
you
say
as
long
as
you've
got
the
right
duty,
a
substantive
language
in
the
statute,
you
must
find
in
the
statute
some
--
some
affirmative
evidence
that
congress
did
not
intend
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
all
you
find
--
if
that's
all
you
find
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
rest
of
the
statute
and
you
find
no
other
evidence
of
any
kind
except
that
there's
that
substantive
right
or
duty,
you
would
say
the
right
is
implied.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
thought
that's
what
you
said
though
a
moment
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
concede
in
the
--
in
these
kinds
of
cases
the
bottom
line
has
to
be
that
we
conclude
that
congress
intended
to
create
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
private
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that
essential
too?
why
--
why
is
that
bottom
line
essential
that
congress
must
intend
to
create
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
you
find
a
statute
that
everybody
would
agree,
creates
--
purports
to
protect
a
class
of
people
and
create
some
rights
in
them
that
somebody
is
going
to
attempt
to
protect
under
the
statute.
and
they're
perfectly
identifiable
and
the
right
is
clear,
now
why
do
you
need
a
congressional
intent
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
--
i
just
want
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
i
wonder
what
your
view
of
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
a
question
of
jurisdiction,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
right
is
stated
under
the
federal
statute.
now
why
do
you
need
--
why
do
you
need
some
--
some
further
license
from
congress
to
get
into
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
just
assumes
the
answer
that
you
can't
get
into
court
unless
congress
tells
you,
that
lets
you
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
if
--
why
is
congress
--
if
it's
clear
enough
that
an
act
that
congress
created
some
protection
for
a
class
of
people
and
--
and
created
some
duties
on
behalf
of
one
group
in
favor
of
another,
why
do
you
have
to
--
and
then
you
have
the
--
then
you
have
the
jurisdictional
provisions
in
the
federal
court,
why
do
you
need
some
other
evidence
from
congress
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
--
that
one
--
that
people
protected
have
to
--
have
a
right
to
go
into
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
that
it's
clear
in
the
act
that
--
that
there
are
some
duties
created
by
congress,
some
duties
placed
on
one
group
in
favor
of
another.
that's
just
perfectly
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
--
and
they
say
nothing
at
all
about
getting
into
court
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
asking
you,
why
--
why
do
you
need
some
other
evidence
from
congress
that
the
people
protected
have
to
have
a
separate
license
from
congress
to
get
into
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why?
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that's
--
that's
just
bootstrapping
on
--
based
on
our
cases.
i
just
want
--
you're
talking
about
--
i
want
to
know
about
what
you
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
find
some
evidence
in
the
statute
or
its
structure
or
unless
--
that
congress
affirmatively
didn't
intend
--
that
they
intended
to
keep
them
out
of
court.
