chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
transamerica
mortgage
advisors
against
lewis.
we'll
just
give
the
audience
a
few
minutes
to
clear,
counsel.
i'm
just
really
not
interested
in
implied
causes
of
action.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
mr.
anderson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
it
be
more
likely
that
the
public
authority
would
seek
the
equitable
relief
than
private
in
the
general
run
of
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
isn't
any
compulsion
on
the
court
to
treat
them
on
an
all
or
nothing
basis,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
would
be
equitable
relief
only,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
keisman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ferrara.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
equitable
remedies
sometimes
don't
put
any
money
in
anyone's
pocket,
is
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
commission
isn't
so
much
concerned
about
putting
money
in
people's
pocket
so
as
stopping
a
wrongdoing
that's
ongoing,
isn't
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
more,
mr.
anderson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
eight
minutes
and
if
you
needed,
we'll
ran
through
your
rebuttal
entirely
before
the
break.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
transamerica
mortgage
advisors
against
lewis.
mr.
anderson,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
professor
loss
in
his
testimony
suggest
that
congress
should
do
just
that,
just
leave
the
matter
open
and
let
--
let
the
courts
decide
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
relief
could
the
commission,
the
sec
secure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
equitable
relief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
keisman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
possible
changes
in
legislative
practices
over
the
period
since
dean
thayer
was
talking
might
have
something
to
do
with
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wasn't
really
thinking
of
the
code
problem.
i
was
thinking
of
practical
day
by
day,
hour
by
hour
practices
of
the
congress
of
today
as
compared
with
the
congress
of
a
100
or
even
50
or
30
years
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
for
example
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
when
--
when
congress
in
one
of
these
cases
that
we
had
provided
for
attorney's
fees
to
be
allowed
to
the
private
litigant,
that
was
thought
to
be
enough
to
suggest
that
it
was
mere
inadvertence
that
they
hadn't
provided
for
an
express
and
explicit
private
right
of
action.
but
otherwise,
doesn't
the
--
professor
loss'
approach
leave
an
enormous
amount
of
discretion
to
the
courts
on
what
are
essentially
policy
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
congress
understands
that
private
actions
must
be
created
explicitly,
doesn't
this
problem,
the
long
range
problem
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
work
itself
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
why
i've
said
long
range.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ferrara.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
courts
--
courts
have
recognized
rights
of
action,
causes
of
action
without
waiting
for
congress
to
say
yea
or
nay
on
the
subject,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
is
whether
in
the
framework
of
a
particular
statute
we
are
forced
to
rely
on
statutory
construction
and
not
draw
on
broader
powers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
the
red
light
doesn't
permit
you
to
do
so
anyway.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
anderson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
77-1645,
transamerica
mortgage
advisors
against
lewis
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
