mr.
eric
l.
keisman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
sharing
our
time
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
we
will
concentrate
our
all
aspects
of
the
case
except
the
third
of
the
cort
against
ash
criteria.
the
necessity
or
the
importance
of
supplementation
of
government
activity
which
area
would
be
covered
primarily
by
the
government
in
the
time
it
has
to
argue.
we
would
like
to
state
first
by
re-identifying
this
case.
the
complaint
in
this
action
is
primarily
and
always
was
a
classic
bill
inequity
seeking
a
declaration
of
rightness
of
a
contract
between
an
investment
adviser
and
the
advisee
to
wit
the
mortgage
trust
of
america
which
we've
called
in
our
brief
mta.
it
also
seeks
restitution
of
the
consideration
paid
under
that
contract.
on
the
grounds,
that
the
contract
was
at
all
times
in
violation
of
the
investment
advisers
act
at
1940
including
section
206
and
of
course
that
relief
arises
under
215
bill
of
the
act
providing
the
contracts
in
violation
of
the
act
to
practices
under
contracts
and
violation
of
the
act
are
void.
this
is
the
primary
relief
sought
in
this
action
and
always
was.
now,
the
respondent
has
said,
some
of
this
is
moot
because
we
never
sought
preliminary
relief
even
though
the
contract
has
been
re-moot.
it
was
rather
difficult
to
move
for
preliminary
injunction
on
the
basis
on
the
complaint.
it's
been
dismissed
for
one
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
equitable
relief
sought
is
in
no
sense
moot,
it
is
the
government
of
the
action.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
the
sense
very
narrowly
and
quite
properly
it
reached
only
the
issue
otherwise
before
it.
the
district
court
had
dismissed
the
complaint
for
one
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
finding
that
there
was
no
private
right
of
action
under
the
advisers
act
no
matter
how
cast.
and
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
therefore
it
reversed
and
said
that
in
the
proper
case
there
could
be
a
private
right
of
action
for
injunctive
relief,
equitable
relief
or
damages
and
it
got
no
farther.
it
adopted
the
rational
of
abrahamson
because
abrahamson
is
a
very,
very
different
case.
abrahamson
was
a
suit
that
could
only
be
characterized
as
suit
at
worth
the
money
damages
arising
out
of
participations
in
a
hedge
fund.
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
that
case,
in
abrahamson
and
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
we
respectfully
contend
that
this
would
be
a
peculiar
case
and
at
most
a
futile
record
in
which
to
attempt
to
re-litigate
abrahamson.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
i
draw,
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
no
improper
intimation
it
holds
nothing.
it
holds,
i
believe
only
that
the
court
did
not
consider
that
case
of
sufficient
importance
to
warrant
at
the
time
it's
reviewed.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
quite
so,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
what
i'm
saying
here,
however,
is
that
this
is
not
abrahamson
and
the
petitioners
to
a
certain
degree
seemed
to
stress
that
they
like
to
re-litigate
all
the
questions
in
abrahamson.
but
those
questions
aren't
here.
this
is
not
a
suit
primarily
from
money
damages.
this
suit
does
not
raise
the
question
whether
in
order
for
there
to
be
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
this
court
must
allow
an
action
cast
in
law.
this
is
not
to
say
that
we
don't
think
it
is
proper
to
imply
such
as
an
action
and
i
will
get
within
the
next
couple
of
minutes
to
the
question
where
there
anything
at
all
much
as
anything
important
is
to
be
drawn
from
whatever
happen
to
section
214
as
the
advisers
act
in
the
few
weeks
that
it
was
considered
by
a
committee
but
presented
really
nearly
to
the
floor
after
some
rather
rapid
redrafting
in
the
summer
of
1940.
but
at
the
very
least,
the
relief
we
say
a
bill
in
equity
which
what
this
case
is
lies.
now,
we
have
agreed
that
the
cort
against
ash
criteria
that
is
the
commission
have
agreed
to
cast
argument
among
those
lines.
and
we
think
the
first
of
the
criteria
expressed
by
this
court
whether
the
statute
in
question
was
passed
for
the
special
benefit
of
a
particular
class
of
persons
and
whether
as
this
court
itself
explained
that,
that
means
whether
it
creates
a
federal
right.
now,
we
think
that
in
this
instance
that
the
advisers
act
creates
a
federal
right
on
behalf
of
the
clients
of
investment
advisers
within
the
context
of
the
advisory
relationship.
it
is
obvious
and
manifest
and
we're
not
going
to
belabor
it
what
is
in
our
brief.
this
court
itself
from
the
capital
gains
research
bureau
case
analyzed
the
meaning
based
on
debt
the
passage
of
the
advisers
act.
nothing
has
happened
in
the
interim
to
change
that
analysis.
congress
was
concerned
about
the
relationship
interest
they
say
between
the
advisor
and
the
client
advisee.
it
was
not
concerned
in
passing
the
advisers
act
in
all
due
respect
to
petitioners
with
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities
by
the
advisor
on
behalf
of
the
advisee.
it
was
concerned
and
it
was
seriously
concerned
with
the
relationship
interest
they
say.
one
of
the
things
in
the
legislative
history
perhaps,
very
significant
in
this
case
which
one
of
the
things
congress
expressed
its
concern
about
in
both
the
senate
reports
and
house
report
was
the
kind
of
compensation
arrangements
that
advisors
dealt
with
themselves
with
their
advisees.
were
they
as
the
fcc
have
warned
in
this
1939
state
dealing
themselves
compensation
arrangements
which
encourage
them
to
go
out
to
and
take
onto
investors.
now,
the
most
common
in
those
days
were
contingent
ones
which
are
of
course
prohibited
as
to
registered
advisors.
more
common
today
and
the
--
were
yesterday
is
another
brief
era
of
the
ascendancy
of
the
real
estate
investment
trust
was
the
compensation
contract
based
at
least
in
part
upon
undisbursed
commitments
which
encourage
the
practice
of
heavy
forward
committing,
borrowing
(inaudible),
with
incurring
reverse
leverage
so
that
in
order
to
expand
your
fee
base
you
borrowed
money
for
more
than
you
could
get
for
it
if
you
had
committed
sufficiently.
now,
of
course
much
of
that
is
no
longer
important
in
the
investment
community.
but
the
interface
relationship,
the
way
a
compensation
arrangement
in
a
designed
was
definitely
a
concern
of
both
houses
congress
at
least
the
cognizant
committees
in
1939
and
1940.
now,
the
special
benefit
whether
was
no
other
beneficiary
of
this
act
except
of
course
for
the
sovereign
interests
in
that
integrity
of
securities
markets
in
the
health
of
the
capital
markets.
the
class
of
persons
whether
individual
or
corporate
or
some
other
kind
of
entity
to
be
protected
and
congress
said
it
again
and
again
each
of
the
reports
in
the
hearings
and
senator
wagner's
statements
was
to
protect
the
investors.
this
is
obvious.
what
form
of
remedies
they
might
seek
is
no
part
of
the
question
much
less
the
answer?
once
the
federal
right
is
created,
it
is
nothing
uncommon
for
the
legislature
to
leave
a
method
of
its
protection
to
the
courts.
we
contended
it
has
long
been
accepted
by
legislatures
that
the
special
genius
for
designing
remedy
is
judicial.
very
often
the
legislative
attempt
to
foresee
what
kinds
of
violations
of
the
general
terms
of
the
statute
will
occur.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
i
begin
with
once
a
federal
prohibition.
i'm
not
trying
to
imply
my
conclusion
and
my
premises
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i'm
saying
that
federal
positive
law
enacted
by
the
congress
says
that,
practices
that
operate
as
a
fraud
or
deceit
by
advisors
upon
advisees.
at
the
very
least,
if
they're
in
the
contractual
relationship
result
in
void
contracts,
and
a
void
contract
not
only
under
this
court's
comment
in
deckert
against
independent
shares,
the
second
circuit's
holding
in
goldstein
against
groesbeck,
and
this
court
commented
part
and
again
in
the
blue
chip
case.
void
means
voidable
at
the
instance
of
the
party
aggrieved.
no
other
meaning
is
current
or
has
been
within
the
century
in
the
anglo-american
legal
system.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
contract
is
void
at
the
option
of
the
government.
i
believe
this
court
has
made
that
clear
nor
does
it
mean
that
the
contract
is
void
if
none
tries
to
do
anything
about
it.
it
has
frequently
been
read
that
void
means
voidable
in
a
way
this
reduces
the
strictures.
the
party
aggrieved
if
it
so
wishes
can
seek
not
to
take
its
remedy.
it
must
assert
its
remedy.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
it
can
defend
--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
isn't
a
reading
for
which
even
the
petitioner
has
been
able
to
cite
any
authority.
if
they
--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
well,
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
court's
interpretation,
its
proper
interpretation
of
section
like
250
and
this
section
29
(b)
of
the
exchange
act
and
the
second
circuit's
interpretation
of
26
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
require
a
vast
change
in
the
law
if
we're
now
to
say,
oh
no,
all
250
(b)
means
that
it
can
be
used
defensively.
those
who
make
the
statute
meaningless--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
well,
the
first
statement
which
i'm
well
aware
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
in
deckert
which
in
turn
cites
authority
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
and
it
says
that
they're
voidable
at
the
instance
of
the
party
aggrieved
is
that
it's
also
the
teaching
of
groesbeck.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
i
think
it
was
an
alternate
holding
in
kardon.
i
believe
that
the
holding
in
kardon
relied
most
strictly
on
the
then
doctrine
of
the
restatement
of
torts,
simply
what
we've
contended
in
our
brief
is
the
proposition
that
the
court
property
starts
with.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
the
safety
appliance
act,
rigsby,
and
of
course
way
back
to
couch
against
steel
and
dean
thayer's
commentaries
that
when
federal
positive
law
is
created
--
right
positive
law
is
created
thing
such
an
act
or
omission
is
criminal
or
otherwise
wrongful
as
against
such
persons.
then
it's
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
the
civil
process
as
well
as
the
sovereign
penal
process
to
imply
a
remedy
with
respect
to
thereto
to
the
party
aggrieved.
now,
the
petitioners
here
we
think
recognize
this
because
they
met
a
method
exigesis
upon
a
free
word
admission
from
section
214,
the
special
federal
question
jurisdiction
subsection.
as
we
believe
we
have
developed
perhaps
some
of
those
two
exhaustively
in
our
brief
section
214
as
known
to
floors
no
legislative
history
worthy
of
the
name.
section
214
as
known
to
the
floors
of
the
house
and
the
floor
of
the
senate
as
described
to
it
in
the
committee
reports
that
came
to
the
floor
is
described
as
being
comparable
to
the
provisions
containing
the
investment
company
act.
whether
every
section
entitled
to
the
advisers
act
after
section
207
is
so
described
comparable.
if
a
member
of
the
senate
or
a
member
of
the
house
going
more
than
ordinary
curious,
i
might
have
try
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
investment
company
act
to
the
senate
and
house
support
on
this
as
happen
one
as
thus,
same
package.
and
then
he
would
have
been
told
that
section
44
of
the
companies
act
contained
the
usual
provision
about
jurisdiction.
now
if
the
intent
of
congress
is
the
intent
of
either
house
and
not
the
intent
of
some
draftsmen
working
for
someone
on
same
said
committee.
then,
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
the
sovereign
body
of
congress
with
respect
to
214
as
what
it
intended
to
do
what
it
had
done
before.
now,
it
suggested
to
it
and
even
if
a
member
read
the
committee
reports
and
read
the
committee
hearings.
there
was
nothing
in
any
of
those
that
carried
the
remotest
suggestion
that
anyone
had
ever
made
a
conscious
change.
they're
meant
to
do
anything
other
than
what
they
had
done
before.
there
is
no
factual
historical
explanation
that
says
why
at
some
point
on
some
day
214
was
drawn
precisely
the
way
it
was.
historically,
the
most
rational
is
that
for
a
long
time
as
went
to
the
rapid
spring
and
summer
1940
drafting
these
laws,
large
pieces
of
title
i
and
title
ii
the
formal
theses
jurisdiction
venue
offenses
procedure
had
been
picked
up
from
the
1935
act
in
and
put
in
badly.
perhaps,
this
is
a
way
of
saving
time.
there
was
apparently
some
desire
to
get
this
work
done.
at
some
point--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
i'm
sorry,
the
trust
indenture
act.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
at
some
point,
the
industry
protested
that
this
bill
was
sloppy
in
effect.
this
was
what
actually
happened
that
title
i
and
title
ii
should
be
separated
that
section
should
be
written.
one
of
three
sections
were
written
and
we
have
a
committee
print
pops
up
now
with
sections
all
neatly
done
for
title
i
and
title
ii.
no
comment
on
any
of
them;
not
the
slightest
on
the
floor.
now,
to
create
a
monumental
doctrine
to
say
that
the
advisers
act
shall
be
different
from
all
their
acts
because
of
this
bit
of
draftsman's
trivia
and
against
with
the
floors
of
each
house
that
enacted
this
bill
without
substantial
dissent
were
told
is
an
excuse
for
an
exegesis.
it
is
now
a
valid
reason
for
an
exegesis
for
different
result
for
change
and
the
consequences
of
the
board
heavy
front
provision
of
the
advisers
act
as
opposed
to
the
consequences
of
section
10
(b)
or
more
to
the
point
rule
10
(b)
(5).
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
in
piper,
this
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
defeated
tender
offeror
in
that
capacity
was
not
a
member
of
the
class
protected
by
the
williams
act.
mr.
justice
stevens,
i'm
aware
that
you
did
not
concur
in
that
position
but
i
think
that
the
cases
are
nonetheless
distinguishable
as
they
didn't
come
down
or
as
we
contend
this
one
should
come
down.
in
that,
there
was
an
argument
and
the
argument
was
recognized
and
to
put
another
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
company
seeking
to
take
over
another
as
it
were
the
predator
was
to
take
the
balance
in
the
way
different
than
congress
had
in
mind.
the
williams
act
was
enacted
because
the
congress
expressed
great
concern
at
the
rush.
companies,
conglomerates,
other
aggressive
corporations
to
take
over
others.
the
williams
act
was
passed,
of
course
what
makes
it
a
more
difficult.
now,
if
the
predator
as
it
were
could
sue
not
only
his
competitor
but
it's
the
logic
appeared
to
be
could
assume
the
target
company.
if
it
fought
back
hard
and
slipped
into
some
of
our
mission
in
the
race
and
then
perhaps
seven
to
10
days
it
takes
to
mount
what
the
financial
press
used
to
call
the
saturday
night
special.
while
the
target
companies
resistance
might
be
weakened
beyond
a
reason,
the
fear
that
a
well-mounted
and
powerful
attacks
even
to
take
you
over
it.
well,
the
management
may
not
fight
back
anyway.
if
they
do
fight
back
because
for
some
reason
for
saying,
well,
no,
we're
not
going
to
give
any
of
the
predator
a
chance
to
use
williams
act
in
any
way
predator's
on
his
own.
this
is
not
this
case,
here
we
have
--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
so
they
--
though
the
result
expressed
in
terms
of
court
criterion
for
whether
this
should
be
remitted
to
the
state
court,
we
submitted
we've
argued
in
our
brief
for
actual
words
of
conclusion
that
riding
on
the
conclusion
as
to
criterion
number
one
that
the
overall
was
not
within
the
class
protected
and
that
really
could
perhaps
have
been
the
end
of
it.
now,
in
the
time
remaining
i
would
simply
like
to
stress
that
the
problems,
the
tremendous
policy
problems
start
to
arrive
out
of
allowing
federal
protection
of
an
advisee
by
his
advisor
for
breach
of
what
congress
recognized
was
a
fiduciary
relationship.
and
a
fiduciary
relationship
a
federal
concern
this
court
pointed
that
out
in
green
against
santa
fe.
congress
has
superimposed
under
a
new
fiduciary
relationship
positive
one
with
respect
to
what
is
the
breach
of
this
kind
of
fiduciary
duty.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
easy
job
of
the
federal
judiciary.
as
to
limitations,
as
to
scienter,
again,
the
second
circuit
knows
all
about
scienter.
it
decided
abrahamson.
it
also
decided
drexel.
scienter
has
always
been
a
part
of
fraud
point.
as
to
whether
things
--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
well,
it
may
have
erred
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
that
case
but
we
respectfully
suggest
that
as
to
the
proper
elements
in
the
206
offense
there's
no
reason
to
think
to
the
second
circuit
would
be
any
more
open-ended
that
it
was
under
10
(b)
(5),
the
williams
act
was
something
rather
new
at
the
time,
sir.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
these
problems
are
the
problems
that
are
properly
those
of
the
district
courts
to
delineate
the
elements.
they
are
not
before
this
court
and
they
are
not
in
the
record.
we
have
very
little
of
a
record
here
of
pleading
dismissed
for
one
of
jurisdiction.
if
this
is
not
the
job
of
the
central
judiciary,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
at
least
went
in
some
doubt
as
to
what
that
job
is.
the
pretended
harsh
of
the
flooded
litigation
--
no,
petitions
are
found
perhaps
15
cases
in
7
years.
the
judicial
conference
reports
that
130,000
private
federal
civil
actions
were
found
last
year.
the
number
of
times
that
the
federal
judiciary
would
have
to
concern
itself
about
fraudulent
conduct
by
an
interstate
advisor
by
an
advisor-advisee
investors
on
the
national
scale
very
small
probably
less
frequently
there
has
to
consider
the
terrible
burden
of
doing
a
litigation
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
burden
isn't
there.
the
hochfelder
problem
isn't
there,
the
blue
chip
problem
isn't
there.
the
universe
of
clients
are
people
in
a
contractual
relationship.
a
prospective
client
who
doesn't
enter
into
relationship
isn't
going
to
be
defrauded.
that's
a
chivalrous.
we're
not
going
to
have
suits
for
damages
arising
out
of
the
false
advertisement
for
taut
sheet
that
someone
didn't
buy.
prospective
client
could
be
defrauded
if
he
becomes
a
client,
perhaps
that
it
may
become
a
client.
but
the
problem
isn't
really
there.
the
problem
is
it's
fictional.
this
is
fictional
as
the
asserted
datum
of
which
this
court
was
presented
--
with
regard
to
suits
against
real
estate
trust
as
we
put
it
out,
the
only
verifiable
datum.
the
only
reported
case
cited
is
mis-cited.
one
case
presented
as
involving
an
unjust
settlement
as
it
happens
we
we're
able
to
inspect
the
file
because
my
friend
is
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
there.
and
the
case
was
settled
after
the
trustees
and
the
trust
fund
it
settled.
there
is
no
problem
of
burden
and
there
is
a
duty
in
the
court
which
we
respectfully
submit
should
be
met.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
we
too
think
it
is
appropriate
to
begin
this
reargument
by
calling
attention
to
what
this
case
is
and
what
therefore
is
actually
and
necessarily
before
this
court
for
decision.
this
is
an
action
brought
derivatively
by
a
shareholder
of
a
real
estate
investment
trust
against
its
investment
adviser,
certain
of
the
trustees
of
the
trust,
the
parent
of
the
adviser
and
a
sister
corporation
alleged
to
have
been
a
party
to
the
transactions
alleged
to
be
fraudulent.
now,
in
discussing
the
issues
before
the
court,
we
are
again
dividing
time
with
the
government,
the
sec,
and
subject
to
the
court's
desires
and
questions,
we
intend
to
focus
on
the
case,
what
the
statute
does
by
necessity,
by
implication,
and
the
legislative
background
against
which
the
statute
was
enacted.
the
commission
will
emphasize
again
subject
to
the
court's
questions,
the
appropriateness
within
the
enforcement
picture
of
a
private
remedy,
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
the
administrative
machinery
and
the
appropriateness
of
implications
of
private
remedy,
and
the
inapplicability
of
doctrines
such
as
those
arising
from
amtrak
and
sipc
against
barbour.
again
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
case
is
as
i
argued
last
spring,
in
its
principal
cause
of
action,
classically
equitable
in
the
substantive
form.
now,
there's
no
quibble
that
merger
happened
and
that
merger
started
out
as
a
procedural
doctrine,
has
continued
to
be
a
procedural
doctrine.
i
think
there
is
also
no
quibble
that
the
substantive
law
recognizes
in
the
nature
of
relief
available
and
the
nature
of
defenses
available,
there
is
still
such
a
thing
as
a
claim
equitable
in
its
character,
in
its
substantive
character.
although
one
is
not
demurrable,
if
one
pleads
the
inequity
in
a
thing
called
a
complaint.
we
can't
plead
laches
in
a
complaint
for
goods
sold
and
delivered
and
you
can
plead
laches
in
a
bill
for
restitution
and
rescission.
and
its
primary
cause
of
action,
this
is
a
bill
for
rescission
of
a
contract
alleged
to
be
the
product
of
a
fraudulent
scheme
and
plan
for
restitution
of
the
compensation
or
at
least
the
excess
compensation
paid
thereunder.
even
contains
the
partial
seeds
of
a
partial
equitable
defense.
that
is
that
the
full
restitution
of
all
compensation
would
be
something
for
a
court
sitting
--
as
a
court
of
equity
to
consider
if
all
of
the
services
rendered
could
not
be
tendered
back
for
what
they
were
worth.
so
what
is
actually
before
this
court
and
what
can't
--
be
not
decided,
given
that
certiorari
has
been
granted,
is
whether
an
equitable
action
arises
by
necessary
implication
or
proper
implication
through
section
206
of
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940.
now,
cannon
against
the
university
of
chicago,
i
think,
teaches
us
that
the
cort
against
ash
analysis
wholly
appropriate
to
use.
but
as
we
were
so
bold
as
to
suggest
in
our
first
brief,
the
four
criteria
are
not
independent.
they
are
not
four
points
to
count
on
a
scoreboard.
the
second
through
fourth
illuminate
the
first.
and
while
there
has
been
a
difference
in
the
expression
of
analysis,
this
really
doesn't
differ
from
what
the
courts
did
a
100
years
ago,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
through
our
distinguished
dean
thayer,
who
said
the
reason
we
look
to
imply
claims
from
wrong
arising
under
statutes
is
because
in
an
appropriate
kind
of
case,
and
he
was
talking
about
the
kind
of
case
where
standard
of
safety
or
a
standard
of
decency
had
been
established
by
a
legislature,
not
to
do
so
would
be
to
fail
to
offer
appropriate
respect
to
the
other
branch
of
the
government.
there
was
no
discontinuity
between
the
cases
at
common
law,
the
cases
under
early
federal
statutes,
and
the
case
at
bar.
there
was
a
difference
in
approach
and
analysis,
perhaps
a
tighter
and
more
careful
view
of
greater
recognition
when
it
arises
of
the
problems
of
federalism.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
to
a
certain
degree,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
may
be
that
this
has
become
a
little
bit
more
of
a
code
nation
that
it
was.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
that
is
--
that
in
some
cases,
and
perhaps
increasingly
the
congress
is
willing
to
take
the
risk
of
spelling
out
all
of
the
elements
of
a
special
kind
of
cause
of
action
that
it
wants
to
create.
but
at
least
in
1940,
and
i
think
i
only
have
to
speak
principally
to
1940
and
not
to
1979,
this
was
not
a
code
country.
there
were
experiments
with
codes.
but
as
we've
argued
before,
we
think
it
perfectly
clear
that
congress
created
under
some
of
the
securities
acts
specific
hybrid
forms
of
action
for
specific
wrongs,
its
study
of
which
had
given
rise
to
the
1933
and
1934
and
1935
acts.
it
likewise
created
certain
open-ended
provisions
saying
again
and
again
in
its
legislative
history
we
don't
know,
for
example,
what
kind
of
fraud
is
going
to
happen.
professor
loss,
in
one
of
the
treatise
sections
we
cite
in
our
original
brief,
picks
up
i
think
the
appropriate
metaphor
for
an
oregon
state
court
that
if
we
codify
the
law
of
fraud,
the
that
oregon
court
said,
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
gentleman
that
would
sit
up
overnights
finding
ways
to
commit
three
but
not
the
fourth
element
of
such
fraud.
a
certain
amount
of
open-endedness
and
non-codification
of
the
law
of
fraud
was
recognized
by
the
legislation
to
be
necessary
to
avoid
codifying
the
avoidance
of
any
penalty
for
fraud.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
oh,
that
may
be
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
with
respect
to
section
206,
we're
talking
about
1940.
and
respectfully,
i
don't
think
there
had
been
any
change,
certainly
no
change
that
invalidates
anything
that
this
court
said
in
cort
against
ash
or
in
cannon.
we
start
with
what
kind
of
a
statute
it
is.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
and
this
is
a
code
--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
enormous
is
a
question
of
characterization.
i
don't
think
it's
a
problem.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
i
don't
think
it's
a
problem
here.
i
don't
think
it's
a
problem
here
because
there
is
a
much
stronger
indication
of
congressional
intention
that
some
private
litigation
arise
from
the
advisers
act
--
directly
in
the
advisers
act.
there
is
a
section,
section
215
(b)
which
says
that
any
contract,
any
practice,
the
continuation
of
any
relationship
that's
in
violation
of
a
substantive
provision
of
this
title
is
void.
the
courts,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
deckert,
in
citing
deckert
and
blue
chip
and
other
cases,
softened
the
blow
of
the
word
"void"
so
that
it
doesn't
mean
no
title
may
pass
and
a
remote
error
of
the
grantor
can't
take
the
land
back.
but
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
least
it
means
is
avoidable
at
the
suit
of
the
party
deceived
or
aggrieved.
now
that's
right
in
the
advisers
act
and
if
one
is
looking
to
decide
as
this
court
so
often
traditionally
has
done,
only
the
case
before
it.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
would
have
to
nullify
section
215
(b)
to
say
that
no
private
litigation
arises
out
of
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
advisers
act.
this
is
a
much
clearer
case,
we
respectfully
submit,
without
other
considerations
we
haven't
dealt
with
yet
than
cannon.
in
cannon,
there's
a
prohibition
against
any
person
being
discriminated
against
on
several
different
bases.
this
court
was
wise
enough
to
realize
that
a
class
of
persons
discriminated
against
even
though
large
was
a
discreet
class
and
it
was
right
creating
language.
here,
we
--
it
is
said
in
206,
no
investment
adviser
shall
defraud
his
client.
that's
a
very
narrow
discreet
class.
the
legislative
history
from
1934
to
1940
is
replete
with
indication
that
the
congress
considered
those
who
provide
capital
for
the
capital
market
to
be
a
discreet
class
in
need
of
special
and
new
protection.
by
the
court
in
cannon
standards,
206
is
far
narrower
than
901,
directed
not
only
to
a
single
kind
of
plaintiff
but
to
a
single
kind
of
defendant.
in
1940
it
was
only
registered
advisers.
in
1960
it
became
any
adviser.
as
to
the
prospective
client
question,
i
think
the
answer
is
simple.
fraud
doesn't
ripen
into
a
cause
of
action
until
at
least
money
passes,
until
the
property
is
fraudulently
taken.
a
prospective
client
could
easily
cover
the
case
where
the
fraud
was
in
the
inducement.
as
one
of
the
things
congress
was
worried
about
touts
and
tipsters.
the
investor
sends
in
his
money,
gets
nothing
back.
the
court
might
say,
"well,
this
isn't
an
advisor-client
relationship.
it's
a
payment
by
fraud
in
the
inducement
or
false
pretenses."
otherwise,
while
the
petitioners
raise
the
horror
of
suits
by
people
who
get
tip
sheets
and
don't
do
anything,
again
this
is
a
fraud
statute.
we're
talking
about
an
economic
fraud
statute.
not
a
statute
for
sending
bad
things
through
the
mail.
the
--
the
problem
doesn't
exist.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he
couldn't
have
been
defrauded
in
any
sense
i
know
in
the
anglo-american
law.
if
he
parted
with
nothing
in
consideration
of
a
fraudulent
--
an
inducement
that
had
a
fraudulent
character
to
make
him
become
a
client
of
an
adviser,
what
economic
tort
could
possibly
have
occurred?
215
we
say
is
a
de
minimis.
that's
almost
professor
loss
finally
went
so
far
i
think
in
his
1969
supplement
to
remark
the
29
(b)
under
the
1934
act
statute
was
more
perhaps
explicit
than
implied.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
what
i'm
arguing
sir
is
that
there's
no
question
congress
expected
some
private
claims
to
be
made.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
this
court
and
most
other
federal
courts
would
deal
with
the
--
we
took
the
(inaudible)
the
same
way
this
court
dealt
with
the
problem
presented
in
--
in
blue
chip.
the
claim
that
nothing
happened
because
somebody
read
something
again
is
not
traditional
fraud
or
deceit.
and
i
think
this
court
would
deal
with
it
as
it
said
in
that
case
that
there
is
a
level
at
which
the
court
must
consider
policy.
and
again
you
can
always
say,
"we
will
do
nothing
that
a
rational
legislator
would
not
have
done."
there
is
that
mode
of
analysis
too.
we
can
say
it
cannot
be
that
the
congress
would've
meant
for
this
to
occur.
and
within
the
rubric
and
within
the
proprieties,
the
courts
would
dispose
of
the
fellow
who
said,
"well,
i
did
nothing.
i
sat
in
my
room
until
my
money
went
away.
this
fellow
told
me
not
to
invest."
i
think
--
again,
215
can
be
read
as
solving
this
case
and
this
case
only.
this
court
need
not
decide
any
other
case
at
this
time.
this
is
not
to
say
that
we
do
not
agree
with
the
government
and
with
this
court
in
touche
ross
to
make
this
perhaps
somewhat
agonizing
distinction
once
you
look
at
what
206
does
on
the
basis
of
214
and
the
omission
of
the
phrase
"actions
at
law".
probably
is
in
keeping
with
the
way
jurisprudence
has
proceeded
since
merger
and
that
once
equitable
jurisdiction
attaches
to
make
the
argument
that
the
question
of
which
of
a
series
of
alternate
remedies
have
been
recognized
as
alternate
for
at
least
a
generation
rises
to
statutory
or
higher
significance
is
a
little
bit
like
trying
to
write
the
declaration
of
independence
on
the
head
of
a
pin
without
a
very
small
needle.
we
showed
in
our
brief
that
214
had
no
history.
we
showed
that
it
wasn't
looked
at.
wasn't
it's
written
up,
wasn't
marked
up.
we
showed
one
thing
more.
we
showed
that
if
how
it
got
passed
meant
anything,
it
means
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
the
petitioner
argued.
why?
because
the
reports
that
came
to
the
floor
on
which
the
majority
voted
said
these
contain
the
usual
provisions
about
jurisdiction
venue
actions.
if
that
meant
anything
to
the
266
votes
and
that
was
necessary
to
carry
the
house,
it
had
to
mean
we're
doing
again
what
we
did
in
1933,
what
we
did
in
1934,
what
we
did
in
1935,
the
holding
company
act,
what
we
did
in
1939,
the
trust
indenture
act.
nobody
suggested
to
the
senate
or
the
house
there
was
any
difference
in
the
procedural
sections
of
the
acts
they
enacted
in
1940.
this
court
has
said
more
than
i
think
it
fit
for
me
to
comment
on,
on
what
we
do
with
things
that
didn't
get
through
congress
but
weren't
rejected
by
it.
so
i'm
not
going
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
why
congress
didn't
amend.
again,
we
cover
that
with
considerable
thoroughness
in
our
brief.
the
investment
--
the
amendment
of
the
investment
company
act
was
a
response
to
a
particular
scandal
and
a
particular
lengthy
investigation
by
the
wharton
school,
university
of
pennsylvania
on
mutual
fund
fees.
and
that's
all
that
the
congress
focused
on
and
what
--
one
of
the
things
they
were
worried
about
was
a
split
of
decision
in
the
courts.
i
think
a
difficult
decision
in
the
second
circuit
where
the
court
to
do
there
what
it
thought
had
to
be
done
and
what
congress
would
have
wanted
it
to
do,
had
to
go
back
and
say,
“well,
we'll
raise
a
private
claim
for
economic
mishandling
under
the
larceny
statute”,
which
is
probably
as
far
as
judge
friendly
has
ever
gone.
and
perhaps
congress
felt
we
better
nail
this
down.
they're
having
trouble
in
the
first
circuit
in
most
of
the
suit
--
but
the
defendants
seemed
to
have
conceded
it,
having
trouble
in
the
second,
let's
lay
it
out,
and
so
they
did.
there
was
no
discussion
in
the
wharton
report
of
general
problems
of
other
kinds
of
investment
advisers.
things
that
don't
come
to
congress'
attention
this
court
has
said
for
a
hundred
years
aren't
part
of
the
history
we
can
interpret.
the
question
has
been
raised
and
we
don't
think
it's
a
proper
kind
of
statutory
interpretation,
will
something
horrible
happen
if
we
read
section
206,
section
215
to
create
a
private
claim.
again,
the
respondent
notes
that
the
petitioner
has
found
15
cases
in
a
dozen
years
and
that
the
judicial
report
tells
us
that
130,000
federal
civil
actions
were
filed
last
year
de
minimis
non
curat
lex,
there
is
no
burden.
as
to
the
elements
of
a
cause
of
action
this
court
has
now
spoken
as
to
what
the
proper
elements
of
an
action
for
fraud
are
and
what
they
aren't.
i
can't
warrant
that
all
lower
courts
will
understand
but
i
would
be
terribly,
terribly
surprised
if
i
could
bring
a
negligence
case
against
an
investment
adviser,
i
really
would.
or
against
as
investment
adviser
who
had
never
entered
into
a
contract
and
never
had
a
client.
i
really
think
that
this
is
more
or
less
asking
this
court
to
not
be
a
court
but
to
be
a
third
house
to
say,
“well,
no,
this
is
the
kind
of
statute.
we've
always
done
this
with
before.”
congress
had
to
mean
that
a
fellow
could
sue
and
set
aside
this
contract
and
get
his
money
back
but
either
might
--
just
be
so
many
suits
even
though
it
never
happened
before,
we'd
better
stop
it
now.
i
respectfully
submit
that
is
not
what
this
court
has
been
doing
in
judicial
administration.
it
has
not
said
that
we
are
not
going
to
enforce
federal
statutes
because
it's
a
problem
to
enforce
federal
statutes.
as
i
said
last
spring,
once
congress
creates
positive
law,
which
i
was
taught
in
school
means
the
command
creating
rights
and
duties,
that
the
designing
of
remedies
is
the
authority
of
the
courts
in
this
country,
in
england,
and
the
federal
courts
as
much
as
the
state
courts.
one
recognizes
that
the
courts
should
not
encroach
on
the
province
of
congress.
but
congress,
we
submit,
expected
the
courts,
certainly
in
1940
and
right
on
perhaps
until
early
this
summer,
with
a
common
anti-fraud
statute
to
do
what
it
had
done
with
other
common
anti-fraud
statutes
directed
toward
classes
that
--
that
congress
had
indicated
needed
special
protection.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
it
may
--
it
--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
it
--
well,
but
it
won't
as
to
the
conditions
of
people
as
against
--
well,
who
have
claims
that
accrued
before
the
summer
of
1979.
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
well,
in
the
long
range,
but
i
respectfully
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
shouldn't
deprive
plaintiffs
who
were
hurt
in
1973.
as
the
commission
correctly
states,
if
this
court
is
serving
notice
on
congress
from
now
on,
except
for
certain
excepted
areas,
and
the
court
isn't
in
cannon,
serving
that
kind
of
notice,
we
will
never
imply
a
remedy.
you've
got
to
codify
the
civil
law.
then
when
that
is
explicitly
done,
no
subsequent
statute
could
--
and
i
suppose,
give
rise
to
any
right
of
implication.
but
i
respectfully
submit
this
court
should
consider
very
carefully
in
terms
of
its
institutional
needs
whether
it
really
means
but
except
in
one
or
two
special
areas,
this
must
be
a
code
country
if
it
wishes
to
create
the
situation
where
the
gentleman
from
oregon,
i
adverted
to
before,
can
have
his
support,
whether
it
wishes
to
try,
for
example,
if
it
must
take
on
codifying
the
sherman
act.
that's
another
statute
that
many
commentators
have
pointed
out
has
become
quasi-constitutional.
it's
a
very
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
well,
quite
--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
quite.
my
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eric
l.
keisman
my
metaphor
was
only
with
regard
to
codifying
all
of
the
substantive
law,
which
if
the
notion
is
you
must
codify
each
private
action,
each
private
remedy,
because
none
may
any
longer
arise
by
implication
then
i
wonder
whether
that
is
really
what
the
court
means
as
the
proper
division
of
duties
between
congress
and
the
courts.
i
don't
think
that's
what
cannon
says.
i
don't
think
that's
what
touche
ross
says.
touche
ross
distinguishes
itself,
as
pointed
out
in
the
notes,
and
this
is
a
classic
and
ordinary
record
keeping
and
document
filing
statute,
and
informational
statute.
it
doesn't
purport
to
create
any
right
of
a
vis-à-vis
b,
requires
it
--
it
purports
to
create
to
be
read
as
creating
and
was
read
by
the
majority
as
creating
nothing
more
than
a
right
of
the
government
to
require
a
to
do
something.
now
whether
one
would
have
liked
to
see
that
swept
up
in
a
broader
implication
or
not,
i
think
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
section
206.
i'm
merely
suggesting,
justice
rehnquist,
in
response
to
the
question
is
the
world
changing
a
year
after
require
precise
codification
by
the
congress
of
every
substantive
right
and
duty
that
it
thinks
ought
to
exist
within
the
system
of
jurisprudence,
that
this
may
raise
more
dangers
than
it
cures.
i
don't
deny
that
at
some
levels
and
at
some
limits
that
is
a
difficult
question.
i
suggest,
respectfully,
that
with
regard
to
a
simple
section
like
206,
it
isn't.
i
thank
the
court.
