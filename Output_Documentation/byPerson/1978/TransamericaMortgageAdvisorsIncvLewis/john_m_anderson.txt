mr.
john
m.
anderson
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
now
before
the
court
transamerica
mortgage
advisors
versus
lewis
presents
a
narrow
technical
question
of
law
and
a
broad
important
question
of
judicial
policy.
the
question
of
law
presented
is
whether
section
206
of
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940
affords
of
private
right
of
action.
the
question
of
judicial
policy
presented
is
whether
this
court
should
imply
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
advisers
act
and
then
leave
to
further
litigation
resolution
of
such
questions
as
who
may
bring
the
action,
who
may
be
the
defendant,
who
may
be
sued
for
what
breaches
of
what
duties
as
well
questions
of
reliance,
causation
and
intent.
this
court
is
being
asked
to
interpret
the
statute
but
i
submit
that
it
is
being
asked
in
a
larger
sense
to
assess
its
law
in
the
application
of
federal
securities
laws.
this
court
is
not
being
asked
to
deny
relief
to
those
clients
of
investment
advisers
who
have
been
victims
of
the
advisers
deceit
or
negligence.
ample
federal
and
state
remedies
already
exist
for
the
redress
of
the
grievances
by
clients
of
investment
advisers.
this
court
is
not
being
asked
to
read
the
investment
act
narrowly
or
restrictively
in
violation
of
the
principal
announced
in
the
borak
case.
we
do
simply
urge
that
this
act
be
read
at
it
was
written
by
the
congress
and
as
it
has
been
amended.
the
facts
of
this
case
briefly
are
as
follows.
the
case
came
to
court
in
april
1973
with
the
suit
by
the
plaintiff
and
respondent,
harry
lewis,
asking
legal
and
equitable
relief
for
alleged
violations
of
the
investment
advisers
act.
the
lawsuit
was
cast
as
both
a
derivative
action
on
behalf
of
mortgage
trust
of
america,
a
real
estate
investment
trust
and
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
the
shareholders
of
mortgage
trust
of
america.
the
petitioners
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
and
argued
that
since
mortgage
trust
of
america
wasn't
is
a
mortgage
lender
which
does
not
deal
in
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
securities
law.
it
was
not
subject
to
the
investment
advisers
act
at
1940
that
further,
since
transamerica
mortgage
advisors
is
not
a
public
investment
adviser
in
any
sense
of
those
words,
it's
not
subject
to
the
act.
we
further
argued
that
the
respondent
had
failed
to
make
proper
demand
on
the
trustees
of
mortgage
trust
of
america
and
finally,
we
argued
that
the
advisers
act
does
not
afford
a
private
right
of
action
in
any
of
that.
the
district
court
noted
the
petitioner's
arguments
or
had
what
we're
called
the
substantial
merit
but
ruled
that
since
the
advisers
act
does
not
afford
a
private
right
of
action,
there
was
no
need
to
decide
the
other
arguments
advanced.
on
appeal,
petitioners
again
argued
that
the
investment
advisers
act
does
not
apply
to
the
petitioners
or
the
facts
in
this
case
and
that
there
is
no
private
right
of
action
in
any
event.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
private
right
of
action.
the
question
is
recently
post
in
the
petition
for
cert
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
impairing
the
brief,
we
know
the
question
to
whether
private
right
of
action
for
money
damages.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that
is
correct.
the
reason
for
the
narrowing
of
the
question
which
i
believe
to
be
proper
within
the
meaning
of
the
court's
rules
was
that
the
court
of
appeal
decision
which
is
in
question
here
from
the
ninth
circuit
was
based
on
and
simply
incorporated
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
called
abrahamson
versus
fleschner,
and
that
case
was
devoted
exclusively
to
the
consideration
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
for
damages.
equitable
issues
were
not
present
in
that
case
or
equitable
claims
are
not
present.
and
for
that
reason,
we
know
that
also
because
much
of
the
claim
for
equitable
relief
in
this
case
seemed
to
be
moot
and
for
that
reason
we
deemed
that
to
be
the
issue.
nonetheless,
we,
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
incurred
the
raft
of
our
opponents
in
their
brief
and
for
that
reason
in
our
reply
brief,
we
adjust
the
problem
across
the
board
broadly
both
equitable
and
legal
relief.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that's
the
question
that's
before
the
court.
returning
to
the
chronology
of
events
that
bring
us
here
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
no,
we
do
not
come
out
differently
on
equal
--
the
equity
or
legal
questions,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that
is
correct
and
we
did
for
the
reason
explained
to
mr.
stewart
because
of
the
incorporation
of
the
decision
in
the
abrahamson
case.
but
to
be
clear
and
to
emphasize
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
there
is
a
right
to
legal
or
equitable
relief
by
implication
under
the
advisers
act.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
i'm
not
sure
to
what
extent
they
are
connected
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
court
couldn't
theoretically
at
least
make
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
money
damages
and
the
right
to
equitable
relief
in
the
case.
but
i
will
agree
with
our
opponents
that
that
would
be
an
anomalous
result
and
i
think
would
lead
to
more
difficulties
than
it
would
solve.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
it
may
suggest
that
but
i
think
the
reading
of
the
act
as
a
whole
suggest
that
in
particularly
the
language
which
follows
the
expression
suits
an
equity
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggest
that
that
is
because
the
act
as
a
whole
is
due
to
enforcement
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
and
that
commission
as
being
given
broad
power
to
seek
injunctive
relief
and
i
think
that's
the
reason
for
that
particular
provision
on
the
act,
a
point
which
i
will
stress
later
in
this
argument.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes,
i
think
that
is
probably
the
case.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
limitation
of
the
language
to
suits
and
equity
suggests
that
the
congress
meant
to
imply
a
right
to
equitable
relief,
i
think
quite
the
opposite.
i
think
that
the
--
as
suggested
by
some
of
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes,
the
equitable
issue
is
before
the
court.
it
is
a
prayer
or
an
aspect
of
the
prayer
in
the
complaint
which
was
filed
in
this
case
and
this
counsel
for
the
respondent
correctly
point
out
it
is
an
aspect
of
the
prayer
which
of
the
relief
which
they
sought
and
so
i
think
it's
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
since
that
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
there's
an
implied
right
of
action
in
composing
both
legal
and
equitable
relief,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
i
think
that
the
answer
is
before
that
it
has
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
reason
for
that
again
was
because
in
the
decision
which
was
subject
to
appeal
here
namely
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
simply
incorporated
a
second
circuit
decision
in
the
same
called
abrahamson
versus
fleschner.
and
in
that
particular
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
my
view
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
i
don't
want
to
be
presumptuous
to
suggest
what
the
court
has
to
do.
it's
my
view
that
the
question
of
both
legal
and
equitable
relief
is
before
the
court.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
there's
not
such
compulsion.
however,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
to
the
extent
that
we
are
seeking
to
solve
problems
here
that
it
might
be
helpful
to
litigants
at
large
if
there
was
some
indication
of
the
court's
views
on
the
subject
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case.
i
think
for
example
here
that
the
problem
that
could
be
--
that
might
be
pointed
put
by
that
kind
of
distinction
is
illustrated
by
this
very
case
in
which
the
respondent
seeks
recisionary
rights
and
incidental
damages.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
sort
of
runs
together
the
issue
to
such
an
extent
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
be
tried
to
separate
them
out.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
the
equitable
relief
entails
in
the
first
sentence
a
prayer
that
an
advisory
contract
be
enjoined
from
renewal
or
enforcement.
it
has
in
fact
been
renewed
since
the
beginning
of
his
litigation
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
--
and
so
and
there's
been
no
effort
to
seek
preliminary
or
interim
relief
by
the
respondent
so
i
take
that
it
has
--
it's
moot
to
that
extent.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that
is
correct.
and
it
is
also
true
that
in
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
the
court
talks
of
both
legal
and
equitable
relief
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
simply
incorporating
the
decision
or
ruling
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
abrahamson
case.
in
the
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit,
we
argued
again
that
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
lend
themselves
to
application
of
the
advisers
act
in
any
event
and
that
there
was
no
private
right
of
action.
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
decide
the
other
issues
advanced
and
with
one
judge
dissenting
ruled
that
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
for
injunctive
relief
and
damages
under
the
advisers
act
in
favor
of
appropriate
plaintiffs
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
goals
of
congress
in
enacting
the
legislation.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
i
indicated
simply
adopts
wholesale.
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
both
the
majority
opinion
and
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
case
of
abrahamson
versus
fleschner.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
resolution
of
this
case
entails
first,
consideration
of
the
special
wording
of
the
advisers
act.
and
i
want
to
stress
that
the
advisers
act
is
unique
among
all
the
federal
securities
acts
in
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
not
simply
in
limiting
to
the
question
of
actions
at
--
or
the
elimination
of
expression
actions
of
law
but
in
the
phrase
which
follows
that.
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
this
because
it
has
not
been
a
matter
of
extended
treatments
on
the
brief.
but
in
the
advisers
act,
the
jurisdictions
conferred
“of
all
suits
and
equity
to
enjoin
any
violation
of
the
act.”
it
does
not
confer
jurisdiction
over
actions
of
law
or
actions
other
than
suits
and
equity
to
enjoin
all
of
the
other
federal
securities
laws.
the
33
act,
the
34
act
and
the
other
security
action
question
also
refer
to
jurisdiction
of
all
suits
and
equity
and
actions
at
law
brought
to
enforce
any
liability
or
duty
created.
there
is
a
significant
and
i
believe
to
be
important
distinction
in
the
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
which
is
conferred
between
the
1940
act
and
the
1933
and
the
1934
act
in
particular.
the
second
matter
which
i
believe
must
be
resolved
here
is
the
consideration
of
the
factors
that
pointed
out
in
this
of
course
1975
opinion,
the
case
of
cort
versus
ash
in
which
the
court
specified
or
suggested
factors
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
act
not
expressly
providing
the
private
right
of
action
would
nonetheless
afford
implication.
in
doing
that
kind
of
analysis
which
i
do
not
intend
to
date
to
belabor
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
important
aspect
to
that
is
attention
to
the
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history
of
the
investment
advisers
act
belies
any
suggestion
that
congress
thought
initially
or
has
thought
since
that
it
ought
it
to
be
the
basis
for
private
right
of
action.
and
finally,
i
would
submit
that
the
court
ought
to
consider
the
results
it
would
follow
if
this
court
were
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
advisers
act.
the
original
legislation
in
1940
began
with
an
fcc
bill
which
contains
standard
jurisdictional
language
which
included
reference
to
jurisdiction
over
suits
and
equity
and
actions
at
law.
the
same
language
that
was
in
the
1933
and
the
1934
act.
following
negotiation
and
hearing,
a
compromise
was
reached
and
arranged
on
various
aspects
of
the
bill.
and
one
of
the
changes
made
was
that
the
language
actions
at
law
with
respect
to
duties
and
violations
of
the
act
was
eliminated
and
we
are
now
have
the
statute
which
is
before
us
which
refers
only
to
suits
and
equity
to
enjoined
any
violation
of
the
act.
secondly,
and
there's
another
important
distinction.
from
it's
inception
in
1940,
the
investment
advisers
act
has
never
had
any
provision
for
express
civil
liability.
unlike
that
1993
act
and
unlike
the
1934
act,
the
investment
advisers
act
does
not
provide
any
express
liability
in
any
of
its
provisions.
in
1960,
the
advisers
act
was
amended
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
was
given
additional
enforcement
powers.
but
the
grant
and
jurisdiction
or
the
limitation
of
jurisdiction
if
you
will
was
not
changed,
it
remained
the
same.
and
in
1970,
there
was
i
believe
to
be
the
most
important
and
direct
announcement
by
the
congress
as
to
the
meaning
or
intention
with
respect
to
the
advisers
act
when
the
congress
added
a
private
right
of
action
to
the
companion
statute,
that's
the
investment
company
act
at
1940.
and
they
added
an
express
private
right
of
action
to
that
legislation
and
further
specified
in
adding
that
express
right
of
action
who
may
be
the
plaintiff,
who
may
be
the
defendant.
the
nature
of
the
duty
that
would
be
violated
giving
rights
to
the
action,
they
allocated
the
burden
of
proof,
they
establish
evidentiary
standards
and
finally
they
prescribe
the
damages
which
may
be
recovered.
this
was
all
done
in
1970
at
the
time
amendments
were
being
made
to
both
the
investment
company
act
and
the
investment
advisers
act.
no
creation
of
express
civil
liability,
no
creation
of
an
express
private
right
of
action
was
had
under
the
advisers
act
even
though
it
was
done
very
specifically
and
deliberately
under
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
it
was
proposed
by
the
fcc
at
various
times
and
including
in
1970
but
there
was
no
action
taken
on
it
and
as
my
colleague,
the
attorneys
for
the
respondent
remind
us
we're
not
to
make
much
of
silence,
i
gather.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
has
been
proposed
and
was
most
recently
proposed
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1976
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
there's
been
no
action
taken
on.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
if
i
may
to
the
results
that
would
follow
if
this
court
were
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action.
because
of
the
special
wording
of
the
investors
advisers
act,
it
would
create
at
a
minimum
a
hornet's
nest
of
litigation
because
it
cannot
help
it
but
create
a
series
of
unanswered
questions.
the
investment
advisers
act
section
206,
the
basis
for
the
claim
of
an
implied
right
of
action
in
this
case
refers
to
wrongdoing
against
clients
of
investment
advisers
or
prospective
clients.
the
keywords
of
course
are
prospective
clients.
and
the
first
question
it
must
come
to
mind
is
what
is
meant
by
prospective
clients?
i
submit
that
the
use
of
that
phrase
is
consistent
with
conferral
of
authority
and
jurisdiction
on
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
seek
relief
against
investment
advisers
who
are
soliciting
business
going
after
business.
it
is,
i
think
equally
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
it
could
be
from
that
could
be
implied
a
right
of
private
right
of
action.
the
first
question
being
of
course,
who
are
prospective
clients
of
investment
advisers?
mr.
john
m.
anderson
it
might
--
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
may
suggest
equitable
relief
only
but
i
think
it
raises
the
problem
which
this
court
addressed
in
the
blue
chip
stamp
case
namely,
who
are
this
class
of
people
who
might
be
clients
of
the
investment
advisers.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
use
of
prospective
clients
belies
any
suggestion
that
was
intended
that
this
act
confer
jurisdiction
on
people
who
could
claim
that
they
might
have
been
an
adviser
a
client
of
the
investment
adviser
if
they
but
known
what
good
advice
or
what
bad
advice
he
was
going
to
give.
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
it
simply
creates
an
open-ended
class
of
plaintiffs
without
limits
as
judge
gurfein
suggested
in
his
dissent
in
the
abrahamson
case.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes.
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
most
obvious
limit
would
come
to
mind
would
be
that
in
the
event,
a
client
of
an
investment
adviser
purchase
a
stock
and
in
connection
with
that
purchase,
the
investment
adviser
had
acted
intentionally
deceitful
with
respect
to
representations
about
the
stock.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
client
would
have
a
claim
under
rule
10
(b)
or
a
rule
10
(b)
(5)
under
the
1934
act.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
well,
the
question
of
course
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
they
would
have
if
they
imply
a
private
right
of
action.
i'm
suggesting
that
there
is
a
remedy.
there
is
a
remedy
available
at
present
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that's
--
that's
correct
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that's
right.
and
it
is
significant
mr.
justice
stevens
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
allegation
of
a
purchase
or
sale.
we're
dealing
instead
with
a
fact
situation
which
has
been
characterized
at
the
conclusion
of
the
complaint
as
being
by
its
nature
fraudulent,
deceitful
or
in
violation
of
the
act.
the
second
result
of
implying
a
private
right
of
action
here
is
to
leave
open
the
question
of
prospective
defendants
section
206
speaks
of
those
who
aid
or
bet
in
the
familiar
language.
and
therefore,
i
submit
that
the
question
not
only
is
open
as
to
who
may
sue
but
who
may
be
a
defendant.
at
least
open
also
the
question
of
reliance
and
causation
and
at
least
open
the
question
of
intent
which
this
court
dealt
with
in
the
hochfelder
case.
now,
the
potential
reach
of
a
private
action
under
the
advisers
act
is
illustrated
by
this
very
case.
it
is
alleged
here
that
the
advisor
to
a
real
estate
investment
trust
has
violated
the
advisers
act.
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
wrongdoing
occurred
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
or
any
securities.
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
acts
of
trustee
petitioner
constituted
willful
deception.
there
is
no
allegation
here
of
intentional
concealment
of
any
material
facts.
the
complaint
simply
constitutes
a
description
of
facts,
facts
which
were
revealed
and
in
fact
reported
to
the
fcc
in
registration
statements
and
then
characterized
as
being
in
violation
of
the
act
under
section
206.
i
would
submit
that
in
the
consideration
of
whether
or
not
the
language
land
itself
to
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action.
the
court
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
if
a
private
right
of
action
were
to
be
implied
in
this
case,
it
would
open
the
door
to
the
avoidance
of
the
limitations
on
private
security
actions
which
has
been
recognized
by
this
court.
limitations
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
purchase
or
sale.
a
limitation
recognized
in
the
blue
chip
stamp
case.
it
would
permit
disregard
of
the
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
alleged
and
proved
intent
to
defraud
and
deceive.
a
limitation
recognized
in
the
hochfelder
case.
it
would
permit
disregard
of
the
requirement
that
there
be
willful
deception
not
just
reach
of
fiduciary
duty.
a
limitation
recognized
in
the
santa
fe,
industries
versus
green
case.
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
be
as
brief
as
i
can.
the
omission
of
the
phrase
action
at
law
in
and
of
itself
is
not
as
significant
as
the
omission
of
the
phrase
action
at
law
brought
to
enforce
in
the
liability
or
duty
created.
those
words
do
not
appear
in
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940.
they
do
appear
in
the
1933
act
and
in
the
1934
act.
i
think
that
is
the
omission
which
is
significant.
there
are
a
limited
number
of
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes,
that's
correct.
i
was
not
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes
that
is
correct.
however,
in
the
33
and
34
act
where
there
are
creations
of
express
rights
of
action.
those
provisions
providing
those
express
rights
of
action
create
and
have
in
them
those
very
sections
conferral
of
jurisdiction
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
significance
is
not
the
omission
of
the
inclusion
for
that
purpose
but
to
suggest
a
broader
range
of
remedies
available.
there
are
a
few
numbers
of
suits
against
real
estate
investment
trust
because
of
the
uncertainty
as
to
whether
or
not
a
private
right
of
action
exists
under
this
act.
that
i
think
is
the
answer
to
the
fact
that
they
are
only
some
15
suits
that
we've
been
able
to
find
in
recent
years.
as
the
court
may
know
the
district
courts
have
been
divided
on
this
issue
and
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
conceded
this,
there
has
been
a
strong
dissent.
with
respect
to
judge
gurfein's
comment
that
there
might
be
equitable
relief
available,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
equitable
relief
has
an
issue
was
not
in
that
case
but
more
importantly,
i
think
it
would
be
anomalous
for
this
court
to
conclude
that
there
might
be
equitable
relief
because
the
existence
of
equitable
relief
presupposes,
under
standard
equitable
principles
the
existence
or
the
absence
of
adequate
legal
relief
and
i
think
it
would
be
on
that
technical
legal
ground,
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
do
so
but
more
importantly
as
we
point
out
in
this
case
since
there
is
a
prayer
here
for
rescission,
the
line
between
equitable
relief
and
money
damage
relief
is
bound
to
be
blurred.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
refers
to
the
only
other
case
in
which
this
court
has
considered
the
investment
advisers
act
namely
the
capital
gains
case.
in
the
capital
gains
case,
this
court
held
that
the
commission
need
not
show
intentional
rueful
misconduct
the
old
fashioned
fraud
in
order
to
obtain
an
injunction.
are
we
to
understand
from
that
that
a
private
litigant
seeking
injunctive
relief
also
would
not
have
to
sell
old
fashioned
fraud,
intentional
conduct
and
if
that
is
the
case,
does
it
not
undermine
this
court's
ruling
in
the
hochfelder
case
where
the
limitation
on
the
kind
of
conduct
that
could
be
proscribed.
the
argument
is
made
in
this
case
that
the
advisers
act
at
least
provides
for
equitable
relief
that
is
based
on
section
215
(b)
of
the
advisers
act
and
as
we
submit
and
discuss
at
length
in
the
red
reply
brief
that
argument
is
base
on
misreadings
of
that
section
and
does
not
account
for
the
fact
that
that
section
was
undoubtedly
based
on
state
law
in
which
the
voidability
provision
was
available
as
a
defense
for
someone
seeking
to
enforce
an
adviser
contract
did
not
confer
necessarily
or
by
experience
a
right
to
affirmative
action.
the
advisers
act,
unlike
the
1933
and
1934
act
does
not
purport
to
regulate
the
marketing
of
securities
generally.
it
is
aimed
to
the
small
specific
segment
of
the
securities
industry.
it
is
aimed
instead
at
its
special
relationship
rather
than
arrange
of
transactions
and
we
submit
that
that
he
used
1933
and
1934
act
principles
in
wholesale
interpretation
of
the
advisers
act
simply
because
they
are
both
of
three,
are
all
three
are
federal
securities
law
is
misleading
and
inappropriate
given
their
different
aims
and
different
purposes.
accepting
the
premise
that
the
advisers
act
was
intended
to
protect
clients
of
investment
advisers,
it
is
ironic
i
think,
that
if
this
court
were
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
under
that
act,
it
would
plunge
those
litigants,
those
claimants,
those
clients
of
investment
advisers
into
years
of
unknown
litigation.
and
i
say
unknown
as
to
who
may
bring
the
suit,
who
may
be
a
defendant,
who
may
be
sued,
what
are
the
standards
for
causation,
and
what
are
the
questions
for
intent.
how
much
more
it
would
benefit
the
investors
--
how
much
more
would
benefit
the
clients
of
investment
advisers
if
the
federal
court
which
will
leave
to
congress
the
task
of
weighing
and
considering
those
very
questions
as
the
congress
itself
did
in
1970
and
its
evaluation
of
the
investment
company
act.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
beneficiaries
of
the
act,
namely
the
clients
of
investment
advisers
would
benefit
more
from
refusing
to
imply
a
right
--
a
private
right
of
action
here
and
allowing
the
congress
to
weigh
and
to
evaluate
the
remedies
before
opening
the
door
to
witless,
protracted,
private
litigation
in
the
federal
courts.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
six
months
since
this
court
first
heard
oral
argument
in
this
case.
and
for
that
reason,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
take
a
minute
or
two
to
offer
a
brief
summary
of
the
facts
relevant
to
the
issue
again
before
this
court,
namely,
whether
a
private
right
of
action
may
be
implied
under
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940.
this
court
learned
last
march
this
case
came
to
court
in
april
1973
with
a
suit
by
the
plaintiff
and
respondent
harry
lewis
asking
legal
and
equitable
relief
for
alleged
violation
of
the
investment
advisers
act.
the
petitioners
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
and
argued
that
mortgage
trust
of
america
was
and
is
a
mortgage
lender
which
does
not
deal
in
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
that
transamerica
mortgage
advisors,
its
--
its
adviser
is
not
a
public
investment
adviser
in
any
sense
of
that
word.
that
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940
does
not
apply
to
the
petitioners
or
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
that
the
respondent
lewis
had
failed
to
make
proper
demand
on
the
trustees
of
mortgage
trust
of
america
and
that
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940
does
not
afford
a
private
right
of
action
in
any
event.
the
district
court
noted
that
the
petitioners'
arguments
had
what
were
called
"substantial
merit"
but
ruled
that
since
the
advisers
act
does
not
afford
a
private
right
of
action
that
the
other
questions
would
not
be
decided.
on
appeal,
petitioners
again
argued
that
the
investment
advisers
act
does
not
apply
to
the
petitioners
or
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
that
there
is
no
private
right
of
action.
the
court
of
appeals
also
declined
to
consider
the
other
arguments
just
mentioned
and
ruled,
with
one
judge
dissenting,
"implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
for
injunctive
relief
and
damages
under
the
advisers
act
in
favor
of
appropriate
plaintiffs
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
goals
of
congress
in
enacting
legislation."
the
decision
and
the
dissent
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
based
on
and
indeed
simply
incorporates
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
and
the
dissent
in
the
second
circuit
in
a
case
known
as
abrahamson
versus
fleschner.
as
we
had
occasioned
to
state
last
march,
this
case
presents
a
narrow
technical
question
of
law
and
a
broad
important
question
of
judicial
policy.
the
narrow
question
of
law
presented
is
whether
a
private
right
of
action
may
be
implied
under
section
206
of
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940.
the
question
of
judicial
policy
presented
is
whether
this
court
should
imply
a
right
of
action
under
the
advisers
act
and
then
leave
to
further
litigation
resolution
of
such
questions
as
who
may
bring
the
action,
who
may
be
named
a
defendant,
allocations
of
burdens
of
proof,
the
evidentiary
standards
to
be
applied,
and
the
damages
which
may
be
recovered.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
it's
my
belief
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
--
that
congress
has
had
an
opportunity
on
numerous
occasions
both
when
the
act
was
originally
passed
and
since
that
time
to
consider
and
to
act
on
whether
or
not
a
private
right
of
action
is
appropriate
here.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
on
each
occasion
it
has
not
created,
expressly
not
created
and
imply
--
excuse
me
--
a
cause
of
action
and
for
that
reason,
we
take
the
position
that
this
court
is
not
in
a
position
to
--
to
make
that
judgment,
if
you
will,
that
there
ought
to
be
a
private
right
of
action.
i
might
--
in
further
answer
to
that
question,
refer
back
to
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
made
the
judgment
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
this
implied
right
of
action
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.
and
i
question
it,
with
all
due
respect,
whether
this
court
is
in
a
position
to
substitute
its
judgment
or
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
a
position
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
what
seems
to
be
the
judgment
of
the
congress
on
six
different
occasions
since
1940
that
there
should
not
be
an
expressed
or
a
right
of
private
action
under
the
investment
advisers
act.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes.
professor
loss
suggested
in
his
testimony
to
the
--
to
the
committee
hearing
of
legislation
that
was
proposed,
i
believe
in
1966
that
it
might
facilitate,
i
think
those
were
his
words,
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
if
this
court
--
if
the
congress
at
that
time
were
to
add
the
words
"action
at
law"
to
the
jurisdiction
and
venue
provision
of
the
statute.
but
i
think
that
the
suggestion
that
facilitation
would
take
place
is
a
telling
--
admission
that
it
does
not
exist
otherwise.
now,
for
this
court
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
investment
advisers
act,
it
would
necessarily
engender
uncertainty
as
well
as
cause
delay
and
undoubtedly
add
to
the
expense
of
the
parties
involved
and
in
general
frustrate
the
very
rights
which
is
suggested
here
should
be
implied.
and
i
say
that
because
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
must
necessarily
in
the
context
of
this
case
leave
open
all
of
those
questions
which
congress
very
well
could
spell
out,
could
delineate,
could
define
as
it
did
when
it
created
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
investment
company
act
in
1970.
this
engendering
of
uncertainty
comes
against
a
background
of
statutory
language
which
is
unique
to
the
investment
adviser
act
and
which
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
for
only
one
legal
purpose,
the
jurisdictional
provision
of
the
investment
advisers
act
limits
the
jurisdiction
to
a
suit
in
equity
to
enjoin
violations
of
the
act.
that
language
is
unique
to
the
investment
advisers
act
and
it
is
distinguishable
from
each
of
the
other
federal
securities
laws.
the
other
laws
--
the
other
acts
all
provide
that
the
jurisdiction
shall
extend
to
all
suits
in
equity
and
actions
at
law
brought
to
enforce
any
liability
or
duty
created
under
each
of
those
acts.
the
addition
of
--
or
the
omission
of
the
language
action
at
law
brought
to
enforce
any
duty
or
liability,
we
are
told
in
the
case
of
touche
ross
versus
redington
ought
not
to
be
read
as
the
creation
of
a
private
right
of
action
but
we
contend
that
it
remains
an
important
indication
of
congressional
intent.
now
the
respondent's
only
explanation
for
the
difference
in
the
language
between
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940
and
the
other
federal
securities
laws,
to
which
i
have
just
referred,
is
that
there
was
either
an
unintentional
oversight
by
an
unidentified
draftsman
and
that
the
section
itself
really
has
no
legislative
history
worthy
of
the
name.
now,
the
importance
of
the
advisers
act's
special
language
is
reinforced
by
an
examination
of
that
act's
legislative
history.
now,
a
physical
anthropologist,
the
counsel
in
this
case
have
sifted
through
the
legislative
history,
the
stand
--
the
sands
and
the
pebbles,
if
you
will,
of
legislative
history,
and
they
have
found
artifacts
to
support
their
position
in
each
direction.
but
the
important
part
of
that
--
of
that
search
or
to
--
to
take
the
metaphor
one
step
further,
that
dig
is
that
--
that
the
proponents
of
an
affirmative
private
right
of
actions
for
damages
in
this
case
or
for
equitable
relief
have
been
unable
to
point
to
any
one
solid
evidence
or
one
solid
piece
of
testimony
or
anything
that
would
approach
solid
indication
that
congress
intended
that
the
act
serve
as
a
spring-board
for
private
actions
by
disgruntled
investors.
but
there
is
one
other
artifact
on
the
other
side
that
we
believe
to
be
particularly
important,
and
that
is
the
amendment
to
the
investment
company
act
in
1970
in
which
the
congress
expressly
created
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
investment
company
act,
the
companion
statute
to
the
investment
advisers
act.
the
1970
amendment
to
the
investment
company
act
added
a
private
right
of
action
to
the
investment
company
act,
but
no
private
right
of
action
to
the
advisers
act.
this
addition
of
a
private
right
of
action
to
the
investment
company
act
included
congressional
attention
to
each
of
those
unknown
factors
to
which
i
referred
earlier.
when
congress
acted
in
1970,
it
defined
the
duty
or
the
standard
of
conduct,
it
defined
the
class
of
plaintiffs,
parties
who
could
sue.
it
defined
the
class
of
defendants
who
could
be
sued.
it
allocated
the
burden
of
proof.
it
established
the
evidentiary
standards
that
must
be
met
by
the
plaintiff.
and
it
proscribed
the
damages
which
could
be
recoverable.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
however,
as
recently
as
--
as
june,
i
believe
it
was,
in
the
case
of
touche
ross
versus
redington,
this
court
ruled
that
--
and
instructed,
if
you
will,
counsel
to
look
to
the
context
in
which
a
statute
was
enacted
or
to
look
to
the
context
in
which
it
appears.
the
exact
words
are
the
--
to
call
attention
to
the
statutory
scheme
of
which
the
statute
was
a
part.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes.
and
in
1940,
of
course,
there
was
no
private
right
of
action
created
under
the
investment
company
act
either.
but
i
think
it
significant
that
in
1970,
in
the
course
of
amending
both
the
investment
advisers
act
and
the
investment
company
act
that
the
congress
expressly
created
a
private
right
of
action
against
certain
investment
advisers
under
the
investment
company
act.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
--
if
congress
had
intended
that
there
be
or
wanted
there
to
be,
if
you
will,
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
investment
advisers
act,
that
would
have
been
the
time
to
do
it.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
it's
possible,
mr.
--
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
possible
that
congress
could
have
assumed
that.
however,
for
congress
to
have
assumed
that,
one
would
have
supposed
that
we
could
find
in
the
record
some
indication
or
existence
of
that
assumption
and
there
is
none.
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest,
nothing
in
the
congressional
hearing
to
suggest
that
congress
assumed
that
that
right
existed.
and
i
would
further
add
that
if
congress
assumed
that
the
right
existed,
why
did
it
deem
it
necessary
to
create
the
act,
the
private
right
of
action
into
the
investment
company
act,
in
which
a
companion
statute
in
which
it
could've
just
as
easily
have
deemed
that
it
existed
and
therefore
was
unnecessary
in
that
instance.
it
--
to
take
it
one
step
further,
the
actions
of
congress
in
1970
really
alleviate
the
major
policy
objections
that
we
see
to
the
implication
of
a
private
right
in
this
instance
because
as
i
point
out,
it
does
really
address
all
of
these
very
difficult
questions
having
to
do
with
standing
damages,
burdens
of
proof,
and
so
forth.
now
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
investment
advisers
act.
the
--
you're
quite
correct
that
in
the
first
argument
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
a
distinction
should
be
made.
we
urged
then
and
we
urge
now
that
no
such
distinction
should
be
made.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes.
in
a
footnote,
in
a
dicta
footnote
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
--
judge
gurfein
suggested
it
might
be
easier
to
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
however,
we
give
it
due
homage
because
it
was
a
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
--
in
support
of
our
position.
the
--
justice
gurfein's
dissent
in
a
--
suggests
that
it
might
be
easier
given
the
language
of
the
advisers
act
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
for
an
equitable
action
to
enjoin.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
but
we
take
the
position
that
the
rationale
which
would
dictate
a
decision
with
respect
to
money
damages
applies
with
equal
force
in
this
instance
to
the
right
to
equitable
relief.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
is
correct.
it
was
simply
adopted
the
opinion
of
mr.
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes,
it
is
an
action
for
money
damages
and
for
equitable
relief.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
right.
and
if
i
may
add
to
that,
the
difficulty
which
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
last
march
in
which
--
that
will
of
course
persist
today
is
that
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
asked
for
rescission
and
incidental
damages.
so
if
for
example
this
court
were
to
make
a
distinction
between
legal
and
equitable
relief
and
to
limit
it,
the
relief
to
equitable
relief,
i
think
that
the
distinction
would
soon
become
the
--
become
meaningless
for
the
reason
that
courts
of
equity
have
traditionally
been
empowered
to
grant
complete
relief
including
incidental
damages
as
necessary.
now
there
is
additional
legislative
history
which
clearly
points
away
in
our
judgment
from
the
implication
of
a
private
remedy
here.
but
rather
than
repeat
and
summarize
that
history
all
of
which
appears
in
the
briefs,
i
respectfully
refer
simply
to
the
fact
again
that
neither
the
respondent
nor
the
sec
have
been
able
to
offer
any
direct
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
give
clients
of
investment
advisers
ready
access
to
the
federal
courts.
at
best
the
respondents
and
the
sec
simply
urge
an
analogy
to
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
a
different
act
for
a
different
purpose.
let
me
turn
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
two
principal
policy
objections
to
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
advisers
act.
first,
if
this
court
were
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
advisers
act,
it
would
undermine,
if
not
destroy,
this
court's
recognition
in
1975
that
an
investor
cannot
maintain
an
action
under
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
unless
the
investor
can
allege
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
now,
according
to
the
respondents
and
the
sec,
merely
being
a
client
of
an
investment
adviser,
the
existence
of
the
relationship
endows
that
client
or
prospective
client
with
the
right
to
sue
for
damages
or
to
seek
equitable
relief
even
though
the
client
or
prospective
client
neither
purchased
nor
sold
a
security.
let
me
pose
an
example.
let
us
suppose
that
an
investment
adviser
recommended
against
the
purchase
of
a
certain
common
stock.
let
us
further
suppose
that
the
client
follows
the
advice
of
the
adviser
and
does
not
purchase
the
stock.
let
us
suppose
that
the
stock
next
rises
in
value.
according
to
the
sec
and
the
respondent,
the
existence
of
the
relationship
between
the
adviser
and
the
client
would
give
that
client
the
right
to
file
a
suit
against
the
adviser
and
allege
that
but
for
the
advice
he
would
have
purchased
the
common
stock.
now,
the
sec
clearly
says
at
pages
40
to
45
--
excuse
me
--
41
through
45
of
its
initial
brief,
that
since
the
investment
advisers
act
does
not
have
purchase
or
sale
language,
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
that.
it
is
not
a
requirement.
the
respondent
seems
to
say
the
same
thing
at
pages
60
to
62
of
its
--
of
the
respondent's
brief,
although
it
is
less
direct.
the
conclusion
is
that
a
client
who
does
not
purchase
stock
would
be
entitled
to
maintain
an
action
under
section
206
of
the
advisers
act,
whereas
someone
who
did
not
have
an
investment
adviser,
and
was
not
dealing
with
an
investment
adviser,
would
be
barred
from
bringing
a
claim.
the
result
is
that
--
in
effect,
a
discrimination
between
those
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
afford
the
services
of
an
investment
adviser
and
those
who
do
not
use
an
investment
adviser.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
absolutely.
that's
correct.
but
the
point
--
the
point
is,
i
think,
mr.
stevens
--
mr.
justice
stevens
is
that
if
the
allegation
were
that
they
were
the
victim
of
fraud
with
respect
to
not
purchasing,
they
would
have
standing
under
the
rationale
of
the
interpretation
given
that
--
given
by
the
respondent
sec
--
by
the
respondent
and
the
sec
in
this
case.
i
think
the
example
well
illustrates
the
extent
to
which
implying
a
private
right
of
action
in
this
case
would
undermine
the
limitation,
if
you
will,
that
this
court
recognized
in
the
manor-blue
chip
stamp
case.
now
the
second
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
very
certainly,
mr.
justice
stevens
and
indeed
we
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes.
we
have
commented
upon
the
two
cases
which
seemed
to
be
most
directly
relevant
here
in
the
cannon
versus
the
university
of
chicago,
and
touche
ross
&
company
versus
redington,
both
of
which
seemed
to
bear
on
the
--
on
the
question
that's
currently
before
the
court.
and
we
have
commented
on
the
--
on
those
two
cases.
i
would
be
pleased
to
comment
here
on
the
--
the
impact
of
either
of
those
cases
if
--
if
you
wish.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
well,
i
--
i
do
indeed
think
that
both
cases
helps
us.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
the
yellow
--
there's
a
yellow
covered
brief,
i
believe,
and
it
includes
discussion
of
both
the
redington
case
and
the
touche
ross
case.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
and
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes.
and
i
believe
that
the
court
has
a
yellow
covered
brief
also
which
includes
a
--
it's
a
supplemental
brief
that
we
filed
which
is
devoted
in
a
large
part
to
both
the
cannon
and
to
the
touche
ross
case.
i
--
i
must
say
that
i
think
with
one
possible
exception
that
touche
ross
and
redington
seem
to
be
conceptually
identical
to
the
case
which
is
before
the
court
and
that
the
rationale
for
that
case
would
suggest
a
decision
in
the
petitioner's
favor
here.
the
case
of
--
of
cannon
is
not
inconsistent
with
a
ruling
here
for
the
rather,
i
think,
abundant
reasons
given
in
that
case,
such
as
the
existence
of
--
a
provision
for
attorney's
fees
to
the
prevailing
party
other
than
the
government,
the
existence
of
congressional
action
following
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
and
for
all
other
reasons
given
in
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
that
the
cannon
case
is
absolutely
consistent
with
a
ruling
in
the
petitioner's
favor
here.
let
me
now
return
if
i
--
if
it
please
the
court,
to
the
second
policy
consideration
which
bears
on
a
decision
here.
and
that
centers
on
the
special
wording
of
section
206,
the
provision
of
the
investment
advisers
act
on
which
the
claim
for
private
right
or
private
relief
is
based.
section
206
makes
it
unlawful
for
an
investment
adviser
to
defraud
a
client
or
prospective
client.
the
keywords
are
of
course
"a
prospective
client."
and
this
raises
an
interesting
example.
let
us
suppose
that
an
investment
adviser
were
to
send
a
business
solicitation
--
a
letter
or
material
to
a
prospective
client.
let
us
suppose
next
that
that
material
were
later
deemed
or
alleged
by
the
sec
to
be
misleading,
fraudulent,
deceptive,
and
so
forth.
the
sec
clearly
says
at
pages
40
--
41
through
45
of
its
brief
that
this
prospective
client
would
have
a
claim
under
the
investment
advisers
act
and
the
respondent
is
simply
silent
on
the
issue.
those
who
are
respect
--
prospective
clients
of
investment
advisers
are
hardly
a
discreet
class
of
plaintiffs.
but
more
importantly
the
--
the
notion
that
a
private
right
of
action
could
exist
in
favor
of
prospective
clients
at
a
minimum
raises
more
questions
than
it
could
possibly
answer.
nonetheless,
section
206
speaks
of
right
--
speaks
of
prospective
clients
as
well
as
clients.
prospective
clients,
however,
is
consistent
with
enforcement
by
the
sec,
going
into
court
and
seeking
to
prevent
an
investment
adviser
from
sending
misleading
or
deceptive
material
with
respect
to
investments.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
absolutely
not.
no
and
indeed
i
think
that
the
duty
and
responsibility
of
the
sec
is
the
--
is
the
enforcement
mechanism
under
this
act.
but
i've
simply
referred
to
sec's
enforcement
here
because
that
use
of
the
phrase
"prospective
client"
is
consistent
with
that
kind
of
enforcement,
and
i
submit
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
notion
of
private
enforcement.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
in
the
example
just
given,
under
the
express
wording
of
this
act,
they
could
go
into
court
and
seek
an
injunction
to
and
enjoin
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
only
equitable
relief.
that's
correct.
the
potential
reach
of
a
private
action
under
the
advisers
act
is
illustrated
by
this
very
case.
i
would
respectfully
remind
the
court
just
what
is
alleged
here.
it
is
alleged
here
that
the
adviser
to
a
real
estate
investment
trust
has
violated
the
advisers
act.
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
wrongdoing
occurred
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
securities.
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
acts
of
the
trustee
petitioners
constituted
willful
deception.
there
is
no
allegation
of
intentional
concealment
of
material
facts.
the
complaint
is
simply
a
complaint
about
a
relationship,
a
relationship
between
a
real
estate
investment
trust
and
its
adviser.
and
if
we
take
all
of
those
things
about
which
the
complaint
is
not
about,
i
think
it's
clear
to
see
the
fashion
or
the
manner
in
which
it
is
able
to
circumvent
the
limitations
of
this
court
in
recent
years
has
imposed
upon
securities
actions.
it
circumvents,
for
example,
the
--
the
requirement
in
ernst

now,

offer
a

of

reassurances
that
the
courts
of
appeals
will
be
appropriately
guided
by
recent
decisions
of
this
court
and
will
not

for
example,
in
response

the
contention
that

a
private
right
of
action
here
would
undermine
the
purchase

requirement,
the

at

of
its
brief,
"it
is
fair
to
presume
that
the
federal
courts
in
giving

will
be
appropriately

by
the
requirement

mr.
john
m.

no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
point
out
these
policy
difficulties
here
to,
if
you
will
to
explain
or
to
elaborate
the
--
the
resulting
difficulties
that
would
follow
from
an
implication
in
this
instance.
and
as
we
are
instructed,
this
court
is
a
court
to
consider
policy
and
so
for
that
reason,
i
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
but
i
want
to
repeat
in
direct
answer
to
your
question
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
the
--
the
question
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
we
learn
first
in
law
school
and
later
in
review
of
stern
&
gressman
is
to
be
--
to
consider
all
of
the
reasons
which
bear
on
a
decision.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decisions
that
--
for
example,
the
touche
--
excuse
me,
the
blue
chip
stamps
case,
those
policy
considerations
were
discussed
by
judge
gurfein
in
his
consent
in
the
abrahamson
case.
and
it
is
simply
here
that
i
repeat
them
to
point
out
the
practical
difficulties
that
follow
from
that
implication.
but
i
do
not
for
a
moment
wish
to
suggest
that
there
is
--
that
there
is
any
reason
here
why
this
court
would
want
to
do
anything
other
than
what
would
be
evident
from
the
intent
of
congress.
and
to
repeat
the
basic
point
here,
there
is
no
direct
evidence
here
of
which
we
are
aware
that
congress
intended
to
create
a
private
right
of
action.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
very
briefly.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
section
215
of
the
advisers
act,
the
so-called
void
provision
or
voidable
provision
is
discussed
at
pages
5
through
9
of
the
red
reply
brief.
and
i
will
not
take
any
time
here
but
the
--
in
essence,
the
argument
that
section
215
of
the
advisers
act
authorizes
private
actions
is
based
on
an
analogy
to
a
comparable
provision
under
the
1934
act,
an
act
which
has
a
statute
of
limitations
provision
in
it.
this
section
has
no
such
provision
in
it,
and
it
is
the
very
existence
of
that
statutory
statute
of
limitation
which
has
been
used
by
the
courts
to
justify
a
private
right
of
action
under
section
215.
this
act
is
not
the
1934
act.
it
had
a
different
purpose.
it
was
aimed
at
a
different
aspect
or
segment
of
the
securities
industry.
the
right
or
duty
language
which
appeared
in
--
in
both
touche
ross
and
in
the
--
in
the
cannon
case,
i
submit,
can
only
be
one
test.
it
ought
not
become
another
mechanistic
tool
whereby
you
look
and
you
find
the
existence
of
a
right
or
duty
and
then
automatically
turn
and
decide
that
there's
a
private
right
of
action.
i
hope
that
this
case
will
clarify
for
litigants
in
the
future
that
the
existence
of
a
right
or
duty
per
se
is
not
the
test.
the
basic
test
remains
the
intent
of
congress.
the
advisers
act,
unlike
the
1933
and
the
1934
act
does
not
purport
to
regulate
the
marketing
of
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
i
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
think
you
do
under
the
example
that
you
gave.
the
example
that
you
gave
was,
that
if
it
is
clear
enough
in
the
act
itself
that
congress
intended
to
create
--
act
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
yes.
but
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
there
are
any
number
of
federal
acts
which
create
rights
and
duty
languages
in
favor
of
special
classes
and
this
court
has
not
ruled
that
they
--
that
either
the
party
had
standing
to
do.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
because
i
think
the
creation
of
rights
or
duties
under
federal
statute
could
encompass
a
broad
range
of
statutes
and
therefore
imply
causes
of
action
under
them.
there
has
to
be
something
more
than
simply
creation
of
a
right
or
duty.
it
has
to
be
something
more
in
the
statute
to
indicate
that
that
right
or
duty
could
be
asserted
by
the
special
class
sought
to
be
benefitted.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
because
otherwise
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
not
explain
such
cases
as
the
--
mr.
john
m.
anderson
well,
it
seems
again
there
are
any
number
of
statutes
which
create
rights
or
duties
or
have
rights
or
duty
language
in
them
and
to
simply
use
that
as
the
talisman
or
the
basis
upon
which
you
are
then
going
to
say
that
because
rights
or
duties
are
created
in
--
in
favor
of
this
class
automatically
that
class
has
standing
to
sue,
a
right
to
sue.
mr.
john
m.
anderson
i
do
not
understand
in
the
case
of
implying
causes
of
action
that
it
is
the
task
of
those
who
are
resisting
implication
to
come
before
the
court
and
offer
proof
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action.
because
mr.
justice
white,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
any
number
of
statutes
as
i
said
earlier
which
have
rights
or
duty
languages
in
it
in
favor
of
certain
specified
or
identifiable
class
but
that
in
and
of
itself
it
seems
to
be
cannot
be
used
as
an
automatic
or
a
checklist
thing
and
furthermore
or
to
shift
in
another
way,
the
burden
to
the
parties
opposing
implication
to
prove
that
congress
did
not
intend.
now
the
advisers
act
is
aimed
at
a
small
specific
segment
of
the
investment
industry
and
that
fact
alone
i
think
is
very
important
because
it
makes
difficult,
at
least,
all
of
these
analogies
to
the
1934
act,
in
analogies
to
the
1934
act
which
are
the
basis
of
the
respondent's
and
the
sec's
argument.
i
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
all
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
under
section
206,
all
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
under
section
215
are
arguments
by
analogy
to
the
1934
act
and
the
1933
act.
and
--
and
even
the
use
of
borak,
a
1934
act
case
is
an
indication
that
what
has
happened
is
that
they
are
arguments
by
analogy.
attention
--
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
