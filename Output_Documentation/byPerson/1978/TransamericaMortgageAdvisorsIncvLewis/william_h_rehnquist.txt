justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
but
doesn't
some
of
the
language
of
the
act
itself
where
it
talks
about
jurisdiction
of
suits
and
equity
and
not
mention
law
suggest
that
there
may
be
a
dichotomy
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
--
what
intimation
do
you
draw
from
our
denial
of
certiorari
in
abrahamson?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
justice
frankfurter
used
to
say
four
justices
didn't
vote
to
grant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
once
a
federal
right
has
been
created,
do
you
mean
once
a
federal
private
right
has
been
created
or
just
once
the
federal
prohibition
has
been
enacted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
this
court's
interpretation
of
last
few
years
or
over
a
period
of
the
generation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
circuit
knew
all
about
piper
and
chris-craft
too,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
if
congress
did
not
either
expressly
or
imply
--
impliedly
create
a
cause
of
action,
this
court
could
do
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hasn't
--
haven't
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
said
that
what
congress
did
or
didn't
do
25
or
30
years
after
the
act
on
which
the
parties
relying
isn't
of
great
significance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
the
1940
act
here,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
question
the
authority
of
the
sec
to
bring
an
injunctive
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
anderson,
in
the
sec's
supplemental
brief,
on
pages
2
and
3,
in
its
summary
of
argument
it
says,
"this
court's
recent
decisions
emphasize
that
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
presents
a
question
of
"statutory
construction.‚Äù
citing
touche
ross
and
cannon,
"in
resolving
that
question,
the
court
has
held,
it
is
necessary
to
determine
'whether
congress
intended
to
create
the
private
right
of
action
asserted."
is
it
really
up
to
us
and
to
consider
all
of
these
policy
considerations
if
congress
has
not
by
implication
or
expressly
created
a
private
cause
of
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
--
who
instructed
you
that
this
court
was
the
court
to
consider
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
then
that
the
language
of
section
80b-15
about
the
validity
of
contracts,
every
contract
made
in
violation
of
any
provisions,
et
cetera,
doesn't
limit
the
extent
of
the
private
right
of
action?
that
someone
who
just
got
a
tout
sheet
and
did
not
actually
enter
into
a
contract,
but
where
a
claimed
fraud
as
a
result
of
it
could
sue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
--
well,
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
sheet
had
said,
"don't
go
to
anybody
but
us."
and
the
private
cause
of
action
alleged
that
he
relied
on
that
and
went
to
the
people
who
sent
out
the
sheet
and
if
he
had
gone
to
somebody
else
he
would've
gotten
good
advice
and
made
good
investments?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
question
in
the
sherman
act,
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
--
here,
we're
talking
about
the
existence
of
a
private
remedy
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
not
about
the
element
of
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
explain
your
language
on
page
3
of
your
supplemental
brief
then
where
you
say
that
in
resolving
that
question
the
court
has
held
it
is
necessary
to
--
to
determine
"whether
congress
intended
to
create
a
private
right
of
action
asserted."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
it
seems
--
in
which
you
were
just
arguing
orally
was
--
it
--
somewhat
at
odds
with
the
language
i
just
quoted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
else
do
you
need?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
certainly
don't
require
that
there
would
--
had
been
a
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
require
that
there
had
been
a
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
no,
i
don't
mean
a
written
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
a
contract
as
defined
in
215.
