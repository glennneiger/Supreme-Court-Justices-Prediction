justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
anderson,
isn't
it
also
true
that
the
--
both
equitable
and
legal
claims
asserted
and
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
entire
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
anderson,
on
that
point
as
i
recall
the
beginning
of
your
argument,
you
said
there
were
state
and
federal
remedies
available
to
clients,
investors
advisers
who
have
been
defrauded.
what
are
the
federal
remedies
that
are
available
to
clients?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
they
don't
have
a
remedy
for
violation
of
section
206
or
whatever
number
this
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
violations
other
than
the
ones
that
are
alleged
in
this
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
defines
from
another
provision
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keisman,
just
going
back
to
your
broader
point
for
the
word
there's
wrong,
there's
going
to
be
a
remedy
basically,
what
do
you
do
with
piper
against
chris-craft?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
difference
you're
saying
and
is
that
dealt
with
for
whom
the
cause
of
action
may
be
applied
or
as
this
deals
with
whether
any
may
be
applied
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ferrara
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
any
of
the
four
factors
identified
in
cort
against
ash
would
suggest
that
one
could
draw
a
distinction
between
legal
and
equitable
remedies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
then
that
perhaps
an
equitable
action
is
consistent
but
a
damage
action
might
be
inconsistent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
they
appear
in
the
33
and
34
acts
as
those
acts
have
express
action
at
law
available
for
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
such
express
action
of
law
available
under
the
statutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
definitely,
it
only
applies
to
investment
advisers
who
defraud
--
who
defraud
their
clients.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
anderson,
do
you
think
the
court
has
decided
any
cases
since
the
last
argument
that
have
any
relevance
to
the
issue
you
are
arguing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
going
to
discuss
any
of
those?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
apparently,
you
don't
think
they
help
you
very
much
or
you
--
i
would
assume
you'd
call
our
attention
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice

--
i
may
have
missed
your
later
brief,
that's
part
of
my
problem.
we
have
filed
a
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
redington
case.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
didn't
get
it.(voice
