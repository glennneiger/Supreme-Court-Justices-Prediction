is
the
question
whether
or
not
there's
a
private
right
of
action
or
whether
or
not
there's
a
private
right
of
action
for
money
damages?
justice
potter
stewart
and
thereby
incurred
the
attack
from
your
adversary?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
question
as
described
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
you
agree
now
that
that
is
the
question
before
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
congress
intended
to
create
a
private
right
of
action
for
equitable
relief.
justice
potter
stewart
that
clearly
is
a
provision
for
suits
for
equitable
relief
brought
by
the
enforcing
agency.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
your
submission,
no
valid
distinction
can
be
made.
justice
potter
stewart
or
can
defend
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
the
ground
that
it
has
no
obligation
because
the
contract
is
void.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
when
i
went
to
law
school,
it
was
considered
there
was
some
difference
between
voidable
and
void.
now,
perhaps,
that
difference
has
been
blurred
in
the
in
so
many
years.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
reasoning
of
the
very
first,
i
think
it's
the
first
case,
that
it
might
have
private
right
of
action
in
the
sec
--
and
other
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
was
in
the
kardon
case
and
that
did
rely
greatly
on
this
floyd
idea,
didn't
it
to
apply
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
back
to
safety
appliance
acts
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
which
was
1935
act?
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
that
quite
answer
my
brother
white's
question,
as
i
understood
his
question
that
is
in
your
submission,
do
you
think
there
is
a
valid
there
is
a
valid
distinction
or
a
valid
distinction
can
be
made
between
the
two
actions?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
by
the
statute
just
as
judge
gurfein
did
in
dissenting
in
the
second
circuit
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
told
us
very
briefly
that
your
argument
is
based
upon
the
economic
motivation
of
private
parties.
justice
potter
stewart
a
great
deal
of
your
argument
is
based
upon
the
(inaudible)
list
provided
by
the
economic
motivation
of
private
parties.
justice
potter
stewart
the
economic
motivation
has
to
do
with
putting
money
in
people's
pocket,
generally.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
anderson,
if
memory
serves,
the
original
argument
in
this
case,
there
were
some
discussion
about
what
the
question
actually
was
before
us.
is
the
question
whether
or
not
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
investment
advisers
act,
or
is
the
question
whether
or
not
there's
a
private
right
of
action
for
money
damages
under
that
act?
justice
potter
stewart
judge
gurfein
did
make
such
a
distinction,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion
anyway,
so
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
all
dicta.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
on
your
side.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
present
case,
judge
wallace
did
no
more
than
say
he
agreed
with
judge
gurfein?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
there
is
an
--
an
action
for
money
damages.
justice
potter
stewart
for
both.
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
one
--
we
have
one
from
the
sec,
filed
on
september
25th.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940
was
enacted
to
deal
with
abuses
that
congress
had
found
to
exist
in
the
investment
advisers
industry.
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
act
creates
a
private
cause
of
action
for
damages
or
for
other
relief.
the
trial
court
ruled
that
the
investment
advisers
act
confers
no
private
right
of
action
and
accordingly
dismissed
the
plaintiff’s
complaint
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
and
i'm
quoting,
“implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
for
injunctive
relief
and
damages
in
favor
of
appropriate
plaintiffs
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
goals
of
congress
in
enacting
the
legislation.”
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
important
federal
question
presented.
the
case
was
argued
in
the
1978
term
and
was
reargued
last
month.
the
investment
advisers
act
nowhere
expressly
provides
for
a
private
cause
of
action.
the
only
provision
of
the
act
that
authorizes
any
suits
to
enforce
the
duties
or
obligations
created
by
it
is
a
section
that
permits
the
securities
exchange
commission
to
bring
suit
in
a
federal
district
court
to
enjoin
violations
of
the
act
or
the
rules
promulgated
under
it.
the
question
whether
a
statute
creates
a
cause
of
action
either
expressly
or
by
implication
is
basically
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
while
some
opinions
of
the
court
have
placed
considerable
emphasis
upon
the
desirability
of
implying
private
rights
of
action
in
order
to
provide
remedies
thought
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
a
given
statute,
what
must
ultimately
be
determined
is
whether
congress
intended
to
create
the
private
remedy
asserted.
it
is
argued
that
the
creation
of
a
private
right
of
action
can
fairly
be
inferred
from
the
language
of
two
sections
of
the
act
before
us
in
this
case.
the
first
is
a
section
that
broadly
proscribes
various
practices
by
investment
advisers.
the
second
is
a
section
that
provides
that
contracts
whose
formation
or
performance
would
violate
the
act
shall
be
void.
as
to
the
second
of
these
sections,
we
have
concluded
that
the
statutory
language
itself
fairly
implies
a
right
to
specific
and
limited
relief
in
a
federal
court.
by
declaring
certain
contracts
void,
that
section
by
its
terms
necessarily
contemplates
that
the
issue
of
voidness
under
its
criteria
may
be
litigated
somewhere.
at
the
very
least,
congress
must
have
assumed
that
the
statutory
provision
could
be
raised
defensively
in
private
litigation
to
preclude
the
enforcement
of
an
investment
adviser’s
contract.
but
the
legal
consequences
of
voidness
are
typically
not
so
limited.
a
person
with
the
power
to
void
a
contract
ordinarily
may
resort
to
a
court
to
have
the
contract
rescinded
and
to
obtain
restitution
of
consideration
paid.
and
the
federal
courts
in
general
have
viewed
such
language
in
statutes
as
implying
an
equitable
cause
of
action
for
rescission
or
similar
relief.
for
these
reasons,
we
conclude
that
when
congress
declared
that
certain
contracts
are
void,
it
intended
that
the
customary
legal
incidence
of
voidness
would
follow
including
the
availability
of
a
suit
for
rescission
or
for
an
injunction
against
continued
operation
of
the
contract
and
for
restitution.
we
view
quite
differently
however
the
respondent's
claims
for
damages
and
other
monetary
relief
under
the
other
section
at
issue.
that
section
simply
prohibits
certain
conduct
and
does
not
in
terms
create
or
alter
any
civil
liabilities.
if
monetary
liability
to
a
private
plaintiff
is
to
be
found,
it
must
be
read
into
the
legislation.
yet
it
is
an
elemental
canon
of
statutory
construction
that
where
a
statute
expressly
provides
a
particular
remedy
or
remedies,
a
court
must
be
chary
of
reading
others
into
it.
congress
expressly
provided
both
judicial
and
administrative
means
for
enforcing
compliance
with
the
section
in
question.
first,
willful
violations
are
criminal
offenses
punishable
by
fine
or
imprisonment
or
both.
second,
the
securities
exchange
commission
is
authorized
to
bring
civil
actions
in
federal
courts
to
enjoin
compliance.
third,
the
commission
is
authorized
to
impose
various
administrative
sanctions.
in
view
of
these
express
provisions
for
enforcing
the
duties
imposed,
we
think
it
is
highly
improbable
that
congress
absentmindedly
forgot
to
mention
and
intended
private
action.
for
the
reasons
i
have
outlined,
all
of
which
are
discussed
in
considerably
greater
detail
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
this
morning
we
hold
that
there
exist
a
limited
private
remedy
under
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940
to
void
an
investment
adviser's
contract
but
that
the
act
confers
no
other
private
causes
of
action,
legal
or
equitable.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
written
opinion
of
this
court.
mr.
justice
powell
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
statement.
and
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
joined.
