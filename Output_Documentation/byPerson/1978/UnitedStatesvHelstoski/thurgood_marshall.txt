fairness.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
stavis,
am
i
right
that
your
client
voluntarily
gave
the
legislative
count
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
is
that
--
do
you
take
position
that
if
a
congressman
is
up
for
anything
and
he
voluntarily
gives
a
legislative
thing,
he
can't
be
indicted
from
then
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
he
is
immunized
forever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
he
voluntarily
didn't
he,
he
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he?
but
didn't
he
bring
these
bills
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
didn't
he
bring
the
bills
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
he
bring
the
legislative
matters
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
he
complains
about
bringing
them
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
he
complains
about
bringing
them
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
what
is
he
complaining
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
be
immunized
and
we're
all
going
to
bank
in
to
the
state
of
alaska.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
too
sure
you
wouldn't
go
so
far
to
say
he'd
be
immunized
from
robbing
a
bank
in
great
britain.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,

overlap)
where
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
give
me
an
idea,
i
can
find
it,
can
you
give
me
an
idea.
justice
thurgood
marshall
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
fact
you
can't
--
didn't
remember
it,
makes
me
think
it
might
not
help
you
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
couldn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
brand,
congress
i
assume
could
amend
the
201
and
the
other
bribery
statute
and
say,
“they
do
not
apply
to
congressmen.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
aren't
you
now
doing
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
aren't
you
trying
to
get
us
to
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
wasn't
questioned
in
the
grand
jury,
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
isn't
the
grand
jury
in
an
article
iii
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
partially?
