justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
for
your
theory
if
he
had,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
was
aware
that
he
was
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
it
does,
why
can't
that
institution
provide
for
its
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
neither
one
can
waiver
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
congress
cannot
by
however
narrow
a
piece
of
legislation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
provide
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
the
executive
prosecution
of
a
legislative
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
--
in
that
new
indictment
or
in
those
new
grand
jury
proceedings
or
in
the
subsequent
trial,
the
evidence
the
government
now
proposes
to
use
you
would
say
would
be
unusable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
brand,
he
certainly
don't
need
to
--
i
know
you
say
that
he
--
the
evidence
should
never
have
even
been
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
but
even
if
there
was
--
even
if
it
was
properly
presented
or
even
if
it
could
be
said
that
he
waived
in
some
matter
the
presentation
of
the
evidence,
you
still
say
that
he
never
consented
to
be
indicted.
never
consented
to
be
threatened
with
indictment
and
that
would
of
course
solve
a
lot
of
your
problems
if
you
win
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
a
man
who
is
no
longer
a
member?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
did
you
say
that
--
has
congress
doubted
its
power
to
punish
conduct
occurring
in
a
former
congress
by
a
man
who
is
no
longer
a
member?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
i
thought
mr.
stavis
indicated
there
was
an
instance,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
--
but
--
just
so
i
had
it
clear,
but
absent
the
waiver
you
agree
that
under
brewster
in
irrelevant
cases
and
under
the
clause,
you
could
not
introduce
the
evidence
that
you
proposed
to
introduce?
justice
byron
r.
white
pardon
me?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
under
--
that
brewster
it
would
not
require
exclusion
of
a
promise
to
introduce
a
bill
in
return
for
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
was
introduced
to
prove
the
case
that
he
took
money
for
doing
--
for
a
legislative
act
or
for
an
official
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
your
position
was
that
with
a
narrowly
drawn
statute,
congress
could
authorize
the
prosecution
of
congressman
for
the
performance
of
legislative
acts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
relevance
is
your
argument
in
this
case
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
this
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
just
saying
that
congress
with
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
could
authorize
the
executive
to
end
--
to
punish
a
congressman
for
conduct
falling
outside
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
as
far
as
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
argument
--
and
it
also
--
so
that
this
argument
doesn't
affect
whether
or
not
this
evidence
is
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
as
long
as
if
you're
right
on
that,
if
you're
right
on
that
maybe.
but
if
the
court
thought
that
this
involved
evidence
or
conduct
protected
by
speech
or
debate
clause,
your
argument
then
would
fall
by
the
wayside?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
at
least
say
then
that
the
privilege
or
the
immunity
belongs
to
the
member
individually?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
it
also
is
--
it's
something
that
congress
can't
waive
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
asked
you
if
congress
could
by
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
authorize
the
prosecution
for
a
legislative
act,
and
you
said
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
privilege
does
belong
to
the
individual.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
--
but
in
this
case,
i
don't
see
--
is
there
some
evidence
that
he
consented
to
be
prosecuted
for
a
legislative
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
not,
no
did
he
ever
consent
to
be
prosecuted
for
a
legislative
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
asked
him
that,
whatever
is
--
that
you
have
to
--
that
was
my
question
anyway
whether
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
his
answer
was
that
it's
another
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
stavis,
there's
no
evidence
here
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
evidence
here
that
he
--
that
even
if
a
congressman
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
freely
talked
about
legislative
acts,
made
no
objection
whatsoever,
if
he
didn't
go
on
and
say,
“i
also
waive
my
immunity
from
prosecution
for
a
legislative
act”,
he
wouldn't
have
waived
his
immunity
from
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't
any
evidence
like
that
here.
