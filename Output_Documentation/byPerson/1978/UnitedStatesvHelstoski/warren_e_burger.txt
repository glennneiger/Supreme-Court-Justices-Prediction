chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
349,
united
states
against
helstoski
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
stavis,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
was
the
other
person
under
inquiry,
another
member
of
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
opinion
for
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
they
try
these
charges
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
sanction
could
congress
impose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
--
mr.
stavis,
when
the
charge
is
for
taking
money
in
exchange
for
a
promise
of
a
future
act,
hasn't
the
court
held
that
it's
not
necessary
to
show
the
legislative
act
or
the
legislative
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
will
we
know
whether
the
government
is
going
to
try
to
prove
that
until
the
case
is
tried?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
trial
court
excludes
any
evidence
about
the
legislative
acts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
it
say
he
may
not
be
questioned
or
he
may
not
be
required
to
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
there
might
be
another
reason
here
then,
wouldn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
not
sometimes
happen,
mr.
stavis
that
the
prosecution
fails
to
prove
all
of
what
is
alleged
in
an
indictment
and
yet
a
conviction
nevertheless
results?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now
this
trial
judge
has
indicated
that
he
will
in
advance
have
the
advantage
of
his
statement
that
he
would
not
admit
any
testimony
on
that
score
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
mr.
stavis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
bank
in
grand
city
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
doesn't
belong
to
an
individual,
it
belongs
to
an
institution,
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hasn't
congress
or
didn't
congress
take
quite
a
long
step
in
relation
to
the
speech
or
debate
clause
when
they
enacted
these
provisions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
soon
as
it
reached
him,
is
it
not
implied
in
both
johnson
and
the
brewster
case
that
he
not
only
need
not
answer,
he
may
assert
the
proposition
that
he
cannot
be
questioned.
to
give
an
example,
if
he
were
sued
in
a
complaint
in
a
civil
case
for
a
libel
and
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
libel
was
committed
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
could
not
the
member
of
congress
simply
informally
tell
the
court
by
letter
or
any
other
way,
that
he
was
not
going
to
answer
because
the
speech
or
debate
clause
protected
him.
and
he
was
not
going
to
appear
and
that
any
judgment
entered
on
the
basis
of
that
complaint
would
be
a
nullity
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
he
--
it
is
more
than
a
quite
matter
of
not
being
questioned
or
not
answering,
he
can't
even
be
questioned,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
he
then
submitted
to
the
questioning
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
stavis
indicated
that
you
were
going
to
tell
us
about
the
number
of
congressmen,
former
congressmen
punished
by
the
house
or
the
senate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
brand.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view
mr.
solicitor
general,
for
the
government
to
sustain
a
case
needn't
prove
anymore
than
that
the
money
was
taken
and
the
promise
to
do
a
future
act
was
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
--
in
other
words,
does
it
need
to
prove
that
the
bargain
was
fulfilled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
crime
be
consummated
if
the
solicitation
were
shown
but
no
payment
were
shown?
suppose
the
person
solicited
refused
to
pay.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
only
that
there
can,
there
must
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
need
to
decide
in
this
case
whether
congress
could
by
a
very
statute
more
narrowly
drawn
perhaps
than
section
201
submit
to
the
trial
for
a
legislative
acts,
do
we
need
to
decide
that
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
case
could
be
decided
narrowly
on
the
basis
of
brewster
and
johnson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
either
way
apparently,
if
i
--
you
listen
to
the
other
side.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there's
another
alternative,
isn't
there
and
that
is
to
let
them
go
their
way
and
see
what
happens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
stavis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
didn't
--
it
could
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
understood
it
that
way,
i
didn't.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
--
i
thought
he
has
said
congress
has
not
done
that
up
to
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
need
to
decide
whether
what
congress
could
do
in
the
future?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
there
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
(voice
overlap)
anything
that
congress
could
not
do
to
waive
your
rights
or
my
rights
which
you
or
i
individually
might
well
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
give
you
60.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
