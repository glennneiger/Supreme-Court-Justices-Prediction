i
knew
he
was.
justice
potter
stewart
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
under
the
constitution
that
wouldn't
be
authorized
to
impose
a
cruel
or
unusual
punishment,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
going
to
insist
on
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
although
the
constitution
guarantees
that,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
say
anything
about
an
article
iii
trial,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
subject
to
what
constitutional
limitations?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
presumption
of
innocence?
justice
potter
stewart
necessity
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
potter

mr.
stavis,
is
it
clear
that
their
clause
applies
to
a
former
congressman?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
he's
not
now,
any
punishment
by
a
congressman
--
by
congress
would
be
from
now
on.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
do
it
here
because
you
don't
have
to.
justice
potter
stewart
and
courts
don't
have
any
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
he
admit
an
unequivocal
explicit
waiver,
knowing
waiver
voluntarily?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
empowered
to
waive.
justice
potter
stewart
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
except
maybe
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
to
prevent
question
anywhere
in
any
other
place?
justice
potter
stewart
but
can
he
support
a
waiver?
justice
potter
stewart
the
military
once
asserted
jurisdiction
to
punish
its
foreign
members
too,
but
it
got
a
negative
answer
from
this
court,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
when
they
were
members.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
military's
theory
too.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
the
house
has
doubted
its
authority,
it's
true
as
this
court
cited
in
powell
v.
mccormack,
its
authority
to
expel
a
member
for
conduct
which
occurred
before
he
became
a
member
of
congress.
but
it
has
not
doubted
its
power
to
punish
conduct
occurring
in
a
prior
congress.
as
