mr.
morton
stavis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
cases
here
and
the
546,
our
petition,
number
349
of
the
solicitor
general's
petition,
the
facts
in
both
cases
are
quite
simple.
546
which
i
will
deal
with
first
involve
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
try
this
indictment.
and
the
facts
there
obviously
the
indictment
itself
which
charges
a
member
of
congress
with
taking
money
and
conspiring
to
take
money
by
introducing
bills
in
congress,
bills
which
the
indictment
charges
were
in
fact
introduced,
and
the
bills
as
specifically
identified
in
the
indictment.
it
is
plain
from
the
face
of
the
indictment
that
the
grand
jury
which
found
it
heard,
considered
and
relied
upon
proof
of
the
performance
of
legislative
acts.
and
while
it
is
not
clear
from
the
face
of
the
indictment,
it
is
established
in
the
opinion
of
judge
meanor
and
undisputed
that's
the
indicting
grand
jury,
as
the
grand
jury
which
handed
down
this
indictment
received
proofs
of
the
performance
of
legislative
act
from
the
united
states
attorney
not
from
mr.
helstoski.
it
is
also
clear
and
undisputed
that
while
mr.
helstoski
gave
legislative
materials
to
earlier
grand
juries,
not
the
indicting
grand
jury,
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
at
the
time
that
he
gave
such
materials
that
he
was
the
target
of
the
grand
jury,
and
in
fact
somebody
else
was
thereafter
indicted,
tried
and
convicted.
mr.
morton
stavis
if
he
was
a
target?
mr.
morton
stavis
it
--
to
our
fundamental
theory,
it
doesn't.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
waiver
either,
but
i
agree
that
if
our
theory
is
correct
that
this
is
a
jurisdictional
allocation
then
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
at
all.
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
no
somebody
who
had
been
employed
by
the
congressmen
some
eight
years
previously,
was
not
then
employed
and
hadn't
been
employed
for
many,
many
years.
now,
our
position
in
546
is,
and
you
put
your
finger
right
on
it,
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
try
this
indictment.
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
and
that
of
course,
it
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
evidentiary
issues
which
were
involved
in
349.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
attempt
to
match
the
eloquence
of
this
court
and
its
eight
opinions
dealing
with
the
speech
and
the
debate
clause
and
review
or
recant
the
history
of
that
clause
in
its
meaning
in
england
and
in
united
states.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
--
we
--
in
the
third
circuit,
we
certainly
didn't
believe
that
it
was
an
appealable
order.
we
moved
to
dismiss
before
the
third
circuit
on
those
grounds.
the
third
circuit
denied
our
motion.
i
must
confess
that
we
did
not
cross-petition
on
that
particular
issue,
but
it
may
very
well
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
address
that
question
on
its
own
motion
because
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
don't
think
this
matter
is
properly
in
the
court
of
appeals.
candidly,
i
don't
think
the
issue
which
the
government
presented
in
its
petition
or
even
properly
before
this
court,
because
the
entire
factual
foundation
for
the
government's
petition
in
349
is
a
series
of
proposed
profers
of
proof
which
they
asked
the
district
court
to
rule
upon
three
times.
and
the
district
court
refused
to
do
so.
so
there
are
no
facts
before
this
court.
and
349
is
a
wholly
and
an
entirely
supposititious
case.
and
in
that
respect,
i
guess
i
don't
have
to
call
to
your
attention,
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
concurred
in
by
the
chief
justice
only
last
week
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
which
you
addressed
the
question
of
the
proposition
that
this
court
ought
--
to
be
handling
supposititious
cases.
you
get
enough
business
handling
concrete
issues,
and
while
the
other
seven
members
of
the
court
didn't
agree
that
that
principle
applied
to
that
case.
there's
no
question
that
this
court
ordinarily
tries
and
adjudicates
only
concrete
cases.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
accepted
the
suggestion
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
that
respect.
mr.
morton
stavis
that's
correct.
mr.
morton
stavis
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
morton
stavis
may
i
get
back
to
the
issues
in
546
which
is
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
try
--
of
the
district
court
of
an
article
iii
court
to
try
this
indictment.
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
establishes
jurisdictional
allocation
comes
all
through
the
decisions
of
this
court
including
its
latest,
and
there
of
course
is
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
eastland
against
servicemen's
union.
mr.
morton
stavis
i'm
sorry.
mr.
morton
stavis
of
course,
the
opinion
for
the
court.
and
what
you
addressed
there
was
the
fact
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
affects
the
availability
of
judicial
power.
now,
the
corollary
to
approaching
this
matter
from
the
point
of
view
of
jurisdiction
or
the
availability
of
judicial
power
is
that
no
one
says
that
members
of
congress
are
super
citizens
and
speech
or
debate
clause
isn't
free
license
to
take
bribes
and
commit
crimes
and
introduce
bills
that
are
paid
for.
that
the
only
question
is,
which
is
the
proper
courthouse?
is
it
an
article
iii
court
or
is
it
the
congress
of
the
united
states
under
both
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
the
punishment
clause
and
so
that
there
is
no
question
about
it.
my
client
never
has,
does
not
now
nor
will
he
contest
the
jurisdiction
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
try
the
charges
which
we're
involved
with
here.
because
not
exactly
looking
to
be
charged
by
any
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
believe
so.
mr.
morton
stavis
by
way
of
kilbourn
against
thompson
that
congress
has
complete
power
to
impose
any
sanctions
it
chooses
including
--
if
i
read
kilbourn
against
thompson
correctly,
imprisonment.
that's
what
you
said
in
kilbourn.
mr.
morton
stavis
oh,
i
think
there
are
constitutional
limitations
upon
the
exercise
of
its
power.
that's
powell
against
mccormack.
we
expect
that
if
we
act
right
on
this
by
congress,
we
expect
to
insist
upon
the
due
process
hearing.
and
the
whole
panoply
of
rights,
that
would
be
applied
to
any
judicial
hearing
and
that
would
be
a
judicial
hearing.
it's
just
an
exception
to
article
iii
jurisdiction,
but
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no.
no
we
don't
expect
to,
a
jury
trial.
mr.
morton
stavis
guarantees
it,
an
article
iii
trial.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
be
--
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
would
guess
however
that
we
would
accept
the
fact
that
would
not
be
a
jury
trial.
if
we
would
--
if
we
were
entitled
a
jury
trial,
we
would
waive
it.
i
think
the
essence
of
the
punishment
clause
is
that
the
congress
itself
has
that
power.
mr.
morton
stavis
subject
to
due
process
limitations.
mr.
morton
stavis
that's
correct,
subject
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
limitation.
mr.
morton
stavis
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
believe
so,
right
of
confrontation,
right
of
cross-examination,
right
of
counsel
or
--
mr.
morton
stavis
congress
in
the
past
has
so
asserted,
we
do
not
dispute
that
and
besides
as
of
the
time
that
this
indictment
was
found
as
to
helstoski
was
a
member
of
congress.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct
and
we
do
not
dispute
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
but
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct,
and
all
--
all
we
have
to
dispute
here
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
article
iii
court.
mr.
morton
stavis
and
at
the
time
this
indictment
was
found,
congress
clearly
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any.
mr.
morton
stavis
that's
correct.
in
--
mr.
morton
stavis
yes
it
has.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
mr.
brand
speaking
for
the
speaker
--
mr.
morton
stavis
--
will
address
that
particular
question.historically,
it
has
occurred.
i
think
in
fact
it
occurred
in
the
most
famous
corruption
investigation
by
the
congress
in
the
crédit
mobilier
transaction
where
congressman
oakes
ames
was
charged,
tried
and
convicted
but
it
has
--
after
he
was
no
longer
sitting.
and
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
other
examples
of
that
sort.
mr.
morton
stavis
congress
has
enacted
such
a
law,
and
such
a
law
is
on
--
to
that
books
and
has
been
enforced
and
is
valid,
but
not
in
respect
to
the
performance
of
legislative
acts.
in
other
words,
the
johnson
case
which
wasn't
in
fact
tried
under
that
section
is
a
perfect
example.
a
congressman
takes
a
bribe
to
try
to
influence
the
department
of
justice,
the
normal
conflict
of
interest
situation
or
to
take
in
bribe
for
an
act
which
is
not
a
legislative
act
in
nature.
what
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
driving
at
is
that
if
you
want
to
try
a
legislative
act
for
the
connection
with
legislative
act
if
you
want
to
try
the
legislative
process
that
belongs
in
the
congress.
if
you
want
to
try
just
the
question
of
bribery,
not
implicating
the
legislative
process
that
you
may
do
in
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
morton
stavis
and
of
course
that's
your
opinion
in
the
brewster
case.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
held.
and
the
whole
point
of
the
government's
taking
this
case
is
that
they
want
to
get
around
that
decision,
because
in
that
decision,
you
said
at
least
eight
times,
we
counted
them,
that
under
the
brewster
indictment
you
could
not
show
the
actual
performance
of
a
legislative
act.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
that's
what
we
thought
accepting
that
the
government
and
that's
why
we
don't
think
you
would
even
consider
this
case
but
the
government
says,
“please
look
at
our
profers
of
proof,
this
is
really
what
we
want
to
prove.”
we
say,
“those
people
aren't
going
to
testify
that
way
let
alone
the
fact
that
if
they
did
testify
it
wouldn't
be
true.”
where
the
government
is
asking
you
to
make
--
asking
the
district
court
and
asking
you
to
make
rulings
on
advanced
evidentiary
proof.
mr.
morton
stavis
we
want
you
to
hear
the
government's
petition.
mr.
morton
stavis
we
want
you
to
hear
the
government's
petition
as
--
mr.
morton
stavis
sure,
i
want
you
to
hear
my
petition.
mr.
morton
stavis
because
my
petition
--
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
don't
think
it's
not
--
i
think
its
not
any
fair
but
correct.
but
let
me
get
back
mr.
chief
justice
to
your
question,
because
you
said
that
in
brewster
and
you
looked
at
an
indictment
that
did
not
charge
the
performance
of
legislative
acts.
look
at
this
indictment,
on
its
face
it
charges
the
specific
performance
of
designated
and
named
legislative
acts.
now
if
this
case
goes
to
trial,
and
if
you
prove
--
if
the
government
is
permitted
to
prove
the
facts
as
alleged
in
this
indictment,
i'm
talking
about
what
would've
happened
if
they
came
up
with
a
brewster
indictment,
but
if
they
proved
the
facts
alleged
in
this
indictment
that
jury
is
going
to
be
asked
to
decide
questions
as
to
the
functioning
of
the
legislative
process
specifically.
mr.
morton
stavis
well
that's
what
mr.--
that's
what
judge
meanor
said
he
was
going
to
do
and
that's
why
the
government
took
this
case
up.
they
weren't
unsatisfied
with
judge
meanor's
decision
which
said,
“i
read
the
brewster
opinion
and
i
intend
to
enforce
it
and
not
permit
the
introduction
of
legislative
acts.”
the
government
took
it
up
that's
why
this
case
have
been
going
on
now
for
over
two
and
a
half
years
without
a
trial.
now,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
our
position
is
that
in
the
light
of
this
indictment,
the
issues
just
does
not
end
with
the
fact
that
the
government
would
not
be
permitted
to
introduce
that
evidence
at
trial.
and
that's
what
my
petition
is
about.
i
say
that
the
grand
jury
released
and
found
an
indictment
which
on
its
face
is
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
and
what
the
government
is
saying
is,
“well,
let's
fix
up
the
indictment
a
little
bit.”
well,
maybe
they
shouldn't
have
charged
and
alleged
these
legislative
acts
which
they
designate
in
that
indictment.
“well,
we'll
just
strike
it
out.
fix
it
up
and
make
it
like
the
brewster
type
indictment
and
forget
that
it
ever
happened.”
mr.
morton
stavis
before,
the
morals
in
this
specific
legislative
act,
it's
also
the
allegations
in
counts
2
(a)
and
4
of
the
indictment
which
also
include
allegations
of
specific
legislative
acts.
yes,
the
answer
is
if
all
those
words
were
taken
out
then
you'd
have
an
indictment
that
read
like
the
brewster
indictment.
but
the
trouble
about
doing
that
is
that
by
the
issuance
of
the
indictment
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
has
implicated
--
judge
(inaudible)
and
the
grand
jury
has
implicated
and
impugned
the
functioning
of
congress.
now
the
point
that
we
make
is
that
when
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
set
up
to
protect
this
delicate
tripartite
separation
of
powers,
it
means
that
the
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no
problem
about
that.
mr.
morton
stavis
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
provided
that
now
this
is
the
difference,
provided
that
it
had
not
presented
the
legislative
acts
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
they
haven't.
there's
nothing
in
the
world
that
says
that
they
can't
(voice
overlap)
the
grand
jury
and
present
a
case
to
another
grand
jury
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
the
long
case.
in
the
long
case
decided
by
this
court
--
mr.
morton
stavis
indictment
which
charges
legislative
acts.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
mean
--
of
course
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morton
stavis
oh
no!
no,
what
i
mean
is
that
they
can't
--
i
mean
obviously
they
can
indict
him
for
bank
robbery,
something
having
--
they
may
be
able
to
indict
him
for
bank
robbery
having
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
would
be
invalid
because
the
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
has
violated
the
speech
or
debate
clause
but
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
government
cannot
convene
another
grand
jury,
present
the
case
which
does
not
involve
proof
of
legislative
acts
and
come
out
with
the
brewster
type
indictment.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
is
not
like
calandra.
calandra
is
a
very
different
kind
of
a
case.
in
calandra
you
decided
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
--
the
exclusionary
clause
which
is
your
making
that
you
would
allow
a
grand
jury
to
hear
evidence
unlawfully
seized
by
somebody
else.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
understand
that.
but
here
you
have
an
explicit
provision
of
the
speech
--
in
the
constitution
which
says
that
speech
or
debate,
which
i
wish
would
mean
legislative
acts,
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
in
gravel
you
said
that
includes
a
grand
jury.
mr.
morton
stavis
says
he
may
not
be
questioned.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
it
says
may
not
be
questioned.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
he
did
at
the
point
when
he
wasn't
the
target.
mr.
morton
stavis
on
the
fifth
amendment
ground.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
might
be
but
if
i
read
the
gravel
case
accurately
and
i
think
i
do,
there
is
no
speech
or
debate
protection
from
questioning
when
the
grand
jury
is
investigating
third
party
crime.
mr.
morton
stavis
has
laid
it
to
them
voluntarily
and
--
mr.
morton
stavis
--he
must
--
mr.
morton
stavis
he
wasn't
up
for
anything.
mr.
morton
stavis
he
was
subpoenaed
to
testify.
mr.
morton
stavis
he
was
subpoenaed
to
testify
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
stavis
because
he
believes
--
mr.
morton
stavis
he
doesn't
complain
about
bringing
them
there
--
mr.
morton
stavis
--
he
thinks
he
was
acquired
to
bring
them
there.
he
doesn't
complain
about
that
at
all.
what
he
complains
about
is
some
grand
jury
that
he
never
brought
them
before
and
which
turned
the
wheel
and
targeted
him.
mr.
morton
stavis
your
honor,
i've
said
exactly
the
contrary.
mr.
morton
stavis
your
honor
i
said
exactly
the
contrary.
i
say
that
quite
the
contrary,
he
is
subject
to
prosecution
in
an
article
iii
court
by
a
grand
jury
which
doesn't
have
this
material.
he
is
subject
to
prosecution
before
congress
where
this
material
may
properly
be
the
subject
of
inquiry
by
the
court
which
has
jurisdiction.
so
i
do
not
accept
the
suggestion
your
honor
because
i
think
i've
said
exactly
the
contrary.
may
i
reserve
some
of
my
time
--
mr.
morton
stavis
of
course
it
--
of
course
that
happens
but
that
those
are
not
cases
where
you're
dealing
with
an
expressed
constitutional
prescription
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
he
intends
to
comply
with
brewster.
mr.
morton
stavis
--
but
i
just
--
our
position
is
that
the
indictment
is
already
a
violation
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
morton
stavis
under
this
indictment.
mr.
morton
stavis
that's
correct.
mr.
morton
stavis
and
that's
not
any
different
than
what
you
did
in
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct,
it's
precisely
this
position.
mr.
morton
stavis
i'm
sorry?
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
there's
an
expressed
provision
of
the
statutes
which
provides
that
where
an
indictment
is
voided
for
some
reason
not
having
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
offense
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
told
i
think
there's
an
expressed
provision
in
the
united
states
code.
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
but
i'll
be
glad
to
furnish
it
to
--
mr.
morton
stavis
it's
in
the
united
states
code.
mr.
morton
stavis
but
there's
an
expressed
provision
--
i'll
looked
that
up
thinking
about
this
case
and
i
did
look
it
up.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
it
doesn't
help
me
in
the
sense
that
in
an
indictment,
a
new
indictment
can
be
brought
as
i
have
suggested.in
that
sense
it
doesn't
help
me,
but
also
makes
clear
that
the
suggestion
i've
made
as
to
the
potentialities
of
a
new
indictment
is
entirely
feasible.
and
i
just
want
to
say
in
reference
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
that
of
course
is
exactly
what
you
do
in
an
immunity
case.
you
forbid
the
use
of
immunized
testimony.
you
impose
upon
the
prosecutor
an
obligation
to
establish
that
he
didn't
use
immunized
testimony
when
he
got
the
indictment.
if
he
can't
make
it
he
can
go
to
another
grand
jury.
he
can
go
to
another
grand
jury
and
get
an
indictment
without
the
use
of
the
immunized
testimony,
does
that
all
the
time.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
warren
comes
close
to
that.
in
warren
what
you
said
was
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i'm
not
sure
i
could
put
my
fingers
on
a
case
at
the
moment.
may
i
reserve
some
time?
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
he's
given
an
example
of
cases
in
which
former
members
of
congress
were
covered.
mr.
morton
stavis
other
than
the
oakes
ames
case
which
i
mentioned.
mr.
morton
stavis
oakes
ames,
congressman
--
mr.
morton
stavis
congressman
ames
involved
in
the
crédit
mobilier
controversy
around
the
1870's
i
think.
that
was
the
biggest
scandal
case
in
congress
at
the
time.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes
i
do.
mr.
morton
stavis
alright,
thank
you
very
much.
picking
up
the
colloquy
between
the
--
mr.
justice
white
and
solicitor
general,
it
seems
now
to
be
conceded
that
the
congress
cannot
waive
into
an
article
iii
court
trial
of
a
legislative
act.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
cannot
believe
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
that
was
what
the
solicitor
general
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
thought
he
went
further.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
thought
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
you
don't
have
to
decide
this
question,
but
i
thought
i
heard
the
solicitor
general
conceding
that.
if
i'm
wrong,
i'd
respectfully
request
to
be
excused
for
this
error,
but
if
i
am
right
then
what
the
solicitor
general
is
saying
is
that
while
the
whole
body
of
congress
can't
waive
into
an
article
iii
court
one
member
can.
and
it
just
seems
to
me
that
that
falls
of
its
own
way.
mr.
morton
stavis
but
not
when
the
rights
relate
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court.
i
can't
waive
myself
into
this
court,
that's
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested.
we
can't,
by
the
fact
that
i
may
not
even
cross-petition.
i
can't
waive
the
objection
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
third
circuit.
and
if
this
is
jurisdictional
then
the
waiver
argument
doesn't
apply
either
with
respect
to
congress
as
a
whole
or
with
respect
to
an
individual
member
of
the
congress.
now,
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
approach
for
a
moment
--
mr.
morton
stavis
sir.
mr.
morton
stavis
he
not
only
could
answer
them,
but
if
he
is
not
the
target
i
believe
he
is
required
to
answer.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
if
he's
--
mr.
morton
stavis
if
he
is
the
target
and
if
he
answers
then
he
is
probably
subject
to
discipline
by
the
house.
but
he
of
course,
he
can
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
respectfully
suggest
to
you
that
you
look
at
jefferson's
manual
which
is
recorded
in
our
brief
in
which
he
says,
“yes,
he
may
not
waive
that
privilege
of
the
house
of
speech
or
debate.
but
even
if
the
house
should
overlook
that
and
he
has
waived
it
then
he
has
testified
--
he
has
testified.
the
next
question
is,
what's
the
consequence
of
that
testimony?
does
that
waive
him
into
an
article
iii
court
when
the
constitution
says
the
article
iii
court
has
no
jurisdiction?
i've
never
been
able
to
go
to
a
courthouse
and
say,
“please
take
this
case
even
though
you
don't
have
jurisdiction.”
mr.
morton
stavis
the
grand
jury
is
partially
in
an
article
iii
court
that
--
mr.
morton
stavis
partially,
as
it's
also
i
think
something
else
too.
i
think
it's
an
honor
of
the
executive.
mr.
morton
stavis
i've
been
lit
up
but
if
i
--
mr.
morton
stavis
--
i'd
like
to
add
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morton
stavis
of
course
not,
and
he
never
even
said
--
mr.
morton
stavis
not
in
the
slightest,
not
in
the
slightest.
may
i
have
30
seconds?
and
then
he
--
mr.
morton
stavis
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
i
want
to
focus
on
my
case
in
just
a
moment
and
that
is
the
indictment.
and
particularly
on
what
may
be
attractive
to
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
which
is,
“well
let's
just
fix
up
this
indictment.”
and
i
simply
want
to
say
that
the
consequence
of
that
is
that
you
remove
the
effective
operation
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
at
the
point
where
it's
most
important
namely
where
it
is
accusatory.
now
in
kilbourn
against
thompson
that
used
the
meaning
of
the
term
questioning
was
not
mr.
justice
stevens'
in
terms
of
do
you
ask
a
question.
it
is
rather,
may
you
make
a
charge.and
i
respectfully
refer
you
to
mr.
justice
miller's
opinion
in
which
he
equates
the
speech
or
debate
clause
the
term
questioning
to
the
language
of
the
massachusetts
constitution
which
refers
to
accusation.
if
you
take
that
concept
and
then
move
over
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
and
say,
“is
there
any
case
where
you
set
aside
an
indictment
because
there's
something
that
happened
in
the
grand
jury?”
and
i
say
that
that's
exactly
what
you
do
in
the
immunity
type
case
where
a
grand
jury
heard
testimony
that
was
barred
from
him,
they
shouldn't
have
heard
him.
and
you
say
to
that
prosecutor,
“well
if
you
did
it,
we
cancel
that
indictment.
if
you
want
to
go
ahead
and
not
use
that
prohibited
testimony,
you're
free
to
do
so.”
and
that's
all
we've
ever
said
here,
and
if
the
prosecutor
should
decide
not
to
do
that,
in
any
event
we
said
that
the
congress
has
jurisdiction.
and
i'm
very
grateful
to
you,
your
honor,
for
indulging
me
to
that
extent.
