mr.
stanley
m.brand
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
representing
the
honorable
thomas
p.o'neil,
speaker,
the
honorable
frank
thompson,
chairman
and
the
honorable
william
dickenson,
ranking
minority
member
committee
on
house
administration
of
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
as
amici
curiae.t
he
interest
of
the
speaker
and
his
colleagues
in
this
case
is
apparent.
it
presents
serious
questions
in
our
minds
as
to
the
continued
viability
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
clear.
the
congress
has
read
johnson
and
brewster
and
that
congress
accepts
johnson
and
brewster.
when
we
saw
the
solicitor's
petition
however,
and
what
we
viewed
as
an
attempt
to
relitigate
brewster,
we
were
concerned,
and
that's
why
we
are
here.
to
paraphrase
thomas
jefferson's
characterization
of
the
clause
which
he
wrote
shortly
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
“the
clause
is
intended
to
protect
the
substance
rather
than
the
shadow
of
representative
government,
and
for
that
reason
it
states
for
any
speech
or
debate
they
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.”
we
believe
that
this
clause
operates
as
an
institutional
protection
as
well
as
a
personalized
privilege.
and
to
affect
this
high
principle
of
an
unfettered
legislative
branch,
the
framers
concluded
that
a
jurisdictional
allocation
was
necessary.
and
we
read
this
jurisdictional
allocation
from
the
speech
or
debate
clause
read
together
with
the
punishment
clause.
like
other
jurisdictional
requirements,
the
trial
of
legislative
acts
must
occur
in
a
proper
forum.
it
is
not
subject
to
waiver,
congressman
helstoski
cannot
waive
himself
into
an
article
iii
court
for
the
trial
of
legislative
acts.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
that's
right.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
that's
our
position.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
--
any
more
than
two
litigants
could
present
themselves
to
an
article
iii
court
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
--
without
a
case
of
controversy
and
say,
“we
would
like
the
court
nevertheless
to
try
this
case.”
mr.
stanley
m.brand
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
because
the
clause
is
a
protection
for
the
member
as
well
even
as
against
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
--
a
hostile
congress.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
it
protects
unpopular
members
as
well
as
popular
members
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
--
democrats
as
well
as
republicans.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
that's
right.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
any
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
that's
right,
any
more
than
we
could
delegate
impeachment
for
instance.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
they
could
do
that.
our
position
would
be
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
no
sir,
we
don't
believe
we
are.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
i
don't
think
so.
what
we're
saying
is
as
you
said
in
brewster,
these
cases
can
go
forward
without
impugning
legislative
acts,
and
that's
what
we
are
saying
here.
the
residuent
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
we
do.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
we
do
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
although
we
agree
also
that
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
u.s.
attorney
from
taking
the
non-legislative
material
presenting
it
to
a
new
grand
jury
and
indicting
and
going
forward
to
trial.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
if
that
in
fact
is
a
problem.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
i
don't
think
so
your
honor,
201
like
a
plethora
of
other
statutes
regulating
non-legislative
behavior
has
been
passed
by
congress
in
that
context.
we
have
statutes
for
instance,
18
u.s.c.
431
says
that
a
member
may
not
enter
into
a
contract
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
that's
not
a
legislative
act,
we
regulate
that
by
statute.
we
regulate
campaign
financing,
because
we
say
that
when
a
member
takes
a
political
contribution
or
campaigns
for
office,
he
is
not
engaging
in
the
legislative
process
and
we
regulate
that
through
the
united
states
code.
i
don't
believe
you
can
read
201
in
the
context
of
the
u.s.
code
in
the
other
ways
in
which
we
regulate
members
congress
--
conduct
as
the
one
example
where
we
have
attempted
to
put
into
article
iii
courts
the
trial
of
legislative
acts.
i
don't
believe
that's
consistent
with
the
design
of
the
code
at
this
time.
at
this
point
we
come
to
the
question
of
the
indictment.
we
would
say
that
there
having
been
neither
a
waiver
nor
a
delegation
under
201.
the
indictment
at
issue
here
which
charges
legislative
acts
on
the
basis
of
what
the
grand
jury
heard
is
fatally
defective.
and
we
say
this
for
several
reasons.
this
is
not
calandra
and
the
fourth
amendment.
this
is
not
costello
and
the
fifth
amendment.
this
is
the
speech
or
debate
clause
which
is
part
of
the
constitution,
which
the
framers
placed
in
the
constitution
to
protect
questioning
at
the
earliest
possible
juncture,
not
after
indictment
when
the
death
blow
has
been
dealt
as
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
our
position
would
not
--
denying
that.
the
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
--
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well,
if
it's
never
asserted
it
never
becomes
an
issue,
but
in
this
case
the
grand
jury
which
ultimately
indicted
him
was
one
which
there
could
be
no
waiver
because
he
never
appeared
before
that
grand
jury.
what
we're
saying
on
the
indictment
issue
is
that
the
indictment
is
defective
because
the
design
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
to
present
--
prevent
questioning.
if
the
questioning
has
already
occurred
and
you
are
willing
to
say
that
we
will
only
at
trial
put
on
some
evidentiary
prescriptions
then
you
have
not
remedied
the
potential
abuse
which
exists.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
the
legislative
acts.
it
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
i
believe
they
were
directed
to
the
defendant.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well,
under
mr.
stavis'
formulation
and
i
think
we
would
agree
with
most
of
that.
a
member
must
answer
as
to
third
party
crime
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well
as
i
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well,
wouldn't
he
be
--
would
the
same
situation
occur
where
he
never
appeared
and
the
u.s.
attorney
went
to
the
library
of
congress
and
took
the
legislative
material
out
off
there,
is
that
a
questioning?
he
would
never
have
appeared
to
assert
the
privilege
yet
we
would
assert
that
that's
prohibited.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
that
the
grand
jury
can't
hear
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
that's
correct,
he
as
a
claimant
in
a
article
iii
court
could
come
in
and
claim
that
he
should
get
a
remedy
from
the
court.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well
again,
i
believe
that
the
heart
of
the
clause
is
protection
of
the
congress
from
coordinate
branches.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
the
one
that
he
was
indicted
by?
mr.
stanley
m.brand
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
he
did
not.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
of
course
the
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well
of
course
the
court
--
the
clause
doesn't
say
either
that,
it
is
merely
that
evidence
shall
not
be
presented.
we
would
read
“shall
not
be
questioned”
to
include
the
questioning
of
his
legislative
acts
whether
or
not
he
is
the
authoror
or
not.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
that
at
time
and
the
grand
jury
he
was
not.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
but
in
this
case
there
was
the
--
a
mechanism
for
calling
out
the
legislative
acts
by
presenting
--
the
u.s.
attorney
by
presenting
them
to
the
--
by
not
presenting
them
to
the
indicting
grand
jury.
there
was
a
mechanism
but
it
wasn't
used.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well,
our
authority
would
be
the
residual
--
the
inherent
power
of
the
body
is
punished,
contempts
committed
by
its
members
at
the
time
they
were
members
for
conduct
which
occurred
when
they
were
members.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well,
that
report
raised
doubts
as
to
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
and
those
cases
against
those
former
members
were
dropped
for
other
reasons.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
i
believe
it
did.
we're
talking
again
about
what
we
would
say
is
the
inherent
power
of
the
body
to
punish
members
not
as
private
citizens
but
for
conduct
which
occurred
in
the
body
when
they
were
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
--
when
they
were
members.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
no,
in
that
case
he
was
a
member
of
the
42nd
congress,
although
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
i'm
not
sure
if
there's
ever
expressed
any
view
on
that.our
view
of
the
self
disciplinary
process
as
it
is
evolving
at
this
stage
would
be
that
we
would
have
the
power
to
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
there
is
none
that
i
can
get
to.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
see
that
--
i
can
cite
to
none.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well
he
talked
about
the
crédit
mobilierscandal.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
and
that
was
disciplined
in
the
42nd
congress
for
what
occurred
in
the
40th.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
of
an
--
sitting
member
of
congress.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
if
the
chief
justice
would
indulge
me
for
one
minute
i
would
simply
state
--
mr.
stanley
m.brand
--
that
the
self-disciplinary
process
is
an
evolving
process.
to
say
that
the
legislative
acts
will
go
unpunished
is
not
correct.
legislative
misbehavior
and
misconduct
is
not
immunized.
the
house
has
taken
cognizance
of
acts
committed
by
its
members
which
impugn
the
integrity
of
a
process.
it's
an
evolving
process.
it
is
not
static.
we
are
currently
considering
proposals
for
instance,
to
impanel
grand
juries
of
members
on
a
random
basis.
we
are
proceeding
a
pace
with
a
self
disciplinary
process.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
no
sir.
and
i
would
leave
with
this
thought
that
the
solicitor
has
indicated
in
his
brief
that
the
congress
can't
do
both,
they
can't
discipline
appropriately
and
also
legislate.
i
believe
the
record
is
clear
that
we
can
discipline
with
justice
through
law
that
we
can
do
it
with
due
process
that
we
can
do
it
with
the
full
panoply
of
protections
and
shields
that
apply
in
a
criminal
case,
witness
the
material
we've
submitted
for
the
record
on
that.
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
m.brand
well,
