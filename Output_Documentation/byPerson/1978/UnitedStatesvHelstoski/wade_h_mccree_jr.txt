mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
june
1976,
respondent
was
indicted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
jersey
on
several
charges
arising
out
of
grand
jury
investigations
into
alleged
corruption
in
connection
with
private
immigration
legislation.
count
one
charged
him
as
a
member
of
congress
with
conspiracy
to
violate
the
official
bribery
statute,
that's
18
u.s.c.
section
201
(c)
(1),
by
acting
with
albert
defalco,
his
former
administrative
aid
and
others,
to
solicit
and
to
receive
bribes
in
return
for
being
influenced
to
introduce
private
bills
in
the
house
of
representatives.
13
overt
acts
in
furtherance
to
the
conspiracy
were
alleged.
these
overt
acts
consisted
of
charges
that
respondent
and
his
administrative
aid
met
with
attorneys
who
specialize
in
immigration
litigation
and
from
whom
they
received
cash
payments
in
return
for
being
influenced
to
introduce
private
bills
for
named
aliens.
the
other
three
overt
acts
with
which
we're
concerned
here,
2,
3
and
4
also
allege
the
actual
introduction
of
such
bills.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
precisely
the
government's
position,
if
the
court
please.
the
offense
was
to
solicit
bribes
to
perform
an
official
act
and
the
offense
is
complete
once
the
bribe
is
solicited
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
show
that
an
official
act
was
in
fact
done
in
response
to
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
act,
if
the
court
please,
it
would
be
under
201
(c)
the
act
is
in
fact
completed
when
the
solicitation
is
made
for
the
purpose
of
being
influenced.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
exactly
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
do
not
--
we
do
not
disagree
with
judge
meanor
if
a
waiver
took
place.
we
agree
that
judge
meanor
is
correct
that
we
could
not
show
the
introduction
of
the
bills
which
is
the
showing
of
legislative
acts
unless
a
valid
waiver
occurred.
but
we
contend
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
submit
that
a
valid
waiver
occurred
when
mr.
helstoski
voluntarily
presented
voluminous
correspondents
including
copies
of
the
very
bills
that
he
introduced
after
he
was
told
that
he
needn't
--
that
he
was
not
required
to
do
that.
and
he
did
it
voluntarily
and
as
judge
meanor
found,
he
knew
of
his
speech
or
debate
privilege
when
he
did
it.
although
it
was
not
called
directly
to
his
attention,
he
had
raised
this
privilege
in
other
litigation
involving
the
alleged
abuse
of
the
franking
privilege.
and
in
fact
in
his
penultimate
appearance
before
the
grand
jury,
he
also
invoked
the
speech
or
debate
privilege,
and
so
judge
meanor's
finding
that
he
knew
it
is
amply
supported
and
the
u.s.
attorney
told
him
that
he
did
not
have
to
submit
these
matters.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
do.
we
concede
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
i'd
like
to
move
perhaps
right
on
to
the
nature
of
the
evidence
that
is
involved
here.
we
think
that
this
evidence
falls
into
three
categories.
first,
the
bills
themselves
which
as
i've
just
responded
are
clearly
legislative
acts,
evidence
of
legislative
acts
and
absent
a
waiver,
we
agree
that
we
could
not
introduce
those.
there's
a
second
category
of
evidence
and
this
consists
of
correspondence
between
helstoski,
defalco,
some
of
the
attorneys
who
represented
some
of
the
aliens
and
some
of
the
aliens
themselves.
now
we
submit
that
these
evidence
has
to
be
examined
by
the
district
court
on
an
item
by
item
basis
to
see
whether
it
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
we
believe
that
that
is
not
barred
from
evidence
because
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
even
though
it
refers
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
to
something
he
did
or
didn't
do
because
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
exactly,
but
he
may
not
have
done
it.
if
there's
a
letter
saying,
“if
you
give
me
a
certain
sum
of
money,
i
will
cause
a
private
bill
to
be
introduced
for
you.”
this
is
clearly
not
a
legislative
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
as
i
read
brewster,
brewster
would
not
require
its
exclusion
because
it
relates
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
assume
that
as
--
let
us
assume
that
that's
a
false
statement
that
he
did
not
in
fact
introduce
a
private
bill,
but
he
said
this
for
the
purpose
of
eliciting
a
payment.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
agree
that
they
would
be
excluded,
yes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
submit
that
it's
admissible
that
the
court
should
find
that
it's
admissible
for
that
purpose
because
soliciting
a
bribe
is
clearly
and
concededly
not
in
a
legislative
act.
and
whatever
inducement
he
may
employ
for
the
purpose
of
soliciting
the
bribe
can
not
therefore
a
legislative
act
and
that
that
is
not
forbidden
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
that
is
the
way
i
read
that
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
past-future
dichotomy
is
not
a
valid
one.
we
submit
that
the
court
is
--
the
district
court
was
too
restrictive
because
under
the
old
hillman
case
for
example,
a
statement
of
a
present
intention
to
do
something
in
the
future
can
be
the
basis
for
a
finding
that
it
was
in
fact
done.
and
so
we
think
logically,
the
court
should've
--
should
not
even
have
made
the
past-future
dichotomy
and
should've
said
that
in
both
instances,
evidence
would
be
admissible.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
this
is
also
my
understanding
and
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
but
the
district
judge
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
said
that
the
reference
to
the
past
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
is
not.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
submit
that
it
would
because
that
statement
might
be
false,
and
if
he
said
that
for
the
purpose
of
eliciting
a
further
payment
and
he
had
not
in
fact
introduced
a
bill,
he
wouldn't
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
do
and
we
concede
however
that
unless
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
exactly
and
we
contend
that
this
is
an
order
suppressing
evidence
under
3731,
and
as
such
it's
appealable
if
the
appeal
were
taken
before
the
defendant
was
placed
in
jeopardy.
and
we
submit
that
the
provision
itself
admonishes
us
to
give
it
a
liberal
construction
to
effectuate
its
purposes
that
is
to
allow
the
government
to
have
a
ruling
before
a
defendant
is
placed
in
jeopardy.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
a
difficult
question,
if
the
court
please.
an
order
in
(inaudible)
which
is
really
what
it
is,
indicating
what
evidence
might
or
might
not
be
introduce
is
admissible
under
some
systems
or
procedure.
now
whether
the
federal
rules
or
criminal
procedure
permit
it,
i
can't
direct
the
court's
attention
to
a
specific
provision.
but
in
this
case
the
court
did
and
the
court
had
the
matter
properly
before
it
on
the
--
on
mr.
helstoski's
motion
to
dismiss.
then
mr.
helstoski
raised
several
questions
about
the
evidence
and
the
court
in
its
ruling,
in
fact
in
its
first
ruling,
its
our
ruling,
it
said
that
we
would
have
to
redact
the
indictment.
but
in
a
subsequent
written
opinion
it
indicated
that
we
didn't
have
to
redact
the
indictment
but
that
as
the
court
has
already
pointed
out,
we
could
show
evidence
of
promises
to
perform
future
legislative
acts,
but
not
past
ones.
and
so
we
submit
that
the
court
did
in
fact
suppress
evidence,
and
we
suggest
that
although
this
court
hasn't
decided
the
question,
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
in
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
done
exactly
this.
one
case
that
i
recall
is
batiste
versus
the
united
states,
in
which
the
sixth
circuit
decided
that.
and
another
one
in
which
the
--
this
court
denied
certiorari,
that's
united
states
versus
craig
from
the
seventh
circuit.
we
suggest
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
creates
immunity
for
a
congressman
from
civil
or
criminal
liability
for
his
legislative
acts
and
we
concede
that
it
shouldn't
be
construed
as
narrowly
as
just
a
speech
or
a
debate
in
the
congress,
but
that
it's
the
kind
of
act
that's
generally
done
in
furtherance
of
a
legislative
process
which
certainly
doesn't
include
soliciting
a
bribe.
and
so
we
say
that
there
is
an
immunity
for
prosecution
for
a
legislative
act.
we
further
submit
that
the
court
has
developed
an
evidentiary
privilege,
an
implementation
of
this
immunity.
and
as
the
court
has
done
with
the
other
privileges,
evidentiary
privileges
that
it
has
created,
that
we
suggest
that
the
shield
should
not
be
any
roader
than
is
necessary
to
protect
the
interest
for
which
it
was
established.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
we
suggest
too
that
it
is
waivable.
and
in
this
respect
of
course
there
isn't
any
question
but
that
mr.
helstoski
made
a
gesture
before
the
grand
jury
of
a
clean
breast
of
everything.
“i
want
the
grand
jury
to
know
that
i
have
nothing
to
hide”
and
he
brought
in
all
of
these
materials
although
he
was
told
that
he
was
not
required
to
do
this.
and
to
permit
him
to
do
this
and
then
to
assert
a
privilege
would
be
to
make
a
mockery
our
off
the
privilege
because
he
would
just
have
it
one
way
and
not
both
ways.
and
the
court
does
not
permit
that
in
other
matters
and
we
see
no
reason
why
it
should
in
this
matter.
we'd
also
like
to
suggest
that
there's
another
reason
why
the
district
--
why
this
indictment
is
good
and
why
the
district
court's
restriction
on
evidence
should
be
reversed.
we
advanced
the
theory
in
brewster
that
was
suggested
in
johnson
that
if
there
were
a
narrowly
statute,
narrowly
drawn
to
achieve
the
end
of
regulating
the
conduct
of
its
business,
that
the
congress
could
then
involve
the
executive
branch
and
the
judicial
branch
in
it's
--
in
the
discipline
of
its
members.
and
we
suggest
that
in
section
201
the
congress
has
done
exactly
that
in
its
definition
of
who
is
an
official.
for
the
purpose
of
section
201,
it
specifically
provides
that
a
member
of
the
congress
is,
and
then
it
specifically
sets
forth
the
offenses
which
the
defined
officials
cannot
--
i'm
--
may,
of
which
they
may
be
found
guilty.
so
clearly,
this
is
a
statute
narrowly
drawn
to
achieve
the
end
of
regulating
the
conduct
of
its
members.
and
we
suggest
that
there's
a
good
reason
for
it
too.
and
my
brother
who
was
arguing
here
a
few
moments
ago
suggested
or
stated
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
court
that
a
jury
wouldn't
be
available
if
a
member
of
the
congress
was
called
on
for
trial.
the
congress
has
decided
that
for
this
purpose
with
the
third
branch
involvement
there
will
be
a
jury,
there
can
be
confrontation,
right
of
counsel.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
must
be,
i
thank
the
court
for
the
correction.
there
must
be.
and
we
submit
that
the
congress
has
indeed
done
this
with
a
carefully
drawn
statute
which
distinguishes
it
from
johnson.
this
court
didn't
address
this
question
in
brewster
although
the
government
briefed
it.
but
we
suggest
that
this
is
another
basis
for
arriving
at
the
result
that
we
request.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
do.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
these
are
clearly
legislative
acts
and
i
would
have
difficulty
with
that,
my
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well
there
--
what
they
are
doing
is
asserting
that
members
may
be
tried
for
non-legislative
acts,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
the
soliciting
of
a
bribe.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well
this
is
really
in
response
to
the
argument
that
the
congress
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
disciplining
of
its
members.
and
we
don't
think
that
we
have
to
labor
that
because
we
think
if
the
court
is
to
agree
with
his
argument
there,
it
would
have
to
reverse
brewster.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
we
don't
understand
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no.
if
the
court
please,
i
did
not
mean
to
give
that
impression,
if
i
did
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
this
is
just
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
this
is
just
a
second
argument
why
the
congress
with
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
could
involve
the
executive
branch
and
the
judicial
branch
in
the
disciplining
of
its
members.
in
addition
to
the
argument
that
prevailed
in
brewster,
identifying
the
act
is
a
non-legislative
act,
the
taking
of
the
bribes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
as
far
as
that
argument
goes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
only
in
this
sense
that
since
this
is
a
non-legislative
act,
evidence
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
soliciting
a
bribe,
evidence
can
be
introduced
in
support
of
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
would
have
to
go
to
our
waiver
argument.
it
would
fall
by
the
wayside
and
only
a
waiver
would
permit
a
prosecution
for
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
on
in
--
it
was
referred
--
with
respect
to
the
waiver
we
do.
and
we
suggest
that
we
it
would
be
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
suggest
--
that
the
entire
congress?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
superficial
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct
and
i
will
not
retreat
from
that
position.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
i'm
suggesting
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
belongs
to
the
individual.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
does
indeed.
and
i
suggest
that
to
allow
an
individual
to
have
it
both
ways
is
contrary
to
our
whole
system
of
jurisprudence
that
if
he
doesn't
claim,
if
he
does
expressly
waive,
clearly
we
think
he
can
be
prosecuted.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no
he
did
not
expressly
waive,
but
we
have
this
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
he
did
not
consent
to
be
prosecuted
for
a
legislative
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
need
not
because
the
act
here,
soliciting
for
a
bribe
is
clearly
and
concededly
not
a
legislative
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
believe
that
it
can,
but
we
believe
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
believe
however
that
judge
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
too
restrictive
and
that
judge
meanor
was
too
restricted
--
restrictive
and
this
court
should
reverse
that
decision
of
the
third
circuit
to
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
another
course
that's
available
to
the
court
too.
but
we
think
that
the
district
judge
could
benefit
from
the
guidance
of
this
court
in
indicating
what
was
referred
to
in
brewster
as
acts
relating
to
legislative
acts
and
not
legislative
acts
themselves.
mr.

we
believe
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
believe
the
government
has
such
a
case
and
we
have
filed
with
the
court
a
sealed
appendix
that
i
think
contains
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
but
we
would
like
to
take
the
strongest
case
we
can.
my
brother
didn't
speak
about
his
mandamus
action
and
at
least
that
aspect
of
it
there
was
a
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
denial
of
his
petition
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
right
there.
and
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
about
that,
i
would
not
discuss
that
in
argument
here.
if
the
court
please,
then
that
concludes
the
argument
of
the
government
in
this
manner.
