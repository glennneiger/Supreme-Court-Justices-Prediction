justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stavis,
do
you
agree
that
if
they
strike
the
allegations
of
the
specific
overt
acts
describing
legislative
acts
that
the
indictment
would
then
be
comparable
to
the
indictment
in
the
brewster
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
stavis,
would
you
say
then
that
if
before
the
defendant
is
put
in
jeopardy,
the
def
--
the
government
can
come
in
and
voluntarily
dismiss
the
indictment,
that
permission
to
dismiss
the
indictment
then
reindict
it
leaving
out
all
the
references
to
legislative
acts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
still
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
would've
done
what
you
just
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
having
presented
the
legislative
acts
to
the
grand
jury
that
he
have
given
him
permanent
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
your
position
then
just
so
i
get
is
that
having
told
a
particular
grand
jury
about
a
legislative
act
by
a
congressman,
that
grand
jury
may
never
return
an
indictment
against
that
congressman?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
said
that
in
a
moment
ago
if
they
dismissed
the
indictment
and
brought
a
new
one
would
--
didn't
make
reference,
its
still
be
bad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
they
just
excised
from
the
new
indictment
any
reference
to
the
legislative
acts
and
they
merely
follow
the
pattern
of
the
brewster
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
one
question
before
you
do.
you
mentioned
the
jurisdictional
for
former
members
would
be
covered
in
your
colleague's
argument,
but
as
i
look
at
his
brief,
he
gives
us
some
example
of
five
former
members
over
whom
congress
say
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction?
maybe
he
will
cover
it,
but
i
would
like
to
be
advised
on
that
if
it's
incorrect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
happen
to
know
such
a
case
yourself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
give
me
that
again,
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
congressman
ames?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
mr.
brand,
he
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
he
didn't
testify
before
this
grand
jury,
did
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
didn't
testify
before
that
grand
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
position
has
to
be
that
evidence
of
legislative
acts
is
inadmissible
before
the
grand
jury
even
though
the
man
itself
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
clause
doesn't
read
that
way.
it
says
that
the
congressman
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place,
it
doesn't
say
the
evidence
of
legislative
act
shall
not
be
admissible
before
a
grand
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
if
he
--
mentioned
even
acknowledged
with
third
party
crime
evidence
of
legislative
act
shall
be
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
is
it
your
view
that
the
congress
retains
jurisdiction
to
punish
former
members?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
the
congress
--
is
it
not
true
that
your
brief
recites
an
example
of
three
members
or
it
did
not
have
former
members
of
whom
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
were
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
he
did
in
fact
introduce
the
bill,
i
would
agree
with
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
solicitor
general
it
isn't
forbidden
by
the
district
court
order
either
is
it,
if
it's
a
future
--
if
you're
talking
about
the
future?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
i
understood
your
comment
a
moment
ago
you
said
a
letter
assumed
by
the
congressman
he
wrote
to
someone
said,
“if
you
give
me
x
dollars,
i
will
introduce
such
and
such
a
bill.”
and
you
said,
“that
would
be
reference
to
a
future
act
that
may
or
may
not
ever
be
performed.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
therefore
be
admissible
or
should
be
admissible
and
as
i
understand
it,
that's
admissible
under
the
district
court's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you
said
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
that
a
question
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
such
a
letter
be
admissible
if
it
said,
“you
will
recall
that
two
months
ago
you
gave
me
$500.00
and
i
introduced
such
and
such
a
bill
in
exchange
for
that.”
now
would
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
letter
be
admissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
do
not
offer
--
or
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted
in
the
letter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
let's
test
that
mr.
stavis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
congressman
is
called
before
a
grand
jury.
he's
alone
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
a
bunch
of
questions
are
asked
of
him,
but
that
all
of
which
pertain
to
legislative
acts,
he
could
answer
those
couldn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
he's
the
target?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
still
could
answer
them
if
he
decides
i
think
i'll
answer
these
questions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
for
waiving
his
cons
--
his
privilege,
you
say,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
