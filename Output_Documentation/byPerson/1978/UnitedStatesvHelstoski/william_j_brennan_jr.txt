justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
i
get
--
that's
a
case
in
controversy
argument,
but
did
i
understand
mr.
stavis,
you're
suggesting
that
even
though
you
did
not
cross-petition
on
the
question
of
the
appealability
of
the
order
to
the
third
circuit
that
it's
jurisdictional
and
therefore
that
we
can
reach
and
decide
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
be
clear,
that's
--
now
the
arguments
you're
now
making
is
really
a
case
of
controversy,
are
you
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
a
separate
argument
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
stavis,
what
took
--
you
said
congress
has
asserted
authority
to
try
after
his
defeat
which
i
gather
is
what
happened
to
this
congressman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
that
ever
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
against
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
he
can
never
be
tried
under
this
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
what
--
this
indictment
has
to
be
dismissed
is
your
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
he's
to
be
indicted,
he
has
to
be
indicted
by
a
new
grand
jury
which
does
not
hear
the
evidence
that
you
say
violates
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
that
is
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
even
if
he
had
voluntarily
submitted
all
this
material
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
regarding
his
legislative
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
even
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
any
more
than
two
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
any
more
than
two
litigants
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
challenge
the
indictments
mr.
brand
or
just
the
evidentiary
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
agree
with
mr.
stavis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
indeed
you
look
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
would
assert
that
even
if
he
appeared
and
answered
freely,
nevertheless.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
--
i
thought
your
position
was
so
far
does
that
principle
go
that
nothing
that
he
does
before
the
grand
jury
can
support
an
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing,
isn't
that
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
the
time
and
grand
jury
is
conducting
its
investigation,
it
presumably
doesn't
have
its
mind
made
up
what
its
going
to
do
at
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
does
it
have
to
stop
every
time
somebody
propose
and
introduced
in
the
--
before
it
a
legislative
act
and
decide
whether
or
not
it
can
be
received
based
on
what
its
ultimately
going
to
decide
with
respect
to
whom
it
may
indict?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
brand
is
there
any
instance
of
a
former
congressman
tried
by
the
congress
or
the
house
or
senate
for
a
conduct
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
some?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
an
incumbent
congressman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record,
mr.
brand,
tell
us
whether
the
congress
has
given
any
consideration
to
whether
any
action
should
be
taken
against
former
congressman
helstoski?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
gather
--
judge
meanor
said
you
could
not
be
--
use
the
evidence
of
bills,
private
bills
actually
being
introduced,
did
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
disagree,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
heard
when
and
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
it
refers
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
corresponds
--
suppose
--
as
i
read
some
of
this,
some
of
these
correspondents
says,
“i
did
this”
or
“i
didn't
do
that”
in
connection
with
the
given
private
bill.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
be
within
this
category?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it
refers
to
something
he
did
or
didn't
do
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
could
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
while
he
says
he
did
or
didn't
do
would've
been
a
legislative
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
if
--
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
exclusion,
i
introduced
the
private
bill
on
your
behalf
on
such
and
such
a
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
suppose
he
did
though?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
be
excluded
then
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
all
was
waivable
i
gather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
was
waivable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
be
sure
i
understand
your
--
you're
suggesting
in
substance,
as
i
understand
it
that
congress
can
waive
the
privilege
in
certain
limited
areas,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
they
pass
a
statute
that
says
members
may
be
questioned
about
banking
legislation
or
members
may
be
questioned
about
legislation
dealing
with
any
other
specific
subject
in
which
perhaps
a
minority
of
the
congress
might
be
vitally
interested
and
the
majority
might
not
be
interested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
can't
waive
in
that
situation
how
can
they
waive
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
if
you
--
they'd
have
a
non-legislative
act,
you
don't
need
the
waiver,
as
i
understand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
mr.
solicitor
general
that
the
government
thinks
it
has
a
case
even
without
the
materials
that
judge
meanor
sought
that
it
would
exclude
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
enough
to
get
to
the
jury.
