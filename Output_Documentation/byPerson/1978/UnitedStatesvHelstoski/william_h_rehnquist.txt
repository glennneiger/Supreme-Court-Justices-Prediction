justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stavis,
are
you
going
to
get
it
all
to
the
appealability
of
judge
meanor's
order
by
the
government?
i
noticed
that
you
attacked
it
in
the
third
circuit
but
neither
party
apparently
contest
it
here.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
is
not
open
and
shut
that
that
was
an
appealable
order.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
have
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
--
judgment
only
if
it
was
properly
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stavis,
would
the
net
result
of
accepting
your
theory
mean
that
congress
could
not
enact
and
the
president
sign
a
law
making
it
a
criminal
offense
for
a
congressman
to
take
a
bribe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
that's
like
calandra.
once
the
information
has
been
presented
to
the
grand
jury
there's
nothing
more
that
can
be
done
to
salvage
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
the
question
is
whether
the
indictment
it
returns
is
constitutional
or
not.
the
idea
that
if
you
present
a
different
information
to
another
grand
jury,
somehow
you
could
call
it
back
to
--
call
the
earlier
proceedings
back
just
isn't
possible.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
we
also
said
in
calandra
that
the
right
of
privacy
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
had
already
been
breached
and
there
was
nothing
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
he
may
not
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
now,
did
he
have
to
respond
to
anything
in
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
case
from
this
court
saying
that
an
indictment
returned
where
that
the
government
didn't
show
was
not
based
on
immunized
testimony
is
invalid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
--
could
you
ask
--
answer
yes
or
no?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
wouldn't
your
interest
be
served
by
according
to
congressman
a
right
to
assert
before
the
grand
jury
the
privilege
that
you're
talking
about
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
wouldn't
it
be
fully
served
and
if
he
chooses
not
to
assert
it,
then
there
is
some
form
of
waiver.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
was
the
questioning
before
the
grand
jury
which
violated
the
speech
and
debate
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
whom
were
the
questions
addressed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
why
couldn't
he
then
assert
the
speech
and
debate
privilege
and
fully
vindicate
it
by
asserting
it
at
that
point,
and
not
having
done
so,
he
has
waived
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
i
suggest
you
that
my
earlier
colloquy
with
mr.
stavis
is
not
entirely
irrelevant
to
some
of
the
questions
that
my
brother
have
been
asking
you.
this
is
a
very
hypothetical
situation
we're
presented
with
and
i
take
it
you
agree
that
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
exist
by
virtue
of
28
u.s.c.
1254
that
the
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
therefore
have
jurisdiction
to
review
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
only
way
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
was
pursuant
to
18
u.s.c.3731?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
government
could
come
in
and
on
its
own
without
the
defendant
making
any
motion
to
say,
“this
is
the
evidence
we're
going
to
present
at
trial,
we'd
like
the
trial
court
to
rule
on
whether
it
will
be
admissible
or
not.”
and
the
trial
court
divides
it
into
categories
and
said,
“this
will
be
admissible,
this
isn't.”
and
the
government
can
then
appeal,
say
that
court's
determination
that
certain
evidence
is
hearsay
and
were
therefore
be
inadmissible?
