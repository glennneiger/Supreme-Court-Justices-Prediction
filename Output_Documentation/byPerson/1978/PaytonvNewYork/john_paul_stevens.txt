justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
zimroth,
can
i
ask
you
what
your
view
of
the
laws
with
regard
to
this
kind
of
situation?
say
the
police
have
--
as
it
now
a
probable
cause
to
arrest
a
man.
they
go
to
his
home
and
ask
if
he's
home.
the
person
who
answers
the
door
says
no,
and
the
police
don't
believe
him.
can
they
bust
in
and
arrest
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
--
they
have
no
requirement
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
in
the
home?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
just
don't
know,
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
first
thing
they
do
they
want
to
pick
up
this
man
at
such
and
such
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
in
any
situation
would
the
warrant
requirement
help
or
hurt?
if
they
had
the
warrant
i
suppose
they
could
go
right
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
you're
concerned
about
then
is
not
the
probable
cause
to
arrest
showing
but
the
probable
cause
to
believe
he's
inside
the
premises,
which
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
presume
my
example
now
under
--
that
i
gave
you
before,
and
how
would
the
law
differ
depending
on
how
we
decide
this
case.
if
they
say
he's
not
here,
you're
saying
doesn't
really
matter
whether
they've
got
a
warrant
then.
if
they
say,
“yes
he
is
here”,
and
then
they
say,
“well,
we
would
like
to
seem
him
and
place
him
under
arrest”,
and
now
if
they
say,
“well,
you
--
then
he
kicks
out
the
backdoor,
i
presume
you
could
chase
him
because
it's
an
exigent
circumstance.”
you
do
the
same
thing
whether
you
have
a
warrant
or
not,
wouldn't
you?
how
does
it
--
whether
you
got
a
warrant
affect
anything?
in
this
situation,
you
go
to
the
door
you
say,
“i
want
to
see
so
and
so
because
i
want
to
place
him
under
arrest.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i'm
asking
you,
so
what
would
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
question
that
would
be
answered
by
deciding
what
are
exigent
circumstances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
might
agree
with
them
or
disagree
with
them
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
we
agreed
with
you
that
that
would
be
an
exigent
circumstance
if
they
knock
on
the
door,
they
say,
“we
want
to
arrest
him.
if
he
flees
at
that
moment
now
they
could
pursue
him.
if
that's
an
exigent
circumstance
and
then
you
don't
have
anything
to
worry
about,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
win.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
so
when
if
you
knock
on
the
door
and
he
says,
“yes,
he's
here”,
and
he
comes
out
and
you
arrest
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
so
if
he
either
--
if
he'd
runs
or
if
he
comes
out,
you
win
either
way,
now
when
do
you
lose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
they
must
arrest
him
even
if
they
know
even
if
--
they
would
believe
he's
not
guilty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
that's
very
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
so
is
a
search
warrant.
but
you
--
don't
you
mean
to
say
every
time
you
get
a
search
warrant
you
must
search
even
though
you
find
out
that
there
isn't
--
you're
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that's
true
of
any
arrest
situation,
you
judge
after
the
event
whether
there
was
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
and
in
fact
if
you
get
the
warrant
first
you'd
have
a
pretty
good
idea
whether
or
not
you
had
probable
cause.
it
seems
to
me
there's
more
of
an
after
the
fact
judgment
when
you
don't
have
a
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
only
if
they
want
to
make
the
arrest
in
a
home.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
surely
was
following
the
law
as
they
understood
it
when
they
searched
the
entire
premises,
were
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
mean
you
can't
say
they
were
all
following
the
law
as
they
understood
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
be
--
probably
repeating
but
it
seems
to
me
there'd
been
some
misunderstanding.
in
this
very
case,
talking
about
mr.
payton,
as
i
understand
the
sequence
of
events
they'd
learned
his
identity
at
one
time
and
his
name
at
another
time
and
his
address
at
another
time.
if
at
the
time
before
they
knew
his
address,
they
knew
his
identity
and
a
probable
cause
to
believe
he
was
responsible
for
the
offense
and
they
got
an
arrest
warrant
for
that
person
without
naming
an
address.
they
had
then
taken
that
warrant,
later
learned
his
address
and
broken
down
the
door
as
they
did
in
this
case.
would
you
concede
they
acted
within
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
with
no
address
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
think
there
may
be
a
constitutional
difference
between
a
warrant
that
includes
the
man's
address
and
one
that
does
not?
that's
the
delay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
otherwise
you
should
concede
that
because
you
have
conceded,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
if
the
warrant
includes
his
address
that's
all
that's
necessary.
they
don't
know
where
he
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
get
a
warrant
to
get
to
his
--
to
arrest
this
man.
they
know
where
he
lives.
they
go
out
the
first
place
they
look
is
in
his
home
and
nobody
answers
the
door
so
they
break
it
down.
you
say
that's
all
right,
but
it's
not
all
right
if
they
don't
know
his
address
before
they
get
the
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
saying
then
that
the
--
there's
a
constitutional
difference
depending
on
whether
they
get
his
address
in
the
warrant
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
take
that
position
you
are
really
agreeing
with
mr.
justice
white
that
you
want
some
kind
of
constitutional
protection
on
knowing
whether
he's
in
the
house
or
not,
and
that
would
be
more
like
a
search
warrant.
and
then
you're
going
to
say
the
time
you
go
in
to
get
the
warrant,
you
got
to
be
able
to
predict
whether
he'd
be
in
the
house
at
the
time
they
get
there
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
appeals
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
new
york
statutes
that
authorize
police
officers
to
enter
a
private
residence
without
a
warrant
and
with
force,
if
necessary,
to
make
a
routine
felony
arrest.
the
important
constitutional
question
presented
by
this
challenge
has
been
expressly
left
open
in
a
number
of
our
prior
opinions.
four
years
ago,
in
united
states
against
watson,
this
court
upheld
a
warrantless
"midday
public
arrest,"
expressly
noting
that
the
case
did
not
pose
"the
still
unsettled
question
whether
and
under
what
circumstances
an
officer
may
enter
a
suspect's
home
to
make
a
warrantless
arrest."
the
question
has
been
answered
in
different
ways
by
other
appellate
courts.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
rejected
the
constitutional
attack,
as
did
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
courts
of
last
resort
in
10
other
states,
however,
have
held
that
unless
special
circumstances
are
present,
warrantless
arrests
in
the
home
are
unconstitutional.
of
the
seven
united
states
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
the
question,
five
have
expressed
the
opinion
that
such
arrests
are
unconstitutional.
last
term
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
of
these
appeals
in
order
to
address
that
question.
after
hearing
oral
argument,
we
set
the
case
for
reargument
this
term.
we
now
reverse
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
made
applicable
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
the
police
from
making
a
warrantless
and
nonconsensual
entry
into
a
suspect's
home
in
order
to
make
a
routine
felony
arrest.
as
the
court
unanimously
reiterated
just
a
few
years
ago,
the
"physical
entry
of
the
home
is
the
chief
evil
against
which
the
wording
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
directed."
it
is
a
"basic
principle
of
fourth
amendment
law"
that
searches
and
seizures
inside
a
home
without
a
warrant
are
presumptively
unreasonable.
yet
it
is
also
well
settled
that
objects
such
as
weapons
or
contraband
found
in
a
public
place
may
be
seized
by
the
police
without
a
warrant.
the
seizure
of
property
in
plain
view
involves
no
invasion
of
privacy
and
is
presumptively
reasonable,
assuming
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
associate
the
property
with
criminal
activity.
as
the
late
judge
leventhal
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
recognized,
this
distinction
has
equal
force
when
the
seizure
of
a
person
is
involved.
any
differences
in
the
intrusiveness
of
entries
to
search
and
entries
to
arrest
are
merely
differences
of
degree
rather
than
kind.
the
two
intrusions
share
this
fundamental
characteristic:
the
breach
of
the
entrance
to
an
individual's
home.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
individual's
privacy
in
a
variety
of
settings.
in
none
is
the
zone
of
privacy
more
clearly
defined
than
when
bounded
by
the
unambiguous
physical
dimensions
of
an
individual's
home,
a
zone
that
finds
its
roots
in
clear
and
specific
constitutional
terms:
"the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
houses
hall
not
be
violated."
that
language
unequivocally
establishes
the
proposition
that
at
the
very
core
of
the
fourth
amendment
stands
the
right
of
a
man
to
retreat
into
his
home
and
there
be
free
from
unreasonable
government
intrusion.
in
terms
that
apply
equally
to
seizures
of
property
and
to
seizures
of
persons,
the
fourth
amendment
has
drawn
a
firm
line
at
the
entrance
to
the
house.
absent
exigent
circumstances,
that
threshold
may
not
reasonably
be
crossed
without
a
warrant.
for
these
reasons
and
for
additional
reasons
set
forth
in
a
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
remand
these
cases
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
