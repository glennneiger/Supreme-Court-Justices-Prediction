justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
walker
felt
that
way
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
use
the
term
entry,
mr.
hellerstein,
supposing
that
in
the
riddick
case
for
example
the
police
had
come
up
the
steps
onto
a
porch
and
the
door
had
been
open
and
hadn't
been
or
it
was
shut
and
then
opened
by
a
three
year
old,
and
simply
on
the
steps
they
had
seen
riddick
in
the
house,
in
the
room
and
in
bed
as
he
was,
would
that
be
an
entry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
--
but
what
again
if
you
have
the
door
open
and
the
people
simply
doing
whatever
they're
doing
in
the
front
room
with
obviously
no
intent
to
conceal
it.
the
windows
are
open,
the
door
is
open
anyone
walking
on
the
sidewalk
can
see
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it
isn't
just
resources
mr.
zimroth
is
it?
in
the
county
of
--
where
i
--
the
state
where
i
came
from,
there's
a
county,
coconino
which
has
20,000
sq/m
area.
massachusetts
has
an
area
of
9,000
sq/m,
just
a
transportation
problem
in
that
sized
county
is
going
to
be
very
substantial
if
the
only
magistrates
as
they
are
located
in
the
county
seat.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hellerstein,
i
think
your
colleague
was
asked
a
question
and
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
the
correct
situation,
is
it
your
contention
that
the
warrant
that
should've
been
had
here
but
was
not
should've
been
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
they
know
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
six
hours
in
advance
that
he
will
or
will
not
be
within
his
home?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
police,
they'd
had
a
warrant,
that
wouldn't
have
presented
--
prevented
them
from
arresting
the
latter
respondent
--
rather
latter
petitioner
in
his
underwear,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
heller
--
mr.
hellerstein,
earlier
in
your
argument
you
placed
great
stress
on
the
--
using
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire,
justice
stewart's
opinion
as
a
starting
point.
i
take
it
justice
harlan's
concurring
opinion
wasn't
necessary
to
make
that
a
majority
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
as
i
--
as
i
read
his
opinion,
he
starts
out
saying
from
the
several
opinions
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
it
is
apparent
that
the
law
of
search
and
seizure
is
due
for
an
overhauling,
that's
his
--
then
he
goes
on
and
says,
i
would
begin
this
process
of
reevaluation
by
overruling
mapp
against
ohio
and
ker
against
california.
now,
i
take
it
if
one
were
to
follow
justice
harlan's
views,
which
were
necessary
to
make
a
majority,
you
wouldn't
have
much
of
a
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
magistrate
ordinarily
focus
on
whose
home
other
than
his
own
the
person
might
be
in?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
our
watson
decision,
certainly
we
didn't
decide
that
on
the
basis
that
it
would
be
just
a
terrible
burden
on
the
police
to
go
get
a
warrant
to
arrest
a
man
in
a
public
place.
we
went
on
the
tradition
that
it
had
always
been
done
that
way,
and
that
is
what
the
constitution
must
have
meant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
miller
was
a
statutory
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
it
just
transfer
all
of
the
focus
of
the
suppression
hearing
from
the
grounds
from
the
--
for
the
warrant
to
whether
or
not
there
were
probable
cause
to
enter
the
home
though?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zimroth,
do
either
of
the
respondents
challenge
the
probable
cause
for
arrest
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
part
--
isn't
part
of
the
montage
or
whatever
you're
going
to
call
it,
of
argument
analogous
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
comment
in
the
earlier
case
that
perhaps
the
most
logical
thing
to
do
in
connection
with
the
fifth
amendment
is
to
ask
the
suspect,
did
you
do
it
or
not,
and
if
not
tell
us
where
you
were
and
so
forth?
it's
logical
but
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
it,
and
there
are
lot
of
things
in
the
constitution
that
are
prohibited
by
the
--
that
are
prohibited
that
perhaps
if
we
were
to
reexamine
them
today
we
wouldn't
necessarily
incorporate
by
the
same
token
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
by
the
same
token
it
derives
historical
antecedents
and
if
there
are
a
long
chain
of
historical
antecedents
perhaps
you
would
say
that
logically
one
situation
may
not
be
too
different
from
another,
but
it's
been
long
established
that
you
need
probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
a
gun
in
a
house
and
the
contrary
may
be
true
of
the
