mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
before
the
court
on
appeal
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
which
by
a
vote
of
four-to-three
sustained
the
former
and
present
new
york
arrest
statutes
which
allow
arrest
entries
even
in
the
absence
of
non-exigent
circumstances
into
the
home
and
permit
nonconsensual
and
forcible
entries
for
the
purpose
of
arrest.
two
cases
before
the
court
present
the
statutes
in
two
virtually
kind
of
apprehensive
applications.
in
the
payton
case,
you
have
the
forcible,
and
i
would
say
extremely
forcible
entry
without
a
warrant,
namely
the
breaking
down
of
mr.
payton's
door
with
crowbars.
in
the
riddick
case,
you
have
a
nonconsensual
but
an
entry
with
less
force
and
i
would
say
not
exactly
force,
namely
the
knocking
on
a
door,
the
opening
of
a
door
by
a
three
year
old
boy,
the
entry
to
arrest
and
the
placing
of
the
defendant,
who
was
in
bed,
under
arrest.
the
facts
leading
up
to
both
of
these
cases,
in
the
payton
case,
a
homicide
in
the
cause
of
robbery
had
been
committed
on
january
12,
1970
in
the
service
station
in
manhattan's
upper
east
side.
investigation
at
the
scene
led
to
the
discussion
of
investigating
officers
with
witnesses
to
two
days
later,
the
officer
learning
the
name
of
mr.
payton.
one
of
the
informants
or
people
who
spoke
with
the
officer
took
the
police
on
january
14,
two
days
after
the
crime,
sometime
in
the
afternoon.
took
the
officer
to
payton's
building
in
the
bronx
and
pointed
out
his
apartment
to
him.
that
detective,
detective
malfer,
the
investigating
detective
made
no
effort
at
that
time
to
arrest
the
defendant.
instead
he
came
back
and
the
following
morning
and
a
company
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
it
would
be
a
tougher
case
for
us
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
would
--
because
then
in
the
course
of
that
ongoing
situation,
it
might
be
argued
by
the
prosecution
that
the
circumstances
were
exigent
in
the
sense
that
at
the
very
first
moment
that
detective
malfer
learned
where
a
suspected
felon
for
which
he
had
probable
cause
lived,
he
might
then
have
possibly
consummated
the
arrest.
but
that's
not
what
happened
and
i
think
that's
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
judge
walker
was
the
only
judge
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
who
felt
that
way,
who
felt
that
this
--
and
it
was
a
continuous
pursuit.
i
would
submit
that
the
concept
continuous
pursuit
is
still
not
exactly
an
exigent
pursuit,
a
pursuit
in
exigent
circumstances.
but
i
don't
think
you
don't
even
have
to
agree
with
judge
walker.
i
think
that
the
concept
of
continuous
pursuit,
in
the
chief
justice'
question,
if
that
were
the
case
would
make
it
a
tougher
case.
i
would
not
necessarily
concede
to
the
circumstances
was
still
exigent,
but
that's
not
this
case.
the
fact
of
the
payton
case
is
that
not
having
done
that.
the
officers
--
the
officer
chose
to
wait
until
the
following
morning,
some
12,
14
hours
later.
when
accompanied
by
other
officers,
attempted
to
enter
payton's
apartment
and
not
being
able
to
do
so
still
took
additional
time
to
call
for
assistance
by
a
call
to
the
emergency
services
division
of
the
police
department
who
came
with
crowbars
and
broke
the
apartment
open,
the
door
of
the
apartment
open.
and
mr.
payton
was
not
there,
and
even
though
mr.
payton
was
not
there,
the
officers
ransacked
the
apartment,
searched
in
cupboards,
drawers,
closets,
under
the
mattress
knowing
he
was
not
there.
everything
that
was
found
was
suppressed
on
consent
by
the
district
attorney
because
it
was
of
course
illegally
seized
in
an
unlawful
search.
the
one
item
of
evidence
that
was
not
suppressed
was
a
.30
caliber
shell
casing
that
was
found
ostensibly
in
plain
view
by
detective
malfer
and
was
matched
shell
casings
found
in
the
scene
of
the
crime.
the
trial
court
and
ultimately
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
four-to-three
vote
sustained
the
admissibility
of
that
shell
casing
on
the
ground
that
the
officers
were
lawfully
on
the
premises
to
consummate
an
arrest
under
new
york's
then
code
of
criminal
procedure,
sections
177
and
178,
they
could
break
and
enter
without
a
warrant.
the
riddick
case
somewhat
different
in
the
sense
that
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
believe
mr.
riddick
had
committed
a
robbery.
in
1971,
they
had
probable
cause
at
least
two
months
before
they
went
to
his
apartment.
or
i
should
say
they
learned
his
address
two
months
before
they
went
to
his
apartment.
they
had
probable
cause
around
earlier.
the
arrest
in
riddick
was
extremely
typical.
no
great
hurry,
despite
what
the
prosecution
would
call
a
violent
crime.
they
knew
where
mr.
riddick
was
and
waited
two
months.
prosecution
concedes
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
negligent
about
the
riddick
case.
that
brings
before
the
court
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
majority
vote,
i
think
placed
its
emphasis
on
three
concepts
or
items.
the
first
that
an
arrest
entry
is
a
much
more
substantial
intrusion
than
an
entry
for
the
purpose
of
a
search
for
which
this
court
has
required
warrants
and
that
the
history
of
a
common
law
with
respect
to
arrest
entries
was
extremely
well
settled
and
clear
and
supported
the
court's
decision.
the
court
also
placed
an
emphasis
on
the
existence
of
statutes
similar
to
new
york's
and
many
states
and
upon
the
proposal
of
the
american
law
institute
not
recommending
a
warrant
be
obtained
in
these
particular
circumstances.
it
is
our
submission
that
the
court
erred
on
all
three
respects.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
less
intrusive.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
i'm
sorry
if
i'm
mistaken,
it
was
less
intrusive.
i
think
the
logical
starting
point
for
our
argument
must
be
the
plurality
opinion
of
this
court
in
coolidge
where
at
that
time
four
members
of
the
court
expressed
a
view
that
a
warrantless
entry
into
a
person's
home
to
arrest
was
at
odds
with
the
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
per
se
requirement
for
searches.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
it
would.
it
might
be
the
most
peaceable
entry,
but
it
would
definitely
be
an
entry.
i
think
they
would
have
had
to
obtain
permission
to
cross
the
threshold
and
come
into
mr.
riddick's
room.
i
think
the
views
expressed
in
coolidge
hopefully
will
be
able
to
support
the
conclusion
of
our
argument.
i
think
that
there
is
one
interest
that
has
predominated
this
court's
decisions
both
in
holding
and
in
dicta
as
i
read
them.
it
is
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
within
the
home
is
the
highest
of
its
kind
that
there
is
nothing
more
sanctified,
in
our
constitutional
system
both
historically
and
juridically,
and
that
the
privacy
of
the
home
is
paramount.
it
is
a
place
where
people
repair,
to
enjoy
in
their
utmost,
their
thoughts,
their
personal
feelings,
their
family
life
and
although
in
katz
the
court
spoke
of
the
fourth
amendment
of
protecting
people
not
places.
i
believe
that
was
supplemental
to
the
notion
that
the
home
is
a
place
where
the
privacy
interest
is
at
its
highest.
without
his
background
and
i'm
not
so
sure
that
the
prosecution
if
--
even
disagrees
with
what
i've
said
to
that
point.
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
erred
grievously
in
about
seven
different
respects
in
concluding
that
an
arrest
entry
was
less
substantial
than
one
for
purposes
of
the
search.
when
police
enter
private
premises,
that
entry
first
of
all
affects
everybody
in
the
premises,
there's
family,
children.
the
manner
of
the
entry
is
not
designed
to
ensure
the
privacy
of
the
people
within
or
to
minimize
the
intrusion
on
their
privacy.
i
think
we've
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
that
actual
manuals
by
recognized
experts,
police
conduct
and
practice
point
out
the
nature
of
the
way
that
entry
should
be
made.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
don't
know
how
common
that
would
be
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
if
the
problem
is
that
people
who
open
the
door
expose
what
is
within
to
the
--
open
eye,
they
are
responsible
for
minimizing
their
privacy,
but
that
might
be
impossible
with
respect
to
a
search.
but
to
arrest,
the
entry
is
the
key.
it
is
the
crossing
of
the
premises.
now
there
may
not
be
the
kind
of
intrusion
in
that
particular
situation
that
would
be
the
most
minimal,
but
there
is
nonetheless
the
intrusion,
also
the
police
may
still
enter
in
the
same
way
they
would've
if
they
had
to
go
to
the
door
and
knock
it
or
break
it
down
in
the
force
of
four
or
five
perhaps.
both
riddick
and
payton
exemplary
cases
of
more
than
one
officer
going,
they
might
still
enter
even
though
the
door
will
open,
fan
out,
conduct
the
protective
sweep
which
is
recommended
by
the
authorities
and
which
i
think
is
rather
a
common
place,
and
that
is
a
substantial
intrusion.
it's
a
substantial
intrusion
because
in
conducting
a
fan
out
or
a
protective
sweep,
there
is
immediately
open
to
view
of
the
police
whatever
items,
supposedly
personal
items
the
occupants
of
the
premises
have,
and
i
would
say
that
even
conducting
a
search
incident
to
that
arrest
is
nonetheless
a
search
of
a
good
deal
of
intensity.
the
search
of
a
person,
in
your
hypothetical
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
the
suspect
is
not
in
the
room
that's
open
to
view
and
even
though
the
entry
is
across
a
threshold
without
the
breaking
of
a
door,
but
the
suspect
say
is
in
a
backroom
or
in
the
warden
case
where
--
warden
versus
hayden,
where
the
court
saw
a
search
for
a
person
that
covered
a
multi-room
house.
that
can
be
also
an
extensive
search
for
a
person.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
stewart.
so
as
a
general
proposition,
i
think
the
intrusion
for
purposes
of
arrest
are
not
minimal
and
they
are
not
less
than
a
search.
in
fact
i
would
submit
that
there
are
occasions
when
an
entry
for
search
can
be
far
more
--
far
less
intrusive.
in
the
two
cases
before
the
court,
i
don't
think
you
can
conclude
that
there
was
a
minimal
intrusion
of
any
kind.
for
these
types
of
intrusions,
we
submit
that
a
warrant
should
be
required,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
interest
of
law
enforcements
to
preclude
or
to
cut
against
requiring
a
warrant
in
these
two
situations.
the
last
decision
of
this
court
dealt
with
the
subject
of
warrants
for
arrest
of
course
was
the
watson
case.
and
this
court
predicated
its
decision,
as
i
read
it,
for
dispensing
with
a
warrant
on
several
factors.
the
publicness
of
the
arrest
to
--
with
the
liberty
interest
was
not
so
substantial.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
majority
pointed
to
that.
but
in
this
case
or
these
cases
you
have
what
is
the
privacy
interest
as
well.
but
it
was
a
case
in
which
mr.
justice
powell
said
that
there
were
times
that
logic
must
refer
to
history
and
experience.
and
because
the
history
and
experience
of
the
common
law
with
respect
to
public
arrests
was
what
it
was
in
watson,
the
court
felt
that
warrant
should
not
be
required
for
non-exigent
public
--
for
any
public
arrests.
so
we
respectfully
submit
and
i
think
we've
try
to
in
great
length
in
our
brief
to
establish
that
the
common
law
with
respect
to
entries
into
the
home
to
arrest
without
a
warrant
was
a
bird
of
a
different
color.
in
fact
i
believe
the
court,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
miller
versus
united
states
pointed
first
citing
with
approval
judge
prettyman's
decision
in
accarino
versus
united
states
which
held
that
you
would
had
to
have
a
warrant
to
enter
but
as
a
minimal
proposition
pointed
out
to
the
disarray
among
the
common
law
sources
with
respect
to
entries
without
a
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
the
miller
case
was
under
3109
of
title
18,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
did
involve
the
issue
of
knocking,
announcing
that
--
but
in
the
course
of
the
court's
analysis
as
to
the
knock
and
announce
statute,
the
common
law
sources
with
respect
to
the
general
proposition
of
entry
without
warrants
was
examined
and
pointed
out
to
be
insubstantial
disarray.
in
that
disarray,
we
believe
it
does
not
afford
the
court
the
freedom
nor
should
it
to
conclude
that
the
watson
line
of
analysis
would
be
appropriate.
the
disarray
continued
beyond
the
common
law
into
the
19th
century.
and
of
course
a
number
of
stat
--
states
passed
statutes
similar
to
ours
not
requiring
warrants.
interestingly,
once
courts
begun
to
look
at
these
statutes
and
these
practices
under
fourth
amendment
principles,
the
predominant
overwhelming
weight
of
lower
court
judicial
authority,
state
and
federal,
has
been
to
require
warrants
in
non-error
--
non-exigent
circumstances.
the
second
circuit
in
united
states
against
reed
in
a
recent
decision
which
the
court
of
appeals
just
did
not
feel
it
should
follow
so
held,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
predominated
on
that
view.
the
warrant
requirement
in
the
context
of
entries
for
home
arrest
will
not
impose
any
substantial
legitimate
burden
of
law
enforcement.
if
the
circumstances
are
non-exigent
there
is
no
reason
for
law
officials
--
law
enforcement
officials
not
to
obtain
a
warrant.
the
basic
concern
of
the
prosecution
is
that
in
such
a
circumstance
the
requirement
to
obtain
a
warrant
will
preclude
catching
dangerous
criminals
quickly.
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
in
the
channel
opinion,
you
also
expressed
that
concern.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
as
i
believe
a
test
clause
report
which
is
cited
on
our
brief
of
--
with
respect
to
the
president's
commission
on
law
enforcement
initiation
of
justice,
establishes
that
50%
of
the
arrest
that
are
made
throughout
the
country
are
made
within
two
hours
of
the
crime,
45%
of
the
arrests,
the
remaining
45
are
made
a
day
after
the
crime.
that
conclusion
led
the
government
in
its
brief
in
santana
for
example
to
say
it
could
easily
live
with
a
requirement
of
two
hours
plus
for
a
warrant.
and
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
watson
case
itself,
it
pointed
out
that
the
fbi
as
a
practice
obtains
arrest
warrants
whenever
practicable
because
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
government
to
secure
a
warrant,
that
the
scrutiny
as
to
probable
cause
that
the
dangers
of
losing
evidence
because
of
suppression
are
minimized
by
obtaining
a
warrant.
we
submit
that
the
arguments
presented
by
the
prosecution
that
this
nonetheless
will
be
a
burden
on
law
enforcement
are
not
--
do
not
meet
the
actual
test.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
there
is
generally
as
i
understand
it
a
warrant
obtained
after
the
indictment.
that's
the
only
way
in
the
present
law
in
new
york.
now,
it
looks
like
this
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
a
document
that
says
warrant
of
arrest,
a
bench
warrant
or
warrant,
and
this
--
it
--
this
is
issued
after
an
accusatory
instrument.
this
would
be
the
supreme
court
warrant
on
a
felony
case.
this
would
be
a
criminal
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
pardon
me?
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
or
an
information,
yes,
but
under

william

prosecuted
information
of
complaint.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
not
necessarily.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
not
necessarily.
in
the
sense
that
i
have
been
informed
that
its
been
my
experience
at
times
police
will
go
and
get
an
arrest
warrant
occasionally.
but
they
of
course
have
to
have
an
accusatory
instrument,
so
they'll
go
to
the
complaint
room
in
and
say
in
new
york
or
manhattan
have
the
complaint
drawn
up,
district
attorney
will
accompany
the
police
officer
up
to
the
bench
and
arraign
in
part
and
get
an
arrest
warrant
based
on
that
accusatory
instrument,
piece
of
paper
like
that.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
but
under
new
york
law
it
must
be
an
accusatory
instrument.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
what
determines
that
is
really
the
judgment
of
the
police
and
most
often
has
not
obtained
a
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
officer
--
departmental
procedures,
there
are
no
particular
guidelines
and
it
is
rare,
certainly
in
this
context
for
a
warrant
to
be
obtained
on
the
basis
of
--
i
should
say
rare.
it's
not
the
practice
as
i'm
informed
but
perhaps
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
sometimes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
just
a
few
things
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
zimroth
is
simply
wrong,
i
believe,
when
he
tells
you
clear
out
that
there
is
a
probable
cause
requirement
for
believing
that
a
person
who
is
sought
to
be
arrested
in
the
home
must
be
in
that
home.
there
is
no
such
probable
cause
requirement
that
he
is
at
that
moment
in
the
home.
our
statute
simply
requires
a
reason
of
belief
that
he
is
at
home.
and
if
you
know
that
the
man
works
at
night
and
you
go
to
his
home
at
four
in
the
morning
with
a
warrant
or
without
a
warrant,
you
know
he's
not
going
to
be
home
and
that
is
i
think
what
we're
talking
about.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
he
has
to
in
the
supporting
affidavit.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that
--
oh
no,
he
doesn't
have
to
say
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
he's
in
the
home.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
no,
no.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
then
the
warrant
simply
states
the
address
of
the
defendant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
and
that
can
be
arrest
for
any
kind.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
warrant
for
any
kind
of
an
arrest,
whether
it's
within
the
home
or
on
the
street.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
he
must
have
a
reason
to
believe.
he
does
not
have
to
show
that
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
he's
at
home
at
that
moment.
and
if
you
know
the
man's
address,
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
that
he
will
be
home,
unless
you
have
facts
to
the
contrary
as
i
tried
to
indicate.
i
think
that's
how
the
courts
have
dealt
with
that.
there
is
a
ninth
circuit
case,
i
think
the
philips
case
was
decided
by
this
attorney
which
i
think
is
a
rare
case.
i
think
the
general
case,
doorman,
some
arizona
cases
that
have
dealt
with
the
issue
say
you
do
not
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
in
his
home
at
that
moment.
i
think
one
of
the
main
concerns
in
the
area
of
entering
premises
is
when
you're
dealing
with
third
person
premises.
namely,
that
you
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
defendant
is
in
somebody
else's
home
or
is
not
his
property.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
an
arrest
warrant,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
it
need
not
have.
it
simply
should've
been
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
--
as
a
predicate
for
an
arrest
within
the
home,
in
other
words
supporting
papers
i
think.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that
is
my
submission.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
reason
to
belief
--to
believe
--
a
reason
to
believe
to
conclude
the
defendant
is
at
home
when
he
is
obtaining
a
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
nor
to
obtain
the
warrant
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
with
respect
to
a
warrantless
arrest.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
with
respect
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
it
says
that
he
must
have
reason
to
believe
--
reason
of
belief
that
he's
at
home.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
section
140
--
15,
arrest
without
a
warrant
may
enter
premises
in
which
he
reasonably
believes
such
person
to
be
present,
that's
without
a
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
same
thing
as
probable
cause
to
believe
the
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
mr.
justice
and
that
is
the
statute
1280
which
follows
that
that
has
the
same
language.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
absolutely,
that's
crucial
that
a
magistrate
not
the
officer
should
make
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
to
protect?
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
oh,
yes!
in
fact
the
decision
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
the
man
has
committed
a
crime
is
decision
that
is
made
upon
a
showing
to
a
magistrate.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
oh,
yes
it
will.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
it
will
require
a
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
and
that
a
magistrate
makes
that
determination
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
that's
covered.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
absolutely.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
and
a
concern
that
the
police
won't
know
where
the
defendant
is,
i'm
saying
if
they
face
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
--
they're
going
to
go
to
his
home
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
the
first
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
not
so
in
the
riddick
case,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
let
me
--
there're
two
other
things
that
i
wanted
to
spell.
the
notion
of
this
burden
of
time,
at
least
in
urban
areas,
it
is
not
correct
that
it
takes
six
hours
to
get
a
warrant
in
new
york
county.
we've
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
one
case
where
it
was
two
hours
for
a
search
warrant.
of
course
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
the
time,
but
i
simply
submit
that
six
hours
is
not
an
accurate
statement.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
with
respect
to
rural
areas,
i
also
submit
that
perhaps
the
time
in
obtaining
a
warrant
might
be
relevant
to
an
assessment
as
to
whether
the
warrant
was
required.
but
i
think
that
would
have
to
depend
upon
the
situation
in
that
rural
county.
i
also
don't
know
that
this
court
would
hold
a
magistrate,
pure
magistrate
need
issue
the
warrant
under
shadow
and
the
city
of
tampa,
it
might
find
something
less,
i
don't
know.
now,
third
fact
that
mr.
zimroth
tells
you
was
that
once
a
warrant
would
be
obtained,
the
police
officer
would
have
no
alternative
even
though
he
now
knew
the
fellow
was
innocent
but
to
execute
that
warrant.
that
simply
is
not
the
case.
there
is
no
reason
he
cannot
countermand
that
warrant
under
the
federal
rules
of
current
procedure
rule
4
(b)
(4)
or
(5).
a
magistrate
is
authorized
to
cancel
any
unexecuted
warrants
upon
request
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
i
think
the
process
would
be
the
same.
if
an
officer
says
that
“gee,
the
fellow
i
got
the
warrant
for,
i
now
know
he's
innocent,
we
don't
have
to
arrest
him.”
and
called
the
district
attorney
and
say,
“we've
made
our
mistake.
have
them
--
have
the
warrant
vitiated.”
there's
no
--
i
just
think
that
that's
not
so.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
first
of
all,
i
know
new
york
has
a
lot
of
crime.
i
don't
know
that
even
30,000
warrants
in
the
context
of
this
case
would
be
an
accurate
figure.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
do
respect
i
would
think
it
might
be
high
insofar
as
we're
talking
about
arrest
within
the
home
that
are
made
on
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
we
are
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
we're
only
asking
that
the
warrant
requirement
be
imposed
for
arrest
within
the
home
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
addressed
in
a
dwelling
in
non-exigent
circumstances.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
he
can
do
that
without
a
warrant,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
oh,
no!
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
oh,
no
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
absolutely
not.
i'm
saying
that
the
arrest
--
not
at
all,
i'm
suggesting
that
--
that
in
fact
that's
lang
versus
gailstiene
i
believe
in
the
fourth
circuit.
that
i'm
saying
with
a
warrant
to
arrest,
you
must
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
committed
a
crime
and
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
he's
in
the
premises
where
you're
going
and
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
that's
by
statute.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
was
going
to
an
assumption
this
be
would
be
inserted
into
new
york
statute
of
law.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
it
requires
an
--
a
determination
of
probable
cause
as
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
to
arrest
the
person.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
wherever
found,
but
only
if
he's
in
his
home
is
a
warrant
required.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
you
do
not
require
a
warrant
for
the
public
way.
if
you
know
you're
going
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
if
they
must
inform
the
magistrate
that
it
is
to
be
within
the
home.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
that
why
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
they
can
anticipate.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
it
must
say
in
the
supporting
papers
that
we
are
seeking
a
warrant
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
then
i
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
then
i
must
clarify
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
by
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
not
arrest
warrants,
no
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
i
think
--
if
you're
thinking
about
bench
warrants
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
those
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
--
those
are
essentially
bench
warrants
which
are
issued
for
suspects.
in
new
york
city
the
high
statistics
is
not
the
unexecuted
arrest
warrant,
it's
the
unexecuted
bench
warrant
where
there's
been
an
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
after
an
accusatory
instrument.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
but
with
respect
to
--
i
think
if
the
officer
intends
to
make
an
arrest
within
the
home,
he
must
come
before
the
magistrate
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
--
so
stating
and
that
he
must
have
established
on
the
papers
that
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
--
that
the
defendant
has
committed
a
crime
and
that
he
has
reason
to
belief
--
to
believe
that
he
is
in
his
home.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
i
think
he
has
to
have
--
there
has
to
be
a
connection
between
going
to
the
home.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
probable
cause?
in
the
sense
of
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
reason
for
believe,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
under
our
present
system,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
i
don't
know
in
the
constitution,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
he
has
to
determine
on
the
application
before
him,
papers
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
it
would
depend
what
the
warrant
would
say.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
--
my
submission
is
that
it
state
that
in
time
the
warrant
was
obtained,
there
were
two
things,
probable
cause
for
the
crime
and
reason
for
belief
that
he
is
at
home.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
like
that.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
they
can
do
that
under
watson.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i'm
sorry
if
i've
confused
you
mr.
justice,
i
thought
that
was
what
my
adversary
was
saying.
i
say
the
federal
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
--
constitution
requires
only
probable
cause
to
believe
commission
of
the
crime
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
--
in
order
to
enter
the
house.
not
that
it
requires
that
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
it's
a
protection
of
the
house
insofar
as
the
arrest
is
to
be
made
there.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that
would
depend
what
kind
of
a
warrant
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
would
say
not
necessarily
if
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
under
the
federal
constitution,
i
do
not
think.
i
think
there
have
to
be
a
premises
identified.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
if
that
was
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
if
this
court
had
held
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
if
this
court
had
held
that
the
warrant
was
required
so
far
as
the
probable
cause
to
believe
commission
of
the
crime,
i
think
it
would
be
sufficient,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
and
then
the
officers
locating
the
premises
could
go
in
without
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
there
are
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
there
are
john
doe
warrants
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
neither
have
i.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
i
think
--
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
the
warrant
had
to
be
obtained
in
order
for
there
to
be
an
arrest
within
the
home.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that
is
my
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
if
they
had
the
arrest
warrant?
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
would
be
reluctant
to
concede
that
mr.
justice
stevens,
because
i've
had
no
experience
with
that
context.
i
think
that
i
might
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
mainly
because
the
warrant
had
been
obtained
by
a
magistrate
who
had
made
the
determination
that
there
was
new
probable
cause.
and
once
the
determination
was
made
by
a
magistrate
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
don't
think
there
was
a
difference.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that's
right.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
what
the
constitution
required
a
warrant
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
--
it
should
have
the
man's
address
in
it.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i'm
not
certain
of
that
though.
i'm
not
certain
that
is
--
i
think
the
key
thing
is
that
the
warrant
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
that's
not
what
i'm
after.
i'm
after
the
determination
that
a
magistrate
makes
with
respect
to
prior
--
to
going
to
the
home.
i
don't
know
what
the
experience
would
be
or
in
the
constitution
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
mr.
justice,
i
can
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
after
the
court's
decision
in
watson,
i
can
urge
that.
what
i'm
saying
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
it'd
be
a
while
but
i
believe
that
watson
says
is
not
required.
what
i'm
trying
simply
to
say
is
that
a
warrant
to
enter
the
home
is
required
beyond
watson.
that
is
--
i'm
not
seeking
a
warrant
for
arrest.
i'm
seeking
for
a
warrant
for
arrest
within
the
home.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
states
it
far
too
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
i'm
simply
saying
that
there
can
be
an
arrest
--
there
can
be
no
arrest
within
the
home
without
a
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
an
office?
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
office
and
the
extent
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
just
in
the
continuum
of
this
court's
--
that's
not
this
case.
this
court
has
another
decisions,
afforded
offices
some
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment
depending
on
what
the
expectations
of
privacy
were,
who
had
access
to
the
office.
i
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
an
office
that
was
open
to
the
public
to
do
business
was
not
in
any
way
like
the
home.
and
if
that's
not
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
the
interior
of
my
office
where
i
might
work
alone
would
have
the
same
privacy
of
the
home,
but
not
necessarily
where
i
see
clients
and
do
business.
that
would
be
i
would
draw
the
line.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i'd
be
most
happy
to
leave
them
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
will
do
that.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
before
you
on
reargument.
they
are
appeals
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
by
a
vote
of
four-to-three
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
new
york's
arrest
statutes
which
allow,
even
in
the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances,
a
warrantless
entry
into
the
home
for
the
purposes
of
arrest.
to
briefly
state
the
facts
which
i
think
in
both
cases
are
manifestations
of
the
operations
of
the
statute,
that
in
real
terms
demonstrate
the
importance
of
the
warrant
requirement
which
i
think
this
court
will
require
or
should
require.
in
the
payton
case,
you
had
a
situation
where
on
january
12,
1970
there
was
a
homicide
in
the
course
of
a
robbery
on
an
upper
east
side
gas
station
in
new
york
city.
two
days
later,
the
police
--
the
investigating
police
obtained
information
as
to
who
they
could
believe
was
probable
cause
may
have
committed
the
crime.
that
information
led
them
that
day
to
go
to
the
premises
--
to
have
the
premises
pointed
out
to
them
and
to
do
nothing,
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
afternoon,
the
entire
evening,
until
7:30
the
next
morning
when
in
a
substantially
large
group
of
detectives,
they
went
to
the
premises,
an
apartment
on
the
fifth
floor
in
a
building
in
the
south
bronx
--
in
manhattan,
i'm
sorry.
and
after
trying
to
force
the
door
open
and
unable
to
do
so,
called
for
assistance
which
arrived
a
half
hour
later
and
with
the
use
of
crowbars
the
door
was
forced
open.
once
the
police
entered
the
premises
and
they
saw
that
mr.
payton
was
not
even
there,
they
proceeded
to
ransack
the
apartment,
seized
a
number
of
items
which
--
all
of
which
was
suppressed
by
the
trial
court
on
consent
on
the
prosecution
except
for
a
30
caliber
cartridge
that
was
found
in
plain
view
on
top
of
a
stereo
set.
the
lower
courts
and
the
majority
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
finding
that
the
police
were
lawfully
in
the
premises
since
they
did
not
need
a
warrant,
could
have
seized
what
they
saw
in
plain
view.
the
riddick
case
is
another
--
more
striking
in
some
respects
example
of
the
essentiality
of
a
warrant
requirement.
in
riddick,
the
crime
was
committed
four
years
prior
to
the
arrest.
the
police
have
probable
cause
and
could've
known
and
could've
gotten
mr.
riddick
a
long
time
before
they
went
to
his
apartment.
they
waited
two
months
before
they
decided
to
arrest
him
in
his
apartment
without
a
warrant,
even
though
they
knew
his
address.
they
went
in,
his
three-year-old
son
answered
the
door,
they
entered,
mr.
riddick
was
sitting
in
his
bed
with
some
underwear
on
but
naked
to
the
waist,
and
he
was
arrested.
i
think
the
entries
in
both
of
these
cases
are
cardinal
examples
of
why
as
i
understand
where
this
court
has
gone
so
far
with
respect
to
warrants,
the
warrant
requirement
should
and
must
be
imposed
with
respect
to
entries
in
non-exigent
circumstances
into
private
premises.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
--
they
didn't
arrest
him
in
his
underwear.
i
mean,
they
let
him
get
dressed
to
leave.
i
just
--
the
reason
i
emphasized
factually
underwear
is
we're
talking
about
the
home
and
these
are
--
this
is
the
heart
of
privacy.
and
in
order
to
enter
a
home
and
to
seize
citizens
in
that
context
i
think,
as
i
understand
the
warrant
requirement,
it
has
always
been
to
ensure
that
a
magistrate
has
determined
that
before
that
type
of
entry
is
made
the
probable
cause
determination
should
be
made
by
someone
other
than
a
police
officer
who
has
to
make
subjective
judgments
that
are
not
always
correct.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
excuse
me.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
oh,
yes,
i
would,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
depending
on
the
expectation
of
privacy
because
that
--
the
residents
of
that
motel
room
would
have.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
that
the
court
has
said
quite
clearly
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people,
not
places.
but
people
in
the
context
of
where
their
expectation
of
privacy
is
of
the
highest
and
we
would
draw
no
distinction
with
respect
to
motels
and
homes
but
the
actual
residence,
and
i
think
a
motel
room
can
be
a
home
for
--
the
time
and
person
who's
there,
but
there
would
be
no
distinction.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
mr.
payton
was
not
--
he
turned
himself
in.
he
was
not
home
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
--
when
the
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
and
riddick.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
in
payton,
it
was
a
multiple
tenement,
multiple
dwelling
tenement,
fifth
floor,
apartment
5-a.
i've
not
seen
the
premises
but
i
think
it's
a
typical
new
york,
manhattan
tenement.
in
riddick,
it
was
a
two-family
private
house
in
queens.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
half
a
house.
the
majority
below
approached
the
case
along
the
lines
that
an
entry
to
arrest
was
less
intrusive
than
an
entry
to
search.
that
was
its
first
premise.
its
second
premise
was
that
an
arrest
in
the
home
is
less
embarrassing
than
an
arrest
in
public
and
therefore
this
court's
concern
in
watson
was
even
less
forceful.
i
--
for
reasons
i'll
state,
i
disagree
with
both.
and
again,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
common
law
was
very
one-sided
in
terms
of
trying
to
ascertain
the
intent
of
the
framers
that
it
was
one-sided,
that
the
common
law
allowed
entries.
i
submit,
i
think
in
our
brief
extensively
we
come
to
quite
an
opposite
conclusion.
so
we
think
these
assumptions
were
wrong,
erroneous.
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
since
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
a
number
of
courts,
high
appellate
courts
have
refused
to
follow
it,
i
think
because
it's
a
bitter
pill
for
a
lot
of
courts
to
follow,
a
warrantless
entry
of
this
kind.
and
the
eighth
circuit
has
just
recently,
in
the
houle
case,
which
is
in
our
supplemental
brief,
refused
to
allow
warrantless
entries
and
the
high
courts
of
wisconsin
and
pennsylvania
also
refused
to
follow
the
payton
case
as
decided
by
the
majority.
there's
some
significance
i
think
in
at
least
the
sensitivity
of
a
number
of
courts
both
state
and
federal
to
the
issue.
our
basic
line,
basic
view
is
that
if
one
thing
is
clear
about
this
court's
decision
is
--
is
it
that
physical
entry
of
the
home
is
the
chief
evil
against
which
the
fourth
amendment
stands
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
and
the
arrest
warrant
provides
protection
at
the
very
least
against
that
type
of
entry
without
a
magistrate
determination
that
on
the
facts
known
to
the
officer
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
a
defendant
has
committed
a
crime.
i
think
for
us
the
logical
starting
point
for
our
argument
has
to
be
the
plurality
opinion
in
the
coolidge
case,
where
the
court
said
that
the
notion
of
a
warrant
was
entry
to
arrest
was
per
se
at
odds
unreasonable
in
line
of
the
court's
decisions
and
absent
well-defined
exigent
circumstances
there
could
be
no
warrantless
entry.
and
further
than
the
coolidge
case,
the
court
said
that
warden
versus
hayden,
which
has
come
to
be
known
as
a
"hot
pursuit"
type
of
case,
stands
by
which
negative
implication
that
an
arrest
warrant
is
required.
these
two
statements
of
the
plurality
in
coolidge
have
led
most
if
not
all,
but
a
substantial
and
predominant
number
of
courts
to
read
the
language
in
coolidge
to
come
to
a
conclusion
quite
opposite
that
reached
by
the
majority
below.
and
we
think
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
quite
opposite
than
that
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
which
is
that
a
warrant
is
required.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that
i
think,
mr.
justice
white,
is
a
little
more
difficult
question
than
the
issue
of
where
there's
a
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
most
courts
have
held
that
an
arrest
warrant.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
united
states
versus
prescott,
has
said
we
don't
care
what
you
call
it
as
long
as
it
has
two
things.
it
requires
a
determination
by
the
magistrate
as
to
entry
of
premises
as
well
as
probable
cause
for
a
crime.
but
most
courts
either
gloss
over
what
type
of
warrant
or
specifically
say
an
arrest
warrant.
the
second
circuit
which
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
not
that
he's
in
the
house.
that
is
the
determination
when
it's
an
arrest
warrant,
that
when
the
warrant
is
being
executed
by
the
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
the
ninth
circuit
requires
a
warrant
that
requires
the
magistrate
to
do
both.
a
number
of
other
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
merely
a
search
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
my
position
is
that
maximally
a
search
warrant
would
make
the
most
sense
in
terms
of
the
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
minimally
an
arrest
warrant
plus
reasonable
cause
when
that
warrant
is
executed
by
the
officer
that
believed
that
the
defendant
is
in
the
premises.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no,
the
ninth
circuit
would
go
a
little
bit
more,
and
i
would
be
glad
to
have
it,
but
i
would
take
the
position
that
i
think
at
least
touched
upon
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
dalia
case
in
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
dalia
v.
united
states,
the
surreptitious
entry
case,
where
mr.
justice
powell,
writing
for
the
court,
specifically
noted
that
an
arrest
warrant,
first
of
all,
was
not
a
useful
document.
secondly,
that
a
magistrate
cannot
always
focus
on
every
aspect
of
the
privacy
intrusion
but
that
the
important
thing
is
that
there's
an
arrest
warrant
in
the
officer's
hand.
now,
as
far
as
i
see
it
in
a
case
such
as
this,
where
no
warrant
at
all
is
required
as
a
predicate
for
entry,
at
the
very
least
the
fourth
amendment
should
require
and
does
require
an
arrest
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think,
yes.
i
think
there
is
a
--
i
don't
recall
if
they
specifically
talk
about
the
second
aspect,
but
i
would
say
would
be
fair
to
guess
that
even
a
court
such
as
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
which
does
not
require
a
warrant,
would
say
that
even
though
you're
going
with
probable
cause
on
the
crime,
you
also
have
to
believe
that
the
fellow
was
on
the
premises.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
the
new
york
--
that
issue
did
not
come
up
in
terms
of
these
cases.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
so
i
would
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
for
the
crime.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
information
as
to
both
--
both
officers.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
that
the
officers
had
they
gotten
a
warrant
would
have
--
if
it
was
an
arrest
warrant,
would
have
had
probable
cause
in
both
cases
to
execute
that
warrant.
and
i
think
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
and
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
guess
it
would
depend
upon
the
composition
of
the
court
at
the
current
time,
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
--
and
i
don't
presume
to
speak
for
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
considerations
which
he
spoke
to
in
those
cases
were
his
views
of
federalism
in
the
role
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
know
that
you
for
one
do
share
perhaps
with
respect
to
mapp
at
least
that
view.
but
i
don't
--
i
think
also
that
mr.
justice
harlan
was
--
was
extremely
sensitive
as
he
said
in
jones,
too,
forcible
entries
into
the
home
to
make
an
arrest,
and
said
that
a
grave
constitutional
question
was
presented
by
that
issue
which
is
the
issue
we
have
here.
the
approach
which
the
court
of
appeals
below
took
in
the
majority
opinion
by
judge
jones
really
i
think
denigrated
or
underestimated
tremendously
the
nature
of
an
arrest
entry.
i
mean,
to
be
able
for
the
court
--
for
the
court
to
be
able
to
say
that
an
arrest
entry,
it
was
less
intrusive
than
a
search
entry,
just
doesn't
square
factually
with
the
--
what
we
know
about
arrest
entries
or
in
fact,
the
facts
of
this
case.
first
of
all,
when
a
police
enter
a
dwelling,
as
they
did
in
these
cases,
they're
affecting
the
privacy
of
all
of
the
people
where
there
may
be
more
than
just
the
defendant.
but
the
manner
of
the
entry
is
not
designed
to
safeguard
the
privacy
interest
and
to
minimize
it.
we
have
in
our
brief
cited
manuals,
standard
operating
manuals
of
what
police
are
supposed
to
do
when
they
go
into
premises
to
arrest
for
a
felony,
they
protect
themselves
that
are
fanned
out,
engage
in
protective
sweeps.
that's
--
that's
pretty
intrusive
and
can
be
very
often
much
more
intrusive
than
a
search
which
if
you
find
the
item
or
items
that
are
specified
in
the
search
warrant
can
be
very
unobtrusive.
the
entire
premises
are
open
to
scrutiny,
items
that
people
hold
dear
to
them
that
are
private,
have
nothing
to
do
with
whatever
they're
being
sought
for,
or
can
be
seen
by
officers.
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
can
be
very
intrusive.
on
the
other
hand,
a
search
can
be
minimal.
there
was
nothing
minimal
about
the
entries
in
these
two
cases.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
chimel.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
but
i
think
what's
important
is
the
point
that
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
you
have
that
--
i
think
that's
the
point
that
chief
judge
cooke
was
trying
to
make
his
--
in
his
dissent.
and
i
think
there's
some
value
in
it.
he
said
if
the
officers
here
had
an
arrest
warrant,
they
would've
known
in
payton
that
they
were
going
to
arrest
payton.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
they
wouldn't
--
not
have
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
what
they
plan
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that's
correct.
but
i
think
it
was
--
it
was
sort
of
a
--
in
a
way
a
psychological
point
that
the
chief
judge
was
making
and
that
is
the
warrant
itself
has
a
value
of
limiting,
telling
the
officers
a
directive
that
when
you
are
--
you
have
this
fellow,
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
he's
committed
a
crime,
you
go
and
arrest
him,
that's
all
you
are
supposed
to
be
doing.
and
we're
not
going
to
leave
it
to
the
--
you
know,
suppression
at
a
trial
to
take
care
of
everything
else
you
ransacked
the
place
for.
that
i
think
was
the
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
i'm
not
saying
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
if
they're
lawfully
there.
our
position
is
that
in
this
case
they
were
not
lawfully
there
without
a
warrant.
and
as
i
stated
earlier,
as
i
see
it,
the
minimum
requirement
is
for
an
arrest
warrant,
if
what
this
court
albeit
in
plurality
or
even
in
the
majority
in
the
dalia
case
have
given
meaning
to
an
arrest
warrant,
then
that
is
the
kind
of
warrant
that
should
be
required
and
is
required
with
respect
to
arrest
entries.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
there
i
think,
at
least
in
terms
of
the
way
scholarly
discussion
has
gone,
in
some
circuits,
such
as
the
third
circuit,
there
is
a
greater
concern
that
in
that
situation
particularly,
perhaps
only
a
search
warrant
will
do
the
job
because
--
of
the
concern
is
that
there
the
magistrate
is
not
even
focusing
on
the
person
whose
premises
it
is.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
to
get
into
that
in
this
case.
this
is
--
these
two
cases
involve
arrest
entries,
of
premises
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
not
in
an
arrest
warrant
context.
he
would
if
it
were
--
if
he
were
required
to
get
a
search
warrant.
the
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
some
courts
have
so
held
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
some
courts
have
so
held
that
again
and
i
think
the
logic
for
it
would
be
that
it
still
requires,
once
you
have
the
valid
arrest
warrant,
judgment
left
in
the
officer
under
an
arrest
warrant
that
the
person
is
in
the
premises
sought
must
be
based
upon
probable
cause.
i
don't
think
that's
an
optimum
solution.
i
want
to
make
myself
clear.
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
and
the
issues
presented,
i
don't
think
i've
got
to
convince
you
that
you
need
go
further.
i
--
i
should
point
out
that
the
court
has
amended
rule
41
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
provide
for
search
warrants,
not
arrest
warrants,
when
persons
are
being
sought,
without
limiting
it
to
third
person
premises.
i
can
only
say
that
there's
logic
to
that
amendment.
it
would
be
wrong
for
me
to
say
anything
other
than
that.
but
furthermore,
that
if
the
court
had
a
desire
to
harmonize
rule
41
which
at
least
you
at
times
said
implemented
fourth
amendment
concerns,
then
the
most
sensible
reconciliation
of
this
difficult
issue
would
be
to
require
a
search
warrant
so
that
rule
41
would
totally
conform
with
what
the
fourth
amendment
requires,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
for
this
case.
the
prosecution
--
my
adversary,
mr.
zimroth
talks
a
great
deal
about
the
burdens
to
police
if
you
impose
either
type
of
requirement.
i
know
that
in
the
warrant
context
you
heard
that
argument
many
times
and
you've
rejected
it
many
times.
and
you've
rejected
it
many
times
because
you
placed
the
importance
of
that
warrant
requirement
in
our
constitutional
scheme
in
a
very
high
level.
and
when
you
combine
that
with
the
home,
the
premises,
parts
of
the
home,
i
think
the
prosecution
has
--
should
have
an
insurmountable
burden
in
terms
of
policy
arguments.
if
we
start
with
the
premise
that
we're
talking
non-exigent
circumstances,
then
i
can
see
no
weight
at
all
to
mr.
zimroth's
argument
that
a
warrant
requirement
imposed
by
this
court
would
be
a
burden
to
any
legitimate
concern
of
police
officers.
because
if
it's
not
exigent,
circumstances
are
not
exigent,
then
the
police
have
time
to
do
a
number
of
things.
and
i
think
these
two
cases
pointed
out
--
in
riddick
they
had
an
awful
lot
of
time
to
take
a
slight
detour
and
get
an
arrest
warrant.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
in
watson
you
must
have
felt
yourself
freer
to
do
it
based
on
the
fairly
one-sided,
almost
exclusively
so,
history
of
the
common
law
with
respect
to
arrest
issues.
that
is
not
so
with
respect
to
going
to
homes
to
make
arrests.
i
think
that
at
the
very
least,
and
i
think
the
court
in
miller
v.
united
states
a
long
time
ago,
1957,
pointed
out
that
the
law
with
respect
to
arrest
entries
into
the
home
was
not
letter
clear.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
that
was
section
3109.
but
in
a
footnote,
mr.
justice
brennan
writing
for
the
court
acknowledged
--
first
of
all,
he
pointed
to
judge
prettyman's
opinion
in
the
accarino
case
which
judge
prettyman
i
think
makes
a
very
substantial
brief
that
the
common
law
was
very
one-sided
our
way.
and
if
i
had
to
argue
that
i
would,
but
i
don't
think
that
what
was
available
to
the
court
in
watson,
the
clarity
of
the
common
law
going
the
other
way,
can
possibly
be
available
here,
and
it's
not.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that
was
with
respect
to
knock
and
announce
and
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
--
knocked
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
purpose
and
authority,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
the
court
was
quite
clear
in
miller
that
that
was
a
very
important
intent
meant
by
congress
in
3109,
but
what
was
not
before
the
court
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
the
court
did
not
hold
in
miller,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
was
construing
the
constitution
in
terms
of
knock
and
announce.it
was
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
that
may
well
be.
it
may
well
be.
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
the
question
of
being
able
to
enter
without
a
warrant
was
not
presented.
the
prosecution
in
closing
out
its
brief,
i
don't
think
the
arguments
of
a
rush
to
get
the
warrant
if
we're
not
talking
about
exigent
circumstances
can
be
very
substantial.
it
talks
about
such
things
as
the
rubber
stamp,
that
if
you
hold
a
warrant
is
required
for
felony
arrest
within
the
home
in
this
case,
the
magistrate
is
going
to
begin
to
rubber
stamp
these
things.
i
think
that
is
entirely
out
of
sync.
it's
not
synchronized
with
what
this
court
feels
about
the
role
of
magistrates
and
the
importance
of
the
independent
judgment
of
the
magistrate.
another
argument
that
the
prosecution
makes
is
that
if
you
require
a
warrant,
i
call
it
the
irrevocable
arrest
of
the
innocent
argument,
which
mr.
zimroth
puts
forth,
that
once
a
warrant
is
issued
it
must
be
executed,
that
if
an
officer
gets
a
warrant
that
says
you
are
directed
to
bring
to
the
court
this
fellow,
he
must
do
so,
but
that
is
not
true.
it's
not
true
under
the
new
york
law.
it's
not
true
under
any
law
that
i
know.
if
--
if
an
officer
gets
information
that
undercuts
the
basis
for
that
warrant,
he
isn't
obligated
to
go
and
arrest
an
innocent
man.
the
--
there
are
two
arguments
that
the
prosecution
makes
that
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
he's
authorized.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes,
but
he
doesn't
have
to
do
it.
he
can
cancel
it.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
it's
a
process.
the
last
two
arguments
which
mr.
zimroth
makes
is
that
if
you
require
a
warrant
you're
going
to
reduce
the
scope
of
suppression
hearings
because
there'll
be
less
for
us
defense
lawyers
to
do.
and
to
that
--
tied
to
that
is
the
reduction
of
possible
damage
suits
against
officers
because
they
now
have
warrants.
i
should
have
thought
of
those
arguments.
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
in
my
brief.
but
those
seem
to
be
exactly
the
kinds
of
arguments
that
should
come
as
a
logical
consequence
of
the
warrant
requirement
should
be
a
desirable
outcome.
why
should
we
have
to
have
extensive
suppression
hearings
based
on
who
did
what
and
whom,
and
what
if
there
is
a
warrant
that
a
magistrate
passed
upon?
more
importantly,
why
should
police
have
to
be
at
their
peril
with
respect
to
making
these
judgments?
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
--
i
--
it's
been
my
experience
that
hearings
which
are
directed
to
controverting
warrants,
and
my
experience
has
been
greater
in
the
search
warrant
area,
are
much
more
limited,
namely
they
really
go
to
the
--
whether
it's
perjury
in
the
underlying
affidavits.
they
do
not
rehash
all
of
the
factual
determinations
which
were
presented
to
the
magistrate
unless
there's
a
--
i
think
this
court
has
so
held
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
but
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
these
are
policy
arguments
and
simply
do
not
support
the
source
from
which
they
come
is
my
only
point.
that
being
the
case,
i'd
say
none
of
the
policy
arguments
are
worth
this
court
declining
to
follow
the
logic
of
its
prior
decisions
and
to
hold
that
a
warrant
is
required
in
non-exigent
circumstances
for
an
arrest
in
the
home.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
have
nothing
further,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
oh,
not
at
all.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
first
of
all,
just
to
answer
that,
mr.
zimroth
is
talking
within
the
context
of
our
existing
statutory
framework
that
says
because
we
only
give
you
warrants
when
you
commence
a
prosecution,
you
have
to
see
the
prosecutor.
but
that's
what
this
case
--
this
case
is
about,
we
are
police
officers,
can
get
warrants
without
having
to
see
the
prosecutor
as
they
do
in
those
jurisdictions
so
we
can.
that's
a
critical
difference.
