mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
community,
the
societal
interest
that's
at
stake
in
this
case,
and
this
case
is
enormous.
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
simply
gathering
evidence
but
bringing
the
defendant
to
court
so
that
the
civilizing
processes
of
law
can
even
be
brought
to
bear
on
that
case.
this
is,
i
believe,
one
of
the
first
requirements
of
any
civilized
society,
the
alternative
to
which
is
vigilante
justice.
this
fundamental
interest
that
is
to
have
a
court
bring
the
processive
law
to
bear
has
been
recognized
throughout
history.
and
that
is
why
the
judgment
has
been
made
throughout
history
that
it
is
better
not
to
impose
a
lawyerized
process
before
the
arrest
and
that's
regardless
of
where
the
arrest
takes
place,
but
rather
that
it
is
better
first
to
obtain
custody
of
the
defendant.
and
then
to
construct
a
system
whereby
the
defendant
is
given
all
the
processes
he
is
due.
and
it
is
a
very
elaborate
system.
the
defendant
must
be
brought
to
court
immediately
after
arrest.
the
continued
custody
--
his
continued
custody
is
tested
immediately.
eventually,
his
guilt
of
innocence
is
tested.
and
also,
in
this
process
there
is
a
review
of
the
arrest
process
itself.
we
are
not
here
suggesting
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
nothing
to
--
says
nothing
about
the
arrest
process.
of
course
it
says
a
lot
about
the
arrest
process.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
think
what
it
says
is
that
you
have
to
show
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest
and
also
although
this
court
has
not
stated
this
is
a
constitutional
matter,
nonetheless
most
states
in
the
common
law
history
suggest
that
if
this
is
going
to
be
a
forcible
entry
the
courts
will,
after
the
defendant
is
in
custody,
determine
whether
or
not
the
police
made
every
--
an
attempt,
the
proper
attempt
to
avoid
the
necessity
for
the
forcible
entry
that
is
by
knocking
and
announcing
their
authority.
and
if
the
police
behave
unlawfully
very,
very
severe
consequences
attach
to
that.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
i
think
that
there
might
be
special
concerns
in
certain
areas,
that
is
if
it
were
a
nighttime
arrest,
i
think
it
might
be
a
special
situation
or
if
it
were
an
arrest
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
is
conceivable
though
no
court
has
so
held,
or
the
court
has
not
held,
this
court
has
not
held.
it's
conceivable
that
in
no
circumstances
this
court
might
impose
a
warrant
requirement
because
if
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
right.
i'm
saying
that
is
conceivable
that
it
--
all
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
--
is
that
this
case
doesn't
present
that
question
of
nighttime
arrests.
i
agree,
that
is
the
question,
the
question
in
this
case
is,
is
it
a
warrant
required.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
by
saying
a
warrant
is
not
required
if
the
court
so
holds
that
that
is
not
the
same
saying
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply,
that
there
are
other
protections
that
the
fourth
amendment
imposes
on
this
situation.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
right,
and
very
severe
consequences.
also
the
exclusionary
rule
for
one
and
tort
actions
for
another.
and
i'm
suggesting
that
this
is
a
debate
that
is
that
mr.
hellerstein
and
i
are
having
that
has
been
a
debate
throughout
history.
that
is
exactly
the
same
terms
of
the
debate.
that
is
the
privacy
of
the
home
as
opposed
--
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
tremendous
public
interest
in
bringing
a
suspected
felon
upon
which
--
about
whom
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
committed
a
felony
to
justice.
and
the
judgment
of
history
which
i
think
is
relevant
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
constitution
requires
a
warrant
has
been
uniform
in
this
respect.
no
prior
judicial
screening
has
been
required.
mr.
hellerstein
says
it
is
a
big
dispute
at
the
common
law
and
i
think
he's
making
it
understandable
but
nonetheless
apparent
error
in
that
respect.
and
that
is
that
there
were
disputes
about
what
sort
of
showing
the
police
officer
had
to
make
after
the
arrest.
some
of
the
common
law
authority
said
that
all
you
had
to
do
is
show
probable
cause
in
order
to
relieve
yourself
of
liability.
others
said
that
you
have
to
show
that
a
felony
had
actually
been
committed.
and
a
few
said
that
you
had
to
show
that
the
defendant
was
actually
guilty,
but
none
of
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
would
depend
on
the
case
your
honor,
or
i
might
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
would
have
to
say
that
in
the
circumstances
of
the
payton
case,
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
entry
because
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
which
is
why
i
think
the
balance
is
a
little
different
in
that
--
in
the
nighttime
entry
than
it
is
in
a
daytime
entry.
i
should
say
that
the
judgment
that
i'm
talking
about,
about
the
reasonableness
of
entering
without
a
warrant
is
not
only
uniform
throughout
history,
but
it
is
the
judgment
made
in
most
states
today.
there
are
36
states
that
have
statutes
on
this
subject
and
30
of
them
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
has
--
it
has
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
they're
up
until
relatively
recently,
until
the
court's
dictum
in
coolidge.
and
what
happened
after
coolidge
is
that
many
courts
in
effect
reserved
on
the
issue.
they've
said
that,
“we
assume
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
a
warrant
would
be
required
but
we
find
exigent
circumstances.”
not
all
the
courts
say
that
but
many
of
the
ones
cited
by
mr.
hellerstein.
there
is
not
a
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
a
basic
ambiguity
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
most
of
the
courts,
all
but
one
i
think,
has
--
that
have
held
that
they
needed
to
be
--
a
warrant
say
that
there
need
to
be
only
an
arrest
warrant.
i
think
there's
an
ambiguity
there
and
the
difficulty.
this
court
has
already
said
that
in
watson
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
your
honor
but
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
your
honor
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
mr.
hellerstein
blindly
assumes
that
there
would
be
no
serious
practical
consequences
if
this
court
imposes
a
warrant
requirement.
the
basic
problem
with
the
warrant
requirement
is
that
it
--
in
essence
that
it
imposes
a
review
mechanism
on
a
situation
that
in,
it
grows,
in
most
cases
or
in
many
cases
is
very
fluid
and
very
volatile.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
first
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
if
i
may
say
so
your
honor,
he
earlier
this
morning,
he
criticized
the
police
in
the
payton
case
for
not
in
effect
getting
a
warrant
after
the
building
was
pointed
out
to
them.
and
i
think
if
there
were
a
warrant
requirement
there
would
be
a
pressure
on
them
to
get
a
warrant
at
that
time.
now,
you
might
ask
why
didn't
they
get
a
warrant
at
that
time
assuming
that
there
had
been
a
warrant
requirement.
at
that
time,
first
of
all,
they
did
not
know
that
the
defendant
was
there.
his
building
have
been
pointed
out
to
him
but
they
also
had
information
someone
had
told
the
police
that
the
defendant
said
he
was
going
somewhere.
more
important
than
that,
they
did
not
know
what
mr.
payton
looked
like
and
they
did
not
have
his
correct
name.
isn't
it
better
for
them
to
do
what
they
in
fact
did
do?
they
took
this
witness
back
to
the
station
house,
they
talked
to
him
for
a
considerable
length
of
time,
they
got
photo
arrays,
they
got
pictures
and
the
witness
eventually
pointed
out
mr.
payton's
photograph
later
in
the
evening.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
an
illustration
of
what
will
happen
if
there
is
a
warrant
requirement.
it
will
pressure
the
police
to
solidify
their
decisions
before
it
is
appropriate
to
do
so.
the
exigent
circumstances
exception
that
mr.
hellerstein
says
will
solve
all
these
problems
will
not
solve
the
problems.
and
the
reason
it
won't
solve
the
problems
are
because
the
exigent
circumstances
exceptions
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
they
knew
the
name
--
they
knew
the
correct
name.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
they
did
not
have
--
they
did
not
know
--
they
knew
his
address
but
they
didn't
know
he
was
home.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
the
warrant
didn't
say
he
was
home,
but
the
point
is
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
but
the
point
is
shouldn't
we
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
wouldn't
stop
him
from
getting
a
warrant,
but
isn't
it
better
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
it
would.
the
way
it
would
inconvenience
them
is
that
instead
of
doing
further
investigation,
they
would
have
to
divert
their
resources
and
go
get
a
warrant.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
getting
a
warrant
is
not
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
the
federal
authorities
in
the
campbell
case
estimated
about
six
hours
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
in
new
york
city,
about
six
hours
to
get
a
warrant.
now
it's
not
only
a
question
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
includes
manhattan
where
this
crime
occurred.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
in
united
states
against
campbell,
a
second
circuit
case
where
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
testimony
of,
i
think
it
was
an
fbi
agent.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
no
sir
there
are
not.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
don't
know
about
never
but
there
were
not
in
1970
and
they
were
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
there
are
not.
there
weren't
then
and
there
aren't
now.
it's
sort
of
interesting.
the
assumption
is
that
getting
a
warrant
is
a
very
easy
affair.
it's
not
an
easy
affair.
you
have
to
worry
about
first
of
all
you
call
the
district
attorney
and
you
review
the
case
with
him.
the
courts
in
new
york
as
in
many
other
jurisdictions,
you
can't
get
a
warrant
until
you
actually
initiate
a
criminal
proceeding.
so
you
review
the
case
with
the
assistant
district
attorney.
you
have
to
worry
about
typists.
you
have
to
worry
about
transportation.
you
have
to
worry
about
court
stenographers.
six
hours
is
a
long
time,
and
the
other
point
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
there's
no
evidence
here
because
there
was
no
warrant
requirement
here.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
would
suggest
it
would
take
long
to
hear
than
it
would
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
i
would
say
though
that
if
you
compare
the
federal
system
and
the
state
system,
it
raises
another
problem
and
that
is
the
problem
of
resources.
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
supposing
warrant
requirement
not
on
the
fbi
or
the
dea
or
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
but
upon
approximately
more
than
20,000
police
departments
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
absolutely
your
honor,
and
the
reason
i
mentioned
the
number
of
police
departments
is
not
only
because
it's
a
question
of
resources,
but
it's
a
question
of
different
problems
in
different
areas.
we're
dealing
with
50
states
in
all
these
different
police
departments,
some
rural
counties,
some
urban
counties
with
some
have
more
resources
some
have
fewer
resources.
some
police
departments
have
one
member,
and
some
investigations
may
have
only
one
person
on
it.
if
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
if
--
if
that's
true
--
i'm
not
aware
of
that
being
here
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--
but
if
it's
true
that
is
a
very
--
it
is
a
very
serious
problem.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
then
it's
a
very
serious
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
the
problem
in
that
respect.
and
the
important
thing
is
that
we're
standing
here
after
the
event.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
true,
but
it
still
takes
a
substantial
period
of
time,
and
the
more
important
factor
than
that
your
honor,
is
that
it
seem
to
be
unfair
to
judge
a
warrant
requirement
after
everything
has
solidified
that's
why
the
question
about
the
indictments
is
not
a
fair
question,
because
when
an
indictment
issue
all
of
the
evidence
has
been
gathered
and
it
is
presented
to
a
body.
we're
talking
about
imposing
a
warrant
requirement
in
the
on
going
investigative
stages.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
they
are
true
about
the
search
warrant
there
are
two
--
there
are
several
very
important
differences.
the
first
is
the
difference
of
numbers.
in
new
york
county
last
year,
there
were
approximately
500
search
warrants
issued
in
new
york
county.
there
were
30,000
felony
arrests
in
new
york
county.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
your
honor.
but
the
important
point
is
that
the
police
will
not
know
in
advance
whether
they're
going
to
find
the
defendant
in
his
home
or
not.
anytime
that
the
arrest
is
substantially
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
itself,
the
police
--
the
home
is
naturally
a
logical
place
to
check,
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
under
warrant
requirement
they
will
have
to
get
that.
mr.
hellerstein
cites
a
study
which
we
also
cite
in
our
brief
which
indicates
that
about
half
of
the
felony
arrests
are
made
more
than
two
or
three
hours
after
the
commission
of
the
crime.
so
we're
talking
about
potentially
a
universe
of
15,000
cases,
not
three
or
400
cases.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
under
the
present
law,
yes
they
can.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
oh,
i'm
sorry,
if
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
oh,
no
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
they
cannot.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
the
warrant
would
be,
in
my
judgment,
invalid
--
i
mean
the
warrant
would
be
valid
but
the
arrest
would
still
be
illegal
because
it
seems
to
me
that
regardless
of
the
warrant
requirement
the
police
need
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
is
in
his
home
before
they
can,
or
in
a
given
location,
before
they
can
bust
in.
and
the
warrant
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
they're
not.
they
don't
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
right
but
it
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
if
you
pick
him
up
in
his
--
in
a
dwelling
you
need
probable
cause
to
believe
he's
in
there,
that's
by
statute
in
new
york.
and
i
also
believe
it
is
and
should
be
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
that
is
the
mere
existence
of
the
arrest
warrant
without
probable
cause
does
not
justify
going
in
to
a
residence.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
i'm
concerned
about
imposing
the
requirement
in
advance
of
an
arrest
warrant
that
is
having
the
--
the
police
have
to
in
all
these
thousands
of
cases
go
to
a
magistrate
to
have
them
review
the
probable
cause
to
get
an
arrest
warrant
in
order
for
them
to
go
into
a
home.
mr.
hellerstein
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
in
that
case,
it
depends
--
what
mr.
hellerstein
would
say
is
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
i
know
but
you're
asking
me
what
practical
consequences
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--
the
rule
would
have.
if
there
were
an
arrest
warrant
ruled
and
the
police
had
had
some
opportunity
in
advance
to
get
an
arrest
warrant.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
think
mr.
hellerstein
would
say
that
the
fact
that
exigent
circumstances
arose
at
that
time
would
not
be
sufficient
that
they
could've
foreseen
this
possibility
and
they
should've
gotten
an
arrest
warrant.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
and
that
is
what
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
and
that
is
the
difficult
point
here
your
honor
is
that
the
police
have
to
know
in
advance
what
a
court
two,
three,
in
this
case
nine
years
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
you
have
something
to
worry
about
in
that
--
if
the
court
imposes
--
in
that
particular
case,
we
would
win
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--
i
agree.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
in
that
particular
case
we
would
win,
but
the
arrest
warrant
require
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
true.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
we
lose
because
if
there's
an
arrest
warrant
requirement
the
police
in
the
course
of
their
investigation
will
not
know
whether
--
they
would
not
know
what's
going
to
happen
at
the
door.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
those
are
only
two
possibilities
of
things
that
might
happen
at
the
door.
another
thing
that
might
happen
at
the
door
is
that
they
might
find
--
get
information
that
the
person
whom
they're
looking
for
is
not
in
fact
guilty.
if
they
had
previously
had
to
get
an
arrest
warrant,
presumably
they
would
end
up
having
to
arrest
him.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
advance
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
if
--
well,
it
depends
on
how
strong
the
proof
is.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
but
an
arrest
warrant
is
a
command.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
but
the
realities
in
the
situation
are
that
the
police
and
--
i
overstated
by
saying
that
they
know
he's
not
guilty.
they
may
have
some
doubts
in
their
mind
instead
of
allowing
them
to
do
further
investigation.
the
arrest
warrant
requirement
will
pressure
them,
will
be
an
additional
pressure
for
them
to
make
the
arrest.
the
point
is
that
any
exigent
circumstances
exception
is
bound
to
be
quite
unclear.
if
you
look
what's
happening
in
the
various
states
that's
exactly
what's
happening.
in
some
states
like
in
california,
there's
an
exigent
circumstances
exception
that's
applied
so
strictly
that
if
the
police
wait
literally
ten
minutes
before
they
go
in
and
make
the
arrest,
then
the
court
say
they
should've
gotten
a
warrant.
that's
the
people
against
ellers
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
in
other
jurisdictions,
these
exigent
circumstances
exception
really
distorts
what
we
ordinarily
think
of
it,
the
exception
out
of
all
proportion
and
that
also
is
a
very
unhealthy
situation.
it's
an
unhealthy
situation
because
it
doesn't
give
any
guidance
to
the
police.
and
it's
an
unhealthy
situation
because
eventually
those
cases
may
influence
the
exigent
circumstance
exception
in
the
search
area
which
would
be
very
unfortunate.
i
think
that
the
basic
point
that
i
want
to
make
here
is
that
you
can
always
think
of
situations
in
cases
where
there
are
--
where
you
could
say,
“well,
the
police
should
have
time
to
get
a
warrant
or
they
didn't
have
time
to
get
a
warrant.”
but
all
of
those
are
going
to
be
situations
in
which
we
are
sitting
after
the
event
judging
what
is
already
transpired
and
not
situations
where
the
police
have
to
engage
on
ongoing
investigation.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
and
that's
what
i
think
should
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
but
you
don't
require
the
police
to
--
in
a
sense,
in
the
midst
of
their
investigation
review
the
evidence
before
they
make
the
arrest.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
but
they're
not
going
to
know
in
advance
whether
they're
going
to
be
in
the
home,
whether
the
defendant
is
going
to
be
in
the
home.
so
that
the
requirement
is
going
to
have
more
effect
than
simply
arrest
that
are
made
in
the
home.
and
i
think
that
its
--
if
these
kinds
of
problems
which
are
very
difficult
to
get
your
hands
on
because
the
investigations
are
by
their
nature
of
an
infinite
variety.
it's
this
very
reason
i
think
that
until
coolidge
there
has
been
a
uniform
judgment
not
to
impose
an
arrest
warrant
requirement
on
the
police.
and
the
people
who
came
to
that
conclusion
were
not
people
who
were
insensitive
to
the
concerns
of
privacy
in
the
home.
they
were
the
very
same
people
who
created
the
protections
which
later
became
the
protections
embodied
in
the
fourth
amendment.
i'd
--
i
have
--
i
see
i
only
have
a
few
more
minutes
and
i
did
want
to
--
the
mention
of
coolidge
brings
me
really
to
the
second
point
in
the
case.
and
that
is
until
coolidge
was
decided
there
was
very
little
if
anything
which
could've
given
the
police
in
the
payton
case
any
reason
for
going
to
get
a
warrant.
there
was
a
state
statute
at
the
time
which
authorized
them
to
enter
without
a
warrant.
what
--
even
if
what
conceivable
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
served
if
now
nine
years
after
that
event
this
court
excludes
the
evidence
that
they
found
upon
entry.
they
were
following
the
law
as
they
understood
it,
and
the
way
they
understood
it
is
exactly
the
way
almost
every
single
--
everybody
else
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
and
they'd
pay
the
price
for
that
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
but
we're
not
judging
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
say
we
paid
the
price.
i
should've
said
we
paid
the
price.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
and
it
was
a
very
substantial
price,
i
should
say,
that
that
is
at
the
--
what
was
suppressed
on
the
prosecutor's
concession
before
the
hearing
below
were
photographs
of
the
defendant
in
the
ski
mask
when
--
and
that
was
the
evidence
at
the
trial
that
he
went
in
with
a
ski
mask.
and
i
should
say
mr.
justice
stevens
that
i'm
not
condoning
the
police
conduct
for
searching,
and
in
fact
the
--
my
office
conceded
the
illegality
of
that
search.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
my
point
was
that
in
terms
of
the
breaking
down
of
the
door,
there
was
absolutely
nothing
illegal
about
that
at
the
time.
it
was
the
generally
accepted
practice
in
most
of
the
states.
it
had
been
based
on
a
very
long
history.
these
police
officers,
in
respect
to
the
entry,
were
following
what
they
thought
was
the
law
and
which
if
they
had
called
up
a
district
attorney
or
their
supervisor,
that
person
would've
told
them
it's
the
law
too.
and
in
fact
if
they
had
gone
and
got
or
tried
to
get
a
warrant,
in
all
likelihood
the
judge
would've
said,
“what
are
you
doing
here?
you
don't
need
a
warrant.
the
statute
doesn't
require
a
warrant.
this
is
the
accepted
practice
in
most
of
the
states.
there's
no
substantial
constitutional
issue
that
is
raised.”
what
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
served?
i
think
myself
that
the
exclusion
--
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
demeaned
in
a
sense
if
this
evidence
was
suppressed
because
you
are
in
effect
telling
the
police
that
it
doesn't
matter
that
they
make
an
effort
to
follow
the
law
of
the
state
legislature
as
they
understand
it
and
as
it
is
understood
at
that
time.
if
there
are
no
questions
then
i
am
finished.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
hellerstein
is
asking
this
court
to
--
in
a
very
drastic
manner
change
the
balance
of
accommodating
interests
that
have
been
with
us
from
the
earliest
of
recorded
history
on
this
subject
until
relatively
recently.
the
accepted
manner
in
which
the
lawfulness
of
an
entry
to
a
home
to
make
an
arrest
for
a
felony
was
quite
clear,
and
that
is
that
the
officers
brought
the
defendant
into
custody
and
then
the
judicial
system
mobilized
in
a
very
substantial
manner
to
test
two
things,
first
the
factual
predicate
for
the
arrest,
and,
second,
the
manner
of
execution
of
the
arrest.
this
was
a
judgment
of
people
who
were
very
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
privacy.
in
fact
these
very
same
people
created
the
protections
that
subsequently
became
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
respect
to
search
warrants.
and
in
fact,
this
system
that
i
have
outlined,
if
i
may
borrow
the
words
of
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
gerstein
against
pugh
case,
where
he
said
there
are
indications
that
the
framers
of
the
bill
of
rights
regarded
it,
meaning
this
system
that
i've
just
outlined,
as
the
model
of
a
reasonable
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
hellerstein
i
think
is
simply
incorrect
when
he
says
that
there
was
a
substantial
dispute
about
this
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment.
there
were
many
disputes
about
the
manner
in
which
the
lawfulness
of
arrests
were
to
be
tested,
but
those
disputes
were
about
the
standards
to
be
applied
in
the
litigation
after
the
defendant
was
brought
into
custody
and
not
disputes
about
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
magistrate
interposed
in
the
on-going
system
of
--
the
on-going
investigation.
the
entire
--
the
common
law
authorities
and
the
framers
of
the
fourth
amendment
recognized
that
this
was
an
accommodation
of
competing
interests.
it
was
a
substantial
protection
against
illegal
arrest
in
the
home
and
elsewhere.
there
was
an
additional
protection
of
--
against
illegal
arrests
in
the
home
by
the
requirement
that
the
officers
knock
and
announce
their
authority
as
mr.
chief
justice
mentioned
earlier
which
is
now
law
in
most
states,
in
many
states
by
statute,
and
the
purpose
was
to
minimize
the
need
for
force,
to
give
the
people
inside
the
ability
to
submit
peacefully
to
the
authority
of
the
officer,
but
again
these
standards
were
tested
in
litigation
after
the
defendant
or
the
suspect
was
brought
into
custody.
the
entire
burden
i
think
of
mr.
hellerstein's
argument
is
that
we
have
a
search
warrant
requirement
and
therefore
we
must
have
an
arrest
warrant
requirement.
and
if
i
may
summarize
the
many
reasons
i
think
that
those
two
powers
and
warrants
are
vastly
different
before
i
get
into
the
argument.
in
the
first
place,
the
community
--
the
community's
interests
are
vastly
different
in
the
two
kinds
of
powers.
the
effect
on
the
law
enforcement
functions
are
vastly
different.
and,
thirdly,
the
search
power
is
much
more
extensive
and
more
intrusive
than
the
arrest
power
and
the
need
for
a
warrant
requirement
is
much
greater.
these
are
the
very
reasons
why
the
two
powers
have
been
treated
differently
for
so
much
of
our
history.
mr.
hellerstein
says
that
there
will
be
no
burden
on
law
enforcement
if
you
interpose
a
magistrate
before
the
arrest.
this
court
has
examined
that
argument
twice
relatively
recently,
once
in
gerstein
against
pugh,
where
mr.
justice
powell
called
this
an
intolerable
handicap
for
legitimate
law
enforcement.
that
characterization
was
repeated
in
watson
both
by
the
majority
and
then
by
mr.
justice
powell
in
concurrence
again
where
he
said
that
the
interposition
of
a
magistrate
will
"severely
hamper
effective
law
enforcement,"
and
in
fact
it
would
severely
hamper
effective
law
enforcement.
any
warrant
requirement
will
have
to
be
seen
from
the
perspective
of
the
police
officers
who
are
going
--
going
to
have
to
live
with
this
requirement.
just
as
an
example,
where
mr.
hellerstein
criticizes
the
police
in
payton
for
not
getting
a
warrant
after
the
afternoon
of
january
the
14th.
he
says
that
they
knew
the
name
of
the
defendant
and
that
they
knew
--
they
looked
at
his
building
and
he
says
they
did
nothing.
he
says
they
did
nothing
after
that
until
the
next
morning.
well,
that's
simply
untrue.
what
they
were
doing
is
further
investigation,
and
it's
the
kind
of
investigation
that
should
be
fostered
by
this
court,
and
the
police
should
not
be
diverted
from
that
kind
of
investigation
in
order
to
go
get
a
warrant
which
would
be
a
very
time-consuming
process.
in
fact,
what
they
were
doing
was
trying
to
put
together
a
photo
array
so
that
they
could
know
what
the
defendant
looks
like
and
also
what
they
were
doing
is
to
try
to
find
out
where
the
defendant
was.
knowing
where
the
defendant's
apartment
is,
is
very
different
from
knowing
where
the
defendant
is.
here,
we
have
a
defendant
who
two
days
earlier
shot
and
killed
the
manager
of
a
gas
station
and
on
that
same
night
he
goes
to
his
friend
and
admits
to
the
friend
that
he
did
it
and
also
tells
the
friend
that
he
is
going
"somewhere."
this
is
the
same
defendant
who
must
have
known
that
two,
perhaps
three
people
in
the
gas
station
knew
this
defendant.
it
seems
to
me
knowing
the
defendant's
address
in
a
circumstance
like
that
is,
as
i
say,
very
different
from
knowing
where
he
is
at
any
particular
moment.
and
it
also
seems
to
me
that
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
situation
in
which
the
police
should
be
encouraged
to
do
further
investigation
and
should
not
be
diverted
from
that
investigation
by
the
very
time-consuming
process
in
which
a
warrant
would
be.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
this
particular
case,
since
there
was
no
warrant
requirement,
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
however,
in
a
case
in
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
figure
it
would
take
be
a
very
substantial
amount
of
time.
can
i
go
through
for
you
what
steps
would
have
to
--
the
police
would
have
to
do
to
get
a
warrant
so
you
could
see
how
substantial
it
would
be?
the
first
thing
the
police
would
have
to
do
from
the
moment
they
decide,
well,
now
is
the
time
we
have
to
get
a
warrant,
is
they
would
have
to
gather
together
all
the
facts.
now,
in
this
particular
investigation
there
were
many
police
officers
who
were
doing
this
investigation,
not
just
one.
they
would
have
to
gather
those
facts
and
put
them
into
some
presentable
form
to
present
to
a
prosecutor,
not
to
a
judge
but
first
to
a
prosecutor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
under
new
york
law,
as
is
true
in
some
other
states,
you
cannot
get
an
arrest
warrant
until
you
initiate
the
criminal
prosecution.
that
is
not
a
police
decision,
that
is
a
prosecutorial
decision.
so
you
have
to
take
all
of
those
facts
and
you
have
to
go
down
to
the
prosecutor's
office.
now,
i
have
personally
been
involved
in
questioning
police
officers
about
their
investigations.
it
is
not
a
process
which
any
responsible
prosecutor
would
just
slough
off
because
it
is
the
initiation
of
a
criminal
prosecution
that
is
at
stake.
it
is
--
and
it
is
the
more
complicated
the
investigation,
the
more
complicated
the
questioning
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
your
honor,
you
--
he
did
--
he
didn't
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
sir,
he
did
not.
there
was
no
warrant
requirement.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
sir,
he
should
not
have
because
if
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
oh
no,
no.
of
course
he
should've
thought
very
carefully
whether
he
had
the
right
man.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
absolutely
not.
he
cannot
drop
by
the
magistrate's
office.
he
has
to
first
drop
by
the
prosecutor's
office
and
be
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
under
the
--
under
the
law
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
absolutely,
it
is,
yes.
after
--
after
he
goes
to
the
prosecutor's
office
in
order
to
get
a
warrant,
there's
still
much
more
that
has
to
be
--
that's
--
then
at
that
time
you
first
get
into
the
problem
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
sir,
there
are
--
but
there
are
cases
in
which
the
prosecutor
would
say
you
have
probable
cause
but
i'm
not
going
to
authorize
the
initiation
of
a
criminal
prosecution
because
i
don't
think
we
have
enough
to
convict.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
it
might.
it
might
because
--
for
example,
one
reason
might
be
that
--
a
typical
situation
is
if
there's
been
a
photo
array,
as
there
was
in
this
case.
we
know
as
prosecutors
that
photo
arrays,
although
they
amount
--
they
may
amount
to
probable
cause,
are
not
the
most
reliable
in
terms
of
convicting
--
convincing
a
juror
--
a
jury.
the
police
may
have
to
get
the
defendant
into
custody
first
so
that
they
can
have
a
lineup.
but
once
they
have
a
lineup
and
if
the
defendant
picks
the
--
if
the
complainants
pick
the
defendant
out
of
the
lineup,
well
then
you
obviously
have
a
much
stronger
case.
so
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
this
warrant
process
is
not
a
one,
two,
three
affair.
it's
a
very
time-consuming
situation
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
right.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
there
then
you
have
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well
then
you
have
all
of
the
paper
work
that's
attendant
upon
filing
the
case
in
court,
and
if
you're
lucky
the
court
will
be
open
at
that
time,
you
can't
get
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
sir.
you
can't
have
an
arrest
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
but
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it's
a
matter
of
the
new
york
law
which
says
that
you
can't
get
an
arrest
warrant
until
you
have
a
criminal
action
that's
begun.
that's
true.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
initiated,
that's
true.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
don't
know
how
many
other
states
have
that,
but
i
do
know
that
new
york
is
not
alone
in
that.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
for
--
ultimately
for
a
felony,
yes,
there
has
to
be
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
an
arrest
warrant,
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
then
the
grand
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--
then
the
case
would
go
to
a
grand
jury.
oh,
you
mean
in
terms
of
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
to
get
an
arrest
warrant,
you
go
into
court
and
you
have
to
docket
the
case
and
then
you
have
to
wait
your
turn
on
the
calendar,
you
go
before
a
judge
and
the
statute
then
says
of
the
judge
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
the
prosecutor
and
the
policeman
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
it
will
be
a
prosecutor
or
probably
and
a
policeman.
and
then
you
go
into
court
and
if
the
judge
--
who
by
the
way
is
doing
a
lot
of
other
things
at
that
time,
will
see
you,
he
--
he
then
has
the
--
well,
now
he
has
the
option
to
question
the
police
officer
or
question
the
basis.
prior
to
this
criminal
procedure
law,
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
law
that
he
was
required
to
go
beyond
just
what
was
before
him
on
papers
and
question
the
police
officer,
and
then
if
he
was
satisfied
that
there
was
probable
cause
he
would
issue
the
warrant.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
the
magistrates
are
the
criminal
court
judges.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
in
new
york
city,
i'm
pretty
sure
that's
true.
i
don't
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i'm
not
positive
about
upstate
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i'm
saying
that
the
magistrates
are
the
criminal
court
judges,
which
is
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
those
courts
have
been
abolished.
now,
it's
a
--
it's
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
sir,
the
same
man
is
now
a
judge.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
and
(inaudible)
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
(inaudible)
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
can't
account
for
their
decision
except
it's
suggested
that
it's
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
but
their
experiences
are
really
with
a
different
system,
your
honor.
it's
a
--
i
was
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
now
i'm
a
state
prosecutor.
it's
a
world
of
different.
i
mean,
the
resources
are
much
different
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decision
and
also
my
colleague
points
out
to
you
that
i
think
they
would
be
foreclosed
from
applying
this
rule
in
federal
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--
in
stone
against
powell.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
so
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
so
it's
a
very
different
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
exactly
the
problem.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
what
could
be
happening
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
defendant
could
be
escaping.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
they
could
do
that,
but
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
very
wrong
for
this
court
to
require
that
sort
of
conduct.
it's
very
dangerous
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
what
they
would
do?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
realistically
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes.
well,
what
--
that
would
require
is
a
stakeout,
and
i
think
that's
a
very
dangerous
sort
of
thing
whether
they
would
do
it,
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
i
suppose
in
some
cases
they
would
and
in
other
cases
--
in
other
cases
they
would've
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
and
the
manpower
of
the
--
of
that
particular
squad.
that's
another
problem
with
this
arrest
warrant
requirement
is
that
it's
a
--
it's
a
going
to
be
applied
to
--
in
a
neighborhood
of
22,000
police
departments
throughout
the
united
states
and
also
in
an
infinite
variety
of
investigations,
so
that
really
will
be
unpredictable
in
a
particular
--
any
particular
case
would
be
unpredictable.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
could
he
have
gotten
the
warrant
in
18
hours?
i
assume
so.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
the
facts
--
the
way
they're
reasoning
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
the
facts
were
not
given
to
him
at
noon
on
one
day.
they
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
all
they
knew
at
noon
on
the
day
before
was
they
had
a
--
one
person
saying
that
he
recognized
the
man
who
did
the
job
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that
was
much
later.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that
was
well
into
the
afternoon
and
into
the
evening.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
the
issue
isn't
really
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
not
necessarily
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
not
necessarily.
i
mean,
the
warrant
does
not
protect
the
privacy
in
that
--
in
that
manner
because
you
can
bust
down
the
door
with
a
warrant,
too.
what
happen
if
--
if
the
police
had
a
warrant
in
this
case,
they
would
have
busted
down
the
door
exactly
the
same
way
because
they
had
--
they
heard
--
they
saw
a
light
underneath
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
if
the
--
if
you're
saying
that
they
wouldn't
have
gone
to
arrest
this
man,
obviously
then
they
wouldn't
have
broken
down
his
door,
that's
true.
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
--
it's
fair
to
suggest,
however,
that
the
warrant
requirement
will
somehow
be
a
quantum
leap,
an
additional
protection
than
what
the
residents
already
have.
i
mean
you
have
to
--
it
seems
to
me,
be
concerned
with
the
fact
that
you're
talking
about
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases
and
the
possibility
of
trivializing
the
warrant
process.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
sir.
nor
--
i
heard
mr.
hellerstein
say,
was
there
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
defendant
was
in
the
particular
location
which
is,
by
the
way,
a
requirement
under
state
law,
by
statute.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
you
need
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
absolutely.
it's
--
it's
--
in
some
ways
i
think
as
those
--
one
of
my
points,
it's
more
protection
than
a
warrant
requirement
would
be.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
probable
cause
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--
to
believe
that
the
defendant
committed
the
crime
but
not
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
defendant
is
in
a
particular
location
which
is
required
under
state
law
which
is,
as
i
say,
more
protective
than
the
warrant
requirement
would
be,
assuming
it's
an
arrest
warrant
requirement
which
by
the
way,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
or
i
think
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist
or
mr.
justice
white,
i
forgot
who
asked
this
question,
every
court
that
i'm
aware
of
has
held
that
there
needs
to
be
a
warrant
requirement
has
said
there
has
to
be
only
an
arrest
warrant
requirement.
the
prescott
case,
which
is
a
ninth
circuit
case
that
mr.
hellerstein
refers
to
was
a
case
of
an
entering
to
a
third
party's
residence.
although
i
do
concede
that
there
is
dictum
in
that
case
which
suggests
that
the
third
--
that
the
ninth
circuit
would
require
a
full
blown
search
warrant.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
--
it
is
strong
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
agree.
it's
strong
dictum
but
it
is
dictum.
i
mean
that
particular
entry
i
think
was
into
the
girlfriend's
house
of
the
defendant,
it
was
--
anyway,
it
wasn't
the
defendant's
apartment
or
house
in
that
case.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
it's
not
only
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it's
not
only
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it's
not
only
that
the
people
are
mobile
and
can
escape,
but
in
most
--
or
in
many
situations
where
you're
talking
about
arrest,
it's
fair
to
suppose
that
the
defendant
or
the
suspect
knows
of
the
police
interest
before
the
police
--
at
the
very
same
time
that
the
police
are
gathering
their
evidence,
it's
fair
to
suppose
that
the
defendant
knows
of
the
police
interest.
it
makes
it
a
very
volatile
situation
which
is
very
different
from
the
search
warrant
situation.
if
you
take
eavesdropping,
for
example,
as
the
archetypical
search
warrant
situation,
the
subject
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i'm
not
suggesting
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
won't
be
any
situations
in
which
you
search
that
would
be
volatile.
obviously,
there
will
be
some
situations
but
i'm
talking
about
as
a
gross
matter,
and
that's
why
the
judgment
was
made.
there's
a
second
very
important
point
and
that
was
the
point
of
numbers.
take
new
york
city,
for
example.
in
new
york
city
last
year,
there
were
107,000
felony
arrests.
in
new
york
county,
which
is
manhattan,
one
of
the
five
counties
of
new
york
city,
there
were
36,000
felony
arrests.
there
were
in
the
order
of
600
search
warrants
issued
in
new
york
county
last
year.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
absolutely,
i
think
this
is
a
perfectly
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
you
don't
but
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
i
do
know
that
mr.
hellerstein
cited
a
study,
we've
cited
the
same
study
in
our
brief
that
finds
that
fully
half
the
felony
arrests
in
urban
centers
in
this
country
take
place
two
hours
or
more
after
the
commission
of
the
crime.
so
that
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
police
officers
do
not
necessarily
know
in
advance
where
to
find
the
defendant.
so
those
are
the
situations,
at
least
that's
the
universe
from
which
the
police
officers
are
going
to
have
to
go
get
a
warrant
since
they're
not
going
to
know
in
advance
where
they're
going
to
find
him.
there's
another
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
fourth
amendment
by
its
terms
talks
about
reasonableness.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
oh,
absolutely,
i
think
that's
both
true,
but
i
also
--
it's
not
only
historical
antecedents,
i
think
there's
a
great
logic
to
it,
and
the
logic
of
the
difference
between
the
way
that
the
two
situations
are
treated
is
as
i
have
suggested
of
the
arrest
situation
is
much
more
volatile,
also
the
community's
interest
in
the
two
situations
is
very
different.
i
--
obviously,
it's
very
important
for
police
officers
to
gather
evidence
to
convict
someone
of
a
crime,
but
that
interest
it
seems
to
me
palls
next
to
the
interest
of
the
community
in
getting
the
defendant
into
custody
so
that
the
civilizing
processes
of
law
can
be
brought
to
bear
on
his
particular
case,
so
guilt
or
innocence
can
be
decided
by
a
court.
there
is
no
--
in
my
judgment,
there
is
no
law
enforcement
or
community
interest
that
is
greater
than
that,
and
that's
another
reason
why
and
there's
a
third
reason
why
there's
a
--
maybe
i'm
up
to
the
fourth
or
fifth
reason
why
there's
a
big
difference,
and
that
is
that
the
power
to
search
is
a
much
broader
power.
evidence
of
a
crime
can
be
anything,
it
can
be
anywhere,
and
it
can
be
in
anybody's
custody,
especially
now
after
warden
v.
hayden
and
(inaudible)
the
need
for
a
requirement,
even
independent
of
the
finding
of
probable
cause,
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
search,
to
tell
the
police
officer
what
he
can
look
for
and
where,
and
also
to
tell
the
subjects
of
the
search
what
can
be
looked
for
and
where
is
crucially
important,
and
that's
very
different
from
the
arrest
power
which
is
by
its
nature
very,
very
limited.
it's
obvious
to
everybody
concerned,
you
don't
need
a
warrant
to
tell
police
officers
what
the
object
is.
it's
one
particular
person,
and
what
to
do
with
that
person
is
to
bring
him
before
a
court,
and
those
are
some
of
the
reasons
for
the
historical
difference,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
i
am
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
should
not
apply
to
this
particular
case,
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
among
others.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
and
the
reason
we
put
--
we
made
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that
point
in
our
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes.
we
made
that
some
argument
in
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
in
the
original
brief,
but
we
just
updated
it
with
defillippo
and
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
sir.
but
i
have
--
what
i
can
say
about
that
is
your
honor
that
in
1970,
when
these
officers
made
entry
into
this
apartment,
there
was
almost
nothing
that
they
could
have
seen
around
them
that
would
have
led
them
to
believe
that
they
should
not
follow
the
statute
that
they
were
following.
now,
that
statute
had
been
on
the
books
for
a
hundred
years,
it
was
not
a
dead
letter,
it
was
part
of
the
living
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
was
not
a
jarring
exception.
thirty
out
of
36
states
that
had
legislated
on
this
subject
had
precisely
the
same
authorization.
there
wasn't
a
hint
of
--
in
anything
in
this
court
that
that
sort
of
that
conduct
was
illegal
in
any
way.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
in
1971,
excuse
me,
that's
coolidge.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
jones
was
a
nighttime
entry,
and
the
court
was
very
specific
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
warden
against
hayden
was
previous,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
wasn't
until
--
wasn't
it
previous
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes.
but
i
think
it's
fair
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--
that
it
wasn't
until
your
decision
--
your
decision
in
coolidge
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that
--
that
was
a
hint.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
so
--
well,
anyway
this
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
there
is
no
law
enforcement
official
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
there's
no
law
enforcement
official
in
this
country
who
would
not
tell
a
police
officer,
i
don't
care
what
that
statute
says,
you
better
watch
out,
this
--
there's
trouble
ahead
if
you
obey
that
statute.
if
--
if
these
police
officers
had
come
to
a
group
of
law
enforcement
officials
and
professors
of
law
and
judges
at
that
time
and
said,
now,
what
should
we
do,
shall
we
follow
the
statute,
i
think
what
those
people
would
have
said
is
absolutely,
they
--
i
mean,
it's
the
law,
there's
no
--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
sir,
not
true.
if
--
if
for
example,
myself
as
a
prosecutor,
if
a
police
officer
came
to
me
in
that
situation
that
you
posited,
i
would
say
--
probably
i
would
say
don't
follow
the
statute,
but
if
i
didn't
say
that,
i
would
at
least
say
you
follow
it
at
your
risk,
and
that's
--
i
wouldn't
have
said
that
in
1970
in
this
situation,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
else
would
have
said
it
either.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
true.
