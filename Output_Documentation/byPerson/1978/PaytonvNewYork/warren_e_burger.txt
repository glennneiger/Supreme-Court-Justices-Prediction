chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
payton
against
new
york
and
riddick
against
new
york.
mr.
hellerstein,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
a
difference
to
your
position
if
he
had
made
the
arrest
with
these
steps
right
then
and
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
the
miller
case
under
a
federal
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
hellerstein.
mr.
zimroth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
said
that's
--
had
to
be
an
effort
to
minimize
the
use
of
force,
are
we
to
take
that
as
meaning
that
you're
drawing
on
the
reasonableness,
the
term
unreasonable
in
the
fourth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
you're
going
to
the
midnight
search,
2
o'clock
in
the
morning,
when
presumably
most
people
have
their
house
closed,
they're
asleep,
what
do
you
say
about
breaking
down
the
door
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
take
that
much,
mid
--
exactly
your
circumstances,
midnight,
2
o'clock
in
the
morning,
every
--
the
house
is
dark,
everyone
is
asleep.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
some
case
in
which
there
was
an
observation
made
not
by
this
court
but
by
--
perhaps
one
of
the
courts
of
appeals
or
state
supreme
courts
says
that
that
type
of
a
breaking
and
entering
might
produce
the
deaths
of
some
police
officers
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
you
can
ponder
on
those
questions.
mr.
zimroth
you
may
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
didn't
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
understand
your
friend
to
be
suggesting
that
a
warrant
must
be
obtained
in
every
case
just
because
time
would
permit
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
there
are
numerous
counties
in
the
united
states
that
have
no
judge,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
any.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
the
warrant
an
authority
to
arrest
wherever
found?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
that
affect
the
city
of
new
york
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
any
risk,
mr.
hellerstein,
any
risk
that
if
30,000
warrants
must
be
obtained,
if
that
was
the
figure
in
some
relatively
small
metropolitan
area,
small
geographically
that
the
value
of
the
warrant
will
be
depreciated
by
the
fact
that
what
the
police
will
have
to
do,
law
enforcement
will
have
to
do
would
be
to
setting
motion
to
some
of
the
new
electronic
equipment,
word
processing
machines
where
you
will
get
your
warrant
from
the
prosecutor
to
the
magistrate
the
issuing
officer
to
the
police
officer
all
transmitted
by
wires?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
should
think
it
sounded
low
to
me
for
a
city
like
new
york.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
arrests,
home
or
not
home
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
not
the
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
the
issue
in
my
hypothetical
question
is
relating
to
arrests.
and
your
--
for
the
purposes
of
your
case,
you're
narrowing
it
not
just
to
the
home
but
to
an
arrest
in
somebody's
home,
a
dwelling,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
test
that
by
this
hypothetical
--
not
hypothetical,
real
question.
how
many
warrants
would
you
just
guess
roughly
have
been
issued
and
are
outstanding
and
have
not
yet
been
executed
in
the
city
of
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
all
the
policeman
in
new
york.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thousands
aren't
there,
thousands?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
look
at
the
statistics
and
you
find
that
at
any
given
time
in
any
big
city
there
are
thousands
of
arrest
warrants
outstanding
and
when
a
policeman
has
any
doubt
they
have
a
system
of
checking
in
to
see
if
there's
an
outstanding
warrant
on
a
person
they've
stopped
for
a
traffic
accident.
or
the
policemen
may
have
six
outstanding
warrants
in
his
pocket
for
his
particular
precinct
or
district.
they
aren't
issued
with
the
view
that
necessarily
they're
going
to
be
executed
within
48
hours.
they
may
have
a
time
limit
by
law,
but
there
are
a
great
many
unexecuted
warrants
floating
around
in
police
departments
in
this
country.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
state
warrants,
i'm
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
an
arrest
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
a
warrant
is
in
anyway
infirm
that
it
does
no
more
than
give
the
name
of
the
person
to
be
arrested
without
any
address,
without
any
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
arrest
warrant,
an
arrest
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
--
well,
yes
or
no
under
the
federal
constitution,
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what,
premises
of
the
person
to
be
arrested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
extraordinary
thing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
real
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the
net
of
your
argument.
is
it
this
that
whenever
there
is
an
arrest,
it
can
be
made
without
a
warrant
only
if
they're
arrested
in
a
public
place?
if
they
are
arrested
anywhere
else,
they
must
have
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
pieces
of
your
argument
add
up
to
that
for
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
his
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
where
does
the
constitution
help
you
there,
that's
what
we're
guided
by.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
lawyer's
office,
the
private
office.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
would
like
to
have
an
opportunity
to
examine
those
copies
of
bench
warrants
or
grand
jury
warrants
if
your
friend
has
no
objection,
would
you
leave
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you'll
deposit
them
with
the
clerk.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
payton
against
new
york,
and
riddick
against
new
york.
mr.
hellerstein,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
plain
view
doctrine
would
be
an
exception
to
all
of
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
while
they're
standing
inside
the
door
of
the
arrestee,
and
says
let
me
get
my
clothes
on,
they
see
a
pistol
or
whatever,
they
can
take,
of
course,
can't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
it
is
quite
important
that
under
section
3109
congress
had
given
specific
instructions
to
federal
officers
as
to
the
precise,
very
precise
manner
in
which
the
warrant
was
to
be
executed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
more
than
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
announced
their
purpose
and
their
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
authority
and
their
identity
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
think
the
opinion
said
a
few
more
words
would
have
sufficed
they
announced
part
of
what
the
statute
required
but
not
all,
if
i
recall
it
correctly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
had
expanded
what
the
constitution
required.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
no,
i
say
congress
had
expanded
what
the
constitution
required
and
the
--
and
the
officers
had
not
met
that
expanded
requirement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
zimroth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
meanwhile,
while
all
of
these
things
are
going
on,
what's
happening
out
at
the
ranch,
as
it
were?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
--
what
is
happening?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
could
--
i
suppose
they
could
get
four
or
five
policemen
and
surround
the
house,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
was
--
i'm
just
asking
you
what
they
would
do
if
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
prevent
the
man
from
getting
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
then
tries
to
walk
out
of
the
house,
they
can
--
they
can
of
course
arrest
him,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
depend
--
it
would
depend
upon
the
severity
of
the
crime,
i
suppose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hellerstein,
do
you
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
very
well.
thank
you
gentlemen
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
all
means.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
board
of
education
of
new
york
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
--
opinions
of
the
court
in
payton
against
new
york
and
riddick
against
new
york
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stevens.
