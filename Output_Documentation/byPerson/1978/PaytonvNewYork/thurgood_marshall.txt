justice
thurgood
marshall
this
would
have
to
go
simultaneous.
justice
thurgood
marshall
simultaneous
is
not
after
it,
it's
simultaneous
when
the
indictment
is
issued,
that's
issued
at
the
same
time
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
just
one
question
after
you
finished
talking
to
this
man
did
he
then
know
who
he
wanted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
he
have
gotten
a
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
--
does
the
warrant
say
he's
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
the
warrant
ever
say
he's
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
stop
him
from
getting
a
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what?
will
it
inconvenience
him
to
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
yet
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
a
warrant
in
new
york
city,
as
if
i
don't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
new
york
city?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
know
where
that
is
but
where
is
this
figure
that
takes
six
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
aren't
there
magistrates'
courts
right
in
the
police
area?
justice
thurgood
marshall
never?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
washington
heights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
some
might
not
even
have
a
judge.
why'd
you
go
to
the
whole
hope
while
you're
at
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
some
counties
might
not
even
have
a
judge
that
could
issue
a
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
west
virginia
is
one
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
you
have
a
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
we're
standing
--
what
i'm
talking
about
is
a
place
that
has
more
than
one
judge
who's
available
and
you
don't
have
to
travel
86,000
miles.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
the
arrest
warrants
in
new
york
limited
to
a
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they're
limited
to
a
person.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can
pick
them
up
any
place.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
pay,
how
did
they
pay
the
price?
did
you
put
them
in
jail?
did
you
give
the
people
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
oh,
excuse
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
you
bring
any
action
against
the
police
who
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
have.
there
was
nothing
to
stop
you,
was
there,
from
bringing
an
action
against
the
police
who
broke
down
the
door
and
the
man
wasn't
there,
and
then
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
very
well.
mr.
hellerstein,
do
you
have
anything
further?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
most
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
most
places,
the
last
place
you'll
find
him
is
at
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
--
if
he
knows
you
got
his
address,
that's
the
last
place
he's
going
to
be.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hellerstein
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
need
a
new
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
help
me
mr.
hellerstein,
i
have
never
seen
a
warrant
that
said
what
you
said,
that
this
is
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
john
doe,
and
if
you
find
him
in
his
house,
you're
going
to
arrest
him
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
never
seen
one
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
isn't
john
--
i
mean
this
is
james
smith.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is,
what's
his
name,
theodore
payton,
and
if
you
find
him
at
home,
you
can
arrest
him
at
home.
i've
never
seen
a
warrant
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
the
warrant
had
to
say
that
they
can
arrest
him
at
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
say
so
in
the
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
whom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
in
payton
the
--
the
light
was
on
and
they
heard
a
radio
or
something.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
did
have
a
reason
to
believe
there
was
somebody
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
a
warrant
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
since
you
and
i
both
know
manhattan,
i
wonder
how
(voice
overlap)
long
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
do
all
of
this
before
he
broke
in
the
man's
door?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
do
all
of
this
before
he
got
the
crowbars
and
tore
the
man's
door
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
but
--
well,
shouldn't
he
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
shouldn't
have
thought
over
very
carefully
as
to
whether
he
had
the
right
man
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
i
thought
so.
but
after
that
couldn't
he
have
just
dropped
by
the
magistrate's
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
he
drop
by
the
prosecutor's
office
before
he
tore
the
man's
door
down?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
--
so
he
can
tear
the
man's
door
down
without
going
by
the
--
not
only
without
getting
a
warrant,
but
he
doesn't
even
have
to
check
with
the
prosecutor
to
tear
a
man's
door
down.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
your
theory?
is
that
your
theory
of
the
law
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
telling
me
there
are
no
magistrates
in
new
york
city?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
there
magistrates
holding
magistrates
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
the
same
man
who's
now
a
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
could
he
have
gotten
it
in
18
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
facts
were
given
to
him
at
noon
on
one
day
and
they
broke
into
his
place
at
7:30
the
next
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
he
take
a
good
place
and
show
them
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
later?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
know.
in
a
minute,
he
could
go
and
be
waiting
to
get
it
from
a
magistrate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
a
minute,
you
go
--
if
a
guy
is
as
expeditious
as
he
was,
he
could
have
gotten
a
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
is
very
simple,
with
the
warrant
the
man
keeps
his
door
and
his
privacy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
without
a
warrant,
he
loses
his
door.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
might
not
have
gotten
the
warrant.
they
might
not
have
been
able
to
convince
the
magistrate
that
they
were
entitled
to
it.
wouldn't
he
have
kept
his
door
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
didn't
--
it
doesn't
apply
to
this
case
because
they
didn't
go
to
any
official.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hellerstein,
i
have
a
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
with
him
about
how
long
it
takes
to
get
a
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
think
you
did.
