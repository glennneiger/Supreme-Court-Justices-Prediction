justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
zimroth,
when
you're
talking
about
a
--
the
necessity
for
a
warrant
or
when
your
colleague
is
talking
about
a
warrant,
is
it
an
arrest
warrant
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
it
not
only
an
arrest
warrant
but
a
warrant
to
enter
a
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
all
but
one,
what
about
the
one?
does
the
one
say
that
there
--
the
warrant
also
has
so
authorized
the
entry?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
must
there
then
--
and
to
get
that
kind
of
a
warrant,
must
you
show
probable
cause
to
believe
the
person
is
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
should
they
expressly
have
authorized
the
arrest
in
the
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
arrest
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
with
that
warrant
which
needn't
say
anything
about
the
home
and
i
assume
that
at
the
time
he
gets
the
warrant,
or
even
later,
he
need
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
at
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
that
when
he
--
if
he
purports
to
enter
the
house
with
or
without
force,
without
consent,
does
he
need
reasonable
cause
to
believe
or
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
he's
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that
--
for
that
part
of
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
for
that
part
of
it,
under
the
current
law
in
most
jurisdictions
including
new
york
i
take
it
where
there
isn't
a
need
for
a
warrant.
suppose
there's
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
the
officer
goes
to
the
house.
he
wants
to
arrest
him
in
the
house.
is
the
law
of
new
york
that
he
must
then
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
he's
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
warrantless
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
current
law
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
particular
--
on
that
particular
aspect
it
won't
make
any
value
in
entering
the
house.
it
won't
--
the
house,
it
won't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
with
or
without
a
warrant.
that
either
case,
he
must
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
he's
in
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
think
that's
--
isn't
that
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
whatever
it
is
the
standard
now
is
for
a
warrantless
arrest
in
the
house,
in
terms
of
whether
you
think
he's
there
or
not,
is
the
same
standard
as
you
would
accept
even
with
a
warrant
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
are
--
you're
warrant
requirement
then
that
you
are
asking
be
imposed
here
is
more
for
verifying
probable
cause
to
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
to
protect
the
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
to
protect
the
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
but
the
--
whether
you
get
the
warrant
or
not
isn't
going
to
change
at
all
the
rules
to
whether
you
can
enter
his
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
well
--
how
will
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
only
thing
the
warrant
will
do
that
you
want
is
to
say
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
man
committed
a
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
--
but
you
don't
want
any
--
you
don't
want
the
warrant
--
you
don't
want
to
involve
the
warrant
in
anything
about
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
don't
need
to
--
have
it
that
determined
by
a
warrant
that
he's
in
some
premises.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
told
me
awhile
ago
that
it
need
not
say
in
the
warrant
that
he'd
--
they
can
arrest
in
the
home.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
just
awhile
ago
it
did
not
require
any
showing
in
connection
with
getting
in
a
warrant
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
said
exactly
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
a
lot
of
circumstances
then
he'll
have
to
come
back
if
he
wants
to
--
because
you
--
i
am
sure
there'll
be
a
lot
of
arrest
warrants
issued
for
--
to
arrest
the
man
before
they
know
where
he
is
or
what
--
where
he
lives
or
anything
else
if
--
and
if
they
had
--
and
if
he's
got
that
kind
of
a
warrant
in
his
pocket
that
doesn't
authorize
an
arrest
in
a
home,
and
you
say
the
warrant
never
needs
to
do
that.
but
if
he
hasn't
--
if
there
were
some
--
if
he
doesn't
know
that
there
are
underlying
papers
that
establish
some
reason
to
believe
that
he's
in
some
house
like
his,
he's
got
to
go
back
to
the
magistrate
and
say,
“i
now
believe
this
man's
at
home
so
i
want
to
--
and
i
just
want
to
tell
that.
you
don't
need
to
change
the
warrant
i
just
want
to
tell
you
that.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
magistrate
have
to
agree
and
decide
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
reasonable
suspicion
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
then
does
he
then
have
to
make
a
decision
and
evidence
that's
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
what
about
the
federal
constitution?
does
it
require
him
to
make
some
conclusion
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
you're
arguing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
does
he
determine
it,
does
he
put
it
in
the
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
i
want
to
know
is
what
you
--
what
your
submission
is
the
federal
constitution
requires
the
magistrate
to
find
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
man
is
in
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
the
federal
constitution
requires,
like
the
state
law,
that
at
the
time
he
gets
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
must
be
federal
--
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
in
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
so
that
--
so
the
warrant
saying
really
doesn't
protect
the
house
then,
it
protects
--
it
really
is
a
protection
of
him
personally.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
put
it
this
way.
you
submit
this
on
your
brief,
your
position
is
on
here,
you
agree
with
the
position
you've
stated
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
your
big
worry
is
having
the
magistrate's
confirmation
as
to
probable
cause
to
--
that
this
man
committed
a
crime,
i
would
think
you
would
like
to
urge
that
just
generally
that
there
just
should
be
arrest
warrants
at
anytime
whenever
you
think
at
anytime
you
get
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
just
for
the
house
if
there'd
be
--
if
aim
of
this
protection
as
to
--
is
not
protected
--
if
it
isn't
aimed
at
protecting
the
privacy
of
the
home
but
just
probable
cause
to
commit
with
respect
to
the
commission
of
the
crime.
that's
general
applicability.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
might
be
back
though
another
day,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
what?
these
--
these
courts
have
come
to
what
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
just
asked
you
what
the
--
i
didn't
want
to
argue
--
what
is
of
--
what
are
those
cases
that
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
just
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
particular
person
committed
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
that
he's
in
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
any
--
does
any
court
that
you
know
require
search
warrants?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
--
to
do
--
to
do
both
what,
the
probable
cause
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
enter
the
house
because
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
man
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
minimally?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
--
minimally
the
ninth
circuit
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hellerstein,
are
there
some
courts
that
say
--
that
say
that
all
you
need
is
an
arrest
warrant
or
that
--
let's
say
--
say
there
is
a
court
that
says
you
need
only
probable
cause
to
enter
the
house,
you
don't
need
an
arrest
--
a
warrant
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
they
say
--
don't
some
of
those
courts
say
you
--
at
the
time
that
you
entered
the
house
you
must
have
probable
cause
not
only
to
arrest
but
to
believe
the
man
is
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
zimroth,
the
second
circuit
doesn't
seem
to
be
too
worried
about
the
impact
of
such
a
constitutional
holding
on
police
practices
on
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
but
they
know
that
in
--
that
on
habeas
corpus
they're
going
to
be
facing
this
same
issue
out
of
the
new
york
courts.
and
i
suppose
they're
not
going
to
say
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
federal
marshals
or
the
fbi
to
arrest
without
a
warrant,
and
yet
it's
all
right
for
a
state
officer,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
are
--
and
certainly
the
people
who
have
joined
in
those
opinions
in
the
second
circuit
have
been
--
they're
new
york
lawyers.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
--
have
the
second
circuit
or
the
federal
courts
applied
the
second
circuit
rule
in
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
stone.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
very
quick.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
about
dictum,
it
says
that
a
warrant,
whatever
it
is,
the
warrant
must
describe
the
place
to
be
searched
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
thing
to
be
seized
which
in
this
case
is
a
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
real
practical
difference,
since
you
want
to
talk
practicalities
between
the
jurisprudence
that
your
prudential
approach
on
persons
and
things?
you
say
historically
you
don't
--
you
don't
need
a
warrant
to
enter
a
house
to
make
an
arrest,
but
i
take
it
--
i
guess
you
were
going
to
say
because
people
are
so
mobile
and
can
escape.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
just
--
they
can
leave
the
house
with
the
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
would
lead,
let's
say,
that
you
wouldn't
need
a
--
you
wouldn't
need
a
warrant
to
go
in
a
house
to
get
a
gun.
that
that
was
--
you
--
the
--
you
think
the
gun
is
in
the
house,
you
could
get
a
search
warrant,
you
have
probable
cause
but
you
need
the
warrant,
although
the
man
that
you
suspect
could
easily
leave
the
house
with
the
gun.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
don't
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
yet,
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
gun
is
in
the
house
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
suggest
that
even
if
there
are
a
lot
of
cases,
when
you
think
you
might
--
that
there
might
--
a
warrant
might
reasonably
be
required,
you
just
say
that
as
a
--
you
need
a
crude,
broad
rule
that
people
can
--
a
bright
line
of
some
kind.
