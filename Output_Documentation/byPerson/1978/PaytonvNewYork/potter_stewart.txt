justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hellerstein,
you
said
of
the
three
factors,
you
said
one
of
them
was
that
the
court's
view
that
an
arrest
entry
was
more
intrusive
or
less
intrusive?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
including
a
washing
machine
in
that
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
after
a
grand
jury
indictment,
is
a
warrant
generally
obtained
in
new
york,
or
do
they
--
does
it
--
is
it
considered
that
the
indictment
is
the
equivalent
of
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
an
indictment
or
an
information?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
so-called
grand
jury
indictment
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
grand
jury
warrant
or
bench
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
warrant
is
issued
in
both
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
after
a
charge
is
formally
filed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
either
by
grand
jury
or
information.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
about
the
only
time
that
in
new
york
to
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
an
arrest
warrant
is
issued.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
an
affidavit
generally
is
enough
to
support
a
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
determines
whether
or
not
there
will
or
will
not
be
a
warrant
in
a
non-grand
jury
or
non-bench
warrant
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
who
informs
the
policeman's
judgment,
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
but
sometimes
it
is
done.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
apparently
just
depends
upon
the
whim
of
the
policeman?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
how
much
and
what
does
it
say?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
do
you
think
it
says?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
question
is
what
is
unlawful,
isn't
it?
i
mean
that's
the
question
of
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you
concede
there
must
be
probable
cause,
and
i
gather
you
just
conceded
that
there
is
a
duty
to
minimize
the
forcibleness,
forcibility
of
the
entry
and
beyond
that
nothing
for
an
arrest
of
a
person
inside
his
own
house?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
requiring
a
additionally.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it
were
at
nighttime,
what
additionally
would
be
required
by
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
to
say
it
--
the
court
would
only
hold
to
the
constitution
imposes
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i.e.
there
has
to
be
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
has
to
be
a
minimumization
of
the
enforcements?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
say
that
was
the
evidence
in
some
other
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
the
federal
system?
this
is
your
case
and
the
state
system.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
know,
there's
nothing
that
shows
any
answer
to
my
brother
marshall's
opinion
--
question?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
all
those
things
are
true
about
a
search
warrant
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
them
or
a
majority
of
them
in
people's
homes?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hellerstein,
it
apparently
is
the
fact
concededly
that
in
some
situations
at
least,
new
york
does
habitually
provide
for
arrest
warrants,
i.e.
grand
jury
warrants
and
bench
warrants
if
nothing
else.
justice
potter
stewart
let's
assume
a
law
enforcement
officer
is
armed
with
a
grand
jury
warrant
that
somebody's
been
indicted
in
absentia.
first
of
all,
does
the
warrant
say
he
can
enter
his
home
only
if
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
he's
at
home?
justice
potter
stewart
say
what?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
why
i
asked
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
warrant
say.
there's
no
need
for
a
supporting
affidavit
is
there
if
there's
an
indictment?
if
there's
an
indictment
that
takes
the
place
of
an
affidavit.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
his
home
address?
justice
potter
stewart
usually?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
does
it
--
are
there
any
additional
provisions
if
he's
at
home?
justice
potter
stewart
any
additional
requirements
if
he's
at
home?
does
they
have
to
--
somebody
have
to
show
probable
cause
to
--
for
the
officer
to
have
thought
that
he
--
that
the
prospective
arrestee
was
in
fact
at
home?
justice
potter
stewart
with
any
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
probable
cause
to
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hellerstein,
i'm
both
confused
and
disturbed
now
in
view
of
your
answers
to
some
of
my
colleagues
questions.
you're
contending
here
that
the
constitution
requires
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you,
as
i
understood
it
to
say
that
if
a
law
enforcement
officer
is
armed
with
an
arrest
warrant
such
as
you
say
in
this
case
the
constitution
requires.
then
he
is
authorized
to
arrest
the
person
wherever
he's
found,
you
said
that
didn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
that
give
greater
or
lesser
protection
to
the
interest
of
homeowners
if
he's
armed
with
a
warrant
to
arrest
an
individual,
can
he
then
break
into
every
house
in
the
neighborhood
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
looking
for
that
individual
because
it's
a
valid
arrest
wherever
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
person
is
in
fact
found
whatever
the
suspicion
maybe
as
to
whether
he's
going
to
be
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well
no,
no,
no
but
where
--
not
here
to
bother
about
new
york
statutes
or
the
statutes
of
any
other
states.
we
don't
have
any
business
with
those
except
as
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
they
may
involve
a
federal
question,
where
--
to
here
as
to
what
the
--
does
the
federal
constitution
require?
justice
potter
stewart
to
arrest
the
person.
justice
potter
stewart
wherever
found.
justice
potter
stewart
but
obviously
when
they
get
the
--
they
won't
know
at
the
time
whether
the
man
is
in
his
home
or
not
in
his
home
or
maybe
he's
out
in
the
public
street
or
some
other
public
place
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
maybe
it's
in
somebody
else's
home.
so
what
they
do
is
get
a
warrant
to
arrest
him,
right,
under
your
submission?
does
the
constitution
requires
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
what
i
didn't
get.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought
what
you
said
too.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it
is
an
arrest
warrant,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
what?
justice
potter
stewart
then
at
that
time?
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
--
is
it
--
would
be
sufficient
if
he
just
knows
where
his
home
is?
justice
potter
stewart
the
address
of
his
home?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
john
smith
and
he
lives
at
2020
main
street.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
enough?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
say
you
can
arrest
him
in
public
without
that
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
can
arrest
him
in
his
home
only
with
that
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
that's
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
protection
of
him
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
he's
in
his
house.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it
says
john
smith
and
address
unknown
--
justice
potter
stewart
john
smith
address
unknown
and
his
address
is
unknown.
justice
potter
stewart
that
there's
plenty
of
reason
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there's
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
john
smith
committed
a
criminal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
he
can
be
arrested
in
a
public
place
without
a
warrant.
he
can
be
arrested
in
his
or
somebody
else's
home
only
with
a
warrant
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
in
each
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
each
of
these
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
petitioner
about
--
is
both
payton
and
riddick,
were
arrested
in
their
--
respectively
in
their
own
residences,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event,
the
entry
was
into
the
residence
of
each
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
payton
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
riddick
as
well.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
each
case
the
residence
was
what,
an
apartment
in
new
york
city?
justice
potter
stewart
half
a
house.
justice
potter
stewart
which
case?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
the
new
york
courts
held
here?
justice
potter
stewart
in
each
of
these
cases,
you
--
do
you
concede
that
there
was
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
therefore
that
an
arrest
warrant
could
have
properly
issued?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
these
two
cases,
even
if
the
state
is
correct,
that
wouldn't
lead
to
a
lot
of
intensive
indiscriminate
searching.
the
search
incident
to
the
--
to
the
arrest
would
be
limited
by
the
contours
delineated
in
the
chimel
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
anything
else
would
just
be
subject
to
plain
view.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
here,
even
if
the
threat
is
--
if
the
state
is
correct,
a
threat
of
an
intensive
search
throughout
the
house.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
that
was
their
only
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
any
search
would
be
limited
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
limitations
of
chimel
plus
they
could
have
seized
anything
in
plain
view.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
state
is
correct,
period.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
if
they're
lawfully
there.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
arresting
somebody
in
the
third
person's
home?
justice
potter
stewart
you'd
be
satisfied
with
an
arrest
warrant
even
to
support
the
search,
the
breaking
in
of
the
home
of
john
smith
because
the
officers
suspected
that
the
object
of
the
warrant
might
be
there?
justice
potter
stewart
or
likely
mary
smith?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
still
authorize
to
arrest
the
innocent
--
the
man
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
he
now
thinks
is
--
whom
he
now
thinks
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
it's
an
authorization,
not
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
a
command.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
point.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
aguilar
and
--
held
more
than
that.
justice
potter
stewart
held
that
a
--
a
warrant
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
that
you
finished
really.
you
say
--
you
say
that's
a
several
step
process,
and
i
think
you've
just
given
us
the
first
step,
you
go
to
the
prosecutor.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
assume
you
persuade
the
prosecutor
that
there
is
enough
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
evidence
for
him
to
initiate
a
criminal
prosecution.
then
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
a
matter
of
new
york
law,
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law,
all
of
this
has
to
precede
the
issuance
of
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
or
constitutionally
it
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
just
a
matter
of
new
york
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
the
practice
and
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
initiated.
justice
potter
stewart
so
then
--
then
the
prosecutor
files
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
he
files
an
information,
new
york
is
not
required
a
grand
jury
indictment,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
for
this
--
for
the
purposes
of
a
search
warrant,
it
can
be
just
on
information.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
an
information
is
filed
and
then
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
to
get
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
who's
--
who's
"you"
now?
who
has
to
wait
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
prosecutor
or
the
policeman?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
a
judge
can
issue
a
warrant
in
the
state
of
new
york?
do
you
have
magistrates
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
period,
there
are
no
other
magistrates,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
--
even
though
it
is
his
own
residence?
justice
potter
stewart
i
can
understand
that
the
requirement
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
somewhere
else
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
does
state
law
require
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
in
his
own
home?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
that
a
warrant
requirement
requires
the
disinterested
third
person
to
evaluate
probable
cause,
that's
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
the
protection
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
how
many
of
those
arrests
were
in
public
places,
or
do
you
know
how
many
of
them
were
under
exigent
circumstances?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn't
you
--
didn't
you
guess
that
a
good
--
a
large
proportion
were
--
one
or
the
other
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
make
a
point
in
your
supplementary
brief
that
i
suppose
would
lead
to
the
consequence
that
even
if
we
decide
against
you,
our
decision
should
be
prospective
only?
justice
potter
stewart
should
not
apply
to
these
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
relying
as
you
do
upon
a
decision
of
the
court
late
last
term.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
michigan
against
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
defillippo.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
original
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
addressed
yourself
orally
to
that
point
at
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
were
hints
from
this
court,
weren't
there,
in
1970?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
jones.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
warden
against
hayden
decided?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
had
only
asked
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
submit
that
there
were
no
hints
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
new
york
law
have
said
--
what
if
the
statute
of
new
york
had
said
in
this
state
no
warrants
of
any
kind
shall
be
required
for
any
searches
and
seizures
of
any
kind,
and
that
the
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
been
clear
for
a
hundred
years?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
--
you're
employees,
you're
officers
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
that
is
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york.
that's
very
natural
advice
to
give.
and
--
so
would
it
have
also
i
guess
with
my
hypothetical
statute.
