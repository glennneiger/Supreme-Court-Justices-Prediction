justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
if
it's
only
in
most
states,
how
can
it
be
uniform
throughout
history?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
the
history
up
to
a
certain
point
in
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
about
probably
cause
to
believe
that
somebody
is
on
the
--
that
the
defendant
is
in
--
on
the
premises?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
that
the
--
the
narrow
issue
here
is
whether
you
need
some
kind
of
a
warrant.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
prosecutor,
may
i
just
to
be
sure
i
follow
your
argument.
are
you
saying
in
substance
that
there
are
a
good
many
cases
in
which
police
officers
think
they
have
probable
cause
but
the
prosecutor
says
there
isn't
enough
here
to
justify
a
warrant?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
then
in
those
cases
would
it
be
appropriate
for
the
police
officer
to
go
out
and
arrest
him?
