justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
for
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
under
a
new
york
statute,
illegitimate
children
may
inherit
from
their
intestate
fathers
only
if
they
have
obtained
a
judicial
order
of
paternity
during
the
father's
lifetime.
appellant,
who
claims
to
be
the
illegitimate
son
of
mario
lalli
was
not
permitted
to
participate
in
lalli's
estate
because
he
had
not
complied
with
the
statute.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
rejected
appellant's
argument
that
the
statute
denied
him
equal
protection
of
the
law
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
prior
decisions
have
made
clear
that
statutes
creating
classifications
based
on
illegitimacy
are
invalid
unless
they
are
substantially
related
to
important
governmental
interest.
we
think
the
new
york
statute
satisfies
this
test.
the
states
have
an
important
interest
in
the
just
and
orderly
disposition
of
property
upon
death.
determining
paternity
of
children,
born
out
of
wedlock
often
creates
vexing
evidentiary
problems
in
the
administration
of
estates
following
a
study
by
a
special
commission,
new
york
has
chosen
to
require
a
judicial
form
of
proof
recorded
during
the
father's
lifetime.
a
judicial
decree
assures
reliable
evidence
of
paternity
reducing
the
possibility
of
fraud,
error,
and
delay.
nor
is
this
an
unduly
burdensome
method
of
establishing
paternity.
we
therefore
hold
that
new
york's
solution
to
this
problem
satisfies
the
requirement
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart
have
joined
my
opinion.
the
latter
adding
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
a
separate
opinion
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
concurred
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
brennan
joined
by
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion.
