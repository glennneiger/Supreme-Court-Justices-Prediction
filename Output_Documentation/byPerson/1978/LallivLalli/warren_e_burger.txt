we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
lalli
against
lalli.
i
think
you
may
proceed
now,
mr.

e.

is
the
microphone
functioning?
no?
will
you
check
on
it
please?
we
will
give
you
a
time
out
mr.
henkin
without
charging
you
for
the
time.
you
maybe
seated
if
you
like
mr.
henkin
now.
you
maybe
seated
until
they
get
to
the
correction
here.
mr.
wong,
i
think
what
we'll
do
is
take
a
brief
recess
until
you
can
find
the
mechanical
problem
here.
[recess]
now,
you
may
proceed
mr.
henkin,
i
think
we're
functioning
again.

your
client
could
have
been
--
had
all
the
protection
you
now
seek
without
his
parents
being
married.
if
he
--
if
the
father,
the
natural
father
had
complied
with
the
statutory
requirements,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
expired
now,
mr.
henkin.
chief

e.

mr.
strum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
read
it
out
of
the
statute,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case,
they
just
ignored
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
two-year
limit
was
placed
by
the
legislature
or
probably
placed
there
by
the
legislature,
so
that
the
facts
could
be
ascertained
while
there
were
people
around
who
could
test
the
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
acquiesce
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
apparent
acquiesce
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
interpretation
by
its
constituent
courts,
mean
the
same
thing
or
should
it
mean
the
same
thing
to
us
as
a
holding
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
construing
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
should
it
be
equated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
perhaps
is
that
new
york
is
not
obliged
to
have
a
perfect
statute,
so
long
as
they
have
a
reasonable
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
your
time
is
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
lalli
against
lalli
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
