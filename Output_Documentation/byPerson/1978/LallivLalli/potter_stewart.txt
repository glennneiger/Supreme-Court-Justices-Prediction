let's
say,
a
father
and
mother
married
had
one
child,
under
the
laws
of
the
intent
of
succession
in
new
york
upon
the
father's
death,
does
what
the
mother
gets
two-thirds
and
the
child
one-third?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
one-half.
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
them
together
will
get
money?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
widow
of
the
deceased.
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
and
in
that
situation,
if
this
had
been
a
legitimate
child
under
the
laws
of
new
york,
how
would
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
decedent's
estates
had
been
shared?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
another
child?
justice
potter
stewart
a
legitimate
child?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
one
of
the
two
illegitimate
children?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
henkin,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
didn't
misunderstand
you.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
it's
--
you
tell
us
that
the
decedent
could
not
in
fact
or
in
law,
have
secured
a
certificate
of
affiliation
during
his
life
time?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
during
his
lifetime
he
could
not
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
have
a
secured
an
order
affiliation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
in
your
--
is
that
case
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
give
me
that
citation
again.
justice
potter
stewart

justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
has
to
be
made
during
the
pregnancy
of
the
mother
or
within
two
from
the
birth
of
a
child?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
the
statute
says?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
do
say
that
order
affiliation
could've
been
secured
under
new
york
law
at
the
behest
of
--
somebody
other
than
the
natural
father
during
the
natural
father's
lifetime?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
by
the
mother,
the
natural
mother?
justice
potter
stewart
or
anybody
else,
the
child?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
but
you
say
that
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact
the
natural
mother
wouldn't
have
done
it
and
why
was
that?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
--
was
she
the
--
his
sister-in-law?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
she?
she

her
name
was
lalli

potter
stewart

captain's
paradise?[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
but

event

order
of
affiliation
until

the
lifetime
of
