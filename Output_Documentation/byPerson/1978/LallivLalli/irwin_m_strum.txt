mr.
irwin
m.
strum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
does
not
discriminate
against
illegitimates
inheriting
either
from
their
mother
or
father.
it
merely
provides
in
the
case
where
an
illegitimates
is
claiming
through
his
father
that
there
be
an
order
of
a
new
york
court
determining
parentage
made
during
the
lifetime
of
the
father.
while
the
statute
does
refer
to
a
two-year
requirement,
the
new
york
courts
have
not
enforced
that
two-year
requirement
and
as
you
will
find
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
attorney
general,
there
are
decisions
which
indicate
that
is
not
the
law
of
new
york
at
the
present
time,
although
there
has
not
been
a
determination
on
that,
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no.
it
is
never
read
it
out
of
the
statute.
the
law
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes.
the
lower
courts
have.
they
have
treated
it
for
various
reasons
constitutional
and
otherwise
as
just
being
an
unwise
legislative
discribment.
but
other
than
that,
the
requirement
that
the
order
be
obtained
during
the
lifetime
of
the
father,
i
think
is
a
reasonable
one.
i
think
we're
here
not
to
consider
the
peculiar
equities
of
this
particular
case
and
there
maybe
equities
on
the
appellant
side,
i
don't
argue
that
there
are
not.
what
we're
here
to
evaluate
is
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
and
whether
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
protecting
its
citizens
and
in
passing
laws
with
regard
to
decedent's
distribution,
could
require
as
a
requirement
in
the
case
of
illegitimates
inheriting
from
their
father
that
there
be
a
court
order
during
the
lifetime
of
the
father
in
order
to
prevent
fraud,
in
order
to
prevent
a
situation
where
new
york
estates
would
not
be
closed.
obviously,
situations
could
arise
where
illegitimates
are
not
known
off
and
they
could
make
claims
later
on,
and
it
would
destroy
the
sanctity
of
decrees
which
determine
distribution
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
think
for
that
reason,
the
legislature
as
indicated
by
the
report
of
the
bennett
commission
was
justified
in
making
this
requirement.
i
think,
the
requirement
is
a
reasonable
one
and
i
think,
that
is
the
only
test.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes,
i
would
assume
that
was
the
purpose
behind
it.
i
can
understand
the
difficulty
in
requiring
it
within
two
years,
but
of
course,
if
you're
dealing
with
the
very
young
child,
baby,
and
perhaps,
you
don't
want
to
cut
off
that
child's
right.
so,
i
can
understand
why
the
new
york
courts
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
exercise
the
two-year
provision,
but
i
also
understand
why
it's
there
and
i
think
it's
a
functional
purpose.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
i
would
not
classify
it
as
a
holding
and
i
would
not
go
so
far.
but
i
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york,
yes,
i
think
it
can
be
equated.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
in
this
case
there
was
none
whatsoever
and
that
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no,
and
there
was
no
attempt
to
get
one.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes.
and
let
me
--
let's
be
clear
about
this.
this
statute
went
into
effect
in
1967.
the
decedent
in
this
case
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no.
the
statute
--
this
statute,
the
epto
went
into
effect
in
1967.
the
decedent
died
in
1974.
there
was
ample
opportunity.
the
appellant
was
an
adult.
there
was
an
ample
opportunity
for
him
to
go
to
court
during
a
lifetime
of
his
father.
if
he
believe
that
there
was
justification
for
such
an
application.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
that
is
the
statute
now
before
this
court.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no
other
statute.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
there's
no
showing
that
he
attempted
to
seek
counsel.
furthermore,
we're
not
discussing,
i
believe
your
honor,
probabilities
or
possibilities.
we're
discussing
of
statutory
scheme
and
i
think
the
legislature
in
making
that
determination
had
every
right
to
reason
require
this
and
i
think,
he
had
certainly
an
opportunity
to
go
to
court
and
make
an
application
and
if
the
court
then
would
have
turned
him
down,
he
could
have
appealed
on
that
basis.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
would
assume
so,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
he
could've
been
served
by
publication.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
you're
then
depriving
the
father
of
an
opportunity
to
give
evidence.
there's
a
difference
between
him
having
the
right
to
be
there
and
give
evidence,
and
participate
if
he
so
chooses
and
being
precluded
in
the
absolute
by
his
death
and
i
think
that's
a
distinction
which
is
important.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no,
your
honor.
i
think,
we
don't
reach
that
question
because
the
two-year
provision
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes,
but
i
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
don't
believe,
your
honor
that
we
should
be
talking
about
a
statute
in
the
abstract
necessarily.
we
should
be
talking
about
a
statute
as
applied
and
i
think
as
applied
in
this
case,
the
appellant
hasn't
ripened
question
because
there
was
no
attempt
to
obtain
the
order
of
affiliation
within
the
two-year
period
and
furthermore,
because
new
york
doesn't
apply
the
two-year
requirement.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
would
suggest
that
the
two-year
requirement
is
not
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no,
the
statute
should
not
be
ignored,
it
should
be
enforced.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
the
part
that
we
are
ignoring
or
i
suggest
be
ignored
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
the
courts
that
have
heard
that
question
have
agreed
to
that.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
there
are
citations
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes,
there
are.
they
get
a
rounded
for
various
reasons.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
not
those
words,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
but
the
courts
have
failed
to
apply
it.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
i
think
you
are
limited
to
the
facts
in
this
case
and
the
application
of
those
facts
to
the
statute.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
i
think
if
you're
going
to
say
that
the
requirement
that
it'd
be
during
a
lifetime
of
the
father
is
unconstitutional
then
i
think
the
whole
statute
would
probably
fail.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
personally,
i'm
not
suggesting
to
your
honor
that
the
two-year
requirement
is
unreasonable.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
am
saying
to
you
that
the
new
york
courts
when
considering
the
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no,
they
didn't
because
they
felt
it
was
not
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking
this
court
to
do.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
the
only
reason
i
raised
the
two-year
question
is
because
the
appellant
raised
it.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes,
matter
of
thomas,
matter
of
flemm.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes.
and
there
was
another
case
i
believe
matter
of
nurse.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes.
we
will
provide
those
citations
to
the
court.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
--
know
no
cases
where
that
question
has
arisen
where
the
new
york
courts
have
applied
that
two-year
statute.
i
believe
that
the
statute
in
illinois
which
this
court
considered
in
tremble
versus
gordon
is
completely
different.
that
statute
prohibited,
prohibited
in
the
absolute
inheritance
from
a
--
by
an
illegitimate
from
its
father
except
under
one
specific,
very
limited
circumstance
that
of
a
--
where
the
natural
mother
and
father
married
and
there
was
an
acknowledgment
to
that
point.
the
new
york
statute
does
not
attempt
in
any
way
to
discriminate.
it
merely
says,
in
the
case
where
someone
is
claiming
to
be
an
illegitimate
child
through
a
father
that
there
be
a
court
order
determining
that
during
the
father's
lifetime.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
as
a
substantial
difference,
not
only
in
approach
but
in
meaning.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes,
that
would
legitimatize.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
right.
that
would
be
illegitimately
under
another
statute
which
is
not
at
issue
here.
if
there
any
other
questions
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
that's
correct.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
unlike
the
illinois
statute
and
i
submit
that
had
the
situation
arose
as
applied
in
illinois
and
new
york,
there
would
have
been
--
an
inheritance
would've
been
permitted
because
there
was
a
court
order.
that's
all
the
new
york
law
says
there
has
to
be
a
court
order.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
sure.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
that
would
legitimatize
the
child.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
the
natural
father,
yes.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
you
wouldn't
know
except
it
would
be
a
question
to
proof.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
that
is
one
side
of
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
this
--
also
the
state
interest
is
in
seeing
to
it
that
there's
an
orderly
distribution
of
estates.
in
other
words,
the
situation
is
that
we
don't
wish
anyone
after
somebody
dies
to
come
in
and
make
a
claim
because
of
the
difficulty
of
proof,
and
because
of
the
question
of,
“you
would
have
to
keep
estates
open
for
an
inordinate
period
of
time”.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
but
that
--
because
you
would
have
to
publish
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes.
but
you
would
be
opening
the
--
opening
the
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
oh,
sure.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
it
could
except
--
except
that
you're
going
to
have
people
who
are
going
to
come
in
and
make
claims
and
say,
they
didn't
know
or
they
had
no
opportunity
of
knowing.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
that's
correct.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
how
your
honor
do
you
draw
the
line.
what
are
we
going
to
say?
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
again,
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no.
i
don't
think
you
discriminate.
i
think
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
set
the
standard
of
proof.
now,
providing
that
standard
of
proof
is
a
reasonable
one.
providing
the
requirements
are
reasonable
like
keeping
that
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
alright.
it
is
that
but
it
is
a
standard
of
eligibility
by
way
of
judicial
determination.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
that's
correct.
and
i
think
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
say,
“we
want
a
judicial
determination,
when
it
can
be
had,
and
when
it
can
fairly
be
had”
not
when
somebody
can
be
put
upon,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
would
happen
in
every
case
or
any
case,
i'm
saying
it
is
to
preclude
the
possibility.
so,
you
have
to
draw
a
line.
you
have
to
draw
standards.
you
have
to
mark
everything
off.
if
you
don't
mark
everything
off,
what
you're
going
to
have
is
confusion
and
chaos
and
i
think
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
do
that.
i
think
as
long
as
they
act
fairly
and
reasonably.
i
think
it's
within
their
right
and
i
don't
think
this
court
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
but
that's
a
determination
that
you
making
after
fact.
i
think
the
legislature
in
the
right
to
protect
its
citizens
has
the
right
in
the
first
hand
to
set
the
standards
and
i
think
people
are
then
required
to
live
up
to
those
standards
like
in
any
other
situation.
i
think,
we
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
quite
agree
with
the
chief
justice.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
facts.
this
case
came
up
on
very
incomplete
record.
your
honor,
there
was
a
motion
made
to
dismiss
with
regard
to
the
status.
so,
the
only
issue
before
the
court
was
the
status
of
the
claimant.
now,
the
attorney
general
was
not
a
party
at
that
time.
we're
only
a
party
with
regard
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
state's
statute
and
i
really
don't
want
to
comment
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no,
i'm
not.
because
i
--
i'm
not
in
a
position
to,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
agree
with
that
your
honors.
yes.
