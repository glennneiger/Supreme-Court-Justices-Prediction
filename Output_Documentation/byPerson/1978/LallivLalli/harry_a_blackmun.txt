justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
full?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
it's
you
position
that
he
supported
him
entirely
as
long
as
he
was
a
minor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
under
new
york
law
could
the
decedent
have
taken
care
of
this
child
by
will?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
did
not
do
so?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
almost
die
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
say
all
of
us
die.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
he
have
will?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
was
that
aileen's
son
by
another
man?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
robert's
formal
birth
certificate
in
the
record?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
a
reason
why
it
wasn't?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
henkin,
i
think
in
your
brief,
you
don't
site
labine
against
vincent?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
the
ground
what,
that
its
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you
think
that
the
trimble
against
gordon
really
overruled
vincent
against
labine?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
although,
it
didn't
say
so
on
so
many
words.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question
and
i'll
stop.
what
are
we
talking
about
here
is
totally
irrelevant
but
were
talking
much
money
or
about
very
little
as
was
the
case
in
the
trimble
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
if
he
still
draw
will?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what's
mother's
--
what's
the
widow's
position
in
all
this
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
she's
taken
the
position
that
this
is
not
his
child,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
say,
has
not
the
widow
taken
the
position
that
your
client
is
not
a
son
of
the
decedent?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
state
take
any
position
with
respect
to
this
claimant
that
all
was
to
whether
he
is
or
is
not
the
natural
child
of
the
decedent?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
you're
conceding
nothing
factual
here,
don't
you?
