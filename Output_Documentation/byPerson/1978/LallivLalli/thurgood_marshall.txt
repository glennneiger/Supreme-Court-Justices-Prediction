justice
thurgood
marshall
getting
back
a
minute
to
--
was
it
born
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can't
find
a
birth
certificate
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
obviously
he
had
a
birth
certificate,
if
he
was
born
in
new
york.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
anybody
look
for
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
born?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
born?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
why
was
he
denied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
was
he
denied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
up
until
1976
in
new
york,
it
must
have
been
the
last
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
in,
if
new
york
didn't
get
around
to
letting
children
inherent
from
their
father
when
1976,
wouldn't
that
make
on
to
the
last
date
to
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
have
to
advance
sheets?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
court
of
appeal
doesn't
have
the
advanced
sheets?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
strum,
if
i
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
we
say
that
this
statute
is
constitutional
and
not
unconstitutional
because
the
two-year
provision
will
never
be
enforced,
is
that
what
you
want
us
to
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
would
--
we
only
have
to
talk
about
that
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
have
to
mention
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
just
ignore
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
saying
about
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
we
mention
the
statute
and
ignore
a
part
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
saying
in
this
case
--
we
say
that
this
case
which
involves
a
28-year-old
man
is
not
bound
by
the
two-year
old
provision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
what
i
think
of
somebody
wrote
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
will
you
give
us
the
citation
so
we
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
citation
would
say
that
we
are
ignoring
the
two-year
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
well,
that's
not
what
i
said.
do
you
have
one
that
says,
“we
ignore
it?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right,
i
didn't
think
you
did.
i
didn't
find
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
we
limited
to
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
just
quote
the
court
of
appeals
because
they
have
passed
it
on
their
own
statute
and
they
didn't
say
a
word
about
the
two-year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
don't
we
just
base
our
opinion
in
what
they
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
in
new
york
somebody
is
got
56-year
old
child
and
they
get
married
at
that
child
is
legitimatized?
justice
thurgood
marshall
merely
by
the
marriage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
