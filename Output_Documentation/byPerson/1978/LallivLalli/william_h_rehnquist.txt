justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
henkin
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
your
--
the
father
and
mother
here
complied
with
the
new
york
law
and
did
not
marry.
would
you
explain
what
you
meant
by
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
he
would
have
been
guilty
of
bigamy
had
a
married
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
also
challenged
the
two-year
provision
of
the
new
york
affiliation
law,
did
it
not
in
the
separate
attack?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
you
could
have
challenged
the
statute
on
that
ground
that
you
did
challenge
then
but
wasn't
passed
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
henkin,
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
child
or
mother
can
apply,
can't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
statement
is
really
a
very
technical
one
that
the
father
couldn't
apply.
certainly,
a
proceeding
could've
taken
a
place
in
which
the
father
could
have
admitted
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
its
opinion
at
a-2
in
this
case
says
that,
“under
our
new
york
statute,
the
right
to
inherit
depends
only
on
proof
that
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
is
made
in
order
affiliation
declaring
paternity
during
the
lifetime
of
the
father.”
that
truly
is
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
certainly
not
going
--
well
we're
not
going
to
second
guess,
let
say
of,
new
york
court
of
appeals
on
what
new
york
law
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
if
he
sought
counsel,
counsel
might
have
advised
him
that
since
the
two-year
period
had
expired,
it
was
no
use?
