well
in
trimble
wasn't
there
or
hadn't
there
been
a
judicial
determination
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
prior
to
the
death
of
the
father?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
fact
is
if
there
was
a
judicial
determination
in
trimble?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
that
if
you're
talking
about
the
statutory
scheme,
i
suppose
under
the
statute,
if
there
was
a
court
order
prior
to
the
death
of
the
father,
obtained
on
the
petition
of
either
the
son
or
mother
it
would
be
--
it
would
satisfy
the
statute
whether
or
not
the
father
was
around,
could
be
found,
or
participated
in
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
could
go
to
court
and
say
the
father
had
disappeared
and
still
--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
but
nevertheless,
he
need
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
need
to
be
available
to
give
evidence
or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
wrong
then
with
the
day
after
the
father
dies,
what's
wrong
with
determining
the
inheritance?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how's
--
oh,
what
else
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's,
that's
the
real
reason
for
the
cut-off.
well,
supposing
the
papers
of
the
father
and
there
is
abundant
evidence
to
the
fact
that
he
is
not
just
as,
sort
of
someone
ambiguous
what
you
have
here,
but
he
is
repeatedly
acknowledged
it,
written
it
out
many,
many
times
that
the
person
involved
is
my
true
and
natural
son.
what
is
the
state
interest
in
giving
such
a
father
an
opportunity
to
contradict
what
he
has
said
repeated,
when
he
said
repeatedly
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
till
we
make
to
say
in
terms
of
standard
of
proof.
you
might
require
proof
beyond
all
doubt,
beyond
a
unreasonable
doubt,
something
like
that.
but
when
you
have
un-contradicted
proof
and
there
are
all
agreement
on
the
fact,
and
i
know
you
don't
have
that
here,
then,
what's
the
state
interest?
