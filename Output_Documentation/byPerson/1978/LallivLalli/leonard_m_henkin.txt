mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
second
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york.
on
the
first
appeal,
this
court
vacated
the
judgment
as
sent
the
case
back
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
your
decision
in
trimble
versus
gordon.
on
--
thereafter,
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
vote
of
five
to
two
disregarded
the
directive
of
this
court
and
attempted
to
distinguish
the
new
york
statute
involved,
which
brought
us
back
to
you.
this
statute
which
is
the
state's
powers
and
trust
law
section
4-1.2
requires
an
order
affiliation
to
be
obtained
within
two
years
after
the
birth
of
an
illegitimate
child
during
the
lifetime
of
the
father
before
the
child
can
participate
in
distribution
of
the
estate
of
his
natural
father.
the
attorney
general
indicates
that
he
does
not
concede
the
facts.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
first
opinion
clearly
states
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
uncontested.
the
decedent
was
killed
in
1974.
the
respondent
is
widow
is
not
here
on
this
appeal.
the
only
one
who
is
in
opposition
is
here
is
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
even
though,
she
has
a
bond
in
the
sum
of
$100,000.00
which
was
required
to
be
put
at
the
time
that
she
obtained
the
letters
of
the
administration.
the
appellant
was
born
out
of
wedlock.
it
is
conceded
that
no
other
affiliation
was
obtained.
also
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
i
think
he
was
about
26
or
28.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
much
order
than
two
years
old,
your
honor.
i
may
say
that
at
that
time,
there
was
procedure
in
new
york
at
the
time
the
father
died
where
by
the
father
would
bring
a
proceeding
in
order
to
have
the
child
declared
legitimate.
that
statute
was
enacted
thereafter
after
the
father
died.
there
is
no
marriage
claimed
to
have
taken
place
between
his
natural
parents.
the
appellant
was
acknowledge
by
the
decedent
as
his
son,
in
writing,
duly
acknowledged
before
a
notary
public
and
during
the
lifetime
of
the
decedent,
they
were
living
together
prior
to
the
time
that
the
natural
mother
of
the
infant
died
and
the
father
was
natural
father
was
supporting
the
mother
and
the
infant
and
his
sister.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
originally
in
full
but
shortly
before
he
died,
the
son
having
reached
the
age
of
majority
was
working
for
the
father
in
his
business,
so
the
father
supported
him
in
part.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
he
did
not
do
so
because
he
was
killed.
we
also
do
not
know
whether
that
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
he
was
killed.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
we
don't
know.
there
was
no
will
found
after
he
died.
he
may
have
had
the
will
but
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
he
was
--
no.
he
was
killed
by
a
stepson.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
also
named
lalli.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that
was
aileen's
son
by
another
man.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
there
is
no
--
apparently
there
is
no
birth
certificate
that
we
know
of
about
robert.
we
do
know
that
there
is
an
acknowledgment
which
is
in
the
record
wherein
the
father
says
although
he
could
have
said
my
word,
he
says,
“my
son
in
giving
consent
to
our
marriage
of
robert.”
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
he
was
born
in
new
york.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
we
don't
know
of
any
birth
certificate
for
robert
lalli.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
he
may
have
a
birth
certificate.
we
don't
know
of
any.
there
is
none
in
the
record.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
we
have
not
looked
for
one,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
he
was
born.
there
was
no
question
about
it
he
couldn't
be
the
appellant
in
this
case
and
i
could
not
represent
him
if
he
was
not
born,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
we
feel
that
that
case
is
not
applicable
to
this
situation
in
view
of
gordon
versus
trimble.
we
feel
that
the
gist
of
the
decision
in
gordon
versus
trimble
is
that
where
the
proof
of
paternity
is
clear,
as
in
instances
given
by
the
court
in
gordon
versus
trimble,
no
requirement
should
be
interposed
by
statute
on
the
right
of
illegitimate
child
to
participate
in
the
estate.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
to
that
extent,
yes.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
also
feel
that
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
no.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
bond
of
over
$100,000.00
and
despite
that
there
as
i
reiterate
--
we
also
have
a
claim
in
the
death
action
against
the
man
who
killed
the
decedent
to
this
case.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
yes,
it
is
the
stepson,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
what
the
assets
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
$100,000.00
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
this
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
now,
against
this
claim
there
was
an
acknowledgment
in
any
ground
which
--
therefore
on
this
one
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
she
did
not
appeal
in
this
court.
she
filed
no
brief
and
she's
not
represented
by
her
attorneys
on
this
--
at
this
time.
the
only
one
who's
appearing
in
opposition
to
us
is
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
no.
it
has
not
been
settled,
your
honor.
she
just
did
not
appeal.
she
did
not
file
any
brief
and
she
did
not
appear
although,
after
we
filed
a
notice
of
appealed
for
the
second
time.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
ah,
there
is
--
we
claim
that
there
is
over
a
$100,000.00
involved
in
this
estate.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
we
also
claim
that
there
is
death
cause
of
action
which
he
did
not
follow
up
and
as
to
which
we
say
we
are
entitled
to
an
accounting.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
yes,
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
money
involve
in
this
case.
and
what
the
actual
amount
is
involved
will
find
upon
the
accounting
if
one
is
ordered
by
this
court
and
this
is
what
we
are
seeking
and
that's
where
we
were
stopped
by
the
court
below,
circuit's
court
dismissing
our
application
for
an
accounting.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
no,
if
he
was
the
only
child
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
he
would
get
one-third,
i
mean,
one-half.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
but
if
there
were
more
than
one
child
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
if
there
were
two
children
then
they
will
get
two-thirds
and
the
mother
gets
one-third
but
the
mother
was
--
the
mother
of
this
child
was
dead.
the
respondent
is
not
the
mother
of
the
appellant.
she
is
the
window
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
of
the
decedent.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
she
was
appointed
administrator
as
his
window.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
he
was
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
one-third
to
her
and
two-thirds
to
the
two
children.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
there
is
another
child.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
no,
illegitimate
child
also.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
but
the
one
that
i
represent
and
the
one
who
made
an
application
and
who
is
the
appellant
is
one
of
the
two
children.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
right.
in
addition
to
our
argument
that,
this
case
is
control
by
the
decision
in
trimble
versus
gordon
by
the
fact
that
this,
an
acknowledgment
in
writing,
acknowledged
before
a
notary
which
is
one
of
the
grounds
specified
in
note
14
to
the
gist
of
the
decision
considering
the
language
immediately
preceding
that
note
in
the
text.
we
say,
that
under
the
new
york
law,
section
24
of
the
domestic
relations
law,
creates
two
classes
of
illegitimates.
those
whose
natural
parents
went
to
a
marriage
ceremony
before
or
after
their
birth,
no
matter
how
invalid
is
that
marriage
because
that
section
specifically
says,
“that
if
the
natural
parents
of
an
infant
marry,
regardless
of
how
invalid
that
marriage
is,
that
child
is
a
legitimate
child
of
both
its
parent
who
went
through
that
marriage
ceremony.”
we
say
to
you
that
consequently,
although,
the
court
of
appeals
completely
ignored
our
argument
to
that
respect,
that
section,
when
contrasted
to
section
4-1.2
of
the
decedent's
estate
law
creates
entirely
a
different
class
of
illegitimates.
as
to
those
to
as
to
whom
there
was
a
marriage
ceremony,
even
though
invalid,
they
are
entitled
to
inherit,
but
because
our
client's
parents
complied
with
the
new
york
statute
and
did
not
marry,
our
child
--
our
appellant
is
denied
the
right
to
participate
in
his
father's
estate
because
as
to
him,
the
bar
of
section
4-1.2
is
interposed
and
he
is
held
to
be
illegitimate.
and
i
say
to
your
honors,
that
this
particular
distinction
into
those
two
classes
by
virtue
of
those
two
sections
has
absolute
no
logic,
no
reason,
and
absolutely
is
discriminatory,
and
denies
my
client
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
he
could
not
do
it,
if
your
honor
pleases.
he
could
not
comply
with
the
statutory
requirements
because
this
particular
section
which
is
cited
in
the
opinion,
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
second
appeal
pursuant
to
your
referral
was
not
in
effect
until
long
after
the
father
died.
at
the
time
the
father
was
living,
there
was
no
such
section
and
if
there
was
any
attempt
made
by
the
father
to
bring
the
proceeding
to
get
and
order
of
affiliation
such
an
application
would
have
been
denied
as
it
was
denied
in
matter
of
ricky
m.
versus
sharon
r.,
49
appellate
division
2nd
1035,
and
it
couldn't
be
done
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
yes,
because
the
father
had
a
wife
living
at
the
time,
who
was
the
widow,
the
respondent
in
this
case
who
does
not
appear
on
this
appeal.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that
is
correct,
but
the
statute
section
24
of
the
domestic
relation's
law
specifically
says,
“that
regardless
of
the
validity
of
the
marriage,
even
if
the
marriage
is
not
valid,
even
the
marriage
is
absolutely
no
good,
from
its
inception,
any
child
born
before
or
after
is
a
legitimate
child
of
those
people
who
went
through
a
marriage
ceremony
if
they
are
the
parents
of
that
child,
without
any
proof
or
whatsoever
being
required
of
compliance
with
an
order
of
affiliation
or
any
other
requirements.
the
fact
of
marriage
as
to
those
children
were
there
is,
even
the
bigamous
marriage
is
sufficient
to
make
them
legitimate.”
whereas
to
all
other
children,
where
there
was
no
marriage
bigamous
or
otherwise,
there
is
under
the
new
york
statute
an
absolute
requirement
that
at
the
two
years
of
age,
a
child
should
go
or
his
parents
should
go
and
make
thing
application
for
an
other
affiliation
because
if
that
order
of
affiliation
is
not
a
applied
within
two
years
after
the
child
is
born,
regardless,
even
though
there
was
such
a
situation
as
we
have
in
the
trimble
versus
gordon
case,
that
particular
child,
no
application
having
been
made
within
two
years,
would
not
be
given
a
right
to
participate
in
the
estate
because
that
is
the
provision
of
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
yes,
your
honor,
but
in
gordon
versus
trimble,
this
court
said
that
they
will
does
not
have
to
be
drawn
and
that
that
fact
that
no
will
has
been
drawn
has
no
constitutional
significance
as
to
the
right
of
the
child.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
we
raised
that
question
in
both
of
our
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
because
there
is
no
question
that
no
other
affiliation
was
so
ever
entered
we
now
don't
claim
at
such
an
order
was
entered
we
should
not
attack
two-years
provision.
but
we
say
to
your
honors,
even
if
at
the
age
of
15,
he
got
an
order
affiliation,
assuming
he
did
he
had
such
an
order,
it
wouldn't
have
helped
him
because
he
couldn't
have
participated
in
the
extent
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
but
we
are
challenging
the
statute
on
the
ground
of
gordon
versus
trimble
and
also
because
section
24
of
the
decedent
estate
law
created
two
classes
of
illegitimates
without
any
distinction
between
them,
except
the
fact
of
marriage.
i
will
say
to
you
that
just
because
the
marriage
did
not
take
place,
the
new
york
statute
requires
together
an
order
affiliation
and
which
is
discriminatory.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
in
trimble
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
there
was
a
judicial
determination.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
in
this
case,
there
wasn't.
but
under
note
17,
this
court
said,
“that
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
judicial
determination
and
acknowledgment
is
sufficient
under
the
note
17
to
have
the
same
effect
as
a
judicial
determination.”
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
yes,
that
is
correct.
there
was
none
in
this
particular
case.
i
would
say
that
where
the
proof
is
such
that
it's
clear
that
there
is
no
issue
of
paternity
such
as
here,
where
there
is
an
acknowledgment
and
support
that
there
is
no
requirement
to
have
a
judicial
determination
because
this
is
going
from
the
middle
ground
that
the
court
spoke
up
in
gordon
versus
trimble
to
be
extreme
of
requiring
judicial
determination
within
two
years
after
the
birth
of
the
child
and
no
child
could
have
been
that
smart
to
get
that
determination
at
that
age
or
to
have
the
parents
of
a
child
who
are
living
in
peace
together
to
go
and
apply
all
of
a
sudden
where
the
man
is
supporting
the
woman
and
the
children
for
her
to
going
apply
for
an
order
affiliation.
accordingly,
as
mr.
justice
cook
and
mr.
justice
fagg
would
said,
“this
will
be
serving
only
to
break
up
the
family
for
a
mere
formality
where
there
is
no
reason
why
the
child
is
--
should
have
such
order
applied
for
because
where
the
father
is
voluntarily
supporting
his
children,
then
there
is
no
reason
to
make
a
court
application.”
accordingly,
the
children
of
the
involuntary
parents
or
involuntary
father
will
be
benefited,
but
the
children
of
the
voluntary
father,
who
is
supporting
them,
would
be
denied
the
right
to
support
and
the
right
to
distribution
as
to
their
estates.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
they
were
originally
she
opposed
the
application.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that
was
her
original
position
but
she
admitted
on
the
first
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
issue
involved
was
as
to
whether
or
not
a
child
could
participate
by
raising,
that
was
the
point
that
they
making
their
first
appeal,
when
we
first
won
before
this
court.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
section
522
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
--
of
the
family
court
act
was
amended
to
permit
such
an
application
to
be
made
by
laws
of
1976,
chapter
665,
taking
effect
as
of
january
1,
1977.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
make
such
an
application.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
and
if
he
made
such
an
application
during
his
lifetime
under
the
matter
of
ricky
m.
versus
sharon
r,
49
appellant
division,
2nd
1035
such
application
would
have
been
denied.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
no,
it
is
not,
if
your
honor
please.

case.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
because
there
was
not
provision
in
the
statute
at
that
time
for
the
father
to
make
such
application.
the
statute
was
amended
only
in
1976.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
in
this
man,
he
was
killed
in
1974,
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
they
--
you're
talking
with
reference
to
the
children
born
before
that
time?
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that's
why
were
here,
claiming
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
yes,
the
mother
could
apply
--
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
but
the
mother
wouldn't
--
didn't
apply
because
they
were
living
together
as
one
family.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that's
the
reason
for
it.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
if
the
mother
applied,
if
the
father
who
did
support
her,
and
also,
she
had
to
apply
only
within
two
years
after
the
birth
of
the
child.
the
attorney
general
says
that
if
--
in
gordon
versus
trimble
case,
if
that
case
arose
under
the
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
child
because
there
was
adjudication
would
have
been
entitled
to
inherit.
we
so
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
that
is
not
the
case
because
the
new
york
statute
required
that
that
application
be
made
only
within
the
first
two
years
after
child
was
born.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that
is
not
correct
because
the
necessity
was
not
provided.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
well,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
statute
is
printed
in
the
record
and
it's
in
my
brief
and
it's
the
language
of
that
statute
is
very
clear.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
right.
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that's
exactly
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
so,
when
they
made
that
statement,
they're
not
quoting
the
exact
language
of
the
statute.
as
matter
of
fact,
i
think
there
was
a
note
somewhere
that
they
didn't
reach
that
point.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
the
advanced
--
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
if
your
honor
pleases,
are
printed,
the
first
one
in
appendix
a,
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
75-1148.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
natural
mother
could've
made
the
application.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
so
far
as
--
the
child
yes.
two-year
old
child
could
possibly
do
it
if
he
was
smarter
enough
at
the
age
of
two
to
do
so.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
the
natural
mother
would
not
have
done
it
because
she
was
living
together
with
the
father
and
he
was
supporting
her
and
the
children.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
no.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
her
name
was
lalli
because
she
was
living
with
mr.
lalli.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
that
was
her
name
by
courtesy.
they
were
maintaining
their
household.
he
bought
her
a
house
where
she
lived
together
with
the
two
children
of
this
particular,
what
shall
i
say,
“relationship”
and
in
addition
to
the
child
born
to
her
by
prior
marriage
--
by
prior
relationship
with
some
other
man.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
she
was
living
in
another
house.
mr.
leonard
m.
henkin
thank
you,
your
honor.
