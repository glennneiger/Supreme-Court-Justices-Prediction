justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
henkin,
before
you
start.
would
you
clear
up
something
i
had
missed
in
the
briefs?
you
keep
--
you
mentioned
two
or
three
times
that
mrs.
lalli,
the
original
respondent
is
no
longer
party
to
the
case
in
effect.
is
the
case
moot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
had
been
settled
or
anything
like
that,
has
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me
one
other
thing.
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
you
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun.
he
asked
you
if
there
--
whether
there's
a
lot
of
money
involved
or
small
amount.
you
answered
by
saying
there's
a
$100,000.00
bond
posted
i
don't
really
know
how
that
answers
the
question.
does
that
mean
there's
a
lot
of
money
or
not
much
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
so,
you
do
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
strum
if
we
should
disagree
with
you,
i'm
not
--
don't
know
with
the
court
will
do,
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
requirement
of
affiliation
during
the
lifetime
of
father
is
constitutional.
assume
we
conclude
that
to
be
unconstitutional
then
we
must
squarely
faced
the
two-year
problem,
mustn't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
would
can
see
that
the
two
years
statute
--
well,
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
concede
what
you
in
substance
do,
although
not
quite
in
words
that
the
two-year
provision
is
unreasonable
because
it
retreats
some
illegitimates
irrationally
in
a
different
way
from
other
illegitimates
without
a
irrational
justification.
how
can
you
say
that
and
say
that
the,
say
five
years
after
birth
the
father
dies
and
still
the
child
must
be
barred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
just
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you've
said,
“we
should
assume
that
the
new
york
courts
would
not
enforce
it
because
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
it's
unreasonable,”
that's
the
substance
of
what
you've
said
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
--
general
strum,
let
me
question
you
once
more
about
the
state
interest
that
this
statute
vindicates
and
we're
talking
about
the
requirement
that
the
order
be
obtained
during
the
lifetime
of
the
father.
as
i
understand
that
the
state
interest
is
giving
the
father
the
opportunity
to
deny
parentage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
why,
why
couldn't
you
have
the
normal
rule
you
do
on
the
states
that
claims
to
have
to
be
filed
within
a
limited
period
of
time?
i
don't
understand
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
it
anyway
because
don't
you
occasionally
have
estates
in
which
people
claim
to
be
legitimate
children
that
there
is
a
contest
over
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
have
to
make
that
claim
within
a
specified
period
of
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
couldn't
the
same
rule
take
care
of
this
problem?
for
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
that
with
legitimates
too.
you
have
the
same
things.
let's
focus
for
moment
on
your
--
on
your
primary
interest
i
gather
is
that
you
want
to
give
the
father
the
opportunity
to
deny
parentage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then,
do
you
not
discriminate
against
some
illegitimates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
not
a
standard
of
proof.
this
is
saying
that
no
matter
how
convincing
the
proof,
this
is
standard
of
eligibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
sole
justification
according
to
you
is
to
protect
the
right
of
the
father
to
testify
to
the
contrary
when
the
record
makes
it
clear
he
has
no
such
desire?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
clear
that
you're
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same,
if
you
were
prepared
to
concede
the
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
should
treat
the
legal
issue
as
though
the
facts
were
tantamount
to
be
in
conceded,
realizing
that
they
would
be
challenged
later?
