justice

where
do
you
get
the
judicial
fiat
when
you
got
a
state
statute
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
not
the
decision
of
this
court
that
would
do
it.
it's
the
state
statute
that
would
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
you
want
us
to
do
is
to
find
that
this
state
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
then
dream
up
a
remedy
for
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
i
mean
dream
because
you
haven't
told
us
yet
what
you
want,
have
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
try
it
again
toward
the
end?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
do
you
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
your
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
you
ask
us
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
ask
it
before
right
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
whatever
they
said
you
put
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
have
discovery.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
notice
you
put
great
weight
on
the
fact
that
you
said
embodied
your
complaint
and,
for
other
relief,
you're
not
relying
on
that,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
just
what
i
--
a
minute
ago,
i
used
the
word
"dream
up."
that's
what
you
want
the
court
to
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
are
you
limited
to
that
now
in
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
any
suggestion
from
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
other
than
to
issue
these
injunctions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
else?
that's
--
then
satisfy
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
finnell.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
in
the
area
outside
of
tuscaloosa,
which
we're
talking
about,
the
people
in
a
14
sq.
block
area
say,
"look,
we
haven't
seen
a
policeman
in
the
last
14
years,
and
we
need
some
policemen
here."
how
would
they
go
about
getting
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
they
go
about
getting
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
they
refuse,
what
could
they
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
--
the
people
inside
of
tuscaloosa,
couldn't
they
go
one
step
further
and
say,
"dear
mr.
commissioner
of
police,
if
you
don't
put
them
in
there,
we'll
vote
you
out
of
office"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
they?
and
the
people
outside
could
not
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
a
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they'll
come
out
and
vote
on
it,
a
qualified
registered
voter.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
have
no
authority
at
all
as
to
whether
they
shall
have
good
or
bad
police.
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
people
in
this
area,
and
i
know
they
can
vote
for
federal
and
state
offices,
but
what
local
offices
can
they
vote
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
they
vote
the
same
way
any
other
county
person
would
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
it's
not
in
this
case
and
i
--
but,
why
are
you
interested
in
upholding
this
statute?
it
costs
you
more
than
you
get
out
of
it.
i'm
talking
about
speaking
for
the
city.
