justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
you
go
on,
may
i
ask
your
reaction
to
the
authority
of
the
state
to
authorize
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
limited
to
police
power
and
let's
assume
further
that
there
was
no
power
to
impose
taxes,
merely
the
authority
to
send
the
city
police
into
the
county.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you're
talking
about
speed
limits
and
parking
restrictions?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
what
else,
what
about
criminal
laws
and
city
ordinances?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
different
from
state
criminal
provisions?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i've
seen
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
answer
to
my
question
would
be
the
same
even
if
no
taxes
were
imposed
on
the
residence
of
the
county.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
was
thinking
of
the
license
fees.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
will
you
describe
again
how
the
license
tax
is
measured?
you
mentioned
the
goodrich
company.
how
is
the
amount
of
the
tax
on
it
determined?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
heavy
industry?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
by
volume,
you
mean
gross
sales?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
same
tax
is
applied
to
the
city
except
it's
twice
as
large,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
city
businesses?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
then
you'd
have
a
category
for
commercial
enterprises
and
service
enterprises
and
the
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
same
categories
in
the
city
as
within
this
three-mile
limit?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
no-county
court
separate
and
apart
from
the
courts
that
exercised
jurisdiction
within
the
city,
are
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
are?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
sir?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction
over
the
county
and
city,
both?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
the
same
court
functions
in
both
areas.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
virginia,
we
have
separate
courts
in
the
counties
from
those
in
the
cities,
but
you
have
a
different
system
in
alabama.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
how
about
misdemeanor
and
small
claim
courts?
