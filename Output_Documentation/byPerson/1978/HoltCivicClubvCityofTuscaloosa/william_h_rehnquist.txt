justice
william

you
say,
counsel,
that
the
statute
empowers
and
directs
the
municipal
corporations
of
the
cities
to
do
these
particular
things.
is
that
where
the
--
would
you
make
that
claim
that
it
both
empowers
and
directs
with
respect
to
each
of
the
legislative
activities
that
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
the
city.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page
is
addendum
(b)
in
the
grey
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
said
in
the
second
paragraph
of
the
--
of
section
11,
after
defining
the
police
jurisdiction,
the
second
paragraph
begins
"ordinance
of
a
city
or
town
enforcing
police
or
sanitary
regulations."
can't
that
just
as
readily
be
read
to
read
"choosing
to
enforce
regulations"
as
"being
compelled
to
enforce
regulations"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
can
--
is
the
case
that
interprets
it
that
way
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
of
alabama
provided
that
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
shall
be
governed
by
a
five-man
commission
appointed
by
the
governor
of
alabama
so
that
the
city
--
the
residents
within
the
city
boundaries
of
tuscaloosa
would
have
absolutely
no
say
in
the
composition
of
that
commission.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
due
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that
boils
down
almost
to
an
equal
protection
claim.
if
you
say
that
citizens
in
tuscaloosa
can
vote
but
citizens
in
the
police
jurisdiction
can't
vote,
it
seems
to
me
that's
more
of
an
equal
protection
claim
than
a
due
process
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
were
to
attempt
to
enacts
the
police
jurisdiction,
would
some
sort
of
consent
on
the
part
of
the
residence
in
the
police
jurisdiction
be
required,
some
sort
of
a
referendum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
in
this
situation
the
city
had
sought
to
enacts
the
police
jurisdiction
that
you're
complaining
about
and
the
citizens
in
the
affected
area
had
refused
to
be
enacts.
would
your
case
be
any
different?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
but
doesn't
the
ci
--
doesn't
the
state
of
alabama
have
some
concern
with
the
added
law
enforcement
problems
right
around
the
ring
of
an
urban
area
that
enable
it
to
do
some
things
that
it
might
not
be
able
to
do
way
out
in
the
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
reynolds
against
sims,
could
the
court
have
granted
the
relief
of
relieving
the
city
and
county
of
denver
of
any
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
colorado?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
lucas,
yes.
why
is
that
different
from
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
finnell.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
page
11
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
where
section
9
is
set
out,
in
the
second
sentence
of
that
section
where
it
says
ordinan
--
beginning,
ordinances
of
a
city
or
town
enforcing
police
or
sanitary
regulations,
is
that
construed
in
alabama
as
requiring,
if
a
city
is
going
to
apply
an
ordinance
in
a
police
jurisdiction,
it
must
also
apply
it
in
the
city.
it
can't
apply
it
just
in
the
police
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
could
the
city
con
--
the
converse
of
what
you're
saying,
could
the
city
decide
that
"we
want
to
enforce
a
particular
type
of
ordinance
just
in
the
police
jurisdiction
but
not
in
the
city?"
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
they
certify
the
class
consisting
of
people
within
the
--
presently
within
the
police
jurisdiction
of
tuscaloosa
but
refused
to
class--
certify
a
statewide
class
of
defendants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
still,
one
of
the
cases
you
cited
in
response
to
a
question
from
me
earlier
was
roberson
against
the
city
of
montgomery,
and
i
have
gotten
that
case.
and,
there,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
describes
the
city's
contention
under
section
9,
which
is
the
state
section.
the
city
contends
that
it
has
authority
to
enforce
its
zoning
ordinances
under
section
9.
now,
that
sounds
like
an
enabling
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we're
bound
by
it,
aren't
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
that
if
this
is
nothing
more
than
an
enabling
act,
that
it's
improper
for
a
three-judge
court
to
decide
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
holt,
alabama
is
a
rural
unincorporated
community
located
just
outside
the
corporate
limits
of
tuscaloosa,
alabama
but
within
tuscaloosa's
three-mile
police
jurisdiction.
residents
of
holt
and
an
incorporated
civic
association
brought
this
suit
alleging
that
alabama
statutes
subjecting
police
jurisdiction
residents
to
tuscaloosa's
police
and
sanitary
regulations
to
the
criminal
jurisdiction
of
tuscaloosa's
court
and
to
the
city's
power
to
license
businesses
without
also
extending
to
police
jurisdiction
residents
the
right
to
vote
in
municipal
elections
violated
their
rights
under
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama
concluded
the
alabama
statutes
were
not
unconstitutional
and
granted
appellee's
motion
to
dismiss.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
because
alabama's
police
jurisdiction
statutes
have
stated
application.
the
three-judge
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
consider
appellant's
constitutional
claims.
on
the
merits,
this
court's
decisions
have
uniformly
recognized
that
a
government
unit
may
legitimately
restrict
the
right
to
participate
in
its
political
processes
to
those
who
reside
within
its
borders.
residents
of
tuscaloosa's
police
jurisdiction
do
not
reside
within
the
city's
corporate
limits
and
therefore
have
no
right
to
vote
in
municipal
elections.
appellants
are
therefore
not
entitled
to
invoke
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
which
has
been
held
to
be
applicable
in
previous
voting
rights
decisions
of
this
court.
they
are
however
like
any
other
litigant
entitled
to
claim
that
alabama
statute
permitting
tuscaloosa
to
enforce
some
of
its
ordinances
within
the
police
jurisdiction
denies
them
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
we
conclude
however
that
alabama's
police
jurisdiction
statutes
are
rationally
related
to
the
state's
interest
in
affording
municipalities
some
measure
of
control
over
activities
conducted
just
beyond
their
corporate
limits
and
ensuring
that
police
jurisdiction
residents
do
not
go
without
basic
municipal
services
such
as
police,
fire,
and
health
protection.
alabama
statute
here
challenge
does
not
therefore
deny
appellants
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
because
it
does
not
do
so
appellants
likewise
state
no
separate
claim
under
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
they
are
denied
the
franchise.
