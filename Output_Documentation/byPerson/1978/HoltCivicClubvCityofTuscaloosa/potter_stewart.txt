justice

stewart
it's
descriptive
in
other
words.
justice
potter
stewart
any
ordinances
falling
into
those
categories
are
effective
and
within
the
extraterritorial
police
jurisdiction
of
the
municipality.
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
way
the
statute
has
been
interpreted
in
alabama.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
arisen
a
good
many
times.
i
think,
before
i
came
in
the
bench
this
morning,
i
glanced
over
and
i
--
it's
not
an
article,
it's
a
comment
in
the
chicago
law
review
of
last
fall,
in
which
it
has
pointed
out
that
some-35
states
have
this
sort
of
system,
in
whole
or
in
part,
and
that
it
dated
back
to
the
late
19th
century
and
that,
repeatedly,
due
process
attacks
on
extraterritorial
government
by
municipalities
were
rejected.
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
it
isn't
quite
so
obvious
as
you
indicate.
justice
potter
stewart
the
article
went
on
to
say,
i
should
say,
if
--
in
your
behalf
that,
in
the
ling
of
the
modern
developments
of
the
equal
protection
law,
the
result
might
be
quite
different.
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
the
early
years
of
this
century
anyway.
justice
potter
stewart
you
rely
primarily
on
the
reapportionment
cases
in
this
court,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and,
in
kramer,
the
complaint
was
that
that
unmarried
man,
if
that's
what
he
was,
was
not
allowed
to
a
vote
in
a
school
board
election.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
school
board
election
in
the
state
of
new
york,
as
i
remember
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
he
asked
for
in
his
complaint
was
that
he
be
allowed
to
vote,
wasn't
he
--
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
going
to
be
taxed
if
the
tax
levy
or
bond
issue
was
passed
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
a
tenant,
as
i
remember.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
may
remember
i
dissented
in
that
case,
so
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
but,
in
any
event,
the
relief
he
was
asking
was
that
he
be
allowed
to
vote.
now,
the
relief
you're
asking
is
that
this
whole
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
be
held
to
be
totally
invalid,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
in
any
event,
those
cases
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
constitutional
injury
perceived
by
the
court
was
in
prohibiting
those
plaintiffs
from
voting.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
that
was
the
constitutional
injury.
now,
you
don't
allege
any
such
constitutional
injury.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
still,
you're
not
asking
for
redress
for
that
constitutional
injury.
you're
not
allow
--
asking
that
you
be
allowed
to
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
lucas
--
justice
potter
stewart
lucas
against
44th
general
assembly.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
lawsuit
is
analogous
to
what
those
voting
cases
and
reapportionment
cases
would
have
been
had
the
plaintiff
in
the
reapportionment
cases
said
this
legislature
is
mal-apportioned,
therefore,
anything
it
does
is
null
and
void.
it's
an
invalid
legislature,
and
the
court,
at
least
by
some
reaction,
has
declined
to
accept
the
proposition
that
a
mal-apportioned
legislature
cannot
legislate.
justice
potter
stewart
we've
had
cases,
for
example,
where
a
mal-apportioned
legislature
has
enacted
laws
and
those
laws
are
attacked
as
invalid
because
they
were
enacted
by
an
unconstitutional
legislature
and
the
court,
i
don't
remember
any
opinions
dealing
with
it
in
a
plenary
way,
but
the
court,
at
least
by
some
reaction,
has
rejected
those
claims.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
sought
to
ask
this
court
to
hold
constitutionally
invalid
state
laws
enacted
by
concededly
mal-apportioned
legislatures.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
often,
the
remedy
identifies
the
constitutional
injury
about
which
you're
complaining?
justice
potter
stewart
well--
so,
the
--
if
the
constitutional
injury
is
that
you're
not
being
allowed
to
vote
then
the
redress
for
that
injury
is
that
you
be
allowed
to
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
no
taxes
involved
here.
justice
potter
stewart
license
fees.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood,
mr.
finnell,
of
course
--
justice
potter
stewart
police
power
has
at
least
two
meanings.
there's
the
constitutional
meaning
of
meaning
the
state's
reserve
power
to
enact
legislation
within
its
appropriate
--
within
the
appropriate
reserve
powers
of
the
states
and
that's
often
compendiously
known
as
the
police
power
of
a
state.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
my
brother
powell's
to
--
question
to
be
more
limited
that
is,
supposed
it
had
been
confined
only
to
sending
the
city
policemen
out
there,
and
that's
quite
a
much
more
limited
concept
and
was
pointed
out
by
your
brother
on
the
other
side
that
this
would
involve
also
the
extension
of
legisla
--
of
the
city's
legislative
power
out
into
the
police
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
say
this
is
confined
to
the
police
power,
you're
perfectly
accurate
and,
if
that
term
is
understood
as
being
the
appropriate
power
of
the
municipality
to
govern
itself,
it's
only
part
of
the
police
power
that
is
extended
but
it's
certainly
much
more
than
simply
sending
the
city
policemen
out
there
to
enforce
the
law,
the
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
extension
of
the
legislative
power
the
municipality
beyond
its
territorial
limits.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
county
police
force?
i
suppose
a
county
sheriff.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
county
police
have
--
do
they
have
jurisdiction
within
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
countywide
including
within
the
city.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
matter
of
practical
division
of
labor.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
do
have
jurisdiction
in
the
city.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
there
a
state
police
force?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
state
police
force?
justice
potter
stewart
only
highway
patrol.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
--
does
it
--
its
name
seems
to
imply
that
it
has
jurisdiction
only
of
traffic
offenses.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
how
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
familiar
with
the
state
of
ohio
which
is
very
careful.
it
does
not
have
a
state
police
force.
it
has
a
state
highway
patrol
with
very
limited
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
specialized.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
no
general
state
police
force,
as
you
--
i
understand
you
to
say.
justice
potter
stewart
but
its
name
certainly
doesn't
indicate
that
it's
a
general
police
force.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
it
does.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
does.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
cannot
exceed
the
cost
of
providing
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it
cannot
exceed
the
cost
of
providing
it
and,
in
no
event,
it
can
be
--
can
it
be
more
than
half
of
what
a
city
resident
is
charged.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
are
you,
like
your
friend
on
the
other
side,
going
to
rely
on
your
brief
or
the
--
your
argument
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
has
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
the
single
district
court
judge,
of
course,
held
that
this
was
not
a
case
for
a
three-judge
court.
he
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
nonetheless,
that
question
is
still
open
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
particularly,
was
--
that
was
pointed
out
by
the
court's
order.
didn't
we
postpone
consideration
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
whether
or
not
we
have
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
have,
we
have
no
option.
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
don't,
we
also
have
no
option.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
single
district
court
judge,
whoever
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
judge
mc
faton
held
very
clearly,
in
a
long
discussion
in
the
opinion
that's
set
out
in
the
appendix
--
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
excuse
me,
that
this
was
not
a
case
for
a
three-judge
court,
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
not,
then
this
court
doesn't
have
direct
appellate
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes,
but
you
know
what
he
said
as
well
as
i
do,
or
if
not
better.
he
said
that
this
was
not
a
law
of
statewide
application.
it
was
no
more
than
an
enabling
act.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
this
isn't
a
question
of
standing.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
