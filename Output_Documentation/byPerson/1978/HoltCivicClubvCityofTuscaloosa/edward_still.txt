mr.
edward
still
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
was
heard
by
a
three-judge
district
court
which
was
empanelled
to
hear
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
an
alabama
statute
which
empowers
and
directs
each
city
in
town
in
alabama
to
exercise
its
police
power
within
a
one-and-a
half
or
three-mile
zone
around
the
city
or
the
town.
the
adverse
decision
of
the
district
court
against
the
plaintiffs
was
appealed
to
this
court
under
28
usc
section
1253.
the
court
reserved
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
we
have
briefed
that
extensively.
and,
if
the
court
does
not
have
any
further
questions
on
that
point,
i'll
move
on
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
still
the
statute
was
passed
in
the
early
1900s,
one
of
them,
a
second
one
was
--
i
believe
it
was
1907.
a
second
one
was
passed
in
1927,
and
i'm
not
sure
about
the
third
one.
mr.
edward
still
they
are
old.
mr.
edward
still
you
mean
the
legislative
activities
of
the
city
or
the
three
statutes?
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
it
does
because
section
11-40-10
which
is
the
primary
police
jurisdiction
statute,
contained
in
addendum
(b)
to
the
brief,
the
grey
brief,
says
that
ordinances
of
the
city
or
town
shall
have
force
and
effect
in
the
limits
of
the
city
or
town
and
so,
that
is
a
mandatory
statement
there
and
i
believe
that
they
would
have
effect
whether
the
city
intended
them
to
or
not.
now,
city
force
might
choose
not
to
send
its
police
out,
but
i
believe
that
it
is
mandatory
under
state
law.
mr.
edward
still
it
is
about
three
pages
from
the
back
of
the
grey
brief,
your
honor.
it
is,
i
believe,
(b)
(1)
is
the
page.
mr.
edward
still
of
the
grey
brief,
your
honor,
of
the
brief
of
the
appellants.
that
contains
the
new
language
of
the
statutes.
there's
been
a
recompilation
of
the
alabama
code
since
we
originally
filed
the
suit,
but
the
text
of
the
statutes
has
not
changed
materially.
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that
statute
has
been
interpreted
in
alabama
as
defining
a
class
of
statutes.
police
ordinances
and
sanitary
ordinances
are
two
classes
of
ordinances.
other
types
might
be
financial
regulations
of
the
city,
internal
regulations
of
the
city,
for
one
reason
or
other,
or
zoning
regulations.
under
alabama
law,
zoning
regulations
are
not
police
ordinances
and
so,
in
that
way,
this
is
a
way
of
differentiating
police
and
sanitation
regulation,
sanitary
regulations
from,
say,
zoning
regulations
or
other
types
of
ordinances
that
would
not
have
an
extraterritorial
effect.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
it
is
descriptive
of
a
class
of
ordinances.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
we
cite
both
the
city
of
montgomery
versus
roberson
case
and
white
versus
city
of
decatur.
city
of
montgomery
versus
roberson
was
a
case
that
dealt
with
the
power
of
the
city
of
montgomery
to
zone
in
its
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
went
into
statutory
construction
in
great
lengths
there
to
explain
that
these
were
just
ways
of
describing
certain
classifications
of
ordinances
and
that
zoning
was
not
a
police
power
within
the
normal
meaning
of
the
term
as
far
as
cities
go
because
we
had
to
pass
a
special
law
allowing
cities
to
zone
in
alabama.
it
was
not
considered
to
be
in
the
normal
grant
of
powers
to
cities
by
the
state
of
alabama.
the
case
alleged
both
due
process
and
equal
protection
grounds
in
the
original
complaint.
we
have
briefed
the
question
of
due
process
and
you
will
notice
that
we
have
cited
only
two
cases,
and
that
is
united
states
versus
texas
and
united
states
versus
alabama,
judge
johnson's
concurring
opinion
there.
the
question
of
due
process
is
so
fundamental
that
it
generally
has
not
had
to
be
raised
in
voting
rights
cases
and,
yet,
if
we
think
about
it,
the
process
that
is
due
to
all
of
these
citizens
is
that
if
they
are
governed,
they
should
be
allowed
to
have
some
voice
in
the
government
over
them.
the
question
is
usually
not
presented
to
this
court
in
a
due
process
context,
but
i
believe
that
it
should
be
in
this
case
because
even
ignoring
a
comparison
between
the
--
what
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
does
to
its
citizens
and
what
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
does
to
the
people
in
the
police
jurisdiction,
the
fundamental
question
under
due
process
would
be
what
should
it
do
to
the
people
in
the
police
jurisdiction
if
it
does
not
allow
them
to
vote.
it
is
--
mr.
edward
still
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
because,
in
that
case,
the
city
--
the
state
would
have
essentially
abolished
local
government
except
through
commissioners
of
some
sort,
agents
that
it
appointed
from
the
central
government.
it
has
done
that
in
the
past
with
the
port
of
mobile
in
the
late
1800s.
i
think
that
would
be
a
fundamentally
different
situation
here
than
one
in
which
there
is
a
local
government
which
is
elected
and
in
which
these
people
are
not
allowed
to
participate.
the
boundary
between
the
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
which
it
is
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
and
that
is
the
question
that
we
have
briefed
most
extensively
but,
as
i
said,
the
question
usually
does
not
arise
even
that
it's
a
due
process
claim,
but
we
have
raise
that
in
this
case
and
i
think
it
is
a
sufficient
grounds.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
they
were.
mr.
edward
still
well,
i
was
talking
about
a
more
recent
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
it
might.
most
of
those
challenges
were
raised,
as
you
point
out,
in
the
late
1800s
at
a
time
when
we
didn't--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
or
the
early
part
of
this
century.
the
equal
protection
questions
is,
i
think,
a
fundamental
one
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
as
the
chicago
law
review
comment
pointed
out,
there
are
35
states
that
has
some-sort
of
extraterritorial
power
for
their
cities.
only
four
states:
alabama,
montana,
north
dakota,
and
south
dakota
have
full
police
power
extraterritorial
jurisdictions.
the
rest
of
them
allow
some
sort
of
zoning
or
some
sort
of
business
regulation
or
nuisance
regulation
in
an
extraterritorial
zone,
but
the
full-fledged
police
jurisdiction
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
only
in
four
states.
the
equal
protection
question,
first
of
all,
the
first
mater
that
we
get
to
in
that
regard
is,
what
is
the
proper
standard
of
review?
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
has
raised
the
point
that
the
--
only
a
rational
relationship
must
be
shown
between
the
means
and
the
end
that
the
state
has
chosen,
and
they
cite
for
authority
on
that
point
salyer
land
co.
versus
tulare
water
storage
district.
that
case
utilize
such
a
test,
a
rational
relationship
test,
rather
than
a
strict
scrutiny
test
because
this
court
first
determined
that
the
tulare
district
was
not
a
general
purpose
government
and,
therefore,
the
strict
scrutiny
rule
did
not
apply
because
it
was
not
really
the
right
to
vote
in
the
fundamental
sense,
that
we
know
it,
that
was
involved
in
the
case.
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
is
not
such
a
limited
purpose
government
in
the
police
jurisdiction.
the
only
things
the
city
cannot
do
in
the
police
jurisdiction
that
it
can
do
in
the
city
limits
of
tuscaloosa
is
collect
ad
valorem
property
taxes
and
to
zone,
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago.
it
may
also
collect
only
one-half
of
the
usual
license
fee
that
it
charges
inside
the
city.
mr.
edward
still
some
sort
of
consent
is
required
under
alabama
law,
your
honor.
the
statutes
provide
for
three
or
four
different
methods,
each
one
of
them
either
requires
a
referendum
among
the
affected
voters
residence
of
a
particular
area
or
their
consent
on
a
petition.
there
are
different
statutes
for
different
cities,
but
every
one
of
them
requires
both
the
consent
of
the
city
and
the
consent
of
the
affected
voters
in
a
particular
area.
now,
in
some
cases,
there
are
additional
requirements.
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
so.
the
city
is
constantly
growing.
as
the
city
has
pointed
out
in
their
brief,
it's
grown
about
quintupled
in
size
over
the
last
25
years
or
so.
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
case
is
any
different
if
these
people
had
been
given
a
choice
about
whether
they
wanted
to
be
in
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
and
chose
not
to
be
because
they
are
still
treated
differently
than
the
people
in
the
city
of
tuscaloosa.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
the
state
may
have
a
legitimate
concern.
but,
either
under
the
rational
relationship
test
or
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
we've
got
to
look
at
the
end
that
they're
seeking
which
is
protection
of
these
people
from
marauders
of
various
sorts
by
the
police
and
the
means
that
they
chose
to
do
so.
the
means
that
they
have
chosen
to
use
in
this
particular
case
are
to
allow
a
different
government
that
these
people
do
not
have
a
vote
in
to
govern
them,
and
that's
the
due
pro
--
that's
the
equal
protection
question
and
he
due
process
question.
we're
not
attacking
the
end
of
the
regulation,
the
state
saying
that
these
people
need
some
sort
of
protection.
we
are
simply
attacking
the
means
by
which
they
have
done
it
because,
as
the
chicago
law
review
article
or
comment
pointed
out,
there
are
many
different
ways
in
which
these
people
who
live
in
areas
right
outside
cities
could
be
governed.
as
i
pointed
out,
46
states
do
not
have
the
type
of
jurisdiction
that
we're
talking
about
in
alabama.
so,
they
have
figured
out
some
way
to
protect
these
people
without
depriving
them
of
the
right
to
vote
by
the
government
that
is
supposedly
protecting
them.
there
are
15
states
that
have
no
sort
of
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
at
all.
they
utilize
such
things
as
township
governments
or
direct
police
protection
by
the
county
government.
now,
i
think
those
things
could
be
used
in
alabama
under
the
alabama
constitution,
not
--
perhaps
not
townships
per
se,
but
direct
government
by
the
county
government
could
be
used.
mr.
edward
still
not
so
much
the
reapportionment
cases,
your
honor,
but
that
line
of
cases
beginning
with
kramer
versus
union
free
school
district
which
are
not
so
much
reapportionment
cases
as
they
are
voting
rights
cases.
mr.
edward
still
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
he
was
seeking
the
right
to
vote
in
that
particular
case.
that's
because
that
was
the
only
practical
remedy.
no
matter
what
he
did,
there
was
no
way
he
could
isolate
himself
from
the
pervasive
effects
of
a
school
in
our
society
today.
that
was
the
whole
basis
of
the
court's
decision.
mr.
edward
still
well,
he
was
going
to
be
taxed
indirectly.
he
did
not
own
any
property
to
be
taxed.
mr.
edward
still
that's
right.
he
lived
with
his
parents
and
he
was
a
non-property
owner.
mr.
edward
still
and
so
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
that's
correct,
and
that's
because
we
have
a
choice
in
this
case
which
no
one
else
has
had
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
kramer,
as
i
said,
didn't
have
any
practical
way
to
pull
himself
out
of
society
and
say
the
schools
aren't
going
to
affect
me.
cipriano
in
the
city
of
phoenix
case
was
going
to
be
affected
by
the
utility
rates
no
matter
what
he
did.
as
long
as
he
was
hooked
up
in
--
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
city's
utilities,
he
was
going
to
be
paying
for
the
bond
issue
that
the
property
owners
were
passing.
in
evans
versus
cornman,
the
only
practical
thing
to
do
was
to
extend
the
right
to
vote
to
those
people
who
lived
out
at
the
nih
enclave
in
montgomery
county,
maryland
because
if
you
had
said
“well,
maryland
must
withdraw
their
authority
over
them,
you
would've
had
to
have
declared
unconstitutional
the
federal
assimilative
crimes
act
and
several
other
federal
acts,
an
entire
federal
scheme
of
regulation.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
we
allege
the
flip
side
of
that
because
these
residents
of
the
holt
area
are
not
allowed
to
vote,
they
--
and,
they
are
governed
then
they
are
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right.
now,
we
have
a
choice
--
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir.
we
did
not
ask
for
that
in
the
complaint,
but
i
think
that
the
court
--
district
court
could
have
granted
that
particular
relief
if
it
had
found
that
we
have
stated
a
cause
of
action.
i
think
that
it
also,
as
a
practical
matter,
could
have
granted
the
relief
that
we
sought
because
that
relief
would
actually
be
less
disruptive
of
the
state's
regulatory
system
than
would
extending
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
that
they
could.
mr.
edward
still
yes.
mr.
edward
still
because,
in
this
particular
case,
if
we
remove
the
city
of
tuscaloosa's
jurisdiction
over
these
people,
they
will
still
be
governed
by
the
county
of
tuscaloosa
and
by
the
state
of
alabama
and,
yet,
they
will
not
be
governed
by
the
city
of
tuscaloosa.
so,
we
actually
have
a
practical
choice
that
could
be
made
in
this
case
between
the
remedies.
but,
as
i
say,
if
the
district
court
had
found
that
we've
stated
the
cause
of
action,
had
allowed
us
to
go
to
trial
and
it
found
that
we
prevailed,
it
could
have
ordered
a
remedy
of
saying
we
declare
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
and
we
give
the
state
legislature
one
year
to
come
up
with
a
new
statute,
and
if
it
doesn't,
then
we
will
undertake
to
do
something
ourselves.
in
much
the
same
way
that
many
times
reapportioning
courts
have
done
so,
they've
declared
the
present
scheme
unconstitutional
and
then
deferred
to
the
state
legislature
to
do
so
and,
in
fact,
this
court
requires
it
to
do
so
if
at
all
practical.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
and,
in
those
cases
in
which
people
actually
did
claim
that
a
mal-apportioned
legislature
did
not
have
the
power
to
legislate
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
but
in
many
of
those
case
--
reapportionment
cases,
the
--
i
believe
the
plaintiffs,
in
addition,
sought
to
have
the
present
legislature
just
removed
from
office
immediately
and
that--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
just
because
you
ask
for
the
wrong
remedy
in
your
initial
complaint,
doesn't
mean
that
that
complaint
is
invalid.
if
you
state
a
cause
of
action
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
and
we
have
identified
the
constitutional
injury
as
these
people
being
governed
and
not
being
allowed
to
vote.
mr.
edward
still
it
may
be
that
the
court
--
the
district
court
will
hold
that.
it
may
be
that
this
court
will
hold
that.
we
will
accept
that
kind
of
remedy
because,
i
think,
if
it
happen
that
the
state
of
tusca
--
that
the
state
of
alabama
would
remedy
that
situation
very
quickly
by
passing
a
new
statute,
probably
abolishing
the
police
jurisdiction,
but
there
are
approximately
16,000
people
who
live
in
the
police
jurisdiction
of
tuscaloosa.
there
are
116,000
--
excuse
me,
there
are
70,000
people
who
live
in
the
city
of
tuscaloosa.
we're
talking
about
expanding
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
by
one-fourth,
approximately,
by
judicial
fiat
if
you
hold
that
these
people
have
the
right
to
vote.
we
say
it
would
be
much
less
disruptive
--
mr.
edward
still
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
but
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
but
i'm
saying
that
the
court
has
a
choice.
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir,
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
i
have.
we
have
asked
that
the
--
mr.
edward
still
i
have
asked
that
the
city's
jurisdiction
over
these
people
who
do
not
live
inside
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
be
removed
from
them,
that
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
are
not
being
allowed
to
govern
them.
mr.
edward
still
you
simply
tell
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
they
can't
send
their
police
into
that
area
anymore
and
they
can
enforce
the
order.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
you
could.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
the
original
complaint
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
the
original
complaint,
if
you'll
look
in
the
complaint,
it
asked
that
an
injunction
be
issued
to
--
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
the
police
jurisdiction
statute,
the
main
police
jurisdiction
statute,
and
declaring
two
additional
police
jurisdiction
statutes
to
be
unconstitutional.
it
doesn't
ask
that
they'd
be
enjoined
because
believe
that
they
are
dependent
upon
the
main
police
jurisdiction
statute.
mr.
edward
still
we
have
never
been
allowed
to
put
any
evidence
on
in
this
case.
it
was
dismissed
by
a
single-judge
district
court.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
the
case,
sent
it
back
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
district
court.
the
three-judge
district
court
then
dismissed
on
another
motion
to
dismiss.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
file
in
this
case
and
the
record
in
this
case
because
we
didn't
take
discovery
and,
presumably,
the
district
court
did
look
at
that,
but
it
never
mentioned
it
in
its
particular
opinion.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
we
did
take
discovery.
the
case
was
pending
for
three
years
in
the
district
court
in
two
different
times.
mr.
edward
still
that,
your
honor,
is
a
standard
way
of
doing
things
in
alabama
but,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
federal
rules
of
federal
procedure
allow
the
court
to
grant
such
other
relief
as
it
may
find
proper.
if
we
have
stated
a
cause
of
action
before
we
get
to
the
"where
for"
--
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir.
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
dream
up.
i
ask
for
a
specific
remedy
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
it
were
limited
to
that
because
i
think,
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
court
is
allowed
whether
i
ask
for
such
other
further
equitable
relief
as
may
be
granted.
i
think
the
court
is
allowed
to
fashion
such
a
remedy
as
would
be
equitable
in
the
situation.
mr.
edward
still
i
believe
that
i
--
mr.
edward
still
i
have
some
right
to
make
suggestions,
but
if
the
court
finds
that
i'm
only
entitled
to
(a)
and
i
ask
for
(b),
but
(a)
is
encompassed
within
the
cause
of
action
that
i
ask
for,
that
they
will
grant
that
sort
of
thing.
there
are
many
cases
in
which
people
will
ask
for
injunctions
which,
for
one
reason
or
another,
might
be
barred
by
equitable
principles
or
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
eleventh
amendment
or
something
like
that.
so,
instead
of
issuing
a
mandatory
injunction
that
says
to
the
state
"spend
money,"
the
court
come
back
and
says
"don't
do
this
unless
you
do
something
constitutional."
they
issue
a
prohibitory
injunction.
mr.
edward
still
i
want
this
court
specifically
to
reverse
the
case
and
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
which
would
then
issue
the
injunctions
and
declare
two
statutes
unconstitutional
and
enjoin
the
third
statute
from
being
enforced.
mr.
edward
still
that
would
be
sufficient,
your
honor.
that
would
be
sufficient.
if
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
i
am,
unless
--
but
i'm
certainly
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
answer
questions
if
anyone
has
any
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
edward
still
well,
your
honor,
it's
a
little
bit
more
than
just
sending
the
police.
they
also
get
to
enforce
their
particular
ordinances.
so,
they
get
to
choose
--
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
gets
to
choose
what
will
be
enforced,
what
will
be
imposed
upon
the
residents
of
the
police
jurisdiction.
so,
in
that
way,
they
can
impose
not
only
their
police
force,
their
agency,
but
they
could
also
impose
their
will
upon
these
people.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
that
sort
of
thing
and
all
sorts
of
business
regulations.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
they
are
quasi-criminal
ordinances,
is
what
they're
called
in
alabama.
i
never
had
exactly
understood
the
distinction.
you
still
go
to
jail.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
some
of
them
are.
for
instance,
in
alabama,
just
to
take
an
off-hand
example,
it's
not
--
prostitution
is
not
illegal
under
alabama
law,
but
prostitution
is
illegal
under
tuscaloosa
city
ordinances.
it's
illegal
to
solicit
for
prostitution
under
alabama
law.
it's
illegal
to
keep
a
body
house,
but
it's
not
illegal
to
be
a
prostitute
or
to
actually
engage
in
an
act
of
prostitution.
so,
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
gets
to
impose
its
will
upon
these
people
in
an
area
that
would
not
otherwise
be
governed.
they've
got
solicitation
ordinances
about
charities.
we've
got
an
appendix
to
the,
i
believe,
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
edward
still
which
list
all
of
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
which,
in
effect
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
i
believe
so
because
the
police
power
is
so
pervasive.
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir,
there
are
no
taxes.
there
are
some
license
fees
that
are
collected.
mr.
edward
still
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
still
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
mr.
edward
still
the
law,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
beginning
of
my
argument,
requires
that
each
city
enforce
its
police
ordinances
and
sanitary
ordinances
in
the
police
jurisdiction.
it
is
not
simply
an
enabling
statute.
it
is
a
statue
which
requires
that
this
be
done
statewide.
every
city
in
the
state
of
alabama,
every
town
in
the
state
of
alabama
must
enforce
its
police
powers
in
that
police
jurisdiction
zone.
mr.
edward
still
well,
as
i
point
out,
your
honor,
that
may
be
a
poor
choice
of
words
on
the
part
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
i
think
the
question
--
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
the
question
presented
in
the
roberson
case
was
whether
or
not
zoning
is
included
within
the
term
"police
power,"
and
so
--
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir,
i
do
not
because
i
believe
even
an
enabling
act
--
i
believe
that
the
complaint,
fairly
read
on
its
face,
shows
that
the
statute
is
being
enforced
or
is
being
utilized
by
numerous
jurisdictions
around
the
state
of
alabama
and
i
don't
think
we
have
the
factual
controversy.
it's
never
been
put
in
into
contention
by
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
either
through
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
through
an
answer
which
has
never
been
filed
in
this
case,
that
this
does
not
have
a
statewide
impact.
this
is
not
like
the
case
of
board
of
regents
versus
new
left
project
in
which
the
regulation,
on
its
very
face,
only
applied
to
the
texas
regent
system
and
not
to
the
other
colleges
and
universities
around
the
state.
i
appreciate
the
court's
attention.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
still
they
are
getting
some
services,
your
honor,
which
perhaps
might
be
less
than
if
they
were
in
the
c
--
costing
them
less
than
if
they
were
in
the
city
of
tuscaloosa.
mr.
edward
still
that,
it
would
be.
but,
they
are
not
allowed
to
vote,
and
they
consider
that
deprivation
of
the
right
to
vote
and,
at
the
same
time,
the
imposition
of
the
government
over
them
to
be
a
commodity
that
doesn't
have
a
particular
price.
mr.
edward
still
something
like
that,
your
honor.
i've
tried
to
stay
away
from
revolutionary
war
rodrick
in
this
case,
but
it's
something
like
that.
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir.
and,
i
say,
your
honor,
my
clients
made
a
choice
about
which
they
wanted
and
just
as
--
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir,
we
pointed
that
out
and
if
you'll
read
paragraph
10
of
the
complaint,
we
specifically
say
"we
are
denied
the
right
to
vote."
and
then,
we
say
in
paragraph
11
--
mr.
edward
still
no,
in
paragraph
11,
it
says
"the
denial
does
such
and
such."
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
still
paragraph
10
says
people
who
live
in
the
police
jurisdiction
are
denied
the
right
to
vote,
denied
the
right
to
participate
in
referenda,
initiatives
and
recalls,
that
sort
of
thing
that
are
allowed
to
other
citizens
in
the
city
of
tuscaloosa.
paragraph
11
goes
on
to
say,
as
a
consequence
of
that
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
and
the
--
mr.
edward
still
i
believe
that
we
do,
your
honor,
because
we
say
that
not
being
allowed
to
vote
and
being
governed
is
the
conflict
that
creates
the
constitutional
problem
in
this
case.
thank
you.
