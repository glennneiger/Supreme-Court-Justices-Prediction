chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
77-515,
holt
civic
club
against
the
city
of
tuscaloosa.
mr.
still,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
your
first
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
still,
when
the
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
as
you've
already
observed,
it
indicated
that
four
justices
had
enough
doubt
about
jurisdiction
so
as
to
postpone
the
resolution,
and
you
have
elected
to
submit
that
on
the
brief.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
you're
content
to
do
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
finnell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
has
puzzled
me
a
little
bit,
mr.
finnell.
ordinarily,
these
days,
people
are
complaining
about
too
much
cost
for
too
little
service
in
terms
of
taxes.
here,
these
people
are
getting
a
rather
expensive
amount
of
governmental
service
without
paying
for
it.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
decide
the
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
a
liquor
license
or
any
other
license
is
granted
where
the
location
becomes
a
factor
and
you
say
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
reserves
the
right
to
issue
that
license,
does
the
county
licensing
process
get
into
the
fixing
of
the
location,
too,
or
just
the
city?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
budget
of
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
segregate
and
identify
the
cost
of
the
taxpayers
of
tuscaloosa
to
provide
these
services
for
the
appellants
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
being
no
record
on
that
in
this
case,
is
that
a
matter
the
court
could
or
did
take
notice
of
judicially
as
to
how
much
services
these
people
were
getting
for
nothing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
can
take
the
court
--
the
district
court
could
have
taken
judicial
notice
of
the
budgets
of
tuscaloosa.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
among
other
things.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
back-handed
reference.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
understood
the
question
to
be
directed
at
the
possibility,
if
not
the
probability,
that
many
of
the
people
in
this
area
would
not
want
the
result
sought
by
the
appellant
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
finnell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
--
even
though
you've
waived
it,
i'd
like
to
have
your
comment
on
the
lack
of
pervasive
statewide
impact
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
just
a
question
for
you,
which
i
suggest
you
need
not
answer
if
you
don't
want
to
and
you
won't
be
prejudiced
for
not
answering.
as
i
suggested
to
your
friend,
most
of
the
complaint
these
days
about
government
are
paying
too
much
and
getting
too
little.
and,
here,
the
people
of
this
--
that
you
report
to
represent
here,
that
you
do
represent,
and
the
others
in
that
area
are
getting
a
lot
of
free
services,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
may
have
to
pay
twice
as
much
for
the
licenses,
for
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
a
little
bit
like
george
iii,
running
the
area
from
a
distance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
holt
civic
club
and
others
against
the
city
of
tuscaloosa
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
