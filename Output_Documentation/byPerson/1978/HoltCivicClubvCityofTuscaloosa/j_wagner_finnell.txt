mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
i
first
would
like
to
more
fully
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
had
been
proposed
by
this
court.
for
instance,
the
--
mr.
justice
powell
asked
the
question
"suppose
this
will
confine
two
police
powers
in
the
extraterritorial
aspect."
well,
i
say
that
it
is
so
confined
because,
well,
it's
police
insani
--
ordinances
of
a
police
insanitary
nature,
maybe
effective
both
within
the
city
and
within
the
police
jurisdiction.
i
know,
really,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
court,
the
municipal
court
which
is
the
same
as
the
district
court
in
all
respects,
has
jurisdiction
out
in
this
area,
and
that
may
be
an
aspect
of
police
power
but
it
--
other
than
that,
i
know
of
no
other
powers
that
are
granted
in
the
police
jurisdiction.
as
the
court,
some
of
the
members,
have
pointed
out,
there's
no
authority
to
tax.
there's
no
authority
to
charge
a
business
license
outside
or
privilege
license
for
the
purpose
of
general
revenue.
now,
that's
been
clearly
held
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
of
course,
within
the
city,
you
can't
license
for
general
revenue
purposes
and
the
business,
the
establishment,
cannot
contest
on
the
ground
that
it's
more
than
the
cost
of
services
might
be.
but,
outside
the
corporate
limits,
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
very
carefully
limited
that
to
a
charge
commensurate
with
the
cost
of
the
services
rendered.
that's
been
going
on
since
1881
in
the
city
of
van
holt
versus
selma.
the
supreme
--
they
were
then
making
charges
outside
of
the
corporate
limits
and,
there,
the
struck
down
an
ordinance
that
made
a
charge
more
than
the
reasonable
cause
of
promoting
the
health
welfare
and
wellbeing
of
those
persons
in
the
police
jurisdiction.
later,
when
the
so-called
authorization
to
tax,
it's
been
cited
here
many
times,
was
adoptive
of
the
state
legislature
in
1927,
that's
when
it
was
adopted
in
another
case
which
i
don't
have
before
me.
it's
in
my
brief.
squarely
ruled
on
it
and
the
court
held
that
this
added
nothing
to
the
authority
of
a
municipality
to
license
within
the
police
jurisdiction.
all
this
authorized
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
it
does.
it
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
certainly,
it
involves
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
absolutely,
your
honor.
it
allows
the
ordinances
that
are
effective
within
the
corporate
limits
to
be
effective
also
outside
and
within
a
limited
area.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir?
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
we
had
that
complaint
quite
often,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
they
would
call
the
police
department
or
the
police
commissioner
or
simply
come
before
the
commission
board,
as
they
often
do,
and
ask
that
the
patrols
be
extended
on
a
more
regular
basis.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
if
they
refuse
to
go
into
--
i
don't
think
the
city
could
be
required
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
they
could
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
no,
sir,
but
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
well,
in
the
sense
that
if
you're
not
talking
about
a
person
engaged
in
business
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
that's
quite
true.
they
do
not
vote
in
the
corporate
limits,
your
honor.
they
do
not
have
that
control.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
there
is
a
county
sheriff
and
there
is
a
county
police
force,
and
it
is,
of
course,
the
duty
of
the
sheriff
to
police
in
this
area.
unfortunately,
in
alabama,
maybe
our
laws
are
not
as
good
as
they
should
be,
but
the
county
has
more
or
less
been
a
caretaking
institution.
the
deputy
sheriffs
do
get
out,
do
actually
get
called
outside,
but
they
spend
much
of
their
time
supporting
the
court's
issuing
subpoena,
that
sort
of
thing.
for
instance,
our
laws
for
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverage
limit
the
right
to
have
on
premises
sales
to
the
police
jurisdiction
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
city
police
are
equipped
and
able
to
enforce
that
area.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir,
they
do.
it's
countywide.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
countywide.
as
a
matter
of
course,
they
take
the
position,
"it's
none
of
our
business
in
the
city."
"you
take
care
of
it
because
it's
expensive."
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir,
they
certainly
do.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
sir?
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
we
have
--
the
state
highway
patrol
also
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
that's
all.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
they
have
other
jurisdiction.
they
primarily
concern
themselves
with
traffic,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
the
highway
patrol.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
no,
we
have
other
police
too.
we
have
the
criminal
investigation
division
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
some
of
the
enforcement
people
for
their
abc
board.
they
are
the
police-type
officers
of
the
state.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
other
than
the
highway
patrol,
no.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
in
practice,
it
is
not
either,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
of
course,
they
have
to
have
a
county
license
as
well
as
a
city
license.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
the
city
could
prohibit
the
sale
of
liquor,
a
liquor
license.
under
our
peculiar
law,
the
abc
board,
the
state
agency,
is
vested
primarily
with
the
control
of
all
the
alcoholic
beverages.
but,
the
law
does
grant
to
the
municipality
the
right
to
approve
or
disapprove
the
granting
of
an
on-premises
liquor
license
as
such.
a
bill
writes,
"no,
we
could
not
prohibit
it
anywhere,
except
to
plead
with
the
abc
board."
but,
the
liquor
license,
yes,
it
could
be
prohibited
by
the
municipal
corporation
in
that
area
or
it
could
be
prohibited
by
the
abc
board,
and
that's
--
people
often
go
to
the
abc
board
with
that
complaint.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
complain
to
the
county
or
they
can
complain
to
the
abc
board,
which
is
often
done,
yes.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
state
board.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
the
city
can
do
that
and
does
do
it
in
certain
cases,
and
i
would
like
to
--
in
connection
with
that,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
answer
a
question,
too,
about
the
annexation
procedures
in
alabama
because
i
think
they're
tied
together.
for
instance,
we
have
no
right
to
annex
proctor
to
the
city
unless,
in
all
cases,
unless
some
--
the
majority,
the
property
owners
themselves,
agree.
we
have
many
more
--
let's
say,
more
than
one,
several
areas
where
there's
a
highly
developed
industrial
or
business
area
community
and
down
the
main
street
on
one
side
will
be
corporate
limits,
on
the
other
side
will
be
police
jurisdiction.
of
course,
you
direct
traffic
there.
they're
all
bound
by
the
signs
and,
even
where
it's
not
adjacent
to
the
--
they
do
that
where
it's
necessary
to
do
so
to
some
extent.
for
instance,
now,
the
industries,
if
you
look
at
the
interrogatories
here,
that
looks
like
a
whole
lot
of
money.
it
looks
like
a
massive
control
when
you
just
read
what's
in
the
code,
what
might
be
placed
out
there.
but,
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
all
of
the
industries
which
gather
around
the
city
have
traditionally
elected
not
to
come
within
the
city,
for
instance,
the
bf
goodrich
company
recently
magnanimously
gave
the
city
a
half-acre
to
build
a
fire
station
on,
which
they
did
not
to
serve
bf
goodrich
but
to
serve
all
their
corporate
limits
that
have
grown
up
to
and
around
the
plant.
incidentally,
that
allowed
the
company
to
do
away
with
their
own
individual
fire
fighting
proceedings,
but
the
purpose
is
to
serve
those
residents
of
the
city
around
there.
and
so,
these
people
get
a
great
deal
of
benefit
out
of
this
police
jurisdiction.
it's
not
a
help
to
the
city.
it
doesn't
--
financial
help,
actually
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
explains
the
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
it
certainly
explains,
i
think,
though
why
there's
no
person
that
had
--
pays
a
tax,
engaged
in
the
likes
of
businesses
of
plaintiff
in
this
suit.
not
one
of
them
have
chosen
to
sue
or
complain
about
it.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir?
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i've
been
a
city
attorney
for
over
25
years.
we
have
numerous
ordinances
on
the
book
that
say
this
ordinance
shall
be
effective
in
the
corporate
limits.
that's
never
been
questioned.
i
know
of
no
case
that
says
we
must
enforce
them
outside.
i
know
of
no
case
that
rules
that
we
can't
--
the
city
can't
limit
the
operation
to
the
corporate.
i
think
if
we
were
required,
i
think
if
we
had
the
obligation,
that
point
was
brought
up
over
here,
"do
you
have
to
send
the
police?"
i
don't
think
we
could
survive
without
any
revenue,
other
than
to
be
able
to
show
any
alabama
cases
require
that
you
not
only
must
limit
it
to
the
reasonable
cause
but
you
must
show,
affirmatively
show,
that
in
adopting
your
budget
or
it
would
be
deemed
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
don't--
your
honor,
i
would
say
no.
the
wording
of
the
statute
itself
says
they
shall
have
effect
in
the
city
and
in
the
police
jurisdiction.
i've
never
heard
of
that
being
done.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
primarily,
i
think
it's
a
city.
now,
whether
that's
an
abrogation
on
the
part
of
the
county
of
the
responsibility,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think,
though,
it
is
the
city
is
the
one
that
makes
the
investigation,
has
the
police
investigation,
the
sanitary
investigation,
notifies
the
surrounding
people
and
go
through
the
whole
procedure,
your
honor,
and
i
--
whether
the
county
could
refuse,
let's
say
they
don't,
i
think
they
possibly
could
if
they
want
to
assume
that
responsibility.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
since
1977,
your
honor,
in
the
burge
case
in
alabama,
it
will
certainly
do
so.
that
was
the
first
time
that
had
been
an
actual
requirement,
although
mr.
justice
livingston
had
indicated
that
some
years
ago
in
a
case.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
think
not.
i
think
it's
probably
inappropriate
and
outside
of
issues.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
take
judicial
notes,
certainly,
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
your
honor,
i
would
say
no.
if
you
look
at
this
case,
and
i
think
as
both
the
district
judge
where
it
was
heard,
the
single-judge
and
the
three-judge
court
did,
although
they
did
it
and
documented
it
as
they
went
along,
in
the
first
place,
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
if
you
strip
it
of
the
unnecessary
allegations,
first,
there's
an
allegation
in
there
that
people
in
the
city
of
north
port,
which
is
an
incorporated
municipality
and
adjacent
to
the
city
of
tuscaloosa,
are
treated
differently
from
people
out
in
the
police
jurisdiction
who
are
not
in
any
other
city.
that,
apparently,
is
an
attempt
to
show
an
unequal
treatment.
i
don't
think
it
has
any
validity.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
say
so
because,
actually,
these
people
are
subject
to
their
own
rules,
their
own
organized
municipality
where
they're
adjacent.
so,
disregard
that
argument.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir,
i
would
think
so.
i
certainly
would
think
so.
and,
as
far
as
the
allegation
for
the
right
to
vote,
when
these
people
live
outside
of
the
political
subrogation,
when
they've
never
been
a
part
of
the
political
subrogation,
when
we're
talking
about
a
general
municipal
election,
how
could
it
be
said
that
they
have
the
right
to
vote?
this
is
not
a
special
type
election
like
tulare
or
the
other
cases
this
court
went
into.
this
is
a
general
municipal
election.
could
it
be
said
that
because
a
person
who
lives
outside
of
the
state
of
virginia,
for
instance,
but
has
an
abiding
interest
in
that
election
could
vote
there
or
could
it
be
said
that
a
person
living
in
a
city
of
corporate
--
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
tuscaloosa,
who
otherwise
is
qualified
to
vote,
could
be
disqualified
because
he
has
simply
no
interest
in
the
election?
the
interest
doctrine
is
not
applicable.
these
people
have
never
been
a
part
of
the
political
subrogation.
they
have
no
right
to
vote.
i
think
that,
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
is
obvious.
if
you
lay
that
aside,
lay
aside
the
right
--
the
allegations
that
these
people
have
a
right
to
vote,
which
seems
to
me
of
course
is
not
sought,
it's
alleged
simply
because
if
you
deny
the
right
to
vote,
if
you're
alleged
you're
denying
the
right
to
vote,
you're
alleged
a
substantial
injury.
but,
when
you
allege
it
only
to
grand
jurisdiction
and
credibility
on
another
matter,
i
would
say
lay
that
aside
to
vote,
then
you
have,
in
the
complaint,
there's
no
attempt
to
challenge
any
particular
ordinance
and
the
brief
of
the
appellant's
state
that
we
don't
find
it
necessary
to
attack
any
particular
ordinance
or
the
effect
of
it
nor
do
we
find
it
necessary
to
show
that
any
particular
ordinance
were
threatened
by
any
such
particular
order.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
now,
that
puts
an
issue
just
one
question,
as
i
understand
it,
and
that
would
be
this,
whether
or
not
a
state
statute
granting
any
vestige
of
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
to
its
municipality
is
unconstitutional
per
se.
now,
that
pure
legal
question,
i
think,
was
presented
to
the
courts
and,
although
they
documented
their
various
findings
beautifully
as
the
district
judge
did,
i
think
that
does
present
a
pure
legal
question
that
could
be
handled
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir,
they
did.
they
said
they
uncon
--
unlawfully
--
they
haven't
alleged
--
they
haven't
asked
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
had
thought,
your
honor,
that
they
allege
they'd
been
denied
the
right
to
vote.
of
course
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
well
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
it
doesn't
say
they
were
denied.
it
says
that
--
it's
trying
to
state
it
in
the
abstract,
"the
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
in
city
elections."
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
they
certainly
do
not
ask
for
the
right
to
vote.
maybe
there's
not
a
specific
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
that
aspect
of
the
ordinance
was
not
struck
down
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
it
cannot
exceed
50
%,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
no,
sir.
that's
the
court's
ruling.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
the
court's
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
the
court's
ruling
was
to
the
reasonable
cost,
but
they
did
uphold
the
state
statute
and
limit
it
to
one-half.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
you
see,
the
privilege
light
is
the
only
vehicle
afforded
to
collect
this
so-called
charge
to
pay
for
the
services.
it
couldn't
be
levied
against
any
private
individual
out
there.
the
ordinary
citizen
is
--
really,
lives
in
the
best
of
two
worlds.
he
has
some
minimum
police
protection,
some
minimum
fire
protection,
it
doesn't
cost
him
a
dime,
the
county
takes
care
of
his
schooling,
takes
care
of
his
roads,
he
votes
for
all
the
elected
officials,
it
sets
up
his
balloting
place.
actually,
it
may
not
be
an
imperfect
political
situation,
but
i
don't
see
that
it's
an
unconstitutional
situation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
in
that
particular
place,
i
believe,
your
honor,
for
heavy
industry
we
happen
to
have
and
still
have
a
flat
fee
and
they
pay,
as
my
recollection
is,
they
pay
a
license
to
$5,000
per
anum,
10,000--
it
is
based
graduated
on
the
volume.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
it's
graduated
on
volume,
but
the
maximum
is
$5,000.
they
do
several
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
gross
sales,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
that's
right.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
the
lasting
code
sets
out
a
different
category
for
many
of
the
businesses.
we
tried
to
standardize
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
if
they
happen
to
be
there.
and,
once
they
pay
that
half
license
then
they're
absolutely
entitled
to
police
and
fire
protection
and,
of
course,
the
reduction
in
the
fire
rates
probably
absorbs
that
tax
and,
as
i
say,
that's
probably
the
reason
they're
not
plaintiffs
in
this
action.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
the
district
court
would
exercise
jurisdiction
within
the
city.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
the
district
court
--
we
have
what
now
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
it
does,
yes.
we
could
elect
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
the
circuit
courts,
we
have
only
one
set
of
circuit
courts,
that's
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yeah,
that's
as
i
say,
that's
all
the
district
court
in
the
county
and,
under
the
new
judicial
article,
you
have
either
district
or
municipal
court
which
are
the
same
thing.
we
could
elect
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
then
our
court
would
simply
be
called
a
district
court.
it
has
the
same
requirements
of
judicial
training,
same
costs,
all
set
for
the
state
coo.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
well,
your
honor,
they
vote
for
the
county
commissioner,
that
is
the
governing
body
of
the
county,
the
ones
that
set
county
taxes.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
they
vote
for
their
sheriff,
they
vote
for
their
coroner,
they
vote
for
the
circuit
judges,
they
vote
for
the
tax
assessor,
the
tax
collector,
they
vote
for
the
school
board--
county
school
board.
off-hand,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
they
are.
they
vote
constables,
some
of
the
bic
committeemen,
that
sort
of
thing.
they're
all
on
the
ballot.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
your
honor,
i
guess
it's
because
when
you
get
a
law
case,
you
just
don't
want
to
get
whipped.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
your
honor,
it's
been
going
on
long
before
i
was
born.
i
don't--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
certainly,
i
may
have
been
too
--
that's
a
very
important
thing
and
i
think
if
we
gave
it
up
we
could
have
serious
encroachment
on
the
citizens
of
the
city.
i
think
we
might
go
back
to
the
old
days
when,
rather
than
having
a
corporate
limit
sign,
you
had
rural
boarding
houses
and
salons
out
there,
and
that
would
not
be
desirable.
we
recently
had
occasion
to
close
up
a
disco
in
the
corporate
limits.
fortunately,
we
were
able
to
do
so.
we'd
had
quest
of
minors
being
sold,
two
people
killed
leaving
the
place,
that
sort
of
thing.
apparently,
the
state
was
unable
to
do
it.
we
were
able
to
do
it
through
the
like,
through
--
not
through
the
liquor
license,
but
through
the
withdrawal
of
the
dancing
license
which
effectively
shut
it
down.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
it
was
filed
as
such.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
as
i
understand
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
the
district
court
--
as
i
understand
it,
you
found
that
a
class
action
was
not
--
no
lower
--
see,
to
those
--
i
don't
think
they
really
considered
that.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
that's
right.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
if
you
make
it
a
class
all
over
the
state,
of
course,
you're
dealing
with
different
ordinances
in
each
case
because
we
are
dealing
with
enabling
legislation
here.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
judge
--
i
believe
judge
mcfaton
did
that,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
think
if
the
people
in
the
police
jurisdiction
even
knew
that
this
case
were
going
on,
some
of
them
would
be
horrified.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
we
did,
your
honor,
and
i
very
frankly
don't
think
this
court
will
take
jurisdiction
on
the
moody
versus
flowers
and
korean
versus
(inaudible).
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
well
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
--
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
treat
to
standing
or
equity
jurisdiction
or
some
of
the
rather
more
important
ones.
i
didn't
argue
standing
there
because
the
district
judge
had
felt
that
the
case
of
tulare
versus
the
water
district
was
binding,
but
i
distinguished
that
in
the
brief
and
i
think
it's
distinguishable.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
judge
mcfaton,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
he
held
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
he
didn't
--
he
ruled
that
they
did
have
--
speculated
it
did
have
standing.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
treat
on
that
part
of
it,
but
they
did
not
even
treat
the
question
standing.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
yes
and,
of
course,
the
standing
goes
to
the
jurisdiction,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
see
my
time
is
just
about
up.
there
are
two
propositions
that
i
do
want
to
state
that
i
believe
ought
to
be
central
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
certainly,
they're
essential
to
my
argument.
one,
that
the
right
to
vote
is
not
at
stake
here.
what
is
at
stake
is
the
right
of
a
state,
under
its
police
powers
by
statute,
to
extend
any
vestige
of
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
and,
secondly,
that
when
relief
is
sought
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
particularly
in
the
interpretation
of
a
state
statute,
it
is
only
when
an
established
or
fundamental
constitutional
right
is
impinged
upon
by
the
state
that
strict
judicial
scrutiny,
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
or
the
choice
of
the
least
restrictive
alternative
is
required.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
do
not
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
don't
--
they
may
have
been
performing
a
state
policy,
but
they're
not
performing
a
state
function,
as
required
in
--
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
well,
it
certainly
would
so.
i
was
really
prepared
to
argue
all
of
that,
but
i
didn't
have
the
opportunity.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
no,
sir,
none
was
made.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
i
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wagner
finnell
thank
you.
