j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
still,
how
old
a
statute
is
this
alabama
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
they're
pretty
old
statutes
to
be
challenged
at
this
late
date,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
finnell,
you
mentioned
liquor
licenses.
i
take
it
the
location
of
places
that
may
engage
in
the
business
of
selling
alcohol
beverages
outside
the
city
itself
but
within
the
three-mile
area,
that's
determined
by
the
government
of
the
city.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
can
the
city
prohibit
a
tavern
from
opening
in
a
particular
loc
--
a
particular
part
of
that
whole
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
conversely,
if
both
the
city
and
the
county
grant
a
license
for
a
particular
location,
the
residents
in
the
neighborhood
have
no
place
to
complain.
well,
i
guess,
they
complain
to
the
county
would
be
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
state
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
decision
in
whether,
in
a
particular
part
of
the
three-mile
area,
there
should
be
one-way
streets
or
what
the
specific
speed
limit
should
be
and
stop
signs
and
that
kind
of
thing?
that's
all
done
by
the
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
finnell,
along
the
same
line,
i'm
bothered
a
little
bit.
this
case
is
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
factual
controversy
at
all
enforced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
we
entitled
to
disregard
it
on
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
finnell.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
finnell,
on
this
--
again,
considering
the
fact
we
have
a
motion
to
dismiss,
have
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
they
were
denied
a
right
to
vote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
had.
i
thought
they've
alleged
that
they
were
--
that
not
having
the
right
to
vote,
their
constitutional
rights
were
being
denied
by
being
required
to
obey
the
laws
that
were
enacted
by
the
people
who
could
vote.
it
may
be
they
haven't
even
alleged
a
right
to
vote.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
"infringes
on
their
constitutional
right."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
that's
--
but
they
don't
ask
for
the
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
--
in
paragraph
13,
this
certain
individual
say
they've
been
required
to
purchase
business
license
in
order
to
engage
in
business,
but
doesn't
the
record
show
that
they
purchased
them
at
half
price,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
they
pay
for
their
business
license
is
less
than
they
would
have
to
pay
if
they
were
residents
of
the
city,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
cannot
exceed
50%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
obviously,
you're
--
tuscaloosa
must
like
this
or
they
wouldn't
have
enacted
the
ordinances
that
extend
out
in
the
county.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
the
direct
costs
are
one
thing,
but
the
indirect
intangible
costs
are
something
else.
tuscaloosa
has
an
interest
in
--
both
in
protecting
its
own
citizens
from
encroachment
of
various
influences
from
out
--
from
right
beyond
its
borders.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
finnell,
that
brings
up
the
point
that,
it
seems
to
me,
may
be
of
some
importance.
this
is
a
class
action.
it's
alleged
to
be
a
class
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
has
there
been
any
determination
by
the
district
court
of
the
--
who
would
belong
in
the
class
and
whether
the
interest
of
all
the
members
of
the
class
are
the
same
or
not?
i
can
see
how
many
residents
that
the
police
jurisdiction
might
have
a
different
view
from
other
residents
within
the
district,
and
maybe
they
shouldn't
all
be
in
the
same
class.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
that
ever
been
considered
by
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
people
might
like
to
get
licenses
for
half
price
and
other
people
might
want
to
open
a
boy
houses,
you
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
other
people
might
be
--
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
interests
that
might
conflict.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
finnell,
may
i
ask,
do
you
regard
any
of
these
defendants
as
state
officers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they're
not
state
officers,
that
would
be
another
reason
why
a
three-judge
court
was
not
required,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
in
any
event,
there
was
no
service
made
on
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
raise
any
objection
along
that
line
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
strange
though
that
the
--
if
that
was
what
is
so,
the
revolutionary
war
rodrick
strains
it
in
drafting
your
periphery
relief.
you
didn't
even
ask
for
the
right
to
vote.
it
kind
of
pause
your
case
a
little
bit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
don't
seem
to
be
outraged
about
the
inability
to
vote.
that's
the
impression
that
comes
across.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
say
"we
are
denied
the
right,"
they
don't
even
say
that.
they
say
"the
denial
does
such
and
such."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it?
i'm
sorry.
