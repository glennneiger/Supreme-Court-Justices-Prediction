justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lee
we
noticed
how
prompt
your
prior
counsel
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
commercial
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
about
wages,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
really
think,
do
you
think
to
make
a
--
suppose
i
went
to
court
and
say,
here's
a
law
that
says
i
may
not
speak
in
the
following
manner
and
i
assert
that
i
desire
to
speak
in
that
manner
and
i
think
therefore
i'm
being
restrained,
and
i
don't
want
to
commit
a
crime,
i
want
you
do
adjudicate,
don't
you
think
there's
a
case
or
controversy
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i'm
talking
about
case
or
controversy
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
enough
as
i
think
it
was
implicit
in
justice
stevens'
questions,
if
it
forbids
you
from
speaking
and
you
make
the
good
faith
of
assertion
that
i
want
to
speak
this
way
and
i
can't
unless
i
--
do
i
have
to
violate
the
statute
in
order
to
make
a
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the
defendant
have
to
say,
all
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
have
to
say,
well
i
never
attempted
to
apply
it
to
him,
they
only
have
to
say
to
avoid
the
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
then
–
but
then
you
say
that
you're
hanging
most
of
your
case
around
case
or
controversy,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
might
be
hanging
maybe
your
case
around
some
of
the
other
provisions,
but
on
this
provision
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
this
provision,
was
there
an
attack
on
the
--
in
the
complaint
on
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
this
particular
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
wanted
to
speak
in
this
way,
is
the
statute
preventive?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there's
a
case
or
controversy
about
this
particular
issue,
it
doesn't
mean
that
there's
about
any
other
one
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
we
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
you've
got
a
case
or
controversy
with
respect
to
that
issue
in
terms
of
your
own
activity,
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
overbreadths,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
if
it
really
been
applied
to
you
and
you
want
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
or
if
hasn't
been
applied
to
you
if
you
nevertheless
have
a
case
or
controversy
about
it
in
terms
of
your
own
interest
you
don't
need
to
talk
about
anybody
else's,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
talking
just
about
the
speech
section.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
you
wouldn't
suggest
overbreadth
analysis
applies
to
the
non-speech
sections,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
basis,
you
convert
every
private
property
owner
in
the
state
action
as
soon
as
he
stands
at
the
–
at
his
gate
with
a
gun
and
keeps
you
off
the
property
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
he
calls
the
sheriff
and
has
you
put
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that's
different.
you've
gotten
into
a
different
issue
than
the
property
that
you
are
saying
right
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
suggesting
that
because
there
might
be
a
question
about
the
prohibition
against
talking
to
merchants
that
the
property
provisions
are
bad
or
that
the
election
provisions
are
bad,
or
that
the
compulsory
arbitration
provisions
are
bad?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
every
strike
that's
restrained
violates
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
every
ex
parte
injunction
against
a
strike
violates
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
if
the
state,
if
there
is
a
state
statutory
provision
regulating
labor
management
relations
and
one
of
the
provisions
is
by
the
way
we
don't
believe
too
much
in
collective
bargaining
and
the
employer
need
not
recognize
any
collective
bargaining
representative
although
unions
are
certainly
legal
and
they
can
go
about
their
business
all
they
want
to,
of
trying
to
force
the
employer
into
recognizing,
but
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
the
employers
are
under
no
obligation
to
recognize
any
collective
bargaining
representative,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
my
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
well
they
--
certainly
the
state
is
nicer
to
you
in
this
case
than
in
the
one
i
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
that's
unconstitutional
by
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
claim
any
constitutional
right
to
have
a
collective
bargaining
representative
that
the
employer
will
recognize?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
i
take
you
just
a
while
ago
said
you
didn't
have
any
such
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
in
the
stipulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
[voice
overlap]
proceed
against
an
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
mean
it,
you
have
an
answer
there,
why
did
they
need
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do,
but
you
haven't
told
us
why.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
if
the,
so
what
if
the
court
had
found
only
one,
only
the
compulsory
arbitration
provisions
of
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
are
they
not
severable
or
severable?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
get
that,
out
of
the
section
1?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
assume
one
section
declared
unconstitutional,
then
would
the
entire
statute
fall?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said
compulsory
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
would,
but
how
about
compulsory
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
have
to
go
to
the
section
one
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
your
position
that
all
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
sections
are
now
--
should
have
fallen
with
these
five
sections,
all
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
sections?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
the
unions,
against
employers,
against
everybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
more
elections.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
more
anything
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
labor
relations
act
started
out,
it
was
just
unfair
labor
practices
against
employers.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
do
you
mean
if
you
struck
down
the
unfair
labor
practices
against
unions,
why
would
you
strike
down
the
ones
against
employers?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
doing
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you're
talking
about
may
be
a
(inaudible)
abstention?
justice
byron
r.
white
saving
the
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
you
are
right
about
case
or
controversy,
why,
you
probably
couldn't
get
in
a
state
courts
either.
so,
i
suppose
before
we
get
to
abstention
we
have
to
rule
against
you
on
the
case
or
controversy?
