mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
three-judge
district
court,
holding
unconstitutional
in
its
entirety,
arizona’s
agricultural
employment
relations
act.
the
invalidated
statute
is
patterned
after
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
is
it
guarantees
employee
organizational
rights,
provides
for
collective
bargaining,
secret
ballot,
election
process.
it
prohibits
20
separate
unfair
labor
practices,
establishes
an
agriculture
labor
relations
board,
gives
that
board
authority
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations
and
generally
to
enforce
and
implement
the
policies
of
that
act.
at
the
time
that
this
case
went
to
trial,
the
parties
stipulated
to
20
cases
in
which
the
act
had
been
applied
in
some
way.
eight
of
those
involved
secondary
boycotts.
six
were
election
proceeding
and
six
were
proceeding
against
employers
because
of
unfair
labor
practices,
employer
unfair
labor
practices
as
defined
by
the
act.
the
focus
at
the
trial
was
not
on
these
instances
of
enforcement
for
reasons
that
i'll
develop
in
just
about
two
minutes.
rather
the
great
bulk
of
the
evidence
at
the
trial
concentrated
on
expert
opinion
concerning
how
the
act
would
probably
be
interpreted
and
how
it
would
probably
operate.
the
principle
issue
at
the
trial
was
how
the
election
provisions
would
be
applied
and
how
long
it
will
take
to
hold
an
election
under
the
act
in
the
view
of
the
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
and
how
the
act
would
be
interpreted,
given
those
situations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
precisely
mr.
chief
justice
it
was
built
on
two
hypothesize,
one
was
factual
and
one
was
legal,
neither
of
which
we
contend
was
within
the
preview
of
district
court.
armed
with
that
kind
of
a
record,
the
court
specifically
found
constitutionally
defective,
five
specific
provisions
of
the
act,
parts
of
four
sections
out
of
some
16
of
the
act
consists
of,
including
one
out
of
20
unfair
labor
practices
and
from
this
determination
that
five
provisions
were
unconstitutional,
the
district
court
invalidated,
struck
down
the
entire
statute.
the
points
of
disagreement
between
the
parties
are
in
this
case
are
far
more
numerous
than
this
court
is
accustomed
to
dealing
with.
indeed,
there
isn't
even
an
agreement
between
the
parties
as
to
what
the
number
of
questions
presented
before
this
court
is,
but
careful
analysis
of
those
briefs
reveals
that
there
are
at
least
six
propositions
advanced
by
the
appellants
concerning
which
the
appellees
have
either
not
joined
issue
at
all
or
the
joinder
if
attempted
hasn't
really
meshed,
so
that
the
point
is
effectively
undisputed
and
fortunately
those
six
propositions
undisputed
and
undisputable
are
dispositive
of
the
case
before
this
court,
as
a
consequence
i
believe
that
the
most
helpful
way
that
i
can
use
my
scarce
oral
argument
time
of
this
afternoon
is
–
yes?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
know
that
mr.
justice
white
and
i
realize
no
constitutional
obligation,
take
all
my
time,
i
appreciate
it.
but
when
you
are
dealing
somewhere
between
seven
and
ten
questions
presented
and
each
of
the
ten
raises
many
sub
issues,
there
is
some
problem
of
allocation,
no
matter
how
one
attempts
to
be
prompt,
which
i
assure
you
i
will
do.
so
i'd
like
concentrate
on
these
six
propositions.
the
first
two
concern
whether
this
dispute
really
amounts
to
a
case
or
controversy
at
all.
the
appellees
lay
great
stress
on
the
enforcement
stipulation.
there
are
20
instances
in
which
the
act
has
been
enforced,
but
the
fact
that
is
not
disputed
is
that
of
the
five
provisions
held
unconstitutional
by
the
district
court,
namely
the
sections
dealing
with
elections,
untruthful
publicity,
binding
arbitration,
free
access
to
employer
facilities,
and
the
provisions
making
violations
of
misdemeanor,
not
one,
not
a
single
one
has
ever
been
applied
to
any
of
these
plaintiffs.
there
is,
indeed
the
only
section
that's
ever
been
applied
to
anyone
of
those
five
is
the
election
provision
and
that's
not
to
these
plaintiffs.
now
there
is
an
attempt
by
the
appellees
as
to
one
of
these
provisions,
sub
section
8
of
the
unfair
labor
practices,
the
one
that
prohibits
untruthful
publicity
to
join
issue
but
they
don't
really
do
so.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
one
case
only,
case
number
two,
the
safeway
case,
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
of
a
violation
of
sub
section
8,
but
the
superior
court,
the
trial
court
made
a
preliminary
determination,
a
threshold
determination
that
the
union's
conduct
in
that
case
was
a
sufficient
compliance
with
sub
section
8
and
as
a
consequence
it
has
never
been
applied
and
we
are
left
with
this
fact
that
of
all
of
those
20
instances
not
one
has
ever
been
applied
to
these
plaintiffs.
the
second
point
of
no
real
dispute
is
this
and
it
concerns
the
law
dealing
with
this
kind
of
case.
i
know
of
no
case
and
in
the
six
years
of
this
litigation
our
opponents
have
not
been
able
to
suggest
any
in
which
this
court
has
approved
the
consideration
in
its
entirety
of
a
comprehensive
regulatory
statute
whose
provisions
raise
a
variety
of
separate
constitutional
questions
in
advance
of
and
in
the
absence
of
the
application
to
those
provisions
to
particular
individual.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
let
me
answer
it
in
two
parts
mr.
justice
stevens.
that
is
a
--
that
is
an
issue
of
course
that
is
applicable
only
to
the
election
procedure
and
not
the
entire
act.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
even
so
i
would
feel
much
more
comfortable
if
at
least
they
had
tried
to
hold
an
election
and
there
had
been
some
demonstration
some
facts
on
the
record
that
in
fact
it
takes
too
long
to
hold
an
election.
here
there
is
simply
an
assumption
that
it
takes
too
long,
an
assumption
that
is
entirely
unfounded.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
we
certainly
do,
but
my
point
i
think
is
nevertheless
valid,
that
at
the
very
least
with
regard
to
case
or
controversy
as
it
applies
to
elections,
that
you
have
to
at
least
have
tried
and
at
least
to
have
shown
that
in
fact
there
is
some
--
on
the
merits
the
election
issue
depends
on
delay.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
not
and
the
only
--
in
the
final
analysis
we
point
out
in
brief
the
only
thing
that
they
are
saying
is
that
whereas
before
arizona
had
no
election,
now
it
has
an
election
process,
but
what
they
are
really
complaining
about
is
it
arizona
did
not
go
far
enough
and
provide
enough
protection
for
associational
interests
as
perceived
by
the
appellees
and
there
is
this
case
from
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
that
says
very
clearly,
that
there
is
no
obligation
on
any
state
to
do
that.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
but
you
have
problems
even
there,
because
the
district
court
and
the
appellees
have
both
made
the
statement,
this
is
their
language
that
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
dealing
with
elections
and
provisions
of
the
aera
dealing
with
elections
are
virtually
identical.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
don't
think
it
ever
says
that
mr.
justice
stevens.
that's
been
a
point
of
dispute
between
us
and
the
appellees
all
throughout
this
entire
procedure.
i
find
nothing
in
this
statute
that
says
it
cannot
have
voluntary
recognition.
there
is
dispute
about
the
bargaining
order
provision
and
there
is
dispute
about
the
volunteering,
but
that's
what
brings
us
back.
we
ought
not
to
be
here
talking
about
issues
of
arizona
law
and
that's
really
what
is
involved
there,
these
issues
of
arizona
law.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
[inaudible]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
this
case
is
here
far
too
soon.
we
pointed
to
the
watson
and
mcadory
cases
in
our
brief.
those
cases
are
squarely
on
point.
those
involved
comprehensive
statutes.
coming
back
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
your
analogy
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that's
the
analogies,
both
--
this
is
a
fair
description
of
both
of
those
statutes.
each
of
them
consists
of
organizational
guarantees,
collective
bargaining
guarantees,
prohibition
of
unfair
labor
practices,
the
establishment
of
an
administrative
agency
with
power
to
implement
the
act.
now
that's
both
statutes
in
a
word.
it
is
unthinkable
that
this
court
would
have
permitted
any
court,
federal
or
state
to
start
at
the
beginning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
wade
through
all
of
its
probations,
declare
five
parts
unconstitutional
when
none
of
them
had
been
enforced
as
to
any
of
the
plaintiffs
and
then
based
on
that
kind
of
determination,
hold
the
whole
statute
unconstitutional.
now
there
are
statements
coming
out
of
this
court
condemning
that
kind
of
practice,
reaching
all
the
way
back
from
justice
holmes
day
to
the
opinion
says
february
20th,
but
i
was
cautioned
by
the
chief
justice
that
it
really
should
say
february
21st.
mr.
justice
powell's
opinion
for
the
court
this
morning
in
friedman
versus
rogers,
it
was
the
same
problem.
these
people
who
were
the
commercial
optometrists
said
we
fear
that
we
can't
get
a
fair
hearing
before
a
body
that
is
composed
substantially
of
the
non-commercial
optometrists
and
justice
powell
acknowledged
that
they
were
entitled
under
the
gibson
and
wall
cases
to
a
fair
hearing,
but
then
the
opinion
goes
on
to
say
in
both
gibson
and
wall
however
disciplinary
proceedings
had
been
instituted
against
the
plaintiff's
and
the
courts
were
able
to
examine
in
a
particular
context
the
possibility
that
the
members
of
the
regulatory
board
might
have
personal
interest
that
precluded
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing
of
the
charges.
in
contrast,
rogers
challenged
to
the
fairness
of
the
board,
does
not
arise
from
any
disciplinary
proceeding
against
him.
in
a
word,
election
cases
--
the
constitutionality
of
the
election
probations
ought
to
be
decided
in
election
case.
at
least
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
would
then
know
if
in
fact
there
are
problems
of
delay.
access
to
employer
facilities
ought
to
be
decided
in
an
access
case
and
unfair
and
untruthful
publicity
ought
to
be
decided
in
a
case
that
at
least
involves
union
publicity.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
i
think
that
at
that
point
at
least
you
would
have
established
factually
that
there
was
a
delay
problem
if
there
is
a
delay
problem
and
i
think
at
that
point
you
can
come
into
federal
court.
i
will
grant
you
that
the
election
cases,
the
election
cases
do
present
a
unique
situation,
but
here
where
you've
never
even
tried
these,
where
there
is
nothing
anywhere
that
shows
in
fact
that
there
is
delay
and
where
we
vigorously
dispute
that
there
is
a
delay
problem
and
i'll
develop
that
in
just
about
two
minutes.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case
that
the
court
ought
to
be
deciding
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
it
would
if
in
fact
you
could
show
that
the
factual
premise
on
which
your
attack
is
being
based
was
in
fact
correct.
i
think
the
case
or
controversy
would
require
at
least
that.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
this
is
another
of
those
instances
in
which
there
is
a
very
close
relationship
between
the
merits
and
case
or
controversy,
but
i
do
think
that
you
need
that,
do
more
than
just
make
the
formal
application.
i
think
you'd
need
to
show
that
the
factual
predicate
of
the
constitutional
issue
that
you
are
raising
is
in
fact
there
otherwise
you
are
bringing
the
federal
machinery
into
play
when
it
may
not
make
a
difference.
that
of
course
is
also
closely
relates
to
the
abstention
question.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
a
closely
related
issue
which
is
the
severability
question
and
here
the
dispositive
reality
is
that
that
have
not
been
disputed
are
two.
the
first
is
that
the
test
for
severability
as
it
has
been
announced
in
this
court
is
the
champlin
test
that
is
cited
in
page
77
of
our
brief
unless
it
is
evident
that
the
legislature
would
not
have
enacted
those
provisions
wherein
its
power
independently
that
which
is
not,
the
invalid
part
maybe
dropped
if
what
is
left
is
fully
operative
as
a
law.
as
i
read
the
modern
cases
dealing
with
severability,
including
most
importantly
tilton
and
jackson
that
is
the
leading
statement
of
the
law
of
severability
coming
from
this
court
at
the
present
time.
that
case
is
not
acknowledged.
it's
not
even
cited
by
our
opponents
and
i
submit
that
the
reason
is
a
recognition
that,
that
test
cannot
be
satisfied
in
this
case.
applying
that
test
it
is
nothing
short
of
absurd
to
say
that
arizona's
judgments
for
example
that
there
should
be
collective
bargaining
for
arizona,
for
agricultural
labor
or
that
the
union
should
not
be
permitted
to
picket
the
homes
of
agricultural
workers
or
find
one
of
its
members
because
it
gives
testimony
before
the
board
or
that
an
employer
should
not
be
permitted
to
dominate
a
union
or
contribute
financial
support
or
discriminate
against
an
employee
because
of
union
activities
and
many
others
in
any
way
depend
on
whether
there's
been
an
election
or
whether
compulsory
arbitration
is
constitutional
or
whether
there
is
access
to
employer
facilities.
regardless
of
how
you
come
out
on
those
five
issues,
the
arizona
legislature
has
concluded
that
arizona
needs
an
agricultural
labor
relations
board
and
that
that
board
needs
the
authority
to
prohibit
19
out
of
20
un-invalidated,
unfair
labor
practices.
the
magnitude
of
the
district
court's
error
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
arizona
is
now
prevented
from
controlling
unfair
labor
practices
that
non
even
appellees
contended
were
unconstitutional
including
irony
of
all
ironies,
employer
unfair
labor
practices.
look
at
the
enforcement
stipulation.
just
about
a
third
of
those
cases
were
cases
in
which
the
employer
had
discriminated
against
his
employees
because
of
their
union
activities.
my
client,
the
state
of
arizona
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
preventing
that
kind
of
employer
conduct
and
in
those
instances
where
there
has
been
employer
retaliation
in
bringing
into
play
on
the
employee
side
of
the
conflict
the
way
to
the
state
to
prevent
that
kind
of
employer
conduct
and
the
same
in
the
event
that
the
union
has
taken
improper
action
against
its
own
members.
we
come
now
to
the
most
important
subject
of
question
and
that
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
1389
dealing
with
elections.
the
district
court
made
it
very
clear
that
this
was
its
pivotal
holding,
the
most
important
subject
of
holding
and
this
is
one
of
the
provisions
that
was
invalidated
on
the
basis
of
the
“evidence.”
but
the
evidence
that
the
court
found
relevant
was
not
evidence
developed
on
in
any
actual
case
or
controversy.
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
it
was
based
on
a
twin
hypothesis
how
the
act
would
work
and
how
it
would
be
interpreted
and
it
was
that
hypothetical,
not
any
of
the
such
election
cases
that
have
actually
been
held,
it
was
that
hypothetical
that
was
held
unconstitutional.
now
even
aside
from
the
obvious
case
or
controversy
problems,
with
that
kind
of
approach
what
substantively
was
wrong
with
this
election
procedure
and
the
thing
that
was
wrong
with
it
is
that
in
some
instances
it
might
be
impossible,
the
district
court
hypothesized,
to
hold
an
election
during
the
employment
peak.
now
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
problem
of
how
you
solve
elections
during
an
employment
peak
is
an
important
one.
it
is
also
one
whose
optimum
solution
is
not
readily
apparent.
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
adopted
one
solution
to
that
problem.
the
california
agriculture
labor
act
has
adopted
another.
nlrb
solution
is
to
hold
the
election
during
the
next
employment
peak
and
the
california
procedure
or
the
california
solution
is
to
hold
the
election
rather
quickly
to
decide
only
the
question
of
representation
and
then
once
that's
decided
to
defer
all
other
issues
until
after
the
election.
there
is
absolutely
no
authority
except
the
opinion
which
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
that
has
ever
held
that
the
selection
of
either
these
solutions
raises
significant
constitutional
problems,
none.
in
that
respect
alone
the
district
court's
decision
is
surprising
enough,
but
the
absolutely
incredible
feature
of
the
district
court's
holding
is
that
it
has
invalided
an
election
scheme
that
permits
and
indeed
anticipates
the
adoption
of
either
alternative
according
to
the
needs
of
the
particular
case.
that
has
never
been
--
it
has
never
been
disputed
and
even
if
you
assume
that
one
of
those
or
the
other
could
be
held
unconstitutional,
even
as
a
matter
of
abstract
theory,
the
position
cannot
be
taken
that
a
procedure
which
permits
the
adoption
of
either
according
to
the
needs
of
the
particular
case
is
unconstitutional.
there
is
a
statement
in
the
motion
to
affirm
to
this
effect
that
the
act
must
be
nullified
in
all
its
provisions
and
returned
to
the
legislature
to
strike
a
new
balance.
i
find
that
statement
absolutely
intriguing.
what
new
balance
is
to
be
struck?
as
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion
and
the
appellee's
briefs,
the
only
constitutionally
acceptable
alternative
is
the
california
act
and
yet
arizona
law,
it
says
not
been
disputed
by
our
opponents
permits
the
adoption
of
the
californian
procedure.
now,
pursuant
to
justice
white's
urging,
let
me
simply
take
about
30
seconds,
mr.
chief
justice
and
just
observe
this.
first,
with
regard
to
the
truthful
publicity
i
think
the
friedman
versus
rogers
is
a
valuable
additional
case
that
bears
on
the
question
of
the
extent
of
arizona's
authority
to
prohibit
untruthful
speech
and
i'm
referring
particularly
to
the
comments
on
page
8
of
that
opinion.
with
regard
to
compulsory
arbitration
under
the
seventh
amendment
and
substantive
due
process
our
opponents
are
virtually
thrown
in
the
towel.
they
have
an
additional
argument,
i'll
deal
with
that
in
response,
if
it
needs
to
be
dealt
with,
i'm
not
sure
what
position
they
take.
and
finally,
with
regard
to
access
to
employer
facilities,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
depends
on
three
assumptions.
they
have
not
disputed
the
fact
that
it
depends
on
three
assumptions
and
they've
really
only
attacked
one
of
the
three,
and
for
these
and
many
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
federal
district
court
should
never
been
involved
been
in
this
case
in
the
first
place.
it
committed
numerous
errors
and
most
egregious
of
which
was
its
deciding
a
dispute
that
it's
not
a
case
or
controversy
and
we
submit
those
judgments.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
there
have.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
swing
problem?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yeah,
very
simply
this
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
swing
case
as
you
know
arose
in
your
state
and
it
was
a
beauty
parlor,
they
lost
the
election
and
then
they
continue
to
picket
around
the
swing
beauty
parlor.
that
we
submit
as
an
entirely
different
case
because
the
pressure
there
was
primary.
it
was
around
the
target
of
the
organizational
activity
and
it's
a
very
narrow
opinion
and
justice
frankfurter
makes
it
very
clear
that
that's
all
it
applies
to
is
the
facts
of
that
case.
by
contrast
what
we
have
here
insofar
as
the
second
part
of
sub
eight
is
concerned,
is
secondary
pressure
that
is
brought
to
bear
and
if
the
national
labor
relations
act
shows
us
anything,
it
is
the
distinction
in
this
respect
between
secondary
pressures
and
primary
pressures.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
but
i
think,
the
clear
message
coming
from
(inaudible),
for
example,
which
has
no
suggestion
that
that
case
was
constitutionally
based,
is
that
insofar
as
secondary
pressures
if
they
are
--
unless
they
go
too
far,
that
they
will
be
upheld.
once
again
this
is
a
fallback
position
on
the
case
or
controversy
we
need
to
know
what
the
facts
are.
in
the
swing,
we
had
the
actual
facts
of
that
case,
but
there's
a
distinction
i
submit
of
constitutional
dimension
between
primary
pressure
such
as
were
involved
in
the
swing
on
the
one
hand
and
secondary
pressures
such
as
they're
clearly
involved
in
that
aspect
of
this
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
a
proper
case
for
application
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
for
these
three
reasons.
the
leading
overbreadth
case
is
broadrick.
broadrick
says
that
application
of
the
overbreadth
standard
depends
on
the
mixed
speech
and
conduct.
here
we
don't
know
what
that
mixed
speech
and
conduct
is
and
we
won't
know
until
we
actually
have
a
case
that
demonstrates
it
in
the
particular
instance.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
you
do
have
a
facial
attack,
but
you
at
least
in
broadrick,
broadrick
and
his
companions
at
least
had
engaged
in
the
permissible
scope
of
the
activity
that
is,
or
excuse
me,
the
prohibitable
part
of
the
activity
that
is
campaigning
for
their
bosses.
here
we
have
nothing.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
sure.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
and
for
that
matter,
for
that
matter
it's
like
friedman
versus
rogers
which
came
out
this
morning
and
indeed
in
the
broadrick
case
itself
mr.
justice
white
cited
from
the
wurzbach,
the
wurzbach
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me
--
--
for
the
court.
in
his
opinion
for
the
court,
mr.
justice
white
cited
united
states
versus
wurzbach
which
says
that
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
when
we
have
a
case
that
actually
affects
someone.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
thought
about
that
this
morning
as
i
read
friedman
versus
rogers.
i
don't
think
that
my
position
depends
on
it
being
commercial
speech
but
i
think
that
they're
at
least
first,
double
first
cousins.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it's
about
wages,
it's
about
economic
issues
and
it's
about,
it's
about
who
pays
whom,
how
much
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
at
that
point
you
have
to
apply
the
court's
opinion
in
broadrick
versus
oklahoma
and
that
depends
on
several
things.
one
is
you
will
note
that
in
broadrick,
broadrick
had
in
fact
engaged
in
the
prohibitable
component
and
therefore
you
could
see
the
mix
of
speech
and
conduct
insofar
as
at
least
the
prohibitable
part
was
concerned.
secondly,
there's
a
caution
in
the
broadrick
opinion
that
if
the
statute
needs
to
be
interpreted
by
the
state
court,
then
the
overbreadth
doctrine
should
be
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
understand.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
be
easier
to
answer
that
question
i
submit
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
you
go
back
and
you
pickup
coates
versus
cincinnati
and
broadrick
versus
oklahoma
and
that
is
an
issue
that
has
bedeviled
this
court.
it
has
been
to
difficult
to
answer
that
particular
question
as
i
don't
need
to
tell
you
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
pretty
good
argument,
but
it
is
not
most
of
the
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh
yes,
with
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
they
--
well,
that
i
don't
know
that
they
actually
allege
[voice
overlap]
untruthful
publicity
but
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
alleged
it,
they
would
have
alleged
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me,
untruthful
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
second
part
and
it
does.
my
only
response
is
that
that
it
is
a
difficult
issue
whether
overbreadth
applies
to
any
kind
of
case.
but
as
i
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course,
of
course
and
that's
the
big
problem
is
that
they've
attempted
to
apply
it
all
across
the
entire
breadth
of
the
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
i
do
if
chief
justice
would
like
to
go
ahead
at
this
time.
i
would
simple
like
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
i
appreciate
that
courtesy
mr.
chief
justice.
may
i
simple
point
out
that
most
of
my
friend
mr.
cohen's
argument
has
been
directed
to
portions
of
the
statute
as
to
which
there
is
no
record
or
not
presented
in
the
either
the
questions
presented
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
nor
in
the
motion
to
affirm.
there
are
no
findings
of
fact.
there
have
been
no
even
determination
by
the
district
court
and
as
a
consequence
those
issues
come
before
this
court
at
this
time
for
the
first
time.
and
that
aside
from
everything
else
whether
that
amounts
to
case
or
controversy
or
simple
good
judicial
procedure
does
not
make
sense.
most
of
mr.
cohen's
argument
has
been
directed
toward
the
tro
procedure,
b7,
b10,
and
b12.
let
me
turn
however,
very
briefly
to
those
and
give
my
response
though
i
say
that
a
fortiori
this
is
not
being
a
case
or
controversy
as
to
those
issues
that
the
district
court
did
decide,
it's
certainly
is
not
a
case
or
controversy
as
to
those
issues
that
the
district
court
did
not
decide
and
that
were
not
included
as
part
of
the
questions
presented
in
the
jurisdictional
papers.
first,
with
the
regard
to
tros.
this
has
been
the
principal
procedure
objection
that
has
been
raised
all
along,
but
let
me
isolate
the
issue
very
precisely.
i
agree
with
mr.
cohen
that
rule
65
of
the
arizona
rules
of
civil
procedure
is
made
a
part
of
everyone
of
those
tro
proceedings.
rule
65
of
the
arizona
rules
of
civil
procedure
is
identical
to
the
federal
rule.
there
are
only
two
differences,
one
has
a
comma
where
the
other
one
doesn't,
and
one
says
‘and'
where
the
other
one
says
‘or.'
carroll
did
not
say,
carroll
did
not
say
that
under
no
circumstances,
can
there
be
temporary
restraining
orders
without
notice.
the
rule
in
carroll
is
identical
to
the
federal
rule
65.
so
that
what
my
opponents
are
in
effect
asking
this
court
at
this
time
is
to
hold
rule
65
unconstitutional,
including
the
federal
rule
and
they
are
also
asking
that
carroll
be
overruled.
now,
with
regard
to
the
b7
arguments,
that
case,
as
this
court
will
recognize,
simply
reverses
for
arizona
purposes
(inaudible)
case
that
came
down
in
1964
and
makes
it
alright
to
or
makes
it
a
secondary
boycott
in
effect
to
induce,
encourage
and
so
forth
management
employees.
now
there
was
--
i
look
at
(inaudible)
recently
this
morning.
there
is
no
hint
of
a
constitutional
basis
for
(inaudible)
holding.
mr.
cohen
is
very
creative
and
i'll
grant
you
that
if
you
take
his
interpretation
of
that
statute
that
when
you
say
those
oranges
have
been
treated
with
dangerous
pesticides,
don't
buy
them,
but
that
raises
serious.
first
amendment
questions,
i
couldn't
agree
more.
but
i
vigorously
disagree
that
that's
what
that
statute
means
and
i
think
that
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
when
it
has
never
been
considered
by
the
lower
court
when
there
is
no
record
on
it
and
when
there
is
nothing
anywhere
in
that
enforcement
stipulation,
that
has
even
a
hint
of
that
kind
of
an
enforcement
of
b7
that
this
is
the
time
to
be
applying
it.
now
with
regard
to
b12
and
this
prohibition
of
organizational
activities
after
an
election
has
been
filed.
the
real
fear
there
--
b12
is
simply
a
counterpart
of
the
federal
rule
that
says
where
you
had
an
election
or
where
a
petition
has
been
filed
within
12
months,
then
further
picketing
and
organizational
activity
is
prohibited.
the
fear
is
that
that
will
be
used
for
an
improper
purpose
and
i
can
see
fully
the
possibility
of
its
being
used
for
an
improper
purpose,
just
the
same
as
in
friedman
versus
rogers
there
was
a
possibility
of
an
improper
hearing
being
held.
but
if,
it
were
used
for
that
purpose
then
it
is
very
clear
that
under
a
combination
of
1383
and
1385
a1,
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
there
would
be
a
defense
to
it
for
that
reason
and
that
reason
alone.
as
a
consequence
this
conjures
of
defects
all
of
which
combine
to
exercise
and
effect
on
associational
interest
that
is
management
rights,
boycott,
talking
to
manager
of
the
store,
talking
about
pesticides
are
illusory
in
this
case.
they
depend
again
on
hypothesis,
on
speculation
and
they
are
hypotheses
and
speculation
with
which
we
vigorously
disagree.
now
in
that
regard,
look
at
tree
fruits.
there
is
no
question
that
in
tree
fruits
just
as
the
amicus
says
this
court
went
to
great
lengths
to
construe
that
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
–
as
to
save
it.
and
it
did
so,
in
fact,
in
reading
out
that
language
except
picketing
that
is
contained
in
the
8b42b
proviso.
it
did
so
because
of
its
first
amendment
concerns.
now,
a
decent
respect
we
submit
for
a
comity
within
a
federal
system
and
for
the
respect
of
one
judicial
system
for
another
judicial
system
indicates
that
the
same
approach
ought
to
be
or
the
same
difference
ought
to
be
accorded
to
the
arizona
courts.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
by
permitting
in
the
b8
context
mr.
justice
white,
an
opportunity
well
in
all
other
contexts
for
the
arizona
courts
to
say
what
their
statute
means.
in
every
instance,
this
b7
and
the
b8
depends
on
how
you
read
the
statute.
similarly
the
election
provision
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
exactly
what
i'm
talking.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
exactly
what
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
not.
finally
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
if
that
is
a
defect,
mr.
stevens,
it
is
a
defect
in
rule
65
of
the
federal
rules
because
that
is
exactly
what
rule
65
permits.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
but
carroll
said
that
you
have
to
get,
you
have
to
give
actual
notice
except
when
there
is
some
kind
of
compelling
reasons
that
you
can't.
that
is
the
rule
65
rule,
so
that
carroll
in
effect
in
a
first
amendment
case
affirmed
the
rule
65
approach
to
life.
there
is
nothing
in
this
appendix,
nothing
or
anywhere
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
in
fact
there
was
any
impropriety,
any
failure
to
observe
the
rule
65
or
any
failure
to
attempt,
there
is
simply
nothing
on
it
as
to
what
the
facts
in
those
cases
were.
this
is
just
not
the
case
to
be
deciding
the
constitutionality
of
rule
65,
which
is
necessarily
what
you
have
to
decide.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
think
that
in
a
case
in
which
i
go
into
court,
i
get
a
tro
against
mr.
cohen,
and
then
he
immediately
goes
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
on
a
special
writ,
which
that
statute
provides
and
attempts
to
dissolve
it
because
i've
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
mootness
would
not
be
a
problem
because
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
and
i
vigorously
urge
you
not
to
do
that,
mr.
justice
white
and
on
that
happy
note,
i
will
conclude
my
argument.
