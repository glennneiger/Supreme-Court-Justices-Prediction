justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lee,
can
i
just
ask
you
about
your
problem
here?
supposing
the
election
procedure
is
so
cumbersome
and
the
timing
is
so
bad
that
they
can
never
have
an
election,
could
they
ever
challenge
it?
because
the
whole
hypothesis
on
which
their
argument
is
built
is
that
they
can
never
get
an
election
in
any
event
and
i
think
your
argument
is
as
well
that's
just
too
bad,
we
got
an
unconstitutional
statute
here
that
can
never
be
challenged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right
but
rather
important
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
whether
they
are
right
or
not,
but
for
purposes
of
standing
in
case
or
controversy,
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
there
is
merit
to
their
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
a
difference
that
the
election
procedure
makes
it
unlawful
to
proceed
without
an
election,
in
other
words
to
have
a
bargaining
representative
voluntarily
recognized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
whether
any,
any
attempt
by
a
bargaining
representative
who
had
not
been
selected
by
means
of
an
election
was
nullified
because
he
wasn't
elected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
so
that
it's
hypothetical
in
that
sense
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
still
puzzled,
i
have
been
troubled
in
the
past
about
procedure
for
reviewing
elections
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
you
got
to
win
the
election
and
then
have
a
challenge.
supposing
they
are
holding
election,
they
loose,
what
do
they
do,
how
do
they
get
it
reviewed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
say
for
standing
purpose
if
they
had
requested
an
election
and
some
how
or
other
they
didn't
succeed
with
it,
that
would
solve
the
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
still
saw
a
little
bit
like
you
say,
you
got
to
win
on
the
merits
to
have
a
case
or
controversy
or
maybe
you
don't
mean
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lee,
i
have
two
questions
that
i'd
like
to
ask
you?
does
the
record
and
i
have
not
read
this,
the
enforcement
stipulation,
but
does
that
or
anything
else
in
the
record
tell
us
whether
there
have
ever
been
any
successful
elections
in
which
unions
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
have
been
some?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
has
been
evoked
and
it's
not
possible
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
second
question
i
had,
you've
commented
about
the
truthful
publicity
aspect
of
the
statute.
do
you
have
any
particular
response
to
the
brief
of
the
amicus,
the
american
federation
of
labor
and
cio
about
the
part
of
the
statute
that
prohibits
a
comment
when
there's
a
trade
name
or
something
like
that
that
has
--
part
of
the
people
are
involved
with
the
union
and
others
are
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
again
it's
strictly
information
of
picketing
that
they're
concerned
about,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
this
aspect
to
the
case,
going
back
to
your
whole
standing
problem,
you
do
have
a
first
amendment
issue
and
the
argument
is
that
the
statute
in
effect
is
overbroad
here,
and
so
wouldn't
under
classical
overbreadth
standing
doctrine
wouldn't
the
standing
be
okay
in
this
case
as
to
that
particular
portion
of
the
statute
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
typically
in
an
overbreadth
case
you
have
a
facial
attack.
you
never
know
what
the
conduct,
the
overbroad
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
part
of
the
statute
is
limited
on
truthful,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
prohibits
is
even
truthful
statements
about
this
trade
name
that
has
people
involved--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i'm
just
talking
about
untruthful
dispute
here,
it's
important
too
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen
what
happened
in
those
three
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happened
after
they
got
the
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
go
ahead,
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
what
happened
to
that
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
there
ever
been
an
order
that
prevented
you
from
picketing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
have
a
history
of
another
three,
say
you
get
20
more,
whether
you've
got
a
tro
without
notice,
and
you
get
them
all
dismissed
as
soon
as
you
get
into
courts
as
fast
as
you
can
get
counsel
there,
do
they
really
have
an
actual
inhibiting
affect
on
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
know
they
are
going
to
win
all
these
lawsuits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen,
i'm
just
following
up
on
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
supposing
you
just
repeal
the
statute,
would
there
be
any,
be
any
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
give
you
any
of
that
information
or
that
access?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
there
wasn't,
suppose
there
wasn't
what
would
be
the
source
of
any
obligations,
say
i
am
employer
and
i
don't
want
you
on
my
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
could
you
make
the
election
on
your
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
findings
that
all
employers
or
these
are
all
company
towns,
is
there
findings
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you'd
say
that
each
employer
therefore
is
like
a
state,
so
every
part
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
this
statute
just
says
the
board
shall
not
order
you
--
order
access.
justice
john
paul
stevens
case
by
case
analysis
under
marsh
against
alabama
wouldn't
be
before
the
board,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whatever
it
is
but
anyway
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
want
interrupt
your
chain
of
thought
but
i
do
want
to
ask
the
two
questions
about
the
election
procedures
if
i
may,
is
that
—
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
first
of
all
you
said
that
the
election
was
exclusive
means
of
obtaining
recognition,
is
that
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
district
court's
opinion
at
(a)
26
of
the
jurisdiction
statement
points
out
that
before
an
election
could
be
held,
the
union
must
first
demand
and
be
denied
recognition
by
the
employer.
and
i
read
that
i
assume
that
if
the
employer
had
granted
recognition
that
then
they
could
have
proceeded
and
then
that
would
have
been
inadequate
to
enable
the
union
represent
the
employees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
strike?
justice
john
paul
stevens
recognitions,
recognizing
the
strike
would
be
unlawful
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
the
strike
itself,
the
picketing
would
be
illegal,
but
would
the
strike
itself
be
illegal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
stops
the
picketing,
but
does
he
stop
the
strike,
do
necessarily
you
say,
half
the
people
won't
go
to
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one
other
question
on
election
if
i
may,
do
you
agree
that
there
have
been
somewhat
successful
elections?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
agree
the
record
shows
that
there
is
at
least
one
successful
election?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen
what
about
the
fact
if
i
understood
mr.
lee
correctly,
the
one-third
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
have
been
against
employers
for
discriminating
against
employees
engaging
in
union
conduct,
that
can't
be
harmful
to
you,
can
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lee
what
happens
if
there
are
say
10
or
20
of
these
cases
where
the
employer
runs
in
and
gets
a
tro
from
a
county
judge
or
some
place,
and
then
after
they
educate
him
on
the
law
they
get
it
vacated,
and
there
is
never
any
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
they'd
say
that's
more
or
less
what's
been
happening
that
there
isn't
a
practical
deterrent
that
and
they
can't
violate
those
injunctions
during
the
few
days
they
are
outstanding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
rule
65
isn't
specifically
directed
at
first
amendment
protected
activity
as
a
statute
or
at
least
arguably
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
problem
as
i
understand
the
burden
of
mr.
justice
white's
question
is
how
does
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
really
get
to
construe
the
statue
in
this?
well,
it's
on
the
book,
it
does
have
some
deterrent
effect
i
suppose
on
the
first
amendment
--
