we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
babbitt
against
united
farm
workers.
mr.
lee,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

e.

beyond
that
didn't
it
hypothesize
the
number
of
probable
likely
situations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
first
hypothetical
facts
and
then
hypothetical
or
assumptions
about
what
the
act
meant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
had
hardly
claim
that
they
wanted
to
speak
falsely
on
--

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
it
means
by
facilities,
what
do
you
read
under
facilities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
you
just
still
haven't
defined
facilities,
a
building,
a
room?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
building?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
don't
have
a
building?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
district
court
seemed
to
have
some
sort
of
a
general
remand
in
--
not
literally
but
pretty
close
to
it,
to
the
legislature
to
try
again
come
up
with
a
more
balanced
statute
though.
i
gather
you
agreed,
let's
get
that
clear,
the
legislature
might
say,
no
this
is
in
the
light
of
the
district
court
opinion
this
is
just
too
difficult
and
wipe
the
slate
clean,
no
act
at
all.
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
asking
one
question,
can
the
legislature
say
these
judges
have
confused
this
issue
so
much
that
we'll
just
wipe
the
slate
clean,
we'll
repeal
the
entire
statute
and
we
aren't
going
to
enact
any
new
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
what
you
want?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
we
like
let
both
of
you
get
back
to
utah
and
arizona,
the
climate
is
much
better
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
