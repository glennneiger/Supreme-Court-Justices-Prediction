mr.
lee
what
issue
is
it
on
the
elections
where
we
expect
the
difficulty
in
having?
i
mean,
arizona
didn't
have
to
pass
a
law,
give
them
any
election
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
almost
--
international
labor
relations
that
was
constitutionally
mandated
if
one
would
say
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
isn't
this,
for
that
reason
closer
to
california
bankers
association
against
schultz?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
we
refused
to
pass
on
the
aclu's
claim
because
we
said
wait
till
something
happens
to
you
even
though
you
claim
first
amendment
violation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
carroll
was
a
parade,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
rally.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
--
hasn't
this
court
said
that
picketing
is
a
good
deal
more
than
free
speech?
in
another
words,
that's
more
subject
to
regulation
than
straight
out
speech?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
in
the
enforcement
stipulation
that
you
have
been
referring
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
boards
are
â€“
it
was
a
reviewable
on
superior
court
and
judge
hardy
gave
you
some
relief,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it's
a
classically
overbroad
statutory
provision,
one
of
many
statutory
provisions,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
arizona
doesn't
have
to
require
a
grower
to
--
give
any
time,
does
it?
the
constitution
of
united
states
conceivably,
but
certainly
arizona
doesn't
have
to
by
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
the
statute
does
is
say
that
the
grower
has
to
give
certain
access?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
imposes
on
the
grower
some
obligation
to
give--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
powers
the
board
to
impose
[voice
overlap]
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
do
you
contend
that
every
one
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
is
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
how
do
you
justify
the
district
court's
order
enforcing
enjoining
its
enforcement
in
its
entirety?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
federal
court
is
the
best
place
to
examine
that
as
opposed
to
a
state
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
grower
interveners
--
grower
interveners
aren't
the
arizona
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
in
section
1
of
the
arizona
revised
statute
a
general
severability
provision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
you
have
a
general
severability
provision
that
says
any
statute
enacted
in
the
future
by
this
legislature
will
be
considered
severable?
why
would
you
say
that
failure
to
include
a
specific
severability
provision
and
then
subsequently
enacted
statute
wasn't
covered
by
the
general
severability
section.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
it
is
too.
