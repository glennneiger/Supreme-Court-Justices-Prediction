mr.
jerome
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attack
which
the
united
farm
workers
has
made
on
this
statute
is
in
large
part
a
facial
attack
for
overbreadth.
we
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
our
speech
rights
were
suppressed.
there
is
an
enforcement
stipulation,
which
starts
on
page
79
and
goes
through
page
91.
this
has
happened
to
us,
three
temporary
restraining
orders
without
notice
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights
have
been
granted
against
us
before
trial.
the
judicial
proceedings
by
which
this
statute
is
enforced
are
found
on
page
536
of
the
statute
and
on
page
532
of
the
appendix
rather.
“any
person
aggrieved
is
allowed
to
go
to
court
and
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
without
notice
to
stop
speech
activities.”
the
board
and
that
is
section
1393
(a)
and
(b),
that
section
was
invoked
by
a
liquor
store,
item
4,
item
7,
item
13,
page
84
and
88
of
the
enforcement
stipulation,
temporary
restraining
orders
were
gotten.
the
rule
in
this,
that
this
court
articulated
in
1968
in
carroll
versus
president
and
commissioners
of
princess
anne
county
is
that
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights,
there
is
no
place
for
temporary
restraining
orders
without
notice.
rule
65
of
the
arizona
rules
of
civil
procedure
are
incorporated
to
apply
to
this
statute
by
the
face
of
this
statute.
rule
65
provides
that
a
counsel
need
--
need
not
attempt
notice.
he
can
give
reasons
why
notice
should
not
be
required.
we
say
that
that's
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
first
amendment
areas.
on
page
17
of
the
reply
brief
mr.
lee
suggests
that
rule
65
is
not
appreciably
different
from
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
but
the
federal
rules
do
not
apply
to
disputes
between
employees
and
employers.
the
federal
rules
do
not
apply
to
norris–laguardia
--
do
not
preempt
a
norris–laguardia
act,
so
that
many
kinds
of
injunctions
against
speech
cannot
issue
under
the
federal
rule.
this
rule
as
interpreted
by
the
arizona
courts
allows
for
orders
without
notice.
mr.
jerome
cohen
in
those
three
cases
we
were
picketing.
we
were
picketing
the
gallo
wine
company
in
one
of
the
cases
and
the
kennard
liquor
store
went
to
court
in
maricopa
county,
arizona
without
notice
to
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
restrain
our
activities.
mr.
jerome
cohen
the
order
was
then
dismissed
for
lack
of
service.
they
then
went
to
maricopa
county
with
the
distributor,
qv
distributors,
and
they
got
another
order.
mr.
jerome
cohen
okay
and
they
got
another
order,
that's
on
page
88
of
the
enforcement
stipulation,
which
restricted
picketing,
that
order
was
gotten
without
notice.
mr.
jerome
cohen
after
that
order
was
dismissed,
the
case
was
dismissed
on
the
grounds--
mr.
jerome
cohen
has
there
been
an
order
that
prevented
us
from
picketing?
mr.
jerome
cohen
of
temporary
length,
yes.
mr.
jerome
cohen
five
days,
four
days,
i
don't
think
the
length
matters
because
in
carroll,
the
court
said
that
it's
not
the
duration
of
the
order
that
counts.
in
that
case
there
was
a
provision
whereby
the
order
could
be
dissolved
after
five
days,
and
the
court
said
it's
the
fact
of
the
prior
restraint
on
free
speech
no
matter
how
long
that
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes,
they
do.
mr.
jerome
cohen
the
order
is
issued.
it
is
--
it
would
be
contempt
to
violate
the
order
until
we
can
take
steps
to
get
the
order
thrown
out
for
some
reason,
and
we
don't
think
that
that
the
union
or
its
members
should
be
inhibited
for
any
length
of
time.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
justice
rehnquist,
carroll
was
a
rally.
mr.
jerome
cohen
and
justice
fortas
said
that
the
facts
of
a
public
demonstration
are
the
kinds
of
facts
for
which
an
adversary
hearing
is
needed.
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes
justice
rehnquist,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
state
board
got
an
order
which
you'll
find
as
appendix
d
to
the
brief,
which
prevents
us
from
inducing
or
encouraging
the
employee
or
the
manager
of
a
retail
store
from
removing
a
product.
that
is
the
language
of
section
7
of
the
act,
which
is
made
by
section
1392
criminal.
it
is
criminal
to
induce
or
encourage
the
manager
of
a
retail
store
to
take
off
a
product.
if
mr.
chavez
who
is
my
client,
the
president
of
the
farmers
union
were
to
send
a
letter
to
the
manager
of
the
phoenix
safeway
store
for
example
and
say,
“please
take
off
all
lettuce
because
we
are
on
strike
at
sun
harvest,”
that
would
be
inducing
or
encouraging
that
manager
to
remove
that
product,
that
is
a
violation
of
section
(b)
(7)
of
this
act
it's
made
criminal
by
section
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
but
this
facial
attack
and
i
think
it
clearly
falls
within
the
shadow
which
(b)
(7)
cast
over
the
first
amendment.
in
the
enforcement
stipulation
on
page
80,
the
safeway
store
did
go
to
court
and
alleged
violations
of
various
provisions
of
section
1385
(b).
they
got
an
order
restraining
certain
activities.
they
plead
section
7.
now
the
trial
judge
in
that
case
ruled
that
section
7
was
unconstitutionally
vague,
but
the
board,
the
agricultural
labor
relations
board
on
page
81,
you'll
note,
filed
a
charge
alleging
violations
of
section
(b)(6),
(b)(7)
and
(b)(8)
and
they
made
us
defend
and
we
said
it's
unconstitutional,
and
the
board
said
we
don't
have
the
prerogative
to
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
our
own
statute,
which
i
think
points
to
the
fact
why
we're
in
federal
court.
we
have
here
a
problem
where
the
board
can
enforce
the
statute
against
us
and
private
parties
can
enforce
the
statute
against
us.
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes,
but
two
years
later
despite
that
relief,
if
you'll
notice
on
section
--
it's
on
page
85
section
11,
the
board,
despite
what
judge
hardy
did,
went
in
to
try
and
get
another
order
based
on
section
(b)(7)
again,
despite
the
fact
that
a
superior
court
said
it
was
unconstitutional
two
years
before.
we
argued
that,
but
the
board
proceeded
under
the
provisions
of
1390
(k)
which
is
on
page
532
of
the
appendix
and
allows
for
orders
without
notice
and
they
got
the
order
which
we
have
appended
as
appendix
d
to
this
brief.
so
there
have
been,
this
is
not
a
hypothetical
case,
there
have
been
temporary
restraining
orders
issued
without
notice.
section
(b)
(8)
mr.
lee
claims
it
has
never
been
applied.
well
if
you
turn
to
page
102
of
the
appendix,
you'll
find
that
a
judge
looked
at
section
(b)(8)
and
he
looked
at
the
union's
conduct
and
he
said
we
were
in
compliance
with
(b)(8).
now,
i
think
it's
tightrope
walking
on
a
verbal
tightrope
over
a
constitutional
abyss
to
say
that
(b)(8)
has
never
been
applied
because
it
has
not
been
incorporated
in
order,
it
doesn't
mean
that
some
judge
didn't
look
at
the
standards
of
(b)(8)
and
apply
to
our
conduct
and
there
is
some
pertinent
language
from
the
chief
justice
in
organization
for
a
better
austin
versus
keefe,
when
we
talked
in
that
case
it
was
a
question
of
whether
of
leafleting
that
would
tend
to
coerce
a
real
estate
broker
because
of
what
was
alleged
to
be
union
blockbusting
could
be
restrained.
and
you
said
that
in
cases
of
that
kind
there
is
no
room
for
a
test
of
truth
of
validity,
which
further
distinguishes
this
court
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan,
when
the
court
said
that
administrative
bodies,
bureaucrats,
judges
cannot
judge
the
truth
of
validity
of
speech.
ever
since
thorn
hill,
labor
speech
has
been
protected.
it's
more
than
commercial
speech,
we
are
talking
about
our
rights
to
associate,
when
we
boycott
we
raise
issues
of
pesticides.
we
are
talking
about
whether
farm
workers
can
have
a
union.
farm
workers
were
excluded
from
the
national
labor
relations
act
43
years
ago
and
all
we
have
is
the
kind
of
self
help
tools
that
are
implicit
in
a
primary
boycott.
this
statute
makes
it
a
crime
for
us
to
speak.
unless
we
speak
--
permissible
inducement
of
an
ultimate
consumer,
section
(b)(8)
is
prohibited
unless
it
is
truthful,
honest
and
non-deceptive,
and
unless
it
identifies
the
product
with
which
we
have
a
primary
dispute.
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stevens,
mr.
lee
just
said
that
it
does
ban
some
truthful
speech.
it
bans
--
it
would
ban
a
statement
to
say
if
i
said,
for
example,
“boycott
arizona
oranges,
because
arizona
growers
have
substandard
labor”
or
“because
there
are
no
toilets
in
the
field,”
or
“because
they
spray
with
pesticides
and
there
is
not
a
union
contract,”
i
would
be
committing
a
crime
under
section
1392.
i
would
be
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
that's
enjoinable
ex
parte
and
without
notice
and
mr.
lee
admits
that
that's
restricted.
that's
a
classically
overbroad
statute
and
the
court
did
not
take
extensive
testimony
on
it
because
they
asked
the
parties
to
stipulate--
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes,
it
is,
just
as
(b)
(7)
i
submit
is
classically
overbroad
as
well;
(b)(7)
by
prohibiting
all
encouragement.
if
coercive
leaflets
cannot
be
prohibited,
how
could
something
that
encourage
somebody
to
do
something
be
prohibited,
that's
pure
oral
speech,
that
that
language
is
getting
at.
any
discussion
with
the
manager
of
a
retail
store
is
criminal
activity
and
punishable
by
one
year
in
jail
and
up
to
a
$5000
fine
under
section
1392.
in
their
brief,
mr.
lee
and
the
growers
say
well
maybe
this
is
severable.
i
don't
know
that
it's
severable
because
when--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no
we
don't
as
a
mater
of
fact--
mr.
jerome
cohen
it's
been
applied
to
us,
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
cohen
well,
i
think
that
as
to
the
clarity
of
the
statute,
yes
there
maybe
some
other
sections
in
which
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
that's
true;
i
think
we
have
a
case
or
controversy
that
has
been
enforced.
mr.
jerome
cohen
well,
i
would
suggest
that
insofar
as
they
reflect
--
they
relate
to
first
amendment
rights
whether
they
have
to
talk
about
--
whether
we
are
talking
about
speech
in
relationship
to
a
manager
of
a
store
or
speech
in
terms
of
an
ultimate
consumer
for
instance
the
access
provision,
there
are
findings
of
fact
on
the
record
which
the
state
does
not
like,
but
they
do
not,
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
come
here
and
dispute
what
the
trial
court,
what
the
three
judges
found.
their
own
witness,
for
example,
said
that
there
are
farm
workers
who
live
on
migrant
camps
on
company
property.
judge
mickey
took
judicial
notice
of
that
on
page
353.
he'd
had
a
case
just
before
then
when
one
of
the
growers
was
litigating
with
us
about
where
workers
lived.
and
what
the
trial
court
found
was
this
statute,
section
1385(c)
i
believe,
prohibits
the
state
labor
board
from
allowing
--
from
requiring
a
grower
to
give
a
union
time,
materials,
information
or
facilities
with
which
to
communicate
with
workers.
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
what,
i
think
justice
rehnquist
the
problem
that
we
have
with
the
statute
is
that
there
have
been
other
ways
of
organizing
workers
that
were
available
to
farm
workers
before
the
statute.
we
could
engage
in
economic
activity,
we
could
engage
in
the
boycott
which
was
outlawed.
they
replaced
it
with
an
exclusive
election
procedure
which,
as
the
court
found
after
extensive
stipulations
as
to
peak
season
and
after
listening
to
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
and
after
examining
the
stipulation,
there
were
elections.
they
found
that
it
was
the,
and
by
the
language
it's
the
exclusive
means
of
obtaining
recognition.
now,
when
it
becomes
the
exclusive
means
of
obtaining
recognition
and
when
if
the
court
found
we
have
a
transient
workforce
with
high
turnover,
we
have
intermittent,
sporadic
work
it
is
impossible
to
communicate
with
the
workers
without
having
some
access
to
them.
i
think
we
have
here
a
reitman
versus
mulkey
argument
in
that
a
private
decision
by
a
grower
is
made.
he
has
access
to
the
workers
on
his
land,
in
his
camps,
he
can
talk
to
them,
but
the
union
is
precluded
from
getting
on
to
his
property.
i
think
that's
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
this
is
like
the
residential
community
in
marsh
versus
alabama.
this
is
not
like
the
shopping
center
cases.
these
people
live
there
in
isolation
and
they
need
to
make
informed
decisions
about
whether
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
the
statute
says
that
the
grower
is
not
required
to
provide
any
time,
any
information,
any
materials
or
any
facilities
to
allow
the
union
to
communicate.
this
is
one
of
the
differences.
this
act
is
not
by
the
way
pattered
after
the
--.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no
it
does
not
justice
rehnquist.
the
language
is
on
page
515.
it
says
that,
“no
employer
shall
be
required
to
furnish
or
make
available
to
a
labor
organization,”
then
if
you
read
on
down,
“materials,
information,
time
or
facilities
to
enable
such
employer
or
labor
organization
as
the
case
maybe
to
communicate
with
the
employees
of
the
employer.”
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
language
as
i
think
it's
very
well
argued
in
the
amicus
brief,
it
can
only
mean
a
place
at
which
we
could
talk
to
the
workers.
they
take
away
our
time
and
they
don't
say
work
time
or
not
in
time,
they
take
no
time,
no
facilities,
no
materials
and
no
information.
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
it's
a
place,
i
think
it
means
a
place
to
communicate
with
the
workers
in
this
context.
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes,
labor
camp
would
be
a
facility.
mr.
jerome
cohen
they
are
not
required
to
provide
us
with
anything.
they
don't
even
have
to
give
us
a
name,
a
list
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
employees
and
in
a
migrant
situation,
it
will
be
very
important
for
us
to
at
least
under
the
nlra,
for
example,
(inaudible)
rule
gives
us
the
name
and
address
of
the
employees
seven
days
after
an
election.
what
this
statute
says
is
you
can
only
get
the
names
of
the
employees
ten
days
after
the
election.
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
in
that
case
you
would
be
able
to
engage,
there
would
be
a
general
trespass
law
that
would
apply,
you
would
be
able
to
engage
in
a
general
case-by-case
analysis
as
to
whether
there
was
no
--
whether
there
was
or
was
not
alternate
means
of
communicating
with
the
workers.
i
think
what
happens
here
is,
this
is
precluded
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
this
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
the
source
would
be
the
vitality
of
marsh
versus
alabama
and
i
think
that,
i
think
that
marsh
versus
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no
there
is
just,
no
there
isn't.
there's
just
a
statement
that
they
live
in
a
labor
camp
on
the
employer's
property
and
there
are
statements
that
it,
that
they
are
migrant
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
no
i
am
saying
that
we
would
then
be
allowed
in
those
situations
in
which
the
labor
camp
was
enough
like
the
company
town
in
marsh
versus
alabama,
we'd
be
allowed
to
access
in
those
situations.
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
that
kind
of
case
by
case
analysis
and
balancing
is
prohibited
to
this
board
by
this
language
and
when
the
state
does
that
i
think
they
then
intrude
themselves
in
the
process
and
they
allow
the
grower
who
has
total
access.
by
the
way
this
is,
i'd
like
to
just
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
the
board
may
not
require
the
enclosure
therefore
it's
up
to
the
employer.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no
but
i
mean
the
board
is
precluded
for
making
such
an
analysis
under
this
language.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no
i
wouldn't
--
why
would
that
necessarily
follow,
i
would
think
that
the
board--
mr.
jerome
cohen
that
we
would
have
access
to
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
well
i
don't
know
if
it
wouldn't
--
i
think
we'd
have
to
show
the
need
to
communicate
to
those
workers.
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes,
but
when
you
take
a
private
decision
to
refuse
to
give
a
labor
union
information,
time,
materials
or
facilities
and
then
the
state
decides
to
sanction
that
decision,
i
think
then
you
may
have
the
necessary
state
action
to
an
analysis
just
like
reitman
versus
mulkey.
mr.
jerome
cohen
well
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
mr.
justice
white
time
and
again
in
the
statute
the
employer
is
left
free
to
communicate
with
those
workers
or
communicate
with
that
chain
store
owner
and
i
think
the
doctrine
of
mosley
case
i
think
might
apply
here.
i
think
what
we're
seeing
is
the
content
of
speech
is
implicitly
regulated.
the
employer
can
talk
to
those
workers
or
for
instance
in
the
chain
store,
the
employer
can
talk
to
that
chain
store
owner
and
say,
“please
buy
my
products
they
are
grown
at
--
they
are
cheaper
because
i
am
non
union
but
we
are
precluded,”
i
think
the
same
kind
of
analysis
applies
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes,
well
i
am
just
pointing
out
that
what
they've
said
in
the
case
is
they
have
said
that
they
think
–
mr.
jerome
cohen
well
the
compulsory
arbitration
provision
of
1393(b)
i
don't
think
is
bad
for
the
reasons
the
district
court
found
it
to
be
bad.
we
never
argued
that
the
seventh
amendment
applied,
but
i
think
it's
bad
as
a
prior
restraint
because
what
it
says
is
that
upon
proper
application
by
a
grower,
the
board
shall
grant
an
automatic
ten-day
order
restraining
a
strike
to
boycott
or
a
threat
they'll
have.
i
think
what
i
am
saying
is
that
time
and
again
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
i
say
that
to
allow
the
restraining
of
a
strike
or
boycott
without
giving
us
an
opportunity,
i
am
talking
about
section
3093(b),
without
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
have
notice
and
be
there,
that
is
a
prior
restrain.
it
not
only
goes
to
strikes.
however
it
goes
to
boycotts
or
even
a
threat
for
the
boycott.
so
i
think
the
argument
that
i
am
making
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
statute
as
whole
i
think
i
mean
every
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
an
ex
parte
injunction
without
notice
against
picketing
does
violate
the
first
amendment
because
it's
the
burden.
when
you
look
at
the
breadth
of
the
regulation,
the
burden
that
you'd
be
imposing
on
counsel
is
not
a
very
great
one.
it's
a
practical
matter.
that
counsel
knows
he
is
preparing
his
papers
to
enjoin
the
union.
we
are
not
saying
he
has
a
formal
notice.
it
could
be
formal
or
informal.
they
know
the
pickets
are
there.
they
can
give
somebody
a
notice,
pick
up
the
phone,
it
doesn't
stop
him
from
preventing
from
presenting
his
papers,
excuse
me,
but
what
it
does
do,
it
allows
him
to
present
the
facts
without
having
a
participation
by
the
union
and
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
in
a
strike
picketing
situation,
a
boycott
situation
where
you
need
the
notice
first.
the
facts
in
these
matters
are
always
susceptible
of
various
interpretations
and
you
need
both
sides
there
to
have
a
balanced
presentation
of
the
facts.
and
second,
we
need
to
be
there
to
narrowly
tailor
and
pinpoint
that
order,
so
that
we
don't
unnecessarily
encumber
the
first
amendment.
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes.
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes.
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes.
mr.
jerome
cohen
but
mr.
justice
stevens,
i'm
referring
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
section
(a)
5
that
nothing
in
this
article
shall
be
construed
as
requiring
an
agricultural
employer
to
bargain
collectively
until
a
representative
of
his
agriculture
employees
has
been
determined
by
means
of
a
valid
secret
ballot
election.
what
i'm
saying
is
this.
voluntary
recognition
i
think
is
a
precondition,
but
the
other
ways
of
getting
recognition
for
instance
that
the
nlra
has
card
checks
or
the
use
of
economic
power.
so
i
think
we're
--
farm
workers
now
are
in
the
same
situation
that
railway
workers
were
before
1927
or
all
other
workers
were
before
jones
&
laughlin.
the
election
procedure
is
the
only
way
we
could
force
an
employer
to
recognize
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
a
strike
can
be
enjoined
if
you'd
take
a
look
at
section
1385
(b)
12,
it's
another
one
of
those
sections
–
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes.
what
happens
an
employee,
an
employer
in
that
case
could
file
a
petition
under
1389
(c)
and
claim
that
a
claim
was
made
on
him
at
that
point,
all
picketing
becomes
criminal
and
illegal
under
section
1385
(b)
12
and
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
the
strike
itself
could
not
be
used
to
gain
recognition.
we
could
not
strike
in
that
situation
unless
we
had
asked
for
a
majority
vote,
and
we
don't
even
know
what
the
provisions
for
the
majority
vote
would
entail
in
that
case.
by
filing
the
petition,
the
employer
stops
our
activity.
mr.
jerome
cohen
well,
that's
not
clear
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
don't
think
that's
clear.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
there
is
no
--
there's
been
one
election.
the
elections
are
also
in
the
enforcement
stipulation,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
enforcement
stipulation
it
bears
up
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
namely
that
the
election
procedures
are
unworkable.
the
history
of
a
cactus
election
is
an
illustrative
one.
by
the
time
the
hearings
had
been
gone
through
and
set,
the
peak
season
had
expired,
as
the
matter
of
fact
the
employees
had
left,
so
the
teamsters
union,
which
filed
for
the
petition,
withdrew
the
petition.
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes,
it
does,
but
as
mr.
lee
says
in
his
brief,
he
says
that
in
about
22%
of
the
cases
in
the
citrus,
the
election
might
be
--
procedure
might
be
workable.
what
we're
saying
is,
we
think
that
we
have
a
right
to
associate
in
an
effective
and
meaningful
way,
and
when
you
have
as
your
exclusive
means
of
constraining
an
employer
to
recognize
you
in
a
procedure
which
after
extensive
findings
of
fact
as
to
the
length
of
season
in
the
grapes
which
is
three
to
five
weeks,
the
length
in
the
cantaloupes
which
is
three
to
five
weeks,
the
district
court
finds
it's
unworkable,
they
are
saying
on
the
one
hand
you
may
have
it,
but
it's
unworkable
and
we
can't
obtain
our
goal.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
i
think
what
amounts
to
an
unconstitutional
restraint
on
us
in
this
case
is
that
we
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
don't
think
it
would.
i
think
we
only
have
a
constitutional
right
to
attempt
to
get
that
employer
to
recognize
us
and
bargain
with
us.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
mr.
justice
white
our
point
is
that
they
are
not
because
what
have
they
done
to
us?
they
have
taken
away
our
right
to
communicate
with
the
public,
that's
made
criminal.
if
we
picket
and
the
employer
files
a
petition
without
by
the
way
the
protections
of
the
nlra
which
says
if
the
engineers
are
petitioned
against
themselves,
that
is
not
a
bar,
b7
is
not
analogous
to
b12,
they've
deliberately
left
that
out,
they
stop
our
picketing.
if
we
use
the
procedure
by
the
time
we
get
to
a
vote,
if
we
could,
as
the
district
court
found
it's
taken
too
long.
we
can't
get
access
because
the
board
cannot
engage
in
--
we
have
a
disagreement
here,
but
i
think
that
if
we
examine
and
analyze
the
statute,
the
fact
that
there
are
maybe
workers
out
there
in
a
labor
camp
during
a
campaign
we
may
need
to
talk
to
them,
because
they
may
move
on.
we
can't
get
to
the
workers,
we
can't
talk
to
the
public,
we
have
an
unworkable
election
procedure,
and
by
the
way
when
you
look
at
the
sections
1384
and
1385,
you
find
that
if
we
were
to
get
there,
it's
also
criminal
to
coerce,
or
threaten,
or
restrain
an
employer
to
bargain
about
what
the
act
broadly
characterizes
as
management
rights.
and
management
rights
in
this
statute
are
defined
to
include
such
subjects
as
discharge
for
cause,
it
includes
seniority,
i
would
like
to
get
the
language
because
i
think
it
really
reveals
how
unlike
the
nlra
and
how
oppressive
this
is
to
us.
we
can't
bargain
about
hiring,
suspension,
discharge
or
transfer
of
employees.
mr.
jerome
cohen
i'm
saying
that
all
these
things
taken
together
amount
to
what
i
think
is
the
test.
is
it
a
substantial
restraint
on
our
right
to
associate
and
i
think
when
you
make
that
an
unworkable
exclusive
election
procedure
the
only
way
to
force
an
employer
to
get
recognition,
when
you
take
away
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
what
we
claim
is
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
what
we
have
is
that
right
which
in
the
railroad
case
in
1927,
i
believe
in
jones
&
laughlin,
i
think
farmers
could
still
have
that
right,
we
are
still
back
in
that
junk,
and
well
i
think
we
have
the
right
to
associate
together
to
try
to
improve
our
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
say
and
--
it's
a
lot
of
different
talking
here
then
it
is
on
gabilan
street
in
salinas
california,
so
i
know
i'm
not
saying
it
as
well
as
i
should.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
everything
that
we
do,
if
we
try
to
boycott,
it's
made
criminal.
if
we
talk
to
a
manager
of
a
store,
which
has
been
our
traditional
tactic
and
we
still
desire
to
do
it,
it's
made
criminal
and
you
can
enjoin
it.
if
we
try
to
talk
about
pesticides,
if
we
try
to
talk
about
the
things
mentioned
in
1384
and
1385,
we
can't
talk
about
it
at
the
table.
if
we
try
to
have
an
election
procedure
with
limited
resources
that
we
have,
the
time
runs
out
on
us.
so
even
those
sort
of
pre-law
rights
that
all
other
workers
had,
we'd
rather
have
those
than
a
law
which
forces
us.
as
the
court
said,
this
law
is
the
perversion
of
the
stated
goal
in
the
procedure,
the
stated
goal
is
to
give
us
a
freedom
to
organize,
this
law
doesn't
do
that.
it
creates
a
barrier
to
that.
that
i
think
is
the
gist
of
our
argument.
at
every
step,
everything
that
we
try
do
we
lose
out
and
there
is
unrebutted
testimony
in
the
record
from
pages
397
to
400
of
the
appendix
that
we
lost
contracts
after
this
law
was
passed,
that
membership
declined.
the
wages
and
benefits
were
adversely
affected,
that
the
numerous
lawsuits
and
temporary
restraining
orders
not
only
directly
affected
us,
and
here
is
where
i
think
maybe
i
misspoke
myself
earlier
mr.
justice
white,
but
it
has
a
chilling
effect
on
our
supporters.
i
would
like
to
give
you
an
example
of
that
maybe
we
should
talk
about
that
because
it
means
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
in
the
overbreadth,
i'm
saying
what
happens
when
someone
looks
at
a
statute
that
says
i
can't
induce
or
encourage
manager
to
ask
him
to
take
a
good
off
that
has
been
directly
used
against
us,
but
we've
lost
boycott
support
for
that
and
there
is
testimony
to
that
effect.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
we
are
not
saying
that's
harmful
to
us.
we
are
saying
that
unbalanced,
if
there
is
a
careful
reading
of
this
act
that
it
really
doesn't
sugarcoat
the
pill.
i
mean
the
pill
is
there
and
it's
going
to
kill
us
because
so
many
of
our
economic
tools
are
stripped
from
us,
and
by
the
way,
that
it
just
doesn't
balance,
it
doesn't
make
the
difference.
that
election
was
a
consent
election
and
it
was
in
a
dairy
where
there
was
year
around
employment.
i
think
that
further
illustrates
the
point
that
we
are
trying
to
make.
the
state
has
made
an
issue
of
abstention
in
this
case,
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
in
anticipating
what
mr.
lee
might
say
on
rebuttal
that
i
don't
think
abstention
would
be
proper
here
because
the
language
that
we
are
challenging
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights
is
very
clear.
it
clearly
prohibits
truthful
speech.
it
clearly
prohibits
us
from
talking
to
people.
this
gets
nowhere
near
tree
fruits
where
the
issue
was
whether
you
were
picketing
a
store.
in
your
dissent
mr.
justice
stewart
you
said
if
there
were
no
available
ways
of
communicating
with
the
store,
then
you
might
not
be
able
to
ban
picketing.
this
bans
all
ways
of
communicating
with
the
store
and
i
think
it's
clear
on
its
face.
there
is
a
number
of
defects.
it's
not
our
fault.
i
know
the
brief
is
long,
but
i
think
the
issues,
each
issue
in
and
of
itself
with
the
exception
of
the
access
issue
is
fairly
simple
and
straightforward.
we
don't
think
you
can
ban
truthful
speech.
we
don't
even
think
you
could
ban
false
speech
because
you
need
robust
debate
in
this
society
especially
in
a
labor
dispute.
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
between
the
labor
board
and
the
superior
court.
that
means
that
we
are
in
the
procedural
maze
and
as
in
examination
of
items
2a
through
2f
of
the
safeway
series
of
litigation
shows
even
as
justice
rehnquist's
question
illustrated
even
though
the
superior
court
had
appellate
review
in
effect
over
that
board,
they
continue
to
enforce
an
unconstitutional
statute
after
that.
there
is
no
certification
procedure
here,
so
there
is
no
fast
way
of
getting
a
resolution.
i
think
congress
gives
us
the
right
under
section
13,
i
mean
1893,
i
forgot
the
statute
to
file
for
the
–
for
our
federal
constitutional
rights
in
federal
court
and
that's
we've
done
and
i
don't
think
that
we
need
to
go
to
state
court.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no.
mr.
jerome
cohen
well,
i
think
it
hinges--
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
it
hinges
on
whether
or
not
it's
separable
or
not
and
i
think
that
the
intent
of
the
legislature
should
be
examined.
the
legislature
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
when
it's
clear
on
its
face,
yes.
the
grower,
interveners
in
paragraph
two
of
their
motion
to
intervene,
characterize
this
as
a
comprehensive
statute
to
totally
regulate
that
had
as
its
basis
that
for
that
regulation
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
chapter,
a
criminal
section.
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
but
the
arizona
legislature
did
not
put
a
severability
clause
and
even
though
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
one
and
i
think
that
does
say
something
about
their
intent.
they
looked
at
a
general
scheme
and
they
deliberately
left
it
out.
mr.
jerome
cohen
but
i
think
that
that
general
severability
provision
would
not
apply
to
a
more
specific
statute.
when
the
legislature
constructed
a
statute
i
think
when
you
look
at
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that's
a
very
good
question.
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
have
an
answer
to
it,
right
and
my
answer
is
this.
they
were
looking
at
a
general
scheme
for
labor
legislation.
that
general
scheme
was
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
national
labor
relations
act
contained
a
severability
clause,
they
left
it
out.
i
think
that
says
something
more
immediate.
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
they
did
need
it
to
make
their
intent
clear
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
when
you,
if
you
mr.
justice
white
if
you
read
this
statute
and
look
at
for
instance
their
inhibitions
on
boycott,
they
say
in
their
declaration
of
policy
that
it
is
a
state
policy
and
there
is
a
need
to
inhibit
a
boycott.
now
i
claim
and
i
think
upon
examination
you'll
agree
that
you
cannot
ban
truthful
speech
that
you
cannot
ban
all
discussions
with
the
manager.
so
with
all
the
inhibitions
on
the
boycott
disappear,
do
you
think
that
the
legislature
would
let
cesar
chavez
and
the
farm
workers
run
around
unfettered,
and
boycott
it
and
boycott
people,
i
don't
think
they
would,
i
don't
think
they
would.
i
think
that
the
prohibition,
i
think
by
giving
an
employer
the
right
to
ban
picketing
upon
the
filing
of
a
petition
that
he
himself
could
engineer,
i
think
if
they
struck
that
down,
if
you
struck
that
down,
they
wouldn't
want
to
stand.
i
think
if
you
took
out
the
procedures,
how
can
the
procedures
of
this
act
1390k,
and
1393a
and
b,
which
is
we've
said
over
and
over
again
provide
for
tros
without
notice
in
the
area
for
first
amendment
rights,
if
you
take
out
the
enforcement
procedures
would
the
legislature
allow
it
to
stand?
i
think
it
depends
on
what
sections
are
found
unconstitutionally
i
guess
is
my
answer.
mr.
jerome
cohen
[attempt
to
laughter]
well,
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
in
and
of
itself?
mr.
jerome
cohen
may
be
not
severable,
but
together
with
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no,
i
am
assuming
that
you
are
correct
in
your
analysis.
mr.
jerome
cohen
it
would
depend
on
the
sections.
mr.
jerome
cohen
well,
i
would
rather
categorize
it
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
no
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
jerome
cohen
well,
i
am
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
mr.
justice
white
i
am
assuming
that
what
justice
rehnquist
says
is
correct.
i
would
not
like
to
make
that
assumption
however
i
think
that,
i
don't
think
it
applies
in
this
case.
i
think
they
were
designing
a
statute,
and
when
you
look
at
the
declaration
of
policy
you
see
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
they
were
trying
to
stop
strikes,
they
were
trying
to
stop
boycotts,
so
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
it
struck
down.
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
the
whole
statute--
mr.
jerome
cohen
that's
i
think
in
the
past.
mr.
jerome
cohen
the
election
procedure
was
found
unconstitutional.
mr.
jerome
cohen
as
impressed
upon
agriculture,
at
the
heart
of
the
statute
yes
if
the
election
procedure
falls,
i
think
the
district
court
is
right,
the
rest
of
it
must
fall.
if
the
boycott
procedures
fall,
i
don't
think
the
legislature
would
have
allowed
it
to
stand,
that's
right,
because
i
think
what
they
were
trying
to
do
to
balance
our
power
against
their
power.
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes.
mr.
jerome
cohen
you
are
assuming
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
election
procedure
in
that
question?
mr.
jerome
cohen
i
think
without
an
election
procedure,
you
have
no
statute.
mr.
jerome
cohen
well
they
could
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
not
saying
that
they
can't
experiment.
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
that
they
--
mr.
jerome
cohen
yes
they
could
do
that,
yes
they
could.
mr.
jerome
cohen
[attempt
to
laughter]
it's,
we're
not
see
it's
not
–
we
are
not
saying
that
the
california
act
is
constitutionally
mandated
or
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
constitutionally
mandated.
we're
saying
that
when
you
look
at
the
inhibitions
first
on
the
speech
to
consumers,
then
on
the
access
to
the
workers
and
speech
to
workers,
we're
saying
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
that
it
falls
below
that
ground
floor
under
which
a
state
can't
experiment,
that's
what
we're
saying.
i
think
that
i'd
like
to
sum
up
by
saying
first
that
as
to
all
the
sections
i
don't
think
we
need
actual
enforcement
as
to
each
and
every
section
to
have
a
case
or
controversy
to
allow
this
court
to
examine
those
sections.
those
sections
as
to
which
we
have
actual
enforcement
happen
to
be
the
most
blatantly
unconstitutional
sections.
i
think
that's
clear.
the
threat
of
enforcement,
we
are
in
a
much
stronger
position
then
the
doctor
in
doe
v.
bolton
or
the
teacher
in
epperson,
or
the
vendor
of
real
estate
in
linmark.
this
is
designed
to
hit
our
activities.
broadrick
doesn't
apply
here
because
these
activities
are
speech
activities
within,
not
within
legitimate
suite
of
the
statute,
it's
not
conduct.
so
i
think
that
we
have
the
right
to
ask
that
each
and
every
section
be
examined
not
only
under
threat
of
prosecution,
but
because
the
criminal
section
makes
this
an
overbroad
criminal
statute,
because
each
and
every
violation
of
every
section
of
this
statute
is
a
crime.
thank
you.
