justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
boggs,
i'm
sure
that
all
of
us
trained
as
lawyers
would
probably
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
statement
that
“you
may
presume”
and
“you
may
infer.”
do
you
think
the
average
juror
really
gets
much
of
a
difference
between
those
two
sentences?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
boggs,
let
me
take
you
back
once
more
to
the
instruction
which
you
complain
of
which
is
i
guess
on
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
your
brief.
the
law
presumes
that
a
person
intends
the
ordinary
consequences
of
his
voluntary
acts.
what
if
instead
of
that
the
court
had
instructed,
you
may
infer
that
a
person
intends
the
ordinary
consequences
of
his
voluntary
acts?
do
you
think
there
will
be
constitutional
question
raised?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you'd
have
no
objection
to
instruction
no.
9?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
harmless
error
doctrine
in
montana
as
--
does
the
montana
supreme
court
ever
hold
that
the
failure
to
give
of
our
giving
an
improper
instruction
was
harmless
error?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
confessed
and
this
confession
was
introduced
against
him,
was
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
was
the
theory
of
your
defense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
looking
at
page
11
of
the
appendix
with
the
paragraph,
“and
she
started
to
wheel
her
wheelchair
and
i
got
scared
and
didn't
know
what
to
do,
there
was
a
knife
laying
on
the
counter
so
i
grabbed
that
and
stabbed
her.
i
stabbed
her
in
the
back
five
times.”
now
with
a
confession
like
that
does
it
really
make
too
much
difference
how
finally
tuned
the
instruction
of
the
judges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
all
i
was
submitted
to
the
jury
for
their
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
--
which
is
the
more
aggravated
of
the
two
crimes,
purposely
or
knowingly?i
don't
know
that
they
can
be
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
requires
the
more
specific
degree
of
intent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
an
indictment
charge,
just
deliberate
homicide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
jury
finds
it
was
--
in
this
case
the
jury
didn't
make
any
finding
as
to
purposely
or
knowingly.
is
it
--does
a
judge
sometimes
require
them
to
find
that
it
was
done
either
purposely
or
knowingly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
a
finding
of
either
one
sufficient
to
support
and
in
the
sentence
is
simply
the
minimum
or
maximum
sense
is
provided
for
the
offense
of
deliberate
homicide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
operative
effect
does
it
have
when
the
jury
comes
on
and
simply
finds
a
verdict
of
deliberate
homicide,
no
separate
verdicts
are
requested
as
whether
it
was
purposeful
or
deliberate,
what
operative
effect
does
it
have
on
your
client?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i'm
telling
about
is
practical
effect
on
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
montana
practice
permit
the
requesting
of
separate
--
of
a
submission
of
a
verdict
asking
the
jury
to
decide
whether
they
find
it
to
be
purposeful
or
knowingly?
