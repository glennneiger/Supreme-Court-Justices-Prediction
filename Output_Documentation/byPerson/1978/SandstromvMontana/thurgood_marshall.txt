justice
thurgood
marshall
was
this
instruction
given
to
the
jury
which
you
now
read?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
guess
that's
immaterial.
justice

marshall
but
how
is
that
part
of
the
jury?
the
jury
uses
its
own
--
each
one
of
the
jurors
uses
his
individual
interpretation
of
purpose,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
that's
what
it
mean.
