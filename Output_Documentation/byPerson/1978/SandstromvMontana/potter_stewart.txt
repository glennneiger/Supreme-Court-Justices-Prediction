justice
potter
stewart
but
the
judge
thought
there
was
a
jury
case
for
purpose
--
on
purpose,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
that
the
jury
is
the
judge
of
the
facts
which
it
determines
on
all
the
admissible
evidence
in
the
case.
but
it
--
2as
to
the
law
it
gets
his
instruction
from
the
trial
judge.
and
this
instruction
wasn't
that
the
law
allows
you
to
presume
or
permits
you
to
infer,
it
says
the
law
presumes
and
that
was
the
law
as
the
jury
was
instructed.
the
law
presumes
that
a
person
intends
the
ordinary
consequences
of
his
voluntary
acts
and
that
would
require
them.
if
they
were
--
that
their
duty
as
jurors
to
take
the
law,
it
was
given
to
him
by
the
trial
judge
to
find
this
person
guilty
of
intentional,
purposeful
homicide,
if
the
law
presumes
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
would
they
even
turn
to
the
alternative
after
being
told
this
by
the
trial
judge
if
the
law
presumes
this?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
law
--
we're
told
that
the
law
presumes
it,
that
a
person
intends
and
these
were
voluntary
acts,
--
there's
no
question
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
were
told
that
that
was
the
required
result
of
the
law
of
montana
as
given
to
them
by
the
trial
judge
in
these
instructions.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
to
make
it
even
--
does
that
make
it
better?
justice
potter
stewart
the
law
tells
you
to
do
this?
the
law
presumes
it.
not
the
law
entitles
you
to
presume
it
or
authorizations
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
infer
it
but
that
the
law
itself
presumes
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
capital
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
attorney
general
has
told
us
that
this
instruction
is
no
longer
given
in
criminal
cases
in
montana.
did
you
acknowledge
the
truth
in
the
accuracy
of
that
statement?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
help
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
the
cases
you
cite
in
your
brief
from
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
as
i
saw
them,
all
indicated
disapproval
with
this
sort
of
instruction
and
said
to
the
district
courts
in
their
respective
circuits,
don't
do
this
anymore
but
didn't
reverse
the
convictions,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
looking
at
page
21,
it's
not
the
second
circuit
and
the
third
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
they've
all
been
just
admonitions
not
to
do
it
anymore,
haven't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
--
on
that
ground?
