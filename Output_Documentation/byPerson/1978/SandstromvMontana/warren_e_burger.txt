we'll
hear
arguments
in
sandstrom
against
montana.
mr.
boggs
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.
burger
that
has
not
prevented
the
courts
generally
from
holding
that
the
possession
--
evidence
of
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
for
example
permits
a
jury
to
draw
the
inference
that
the
possessor
was
also
the
thief,
has
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
find
any
fault
with
that
kind
of
an
instruction
in
the
civil
case,
i
take
it
although
that
question
is
not
before
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
purposely
have
some
kind
of
notations
of
motivation
to
a
greater
extent
than
knowingly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
--
it
is
appropriate
to
define
them
separately
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
the
subject
of
rebuttable
presumptions
in
the
legal
context
something
that
we
would
ever
expect
that
generally
known
to
the
public
members
of
the
juries
unless
the
judge
has
instructed
them
on
it
as
mr.
justice,
my
colleague
has
just
suggested
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
difficult
and
to
offer
them
to
grasp
the
ones
they
are
instructed
about,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
don't
think
the
instructions
13
and
14
on
the
others
that
you
must
be
convinced
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
offsets
and
takes
care
of
this
presumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
stage
in
the
proceeding
was
the
insanity
defense
abandoned?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
relied
during
the
extent
now
on
the
psychiatric
testimony
or
on
his
conviction,
are
you
then
indirectly
suggesting
a
diminished
responsibility
idea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
greely,
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
information,
mr.
attorney
general,
is
in
the
disjunctive
purposely
or
knowingly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
instruction
--
mr.
attorney
general
in
no.
15,
they
cleanup
the
final
catchall
instruction.
you
are
to
draw
no
conclusions
or
inferences
from
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
not
testified
of
the
--
went
through
the
process
of
analysis
that
we
perhaps
mistakenly
assumed
that
they
do,
wouldn't
they
get
some
ideas
under
instruction
no.
15
but
they
could
not
draw
any
conclusions
or
inferences
or
presumptions
from
the
fact
the
defendant
didn't
take
the
witness
stand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
the
risk,
i
take
it
you
concede.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
the
risk
that
once
the
jury
has
found
that
the
act
was
voluntary
which
they
would
find
from
defining
that
it
was
purposeful.
then
the
next
step
is
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
almost
automatic.
at
least,
that
is
the
risk
that
they
would
think
it
out
that
way
if
the
juries
indeed
do
for
that
sort
of
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
more
subtle
though,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
boggs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
isn't
binding
on
the
trial
judges
i
suppose
the
attorney
general
can't
enforce
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
request,
he
can
merely
direct
his
county
attorneys.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
