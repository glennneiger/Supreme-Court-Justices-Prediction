mr.
byron
w.
boggs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
law
of
this
nation
has
always
been
at
the
criminal
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
innocence.
this
court
has
ruled
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
protects
the
criminal
defendant
against
conviction
except
upon
proof
of
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
as
to
each
fact
necessary
to
constitute
the
charge.
the
court
has
further
held
at
the
state
carrying
this
burden
may
not
shift
the
burden
to
the
defendant
such
as
by
presumption.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
there
is
a
difference
between
permitting
a
jury
to
infer
and
telling
them
that
they
are
to
presume
or
telling
them
that
the
law
presumes
and
the
difference
is
critical
to
the
right
for
trial
by
jury
upon
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
think
that
any
juror
or
literate
layperson
knows
the
difference
between
the
word
“may”
and
the
word
“shall”
or
the
difference
between
the
word
“may
infer”
and
the
phrase
“the
law
presumes.”
i
think
they
know
there
is
a
difference.
they
might
differ
as
to
exactly
how
they
would
describe
that
difference.
but
in
general
the
difference
between
those
terms
would
be
a
difference
significant
and
at
the
heart
of
the
reasoning
process
of
a
jury.
they
may
infer,
allowing
them
to
reason
as
you
were
inviting
them
to
reason.
they
shall,
or
the
law
presumes
phrase
prohibiting
them
from
reasoning.
petitioner
was
charged
with
the
crime
deliberate
homicide.
the
crime
deliberate
homicide
under
montana
law
has
the
element
that
the
defendant
shall
have
caused
a
death
and
that
he
shall
have
caused
that
death
purposely
or
knowingly.
and
the
montana
supreme
court
has
said
that
those
terms
purposely
or
knowingly
embody
the
concept
(inaudible).
it
stood
admitted
in
the
case
both
by
written
confession
and
by
myself
in
open
court
as
petitioner's
attorney
that
there
had
been
a
doubt
that
had
resulted
as
a
consequence
of
the
acts
of
petitioner.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
would
see
no
fault
with
the
instruction
in
a
civil
case
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
i
would
note
that
the
instruction
as
given
in
this
case
would
not
conform
that
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
pertaining
to
civil
trials.
as
i
read
rule
301.2
pertain
the
civil
trials
the
most
that
could
be
instructed
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
was
that
the
jury
may
infer
a
presumed
fact.
but
that
is
strictly
aside
from
the
argument
that
i
present
to
you
which
is
based
on
this
court's
rulings
as
to
criminal
trials
and
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
only
question
in
the
case
if
i
may
say,
the
reason
where
the
jury
is
being
invited
to
the
courtroom
listen
to
the
evidence
was
to
determine
the
factual
question
as
to
the
mental
state
of
the
petitioner
at
the
time
he
engaged
in
the
fatal
acts.
the
question
of
whether
he
had
acted
purposely
or
knowingly
was
fairly
raised
by
the
evidence
in
the
written
confession
which
constituted
the
state's
case
together
with
collaborating
evidence
while
admitting
that
the
death
had
been
caused
by
the
petitioner.
in
no
instance
states
that
he
intended
to
kill
her,
that
he
wanted
to
kill
her,
that
he
knew
that
she
was
dying.
not
once
is
the
word
death
mentioned.
the
facts
of
the
confession
stood
as
the
basis
for
the
opinion
from
a
psychiatrist
and
a
psychologist
both
of
whom
examined
petitioner
and
informed
opinions
concerning
his
personality,
his
intelligence
and
informed
opinions
as
to
his
mental
state
at
the
time
of
the
fatal
acts.
and
their
opinions
offered
for
the
jury's
benefit
were
that
he
had
not
intended
to
cause
the
death.
that
he
did
not
have
the
death
in
his
view
at
that
time.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
don't
think
so.
let
me
say
in
that
regard
that
the
instruction
was
given
in
addition
to
the
instruction
of
which
i
complain
which
said
in
its
instruction
no.
9
on
page
36
of
the
appendix.
that
purpose
and
knowledge
are
manifested
by
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
offense.
purpose
and
knowledge
may
not
be
proved
by
direct
evidence
but
may
be
inferred
from
acts,
conduct
and
circumstances
appearing
in
evidence
and
i
would
say
that
would
be
substantially
the
same
as
the
instruction
that
you
just
raised.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
have
only
one
objection
to
it.
it's
not
a
constitutional
dimensions.
the
objection
i
have
is
the
word
“are”
in
the
first
line
rather
than
the
word
“maybe”.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes,
knowingly
in
the
sense
that
he
was
aware
at
that
time.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
well,
--
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
it
is
most
clearly
identified
with
purpose,
mr.
justice
white,
but
it
would
bother
me
as
to
knowingly
also
--
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
--
and
for
this
reason.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
that's
true.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
that's
true.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
but
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
could
pursue
that
for
a
moment
the
crime
is
the
liberate
homicide.
the
verdict
was
guilty
of
deliberate
homicide.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
but
the
official
code
comment
to
the
section
states
that
this
section
deals
only
with
acts
done
deliberately
that
is
purposely
or
knowingly.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
no,
i
don't
say
that
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
this,
the
concept
of
knowingly
in
the
context
of
deliberate
homicide
must
surely
be
that
the
individual
has
an
awareness
that
he
is
causing
the
death
at
the
time
he
is
causing
it
in
such
circumstances
as
he
might
turn
away
from
the
consequence.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
they
are
certainly
related.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes,
the
--
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
think
there
are
two
attempts
at
getting
at
the
same
concept
albeit
different
evidence.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
don't
disagree
with
that
but
i
only
say
that
the
instruction
--
the
argument
of
course
is
not
necessary
for
my
position
because
if
the
jury
followed
the
instruction
and
presumed
purpose
then
they
didn't
have
to
ask
themselves
the
question
did
he
act
knowingly?
for
they
had
found
sufficiency
on
that
basis
of
that
presumption
to
convict.
but
supposing
as
mr.
justice
white
had
said
that
the
crime
did
not
even
contain
the
term
purposely
and
the
only
question
was
did
this
instruction
prejudice
the
issue
unknowingly,
i
think
it
tends
to
prejudice
that
issue
because
the
concept
of
intent
and
knowledge
are
interrelated.
that's
--
that
was
the
only
point
i
wanted
to
make
in
that
regard.
the
--
as
i
had
stated,
the
question
was
fairly
presented
as
a
question
of
fact
for
jury
determination.
the
instruction
complaint
of
spoke
directly
to
that
question.
the
meaning
of
the
instruction
is
that
the
jury
should
not
reason
from
the
evidence
to
a
conclusion
of
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt
but
rather
should
accept
the
fact
presumed
without
proof.
i
believe
that
that
would
be
closed
if
not
i
think
that's
a
very
fair
statement
of
the
common
understanding
of
the
term
presume.
the
--
of
course
the
law
of
presumptions
is
not
simple
and
jurisdictions
differ
as
to
it.
but
the
law
of
the
state
of
montana
as
to
presumptions
is
clear
and
direct
and
it
is
setout
in
the
rules
of
evidence
that
were
applicable
to
this
trial.
it
is
stated
in
rule
301
at
the
montana
rules
of
evidence
that
a
presumption
is
an
assumption
of
fact
that
the
law
requires
to
be
made.
this
presumption
is
stated
to
be
a
disputable
presumption
and
as
to
disputable
presumptions,
the
rule
in
montana,
in
rule
301
(b)
is
that
a
disputable
presumption
may
be
overcome
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
contrary
to
the
presumption
unless
the
presumption
is
overcome
the
trier
of
fact
must
find
the
assumed
fact
in
accordance
with
the
presumption.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
no.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
if
there
is
any
question
as
to
how
the
public
mind
might
interpret
presumptions.
if
it
is
brought
that
the
purpose
--
the
interpretations
of
a
law
might
have
influenced
the
jury's
consideration
of
the
meaning
of
the
instruction
then
i
believe
the
rule
states
what
that
meaning
would
be.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
we
cannot
assume
that
the
jury
knew
what
this
rule
was.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
on
the
other
hand,
we
cannot
be
sure
that
at
least
one
of
them
didn't
know
that.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
feel
confident
in
saying
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
jury
is
not
going
to
know
the
convolutions
and
details
of
the
law
of
rebuttable
presumptions.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
wouldn't
think
that
this
particular
instruction
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
grasp.
some
would
perhaps
be,
but
this
one
would
not.
but
i
certainly
would
say
that
they
would
not
know
the
law
of
presumptions.
that
does
not
mean
however
that
they
would
not
be
somehow
influenced
by
the
clear
statement
of
what
a
presumption
means
in
the
state
of
montana
as
it
is
contained
in
rule
301
which
was
a
codification
of
the
prior
existing
statutes
and
stated
the
case
law
rule
as
well.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
no,
i
don't
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
believe
that
the
montana
supreme
court
itself
in
its
second
opinion
in
state
of
montana
v.
mckenzie
stated
better
than
i
could
why
that
instruction
would
not
cure
the
air
contained
in
instruction
no.
5
and
that
is
when
they
said
that
yes,
the
state
carries
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
the
presumption
is
a
means
by
which
that
proof
can
be
shouldered
and
paraphrasing
not
quoting.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
again,
i
think
it
is
likely
that
the
jury
would
believe
that
the
instruction
no.
4,
followed
directly
by
instruction
no.
5
were
compatible
in
the
law
that
they
were
believed
as
i
believe
that
the
court
was
capable
of
stating
a
blatant
contradiction
one
right
after
the
other
would
shake
their
belief
in
the
consistency
and
fairness
of
the
law.
and
i
believe
that
they
would
think
that
instruction
no.
5
was
to
be
read
as
compatible.
it
was
to
be
read
as
a
means
by
which
instruction
no.
4
could
be
satisfied.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
the
theory
of
the
defense
was
that
the
statements
that
as
contained
in
the
confession
were
not
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
but
he
acted
purposely
or
knowingly.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
your
honor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
based
on
that
same
language,
two
court
appointed
mental
health
experts
acting
independently
of
one
another
came
to
a
conclusion
that
he
did
not
act
purposely
or
knowingly.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes.
beyond
that,
might
i
say
that
this
court
has
ruled
in
a
different
case
or
a
man
was
stabbed
30
times
that
no
matter
how
strongly
the
court
may
believe
that
the
elements
of
the
crime
are
made
out,
that
cannot
deprive
the
defendant
of
the
right
of
a
properly
instructed
jury.
but
that's
not
the
same
case
as
we
have
because
as
i
told
you
those
same
facts
were
the
basis
of
two
independent
assessments
that
said
the
elements
of
the
crime
were
not
made
out.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
the
insanity
defense
was
of
course
first
raised
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
we
had
a
preparing
before
the
court
of
the
issue
of
insanity
at
which
time
the
experts
stated
their
view
of
the
man
was
sane
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
at
that
time
the
defense
was
abandoned.
and
i
informed
the
jury
and
the
court
that
it
was
formally
--
i
formally
informed
it
was
abandoned
at
the
time
i
opened
the
remarks.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
no.
and
i
am
admitting
that
petitioner
have
the
capacity
to
form
the
mental
elements
required.
the
defenses
that
he
did
not
form
those
elements
that
is
that
he
was
sane,
now,
he
was
--
had
a
certain
personality
makeup
that
led
itself
perhaps
to
the
situation.
but
i
am
not
saying
that
it
was
such
that
it
pervaded
him
from
having
a
capacity
to
form
the
mental
elements
required
for
this
crime.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
they
were
instructed
that
they
could
not
consider
the
defense
of
insanity.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
was
bound
by
it.
i
had
invited
it
by
my
own
remarks.
the
jury
was
assembled
to
determine
the
factual
question,
the
presumption
told
them
that
the
law
presumed
what
their
conclusion
was
to
be
and
by
so
instructing
them
it
deprived
petitioner
of
due
process
of
law
in
depriving
him
of
a
jury
determination
of
guilt
based
on
all
of
the
evidence
upon
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
that
is
my
case.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
if
i
may.
i
wanted
to
pursue
a
point
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised
and
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
asked
which
was
the
worst
crime?
to
purposely
take
a
life
or
knowingly
take
a
life?
and
the
commentators
to
the
code
enacted
in
1973,
originated
this
language
state
that
purposely
is
the
worst
crime.
it
is
the
equivalent
of
the
premeditated
homicide
in
the
common
law.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
well,
this
is
the
reason
i
wanted
to
pursue
that
point.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
because,
i
think
it
has
due
process
implications.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes.
with
the
general
verdict,
guilty
of
deliberate
homicide
based
on
the
information
stated
in
the
disjunctive,
the
sentencing
judge
then
is
prepared
or
may
sentence
either
a
minimum
or
the
maximum.
that's
i
believe
you
observed.
and
of
course
the
maximum
was
100
years
in
prison.
now,
if
i
understood
the
attorney
general
correctly,
he
has
said
that
he
thought
the
jury
probably
concluded
that
petitioner
did
not
intend
to
kill
and
i
would
say,
well
he
did
not
act
purposely
then,
and
that
is
the
worst
crime.
but
under
the
general
verdict,
the
judge
could
sentence
to
the
maximum
and
i
argue
to
the
judge
at
sentencing
that
there
was
not
the
elements
of
premeditation
and
the
premeditated
murder
have
been
considered
the
worst
crime
in
our
tradition.
and
that
he
should
consider
a
lesser
penalty
than
the
maximum
penalty
based
on
that
proposition.
and
he
sentenced
him
to
the
maximum
penalty
--
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
--
100
years.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
it
is
not
applicable
under
the
facts
i
stated.
the
prosecution
attempted
to
place
the
case
within
the
context
of
the
capital
punish
--
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
but
the
judge
took
it
away
from
the
jury.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
in
this
case
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
within
in
his
(voice
overlap).
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
that's
right.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
know
of
no
precedent
for
that.
although
after
arguing
this
case
i
think
i
might
pursue
one.
now,
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
instruction
the
law
presumes,
the
person
intends
you
under
consequences
and
voluntary
act
shifted
the
burden
of
production
and
this
is
in
the
opinion,
the
montana
supreme
court.
the
--
unfortunately,
it
doesn't
make
sense
in
this
case.
the
burden
of
production
would
have
required
in
the
montana
supreme
court
said
it
would
have
required
the
defendant
to
have
produced
some
evidence
contrary
to
effect
presumed.
but
in
characterizing
the
defense
evidence,
it
characterized
it
as
being
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
may
not
have
intended
the
death.
so
by
it's
own
characterization
it
certainly
called
it
some
evidence
contrary
to
the
fact
presumed.
so
there
was
a
contradiction
inherent
in
that
position.
finally,
of
course
in
that
regard
the
jury
was
not
told
that
that
was
the
requirement
under
that
instruction.
if
i
understand
the
law
of
those
jurisdictions
that
interpret
presumptions
are
shifting
the
burden
of
production
and
requiring
the
production
of
some
evidence
and
we
have
some
of
those
with
regard
to
affirmative
defenses
in
montana.
it
is
that
once
the
--
some
evidence
has
been
produced,
then
the
jury
is
directed
to
weigh
the
evidence
according
to
the
applicable
burden
of
persuasion
which
of
course
would
have
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
and
there
would
have
been
no
instruction
as
to
the
presumption.
but
in
this
case
of
course
the
jury
was
instructed.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
it
may
have
been
that
he
has
directed
the
county
attorneys
to
discontinue
the
use
but
as
it's
always
the
case
and
circumstances
of
this
kind
--
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
it
doesn't
help
mine,
and
it
will
be
continued
to
be
used
until
each
one
of
them
is
ultimately
brought
in
line.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
no.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
yes.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
some
reverse
the
convictions
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
has
been
a
mix
of
cases
that
either
reverse
or
didn't
reverse.
the
cases
in
general
predate
this
court's
ruling
in
mullaney
and
in
many
cases
predate
this
court's
ruling
in
re
winship.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
i
think
both
the
ninth
circuit
cases
were
reversals.
mr.
byron
w.
boggs
on
that
ground.
and
i
think
that
may
be
also
true,
at
least
one
if
not
both
of
the
second
circuit
cases.
the
two
supervisory
opinions
as
it
were
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
did
not
reverse.
