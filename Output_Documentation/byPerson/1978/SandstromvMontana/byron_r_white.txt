justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
instruction
no.
5
hasn't
really
any
connection
with
that.
let's
assume
that
the
instruction
had
been
that
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
you
must
find
that
he
knowingly
caused
this
death.
instruction
no.
5
wouldn't
bother
you
on
that,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
just
in
connection
with
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
it
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
that
--
i
guess
you
can
say
that
there
was
a
general
verdict
here,
wasn't
there?
so
you
don't
know
whether
the
jury
found
purposely
or
knowingly?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
found
purposely
you
say
this
instruction
is
fatal
to
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
maybe
but
the
instruction
told
them
what
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
but
that
isn't
what
the
jury
was
told
and
you
know,
say
that
they
told
them
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
say
--
you
say
knowingly
and
purposely
then
are
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
may
be
but
certainly
the
instruction
has
defined
them
separately.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statutes
define
them
separately.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
you
ever
put
purpose
or
knowingly
then?
why
wouldn't
it
always
just
be
knowingly
if
you
always?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
do
--
and
that
they
do
define
them
separately?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
know
what
--
which
the
jury
found
in
this
case,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
know,
you
don't
know.
let's
assume
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
instruction
on
purpose
unconstitutional.
say
that
the
instruction
on
purpose
defining
it
or
somehow
was
unconstitutional.
then
you
have
a
problem
wouldn't
you
because
you
wouldn't
know
which
ground
the
jury
rested
on
whether
it's
purpose
or
knowing
because
it's
a
general
verdict.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
he
had
instructed
unknowingly
at
all
in
this
case
he
just
said
--
just
the
purpose
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
really?
you
mean
just
on
the
evidence
or
on
this
--
or
would
you
think
that
your
problem
--
the
problem
would
be
rooted
in
instruction
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
so
your
answer
is
yes,
instruction
5
would
give
you
real
trouble
if
all
the
judges
had
instructed
on
this
purpose?
