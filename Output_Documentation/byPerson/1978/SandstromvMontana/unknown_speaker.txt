mr.
boggs,
you
have
going
for
you
another
presumed
--
presumption
instruction,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
are
instructed
that
the
law
presumes
a
person
innocent
until
he's
proven
guilty.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that
approach
the
balance
of
the
one
of
which
you
complain?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
specifically
saw
instruction
no.
12?
unknown
speaker
right.
and
you
have
no
objection
to
that
instruction?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that's
insanity?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
in.
would
you
--
if
you
ever
found
purpose,
you
will
always
find
knowingly
too
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
--
let's
just
assume
that
if
there
has
been
an
instruction
on
purpose
alone
that
this
conviction
would
have
to
reverse
because
of
instruction
no.
5.
let's
just
assume
that.
there
wasn't
an
instruction
on
purpose
alone,
there's
an
instruction
on
the
purpose
or
knowledge
and
you
think
the
--
or
knowledge
would
save
the
case?
unknown
speaker
because
you
think
the
evidence
is
--
it's
so
likely
that
the
jury
went
on
that
ground?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
the
case
turns
on
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
the
rest
of
your
position.
your
opponent
has
conceded
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
if
this
instruction
had
said
“you
may
infer”
instead
“of
the
law
presumes”
it
would
have
been
alright.
are
you
arguing
that
in
effect
the
jury
may
have
still
understood
the
instruction?
unknown
speaker
that
they
could
not
--
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
capital
punishment?
unknown
speaker
yes,
we
do.
unknown
speaker
that
sense,
could
not
have
been
imposed.
