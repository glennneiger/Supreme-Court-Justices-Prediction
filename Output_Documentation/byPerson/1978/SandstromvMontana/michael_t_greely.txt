mr.
michael
t.
greely
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
certainly,
the
state
of
montana
is
not
unarmored
with
this
instruction.
and
since
the
beginnings
of
this
case
we
have
informed
the
prosecutors
of
state
of
montana
not
to
use
it.
that's
not
to
say
that
we
do
not
believe
the
instruction
as
used
in
this
particular
case
that
we
do
believe
the
instruction
used
in
this
particular
case
is
unconstitutional.
we
have
told
the
prosecutors
not
to
use
it
essentially
for
the
problems
that
are
for
reason
and
i
call
your
attention
to
the
main
instruction
and
i
believe
it's
the
kiontees
(ph)
case
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
had
a
lot
of
problem,
its
instruction
similar
to
this.
rather,
in
trying
to
draft
some
kind
of
instruction
that
would
meet
all
the
different
opinions
that
we
receive
from
all
the
different
circuits,
we
decided
to
inform
the
prosecutors
that
this
instruction
probably
wasn't
needed.
and
indeed
in
the
key
in
this
particular
case
our
position
is
essentially
that
the
instruction
was
superfluous.
now
in
montana,
there
are
essentially
three
elements
of
the
crime.
deliberate
homicide,
one
of
the
elements
is
that
it
has
to
be
a
voluntary
act,
and
another
element
is
that
the
defendant
had
to
have
caused
the
death
of
his
victim,
and
thirdly,
the
act
had
to
be
committed
either
purposely
or
knowingly.
now
that
is
in
the
alternative.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
absolutely
not.
purpose,
if
you
are
going
to
try
and
prove
purposely
you
will
have
to
prove
specific
intent
to
kill.
if
you're
going
to
prove
knowingly
you
can
prove
that
the
defendant
had
a
high
probability
that
the
acts
that
he
was
committing
would
create
in
this
case
death.
this
--
the
actual
stabbing
by
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
probably,
i
suspect
that
rather
than
always
--
if
you
will
find
purpose,
always
find
knowingly
i
think
probably
the
likelihood
of
ever
finding
a
purpose
isn't
too
great
unless
you
really
have
a
--
if
you
have
a
premeditated,
the
old
premeditated,
now
is
the
forethought
situation
you
probably
could
find
a
purpose.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i'm
not
certain
of
the
justification
for
it
that
our
criminal
code
was
adopted
largely
from
the
--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
they
are
defined
separately.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
no,
but
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
in
this
case
as
far
as
--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
obviously
you
would
always
have
that
problem
in
determining
what
the
jury
actually,
what
they
relied
upon.
but
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
court
could
look
at
the
facts
in
this
case
and
the
attempts
by
the
defendant
and
its
proof
would
indicate
that
the
jury
in
this
case
could
probably
--
more
likely
than
not
have
found
knowingly
as
opposed
the
purpose.
i
think
the
--
i
think
defendant
produced
evidence
to
indicate
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
didn't
do
it
on
purpose.
as
far
as
their
understanding
of
the
instruction
is
concerned.
i
think
that's
fairly
clear
when
you
read
the
confession
in
the
transcript
and
so
forth.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well
he
instructed
on
purpose
and
of
course
the
alternative,
the
way
the
law
has
defined
that
the
statute
itself
would
always
require
that
both
the
instructions
be
given
and
both
knowingly
and
on
purpose
would
be
used.
i
suspect
in
a
given
situation
that
the
judge
within
his
discretion
could
say
that
purpose
is
not
possible
--
(voice
overlap)
supposed
he
--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--
said
that
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
then
i
think
there
would
be
some
--
there
would
be
more
of
a
difficult,
more
difficult
in
holding
our
position
than
it
would
be
otherwise.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
jury
possibly
could
have
found
that
the
use
of
presumption
of
course,
we're
suggesting
to
the
court
--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
don't
know
if
they
can
be
separated
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
the
--
purposely
would
require
the
element
of
specific
intent
and
obviously
knowingly
does
not.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
deliberate
homicide,
committed
purposely
or
knowingly,
they
charge
this
case
of
course
always
describes
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
killed
the
victim
and
was
whatever
manner
he
did
it.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
don't
believe
that's
ever
happened,
your
honor.
i
obviously
don't
know
i've
never
it
was
in
my
experience
in
any
cases
that
have
brought
before
the
supreme
court
that
i
am
directly
familiar
with,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
instruction
ever
be
given
just
on
one
or
the
other.
it's
almost
--
it's
always
--
it
always
has
been
given
in
the
alternative
just
as
the
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that's
correct.
and
also
purposely
and
knowingly
also
is
required
as
a
part
of
mitigated
deliberate
homicide
even
though
the
instruction
in
this
case
was
given
to
the
jury
was
wrong.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
correct.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well
no,
i
think
the
case
turns
on
if
there
is
the
alternative
to
that
of
course
in
this
case
is
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
if
the
jury
have
taken
a
shortcut.
and
had
accepted
the
purpose
instruction
and
used
the
presumption
in
the
meaning
or
the
awareness
described
in
montana
law
that
they
would
raise
a
serious
constitutional
question
and
that's
the
primary
reason
why
we
have
suggested
the
prosecutor
is
not
to
use
it
anymore
because
it
could
happen
the
case
that
would
come
that
would
cause
that
problem.
but
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
that
the
presumption
as
it
was
given
in
this
case
had
a
similar
effect
to
the
inference
it
forms
that
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
fully
described
in
any
of
the
other
instructions.
now
usually
in
montana
you
will
find
that
this
presumption
is
given
that
other
instructions
are
given
that
would
qualify
it.
in
this
particular
case
i
didn't
have
it
for
whatever
reason,
so
there
was
no
qualifying
instruction
saying
that
the
defendant
had
to
be
--
that
the
--
if
it
were
an
inference
that
the
jury
could
or
could
not
find
that
presumption.
but
obviously
in
any
situation
when
you're
proving
an
intention,
you've
got
the
problem
of
an
inference
or
presumption
because
you
can't
really
prove
intent
by
direct
evidence.
basically,
the
state
is
aware
of
the
constitutional
questions
that
are
--
that
arise
here
and
essentially
as
we
understand
the
history
of
this
court
in
the
various
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
the
brief,
namely
the
series
of
cases,
gainey,
tot,
and
other
cases
which
relate
to
specific
intent
crimes.
the
problem
here
is
whether
or
not
the
burden
of
proof
has
shifted
to
the
defendant
and
that
the
defendant
is
in
a
position
of
having
to
prove
a
specific
element
or
disprove
a
specific
element
of
crime.
and
i
think
this
case
relates
in
that
respect
to
mullaney
but
in
the
mullaney
case,
the
aspect
of
malice
which
was
an
element
of
that
crime,
the
aspect
of
malice
was
presumed
and
the
defendant
was
in
the
position
of
having
to
disprove
that.
now
on
the
state
of
montana
mitigated
deliberate
homicide
has
the
same
elements
as
deliberate
homicide
except
that
it
can
be
mitigated
by
an
affirmative
defense
of
extreme
emotional
or
mental
distress.
the
presumption
in
this
case
and
i
used
the
term
“loosely”
because
we're
all
aware
that
presumption
and
inference
has
had
become
tremendously
confused.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
defense
counsel
that
the
legal
description
of
a
presumption
in
the
state
of
montana
applies
in
this
case
because
those
instructions
were
not
given
to
the
jury.
so
the
effect
in
the
presumption
--
of
the
term
a
person
is
presumed
to
intend
the
ordinary
consequences
of
his
act
has
some
other
meaning
in
this
case.
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
meaning
in
this
case
is
that
the
presumption
had
the
effect
of
an
inference,
an
inference
very
similar
to
that
of
barnes.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
think
that's
probably
true,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
effect
that
would
have
had
as
far
as
the
jury
is
looking
at
instruction
no.
5.
the
thrust
of
the
defendant's
case
apparently
was
in
essence
to
prove
that
he
could
not
have
proved
the
intent
kill
and
mistakenly
the
instruction
was
offered
to
suggest
that
if
the
jury
did
not
find
knowing
or
purpose
that
he
would
be
--
he
could
be
convicted
to
mitigate
deliberate
homicide.
now,
that's
an
incorrect
instruction.
however,
it
is
clear
i
believe
that
the
jury
had
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
knowing
and
purpose
instructions.
and
i
suspect
that
the
way
this
case
came
about
to
the
jury
believe
the
testimony
of
the
defendant's
witnesses
that
the
defendant
indeed
did
not
have
the
intent
to
kill.
and
therefore
they
were
forced
into,
if
they're
going
to
find
deliberate
homicide
they
were
forced
to
look
at
the
knowingly
provisions
and
the
definitions
that
he
should
have
understood
the
high
probability
of
the
consequences
of
stabbing
the
deceased.
and
i
think
that's
indeed
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
yes,
we're
arguing
that
they
could
have
--
that
the
instruction
itself
since
the
facts
of
the
case
indicated
that
the
jury
could
have
found
him
guilty
of
deliberate
homicide
based
on
the
knowingly
aspect
of
the
element
of
proof
that
the
jury
could
have
disregarded
the
instruction
or
if
they
had
looked
at
the
instruction
that
they
could
have
taken
the
position
that
it
wasn't
in
inference
like
that
in
barnes.
in
other
words
--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--
that
they
could
not
decide
that
because
he
stabbed
this
person
that
he
intended
to
kill
her.
then
i
believe
the
facts
of
the
case
indicate
the
jury
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
did
not
intend
to
kill
this
person.
i
think
that's
probably
what
they
came
to
do,
obviously,
it
appears
almost
more
likely
than
not
that
that's
what
happened.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
it
could
if
they
didn't
have
the
alternative
of
accepting
the
knowingly
aspect.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
think
that
the
reason
that
they
would
turn
it
to
us
because
the
facts
of
the
case
would
have
suggested
to
them
that
possibly
the
defendant
did
not
intend
to
kill.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
certainly
the
--
there
were
no
--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that's
true,
but
there
was
no
follow
up
instructions
to
explain
to
them
what
the
effect
of
a
presumption
was
and
whether
or
not
--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
think
that
if
they
had
treated
that
as
an
inference
that
would
certainly
make
it
(voice
overlap).
mr.
michael
t.
greely
true.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
true,
that's
true,
that
instruction
is
possible
it
could
be
interpreted
that
way.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
exactly.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
certainly,
there
is
the
--
certainly,
we
could
not
deny
that
there
is
no
risk
at
this
case
and
essentially
that
is
why
the
instruction
has
created
some
difficulties.
and
i
think
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
the
prosecution
could
prove
a
deliberate
homicide
beyond
reasonable
doubt
based
on
the
knowing
aspect
of
the
elements
of
proof.
and
possibly
even
by
an
inference
such
as
a
barnes
inference
could
have
prove
purpose
of
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
but
obviously
the
broader
position
to
stand
with
and
the
better
approach
to
take
as
far
as
what
the
jury
actually
did
was
that
they
found
that
the
defendant
did
this
knowingly.
and
even
that
they
may
have
found
that
they
accepted
the
defense
evidence
and
found
that
he
did
not
intend
to
kill
so
purposely
did
not
become
a
part
of
their
deliberation.
basically,
the
state
is
also
arguing
that
the
effect
of
the
instruction
no.
5
acting
as
an
inference
rather
than
a
presumption
that
if
there
was
any
shifting
that
was
taking
place
as
far
as
the
defendant
was
concerned
that
it
was
a
shifting
of
the
burden
of
production
and
not
the
shifting
of
a
burden
of
persuasion.
although
admittedly
montana
law
suggests
that
a
presumption
does
not
suggest
the
state
that
a
presumption
requires,
first
it's
to
overcome
that
presumption
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
this
case,
if
the
--
if
that
instruction
were
treated
as
an
inference,
the
effect
according
to
the
ruling
by
our
montana
supreme
court
in
this
case
would
be
that
the
defendant
would
be
required
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence.
just
as
in
the
barnes
case
when
the
inference
was
used
to
state
that
the
defendant
knew
that
recently
received
treasury
notes
were
stolen.
the
inference
in
that
case
was
that
the
mere
possession
of
those
recently
stolen
notes
would
create
the
presumption
or
inference
and
those
terms
i
use
interchangeably
although
i
think
most
scholars
understand
what
the
difference
between
those
are.
but
in
that
case,
essentially
you're
requiring
the
defendant
possibly
to
testify
in
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
but
that's
a
very
strong
inference
that
you're
require
him
to
take
upon
himself
to
come
forth
with
some
evidence
to
explain
his
possession
of
recently
stolen
property.
and
i
think
probably
that
inference
is
even
stronger
than
the
effect
this
presumption
may
have
had
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
more
subtle
because
there
were
not
any
qualifying
instructions.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
