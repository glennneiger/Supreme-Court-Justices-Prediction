hear
arguments
first
this

others
against
washington
state
commercial
passenger
fishing
vessel
association
and
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
attorney
general
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
they
had
a
right
to
--
was
it
a
different
right
from
the
right
of
the
indians?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you

chief

e.

mr.
lacovara.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
would
it
be
your
theory
mr.
lacovara
that
in
that
treaty
the
united
states
as
one
party
was
the
surrogate
for
all
other
than
indians?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
lacovara.
mr.
morisset.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
claiborne,
going
back
to
that
footnote,
suppose
there
was
no
footnote
in
the
opinion?
the
observation
you
read?
does
that
concept
reflect
anything
more
than
the
historical
fact
that
before
the
white
men
came
the
indians
had
exclusive
possession
unless
there
were
some
eskimos
or
some
other
people
around
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
had
exclusive
rights
until
others
came
along
and
began
to
compete
with
them,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
period
was
once
an
exclusive
right
whether
--
then
put
in
another
time
frame,
the
date
of
the
treaty,
that's
another
problem.
but
at
one
time
it
was
an
exclusive
right.

justice
warren
e.
burger

attorney
general

minutes

burger
mr.
attorney
general
you
read
and
i
take
it
you
were
reading
from
your
own
brief,
part
of
the
quote
from
the
1904
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
page
so
that
we
don't
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--

go
back
to
the
original.

burger

you
gentlemen.

case
is
submitted.
