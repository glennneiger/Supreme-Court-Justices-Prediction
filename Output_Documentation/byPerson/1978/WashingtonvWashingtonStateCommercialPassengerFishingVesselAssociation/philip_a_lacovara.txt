mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
--
the
attorney
general
has
emphasized
involves
the
question
whether
or
not
one
group
of
commercial
fishermen,
indians
in
this
case
is
entitled
to
a
court
awarded
perpetual
guarantee
of
a
competitive
preference
over
nine
indian
competitors.
the
attorney
general
has
indicated
that
that
result
is
wrong
and
we
strongly
support
that
aspect
of
the
state's
position.
since
my
time
this
morning
is
brief,
i
must
necessarily
rely
on
briefs
that
i've
submitted,
the
salmon
colored
opening
brief
and
the
yellow
reply
which
discuss
not
only
the
substantive
points,
the
historical
points,
questions
of
collateral
treaties
but
also
some
of
the
procedural
obstacles
that
the
united
states
and
the
tribes
have
attempted
to
erect
in
order
to
prevent
this
court
from
resolving
what
every
one
conceives
of
--
as
an
extremely
important
legally,
practically,
emotionally,
culturally,
politically
question
that
has
been
plaguing
the
northwest
and
will
continue
to
plague
the
northwest
unless
it
is
definitively
set
to
rest
by
this
court.
there
are
four
major
concepts
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
morning
and
they
all
grow
out
of
the
same
flaw
that
the
federal
courts
below
have
manifested
in
the
results
that
they
have
reached.
and
the
flaw
is
a
failure
to
recognize
and
fully
appreciate
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
non-indian
commercial
fisherman
also
have
rights
which
a
federal
court
of
equity
must
respect
here.
there
has
been
no
recognition,
no
appreciation
and
no
implementation
of
those
rights
of
the
non-indian
commercial
fishermen.
first
point
is
that
the
treaties
protect
to
the
non-indian
commercial
fishermen
a
right
of
access
to
this
fishery
as
well
as
a
protection
of
the
indian's
right
of
access
to
the
fishery.
this
was
to
be
a
nonexclusive
fishery
from
which
neither
indians
nor
non-indians
could
be
excluded
by
the
other
group.
secondly,
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
the
treaty
it
was
guaranteeing
the
rights,
the
continued
fishing
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
territory
now
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
washington
and
the
treaty
so
says
the
language
of
article
iii
of
the
treaties
secures
the
rights
of
indians
"in
common
with"
the
rights
of
the
citizens,
of
the
territory.
and
i
think
nothing
could
be
more
clear
from
the
text
of
the
treaties
as
well
as
from
the
history
of
the
negotiation
that
there
was
to
be
a
bilateral
commitment
that
treaty
indians
and
nontreaty
citizens
would
have
continuing
access
to
these
fisheries.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
gives
them
superior
rights
only
to
the
extent
that
the
court
in
winans
for
example
has
said,
the
state
cannot
legitimize
a
complete
exclusion
of
indians
from
the
fishery
through
the
medium
of
private
ownership
of
the
lands.
what
the
treaties
were
to
guarantee
to
the
indians
was
the
right
of
access
that
they
would
not
otherwise
have
had
in
1855.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
winan
so
held
that
it
should
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
which
citizens
would
not
have,
that's
right.
and
in
tu
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
tulee
for
example,
the
court
said,
"indians
under
the
treaty
are
also
immune
from
licensing
right",
regulations
also,
a
protection
that
citizens
would
not
have.
the
reason
for
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
i
think
the
point
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
the
indians
have
certain
protections
as
against
state
abrogation
or
interference
with
those
rights.
the
treaty
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
as
against
the
state.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
certainly
the
right
that
the
indians
obtained
under
the
treaty
can
be
qualified
by
federal
legislation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
question
though
is
whether
or
not
the
right
of
access
which
indians
are
to
be
given
is
one
that
can
be
turned
from
a
shield
if
you
will
against
state
interference
into
a
sword
which
allows
the
indians
to
keep
to
demand
that
the
state
keep
non-indians
from
fishing
side
by
side.
that
we
submit
is
exactly
what
these
treaties
were
not
intended
to
do
and
the
documents
that
bear
on
this
stand
only
a
few
page
in
the
records
and
everyone
demonstrates
that
the
indians
were
being
told
that
with
respect
to
off
reservation
fishing
they
could
not
interfere
with
the
settlers'
equal
opportunity
to
fish.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
and
that
is
one
of
the
linchpins
of
our
submission
that
what
judge
boldt
has
done
in
this
case
is
fundamentally
erroneous
because
as
the
orders
that
he
had
subsequently
entered
have
achieved.
the
indians
have
successfully
insisted
that
the
nontreaty
fisherman
stay
on
the
beach
and
watch
them
from
the
shore
while
the
indians
have
in
effect
a
court
decreed
oligopoly,
an
exclusive
preserve
in
trying
to
catch
this
fish
for
commercial
purposes.
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
treaties
where
the
history
of
their
negotiations
to
support
that
kind
of
exclusivity
of
the
fishery.
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
it
were
acting
for
conservation
purposes,
it
would
have
the
power.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i'm
not
sure
what
other
aspect
of
the
police
power
the
state
would
be
relying
on
just
willy-nilly
to
cancel
commercial
salmon
harvesting
unless
it
were
to
be
the
conservation
power.
one
of
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
but
if
the
state
has
the
power
to
eliminate
non-commercial
fishing
for
non-conservation
purposes,
the
court's
decisions
in
winans,
tulee
and
puyallup
indicate
that
the
state
cannot
do
that
for
indians.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
would
assume
that
the
state
would
have
that
power
even
as
respects
indians
but
that
extraordinary
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that
kind
of
extraordinary
development
i
think
would
give
rise
to
police
power
in
the
same
sense
that
the
court
held
that
there
was
an
implied
police
power
even
as
respects
indians
under
these
treaties.
the
second
point
is
that
when
conservation
becomes
necessary,
that
conservation
can
lawfully
be
imposed.
regulations
of
that
sort
can
lawfully
be
imposed
upon
the
treaty
indians
as
long
as
it's
done
without
discrimination
against
them.
but
by
the
same
token,
there
is
nothing
in
these
treaties
or
in
this
court's
earlier
cases
to
indicate
that
conservation
regulations
must
be
skewed
so
that
they
in
effect
discriminate
against
the
non-indians.
that
however
is
the
effect
of
the
preferential
rights
that
the
district
court
tolerated
on
one
theory
or
another
with
two
very
dubious
circuit
judges
this
last
time
around
has
--
have
in
effect
allowed.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
justice
stevens,
its
not
so
much
--
how
much
discrimination
but
what
type
that
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
yes.
there's
no
doubt
that
as
to
some
aspects
of
treaty
fishing.
there
are
special
benefits
that
were
secured.
what
we're
coming
to
though
is
whether
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
not.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
they
didn't
take
it
mr.
justice.
if
you
read
the
full
text
of
the
treaty
you
should
find
that
in
addition
to
these
guarantees
the
tribes
were
paid
what
in
contemporary
terms
would
be
considered
many
millions
of
dollars
to
extinguish
claims
of
occupancy.
and
they
were
guaranteed
and
were
provided
with
schools,
doctors,
blacksmiths,
carpenters
and
farmers
to
teach
them
other
trades
other
than
fishing.
so
we
--
i
think
it
would
not
be
accurate
to
view
these
treaties
in
1979
as
a
one
sided
adhesion
contract
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--
which
the
indians
had
no
choice
in
it.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
what
we're
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
what
we're
trying
to
do
mr.
justice
is
to
eliminate
the
discrimination
which
is
inherent
and
this
my
third
point
in
a
50/50
allocation.
the
district
courts
below
had
--
did
not
find
that
there
was
discrimination
against
indian
fishing
in
the
puyallup
sense.
the
only
reference
to
discrimination
in
judge
boldt's
findings
was
the
question
begging
assertion
that
there
was
discrimination
against
indians
because
the
state
conservation
regulations
did
not
actually
permit
them
to
catch
50%
of
the
harvest.
that's
the
issue
before
us
whether
or
not
the
indians
are
entitled
to
that.
our
submission
is
that
there
is
not
anything
of
that
sort
happening
here.
the
attorney
general
referred
for
example
to
the
phrase
of
river
run
of
salmon
for
which
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
any
kind
of
discrimination
because
the
indians
have
and
have
always
had
contemporaneous
access
to
those
runs
alongside
the
non-indian
fisherman.
so
it
is
impossible
to
talk
about
the
state
or
non-indian
fisherman
preempting
the
run
in
discriminating
against
indian
rights.
so
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
justice
i
think
the
key
inquiry
should
be
as
it
was
in
puyallup
ii
whether
or
not
the
rights
of
those
indians
or
the
successors
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
right
to
take
fish
at
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
not
necessarily
each
specific
ground.
and
the
findings
of
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
established
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
but
the
judge
also
found
that
a
treaty
times
there
were
ebbs
and
flows
of
runs
and
it
was
common
for
the
indians
to
follow
the
fish.
and
to
abandon
temporarily
if
necessary,
perhaps
permanently
a
usual
and
accustomed
site
and
go
elsewhere
if
that's
where
the
fish
were.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there
is
no
discrimination
against
indians.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
my
answer
would
be
there
is
no
treaty
violation
unless
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
to
the
extent
that
fish
were
there
and
there
was
no
guarantee
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
don't
think
it
does
mr.
justice
but
we're
a
long
way
from
that.
there
is
nothing
in
the
treaties
that
guaranteed
that
the
fish
would
continue
to
migrate
all
the
way
upstream.
i
think
we
could
go
as
far
as
saying
that
there
might
be
discrimination
in
the
conservation
system.
if
the
state
impose
the
structure
that
prevented
fish
from
reaching
any
of
the
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
of
treaty
tribes
but
i
don't
think
there's
anything
the
treaty
that
guarantees
that
a
run
of
some
size
or
other
must
reach
every
site
that
a
tribe
fished
at
in
1855.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
i
think
that's
implicit
in
the
50/50
allocation
because
this
system
itself
creates
the
prospect,
the
legal
entitlement
as
the
judge
has
ruled
it
to
have
the
makahs
take
50%
of
everything
coming
through
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
and
the
non-indians
take
the
other
half.
so
the
50/50
allocation
is
utterly
unresponsive
to
the
problems
here
and
if
anything
is
it
--
as
a
gratuitous
limitation.
it
has
a
superficial
appeal
but
it's
not
based
in
the
treaties
or
in
practice.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
the
absence
of
discrimination
i
would
say
no,
discrimination
in
the
puyallup
sense.
the
treaties,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
mr.
justice,
were
designed
to
secure
access
to
fishing
sites
without
a
guarantee
how
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
fishing
sites.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
but
as
every
fisherman
knows
and
as
the
indians
knew.
there
was
no
guarantee
that
there
would
be
fish
flowing
by
those
streams.
the
findings
say
that
because
the
floods
changes
in
the
course
of
tributaries,
many
of
the
sites
were
no
longer
productive
even
in
treaty
times.
so
it
should've
been
understood
that
at
particular
sites,
there
might
not
be
much
fishing.
but
that
is
--
with
all
due
respect,
a
very
artificial
assumption
here,
the
state
has
been
engaged
and
--
for
years
has
been
engaged
in
programs
to
plant
hatchery
fish
in
streams
that
would
otherwise
not
receive
an
adequate
flow
of
fish
because
of
the
commercial
harvesting
by
indians
and
non-indians
earlier
on
in
the
migratory
flow.
so
its
also
important
to
emphasize
that
the
district
court
hasn't
found
that
even
a
single
such
site
of
the
type
that
you're
describing
has
been
completely
preempted.
we
are
a
long
way
at
this
stage
of
this
case
from
a
finding
similar
to
the
one
in
puyallup.
my
final
point
was
going
to
be
mr.
justice
white
that
the
nontreaty
fishermen
are
entitled
to
their
own
day
in
court
and
if
there
are
no
procedural
obstacles
to
your
hearing
or
claims
on
the
merits
--
but
my
time
has
expired
and
i'll
have
to
rest
on
my
briefs.
