justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
we
thought
that
the
"and"
question
has
already
been
answered
and
it
wasn't
open
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you're
going
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
indicate
why
you
think
it's
open
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
referring
to
a
fishery
as
a
commercial
fishery?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
case
there
was
no
commercial
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
commercial
fishing
was
absolutely
free.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
gotten
around
to
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that
issue
open
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
indicate
--
you
would
say
that
the
state
might
be
able
to
cancel
all
commercial
fishing
for
salmon
for
several
years
but
not
indians.
justice
byron
r.
white
say
it
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
don't
meet
my
question,
assume
it
could,
it
couldn't
do
it
with
the
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
were,
the
district
court
certainly
violated
the
treaty.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
its
permitted
a
certain
group
of
fishermen
to
take
all
the
fish,
they
just
happen
to
be
indians
but
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
state
has
filed
to
prevent
the
exhaustion
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
permits
one
tribe
to
take
them
all,
take
all
the
indian
share,
isn't
it
--
just
as
much
trouble?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
the
treaty
isn't
it?
they
--
i
know
it
would
be
--
you'd
be
consistent
with
the
decree
but
how
about
under
the
treaty?
how
about
all
the
other
treaties?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
trouble
if
it
fails
to
provide
fish
--
the
indian
share
of
the
fish
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
--
not
in
any
trouble
if
it
deprives
all
but
one
tribe
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
can
be
preempted
by
one
tribe
without
the
state
being
in
trouble?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
state
has
obligated
than
i
gather
from
your
point
of
view
to
allot
--
to
make
sure
that
some
fish,
that
would
reach
indian
fishing
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
isn't
a
duty
not
to
--
if
the
reason
is
that
non-indian
fishermen
have
taken
it,
the
state
is
in
trouble.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
the
--
what
the
attorney
general's
reading
of
your
brief
that
nontreaty
indians
are
just
like
the
ordinary
--
like
the
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
would
this
be
too
much
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
non
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
there
some
nontreaty
indians
in
washington?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
have
any
fishing
--
they're
like
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
if
there
was
--
if
there
had
been
a
treaty
with
only
one
tribe
that
had
this
fishing
allocation
in
it,
judge
boldt
would
still
have
been
right
to
have
given
50%
to
that
one
tribe
and
none
to
the
other
tribes
would
have
any
fishing
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.--
excuse
me,
mr.--
the
solicitor
general,
the
accustomed
fishing
ground
for
these
tribes,
i
take
this
--
the
--
from
this
--
the
attorney
general's
statement
is
the
entire
puget
sound.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
state
doesn't
suggest
that
any
tribe
is
precluded
from
fishing
anywhere
in
puget
sound,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
treaty,
do
you
think
the
treaty
gives
any
particular
tribe
the
right
to
fish
anywhere
in
puget
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
they
protected
in
the
treaty
--
by
the
treaty
from
--
is
there
--
are
--
does
the
treaty
give
them
a
right
that
you
speak
of
to
take
fish
in
puget
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
a
--
i
suppose
then
you
could
think
of
a
tribe
that
if
it
were
found
fishing
in
the
straits.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
some
of
them
might
have
the
right
to
do
that
or
some
might
not
have
a
treaty
right
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
the
state
would
still
be
violating
the
treaty
if
said,
"the
only
place
we're
going
to
allow
fishing
is
out
here
in
this
particular
four-mile
square
area
of
puget
sound.
we're
going
to
allow
six
indians
and
six
white
commercial
fishermen.
we
call
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
can
--
that
each
of
them
can
take
as
many
as
they
want
as
long
as
they
leave
enough
for
conservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
into
your
agreement
under
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
your
--
let's
see,
with
the
counsel
that
the
state
would
be
in
no
travel
if
it
permitted
one
tribe
to
take
the
fish.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
only
thinking
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
it
was
the
district
court
who
overpromised?
