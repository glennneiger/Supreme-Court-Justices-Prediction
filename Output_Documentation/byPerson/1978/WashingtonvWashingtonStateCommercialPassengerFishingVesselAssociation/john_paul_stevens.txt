mr.
lacovara,
but
the
--
but
isn't
it
inevitable
if
there
is
some
discrimination
against
non-indians?
for
example,
the
indians
don't
have
to
get
licenses.
isn't
that
part
of
the
--
its
something
we
start
from
and
then
the
question
is
how
much
discrimination
or
whether
there's
any
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
agree
that
there
is
sort
of
a
given
that
we
start
with,
there
is
some
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
indians
by
virtue
of
the
treaty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
your
opponent
correct
though,
the
first
thing
we
have
to
decide
is
what
is
the
treaty
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
--
what
does
it
mean
"in
common
with"?
and
i'm
just
wondering
how
do
you
deal
with
the
argument
that
say
at
one
point
in
a
river
the
makahs
get
50%
and
the
non-indians
get
50%,
they
take
it
all.
what
happens
to
another
indian
tribe
upstream
or
downstream
that
wants
its
50%?
what's
the
answer
to
that
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
could
happen
under
the
district
court's
findings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
mr.
morisset,
putting
the
same
problem,
a
little
different
framework,
let's
put
ourselves
back
in
1854
and
55
and
say
there
are
three
or
four
tribes
on
the
same
river.
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
in
using
the
word
"common"
in
four
or
five
successive
treaties
affecting
the
same
run
of
the
fish
that
the
--
governor
stevens
intended
to
give
50%
of
that
run
to
four
or
five
different
groups
of
indians.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
situation
at
time
if
there
were
more
than
one
tribe
on
one
river
affected
by
two
successive
treaties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
claiborne
is
it
correct
that
it
would've
been
totally
valueless
that
--
there
wasn't
any
easement
problem,
i
missed
the
possible,
they're
usual
to
custom
banks
or
the
streams
could've
all
been
bought
up
by
private
owners
and
without
this
right,
they
wouldn't
have
had
access.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
could
be
quite
vital
could
it
not,
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
wondering
around
in
open
land.
justice
john
paul
stevens
from
the
water,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
treaty
itself
doesn't
spells
out
the
right
to
build
structures
and
so
forth,
so
it
does
seem
to
be
thinking
at
least
in
part
about
access.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
referring
to
the
"erecting
temporary
houses"
language
which
does
seem
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
to
be
thinking
in
terms
of
access.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
at
some
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
claiborne,
i
can't
get
to
it
at
your
--
i
don't
know
where
pits
in
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
did
not
rely
on
the
word
common
as
creating
the
50%
figure
but
rather
that
the
describe
the
--
ultimately
it
leads
to
an
allocation
of
50%.
--
how
do
we
get
it?
what
is
the
justification
for
50%
under
your
view
of
the
treaty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
remember
that
quote.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gorton,
may
i
ask
one
last
question,
under
your
version
of
the
treaty,
your
understanding
of
the
treaty,
assume
there
is
a
six
thousand
indians
and
six
hundred
thousand
white
people
who'd
want
to
fish
on
the
river.
is
it
your
view
that
they're
entitled
to
1000
for
the
fish?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
they
entitled
to
a
sort
of
(inaudible)
once
you
beat
this,
say
you
went
on
the
50%
point,
what
do
they
end
up
when
they
all
through
with
those?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
because
you've

the
number
of
non-indian
licenses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
took
off
the
limit
on
the
number
of
non-indian
licenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
any
other
percentage
