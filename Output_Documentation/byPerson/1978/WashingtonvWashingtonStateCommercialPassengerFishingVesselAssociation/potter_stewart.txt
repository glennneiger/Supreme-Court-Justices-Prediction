justice

stewart
is
the
--
those
aren't
the
only
words
of
article
3?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
also
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
right
of
taking
fish.
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
of
taking
fish.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
right
of
taking
fish.
justice
potter
stewart
the
district
court
in
its
original
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
original
affirmance
thought
that
the
phrase
"in
common
with
all
the
citizens
in
the
territory"
was
the
key
in
critical
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
phrase
but
it
may
not
be.
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
seasons,
the
season
limitations
on
them
and
catch
limits
on
indians?
justice
potter
stewart
general
gorton,
in
that
connection
in
article
--
article
ii
refers
to
said
indians,
what's
the
--
does
this
--
what
does
"said"
means?
justice
potter
stewart
the
indians
or
the
tribes
doing.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
reservations?
justice
potter
stewart
land
reservations?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
what
--
and
what
do
you
think
"said
indians"
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
what
in
1979
do
you
think
"said"
mean,
"said
indian"?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
because
those
people
are
all
dead.
justice
potter
stewart
present
tribal
members
or
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
descendants
of
the
people
who
were
tribal
members
in
1855.
there
is
a
difference.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
wondering
about
the
concession
that
you
quoted
to
us
on
the
part
of
the
tribes
that
you
said
that
indians
generally
didn't
have
any
treaty
rights
at
all
unless
they
were
present
tribal
members.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
present
members
of
treaty
tribes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
wondered
whence
that
concession?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
your
submission
is
not
the
rights
of
the
treaty
tribes
it
--
at
least
under
article
iii,
it's
the
rights
of
indians,
individual
indians,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
1979,
what
status,
the
direct
descendants
of
those
who
were
tribal
members
of
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
tribal
members.
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
the
members
of
the
treaty
tribes?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
his
great
grandfather
was
a
member
of
the
tribe
and
he
is
now
works
in
a
filling
station
in
seattle,
he
has
no
rights
under
the
treaty?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he's
not
now
a
member
of
the
tribe
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
he
resigned.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
those
cases
involved
a
--
or
at
least
puyallup
i
and
ii
involved
a
sport
fishing
for
steelhead
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
this
case
involves
primarily
at
least
commercial
fishing
for
salmon.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
freshwater
fishing
involved
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
indication
on
this
map
or
any
other
map
of
this
accustomed
--
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
going
upstream.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
pacific
salmon
deteriorate
in
quality
as
they
go
upstream,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
commercial
fishing
of
them
by
the
indians
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
freshwater?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
their
right
to
fish,
that
those
accustomed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
grounds
and
stations
must
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
very
ephemeral,
so
there
are
no
fish
there,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
"right
to
fish"
mean?
i
know
when
i
go
fishing,
nobody
gives
me
their
own
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
a
fish
wheel?
i've
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
just
take
your
time.
justice
potter
stewart
some
sort
of
a
trap?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
is
open
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata
but
the
government
doesn't
rely
on
the
--
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
rely
on
res
judicata
but
rather
on
more
prudential.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
among
other
things.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
the
son.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
think
--
is
it
your
submission
mr.
lacovara
that
article
iii
doesn't
give
to
indians
any
superior
or
special
rights
whatsoever?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
private
property
to
get
to
these
places,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
citizens
would
not
have.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
concede
that
indians
are
given
superior
and
different
in
other
--
in
rights
than
citizens
by
article
iii,
don't
you
or
you
just
have?
justice
potter
stewart
which
citizens
don't
have.
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
do
have
--
indians
do
have
superior
rights
and
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
the
very
least
article
iii
makes
clear
that
the
rights
secured
or
reserved
to
the
indians
is
not
an
exclusive
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
lacovara,
let's
consider
for
a
moment
this
upstream
accustomed
places
and
stations,
in
article
iii
it
gives
the
indians
the
right
of
taking
fish
there.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
concede
that
if
the
state
of
washington
or
any
other
government
should
threw
its
licensing
and
supervision
of
fishing
adopts
such
rules,
regulations
that
would
be
--
assure
that
there
were
no
fish
there
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
treaty?
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
to
take
fish?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
(voice
overlap)
specific
grounds,
you'd
come
to
all
of
them
and
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
quite
answer
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about
if
there's
a
treaty
violation
if
the
state
of
washington
so
operates
it
conservation
rules
and
regulations
as
to
guarantee
that
there
are
no
fish
at
this
upstream
station
and
grounds.
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
is
a
right
of
taking
fish
there,
guaranteed
to
the
indians
by
article
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
doesn't
that
imply
some
kind
of
duty
to
allocate
or
to
see
to
it
that
there
are
some
fish
there?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
there
--
can
be
implied
from
the
rights
given
to
the
indians
by
article
iii
of
the
--
these
treaties,
any
duty
whatsoever
of
any
allocation
whatsoever
of
fish
to
the
indians.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
access
to
fishing
sites,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
just
a
bath
where
you
can
fish
all
day
and
not
catch
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
and
doesn't
another
indian
tribe
have
a
legitimate
complaint
in
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
under
the
treaty
if
the
district
judge
is
correct,
not
just
a
right
against
the
other
tribes,
they
have
a
right
against
the
united
states,
the
other
signatory
to
the
treaty.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
my
brother
stevens
suggest
that
it
test
the
validity
of
district
judge's
construction
of
the
treaty?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
the
state
concedes
that
it
has
a
duty
to
provide
what
it
calls
an
equal
opportunity
of
fishery
and
if
in
fact
these
present
law
don't,
i
think
it
concedes
that
they
should
be
modified
because
of
that
duty.
that's
--
that
was
my
understanding
of
its
submission.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
certain
the
indians
wouldn't
know
anything
about
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
i
want
to
agree
with
you,
didn't
then
judge
boldt
err
in
his
first
decision
by
thinking
almost
that
he
had
no
discretion
that
it
--
that
"in
common
with"
meant
50%?
justice
potter
stewart
that
"in
common
with"
(voice
overlap)
50%
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
it
said,
"well,
(inaudible)
"in
common"
and
that
means
50%.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
--
you
of
course
say
that
article
iii
was
a
reservation?
justice
potter
stewart
although
by
its
terms
it's
unlike
article
ii
for
example,
it
certainly
is
not,
is
it?
its
--
doesn't
say
its
hereby
reserved
as
--
as
hereby
secured
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
could
lead
to
the
argument
that
it
wasn't
a
reservation
that
there
was
a
conveyance
of
it
and
then
an
agreement
that
nonetheless
these
rights
would
be
secured.
justice
potter
stewart
because
they
were
--
by
its
terms
a
reservation.
article
iii
is
not
by
its
terms
a
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
most
of
them
do,
if
not
all.
justice
potter
stewart
is
conceded
which
way?
justice
potter
stewart
what?
justice
potter
stewart
it
may
have
or
it
may
not,
both,
it
can't
require
licenses,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
certain
things
it
may
not
apply,
certain
of
it's
--
if
its
conservation
laws,
it
may
not
apply
to
the
indians,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event
its
all
conceited
one
way
or
the
other,
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
at
least
a
right
of
access;
winans
holds
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
are
no
alternatives,
it's
this
or
that
cause
it
clearly
and
concededly
is
a
right
of
access,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
sort
of
construe
that
as
the
--
as
a
guarantee
of
the
right
of
catching
fish
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
just
to
the
right
of
fishing?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
i
must
say
i
would
have
--
that's
alright,
i
would've
greatly
enjoyed
it
many
times.
i
don't
know
of
any
indian.
justice
potter
stewart
a
right
to
take
fish
though.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
in
winans?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
suppose
justice
mckenna
meant
on
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
winans,
in
that
one
sentence
to
which
our
attentions
had
been
called,
kind
of
almost
biblical
language
and
that
there
may
be
an
adjustment
and
accommodation
of
them,
with
them
as
the
--
relative
rights
and
obligations
under
the
treaties.
the
solicitor
general
concedes
and
points
out
the
way.
have
you
looked
at
the
(inaudible)
brief
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what
he
say
--
you
say
he
was
not
doing
that.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
he
doing?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
(voice
overlap)
has
to
be
in
something.
you're
telling
us
what
it
doesn't
mean.so
what
does
it
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
(voice
overlap)
by
negotiation
and
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
you
would
have
the
right
to
negotiate
and
agree
with
that
and
maybe
you
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
do
it
unilaterally.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
claiborne's
concluding
point
was
as
i
understood
him
that
the
winan's
right
of
indian
access
to
this
usual
and
accustomed
spots
is
one
part
of
the
article
iii
guarantee
and
another
part
of
it
is
that
there
will
be
fish
there
when
the
indians
get
there,
sort
of
the
--
their
freedom
with
the
fish
--
to
have
some
fish
to
get
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
that
must
imply
some
duty
of
allocation.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
when
you
say
you
cannot
make
it
an
empty
right,
that
does
imply
a
duty
at
some
point
to
assure
the
presence
of
fish.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
in
thier
allocation
or
otherwise.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
told
us
who
skipped
it?
