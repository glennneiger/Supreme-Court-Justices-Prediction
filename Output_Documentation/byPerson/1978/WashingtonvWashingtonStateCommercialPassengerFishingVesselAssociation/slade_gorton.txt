mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
claiborne
has
just
delivered
to
the
clerk
a
large
map
or
sets
of
maps
of
the
case
area
which
may
aid
in
your
understanding
of
this
argument
into
which
we
have
no
objections.
the
central
issue
in
this
litigation
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
clerk
has
them
mr.
justice
brennan
and
would
not
--
mr.
claiborne
just
delivered
them
to
him
and
he
didn't
wish
to
put
them
on
your
desks
until
you
stated
the
desire
to
have
them.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
central
issue
in
this
litigation,
the
issue
to
which
every
other
question
is
subsidiary
is
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
and
i
quote,
"and
common
with
all
citizens"
found
in
each
of
the
treaties
with
which
we
are
concerned.
very
little
of
the
record
and
only
a
few
paragraphs
of
the
original
district
court
decision
are
relevant
to
the
central
issue.
the
answer
to
the
subsidiary
questions
is
relatively
easy
once
this
court
construes
the
"and
common
with"
language.
without
a
decision
on
that
point,
answering
the
other
questions
is
unlikely
to
resolve
the
controversy.
the
united
states
and
the
tribes
seek
to
fragment
the
controversy
and
delay
its
ultimate
resolution.
mr.
slade
gorton
if
you
felt
that
the
question
had
already
been
answered
that
or
that
it
were
final
in
some
respect
or
another
we
would
not
be
able
to
bring
it
here
in
this
litigation.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
united
states
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
the
united
states
says
it
may
come
up
here
in
connection
with
some
other
case
later.
the
crux
of
our
position
is
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
they
are
not
and
i
will
deal
with
the
usual
and
accustomed
--
mr.
slade
gorton
(voice
overlap)
as
well.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes
that
the
entire
phrase
speaks
of
the
fish
and
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
right
of
taking
fish
usual
and
accustomed
stations
and
"in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory".
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
crux
of
our
position
here
again
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
the
district
court's
decision
mandating
a
50%
allocation
of
anadromous
fish
to
treaty
indians
is
without
support
either
in
that
treaty
language
or
in
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
execution
of
the
treaties.
our
view
is
that
the
treaty
language
secured
before
the
indians,
the
right
to
participate
in
a
common
fishery
from
which
they
might
otherwise
have
been
excluded.
in
other
words,
the
treaties
guaranteed
in
perpetuity
an
equal
opportunity
fishery.
but
before
discussing
that
discussion
of
the
treaties,
let's
reflect
for
a
moment
on
the
actual
impact
of
an
equal
opportunity
fishery
on
indians
should
that
be
your
holding.
would
such
a
holding
deprive
treaty
indian
fisherman
of
a
reasonable
participation
in
the
fishery,
not
at
all.
the
contrary
in
an
equal
opportunity
fishery,
indian
participation
will
continue
to
be
substantial
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
share
of
the
population
of
the
puget
sound
region.
in
fact
the
percentage
of
all
commercial
fishermen
who
are
indians
is
likely
to
continue
to
increase
and
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
the
state
began
to
limit
the
number
of
licenses
to
engage
in
commercial
salmon
fishing
five
years
ago.
that
program
has
resulted
in
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
non-indian
commercial
fishing
licenses.
indians
on
the
other
hand
are
not
required
to
obtain
state
licenses.
indians
--
in
addition
to
that
are
not
required
to
pay
for
those
licenses.
mr.
slade
gorton
thus
the
major
limitation
--
excuse
me.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
the
--
that's
the
crux
of
the
case
as
to
whether
or
not
that
type
of
regulation
can
be
imposed
to
non-indians
equally
with
others.
it's
clear
that
they
do
not
require
licenses.
so
the
major
limitation
on
the
number
of
treaty
indian
fisherman
at
this
point
leaving
aside
their
catch
is
their
own
interest
in
the
business.
second,
indians
are
not
subject
to
the
financial
burdens
of
either
state
license
fees
or
landing
taxes.
they
are
nevertheless
the
beneficiaries
of
the
hatchery
programs
which
are
financed
by
those
taxes.
third,
the
indian
capability
to
fish
competitively
has
been
increased
greatly
by
federal
and
tribal
financial
assistance
in
the
purchase
of
sophisticated
boats
and
gear.
at
the
same
time
the
state
has
been
buying
up
and
retiring
non-indian
boats
and
licenses.
the
state
has
also
assisted
indian
hatchery
operations
and
fish
farming
enterprises.
fourth,
and
we
get
to
the
treaty
at
this
point.
the
district
court
has
determined
the
and
i
quote
from
the
treaty,
"usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations"
of
the
indians
are
not
restricted
to
small
areas
near
the
reservations.
for
one
tribe
or
another,
those
grounds
include
of
puget
sound
which
you
have
there
on
that
map.
all
of
the
united
states
portion
of
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
and
that
state's
portion
of
the
pacific
ocean,
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
the
coast.
in
summary,
they
include
all
of
the
states
marine
waters
in
the
case
area
together
with
portions
of
the
pacific
ocean
beyond
to
the
state's
jurisdiction.
every
mile
of
water
shown
on
that
map
in
the
united
states
is
a
part
of
the
usual
in
the
custom
grounds
of
some
indian
tribe
under
the
district
court's
decision.
and
we
do
not
object
to
that
characterization.
the
district
court
is
its
rationale
for
the
50%
plus
allocation
extracted
a
part
of
an
1855
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
common.
that
rationale
has
long
since
been
abandoned.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
respondents
have
continued
the
search
on
successfully
for
a
rational
on
which
they
could
and
will
support
that
rigid
allocation.
most
of
their
substitutes
in
the
original
decision
itself
rest
on
the
characterization
of
the
fishing
right
as
tribal
rather
than
as
individual.but
all
references
to
treaty
fishing
rights,
in
every
treaty
save
one.
secure
those
rights
specifically
to
individuals
while
the
other
articles
of
the
treaties
refer
to
and
to
deal
with
the
tribes
necessities.
governor
stevens
of
course
included
the
"in
common
with"
language,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
"all
of
the
fishery
language
in
treaty
drafts
which
he
presented
to
the
tribes.
he
explained
the
provision
as
expressing
his
view
and
we
quote
from
some
of
the
treaty
minutes.
he
wanted
them
to
fish
but
that
the
white
should
fish
also."
that
treaty
language
does
explain,
he
is
apparently
the
source
of
the
equal
protection
guarantees
for
individuals
found
to
be
implicit
in
the
treaties
by
this
court
and
puyallup
i
and
puyallup
ii.
the
treaties
do
of
course
secure
certain
rights
to
the
indians
not
possessed
by
other
citizens.
they
are
contained
largely
in
that
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations
clause.
mr.
simmons,
an
indian
agent
present
at
the
negotiations
explained
to
the
indians
that
and
again
i
quote
the
minutes,
"the
privilege
was
giving
--
was
given
of
going
wherever
they
pleased
to
fish."
and
this
court
in
its
first
decision
on
the
treaties,
winans
in
1905
distinguished
clearly
between
the
right
to
fish
which
the
court
characterize
and
i
quote
as
a
mere
right
not
exclusive
in
which
citizens
might
share
from
what
this
court
called
the
"special
means
for
its
exercise,
the
special
right
is
the
right
of
access".
the
state
could
regulate
the
right
to
fish
under
circumstances
which
you've
set
down
but
it
may
not
exercise
the
right
of
access.
excuse
me,
regulate
the
right
of
access.
the
fallacy
of
the
50%
plus
allocation
is
perhaps
most
graphically
illustrated
by
its
own
logical
result.
there
were
five
treaties
affecting
the
puget
sound
fishery,
not
one.
there
were
scores
of
quasi
sovereign
indian
bans
on
puget
sound
whom
governor
stevens
consolidated
for
treaty
purposes.
but
if
the
treaties
mandate
a
50%
plus
allocation
at
all,
the
single
treaty
with
the
makahs,
the
tribe
located
where
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
meets
the
pacific
ocean
would
guarantee
that
tribe
of
50%
plus
allocation
of
the
fish
passing
through
their
grounds.
next,
the
grounds
of
the
tribes
who
would
sign
to
the
treaty
of
point
no
point,
that
the
point
where
puget
sound
meets
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
span
the
entrance
to
lower
puget
sound
totally.
they
would
thus
be
best
be
authorize
to
take
50%
of
all
of
the
salmon
which
could
escape
the
makahs
cutting
in
half
all
runs
destined
further
grounds
of
the
indian
beneficiaries
of
three
more
treaties
farther
south
on
the
sound.
by
the
time
the
few
remaining
fish
reach
the
last
in
line,
the
yakamas,
theirs
is
an
entitlement
to
50%
of
almost
nothing.
and
if
non-indians
take
their
50%
at
point
no
point,
the
lower
sound
tribes
would
have
literally
nothing.
after
all,
if
the
indians
are
entitled
to
have
a
50%
return
of
fish
to
their
normal
and
accustomed
grounds,
the
articles
in
the
treaty
which
give
them
exclusive
fishing
rights
on
their
reservations
must
guarantee
a
100%
return
of
fish
to
those
reservations
and
thus
leave
nothing
for
anyone
else.
clearly
the
treaties
don't
mandate
a
50%
plus
allocation.
but
what
do
the
treaties
mean
in
that
case.
their
language
implies
an
equal
opportunity
of
fishery
by
the
"in
common
with"
language
with
special
indian
rights
of
access.
so
did
governor
stevens'
explanation
to
the
indians.
so
does
your
finding
of
implications
of
equal
protection
in
the
puyallup
series.
but
there
is
more.
let's
look
at
the
jurisdictional
status
of
puget
sound
in
the
years
surrounding
1850
before
the
treaties
were
signed.
united
states'
sovereignty
over
what
is
now
washington
state
was
perfected
by
an
1846
treaty
with
great
britain.
that
sovereignty
brought
with
it
the
common
law
and
the
statutes
of
the
united
states.
that
common
law
in
turn
included
the
concept
of
a
common
fishery
for
the
benefit
of
all
except
as
expressly
limited
by
statute
so
american
citizens
had
the
right
to
fish
in
puget
sound
before
the
execution
of
the
indian
treaties.
the
record
reveals
that
they
did
fish
in
puget
sound
then.
the
treaties
didn't
create
that
right.
mr.
slade
gorton
no.
it
was
the
same
right.
at
that
point
everyone
shared
a
common
fishery.
what
the
indians
--
what
the
treaties
secured
for
the
indians
was
the
continuation
of
that
right
free
from
interference
by
the
territorial
legislature
which
might
very
well
have
passed
a
law
saying
that
common
fishery
is
for
citizens
only.
without
the
treaties,
and
without
citizenship,
the
indians
could've
been
excluded
from
that
fishery
by
the
territorial
legislature
or
by
private
action.
and
the
tribes
admit
as
much
themselves
on
page
248
of
their
brief,
they
state
the
obvious
and
i
quote
from
that
brief."
indian
fishermen
who
are
not
members
of
treaty
tribes
enjoy
no
special
rights.
their
fishing
is
subject
to
the
same
limitation
placed
on
all
non-indian
fishermen."
now
why
the
nontreaty
indians
enjoy
no
special
rights?
if
indians
brought
exclusive
fishing
rights
to
the
treaty
negotiations
and
merely
relinquished
a
portion
of
those
rights,
nontreaty
indians
would
still
have
exclusive
rights
with
their
usual
and
accustomed
places
today.
but
this
court
has
already
affirmed
the
decision
which
is
consistent
with
that
concession
by
the
tribe
--
in
the
tribal
brief.
in
u.s.--
mr.
slade
gorton
"said"
refers
to
indians
who
are
members
of
the
tribes
which
signed
that
particular
treaty.
you'll
note
the
structure
of
the
treaty
in
the
articles
and
in
the
different
verbs
which
are
--
the
different
phrases
which
are
used.
in
the
beginning
of
the
treaty,
the
indians
grant
their
claims
to
lands
to
the
united
states.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
tribes
and
they
spoken
of
these
tribes.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
reserved
to
the
tribes
out
of
those
grants
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
lands
as
reservations.
mr.
slade
gorton
but
what
about
fisheries?
there
is
secured
to
said
indians
the
right
to
fish
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
stations
"in
common
with"
citizens
of
the
territory.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
means
the
indians
as
individuals
who
were
members
of
the
tribes
which
signed
the
treaty
just
as
citizens
referred
to
citizens
who
were
part
of
the
corporate
body
of
the
united
states
itself.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
state
has
not
taken
an
explicit
position
on
that
treaty.
i
think
it
relates
to
whether
or
not
you
can
order
the
state
department
of
fisheries
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
treaty
or
whether
or
not
that
depends
on
state
legislative
authorization
since
we
feel
and
that
we'll
say
that
the
state
courts
would
acknowledge
that
state
legislation
now
gives
to
the
department
of
fisheries
the
right
to
manage
the
fishery
consistently
with
the
treaties
it
(voice
overlap).
mr.
slade
gorton
there
--
i
was
directing
it
however
at
the
right
of
the
state
agency
to
enforce
those
treaty
obligations
as
you
may
interpret
them.
from
the
point
of
view
of
securing
or
guaranteeing
the
rights
outlined
in
the
treaty,
we
would
agree
that
the
treaties
are
self-executing.
they
did
not
require
a
legislation
by
congress.
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly
what
it
meant
in
1854.
mr.
slade
gorton
oh,
the
successors,
their
descendants.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
complexity
of
who
is
a
tribal
member
is
turgid
and
perhaps
too
difficult
for
me
to
go
into
because
the
indian
tribes
by
and
large
set
their
own
membership
and
the
people
are
often
granted
membership
in
various
tribes
who
have
an
extremely
tenuous
blood
relationship
with
the
indians
who
signed
the
original
treaty.
mr.
slade
gorton
not
--
unless
they
were
present
tribal
members,
unless
they
were
members
of
treaty
tribes.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
correct.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
concession
simply
recognizes
the
fact
that
the
special
rights
of
treaty
tribes
stemmed
from
the
treaty
and
not
some
--
not
from
something
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
preceding
your
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes
but
by
reason
of
their
status,
by
reason
of
their
membership
in
certain
tribes.
mr.
slade
gorton
members
of
the
tribe.
mr.
slade
gorton
members
of
the
tribes.
i
suppose
--
mr.
slade
gorton
present
members
of
the
treaty
tribes.
there
might
conceivably
someday
be
a
contest
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
indian
was
properly
a
member
of
a
tribe
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
but
that
contest
has
not
yet
taken
place.
mr.
slade
gorton
oh,
yes
he
does.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes
he
is.
mr.
slade
gorton
then
he
would
lose
those
rights.
there's
not
much
reason
for
him
to
resign.
but
only
if
he
took
him
--
affirmatively
self
--
took
himself
out
of
the
tribe
would
he
find
himself
in
that
status.
many
of
these
treaty
indians
do
live
off
the
reservation
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
and
in
cities,
perhaps
the
majority
of
them.
i
don't
use
this
line
of
reason
--
excuse
me,
the
court
recognized
this
distinction
between
the
treaty
and
nontreaty
indians
in
u.s.v.
mcgowan
in
a
long
opinion
in
2
f.
supp.
426
in
1932
which
was
simply
affirmed
by
this
court
without
opinion
in
294
u.s.592.
now,
i
don't
use
this
line
of
reasoning
of
the
status
of
the
non-indian
in
1850
as
conclusive
proof
of
our
construction
of
the
"in
common
with"
language
in
the
treaties.
the
language
itself,
governor
stevens'
explanation
of
it
in
your
puyallup
positions
it
seems
to
me
lead
to
that
conclusion.
but
that
line
of
reasoning
based
on
concepts
of
sovereignty
and
what
actually
was
the
situation
in
the
mid-19th
century
argues
very
powerfully
that
the
united
states
whose
citizens
possessed
the
right
to
a
common
fishery
in
1850.
and
which
planned
for
vast
increases
in
the
non-indian
population
by
the
very
treaty
negotiations
themselves
did
not
casually
treat
away
in
perpetuity
more
than
half
of
the
fishery
resource.
now
would
come
the
logical
question.
even
if
the
50%
plus
allocation
is
not
required
by
the
treaties.
isn't
the
lesson
of
your
three
puyallup
positions
that
some
specific
allocation
is
required?
our
answer
to
that
is
no.
and
the
distinctions
between
this
case
and
puyallup
are
vital.
the
puyallup
cases
dealt
with
a
discriminatory
fishery.
that
is
one
which
you
characterized
as
totally
preempted
by
non-indians
to
justify
such
a
disseminary
fishery
that
could
be
none
at
all.
the
state
at
least
had
to
prove
that
its
system
was
absolutely
necessary
for
conservation.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
the
--
well,
the
entire
fishery
was
preempted
by
non-indians
by
your
decision
--
mr.
slade
gorton
commercial
fishing
was
absolutely
barred.
no
one
could
engage
in
a
commercial
fishery.
since
we
could
not
prove
that
that
regulatory
system
was
absolutely
necessary
for
conservation,
it
fell.
after
puyallup
ii
however,
it
seems
that
the
state
had
two
possible
courses
of
action,
not
one,
either
an
equal
opportunity
net
fishery,
commercial
fishery
for
everyone
or
an
allocation
between
treaty
net
fishermen
and
nontreaty
sport
fisherman.
the
state
chose
the
latter
and
you
approved
it
in
puyallup
iii
and
permitted
the
states
to
even
to
regulate
an
on-reservation
fishery
to
see
that
the
non-indians
got
their
allocation.
but
the
marine
water
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
for
salmon.
that's
exactly
right.
and
there
is
in
addition
a
major
distinction
between
those
two.
steelhead
can
only
be
caught
in
freshwater.
by
the
time
fish
get
to
freshwater,
conservation
policies
are
very
simple.
the
only
conceivable
conservation
policy
is
one
which
will
get
enough
fish
upstream
to
spawn.
when
one's
dealing
with
the
marine
salmon
fishery
however
conservation
has
necessarily
got
to
be
a
much
broader
concept.
if
you
look
at
the
map
on
page
348
in
the
joint
appendix
which
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs
of
the
tribes,
you
will
note
major
areas
in
puget
sound
denominated
salmon
preserves.
the
tribes
characterize
those
as
areas
which
are
permanently
close
to
commercial
fishing.
that
is
an
error
as
far
as
the
south
sound
preserves
their
concern
that
there
are
frequent
commercial
fisheries
there.
it's
a
perfect
to
characterization
along
the
shores
of
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
and
what
called
areas
one
and
two.
no
commercial
fishing
for
salmon
is
permitted
there
but
a
sport
fishery
is.
that
bring
those
areas
precisely
into
your
puyallup
ii
situation
since
they
are
"usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations".
we
simply
cannot
ban
entirely
a
commercial
fishery
there
and
the
district
court
has
permitted
indian
fisheries
there.
but
the
state
can
permit
non-indian
fisheries
there.
if
conservation
is
the
only
way
that
we
can
control
the
fishery
and
if
conservation
is
only
letting
enough
fish
to
escape
to
spawn
inevitably
the
whole
commercial
fishery
is
going
to
get
driven
out
there
so
that
both
sides
can
get
their
share
because
it
can't
be
closed
down
as
to
non-indians
until
you've
gotten
down
to
just
the
number
of
fish
necessary
for
escapement.
so
conservation
in
a
marine
area
in
the
commercial
field
has
got
to
include
something
else
than
pure
escapement
for
spawning.
it's
got
to
include
a
concept
of
optimum
yield
and
of
a
fair
distribution
of
the
fishery
among
all
types
of
fishermen,
indians
or
non-indians,
(inaudible),
gillnetters
and
the
like.
every
one
of
your
cases
in
which
you've
used
the
word
conservation.
six
straight
cases
from
winans
to
puyallup
iii
have
all
dealt
with
freshwater
fisheries.
this
is
the
first
time
we
are
dealing
with
a
marine
salt
water
fishery.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
this
"usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations"
go
up
the
streams
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
to
their
very
sources.
mr.
slade
gorton
but
the
principle
focus
of
the
case
is
on
the
salt
water
marine
fishery.
now,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
slade
gorton
they're
everything.
mr.
slade
gorton
for
one
--
mr.
slade
gorton
oh,
well,
that's
right.
that
--
these
maps
do
not
show
the
upstream,
the
freshwater
usual
and
accustomed
grounds,
they
do
show
because
all
of
the
salt
water
are
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
of
one
tribe
or
another,
that's
all
of
that.
mr.
slade
gorton
most
of
them
do,
yes.
by
the
time
they've
got
to
the
spawning
beds,
they
are
much
less
valuable
than
they
are
further
downstream
and
--
mr.
slade
gorton
by
the
indians,
not
by
non-inidians.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
they
have
a
right
to
fish
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
if
those
usual
and
accustomed
places
--
mr.
slade
gorton
which
is
--
pardon?
which
would
be
ephemerable
if
no
fish
were
there,
that's
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
exactly
correct.
and
the
logical
res
--
there
were
logical,
answer
to
that
is,
if
the
indians
have
a
usual
and
accustomed
right
to
fish,
where
they
historically
fished,
at
the
very
top
of
the
stream,
there
must
be
an
allocation.
it
is
clearly
--
it's
clearly
required.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
however
not
only
terrible
management
policy
but
has
also
been
abandoned
by
this
court
as
long
ago
as
winans
and
even
by
the
way
the
united
states
manages
its
marine
fishery
for
this
reason.
one
of
those
upstream
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations
may
well
have
only
a
single
one
with
a
few
hundred
fish
coming
back
to
it.
but
in
marine
waters,
that
run
is
mixed
with
many
other
runs
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
fish.
if
the
state
has
got
to
return
those
salmon,
plan
to
return
that
single
run
of
salmon
to
that
single
upstream
usual
and
accustomed
ground
and
place,
there
will
be
a
tremendous
wastage
of
fish
in
all
of
the
other
--
in
all
of
the
marine
water
areas.
consequently
the
district
court
itself
has
found
marine
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations
for
almost
all
the
treaty
indians.
each
of
the
--
one
of
the
treaty
groups
have
tried,
point
no
point
has
now
petitioned
that
the
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
of
each
of
those
tribes
are
the
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
of
all
of
them.
we
don't
object
to
that.
that's
good
fishery
management.
in
winans,
you
dealt
with
an
exclusive
right
of
access
but
also
there
is
a
cryptic
note
in
that
decision.
there
was
a
fish
wheel,
non-indian
fish
wheel
at
usual
station
--
and
accustomed
station
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
slade
gorton
fish
wheels
are
--
well,
a
--
mr.
slade
gorton
a
method
of
taking
fish
which
is
now
outlawed
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
because
it
catches
--
yes.
it
catches
every
fish
that
goes
through.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
was
on
privately
owned
land
on
an
indian
station.
so
in
dealing
with
the
right
to
fish
as
opposed
to
the
right
to
access,
this
court
says
in
winans,
the
solicitor
general
points
the
way.
we
quote
at
pages
85
and
86
of
our
opening
brief,
the
way
which
the
solicitor
general
pointed.
he
said
the
indians
could
be
given
more
advantageous
places
or
advantageous
places
upstream
or
downstream
from
that
fish
wheel.
this
is
what
the
united
states
does,
it
manages
its
ocean
fishery
primarily
for
non-indians.
and
then
says
that
the
state
must
cut-down
non-indian
fishing
in
puget
sound
to
account
for
all
of
the
fish
which
washington
citizens
have
taken
under
federal
licenses
in
the
open
ocean.
and
that's
the
reason
for
the
great
disparity
in
the
puget
sound
allocations
to
indians
and
non-indians.
so
every
one
really
manages
in
the
way
of
making
that
right
at
--
usual
and
accustomed
stations
will
by
a
proper
management
of
the
fish
and
pushing
the
fisheries
out
into
marine
waters
or
further
downstream.
even
if
--
excuse
me,
it
can't
be
over
emphasized
here
that
the
district
court
found
a
permanent
and
immutable
right.
it
did
not
fashion
a
remedy
for
alleged
discrimination.
the
tribes
in
their
amici
have
attempted
to
characterize
this
as
a
discrimination
case
and
if
the
sky
is
the
50%
plus
allocation
is
a
remedy.
perhaps
the
best
illustration
that's
not
the
case
is
the
ipsfc
fishery,
the
straits
fishery
and
canadian
fish.
that
fishery
on
canadian
bound
salmon
occurs
in
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
and
the
northern
puget
sound
in
the
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
of
fewer
than
one
third
of
the
tribes
who
are
parties
to
this
litigation.
there's
no
measured
--
no
significant
non-indian
harvest
before
the
fish
reach
those
usual
and
accustomed
grounds.
even
so,
the
district
court
found
that
those
eight
tribes
were
entitled
to
50%
of
the
catch,
a
right,
not
a
remedy.
we
feel
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
an
equal
opportunity
--
fishery
exists
now
or
if
not,
how
the
state
can
assure
it.
mr.
slade
gorton
i'm
sorry.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
issue
was
open
here
for
the
same
reason
that
the
--
an
issue
was
open
whenever
you
have
denied
certiorari
in
earlier
proceedings
in
the
same
case
and
later
accept
certiorari
in
connection
with
later
orders
in
the
same
case
involving
the
same
parties.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
solicitor
general
tells
you
that
you
should
not
judge
this
case
on
the
merits
because
we're
bad
people
is
essentially
what
it
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
it
amounts
to.
it's
rather
like
a
father
who
leaves
his
wallet
on
his
dresser
and
finds
$20
missing
the
next
morning
and
accuses
his
son
of
stealing
it.
the
son
curses
and
spits
at
him
and
the
father
later
founds
it
--
finds
the
$20
in
his
pocket.
obviously,
the
son
can
be
punished
for
contempt
but
mr.
claiborne
would
have
you
say
that
the
father
should
not
apologize
for
being
wrong
in
connection
with
the
$20
in
the
first
place.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
exactly.
we
are
the
son.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
slade
gorton
i'll
reserve
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
stewart,
mr.
claiborne
in
reading
from
the
solicitor
general's
instructions
said
that
he
skipped
a
little
bit,
here's
what
he
skipped.
in
any
case,
it
is
true
that
if
they
can
fish
to
advantage
elsewhere
than
at
the
particular
points
where
the
wheels
are,
they
should
be
allowed
to
fish
without
undue
restriction
up
and
down
the
river
and
above
them
below
the
wheels
throughout
the
entire
waterfront.
that's
exactly
what
my
point
to
you
was
as
you
asked
these
questions
about
the
empty
right,
the
right
to
fish
in
the
bathtub
beforehand.
they've
also
answered
that
question
as
the
united
states
has
always
carried
on
its
own
activities.
when
the
united
states
builds
or
licenses
a
dam,
(inaudible)
or
otherwise,
it
destroys
those
usual
and
accustomed
places
and
makes
them
bathtubs
and
gives
them
places
elsewhere
to
make
up
for
them.
my
example
about
the
management
--
mr.
slade
gorton
i
can't
answer
that
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
that
question
specifically.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
that's
exactly
what
the
state
proposes
to
do
in
managing
the
fishery
properly.
of
course,
if
we
must
let
those
fish
get
all
the
way
up
to
the
source,
into
the
source
of
the
river
so
that
a
hundred
fish
would
get
back
to
a
usual
and
accustomed
station
and
weighs
to
ten
thousand
fish
and
other
runs,
we
should
be
permitted
to
say
to
the
indians,
if
we
give
you
a
better
right
elsewhere
in
the
marine
waters
and
you
have
the
capabilities
of
exercising
your
right
better
there,
that
is
appropriate
management.
as
i
say,
it's
exactly
what
the
united
states
does.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
any
event,
i've
--
my
--
the
thrust
of
argument
is
that
in
winans
that's
what
you
said
by
asking
than
to
follow
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
the
solicitor
general
could
be
done
is
what
happens
when
dams
are
done.
you
are
correct.
if
we
can't
do
that,
if
we
must
return
those
hundred
of
fish
to
the
headwaters
then
there
must
be
an
allocation.
mr.
slade
gorton
or
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
clearly
does.
or
the
indians
can
be
given
an
at
least
equally
advantageous
place.
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
suggested
in
1905.
its
what
the
united
states
did
when
it
built
the
dams
and
its
what
an
equal
opportunity
fishery
properly
administered
will
actually
do.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
certainly
was
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
is
correct.
your
footnote
16
was
correctly
read.
remember
however
that
every
previous
case
dealt
with
a
river
fishery
where
perhaps
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
river
might
be
included
and
that
in
none
of
those
earlier
cases
was
that
characterization
of
a
reservation
versus
being
secured
remotely
necessary
to
the
decision
of
the
case.
they
were
all
correctly
stated.
i
believe
that
conceptually
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
non-indians
citizens
of
the
territory
of
washington
have
the
right
to
fish
in
puget
sound
before
the
treaties.
mr.
slade
gorton
no.
under
--
even
under
your
--
mr.
slade
gorton
they
are
entitled
to
an
equal
opportunity
of
fishery
and
whether
or
not
they've
been
given
an
equal
opportunity
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
they've
not.
whether
--
i
don't
think.
whether
they
have
an
equal
opportunity
of
fishery
involves
a
consideration
of
many
questions.
in
puyallup
ii
you
listed
some
of
those
questions.
the
number
of
nets,
the
number
of
fishermen
is
one
thing.
more
indians
fish
than
non-indians.
so
purely
per
capita,
we
would
not
necessarily
recognize
an
equal
opportunity
to
fish
for
indians.
it
might
be
one
factor
which
was
considered
but
it
would
be
only
one
factor
among
many.
i
tried
to
point
out
that
if
the
result
of
this
court's
decisions
right
now
is
an
equal
opportunity
of
fishery,
the
indian
share
will
be
infinitely
larger
than
the
non-indian
share.
mr.
slade
gorton
pardon?
mr.
slade
gorton
that
might
very
well
at
some
point,
a
large
--
to
bring
us
to
a
violation
of
the
treaty
because
we
were
preempting
the
non-indian
--
the
indian
fishery
as
we
were
in
puyallup
ii.
we
cannot
make
it
an
empty
right.
mr.
slade
gorton
but
we
are
not
required
to
allocate
50%
plus
or
any
fixed
number
or
any
--
mr.
slade
gorton
or
any
other
fixed
number
which
is
just
set
in
concrete
from
now
to
the
end
of
time.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
or
assure
--
mr.
slade
gorton
or
