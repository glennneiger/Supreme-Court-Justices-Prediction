mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
ought
to
begin
by
trying
to
indentify
the
central
issue
as
wee
see
it.
this
is
not
unlike
previous
cases
before
this
court,
a
case
about
whether
the
indian
right
to
fish
can
be
regulated
by
state
law.
that
point
is
conceded
at
the
outset.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
it
may.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
the
state
may
regulate
the
indian
fishing
right
provided
that
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
may
regulate
it
in
the
name
--
in
the
interest
of
conservation
when
that
is
necessary.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
question
mr.
justice
stewart
is
yes,
which
it
can
and
which
it
cannot
that
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
--
i
mean
only
to
say
this,
there's
no
claim
of
immunity
from
state
conservation
laws.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
the
case.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
how
those
conservation
or
allocation
laws
ought
to
be
accommodated
to
respect
the
treaty
right
and
that
leads
us
to
--
look
to
the
treaty
right
not
as
to
whether
it
immunizes
the
indian
fishing
right
from
all
state
regulation
but
what
the
character
of
it
is.
nor
is
the
case
as
the
state
now
seeks
to
make
it,
the
question
of
whether
the
indians
can
today
so
effectively
compete
that
they
no
longer
need
the
protection
which
the
treaties
afford
them.
if
the
treaties
afford
them
protection,
they're
entitled
to
it
whether
or
not
they
presently
need
it
or
will
for
some
years
to
come.
we
turn
then
to
the
character
of
the
right
which
is
secured
by
this
treaties.
and
the
issue
here
seems
to
be
whether
it
is
a
mere
right
of
access,
a
sort
of
liberty
to
go
off
the
reservation
and
go
fishing
if
there's
any
fish
to
find
there,
a
right
which
it
was
quite
unnecessary
to
provide
for,
even
then
there
was
no
thought
that
the
indians
were
confined
for
the
reservation
or
whether
rather
the
rights
secured
by
these
treaties
is
a
property
right,
a
share
in
the
fishery.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
that
respect
alone,
that
is
that
the
peculiarity
of
the
right
of
access
granted
by
the
treaty
is
said
to
be
as
winans'
held
that
it
includes
a
right
to
cross
private
property
a
right
not
otherwise
available
to
citizens.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
could
but
when
we
are
speaking
of
fishing
in
puget
sound,
that
is
of
course
a
meaningless
aspect
of
the
right.
when
we're
talking
about
the
columbian
river
as
was
the
case
in
winans,
the
right
of
access
to
the
riverbanks
is
important
because
those
rivers
or
that
river
could
not
be
fished
from
the
water.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
could
only
be
fished
from
the
bank.
but
with
respect
to
the
treaties
governing
puget
sound
that
aspect,
that
easement
would
be
for
the
most
part
of
no
value
whatever.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
treaties
are
all
of
the
pattern
mr.
justice
stewart.
no
doubt
some
of
them
had
in
mind
the
situation
on
the
columbia
as
did
the
treaty
with
the
yakimas
and
some
had
in
mind
the
situation
in
puget
sound
but
the
language
was
not
varied
in
accordance
with
the
circumstances.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
suggest
that
that
language
is
of
not
much
value
in
puget
sound.
it
is
of
some
value
along
riverbanks.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
indeed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
stevens
those
are
banks
--
those
areas
are
fished
by
both,
not
from
the
bank
and
as
long
as
there
is
a
place
where
others
are
public
access
to
the
strait,
it
matters
not
whether
it's
adjacent
to
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
grounds.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that's
so.
now,
as
to
which
it
is,
whether
its
on
your
right
of
access
or
whether
it's
a
share
of
the
fishery
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
course,
of
course.
we
--
and
we
say
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
meant
to
suggest
that
it
is
more
it
is
a
share
in
the
fishery.
it
is
not
a
mere
right
of
access.
and
as
to
resolving
that
question
we
look
first
to
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself
and
as
has
been
sufficiently
pointed
out,
the
language
of
the
treaty
does
not
give
a
right
of
access
to
water,
it
gives
a
right
of
taking
fish.
that
is
at
least
suggestive
that
we're
talking
about
a
right
in
a
fishery
not
a
means
of
getting
there.
the
other
word
which
is
in
my
submission
significant
on
the
wording
of
the
treaty
itself
is
the
word
"secured".
now,
the
--
it's
been
suggested
that
that
may
suggest
that
there
was
a
grant
from
the
united
states
rather
than
the
reservation
by
the
indians.
i've
had
viewed
--
that
question
is
foreclosed
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
beginning
in
winans
where
that
was
very
expressly
held
down
to
the
most
recent
in
puyallup
iii
in
which
that
same
view
of
the
article
iii
language
was
taken
that
it
was
a
reservation
of
former
exclusive
rights
which
the
indians
enjoyed,
which
the
tribes
enjoyed
not
a
grant
by
the
united
states
of
a
fishing
right
to
them.
but
turning
to
the
word
"secured"
the
significance
of
that
language
it
seems
to
us
is
that
it
promises
the
protection,
the
security
of
the
united
states
government
to
assure
that
the
right
of
taking
fish
will
not
in
the
future
be
interfered
with.
not
an
insignificant
promise.
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
go
by
stages
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
say
it's
a
guarantee
against
encroachments
or
interferences
with
the
right
to
fish
in
particularized
locations.
encroachments
can
come
in
many
guises.
the
most
obvious
is
that
which
the
court
constructed
--
confronted
in
winans,
that
is
the
ousting
of
the
indians
by
the
emplacement
of
a
fish
wheel
or
the
building
of
a
fence
which
prevents
their
access
to
the
site.
but
it
can
come
in
other
ways,
one,
you'd
only
think
of
a
dam
created
downstream
which
prevented
the
fish
from
reaching
the
usual
indian
fishing
place.
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
sort
of
encroachment
also
which
the
united
states
was
securing
the
indian
right
to
fish
against.
and
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
state
regulations
which
have
precisely
that
effect.
and
one
such
regulation
was
the
one
that
this
court
confronted
in
puyallup
ii
in
which
albeit
the
indians
like
everyone
else
was
free
to
catch
steelhead
by
hook
and
line
downstream.
they
were
prevented
from
doing
it
in
their
usual
and
accustomed
way
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
place
by
nets
upstream.
and
the
court
said,
"this
--
preventing
the
fish
from
reaching
them
in
harvestable
numbers
is
an
interference
with
their
treaty
right".
that
is
precisely
what
this
case
is
about.
now
the
fact
that
the
treaty
language
itself
suggests
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
--
if
one
puts
together
the
separate
accustomed
fishing
grounds
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
tribe
as
the
statement
has
suggested
that
i
suggest
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
i
--
mr.
justice
white
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
because
the
individual
treaties
give
individual
tribes
particularized
locations
and
beyond
that
area,
they
are
not
protected
by
the
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
gives
some
tribes
of
protected
right
to
fish
in
some
parts
of
puget
sound.
it
gives
other
tribes
rights
elsewhere
and
it
--
and
so
on.
the
--
it
is
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
and
indeed
the
district
judge
very
particularly
identified
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
grounds
of
each
of
the
tribes,
not
only
those
conferred
by
each
treaty
but
each
of
the
tribes
covered
by
the
five
treaties.
and
they
overlap
but
they
don't
all
cover
the
entire
area
by
any
means.
and
the
tribes
of
--
such
as
the
nisqually
and
the
puyallup
at
the
bottom
of
the
puget
sound
had
no
rights
in
the
strait
nor
even
in
the
upper
part
of
the
sound.
it
may
happen
and
perhaps
the
district
judge
was
over
generous
in
defining
usual
and
accustomed
places
that
the
--
when
you
add
all
of
these
rights
together
you
cover
the
entire
area.
but
the
state
makes
no
objection
to
that.
the
reason
they
do
not
as
if
they
want
to
be
able
to
say
these
indians
can
compete
quite
adequately
with
us
in
effect
everywhere.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
say
that
the
tribes
of
the
lower
sound
had
been
promised,
had
been
secured
or
the
right
which
they
reserved
and
which
was
always
there
to
fish
in
their
rivers,
at
the
mouths
of
their
rivers
and
nearby.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
right
to
take
fish
there
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
--
in
mr.
justice
white's
example,
they'd
be
prevented
from
attempting
to
take
fish
and
that
in
less
that
were
essentials
of
conservation
which
your
example
does
not
suggest
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
be
about
instruments
treaty?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white
i
think
i
have
to
differ
with
him
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
on
that
point.
it
seems
to
me
that,
there's
two
ways
of
looking
at
it,
he
needs
of
course
an
accident
of
history
that
there
were
five
treaties
rather
than
one,
its
simply
the
fact
that
governor
stevens
couldn't
bring
the
indians
into
one
location
at
one
time.
but
nevertheless,
we
are
faced
with
five
different
treaties
in
immediate
sequence
but
still
one
before
the
other.
i
think
perhaps
the
proper
way
to
look
at
it
is
to
say
that
the
50%
share
which
we
say
is
simply
a
limit
on
the
indian
right.
not
the
definition
of
the
right,
it's
the
consequence
of
the
"in
common
with"
language.
that
50%
share
applied
only
to
so
much
of
the
run
as
in
those
days
after
indian
fishing
further
out
reached
that
location.
in
that
way
when
--
or
confines
the
makah,
the
head
of
the
strait
to
a
proportion
that
must
allow
a
reasonable
share
to
reach
those
at
the
end
of
the
ladder
of
(inaudible)
the
nisqually.
now,
the
district
judge
did
not
attempt
to
make
those
allocations
and
as
it
happens,
the
indian
tribes
of
the
area
or
in
a
cooperative
spirit,
they
have
formed
the
fisheries
commission
of
their
own.
and
they
themselves
are
police
or
these
allocation
problems
to
the
extent
that
they
exist
and
they
exist
to
a
very
minor
extent
because
the
capability
of
any
given
tribe
to
catch
a
numbers
of
fish
that
would
prejudice
their
neighbors
is
not
yet
at
least
serious.
it
may
also
bee
that
governor
stevens
overpromised
and
we
must
accumulate
for
that
today.
no
one
suggests
that
one
should
add
50%
shares
so
as
to
the
non-indians
a
lesser
less
than
of
the
total.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
the
district
court
merely
said
that
the
total
indian
share
are
ought
not
exceed
50%.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
consequence
of
this
being
a
reservation
of
a
right
rather
than
the
grant
by
the
united
states.
it
seems
to
me
that
helps
us
in
determining
what
is
really
--
the
next
question
is
assuming
the
indians
have
a
share
in
this
fishery,
what
sort
of
share.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
obviously
misspoke.
i
meant
to
say
that
the
in
common
which
--
"in
common
with"
language
is
precisely
how
we
get
to
the
50%
language
but
in
this
sense
that
what
was
promised
to
the
tribes
was
the
right
to
fish
as
they
used
to
without
--
basically
without
limit
for
commercial
and
other
purpose.
so
much
as
was
necessary
to
satisfy
their
reasonable
needs.but
they
were
required
to
share
the
fisheries
with
non-indians
and
that
of
course
is
indicated
by
the
words
in
common.
we
say
it
may
be
right
indeed
probably
is
right
to
read
that
"in
common
with"
language
as
placing
a
50%
limit
on
the
indian
share.
they
may
satisfy
their
needs
but
no
more
than
50%.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
explicitly
said
in
its
most
recent
decision
in
puyallup.
this
former
exclusive
rights
of
the
tribes
are
--
must
now
be
shared
with
non-indians
for
--
because
the
treaty
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
gave
that
much
away
in
the
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
only
quoting
this
court's
decision
in
puyallup
which
of
course
involved
the
river,
well
(inaudible).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
justice
stevens
i
believe
it
occurs
--
on
page
176
of
the
433rd
volume
of
the
united
states
reports
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
433
u.s.page
176,
footnote
16
in
referring
to
article
iii
which
is
quoted
this
being
article
iii
of
--
i
believe
the
treaty
of
medicine
creek
but
at
all
events,
same
language
is
this.
well,
after
the
quotation
of
the
treaty,
the
opinion
goes
on
to
say
as
to
the
treaty
fishermen,
this
sentence,
the
sentence
securing
"in
common
with"
affixed
a
reservation
of
a
previously
exclusive
right.
now
that
is
--
in
our
submission
the
exactly
accurate
characterization.
it's
a
reservation
and
it's
a
right
which
was
previously
exclusive
to
the
tribes
of
the
area.they
might
have
retained
their
exclusive
right.
they
were
persuaded
to
share
it.
when
one
looks
at
it
from
that
certain
point,
it
is
not
surprising
that
one
may
be
entitled
to
conclude
that
they
didn't
give
away
at
least
more
than
half
of
the
right
which
they
previously
enjoyed
alone.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
gave
up
most
of
their
land
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
all
of
the
state
of
washington,
west
of
the
cascade
mountains.
these
particular
tribes
that
were
concerned
with
in
this
case
and
they
received
some
payment
but
primarily
and
as
dr.
lane
who
as
an
anthropologist
wrote
a
report
fully
accepted
by
the
district
judge
accurately
summarized
those
treaty
negotiations.
the
indians
were
talking
not
about
the
usual
things
about
farm
implements
and
or
even
about
money.they
kept
on
talking
about
their
fish.that
was
their
concern.
and
it
was
well-known
to
both
governor
stevens
and
mr.
gibbs
that
they
had
to
be
satisfied
that
they
would
keep
fisheries.
governor
stevens
said
in
so
many
words
this
paper
secures
your
fish.
that
is
the
text
on
which
we
rely.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
to
some
extent
the
historical
assumption
is
--
must
be
qualified
by
the
fact
that
there
were
indeed
other
people
already
who
had
come
there,
the
donation
act
in
1850
had
invited
settlers
to
come
into
the
oregon
territory
which
included
all
of
washington
and
much
else.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
but
what
is
in
the
bottom
to
--
is
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
recognized
that
the
indian
title,
the
indian
occupancy
was
exclusive
and
ought
to
be
ended
by
a
treaty.
it
is
not
as
though
by
gradual
process,
the
white
men
had
pushed
of
the
indian
side.
it
was
a
deliberate
determination
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
buy
what
was
--
for
the
purposes
of
the
treaty
recognized
to
be
an
indian
claim
of
exclusive
occupancy
of
both
land
and
rivers
and
of
course
the
fish
that
migrated
there.
as
i
say
the
indians
might
have
reserved
their
right
altogether
as
indeed
they
did
in
alaska
or
as
this
court
found
that
they
had
in
alaska.
whether
they
reserved
90%
of
it,
60%
of
it,
10%
of
it
are
--
cannot
invoke
any
questions
of
discrimination
or
equal
protection
or
fairness.
they
were
entitled
to
keep
it
all.
they
conceded
the
right
of
others
to
fish
them
or
at
worst
that
ought
to
be
viewed
as
conceding
a
half
of
their
previously
exclusive
fishery.
set
me,
we
say
they
did
not
buy
a
future
in
which
they
might
be
ousted
or
nearly
ousted
from
their
traditional
fisheries
simply
because
the
white
man
of
--
in
greater
numbers
and
with
superior
technology
would
crowd
out
the
indian.
now
it's
perfectly
true
that
at
the
time
there
was
no
knowledge
of
--
the
future
need
for
conservation
restrictions.
but
what
was
anticipated
even
then
or
must
have
been
is
first
that
the
indian
might
be
fenced
out
of
his
fishing
place
cause
that
had
happened.
white
men
had
come
and
fenced
out
an
indian
even
before
the
treaties.
and
so
the
language
which
protects
their
fishing
places
through
the
easement
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
winans.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
have
mr.
justice
stewart
and
it
gives
me
an
occasion
to
correct
an
impression
which
is
perhaps
been
left
with
the
court,
i'm
sure
inadvertently
by
the
attorney
general.
that
is
the
solicitor
general
was
suggesting
that
they
go
fish
elsewhere.
now,
that
is
precisely
what
he
was
combating.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
was
not
doing
that.
in
fact
he
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
devoted
most
of
his
brief
to
the
proposition
that
the
indians
had
been
promised
a
right
to
fish
there
not
elsewhere
whether
there
were
other
places
was
not
ahead
of
that.
and
i
cite
or
quote
language
from
page
16
of
the
brief
filed
by
solicitor
general
in
what
was
number
180
of
the
october
term
1904.
there
is
--
there
was
a
general
allegation
in
the
answer
he
says
that
there
were
fisheries
at
places
where
the
title
was
still
in
the
government.
but
that
suggestion
was
left
vague
and
there
was
no
proof
on
the
subject.
in
any
event
the
indians
have
rights
here
or
they
have
not.
they
cannot
be
shunted
off
to
inferior
places
on
the
theory
that
it
is
a
legitimate
defense
to
say
they
--
that
will
do
--
they
will
do
well
enough
at
other
points.
besides
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
did
suggest
and
if
i
can
turn
to
his
precise
suggestion,
they
were
four
fish
wheels
in
the
case
which
monopolized
that
at
least
the
location
was
where
the
wheels
were.
he
says,
it
sets
--
it
seems
that
four
wheels
in
the
space
of
a
mile
and
a
half
are
inordinate.
if
they
ought
to
be
maintained
at
all,
there
should
be
some
restriction
as
to
their
number
and
method
and
daily
hours
of
operation,
restriction
on
the
winan
brothers
in
order
to
give
the
fish
and
the
indians
a
chance.
certainly
the
wheels
should
not
be
permitted
to
create
and
maintain
a
monopoly
until
all
the
fish
are
gone.
one
at
least
of
these
wheels
has
been
placed
at
a
particular
spot
which
was
obviously
a
most
advantageous
place
for
the
indians
to
fish
because
there
was
a
great
rock
there
from
which
their
platform
or
stage
in
projected
so
that
they
could
use
their
deep
nets
for
the
longest
possible
time
without
being
given
back
--
up
the
bank,
a
bluff
by
rising
water.
i
skipped
a
little
and
then
--
referring
now
to
the
indians
on
the
other
hand,
they
cannot
claim
to
have
an
exclusive
right
and
enjoying
their
right
"in
common
with"
citizen
and
under
the
modified
injunction
"in
common
with"
defendants,
it
may
be
just
to
restrict
in
reasonable
ways
there
times
and
modes
of
access
to
the
property
and
hours
for
fishing.
it
is
not
fair
under
the
present
conditions
that
they
should
enjoy
without
restriction
their
ancient
right
of
camping
and
curing
in
temporary
houses
on
the
defendant's
property.
if
it
is
unfair,
a
decree
can
indicate
the
proper
limitation.
it
may
be
that
there
ought
to
be
some
composition
of
that
right
or
some
arrangement
by
the
defendants
or
the
united
states
or
both.
that's
as
far
as
the
suggestion
goes.
but
it
clearly
is
a
suggestion
that
fishing
at
that
place
ought
to
be
in
some
manner
divided
in
terms
of
ours
or
it
would
owe
us
for
the
indians
to
fish,
ours
for
the
wheels
to
offer
it.
now
we
say
that
that
is
the
most
obvious
abuse
that
involved
in
winans
but
to
do
this,
it
is
equally
impermissible
to
prevent
not
the
indians
from
reaching
the
fishing
places
but
the
fish
from
reaching
them
which
empties
the
right
to
fish
at
those
locations
of
any
substance.
and
that
is
what
the
structure
of
the
regulations
which
are
--
which
had
been
annulled
in
this
case
accomplished
to
prevent
a
fair
or
equal
share
of
the
fish
which
through
this
funnel
of
the
strait
and
then
the
sound
eventually
reach
the
majority
of
the
fishing
sites,
the
traditional
sites
which
are
in
the
sound,
at
the
mouths
of
the
rivers.
to
fish
out
--
to
allow
the
fishery
to
be
fished
out
before
the
fish
get
to
the
places
is
as
much
a
violation
of
the
treaty
as
to
prevent
the
indians
from
reaching
it
at
all.
leave
to
them.
