rehnquist
general
gorton,
does
the
state
take
any
provision
as
to
whether
any
position
rather
as
to
whether
the
treaty
was
or
was
not
self
executing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily
a
non-self
executing
treaty
requires
legislation
by
congress
not
by
the
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
essential
question
is
what
under
the
treaty
the
state
had
the
right
to
do
it
and
what
it
didn't,
is
it
not
mr.
morisset?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
that
thing
not
being
of
much
value,

of
juan

fuca
means
anything,
there
is
a
very
substantial
stretch
of
land
where
access
rights
to
the
strait
would
mean
something,
i
would
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
strictly
both
fishing
in
the
strait?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
assumes
that
the
indians
had
a
100%

the
treaty.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
exclusive
rights
in
all
the
waterways
out
to
the

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
tribes
give
up
in
the
treaty
of
medicine
creek?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
that
the
whole
