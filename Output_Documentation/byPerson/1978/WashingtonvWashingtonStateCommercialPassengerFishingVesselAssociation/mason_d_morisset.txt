mr.
mason
d.
morisset
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
mason
morisset
appearing
for
the
respondent
indian
tribes
in
this
case.
it
becomes
no
shock
to
you
that
i
disagree
with
attorney
general
gorton
as
to,
firstly,
everything
he
said
concerning
the
facts,
the
nature
of
this
case,
the
nature
of
the
dispute.
the
district
judge
in
a
related
case
u.s.
versus
oregon,
judge
belloni
once
said
when
these
arguments
were
made
to
him.
these
arguments
might
make
some
sense
and
i'm
paraphrasing,
if
we
ignore
our
history,
law,
facts
of
the
case
and
the
behavior
of
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington.
now
we
cannot
ignore
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
cannot
ignore
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
state
of
washington
had
preempted
indian
fishing
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
put
it
in
its
original
decision,
its
now
three
years
old.
the
state
of
washington
has
"rendered
the
treaty
guarantee
nugatory".
to
remember
what
the
state
has
done
here
is
important.
the
state
began
in
1890
by
outlawing
salmon
fishing
during
certain
times
of
the
year.
they
continued
in
1915
to
outlaw
fishing
by
gaffing
and
spearing,
traditional
indian
methods.
in
1897,
the
legislative
studies
closing
freshwater
fishing
to
commercial
salmon
fisher
in
--
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
and
that
was
continuous
from
1900
on.
that
had
the
effect
of
precluding
much
indian
fishing.
by
1940,
we
find
the
salmon
preserve
which
is
--
you
will
examine
their
map
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
348
effectively
closed
most
of
the
indian
areas.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
the
essential
question,
yes.
and
it's
clear
as
the
district
court
found
in
going
to
the
solicit
--
state
actions
that
the
total
effect
of
this
was
to
preclude
a
treaty
fishery
for
all
practical
purposes.
you
have
to
put
together
all
the
things
to
state
did.
i'm
only
to
1915
and
we've
got
quite
a
few
things.
he
continued
wih
the
pattern
if
i
know
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
true,
be
conceivable.
but
the
judge
had
to
decide,
had
to
make
some
basis
or
have
some
basis
for
his
finding
that
there
in
fact
had
been
a
preemption
of
the
treaty
right
and
this
is
what
he
found
that
all
of
these
actions
had
the
cumulative
effect
of
ending
any
treaty
right
whatsoever.
given
that,
he
had
to
move
on
--
yes.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
yes.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
first
of
all
the
practical
matter
that
virtually
can't
happen.
but
let's
presume
that
it
does
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
alright.
the
answer
is
very
simple.
if
the
state
of
washington
does
not
preempt
the
fishery,
the
indian
share
the
fishery
and
the
makahs
catch
all
of
the
indian
opportunity,
that
ends
the
state's
obligation
vis-à-vis
the
indians.
that
becomes
an
intertribal
problem
for
them
to
work
out.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
undoubtedly,
against
the
makahs
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
--
but
not
against
the
state
of
wahsington.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
right.
they
probably
do.
that's
not
this
case
knowing
it
sued
the
united
states
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
--
no
tribes
have
sued
each
other.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well,
it
may
test
it
vis-à-vis
an
action
against
the
united
states
or
tribes.
but
it
simply
proves
the
point
to
the
state
of
washington
has
met
its
obligations
if
it
has
not
preempted
the
indian
share
which
it
would
not
have
under
your
facts.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well
the
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
the
district
court
found
that
the
state
of
washington
had
prevented
any
tribes
anywhere
basically
from
taking
its
share
of
the
fish.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no
it
isn't
on
their
decision.
it
is
not
required
to
make
allocations
between
the
tribes.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
of
washington
has
an
obligation
under
the
treaties
to
allocate
fish
among
the
tribes
as
a
matter
for
them,
between
themselves
or
for
them
in
the
united
states
government.
the
state
of
washington
doesn't
have
that
obligation.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
no.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
you're
misstating
what
it's
in
trouble
of,
of
what
it
did.
its
in
trouble
if
it
allows
the
fishery
to
be
preempted
by
the
non-indian
fishermen
which
is
what
it
has
done
in
this
case.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
when
it's
in
trouble.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
right.
now
of
course
we
have
a
major
battle
over
that
between
the
tribes
and
the
united
states
government.
but
that's
not
the
state's
obligation
under
the
treaty.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well,
he
intended
to
allow
the
signatories
to
any
one
treaty
and
there
are
five
major
ones
and
sixth
that
--
as
a
peripheral
interest
here
to
receive
as
the
district
court
found.
50%
of
the
harvestable
share
or
an
opportunity
catch,
50%
of
the
harvestable
share
of
fish
reaching
their
usual
and
accustomed
places.
he
did
not
guarantee
that
any
fish
would
reach
there.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well,
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
stevens
but
certainly
the
indians
and
governor
stevens
knew
that
there
were
a
lot
of
indians
from
different
tribes
and
bands
that
would
all
be
fishing
together.
and
he
knew
there
were
other
tribes
and
bands
that
would
be
intercepting
fish
before
they
got
there.
and
they
simply
were
talking
about
what
was
going
to
be
left
when
it
got
to
their
place
understanding
that
there
would
probably
be
preemption
by
other
indian
tribe
before
it
got
there
or
some
fishing
on
those
runs.
we're
not
talking
about
that
kind
of
a
situation,
we're
talking
about
the
situation
in
which
the
state
to
this
long
history
of
legislative
action
has
allowed
the
nontreaty
fisherman
to
essentially
preempt
the
entire
fishery.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
situation
where
the
tribe
--
one
tribe
or
the
other
may
catch
most
of
the
tribal
share
before
it
gets
to
a
particular
river.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
not
in
the
sense
that
they
must
guarantee
freedom
from
acts
of
god
and
freedom
from
interceptions
by
other
indian
tribes.
this
is
not
an
affirmative
duty
to
guarantee
that
fish
get
back
to
the
rivers
or
the
marine
areas
which
decide
the
table
sometime
it
claims.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
right
because
of
the
history
of
how
they've
done
it.
from
--
i
got
up
to
the
salmon
preserve
area
and
i
could've
gone
on
for
another
18
points
about
how
the
entire
regulatory
scheme
has
essentially
preempted
the
fishery
to
a
particular
segment
of
the
population
namely
the
high
technology
motorized
vessels.
and
that
is
what
the
state
has
done
through
an
entire
pattern
of
laws
and
regulations
that
the
court
found
to
be
wrong.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
oh,
i'm
not
sure
how
they're
using
the
phrase
"equal
opportunity".
they
seemed
to
be
using
it
in
the
old
hackneyed
version
of
the
same
--
as
every
one
else
which
i
thought
we'd
gone
through
since
winans
on
through
puyallup
and
entwined
in
these
various
other
cases.
if
they're
using
it
in
that
sense,
that
in
effect
is
no
treaty
right
at
all.
they're
simply
back
to
the
beginning
point
again.
if
that's
what
the
attorney
general
means,
i
disagree
with
that.
i'd
like
to
move
on
to
discuss
the
question
of
--
the
point
"in
common
with"
means
and
once
again
to
disagree
with
how
the
question
was
put.
we
don't
view
this
as
a
question
of
what
"in
common
with"
means
by
itself.
this
is
among
other
things
a
contract
and
it
must
be
construed
as
a
whole
to
all
its
parts
and
certainly
the
entirely
phrase,
the
right
taking
fish
which
is
the
first
right
at
certain
places
which
is
the
second
right,
as
limited
by
or
explained
by
the
phrase
"in
common
with".
and
we
think
it
is
a
hopeless
quagmire
to
focus
solely
on
"in
common
with"
although
we
played
the
game
in
our
briefs
to
and
got
into
all
sorts
of
esoteric
british
treaty
cases
and
so
on
none
of
which
i
think
anyone
could
understand.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
right.
and
i
think
someone
made
the
point
that
we
probably
are
viewing
secretary
gibbs
who
was
a
lawyer
as
having
a
much
more
erudite
education
than
he
probably
had.
i
mean,
he
did
know
about
these
things.
those
are
helpful
but
i
think
the
important
thing
for
us
to
get
across
is
that
we
must
construe
the
treaty
as
a
whole.
it
was
designed
to
guarantee
that
the
indians
would
continue
to
make
a
good
livelihood
from
fishing.
the
record
is
full
of
evidence
and
their
findings
of
fact
which
support
that.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
i
don't
think
he
erred.
i
think
that
it's
a
little
dangerous
to
try
to
pigeon
hole
this
whole
process
as
the
state
has
and
try
to
say
this
was
purely
a
legal
decision
or
purely
an
equitable
decision.
i
think
it
was
admixture
and
there
were
elements
of
both.
i
think
he
exercised
more
equity
in
deciding
whether
or
not
it
was
necessary
to
have
an
allocation
at
all
which
he
looked
at
all
the
facts.
once
he
decided
that,
he
decided
more
or
else
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
--
but
that's
what
it
was.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
one
of
the
rationales
that
he
used,
yes.
i
think
all
of
the
facts
in
the
case
support
that
finding.
there
was
a
substantial
amount
of
understanding
on
the
indian
side
of
equality
which
i
don't
know
if
that
meant
50%
but
it
certainly
meant
no
restrictions
on
either
side.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
don't
ever
agree
with
mr.
gorton
to
much.
he
doesn't
quite
understand
the
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
he
doesn't
quite
understand
federal
indian
law.
the
one
reason
we
have
the
entire
claims
commission
is
that
--
is
because
of
the
problem
that
treaties
were
not
signed
with
many
indians
and
the
courts
have
generally
held
that
aboriginal
claims
of
what
he
was
really
talking
about
have
been
extinguished
either
by
conquest
or
political
action
of
the
united
states.
and
those
people
don't
have
rights
because
there's
been
essentially
a
taking
of
them.
and
they've
been
paid
for
them.
and
that's
one
reason
they
don't
have
rights.
it
doesn't
mean
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
--
that
they
didn't
have
them
at
some
point.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
there
are
some
in
the
southwestern
part
of
the
state.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
they
are
citizens
--
as
far
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that
its
places
only
and
none
of
the
other
tribes
would
have
rights,
they
would've
had
a
claim
for
taking
which
is
what
all
these
pages
and
pages
of
claims
commission
cases
are
about
as
well
as
the
land
claims.
but
there
are
also
--
are
claims
for
taking
of
aboriginal
fishing
rights.
now,
finally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
the
said
indians
problem
which
several
justices,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
concerned
about,
and
ask
you
to
read
when
you
--
if
you
get
a
chance,
the
entire
treaty
i
pointed
out,
its
in
our
big
red
brief.
you
see
that
said
indians
and
said
tribe
and
band
is
used
interchangeably.
article
ix
which
is
the
(inaudible)
provision
jumps
all
over
the
place
between
said
tribes
and
bands
and
said
indians.
article
ii
says
we
reserve
as
a
reservation
for
said
tribes
and
bands
the
following
the
lands,
that's
a
reservation
for
the
said
tribes
and
bands.
article
v
says
to
help
the
said
indians
remove
there,
we're
going
to
pay
them
so
much
money.
and
if
you
go
on
through
the
treaty
contrary
to
what
the
attorney
general
says,
you'll
see,
said
tribes
and
bands
and
said
indians
being
used
both
ways
and
i
think
the
only
fair
discussion
of
what
that
means
is
that
they
were
interchangeable
phrases.
and
the
"said
indians"
meant
the
tribes
and
bands
and
tribes
and
bands
meant
the
"said
indians".
there's
really
no
other
way
to
get
at
what
that
phrase
meant.
my
time
has
expired
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
yes.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
as
to
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
oh,
article
ii
of
the
point
elliot
treaty
reserves
certain
lands
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
now
let's
see,
article
iii
doesn't
have
the
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
in
this
treaty,
it's
a
different
--
i'm
sorry,
here's
a
different
article.
article
v
in
this
treaty,
it
says,
secured
to
said
indians.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
right,
and
i
--
yes,
i
think
you're
right.
the
answer
is
--
i
think
again
there
that
that's
a
use
of
terms
interchangeably
and
certainly
this
court
has
always
said
before
us,
see
no
good
reason
to
change
it
that
this
was
a
reservation
of
rights
that
the
indians
had
before
the
treaties.
mr.
chief
justice.
