justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
just
ask
that
the
mortgage
payments
be
made,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
any
balance
to
unsecured
creditors?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
your
request
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
benefit
of
secondary
lien
holders
and
the
unsecured
creditors.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
trustee
didn't
have
to
pay
or
they
didn't
have
to
do
anything
more
than
pay
the
payments
as
they
can
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
suppose
there
was
more
current
income
than
necessary
to
pay
the
mortgage
payments.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
to
the
balance?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
sound
like
but
you
ask
for
here.
you
didn't
accel
--
was
the
--
did
you
accelerate
the
--
did
you
declare
all
of
the
entire
balance
due
in
these
mortgages?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
this
occurred
after
â€“
did
this
petition
and
order
occur
after
bankruptcy,
after
straight
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
after
straight
bankruptcy
occurred,
you
could
have
asked
that
their
property
be
abandoned
to
you
and
i
guess
you
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
until
you
did
that
you
did
nothing
else
in
order
to
try
to
get
the
rents?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
and
the
judge
said
well
and
what
happened
was
it
was
put
into
straight
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
a
secured
creditor
if
he
doesn't
want
to
file
a
security
claim
and
proceed,
what
do
they
usually
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
straight
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
the
court
of
appeals,
i
gather
that
court
of
appeals
thought
that
you
had
not
then
whatever
is
that
north
carolina
law
should
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
are
you
asking
us
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
north
carolina
law
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
are
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
mistake
as
to
north
carolina
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ryan
what
about
the
provision
in
the
mortgage
that
the
mortgagee
will
have
benefit
of
the
rents?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
what
if
there
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it's
valid
under
the
state
law
then
automatically
in
bankruptcy
the
secured
creditors
gets
the
benefits
of
the
rents?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
this
whole
argument
is
settled
by
careful
drafting?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
may
be,
i
wonder
what's
your
government
position
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
that
in
a
chapter
xi
proceeding,
not
in
straight
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
cannot
move
directly
in
the
north
carolina
courts,
can
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
must
go
to
--
in
addition
to
north
carolina
law
then
he
must
get
permission
of
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
may
be
quite
a
while
until
he
can
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
an
adversary
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
meanwhile
what
happens
to
the
rents?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
what
happens
to
the
rents
meanwhile?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
it
be
spent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
administration
expenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
if
there
is
an
adversary
proceeding
and
one
side
or
the
other
wins
and
the
other
looses,
then
there
is
an
appeal.
and
what
happens
to
the
rents
meanwhile?
the
secured
creditor
says
i
sure
would
like
go
into
the
north
carolina
courts
and
obey
north
carolina
law,
but
apparently
the
bankruptcy
act
wont
let
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
because
i
need
protection
meanwhile?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
is
a
big
equity
in
the
property
wouldn't
you
suppose
the
bankruptcy
court
would
deny
the
right
to
foreclose.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
sure
--
in
chapter
xi
though
the
notion
is
to
pay
the
debts
you
go
along
and
but
at
the
same
time,
chapter
xi
isn't
supposed
to
be
able
to
hold
off
secured
creditors
unless
you
pay
them,
is
it?
now
what
happens
in
chapter
xi,
if
the
secured
creditor
may
not
move
in
because
it's
an
arrangement
to
pay
off
the
creditors,
isn't
it?
isn't
there
and
there
was
an
order
not
to
foreclose?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
i
know
there
is
an
automatic
stay
in
chapter
xi
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
plan
is
scuttled
completely
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
the
property
is
abandoned.
that's
the
end
of
the
plan.
