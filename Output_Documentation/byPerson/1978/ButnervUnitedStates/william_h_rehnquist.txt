justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
the
courts
of
appeals
in
their
split
treat
it
as
a
question
of
federal
law
on
which
that
they
disagree
or
do
they
treat
it
as
questions
of
state
law
arising
within
their
various
circuits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
any
of
the
courts
that
appeals
take
the
position
that
if
the
creditor
had
provided
for
in
the
mortgage
agreement
that
the
rent
should
secure
the
security
that
would
not
be
followed
by
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
mortgagee
can
protect
himself
within
any
other
circuits
by
putting
a
provision
in
the
mortgage
agreement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
the
priority
--
what
are
comparable
priorities
between
cost
of
administration
and
rents
in
a
situation
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
not
entitled
to
say
there
is
not
enough
to
pay
the
cost
of
administration,
so
i
won't
abandon
the
property
for
that
reason?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
a
bankruptcy
judge
had
done
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
â€“
three
north
carolina
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
panel
you
have
the
opinion,
district
courts
of
north
carolina
the
back
yet.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
argue
a
[voice
overlap],
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
there
was
a
petition
for
abandonment
that
was
denied?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
my
only
question
to
you
was
with
response
to
your
statement
that
you
had
never
seen
a
bankruptcy
court
turn
down
a
petition
for
abandonment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
abandonment
would
have
meant
there
wasn't
sufficient
to
equity
over
and
above
the
security
to
make
it
worthwhile
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
hang
on
to
it,
wouldn't
it?
