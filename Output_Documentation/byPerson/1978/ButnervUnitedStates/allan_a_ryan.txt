mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
all
sides
agree
that
this
case
has
not
answered
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
not
answered
by
the
bankruptcy
act
as
such
and
if
i
may
refer
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
posed
earlier,
i
think
that
the
new
bankruptcy
act
will
not
be
anymore
helpful
than
the
old
one
was.
i
don't
think
the
new
bankruptcy
act
will
answer
this
question
anymore
clearly
than
it
is
answered
now
so
that
although
rents
specifically
are
mentioned,
the
question
is
whether
the
mortgage
interest
overrides
that
right
to
rents.
i
think
it's
also
fair
to
say
that
all
sides
agree
in
this
case
that
had
golden
enterprises
not
gone
into
bankruptcy,
the
petitioner
as
mortgagee
would
have
had
no
right
under
north
carolina
law
to
the
rents
unless
and
until
he
instituted
a
foreclosure
action
and
obtained
the
appointment
of
a
receiver
to
collect
the
rents
for
him
and
where
we
part
company
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioner
says
that
bankruptcy
makes
all
the
difference
after
that
fact
and
we
say
it
really
makes
no
difference
at
all.
specifically
we
recognize
that
once
the
property
here
came
under
the
aegis
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
which
in
this
case
was
when
the
chapter
xi
petitioner's
filed,
the
petitioner
was
no
longer
free
to
begin
foreclosure
and
seek
the
appointment
of
a
receiver
without
the
permission
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
petitioner
argues
that
from
that
fact
alone
he
was
entitled
to
the
rents
as
an
equitable
matter
and
we
believe
on
the
other
hand
that
just
as
the
petitioner
would
have
been
required
under
state
law
to
take
some
affirmative
step
to
reach
the
rents
in
the
absence
of
bankruptcy
so
he
should
be
required
to
take
some
affirmative
step
to
reach
them
once
bankruptcy
occurred.
although
foreclosure
in
the
state
court
and
appointment
of
receiver
in
a
state
court
were
barred
to
him,
other
steps
were
not
as
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment.
the
petitioner
argues
and
he
places
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
this
that
even
if
we
are
correct
in
that
reading
of
north
carolina
law
and
i
don't
understand
him
to
disagree
with
us
on
that,
he
did
pursue
an
alternate
course
sufficient
to
protect
his
interest.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
holding
that
he
did
not
do
so,
and
finally
we
believe
that
even
if
the
minority
view
of
the
circuits
and
the
view
of
the
petitioner
is
correct
that
equity
should
prevail
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
that
petitioner
has
suffered
no
loss
looking
at
the
transaction
as
a
whole
and
therefore
that
equity
should
not
require
that
the
rents
be
handed
to
him
in
this
case.
but
let
me
return
to
my
first
and
most
important
point.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
series
of
cases,
the
nature
and
extent
of
a
creditor
security
interest
in
the
property
of
bankrupt
is
the
matter
of
state
and
not
federal
law.
congress
presumably
could
make
it
otherwise
in
its
exercise
of
its
powers
under
the
bankruptcy
clause,
but
it
has
not
done
so.
in
this
respect
it
has
chosen
to
differ
to
state
law.
under
north
carolina
law,
if
petitioner
wished
to
reach
the
rents
of
the
property
by
virtue
of
his
security
interest
he
would
have
to
go
to
court
and
request
that
a
receiver
be
appointed
for
that
purpose.
such
a
remedy
is
provided
in
north
carolina
law
as
a
part
of
a
foreclosure
action.
as
i
say
we
recognize
that
in
this
case
that
precise
step
was
not
open
to
him,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
by
that
fact
he
could
vindicate
his
claim
by
doing
nothing.
that
is
essentially
what
he
is
arguing
here.
he
is
saying
since
i
could
not
go
to
state
court
i
ought
to
have
the
rents
as
a
matter
of
equity.
we
believe
that
if
he
wished
to
reach
the
rents
that
he
was
obliged
to
take
some
action
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
as
far
as
what
the
north
carolina
law
is
before
i
leave
that,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
need
for
this
court
to
resolve
conflicting
views
of
what
the
law
is
in
north
carolina
because
the
petitioner
has
said
that
the
parker
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
is
the
best
case
on
what
the
north
carolina
law
is.
we
agree
with
that
and
we
think
that
parker
case
states
the
law
quite
succinctly
and
i
would
think
that
if
the
court
refers
to
that
case,
it
will
have
all
the
north
carolina
law
needs
to
decide
this
case.
that
the
my
opponent
did
not
quote
the
whole
holding
of
that
case
and
i
will
only
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
parker
case
says
“ordinarily
a
mortgagee
or
a
creditor
secured
by
a
deed
of
trust
has
no
right
to
collect
the
rents
or
other
income
from
property
even
after
default
in
the
payment
of
secured
indebtedness.
this
right
arises
only
after
the
mortgagee
or
trusty
has
taken
possession
of
the
property
conveyed
by
consent
or
pursuant
to
an
order
or
decree
of
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
but
where
as
in
the
instant
case
says
the
court
a
receiver
appointed
by
the
court
in
a
foreclosure
action
has
taken
possession
of
the
property
and
collected
the
rents,
then
the
rents
should
be
applied
as
payment
on
the
secured
indebtedness.”
and
we
have
no
problem
with
that
holding
at
all.
what
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
in
this
case
no
mr.
justice
steven
it
does
not
and
the
reason
it
does
not
is
because
that
request
was
made
during
the
arrangement
proceedings
of
the
case.
in
the
first
place
i
would
not
agree
that
it
was
a
receiver.
it
was
not
a
receiver.
it
was
an
agent
that
was
appointed
but
even
assuming
that
it
was
a
receiver,
rule
201
of
the
bankruptcy
rules
provides
that
when
a
trustee
is
appointed
in
a
liquidating
bankruptcy
the
receivership
is
terminated.
so
even
if
there
was
a
receiver
appointed
during
the
chapter
xi
phase
of
that
case
that
phase
was
ended
and
that
receivership
was
terminated
by
the
appointment
actually
by
the
qualification
of
the
trustee.
not
only
that,
but
the
trustee
and
this
is
why
this
is
a
matter
of
substance
and
not
simply
form,
the
trustee
received
completely
separate
and
distinct
set
of
marching
orders
from
that
had
been
applied
to
this
agent
or
receiver
or
whatever
he
is
called
because
the
agent
or
receiver
was
told
to
pay,
to
apply
the
rents
in
a
certain
specified
priority;
taxes,
fire
insurance
so
on
and
so
forth
with
the
second
mortgagee
on
the
bottom
of
the
list.
the
trustee
on
the
other
hand
was
told
not
to
pay
any
expenses,
but
to
simply
accumulate
the
rents
produced
by
the
property
until
further
order
of
the
court.
so
by
reason
first
of
all
of
rule
201
of
the
bankruptcy
rules
and
secondly
by
the
fact
that
the
trustee
was
given
a
totally
different
set
of
instructions
from
that
received
by
the
receiver
in
this
case
we
say
that
action
was
simply
insufficient
to
govern
the
rents
from
the
time
of
bankruptcy
until
the
time
that
the
mortgagee
took
possession.
that's
the
time
period
we
are
looking
at
this
case,
it
opens
with
the
adjudication
of
the
bankruptcy,
it
closes
when
the.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
it
would
depend
on
what
the
effect
of
a
adjudication
of
bankruptcy
is
on
a
state
court
receivership,
if
as
i
think
it
would
terminate
that
receivership
then
the
result
would
be
exactly
the
same
and
my
argument
would
be
exactly
the
same.
in
other
words
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no,
it
would
not
retroactively
extinguish
it.
as
i
say
we
are
talking
about
the
period
of
time
in
this
case
beginning
with
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy.
in
other
words
the
mortgage
was
not
in
default
prior
to
the
appointment
of
the
receiver.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
second
mortgagee,
the
petitioner
received
all
these
rents
during
that
period
of
time.
he
is
not
asking
for
that
now.
he
has
already
got
them.
he
is
asking
for
the
rents
that
accrued
starting
with
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy,
starting
with
the
time
the
trustee
was
told
pay
no
more
rents.
now
since
that
day
no
more
mortgage
has
been
paid
and
that's
what
petitioner
is
asking
for.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
there
are
two
things
i
think
that
the
petitioner
could
have
done
in
the
bankruptcy
court
which
we
think
that
he
should
have
done.
rule
701
provides
for
adversary
proceedings
“to
determine
the
validity,
priority
or
extent
of
a
lien
or
other
interest
in
property.”
petitioner
could
have
filed
an
adversary
proceeding
claiming
that
his
mortgage
extended
to
an
interest
in
the
rents.
under
rule
765
of
the
bankruptcy
rules
which
adopts
rule
65
of
the
federal
rules,
the
court
could
have
ordered
the
trustee
not
to
commit
the
funds
pending
an
adjudication
although
in
fact
this
is
what
the
bankruptcy
court
had
told
the
trustee
anyway.
and
then
if
petitioner
had
prevailed
in
this
adversary
proceeding
the
bankruptcy
court
could
have
entered
an
order
of
sequestration
or
attachment,
telling
the
trustee
to
pay
the
rents
over
to
the
mortgagee
or
as
a
second
course
of
action
the
petitioner
could
have
gone
in
under
rule
601
(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
rules
and
ask
for
relief
from
the
stay
of
state
court
proceedings
which
rule
601
imposes.
the
rule
601
says
you
will
not
enforce
any
action
against
the
property
in
a
state
court,
but
there
is
a
provision,
section
c
of
that
rule,
that
says
on
application
of
any
party
or
any
creditor
the
state
bankruptcy
court
may
lift
the
stay
and
permit
the
creditor
to
go
to
state
court.
so
he
could
have
done
either
one
of
those
two
things.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
feudal
or
a
ceremonial
gesture.
we
are
asking
for
very
real
and
substantive
compliance
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
there
was
no
such
provision.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
there
is
that
question
as
to
whether
he
is
in
fact
entitled
to
them
would
be
decided
under
state
law.
if
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
it
is
a
clause
that
is
valid
under
state
law
then
i
would
think
that
absence
some
supervening
reason
for
order
whatever
that
it
would
be
enforced
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well
it
may
be
and
that
certainly
is
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
the
government's
position
is
that
it
would
have
to
be
determined
under
state
law.
now
if
you
assume
that
state
law
would
give
affect
to
that
provision
and
give
the
rents
to
the
mortgagee
then
that's
our
position
that
it
would
be
done.
that's
the
fidelity
banker's
case,
judge
haynsworth's
opinion.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
it
has
be
made
in
the
--
when
the
mortgage
is
drafted.
it
has
to
be
included
in
the
mortgage.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
think
that,
that
if
the
claim
is
made
after
bankruptcy
begins
that
the
bankruptcy
court
would
have
to
give
effect
to
that
insofar
as
the
state
law
would.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
not
say
it
in
the
chapter
xi.
i
would
say
again
here
only
under
-
-
only
under
state
law.
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
that
we
are
asking
that
the
court
require
the
petitioner
to
take
some
action.
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
the
scheme
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
it
is
not
the
intend
of
congress
to
give
the
creditor
any
enhancement
of
the
remedies
he
otherwise
would
have
merely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
his
debtor
is
in
bankruptcy
court.
he
could
not
reach
these
rents
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
action
namely
appointment
of
a
receiver
in
state
court.
he
should
not
be
able
to
do
so
in
federal
court
absent
at
comparable
action.
the
second
reason
and
one
that
i
think
is
most
important
here
is
that
the
petitioner's
acts
in
this
case
or
lack
of
acts
have
really
disrupted
the
orderly
administration
of
this
bankruptcy
because
the
first
time
that
petitioner
ever
came
in
and
said
i
have
a
right
to
these
rents
was
after
the
property
had
been
sold,
after
his
proof
of
claim
had
been
submitted,
in
fact
in
his
proof
of
claim
he
specifically
disclaimed
any
interest
in
these
rents.
what
he
said
was
i
have
no
interest
other
than
“that
in
the
note
and
deed
of
trust.”
neither
of
those
documents
said
anything
about
security
interest
in
rents.
so
he
presented
this
to
the
trustee
and
said
here
is
my
proof
of
claim.
the
trustee
looked
at
it
and
said
fine
and
acted
on
that
basis
and
then
some
six
months
afterwards
he
comes
back
in
and
says,
well
i
also
have
a
proof,
i
also
have
a
claim
on
the
primary
source
of
income
from
this
estate.
that
is
simply
confounding
the
trustee
and
will
continue
to
confound
the
trustee
in
future
cases
if
that
is
the
result
that
is
allowed
here.
i
will
yield
the
remaining
time
of
my
argument
to
mr.
cagle.
