mr.
j.
steven
brackett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
as
a
controversy
between
a
mortgagee
and
the
bankrupt
estate
as
to
whether
or
not
the
mortgagee
of
the
bankrupt
estate
was
entitled
to
rent
realized
for
mortgaged
property
between
the
time
of
the
mortgagor's
bankruptcy
and
the
sale
of
this
property
pursuant
to
an
order
of
bankruptcy
court.
i
think
it's
necessary
preliminarily
that
we
discuss
some
of
the
facts
in
this
case
as
i
relate
to
the
north
carolina
law
and
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
i
would
like
to
discuss
these
facts
in
detail.
this
case
began
as
a
chapter
xi
proceeding,
that
is
a
plan
of
arrangement
under
the
bankruptcy
act
wherein
the
bankrupt
estate
in
this
case
owned
tracts
of
real
estate
as
well
as
personal
property
which
was
sold
as
merchandise
in
a
retail
business.
only
at
real
estate
owned
by
the
bankrupt
estate
there
existed
a
first
deed
of
trust
and
also
a
second
deed
of
trust.
during
the
period
of
arrangement
after
the
commitment
of
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
work
was
done
and
performed
at
the
instruction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
by
various
attorneys,
certified
public
accountants
and
others.
there
was
about
$800,000
worth
of
personal
property
which
was
inventory
of
the
bankrupt
estate
which
was
disposed
off
during
this
period
of
arrangement.
no
proceeds
were
deducted
from
the
sale
of
this
personal
property
in
inventory
to
be
applied
to
at
the
cost
of
administrating
a
bankruptcy
estate
or
as
payments
for
any
of
the
attorneys,
accountants
and
various
other
employees
engaged
by
the
bankrupt
estate.
during
the
period
of
bankruptcy
some
one
year
after
the
bankruptcy
had
been
initiated,
the
second
holders
of
deeds
of
trust
in
the
property
perceived
that
the
bankrupt
estate
under
its
plan
for
arrangement
was
not
able
to
keep
current
the
first
deeds
of
trust
or
the
first
security
on
the
real
estate.
therefore,
these
first
and
second
mortgage
holders
through
the
bankrupt
debtors
attorney
sought
the
appointment
of
a
receiver
who
was
to
receive
and
collect
all
income
produced
by
the
estate
that
is
the
rental
income
from
the
real
estate
and
apply
that
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
federal
and
state
income
taxes,
to
the
monthly
mortgage
payments
due
to
the
first
mortgagors,
to
the
ad
valorem
taxes,
the
payment
of
fire
insurance
and
to
the
interest
and
principal
payments
due
to
the
second
mortgage
holders.
there
was
also
within
a
period
of
a
few
months
later
a
standby
trustee
appointed.
this
stand
by
trustee
is
the
trustee
defendant
in
this
case.
also,
at
the
time
this
receiver
was
appointed
for
the
collection
of
the
rents,
the
bankruptcy
court
specifically
ordered
that
the
second
secured
parties
in
the
real
estate
not
attempt
in
any
way
to
petition
or
foreclose
their
property
in
the
state
courts
without
the
specific
permission
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
this
of
course
was
in
addition
to
the
general
stay
order
that
is
executed
against
the
creditors
when
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
initiated.
because
of
default
by
several
of
the
bankrupt
--
the
debtor
in
possessions
creditors
that
is
several
tenants
on
their
real
estate
and
the
mortgage
--
in
the
rental
payments,
the
tenant
and
other
financial
reversals
there
was
not
sufficient
cash
flow
being
generated
by
the
debtor
in
possession
to
comply
with
the
bankruptcy,
with
the
bankruptcy
judge's
order
regarding
payment
of
the
various
four
payments
that
i
previously
mentioned
to
the
court.
therefore,
this
petitioner
who
is
here
before
you
today
filed
an
application
with
the
bankruptcy
court
on
the
30th
day
of
december
1974
to
have
one
of
three
acts
performed
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
that
is
to
convert
the
chapter
xi
proceeding,
that
is
the
plan
of
arrangement
to
a
liquidating
bankruptcy.
two;
to
remove
the
stay
outstanding
against
these
second
deeds
of
trust
holders
in
order
that
they
can
pursue
their
state
remedies
under
the
state
law
of
north
carolina
or
three
to
convert
the
proceeding
from
a
chapter
xi
to
a
chapter
x
proceeding
under
the
bankruptcy
rules.
at
this
time,
the
second
deeds
of
trust
outstanding
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case
were
not
in
default.
they
were
paid
current.
on
the
14th
day
of
february,
1975,
the
bankrupt,
that
is
the
debtor
possession
was
adjudged
to
be
a
bankrupt
was
adjudged
bankrupt.
a
trustee
was
appointed
that
is
the
trustee
who
is
defendant
in
this
case,
was
appointed
to
proceed
with
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
he
was
ordered
in
that
--
in
his
order
--
in
the
order
appointing
him
as
trustee
to
collect
and
receive
all
rents,
issue,
income
and
profits
and
to
hold
and
retain
all
moneys
and
profits
received
to
the
end
that
the
same
may
be
applied
under
this
or
different
or
further
orders
of
the
court.
on
april
the
16th
of
1975
some
two
months
after
the
trustees'
appointment,
there
was
a
first
meeting
of
creditors.
it
was
suggested
that
at
this
time
by
the
trustee
as
well
as
your
petitioner
in
this
case,
who
was
a
second
mortgage
holder
that
there
was
no
equity
in
the
property
and
that
the
property
should
be
conveyed,
not
abandoned,
but
conveyed
to
the
second
mortgage
holders
in
order
that
they
could
workout
arrangements
with
their
first
security
holders
under
the
real
estate.
at
this
time,
the
bankruptcy
court
in
its
hearing
as
documented
in
the
appendix
in
this
record
suggested
that
there
were
substantial
amount
of
administration
cost
of
bankruptcy
which
had
accrued
during
the
period
of
the
arrangement
and
was
curious
as
to
what
source
would
produce
the
moneys
to
satisfy
these
costs
of
administration
and
indicated
also
that
the
economic
conditions
were
bad
at
that
time
and
perhaps
that
would
improve
within
the
next
several
months
and
indicated
therefore
to
the
second
mortgage
holder
and
to
the
trustee
that
he
was
not
inclined
to
convey
the
property
to
the
second
secured
parties
in
the
real
estate.
thereafter,
the
property
was
sold
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
bankruptcy
judge
late
in
july
of
that
year.
at
the
time
of
the
sale
which
was
a
public
sale
after
due
notice
there
was
a
substantial
deficiency
that
is
in
about
and
sum
of
approximately
$213,400,
that
is
that
the
second
deeds
of
trust
holders
were
without
their
security
to
that
extent.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
again
approached
the
bankruptcy
court,
moved
that
the
bankruptcy
court
not
confirm
the
sale
and
that
they
abandoned
the
property
to
the
bank
--
to
the
second
secured
holders.
the
bankruptcy
court
declined
this.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
appealed
to
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
remanded
to
the
bankruptcy
court
with
the
instruction
that
the
bankruptcy
court
order
the
property
sold
again
with
the
petitioners
that
is
the
second
mortgage
holders
being
allowed
to
use
the
credit
due
them
on
their
deeds
of
trust
to
the
extent
of
$360,000.
under
these
conditions
your
petitioner
in
this
case
purchased
the
property
having
a
deficiency
owned
under
his
debt
of
$186,000.
thereafter
the
trustee
in
this
case
drew
a
deed
conveying
all
four
tracts
of
property
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
trustee
also
had
that
deed
recorded
and
delivered
it
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
soon
after
the
petitioner
made
claim
for
disbursement
of
the
funds
on
hand,
some
$160,000
plus
accrued
interest
which
were
collected
by
the
trustee
as
a
rental
on
the
property
it
which
had
said
the
petitioner
held
a
security
interest.
the
bankruptcy
judge
held
a
hearing
regarding
this
and
found
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
an
unsecured
creditor
to
the
extent
of
$186,000.
and
this
ruling,
petitioner
appealed
to
the
district
court
and
district
court
reversed
the
finding
of
the
bankruptcy
judge.
this
order
was
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
order
determining
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
not
complied
with
the
state
law
of
north
carolina
in
seeking
to
sequester
and
have
these
rentals
set
aside
and
help
for
his
benefit
and
therefore
declaring
him
to
be
an
unsecured
creditor.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
your
honor,
we
felt
like
that
was
probably
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
why
we
are
here
on
this
case.
i
don't
--
in
my
opinion
i
don't
see
the
bearing
of
passages
of
the
new
bankruptcy
act
on
this
case
other
than
perhaps
paragraph
57
(h),
which
has
been
cited
by
the
government
in
their
brief
here.
that
might
have
some
bearing
and
also
i
think
we
need
to
have
a
resolution
of
the
diversion
between
the
circuits
here
in
order
that
the
secured
creditors
can
know
what
their
standing
is
and
what
is
going
to
be
required
of
them
to
protect
their
interest
when
their
moneys
are
in
the
hands
of
a
trustee.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
to
that
extent
again
reiterate
to
his
honor
that
to
the
extent
of
the
new
bankruptcy
act,
we
are
not
that
familiar
with
the
proposed
new
bankruptcy
act
to
the
extent
that
this
effects
or
the
new
draft
of
the
bankruptcy
act
would
affect
the
rights
of
secured
debtors
then
yes,
this
case
is
of
extreme
importance
to
the
drafters
in
new
bankruptcy
act
to
this
court
in
considering
this
case.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
the
split
of
the
cases.
i
think
it's
a
perception
of
the
various
circuits
as
to
what
bankruptcy
is.
apparently
the
third
and
seventh
circuits
perceived
bankruptcy
to
be
an
equitable
remedy
and
therefore
the
third
and
seventh
circuits
tend
to
apply
equitable
principles.
the
remaining,
the
second,
eighth
and
ninth
circuit,
i
think
if
the
circuits
are
involved
here
in
these
particular
cases
follow
the
principle
that
so
far
a
state
law
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
federal
bankruptcy
law,
they
are
going
to
apply
the
state
law
in
recognition
of
the
secured
creditors
rights
only
being
consistent
with
those
product
real
estate
that
is
located
in
their
states.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
think
we
have
--
they
have
disregarded
that
principle
in
any
case
to
apply
a
so
called
federal
rule.
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
have
adhered
to
that
principle.
that
has
been
a
consideration
in
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
skillful
drafting
of
the
mortgage
agreement
would
be
the
first
step
that
mortgagor
would
have
him
protect
himself,
yes.
as
i
have
attempted
to
point
out
to
the
court,
there
is
a
split
among
the
circuits
and
that
the
circuits
that
follow
the
so
called
equitable
rule
would
be
the
third
and
seventh
circuits.
this
case
was
the
case,
the
principle
case
set
out
there
as
the
bindseil
v.
liberty
trust
co.
this
case
says
that
in
essence
that
bankruptcy
interferes
with
state
remedies
to
such
an
extent
that
a
debtor
or
a
creditor
is
prohibited
from
exercising
certain
rights
that
he
might
have
under
state
law
and
in
cases
such
as
this
where
equitable
principles
would
allow
the
bankruptcy
court
will
allow
his
lien
to
the
extent
that
it
is
deficiency
to
follow
the
rentals
that
are
turned
over
to
the
hands
of
a
trustee.
the
remaining
circuits,
that
is
the
second
eighth
and
ninth
circuits
adhere
to
the
rule
that
they
will
follow
the
state
law
and
that
law
is
to
be
applied
carefully.
under
either
comprehension
of
the
law,
we
suggest
that
the
petitioner
has
complied
with
under
the
diversion
of
both
circuits
and
in
any
event
in
this
case
the
petitioner
should
be
granted
a
security
interest
in
these
rents
and
the
primary
basis
for
this
is
the
cases
parker
co.
versus
commercial
bank
of
high
point.
this
is
cited
in
204
north
carolina
432.
we
contend
this
is
the
law
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
that
the
fourth
circuit
failed
to
properly
address
itself
to
this
case
in
determining
that
the
bank
or
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
not
complied
with
the
state
law.
in
the
parker
case,
there
was
a
judgment
creditor
that
is
a
creditor
who
had
pursued
his
remedy
to
a
judgment,
it
was
outstanding
mortgage
held
by
a
first
deed
of
trust
against
an
automobile
company
or
motor
company.
the
mortgagor
under
the
deed
of
trust
began,
initiated
a
foreclosure
proceeding.
the
judge
macdader
(ph)
in
that
case
filed
an
action
to
enjoin
the
foreclosure
proceeding.
rents
were
accumulated
while
this
action
was
pending
in
the
courts
of
north
carolina.
subsequently
the
mortgage
holder
obtained
a
deficiency
judgment
and
reduced
it
to
judgment.
the
judge
macdader
(ph)
who
had
initiated
the
action
to
enjoin
the
foreclosure
had
had
a
receiver
appointed
who
collected
these
rents.
the
court
held
that
the
mortgage
creditor
was
entitled
to
satisfy
his
deficiency
judgment
from
the
funds
collected
by
the
receiver
during
the
pendency
of
the
action.
we
contend
that
this
case
is
directly
analogous
to
the
case
before
the
court
here.
the
opposition
would
contend
that
we
have
failed
to
take
steps
as
required
in
the
north
carolina
state
law
to
protect
ourselves.
citing
the
case
of
greg
versus
williams
which
places
north
carolina
in
alignment
with
the
majority
of
states
in
this
country
that
require
that
a
mortgagee
in
order
to
assert
a
security
interest
in
the
real
estate,
in
the
rentals
collected,
take
some
into
which
substitutes
for
taking
possession
of
the
property.
that
is
ordinarily
the
mortgagee
would
have
to
take
possession
of
the
property
and
these
courts
have
held
that
where
taking
of
the
property
is
not
possible
as
in
a
bankruptcy
case,
the
mortgagee
must
take
some
other
action
to
perfect
his
security
interest.
that
is
he
must
seek
to
have
the
rental
sequester
or
seek
to
have
a
receiver
appointed
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
in
this
case
--
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
no
sir,
we
did
not.
it
was
cited
by
the
government
and
we
think
it
was
favorable
to
our
position.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
williams
and
line
of
cases
cited
by
the
government
and
it's
the
best
case
we
contend
on
this
--
what
the
standing
what
the
requirements
of
north
carolina
law
are.
as
to
whether
or
not
we
have
done
the
things
necessary
or
required
by
north
carolina
law
we
contend
that
we
have
and
that's
the
factual
issue
that
was
addressed
in
the
dissent
in
the
fourth
circuit
by
judge
brown.
our
opponents
in
this
case
would
have
a
court
rule
that
actions
taken
by
the
petitioner
during
the
plan
of
arrangement
were
not
taken
during
bankruptcy.
we
have
of
course
have
cited
in
our
brief
that
proper
–
the
applicable
bankruptcy
rules
which
say
of
course
that
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
so
holding
that
actions
taking
during
the
plan
of
arrangement
are
of
course
equivalent
to
those
actions
which
are
taken
after
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy.
we
say
that
the
real
crux
of
this
case
as
it
relates
to
the
petitioner
is
that
he
had
a
receiver
appointed
by
making
request
of
the
attorney
for
the
debtor.
our
opponents
would
argue
to
the
court
that
because
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
actually
filed
the
motion
that
the
petitioner
should
not
be
allowed
to
benefit
from
that.
i
asked
the
court
to
address
themselves
in
particular
to
that
application
which
recites
the
fact
that
the
secured
creditors
had
approached
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
and
requested
this
and
the
reasons
therefore.
subsequently
in
the
chapter

j.
steven
brackett

brackett
it's
a
complicated
set
of
facts.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
no
sir.
what
the
document
is
to
be
found
in
the
record,bear
with
me
for
just
a
moment,
at
204
a
in
the
appendix.
this
was
a
petition
by
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
and
it
recites
in
the
petition
that
the
petition
was
made
because
of
the
request
of
the
secured
creditor.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
north
carolina
requires
that
you
take
possession,
that
the
mortgagee
take
possession
or
otherwise
seek
to
protect
himself
by
having
a
receiver
appointed.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
no
sir,
we
contend
what
we
did
here
was
address
the
attorney
for
the
debtor,
ask
him
to
have
a
receiver
appointed
and
that
the
receiver's
instructions
from
the
bankruptcy
court
were
to
collect
the
rents
and
then
they
established
a
priority
as
to
how
those
rents
would
be
disposed
off.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
your
honor,
if
you
look
two
pages
before
that
in
record,
i
believe
at
202.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
no,
sir.
your
honor
shall
be,
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
court,
again
this
is
a
complicated
fact
situation.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir,
there
are
four,
there
were
four
tracts
of
line,
four
different
institutions
held
first
deeds
of
trust
on
those
properties.
the
petitioner
held
a
so
called
blanket
deed
of
trust
which
was
secured
by
all
four
tracts
of
property,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
it
might
be
important
to
note
and
i
think
the
record
again
--
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
no
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
i
think
the
request
is
to
be
taken
in
context
with
order
and
request
was
--
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir,
to
the
extent
that's
the
as
a
court,
as
a
court
can
see
from
the
order,
they
were
four
priorities
set
up
and
the
unsecured
creditors
were
not
part
of
the
priorities
ordered
by
the
bankruptcy
court
at
all.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir,
he
was
required
under
the
order
to
collect
the
rents,
to
sequester
those
to
keep
proper
ledger
cards
and
then
to
apply
them
in
accordance
with
order
of
the
bankruptcy
judge.
we
say
that
was
a
sufficient
action
on
our
part
to
comply
with
north
carolina's
requirements
and
receiver
be
appointed.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
then
that
it
would
my
contention
that
would
accumulate
until
the
conclusion
in
the
bankruptcy
and
that
may
be
dispersed.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
no
sir,
as
i
stated
to
the
court
in
trying
to
recite
to
facts
in
this
case
what
brought
about
this
request
for
receiver
was
the
fact
that
the
bankrupt
debtor
in
possession
was
not
able
from
the
cash
flow
to
keep
the
mortgage
payments
current.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
no
sir,
that's
another
significant
fact.
this
occurred
during
the
plan
of
arrangement,
when
the
second
creditors
perceived
that
their
security
was
in
peril,
they
requested
that
a
receiver
be
appointed.
this
would
say
--
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir
we
did.
the
court
would
say
--
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yeah,
sir
we
did.
if
the
court
would
review
the
record,
the
court
will
find
in
addition
to
the
appointment
of
receiver
that
on
december
the
30th
of
1974
and
there
is
a
petition
application
filed
by
petitioner
in
this
case
to
have
three
things
done
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
that
is
to
convert
it
to
a
straight
bankruptcy
to
allow
the
second
secured
creditors
to
be
allowed
pursue
their
state
remedies
or
to
convert
it
to
a
chapter
x
proceeding
under
the
bankruptcy
laws,
so
those
things
were
done.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
in
this
case
--
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
in
this
case
if
there
is
no
equity
in
the
property
for
the
general
creditors
or
beyond
his
own,
he
ask
that
the
property
be
abandoned.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
there
was
a
petition
for
abandonment
filed,
there
was
also
an
oral
request
made
at
hearing
which
is
the
transcript
of
hearings
and
opinions
and
the
bankruptcy
court
at
that
time
indicated
and
i
think
this
is
an
overwhelmingly
significant
fact
that
there
were
not
sufficient
funds
on
hand
to
pay
the
cost
of
administering
the
arrangement
proceeding.
there
were
not
sufficient
moneys
to
do
that,
even
though
$800,000
worth
of
inventory
had
been
sold.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
we
contend
that
where
you
have
a
--
where
there
is
a
secured
creditor
who
didn't
realize
the
full
extent
of
his
debt
that
the
priorities
for
the
rents
generated
by
the
real
estate
lies
with
the
secured
creditor
on
the
deficiency
of
his
debt.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
in
my
opinion
that
was
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
bankruptcy
judge.
he
issued
--
what
they
did
--
what
he
did
in
doing
following
this
procedure
is
he
kept
a
security
of
a
secured
creditor
away
from
hand
in
an
attempt
to
generate
funds
to
cover
the
cost
of
administering
a
bankruptcy
procedure.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
no,
sir
he
would
not,
he
would
not
and
it
is
particularly
significant
that
the
fact
of
the
bankruptcy
court
had
approved
and
confirmed
the
sale
of
a
tremendous
amount
of
retail
sales
inventory
without
taxing
that
property
and
the
funds
derived
from
that
property
with
any
cost
of
the
administration.
i
think
it's
very
significant
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
disagree
as
to
what
north
carolina
law
is.
i
am
asking
this
court
to
examine
carefully
the
parker
case
and
find
that
to
be
the
law
in
north
carolina
and
find
that
to
be
a
case
on
all
force
with
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
i
think
there
was
a
misapprehension
of
law
in
north
carolina.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
judge
jones,
our
preceding
district
court
judge
is
an
experienced
attorney
in
north
carolina.
i
contend
his
perception
of
law
in
north
carolina
was
more
clear
than
that
of
the
fourth
circuit
with
all
due
respect
and
discretion
that
spots
on.
i
think
judge
brain's
opinion
and
i
ask
the
court
to
take
particular
note
of
it,
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case
from
the
fourth
circuit
is
very
perceptive
as
to
the
whether
or
not
this
was
done
during
bankruptcy
or
not
during
bankruptcy
and
that
seems
to
be
the
fulcrum
that
the
fourth
circuit
swung
on
as
well
or
not
this
was
done
during
bankruptcy
or
not
bank
during
bankruptcy
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
actions
taken
during
plan
of
arrangements
were
during
bankruptcy.
i
only
have
a
brief
minute
with
court
so
with
the
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
your
honor,
if
i
could
have
just
few
more
moments
i
want
to
address
my
self
to
--
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
two
more
minutes,
yes
sir.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
questions
that
is
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
he
brought
to
the
court's
attention
that
this
affidavit
which
takes
up
a
substantial
part
for
perhaps
two-thirds
on
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
and
their
argument
regarding
equity
in
the
property
was
filed
on
november
the
11.
it
was
prepared
and
signed
by
the
trustee
on
november
the
11
and
the
decision
of
the
district
court
judge
was
on
november
the
12.
i
had
frankly
do
not
think
that
was
even
considered
by
the
district
court
judge
and
it
is
a
hindsight
look
at
what
happened
after
the
petitioner
got
the
property
and
we
argue
and
contend
it
should
not
be
considered
in
any
decision
of
this
court.
secondly,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
equity
in
this
property.
if
that
is
consideration
in
the
court,
it's
clear
that
there
was
no
equity.
at
the
first
sale
even
according
to
the
government's
figures,
the
deficiency
on
the
petitioner's
debt
was
substantially
more
than
at
the
second
sale.
now
the
trustee
would
argue
that
the
fact
that
there
was
a
bankruptcy
order
involved
with
that
allowing
the
petitioner
to
bid
in
his
second
deed
of
trust,
chilled
a
competitive
bidding.
in
fact,
the
sale
brought
more
money
at
the
second
sale
than
it
did
at
the
first
sale.
there
was
clearly
no
equity
in
this
case.
i
ask
that
the
court
to
look
at
the
first
meeting
of
creditors
in
the
appendix
where
the
trustee
who
is
argued
to
this
court
today
stated
that
there
was
no
--
in
his
opinion
there
was
no
equity
and
a
property
and
that
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
equity
in
the
property
as
in
december.
the
particular
arguments
i
want
to
address
myself,
my
attention
to
the
court
is
that
set
out
on
--
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir,
pardon
me
your
honor.
i
like
to
reiterate
justice
brian's
dissent
in
the
fourth
circuit
regarding
continuation
of
whether
it
was
during
or
after
bankruptcy.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
i
think
that
it
would
have
extinguished
the
second
mortgage.
mr.
j.
steven
brackett
yes
sir.
