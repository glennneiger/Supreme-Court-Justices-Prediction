justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
interrupt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
relying
on
the
parker
case
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
cite
that
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh
i
see.
thanks,
alright,
the
government
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
brackett,
just
a
second
to
follow
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
rather
complicated
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
questions
on
that.
first,
where
in
the
record
is
the
document
you
just
described
and
secondly
in
that
document
did
they
request
an
assignment
of
the
rent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
call
our
attention
to
in
the
record
is
the
order
appointing
the
trustee
or
whatever
he
is
to
act
for
court
and
that
order
recites
that
the
motion
was
made
by
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
and
you
are
telling
us
that
motion
was
made
by
attorney
for
the
debtor
because
you
requested
him
to
do
so.
where
is
your
request
to
him
to
do
so
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
several
parties
shall
be
savings,
they
all
the
same
second
mortgagees
at
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
is
acadia
(ph)
case
as
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
point
is
that
the
second
mortgagee
or
second
deed
of
trust
holders
requested
this
procedure
and
that
the
first
land
holders
would
be
taking
care
of
and
first
(inaudible)
would
be
paid
to
your
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ryan,
why
isn't
that
happened
here?
in
that
order
he
calls
our
attention
to
that
this
order
at
204
of
the
record
that
he
requested
that
a
representative
of
the
court
be
appointed
to
collect
the
rents.
isn't
that
â€“
doesn't
that
fall
within
that
language
you
just
read?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
instead
of
there
being
a
chapter
xi
arrangement
before
the
bankruptcy
there
had
been
a
state
code
receivership
and
pursuant
to
a
petition
by
the
second
mortgagee
a
state
court
had
entered
an
order
verbatim
the
same
as
the
one
204
a,
would
that
not
have
entitled
to
second
mortgagee
to
the
rents
for
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
as
a
matter
of
state
law
up
to
the
time
of
adjudication
of
bankruptcy
the
ownership
of
the
rents
had
been
in
the
second
mortgagee,
it
would
retroactively
extinguish
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh!
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh!
i
see,
he
is
talking
about
--
he
is
relying
on
an
order
that
was
entered
before
there
was
any
default
on
the
second
mortgage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
order
was
complied
with
and
you
have
a
new
ball
game
at
the
time
of
the
adjudication.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
am
sorry,
you
can
go
ahead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cagle,
how
could
you
say
that
the
record
show
there
was
a
huge
equity
in
the
property
at
the
time
of
the
sale.
he
bought
it
for
about
half
of
the
second
mortgage
indebtedness
as
i
remember
at
the
time
of
the
sale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
then
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
substantial
equity
in
the
property
over
and
above.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
we
have
to
look
at
it
at
the
time
of
the
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
are
looking
at
it
as
the
benefit
of
hindsight
when
you
say
that
later
on,
it
turned
out
that
the
property
increased
in
value
and
the
petitioner
made
a
profit
out
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
had
a
lien,
a
second
mortgage
lien
for
about
three
hundred
and
some
thousand
dollars
and
he
bought
the
property
for
170
or
something
like
that,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
didn't
have
to
use
it
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
tell
me
one
of
the
thing
about
the
abandonment
because
i
just
really
didn't
understand.
had
there
been
abandonment
at
that
particular
time,
would
that
have
extinguished
entirely
the
second
mortgage
indebtedness
or
would
there
then
have
still
had
been
some
kind
of
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that
what
would
have
happened
if
there
has
been
an
abandonment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out
is
had
been
there
abandonment
at
that
time,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
the
abandonment
have
been
on
the
second
mortgage
indebtedness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
he
would
have
taken
over
the
property,
he
would
become
the
owner
of
the
property
and
still
retained
this
entire
$360,000
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
take
five
seconds
to
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
has
been
abandonment
what
would
that
have
done
to
the
second
mortgage
indebtedness
when
you
requested
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
entirely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
petitioner
in
this
case
held
a
mortgage
in
north
carolina
real
estate
owned
by
a
corporation
that
became
bankrupt.
rent
was
collected
after
the
bankruptcy
and
before
the
property
was
sold.
petitioner
claims
that
he
is
entitled
to
that
rent
whereas
the
trustee
and
bankruptcy
claims
it
should
be
used
to
pay
general
creditors.
in
this
situation,
some
state
courts
hold
that
the
rent
is
payable
to
the
holder
of
the
mortgage,
and
others
hold
that
it
should
--
it
should
be
used
to
pay
general
creditors.
there
is
also
a
conflict
among
federal
courts
on
this
question.
some
hold
that
they
will
apply
this
same
rule
that
the
state
court
would
apply
in
the
state
where
the
property
is
located.
others
hold
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
the
mortgagee
always
wins
regardless
of
what
the
state
law
may
be.
we
granted
certiorari
not
because
the
outcome
of
this
particular
case
is
a
matter
of
national
importance,
but
rather
because
it
presents
the
more
basic
and
important
question
of
how
federal
bankruptcy
courts
should
decide
questions
of
this
kind.
should
they
apply
a
federal
rule
that
is
uniform
throughout
the
united
states
or
should
they
apply
--
and
if
they
should
apply
a
federal
rule,
what
should
the
rule
be
or
should
they
apply
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
property
is
located?
for
two
principle
reasons,
the
court
has
unanimously
decided
that
state
law
should
be
followed.
first,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
not
enacted
any
statute
governing
this
question
and
therefore,
there
is
no
federal
rule
that
can
be
easily
applied.
second,
it
is
primarily
the
responsibility
of
the
state
governments
rather
than
the
federal
governments
to
fashion
rules
of
property
law.
and
therefore,
even
though
this
case
arises
out
of
a
federal
bankruptcy
proceeding,
we
hold
that
the
law
of
north
carolina
should
be
applied
for
--
essentially,
these
reasons
which
are
stated
in
more
detail
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
yesterday,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
is
affirmed.
