mr.
brackett,
let
me
interrupt
you
at
this
point.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
have
any
comment
with
respect
to
the
passage
of
the
new
bankruptcy
act
and
its
bearing
on
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
it
does
have
a
bearing
it
may
make
this
case
a
lot
less
important
than
it
might
otherwise
be.
let
me
leave
just
one
provision?
the
commencement
of
a
case
creates
an
estate.
such
estate
is
comprised
of
the
following
property;
proceeds,
product,
offspring
and
rents
which
would
cut
against
you?
