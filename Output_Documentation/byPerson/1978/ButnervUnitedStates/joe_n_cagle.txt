mr.
joe
n.
cagle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
speaking
of
trustee
as
my
colleague
just
stated
it
is
important
for
the
trustee
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
creditor's
committee
and
others
interested
in
a
bankruptcy
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
what
the
liens
or
security
interests
are
on
assets
in
a
particular
bankruptcy
case
and
this
need
to
know
we
suggest
is
amply
satisfied
by
reliance
on
local
law.
the
local
law
is
the
source
that
we
contend
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
reliance
on
local
law
gives
the
debtor
creditor
relationship
emphasis
or
it
gives
them
the
knowledge
that
they
need
in
the
transactions
and
dealing
with
real
estate
and
mortgages
on
them
so
that
when
there
is
a
bankruptcy
case
everybody
knows
what
their
liens
and
what
their
status
their
rights
are
with
respect
to
certain
assets
in
the
bankrupt
estate.
everybody
in
this
particular
case
relied
upon
that
fact
that
is
that
the
local
law
was
governing
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
under
local
law,
the
petitioner
had
has
no
lien
on
the
rent.
the
petitioner
had
a
second
mortgage
on
the
real-estate
not
a
lien
on
the
rents.
bankruptcy
intervening
should
not
expand
any
of
the
rights
of
a
second
mortgagee
and
grant
to
him
any
lien
that
he
did
not
have
and
that
would
be
inconsistent.
we
suggest
that
the
bankruptcy
law,
the
bankruptcy
court
should
follow
the
jurisdiction
of
the
situs
of
the
property
and
i
do
not
believe
that
we
really
have
any
dispute
about
the
law
of
north
carolina,
greg
versus
williamson
or
the
parker
case
as
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
in
north
carolina
just
to
simply
be
redundant
if
i
will
if
you
permit
me
a
mortgagee
has
to
file
an
action
in
state
court
to
foreclose
his
mortgage.
as
a
part
of
the
foreclosure
he
can
obtain
as
an
ancillary
remedy
the
appointment
ordering
receiver.
the
law
is
that
he
must
obtain
possession,
that
is
he
must
acquire
a
deed
before
he
is
entitled
to
the
rents
under
the
law
of
north
carolina.
the
analogous
part
in
bankruptcy,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
due
process
a
mortgagee
has
remedies
available,
procedures
available
to
it
in
the
existing
bankruptcy
act
that
is
part
vii
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
rule
701
in
the
subsections
and
sections
thereafter
allows
a
trustee
or
creditor
to
institute
an
adversary
proceeding
which
is
called
a
complaint,
the
service
like
our
adversary
proceeding
before
the
court
in
north
carolina
to
foreclose
a
mortgage.
this
procedure
and
the
adversary
proceedings
allows
you
to
“recover
property
or
money,
to
determine
the
validity,
priority
or
extend
of
the
lien
or
other
interest
in
property,
to
sell
property
free
of
a
lien
or
other
interest,
to
objective
or
evoke
discharge,
to
obtain
an
injunction,
to
obtain
relief
from
a
stay
that
is
the
injunction
under
rule
401
or
406
or
to
determine
the
dischargability
of
a
debt.”
that
adversary
proceedings
section
rule
701
under
part
vii
is
the
whole
mechanical
or
procedural
set
up
in
the
bankruptcy
act
in
the
bankruptcy
courts
whereby
a
mortgagee
goes
in
the
court,
seeks
an
order
from
the
bankruptcy
court
to
allow
him
to
foreclose
on
his
mortgage
under
state
law.
we
believe
that
adversary
proceeding
section
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
a
critical
part
of
this
case,
that
is
the
method
or
the
mechanics
procedure
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
whereby
other
secured
creditors
went
into
this
bankruptcy
court
and
filed
an
action
to
recover
and
did
recover
their

mr.
joe
n.
cagle
yes
sir,
but
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
not
necessarily
sir.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
it's
an
adversary
proceeding
which
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
well,
they
should
not
take
over
30
days.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
it's
being
held
in
abeyance.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
no
sir.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
only
upon
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
administration
expense
is
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
no
sir.
file
a
petition
and
an
order.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
if
understand
your
question
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
as
a
practical
matter
i
have
not
seen
any
case
where
about
the
bankruptcy
judge
did
not
allow
a
mortgagee
to
recover
the
property
from
the
bankruptcy
jurisdiction.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
i
disagree
that
there
was
a
petition
for
abandonment,
your
honor.
even
if
the
court
abandoned
the
property
that's
not
analogous
to
the
state
court
foreclosure
proceedings
and
even
if
there
was
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
no,
no,
no
we
are
talking
about
scheme,
your
honor.
i
have
never
seen
a
case
where
the
bankruptcy
court
disallowed
under
the
rule
701
and
action
brought
to
recover
property
so
that
they
could
foreclose
their
mortgage
under
state
law.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
which
is
possible,
which
is
interesting
because
the
facts
and
figures
of
this
case
before
the
bankruptcy
judge
indicated
that
there
was
a
huge
equity
above
and
beyond
the
debt
of
the
second
mortgage.
the
abandonment,
if
the
court
had
abandoned
the
property,
that
was
not
what
the
petitioner
wanted.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
the
abandonment
would
have
required
notice
to
all
creditors
just
like
an
adversary
proceeding
before
the
court
would
have
done
that
and
there
was
no
petition
for
abandonment
filed
and
then
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
at
the
time
of
the
sale.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
no
that
was
sub
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
well,
i
don't
think
so
because
you
are
looking
at
it
in
hindsight
there.
the
time
that
the
petitioner
asked
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
i
was
saying
that
the
equity
was
there
but
reason
the
appraisals
in
december
of
1974,
just
a
few
weeks
before
it
adjudicated
in
february
75.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
at
the
second
sale
it
was
--
obviously
district
court
had
an
order
allowing
the
second
mortgagees
to
use
their
--
the
amount
of
their
second
mortgage
to
bid
at
the
sale.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
that's
correct,
that's
or
put
it
down
for
the
sale,
may
it
please
the
court,
but
the
time
that
the
petitioner
already
requested
the
court
at
the
first
meeting
of
creditors
in
april
1975
to
abandon
the
property
to
him.
that
is
not
sufficient
and
is
the
wrong
procedure,
that
was
a
request
or
suggestion
in
the
court.
that
was
not
an
adversary
proceeding
to
recover
the
property
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
bankrupt.
if
the
court
had
abandoned
the
property
he
would
still
would
have
to
file
an
adversary
proceeding
to
get
relief
from
the
stay
in
bankruptcy,
from
the
automatic
stay
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
they
would
have
to
still
had
to
go
ahead
and
just
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
okay,
the
first
mortgagees
and/or
the
second
mortgagees,
one
or
the
other
of
the
several
would
have
had
to
file
an
adversary
proceeding
to
get
permission
from
the
bankruptcy
court,
an
order
removing
the
jurisdiction
of
bankruptcy
court
from
the
property,
that
is
to
get
relief
from
the
stay
in
bankruptcy
so
that
they
could
foreclose
under
state
law.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
i
don't
see
that
there
will
be
any
effect.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
if
the
court
--
if
they
had
abandoned
the
property
the
first
mortgagees
would
have
foreclosed
under
state
law
of
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
no
sir,
none.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
no
sir.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
no
sir.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
he
would
still
would
have
had
to
foreclose
to
perfect
that
lien.
he
is
not,
yes
sir,
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
property
until
he
forecloses,
he
is
not
entitled
either
to
the
property
or
to
the
rents
had
there
been
an
assignment
of
rents
until
he
institutes
foreclosure
proceedings
and
obtains
possession
which
now
a
days
is
a
practical
matter
means
a
deed
to
him.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
but
our
possession
your
honor
please
is
that
he
can
under
the
adversary
proceedings
which
he
did
not
utilize.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
simply
an
order
not
to
foreclose
that
was
superfluous
because
the
bankruptcy
act
says
that
he
can't
foreclose.
all
he
had
to
do
even
during
the
arrangement
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
alright,
even
during
the
arrangement
people
go
in,
creditors
go
in
and
file
an
action
under
--
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
that's
correct.
mr.
joe
n.
cagle
well
there
is
no
abandonment
during
the
arrangement
period.
the
abandonment
would
have
occurred
during
the
straight
bankruptcy
or
liquidation
part
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
but
even
during
the
arrangement
what
i
wanted
to
emphasize
is
the
adversary
proceedings
section
is
available
to
all
creditors
and
in
fact
that
does
stop
a
lot
arrangements
because
one
of
the
creditors
that
are
secured,
that
is
secured,
does
not
go
along
and
he
files
an
adversary
proceeding.
we
suggest
that
the
petitioner
took
no
comparable
or
analogous
action
in
the
bankruptcy
court
under
rule
701
that
is
comparable
to
the
state
law
of
north
carolina.
we
think
that
the
local
law
is
the
law
that
should
be
followed
in
the
bankruptcy
courts
of
where
the
situs
of
the
property
is.
that's
where
by
--
should
know
what
the
law
is
and
that
is
what
we
believe
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
and
even
if
the
property
had
been
abandoned
that
does
not
automatically
give
him
title
or
give
him
a
lien
on
the
rents.
that
simply
is
not
the
north
carolina
law
and
we
suggest
that
abandonment
really
is
immaterial
and
back
up
just
a
minute
to
from
i
would
say
that
during
the
arrangement
that
was
an
agent,
a
disbursing
agent.
now
preamble
to
that,
petition
to
the
opponent
simon
joseph
golden,
as
an
agent
say
that
there
was
only
one
employee
left
and
that
there
need
to
be
somebody
there
to
disburse
the
funds,
to
collect
and
disburse
funds.
it
was
not
a
receiver
in
any
bankruptcy
sense.
thank
you,
your
honor.
