mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
respond
to
petitioner's
arguments
with
regard
to
the
constitutional
propriety
of
judicial
participation
plea
negotiations,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
what
i
perceive
to
have
been
a
misconception
not
a
misrepresentation
but
a
misconception
of
what
the
conference
part
in
kings
county
is
all
about.
conference
part
is
not
statutorily
mandated
there
is
no
provision
it
for
anywhere
in
the
new
york
criminal
procedure
law.
however
the
court
rules
enacted
by
the
various
appellate
divisions
of
the
state
of
new
york
have
established
a
separate
and
distinct
conference
part
whereby
after
a
defendant
has
been
indicted,
his
case
will
be
sent
to
the
conference
part
for
discussion
concerning
the
disposition
before
plea.
present
at
this
discussion
are
defense
counsel,
the
prosecutor,
not
necessarily
the
defendant
he
may
waive
his
presence
and
the
judge.
at
that
time,
the
prosecutor
presents
the
information
he
has
with
regard
to
the
case;
defense
attorney
responds
with
regard
to
defenses
or
any
other
matter
that
he'd
like
to
bring
before
the
judge.
at
that
time,
the
judge
after
evaluating
the
entire
record
by
reading
the
grand
jury
minutes,
listening
to
both
sides
advises
the
defense
attorney
of
what
he
would
consider
to
be
a
favorable
or
permissible
disposition
in
this
case,
is
not
as,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
most
of
these
negotiations,
in
fact
all
of
these
negotiations
do
not
appear
on
the
record.
but
this
is
not
necessarily
a
detriment
to
the
plea
bargaining
system
in
kings
county.
because
if
there
is
any
question
certainly
defense
counsel
and
the
court
may
go
on
the
record
and
spread
out,
as
in
this
case,
their
understanding
of
what
the
plea
agreement
was
all
about.
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
that
due
process
would
be
satisfied
if
a
trail
judge
participated
if
at
the
--
well
during
the
negotiations
everything
is
spread
out
on
the
record,
but
that
does
not
necessarily
preclude
or
require
for
that
matter
that
the
negotiations
be
taken
down
step-by-step.
i
see
nothing
constitutionally
wrong
with
the
situation
in
which
at
the
conclusion
of
the
discussions,
the
prosecutor,
defense
counsel,
and
the
judge
spell
out
the
agreement
and
the
terms
of
the
agreement
as
they
understood
them
to
be.
certainly
under
those
circumstances,
particularly
where
a
defense
counsel
may
be
looking
towards
a
claim
of
prejudicial
conduct
or
coercion
would
be
expected
to
indicate
what
he
believed
to
be
the
coercive
aspects
of
this
plea
negotiation.
secondly
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
was
raised
during
oral
argument,
during
petitioner's
argument
that
suppression
hearing
is
markedly
different
because
the
suppression
motion
must
be
addressed
to
a
particular
judge
therefore
establishing
the
strict
necessity
which
he
perceives
under
united
states
versus
jackson.
but
the
easy
answer
to
that
is
that
in
addition
to
all
of
the
prejudicial
information
which
is
brought
out
at
this
suppression
hearing,
at
which
time
the
judge
may
suppress
evidence
which
conclusively
establishes
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
you
may
also
have
the
suppression
part
or
the
counterpart
of
a
plea
part
that
we
have
in
kings
county.
what
he
seems
to
be
saying
is
then,
that
you
have
to
have
the
suppression
motion
directed
to
the
particular
judge
because
the
motion
must
be
made
to
the
judge.
but
on
the
other
hand
a
court
can
just
as
easily
set
up
a
suppression
part
where
a
trial
judge,
or
a
suppression
judge
hears
all
suppression
motions
and
then
after
the
disposition
is
reached.
the
case
may
be
sent
back
to
the
trail
judge.
with
regard
to
the
american
bar
association
standards,
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
not
only
do
they
recommend
an
increased
participation
of
the
trial
judge
or
for
that
matter
any
judge
in
which
the
judge
may
suggest
to
the
defendant
completely
unsolicited.
what
he
would
consider
to
be
a
favorable
disposition.
but
in
addition
to
that,
the
american
bar
association
specifically
rejected
a
proposal
which
would
require
the
disqualification
of
the
judge
on
motion
of
the
defendant
but
as
a
predicate
for
that
motion,
it
must
be
established
that
the
judge
had
been
exposed
to
prejudicial
information
in
the
presentence
report.
even
the
american
bar
association
which
in
1968
recommended
no
judicial
participation
of
plea
negotiations
has
now
said
a
judge
may
only
be
disqualified
if
exposed
to
an
unfavorable
presentence
report.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
once
the
agreement
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
judge
and
the
judge
says,
“no,
i
don't
want
to
go
along
with
this
agreement
go
back
and
bargain
some
more,”
the
judge
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
defendant
wants
to
plead.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
your
honor,
in
all
candor,
this
was
not
that
the
typical
type
of
plea
bargaining
or
horse
trading.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
but
your
honor
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
judge
has
said
to
the
defendant
well
will
you
take
one
to
three,
the
defendant
says
no,
well
how
about
is
zip
to
two.
he
is
not
negotiating
with
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
your
honor,
that
is
unclear
from
the
record,
because
after
the
record
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
your
honor
may
i
qualify
that.
i
can't
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
your
honor
this
judge
did
not
suggest
the
plea
be
taken.
your
honor
this
judge
did
not
say
that
this
prosecution's
case
was
strong
and
the
defense
was
weak
and
then
i
therefore
recommend
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
the
facts
will
presented
through
a
wade
hearing
your
honor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
your
honor
the
fact
really
presented
to
because
a
motion
had
been
maid
to
suppress
in
code
identification
testimony.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
no
your
honor.
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
because
as
i
understand
what
happened
in
this
case,
the
case
has
been
transferred
to
this
trail
judge.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
this
judge
was
going
to
try
the
case.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
he
only
has
the
cases,
he
is
going
to
try,
but
this
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
well
no,
i'm
sorry
if
i've
mislead
the
court.
what
happens
is
that
there
is
a
conference
part,
either
a
disposition
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
no,
only
one
judge
has
the
conference
part
your
honor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
no
he
does
not
your
honor.
either
a
disposition
is
reached
in
what
we
called
criminal
term
part
1-a.
if
no
disposition
is
reached
this
judge,
the
conference
judge
assigns
out
the
cases
to
the
respective
trail
parts
at
which
time
all
motions
are
made
and
if
the
defendant
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
no
this,
the
judge
who
was
involved
in
the
ultimate
plea
negotiations
was
going
to
try
the
case,
but
it's
a
two
step
process.
there
are
two
judges
involved
in
this
case.
the
first
judge
who
is
the
conference
judge
had
worked
out
a
plea
agreement
with
this
defendant
and
this
judge
was
not
going
to
preside
a
trail.
three
months
after
this
defendant
pleaded
guilty
to
the
same
consolidated
indictment,
which
is
before
in
this
court,
he
withdrew
the
plea.
claiming
that
he
had
been
railroaded
and
coerced,
after
that
the
case
was
transferred
out
to
another
judge
at
which
time
when
the
case
was
called,
defense
counsel
approached
the
bench
and
asked
the
judge
if
he
would
have
any
objection
to
resurrecting
the
original
bargain.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
pardon,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
the
conferencing
of
the
case
had
terminated.
the
case
had
been
transferred
for
trail.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
this
is
at
a
pre-trail
hearing.
the
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
plea.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
that
is
correct,
in
open
correct,
and
what
happened
was
that
when
the
case
was
transferred
to
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
yes,
there
was.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
no
court
stenographer
did
not
take
this
down.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
the
wade
hearing
was
transcribed.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
but
my
understanding
of
the
record
was
first
the
case
was
assigned
out
to
mr.
justice
heldt(ph),
at
which
point
defense
counsel
approached
the
bench
and
said
your
honor
would
you
agree
to
a
resurrection
of
the
original
plea
agreement,
namely
a
plea
to
robbery
in
the
second
degree,
at
a
term
of
3.5
to
7.
at
that
point
the
judge
said
fine,
of
course
the
subject
to
me
looking
at
the
probation
report
and
if
the
district
attorney
agrees.
the
district
attorney
agreed.
defendant
–
pardon?
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
the
original
agreement
was
before
the
conference
judge.
now
we
are
in
a
different
trail
part.
he
is
asking
to
resurrect
the
old
agreement.
okay,
then
the
defense
counsel
went
back
to
the
defendant,
defendant
said
i
don't
want
that
agreement.
i
turned
it
down
before
besides,
i'm
interested
and
i
want
to
go
to
trail.
then
he
made
his
motion
to
suppress
identification
testimony.
the
identification
witness
gets
upon
the
witness
stand,
goes
through
the
facts
of
the
crime,
identifies
the
defendants,
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
and
unsolicited
says,
i
wouldn't
forget
that
man's
face
for
20
years.
at
the
conclusion
of
that
hearing
and
that's
all
the
testimony
we
have,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
entire
proceeding
was
transcribed.
petitioner
solely
doesn't
allege
that
there
were
any
other
witnesses.
at
that
time,
or
the
next
day
the
district
attorney
because
this
witness
now
has
gotten
upon
the
witness
stand
and
has
exposed
herself
to
cross
examination
and
has
exposed
the
prosecution's
case.
now
in
the
vernacular
ups
the
ante
and
says
i
will
only
accept
a
robbery
one.
it
is
the
practice
at
the
district
attorney's
office,
expect
in
particularly
notorious
cases.
it
is
the
practice
of
the
district
attorney's
office
in
king's
county
never
to
recommend
a
sentence.
so
that
what
went
on
here
was
not
unusual,
certainly
not
unusual
to
the
county
of
kings.
the
judge
knowing
that
district
attorney
has
now
only
accepted
a
robbery
one
or
would
only
the
robbery
one
plea
which
is
required
by
state
law.
it
requires
the
concurrence
of
both
the
judge
and
the
district
attorney.
the
judge
says
based
on
now
what
i
have
seen,
which
is
certainly
legitimate.
i've
seen
a
witness
testify,
i
have
heard
what
she
has
to
say.
based
on
this
since
it
is
my
practice
in
these
cases,
armed
robbery
cases,
i
impose
sentences,
the
maximum
sentence
which
in
your
case
would
be
12.5
to
25
years.
subject
of
course
to
any
mitigating
factors
in
his
probation
report.
the
judge
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
no
your
honor
what
i
think
judge
is
saying
is,
he
is
not
saying
to
the
defendant
i'm
going
to
penalize
you
because
you're
going
to
trail.
what
he
is
saying
to
the
defendant
is
look
this
is
my
practice
as
a
matter
of
sense
and
discretion.
i
find
that
armed
robberies
in
kings
county
are
particularly
dangerous.
they
pose
a
particular
danger
to
the
safety
of
the
people.
i
have
decided
in
my
discretion
that
armed
robbery
should
be
penalized
more
severely
than
other
criminals,
because
of
that
danger.
in
short,
he
is
saying
if
you
go
to
trail
i
am
not
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
he
would
also
persuade
him
to
the
contrary
in
what
regard
your
honor?
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
in
the
probation
report.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
pardon?
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
no,
no,
but
what
he
is
pointing
out
your
honor
is
that
if
there
are
redeeming
factors
in
this
man's
--
for
example,
what
is
his
participation
in
the
crime?
what
was
the
extent
of
the
crime?
was
anybody
hurt?
does
the
man
have
a
prior
record?
does
the
man
show
signs
of
desire
in
rehabilitation?
does
he
show
any
remorse
for
the
commission
of
the
crime
at
all?
the
judge
is
not
talking
to
the
defendant
at
this
time.
the
judge
is
talking
to
an
attorney
who
understands
this.
if
the
attorney
didn't
convey
this
information
your
honor
to
the
defendant,
then
the
defendant's
complain
is
with
his
attorney
and
not
with
the
judge.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
the
defendant
was
off
on
the
side
at
counsel
table.
this
was
a
conference
now
between
the
judge
and
defense
counsel.
all
this
information
was
conveyed
your
honor
to
the
defendant
through
counsel.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i
certainly
was
not.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
personally
i
would,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
there
are
four
circumstances
or
possibly
three
circumstances
under
which
a
hearing
in
my
view
would
be
totally
unnecessary.
one
circumstance
of
course
would
be
that
this
court
were
to
find
that
any
participation
by
any
judge
whether
he'd
be
the
trail
justice
or
not
violated
due
process
or
if
you
assume
petitioner's
facts
to
be
the
correct
facts
and
you
say
that
due
process
was
not
violated
in
that
case.
or
if
you
assume
my
facts
could
be
the
correct
facts
and
say
that
in
any
event
due
process
was
violated.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
see
we
have
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
what
i'm
saying
–
i'm
not
asking
you
to
you
know
making
findings
of
facts.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
right.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i'm
taking
from
the
language
your
honor
of
the
case
in
which
you
dissented
in
united
states
ex
rel.
mcgrath
v.
lavallee
in
which
there
was
discrepancy
in
what
actually
transpired
between
the
prosecution
defense
and
the
judge.
and
in
your
dissenting
opinion,
you
pointed
out
that
even
if
you
assume
the
prosecution's
case
to
be
what
it
actually
states
it
is,
i
would
still
find
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
the
point
that
i
making
your
honor
is
that
i
think
that
if
petitioner's
facts
are
borne
out
in
the
record.
that
the
judge
said
unequivocally
take
this
back
to
your
client,
if
he
doesn't
like
the
6
to
12.
if
he
goes
to
trail
and
he
is
convicted
i'm
going
to
give
12.5
to
25,
your
honor
i
would
have
no
hesitation
to
saying
that,
that
was
a
bold
threat
to
impose
a
penalty.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
pardon?
and
would
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
regrettably
your
honor
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record.
there
are
two
interpretations
which
can
be
placed
on
what
transpired.
we
think
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
page
33
note
28,
that
our
position
is
the
more
persuasive
position.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i
concede
that
your
honor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
yes,
your
honor
that
is
my
understanding.
however,
because
of
the
seriousness
of
these
particular
allegations
and
that
we
indeed
feel
that
if
petitioner
is
account
is
the
correct
to
account
that
due
process
would
be
violated.
we
nevertheless
feel
that
a
hearing
maybe
mandated
in
this
particular
circumstance.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i
was
just
–
under
no
authority
of
this
court.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
petitioner
would
have
the
burden
of
establishing
what
went
on.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
that
is
correct.
we
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
the
participation
--
i
would
like
to
classify
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
that
is
correct
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
hearing,
because
his
participation.
he
certainly
was
actively
engaged,
but
i
think
that
there
are
distinctions
that
must
be
drawn.
i
think
that
a
judge
that
says
look
if
you
go
to
trial
or
if
you
take
a
plea
of
guilty
now
i
will
offer
you
6
to
12.
but
if
you
go
to
trail
and
if
you
are
convicted,
i
will
afford
you
every
consideration
that
i
afford
every
other
defendant
who
is
convicted
before
my
court
and
i
will
sentence
you
according
to
the
valid
exercise
of
my
sentencing
prerogatives.
i
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
understanding
how
the
trail
judge
in
that
case
then
becomes
an
adversary
or
a
prosecutor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
well,
your
honor
in
santa
bella
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
it
was
a
promise
by
a
prosecutor,
which
the
defendant
then
relied
upon
and
than
the
court
refused
to
honor,
excuse
me
that
the
prosecutor
then
reneged
on
his
promise.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
the
prosecutor
reneged
on
his
promise,
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
clear
distinction
between
the
conduct
of
a
prosecutor
and
how
far
we
would
permit
a
prosecutor
to
go,
as
opposed
to
a
trail
judge.
for
example,
in
my
own
opinion,
i
don't
think
that
a
judge
could
threaten
the
kind
of
treatment,
that
the
prosecutor
in
bordenkircher
threatened,
because
under
those
circumstances
the
defendant
has
no
alternative
but
to
believe
that
the
trail
judge
because
of
his
conduct
is
now
the
prosecutor
and
now
he
is
got
to
go
in
a
court,
not
only
fight
the
evidence
of
the
prosecutor,
but
he
has
got
to
fight
a
hostile
trial
judge.
but
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
yes
i
would
your
honor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
i
would
have
difficulty
with
an
announced
policy
that
anybody
who
is
convicted
in
my
court
would
only
be
sentenced
to
the
maximum,
because
at
that
point
you
are
taking
out
what
sentencing
requires,
that
is
flexibility
and
the
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i
still
think
that
the
judge
under
those
circumstances
would
be
of
imposing
a
penalty,
because
it's
not
based
on
any
factors
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i
think
that
it
is
wrong,
that
prior
to
trail,
before
a
judge
has
had
any
information
given
to
him
about
a
particular
case,
with
particular
facts
and
circumstances
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
alright.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
then
i
misunderstood.
what
he
is
saying
that
it
is
always
subject
to
exceptions
or
subject
to
mitigating
factors,
at
that
point
he
is
willing
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
this
is
an
individual
and
this
person
should
be
sentenced
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
pardon?
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
that
is
correct,
that
is
what
our
judge
did,
and
i'm
saying
of
that
was
fine,
but
what
mr.
fisher
was
arguing
is
that
it
was
a
two
step
process.
he
didn't
say
if
convicted
and
subject
to
the
mitigating
factors.
under
mr.
fisher's
view
of
the
facts,
the
judge
first
offered
to
6
to
12.
defense
counsel
went
back,
spoke
to
the
defendant.
the
defendant
said
i
want
to
go
to
trail,
i'm
not
pleading
guilty
and
finish
with
it.
trail
counsel
went
back
to
the
bench
and
he
said
your
honor
he
doesn't
want
the
plea.
at
which
point
according
the
petitioner
the
trail
judge
said
well
if
he
doesn't
like
that
take
this
back
to
him,
if
he
is
convicted
i'm
going
to
give
him
12.5
to
25.
according
to
petitioner
the
statement
about
the
practice,
the
statement
about
probationary
report
was
merely
an
afterthought,
a
window
dressing
brought
up
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
which
was
six
weeks
after
the
plea.
that's
what
i
perceive
to
be
the
distinction,
because
under
mr.
fisher's
facts
under
petitioner's
facts
the
judge
is
completely
disregarding
his
sentencing
discretion
and
is
saying
look
i
will
give
you
--
based
on
what
i
know
now,
i'll
give
you
one
sentence.
if
you
go
to
trial,
i
will
give
you
another
sentence.
under
those
circumstance
your
honor,
i
believe
that
he
is
being
penalized
for
asserting
his
rights
and
that
type
of
case
would
come
under
the
mandate
of
jackson.
but
where
a
judge
says
i
will
treat
you
like
everybody
else.
you
will
be
sentenced
according
to
the
valid
exercise
in
my
sentencing
prerogative;
a
defendant
is
not
being
penalized
for
going
to
trail.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
yes,
it
did
your
honor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
your
honor
in
brady
vs.
united
states
mr.
justice
brennan,
pointed
out
specifically
in
his
opinion
of
parker
vs.
north
carolina
that
one
of
the
big
considerations
in
the
jackson
case
was
the
death
penalty
and
until
corbett
was
handed
down,
i
had
assumed
that,
that
was
probably
the
primary
motivating
factor
after
reading
corbett.
my
understanding
of
the
law
is
that
where
a
statutory
scheme
is
setup
which
automatically
subjects
an
individual
to
a
penalty
not
--
that
doesn't
mean
he
has
to
get
it,
but
automatically
subjection
to
a
penalty
which
would
not
be
available
if
he
pleaded
guilty
that
would
come
under
jackson
and
violate
due
process.
in
other
words
the
statute
would
say
defendant
on
armed
robbery
cases
get
15
years,
if
he
pleads
guilty,
he
automatically
gets
7
years.
i
would
have
difficulty
with
that
situation.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
in
corbett,
your
honor,
the
defendant
whether
or
not
he
pleaded
non
vogue,
or
went
to
trail
was
subject
to
the
same
type
of
penalty
if
he
pleaded
non-vogue,
the
trial
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
my
understanding
in
corbett,
your
honor
and
i
maybe
mistaken
was
that
if
was
that
if
you
went
to
trail
and
jury
found
him
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree,
he
got
a
definite
sentence.
if
he
pleaded
non
vult,
he
could
be
found
on
the
same
facts.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
he
could,
but
the
point
is
that
he
could
also
be
subject
to
the
same
penalty.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
the
judge
could
penalize
him
for
the
same
thing
and
that
there
was
no
discrimination
or
discrepancy
between
the
two
situations.
in
fact
in
jackson,
the
opinion
pointed
out
that
if
the
jury
could
find
him
guilty
and
penalize
him
and
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i
would
have
to
retreat
on
that.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i
think
that
when
a
trial
judge
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
if
i
may
articulate,
i
think
that
a
trial
judge,
take
a
step
back.
it's
certainly,
there
is
no
question
that
a
trial
judge
is
going
to
impose
sentence,
it's
no
secret,
number
two
that
when
a
trial
judge
imposed
a
sentence
that
if
a
defendant
pleads
guilty,
it
will
definitely
or
in
most
cases
would
be
more
lenient
sentence.
the
state
is
certainly
encouraged
either
through
the
trial
judge,
prosecutor
or
the
legislature
to
encourage
the
taking
of
pleas
by
the
offering
of
substantial
benefits.
but
i
think
that
when
a
judge
announces
before
trial,
without
considering
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case,
without
knowing
anything
about
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i
understand
that,
but
i
think
the
difference
between
the
legislature,
your
honor
and
trial
judge
was
succinctly
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
parker
v.
north
carolina
in
footnote
8,
where
he
said
that
there
is
a
distinction
a
human
distinction
between
the
statute,
which
is
rigidly
implied,
and
a
judge
who
can
be
approached
and
any
evidence
of
over
bearing
or
overreaching
will
appear
on
the
record.
i
think
that
when
a
judge
goes
on
the
record
and
says,
this
is
what
i'm
going
to
do
to
you.
under
certain
circumstances
that
can
only
be
construed
as
a
threat.
a
statue
is
a
neutral
across
the
board
type
of
application.
the
judge
on
the
other
hand
is
--
may
through
his
rulings,
as
petitioner
points
out
through
his
personality,
influence
the
conduct
of
the
trial,
which
may
not
be,
well
i
would
hesitate
to
say
this,
but
made
to
say
this,
but
may
not
be
readily
apparent
in
a
record
of
trial.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
could
you?
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
your
honor,
that
what
seemed
to
come
under
bordenkicher
and
i
still
maintain
that
there
is
a
very
definite
distinction
between
the
prosecutor's
threat
to
recommend
a
sentence
and
a
judge's
threat
to
impose
the
sentence
because
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
by
threatening
to
impose
the
sentence
based
on
nothing
more
than
the
defendant's
assertion
of
his
rights
to
go
to
trial.
i
think
that
at
that
point,
the
defendant
can
only
assume
that
the
trail
judge
has
become
in
fact
the
prosecutor
and
is
no
longer
that
attached
neutral
magistrate,
which
we
have
all
heard
so
much
about.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
yes
i'm,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
only
suggest
that
the
american
bar
association
while
they
are
not
considering
the
constitutional
ramifications
of
what
they
are
doing
certainly
would
not
suggest
that
the
practices
that
they
advocate
would
also
run
counter
to
the
constitution.
my
problem
with
sentencing
in
this
particular
case
is
that
when
a
judge
without
regard
to
any
factors,
other
than
the
fact
that
an
individual
--
mr.
richard
elliot
mischel
your
honor,
i
understand
that
to
be
correct
and
in
addition
to
the
proposals
of
the
american
bar
association
or
the
standards
certainly
would
not
be
required
in
the
states
and
the
state
would
be
able
to
adopt
the
system
of
contract,
but
i
think
of
the
system
in
kings
county
fully
comports
with
due
process.
