mr.
steven
fisher
chief
justice
brennan
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
practice
of
plea
bargaining
and
the
voluntariness
of
a
guilty
plea.
its
distinguishing
feature
is
that
it
presents
for
review,
the
issue
of
whether
and
to
what
extent;
a
sitting
trial
justice
may
participate
in
the
actual
give
and
take
of
negotiations
for
a
guilty
plea
and
it
invites
the
resolution
of
a
question
specifically
left
open
in
brady
against
united
states
of
what
the
consequences
would
be
if
a
judge
were
to
deliberately
employ
his
sentencing
power
to
induce
a
defendant
to
tender
a
guilty
plea
by
threatening
to
impose
a
harsh
sentence
after
trial.
harold
ramsey,
the
petitioner
was
24
years
old
when
he
took
this
plea.
he
had
a
history
of
emotional
problems
and
was
certainly
no
stranger
to
the
criminal
justice
system
in
kings
county.
he
had
been
a
juvenile
delinquent;
he
had
been
adjudicated
a
youthful
offender
and
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony
prior
to
this
involvement
with
the
law.
in
this
case,
he
was
charged
with
two
separate
armed
robberies.
and
as
his
case
made
its
way
to
the
courts
of
kingâ€™s
county,
he
appeared
in
a
conference
part,
which
was
specially
designated
in
king's
county
for
the
exploration
with
the
possibility
of
disposition
without
trial.
in
that
part,
he
entered
a
guilty
plea
to
the
reduced
charge
of
unarmed
robbery
and
did
so
upon
a
sentencing
promise
made
by
the
judge
of
an
indeterminate
term
from
three
and
a
half
to
seven
years
incarceration
that
being
only
slightly
greater
than
the
very
minimum
he
could
have
received
under
new
york
law.
subsequently,
he
was
through
that
plea
and
the
case
was
transferred
to
a
trial
part
where
mr.
ramsey
for
the
first
time
encountered
the
judge
whose
conduct
is
called
into
question
here.
it
was
18
months
after
he
had
been
arrested
and
he
had
been
incarcerated
throughout
that
period
of
time
when
mr.
ramsey
was
afforded
a
pre-trial
wade
hearing.
one
witness
was
called,
she
identified
the
petitioner
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
armed
robbery
quite
definitely
and
the
defense
tried
to
raise
some
issue
as
to
the
propriety
of
a
pre-trial
identification
techniques.
however,
the
next
day,
the
next
morning,
prior
to
the
conclusion
of
that
hearing,
the
defendant
mr.
ramsey
offered
to
plead
guilty.
this
time
to
the
charge
of
armed
robbery
has
charged
in
the
indictment,
one
count
to
cover
both
indictments.
this
plea
upon
a
sentencing
promise
offered
by
the
judge
of
an
indeterminate
term
now
from
six
to
twelve
years
incarceration.
there
is
no
transcript
of
the
negotiations
that
led
to
this
guilty
plea,
because
as
is
the
custom
in
king's
county
and
in
new
york.
plea
negotiations
are
generally
conducted
at
bench
conferences
and
are
not
recorded,
they
are
not
on
the
record,
but
we
learn
about
the
negotiations
and
what
happened
to
lead
the
petitioner
to
plead
guilty,
because
immediately
prior
to
sentence,
the
petitioner
moved
on
paper
supported
by
his
own
affidavit
and
the
affidavit
of
defense
counsel.
mr.
steven
fisher
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
steven
fisher
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
in
fact,
at
oral
argument
in
the
appellate
division
below,
the
district
attorney
quite
candidly
conceded
that
this
type
of
negotiations
goes
on
all
the
time.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
i
would
ask
that
the
court
establish
a
procedural
safeguard
based
upon
my
analysis
of
jackson,
the
needless
encouragement
of
guilty
plea.
i
would
think
that
the
active
participation
of
a
trial
judge
in
the
give
and
take
of
negotiations
for
a
guilty
plea
encourages
a
defendant
to
plead
guilty.
and
it
serves
no
state
interest
therefore
it
is
needless.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
i
think
that
an
agreement
maybe
reached
between
the
defense
counsel
and
the
prosecutor,
and
that
agreement
maybe
presented
to
the
trail
judge.
now,
my
argument
is
limited
essentially
to
judges
who
are
scheduled
to
preside
at
trail
in
the
event
that
no
disposition
is
reached.
mr.
steven
fisher
that's
correct.
i
find
no
constitutional
objection
to
the
conference
part
concept
that
is
established
in
king's
county
where
a
defendant
who
may
invite
judicial
participation
can
do
so
knowing
that
the
judge
with
whom
he
is
negotiating
will
not
preside
at
a
trail
should
no
disposition
be
reached.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
source
of
the
encouragement
to
plead
guilty
is
the
defendant's
knowledge
that
a
rejection
of
a
plea
offer
made
by
the
court,
by
the
judge
will
mean
a
trial
held
before
the
same
judge
who
may
view
him
then
as
a
guilty
man
who
has
rejected
a
fair
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
would
not
object
to
the
presentation
as
in
the
federal
system
of
an
agreement
being
presented
to
a
judge
who
then
may
ratify
or
reject
the
offer.
the
judge
must
act
independently
in
accordance
with
his
own
responsibility
and
certainly,
his
responsibility
is
to
ultimately
impose
sentence,
so
that
an
independent
agreement
reached
by
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
cannot
bind
the
judge
and
they
may
present
that
i
find
nothing,
i
do
not
find
the
same
course
of
impact
in
that
presentation
to
a
judge.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
the
first
difference
that
comes
to
mind
is
although,
assume
that,
that
agreement
was
rejected
by
the
judge.
there
would
be
no
personal
investment
in
the
plea
bargaining
procedure
by
the
judge.
there
would
be
no
personal
rejection
as
in
the
case
where
a
judge
himself
makes
a
specific
plea
offer
and
the
defendant
rejects
it.
the
judge
apparently
or
presumably
would
make
an
offer
that
he
would
plea
fair
to
all
sides
and
by
the
defendant
rejecting
the
offer
made
by
the
court,
he
would
then
face
the
possibility
that
the
judge
would
resent
that
reject,
and
that
his
resentment
might
either
intentionally
or
subconsciously
work
its
way
either
into
a
sentencing
function
or
into
the
discretionary
ruling
that
he
would
make
a
trial.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
the
conference
part,
there
is
a
special
part
to
which
cases
are
sent
after
arraignment
that
is
established
by
court
rule.
no
statute
that
i'm
aware
in
new
york.
mr.
steven
fisher
there
is
no
statute
rule
or
other
--
mr.
steven
fisher
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
fisher
yes.
and
it's
been
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
state
that
judges
do
participate
in
plea
negotiations.
although,
some
cases
have
questioned
it
as
referring
to
the
aba
standards,
which
have
only
last
week
been
amended.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judge
becomes
an
advocate
for
a
disposition,
his
own
perhaps.
in
this
case,
this
is
a
good
example
of
where
the
prosecutor
is
taken
out
of
the
plea
negotiating
procedure,
because
all
the
prosecutor
did
here
was
prior
to
the
wade
hearing,
he
said
that,
he
would
consent
to
a
reduction
in
charge,
he
would
consent
to
a
guilty
plea
to
unarmed
robbery;
his
consent
being
needed
under
statute.
after
the
wade
hearing,
he
withdrew
that
consent,
but
the
district
attorney
never
took
any
position
and
indicated
to
the
court
that
he
would
have
no
position
on
sentencing.
so,
the
whole
question
was
--
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
in
this
particular
case
and
under
these
circumstances,
the
bargaining
was
between
the
judge
and
the
defendant.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
it's
called
--
mr.
steven
fisher
it's
called
pre-bargaining
in
king's
county
your
honor.
i
must
say
though
that
there
are
many
instances
in
which
the
prosecutor
will
make
the
sentence
recommendation
in
king's
county
and
may
even
condition
his
consent
to
a
reduction
in
charge
upon
the
imposition
of
a
sentence,
which
is
agreed
to.
so,
to
that
extent,
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
in
all
cases
in
king's
county
the
prosecutor
does
not
participate.
i
simply
say
that
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
in
effect
did
not
participate
expect
to
first
give
and
then
withdraw
his
consent
to
the
reduction
in
the
plea,
in
the
charge.
mr.
steven
fisher
it
was
your
honor.
the
proposal
that
we
cite
that
was
advanced
with
the
aba
was
adopted.
and
it
permits
at
the
request
of
both
sides
when
the
defense
counsel
and
the
defendant
and
prosecutor
are
having
difficulty
reaching
an
agreement,
they
may
request
a
plea
conference
as
it
were
at
which
the
judge
maybe
the
moderator,
and
we
find
the
difficulties
with
the
part
of
the
adopted
aba
standards,
which
indicates
that
judge
may
independently
offer
a
disposition
that
would
be
acceptable
to
him.
mr.
steven
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
don't
think
that
his
position
as
a
moderator
would
be
consistent
with
constitutional
principles.
certainly
i
would
have
objections
to
his
proposing
a
disposition
that
would
be
acceptable
to
him.
i
would
add,
however,
that
in
the
same
aba
standards
adopted
last
week,
it
is
quite
emphatically
said
that
a
judge
shall
neither
by
word
nor
demeanor
indicate
to
a
defendant
that
he
believes
a
plea
ought
to
be
entered.
and
it
also
says
that
all
this
negotiation
at
this
conference
shall
be
conducted
on
the
record.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
plea
bargaining
was
conducted
off
the
record.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
it
seems
established
that
prior
to
the
wade
hearing
and
generally
they
do
discuss
the
fact,
the
prosecutor
will
say,
we
think
we
can
prove
this
and
defense
counsel
may
say,
well,
but
we
don't
--
mr.
steven
fisher
he
does
your
honor.
and
in
this
case,
there
were
negotiations.
mr.
steven
fisher
he
could.
mr.
steven
fisher
in
this
case,
it
seems
established
and
uncontested
that
prior
to
the
wade
hearing,
this
very
trial
judge
had
apparently
an
unreported
bench
conference,
again
extended
to
the
defendant
the
plea
offer
involving
an
unarmed
robbery
carrying
a
three
and
a
half
to
seven
year
sentence
and
that
the
petitioner
rejected
that
offer,
insisted
he
was
innocent
and
requested
that
he
would
be
permitted
to
go
to
trial.
what
happened
then
was
that
the
witness
testified
at
the
wade
hearing
and
the
crucial
part
of
the
record,
the
clearest
account
of
what
happened
at
that
negotiation
following
the
wade
hearing
is
given
at
page
28
of
the
record
where
the
court
and
the
defense
counsel
engage
in
an
exchange
where
the
council
speaks
about
what
followed
the
witness's
testimony.
and
he
says
very
briefly
there
was
some
talk
about
a
plea
of
guilty
and
at
that
time
the
plea
of
guilty
was
discussed,
the
plea
of
guilty
was
talked
about
as
i
came
up
to
the
bench
and
we
discussed
it.
and
your
honor
said
that
you
would
give
six
to
twelve
with
the
district
attorney's
approval.
i
came
back
and
said
to
my
client
six
to
twelve
and
he
said,
no
and
it
went
back
and
forth
and
finally,
we
arrived
at
a
decision,
according
to
judge
about
the
district
attorney
having
withdrawn
his
consent
at
that
time
to
a
charge
reduction.
the
lawyer
agrees,
and
then
goes
on.
we
arrived
at
a
six
to
twelve-year
sentence,
prior
to
that
time,
the
admonition
of
the
statement
was
made
to
me
that
if
this
guy
goes
to
trial
and
he
is
convicted,
he
is
going
to
get
twelve-and-a-half
to
twenty
five.
your
honor
told
me
to
take
that
back
to
my
client,
which
at
that
time
i
did
judge,
i
gave
him
that
warning
and
the
judge
now
explains
and
says
subject
of
course
to
my
reading
to
probational
report,
it
is
a
practice
in
my
court
when
there
is
an
armed
robbery
to
impose
a
maximum
sentence,
unless
there
are
mitigating
circumstances
to
which
the
lawyer
replies.
well,
i
think
your
honor
in
light
of
everything
that
that
was
the
basis
of
why
the
defendant
took
the
plea.
our
position
is
that
this
plea
on
this
record
is
plainly
coerce.
now
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
proposition
stated
as
recently
by
this
court
as
december
in
corbett
against
new
jersey
that
a
state
may
indeed
offer
to
a
defendant
substantial
benefits
in
return
for
a
guilty
plea.
and
we
learned
in
bordenkircher
that
a
prosecutor
may
threaten
to
bring
charges,
which
are
justified
on
the
evidence
in
order
to
induce
a
defendant
to
plead
guilty
that
on
the
theory
that
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
arguably
possess
equal
bargaining
power.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
think
that
that
might
enter
a
judge's
sentencing
decision.
but
this
judge
--
mr.
steven
fisher
and
may
give,
yes
he
might.
mr.
steven
fisher
no.
i
do
not
challenge
that,
but
i
think
that
where
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
part
company
in
the
context
of
this
case
is
whether
the
proposition
that
a
state
may
offer
substantial
benefits
to
induce
or
to
persuade
the
defendant
to
plead
guilty
whether
that
proposition
includes
a
trial
judge.
we
submit
that
it
does
not;
that
the
court
must
draw
a
line
at
the
trial
judge
and
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
case,
you
cannot
count
a
judge
as
a
representative
of
the
state.
his
obligation
is
to
stand
between
the
state
and
the
accused
to
ensure
that
the
accused
is
afforded
all
protections
and
safeguards
to
which
he
is
entitled
under
law.
we
do
not
think
that,
that
role
is
consistent
with
a
judge
doing
what
this
judge
did
here,
that
is
saying
i
will
simultaneously,
i
will
now
give
you
a
sentence
of
six
to
twelve,
but
if
this
guy
is
convicted
that
after
trial
he
will
get
twelve
and
a
half
to
25.
mr.
steven
fisher
in
certain
aspects
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
that
within
the
confines
of
the
statement
announced
in
corbett
that
a
state
may
offer.
i
do
not
think
that
the
word
state
in
that
statement,
it
was
meant
to
include
trial
judges.
i
think
it
was
meant
to
include
prosecutors
who
represent
the
state
as
the
prosecuting
body,
not
as
the
adjudicating
body
there
are
different
roles.
a
defendant
may
not
be
faced
on
the
one
hand
with
a
prosecutor
trying
to
persuade
him
to
give
up
his
fifth
amendment
constitutional
right
not
to
plead
guilty
and
sixth
amendment
right
to
go
to
trial,
and
then
also
face
the
judge
who
is
supposed
to
stand
between
him
and
the
prosecutor
also
face
the
judge
who
is
attempting
to
persuade
him.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
have
no
objection
to
that
procedure,
because
i
do
not
see
again
the
coercion.
mr.
steven
fisher
that
may
enter
into
--
mr.
steven
fisher
well
that
might
enter.
i
think
it
might
be
better
practice
to
go
to
another
judge,
but
i
don't
think
it's
constitutionally
mandated,
because
in
the
event
the
plea
agreement
is
reached,
it
is
essential
that
the
plea
be
presented
that
the
agreement
be
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
find
nothing
wrong
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
the
difference
i
think
is
when
a
judge
offers
a
specific
disposition
he
becomes
an
advocate
for
it
and
the
risk
that
the
defendant
faces
is
a
rejection
of
a
disposition,
apparently
desired
by
the
judge.
when
a
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
on
the
other
hand
agree
independently
to
a
plea
bargain,
they
must,
they
have
no
other
alternative,
but
to
present
it
to
the
court,
to
the
judge
because
the
judge,
a
guilty
plea
may
only
be
tended
to
the
judge,
there
is
no
alternative.
and
to
require
in
those
circumstances
that
a
state
or
federal
system
mandate
that
the
case
be
transferred
from
one
judge
to
another
and
those
circumstances
are
made
to
prove
i
think
too
burdensome
and
would
not
constitute
a
needless
encouragement
under
my
analysis
of
jackson.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
steven
fisher
both.
i
think
it
is
both.
the
defendant,
if
he
expresses
an
interest
in
pleading
guilty
and
does
so
to
the
judge
and
judge
is
likely
to
conclude
that
the
defendant
was
interested
in
pleading
guilty
is
most
likely
guilty
in
fact.
mr.
steven
fisher
it
would
and
the
encouragement
to
plead
guilty
would
be
precisely
the
same.
the
difference
however
is,
that
ire
jackson
as
prohibiting
the
needless
encouragement
of
guilty
pleads
and
while
in
a
suppression
case
of
a
defendant
who
seeks
the
suppression
of
inculpatory
evidence,
he
must
address
his
suppression
motion
to
the
judge
who
must
then
decide,
be
it
confession
or
fourth
amendment
question.
therefore,
the
judicial
participation
in
that
circumstance
is
hardly
needless,
it
is
essential
even
though
it
may
ultimately
work
some
coercive
or
encouraging
effect
on
the
defendant
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
i
think
not,
i
think
in
that
circumstance,
i
can
see
no
state
interest
advanced
by
the
participation
of
a
trial
judge.
mr.
steven
fisher
right
and
in
that
county
there
would
be
judicial
participation
in
plea.
mr.
steven
fisher
there
could
not
be
under
my
proposal.
mr.
steven
fisher
except
that
i
--
that
argument
might
be
made,
but
i
think
whoever
--
mr.
steven
fisher
that's
right,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
up
to
whoever
propose
that
argument
to
demonstrate
what
that
need.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
my
reasoning
is
based
on
what
i
see
to
be
the
underlying
principle
in
the
jackson
case,
which
is
that
the
constitution
will
--
mr.
steven
fisher
what
do
i
think
it
means,
i
think
that
what
jackson
holds
is
that
some
encouragement
or
encouragement
to
a
defendant
to
plead
guilty
is
not
always
violative
of
due
process,
but
the
test
of
jackson
is
needless
that
is
whether
it
serves
a
legitimate
goal
and
whether
or
not
that
goal
can
be
achieved
by
some
other
means.
and
i
think
in
this
the
case
the
participation
of
a
trail
judge
in
plea
bargain
serves
no
state
interest
and
therefore
is
needless
and
it
encourages
the
defendant
to
plead
guilty.
therefore
it's
needless
encouragement
and
is
barred
under
the
principle
of
jackson.
mr.
steven
fisher
absolutely.
mr.
steven
fisher
yes,
i
do.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
think
the
principles
of
jackson
are
prohibited.
yes,
jackson
of
course
--
i
think
there
is
a
case
that
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
called,
i
think
it's
united
states
against
mccoy
where
the
district,
the
circuit
court
--
the
d.c
circuit
questioned,
is
presented
precisely
with
the
judge
who
announces
that
his
policy
is
to
impose
a
maximum
sentence
upon
anyone
convicted
at
the
trail
of
armed
robbery.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
of
course
that's
a
closer
question
of
course
because
there
is
difference
between
a
lawyer
saying
to
his
client,
this
judge
is
reputed
to
have
a
policy
of
imposing
the
maximum.
the
difference
between
that
and
a
judge
announcing
in
opening
court
to
a
defendant
leaving
no
room
for
doubt,
yes
i
have
that
policy
you
will
get
the
maximum
if
you
are
convicted.
mr.
steven
fisher
your
honor,
i
agree
with
what
i
think
is
a
consensus
of
opinion
in
the
commentaries
and
the
case
is
that
whatever
benefit
may
accrue
to
the
defendants
as
a
class,
but
this
increase
of
information
as
they
say
is
outweighed
by
the
coercive
effect
of
a
judge's
announcement
or
judge's
participation
in
plea
bargain.
mr.
steven
fisher
it
was
--
i
am
not
familiar.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
think
i
would
have
trouble
with
it.
the
whole
concept
of
differential
sentencing
is
troublesome.
it's
true
as
justice
white
suggested
that
a
judge
may
take
into
a
account
the
defendants
willingness
to
admit
his
guilt,
to
take
the
first
step
on
the
road
towards
rehabilitation,
but
an
announced
policy
of
differential
sentencing
i
think
would
run
into
the
same
problem
that
we
find
in
this
case
and
i
think
--
mr.
steven
fisher
which
was
twice
--
mr.
steven
fisher
there
are
differing
interpretations
now
offered
to
the
court
by
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
respondent
has
suggested
in
a
footnote
of
his
brief
as
i
point
out
in
my
reply
that
if
the
sequence
of
events
occurred
as
i
read
the
record
to
show
that
i
may
very
well
be
entitled
to
the
relief
i
seek
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
tacitly
at
least
he
has
conceded
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
establish
which
of
the
interpretation
occurred
is
required.
our
position
is
--
mr.
steven
fisher
who
is
trial
counselor?
mr.
steven
fisher
yes.
mr.
steven
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
subject
to
his
reading
of
the
probation
report
that
is
not
--
i
don't
believe
very
meaningful
since
in
new
york
every
court
is
obliged
by
law,
every
judge
is
obliged
by
law
prior
to
imposing
sentence
to
at
least
order
and
consider
probation
report
but
he's
not
obligated
--
mr.
steven
fisher
well
he
has
obviously
misrepresented
his
position
because
this
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty
to
armed
robbery
and
received
less
than
half
the
maximum
sentence.
so
what
he
really
meant
was,
that
anyone
convicted
in
his
court
--
mr.
steven
fisher
after
not
guilty.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
steven
fisher
it
is
my
experience
that
is
not
the
--
it
is
the
custom
--
mr.
steven
fisher
well,
in
the
middle
of
the
criminal
trial
certainly
when
issues
of
law
are
raised.
but
not
--
mr.
steven
fisher
you
certainly
could
i
think
that
it
must
be
--
any
negotiations
i
think
the
better
practice
is
to
transcribe,
but
it's
simply
not
the
custom
in
kings
county
to
do
so.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
understand
that,
and
it's
the
recommendation
of
the
aba
with
which
i
agree.
mr.
steven
fisher
that's
the
implication
of
the
statement
in
core
of
it
as
i
understand.
mr.
steven
fisher
yes
and
of
course
the
range
of
the
--
mr.
steven
fisher
yes.
mr.
steven
fisher
yes.
mr.
steven
fisher
may
a
state
have
an
announced
--
mr.
steven
fisher
yes
he
may.
mr.
steven
fisher
i
don't
think
you
can,
i
don't
think
you
can.
mr.
steven
fisher
no
we
can't
your
honor.
mr.
steven
fisher
he
may
--
once
a
bargain
is
struck
yes
he
may
say
he
accepts
it
and
may
give
his
reasons
for
accepting
it
if
he
so
desires.
mr.
steven
fisher
no,
that
is
not
my
proposition;
my
proposition
is
that
he
may
not
prior
to
the
plea
agreement.
mr.
steven
fisher
well
i
believe
--
mr.
steven
fisher
well
let
me
reconsider,
i
think
yes.
i
think
yes
the
announcement
of
a
policy
causes
me
trouble,
the
announcement
of
whether
it
would
be
at
sentencing;
it
may
be
in
the
individual
case
--
mr.
steven
fisher
in
proper
cases,
would
be
more
acceptable
to
my
sense
of
due
process,
thank
you.
