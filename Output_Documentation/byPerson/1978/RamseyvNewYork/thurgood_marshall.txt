justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
fisher
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
in
brooklyn,
is
this
by
statute,
by
rule
or
by
what,
this
bench
conference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
statute
rule
or
what
says
that
a
judge
shall
participate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
a
custom
that
has
grown?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
judge
is
a
party
in
this
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
on
which
side
is
the
judge
on
in
the
negotiation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
one
of
the
parties,
district
attorney
has
no
position
on
sentence,
what
is
the
good
of
plea
bargaining,
who
is
doing
the
bargaining
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
normally
understood
to
be
plea
bargaining?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
that
a
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
to
pause
at
one
another
point.
at
this
conference
in
this
case,
did
they
discuss
the
facts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
judge
is
going
to
trial,
the
case
--
gets
a
pre-run
of
the
case
that
he
is
on
a
later
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could
get
a
full
run,
because
he
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
the
trial
of
the
case
would
be
a
new
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn't
they
have
these
statements
or
negotiations
transcribed,
you
say,
they
never
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
reason
for
it?
i
mean
in
the
middle
of
a
criminal
trial,
and
you
have
a
bar
conference,
sibebar
conference,
isn't
that
transcribed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
why
could
you
do
it
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
some
counties,
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understand
there
was
no
go
back,
in
this
one
it
was
all
gone
with
the
judge
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
going
back
and
forth
to
the
judge,
the
judge
held
the
whole
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
negotiate
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
when
we
have
got
--
.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
as
i
understand
prosecutor
said
practically
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
at
least
it
is
in
the
record
that
judge
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
judge
participated
in
the
merits
of
the
case.
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
did
the
judge
participate
in
the
merits
of
this
prosecution
or
this
man's
alleged
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
ask
what
where
the
facts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
ask
what
where
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
that,
i'm
not
talking
about
this
theory,
which
the
judge
have
--
.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
this
judge,
was
he
going
to
try
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
this
current
theory,
does
he
only
have
the
cases
he
is
going
to
try
or
does
he
have
all
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
can
that
be
a
conference
part?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
can't
be
remarked,
every
judge
has
conference
part.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
tries
all
of
those
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
did
i
get
to
understand
in
this
case
this
judge
was
going
to
try
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
doing
the
trail
or
do
one
of
these
conference
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
doing
the
trail
or
this
conference
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
was
it
that
the
judge
is
sitting
on
the
bench,
was
that
the
trail
of
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
pre-trail
hearing
held
in
open
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
open
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
was
the
court
stenographer
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
didn't
take
this
down.
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
the
french
civil
law,
you're
guilty
until
you're
prove
innocent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
also
says
you
might
persuade
me
to
the
contrary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
he
said
unless
there
is
some
kind
of
circumstance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
well
â€“
well
there
is
another
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
crazy.
i
don't
know
what
is
it
that
would
say
that
there
is
a
nice
armed
robbery
is
not
bad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
defendant
wasn't
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
think
we
need
here
to
find
out
what
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
thought
they
are
worried.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
would
you
like
to
have
a
hearing
and
find
out
what
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
in
the
assumed
fact.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
difficulty
assuming
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said,
assuming
your
facts
--.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
son,
let
me
tell
to
you
son,
like
a
father
to
a
son.
i
didn't
think
that
was,
i
thought
it
was
little
over
reaching.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
this
case
fit
with
santa
bella
case--
i'm
sure
you
know
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall

him.
