mr.

the
aba
standard
on
which
you
side
on
the
footnote
on
page
16
of
your
brief
was
in
fact
changed
last
week,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
not
agree
with
that
if
the
judge
is
the
one
who,
if
the
board
then
fails,
is
going
to
turn
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
even
as
a
moderator?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fisher
you
rely.
of
course,
you
are
least
as
i
understand
it
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
contend
for
a
rule
that
would
never
permit
the
judge
to
participate
in
the
bargaining
itself
to
the
extent
at
least
that
the
defense
counsel
said
he
did
in
this
case,
if
that
judge
is
going
to
be
the
trial
judge.i
s
that
the
basis
of
that
submission,
the
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
judge
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
or
is
it
rather
the
potential
resentment
and
therefore
vindictiveness
of
the
trial
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
judges
all
the
time
deal
with
the
rule
that
certain
evidence
should
be
excluded,
because
of
sometimes
for
reasons
not
having
to
do
at
all
with
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
person
very
probative
evidence
of
his
guilt,
but
a
judge
is
required
under
the
law
the
fourth
amendment
or
the
rules
of
involuntary
confessions
or
whatever
to
exclude
that
from
the
trial
and
yet
the
judge
knows
all
about
it
and
wouldn't
that
give
him
the
idea
pretty
clearly
that
the
defendant
is
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
situation
and
maybe
it's
pretty
hard
for
a
brooklyn
lawyer
to
realize
this,
but
there
are
many
parts
in
the
united
states
that
are
not
like
kings
county
and
that
do
not
have
many,
many
trial
judges
that
only
have
one
trial
judge.
many
counties
in
the
united
states
have
only
one
trial
judge,
then
that
would
no
longer
be
needless,
it
would
be
a
need.
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
there
is
only
one
though
in
the
whole
county.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
--
there
could
be
under
this
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
way
to
--
the
other
way,
it
might
come
out,
is
to
say,
well
in
that
county
it's
not
needless.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
make
it.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fisher
some,
close
to
20
years
ago,
more
than
15
years
ago
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
a
conviction
on
the
ground
of
a
statement
by
a
trail
judge
in
chicago,
that
it
was
his
practice
and
policy
and
considered
have
it
to
always
give
greater
sentences
to
somebody
who
had
been,
who
had
pleaded
not
guilty
and
then
found
guilty
than
to
those
who
pleaded
guilty.
are
you
familiar
with
that
decision,
well
i
can't
remember
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
you
think
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
although
at
least
in
your
case,
you
have
at
least
according
to
the
defense
counsel
active
participation
in
the
bargaining
by
the
judge
himself
and
a
precise
statement
in
your
case
that
if
he
found
guilty,
after
non-guilty
plea,
you
would
get
the
maximum
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
problem
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
facts
actually
are,
all
we
have
is
that
statement
of
defense
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
the
colloquy
that
you,
to
which
you
call
our
attention
on
page
28
of
the
appendix.
most
of
the
support
for
your
factual
position
comes
from
mr.
bavenzino
(ph).
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
trial
counselor
for
the
defense.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
some
qualified
conformation
of
it
by
the
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
immediately
qualifies
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
he
said
that
is
a
practice
in
my
court
when
there
is
an
armed
robbery
to
give
a
maximum
sentence
unless
there
are
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
potter
stewart
after
a
not-guilty
plea.
justice
potter
stewart
you
certainly
can
at
the
seventh
circuit,
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
may
--
if
not
so
exposed,
he
may
participate
only
as
a
moderator,
not
as
one
of
the
bargainers,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
that
wade
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
conference
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no
mr.
mischel
you
told
us
i
think
that
the
record
does
clearly
show
that
there
was
some
participation
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
in
the
plea
bargaining,
you
told
us
that
didn't
you?
some.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
further
told
us
if
i,
unless
i
misunderstood
or
misheard
you,
that
if
the
petitioner's
counsel
is
correct
in
his
constitutional
claim
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
any
participation
of
the
trail
judge
in
the
plea
bargaining
then
you
lose.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
trail
judge
can't
bring
another
indictment
either
which
bordenkircher
involved.
you
puzzled
me,
but
something
you
said,
you
said
that
assuming
the
facts
as
the
unfavorable
version
of
the
facts
for
your
point
of
view
that
you
would
kind
of
acknowledge
as
a
due
process
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
well
how
does
the
case
as
you
assume
it
to
be
different
from
the
one
the
chief
justice
posed
a
little
while
ago,
that
the
trial
judge
just
announces
that
his
policy
is
to
always
to
impose
the
maximum.
is
that
equally
bad?
justice
potter
stewart
supposing
the
judge
says
that
my
practice
is
--
say
it's
a
20
year
maximum,
he
says
my
practice
in
case
of
this
kind
gets
17
years.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
supposing
he
always
does
and
then
take
one
step
further,
as
the
chief
justice
said
earlier.
and
he
just
doesn't,
every
draft
case
that
man
gets
three
years
or
every
tax
evasion
case
two
years
and
all
the
bar
know
it.
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
then
judge
saying
this
is
policy,
i
think
i'll
follow
and
anybody
if
you
ought
to
know
it,
of
course
there
is
exception
when
there
is
strong
mitigating
circumstance.
how
do
you
differentiate?
and
why
isn't
it
better
for
defendant
to
really
know
what
the
judge
intends
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
says
my
practice
is
always
subject
to
exceptions
and
exceptional
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
which
i
think
he
says
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
what
this
judge
did?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
this
judge
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
legislature
would
be
announced
before
all
trials
that
for
certain
crimes,
there
is
a
mandatory
penalty.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
prosecutor
says
if
you
go
to
trial,
my
recommendation
to
the
trial
judge
is
always
30
years
if
he
is
not
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
a
prosecutor
says,
if
you
go
to
trail
in
armed
robbery
and
you
are
found
guilty,
i
always
recommend
30
years
without
exception.
but
i'm
certainly
willing
to
plea
bargain,
if
you
want.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
the
power
to
impose
it.
