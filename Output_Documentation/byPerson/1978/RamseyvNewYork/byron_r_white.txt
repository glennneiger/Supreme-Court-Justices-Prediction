justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
a
judge
who
at
sentencing
after
a
guilty
plea
of
normally
says
or
announces
that
i
think
it's
only
proper
to
get
consideration,
to
give
leniency,
because
the
person
has
pled
guilty
and
indicated
that
he
is
ready
for
rehabilitation
or
something
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand,
and
so
that
a
lawyer
may
properly
advise
his
client
at
least
this
judge
usually
gives
leniency.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
challenge
that
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
then
he
wouldn't
think
that
any
bargain
that's
been
worked
out
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
counsel
should
be
presented
for
any
kind
of
approval
to
the
judge
who
may
try
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
judge
says,
no
i
don't
know
agree
with
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
he
tried
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
so,
what
if
the
trial
judge
turns
it
down,
and
then
the
defendant
goes
back
and
says
it,
we
do
something
else,
and
then
they
take
it
back
to
the
judge
and
he
agrees
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
knows
that
the
judge
has
simply
said,
if
you
don't
go
for
something
better,
i'm
going
to
try
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
a
state
can
have
an
announced
policy
of
leniency
for
guilty
pleas.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
that's
the
--
otherwise
guilty
plea
systems
would
always
be
unconstitutional
i
suppose.
i
suppose
almost
everywhere
the
prosecutor's
plea
bargain
for
--
on
charges.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is,
you
ask
almost
any
prosecutor
if
he
plea
bargains,
if
he
says
yes,
then
you
say,
“well,
so
you
give,
your
policy
is
to
recognize
leniency,
extend
leniency
exchange
for
guilty
pleas?”
what
was
his
answer,
be
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
almost
everywhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
may
a
state
have
an
announced
policy
of
leniency
for
guilty
pleas
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
of,
the
state,
yes.
the
prosecutor.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
a
judge
say
i
have
a
policy
of
extending
leniency
at
the
time
of
sentencing
for
those
who
have
pled
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
he
must
have
judged
always
--
may
he
say
--
i
agree,
i
approve
this
bargain
you
have
struck
based
on
leniency
for--?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
any
time
under
--
must
you
defend
the
position
that
at
sentencing,
a
judge
may
never
have
a
leniency
for
a
guilty
plea?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i
ask
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
--
i
say,
here
is
a
judge
how
at
sentencing
says,
“my
policy
is
to
give
leniency
for
guilty
pleas,”
that's
all
he
has
ever
said
but
he
says
it
almost
every
time,
and
lawyers
are
--
constantly
tell
their
clients
then
that
this
judge's
policy,
announced
policy
is
to
give
leniency
for
guilty
pleas,
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
he
says,
he
says
in
proper
cases
my
policy
is
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
corbett,
what
about
the
situation
of
corbett?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
went
to
trail,
there
was
no
way
he
could
and
was
found
guilty,
there
was
no
way
he'd
get
a
lesser
sentences
in
the
statute
stated.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
a
flat
rule,
if
you
go
trail
you
have
a
certain
penalty.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
less.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
