justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
prosecutor
offers
to
recommend
a
certain
sentence
to
the
defendant
if
he
pleads
guilty
and
the
defendants
says,
how
do
i
know
what
the
judge
will
do?
your
recommendation
isn't
binding
and
the
prosecutor
says,
well,
if
you
are
agreeable,
we
can
take
it
to
the
judge
and
we
make
it
some
feel
for
how
he
thinks
about
it.
would
you
say
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
the
aba
standard
permits,
what
you
mean
is
that
it
recommends
that
the
states
and
the
federal
government
or
anybody
else
who
might
have
sentencing
authority
ought
to
permit
the
judge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet,
for
purposes
of
state
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
judge's
action
is
every
bit
the
action
of
the
state
in
the
same
sense
as
of
prosecutors,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
burden
of
proof
in
any
case
that
comes
to
this
court
from
the
state
court
where
you
seek
to
upset
a
criminal
convection
on
the
petitioner
of
the
person
who
seeks
to
upset
the
action
of
the
state
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
what
authority
of
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
doesn't
petitioner
have
the
burden
right
now
in
this
court
of
establishing
the
correctness
of
his
contention
in
order
to
establish
the
principle
that
the
proceeding
was
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
if
the
trail
judge
says
to
that,
well,
look,
if
you
got
a
trail,
there
isn't
any
statute.
if
you
got
a
trial,
you
are
going
to
get
x,
that's
i
always
just
armed
robbery,
i
always
give
30
years
that's
just
the
way
i
did.
but,
if
you
plead
guilty,
i
may
give
you
less.
i
could
give
you
30
years,
but
i
may
give
you
less
and
you
have
just
said
that
is
unconstitutional,
but
that's
the
only
difference
between
--
what
i've
just
said
in
corbett
is
that
the
30
years
isn't
a
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
one
are
you
going
to
retreat
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
need
to
answer
right
now.
