justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
will
go
out
of
order
if
we
may
until
more
of
our
colleagues
arrive.
and
here
first
the
case
77-6540
harold
ramsey
versus
new
york.
mr.
fisher,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fisher,
before
you
continue
you
had
told
us
just
a
moment
ago
that
ordinarily
in
king's
county
plea
negotiations
are
conducted
at
bench
conferences
of
which
no
record
is
made.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
apply
that
it's
quite
usual
for
judges
to
participate
in
the
negotiations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
i
gather
is
that
it's
always
improper
for
the
judge
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
to
what
extent
would
you
suggest
the
judge
has
any
role
in
the
file?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
judge
here
will
sentence
the
man
if
he
pleads
not
guilty,
but
is
found
guilty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
fair
to
say
mr.
mischel
and
i
expect
you,
i
think
i
know
what
your
answer
is
going
to
be
since
what
you
have
just
told
us,
that
it's
not
at
all
clear
from
this
record
or
from
what
part
of
the
record
is
in
the
appendix.
what
happened
in
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
so,
but
you
concede
that
that
is
not
at
all
clear.
