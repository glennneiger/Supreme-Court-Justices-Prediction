chief

you
used
a
phrase,
needless
guilty
pleas
and
i'm
not
sure
i
know
what
you
mean
by
some
of
jackson
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
think
it
means,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
a
judge
assigned
or
a
district
where
he
is
not
regularly
sitting,
so
that
his
habits
are
not
known,
announces
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
when
they
the
call
the
criminal
calendar
that
all
persons
who
are
tied
and
found
guilty
will
get
the
maximum
sentence
permitted
by
the
statute.
do
you
think
that
has
a
tendency
to
encouragement
guilty
pleas
by
people
who
make
a
judgment
that
they
are
likely
to
be
found
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it's
bad?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
jackson
prohibits
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
if
instead
of
announcing
it,
particular
judge
by
long
habits
communicates
to
the
entire
bar
and
practicing
in
that
court,
that
that's
what
in
fact
he
does
but
he
doesn't
articulate
that
is
his
standard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
there
are
any
advantages
to
the
category
of
defendants
as
a
class
versus
charge
that
the
candor
of
the
judge
gives
them
much
better
working
basis
for
making
a
decision.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
mischel.
he
has
taken
a
long
time
to
get
there.
mr.
mischel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
a
no
distinction
in
the
jackson
and
(inaudible)
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
might
be
one
rule
about
a
case
as
jackson
is
relating
to
the
specter
of
death
sentence
and
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
apply
that
same
concept
to
a
matter
of
two
or
three
years
more
or
less.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
a
minute,
you
and
your
friend
too
have
referred
from
time-to-time
to
the
american
bar
association
reports
that
cover
this
area,
several
of
them
and
they
might
have
or
rather
sweeping
concessions
you
seem
to
be
made
--
i
wonder
if
you
are
aware
that
in
everyone
of
those
reports
the
american
bar
pointedly
said,
they
were
not
addressing
the
constitutional
question
with
nearly
good
sound
practice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
none
of
those
were
suggesting
a
constitutional
question
in
this
problem.
is
that,
are
you
aware
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
approaching
this
from
--
the
observation
that
i
was
making
from
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
namely
that
even
when
they
recommended
something
was
a
desirable
practice.
it
expressly,
disclaimed
any
notion
that
failure
to
follow
that
--
desirable
practice
would
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
number
6540,
ramsey
against
the
state
of
new
york
and
for
reason
stated
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
filed
with
the

this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
