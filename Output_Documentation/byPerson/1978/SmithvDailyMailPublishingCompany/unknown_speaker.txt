unknown
speaker
the
statute
doesn’t
make
any
distinction
between
the
case
where
it’s
common
knowledge
and
one
where
it’s
not,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
that’s
a
criminal
statute,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
general
hanley,
this
i’m
sure
i
understand
your
point,
is
it
your
view
that
there
is
no
claim
is
there
that
the
newspaper
violated
any
law
in
obtaining
the
information?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
obtained?
unknown
speaker
what
else
do
we
need?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hanley,
help
me
out
a
little
bit,
what
are
the
state
interests
that
are
being
served?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
my
next
question
is
why
are
radio
and
television
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
your
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
just
a
matter
of
regulation
as
much
as
it
is
just
the
imposition
of
a
criminal
statute.
let
me
put
in
other
way,
do
you
think
there’s
a
prior
restraint
involve
here?
unknown
speaker
you’re
conceding
that
there
might
be
a
prior
restraint
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
any
statute
there
is
a
threat.
unknown
speaker
or
libel
statute
is
a
threat.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn’t
prevent
anyone
from
publishing
something
libelous.
he
is
liable,
i
believe
he
does.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
your
opposition
takes
the
position
that’s
prior
restraint,
maybe
i
should
ask
him.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn’t
landmark
help
or
hinder
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
an
opposition
to
you
particularly,
but
the
other
side
of
that
coin
is
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
whose
committing
crimes
thereon?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
the
constitution
have
to
do
something?
unknown
speaker
on
the
constitutional
sense,
does
the
public
have
a
right
to
know
anything
as
individuals
that
say
a
newspaper
or
television
station
doesn’t
choose
to
print
or
that
their
neighbors
don’t
choose
to
tell
them?
unknown
speaker
is
it
against
the
law
in
your
state
for
a
police
officer
or
judge
to
tell
him
the
press
who
committed
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
that
isn’t
quite
what
i
asked
you.
say
he
does
--
is
it
against
the
law
for
police
officer
or
judge
to
tell
the
press
who
committed
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
and
--
but
you
say
that
no
matter
how
the
press
learns
it,
the
statute
would
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
absent
and
order
permitting
the
publication.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
that
all
you’re
saying
is
that
the
statute
would
be
invalid
if
it
was
applied.
but
the
statute
on
its
face
seems
to
cover
the
--
unknown
speaker
general
hanley
on
that
point,
do
you
say
that
the
explanation
of
the
exclusion
for
radio
and
tv
is
they
are
regulated
by
the
federal
communications
commission?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
federal
regulation
that
prohibits
them
from
publishing
the
name
of
juvenile?
unknown
speaker
so
in
practical
effect
to
say
they
really
are
--
all
the
media
are
treated
the
same
but
if
you
look
at
the
entire
statute
--
unknown
speaker
on
page
31
of
the
respondent’s
brief
in
the
footnote.
unknown
speaker
do
you
happen
to
know
when
the
west
virginia
statute
was
passed?
unknown
speaker
so
its
limitation
to
the
press
is
fully
explainable
just
by
the
--
unknown
speaker
at
the
time
there
was
no
television
and
very
little
radio?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
abrams,
--
unknown
speaker
--
going
back
to
the
aba
recommendation,
is
it
your
view
that
a
statute
making
it
a
crime
for
a
court
aide
or
some
kind
of
clerk
or
something
like
that
to
reveal
information
like
this
be
constitutional?
you
suggested
--
unknown
speaker
and
they
would
apply
let's
say
also
prohibition
against
the
police
for
revealing
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
abrams,
can
i
go
back
once
more
at
the
aba
--
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
statute
could
not
prohibit
a
victim
or
family
of
a
victim
from
telling
the
press
who
the
young
man
under
suspicion
was?
unknown
speaker
so
isn't
that
all
that's
going
be
true
that
the
information
would
be
obtainable
probably,
potentially
available.
unknown
speaker
well,
general
even
if
–
even
if
it
was
common
knowledge,
the
statute
would
cover
it,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
wherever
it
was
common
knowledge,
if
it
was
common
knowledge
in
charleston
or
anywhere
else,
the
statute
would
forbid
the
publication?
unknown
speaker
and
to
that
extent
it,
the
statute
is
at
the
very
minimum
would
be
overbroad,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
a
statute
may
validly
forbid
the
publication
of
the
juvenile's
name
where
the
name
is
common
knowledge
in
the
community?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
general
hanley,
just
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what
has
happened
to
this
minor?
unknown
speaker
is
he
incarcerated?
he's
free,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
going
to
school?
