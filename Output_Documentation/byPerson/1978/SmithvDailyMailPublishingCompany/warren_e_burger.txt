chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
stewart.
we’ll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
482,
robert
k.
smith
against
the
daily
mail
publishing
company.
mr.
hanley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
a
statute
is
a
threat,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
rely
or
to
what
extent
if
you
do
rely
on
the
fact
that
step
by
step,
criminal
conducts
of
juveniles
has
been
treated
by
the
court
in
terms
of
procedure
and
prosecution
to
be
more
and
more
like
the
prosecution
of
adult
crime
except
for
a
jury
and
a
few
other
factors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
operative
effect,
mr.
hanley,
the
statute
gives
the
judge
the
opportunity
to
--
gives
the
judge
the
power
to
decide
whether
there
shall
be
or
shall
not
be
publication,
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
happens
to
the
underlying
--
what
happens
to
the
underlying
proposition
of
the
juvenile
must
be
protected
even
from
public
knowledge
when
the
judge
can
waive
it?
the
judge
can
waive
it
theoretically
in
every
case,
couldn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
mean
the
particular
judge
could
wipe
out
the
statute
if
he
wanted
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mary
abrams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
abrams,
i
noticed
that
you
put,
at
least
you
put
a
good
deal
of
weight
on
the
fact
that
between
1960
and
1975,
as
we
all
know
has
been
an
enormous
increase
in
juvenile
crime,
serious
violent
crime.
now,
suppose
the
statistics
were
the
other
way?
suppose
it
showed
that
juvenile
crime
was
going
down,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
constitutional
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
irrelevant,
isn't
it
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
explains
your
answers
why
you're
not
sure
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
there,
if
it
all
on
your
case
that
tendency
over
the
last
dozen
years
more
or
less
has
been
to
assimilate
procedure
for
juvenile
prosecutions
if
there
to
be
called
juvenile
procedures
to
the
full
panoply
of
criminal
procedures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
a
consideration
primarily
for
the
legislature
rather
than
for
judges?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
they
didn't
so?
suppose
mr.
abrams
that
there
weren't
seven
eyewitnesses,
indeed
no
eyewitness
and
that
he
was
apprehended
on
some
circumstantial
evidence,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
issue
wasn't
presented
in
the
landmark
case,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
this
picture
that's
in
the
appendix
had
been
published
without
the
name,
is
that
a
violation
of
the
statute?
would
it
be
functionally
equivalent
of
identifying
the
juvenile
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
hanley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
