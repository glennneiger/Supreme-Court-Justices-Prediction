so
an
even
rigorous
prohibition
would
not
be
a
prior
restraint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
if
the
paper
here
it
simply
chosen
to
abide
the
statute
and
not
seek
permission
and
say,
weâ€™re
prohibited
as
the
editorial
indicated
they
were
from
publishing,
it
would
have
the
same
effect
as
the
criminal
statute
and
not
the
prior
restraint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
read
some
of
our
cases
indicating
that
a
prior
restraint
is
the
most
onerous
of
all
prohibitions
against
publication
and
i
take
it
from
your
answer
to
my
brother
stewart
and
my
own
question
that
that
isn't
necessary
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
most
jargonic.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
prior,
prior
restraint
statutes
aren't
the
most
severe
repressions
of
publication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
wouldn't
a
flat
ban
be
even
worse?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
a
newspaper
more
you
have
a
particular
significance
say
10
years
after
the
event,
the
state
can
close
the
juvenile
record
but
some
reporter
can
go
into
a
--
into
a
newspaper
more
10
years
later
and
say
so
and
so
age
25
was
proceeded
against
a
juvenile
10
years
ago,
if
the
proceedings
against
him
were
dismissed
and
because
of
the
story
was
reported
in
the
newspaper
and
that
would
be
the
only
source
of
information
you
would
have.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
destruction
of
arrest
records
legislation
isn't
to
be
very
useful
if
a
person
can
go
to
the
newspaper
morgue
and
find
out
the
fact
of
arrest
from
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
didn't
constitute
a
constitutional
amendment,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
well
we
have
a
case
out
here
not
long
ago
in
vienna
where
there
was
a
family
killing
and
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
who
was
apprehended
for
juvenile
proceeding
but
the
press
was
very
unhappy
and
presumably
other
people
may
have
been.
they
were
simply
unable
to
find
out
about
what
transpired
at
the
closed
juvenile
hearing.
would
your
argument
extend
that
far?
