justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
doesn’t
care
how
you
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
is
that
material?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
in
the
case
of
--
we
were
the
other
side
was
attacking
the
statute
like
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
seems
to
me
the
only
thing
we
need
in
this
case
is
that
the
newspaper
published
the
name
of
the
juvenile?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
beside
on
constituting
that
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
don’t
need
anymore
facts,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
need
now
is
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
you
are
getting
ready
to
get
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
rather
quick.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
newspaper’s
call?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
are
we
interested
in
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
to
draw
the
influence
if
the
newspapers
are
holding
this
case
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you’re
going
to
drop
a
little
on
the
newspaper,
didn’t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
see
how
we
can.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
don’t
we
talk
in
law
in
this
case
as
still
all
this
experience
now?
i
mean
in
all
deference,
you
say
this
is
the
first
case
of
this
kind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
involves
the
first
amendment
which
is
important.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
why
don’t
we
get
to
the
law
and
that’s
all
it’s
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
that
case
say
that
the
radio,
the
television,
and
anybody
else
could
print
it
but
the
newspaper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn’t
that
one
of
the
points
that’s
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
agree
that
we
can
uphold
the
court
on
any
ground?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
if
we
affirm
on
the
first
amendment,
we
don’t
have
to
get
to
the
fourteenth,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
we
don’t
affirm
on
the
first,
can’t
we
get
to
the
fourteenth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
misunderstood.
if
you
violate,
if
a
juvenile
violates
a
state
law,
can
it
publish
it
on
the
radio?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
as
far
as
the
federal
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
federal
statute
can?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
radio
and
television
do
you
think
the
general
was
relying
on
applies
to
federal
juvenile?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
only
that
applies.
but
it
doesn't
apply
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
this
one
that
says
you
can't
publish
any
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
that
applies
to
a
federal
juvenile
hearing,
the
united
states
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
all
throughout
the
country,
i
thought
there
are
only
five
or
six
states
in
interstate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
say
that
that
will
affect
the
whole
country?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
only
thing
we
have
before
us
is
the
statute?
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
applies
to
federal
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
relation
does
that
have
to
with
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
know
why
the
federal
government
could
do
it
or
not?
and
i
won't
be
able
to
know
until
the
case
involved
here
comes
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
one
is
here.
