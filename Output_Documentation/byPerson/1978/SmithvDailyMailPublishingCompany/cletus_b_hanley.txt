mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
which
on
february
9,
1978,
a
shooting
occurred
in
the
city
of
st.
albans,
west
virginia,
that’s
about
12
miles
from
charleston,
the
capital
city
and
it’s
in
a
metropolitan
area
there
at
west
virginia,
(inaudible).
it
was
about
250,000
people.
and
a
14-year-old
boy
was
apprehended
and
taken
into
custody.
later
on
that
day,
a
juvenile
hearing
was
held
and
he
was
declared
a
delinquent
under
our
west
virginia
law.
it’s
against
the
statute
of
west
virginia
for
a
newspaper
to
print
the
name
of
a
juvenile
who
was
under
arrest
or
pending
a
hearing.
on
the
next
day,
on
february
10th,
the
charleston
gazette,
a
statewide
newspaper
in
west
virginia
published
the
name
of
the
juvenile
on
the
front
page
along
with
a
picture.
and
also,
an
editorial
made
comment
that
they
were
deliberately
doing
this.
they
were
the
gazette,
wait
a
minute,
then
the
daily
mail,
an
afternoon
newspaper,
published
the
name
that
afternoon.
these
--
both
of
these
newspapers
along
with
the
editors
and
reporters
were
indicted
by
a
kanawha
county
grand
jury
later
on
in
the
month.
before
trial
could
be
held,
the
newspapers
sought
provision
in
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
and
a
rule
was
issued
on
both
newspapers.
separate
rules
were
issued
on
both
newspapers
putting
the
case
before
our
supreme
court
for
argument.
the
cases
were
then
consolidated
for
arguments
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
mainly
today
that
these
cases,
the
fact
situations
are
different.
in
the
gazette
case,
they
alleged
in
their
petition
that
it
was
already
common
knowledge
when
they
printed
this
juvenile’s
name.
in
the
answer
of
the
state,
it
was
denied
that
this
was.
the
gazette
newspaper
then
demurred
to
the
answer
so
for
all
practical
purposes,
they
were
then
saying
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
it
was
not
common
knowledge.
and
the
information
was
not
obtained
from
any
other
source
from
hearing
or
from
assistant
prosecuting
attorney
which
i
noted
in
the
brief,
it
now
says
that
it’s
in
prosecuting
attorney.
so
the
bare
issue
then
is
whether
a
newspaper
may
print
the
name
of
a
juvenile
when
they
sought
the
information
and
obtained
it
on
their
own.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
your
honor.
however
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
however,
the
--
i
want
to
point
that
out
because
of
the
past
case
law
of
this
court
indicating
where
the
information
is
obtained
by
court
records
as
in
the
cox
case
where
the
information
is
obtained
at
a
public
hearing
the
nebraska
case
or
when
the
information
is
obtained
in
a
closed
hearing
where
the
court
allowed
the
press
in.
that
one
makes
a
big
distinction
so
what
i’m
saying
to
the
court,
this
is
a
case
now
of
first
impression
and
it’s
not
a
case
of
a
fitting
in
with
the
cox
or
nebraska
or
the
oklahoma
case.
if
the
case
fits
in
for
anything,
it
fits
in
with
the
virgin
island
case.
of
course
that’s
our
contention
this
is
the
reasoning
in
the
(inaudible)
case
should
be
adopted
by
this
court.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
no,
we’re
not
contending
they
violated
any
law
in
obtaining
it.
all
we’re
saying
is
they
printed
it.
we
are
saying,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
is
that
the
information
was
not
obtained
in
a
court
hearing
or
court
record
as
in
the
cox,
nebraska,
or
oklahoma
cases.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
it
was.
by
let’s
say
there
own
investigation
so
far.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
sir.
the
statute
doesn’t
care.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
it’s
material
because
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
or
we
say
it’s
material.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
sir.
the
case,
the
court
in
those
cases
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
we
don’t
need
anything.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
i’m
saying,
your
honor
that
you
don’t
need
anything.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
sir.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
hopefully.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
the
--
we’re
asking
this
court
to
adopt
the
reasoning
at
least
in
the
virgin
island
case
where
they
balance
the
right
of
a
juvenile
as
against
the
first
amendment
rights
of
a
newspaper
and
upheld
the
rights
of
a
juvenile.
when
we
speak
of
freedom
of
the
press,
i
wonder
what
are
we
speaking
of.
i
say,
it’s
the
right
of
an
editor
that
owns
the
newspaper
or
the
owner
of
the
editor
to
print
almost
anything
he
wants
to.
and
the
only
recourse
that
anyone
has
is,
if
it’s
a
private
person
by
libel
suit
and
since
the
sullivan
case
of
new
york
times
versus
sullivan,
it’s
pretty
hard.
this
court
has
a
check
and
balance
as
against
the
legislative
branch
of
government,
as
against
the
executive
branch
of
government
but
how
far
does
this
court
going
to
go
to
protect
the
rights
of
a
newspaper
in
the
first
amendment.
we
say
that
it’s
going
too
far
to
say
that
the
country
must
be
in
dire
need
or
war
or
something
of
that
kind
and
we’re
saying
that
this
cox
case
in
this
later
cases
in
this
court
indicate
that
they
don’t
intend
to
go
that
far.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
the
state
interests
that
are
being
served
are
to
protect
juveniles.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
your
honor,
it’s
excluded
because
that
is
regulated
by
the
federal
government,
the
fcc
regulates
them
and
i
can
point
an
analogy
to
that.
in
our
state,
if
a
person
files
and
runs
for
office,
and
an
advertisement
is
placed
in
the
newspaper,
it’s
against
the
law
not
to
say
who
paid
for
the
ad.
but
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
radio
or
television.
however,
the
fcc
controls
that
and
will
not
let
them
place
an
ad
without
telling
who
paid
for
it.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
your
honor,
we’re
saying
that
if
there
is
a
prior
restraint,
the
right
for
the
juvenile
should
be
balanced
ahead
of
such
restraint
and
the
rights
of
a
juvenile
should
be
protected.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir,
i
am.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
if
you
compare
it
for
instance
with
the
landmark
case
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
i
would
say
it
would
be
a
prior
restraint.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
that’s
true,
your
honor.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
i
have
been
confused
in
the
--
frankly,
i’ve
been
confused
in
reading
the
cases
on
prior
restraint.
for
instance,
the
landmark
case,
it
says
that’s
not
a
prior
restraint.
that’s
my
reading
of
it
and
i
want
to
mention
that
case.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
of
course
the
opposition
is
going
to
say
it
hinders
me
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
case
was
attempting
to
protect
the
judiciary
and
this
court
said
that
the
judiciary
does
not
need
protect
him
and
that
the
people
are
entitled
to
know
what
the
judiciaries
are
doing
and
what
i’m
saying
is
juveniles,
it’s
a
separate
thing
all
over
this
country.
most
states
have
some
method
and
some
statutes
to
protect
juveniles
and
to
rehabilitate
them
and
not
to
treat
them
as
criminals.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
of
course
the
newspaper
is
not
clearly
prohibited.
they
can
print
all
about
the
instant.
they
want
to,
they
just
can’t
print
the
name
and
i
might
say
the
flagrancy
and
deliberateness,
and
arrogance,
it
was
demonstrated
in
this
editorial.
it
show
how
far
the
newspaper
goes
if
somebody
thence
--
if
somebody
doesn’t
do
something
to
balance
that
out.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
your
honor,
i
don’t
--
i
think
it’s
a
question
of
interpretation
and
i
think
this
court
has
not
decided
that
question
because
this
court
also
thought
that
maybe
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
just
say
a
prior
restraint
is
forbidden
absolutely.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
of
course
when
the
newspaper
don’t
choose
to
print
it,
they
won’t
do
it.
i
don’t
know
about
that
part,
your
honor,
but
it’s
just
a
question
if
you
want
to
protect
the
juveniles
and
most
of
the
thinking
throughout
the
country
is
that
we
do.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
your
honor,
the
statute
provides.
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
the
statute
provides
that
the
judge
may
order
--
may
allow
by
order
may
allow
the
newspaper
to
print.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
sir,
absolutely
not.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
i
don’t
your
honor,
because
of
the
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
i
don’t
your
honor,
because
from
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
that’s
true,
that’s
absolutely
true.
this
court
has
not
stuck
a
statute
as
such
down
as
yet
in
that
regard.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
your
honor,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
this.
i
think
that
the
court
is
giving
a
juvenile
double
protection.
they
are
giving
them
the
same
rights
as
an
adult
and
also
the
rights
of
a
juvenile.
not
just
giving
him
the
rights
of
an
adult
and
taking
away
the
rights
of
a
juvenile.
but
now
they
received
both
rights.
the
right
to
be
treated
as
a
juvenile
and
also
have
the
same
rights
as
an
adult
as
to
attorney,
have
an
attorney
and
given
the
rights
and
so
forth.
in
this
particular
case,
this
juvenile
has
not
been
tried
yet
for
this
alleged
crime.
it’s
my
understanding
that
he
has
a
good
defense
to
this
alleges
act
of
murder.
he
has
not
had
a
chance
to
have
his
day
in
court
as
yet.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
it’s
not
the
newspaper.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
i
just
want
to
point
it
out
that
he
hasn’t
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
it
didn’t
happen,
your
honor.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
i
thought
so.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
you
can’t
but
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
your
honor,
then
if
--
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
i
think
the
reasoning
in
the
virgin
island
case
fits
this
case
on
all
force
that
in
the
court
in
that
case
indicated
that
the
balance,
the
right
to
preserve
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
sir.
but
your
honor
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
no,
that’s
not
before
you.
i
say
that’s
not
before
you.
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
in
this
case
because
it
wasn’t
decided
in
the
court
below.
that
is
brought
up
for
the
first
time
up
here.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
i
would
suggest
that
possibly,
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
i
would
suggest
and
argue
that
i
don’t
think
the
court
should
get
to
the
fourteenth.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
your
honor,
yes,
there
is.
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
prohibits
publishing
a
juvenile’s
name
just
like
the
statute
in
west
virginia.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
as
far
as
the
federal
statute
is
concerned,
yes,
sir.
i
don’t
want
to
misrepresent.
there
is
a
federal
statute,
that
is,
i
assume
that
means
that
if
there
is
a
federal
law
violated
by
juvenile,
they
cannot
print
his
name,
the
press
nor
the
media
or
any
of
the
media.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
that’s
a
federal
law,
your
honor.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
as
far
as
the
state
statute,
yes?
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
i
don’t
know
whether
there’s
any
--
i
don’t
think
there
is
a
regulation
against
it
but
they
can
regulate
it
and
i
don’t
point
that
it
be
proper
for
the
state
to
regulate
the
tv
and
radio.
i
don’t
think
there’s
no
pace
that
i
could
find
it
or
that’s
been
determined
but
there’s
certainly
as
a
federal
statute
preventing
the
juvenile
so
it
indicates
the
federal
government,
thanks
that
they
can
protect
the
juvenile.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
the
past
years,
they
have
done
that
right
along
as
sort
of
a
routine
but
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
but
under
the
now
and
old
juvenile
--
most
juvenile
laws,
the
judge
was
considered
the
parens
patriae
of
the
child
and
assuming
that
--
we
assume
that
the
judge
would
do
a
better
job
than
some
newspaper
or
some
stranger
will
be
acquainted
with
these
things,
with
these
matters.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
not
offhand,
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
been
on
the
books
about
30
years.
it’s
been
at
least
that
long.
i
think
one
of
the,
i
read
one
of
the
amicus
brief
and
it
indicated
that
it
was
a
40-year
statute.
thank
you.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
i
just
like
to
make
a
few
--
point
out
few
things.
if
your
honors
please,
regardless
of
whether
this
is
considered
a
prior
restraint
or
not,
i'm
not
conceding
that
it
is
or
it
isn't.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i'm
asking
this
court
to
follow
the
view
and
reasoning
in
the
virgin
island
case.
in
that
case,
they
said
it
was
a
prior
restraint.
they
said
that
the
rights
of
the
juvenile
outweighed
the
first
amendment.
counsel
has
brought
up
again
the
fact
that
this
one
common
knowledge
and
i'm
requesting
the
court
to
consider
only
the
petition
and
pleadings
in
the
gazette
case
because
this
case
was
consolidated
under
two
separate
sets
of
facts.
the
daily
mail
obtained
more
facts
i
suppose
because
they
came
to,
they
printed
later.
but
in
the
gazette
case,
the
petition
says
that
--
their
petition
says
that
they
obtained
the
knowledge
from
a
policeman
and
i
imagine
that
so.
but
we
don't
concede
for
a
minute
that
this
was
common
knowledge
and
this
place
where
the
shooting
occurred
is
about
13
miles
from
charleston
that
is
one
big
metropolitan
area.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
if
it
was
common
knowledge
out
there,
it
wouldn't
be
common
knowledge
in
the
community
which
is
charleston
and
that's
where
the
boy
is
going
to
be
tried.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
but
we
do
not
concede
it.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
think
it
could.
yes,
but
we
don't
concede
that
it
was
common
knowledge
at
all.
and
there's
no
evidence
taken
here,
that's
my
point
there's
been
no
evidence
taken
in
this
case
and
yet
counsel
for
the
other
side
says
it's
common
knowledge
and
they
got
the
information
here
and
got
the
information
there.
we
don't
concede
that
and
if
the
court
raised
the
pleadings
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes.
in
the
cox
case,
this
court
said
we
reaffirm
that
the
guarantees
that's
the
first
amendment
guarantees
are
not
an
absolute
prohibition
under
all
circumstances
but
the
barriers
to
prior
restraint
remain
high
and
the
presumption
against
each
use
continues
intact.
well,
we
concede
that
but
we're
saying
that
the
--
this
is
a
barrier.
this
is
under
the
holding
of
the
virgin
island
case,
it's
important;
this
court
could
destroy
the
whole
juvenile
system
throughout
the
country
if
it
doesn't
protect
the
juvenile
in
this
instance.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
because
--
for
this
reason
your
honor.
i'm
not
talking
about
a
similar
type
statute.
i'm
talking
about
juvenile
programs.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
the
federal
act
goes
to
all
media,
i
just
read
it
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
only.
yes,
sir,
federal
cases
only.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
in
this
regard,
your
honor.
it's
an
analogy
if
the
federal
government
can
do
it,
why
couldn't
the
state
government
do
it?
that's
the
only
reason
that
it
applies.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
well,
--
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
yes,
sir.
and
we
are
arguing
that
as
an
analogy
at
least,
we
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
virgin
island
ruling
in
holding
in
that
case.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
he's
still
pending
trial.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
i
think
he's
out
on
bond,
your
honor,
i
believe.
mr.
cletus
b.
hanley
i
don't
know.
i
have
no
idea.
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing,
that
at
the
close
of
the
year,
that
this
newspaper
published
the
story
of
the
year
and
published
the
story
of
this
boy's
troubles
again
and
called
it
a
story
of
the
year
and
printed
his
name
again,
while
this
case
was
pending.
thank
you.
