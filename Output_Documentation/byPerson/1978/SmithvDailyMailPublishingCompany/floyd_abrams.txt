mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
like
to
respond
very
briefly
to
one
or
two
questions
which
were
asked
of
general
hanley
before
proceeding
to
my
argument.
the
statute
was
adopted
in
1915
in
west
virginia.
it
is
64
years
old,
as
far
as
we
know
this
is
the
first
prosecution
under
it
against
any
newspaper.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
it
was
adopted
at
a
time
when
the
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
and
at
the
time
when
the
first
amendment
did
not
apply
to
the
states
as
well.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
statutory
language
as
of
1915
is
very
similar
as
to
what
is
it
today.
it
said,
nor
shall
the
name
of
any
child
in
connection
with
any
proceeding
under
this
act
be
published
in
any
newspaper
without
a
written
order
of
the
court.
i
shall
like
to
proceed
first
to
the
question
of
whether
this
statute
is
indeed
a
prior
restraint.
as
i
understand,
general
hanley,
he
has
conceded
or
but
conceded
that
it
is
that
i
think
it
is
a
matter
which
is
for
the
court
to
decide,
of
course.
it
is
not
a
prior
restraint
because
it
is
a
threat.
all
criminal
statutes
directed
at
the
press
threats
the
landmark
statute
was
a
threat
and
it
was
not
a
prior
restraint.
it
is
a
prior
restraint
in
our
view
because
the
essence
of
it
and
the
essence
of
the
crime
alleged
here
is
that
you
must
seek
written
permission
of
the
judge
before
you
can
print
the
name
of
the
child.
that
in
our
view
is
what
makes
it
a
prior
restraint.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
it
would
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
would
not
be
a
prior
restraint
statute
in
our
view
then.
it
would
be
a
straight
subsequent
punishment,
a
criminal
statute
to
be
judged
as
you
judge
against
first
amendment
interest
and
first
amendment
claims,
criminal
statutes
which
affect
or
directly
implicate
the
rights
of
the
press.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
often
the
case
in
terms
of
licensing
statute,
sir.
i
mean
if
a
license
--
if
instead
of
a
licensing
statute,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
have
a
flat
ban
on
any
kind
of
publication,
i
there
say
it
would
likely
be
unconstitutional
but
it
wouldn’t
be
a
prior
restraint.
and
the
fact
that
the
essence
of
this
crime
as
alleged
and
as
the
essence
of
this
misdemeanor
which
can
lead
to
six
months
jail
sentences
here
is
not
obtaining
the
permission
of
the
court
in
printing
without
that
permission
in
our
view
next
is
a
prior
restraint
and
a
far
more
classic
sense
than
most
of
the
prior
restraint
cases
which
this
court
has
had
in
recent
years.
far
more
than
pentagon
papers
or
the
nebraska
press
association
case,
far
more
than
near
itself.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
the
paper
would
have
been
able
to
defend
and
indeed
if
this
criminal
case
proceeds
would
be
able
to
defend
on
the
grounds
that
permission
wasn’t
needed
but
the
essence
is
i
understand
it.
one
of
the
things
that's
wrong
with
prior
restraint
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
it
establishes
a
censorial
authority
with
a
relationship
to
the
censored
entity
which
is
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
has
indicated
it
doesn't
like
that
it's
particularly
low
to
accept
in
prior
restraint
statutes.
now,
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
is
on
its
face
anomalous
to
say
that
because
there
is
this
provision
in
the
statute
which
says
that
you
can
go
to
a
court
and
get
permission,
that
that
makes
it
a
prior
restraint.
but
in
our
view
that,
that
is
always
what
licensing
statutes
have.
it
is
precisely
that
provision
which
brings
into
account
the
essential
prior
restraint
relationship
of
the
censored
to
the
party
who
is
doing
the
censoring,
but
you
have
to
go
and
ask
permission.
mr.
floyd
abrams
absolutely,
mr.
just
stewart.
i
was
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
only
makes
difference
in
terms
of
how
you
choose
to
analyze
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
is
so
clearly
unconstitutional
for
a
variety
of
reasons
that
whether
or
not
it
is
a
prior
restraint
or
a
subsequent
punishment
statute
that
would
be
just
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
prior
restraints
by
their
nature
are
the
most
jargonic
restraints
upon
speech,
that
doesn't
mean
that
subsequent
punishment
statute
in
a
particular
case
doesn't
fall
on
speech
with
even
greater
brutality.
professor
chaffee
once
wrote
that
if
there
were
capital
punishment
for
the
advocacy
of
socialism
that
that
would
have
pretty
chilling
effect.
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
would
have
more
of
the
chilling
effect
on
advocacy
of
socialism
than
this
prior
restraint
statute
would.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
you
do
have
an
established
body
of
law
of
a
view
of
prior
restraints,
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
a
prior
restraint
statute
and
that
that
body
of
law
ought
to
be
the
overview
with
which
you
look
at
the
statute.
mr.
floyd
abrams
prior
restraint
statute
this
court
has
indicated
time
and
again
are
to
be
viewed
with
the
particular
harshness
by
this
court
to
see
if
there
is
an
exception
which
allows
the
statute
to
stand.
this
court
is
indicator
as
i
understand
all
of
its
prior
restraint
rulings
that
prior
restraints
are
presumptively
unconstitutional
unlike
other
statutes
that
prior
restraints
where
a
heavy
burden
unlike
certain
other
statutes.
i
don't
--
as
justice
stewart
suggest,
i
don't
have
to
persuade
you.
i
think
that
is
a
prior
restraint
but
if
it
is
it
seems
to
me
that
your
cases
lead
you
to
analyze
a
legal
question
in
a
somewhat
different
way.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
flat
ban
may
be
even
worse
just
as
a
flat
ban
on
publication
of
all
literature
by
the
king
of
england
would
have
been
worse
than
sending
people
to
the
censorial
authority
to
get
permission
to
print.
nonetheless,
we
have
a
body
of
law
which
says
the
prior
restraints
because
of
the
effects
that
they
have
are
particularly
presumptively
unconstitutional.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
it
would
not
mr.
chief
justice.
i
simply
indicated
that
to
indicate
to
you
why
the
press
might
want
to
print
as
a
matter
of
information
for
the
court
but
that
is
not
the
heart
of
our
argument.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
irrelevant
as
to
the
legal
position
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
it
is
simply
suggested
to
you
since
i
thought
you've
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
and
that's
the
only
reason
that
it's
there.
entirely
size
from
the
question
if
it
is
a
question
of
whether
this
is
a
prior
restraint
it
must
meet
those
harsh
standards.
it's
our
view
that
this
statute
cannot
meet
any
first
amendment
test.
this
court
has
indicated
but
it
seems
to
us
whatever
greater
clarity
in
recent
years,
the
proposition
articulated
last
term
by
the
chief
justice
in
the
houchins
versus
kqed
case
but
the
government
may
not
restrain
communications
or
whatever
information
the
media
acquires
and
which
they
elected
to
reveal.
that
proposition
reflected
an
opinion
such
as
tornillo
and
a
variety
of
others
by
this
court,
is
in
our
view
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
statute
which
bars
the
next
criminal.
precisely,
the
publication
of
what
the
press
has
learned
and
chooses
to
print.
it
is
a
core
first
amendment
interests
in
our
view
which
cannot
give
way
even
to
societal
interests
at
least
as
great
as
those
which
are
asserted
here.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
under
this
statute,
as
general
hanley
has
conceded,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
the
press
learns
the
information.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
in
this
case
for
example
on
what
i
take
to
be
the
admitted
facts
of
this
case
that
this
was
a
killing
in
a
public
school
which
there
were
seven
eyewitnesses
and
that
entirely
aside
from
the
question
of
who
gave
the
information
to
the
press
and
on
this
record
i
think
it
is
admitted
that
it
the
information
came
from
police
authorities,
that
this
community
was
filled
with
eyewitnesses
that
knew
what
happened
there.
general
hanley
rightly
and
candidly
concedes
to
you
that
that
makes
no
difference
if
the
statute
still
applies
but
it
seems
to
us
that
to
put
that
kind
of
onus
on
the
press
to
say
that
there
will
be
no
punishment
of
the
police,
to
say
that
the
statute
does
not
even
apply
to
the
police
but
to
say
that
there
will
be
no
punishment
of
anyone
else
and
no
other
efforts
made
of
a
meaningful
sort
not
even
an
effort
made
if
this
state
interests
is
so
great
to
ban
magazines,
let
alone
newspapers,
radio
and
television
but
to
ban
individuals
from
repeating
these
things.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
the
statute
cites
it.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
it
allowed
the
law
of
course
as
the
one
example
where
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
right,
that
statute
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
state
prosecution.
the
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
anything,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
suggest
that
there
is
perhaps
less
need
for
this
kind
of
special
unique
protection
for
juveniles.
now
that
is
not
an
argument
that
we
have
made
in
our
brief
to
you
but
to
the
extent
that
that
it
is
relevant
at
all
that
this
court
has
in
recent
years
with
the
exception
of
jury
trial
extended
a
wide
variety
of
rights
to
juveniles
on
the
theory
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
same
treatment
constitutionally
as
adults.
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
that
it
can
cut
against
us
in
any
event.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
that
that
consideration
is
for
legislatures.
but
when
you
balance
against
a
first
amendment
interest
as
we
view
it
as
pristine
as
this,
the
right
of
the
juvenile
involved
here,
what
it
said
to
be
the
right
of
the
juvenile
involved
here
we
don't
think
that
that
comes
out
very
close
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
cite
here
for
example
your
own
decision
of
davis
versus
alaska
which
this
court
came
to
consider
the
rights
of
the
juvenile
to
confidentiality
of
his
juvenile
criminal
record
as
against
the
sixth
amendment
rights
of
confrontation
of
a
party
accused
f
a
crime,
in
that
case
alaska
have
put
a
juvenile
on
the
stand
so
far
as
the
case
reads
and
without
the
consent,
without
any
waiver
by
the
juvenile,
put
him
on
the
stand
that
this
court
held
that
testimony
must
be
permitted
as
to
his
prior
juvenile
record
and
even
though
temporary
imbalancement
that
might
result
to
the
juvenile
and
his
family,
the
court
said
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
the
defendant
in
that
case,
triumph
had
to
prevail
over
the
right
of
the
juvenile.
we
would
think
that
any
kind
of
equitable
treatment
of
first
amendment
rights
so
that
at
least
the
same
ruling
ought
to
apply
here
in
the
nebraska
case
and
the
ruling
of
the
court
was
that
the
court
would
not
choose
between
the
first
and
sixth
amendment
rights
but
not
put
one
above
the
other.
if
that
is
so,
we
think
at
the
very
least
and
that
the
first
amendment
is
entitled
to
as
much
regard
in
this
context
as
a
sixth
amendment
was
given
in
the
alaska
case.
there
are
two
additional
factors
which
i'd
like
to
mention.
what
is
it
the
statute
simply
cannot
work
assuming
that
first
amendment
law
were
less
clear
than
we
think
it
is,
one
would
(inaudible)
and
i'd
look
to
the
question
what
the
statute
is
going
to
do,
what
would
it
accomplish
assuming
the
court
were
even
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
ad
hoc
balancing
test
of
which
we
would
strongly
disapprove,
the
statute
simply
cannot
accomplish
the
end
of
leading
to
rehabilitation
for
juveniles
or
the
like.
how
could
it
when
it
is
so
under
inclusive
not
only
have
it
exclude
radio
and
television,
to
include
magazines
to
include
everything
in
the
world
including
private
conversations
except
newspaper
publication.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
possible
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
even
to
the
extent
that
that
is
considered
a
distinguishing
factor
of
newspapers
although
not
i
think
of
magazines
for
example
which
also
have
indexes
of
west
virginia
can't
control
without
a
state
newspapers
published
about
materials
such
as
this.
i
take
they
can
and
i
read
the
nebraska
case
to
indicate
that
they
cannot
therefore
they
couldn't
even
affect
all
the
newspapers
even
if
they
wanted
to
deal
with
newspapers
as
discreet
class.
and
as
i've
suggested
already,
this
case
is
illustrative,
the
facts
of
this
case
it
seems
to
are
illustrative
of
why
this
statute
can't
work.
we
do
not
rely
as
mr.
justice
marshall
indicated
earlier
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
statute
in
our
view
is
facially
unconstitutional
but
this
killing
occurred
in
a
community
of
14,000
people.
it
occurred
in
a
junior
high
school,
the
only
junior
high
school
in
town.
it
occurred
in
front
of
at
least
seven
eyewitnesses.
everybody
in
that
community
knows
about
this
and
everybody
knew
about
it,
to
think
that
a
statute
can
pass
constitutional
master
where
the
interest
that
is
promote
is
that
of
protecting
the
right
of
the
juvenile
for
what,
against
the
publicity
or
for
rehabilitation
later
on
when
everybody
in
his
community
knows
exactly
what
happened
to
him.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
constitutional
issue,
no.
and
that
is
why
i
indicated
that
as
in
nebraska
case,
this
is
simply
illustrative.
the
functioning
of
the
statute,
the
constitutional
argument
remains
precisely
the
same
whether
or
not
anybody
knows
about
it
in
any
particular
case.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
statute
which
punishes
speech
which
is
in
our
view
a
prior
restraint
as
well
on
speech
and
on
the
press
cannot
pass
master.
but
that
one
of
the
reasons
it
can't
is
the
reason
that
the
court
indicated
in
the
nebraska
press
association
case
in
which
the
court
said
that
a
whole
community
cannot
be
restrained
from
discussing
a
subject
intimately
affecting
life
within
it.
there
is
a
final
point.
there
are
other
means
in
west
virginia
has
sought
out
some
of
them
to
accomplish
this
end
legislation
against
discrimination
and
employment
against
people
with
juvenile
records
is
on
the
books
in
west
virginia
and
it
was
at
the
time
of
this
alleged
crime.
legislation
which
would
at
that
time,
1977
destroy
arrest
record
was
in
effect
in
west
virginia
at
that
time.
there
are
wide
variety
of
other
means
and
of
course
the
most
obvious
one
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
one
which
general
hanley
has
indicated
west
virginia
does
not
have
and
that
is
prosecution
against
public
officials
who
release
information
of
that
sort.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
destruction
of
arrest
of
records
which
has
its
own
panoply
of
constitutional
problems
which
i'm
not
reaching
here
but
the
--
is
one
way
taken
in
conjunction
with
other
ways
that
the
state
can
attempt
to
assure
that
a
juvenile
will
be
protected
from
the
effects
of
whatever
crime
that
he
is
accused
of.
it
is
not
a
totally
successful
way
anymore
than
anything
else
could
be
in
the
situation
where
anybody
can
know
what
happened
and
everybody
can
know
in
any
case
whether
juvenile
did
something
or
what
he
didn't
do.
it
is
relevant
i
think
as
it
was
in
landmark
that
the
approach
taken
by
west
virginia
here
is
one
of
a
very
small
minority
of
states.
as
our
brief
points
out,
the
west
virginia
is
one
of
only
six
states
at
which
purports
to
impose
criminal
punishments
on
the
press
or
for
its
publication
of
information
of
this
sort.
to
just
last
month,
after
our
briefs
were
submitted
to
this
court,
the
american
bar
association
adopted
the
recommendations
of
the
juvenile
justice
standards
project
of
the
institute
for
judicial
administration
and
of
the
aba
itself.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
sir.
and
the
conclusion
that
they
reached
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
right.
--
was
that
there
were
alternative
ways
to
do
this
and
what
they
recommended
was
essentially
greater
control
over
files
held
in
the
juvenile
court
system.
i
don't
suggest
for
a
moment
that
control
over
files
would
have
kept
this
information
from
coming
out
as
it
happens
the
facts
of
this
case
was
such
that
everybody
knew
what
happened
anyway.
but
the
position
of
the
aba
is
also
the
position
as
our
brief
indicates
of
a
wide
range
of
other
entities.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
we
make
no
argument
to
get
that
today
with
respect
to
any
right
of
press
access
to
closed
juvenile
hearings
that
raises
entirely
different
issues
and
that
is
neither
how
this
information
was
obtained
nor
is
it
an
argument
that
we're
making
in
this
case
at
all.
we
have
not
taken
the
position
in
this
case
and
that
the
press
is
entitled
to
access
to
closed
juvenile
proceedings.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
my
view
that
it
would
be
constitutional
for
a
statute
to
imposed
criminal
penalties
on
those
within
the
judicial
system
itself.
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
was
not
presented,
no.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
suppose,
i
would
think
that
while
it
would
obviously
carry
a
lot
of
the
same
effects,
it
would
not
be
the
“name”
i
think
it
would
not,
i
would
think
the
statute
would
not
apply.
i
would
think
you
have
to
read
the
criminal
statute
not
early
so
as
to
avoid
other
constitutional
problems
and
i
would
think
that
if
the
picture
were
published
that
--
without
a
name
that
that
would
not
constitute
violation
of
the
statute.
i
would
point
out
in
conclusion
that
what
this
case
pits
against
each
other
is
on
the
one
hand
the
first
amendment
interest
which
we
think
are
long
recognized
by
this
court
as
being
at
the
apex
of
first
amendment
protection.
the
ban
on
prior
restraints
as
we
view
it,
the
freedom
of
the
press
to
print
news
within
its
possession,
the
protection
of
truthful
speech
about
public
events
against
another
societal
interest,
non-constitutional
in
nature,
there's
no
suggestion
here
in
this
case
nor
as
i
understand
it
in
any
ruling
of
this
court
but
the
right
to
confidentiality
imposed
by
statute
of
this
sort
is
of
constitutional
magnitude,
speculative,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
or
so
far
as
we
know
in
the
literature
to
suggest
that
a
statute
of
this
sort
is
even
needed
to
lead
to
the
societal
result
of
which
the
sort
here
incapable
of
fulfillment
by
the
statute
because
of
its
under
inclusiveness
and
because
in
any
event
the
information
as
in
this
case
is
often
widely
known.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
would
be
potentially
obtainable,
yes.
i
have
nothing
else
your
honors.
thank
you
very
much.
