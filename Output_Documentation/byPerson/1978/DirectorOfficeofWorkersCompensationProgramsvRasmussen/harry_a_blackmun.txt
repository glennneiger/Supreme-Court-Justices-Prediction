i
take
it
then
that
your
entire
case
rests
on

(d)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
you
must
concede
that
congress
as
is
so
often
the
case,
could
have
drafted
it
a
little
more
intelligently?
justice

mr.
ostmann,
if
there
is
redundancy
between
the
two
sections,
do
you
think
that
your
case
is
demolished,
can
you
live
with
redundancy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
a
question
whether
we
can?
