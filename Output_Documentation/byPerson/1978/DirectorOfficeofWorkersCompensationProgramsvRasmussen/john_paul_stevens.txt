paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
while
you
are
interrupted,
where
is
section
10
in
the
briefs
you
rely
on
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
cited
as
10
(f)
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
quote
10
(h)
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
isn't
it
correct
that
if
you
are
drafting
the
statute
and
you
wanted
to
just
substitute
a
different
fixed,
different
maximum
on
death
benefits,
you
would
have
put
it
in
the
new
9
(e)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
they
would
have
just
put
it
back
in
the
same
place,
it
came
out
of
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
when
i
read
9
(e)
as
i
was
reading
just
left
something
else
here
if
that's
what
you
are
meant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ostmann,
on
that
point,
if
the
person
dies
while
he
is
receiving
permanent
disability
benefits
under
the
statute,
the
section
you
just
read,
will
that
disability
benefit
be
converted
into
a
death
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
if
he
was
in
a
high
enough
weekly
wage,
here
the
benefit
would
rise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
ostmann,
if
the
exclusion
of
temporary
disability
beneficiaries
from
the
language
of
6
(d)
is
intended
to
exclude
them,
why
wouldn't
the
same
rationale
apply
to
the
section
10
as
well
because
if
that
refers
only
to
permanent
and
death
and
fails
to
mention
temporary
why
wouldn't,
why
do
you
need
the
(d)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
wouldn't
10
(f)
of
its
own
force
exclude
temporary
disability
recipients
for
any
increases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
one
strange
thing
about
the
6
(d),
it
refers
to
determinations
under
this
subsection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
subsection
you
understand
that
it
referred
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
a
section
rather
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ostmann
after
hearing
this
before
the
revised
2381
or
2318
whichever
it
was
proposed,
how
much
testimony
was
there
in
support
of
the
view
that
there
should
be
no
maximums
at
all,
is
there
significant
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
what
you
are
cutting
through
all
the
language,
your
basic
position
is
that
even
though
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
legislative
reports
directly
that
there
must
been
a
compromise
between
the
two
facts
and
they
said
okay
we
will
but
the
ceiling
in
--
keep
a
ceiling
on
disability
and
take
it
often
and.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sennett,
can
i
interrupt
you
there?
supposing
it
would
have
been
logically,
some
senators,
senator
eagleton
and
others
thought
it
would
have
been
logical
and
take
the
ceilings
off
entirely,
if
there
is
a
case
got
that
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
is
it
totally
irrational
for
a
couple
of
senators
on
opposite
sides
of
the
argument
to
say,
well
we
split
the
difference
and
will
take
it
off
one,
but
not
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
may
be
in
a
negotiation
between
the
two
they
thought
there
are
less
dollars
writing
on
death
benefits
than
there
are
disability
benefits
and
let's
make
this
our
trade-off.
