mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
proper
construction
of
the
benefit
provisions
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
the
facts
have
been
stipulated.
in
1973,
william
c.
rasmussen
was
employed
by
petitioner
geo
control
incorporated
under
a
public
works
contract
with
united
states.
dr.
rasmussen
was
killed
during
the
course
of
his
employment
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
respondents,
dr.
rasmussen's
surviving
widow
and
son,
are
entitled
to
receive
weekly
death
benefits
under
the
act.
a
dispute
arose,
however,
concerning
the
amount
of
benefits
to
be
paid.
respondents
claim
that
under
section
9
(b)
of
the
act,
they
are
entitled
to
receive
two-thirds
of
dr.
rasmussen's
weekly
wages
without
limitation
or
a
total
benefit
of
approximately
$530
per
week.
the
employer
and
the
insurer,
however,
have
taken
the
position
that
this
proposed
award
exceeds
a
ceiling
on
benefits
under
the
act.
they
contended
and
the
director
of
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs
agreed
that
the
ceiling
on
disability
benefit
set
forth
in
section
6
(b)
(1)
of
the
act
is
made
applicable
to
death
benefits
as
well
by
section
6
(d).
the
dispute
came
before
the
benefits
review
board,
which
rejected
the
director's
position.
the
board
concluded
that
when
congress
amended
section
9
in
1972
to
delete
a
fixed
dollar
maximum
on
death
benefits,
congress
expressed
its
intention
to
free
death
benefits
from
any
ceiling
restriction.
the
decision
of
the
board
was
upheld
on
review
by
the
ninth
circuit.
it's
our
position
that
when
congress
deleted
the
fixed
dollar
maximum
on
death
benefits
in
1972
from
section
9
of
the
act,
they
did
so
as
part
of
an
extensive
revision
of
the
act
and
that
a
significant
effect
of
that
revision
was
to
reformulate
and
transfer
from
section
9
to
section
6
of
the
act,
the
ceiling
on
death
benefits.
as
i
will
discuss,
the
legislative
history
shows
the
congress
intended
to
retain
its
ceiling
on
both
death
and
disability
benefits
and
that
the
effect
of
section
6
(d)
is
to
make
the
ceiling
applicable
to
both.
in
order
to
place
the
amendments
within
their
proper
context,
i
will
first
briefly
review
their
legislative
history
and
then
discuss
the
way
in
which
the
provisions
accomplish
what
congress
intended.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
believe
that
section
6
(d)
provides
for
the
ceiling,
the
application
of
the
6
(b)
(1)
ceiling
to
death
benefits.
we
rest
exclusively
on
6
(d)
except
we
regard
6
(d)
is
explained
by
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
of
course.
one
of
the
deficiencies
the
1972
amendments
were
designed
to
correct
was
the
inadequacy
of
the
fixed
dollar
maximums
that
were
then
applicable
to
death
and
disability
benefits.
from
1961
the
maximum
limited
compensation
to
$70
per
week.
the
national
commission
on
state
workers
compensation
laws,
which
was
chartered
by
congress
to
recommend
reforms
in
workers
compensation
programs,
reported
to
congress
in
1972
that
a
substantial
percentage
of
covered
workers
received
wages
that
placed
them
above
the
fixed
maximum
limitations.
the
commission
concluded
that
ceilings
are
justified
as
a
means
of
containing
the
costs
of
the
program
and
because
high-income
employees
can
and
do
obtain
supplementary
insurance
from
private
sources.
they
concluded,
however,
that
in
order
to
keep
the
ceilings
current
with
inflation,
the
ceiling
should
be
stated
as
a
percentage
of
national
average
wages
rather
than
as
a
fixed
dollar
maximum.
and
therefore
they
recommended
specifically
that
the
ceiling
for
disability
and
death
both
be
initially
established
at
a
125%
of
national
average
wages
with
phased-in
increases
over
a
three
year
period
to
an
ultimate
ceiling
of
200%
of
average
wages.
the
legislation
adopted
by
congress
in
1972
reflects
the
substantial
imprint
of
this
recommendation.
indeed
the
senate
report
suggests
that
the
legislation
is
fully
consistent
with
the
commission's
recommendation.
in
particular,
congress
removed
the
fixed
dollar
maximum
on
both
death
and
disability
benefits
and
amended
section
6
(b)
(1)
of
the
act
to
incorporate
for
disability
benefits,
a
phased-in
ceiling
based
on
increase
in
percentages
of
national
average
wages
just
as
the
commission
had
proposed.
the
congress
then
simply
added
an
additional
provision,
stating
expressly
that
if
the
phased-in
ceiling
was
applicable
to
death
benefits
as
well,
this
case
would
have
not
arisen.
congress
did
not
do
that
however.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
in
drafting
section
6
(d)
though
congress
intended
to
achieve
this
result
and
an
additional
objective
at
the
same
time.
the
senate
and
house
reports
note
in
drafting
section
6
(d),
congress
was
concerned
that
during
the
interval
before
the
commission's
proposed
phased-in
ceiling
reached
its
ultimate
maximum
of
200%,
workers
receiving
an
initial
award
of
benefits
would
find
their
benefits
unfairly
limited
in
future
years
to
the
lower
parentage
ceiling
than
prevailing
at
the
time
of
their
initial
award.
the
reports
state
that
the
drafters
of
section
6
intended
“to
the
extent
that
employees
receiving
compensation
for
total
permanent
disability
or
survivors
receiving
death
benefits,
receive
less
than
the
compensation
they
would
receive
if
they
were
no
phase-in.
their
compensation
is
to
be
increased
as
the
ceiling
moves
to
200%.”
the
language
of
section
6
(d)
gains
its
meaning
from
this
expression
of
congressional
understanding.
section
6
(d)
provides,
in
not
these
words
but
to
this
effect,
that
determinations
made
pursuant
to
section
6
which
include
the
determination
of
the
phased-in
ceiling
for
each
period
in
section
6
(b)
(1),
“shall
apply
to
employees
or
survivors
currently
receiving
permanent
total
disability
or
death
benefits
as
well
as
to
those
newly
awarded
compensation
during
that
period.”
it
seems
from
the
legislative
history,
the
congress
understood
section
6
(d)
to
accomplish
two
results.
it
provides
that
the
periodic
determination
of
ceiling
benefits
pursuant
to
section
6
(b)
(1)
shall
apply
to
survivors
receiving
death
benefits.
it
further
provides
that
as
the
phased-in
ceiling
is
increased
towards
the
ultimate
maximum
of
200%
of
average
wages,
the
newly
determined
ceiling
is
to
be
applicable
to
survivors
and
to
the
permanently,
totally
disabled
whether
or
not
they
receive
their
initial
award
in
that
year.
thus
if
a
person
were
to
receive
a
survivor
or
disability
award
in
the
year
where
the
ceiling
was
125%
of
national
average
wages,
three
years
later
when
the
ceiling
moved
up
to
200%
of
national
average
wages,
their
compensation
would
be
adjusted
up
to
that
new
ceiling.
certainly,
the
language
in
section
6
(d)
can
be
understood
the
way
congress
understood
it.
the
section
cannot
adequately
be
understood
any
other
way.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
section
6
(d)
as
only
referring
to
the
annual
computation
of
national
average
wages
which
is
performed
by
the
secretary
under
6
(b)
(3)
of
the
act
and
the
court
concluded
that
this
computation
was
relevant
only
to
the
determination
of
minimum
benefits.
the
court
said
that
section
6
(d)
merely
assures
that
minimum
benefits
are
adjusted
annually
to
reflect
inflation.
this
construction
of
section
6
(d)
deprives
the
provision
of
any
meaning.
in
amending,
the
act
in
1972,
congress
adopted
the
additional
recommendation
of
the
national
commission
and
provided
in
section
10
that
the
recipients
of
permanent
total
disability
compensation
and
survivors'
benefits
the
precise
people
referred
to
in
section
6
(d)
are
to
receive
an
annual
increase
in
their
benefits
equal
to
the
percentage
increase
in
national
average
wages.
as
we
have
discussed
in
detail
in
our
brief
and
as
the
third
circuit
fully
described
in
their
opinion
in
the
o'keefe
case,
the
section
10
inflation
adjustment
accomplishes
precisely
the
result
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
assigned
to
section
6
(d).
if
section
6
(d)
means
only
what
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
the
section
is
surplusage
to
the
statute.
it's
of
course
the
court's
responsibility
to
give
meaning
to
every
word
and
clause
of
the
statute
where
possible
and
this
is
especially
true
we
submit
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
the
legislative
history
reflects
that
the
section
was
intended
to
have
an
active
role.
that
role
is
articulated
in
the
senate
and
the
house
reports,
which
state
their
understanding
that
the
adjustment
under
section
6
(d)
will
make
the
phased-in,
the
redetermination
of
the
phased-in
ceiling
on
disability
benefits
applicable
to
both
classes
of
beneficiaries.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
indeed,
we
should
had.
i
think
that
the
basic
problem
is
that
section
6
(d)
--
congress
tried
to
do
too
much.
i
think
the
legislative
history
reflects
though
what
congress'
understanding
of
what
it
was
doing
and
even
if
the
language
is
ambiguous,
the
expression
of
congressional
understanding
should
be
controlling.
the
respondents
claim
that
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
it
is
shown
on
page
16
of
our
brief
in
the
text.
its
effect
is
discussed
in
our
brief
on
pages
30
and
31
and
in
the
o'keefe
case
i
believe
it's
discussed
toward
the
end
of
the
opinion.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
10
(f)
and
10
(h)
are
both
relevant
as
we
discuss
briefly
in
our
brief.
10
(f)
applies
the
annual
inflation
adjustment
to
the
recipients
of
benefits,
who
have
received
their
initial
award
following
the
date
of
the
amendments.
10
(h)
requires
that
the
same
adjustment
be
made
for
persons
who
receive
their
awards
in
prior
years.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
it
is
quoted.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
pardon
me.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
10
(h)
as
you
can
see
is
a
compendious
provision,
but
the
provision
that
it
is
relevant
in
this
regard
is
10
(h)
(3)
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
right
hand
column
on
page
31,
which
makes
subsection
10
(f)
applicable
to
awards
of
benefits
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
amendments.
respondents
say
that
the
language
in
section
6
(d)
is
ambiguous
in
that
the
remedial
nature
of
the
act
--
because
of
the
remedial
nature
of
the
act,
that
they
the
statute
should
be
constituted
in
their
favor.
we,
of
course,
agree
that
the
act
is
remedial,
but
the
question
here
is
what
the
purpose
of
congress
was
in
enacting
this
legislation.
the
general
--
there
are
certainly
no
general
remedial
policy
that's
ever
been
expressed
that
favors
unrestricted
ceilings
on
workers
compensation
benefits.
the
consistent
course
that
state
and
federal
legislation
in
this
area
has
been
to
provide
equivalent
ceiling
limitations
on
both
state,
i
mean
on
both
disable
permanent
disability
and
death
benefits.
the
few
states
that
have
departed
from
their
consistent
course
have
provided
higher
ceilings
for
disability
than
for
death
benefits
and
i
think
that
reflects
the
underlying
objectives
or
rational
for
the
ceiling
restrictions.
the
ceilings
consistently
be
then
understood
as
justified
by
the
need
to
contain
the
cost
of
the
program
and
because
high-income
employees
can
and
do
obtain
insurance
to
protect
their
supplemental
needs.
death
is
the
risk
that's
most
often
insured
against.
the
brief
submitted
by
the
petitioner
geo
control
notes
approximately
95%
of
upper
income
employees
obtained
death
insurance.
so,
if
congress
were
concerned
with
a
choice
as
to
which,
where
the
remedial
need
were
greater,
they
would
presumably
have
concluded
that
disability
was
the
greater
need.
in
it
--
more
over
the
need
of
the
family
is
greater
when
the
benefit
must
support
not
only
the
family,
but
the
disabled
worker
as
well.
and
in
light
of
all
of
these
concerns,
i
think
chief
judge
wright
was
correct
in
the
boughman
case
in
stating
that
it
would
have
been
anomalous
for
congress
to
have
left
departed
from
that
consistent
remedial
understanding
of
the
consistent
treatment
of
death
and
disability
benefits
without
ever
so
stating.
i
would
like
to
note
that
the
legislative
history
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relies
for
its
contrary
conclusion,
simply
doesn't
focus
on
the
question
that
is
presented
here.
the
portions
of
the
committee
reports
that
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
state
only
the
literal
affect
of
the
amendment
to
section
9
by
stating
that
the
fixed
dollar
maximum
on
death
benefits
was
removed
from
that
section.
it
was
of
course
necessary
to
remove
the
fixed
dollar
maximum
on
death
benefits
from
section
9
to
allow
the
higher,
substantially
higher
ceiling
benefits
established
in
section
6
to
have
affect.
more
over
the
statement
of
the
literal
affect
of
the
removal
of
the
fixed
dollar
maximum
from
section
9
follows
the
committee's
explanation
that
the
phased-in
ceiling
in
section
6
will
be
applicable
to
both
the
permanently
totally
disabled
and
to
survivors.
if
there
are
no
questions
-
-
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
if
i
had
done
it,
the
simplest
way
would
have
been
added
to
6
(b)
(1)
rather
than
having
an
entire
additional
clause
paralleling
6
(b)
(1)
could
have
added
the
words
to
6
(b)
(1).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
suggested
what
congress
thought
it
was
doing
and
what
it
intend
to
do
in
section
6
(d)
was
to
bring
into
section
6
the
limitation
on
death
benefits
because
of
the
economy
of
its
--
if
you
look
at
section
6
(b)
(1)
it's
a
fairly
good
size
provision
and
to
repeat
the
provision
entirely
in
section
9
would
have
served
no
purpose
that
isn't
served
just
by
referring
to
the
section
6
(b)
(1)
limit
and
making
it
applicable
in
section
6
itself
to
death
benefits.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
--
thanks.
