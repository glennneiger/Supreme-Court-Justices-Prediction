justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
commission
distinguish
between
maximums
and
minimums
for
disability
and
maximum
and
minimums
for
death
benefits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
later
make
any
distinguish
between?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
true
that
a
death
benefit
could
be
lost
by
a
widow's
remarriage
in
a
fairly
short
period
of
time
whereas
a
disability
benefit
could
continue
for
a
rather
indefinite
period
of
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
would
conclude
that
the
statutory
language
is
absolutely
clear
that
disabilities
do
have
maximums
and
death
benefits
do
not,
but
we
were
also
to
conclude
that
we
can't
think
of
any
conceivable
reason
why
congress
would
do
that,
should
we
affirm
or
reverse?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
part
of
the
1972
amendments
were
--
there
were
some
trade-offs
on
both
sides?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
why
do
you
talk
about
this
being
beneficently
construed
and
liberally
construed
toward
a
worker?
it
was
a
give
and
take
thing
with
the
unions
on
one
side
management
on
the
other.
there
is
no
reason
why
this
court
should
favor
one
over
the
other,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
that
may
be
true
historically,
but
as
i
understand
your
response
to
my
question
there
was
just
some
pretty
hard
nosed
bargaining
in
1972
and
management
was
on
one
side
and
labor
was
on
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
should
we
construe
the
removal
of
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine,
unseaworthiness
doctrine
beneficently,
remedially?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
elimination
of
the
unseaworthiness
remedy,
how
should
that
be
construed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
all
respect,
mr.
william
rasmussen
was
fatally
injured
during
the
course
of
his
employment
in
south
vietnam
when
the
vehicle
in
which
he
was
driving
was
blown
up
by
a
land
mine.
his
employment
was
covered
by
the
provisions
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act
and
his
surviving
widow
and
son,
the
respondents
here,
claimed
death
benefits
of
$532
a
week
under
section
909
of
the
act.
rasmussen's
employer,
its
insurance
carrier,
and
the
director
of
the
department
of
labors
office
of
workers’
compensation
programs,
petitioners
here
contended
the
death
benefits
payable
to
the
respondent
were
limited
to
$167
a
week
under
another
section
of
the
act.
the
administrative
law
judge
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed
with
the
petitioner's
contention
holding
that
the
death
benefits
payable
under
the
act
are
not
subject
to
the
maximum
limitations
placed
on
disability
payments
by
this
other
section
of
the
act.
today
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
of
the
complex
nature
of
the
question,
our
decision
does
not
lend
itself
to
detailed
explanation
from
the
bench,
suffice
it
to
say,
they
were
convinced
by
the
plain
language
of
the
provisions
in
the
act
and
by
the
legislative
history
that
congresses
omission
of
a
maximum
limitation
on
death
benefits
payable
under
the
act
was
intentional.
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
consolidated
cases.
