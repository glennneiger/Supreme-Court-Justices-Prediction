mr.
albert
h.
sennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
albert
sennett
and
i
represent
geo
control
and
the
insurance
company
new
hampshire
insurance.
the
task
of
statutory
construction
is
one
of
discerning
the
intend
of
a
legislature.
we
submit
that
the
intend
of
congress
in
this
particular
matter
to
provide
the
same
maximum
limits
for
disability
and
death
benefits
can
be
discerned
from
the
following
considerations.
both
bills,
senate
bill
525
introduced
in
the
92nd
congress
and
house
bill
3505
introduced
in
the
same
congress
provided
for
identical
maximums.
report
of
the
national
commission
of
state
workers
compensation
laws
recommended
the
same
maximum
weekly
benefits
for
disability
and
death
benefits
and
the
report
accompanying
senate
bill
238
states
that
the
committee
believes
that
the
provisions
of
the
bill
presented
are
fully
consistent
with
the
recommendations
with
national
commission
in
its
report
issued
july
21,
1972.
as
my
brother
has
stated
that
the
reference
from
6
(d)
of
the
act
to
death
benefits
and
disability
benefits
is
also
a
fact
to
be
considered
by
this
court.
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
10
(f)
of
the
act
makes
the
provisions
for
all
the
adjustments
necessary,
makes
all
these
separate
independent
and
meaning
to
6
(d)
as
presented
to
this
court
a
few
minutes
ago.
the
fact
that
the
identical
maximums
are
fully
consistent
with
all
state
workers'
compensation
laws
is
another
fact
to
consider.
the
concept
of
payments
to
injured
workers,
who
have
been
deprived
of
their
wages
by
reason
of
industrial
injury,
is
a
concept
to
provide
replacement
of
wage
laws.
the
consideration
for
replacing
the
wage
laws
in
return
calls
for
some
limitation
in
the
upper
limits
of
liability
in
the
employer.
this
has
been
consistently
the
type
of
trade-off
and
the
type
of
political
bargaining
process
that
is
in
the
history
of
this
act
and
the
history
of
other
state
worker's
compensation
acts.
it
is
generally
have
been
felt
and
we
believe
it
is
demonstrated
again
in
this
particular
series
of
sections
that
the
upper
limits
of
the
places
where
the
cut-off
becomes
effective,
the
theory
being
that
the
higher
paid
employees
are
capable
of
providing
against
the
impact
of
death,
capable
of
providing
impact
against
disastrous
loses
to
their
family.
that
the
concern
congress
showed
in
this
particular
instance
was
with
the
lower
paid
employees
and
the
impact
of
this
particular
act
guarantees
certain
basic
returns
to
lower
employees,
which
were
not
present
in
the
old
act
and
that
seems
to
be
the
major
thrust
of
many
of
the
changes
that
they
propagated
in
the
1972.
the
fact
is
that
if
congress
wished
to
depart
from
this
traditional
and
historic
consistent
pattern,
it
would
appear
that
some
very
clear
express
statement
had
been
made
with
respect
to
the
law.
basically
the
respondent's
position
here
is
an
attempt
to
interpret
a
the
fact
that
one
--
one
section
of
the
act
there
is
no
omission
--
reference
to
these
benefits.
the
other
point
that
i
wish
to
take
in
a
few
minutes
that
i
have
left
in
time
that
i
have
reserved
for
this
court,
is
that
the
argument
advanced
in
the
respondents'
brief
at
page
28
suggest
that
the
no
ceiling
limit
is
justified
in
industrial
deaths
because
this
represents
only
approximately
1%
of
all
industrial
injuries
and
perhaps
some
special
exception
would
be
required.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
death
benefits
are
defined
in
the
section
9
of
the
act
is
applying
both
to
deaths
which
occurred
directly
as
a
result
of
industrial
injury
as
well
as
deaths
which
are
occurred
by
reason
of
unrelated
causes,
if
at
the
time
of
the
person's
demise,
he
is
suffering
a
permanent
and
total
disability.
this
is
a
much
larger
class
of
people
and
would
give
even
an
increased
anomalous
situation
the
ones
that
have
been
demonstrated
in
the
briefs.
in
sum
then
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
in
light
of
the
consistent
pattern
of
providing
for
maximum
limits
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
compensation
system
meant
to
replace
wage
loss,
there
is
then
will
be
no
consistency
and
no
logic
and
assuming
that
congress
intended
to
depart
from
the
traditional
way
of
solving
compensation
loss
cases
and
substituting
them
entirely
in
anomalous
situation.
i
intend
to
reserve
about
two
minutes
of
rebuttal
if
the
court
has
any
questions?
mr.
albert
h.
sennett
i
have
a
brief
rebuttal.
i
find
myself
largely
in
agreement
with
the
former
speaker
that
the
act
has
been
there
for
some
purpose.
the
intent
of
congress
had
clearly
indicated
in
the
act
and
that
is
to
increase
benefits
substantially.
however,
i
have
heard
no
presentation
to
this
court
and
i
have
seen
none
in
the
briefs
presented
and
i
have
seen
none
in
the
history
we
have
studied,
which
can
offer
some
rational
analysis
or
a
logical
distinction
as
to
why
there
should
be
a
differential
between
disability
benefits
and
death
benefits.
mr.
albert
h.
sennett
there
certainly
is,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
h.
sennett
because
in
the
light
of
a
compensation
system
which
is
meant
to
replace
the
loss
of
wages
to
a
family,
the
logic
would
be
to
as
indicated
previously
in
the
opening
remarks
to
increase
disability
benefits
because
the
impact
of
a
loss
of
wages
of
a
man
who
is
--
mr.
albert
h.
sennett
it's
perhaps,
well
it
might
be
well
to
speculate
about
that
but
along
those
lines
keep
in
mind
the
longshore
act
by
extension
applies
to
employees
of
district
of
columbia
to
commonwealth
employees
to
a
vast
variety
of
employees,
many
of
them
enjoyed
very
substantial
salaries
greatly
in
excess
of
what
has
been
contemplated
for
longshoremen.
i
think
the
best
way
i
can
rebut
this
is
to
illustrate
what
would
happen
if
the
position
of
mr.
ostmann
were
correct.
in
other
words,
if
mr.
rasmussen
had
suffered
a
total
and
permanent
disability
instantly
upon
his
injury
and
it
was
irreversible
and
left
him
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
vagaries
of
time
and
his
family,
he
would
be
enjoying
a
$167
a
week
plus
the
additional
increments
that
we
have
been
discussing
so
that
at
the
present
time
if
he
was
still
alive
and
still
he
would
be
be
receiving
$398
a
week.
according
to
the
proposition
advanced
by
mr.
ostmann
immediately
upon
his
demise
his
family
would
enjoy
$532
a
week.
we
submit
to
this
court
there
is
no
logic
to
that
--
mr.
albert
h.
sennett
that
167
would
last
and
that
is
the
reason
for
the
increases
on
a
yearly
basis
provided
by
the
congress,
it's
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind
mr.
justice
and
that
is
because
of
that
concern
of
that
kind
of
money
would
not
reflect
the
needs
of
a
family.
there
was
increases
up
to
200%
so
that
the
present
time
that
family
would
had
would
enjoy
$398
a
week.
mr.
albert
h.
sennett
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
perhaps
in
illustration
--
mr.
albert
h.
sennett
it
sounds
like
somewhat
of
a
cynical
remark,
kept
in
light
of
the
fact
this
is
a
compensation
system
and
not
a
damage
system.
i
think
that
is
the
proper
characterization
of
the
implications
of
what
is
being
advanced
--
mr.
albert
h.
sennett
we
believe
that
congress
has
given
a
signal
to
the
court
and
the
signal
perhaps
is
a
bit
murky,
but
the
signal
was
there
and
that
one
examines
the
intent
of
a
system
i
think
the
answer
is
relatively
straight
forward
and
self-evident.
if
there
no
other
questions,
i'll
be
happy
to
retire.
