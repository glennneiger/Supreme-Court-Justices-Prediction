mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
we
believe
that
there
are
really
two
questions
in
this
case;
one
to
the
congress
eliminate
the
death
benefit
maximum
payments
from
the
statute
in
the
1972
amendments
and
if
they
did
so
was
the
elimination
a
conscious
and
deliberate
act.
respondent's
answer
to
both
questions
yes.
yes
the
congress
did
eliminate
the
death
benefit
maximum
payments
from
the
act
and
yes
the
elimination
was
a
conscious
and
deliberate
act
by
the
congress.
when
the
statute
is
read
as
amended,
one
thing
is
apparent.
in
no
section
is
there
a
clear
death
benefit
maximum.
in
section
9,
where
the
death
benefit
maximums
have
been
set
out
traditionally
and
exclusively
specifically
at
9
(e)
it
has
been
eliminated,
excised
from
the
statute.
at
section
6
(b)
there
are
a
maximum
set
out
a
phase-in
maximums,
but
they
are
applied
only
to
disability
by
the
clear
language
of
section
6
(b).
section
6
(d)
does
mention
both
death
benefits
and
permanent
total
disability,
but
does
not
contain
any
maximum.
it
does
have
a
purpose
we
submit,
which
we
will
discuss
in
a
few
moments.
because
there
has
been
some
obscurity
in
section
6
(d)
and
because
eliminating
death
benefits
maximums
is
a
departure
from
this
act's
history
and
in
fact
from
general
workmen's
compensation
prior
tribunals
have
looked
at
the
legislative
history
to
determine
what
the
intention
of
congress
was.
in
the
legislative
history,
it's
important
to
note
that
from
the
very
beginning
when
s.2318
was
first
introduced
by
senator
eagleton,
maximums
for
disability
and
death
were
excised
from
the
recommendations.
no
mention
whatsoever
made
of
any
maximums
for
disability
or
death.
further
from
the
beginning
of
the
hearings
in
this
matter,
senator
eagleton
stated
in
his
opening
remarks
that
s.2318
“would
eliminate
the
maximum
payment
limitations.”
and
further
from
the
beginning
there
was
no
doubt
among
all
the
witnesses
testified
before
that
committee
as
to
the
effect
and
the
intend
of
s.2318.
needless
to
say
there
was
much
testimony
on
this
proposal.
it
was
discussed
by
judge
devany
in
his
decision
in
order
and
also
in
our
brief.
the
industry
side
of
course,
opposing
it,
labor
side
generally
thinking
it
was
advisable.
following
that
testimony,
a
revised
2318
was
submitted.
it
was
substantially
rewritten.
section
6,
6
(b)
(1)
created
a
new
maximum
for
disability
based
on
an
increasing
national
average
weekly
wage
and
it
had
a
phase-in
of
this
new
maximum.
section
9
was
also
rewritten.
it
is
not
overlooked,
it's
not
forgotten.
specifically
at
section
9
(e)
for
instance,
a
new
minimum
was
inserted
by
the
revised
2318
which
was
tied
to
the
national
average
weekly
wage,
a
term
added
to
the
revised
s.2318.
we
think
when
the
original
s.2318's
version
of
section
9
(e)
is
seen
and
read
and
is
compared
to
the
revised
s.2318
version
of
9
(e)
which
was
enacted
into
law,
the
reader
finds
a
striking
similarity.
in
fact,
the
sections
are
almost
identical,
except
for
changing
the
basis
for
the
minimum
benefits
in
deaths
from
a
dollar
figure
to
the
national
average
weekly
wage.
respondents
submit
that
it
is
beyond
reason
to
say
that
congress
some
how
suffered
some
sort
of
collective
amnesia
and
forgot
what
the
original
s.2318
meant,
forgot
what
senator
eagleton
said
it
would
accomplish
and
forgot
the
tremendous
amount
of
testimony
from
the
witnesses
that
described
a
very
intent
and
action
of
s.2318.
rather
it
is
far
more
sensible
and
logical
to
say
that
the
congress
realized
what
it
was
doing
and
that
it
consciously
and
deliberately
did
not
add
a
maximum
in
section
9
(e).
stepping
back
for
a
moment
in
the
sequence
of
legislative
history,
just
before
revised
s.2318
was
written
an
important
event
took
place
and
that
was
the
report
of
the
national
commission
on
state
workmen's
compensation
laws.
it
was
submitted
to
the
president
and
to
the
congress.
this
report
was
a
comprehensive
study
of
state
workmen's
compensation
systems
and
it
made
certain
recommendations
for
what
it
thought
provision
should
be
in
this
field.
as
with
any
other
commission,
there
are
many
members,
many
different
view
points
and
this
is
seen
when
one
looks
behind
the
recommendations
to
the
discussions
that
led
up
to
the
recommendations.
for
instance,
when
maximums
and
minimums
were
discussed
by
the
commission
it
was
found
to
be
only
uneasy
case
for
those
and
of
two
the
commission
found
maximums
to
be
the
more
troublesome.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
when
they
discussed
maximums
and
minimums
at
the
beginning
of
the
report,
there
was
no
distinction
made.
that
portion
of
discussing
the
advisability
of
maximums
and
minimums,
the
report
i
believe
had
application
to
both
death
and
disability.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
yes
they,
we
believe
they
did.
we
believe
that
there
were
some
comments
made
that
i
am
going
to
get
you
in
a
moment,
where
the
report
discusses
death
in
a
matter
different
from
disability.
for
instance,
in
the
opening
paragraph
on
death
benefits,
the
commission
makes
an
interesting
comment.
it
says
that
death
is
the
ultimate
work
related
tragedy
and
deserves
full
compensation.
now
later,
of
course,
they
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
same
maximum
in
their
estimation
should
apply,
but
that
statement
was
their
opening
statement
with
respect
to
death
benefits.
no
similar
statement
was
made
with
respect
to
disability.
later
in
discussing
the
proportion
of
the
wage
that
should
be
replaced
in
death
cases,
the
commission
discussed
the
advisability
that
perhaps
a
higher
percentage
of
the
average
wage
of
the
deceased
should
be
replaced
in
death
cases,
basing
it
on
the
incentive
argument.
the
incentive
argument
being
that,
when
a
worker
is
disabled,
it
is
good
for
him,
it
is
good
for
society,
it
is
good
for
the
industry
if
this
individual
is
encouraged
to
get
back
to
work
and
be
productive
again.
because
of
that,
that
is
one
reason
why
benefits
are
limited
in
workmen's
compensation
to
a
percentage
of
that
wage.
now,
the
commission
did
end
up
as
i
said
recommending
the
same
percentage,
but
we
believe
that
this
discussion
is
important
because
this
discussion
was
part
of
the
legislative
history.
it
was
something
that
the
congress
read
and
must
have
considered
when
it
revised
2318.
and
it
also
establishes
some
discussion,
some
reason
for
having
benefits
higher
in
the
death
benefit
case
than
in
the
disability
case.
the
rationale
was
there.
further
as
judge
devany
pointed
out,
the
recommendations
of
the
national
commission
with
respect
to
death
and
disability
were
minimum
recommendations
only.
prior
to
each
percentage
that
they
recommended
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
commission
said
the
benefit
should
be
at
least
this
much.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
that's
correct.
if
a
widow
remarries,
she
receives
a
lump
sum
payment
and
after
that
she
gets
no
further
death
benefits
and
the
disability
of
course
could
continue
as
long
as
a
disability
exists,
permanent
total
disability.
there
is
a
final
important
point
about
the
national
commission's
report.
it
has
been
argued
here
that
with
respect
to
death
benefits,
the
congress
intended
to
follow
rather
precisely,
the
recommendations
of
the
national
commission
and
they
cited
something
from
the
legislative
history
saying
that,
the
new
act,
the
1972
amendments
were
fully
consistent
with
the
national
commission's
recommendations.
implicitly
then
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
go
beyond
the
national
commission
recommendations.
however,
there
is
another
section
in
the
act
as
amended
that
disproves
this
argument.
it
was
mentioned
by
mr.
sennett.
in
section
9,
the
first
sentence
says,
if
the
injury
causes
death
or
if
the
employee
who
sustains
permanent,
total
disability
due
to
the
injury
thereafter
dies
from
causes
other
than
the
injury,
the
compensations
would
be
known
as
a
death
benefit.
it's
our
submission
that's
a
radical
and
even
revolutionary
concept
in
workmen's
compensation.
to
say
that,
the
survivors
of
a
permanently
totally
disabled
worker
will
get
death
benefits
though
that
worker
dies
of
a
cause
totally
unrelated
to
his
injury
is
a
drastic
departure
and
yet
it
is
in
this
act.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
well,
i
think
what's
important
about
that
is
that
concept
was
not
recommended
by
the
national
commission,
was
not
even
discussed
by
the
national
commission.
the
national
commission
defined
death
benefits
as
paying
this
to
survivors
of
a
worker
who
dies
“as
a
result
of
work-related
injury
or
disease.”
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
i
wouldn't
say
it
is
exactly
converted.
they
are
two
separate
benefits,
but
at
the
point
of
his
death
he
would
no
longer
receive
permanent
total
disability
benefits
and
if
he
had
survivors
or
wife
or
children
or
both,
they
would
receive
death
benefits
under
the
act.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
that's
correct.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
respondents
submit
that
this
language,
i
just
mentioned
from
section
9
which
is
another
example
of
the
congress
here
treating
death
benefits
in
a
more
expansive
way
that
they
have
been
treated
before.
conclusively
establishes
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
be
bound
by
the
recommendations
of
the
national
commission,
but
rather
intended
to
be
go
beyond
those
recommendations
and
to
establish
what
senator
williams
called
“the
first
serious
step
towards
reform
of
our
society's
workmen's
compensation
laws
in
the
past
50
years.”
turning
to
section
6
(d),
the
section
has
received
a
tremendous
amount
of
attention
in
this
litigation,
respondents
would
submit
that
attention
is
misplaced.
section
6
(d)
when
it
is
read
contains
no
maximum,
that
much
is
clear.
however,
we
believe
that
section
6
(d)
does
have
a
purpose
in
our
feeling
about
that
purpose
is
a
bit
different
from
petitioners'.
we
believe
that
section
6
(d)
is
designed
to
say
that
only
two
classes
of
beneficiaries
will
receive
the
benefit
of
an
increasing
national
average
weekly
wage
under
this
legislation.
we
believe
that
in
affect
it
states
its
point
conversely,
mainly
that
the
lesser
classes
of
disability
do
not
get
the
benefits
of
an
increasing
national
average
weekly
wage.
and
we
believe
that
this
point
can
be
best
illustrated
by
using
the
example
of
a
high
income
temporary
total
disability
individual.
if
he
is
injured
today,
his
benefits
are
easy
to
calculate.
there
is
a
national
average
weekly
wage
in
effect,
his
benefits
are
limited
to
200%
of
that
national
average
weekly
wage.
it's
a
mathematical
calculation.
now,
if
a
person
has
the
same
injury
a
temporary
total
disability
receipt.
next
year
during
the
next
period
and
his
high
income
again
there
is
no
problem
figuring
his
benefits,
it's
the
same
function.
the
only
difference
would
be
that
because
the
national
average
weekly
wage
has
been
going
up
because
of
our
inflationary
society,
his
benefits
will
be
higher.
the
question
becomes
what
happens
to
the
first
example.
if
his
temporary
disability
extends
to
the
next
period,
does
he
get
an
increase
in
his
benefits
or
do
his
benefits
stay
frozen
at
the
level
when
they
are
awarded.
section
6
(b)
does
not
really
explain
that,
section
6
(b)
recites
200%
of
national
average
weekly
wage
is
the
maximum.
we
believe
it
could
be
read
either
way.
that
yes
every
one
goes
up
if
their
benefits
are
based
on
an
national
average
weekly
wage
or
it
could
be
read
at
their
frozen,
it's
an
unclear
point.
section
10
(f)
mentioned
by
the
government
does
not
apply
because
it
only
concerns
by
its
very
nature
permanent
total
disability
and
death
benefits.
it's
designed
to
clarify.
it's
a
mathematical
section
stating
just
how
those
two
classes
of
beneficiaries
will
have
their
befits
enhanced.
we
believe
that
section
6
(d)
is
in
there
to
clarify
that
the
temporary
total
disability
recipient
will
not
get
any
increases.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
section
is
obscure,
it
doesn't
state
its
point
precisely,
we
believed
that
rating
gives
the
section
meaning,
we
believe
it
clarifies
a
point
that
is
not
clarified
otherwise.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
we
believe
that
10
(f)
is
in
there
to
show
that
all
recipients
of
permanent
total
disability
and
death
benefits
will
get
the
increase,
the
benefit
of
an
increase
because
without
that
section
the
only
individuals
that
would
get
an
increase
would
be
those
whose
benefits
are
figured
on
a
national
average
weekly
wage.
in
other
words,
the
middle
range
recipients.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
it
would
perhaps
exclude
the
entire
range
of
them
but
we
would
say
without
6
(d)
the
question
would
still
be
open
in
minimum
and
maximum
situations
where
the
benefits
are
figured
in
disability
on
the
national
average
weekly
wage.
we
don't
think
the
point
is
clear
from
10
(f).
we
believe
in
those
instances
there
might
be
a
question
open
as
to
whether
or
not
an
increase
should
be
granted
and
we
believe
that
as
why
6
(d)
is
in
the
statute.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
well,
i
could
live
with
redundancy
your
honor.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
yes,
that's
true,
that's
certainly
the
question.
if
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
redundancy
though.
we
have
tried
to
find
a
reason
for
6
(d).
it
hasn't
been
easy,
but
we
believe
that
this
is
the
purpose
of
this
section,
we
don't
believe
that
6
(d)
and
10
(f)
are
identical.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
yes.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
i
believe
as
everyone
in
the
case
has
agree
that
there
was
an
oversight
that
should
refer
to
section
6.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
yes,
because
in
that
bill
it
was
a
subsection.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
yes
your
honor,
that
it
is
true
however
we
believe
that
when
the
entire
legislative
history
is
read
here,
the
choices
to
go
what
the
government
called
the
torturous
route
of
finding
through
a
myriad
of
provisions,
a
death
benefit
maximum
or
to
declare
that
the
congress
eliminated
it.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
we
would
not
agree
with
that
your
honor.
we
think
it
is
important
to
realize
at
the
beginning
s.2318
intended
to
remove
all
maximums.
true
and
it
was
revised
we
believe
that
there
was
a
compromise
that
a
new
maximum
was
inserted
in
disability,
but
that
the
congress
decided
in
death
cases
because
it
is
a
different
class
of
benefits
because
there
is
no
incentive
argument
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
a
lower
level
of
benefits
and
with
respect
of
those
the
families
of
workers
they
shouldn't
be
fretted
with
an
arbitrary
ceiling.
the
family
of
a
high
income
worker
should
be
able
to
live
in
the
method
that
they
have
been
accustomed
to
and
that's
more
beneficent
and
more
humane
than
treating
them
in
any
other
way.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
there
was
substantial
testimony
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
the
labor
side
for
instance
was
supportive
of
that
proposal.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
yes,
we
believe
that
for
instance
the
national
commission's
discussions
of
death
in
a
different
light
indicates
that.
the
citation
of
the
enhanced
definition
of
death
benefits
was
something
else
that
was
added
now.
that
wasn't
discussed
in
the
national
commission
nor
to
my
knowledge
was
it
proposed
by
anyone
before
the
congress
and
testimony,
yet
it
was
added
and
it
is
definitely
a
clear
provision.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
i
would
say
affirm,
your
honor
because
i
believe
the
function
of
the
judiciary
is
to
determine
what
the
statute
says
and
what
the
congress
intended.
we
believe
that
if
this
court
is
going
to
find
for
petitioners
it
will
have
to
in
effect
rewrite
this
section
because
there
is
no
death
benefit
maximum
set
out
anywhere
in
the
statute.
language
will
have
to
effectively
be
inserted.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
well,
either
one
your
honor
i
guess
but.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
in
any
event
in
our
estimation
6
(d)
is
designed
to
establish
that
the
lower
classes
of
disability
are
frozen
at
the
level
when
they
are
awarded.
statutory
construction
of
the
statute
has
always
been
beneficent
of
purpose
liberally
construed
in
favor
of
the
worker.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
yes.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
i
think
historically
the
development
of
workmen's
compensation
has
been
to
benefit
the
worker.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
the
benefits
were
enhanced
for
instance
unseaworthiness
doctrine
was
removed
as
an
alternative
remedy,
that
was
one
of
the
trade-offs
and
there
were
others.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
we
believe
that
when
the
statute
is
to
be
construed
by
the
courts,
it
is
to
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
worker
and
his
family
because
that
has
been
the
historical
purpose
of
workmen's
comp
to
create
a
liability
without
fault
against
the
employee.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
i
think
that's
a
very
clear
elimination,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
there
has
to
be
any
construction
of
that
part
of
the
statute,
that's
not
an
issue
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
unseaworthiness
was
eliminated
by
this
act.
mr.
james
buckley
ostmann
in
a
sense
it
created
dual
remedies
for
the
workers,
that's
correct.
it
has
been
said
that
to
remove
death
benefit
maximums
is
too
radical,
too
drastic,
could
not
have
been
intended.
we
believe
though
as
i
just
mentioned
that
the
statute
had
been
radical
from
the
beginning,
that
there
is
other
radical
changes
in
this
act
designed
to
enhance
benefits
for
workers.
further
such
questions
or
questions
of
degree
and
questions
of
policy,
which
we
believe
are
more
properly
presented
to
the
congress
rather
than
this
court.
in
conclusion,
when
reviewing
the
entire
record
surrounding
the
1972
amendments,
we
believe
it
becomes
clear
that
congress
intended
to
truly
modernize
the
statute
and
it
truly
bring
benefits
and
benefit
levels
up
to
a
reasonable
state
and
that
as
a
part
of
this
reasonable
and
beneficent
amendment
of
this
act,
the
congress
consciously
and
purposely
eliminated
any
artificial
limits
on
the
payments
to
the
families
of
deceased
workers.
thank
you.
