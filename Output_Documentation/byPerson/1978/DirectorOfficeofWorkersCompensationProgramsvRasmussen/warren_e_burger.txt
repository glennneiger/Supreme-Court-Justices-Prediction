we
will
here
arguments
next
in
director
of
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
against
rasmussen
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
jones,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
sennett?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
ostmann.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
what
you
want
us
to
draw
from
that
concept?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
counsel
you
have
read
some
of
the
published
articles
of
members
of
the
congress,
which
would
hardly
support
your
suggestion
that
the
--
really
members
the
congress
knew
what
was
in
the
statute
and
how
the
statutory
scheme
worked.
these
experienced
members
of
congress
have
written
published
articles,
they
simply
haven't
the
time
to
gather?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
couple
that
argument
as
i
hear
that
either
express
or
by
implication
that
this
tortured
route
takes
them
to
what
is
the
sensible
and
reasonable
solution
and
did
any
other
route
does
not
produce
the
sensible
and
reasonable
solution
in
light
of
the
total
purposes
of
the
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
with
that
167,
they
would
have
to
divide
all
the
care
for
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
where
we
get
this
concept
of
a
premium
on
death?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
family
was
one
one
fewer
persons
to
support
and
no
medical
bills
gets
almost
three
times
as
much
as
the
family
which
still
has
the
totally
disabled
father
head
of
the
household.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
course
is
that
you
and
the
solicitor
general
argued
that
reading
of
the
statute
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
and
congress
should
not
be
considered
to
help.
we
intended
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
1465
and
1491,
director
of
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
against
rasmussen
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
rehnquist
uses
--
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he
uses
the
wisconsin
pronunciation
of
rasmussen.
i
used
the
minnesota
version.
