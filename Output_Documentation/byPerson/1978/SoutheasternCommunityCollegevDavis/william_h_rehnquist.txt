mr.
gressman,
does
section
504
apply
to
hospitals
as
well
as
schools
if
they
receive
federal
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
result
of
504
and
the
valid
regulations
promulgated
person
to
it
would
be
to
prevent
a
hospital
from
saying
we
will
hire
only
registered
nurses
who
have
become
registered
under
the
north
carolina
laws?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
nothing
in
504
that
would
in
any
way
require
north
carolina
to
alter
its
standards
for
licensing
registered
or
licensed
nurses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
statute
itself
gives
no
indication
of
a
duty
to
undertake
affirmative
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
vacation
was
not
for
purposes
of
seeing
what
accommodation
could
be
made
for
in
the
operating
room,
but
in
the
southeastern
community
college,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
heard
by
mr.
justice
marshall's
questions
to
go
to
her
functioning
in
a
hospital.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
she
under
present
north
carolina
law
be
certified
as
a
registered
nurse?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
district
court
find
against
you
on
that
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
say
you
have
demonstrated
something
in
amicus
briefs,
i
thought
the
place
you
usually
demonstrate
something
in
a
lawsuit
is
in
the
record
before
the
trial
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
isn't
you
are
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
isn't
the
burden
on
you?
and
in
at
the
trial
stage
to
demonstrate
what
you're
talking
about
now
will
be
demonstrated
on
remand?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
district
court
find
that
lpns
perform
their
services
only
under
the
supervision
of
someone
with
superior
medical
training
in
the
immediate
supervision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
the
burden
of
proof,
i
mean
it's
up
to
you
to
persuade
the
district
court
to
ask
the
right
questions
and
introduce
the
evidence
that's
necessary
to
support
your
claim
under
the
law
as
it's
properly
applied.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
do
you
say
the
private
right
of
action
was
originally
created
that
was
then
not
taken
away?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
committee
reports
don't
create
causes
of
action,
its
laws
though,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
some
members,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
that
you
cite
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
cite
borak
versus
j.i.
case
in
your
brief,
do
you
think
that
case
is
still
good
law,
after
amtrak
and
cort
and
barbour?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
feel
you
have
to
rely
on
borak?
