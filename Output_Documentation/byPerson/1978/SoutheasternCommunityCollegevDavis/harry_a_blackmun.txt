mr.
gressman,
she
was
a
licensed
practical
nurse,
was
she
not
for
some
years?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
she
was
unable
to
perform
those
duties
or
that
she
did
so
with
hazard
to
the
patients?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
that
brings
me
to
my
next
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
protects
the
public
when
a
licensed
registered
nurse
becomes
handicapped
as
this
respondent
was
after
her
licensure
had
been
obtained?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
they
fulfilled
in
actual
practice?
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
say
that
licenses
have
been
terminated
or
revoked.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
gressman,
was
the
section
504
pleaded?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
should
ask
you
opposition
this
of
course,
but
i
take
it
you're
not
making
any
point,
and
you
accept
the
presence
of
the
504
issue
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
you're
quite
right
if
it
came
in
at
all.
it
came
in
mighty
indirectly.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
the
operating
room?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
answering
my
question?
now,
mr.
justice
marshall
brought
out
the
fact
that
she
can
perform
with
her
hearing
aid
and
so
long
as
she
is
in
the
position
to
read
lips.
in
the
operating
room,
the
operating
surgeons
wear
masks.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
you
mean
by
the
clinical
setting?
are
you
excluding
the
operating
room
from
the
clinical
setting?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
there
any
registered
nurse
program
that
does
not
take
the
candidates
into
the
operating
room?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no.
