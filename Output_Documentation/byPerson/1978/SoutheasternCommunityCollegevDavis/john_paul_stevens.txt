if
the
respondent
had
been
totally
deaf,
just
stone-deaf,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
level
of
handicap
would
cause
you
to
conclude
that
504
was
inapplicable.
justice

suppose
it
was
an
individual
who
lost
both
hands,
sight
and
capacity
to
hear?

mr.
charmatz,
i'm
still
somewhat
concerned
about
the
posture
of
the
district
judge
when
he
tried
the
case
and
what
your
contentions
were
there.
did
you
take
the
position
in
the
district
court
that
the
hospital
had
a
duty
or
the
program
had
a
duty
to
engage
in
affirmative
action
that
would
change
the
technical
aspects
of
the
program?
i
don't
read
this
pretrial
order
as
describing
your
contentions
in
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
complete
the
educational
program
offered
by
the
college.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
district
court
found
that
she
could
not
because
there
would
be
dangerous
situations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
asked
the
wrong
questions
but
you
didn't
tell
it
to
ask
any
other
questions.
that's
my
problem.
