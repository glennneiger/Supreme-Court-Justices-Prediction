mr.
eugene
gressman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
it
is
a
case
involving
the
interpretation
and
application
of
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973,
which
establishes
a
broad
duty
on
recipients
of
federal
aid
and
assistance.
not
to
discriminate
against
handicapped
persons,
against
qualified
handicapped
persons
solely
because
of
their
handicap.
i
think
it
essential
at
the
outset
to
note
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
discrimination
against
a
handicapped
person.
this
is
a
case
rather
of
a
handicapped
person
who
has
been
found
not
qualified
to
participate
in
the
program
or
activity
to
which
she
sought
admission.
the
uncontested
facts
as
found
by
the
district
court
after
an
evidentiary
hearing,
facts
and
findings
which
have
not
been
challenged
in
the
lower
courts
or
essentially
before
this
court
established
that
the
respondent,
frances
davis,
by
concession
had
a
severe
hearing
handicap
which
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
communicate
with
other
people
other
than
with
the
use
of
a
hearing
aid
and
the
ability
and
necessity
to
read
the
lips
of
the
person
to
whom
she
is
talking.
and
she
must
apparently
be
face
to
face
with
the
talker.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
essentially
the
finding
implicit
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
yes.
it
was
a
combination
though
of
the
hearing
handicap
--
of
i
mean
the
hearing
aid
plus
the
necessity
to
read
lips,
and
even
then
that
was
found
to
be
an
inadequate
compensation
for
the
severity
of
a
hearing
handicap.
now
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
apparently
about
10
years
previously.
mr.
eugene
gressman
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
we
do
not
know
for
example
even
whether
her
hearing
handicap
was
that
severe
at
the
time
she
acquired
the
lpn
license.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
yes.
under
the
north
carolina
statutes,
the
state
licensing
bureau
is
authorize
to
revoke
any
license
it
has
previously
granted
because
of
incompetent
or
inadequate
nursing
practice
under
any
license,
whether
it
be
an
lpn
license
or
an
rn
license.
that
is
very
clearly
set
forth
in
the
statutes.
that's
a
--
i
would
assume
that's
a
fairly
universal
provision
with
respect
to
any
licensing
activity.
mr.
eugene
gressman
you
mean
if
they
have
lifted
licenses
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
there's
nothing
in
this
record,
no.
this
is
solely
a,
you
might
say
an
ad
hoc
factual
development
solely
related
to
this
particular
individual.
we
have
no
evidence
as
to
the
general
practices
of
the
licensing
authorities.
now
the
court
made
the
critical
determinations,
in
terms
of
this
respondent's
lack
of
qualifications
either
to
participate
in
the
training
program
or
in
her
ultimate
profession
as
a
registered
nurse.
the
court
specifically
found
that
her
hearing
handicap
actually
prevents
her
from
safely
performing
in
both
her
training
program
and
her
proposed
registered
nurse
profession.
and
the
court
found
and
concluded
that
there
are
numerous
situations
where
her
hearing
disability
would
render
her
unable
to
function
properly
in
a
clinical
situation,
in
a
nurse-patient
relationship.
and
finally,
the
court
emphasized
that
was
a
particular
concern
to
this
court
was
the
potential
danger
to
the
patients
in
the
hospitals
who
would
be
unable
to
in
many
situations
communicate
effectively
with
this
particular
nurse-trainee
or
ultimately
the
professional
nurse.
many
patients
obviously
are
not
incapable
of
addressing
the
nurse
face
to
face
so
that
their
lips
could
be
read,
or
there
might
be
situations
where
various
crises
develop
that
could
only
be
--
that
could
not
be
heard
by
the
nurse
who
had
her
back
turned
to
in
a
particular
situation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
but
in
the
nurses
training
program,
they
only
have
this
clinical
programs
in
the
hospital.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
could
be
discriminatory
under
504
even
in
that
employment
relationship,
if
you
decline
to
employ
a
qualified
handicapped
person
solely
because
of
his
handicap.
mr.
eugene
gressman
federal
financial
aid,
that's
right.
now
there
are
other
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
you
mean
the
individual
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
would
assume
not
that
that's
no
form
of
state
action
which
any
kind
of
a
statute
could
reach
as
essential
basis
for
imposing
any
kind
of
anti-discrimination
policy.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
there
are
yes.
in
employment
situations
where
the
employer
has
a
contractual
relationship
with
the
federal
government
and
--
or
with
the
state.
and
as
a
condition
to
the
maintenance
of
that
contractual
relationship,
they
may
be
prohibited
from
refusing
to
employ
a
handicapped
person
who
is
qualified
solely
because
of
his
handicap.
but
you
would
have
to
have
some
relationship
with
a
government
agency
or
program
either
through
contract
or
through
expressed
coverage.
but
as
far
as
a
purely
private
individual
who's
ill
at
home,
i
would
assume
that
there
is
nothing
to
prohibit
that
person
from
discriminating
as
to
whom
he
wants
to
employ
as
a
nurse.
mr.
eugene
gressman
if
it's
a
federally
funded
program
of
some
sort,
yes.
now,
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
you
have
something
of
that
problem,
i
understand,
in
the
pending
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
(inaudible)
case
where
the
--
a
private
hospital
allegedly
discriminated
and
refused
to
hire
a
handicapped
nurse.
now
there
are
cases
of
that
nature
where
the
--
if
the
hospital
is
in
some
way
related
to
a
federally
funded
program
for
employment
purposes,
that
hospital
would
be
subject
to
504.
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
in
a
bit,
not
in
one
--
in
any
way
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
504
is
a
very
broad
in
scope
and
it
makes
no
pretense
at
revising
or
altering
or
conditioning
state
licensing
laws
that
may
be
appropriate
for
certain
professions
that
happened
to
involve
handicapped
persons.
but
the
--
there
is
no
--
not
a
word
on
the
face
of
the
statute
or
its
intent
or
purpose
that
would
indicate
that
congress
meant
to
revise
or
alter
the
reasonable
and
necessary
state
licensing
laws
with
respect
to
the
practice
of
nursing
by
registered
nurses
who
are
qualified
and
capable
of
fully
performing
safe
nursing
practices.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
to
complete
the
training
program?
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
she
could
not
effectively
complete
the
training
program
because
of
her
handicap.
the
state
licensing
bureau
head
who
wrote
a
letter,
it's
in
the
record,
said
that
she
could
not
exactly
predict
what
would
be
the
situation
two
or
three
years
hence
when
this
person,
if
she
got
through
the
training
program,
would
then
be
eligible
to
take
a
licensing
examination.
but
she
said
that
on
the
basis
of
her
present
knowledge,
she
assumed
that
it
would
be
improper
and
perhaps
run
undue
risk
to
permit
her
to
participate
in
the
training
program.
and
the
likelihood
was
that
if
this
condition
remained
the
same
after
she
were
to
have
completed
her
training
program,
there
would
be
a
serious
question
whether
they
would
let
her
take
the
licensing
examination.
you
see,
the
licensing
authorities
do
not
have
any
independent
sifting
out
process.
they
simply
take
the
graduates
of
the
nursing
schools
that
have
been
certified
to
them
as
fully
competent,
fully
qualified
nurses
--
nurse
candidates
who
are
completely
able
to
fulfill
all
the
requirements
that
a
registered
nurse
must
have.
and
they
simply
take
that
and
allow
them
on
basis
to
that
certification
from
an
accredited
nursing
program
to
take
the
licensing
exam,
and
if
they
--
which
is
simply
a
written
examination,
there
is
no
physical
test
made
by
the
licensing
authorities,
then
that
person
if
she
passes
the
written
examination
is
given
a
rn
license.
now,
i
think
it's
essential
to
see
how
the
structure
of
section
504
comes
into
play
at
this
point.
it's
a
very
simple
proposition.
the
opening
words
of
504
say
that
“no
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
individual
shall
solely
by
reason
of
his
handicap
be
excluded
from
participation
or
otherwise
discriminated
against
in
any
federally
funded
program
or
activity.”
now,
the
essential
predicate
in
other
words
for
504
coming
into
operation
at
all
is
that
the
person
be
otherwise
qualified.
those
are
the
predicate
words
that
bring
504
into
operation.
unless
you
have
a
qualified
handicapped
person,
you
can
never
have
the
kind
of
discrimination
against
that
person
that
504
is
talking
about.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true
your
honor
and
that
is
really
the
problem
but
in
this
case.
but
i
think
however
you
view
the
words
otherwise
qualified,
it
is
essential
to
understand
that
504
is
not
talking
about
the
unqualified
handicapped
person,
otherwise
or
not.
the
qualification
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
nobody
not
with
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
that's
what
we
call
the
absurd
reading
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
the
literal
reading
of
that
language
produces
the
impossible
situation,
and
that
is
that
you
have
to
disregard
all
kinds
of
handicaps.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
in
terms
--
and
omit
them
to
perform
the
most
physically
demanding
jobs
or
activities
known
to
man.
now
this
cannot
be.
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
course
your
honor.
now,
i
think
this
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
true
and
i
always
like
to
think
of
the
example
of
a
law
school
who
freely
admits
blind
people,
deaf
people,
paraplegics
primarily
because
there
is
no
physical
qualification
for
entering
into
an
academic
type
program
of
that
nature.
now
therefore,
you
have
to
approach
this
whole
problem
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
you
have
to
look
at
the
qualifications
for
a
particular
activity.
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
nature
of
the
handicap
and
see
whether
that
is
relevant
to
the
qualifications,
and
you
have
to
look
at
--
determine
whether
ultimately
there's
been
discrimination
against
the
person
once
he
has
been
determined
he
is
qualified.
we
never
get
to
that
point
in
this
case
because
we
never
got
above
--
beyond
the
predicate
requirement
that
the
person
be
otherwise
qualified.
now,
the
pro
problem
in
this
case
is
one
of
confusion,
and
i
think
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
these
words
otherwise
qualified
had
a
rather
ambiguous
note
to
them.
but
i
think
the
whole
thing
becomes
crystal
clear
if
you
understand
that
there
are
two
basic
kinds
of
programs
or
activities
that
may
be
funded
by
the
federal
government.
the
broad
type
of
programs
that
are
covered
are
the
academic
type
programs
running
from
preschool
education
to
primary
schools,
secondary
schools
and
post
graduates
--
and
post
secondary
schools,
the
great
mass
of
the
undergraduate
collegiate
programs,
95%
of
which
i
assume
would
be
largely
academic
in
nature.
in
those
types
of
programs
which
are
the
great
mass
that
are
covered
by
504,
there
ordinarily
are
not
any
physical
qualifications.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
exactly
true
and
504
regulations
issued
by
hew
do
require
that
certain
kinds
of
auxiliary
aids
and
assistance
be
given
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
the
regulations
under
this
statute,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
--
well
this
was
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it's
referred
to
in
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
of
the
law
here
that
on
remand
of
this
case,
the
court
should
give
consideration
to
certain
hew
regulations
which
required;
one,
auxiliary
aids
to
be
provided
for
the
handicapped
person,
or
two,
to
make
modifications
in
the
academic
programs.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
your
honor.
they
were
promulgated
in
1977.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
it
does
not
your
honor,
and
this
is
in
direct
contrast
with
the
preceding
two
sections,
501
and
503.
501
relates
to
federal
employees,
503
relates
to
government
contractors
who
employ
individuals
that
may
be
handicapped,
and
both
of
those
cases
congress
specifically
says
that
affirmative
action
and
accommodation
shall
be
made
in
the
course
of
enforcing
that
non-discrimination
policy.
mr.
eugene
gressman
your
honor
is
exactly
right.
there
is
not
one
word
on
the
face
of
504
that
establishes
any
duty
to
make
affirmative
accommodation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
at
this
point,
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
don't
arrive
at
that
point
yet
in
this
case.
that
you
would
make
affirmative
accommodation
if
at
all
only
if
you
have
an
otherwise
qualified
individual,
in
a
program
or
activity
where
no
physical
qualifications
are
at
issue
and
where
the
handicap
does
not
affect
his
qualification.
mr.
eugene
gressman
in
the
district
court?
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
it
was.
there
was
an
alternative
claim
under
1983
which
was
a
constitutional
claim.
but
then
there
was
the
statutory
claim
which
requested
that
she
be
admitted.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
there
is
a
--
it
came
in
rather
obliquely
i
believe
in
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
the
--
particularly
in
the
--
there
is
a
several
references
to
it
in
some
of
the
preliminary
pleadings
in
this
case,
but
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
that
that
was
an
elaboration
clarification
of
her.
i
don't
think
the
complaint
was
all
that
clearly
drawn
frankly,
and
i
think
it
became
clarified
in
the
pretrial
proceedings
in
the
order.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
i
will
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
i
would
say
one
final
word
as
to
the
interpretation
of
504.
it
simply
does
not
apply
in
my
judgment
to
any
a
cause
of
action
which
involves
a
person
who
is
found
not
to
be
qualified.
and
i
think
that
the
person
who
is
not
qualified
in
a
--
for
a
participation
in
a
clinical
program
raises
a
most
serious
policy
considerations,
because
once
you
leave
the
academic
area
where
physical
qualifications
are
no
longer
an
issue,
indeed
they
do
be
--
go
into
the
clinical
areas
where
physical
qualifications
may
be
important
to
the
public
safety,
health
and
welfare.
then
it
seems
to
me
you
are
outside
the
intended
scope
of
the
language
and
the
purpose
of
504.
now,
we
have
in
this
situation
a
reflection
of
this
concern
by
the
district
court
for
the
safety
of
the
patients.
and
i
think
that
a
person
who
is
unqualified
to
provide
safe
nursing
care
for
the
great
mass
of
individuals
who
are
ill
and
sick
raises
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
this
504
duty
should
be
imposed
indiscriminately
upon
that
kind
of
program
or
activity.
congress
has
from
the
very
beginning
established
a
policy
that
is
very
much
in
point
here,
and
i
refer
to
the
statutes
in
my
reply
brief
that
under
the
nurse
training
act
of
1964
which
provides
for
financial
assistance
to
nursing
schools,
and
which
is
the
very
assistance
that
was
given
to
southeastern
community
college
in
this
case.
that
is
why
it
is
federally
funded.
it
was
federally
funded
to
provide
safe
nursing
practice
and
training.
but
congress
in
that
act
said
that
in
no
event
shall
there
be
any
condition
or
imposition
by
the
federal
authorities
of
any
changes
in
the
curriculum.
in
other
words,
any
kind
of
affirmative
accommodation
that
your
honor
spoke
of
a
few
minutes
ago.
they
were
concerned
that
you
maintain
the
quality
and
the
safety
of
nurse
training
programs,
and
there
was
to
be
no
interference
with
changing
the
curricular
or
the
administration
of
this
highly
important
and
high
risk
type
of
clinical
training
programs
in
the
nursing
school.
and
congress
has
also
told
us
in
another
statute
in
the
education
amendments
of
1974
that
if
the
handicapped
people
want
to
participate
in
these
kinds
of
clinical
programs,
congress
authorizes
grants
and
expenditures
to
community
colleges
and
other
institutions
to
establish
specially
designed
programs
for
the
seriously
handicapped
who
can
not
be
qualified
in
terms
of
the
ordinary
program.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
would
say
as
to
the
implied
cause
of
action,
your
honor,
that
not
only
has
it
been
fully
briefed
but
i
would
emphasize
what
i
think
is
the
conclusive
factor
in
that
respect.
in
1978
the
rehabilitation
act
was
amended
to
provide
for
two
specific
kinds
of
private
causes
of
action
with
respect
to
it
the
federal
employees
and
those
who
are
employed
by
the
a
recipient
funds
in
a
narrow
employment
context
where
the
primary
purpose
of
the
grant
is
to
foster
and
provide
for
creating
employment
relationships.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
specificity
with
which
it
authorized
private
causes
of
action
in
those
two
instances
by
necessary
implication
reads
out
any
kind
of
private
cause
of
action
for
other
situations
such
as
we
have
here.
since
we
do
have
a
federal
employee
or
do
we
have
an
employment
type
situation,
congress
has
said
as
clearly
as
it
can,
i
assume
that
there
are
to
be
no
other
types
of
private
causes
of
action.
otherwise,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
language
--
in
the
history
of
504
that
permits
the
standards
of
the
--
that
permits
and
implication
of
a
private
cause
of
action.
there
are
a
few
isolated
statements
by
senators
and
perhaps
by
a
committee
or
two
unrelated
in
time
to
the
original
enactment
of
this
statute
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
the
1978
amendments
do
make
a
vital
difference
or
distinction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
except
i
think
there
may
be
some
differences
perhaps
with
respect
to
a
spending
program
and
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
you
are
dealing
with
an
enormous
regulatory
system
that
has
been
developed
in
the
hew.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
you
mean
504?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
i'm
not
aware
your
honor
that
this
court
or
any
court
has
ever
addressed
this
problem
which
i
assume
has
been
raised
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
here
as
to
whether
you
can
have
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
premise
upon
a
violation
of
another
statute
which
gives
no
cause
of
action
in
and
of
itself.
now,
i
think
this
is
a
highly
dangerous
or
questionable
doctrine,
because
that
would
mean
that
you
could
create
--
under
1983
assuming
some
kind
of
state
action,
you
could
create
causes
of
action
under
the
--
all
the
provisions
of
the
united
states
code,
regardless
of
whether
courts
had
held
that
there
is
no
right
of
action
under
a
specific
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
exactly
right,
exactly
right.
so
i
think
it's
somewhat
a
circular
and
self-defeating
proposition
in
the
end.
all
i
can
say
is
that
there
is
absolutely
no
authority
at
least
in
this
court
for
permitting
to
raise
yourself
up
by
the
bootstraps
by
using
the
1983
cause
of
action
to
create
a
cause
of
action
that
doesn't
otherwise
exist.
mr.
eugene
gressman
alright.
your
honor,
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
have
leave
to
reply
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief?
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
was,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
would
like
to
file
a
very
brief
reply
to
that.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
indeed.
