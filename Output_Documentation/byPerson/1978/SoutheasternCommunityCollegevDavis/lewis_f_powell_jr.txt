justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gressman,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
there
are
two
separate
things
that
she
might
not
be
qualified
to
do.
one
is
to
be
a
registered
nurse
because
it
might
be
dangerous
for
her
if
she
couldn't
hear
properly,
and
secondly
she
might
not
be
able
to
do
this
study
program
adequately.
now,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
district
court
found
that
she
could
not
do
either?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
some
of
the
findings
are
ambiguous
but
my
interpretation
of
it
was
that
they
--
the
district
court
found
that
she
could
not
progress
satisfactorily
with
the
training
because
when
upon
completion
of
the
program,
she
could
not
safely
perform
her
duties
as
a
nurse.
do
you
also
read
the
finding
as
saying
if
you
put
to
one
side
how
she
perform
as
a
nurse,
she
still
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
the
--
to
complete
the
program
because
she
was
unable
to
hear?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
challenge
the
validity
of
the
regulations
in
so
far
as
their
promulgated
pursuant
to
section
504?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gressman,
are
you
going
to
address
the
implied
cause
of
action
point?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
time
is
getting
a
bit
short.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
charmatz,
on
the
question
of
the
clinical
program
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
asking
about,
the
district
court
found
that
from
the
evidence
presented
at
trial
appears
to
be
difficult
and
in
fact
dangerous
for
plaintiff
to
even
attempt
the
clinical
portion
of
the
training
program.
do
you
challenge
that
finding?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
challenge
that
finding?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course
at
the
time
of
the
district
court
decision,
was
there
a
regulation
that
raised
this
question
with
the
district
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
the
district
court
at
that
time
didn't
ask
the
wrong
question
what
you
are
in
effect
arguing
that
later
regulations
raised
a
question
that
they
should've
anticipated,
the
district
court
judge
should've
anticipated.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
means,
if
i
understand
you,
that
it's
qualified
to
perform
the
technical
requirements
if
the
technical
requirements
were
somewhat
different?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
means
that
he
has
to
be
able
to
perform
the
technical
aspects
of
the
program
if
they
were
somewhat
different
than
they
are.
that's
what
it
means
under
your
view
as
i
understand
it.
