justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
--
your
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
gressman,
isn't
it
your
case
on
that
isn't
any
stronger
than
it
would
be
under
title
6
is
it?
except
for
the
1978
amendments,
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
absent
though,
your
case
is
no
stronger
than
it
would
be
under
title
6
or
9,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this.
put
aside
the
1978
amendments
for
the
moment.
this
is
a
state
agency
we
have
the
state
involved
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
even
if
there
were
not
a
private
cause
of
action
that
would
arose
directly
under
title
5
that
you
might
be
able
to
state
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
relying
on
title
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes.
i
mean
--
yes
on
504,
under
the
end
laws
of
provision
of
1983.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
could
i
ask,
what
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
meant
when
it
said
“we
vacate
and
remand
that
portion
of
the
district
court
judgment
which
has
not
been
affirmed
here
and
hold
that
the
college
must
reconsider
plaintiff's
application
for
admission
to
the
nursing
program
without
regard
to
her
hearing
disability.”
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that
means
that
you
put
that
aside
entirely.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
isn't
the
way
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
look
at
the
technical.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
this
--
you
don't
suggest
then
that
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
court
of
appeals
meant
to
say
that
if
the
--
if
this
person
satisfies
the
academic
and
technical
requirements,
she
is
automatically
admitted
to
the
program.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
--
if
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
meant,
you
think
it
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
it
meant
by
technical?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
meant
hearing,
it
didn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it
couldn't
have
or
you
would
be
out
of
court
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
the
hew
construction
would
be
right
in
your
teeth.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
i
gather
you
can
see
then
that
there
wouldn't
be
automatic
admission
just
because
academic
and
requirements
were
satisfied,
and
the
technical
requirements
as
you
understand
were
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
hew
construes
qualified
in
otherwise
qualified
to
be
exactly
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't
that
--
that
is
not
the
way
you
read
otherwise
qualified,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
suppose
it
were
concluded
on
remand
that
the
--
this
lady
could
not
perform
at
all
in
the
operating
room
that
it
would
be
just
--
we're
trying
to
see
if
there
can
be
an
accommodation
between
the
demands
of
the
operating
room
and
being
deaf
to
this
degree.
and
the
answer
is
no,
there
can't
be
any
accommodation.
but
all
that
means
is
that
she
shouldn't
be
performing
in
an
operating
room.
would
you
suggest
that
she
nevertheless
should
be
in
the
training
program
because
she
can
perform
in
every
other
context?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
court
of
appeals
thought
the
issue
was
properly
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
--
the
way
you
read
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
the
issue
was
here.
