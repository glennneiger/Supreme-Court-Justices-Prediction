mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
frances
davis
is
a
licensed
practical
nurse.
she
seeks
to
enroll
in
the
southeastern
community
college
nursing
program,
and
to
advance
in
her
education,
and
to
reach
her
full
potential.
she
is
a
hearing-impaired
woman
but
the
college
has
refused
to
give
her
that
opportunity
solely
on
the
basis
of
her
hearing
impairment,
with
that
any
consideration
of
possible
program
modifications
to
be
made
in
this
case.
the
college
position
as
stated
in
its
reply
brief
is
clear.
nurse
trainees
must
be
drawn
from
the
national
pool
of
those
who
are
able-bodied
in
the
fullest
physical
sense.
applying
this
criteria
to
mrs.
davis,
we
have
the
situation
as
indicated
in
the
reply
brief
that
the
college
has
applied
the
rule
saying
that
mrs.
davis
must
possess
hearing
to
the
fullest
degree
without
substantial
impairment
in
order
to
qualify.
quite
frankly,
your
honor,
this
would
apply
to
mrs.
davis
as
an
lpn,
and
under
this
status,
under
this
way
of
looking
at
it,
mrs.
davis
would
not
have
the
opportunity
to
be
an
lpn
where
she
is
safely
and
efficiently
functioned
now
for
12
years.
it
has
been
assumed
by
the
college
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
we
do
mr.
justice.
the
audiologist
report
indicates
that
mrs.
davis
has
sustained
the
hearing
loss
for
many
years.
the
pre-entrance
medical
examine
also
indicates
that
mrs.
davis
has
some
decrease
in
hearing.
but
the
preemptions
medical
examine
found
her
physically
and
mentally
qualified
to
undertake
the
nursing
program.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
pardon.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
it
has
been
assumed
by
the
college
that
people
with
hearing
impairments
which
can
not
be
fully
corrected,
people
with
impairments
similar
or
worst
than
mrs.
davis'
cannot
function
as
a
nurse.
and
it's
precisely
this
assumption
which
congress
has
recognized
is
incorrect
in
acting
section
504.
the
assumption
that
a
hearing
impaired
person
can
not
be
a
nurse.
the
federal
government
employs
over
150
impaired
nurses
and
over
300
nursing
assistants.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
no.
but
the
audiologist
report
indicates
that
mrs.
davis
is
successful
in
communicating
with
people.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
it
said
that
she
can.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
and
she
--
and
her
hearing
aid
improves
her
hearing.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
well,
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
vacated
and
remanded
the
decision
of
the
district
court
to
ask
what
accommodations
could
be
made
for
mrs.
davis,
and
what
accommodations
would
be
necessary
in
that
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
we
do
not
object
to
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
no.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
well
from
the
record
we
the
statement
of
the
nursing
director
at
southeastern
community
hospital
who
indicated
that
she
did
not
know
any
area
that
mrs.
davis
couldn't
function
given
her
present
determination
to
continue
her
education.
and
indeed,
mrs.
davis
at
the
present
time
obviously
can't
function
in
any
capacity
as
a
registered
nurse
and
by
going
into
the
clinical
program
she
attempts
to
advance
her
education
so
that
she
could
function
in
areas
as
a
registered
nurse.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
we
think
that
we
might
not
have
to
reach
that
question
but
that
the
indication
is
that
she
could.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
no,
i
think
the
district
court
found
that
the
feelings
of
the
college
that
she
couldn't
be
a
registered
nurse
were
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
college
refused
her.
but
the
report
from
the
nursing
director
is
very
difficult
to
understand.
at
one
point,
it
certainly
indicates
that
there
may
be
some
problems
from
mrs.
davis.
no
question
about
that
from
the
report.
but
at
another
point
in
the
nursing
statement,
it
indicates
that
mrs.
davis
might
not
be
licensed
as
a
licensed
practical
nurse.
and
what
has
happened
since
this
--
her
application,
she
has
been
re-licensed
by
the
state
as
a
licensed
practical
nurse.
and
at
the
end
of
course
the
nursing
director
for
the
state
said
that
they
could
not
predict
the
eligibility
because
the
eligibility
would
be
determined
on
how
she
does
in
the
clinical
program.
we
have
also
demonstrated
in
amicus
briefs
that
there
are
a
number
of
areas
where
hearing
impaired
and
handicapped
citizens
perform
safely
and
effectively
in
the
medical
community,
functioning
in
hospitals
as
hearing-impaired
people.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
it
is
obvious
that
hearing-impaired
people
can
perform
in
hospital
situations.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
well,
the
question
is
that
mrs.
davis
has
performed
as
a
licensed
practical
nurse
where
she
is
in
contact
with
patients.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
the
operating
room?
again,
we
have
to
look
at
it
in
terms
of
the
clinical
aspect
of
the
program
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
clinical
aspect
can
be
accommodated.
the
indication
is,
and
again
we
have
to
see
what
hearing-impaired
people
are
doing
is
that
they
are
performing
in
the
operating
room,
because
they've
received
from
their
clinical
instruction
they've
received
training,
they've
received
evaluation,
and
they
received
supervision.
and
this
is
an
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
the
question
of
whether
or
not
she
can
perform
in
the
operating
room
may
be
premature
that
we
first
have
to
see
how
she
would
perform
in
the
clinical
setting.
the
question
also
is
what
accommodations
might
be
made
to
enable
her
to
perform
in
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
no.
we
have
to
--
i
think
it
has
to
be
identified
what
are
the
essential
parts
of
the
clinical
program,
which
has
not
yet
been
done
here,
and
which
would
be
proper
on
vacating
and
remanding.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
the
question
is
though,
the
problem
was
that
the
college
refused
to
make
any
modification
and
that
was
their
position.
and
the
district
court
accepted
that
the
college
refused
to
make
any
modification.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
in
the
statute
doesn't
say.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
in
the
statute,
it
does
not
say.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
in
the
legislative
history
to
section
504
in
the
same
legislative
history
of
the
same
congress
that
enacted
section
504,
the
committee
reports
indicate
that
section
504
is
meant
to
have
a
requirement
of
affirmative
relief.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
no.
but
with
the
legislative
history
and
also
the
hew
regulation
which
has
gone
through
congressional
oversight
hearings
and
again
the
1978
amendments
there
are
no
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
we
suggest
that
it
is
a
broadly-worded
statute
that
is
similar
to
title
6
and
to
title
9,
and
in
the
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
we
think
in
terms
of
an
otherwise
qualified
individual,
it
is
one
that
hew
found
required
a
number
of
different
definitions,
because
of
the
different
program
activities.
but
the
purpose
of
section
504
is
to
avoid
the
exclusion
to
make
modifications
that's
found
by
hew,
that's
found
in
the
senate
--
senate
reports
to
section
504.
the
legislative
history
is
that
handicapped
people
can
not
be
excluded
on
the
basis
of
stereotypes
and
can
not
be
excluded
because
of
failures
to
make
modifications.
and
in
particular,
one
senate
report
states
“special
attention
must
be
paid
to
the
needs
of
those
individuals
who
through
no
fault
of
their
own
have
not
received
adequate
education.
these
individuals,
young
adults
and
adults
alike
must
be
afforded
the
equal
opportunity
and
access
to
higher
educational
services.”
the
committee
as
we
at
the
present
time
most
of
these
avenues
have
not
been
available
to
people
with
handicaps.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
we
think
that
the
district
court
asked
the
wrong
questions.
that
the
one
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
we
can't
say
that
it's
--
we
do
not
allege
that
the
findings
are
clearly
erroneous.
but
we
think
that
asked
the
wrong
questions,
one
in
accommodation
and
two,
certainly
consideration
of
whether
mrs.
davis
as
a
licensed
practical
nurse
should
enter
into
the
picture.
here
a
woman
could
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
the
hew
regulation
was
promulgated
in
june
of
1977.
and
the
district
court
hearing
was
in
october
of
1976.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that
and
also
that
from
the
legislative
history
it
seems
that
you
should
also
consider
accommodation
questions
which
were
not
asked
by
the
district
court.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision,
a
very
narrow
one,
started
on
statutory
grounds
rather
than
constitutional
grounds
recognizes
that
a
prejudgment
on
solely
on
disability
is
incorrect.
and
first,
the
fourth
circuit
is
saying
“look
at
the
admission
standards,
the
academic
standards
to
see
if
they
can
be
considered
so
that
we
do
not
screen
out
handicapped
individuals.”
if
the
decision
is
in
the
affirmative,
then
we
have
to
look
to
see
if
there
are
program
modifications
that
can
be
made.
if
the
person
does
not
meet
the
academic
standards,
well
the
person
will
not
be
admitted.
if
the
person
--
if
there
is
no
program
modification
to
be
made,
then
the
person
may
not
be
admitted.
but
the
point
is
that
we
have
to
at
least
consider
those,
and
in
this
case
that
was
not
done.
i
think
this
approach
is
it
consisted
with
section
504,
its
legislative
history,
and
consistent
with
the
hew
regulation?
the
college
position
as
found
by
the
fourth
circuit
was
no
modification.
they
didn't
consider
that
issue
and
the
fourth
circuit
suggested
that
they
give
close
attention
on
remand
to
it.
at
that
point
they
would
also
--
should
be
consideration
of
the
academic
standards
which
were
not
considered
at
all
in
this
case.
i
think
even
the
amicus,
the
american
association
of
medical
colleges,
recognizes
that
the
sole
focus
on
disability
conducted
by
the
college
and
conducted
by
the
district
court
was
inappropriate,
because
the
district
court
did
not
consider
the
issue
of
accommodation,
and
because
the
district
court
did
not
consider
the
academic
standards
in
this
case.
there's
no
indication
and
in
fact
i
think
the
record
reveals
that
an
evaluation
of
whether
mrs.
davis
was
a
licensed
practical
nurse
did
not
enter
into
the
evaluation
in
this
case.
in
addition,
it
would
seem
that
mrs.
davis
as
a
person
who
is
licensed
for
now
12
years,
may
be
an
ideal
candidate
to
be
able
to
participate
in
a
registered
nurse
program.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
that's
correct
that
they
do
perform
their
training
under
the
supervision
of
a
registered
nurse.
in
fact,
there's
a
north
carolina
statute
which
defines
the
duties
of
a
licensed
practical
nurse
and
defines
the
duties
of
a
registered
nurse.
and
certainly,
the
duties
of
a
licensed
practical
nurse
include
patient
care.
there's
a
degree
in
responsibility
and
supervision
which
is
really
the
key
difference
between
a
registered
nurse
and
a
licensed
practical
nurse.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
it
means
that
you
look
at
the
academic
standards
first.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
and
you
see
if
the
person
meets
the
academic
standards
without
regard
to
disability.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
and
then
you
look
at
the
technical
or
actual
program.
and
then
you
see
whether
or
not
the
program
can
be
accommodated.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
no.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
well
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
meant
that
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
it
meant
by
technical
work
experience
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
no.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
right.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
we
think
that
that
is
the
appropriate
consideration.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
well,
we
think
that
that
should
be
construed
in
terms
of
the
accommodation.
it
would
be
silly
for
example
to
have
a
lawyer
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
if
it
means
everything?
yes.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
except
that
when
we
look
at
the
technical,
we
have
to
look
to
see
if
there
can
be
accommodations.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
right,
there
would
not
be
an
automatic
admission.
i
do
not
think
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
reads
that
all
handicapped
people
must
be
admitted
into
programs.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
they
do.
i
think
they
indicate
that
they
do.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
well,
we
read
otherwise
qualified
or
qualified
handicapped
person
to
be
one
that
can
perform
the
academic
and
technical
standards.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
not
despite
his
handicap,
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
it
doesn't.
it
does
not
mean
the
blind
bus
driver.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
no.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
it
may
--
that
does
not
mean
the
blind
bus
driver.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
that
we
would.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
well
the
question
--
the
initial
question
would
be
whether
or
not
he
meets
the
academic
requirements.
and
the
second
question
would
be
whether
or
not
there
can
be
any
accommodation
to
him.
i
would
doubt
seriously
that
there
could
be
accommodation
in
that
situation
and
therefore
the
person
would
not
be
admitted.
just
as
the
way
we
look
at
the
blind
bus
driver,
whether
he
could
perform
the
essential
functions
of
a
job
as
blind
bus
driver
is
the
initial
question.
i
wouldn't
think
he
could.
and
the
second
question
is
whether
there'd
be
an
accommodation,
and
again
i
don't
think
he
could.
the
conclusion
that
we
draw
in
this
case
is
that
the
college
in
this
instance
was
blind
to
the
ability
of
handicapped
people
to
perform
such
as
mrs.
davis,
and
to
contribute
meaningfully
to
society.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
we
are.
i
mean
i
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
that
issue
here
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
we
are
--
i
think
that
if
that
were
the
case,
we
would
say
that
there
are
many
opportunities
available
to
handicapped
citizens
and
as
registered
nurses,
and
they
should
be
able
to
participate.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct,
or
the
doctor's
office
or
a
private
duty
nursing
or
a
number
of
other
settings.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
well,
again
i
think
that
that's
correct.
they
have
to
check
on
the
adaptability
of
these
activities.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
don't
think
we
concede
that
point.
i
think
that
given
the
testimony
or
given
the
evidence
of
the
director
of
southeastern
community
hospital
and
given
the
examples
that
are
in
the
amicus
of
people
who
are
severely
hearing
impaired
performing
in
the
operating
room
that
we
have
--
that
the
question
is
open.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
that
you're
not
obliged
to
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
that
since
the
district
court
asked
the
wrong
questions
that
the
matter
should
be
vacated
or
remanded.
i
think
you
may
be
restricted
to
the
record,
but
in
so
far
as
the
record
indicates
that
the
questions
that
the
district
court
asked
and
that
the
college
asked
were
incorrect.
i
think
that
is
the
basis
of
the
fourth
circuit
decision.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
we
have
the
burden
of
proof,
but
we
--
but
when
the
both
the
college
and
the
district
court
would
not
consider
modifications
there
was
for
mrs.
davis,
the
only
efforts
is
what
she
did.
she
tried
her
best
she
could
to
give
the
information
about
here
abilities
and
as
an
lpn
from
the
information
from
the
hospital
that
she
worked
at.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
i
think
that
the
inquiry
and
testimony
was
whether
or
not
with
adequate
supervision
mrs.
davis
could
perform
the
duties
in
the
clinical
program.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
but
the
district
court
found
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
but
the
district
court,
again
has
said
that
as
far
as
accommodations
were
concerned,
even
a
supervision
was
concerned
they
weren't
going
to
consider
it.
and
that
was
the
problem
of
the
college.
the
college
said
“well
was
that
a
good
supervision,
maybe
mrs.
davis
can
perform
but
we're
not
going
to
make
adequate
supervision.
we're
not
going
to
do
that.”
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
and
i
want
to
speak
just
briefly
on
private
right
of
action,
because
it
was
addressed
by
the
court.
the
amendments
referred
to
indicate
in
any
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
or
charge
a
violation
of
a
provision
of
title
5,
the
court
may
allow
attorney's
fees
to
enforce
or
charge
a
violation.
in
addition,
the
committee
reports
indicate
that
the
committee
believes
that
handicapped
individuals
under
title
5
are
and
will
remain
in
need
of
vigilance
by
handicapped
individuals
to
assure
compliance
and
the
availability
of
attorney's
fee
should
assist
in
vindicating
private
rights
of
action.
the
senate
committee
report
in
1974
indicated
that
there
was
private
right
of
action.
the
amendments
did
not
take
that
private
right
of
action
the
way
in
fact
by
having
attorney's
fees
and
by
additional
legislative
language,
by
the
senate
committee
comments,
from
senator
cranston,
the
floor
leader;
all
indicate
that
there
is
a
private
right
of
action.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
initially
in
the
senate
committee
report
in
1974.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
but
in
so
far
as
the
indication
of
congress
that
they
considered
that
a
private
right
of
action
was
necessary
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
handicapped
individuals
--
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
well
we
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
that
for
section
504
that
the
private
right
of
action
can
--
should
be
implied.
mr.
marc
p.
charmatz
no.
thank
you.
