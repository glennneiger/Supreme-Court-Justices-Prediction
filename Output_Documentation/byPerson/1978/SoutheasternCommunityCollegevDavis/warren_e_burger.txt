chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
711,
southeastern
community
college
against
davis.
mr.
gressman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
are
you
telling
us
that
the
hearing
aid
did
not
compensate
fully
or
substantially
for
the
handicap?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gressman,
you
spoke
of
the
nurse's
activities
in
terms
of
a
hospital.
there
are
some
nurses
who
function
in
private
homes
taking
care
of
patients
too,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
any
statute
giving
a
cause
of
action
against
an
individual
who
would
refuse
to
employ
a
nurse,
a
registered
nurse
on
the
grounds
that
the
registered
nurse
had
a
handicap
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
discriminatory
under
any
federal
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
an
individual,
i
was
addressing
my
question
to
an
individual
patient
in
a
private
home.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
restriction
or
is
it
just
--
does
it
violate
any
statute
civil
rights
or
otherwise
for
a
person
who
is
ill,
or
the
family
of
that
person
who
refused
to
hire
a
registered
nurse
on
the
ground
that
she's
hard
of
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
are
statutes
about
employments
that
do
not
involve
state
action,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
to
disqualify
a
person,
it
must
be
a
job
related
handicap
must
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
blind
person
might
be
--
would
be
obviously
disqualified
from
being
a
bus
driver
or
a
taxi
driver
but
not
necessarily
from
being
an
elevator
operator
perhaps.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
surely
a
person
who
is
blind
in
a
program
that
require
a
substantial
amount
of
reading
which
i
assume
most
academic
programs
do,
or
writing
--
and/or
writing,
or
listening.
a
person
who
is
deaf
would
hardly
be
qualified
in
the
absence
of
affirmative
special
assistance
to
that
person,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
this
statute
as
so
worded
as
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
under
this
simple
language
of
this
statute
as
been
found
in
a
requirement
for
expenditure
funds
for
a
special
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
those
regulations
have
been
promulgated
under
the
authority
of
this
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
not
leaving
yourself
much
time
for
the
implied
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
gressman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
that
was
a
late
filing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
may
respond.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
do
so
as
promptly
as
possible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
charmatz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
the
degree
of
impairment
of
this
other
300,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
it's
one
thing
to
perform,
even
a
deaf-mute
might
perform
in
the
laboratory
carrying
out
laboratory
tests
where
there's
no
contact
with
patients.
do
you
acknowledge
that
there
is
that
difference
and
availability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
before
we
turn
to
the
legislative
history,
we
must
be
confronted
with
the
statute
that's
ambiguous.
do
you
suggest
504
is
ambiguous
on
this
aspect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
clearly
worded?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
of
them
being
laboratory
technicians
for
which
she
could
qualify.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
this
program
entitled
to
make
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
adaptability
for
any
one
of
these
activities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
i
thought
you
conceded
she
was
not
adaptable
for
operating
room
performance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
members
of
congress
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
speaks
through
its
statutes
not
through
its
reports.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
