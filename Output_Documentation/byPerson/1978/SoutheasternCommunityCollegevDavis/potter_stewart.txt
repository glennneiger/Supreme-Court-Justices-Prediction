justice
potter
stewart
well
if
you're
receiving
a
federal
financial
assistance.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
that
504
is
talking
about
not
a
qualified
but
an
otherwise
qualified,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
one
could
read
is
as
saying
the
person
and
indeed
it's
a
natural
reading
that
a
person
who
is
qualified
except
for
his
handicap
shall
not
be
excluded
because
of
his
handicap.
and
that
but
i
gather
none
of
the
parties
here
suggest
that
it
should
be
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
the
blind
bus
driver
and
the
moronic
graduate
student
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
--
mr.
gressman
if
the
other
statute
does
give
a
cause
of
action,
you
don't
need
1983,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
do
we
know
what
her
physical
condition
was
when
she
originally
acquired
her
license
in
lpn?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
then
we
don't.
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
say
how
many
years.
many
years
can
be
five
or
six
or
12
or
20.
however,
go
on
proceed.
justice
potter
stewart
but
where
in
section
504
is
there
imposed
any
duty
to
make
any
modifications?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i'm
asking
about
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
no
such
requirement
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
unless
one
includes
in
technical
requirements
the
physical
requirements.
justice
potter
stewart
well
except
the
hew
regulations,
i
think
you
correct
me
if
i'm
mistaken,
define
technical
as
nonacademic,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
mean
--
that
would
include
physical
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it'd
be
helpful
if
--
i
know
you
think
it
can
be
construed
this,
that
way
or
the
other,
but
if
technical
means
everything
except
academic,
it
would
include
physical
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
despite
his
handicap,
his
or
her
handicap?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly
the
statute
doesn't
mean
that
he
could
do
it
except
for
his
handicap,
his
or
her
handicap.
it
couldn't
mean
that.
justice
potter
stewart
no?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
must
mean
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sorry?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
a
part
of
the
training
program
is
operating
room
procedures?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
concede
that
if
there
is
a
private
right
of
action,
as
you
contend
there
is,
it
is
an
implied
one
it's
not
an
explicit
one.
justice
potter
stewart
everybody
agrees
it's
not
explicitly
in
the
statute.
