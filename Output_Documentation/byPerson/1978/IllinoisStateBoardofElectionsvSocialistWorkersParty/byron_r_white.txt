justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
don't
you
at
least
agree
that
the
--
that
prior
summary
actions
are
not
entitled
to
the
same
way
here
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
one
sentence
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
lower
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
district
court
here
said
there
was
only
one
sentence
and
that
it
--
that
--
and
it
was
only
a
passing
mention,
wasn't
discussed,
etcetera.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
what
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
your
argument
here
limited
to
the
comparison
with
statewide
offices?
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
to
25,000
signature
limit
for
--
in
other
situations,
would
you
be
here
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
5%
requirement
on
its
face
or
in
the
context
of
illinois
politics
is
unreasonably
burdensome?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
being
--
but
not
generally.
justice
byron
r.
white
here
you
had
only
81
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
not
arguing
that
here
--
you're
not
supporting
the
judgment
on
that
ground
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
you
had
an
unlimited
amount
of
time
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
get
the
signatures
and
here
only
81
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
--
suppose
we
disagreed
--
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way,
did
the
court
of
appeals
relied
it
all
on
the
just
as
your
burdensome
in
el
salvador,
was
the
--
was
it
--
was
this
principal
ground
or
the
only
ground
the
comparison?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
if
we
disagreed
with
you?
wouldn't
--
to
be
consistent
with
storer
in
terms
of
burdensomeness,
shouldn't
it
be
remanded?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
wouldn't
decide
--
we
wouldn't
decide
that
issue
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
argue
it
was
burdensome.
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
but
to
that
issue,
i
would
suppose
it
should
be
decided
in
the
first
instance
in
the
lower
courts,
shouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
there's
a
permanent
injunctions
outstanding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
question
is
should
the
permanent
injunction
be
outstanding
for
a
reason
other
than
the
reason
given
in
the
lower
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
shouldn't
it
be
decided
there
first?
we
shouldn't
address
the
validity
of
the
5%
requirement
drawn
on,
should
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
do
you
suggest
that
that
issue
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
we
should
decide
it
if
we
were
to
reject
the
equal
protection
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
we
could
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
half
of
that
--
a
good
part
of
that
kind
of
a
judgment
is
some
feel
for
local
politics.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
party
has
seemed
to
have
been
unable
to
satisfy
it
on
prior
occasions.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
5%,
they've
been
able
to
--
its
not
--
hasn't
been
--
it
hasn't
prove
them
practical,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
justification
offered
by
the
state
for
a
greater
signature
requirement
in
cook
county
elections?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
understand
this
--
you
don't
under
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
don't
understand
the
state
ever
do
have
said
anymore
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact
the
record
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
--
you
think
you
just
have
to
go
about
it
in
by
percentages?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
state
has
and
it
said
25,000
is
enough
for
statewide.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
why
isn't
that
enough
in
cook
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
justification
do
you
have
for
the
distinction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
percentage.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
was
the
5%
requirement
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
1931
date
that
someone
mentioned?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
has
the
5%
been
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
been
--
what
would
have
been
--
how
many
signatures
would
the
5%
have
amounted
to
in
1931?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
have
been
less
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
than
25.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
your
position
in
jackson
v.
ogilvie?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
did
the
state
take
a
position?
