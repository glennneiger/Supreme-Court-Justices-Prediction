mr.
michael
l.
levinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
as
a
result
of
a
special
mayoral
election
held
in
the
city
of
chicago
on
june
7th,
1977.
the
plaintiffs
--
appellees
alleged
that
sections
10-2
and
10-3
of
chapter
46,
illinois
revised
statutes
unconstitutionally
deprived
them
of
their
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
in
this
case,
they
were
required
under
the
5%
minimum
signature
requirement
to
obtain
approximately
36,000
signatures
while
statewide
candidates
independent
new
political
party
candidates
running
for
state
office
need
only
25,000
signatures.
the
trial
court
below
issued
a
permanent
injunction
against
requiring
more
than
25,000
signatures
for
all
future
elections.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
opinion.
notwithstanding
the
objection
of
the
appellant
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
the
u.s.
labor
party
entered
into
a
private
agreement
with
the
chicago
board
of
elections
commissioners
to
further
lower
the
signature
requirements
from
25,000
to
20,000
and
to
extend
the
filing
period
from
64
days
before
the
election
to
50
days
before
the
election.
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
resolve
this
letter
issue
on
the
grounds
of
mootness.
appellant
submits
that
it
is
crucial
that
this
case
presents
a
serious
threat
to
the
viability
of
three
established
doctrines
of
this
court,
stare
decisis,
summary
affirmance
and
mootness.
with
respect
to
summary
--
i
am
sorry,
with
respect
to
stare
decisis,
appellant
submits
that
the
issues
involved
in
this
appeal,
namely
the
discrepancy
between
25,000
signatures
required
for
independents
and
new
political
party
candidates
running
statewide
and
the
5%
signature
requirement
for
all
other
offices
in
the
state
was
presented
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
jackson
v.
ogilvie,
it
was
presented
to
this
court
and
we
have
at
issue
the
same
statute
which
was
challenged
in
jackson
v.
ogilvie.
it
was
presented
to
this
court
and
we
have
at
issue
the
same
statute
which
was
challenged
in
jackson
v.
ogilvie.
we
have
the
same
defendant
which
was
sued
in
jackson
v.
ogilvie.
we
have
the
same
office
being
sought
which
is
mayor
and
in
the
essence,
we
argue
that
the
same
statute
is
again
being
relitigated.
we
argue
in
our
briefs
that
the
principle
stare
decisis
and
the
interest
of
uniformity
and
predictability
should
have
guided
the
lower
courts
into
affirming
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
we
also
suggest
that
the
law
of
the
case
although
not
on
all
fours
necessarily
with
this
case
should
be
expanded
to
include
a
situation
where
an
identical
statute
is
being
challenged
and
in
effect
we
maintain
the
same
script
as
being
presented.
the
actors
are
different
but
the
roles
are
the
same.
we
have
an
independent
candidate
running
for
mayor
in
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
no,
sir.
i
do
not
construe
that.
i
have
--
in
this
court,
i've
construed
that
summary
affirmances
have
precedential
value
and
that
the
state
of
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
understand
or
as
appellant
is
maintaining
that
perhaps
the
ratio
decidendi
or
the
rule
of
law
which
is
to
be
gleaned
from
a
summary
affirmance
is
very
difficult
in
the
absence
of
an
opinion.
but
as
justice
white
stated
in
hicks
versus
miranda,
“votes
to
affirm
summarily
and
to
dismiss
for
one
of
a
substantial
federal
question,
it
hardly
needs
comments
or
votes
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
lower
courts
are
bound
by
summary
decisions
by
this
court
until
such
time
as
the
court
informs
them
that
they
are
not.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
in
terms
of
this
court
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
sir.
i
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
hopefully
not.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
you
can.
of
course
you
can.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
but
that
would
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
you
would
have
to
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes
in
this
court,
it
does.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
that's
true.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
for
the
appellees
to
succeed
in
this
case,
appellants
submit
would
require
overturning
the
jackson
summary
affirmance.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
mr.
chief
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
read
hicks
versus
miranda
and
the
mandel
decision
that
there
is
less
constraint
on
this
honorable
court
than
to
decide
otherwise
than
were
the
case
to
receive
plenary
consideration.
but
notwithstanding
that
point,
you
had
quoted
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
i'd
like
to
read
from
the
quote
in
torres
versus
new
york
state
department
of
labor,
“when
we
summarily
affirm
without
opinion,
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
not
necessarily
the
reasoning
by
which
it
was
reached”.
therefore,
what
appellees
are
suggesting
in
this
case
is
that
the
summary
affirmance
was
nothing
more
than
an
adoption
of
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
in
jackson
v.
ogilvie
and
what
appellants
are
urging
on
this
court,
is
that
the
same
issue
which
is
being
raised
in
this
litigation
was
raised
in
jackson
v.
ogilvie.
it
was
part
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
its
part
of
the
appendix
to
the
u.s.
labor
party's
brief,
therefore,
we
could
only
assume
that
this
court
considered
it
when
it
summarily
affirmed
the
jackson
v.
ogilvie.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes
it
was,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
as
i
recall
your
honor,
in
our
briefs
we
do
maintain
that
the
issue
was
presented
to
this
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
i
see.
well,
i
believe
we
cite
it
in
the
briefs
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
no,
it's
more
than
one
sentence.
although,
the
lower
court
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
that
with
all
due
respect
to
the
lower
court
i
think
that
is
not
a
totally
accurate
statement
because
in
the
later
opinion
of
the
court
he
says,
well
it
was
mentioned
in
passing
in
a
brief
but
attached
is
appendix
d
to
the
u.s.
labor
party's
brief
is
the
memorandum
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
this
court
will
note
that
it's
more
just
one
sentence.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
it's
a
significant
argument.
it
was
made
both
in
the
lower
court
and
we
suggest
in
this
honorable
court
by
virtue
of
the
jurisdictional
question.
now
even
were
this
court
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
but
this
was
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
well,
this
court
did
not
grant
plenary
consideration
therefore
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
contained
the
memorandum
of
the
attorney
general
was
an
issue
presented
based
on
the
doctrines
of
this
court
in
hicks
and
mandel
if
it's
an
issue
which
has
been
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
the
lower
courts
are
bound
by
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
the
appellants
jackson
attached
the
memorandum
of
the
attorney
general
to
his
jurisdictional
statement
because
the
attorney
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
there
was
no
oral
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
well,
by
attaching
it
to
the
jurisdictional
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
well,
cause
no
plenary
consideration
was
given.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
since
no
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
--
plenary
consideration
was
given,
the
only
way
it
could
be
presented
to
the
court,
we
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
well,
there
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
there
was
a
crossover.
it
is
stated
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
we
--
or
attaching
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
and
it's
incorporated
within
the
jurisdictional
statement.
he
attaches
it
as
appendix
b
to
the
jackson
v.
ogilvie
jurisdictional
statement.
this
is
for
the
reason
stated
therein.
we
are
including
that
as
apart
of
our
argument
so
he
is
incorporating
by
reference
the
position
of
the
attorney
general,
i.e.
that
the
discrepancy
between
statewide
candidates
and
less
than
statewide
candidates
invidiously
discriminates
them
in
violation
of
equal
protection.
it's
very
clear
from
the
jurisdictional
statement
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
we
did
mention,
as
i
recall
in
our
brief
your
honor.
even
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
jackson
and
jenness
decisions
were
not
controlling,
we
further
urge
that
this
court
should
find
for
appellants
on
the
grounds
of
the
5%
signature
requirements
satisfied
the
compelling
state
interest.
the
jenness
v.
fortson
case
appellant
submits
is
a
watershed
case
where
this
court
upheld
as
satisfying
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
signature
requirement
of
the
5%
of
the
registered
voters.
whereas
in
illinois,
it
is
5%
not
of
the
registered
voters
but
actually
the
voters
who
voted
at
the
last
general
election,
and
normally
voter
turn
out
as
a
50%.
storer
v.
brown
sustained
a
5%
signature
requirement.
there
is
in
the
interest
of
doctrinal
continuity
that
this
5%
requirement
which
this
court
has
sustained
be
maintained.
in
fact,
appellees
are
suggesting
it
chipping
away
of
the
5%
and
they
rely
on
lendall
v.
jernigan
and
appellant
suggests
that
they
are
overstating
their
case.
in
the
lendall
v.
jernigan
case,
the
state
of
arkansas
failed
to
satisfy
according
to
this
court
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
it
was
a
10%
requirement.
the
court
did
note
that
in
the
city
of
littlerock,
50
signatures
were
required
whereas
in
a
larger
state
senatorial
district,
more
signatures
were
required.
but
that
was
not
the
reason
that
the
court,
this
court
we
suggest,
struck
down
landell
v.
jernigan.
the
reason
it
was
struck
down
is
that
10%
was
too
high.
illinois
has
5%
which
is
not
too
high
and
most
important,
the
district
court
took
25,000
signatures
and
superimposed
that
as
a
maximum
on
the
5%
signature
requirement.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
authority
whatsoever
for
this.
this
court
in
landell
v.
jernigan
did
not
take
the
50
signature
maximum
for
the
city
of
littlerock,
arkansas
and
say
that
was
the
most
signatures
that
can
be
required.
you
merely
struck
down
the
10%
signature
requirement.
if
i
may
now
address
myself
to
the
question
of
mootness,
the
resolution
of
the
question
of
the
authority
of
an
election
agency
to
lower
signature
requirements
and
extend
filing
periods
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.
we
maintain
that
a
resolution
of
this
question
will
determine
the
rights
of
the
litigants
particularly
the
chicago
board
of
election
commissioners.
they
maintain
that
they
have
the
right
in
special
elections
to
deviate
from
the
statute
to
lower
these
statutory
signature
requirements,
to
extend
filing
dates,
this
brings
in
a
personal
factor
but
the
statute
was
universalistic
and
fair
to
everyone,
they
entered
into
a
private
agreement
and
we
feel
that
even
though
the
election
is
over,
based
on
this
court's
decisions
in
american
party
of
texas
versus
white,
storer
v.
brown,
moore
versus
ogilvie,
that
this
issue
was
still
viable
and
that
a
--
and
that
this
issue
should
be
resolved.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
we
are
arguing
that
the
doctrine
of
mootness
has
been
given
lip
service
by
the
lower
courts
but
that
the
issue
was
not
moot
and
that
it
should
be
remanded.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
that's
right.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
we
do.
we
disagree
with
that
portion
of
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
which
held
that
the
issue
to
--
the
issue
of
lowering
signature
requirements
in
favor
of
one
political
party
and
not
in
favor
of
another,
the
u.s.
libertarian
party
sought
to
intervene
and
obtained
ballot
access
with
18,000
signatures
and
the
courts
said
"no".
and
the
chicago
board
didn't
agree
to
18,000
but
they
agreed
to
20
for
the
u.s.
labor
party.
we
felt
that
was
an
issue
which
was
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review
and
that
the
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
this
did
not
resolve
the
issue
on
the
ground
of
mootness.
they
declined
to
resolve
that
issue.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
death,
disqualification,
removal
from
office,
any
number
of
contingencies
might
cause
another
special
election
and
i
don't
think
any
of
us
can
foresee
the
future.
i
think
it's
a
viable
potentiality
that
may
occur
in
the
future
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
necessarily
know
the
motivations
of
the
chicago
board
of
election
commissioners
and
we
feel
that
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
right
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
time
for
rebuttal
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
the
5%
signature
requirement,
it's
not
solely
directed
at
cook
county.
it
is
applicable
at
all
102
counties
in
the
state
in
excess
of
1200
municipalities,
8000
townships.
so
it's
not
solely
directed
to
the
city
of
chicago
or
the
county
of
cook.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
if
--
i
suggest
that
some
historical
staging
is
necessary
in
terms
of
a
justification.
the
approach
taken
by
the
general
assembly
with
regard
to
statewide
candidates
was
somewhat
different
with
regard
to
any
and
all
other
candidates,
local,
township,
county
and
so
forth.
it
was
both
based
on
geographic
considerations
as
well
as
signatures.
there
was
a
requirement
of
200
voters
from
at
least
50
counties
plus
25,000
signatures.
this
court
in
moore
versus
ogilvie
on
the
basis
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
struck
down
the
200
voters
requirement.
statute
was
amended
and
it
provided
that
not
more
than
13,000
signatures
may
come
from
any
one
county
to
be
counted
towards
the
25,000
signatures.
in
the
case
of
communist
party
of
illinois
versus
state
board
of
elections,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
again
on
the
basis
of
one
man,
one
vote
struck
down
the
13,000
signature
requirement.
therefore
the
25,000
signatures
is
just
a
vestigial
remnant
of
a
plan
which
was
based
on
geographic
plus
signature
requirements,
a
totally
different
scheme
than
the
5%
which
was
uniform,
applicable
to
all
municipalities,
townships
and
counties.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
well,
i
believe
justice
--
mr.
justice
--
oh,
i
better
not
guess.
there
was
one
justice
who
dissented
in
moore
versus
ogilvie
claiming
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
a
geographic
distribution
and
there
was
conflict
of
constitutional
principles.
that
was
one
of
the
justices
of
this
court.
we
are
only
suggesting
that
the
appellees
are
urging
in
this
court
that
a
new
classification
be
created,
that
in
populous
areas,
less
than
5%
signatures
be
required
but
in
rural
areas,
5%
be
required.
so
they
are
in
fact
urging
a
new
classification
if
in
fact
25,000
become
superimposed
as
a
sealing
because
then
you
only
need
two
or
3%.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
i
think
if
the
general
assembly
had
struck
25,000
and
made
5%
the
minimum
signature
requirement
for
statewide
candidates,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
based
jenness,
based
on
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
that's
right.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
because
in
all
other
areas
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
i
have
no
justification
other
than
there
were
two
different
legislative
schemes.
one
based
on
geographic
support
and
signature
requirement
and
for
all
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
and
a
percentage.
well,
no
percentage
statewide.
for
all
other
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
--
units
to
local
government,
and
townships
and
counties,
it
was
5%.
two
separate
schemes
to
court
action,
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
has
eroded
away
the
bulk
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
it's
been
there
a
number
of
years.
it's
been
a
number
of
years,
i
think.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
that
was
the
25,000
signature
requirement.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
almost
as
long,
yes
sir?
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
i
don't
have
those
figures.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
it
might
have
been.
yes,
sir.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
they
could've
changed
and
they
could've
increased
it.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
that's
true.
i
have
only
one
short
point
to
add.
with
regard
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
signature
requirements
in
jackson
v.
ogilvie
were
60,000.
in
this
instant
case,
there
were
36,000.
there
was
a
restriction
on
signers
of
petitions
of
independent
and
new
political
parties
that
they
must
not
have
voted
in
the
previous
primary.
section
10-4
of
the
election
code
was
amended
and
there
was
no
longer
a
restriction.
the
facts
are
much
more
favorable
to
the
state
in
the
context
of
this
case
than
jackson
v.
ogilvie.
and
as
a
con
--
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
we
were
not
created.
there
was
no
state
board
of
elections.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes.
they
argued
against
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
and
this
court
did
not
accept
that
argument.
there
was
no
fact
finding
done
by
the
lower
court.
we
were
denied
a
hearing
in
violation
of
rule
65.
questions
have
been
propounded
by
this
honorable
court
as
what
has
been
the
history.
how
may
candidates
have
been
allowed
on?
a
new
political
party
candidates
and
independents
in
certain
statements
had
been
made.
i
would
ask
that
this
court
treat
those
statements
with
caution.
they
are
outside
the
record
and
what
we
requested,
never
received
was
a
hearing
wherein
the
plaintiffs
would
have
been
required
to
put
on
a
case
to
show
that
they
couldn't
have
met
the
signature
requirements
and
what
the
history
was
and
to
our
knowledge,
a
minor
political
parties
have
gained
access
to
the
chicago
ballot
as
well
as
independent
candidates
in
the
past.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
exactly.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
right.
the
burden
was
shifted
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
state
board
approved
its
case
when
the
plaintiffs
never
had
approved
their
case
whatsoever
in
terms
of
showing
any
restrictions,
in
terms
of
the
time
period.
the
environment
had
significantly
changed
since
jackson
v.
ogilvie
and
we
believe
in
favor
of
the
appellees.
and
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court,
i'd
like
to
thank
you.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes,
i
wanted
to
use
your
dissent.
okay,
you
felt
that
there
was
a
rational
distinction.
mr.
michael
l.
levinson
yes.
thank
you
sir.
