mr.
ronald
reosti
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
my
contention
that
there
is
a
basis
for
determining
that
the
5%
requirement
in
cook
county
and
in
chicago
in
the
context
of
illinois
politics
and
in
the
context
of
the
history
of
the
illinois
election
law
is
too
burdensome.
mr.
ronald
reosti
no.
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
reosti
i'm
saying
if
this
court
decides
to
reject
the
equal
protection
argument
that
it
can
be
decided
on
its
face.
mr.
ronald
reosti
and
sure
with
this
case.
mr.
ronald
reosti
i
think
your
honor
that
the
20th
--
the
history
of
the
application
of
the
25,000
signature
requirement
on
a
statewide
basis
provides
this
court
with
ample
basis
for
determining
that
given
the
effectiveness
of
the
25,000
signature
requirement
that
the
additional
burden
in
light
of
the
significance
of
that
burden
would
be
clearly
unnecessary.
mr.
ronald
reosti
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
reosti
your
honor,
in
cook
county
it
has
proved
the
impossible.
in
other
words,
no
candidate
according
to
the
record
in
this
case,
no
candidate
whether
a
third
party
or
an
independent
has
ever
qualified
for
office
in
cook
county
by
meeting
the
5%
requirement.
furthermore,
only
one
candidate
in
the
history
of
the
law
since
1931
prior
to
the
decision
below,
only
one
candidate
has
ever
qualified
for
office
in
chicago
by
meeting
this
requirement.
so
that
if
you
take
all
of
the
elections
for
cook
county
and
chicago
together,
only
once
has
anyone
ever
met
that
qualification.
so
it
is
a
substantial
burden.
when
we
look
at
the
burden
in
terms
of
cook
county
alone,
the
additional
signatures
required,
just
the
increment
alone
would
equal
4%
of
the
total
electorate.
now
4%
as
we
know
is
very
close
to
the
maximum
amount
of
signatures
that
this
court
has
ever
said
is
permissible
on
the
part
of
the
state.
so
it's
very
close
to
the
very
maximum
burden
that
this
court
has
allowed
the
state
to
impose
on
these
very
fundamental
rights.
and
yet
this
is
just
the
increment
alone.
if
we're
going
to
look
at
the
increment,
we
must
look
at
the
need
for
the
increment.
that
need
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
fashioned
a
less
drastic
alternative
for
protecting
its
interest
which
at
least
on
a
statewide
level
has
served
those
interests
very
well
since
1931.
there
are
certainly
methods
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
application
was
25,000
maximum
for
a
much
larger
population
as
resulted
in
bedsheet
ballots
as
resulted
in
the
inclusion
of
frivolous
candidates
on
a
statewide
level.
mr.
ronald
reosti
there
is
no
reason
for
--
mr.
ronald
reosti
none
whatsoever.
they
indicate
that
the
only
requirement
for
the
5%
in
cook
county
is
to
test
the
fact
that
the
candidate
has
a
modicum
--
they
put
it
as
some
community
support.
i
assume
that
they
mean
a
significant
modicum
of
community
support.
certainly,
if
a
candidate
on
a
statewide
level
with
25,000
supporters
has
a
significant
modicum
of
support,
the
interest
must
be
the
same
then
a
candidate
in
cook
county
or
chicago
with
25,000
supporters
must
in
the
terms
of
illinois'
--
mr.
ronald
reosti
--
history.
mr.
ronald
reosti
they
--
i
do
not
understand
them
to
have
ever
said
any
more
than
that.
mr.
ronald
reosti
he
may
need
a
lot
bigger
base
of
support
to
win
but
it
doesn't
need
a
bigger
base
of
support
to
become
a
legitimate
candidate.
a
legitimate
candidate
is
a
legitimate
candidate
in
the
context
of
illinois.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
jenness
is
that
the
court
did
not
have
before
it
a
state
fashioned
alternative
as
it
does
here.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
illinois
and
it
says,
this
is
the
test
that
we're
going
to
apply
on
a
statewide
basis
to
determine,
who's
a
serious
not
frivolous
candidate?
mr.
ronald
reosti
well,
--
mr.
ronald
reosti
i
don't
think
so
because
it
is
cynical.
and
i
think
basically
that
when
a
state
puts
forth
the
reason
for
burdening
the
very
important
fundamental
rights
which
are
at
issue
that
that
interest
than
they
puts
forth
has
to
be
as
--
has
to
not
be
cynical,
has
to
be
as
real
and
concrete
and
related
to
its
legitimate
interest
as
the
burden
that
it's
putting
on
those
rights.
mr.
ronald
reosti
well,
i
don't
see
any
relationship
between
any
of
the
interest
that
this
court
has
indicated,
our
legitimate
state
interest
which
justified
burdening
the
fundamental
rights
at
issue
here.
and
the
interest
of
ensuring
that
someone
is
going
to
get
on
the
ballot
that
they're
going
to
win
which
i
take
it
is
the
essence
of
that
argument.
mr.
ronald
reosti
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
gone
that
far.
mr.
ronald
reosti
it's
read
this
way
since
1931.
by
the
way,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
state
has
twice
in
recent
years
had
a
chance
to
amend
the
statute
and
do
something
about
the
25,000
signature
requirement.
in
each
of
the
case,
--
mr.
ronald
reosti
--
they've
kept
it,
they've
kept
the
25,000.
mr.
ronald
reosti
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
reosti
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
reosti
yes,
sir.
well,
if
there
aren't
any
questions,
thank
you.
