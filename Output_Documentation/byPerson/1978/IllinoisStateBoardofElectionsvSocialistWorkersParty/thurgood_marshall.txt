now
my

that

all

the

they

justice

in
the
derrick
case,
the
illinois
state
board
of
elections
against
the
socialist
workers
party
did
appear
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
under
the
illinois
election
code,
new
political
parties
and
independent
candidates
must
obtain
a
signature
of
25,000
qualified
voters
in
order
to
appear
on
the
ballot
in
statewide
elections.
however,
a
different
standard
applies
in
elections
for
offices
of
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
the
minimum
number
of
citizens
required
there
is
5%
of
the
number
of
persons
who
voted
at
the
previous
election
for
officers
of
the
particular
subdivision.
application
is
standard
to
a
special
mayoral
election
in
the
city
of
chicago
produced
the
anomalous
result
that
a
new
party
or
independent
candidate
needed
substantially
more
signatures
to
gain
access
to
the
ballot,
that
would
be
needed
for
a
ballot
access
in
a
statewide
election.
appellees,
a
new
political
party
and
an
independent
candidate
for
mayor
of
chicago
brought
this
action
charging
the
discrepancy
between
the
signature
requirements.
the
district
court
enjoined
enforcement
of
the
5%
provision
insofar
as
it
mandated
more
than
25,000
signatures
in
city
elections
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
by
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
restrictions
on
access
to
the
ballot
must
share
a
compelling
state
interest.
while
states
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
screening
out
frivolous
candidates,
illinois
had
determined
that
the
25,000
signature
requirement
is
sufficient
to
accomplish
this
result
in
a
statewide
election.
department
of
the
state
board
of
elections
has
advanced
no
reason
much
less
a
compelling
one
why
most
signatures
are
necessary
for
elections
in
the
city
of
chicago
which
is
a
small
political
unit.
accordingly,
we
find
these
access
restrictions
cannot
withstand
scrutiny
under
the
limitation
clause
and
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
chief
justice
concurs

blackmun

justices
rehnquist
and
stevens
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
