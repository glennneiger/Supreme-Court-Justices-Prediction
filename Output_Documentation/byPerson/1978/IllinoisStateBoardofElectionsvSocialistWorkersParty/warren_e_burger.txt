we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
illinois
state
board
of
elections
against
the
socialist
workers
party.
mr.
levinson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
based
not
just
on
the
fact
that
it
is
not
a
fully
developed
opinion
necessarily
but
this
case
that
hasn't
had
plenary
treatment
was
full
briefing
in
oral
argument
in
this
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
therefore
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
well,
we
can
ignore
theoretically
any
opinion
of
the
court,
we
give
less
weight
to
the
summary,
dispositions,
isn't
that
the
way
you
read
hicks
against
miranda?
we're
free
to
give
less
weight
to
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
colman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
unless
it's
a
five
to
four
decision
per
curiam
opinions
don't
carry
any
weights.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
reosti.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
levinson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you're
telling
us
that
no
hardship
was
shown
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
basis
for
any
conclusion
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
