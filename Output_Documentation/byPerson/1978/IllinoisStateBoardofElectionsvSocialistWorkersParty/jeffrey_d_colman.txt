mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
begin
by
trying
to
answer
the
question
that
justice
stevens
was
concerned
about
in
appendix
c
to
the
brief
of
appellees
gerald
rose,
u.s.
labor
party
at
page
19
(a)
in
the
appendix
on
the
pages
listed
at
the
top,
this
is
the
jurisdictional
statement
filed
in
jackson
versus
ogilvie
by
the
appellants.
in
this
jurisdictional
statement
as
mr.
levinson
indicated,
reference
is
made
to
the
memorandum
of
law
filed
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
district
court
but
if
the
court
will
review
page
19
(a),
you'll
see
the
context
in
which
the
reference
is
made
to
the
attorney
general's
memorandum.
the
appellants
in
jackson
versus
ogilvie
raised
two
questions
in
this
court.
first,
the
question
whether
the
5%
requirement
for
independent
and
new
party
candidates
discriminated
against
those
people
vis-Ã -vis
established
political
parties,
democrats
and
republicans.
second,
they
questioned
whether
the
5%
requirement
applied
to
independents
and
new
political
parties
in
illinois
was
more
onerous
than
in
other
states
and
it's
in
that
context
that
the
appellants
in
jackson
versus
ogilvie
said
for
a
most
persuasive
answer
to
the
foregoing
inquiry,
it
is
respectfully
suggested.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
oh,
about
a
third
of
the
way
down.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
two-fifths
the
way
down.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
it
is
most
respectfully
suggested
that
this
court
might
properly
look
to
and
reasonably
rely
upon
the
response
and
pleadings
and
memorandum
of
law
filed
by
the
attorney
general.
that
was
the
context
of
the
reference
in
jackson
versus
ogilvie
to
the
defendant's
memorandum
filed
in
the
district
court.
we
submit
and
we
believe
that
the
opinions
of
this
court
support
this
proposition
that
it
would
cause
chaos
if
district
courts
and
state
courts
are
forced
to
look
to
the
record
filed
in
this
court
in
order
to
determine
whether
a
summary
affirmance
is
binding
on
them.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
spoken
very
persuasively
to
this
matter
on
numerous
occasions.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
been
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
mandel
versus
bradley
and
in
mandel
versus
bradley
the
majority
per
curiam
opinion
supports
that
position
as
well.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
we
would
submit
also
that
in
hicks
versus
miranda,
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
white
in
which
he
indicates
that
those
issues
properly
presented
to
this
court
are
the
issues
that
are
binding
on
lower
courts
insofar
as
summary
affirmances
are
concerned.
it's
hard
for
anyone
to
conceive
that
the
segment
on
page
19
(a)
in
our
brief
that
which
was
filed
in
the
jurisdictional
statements
in
jackson
versus
ogilvie
properly
presents
to
this
court
the
question
that
is
before
you
today.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
which
is
whether
sections
10-2
and
10-3
of
the
illinois
election
code
which
require
local
candidates
in
chicago
and
cook
county
who
are
independents
or
new
political
parties
to
obtain
far
in
excess
of
25,000
signatures
to
obtain
ballot
placement
as
opposed
to
a
maximum
25,000
signature
requirement
for
all
other
elections
in
state
of
illinois.
if
i
may
by
hypothetical
give
you
what
is
the
reality
in
illinois.
if
i
want
to
field
an
independent
candidate
for
president
of
the
united
states,
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
illinois,
governor
of
the
state
of
illinois
or
any
other
office
outside
of
chicago,
i
can
satisfy
the
state's
needs
by
obtaining
25,000
signatures.
it's
only
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
the
reality
--
yes,
your
honor.
the
reality
is
that
25,000
people
can
bind
together
in
cook
county
or
in
the
city
of
chicago
and
field
an
entire
slate
of
candidates
for
statewide
office,
for
president
of
the
united
states,
for
any
office
except
those
offices
in
chicago
where
the
5%
requirement
would
require
them
to
get
more
than
25,000
signatures.
this
is
the
absolutely
irrational
classification
that
is
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
the
second
most
populous
county
in
the
state
is
the
dupage
county
and
the
5%
requirement
in
dupage
county
would
require
12,000
signatures.
the
second
most
populous
city
in
the
state
of
illinois
is
rockford
and
the
5%
requirement
there
requires
1500
signatures.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
in
rockford
city.
the
second
most
populous
county
is
dupage
county.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
excuse
me?
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
according
to
the
1970
census,
your
honor
which
is
the
official
census
by
which
they
go
in
1970
rockford
had
31,000
votes
cast
for
mayor
and
that
was
the
second
highest
vote
at
that
time.
i'm
sorry
that
was
in
the
1977
election
but
the
population
was
the
second
highest.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
i
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
actually,
it's
not
a
precise
statement
of
the
argument
we're
making.
in
that
memorandum
on
page
23
(a),
the
attorney
general
is
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
requirements
for
independents
in
the
city
of
chicago
and
for
new
political
parties
statewide.
actually
that
was
a
complete
misstatement
of
what
sections
10-2
and
10-3
require.
the
proper
articulation
of
the
argument
is
that
both
independents
and
new
political
parties
running
in
the
city
of
chicago
are
required
to
obtain
more
than
25,000
signatures
and
both
independents
and
new
political
parties
running
statewide
need
obtain
no
more
than
25,000
signatures.
so
if
we're
looking
at
page
23
(a),
it
does
not
even
literally
or
specifically
state
the
argument
that's
before
this
court.
it
misstates
the
law.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
it
alludes
to
it
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
it's
my
understanding
that
it
was.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
i
stated
earlier
that
in
our
view
and
as
well
in
the
view
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
classification
which
requires
independents
and
new
political
parties
in
chicago
and
cook
county
to
obtain
more
than
25,000
signatures
is
irrational.
we
of
course
maintain
and
the
state
board
has
never
questioned
us
on
this
that
rationality
is
not
the
test
to
be
applied
by
this
court.
fundamental
rights
are
at
stake
in
this
case.
the
court
has
long
acknowledged
that
the
fundamental
right
to
vote
and
the
freedom
of
association
contained
within
the
first
amendment
support
a
compelling
state
interest
test
whenever
the
state
attempts
to
classify
and
legislate
in
an
area
that
would
deprive
people
of
access
to
the
ballot.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
we
thought
that
it
was
within
the
context
of
the
special
mayoral
election
held
last
year.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
generally
this
court
has
upheld
that.
and
while
i
disagree
with
the
opinion
in
jenness
versus
fortson
i
acknowledge
that
i
would
not
be
here.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
not
crucial
to
the
court.
we
would
certainly
assert
it
as
an
independent
grounds
for
affirmance
and
we
do
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that
was
decided
in
jackson
versus
ogilvie
your
honor
within
the
context
of
a
general
election.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
and
if
i
may
just
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
if
i
want
to
run
for
mayor
of
the
city
of
chicago
in
1999
i
can
go
out
and
start
collecting
my
signatures
tomorrow.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
no,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
state
itself
has
determined
that
25,000
satisfy
the
state's
interest
in
making
sure
that
candidates
for
statewide
office
and
for
president
of
the
united
states
have
of
a
sufficient
modicum
of
support.
and
if
i
may
choose
again
allude
to
something
that
mr.
justice
white
said
in
cases
that
followed
dunn
versus
blumstein,
this
court
has
upheld
a
50-day
durational
residency
requirement.
we
would
submit
that
if
illinois
for
example
had
a
50-day
durational
residency
requirement
which
was
upheld
by
this
court,
but
then
amended
its
statute
to
say
that
it
would
be
30
days
for
statewide
offices
or
30
for
local
offices
whichever
would
be
the
state
would
have
an
obligation
to
justify
the
discriminatory
treatment.
it
may
be
able
to
satisfy
that
obligation
in
certain
cases.
in
this
case
however,
it
has
only
stated
that
they
need
a
sufficient
modicum
of
support
and
25,000
signatures
satisfies
that
requirement.
now,
with
regard
to
the
mootness
claim,
we
believe
that
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
the
case
before
the
court
today
is
different
from
all
of
the
other
mootness
cases
that
had
come
before
this
court
in
the
election
context.
those
cases
all
involved
continuing
statutory
enactments
where
the
statute
itself
would
have
effect
in
an
election
year
and
after
that
year
after
year
after
year.
the
mootness
question
here
is
whether
the
state
board
of
elections
and
the
city
board
of
elections
have
overlapping
powers
whether
the
city
board
of
elections
properly
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
that
specifically
applied
only
to
the
special
mayoral
election
back
in
1977.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
little
likelihood
of
any
recurring
problem
in
this
area
and
therefore
dismissed
the
appeal
on
that
question
as
moot.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
the
equal
protection
analysis
that
the
district
court
engaged
in
and
that
was
limited
essentially
to
the
disparity
between
25,000
statewide
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
we
would
agree
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
well,
we
would
agree
that
it
was
burdensome
given
the
factual
context,
the
limited
number
of
time.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
i'm
sorry.
yes,
we
would
argue
that.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that
was
the
issue
that
we
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
on
your
honor.
the
way
this
whole
thing
came
about
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
correct
and
the
permanent
injunction
says
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
it
should
not
if
this
court
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
the
--
no,
you
should
not.
and
the
only
basis
for
the
permanent
injunction
was
the
district
court's
finding
that
a
requirement
that
you
obtain
more
than
25,000
signatures
did
not
meet
the
state's
necessary
obligation.
its
obligation
show
what
it
--
what
was
required
to
meet
the
constitutionally
permissible
standards.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
in
this
case
your
honor
the
only
thing
that
was
found
to
be
moot
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
settlement
agreement.
not
the
--
there's
a
permanent
injunction
as
mr.
justice
white
notes
that
is
in
effect
and
is
in
operation
in
tomorrow's
election
in
illinois
and
in
next
year's
election
and
that
was
based
on
the
equal
protection
analysis.
your
honor
is
correct
in
terms
of
what
the
law
would
be
if
the
entire
case
was
found
to
be
moot.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
because
the
election
had
passed
because
this
as
an
agreement
entered
--
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
d.
colman
it
could
have
remanded
with
instructions
to
dissolve
settlement
agreement,
the
order
entered
in
march
17th
but
that
order
itself
says
that
it
applies
only
to
the
june
1977
election.
it
is
of
absolutely
no
precedential
value
by
its
own
terms.
i
--
your
honor
is
correct,
that
would
be
the
normal
process
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
order
itself
died
in
june
of
1977.
so
there
was
no
necessity
for
doing
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
