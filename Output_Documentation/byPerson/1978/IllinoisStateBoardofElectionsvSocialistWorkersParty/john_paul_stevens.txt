justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levinson,
would
you
help
me
on
that
precise
point.
you
have
said
that
the
same
issue
was
raised
which
i
take
it
means
that
in
the
jackson
case,
there
was
an
argument,
not
only
that
the
5%
was
unreasonable
but
the
fact
that
5%
in
the
city
of
chicago
produced
a
higher
number
than
the
25%
--
25,000
in
other
parts
of
the
state,
was
that
precise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't
quote
that
part
in
your
brief.
you
didn't
--
you
just
"language"
that
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
5%
goes
to
58,000.
you
don't
quote
anything
that
refers
to
discrepancy
between
58,000
and
25,000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
but
you
don't
cite
anything
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
supports
your
statement,
that's
what
puzzled
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
part
of
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levinson,
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
it's
really
quite
important
that
i
do
know
exactly
what
you're
relying
on.
you
relying
on
appendix
d
to
the
labor
department's
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
an
argument
made
in
the
united
states
district
court,
is
that
as
i
understand
it
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
anything
--
what
was
argued
in
this
court
and
that
it
was
the
same
argument
that
was
being
made
here
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
commence
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
argument
in
this
court
that
your
opponents
now
rely
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
advanced
the
argument
in
this
court
in
jackson
against
ogilvie
that
your
opponents
now
rely
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
he
make
the
argument
other
than
attaching
a
document
that
shows
it
was
argued
in
the
district
court?
did
he
make
the
argument
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
in
this
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
--
that's
the
extent
of
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
other
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
but
--
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
the
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
argument
could
have
been
advanced
in
jurisdictional
statement
itself
and
said
we
think
the
decision
is
wrong
for
this
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
was
not
done,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don't
understand
if
that's
clear
why
you
didn't
quote
any
of
these
in
your
brief.
i'll
look
at
this
jurisdictional
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
rockford
bigger
than
peoria?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
rockford
bigger
than
peoria?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
go
back
once
more
if
i
may
to
pages
19
(a)
and
appendix
d.
you
pointed
out
that
19
(a)
doesn't
articulate
the
argument
that's
being
debated
right
now.
i
notice
however
on
the
last
sentence
of
paragraph
two
on
page
23
(a)
does
precisely
identify
the
argument
that
you're
making.
now,
it
could
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
state
this
--
a
similar
argument
then
they
break
of
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
was
--
where
did
it
--
it
was
--
appendix
d
actually
an
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reosti.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reosti,
if
i
may
ask
a
background
question,
when
did
this
discrepancy
in
the
statute
arise?
how
long
was
this
statute
read
this
way,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
you
should
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
also
rather
interesting
that
now
i'm
seeing
this
appendix
d
again,
the
governor
of
illinois
and
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
took
the
position
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
brother
remarked
of.
