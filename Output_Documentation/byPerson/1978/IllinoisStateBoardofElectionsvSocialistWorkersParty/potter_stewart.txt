justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
can't.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
we're
quibbling
about
words.
we
--
we
probably
can't
ignore
it.
we
have
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
mention
it
but
it
has
as
my
brother
brennan
suggests,
less
precedential
controlling
weight
here
in
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
than
a
fully
developed
court
opinion
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
the
case
would
have.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
mr.
levinson,
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
we
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
was
in
error
in
considering
this
second
issue
moot
then
we
should
do
no
more
than
on
that
branch
of
the
case
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
decision
of
the
merits,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
we
shouldn't
attempt
to
decide
the
merits
here.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
not
reading
from
19
(a)?
justice
potter
stewart
about
where
on
the
page?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
that's
been
in
dissent
primarily,
hasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
that
is
what
you
concede
was
decided
in
jackson
against
ogilvie.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
simply
an
attack
on
the
5%
requirement
as
such.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
expect
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally,
i
was
a
dissenter
in
moore
against
ogilvie,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
harlan
was
showing
me
