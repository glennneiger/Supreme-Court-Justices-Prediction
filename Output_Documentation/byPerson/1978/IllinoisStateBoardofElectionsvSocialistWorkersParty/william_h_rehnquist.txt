justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
case
you
were
referring
to
as
summary
affirmance
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
we've
said,
haven't
we
that
our
summary
affirmances
are
in
our
own
jurisprudence
entitled
to
less
weight
than
are
fully
written
out
opinion
for
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
do
--
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
whereas
in
the
--
in
hicks
against
miranda,
i
think
we
said
that
they
were
binding
on
lower
court
--
lower
federal
courts
in
cases
like
edelman
against
jordan,
we
have
said
they
were
entitled
to
some
weight
but
not
the
same
weight
that
a
fully
written
out
opinion
would
be,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
arguing
for
consideration
of
the
second
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
considered
the
agreement
between
the
labor
party
and
the
chicago
board,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
say
--
unless
i
am
--
got
the
wrong
brief
here
or
something,
this
--
that
the
seventh
circuit
did
hold
that
part
of
the
case
was
moot.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
don't
disagree
with
that
holding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
seventh
circuit
found
otherwise,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one,
did
they
--
did
not
resolve
the
substance
of
the
issue
because
they
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
concluded
it
was
moot.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
isn't
there
are
some
reason
for
us
thinking
that
the
seventh
circuit
probably
knows
what
the
cook
county
board
of
elections
might
do
in
the
future
better
than
we
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
to
split
them
up
among
counties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
you
could
get
25,000
signatures
in
cook
county.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
rockford
or
winnebago
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
colman,
under
our
practice,
isn't
it
usual
if
a
court
of
appeals
decides
that
an
issue
decided
by
a
district
court
is
moot
we
don't
simply
dismiss
the
appeal
but
we
direct
that
the
complaint
be
dismissed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
this
is
half
the
case.
this
is
a
different
issue
than
--
in
the
other
half
of
the
case
in
--
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
this
part
of
the
case
was
moot
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
but
in
--
because
of
the
agreement
that
it
had
been
entered
into.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
simply
because
the
election
had
passed
and
the
usual
capable
of
repetition
principle
didn't
apply
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
why
shouldn't
it
have
remanded
with
instructions
to
dissolve
the
injunction,
dismiss
the
complaint
as
to
that
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
an
independent
candidate
in
cook
county
just
needs
a
lot
bigger
base
of
support
than
a
statewide
candidate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
a
state
say
that
in
a
large
county
we
have
the
hypothetically
two
well-established
political
machines
of
the
regular
parties
and
an
independent
just
doesn't
have
much
of
a
chance
there
and
so
we're
going
to
require
more
for
him
run
in
that
particular
county
or
city
than
we
would
statewide
where
he
--
independent
has
a
much
larger
base
to
draw
on
statewide.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
maybe
a
rather
cynical
approach
but
could
a
state
say
that
for
constitutional
purposes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
could
be
both
cynical
and
real.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
resolve
the
statute
is
that
in
cook
county,
you
need
more
signatures
to
run
as
a
countywide
candidate
than
you
do
to
run
in
the
state
of
illinois
as
a
statewide
candidate.
now,
how
does
the
state
justify
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
if
the
courts
had
simply
let
the
legislative
plan
alone
from
the
beginning
it
would
be
a
lot
more
rational
than
it
is
now?
