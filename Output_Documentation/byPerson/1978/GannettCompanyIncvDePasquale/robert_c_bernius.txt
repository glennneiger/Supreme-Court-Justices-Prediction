mr.
robert
c.
bernius
thank
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
petitioner
gannett
company,
incorporated
which
seeks
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
what
restrictions
to
the
first
and
sixth
amendments
placed
upon
a
trial
judge,
rejects
the
public
and
press
from
a
traditionally
public
suppression
hearing
in
order
to
prevent
press
publication
concerning
that
hearing.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
honor,
i
believe
our
argument
is
based
first
on
the
first
amendment,
secondly
on
the
public
trial
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
they
are
two
separate
grounds
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
i
prefer
neither
your
honor.
i
think
they're
birth
--
both
equally
important.
i
think
the
damages
in
the
first
amendment
aspect
are
clear
as
are
they
in
the
sixth
amendment.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
very
brief.
case
arises
out
of
the
disappearance
in
mid-july
1976
of
a
rochester
man
while
fishing
on
the
finger
lakes
in
new
york
state.
respondents
greathouse
and
jones
were
subsequently
arrested
for
his
murder
and
in
november
1976,
a
suppression
hearing
in
the
case
was
commenced
before
judge
depasquale
in
seneca
county
court
which
is
located
approximately
40
miles
from
rochester.
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
the
defense
attorney
has
requested
that
the
public
and
press
be
ejected
saying
that
evidence
which
might
or
may
not
be
admitted
at
trial
would
be
heard
at
the
hearing.
judge
depasquale
with
no
inquiry
or
argument
and
without
hearing
any
evidence
whatsoever
in
--
or
making
any
findings
of
fact
ejected
the
public,
ejected
the
press.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes
your
honor
at
pages
4
through
6
of
the
appendix
is
the
transcript
of
that
ejection,
a
request
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
i
believe
so
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
it
is
not
in
the
record
before
this
court
your
honor.
it
was
released
after
the
defendants
pleaded
guilty
which
was
subsequent
to
the
time
that
the
special
proceeding,
prohibition
and
mandamus
was
commenced.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
honor,
at
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
at
the
initial
ejection,
there
was
no
colloquy
at
all
concerning
the
availability
of
a
transcript
in
the
future.
during
the
hearing,
the
reporter,
the
rochester
newspaper
reporter
who
had
been
excluded
asked
for
postponement
in
order
that
attorneys
might
appear
and
argue
that.
the
postponement
was
denied
and
the
hearing
finished
in
secret
on
friday
afternoon.
on
monday
morning,
attorneys
appeared
for
gannett
sought
vacator
of
the
order
of
closure
and
at
that
point
since
the
hearing
was
over,
we
asked
for
access
to
the
transcript.
judge
depasquale
heard
argument
on
our
motion
but
denied
vacator
of
the
order
and
also
denied
access
to
the
transcript
in
perpetuity.
after
the
plea
of
guilty,
he
had
a
change
of
heart
and
released
the
transcript
to
the
public
which
was
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
no,
it
has
not
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
honor,
the
entire
record
is
in
the
appendix.
transcript
of
the
suppression
hearing
was
not
part
of
the
record
in
the
appellate
division
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.this
is
a
separate
proceeding
distinct
from
the
criminal
proceeding.
it
was
a
special
proceeding.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
the
record
of
the
criminal
case
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
of
the
--
well
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
the
suppression
hearing
is
not
--
the
transcript
is
not
before
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes
your
honor,
there
was
no
trial.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
right.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes
your
honor.
what
happened
were
essentially
two
things.
we
were
notified
about
the
situation
immediately
or
shortly
before
the
suppression
hearing
in
the
criminal
case
ended.
that
was
on
a
friday
afternoon
and
this
is
an
outlying
county.
on
monday
morning,
i
essentially
appeared
as
an
interested
party
or
as
an
amicus
in
the
criminal
case.
i
went
back
to
judge
depasquale
to
ask
him
if
he
would
change
his
mind.
he
did
not
and
he
denied
our
motion.
the
next
day,
we
started
a
separate
distinct
civil
proceeding
of
prohibition
and
mandamus
in
the
appellate
division.
so
this
is
an
appeal
from
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that's
right
your
honor,
its
gannett
against
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
it's
a
civil
case.
it's
in
the
nature
of
prohibition
and
mandamus
challenging
the
orders
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
--
the
--
we
--
this
case
started
your
honor
with
the
petition
which
is
--
appears
at
page
21
--
page
19
of
the
appendix.
and
the
petition
challenges
the
orders
in
the
criminal
case
which
were
issued
by
judge
depasquale.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well,
yes.
the
orders
and
the
transcripts
of
the
criminal
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
--
proceeding
are
--
were
attached
as
exhibits
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
--
in
the
writ
of
prohibition.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that's
right
your
honor.
it
was
a
stenographer
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well,
what
has
happened
with
this
appendix
your
honor
is
that
things
have
been
put
in
a
chronological
order.
the
transcripts
of
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
no.
at
the
time
we
started
this
that
was
still
secret
and
it
was
sealed.
when
gannett
commenced
the
separate
civil
proceeding
and
mandamus
in
the
appellate
division,
next
to
that
--
those
papers
were
the
newspaper
articles
which
had
appeared
prior
to
the
closure.
now
those
articles
are
irrelevant
to
justify
the
closure
because
they
were
not
before
judge
depasquale.
he
did
not
consider
them
and
indeed,
no
reference
was
ever
made
by
any
of
the
respondents
to
those
articles.
but
i
would
submit
that
those
articles
are
directly
relevant
to
the
issue
before
this
court
because
they
demonstrate
and
put
in
a
factual
context
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
articles
appeared
over
a
course
of
approximately
two
and
a
half
weeks
from
the
time
of
the
disappearance
of
this
man
until
the
time
the
defendants
were
arraigned
on
the
murder
indictment.
they
appeared
on
seven
days
out
of
that
18-day
period
and
they
appeared
contemporaneously
with
the
major
events
in
the
criminal
investigation.
there
are
articles
in
the
morning
and
evening
paper
when
this
man
disappeared.
there
were
--and
then
there
were
articles
when
the
defendants
were
arrested,
when
they
were
indicted,
arraigned
and
so
on.
the
last
articles
appeared
at
the
time
of
the
defendants'
arraignment
which
was
91
days
before
the
commencement
of
the
suppression
hearing.
there
was
no
further
publicity
in
that
interim
period.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
if
--
a
criminal
trial
your
honor,
yes
i
do
and
i
think
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
yes
it
would
your
honor.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well,
that
is
i
think
irrelevant
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding,
that
that
deposition
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
criminal
trial.
i
would
assume
that
a
witness
is
going
to
testify.
the
parties
are
present.
there
is
an
oath.
there
is
cross-examination.
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
be
present.
all
the
characteristics
of
the
criminal
trial
itself,
the
post
jury
criminal
trial.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well
it
--
your
honor,
it
is
an
important
stage
in
the
process
and
there
is
a
development,
an
adversary
proceeding
to
develop
a
factual
record
upon
which
a
subsequent
determination
will
be
made.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
it
--
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well,
it
won't
be
made
based
on
that
but
there
is
no
guarantee
and
i
think
it's
--
the
analogy
to
a
suppression
hearing
is
clear
that
at
the
time
of
the
suppression
hearing
there's
no
guarantee
at
all
or
no
--
that
the
evidence
will
in
fact
be
admitted
a
trial.
in
fact,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
there
will
be
a
trial
but
nevertheless
that
is
--
could
well
be
the
critical
stage
in
the
process
but
if
the
testimony
of
the
suppression
hearing
transcript
is
not
to
be
offered
or
the
evidence
that
is
given
in
the
hearing
is
not
to
be
offered
at
trial,
the
reason
for
that
is
because
a
judge
makes
a
determination
that
that
evidence
is
not
admissible.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well,
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
not
in
a
strict
sense
but
in
a
generic
sense,
yes
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
a
jury
is
selected
is
a
mystical
concept
that
precludes
the
public's
right
to
attend
and
to
observe
and
be
aware
of
the
entire
gamut
of
the
proceedings
where
there
is
testimony,
where
there
is
cross-examination,
where
there
is
an
attempt
to
establish
either
the
prosecution's
point
or
the
defense
point.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well
your
honor,
it
speaks
in
terms
obviously
of
a
trial
but
it's
our
position
that
a
suppression
hearing
is
clearly
for
the
constitutional
purpose
as
part
of
the
trial.
in
fact,
the
statistics
are
that
90%
of
all
criminal
cases
and
100%
of
criminal
cases
in
seneca
county
for
two
and
a
half
years
were
completed
at
the
pretrial
stage.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well
your
honor,
i'd
--
there
is
a
distinction
obviously
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
where
there
is
a
formal
proceeding
and
adversary
proceeding,
witnesses
are
sworn
and
a
judge
is
going
to
make
a
determination
based
on
that
testimony,
a
determination
of
fact.
i
think
that
really
the
answer
to
the
question
of
when
does
a
trial
commence
is
to
be
found
in
the
purposes
that
are
served
by
the
public
trial
clause.
one
of
those
purposes
obviously
is
to
protect
the
defendant
and
see
that
his
interests
are
not
abused
by
the
prosecuting
authorities
but
it
goes
beyond
that.
there
are
interests
in
the
public,
specifically
third
parties
may
have
a
direct
interest
in
the
case
but
the
interest
of
the
public
in
seeing
that
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
honor,
i
think
that
based
on
the
prior
history
and
which
is
developed
at
--
to
a
certain
extent
in
our
brief
but
in
the
--
at
the
amicus
brief
for
the
national
association
of
broadcasters
more
extensively,
there
was
really
no
indication
that
a
common
law,
the
right
of
a
public
trial
accrued
to
the
defendant
at
all.
there
were
broader
purposes
behind
it
but
the
codification
was
in
the
constitution
i
think
recognizes
that
the
defendant
should
specifically
be
guaranteed
a
fair
trial,
a
public
trial
but
the
part
--
inherent
in
that
clause,
the
public
trial
clause
is
a
recognition
i
would
submit
that
the
public
has
an
equal
interest.
i
think
that
the
purposes
that
are
served
by
the
clause
mean
that
it
should
not
be
read
literally.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so
because
it
is
again
inherent
in
that
phrase,
public
trial
is
a
notion,
a
concept
that
the
public
has
an
interest
in
it
and
based
on
the
prior
history
of
common
law
and
based
on
the
purpose
it
served
by
the
public
trial
clause
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
i
think
your
honor
by
looking
at
the
history
and
really
analyzing
it
in
the
terms
of
the
essential
nature
of
the
guarantee
and
what
it
does.
the
overwhelming
purpose
served
is
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
the
insurance
of
the
confidence
of
the
public,
i
mean
in
the
judicial
system,
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
the
public
nature
of
trials
is
in
effect
necessary
to
the
vitality
of
that
system
and
its
viability.
i
don't
think
that
our
criminal
justice
system
would
long
last
if
proceedings
of
this
nature
were
held
in
secret
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
absolutely
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
i
think
so
your
honor,
yes.
i
do
--
we
do
not
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
no.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
absolutely
not.
we
think
that
the
public
right
is
equivalent
to
the
press
right.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that's
right.
the
--
their
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
no
your
honor
because
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
--
the
presence
of
the
public
or
the
press
that
the
conferences
of
this
court
or
any
other
court
would
be
basically
incompatible
with
the
primary
function
of
the
--
of
that
--
of
the
public
institution
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that's
right
but
it's
not
unli
--
it's
clearly
not
unlimited
your
honor
and
i
think
that
the
court
has
answered
that
in
some
of
the
present
cases
that's
answered
that
to
a
certain
extent
in
the
public
forum
cases,
marsh
against
alabama,
adderly
against
florida
that
was
--
the
cases
where
there
is
an
asserted
right
to
be
present
to
exercise
first
amendment
freedoms.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
the
primary
function
of
the
suppression
hearing
is
to
determine
your
honor
whether
a
jury
should
hear
specific
evidence
whether
it
is
sufficiently
reliable.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
the
--
no,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
the
orders
in
this
case
were
aimed
directly
at
publication.
they're
aimed
at
keeping
the
public
ignorant
of
the
facts
of
this
hearing.
and
their
--
that
the
basis
of
the
orders
is
public
ignorance
with
the
hope
that
somehow
an
indirect
benefit
will
filter
back
to
the
trial.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes
there
is
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
court
in
nebraska
press
very
much
dealt
at
length
with
the
problems
in
delaying
publication
of
news
concerning
the
criminal
justice
system.
secondly,
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
nebraska
press
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
--
was
a
pretrial
situation
your
honor.
the
delay
in
this
case
is
just
as
serious.
secondly,
its
--
if
the
order
in
this
case
is
in
a
sense
more
dramatic
than
in
nebraska
press
because
not
only
is
there
a
delay
but
there
is
an
absolute
denial
of
the
public's
knowledge
of
what
went
on
in
the
suppression
hearing.
as
an
appellate
court,
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
inadequacies
of
a
transcript
but
the
tones,
inflections,
gestures,
everything
that
makes
a
presence
of
a
--
of
the
trier
of
facts
so
necessary
into
a
determination,
none
of
those
things
can
be
recaptured
in
the
transcript.
and
finally
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
honor,
we
make
no
argument
at
all
that
suppression
hearings
must
be
open
under
all
circumstances.
we
simply
say
that
the
damage
done
to
both
first
amendment
interest
and
to
the
public
trial
interest
of
the
public
are
serious
and
that
if
closure
is
to
take
place,
it
should
take
place
only
as
the
last
resort.
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
closure
secret
proceedings
are
preferable
to
change
of
venue
to
continuance
to
an
extended
voir
dire,
all
those
separate
alternatives
that
this
court
has
on
--
repeatedly
said
and
would
have
been
effective
to
mitigate
the
effects
of
pretrial
publicity.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
honor,
i
--
that
is
--
it's
clear
that
when
if
there
is
a
continuance
or
a
change
of
venue
or
of
voir
dire,
to
some
extent
it's
going
to
inconvenience
a
defendant.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
the
vicinage
requirement
your
honor
deals
with
the
source
of
a
jury.
it
doesn't
really
deal
with
the
venue
of
the
case
and
i
think
that
the
history
of
the
vicinage
clause
indicates
that
in
--
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
sixth
amendment,
there
were
--
the
districts,
the
federal
judicial
districts
were
the
equivalent
of
the
states
with
the
exception
of
massachusetts
and
virginia
which
had
two
districts.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
vicinage
clause
is
of
any
pertinence
here
since
it's
number
one
outdated
and
number
two,
it
requires
a
jury
from
--
essentially
from
the
state
and
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
at
that
point,
the
defendants
would
have
to
make
a
choice
and
the
fact
that
a
venue
may
be
laid
in
a
certain
specific
area,
the
fact
that
continuance
would
somehow
interfere
with
a
speedy
trial.
those
are
considerations
that
all
must
be
weighed
but
i
don't
think
that
in
this
situation
where
there
are
important
first
amendment
rights
and
press
and
public
rights
that
one
--
anyone
guarantee
can
be
deemed
to
be
absolute.
what
we're
seeking
here
is
an
accommodation
of
all
these
potentially
conflicting
values.
what
--
there
is
your
honor,
no
conflict
in
this
case.
there
was
no
showing
that
publication
would
--
in
any
sense
have
prejudice
of
the
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial.
and
there's
also
been
no
showing
in
this
case
that
ejection
or
closure
of
this
hearing
would
have
help
to
mitigate
that
prejudice.
in
fact,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
they
moved
on
the
basis
that
evidence
which
may
or
may
not
be
admissible
at
trial
was
to
be
admitted
in
a
suppression
hearing
and
ask
for
it
to
be
closed.
i
don't
really
know
what
that
is.
i
have
--
we
assume
that
they
were
concerned
with
the
effects
of
pretrial
publicity
but
the
concern
is
not
enough
your
honor.
there
must
be
some
sort
of
showing
to
justify
this
unusual
and
we
submit
unconstitutional
procedure.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well
your
honor,
first,
the
most
dramatic
example
always
is
a
suppression
of
a
confession.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
in
many
cases,
that
the
confession
is
not
admitted
at
a
suppression
hearing.
it's
not
really
the
issue
at
a
suppression
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that's
right.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
we
assert
the
right
to
publish
whatever
we
heard
but
we
already
knew
that
there
was
a
confession
your
honor
and
we
could
have
published
that
no
matter
what
happened
at
the
hearing.
we
could
have
said
and
with
full
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well,
the
press
would
know
your
honor
that
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
evidence
that
there
was
--
or
there
was
a
confession
or
there
was
an
illegal
wiretap.
they
would
know
generically
what
was
going
on
at
that
hearing
and
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
and
i
--
and
that
the
fact
that
a
hearing
was
closed
would
not
diminish
the
prejudicial
impact
of
a
case.
it
in
fact
would
exaggerate
it
that
the
public
will
assume
the
worst
at
a
close
hearing.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
no
i'm
not
your
honor
but
i
think
that
the
defendants'
rights
are
not
absolutely
paramount
if
they're
not
--
if
there's
not
a
demonstration
that
they
are
in
fact
prejudiced.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
we
knew
that
it
was
a
confession
your
honor
and
we
knew
that
there
were
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that
we
knew
that
there
was
a
gun
that
had
been
seized.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
not
specifically.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
no.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes
your
honor
in
july.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
absolutely,
there
was
in
fact
the
day
after
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
it
was
--
i
--
there
was
no
reference
in
any
of
those
articles
to
a
confession
and
that's
an
important
point
your
honor
that
the
press
in
this
case
was
responsible
even
in
the
article
the
day
after
the
hearing
was
closed,
the
reporter
did
not
refer
to
the
--
to
his
confessions
or
guns.
she
said
--
she
described
it
as
evidence
which
might
have
been
deemed
admissible
at
trial.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
i
would've
argued
that
there
was
no
basis
for
the
closure
your
honor
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that's
one
aspect
to
it
that
that
closure
would
be
ineffective
because
we
could
--
it's
not
a
gag
order
on
the
press,
they
could
publish
the
singly
most
prejudicial
statement
that
could
be
made
is
that
the
defendants
confessed
and
we
could
have
published
that.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
what
i
meant
to
say
your
honor
is
that
there
must
be
an
accommodation
if
a
situation
arose
where
the
defendants'
right
to
a
fair
trial
was
on
the
line
against
the
public's
right,
first
amendment
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
we
do
not
say
that
the
defendants'
right
should
be
and
should
not
be
paramount.
but
it's
important
to
require
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
and
trial
courts
throughout
the
country
not
to
abrogate
the
rights
of
the
press
and
public
unless
it's
absolutely
necessary.
and
that
a
threat,
an
actual
threat,
danger
to
a
fair
trial
is
shown
and
that
--
and
there's
a
showing
made
that
the
ejection
or
closure
would
be
effective
and
finally
and
most
importantly,
there
is
a
showing
made
that
a
traditional
sheppard
alternatives
would
be
ineffective
to
cure
that
danger.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
honor,
we
would
obviously
have
the
option
of
commencing
a
special
proceeding
just
as
we
did
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
your
honor,
it's
the
--
i
would
submit
that
the
appropriate
findings
that
have
to
be
made
are
the
findings
in
the
--
are
articulated
in
nebraska
press
and
the
fact
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
certainly,
there's
a
--
always
the
possibility
that
it
could
be
challenged
in
a
separate
proceeding
under
the
law
of
new
york
state
your
honor
but
i
doubt
very
much
certainly
in
this
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that's
absolutely
your
honor
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
not
necessarily.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that
would
be
an
editorial
judgment
your
honor
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
we
want
the
right
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
a
finding
that
and
a
basis
for
a
finding
that
change
a
venue
to
an
adjoining
county
would
not
have
cured
the
prejudice.
here,
we
had
a
circulation
of
1500
newspapers
and
a
population
of
36,000
in
seneca
county.
the
adjoining
counties
have
350,000
people
and
judicial
district
at
almost
4
million
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
we're
talking
about
the
public
and
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
that's
right.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
well,
that's
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
certainly
and
that's
not
relevant
in
this
case
because
there's
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
television
or
radio
coverage.
and
in
general,
i
--
it
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
there
was
your
honor
or
would
have
been.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
in
this
case,
in
--
yes.
but
in
--
obviously
the
--
in
--
as
in
rideau,
television
coverage
is
certainly
relevant
and
should
be
considered.
but
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
considered
and
the
effect
of
a
continuance
of
voir
dire
should
be
evaluated.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
under
the
nebraska
press
test
your
honor.
but
the
fact
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
bernius
the
colloquy
among
lawyers
who
are
involved
in
this
your
honor
is
that
this
is
--
this
situation
is
a
direct
result
of
the
nebraska
press
decision
and
it's
our
feeling
that
the
mechanism
even
though
the
mechanism
is
ejection
rather
than
injunction,
the
damages
are
at
least
as
great
and
the
standards
in
nebraska
press
should
be
complied
with.
thank
you.
