justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
take
that
so
far
as
to
have
the
right
to
be
present
at
a
conference
of
members
of
an
appellate
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
i
thought
you
based
your
approach
a
little
while
ago
on
the
right
to
gather
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bernius,
what
is
the
primary
function
of
the
suppression
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
court
determines
that
it
should
not
be
heard
and
if
the
press
has
heard
that
evidence,
is
there
any
restriction
on
the
press
publishing
it
so
it
will
come
to
the
attention
of
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
how
could
the
primary
function
of
the
suppression
hearing
be
performed
if
you're
correct?well,
your
honor
there
is
--
that
is
really
i
believe
the
--
one
of
the
principle
faults
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
the
assumption
that
publication
by
definition
means
a
--
that
the
jury
will
be
affected
by
this
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
mr.
bernius,
both
defense
lawyers
move
for
the
closure
on
the
very
ground
that
they
thought
they'd
be
prejudiced.
wasn't
that
the
ground
the
reason
it
was
closed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
sort
of
showing
would
they
make
in
open
court
without
revealing
the
very
thing
they
wanted
to
conceal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
fact
that
a
confession
had
been
made
would
have
to
be
disclosed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
not
that
be
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
if
it
were
published
in
the
press
and
did
you
not
assert
the
right
to
publish
whatever
you
heard
at
the
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
in
this
case
but
in
the
normal
--
in
every
case,
it
isn't
true
that
the
press
would
know
whether
there
was
a
confession
in
advance,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
really
think
that
you're
a
better
judge
of
what's
good
for
the
defendants'
trial
posture
than
their
own
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
mr.
bernius,
suppose
in
this
case
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
it
had
--
the
issue
was
a
confession
and
the
judge
says,
i've
read
the
confession
and
if
the
newspapers
and
the
media
really
do
their
job
in
getting
the
word
out
which
they
apparently
want
to
do
and
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
people
hear
about
this.
and
it's
going
to
make
it
very
difficult
to
get
a
jury
and
he
makes
a
finding
that
there
is
a
serious
danger
to
the
fair
trial
rights
of
the
defendant.
i
suppose
you
take
that
up
on
appeal,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know
but
you
wouldn't
lie
still
for
that,
i
take
it.
i
just
--
i
would
just
like
to
know
what
kind
of
findings
in
--
by
the
trial
judge
would
--
that
you
would
accept?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
suppose
he
makes
them
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
kind
of
evidence
and
what
kind
of
danger
would
you
think
would
have
to
be
present
--
that
wouldn't
be
present
when
there
is
a
flat
out
confession
of
the
crime
by
the
defendant
and
the
interested
media.
i
take
it
you
think
its
--
that
in
this
case
at
least
it
was
news.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
were
going
to
--
and
you
were
interested
in
publishing
the
result
--
the
--
what
went
on
at
the
suppression
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
innocent
in
publishing
the
confession
if
there
was
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
wanted
the
right
to
publish
it
anyway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
you
want
the
right
to
publish.
and
so
what
kind
of
evidence
would
be
sufficient
to
--
on
the
judges'
conclusion
that
there
is
a
real
danger
to
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
aren't
just
talking
about
the
newspapers,
aren't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
we're
talking
about
the
media
and
we're
talking
about
television.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
it
doesn't
do
you
any
good
to
talk
about
1500
newspapers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
to
talk
about
television
--
the
reach
of
television
coverage,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
don't
suppose
there
wouldn't
be,
would
you
if
there
was
an
open
suppression
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
when
you
make
that
statement,
are
you
basing
it
on
what's
in
the
appendix?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
far
different
than
in
some
of
the
other
cases
that
had
been
decided
here,
isn't
that
--
it
doesn't
strike
you
as
rather
routine
reporting,
factual
reporting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
comparing
that
with
the
material
in
murphy
against
florida
for
instance?
