of
determinations
did

r.
white
--
denied
the

what

they

take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
are
you
--
your
argument
is
that
it's
the
defendant's
right?
justice

r.
white
do
you
think
the
threat
to
the
fair
trial
rights
of
the

are
as
great
from
admissible
evidence
being
published
ahead
of
time
as
inadmissible
or
not?

i
know
but
suppose
you
know
in
voir
dire
you
asked
the
jury
have
your
read
about
this
case?
they
say,
"yeah,
we've
read
all
about
it".
what
do
you
as
a
defense
counsel
do
say
in
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
shrug
your
shoulders
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
one
of
them
says,
"i
read
a
verbatim
transcript
published
in
the
paper
of
the
suppression
hearing
which
turned
out
that
--
and
the
evidence
was
admissible"?
