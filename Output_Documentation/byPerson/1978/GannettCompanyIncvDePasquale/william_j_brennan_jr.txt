justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
it
been
lodged
with
us
mr.
bernius?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
your
answer
is
no,
the
entire
record
isn't
here,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
you
make
part
of
the
record
on
that
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
attached
to
it
as
exhibits
or
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
attached
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
take
it
this
was
a
stenographic
transcript
not
a
tape
recording.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bernius,
you
argue
anyway
don't
you
that
independently
of
the
sixth
amendment
public
trial
that
the
press
at
least
has
the
first
amendment
right
to
be
present.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
before
you
get
in
to
that,
i
know
you're
going
to
argue
that,
i
hope,
but
what
if
--
does
the
public
also
have
a
first
amendment
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
claim
any
more
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
press
than
for
the
public?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
first
amendment
and
not
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
honor
the
--
i
believe
i
have
an
analogous
case
history.
first,
there
was
no
--
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
public
and
the
press
had
a
right
to
be
present
prior
to
the
motion
to
exclude
them.
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
in
its
opinion,
the
respondents
concede
that.
it's
--
the
right
to
be
present
i
think
derives
primarily
from
the
right
to
gather
information
which
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
branzburg
and
i
know
that
the
right
to
gather
information
is
not
without
limits
but
i
would
submit
that
if
there
is
any
sort
of
right
to
gather
information,
it
must
exist
at
trials,
it
must
exist
in
the
streets
and
other
public
forums
and
i
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
right
to
gather
information,
the
public
forum
test
which
was
developed
in
most
specifically
articulated
in
the
grayned
case
gives
very
pertinent
guidance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say,
(inaudible)
knew
here
what
it
was
that
the
defense
wanted
to
suppress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
know
but
do
we
know
that
the
motion
to
suppress
identified
the
--
either
it's
must
have
i
suppose
that
were
sought
to
be
suppressed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
know
--
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
tell
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
didn't
you
--
i
know
that
the
gun
was
found
in
michigan,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
hadn't
the
papers
already
published
that
before
the
suppression
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
--
you
knew
that
there
was
a
confession
which
you
had
not
--
had
not
printed
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
absolutely
it
was
or
was
not
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
would
have
a
hearing,
i
gather
one
of
your
protests
here
is
that
you
should've
had
a
hearing
before
the
order
of
closure
issued,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you
had,
what
would
you
have
argued?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
the
ground
that
whatever
was
the
subject
to
the
motion
to
suppress
had
already
been
published?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bernius
may
i
ask
you.
whether
with
or
without
a
prior
hearing
there
had
been
no
closure
order
and
you
had
sat
--
and
members
of
the
public
however
many
of
them
were
through
the
suppression
hearing
and
at
the
close
of
it,
the
judge
had
then
issued
an
order
that
you
not
publish
until
at
least
after
a
jury
had
been
chosen
and
sequestered.
anything
that
you
heard
that
day
and
similarly
address
such
an
order
to
the
general
public
whoever
they
are
present
at
the
time,
you'd
still
be
here,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
what
ground
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
wouldn't
--
you
--
it
would
just
be
a
timesaver
is
it
--
or
would
it
be
anything
other
than
saving
your
time
if
there
was
a
hearing
about
why
it
was
important
to
close
the
proceedings
and
why
some
other
mechanisms
wouldn't
suffice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
isn't
what
the
trial
judge
did,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
they
made
motions
later.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
money
--
must
the
exclusion
however
be
the
last
alternative
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kobroff,
can
you
identify
what
it
was
they
wanted
suppressed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
is
not
in
the
record
before
us
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
had
there
been
any
publication
of
what
it
was
that
the
physical
evidence
was
found
in
michigan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
the
motion
is
suppressed
also,
was
addressed
to
statements
made
to
michigan
police?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there'd
been
no
publication
that
they
had
made
such
statements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
to
the
extent
that
though
this
already
had
been
published,
why
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
is
this
down
merely
to
the
substance
of
the
confessions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
kobroff,
would
you
be
defending
this
closure
if
everything
that
was
a
subject
to
the
motion
to
suppress
was
already
been
published?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
justification
would
there
been
for
the
closure
of
everything
that
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
subject
to
the
motion
to
suppress
and
then
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
defense
counsel.
i'm
asking
what
justification
would
there
been
for
the
order
of
closure
in
that
circumstance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
suggest
he
is.
he
can
make
the
motion.
i'm
just
asking
why
the
judge
would
enter
an
order
of
closure
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
everything
or
a
subject
to
motion
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
even
of
public
knowledge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
it
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
--
do
you
see
any
constitutional
problems
had
--
what
judge
depasquale
did
say,
"well,
the
press
may
stay
and
public
may
stay".
and
they
heard
the
whole
thing
and
at
the
close
of
it,
he
said,
"well,
this
maybe
prejudicial".
and
he
issues
an
order
directed
to
the
press
and
public
present.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
judge's
decision
in
this
case
on
admissibility?
