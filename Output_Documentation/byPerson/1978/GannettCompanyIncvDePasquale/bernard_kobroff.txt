mr.
bernard
kobroff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
right
to
a
public
trial
is
neither
an
absolute
right
of
the
public
nor
of
the
press.
pretrial
hearings
and
portions
of
trials
had
been
closed
to
the
public
including
the
media
for
such
situations
as
preventing
disclosure
of
skyjack
profile
testimony
insuring
the
emotional
and
physical
health
of
the
pregnant
witness
protecting
the
identity
of
an
undercover
agent
permitting
a
prosecutrix
to
testify
uninhibitedly
at
a
trial.
respondent
submit
that
the
need
to
preserve
an
accused
constitutional
right
to
an
impartial
jury
in
the
county
of
venue
is
as
important
as
any
of
these
other
interest
which
have
been
held
to
justify
closure
of
criminal
proceedings.
respondents
call
edwin
greathouse
and
david
ray
jones
challenged
the
admissibility
of
confessions
that
they
had
given
to
michigan
police
and
physical
fruits
that
these
confessions
had
led
the
police
to
seize.
respondent
judge
depasquale
was
required
to
resolve
that
this
evidence
had
not
been
obtained
in
violation
of
the
accused
constitutional
rights.
the
admission
of
this
evidence,
this
full
confessions
to
the
alleged
murder
and
robbery
were
undoubtedly
had
been
prejudicial
to
these
defendants
at
their
trial
and
widespread
dissemination
of
these
confessions
prior
to
trial
could
nonetheless
have
predetermined
their
guilt
in
seneca
county.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
the
press
is
certainly
entitled
to
have
their
views
known
before
the
court.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
the
situation
that
was
presented
to
judge
depasquale
was
that
this
motion
was
made.
there
were
at
least
three
reporters
representing
three
different
newspapers
in
the
courtroom.
none
of
them
mentioned
any
objections
to
it.
the
district
attorney
agreed
in
effect
with
the
defendants
and
their
motion
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
they
did
in
fact
make
motions
later
and
judge
depasquale
did
in
fact
hold
the
hearing
and
listened
to
their
arguments,
so
they
did
have
the
hearing.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
no,
no.
i
mean
judge
depasquale
heard
this
argument,
heard
both
sides
and
then
determined
that
there
will
be
a
reasonable
probability
of
prejudice
to
these
defendants
had
the
media
gotten
access
to
these
confessions
and
disseminated
them.
this
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
this
was
his
finding.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
the
only
reference
to
that
is
one
of
the
defense
lawyers
in
the
transcript
mentions
change
of
venue
that
is
the
only
alternative
specifically
mentioned
in
the
appendix
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
what?
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
they
obviously
mentioned
the
alternatives
mentioned
by
this
court
in
sheppard,
in
the
opinion.
what
you've
got
here
though
which
make
it
different
i
think
then
what
these
alternatives,
the
sheppard
alternatives
will
do
--
is
here,
the
actual
the
actual
poison
had
not
been
put
out
into
the
community.
we're
not
in
a
situation
where
we're
mitigating
damage
that's
already
being
done,
that's
already
out.
we've
got
a
situation
where
the
damage
isn't
yet
been
done.
the
--
it
isn't
widespread
and
we
have
an
opportunity
to
stop
it
at
its
inception.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
the
gun
and
that's
true
and
for
that,
we
might
well
--
this
isn't
the
only
alternative
available
to
a
court
to
deal
with
prejudicial
publicity.
i
mean
we
have
in
fact
the
sheppard
measures
that
they
might
also
have
to
be
used.
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
the
difficulty
with
exclusion
is
the
last
alternative
is
that
if
you
wait
till
the
voir
dire
or
if
you
wait
till
change
of
venue
can
be
done,
the
hearing
is
already
over.
it's
too
late.
exclusion
is
a
prophylactic
and
in
a
certain
situation,
unusual
situation
and
there's
no
denying,
this
is
an
unusual
case.
it
is
effective
and
it
should
be
available
to
a
trial
court.
it
is
a
fundamental
tenant
of
due
process
that
the
conclusions
to
be
reached
in
a
case
will
be
induced
only
by
evidence
and
argument
in
open
court
and
not
by
any
outside
influence
whether
of
private
talk
or
public
print.
judge
depasquale
had
the
obligation
to
prevent
suppressed
evidence
from
determining
the
guilt
of
greathouse
and
jones
and
certainly
from
determining
their
guilt
prior
to
trial.
to
prevent
the
jury
from
learning
of
a
coerced
confession
during
trial
yet
all
along
needlessly
making
it
available
to
them
to
read
or
hear
of
it
before
trial,
knocks
the
claim
that
our
system
of
law
has
always
endeavored
to
prevent
even
the
probability
of
unfairness.
for
judge
depasquale
to
have
allowed
public
disclosure
of
potentially
tainted
evidence
which
he
had
the
constitutional
duty
to
exclude
would
involve
the
court
itself
in
this
taint
and
illegality.
respondent
greathouse
and
jones
were
out
of
state
transience,
they're
accused
to
the
murder
and
robbery
of
a
local
area
resident
wayne
clapp,
a
former
police
officer
with
roots
in
the
community.
they
have
fled
--
the
respondent
and
jones
had
fled
seneca
county
sooner
after
clapp's
disappearance
and
they
were
arrested
in
michigan
several
days
later.
there
they
allegedly
gave
these
confessions
which
were
the
object
to
this
motion.
if
they
had
prevailed
at
this
hearing,
they
had
a
triable
defense.
the
people's
case
was
entirely
circumstantial.
three
men
leave
on
a
boat
to
return.
gunshots
are
heard,
anchors
are
missing
but
there
is
no
body,
there
is
no
decease,
no
corpse
and
no
eyewitnesses
to
any
crime.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
never,
never
found.
however,
if
they're
unsuccessful
at
the
suppression
motion,
the
defense
is
almost
hopeless.
the
full
confessions
to
the
crime
plus
the
murder
weapon
itself
is
in
evidence.
this
case
had
already
generated
extensive
media
publicity
throughout
seneca
county.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
think
we
can
accept
that.
i
think
you
can
also
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
oh,
your
honor,
i
--
they
might
--
they
claim
it
to
be
factual
reports
but
as
a
defense
attorney
trying
this
case
i
mean
you
would
not
want
to
accept
that
as
factual
reports.
these
are
untested,
unreliable
rumors.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
alright.
the
thing
with
murphy
is
when
there
was
no
confession
that
was
confronting
that
or
would
possibly
have
been
testified
and
it
report
in
the
press.
i
think
that's
a
major
distinction
from
what
we
had
in
murphy.
on
the
day
of
the
suppression
motion,
we
had
three
reporters
in
the
courtroom
that
we
know
of.
petitioner's
reporter,
a
reporter
from
the
geneva
times
and
a
reporter
from
the
syracuse
post.
together,
these
papers
accounted
from
us
the
85%
of
the
daily
newspaper
circulation
in
seneca
county.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
no,
no.
none
of
these
papers
are
published
in
seneca
county.
geneva
is
in
ontario
county
which
is
a
few
miles
away.
the
only
newspaper
actually
published
in
seneca
county
is
a
weekly
newspaper.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
seneca
county
--
oh,
it
is
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
believe
waterloo.
an
additional
6%
of
the
daily
newspaper
circulation
of
seneca
county
is
accounted
for
by
petitioner's
ethical
journal
paper
which
he
owns
and
is
distributed
there.
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
this
petitioner
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
no,
no.
i
just
want
to
state
them
to
make
the
point
that
in
fact
what
would
have
occurred
at
this
hearing
would
have
been
widely
and
immediately
disseminated.
i
think
that
three
newspapers,
well,
not
with
three
reporters
in
seneca
county
courthouse
unless
they
feel
there's
a
new
story
and
unless
they're
going
to
use
it.
that's
the
only
reason
and
the
fact
that
they
do
have
the
circulation
in
that
county.
greathouse
and
jones
moved
for
the
exclusion
of
these
media
representatives.
they
argued
that
the
deleterious
effects
of
disclosures
of
the
evidence
they
sought
to
suppress,
sought
to
be
suppressed
would
outweigh
their
right
to
a
public
trial.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
they
made
a
motion
to
suppress
physical
evidence.
the
motions
of
statements
made
to
michigan
police
and
the
fruits
that
these
confessions
had
lived
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
the
substance
of
the
confessions
has
not
been
published.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
no.
i
mean
the
actual
word
itself
confession
hadn't
been
used,
they
used
inadmissible
statements.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
it
would
appear
so.
but
nevertheless
the
accused
did
not
necessarily
feel
they
had
to
run
the
risk
that
when
they
see
two
reporters
in
the
courtroom
that
this
might
continue
it.
up
to
now,
they
had
not
gotten
the
substance
of
the
confessions.
they
knew
that
--
you
know,
it
had
been
reported
that
police
who
were
in
michigan
interviewing
these
suspects
to
learn
the
apparent
motive
for
the
slain.
so
they
knew
that
they
had
gotten
something
from
their
interviews
but
they
didn't
know
what
and
now,
on
the
day
of
the
suppression
hearing,
they
are
going
to
find
out
what
the
“motive”
for
the
apparent
slain
was.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
right,
i
would
say
that's
not
exactly
a
fact.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes,
i
think
he
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
they
had
a
lot
of
damaging
evidence
in
there.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
right.
it's
the
confession.
that
would
be
it.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
i
think
in
this
case,
that's
the
difference
perhaps
between
having
a
triable
defense
and
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes,
i
think
that
they
could
still
make
their
emotion.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
think
that
the
defense
counsel
would
certainly
make
the
motion.
i
mean
whether
the
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
the
same
that
it
would
threaten
their
right
to
get
an
impartial
jury
in
that
county.
the
--
simply
because
the
press
has
this
information
simply
because
the
press
can
publish
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
defendant
is
therefore
is
stopped
from
trying
this,
you
know
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
that
he
might
well
not
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
he
might
well
not.
i
mean
he
could
well
take
this
into
consideration
and
say,
"well,
given
this
situation
i
don't
find
a
threat
and
i
won't
do
it".
on
the
other
hand
he
might
well
say,
"well
yes,
i'm
going
to
do
this
and
i'm
going
to
--
then
continue
the
case
and
you've
waive
your
right
to
speak".
he
might
--
they
might
play
the
whole
instances
of
things
he
could
do
even
though
the
information
is
out.
i
assume
in
saying
that
it
shouldn't
foreclose
the
defendant
or
the
judge
from
having
this
power
to
--
these
means
of
protecting
the
defendant's
rights
simply
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
i
would
first
of
all
say
that
i
think
that's
a
very
unlikely
situation.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
think
that
if
that
--
if
such
a
statute
was
ever
enacted
by
the
state
legislature,
it
might
well
raise
constitutional
problems.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
public
is
the
ultimate
sovereign.
the
public
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
--
has
the
right
to
know.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
think
that's
a
--
i
think
that
you
have
--
that's
a
little
different
i
think
than
perhaps
a
public
trial
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
--
by
definition
a
public
trial.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
no,
i
just
meant
that
it
--
in
comparison
to
an
executive
closure
of
a
cabinet
meeting
as
compared
to
that
difference.
i
think
that
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes
it
is.
i
would
also
say
though
that
its
also
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
of
every
other
state
that
there
are
other
societal
interest
that
are
advanced
by
the
right
of
public
trial
independent
of
an
accused
right
to
a
public
trial.
i
think
it
--
there
are
two
sources.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes,
i
believe
i've
cited
it
in
my
brief.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
it's
308
new
york
56,
123
northeast
2nd
769.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
123
northeast
2nd
769.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
no.
your
honor,
the
prosecutor
didn't.
he
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
believe
it
was
certain
of
the
statements.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
no,
i
believe
--
the
papers
were
filed
that
would've
have
referred
to
the
physical
evidence.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
those
were
filed
though.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
no,
they
were
not
sealed.
i
believe
to
answer
your
question.
i
think
that
most
of
the
source
of
the
news
seemed
to
be
the
state
police,
a
david
(inaudible)
was
referred
to
in
various
of
the
articles
as
giving
various
quotes.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
no.
the
situation
isn't
the
same.
i
mean
if
the
evidence
is
admissible,
there's
no
reason
to
insolate
the
jury
from
it.
they're
going
to
hear
about
it
anyway.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
ask
a
few
more
questions
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
no,
no.
i
asked
a
few
more
questions
to
see
exactly
what
they've
read
and
where
they've
read
it
and
how
it
might
have
affected
them.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
i
don't
think
i
have
cause
but
i
might
not
want
them
anyway.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes,
yes.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
it
wasn't
part
of
--
this
is
a
collateral
proceeding
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
--
to
the
case.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes.
but
no,
it
was
not
sent
here.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
suppose
so.
i'd
tell
you
what
i
do
have
with
me
if
your
honors
would
want
it
is
a
copy
of
judge
depasquale's
decision
on
the
hearing
that
much
i
have
with
me
if
your
honors
would
want.
i
don't
know
how
permissive
this
is.
judge
depasquale
could
not
close
this
as
to
the
obvious,
needles
prejudice
the
accused
constitutional
right
that
was
about
to
occur.
he
had
the
duty
to
protect
the
respondents
greathouse
and
jones'
right
to
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
in
the
county
of
venue
and
he
did
what
any
prudent
judge
would
have
done.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
don't
think
he
could
do
that.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
think
nebraska
press
pretty
well
decided
that
issue.
that's
just
not
available.
i
mean
--
and
in
addition,
i
think
this
course
--
this
court
had
even
held
in
nebraska
press
that
what
occurs
at
a
public
hearing
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
--
cannot
be
prior
--
cannot
be
a
subject
to
a
prior
restraint.
so
that
option
was
never
even
available
to
him
as
far
as
that
goes.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
that
seems
to
be
the
rule.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
certain
confessions,
certain
statements
were
suppressed,
the
others
were
not.
apparently,
certain
statements
were
made
and
then
he
requested
the
attorneys
then
more
statements
were
made
and
so
on.
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
constitutional
right
of
an
accused
to
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
in
the
county
of
venue
and
the
right
of
the
public
including
potential
jurors
and
media
representatives
have
immediate
access
to
pretrial
evidentiary
suppression
hearings.
the
case
does
not
concern
the
right
of
the
press
to
publish
free
from
prior
restraints.
there
were
no
restraints
on
press
publication
in
this
case.
no
injunctions
restraining
the
press
from
publishing
anything
it
wanted
to.
no
contempt
citations
punishing
the
press
for
having
published
anything.
petitioner's
error
is
in
equating
a
temporary
denial
of
public
access
to
potentially
inadmissible
evidence
where
the
court
ordered
direct
restraint
on
publication.
the
press
was
at
all
time
free
to
publish
anything
it
wanted
to
about
the
case
at
people
v.greathouse
and
jones.
yet
the
press
had
learned
that
what
transpired
at
this
in
camera
proceeding,
their
publication
of
this
evidence
would've
been
unrestrained.
petitioner
nonetheless
argues
that
the
public
including
prospective
jurors'
right
to
immediate
access
to
this
testimony,
testimony
untested
by
constitutional
standards
as
to
reliability,
admissibility,
testimony
found
to
be
probably
destructive
of
an
accused
constitutional
right
to
an
impartial
jury
that
this
right
to
immediate
access
is
entitled
with
the
same
constitutional
protection
as
the
press'
right
to
publish
free
from
governmental
censorship.
respondent
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
in
law
or
reason
for
this
equation.
this
has
never
been
the
requirement.
this
has
never
been
the
standard
of
--
to
deny
used
in
instances
where
courtrooms
had
been
closed
and
none
of
the
instances
to
protect
the
identity
of
an
undercover
agent
to
allow
witness
to
testify
uninhibitedly.
this
has
never
been
the
standard
used.
and
such
a
standard
would
severely
undermine
an
accused
constitutional
right
to
an
impartial
jury.
and
without
an
impartial
jury,
any
other
right
granted
to
an
accused
is
meaningless.
an
important
value
in
our
society,
a
value
embodied
in
the
constitution
is
of
the
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
in
the
county
where
the
crime
was
allegedly
committed.
this
requirement
of
a
fair
trial
has
been
interpreted
to
me
not
only
the
absence
of
actual
bias
but
even
the
absence
of
a
probability
of
unfairness.
to
further
protect
the
rights
of
an
accused,
our
society
extends
reasonable
doubt
and
presumption
of
innocence
and
other
burdens
in
favor
of
an
accused.
before
a
confession
could
be
offered
in
evidence
against
an
accused,
he
must
first
have
been
determined
by
at
the
least
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
to
have
been
knowingly
voluntarily
and
intelligently
given.
if
it
is
determined
that
a
jury
even
considered
a
coerced
confession,
it
is
automatic
reversal,
can
never
be
a
harmless
error.
yet
petitioner
insist
that
before
a
court
can
exclude
the
public
including
prospective
jurors
from
the
hearing
involving
a
coerced
confession
that
the
accuse
must
in
open
court
and
in
an
adversarial
proceeding
satisfy
the
awesome
standard
necessary
to
justify
governmental
censorship.
respondent
submit
that
the
standard
certainly
gives
an
accused
far
less
than
he
has
a
right
to
expect
in
our
society
and
under
the
constitution.
petitioner
bases
his
argument
on
the
public
and
potential
jurors'
right
to
immediate
access
to
suppression
hearing
testimony
on
the
fact
that
the
flow
of
information
to
the
public
concerning
pretrial
suppression
hearings
is
vital
to
public
understanding
of
the
judicial
system.
there
is
no
claim
here
that
the
press'
right
to
publish
is
being
restrained.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
perhaps.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
would
think
that
it
probably
wouldn't
be
necessary
in
that
case.
i
mean
if
the
jury
is
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
would
think
that
it
--
as
soon
as
you
have
a
jury
and
you
can
insolate
the
jury
that
the
defendant's
interests
are
just
no
longer
in
jeopardy.
i
mean
the
threat
here
is
that
you've
got
potential
jurors.
you've
got
the
perspective
jurors
sitting
in
the
courtroom
and
you've
got
to
insolate
them.
i
mean,
you're
required
to
and
this
is
the
means
to
do
it.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes,
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
mean
these
are
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
think
that
if
you
have
a
record
that
runs
a
couple
of
hundred
pages,
you
can
simply
buy
perhaps
picking
various
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
don't
know.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
it
might
not
be
the
best
of
them
all.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
right,
right,
in
that
sense,
yes.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
agree.
i'm
simply
saying
that
it's
still
newsworthy.
i
mean
this
case
is
moot,
it's
been
moot
now
for
almost
two
years
and
it
is
still
newsworthy.
you're
right
though
but
it
still
--
they
were
there
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
i
mean
you're
--
you've
got
to
--
it's
not
an
easy
decision
for
this
court.
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
i
mean
you've
got
a
balancing
here
you've
got
serious
rights
that
are
affected.
you've
got
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
i
will
tell
you,
i'm
not
a
newspaper
reporter
and
perhaps
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
yes.
i
didn't
--
i've
also
read
some
novels
back
you
know
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
i
think
they
wanted
it
immediately.
mr.
bernard
kobroff
well,
i
think
they
felt
there
was
--
this
was
a
good
news
story
and
the
next
day,
it
might
make
a
--
mr.
bernard
kobroff
it's
their
business
decision.
i
don't
think
the
gannett
newspapers
does
badly
making
business
decisions.
the
right
of
the
--
the
right
to
the
access
--
right
of
access
to
this
transcript
has
not
been
denied
and
is
not
being
denied.
this
transcript
will
enable
the
public
to
continue
to
monitor
the
criminal
justice
system.
it
will
enable
it
to
assure
itself
that
the
accused
is
in
fact
being
treated
fairly
to
assure
itself
that
public
officials
are
correctly
performing
their
duties
to
assure
itself
that
no
judicial
or
prosecutorial
irregularities
have
occurred.
if
there
is
any
absolute
in
our
constitutional
system
is
that
an
accused
must
receive
a
fair
trial
before
it
can
be
lawfully
convicted.
of
primary
consideration
is
the
public's
interest
in
avoiding
anything
that
would
truncate
this
right.
to
maintain
an
accused
right
to
an
impartial
jury
as
the
arbiter
of
guilt
or
innocence,
the
hearing
judge
must
have
the
means
to
ensure
their
perspective
endearment
to
not
hear
him
out
as
which
by
law
they
are
to
be
insolated
from.
respondents
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
reaches
a
wise
balancing
between
the
right
of
the
press
to
publish
free
from
governmental
restraint
and
the
right
of
an
accused
to
an
impartial
jury
in
the
county
of
venue.
respondents
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
