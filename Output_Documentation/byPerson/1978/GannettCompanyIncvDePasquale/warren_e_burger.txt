chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
1301,
gannett
company
against
depasquale.
mr.
bernius
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
of
this
original
order
indicate
that
the
transcript
would
or
would
not
be
available
when
the
case
was
terminated
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
when
the
trial
was
terminated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
record
of
the
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
he
entered
a
plea,
a
trial
at
some
stage
began
in
trying
to
separate
the
pretrial
from
what
he
decided
to
do
finally
was
to
plead
guilty,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
pretrial
covers
all
of
the
things
you've
been
telling
us
about
on
the
exclusion
of
the
public.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
in
a
criminal
trial
mr.
bernius,
the
--
either
the
prosecution
or
the
defense
wants
to
take
a
deposition
of
an
absent
witness
either
out
of
the
united
states
or
situated
in
someway
where
attendance,
personal
attendance
can't
be
compelled.
would
you
think
the
sixth
amendment
and
your
other
arguments
would
require
that
the
taking
of
the
testimony
of
that
witness
be
a
public
open
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
not
a
criminal
trial,
very
carefully
he
stood
before
trial
--
pretrial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
it's
never
offered
in
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
s
it
not
common
that
in
pretrial
depositions
both
in
civil
and
criminal
cases
that
particularly
if
no
judge
is
present
and
that's
usually
the
case
that
there
are
many
question
which
you're
asked
and
answered
with
the
reserved
right
to
challenge
their
admissibility
at
the
--
when
asked
and
if
the
deposition
is
offered,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
was
it
part
of
the
trial
until
it's
offered
in
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
will
the
subsequent
determination
be
made
if
it's
never
offered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
will
there
be
for
the
court
to
rule
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
only
circumstance?
what
if
for
the
party
who
has
called
for
the
deposition
just
decides
that
isn't
needed
and
therefore
he
doesn't
offer
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
that
the
prosecution
takes
this
pretrial
testimony
in
an
abundance
of
caution
and
when
they
put
their
case
in
they
find
they
approved
--
established
the
same
facts
by
other
witnesses
and
they
never
bothered
to
put
the
deposition
in
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
part
of
the
trial
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
the
sixth
amendment
speak
in
terms
of
proceedings
or
does
it
speak
in
terms
of
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
judge
modified
this
order
and
expressly
said
that
at
the
determination
of
the
trial,
the
transcript
of
the
suppression
hearing
will
be
made
available
to
anyone
who
wants
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
is
there
any
suppression
of
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
you
were
dealing
with
the
trial,
not
pretrial,
weren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nebraska
didn't
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
--
but
if
(inaudible)
as
mr.
justice
stevens
suggested,
if
the
interest
of
justice
and
fairness
require
that
the
jury
not
here
change
of
the
evidence,
how
is
that
purpose
served?
i'm
not
sure
you
quite
fully
answered
and
how
is
that
purpose
served
if
the
jury
hears
it
indirectly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
earlier
mr.
bernius
in
response
to
justice
stevens
that
the
defendants'
right
was
not
paramount.
i
think
those
were
your
words.
you
mean
it's
--
the
defendants'
right
to
a
fair
trial
is
not
paramount?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
--
judge
depasquale
apparently
anticipated
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kobroff.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
these
statistics
very
important?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
yes,
i
mean
i
know
what
it
was
because
i've
seen
the
transcript.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
the
--
it
is
clear
that
this
--
the
gun
was
found
with
greathouse
--
led
the
police
to,
that
was
reported
and
was
reported
that
the
defendants
have
moved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh
yes,
they
had
given
statements
and
written
confessions
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
publication
dealt
with
the
fact
that
new
york
police
were
--
they
listed
--
they
gave
one
statement
that
greathouse
had
made
to
the
michigan
police
when
he
was
captured
that
was
he
was
afraid
he'd
be
shot
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
your
friend
to
say
that
even
though
the
newspaper
reporter
knew
of
it
they
had
not
published
but
it's
just
a
matter
of
their
own
editorial
judgment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
judge
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
judge
put
any
limitation
on
the
prosecutor
or
others
releasing
statements
about
the
confession
or
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
how
the
media
found
out
about
the
adjustments
of
the
gun?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
motions
made
in
open
court
which
was
--
were
there
references
to
the
pistol
in
the
motions
in
open
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
are
public
records
and
they
weren't
sealed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
--
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
transcript
of
the
suppression
hearing
is
now
available
and
is
part
of
the
public
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
its
not
--
it
was
not
sent
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
i
know.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
collateral
but
perhaps
of
some
interest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
fall
within
what
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
once
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag,
it's
impossible
to
get
it
back
in
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
