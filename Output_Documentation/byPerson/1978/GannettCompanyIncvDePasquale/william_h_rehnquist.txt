william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
said
that
this
was
a
separate
proceeding,
you
mean
that
gannett's
proceeding
to
obtain
release
of
or
access
to
the
suppression
motion
was
in
--
under
new
york
law
separate
proceeding
from
the
criminal
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
--
whoa!
counsel,
what
if
the
statistic
show
that
90%
of
the
complaints
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
were
never
even
prosecuted
by
information
or
indictment
by
him,
would
that
make
the
prosecuting
attorney's
conference
among
his
colleagues
part
of
the
trial
because
that
was
the
way
so
many
cases
were
disposed
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
then
that
the
framers
cast
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
saying
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
of
a
public
trial.
why
didn't
they
say
the
press
shall
have
access
to
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
the
framers
shouldn't
have
taken
an
odd
way
of
expressing
it
if
they
meant
to
adopt
your
view.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
can
you
tell
what
the
purposes
served
are
except
by
reading
the
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
were
in
a
federal
court,
you
would
have
some
difficulty
using
change
of
venue
as
an
alternative
if
the
defendant
objected,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
vicinage
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
government
could
have
said
in
--
if
this
case
had
been
pending
in
federal
court,
don't
worry
about
supra
--
the
opening
the
suppression
hearing
to
the
court
because
we're
going
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue
down
to
tennessee.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
geneva
this
county
(inaudible)
of
seneca
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
was
this
court
sitting
in
seneca?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
town?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
in
our
position,
is
it
solely
the
protection
of
the
defendants'
rights
that
is
involved
here,
supposing
the
new
york
legislature
passed
the
law
saying
that
all
trials,
all
criminal
trials
in
the
state
shall
be
closed
unless
otherwise
required
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
and
both
the
defendant
and
the
prosecutor
agreed
in
this
particular
case
that
the
trial
should
be
closed.
they
both
move
forward
or
stipulated
to
it.
is
that
reasoning
a
constitutional
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
rather,
it
would
be
a
rather
strange
statute
but
let's
suppose
it
was
enacted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
constitutional
problems?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
rule
of
an
appellate
court
or
the
rule
of
the
governor
of
new
york
that
his
cabinet
meetings
are
going
to
be
private
or
the
rule
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
his
cabinet
meetings
are
going
to
be
private?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
why
do
you
say
by
definition
of
public
trial
if
the
new
york
state
legislature
says,
it's
not
going
to
be
a
public
trial?
