justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
case
we
have
is
gannett,
it
has
--
the
title
of
this
case
is
gannett?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
criminal
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
proceedings
are
(inaudible)
13
on
your
case.
that's
all
we
have
on
the
proceedings,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
is
there
other
--
any
thing
or
--
of
what
happened
at
the
motion
other
than
what
is
on
the
13?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
gun
is
already
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
also
had
published
that
he
was
on
probation
from
san
antonio.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
state
police
hoping
to
bring
the
pickup
truck
back
and
they're
still
looking
for
the
357
magnum
revolver
which
was
later
found.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
everything
in
there
but
the
confession.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
they
have
other
than
the
confession
they
didn't
have
that
they
published
here.
and
i'm
not
--
but
i'm
just
halfway
through
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
only
thing
then,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
all
the
newspaper
could
publish
would
be
the
record,
the
transcript?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
couldn't
draw
nuances
anything
from
how
the
witnesses
appeared?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
obviuosly
they
weren't
there,
obviously.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
think
that's
necessary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
wouldn't
be
as
good
then,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
two
is
better
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
two
is
better
than
one
is
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
record
plus
the
side
of
the
witness
is
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they're
still
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
how
do
you
explain
why
they
sent
three
reporters
and
didn't
just
wait
for
the
transcript?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
just
want
to
spend
their
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
want
to
waste
their
money.
