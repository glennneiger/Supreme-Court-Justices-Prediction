justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
any
event,
what
the
court
clearly
also
held
was
that
the
district
judge
was
not
permitted
to
find
that
this
was
a
mature
minor
capable
of
--
as
an
equivalent
to
an
adult
so
far
as
being
able
to
decide
his
--
her
best
interest
by
her
own
lights,
and
that
that
was
sufficient,
therefore,
to
approve
the
abortion.
it
had
to
say
that
the
--
your
supreme
judicial
court
held
that
“no,
that's
not
enough
and
that's
not
the
judge's
function.
the
judge's
function
is
to
decide
even
if
this
is
equivalent
to
an
adult
woman
so
far
as
maturity
and
ability
to
make
her
own
decisions
that,
nonetheless,
it's
the
judge's
function
to
decide
in
his
opinion
whether
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
this
person
to
have
the
abortion.”
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
issues
between
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
suggest
it
should've.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
placed
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
as
i
understand
it,
just
to
be
--
i
want
to
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
understand
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
it's
quite
important
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
see
this,
your
supreme
judicial
court
held
that
even
though
the
trial
judge
finds
that
this
particular
minor
is
the
equivalent
of
a
rational
mature
adult
so
far
as
decision
making
goes,
nonetheless,
since
she
is
in
fact
a
minor,
then
the
district
judge,
despite
her
wish
to
have
an
abortion,
can
say
“i
find
it's
in
your
best
interest
not
to.”
justice
potter
stewart
which,
of
course,
he
could
not
do
if
she
were
in
fact
an
adult.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
undoubtedly
true
that
most
adults,
during
the
course
of
their
lifetimes,
make
decisions
which
are
foolish
decisions
but
a
free
society
allows
them
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
and
protects
them
in
doing
so.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
deals
with
the
parents
who
have
left
home,
parents
who
deserted
their
child.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
exception
for
that.
justice
potter
stewart
while
we're
talking
about
what
the
record
shows
as
to
the
facts
of
life,
am
i
correct
in
my
recollection
or
understanding
that
i
read
in
this
brief
that
there
are
cases
on
record
where
girls
as
young
as
five
years
old
can
become
pregnant?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
united
states
of
america?
justice
potter
stewart
are
years
the
same
length
down
there
as
they
are
here?
justice
potter
stewart
against
whom
do
the
criminal
sections
run?
justice
potter
stewart
not
against
the
minor?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
minors
who
have
not
received
the
consent
of
their
parents.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
this
doesn't
talk
anything
about
money.
it's
just
talking
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
consent
of
parents.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
minor
in
massachusetts
is,
for
this
purpose,
is
a
girl,
was
it
18
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
18?
justice
potter
stewart
if
she's
reached
her
18th
birthday,
she's
not
a
minor.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
the
law
makes
all
sorts
of
distinctions
between
married
and
unmarried
people,
minors,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
until
a
person
is
married
and
during
his
or
her
minority,
under
the
ordinary
concepts
of
common
law,
her
parents
speak
for
the
minor.
after
marriage,
that's
no
longer
true
and
that's,
from
time
and
memorial,
been
recognized
by
the
law.
there
are
all
sorts
of
distinctions
made,
depending
upon
that
difference
in
status,
aren't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
respect
to
marriage.
justice
potter
stewart
it
treats
unmarried
minors
differently
from
married
minors
in
many,
many
other
different
ways,
doesn't
it?
