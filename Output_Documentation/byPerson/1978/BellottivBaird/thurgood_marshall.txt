mr.
attorney
general,
how
about
a
young,
below
18,
who
has
left
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
trying
to
find
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
could
--
i
couldn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
come
about
the
child
who
leaves
and
gets
an
apartment
and
lives
by
herself.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
here's
a
child
that's
living
by
itself,
taking
care
of
herself,
and
not
depending
on
anybody.
whose
business
is
it,
except
hers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
seems
a
lot
different
from
the
ordinary
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
be
an
exception,
i
gather.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
she
also
has
to
face
suicide
when
she
gets
over
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we're
going
to
need
them
here
so
they
need
to
go
out
from
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
a
real
question,
is
there
some
people
that
you
and
i
know
that
are
mature
at
17
and
some
who
are
not
mature
at
30?
i
guess
that's
the
answer,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
get
the
volume.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
depends
on
the
wealth
of
the
parents,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think?
and,
i
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
do
you
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
psychiatric
is
free
in
massachusetts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
depending
upon
whether
or
not
a
young
girl
should
have
an
abortion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
free?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
year
is
an
important
factor.
