mr.
garrick
f.
cole
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
garrick
cole.
i'm
an
assistant
attorney
general,
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
and
i'm
here
before
you
today
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth
and
its
district
attorneys,
the
named
defendants
in
this
matter.
the
attorney
general
was
sued
because
he
is
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
in
charge
with
enforcement
of
the
statute.
after
summarizing
briefly
the
prior
proceedings
in
this
case,
reviewing
the
results
of
the
abstention
process
and
stating
the
significant
facts,
i
propose
to
concentrate
my
argument
this
afternoon
on
two
questions:
whether
the
court
should
consider
the
statute
constitutional
on
its
face
and
whether
the
district
court's
remedy,
a
declaration
of
total
unconstitutionality
and
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
any
aspect
of
the
statute
in
the
first
trimester,
the
second
trimester,
and
the
third
trimester
as
to
immature
minors
or
as
to
mature
minors,
whether
the
court
should
consider
that
remedy
appropriate.
we
are
content
to
rely
upon
the
arguments
in
our
briefs
concerning
the
other
issues.
the
district
court's
handling
of
discovery
and
the
matter
of
costs
on
appeal
in
this
court
and
our
prior
appeal.
as
the
court
may
review
from
the
briefs,
this
matter
was
commenced
in
1974
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
before
a
three-judge
district
court
as
a
civil
rights
action
seeking
invalidation
of
a
state
statute.
the
court
had
this
case
before
it
in
jan--
excuse
me,
in
july
of--
for
decision
in
july
of
1976
which
had
vacated
the
district
court's
decision
on
abstention
grounds
and
send
it
back
for
further
proceedings.
those
further
proceedings
occurred
in
1977
and
the
case
was
retried
in
october
of
1977.
in
1978--
in
may
of
1978,
the
district
court
entered
its
decision,
an
order
which
we
seek
review
here
in
this
court
today,
enjoining
the
statute,
as
i've
said,
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
in
its
entirety
and
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
now,
abstention--
the
process
of
abstention
which
this
court
directed
the
district
court
pursue
has
had
a
substantial
impact
on
the
issues
that
are
before
us
today.
as
a
result
of
abstention,
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
now
clear
and
its
purpose
is
certain.
those
purposes,
as
authoritatively
construed
by
our
supreme
judicial
court,
are
to
promote
the
best
interests
of
pregnant
adolescence
and
children
by
stimulating
parental
consultation
accompanied
by
judicial
supervision
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution.
as
a
result
of
abstention,
gone
is
any
suggestion
of
parental
veto.
gone,
also,
is
any
question
concerning
the
promptness
of
judicial
proceedings,
and
gone
is
any
implication
of
improper
or
discriminatory
intent.
the
statute,
we
submit,
that,
as
before
the
court
today,
stands
in
the
long
tradition
of
state
legislation
enacted
to
protect
and
promote
the
best
interests
of
its
minor
citizens.
so,
as
a
re--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
believe
not.
i
believe
that
the
supreme
judicial
court's
opinion
on
this
--
in
this
regard
is
quite
definite,
that
the
judge's
decision
should
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
i
think
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
perhaps
you
might,
your
honor.
i
think
they
may
make
an
argument
that,
well,
i'd
look
them
to
make
that
argument,
whatever
argument
it
may
be.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
well,
let
me
just
suggest
why
i
don't
think
that
means
that
an
answer
to
justice
blackmun's
question
should've
been
different
from
what
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
alright.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
i
think
it's
important,
in
responding
to
your
question,
that
we
realize
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
placed
its
comments
in
that
regard
in
a
context.
and,
it
said
â€œassuming
that
this
requirement
and
this
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
superior
court
judge
is
constitutional,
then
we
believe
that
it
is
constant
with
the
long-established
tradition
of
judicial
supervision
over
the
welfare
of
minors
that
the
court
not
stop
simply
at
a
finding
of
maturity
of
informed
understanding
but,
rather,
look
and
see
whether
there
are
things
which
it
sees
which
the
child
or
adolescent
may
not
see
for
whatever
reason,
make
a
determination
on
that
basis.
so,
i
think
that,
for
that
reason,
the
supreme
judicial
court's
suggestion
as
to
the
judge's
proper
role
is
constant,
once
again,
with
the
tradition
which
we
believe
this
statute
stands.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
share
that
view.
i
don't
think
the
evidence
supports
that
view.
i
think
the
district
court
found,
however,
and
the
expert
testimony
is
that
age
does
bear
relationship
to
the
ability
of
a
child
or
adolescent
to
make
an
informed
decision,
that
the
older
the
child
generally,
more
probable
as
an
individual
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
no,
your
honor,
we're
not.
we're
certainly
not.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
sure.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
sure.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
yes.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
the
judge?
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
she
couldn't
--
he
could
not
do
that
if
she
were
an
adult,
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
suggestion
in
its
opinion
is
that
the
superior
court
judge
should
perform
that
function
if
it's
constitutional
to
do
so.
we
suggest
that,
under
our
analysis
of
the
situation,
that
it
ought
to
be
constitutional
for
the
judge
to
do
that
because
maturity,
in
the
sense
of
informed
understanding,
is
not
always
a
guarantee.
indeed,
i
would
suspect
in
this
area
it's
virtually
no
guarantee
at
all
that
an
adolescent
or
a
child
has
the
life
experience,
has
the
understanding
of
the
abortion
decision
which
a
judge,
who
is
familiar
with
these
problems
perhaps
over
a
period
of
ti
--
sequence
of
cases
may
acquire
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
absolutely.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
other
contexts,
it's
peculiar
circumstances
of
minority
which
sometimes
justify,
indeed
do
justify,
the
states
taking
a
more
protective
role
than
it
otherwise
would
be
permitted
to
do
in
a
case
of
an
adult.
and,
i
believe
that
the
sjc's
suggestion
to
that
regard,
your
honor,
is
consistent
with
this
court's
observation
in
other
contexts.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
well,
the
situation
is
that
--
your
honor
is
referring
to
section
12
(f)
of
the
statute
and
the
answer
is
yes,
as
a
result
of
the
provision,
except
for
the
proposition
that
section
12
(s)
does
not
apply
to
abortions.
so,
the
fact
that
and
i
think
i
should
perhaps
explore
that
point
at
this
point
so
that
you
understand
it,
section
12
(f)
if
a
general,
as
the
supreme
judicial
court
says
in
its
opinion,
legislative
mature
minor
rule,
but
it
applies
only
in
a
very
limited
set
of
circumstances.
it
applies
only
to
those
minors
who
meet
its
six
criteria
and
their
now
criteria,
to
some
degree
they
codify
the
common
law
notion
of
emancipation,
but
they
go
a
little
broader.
but,
they're
still
quite
now
and
section
12
(f)
on
its
face
does
not
apply
as
a
result
to
the
vast
majority
of
children,
male
or
female,
who
live
with
their
families
in
massachusetts.
now,
it's
also
true,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
it
does
not
apply
to
abortion
or
sterilization,
neither
does
section
12
(e)
dealing
with
methadone
maintenance.
the
legislature
has
made
a
determination,
we
suggest
one
which
ought
to
be
within
its
constitutional
power
to
do,
that
some
healthcare
decisions,
maybe
a
lot
of
them,
maybe
ones
which
inf
--
include
very
serious
surgical
procedures
or
other
things
of
that
nature
ought
to
be
within
the
adolescent's
ability
to
decide
for
his
or
herself
and
others
should
not.
and,
abortion,
sterilization,
and
methadone
maintenance
are
three
of
those
legislatively
singled
out
severe
and
controversial
decisions
which
the
legislature
has
determined
an
adolescent
should
--
or
a
a
child
should
not
be
able
to
decide.
as
a
result
of
the
supreme
judicial
court's
ruling,
we
suggest
that
there
are
only
two
questions
of
substantive
quality
before
the
court.
first,
is
the
statute
invalid
simply
because,
i'm
on
its
face
now,
it
requires
parental
consultation
and
notice
in
every
case
--
in
all
cases
and
is
it
invalid
on
its
face
simply
because
it
requires
physicians
who
attend
mature
minors
to
adhere
to
the
same
requirements
which
govern
the
conduct
of
physicians
who
attend
immature
minors?
now,
appreciation
of
the
narrowness
of
these
questions,
it
seems
to
me,
a
narrowness
that
derives
from
the
process
of
abstention,
is
a
helpful
basis
for
turning
to
a
consideration
of
the
facts
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
facts
are
important,
we
believe,
because
they
show
the
tenor
and
complexity
of
the
judgment
which
the
legislature
has
made.
they
are
predominantly
legislative
in
nature,
however,
because
we
are
not
talking
about
a
--
as
applied
attack.
i'm
talking
about
any
individual
minors.
we're
talking
about
the
general
power
of
the
legislature.
skipping
briefly
through
them,
i
want
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
pregnancy
among
adolescence
is
an
increasingly
serious
and
common
phenomenon.
approximately
1
million
adolescence
between
the
ages
of
15
and
19
become
pregnant
each
year,
and
approximately
30,000
adolescence
under
the
age
of
15
become
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
as
to
a
question
that
was
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
as
a
person
to
--
who
has
no
parental
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
yes,
the
statute
deals
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
right.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
well,
there
is
a
s
--
i'm
sorry.
your
question
prompts
my
memory.
in
the
sjc
opinion,
there
is
a
mention,
and
perhaps
my
associate
can
find
it
for
me
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
the
situation
in
which
a
no-substitute
parent
is
available.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
and
the
situation
there
would
be
that,
i
suppose,
that
someone
either
who
could
perform
that
function
would
do
it
for
the
child
or
on
the
child's
behalf
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
right.
well,
your
honor,
in
the
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
yes,
i
agree
with
you.
what
you're
really
talking
about,
i
suppose
in
the
common
law
notion
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
is
the
--
yes,
is
the
emancipated
minor
situation.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
yes,
and
i
see
the
thrust
of
that
argument.
the
legislature's
judgment
is
that
abortion
is
a
terribly
difficult
consideration
and
a
child
who
is
able
to
make
many
other
decisions,
indeed,
virtually
all
of
them
on
their
own
behalf
may
find
herself
totally
at
sea
when
she
faces
this
one.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
if
she
doesn't
do
it,
yes.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
right,
i
understand
your
point,
your
honor,
and
i--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
it's
absolutely
true,
your
honor,
and
we
use
bright
lines,
somewhat
arbitrary
distinctions.
there's
no
question
about
it.
we
face
that
problem.
the
cite,
if
you're
interested,
mr.
justice
marshall,
appears
in
the
northeastern
reporter
on
page
294
to
that
discussion
of
the
--
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
i'm
sorry.
it
is
316
northeaster
2nd
294.
return
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
evidence
establishes
that
abortion
surgery,
although
it
is,
and
from
medical
risk
point
of
view,
relatively
safe,
is
not
without
its
hazards.
and,
the
evidence
indicates
that
complication
rates
vary
from
one-half
of
1%
to
as
much
as
5%
for
abortions
--
excuse
me
--
performed
in
the
first
trimester
by
the
usual
suction
method.
they
are
much
higher
when
one
considers
abortions
performed
in
the
second
semester
by
other
methods.
the
evidence
also
establishes
that
pregnancy
and
abortion
have
serious
psychological
ramifications
for
adolescents
in
particular
and
that
the
problem
of
recidivism.
i
should
define
that
term
in
the
way
that
the
experts
at
trial
used
it,
the
reoccurrence
of
unwanted
pregnancies
among
adolescence
and
children
is
astonishingly
severe.
and,
plaintiffs'
expert
testified
that,
among
her
patients,
the
rate
was
approximately
25%,
that
is
to
say,
one
out
of
every
four
children
whom
she
councils
come
back
again
with
another
unwanted
pregnancy.
and,
the
literature
supports
in
very
--
varying
places
that
the
rates
could
be
as
high
as
95%
in
a
given
sampling.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
it's
in
the
record.
it's
in
the
request
for
admissions.
if
i
can
just
find
that
in
my
notes
here,
i
can
give
you
the
exact
cite.
it's
approximately
request
for
admission
no.
50
or
something
like
that
in
our
request
for
admissions
volume
1
of
the
transcript.
yes,
sir,
that
is
true.
it's
a
case
--
a
reported
case.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
no,
it
was
not.
it
was,
i
believe,
in
peru.
it's
in
a
volume
of
--
we
got
it
from
a
book
on
adolescent
gynecology.
mr.
garrick
f.
cole
your
honor,
it's
an
astonishing
fact,
but
there
are
children
who,
i
believe
she
commenced
menstruating
at
18
months.
i
should
note
in
passing
now,
as
my
time
is
flee
--
flying,
that
we
object
and
continue
to
object
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
in
the
briefs
of
appellees
in
this
case
concerning
the
actual
operation
of
the
massachusetts
superior
court
system.
we
feel
the
--
this
matter,
as
justice
--
judge
aldrich
ruled
at
trial,
was
an
issue
not
relevant
to
a
facial
attack
and,
therefore,
we
do
not
think
that
it's
a
matter
which
the
court
should
properly
consider.
turning
quickly
to
my
argument
on
the
merits,
although
this
is
a
facial
attack
on
a
statute
--
state
statute,
plaintiffs'
claims
and
the
district
court's
opinion
concentrate
on
very
narrow
criticisms.
they
concentrate
upon
the
effect
the
statute
has
on
very
narrow
groups
of
minors.
now,
we
don't
believe
--
we
submit,
this
court's
cases
don't
permit
the
district
court
to
strike
a
state
statute
under
these
circumstances.
starting
from
the
beginning,
parental
consent
and
its
appropriateness,
our
argument
is
that
it's
a
longstanding
tradition
recognized
in
the
law
and
mr.
justice
stevens'
opinions
and
opinions
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
carey
case
note
the
importance
of
parental
counseling,
and
the
parties
all
agree
that
supportive
parental
counseling
is
the
b
--
is
in
the
best
interests
of
minors.
so,
we
start
from
that
proposition.
the
evidence
also
contains
support
that
the--
of
the
importance
of
the
parental
support
in
the
con
--
in
the
minds
of
professionals,
of
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics.
the
court
may
be
aware
from
reading
our
brief
and
looking
at
the
record,
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics
in
1973
had
before
it
the
question
precisely
of
whether
minors,
adolescents,
and
children
should
be
able
to
consent
to
the
performance
of
abortions
and
sterilization
on
their
own
behalf.
and,
the
testimony
and
exhibits
on
file
indicate
that
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics
decide
the
answer
to
that
question
ought
to
be
no.
of
what
then
do
plaintiffs
complain?
placing
aside
the
question
of
the

your
honor,

i'm
going
to
