mr.
john
h.
henn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
john
henn
and
i
represent
the
appellees,
planned
parenthood
league
of
massachusetts
and
others
in
this
case.
the
massachusetts
statute,
section
12
(s),
singles
out
the
unmarried
minor
who
chooses
abortion
for
imposition
of
a
uniquely
burdensome
and
discriminatory
set
of
restrictions.
what
the
state
has
done
is
to
invidiously
classify
into
one
group
all
minors
who
have
never
been
married
and
who
want
an
abortion,
and
into
the
other
group
every
other
kind
of
minor.
now,
these
other
kinds
of
minors
consist
of,
first,
any
minor
who
wants
to
continue
her
pregnancy,
second,
any
minor
who
has
ever
been
married
and
who
wants
an
abortion
and,
third,
any
minor
who
wants
any
kind
of
medical
treatment
however
serious
other
than
abortion.
for
all
these
other
minors,
massachusetts
either
has
no
requirement
of
parental
involvement
at
all
or
has
requirements
which
are
much
less
burdensome
than
those
imposed
by
section
12
(s).
now,
let
me
illustrate
this.
the
case
of
the
minor
who
wants
to
continue
her
pregnancy
is
obviously
the
most
simple.
she
faces
no
requirements
of
parental
involvement
whatever
regardless
of
her
maturity.
the
case
of
the
minor
who
is
or
ever
has
been
married
and
who
wants
an
abortion
is
also
simple.
under
the
massachusetts
emancipated
minor
statute,
section
12(f),
she
is
exempted
from
all
parental
involvement
requirements
regardless
of
her
maturity.
mr.
john
h.
henn
it
is
not,
your
honor.
as
to
the
minor
--
mr.
john
h.
henn
the
were
law
in
massachusetts
law
--
mr.
john
h.
henn
there
are
a
number
of
distinctions
with
respect
to
minority,
obviously
--
mr.
john
h.
henn
and
with
respect
to
marriage,
but
i'm
focusing
now
on
the
medical
treatment
area
and
i
want
to
distinguish
how
uniquely
massachusetts
has
treated
only
the
minor
who
has
the
status
of
being
unmarried
and
who
wants
the
treatment
of
abortion.
let
me
do
that--
mr.
john
h.
henn
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
henn
that
does,
your
honor,
and
emancipation
has
now
been
statutorily
codified
so
that,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
third
case
of
the
minor
who
wants
any
form
of
medical
treatment
whatever
other
than
abortion
from
plastic
surgery
to
amputation,
she
may
obtain
that
in
one
out
of
three
ways,
all
of
which
are
more
liberal
than
what
the
unmarried
minor
wanting
an
abortion
uniquely
faces.
that
minor
who
wants
some
other
medical
treatment
may,
if
she
fits
within
one
of
the
protected
categories
of
the
emancipated
minor
statute,
be
exempted
from
all
parental
involvement
whatever
regardless
of
her
factual
maturity.
even
if
she
does
not
fit
within
the
statute,
she
can,
if
mature,
be
exempted
under
the
common
law
mature
minor
rule
from
all
parental
involvement,
at
least
if
her
doctor
decides
that
parental
notification
is
against
her
best
interest.
and,
finally,
if
she
neither
falls
under
the
statute
nor
under
the
common
law
rule,
she
will
have
to
obtain
the
consent
of
but
one
parent.
in
short
--
mr.
john
h.
henn
in
response
to
that
and
in
response
to
your
earlier
question
to
mr.
balliro
with
respect
to
preservations
of
some
portion
of
the
statute,
we
suggest
the
statute
cannot
be
preserved,
first,
for
the
reason
my
brother
already
mentioned,
namely
that
the
state
court
has
authoritatively
spoken
as
to
the
legislative
intent.
second,
that
it
would
be
unprecedented
for
the
federal
court
to
take
a
statute,
eliminate
its
construction
and,
indeed,
its
text
and
rewrite
it.
and,
third,
you
would
have
here
by
way
of
the
construction
suggested,
distinguishing
between
mature
and
immature
minor,
a
criminal
statute
which
would
make
a
physician's
potential
exposure
to
criminal
liability
turn
on
whether
he
correctly
assessed
maturity
versus
immaturity.
just
as
this
last
month,
this
court
considered
a
statute
where
a
physician
could
or
could
not
be
criminally
liable
depending
on
how
he
assess
the
question
of
viability.
each
of
those
questions
are
questions
in
which
experts
have
differ.
mr.
john
h.
henn
they
do
--
they
do,
your
honor,
but
they
do
only
with
respect
to
exposure
to
a
potential
battery
suit
in
connection
with
an
immature
minor.
the
result
of
the
massachusetts
overall
system
is
that,
for
any
case
you
can
think
of,
except
the
unmarried
minor
wanting
an
abortion,
massachusetts
law
either
leaves
it
up
to
the
minor
and
her
physician
or,
at
most,
requires
one
parent's
consent.
section
12
(s)
stands
in
stark
contrast
in
this
otherwise
liberal
approach.
under
section
12
(s)
and
only
under
that
statute,
an
unmarried
minor
could
actually
be
forced
to
bear
an
unwanted
child.
and,
the
consequence
of
letting
the
statute
go
into
effect,
as
the
facts
found
by
the
district
court
show,
which
have
not
been
challenged
as
clearly
erroneous,
the
consequence
would
be
to
deter
unmarried
minors
from
seeking
legal
abortions,
to
force
some
of
them
to
travel
out
of
state
or
into
the
hands
of
backroom
abortionists,
and
to
force
still
others
to
bear
unwanted
and
usually
illegitimate
children.
mr.
john
h.
henn
it
--
that
is,
in
terms
of
all
of
the
range
of
other
abortion
decisions,
it
is
--
it's
probably
even
irrational
--
mr.
john
h.
henn
we
suggest
that
--
mr.
john
h.
henn
i
think
the
test
would
be
a
test
of
more
heightened
scrutiny,
namely
the
significant
state
interest
test,
but
i
think
it
--
think
it
is
even
irrational
to
single
abortion
out
where
there
is
still
a
system
which
provides
substantially
the
same
kind
of
protection
for
minors
who
at
least
are
incapable
of
making
decisions.
that
is
the
common
law
rule.
it
does
not
say
that
a
minor
incapable
of
consenting
to
abortion
can
nevertheless
get
an
abortion.
the
common
law
rule
is
still
the
common
law
rule
of
battery
which
would
require
one
--
mr.
john
h.
henn
those
cases
--
mr.
john
h.
henn
but,
the
two
common
law
rules,
your
honor.
there's
the
common
--
there's
the
new
mature
minor
common
law
rule.
mr.
john
h.
henn
correct.
mr.
john
h.
henn
correct.
mr.
john
h.
henn
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
henn
that's
--
there,
at
least,
is
no
significant
state
interest
in
that
distinction
because
the
two-parent
consent
rule
here
is
not
only
intermently
burdensome
in
itself,
adding
an
additional
consent
requirement,
but
it
triggers
the
minor's
exposure
to
all
the
other
burdens
of
the
statute.
for
example,
the
discriminatory
burden
of
judicial
veto
where,
in
the
case
other
than
abortion,
a
minor
may
obtain
the
medical
treatment
she
wants
upon
the
concurrent
consents
of
herself,
to
the
extent
of
her
capacity,
one
parent,
and
her
physician.
but,
uniquely
under
this
statute,
a
judge
may
veto
those
concurrent
consents
even
if
the
other
parent
has
not
opposed
the
abortion
in
court
but
merely
declines
to
execute
the
required
consent
form,
and
the
statute
requires
that
a
consent
form
be
executed.
now,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
h.
henn
well,
if
section
12
(s)
were
invalidated,
i
think
--
in
other
words,
if
the
district
court
opinion
in
this
case
were
upheld,
then
i
think
the
physician
would
have
a
good
faith
defense
under
the,
i
believe,
third
paragraph
of
section
12
(f)
which,
in
my
view,
ought
to
apply
which
would
provide
a
good
faith
defense
either
if
he
was
reasonably
mislead
by
the
minor
as
to
her
competence
or
mislead
as
to
her
age.
otherwise,
it
is,
and
indeed
would
be,
the
common
law
rule
as
to
all
medical
procedures
comparing
the
common
law
mature
minor
rule
with
the
more
traditional
common
law
battery
rule
that
a
physician's
judgment,
with
respect
to
maturity,
is
subject
to
exposure,
if
he
errs
and
decides
the
minor
is
mature,
to
a
possible
battery
suit.
i
think
there
should
properly
be
a
good
faith
defense
in
that,
and
i
can't
say
the
common
law
itself
is
clear
in
part
because
the
mature
minor
rule
was
only
announced
in
this
case
by
the
supreme
judicial
court.
now,
the
deterrent
burdens
which
my
brother,
mr.
balliro,
has
discussed
at
some
length
are
ones
which,
in
our
view,
make
this
statute
a
statute
which
is
not
safe
from
the
court's
holding
in
danforth.
the
suggestion
has
been
that
section
12
(s),
its
provision
for
going
to
court
as
an
alternative
somehow
makes
this
case
different
from
danforth.
but,
the
burdens
of
going
into
court
were
found,
as
a
fact,
to
be
severely
detrimental,
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
findings
at
pages
1,001
and
1,002
of
450
(f)
set
in
this
case.
those
findings
were
that
the
burden
of
going
to
court
is
a
“heavy
burden,”
that
the
--
that
an
expert
witness
testified,
credibly
and
without
contradiction,
that
going
into
court
would
be
severely
detrimental
to
the
minor,
testified
that
if
the
minor
--
that
most
minors,
at
least
if
obliged
to
get
parent's
consent
would
not
--
or
many
minors
would
not
go
to
court
but,
instead,
would
seek
illegal
alternatives
and,
quite
importantly,
found
that
if
a
minor
did
go
to
court,
she
was
in
an
impossible
situation.
if
she
prevailed,
that
is,
she
beat
her
parents
in
court,
that
was
hardly
going
to
help
her
family
situation
and,
if
she
lost,
if
her
parents
forced
her
to
bear
an
unwanted
child,
that
was
hardly
going
to
help
her
family
situation
either.
now,
your
honor,
i
would
like
--
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
suggested
state
interest
which
appellants
have
proposed
in
this
case.
the
first
suggested
state
interest
is
that
of
protecting
against
immature
decision
making.
i
submit
this
state
interest
is
already
met
by
existing
massachusetts
law
which
provides
for
physicians
to
make
individual
assessments
of
maturity.
and,
surely,
the
requirement
of
parental
notice
when,
by
hypothesis
against
a
minor's
best
interest,
not
to
mention
judicial
veto
of
a
mature
minor's
decision,
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
protecting
against
immature
decision
making.
indeed,
where
the
state
truly
concerned
to
prevent
immature
decisions,
this
statute
is
obviously
under
inclusive.
it
does
not
impose
any
requirements
even
if
consultation
or
counseling
on
any
minor
who
wants
to
have
a
child,
however
foolish
or
immature
that
wish
may
be.
and,
similarly,
the
statute
sweeps
far
beyond
any
requirement
of
encouraging
parental
consultation.
it
requires
consent
or
notice
of
a
lawsuit
in
every
case
even
if,
by
hypothesis,
harmful
to
the
minor.
an
example
of
a
consultation
statue
is
attached
to
our
brief.
our
brief
is
the
buffed
colored
brief,
as
the
maryland
statute
and,
while
the
factual
workings
of
that
statute
i
can't
speak
to,
that
is
the
--
at
least
an
example
of
the
kind
of
statute
which
would
encourage
consultation
in
the
normal
case,
but
leave
it
up
to
the
physician
to
decide
whether
to
dispense
with
it
in
cases
where
parental
cases
would
be
harmful
to
the
minor.
there
are
no
judicial
proceedings
required
and
the
physician
may
not
be
made
criminally
liable
for
his
decision.
as
to
the
matter
of
remedy,
the
district
court
was
surely
correct
in
invalidating
the
statute
in
its
face.
the
claims
of
all
unmarried
minors
who
wish
abortion
were
before
the
district
court
and
those
are
the
minors
to
whom
the
statute
applies,
there
is
no
as
applied
analysis
therefore,
that
would
be
appropriate
and
this
court
has
not
applied
such
analysis
in
its
review
of
prior
abortion
statutes.
in
summary,
we
submit
that
the
district
court
properly
invalidated
the
entire
statute
as
imposing
undue
burdens
and
unjustified
discriminations
with
respect
to
a
minor's
abortion
choice.
thank
you
very
much.
