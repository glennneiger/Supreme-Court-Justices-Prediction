this
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
bellotti
against
baird
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
cole,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suspect,
for
the
purposes
of
your
case,
you
might
be
willing
to
accept
the
very
emphatic
arguments
that
you've
just
heard
in
the
preceding
case
that
a
16-year-old
is
not
capable
of
making
any
decision
in
f
--
affecting
his
rights
or
her
rights
alone
and
without
advice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
not
arguing
for
any
per
se
rule
in
any
event.

your

it
might
be
in
a
free
clinic,
might
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
have
some
free
clinics
in
massachusetts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
those
free
clinics
supported
by
the
state
of
massachusetts
or
by
private
funding
or
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.

they
have
said
what
the
legislature
provides.
chief

e.

mr.
henn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible,
under
massachusetts
law,
this
statute
or
any
other
where
a
parent
to
compel
the
child
to
submit
to
an
abortion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
very
concept
of
emancipation
does
so,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
henn,
it
may
--
probably
is
not
terribly
important,
but
i
wonder
if
either
in
presentations
to
the
legislature
on
the
arguments
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
there
was
any
--
discretion
of
any
kind
about
the
predicament
of
the
physician
who
performs
the
abortion
after
this
supreme
judicial
court
decision,
assuming
it
is
sustained,
who
is
later
confronted
with
a
malpractice
suit
or
a
battery
suit
by
a
14-year-old
or
15-year-old
girl
after
she's
matured
several
years
later
on
the
grounds
that
she
was
incapable
of
giving
consent
and,
therefore,
it
would
be
a
battery,
in
most
states,
if
there
was
no
adequate
consent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
