justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
any
possible
disagreement
as
to
this
note
between
the
parties?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
as
to
just
what
you
said,
that
the
best
interest
of
the
minors
is
the
rule
under
the
massachusetts
statute.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
the
way
i
read
it,
but
i
wonder
whether
you
knew
as
between
counsel
on
the
opposing
side
of
the
putty
and
whether
there's
any
disagreement
as
to
this.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
i'll
ask
them.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
cole,
just
straighten
me
out.
if
this
mature
minor
were
a
widow,
the
situation
would
be
different,
would
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
the
important
word
in
your
phrasing
of
it
is
“supporting,”
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
am
i
not
correct?
your
statute
requires
it,
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
it
is
supportive.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
riley,
can
i
interrupt
with
one
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
and
your
associate
asking
the
court
to
overrule
danforth?
it
seems
to
me,
all
the
arguments
you've
made
are
really
met
by
that
decision,
aren't
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
asking
the
court
to
overrule
the
danforth
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
have
you
said
anything
that
really
isn't
an
attack
on
that
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
only
difference-
-
there
are
two
differences
that
i
want.
you've
got
two--
you
need
two
parents
here
and
you
only
needed
one
parent
there,
and
you
have
judicial
review
here.
they
are
the
only
differences.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
all
these
other
arguments
fit
that
statute
too,
don't
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bellotti
--
balliro,
have
you
ever
known
of
another
instance
where
your
supreme
judicial
court
has
said,
“this
is
the
way
the
statute
is
construed,
but
if
it
isn't
alright
and
the
federal
court
thinks
it
ought
to
go
another
way,
we'll
go
along
that
way”?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
this
common
in
the
holes
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
harvard
law
professors,
ex-harvard
law
professors
on
that
court
and
i
wondered
if
this
is
what
they're
teaching
these
days.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
henn,
if
these
are
all
equal
protection
arguments,
as
i
understand
it,
the
remedy
for
that
i
suppose
would
be
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
disparity.
in
other
words,
change
it
to
require
one-parent
consent
or,
in
the
case
of
a
mature
minor,
hold
it
invalid
as
to
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
suppose
the
doctors
have
to
make
that
precise
judgment
in
the
non-abortionary
in
the
cases
you
just
described.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
argument
is
that
it's
irrational,
or
close
to
that,
for
the
legislature
to
say
that
the
abortion
decision
is
different
from
these
other
medical
decisions.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
you
are
saying
the
distinction
between
abortions
and
other
medical
procedures
where
only
one
parental
--
consent
of
only
parent
is
required.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
there
is
--
the
legislature
could
not
rationally
consider
one
of
those
decisions
more
serious
than
the
other.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
was
focusing
on
the
cases
outside
the
common
law
rule,
those
where
you
do
not
have
a
mature
minor.
your
objection
there
is
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
you
have
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
let's
take
the
case
of
the
minor
who
is
not
a
mature
minor.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there,
on
the
--
your
argument
is
that,
in
medical
procedures
other
than
abortion,
the
consent
of
one
parent
is
sufficient
and
whereas
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and,
whereas,
consent
of
two
parents
is
required
in
an
abortion
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and,
you're
saying
there
is
no
valid
distinction
between
abortions
and
other
medical
procedures
that
would
justify
a
difference
in
the
kind
of
parental
consent
required.
