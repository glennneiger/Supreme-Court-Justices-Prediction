mr.
brian
a.
riley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
brian
riley
and
i
represent
the
appellant,
jane
hunerwadel,
who
was
permitted
to
intervene
in
the
district
court.
mrs.
hunerwadel
was
the
mother
of
three
unmarried
girls
of
childbearing
age.
at
the
time
this
action
was
commenced,
she
had
no
knowledge
of
the
true
identity
of
mary
moe.
she
was
permitted
to
intervene
on
behalf
of
herself
and
as
representative
of
a
class
of
massachusetts
parents
having
minor
girls
of
childbearing
age
who
might
--
who
are
or
might
become
pregnant
and
choose
not
to
inform
their
parents
as
to
the
nature
of
their
pregnancy
and
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
going
to
seek
an
abortion.
the
intervener
contends
that
the
massachusetts
statute,
as
interpreted
by
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court,
is
constitutional
on
its
face.
the
intervener
contends
that
the
massachusetts
statute
is
constitutional
because
it
reflects
a
long
line
of
decisions
that
this
court,
holding
that
parents
have
the
primary
right,
duty,
and
obligation
to
provide
guidance
and
protection
to
their
minor
children.
this
court
has
only
intervened
--
interfered
with
the
primary
right
and
duty
of
parents
when
the
parents
have
not
acted
in
the
best
interest
of
their
minor
children.
this
court
has
held
that
parents
are
entitled
to
laws
which
aids
them
--
aid
them
in
the
discharge
of
their
obligations.
the
massachusetts
statutes
consistent
with
this
body
of
law,
first,
it
provides
that
the
minor
must
seek
parental
consent
and
guidance
before
she
may
attain
an
abortion.
this
part
of
the
statute
reflects
the
privacy
of
the
family
unit.
however,
it
does
provide
that
a
judge
of
the
superior
court,
an
inbred
mechanism
in
the
statute
may
grant
consent
where
such
consent
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
minor
child.
the
record
demonstrates
the
rationale
for
such
a
statute.
all
of
the
experts
agreed
that,
for
a
minor
girl,
an
unplanned
pregnancy
is
accompanied
by
a
period
of
great
stress.
typically,
these
girls
are
scared,
they're
frightened,
they're
desperate.
one
of
the
experts
described
these
girls
as
upset,
withdrawn,
non-communicative,
and
anxious.
expert
testimony
also
reveals
that
such
girls
are
compelled
to
seek
an
immediate
solution
to
the
problem.
in
short,
they
want
immediate
relief.
and,
yet,
the
experts
state
in
this
case
that
immediate
relief
is
not
proper.
there
ought
to
be
a
period
of
reflection.
this
is
where
the
role
of
the
parents
becomes
critically
important.
all
the
experts
again
agree
that
the
great
majority
of
parents
who
give
support
and
guidance
to
their
children.
they
also
agreed
that
parental
support
and
involvement
is
extremely
important
and
should
be
encouraged
in
every
instance.
it's
important
that
if
the
girl
makes
the
decision
to
have
the
abortion
that
is
the
product
of
reflection
and
thought,
and
not
the
reaction
to
a
crisis.
the
testimony
of
the
intervener,
mrs.
hunerwadel,
demonstrates
the
important
role
the
parents
can
play
in
this
decision.
first,
parents
are
made
aware
of
the
pregnancy
and
they
have
an
opportunity
to
discuss
the
pregnancy
and
the
reasons
and
the
circumstances
that
led
to
it.
that's
a
fundamental
right,
if
a
girl's
daughter
--
if
the
daughter
is
pregnant,
the
parents
ought
to
be
made
aware
of
that.
it
shouldn't
be
kept
secret.
second,
if
the
pregnancy
is
symptomatic
of
other
problems,
whether
they'd
be
emotional
or
not,
affecting
the
girl,
the
parents
can
begin
to
initiate
steps
to
resolve
those
problems.
third,
if
it's
determined
that
the
abortion
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
minor
girl,
the
parents
will
be
given
the
opportunity
to
assist
their
daughter
in
selecting
the
proper
medical
facility
which
best
fits
the
girl's
needs.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
i
think
there
are
many
various
facilities
that
are
available
that
could
be
provided
to
a
minor,
and
some
may
be
more
expensive
or
less
expensive.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
i
think
that
some
doctors
would
be
--
may
charge
a
small
fee
and
provide
a
better
service
than
someone
who
may
charge
a
large
fee
--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
brian
a.
riley
yes,
your
honor,
some
are
free.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
alright,
depending
upon
the
--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
there
are
neighborhood
counseling
services,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
that
are
available,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
--
that
that
--
it's
the
availability
the
parents
have
to
seek
this
type
of
assistance
whether
or
not
that
--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
--
assistance
should
be
available
to
--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
that
is,
your
honor,
but
then,
again,
the
girls,
if
they
need
it,
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
get
it.
now,
whether
or
not
everyone
is
entitled
to
it
is
another
issue
which
i
think
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
case.
the
parents
will
have
the
opportunity
to
ensure
that
the
child
receives
the
best
possible
medical
treatment
by
selecting
the
appropriate
position
and
medical
facility.
by
so
doing,
the
parents
can
ensure
that
the
child
receive
proper
counseling
and
backup
care
in
the
event
of
an
emergency.
finally,
the
parents
can
ensure
that
the
child
receives
proper
post-abortion
counseling
and
psychiatric
care
if
necessary.
a
majority
of
the
district
court
found
that
the
statute's
requirement
of
parental
consultation
is
unconstitutional
because
some
parents
may
be
physically
or
emotionally
unwell.
first
of
all,
the
record
establishes
that
it
is
real
that
a
minor's
fears
about
adverse
parental
reaction
are
in
fact
realized.
it
is
also
common
that
children
have
many
fears
about
adverse
parental
reaction
which
are
plainly
unfounded
and
never
realized
in
fact.
it's
common
knowledge.
second,
that
statute
should
be
--
not
be
judged
on
the
rare
exceptions
to
the
rule
but
should
be
judged
on
the
broad
sweep
of
the
statute's
purpose.
majority
of
the
district
court
questions
the
value
of
giving
parents
a
“last-minute
consultation
with
their
daughter.”
the
majority
seems
to
imply
that
if
parents
have
not
discussed
the
problem
of
the
unplanned
pregnancy,
that
it
would
probably
won't
be
beneficial
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
the
girl
when
it's
time
that
she
may
want
one.
despite
the
obvious
shortcomings
with
this
statement,
it's
found
better
to
give
parents
that
last
opportunity
to
help
their
daughter
and
to
let
them
have
a
last-minute
consultation
possibly
with
a
physician
that
may
only
have
a
narrow
clinical
interest
in
the
abortion
procedure
or
have
solely
a
monetary
interest
in
the
abortion
procedure.
the
facts
of
the
present
case
illustrate
this
point.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
brian
a.
riley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
i
think
that
--
i
believe
i
attempted
to
make
the
point
earlier
that
the
statute,
first,
provides
for
parental
consultation
and,
secondarily,
provides
for
judicial
review
of
that
decision.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
one
of
the
re
--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
one
of
the
reasons
advanced
in
the
--
by
the
district
court
for
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional
was
because
it
required
consultation
in
all
instances,
and
i
don't
think
that
that
was
resolved
in
the
danforth
case.
we're
trying
to
--
attempting
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
why
the
broad
sweep
of
the
statute
is
beneficial
for
the
child.
inbred
in
the
statute
and
consistent
with
previous
cases
of
this
court,
if
the
parents
fail,
if
the
parents
don't
accomplish
what
they
are
under
a
duty
to
perform,
then
the
state
can
move
in
and,
i
think,
once
the
state
moves
in,
they
are
acting
in
the
best
interest
of
the
minor
girl.
never
once
has
this
court
ever
advanced
the
theory
that
the
child
should
become
removed
from
both
the
state,
removed
from
the
family,
and
placed
into
the
hands
of
the
third
party
who
is
in
no
way
responsible
either
legally
by
the
parent-child
relationship,
or
by
the
parens
patriae
relationship
with
the
state
for
the
welfare
of
that
child
in
the
long
run.
and
--
but
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
the
need
that
why
there
should
be
the
intervention
by
the
parents
or
the
court.
in
the
present
case,
dr.
zupnick,
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
resides
in
new
york.
he
travels
to
boston
two
days
a
week
to
perform
abortions,
the
parents
say.
he
receives
anywhere
from
$600
to
$900
for
two
days'
work
in
boston.
he
does
not
participate
in
pre-abortion
decision
making
process.
counseling
is
done
in
groups
by
paraprofessionals.
at
the
time
this
action
was
commenced,
mary
moe
was
16
years
old
and
living
at
home
with
her
parents.
mary
moe
received
an
abortion
by
dr.
zupnick.
her
entire
involvement
with
dr.
zupnick
lasts
five
to
seven
minutes,
the
time
it
took
the
abortion.
had
mary
moe's
parents
been
involved
or
the
court
been
involved,
the
last-minute
consultation
may
very
well,
whether
it'd
be
with
the
parents
or
the
court,
given
rise
to
the
selection
of
a
physician
who
would've
given
her
much
more
thorough
medical
treatment
and
much
more
thorough
pre-abortion
counseling.
mary
moe
was
aborted
on
october
31,
1976.
several
weeks
later,
at
deposition,
she
was
asked
whether
she
had
received
the
required
follow-up
medical
exam.
she
had
not.
two
months
later,
at
the
time
of
trial,
she
was
again
asked
whether
she
had
received
the
required
follow-up
medical
exam.
again,
she
responded
that
she
had
not.
when
asked
why,
she
responded
that
she
want
--
had
to
wait
until
she
received
her
christmas
money
from
her
grandmother
and
her
brother
so
that
she
could
pay
for
the
post-abortion
checkup.
the
intervener
contends
that
the
--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
such
untenable
situation
should
not
be
tolerated
by
the
court.
thank
you.
