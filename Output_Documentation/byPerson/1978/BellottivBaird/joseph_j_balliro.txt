mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
joseph
balliro
and
i
will
address
the
court
with
respect
to
those
issues
involved
in
appellee's
brief
concerned
with
the
undue
burdens
in
the
context
of
the
due
process
argument.
my
colleague,
mr.
henn,
will
address
the
court
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
arguments.
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
say
that
it
should
be
emphasized
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute
that
effectively
prevents,
by
its
sanction,
the
minor
from
obtaining
access
to
abortion
facilities
that
she
may
want
in
order
to
terminate
her
pregnancy.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
the
ones
performing
the
abortion,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
not
against
the
minor.
i
might
point
out
in
response
to
justice
stewart's
question
of
the
penalties
provide
for
fines
between
$100
and
$2,000
and
where
the
maximum
or
any
--
practically,
any
amount
of
those
fines
imposed,
it
would
effectively
preclude
abortion
facilities
being
available
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
minors.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
or
who
don't
have
a
great
deal
of
money.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
no.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
that's
correct.
in
a
long
line
of
--
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
that's
possible
--
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
we
not
only
have
free
clinics,
but
even
clinics
run
by
the
appellees
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
provide,
in
a
very
substantial
percentage
of
cases,
free
services
for
those
who
they're
satisfied
are
indigent.
in
the
record,
appellee
demonstrates
that.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
none
of
them
is
supported
either
by
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
or
by
federal
funding.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
can't
think
off-hand,
your
honor,
of
any
entirely
free
clinic
but,
with
respect
to
the
existing
clinics
that
provide
abortion
services,
almost
all
of
them,
in
one
way
or
another
or
to
some
extent
or
another,
will
afford
indigents
free
services
to
a
greater
degree,
if
your
honor
please,
with
respect
to
the
appellees
in
this
case
and,
more
often
than
not,
other
existing
abortion
facilities
in
massachusetts
will
refer
indigents
to
the
appellee
clinic
in
this
case.
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
beginning
perhaps
back
as
early
as
griswold,
this
court
has
clearly
established
that
the
right
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
is
a
fundamental
right
constitutionally
protected
and
insulated
from
interference
unless
warranted
by
some
compelling
state
interest.
and,
in
bellotti
against
baird,
this
court
recognized
that
the
unmarried
minor
has
a
fundamental
right
to
an
abortion.
now
that
right
cannot
be
unduly
burdened.
now,
when
this
case
first
came
before
this
court,
the
burdens
imposed
by
the
statute
were
somewhat
unclear,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
too
much
difference,
your
honors,
whether
or
not
it
was
unclear
either
because
of
the
representations
that
were
made
concerning
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
at
that
time
by
the
attorney
general's
office
or
whether
they
were
unclear
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
failed
to
abstain,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
now
have
the
benefit
or
the
answers
provided
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
to
some-nine
questions
that
were
certified
to
it.
and,
i
would
suggest
respectfully
that
those
burdens
fall
generally
into
two
categories.
first,
those
required
by
the
necessity
for
two-parent
consent
and
then
those
required
by
what
the
district
court
described
and
which
we
adopt
as
judicial
override.
the
statute
first
requires
that
the
minor
obtained
the
consent
of
both
parents,
and
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
minor
is
mature
and
capable
of
giving
an
informed
consent.
it
makes
no
difference
that
a
physician
may
agree
with
her
or
the
concerned
friends,
adults,
or
otherwise
may
agree
with
her.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
or
not
one
or
both
of
the
parents
have
previously
expressed
views
that
very
strongly
indicate
the
probability
of
aggression
or
hostility
toward
the
child
were
she
ever
to
get
pregnant.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
record
--
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
under
18.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
under
18,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
she's
an
adult.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
record,
with
respect
to
the
appellee
mary
moe,
describes
exactly
that
kind
of
a
hostility
and
aggression
having
been
expressed
by
at
least
one
of
her
parents
or
father
who,
she
testified,
had
indicated
that,
this
was
before
she
was
pregnant,
that
if
she
ever
got
pregnant
he
was
likely
to
kill
her
boyfriend.
it
makes
no
difference
if
the
parents
have
expressed
unalterable
views
that
are
opposed
to
abortion.
even
if
those
use
include
the
forcing
of
her
carrying
to
term
as
punishment
for
whatever
transgression
the
parent
might
feel
the
child
did
by
becoming
pregnant.
and,
it
makes
no
difference
if
the
parents
have
been
separated
for
years
and
one
of
the
other
or
both
have
never
displayed
any
warmth,
any
love,
or
any
affection
for
the
child.
the
only
exception
to
that,
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
is
with
respect
to
the
legal
definition
of
desertion,
whether
or
not
one
of
the
parents
deserted
the
other
parent.
and,
it
makes
no
difference,
may
it
please
the
court,
if
the
most
renowned
physician
or
group
of
physicians
or
psychiatrists
were
to
attest
to
irreparable
or
long-lasting
harm
to
the
minor
if
forced
unreasonably
or
arbitrarily
or
against
her
will
to
have
an
abortion.
and,
according
to
the
statute
as
it's
written
in
the
face
of
that
kind
of
overwhelming
interest
as
to
what
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child,
even
a
dispassionate
judge
could
not
order
that
that
abortion
proceed
without
notification
and
consultation
of
the
parent--
parents,
both
of
them.
in
short,
this
statute
that
talks
in
terms
of
a
good
cause
and
the
statute
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
discussed
in
terms
of
both
the
court
and
parents
conducting
themselves
in
a
manner
that
would
be
to
the
best
interest
of
the
child
would
compel
notification,
consultation,
and
the
obtaining
of
consent
of
both
parents
in
total
disregard
of
what
every
thinking
person
in
a
significant
number
of
cases,
i
submit,
would
agree
was
totally
irrational
and
dangerly
harm--
dangerously
harmful
both
to
the
child
herself
and
very
well
to
her
parents,
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
because
that
judge
would
be
forced
to
direct
that
notification
of
that
pregnancy
be
made
to
parents
even
though,
for
example,
one
of
them
may
be
suffering
from
a
very
severe
hot
condition
that
could
very
well
be
triggered
into
something
a
lot
more
serious
where
that
parent
would
find
out
that
its
child
was
pregnant.
as
far
back
as
roe
against
wade,
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
carey
against
population
services,
this
court
has
spoken
in
terms
of
the
necessity
of
there
being
a
compelling
state
interest
as
necessary
to
justify
regulation
of
a
right
so
fundamental
as
to
whether
to
bear
a
child
in
that,
more
importantly,
any
such
regulation
be
narrowly
drawn.
far
from
being
narrowly
drawn,
we
suggest
that,
obviously,
the
two-parent
consent
requirement
of
this
statute
is
about
as
broadly
drawn
as
any
statute
could
be.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
i
believe
that
it
is
and
i
would
adopt
the
district
court
finding
that
respect.
and,
more
particularly,
it's
description
of
the
supreme
judicial
court's
method
of
saving
a
part
or
major
part
of
the
constitution
of
this
statute
by
its
chameleon
change
of
color
to
satisfy
whatever
this
court
might
feel
is
necessary
in
order
for
any
part
of
it
to
survive
constitutionally
is
not
a
view
of
severability
that
i
can
adopt.
i
would
adopt
the
district
court's
view,
justice
stevens,
with
respect
to
--
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
you
wouldn't
be
doing
justice
to
the
legislature
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
i
think
if
you
did
that,
you
would
then
wind
up
with
a
statute
that
was
directly
contrary
to
what
the
expressed
view
of
the
legislature
of
the
commonwealth
was,
that
there'd
be
a
two-parent
consent.
and,
i
don't
think
that
it
should
be
the
function
of
the
federal
court
to
make
that
kind
of
a
distortion.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
that's
what
the
supreme
judicial
courts
held
--
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
--
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
that's
correct,
but
that's
not
the
legislature
of
--
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
well,
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
chief
justice,
perhaps
the
greatest
difficulty
i
have
with
severing
out
that
portion
of
the
legislature
--
legislative
requirement
is
in
my
strong
feeling
that,
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
statute,
in
almost
every
aspect
it's
so
unduly
burdens
that
it
would
not
survive
if
that
were
to
be
done
anyway.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
but,
it's
my
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
your
honor,
it's
not
only
uncommon
in
massachusetts
and
nor
do
i
know
of
any
other
instance
in
--
with
respect
to
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
where
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
ever
spoken
in
that
sense,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
other
decision,
at
least
i've
never
been
acquainted
with
one
in
which
--
mr.
joseph
j.
balliro
i
don't
think
they
teach
that
at
harvard,
if
your
honor
pleases.
conceding
the
uncontradicted
fact
that
parental
guidance
is
desirable,
nonetheless,
the
also
unconstradicted
fact
in
this
record
is
that
an
appreciable
number
of
--
in
an
appreciable
number
of
cases,
the
requirement
of
obtaining
parental
consent
of
both
parents
will
lead
to
a
disaster
either
for
the
child,
the
parents,
or
both.
and,
i
note,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
my
time
is
up.
