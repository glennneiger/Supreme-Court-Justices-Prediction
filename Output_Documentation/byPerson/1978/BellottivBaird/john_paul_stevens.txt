mr.
balliro,
just
to
use
that
as
an
example,
as
i
remember
the
supreme
judicial
court's
comments
on
the
case,
they
suggested
that
if
the
statute
were
too
broadly
construed,
the
federal
court
might
sustain
its
constitutionally
on
--
constitutionality
only
in
part
rather
than
taking
it
as
a
whole.
what
would
be
wrong
with
the
view
that
the
court
should've
simply
held
the
two-parent
consent
requirement
unconstitutional
but
sus
--
or
maybe
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
mature
minor,
but
that
the
statute
should
be
saved
with
respect
to
the
immature
minor
where
in
--
at
least
in
case
where
the
consent
of
one
parent
might
well
be
supportive
or
at
least
consultation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
necessary
to
examine
the
whole
thing
on
a
facial
basis,
in
other
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
sure
you
would,
but
do
you
want
to
try
and
persuade
us
why
we
should
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
highest
court
of
the
state
has
said
that
if
we
can't
have
the
total
picture
that's
been
presented,
we
want
as
much
of
it
as
can
possibly
be
saved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
highest
court
of
massachusetts.
