just
before
you
go
back
just
a
moment,
mr.
wallace,
why
do
you
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
the
constitutional
question
if
you
found
that
what
the
commission
did
was
not
authorized
by
the
act?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
there
--
did
they
indicate
in
your
view
that
their
statutory
holding
was
influenced
by
their
constitutional
views
sometimes
you
know.
justice
potter
stewart
and
because
of
constitutional
difficulties
one
feels
impelled
of
construe
a
statute
to
certain
way?
