justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
difficult
to
describe
that
as
a
holding,
is
it
not,
in
view
of
the
fact
of
the
chief
justice's
concurrence
in
the
result?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
reasoning
for
upholding,
i
mean
it
cannot
really
be
attributed
to
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
are
saying
that
the
mandatory
access
was
necessary
to
the
decision
of
the
court
in
southwest
cable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
did
you
think
in
this
case
these
rules
you
are
describing
that
the
commission
is
imposed
on
cable
telecasters
would
be
permissible
for
it
to
impose
on
broadcasters?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
could
not
the
commission
just
say
you
broadcast
for
ten
hours
a
day
and
let
other
people
broadcast
it
for
four
hours
a
day?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
congress
could
impose
these
rules
on
newspapers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro
perhaps
my
colleagues
don't
cheer
my
ignorance
of
cable
television,
but
what
is
involved
in
activating
a
new
channel
for
the
cable
tv
operator?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
goals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
those
goals
specified
anywhere
in
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
read
the
plurality
in
midwest
i
as
authorizing
the
commission
to
simply
set
goals
quite
apart
from
the
statutory
framework.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
first
amendment
gave
it
rather
than
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
have
thought
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
had
given
it
to
them
rather
than
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
public
easements,
do
you
mean
the
easements
own
by
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
call
that
as
a
public
resource?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
you
spoke
quite
glowingly
on
two
occasions
in
your
response
of
the
chief
justice's
concurrence
in
midwest
video.
in
his
opinion
in
columbia
broadcasting
versus
democratic
committee
at
page
107
of
412,
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
in
the
act
of
1934,
congress
rejected
a
proposal
that
would
have
imposed
a
limited
obligation
on
broadcasters
to
turn
over
their
microphones
to
persons
wishing
to
speak
out
on
certain
public
issues.
if
that
cannot
be
required
of
broadcast,
do
you
think
it
can
nonetheless
be
required
of
cable
broadcasters
by
the
commission?
