mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
statutory
and
constitutional
challenges
under
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
to
three
related
sets
of
rules
of
the
federal
communications
commission
relating
to
the
cable
television
requiring
certain
defined
cable
systems
in
one
rule
to
have
the
capacity
by
1986
to
provide
at
least
20
channels
of
service
to
their
subscribers,
in
another
rule
to
provide
access
to
certain
of
those
channels
if
demand
exists
access
to
third
parties
and
if
there
is
sufficient
activated
channel
capacity
and
in
the
third
set
of
rules
to
have
available
and
make
available
certain
equipment
and
facilities
to
those
parties
for
those
purposes.
i
will
summarize
briefly
the
rules
and
then
discuss
later
pertinent
details
as
they
relate
to
portions
of
the
argument.
the
channel
capacity
rules
are
really
adequately
summarizing
what
i
said
already
that
by
1986,
20
channels
should
be
available
to
their
subscribers.
the
access
rules
apply
to
four
categories
of
third
parties
who
will
have
access
to
the
extent
there
is
available
capacity
for
their
access.
the
public,
educational
authorities,
local
governments
and
paying
leasors
for
those
systems
that
were
already
in
operation
by
june
21,
1976.
there
is
basically
no
obligation
to
bump
any
established
programming
other
than
automated
time
and
weather
service,
which
is
a
sort
of
ticker
tape
kind
of
informational
programming,
for
systems
constructed
thereafter
or
for
new
capacity
that's
added
to
existing
systems
there
is
requirement
that
at
least
one
channel
be
available
for
access
by
these
groups,
but
to
the
extent
that
demand
doesn't
require
more
than
one
channel
it
can
be
a
composite
channel
for
access.
the
third
category
of
rules
the
equipment
availability
rules
are
basically
designed
to
see
to
whether
the
equipment
is
there
so
that
the
people
with
the
access
rights
will
have
some
way
of
coming
into
the
studio
and
having
their
programming
broadcast.
the
court
of
appeals
treated
the
rules
together
rather
than
separately
and
struck
down
all
of
them
under
the
act,
but
also
expressed
the
view
quite
firmly
that
the
rules
would
in
any
event
violate
the
constitution.
so
then
in
our
view
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
contentions
that
the
rules
are
authorized
by
the
act,
it
should
go
ahead
and
address
the
constitutional
issues
since
a
remand,
the
result
of
a
remand
will
be
foreordained
in
the
case
and
it
is
--
the
statutory
question
should
not
really
be
considered
in
isolation
in
the
constitutional
contentions
in
any
event.
now
more
than
10
years
ago
in
united
states
against
southwestern
cable
company,
this
court
established
that
section
2
(a)
of
the
communications
act
does
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
commission
over
cable
television.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
judge
webster
pointed
out
in
this
concurring
opinion
there
was
no
need
to
do
so
but
two
of
the
judges
choose
to
do
so
and
the
questions
were
argued
to
the
court
and
perhaps
it
was
to
make
clear
what
would
happen
if
this
court
should
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
statutory
issue
as
it
did
in
the
last
midwest
video
case
disagreed
with
the
same
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
the
commission's
statutory
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
refrain
from
calling
it
an
alternative
holding
but
they
made
quite
clear
their
view
that
the
rules
would
violate
the
first
amendment
and
suggested
strongly
that
they
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
as
well.
they
did
refrain
from
stating
explicitly
it
was
an
alternative
holding
in
fact
they
stated
that
their
holding
was
based
entirely
on
the
statutory
ground.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
really
hard
for
me
to
answer
that
question
i
don't
think
the
opinion
is
all
that
clear
on
the
extent
to
which
the
constitutional
view
influenced
the
statutory
holding.
i
can't
really
speak
for
the
court
on
that.
in
any
event
the
southwestern
case
thus
established
the
basic
statutory
authority
on
the
face
of
the
act
at
least
so
long
as
the
regulations
adopted
by
the
commission
are
as
this
court
put
it
reasonably
ancillary
to
its
jurisdiction
over
broadcasting.
then
almost
seven
years
ago
now,
in
what
we
refer
to
as
midwest
video
i
in
the
briefs,
this
court
held
that,
that
statutory
authority
extends
to
rules
requiring
cable
systems
and
to
put
the
holding
in
somewhat
generic
terms
used
by
the
plurality
opinion
to
rules
requiring
the
systems
affirmatively
to
promote
the
statutory
policies
of
the
act
such
as
increasing
outlets
for
community
expression
and
providing
more
programming
choices
for
the
public.
now
to
a
large
extent
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
but
there
was
a
judgment
of
the
court,
there
was
a
holding
that
those
rules
were
valid.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
understand,
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
no
disagreement
in
any
of
the
opinions
with
that
proposition
and
this
is
i
think
an
accurate,
generic
categorization
of
the
rules
that
were
issued
before
the
court
and
it
was
the
commission's
own
description
of
the
rules
on
the
basis
for
its
authority.
now
i
grant
that
there
is
no
opinion
of
the
court
and
we
are
quite
aware
of
that.
nonetheless
in
midwest
video
i,
the
court
had
before
it
many
similar
questions
to
the
statutory
questions
that
are
now
before
the
court.
the
rules
there
did
have
an
equipment
availability
component
that
really
is
basically
the
same
as
the
present
equipment
availability
rule.
it
was
put
there
as
part
of
the
--
and
it
is
referred
to
explicitly
by
the
court.
it
was
part
of
the
origination
of
the
programming
requirement
and
the
court
was
ruling
against
the
background
of
the
rules
that
had
been
involved
in
the
southwestern
cable
company
case
in
which
a
plurality
of
the
court
against
said
had
been
correctly
upheld
subsequently
by
several
courts
of
appeals
namely
rules
that
required
certain
signal
carriage,
mandatory
access
if
you
want
to
use
that
word,
mandatory
carriage
is
usually
used
in
that
context,
of
local
television
programmings
by
the
cable
systems.
we
are
talking
the
access
component
in
the
sense
that
mandatory
carriage
is
something
that's
been
familiar
since
the
beginning,
since
the
outset
of
the
commission's
regulation
of
cable
television
and
was
precisely
what
was
before
the
court
in
southwestern
cable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
the
court
merely
held
that
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
to
promulgate
rules
on
this
subject.
it
did
not
uphold
the
validity
of
the
rules,
but
subsequent
court
of
appeals
decisions
did
and
four
justices
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
midwest
video
said
that
those
cases
were
correctly
decided.
that
was
and
still,
you
know
that
regulation
still
exists,
but
that
was
the
beginning
of
commission
regulation
more
than
ten
years
ago
now.
in
1966
of
cable
television
it
was
to
require
that
local
broadcast
programs
be
carried
on
the
cable
and
to
prohibit
duplication
of
network
programming
carried
by
local
stations
from
distant
signal
stations.
that
was
that
the
first
thing
that
the
commission
did
in
this
field
was
to
prescribe
certain
carriage
requirements.
now
it
wasn't
accessed
by
the
public,
it
was
accessed
by
broadcasters,
but
the
word
access
is
not
inappropriate
in
this
context.
moreover
it
was
quite
clear
to
this
court
in
midwest
video
i
that
the
origination
requirement
and
the
equipment
availability
requirements
before
the
court
at
that
time
were
tied
in
with
rules
than
being
developed
and
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
commission
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
midwest
video
that
would
grant
rights
of
access
to
this
equipment.
and
they
also
adopted
channel
capacity
rules
along
with
those
prior
to
this
court's
decision.
all
of
that
was
made
quite
clear
to
the
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
discussions
during
the
argument
in
that
case
were
of
that
kind
of
programming
that
was
foreseen
and
there
is
several
references
in
the
plurality
opinion
backgrounding
these
rules
which
make
this
quite
clear
on
page
653
of
volume
406
us
in
footnote
5,
the
plurality
opinion
quotes
the
commission
as
saying
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
origination
requirement
is
to
ensure
that
cable
casting
equipment
will
be
available
for
use
by
others
originating
on
common
carrier
channels.
on
the
next
page,
page
654
there
is
also
a
quotation
with
approval
from
tentative
conclusions
of
earlier
notice
of
rule
making
that
these
the
proposed
rules
also
reflect
our
view,
this
is
quoting
the
commission
that
a
multi-purpose
catv
operation
combining
carriage
of
broadcast
signals
with
program
origination
and
common
carrier
services
might
best
exploit
cable
channel
capacity
to
the
advantage
of
the
public
and
promote
the
basic
purpose
for
which
this
commission
was
created.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
suggested
in
the
democratic
national
committee
case,
cbs
against
the
democratic
national
committee
that
narrowly
defined
access
requirements
might
be
valid
in
broadcasting.
there
is
no
practical
way
that
these
rules
could
be
imposed
on
broadcasting
because
of
the
different
physical
constrains
that
are
involved.
a
cable
caster
has
simultaneous
cables
running
to
its
subscribers
and
can
do
his
own
programming
on
the
great
majority
of
them
while
still
complying
with
these
rules
whereas
the
broadcaster
only
has
the
one
frequency
assigned
to
him
into
the
extent
that
he
is
required
to
permit
anyone
else
to
have
the
access
to
it,
he
relinquishes
his
opportunity
to
broadcast
it
all
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
be
an
analogous
requirement,
but
it
wouldn't
be
the
same
requirement.
you
are
asking
me
if
they
could
impose
the
same
requirement
and
my
answer
was
that
it
couldn't
practically
be
done,
it
couldn't
be
done
as
a
practical
matter.
it
would
have
to
be
a
requirement
adapted
to
the
special
physical
situation
of
broadcasters
and
the
commission
has
been
concerned
about
the
fact
that
it
requires
interruption
of
the
broadcaster's
right
to
be
on
the
air
at
all
if
such
a
requirement
is
imposed.
in
contrast
what
was
adopted
here
which
was
basically
a
requirement
that
unused
capacity
be
put
to
this
kind
of
community
use
and
that
in
rebuilding
that
would
normally
take
place
during
the
next
ten-year
period,
a
new
building
sufficient
capacity
to
be
built-in
so
that
there
would
be
basically
this
kind
of
access
capacity.
granted
a
cable
television
operator
might
argue
that
he
would
prefer
to
put
it
to
some
different
use
at
sometime
in
the
future
but
we
are
not
talking
about
disruption
of
established
programming
services
or
established
pay
services.
we
are
talking
about
using
this
technology
for
new
additional
opportunities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
rule
applies
but
with
the
qualifications
that
i
mentioned
that
no
established
programming
is
to
be
bumped
under
this
rule,
no
established
programming
in
effect
on
june
21,
1976
other
than
automated
time
and
weather
programming.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right
unless
they
want
to
build
in
additional
capacity.
they
could
build
in
60
or
80
channels
if
they
wanted
to
and
provide
converters
to
their
subscribers
and
the
rule
would
not
require
any
more
of
it
to
be
devoted
to
access
than
if
they
have
a
20
channel
system.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there
is
a
similarity
in
the
constitutional
argument
being
made
here.
there
are
familiar
rules,
the
prime
time
rule
is
a
good
example
in
which
licensees
and
those
authorized
to
use
the
broadcast
signal
are
required
to
adjust
the
categories
of
programming
that
they
can
carry
and
in
some
cases
to
provide
access
broadcasters
for
example
there
is
the
personal
attack
rule,
they
have
to
provide
access
for
response
to
personal
attacks.
there
is
also
a
statutory
requirement
that
candidates
for
political
office
be
allowed
broadcast
time.
so
that
the
generic
category
of
regulation
is
a
familiar
one
yes
and
in
many
respects
the
category
of
regulation
which
was
upheld
unanimously
by
the
court
in
the
red
lion
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
i
think
that's
very
dubious
theory.
there
is
a
way
of
arguing
a
distinction
of
the
miami
herald
against
tornillo
case
because
the
obligations
here
are
unrelated
to
the
content
of
anything
previously
published
which
was
not
true
in
the
tornillo
case.
there
the
obligations
came
into
effect
only
because
of
what
the
newspaper
had
published
and
the
court
expressed
solicitude
for
the
chilling
effect
on
such
discussion
by
the
newspaper
that
the
rules
might
entail.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
of
course
i
think
basically
that's
the
difference.
if
one
might
move
to
the
first
amendment
question
here
which
is
really
what's
been
raised
i
think
the
whole
contention
of
the
respondent
here
about
journalistic
discretion
is
really
quite
overdrawn
when
you
look
at
the
kind
of
enterprise
we
are
talking
about
here.
basically
it's
an
enterprise
that
is
carrying
and
retransmitting
the
product
of
others
without
even
the
opportunity
for
the
kind
of
editing
that
a
newspaper
can
do
when
it
uses
wire-service
stories.
it's
just
retransmitted
as
a
package,
that's
their
basic
enterprise
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
midwest
video
i
described
their
enterprise
as
having
no
more
content
over
what
is
transmitted
on
the
wire
than
does
a
telephone
company
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
they
do
have
some
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
there
is
editorial
judgment
and
we
do
not
contend
that
they
do
not
have
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
wasn't
my
analogy
and
we
don't
rely
on
it,
[attempt
to
laughter]
no
but
there
are
similarities
to
the
telephone
company
and
similarities
to
broadcasters,
similarities
to
the
print
medias,
similarities
to
common
carriers
and
to
other
public
utility
companies
all
of
which
we
argue
in
our
brief
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
looking
at
the
first
amendment
contention
and
in
addition
to
this
basic
point
about
the
nature
of
the
enterprise
the
familiar
signal
carriage
requirements
that
i
talked
about
before
show
that
there
has
never
been
in
this
field,
a
promise
of
unfettered
editorial
judgment
about
what
can
or
must
be
carried
among
the
programming
offered,
there
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
regulation
says
that
the
cable
company
should
adopt
procedures,
rules
for
itself
to
show
how
it
will
handle
request
on
first
come
first
serve
basis,
so
this
anticipates
that
people
don't
have
to
be
given
the
particular
time
slot
that
they
request
that
scheduling
can
be
done
to
use
the
capacity
that
blackout
time
can
be
used
on
other
channels
when
time
is
available
and
so
forth
and
if
the
domain
gets
large
enough
and
there
is
available
a
second
channels
and
that
two
should
be
made
available
up
to
four
channels
if
they
are
available,
but
the
experience
so
far
has
been
that
a
composite
channel
pretty
much
is
able
to
cover
it.
there
are
as
the
commission
indicated,
quite
explicitly
in
these
rules,
the
details
to
the
worked
out
refinements
to
be
made.
this
is
a
very
dynamic
field.
the
commission
has
been
giving
its
sustained
attention
now
for
more
than
10
years
has
changed
direction
considerably
since
the
last
time
we
were
in
this
court
with
respect
to
cable
rules.
it
gave
up
the
origination
requirement
in
response
to
commentaries
and
experience.
it
concluded
that,
that
would
be
unduly
burdensome
on
systems
that
did
not
want
to
themselves
undertake
to
originate
programming
and
is
really
using
the
access
requirement
largely
as
a
substitution
to
serve
the
same
kinds
of
community
purposes
and
needs
that
the
origination
requirement
was
designed
for
and
its
cutback
a
great
deal
on
the
timetable
for
the
channel
capacity,
your
requirements
and
on
the
extent
to
which
channels
have
to
be
made
available
for
access.
the
basic
differences
between
the
rules
that
existed
in
1972
at
the
time
of
midwest
i,
not
all
of
which
were
before
the
court,
and
the
present
rules
is
that
the
burdens
on
the
cable
systems
have
been
alleviated.
the
changes
basically
were
designed
to
alleviate
burdens
that
were
imposed
and
the
main
burden
that
was
imposed
was
the
origination
rule
and
it
was
the
burden
of
having
to
become
a
programmer
and
to
produce
your
own
programming
which
these
people
had
not
necessarily
undertaken
to
do
in
setting
up
what
basically
started
as
community
antennae
television
systems
that
the
four
dissenting
justices
in
midwest
i
found
objectionable
in
that
case
and
found
to
extend
beyond
the
commissions
proper
regulatory
authority
to
commandeer
someone
who
had
undertaken
merely
to
carry
the
products
of
others
into
producing
his
own
products
and
transmitting
them.
and
the
commission's
new
rules
really
need
that
objection
by
coming
back
for
those
who
choose
not
to
get
into
the
business
of
producing
their
own
programs
just
to
stay
with
their
familiar
business
of
carrying
the
products
of
others.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
aware
of
them
if
they
do,
but
i
have
not
heard
that
they
do
but
i
can't
inform
you
of
their
content.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
these
rules
apply
only
to
cable
systems
that
are
using
a
public
resource
namely
television
broadcast
signals.
on
their
face,
the
rules
start
off
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
they
have
been
treated
as
such
in
the
history
of
regulation
under
the
communications
act.
even
if
one
would
quarrel
with
the
terminology,
the
factual
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
rules
apply
only
to
cable
systems
which
retransmit
television
broadcast
signals
so
that
basically
what
the
chief
justice
had
to
say
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
midwest
video
i
applies
when
he
said,
it
has
been
elaborated
more
by
himself
in
prior
opinions
and
by
others,
but
he
said
the
essence
of
the
matter
is
that
when
they,
the
cable
systems
interrupt
the
signal,
it
is
a
broadcast
signal
and
put
it
to
their
own
use
for
profit.
they
take
on
burdens,
one
of
which
is
regulation
by
the
commission
to
serve
the
public
interest
goals
that
are
specified
in
the
communications
act
and
that
are
the
very
same
goals
that
were
involved
in
the
rules
that
were
upheld
by
the
court's
judgment
in
midwest
i.
there
is
no
difference
in
the
goals
being
served
by
the
rules.
there
are
substitute
for
those
rules.
yes?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
there
would
be
because
even
in
the
instances
of
other
kinds
of
programming
that
mr.
shapiro
referred
to,
programming
beamed
in
from
satellites,
those
are
beamed
on
microwave
transmissions
that
are
regulated
under
title
ii
of
the
communications
act.
there
is
a
use
of
signals
there.
it's
not
signals
from
the
television
broadcast
spectrum,
but
they
are
signals
from
the
public
airwaves
that
are
regulated
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
medium
that
is
divorced
in
important
aspects
of
its
activities
from
the
radio
spectrum.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
a
section
3
(h)
which
appears
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
the
commission's
petition
on
page
210.
it
is
section
153
(h)
of
title
47
and
you
will
notice
that
all
that
is
there,
when
you
read
it
in
context,
is
the
definition
section
of
the
act
defining
who
is
a
common
carrier
and
it's
by
way
of
a
caveat
that
just
because
someone
engages
in
radio
broadcasting
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
is
a
common
carrier
subject
to
all
of
the
filing
regulations
and
dedicating
all
of
his
facilities
to
common
carriage
in
the
rest
of
it
that
otherwise
would
follow
from
this
definition,
even
if
he
did
allow
some
others
to
use
his
facilities.
now
to
the
extent
that
this
expresses
a
policy
that
the
commission
is
to
follow
and
that
means
that
it
utilizes
in
conducting
its
other
regulatory
activities,
it
certainly
is
far
from
an
absolute
prohibition.
it
is
merely
something
to
be
taken
into
account
along
with
other
policies
expressed
in
the
act
and
it
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
suggestion
made
in
this
court's
opinion
in
cbs
against
democratic
national
committee
that
limited
kinds
of
access
obligations
are
consistent
with
the
communications
act
and
might
be
imposed
on
broadcasting
if
they
were
carefully
drawn
and
concluded
to
be
in
the
public
interest
by
the
commission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
an
example
and
certainly
there
is
no
further
limitation
on
cable
television
which
is
not
even
referred
to
in
this
section
153
(h).
now,
finally
i
would
like
to
say
that
congress
has
been
very
aware
of
the
commission's
activities
in
this
area
in
recent
years.
as
i
say
the
commission
has
been
making
a
ten-year
sustained
effort
not
only
as
this
reported
regularly
to
congress
in
annual
reports
and
appropriations,
hearings
and
the
likes,
but
there
has
been
recent
legislative
activity
in
congress
which
shows
a
continuing
awareness
of
it.
we
have
cited
on
page
34
of
our
brief
in
a
footnote,
a
recent
public
law
which
specifically
refers
to
cable
operators
those
over
whom
the
commission
has
continuing
jurisdiction
and
the
law
actually
says
that
the
forfeiture
penalties
of
the
act
to
be
applied
not
only
for
failure
to
comply
with
licenses
as
we
quote
there
but
also
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
rules
and
the
senate
committee
report
which
is
report
number
95-580
of
the
95th
congress
first
session
refers
to
this
court's
decisions
in
southwestern
cable
and
midwest
1,
so
that
the
admonitions
of
the
chief
justice's
concurring
opinion
that
congress
has
been
relying
and
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
commission's
activities
in
this
field
and
can
be
counted
on
step
in
if
it
disagrees
with
what
the
commission
is
doing
in
its
responses
to
the
changing
dynamics
of
this
industry
and
as
it
gains
experience
in
this
filed
are
even
more
pertinent
here
after
seven
more
years
of
experience
and
adjustment
by
the
commission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
not
concede
that
it
cannot
be
required
of
broadcasters
because
the
very
same
opinion
points
out
that
limited
access
rules
might
be
properly
required
of
broadcasters
notwithstanding
that
can
be
drawn
from
failure
of
congress
to
enact
an
exclusive
requirement,
congress
nevertheless
gave
the
commission
authority
to
further
public
interest
goals.
the
congress
specified
in
ways
that
should
seem
appropriate
as
experience
with
the
industry
develops
and
as
needs
become
apparent
that
congress
was
not
at
that
point
willing
to
anticipate.
i
do
not
think
that
anymore
than
that
opinion
internally
indicates
that
the
mere
facts
of
that
provision
was
not
adopted
at
the
outset
meant
that
the
commission
is
without
authority
because
the
opinion
says
the
contrary.
