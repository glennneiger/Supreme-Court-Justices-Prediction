mr.
wallace,
could
i
ask
you,
are
there
–
does
the
commission
have
rules
of
perspective
to
the
acquisition
or
ownership
of
cable
systems
by
broadcasters
or
by
the
networks?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
shapiro,
could
you
at
some
point
answer
that
question
i
just
asked?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
in
other
markets?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
a
broadcaster
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
unregulated
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
don't
originate,
neither
does
a
broadcaster?
they
just
hire
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
prepare
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
was
connected
with
the
broadcast?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
a
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
then
what
you
are
saying
now
you
don't
think
is
inconsistent
with
what
you
said
--
the
way
you
answered
the
chief
justice
with
respect
to
a
broadcaster
being
required
to
allocate
25%
of
its
broadcast
time
to
public
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
is
a
difference
between
broadcasters
and
cables
and
newspapers,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
spectrum
limitations?
justice
byron
r.
white
easement
is
over
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
under?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
limitations
on
them
are
more
on
being
able
to
get
them
more
economic
than
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
case
involves
the
validity
of
certain
regulations
issued
by
the
federal
communications
commission
in
1976.
under
these
regulations
cable
television
systems
have
3,500
subscribers
and
carry
television
signals
must
develop
at
least
a
20-channel
capacity
by
1986
and
they
must
make
available
at
least
four
channels
were
use
by
public,
educational,
local
government
and
leased-access
users.
and
in
addition,
they
must
furnish
equipment
and
facilities
for
such
access
purposes.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
set
aside
the
regulations
as
unauthorized
by
the
communications
act
of
1934.
we
affirmed
that
judgment.
as
we
explain
in
the
opinion
we
have
filed,
the
commission’s
authority
for
cable
casting
is
ancillary
to
its
power
to
regulate
broadcasters.
and
these
regulations
could
not
be
validly
applied
to
broadcasting
because
they
would
too
deeply
intrude
on
the
editorial
discretion
and
journalistic
freedom
that
the
act
intend
to
do
reserve
to
broadcast
licensees.
in
particular,
section
3(h)
of
the
act
expressly
forbids
imposing
common
carrier
obligations
on
broadcasters.
and
as
we
understand
the
regulations
at
issue,
they
treat
cable
casters
at
least
in
part
as
common
carriers.
this
we
have
concluded
and
as
we
have
explained
in
the
opinion
is
forbidden
by
the
act.
we
thus
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
without
reaching
the
constitutional
challenges
presented
to
the
regulations.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined
mr.
justice
stevens.
