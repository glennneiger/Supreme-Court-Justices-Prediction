justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
correct
that
the
rule
applies
even
if
there
is
no
unused
capacity,
even
if
there
was
a
full
that
a
licensee
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
next
year
or
two,
they
do
get
enough
period
that
they
would
like
to
put
on,
they
are
restricted
as
to
just
one
thing
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
following
upon
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
other
licensee's
isn't
there
a
similarity
between
these
rules
and
the
prime
time
rules
that
say
only
three
out
of
the
four
hours
of
prime
time
can
be
used
for
network
television?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
quite
right,
don't
they
have
the
judgment
as
to
which
materials
will
be
selected
and
which
sources
of
material
will
be
used?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
just
a
matter
of
editorial
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
analogy
of
the
telephone
company
you
really
did
not
realize
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
could
you
clear
up
one
detail
for
me?
if
the
public
access
channel
is
not
sufficient
to
take
care
of
the
domain
for
public
access
materials,
how
does
the
cable
television
company
decide
which
applicant
to
satisfy,
is
there
any
regulation
on
that
or
is
it
first
come
first
serve,
do
they
exercise
editorial
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
perhaps
i
shouldn't
ask
these
kind
of
questions
like
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
does
this
converter
that
would
increase
capacity
from
12
to
20
does
that
only
goes
on
the
sets
or
that
goes
on
the
cable
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
system
itself,
how
does
system
itself
get
capacity
increased
from
12
to
20?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
mr.
shapiro
that
it
as
a
fact
of
the
matter,
any
one
local
market
is
apt
to
be
served
by
only
one
cable
system
because
of
these
problems
of
physical
installation
and
the
like?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
there
was
power
to
promulgate
these
rules,
if
they
were
not
limited
to
systems
that
retransmitted
television
stations?
