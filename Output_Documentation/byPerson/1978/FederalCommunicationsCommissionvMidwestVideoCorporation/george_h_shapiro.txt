mr.
george
h.
shapiro
i
certainly
will
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
should
begin
by
asking
answering
mr.
justice
white's
question.
the
fcc
does
have
rules
which
prohibits
broadcast
stations
from
owning
cable
television
systems
within
the
service
areas
of
the
broadcast
station.
the
great
bee
contour
is
a
line,
imaginary
line
that
extends
about
60.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
not
in
other
markets.
in
light
of
before
getting
to
the
legal
arguments
that
i
would
like
to
make
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
some
of
the
specifics
of
the
rules
and
their
impact
on
cable
systems
because
midwest
video's
perception
of
how
those
rules
affect
it
is
quite
different
from
that
described
by
mr.
wallace.
it
is
true
that
commencing
on
the
effective
date
of
the
rules
cable
systems
are
required
to
dedicate
one
full
channel
to
use
by
the
public
for
educational
governmental
public
and
leased-access
users.
this
requirement
alone
involves
generally
one-twelfth
to
one-twentieth
of
the
assets
of
the
company
and
we
do
not
regard
that
as
an
insubstantial
requirement,
but
the
rules
actually
require
much
more
than
that.
the
rules
themselves
specify
that
four
separate
dedicated
access
channels
will
be
provided.
it's
under
a
qualification
to
the
rule
which
indicates
that
if
there
is
not
immediate
demand
for
all
four
of
those
channels
then
cable
systems
may
until
the
demand
develops
combine
different
types
of
access
programming
on
one
channel.
now
what
type
of
demand
requires
the
activation
of
another
channel?
it's
a
very
minimal
type
of
demand.
the
rule
specifies
that
cable
system
must
activate
on
additional
access
channel
if
existing
channels
are
in
use
during
80%
of
the
weekdays
monday
through
friday
for
80%
of
the
time
during
any
consecutive
three
hour
stretch
for
six
weeks,
six
consecutive
weeks.
if
you
apply
a
little
mathematics
to
that
what
it
means
is
that
less
than
two
and
a
half
hours
of
access
used
per
day
on
a
cable
channel
four
days
a
week
for
six
weeks
requires
the
activation
on
additional
access
channel
if
the
system
has
the
activated
channel
capacity.
so
while
there
are
demand
usage
requirements
all
of
the
momentum
of
the
rules
is
to
encourage
the
implementation
of
more
and
more
channels
as
only
minimal
usage
requirements
are
met.
and
those
requirements
don't
end
when
four
channels
are
activated.
they
continue
ad
infinitum
as
i
said
before
up
to
the
activated
channel
capacity
of
the
cable
system.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
your
honor,
cable
system
channels
are
--
a
television
set
is
only
able
to
receive
normally
12
channels
of
vhf
transmission.
in
order
to
add
new
channels
your
cable
system
has
to
--
most
cable
systems
have
essentially
twelve
channels,
at
least
twelve
channels.
to
add
additional
channels
the
cable
system
has
to
do
one
or
two
things,
he
might
be
able
to
put
in
a
converter
which
will
take
signals
coming
down
the
cable
at
frequencies
the
television
set
will
not
receive
and
convert
them
to
frequencies
the
set
will
receive.
this
will
give
him
extra
channels.
he
may
have
to
replace
his
old
cable
which
may
not
be
able
to
carry
more
than
12
channels,
other
cable
with
larger
capacity
or
he
may
string
a
second
cable
but
basically
channels
are
added
in
incremental
blocks.
initially
a
system
will
have
12
channels.
the
next
incremental
block
tends
to
run
another
eight
channels
or
so
up
to
20
and
so
forth.
the
access
rules
also
require
cable
systems
to
adopt
their
own
rules
requiring
that
the
use
of
their
channels
be
provided
on
a
first
come
non-discriminatory
basis
and
prohibiting
the
cable
system
from
exercising
any
program
content
control
over
the
channels.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
normally
it
goes
on
the
set
your
honor.
it's
a
little
box
that
fits
on
top
of
the
set
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
it
costs
about
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
well
this
depends
on
when
the
system
--
modern
systems
have
the
capacity
to
deliver
20
or
more
channels
if
converters
exist.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
the
purchase
–
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
cost
of
converters.
i
believe
if
they
give
us
something
like
40
dollars
per
converter.
that
only
takes
cable
systems
up
to
a
total
of
about
somewhere
between
20
and
30
channels.
it's
not
the
unlimited
60
or
80
type
channels
that
you
see
in
some
descriptions
of
cable.
the
access
rule
is
also
required
cable
systems
to
provide
one
channel
for
public
use
without
any
charge
and
to
provide
time
for
educational
and
local
government
use
for
period
of
five
years
without
any
charge.
no
commercials
can
be
presented
on
the
public
local
governmental
or
excuse
me
the
public,
governmental
or
educational
access
channels.
cable
systems
must
install
studio
and
origination
equipment
for
the
presentation
of
public
access
programs.
no
charge
can
be
made
for
the
use
of
the
studio
or
an
equipment
for
public
access
programs
not
exceeding
five
minutes
in
length
and
charges
for
longer
public
access
programs
must
be
reasonable
and
consistent
with
the
goal
of
affording
a
low
cost
means
of
television
access.
moreover
if
public
access
users
produce
their
own
programs,
cable
systems
cannot
charge
for
the
use
of
the
playback
equipment
necessary,
but
offer
the
time
of
the
system
personnel
required
to
operate
the
equipment
even
if
the
access
user
wishes
to
run
the
programs
outside
of
the
normal
business
hours
of
the
cable
system.
new
cable
systems
must
be
installed
with
a
minimum
channel
capacity
of
twenty
channels
and
the
technical
capability
for
non-voice,
two-way
return
communications.
existing
systems
have
until
1986
to
meet
these
requirements.
now
these
requirements
have
a
severe
fact
--
impact
on
the
ability
of
cable
systems
to
select
and
present
the
type
of
program
--
to
present
programming
to
their
subscribers.
there
is
an
abundance
of
programming
available
to
cable
systems
to
fill
their
channels.
this
programming
has
been
described
in
some
detail
at
pages
10
through
18
of
midwest
video's
brief.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
well,
your
honor
i
thought
that
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
cbs
versus
democratic
national
committee
was
a
barrier
to
that.
i
thought
that
section
3
(h)
of
the
communications
act
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
are
you
asking
whether
the
fcc
can
require
a
broadcast
station
to
provide
a
certain
category
of
programming
during
a
certain
percentage
of
its
time
without
dictating
the
–-
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
without
--
and
leaving
the
content
of
that
programming
to
the
broadcast
station.
i
believe
that's
a
very
close
question.
i
think
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
i
believe
that
they
could.
i
was
describing
that
programming
choices
that
are
available
to
cable
operators
to
fill
their
channels,
aside
from
broadcast
signals
which
they
require
to
carry,
there
is
available
to
cable
systems
the
programming
of
independent
educational
and
specialty
television
stations,
pay
television
type
programming
consisting
mainly
of
movies
and
sports
events,
religious
programmings
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
what
you
get
on
them
tuck
it
from
atlanta
georgia
your
honor
probably
an
independent
signal
of
a
television
station
which
is
distributed
by
satellite.
there
are
other
types
of
sports
programming.
i
have
described
in
the
brief,
sports
package,
events
from
madison
square
garden
which
is
not
the
retransmission.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
no,
it's
distributed
by
satellite
your
honor
but
it's
not
the
retransmission
of
a
broadcast
signal.
it's
programming
sold
directly
to
cable
systems
without
going
and
not
simply
carriage
of
a
broadcast.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
no
your
honor,
it's
sold
by
a
joint
venture
of
madison
square
garden
and
a
cable
company
which
distributes
the
programming.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
no,
it
is
not
a
broadcaster.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
it's
originated
programming.
there
are
no
regulations
that
are
applicable
to
it.
this
is
essential
to
the
point
which
i
am
trying
to
make
which
is
that
there
is
today
a
considerable
amount
of
programming
distributed
by
cable
system,
two
cable
systems,
created
four
cable
systems
which
cable
systems
may
choose
or
not
choose
may
choose
to
carry
or
not
to
carry
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
the
cable
system
does
not
originate
it
in
the
same
sense
that
a
broadcast
station
which
carries
a
network
program
doesn't
originate.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
it
doesn't
prepare
it,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
there
are
numerous
types
of
programming
of
this
kind
that
the
access
rules
impair
the
ability
of
the
cable
operator
to
pick
and
choose
between.
in
fact
the
question
arose
when
mr.
wallace
was
speaking
about
whether
cable
systems
ever
edit
any
of
these
type
of
programming.
we've
cited
some
language
in
our
brief
from
the
fcc's
reporting
order
adopting
equal
employment
opportunity
rules
where
the
fcc
cites
some
examples
of
cable
operators
specifically
doing
some
editing
of
the
programming
that's
distributed
to
them
and
which
they
receive
by
satellite.
i
would
like
also
to
make
it
clear
mr.
wallace
has
indicated
that
there
would
be
no
bumping
of
programming
if
a
cable
system
was
presenting
a
certain
type
of
programming
and
an
access
demand
arose
and
there
was
no
vacant
channel
for
access,
he
is
indicated
there
would
no
bumping.
i
believe
that's
true
for
programs
that
were
not
carried
prior
to,
or
that
were
being
carried
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
these
rules
in
1976.
much
of
the
programming
which
i
have
been
describing
and
which
i
described
in
our
brief
has
become
available
to
cable
systems
since
1976
and
what
the
commission
says
is
that
its
our
intention
that
established
cable
cast
services
provided
by
cable
system
operators
will
not
be
automatically
displaced,
but
if
there
are
conflicts
between
channels
users
we
are
prepared
to
consider
each
such
situation
individually
on
its
merits.
this
means
that
a
cable
system
whose
channels
are
full
and
the
access
channel
demand
arises
has
go
to
the
fcc
and
the
fcc
then
has
to
consider
whether
it
is
--
whether
it
would
be
the
madison
square
garden
programming
or
religious
programming
delivered
by
satellite
or
whether
it
would
be
movies,
the
fcc
has
--
as
a
super
program
director
and
make
a
judgment
about
whether
this
access
use
is
a
more
valuable
use
than
the
use
that
the
cable
operator
has
been
making
of
the
channel.
well
i
think
that
this
has
given
sufficient
background
as
to
some
of
the
reasons
why
midwest
video
and
other
companies
in
the
industry
are
concerned
about
these
rules.
i
would
like
to
pass
on
for
the
moment
now
to
the
jurisdictional
argument
and
why
we
think
that
these
rules
clearly
do
exceed
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
i
would
like
to
also
note
that
a
question
was
raised
earlier
in
the
argument
as
to
whether
why
the
eighth
circuit
discussed
constitutional
issues
and
whether
there
was
in
the
appendix
on
page
65
the
court
specifically
states
that
the
first
amendment
overturns
another
constitutional
considerations
present
in
the
1976
report
are
such
as
to
reinforce
our
conclusions
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
i
think
it
is
traditional
that
courts
do
at
least,
it's
not
unusual
for
courts
to
look
at
constitutional
issues
because
it
may
influence
their
views
on
the
jurisdiction
so
that
they
may
not
be
required
to
reach
a
constitutional
decision.
by
turning
to
the
jurisdiction,
this
court
in
both
midwest
i
and
southwestern
held
that
the
fcc
has
authority
under
section
2
(a)
of
the
communications
act
to
regulate
cable
systems,
no
question
about
that.
it's
not
an
issue,
but
section
2
(a)
in
and
off
itself
does
not
specify
any
objectives
for
which
the
fcc's
regular
authority
regulatory
authority
can
be
exercised.
2
(a)
alone
without
reference
to
something
in
the
act,
we
believe
would
be
an
unlawful
delegation
like
congress
to
the
fcc
to
legislate
as
it
pleases
and
the
rules
before
this
court
in
midwest
i
the
plurality
opinion
upheld
the
rules
because
it
looked
carefully
at
the
statutory
provisions
and
the
goals
which
the
commission
was
attempting
--
indicated
it
was
seeking
to
implement
in
adopting
the
mandatory
origination
rules
and
it
concluded
that
the
mandatory
origination
rule
met
those
goals.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
well
the
commission
--
they
were
the
goals
of
increasing
the
outlets
of
community
expression
and
providing
diversified
programming.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
it
was
connected
to
the
commissions
broadcast
regulatory
goals.
it
was
in
the
broadcast
goals
of
the
act
that
the
commission
found
the
limits
which
it
used
to
test
the
authority
of
the
fcc.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
well,
the
court
found
them
in
section
1,
it
found
them
in
section
303
(g)
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
take
action
to
further
the
larger
and
more
effective
use
of
radio
in
the
public
interest
and
it
found
them
in
section
307
(b)
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
allocate
radio
facilities
on
a
fair
efficient
and
equitable
basis.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
i
think
its
just
the
contrary
your
honor.
i
think
it's
even
the
plurality
opinion
is
specifically
tied
to
testing
the
fcc's
action
against
goals
statutory
goals.
that
was
a
very
close
decision.
there
was
not
a
majority.
it
was
only
a
plurality.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
there
was
a
judgment.
we
think
that
rules
now
before
this
court
go
far
beyond
anything
that
was
contemplated
in
midwest
i.
we
think
so
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all
the
rules
in
midwest
i
were
not
contrary
to
any
established
goal
of
broadcast
regulation.
the
court
found
that
they
met
specified
goals.
here
we
find
that
we
believe
that
this
court's
opinion
in
cbs
versus
democratic
national
committee
established
the
fact
that
preservation
of
the
goals
of
private
journalism
and
editorial
control
are
fundamental
to
broadcast
regulation.
the
court
pointed
out
that
congress
specifically
dealt
with
and
firmly
rejected
the
argument
that
broadcast
facility
should
be
opened
on
a
non-selective
basis
to
all
persons
wishing
to
talk
about
public
issues.
in
responding
to
arguments
that
the
first
amendment
required
individual
access
to
broadcast
facilities,
the
court
referred
to
the
erosion
of
journalistic
discretion
and
the
transfer
of
control
over
treatment
of
public
issues
for
licensees
who
are
accountable
for
broadcast
performance.
the
government's
principle
answer
to
this
is
that
the
access
goals
--
is
that
we
are
arguing
about
mutually
inconsistent
goals
and
that
while
it
concedes
that
this
goal
of
editorial
control
and
discretion
may
exist,
the
commission
has
selected
other
goals
and
its
within
the
commission's
discretion
to
select
and
choose
between
goals.
we
think
that
the
answer
to
this
is
that
in
the
very
decisions
which
were
reviewed
by
this
court
in
the
cbs
case
in
dealing
with
section
3
(h)
and
its
relationship
to
the
goal
of
editorial
judgment
and
control
by
broadcasters,
the
fcc
itself
did
not
treat
this
goal
as
one
to
be
placed
in
the
balance
with
other
perhaps
conflicting
goals.
the
fcc's
opinion
treated
section
3
(h)
as
a
statutory
prescription
and
the
fcc
held
that
broadcasters
were
not
required
to
sell
time
to
individuals
or
groups
to
comment
on
public
issues.
it
was
this
determination
of
the
fcc
that
the
court
upheld
in
the
cbs
case.
so
if
that's
the
fcc's
policy
as
opposed
--
as
applied
to
broadcasters
and
it's
a
statutory
policy
that
the
fcc
regards
as
paramount,
we
have
difficulty
seeing
how
if
the
commission
must
look
to
broadcast
regulatory
goals
for
its
authority
to
regulate
cable
television,
how
it
can
jettison
that
goal
as
applied
to
cable
systems.
we
think
this
court's
decision
in
the
cbs
versus
dnc
case
is
also
quite
consistent
with
that
approach,
but
there
is
another
reason
why
we
think
that
these
rules
far
exceed
the
fcc's
jurisdiction.
section
3
(h)
of
the
act
specifies
that
a
person
engaged
in
radio
broadcasting
shall
not
insofar
as
such
person
is
engaged,
redeem
common
carrier.
in
midwest
video
i,
the
fcc's
actions
were
not
contrary
to
any
specified
means
of
regulation
in
the
act
and
therefore
the
subject
of
regulatory
means
was
not
discussed
but
section
3
(h)
prohibits
the
fcc
from
utilizing
common
carrier
means
to
achieve
broadcast
goals.
we
think
that
any
other
conclusion
and
for
that
reason
we
don't
think
that
we
think
that
the
fcc
is
also
limited
in
that
it
means
that
it
can
apply
to
cable
systems,
perhaps
they
need
not
be
the
exact
same
means
but
to
permit
the
fcc
will
apply
a
means
specifically
withheld
for
that
from
them
in
the
broadcasting
area
gives
as
we
believe
is
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
we
think
that
there
are
very
good
reasons
for
taking
this
position.
any
other
conclusion
would
blend
two
types
of
regulations
that
are
mutually
inconsistent
and
they
would
leave
the
fcc's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
cable
systems
subject
to
no
meaningful
standards.
some
examples,
we
have
already
discussed
the
fact
that
editorial
judgment
and
control
are
basic
to
broadcast
regulation,
but
there
the
antithesis
of
common
carrier
regulation,
common
carrier
regulation
is
based
upon
total
lack
of
control
by
the
owner
of
the
facilities.
in
order
to
ensure
that
broadcasters
do
not
practice
racial
discrimination
in
the
programming
judgments
and
in
the
related
ascertainment
of
community
needs
to
be
served
by
their
programming
the
fcc
can
adopt
equal
employment
opportunity
rules
applicable
to
broadcasters.
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
naacp
versus
federal
power
commission
makes
it
clear
that
most
regulatory
statutes
governing
common
carrier
operations
will
not
support
the
adoption
of
equal
employment
opportunity
rules.
government
is
generally
forbidden
from
imposing
common
carrier
or
public
utility
obligations
on
a
business
unless
it
permits
the
business
to
earn
a
fair
rate
of
return
and
the
hallmark
of
common
carrier
regulation
is
generally
detailed
regulation.
broadcasting
on
the
other
hand
is
a
feel
to
free
competition
without
rate
regulation.
the
fcc
does
not
regulate
most
cable
television
rates
and
it
forbids
any
government
entity
from
regulating
rates
for
pay
tv
services
the
cable
systems
provide.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
the
congress
has
given
the
fcc
authority
to
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
to
do
what
to
regulate
or
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
cable
systems
has
common
carriers?
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
of
broadcasters,
your
honor
or
cable
systems?
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
to
the
extent
that
--
the
position
thus
far
your
honor
the
court's
recognition
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fcc
is
based
upon
--
has
been
based
on
broadcast
regulatory
authority.
broadcasting
is
a
feel
to
free
competition
the
fcc
doesn't
regulate
rates
in
the
broadcasting.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
huh?
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
i
don't
think
it
could
under
the
existing
statute.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
to
regulate
broadcasting
rates?
your
honor,
it
would
raise
the
question
of
whether
broadcasting
was
the
type
of
business
affected
with
the
public
interest
that
was
appropriate
for
a
form
of
utility
regulation.
for
purposes
of
our
jurisdictional
argument
i
think
that's
right
but
i
can't
--
it
is
not
a
subject
that
i
have
looked
at
closely.
alright
there
are
other
differences
between
common
carrier
and
broadcast
regulation
common
--
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
another
one
in
terms
of
the
need,
the
fcc
requires
a
strong
showing
of
need
for
common
carrier
facilities
before
it
builds
them,
before
it
require
--
before
it
permits
parties
to
build
the
facilities.
if
the
fcc
can
choose
one
day
from
its
broadcast
authority
and
another
day
from
common
carrier
utilize
common
carrier
means
which
is
designed
to
achieve
completely
different
aims
and
completely
different
goals
the
next
day
the
discretion
that's
left
in
the
fcc
to
pick
from
two
contradictory
schemes
of
regulation
would
leave
its
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
cable
television
virtually
without
limit.
so
we
--
for
those
reasons
we
believe
that
the
rules
--
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed
on
the
matter
of
the
fcc's
jurisdiction.
i
see
that
i
only
have
a
few
minutes
and
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
about
the
first
amendment,
obviously
the
subject
to
that
editorial
control
and
the
function
of
editors.
as
i
have
discussed
it
in
the
jurisdictional
context
it's
equally
relevant
in
the
first
amendment
context.
this
court
in
the
miami
herald
versus
tornillo
quoted
constitution's
first
amendment
status
to
the
function
of
editors
and
it's
extremely
important.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
excuse
me
your
honor
i
didn't
her
that.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
perhaps
i
should
say
recognized
rather
than
gave.
we
believe
that
cable
systems
for
purposes
of
first
amendment
analysis
are
considerably
more
like
newspapers
than
like
broadcast
stations.
this
is
a
view
which
not
only
the
eighth
circuit
below
has
taken
but
the
home
box
office,
the
dc
circuit
in
the
home
box
office
took
situation
took
a
similar
position.
there
are
of
course
differences
between
a
cable
system
and
a
newspaper,
but
in
many
respects
they
are
the
same.
some
one
must
subscribe
to
the
services
in
order
to
get
--
to
receive
that
services.
you
must
make
an
affirmative
decision
and
pay
someone.
both
offer
multiple
services.
they
have
a
basic
type
of
service
that
people
usually
buy
them
for
but
they
seek
fiercely
additional
subscribers
based
on
other
services.
with
the
newspaper
its
basic
service
is
news,
but
it
gets
readers
because
of
its
sports
page
and
its
comic
strips
and
its
society
page.
with
the
cable
system,
its
basic
service
is
retransmission
of
television
signals,
but
it
offers
paid
movies
and
it
offers
religion
and
it
offers
sports
and
it
will
soon
be
offering
various
types
of
public
affairs
programming.
and
the
function
of
a
cable
system
is
very
analogous
in
terms
of
first
amendment
analysis,
distribution
of
information
to
the
public
to
that
of
a
newspaper.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
well
your
honor
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
yes
there
is
the
different
broad
--
different
regulation
is
always
been
applicable
to
broadcasters
than
to
other
media.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
because
primarily
of
spectrum
limitation,
there
have
been
other
types
of
differences
in
the
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
spectrum
limitations
do
not
apply
to
cable,
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
to
the
extent
that
it
uses
any
your
honor,
it
uses
its
rights
of
way
to
the
string
cables
over
public
easements,
streets,
highways.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
no,
normally
these
are
easements
owned
by
states
or
municipalities.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
easement
is
over
property.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
or
under.
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
that
is
precisely
our
point
your
honor
and
in
the
miami
herald
versus
tornillo,
this
court
held
that
economic
restrains
did
not
--
mr.
george
h.
shapiro
your
honor,
that
is
true
in
by
far
the
bulk
of
the
instances,
just
as
it
is
true
that
there
is
only
one
newspaper
in
by
far
the
bulk
of
the
markets.
there
are
some
with
two,
midwest
video
happens
to
operate
in
two
communities
where
there
are
two.
it
is
not
the
rule.
it's
very
small
percentage
of
the
cases,
but
it
does
happen.
my
time
is
expired
in
it.
thank
you.
