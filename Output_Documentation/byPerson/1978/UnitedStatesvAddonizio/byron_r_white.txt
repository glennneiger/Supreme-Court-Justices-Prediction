and
murray?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
that's
why
i
would
expect
you
to
say
that
why
not?
they
just
say
that
the
judge
can't
--
has
any
power
once
the
sentence
has
begun
to
change
his
probation
ruling?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
they
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
does,
yes,
he
certainly
does
and
i
thought
you
said
that
2255
would
be
available
for
the
judge
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
judge
discovered
some
facts,
what
if
the
probation
officer
came
in
and
said
“i
gave
you
a
very
bad
report
last
year,
this
fellow
should
have
really
gone
on
probation,
instead
he
is
in
prison
for
five
years.”
and
the
judge
says
“what
do
you
mean?”
he
gives
him
some
facts
he
didn't
have,
and
the
judge
says
“if
i
had
known
that,
i'd
put
him
on
probation.”
and
the
probation
officer
says
“well
this
is
that
argument
in
the
supreme
court
last
week,
you've
got
power
under
2255
to
effect
a
different
result
based
on
facts
you
didn't
know.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you'd
have
to
do
something
about
the
--
about
affronti,
wouldn't
you,
and
murray?
