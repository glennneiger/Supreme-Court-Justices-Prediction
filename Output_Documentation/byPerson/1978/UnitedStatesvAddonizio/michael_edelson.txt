mr.
michael
edelson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brother,
mr.
easterbrook
gave
you
some
background,
factual
background
in
the
addonizio
case.
he
told
you
about
the
indictment.
he
added
up
the
cumulative
sentence
which
might
have
been
imposed.
to
a
certain
extent,
i
think
that
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
this
was
a
15
co-defendant
multi
count
conspiracy
trial.
the
trial
judge
sat
through
a
very
lengthy
trial.
after
conviction,
the
trial
judge
set
a
sentence
for
a
particular
purpose
to
achieve
a
particular
end.
in
his
opinion
granting
the
section
2255
motion,
judge
barlow
said
“yes
indeed,
i
felt
mr.
addonizio
was
guilty
of
a
very
severe
offense.”
mr.
michael
edelson
well,
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
in
that
entire
indictment
mr.
addonizio
was
accused
of
receiving
$4,000.00.
mr.
michael
edelson
alright,
i
will
--
--
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
judge
barlow
also
stated
at
page
9
in
the
appendix
in
response
to
arguments
made
by
trial
counsel,
judge
barlow
stated
“an
intricate
conspiracy
of
this
magnitude,
i
suggest
to
you
mr.
addonizio,
could
have
never
succeeded
without
the
then
mayor's
approval
and
participation.”
mr.
michael
edelson
he
was
the
then
mayor.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
finding
of
guilt
in
regard
to
mr.
addonizio
was
the
finding
that
he
was
the
mayor,
and
as
the
mayor
he
bore
ultimate
responsibility
in
terms
--
mr.
michael
edelson
i
am
suggesting,
if
your
honor
please,
that
this
record
does
not
show
that
he
was
in
it
up
to
his
eyes.
mr.
michael
edelson
judge
--
i
understand
that,
yes
he
--
judge
barlow
found
it
to
be
extremely
severe
and
as
your
honor
said
that
may
be
an
understatement.
mr.
michael
edelson
what
judge
barlow
has
said
is
clearly
set
forth,
the
words
are
there.
what
he
intended,
his
evaluation
of
the
severity
of
the
offense
and
what
he
intended
to
be
the
punishment
based
upon
his
evaluation
of
the
severity
of
the
offense,
he
has
also
said
very
clearly
and
he
has
said
that
in
his
opinion
granting
the
motion,
the
section
2255
motion.
mr.
michael
edelson
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
he
was
in
one
--
he
was
not
aware
that
the
parole
board
would
reevaluate
the
severity
of
the
offense
and
take
into
consideration
his
statements
--
mr.
michael
edelson
well
--
mr.
michael
edelson
if
your
honor
please,
in
reviewing
the
presentence
report
and
everything
said
by
way
of
mitigation
and
aggravation
and
the
weight
that
they
ultimately
gave
to
that
review,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
were
in
fact
reevaluating
the
severity
of
the
offense.
mr.
michael
edelson
well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
do
at
least
know
that
judge
barlow
felt
that
the
punishment
which
fit
the
crime
and
his
evaluation
of
the
severity
would
have
been
incarceration
for
a
period
of
three
and
a
half
to
four
years.
that
is
perfectly
clear
from
what
judge
barlow
has
said
in
his
motion
granting
the
section
2255,
and
his
opinion
granting
them
section
2255
motion.
mr.
michael
edelson
well
neither
court
addressed
murray
and
affronti,
but
yes
they
did
give
reasons
why
they
felt
section
2255
--
mr.
michael
edelson
well
i
--
murray
and
affronti,
if
your
honor
please,
did
both
--
if
i'm
correct
did
both
deal
with
the
interpretation
of
probation
statutes.
and
probation
is
somewhat
different
than
parole,
and
also
in
this
case
what
both
judge
barlow
and
the
third
circuit
found
was
that
there
was
in
fact
a
radical
change
in
the
criteria
which
was
applied
in
parole
decision-making
after
sentence
and
before
parole
eligibility,
and
that
was
the
controlling
fact.
mr.
michael
edelson
well,
i
would
agree
that
there
is
a
suggestion
there,
but
i
also
believe
that
the
cases
are
in
fact
distinguishable.
i
can't
answer
for
the
third
circuit
or
judge
barlow
as
to
why
those
issues
were
not
addressed
in
the
opinions.
if
the
court
please,
when
the
sentence
of
ten
years
were
set,
at
least
what
judge
barlow
says
he
was
doing
was
something
very
specific.
he
was
trying
to
set
in
accordance
with
the
statutes
then
in
effect,
and
what
was
known
by
sentencing
judges
a
time
of
incarceration.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
could
the
judge
set
a
three
to
seven
sentence
and
say
he
may
not
be
released
until
four
years.
in
1970,
in
order
for
judge
barlow
to
have
guaranteed
that
mr.
addonizio
stayed
in
prison,
stayed
incarcerated
for
the
three
and
a
half
to
four
years
that
he
intended,
he
had
to
give
him
a
10-year
sentence.
but
he
also
had
the
expectation
that
when
he
became
eligible
for
parole
under
the
statute,
under
4202,
at
the
one-third
point,
his
eligibility
would
then
be
considered
based
upon
his
institutional
record
and
the
evaluation
of
the
probability
of
recidivism.
mr.
michael
edelson
well
i
think
they
did
give
him
the
right
to
guarantee
the
minimum.
mr.
michael
edelson
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
edelson
because
the
statute
provides
when
there's
--
provided
when
--
and
still
provides
when
there
is
a
straight
sentence
then
the
inmate
is
not
eligible
for
parole
until
he
has
served
one-third
of
his
sentence.
mr.
michael
edelson
well,
there
is
nothing
--
i
would
agree
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute.
there
was
a
lot
in
case
law
by
1970.
mr.
michael
edelson
not
in
this
court,
if
your
honor,
i
don't
--
although
there
were
--
there
are
general
comments
on
the
philosophy
of
parole
which
i
assume
were
shared
by
trial
courts
into
their
expectation
of
how
the
parole
system
worked.
in
the
third
circuit,
for
example,
we
had
the
case
of
--
mr.
michael
edelson
--
of
barry
versus
united
states,
excuse
me
i
just
wanted
to
give
you
this
cite.
mr.
michael
edelson
the
way
the
court
said
that
the
reasonable
expectation
is
the
prisoner
will
serve
one-third
of
the
full
sentence.
mr.
michael
edelson
if
there
was
such
an
expectation
and
if
sentences
were
imposed
based
upon
that
expectation,
it
is
our
contention
that
there
was
a
crucial
error
in
the
imposition
of
sentence.
mr.
michael
edelson
yes,
even
though
this
court
had
never
sustained
the
third
circuit's
opinion,
because
there
was
nothing
from
this
court
to
say
whether
or
not
there
was
an
expectation
other
than
this
court
--
there
are
--
there
is
language
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
for
example
which
is
similar
to
language
in
many
circuit
court
cases
that
the
object
of
parole
is
to
release
the
inmate
as
quickly
as
the
parole
authorities
have
determined
that
he
has
shown
rehabilitation
and
can
be
put
back
on
the
street
without
the
fear
of
recidivism
without
--
mr.
michael
edelson
if
your
honor
please,
that
was
very
specifically
added
in
the
1976
parole
commission
and
reorganization
act,
a
comparison
between
184203
and
the
present
184206
(a)
which
sets
the
criteria
shows
that
first
of
all,
the
old
criteria
did
not
tell
the
parole
commission
or
parole
board
at
that
time,
to
look
at
the
severity
of
the
offense.
and
4202,
i'm
sorry,
420
--
i
was
correct
at
first,
4203
said
that
if
it
appears
to
the
parole
board
from
a
report
by
the
proper
institutional
officers
or
upon
application
by
a
prisoner
eligible
for
release
on
parole
that
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
such
prisoner
will
live
and
remain
at
liberty
without
violating
the
laws.
and
if
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
such
release
is
not
incompatible
with
the
welfare
of
society,
the
board
may
in
its
discretion
authorize
the
release
of
such
prisoner
on
parole.
that,
if
your
honor
please,
should
be
compared
to
4206
(a)
today
which
contains
the
additional
language
“if
an
eligible
prisoner
has
substantially
observed
the
rules
of
the
institutions
or
institutions
to
which
he
has
been
confined
and
if
the
commission
upon
considering
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
history
and
characteristics
of
the
prisoner
determines,
that
release
will
not
depreciate
the
seriousness
of
his
offense,
or
promote
disrespect
for
the
law.”
those
words
were
not
in
the
statute
in
1970
they
were
--
mr.
michael
edelson
i
--
mr.
michael
edelson
judge,
i
believe
that
until
the
new
act,
the
punishment,
retribution,
deterrence
aspect
were
covered
generally
by
the
sentence
imposed.
parole
was
not
viewed
as
having
a
primary
or
even
meaningful
secondary
purpose
in
serving
those
functions.
parole
started
out
as
an
ameliorative
measure.
parole
started
--
parole
was
to
a
certain
extent,
the
embodiment
of
the
rehabilitation
model
in
the
federal
system,
not
sentencing.
sentencing
fully
was
supposed
to
take
care
of
this
deterrence.
sentencing
fully
was
supposed
to
take
care
of
punishment,
but
parole
was
not.
mr.
michael
edelson
i'm
not
--
mr.
michael
edelson
i
am
familiar
with
the
federal
judges
attend
institutes
on
sentencing.
i
have
never
attended,
i
have
read
some
reports
and
synopsis
of
things
that
are
said
of
all
the
things
that
i
have
found
published
that
have
taken
place
at
those
institutes,
i
would
say
that
most
of
the
comments
of
the
judges
were
concerned
with
their
assumption
that
in
fact
release
was
being
almost
automatically
granted.
and
our
case
does
not
depend
upon
that.
severity
of
the
offense
was
mentioned
but
our
position
here
is
that
there
was
almost
a
flip
flopping
of
what
the
criteria
were
when
they
were
as
applied
in
1970
and
as
presently
applied
and
as
applied
after
mr.
addonizio
was
sentenced
and
became
eligible
for
parole.
mr.
michael
edelson
well,
my
time
is
up
by
if
i
may
just
respond
to
that?
mr.
michael
edelson
i
don't
think
there
was
a
flip-flop
at
all.
i
think
he
was
entirely
consistent.
he
found
that
the
mayor
of
the
city
had
ultimate
responsibility
for
what
he
felt
was
a
horrendous
crime
and
he
fashioned
a
specific
sentence
to
deal
with
that.
the
change
in
the
parole
guidelines
changed
the
import
of
that
sentence
radically.
thank
you.
