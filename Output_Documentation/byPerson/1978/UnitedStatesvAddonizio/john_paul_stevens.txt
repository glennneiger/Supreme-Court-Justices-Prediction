justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
was
it
not
true
at
that
time
if
there
were
a
number
of
narcotics
offenders
who
were
ineligible
for
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
much
do
they
account
for
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
on
that
footnote
47,
how
precise
is
this
one-third?
what's
the
certain
percentage
after
one-third
and
some
61%
sometime
after
one-third?
well
almost
two
weeks
after
third
or
three
weeks
or
how
much?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
fact
they
didn't
have
it
until
after
they
pass
the
one-third
point,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
regulation
provide
that
there's
no
hearing
until
the
one-third,
then
you
have
the
hearing
and
then
whatever
time
it
takes
to
do
the
paperwork,
a
lot
of
people
being
released.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
two
months
enough
to
take
care
of
everybody
who
was
successful
of
this
first
parole
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
correct
is
it
not?
there
was
a
mandatory
parole
hearing
under
the
regulations
in
effect
and
after
one-third?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
is
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
were
even
later
worked
out.
they
got
a
meaningless
hearing
early
in
the
significant
later
as
the
way
it
worked,
at
least
the
seventh
circuit
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
any
event
there
was
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
putting
those
two
aside,
there
was
a
regulation
which
mandated
the
hearing
after
one-third
of
the
sentence
had
been
heard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
approximately.
and
is
it
not
true
that
a
significant
number
of
people
were
released
at
that
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
i
just
want
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
judge
could
not
reasonably
anticipate
that
an
offender
who
had
a
good
institutional
behavior
would
very
likely
be
released
at
the
end
of
approximately
third
of
the
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
was
there
ever
a
claim
in
this
case
that
the
commission
change
in
regulations
constituted
an
ex
post
--
violation
of
ex
post
facto
clause?
