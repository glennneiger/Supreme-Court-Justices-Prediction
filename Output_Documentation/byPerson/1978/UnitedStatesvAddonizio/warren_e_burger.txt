chief

e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
addonizio.
mr.
easterbrook
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
timeframe
in
which
he
expressed
that
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
when
he
imposed
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
standing
does
that
advisory
utterance
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
edelson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
putting
it
mildly,
isn't
it,
in
light
of
the
excoriating
statements
he
made
at
page
10?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i'm
not
--
i'm
concerned
with
what
the
judge
said
about
the
nature
of
his
offense
which
he
committed
by
betrayal
of
trust
as
the
highest
elected
official
of
newark.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
was
the
then
mayor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
are
you
suggesting
that
this
record
doesn't
show
that
he
was
in
it
up
to
his
eyes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
was
an
outrageous
statement
on
the
part
of
judge
barlow
make.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
suggest
that
judge
barlow
was
not
fully
aware
that
the
parole
authorities
would
ultimately
take
into
account
what
he
said
in
passing
on
possible
parole
release?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
to
reevaluate
it,
they're
just
--
it
shows
very
clearly
in
the
record
that
they
didn't
reevaluate
it
they
just
took
judge
barlow's
evaluation.
they
say
at
page
11,
“as
the
highest
elected
official
of
the
city
of
newark,
you
were
convicted
of
an
extortion
conspiracy
in
which
under
color
of
your
official
authority,
you
and
your
co-conspirators
conspired
to
delay,
impede,
obstruct
and
otherwise
thwart
the
construction
in
the
city
of
newark
in
order
to
obtain
a
percentage
of
contract
for
the
privilege
of
working
on
city
construction
projects.”
and
because
of
the
magnitude
of
this
crime,
the
money
being
$241,000.00
indicated,
its
effect
on
the
city
is
very
great
and
so
forth.
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
parole
board
was
doing
what
it
should
do,
namely
take
into
account
the
total
record
up
to
the
time
of
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
including
everything
in
the
presentence
report,
everything
that
the
sentencing
judge
said
either
by
way
of
mitigation
or
aggravation,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
would
read
the
parole
board
statement
as
much
more
moderate
than
judge
barlow's
statements,
not
involving
any
reevaluation
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
another
factor
that's
added
at
every
level
and
that
is
whether
in
weighing
looking
at
the
seriousness
and
gravity
of
the
crime,
the
release
at
that
time
will
disparage
and
depreciate
the
administration
of
justice
and
undermine
the
deterrent
factor
of
punishment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
suppose
they
were
in
the
minds
of
people
who
were
experienced
in
this
activity
and
judges
who
were
imposing
sentences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
nothing
new
about
those
concepts.
you
find
them
through
the
literature
on
the
subject
over
the
last
30
or
40
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
there
certainly
was
a
flip
flop
by
the
sentencing
judge
from
the
expressions
he
gave
at
the
time
of
sentence
and
the
expressions
he
made
when
he
took
his
final
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
greenspan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
the
judge
at
that
stage
have
any
idea
how
the
prisoner
is
going
to
conduct
himself
in
prison
over
a
period
of
three
or
five
years
into
the
future?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
parole
board
can
not
take
into
account
the
nature
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
longer
than
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
longer
than
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
