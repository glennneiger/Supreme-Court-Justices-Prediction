mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
former
mayor
whelan
and
former
councilman
flaherty
from
the
city
of
jersey
city,
new
jersey.
they
too
were
sentenced
under
the,
what's
commonly
known
as
the
federal
extortion
statute
for
selling
to
the
public
in
general,
whoever
was
willing
to
buy,
their
favors
in
government.
unlike
mr.
addonizio,
messrs.
whelan
and
flaherty
were
not
connected
with
organized
crime
and
also
unlike
addonizio,
they
were
sentenced
to
15
years
rather
than
10
years.
also
unlike
addonizio,
there
was
a
tax
problem
that
was
connected
to
the
whelan
and
flaherty
case
which
was
resolved
by
a
plea
of
guilty
and
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
to
be
run
concurrently
with
the
15-year
sentence.
also
unlike
addonizio,
unfortunately
judge
shaw
as
presiding
in
a
much
higher
court,
he
passed
away.
thereafter,
an
application
was
made
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
jersey
and
it
was
referred
to
judge
biunno
who
was
presented
with
the
problem
of
ascertaining
under
the
third
circuit
rule,
what
was
the
expectation
of
judge
shaw
at
the
time
that
he
passed
the
15-year
sentence?
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
regardless
of
what
my
brother,
the
solicitor
general
has
to
say,
he
is
after
the
fact
attempting
to
ascertain
what
was
the
fact
in
1970
and
prior
to
1970
with
regard
to
the
expectations
of
sentencing
judges
at
the
time
that
his
sentence
was
passed
upon
any
prisoner
or
any
convict
before
a
judge.
and
under
the
rule
of
u.s.
versus
barry,
the
courts
themselves
enunciated
the
fact
that
it
was
commonly
known
that
after
one-third
of
the
service
of
the
sentence
imposed
the
prisoner
would
be
released
unless
there
were
factors
that
were
present
at
that
time
to
determine
that
he
should
not
be
released.
and
i
take
the
position
that
under
the
statutes
as
they
were
then
in
existence,
and
as
they
would
be
applicable
today
that
they
only
shifted
not
so
that
it
was
now
upon
the
parole
board
or
the
parole
commission
to
have
a
burden
of
proof
as
to
why
a
prisoner
should
not
be
released
once
he
had
served
the
one-third
of
the
sentence.
the
statute
that
was
in
effect
then
was
the
statute
that
my
clients
were
sentenced
under
and
they
had
every
right
to
expect
that
if
the
met
the
criteria,
as
they
did,
that
they
would
be
released
at
the
end
of
one-third.
and
judge
shaw
had
every
right
to
expect
because
that
is
what
he
had
in
his
mind
at
the
time
that
he
sentenced
the
two
individuals
simply
because
that
was
what
was
in
the
minds
of
all
the
judges
who
were
sentencing
prisoners
at
that
time,
because
that's
what
the
judges
said
in
their
mind
and
it
says
so
in
u.s.
versus
barry.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
it's
not
a
question
to
judge
shaw's
rights.
it's
the
question
of
the
rights
of
individuals
under
the
constitution
to
be
protected
from
an
impingement
upon
the
powers
of
the
judiciary
by
the
powers
of
the
executive.
all
that
the
judge
is
doing
at
the
time
that
he
passes
his
sentence,
or
in
this
case
at
the
time
that
he
acts
under
2255
to
correct
or
modify
a
sentence
is
to
vindicate
the
rights
that
are
inherent
in
the
individual
to
be
sentenced
to
a
term
of
years
that
is
no
more
than
the
judge
wanted
him
to
serve
at
the
time.
now,
if
the
third
circuit
uses
language
that
the
judge
was
frustrated,
that
it's
vindicating
the
judicial
function,
all
its
saying
is
that
it's
vindicating
the
rights
of
individuals
to
have
the
judiciary
determine
how
long
they're
going
to
serve
when
it
was
the
judiciary
that
passed
the
sentence.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no
sir.
all
that
congress
does
is
set
up
the
courts,
the
powers
that
the
courts
are
inherent
in
the
constitution.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no,
sir.
what
the
congress
does
is
pass
a
maximum
under
which
the
court
can
--
is
required
to
act,
that's
the
legislative
function
is
to
determine
the
limitations.
once
the
judge
passes
a
sentence
which
are
within
the
limitations,
that
is
not
for
the
executive
to
say,
unless
the
court
wishes
to
pass
on
to
a
certain
degree
its
rights
in
pronouncing
the
sentence
to
the
executive
to
determine.
now,
you
have
a
statute
that
says,
yes
the
judge
can
make
a
sentence,
pass
a
sentence
that
will
say
“we
are
going
to
sentence
you
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
or
to
the
discretion
of
the
parole
commission”
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
you
have
a
classic
balance
of
power
problem,
one
that
i
haven't
seen
before
this
court
before,
and
that
is
where
does
the
powers
of
the
judiciary
to
vindicate
not
its
rights
but
the
rights
of
the
individuals
stop
and
where
does
the
power
of
the
executive
begin.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
at
magically
at
the
end
of
120
days,
the
courts
have
no
power
whatsoever
to
see
what's
happening.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
magic
in
that
120
days,
and
i
do
believe
that
2255
was
put
there
specifically
for
the
purpose
not
of
vindicating
a
right
of
a
judge,
but
of
upholding
the
right
of
a
judge
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
individual.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
rule
35?
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
think
that
rule
35
deals
with
entirely
different
proposition,
and
that's
not
the
proposition
we
have
before
us.
i
think
that
2255
deals
with,
and
if
i
may
attempt
to
explain
in
this
fashion
with
what
is
probably
the
court
form
knows.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
if
the
judge
has
made
a
mistake,
if
something
has
happened
where
the
judge
for
one
reason
or
another,
wants
to
do
something
different
then
congress
has
given
the
judge
the
authority
to
change
his
sentence
for
whatever
reason
or
no
reason
the
way
i
see
rule
35.
however,
2255
is
entirely
different
where
a
mistake
has
been
made
in
a
nature
of
a
coram
nobis
type
of
a
problem
where
something
has
happened
which
is
a
question
of
fact
which
was
unavailable
or
unaware
to
the
--
at
the
time
that
whatever
happened,
happened.
then
2255
comes
in,
i
--
excuse
me?
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
affronti
and
murray
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
this.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
well,
all
i
could
say
about
--
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
sure
but
that
doesn't
apply
here,
simply
because
affronti
and
murray
assumed
that
the
judge
had
changed
his
mind,
that
the
judge
wants
to
do
something
different
than
what
he
wanted
to
do
before.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no
sir,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
2255
would
be
available
in
situation
where
the
judge
has
passed
a
sentence
based
upon
a
set
of
facts,
he
precede
him
at
that
time
and
which
were
the
facts
that
were
in
existence.
and
in
this
case,
i
would
say
the
state
of
the
law
would
be
a
fact
that
was
in
existence
at
that
time.
2255
is
available
so
that
the
judge
can
say
“now
wait
a
minute,
i
don't
want
something
to
happen
today
that's
different
than
what
i
wanted
to
happen
before.”
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
that
that
wouldn't
be
a
good
rule,
but
i'm
not
arguing
that
rule.
i'm
arguing
something
entirely
different.
i'm
arguing
that
where
the
judge
had
an
intention
where
the
facts
were
the
facts
at
that
point
and
nothing
is
changed,
except
that
somebody
else
wants
to
treat
it
differently
then
2255
applies.
i
don't
know
that
2255
wouldn't
apply
under
the
fact
pattern
which
you've
described
to
me.
i
would
suggest
that
it
would.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
in
that
case,
i
certainly
would
but
not
in
the
case
that
i
argue
here
today.
i
say
affronti
and
murray
just
have
no
place
in
this
argument
and
i
believe
that
your
brother
in
the
third
circuit
so
believed
to
be
going
to
say
they
didn't
even
discuss
it.
i
would
suggest
that
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
wherever
you
have
a
question
as
to
who
has
to
have
the
final
word
in
a
conflict
between
two
co-equal
branches
of
government
that
i
believe
that
is
the
judiciary
that
has
to
have
the
final
word,
unless
there's
a
clear
statutory
or
constitutional
mandate
that
the
judiciary
does
not
have
the
final
word.
otherwise,
you're
going
to
have
a
situation
which
has
been
described
as
a
judicial
frustration
but
it's
not
really
a
judicial
frustration,
although
the
judge
may
feel
himself
frustrated.
what
is
a
frustration
of
the
rights
of
the
individual
who
is
before
the
judicial
system,
who
is
seeking
to
have
the
expectation
that
was
pronounced
upon
him,
vindicated?
now,
i
can
not
accept
any
ruling
which
would
say
that
if
a
judge
has
pronounced
a
sentence
based
upon
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
was
then,
under
the
facts
as
he
precedes
them
to
be
as
they
were
then
that
the
executive
department
can
say
“well
i'm
sorry
judge,
we
have
decided
that
the
sentence
that
you
gave
was
not
severe
enough.
we're
going
to
change
that
sentence.”
now
there
is
no
implicit
or
inherent
right
in
the
executive
department
to
do
that.
there
is
the
implicit
or
inherent
right
in
the
judicial
system
to
see
that
when
a
sentence
is
passed
that
the
expectation
of
the
judge
was
vindicated,
because
it
is
the
expectation
of
the
judge
that
should
be
vindicated
at
this
point
and
not
the
expectation
of
the
executive
department.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
he
can't
and
that's
precisely
why
the
only
discretion
that's
invested
in
the
executive
department
under
that
set
of
sort
of
circumstance
is,
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
is
adapted
to
the
prison
life,
whether
there
is
going
to
be
recidivistic
tendencies,
and
whether
the
other
criteria
which
are
set
forth
in
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
are
met.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
absolutely
not.
simply
because,
in
my
judgment
would
be
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy.
you
would
be
unconstitutionally
enhancing
the
amount
of
time
that
individual
is
going
to
serve
after
the
judge
has
already
said
“i'm
sentencing
you
to
this
sentence
because
of
the
severity
of
the
crime.”
and
now
the
parole
commission
is
going
to
say
“well,
now
that
you've
been
sentenced
because
of
the
severity
of
the
crime,
we're
going
to
keep
you
longer
because
of
the
severity
of
the
crime.”
they
just
doesn't
hang.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
longer
than
the
expectation
of
the
judge
in
sentencing
because
of
the
severity
of
the
crime.
now
at
that
time
it
was
one-third,
i
--
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no,
it's
not
just
a
rubberstamp.
i
think
that
the
--
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
there
was
no
right
in
the
judge
under
2255,
the
judge
would
be
a
rubberstamp.
it
would
be
the
judge
who'd
say
“i'm
going
to
pass
this
sentence
and
i
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen.”
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no,
you
didn't
your
honor,
that
was
my
own
language,
but
that's
what
i
would
learn
from
that.
i
think
that
we're
dealing
with
a
very,
very
narrow,
narrow
issue
which
is
getting
even
narrower,
and
that
is
the
question
of
what
happens
to
sentences
that
were
passed
before
1973
when
the
individual
is
not
released
according
to
what
the
expectation
of
the
court
was
at
the
time
that
the
sentenced
was
passed.
as
the
years
go
by,
we're
not
going
to
be
dealing
with
many
more
of
these
cases.
i
think
that
if
there's
a
constitutional
issue
before
this
court
is
merely
just
where
does
the
rights
of
the
judiciary
ends,
and
where
does
the
rights
of
the
executive
begin.
and
i
cannot
see
it
in
the
128-line,
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
an
overlap
where
there
is
some
sort
of
a
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
we've
argued
that
in
brief
and
we
have
specifically
narrowed
it
in
our
brief.
now
amicus
is
filed
a
brief
which
purports
to
argue
that
certiorari
was
improvidently
granted,
i
would
adopt
that
argument.
and
i
will
not
devote
any
more
of
my
time
to
it
i
believe
it's
well
written
in
that
brief.
i
would
just
close
by
saying
that
this
court
many
years
ago
in
the
morton
salt
case,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
executive
officers
can
not
usurp
judicial
functions
nor
prevent
the
court
from
exercising
such
functions.
if
this
court
were
to
permit
the
parole
commission
under
the
peculiar
facts
in
this
case
to
hold
in
prison
messrs.
whelan
and
flaherty
any
longer
than
the
time
that
they've
already
served,
i
would
submit
that
they
have
usurped
the
judicial
function
and
that
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
do
so.
