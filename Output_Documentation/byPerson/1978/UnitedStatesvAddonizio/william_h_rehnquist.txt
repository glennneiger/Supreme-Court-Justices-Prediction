justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
the
phrase
of
legitimate
expectation
come
from
mr.
easterbrook?
is
it
a
property
right
or
liberty
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
judges
have
property
rights
and
liberty
rights
under
roth?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
edelson,
with
respect
to
2255,
did
judge
barlow
or
the
third
circuit
give
any
explanation
for
why
they
thought
this
was
a
sentence
subject
to
collateral
attack
in
view
of
our
holdings
in
murray
and
affronti?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i've
read
their
opinions
and
i'm
amazed
frankly
that
they
didn't
even
discuss
murray
or
affronti.
they
had
to
address
other
lower
court
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
did
murray
and
affronti
suggest
that
was
at
all
relevant,
whether
or
not
there'd
been
a
radical
change?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
maybe
congress
didn't
want
to
give
judge
barlow
the
power
either
to
guarantee
a
minimum
or
to
give
him
any
expectation
as
to
a
maximum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
fixing
the
higher
maximum.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
sentencing
statutes
about
giving
a
judge
any
expectation
as
to
a
maximum.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
before
we
have
your
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
the
fact
that
the
third
circuit
opinions
may
have
given
judge
barlow,
who
was
a
district
judge
in
new
jersey
an
expectation,
certainly
doesn't
bind
us
in
any
way,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
this
court
had
never
sustained
the
third
circuit's
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
judge
shaw's
right
survives
his
death?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
where
do
you
find
those
rights,
you
find
them
on
acts
of
congress,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
judge
could
impose
whatever
sentence
he
wanted
after
a
guilty
verdict
regardless
of
what
congress
had
said
about
it?
