mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
questions
about
the
allocation
of
authority
to
determine
how
long
a
convicted
prisoner
remains
in
jail.
it
presents
the
question
whether
a
district
court
can
reduce
a
lawful
sentence
if
the
judge
determines
that
a
decision
by
parole
authorities
frustrated
the
judge's
expectations
about
when
the
prisoner
would
be
released.
my
argument
has
a
number
of
strands
and
my
presentation
may
be
clearer
if
i
tell
you
now
where
i
intend
to
go
during
the
argument.
after
stating
the
case,
i
will
argue
three
propositions.
first,
there
has
not
been
any
dramatic
change
in
the
practices
of
parole
authorities
since
respondents
were
sentenced,
consequently,
no
ones
expectation
should
have
been
frustrated.
my
second
proposition
is
that
any
subjective
expectations
of
the
judge
that
were
frustrated
in
fact
were
not
legitimate
expectations
because
courts
never
had
a
right
to
insist
or
even
expect
that
the
parole
commission
would
exercise
its
discretion
in
any
particular
way
so
that
release
would
take
place
at
a
particular
time.
the
third
proposition
is
that
even
if
judges
had
some
legitimate
expectations
about
the
date
of
release,
they
are
not
entitled
to
insist
that
the
parole
commission
conform
its
behavior
to
those
expectations.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
and
my
point
then
is
that
there
is
no
collateral
remedy
for
that
sort
of
thing.
that
there's
no
collateral
limit
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
nonetheless,
that's
the
sense
in
which
i
intend
to
present.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--
legitimate
has
been
used
in
roth.
it's
been
used
in
cases
like
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
don't
want
to
argue
that
judges
have
liberty
or
property
rights
under
roth.
they're
not
vindicating
their
own
rights,
although
there
is
a
strong
under
current
in
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case
that
this
case
is
all
about
the
rights
of
judges.
that
this
is
about
the
right
of
judges
to
insist
on
release
at
a
particular
time
and
that
it
frustrates
the
legitimate
expectations
of
judges
to
do
anything
else.
and
in
that
sense,
argument
about
legitimate
expectations
and
the
like
responds
to
what
the
third
circuit
was
talking
about.
but
i'd
like
to
begin
with
a
short
statement
of
the
facts.
addonizio
was
the
mayor
of
newark
between
1962
and
1970.
in
1970
he
was
convicted
of
63
counts
of
extortion,
essentially
of
conspiring
with
members
of
organized
crime
to
sell
for
money
his
performance
of
governmental
services.
the
maximum
sentence
on
these
convictions
exceeded
1000
years
in
jail.
judge
barlow
said
that
addonizio
had
committed,
and
i
quote
“crimes
of
monumental
proportion,
the
enormity
of
which
can
scarcely
be
exaggerated.”
and
he
said
“these
were
no
ordinary
--“
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
this
was
in
1970
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
when
mayor
addonizio
was
convicted.
he
said
these
were
no
ordinary
criminal
acts
but
instead
were,
and
i
again
quote
from
page
10
of
the
appendix,
“brazen,
callous
and
contemptuous
of
the
law.”
the
judge
then
sentenced
addonizio
to
10
years
in
jail
and
said
not
one
word
about
his
expectations
of
release
on
parole.
the
parole
commission
essentially
took
the
judge
at
his
word
and
concluded
that
addonizio
was
no
ordinary
criminal.
the
commission
decided
that
because
of
the
magnitude
and
organized
nature
of
the
crimes,
addonizio
should
serve
approximately
six
years
of
the
10-year
sentence
in
this
case.
at
the
end
of
which,
he
would
be
released
mandatorily
on
good
time
credits.
judge
barlow
responded
to
this
decision
by
reducing
the
sentence
from
ten
years
to
five,
stating
that
the
commission's
decision
had
frustrated
his
expectation
that
addonizio
would
be
released
after
three
to
four
years.
first,
the
commission
had
decided
to
hold
addonizio
longer,
judge
barlow
said
it
was
necessary
to
reduce
his
sentence
to
achieve
earlier
release.
the
cases
of
whelan
and
flaherty
are
much
the
same.
they
were
officials
of
jersey
city
convicted
of
27
counts
of
extortion,
against
selling
governmental
services
for
private
gain.
they
were
sentenced
to
15
years
in
prison
and
they
sought
reduction
of
their
sentences
when
it
appeared
that
the
parole
commission
would
hold
them
for
a
little
more
than
seven
years
before
they
are
released.
judge
biunno
denied
relief
finding
that
release
would
frustrate
the
sentencing
intentions
of
judge
shaw
who
imposed
the
sentence.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
who
is
deceased.
judge
barlow
was
also
deceased
now.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
third
circuit
affirmed
in
addonizio
case
and
reversed
in
whelan's
and
flaherty's,
and
it
gave
two
principle
reasons
for
holding
that
district
judges
have
authority
to
reduce
their
sentences
in
response
to
parole
decisions.
first,
it
said,
because
judges
have
almost
unlimited
authority
to
set
a
maximum
term
in
imprisonment,
it
must
follow
that
the
judge's
expectations
about
the
actual
time
to
be
served
should
be
vindicated
to
the
fullest
possible
extent.
a
change
in
the
commission's
approach
to
release
decisions
ha
thwarted
the
judge's
ability
to
achieve
release
at
a
particular
time
the
third
circuit
reasoned,
and
so
the
only
way
that
judges
could
vindicate
their
expectations
and
achieve
release
was
to
shorten
sentences.
the
second
argument
that
the
court
gave
was
that
traditional
standards
of
criminal
justice
reject
the
imposition
of
double
punishment.
it
found
double
punishment
here
because
both
the
district
judge
and
the
parole
commission
had
taken
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
its
severity
into
account
in
making
their
decisions.
underlying
much
of
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
and
all
of
the
arguments
of
respondents
is
the
contention
that
in
1973,
the
parole
officials
radically
changed
their
approach
to
making
parole
decisions.
until
1973,
they
thought
well
behaved
prisoners
could
expect
to
be
released
after
serving
approximately
one-third
of
their
sentences.
after
november
1973,
this
was
no
longer
true,
they
argued.
judges
had
imposed
sentences,
they
thought,
in
the
expectation
that
there
would
be
release
after
one-third
so
that
they
could
achieve
and
easily
predict
the
date
of
release
simply
by
sentencing
defendants
to
three
times
as
much
as
they
really
wanted
them
to
serve.
and
then,
when
the
commission
rudely
surprised
everyone
by
changing
its
policy
requiring
some
people
to
serve
more
than
a
third,
the
argument
runs,
judges
were
entitled
to
revise
their
sentences
to
bring
the
actual
time
to
be
served
back
in
line
with
what
they
had
in
mind
to
begin
with.
the
same
argument
i
assume,
would
apply
whenever
the
parole
commission
changes
its
policies
or
its
guidelines,
a
practice
that
now
occurs
every
six
months
to
every
year
as
a
result
of
hearing
some
continuing
oversight
of
parole
practices.
but
this
argument
really
doesn't
hang
together.
it
fails
on
a
number
of
points.
it
assumes
first,
that
there
was
a
radical
change
of
policy,
there
was
not.
it
assumes
that
judges
were
entitled
to
set
sentences
in
a
way
that
achieves
definite
release
dates,
they
were
not.
and
it
assumes
that
there's
a
statutory
source
of
authority
to
resentence
a
defendant
if
the
original
plan
goes
array,
there
is
not.
and
i
will
start
with
the
argument
that
there
has
been
a
radical
change
in
parole
criteria
sometime
between
1970
and
the
present.
first
place
to
start
on
that
score
seems
to
me
is
what
the
statutes
that
allocate
authority
between
judges
and
the
commission.
the
basic
statutes
allocating
authority
are
unchanged
between
1970
and
today.
the
principal
statutes
prohibit
judges
from
setting
a
minimum
term
of
imprisonment
of
more
than
one-third
of
the
maximum.
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
the
commission
retains
substantial
discretion
between
one-third
and
the
mandatory
release
date
on
accumulated
good
time
credits.
another
statute,
the
statute
dealing
with
probation,
prohibits
split
sentences.
it's
a
statute
in
which
congress
is
very
careful.
when
a
term
of
imprisonment
is
combined
with
a
sentence
of
probation,
the
imprisonment
component
cannot
exceed
six
months,
and
the
effect
of
this
is
that
a
judge
can't
divide
up
release
supervision
with
imprisonment
in
a
way
that
sets
a
release
date
at
any
distance
in
the
future.
there
is
another
statute,
18
u.s.c.
4218
(d)
which
provides
that
release
decisions
are
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law,
which
effectively
prohibits
any
judicial
review
even
on
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
of
decisions
of
the
parole
commission
about
actual
release
dates.
and
there
is
one
more
rule
which
allocates
authority.
this
court
held
in
the
affronti
and
murray
cases
that
a
judge
cannot
reduce
a
sentence
after
service
has
commenced
even
if
he
discovers
that
the
sentence
was
a
mistake,
which
was
the
case
in
murray.
that
rule
has
been
changed
by
a
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
35,
but
only
by
giving
the
court
authority
for
120
days,
and
the
120
marks
the
dividing
line
between
the
authority
of
courts
and
the
authority
of
the
commission
under
the
statutes,
all
those
have
remained
constant
throughout
this
litigation.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
a
judge
could
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor
he
could
not
say
three
to
seven,
because
three
is
more
than
one-third
of
seven,
he
could
say
two
to
seven
for
example.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
he
could
say
that
he
wants
the
commission
to
release
him
at
the
end
of
four
years.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
commission
is
now
required
by
statute
to
consider
what
the
judge
says
in
that
respect.
there's
an
explicit
statue
providing
that
judges
can
give
the
commission
recommendations
and
requiring
the
commission
to
consider
them.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
that
sense
its
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
your
honor
he
can't,
he
has
no
authority
to
require
him
to
be
held.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
at
the
end
of
one-third
of
the
sentence,
the
parole
commission
can
release
him
not
withstanding
the
judge's
desires
and
expectations.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case
is
that
if
you
credit
the
third
circuit's
view
that
the
commission
cannot
consider
the
nature
and
seriousness
of
the
offense,
the
parole
commission
would
presumably
be
prohibited
from
releasing
someone
early
in
the
sentence
on
the
ground
that
the
crime
was
trivial
and
the
defendant
didn't
deserve
to
stay
in
jail.
because
that
entire
field
is
prohibited
by
the
third
circuit's
decision,
it
cuts
both
ways.
in
any
event,
the
commission
in
1970
at
the
time
of
the
sentences
here
faced
substantial
pressure
for
change.
it
was
under
criticism
from
the
administrative
conference
from
respected
scholars
such
as
professor
davis
and
from
others,
who
contended
that
it
was
making
arbitrary
decisions
without
published
standards
and
so
on.
and
there
was
substantial
desire
on
the
commission's
part
and
the
academic
and
administrative
law
of
community
that
the
commission
do
something
else.
what
it
did
was
to
cooperate
with
the
national
council
on
crime
and
delinquency
to
study
its
own
procedures.
persons
sat
in
at
hearings
that
were
being
conducted
by
the
commission
and
tried
to
figure
out
what
the
commission
was
doing
in
fact.
the
study
found
that
commission's
decisions
could
be
explained
most
adequately
if
you
knew
three
kinds
of
things.
if
you
knew
the
nature
and
seriousness
of
the
offense,
if
you
knew
his
release
prospects
that
is,
how
likely
he
was
to
commit
new
crimes
if
released,
and
if
you
knew
something
about
his
prison
behavior.
and
of
those
two,
the
nature
and
seriousness
of
the
offense
and
his
release
prospects
were
the
most
important.
these
findings
became
the
basis
for
the
system
of
guidelines
which
the
commission
adapted
in
1973
which
allowed
you
to
look
up
in
the
table
some
range
of
dates,
for
example
26
to
35
months
within
which
approximately
80%
of
people
of
a
particular
offense
seriousness
and
a
particular
release
prognosis
could
expect
to
serve.
what
the
commission
was
trying
to
do
there
was
to
regularize
its
decisions
to
prevent
what
had
been
perceived
as
arbitrary
erratic
and
unexplained
decisions,
and
in
no
small
measure
to
control
its
own
hearing
examiners
because
parole
policy
is
supposed
to
be
made
by
the
commissioners,
rather
than
by
the
hearing
examiners.
and
if
the
commission
didn't
have
published
criteria,
how
could
the
hearing
examiners
know
what
to
do?
what
happened
in
1973,
at
least
what
the
commission
intended
happened
in
1973,
was
the
that
the
release
criteria
that
had
been
used
all
along
become
visible
and
routine,
rather
than
invisible
and
sporadic.
there's
substantial
confirmation
for
the
commission's
view
of
what
it
was
doing.
no
one
should've
thought
in
1970
that
there
was
presumptive
release
at
the
end
of
one-third
of
the
sentence.
the
statute
in
effect
in
1970
which
we've
quoted
at
note
14
on
page
27
of
our
brief
said
that
the
commission
acquired
discretion
to
release
someone
only
if
it
found
two
things
first.
one
was
that
rehabilitation,
or
it
was
a
rehabilitation
welfare
criteria
essentially.
and
the
second
dealt
with
the
welfare
of
society.
the
latter,
we
think,
included
considerations
of
general
deterrence,
just
dissert
and
so
on
or
at
least
the
commission
so
interpreted
them.
but
even
if
a
prisoner
could
show
that
he
was
rehabilitated
and
that
release
was
not
incompatible
with
the
welfare
of
society,
what
the
statute
then
provided
was
“the
commission
may
in
its
discretion
elect
to
grant
parole.”
in
other
words,
it
had
absolutely
unbridled
discretion.
nothing
in
the
statute
could've
supported
an
inference
or
a
belief
that
there
was
an
entitlement
to
release
after
one-third
of
the
sentence.
the
commission,
during
the
period
at
issue
here,
repeatedly
said
that
it
took
offense
severity
into
account,
and
that's
discussed
at
pages
51
to
53
of
our
brief
in
which
we
reproduced
some
of
the
statements
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
the
others
of
the
commissioners.
if
anyone
had
a
contrary
expectation
about
what
the
commission
was
doing,
it
was
invented.
it
wasn't
derived
from
what
the
commission
said.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
precisely.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
commission's
deeds
comported
with
its
words,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
the
1970
parole
commission
by
any
of
a
report
which
collects
figures
from
1966
to
1970,
so
a
report
of
the
release
decisions
over
that
period.
table
10
of
the
report,
which
appears
at
page
20,
describes
release
decisions
and
according
to
the
table
of
all
adult
prisoners,
only
45.5%
were
ever
released
on
parole.
that
is
more
than
half
of
all
adult
prisoners
were
held
until
mandatory
exploration.
those
figures
speak
i
think
quite
loudly
about
the
absence
of
any
presumption
of
release
at
the
one-third
point.
we've
also
collected
at
page
47,
excuse
me,
at
note
47
of
our
brief,
some
data
that
were
assembled
by
the
commission
on
crime
and
delinquency,
the
same
commission
that
conducted
the
study
that
lead
to
the
guidelines.
and
those
data
show
that
almost,
if
you
can
find
the
sample
to
first
offenders
who
were
sentenced
to
more
than
a
year,
approximately
30%
of
that
group
was
continued
to
exploration
of
the
sentence
in
1970,
that
particular
year
the
year
of
the
sentence
of
mr.
addonizio.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it's
true.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
data
in
this
brief
contain
only
people
who
were
eligible
for
release
on
parole,
that's
my
understanding.
that's
one
reason
why
the
--
not
only
were
they
excluded
but
it
was
also
necessary
to
set
--
to
select
the
class
of
prisoners
who
were
serving
more
than
a
year,
because
under
statute
prisoners
sentenced
to
a
year
or
less
are
not
eligible
for
parole.
they're
just
held
and
released
on
good
time.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
the
first
offenders
are
in
the
first
paragraph
in
the
note
of
page
47.
the
parole
commission's
published
table
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
note
47
on
page
55
of
our
brief,
first
paragraph
does
try
to
breakdown
into
first
offenders,
distinguishes
first
offenders
from
all
offenders.
the
parole
commission
state,
which
is
at
page
20
table
10
of
the
biannual
report
for
the
years
in
question,
does
not
break
it
down
that
way.
you
can't
get
a
breakdown
of
first
offenders
in
that
table.
by
looking
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
in
fact
that
was
pointed
out
that
we
haven't
been
sufficiently
precise
by
respondent
addonizio.
the
data
apparently
deal
with
releases
within
two
months
of
the
one-third
point.
if
you
are
released
within
two
months
of
one-third,
you're
treated
as
being
released
at
one-third.
release
is
more
than
two
months
after
one-third
are
being
treated
as
after
one-third.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
reason
for
the
two-month
gap
is
because
many
people
didn't
have
their
hearings
until
very
close
to
the
one-third
point
and
couldn't
be
released
for
some
period
afterwards.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
some
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
--
yes
your
honor
that
was
the
reason
for
the
allowance
of
the
two
months,
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
parole
commission
believes
it
is.
i
must
examine
the
data
myself.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
there
was.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
with
the
exception
of
persons
sentenced
to
under
what's
now
the
v2
sentence.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
persons
who
are
eligible
for
parole
at
the
outset.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
some
people
as
the
data
show
got
released
at
the
allegedly
meaningless
first
hearing.
they
were
released
almost
right
away.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
many
events
because
the
commission
thought
the
crime
was
trivial,
and
there
was
a
policy
of
winning
them
out.
but
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--
that
did
happen.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
was.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
oh
yes!
oh
yes,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
it
comes
tolerably
close
to
40%
or
50%
of
all
prisoners
who
have
a
hearing
got
released
right
then.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
that
is
i
think
still
the
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
in
1970
a
judge
could
reasonably
have
anticipated
that
a
substantial
proportion
of
all
prisoners
with
good
institutional
behavior
would
be
released
near
that
time.
the
question
is
whether
he
could
reasonably
have
expected
that
the
substantial
proportion
was
not
simply
50%,
60%
or
the
like,
but
would
include
persons
like
mr.
addonizio.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
even
in
1970
there
was,
if
you
can
visualize
a
bell
shaped
curve,
there
surely
a
tail
off
toward
the
more
serious
end.
somebody
has
to
fit
in
that
tail
even
in
1970
and
the
commission
had
to
have
it
then
as
it
still
does
filling
that
group
with
persons
like
mr.
addonizio
whose
crimes
are
really
quite
severe
or
are
perceived
as
quite
severe
by
the
commission
as
well
as
by
the
judge.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
the
government
prevails
here,
mr.
justice
brennan,
his
original
10-year
sentence
will
be
restored.
the
commission's
practice
has
been
in
cases
of
this
sort,
and
it
has
informed
me
that
it
will
follow
the
practice
here
of
giving
the
prisoner
another
hearing
before
he
is
returned
to
prison.
in
many
of
the
cases
in
which
someone
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
did
and
he
had
served
five
years
and
two
months.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
challenged
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
so
that
if
we
prevail
here,
judge
barlow's
order
will
be
set
aside
and
his
sentence
restored
to
10
years.
the
commission
will
then
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
has
been
out
for
a
little
more
than
two
years
now.
and
in
light
of
that
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
the
--
judge
barlow
released
him,
the
third
circuit
ordered
him
to
return
to
jail
and
the
supreme
court,
by
vote
of
7
to
2,
ordered
him
released
again.
but
before
the
commission
would
order
him
to
serve
any
additional
portion
of
its
sentence,
it
would
hold
an
additional
hearing
to
take
into
account
what's
happened
in
the
two
years
since
he's
been
released.
and
my
understanding
of
other
cases
in
which
district
judges
have
ordered
persons
to
be
released
and
the
commission
has
then
prevailed
on
appeal
in
the
first
and
the
eight,
and
the
eight
and
several
of
the
other
circuits
that
had
had
this
kind
of
litigation
going
on,
has
been
that
a
substantial
number
of
the
persons
are
not
returned
to
prison
but
are
continued
on
parole.
that
judgment
will
be
for
the
commission
to
make
in
all
three
cases
here.
but
even
if
i'm
wrong
in
all
of
this,
and
if
you
grant
that
there
was
a
change
in
policy,
i
think
it
clear
from
the
network
of
statutes
and
rules
that
we
have
been
discussing
that
congress
gave
the
commission
the
power
to
establish
a
parole
policy,
and
that
its
exercise
of
a
parole
policy,
its
change
of
parole
policy,
is
not
something
that
can
lead
to
resentencing.
when
a
prisoner
is
sentenced,
he
is
subjected
to
the
commission's
discretion,
that's
exactly
the
meaning
of
a
sentence
that
gives
the
commission
authority
between
the
one-third
point
and
the
end
of
the
sentence.
a
particular
use
of
that
discretion
is,
we
submit,
not
a
ground
for
complaint,
even
if
ten
years
ago,
the
commission
would
have
exercised
its
discretion
in
a
different
way.
a
judge
can
object
to
the
consequences
of
that
kind
of
change
only
if
he
had
some
legitimate
ability
to
control
the
time
of
release.
but
it's
exactly
that
ability
to
control
the
time
of
release
that
congress
denied
the
judges.
the
third
circuit's
general
view,
which
is
that
because
judges
have
absolute
control
over
the
maximum
time
to
be
served,
they
must
have
control
over
the
actual
time
to
be
served.
it's
a
classic
non-secular.
it's
nothing
but
disagreement
with
the
statutory
policy
giving
one
branch
of
government
authority
over
the
maximum
and
another
branch
of
government
authority
over
the
actual
time
to
be
served.
it's
almost
inevitable
that
that
kind
of
process
is
going
to
produce
frustration.
judges
may
well
believe,
and
legitimately
so,
that
a
particular
prisoner
should
be
released
after
four
years.
given
the
statutory
framework,
there
is
no
way
he
can
hand
down
the
sentence
saying
“hold
this
man
for
four
years
and
then
release
him.”
the
judge
must
attempt
to
approximate,
but
his
inability
to
predict
correctly
the
error
and
success
of
approximations
is,
we
submit,
not
anything
that
entitles
the
judge
to
claim
the
very
power
that
congress
withheld,
the
power
to
set
a
precise
release
date.
my
final
argument
is
that
i
could
be
wrong
in
that
too,
and
respondents
still
aren't
entitled
to
relief.
no
statute
authorizes
a
court
to
review
sentences
in
response
to
frustration
of
sentencing
judges,
even
if
the
frustrations
and
the
judge's
expectations
were
legitimate.
this
court's
decisions
in
affronti
and
murray
established
that
courts
can
not
reduce
sentences
after
their
service
has
commenced.
and
rule
35
mitigates
that
only
to
the
extent
that
establishing
a
line
of
demarcation
at
120
days
after
the
judgment,
rather
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
sentence.
court
of
appeals
held
that
section
2255
supplies
a
residual
source
of
authority
to
revise
sentences.
this
we
think
is
incorrect.
that
very
proposition
was
implicitly
rejected
in
murray
and
affronti,
but
more
than
that,
the
court
of
appeals
position
overlooks
the
limits
on
the
scope
of
collateral
review.
as
this
court
held
in
davis,
collateral
review
in
nonconstitutional
or
in
cases
of
nonconstitutional
defects
is
available
only
when
necessary
to
avoid
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
but
all
that
happened
here
is
that
respondents
lawfully
sentenced
to
substantial
terms
of
imprisonment,
had
been
required
to
continue
service
of
those
terms.
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it,
we
think,
continued
service
of
a
lawful
term
of
imprisonment
is
not
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
respondents
here
should
be
treated
no
differently
than
other
persons
who
are
held
in
jail
after
the
judge
believes
they
should
be
released.
there
maybe
circumstances,
for
example
a
religious
conversion
of
a
prisoner
that
would
lead
a
judge
to
believe
that
his
sentence
had
become
wildly
inappropriate.
and
yet
it
seems
clear
that
the
release
discretion
at
that
point
is
entrusted
to
the
commission
or
perhaps
to
the
president,
rather
than
to
a
continuing
supervisory
authority
of
the
courts.
we
think
that
a
court
at
that
point
cannot
claim
to
use
section
2255
to
produce
the
result
that
is
otherwise
forbidden.
and
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
submit,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
has
never
been
such
a
claim
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
did
not,
nor
to
murray.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
believe
it
was
your
honor.
