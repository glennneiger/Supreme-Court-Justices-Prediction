both
of
these
cases
they
have
special
interest
to
people
from
nevada
and
california
although
the
two
cases
are
unrelated.
the
principle
question
in
the
first
of
the
case
is
number
77-1327
is
whether
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
which
was
created
by
a
compact
between
the
states
of
california
and
nevada
is
entitled
to
claim
the
same
immunity
from
suit
in
a
federal
court
that
the
states
themselves
have
under
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
agency
is
immune
from
suit
and
further
held
that
when
the
members
of
the
agencyâ€™s
governing
body
are
performing
legislative
acts,
they
are
entitled
to
the
same
immunity
as
state
legislators.
today,
we
unanimously
hold
that
the
regional
planning
agency
does
not
have
the
same
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment
as
the
states
do.
and
by
vote
of
six
to
three,
we
hold
that
the
individual
defendants
have
a
personal
immunity
comparable
to
that
of
state
legislators.
on
the
latter
issue,
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
we
therefore
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
