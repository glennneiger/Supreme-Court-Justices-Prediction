justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
man
charge
with
a
first
degree
murder
and
if
he
sticks
to
a
not
guilty
plea,
you'll
be
trialed
by
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
his
lawyer
and
the
prosecutor
talking
and
becomes
clear
the
prosecutor
would
end
up
recommending
20
years
if
he
plead
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
isn't
that
just
the
same
and
in
senate
to
disregard
his
jury
right,
where
the
same
burden
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
the
same
--
it
seems
the
same
--
it's
the
same
burden
in
the
sense
that
he's
got
and
he
has
to
make
up
his
mind
about
which
the
alternative,
which
decorum
to
jump
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
prosecutor
says
i'll
never
recommend
20
years
if
you
obviously
under
this
law
and
i'll
never
recommend
20
years
if
you'd
go
to
trial,
that's
your
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
structures
the
limits
and
structures
the
bargain.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
grant
you
but
it
does
that
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
smith,
i
gather
that
new
jersey
still
uses
in
the
murder
indictment
to
your
common
law
form
just
willfully
following
mislead
of
malice
support
so
on
and
so
forth.
it
says
nothing
whatever
in
the
indictment
itself
that
it's
a
felony.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
why
going
back
to
your
answer
to
my
brother
stewart,
that's
why
you
you'll
say
when
he
pleads.
he
doesn't
plead
to
felony
murder.
he
pleads
to
that
common
law
indictment
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
fact
that
it
was
a
felony
murder
simply
comes
out
in
his
admission
as
to
the
conduct
which
constituted
the
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
case
i
have
to
announce
is
mcarthur
corbitt
against
the
state
of
new
jersey,
number
77-5903.1
this
case
involves
a
new
jersey
conviction
for
first-degree
murder,
which
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
mcarthur
corbitt
asserts
it
is
invalid
because
of
the
peculiar
punishment
pattern
imposed
by
the
new
jersey
statutes.
in
new
jersey,
the
mandatory
punishment
for
a
defendant
found
guilty
by
a
jury
of
first-degree
murder
is
life
imprisonment.
second-degree
murder
is
punishable
by
a
prison
term
of
up
to
30
years.
those
charged
with
murder
however
are
permitted
to
tender
a
plea
of
non
vult
which
is
somewhat
like
a
plea
of
guilty.
if
the
plea
is
accepted,
judgment
of
conviction
follows
and
the
defendant
is
subject
to
a
sentence
of
either
life
imprisonment
or
a
prison
term
up
to
30
years.
because
life
imprisonment
is
mandatory
if
a
defendant
goes
to
trial
and
has
found
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
as
corbitt
was
whereas
there
is
the
possibility
of
a
much
lesser
sentence
if
it
plea
is
offered
and
accepted.
corbitt
claims
that
the
statutory
pattern
is
designed
to
encourage
guilty
pleas
and
that
is
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
is
nothing
more
than
an
impermissible
punishment
for
his
refusal
to
plead
non
vult
and
for
his
insistence
on
a
jury
trial.
all
in
violation
he
says
of
his
rights
under
the
fifth,
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
rejected
these
claims
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
we
have
filed
today,
we
agree
with
the
new
jersey
court.
new
jersey
has
not
reserved
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
for
those
who
go
to
trial
in
murder
cases.
that
sentence
may
also
be
imposed
by
a
judge
who
accepts
a
plea
of
non
vult.
and
under
our
cases
particularly
those
involving
plea
bargaining,
a
state
does
not
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
well
counseled
defendant
as
corbitt
was
simply
because
it
holds
out
the
possibility
or
probability
of
a
lesser
punishment
if
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
and
the
judgment
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
only.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
dissented
and
he
is
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall.
