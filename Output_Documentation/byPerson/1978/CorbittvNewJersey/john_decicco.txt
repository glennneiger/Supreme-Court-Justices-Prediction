mr.
john
decicco
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
new
jersey
statutory
sentencing
scheme
for
murder
impermissible
infringes
upon
a
defendant's
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
to
trial.
a
subsidiary
question
is
whether
the
statutory
scheme
at
issue
deprives
an
accused
of
equal
protection
of
he
laws.
it
is
our
position
that
new
jersey's
homicide
statute
deny
in
anyway
burden
those
wishing
to
exercise
their
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
to
defend
against
murder
charges
before
a
jury
nor
do
our
statutes
deprive
those
individuals
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
at
the
outset,
we
recognize
and
emphasize
that
if
the
sole
objective
and
result
of
state
legislation
is
to
unnecessarily
discourage
the
assertion
of
constitutional
rights
then
the
statutory
scheme
is
patently
unconstitutional.
however,
this
case
involves
nothing
more
than
a
statutory
codification
of
plea
bargaining
in
homicide
cases
and
nothing
else.
even
assuming
any
form
of
an
inducement
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
no
chilling
effect
on
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
when
three
criteria
have
been
met.
one,
the
statutory
scheme
serves
a
necessary
and
legitimate
state
interest
and/or
interest
to
a
defendant
which
is
present
here.
mr.
john
decicco
the
interest
is
to
conserve
scarce
traditional
and
prosecutorial
resources.
secondly,
the
interest
is
to
facilitate
the
correctional
process
with
respect
for
the
specific
offender.
the
interest
runs
both
ways.
mr.
john
decicco
that
is
correct
and
that
correct
--
mr.
john
decicco
well,
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
a
sole
accomplishment.
it
allows
him
to
avoid
the
readers
of
life
imprisonment.
it
allows
the
defendant
to
realize
his
--
mr.
john
decicco
yes,
it
does.
a
non
vult
provision
does.
mr.
john
decicco
yes,
he
might
and
even
avoided
there.
should
he
be
acquitted,
should
he
be
convicted
of
a
lesser
degree
of
homicide.
secondly,
if
the
statutory
goals
are
unobtainable
through
any
other
means
then
this
court
has
upheld
statutory
scheme
such
as
the
present
and
third
and
i
think
most
important
is
that
any
inducement
--
mr.
john
decicco
it
has
upheld
statutory
and
or
tom
law
schemes
whereby
the
goals
are
unobtainable
through
any
other
--
mr.
john
decicco
not
an
statutory
scheme
but
in
bordenkircher
--
mr.
john
decicco
no.
excuse
me.
a
bordenkircher
have
held
the
prosecutorial
and
the
plea
negotiation
system
whereby
the
same
result
was
obtained.
in
striking
the
balance
with
relation
to
these
three
components
of
our
equation,
it
is
submitted
that
the
new
jersey
homicide
statutes
are
beyond
constitutional
attack.
indeed,
appellant
has
failed
to
demonstrate
any
measurable
incidents
of
defendants
who
have
been
needlessly
chilled
in
their
exercise
of
their
fifth
and/or
sixth
amendment
rights
to
trial.
initially,
and
considering
the
extent
of
any
chilling
effect
purportedly
exerted
on
our
homicide
statutes
reference
to
the
united
states
versus
jackson
is
helpful.
there
of
course,
a
defendant
who
proceeded
to
jury
trial
would
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty
while
the
defendant
who
chose
any
other
means
of
either
admitting
his
guilt
or
going
to
trial
would
be
eligible
for
something
less
than
the
death
penalty.
the
new
jersey
statute
--
mr.
john
decicco
in
jackson,
the
maximum
permitted
was
greater
should
he
choose
to
go
to
trial
then
the
maximum
and
under
the
new
jersey
statutory
scheme.
we
think
that
is
significant.
mr.
john
decicco
generally
speaking,
i
would
say
there
is
no
material
difference
when
you're
speaking
of
disparity
minimum
sentences
because
that
is
an
essence
what
all
plea
bargaining
is
about.
a
defendant
who
chooses
not
to
go
to
trial
generally
not
always,
generally
will
receive
a
lesser
term
of
incarceration,
i.e.
a
lesser
minimum
where
is
that
if
the
defendant
goes
to
trial
may
receive
a
greater
term
of
incarceration.
mr.
john
decicco
that
is
one
of
our
distinctions
of
jackson,
yes.
i
would
also
note
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
two
different
forms
of
conviction.
a
conviction
for
non
vult
murder
is
to
a
general
short
form
murder
indictment
in
new
jersey
some
specified
as
to
what
in
fact
the
defendant
has
plead
guilty
to
other
than
the
general
category
of
murder
whereas
in
having
been
trialed
for
first
degree
murder
and
having
been
convicted.
there's
a
specific
designation
which
the
legislature
has
determined
should
be
penalize
by
a
mandatory
term
of
life
imprisonment.
the
distinction
that
we
would
like
to
first
draw
with
jackson
is
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
present
here
whereas
it
was
there
and
in
fact
it
wasn't.
it
was
a
greater
maximum
then
under
the
new
jersey
statutory
scheme.
this
court
has
recognized
even
in
jackson
and
most
recently
in
united
states
--
in
lockett
versus
ohio
that
the
death
penalty
is
qualitatively
different
from
mere
imprisonment.
mr.
john
decicco
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
john
decicco
because
i
think
that
in
jackson
and
in
death
generally,
whenever
we
are
talking
about
that,
we
are
talking
about
the
extent
of
the
encouragement.
i
believe
this
court
in
jackson
use
the
freed
needless
encouragement
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
at
this
point
of
the
argument
is
to
demonstrate
that
doing
a
way
with
the
potential
for
death
does
a
way
greatly
if
not
in
fact
altogether
with
the
extent
of
any
unnecessary
inducement,
any
chilling
effect.
secondly,
and
a
i've
already
mention
more
significantly
is
the
fact
that
a
defendant
in
new
jersey
is
subject
to
the
same
maximum
sentence
life
imprisonment
regardless
of
whether
he
chooses
to
go
to
trial
or
to
plead
non
vult.
the
maximum
in
jackson
was
greater
since
death
was
only
available
for
trial
rights
were
asserted.
the
argument
that
has
been
raise
that
disparity
minimum
sentences
induce
the
defendant
to
forego
as
fifth
amendment
rights
does
not
take
into
account
are
plea
bargaining
practice
in
general
and
in
this
case
specifically
the
fact
that
the
defendant
who
does
proceed
to
trial
faces
various
alternatives
between
conviction
of
first
degree
murder,
conviction
of
second
degree
murder,
conviction
of
manslaughter
or
acquittal.
the
defendant
who
pleads
non
vult
also
has
various
alternatives
confronting
him
from
the
term
of
life
imprisonment
to
anything
less.
considering
--
mr.
john
decicco
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
trialed
to
the
jury
on
a
felony
murder
theory.
mr.
john
decicco
and
there
were
no
other
instructions
--
mr.
john
decicco
we
can't
--
i
would
not
and
all
i'll
assume
any
jury
nullification
in
this
case
either
he
was
going
to
be
convicted
or
he
is
going
to
be
acquitted.
mr.
john
decicco
felony
murder.
mr.
john
decicco
yes,
it
was,
that's
correct.
however
had
he
plead
that
would
not
be
so.
there
will
be
no
designation
as
to
the
extent
of
the
crime
to
which
he
had
pleaded.
mr.
john
decicco
i
think
the
statute
would
be
somewhat
different
from
this.
mr.
john
decicco
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical
--
may
i
--
we
are
talking
about
a
driving
offense
for
which
if
he
pleads
guilty
he
will
receive
no
term
of
incarceration
and
if
he
pleads
--
if
he
goes
to
trial
at
the
municipal
level
he
will
--
mr.
john
decicco
um-huh.
mr.
john
decicco
we
have
the
same
maximum.
we
--
mr.
john
decicco
i
think
it
would
be
an
essence
the
same
case
as
this.
mr.
john
decicco
yes.
mr.
john
decicco
yes,
that's
jackson.
if
the
maximum
is
greater
then
we
can
--
mr.
john
decicco
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
mr.
john
decicco
that's
correct.
mr.
john
decicco
it
would
be
the
same
case.
i
misunderstood
your
honor
--
mr.
john
decicco
yes.
mr.
john
decicco
yes.
there
maybe
come
a
time
when
statutory
scheme
is
so
disparate
between
the
--
let
us
say
in
your
example
if
it
were
a
10-day
or
a
10-year
prison
term
depending
upon
the
choice
in
that
situation
--
mr.
john
decicco
as
in
jackson
where
you
have
the
death
penalty
versus
a
mere
term
of
years.
perhaps,
you
would
find
a
needless
encouragement,
the
extent
of
the
encouragement
would
be
so
great
as
to
make
this
scheme
constitutionally
defective.
mr.
john
decicco
it
is
possible
even
if
the
maxima
is
same,
if
there
were
in
great
disparity.
mr.
john
decicco
we're
dealing
here
between
life
imprisonment
--
mr.
john
decicco
but
it's
already
been
indicated
the
first
parole
eligibly
--
mr.
john
decicco
the
minimum
could
be
zero
but
he
could
--
mr.
john
decicco
he
could
get
up
to
30
years.
mr.
john
decicco
it's
lesser
because
in
practical
terms,
a
murder
defendant
pleading
guilty
will
not
receive
a
non-custodial
term
or
a
fine
merely.
rather,
generally
we
are
bargaining
then
at
that
point
in
time
for
terms
of
years,
i.e.
25-30
or
whatever
the
case
maybe.
mr.
john
decicco
that's
correct.
he
maybe
acquit
and
again
i
--
mr.
john
decicco
yes,
that
was
during
the
jackson
case
but
again
he
didn't
face
the
same,
he
facing
greater
maximum
--
mr.
john
decicco
and
he
will
that
habitual
--
mr.
john
decicco
right.
mr.
john
decicco
yes.
mr.
john
decicco
in
jackson?
mr.
john
decicco
well,
we're
dealing
with
someone
who
was
convicted
by
a
jury.
mr.
john
decicco
no,
he
had
been
convicted
--
mr.
john
decicco
he
had
been
convicted
by
a
jury
and
this
court
officiated
the
death
penalty
in
that
case.
mr.
john
decicco
and
this
court
that
doesn't
help
me
out
--
mr.
john
decicco
--
help
me
out,
yes.
in
any
event,
i
think
it
should
be
made
clear
that
this
court
has
held
it
on
various
occasions
that
the
constitution
does
not
forbid
every
government
who
imposed
choice
in
a
criminal
process
that
may
have
the
potential
of
discouraging
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights.
while
to
this
point,
we
have
emphasized
that
the
quantum
of
the
encouragement
to
plead
non
vult
to
avoid
the
potential
of
life
imprisonment
is
miniscule.
we
would
also
want
to
emphasize
legitimate
benefits
which
are
attributable
to
the
new
jersey
statutory
scheme.
this
court
and
again
i
reiterate
the
plea
bargaining
theme
because
i
think
it's
so
very
significant
in
the
disposition
of
this
case.
this
court
has
previously
recognized
the
vitality
of
the
concept
to
plea
bargaining
as
a
necessary
component
to
the
criminal
justice
system.
in
most
plea
bargaining
situations,
the
defendant
must
determine
whether
to
exercise
his
right
to
plead
innocent
and
to
receive
a
possibly
or
an
all
probability
higher
sense
or
whether
to
forgo
his
right
to
contest
his
guilt
and
to
receive
an
all
probability
a
lesser
sense.
thus,
plea
bargaining
has
always
had
as
an
incidental
effect,
the
discouragement
of
a
defendant's
assertion
of
his
trial
rights.
this
court
has
held
that
to
this
imposition
of
this
difficult
choice
are
inevitable
attribute
of
the
plea
bargaining
system
and
in
this
regard
our
statutory
system
does
not
in
anyway
deviate
from
plea
bargaining
in
general.
the
benefits
of
the
non
vult
statutory
scheme
in
new
jersey
are
several.
it
benefits
the
defendant
involve
by
permitting
him
to
avoid
the
expense
and
hardship
of
a
trial.
it
assures
the
prompt
commencement
of
the
correctional
process.
statutory
plea
bargaining
enforce
the
defendant
the
possibility
of
ameliorating
the
rigors
of
life
imprisonment
which
is
perhaps
the
most
important
benefit
attributable
to
the
present
scheme.
mr.
john
decicco
and
there
is
absolutely
no
distinction
between
the
two.
and
it
must
also
we
emphasize
the
plea
bargaining
is
predicated
upon
the
concept
of
those
who
acknowledge
their
guilt
are
in
a
better
position
and
are
better
process
for
rehabilitation
and
should
be
given
consideration
on
that
account.
from
the
states'
viewpoint,
our
statutory
scheme
for
murder
conserves
scarce
traditional
and
prosecutorial
resources.
it
also
must
be
recognize
that
the
states
interest
are
serve
by
our
scheme
and
that
the
legislature
has
determine
that
a
conviction
for
this
specific
crime
of
first
degree
murder
should
carry
a
mandatory
term
of
life
imprisonment.
in
essence,
the
statutory
scheme
is
a
bilateral
scheme
rather
than
a
unilateral
scheme
as
has
been
advance
here
today.
mr.
john
decicco
yes,
they
are.
but
two
different
offenses
--
mr.
john
decicco
they
are.
mr.
john
decicco
one
is
a
conviction
to
murder
in
general
--
in
general
category
of
murder.
in
new
jersey,
our
murder
indictments
reflect
--
mr.
john
decicco
that
is
a
conviction
of
first
degree
murder
specifically.
mr.
john
decicco
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you
said
before
a
jury,
it's
exactly
it's
--
mr.
john
decicco
yes,
the
factual
--
mr.
john
decicco
no.
the
judge
does
--
mr.
john
decicco
the
judge
makes
his
--
mr.
john
decicco
the
judge
would
have
--
mr.
john
decicco
the
judge
of
course
would
determine
the
facts
of
the
case
these
are
the
gravity
and
the
heinous
nature
of
the
crime
in
determining
whether
to
impose
25
or
30
or
20
--
mr.
john
decicco
years,
yes.
but
again
we
must
also
take
into
consider
--
mr.
john
decicco
he
can't
have
a
trial
before
a
--
mr.
john
decicco
without
a
jury.
mr.
john
decicco
in
the
other
states,
yes.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
something
else
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
decicco
what
this
might
help
--
what
i
do
want
to
emphasize,
and
perhaps,
i
haven't
up
to
this
point
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
right
upon
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
have
his
non
vult
plea
accepted
by
the
judge
at
all.
mr.
john
decicco
the
judge
does
it,
a
discretionary
act
with
the
judge.
if
he
looks
at
the
facts
of
this
case
as
you've
indicated
for
actual
basis
must
be
laid
in
new
jersey
otherwise
a
plea
cannot
be
accepted
which
is
different
from
the
alfred
type
situation.
in
new
jersey,
the
factual
predicate
must
be
laid.
when
the
judge
sees
those
facts,
he
might
determine
not
to
accept
the
plea.
base
upon,
let
us
say
the
prosecutor
recommends
25
years
and
the
judge
will
think
to
himself
that
that
just
is
a
little
too
easy
visibly
the
facts
of
the
case.
also
significant
is
the
fact
that
in
new
jersey
under
our
present
statutory
scheme,
the
benefits
of
it
are
unavailable,
are
unobtainable
by
other
means.
elimination
of
the
mandatory
life
sentence
would
nullify
the
legislative
determination
that
they
did.
that
is
the
appropriate
penalty
for
first
degree
murder.
abolition
of
the
non
vult
plea
would
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
defendants
who
wish
to
acknowledge
their
guilt
and
to
properly
avail
themselves
of
less
harsh
treatment
by
immediately
commencing
the
rehabilitation
process.
thus,
in
our
view,
the
new
jersey
statutory
scheme
does
not
place
an
excessive
burden
or
in
fact
any
burden
upon
a
defendants
right
to
plead
not
guilty.
moreover,
the
scheme
is
justifying
necessary
and
legitimate
state
needs.
we
recognize
that
no
man
should
receive
an
additional
penalty
because
he
defends
against
the
charge
but
it
does
not
follow
that
one
who
acknowledges
his
guilt
should
not
be
given
consideration
on
that
account.
i
will
now
briefly
turn
to
the
equal
protection
argument
raised
in
this
case.
it
is
our
view
that
the
equal
protection
argument
does
--
the
issue
as
to
equal
protection
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
if
there
is
an
unconstitutional
compulsion
placed
upon
a
defendant's
fifth
and/or
sixth
amendment
rights,
this
case
would
of
course
be
dispose
off
on
jackson
grounds.
if
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment
then
it
follows
that
the
equal
protection
argument
would
equally
be
meritless.
we
submit
that
the
category
in
new
jersey
at
the
time
where
the
decision
whether
to
proceed
to
trial
or
to
plead
non
vult,
the
category
is
the
same.
you
have
one
category
that
is
indited
murderous
and
they
all
have
the
identical
choices.
and
so,
therefore,
there
is
no
equal
protection
argument
at
that
point
in
time.
if
the
appellant
argues
that
the
classes
do
not
come
into
existence
subsequent
to
conviction,
which
i
believe
appellant
does
argue,
that
also
must
fall
because
at
that
point.
we
have
two
classes,
we
do
not
have
one
but
two
classes
and
they
are
those
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
murder
and
those
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
for
which
the
legislature
determine
a
life
imprisonment
penalty
and
so
that
under
either
alternative
or
theory,
the
equal
protection
argument
would
be
non-existing.
lastly,
even
assuming
a
cognizable
class
for
purposes
of
the
equal
protection
argument,
in
our
view
the
argument
must
fall.
we
have
it
in
new
jersey
a
legitimate
and
indeed
compelling
state
interest
in
fostering
the
statutory
scheme
which
we
have
mentioned
here
today.
these
are
to
repeat,
amelioration
of
the
rigors
of
life
imprisonment,
recognition
of
the
rehabilitative
prospects
by
one
going
to
admit
his
guilt,
the
ability
to
avoid
trial,
facilitation
of
plea
negotiations,
the
conservation
of
scarce
judicial
and
prosecutorial
resources,
and
prompt
the
position
of
a
punishment
of
offenders.
suffice
it
to
say,
the
benefits
included
by
defendants
in
the
state
demonstrate
that
the
equal
protection
argument
is
meritless.
thank
you
for
your
attention
to
our
argument.
