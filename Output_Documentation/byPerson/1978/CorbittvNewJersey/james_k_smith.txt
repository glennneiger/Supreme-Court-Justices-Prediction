mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
the
present
case
are
the
sentencing
provisions
of
the
new
jersey
murder
statute.
it
is
our
position
that
that
statute
penalizes
the
defendant's
right
to
jury
trial
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
as
applied
to
the
states
to
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
also
our
position
that
that
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
creating
a
discriminatory
classification.
in
effect,
there
are
two
penalties
for
the
crime
of
first
degree
or
felony
murder
in
new
jersey
depending
solely
upon
whether
the
defendant
has
exercise
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
if
the
defendant
is
willing
to
enter
a
non
vult
plea
to
an
indictment
for
murder
then
i
should
stop
for
the
moment
and
indicate
that
in
new
jersey,
we
do
not
allow
guilty
pleas
to
the
crime
of
murder.
a
defendant
must
enter
a
plea
of
either
non
vult
or
nolo
contendere
both
of
which
are
basically
the
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
no.
in
fact,
that
the
common
practices
for
all
pleas
to
be
entered
as
non
vult
pleas.
if
that
defendant
enters
a
non
vult
plea
in
a
murder
case,
he
maybe
sentence
either
to
life
imprisonment
or
to
a
term
of
not
more
than
30
years.
this
is
true
even
though
the
defendant
in
setting
fort
a
factual
basis
for
his
plea
may
admit
that
he
is
committed
a
felony
murder.
the
judge
is
not
to
make
any
determination
as
to
the
degree
of
the
crime
rather
the
judge
has
complete
discretion
to
impose
any
sentence
which
to
him
appears
appropriate,
however,
if
that
same
defendant
goes
to
trial
on
the
same
facts
and
is
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
then
he
must
receive
the
mandatory
life
sentence
and
this
case
of
course.
mr.
corbitt
did
go
to
trial
in
a
felony
murder
case
and
he
was
convicted.
therefore,
he
had
to
receive
the
mandatory
life
sentence.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
true.
if
you
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
all
trials
must
be
jury
trials.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
under
the
mandatory
life
sentence,
he's
eligible
for
a
parole
as
i
understand
it
in
14
years,
8
months,
and
10
days.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
i
honestly
couldn't
say
your
honor.
i
just
know
that
they
are
eligible
for
parole
at
that
time.
in
any
event,
it
is
clear
that
in
this
case,
mr.
corbitt
as
i
said
went
to
trial
and
was
convicted
of
felony
murder
at
this
sentencing,
his
attorney
ask
the
court
to
consider
imposing
a
term
of
years
in
the
state
prison
as
he
could
have
done
had
mr.
corbitt
enter
the
non
vult
plea.
however,
the
judge
indicated
that
he
was
powerless
to
do
so.
therefore,
it
is
clear
that
simply
because
mr.
corbitt
was
convicted
at
a
jury
trial.
he
was
denied
the
right
to
be
sentence
to
a
term
of
years
in
the
state
prison.
we
submit
that
this
lost
of
discretion
in
the
sentencing
judge
or
lack
of
sentencing
alternatives
is
a
severe
penalty
for
defendant
to
pay,
simply
because
he
is
exercise
his
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
clear
distinction
to
be
made
between
this
case
and
in
bordenkircher.
bordenkircher
was
dealing
with
the
practice
of
plea
bargaining
and
this
court
held
that
a
defendant
who
engages
in
plea
bargaining
and
turns
down
a
plea
bargain
is
not
penalize
for
asserting
his
rights.
in
new
jersey,
a
defendant
who
refuses
to
enter
a
non
vult
plea
in
a
murder
case
but
instead
goes
to
trial
is
penalize
for
asserting
his
rights.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
the
new
jersey
legislature
as
indicated
that
people
who
are
willing
to
waive
their
constitutional
rights
maybe
sentence
to
almost
any
term
from
probation
up
to
life
imprisonment.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
in
bordenkircher,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
simply
the
prosecutor
could've
proceeded
on
habitual
offender
indictment
at
the
very
beginning
so
the
defendant
was
eligible
for
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
on
the
day
that
he
was
first
indited
as
it
were
he
start
paid
no
penalty
because
he
ultimately
was
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
mr.
corbitt
of
course,
could've
receive
a
much
lesser
sentence
had
he
plead
non
vult
and
because
he
was
denied
these
sentencing
alternatives
when
he
was
convicted
to
trial.
he
did
pay
a
penalty
for
exercising
his
rights.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
very
true.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
very
true
but
i
don't
think
that
factor
distinguishes
this
case
from
united
states
versus
jackson
on
which
i
rely.
jackson
of
course
was
the
appeal
of
a
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
granted.
in
that
case,
mr.
jackson
could've
been
acquitted
and
for
that
matter
he
could've
been
found
guilty
of
kidnapping
but
the
jury
could've
recommended
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
and
this
case
is
different
only
in
that
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
but
both
trials
in
murder
cases
must
be
jury
trials.
but
the
fact
is
that
in
jackson,
this
court
held
that
the
risk
of
the
death
penalty
was
in
unnecessary
burden
upon
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
jury
trial.
and
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
it
is
the
risk
of
this
mandatory
life
sentence
which
is
also
an
unnecessary
burden
upon
the
same
right.
now
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
true.
i
was
just
getting
to
that.
the
state
of
course
claims
that
jackson
is
limited
solely
to
death
penalty
cases
and
i
think
that
this
contention
is
at
odds
with
a
long
line
of
cases
which
have
come
from
this
court
holding
that
no
significant
burden
maybe
place
upon
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right.
this
court's
analysis
has
never
been
limited
solely
to
death
penalty
cases
or
even
to
case
involving
long
terms
of
imprisonment
rather
this
been
held
that
any
sanction
which
makes
assertion
of
a
right
costly
is
forbidden.
and
in
for
example,
garrity
versus
new
jersey,
it
was
held
that
a
state
trooper
could
not
be
penalize
through
lost
of
his
employment
because
he
had
asserted
is
fifth
amendment
rights.
in
harmon
versus
francis,
it
was
held
that
the
filing
of
a
certificate
of
registration
and
rule
of
a
poll
tax.
it
was
an
impermissible
burden
upon
the
right
to
vote
in
state
elections.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
have
to
face
the
fact
that
people
who
plead
guilty
whether
or
not
there
are
plea
bargains
commonly
received
lesser
sentences
on
crimes.
however,
those
people
do
so
freely
and
knowledgably,
they
pay
--
if
they
refuse
to
enter
that
plea
of
guilty,
they
will
pay
no
penalty
for
doing
so
because
when
they
are
sentenced,
they
are
still
eligible
for
any
sentence
within
the
statutory
range.
of
course,
in
new
jersey
a
defendant
who
refuses
to
enter
this
non
vult
plea
must
receive
the
maximum,
so
his
constitutional
right
is
being
directly
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
opinion
in
that
case
knows
that
rather
clearly
that
the
prosecutor
could've
begun
from
the
very
first
day
on
habitual
offender
indictment.
the
man
fiddle
the
criteria
for
that
indictment,
it
was
just
done
in
the
sort
of
the
reverse
of
the
normal
plea
bargaining
process
which
is
that
the
prosecutor
indicts
on
a
crime
and
then
deals
down.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
and
that's
exactly
what
he
did
and
for
doing
that,
he
paid
this
penalty.
he
was
not
eligible
for
this
lesser
term
in
the
state
prison
even
though
the
judge
has
sentenced
him
might
have
felt
that
this
sort
of
sentence
was
completely
warranted.
in
any
event
as
i've
said,
i've
mentioned
the
lost
of
employment
in
garrity
versus
new
jersey
in
the
filing
of
a
search
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that'
true.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
always
a
possibility.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
it
certainly
is
an
incentive
to
disregard
his
jury
right.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
i
think
a
distinction
has
to
be
made
between
offering
the
defendant
incentives
to
give
up
his
constitutional
rights
and
penalizing
him
if
he
doesn't
give
up
those
rights.
a
defendant
who
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
of
course,
he
must
receive
the
life
sentence
if
he
is
convicted
upon
the
jury
trial.
now,
i've
discussed
these
sanctions,
the
lost
of
employment
and
the
filing
of
certificate
little
poll
tax
and
these
are
relatively
minor
sanctions
that
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
are
the
type
of
sanctions
which
deter
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right.
i
think
that
this
new
jersey
murder
statute
has
the
same
effect.
a
defendant
in
a
first
degree
murder
case
is
not
going
to
want
to
exercise
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
face
the
possibility
of
a
mandatory
life
sentence
when
he
can
plead
non
vult,
admit
the
crime,
and
still
be
eligible
for
a
few
years
in
the
state
prison
or
for
that
matter
even
a
term
of
probation.
now,
the
state
of
course
claims
that
there
is
a
need
for
this
kind
of
sentencing
provision
and
that
it
promotes
plea
bargaining.
now,
our
office
is
not
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
of
course
that
could
be
done
through
any
number
of
other
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
our
office
is
not
in
anyway
opposed
to
plea
bargaining
nor
do
we
wish
to
restrict
the
practice
in
any
manner.
it
is
simply
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
certainly
not.
it
is
simply
our
position
that
plea
bargaining
is
no
way
involved
in
this
case.
this
statute
is
not
analogist
to
plea
bargaining
and
it's
certainly
not
necessary
to
plea
bargaining.
in
fact,
this
appears
to
be
a
very
unique
statute.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
other
criminal
statute
in
the
united
states
which
contains
separate
ranges
of
penalties
for
a
defendant
who
is
convicted
upon
a
jury
trial
and
a
defendant
who
is
convicted
upon
a
guilty
plea.
in
fact,
this
is
the
only
new
jersey
statute
which
has
separate
penalty
ranges.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
certainly,
to
lesser
included
the
things
and
that's
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
here
we
have
as
i
said
before.
we
have
two
penalties
for
the
same
offense,
a
person
who
plea
bargain
say
starts
out
with
an
armed
robbery
case
and
pleads
to
robbery
by
fear
is
certainly
can't
be
compared
to
the
person
who
goes
to
trial
and
is
convicted
of
armed
robbery.
i'm
just
comparing
mr.
corbitt's
situation
having
been
convicted
of
felony
murder
after
jury
trial
with
the
position
of
people
who
plead
non
vult
to
the
crime,
admit
the
crime,
and
are
still
eligible
for
much
lesser
sentence.
now,
as
i've
said
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
true.
and
mr.
corbitt
insisted
upon
his
rights
and
for
that
he
received
a
mandatory
penalty.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
he
decides
to
plead
non
vult
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
he
still
eligible
for
either
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
or
a
sentence
of
up
to
30
years
in
the
state
prison.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
i
suppose,
it
would
help
my
argument
because
i
can't
see
any
distinction
between
a
person
who
admits
his
skill
halfway
through
a
trial
and
a
person
who
in
fact
insist
upon
his
rights
all
the
way
and
is
convicted
after
the
trial.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
that
doesn't
have
to
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
to
be
the
practice
in
new
jersey.
in
any
event,
well
as
i've
said,
this
is
the
only
new
jersey
statute
which
has
separate
penalty
ranges.
yet,
we
know
that
plea
bargaining
works
in
new
jersey
in
all
other
statutes.
it
works
in
robbery
cases,
in
kidnapping
cases.
it
works
for
any
other
crime
that
one
could
mention.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
sort
of
unique
sentencing
scheme
therefore
is
necessary
in
anyway
to
conduct
plea
bargaining
rather
it
is
unnecessary
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
versus
jackson,
“it
is
unnecessary
and
therefore
excessive.”
as
i've
indicated
previously,
the
statute
is
not
analogous
to
the
process
of
plea
bargaining.
first
of
all,
as
i've
said
before,
it's
not
a
voluntary
process
and
secondly
it
does
not
contain
the
mutuality
of
advantage
which
is
commonly
found
in
plea
bargaining.
the
defendant's
aim
in
a
plea
bargaining
is
always
to
reduce
his
maximum
possible
exposure
on
a
crime
and
there's
of
course
any
number
of
ways
that
this
can
be
done.
but
a
defendant
who
pleads
non
vult
in
new
jersey
does
not
limit
his
maximum
possible
exposure
for
he's
still
eligible
for
the
life
sentence.
the
only
thing
that
defendant
achieves
by
pleading
non
vult
is
that
he
insulates
himself
from
the
possibility
of
the
mandatory
life
sentence
which
comes
upon
a
jury
conviction.
therefore,
we
would
submit
that
this
murder
statute
is
nothing
more
than
a
unilateral
penalty
imposed
upon
those
persons
who
have
exercised
their
rights.
i
recognize
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
is
often
times
called
upon
to
make
difficult
choices
but
the
threshold
question
has
always
been
thus
compelling
an
election
between
two
alternatives
impair
to
any
appreciable
extent
the
underlying
right
involved.
and
i
think
i've
demonstrated
that
this
new
jersey
murder
statute
does
in
fact
deter
defendants
from
exercising
their
constitutional
rights.
in
a
number
of
cases,
this
court
has
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
the
concept
of
vindictiveness.
it
is
been
held
that
a
defendant
may
not
be
vindictively
penalize
for
exercising
a
right
and
we
submit
that
this
is
exactly
what
the
new
jersey
murder
statute
does.
it
requires
that
the
defendant
who
insists
upon
his
rights
must
receive
the
maximum
sentence.
this
is
no
different
than
a
judge
that
would
announce
that
it's
his
policy
to
impose
the
maximum
sentence
on
any
defendant,
who
dares
come
before
him
in
a
jury
trial
and
he
is
convicted.
thus,
as
i've
indicated
in
the
final
analysis,
this
statute
unnecessarily
deters
the
right
to
jury
trial
while
penalizing
those
defendants
who
insist
upon
the
rights.
if
i
may
move
on
to
my
equal
protection
argument,
as
i've
indicated
before,
there
are
two
scales
of
punishment
for
first
degree
murder
in
new
jersey.
this
classification
is
not
based
in
anyway
on
the
personal
or
penal
status
of
the
offender
but
rather
solely
upon
whether
he
has
exercised
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
defendant
is
a
young
man
or
an
old
man
or
whether
he
has
no
prior
conviction
so
as
a
habitual
offender.
rather
the
first
decision
that
the
sentencing
judge
must
make
in
this
sort
of
case
is
whether
the
defendant
has
exercise
his
right
to
a
trial.
if
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
upon
a
non
vult
plea,
then
the
judge
of
course
has
complete
discretion
to
impose
almost
any
sentence
between
probation
and
life
imprisonment.
if
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
upon
a
jury
verdict,
then
the
judge
has
no
discretion.
he
must
impose
the
maximum
sentence
even
if
he
feels
a
lesser
sentence
is
wanted.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
correctly.
i
would
think
that
there
would
still
be
a
defect
in
that
and
that
even
if
a
defendant
waive
the
jury
that
the
--
he
would
still
be
eligible
for
a
wide
range
of
sentences
upon
a
non
vult
plea
while
he
would
still
have
to
receive
the
maximum
penalty
upon
a
conviction
whether
it'd
be
a
judge
conviction
or
a
jury
conviction.
i
have
no
objection
to
the
concept
of
extending
leniency
towards
those
persons
who
admit
their
guilt.
but
this
provides
no
justification
whatsoever
for
imposing
the
maximum
sentence
on
a
defendant
simply
because
he
has
exercised
his
rights
to
a
jury
trial.
it
maybe
that
in
certain
cases,
a
judge
as
a
matter
of
his
own
discretion
will
feel
that
a
defendant
who
has
admitted
his
guilt
is
more
emendable
to
rehabilitation,
but
it
does
not
logically
follow
that
the
defendant
who
has
insisted
upon
his
constitutional
rights
must
be
so
incorrigible
that
only
the
maximum
sentence
would
be
appropriate.
in
this
case,
we
are
simply
asking
that
the
defendant
having
insisted
upon
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
be
eligible
for
the
same
range
of
penalties
that
he
would've
been
admitted
his
guilt
through
a
non
vult
plea.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
if
not
in
this
particular
case.
i've
use
the
felony
murder
example
in
my
brief
because
this
was
a
felony
murder
case.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
right,
it
was
--
if
the
jury
was
not
charge
here
with
either
second
degree
murder
or
manslaughter.
if
mr.
corbitt
was
convicted,
it
would've
had
been
for
a
felony
murder.
if
would've
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
correct.
if
we
would've
plead
non
vult,
he
also
would've
had
to
admit
if
a
felony
murder
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
he
would've
said
your
honor,
i
started
the
fire
and
i
mean
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
although
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
although,
murder
encompasses
both
first
degree
murder
and
second
degree
murder
and
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
no,
you're
pleading
guilty
to
non
vult
to
murder
and
you're
admitting
a
felony
murder
or
first
degree
murder.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
no,
it
would've
been
to
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
a
non-specified
degree
of
murder
but
as
i've
indicated
before,
he
obviously
and
setting
for
the
factual
basis
for
his
plea,
he
would've
had
to
admit
having
committed
a
felony
murder.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
anything
unconstitutional
about
that.
i
don't
think
it'd
be
a
wise
legislative
policy
but
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
like
i
said,
as
long
as
the
same
range
of
penalties
is
available,
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
it.
i
certainly
think
that
that
would
be
an
unwise
legislative
policy
but
of
course
that's
for
the
states
to
decide.
as
i've
said
before,
simply
because
mr.
corbitt
here
has
exercised
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
he
was
not
eligible
for
a
number
of
valuable
sentencing
alternatives
which
of
course
is
a
sentence
up
to
30
years
in
the
state
prison.
therefore,
the
defendant
would
submit
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
equal
protection
laws
in
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
many
i'd
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
should
not
however
that
a
maximum
-
a
life
sentence
upon
a
jury
conviction
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
a
life
sentence
upon
a
non
vult
plea
and
that
the
life
sentence
upon
a
jury
conviction
of
course
is
mandatory
and
must
be
to
the
state
prison.
a
life
sentence
upon
a
non
vult
plea
is
purely
discretionary.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
it
maybe
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
true,
but
not
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that
certainly
a
factual
distinction,
your
honor.
i
would
submit
however,
that
the
real
question
that
must
be
decided
in
the
case
like
this
is,
“does
the
statutory
scheme
serve
to
deter
exercise
of
the
constitutional
right?”
and
i
think
that
this
clearly
deters
defendants
from
exercising
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
therefore
i
would
submit
it's
unconstitutional
just
as
the
federal
kidnapping
act.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
all
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
when
he
said
support
the
factual
basis
for
a
plea
where
he
would
have
to
admit
it.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well,
that's
interesting.
they
found
him
guilty
of
murder.
now,
under
new
jersey
law,
they
are
required
to
specify
either
first
degree
murder
or
second
degree
murder.
they
did
not
do
that.
they
just
said
murder
but
of
course
this
was
a
felony
murder
case.
there
was
no
instruction
given
on
second
degree
murder
and
the
assumption
of
course
always
was
made
that
he
had
to
receive
the
mandatory
life
sentence.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
well
--
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
the
situation
there
was
that
when,
i
first
got
this
case
after
had
been
accepted
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
i
attempted
to
raise
that
same
argument
but
they
had
granted
certification
limited
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
and
they
did
not
choose
to
hear
me
on
that
argument.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
k.
smith,
jr.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
make
just
one
quick
point
that
being
that
a
defendant
in
new
jersey
of
course
cannot
plead
to
the
offense
of
first
degree
murder.
pleads
are
not
accepted
to
either
first
degree
or
second
degree
murder.
now,
the
state
before
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
made
the
same
argument
that
basically
there
was
a
difference
between
any
conviction
for
first
degree
murder
and
the
conviction
for
murder.
and
in
new
jersey
supreme
court
held
then
i'm
reading
from
page
33
of
the
appendix
that
we
do
not
accept
their
position
as
a
fully
satisfied
rebases
for
meeting
the
defendant's
argument
which
it
seems
to
us
can
and
should
be
dealt
with
more
directly.
i
think
therefore
that
the
opinion
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
does
not
revolve
on
this
matter
of
statutory
construction
but
it
was
decided
upon
the
constitutional
principles
upon
the
assumption
that
the
person
who
pleads
non
vult
for
murder
and
admits
a
felony
murder
is
in
fact
in
the
same
position
as
the
person
who
is
convicted
of
a
felony
murder.
thank
you
very
much.
