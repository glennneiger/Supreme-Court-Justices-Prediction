justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
make
any
difference
for
our
purposes
or
whatever
difference
there
maybe
between
non
vult
and
nolo
contendere
from
new
jersey?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
you
cited
in
your
brief
our
decision
last
year
bordenkircher
against
hayes
and
this
case
strikes
me
as
not
too
much
different
from
the
new
jersey
legislature
is
simply
enacting
in
the
law
but
the
prosecutor
actually
did
in
bordenkircher.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
has
in
the
new
jersey
legislature
just
specifies
the
terms
of
the
plea
bargaining
in
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
what
the
prosecutor
did
in
bordenkircher,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
--
but
there
was
certainly
a
burden
in
bordenkircher
too,
was
there
not,
as
a
result
of
the
prosecutor's
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
in
bordenkircher,
the
man
was
originally
charge
with
something
that
wasn't
his
greatest
and
it
was
finally
charge
with
after
he
refused
the
plea
bargain.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
in
new
jersey
that
your
client
could
from
the
very
first
day
have
elected
his
jury
trial
and
refuse
to
plead
non
vult
and
he
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
prosecutors
make
that
kind
of
offer
everyday
of
the
week?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
if
a
prosecutor
makes
it
or
if
a
legislature
makes
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
give
up
the
right
to
be
found
not
guilty
by
a
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
the
new
jersey
system
be
constitutionally
acceptable
in
your
view,
if
the
statute
didn't
require
that
all
not
guilty
pleas
be
trialed
to
a
jury
but
simply
require
that
if
there
was
to
be
a
waiver
of
a
jury,
it
had
to
be
by
both
sides?
you
know,
it's
both
the
defendant
and
the
prosecution
would
have
to
waive
the
jury.
