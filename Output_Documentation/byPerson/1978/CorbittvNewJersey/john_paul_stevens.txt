justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
to
me
what
that
interest
is?
is
it
anything
other
than
the
interest
in
same
interest
you
have
in
the
plea
bargaining
of
course
and
persuading
the
defendant
not
to
stand
on
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
are
always
present
when
you
persuade
the
defendant
not
to
stand
trial
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then
that
is
still
true
that
the
solo
thing
that
this
accomplish,
tends
to
accomplish
is
to
persuade
to
not
stand
trial
and
their
buy
products
are
there
if
it
works
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
statute
allows
him
to
avoid
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
can't
avoid
that
if
he
elects
to
exercise
a
constitutional
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me
again,
mr.
decicco,
you
say
the
court
has
upheld
statutory
schemes
such
as
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
it
ever
upheld
a
statutory
scheme
in
which
the
range
of
penalties
for
one
who
stands
trial
is
more
severe
than
the
range
of
penalties
for
the
one
who
pleads
not
guilty,
who
pleads
guilty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
doesn't
upheld
statutory
scheme?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
different
from
just
changing
the
minimum
and
rather
that
if
one
case,
you
can
get
either
30
days
of
life
imprisonment,
the
other
case,
you
must
get
life
imprisonment,
you
have
the
same
maximum.
but
are
you
suggesting
there's
no
material
difference
between
those
choices
because
the
maximum
is
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true
that
plea
bargaining
in
general
but
i
don't
see
how
that
supports
your
notion
that
as
long
as
the
maximums
or
this
maxima
are
the
same
and
both
alternatives.
there
is
no
significant
disparity.
i
take
it,
that's
your
distinction
of
jackson.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
decicco,
if
you
rely
in
the
death
penalty
as
the
distinguishing
feature,
are
you
suggesting
that
it
would
be
impermissible
for
a
prosecutor
who
would
indicted
the
defendant
for
obtaining
an
indictment
for
a
capital
offense
to
offer
as
an
inducement
to
a
plea
of
guilty
that
he
would
waive,
he
would
withdraw
the
capital
charge
and
substitute
a
lesser
charge.
there
was
can
and
--
is
it
permissible
plea
bargaining
to
offer
--
to
dismiss
a
capital
charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
permissible,
then
how
does
that
distinguish
the
jackson
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
decicco
on
your
maximum
distinction,
supposing
a
statute
provided
that
for
reckless
driving
or
speeding,
the
penalty
could
be
anywhere
from
a
$10.00
fine
to
a
maximum
of
30
days
in
jail.
but
if
the
man
likes
to
stand
on
trial,
the
maximum
of
30
days
in
jail
must
be
imposed.
would
you
think
that
was
a
balance
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
what
respect,
unless
severe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
sets
a
fine
should
be
up
to
$5,000.00
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
from
$10.00
to
$5,000.00
with
the
judge's
discretion
but
if
he
stands
trial
it's
$5,000.00.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
said
that's
perfectly
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
it
would
be
different
though
if
the
maximum
was
30
days
in
jail
instead
of
$5,000.00?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no,
out
of
the
maximum
in
both
cases.
it's
from
$10.00
fine
to
a
maximum
of
30
days
in
jail
and
the
$10.00
fine
to
a
$5,000.00.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
and
in
the
other
case,
the
30-day
jail
is
automatically
impose
if
he
likes
to
stand
on
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you'd
say,
how
do
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
same
case
as
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
--
well,
how
do
you
say
that
statute
would
be
all
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
maxima
is
the
same
--
maxima
are
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
as
soon
as
you
admit
that,
how
do
you
get
out
of
the
box
in
this
case
then,
what
is
the
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
maximum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
would've
been
the
minimum
if
he'd
pleaded
that
he
taken
a
plea?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
quite
a
difference
range.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
greater
or
a
lesser
than
the
difference
i
gave
to
you
of
$100.00
to
30
days
in
jail
and
--
