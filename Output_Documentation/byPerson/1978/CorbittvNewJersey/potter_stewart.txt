justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
under
your
system
in
new
jersey
if
a
defendant
pleads
not
guilty,
he
may
not
waive
a
jury,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
he
cannot
have
a
bench
trial
on
a
guilty
plea.
justice
potter
stewart
you
cannot
have
a
bench
trial
on
a
not
guilty
plea.
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
on
the
other
hand
that
he
pleaded
not
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
and
he
could've
been
found
not
guilty.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
having
pleaded
non
vult,
he
couldn't
possible
have
been
found
not
guilty,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
jackson
case,
the
defendant
could've
pleaded
not
guilty
and
a
way
of
the
jury
trial
and
the
judge
other
than
that
statute,
the
federal
statute
could
not
possibly
have
imposed
to
their
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
only
the
jury
could
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
here
he
can't
waive
with
jury
trial.
he
can't
have
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
jackson
and
all
the
death
sentence
which
is
emphasize
by
your
state's
supreme
court.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
he
pleads
not
--
if
he
pleads
not
guilty
to
a
charge
and
indictment
of
first
degree
murder,
he
can
be
found
not
guilty.
he
can
be
found
guilty
of
some
lesser
included
offense
of
homicide,
could
he?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
an
arson,
it
was
not
a
theft.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
first
degree
murder
in
new
jersey,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
he
wouldn't
have
been
admitting
a
felony
murder.
he
wouldn't
have
been
admitting
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
isn't
it
--
am
i
not
correct
as
a
matter
of
technical
new
jersey
law,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
law
that
when
you
plead
non
vult,
it's
not
to
a
degree
of
homicide?
it's
just
to
murder,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
general
as
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
is
not
guilty
of,
you're
not
pleading
non
vult
to
felony
murder
or
the
first
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
felony
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
had
he
pleaded
non
vult
and
it
would
not
have
been
to
a
felony
murder,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
just
one
--
if
you're
relying
on
jackson,
one
very
clear
differences
that
in
jackson,
if
a
defendant
pleaded
either
guilty
of
kidnapping
with
harm
to
the
victim
in
her
state
or
if
he
pleaded
not
guilty
with
the
same
offense
and
waive
the
jury
trial.
he
absolutely
could
not
have
been
sentence
to
death.
justice
potter
stewart
here,
if
he
pleads
non
vult,
he
can
be
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
the
same
maximum
sentence
that
a
jury
could
impose.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
but
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
sentencing
judge
may
imposed
it
and
may
send
him
to
the
state
prison.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
makes
us
different
from
the
jackson
case
where
there
was
absolutely
no
power
in
the
absence
of
a
jury
recommendation
under
the
statute
to
impose
the
sentence
that
a
jury
could've
recommended.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
the
jury
found
your
client
guilty
of
what,
murder
or
felony
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
or
could
you
make
assumptions
in
criminal
in
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
when
the
jury
hasn't
found
him
guilty
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
by
hypothesis
in
this
case,
he
was
found
guilty
of
felony
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
unless
it's
stronger
than
that,
the
death
penalty
could
not
be
imposed
on
a
such
defendant.
could
not
legally
have
been
imposed
a
point.
not
everybody
is
eligible
for
something
less.
justice
potter
stewart
did
this
particular
defendant
face
any
alternatives
other
than
those
of
acquittal
or
conviction
of
felony
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
instructions
--
justice
potter
stewart
included.
justice
potter
stewart
and
convicted
of
an
offense
for
which
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
punishment
was
mandatory
life
imprisonment.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
with
during
the
jackson
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
much
was
during
the
jackson
case.
justice
potter
stewart
he
could've
been
acquitted
because
we
were
in
that
case
was
--
we
are
not
dealing
there
was
a
convicted
person,
we're
we?
there
hadn't
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
hadn't
the
district
judge
--
judge
timbers,
found
the
whole
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
jackson
case.
that
might
right
in
my
recollection.
justice
potter
stewart
or
were
we
dealing
with
somebody
who'd
been
convicted
by
a
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
in
jackson.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
there
had
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
district
judge
had
found
the
whole
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
the
district
court
had
held
the
entire
statute
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
in
jackson.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
not
the
one
before
the
judge
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
result
of
non
vult
--
