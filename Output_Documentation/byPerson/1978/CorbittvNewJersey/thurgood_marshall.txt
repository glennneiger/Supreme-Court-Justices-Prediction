mr.
smith,
what
happens
in
new
jersey
if
two-thirds
of
the
way
through
the
trial
before
a
jury,
he
decides
to
plead
guilty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
help
for
each
align?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
party
alignment
that
once
it
goes
into
it
he
is
irrevocably
stocked
with
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
don't
need
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
aren't
they
both
convictions,
the
judges
convictions
and
the
charged
the
both
convictions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
you
said
that
they
were
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
one
is
a
conviction
and
one
is
not,
you're
not
saying
that
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
when
the
other
what
is
won
before
the
judge
the
non
vult?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don't
you
have
to
explain
to
the
judge
what
you
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
don't
--
doesn't
the
judge
determine
whether
that's
manslaughter,
first
degree
or
its
like
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
does
the
judge
determine
how
much
time
you'll
get?
justice
thurgood
marshall
be
careful
what
you're
saying
now.
the
judge
gets
whatever
time
he
wants.
now,
do
you
have
to
determine
whether
in
his
own
mind
doesn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
he
give
the
same
time
for
first
degree
murder
as
manslaughter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
would
you
do
that
the
same
if
the
man
just
came
in
and
says
i
want
to
trial
before
a
judge
without
a
jury.
will
the
judge
do
the
same
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
any
of
the
other
50
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
other
50
states
where
he
could.
wouldn't
the
judge
determine
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
seen
part
of
it
did
worse
me
as
the
distinction
that
you
see
that
i
don't
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
um-huh.
