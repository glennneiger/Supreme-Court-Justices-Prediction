mr.
peter
a.
schey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
offers
this
court
first
opportunity
to
provide
plenary
review
to
this
nation's
income
maintenance
program.
likewise
provides
a
first
opportunity
to
be
provides
plenary
review
to
international
right
to
travel
case
since
zemel
versus
rusk
in
1965.
the
income
maintenance
program
also
known
as
the
ssi
program
provides
the
subsistence
for
four
and
half
million
american
citizens.
these
persons
are
elderly
person
who
are
either
disabled
at
birth
or
disabled
later
in
life
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i
--
i
think
that
same
arguments
would
apply,
should
the
same
restrictions
apply
to
title
ii.
i've
--
i
raise
this
because
mrs.
aznavorian
who
worked
as
seamstress
for
most
of
her
life
here
in
the
united
states
simply
not
fortunate
enough
to
have
that
employment
covered
by
title
ii.
at
this
point,
she
is
an
elderly
person
living
with
illness
who
chose
to
go
to
mexico
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
we
believe
that
the
case
could
be
analyzed
under
either
an
equal
protection
or
due
process
approach.
we
believe
that
the
result
would
be
that
the
same
under
either
approach.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
but
we
believe
that
the
primary
analysis
and
the
primary
analysis
presented
in
our
brief
is
a
due
process
analysis.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i
was
just
mentioning
her
status,
vis-à-vis
the
employment
to
highlight
what
we
feel
is
the
discriminatory
impact
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes,
your
honor.
i
may
point
out,
mrs.
aznavorian
travelled
to
mexico
intending
to
return
to
the
united
states
within
one
month.
the
record
reflects
that
she
was
aware
of
the
limitation
on
her
right
to
travel.
the
record
also
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
your
honor,
we
believe
contrary
to
the
secretary
that
the
cases
of
kent,
aptheker,
and
zemel
clearly
established.
and
in
fact,
that
750
years
anglo-american
jurisprudence
clearly
established
a
right
to
leave
the
boundaries
of
this
country
and
to
reenter
to
the
boundaries
of
this
country.
while
the
case
of
aptheker
which
also
decided
constitutionality
of
a
statute
did
not
utilize
language
with
to
a
strict
two-tier
analysis
the
language
utilized
is
interesting,
if
i
may
just
quote
one
or
two
sentences.
even
though
the
government
purpose
be
legitimate
and
substantial,
that
purpose
cannot
be
pursued
by
means
that
broadly
stifle
fundamental
personal
liberties
when
the
end
can
be
more
narrowly
achieved.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
case
of
shapiro
versus
thompson
relies
in
its
adoption
of
a
heightened
scrutiny
standard.
relies
on
the
precisely
the
same
cases
which
the
case
of
aptheker
relied
on.
in
fact,
it
relies
on
precisely
the
same
pages
of
the
same
cases
that
the
aptheker
case
relied
on.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
your
honor
i
do
agree.
i
think
that
all
three
cases
did
have
first
amendment
overtones.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
but
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--
however,
the
court
in
zemel
very
clearly
stated
at
page
16,
“we
cannot
accept
the
contention
of
appellant
that
it
is
a
first
amendment
right
which
is
here
involved
to
the
extend
that
the
secretary's
refusal
to
validate
passports
as
in
inhibition”.
it
is
an
inhibition
of
action
and
there
are
few
restrictions
on
action
which
could
not
be
cloth
by
ingenious
argument
in
the
garb
of
decreased
data
flow.
now
clearly
though
and
i
should
also
point
out
your
honors
that
in
the
--
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
case
of
aptheker,
justice
black
in
contrast
to
the
majority
opinion
relied
on
the
first
amendment
and
felt
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
as
the
majority
had
done.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no,
it
did
not
your
honor.
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
secretary
makes
here.
the
secretary's
argument
throughout
is
that
no
more
than
a
rational
basis
test
should
apply
here.
and
he
draws
that
conclusion
by
saying
that
the
impact
here
is
only
indirect.
it
is
not
direct.
however,
this
court
recognize,
it
certainly
recognized
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
and
in
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--
and
it
also
recognized
in
aptheker,
and
in
kent,
and
in
zemel.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
an
absolute
prohibition.
it
did
not
join
it.
all
that
it
involved
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--
was
the
fact
that
he
couldn't
get
a
passport.in
fact,
in
zemel
which
was
the
only
case
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
in
which
it
found
that
the
government
interest
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
decided
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no,
you
don't.
that
was
decided
and
i
believe
1976
in
the
case
of
us
versus
laub
in
this
very
court.
that
in
fact
in
that
case
in
us
versus
laub
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
the
government
and
the
parties
agreed
that
hundreds
of
persons
had
traveled
not
only
in
thousands
have
traveled
without
passports
but
that
hundreds
had
traveled
through
the
years
in
violation
of
the
area
restrictions
that
were
involved
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
your
honor,
the
issue
in
laub
was
not
whether
not
the
people
had
been
in
courts
or
not.
the
very
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
the
issue
--
your
honor,
in
aptheker,
the
person
was
not
precluded
from
traveling.
there
was
no
direct
prohibition
on
his
right
to
leave
to
the
country.
the
sole
question
was
whether
or
not
he
could
leave
the
country
with
a
passport.
it
was
indirect
prohibition
and
the
same
was
true
in
the
case
zemel
versus
rusk
which
of
course
in
that
case,
the
government
interest
was
extremely
large.
the
cuban
missile
crisis
was
occurring
at
the
time
and
nevertheless,
mr.
zemel
could
still
travel
to
cuba
which
is
where
he
wanted
to
go.
i'm
not
saying
that
that
is
right
or
wrong
but
that
is
the
reality
that
what
the
case
decided
and
in
fact
with
every
case
as
this
court
very
clearly
said
in
a
case
of
memorial
hospital
versus
maricopa
county.
that
in
order
to
find
an
infringement
and
it
is
said
in
the
abortion
cases
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
in
which
case,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
a.
schey
your
honor,
that
was
not
an
international
case.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
however,
i
believe
that
the
importance
of
that
case
as
the
importance
in
aptheker,
kent,
and
zemel
is
that
this
court
does
not
require
a
total
flat
prohibition
on
the
exercise
of
a
right
before
it
finds
an
infringement
of
that
right.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no.
we
are
not
claiming
that
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
there
are
different
reasons
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
international
ability
to
travel
back
and
forth
across
the
frontiers
has
the
equivalent
constitutional
weight
that
interstate
right
to
travel
has.
and
i
think
that
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
indicate
that
i
should
also
point
out
though
that
this
court
and
lower
courts
for
the
past
20
years
and
in
a
number
of
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief
about
half
a
page
of
cases
has
cited
the
interstate
and
the
international
cases
interchangeably.
in
recognizing
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
what
the
--
what
in
the
case
of
aptheker,
this
court
defined
the
travel
as
a
fundamental
liberty
and
they
then
went
on
unlike
what
the
secretary
suggests
that
which
is
that
they
merely
applied
a
rational
basis
test.
it's
absolutely
false.
the
government
argued
a
rational
basis
test
in
kent,
in
aptheker,
in
zemel,
and
in
laub
and
in
all
four
of
those
cases
this
court
rejected
the
terminology
of
a
rational
basis
test.
this
in
fact
marks
the
fifth
occasion
in
which
the
government
has
requested
that
this
court
adopt
no
more
than
a
rational
basis
test
when
analyzing
the
fundamental
liberty
of
traveling
across
our
borders.
in
every
one
of
the
prior
cases
that
request
was
denied.
in
fact
in
aptheker,
the
lower
court
specifically
applied
a
rational
basis
test.
in
aptheker
and
zemel
the
dissent
in
this
court
specifically
applied
a
rational
basis
test.
we
believe
that
--
well,
i'm
not
arguing
that
the
same
heightened
scrutiny
that
the
strict
scrutiny
which
applied
in
shapiro
should
apply
in
this
case.
we
have
argued
that
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
your
honor,
we
are
not
arguing.
i
--
my
statement
was
that
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
strictest
of
scrutiny
standards
which
was
developed
--
which
were
developed
in
shapiro
do
apply
here.
instead
we're
arguing
that
this
court
should
recognize
as
it
has
done
in
matters
of
marriage,
as
it
has
done
in
matters
of
abortion,
as
it
has
done
in
matters
of
illegitimacy
that
here
involved
is
a
basic
liberty.
i
mean
all
of
those
cases
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
in
mathews
versus
lucas;
mr.
justice
stevens
in
califano
versus
jobst,
the
two
cases
just
cited
by
the
secretary.
in
looking
at
the
relationship
between
the
purpose
of
a
governmental
restriction
and
the
means
implemented
to
effectuate
that
purpose.
those
cases
which
both
involved
social
security
benefits
stated.
we
must
look
at
the
reasonably
empirical
judgments
of
the
presumptions
involved.
the
jobst
case
cited
by
the
secretary
said,
we
must
look
to
see
where
the
"tradition
and
common
experience"
support
the
presumptions.
we
would
argue
your
honors
that
neither
reasonably
empirical
judgments
nor
tradition
and
common
experience
nor
any
of
the
tests
outlined
in
aptheker
would
support
the
statute.
the
secretary
argues
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
in
his
primary
argument
is
that
it
implements
the
residency
requirements.
but
when
we
carefully
examine
the
statute,
it
is
apparently
clear
that
it
comes
nowhere
close
to
do
in
anything
even
superficially
related
with
implementing
a
residency
requirement.
first
of
all,
the
statute
has
no
legislative
history
whatsoever
and
no
legislative
study
whatsoever.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
your
honor.
if
that's
what
the
statute
instead
to
accomplish
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no.
i
think
i
would
then
be
making
different
arguments
about
the
validity
of
that
kind
of
restriction.
we
would
probably
then
be
discussing
balance
of
payments
deficits
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
your
honor,
i
think
under
those
circumstances.
we
would
have
to
examine
as
i
think
we
have
to
do
under
these
circumstances
the
legitimacy
of
the
purpose.
we
may
assume
that
under
those
circumstances
the
purpose
would
be
legitimate.
requiring
expenditure
of
funds
within
the
united
states
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes,
i
think
we
would
because
we
would
still
have
to
analyze
whether
or
not
the
statute
effectuated
those
purposes.
under
the
present
social
security
program
there
is
absolutely
no
restriction
on
where
a
person
spends
their
money.
we
would
still
have
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
are
placing
as
to
whether
or
not
a
--
that
the
statute
--
would
the
statute
read
restricting
money
to
be
expended
within
the
united
states,
would
we
still
be
here?
i
think
we
would
still
have
to
look
to
the
degree
to
which
that
infringed
on
the
right
to
travel.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no,
i
do
not.
i
believe
that
this
court
could
examine
any
reasonable
goals
which
congress
may
have
intended
by
the
statute.
i
think
however
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no.
but
the
legislative
of
history
and
both
the
senate
report
which
are
cited
in
our
briefs,
in
both
the
senate
report
and
in
the
house
report,
they
state
and
unfortunately
there
are
only
about
two
sentences
which
described
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
but
in
both
the
senate
and
the
house
report,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
outlined
as
being
to
restrict
the
ssi
recipients
from
taking
on
residence
outside
the
united
states
for
one
month
or
longer.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
certainly
one
purpose
maybe
as
you
are
suggesting
to
limit
expenditures
of
ssi
money
within
the
united
states.
i
would
say
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
it
should
be
noted
however,
that
the
underlying
purpose
appears
to
be
a
legislative
judgment
that
ssi
programs,
a
need
base
program
which
is
adopted
to
levels
of
income
levels
of
cost
of
living,
etcetera
should
be
limited
to
persons
who
reside
within
the
united
states.
it's
interesting
to
that
the
congress
said
absolutely
nothing
about
expenditure.
what
they
limited
was
the
person's
ability
to
travel.
they
do
not
limit
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
absolutely
correct.
and
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
its
--
i
think
though
that
in
so
limiting
receipt
of
ssi
benefits.
again,
the
clear
purpose
of
congress
that
appears
to
have
been
to
limit
it
to
residence
within
united
states.
for
example
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no.
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
and
what
we're
requesting
this
court
to
come
to
conclusion
that
in
balancing
the
infringement
on
the
right
to
travel
that
the
statute
would
have
against
the
purpose
that
congress
was
attempting
to
achieve,
namely
to
limit
ssi
payments
to
persons
who
reside
within
the
united
states.
that
congress
simply
did
not
give
sufficient
concern
to
the
impact
on
the
right
to
travel.
they
did
not
for
example
limit
your
ability
if
you
live
anywhere
close
to
the
mexican
border
or
if
you
live
anywhere
close
to
the
canadian
border.
nothing
in
the
act,
anywhere
suggests
that
you
can
not
spend
your
entire
income
across
the
border.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
mean
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
oh,
i
see.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes,
i
see
what
you
mean
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no.
absolutely
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
your
honor,
we
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
examine
the
extent
of
the
infringement.
we
feel
that
the
secretary
can
and
he
already
does
because
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
absolutely
and
he
already
does.
your
honor,
the
secretary
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--
already
has
a
whole
series
of
objective
criteria
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
your
honor,
the
secretary
already
has
a
set
of
criteria
which
he
uses.
persons
who
are
going
to
travel
are
required
to
inform
the
secretary
that
they
intend
to
travel
and
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
he
is
--
they
are
required
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no,
because
we
do
not
feel
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
what
we're
arguing
your
honor
is
that
in
--
given
the
purposes
for
which
we
assume
and
government
statistics
appear
to
support
that
most
persons
travel.
and
in
1972,
a
government
study
and
unfortunately
the
most
recent
one
accomplished
indicate
that
50%
or
the
approximately
8
million
persons
who
travel
are
traveling
to
see
family
and
friends.
we
assume
that
elderly
ssi
recipients
for
the
most
part
are
not
traveling
for
business
reasons.
they're
traveling
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
there
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
your
honor,
i
would
agree.
i
would
think
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--
that
these
matters
should
have
been
considered
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
no.
we're
not
asking
you
to
rewrite
the
act,
your
honor.
we
are
asking
you
to
find
that
in
its
balancing
efforts
congress
did
not
give
sufficient
weight
to
the
infringement
that
this
statute
would
cause
on
the
right
to
travel.
we
--
your
previous
question
concerning
the
time,
the
secretary
already
has
alternative
means.
the
one
test
that
appears
over
and
over
again
in
kent,
in
aptheker,
in
zemel
is
--
are
there
alternative
means
other
--
does
the
government
have
alternative
means
for
accomplishing
the
same
purpose.
the
secretary
already
has
those
means
and
we
have
no
problems
with
them.
those
means
adopt
objective
criteria.
is
the
person
maintaining
a
home
in
the
united
states?
is
the
person's
family
remaining
in
the
united
states?
how
long
does
the
person
intent
to
travel
for?
does
the
person
have
a
return
ticket?
we
believe
that
those
objective
criteria
which
mandate
a
duty
that
the
secretary
has
a
separate
duty
under
a
separate
statute
section
1613
of
the
social
security
act
to
measure
residence.
that
duty
is
never
suspended
when
persons
come
back
to
the
united
states.
and
they
have
to
wait
that
additional
30
days
before
they
can
get
the
very
money
upon
which
they
survive.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
there
is
a
limit
on
the
earnings
and
i
believe
that
to
be
an
amount
substantially
less
than
the
current
grant
level
which
is
a
$189.00.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
your
honor,
the
recipient
has
a
statutory
duty
to
report
to
the
secretary
changes
in
circumstances
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
but
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
secretary
relies
on
the
assertions
of
the
recipient
in
order
to
fulfill
his
duties.
as
the
district
court
correctly
pointed
out
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
and
they
could
call
in
the
recipient
for
an
interview
and
they
could
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--
they
could
inquire
a
personal
interview
or
they
could
require
affidavits
from
other
persons
to
substantiate
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well
--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
your
honor
that
we
believe
that
clearly
at
some
point
travel
becomes
residents
abroad.
we
clearly
believe
and
the
secretary
has
regulations
already
adopted
to
meet
those
situations.
the
secretary
already
has
a
whole
set
of
objective
criteria
because
all
he
does
when
a
person
travels
for
30
days.
is
it
--
he
does
not
suspend
their
benefits.
he's
--
excuse
me,
he
does
not
terminate
their
benefits.
he
simply
suspends
them.
his
obligation
to
test
their
residency
is
maintained
throughout
their
travel
is
maintained
when
they
come
back.
he
says
and
the
secretary
admits
in
the
record
that
his
tests
are
“easy”
to
administer.
so
when
a
person
returns
to
the
united
states
and
they're
require
they
have
not
--
and
mrs.
aznavorian.
she
unexpectedly
becomes
ill.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
mrs.
aznavorian,
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
she
unexpectedly
becomes
ill.
she
knows
about
the
30-day
requirement.
she
returns
to
the
united
states
after
a
38-day
trip.
as
a
result,
she
loses
two
months
worth
of
benefits
which
she
relies
on
her
sole
income
which
pays
for
her
home,
her
shelter,
her
clothing
is
lost
for
two
months.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
we
believe
your
honor
that
at
a
certain
point
it
should
become
clear
to
the
secretary,
utilizing
the
objective
criteria
that
he
already
has
to
utilize
that
a
person
has
abandoned
their
residence
within
the
united
states.
residency
is
not
a
brand
new
concept
and
interestingly
enough
the
secretary
never
argues
anywhere
that
if
the
district
court's
opinion
is
upheld
that
he
will
be
incapable
of
determining
residence.
he
solely
argue
sovereign
immunity
because
he
already
has
the
test
to
determine
residency.
he
has
a
test
to
determine
the
acquisition
of
residency.
he
has
a
very
detailed
test
to
determine
the
abandonment
of
residency
as
to
the
point
that
mr.
chief
justice
raise
about
the
honesty
of
the
applicant.
the
district
court
recognized
as
this
court
recognized
in
a
number
of
other
cases
that
when
the
government
attempts
to
establish
a
bright
line
rule
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
fraud
which
is
one
of
the
primary
purposes
the
secretary
argues
here.
the
section
(inaudible)
prevents
fraud.in
this
case,
the
person
can
just
as
easily
be
dishonest
about
falling
under
the
bright
line
rule.
they
can
be
just
as
dishonest
about
that.
in
fact,
we
believe
it
would
be
far
easier
to
be
dishonest
about
whether
you
fall
into
the
bright
line
rule
than
it
would
be
to
be
dishonest
about
whether
or
not
you're
maintaining
a
residence
in
the
united
states.
that
would
surely
be
more
difficult
to
see
--
to
be
dishonest
about
because
they're
very
objective
criteria
which
can
be
looked
at.
so
in
order
to
prevent
dishonesty
in
the
program,
the
secretary
creates
this
rule
which
very
effectively
prevents
ssi
recipients,
elderly
persons
from
traveling
for
very,
very
personal
reasons.
and
yet,
the
rule
allows
persons
to
be
just
as
is
--
as
dishonest
as
to
whether
or
not
they
intend
to
leave
or
they
don't
intend
to
leave.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
