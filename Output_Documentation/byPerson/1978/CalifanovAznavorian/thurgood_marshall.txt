justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
equal
protection
you're
arguing
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
great
difficult
when
you
say
that
they
both
apply.
i
prefer
if
we
--
if
you'd
pick
one
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
but
that's
not
what
you're
arguing
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
we
can't
deal
with
highlights,
we
deal
with
statutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
wouldn't
aptheker
involve
prohibition,
complete
prohibition
that
you
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i'm
talking
about
aptheker.
justice
thurgood
marshall
aptheker
did
not
involve
complete
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
it
--
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
travel
without
a
passport?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
--
so
you'll
go
to
jail
if
you
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
people
do
you
think
had
committed
robberies
and
never
been
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
aptheker?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
what
international
travel
was
involved
in
that
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
maricopa
county
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
see
it,
get
back
a
moment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
right
to
travel.
the
--
as
i
read
this
statute,
it's
aimed
at
people
who
travel
in
light
and
remain
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
people
who
travel
light
and
remain.
you
wouldn't
say
that's
protected,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
person
who
moves
to
guadalajara
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
marries
and
lives
there
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
becomes
a
citizen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
didn't
--
that
isn't
protected
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
somebody
leaves
and
travels
to
mexico
and
stays
there
for
five
years,
is
that
protected
by
the
right
to
travel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
you
agree
that
the
secretary
can
look
into
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
try
to
limit
your
answers
to
the
length
of
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
far
can
the
secretary
go
in
order
to
inquire
into
whether
or
not
you
are
coming
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
doesn't
interfere
with
his
right
to
travel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
his
right
isn't
absolutely,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
you
arguing
if
it's
not
absolute
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
there
was
no
legislative
history
on
this
section?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
there
is,
then
why
do
you
argue
in
this
point,
if
you
don't
have
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
seems
to
me
this
is
something
--
should've
been
presented
to
congress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
--
so
rather
than
you
present
to
congress,
you're
going
to
present
it
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay,
that's
to
rewrite
the
act?
