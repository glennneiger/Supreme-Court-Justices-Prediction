we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
991
califano
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
buscemi,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
schey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
it
make
any
difference
what
the
factual
situation
is
in
that
respect
for
the
basic
question
before
the
court?
we
--
we
believe
it
does
make
a
difference
your
honor
because
these
persons,
many
of
these
persons,
elderly
persons
over
65
years
of
age
worked
arduously
throughout
their
lives
but
they
simply
were
unlucky
enough
not
to
work
in
the
right
kind
of
employment,
the
kind
of
employment
which
would
have
covered
them
under
title
ii
of
the
social
security
act.
had
they
engaged
in
employment
under
title
ii
with
the
social
security
act,
they
would
not
only
be
able
to
travel
freely
around
the
world,
they
would
be
able
to
reside
any
place
that
they
so
desired.

section

how
is
it
as
convenient
for

not

that
reply,
are
they?

is
not

of
some
other

receiving
several
thousand
dollars,
something

excessive
of
the
permissible
limit.
they
might
find
it
out
that
way,
am
i
--
is
that
not
so?
and
how
do
they
find
it
out
if
he
is
yugoslavia
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
or
in
the
soviet
union?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
make
any
difference
on
the
principles
you're
arguing
whether
its
38
