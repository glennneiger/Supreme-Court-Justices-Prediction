justice

r.
white
are
you
--
is
this
a
provision
or
isn't
that
equivalent
to
a
provision
that
would
say,
these
benefits
are
payable
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
spending
in
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
well,
would
it
be
equivalent
to
that
or
not?
would
you
be
making
the
same
arguments
if
the
statute
said
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
would
you
be
talking
about
you?
it
would
still
be
arguing
that
they
had
violated
the
--
what
you
call
the
--
a
right
to
travel?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
would
you
be
here
if
the
statutes
said
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
equal
protection
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
we
are
--
this
court
is
down
by
the
purposes
or
the
goals
that
the
government
professes
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
give
for
this
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
statute
on
its
face
doesn't
particularly
say,
does
it?
what
the
purpose
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
but
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
residence
outside
and
you
could
have
a
residence
requirement,
it's
a
lot
of
--
you
save
a
lot
of
money?
