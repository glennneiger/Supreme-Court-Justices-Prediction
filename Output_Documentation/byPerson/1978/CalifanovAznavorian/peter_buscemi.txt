mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
issue
in
these
consolidated
cases
is
whether
the
constitution
forbids
congress
from
providing
that
certain
federal
welfare
benefits
should
be
pay
only
for
those
months
during
which
the
recipient
is
in
the
united
states
for
at
least
part
of
the
month.
cases
are
here
on
appeal
from
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
named
appellee
in
77-991,
grace
aznavorian
receives
benefits
under
the
supplemental
security
income
program.
that
program
was
established
in
1972.
it
was
designed
to
consolidate
and
improve
upon
the
previously
existing
cooperative
federal
state
aide
programs
for
the
aged,
the
blind,
and
the
disabled.
the
social
security
administration
was
assigned
the
task
of
administrating
a
new
program
and
the
federal
government
agreed
to
bear
the
entire
cause
of
providing
basic
monthly
benefit
levels
for
persons
who
could
establish
financial
need
and
who
could
satisfy
the
requirements
of
aged,
blindness
or
disability
provided
in
the
statute.
the
benefit
levels
under
the
supplemental
security
income
program
are
set
by
reference
to
the
cost
of
living
in
the
united
states.
in
1974,
aznavorian's
monthly
benefits
were
a
$146.00
today
after
a
several
cost
of
living
increases
there
approximately
$190.00
a
month.
i'd
like
to
emphasis
to
the
outset
that
the
supplemental
security
income
program
involved
in
this
case
is
a
federal
welfare
program
involving
government
grants
to
persons
needing
public
financial
assistance
to
live
in
the
united
states.
it's
completely
unrelated
to
the
social
security
old
age,
survivors
and
disability
insurance
program.
unlike
that
program
which
is
funded
out
of
a
trust
fund
from
employer
and
employee
contributions
the
supplemental
security
income
program
is
funded
out
of
general
revenues
and
its
only
similarity
to
the
social
security
insurance
program
is
that
there
both
are
administered
by
the
social
security
administration.
aznavorian
began
receiving
benefits
in
january
1st,
1974,
the
date
that
the
ssi
program
became
effective.
she
was
converted
from
her
previous
coverage
under
a
california
welfare
program
for
the
disabled
and
therefore
she
began
receiving
benefits
immediately.
shortly
thereafter
on
july
21st,
1974,
she
left
the
united
states
and
travel
to
guadalajara,
mexico.
she
did
not
return
to
the
country
until
september
1st,
1974.
as
a
consequence
to
that
trip,
she
lost
her
ssi
benefits
for
august
and
september
of
1974.
the
social
security
administration
refused
to
pay
benefits
for
those
months
because
of
section
1611
(f)
of
the
social
security
act
which
is
the
statutory
provision
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
congress
adopted
section
1611
(f)
because
it
wanted
to
ensure
that
federal
welfare
benefits
were
paid
only
to
people
who
actually
need
them
to
live
in
united
states.
the
legislature
did
not
forbid
ssi
recipients
from
traveling
abroad
provided
only
that
where
otherwise
eligible
persons
decide
to
take
foreign
trips
for
an
extended
period
of
time
they
may
not
receive
welfare
benefits
for
the
time
they
are
outside
the
country.
this
purpose
to
provide
public
assistance
only
to
persons
who
need
it
to
support
themselves
in
united
states
is
accomplished
by
section
1611
(f).
that
section
contains
two
sentences.
the
first
sentence
provides,
“that
no
person
shall
be
considered
eligible
for
ssi
benefits
for
any
month
during
all
of
which
he
or
she
is
outside
the
united
states.”
aznavorian
lost
her
ssi
benefits
for
august
1974
because
of
the
operation
of
this
sentence.
the
second
sentence
of
section
1611
(f)
provides,
“that
once
an
otherwise
eligible
recipient
is
outside
the
country
for
30
consecutive
days,
he
is
treated
as
remaining
outside
the
country
until
he
has
returned
to
united
states
and
stayed
here
for
30
consecutive
days.”
aznavorian
lost
her
benefits
for
september
1974
because
of
the
operation
of
this
second
sentence.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
one
thing
clear
about
the
way
the
second
sentence
of
section
1611
(f)
operates
before
i
go
any
further.
if
a
person
is
outside
the
country
for
30
consecutive
days,
he
is
treated
as
remaining
outside
the
country
until
he's
returned
and
stayed
in
united
states
for
30
consecutive
days.
but
this
does
not
mean
that
he
cannot
receive
ssi
benefits
for
any
of
that
30-day
waiting
period.
if
the
30-day
waiting
period
expires
before
the
end
of
the
month,
the
person
can
receive
his
full
ssi
benefits
for
that
month.
thus,
a
person
who
leaves
for
example
on
june
10th
and
returns
to
united
states
on
july
20th.
if
he's
still
in
the
country
on
august
19th,
30
days
later,
he'll
receive
benefits
for
the
full
month
of
august.
the
provision
is
designed
only
to
equalize
treatment
between
people
who
are
outside
the
country
for
a
full
calendar
month
and
those
who
are
out
for
a
period
longer
than
30
days
which
spans
two
calendar
months
and
therefore
therein
the
country
for
part
of
each.
mr.
peter
buscemi
in
my
hypothetical,
yes.
he
would
loose
benefits
only
for
the
month
of
july.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
he
was
outside
the
country
for
20
days
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--
and
then
the
remaining
10
days
of
the
month,
to
the
remaining
11
days
of
the
month,
he
is
treated
as
being
outside
the
country
under
the
second
sentence
of
section
1611
(f).
mr.
peter
buscemi
now,
it's
the
secretary's
position
that
section
1611
(f)
is
rationally
related
to
the
legitimate
government
purpose
of
limiting
welfare
payments
to
persons
who
actually
need
them
to
live
in
the
united
states.
appellees
in
the
district
court
believe
however
that
the
operation
of
section
1611
(f)
involves
an
unconstitutional
infringement
on
the
right
to
travel
outside
the
united
states.
appellees
after
exhausting
their
available
administrative
remedies
filed
as
class
action
and
allege
that
the
suspension
of
ssi
benefits
to
otherwise
eligible
recipients
who
are
outside
the
country
for
30
or
more
consecutive
days
is
an
improper
penalty
on
the
exercise
of
what
she
called
the
fundamental
constitutional
right
to
foreign
travel.
the
district
court
did
not
completely
accept
appellee's
position.
it
observed
that
international
travel
has
traditionally
been
subject
to
more
controls
to
interstate
travel
and
said
that
the
right
to
travel
internationally
should
not
be
equated
or
put
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
right
to
travel
interstate.
however
the
court
did
decide
that
the
right
to
international
travel
is
a
basic
constitutional
right
and
therefore
that
any
governmental
restriction,
no
matter
how
minor
on
such
travel
must
bear
a
fair
and
substantial
relationship
to
a
legitimate
government
purpose.
the
court
concluded
that
congress
could
have
chosen
less
drastic
means
to
prevent
fraudulent
claims
for
ssi
benefits
and
to
ensure
that
such
benefits
are
paid
only
to
united
states
residence.
the
court
therefore
declared
section
1611
(f)
unconstitutional
and
directed
the
secretary
to
pay
aznavorian
the
benefit
she
would
have
received
in
august
of
9th
--
and
september
1974
had
it
not
been
for
her
trip
to
mexico.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
erred
in
applying
this
unusually
stringent
standard
of
review
to
section
1611
(f).
the
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
statutory
classifications
of
this
kind
in
social
welfare
programs
should
be
sustained
if
they
bear
a
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose.
indeed,
in
califano
against
jobst
decided
just
last
term
the
court
may
clear
that
the
validity
of
a
particular
classification
must
be
measured
against
the
rational
base
standard
even
if
the
classification
may
have
some
incidental
effect
on
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
in
that
case,
the
right
to
marry.
another
case
decided
last
term,
califano
against
gautier
torres,
demonstrates
the
district
court's
error
in
this
case
in
a
signing
a
special
constitutional
status
to
the
right
to
travel
abroad.
as
the
court
said
in
gautier
torres,
the
right
to
international
travel
does
not
enjoy
the
same
degree
of
constitutional
protection
as
the
right
to
travel
interstate.
the
right
to
travel
outside
the
country
is
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
such
can
be
regulated
within
the
bounds
of
due
process.
the
statement
runs
directly
counted.
we
submit
to
the
district
court's
holding
in
this
case.
now,
the
district
court
cites
three
supreme
court
cases
for
its
proposition
that
in
a
specially
strong
showing
is
required
to
justify
any
infringement
on
the
right
travel
abroad.
none
of
those
cases
support
the
result
reached
below.
kent
against
dulles,
the
first
of
the
cases,
was
a
statutory
interpretation
case
that
simply
held
that
the
secretary
of
state
did
not
have
the
power
under
the
statutes
passed
in
1952
and
1956
to
deny
passport
solely
on
the
basis
of
personal
beliefs,
political
views,
political
expressions.
aptheker
against
the
secretary
of
state
recognized
congress'
right
to
regulate
travel
abroad
but
simply
held
that
a
particular
exercise
of
that
power,
the
subversive
activities
control
act
went
too
far
by
making
it
a
crime
for
any
member
of
any
communist
organization
to
use
or
even
apply
for
a
passport.
and
finally,
zemel
against
rusk
sited
by
appellees
in
a
district
court
not
only
acknowledge
the
congressional
power
to
regulate
travel
outside
the
country
but
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
passport
act
of
1926
to
the
extent
that
it
was
interpreted
to
permit
the
secretary
of
state
to
refuse
to
validate
passports
for
persons
who
want
to
travel
to
particular
countries
if
the
secretary
found
that
such
travel
might
be
injurious
to
american
foreign
policy
positions.
in
none
of
those
cases
that
the
court
indicated
that
there
was
a
special
standard
that
needed
to
applied
any
time
there
was
an
infringement
on
the
right
to
travel
abroad.
its
worth
pointing
out
i
think
that
section
1611
(f)
does
not
prohibit
any
foreign
travel.
it's
absolutely
neutral
with
respect
to
trips
of
30
days
or
less.
and
with
respect
to
longer
trips,
the
congress
has
chosen
to
provide
only
that
no
ssi
benefits
will
be
paid
for
months
during
all
of
which
the
recipient
is
outside
the
country.
as
a
practical
matter
of
course,
the
ssi
recipient's
ability
to
travel
abroad
for
lengthy
period
is
--
periods
is
limited
by
financial
factors
that
are
unrelated
to
section
1611
(f).
in
order
to
receive
ssi
benefits
at
all,
the
recipient
must
demonstrate
that
he
has
less
than
$1500
in
personal
resources.
foreign
trips
lasting
longer
than
the
30-day
period
are
unlikely
to
be
within
financial
reach
of
most
ssi
recipients.
and
if
such
trips
are
made
possible
in
some
cases
by
the
availability
of
accommodations
with
friends
or
relatives
outside
the
country,
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
situation
in
which
the
payment
of
ssi
benefits
to
persons
outside
the
country
would
be
inappropriate.
we
believe
as
i
said
before
that
section
1611
(f)
is
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
congressional
goal
providing
financial
aide
to
persons
who
need
it
to
live
in
united
states.
we
also
think
as
we've
stated
in
the
brief
that
is
related
to
the
purpose
of
paying
ssi
benefits
only
to
united
states
residents,
a
purpose
that
appellees
concede
as
a
legitimate
one.
section
1611
(f)
makes
it
unnecessary
for
the
social
security
administration
to
decide
each
time
a
recipient
leaves
the
country
whether
that
person
is
abandoning
his
united
states
residence.
the
social
security
administration
simply
stops
payments
after
the
recipient
has
been
outside
the
country
for
a
full
month.
and
we
believe
that
this
is
a
rational
legislative
judgment
that
should
be
upheld.
now,
we've
also
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
district
court's
--
a
word
of
retroactive
monetary
relief
was
improper
because
congress
did
not
choose
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
claims
that
benefits
were
unconstitutionally
denied
under
--
even
when
they
were
denied
under
a
statutory
--
in
accordance
with
a
statutory
provision.
we've
also
argued
that
the
district
court's
limitation
of
the
relief
to
--
in
currently
needy
members
of
the
class
was
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
district
court's
equitable
discretion.
unless
the
court
has
questions
on
first
part
of
the
brief
or
any
of
these
other
two,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i'd
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions
that
the
court
has
but
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
at
this
time.
