justice
potter
stewart
in
your
hypothetical
case,
he
would
loose
benefits
for
one
month
only,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
talk
about
the
right
to
travel,
so
that's
established
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that
there
is
a
right
of
international
travel,
that's
one
of
the
contested
issues
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
one
who
many
years
ago
was
influenced
in
his
legal
education
by
somebody
who
nobody's
heard
of
anymore,
professor
hofeld,
i've
often
been
concerned
about
this
throwing
around
loosely
of
the
word
“right”
or
if
somebody
has
a
right,
somebody
on
the
other
side
must
have
a
duty.
now,
its
been
held
hasn't
it
that
at
least
in
some
cases
that
the
international
travel
by
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
a
resident
of
the
united
states
is
no
more
than
a
freedom,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
as
contrasted
with
interstate
travel
which
has
been
established
as
a
constitutional
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
doesn't
talk
about
rights,
it
talks
about
liberties
and
liberty
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
a
synonym
for
freedom.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
that's
directly
from
shelton
against
tucker
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
times
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
claims
in
right
here.
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all,
you
have
to
find
a
right
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
accepted
by
the
constitution.
now
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
are
you
suggesting
that
the
freedom
of
that
--
to
leave
our
country
and
travel
internationally
is
precise
equivalent
of
the
right
to
travel
from
state
to
state?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
quite
different,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
unthinkable
that
a
passport
could
be
required
if
travel
from
new
york
to
ohio
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
yet,
it's
accepted
that
a
passport
is
required
to
travel
from
new
york
to
france,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
what
--
from
much
you've
just
--
the
way
you've
just
answered
my
question,
you
would
--
can
say
that
that
was
mistaken
or
to
loose
from
the
part
of
those
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
cross-appeals
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
in
1972,
congress
enacted
the
supplemental
security
income
program
to
aid
the
needy
who
are
aged,
blind,
or
disabled.
the
legislation
creating
the
program
provides
that
benefits
are
not
to
be
paid
for
any
month
that
the
recipient
spends
entirely
outside
of
the
united
states.
the
primary
issue
in
these
cases
is
whether
as
the
district
court
held,
this
restriction
is
constitutionally
impermissible
burden
on
the
asserted
right
of
international
travel.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
this
provision
of
the
law
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
brennan
have
filed
a
statement
concurring
in
the
result.
