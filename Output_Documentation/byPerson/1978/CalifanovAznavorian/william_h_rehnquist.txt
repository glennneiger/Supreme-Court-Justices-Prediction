justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
reference
to
the
kent,
and
aptheker,
and
zemel
cases
which
are
obviously
in
controversy
here
between
you
and
your
opponents
brings
to
my
mind
this
question
which
is
highlighted
by
the
language
on
page
16
of
381
u.
s.
from
zemel
against
rusk
were
the
court
says
that
the
claim
is
different
from
that
which
is
raised
in
kent
and
from
aptheker
for
the
refusal
to
validated
appellant's
passport
does
not
result
from
many
expression
or
association
on
his
part.
don't
you
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
all
three
of
those
cases
did
have
some
sort
of
first
amendment
overtones
to
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
also
rather
specifically
limited
the
person's
right
to
receive
funds
when
they
are
outside
the
country,
didn't
they?
which
is
certainly
one
of
the
purposes
congress
had
in
mind
that
if
a
person
stayed
outside
the
country
more
than
30
days
that
person
would
not
receive
social
security
benefits.
congress
has
expressed
that
purpose
in
so
many
words
in
the
statute
you're
challenging.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
certainly
that
fulfills
congress'
purpose,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
do
we
need
to
worry
about
what
it
appears
to
be
when
we
have
it
(inaudible)
--
spelled
out
in
so
many
words
in
this
statute
that
you're
challenging.
do
you
think
congress
just
--
kind
of
in
a
fit
of
absentmindedness
pass
this
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
argument
isn't
based
on
failure
of
this
particular
statute
you're
challenging
to
conform
to
the
overall
congressional
purpose.
that's
based
on
your
--
i
mean
violates
a
constitutional
substantive
right.
