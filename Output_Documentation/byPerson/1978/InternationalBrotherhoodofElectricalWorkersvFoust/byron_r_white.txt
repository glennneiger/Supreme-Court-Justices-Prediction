justice
byron
r.
white
in
adjudicating
this
case,
do
you
understand
that
we
shouldn't
do
so
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
breach
of
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
i
don't
think
this
is
the
same
question.
do
you
think
that
there
is
open
in
this
court
the
question
of
whether
that
was
a
wrongful
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
how
about
the
union?
i
would
suppose
that
i'll
just
ask
you
this,
suppose
it's
--
would
punitive
damages
ever
be,
even
if
they
were
allowable
in
the
proper
case,
would
punitive
damages
be
allowable
if
there
had
been
no
injury?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
well
then
what
i
want
to
know
is,
is
the
question
of
wrongful
discharged
open
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
must
assume
there
was
a
wrongful
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
judge
the
case
here
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
both
a
wrongful
discharge
and
a
breach
of
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
language
you
just
referred
to
literally
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
vaca
said
that
the
damage
was
caused
by
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
a
while
ago
you
indicated
you
didn't
think
punitive
damages,
it
should
be
allowed
if
there
were
no
damages
caused
by
the
person
i
guess
whom
damages
are
sought.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
was
the
situation
in
vaca?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
you
have
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
statement
that
no
punitive
damages
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
ever
determined
by
anybody
in
this
case
whether
there
had
been
a
wrongful
discharge
that
wasn't
submitted
to
the
jury,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
had
kept
it
from
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
about
â€“
i'm
just
curious
about
recovering
from
an
union
substantial
damages,
particularly
punitive
damages
without
a
determination
that
there
had
been
a
wrongful
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
foust,
i
would
--
suppose
that
it
had
been
determined
in
this
case
that
there
hadn't
been
a
wrongful
discharge,
but
nevertheless
a
breach
of
duty
by
the
union,
what
would
have
been
the
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
apparently,
there
was
never
any
objection
in
this
case
at
all
the
instruction,
keeping
that
issue
from
the
jury
as
to
the
wrongfulness
of
the
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
301
law,
is
it
clear
that
there
no
punitive
damages
ever
allowed?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
against
employers?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
punitive
damages
against
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
has
it
been
raised
and
then
rejected
or
not?
