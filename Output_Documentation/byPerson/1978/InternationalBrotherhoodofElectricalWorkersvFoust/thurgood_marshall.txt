justice
thurgood
marshall
he
knew
that,
didn't
he?
he
knew
that
the
attorney
mailed
the
letter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
would
have
been
horrible
if
he
knew
it
was
untimely,
and
then
wrote
a
letter
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
cohen,
is
there
any
record
of
the
grievance
being
filed
out
of
time
and
having
been
considered
in
this
particular
shop?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
50
times
before
a
grievance
filed
two
days
later
had
been
considered,
that
would
be
one
thing,
if
it
were
uniform
and
never
considered,
wouldn't
it
be
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
mackey
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
that
transpired
before
the
letter
was
written,
the
late
letter,
could
your
client
had
recovered
damages
from
the
union?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
all
of
that
good
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
all
of
that
good
for
us
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he'll
sue
for
any
kind
of
damages,
but
he
couldn't
sue
for
that.
i
mean
the
way
these
unions
operate
back
and
forth,
you
can't
go
to
court
everyday
on
those,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
i
mean
his
lawyer
tells
you
what
you
can
do
with
your
paper?
you
can't
carry
that
to
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
wouldn't
–
and
certainly
couldn't
have
gotten
punitive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
an
unfettered
state
employer
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
he
have
a
state
implied
right
under
common
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
have
a
state
implied
right
under
union
contract;
he
wouldn't
have
had
a
common
law
–
