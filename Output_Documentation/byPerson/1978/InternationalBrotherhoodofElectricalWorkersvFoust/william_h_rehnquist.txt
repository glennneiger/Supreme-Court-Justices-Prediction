justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
jury--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
a
little
difficulty
with
that
position.
perhaps
the
difficult
stems
from
my
own
lack
of
understanding.
to
me
those
acts
place
the
employee
and
the
union
on
one
side
of
the
fence
and
the
employer
on
the
other
and
when
the
court
has
interpreted
to
say
they're
remedial
and
you
can
only
get
so
much
out
of
the
employer
by
virtue
of
it,
but
when
you're
talking
about
a
union
which
is
basically
supposed
to
be
representing
the
employee,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
necessarily
have
the
same
limits
as
you
would
in
the
remedies
against
the
employer
if
there
is
almost
a
fiduciary
obligation
involved.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
does
it
necessarily
follow,
because
a
union
can't
be
punished
for
violation
of
a
practice
made
unfair
by
the
act
of
1947
and
an
employee
or
employer
can't
be
punished
by
the
for
the
act
of
1935
violation,
that
a
union
representing
an
employee
and
processing
a
grievance
can
--
is
likewise
limited
in
the
damage
that
can
be
awarded?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
mackey
is
your
theory
that
your
punitive
damages
can
be
awarded
to
you
under
these
state
law
of
wyoming
and
that
congress
has
not
forbidden
it
in
the
labor
act
or
that
your
claim
arises
for
any
sort
of
damages
against
the
union
arises
out
of
the
labor
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
it's
more
important
than
picking
names.
i
had
understood
that
your
claim
was
based
on
a
federal
statutory
claim
such
as
i
understood
vaca
versus
sipes
to
be.
but
your
last
few
sentences
of
argument
made
me
think
that
your
urgings
that
this
was
sort
of
common
law
type
of
thing
that
congress
simply
hadn't
preempted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
never
have
any
cause
of
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen
i
notice
on
page
seven
of
the
appendix
where
the
amended
complaint
is
set
out,
that
paragraph,
one
of
the
complaints
is
phrased
in
terms
of
diversity
jurisdiction
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
rather
than
federal
question
jurisdiction.
do
you
think
that
a
person
in
mr.
foust's
position
would
have
a
right
to
sue
under
diversity
jurisdiction
in
state
courts
for
a
common
law
type
of
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
sections
are
too
much,
well
i'm
still
at
the
dear
sir
and
brother
stage
of
my
knowledge
of
labor
law.
