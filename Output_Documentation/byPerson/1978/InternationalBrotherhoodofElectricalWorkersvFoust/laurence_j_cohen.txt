mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
under
the
railway
labor
act.
in
the
district
court,
the
jury
found
that
the
union
had
breached
its
duty
to
mr.
foust.
it
awarded
compensatory
damages
of
$40,000
and
punitive
damages
of
$75,000.
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
in
all
respects.
this
court
denied
certiorari
on
two
of
the
issues
raised
in
our
petition
whether
the
union
had
breached
its
duty
as
a
matter
of
law
and
whether
the
award
of
compensatory
damages
was
proper.
the
single
issue
on
which
certiorari
was
granted,
was
the
propriety
of
the
punitive
damage
award.
the
basis
for
the
lower
court's
finding
that
the
union
had
breached
its
duty
to
foust
was
the
fact
that
it
filed
a
grievance
on
his
behalf,
two
days
after
the
expiration
of
the
60-day
grievance
period
provided
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
ultimate
denial
of
that
grievance
by
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
the
facts
underlying
the
filing
of
the
grievance
are
basically
undisputed
and
can
be
summarized
briefly.
foust
was
an
employee
of
the
union
pacific
railroad
and
he
was
represented
by
the
ibew
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
in
march
of
1970,
he
was
injured
on
the
job.
he
took
several
succeeding
medical
leaves
of
absence,
the
last
of
which
expired
december
22,
1970.
he
did
not
file
a
timely
request
for
a
further
extension
of
his
leave
of
absence.
and
on
february
3,
1971,
the
railroad
wrote
to
foust
and
stated
that
he
was
discharged
for
his
failure
to
do
so
and
his
failure
to
submit
a
required
physician
statement.
now
under
this
court's
decision
in
elgin,
joliet
&
eastern
railway
against
burley,
foust
at
that
point
had
the
option
of
proceeding
on
his
own
to
file
a
grievance
or
asking
that
it
be
handled
by
his
union
or
by
an
attorney.
he
chose
to
use
the
attorney,
who
was
then
representing
him
in
his
personal
injury
claim
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act
and
on
february
11,
his
attorney
wrote
to
the
railroad
concerning
the
discharge.
the
letter
went
unanswered
and
he
got
no
favorable
response
in
two
subsequent
phone
calls
to
the
railroad.
on
march
26,
which
was
the
51st
day
of
the
grievance
period,
the
attorney
wrote
to
the
union,
the
union
representative
jones,
and
asked
that
the
union
attempt
to
have
jones,
excuse
me,
foust
reinstated.
jones
considered
the
request
unusual,
since
it
came
not
from
the
employee
the
union
represented
but
from
his
attorney.
so
he
called
his
superior.
they
discussed
the
matter
and
concluded
they
needed
an
authorization
from
foust
himself
to
proceed,
and
the
superior
prepared
a
letter
for
jones
to
send
to
foust.
he
mailed
that
letter
to
jones,
who
dated
and
signed
it
and
he
mailed
it
to
foust
on
april
the
5th.
in
essence,
the
letter
said
we
need
a
written
authorization
from
you
to
handle
this
matter
on
your
behalf.
he
didn't
wait
for
a
response.
however,
on
the
following
day,
april
6,
he
filed
a
grievance.
that
however
was
two
days
after
the
60-day
period.
i
would
like
to
mention
two
other
factual
points.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
it's
not
entirely
clear,
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
his
deposition,
he
said
i
feel
at
that
time
that
it
was
untimely.
we
don't
deny
that
he
should
have
known
it
was
untimely.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
no.
it's
my
understanding
of
the
record
that
he
–
that
it's
simply
not
clear
that
he
did
know
it
at
that
time.
foust
admitted
that
he
made
no
effort
between
february
3rd,
the
date
of
his
discharge
and
april
5th
to
contact
the
union
personally.
he
also
acknowledged
that
there
was
no
animosity,
or
adverse,
or
bad
relationship
between
them.
his
only
complaint
was
that
the
union
was
late
in
filing
his
grievance.
now
our
principal
position
here
is
that
punitive
damages
are
not
a
proper
remedy
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
that
is
because
a
duty
of
fair
representation
suit
is
one
to
enforce
a
statutory
right
and
the
remedy
for
violation
of
that
right
must
also
be
drawn
from
the
statute.
specifically,
the
question
of
whether
punitive
damages
are
allowable
in
a
fair
representation
case,
we
feel
must
be
determined
by
the
national
labor
policy,
the
best
evidence
of
which
is
found
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
under
which
there
are
many
more
precedents
than
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
think
you
must,
mr.
justice
white.
with
the
denial
of
certiorari
on
that
issue,
for
purposes
of
this
court
the
breach
is
established.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
let
me
try
to
answer
that
this
way.
foust
settled
with
the
railroad
both
for
his
personal
injury
claim
and
waived
any
claim
on
wrongful
discharge
before
this
suit
was
filed.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
no.
i
think
not.
i
think
that
is
the
very
least
that
is
clear
from
vaca.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
we
feel
it
is
not
open.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
think
so.
i
think
the
union
unfortunately
below
did
not
accept
to
the
instructions
that
the
jury
should
not
consider
that
issue.
we
feel
in
a
proper
case
as
we
read
this
court's
decisions,
both
elements
must
be
approved.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
if
certiorari
had
not
been
denied
on
that
i
would
certainly
think
so.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
that
is
our
principal
position
just
as
in
a
303
action,
which
is
also
an
action
for
a
statutory
tort,
no
matter
how
willful
or
even
vicious,
as
this
court
held
in
teamsters
v.
morton
only
remedial
sanctions
are
provided.
of
course,
we
do
make
the
alternative
argument,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
on
the
record
of
this
case,
if
the
court
does
not
accept
our
principal
position,
the
standard
used
by
the
tenth
circuit
is
far
lacking
the
requirements
of
the
prevailing
standard
for
punitive
damages.
we
submit
that
the
--
on
the
principal
position
that
the
federal
labor
policy,
which
underlies
these
statutes
is
one
of
providing
exclusively
remedial
relief
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
was
established
as
early
as
the
republic
steel
case
we
cite,
where
chief
justice
hughes
noted
that
the
act
contained
only
remedial
and
not
punitive
relief,
and
he
noted
that
the
deterrent
effect
of
punitive
action
was
not
a
sufficient
justification
for
such
sanctions.
those
principles
have
been
reiterated
trough
the
years.
in
this
court
for
example
in
the
carpenters
local
60
case
by
you
mr.
chief
justice,
when
writing
for
the
dc
circuit
in
the
ladies
garment
worker's
case
we
cite
at
page
15,
the
same
result
obtains
under
the
forty-seventh
amendment,
the
lmra,
i
just
mentioned
teamsters
versus
morton
which
is
an
explicit
holding,
also
under
301
a
breach
of
contract
action
where
the
leading
case
is
the
brooke
shoe
decision
which
we
cite
where
chief
judge
biggs
i
think
succinctly
summed
up
both
the
correct
result
and
the
reason
for
that
result,
“it
is
a
general
policy
of
the
federal
labor
laws
to
which
the
federal
courts
are
to
look
for
guidance
in
section
301
actions,
to
supply
remedies
rather
then
punishments.
”now
it
appears
to
us
that
this
court
reached
the
same
conclusion
in
this
very
context
in
vaca
versus
sipes.
after
noting
that
the
jury
there
had
awarded
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
the
court
held
“such
damages
are
not
recoverable
from
the
union
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.”
the
court
then
went
on
to
discuss
the
fact
that
any
compensatory
damages
that
were
due
if
the
union
had
breached
its
duty,
would
have
been
attributable
to
the
wrongful
discharge
by
the
employer.
now
the
ninth
circuit
has
interpreted
vaca
as
we
do
as
holding
the
punitive
damages
are
strictly
unavailable
in
fair
representation
cases.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
well
we
offer
mr.
justice
white,
two
possible
explanations
for
that
language
in
our
brief.
we
acknowledge
that
an
alternative
basis
maybe
that
you
may
not
have
them,
if
there
are
no
or
almost
no
compensatory
damages.
we
think
the
broader
holding
is
the
better
reading,
but
i
would
certainly
argue
with
you
as
to
--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
if
the
issue
were
open
here
mr.
justice
white,
we
would
argue
that
the
award
of
compensatory
damages
against
the
union
was
plainly
improper.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
that's
right.
in
effect
we
paid
–-
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
--
wrong
discharge
here.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
that's
right.
we
think
that
vaca
can
be
read
either
more
broadly
yes,
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
read
it
that
way.
obviously
of
course
we
point
out
the
matter
is
open.
as
far
as
the
railway
labor
act
itself,
probably
the
most
thorough
analysis
of
its
structure
was
provided
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
deboles
case
which
we
cite
at
pages
12,
13
and
24
and
25
of
our
brief.
in
which
after
examining
the
precedents
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
structure
of
the
railway
labor
act,
the
court
concluded
“there
is
no
intention
that
the
railway
labor
act
deviates
from
this
general
pattern
of
remedies
under
the
nlra,
at
least
with
respect
to
union
misconduct.”
the
same
conclusion
had
been
reached
in
another
railway
labor
act
case
many
years
earlier
in
judge
taylor
bright's
opinion
in
brady
versus
twa.
now
we
think
it's
significant
in
looking
at
the
railway
labor
act,
that
under
the
provisions
of
section
2
(tenth)
the
criminal
sanctions
which
are
provided
for
willful
carrier
violations
of
five
specified
paragraphs,
do
not
encompass
the
duties
which
are
declared
in
paragraphs
first
and
second
from
which
this
court
has
said
the
duty
of
fair
representation
arises.
so
we
feel
if
the
test
is
the
national
labor
policy
that
the
conclusion
must
be
reached
that
punitive
damages
are
not
allowable
for
any
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
or
wrongful
discharge.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
well
we
think
again
though
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
scheme
of
the
statues
and
even
when
congress
amended
the
act
in
1947
to
provide
union
unfair
labor
practices
it
made
no
change
in
its
for
remedial
policy
and
this
court's
decision
in
carpenters
local
60
in
1961
was
a
case
where
a
remedy
which
this
court
held
punitive
was
imposed
on
a
union
based
on
its
action
vis-à-vis
the
employees
it
represented
and
this
court
held
the
douze
reimbursement
remedy
in
that
case
was
punitive
and
could
not
stand.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
we
think
that
conclusion
does
follow
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
the
entire
statutory
scheme
is
one
of
deliberately
providing
only
remedial
relief,
and
in
that
case
where
the
courts
have
implied
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
we
think
it
would
be
a
quantum
leap
for
the
courts
to
provide
something
far
beyond
anything
contemplated
by
the
congress
anywhere
in
this
related
group
of
statues.
we
think,
the
same
approach
or
the
same
result
obtains
under
a
different
approach,
a
more
general
statutory
approach
which
we
suggest,
in
which
we
draw
from
judge
parker's
decision
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
mine
workers
versus
patton.
we
cite
that
at
some
detail
in
our
brief.
we
also
in
our
reply
brief
cite
the
phelps
dodge
case,
where
this
court
held
that
even
in
the
flagrant
case
of
a
deliberately
discriminatory
refusal
to
hire
based
on
union
membership,
a
violation
that
is
both
willful
and
one
that
runs
to
the
heart
of
the
act,
no
more
than
a
make
hold
order
was
appropriate
and
we
think
under
either
the
specific
or
the
more
general
standard
that
we
advance
the
conclusion
should
be
reached
that
neither
employers
nor
unions
in
these
wrongful
discharge
duty
of
fair
representation
cases
should
be
subject
to
the
threat
of
punitive
damages.
if
the
court
does
not
accept
that
basic
position,
that
punitive
damages
are
never
available
in
fair
representation
cases.
we
think
that
the
filing
of
foust
grievance
two
days
out
of
time
is
not
a
legally
sufficient
basis
to
support
the
award
in
this
case.
that
is
because
the
prevailing
requirement
as
we
understand
it
for
an
award
of
punitive
damages
is
some
showing
of
malice
or
willful
or
outrageous
misconduct
as
opposed
to
a
showing
of
negligence.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i'm
not
sure,
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
considered?
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
don't
think
there
is
any
such
showing
here.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
one
way
or
the
other.
to
the
extent
that
it
is
relevant
jones
the
first
level
union
representative
testified
that
in
his
three
years
in
that
position,
he
had
handled
seven
or
eight
grievances,
each
had
come
directly
from
the
employee
involved,
there
was
no
indication
that
there
was
any
problem
with
timeliness
and
he
then
went
on
to
state
that
it
was
because
this
case
was
different
that
he
took
the
time
to
check
with
his
superior
and
the
letters
when
back
and
forth.
we
have
set
forth
a
number
of
cases
including
this
court's
decision
only
last
term
in
carey
versus
piphus
which
seems
to
require
as
we
suggest
a
showing
of
some
sort
of
malicious
intention
or
deliberate
violence
or
oppression,
i
won't
go
into
all
of
those
here,
they
are
set
out
in
our
brief,
as
it
is
dean
prosser's
work.
in
fact
the
court
below
seemed
to
be
aware
that
it
was
using
a
lesser
standard
than
some
of
the
other
courts
including
those
on
which
it
had
purported
to
rely,
but
it
didn't
explain
why
its
lesser
standard
might
be
correct.
now
when
it
looked
at
the
facts
here,
the
tenth
circuit
noted
“the
time
available
to
the
union
was
limited.”
and
it
was
limited
because
foust's
prior
attorney
used
up
52
of
the
60
days
available,
but
the
court
nevertheless
faulted
the
union
for
engaging
in
what
it
called
‘needless
correspondence
back
and
forth'
during
the
remaining
eight
days
and
for
insisting
on
an
authorization
from
foust.
so
at
most
and
in
the
tenth
circuit's
own
view,
the
union
was
guilty
of
negligence
or
an
error
of
law
or
of
judgment,
which
does
not
even
approach
the
kind
of
malicious
or
willful
misconduct,
which
is
required
to
support
the
punitive
damage
award.
i
would
like
to
add
a
final
word
in
that
regard.
this
court's
last
statement
on
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
in
hines
versus
anchor
motor
freight.
and
one
of
the
points
made
there
was
that
a
mere
error
of
judgment
was
not
sufficient
to
find
a
breach
of
the
duty.
well,
we
may
not
argue
that
here,
but
i
would
submit
that
if
it
is
not
adequate
to
find
a
breach
of
the
duty
and
that
is
in
essence
what
happened
here,
it
a
fortiori
is
not
sufficient
to
support
an
award
of
punitive
damages.
on
either
of
the
basis
therefore,
we
think
the
judgment
of
awarding
punitive
damages
should
be
reversed
and
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'll
save
my
remaining
time.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
comment
on
two
factual
aspects.
my
opponent
has
referred
to
the
matter
of
the
1970
grievance,
which
mr.
foust
attempted
to
file.
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
i
think
it
has
no
bearing
whatever
on
the
late
filing
of
the
discharge
claim,
but
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
record.
what
is
revealed
is
that
after
his
injury
in
march
of
1970,
mr.
foust
was
withheld
for
several
days
from
work
by
the
company's
doctor
and
he
felt
he
should
have
been
paid
for
those
days.
he
sent
a
written
grievance
to
the
union
dated
june
17,
1970
that
time
he
did
it
by
himself.
the
union
representatives
conferring
among
themselves,
concluded
that
this
was
not
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
contract,
but
grew
out
of
the
injury
claim,
which
had
to
be
handled
with
an
entirely
separate
department
of
the
railroad
outside
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
in
terms
of
whether
mr.
jones
contacted
mr.
foust,
the
record
shows
that
he
contacted
him
on
two
occasions
by
telephone.
in
his
april
9,
1971
letter
to
foust,
he
refers
to
the
june
17,
1970
grievance
and
notes
that
i
stated
to
you
by
telephone
at
that
time,
that
there
are
no
provisions
by
agreement,
by
the
agreement
for
filing
claims
due
to
medical
reasons
or
injuries
and
he
suggested
that
this
had
to
be
pursued
under
the
fela,
that's
page
14(a)
of
respondents
brief.
in
mr.
moriadi
(ph),
that
is
mr.
foust
prior
attorney
letter
to
jones
of
november
19,
1970,
i'm
sorry
it's
the
january
11,
1971
letter,
he
refers
to
an
additional
phone
call
between
them
on
december,
8.
the
only
points
i
wish
to
make
on
this
are
that,
the
matter
was
not
ignored
and
that
the
union
representatives
concluded
as
a
matter
of
substance
that
it
related
to
a
matter
outside
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
would
not
think
so.
i
think
this
is
a
federal
question
type
of
jurisdiction.
as
far
as
the
former
–-
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
no
it
did
not.
that
question
really
was
not
raised
anywhere
below.
my
only
comment
on
what
i
think
is
a
completely
untenable
comparison
with
farmer
is
to
say
that
if
one
reads
the
rather
outrageous
facts
in
that
case
against
the
failure
by
two
days
to
file
a
grievance
on
time
here,
the
disparate
of
the
two
cases
is
quickly
apparent.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
yes,
that
is
correct.
it
has
no
relevance
here
whatever.
i
was
slightly
offended
at
the
comparison
that
this
case
is
just
like
farmer,
it
is
radically
different.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
would
like
to
add
one
further
comment
to
the
question
you
raised
before,
by
pointing
out
it
in
a
sense
section
8(b)(2)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
likewise
imposes
a
fiduciary
duty
on
unions
vis-à-vis
it's
members
and
yet
the
same
universally
accepted
rule
under
the
nlra
that
punitive
damages
are
not
available
would
obtain
and
we
go
from
there
to
the
fact
that
under
303
as
held
in
morton
and
under
301
as
held
in
howard
johnson,
the
remedial
principles
at
the
nlra
extend
to
the
lmra
as
well.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
hope
we
can
take
it
as
given
that
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
such
the
1935
act,
that
only
remedial
relief
is
available.
in
1947,
congress
amended
that
act
through
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
it
provided
some
new
--
first
of
all
it
provided
new
set
of
union
unfair
labor
practices
including
8(b)(2)
that
they
may
not
ask
for
the
discrimination
of
employee
against
employees
on
the
basis
of
membership.
and
it
also
added
the
303
statutory
toward,
where
does
been
a
breach
of
a,
or
there
has
been
a
secondary
boycott
or
jurisdictional
strike
the
employer
has
that
additional
remedy,
but
under
teamsters
versus
morton
only
a
remedial
relief
is
available
and
also
an
independent
breach
of
contract
action
and
that
is
301.
the
only
other
point
i
would
make
is
we
think
it
is
incongruent
to
suggest
that
a
plaintiff
in
such
a
case
--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
we
think
so.
there
have
been
one
or
two
district
courts
which
at
the
motion
stage
have
said
we
won't
rule
it
out.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
again
it
could
be
against
the
either.
brooke's
shoe
interesting
enough
was
union
suit
against
an
employer,
but
it
works
the
other
way
as
well.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i'm
not
aware
of
any
actual
award
of
punitive
damages
in
any
301
case.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
it
has
--
well
it's
been
expressly
rejected
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
brooke
shoe
decision
that
we
cite.
two
district
courts
at
the
motions
stage
have
said
we
are
not
prepared
to
say
they
can
never
be
awarded,
but
there
was
no
decision
on
the
merits
of
that
question.
our
final
point
is
that
we
think
it
would
be
incongruence
to
allow
a
plaintiff
in
these
cases
to
recover
more
from
his
union
in
this
situation
that
if
the
union
had
filed
the
grievance
and
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
against
the
employer
itself.
thank
you.
