mr.
terry
w.
mackey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
beginning
point
of
the
argument
was
vaca
versus
sipes
statement.
we
hold
that
such
damages
are
not
recoverable
from
the
union
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
that
case
in
the
next
paragraph
goes
on
to
say,
“the
appropriate
remedy
for
a
breach
of
a
union's
duty
of
fair
representation
must
vary
with
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
breach.”
we
rely
in
our
brief
on
textile
workers
versus
lincoln
mills,
a
case
decided
in
1957
and
in
that
case,
they
went
into
the
statutory
history
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
admittedly
those
–
the
acts
here
–-
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
lmra
are
very
similar
in
their
approaches
to
the
solving
of
union
problems,
but
lincoln
mills
like
vaca
leaves
it
almost
to
an
ad
hoc
approach
to
each
case
for
the
district
courts.
there
is
no
guidance,
one
suspects
in
later
cases
unless
you
can
take
such
cases
as
harrison
versus
the
united
transportation
union,
a
case
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
in
1976
in
this
court,
in
which
it
was
stated
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
unless
punitive
damages
are
available,
an
employee
may
lack
the
strong
legal
remedy
necessary
to
protect
his
rights
against
a
union,
which
is
either
maliciously
or
in
utter
disregard
of
his
rights
denied
him
fair
representation,
to
say
then
that
this
court
when
it
denied
cert
did
not
have
that
issue
before
it
to
consider
as
one
that
i
cannot
say
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
i
can
say
it
was
certainly
an
issue
in
the
case
and
appears
to
have
been
decided
by
this
court
at
that
time.
it
would
seem
then
that
if
in
fact
it
is
an
ad
hoc
approach
that
we
must
take,
you
must
examine
in
each
case
to
“vaca”
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
the
union
has
always
glossed
over
the
real
relationship
between
mr.
foust
and
the
defendant
in
the
court
below.
the
problems
between
mr.
foust
as
the
record
reflects
in
each
and
every
instance
is
that
in
april
of
1970
mr.
foust
contacted
mr.
jones
whose
deposition
was
referred
to
in
prior
argument.
mr.
foust
received
no
response
to
that
and
indeed
subsequently
contacted
mr.
jones
again
in
november,
through
his
counsel
mr.
moriadi
(ph)
who
was
then
representing
him
in
the
matter
of
his
personal
injury
fela
(ph)
case
with
the
railroad
asking
why
some
action
had
not
been
taken
on
the
1970
written
letter,
which
is
in
the
record
to
mr.
jones,
no
action
had
occurred
on
that.
on
september
8,
meanwhile,
the
union
was
conferring
among
itself.
mr.
wisniski,
the
other
defendant
and
mr.
jones
in
fact
were
writing
letters
to
each
other
about
what
to
do
about
mr.
foust.
neither
of
them
contacted
mr.
foust
until
december
8,
however
and
then
mr.
jones
and
mr.
foust
had
a
telephone
conversation
in
which
mr.
foust
alleged
that
mr.
jones
told
him
that
the
union
would
do
nothing
for
mr.
foust,
because
he
had
retained
counsel
in
his
fela
case
and
therefore
he
could
take
his
counsel
and
do
as
he
would
with
his
contract
relationship
with
the
railroad.
that
is
a
disputed
fact
before
the
court,
but
taking
the
rule,
the
evidence
most
favorable
to
the
prevailing
party
that
seems
to
be
an
appropriate
fact.
the
next
item
is
that
the
railroad
than
became
involved
with
mr.
foust
and
there
were
two
pieces
of
correspondence
resulting
in
the
february
3
letter
discharging
mr.
foust.
that
letter
purportedly
by
the
union
to
be
only
a
relationship
only
dealing
with
a
relationship
between
mr.
foust
and
the
railroad
was
the
termination
letter
with
copies
sent
to
mr.
wisniski,
the
other
defendant
in
the
case.
consequently,
mr.
wisniski,
and
the
record
reflects
this
there
upon
two
days
later,
mr.
foust
was
discharged
on
february
3
and
two
days
later
on
february
5,
mr.
wisniski
again
wrote
to
mr.
jones
saying,
please
send
me
all
that
you
have
on
this
matter.
promptly
thereafter
mr.
jones
responded
to
mr.
wisniski
by
sending
him
a
copy
of
a
leave
of
absence
form
and
that
was
all
that
he
had
in
his
records,
mr.
jones
had
in
his
records
relating
to
that.
again
the
union
had
no
correspondence
with
mr.
foust
directly.
subsequently
mr.
moriadi
(ph)
thereafter,
the
attorney
for
mr.
foust,
in
an
attempt
believing
that
the
discharge
was
so
patently
wrongful
on
its
face
it
could
simply
be
resolved
by
confrontation
with
the
railroad,
wrote
to
the
officer
who
had
signed
the
discharge
letter.
he
received
no
response;
again
these
matters
are
in
the
record.
he
received
no
response;
he
called
that
same
officer.
that
officer
said,
well
this
is
a
matter
for
the
union
to
take
up.
mr.
moriadi
(ph)
then
on
march
26
and
that
letter
is
set
out
in
a
footnote
in
the
opinion
of
the
tenth
circuit,
but
mr.
moriadi
(ph)
then
wrote
to
mr.
jones
of
the
union
that
was
either
the
51
or
52
day,
the
record
says
51,
there
is
argument
that
it
may
have
been
the
52
day,
but
in
any
event,
we
know
that
that
letter
was
received,
it
was
mailed
on
the
26,
march
and
that
was
the
taking
with
the
date
most
favorable
to
the
union
even
the
52
day
and
received
in
rawlins
where
mr.
jones
was
on
the
27,
the
53
day.
mr.
jones
promptly
called
mr.
wisniski,
the
other
defendant,
and
he
said
now
what
do
i
do?
and
mr.
wisniski
promptly
wrote
the
letter
set
forth
of
the
5,
april,
one
day
too
late
saying,
he
typed
that
letter
and
he
sent
it
to
mr.
jones
and
he
said
to
mr.
jones
now
you
mail
that
to
mr.
foust
saying
we
are
not
going
to
recognize
his
request
for
us
to
handle
his
grievance.
the
simple
fact
was
that
was
done
on
march
30.
the
first
correspondence
relating
to
mr.
foust
grievance
was
march
30,
the
55
day,
plenty
of
time
in
which
to
obtain
the
necessary
form,
which
was
a
very
simple
letter
saying,
there
is
a
letter
addressed
to
mr.
h.m.
robertson.
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
and
it
says,
we
have
a
grievance
on
behalf
of
mr.
foust
that
he
was
wrongfully
discharged;
we
will
send
you
the
details
and
so,
that
was
a
simple
proposition.
all
of
this
took
place
again
between
mr.
wisniski
and
mr.
jones
of
the
union
without
contact
to
mr.
foust.
then
again
referring
to
the
relationship
between
mr.
foust
and
the
union,
at
that
point,
the
letter
of
the
5
from
mr.
wisniski
to
mr.
jones
says
you
better
send
this
letter,
the
one
saying
we
are
not
going
to
represent
you
to
mr.
foust,
so
we
don't
get
any
litigation.
then
promptly,
thereafter
mr.
jones
sends
the
notice
of
grievance
to
the
railroad
and
shortly
thereafter,
on
the
9,
april
sends
an
explanatory
letter
to
mr.
foust,
the
first
writing
of
explanation
by
the
union
from
april
17,
1972
to
april
9,
1971
by
the
union
to
mr.
foust.
that's
the
relationship
that
existed.
in
fact,
the
letter
of
grievance
--
i
refer
to
it
as
letter
of
grievance,
the
letter
to
the
carrier,
the
railroad
is
in
the
record
twice.
it
bears
two
hand
written
dates,
each
written
by
mr.
jones
both
of
them
unfortunately
late,
but
one
of
them
later
than
the
other.
the
ultimate
decision
was
that
the
letter
of
the
6,
the
grievance
letter
of
the
6
was
the
appropriate
one.
there
is
another
identical
letter
in
the
record
with
a
hand
written
date
that
shows
it
was
mailed
on
the
8.
the
inferences
that
maybe
drawn
from
that
are
that
the
relationship
between
mr.
foust
and
the
union
was
not
quite
as
simple,
as
the
union
might
wanted
it
to
be
or
might
conclude
it
to
be
on
the
basis
of
those
facts.
there
had
been
prior
conduct
between
the
union
and
mr.
foust
that
would
indicate
according
to
the
trial
court's
instruction,
one
of
the
necessary
requirements
are
reckless,
wanton,
disregard
of
the
rights
of
mr.
foust
or
oppressive
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
union
as
defined
by
the
trial
court
and
trial
court's
--
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
from
the
union?
no
sir.
if
they
had
filed
in
time?
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
no
if
they
had
filed
in
time,
you
would
have
no
cause.
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
the
question
is
punitive
damages.
the
question
therefore
is
what
is
the
--
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
no
sir.
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
--
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
i
need
to
ask
you
sir,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
if
the
union
had
filed
in
time,
would
mr.
foust
have
a
cause
of
action?
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
if
the
union
had
filed
in
time
mr.
foust
would
have
no
course
of
action.
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
no
sir.
the
question
of
–-
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
no
sir,
it
was
not.
in
fact
the
instructions
--
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
the
instructions
were
to
the
contrary
at
the
request
to
the
union.
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
i
feel
that
mr.
foust
should
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
determination
of
the
wrongfulness
of
his
discharge.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
though
and
there
is
an
exhibit
dealing
with
that
in
the
record.
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
the
damages
would
have
been
minimum
as
is
suggested
by
counsel.
and
the
defendant's
exhibit
y,
which
is
the
report
of
the
second
division
of
the
railroad
board
of
adjustment,
which
although
not
a
complete
determination
on
the
merit
says,
it
starts
out
by
saying
first
of
all
this
grievance
was
filed
untimely.
but
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
the
justice
in
this
decision
because
of
the
merits,
and
so
it
would
seem
to
indicate
that
was
the
railroad's
–
the
union's
exhibit,
it
would
seem
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
meritorious
claim
here,
although
there
was
no
determination
of
that
and
that's
the
only
exhibit
in
the
record
that
was
referred
to
that.
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
no
sir.
the
--
i
cannot
accept
the
premise
that
a
union
would
never
be
entitled
to
have
punitive
damages
assessed
against
it.
i've
misstated
that.
i
mean
to
say
that
i
cannot
accept
the
premise
that
an
union
somehow
is
isolated
and
may
conduct
itself
in
a
vacuum
without
fear
of
retribution
in
the
appropriate
case
and
that's
all
punitive
damages
are.
it's
a
retributive
attempt
by
civil
plaintiff
to
deter
a
defendant
from
a
subsequent
conduct
of
the
same
kind.
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
action,
question
here
to
indicate
that
such
an
approach
is
possible.
and
indeed,
in
textile
workers
versus
lincoln
mills
at
page
195,
i
believe
it
is,
no,
excuse
me!
at
page
455,
they
were
discussing
--
the
court
there
is
discussing
the
legislative
history
and
mr.
warden
of
congress
made
the
statement,
“mr.
chairman,
i
take
this
time
for
the
purpose
of
asking
the
chairman
a
question,
and,
in
asking
the
question
i
want
it
understood
that
it
is
intended
to
make
a
part
of
the
record
that
may
hereafter
be
referred
to
as
history
of
the
legislation.
it
is
my
understanding
that
section
302,
the
section
dealing
with
equal
responsibility
under
collective
bargaining
contracts
in
strike
actions
and
proceedings
in
district
courts,
contemplates
not
only
the
ordinary
lawsuits
for
damages,
but
also
such
other
remedial
proceedings
both
legal
and
equitable
as
might
be
appropriate
in
the
circumstances.
in
other
words,
proceedings
could
for
example,
be
brought
by
the
employers,
the
labor
organizations
or
interested
individual
employees
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
in
order
to
secure
declarations
from
the
court
of
legal
rights
under
the
contract.”
mr.
hartley:
the
interpretation
the
gentleman
has
just
given
of
that
section
is
absolutely
correct.”
so
the
legislative
history
would
indicate
that
in
relationships
between
the
employee
and
his
union,
nothing
was
to
be
changed.
all
of
the
rights
and
remedies
granted
under
the
common
law
of
this
country
would
remain
available
and
indeed
other
statutory
remedies
such
as
the
uniform
declaratory
judgment
act
in
state
court
or
as
the
federal
statutes
have
adopted
it,
would
be
available.
so
that
would
seem
to
belie
the
position
that
at
any
time
congress
ever
attempted
to
immunize
labor
unions
from
the
kinds
of
damages
necessary
to
deter
conduct
under
appropriate
cases.
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
our
claim
because
of
the
way
it
was
phrased
is
what
is
referred
to
as
a
statutory
tort
under
the
federal
labor
act
itself.
now,
this
court
has
decided
in
previous
cases
that
had
it
come
up
under
a
state
cause
of
action
and
i
guess
now
you
are
beginning
to
pick
names.
how
are
you
going
to
characterize
this?
for
instance
--
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
no.
i'm
suggesting
that
and
the
purpose
of
that
last
quote
was
to
suggest
that
in
drafting
the
legislation
referred
to
and
relied
upon
by
appellant
in
this
case,
they
have
misconstrued
the
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history
did
not
intend
to
remove
those
civil
remedies
that
would
have
existed
had
the
act
never
been
adopted
and
perhaps
i'm
not
making
myself
clear
on
that,
but
--
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
there
would
have
been
no
statutory
tort,
which
brings
me
to
the
next
point
that
is
again
now
picking
names.
there
are
almost
identical
cases
involving
state
courts
arising
in
state
courts
and
by
the
way
vaca
versus
sipes
arose
in
a
state
court
action,
but
the
laburnum
case
and
the
russell
case
citied
in
our
briefs
and
most
recently
farmer
versus
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters,
a
case
decided
in
this
court
in
1977
where
the
cause
of
action
almost
identical
to
the
one,
which
mr.
foust
has,
was
characterized
as
an
outrageous
conduct
case,
a
state
tort
of
outrageous
conduct.
now
had
mr.
foust
perhaps
chosen
to
characterize
those
same
set
of
facts
set
forth
in
his
complaint
as
an
outrageous
conduct
kind
of
case,
then
perhaps
we
would
be
here
under
different
set
of
facts
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
would
be
in
a
wyoming
state
law
remedies.
and
under
wyoming
state
law
remedies,
punitive
damages
would
be
available
under
those
circumstances,
but
here
we
are
talking
about
characterizing
it.
it's
the
same
set
of
facts,
whether
you
call
it
outrageous
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
union
or
whether
you
call
it
a
statutory
tort.
i
mean
the
statute
does
not
say
that
if
the
labor
union
fails
to
represent
mr.
foust
then
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
these
cases
have
all
come
up
beginning
with
elgin
and
joliet
cited
by
counsel
for
the
appellant
on
the
basis
of
an
implied
duty
of
fair
representation,
not
written
into
the
statute
at
all,
but
indeed
arising
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
congress
took
away
from
mr.
foust
his
right
to
bargain
with
his
employer
and
gave
that
right
to
the
union.
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
he
would
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
facts
of
this
case
similar
to
that
-–
mr.
terry
w.
mackey
oh,
no.
the
right
here
is
one
that
this
court
has
created
and
consequently,
this
court
has
left
us
in
the
position
of
adopting
those
cases
like
vaca
versus
sipes
in
trying
to
sort
it
out
and
again
we
come
back
to
what
appears
to
be
almost
ad
hoc
an
approach
for
the
district
courts
and
the
problem
that
i
have
in
that
is
that
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
what
the
subsequent
cases
would
take
us
to
although
that
is
what
the
brief
of
appellant
begins
to
lead
us
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
if
you
adopt
the
position
of
laburnum
construction
corporate,
the
united
construction
versus
laburnum
and
the
russell
case,
international
union
united
automobile
workers
versus
russell
where
punitive
damages
were
totally
allowed
by
the
court.
the
same
is
true
in
carpenters
and
again
we
find
the
language
and
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
the
punitive
damages
in
harrison
versus
the
utu.
harrison
versus
the
utu
is
in
fact
a
duty
of
fair
representation
case
as
they
are
characterized
that
of
the
implied
right
created
by
statute
also
known
as
the
statutory
tort.
and
so,
consequently
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
plenty
of
authority
and
that
the
real
question
is
not
whether
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
went
far
enough,
it
relied
upon
the
kinds
of
cases
that
are
set
forth
in
the
brief,
but
whether
or
not
the
district
court
in
giving
the
instruction
that
it
gave
on
the
question
of
punitive
damages
was
acting
lawfully
and
in
accordance
with
the
laws
it
was
then
constituted
based
upon
the
cases
we
have
cited.
the
record
i
believe
justifies
an
award
of
punitive
damages
in
this
case.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
reason
to
believe
based
upon
the
cases
that
go
before
that
labor
unions
were
ever
immunized
to
the
extent
that
they
might
conduct
themselves
in
anyway
they
see
fit
without
fear
of
the
usual
remedies
available
and
consequently
we
feel
that
the
case
was
tried
appropriately
in
the
tenth
circuit
court
opinion
is
appropriate
and
correct
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm.
