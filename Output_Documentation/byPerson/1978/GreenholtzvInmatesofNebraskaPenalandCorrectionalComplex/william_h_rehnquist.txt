justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gillan
this
case
itself
didn’t
come
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
ever
interpreted
this
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
does
that
mean
really
that
there
are
three
different
positions
taken
here
that
the
state
takes
a
position
there
is
a
neither
a
liberty
or
property
interest
involved,
the
government
says
there
is
a
--
the
federal
government
says
there
is
a
property
interest
because
of
the
statute
and
your
opponent
say
there
is
a
liberty
interest
because
of
the
freedom
that
would
resolve
from
the
granting
of
parole.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
morrissey
turned
on
in
the
presence
of
a
liberty
interest
or
the
presence
of
the
property
interest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
feel
that
parole
provisions
of
nebraska
here
are
different
than
the
morrissey
type
provisions
that
you
were
just
describing
as
refereed
from
the
chief
justice
as
it
had
been,
because
i
take
the
government’s
position
is
a
property
interest
of
the.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
here
in
the
state
laws.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
of
supreme
court
of
nebraska
next
month
were
to
say
that
the
federal
governments
constructed
its
parole
statute
were
wrong
and
that
it’s
a
purely
discretionary
thing.
the
government’s
argument
would
be
somewhat
different
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
flatter
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
ridenour
would
you
suggest
that
litigants
are
entitled
to
be
present
at
our
conference
following
the
open
sessions
of
the
court
because
that’s
where
we
really
decide
the
case
even
though
they
had
an
opportunity
to
have
their
counsel
argue
at
an
open
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
does
have
an
opportunity
to
appear
before
the
parole
board,
doesn’t
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
we
are
prohibited
by
the
constitution
from
limiting
arguments
to
say
30
minutes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ridenour
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
stipulation
of
facts
that
appears
in
page
30,
and
31
of
the
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
paragraph
one
says
discretionary
parole
is
used
by
the
nebraska
board
of
parole
as
the
release
on
parole
by
virtue
of
an
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
board
of
parole.
is
that
something
different
than
what
we
are
talking
about
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
in
the
stipulation
that
there
is
a
release
on
parole
by
virtue
of
an
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
board
of
parole?
