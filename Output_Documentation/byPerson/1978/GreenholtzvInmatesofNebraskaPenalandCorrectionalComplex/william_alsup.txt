mr.
william
alsup
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
decisions
and
the
court
sends
the
roth
case
at
least
in
many
instances
that’s
including
the
morrissey
case
have
required
a
statement
of
reasons
as
part
of
the
bundle
of
rights
that
the
court
has
prescribed
for
given
circumstance
and
our
reference
in
the
brief
an
acknowledgment
of
the
fact
that
on
occasion
the
court
has
required
a
statement
of
reason.
mr.
william
alsup
no
your
honor,
they’re
different
circumstances.
mr.
william
alsup
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
alsup
morrissey
turned
upon
an
entitlement
to
liberty
that
was
created
by
the
implicit
promise
as
the
chief
justice
recognized
in
the
opinion
for
the
court
that
that
conditional
liberty
would
not
be
revoked
unless
certain
specified
conditions
were
met.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
the
government
recognizes
that
the
entitlement
of
property
cases
are
analogous
to
the
entitlement
of
liberty
cases
just
in
fact
that
very
analogy
was
used
by
the
court
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell
that
there
could
be
a
statutorily
created
right
to
liberty
just
as
there
could
be
a
statutorily
created
right
to
property.
i
should
--
if
there’s
any
confusion
on
the.
mr.
william
alsup
that’s
correct
or
in
a
federal
statute.
mr.
william
alsup
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
alsup
if
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
were
to
give
an
authoritative
ruling
saying
that
this
statute
does
not
mean
what
it
appears
to
mean,
and
it’s
a
purely
discretionary
parole
preceding
with
no
right
or
entitlement
to
release
upon
certain
conditions
then
we
would
take
the
position
that
there
would
be
no
due
process
hearing
required.
so
i
think
the
answer
is
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
yes,
if
they
were
to
change
the
law
then
–
mr.
william
alsup
let
me
respond
mr.
chief
justice
stevens
in
two
respects.
first,
there
might
be
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
problem
with
such
a
form
of
punishment
that
allowed
an
individual
to
go
back
into
his
community
to
reestablish
roots
with
his
family
and
then
for
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
reasons
to
be
ripped
out
of
that
environment.
whether
or
not
that
would
be
unconstitutional
on
that
ground
i
can’t
say
but
certainly
such
an
issue
would
arise
–
mr.
william
alsup
again
not
to
fight
the
hypothetical
too
much
i
think
this
court.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
i
think
we
would
have
to
say
if
in
fact
it
were
purely
discretionary
right
to
revoke
then
the
particular
person
out
on
parole
would
have
no
legitimate
expectation
of
continuing
with
his
liberty.
i
have
to
say
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
alsup
let’s
say,
if
i
understand
the
circumstances.
we
have
a
parolee
who
has
been
released
subject
to
the
normal
conditions
and
in
addition
there’s
a
statute
which
allows
the
board
to
revoke
parole
out
of
whim.
mr.
william
alsup
there
might
be
a
problem
with
such
a
statute
under
the
division
that
was
apparent
in
the
court
in
the
arnett
case
in
which
some
of
the
justices
took
the
position
that
a
substantive
right
could
be
prescribed
by
the
state
legislature
but
the
procedure
for
revoking
it
could
not
be
and
i
believe
six
justices
rejected
the
position
that
such
arbitrary
procedures
could
be
huge.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
that
of
course
is
not
the
case
is
presented
here.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
i
would,
i’d
say
subject
to
the
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
we
do
not
have
a
position
and
i
can
only
say
that
there
would
be
arnett
versus
kennedy
problem.
mr.
william
alsup
in
such
cases
that
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
the
government’s
position
would
be
clear
most
of
these
worked
furlough
programs
are
for
short
durations
up
to
30
days,
and
it
is
in
absolute
condition
of
any
of
those
work
study
or
work
release
programs
that
the
warden
or
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
a
absolute
authority
to
terminate
the
program
or
the
liberty
at
anytime.
under
those
circumstances
under
a
statute
or
in
regulation
which
conferred
no
entitlement
to
work
release
or
furlough,
we
would
say
there
will
be
no
right
to
a
due
process
hearing
at
all.
because
there
has
been
some
questions
raised
about
the
federal
parole
system
or
perhaps
i
could
take
just
a
moment
to
draw
the
court’s
attention
to
two
features
of
the
federal
parole
statute
which
at
least
for
purposes
of
the
issue
that’s
presented
here
distinguish
the
federal
parole
system.
unlike
the
nebraska
statute
which
creates
a
presumption
that
the
prisoner
will
be
released
at
the
first
moment
of
eligibility
or
shortly
thereafter,
the
united
states
parole
commission
statute
establishes
utmost
a
presumption
that
the
prisoner
will
be
released
at
sometime
during
the
guidelines
established
by
the
united
states
parole
commission.
the
commission
is
absolutely
free
in
its
discretion
to
select
a
date
within
that
guideline
range,
although
if
the
commission
selects
a
date
outside
the
guideline
range,
the
commission
must
have
good
cause
to
do
so.
because
the
commission
has
absolute
discretion
to
select
a
date
within
the
guideline
range
under
the
position
that
we
have
taken
no
due
process
hearing
and
all
would
be
required
so
long
as
the
release
date
is
selected
does
fall
within
that
guideline
period.
now
that’s
under
the
statute
itself.
i
should
hasten
to
say
as
a
second
distinguishing
feature
that
by
regulation,
the
united
states
parole
commission
has
adopted
a
procedure
of
setting
a
presumptive
release
date
which,
very
soon
after
the
prisoner
arrives
at
the
federal
institution
which
tells
the
prisoner
that
on,
for
example,
march
3rd
1981,
the
prisoner
will
be
released
so
long
as
a,
there’s
good
behavior
be
a
satisfactory
release
plan
has
established
and
finally
there’s
no
subsequent
new
information
that
comes
to
light
which
shows
that
the
original
plan
was
a
mistake
in
the
first
place
or
the
original
date
was
a
mistake.
now,
in
fact
just
by
regulations
issued
yesterday
by
the
parole
commission
this
presumptive
release
date
practice
is
now
been
extended
–-
mr.
william
alsup
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
alsup
this
federal
procedure
of
a
presumptive
release
date
has
now
been
extended
by
regulation
issued
yesterday
to
virtually
all
federal
prisoners.
the
significance
of
that
is
that
under
the
position
of
the
united
states,
once
a
presumptive
release
date
is
set
subject
to
those
conditions
it
cannot
be
changed
or
altered
without
some
sort
of
the
due
process
hearing.
with
respect
to
the
merits,
it
is
our
position
that
denial
of
parole
requires
a
due
process
hearing
only
where
the
statute
or
regulations
or
some
mutual
expectation
as
the
court
said
in
the
leis
versus
flynt
case
last
monday,
exist
to
create
an
entitlement
to
release.
we
think
this
follows
from
two
propositions.
first,
the
denial
of
parole
itself
does
not
result
in
a
deprivation
of
liberty,
the
deprivation
of
liberty
occurs
upon
conviction.
the
denial
of
parole
continues
the
incarceration
under
that
lawfully
imposed
sentence.
now,
if
the
court
accepts
that
argument
then
the
remainder
of
the
argument
seems
to
be
dictated
by
this
court’s
decisions
since
roth
in
which
the
question
has
been
very
clearly
posed
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
to
state
or
federal
statute
or
some
custom
has
created
an
entitlement
under
given
circumstances.
here
the
nebraska
statute
does
create
an
entitlement
to
release
so
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
upon
subject
to
defeasance
upon
any
of
four
conditions
and
we
believe
that
does
fall
within
this
court’s
definition
of
what
an
entitlement.
mr.
william
alsup
i’m
not
sure
what
states
the
--
mr.
william
alsup
well,
i
can
only
say
that
they’re
responsible
when
they
take
cases
from
the
district
court
of
nebraska
and
in
the
past,
this
court
has
been
willing
to
defer
to
a
court
of
appeals
understanding
on
state
law
involved.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
quite
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
alsup
well,
whether
or
not
there
should
be
deference
in
this
case
it
does
appear
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
does
provide
a
presumption
of
release
subject
to
defeasance
for
one
of
any
four
conditions.
mr.
william
alsup
no,
an
entitlement
either
to
liberty
or
to
property.
mr.
william
alsup
it
looks
more
like
liberty
than
property
but
because
it
an
entitlement
and
because
both
liberty
and
property
are
used
together
in
the
due
process
clause,
we
would
think
that
the
analysis
which
respect
to
each
would
be
the
same
whether
or
not
there
is
some
entitlement
either
to
liberty
or
to
property.
with
respect
to
what
processes
do
there
is
normally
the
due
process
cases
in
this
court
have
address
the
full
panoply
of
rights
or
components
on
the
hearing.
in
this
particular
case
the
petition
only
raise
two
issues.
one
of
those
issues
was
when
should
the
hearing
be
held
not
about
the
components
should
be
and
other
issue
is
whether
or
not
a
summary
of
the
evidence
of
fact
should
be
required.
in
my
remaining
time
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
just
the
first
of
those.
it
is
a
very
important
question
that
differentiates
parole
releases
from
parole
revocation
and
at
one
with
the
question
of
when
the
hearing
itself
should
be
held.
unlike
the
case
in
morrissey
where
the
revocation
hearing
had
to
come
in
the
wake
of
the
alleged
violation,
here
we
have
a
sensitive
process
of
monitoring
the
progress
of
an
inmate
and
the
very
question
itself
was
determining
when
is
most
propitious
movement
to
hold
the
hearing
is
itself
a
delicate
question
subject
to
the
expertise
in
the
parole
board.
and
for
that
reason
we
would
suggest
that
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
error
in
mandating
that
that
hearing
be
held
at
the
first
movement
of
eligibility
rather
than
perhaps
at
a
movement
when
the
hearing
might
really
do
the
inmate
or
good.
