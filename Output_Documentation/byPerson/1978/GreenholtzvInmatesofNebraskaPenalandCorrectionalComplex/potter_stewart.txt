the
government
as
you
know,
the
united
states
of
america
is
amicus
here,
construes
the
nebraska
statutory
provisions
as
being
quite
different
from
the
mine
runners
of
statutory
provisions
governing
parole
in
most
states.
if
you,
do
i
understand
that
you
disagree
with
their
construction
of
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
think
the
solicitor
general
has
misconstrued
your
act
or
misconstrued
the
federal
act?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don’t
believe
your
act
confers
an
entitlement
to
release
in
the
absence
of
specific
findings?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that’s
why
he
does
construe
it
as
i
understand
his
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
set
of
fact
findings
these
are
subjective
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
we
submit
today
a
fair
determination
of
facts
decisive
of
rights
is
the
basic
purpose
of
procedure
or
due
process.
the
reason
for
having
a
hearing
is
to
determine
facts
and
unless
there
are
some
facts
which
are
capable
of
being
determined
which
are
decisive
with
rights,
we
see
no
purpose
in
having
a
due
process
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gillan,
doesn’t
the
nebraska
statute
first
provide
that
after
a
certain
period
of
time
the
inmate
is
eligible
for
parole.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn’t
it
secondly
provide
that
one
who
has
reached
that
point
in
time
shall
be
released
parole
unless
there
is
certain
adverse
findings
made.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
doesn’t
the
decision
on
whether
those
adverse
conditions
exist
or
not
determine
whether
or
not
he
will
be
in
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that’s
not
a
liberty
interest
whether
or
not
he
is
in
jail.
justice
potter
stewart
well
your
first
--
maybe
a
liberty
interest,
but
it
is
not
a
deprivation
of
liberty
because
he
is
already
in
jail.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
really
not
much
difference
from
saying,
your
point
as
it
drains
all
the
force,
the
normal
force
out
of
the
word
“shall”.
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
though,
it
said
that
parole
board
shall
order
his
release
unless
it
decides
that
it
would
be
a
bad
idea.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
this
person
convicted
of?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
he
allowable
maximum?
justice
potter
stewart
was
he,
well
so
much
of
this
depends
upon
the
original
sentence
in
which
theirs
is
a,
never
have
been
thought,
would
be
any
requirement
of
any
fact
finding
or
any
entitlement
on
the
part
of
the
convicted
defendant
to
short
sentence
or
a
medium
sentence
as
contrasted
with
an
allowable
longer
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
one-third
of
the
maximum
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
what
was
imposed
by
the
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
he
actually
imposed?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
you
say
that
there
wasn’t
a
single
nebraska
judge
on
the
court
of
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
–
no,
there
wasn’t
any.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
word
shall
or
may,
you
wouldn’t
have
any
case
at
all,
you
concede
that?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
in
being
fully
and
fairly
considered
for
parole?
justice
potter
stewart
are
they
compensated?
justice
potter
stewart
all
five
of
them?
