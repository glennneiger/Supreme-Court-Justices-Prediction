mr.
gillan,
suppose
the
state
statute
provided
that
the
parole
board
could
act
on
the
basis
of
a
hunch,
say
the
language
was
very,
very
broad
and
said
that
because
these
things
are
largely
discretionary
they
can
act
on
the
basis
of
their
personal
experience
with
respect
to
certain
kinds
of
people
and
if
they
just
think
that
there
is
some
risk
that
the
man
may
not
be
behaving
properly,
they
have
a
statutory
right
to
do
it,
would
that
statute
be
on
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
its
not
then
there
really
is
no
fundamental
distinction
between
granting
and
denying.
if
you
rely
on
the,
is
the
status,
the
language
of
the
statute
make
any
difference.
it
seems
to
me
you
had
another
government
plays
--
argues
heavily
on
that
basis
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
first
of
all,
will
you
straighten
me
on
one
detail,
is
an
inmate
in
nebraska
permitted
to
inspect
the
file
prior
to
approval
of
review
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
there
is
something
incorrect
or
adverse
in
that
file,
he
doesn’t
have
whack
out
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gillan,
you
were
just
reading
the
statutes
supposing
there
are
four
reasons
why
parole
release
may
be
denied.
one
that
he
may
be
is,
we
will
not
confirm
the
conditions
of
parole
and
then
they
list
the
other
three.
now
assume
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
members
of
the
parole
board
get
together
and
they
all
agree
that
there
is
a,
no
substantial
risk,
b,
the
letting
him
out
after
ten
years
in
jail
it
wouldn’t
create
disrespect
for
the
law
and
c,
they
say
each
of
these
four
conditions
is
met
and
they’ve
put
that
down
in
writing
and
say
so.
don’t
they
have
a
statutory
duty
to
release
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
there
is
a
duty
in
some
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
one
further
question,
if
they
made
those
findings
would
he
have
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
be
released
even
though
his
liberty
was
then
being
deprived?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
would
it
be
because
as
the
federal
constitution
would
then
entitle
them
to
their
liberty.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
but
they
also
have
federal
right
to
release.
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
it
is,
you’re
talking
about
something
rooted
in
the
state
law.
