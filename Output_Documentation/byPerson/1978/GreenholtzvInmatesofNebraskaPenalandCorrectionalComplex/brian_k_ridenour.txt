mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
crucial
and
overriding
question
presented
by
this
case
is
a
fundamental
fairness
of
parole
release
proceedings
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
would
start
first
from
the
proposition
your
honor,
that
in
sentencing
the
process
if
there’s
typically
not
been
a
requirement
for
a
statement
of
reasons
for
the
sentencing
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
yeah
of
course
in
the
concept
--
in
the
process
of
the
criminal
proceeding
the
inmate
or
the
individual
has
been
accorded
a
great
deal
of
due
process,
the
facts
upon
which
a
judge
will
base
his
assertion.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
correct
your
honor,
but
the
judge
is
acquainted
with
the
facts
that
came
through
that
process
and
that’s
the
facts
that
will
influence
his
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
grant
probation,
as
to
whether
or
not
what
sentence
is
going
to
be
complied.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
it
creates
a
reasonable
expectation
in
my
line
that
the
judge
might
grant
probation
and
to
the
--
the
due
process
has
been
accorded
throughout
the
criminal
proceeding
accords
the
inmate
or
the
individual
what
he
is
entitled
to.
as
to
your
question
on
reasons
i
think
there
is
a
fundamental
distinction
between
sentencing
and
the
parole
system.
in
sentencing
if
you
deny
--
if
you
indicate
that
you
are
not
going
to
grant
probation,
there
is
no
function
served
as
such
by
the
reasons.
it
does
not
advise
that
individual
of
anything
that
he
could
do
to
get
probation
in
the
future.
it’s
the
decision
made
at
that
point.
on
the
other
hand
in
the
parole
process
if
you
advise
the
inmate
of
the
reasons
for
his
denial
of
parole,
then
at
a
future
time
he
can
work
or
as
he
goes
along
he
can
work
on
those
items
and
attempt
to
convince
the
board
at
his
next
hearing
that
he
should
be
granted
parole.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
have
not
--
frankly
certainly
your
honor
the
factors
or
considerations
would
be
precisely
same
in
the
probation
versus
a
parole
concept.
i
would
agree
with
you
it
would
probably
help
the
inmate
though
to
know
something
about
what
he
should
be
doing
to
correct
his
personality
problems
whatever
they
maybe,
so
that
he
can
better
convince
the
parole
board
to
grant
him
parole,
but
that
might
be
several
years,
three,
four,
five
years
off
and
the
parole
board’s
attitudes
maybe
significantly
different
than
what
that
sense
in
judge’s
attitudes
maybe.
as
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
here,
a
liberty
interest
is
created
by
the
statutes
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
that
interest
is
routinely
deprived
by
the
practices
employed
by
the
nebraska
parole
board,
but
it’s
not
yet
been
pointed
out
to
the
court
with
any
specificity
if
the
stage
at
which
the
parole
release
decision
is
made
in
the
state
of
nebraska
and
the
lack
of
procedural
protections
which
are
there
afforded.
in
fact
the
parole
release
decision
is
seldom
made
at
the
final
parole
hearing
rather
it
is
made
in
the
state
of
nebraska
at
a
case
in
record
review,
a
proceeding
at
which
few
of
any
procedural
safeguards
are
employed.
in
these
reviews
the
inmate
is
not
entitled
to
present
evidence
either
documentary
or
live.
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
or
counsel
substitute.
he
is
not
entitled
to
see,
hear,
or
know
of
any
adverse
information
received
or
considered
by
the
board.
indeed
the
most
fundamental
of
the
procedural
protection
is
his
presence
of
that
hearing
is
in
practical
reality
denied.
the
board
of
parole
nebraska
conducts
these
review
hearings
on
two
days
out
of
each
month.
during
the
period
of
july
1,
1975
through
june
30,
1976
they
conducted
645
of
these
hearings
on
those
two
days
out
of
each
month.
at
average
it
is
out
to
about
seven
minutes
per
hearing
at
which
the
board’s
principal
function
is
ask
the
inmates
a
few
questions
and
then
excuse
him
from
the
room
while
they
make
their
determination.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
no
your
honor
i’m
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
i’m
suggesting
that
an
inmate
is
entitled
at
least
to
an
appearance
before
that
board
at
which
he
has
a
realistic
opportunity
to
make
his
case
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
known
to
the
parole
board
as
to
why
he
should
be
granted
parole,
i’m
saying
nebraska
in
effect
denies
that
right.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
for
five
minutes
at
a
review
hearing.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
think
there
is
a
requirement
--
no
i
don’t
think
that
you
are
prohibited
by
the
constitution
from
limiting
arguments
to
30
minutes.
i
don’t
think
you’re
required
to
give
me
an
argument
at
all
in
this
case
you
could,
you
could
submit
the
case
on
briefs.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
certainly,
but
you
are
not
affecting,
your
honor,
my
interest,
you
are
not
affecting
me
the
person
appearing
before
you,
statements
in
the
parole
context
and
the
risk
of
the
erroneous
decisions
inherent
in
the
types
of
records
of
parole
board
deals
with
and
the
type
of
discretionary
decisions
they
make,
that
inmate
must
have
or
his
counsel
or
someone
must
have
the
ability
to
examine
those
records
and
to
make
corrections
and
to
appear
before
that
board
and
make
his
case.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
think
the
very
listing
of
factors
your
honor
regardless
of
the
prefatory
language
in
the
statute
limits
in
some
effect
that
discretion.
it
channels
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
but
i
believe
in
the
contexts
that
we
are
dealing
with
your
honor
hearing
in
fact
will
do
good
because
there
are
objective
factors
required
to
be
considered
by
the
nebraska
statutes
associate
be
shall
consider
--
the
board
shall
consider
the
14
factors.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
that
they
considered
the
factors
and
that
the
factors
were
in
fact
correct.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
it
does
in
the
sense
it
gives
the
inmate
the
ability
to
know
whether
the
factors
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
due
process
requires
or
the
state
statutes
in
the
first
place
your
honor
requires
those
factors
to
be
considered,
many
of
those
factors
can
come
only
from
the
inmate
and
the
only
opportunity
he
would
have
is
either
through
a
written
submission--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
would
suggest
that
a
written
submission
your
honor
in
the
case
of
many
inmates
would
not
be
an
adequate
opportunity
for
that
inmate
to
make
his
case.
there
are
many
inmates
who
simply
cannot
express
themselves
in
writing,
cannot
bring
forth
factual
information
they
might
need
to.
they
need
the
opportunity
to
appear
before
that
board
to
have
a
meaningful
chance
to
talk
to
that
board
and
to
make
the
case
for
parole.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
do
your
honor.
let
me
clarify
i
think
in
that
respect
why
i
think
that
is
true.
in
nebraska
there
are
two
types
of
parole
proceedings,
the
review
hearing
and
the
final
hearings.
it’s
at
the
review
hearing
the
decision
is
typically
made.
they
decide
at
the
review
hearing
whether
the
inmate
should
be
set
for
a
final
hearing
in
the
case.
it’s
used
as
a
screening
device.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
in
nebraska
that
the
final
hearing
is
in
fact
simply
confirmation
of
the
prior
decision
of
the
board
at
the
review
hearing.
roughly,
well
in
a
six
month
period
375
inmates
at
nebraska
who
were
eligible
for
parole
were
denied
that
final
hearing
on
the
basis
of
the
review
hearing.
now
the
final
hearing
nebraska
statute
permit
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
shudder
at
the
thought
too
if
all
hearings
were
to
have
lawyers
at
it
and
if
it
was
of
very
adversarial
nature.
i
don’t
suggest
that
it
should
be
anything
but
in
formal;
i
think
that
the
inmate
should
have
the
opportunity
to
bring
in
the
witness
for
in
an
in
formal
discussion
if
he
has
witnesses
who
indeed
can
present
evidence
that
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
we
are
not
contending
here
that
he
has
a
right
to
an
attorney
in
this
type
of
proceedings.
nebraska
at
the
final
hearings
permits
the
inmate
if
he
can
afford
counsel
on
his
own
to
have
those
--
to
have
counsel
present.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
645.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
that’s
my
computation.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
it’s
not
my
understanding
your
honor
in
review
hearings
of
many
there
would
be
a
rare
exception
that
any
would
run
30
minutes.
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
board
of
parole
was
that
in
general
these
hearings
take
no
longer
than
10
minutes.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
no,
i
think
most
cases
arising
in
this
court
however
have
come
from
lower
courts
where
there
was
in
fact
a
great
deal
of
due
process
court
and
that’s
significantly
different
in
the
parole
situation.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
think
that
it
first
needs
to
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
no,
i
have
not
done
a
calculation
on
that
but
for
each
of
the
formal
hearings
that
we
would,
in
the
words
of
the
board
they
would
call
it
a
formal
hearing,
if
they
could
call
it
due
process
right
so
the
due
process
this
court
might
say
was
applicable.
they
would
have
one
less
review
hearing
that
they
would
have
to
conduct
because
the
review
hearing
now
serves
essentially
as
a
substitute.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
it
would
approximately
double
the
number
of
formal
hearings
that
were
likely
to
be
held
by
the
nebraskan
parole
board
during
the
year.
i
don’t
believe
that
that
adds
a
significant
burden
to
them
nor
that’s
a
burden
that
can
be
easily
handled.
they
have
five
members
currently;
all
five
members
sit
at
every
formal
hearing.
the
nebraska
statute
does
not
require
that,
it
requires
only
a
majority
of
the
board
members
to
sit
with
the
hearings.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
no,
this
court
should
not
tell
nebraska
that.
i
simply
say
that
because
this
court
is
under
its
own
cases
concerned
with
an
analysis
of
what
the
burden
is
to
the
state
of
the
additional
safeguards
that
it
might
employ.
i
am
saying
that
the
burdens
incurred
in
this
case
wouldn’t
be
burdens
that
could
be
handled
by
the
nebraska
board
of
parole
because
they
have
the
extra
members
that
they
could
utilize
and
because
it
would
result
in
a
like
reduction
in
the
number
of
review
hearings
that
would
be
held.
i
do
not
argue
that
there
is
not
some
increased
burden
to
the
state.
i
say
simply
that
the
interest
of
the
inmate
and
his
liberty
outweighs
that
burden.
the
discussion
we
have
been
having
of
course
assumes
the
applicability
of
the
due
process
clause
to
parole
release
proceedings.
that
analysis
requires
an
examination
of
the
nature
of
the
interest
at
stake.
the
analysis
must
begin
i
think
with
an
examination
of
nebraska’s
statutory
provisions.
the
statute
has
been
quoted
here
several
times.
i
think
it
bears
reading
again,
“whenever
the
board
of
parole
considers
a
release
of
committed
offender
who
was
eligible
for
release
on
parole,
it
shall
order
his
release
unless
it
is
of
the
opinion
that
his
release
should
be
deferred
because,”
it
lists
then
the
four
statutory
grounds
upon
which
parole
maybe
denied.
that
same
statute
lists
14
factors
that
must
be
considered
by
the
parole
board
in
its
decision.
the
statute
comes
from
the
model
penal
code,
is
an
exact
adoption
of
that,
of
the
provisions
of
the
model
penal
code.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
do
not
concede
that
at
all
your
honor.
i
say
that
the
simplest
and
easiest
grounds
that
this
court
can
find
for
my
clients
on
it
is
on
the
basis
of
that
statute.
i
think
there
is
larger
question
involved
in
this
case,
obviously
as
to
whether
an
inmate
has
a
constitutional
liberty
interest
in
parole,
separate
and
apart
from
the
nebraska
statute.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
at
least
in
that
respect,
whether
it
be
considered
the
right
to
parole
or
the
right
to
be
fully
considered,
it’s
the
same
result.
i
think
my
clients
they
have
a
right
to
the
due
process
of
that
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
agree
with
you
in
that
respect.
i
think
nebraska
statute
goes
almost
as
far
to
create
in
essence
a
statutory
entitlement
to
parole
not
to
--
it
also
creates
a
statutory
entitlement
to
consideration
for
parole,
but
if
it
goes
almost
as
far
as
seeing
statutory
entitlement
to
parole.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
no,
we
are
talking
about
discretionary
parole.
discretionary
parole
is
a
term
that
the
state
has
long
used
in
describing
the
process.
i
don’t
think
that
by
the
stipulation
we
mean
to
say
that
it’s
an
exercise
solely
of
discretion
or
that
discretion
is
unbridled
or
un-channeled
by
the
state
statutes
however.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
do
not
deny
that
there
are
large
elements
of
discretion
in
the
parole
release
proceeding,
but
i
suggest
that
nebraska
statutes
channel
and
instruct
the
parole
board
on
how
to
exercise
that
discretion.
and
under
those
circumstances
there
is
a
statutory
entitlement
to
a
fair
consideration
of
parole.
in
discussing
that
very
statute
the
national
advisory
commission
on
the
criminal
justice
standards
and
goals
stated
that
the
model
penal
code
represents
a
turnaround
in
the
traditional
assumption
that
the
burden
of
proof
however
evaluated
rests
on
the
inmate.
it
proposes
that
an
inmate
is
to
be
released
on
parole
when
he
is
first
eligible
unless
one
of
the
four
conditions
exists.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
statute
therefore
creates
a
presumption
in
favor
of
release
defeasible
only
if
one
of
the
limited
number
of
grounds
for
denial
is
found
to
be
present.
this
case
thus
unlike
is
meachum
versus
fano
where
there
was
no
such
statutory
entitlement.
it
rather
is
like
the
morrissey
case,
it
is
like
wolff
versus
mcdonnell
both
in
that
it
affects
the
term
of
confinement
of
the
inmate
rather
than
the
conditions
of
confinement
as
were
at
issue
in
meachum
and
because
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
you
are
asking
me,
do
i
think
he
has
been
denied
due
process?
i
certainly
do.
part
of
the
risk
in
the
nebraska
procedure
and
i
think
in
any
parole
board,
the
procedure
that
might
be
the
file
of
another
individual
and
at
least
by
that,
it
might
be
the
file
of
another
individual.
you
may
have
two
john
does
and
you
are
looking
at
the
wrong
john
doe
and
you
deny
the
hearing
to
the
individual
who
was
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
certainly
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
in
some
extreme
circumstances
we
are
going
to
know,
and
the
parole
board
is
going
to
know,
beforehand
that
a
hearing--
and
perhaps
the
inmate
will
know,
is
essentially
useless.
but
in
many
cases
i
think
it
will
be
very
useful
both
to
the
inmate
and
the
board.
and
if
the
court
can
instruct
us
on
how
to
draw
a
line
between
what
will
be
useful
and
what
won’t
in
that
standpoint,
i
think
you
know
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
our
concern,
but
absent
that
kind
of
a
line
i
think
that
all
of
those
hearings
are
going
to
have
to
be
conducted
for
the
benefit
of
the
many
over
those
--
over
the
extreme
examples.
the
board
has
argued
here
in
some
of
the
questions
of
concern
this
objective
of
discretionary
nature
of
the
decision.
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
this
court’s
cases
have
required
a
consideration
of
the
interest
at
stake,
not
the
nature
of
the
board’s
proceedings
in
determining
whether
due
process
applies.
release
proceedings
in
my
mind
are
two
step
process,
the
first
is
a
fact
gathering
process,
through
the
file,
through
the
social
history
of
the
inmate,
through
the
correctional
department
talking
to
the
employee,
the
people
he
may
be
employed
by,
it
gathers
many
objective
facts
that
the
parole
board
will
consider
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion;
that
discretion
being
the
second
step
in
the
parole
process.
but
it’s
significant
and
important
to
the
inmate
and
so
they
have
the
ability
to
ensure
that
the
facts
upon
which
that
predictive
expertise
of
the
parole
board
is
exercised
are
accurate
and
correct
in
order
to
prevent
the
occurrence
of
inaccurate
decisions
based
upon
inaccurate
facts.
briefly
i’d
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
as
well
the
notice
provisions
undertaken
by
the
state
of
nebraska
as
to
parole
proceedings.
in
the
state
of
nebraska
at
a
parole
release
review
hearing
or
at
a
final
hearing
if
the
inmate
is
either
deferred
or
denied
parole,
he
is
informed
of
the
month
during
which
he
will
next
appear
before
the
board.
he
is
not
advised
however
as
to
the
day
or
the
hour
at
which
that
hearing
will
occur,
that
information
is
supplied
to
the
inmate
only
on
the
day
of
the
actual
hearing
through
the
posting
of
a
list
at
the
penal
complex
of
the
inmates
who
will
be
heard
on
that
day.
in
notifying
the
inmates
of
the
reasons
for
denial
particularly
following
a
review
hearing
the
notice
takes
on
the
effect
of
being
almost
meaningless
to
the
inmate.
the
board
uses
a
pre-printed
form
called
a
pb-1
an
example
of
which
is
located
at
page
35
of
the
appendix.
while
the
board
continues
a
statuary
ground
or
the
form
contains
statuary
grounds
for
denial
of
parole,
the
board
simply
checks
it
off
without
explanation
of
what
the
specific
facts
upon
which
it
is
relying
are.
in
80%
of
the
cases
it
checks
item
a
which
reads,
your
continued
correctional
treatment,
vocational,
educational
or
job
assignment
in
the
facility
will
substantially
enhance
your
capacity
to
lead
a
law
abiding
life
when
you
are
released
at
a
later
date.
no
explanation
is
ever
given
on
this
form
to
the
inmate
as
to
which
of
the
alternatives
listed
in
that
item
apply
to
him,
and
no
response
is
made
to
an
inmate
if
he
requests
the
board
specifically
to
tell
him
whether
it
is
correctional
treatment,
vocational
treatment,
educational
treatment
or
job
assignment
that
they
are
concerned
with.
the
second
part
of
the
form
is
entitled
correctional
deficiencies.
it’s
commendable
that
the
board
would
want
to
tell
the
inmates
how
to
correct
their
deficiencies,
but
six
listed
deficiencies
are
stated
on
that
form,
and
in
379
i
think
the
figure
is,
out
of
385
cases
covered
in
the
survey
in
the
back
of
the
appendix,
the
inmates
had
all
six
items
checked,
items
such
as
joining
self
improvement
clubs
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
inmate
was
a
member
of
every
self
improvement
club
at
the
penitentiary.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
yes
your
honor.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
can
answer
some
of
those
questions,
i
am
not
sure
i
can
answer
all
of
them
for
you
your
honor.
the
board
is
a
five-member
board,
there
of
which
are
part
time,
two
of
which
are
--
three
of
which
are
full
time,
two
of
which
are
part
time.
they
are
appointed
by
the
governor
of
the
state.
could
you
repeat
some
of
your
other
questions
to
me
your
honor?
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
believe
they
do.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
i
think
i
am
going
to
have
to
defer
to
mr.
gillan
because
he
works
with
them
on
a
daily
basis
and
i
--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
they
do
have
a
staff,
i
do
not
know
how
large
that
staff
is,
they
do
much
of
their
own
work.
i
will
acknowledge
they
do
much
of
their
own
work
and
that
we
are
creating
a
system
which
may
require
them
to
hire
additional
staff
or
put
on
hearing--
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
three
permanent
members
your
honor.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
no
they
are
not,
they
are
separate.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
they
are
compensated.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
all
five
of
them,
they
are
compensated.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
no,
they
meet
more
frequently
than
that.
they
have
five
days
that
they
conduct
hearings
during
each
month.
one
of
those
days
is
at
the
woman’s
reformatory
and
for
the
youth
offenders,
while
two
others
days
are
spend
on
final
hearings.
the
two
days
that
i
was
referring
two
are
spend
on
review
hearings.
that’s
their
general
practice
throughout
the
year.
mr.
brian
k.
ridenour
no
i
am
not
your
honor.
i
really
could
not
tell
you
how
much
but
i
assume
they
do
spend
sometime
beforehand
looking
at
some
of
the
files
at
least
for
the
final
hearings.
review
hearings
i
think
the
process
is
generally
to
open
the
file
at
the
hearing
and
look
at
it
at
that
point,
just
because
of
the
sheer
numbers
they
are
dealing
with
at
that
point.
with
respect
to
the
interest
at
stake,
i
could
say
only
that
in
morrissey,
the
chief
justice
indicated
that
the
liberty
of
a
parolee
although
indeterminate
includes
many
of
the
core
values
of
unqualified
liberty,
by
whatever
name
that
liberty
is
valuable
and
must
be
seen
as
within
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
there
is
not
a
significant
difference
between
the
present
liberty
interest
whether
it
be
created
by
statute
or
it
arise
from
the
constitution
and
this
court
should
conclude
that
parole
in
nebraska
is--
and
parole
release
decisions
are
subject
to
the
due
process
clause
and
that
in
order
for
nebraska
to
comply
with
the
due
process
clause
the
inmate
must
be
afforded
a
reasonable
advance
notice,
a
meaningful
hearing,
a
record
of
those
proceedings,
and
the
opportunity
and
a
written
statement
of
the
reasons
for
denial
including
the
essential
facts
relied
upon.
so
that
he
may
specifically
know
what
it
is
that
he
needs
to
do
to
correct
his
behavior
and
to
perhaps
gain
a
parole
at
a
future
time.
