mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involve
the
question
of
whether
procedural
due
process
applies
in
the
granting
a
parole
and
if
so
the
extent
of
the
required
procedures.
as
this
court
is
aware
the
circuits
have
been
pretty
evenly
divided
on
this,
some
of
them
saying
that
no
procedural
due
process
applies
at
all
and
others
saying
that
it
applies
to
the
extent
that
reasons
must
be
given
for
the
denial
of
parole.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
fourth
circuit
in
franklin
versus
shield
required
more
extensive
procedures
and
the
court
sitting
en
banc
it
reversed
the
panel
and
said
that
the
only
procedures
required
was
giving
of
the
reasons
for
the
denial.
however,
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
mandated
very
extensive
procedures
of
requiring
that
each
inmate
be
given
a
formal
hearing
at
the
time
that
he
first
became
eligible,
that
he
be
given
notice
of
the
factors
that
would
be
considered
and
so
forth,
i
won’t
list
all
of
them.
the
most
important
one,
i
think
the
one
that
we
are
most
concerned
with
is
the
last,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
an
inmate
denied
parole
must
be
given
a
full
and
fair
explanation
in
writing
of
the
essential
facts
relied
on
and
the
reasons
for
denial.
now
we
have
no
objection
to
the
giving
out
the
reasons
for
denial,
because
under
state
law
he
is
now
required
to
be
given
the
reasons
for
denial,
but
when
the
board
is
required
to
given
him
a
full
and
fair
explanation
in
writing
of
the
essential
facts
relied
upon,
we
think
that
they
are
changing
the
entire
type
of
hearing
and
making
it
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
us
to
comply
with
that.
so
the
issues
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yeah,
it’s
very
true
your
honor
and
i
think
that
there,
there
may
well
be
a
strong
inclination
for
various
states
to
do
that
if
some
of
these
procedures
are
recorded.
now
so
our
question
here
is
whether
it
applies
at
all
and
whether
nebraska
has
complied
with
any
procedures
which
are
required
by
the
federal
constitution.
we
believe
that
there
are
two
basic
reasons
why
procedural
due
process
should
not
apply
to
the
granting
parole.
i
will
discuss
the
weaker
of
those
two
arguments
first.
first
we
believe
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
deprivation
of
a
right
which
has
already
been
granted,
a
freedom
which
has
been
granted
and
the
refusal
to
grant
that
freedom
in
the
first
place.
now
the
fifth
circuit
has
relied
pretty
exclusively
on
that
distinction
in
scarpa
versus
u.s.
parole
board
and
in
morrissey
versus
brewer,
this
court
quoted
with
approval
the
language
in
bay
versus
the
board
of
parole
drawing
that
distinction,
holding
that
there
is
a
difference
between
refusing
to
give
some
one
a
benefit
and
taking
away
a
benefit
which
are
already
been
given.
i
am
not
contending
that
that
distinction
should
be
decisive
in
this
case
because
i
can
visualize
a
situation
in
which
a
state
statute
provided
that
upon
proof
of
a
certain
set
of
facts
that
a
person
should
be
entitled
to
a
certain
benefit
or
conversely
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
a
certain
benefit
in
the
absence
of
proof
of
facts
or
certain
facts.
i
do
think
however
that
the
cases
indicate
that
the
showing
should
be
much
clearer
and
the
case
of
the
granting
of
a
benefit
and
that
the
procedures
that
would
be
required
would
probably
be
less
in
that
situation.
the
primary
reason
that
i
believe
the
--
that
procedural
due
process
should
not
apply
in
this
case,
if
that
under
state
law
there
are
no
provable
facts,
which
require
the
granting
of
parole
and
there
are
no
facts
which
must
be
proved
to
denial.
the
statute
that
nebraska
operates
under
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
first
of
all
it
makes
denial
of
parole
dependent
upon
the
parole
boards
having
an
opinion.
it’s
not
–
there
is
nothing
in
here
that
says
that
if
the
--
if
it
should
be
found
that
certain
facts
are
true
that
he
shall
be
granted
parole
that
or
that
he
may
be
denied
a
parole
in
the
event
certain
facts
are
established.
it
provides
whenever
the
board
of
parole
considers
release
of
a
committed
defender,
it
shall
order
his
release
unless
it
is
of
the
opinion
that
his
release
should
be
deferred.
and
then
look
at
the
factors
that
are
the
conditions
under
which
they
can
deny
it.
there
is
a
substantial
risk
that
he
will
not
confirm
to
the
conditions
of
parole.
what
facts
would
one
prove
that
would
show
that
there
is
a
substantial
risk
that
he
will
not
confirm
to
the
conditions
of
his
parole.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
they
would
be
purely
predictive
your
honor
and
then
the
next
is
even
less
susceptible
to
approve.
his
release
would
depreciate
the
seriousness
of
his
crime
or
promote
disrespect
for
law.
now
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
never
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i
am
startled
at
the
position
that
the
solicitor
general
has
taken
in
this
case
because
i
have
read
the
federal
act
and
i
find
it
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
nebraska
act
in
this
respect.
because
the
federal
act
also
says
that
the
inmate
shall
be
paroled
unless
the
parole
board
finds
and
i
believe
one
of
the
criteria
is
that
his
release
would
depreciate
the
seriousness
of
his
crime
or
promote
disrespect
for
law.
i
think
that
the
federal
act
is
very
similar
to
nebraska
act.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
i
think
that
he
has
attempted
to
make
a
distinction
--
i
think
that
he
has
misconstrued
our
act
and
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
because
–
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes,
the
act
say,
our
act
says
he
–
it
shall
order
his
release
and
they
apparently
take
the
position
that
they
confer
some
sort
of
an
entitlement,
but
the
distinction
that
i
draw
is
that
it
does
not
order
his
release
conditional
upon
the
finding
of
any
determinable
facts
or
any
provable
facts
that
no
one
is
capable
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
exactly,
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
they
certainly
could
be
hunches
and
very
often
it
maybe
based
on
nothing
more
than
the
parole
board’s
appraisal
of
the
man
as
he
stands
before
them.
they
may
reach
a
conclusion
as
to
his
character
from
simply
listening
to
him
and
watching
him
and
of
course
they
obviously
they
will
have
looked
at
his
record
to
see
what
previous
crimes
he
has
committed
and
how
many
convictions
he
has
had
and
what
he
has
done
in
the
penitentiary
and--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
certainly
it’s
not
an
exact
science
and
i
think
nobody
can
within
a
great
confidence
look
at
anyone
and
reach
a
conclusion
that
he
will
or
will
not
commit
further
crimes
but
nevertheless--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes,
i
think
the
word
came
from
the
chief
justice.
well,
no
one
has
got,
no
one
can
predict
with
any
certainty
that
this
man
will
or
will
not
commit
further
crimes.
the
parole
board
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
making
those
predictions
and
they
do
it
on
whatever
basis
they
have
and
they
are
frequently
wrong.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
definitely
not
of
course
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
you
made
it
clear
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
that
a
man
who
is
on
parole
has
an
expectation
founded
on
state
law
that
his
parole
will
not
be
terminated
in
the
absence
of
misconduct
and
so
unless
they
have
evidence
of
specific
misconduct
they
cannot
terminate
his
parole.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i
don’t
believe
that
it
would
be
and
i
haven’t
consider
that
however
–-
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
of
course
according
to
the
government’s
position
as
i
understand
it,
the
statute
could
provide
no
standards
whatever.
the
government
seems
to
takes
the
position
that
this
period,
this
could
be
in
the
complete
discretion
of
the
parole
board
with
no
standards
whatever
in
which
case
i
suppose
they
could
under
the
statute
at
least
to
do
it
on
any
basis
they
wished
on
the
whim
or
a
hunch
or
anything
that
they
saw
fit.
nebraska
has
seen
fit
to
lay
down
some
standards
for
the
parole
board
to
guide
them
and
they
exercise
their
discretion
and
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
no,
your
honor
he
is
not.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
no,
that’s
right,
he
does
not.
frequently,
i
believe
that
his
file
is
discussed
with
him
if
there
is
something
in
there
which
the
parole
board
feels
is
important
one
way
or
the
other
and
the
granting
or
denial
of
parole
that
matter
is
discussed
with
him,
but
there
is
no
guarantee
of
course
that
that
will
be
true
and
he
has
no
access
to
it.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i
say
that
there
is
no
liberty
interest,
because
the
liberty
interest
has
been
taken
away
from
him
by
his
conviction
and
sense.
and
that
liberty
interest
can
be
revived
only
in
the
event
that
a
state
statute
makes
provision
for
its
being
revived.
now,
in
a
situation
where
he
is
granted
a
parole
then
the
state
by
its
action
pursuant
to
the
statute
has
recreated
the
liberty
interest
and
has
provided
that
cannot
be
taken
away
from
him
in
the
absence
of
misconduct.
but
until
that
liberty
interest
is
recreated
it
does
not
exist.
i
believe
that
this
matter
has
to
be
considered
pretty
much
in
property
right
term,
property
interest
terms
which
must
be
created
by
a
state
statute
in
this
situation
and
unless
we
find
an
interest
created
by
state
statute
in
a
parole
then
it
doesn’t
exist
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
it
does
your
honor,
but
it
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
it
is
not
dependent
upon
facts
there
are
no
facts.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
that’s
correct
and
there
are
--
there
is
nothing,
now
if
we
look
at
a
due
process
hearing
as
an
attempt
to
discover
facts
decisive
of
rights,
there
are
no
facts.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
if
the
sentence
is
for
10
years.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
he
is
not
in
jail
then
for
sure
to
the
sentence.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
the
sentence
of
10
years
is
imposed
by
the
court
pursuant
to
law
after
the
expiration
of
that
10
years,
he
is
no
longer
being
detained
pursuant
through
the
sentence,
he
is
simply
being
detained
by
unlawful
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes,
because
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
a
deprivation
of
liberty?
what’s
the
difference?
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
no
it’s
certainly,
not
any
guarantee
of
liberty.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes,
that’s
right
your
honor
conditioned
upon
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
that’s
correct.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
but
it
is
condition.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
unless
it
can
be
on
its
condition.
whenever
the
board
of
parole
considers
a
release
of
a
committed
offender
who
is
eligible
for
release
on
parole
it
shall
order
his
release
unless
it
is
of
the
opinion
that
his
release
should
be
referred
because
there
is
substantial
risk
that
he
will
not
confirm
to
the
conditions
of
parole.
b,
his
release
would
depreciate
the
seriousness
of
his
crime
or
promote
disrespect
for
law.
his
release
would
have
a
substantially
adverse
effect
on
institutional
discipline
or
d,
his
continued
correctional
treatment,
medical
care
or
vocation,
or
other
training
in
the
facility
will
substantially
enhance
his
capacity
to
lead
a
law
abiding
life
on
release
at
a
later
date.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
correct,
as
i
cite
in
my
brief,
there
are
two
states,
i
think
as
i
believe
it
is
kansas
and
iowa,
which
have
substantially
identical
statutes,
not
as
elaborate
as
this
but
in
one
of
them
they
say
“shall”
and
the
other
one
they
say
“may”
or
“shall
have
the
power
to”
and
it
would
be
preposterous
i
think
to
say
that
there
is
a
difference
because
in
the
one
case
it
would
be
saying
that
the
state
parole
board
could
reach
a
conclusion
that
he
should
be
released
and
that
there
is
no
reason
why
he
shouldn’t
be
released
and
the
statutory
criteria
had
been
met
and
yet
because
it
said
that
they
shall
have
the
power
to
do
so
that
they
could
keep
him
in
the
penitentiary
simply
because
it
didn’t
say
“shall”.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i
inferred,
no
one
suggests.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
certainly.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes,
they
do.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
they
certainly
have
a
duty
to
attempt
to
obey
the
law
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
i
think
no
one
has
suggested
that
that
they
don’t
do
it.
they
reach
the
--
if
they
reach
the
conclusion
that
he
should
be
released
they
release
him.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
if
i’d
may,
unless
there
are
further
questions.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
if
they
were
to
make
the
finding
off
the
record
that
they
were
listed,
the
opinion
that
these
things
were
true
and
they
may,
such
a
finding
then
i
suspect
that
they
could
be
mandamus
to
release
him
or
perhaps
have--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
it
would
be
because
the
state
statute
entitled
them
to
their
liberty
if
the
court
order
make,
i
mean
the
parole
board
were
to
make
a
finding
that
they
were
of
the
opinion
that
all
of
these
things
had
been
met,
but
we
nevertheless
conclude
not
to
parole
him
for
some
undisclosed
reasons,
which
is
not
authorized
by
the
statute
then
i
think
that
they
would
be
entitled,
he
would
be
entitled
to
his
release
under
the
state’s
statute.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i
question
that,
i
haven’t
considered
it
your
honor,
so
i
would
like
to
give
that
some
thought
before
i.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
probably
we
don’t
want
to
put
record
in
writing.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
the
reason
we
don’t
want
to
put
it
in
writing
is
that,
it
would
convert
the
hearing
from
a
determination
of
these
purely
subjective
matters
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
it
would
probably
require
the
parole
board
to
make
a
record
and
present
evidence
which
would
justify
a
denial.
many
times
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
they
go
through
yes
i
assume.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
i’m
sure
that
they.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
suppose
that
the
reason
that
they
decided
that,
not
to
grant
this
man
a
parole
was
that
because
of
the
nature
of
his
crime
his
release
would
depreciate
the
seriousness
of
his
crime
or
promote
disrespect
for
law.
that’s
just
a
general
subjective
feeling
of
the
members
of
the
board
of
parole
that
this
man
has
convicted
a
–
have
been
convicted
a
very
serious
crime
and
that
to
release
him
now
would
depreciate
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
now,
if
they
have
got
to
present
evidence
to
show
that
i
don’t
know
how
they
would
do
it.
we
had
a
man
who
was
convicted
of
robbery
and
in
the
process
of
their
robbery
he
gouts
the
women
witnesses
eyes
out
to
prevent
her
from
identifying.
the
parole
board
is
going
to
feel
that
he
should
probably
never
be
paroled
but
how
does
one
present
any
evidence.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
that
could
be
given
as
a
reason
perhaps
but
to
present
evidence
i
think
that
it
would
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yeah,
that’s
the
record
but
how
is
that
evidence
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
but
is
that
evidence
that
his
release
would
depreciate
the
seriousness
of
his
crime
or
promote
disrespect?
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
well,
so
many
times
it
is
purely
subjective
and
it’s
simply
something
that
is
not
susceptible
of
factual
proof.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
he
was
convicted
of
robbery
your
honor
and
was
given
50
years
and
the
minimum
sentence
for
robbery
is
3
years.
so
he
may
have
been
given
something
like
20
to
50,
but
the
maximum
he
was
given
was
50
--
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
the
allowable
maximum
was
50,
that
was
the
maximum
term
he
was
given,
and
the
greatest
minimum
he
could
be
given
would
be
one-third
of
50.
so
he
couldn’t
have
been
given
more
than
about
16
years
as
a
minimum
and
at
the
end
of
16
years
he
would
be
eligible
for
parole.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
that’s
correct.
everybody
is
eligible
for
parole
after
one-third
of
the
maximum
sentence
and
-–
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yeah,
regardless
of
what
the
judge
may
want
to
do.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
yes,
they’re
eligible
after
serving
one-third
of
the
statutory
maximum
sentence.
mr.
ralph
h.
gillan
we’ve,
not
your
honor
except
that
i
will
say
that
the
attorney
general’s
office
does
not
work
with
the
parole
board
on
a
daily
basis,
and
so
we
are
not
as
intimately
familiar
with
their
procedures
as
mr.
ridenour
would
indicate.
i
will
answer
one
question,
they
serve
six
year
terms
and
they
have
a
secretarial
staff
only.
they
have
--
there
are
parole
counselors
at
the
penitentiary,
but
they
do
not
serve
under
the
parole
board
and
the
parole
board
has
no
control
of
them.
the
only
staff
that
the
parole
board
has
is
secretarial.
