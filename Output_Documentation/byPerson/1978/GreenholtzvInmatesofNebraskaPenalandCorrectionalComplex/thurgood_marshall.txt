and
then
also
concludes
that
all
people
like
him
are
bound
to
commit
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we’ll
judge
looking
his
face.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
you
get
the
hunch
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
mind
reading
that
statute
again
it
puts
an
option
in
them,
didn’t
that
--
would
shall
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
an
option?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
share
your
idea
with
option?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
you
not
responsible
for
delaware,
but
is
that
true
that
today
we’ve
had
two
unique
arguments,
one
is
the
man
can
be
put
in
jail
on
the
hunch
and
the
other
is
that
he
can
be
kept
there
on
a
hunch.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
then
state
delaware
doesn’t
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does
applied
in
nebraska.
justice
thurgood
marshall
federal
constitution
does
apply
to
nebraska.
is
that
a
part
of
the
reason
why
you
don’t
want
to
put
it
down
in
writing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
reasons
for
not
granting
the
parole.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
board
admits
that
and
on
each
case
they
go
through
each
one
of
these
four
points.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
requires
them
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
could
they
just
make
a
note
on
each
one
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wouldn’t
be
--
if
we
had
then
it
would
be
in
the
record
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
records
in
this
case
show
the
man
gouts
down
the
woman’s
eyes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is,
i
have
a
question
what
they
say.
i’m
just
questioning
why
they
can’t
say
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
hearing
with
a
lawyer,
i
shudder.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
can
ask
some
of
the
inmates
or
someone
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
their
expectations,
don't
you,
because
he
doesn’t
have
any
liberty
now?
