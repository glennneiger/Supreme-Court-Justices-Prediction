the
case
is
submitted
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
greenholtz
against
inmates
of
nebraska
correctional
institution.
mr.
gillan
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

one
way
to
comply
might
be
to
abolish
of
parole.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
way
to
comply
it
might
be
to
abolish
the
parole
system.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that
might
show
that
he
had
done
parole
three
times
previously
and
that
all
was
broken,
his
conditions
with
parole
that
could
be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
hunches,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
his
behavior
record
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
got
it
from
me,
didn’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
i
put
the
question
to
you,
a
proposition
to
you
counsel
which
is
in
the
sense
judge
hutcheson
of
the
fifth
circuit
used
at
once
in
a
rather
notable
article.
in
that
sense
do
you
think
that
a
parole
officer
and
the
parole
board
could
terminate
parole
on
the
basis
of
a
hunch
that
this
fellow
was
likely
to
get
into
trouble?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that’s
the
distinction
you
make
that
when
it
comes
to
granting
parole
they
have
a
vastly
wider
range
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
justice
stevens
hypothesis,
is
that
a
guarantee
of
liberty
as
the
constitution
guarantees
your
liberty
and
my
liberty
right
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
an
option
for
possible
release,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
wrote
all
those
things
off
that
probably
could
be
mandamus
because
the
discretionary
factor
would
all
be
washed
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
would
have
found
all
the
things
necessary
to
release
him
therefore
have
to
be
a
mandamus
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
alsup?
i
know
that
you
said
in
your
mixed
brief
that
the
re-acknowledge
the
government
acknowledges,
the
requirement
of
statement
of
reasons
has
become
an
accepted
part
of
due
process
safeguards
then
also
sentencing
judge
is
oppress
to
grant
probation
and
suppose
let’s
defense
counsel
argue
that
as
they
often
do
and
then
he
precedes
to
sentence
a
man
to
10
to
30
years
or
3
to
9
years,
does
the
sentencing
judge
give
reasons
for
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
statements
are
little
bit
sweetening
isn’t
that
you?
now
in
your
brief
at
page
45,
little
bit
broad.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
in
these
circumstances,
you
regard
the
circumstances
the
same
in
morrissey
and
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
quite
different,
aren’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
federal
system
particularly
on
many
of
the
states,
inmates
are
released
on
what’s
now
called
work
release
very
frequently
independent
of
any
statute
and
independent
of
the
parole
system
they
want
to
go
somewhere
and
work
on
a
job
and
report
back.
would
you
think
that
once
an
inmate
is
allowed
to
go
and
work
on
a
job,
he
has
acquired
some
new
or
different
interest
from
what
he
had
before
he
was
allowed
to
go
on
a
work
release
program?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
state
that
federal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
okay.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
the
jury
defer
a
little
bit
more
when
there
is
a
judge
of
a
particular
state
sitting
on
the
panel
although
that
doesn’t
ride
us
to
constitutional
dimensions
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
alsup,
thank
you.
mr.
ridenour?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
about
the
question
i
put
first
to
you
on
brandon,
if
a
judge
who
has
the
option
to
grant
probation
at
the
time
of
the
verdict
permits
a
hearing,
an
argument
on
whether
it
should
be
granted
and
then
simply
without
any
elucidation
denies
probation
and
sentences
this
defendant
to
traditional
term,
must
you
give
reasons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
trying
to
find
it
out.
i’m
trying
to
see
if
there’s
some
analogy.
what
if
he
then
carried
on
suppose
he
–
the
counsel
says
i’d
like
to
argue
and
present
some
evidence
as
to
why
you
should
grant
probation
here
and
the
judge
says
no
i
don’t
need
any
argument
and
i
don’t
need
any
evidence,
i’ll
decide
this
matter
on
my
own
and
he
adjourns
court
and
later
or
at
this
very
time
opposes
the
sentence
10
to
30
years,
3
to
9
years,
must
he
give
reasons,
must
he
conduct
the
hearing,
it’s
been
the
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
now
that’s
all
have
been
terminated
with
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
most
states
as
you’ll
find
the
statute
that
permits
the
judge
to
grant
probation,
does
that
create
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
judge
might
grant
probation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
almost
exactly
the
same
thing
if
the
judge
is
required
to
say
why
he
denies
probation,
and
then
denies
it,
and
the
prisoner
goes
to
the
institution
he
has
got
a
little
bit
of
a
idea
of
what
he
should
do
in
order
to
qualify
for
a
parole,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
decide
in
our
cases
without
argument
than
with
argument,
don’t
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
mentioned
645
hearings.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
seven
minutes,
seven
minutes
was
the
average.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
take
at
that
means
that
some
hearings
might
have
been
30
minutes
and
some
might
have
been
two
minutes
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
of
course
in
many
courts,
including
this
one.
some
matters
are
resolved
with
finality,
with
no
--
not
only
no
hearing,
no
discussion,
just
after
the
justices
have
reviewed
the
papers.
do
you
suggest
there’s
any
denial
of
due
process
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
now
when
you
talk
about
the
informal
procedure
the
very
purpose,
historic
purpose
of
procedure
and
formality
is
to
speed
up
the
process
instead
of
letting
people
just
wander
all
over
the
lot
and
talk
at
will
in
any
form
they
want.
so
how
much
time
do
you
think
it
will
take
to
conduct
all
the
hearings
that
you
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
done
a
calculation
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
guess
that
would
double
or
triple
or
add
50%
or
add
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
we
should
tell
nebraska
how
many
of
its
parole
officers
should
sit
in
that
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if,
what
if
the
record
showed
that
a
particular
inmate
coming
up
for
eligibility
and
his
record
is
being
processed
in
the
board
and
by
the
staff
and
it
shows
that
seven
times
in
four
years
he
was
put
in
solitary
confinement
for
assaulting
fellow
prisoners
and
guards,
and
the
most
recent
being
within
30
days.
chairman
of
the
parole
board
says
that,
no
use
of
even
wasting
seven
minutes
on
this
fellow,
no
hearing
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
what
we
are
suggesting.
morrissey
is
the
only
reason
for
holding
it,
but
suppose
there
is
only
one
john
mccormick
doe
in
the
entire
prison,
and
the
chairman
says,
check
this
out
and
they
say,
yes
there
is
only
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
part-time
people
put
in
only
two
days
a
month
in
the
aggregate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
right
well,
do
you
have
something
further
in
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
