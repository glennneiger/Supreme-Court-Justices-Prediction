justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
just
another,
supposing
the
statute
provided
a
10-year
term,
the
man
was
in
jail.
the
expiration
of
the
10-year
term
they
decided
just
to
keep
him
in
jail,
would
he
deprive
of
his
liberty?
he
is
already
in
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
he
is
already
in
jail,
has
he
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
if
he
just
stays
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
the
question
is
whether
the
deprivation
is
a
deprivation
of
liberty
when
he
is
kept
in
jail
longer
than
the
law
provides.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
he
being
deprived
from
his
liberty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
he
been
deprived
with
his
liberty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
why
not
if
at
the
end
of
the
parole
eligibility
period
there
is
a
law
that
says
he
is
entitled
to
get
out
unless
certain
conditions
are
present.
why
hasn’t
he
then
deprived
of
his
liberty
if
they
keep
him
in
contrary
to
those
provisions
of
law
because,
what’s
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
this
were
dependent
upon
a
factual
determination
then
i
would
say
that
if
the
facts
that
were
true
that
conditionally
give
him
his
liberty,
then
perhaps
he
would
be
deprived
of
a
liberty
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
alsup,
on
that
point
supposing
nebraska
adopted
a
statute
that
said
that
the
revocation
of
parole
shall
be
purely
discretionary
with
the
parole
board.
okay
do
it
on
a
hunch
for
any
arbitrary
reasons,
so
that
be
no
reasonable
expectation
of
continued
parole
if
the
board
decided
to
change
its
mind
and
such
a
statute
would
be
constitutional
on
your
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
under
the
rationale
of
morrissey
against
brewer
just
going
and
staying
in
the
four
corners
of
that
opinion
the
statute
i
described
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
on
your
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
listed
in
your
brief
in
some
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
it
follow
then
that
such
a
statute
would
be
constitutional.
are
you
saying
even
on
parole
revocation
that
the
parolee’s
right
to
a
hearing
is
entirely
based
on
a
statutory
grant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that’s
right
and
the
parolee
when
he’s
released
gets
a
copy
of
the
statute
and
he’s
told
if
we
get
worried
about
the
way
you’re
behaving
even
if
we
don’t
have
any
proof
of
anything
at
all
we
have
the
power
to
revoke
your
parole
like
that.
is
then
that
statute
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i’m
familiar
with
arnett
case,
i’m
just
curious
about
whether
the
government
has
a
position
on
the
question
which
i’ve
asked
you
which
you,
would
you
willing
identify
for
us.
you
surely
have
thought
about
it
before
you
came
here
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know
but
if
you
just
decline
to
answer
you
say
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ridenour
what
if
the
nebraska
law
simply
listed
these
factors
just
like
they
are
and
said,
the
decisions
shall
be
entirely
within
the
discretion
of
the
parole
officers
and
not
subjected
to
judicial
review,
it
is
completely
within
the
discretion
of
the
parole
boards.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
says
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to--
is
hear
the
factors
then
you
apply
it.
but
i
suppose
you
could
say,
couldn’t
you?
and
i
think
our
cases
might
indicate
this,
you
could
have
a
liberty
of
property
interest,
but
no
right
to
procedures
simply
because
the
hearing
would
do
no
good.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
--
at
the
most
so
far
what
you’re
saying
is
that
the
inmate
should
be
assured
that
they
went
through
the
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
has
very
much
to
do
with
the
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
the
statutes
said
that
when
they
are
through,
they
will
certify
what
they
did.
they,
we
considered
the
following
factors
and
we
exercised
our
discretion,
we
arrived
at
this
conclusion.
and
if
you
had
a
hearing,
if
you
put
him
on
the
stand,
they
would
say,
yes
we
considered
every
one
of
them.
and
the
statute
says,
the
result
is
within
your
discretion.
now
does
due
process
require
anymore
than
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
he
might
have
an
opportunity
to
make
sure
they
considered
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
you
should
be
able
to
testify
or
call
witnesses?
