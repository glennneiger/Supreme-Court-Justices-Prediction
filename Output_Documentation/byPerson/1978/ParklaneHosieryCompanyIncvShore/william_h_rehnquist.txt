justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
to
parlay
that
together
with
the
non-mutuality
doctrine
which
did
not
existed
in
1791,
don't
you,
in
order
to
make
your
case
come
out
alright?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
got
to
win
both
of
them
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
have,
so
far.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
your
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
you've
just
described,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
should've
been
granted
by
a
court
before
blonder-tongue
was
decided
and
while
triplett
was
still
the
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
you
deal
with
just
with
the
cases
from
this
court,
since
i
for
once,
i
don't
pretend
to
be
familiar
with
all
the
court
of
appeals
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
then
rely
on
blonder-tongue
outside
of
the
patent
area
and
as
a
virtually
an
absolute
rule
that
justifies
summary
judgment
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
could
they
have
done
in
order
to
obtain
a
right
to
jury
trial
in
the
private
action
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
ordinarily,
the
gov
--
the
sec
action
will
have
a
priority
that
the
private
action
won't,
won't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
require
them
to
answer
in
20
days,
can't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
if
that's
the
case,
isn't
this
invariably
going
to
give
the
private
plaintiff
two
bites
that
that
appellee
can
just
hold
back
until
after
the
government's
case
is
tried?
if
the
government
wins,
he
wins.
if
the
government
loses,
he
gets
his
bite
--
second
bite
at
the
output.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
government
loses
its
case,
the
private
plaintiff,
by
your
answer
to
justice
white,
isn't
bound.
he
has
his
own
day
in
court
and,
if
the
government
wins,
he
simply
hitches
his
card
under
the
government's
victory.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
take
the
antitrust
statute
where,
as
i
recall,
there's
a
provision
that
in
certain
circumstances,
and
this
is
by
act
of
congress,
judgment
in
favor
of
the
government
can
be
used
as
a
prima
facie
case.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
securities
act
like
that,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
don't
you
think
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
passed
that
in
the
securities
and
exchange
act
was
to
give
private
claims
a
benefit
rather
than
a
detriment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
mr.
