justice
potter
stewart
and
blonder-tongue,
of
course,
in
volved
the
validity
vel
non
of
a
patent.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
it?
and,
let's
assume
that
a
patent
had
held
to
be
--
was
held
to
be
invalid
in
the
second
circuit
and
then
in
the
third
circuit,
and
that
had
been
done
in
a
non-jury
trial
because
nobody
had
asked
for
jury
determination.
and
then,
in
the
third
circuit,
the
issue
of
the
--
that
same
patent's
validity
was
raised
in
litigation,
and
the
person
asserting
the
validity
of
the
patent
said
“well,
i
want
a
jury
trial
on
this
issue.”
does
that
mean
that
the
matter
of
estoppel
just
could
not
possibly
prevail
because
of
the
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
question
--
in
my
case,
there
is
now.
in
the
hypothetical
case
embodied
in
my
question
there
is
a
jury
trial
question
raised.
the
original
determination
of
invalidity
was
made
in
a
non-jury
trial.
now,
the
same
issue
is
raised
in
a
different
circuit
involving
the
validity
of
the
same
patent,
and
the
person
asserting
its
validity
says
“i
want
a
jury
trial
and
there
cannot
possibly
be
collateral
estoppel
because
there
wasn't
jury
trial
in
the
other
case.”
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
--
i
suppose
the
difference
between
the
hypothetical
case
embodied
in
my
question
and
those
three
cases
that
you've
just
mentioned
to
us
and
the
conclusion
implicit
in
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
is
that,
here,
there
was
no
--
you
couldn't
have
gotten
a
--
you
couldn't
have
had
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
action
no
matter
how
hard
you
tried.
justice
potter
stewart
you
simply
had
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
give
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
whole
presupposition
of
beacon
theatres
was
that
if
the
equity
case
were
tried
first,
it
would
be
res
judicata?
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
i
dissented
in
that
case,
so
i'm
perhaps
not
--
don't
understand
it
as
well
as
you
do.
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
is
you
won
each
of
them
and
now
you're
just
combining
them.
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
won
each
of
them.
they've
been
won
by
your
predecessors,
and
now
you
just
seek
to
combine
the
two
victories.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rosen,
i
didn't
understand
whether
or
not
you
conceded
the
correctness
of
my
brother
rehnquist's
assumption
in
his
question
to
you,
that
the
plaintiff
gets
to
the
effect
that
the
plaintiff
gets
two
bites
at
the
apple
if
the
government
loses.
the
plaintiff
can
still
try
its
case
if
the
government
loses
in
the
sec
case.
if
the
sec
loses,
then
the
private
plaintiff,
the
shareholder,
can
still
try
his
case
de
novo
without
any
effect
of
that
prior
determination.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
in
the
sec
case
that
the
court
had
found
as
a
fact
that
there
were
no
material
misstatements.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
wouldn't
that
be
a
benefit
to
the
defendant
in
your
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
why,
just
to
get
back
to
my
question,
why
wouldn't
the
defendant
be
able
to
use
that
determination
in
the
prior
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
were
no
material
misstatements
by
--
in
this
proxy
material
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
i
am
--
i
was
correct
in
my
apprehension
that
you
conceded
the
correctness
of
the
proposition
implicit
to
my
brother
rehnquist
question.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
polysyllabic
way
of
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
respondent
brought
this
stockholder’s
class
action
against
the
petitioners
in
a
federal
district
court.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
petitioners,
parklane
hosiery
company
and
12
of
its
officers,
directors
and
stockholders,
had
issued
a
materially
false
and
misleading
proxy
statement
in
connection
with
a
merger.
before
the
action
came
to
trial,
the
sec
filed
suit
against
the
same
defendants
in
a
federal
district
court
alleging
that
the
proxy
statement
that
had
been
issued
by
parklane
was
materially
false
and
misleading
in
essentially
the
same
respects
as
those
that
had
been
alleged
in
the
respondent’s
complaint.
injunctive
relief
was
requested.
after
a
4-day
trial,
the
district
court
found
that
the
proxy
statement
was
materially
false
and
misleading
in
the
respects
alleged
and
entered
a
declaratory
judgment
to
that
effect.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
judgment.
the
respondent
as
the
plaintiff
in
the
present
case
then
moved
for
partial
summary
judgment
against
the
petitioners
asserting
that
the
petitioners
were
collaterally
estopped
from
relitigating
the
issues
that
had
been
resolved
against
them
in
the
equity
action
brought
by
the
sec.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
such
an
application
of
collateral
estoppel
would
deny
the
petitioners
their
seventh
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
holding
that
a
party
who
has
had
issues
of
fact
determined
against
him
after
a
full
trial
and
a
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
in
a
non-jury
trial
is
collaterally
estopped
from
obtaining
a
subsequent
jury
trial
of
the
same
issues
of
fact.
the
appellate
court
concluded
and
unfolding
the
seventh
amendment
preserves
the
right
to
jury
trial
only
with
respect
to
issues
of
fact,
and
once
those
issues
have
been
fully
and
fairly
adjudicated
in
a
prior
proceeding,
nothing
remains
for
trial,
either
with
or
without
a
jury.
because
of
an
intercircuit
conflict,
we
granted
certiorari.
for
the
reason
sent
out
in
considerable
detail
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
clerk
this
morning,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
specifically,
we
hold
that
the
use
of
so-called
offensive
collateral
estoppel
was
permissible
in
this
case
and
that
it
choose
did
not
deprive
the
petitioners
of
any
constitutional
right.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
