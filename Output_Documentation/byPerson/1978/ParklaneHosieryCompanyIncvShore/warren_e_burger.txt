chief
justice

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
1305,
parklane
hosiery
against
shore.
mr.
levitt,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
“similar,”
are
they
more
than
similar?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
as
to
who
initiated
the
case
in
terms
of
the
legal
principles
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean,
the
choice
of
a
jury
waiver
would
be
one,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
this
be
equally
true
of
any
equity
case
in
a
court
as
distinguished
from
a
regulatory
agency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
not
tracking
--
perhaps,
i
didn't
make
my
question
clear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
jury
in
an
sec
case,
not
even
a
discretionary
power
arising,
i
suspect,
on
the
part
of
sec
to
call
a
jury
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
equity
judge
could
conceivably
have
the
power
from
some
factual
question
unusual,
but
he
could
call
in
a
jury
and
submit
certain
questions,
couldn't
he,
possibly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
been
done.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
isn't
the
normal,
but
what's
the
basic
difference
if
the
case
is
tried
to
judgment
in
the
equity
court
with
no
jury
and
the
case
is
tried
to
a
determination
in
the
sec
with
no
jury?
why
do
you
distinguish
those
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
rosen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-1305,
parklane
hosiery
against
shore
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
