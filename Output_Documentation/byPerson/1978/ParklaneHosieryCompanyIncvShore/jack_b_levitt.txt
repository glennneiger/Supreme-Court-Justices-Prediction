mr.
jack
b.
levitt
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
issue
presented
in
this
appeal
is
whether
a
litigant
loses
his
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
jury
by
estoppel
when
the
issue
to
be
decided
has
been
adjudicated
adversely
to
him
in
a
prior
sec
injunction
action,
at
which,
there
was
no
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
and,
in
which,
its
present
adversary
was
not
a
party.
the
facts
are
these.
parklane
hosiery
affected
a
going
private
transaction
in
october
1974
by
means
of
a
merger
in
which
a
proxy
was
issued
to
its
shareholders.
a
month
later,
in
november
1974,
this
class
action
was
commenced
on
behalf
of
all
the
stockholders
of
the
corporation,
except
those
who
had
exercised
their
statutory
dissenter's
rights.
the
class
action
proceeded
to
a
class
certification
and
to
commencement
of
discovery.
in
may
1976,
a
year-and-a
half
after
the
class
action
had
began
and
after
the
merger
had
been
accomplished,
the
sec,
under
the
authority
of
section
21
of
the
1934
exchange
act
authorizing
injunction
actions,
commenced
an
action
for
an
injunction
and
other
relief
alleging
as
its
grounds
certain-claimed
material
misrepresentations
and
omissions
by
parklane
in
its
proxy
state--
proxy
statement.
two
weeks
after,
the
sec
started
its
independent
action.
the
respondents
here,
the
plaintiffs
in
the
class
action,
moved
to
amend
their
complaint
so
as
to
precisely
track,
to
fall
in
behind,
the
allegations
of
the
sec
injunction
complaint.
pursuant
to
rules
which
permit
prompt
trial
of
sec
injunction
actions,
the
sec
injunction
action
came
on
to
be
tried
with
about
one
month
after
it
was
commenced,
in
june
of
1976
and
while
the
class
action
here
was
in
an
early
stage
of
discovery.
after
trial,
in
september
1976,
the
district
judge
who
had
heard
the
sec
injunction
proceeding
found
that
parklane
had
violated
the
securities
laws
in
the
three
precise
respects
that
the
sec
had
alleged,
the
three
material
omissions
or
misrepresentations.
but,
the
district
judge
denied
the
injunction
which
was
the
route
remedy
that
the
sec
had
requested
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
basis
for
an
injunction.
that
the
merger
had
long
since
been
accomplished
that
there
was
no
evidence
and
not
even
a
contention,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
any
ongoing
conduct
that
would
suggest
a
concern--
a
public
concern
for
continuing
wrongs
or
violations
of
the
securities
law.
just
after
the
judgment
in
the
sec
proceeding
in
november,
i
believe,
1976,
the
respondent
here
moved
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
issues
which
had
been
adjudicated
in
the
sec
non-jury
injunction
proceeding
on
the
theory
that,
because
the
sec
injunction
proceeding
had
included
similar
issues
of
fact,
the
petitioner
here
was
collaterally
estopped
from
re-litigating
those
issues.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
they
are
precisely
the
same,
mr.
justice
burger,
as
the
issues
contained
in
the
amended
complaint
or
embraced
in
the
amendment.
there
were
some
other
claims
in
the
class
action
and,
of
course,
there
would
be
other
issues,
at
least
including
damages,
still
for
trial.
that's
the
sense
in
which
it
was
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment.
but,
to
answer
what
i
believe
is
the
purpose
of
one
of
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
the
request
for
partial
summary
judgment
was
co-extensive
with
the
findings
of
violation
that
had
been--
that
had
occurred
in
the
sec
proceeding.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment.
in
a
short
decision,
motion
denied
and
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment
--
on
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
rachal
against
hill,
a
1970
fifth
circuit
decision.
on
appeal,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court,
directed
the
entry
of
the
summary
judgment
which
had
been
requested
and,
in
effect,
determine
that
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
in
this
instance
or
to
extinguish
the
right
to
a
trial
jury
that
the
petitioner
otherwise
concededly
would've
had.
this
appeal
presents
to
the
court
for
the
first
time,
since
this
court's
decision
in
blonder-tongue,
a
question
of
the
proper
reach
and
application
of
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
in
the
absence
of
mutuality.
and,
petitioners
contend
here
very
briefly
that
the
test,
the
historical
inquiry,
as
to
the
law
in
1791
as
a
basis
for
determining
the
scope
and
limits
of
seventh
amendment
jury
trial
rights.
if
applied
in
accordance
with
what
we
contend
is
a
fairly
straightforward
following
of
the
cases
of
this
court,
dimick
against
schiedt
and,
very
recently,
curtis
against
loether
and
others,
demonstrate
that
respondent
couldn't
have
been
estopped
collaterally
from
a
jury
trial
of
his
defenses
in
1791
or,
indeed,
until
the
very
recent
relaxation
of
the
mutuality
of
estoppels
rule
and
can't
now
be
so-estopped.
we
believe
also
that
that
result
is
squarely
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
beacon
theatres,
dairy
queen,
and
other
cases
and
that
the
rachal
decision,
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
1970
which,
until
this
case,
was
the
only
case
which
presented
an
interface
or
a
challenge
to
the
seventh
amendment
by
the
new
concept
of
non-mutual
estoppel
which
had
held
to
the
contrary
that
a
jury
trial
could
not
be
extinguished
by
this
mechanism,
quite
properly
analyze
the
law,
and
this
court's
decisions
on
the
issue.
and,
finally,
we'll
contend
that
this
court's
refusal,
for
which
of
course
we
shall
contend,
to
apply
collateral
estoppel
in
the
circumstances
presented
in
this
case
would
be
wholly
consistent
with
the
blonder-tongue
principle
that
it
is
a
--
that
non-mutual
estoppels,
even
if
the
formal
elements
may
be
present,
should
not
be
applied
where
justice
and
equity
dictate
otherwise.
now,
your
honors,
before
analysis
or
reference
to
the
decision
in
the
court
below,
i'll
briefly
summarize
to
you
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
rachal.
there,
the
sec
had
sought
and
obtained
an
injunction
against
corporate
behavior
in
an
se
--
in
a
securities
law
violation
context.
thereafter,
a
class
action
had
been
begun
and
the
class
action
plaintiffs,
using
the
sec
judgment
as
its
predicate,
sought
partial
--
sought
summary
judgment
much
as
is
being
attempted
on
this
case.
there,
the
fifth
circuit
squarely
held
that
collateral
estoppel
may
not
be
applied
so
as
to
deny
a
seventh
amendment
jury
trial
right.
and,
in
so
doing,
the
court
ackn
--
confronted
the
challenge
of
the
seventh
amendment
in
the
face
of
this
new
procedure
--
relatively
new
procedural
mechanism,
and
acknowledged
also
that
the
change
in
the
rules
of
mutuality
still
then
emerging,
and
i
believe
still
now
emerging,
but
noted
that
the
rule
should
not
apply
where
overriding
issues
of
fairness
dictate
otherwise.
the
rachal
court,
the
fifth
circuit
court,
analyzed
this
court's
decision
in
beacon
theatres,
referred
to
the
great
respect
which
its
language
and
its
decision
showed
to
the
preeminence
of
the
seventh
amendment
in
the
face
of
changing
procedural
mechanisms,
in
that
case,
the
federal
rules,
and
found
that
the
beacon
decision
led,
inevitably,
to
the
denial
of
estoppel.
turning
to
the
decision
in
the
second
circuit
court
below
--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
it
did.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
believe,
in
all
events,
that
in
the
blonder-tongue
context
there
was
no
jury
trial
question
raised
and,
moreover,
that--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
well,
your
honor,
in
--
i
don't
think
--
well,
addressing
myself
to
the
question
as
i
understand
it,
the
person
seeking
to
avoid
estoppel
in
the
second
case
that
you
put
would,
in
all
events,
be
entitled
to
a
trial.
the
question
is
whether
the
party
who
had
a
litigated
--
who
had
litigated
the
case
earlier,
in
this
case
the
--
in
the
blonder-tongue
case,
the
alleged
patent
holder
who
had
initiated
a
litigation
and
who,
in
the
litigation
which
he
had
initiated,
was
met
with
the
finding
of
invalidity
of
the
--
of
his
own
patent.
and,
blonder-tongue
said,
“having
being
confronted
with
an
--
a
determination
adverse
to
you
in
a
case
which
you
initiated,
you
can't
now
proceed
to
attempt
to
enforce
against
anybody.”
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
it
would
and,
your
honor,
while
i
--
as
i
think
we
will
see,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
is
not
at
all
essential
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
i
would
comment
upon
your
question
to
say
that
there
has
been
much
writing
and
speculation
about
the
distinction,
if
any,
and
the
weight
which
ought
to
be
accorded
to
it
between
the
so-called
defensive
use
of
mutual
estoppel
and
the
so-called
offensive
use.
i
say
“so-called”
because
many
people
contend
perhaps
with
some
force,
that
here
isn't
a
profound
or
a
structural
distinction
between
the
two.
i
don't
think
it,
at
all,
affects
the
line
of
reasoning
or
the
ultimate
decision
by
this
court
in
this
case.
i
would
say,
however,
in
response
to
your
question
that
i
find
some
concern
in
the
issue
of
whether
--
i
find
a
somewhat
different
standard,
a
somewhat
different
test,
probably
in
order,
in
considering
whether
a
subsequent
litigant
can
exploit
a
successful
litigation
by
a
predecessor
and
follow
it
by
attempting
to
get
summary
judgment,
attempted
to
get
judgment
almost
by
hypothesis
on
the
basis
of
that
earlier
adjudication.
i
would
be
concerned
about
many
factors
affecting
the
earlier
adjudication
and
its
implication
for
the
party
who
had
not
been
a
party
to
it
and
who
is
now
faced
with
confrontation
of
the
same
issue.
your
honor,
returning,
if
i
may,
to
the
decision
below.
the
second
circuit,
in
reversing,
held
exactly
to
the
contrary
of
rachal.
it
found
that
collateral
estoppel
would
apply
undisputedly,
except
for
the
jury
trial
issue.
it
reasoned
or
at
least
it
discovered
--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
surely,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
in
my
judgment
--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
in
my
judgment,
sir,
there
should
be.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
yes.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
i
don't
think
so,
sir,
for
several
reasons.
first
i
--
your
honor,
let
me
address
myself
to
your
question
in
the
following
fashion.
i
believe
that
the
offense
--
so-called
offensive
use
and
this
case,
to
my
knowledge,
and
as
well
as
the
rachal
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
presents
the
first
such
proposition
for
it
--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
deserves
a
different
test.
i
do
not
think,
your
honors,
that
it
will
be
crucial
by
almost
any
line
of
reasoning
to
your
honors'
decision
because
i
think
this
case
will
more
than
likely
be
presented
primarily
on
the
issue
of
its
seventh
amendment
implications,
but
what
--
but
i
do
believe
that
the
level
of
examination,
the
concern,
about
who
was
involved
in
the
prior
adjudication
and
what
were
the
implications
of
the
circumstances
of
that
prior
adjudication
for
the
party
sought
to
be
estopped
by
it,
and
the
second
action
of
who
was
innocent,
that
is
to
say,
who
was
innocent
of
any
participation.
who
had
no
participation
in
the
earlier
action,
probably,
should
be
a
higher
standard
and
should
be
a
matter
of
concern.
and,
to
try
and
follow
that
for
what
use
i
believe
it
may
have
for
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
think
the
fact
that
this
case
--
that
the
prior
adjudication
was
an
sec
injunction
proceeding.
for
example
is
one
which
ought
to
weigh
in
the
balance
of
whether
or
not
it
ought
to
estopp
the
follow
--
the
subsequent
party.
for
example,
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
the
relatively
few
cases
compared
to
the
much
writing
and
comment
on
this
subject,
cited
in
respondent's
brief
are
the
application
of
offensive
so-called
use
of
estoppel.
i
find
only
three
in
which
offensive
use
was
actually
applied,
and
i
find
there
that
in
each
of
those
three
cases
the
party
in
whose
shoes,
so
to
speak,
the
new
litigant
finds
himself,
was
a
party
of
exactly
identical
rank
or
interest,
so
to
speak,
in
the
litigation
of
that
issue,
as
was
the
later
party
sought
to
be
estopped.
for
example,
the
three
cases
that
i
can
recall
are
a
co-passenger
in
a
taxicab,
both
innocent,
both
victimized,
a
full
and
fair
opportunity,
a
jury
trial
right
in
the
first
action,
ergo,
offensive
estoppel.
i
do
not
find
--
apart
from
matters
of
legal
analysis,
my
sense
of
justice
isn't
troubled
by
that.
a
co-passenger
in
an
airplane,
a
mortgagee
versus
a
mortgager
successively
suing
an
insurance
carrier
arising
out
of
the
same
casualty
where
the
implication
and
the
facts
are
strong
that
the
litigant
to
the
earlier
case
had
the
same
kinds
of
concern,
the
same
view
of
the
litigation
as
could
be
presumed
to
be
that
of
the
party
of
the
second
litigation
who
was
sought
to
be
estopped.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
yes,
well
--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
i
don't
--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
only
a
matter
of
motivation.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
many
factors
which,
in
here,
in
a
litigant's
view
of
what
the
significance
and
implications
of
a
litigation
are
to
him
and,
no.
to
answer
your
question,
no,
i
don't
think
his
motivation
would've
been
less
to
defend
as
it
would
to
defend
a
private
party
action.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
precisely,
your
honor.
the
structure
of
the
earlier
adjudication
was
--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
yes.
number
one,
there
was
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
because
the
statute--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
evidencing
a
policy
very
well-expressed
in
the
government's
amicus
brief
here
that
the
sec
was
authorized
by
the
government
to
move
quickly
and
flexibly
to
enjoin
ongoing
wrongs
and,
therefore,
there
should
be
no
jury,
classic
equity
jurisdiction,
and
no
jury
trial
right.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so
because
of
the
implications
for
most
civil
litigation
of
the
federal
rules,
and
that
in
fact
relates
us
precisely
to
the
beacon
theatres
case
which
is
the
heart
of
what
the
second
and
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
have
been
arguing
about.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
correct.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
possibly,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
yes.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
let
me
tell
you
why
i
do
because
i
think
that
distinction
goes
very
much
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
presented
here.
beacon
theatres,
which
was
interpreted
in
precisely
contrary
manners
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit,
beacon
theatres
said
that,
in
the
face
of
the
federal
rules
which,
in
terms
of
the
merger
of
law
and
equity,
presented
both
what
used
to
be
equitable
and
legal
disputes
in
the
same
civil
action.
the
seventh
amendment,
with
its
command
to
continue
to
preserve
jury
trial
rights
in
the
sense
that
they
had
been
entitled
to
preservation
historically
and
in
accordance
with
the
long
line
of
this
court's
cases,
compelled
that
any
issues
of
fact
in
what
would
otherwise
be
a
mixed,
legal,
and
equitable
case
under
the
federal
rules,
must
needs
be
tried
by
a
jury
and
that
to
try
such
issues
of
fact
before
an
equity
court
would
violate
the
mandate
of
the
seventh
amendment
and
the
constitutional
right
of
a
litigant
to
it
advanced
the
traditional
common
law
claim.
and,
for
that
reason,
your
honor,
and
i
hope
i'm
being
responsive
to
your
question,
for
that
reason,
i
would
say
to
you
that
in
the
law
under
beacon
theatres,
under
dairy
queen,
and
under
meeker
against
ambassador
oil,
all
cited
and
discussed
in
the
brief,
the
law
is
clear
that
where
there
are
issues
of
fact
which
are
in
aid
of
equitable
claims
and
of
legal
claims,
you
may
not
extinguish
the
jury
right
created
by
those
legal
claims
by
a
prior
adjudication
in
equity.
that's
the
fair
and,
i
believe,
the
inevitable
interpretation
of
beacon
theatres
and
dairy
queen.
and,
i
might
say
in
that
connection
that
the
second
circuit
found
a
rather
unusually
narrow
interpretation
of
beacon
theatres.
it
said
in
substance,
and
i
hope
i'm
not
exaggerating
for
the
purpose
of
illuminating
the
second
circuit's
view,
it
said
in
substance
beacon
theatres
was
merely
a
scheduling
case.
it
concerned
itself
with
how
issues
ought
to
be
ordered
and
that's
why
it
came
up
in
a
mandamus
context
so
that
the
district
court
would
have
the
proper
direction
and
both
the
rational
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
and,
i
believe,
the
plaintiff's
kind
of
reading
of
justice
black's
opinion
for
the
majority
don't
at
all
admit
of
that
narrow
construction.
to
us
and
to
the
fifth
circuit,
it
was
a
very
ringing
affirmation
of
seventh
amendment
rights
when
confronted
by
the
new
structure
of
litigation
posed
by
the
federal
rules.
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
no,
your
honor.
that
certainly
is
the
interpretation
--
mr.
jack
b.
levitt
with
the
greatest
--
[laughter]
with
the
greatest
respect,
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
tell
you
why
i
think
not.
i
think
not
because
there
is
one
sentence
in
justice
black's
decision
for
the
majority
which
at
least
the
second
circuit
turned
to
or
it
was
the
only
one,
at
least
that
we
could
find,
which
could
be
argued
to
have
supported
the
proposition
that
it
ordered
pre-litigation
of
jury
issues
as
a--
one-half
of
a
two-sided
coin
of
permitting
estoppel
if
the
order
which
the
supreme
court
mandated
were
not
followed.
justice
black
made
one
comment
in
beacon
theatres,
and
that
was
in
the
context
of
characterizing
the
circuit
court
below's
concerns,
as
expressed
b
the
circuit
court,
and
justice
black
characterized
it,
at
least
in
substance,
by
saying
there
is
some
concern
expressed
that
if
the
equitable
issues
were
tried
first,
why,
then
an
estoppel
might
follow
of
the
legal
issues.
but,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
wold
sggest
to
you
that
our
reading
of
meeker
against
ambassador
oil
leads
us
to
conclude
that
the
intention
of
beacon
theatres
was
rather
broader
than
that.
in
meeker,
there
was
no
mandamus.
the
district
court
did
not
get
the
benefit
of
early
warning
about
the
order
in
which
the
seventh
amendment
preferred
the
issues
to
be
tried
and
the
district
court,
without
the
benefit
of
that,
went
ahead
where
both
legal
and
equitable
relief
was
granted
and
ordered
the
equitable
issues
tried
first
before
a
court
and
without
a
jury.
they
were
tried
first,
adversely
to
the
jury
claimant.
the
district
court
found
that,
in
consequence,
there
was
nothing
to
decide
in
the
legal
action
because
it
was
dependent
on
the
premise
of
fact
which
was
inherent
to
the
equitable
action.
the
case
came
to
the
united
states
supreme
court,
i
believe,
in
1963,
and
this
court
reversed
memorandum,
decision
reversed
citing
beacon
theatres
and
dairy
queen,
remanded
the
case,
and
our
inquiry
tells
us,
as
is
revealed
in
the
brief,
that
the
case
went
back
and
it
was
directed
to
be
retrial
--
retried
with
the
jury
issues
tried
first.
the
order
not
which
by
mandamus
reflects
a
preference
of
this
court
but,
with
the
greatest
respect,
the
order
which
we
believe
justice
black,
for
the
majority
in
beacon,
directed
that
it
be
held
and
that
the
reciprocal
consequence,
far
from
being
a
permitted
estoppel,
is
a
retrial
or
an
assertion
of
the
seventh
amendment
mandate
by
a
new
trial
so
that
the
seventh
amendment,
not
by
happenstance
of
a
court's
improper
ordering
of
issues,
be
vitiated
or
be
lost
in
the
bargain.
and,
to
that
issue
also,
justice
black
in
beacon
theatres,
the
case
argued
to
be
limited
merely
to
a
scheduling
of
cases,
stated
a
jury
right
cannot,
through
prior
determination
of
equitable
claims--
a
jury
right,
forgive
me,
cannot
be
lost
through
prior
determination
of
equitable
claims
except
under
the
most
imperative
circumstances
which,
in
view,
are
flexible
procedures
of
the
federal
rules,
justice
black
couldn't
even
anticipate
happening.
now,
relating
these
arguments
and
relating
these
fulcra
interpretation
of
beacon
theatres
to
the
matter
at
hand,
we
argue,
as
precisely
as
the
fifth
circuit
did
found
in
rachal,
that
what
the
second
circuit
here
has
done
is
a
complete
anomaly
because
in
sec
injunctions,
by
statute,
you
cannot
consolidate
them
with
private
cases.
ergo,
the
issue
cannot
be
presented
to
the
court
in
a
precisely
beacon
theatres
context,
that
is
to
say,
consolidated
cases
presenting
the
question
of
the
order
of
trial
of
legal
and
equitable
issues,
because
these
1934
exchange
act
prohibits
a
jury
trial.
and,
the
fifth
circuit
in
rachal
said
“how
is
it
possible
that
if
these
cases
were
consolidate
for
trial
there
is
no
way
that
the
jury
trial
could
have
had
to
wait
for
the
equitable
trial
or
would've
been
bund
by
a
result
in
an
equitable
trial?"
it
is
anomalous,
the
fifth
circuit
found,
that
the
party
who
was
not
in
the
original
adjudication,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
could,
in
effect,
get
a
benefit
of
a
pre-litigation
without
jury
that
he
could
not
have
had
if
the
case
were
presented
in
the
eq
--
in
the
beacon
theatres'
context.
any
other
interpretation,
i
think,
would
be
--
would
do
the
greatest
offense
to
the
beacon
theatres
and
dairy
queen
doctrines.
now,
your
honors,
we
contend
also
and
the
briefs
demonstrate
the
line
of
reasoning,
i
think,
quite
simply
that
the
traditional
line
of
inquiry
of
whether
a
seventh
amendment
right
concededly
hereto
for
existing
can
be
vitiated
or
lost,
and
that
is
the
standard
historical
inquiry
about
what
the
state
of
the
law
as
to
jury
rights
was
in
1791,
can
be
applied
in
this
instance
that
the
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
demonstrate
the
very
simple
sequence
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
an
estoppel
which
could
have
extinguished
a
jury
trial
right,
not
only
in
1791
but
until
25
or
30
years
ago.
that,
this
action
is
an
action
within
the
protection
of
the
seventh
amendment
cit
--
on
the
authority
of
this
court's
decisions,
and
that
the
introduction
of
a
new
procedural
mechanism
cannot
be
employed
to
vitiate
that
seventh
amendment
right.
if
there
must
be
an
accommodation,
as
justice
black
found
there
must
be
with
the
merger
provisions
of
the
federal
rules,
the
new
procedure
must
accommodate
to
the
seventh
amendment.
