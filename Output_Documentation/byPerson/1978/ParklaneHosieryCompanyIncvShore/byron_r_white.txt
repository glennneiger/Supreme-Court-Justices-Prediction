justice
byron
r.
white
here,
is
it
--
is
the
claim
in
this
case
on
a
collateral
estoppel
that
the
prior
litigation
determines
not
only
the
factual
issues
that
were
raised
and
decided
but
a
legal
issue
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
violation
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
is
a
--
purely
a
factual
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
want
--
so
--
but,
collateral
estoppel
reaches
that
far
at
least,
you
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
historical
facts,
but
some
characterization
of
them
in
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be
preclusions
to
whether
these
particular
statements
had
been
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
--
you
mean
misleading
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
offensive
as
well
as
the
offensive.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
far
do
you
carry
this
particular
role?
what
if
the
--
in
the
sec
action,
the
finding
had
been
in
favor
of
the
company
and
then
you
brought
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there'd
been
findings
in
its
favor
and
on
the
same
issue
in
another
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
that
just
leaves
it
--
it
still
leaves
it
up
to
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
preclude
any
--
you
would
want
to
direct
a
verdict
on
the
particular
facts
in
this
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
in
antitrust
actions
prior
decree
is
remotely
just
prima
facie
but
they
were
buying
it
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
just
said
that
to
mr.
justice
stevens?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
at
that
point,
it
d
--
there
was
no
--
they
would
have
had
to
be
one
that
give
plaintiffs
some
benefits
because
then
there
was
a
mutuality
requirement.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
any
other
instances
under
federal
statutes
where
federal
decrees
are
considered
in
--
to
any
extent
in
private
litigation,
besides
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
reading
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
i'm
wondering,
what
are
their
statutory
provisions
that
call
for
some
kind
of
preclusive
effect,
besides
the
anti
trust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
you
would--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
make
the
same
argument,
i
suppose,
if
there's
an
administrative
agency
determination
that's
been
enforced
in
a
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you--
would
you
suggest
that
it
would
have
to
be
in
a
court
of
law,
the
prior--
the
estopping
judgment
has
to
be
from
a
court
of
law,
not
an
agency,
i
take
it?.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
--
i
take
it
then
you
wouldn't
limit
it
to
a
determination
in
the
court
of
law
at
the
behest
of
an
agency?
it
could
be
a
private
plaintiff
in
the
first
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
somebody
who
doesn't
really
represent
the
shareholders
of
the
public.
