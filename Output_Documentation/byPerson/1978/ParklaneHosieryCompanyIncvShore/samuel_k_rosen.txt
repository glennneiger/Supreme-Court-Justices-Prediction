mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
beacon
theatres
is
precisely
a
scheduling
question.
the
issue
presented
in
beacon
theatres
is
when
the
court
has
before
it
both
legal
and
equitable
claims,
it
must
have
the
jury
decide
the
legal
claims
first.
otherwise,
there
would
be
a
preclusive
effect
of
the
determination
of
the
equitable
claims
by
the
court
which
would
make
it
impossible
for
those
claims
to
be
heard
by
the
jury.
this
is
consistent
with
the
common
law
in
1791
when
the
constitution
--
when
the
seventh
amendment
was
adopted,
in
that
a
decree
in
equity
between
two
parties
in
1791
was
preclusive
on
a
subsequent
legal
action
between
those
two
parties.
there
is
no
anomaly
in
finding
that
the
equitable
action
will
preclude
the
re-litigation
of
the
issues
in
a
legal
action.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
precisely,
your
honor.
there
are
two
--
it's
a
two-horse
parlay
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
that's
correct.
i
think
that
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
i
think
the
blonder-tongue
has
already
been
won.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
i'll
take
whatever
benefits
of
their
victories
i
can,
your
honor.
there
is
no
deprivation
of
a
jury
trial
right
in
this
action.
the
defendants
are
going
to
have
a
jury
trial
in
this
action
on
all
the
issues
not
determined
in
the
sec
action.
they
will
have
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
the
--
in
the
sec
action,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
affirmed
unanimously,
found
that
there
were
material
misstatements
in
the
subject
proxy
statement.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
and
a
violation
of
the
statute,
that's
correct.
collateral
estoppel
being
relating
to
factual
issues,
we
have
moved
for
summary
judgment
only
on
the
factual
issue
that
there
is
a
viola
--
that
there
were
material
misstatements
in
the
proxy
statement.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
it's
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
yes,
but
it
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
yes,
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
but,
even
if
it
doesn't,
the
--
there
would
be
a
preclusion
of
the
re-litigation
of
the
question
of
whether
there
are
material
misstatements
and
omissions
in
the
proxy
statement.
accordingly
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
well,
it's
more
than
that,
your
honor.
it's
the
fact
that
they
are
misleading
and
they
are
--
that
they
are
not
correct.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
yes,
i
mean
misleading
to
the
public
shareholders
of
the
company,
that
they
thought,
for
example,
that
one
of
the
findings
of
misleading
statement
was
that
there
were
no
negotiations
going
on
with
the
federal
reserve
bank
as
to
the
negotiations
to
buy
out
a
lease
hold,
parklane.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
your
honor,
there
had
been
--
there
has
been
an
erosion
of
the
doctrine
of
mutuality.
in
the
second
circuit,
at
least,
in
1964
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
i
would
think
that,
before
blonder-tongue,
that
this
court
did
not
approve
the
mutuality
but
required
mutuality.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
yes,
i
do.
the
blonder-tongue
has
been
followed
in
a
number
of
cases
in
a
number
of
circuits
since
it's
--
since
it
was
decided
in
1970.
it's
been
followed,
for
example,
in
the--
it's
been
followed
and
it's
been
u
--
and
mutuality
has
been
permitted
in
an
of
--
non-mutuality's
been
permitted
in
an
offensive
manner.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
second
circuit,
and
in
the
sixth
circuit,
all
cases
decided
subsequent
to
blonde-tongue
and,
in
fact,
rachal
against
hill,
the
fifth
circuit
case,
was
decided
before
the
blonder-tongue
decision.
so,
it's
not
clear
to
me
how
the
fifth
circuit
would
have
decided
rachal
against
hill
had
blonder-tongue
been
decided
prior
to
its
decision
in
the
rachal
case.
i
think
that
offensive
use
of
collateral
estoppel
should
be
permitted
in
this
case
because,
at
all
times
during
the
pendency
of
the
sec
action,
the
defendants
were
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
private
action,
the
parklaine
and
shore
action,
that
also
differentiates
this
case
from
the
rachal
case
because,
in
rachal,
the
private
action
was
began
after
the
sec
action
was
began.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
they
could
have
sought
to
expedite
the
private
action
instead
of,
for
example,
spending
seventh
months
after
the
complaint
was
filed
to
answer
the
complaint.
the
complaint
was
filed
in
november
of
1974.
the
answer
was,
i
believe,
in
june
of
1975.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
unless
the
private
action
is
ready
for
trial
at
the
time
--
prior
to
the
time
that
the
sec
action
is
brought,
that's
correct.
the
sec
will
--
whichever
case
is
ready
first,
if
the
sec
case
is
ready
first,
the
sec
trial
will
be
held
first.
if
the
private
action
is
ready
first,
it
will
have
its
jury
trial
first.
but,
in
this
case,
the
defendants
had
the
ch
--
they
were
aware
that
the
sec
was
investigating
a
transaction.
at
the
same
time,
they
were
aware
of
the
existence
of
this
action.
if
they
wanted
a
jury
trial
in
this
action,
they
could've
answered
the
complaint
not
in
seven
months,
but
in
two
months
or
whatever
time
they
might
have
been
able
to
get
their
answer
together.
they
could've
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
between
attorneys,
when
i
was
constantly
being
asked
for
three-week
adjournments,
four-week
adjournments
on
the
answer,
it
seemed
to
me,
if
they
want
three
weeks,
they
could
have
three
weeks.
but,
it's
not
i
who's
now
complaining
about
the
loss
of
a
jury
trial.
it's
they
who,
having
taken
the
strategic
moves
that
they
did
in
delaying
answering
and
delaying
depositions,
it's
they
who
are
now
complaining
that
has
caused
them
to
lose
a
jury
trial
right
because
the
sec
case
was
heard
before
this
case.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
well,
under
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel,
we
--
there
would've
been
no
right
to
collateral
estoppel
on
the
part
of
the
company
against
the
plaintiff.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
but
we
would
not
have
had
our
day
in
court.
the
difference
between
that
case
and
the
case
here
presented
is
that
the
company
has
already
had
its
day
in
court.
there's
been
a
full
and
fair
adjudication
of
the
issues.
they
don't
deny
that
there's
been
a
full
and
fair
adjudication
of
the
issues.
there
was
a
four-day
trial.
there
was
an
appeal
in
the
sec
action,
and
the
decision
of
the
judge
was
affirmed
unanimously
by
the
second
circuit.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
if
the
government
loses
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
well,
as
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
the
--
i
believe
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is
to
act
to
protect
the
public.
so
that,
to
the
extent
that
they
win
in
an
action
against
a
private
corp
--
against
the
corporation,
that
the
public
shareholders
ought
to
be
entitled
to
hitch
their
wagon
to
the
star
of
the
sec's
action.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where,
it
seems
to
me
that,
in
the
antitrust
context,
congress
is
limiting
whatever
collateral
estoppel
effect
there
might
be
to
an
antitrust
action
brought
by
the
government
in
the
private
action.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
it
may
have
been
at
the
time
to
give
them
a
benefit
and
to
the
extent
that
it
was
meant
to
give
them
a
benefit.
if
there
were
a
question
that
--
of
--
if
there's
a
question
of
a
violation
of
the
seventh
amendment
in
this
action,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
also
a
question
of
a
violation
of
the
seventh
amendment
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
act
which
renders
prima
facie
effect
to
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
but
if
neither
party
present
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
but
if
neither
party
present
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
may,
by
rendering
prima
facie
effect
to
the
decision
in
the
antitrust
action,
if
neither
side
presents
any
evidence
at
that
point
in
a
private
action
which
is
based
on
a
government
action
brought
against
the
same
defendant,
the
plaintiff
will
win
the
private
action.
whereas,
if
there
were
no
prima
facie
effect
given
to
the
decision
in
the
government
action,
there
would
be
--
the
defendant
would've
won
the
case
since
the
gov
--
the
private
plaintiff
would
not
have
met
his
burden
of
proof.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
just
suggesting
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
doesn't
have
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
it
--
when
congress
passed
the
clayton
act,
the
question
of
mutuality
was
still
a
requirement.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
that
is
my
view,
your
honor,
and
i
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
i
don't
think
so
because
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
thinking
it
through
now,
if
i
may.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
the
statute
may
be
obsolete,
but
it's
still
the
only
congressional
mandate
that
the
court
has
to
follow
in
determining
what
effect,
in
a
private
action,
the
decr
--
the
decision
in
a
government
antitrust
action
should
have.
and,
maybe
that
the
antitrust
action
should
be
treated
differently,
i
don't
know.
but,
it
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
it
would
not
appear
to
apply
to
any
antitrust
actions,
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
because
it's
not
part
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
and
congress,
in
passing
the
securities
and
exchange
act
in
1934
knew
that
it
could've
put
in
such
a
provision,
having
done
it
in
the
clayton
act
in
section
5.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
perhaps
congress
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
perhaps
congress
intends
there
to
be
a
special
rule
for
antitrust
actions.
it
could
be
the
reason.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
and
then
the
reverse
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
right.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
you're
going
to
have
a
problem
whichever
way
the
case
is
decided
because
if
you
decide
for
the
defendant
in
this
action,
the
defendant
will
have
two
bites
at
the
apple.
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
there
will
either
be
two
trials
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
because
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
because
the
plaintiff
would
not
have
had
his
day
in
court,
would
not
have
had
the
chance
to
present
his
witnesses
who
the
sec
might
not
have
called.
there
may
be
facts
which
are
available
to
the
private
party
which
the
--
of
which
the
sec
may
not
have
been
aware.
where,
if
the
--
if
there
is
collateral
estoppel
effect
given
to
the
--
given
against
the
defendant,
he
would've
already
put
his
own
case
on.
he
would've
put
on
all
his
witnesses,
presented
all
the
facts
that
he
could
present,
he
would've
had
his
day
in
court
and
presented
as
full
a
trial
and
as
full
a
record
to
the
court
as
he
would
put
on
in
the
second
case.
that's
the
distinction
between
the
two
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
this
court
has
recognized,
as
recently
as
1966
in
the
katchen
against
landy
case,
that
a
decision
in
an
equity
action
against
one
party
will
have
preclusive
effect
against
that
party
in
a
subsequent
legal
action.
there's
no
--
in
that
case,
in
the
first
action
there
was
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
in
the
second
action,
where
not
for
the
first
action,
there
would've
been
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
that
case
and
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
third
party
who
is
seeking
to
get
the
benefits
of
collateral
estoppel.
since
determinations
at
law
and
equity
were
entitled
to
the
same
respect
in
1791,
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
seventh
amendment,
to
suggest
that
the
modifications
in
the
mutuality
principle
would
be
confined
to
instances
where
jury
determination
was
present
in
the
first
action
would
not
have
been
understood,
i
would
submit,
by
the
courts
in
1791.
the
--
each
of
the
actions,
either
equitable
or
legal,
in
1791
was
treated
with
the
same
degree
of
respect,
and
each
precluded
re-litigation
in
the
second
action,
when
between
the
same
two
parties,
when
mutuality
was
required.
the
erosion
of
the
mutuality
doctrine,
i
submit,
requires
that
the
same
effect
to
equitable
actions
be
granted
--
the
same
preclusive
effect
to
equity
determinations
be
granted
to
legal
actions
whether
or
not
the
same
to
parties
are
present
in
the
action.
i
submit
also
that
there
are
numerous
policy
considerations
which
require
that
decision.
first
is
a
question
of
judicial
economy.
to
have
a
second
trial
on
the
same
issues
by
the
same
defendant
presenting
the
same
facts
will
take
up,
perhaps,
an
enormous
amount
of
time
in
the
federal
courts.
furthermore,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is
a
government
body
acting
for
the
public
shareholder,
and
the
public
shareholders
should
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
any
decision
gotten
by
the
sec
in
its
actions.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
from
my
brief,
your
honor.
i
just
wanted
to
get
the
cite
of
the
case.
i
believe,
under
the
labor
laws
in
whitman
electric
versus
local
363,
international
brotherhood
of
electrical
workers,
398
f.2d
1218,
a
1974
southern
district
case.
i
believe
that
preclusive
effect
was
given
in
the
second
action
to
a
private
company.
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
it's
a
--
that
it's
more
a
common
law
question
which
is
to
be
determined
by
the
courts.looking
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
looking
at
whether
there's
a
full
and
fair
adjudication
in
the
prior
action
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
your
honor,
not
necessarily.
first,
of
course,
that's
not
the
case
that's
before
this
court
but,
secondly,
the
court
would
have
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
agency
--
the
administrative
determination
to
see
whether
there
was
in
fact
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
for
the
defendant
to
present
his
case.
it's
--
we're
not
--
the
courts
have
the
power,
as
this
court
last
year
in
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
--
for
this
case,
this
case
only
has
to
go
as
far
as
to
say
it
must
be
in
a
court
of
law.but,
if
there's
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
in
the
agency,
then
perhaps
the
court
should
grant
collateral
estoppel,
but
the
court
can
look,
as
this
court
did
last
year
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
when
there's
been
a
full
and
fair
adjudication
--
mr.
samuel
k.
rosen
it's
like
the
cases
in
which
there
had
been
the
cases
which
have
approved
the
use
of
--
the
affirmative
use
of
collateral
estoppel,
the
airplane
crash
case,
the
automobile
case,
and
the
mortgage
case
which
were
referred
to
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
when
there
has
been
a
full
and
a
fair
opportunity
in
the
prior
action
regardless
of
whether
the
prior
action
was
to
a
court
or
to
a
jury,
then
there
would
be
collateral
estoppel
effect
given.
this
has
always
been
the
case
with
respect
to
actions
involving
two
parties.
there's
always
been
the
preclusive
effect
of
an
equitable
determination
between
two
parties
in
a
second
action.
the
question
here
is
whether
mutuality,
the
erosion
of
the
doctrine
of
mutuality
should
change
that
rule
when
it
comes
to
deciding
an
action
involving
a
stranger
to
the
first
action.
and,
it
seems
to
us,
that
the
policy
considerations
with
favor
granting
preclusive
effect
in
a
two-party
situation
also
obtained
in
a
three-party
situation.
thank
you,
your
honors.
