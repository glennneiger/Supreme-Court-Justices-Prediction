mr.
levitt,
i'm
sorry
to
go
back
to
justice
stewart's
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
really
not
entirely
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
is
your
answer
that
there's
a
difference
between
defensive
and
offensive
use
of
mutuality
of
estoppel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
said
you
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
should
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
but,
is
it
not
correct
that,
unless
we
draw
that
distinction,
blonder-tongue
decides
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
why
not?
that's
what
you
would
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
only
relevant
to
the
--
where
there's
adequate
motivation
to
go
all
out
and
making
a
complete
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
the
defendant
--
wouldn't
your
client
have
the
same
motivation
to
defend
against
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
than
it
does
in
a
damage
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
rosen,
that's
no
answer
because
if
there's
a
jury
sitting
there
and
the
defendant
wants
to
put
in
evidence,
he
can
do
so.
he's
got
a
right
to
present
the
issue
to
the
jury
in
the
antitrust
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position,
effectively,
it
either
treats
antitrust
cases
differently
than
other
government
litigation
or
else
it
goes
further
than
section
5
of
the
clayton
act
and
says,
instead
of
being
a
prima
facie
effect,
it's
conclusive
effect,
giving
effect
as
he
is
to
add
to
what
congress
granted
to
plaintiffs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
law
has
developed
since
then.
i
mean,
if
the
law
has
developed,
presumably,
all
we've
done
is
made
this
statute
obsolete.
we
don't
need
it
anymore.
the
plaintiffs
don't
need
it.
that
must
be
your
view,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
want
to
say
now
that
the
statute
is
obsolete.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
long
as
that
statute
is
on
the
books,
blonder-tongue
doesn't
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
shouldn't
we
take
it
as
a
legislative
policy
position
with
respect
to
what
prior
government
decrees
generally
should
stand
for
in
later
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
that
section
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know,
that
section
of
the
clayton
act
has
been
amended
three
times
since
the
blonder-tongue
decision,
1974
and
1976
and
19-something
else.
so
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
about
changing
the
prima
facie
factor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
each
of
those
amendments
was
designed
to
help
plaintiffs
in
antitrust
cases
too?
