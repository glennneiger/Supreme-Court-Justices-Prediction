mr.
michael
dyer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
at
bar
results
from
an
automobile
accident,
which
occurred
in
the
state
of
california.
the
driver
of
the
automobile
was
an
employee
of
the
state
of
nevada,
whose
presence
in
california
resulted
from
his
employment
with
the
university
of
nevada.
neither
his
status
as
an
employee
of
the
state
of
nevada
nor
his
status
as
being
in
the
course
of
his
employment
were
contested.
there
had
never
been
an
issue
in
this
case.
when
the
accident
was
initially
filed,
the
state
of
nevada
moved
to
quash
service
of
process
on
the
basis
of
immunity
from
suit.
the
trail
court
granted
that
motion;
it
was
upheld
by
the
california
court
of
appeals.
the
california
supreme
court
in
1973
decision
reported
as
hall
versus
university
of
nevada
reversed
the
california
court
of
appeals,
remanded
the
matter
to
the
trail
court
holding
that
sister
states
who
engage
in
activities
in
the
state
of
california
have
no
immunity
from
suit.
the
state
of
nevada
requested
certiorari.
that
request
was
denied
and
the
matter
was
returned
to
the
superior
court
for
alameda
county,
california.
at
the
beginning
of
the
trail,
the
state
of
nevada
requested
an
order
limiting
any
damages
which
resulted
to
the
statutory
limitation
contained
in
nevada’s
waiver
sovereign
immunity.
that
limitation
being
$25,000
per
individual
or
per
claimant
or
in
the
context
of
this
action
$50,000.
that
motion
was
denied
and
the
jury
returned
to
verdict
of
$1,150,000
as
against
the
state
of
nevada
as
a
named
defendant
in
this
negligence
action.
the
state
of
nevada
appealed
to
the
california
court
of
appeals.
the
california
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
trail
court
verdict
and
the
jury
verdict.
the
california
supreme
court
denied
hearing.
certiorari
was
requested
and
certiorari
issued
to
the
california
court
of
appeals.
in
a
capsule,
the
position
of
the
state
of
nevada
is
that
unconcerning
states
may
not
be
sued
in
any
court
in
this
nation
and
that
where
consent
is
given,
the
terms,
conditions
and
limitations
contained
in
that
consent
must
be
adhered
to
and
that
any
action
tried
must
proceed
according
to
the
terms
and
limitations
of
the
consent.
the
holding
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
is
simply
that
sister
states
have
no
immunity
from
suit
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
michael
dyer
i
would
initially
respond
by
first
pointing
out
that
this
is
not
a
conflicts
case.
despite
urgings
of
petitioners
--
mr.
michael
dyer
the
basic
constitutional
issue
that
this
court
must
reach
is,
does
one
state
have
the
right
to
determine
that
it
may
ignore
the
sovereign
status
of
its
sister
states?
mr.
michael
dyer
the
question
may
it
please
the
court
is,
what
in
the
constitution
would
enable
it?
mr.
michael
dyer
the
states
of
the
union
would
be
free
to
do
so;
they
will
be
free
to
make
that
determination
if
they
are
free
to
treat
each
other
as
independent
nations.
we
urge
that
by
entering
the
constitution,
by
forming
a
union,
a
sisterhood
of
states.
the
states
gave
away
their
ability
to
treat
each
other
as
independent
nations
and
agreed
to
treat
each
other
as
sister
states
at
all
times,
acknowledging
the
status
other
sisters
are
sovereign.
that
limitation
is
found
in
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
the
decisions
of
this
court,
which
have
held
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
apart
from
requiring
full
faith
and
credit
be
given
the
judgments
stood
for
the
additional
principle
and
i
think
perhaps
more
important
principle
of
unifying
the
states
of
union.
mr.
michael
dyer
we
are
not
asking
for
an
extra
territorial
effect
in
nevada
law.
our
position
in
a
nutshell
is
that
any
state
must
acknowledge
the
status
of
our
sister
states
as
a
sovereign.
mr.
michael
dyer
the
constitution,
and
i'm
trying
to
ask
the
question
mr.
chief
justice
and
i'm
not
trying
to
side
step,
but
i
want
to
address
this
question,
because
i
think
it
is
perhaps
the
most
important
--
mr.
michael
dyer
i
think
that
what
the
court
must
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
constitution
is
a
document
by
which
the
states
granted
limited
powers
to
the
federal
government
and
agreed
upon
their
relationship
with
their
sister
states.
the
tenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
provided
that
all
powers
not
granted
or
surrendered
in
the
constitution
would
be
retained
to
the
states.
mr.
michael
dyer
the
founding
fathers
thought
that
it
was.
the
court
in
chisholm
versus
georgia
felt
that
it
wasn't.
mr.
michael
dyer
one
of
the
specific
powers
granted
in
the
constitution
was
the
--
or
one
of
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
surrendered
was
the
ability
of
a
state
to
be
sued
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
that
consent
is
specified
in
the
constitution,
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
the
states
agree
to
be
sued
in
the
trial
court
and
negligence
actions
in
the
trail
courts
of
the
sister
states.
at
the
time
of
the
formation
of
the
constitution,
all
the
founding
fathers
felt
that
the
states
had
the
power
to
be
immune
from
suit.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
case
had
been
decided
recently
before
that
in
one
u.s
was
the
case
of
nathan
v.
bradford,
i
believe
is
the
correct
citation.
that
case
involved
the
state
of
pennsylvania
attempting
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
sister
state.
this
was
some
two
or
three
months
before
the
constitutional
convention
and
the
case
was
dismissed
on
the
holding
that
no
state
may
assert
jurisdiction
over
any
other
state.
mr.
michael
dyer
it
did
not
give
up
the
authority
to
adjudicate
claims
over
other
states,
if
in
fact
it
has
a
right
to
treat
other
states
as
independent
nations.
it
did
give
up
the
right
to
treat
other
states
independent
nations.
nowhere
in
the
constitution
does
it
say
that
state
of
california
may
not
sue
the
united
states
government
if
one
of
their
employees
is
involved
in
a
motor
vehicle
accident.
and
yet
the
tort
claims
immunity
or
the
immunity
to
federal
government,
i
think
would
go
unquestioned.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
the
states
have
the
right
to
do
that
–-
mr.
michael
dyer
well,
that
would
be
correct,
but
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
a
state
has
authority
to
call
her
sister
states
to
bar,
in
the
very
words
of
this
court
and
i
am
quoting
from
cunningham
versus
macon
&
brunswick
railroad,
it
is
109
u.
s.
446.
these
are
the
words
of
the
court;
it
may
be
accepted
as
a
point
of
departure
unquestioned
that
neither
a
state
nor
the
united
states
can
be
sued
as
defendant
in
any
court
in
this
country
without
their
consent.
this
position
is
being
consistently
followed,
it
was
early
enunciated
the
axiom
that
the
sovereign
at
that,
excuse
me
that
a
sovereign
and
the
court
has
consistently
used
the
term
a
sovereign,
may
not
be
sued
in
any
court
has
been
consistently
followed.
it
was
initially
stated
in
the
case
of
beers
versus
arkansas
in
1857.
it
has
been
followed
in
hans
versus
louisiana,
ex
parte
young,
parden
v.
terminal
railway,
edelman
versus
jordan
even
alludes
the
immunity
of
states
from
suit.
mr.
michael
dyer
if
the
contract
initially
of
course
--
mr.
michael
dyer
yes,
i
think
they
could
be
sued
in
that
context.
and
i
think
they
could
be
sued
perhaps
even
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
because
we
are
then
dealing
with
rights
and
obligations
created
on
the
laws
of
another
state
which
the
state
knowingly
entered
into
and
intentionally
entered
into
whereas
the
state
of
nevada
at
that
point
would
have
intentionally
and
knowingly
entered
into
an
agreement
in
california.
mr.
michael
dyer
a
contractual
relationship
and
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
perhaps
there
may
be
a
distinction
as
the
court
has
noted
between
tort
actions
of
the
negligence
character,
non-intentional
torts
and
other
forms
of
actions.
for
instance,
many
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
california
supreme
court
dealt
with
the
question
or
dealt
with
the
ownership
of
land
in
one
state
and
the
attempt
to
claim
that
one
state
owning
land
in
a
sister
state
and
the
land
owning
state
trying
to
claim
that
they
were
exempt
from
taxation
laws.
and
the
holding
of
that
entire
line
of
cases
is
of
course
is
that
when
a
state
leaves
the
area,
which
is
normally
the
operation
of
the
state.
and
enters
into
other
functions,
at
that
point,
they
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
terms
of
the
area
which
they
have
entered,
that
is
when
they
enter
into
a
proprietary
situation
they
agree
to
be
bound
as
any
other
proprietary.
mr.
michael
dyer
perhaps
the
most
leading
--
mr.
michael
dyer
perhaps
the
most
leading
case
and
that
is
kennecott
copper
and
it
held
in
language
that
very
analogist
to
nevada
statutory
waiver
that
when
a
state
had
stated
that
we
waive
our
immunity
and
we
will
be
sued
in
any
court;
that
any
court
did
not
mean
any
court.
specifically
it
do
not
mean
federal
courts.
in
any
court
of
that
state
and
as
the
court
as
pointed
out,
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
any
waiver
of
immunity
be
made
specifically.
and
i
would
urge
that
it
also
be
made
knowingly.
and
that
is
perhaps
the
distinction,
because
and
i
know
this
court
hears
us
more
than
we
wish.
mr.
michael
dyer
i
believe
the
court
has
misinterpreted
my
statement.
i
said
that
--
mr.
michael
dyer
well,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
you
may
have
misinterpreted
my
statement,
because
what
i
meant
to
reply
for
you
talking
about
my
response
to
mr.
justice
steven's
question,
when
the
state
enters
into
an
area
that
is
when
the
state
engages
in
inter-state
commerce
as
a
common
carrier
where
authority
to
regulate
has
been
specifically
delegated
in
entering
into
a
proprietary
function,
then
perhaps
you'll
say
that
knowingly,
knowingly
--
mr.
michael
dyer
no,
our
position
is
that
mr.
bam
who
was
the
driver
of
the
car
was
routinely
engaged
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
with
the
university
of
nevada;
that
in
the
course
of
those
duties,
he
was
requested
to
go
into
the
state
of
california
to
pick
up
some
parts,
some
television
parts
for
the
university
of
nevada
and
that
he
was
involved
in
an
automobile
accident.
now
based
upon
that,
the
california
courts
have
held
that
the
state
of
nevada
consented
to
be
sued
in
unlimited
liability.
if
the
state
of
nevada
consented
to
be
sued
in
any
manner,
we
urge
that
we
consented
by
our
statutory
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
that
when
we
waived
immunity
by
nrs:
chapter
41
and
said
we
agreed
to
have
our
liability
adjudicated
in
the
same
manner
as
private
parties.
mr.
michael
dyer
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
statement
--
mr.
michael
dyer
i
believe
that
is
the
only
nevada
statute
drawn
and
issued.
mr.
michael
dyer
no,
that's
not
correct;
we
also
relied
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
as
i
stated
earlier,
because
it's
our
understanding
that
full
faith
and
credit
clause
that,
that
clause
in
addition
to
requiring,
the
judgments
acquired
in
one
state
be
given
effect
to
another.
unify
the
states
and
substituted
a
command
for
the
principles
of
comity
that
is,
the
clause
abrogated
the
states'
rights
to
treat
each
others
independent
nations.
mr.
michael
dyer
that
is
the
entire
language
of
the
clause.
mr.
michael
dyer
this
case,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
was
to
alter
the
status
of
the
individual
states'
as
independent
foreign
sovereignties.
each
free
to
ignore
the
rights
and
proceedings
of
the
other
and
to
make
each
an
integral
part
of
a
single
nation.
now,
so
many
cases
along
those
lines
are
of
shea
v.
shea
or
of
united
commercial
travelers
--
mr.
michael
dyer
i
think
that
in
addition,
an
important
concept
that
we
are
dealing
with
is
union,
sisterhood.
union
can
only
work
among
individual
states
who
under
the
tenth
amendment
have
retained
all
their
rights,
which
they
had
at
the
time
--
mr.
michael
dyer
if
we
didn't
have
our
immunity
limitation,
we
would
most
likely
be
asserting
that
we
could
not
be
sued
under
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
and
of
itself
because
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
mr.
michael
dyer
because
the
full
faith.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
dyer
immunity,
sovereign
immunity
as
we
know
it
in
the
english
system
of
jurisprudence
does
not
require
a
holding
by
the
courts
that
exist.
it
cannot
be
conveyed
by
the
citizens
to
the
sovereign,
it
arises
from
the
very
nature
of
sovereignty.
mr.
michael
dyer
that's
correct.
we
would
not
be
able
to
make
that
argument,
but
--
mr.
michael
dyer
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
declared
to
be
invalid
by
judicial
interpretation
or
whether
legislature
waived
it,
except
for
one.
and
that
is,
that
when
the
legislature
waived
sovereign
immunity,
they
placed
a
condition
on
it.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
if
there
is
a
condition
placed
upon
the
waiver
that
condition
has
to
be
given
effect.
in
essence,
our
argument
is
if
california
attained
jurisdiction
over
us,
by
our
own
waiver,
they
must
apply
their
limitation
contained
in
that
waiver.
if
in
fact,
we
had
totally
abrogated
sovereign
immunity,
if
in
fact,
the
nevada
supreme
court
had
held
that
the
doctrine
had
no
viability
for
the
state
of
nevada.
we
cannot
argue
that
california
cannot
attain
jurisdiction
over
us
as
any
other
tortfeasor,
but
at
that
point
it
would
have
been
the
nevada
supreme
court
or
the
nevada
legislature
that
made
that
determination.
mr.
michael
dyer
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice,
it's
assuming
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
had
upheld
the
principle
of
sovereign
immunity
in
total?
mr.
michael
dyer
and
there
had
been
no
waiver
by
the
legislature.
mr.
michael
dyer
we
would
at
that
time
urge
that
the
state
of
california
must
acknowledge
our
status
as
a
sovereign
and
our
determination
that
as
a
sovereign,
we
still
retain
sovereign
immunity,
it's
the
status
question
that's
i
think
is
very
important
in
this
case
and
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
that
there
at
least
in
our
mind
is
a
great
distinction
between
the
status
of
a
state
as
a
sovereign
and
the
ability
to
exercise
sovereign
power.
we
are
not
contending
that
we
have
the
right
to
legislate
the
california
citizens.
we
are
not
contending
that
we
have
the
right
to
say
that
our
laws
have
to
be
given
extra
territorial
effect.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
california
as
any
state,
any
state
must
recognize
our
status
as
a
sovereign
that
is
that
we
have
a
sovereign
status
and
that
one
of
the
attributes
of
that
status
is
immunity
and
once
they
recognize
our
status,
they
must
recognize
our
immunity.
and
if
they
obtain
jurisdiction
over
it,
it
must
be
pursuant
to
our
consent,
which
in
this
could
have
only
been
given
by
our
statutory
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
they
have
got
to
give
effect
to
the
limitation
contained
in
the
statutory
waiver.
mr.
michael
dyer
in
this
particular
case,
california
would
collect
it
by
executing
on
our
tax
accounts,
which
we
maintain
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
michael
dyer
that's
exactly
right,
the
only
reason
that
we
have
property
in
state
of
california,
i
think
this
is
important.
actually
there
are
two
reasons.
one
is
because,
we
are
a
small
state.
the
state
of
nevada
has
600,000
people;
most
of
our
major
businesses
are
headquartered
in
our
neighboring
state
of
california.
those
businesses
don't
even
maintain
large
bank
accounts
in
nevada
and
rather
they
desire
to
collect
their
sales
tax
as
it
comes
in
and
when
they
have
to
pay
it
on
a
quarterly
basis,
they
pay
it
on
a
bank
draft
out
of
state
of
california.
so,
because
of
the
size
of
the
state
of
nevada,
because
of
our
dependence
in
the
modern
business
world
upon
tax
revenues
coming
in
from
accounts
that
our
businesses
wish
to
maintain
in
another
state.
the
other
state
has
ability
to
execute
against
those
accounts
and
we
don't
have
the
ability
to
rely
upon
our
own
courts
to
protect
us.
but
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
if
in
fact
the
respondent's
position
is
correct,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
whether
we
had
the
right
protect
ourselves,
because
under
the
respondents'
version
of
the
case,
we
can
be
sued
as
any
other
person
in
the
state
of
california
and
when
we
are
sued,
we
are
subject
to
unlimited
liability
and
under
their
theory,
we
would
be
required
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
california
judgment
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
it
is
unequivocally
opposed
to
our
state
policy.
mr.
michael
dyer
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that
statement,
but
i'm
saying
that
i
think
respondents
urged
the
opposite.
again,
we
are
back
to
the
key
issue
in
the
case
and
that's
consent.
does
one
state
have
to
consent
to
be
sued
by
her
sister
states
or
can
the
state
simply
treat
other
in
any
manner
which
they
choose.
if
they
were
independent
nations
under
the
recent
developments
in
the
law
of
independent
nations
they
could
do
just
that.
mr.
michael
dyer
initially,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
that
if
this
were
a
willful,
wonton
and
malicious
tort,
it
would
not
be
in
the
course
of
the
employee's
employment.
and
i
can't
conceive
of
any
such
tort,
which
the
state
of
nevada
could
be
sued
as
defendant
under
the
doctrine
of
respondent's
superior
on
that
basis,
but
if
in
fact
it
were
a
willful,
wonton
malicious
tort,
i
don't
think
that
fact
should
be
determined
to
it.
if
in
fact,
the
state
of
nevada
could
be
sued
in
that
theory
--
mr.
michael
dyer
that
would
be
incorrect.
mr.
michael
dyer
well,
that
would
be
correct,
but
i
might
also
point
out
that
speaking
of
the
state
militia,
each
year
when
the
state
of
nevada
national
guard
goes
to
summer
camp,
we
don't
have
any
army
basis
in
our
state.
our
national
guard
has
to
go
out
to
other
states,
to
washington;
to
california
we
take
all
of
our
heavy
equipment,
our
tanks.
mr.
michael
dyer
well,
what
happens
if
one
of
those
tanks
runs
into
an
automobile?
mr.
michael
dyer
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
dyer
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
is
that
if
we
sent
our
militia,
the
state
of
nevada
sent
our
militia
or
our
national
guard,
in
the
state
of
california
to
seize
property
that
would
be
an
act
against
a
state
of
the
union.
albeit,
immediately
affecting
a
private
land
owner,
it
would
be
an
act
against
the
sovereignty
of
a
sister
state
and
it
would
first
of
all
be
cognizable
in
this
court
under
the
original
jurisdiction,
it
would
in
fact
be
an
act
of
war.
mr.
michael
dyer
if
in
fact
we
direct
our
employees
to
go
in
and
commit
an
intentional
tort
and
we
have
not
waived
sovereign
immunity,
it
would
be
our
position
that
--
mr.
michael
dyer
it
would
be
our
position
that
california
would
be
required
to
recognize
our
sovereignty
that
any
rights
that
they
might
have
would
be
--
had
to
be
taken
by
the
state
of
the
california
under
the
parens
patriae
doctrine
on
behalf
of
their
citizens
against
us
in
this
court.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
want
to
reserve
the
remaining
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
dyer
the
essence
of
our
position
today
is
that
at
the
time
of
this
action,
our
waiver
was
intended
to
be
limited
to
courts
of
the
state
of
nevada,
but
if
the
court
should
construe
otherwise
as
the
result
of
the
language
--
mr.
michael
dyer
our
initial
position
is
that
statutory
waiver
under
the
kennecott
decision
did
not
constitute
jurisdiction
or
excuse
me
waiver
of
immunity
in
other
states
but
simply
in
our
own
courts.
mr.
michael
dyer
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
michael
dyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
dyer
quite
a
part
from
that,
that's
our
initial
position.
mr.
michael
dyer
just
a
few
comments
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
our
indemnification
clause
was
added
by
the
1977
legislature,
prior
to
that
the
only
amount
of
indemnification
that
would
have
been
received
would
be
been
under
a
special
act
of
the
legislature
and
even
under
our
present
indemnification
it
is
limited
to
our
liability
limitation.
i
think
the
reason
that
the
state
of
nevada
was
sued
is
obvious;
it
was
because
of
the
deep
pocket
theory.
with
respect
to
paulus,
we
did
not
cite
paulus
because
we
do
not
view
this
case
as
a
conflicts
case.
we
feel
it
becomes
a
conflicts
case
only
if
you
first
determine
that
we
can
be
sued
without
our
consent,
because
if
you
determine
that
we
have
to
have
consented
the
suit,
then
it
must
go
off
on
our
limitation.
if
we
can
be
sued
without
our
consent,
at
that
time
it
becomes
a
balancing
of
governmental
interest,
but
i
would
point
to
the
court
that
even
in
that
situation,
we
have
provided
for
california's
interest
to
be
protected
by
allowing
recovery
up
to
a
specified
limitation
and
i
might
also
add
that
there
was
insurance
on
the
automobile
that
was
being
driven
in
california.
i
think
the
judgment
has
already
been
satisfied
to
the
extent
of
$110,000
or
something
like
that.
turner
v.
staggs
which
was
cited
by
respondent's
stands
for
the
proposition
or
overrule
of
the
requirement
in
nevada
that
one
had
to
first
file
a
claim
with
a
nevada
secretary
of
state
within
six
months
of
the
action
in
order
to
maintain
a
preceding
against
the
state
of
nevada.
it
overruled
nrs:41-039
which
is
one
of
9
specific
statutory
sections
dealing
with
our
statutory
limitations,
it
simply
stands
for
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
have
a
situation
where
private
tortfeasors
can
sue
without
filing
a
claim
and
public
tortfeasors
are
people
who
are
torted
by
the
public,
by
the
government
must
first
file
a
claim
within
six
months
after
the
accident
happens.
who
knows
what
the
answer
would
have
been
if
the
statute
of
limitations
had
been
in
the
time
for
filing
the
claim,
but
turner
v.
staggs
did
not
reach
a
question
about
limitation
on
liability.
and
does
not
stand
for
the
public
policy
that
all
tort
victims
should
be
treated
the
same.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
has
been
reiterated
in
the
state
case
of
calio
versus
state,
which
i
do
not
have
a
citation
for
and
i
apologize,
but
calio
versus
state
is
a
1977
case
that
came
down
prior
to
this
decision
and
i
thank
the
court
for
your
time.
