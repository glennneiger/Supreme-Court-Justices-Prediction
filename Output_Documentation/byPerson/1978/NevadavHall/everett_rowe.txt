mr.
everett
rowe
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
a
little
difficulty
in
understanding
petitioner's
position,
but
i
thought
what
i
should
do
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
is
to
go
through
what
i
think
is
not
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
then
get
to
what
i
think
are
really
the
issues
that
are
involved
--
i
think
first
of
all.
mr.
everett
rowe
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
we
could
have
by
a
reason
of
this
fact
and
this
is
one
of
the
theories
that
we
have
set
forth
in
the
brief
that
we
feel
that
a
sovereignty
of
the
state,
its
sovereign
powers
are
co-extensive
with
the
geographical
limitations
of
that
state
and
then
when
that
state
goes
outside
of
its
state
and
entertains
and
engages
in
activities
in
another
sovereign
state.
in
this
case
california,
where
the
california
sovereignty
is
supreme,
that
they
do
not
bring
with
them
the
prerogatives
of
a
sovereign
that
nevada
when
they
come
in
under
those
circumstances
operate
an
automobile
on
the
california
highway
do
not
have
the
prerogatives
of
a
sovereign
and
that
therefore
they
do
not
have
this
attribute
as
he
quotes,
“the
attribute
of
immunity”.
mr.
everett
rowe
that's
his
argument,
we
don't
accept
that
argument,
but
we
feel
that
if
the
argument
has
any
basis
at
all
that
our
state
courts
would
still
have
their
constitutional
power
of
choice
of
law
and
similar
to
the
pearson
case,
which
he
cited
as
authority,
which
is
really
directly
opposite
to
his
view
in
the
pearson
case,
the
new
york
case,
they
discussed
that
state
has
a
choice
of
constitutional
right
of
choice
of
law
and
that
they
may
choose
certain
portions
of
a
statute
and
reject
others
in
that
case,
they
rejected
the
massachusetts
limitation
of
$15,000
on
recovery
for
debt
action,
and
they
took
other
portions
of
this
statute.
that
is
our
position
here
that
the
constitutional
right
of
choice
of
law
of
the
state
of
california
would
allow
them
to
reject,
if
you
accepted
his
argument
that
this
is
required,
would
allow
california
to
reject
the
monitory
limitation.
mr.
everett
rowe
no,
i
think
that
under
the
present
law,
as
i
have
been
reading
these
law
reviews
on
both
sides
and
i
have
been
following
the
arguments,
which
is
a
very
important
constitutional
debate
that
is
going
on
before
this
court
now
with
reference
to
the
eleventh
amendment
and
article
iv
of
the
constitution.
it
would
appear
that
the
federal
court
would
be
precluded
from
taking
jurisdiction.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
i
think
it's
a
problem
that
has
arisen
by
reason
of
the
passage
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
problems
that
the
courts
have
had
in
dealing
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
here
we
are
not
seeking
to
federal
jurisdiction
here
this
--
i
think
it
is
a
different
case,
because
this
state
of
nevada
is
coming
into
california
outside
of
its
own
sovereign
jurisdiction
and
is
operating
an
automobile
picking
up
television
parts.
mr.
everett
rowe
it
could
be
absent
--
any
restrictions
in
the
constitution
to
entertain
jurisdiction.
mr.
everett
rowe
of
course
picking
up
television
parts
as
-–
mr.
everett
rowe
for
a
purpose
of
university
or
school,
i
think
most
cases
have
held
that
i
won't
call
it
a
sovereign
activity,
i
will
call
it;
it
could
be
a
governmental
function.
usually
education
has
been
deemed
to
be
--
an
educational
function
is
governmental
in
nature.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
i
would
make
the
distinction
because
i
don't
think
that
when
nevada
is
in
california,
when
it
is
outside
of
that
area
where
there
is
a
relationship
between
governed
and
governor,
that
they
actually
are
in
the
nature
of
a
sovereign.
mr.
everett
rowe
correct
and
are
of
course
precedent
for
that
in
other
aspects
of
case
mainly
not
dealing
with
motor
vehicle
accident
cases,
but
dealing
with
property
exemption
from
taxation.
there
is
the
minnesota
case
that
i
have
cited
in
the
brief,
state
versus
hudson
where
the
state
–-
and
this
was
a
governmental
function,
it
was
in
one
case
a
toll
bridge,
which
was
being
operated
for
the
highway
system,
which
certainly
could
be
a
governmental
function.
and
they
claimed
that
they
should
be
exempt
from
taxation,
because
it
was
a
governmental
function,
however
that
relief
was
denied,
they
say
that
when
that
state
came
into
the
other
state
and
was
present
there,
then
they
are
no
longer
--
they
lose
the
cloak
of
sovereignty,
and
they
are
to
be
treated
as
any
other
person
within
that
state.
so,
i
think
that
is
our
analysis
of
the
situation.
mr.
everett
rowe
i
could
find
none.
mr.
everett
rowe
they
cited
that
--
the
district
court
of
appeals
cited
against
me,
but
i
always
thought
that
the
case
actually
was
in
my
favor,
because
it
actually
gave
the
right
of
choice
of
law
in
that
particular
case
that
dealt
with
an
anchor
workman's
compensation
claim.
the
district
court
of
appeal
took
great
delight
in
citing
that
case
against
me
even
though
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
argue
against
it
at
that
time,
because
it
was
really
submitted
without
too
much
oral
argument
and
the
court
didn't
even
ask
me
about
the
case
at
that
time.
no,
i
think
the
paulus
case
is
indicative
of
the
line
of
argument
that
i
have
regarding
constitutional
right
of
the
state
of
california
and
its
choice
of
law.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
i
didn't
think
it
was
entirely
on
point,
because
it
was
one
of
those
cases
involving
workman's
compensation
laws
and
you
have
the
alaska
packers
case
and
the
others.
mr.
everett
rowe
no,
he
doesn't
though
i
won't
think
he
would.
although
the
court
relied
on
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that's
why
i
had
a
petition
for
a
hearing
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california.
another
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
–-
mr.
everett
rowe
correct.
mr.
everett
rowe
no,
i
don't
think
it
really
does,
because
i
can
see
if
the
x
--
mr.
everett
rowe
pardon
me.
mr.
everett
rowe
if
the
accident
had
happened
in
nevada
and
we
had
california
residence.
mr.
everett
rowe
right.
mr.
everett
rowe
i
think
--
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
the
moon,
because
this
young
boy
suffered
severe
brain
damage
and
is
retarded
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
i
would
like
--
i'm
not
even
sure
that
today
what
nevada's
position
is
and
i
duly
-–
mr.
everett
rowe
they
have
done
away
with
--
mr.
everett
rowe
but
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
case
that
i
mailed
the
letter
to
the
court
about
the
turner
versus
stags
case.
and,
if
one
can
really
see
any
implicit
basic
policy
that
the
state
of
nevada
now
has.
it
seems
that
they
interpreted
their
statute
to
have
a
purpose
of
putting
governmental
tortfeasors
and
non-governmental
tortfeasors
on
the
same
footing
as
the
language
of
the
supreme
court
of
nevada.
they
threw
out
their
claim
statute,
they
didn't
throw
out
specifically
the
limitation
on
damages,
but
they
threw
out
the
claim
statute,
the
requirements
filing
a
claim,
and
the
basis
for
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
doing
that
was
they
said
that
it
is
not
a
reasonable
classification
to
--
between
government
--
to
make
a
distinction
between
government
tortfeasors
and
non-government
tortfeasors.
to
make
a
distinction
between
victims
of
government
torts
and
victims
of
non-government
torts.
now,
that's
their
policy
and
in
a
brief
filed
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
in
that
case
of
turner,
the
attorney
for
the
--
representing
the
interest
of
the
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
nevada
in
his
brief,
in
his
petition
for
certiorari
and
that
was
73-489
where
this
court
denied
certiorari.
they
argued
from
page
eight
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
case
right
in
out
of
the
tuner
case.
more
importantly
however,
the
constitutional
rationale
employed
below
that's
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
nevada
draws
into
serious
question,
the
constitutionality
of
the
related
statutes
aimed
limiting
actions
against
the
state
and
its
political
subdivision.
should
private
and
governmental
tortfeasors
be
unconditionally
placed
on
equal
footing
as
determined
by
the
court
by
the
supreme
court
of
nevada.
statute
setting
recovery
limits,
prohibiting
punitive
damage
or
exempting
from
liability
actions
by
the
state
militia
would
for
the
same
reason
necessarily
be
found
to
be
repugnant
to
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
everett
rowe
no,
i
think
the
basis
of
their
opinion
is
the
basis
that
i'm
arguing
here.
mr.
everett
rowe
i
was
going
to
use
that
particular
case
in
oral
argument,
yes.
it
wasn't
delivered.
mr.
everett
rowe
yeah,
i
had
it
delivered
to
the
court
through
federal
express
from
santa
fe.
mr.
everett
rowe
yeah,
well
he
either
loses
his
job,
but
i
relied
upon
them,
and
they
were
supposed
to
have
sent
it.
it
was
just
a
letter
that
i
was
going
to
refer
to
the
case
and
i
can
cite
it
to
you
again.
i
sent
a
copy
to
counsel,
turner
versus
stag
--
which
--
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
opinion.
mr.
everett
rowe
i'll
get
it
for
you
here.
that's
turner
versus
staggs,
510
p.
2d.
879.
certiorari
denied
414
u.s.
1079.
mr.
everett
rowe
right.
and
that
case
held
that
the
stated
object
of
the
nevada
legislation,
which
was
43-031
that
is
their
basic
liability
tort
claim
section,
was
to
put
governmental
units
on
equal
footing
with
private
tortfeasors.
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
adopting
language
from
reich
versus
state
highway
department
a
michigan
case;
stated
that
this
diverse
treatment
of
members
of
a
class
along
the
lines
of
governmental
or
private
tortfeasors
bears
no
reasonable
relationship
under
today's
circumstances
to
the
recognized
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
actually
it
started
in
san
francisco
with
the
administrator
being
appointed
in
san
francisco
of
the
deceased
employee.
then
they
raised
questions
concerning
the
administrator
so
it
was
then
in
placer
county.
and
under
the
nevada
statute,
their
venue
statute
says
that
the
action
may
be
commenced
in
the
county
where
the
accident
occurred
and
the
--
mr.
everett
rowe
yes,
yes
it
does
and
then
on
the
appendix.
mr.
everett
rowe
no,
there
is
a
sub-division
two,
it's
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
the
nevada
statute
says
that
the
action
has
to
be
instituted
in
the
county
in
which
the
accident
happened
not
in
the
--
mr.
everett
rowe
even
though
it
is
against
the
state,
it
is
their
own
provision.
mr.
everett
rowe
i
wasn't
--
we
were
not
bound
by
it,
but
the
case
was
in
the
county
in
which
the
accident
happened
until
we
got
a
change
of
venue
based
upon
the
convenience
of
witnesses
to
alameda
county.
mr.
everett
rowe
pardon.
mr.
everett
rowe
oakland.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
i
don't
know
if
there
is
been
any
statistical
study
of
that
but
--
mr.
everett
rowe
i
would
think,
now
the
basis
for
the
move
and
it
was
very
well
documented
was
by
reason
of
convenience
of
witness,
because
all
of
the
doctors
and
witnesses
treating
this
brain
damaged
child
were
in
the
bay
area
and
for
that
reason
rather
than
having
them
all
come
from
oakland,
san
francisco
and
that
area
to
placer
county
and
auburn,
the
court
thought
that
the
venue
change
should
be
granted.
there
is
another
question
concerning
the
--
that
the
court
is
raised
--
i
was
going
to
start
at
my
very
beginning
before
i
--
to
try
to
talk
about
what
is
not
involved.
i
don't
feel
that
there
is
any
real
constitutional
issue
involved
in
this
case.
we
don't
have
a
legislative
power
of
congress
to
impose
suability
against
states
involved
here,
which
has
been
a
question
before
this
court
and
which
has
caused
a
great
deal
of
law
review
articles
and
interests
throughout
the
nation.
and
we
don't
have
the
question
of
the
amenability
of
the
federal
government
to
suits
by
states
that
was
raised
as
a
specter
by
petitioner
saying
that
california,
if
this
case
was
upheld
would
then
be
suing
the
united
states
government,
because
we
do
have
a
supremacy
cause
of
the
united
states
constitution
article
vi
section
1
and
2.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
are
involved
here
and
it's
not
involved
in
this
case,
the
question
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
federal
courts
vis-à-vis
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
many
cases
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
which
surround
that
particular
issue.
what
we
think
is
involved
is
basically
a
full
faith
and
credit
question
at
most
as
raised
by
the
other
side.
but
i
think
under
if
you
even
assume
that
to
be
an
issue,
the
place
of
the
tort
was
state
of
california.
the
forum,
the
law
of
a
forum
was
california,
so
we
don't
have
the
problem
of
selecting
between
the
forum
and
the
place
of
the
tort,
because
they
are
one
in
the
same.
we
don't
see
any
state
of
california,
we
feel
as
the
constitutional
power
as
i
pointed
out
developed
their
own
conflictive
laws
doctrine.
and
that
was
cited
in
the
pearson
case,
which
was
relied
on
by
counsel
or
petitioner.
i
think
what
he
did
is
he
read
the
old
opinion
that
was
later
then
reversed
and
then
judge
kauffmann
wrote
with
the
i
think
five
other
judges
assenting
with
him,
a
new
opinion,
but
i
think
petitioner
misquoted
the
case
saying
that
we
could
not
base
the
obligation
upon
a
foreign
statute
and
then
only
take
parts
of
it,
because
that
was
precisely
the
hearing
and
the
holding
on
pearson.
they
said
the
state
under
its
constitutional
power
of
choice
of
law
had
the
right
to
reject
the
massachusetts
limitation
of
damages
which
was
$15,000.
so,
we
think
that
refusal
to
apply
the
limitation
on
recovery
is
an
exercise
of
that
constitutional
right.
and
as
i
have
discussed
before,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
compelling
state
interest
demonstrated
by
nevada
to
require
california
to
apply
its
laws,
because
one
of
the
turner
versus
staggs
case
which
certainly
puts
a
serious
question
on
the
policy
of
the
state
of
nevada
with
regard
to
treatment
of
governmental
tortfeasors
and
victims
of
governmental
torts.
and
also
the
nevada
constitutional
article
iv
section
22
does
waive
the
immunity;
it
authorizes
the
legislature
to
enact
laws
to
allow
them
to
be
sued.
so,
i
don't
think
that
he
can
really
argue
the
fact
that
this
problem
of
sovereign
immunity,
because
of
the
waiver
in
the
constitution.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
basis
of
affirming,
i
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
did
not
discuss
nevada
policy.
you
are
correct.
it
based
its
opinion
upon
the
fact,
the
theory
that
the
territory
that
the
action
of
nevada
outside
of
its
own
territories
involved
in
motor
vehicle
accidents.
driving
a
motor
vehicle
on
the
california
state
highways
gave
the
california
court
sufficient
jurisdiction
under
their
long-arm
statute.
and
there
are
other
cases
of
course
that
have
held
that
in
the
--
with
reference
to
the
statutes
which
of
course
this
court
is
familiar
with
would
say
that
the
state
certainly
has
that
under
its
police
power
the
right
to
enact
such
a
statute.
and,
i
think
that
one
of
the
questions
of
the
justice's
was,
“well
did
this
man
knowingly
come
in,
he
was
directed
to
drive
into
california”.
nevada
knew
of
the
statutes
of
california,
which
operation
of
a
motor
vehicle
on
their
highways
constituted
an
appointment
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
being
a
person
who
could
be
served
with
process
against
the
defendant.
mr.
everett
rowe
i
think
we
could
have
because
of
my
theory
that
when
--
and
the
theory
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
that
when
nevada
came
into
california
and
conducted
operations
in
the
state
of
california,
they
no
longer
had
the
protection
or
the
status
of
a
sovereign.
and
without
the
status
of
a
sovereign,
they
cannot
then
raise
the
concept
of
sovereign
immunity,
since
only
a
sovereign
can
--
mr.
everett
rowe
well
–-
mr.
everett
rowe
we
are
talking
about
today
and
i
think
that
the
cases
that
i've
cited
in
the
brief
which
discussed
that.
mr.
everett
rowe
right
and
they
drive
into
california.
mr.
everett
rowe
my
theory
–
mr.
everett
rowe
they
came
into
california
once
they
came
into
california.
mr.
everett
rowe
they
didn't
even
have
a
status
as
a
sovereign
and
therefore
they
didn't
have
any
immunity
which
they
could
waive.
mr.
everett
rowe
well
of
course
they
have
that
--
mr.
everett
rowe
they
have
a
description.
mr.
everett
rowe
they
have
to
sue
somebody.
mr.
everett
rowe
state
is
sovereign
in
nevada.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
we
sue
a
political
entity
called
--
mr.
everett
rowe
certainly.
it
has
a
right
to
have
its
constitution.
it
has
a
right
to
either
waive
or
not
waive
immunity.
it
has
a
right
to
setup
its
statutory
scheme
of
waiver,
but
that's
a
relationship
between
the
governed
and
the
governor.
mr.
everett
rowe
that
would
be
--
i
would
accept
that
within
the
state
of
nevada.
mr.
everett
rowe
within
the
state
of
nevada
only.
outside
of
nevada,
i
think
that
the
general
rules
of
choice
of
law
of
the
other
state.
and
its
constitutional
right
of
choice
of
law
would
apply,
because
it
is
not
the
same
situation.
mr.
everett
rowe
certainly
could,
right.
mr.
everett
rowe
could
you
repeat
that
question
again
your
honor?
mr.
everett
rowe
no.
it
would
be
same
as
california
has
the
same
amount
of
sovereignty
that
nevada
has
but,
the
question
is
where
the
action
–-
mr.
everett
rowe
there
is
a
concept
in
the
law
that
california
has
the
supreme
sovereignty
when
nevada
is
engaging
in
activities
within
its
state.
and
that
any
power
of
the
state
of
nevada
would
be
severe.
mr.
everett
rowe
for
an
accident
happening
in
california.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
it's
an
interesting
question,
we
don't
have
before
us.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
california
of
course
has
no
limitation.
i
really
don't
know
answer
to
what
might
happen
under
those
circumstances,
but
i
would
and
i
don't
want
to
hazard
a
guess
because
it's
not
really
before
us.
mr.
everett
rowe
i
don't
know
whether
we
do
or
not,
i
would
certainly
think
with
the
attitude
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
they
would
have
to
–-
mr.
everett
rowe
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
everett
rowe
we
have
searched
all
of
the
cases
and
it
seems
to
be
and
it's
a
very
strange
thing
that
this
is
a
cause
of
first
impressionist's
type
of
an
automobile
accident
case.
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
historical
things
that
i
could
go
in,
why
it
didn't
originate
in
the
early
history
but
--
mr.
everett
rowe
that's
correct.
mr.
everett
rowe
yes.
mr.
everett
rowe
there
is
a
section
that
they
have
cited
in
their
--
that
requires
indemnification
by
the
state
of
negligent
acts
of
employees.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
i
don't
think
there
will
be
a
question
of
collectability.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
we
could
have
done
perhaps
done
that,
but
i
don't
know
what
the
–-
mr.
everett
rowe
i
don't
think
that
the
--
yes
we
sued.
what
happened
is
that
the
employee
died
as
a
result
of
the
accident.
and
the
state
was
commenced
within
the
state
of
the
california,
the
place
of
his
death,
we
filed
a
claim
against
the
administrator
and
a
complaint
against
the
administrator
of
this
state
and
judgment
was
rendered
against
him,
which
they
-–
even
though
they
defended
him
never
appealed
and
which
is
final
and
which
–-
mr.
everett
rowe
i'm
not
sure
whether
their
indemnification
provision
was
in
effect
at
the
time
the
accident
happened.
it
is
in
their
1977
amendments,
which
they
have
and
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
have
a
retroactive
effect.
mr.
everett
rowe
well,
we
have
the
practice
–-
no
i
didn't
want,
we
didn't
want.
we
have
the
practice
of
suing
--
the
state
owned
the
automobile.
the
driver
was
an
employee
of
the
university
of
nevada.
so,
on
the
side
of
caution
and
through
years
of
being
exposed
to
having
sued
the
wrong
defendant,
we
sued
all
of
the
defendants.
thank
you.
