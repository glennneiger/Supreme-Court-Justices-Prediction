justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying
mr.
dyer
that
the
only
--
after
all
what
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
says
shall
be
given
as
to
the
public
acts
records
and
judicial
proceedings.
the
only
public
act
of
nevada
that
you
urge
has
been
denied
full
faith
and
credit,
is
your
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
statute
in
the
$25,000
limitation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
only
extent
to
which
you
rely
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
except
mr.
dyer
at
least
in
words.
full
faith
and
credit
shall
be
given
to
each
state
to
the
public
acts,
records
and
judicial
proceedings
of
every
other
state,
that's
the
whole
of
the
clause
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
how
do
we
read
into
what
you
have
just
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
always
in
the
context
of
whether
or
not,
what
we
are
dealing
with
the
public
acts,
records
and
judicial
proceedings
have
you
ever
stated
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
even
if
you
didn't
have
your
sovereign
immunity
limitation
act,
you
will
be
making
the
argument
with
full
faith
and
credit
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'd
just
like
to
ask
you
a
question
for
my
own,
so
i
can
understand
it
before
you
sit
down
mr.
dyer.
how
far
does
your
argument
go
today
that
there
couldn't
be
a
suit
at
all
that
any
suit
would
have
had
to
have
been
brought
by
the
california
plaintiff
in
rsb
county
nevada,
since
that
was
the
extent
of
the
waiver
of
sovereignty
or
sovereignty
immunity.
do
you
take
that
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
talk
about
what
the
court
might
hold,
what
the
court's
position
might
be.
i'm
asking
you
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
rsb
county
nevada
for
a
limit
of
$25,000
period.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it,
that's
your
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
got
quite
a
part
from
the
alleged
waiver
in
the
california
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understood.
