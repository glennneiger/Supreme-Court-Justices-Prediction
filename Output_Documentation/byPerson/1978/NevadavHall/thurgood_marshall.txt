justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
argue
the
case
and
then
say
you
don't
infer
the
casting
aside
the
sovereign
immunity.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
to
be
rather
specific
on
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
the
contrary
case,
you
said
just
by
sending
the
man
over
there
would
be
enough.
you
certainly
don't
mean
that
now,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
the
court,
me
at
the
behest
of
my
intelligence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
state
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
car
going
out
except
the
owner,
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
upset
that
you
are
not
in
the
state's
army
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
theory
is
that
this
respondent
who
was
playing
it
below
can
get
more
money
in
a
california
court
from
nevada,
then
nevada
would
give
him
in
nevada.
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
that
strike
you
as
funny?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
imagine
anything
like
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
imagine
anything
like
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no
i
said
if
the
accident
happened
in
california
and
you
sued
nevada
in
nevada.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
get
$25,000.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
you
sued
in
california,
you
would
get
the
moon.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
me
it
is
the
moon,
i
don't
know,
well
you
are
wealthy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
i
understand
their
position.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said
if
you
want
them
to
give
up
their
sovereignty,
they
would
give
it
up
on
their
terms.
but,
i
had
terms
of
25,000.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rowe
suppose
nevada
just
stayed
patent
and
not
waived
any
of
its
immunity,
you
couldn't
have
sued
at
all,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
they
come
in
as
a
sovereign,
with
a
crown
on
as
sovereign
meeting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
talking
about
today.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
talking
about
where
they
had
no
--
they
haven't
waived
their
sovereignty
by
statute
of
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
theory
is
that
california
drove
in
--
i
mean
that
the
nevada
drove
in,
but
that's
not
a
bad
theory
but
we
will
go
your
theory
that
nevada
drove
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
waived
their
sovereign
immunity.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
sue
them?
as
soon
as
you
say
state
of
nevada,
you
say
sovereignty
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
state
of
sovereignty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
sue
the
sovereignty,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
sued
nevada
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
is
still
in
high
school
and
yet
today.
if
they
waive
sovereign
immunity
isn't
it
generally
understood
that
you
waived
it
on
your
own
terms.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
general
statement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand,
your
point
is
they
could
sue
without
this
statute.
they
could
sue
nevada
without
the
statute.
