justice

but
one
of
them
wasn't
immunity
from
federal
suit
was
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
i
mean
immunity
from
the
suit
by
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
if
there
is
judgment
entered
against
the
state.
how
would
california
collect
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you've
got
money
in
california,
property
in
california
otherwise
you
could
just
protect
yourself
in
our
own
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
if
you
decided
that
by
your
own
law
they
had
no
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
general
dyer,
i
asked
you
before
about
a
contract
action,
you
said
that
would
be
different.
supposing
this
were
a
willful,
wonton
and
malicious
tort;
would
you
take
the
same
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
of
nevada
sense
that
is
a
state
militia
and
take
over
a
part
of
somebody's
private
property
in
the
other
state,
so
that
would
be
immune
under
your
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
rely
on
the
dignity
of
the
sovereign
not
to
do
anything
like
that
of
course.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
chop
down
all
the
trees
and
dig
up
the
roads
and
that
will
be
immune
from
liability.--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
your
view
that
they
could,
that
the
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
simply
right
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
assuming
individual
not
to
the
other
state,
just
you
go
and
chop
down
a
lot
of
trees
and
hollow
away
the
wood
or
something
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rowe
there
aren't
very
many
cases
involving
the
fact
situations
of
this
type,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
relying
on
the
policy
case
in
anyway,
the
north
dakota
case
of
some
years
ago.
the
california
court
cited
but
you
don't
cite
it
in
you
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
to
come
as
post
--
factually
as
any
case
there
is,
but
you
can't
really
on
it
very
much,
you
don't
cite
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
your
opponent
doesn't
cite
it
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it,
who
you
would
limit
in
the
california's
right
or
your
client's
right
to
sue
nevada
–-
what
would
have
been
the
case
if
you
had
sued
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
nevada
have
less
sovereign
immunity
than
the
state
of
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
california
say
nevada
has
no
sovereign
immunity
in
the
state,
although
the
state
of
california
does.
it
has
complete
sovereignty.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
if
in
the
california
courts
you
could
sue
california
only
for
an
amount
up
to
$10,000,
let's
assume
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
california,
now
could
nevada
be
sued
in
the
california
courts
for
more
than
that
or
could
california
decide
that
yes
it
could
have
an
unlimited
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
didn't
the
california
court
say
that
it
shouldn't
be
any
better
offs
in
the
state
of
california.
so,
i
wonder
what
is
the
rule
that
california
indicated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
entertain
suits
by
nevada
in
the
california
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
entertain
suits
to
collect
taxes
by
the
state
of
nevada
in
the
california
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
apart
from
automobiles,
you
do
have
paulus-–
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
sue
the
university
of
nevada
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
there
some
policy
in
nevada
that
by
which
state
agencies
pay
the
judgments
for
their
negligent
employees
or
do
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
was
your
problem
then
--
there
wasn't
any
problem
in
collectability
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
i
mean
if
you
had
just
sued
the
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
what
people
normally
do,
because
they
think
sovereigns
are
immune.
so
why
didn't
you
just
--
did
you
sue
the
employee
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
weren't
they
--
under
the
nevada
law,
wouldn't
nevada
have
paid
that
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
must
have
had
some
reason
for
suing
the
university
other
than
bringing
a
case
of
first
impression.
