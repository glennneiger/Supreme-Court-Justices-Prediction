justice
potter
stewart
as
i
was
reading
the
briefs
in
this
case,
the
question
that
kept
recurring
to
me
is;
what
is
the
federal
issue
here?
what
is
the
federal
question?
california
has
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
its
state
law,
that
a
state
of
the
union
does
not
have
sovereign
immunity
in
the
california
courts.
what
is
the
federal,
what
is
--
why
constitutionally,
what
is
the
claimant?
justice
potter
stewart
now
why
is
it
just
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
now
how
the
constitution
would
prevent
it
from
doing
that?
that
is
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
never
question.
i
mean
a
state
can
decide
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
its
courts
can
decide
or
its
legislature
can
decide
that
it
does
not
have
sovereign
immunity.
and
so
far
as
suits
its
state
courts
can
go
against
it,
why
can't
it
make
the
same
sort
of
decision
with
respect
to
another
state,
when
sued
in
its
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
against
the
background
of
the
supremacy
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rowe,
i
understand
you
to
say
you
had
written
a
letter
to
the
court
about
some
case?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
delivered?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
seem
to
have
a
copy
of
it.

potter
stewart
510
p.
2d.
879.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
it
is
against
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
your
point
is
that
nevada
is
a
sovereign
within
its
own
and
over
its
own
territory,
right
period.
justice
potter
stewart
has
this
kind
of
a
case
ever
risen
in
nevada.
has
california
ever
been
sued
in
nevada?
