justice
john
paul
stevens
general
dyer,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
your
theory.
supposing
instead
of
this
being
a
tort
action,
it
was
a
contract
action.
say,
your
state
agents
had
gone
over
to
california
and
bought
$0.5
million
worth
of
the
television
sets
for
the
use
of
their
universities.
then
they
went
back
to
nevada
and
just
decided
they
wouldn't
pay.
could
do
that
be
sued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
was
negotiated
in
california,
they
had
sent
people
out
with
authority,
issued
by
the
governor
and
the
state
legislature
to
go
to
california
and
buy
a
lot
of
television
sets.
and
they
did
it
in
california
and
then
they
just
refused
to
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is

justice
john

stevens
the
second
case,
77-1337,
comes
to
us
from
the
california
state
courts
and
presents
us
with
a
fundamental
question
of
sovereign
immunity
that
has
not
previously
been
decided
or
even
considered
by
any
federal
court.
that
question
is
whether
a
california
state
court
can
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
sovereign
state
of
nevada
when
nevada
refuses
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity.
the
case
arises
out
of
an
automobile
collision
on
a
california
highway.
the
respondents,
who
are
california
residents,
were
severely
injured
as
a
result
of
the
negligence
of
an
agent
of
the
state
of
nevada.
they
brought
suit
in
the
california
courts
and
obtained
a
judgment
of
$1,150,000
against
nevada.
nevada
claims
that
it
is
either
entirely
immune
from
suit
in
the
courts
of
the
sister
state
or
at
the
very
least
that
the
recovery
should
be
limited
to
$25,000,
which
is
the
maximum
amount
that
could
be
recovered
if
nevada
had
been
sued
in
its
own
courts.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
point
out
that
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
actually
encompasses
two
quite
different
concepts.
one
applicable
to
suits
in
the
sovereign’s
own
courts
and
the
other
to
suits
in
the
court’s
of
another
sovereign.
with
respect
to
the
former,
only
the
sovereign’s
consent
can
qualify
the
absolute
character
of
its
immunity.
but
with
respect
to
the
latter,
as
chief
justice
marshall
explained
in
a
case
decided
in
1812
involving
an
attempt
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
emperor
of
france,
immunity
is
a
matter
of
committee
determined
by
the
laws
of
the
sovereign
in
whose
courts
the
claim
is
asserted.
although
it
has
been
the
prevailing
practice
throughout
our
history
for
sovereigns
to
accord
one
another
immunity
as
a
matter
of
committee,
california
has
now
decided
to
adopt
the
different
policy
in
its
courts.
we
find
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
prevents
california
from
making
this
determination
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
nor
do
we
find
any
constitutional
basis
for
nevada’s
claim
that
it
is
either
immune
from
suit
in
the
california
courts
or
that
california
must
respect
the
limitation
on
liability
that
would
apply
if
nevada
had
been
sued
in
its
own
courts.
accordingly,
we
reject
nevada’s
claim
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
filed
scholarly
dissenting
opinions
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
