well,
ordinarily
the
full
faith
and
credit
relates
to
acts
and
events,
which
have
occurred
within
the
state
which
is
asking
full
faith
and
credit
be
given
to
its
law,
not
--
this
is
an
extra
territorial
effect
that
you
are
asking
for,
it
would
appear
of
the
nevada
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
particular
provision
of
the
constitution,
i
think
mr.

probing
for
that.
what
particular
provision

us
that?
chief

got
jurisdiction

the
state
of
nevada
or
its
instruments,
expect

their
consent
and
their
waiver?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
reference
tells
us
that
when
nevada
consented
when
waived,
you
took
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
that
is
you
took
the
jurisdiction
with
the
limitation,
which
nevada
has
prescribed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
client

have
sued

could
it?

they

not
performing
a
