justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
putting
to
one
side
the
possible
arguments
you
may
make
by
implication
from
cases
like
that.
why
can't
california
rely
on
the
tenth
amendment
here
just
as
well
or
perhaps
better
than
nevada
saying
that
all
power
is
not
delegated
somewhere
else
are
reserved
to
it,
so
it
didn't
give
up
the
power
to
adjudicate
claims
over
other
states
when
it
entered
the
union
and
so
that
it's
reserved
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
not
treated
by
removal
basically.
the
authority
of
congress
over
the
federal
courts
and
the
right
to
remove
when
a
federal
officer
named
a
defendant
in
the
state
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
simply
because
the
nevada
courts
have
held
their
sovereign
immunity
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
had
said
there
is
no
longer
any
sovereign
immunity
in
nevada.
you
would
not
then
be
able
go
into
california
and
say
even
though
you
can
recover
a
million
dollar
judgment
against
the
state
of
nevada
in
the
nevada
courts.
you
can't
sue
us
in
california,
would
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
does,
but
so
the
facts
you
can
make,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
statute
or
a
decisional
law
in
nevada,
does
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
could
have
been
that
simply
this
--
i
take
it
if
there
had
been
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
even
pro
tanto
as
there
has
been
by
the
nevada
statute,
but
the
nevada
supreme
court
had
held
that
nevada
continued
to
adhere
the
rule
of
sovereign
immunity,
you
would
urge
that
as
a
full
faith
and
credit
principle
that
had
to
apply
in
california
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
see
anomaly
there
in
a
federal
union
that
the
courts
of
the
union
are
not
allowed
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
state
of
nevada
in
the
situation,
but
the
courts
of
a
sisters
state
like
california
are?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
presumably
it
is
in
the
federal
jurisdiction
whether
it's
in
nevada
or
in
california.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that
isn't
the
reason
relied
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
california,
is
it
that
nevada
itself
had
abandoned
sovereignty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
been
reading
the
ads.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rowe
could
i
ask
you
a
question.
following
up
on
my
brother
marshall's
question
to
you.
this
lawsuit
was
originally
filed
in
placer
county
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
nevada
venues?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
only
in
ormsby
county
if
it's
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
felt
bound
suing
in
california
and
going
against
their
principle
of
sovereign
immunity
to
nonetheless
follow
the
nevada
venue
provision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
oakland?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
oakland?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
suppose
verdicts
tend
to
be
higher
in
oakland
than
they
do
in
placer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
need
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
could
decide
the
case
in
your
favor
by
saying
that
there
is
no
constitutional
limitation
on
the
right
of
california
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
situations
like
this.
but
if
we
were
to
conclude
along
the
lines
that
you
have
just
stated
that
may
be
nevada
public
policy
isn't
all
that
different
from
the
supreme
court
of
california.
we
couldn't
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
for
the
reasons
it
gave,
could
we?
because
it
didn't
purport
to
consider
nevada
public
policy.
