in
addition
to
the
violation
of
miranda,
which
you
say
relies
on
both
the
evidence
that
approaches
intoxication
and
the
fact
that
he
tried
to
contact
his
lawyer.
what
about
just
the
second
factor,
the
lawyer
point.
was
there
a
violation
of
his
to
right
to
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
you
indicated
that
they
overheard
his
conversation
and
knew
he
was
seeking
the
assistance
of
a
lawyer
and
was
dropping
coins
all
over
the
floor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
different
if
he
had
said
unambiguously,
i’d
rather
not
talk
to
you
until
i
consult
my
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
think
that
would
make
a
difference,
is
it
–
and
i
don’t
think
either
the
trial
court
or
the
supreme
court
made
a
determination
of
whether
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
contact
counsel
kind
of
an
escobedo
type
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
conceivable
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case
would
be
to
send
it
back
to
determine
whether
his
telephone
call
was
the
equivalent,
i
suppose
one
could
argue
it
was
substantially
the
equivalent
of
an
attempt
as
for
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
a
sense
of
our
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that
poses
me
about
this
case
is
why
the
officer
–
when
the
man
mentioned
he
had
some
information
about
the
biggies,
why
the
office
didn’t
say,
tell
me
about
them?
i
just
don’t
understand
it,
why
he
wouldn’t
be
interested
in
knowing
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
i
wonder?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
just
perceive
it
with
one
more
question
if
i
may.
isn’t
that
correct
that
in
your
view
of
the
law
is
followed
by
this
court?
in
a
future
identical
situation
the
officer
would
be
well
advised
to
pursue
the
interrogation
to
find
out
about
the
biggies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
is
right,
i
mean
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
not
be
able
to
use
the
statement
against
the
man
himself,
but
he
would
be
able
to
use
the
information
for
further
investigative
purposes
and
it
might
lead
to
the
discovery
of
other
evidence
which
would
be
entirely
admissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
exactly
what
this
officer
did.
he
said,
don’t
you
have
anything
in
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don’t
know
why
it
wouldn’t
have
been
equally
natural
to
say,
when
he
said,
i
know
a
lot
about
the
biggies,
who
are
they?
i
don’t
know
why
one
is
anymore
natural
than
the
other,
thats
puzzles
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
it
wouldn’t,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
win,
that’s
exactly
what
police
officers
ought
to
do,
they
ought
to
follow-up
on
these
leads
to
get
the
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
under
your
theory
as
i
understand
it
because
his
constitutional
rights
are
not
violated
unless
his
own
statement
is
used
at
the
trial,
at
his
trial
against
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
yeah.
i
don’t
understand,
you
are
not
taking
the
broad
position,
alright,
i
am
just
a
little
puzzled
that
any
derivative
evidence
may
be
used
in
the
trial
other
than
the
statement
itself
as
long
as
it’s
not
coercive
in
a
constitutional
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
if
you
are,
you
should
say
that
they
could
ask
him
about
the
biggies
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
may
not
possibly,
but
definitely
they
can.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
that
wouldn’t
be
–
that
wouldn’t
violate
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
agree
then
that
in
the
future
if
you
win
this
case,
they
ought
to
be
able
to
ask
about
the
biggies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
is
clear
from
the
opinion
that
it
rested
both
on
the
massachusetts
constitution
and
the
federal
constitution,
then
it
does
rest
on
an
adequate
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
must
be
dismissed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen,
i
think
there
is
another
problem
with
your
argument
here,
the
massachusetts
law
as
i
understand,
had
taken
most
favorably
to
you
is
that,
if
there
is
a
constitutional
violation,
then
the
derivative
use
of
the
evidence
obtained
by
means
of
the
constitutional
violation
cannot
be
used
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
however
your
opponent
challenges
the
existence
of
the
constitutional
violation.
his
argument
is
that
miranda
properly
construed
does
not
involve
the
constitutional
violation.
and
as
to
that
point,
massachusetts
supreme
court
relied
only
on
federal
law
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
whether
the
violation
of
the
teaching
of
miranda
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
on
page
78,
they
are
talking
about
assuming
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
may
the
evidence
nevertheless
be
used
to
get
a
warrant.
that’s
what
the
issue
they
were
discussing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
first
sentence
of
preceding
paragraphs
in
the
hall
case,
we
recognize
that
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
constitutional
guarantees
(inaudible).
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
that
you
prevail
that
goes
back
and
it
could
then
rest
it
on
the
state
constitution,
couldn't
they,
and
then
reinstate
their
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don’t
know
i
say
if
you
prevail
here
and
this
reverse
and
it
goes
back.
can
the
massachusetts’s
supreme
court
reinstate
their
judgment
on
basis
to
their
state
constitution?
that’s
what
happened
in
opperman,
isn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it’s
not
a
possibility.
