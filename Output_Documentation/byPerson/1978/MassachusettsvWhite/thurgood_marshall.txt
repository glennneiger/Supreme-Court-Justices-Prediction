justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
not
only
cite
miranda
but
quote
from
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
just,
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
they
cited
and
quoted
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
didn't
get
you,
you
draw
the
conclusion
that
you
relied
on
both.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can’t
you
say
as
both
or
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
your
opponent
is
gone
if
it
is
both.
justice
thurgood
marshall
give
me
a
citation,
that
way,
they
relied
on
both.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
tell
me
what,
this
court
said
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
may
ask,
when
did
this
court
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
sent
it
back
to
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don’t
you
stick
on
it
instead
of
the
other
one?
and
requests
would
be
sent
back
to
determine
that
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
court
dismisses
improvidently
granted
cases
before
1920.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought,
when
did
this
court
start
the
dismissal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
in
1940?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
think
that
judge
jackson
was
here
in
1920.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
be
surprised
then
because
it’s
not
important
one
way
or
the
other.
all
i
am
trying
to
say
is
why
don’t
make
this
is
a
separate
point
that
the
court
did
not
rely
miranda
but
say
that
it
could
have
been
charged
and
relied
on
both
and
therefore
sent
it
back.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
am
sorry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
you
read
--
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
was
a
constitutional
guarantee,
is
that
state
or
federal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no,
is
it
state
or
federal?
oh,
it’s
unclear.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
halls
did
talk
about
miranda.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
in
miranda
v.
arizona.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
i
said
hafas.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
we
would
have
to
go
back
and
read
them
off.
