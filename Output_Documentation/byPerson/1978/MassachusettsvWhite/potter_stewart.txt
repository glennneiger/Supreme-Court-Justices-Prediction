ms.

isn’t
it
true
that
the
common
law
did
make
the
inventory
search
argument
in
the
supreme
judicial
court.
the
supreme
judicial
court
rejected
the
argument
straight
on
and
then
in
your
questions
that
you
presented
in
your
se
petition,
you
did
not
raise
that
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it’s
not
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
rule
squarely
on
a
contention
that
the
search
could
be
justified
on
an
inventory
theory
and
you
lost
on
that
theory
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
justice
potter
stewart
even
that’s
how
--
how
its
certainly
true
that
not
all
police
interrogation
is
inherently
coercive.
wasn’t
the
thesis
of
the
miranda
opinion
that
police
interrogation
of
a
person
in
the
custody
of
the
police,
in
custody,
in
restrain,
wasn’t
inevitably
inherently
coercive?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
the
premise
of
the
whole?
justice
potter
stewart
the
judgment
and
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
not
all
police
interrogation
but
all
in
police
interrogation
of
a
person
in
the
custody.
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
miranda
opinion
itself
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
miranda
opinion
itself
which
of
course
covered
five
different
cases
as
you
know,
conceded
that
some
of
the
statements
and
at
least
some
of
those
cases
were
not
involuntary
statements
in
the
traditional
meaning
of
that
word.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
statement
is
admissible
if
a
person
is
given
his
miranda,
so
called
miranda
warnings.
it
is
admissible.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it’s
involuntary,
it’s
inadmissible
for
any
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
admissible
if
the
miranda
warnings
were
given.
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
your
position
with
respect
to
an
arrested
criminal
defendant,
who
was
under
the
influence
of
alcohol,
who
proceeded
to
recite
a
full
confession
of
the
acts
which
amounted
to
the
commission
of
a
crime?
would
you
feel
that
was
inadmissible?
justice
potter
stewart
the
defendant
was
drunk,
isn’t
that
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
any
event,
the
policeman
apparently
accurately
predicted
the
later
decisions
of
the
courts
of
your
state.
justice
potter
stewart
your
fourth
choice
then
is
to
affirm
the
supreme
judicial
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
point
is
if
it’s
not
clear,
whether
or
not
the
state
court
relied
upon
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground,
then
it’s
encountered
upon
this
court
to
remand
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
did.
i
think
it’s
clear
that
the
judgment
rests
upon
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
and
this
court
simply
has
no
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
inconsistant
between
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
well
they
may
have
relied
on
some
previous
massachusetts
cases,
but
what
did
those
cases
rely
on?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand,
but
what
did
those
cases
in
turn
rely
on?
were
those
interpretations
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
which
federal
constitutional
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
federal
--
did
it
deal
with
federal
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
said
the
fourth
amendment
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
may
be,
but
just
because
the
court
here
cited
some
previous
massachusetts
cases
doesn’t
indicate
to
me
that
there
was
a
state
ground
involved.
justice
potter
stewart
those
states
might
just
have
been
interpretations
of
the
federal
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
i
will
ask
you
this.
there
is
no
mention
of
the
state
constitution
in
this
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
mention
of
the
state
constitution
in
the
two
state
cases
that
this
opinion
cited?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
was
there
any
direct
mention
of
the
state
constitution,
any
of
the
state
cases
that
these
two
cases
cited?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
just
an
argument;
they
got
it
remanded
under
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
am
i
right
mr.
cohen,
i’ve
been
reading
some
recent
opinions
of
your
supreme
judicial
court
and
i
have
been
interested
that
it
has
often
--
these
opinions
often
wind
up
and
we
are
resting
this
decision
on
our
state
constitution
and
not
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
is
a
new
practice
of
your
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
here
they
did
say,
i
think
it’s
one
i
am
checking
out.
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
are
resting
it
squarely
on
their
constitution
that
they
did
not
agree.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
you
are
saying
at
most
then
is
that
this
ought
to
be
cripped
sent
back
to
reconsideration?
justice
potter
stewart
they
rested
on
a
statement,
constitutional
ground
as
well
as
the
federal
ground.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cohen,
you
very
carefully
stated
twice
that
this
evidence
was
obtained
in
violation
of
both
miranda
and
the
constitution
of
guarantee.
justice
potter
stewart
apparently
you
have
to
accept
the
suggestion
of
your
opponent
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
do
with
michigan
against
tucker?
justice
potter
stewart
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
was
before
the
miranda.
justice
potter
stewart
just
stopping
you
just
for
a
moment
on
the
counsel
point.
do
you
arguing
dependently
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
is
a
waiver?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
quite
a
difference
of
opinion
about
what
a
waiver
is?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
would
say
then
that
there
would
be
no
way
that
the
police
having
illicitly
heard
that
there
was
additional
drugs
in
the
car.
they
could
no
way
get
into
the
car.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
then
that
if
the
police
said,
the
officers
said,
well
i
know
i
shouldn’t
have
heard
this,
but
i
have
heard
it,
i
do
know
there
is
contraband
in
the
car,
so
i
will
just
enter
the
car
and
take
the
contraband.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
but
let’s
just
assume
that
he
heard
it
from
him,
like
he
did.
justice
potter
stewart
could
he
use
it
at
all
to
get
into
the
car?
justice
potter
stewart
not
even
to
seize
contraband.
justice
potter
stewart
would
there
be
an
exception
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
your
answer
is,
no
there
would
be
no
way
they
could
get
into
the
car.
justice
potter
stewart
although
the
police
know
there
is
contraband
in
the
car,
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
about
it
because
of
this
violation
of
miranda.
justice
potter
stewart
that
said,
your
view
is
that
constitutionally
they
are
forbidden
to
get
into
the
car?
