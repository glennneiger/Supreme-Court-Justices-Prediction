mr.
robert
s.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
my
name
is
robert
s.
cohen
and
i
represent
the
respondent
charles
f.
white.
respondent
contends
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
lacks
finality
and
is
not
a
final
judgment
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1257(3).
additionally
respondent
submits
that
because
of
the
decision
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
it
is
unclear
as
to
whether
it
is
based
on
the
massachusetts
constitution
or
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
this
honorable
court
should
either
remand
the
case
back
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
for
clarification
of
its
decision
or
if
it
decides
not
to
do
that,
and
not
remand
the
case
back
to,
the
court
should
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari
as
being
improvidently
granted.
as
concern
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
respondent
contends
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
is
correct
in
ordering
suppression
of
a
contraband
and
money
obtained
under
a
search
warrant,
which
was
based
on
information
secured
in
violation
of
constitutional
guarantees.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
my
third
choice
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
it
either
be
remanded
or
that
the
writ
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted
or
that
the
case
be
affirmed.
addressing
the
jurisdictional
questions
first,
respondent
contends
that
since
he
is
subject
to
further
proceedings
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
including
a
new
trial
that
the
supreme
judicial
court’s
decision
is
not
final.
it
is
submitted
that
the
denial
of
certiorari
for
lack
of
a
final
judgment
in
cohen
versus
new
york,
385
us
976
demonstrates
that
there
is
no
unvarying
rule
that
all
decisions
of
a
state’s
high
court
concerning
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
a
final
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
under
section
1257(3).
turning
to
the
issue
of
independent
state
grounds,
respondent
contends
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
is
unclear
as
to
whether
it’s
based
on
the
massachusetts
constitution
or
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well
your
honor,
please
beside
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
think
your
honor,
please
--
it
is
still
unclear
because
in
addition
to
besides
citing
miranda,
besides
to
massachusetts.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
they
cited
miranda
your
honor.
they
also
cited
the
two
massachusetts
cases,
when
they
were
directly
talking
about
the
point
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
saying
that
it’s
unclear,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
it’s
both,
your
honor.
it’s
unclear
whether
it
was
relied
on
one
or
either
of
them.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
would
say
not
your
honor
if
it
is
relied
on
both,
my
understanding
of
the
law
is
that
it
would
be
in
independent
state
ground.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
believe
your
honor
california
versus
acevedo,
when
this
case
was
remanded
back
down
to
the
california
courts,
they
said
that
they
relied
on
both
and
that
the
latter.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
no,
the
california
court
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
it’s
my
understanding
your
honor,
please
that
in
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
back
to
the
state
court
if
that
is
a
basis
for
upholding
the
decision,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well
i
say
your
honor
please
that
the
case
is
seem
to
indicate
in
independent
state
grounds
that
the
court
has
taken
two
approaches.
it
is
either
remanded
the
case
back
apparently.
up
to
the
1920s,
the
standard
approach
was
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
being
improvidently
granted.
after
that
the
court
has
taken
two
approaches.
in
some
cases
they
have
dismissed
the
writ
as
being
improvidently
granted
and
other
cases
they
have
remanded
the
case
back
for
clarification.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
i
didn’t
hear
the
question.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
change
came
in
herb
v.
pitcairn
in
the
minnesota-tea
case
where
at
least
in
herb
v.
pitcairn,
justice
jackson
said
that
pursuant
consistent
with
the,
if
i
may
quote
your
honor?
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
no,
the
herb
v.
pitcairn
case
was
late
your
honor.
i
believe
the
national
tea
case,
minnesota-national
tea
was
early
on.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
no,
in
herb
v.
pitcairn,
he
was
your
honor
when
he
cited
in
that
case
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
thought
that’s
what
i
was
saying
your
honor,
apparently
i
wasn’t
saying
it
too
clearly.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
apologize
for
not
expressing
myself
more
clearly
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
correct
your
honor.
it
should
be
dismissed
if
it
is
clear,
if
its
unclear,
then
the
case
should
be
refused.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
agree
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
correct
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
must
be
dismissed
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
believe
so
your
honor
but
this
case
in
my
opinion
does
not
an
opulent
inventory
situation
but
only
presents
a
situation
of
the
use
of
illegally
obtained
statements.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well
i
don’t
think
that
they
did
lean
so
heavily
in
miranda
your
honor.
i
think
they
leaned
heavily
on
the
two
prior
stated
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
cases,
indeed
your
honor,
please
the
court
stated
that
from
these
cases
it
follows,
making
reference
to
two
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
cases,
from
these
cases
it
follows
that
neither
made
such
statements.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
reading
your
honor
please,
appendix
78.
the
third
complete
paragraph
your
honor.
the
paragraphs
down
the
bottom.
from
these
cases,
it
follows
that
neither
made
such
statements
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
considering
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
to
hold
otherwise
wouldn’t
affect
sanction
the
initial
violations
of
constitutional
guarantees
which
the
judge
found
took
place
in
the
police
barracks.
the
need
to
prevent
such
violations
from
escaping
review
underlines
the
so
called
fruit
of
a
poisonous
tree
doctrine,
set
forth
in
silverthorne
lumber
co.
versus
united
states
and
nardone
versus
united
states.
although
this
exact
issue
has
not
been
determined
by
the
supreme
court,
but
cf.
michigan
versus
tucker,
we
believe
that
hass
controls
the
issue
in
this
commonwealth
and
i
am
saying
that
when
the
supreme
judicial
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
no
your
honor.
a
look
at
hass
and
hall
the
two
cases
cited
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
in
both
hass
and
hall,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
relied
on
both
massachusetts
state
cases
and
commonwealth
versus
penta
and
on
miranda.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
i
was
just
made
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
two
cases
they
relied
on
were
commonwealth
versus
hall
and
commonwealth
versus
hass.
those
two
cases
relied
on
massachusetts
state
cases,
commonwealth
versus
hall.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
they
were
interpretations
of
constitutional
rights
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well,
the
commonwealth
and
hall,
that
was
search
and
seizure,
that’s
the
fourth
amendment
case.
commonwealth
versus
hass
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
it’s
unclear
again
from
those
decisions,
which
constitutional
rights
they
were
talking
about?
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
agree
with
you
that
certainly
the
federal
fourth
amendment
issue
was
involved
and
i
would
say
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
if
council
argued
or
if
the
emotion
to
suppress
in
that
case
alleged
the
state
grounds.
the
emotion
to
suppress
in
this
case
alleged
state
grounds
along
with
federal
grounds.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well
i
would
say
your
honor
the
further
evidence
of
the
states
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well,
i
would
say
that
further
evidence
of
a
state
ground
your
honor
whereas
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
reluctantly
applied
federal
constitutional
standards.
this
is
a
case
where
the
supreme
judicial
court
suppressed
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
there
is
no
direct
mention
of
it
made
your
honor
please.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
no,
your
honor
please.
but
i
would
say
your
honor
that,
that
particular
fact
does
not
in
itself
say
that
the
case
is
not
ambiguous.
the
cases
seem
to
indicate
that
if
the
thing
was
cited
directly,
then
it
would
be
clear;
there
would
be
no
problem.
here
the
respondent
is
arguing
that
it
is
unclear
and
because
of
being
unclear
consistent
with
the
respective
of
the
highest
courts
of
states
of
the
union,
as
justice
jackson
said,
then
the
supreme
judicial
court
should
be
asked
and
not
be
told.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
yes
it
was
remanded.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well,
i
think
your
honor,
we
are
just
attempting
now
to
be
more
clear
because
of
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
may
differ
with
them
at
certain
policy
issues.
indeed
the
case
that
i
submitted
to
the
court
after
the
filing
of
my
brief,
selectmen
of
framingham
versus
the
municipal
court
of
the
city
of
boston
was
a
case,
with
this
court,
client
to
apply
united
states
versus
janis
and
said
that
in
order
to
uphold
public
confidence
in
the
law
and
judicial
integrity
and
to
control
misconduct
of
the
police,
they
would
not
allow
into
a
civil
service
hearing
evidence
that
was
derived
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
they
did
your
honor
please.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
right.
that
would
be
clear
--
if
that
case
was
up
here,
it’s
clear.
i
am
saying
that
this
case
is
not
clear
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
correct
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
you
make
reference
to
the
waive
your
honor?
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
differ
with
that
your
honor.
that’s
when
they
cited
the
two
cases,
the
two
massachusetts
cases
in
that
section
on
the
appendix
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
it
says,
your
honor,
from
these
cases
it
follows
that
neither
may
such
statements
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
considering
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
i
was
going
to
address
those
issues
currently
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
saying
that,
that
could
refer
to
the
massachusetts
constitution,
the
united
states
constitution,
or
both.
it
doesn’t
say
federal
constitution
your
honor.
it
says
constitutional
guarantees.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
hall,
i
have
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
would
say
that
it’s
unclear
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
it’s
unclear.
in
that
case,
they
do
not
specifically
say
federal
constitution
your
honor.
what
happened
–
hall
was
a
case
of
what’s
--
basically
one
of
the
points
that
it
went
often
was
united
states
versus
giordano
but
the
--
of
this
court,
but
the
supreme
judicial
court
did
not
apply
united
states
versus
giordano
in
total.
so
it
is
unclear
in
that
case
also
whether
it
is
a
combination
of
both
or
based
on
just
the
federal
or
the
state.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
no,
your
honor,
hall
stands
for
the
proposition
that
evidence
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
not
in
hall
your
honor.
that’s
hafas
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
i
didn’t
hear,
i
thought
you
was
saying
hall,
because
hall
was
other
case
we
cited.
yes
hafas
involved
a
miranda
situation
and
it
also
involved
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
yes,
that’s
it
your
honor.
i
say
it
should
be
sent
back
because
of
the
confusion.
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
case
at
bar,
respondent
respectfully
suggests
five
interrelated
arguments
in
support
of
his
contention
that
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
should
be
affirmed.
number
one;
the
questioning
of
the
respondent,
absent
of
valid
waiver
and
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
at
bar
violated
both
miranda
versus
arizona
and
the
fifth
amendment.
number
two
that
the
evidence
obtained
pursuant
to
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant
in
this
case
must
be
suppressed
because
its
admission
would
violate
miranda,
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
policy
under
the
fruit
of
a
poisonous
tree
doctrine.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
yes
your
honor
please.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well,
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
be
used
in
court
your
honor
and
i
am
saying
that
besides
the
statement
not
being
able
to
be
used
in
court,
the
results
of
the
search
warrant
should
not
be
able
to
be
used
in
court
in
the
–
at
least
in
the
prosecution’s
case
in
chief.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well,
no
i
do
not
your
honor,
i
say
that
the
holding
in
miranda
must
be
based
on
the
constitution
that
this
court
has
no
power
to
regulate
or
supervise
state
court’s
absent
a
constitutional
basis,
and
that
at
least
this
concerns
the
waiver
requirements
of
miranda
but
that
has
to
be
constitutionally
mandated.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
michigan
versus
tucker
can
be
distinguished
on
many
points
your
honor.
michigan
versus
tucker
was
a
pre-miranda
case.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
yes,
michigan
versus
tucker,
the
wrong
in
michigan
versus
tucker
was
the
police
did
not
tell
the
defendant
that
he
would
be
furnished
free
counsel.
the
wrong
here
was
not
of
one
of
the
warnings
but
the
inability
of
the
defendant
to
waive
his
constitutional
rights;
it
goes
to
waiver,
and
not
warnings.
number
three;
the
respondent
here
wanted
counsel.
he
was
trying
to
reach
counsel
whereas
in
michigan
versus
tucker,
the
defendant
in
that
case
did
not
want
counsel.
number
four;
in
the
case
at
bar
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
hear
the
question.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
would
say
certainly
your
honor
because
escobedo
was
cited
with
approval
in
brewer
versus
williams.
i
would
say
that
a
combination
of
brewer
versus
williams
and
escobedo
results
in
the
determination
that
the
introduction
of
this
evidence
would
violate
the
sixth
amendment
the
right
to
counsel.
the
respondent’s
fourth
argument
besides
the
violation
of
miranda
and
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
right
to
counsel
is
that
under
the
standards
annunciated
by
this
court
in
united
states
verus
giordano
416
us
505,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
that
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed.
in
giordano,
the
majority
of
this
court
said
that
a
pen
register
application
was
based
on
illegally
(inaudible)
evidence
and
therefore
the
results
obtained
from
the
pen
register
must
be
suppressed.
mr.
justice
powell
in
descent
in
part
said
that
standard
should
not
be
a
critical
element
as
the
major
indicated,
but
the
standard
should
be
whether
they
are
absolutely
a
legally
attained
information.
they
assert
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
was
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
the
superior
court
judge
found
that
unquestionably,
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
looked
at
without
the
illegally
obtained
information
was
not
sufficient
to
raise
the
level
of
probable
cause.
so
respondent
suggests
that
under
united
states
versus
giordano,
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
standards
has
been
met.
finally
if
it
please
the
court,
the
respondent
suggests
that
assuming
arguendo
that
only
the
miranda
prophylactic
safeguards
were
violated
and
not
the
constitution,
and
respondent
previously
suggests
that
it
was
a
constitutional
violation.
but
assuming
arguendo,
then
only
the
prophylactic
safeguards
were
violated.
the
respondent
argues
that
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed.
the
respondent
says
the
evidence
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
thank
you.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
will
continue
to
address
my
arguments
to
the
fifth
amendment
question
involved,
namely
whether
the
fruits
of
evidence
sees
this
result
of
the
statement
should
be
held
suppressible.
responsible
contends
that
the
fifth
amendment
by
its
own
terms
requires
suppression
in
the
case
at
bar.
unlike
the
fourth
amendment,
the
fifth
amendment
is
directly
concerned
with
the
introduction
of
tainted
evidence
at
trial.
primary
purpose
of
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
is
protecting
the
individual
against
being
compelled
to
furnish
evidence
to
convict
him
in
a
criminal
trial.
respondent
suggests
that
the
fifth
amendment
interests
involved
in
the
immune
of
the
cases
are
equivalent
to
those
interests
in
the
case
at
bar.
in
both
instances,
at
bar
to
the
use
of
evidence,
reinstates
the
parties
to
their
respective
positions,
and
upholds
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
concerning
the
respondent’s
final
argument
namely
that
even
if
miranda,
even
if
the
fifth
amendment
and
sixth
amendment
were
not
violated
that
even
under
the
rational
of
michigan
versus
tucker
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
at
bar
should
still
be
suppressed.
respondent
respectfully
suggests
that
the
interests
of
michigan
versus
tucker
that
the
government
in
making
all
available
evidences
to
the
persons
or
people
who
have
to
determine
the
facts
is
outweighed
in
the
case
at
bar
by
the
need
to
deter
police
misconduct
by
concepts
of
judicial
integrity
and
by
the
very
nature
of
our
accusatory
system
of
justice.
it
is
submitted
that
the
allowance
into
evidence
of
the
property
seize
pursuant
to
the
search
warrant
would
encourage
police
violations
of
the
law
because
they
will
have
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
by
interrogating
defendant
without
obtaining
a
valid
waiver.
suppression
of
the
contraband
and
money
is
necessary
to
exhibit
to
the
police
the
fact
of
judicial
disapproval
and
makes
constitutional
rights
credible
to
the
police.
respondent
also
suggests
the
doubt
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
in
deterring
police
misconduct
is
not
applicable
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
area
of
the
case
at
bar.
this
is
so
is
because
one
legal
scholar
has
pointed
out
the
predominant
goal
of
interrogation
is
to
obtain
evidence
for
it’s
used
in
court.
therefore
police
conduct
in
this
area
is
likely
to
be
responsive
to
judicial
rules
of
exclusion.
additionally
the
respondent
respectfully
suggests
that
the
good
faith
factor
mentioned
in
michigan
versus
tucker
is
not
applicable
to
the
case
at
bar.
the
interrogation
in
this
case
was
post-miranda
and
the
respondent
repeatedly
attempted
to
secure
counsel
and
never
abandon
his
effort.
indeed
the
state
trooper
questioned
the
respondent
knowing
that
mr.
white
had
not
waived
his
rights
to
silence
and
to
counsel.
that’s
what
the
superior
court
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
found.
alternatively
respondent
argues
that
some
policy
reasons
argue
against
the
use
of
a
good
faith
defense
in
situations
like
the
case
at
bar.
a
good
faith
defense
puts
the
premium
on
ignorance
of
the
law
and
would
be
an
additional
–
it
would
add
an
additional
and
exceptionally
difficult
fact
finding
process
to
the
already
overburdened
criminal
law
process.
further
the
existence
of
such
a
defense
could
generate
uncertainty
and
invite
calculated
risks
on
the
part
of
the
police,
thereby
defeating
the
primary
goal
of
miranda
to
give
to
the
police
concrete
constitutional
guidelines.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well,
i
would
say
that
number
one,
the
police
officer
in
this
case
did
not
act
in
good
faith.
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
police
officer
knew
that
the
respondent
had
not
waived
his
rights
to
counsel
and
his
right
against
the
self
incrimination.
number
two;
i
would
say
that
there
was
certainty
in
the
law
right
now,
namely
the
police
should
know
and
hopefully
do
know,
that
they
can
not
interrogate
defendants
without
giving
the
miranda
warnings
and
without
the
waiver
that
is
required
under
miranda.
adding
into
a
good
faith,
defence
would
make
this
objective
determination
as
to
the
police
officer,
it
would
aid
a
police
officer
who
was
ignorant,
it
would
not
result
in
police
officer
seeking
additional
training
to
try
to
learn
the
law
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
think
up
to
this
time
the
law
was
clear
your
honor,
namely
without
the
waiver
and
without
the
warnings
of
miranda,
no
evidence
can
be
used,
that’s
what
miranda
said
and
that
basic
issue,
i
don’t
think
a
subject
to
attack.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well,
that’s
true
your
honor.
it
seems
that
waiver
can
be
different
in
fifth
amendment
situations
and
different
in
sixth
amendment
situations,
but
we
have
a
finding
here
by
the
superior
court,
which
was
upheld
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
that
there
was
no
waiver.
the
respondent
would
respectfully
suggests
then
these
circumstances
that
couldn’t
be
a
waiver,
the
respondent
was
described
as
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing,
as
bouncing
off
the
walls.
this
isn’t
a
case
as
the
government
has
argued
of
some
motor
impairment;
this
is
a
person
who
is
described
in
testimony
as
not
having
control
of
himself.
it’s
not
a
simple
case
of
just
having
had
a
0.13
on
a
breathalyzer
test,
there
is
much
more
here
than
that.
this
person
could
not
make
a
voluntary
statement,
because
of
the
problem
with
his
faculties.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well,
i
would
think
your
honor
that
in
order
to
seize
contraband,
a
limited
exception
could
be
created
that
would
allow
the
police
only
to
seize
the
contraband
because
of
the
nature
of
contraband
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well
that
he
had
overheard
it
on
the
telephone
conversation,
there
would
be
no
interrogation
and
miranda
would
not
be
applicable
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
yes,
after
interrogation.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
would
say
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
the
only
limited
exception
would
be
because
of
the
nature
of
contraband,
to
seize
contraband,
certainly
it
cannot
be
used
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
would
argue
that
there
shouldn’t
be
your
honor
but
if
there
was
going
to
an
exception,
then
that
should
be
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
would
say
that
they
should
not
be
or
on
the
alternative,
if
the
court
did
see
(inaudible)
exception
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
not
saying
that
they
couldn’t
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
i
would
argue
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
and
if
it
was
founded
they
should
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
yes
or
in
the
alternative,
if
they
were
able
to
go
into
the
car,
it’d
only
be
to
seize
the
contraband,
not
to
present
that
contraband
in
evidence
in
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
well
i
would
say
your
honor
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
would
say
that
harris
was
a
pre-miranda
situation,
so
harris
would
not
be
authority
on
point.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
believe
that
was
a
pre-miranda
interrogation
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
oregon
v.
hass,
i
believe
your
honor
was
a
post-miranda.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
yes,
but
i
think
that
it
took
that
time
for
the
litigation
to
reach
this
court,
i
believe
that
was
a
pre-miranda
case,
but
the
oregon
v.
hass
situation
was
a
post-miranda.
i
would
your
honor
that
the
court
has
shown
historically
a
concern
for
perjury.
in
that
situation,
it
may
very
well
be
yes,
that
under
harris
and
hass
that
the
evidence
could
be
used
for
impeachment
but
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
today
your
honor.
finally
respondent
suggests
that
the
nature
of
the
adversary
system
and
the
important
of
the
dignity
and
integrity
of
the
individual
require
suppression
of
evidence
obtained
by
questioning
an
individual
who
was
called
bouncing
off
the
walls
and
called
didn’t
know
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
i
would
say
your
honor
please
that
if
a
person
was
voluntarily
bouncing
off
the
walls,
the
previous
case
here
this
morning
may
have
some
applicability.
he
may
be
suffering
some
type
of
mental
disease
but
this
is
not
the
case
here
your
honor.
on
this
case,
the
respondent
was
bouncing
off
the
walls
from
a
combination
of
drugs
and
alcohol,
he
was
–
it’s
in
the
record
that
he
was
scratching
himself
incessantly
and
that
he
didn’t
know
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
that’s
correct.
thus
chief
justice
warren
discussing
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
stated
and
if
i
may
quote
briefly,
"the
constitutional
foundation
underlying
the
privileges
to
respect
the
government,
state
or
federal
must
accord
to
the
dignity
and
integrity
of
its
citizens
to
maintain"
--
mr.
robert
s.
cohen
thank
you
your
honor.
to
maintain
a
fair
state
individual
balance,
to
require
the
government
to
show
that
the
entire
load,
to
respect
the
inviolability
of
the
human
personality,
our
accusatory
system
of
criminal
justice
demands
that
the
government
seeking
to
punish
an
individual
produce
the
evidence
against
him
by
its
own
independent
labors,
rather
than
by
the
cruel
simple
expedient
of
compelling
it
from
his
own
mouth.
thank
you
very
much.
