justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you’re
pointed,
i
taken
is
that
the
recent
miranda
cases
from
this
court
would
not
have
out
the
same
way
if
we
had
been
dealing
with
confessions
that
were
found
to
be
coerce
by
nonetheless
trustworthy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
if
those
statements
instead
of
having
been
taken
in
some
violation
of
miranda,
had
been
found
the
court
to
be
coerce,
the
input
would
have
stopped
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
thing
anything
survives
of
escobedo
after
johnson
versus
new
jersey?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
there
is
anything
left
of
escobedo
against
illinois
after
this
court’s
pro
curium
decision
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey
in
384
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
what’s
your
reply
to
mr.
justice
white’s
concurring
opinion
in
stone
v.
powell
that
exclusion
of
evidence
obtained
in
good
faith
will
never
have
a
deterrent
effect
because
if
people
are
acting
in
good
faith
and
reasonably
they
will
presumably
do
the
same
thing
again.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
we
get
conflicts
between
courts
of
appeals
and
the
state
supreme
courts
on
miranda
points.
isn’t
it
expecting
an
awful
lot
that
the
police
officer
on
the
beat
is
going
to
be
a
final
arbiter
and
not
authorized
to
know
about
the
miranda
document.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
conduct
beyond
his
own
control.
