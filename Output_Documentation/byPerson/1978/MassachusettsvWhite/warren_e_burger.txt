chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
massachusetts
against
white.
ms.
smith,
i
think
you
may
proceed,
whenever
you
are
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
there
some
response
on
the
defendant’s
part
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
massachusetts
--
would
be
have
been
able
to
get
a
warrant,
without
reciting
the
statement
made
that
there
was
more
material
in
the
car
that
he
was
simply
showing,
the
man
was
found
in
dubious
condition
of
–
disoriented
condition
and
that
he
had
a
marijuana
cigarette
on
his
purse,
would
that
be
enough
to
support
one
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
search
of
the
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
not
--
quite
my
question
but
is
there
no
search,
an
inventory
made
at
the
car
when
it’s
taken
into
possession
off
in
the
woods
and
brought
into
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
an
inventory
search
would
be
supportable
and
i
say
if,
then
how
relevant
is
the
warrant
in
all
the
other
issues?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
know
it
should
be
found
and
now
i
thought
what
you
are
presenting
to
this
court,
do
you
or
do
you
not
argue,
but
that
since
an
inventory
search
would
have
been
permitted
with
other
warrant,
but
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
this
one
was
or
was
not
supported,
do
you
make
that
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
entered
that
the
inventory
search
was
the
usual
procedure
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
can
make
the
argument
--
[inaudible]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right,
but
the
corollary
of
that
if
they
are
given
voluntarily
after
miranda
warnings,
they
are
admissible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
it
would
not
have
to
decide
any
other
issues
in
the
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
it
will
be
a
factor
that
would
be
taken
into
account
on
the
voluntariness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
it’s
all
from
the
thought
at
least
that
alcohol
tends
to
loosen
the
tongues,
which
you
don’t
think
there
is
anything
unconstitutional
about,
a
loose
tongued
alcoholic
confession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cohen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
testimony
--
your
argument
then
is
that
by
having
this
statement
you
used
as
a
basis
for
getting
the
warrant,
that’s
testimony
being
used
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
search
had
produced
nothing?
then
would
the
statement
be
a
statement
of
his
own
which
is
used
against
him
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
there
at
1’o
clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
just
add
for
the
--
my
hypothetical
question,
supposing
the
trial
of
those
cases
with
that
evidence
excluded
for
the
purposes
on
this
record,
and
other
words
no
question
about
the
use
of
the
information
to
get
the
warrant,
and
your
client
took
that
stand
and
testified
and
was
asked,
do
you
have
any
other
--
possession
of
any
other
drugs
except
those
found
on
your
purse,
and
he
said,
no.
under
harris
against
new
york,
could
your
statement
be
used
to
impeach
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
your
view
but
what
the
view
of
harris
against
new
york.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
harris,
pre-miranda?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
pre-miranda
in
terms
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
miranda
was
on
the
books
for
three
or
four
years
before
harris
was
decided.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
miranda
was
on
the
books
three
or
four
years
before
harris
was
decided.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
you
are
voluntarily
bouncing
off
the
walls?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further
ms.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
against
white
in
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
