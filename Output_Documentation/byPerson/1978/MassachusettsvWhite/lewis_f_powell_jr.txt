justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
supreme
judicial
court
was
quite
well
aware
in
its
footnote
deciding
after
a
month
that
it
was
--
if
had
had
available
toward
the
massachusetts
constitution
and
didn’t
have
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
state
federal
question
there,
was
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
why
when
it
was
so
clearly
aware
that
it
could
rest
the
decision
either
on
the
federal
or
state
constitutions
in
the
opperman
footnote,
did
it
lean
so
heavily
on
miranda
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
where
are
you
reading
it
from?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
that
wasn’t
hass
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
constitution?
