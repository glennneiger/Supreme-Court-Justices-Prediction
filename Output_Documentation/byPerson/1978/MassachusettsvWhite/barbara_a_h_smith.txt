ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
barbara
a.
h.
smith,
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general.
i
represent
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
the
petitioner
in
this
matter.
the
commonwealth
seeks
review
of
a
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
which
interpreted
this
court’s
decision
in
miranda
versus
arizona
as
requiring
per
say
automatic
exclusion
of
statements
obtained
in
violation
of
the
miranda's
prophylactic
safe-guards
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant.
specifically
the
court
held
that
it
was
err
for
the
trial
judge
to
had
denied
the
defendant
charles
whites’
motion
to
suppress
certain
physical
evidence,
which
had
been
seized
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant.
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
search
warrant
was
based
upon
statements
which
the
trail
court
had
held
should
be
suppressed
to
trail
because
they
were
obtained
in
violation
of
the
waybill
requirement
of
miranda
versus
arizona.
the
supreme
judicial
court
therefore
reversed
the
defendant’s
conviction
on
four
entitlements
charging
possession
of
the
controlled
substance
with
intend
to
distribute.
as
the
commonwealth’s
belief
that
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
taking
of
the
statements
at
issue
is
a
crucial
relevance
to
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
and
therefore
i
will
devote
myself
to
explication
of
those
facts
with
some
particularity.
the
motion
to
suppress
both
the
arresting
officer
and
the
state
trooper,
who
received
the
statements,
testified.
the
arresting
officer
testified
that
on
2
am
in
march
of
1975,
he
was
informed
of
a
motor
vehicle
accident.
he
proceeded
to
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
observed
that
a
car
had
been
driven
over
in
an
embankment
knocking
down
several
highway
posts.
he
observed
the
defendant
charles
white
in
the
car
at
the
bottom
of
the
embankment
attempting
to
drive
it
back
up.
the
defendant
asked
the
police
officer
for
a
push.
the
officer
determined
that,
that
was
not
going
to
work.
at
the
same
time,
noticed
that
the
defendant’s
speech
was
slurred,
his
eyes
were
glassy
and
he
noticed
a
strong
odor
of
alcohol.
this
time
the
police
officer
instructed
the
defendant
to
turn
off
the
motor
of
the
car
to
get
out,
instructed
him
that
he
was
placing
him
under
arrest
for
driving
under
the
influence
of
liquor
and
he
advised
him
on
his
rights
under
miranda.
the
defendant
at
this
point
expressed
some
concern
that
the
dawn
light
of
his
car
would
not
turn
off
and
he
was
afraid
his
battery
would
run
down.
however
he
agreed
to
accompany
the
police
officer.
they
then
walked
up
the
embankment
and
there
was
testimony
from
the
police
officer
that
the
defendant
did
stagger
but
he
walked
up
the
embankment
unassisted.
they
were
then
met
by
the
state
police
trooper,
who
agreed
to
have
the
car
drove
to
the
state
police
barracks
and
to
go
forward
and
arrange
for
a
breathalyzer
test.
when
the
defendant
and
the
arresting
officer
arrived
at
the
state
police
barracks,
the
state
trooper
again
advised
the
defendant
of
his
right
under
miranda,
he
advised
him
of
right
to
remain
silent,
a
right
to
have
an
attorney
present,
that
anything
he
said
wouldn’t
be
used
against
him
and
he
had
a
right
to
have
an
attorney
appointed.
he
further
advised
him
under
massachusetts
law
of
his
right
to
take
or
refuse
a
breathalyzer
test
and
of
the
consequences
of
refusal,
which
in
massachusetts
would
be
a
90
day
suspension
of
license.
he
further
advised
the
defendant
of
his
statutory
right
to
make
a
telephone
call
and
to
have
a
blood
test
conducted
at
his
own
expense
by
his
own
physician.
the
defendant
responded
as
to
the
breathalyzer
test
that
he
felt
he
would
loose
his
license
either
way
so
he
as
might
as
well
take
it.
he
also
indicated
that
he
wanted
to
make
some
phone
calls.
in
the
course
of
warming
up
the
breathalysing
machine,
the
defendant
placed
at
least
two
phone
calls,
both
of
which
were
apparently
in
an
attempt
to
secure
the
services
of
an
attorney
and
to
arrange
for
bail.
a
part
of
these
telephone
conversations
were
overheard
by
both
officers.
however
he
was
apparently
unsuccessful
in
retaining
the
services
of
an
attorney
at
2’o
clock
in
the
morning.
also
there
was
testimony
that
in
attempting
to
use
the
pay
telephone,
the
defendant
drop
coins
on
the
floor
and
had
difficulty
in
picking
them
up.
a
breathalyzer
test
was
administered
and
the
percentage
by
weight
of
the
alcohol
found
in
the
defendant’s
bloodstream
was
13-100.
under
massachusetts
law,
anything
over
0.10
arises
a
statutory,
rebuttable
presumption
that
one
is
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
for
the
purpose
of
driving
a
motor
vehicle.
the
state
police
trooper
described
the
defendant
during
taking
the
breathalyzer
test
and
making
the
phone
calls
as
being
in
his
opinion
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
that
he
was
bouncing
around,
that
he
was
scratching
incessantly
and
that
he
was
dropping
coins.
however
he
also
testified
he
had
no
trouble
conversing
with
the
defendant.
the
defendant
indicatedly
understood
this
rights
when
given
and
that
there
was
no
interrogation
of
the
defendant.
however
prior
to
placing
the
defendant
in
a
cell
having
completed
all
the
arrangement
procedures,
the
trooper
searched
him
and
found
a
marijuana
cigarette
in
the
breast
pocket
of
the
shirt.
he
at
that
time
felt
it
was
a
new
ball
game
and
advised
the
defendant
he
would
be
charged
with
a
possession
of
marijuana
and
again
advised
him
of
his
rights
under
miranda.
the
defendant
responded
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
at
this
particular
this
moment,
yes
your
honor.
the
defendant
said
something
to
the
effect,
‘i
don’t
think
possession
of
a
single
cigarette
is
a
crime’.
the
trooper
responded,
‘well,
do
you
have
any
more
on
your
purse
or
in
your
car’
and
the
defendant
responded,
‘yes,
i
have
more
in
my
vehicle’.
the
trooper
--
then
the
defendant
attempted
to
say
‘i
can
name
you
some
biggies,
apparently
in
reference
to
some
narcotic
dealers
and
the
state
police
trooper
said,
‘i
don’t
to
hear
anything
more
and
placed
the
defendant
in
a
holding
cell.
he
then
prepared
an
affidavit
and
an
application
for
a
search
warrant
relating
the
arrest
of
the
defendant
and
his
response
to
the
question
about
the
marijuana
cigarette,
i
want
a
cigarette.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
don’t
believe
it,
it
would
have
and
in
fact
in
this
case
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
the
trail
judge
himself
found
that
the
validity
of
the
warrant
was
based
on
the
statement
that
there
was
more
in
car,
that
they
would
not
been
enough
without
it.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
your
honor.
in
the
ordinary
courts,
there
is
provision
for
inventory.
unfortunately
the
record
in
this
case
was
never
established
that
there
was
an
inventory
procedure
at
this
particular
state
police
barracks.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
on
the
motion
to
suppress
as
to
an
inventory
and
i
really
don’t
feel
that
i
could
make
that
argument
on
basis
of
this
record,
but
there
are
cases
that
would
substantiate
an
inventory
search,
that
when
a
car
is
brought
in
and
in
the
process
of
being
impounded
–-
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
our
court
found
that
quite
relevant
because
the
police
never
indicated
that
they
would
have
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
have
not
made
that
argument
because
i
don’t
think
the
record
fairly
supports
that
argument.
if
there
had
been
evidence
that
an
inventory
was
the
normal
course
of
procedure,
then
i
would
make
that
argument,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
search
warrant
was
invalid
would
not
mitigate
against
the
believability
of
the
inventory
search.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
it
was
never
established
that
it
is
the
usual
procedure
in
the
state
police
barracks
that
we’re
dealing
with
in
this
case.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
concerning
an
inventory
search.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that’s
correct.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
right
your
honor,
that’s
absolutely
correct.
then
the
supreme
judicial
court
didn’t
rule
on
the
–
or
they
rejected
because
it
was
no
evidence.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
following
the
motion
to
suppress.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
following
the
motion
to
suppress
the
trail
judge
rule
that
the
commonwealth
could
not
sustain
or
had
not
sustained
its
"heavy
burden"
of
demonstrating
that
the
defendant
had
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
self-incrimination
right
to
counsel.
based
this
conclusion
on
three
findings.
one
that
the
defendant
had
demonstrated
a
desire
for
counsel
and
then
he
placed
two
unsuccessful
telephone
calls
to
an
attorney
that
the
trooper
did
not
require
regard
the
defendant
having
waived
his
right
to
counsel
and
that
the
defendant
was
under
the
influence
having
below
than
0.13
reading
on
the
breathalyzer
test.
however
the
court
refused
to
suppress
the
evidence
see
as
pursuant
to
the
search
warrant.
it
did
not
believe
the
supression
was
required
under
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine.
he
noted
that
miranda
did
not
preclude
use
for
all
purposes
of
evidence
taken
in
violation
of
one
of
its
safeguards
and
then
there
would
be
no
deterrent
affect
of
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
instance
where
the
police
have
been
scrupulous
in
their
efforts
to
obey
miranda
and
that
there
was
actually
no
actual
coercion
involved.
the
supreme
judicial
court
reversed
treating
the
miranda
violation
as
a
violation
of
constitutional
guarantees.
the
court
held
that
statements
therefore
could
not
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
probable
cause
for
the
--
a
search
warrant;
for
to
do
so
reasoned
the
court
would
imply
judicial
sanction
of
the
initial
violation.
the
commonwealth
submits
that
that
court
below
in
reaching
this
conclusion
has
read
much
too
broadly
the
exclusionary
requirements
of
miranda,
but
there
is
no
constitutional
requirements
mandating
exclusion
of
statements
received
in
violation
of
miranda
for
all
purposes
and
that
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
is
not
applicable
in
this
case,
where
there
is
no
initial
constitutional
violation
and
the
application
would
have
no
deterrent
affect.
the
court
below
we
submit
has
incorrectly
and
inconsistently
with
this
court’s
more
recent
cases,
enucleated
a
violation
of
miranda
procedural
safeguards,
which
are
violation
of
protected
constitutional
rights.
the
court
below
has
interpreted
miranda
as
requiring
per
say
automatic
exclusion
of
statements
taken
in
violation
of
these
prophylactic
safe
guards
for
all
purposes,
such
a
position
is
not
required
by
the
constitution
we
submit
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
first,
miranda
itself
was
limited
to
the
admissibility
of
statement
in
the
cross
executions
case
in
chief.
recent
decisions
have
continued
to
apply
this
probabition,
that
is
the
statements
taken
may
not
be
admitted
in
the
case
in
chief.
however
they
have
permitted
use
of
the
statements
for
collateral
purposes,
specifically
in
harris
versus
new
york,
and
in
oregon
v.
hass.
the
statements
may
be
used
to
breach
credibility
if
they
are
otherwise
trustworthy.
in
michigan
versus
moseley,
the
court
went
one
step
further
in
rejecting
any
literal
precipitation
of
miranda,
which
would
you
--
any
statement
taken
after
a
suspect
and
votes
his
right
to
be
remain
silent
as
a
productive
compulsion
to
be
mandatorily
excluded,
even
if
the
statement
is
made
voluntarily.
rather
the
mandatory
exclusion,
the
admission
of
the
statement
on
submit
depends
on
an
examination
of
whether
a
defendant’s
right
to
cut
off
questioning
was
fruitlessly
honored.
finally
in
michigan
versus
tucker
this
court
holding
that
the
testimony
of
a
witness
discovered
as
a
result
of
the
defendant’s
statement,
which
had
been
taken
in
violation
of
miranda,
was
admissible
on
the
prosecution’s
case
in
chief,
specifically
distinguished
between
police
conduct,
which
directly
infringed
on
the
right
against
compulsively
self
incrimination
and
conduct
which
violated
only
the
prophylatic
rules.
common
law
suggests
that
certain
conclusions
may
be
inferred
from
these
decisions.
one;
the
miranda
guidelines
are
not
independent
constitutional
requirement.
two
that
all
police
interrogation
is
not
so
necessarily
and
apparently
coercive
as
to
implicate
the
fifth
amendment.
third;
the
statements
taken
in
violation
of
miranda
are
not
automatically
excludable
for
all
purposes,
provided
they
are
otherwise
trustworthy.
therefore
the
questions
becomes
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
believe
that
was
the
premise
of
the
miranda
decision
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
indeed
i
think
it
was.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
however
i
do
believe
in
my
citation
of
some
the
recent
cases
indicates
to
me
that
this
court
has
withdrawn
from
that
presumption
because
otherwise
if
we
are
to
assume
that
all
police
interrogation
is
necessarily
and
inherently
coercive,
and
that
it
involves
a
fifth
amendment.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
in
custody,
yes
your
honor.
in
custody
interrogation
is
necessarily
and
inherently
coercive
as
to
implicate
the
fifth
amendment,
then
i
would
say
it
would
be
inconsistent
for
the
court
to
hold
that
those
statements
may
be
admissible
for
certain
purposes
if
they
are
otherwise
trustworthy.
traditionally
if
something
–
if
a
statement
is
listed
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
in
the
sense
that
it’s
involuntary,
we
don’t
go
any
further,
it’s
inadmissible,
we
don’t
even
get
to
the
trustworthiness
of
the
statements.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
pardon
me.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that’s
true.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that’s
correct
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
recent
cases
in
this
court
interpreting
miranda
and
the
scope
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
miranda
have
indicated
a
willingness
to
examine
the
circumstances
and
distinguish
between
police
conduct,
which
actually
abridges
a
right,
were
this
actually
coercion,
psychological
or
physical,
were
there
are
threats,
inducements,
cajolery,
promises.
if
you
actually
examine
the
circumstances,
and
seems
to
be
to
reject
a
per
say
assumption
that
there
is
a
sufficient
coercive
power
at
work
because
of
his
total
interrogation
to
render
the
statement
inadmissible
because
it’s
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
against
compulsion
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that’s
correct
but
it’s
also
been
held
admissible
for
certain
purposes
with
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that’s
correct
but
the
fact
that
the
violation
of
miranda
your
honor
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
in
one
sentence
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
recent
decisions
wouldn’t
have
come
out
the
way
they
have
which
admitted
statements
for
some
purposes
which
have
been
taken
in
violation
of
miranda
because
of
the
lack
of
a
warning
in
some
instance,
like
of
a
waiver.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that’s
right
and
they
would
not
be
admissible
for
any
purpose
if
they
were
coerced.
but
the
simple
fact
that
they
were
in
taken
in
violation
of
miranda,
did
not
lead
this
court
to
a
conclusion
that
they
were
coerced
without
something
more.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that’s
correct
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
court
ruled
that
there
was
an
violation
of
the
waiver
requirement.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
challenge,
i
think
that
the
court
just
review
the
challenge.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
even
if,
yes,
oh
yes
your
honor,
even
if
they
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
don’t
think
that
the
finding
was
constitutionally
required
your
honor,
you’re
absolutely
correct
that
there
was
a
lack
of
knowing
an
intelligent
waiver
on
this
part.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
your
honor.
there
is
a
violation
of
the
waiver
provision,
which
requires
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
was
on
two
basis.
the
indication
he
had
wanted
a
lawyer,
and
the
fact
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
alcohol.
it
was
not
on
the
basis
and
nor
did
the
state
court
find
although
my
colleague
has
suggested
that
the
statement
was
involuntary,
neither
the
state
court
findings
of
fact
would
support
in
finding
of
involuntariness,
nor
does
the
supreme
judicial
court
make
any
further
findings
which
support
our
finding
of
involuntariness.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
would
i
feel
it’s
inadmissible?
no
your
honor,
i
would
not.
i
think
the
fact
that
he
was
under
the
influence
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
but
mere
being
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
is
not
a
determinate
factor
in
deciding
whether
a
statement
is
voluntary
or
not.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
your
honor.
i
think
it
should
be
a
factor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t.
i
also
would
like
to
make
the
distinction
in
massachusetts,
between
being
under
the
influence
for
the
purposes
of
driving
an
automobile
and
being
intoxicated.
in
this
case,
we
don’t
have
any
evidence
of
intoxication.
we
have
evidence
only
of
being
under
the
influence
and
having
certain
mode
or
responses
affected
a
spatial
responses
affected,
but
it’s
not,
say
a
townsend
versus
sain
situation
where
the
defendant
has
been
injected
with
truth
serum,
which
clearly
is
going
to
operate
on
the
faculty
by
which
he
determines,
whether
or
not
to
make
the
statement.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no
your
honor,
i
would
say
not.
in
this
instance,
he
never
or
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
advised
the
police
officers
that
he
wanted
an
attorney
present
before
there
was
any
interrogation.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
and
that
would
appear
to
be
for
the
purposes
of
making
bail,
since
there
was
no
interrogation
conducted
at
all
in
relation
to
the
original
charge
of
driving
under
the
influence,
i
don’t
see
why
the
police
should
have
suspected
that
he
wanted
an
attorney
present
in
a
non-existent
interrogation.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
i
do
believe
that
that
would
make
a
difference
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
here
he
only
indicated
he
want
to
make
a
phone
call,
he
never
indicated
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
don’t
believe
that
the
record
would
support
that
your
honor.
in
escobedo
situation,
i’d
suggest
it’s
entirely
different
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
situation
here
--
there
the
counsel
was
present
at
the
police
station,
the
defendant
requested
to
speak
with
his
counsel,
the
counsel
requested
to
speak
with
him,
and
the
police
firmly
denied
those
requests.
here
the
police
officer
never
cut
off
his
authority
to
make
the
phone
calls.
he
made
no
attempt
to
interrogate
him
and
in
fact
the
only
question,
if
you
can
even
call
that
an
interrogation,
came
on
a
separate
charge
after
a
new
set
of
warnings
had
been
given.
it
was
in
response
to
a
conversation
initiated
by
the
defendant
himself.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
well,
he
may
have
been
interested
but
he
may
have
felt
that
any
interrogation
of
the
defendant
at
that
time
would
be
improper.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
your
honor,
the
defendant
was
not
drunk,
the
defendant
registered
a
0.13
on
the
breathalyzer,
which
would
show
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
your
honor,
i
think
the
police
officer
was
attempting
throughout
in
the
number
of
warnings
given
and
his
whole
demeanor
to
follow
the
dictates
of
this
court
and
the
courts
of
massachusetts.
however
if
i
may
just
briefly
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
i
don’t
think
he
would
be
well
advised
to
do
that.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
why
take
the
chance
your
honor,
get
right
back
in
the
situation
here.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
if
my
view
of
the
law
is
that
-
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
your
honor
there
--
i
think
the
–
again
look
at
the
circumstances.
here
we
have
an
unintentional
violation
and
i
think
that
is
important
in
determining
whether
the
evidence
subsequently
obtained
is
actually
attainted
by
the
miranda
violation.
now
if
we
had
a
situation
where
the
police
are
going
to
violate
miranda
rules
in
the
hope
that
they
may
elicit
some
evidence
that
may
be
used
in
some
other
way,
then
i
don’t
think
that
contact
is
going
to
found
to
be
permissible,
because
there
we
have
a
dictation
of
conduct
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
he
did
your
honor
and
i
suggest
that
that
was
in
a
response,
quite
natural
response
to
a
conversation
initiated
by
the
defendant.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
well,
even
if
he
had
done
that,
would
that
render
the
evidence
more
or
less
reliable
for
uses
for
establishing
probable
cause?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
your
honor,
if
they
can
follow-up
on
the
leads
without
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
unless
there
is
some
element
of
coercion
or
trickery.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
i
am
taking
that
position.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
possible
they
could
ask
him
about
the
biggies.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
but
as
long
as
we
don’t
get
into
a
situation
where
the
police
actually
are
abusive
or
coercive
in
a
sense
that
the
statement
is
derived
in
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
in
that
sense,
then
i
would
argue
that
the
derivative
evidence
could
be
used
and
to
the
point
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
do.
may
i
reserve?
i
think
i
have
few
minutes.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
very
briefly
your
honor.
i’d
like
to
respond
to
a
question
of
justice
stevens,
prior
to
the
lunch
break
regarding
this
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
a
case.
i
would
suggest
it
under
kirby
v.
illinois
that
no
judicial
proceedings
had
been
initiated
and
the
sixth
amendment
right
does
not
apply,
this
is
not
a
brewer
v.
williams
case
in
any
respect.
as
to
the
allegation
that
there
was
an
independent
state
ground
for
this
decision,
i
would
first
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
page
70
of
the
appendix,
the
defendant's
assignment
of
error
read
as
follows.
evidence
was
obtained
as
a
violation
of
the
defendant’s
right
under
the
fourth,
fifth,
sixth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
he
did
not
assign
its
error
any
violation
under
the
constitution
of
massachusetts.
furthermore
in
the
two
reference
decisions
in
the
white
case
hass
and
hall,
there
are
references
to
federal
cases,
particularly
miranda
versus
arizona,
and
brown
versus
illinois.
in
none
of
the
referenced
cases,
in
those
two
decisions
or
in
the
reference
cases,
in
those
decisions,
there
is
any
discussion
of
the
massachusetts’s
constitution
of
probabition
against
compelled
testimony
to
take
place.
there
is
simple
no
ambiguity
in
the
basis
for
decision
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
in
the
future,
and
in
other
case,
they
could
rest
it
on
state
constitution
but
i
think
this
case
is
before
this
court
now
on
the
basis
of
this
decision
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
there
is
a
possibility
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
they
could
do
that,
they
could
do
but
they
have
given
no
indication
that
they
are
inclined
to
do
so.
in
fact
in
the
only
case
in
which
the
court
has
been
answered
to
apply
our
constitution
more
strictly
than
this
court
in
a
miranda
related
situation,
they
refused
to
say
that
our
constitution
required
a
different
holding
than
this
court
reached
in
harris
versus
new
york.
thank
you
very
much.
