e.

hear
arguments
next
in
1715,
secretary
of
public
welfare
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
noble,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
excuse
me,
mr.
watkins,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what's
the
source
of
these
supplemental
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
did
they
come
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
remand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
child
initiate
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
going
to
describe
the
situation
that
is
to
the
retarded
now,
what
about
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
extent
is
the
state
of
pennsylvania
regulate
the
private
institutions,
do
they
just
license
them,
do
they
inspect
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ferleger?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
pennsylvania
doesn't
provide
habeas
relief
or
confinement
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
your
own
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
she
know
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
can
be
an
expert
on
it,
on
retardation
per
se
but
how
does
that
give
you
a
basis
for
an
opinion
that
most
or
great
many
parents
do
what
she
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
want
to
get
the
expert
first.
how
does
the
expert
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
children
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
another
alternative
that
the
parent
might
just
be
uninformed
and
confused,
not
evil
in
any
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
since
there's
so
much
talk
about
less
restrictive
measures,
aren't
there
less
restrictive
measures
to
inform
the
parents
about
these
things
in
holding
a
full
scale
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
counseling
by
the
family
guidance
counselors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what's
the
advocates
function
here
under
your
theory?
is
this
function
to
help
the
doctors
decide
what's
best?
the
doctors
and
the
parents
decide
what's
best
for
the
child
or
its
his
this
function
to
keep
the
child
out
of
confinement
at
all
cost?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
normally
the
function
of
an
advocate,
isn't
it
when
he
is
confronted
with
a
confinement
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
so
now
the
advocate
is
stepping
into
the
position
of
the
medical
advisor,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
is
helping
to
decide,
you
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
at
1
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven't
talked
yet
counsel
about
whether
the
net
effect,
the
ultimate
effect
of
this
might
be
more
damaging
the
children
to
take
them
through
this
gaunt
of
an
adversary
proceeding
in
which
the
very
procedure
itself
puts
them
in
opposition
to
their
parents.
and
of
course
where
the
serious
emotional
condition,
they
may
already
be
in
that
posture.
question
is
what
evidences
are
here
if
any
in
the
record
about
whether
that
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
children?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
evidence?
i
know
that
the
finding
was.
i'm
wondering,
i
want
to
know
what
the
evidences
to
support
that
finding
or
whether
that's
just
conjecture
on
the
part
of
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
presence
of
the
child
by
the
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
within
this
context
as
a
child
what
capacity
does
the
child
got
to
evaluate
whether
he
or
she
should
take
part
from
this
affair
or
should
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
you
get
to
this
point
in
this
kind
of
another
premise,
you
would
have
decided
that
the
parents
are
not
to
make
the
decision.
that's
a
given
factor
here,
isn't
it.
but
the
parents
are
not
to
make
this
decision
unilaterally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
no.
having
taken
the
parents
out
of
the
decision-making
process
then
some
doctors
have
presumably
advise
certain
treatment
and
certain
procedures.
and
to
go
to
a
hearing,
we're
taking
them
out
at
least
temporarily.
taking
them
out
until
it
has
been
subjected
to
an
advisory
proceeding
of
inquiry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
their
decision
isn't
going
to
control,
the
decision
of
the
parents
is
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
mean
the
physical
presence
obviously.
the
parents
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
decide
this.
now
then
the
doctors
who'd
been
counseling
the
family.
they
aren't
going
to
be
able
to
decide
that
alone.
now
you
appoint
on
advocates.
and
let's
say
the
advocate
looks
at
the
whole
situation
over
and
then
he
decides
what's
best
for
the
children,
isn't
that
making
the
advocate
virtually
the
judge
on
the
many
aspects?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
you
giving
the
advocate
here
a
greater
role
and
you're
giving
either
the
parents
or
the
medical
advisor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
do
agree
that
the
advocate
becomes
in
this
setting
a
very
important
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
these
standards
to
assure
that
he
knows
something
about
the
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
advocate
then
is
a
different
fellow
from
this
trained
mental
health
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
lost
me.
you've
just
been
describing
two
people.
you
said
that
a
trained
mental
health
person
and
the
lawyer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
person
a
sort
of
ombudsman
for
the
retarded?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
watkins
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
