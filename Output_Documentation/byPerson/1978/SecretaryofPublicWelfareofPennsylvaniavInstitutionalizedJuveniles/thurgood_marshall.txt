how
would
a
10-year-old
child
go
about
getting
a
guardian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
a
10-year-old
apply
to
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
how
would
a
child,
10-year-old
child
go
about
applying
to
a
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
it
first
have
to
know
where
the
court
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
a
question
was
asked
earlier,
how
many
other
case
have
you
had
like
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
world.
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
i
mean
a
10-year-old
child
doesn't
know
about
legal
proceedings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
a
10-year-old
child
know
what
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
the
child
know
whether
he
is
being
treated
properly
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
10-year-old.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
wouldn't
most
of
the
child's
friend
be
10-year-old?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
no
smarter
than
he
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
other
cases
of
that
beautiful
advocate
filed
in
pennsylvania?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
cases
like
this
had
been
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
world.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
does
the
argument
hold
in
any
case
come
up
here
involved
in
incarceration
without
due
process
to
say,
“well,
you
can
remedy
that
by
habeas.”
you
don't
want
us
to
establish
that
principle,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
want
to
say
that
the
state
can
put
anybody
in
jail
if
he
allows
him
to
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
say
doctors,
you
mean
just
the
doctor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
--
you
don't
mean
a
psychiatrist.
you
just
have
to
be
a
doctor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
they
have
to
be
more
than
just
a
doctor.
could
obstetrician
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
a
child
was
found
in
an
institution
and
the
parents
didn't
know
where
the
child
was
and
found
the
child
in
an
institution
of
pennsylvania,
there's
no
way
that
parent
could
get
that
child?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
didn't
know
and
then
eventually
they
did
find
out,
that
the
child
was
in
institution
a,
is
there
no
way
that
parent
could
get
that
child
out
of
that?
there
are
no
proceedings
in
pennsylvania
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
just
don't
believe
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
some
sort
of
habeas?
