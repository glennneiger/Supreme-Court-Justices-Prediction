what
contests
does
pennsylvania
held
that
the
child
may
do
so
over
the
objection
of
his
parents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
the
court
ever
held
that
he
may
do
so
over
the
objection
of
his
parent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
parent
can
waive
any
--
if
the
parent
can
waive
all
the
child's
rights,
why
couldn't
the
parent
waive
the
right
to
bring
this
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
watkins,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
procedure
maybe
they're
from
the
record
but
the
individuals
who
make
the
determination
that
the
child
is
in
need
of
care
or
treatment
if
i
forget
the
statutory
language
and
also
the
people
who
make
the
annual
review
under
the
statute.
are
they
full
time
staff
members
or
there
some
part-time
people
who
were
also
in
private
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
be
full
time
employees
at
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
general
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
know
how
many
of
those
people
have
to
be
doctors,
mds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
must
be
--
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ferleger,
before
you
leave
the
first
point,
why
isn't
the
language
of
subparagraph
a
quote
on
page
5
broaden
up
to
cover
a
child's
petition?
subparagraph
b
just
talks
about
the
grounds
he
may
allege.
i
don't
think
b
is
exclusive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh!
i
see.
i
see
but
the
language
of
a
would
seem
to
cover
any
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ferleger,
i
just
don't
mean
to
pursue
it
but
you
started
your
argument
on
that
point
and
the
jurisdiction
restrictions
in
the
c
relate
the
petition's
filed
under
subsection
b
both
of
them,
and
i
was
asking
you
about
one
filed
under
subsection
a
and
there's
nothing
in
c
that
limit
the
venue
of
jurisdiction
of
such
a
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
saying
then
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
in
any
court
to
bring
a
proceeding
pursuant
to
subparagraph
a?
it
seems
to
me
unlikely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
court
that
holds
that
the
way
to
read
subsection
a
as
a
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
regard
to
the
mentally
retarded
after
remand,
only
one
expert
testified
for
the
plaintiffs.
the
defendants
put
on
absolutely
no
testimony
or
evidence
regarding
the
retarded
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ferleger,
before
you
sit
down,
just
roughly
how
many
of
these
applications
of
commitment
are
there
in
per
year,
something
like
that?
how
big
the
problem,
are
we
talking
about
administratively?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
in
pennsylvania.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
many
people
would
be
required
to
do
the
--
how
many
such
people
would
as
i
assume
that
they
probably
develop
a
list
but
(voice
overlap).
