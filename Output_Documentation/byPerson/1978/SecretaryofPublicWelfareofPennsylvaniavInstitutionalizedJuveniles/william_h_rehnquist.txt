justice
william
h.
rehnquist
presuming
the
district
court,
the
source
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
frankly,
it
couldn't
be
anywhere
else.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
not
necessary
just
confine
to
mental
institutions,
that
could
be
in
a
hospital
where
you
placed
for
treatment
for
a
physical
medicine
problem,
could
have
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
interrupt
you
for
a
moment.
if
your
critical
element
is
the
potential
conflict
of
interest,
and
that's
what
distinguishes
it
from
physical
treatment,
why
shouldn't
the
factual
inquiry
that
you
proposed
under
the
lower
court
said
was
referred
by
a
counsel
be
limited
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
in
fact
a
conflict
of
interest
between
the
parents
and
the
children
rather
than
this
elaborate
findings
whether
the
child
is
or
is
not
mentally
treatable,
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
i'm
asking
you
is
why
shouldn't
it
be
limited
to
that
inquiry,
not
whether
it
should
result
in
that
inquiry
inter
alia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
fact
is
clearly
erroneous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
potential
for
deprivation
of
liberty
that
calls
into
existence
the
right
to
have
an
advocate
in
the
first
place,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
that
all
and
much
different
than
to
defend
a
lawyer
for
a
defendant
and
a
criminal
case
advised
and
the
client
to
plead
guilty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
unbiased
tribunal
necessarily
judicial
when
it
is
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
right
of
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
opinion
as
to
the
constitutional
requirement
of
an
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
you'll
be
constitutionally
required?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
appeal
as
well
your
initial
hearing?
