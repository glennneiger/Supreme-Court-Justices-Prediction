mr.
david
ferleger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
correcting
a
number
of
errors
in
mr.
watkins
presentation.
first,
the
habeas
corpus
statute
in
pennsylvania
page
6
of
his
brief
indicates
that
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
habeas
cases
only
when
the
person
has
been
committed
by
a
court
or
by
a
two-doctor
medical
certificate
but
that
statute
has
been
declared
unconstitutional.
if
a
child
could
get
into
court
under
habeas,
i
believe
the
statute
would
require
the
court
to
reject
that
petition.
secondly,
under
the
states
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
habeas
corpus
statute
with
regard
to
mental
patients
is
at
pages
5
and
6
of
the
brief
and
that
--
mr.
david
ferleger
of
mr.
watkins
brief,
the
blue
colored
brief
and
that
gives
jurisdiction
and
venue
on
a
several
courts
of
the
commonwealth
for
petitions
in
sections
1,
2,
and
3
indicate
that
it
has
to
be
a
place
where
a
court
has
ordered
the
commitment.
for
the
mentally
retarded,
i
want
to
note
that
as
mr.
justice
marshall
raised,
the
states
regulations
permit
the
retarded
to
be
committed
--
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
b
is
not
all
exclusive.
i'm
talking
about
c
which
is
the
jurisdictional
section
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
language
of
a
is
more
general
but
when
we
get
to
see
which
gives
where
courts
have
jurisdiction,
i
believe
that
that
would
exclude
juveniles.
mr.
david
ferleger
if
the
child
didn't,
if
the
parent
did
not
know
where
the
child
was?
mr.
david
ferleger
there
aren't
so
far
as
i
know.
i
think
that
the
parent
--
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
i
think
that
the
parent
might
be
able
to
file
some
sort
of
mandamus
or
other
position.
mr.
david
ferleger
right.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
read
the
separate
sections
of
the
statute
is
the
one
section
of
the
mental
health
law
that
they
are
and
the
no
jurisdiction
is
conferred
on
any
court
for
any
kind
of
voluntary
--
mr.
david
ferleger
so
far
as
i
know
and
i
don't
believe
there's
any
--
mr.
david
ferleger
that
testimony
was
that
whether
or
not
children
find
themselves
in
mental
institutions
is
circumstantial,
that
parents
were
subjected
to
great
community
practice
--
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
the
expert
was
familiar
with
pennsylvania
facilities.
mr.
david
ferleger
it
was
linda
glenn
who
is
the
commissioner
of
mental
retardation
for
the
state
of
massachusetts.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
right
and
she
had
toured
institutions
and
facilities
in
pennsylvania
and
was
familiar
with
the
conditions
in
those
facilities.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
how
would
she
know
--
mr.
david
ferleger
linda
glenn
is
an
expert
and
we
stipulate
to
be
an
expert
on
retardation
and
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
district
court
found
that
parents
often
institutionalized
their
children
for
(voice
overlap)
all
reasons.
mr.
david
ferleger
she
knows,
i
believe
from
her
experience
working
with
retarded
persons,
working
with
families
of
the
retarded
and
being
aware
of
the
need
of
those
families
for
assistance.
for
example,
exhibit
1
of
the
defendants
and
application
for
a
commitment
to
an
institution
lists
31
community
services.
and
asks
whether
the
parent
knew
or
didn't
know
that
they
exist
and
which
ones
have
been
used.the
mother
of
gina
s.
wrote,
“i
don't
anything
about
these
services.”
parents
as
well
as
the
children
need
some
process,
some
system
for
dealing
with
their
own
emotional
conflicts,
their
own
lack
of
knowledge
of
alternatives
to
institutionalization.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
children
and
adults,
both.
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
they
don't
always
know
but
--
mr.
david
ferleger
they
may
often
not
know.
they
have
the
opportunity
however
to
make
decisions
on
their
own
about
their
own
rights
and
what
rights
they
want
to
waive
or
give
up.
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
the
children
do
not
in
this
situation
because
there
is
no
one
with
no
conflict
of
interests
to
help
protect
their
interests.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
there
are
neglect
and
dependency
laws
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
with
regard
to
the
commitment
of
children,
mentally
retarded
or
mentally
ill.
it's
the
feelings
of
the
experts
both
--
with
regard
to
both
classes
that
a
process
by
which
the
child
has
an
advocate
and
all
the
facts
and
considerations
can
be
aired.
that
that
process
just
like
the
abortion
process
perhaps
in
bellotti
versus
baird,
that
process
is
most
likely
to
lead
to
the
best
resolution
of
the
problems
of
the
child.
mr.
david
ferleger
we're
dealing
with
the
parent's
veto
of
the
child's
constitutionally
protected
interest
and
liberty.
the
parent
is
--
and
that
is
why
it's
similar
in
my
view
to
the
danforth
situation.
i
think
we
have
to
--
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
just
the
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
similarities
that
in
danforth,
what
the
parent
was
vetoing
was
the
child's
assertion
of
a
constitutional
right.
in
the
mental
healthcare
--
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
the
mental
--
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
but
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
liberty
implicated
in
mental
institutionalization
as
the
court
found
in
o'connor
versus
donaldson.
the
constitutional
right
here
is
the
right
to
liberty
and
to
be
free
from
the
inherent
deprivations
of
liberty
in
institutionalization.
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
i
wanted
to
respond
to
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
may
have
some
difference
with
mr.
cromarty
with
regard
to
the
coerciveness
factor.
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
determinant
factor
here.
as
the
district
court
found,
page
1077
in
the
appendix
of
the
opinion,
what
we
have
here
is
not
only
the
stigma
of
mental
illness,
not
only
the
chance
of
error,
not
only
the
greater
potential
for
long
term
loss
of
liberty.
but
we
also
have
the
conflict
or
divergence
of
interest
between
the
parents
and
the
child
that
is
not
present
when
there
are
other
medical
treatments
going
on.
we
also
have
the
need
here
to
consider
a
vast
variety
of
non-medical
considerations.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
that
the
process
order
by
the
lower
court
will
result
to
large
extent
in
that
inquiry
because
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
full
hearing
that
the
lower
court
described,
the
right
to
confrontation
and
presence
of
personal
unless
waive
those
rights
even
the
right
to
counsel
would
not
come
into
place
unless
the
advocate
for
the
child
is
independent
party
who
could
look
at
that
issue,
decided
not
to
waive
the
hearing
or
unless
the
child
would
confidently
decide
not
to
waive.
mr.
david
ferleger
in
our
case
the
neutral
decision
maker
would
have
to
accept
of
reject
the
waiver.
what
the
court
found
is
that
because
of
the
potentially
and
the
factually
found
divergences
of
interest
between
the
parents
and
the
children,
you
need
to
put
somebody
else
in
the
place
of
the
parent
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
that
waiver
issue--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
court
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
there
is
no
challenge
by
the
defendants
that
that
fact
is
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
parents
often
commit
children
for
reasons
unrelated
to
the
needs
of
the
children.
mr.
david
ferleger
not
necessarily.
mr.
david
ferleger
he
may
be
a
parent
who
is
unaware
of
alternatives.
he
may
be
a
parent
who
is
pressured
by
neighbors
or
community
into
committing
the
child.
the
parent
is
--
mr.
david
ferleger
not
necessarily.
i
think
that
there
are
--
mr.
david
ferleger
yes,
it
would.
if
the
problem
was
pressures
from
outside
unrelated
to
--
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
there
might
be
situations
where
the
parent
would
need
the
help,
would
need
the
knowledge,
would
need
the
assistance
of
experts
in
order
to
deal
with
those
problems.
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
i
--
definitely
mr.
chief
justice.
what
the
experts
found
in
our
case
and
what
the
court
found
is
a
fact
that
the
process
that
was
mandated
can
help
parents
deal
with
those
sorts
of
issues.
the
process
would
not
harm
treatment
for
the
child.
the
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
--
mr.
david
ferleger
there
are
in
the
court
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
district
court
does
not
require
that
a
full
hearing
be
held
in
any
case.
the
district
court
says,
“a
number
of
times
that
they
expect
that
hearings
won't
be
required
in
those
cases
because
in
many
cases
there
will
be
agreement
between
the
parent
and
the
child,
that
the
child
needs
to
go
into
the
hospital.”
in
many
cases
especially
once
an
advocate
gets
involved
for
the
child,
things
will
be
worked
out
so
that
there
is
not
need
to
insist
on
it
here.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
don't
believe
the
advocate's
function
is
to
keep
the
child
out
of
confinement
at
all
cost.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
often
the
function
of
an
advocate.
i
don't
know
if
that
is
--
mr.
david
ferleger
yes,
having
represented
a
children
and
adults
in
commitment
hearings,
what
you
often
find
is
a
situation
where
it's
clear
that
some
kind
of
help
needs
to
be
imposed
at
that
point
i
believe
the
function
of
the
advocate
is
to
try
to
work
out
the
best
least
restrictive
--
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
reason
is
a
very
important
one
that
the
advocate
is
not
becoming
a
medical
officer.
medical
officers
are
not
presumptively
mistrusted
in
my
view
and
the
district
court's
view.
in
a
commitment
to
a
mental
hospital,
there
are
important
non-medical
considerations
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
the
recommendation
of
a
psychiatrist
even
if
the
company
by
the
kind
of
detailed
report
that
was
required
in
specht
versus
patterson
does
not
take
care
of
the
social
interest
consideration
of
the
school,
the
community,
the
child's
friends,
the
child's
relatives,
all
the
kind
of
background
that
is
non-medical
that
must
be
considered,
that
the
court
held
must
be
considered
in
gagnon,
in
the
parole
or
probationers
verification.
the
doctor
can
make
a
recommendation
for
the
medical
factors,
psychologists
perhaps
for
the
retarded
because
a
doctor
is
not
required
in
retardation
because
it's
not
a
medical
problem.
but
the
doctor
cannot
make
the
kinds
of
social
judgments.
it's
about
depriving
a
person
liberty.
and
in
my
view
and
in
the
tradition
of
american
law
and
pennsylvania
law
in
particular,
commitments
to
mental
hospitals
are
very
different
from
other
kinds
of
medically
recommended
treatment.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
earliest
institution
i
believe
was
built
in
1751
in
united
states
but
there
were
very
few
until
the
mid-1800s.
and
as
the
payment
of
being,
the
courts
in
pennsylvania
as
i
indicate
in
my
brief
made
it
very
clear
that
whether
it's
commitment
to
a
private
or
public
institution,
a
guardian
does
not
have
that
power.
and
a
number
of
early
cases,
people
who
have
been
appointed
guardians
of
mentally
ill
or
mentally
retarded
individuals
attempted
to
commit
their
wards
to
a
mental
hospital.
and
the
court
said,
“you
cannot
do
that.
the
power
of
a
guardian
does
not
extend
to
confinement
in
an
institution.”
mr.
david
ferleger
actually
the
first
commitment
in
1676
which
occurred
in
pennsylvania,
the
first
commitment
on
record
that
i
know
of
involved
the
father
petitioning
to
colonial
court
in
pennsylvania
for
the
commitment
of
his
son.
and
the
court
ordered
that
a
blockhouse
be
built
and
that
his
son
be
confined
in
that
blockhouse.
in
pennsylvania,
it
wasn't
until
1966
when
the
statute
challenge
and
this
case
was
passed.
the
parents
had
the
right
to
indefinitely
commit
their
children
to
mental
institutions.
mr.
david
ferleger
certainly.
not
until
1966
when
the
statute
challenged
before
and
today
and
this
case
was
passed,
that
parents
have
the
power
to
indefinitely
sign
their
children
into
mental
institutions.
mr.
david
ferleger
in
pennsylvania.
pennsylvania
from
the
beginning
treated
mental
commitment
as
far
different
from
any
other
kind.
mr.
david
ferleger
for
the
mentally
retarded,
sworn
affidavits
were
required
and
there
was
an
application
procedure
that
required
doctors
to
submit
something
to
a
magistrate
or
a
judge
for
the
mentally
ill
back
a
while
that
the
procedures
changed
over
the
years.
the
first
hint
of
the
voluntary
commitment
by
parents
came
in
1961
when
the
legislature
allowed
parents
to
sign
their
children
in
for
up
to
30
days
after
which
a
court
commitment
was
required.
so,
there
has
always
been
in
pennsylvania
a
balancing
between
the
individual's
interest
and
the
parent's
interest,
with
the
parent
only
getting
this
awesome
power
not
more
than
12
years
ago.
mr.
david
ferleger
thank
you.
mr.
david
ferleger
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
speak
to
two
issues
that
came
up
earlier
then
refer
briefly
to
several
other
issues
that
i
believe
are
important.
first,
the
general
issue
in
this
case
is
how
to
protect
children,
people
who
were
likely
not
be
able
to
protect
themselves
when
their
parents
maybe
unable
either
by
inclination
or
by
information
or
lack
of
information
to
protect
them.
it's
my
view
that
that
the
procedures
ordered
by
the
lower
court
are
a
process
for
determining
whether
the
parents
interest,
the
parents
decision
coincides
with
what
the
needs
of
the
children
are.
so,
in
effect
we
do
have
a
process
by
which
that
determination
weeding
out
the
proper
decisions
by
parents
from
the
improper
decisions,
a
process
by
which
that
can
be
done.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
in
its
opinion
at
page
1081
to
1082.
mr.
david
ferleger
it's
not
conjecture
on
the
part
of
the
court.
it's
based
on
the
testimony
of
eight
psychiatrists,
four
for
each
side
in
the
first
case
and
the
testimony
on
the
retarded
uncontradicted
of
commissioner
glenn.
that
a
hearing
would
not
be
traumatizing,
that
there'd
be
little
trauma
if
at
all
and
if
there
would
be
any
trauma
of
course
the
presence
of
the
hearing
can
be
waived.
the
tribunal
can
approve
a
waiver
of
the
presence
--
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
if
the
child
is
able,
the
decision
would
be
the
child.
if
the
child
is
unable
within
the
confines
of
the
canons
of
ethics
as
mr.
cromarty
referred
to,
the
waiver
would
be
made
by
the
counsel
or
advocate
with
the
approval
of
the
tribunal.
the
other
question
mr.
chief
justice
you
raised
earlier
on
the
role
of
counsel
in
this
hearings,
over
the
lunch
break
we
read
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
and
the
lower
court
opinion
makes
it
very
clear
in
footnote
47,
page
1079,
that
the
advocate
has
to
protect
the
child's
interest
rather
than
the
all
or
nothing
get
the
child
out
of
the
institution.
the
function
of
the
advocate
according
to
the
lower
court
is
to
advance
the
child's
best
interest.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes
it
is.
the
experts
indicate
and
i
believe
the
record
is
clear
that
when
you're
thinking
about
institutionalizing
someone,
you
end
up
weighing
the
risks
and
the
harms
that
are
inherent
in
every
institutionalization
against
the
potential
benefits.
and
the
advocate
would
have
a
responsibility
for
advocating
whatever
the
best
interest
the
child
would
be
and
that's
--
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
a
lawyer
in
certain
criminal
case
probably
has
the
obligation
to
advise
the
client
to
plead
guilty
or
not.
however,
in
the
criminal
area
i
think
that
there
is
more
of
an
obligation
to
avoid
the
criminal
sanctions
than
the
lower
court
put
on
the
advocate
here.
the
responsibilities
placed
on
the
advocate
here
i
think
the
fact
that
the
lower
court
isn't
required
in
counsel
indicates
that
it's
more
of
a
best
interest
test
rather
than
looking
one
way
advocacy
kind
of
thing.
mr.
david
ferleger
not
unilaterally.
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
we're
not
taking
the
parents
out.
we're
not
taking
the
doctor's
out.
we're
bringing
them
together.
mr.
david
ferleger
not.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
case
would
be
presented
to
the
neutral
tribunal
which
would
have
to
approve
any
waiver
of
the
hearing.
that
could
be
if
anyone
agreed,
if
the
child,
parents,
doctors,
advocate
and
all
agreed
that
it
was
best
for
the
child
to
be
institutionalized,
there
wouldn't
be
a
need
for
any
full-time
hearing
at
all.
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
because
the
unbiased
tribunal
has
to
confirm
any
waiver
of
any
rights.
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
not
at
all.
the
lower
court
made
it
very
clear
that
it
was
not
determining
what
sort
of
tribunal
it
has
to
be,
simply
neutral
and
unbiased.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
lower
court
did
not
discuss
any
right
of
appeal.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
state
when
this
court
asked
it
to
give
its
views
on
what
kind
of
hearing
would
be
required,
suggested
that
in
administrative
hearing
is
subject
to
appeal
through
the
administrative
and
then
court
process
that
we
have
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
that
would
be
constitutionally
sufficient,
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
to
have
an
appeal?
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
i
don't
think
it
would.
two
other
points
first.
the
district
court's
opinion
is
very
clear
as
its
order
and
a
record
in
the
case
that
this
case
only
involves
commitment
to
institutions
not
to
group
homes,
not
to
community
care.
it
came
up
in
the
may
10,
1973
hearing.
it
came
up
in
our
motion
for
a
class
action
which
said
that
facilities
means
institutions
for
residential
treatment.
it
came
up
in
the
courts
order
specifying
that
only
evidence
relating
to
institutional
confinement
was
admissible
and
that
is
absolutely
clear.
we're
only
talking
about
in-patient
institutions
for
residential
care.one
other
matter
--
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
and
i
think
that
the
responsibilities
of
the
advocate
spelled
out
in
the
district
court's
opinion
along
with
the
waiver
provisions
and
the
neutral
tribunal's
oversight
of
the
whole
processes
--
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
the
court
requires
that
--
the
court
says
that
maybe
sufficient
to
appoint
a
guardian
trained
in
the
mental
health
field
who
would
advocate
the
child's
interest
or
alternatively
have
the
power
to
obtain
a
lawyer
to
do
so.
that
way,
you
have
the
best
of
both
worlds.
you
have
a
lawyer
available
if
it's
necessary
and
you
have
a
trained
mental
health
advocate
for
the
situations
where
you
don't
need
to
get
lawyers
involved.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
advocate
is
the
trained
mental
health
person.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
right.
the
court
said
that
it
may
not
always
be
necessary
to
appoint
a
lawyer
then
it
might
be
sufficient
if
the
state
came
up
with
a
procedure
to
appoint
a
guardian,
a
person
trained
in
the
mental
health
field
who
could
advocate
for
the
child's
rights
or
alternatively
have
the
power
to
obtain
a
lawyer.
mr.
david
ferleger
would
not
make
the
decision
on
commitment.
that
would
be
made
by
the
--
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
the
lower
court
retreated
from
its
earlier
position
that
counsel
was
required
in
every
case.
it
is
not
correct
that
three
examinations
were
made
for
each
plaintiff
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
federal
law
under
the
developmental
disabilities
act
requires
every
state
to
have
protection
and
advocacy
system
for
the
retarded.
for
the
mentally
ill,
many
states
such
as
new
jersey
which
filed
in
amicus
brief
here.
new
york
has
the
mental
health
information
service.
there
are
many
legal
and
non-legal
advocacy
groups
existing
in
the
country,
mental
health
associations,
national
association
for
private
citizens.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
--
i
myself
have
participated
on
faculty
at
various
continuing
education
kinds
of
proceedings
to
help
teach
people
--
mr.
david
ferleger
--
how
to
be
advocates
in
terms
of
the
legal
rights
of
patients.
mr.
david
ferleger
in
my
view
it
is
and
i
find
myself
spending
in
a
lot
of
those
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
basis
for
that
and
i
think
there
are
findings
prefatory
to
the
statute.
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
no,
they're
not
at
all.
it's
the
development
disabilities
act.
i
can't
remember
the
exact
section
which
describes
the
need
for
people
and
institutions
to
receive
proper
treatment,
the
least
restrictive
treatment
and
protection
of
their
rights
and
it
was
thought
--
mr.
david
ferleger
no.
every
retarded
person
whether
institutionalized
or
not
in
the
state,
a
condition
of
receiving
any
developmental
disability
funds
and
yearly
all
states
do.
mr.
david
ferleger
limited
to
retarded
and
other
developmentally
disabled.
mr.
david
ferleger
children
and
adults.
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
not
at
all
but
it
would
permit
pennsylvania
to
use
the
so-called
pna
system
protection
and
advocacy
system
to
protect
the
rights
of
these
children.
mr.
david
ferleger
it
requires
as
i
understand
it
more
individuals
based
advocacy.
it's
not
ombudsman
for
the
whole
state
one
person.
there
is
a
staff.
there
is
a
system
of
using
and
training
volunteers
as
well
as
professionals
to
provide
independent
legal
advocacy.
the
federal
statute
requires
that
the
state
mechanism
have
the
means
to
institute
legal
actions
as
well
as
simply
to
be
an
ombudsman.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
--
in
pennsylvania
--
mr.
david
ferleger
or
in
the
country?
in
pennsylvania
as
i
recall,
the
record
below
on
the
mentally
ill
when
we
had
it
from
0
to
18,
there
were
during
the
year
300
or
400
commitments
in
the
whole
state
of
pennsylvania
of
children
from
0
to
18.
nationally,
60%
of
commitments
of
children
are
children
from
15
to
17
so
we're
probably
talking
about
a
rate
of
relatively
few
commitments.
for
the
retarded,
many
institutions
in
pennsylvania
no
longer
accept
new
commitments,
institution
where
plaintiff
george
s.
has
not
accepted
any
commitments
since
1971
except
under
court
order.
as
mr.
watkins
indicated,
states
were
treating
more
and
more
from
the
use
of
institutions.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
local
public
defenders
and
legal
services
officers
many
of
which
have
specialized
mental
health
attorneys
can
easily
do
the
job.
mr.
david
ferleger
one
institution,
the
penhurst
institution
where
plaintiff
george
s.
is
confined
is
a
matter
of
their
own
policy
has
accepted
no
voluntary
commitments
since
1971.
linda
glenn
testified
that
in
massachusetts
they
have
--
mr.
david
ferleger
see,
the
issue
is
what
their
needs
are
and
pennsylvania
is
attempting
to
provide
non-institutional
community
services
because
the
question
is
not
simply,
if
you're
mentally
ill
you're
going
to
a
hospital,
if
you're
mentally
retarded
you
do.
the
question
is
what
you
need
and
is
that
an
institution?
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
right.
i
didn't
make
that
clear
enough.
thank
you.
