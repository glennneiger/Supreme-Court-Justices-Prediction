well,
under
in
pennsylvania,
will
the
pennsylvania
state
institutions
take
children
who
need
treatment
but
it
could
be
treated
at
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
parents
can't
get
to
state
just
to
warehouse
their
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
here
--
does
this
judgment
that's
under
review
here
affect
to
the
institutionalization
in
private
facilities?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
making
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
them
or
different
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
the
district
court
deal
with
that
argument
at
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
they
did
deal
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
pursuant
to
state
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
judgment
on
remand
before
or
after
the
flagg
brothers
case?
do
you
know
that
case,
flagg
brothers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
they
forbid
institutionalization
in
a
private
hospital
unless
these
procedures
are
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
basis
for
the
congressional
decision
that
requires
states
to
have
an
advocacy
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
citations
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
these
just
with
respect
to
retarded
children
and
who
are
the
wards
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
limited
to
retarded
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
this
federal
system
wouldn't
prevent
pennsylvania
from
implementing
the
system
that's
here
under
attack.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
states
doing
with
the
mentally
retarded?
what
if
pennsylvania
hasn't
accepted
this
since
1971?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
pennsylvania
doing
with
them
saying,
“no,
we
will
not
accept
them?”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
state
is
accepting
them
for
treatment,
it's
just
a
question
of
where
they
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
--
do
you
know
where
the
flagg
brothers
was
brought
to
their
attention?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
have
brought
flagg
brothers?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
that
the
district
court
was
wrong?
