mr.
norman
j.
watkins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
determination
that
two
of
pennsylvania
statutes,
which
provide
that
parents
may
voluntarily
admit
their
children
to
mental
health
or
mental
retardation
treatment
in
pennsylvania
facilities
are
unconstitutional.
the
statutes
involved,
are
first,
a
1966
act
that
provides
that
parents
of
a
mentally
retarded
child
under
the
age
of
18
may
apply
for
voluntary
admission
of
that
child
to
treatment
upon
acceptance
and
the
determination
that
the
child
is
in
fact
in
need
of
mental
retardation
therapy.
the
child
may
then
be
admitted
upon
the
application
of
the
child.
the
1976
act
provides
that
parents
of
a
mentally-ill
child
under
the
age
of
14,
upon
the
application
of
the
parent
and
upon
the
determination
of
a
psychiatrist
or
physician
of
the
need
for
treatment
may
consent
to
the
voluntary
treatment
of
that
child.
furthermore,
under
the
1966
act,
pennsylvania
promulgated
regulations
that
require
--
and
this
deals
with
the
mentally
retarded
again
that
require
not
one
but
two
independent
medical
determinations
that
the
child
is
in
fact
retarded
and
requires
the
treatment
which
has
been
recommended.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
and
there
are
12
of
them,
nine
of
whom
are
mentally
ill
and
three
mentally
retarded,
all
were
admitted
upon
application
of
their
parent
or
guardian
or
one
standing
in
loco
parentis.
eight
were
in
fact
admitted
by
their
parents
and
four
were
admitted
by
childcare
agencies
in
as
much
as
they
were
for
one
reason
or
another
words
of
the
state.
each
of
these
children,
and
this
is
typical,
have
had,
and
the
record
shows
this,
a
minimum
of
three
independent
medical
evaluations
indicating
the
need
for
the
treatment
for
which
about
which
they
were
receiving.
furthermore,
not
one
of
these
appellees
nor
any
members
of
the
class
involved
--
strike
that.
not
one
of
these
appellees
sought
to
terminate
that
treatment
by
way
of
any
of
existing
court
procedures
of
which
they
may
avail
themselves
from
moment
one
after
the
admission.
furthermore,
as
we
stand
here,
some
of
the
appellees
remain
in
the
treatment
setting
and
there
is
no
proceed
--
there
are
no
proceedings
underway
in
state
court
to
terminate
that
treatment.
nevertheless,
the
plaintiff's
brought
this
challenge
primarily
and
exclusively
on
the
due
process
clause
asserting
that
prior
to
the
effectuation
of
the
admission,
the
children
had
a
right
to
counsel
and
the
full
panoply
of
due
process.
the
lower
court
agreeing
with
the
plaintiff's
ordered
essentially
two
hearings.
first,
what
was
called
a
probable
cause
hearing
at
which
it
would
be
determined
if
in
fact
the
child
--
if
in
fact
there
was
probable
cause
in
the
courts
or
the
tribunals
view
to
believe
that
the
child
was
mentally
ill
or
retarded
and
whether
or
not
the
medically
recommended
treatment
was
in
fact
advisable.
within
two
weeks
of
that
hearing,
assuming
affirmative
findings
on
both
counts,
the
tribunal
would
convene
a
full
adversary
proceeding
at
which
the
findings
required
are
whether
in
fact
the
child
is
mentally
ill
or
retarded
and
whether
in
fact
the
treatment
which
has
been
medically
recommended
is
approved
by
the
court
or
tribunal.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
initially,
this
case
has
been
here
before.
initially
the
lower
court
required
judicial
hearings.
this
order
was
slightly
amended
to
allow
the
state
to
provide
neutral
trib
--
an
independent
neutral
tribunal.
however,
it
should
be
noted
that
this
tribunal
must
have
the
authority
to
protect
the
child's
rights
which
are
specified
by
the
order
to
cross-examination
to
present
testimony
and
furthermore
to
approve
a
waiver
of
this
significant
constitutional
right
which
the
child
has
been
given
by
the
lower
court's
order.
so,
i
would
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
not
at
this
time,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
also
that
the
court's
modifications
as
to
the
tribunal
and
counsel,
that
the
requirement
of
counsel
has
been
substituted
by
a
requirement
for
a
trained
advocate.
however,
once
again,
this
trained
advocate
must
be
able
to
vouchsafe
the
child's
rights
to
cross-examine,
confront
witnesses,
to
present
testimony
and
in
fact
must
be
able
to
make
the
legal
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
child
should
waive
his
rights
to
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
source
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
lower
court
modified
the
original
word
that
was
here.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
after
the
remand.
and
those
are
two
significant
modifications.
however,
as
i
relate
my
brief
the
practical
effect
of
them
is
probably
not
very
significant
in
as
much
as
the
lawyer
and
a
judge
would
talk
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
as
far
i'm
concerned,
it
would
have
to
be
the
bar.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
there
was
no
elucidation
on
that
point,
presumably
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
oh!
absolutely,
the
entire
order
is
predicated
upon
that.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
not
exist
presently,
mr.
justice
brennan
other
than
the
bar.
and
as
i
--
again,
in
order
to
waive
this
right,
which
the
trained
advocate
would
have
the
right
to
do,
i
would
suspect
that
a
lawyer
would
be
required.
there
are
two
threshold
questions
in
this
case
as
in
the
previous.
the
first
is
of
course
whether
or
not
these
children
in
these
context
posses
a
liberty
interest
which
cognizable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
my
position
that
the
lower
court
in
finding
such
a
liberty
interest
made
essentially
for
analytical
errors.
first,
without
any
evidence
whatsoever,
the
lower
court
presumed
that
in
this
context,
parents
maybe
presumptively
assumed
to
act
contrary
to
the
interest
of
their
children.
moreover,
the
court
presumed
without
any
evidence
bearing
this
out
that
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
lower
court
relied
on
this
court's
analysis
in
re
gault,
it
certainly
does
because
clearly
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
a
voluntary
or
involuntary?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
a
deprivation
of
liberty,
absolutely
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
but
it's
not
of
constitutional
significance
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
the
point
is
that
the
lower
court
by
relying
on
this
court's
decision
in
re
gault,
i
think
misperceived
the
relationships
at
stake
in
this
case.
for
example,
the
lower
court
would
like
in
the
relationship
of
a
doctor,
parent
and
child
to
the
relationship
of
prosecutor
and
defendant.
obviously
when
one
looks
at
the
relationship
between
prosecutor
and
defendant
in
the
criminal
context,
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest
from
inherent
in
that
relationship
and
it
should
be
presumed.
that
is
not
so
in
the
relationship
between
a
parent
and
child
and
between
a
doctor
and
patient
and
the
lower
court's
presumptions
to
this
effect
on
a
barren
record
should
be
overturned.
finally
and
has
been
discussed
at
great
length
in
the
prior
argument,
the
lower
court's
order
ignores
entirely
the
traditional
role
of
the
family
in
these
decisions.
obviously,
these
are
very
difficult
decisions.
nevertheless,
it's
just
these
type
of
decisions
that
we
entrust
the
family,
entrust
to
the
family
and
entrust
to
the
family
in
conjunction
with
a
physician
in
the
medical
context.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
believe
it
does
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
sense
that
when
a
parent
acts
on
behalf
of
his
child,
he
is
normally
presumed
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
child.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
but
in
as
much
as
it
voluntary,
no
additional
proceedings
are
required.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
to
the
--
that's
correct.
as
a
factual
matter,
the
question
which
first
must
be
addressed
though
is
whether
or
not
as
a
constitutional
matter,
when
parents
act
on
behalf
of
their
children
in
this
context
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
analysis
that
we
would
urge
upon
this
court
is
of
course
the
court's
analysis
that
was
used
in
mathews
versus
eldridge
whether
or
not
in
pennsylvania,
the
children
have
been
adequately
protected
throughout
the
process.
in
pennsylvania,
before
a
child
can
be
admitted
upon
the
application
of
his
parent,
there
must
be
at
least
one
and
most
times
to
medical
determination
independent
indicating
the
need
for
treatment.
moreover,
from
the
moment
the
admission
begins,
the
child
has
the
right
to
initiate
judicial
proceedings,
to
test
the
validity
of
the
treatment,
to
test
the
validity
of
the
decision
of
the
physicians
and
the
parents
and
to
test
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
entire
procedure
was
constitutional,
if
you
will.
every
issue
is
presented
in
this
case
could
well
have
presented
and
presented
through
habeas
corpus
proceedings
in
state
court.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
child
may
initiate
that
in
a
number
of
ways.
obviously,
the
child
can
initiate
it
himself
if
competent
enough
to
do
so
in
sufficient
maturity.
the
child
may
also
do
so
through
a
friend,
through
a
next
friend,
through
--
it
is
not
institutionalized
by
way
of
statute
that
the
child
is
automatically
appointed
and
advocate.
he
is
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
pennsylvania
law
is
very
clear
that
any
person
confined
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decisions
on
that
point,
but
i
think
the
statute
is
so
clear
that
it
would
not
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
because
as
i
say,
in
contra
distinction
to
the
statute
which
provides
that
a
parent
may
apply
for
admission,
the
statute
regarding
habeas
corpus
indicates
very
clearly
that
any
person
who
is
institutionalized
or
in
a
facility
may
challenge
the
basis.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
would
assume
that
if
a
child
initiated
such
a
proceeding,
the
parent's
voice
would
be
given
heavy
credence
by
the
court,
but
i
don't
think
it
will
be
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
not
normally,
but
he
may
do
through
a
next
friend.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct
or
a
guardian.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
normally,
however
that
need
not
necessarily
be
true.
a
guardian
other
than
the
parent
can
be
appointed.
that
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
apply
to
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
the
context
of
habeas
corpus,
i
assume
that
would
be
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
the
only
suggestion
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
suggest
is
that
they
would
do
so
the
same
way
they
have
done
here
and
that
is
by
happenstance
being
put
in
touch
with
the
counsel.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
pennsylvania,
none
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
none
that
i'm
aware
of,
other
than
the
proceeding
one,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct
but
i
think
the
point
that
the
proceedings
exist
is
that
if
in
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
if
in
fact
it
is
suspected
that
the
child
is
being
treated
when
he
does
not
need
to
be
treated,
anyone
can
initiate
the
proceedings.
it
need
not
be
the
child.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no
but
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
presumably
not,
but
the
point
is
that
someone
else
may.
the
child's
friend,
the
child's
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
this
case
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
child's
next
friend
was
a
very
competent
advocate.
and
i
would
assume
that
that
situation
could
exist
elsewhere.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well
there's
very
active
advocacy
program
in
pennsylvania.
i'm
not
certain
of
the
numbers;
i'm
not
certain
if
there
are
any.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
pennsylvania
courts?
i'm
not
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
pennsylvania
courts,
i
know
that
there
have
been
cases
on
behalf
of
juveniles,
numbers
of
them.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
can't
quote
you
numbers,
mr.
justice
marshall.
admittedly,
it's
difficult,
admittedly
it's
difficult
but
just
as
a
child
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
legislature
has
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
this
case,
i
would
not
concede.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely
not.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
purposes
of
that
confinement
are
manifestly
different,
however,
than
the
purposes
of
the
confinement
in
this
case.
and
i
should
point
out
that
the
confinement
which
has
been
attacked
and
adjoined
in
this
case.
the
treatment
runs
the
gambit
not
only
from
institutions
but
all
the
way
down
to
group
homes
and
small
family-like
setting.
so
that
many
of
the
arguments
which
may
or
may
not
exist
indicating
that
their
need
be
safeguards
against
such
treatment
really
do
not
apply
with
respect
to
this
court's
order.
i
would
also
urge
that
one
of
the
primary
reasons
that
we
import
or
place
importance
on
these
procedures
is
to
minimize
the
child's
admitted
interest
in
not
being
erroneously
admitted
to
a
mental
health
and
mental
retardation
facility.
i
would
suggest
that
the
record
in
this
case
as
well
as
pennsylvania
statutes
indicate
very
clearly
that
rigorous
safeguards
are
in
placed
to
assure
that
in
fact
this
medical
determination
of
the
need
for
treatment
is
appropriate
and
that
the
admission
and
the
treatment
undertaken
is
appropriate.
it's
important
to
know
that
in
pennsylvania
there
are
required
by
law
periodic
reviews
of
the
child's
treatment
program.
so,
that
if
it
turns
up
that
the
child
no
longer
needs
treatment,
by
law
the
child
must
be
discharge
from
treatment.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
is
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
pennsylvania
equates
the
two
with
respect
to
treatment
not
with
respect
to
process
for
admission
other
than
equating
an
act
of
a
parent
for
the
act
of
the
child.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely.
one
of
the
central
arguments
to
the
plaintiffs'
case
in
this
case
is
that
we
should
mistrust
the
diagnosis
of
professionals
in
the
field
of
psychiatry
and
in
the
field
of
mental
retardation.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
pennsylvania,
the
law
with
respect
to
the
mentally
ill
is
very
specific
that
they
must
be
provided
the
least
restrictive
setting
upon
which
treatment
may
be
--
where
a
treatment
maybe
afforded.
the
law
is
not
that
clear
with
respect
to
the
mentally
retarded
that
is
the
older
statute.
however,
there
are
--
it
is
the
policy
of
the
executive
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely
not.
not
only
because
of
the
legal
mandate
but
the
state
has
an
interest
in
keeping
the
roles
of
its
facilities
down.
it's
expensive
to
provide
treatment
in
pennsylvania
like
every
other
state
has
the
scarcity
of
resources.
it's
simply
it's
not
easy
to
gain
access
to
these
facilities
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
pennsylvania
--
mr.
justice
blackmun,
pennsylvania
is
making
a
strong
effort
at
lowering
the
population
of
its
facilities
and
has
done
a
great
deal
toward
that.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
resources
are
not
being
placed
in
institutions
but
rather
diverted
to
community
resources.
it's
a
long
and
arduous
task
but
at
present
time
with
that
effort
in
mind,
it's
simply
is
very
difficult
to
gain
admission
to
a
facility
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
may
have
taken
--
i
may
have
taken
liberty.
i
know
that
it
generally
referred
to
in
studies
as
a
common
national
problem
the
overuse
and
over
utilization
and
under
staffing
of
facilities
throughout
the
country.
however,
there're
maybe
states
in
far
better
shape
than
pennsylvania
in
that
respect.
the
point
that
i
was
making
is
that
lower
court's
finding
and
central
to
the
plaintiff's
case
i
think
is
a
presumptive
mistrust
of
medical
determinations
in
this
area.
and
i
suppose
that
the
mistrust
brings
a
large
part
from
the
nature
of
the
treatment
that
often
follows
a
medical
determination
in
this
area.
i
would
suggest
first
and
foremost
that
the
evidence
in
this
record
does
not
indicate
that
any
of
the
medical
evaluations
and
recommendations
for
treatment
were
in
fact
erroneous,
were
in
fact
inadvisable.
i
would
further
suggest
that
the
court
made
no
findings
to
that
effect
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
if
indeed
it
is
difficult
for
psychiatrist
and
psychologist
to
make
these
difficult
determinations,
it
probably
would
be
equally
as
difficult
for
lawyers
and
judges
to
do
so
who
were
completely
untrained
in
the
field.
it's
this
lack
of
merit
for
the
adversary
proceedings
that
is
most
troubling
to
me.
we
are
going
to
inject
into
the
diagnostic
process
a
procedure
which
had
best
is
going
to
prove
to
probably
ratify
any
unchecked
medical
opinions
that
are
offered
at
the
trial
and
if
not
it's
going
to
prove
as
a
debating
ground
for
professionals
in
the
field
and
i
question
whether
or
not
the
tribunal
would
be
qualified
to
determine
the
final
result
accurately.
it's
important
to
note
that
pennsylvania
if
there
is
disagreement
with
respect
to
the
retarded.
if
there
is
disagreement
with
between
professionals
as
to
the
admission,
the
admission
simply
does
not
take
place
and
may
not
take
place.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
with
respect
to
a
mentally
ill
child,
yes.
the
institution
must
say,
“no!”
if
treatment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
provided
that
the
professionals
do
not
determine
that
that
would
endanger
the
child.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
with
respect
to
the
mentally
ill
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
not
the
case
as
far
as
i
know.
the
determination
must
be
made
by
the
institution
independently
of
any
recommendations
that
come
to
it
that
the
child
is
in
fact
retarded
and
in
fact
needs
the
treatment
at
that
facility.
so,
that
absent
those
findings
by
the
state,
there
could
be
no
admission.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
pennsylvania,
the
mental
and
retarded
may
not
be
admitted
to
any
state
or
private
facility
without
two
independent
determinations
that
that
admission
is
required.
furthermore,
the
children
13
years
of
age
and
older
under
the
regulations
are
provided
if
they
object
in
any
way
orally
and
writing
to
the
continuation
of
the
treatment
they
automatically
provided
counsel
and
automatically
provided
what
amounts
to
an
involuntary
commitment
proceeding.
that's
for
children
13
and
over
--
children
13
and
under
is
presumed
that
they
cannot
competently
object.
a
presumption
which
i
might
add
carries
throughout
medicine
in
pennsylvania.
children
under
the
age
of
18
in
pennsylvania
unless
they
are
married
or
pregnant
or
seeking
pregnancy
services
simply
may
not
consent
to
or
withdraw
from
treatment
absent
parental
consent.
and
thus,
the
program
with
respect
to
mental
illnesses
is
very
similar.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
both
cases,
there
would
be
full
time
staff.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
yeah.
no,
there're
maybe
exceptions
to
that
but
that's
a
general
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
statute
and
regulations
require
with
respect
to
the
retarded
that
the
staff
at
the
facility
--
the
medical
staff
at
the
facility
determine
and
although
there
are
some
part-time
medical
staff
at
these
facilities,
there
are
in
every
facility,
there
is
a
body
of
full-time
medical
staff.
now,
who
does
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
how
many
have
to
be?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
the
cases
of
the
retarded,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
by
either
a
physician
or
a
psychologist
who
is
trained
in
the
area
of
medical
retardation.
with
respect
to
the
mentally
ill,
it
must
be
a
medical
determination.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
must
be
a
medical
determination.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
with
respect
to
the
mentally
retarded,
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
an
obstetrician
presumably
if
that
physician
felt
competent
to
make
this
medical
diagnosis
and
he
was
licensed
to
do
so,
he
could
make
the
diagnosis
and
it
would
be
unless
the
people
in
the
medical
people
in
our
facility
disagree
that
that
recommendation
would
be
given
credence,
yes.
the
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely,
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
same
arguments
plus
the
assertion
that
i've
made
in
my
brief
that
with
respect
to
admissions
to
private
facilities,
there's
simply
is
no
state
action.
the
state
employees
are
not
involved,
state
employees
don't
provide
the
examinations,
state
employees
in
fact
play
no
part
at
the
admission
process
and
in
fact,
the
state
receives
no
notice
necessarily
of
these
admissions.
the
only
contact
the
state
has
with
respect
to
these
and
they're
probably
over
350
private
facilities
involved.
the
only
contact
that
it
would
have
is
the
fact
that
the
legislature
has
provided
the
rules
under
which
they
are
suppose
to
provide
these
admissions.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
district
court
in
my
view
dealt
with
it
incorrectly
and
applied
the
wrong
test.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
it
simply
found
that
because
the
admissions
were
obtained
pursuant
to
state
law
and
i
believe
those
are
directional
--
pursuant
to
state
law
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
--
then
the
state
was
involved.
i
suggest
that
that
is
not
the
test
this
court
has
set
down
in
cases
such
as
flagg
brothers
and
metropolitan
edison
and
similar
cases.
so,
that
what
we
have
involved
here
so
that
we're
entirely
clear
are
not
only
the
mentally
ill
but
the
mentally
retarded
and
not
only
state
institutions
but
private
as
well
and
not
only
institutions
but
group
homes
and
community
based
treatment
facilities
as
well.
any
time,
any
parent
seeks
in-patient
psychiatric
or
mental
retardation
habilitation
services
for
his
child
in
pennsylvania
there
must
be
that
full
panoply
of
due
process
unless
those
procedures
are
waived.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
know
that
--
i
simply
just
i
don't
know.
i
can't
put
the
dates
together
at
this
particular
moment.
although
it's
clearly
was
after
metropolitan
edison,
i
think
that
the
judgment
run
the
file
of
a
test
in
that
case
as
well
or
certainly
the
court's
teachings
in
that
case.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
there
maybe
a
limited
inspection,
none
that
i'm
aware
of
and
none
that
has
been
brought
before
the
court.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
this
as
far
as
the
law
provides
merely
a
licensure
or
approval
of
the
facility
to
dispense
services.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely
not
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
the
state
law.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
there
is
no
regulatory
body
to
approve
each
admission
or
to
see
that
in
fact
that
is
followed.
one
presumes
that
these
facilities
are
following
state
law.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
pennsylvania
and
involved
in
this
case
are
a
number
of
facilities
that
bear
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
what
we
normally
have
in
mind
when
we
talk
about
mental
institutions.
facilities
that
may
indeed
be
private
schools
or
the
like
that
have
been
because
of
some
special
cadre
of
professionals
that
they
employ
have
been
approved
by
the
state
to
provide
these
services
when
necessary.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
lower
court's
order
would
require
treatment
of
all
of
those
children
as
prospective
mental
patients.
i
think
that
this
clearly
is
going
to
be
injurious
to
the
children,
it
certainly
not
going
to
be
conducive
to
the
undertaking
to
serious
undertakings,
the
serious
undertakings
that
area
taken
place
in
those
facilities.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no.
for
the
mentally
retarded,
the
recommendation
for
commitment
can
be
made
by
any
psychologist,
by
any
physician,
by
any
pediatrician
regardless
of
the
knowledge
of
that
person
of
the
needs
of
the
mentally
retarded.
for
the
mentally
ill,
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
commitment
statute
that
there'd
be
any
referral,
any
outside
examination,
any
separate
examination
by
anyone
except
the
institutions
and
the
psychiatrists.
mr.
watkins
is
incorrect
that
the
district
court
or
the
plaintiffs
have
presumed
anything
about
parents,
children,
the
conflicts
between
parents
and
children,
or
between
the
institutions
and
the
children.
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
conflicts
frequently
arise
with
regard
to
mental
institutionalization
of
children.
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
parents
often
institutionalized
their
children
for
reasons
that
are
unrelated
to
the
needs
of
those
children.
the
district
court
also
found
as
a
fact
that
the
institution
and
their
staff
have
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
but
four
points
to
make.
first,
in
response
to
two
questions
i
believe
delivered
by
mr.
justice
white,
flagg
brothers.
this
court's
opinion
in
flagg
brothers
was
decided
on
may
15th
and
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
was
rendered
on
may
25th
so
that
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
unfortunately,
my
brief
was
filed
well
before
this
court's
decision
in
flagg
brothers
and
i
don't
recall
whether
or
not
my
opponent
brought
it
to
the
court's
attention,
i
know
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
think
flagg
brothers
would
respect
to
private
license
facilities
indicates
that
there
is
no
state
action
involved.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct.
secondly,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white
you
inquired
us
to
whether
or
not
pennsylvania
inspects
these
private
facilities
and
pennsylvanian
all
requires
at
62
pertinent
statutes
911
that
an
inspection
be
conducted
at
least
annually
as
to
the
conditions
in
the
facility.
the
third
point
i
wish
to
make
is
a
clarification
of
a
question
addressed
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger
on
whether
or
not
any
of
or
what
the
basis
of
commissioner
glenn's
testimony
or
conclusions
was
with
respect
to
the
erroneous
submissions
of
children
in
pennsylvania.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
not
one
of
the
experts
that
testified
in
this
case
examined
any
of
the
children
involved
in
this
case.
and
the
record
reflects
this
very
clearly.
for
example
i
cite
2495
(a)
of
the
appendix
where
dr.
finder
candidly
admits
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
any
of
the
conditions
in
pennsylvania.
635
(a),
dr.
messenger
admits
that
the
only
thing
that
he
was
familiar
with
at
the
time
of
his
testimony
was
that
which
was
provided
by
counsel
dealing
with
the
legal
process
involved.
and
finally
1030
(a),
where
commissioner
glenn
indicated
that
her
only
familiarity
was
with
the
regulations
that
was
provided
to
her
prior
to
her
testimony.
finally,
i
would
only
submit
that
the
coverage
of
a
lower
court's
order
with
respect
to
community-based
facilities
is
clearly
addressed
in
my
reply
brief,
the
green-covered
reply
brief
and
i
defer
to
that.
thank
you
very
much.
