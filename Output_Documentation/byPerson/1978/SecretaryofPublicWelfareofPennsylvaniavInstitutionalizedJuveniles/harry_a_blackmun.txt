harry
a.

you
make
that
same
statement
in
your
brief
like
ever
other
state.
would
it
shock
you
if
i
said,
“i
know
of
a
states
where
there
is
overflow
capacity,
unused
capacity
in
state
mental
institutions.”
since
the
advent
of
the
tranquilizer?
what's
the
matter
at
pennsylvania?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'm
merely
saying
that
i
question
the
accuracy
of
your
statement
because
i
know
states
where
there
is
surplus
room
in
state
institutions.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
watkins,
i
think
we
were
told
that
in
georgia
if
the
institution
determines
that
the
child
could
better
be
treated
at
home
but
the
parents
say,
“no!”
we
simply
can't
take
care
of
the
child
at
home.
but
then,
the
institution
would
take
the
child,
are
you
telling
us
that
in
pennsylvania
in
that
situation,
the
institution
could
say
no?
the
parents
must
take
the
child
back?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
if
it
says
no
then
the
parents
must
take
the
child,
is
that
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
as
i
understand
the
hypothetical
in
the
georgia
case
was
that
the
institutions
said
that
the
child
would
be
better
off
at
home
but
the
parents
refused
to
have
the
child
at
home
saying,
“no,
too
disturbing."
we
simply
couldn't
get
on
the
child
on
that
circumstance.
the
institution
will
take
the
child.
that's
not
the
case
in
pennsylvania?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
how
about
as
to
the
retarded?
