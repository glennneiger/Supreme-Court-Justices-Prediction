justice
potter
stewart
you
say
or
tribunal,
what's
the
alternative
court?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
pennsylvania
legislature
created
such
a
tribunal?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
doesn't
really
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
there's
a
deprivation
of
liberty,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
a
voluntary
commitment
results
in
a
deprivation
of
liberty,
doesn't
it?
a
voluntary
commitment
by
an
adult
results
in
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
justice
potter
stewart
voluntary.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
better
does
reads
all
in
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
therefore
i
would
think
this
view
of
the
district
court
which
you're
attacking
has
nothing
to
do
with
basically,
or
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
these
things
you've
been
talking
about
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
there's
a
deprivation
of
liberty,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
when
an
adult
acts
on
behalf
of
himself,
he's
presumed
to
be
acting
on
behalf
on
himself.
justice
potter
stewart
in
his
best
interest.
and
when
he
voluntarily
commits
himself
to
a
hospital,
there
is
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
whatever
else
there
maybe,
there
is
that.
justice
potter
stewart
so
in
other
words,
even
if
you're
right
in
all
of
your
submissions
on
what
you've
just
been
telling
us,
there
still
remains
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it's
the
equivalent
of
a
voluntary
admission.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
point
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
a
child
under
ordinary
--
quite
apart
from
this
particular
context
or
setting,
generally
in
pennsylvania,
a
parent
speaks
for
his
child,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
wouldn't
that
also
then
presumably
be
true
in
this
context?
justice
potter
stewart
can
a
child
--
can
a
10-year-old
child
bring
a
lawsuit
in
pennsylvania
in
his
own
name?
justice
potter
stewart
through
a
next
friend.
justice
potter
stewart
and
by
the
guardian
and
not
the
guardian
in
the
absence
of
an
order
to
--
the
contrary
is
the
parent,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
or
all
the
same
procedures
equally
applicable
to
adults
who
have
voluntarily
committed
themselves?
justice
potter
stewart
pennsylvania
equates
the
two?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
that
exception
it
equates
voluntary
commitments
or
voluntary
committed?
justice
potter
stewart
for
an
adult,
they're
done
on
behalf
of
himself
or
herself.
for
a
child,
they're
done
beyond
on
behalf
of
that
child
by
his
or
her
parent?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
beyond
that
precisely
identical,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
law
requires?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
the
testimony
then?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
in
pennsylvania?
justice
potter
stewart
where
did
he
come
from?
justice
potter
stewart
she
came
from
massachusetts.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
not
talking
about
the
conditions
and
the
facilities,
we're
talking
about
how
the
children
got
there
whether
or
not
they
got
there
improperly,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
what
--
31
did
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
services
available
to
children
only?
children
only
or
children
and
adults?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
suppose
adults
would
voluntarily
commit
themselves
to
mental
institutions
know
about
all
those
alternative
services
available
before
they
do
so?
justice
potter
stewart
before
they
do
so?
justice
potter
stewart
pennsylvania
--
does
pennsylvania
have
procedures
for
the
germination
that
a
parent
is
unfit?
justice
potter
stewart
or
incompetent
as
a
parent?
justice
potter
stewart
and
because
of
neglect
of
his
child
or
mistreatment
of
this
child?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
so
there
are
plenty
of
procedures
if
there's
a
--
they
defined
a
parent
unfit
as
a
parent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
certify
that
parent
is
unfit
and
if
that
happens
to
the
child,
somebody
else
replaces
the
parent
in
that
parent's
place
and
local
place
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
unlike
bellotti
against
baird
or
the
other
case,
we're
not
dealing
here
with
a
parents
veto
of
a
child's
wish
to
have
medical
treatment,
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
in
danforth,
you
had
a
child
who
wanted
to
have
medical
procedures
and
the
question
was
whether
the
parent
could
veto
it.
here,
you
don't
have
a
child
wanting
to
be
admitted
to
the
hospital,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
the
parent
vetoing?
justice
potter
stewart
which
should
have
been
recognized
in
roe
and
doe?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
there
a
constitutional
right
not
to
have
medical
treatment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
generally
an
advocate
doesn't
make
a
decision
here.
an
advocate
is
an
advocate
and
it's
a
neutral
decision
maker
who
makes
the
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
why
our
general
issue
found
that
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
a
parent
does
that,
he's
an
unfit
parent,
isn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
a
parent
is
pressured
by
neighbors
or
community
in
the
beating
of
his
child
is
an
unfit
parent,
whatever
the
motivation
comes
from,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
he
be
removed
if
you
could
show
to
the
proper
factfinder
in
pennsylvania
the
juvenile
court
or
whatever
that
a
parent
eventually
mistreated
and
beat
his
child,
wouldn't
that
be
grounds
for
finding
him
a
neglectful
parent?
justice
potter
stewart
wherever
the
pressures
came
from.
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
historically
had
there
been
state
mental
hospitals?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
that
before
there
were
mental
hospitals,
power
of
the
guardian
to
lock
somebody
up
in
an
attic
was
unquestioned
because
that
didn't
involve
any
action
by
the
state
then
therefore
didn't
implicate
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
say
that
again?
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
in
pennsylvania.
justice
potter
stewart
and
prior
to
1966,
what
was
the
procedure
for
the
so-called
voluntary
admission
of
somebody
who
would
not
reach
