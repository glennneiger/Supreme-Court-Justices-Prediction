it's
printed.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
are
you
telling
that
there
was
no
refusal?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
do
we
have
a
case
of
controversy
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
when
he
attack
--
if
this
--
if
there
was
no
refusal
in
this
case
by
the
respondent,
as
has
been
found
by
the
magistrate
court,
why
can't
he
make
any
attack
in
the
statute
on
its
face
where
he
has
applied
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
question
presented
in
your
brief,
whether
a
statute
imposing
a
uniform
temporary
suspension
of
the
driver's
license
for
his
refusal
to
take
a
chemical
test
or
so
on?
while
as
to
due
process
clause,
where
the
uniform
suspension
was
not
imposed
in
this
case.
a
90-day
suspension
was
not
effectively
imposed,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
was
it
that
his
license
suspended
for
90
days?
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
it
wasn't
on
that
ground,
was
it?
he
got
it
back
you
just
told
us
in
28
days?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
result
of
the
finding
that
he
did
not
in
fact
refuse
to
take
the
test,
isn't
that
correct?
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
he
did
not
refuse.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
talking
about
the
massachusetts
courts
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hagopian,
if
i'm
--
unless
i
wholly
misapprehended
the
issue
on
this
case.
this
statute
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence
but
merely
about
it
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
he
refuse
or
didn't
refuse
to
take
a
breathalyzer.
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
about
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
potter
stewart
just
that
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
he
didn't
refuse
to
take
the
test
then
the
statute
is
wholly
inapplicable
to
him.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
correct,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
should
be
--
give
the
ground
upon
which
he
proposed
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
case
would
be
because
of
your
refusal
to
take
a
breathalyzer
case
in
such
and
such
a
date.
justice
potter
stewart
i.e.and
what
would
be
the
issue
be,
that
he
did
refuse?
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
minute,
would
that
be
the
only
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
be
three
issues.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
would
be
the
only
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
not
for
90
days
if
they
refuse
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test
under
the
present
act.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
massachusetts
by
enacting
this
legislation
said
there
yes,
there
is.
or
else
it
would
not
have
acted
the
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
suspension
of
license
--
justice
potter
stewart
precisely,
because
they
thought
there
was
a
need
for
it.
presumably,
they
would
have
enacted
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
that's
important
to
our
system
of
justice.
and
it
always
has
been.
i've
never
known
why
don't
we
do
away
with
trials
and
we
can
insist,
say
we'll
put
you
in
jail
before
we
give
you
a
trial
and
you
can
stay
in
there
and
then
you
can
have
your
trial.
