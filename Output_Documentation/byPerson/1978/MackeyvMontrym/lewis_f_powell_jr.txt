justice
lewis
f.
powell,

mr.
sikora,
i
missed
something.
i
hate
to
acknowledge
having
done
it,
but
you
said
if
he
had
had
the
one-day
same
day
hearing
or
may
be
appealed
brought
in
the
acquittal
on
the
drunken-driving
charge,
you
will
be
bring
his
license
back,
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
why
would
he
still
have
to
give
it
up
for
90
days
for
refusing
to
take
the
test?
i
didn't
quite
understand
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no,
no.
the
finding,
he
wasn't
driving
while
intoxicated?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
still
don't
understand
why
--
it
was
the
night
that
they
refused
to
let
him
take
it
but
he
had
still
previously
refused
to
take
himself?
i
don't
understand
why
he
still
wasn't
required
to
be
suspended
for
90
days?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
law
in
custom
is
that
when
there's
an
initial
refusal
and
then
a
request
to
take
it
and
it's
turned
down
and
then
that
vitiates
the
initial
review?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
that
happens
very
often.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
there's
a
custom
that
happens
often
enough
so
you
can
tell
us
there's
a
custom
that
happens
often
enough
so
you
can
tell
us
there's
a
custom
that
that
kind
of
finding
is
regularly
uttered
by
the
clearing
officer?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
driving
to
endanger
or
under
the
influence
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
we
just
follow
this
up
for
a
moment.
what
you're
telling
me
correctly
reflects
the
state
practice.
it
means
that
a
driver
has
a
right
when
he
comes
to
the
station
to
refuse,
wait
20
minutes
and
say,
now
i'd
like
to
take
the
exculpatory
test.
if
they
don't
give
it
to
him,
he
has
a
right,
they
can't
suspend
his
license.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
what
you're
telling
me.
it's
the
custom
as
i
understand
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
but
he
presumably
is
interpreting
the
law
of
your
statement
is
so
deciding.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
telling
me
that
as
a
matter
of
massachusetts
law
on
this
record,
there
was
no
refusal
and
that's
why
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
this
case?
there
was
no
refusal
because
there
is
a
subsequent
request
for
an
exculpatory
test
if
the
police
denied
would
vitiate
it
--
vitiated
the
initial
refusal.
so
on
this
record
there
would
not
be
a
refusal
as
a
matter
of
massachusetts
law.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
told
me
that
that
is
a
consistent
application
that
we
can
be
sure
that
the
administrator
would
have
recognized
as
the
law?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
the
--
the
question
of
when
a
refusal
takes
place
is
not
really
just
a
yes
or
no
question
on
all
circumstances.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
a
question
that's
left
entirely
the
discretion
of
the
police
under
the
--
as
a
pre-suspension
matter.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
the
answer
is
just
a
statute
resulting
to
denial
of
his
license.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
the
statute
--
is
his
license
in
the
state
of
suspension
is
still
or
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
if
they
just
arrest
him
for
speeding
and
there
was
nothing
about
and
that
suggested
one
way
or
another
on
being
drunk,
could
they
make
him
take
the
test
then?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
must
be
probable
cause
i
believe
he
was
under
the
influence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course
the
difference
is
in
dixon
against
love,
you'd
already
had
your
judicial
determination
that
may
have
violated
the
loss
over
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
statute
require
to
be
completed
in
7
to
10
days?
i
don't
find
the
statutory
description
on
the
same
day
hearing.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
7
to
10
days
results
from
the
fact
that
sometimes
there's
a
lot
time
for
the
police
officer
to
come
in
to
tell
the
other
side
of
the
story.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
i
ask
you,
rather
basically.
what
--
how
would
the
state
interest
suffer
if
instead
of
this
procedure
is
said,
it
made
a
rule
to
show
cause
so
that
you
show
up
in
five
days
or
six
days,
whatever
the
hearing
officer
offers
and
unless
you
have
good
cause
for
saying
there
was
no
refusal
or
probable
cause
of
your
license
to
be
suspended.
and
then
you
have
the
same,
everything
else
exactly
the
same.
how
would
the
state
interest
suffer
if
you
do
it
that
way?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
--
do
you
mean
they
would
refuse
the
test
because
of
the
fact
they
are
going
to
keep
the
license
for
five
days
instead
of
having
suspended
forthwith?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
but
you
say
that
you've
given
that
hope
now.
you're
given
a
hearing
except
that
the
only
difference
is
that
it's
going
to
be
suspended
definitely
for
at
least
three
or
four
days.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
why
wouldn't
it
be
equally
definite
as
far
as
the
90-day
suspension?
if
you
just
say
well,
we
won't
have
the
suspension
to
take
effect
until
it's
the
same
day
hearing.
and
most
people
i
suppose
don't
have
any
real
answer
if
they
refuse
a
review.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
immediately
in
three
days
later?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
maybe
--
the
hearing
officer
may
be
more
lenient
to
the
police
officer
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
that
was
the
whole
point
of
your
attack,
isn't
it
that
even
if
he
did
not
refuse
it,
the
police
officer
says
he
does
and
he
never
gets
a
hearing
at
the
statute
caused
him
to
lose
his
license?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
why
you
say
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
hagopian,
let
me
ask
the
question.
would
you
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
if
it
worked
in
this
way?
if
the
police
sent
a
notice
and
simultaneously
send
it
to
the
person
arrested
and
also
to
the
registrar
which
said
in
substance
in
such
and
such
a
date,
your
license
will
be
revoked,
you
may
appear
at
that
time
to
object
if
you
with
to
it,
if
you
don't
you'd
be
automatically
revoked.
would
you
have
any
objection
to
that
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
you're
really
talking
about
is
the
suspension
that
the
fact
that
there's
an
automatic
suspension
for
the
interval
of
time
between
the
notice
to
the
magistrate
and
the
time
he
can
go
in
and
demand
hearing.
do
you
say
that
would
be
alright
if
it
was
a
notice
of
what
they're
proposed
to
do
rather
than
the
facts
that
was
accorded?
