john
paul

if
the
law
provided
for
notice,
would
that
meet
your
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wait
a
minute.
would
it
need
it
or
do
you
want
something
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
else
do
you
want?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
by
custom
at
least,
if
one
knew
about
the
opportunity,
the
registrar
would
allow
him
to
appeal
until
the
state
decided
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
he
loses
license
before
the
registrar
acts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
registrar
was
the
one
who
deprived
him
of
his
license.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
registrar
gets
the
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
he's
in
the
position
to
act
unless
the
individual
tried,
appears
and
gives
him
reasons
why
that
shouldn't
be
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
custom
accorded
the
individual
a
right
to
be
heard
before
the
registrar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
still
mr.
hagopian,
i
don't
think
you
made
it
clear.
there's
a
time
interval
between
the
revocation
which
can
be
done
by
mail
and
the
turning
in
of
the
physical
piece
of
paper
which
may
be
a
few
days
later,
that's
the
later
date
he
gets
the
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
heart
of
your
case,
and
you're
not
making
it
at
all
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
also,
are
you
not
contending
that
before
he
gets
the
notice
he
has
absolutely
no
right
to
appear
before
the
magistrate
or
whatever
is
called?
that's
right.
that's
your
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
say
no
problem
if
there
was
probable
cause
for
that,
is
that
your
position?
