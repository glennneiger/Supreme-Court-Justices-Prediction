justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
dispute
the
refusal
to
take
the
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
my
understanding
from
the
record
though
i
realize
i
may
be
wrong
but
the
appellee
in
this
case
had
actually
requested
the
test
himself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
sort
of
administrative
appeal
did
he
take?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
ask
for
that
surrender
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
--
is
there
any
review
of
that
board's
findings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
superior
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
precisely
was
the
court
disposition?
the
charge
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
the
driver
had
been
denied
his
request
to
take
an
exculpatory
breathalyzer
test
within
20
minutes
after
arrival
at
the
station.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
charge?
drunken
driving?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
driving
to
endanger.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
registrar
act
in
conformity
to
the
district
court's
order
or
the
massachusetts'
court's
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
decided
on
summary
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
favor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
all
doubts
as
to
facts
have
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
state
i
take
it
and
not
it's
affidavits
and
filed
on
your
behalf
had
to
be
disbelieved.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
those
are
the
facts
then
that
we
should
go
by?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
anything
outside
the
agreed
segments
of
facts
that's
contained
only
in
an
affidavit
submitted
--
in
support
of
your
client,
we
must
treat
as
having
been
resolved
adversely
to
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
why
i
was
curious
as
to
why
you
referred
to
an
affidavit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
that
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
it
agreed
in
the
sense
that
the
state
agreed
that
that's
what
transpired
in
the
state
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
state
didn't
agree?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
we
--
what
do
we
do
if
we
disagree
with
the
district
court's
conclusion
that's
unconstitutional
on
its
face
but
think
that
you
should
have
the
right
to
assert
your
claim
that
it's
unconstitutional
as
applied?
do
we
decide
that
here
or
send
it
back?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
then
enjoin
state
officials
for
--
from
applying
the
statute.
you
just
said
they
couldn't
apply
to
montrym.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
in
16
(a)
and
it
isn't
at
all
what
you
say.
it's
says
plaintiff
purports
to
represent
a
class
consisting
of
those
persons
whose
massachusetts
license
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
has
been
suspended
by
the
defendant
or
his
predecessors
or
successors
in
office
prior
to
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
such
suspension.
person
with
a
sub-section
this
court
determines
it's
a
correct
class.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
i
take
it
at
the
time
you
filed
this
action
of
the
district
court,
montrym
had
already
had
an
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
he
went
into
the
district
court
after
he
had
had
his
opportunity
for
hearing
before
the
registrar.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
can
this
be
a
class
in
this
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
also
appealed
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
also
appealed
from
the
registrar
to
the
state
administrative?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
didn't
you
file
your
action
in
district
court
before
you
filed
your
notice
of
appeal
to
the
state
of
administrative
agency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
your
client
is
bound
by
it
as
his
previous
attorneys
that
before
he
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
opportunity
to
respond,
you
say
you
don't
want
an
evidentiary
hearing
but
you
want
an
“opportunity
to
respond.”
what
would
the
opportunity
to
respond
consist
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
you're
the
one
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
what
if
the
registrar
after
a
hearing
that
he
had
contested
all
three
of
those
by
an
affidavit
saying
the
police
were
wrong
and
all
three
said,
fine
you
can
have
your
opportunity
to
respond,
and
your
license
is
suspended.
no,
no
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
whole
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
this
court
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
judge
campbell
said,
wasn't
it
that
purpose
was
to
deter
people
from
refusing
to
take
the
breathalyzer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
you
should.
