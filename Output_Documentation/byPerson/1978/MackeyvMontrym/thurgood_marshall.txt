justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
before
you
begin,
is
this
the
only
brief
you
filed
in
this
court?
just
prove
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
sir?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
i
know
where
i
am.
now,
tell
me
the
jurisdictional
statement
until
that
time.
this
jurisdictional
statement,
is
this
all?
did
you
ever
file
a
brief?
this
is
just
a
proof
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
--
is
it
this
script
at
the
top
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
--
becuase
i
never
did
get
page
17
--
17
(a)
i
don't
have.
well,
okay,
we'll
find
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
have
the
page,
it's
incomplete.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
opinion
to
the
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
second
time,
the
state
refuse
to
give
him
the
test,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
my
brother
blackmun's
question
was
as
to
how
long
is
it
before
reading
would
not
be
any
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
the
final
judgment
in
this
case
were
52
minutes
after
the
government
said,
"we
will
give
you
the
test."
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
refused
a
test
and
as
a
result
of
that
he
lost
his
life.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
that
record
where
the
police
explained
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
not
given
the
second
time,
isn't
he?
nothing
in
the
record
on
that,
i
mean
i
couldn't
find
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
order
of
the
court
and
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
what's
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it's
your
position
that's
all
that's
all
before
us,
that's
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
that
before
us
when
you
only
are
interested
on
the
face?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
a
case,
you
are
withdrawing
anything
except
on
the
face?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
you
reserve
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
question
the
fact
that
he
--
the
state
refuse
to
give
him
the
test?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
abandon
that
point
or
not?
did
you
abandon
it
in
the
lower
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court,
the
judgment,
says
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
statement
of
facts
aside
from
the
one
of
page
28?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
was
no
word
or
any
about
breathalyzer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
it
was
all
that
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
and
i
don't
see
breathalyzer
in
here
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
it
that
it
says
what
happened
when
he
was
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
see
exhibit
a
referred
to
the
statement
of
facts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
question
as
applied
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
--
you
still
maintain
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
didn't
abandon
it
in
the
lower
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
class?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
it
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
law
of
massachusetts
says
that
if
the
state
refuses
to
give
the
man
a
breathalyzer
test,
they'll
take
his
license
and
everything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
law
does
not
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
hear
what
i
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
state
refuses
to
give
him
the
test,
he
then
loses
his
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
didn't
say
it,
but
that's
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood
that
the
state
court
said
that
this
man
was
not
--
did
not
violate
the
statute
because
it
was
the
state
and
not
here
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
is
the
state
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
else
in
the
record
other
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
in
this
court
other
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
here,
breathalyzer
refused
when
requested
within
the
half
hour
of
arrest
of
the
station,
see
affidavit
and
memorandum.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
“affidavit
and
memorandum?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
on
the
basis
of
that
it
was
dismissed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
doing
now?
he
was
dismissed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
have
wish
i
knew
what
was
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
client
had
a
lawyer.
your
client
had
his
own
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
client
had
his
own
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
does
he
need
other
notice,
he's
got
lawyer
to
tell
him
what
the
law
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
aren't
required
to
know
the
law.
i
assume
that
that's
the
law
in
massachusetts
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
lawyers
are
not
required
to
know
the
law
then
i
agree
with
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
lose
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
should
really
move
until
the
question
is
asked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
his
question
was,
could
the
registrar
relieve
him
of
his
license
immediately?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
he
refused
to
take
the
test,
the
registrar
takes
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
in
the
world
can
he
do
that?
he
is
in
an
entirely
different
city,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
what
i
mean
he
can't
do
it
unless
he
gets
the
notice,
can
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
the
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
should
wait
and
then
get
into
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
you
to
alledge
traffic
violation.
you
can't
immediately
go
before
the
magistrate?
immediately?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
are
arrested
for
violation
of
traffic
code
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
of
massachusetts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can't
you
go
directly
before
magistrate,
then
and
there
if
one
is
available?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
say
how
to
do
to
it,
you
said
you
can't
even
go
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
the
magistrate.
you
can't
go
to
the
magistrate,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
sure
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
are
you
sure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
the
magistrate
says,
i
don't
think
this
man
is
drunk
and
turns
him
loose.
he
can
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
can
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
while
if
you
say
he
could
do.
