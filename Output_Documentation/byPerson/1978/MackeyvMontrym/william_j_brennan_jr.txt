justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
about
any
time
spent
from
the
time
of
the
accident?
how
soon
would
--
from
the
time
of
the
accident
must
be
taken
to
be
effective?
do
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
police
will
delay
long
enough
to
let
the
driver
call
an
attorney
and
ask
for
advice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
it
be
a
refusal
for
example
for
driver
to
say,
"i'd
like
to
call
my
lawyer
before
i
take
the
test,"
then
say
maybe
take
25
minutes
talking
with
lawyer
on
the
phone
then
come
back
and
say,
"yes
i'll
take
it"
and
could
the
police
officer
then
say,
"it's
too
late
now,
you've
already
refused?
what,
what
--
w
ould
that
be
refusal
or
not?
in
--
i
would
say
that
that
hypothetical
would
not
be
a
refusal.
it
would
not
be
refusal.
i
think
it
would
be
an
accommodation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
pretty
much
what
happened
here,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
just
say,
well,
i
don't
want
to
do
it
till
i
talk
to
my
lawyer,
and
it
takes
25
minutes
to
get
the
legal
advice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
if
it
takes
25
minutes
to
get
legal
advice
that's
a
refusal?
i
would
think
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
the
board's
decision
on
the
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
because
this
lawsuit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
mean
asking
if
he
questioned.
but
you
said
he'd
been
acquitted
for
other
reason
of
the
drunken-driving
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
have
result
at
almost
automatically
in
the
administrative
appeal
was
holding
in
the
restoration
of
his
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
preferred
just
to
be
a
hero
on
the
lawsuit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
knockout
the
statute
lock,
stock
and
barrel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
a
man
could
be
driving
with
a
license
as
been
suspended
even
though
it's
still
in
his
possession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
district
court
ordered
the
reinstatement
at
the
end
of
that
so
that
he
got
to
pack
it
28
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
issue
i
gather
on
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
next
party
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
was
ordered
the
return
it
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
there
about
the
appellee's
conduct
at
the
time
of
the
accident
that
prompted
the
officers
to
say
you
should
take
a
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
does
the
statute
require
some
kind
of
probable
cause
before
the
officer
may
require
and
suggest
that
he
take
the
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
what
i
mean,
must
it
--
must
it
be
something
in
the
way
of
the
showing
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
under
the
influence
of
driving
to
endanger
or
something
in
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
offenses
charged
here
were
related
to
victim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
to
connect
it
with
the
accident
was
only.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
driving
to
endanger
is
not
only
an
offense
as
i
know
of
massachusetts
for
driving
while
under
the
influence.
when
you
drive
to
endanger
another
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
true.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
gather
really
the
state's
argument
here
is
certainly
he
is
entitled
to
due
process
when
he
gets
it
all
since
he
--
in
order
to
beyond
probable
cause
in
the
first
instance.
and
then
he
may
take
an
administrative
appeal
and
get
a
trial
de
novo
and
meanwhile
his
license
may
be
suspended
but
he
is
entitled
to
a
complete
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
within
the
reasonable
ground.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
all
adds
up,
you
submit
to
upon
the
due
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
soon
can
he
get
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
notice
of
suspension
tells
him
what?
as
to
the
day
of
surrender?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
and
what
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
fix
the
day
just
as
suppose
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
does
he
get
the
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
--
