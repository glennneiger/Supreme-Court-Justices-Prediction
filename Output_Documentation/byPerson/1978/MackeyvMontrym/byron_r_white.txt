justice
byron

white
or
he
could
--
either
that
or
you
couldn't
arrest
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
must
be
a
valid
arrest
for
driving
under
the
influence.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
witness
has
required
that
he
has
to
be
a
witness
to
the
refusal
like
he
does
and
to
the
refusal
to
take
the
test
or
to
the
behavior
at
the
time
of
the
accident?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
has
a
chance
sir
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
his
license
will
be
suspended?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
thought
also
the
hearing
that
you
would
require
would
be
more
than
what
custom
here
would
afford.
you
would
want
to
be
able
to
call
any
kind
of
witness
you
wanted?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you.
suppose
you
have
all
the
hearings
that
you
wanted
before
the
suspension,
do
you
suppose
that?
and
the
registrar
says
now
you
got
all
the
hearing
you
want
and
you
say
yes
to
all
the
hearing,
i
now
find
there
is
probable
cause
to
suspend
your
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
want
a
full
hearing
some
other
time,
we'll
give
it
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
satisfy
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
think,
you
don't
think
then
just
a
police
report
furnishes
probable
cause
to
suspend
the
license
even
for
a
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
little
more
than
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
it
is,
most
probable
cause
of
termination
to
ex
parte?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
suggesting
to
you
that
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
important
probable
cause
if
terminations
that
involved
loss
of
liberty
that
are
made
ex
parte
and
made
only
by
one
person
in
writing.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
deprive
a
person
of
liberty
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
not
property
ex
parte?
that's
a
--
that's
a
client
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
hunting
around,
a
little
i'm
sure
i
could
find
--
