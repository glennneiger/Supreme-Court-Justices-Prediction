the
case

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
mackey
against

mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.

apparently,
it
didn't
reach
some
of
us.
chief

burger
we'll
make
inquiry
also
but
we
do,
perhaps,
need
that
page
which
is
missing
from
all
of
the
copies
here.
chief

e.
burger
very
well,
we'll
pursue
it.
mr.
sikora,
you
may
proceed.
chief

he
refer
--
he
refused
first
and
then
about
50
minutes
later
asked
for
it,
wasn't
that?

chief

but
it's
50
minutes
after
the
event.
chief

warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
that
it
is
a
medical
matter
or
scientific
matter
that
it
might
make
a
difference
not
only
in
the
lapse
of
time
but
rather
even
to
have
a
plaintiff
bourbon
or
a
quarter
bourbon
or
only
two
ounces
of
bourbon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
two
ounces
reasonably
might,
the
manifestations
of
two
ounces
might
disappear
from
the
bloodstream
much
more
quickly
than
a
plaintiff
would?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps,
we'll
ask
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
we'll
not
ask
you
to
fragment
your
argument.
we
will
have
you
ready
to
go
on
at
1
o'clock.

mr.
hagopian,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
calculated
on
the
record,
it
is
precisely
30
minutes
but
it
doesn't
make
all
that
difference.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
had
taken
a
copy
of
this
dismissal
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
he
did
do
that,
for
the
first
hearing
that
it
was
available
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they're
bound
to
it,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
bound
to
know
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
must
have
changed
that
ancient
action
of
the
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
we
should
do
away
with
oral
argument.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
