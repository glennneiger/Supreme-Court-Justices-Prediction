mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
good
afternoon,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
initially
to
straighten
out
some
of
the
facts
in
this
case
before
proceeding
to
my
argument.
first
of
all,
mr.
montrym
was
stopped
at
8:30
a.m.
on
the
evening
in
question
and
he
was
brought
to
the
police
station
at
8:45
at
that
time
he
refused
the
breathalyzer.
his
attorney
showed
up
5
or
10
minutes
later
and
at
9:05,
he
alleges
in
his
affidavit
that
he
wanted
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test
which
was
at
the
most
35
minutes
from
the
time
of
the
accident
and
approximately
20
minutes
from
his
initial
refusal.
now,
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor.
but
there
was
some
talk
about
52
minutes
here
when
my
brother
was
up
here
this
morning
and
i
want
to
clarify.
that
clearly
is
out
of
question
from
the
time
of
the
accident
not
the
time
when
he
was
first
asked
about
the
breathalyzer
test.
there
are
statutes
and
other
jurisdictions
that
hold
up
to
30
minutes
from
the
time
that
the
person
has
read
his
rights
and
clearly,
montrym
was
within
that
because
at
least
according
to
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
judge.
that's
the
first
point
that
i
wanted
to
clarify.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
your
honor.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
man
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
oh!
no,
your
honor.
we
still
reserve
as
applied.
i
mean
it's
conceivable
to
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
when
we
brought
our
original
motion
for
summary
judgment,
i
believe
we
asked
the
court
to
examine
both
questions
the
issue
of
constitutionality
on
its
face
because
it
was
a
class
action
and
as
applied
to
mr.
montrym.
there
was
a
case
last
term
that
was
handed
down
by
this
court
that
held,
if
the
man
doesn't
at
least
colorably
assert
a
claim
of
innocence,
the
fact
that
is
procedural
due
process
rights
have
violated
is
not
an
independent
claim.
that
was
a
per
curiam
opinion
and
i
don't
know
what
the
implications
are
of
that
opinion
but
we
want
to
clearly
assert
that
mr.
montrym
was
innocent.
he
is
asserting
the
claim
of
innocence
here
in
this
particular
case.
he
was
an
innocent
man
and
that's
what
the
due
process
clauses
point.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
he
was
refused
that
state
did.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
he
initially
refused.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct
your
honor.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
montrym's
case
is
irrelevant
at
least
on
the
facial
attack.
it's
irrelevant
other
than
the
fact
that
he
has
search
a
claim
of
innocence.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
whether
he
was
innocent
or
not
is
irrelevant.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
when
i
say
innocent,
i
didn't
mean
innocent
of
the
substance
of
crime.
i
meant
innocent
of
the
fact
that
he
didn't
refuse.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
corr
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct,
yes
it
is.
well,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i'm
not
--
excuse
me,
i
take
that
back
your
honor.
no,
that's
not
true
because
the
police
officer
alleged.
when
the
police
officer
sends
the
report
to
the
registry,
that's
what
creates
the
cause
of
action
in
this
case.
the
police
officer
asserted
that
he
refused
to
take
the
test
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct,
except
to
the
extent
that
there
was
an
agreed
statement
of
facts
that
was
filed
by
parties
and
that's
in
the
appendix
and
that's
quite
extensive.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
were
any
at
all
of
this
affidavits
outside
of
the
agreed
statement
of
facts.
i
don't
believe
there
were
any
affidavits.
i
think
that's
correct
but
there
were
none
so
that
the
case
was
heard
on
agreed
statement
of
facts.
at
least
the
motion
for
summary
of
judgment
was
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
the
affidavit
was
in
the
state
court
pleadings.
you
see
we've
taken
steps
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
oh!
yes,
it
was.
we
took
the
entire
record
from
the
state
court
pleadings
and
we
incorporated
that
into
the
agreed
statement
of
facts.
and
so
that
is
in
the
record
to
that
extent.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
that
certainly
was
not.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
but
they
agreed
that
the
records
--
they
agreed
that
we
have
the
record
from
the
state
court
proceedings
and
they
agreed
to
the
veracity
instead
of
submitting
certified
copies
but
there
were
affidavits
in
the
pleadings
in
the
state
courts
and
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
agreed
to
the
truth
of
the
allegations
in
the
affidavits.
but
the
certainly
agreed
to
the
fact
that
the
affidavits
were
filed,
the
state
court
record
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
in
the
state
court,
the
judge
said,
breathalyzer
refused
by
the
police
to
see
affidavit.
so
i
think
it
is
clear
inference
that
the
trial
judge
in
the
state
court
proceedings
believed
what
was
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
i
don't
believe.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
is
on
page
28.
there
are
several
exhibits
though
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
your
honor
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
if
you
look
at
exhibit
b
which
is
referred
to
in
agreed
statement
of
facts,
exhibit
b
is
on
page
33
and
that
is
the
face
of
the
complaint
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i'm
sure
exhibit
d
has
too,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
think
it's
clearly
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
montrym's
case.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
i
certainly
do.
and
i
think
it's
unconstitutional
on
its
face
also.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
absolutely
not
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
think
you
have
to
decide
as
applied
here.
well,
it's
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
so
the
worst
that
--
i
mean
conceivably
you
could
say
that
the
district
court
made
it
a
mistake
on
the
issue
of
granting
summary
judgment
and
send
it
back
that
would
not
preclude
mr.
montrym
from
either
going
forward
to
trial
even
as
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
right.
but
i
don't
think
montrym's
case,
the
district
court
held
in
the
findings
of
fact
that
montrym's
case
was
just
a
typical
of
the
class
and
my
brother's
have
not
taken
any
appeal
from
that
that
order
of
the
certifying
the
class
action
when
they
don't
seem
to
challenge
the
fact
that
the
district
court
judge
held
that
montrym's
case
was
typical
of
the
class.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
classes
of
--
it
comprises
all
those
motorists
in
massachusetts
who
have
driver's
license
who
refused
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it's
in
the
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
that's
not
correct.
he
was
never
given
an
opportunity.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
your
honor,
if
the
point
is
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
point
to
you.
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
to
you.
let
--
let
me
just
give
you
just
briefly
two
minutes
of
procedure
so
you
can
understand
what
the
problem
is
here.
when
the
police
officer
takes
its
report,
he
sends
it
to
the
registrar.
the
registrar
automatically
revokes
his
license
and
that's
what
happened
to
montrym's
case.
montrym
surrendered
his
license
but
he
did
not
--
but
he
insisted
that
he
always
maintained
that
the
registrar
could
not
--
that
that
suspension
was
illegal
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
granted
a
hearing
prior.
and
that's
what
the
class
constitutes.
all
those
people
who
the
registrar
sends
a
notice
to,
suspends
their
license
without
giving
him
that
hearing
first.
and
that's
the
central
issue
in
this
case.
he
insists
upon
that
hearing
first.
as
it
turned
out
your
honors,
the
registrar
was
well-informed
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
attorney
that
represented
mr.
montrym
in
the
district
court,
mr.
harris
who
is
here
with
me
today,
he
sent
the
registrar
before
the
registrar
have
sent
the
notice
to
montrym
as
a
copy
of
the
district
court
judgment
and
he
said
mr.
montrym
never
refused
to
take
the
breathalyzer.
here's
the
finding
of
fact
from
the
district
court
when
the
district
court
in
massachusetts
criminal
court
has
ruled
that
montrym
did
not
refuse
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test.
you
should
not
take
his
license
and
i'm
sending
you
this
letter
to
avert
his
license
revocation
and
the
registrar
just
totally
ignored
that.
and
he
says,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
have
no
discretion
under
the
statute,
when
i
get
this
notice
from
the
police
department
that's
as
montrym
refuses,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
suspend
the
license
and
that's
it.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
interested
in
anything
else.
you
want
to
come
in
and
talk
to
me
afterwards,
i'll
be
very
happy
to
talk
to
you
about
it.
this
is
so
happens
even
after
he
suspended
the
license.
i
sent
him
a
demand
and
demanded
the
return
of
that
license
and
sent
him
the
district
court
and
i
explained
to
him
about
the
breathalyzer
so
he
well
knew
the
facts
even
after
that
stage
but
he
refused
to
return
that
license.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
the
only
time
he
returned
to
this
when
the
united
states
district
court
ordered
him
to
and
then
it
took
him
seven
days
to
return
after
the
date
of
the
order.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that
was,
--
that
was
--
that's
right.
that
was
on
the
initial
decision
to
suspend
his
license
that
was
on
appeal
taken
but
it
would
take
30
days
before
we
could
even
get
a
hearing
and
we
worked
around
the
clock
to
even
get
that
which
would
mean
that
one-third
of
the
90
days
suspension
period
would
be
completely
expired
before
he
could
even
get
a
hearing
on
that
issue.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
wasn't
involved
in
the
cases,
i
believe
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
i
understand
that
your
honor
but
the
going
through
the
board
of
appeals
was
an
exercise
in
futility.
on
the
initial
decision,
they
have
no
discretion,
they
probably
who
have
upheld
the
registrar
anyway
because
that's
what
the
statute
says
whether
they
have
the
power
to
determine
the
constitutional
challenge
of
that
stage
of
the
game
is
not
clear
on
massachusetts
law.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct,
your
honor,
90
days.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it
says
that
if
the
motorist
refuses
to
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
i
stand
corrected,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
your
honor.
that's
not
correct.
the
statute
says
if
the
motorist
refuses
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test
and
if
he
has
been
validly
arrested
if
there
was
probable
cause
for
his
arrest
and
if
in
fact
he
refused
to
take
the
breathalyzer,
he
must
prove
all
three
elements
and
they
are
complicated
elements,
your
honor.
then
--
if
and
only
then
that
the
state
has
that
right
to
take
his
license.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
don't
think
that's
true
your
honor.
what
the
state
court
held
was
they
dismissed
the
complaints.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
the
only
thing
in
the
state
court
that's
in
the
record
in
the
appendix,
your
honor,
which
is
on
page
33.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it's
not
on
the
state
court
record,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
none.
and
by
the
way,
your
honor,
that
reference
to
exhibit
b
is
made
on
page
28
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
the
affidavit
is
on
pages
38,
39
of
the
appendix.
and
that's
the
affidavit
that
montrym
submitted
in
the
district
court
and
i
submit
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
the
judgment
may
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
right.
but
that
decision
isn't
binding
upon
the
registrar.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
he
did
for
that
first
hearing.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
he
sent
and
it's
stipulated
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts,
your
honor
that
the
record
in
the
district
court
proceedings
was
sent
to
the
registrar
before
he
revoked
mr.
montrym's
license
and
the
registrar
totally
ignored
it
and
in
fact
he
wrote
back
--
well,
mr.
harris
sent
him
a
copy
of
the
district
court
record.
he
wrote
mr.
harris
back
five
days
after
he
in
fact
had
revoked
mr.
montrym's
license
and
that
letter
is
on
page
46
of
the
--
48,
page
48
of
the
appendix
in
reference
to
a
letter
of
june
2nd
concerning
the
above-named,
this
is
to
advise
you
that
his
license
has
already
been
suspended
and
said
license
must
be
returned
to
this
office
immediately.
registrar's
position
is
quite
clear,
your
honor,
in
this
case
that
when
he
gets
that
letter
from
the
police
department
saying
that
a
motorist
has
refused
to
take
the
breathalyzer,
he
has
absolutely
no
discretion
but
to
revoke
the
license
upon
receipt
of
that
letter
and
that
is
the
issue,
the
district
court's
findings
not
binding
upon
the
registrar.
the
district
court
may
have
dismissed
this
case
for
number
of
reasons.
he
happens
to
make
those
specifics
findings
of
facts.
he
may
construe
the
statute
different
in
the
registrar.
there's
no
massachusetts
case
law
on
this
particular
issue.
he
may
construe
the
statute
differently.
he
may
disagree
with
the
district
court
judge.
i
don't
know
whether
the
district
court
judge
was
right
or
whether
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you,
your
honor,
that
this
morning
the
notice
of
revocation
that
was
sent
to
mr.
montrym
which
was
standard
form
by
the
registrar
says
you
must
cease
operating
your
motor
vehicle
immediately.
there's
nothing
in
that
notice
which
is
in
the
appendix
that
advises
the
motorist
that
he
has
a
right
to
an
immediate
hearing.
and
i
do
concede
as
in
the
agreed
statement
that
he
can
as
a
practical
manner
walk
in
the
registry
and
get
an
immediate
hearing.
but
he's
not
notified
of
that
in
the
notice
that
goes
out
to
the
motorist
and
the
copy
of
that
notice
is
on
page
44-45.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
he
knew.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
don't
even
know
if
he's
own
counsel
knew
about
that
fact,
your
honor.
there's
nothing
in
the
registry
regulations
that
publishes
that
you
can
get
an
immediate
hearing.
as
a
practical
manner,
mr.
harris
sent
a
letter
immediately
to
the
registry
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
i
don't
believe.
i
don't
--
the
right
to
an
immediate
hearing
is
not
your
honor
part
of
the
law
that
is
something
by
custom
that
the
registry
gives.
i
know
of
no
regulations,
written
regulations
that
ever
promulgated
to
that
effect.
as
a
practical
matter,
if
you
have
any
experience
with
the
registry
as
an
attorney
you
would
know
that.
i
know
that
and
i
knew
it.
but
i
don't
know
that
all
lawyers
who
live
in
the
country
know
that.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
are
they
bound
to
know
that?
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
it's
a
custom
your
honor,
i
don't,
you
know
i
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
it
certainly
would
help,
no.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
i
want
something
else
besides
that.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
think
they're
going
to
give
the
hearing
before
they
take
the
license.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
but
why
should
he
lose
his
license
first
your
honor?
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
right.
that's
the
bottom
line
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
he
does
but
--
and
i'm
saying
that
he
should
have
a
hearing
before
the
registrar
takes
that
action.
what
he
--
what
the
registrar
should
does
that
he
does
in
hundreds
of
other
cases,
your
honor,
pursuant
to
statutory
scheme
in
massachusetts
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
he
does
in
fact
take
his
license
immediately.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct.
as
soon
as
he
gets
the
letter
from
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
he
sends
a
notice
as
soon
as
he
gets
the
notice
from
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
know
by
statute,
he
is
required
to
act,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
after
the
revocation,
after
the
notice
goes
out
then
he
by
custom
he
can
get
an
immediate
hearing
but
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
right
and
he
can't
drive
in
the
meantime
either
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes
the
--
he
cannot
drive,
the
minute
he
gets
the
notice,
he
has
to
cease
and
desist.
he
then
physically
has
to
get
that
notice
to
the
registrar.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct,
your
honor,
has
absolutely
no
right.
and
if,
even
he
does
which
is
what
happened
to
montrym's
case
through
his
attorney,
the
registrar
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
him
because
the
registrar
has
no
discretion
under
the
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that
question.
you
mean
before
the
registrar
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
right.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
you
mean
to
trial,
your
honor
on
the
criminal
charges?
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
you
can't
go
to
the
registrar.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
we
can
go
to
a
lower
court
and
criminal
court,
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
the
issue
of
whether
he
takes
the
breathalyzer
will
not
usually
come
up
in
that
proceedings
--
in
the
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
because
it's
inadmissible
as
grants
for
mistrial
for
fact
that
the
police
introduced
the
fact
that
he
refused
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
but
the
registrar
will
still
revoke
his
license.
even
if
he's
found
not
guilty
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
i
understand
that.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
let
me
say
in
general
your
honor,
the
criminal
proceedings
do
not
come
before
the
registry
action.
this
is
an
unusual
case
in
that
sense.
usually,
the
criminal
proceedings
come
after
the
registry
revokes
so
this
is
a
rare
case
to
have
a
criminal
proceeding
before
the
registrar
takes
his
action.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
in
fact
that's
a
procedure
that
you
can
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct
and
that
procedure
is
inexistence
in
massachusetts
by
the
registry
in
several
other
statutes.
and
i
pointed
that
out
in
my
brief.
he
sends
a
14-day
notice
and
he
says
i
intend
to
revoke
your
license
in
14
days
and
if
you
object
to
it,
you
can
come
in
and
have
a
hearing
before
the
14
days.
and
that
procedure
is
used
in
thousands
of
cases.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
oh!
yes,
yes
he
does.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
don't
take
that
position,
your
honor.
i
just
think
that
that
i
don't
even
take
the
position
he
has
to
have
a
hearing
before
the
registry.
he's
got
an
opportunity
to
respond
in
some
way,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
right.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it
certainly
would.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
really
the
heart
of
the
issue
to
due
process
clause.
there
must
be
some
interaction
with
the
citizen
himself.
you've
got
the
dignicy
interest
and
the
representative
interest.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it
must
be
covered
by
the
due
process
clause
and
that's
totally
absent.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
have
resolved
that
issue.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
certainly
think
he
has
an
opportunity.
he
should
have
the
opportunity
to
file
an
affidavit
to
respond
with
charges
in
writing.
that's
an
absolute
minimum.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
right.
exactly
and
if
he
files
an
affidavit
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
because
there's
three
other
issues
under
the
statutes
before
the
registry
can
revoke.
he
must
show
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
initial
arrest.
he
must
show
that
there
was
a
valid
arrest.
and
that
involves
whether
he
was
on
a
public
way
and
multitude
of
other
factors.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
three
issues
that
massachusetts
sets
out
as
a
basis
for
the
revocation.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
they've
got
--
they've
got
to
find
that
this
is
at
least
the
prima
facie
evidence
that
the
government
has
met
there
burden
improving
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
suppose
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
well,
no.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
in
criminal
proceedings
your
honor
that
may
be
true.
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
that
issue
of
the
search
warrant
is
distinguished
in
fuentes
versus
shevin
and
that's
a
criminal
proceedings.
and
i
also
believe
it
was
distinguish
more
recently
in
a
case
last
term
which
i
think
you
took
the
majority
opinion
on
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
in
a
criminal
sense,
yes.
in
a
civil
sense,
i
know
of
no
thing
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
--
that
the
court
has
ever
held
were
an
ex
parte
that
could
be
a
deprivation
of
a
property
interest
in
the
civil
sense.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
not
in
--
in
a
criminal
sense,
yes.
in
a
civil
sense,
no.
i
know
of
no
case
that
this
court
has
held
other
if
there
is
an
emergency
doctrine
where
there
could
be
an
ex
parte
and
that's
the
issue,
an
ex
parte
deprivation
of
property
or
liberty
in
the
civil
sense.
leaving
the
criminal
side
if
the
law
reside;
in
the
civil
sense,
i
know
of
no
case
this
court
has
ever
held
absolute
emergency
condition
that
there
could
be
an
ex
parte
deprivation.even
on
an
affidavit,
i
know
of
no
case
that
this
court
has
ever
held
to
that.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
know
that
there
are
number
of
old
cases.
i
just
like
to
say
one
last
thing,
your
honor.
the
state
has
absolutely
no
interest
in
taking
this
immediately
taking
this
drunks
off
of
the
road,
your
honor
under
the
procedure
in
massachusetts
now
everybody
whose
drunk
95%
are
now
going
a
rehabilitative
program
after
they
convicted
they
are
still
on
the
road.
why
is
it?
what
justification
is
there
for
the
state
to
take
away
that
man's
right
to
some
hearing
before
the
state
takes
--
the
registry
takes
any
action
if
in
fact,
after
even
if
they
are
drunk
and
are
all
convicted
they
are
all
on
the
road
anyway,
your
honor.
there
is
no
legitimate
state
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is,
is
there
any
immediate
reason
to
take
to
impose
that
90-day
sanction.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
submit
to
you,
your
honor
that
they
have
enacted
it
because
they
feel
that
instant
punishment.
the
metering
out
of
instant
punishment
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
--
is
a
deterrent
for
people
who
refuse
to
take
the
breathalyzer.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
don't
think
that
deters
crime.
i
don't
think
that
--
