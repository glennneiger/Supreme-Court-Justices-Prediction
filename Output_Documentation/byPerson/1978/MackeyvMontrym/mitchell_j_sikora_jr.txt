your

mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
at
a
lost,
your
honor.
here
is
our
jurisdictional
statement
printed.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
sir.
it's
a
regular
printed
paper.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
apologize
to
the
court.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes.
i
apologize,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
will
investigate
the
problem
and
supply
the
court
with
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
this
isn't
the
--
what
we
have
here
as
printed.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
actually
a
jurisdictional
statement.
i
know
and
plus
i
apologize.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
procedural
due
process
case.
it
arises
from
a
section
1983
class
action
challenge
to
the
massachusetts
implied
consent
highway
safety
law.
it
comes
to
this
court
on
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court,
holding
that
law
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
implied
consent
laws
enforced
in
all
50
states
typically
provide
that
a
person
arrested
upon
a
charge
of
drunken
driving
must
submit
to
a
chemical
or
breath
analysis
test
or
else
accept
a
temporary
license
suspension
for
his
refusal
of
that
test.
the
general
question
presented
today
is
whether
the
states
must
provide
a
driver
with
the
hearing
at
which
he
can
dispute
the
fact
of
his
refusal
prior
to
the
suspension
of
his
license.
after
describing
the
operation
of
the
massachusetts
law
and
the
particular
facts,
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
he
requested
it
subsequent
to
refusing
it
upon
his
arrival
initially,
at
the
station.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
about
22
minutes
later,
he
asked
for
it.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct,
52
minutes
after
the
accident,
22
minutes
after
the
arrival
at
the
station.
the
police
did
refuse
it.
his
attorney
at
the
interim
had
arrived
at
the
station
and
had
consulted
with
a
driver
and
apparently
there
was
a
change
of
mind.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it's
hard
to
say,
your
honor.
some
states
have
suggested
that
30
minutes
is
reasonable
block
of
time
from
the
arrival
at
the
station
house.
however,
since
that
would
vary
according
to
the
time
that
is
taken
to
get
to
the
station
house
from
the
scene
of
the
accident,
it's
very
difficult
to
say
at
least
with
any
scientific
knowledge
what
time
spent
renders
the
test
ineffective
or
inaccurate.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
don't.
in
this
case
it
was
as
we've
said,
52
minutes
from
the
approximate
time
of
the
accident.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
the
police
officers
apparently
made
a
judgment
that
the
time
spent
now
between
the
moment
of
arrest
and
the
moment
of
request
had
become
too
long
for
an
accurate
reading.
that
at
least
was
their
subjective
judgment.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
don't
think
we
can
say
with
any
scientific
objectivity
to
the
court
that
are
with
any
information
from
the
record
that
we
know
of
a
precise
time.
it
does
appear
that
the
police
in
this
case
in
their
judgment
made
a
judgment
call
that
52
minutes
was
too
long.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
52
minutes
after
the
accident,
the
police
refused
the
test.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
they
had
originally
offered
it
30
minutes
after
the
test
and
he
refused.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
the
record
does
not,
your
honor.
i
would
think
again
that
there's
any
irreducible
amount
of
police
discretion
if
an
attorney
arrives
soon
after
an
individual
came
to
the
station,
chances
might
be
better.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
he
outright
refused
the
test
at
first.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
see.
i
--
i
think
the
key
factor
is
always
going
to
be
the
length
of
time
between
the
accidents.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
my
instinct
is
just
to
agree
with
that
assessment,
your
honor.
and
perhaps
if
that
is
one
more
good
reason
for
a
drawing
heart
and
bright
lines
in
this
situation
and
perhaps
having
time
limits,
i
must
concede
that
the
police
here
were
operating
without
hard
time
limits
and
that
they
made
a
subjective
judgment
about
the
driver's
condition
in
refusing
the
test
when
he
requested
after
52
minutes
from
the
accident
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there
is
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
and
that
bings
me
perhaps
to
one
of
the
pervasive
features
of
this
case.
the
case
would
be
a
very
respectable
as
applied
challenge
to
the
statute
because
these
facts
showed
that
at
least
the
administration
of
the
status
was
not
efficient.
however,
the
plaintiff
has
chosen
and
has
actually
forgone
opportunities
to
present
as
applied
argument
and
has
chosen
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face
saying
that
in
all
situations,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
the
performance
of
the
police
and
the
registrar
here
is
not
typical
we
submit.
the
parties
have
washed
out
in
a
statement
of
agreed
facts,
many
of
the
particular
equities
of
the
case
and
have
decided
to
focus
on
the
major
issue
of
whether
hearing
must
invariably
be
prior
rather
than
subsequent.
after
describing
the
operation
of
the
massachusetts
law
in
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
we
argue
that
the
statute
does
satisfy
due
process
under
the
court's
three
measurements
for
prior
hearing.
those
are
the
value
of
the
private
interest
taken
by
the
government,
here
a
driver's
license,
the
risk
of
the
mistaken
taking
of
the
interests
without
a
prior
hearing,
and
the
public
purpose
for
which
the
government
is
acting.
the
massachusetts
law
requires
a
police
officer
arresting
a
person
for
driving
under
the
influence
to
offer
that
person
a
chemical
breath
--
chemical
or
breath
analysis
test.
the
officer
must
inform
the
driver
that
the
refusal
of
the
test
will
result
in
a
90-day
license
suspension.
if
the
driver
still
refuses
the
test,
the
officer
must
immediately
prepare
a
written
report
of
refusal.
this
is
possibly
not
a
factor
in
the
police
reluctance
to
give
the
driver
second
chance
if
they
do
immediately
perform
their
paperwork.
they
must
at
least
throw
it
away
or
backup
and
do
the
paper
work
again.
the
police
officer
receiving
the
refusal
must
sign
it
under
the
penalties
of
perjury
and
he
must
forward
it
to
the
registrar
of
motor
vehicles
immediately.
in
turn,
the
registrar
must
impose
the
90-day
suspension
by
an
immediate
notice
directing
the
driver
to
surrender
his
license
at
a
local
registry
office.
there
is
no
discretion
left
in
the
joints
of
the
statute.
each
of
these
requirements
is
mandatory.
at
the
time
of
the
surrender,
the
driver
can
request
an
immediate
hearing
to
dispute
his
refusal
of
the
test.
that
hearing
will
begin
on
the
same
day
as
surrender
if
at
all
possible.
in
this
particular
case,
donald
montrym's
car
collided
with
a
motorcycle.
about
15
minutes
after
the
accident,
the
police
arrived,
arrested
him,
charged
him
among
other
offenses
with
driving
while
intoxicated
and
they
accompanied
him
to
the
station
house
and
at
this
point,
we
have
the
initial
refusal
an
officer
executed
the
report
of
refusal.
montrym
claims
that
his
refusal
was
not
informed.
he
says
that
he
was
not
informed
of
the
suspension
penalty
and
refused
on
that
ground.
the
remaining
facts
are
undisputed
that
the
police
did
execute
the
report
that
the
registrar
suspended
montrym,
but
subsequently
a
state
trial
court
dismissed
the
drunken-driving
charge
on
the
ground
that
the
police
had
refused
his
subsequent
request.
montrym's
attorney
informed
the
main
office
of
the
registrar
of
the
court
result.
the
registrar
answered
that
the
license
had
already
been
suspended
and
must
be
surrendered.
montrym
did
surrender
the
license
but
for
some
reason
did
not
request
a
surrender
day
hearing.
instead
he
took
an
administrative
appeal
from
the
suspension
but
before
the
completion
of
the
administrative
process
filed
the
present
class
action.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
within
10
days
from
any
action
of
the
registrar,
a
driver
may
appeal
for
a
de
novo
evidentiary
hearing
before
a
board
of
appeal
presiding
over
the
registrar's
actions,
that
board
in
turn
will
schedule
a
hearing.
and
here,
montrym
would
have
had
a
hearing
several
weeks
into
his
suspension,
one
was
scheduled
when
he
brought
this
out.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
he
did.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
review
by
the
state
trial
court
of
the
administrative
board
of
appeals
decisions.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
the
board
never
reached
it,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
we
think
so.
more
importantly,
we
think
the
same
day
hearing
would
have
had
the
same
result.
that
is
if
he
had
brought
with
him
the
court
disposition
or
certified
copy
of
the
court
disposition
to
the
surrender
day
hearing,
a
registry
hearing's
officer
would
have
immediately
reinstated
its
licenses.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
after
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
believe
my
--
i
don't
want
to
impute
motives
to
my
brother's
reason
for
bringing
the
suit.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
conceptually,
the
license
is
suspended
at
the
time
the
registrar
signs
the
notice
of
suspension
and
puts
it
in
the
mail.
typically,
it
will
arrive
within
a
day
or
two.
the
driver
is
literally
informed
that
his
license
has
been
surrendered
and
that
he
must
bring
the
surrendered
license
to
the
registry.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
the
finding
of
the
state
criminal
trial
court
would
have
been
binding
upon
the
registrar
we
say
and
it
is
the
kind
of
relatively
simple
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that
was
a
finding
the
under
state
statute,
the
trial
judge
dismissed
the
charge
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
not
been
denied
a
chance
for
exculpatory
evidence
through
the
test.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
see.
i
think
the
answer
is,
your
honor,
the
refusal
would
have
been
vitiated
by
the
state
trial
court's
finding.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
that
is
the
law
in
custom
in
massachusetts
if
i
may
represent
it
that
this
is
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
if
there
is
a
finding
by
a
state
trial
judge
that
the
individual
had
been
denied
a
fair
chance
to
take
the
test,
then
his
initial
refusal
washes
out.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
by
--
yes,
yes
your
honor,
by
the
registrar.
so
that
if
he
had
brought
a
copy
of
this
court
disposition
to
the
same
day
or
surrender
hearing,
his
license
would
have
been
reinstated.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
among
several
others.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
sir.
our
view
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
there
was
driving
under
the
influence
--
driving
to
endanger
and
driving
without
a
license.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
the
custom,
--
the
custom,
i
think
your
honor,
is
that
if
a
judge
decides
in
the
circumstances
that
a
driver
has
been
denied
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
we
don't
have
--
we
don't
have
an
absolute
time
spent
incorporated
into
a
statute
so
that
there
is
discretion
deciding
in
the
trial
judge's
judgment.
the
trial
judge
here
was
he
had
evidence
about
this
incident
and
decided
that
the
individual
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
i
hesitate
to
say
as
a
matter
of
massachusetts
law,
as
a
matter
of
the
trial
judge's
application.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
it's
a
very
circumstantial
question,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
initially
to
the
police
and
ultimately
to
a
trial
judge.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
because
instead
of
and
as
an
applied
attack
upon
the
statute
we
have
here
a
facial
attack.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
as
a
practical
matter,
because
he
forwent
the
same
day
hearing,
he
did
not
give
his
license
back
and
continued
to
be
inconvenience
by
28
days.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
no,
your
honor.
it
was
returned
at
the
outset
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
was.
it
was,
your
honor,
the
registrar
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
--
it
was
by
the
registrar?
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
as
a
result
of
this
lawsuit.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
the
federal
district
court
view
the
statute
almost
initially
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
see.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it's
part
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
case.
the
reg
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
think
it,
yes,
that
they
should
shortly
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
the
registrar
at
our
suggest
and
assented
to
the
return
of
the
license.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
the
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
did
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
parties
on
the
district
court
have
analyzed
this
case
under
the
three
prior
hearing
criteria
announced
in
mathews
versus
eldridge
and
applied
in
dixon
versus
love.
the
first
factor
is
the
magnitude
of
the
private
interest.
since
bell
versus
burson,
it
has
been
settled
that
a
person's
interests
and
a
driver's
license
requires
some
kind
of
hearing
for
its
deprivation.
however,
the
timing
and
the
thoroughness
of
the
hearing
can
vary
according
to
the
risk
of
error
and
the
strength
of
the
public
purpose
served
by
a
license
suspension.
in
dixon,
the
court
concluded
that
the
license
interests
was
not
so
great
as
to
require
as
to
depart
from
the
ordinary
principal
established
by
our
decisions
that
something
less
than
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
sufficient
prior
to
an
adverse
administrative
action.
the
court
went
on
to
weigh
the
chance
of
error
and
the
public
safety
interests
served
by
the
illinois
habitual
offender
law
and
decided
that
a
subsequent
hearing
typically
one
more
than
20
days
after
suspension
was
constitutionally
sufficient
for
the
usual
driver
in
illinois.
by
contrast,
the
massachusetts
system
affords
a
hearing
opportunity
often
able
to
begin
on
the
same
day
as
the
license
surrender.
even
if
one
takes
a
pessimistic
view
of
the
driver's
brief
that
a
complete
hearing
opportunity
will
consume
7
to
10
days
of
the
suspension
time,
that
figure
is
drastically
less
than
the
post-suspension
time
spent
permitted
in
dixon.
the
second
factor,
in
the
court's
decisions
has
been
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
license
suspension.
the
massachusetts
statute
builds
in
a
number
of
safeguards
against
this
possibility.
an
officer
must
offer
the
test
and
inform
the
driver
of
the
90-day
suspension
for
its
refusal
in
the
presence
of
a
witness.
upon
refusal,
he
must
immediately
execute
under
penalties
of
perjury
the
report
of
refusal
which
must
in
turn
set
out
probable
cause
for
the
original
arrest,
the
fact
of
the
arrest
and
the
driver's
refusal
of
the
test.
in
addition,
the
witnessing
officer
and
the
superior
officer
to
whom
he
is
accountable
must
endorse
the
report
before
it's
transmission
to
the
registrar.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
there
were
four
symptoms,
your
honor.
there
was
the
odor
of
alcohol,
glassy
eyes,
slurred
speech,
and
one
in
particular,
the
final
one
was
that
his
footing
was
so
shaky
that
he
had
to
hold
on
to
a
street
sign
to
maintain
his
balance.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
does.
the
arrest,
the
underlying
arrest
must
be
a
valid
arrest
before
a
test
is
put
to
the
individual.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
it's
--
the
officer
must
set
out
the
grounds
of
probable
cause
in
his
report
of
refusal
going
to
the
registrar.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
not
properly,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
as
a
predicate
for
offering
the
test
and
this
report
of
refusal,
i
think
is
intended
to
ensure
that
initial
safeguard.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
think
only
to
the
refusal,
your
honor.
i
think
most
typically
if
police
are
patrolling
in
pairs,
usually
the
partner
becomes
the
witness.
however,
the
test
is
not
offered
until
they
are
back
at
the
station
house.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there
was
that
--
the
only
extraneous
offense
was
that
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
you
can
be
sober
and
be
driving
to
endanger
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
driver
has
criticized
the
report
of
refusal
as
a
mechanical
checklist
but
in
particular
this
narrative
description
of
the
grounds
constituting
probable
cause
we
think
are
against
the
kind
of
one-sided
form
of
affidavit.
that
would
be
suspect
and
of
course
it's
again
ties
into
an
effort
to
prevent
an
erroneous
taking.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
circumstantially
yes.
and
the
circumstances,
this
is
an
adequate
hearing.
if
there
is
one
crucial
feature
that
makes
our
statute
constitutional,
i
would
submit
it
is
the
surrender
hearing
and
the
surrender
hearing
in
particular
is
a
fairly
thorough
proceeding.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
on
the
day
of
surrender
typically.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that
he
must
surrender
his
license.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
oh!
forthwith.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
does
not.
he
is
suppose
to
sprint
i
think
to
the
local
registry
office
with
the
license.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
he
gets
the
hearing
at
the
registry
office.
excuse
me.
altogether,
there
are
35
branch
offices.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
but
he
can't
get
witnesses
if
it
is
going
to
take
any
time.
the
surrender
hearing
does
permit
him
to
be
represented
by
counsel
to
introduce
evidence
on
any
of
the
issues
concerning
refusal
and
to
cross-examine
witnesses.
furthermore,
the
surrender
hearing
will
be
continued
if
he
requested
to
be
continued.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
in
the
meantime.
now,
my
brother
criticizes
the
surrender
hearing
because
it
is
by
nature
a
post
suspension
hearing.
but
he
concedes
that
typically,
and
i
believe
he
looks
at
the
statute
most
pessimistically
than
typically,
it
is
a
7
to
10-day
process.
and
we
submit
that
if
you
compare
this
time
spent
with
the
time
spent
in
dixon
versus
love
which
was
at
20
days,
it
compares
very
favorably.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
is
--
that
is
the
main
distinction
of
dixon
versus
love.
we
think
it's
mitigated
by
at
least
three
factors.
first,
the
relative
speed
and
thoroughness
of
the
surrender
hearing
we
think
that
it
comes
usually
more
quickly
than
7
to
10
days.
secondly,
we
have
the
same
kind
of
public
safety
purpose
at
work
in
this
case
as
we
did
in
dixon
versus
love.
and
finally,
the
magnitude
of
the
deprivation
again
is
7
to
10-day
deprivation
as
against
a
20
or
more
deprivation
in
dixon
versus
love.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
it
--
it
does
not,
your
honor.
the
statute
simply
requires
that
there
be
a
hearing.
it's
stipulated
by
the
parties
that
therein
administering
the
statute
the
registrar
has
set
up
this
same
day
process.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
correct.
this
--
the
surrender
hearing
is
particularly
suited
to
correct
obvious
mistakes
and
we
submit
that
this
case
was
a
paradigm
example
of
an
obvious
mistake.
it
is
going
to
take
a
few
extra
days
if
there
are
serious
issues
about
probable
cause
and
police
must
be
cross-examined.
but
the
process,
the
7
to
10-day
process,
is
practically
an
adjudicatory
process
and
evidentiary
process.
it
is
not
simply
an
opportunity
for
the
driver
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story
or
ask
for
a
break.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
we
think
that
very
few
people
would
take
the
test
and
that
everyone
would
seek
the
hearing
when
the
statute
was
enforced
approximately
one
out
of
three
people
arrested
for
drunken
driving
still
resisted
the
test
and
we
think
that
that
presented
to
us
--
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
no,
i
think
there
is
a
reflexive
reaction
to
the
inculpatory
nature
of
the
test.
if
someone
is
marginally
intoxicated
and
confronts
the
breathalyzer,
i
think
there
is
a
reflexive
resistance
to
it
and
hope
that
in
some
way
with
an
intervening
hearing
they
would
be
able
to
worn
off
any
kind
of
suspension.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
i
think
it's
the
immediacy
and
the
certainty
of
the
suspension.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
well,
hopefully
three
days
later.
but
i
think
the
typical
driver
is
going
to
feel
that
if
he
can
avoid
the
test
for
the
time
being
and
it's
incriminating
evidence,
and
come
up
with
some
kind
of
help
before
he
shows
up
for
a
hearing,
he
will
somehow
be
able
to
avoid
the
drunken-driving
charge.
mr.
mitchell
j.
sikora,
jr.
possibly,
but
it's
the
immediacy,
it's
the
fact
that
you
are
suspended
immediately
that
we
think
is
crucial.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
