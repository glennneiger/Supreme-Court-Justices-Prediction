mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
case
who
in
turn
represent
a
class
claiming
to
be
the
true
congregation
of
the
vineville
presbyterian
church
in
macon,
georgia.
since
1904,
that
church
has
been
a
member
of
the
augusta-macon
presbytery
which
in
turn
is
a
part
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states
which
i
will
call
pcus
in
shorthand
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
hull
case
and
as
the
trial
court
held
in
this
case,
pcus
is
a
hierarchal
church.
it
has
an
ascending
order
of
judicatories
beginning
with
the
local
church
session
made
up
of
the
minister
and
its
elders
then
proceeding
up
to
the
presbytery
which
includes
ministers
and
elders
from
a
number
of
churches
and
then
the
synod
which
includes
a
number
of
presbyteries
and
finally,
the
general
assembly,
the
single
group
that
is
the
highest
court
and
represents
all
the
churches
under
pcus.
each
of
these
bodies
is
called
a
church
court
and
each
has
the
power
under
the
pcus
constitution
to
review
and
overrule
the
actions
of
the
court
below
it.
moreover,
each
can
appoint
a
commission
to
act
in
its
place
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
composed
of
the
minister
and
elected
elders
of
the
local
church.
now,
each
of
these
courts
can
appoint
a
commission
to
act
in
its
place
and
to
report
to
it
and
every
member,
this
is
important,
every
member
who
joins
pcus
in
any
of
its
churches
takes
a
vow
or
an
oath
to
be
bound
by
the
pcus
structure
and
constitution
which
is
principally
embodied
in
the
book
of
georgia
--
church
order
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
back
in
may
1973,
certain
members
voted
at
a
meeting,
164
--
oh,
i'm
sorry,
165
to
94
to
adopt
the
resolution
separating
the
vineville
presbyterian
church
from
the
augusta-macon
presbytery
and
from
pcus
and
to
be
an
independent
church.
the
respondents
here
represent
a
class
made
up
of
that
majority
vote
and
my
clients,
the
petitioners
represent
a
class
of
the
minority
in
that
vote.
the
majority
struck
the
minority
members'
names
from
the
roles
and
refused
them
to
use
--
to
let
them
use
the
church
property
as
a
unit
of
pcus.
and
the
majority
subsequently
joined
the
presbyterian
church
in
america
which
is
an
entirely
separate
group
totally
unrelated
to
pcus.
the
majority
also
notified
the
presbytery
of
pcus
of
their
action
and
the
minister
wrote
to
the
presbytery
relinquishing
his
membership
in
the
denomination.
i
might
add
here
that
all
of
these
facts
had
been
stipulated.
the
presbytery
appointed
a
commission
as
it
had
a
right
to
do
under
its
constitution
to
investigate
this
situation
which
it
did.
and
the
commission
made
three
basic
findings.
first,
it
found
and
declared
that
those
members
of
the
vineville
presbyterian
church
who
held
to
their
original
vows
and
did
not
renounce
their
affiliation
with
pcus
were
the
true
congregation
of
the
church.
secondly,
they
withdrew
all
authority
from
the
minister
and
officers
who
agreed
to
the
statement
of
withdrawal.
and
finally,
it
found
that
the
church
session
of
the
vineville
presbyterian
church
was
unable
to
act.
it
did
that
because
that
gave
the
power
to
not
only
make
these
findings
but
made
it
certain
further
suggestions
to
the
presbyterian.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
unanimous
vote
in
my
view
your
honor
would
have
had
no
effect
and
it
has
been
so
held
in
various
state
courts.
there
was
a
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
the
--
under
the
constitution,
it
would
have
reverted
to
the
presbytery
itself.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
--
that's
the
commission
appointed
by
the
presbytery.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
question
of
where
a
--
what
happens
when
a
church
commission
acts
improperly
is
one
that
is
somewhat
up
in
the
air
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision.
you
will
recall
originally
back
in
gonzales,
the
rule
was
that
if
there
was
fraud
collusion
or
arbitrariness,
the
courts
could
look
into
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
somebody
had
a
financial
interest
in
the
outcome.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
if
the
book
of
order
says
that's
no
problem,
i
--
my
own
view
is
that
a
civil
court
cannot
look
into
that
under
the
ruling
under
the
serbian.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct
but
i
must
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly.
that's
what
you
said
in
serbian.
you
in
effect
eliminated
the
arbitrariness
standard
and
said
that
you
could
not
go
behind
the
church
rulings.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
very
strongly
that
that's
not
this
case
because
here,
there
has
at
no
point
than
any
challenge
to
the
commission's
ruling
and
in
fact,
i
think
your
job
is
made
much
easier
by
the
fact
that
the
respondents
have
admitted
that
the
pcus
does
have
authority
to
determine
the
true
denomination
of
the
church.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
will
tell
you
what
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
well,
that's
based
on
the
constitution
of
pcus
and
the
fact
that
it
allows
commissions
to
be
appointed
to
determine
true
denominations.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
everyone
in
this
case
agrees
your
honor
that
the
title
to
this
property
is
in
certain
trustees
who
hold
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
church
which
is
made
up
of
the
congregation
so
that
the
congregation
owns
this
property
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
and
consequently,
the
only
question
is
who
is
the
congregation?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
quite
frankly
misunderstood
the
argument
in
this
case
and
i'll
be
very
candid.
i
think
the
respondents
have
to.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
thought
that
this
was
the
hull
case.
and
in
hull,
it
was
argued
that
there
was
an
implied
trust
in
favor
of
the
mother
church.
the
mother
church
was
a
party
in
that
case.
the
mother
church
is
not
even
a
party
in
this
case
although
it
is
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
result.
and
in
that
case,
it
was
argued
both
in
the
georgia
courts
and
in
this
court
that
there
was
an
implied
trust
in
favor
of
the
mother
church.
this
court
rule
as
you
recall
that
the
problem
with
the
implied
trust
was
that
it
incorporated
the
doctrine
as
you
couldn't
depart
from
church
doctrine
when
you
struck
that
down.
when
it
went
back
to
the
georgia
courts
they
said,
“well,
if
we're
going
to
strike
down
part
of
our
implied
trust,
we'll
strike
it
all
out
and
there
is
no
implied
trust".
but
the
courts
below
treated
this
case
as
if
it
was
an
implied
trust
case.
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
you
will
find
nothing
about
an
implied
trust.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
title
documents
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir?
oh,
excuse
me.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
all
of
the
title
documents
except
one
place
the
property
in
the
names
of
trustees.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
typically
except
one.
there
is
one
that
gave
the
church
property
directly
to
the
church
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course
the
property
directly
to
the
church
but
the
others
all
gave
it
to
trustees
and
virtually
all
that
immunes
the
word
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
the
deed
say
normally
say
for
the
use,
benefit
and
behoove
of
the
congregation,
of
the
church
which
of
course
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
the
church
which
of
course
is
the
congregation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
under
section
2-3
of
the
book
of
church
order,
it
reads
that
visible
church
catholic
includes
the
local
congregations
or
particular
churches.
this
is
in
accord
with
scriptural
teaching.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
part
of
the
religious
belief
of
this
organization
as
set
forth
in
its
constitution
that
the
congregations
and
churches
are
an
integral
part
of
pcus
and
that
is
what
the
members
vow
to,
swear
to
when
they
become
members
of
the
church
so
they
will
follow
that.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
not
necessarily
because
here,
that
would
follow
what
happens
here.
the
trustee
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there
are
all
kinds
of
--
there
are
at
least
six
different
provisions
in
here
that
in
my
judgment
gives
the
presbytery
power
to
say
who
the
congregation
is.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
it
was
a
corporation.
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
organized
in
1950.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
forget
the
date
but
there
a
lapse
of
years
because
the
church
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
i
didn't
realize
it
had
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct
and
that
was
granted.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
on
the
impression
that
the
church
is
presently
incorporated
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
--
i
can't
account
to
that.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
i
understand
that
under
georgia
law,
corporations
are
not
perpetual.
that's
the
reason
that
it
was
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i've
been
advised
by
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
the
georgia
counsel.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
apparently,
you
do
not
need
to
keep
reincorporating
now
and
that's
the
reason
that
the
church
is
presently
considered
incorporated.
and
as
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
trial
court
has
so
referred
to
it
and
the
commission
and
so
forth
treated
the
court
as
an
incorporated
court.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
the
sesion
is
elected
by
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
that
the
session
appoints
the
trustees
from
time
to
time
who
hold
title
for
the
benefit
of
the
congregation,
the
church
which
of
course
is
the
congregation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i'm
suggesting
--
no,
wait,
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
corporation
is
more
of
the
church,
the
legal
--
that
holds
the
legal
title
in
the
church.
the
session
determines
who
the
trustees
are
and
of
course,
the
session
can
be
overruled
anytime
by
the
presbytery
and
on
up
the
judicatory
scale.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
there
are
at
least
11
different
o's
set
forth
in
the
book
of
church
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
i
--
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
--
these
--
the
various
deeds
and
so
forth.
the
only
effect
of
them
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
the
reason
that
i
don't
have
to
make
that
argument
is
that
everyone
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i'll
be
happy
to
make
that
one
then
your
honor
if
you
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
neutral
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
the
point.
and
even
if
we
were
to
use
neutral
principles
which
we
say
you
don't
really
get
to
but
even
if
you
have
to
use
them,
all
it
does
is
get
you
right
back
to
the
beginning
again
that
the
title
is
in
the
local
church
which
is
made
up
of
its
congregation
and
there
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
and
therefore
who
is
the
congregation?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
the
church
has
properly
ruled
on
the
question
of
who
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
don't
use
any
neutral
principles
at
all.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
you
used
neutral
--
so-called
neutral
principles
under
the
state
law,
all
you
would
get
is
a
ruling
that
this
particular
church
properly
try
--
property
belongs
to
the
local
church
or
its
congregation
and
that's
all
it
would
do
for
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
thought
that
this
case
was
a
hull
case
in
which
we
were
trying
to
assert
an
implied
trust
in
favor
of
the
mother
church
and
it
said,
since
hull,
there
is
no
implied
trust
in
georgia.
and
consequently,
the
property
is
in
the
church
but
then
it
went
on
to
say
without
citing
any
reason
for
it
at
all
composed
of
the
majority
and
it
could
--
that
the
majority
could
rule.
it
didn't
give
any
reason
for
that.
it
didn't
look
to
our
book,
the
church
--
book
of
church
order
to
see
if
that
was
proper
and
it
totally
ignored,
refused
to
give
any
credence
to
this
administrative
authority.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
you
ruled
in
kedroff
and
gonzales
and
serbian
and
in
all
of
these
cases
that
of
course
they
have
to
follow
that.
it's
a
proper
church
ruling.
let
me
show
you
where
i
think
they
went
off
right
in
the
beginning
and
the
reason
--
and
if
you
look
at
the
respondent's
brief,
i
think
it's
the
same
thing.
what
the
trial
court
said
was,
“pcus
had
no
authority
by
resolution
to
constitute
plaintiffs
as
trustees
or
as
the
two
congregation
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
trust
relationship
with
respect
to
the
church
property
of
epc
when
none
previously
existed.
they
thought
this
was
an
implied
trust
case.
and
we
have
never
claimed
an
implied
trust
on
behalf
of
the
mother
church
here.
what
we
have
said
is
that
we
decided
one
question
and
one
question
only
that's
pertinent
and
that
is
that
the
true
congregation
of
this
church
is
the
minority.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
--
no.
that's
because
of
a
particular
provision
in
the
--
of
what
happens
in
the
book
of
church
order
your
honor.
in
6-3,
you'll
find
that
there
is
--
if
--
let
me
just
read
it
to
you
here.
if
a
church
is
dissolved
by
the
presbytery
or
otherwise
ceased
to
exist
and
no
disposition
have
been
made
of
its
property,
those
who
hold
the
title
of
the
property
shall
--
this
is
--
i'm
sorry,
joint
appendix
36
--
shall
deliver
and
convey
and
transfer
to
the
presbytery.
so
this
would
be
by
i
think
under
those
circumstances
if
you
had
unanimous
vote
so
that
the
entire
congregation
walked
out
in
effect
the
church
would
be
standing
there
ceasing
to
exist.
it
certainly
is
a
congregation
and
i
think
under
6-3,
you
could
say
that
the
church
property
would
revert
to
the
presbytery.
but
here,
i
don't
think,
you
know,
you
have
no
such
problem
because
you
did
not
have
a
majority
vote
and
what
they
found
was
in
effect
that
the
church
does
still
cease
to
exist.
it
session
cannot
act
but
it
does
have
a
congregation
and
the
congregation
is
the
minority.
now,
i
must
say
in
all
candor
mr.
justice
brennan
that
i
think
some
of
the
confusion
in
this
case
has
arisen
because
of
a
misreading
of
your
concurrence
in
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
chaps
versus
--
and
i'd
like
to
make
three
points
about
that.
the
misreading
of
course
is
that
you
can
pick
neutral
principles
even
in
the
face
of
a
direct
court
ruling
on
a
subject.
you
can
just
ignore
the
court
ruling
and
apply
so-called
neutral
principles.
in
the
first
place,
your
language
carefully
read
simply
doesn't
say
that.
secondly,
such
a
reading
would
be
directly
contrary
to
what
you
wrote
mr.
justice
in
your
concurrence
in
abington
school
district.
and
thirdly,
and
finally,
such
a
reading
simply
is
that
it
would
fly
squarely
in
the
face
of
this
court's
rulings
in
other
cases
both
before
in
sharpsburg.
if
the
mother
court
has
made
a
judgment
and
a
civil
court
can
simply
ignore
it
and
decide
the
case
on
some
general
principles
of
property
law,
that
court
has
effectively
overruled
the
church
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
civil
courts
may
not
do.
we
believe
that
what
you
meant
and
this
is
certainly
the
way
i
read
your
language
is
that
absence
a
court
ruling
on
the
point
in
issue
that
it
--
i
meant
church
ruling
on
the
point
in
issues
that
the
state
court
is
free
to
look
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
assuming
it's
hierarchical
and
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
trial
court
held
were
hierarchical
that
the
state
court
can
then
turn
to
statutes
or
turn
to
neutral
principles
or
whatever.
but
as
i've
said,
neutral
principles
even
if
they
crept
into
the
case
in
some
fashion,
i
don't
think
do
respondents
any
good
because
it
gets
you
back
to
the
basic
question
of
who
is
the
congregation.
and
whether
you
say
that's
a
question
of
polity
or
a
church
administration
or
internal
organization
or
church
government
or
internal
discipline
or
a
faith
or
whatever,
it
comes
within
what
this
court
in
watson,
kedroff
and
serbian
have
said
that
the
mother
church
can
decide
for
itself.
it
goes
to
the
very
root
of
the
presbyterian
structure
and
its
faith
because
of
the
reasons
that
i've
already
indicated.
now,
why
it
--
what
--
why
do
respondents
admit
that
we
can
determine
who
the
true
congregation
is?
they
say
it's
irrelevant
because
watson
--
the
watson
rule
is
not
applicable
in
georgia.
well,
that
can't
be.
the
georgia
--
the
watson
rule,
this
court
has
said
is
of
constitutional
dimensions
even
though
it
was
not
when
it
was
originally
decided.
and
the
watson
rule
is
very
simply
that
when
you
do
have
a
--
in
a
hierarchical
structure
as
you
have
here
and
you
have
a
proper
church
court
decision
on
an
issue
that
the
civil
courts
must
give
due
deference
to
it.
that
is
a
constitutional
rule.
of
course,
it's
the
rule
of
the
majority
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
must
absolutely
abide
by
it
and
i
use
deference
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
and
that
you're
absolutely
right.
i
think
it's
been
referred
to
your
honors
the
deference
rule.
that's
the
reason
i
say
that
but
of
course
it's
more
than
deference.
it's
absolutely
binding.
we
think
this
case
is
like
you
said
in
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
you
said
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
or
after
you
referred
to
neutral
principles,
you
then
said
--
again,
however,
general
principles
of
property
law
may
not
be
relied
upon
if
their
application
requires
civil
courts
to
resolve
doctrinal
issues.
and
that's
what
you
would
do
here.
you
would
have
to
have
a
civil
court
saying,
"oh
no,
we
override
this
resolution
of
this
proper
church
body
and
say
that
that's
not
the
true
congregation".
and
when
you
referred
to
statutes
you
said,
“in
a
manner
that
precludes
state
interference
in
doctrine,
such
statutes
must
be
carefully
drawn
till
they
--
you
control
of
ecclesiastical
polity
as
well
as
doctrine
to
church
governing
bodies”.
so
in
each
instance,
it
seems
to
me
you
said
in
effect,
you
can
use
this
neutral
principles
and
so
forth
only
if
it
does
not
involve
you
in
church
polity
as
you're
immediately
involved
in
here
if
you
tried
to
apply
them.
in
kedroof,
this
court
said
there
is
no
problem
of
title.
it
is
in
the
appellee
corporation.
the
issue
is
the
right
of
use.
that's
what
the
issue
is
here.
the
title
is
in
the
local
church
as
to
the
use
that's
in
the
congregation.
as
to
the
congregation
that
has
been
decided
by
the
mother
church.
it's
the
petitioners
and
that
we
respect
should
end
the
matter.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'd
like
to
save
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
so
long
as
this
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
any
state
law
that
so
long
as
it
does
not
intrude
upon
the
system
setup
within
the
hierarchical
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
it
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
board
of
directors
could
do
nothing
under
the
pcus
constitution
that
is
not
reviewable
under
the
pcus
constitutional
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely,
sure.
i
hope
that's
quite
clear.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
they
would
say
that
it
is
--
if
i
understand
them
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
what
i
say
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
say
the
issue
is
the
church
--
this
hierarchical
church
having
properly
decided
who
the
congregation
is
and
everybody
agreeing
that
the
congregation
owns
the
property,
we,
the
petitioners
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
they
disagree
with
that.
i
don't
think
they
disagree
with
that
as
to
--
as
--
what
they
say
is
that
we
have
no
business
saying
who
the
congregation
is.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
then
they
say
that
at
least
the
georgia
court
is
right.
and
so,
here
the
majority
can
decide
and
i
out
--
i
have
to
be
very
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
have
to
be
very
candid
with
you
mr.
justice.
i'm
not
sure
i
fully
understand
their
argument.
i'm
going
to
be
interested
to
hear
it
because
it
seems
to
me
that
they
really
are
saying
in
effect
when
they
say
we
can
decide
who
the
congregation
is
and
the
title
is
in
the
congregation
but
that
--
we
should
be
agreeing
with
each
other
and
that's
why
i
don't
quite
understand
their
position.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
it
--
i
do
know
they
say
that
the
watson
rule
is
not
the
rule
in
georgia
and
i
do
know
that
that's
wrong
so
maybe
that's
the
issue.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
do
i
have
any
time
to
make
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
first,
my
opponent
has
said
that
there
is
no
question
of
religion
raised
by
the
pleadings.
i
would
simply
call
your
attention
to
the
complaint
which
was
based
squarely,
totally,
completely
on
this
church
ruling
as
to
who
the
congregation
was.
secondly,
i
agree
with
the
thrust
that
some
of
the
questions
that
we
really
probably
shouldn't
be
arguing
about
in
an
interpretation
of
the
book
of
church
order.
it's
not
for
us
to
do.
but
at
least
to
give
you
some
comfort,
i
would
impose
upon
you
to
make
a
note
if
you
would
of
three
sections,
114,
16-7
and
19-3
which
clearly
show
that
even
as
to
property,
the
presbytery
and
each
ascending
judicator
has
not
only
a
right
but
the
duty
every
year
to
review
the
acts
of
the
next
lower
court.
and
to
change
anyone,
anyone
of
any
nature
that
goes
among
other
things
against
the
best
interest
of
the
mother
church.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
finally
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
agree
that
they
could
have
sold
it
but
the
money
would
have
been
held
in
trust
for
the
congregation
of
the
church
as
determined
by
the
mother
church
when
the
mother
church
reviewed
that
action.
i
doubt
if
they
could
have
gotten
title
back
because
you
have
a
third
innocent
party.
but
--
but
there's
no
question
about
that,
the
money
would
have
been
held
subject
to
review.
and
when
the
presbytery
came
around
if
they
said
if
that
property
should
not
have
been
sold,
that
was
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
church,
they
could
have
sought
--
said
where
that
money
should
have
gone.
my
last
point
is
in
regard
to
sharpsburg,
it's
very
interesting
that
maryland
at
that
time
had
a
statute.
remember
that
that
was
a
congregational
case
but
maryland
had
a
statute
which
said
such
presbyterian
churches,
and
we're
now
referring
to
the
presbyterian
church
in
united
states
maybe
incorporated
only
in
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states
of
america.
in
other
words,
maryland
recognize
even
the
sharpsburg
situation
that
you
had
a
different
situation
from
the
church
of
god
than
you
did
in
the
presbyterian
church
which
was
hierarchical
in
nature.
thank
you
very
much.
