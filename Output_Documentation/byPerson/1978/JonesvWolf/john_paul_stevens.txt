justice
john
paul
stevens
and
who
would
have
owned
the
church
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
page
was
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i'd
like
to
make
three
points
about
that
as
to
why
i
think
they
should
be
totally
disregarded.
first
of
all,
the
so-called
ruling
which
begins
to
be
quoted
at
page
6
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
that
is
a
quotation
from
an
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
denomination.
and
the
denomination
itself
quoted
from
things
which
are
not
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
the
second
point
is
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
stipulation
of
the
parties.
there
is
a
stipulation
in
this
case
which
appears
at
page
316
of
the
appendix
which
provides
that
this
case
will
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings,
the
stipulation
of
the
parties
and
the
exhibits
to
the
pleadings
and
to
the
stipulation.
the
book
of
church
order
as
it
existed
in
its
entirety
in
1973
when
this
controversy
arose
is
a
part
of
the
appendix.
the
ruling
which
is
referred
to
beginning
at
page
6
of
the
petitioners'
reply
brief
is
not
in
the
book
of
church
order.
it's
not
in
the
appendix,
it's
not
in
the
record
and
it's
contrary
to
the
stipulation.
and
third
and
finally,
in
any
event
even
if
the
so-called
ruling
had
been
in
the
record,
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
book
of
church
order
which
i
think
is
a
fundamental
importance.
the
book
of
church
order
can
only
be
amended
or
changed
by
a
three-step
process.
first
of
all,
there
must
be
the
adoption
of
a
proposed
amendment
by
the
general
assembly,
the
highest
body
of
the
presbyterian
church.
secondly,
that
must
be
recommended
to
the
presbyteries
of
which
there
are
72
i
believe
and
must
be
consented
to
by
at
least
the
majority
of
them.
and
third
and
finally,
the
general
assembly
following
consent
by
the
presbyteries
must
then
adopt
and
approve
again.
none
of
that
has
been
done
as
to
any
ruling,
rule,
opinion,
anything
of
that
kind
which
is
cited
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
in
the
reply
brief
of
petitioners.
and
we
would
respectfully
ask
that
that
be
disregarded
by
this
court.
it's
not
in
the
record.
it's
contrary
to
the
stipulation.
it's
not
in
the
book
of
church
order.
