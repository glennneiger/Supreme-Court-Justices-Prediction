justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
prettyman.
that
means
that
the
session
is
the
court
of
first
instance,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
session
is
the
court
of
first
instance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
composed
of?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
prettyman,
assume
that
the
resolution
had
been
adopted
unanimously,
the
may
resolution,
what
is
your
view
as
to
what
the
status
of
the
ownership
of
the
church
would
have
been
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
unless
the
situation
falls
within
the
gonzales
fraud
or
collusion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
otherwise
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
find
that
permissible.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
that
state
law
simply
said
that
in
churches
in
taking
property
shall
take
the
property
in
the
name
of
the
religious
corporation
and
that's
the
end
of
it
and
whoever
controls
a
religious
corporation
controls
the
property.
would
you
think
that
would
be
invalid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
have
to
put
in
some
power
in
them
in
the
presbytery
to
overrule
the
majority
--
the
rule
of
majority
rule
inside
of
the
corporation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
get
back
a
moment
bit
mr.
prettyman
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
a
religious
corporation
organized
here,
was
there
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
corporation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
and
it
had
a
35
year
life.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
it
--
that
35
years
expired
in
--
when
was
it,
19
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
and
the
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
a
petition
for
we
incorporate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
granted
and
that
gave
it
another
35
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
expired
in
1970.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
the
entire
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
that's
--
so
i
can't
find
in
the
record.
that's
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i've
been
looking
for.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
my
question
was
who
does
it
on
the
title
now,
is
there
--
if
there's
no
longer
a
corporation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
in
terms
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
well,
i
--
but
--
more
simply
than
that.
if
in
fact,
these
documents
indicate
to
some
coincidence
between
the
legal
corporate
form
and
the
session
then
automatically,
you
bring
in
the
hierarchical
definitions
in
the
book
of
what
do
you
call
it,
kind
of
prayer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
if
you
would
have
make
that
argument
now
then
why
wouldn't
you
be
making
the
argument
that
these
were
simply
neutral
principles
dealing
with
the
title
of
real
estate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
much
simpler
than
the
one
you're
making.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
prettyman,
when
i
asked
you
at
the
beginning
if
there
were
no
--
if
the
vote
had
been
unanimous,
i
asked
you
where
would
the
title
be
and
you
said
it
would
have
been
in
the
mother
church.
isn't
that
an
implied
trust
theory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
chaps
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
assuming
it's
a
hierarchical.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
where
did
you
find
in
sharpsburg
the
suggestion
that
it's
only
where
there
isn't
any
church
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
court
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
prettyman
before
you
sit
down
let
me
ask
you
probably
a
stupid
question
but
you
phrased
the
question
as
whether
or
not
the
decision
that
your
clients
are
the
con
--
or
the
congregation
is
reviewable
and
they
agree
that
who
the
congregation
is.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
is
the
issue
as
you
see
it.
if
they've
answered
the
question
you
put
the
same
way
you
answer
it,
what
is
the
question
that
separates
you?
how
would
you
frame
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
say?
don't
tell
me
what
they
say.
what
do
you
say
the
issue
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
once
they've
conceded
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
if
you
can
pick
the
congregation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
they
don't
agree
to
that.
i
guess
the
issue
then
is
whether
or
not
the
congregation
has
the
property,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
they
start
out
saying
they
agree
you
are
the
congregation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
decide
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
don't
know
what
the
issue
is
either?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
jones,
just
before
the
resolution
was
adopted,
is
it
correct
that
the
property
was
owned
for
the
benefit
of
the
congregation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
in
some
point
in
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
ceased
to
be
owned
for
the
benefit
of
the
congregation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
some
point
in
time
did
the
property
ceased
to
be
owned
for
the
benefit
of
the
congregation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
state
law
did
the
property
owned
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
property
ownership
changed
just
by
adopting
a
resolution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
so
in
footnote
9
of
your
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
purpose
for
which
they
adopted
this
or
made
this
decision
was
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
decide
who
own
the
property.
that's
the
only
reason
they
got
involved
in
this,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you'd
be
--
if
i
read
your
brief
correctly,
you
didn't
challenge
anything
in
the
find
--
in
their
finding
except
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
the
ownership
followed
the
congregation.
