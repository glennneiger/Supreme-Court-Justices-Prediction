mr.
frank
c.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
church
property
dispute
that
involves
rural
property
in
macon,
georgia.
the
courts
of
georgia
simply
applied
neutral
principles
of
law
in
ruling
that
the
respondents
and
not
the
petitioners
hold
title
and
were
entitle
to
prevail.
it
is
not
a
religious
controversy.
no
question
of
religious
doctrine
or
practice
or
polity
was
raised
by
the
pleadings
or
it
was
considered
or
decided
by
the
trial
court
or
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
is
in
full
accordance
with
this
court's
decisions
in
hull,
sharpsburg
and
serbian.
and
with
an
earlier
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
was
not
even
cited
in
the
petitioners'
brief,
carnes
versus
smith
that
i
will
refer
to
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
find
that
somewhat
difficult
to
understand
and
i'd
like
to
answer
it
in
this
way
if
i
may.
carnes
versus
smith
was
decided
in
1976
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
as
you've
observed,
it
involved
the
united
methodist
church.
that
case
ruled
four
of
the
denomination
applying
neutral
principles
of
law.
the
georgia
court
simply
looked
to
the
book
of
discipline
which
is
the
methodist
counterpart
of
the
book
of
church
order
and
found
clear
cut
provisions
saying
that
local
church
property
in
the
united
methodist
church
is
held
in
trust
for
the
use
of
the
ministry
and
members
of
the
church.
and
based
upon
the
application
of
mutual
principles
in
carnes
versus
smith,
just
as
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
had
done
in
sharpsburg,
it
was
held
that
the
denomination
was
entitled
to
prevail.
i
can't
answer
the
question
other
than
to
speculate
that
perhaps
the
position
being
urged
by
petitioners
here
would
go
even
farther
than
that.
and
would
accomplish
what
would
amount
as
i
would
time
it
to
a
100%
deference
rule
and
would
say
that
in
all
events
neutral
principles
cannot
be
applied
if
any
body
of
the
church
regardless
of
what's
in
the
book
of
discipline
or
the
book
of
church
order
has
issued
a
ruling,
a
judgment
or
an
order
as
existed
here.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
this
case
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
immediately
prior
to
the
controversy
arising,
it
might
be
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
the
conclusion
reached
by
mr.
prettyman.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
immediately
prior
to
may
of
1973,
the
property
was
held
in
the
name
of
a
corporation
under
the
book
of
church
order,
trustees
of
that
corporation
or
acted
and
were
appointed.
under
the
book
of
church
order,
the
majority
of
the
congregation
was
entitled
to
control
the
property.
as
i
will
point
out
a
little
more
detail
later,
the
book
of
church
order
is
absolutely
explicit
in
making
it
clear
that
there
is
no
right
whatever
in
the
presbytery,
a
session
in
the
synod
or
in
the
general
assembly
or
in
any
commission
or
committee
of
the
church
to
have
anything
to
do
with
local
church
property.
to
the
contrary,
in
section
6.1
and
6.2
of
the
book
of
church
order
which
deal
with
local
church
property
is
expressly
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
the
title
deeds
are
--
there
are
three
tracks.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
two
of
the
tracks
are
to
trustees
of
the
local
church
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
--
and
their
successor.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
there
are
actually
a
total
of
six
deeds
i
believe
and
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
they
--
all
six
appear
in
the
appendix.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
that's
typical.
there
is
one
deed
that
goes
to
the
corporation
itself,
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
they
relied
on
four
things
your
honor.
they
relied
first
of
all
on
the
deeds
to
the
property.
they
relied
next
on
the
corporate
charter
which
provided
that
only
the
local
church
would
have
the
right
to
control
the
local
church
property.
they
next
looked
at
some
state
statutes
and
concluded
that
those
statutes
did
not
in
and
of
themselves
give
any
rights
to
the
denomination.
and
finally,
they
looked
to
the
book
of
church
order
itself.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
the
--
either
the
trustee
is
of
the
local
church
or
the
corporation
itself
was
the
local
church.
the
point
that
i
would
make
that
radically
differ
us
from
mr.
prettyman.
there
is
no
question
that
the
title
was
in
the
local
congregation
immediately
prior
to
the
date
in
may
of
1973
when
the
controversy
arose.
but
on
that
date
by
a
vote
of
approximately
two
to
one,
the
respondents
in
this
case
voted
to
withdraw
from
the
denomination
and
to
control
their
property
independently
of
the
denomination.
they
did
this
on
the
basis
of
these
provisions
in
the
book
of
church
order.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
solely
the
local
congregation.
your
honor,
this
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
that
is
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
that
is
certainly
true
if
it
involves
an
in
depth
analysis
but
as
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
held
in
sharpsburg
and
this
court
approved,
a
facial
or
superficial
examination
is
permitted
under
the
application
of
mutual
processes
of
law.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i'm
coming
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
we
take
the
position
that
this
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
let
me
reply
to
that
in
some
detail
if
i
may.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
it's
a
terribly
important
question.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
first
of
all,
the
book
of
church
order
itself
in
section
6.1
and
6.2,
one
deals
with
an
unincorporated
church,
the
other
one
is
an
incorporated
church.
in
each
instance,
it
provides
that
the
local
congregation
solely
shall
have
a
right
to
buy,
sell
own,
dispose,
hold
otherwise
deal
with
real
property.
there
is
no
accountability
by
the
local
congregation
to
anyhow
a
body
--
there
is
no
right
of
review
by
anyhow
--
a
body
with
respect
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
well,
your
honor,
this
controversy
when
it
arose
of
course
resulted
in
two
factions.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
and
this
court
from
the
very
outset
has
never
or
this
case
has
never
been
concerned
with
the
identity
of
the
true
congregation.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
well,
your
honor,
there
was
--
this
is
a
typical
local
church
property
dispute
where
there
are
two
factions
and
the
question
is
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
--
does
this
faction
or
that
faction
have
title
to
the
property
under
the
neutral
principles
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
--
or
formal
title
doctrine,
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
--
which
this
court
has
approved
in
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
that
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
court
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
--
or
the
supreme
court
and
it
was
not
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
may
i
answer
it
two
ways.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
would
respectfully
say
that's
not
the
issue
but
i
would
like
to
give
a
full
answer
to
it.
i
think
the
issue
in
this
case
is
which
faction
of
the
church
is
entitled
under
the
formal
title
doctrine,
the
neutral
principles
of
law
approach
to
hold
the
title.
but
secondly,
in
any
event,
if
it
be
viewed
as
it
has
been
stated
in
that
question,
nevertheless
we
look
to
the
book
of
church
order
as
it
existed
in
may
of
1973
to
determine
how
the
local
congregation
acts,
how
it
determines
what
happens
to
property.
and
that's
the
point
i
was
about
to
address
a
moment
ago.
the
book
of
church
order
says
that
the
local
congregation
itself
is
the
sole
and
exclusive
body
or
a
group
that
has
the
right
to
say
what
happens
to
real
property.
and
secondly
says
that
the
local
congregation
acts
by
a
majority
vote
which
has
what
happened
in
this
instance.
now
this
administrative
commission
that
was
appointed
is
not
appointed
to
--
pursuant
any
provision
in
the
book
of
church
order
which
gives
authority
to
a
presbytery,
a
synod,
the
general
assembly,
a
commission
or
a
committee
any
right
to
review
or
to
consider
a
local
church
property
dispute.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
they
are
contending
otherwise
obviously
your
honor.
so
i
just
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
--
no
citation
appears
to
the
book
of
church
order
that
gives
any
such
authority.
obviously,
the
contention
is
being
made.
and
there's
another
point
i
would
make
in
this
connection
that
i
think
is
extremely
important.
the
petitioners'
reply
brief
at
pages
six
to
nine,
it
seems
to
us
recognizing
that
there
is
simply
as
an
absence
of
any
provision
in
the
book
of
church
order
that
authorizes
the
administrative
commission
to
exercise
jurisdiction
or
that
gives
power
to
anyone
other
than
the
local
congregation
as
to
local
church
property.
quotes
from
a
so-called
ruling
of
the
general
assembly
or
the
presbyterian
church
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
at
pages
--
beginning
at
page
6
your
honor
of
the
petitioners'
replied
brief.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
suppose
it
would
simply
be
a
different
amending
process.
now,
the
point
is
that
no
amending
process
was
followed
or
whatever
it
might
be
in
this
case.
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
the
thrust
of
the
question.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
probably
so.
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
of
church
government
or
polity.
in
any
event,
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case
because
it's
not
contended
that
there's
been
any
amendment
to
the
book
of
church
order
that
incorporates
the
ruling
or
any
of
the
other
matters
that
are
referred
to
beginning
at
page
6
of
the
petitioners'
brief.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
we
do
not
question
the
right
of
the
presbytery
to
decide
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
that
maybe
considered
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
the
administrative
commission
ruling
is
in
the
appendix
--
is
in
the
record
of
the
case,
there's
no
question
of
that
and
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
otherwise.
what
i'm
saying
that
the
so-called
ruling
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
it's
a
rule
--
it's
an
interpretation
of
the
book
of
church
order
or
it's
a
proposed
amendment
to
the
book
of
church
order
that
appears
at
page
6
never
materialized
into
the
form
of
an
amendment.
it
never
became
a
part
of
the
book
of
church
order.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
the
commission
did
not
propose
to
act
pursuant
to
what's
quoted
at
page
6.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
we
say
it
had
full
power
to
do
everything
that
it
did
except
for
the
final
act.
the
--
there's
no
question
whether
the
commission
and
the
presbytery
which
appointed
it
has
the
power
to
make
determinations
about
membership
and
about
faith
and
about
doctrine
and
matters
of
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
they
have
the
right
to
decide
for
themselves
who
will
be
recognized
by
the
denomination
as
the
loyal
or
true
members
of
the
denomination.
there's
no
question
as
to
that.
that's
never
than
a
question
in
this
case.
but
when
the
commission
tries
to
go
one
step
farther
and
to
declare
as
they
did
that
property
rights
are
forfeited.
that's
the
last
sentence
that
appears
in
this
commission
finding.
they
cite
no
basis
in
the
book
of
church
order
for
an
attempted
forfeiture
of
property
rights.
it
then
becomes
proper
and
appropriate
under
the
application
of
the
neutral
principles
doctrine
for
a
civil
court
to
look
at
least
superficially
or
in
a
beginning
manner
at
the
book
of
church
order
and
say,
"is
there
anything?"
is
there
anything
in
the
book
of
church
order
that
says
that
anybody
other
than
the
local
congregation
has
the
right
to
do
anything
with
respect
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
--
to
local
church
property?
mr.
frank
c.
jones
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
be
evasive.
i'm
attempting
now
--
we
have
a
fundamental
difference
as
to
the
issue
in
the
case
obviously.
the
determination
by
the
commission
was
four
months
after
the
controversy
had
arose
and
the
vote
had
been
taken.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
certainly
your
honor.
but
the
question
is,
what
were
the
relatively
rights
of
the
denomination
on
the
one
hand
and
the
local
congregation
which
would
authorized
the
act
by
majority
vote
on
the
other
on
the
date
on
which
the
vote
was
taken.
and
according
to
the
book
of
church
order,
the
local
congregation
was
congregational.
it
was
not
hierarchical
with
respect
to
the
use
and
the
disposition
of
local
church
property
on
the
date
that
the
majority
vote
was
taken.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
i
think
the
sole
basis
for
the
claim
is
made
by
the
petitioners
at
least
in
the
trial
court
is
the
ruling
of
the
administrative
commission.
nothing
was
pointed
to
elsewhere
in
the
book
of
church
order
that
will
justify
any
claim
by
the
denomination.
absent
to
action
of
the
administrative
commission,
this
would
be
like
any
other
voluntary
association
which
by
majority
vote
had
voted
two
to
one
that
the
property
should
be
used
in
a
certain
way.
the
sole
basis
for
the
petitioners
claim
is
that
an
administrative
commission
was
appointed
and
the
administrative
commission
recognized
the
minority
as
being
loyal
to
the
denomination.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
whatever.
the
denomination
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
other
than
the
documents
that
are
outside
the
record
to
which
i
alluded
a
moment
ago
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
they
made
no
interpretation
your
honor
as
far
as
the
record
reveals.
there
was
simply
a
blanket
assertion
that
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
they
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
minority
were
true
to
the
denomination.
that's
on
the
question,
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
they
declared
--
no,
sir.
they
were
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
this
was
an
ex
parte
proceeding
incidentally
that
was
not
participated
in
by
the
respondents.
the
commission
simply
issued
an
edict
and
they
said
that
the
property
rights
of
the
majority
of
the
members
of
the
local
congregation
are
hereby
forfeited.
they
cited
no
provision
in
the
book
of
church
order
that
authorized
such
action.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
by
a
trustees
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
--
and
the
corporation.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
the
moment
that
the
vote
was
taken
two
to
one
and
two
factions
were
created
then
by
virtue
of
the
majority
per
vote
provision
in
the
book
of
church
order,
at
that
time
the
title
was
in
the
majority
of
165
who
voted
to
withdraw
from
the
church
and
to
hold
the
property
independently
of
the
denomination.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
well
there
being
nothing
in
the
book
of
church
order
to
the
contrary.
and
since
the
book
of
church
order
expressly
said
that
the
local
congregation
acts
by
majority
vote
and
that
it
has
the
sole
and
exclusive
power
to
buy,
sell,
mortgage,
own
and
dispose
a
property
that
in
the
moment
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
obviously,
i'm
certain.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
if
i
could
answer
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
the
95
at
that
point
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
--
i
don't
think
we
answered
it
--
we
stated
in
that
word,
what
we
--
i
believe
said
and
certainly
intended
to
say
is
that
the
denomination
has
the
unquestioned
right
to
determine
for
itself
who
it
will
recognize
as
being
true
or
loyal
members
in
that
denomination's
eyes.
we
have
never
acknowledged
that
the
denomination
had
any
right
whatever
with
respect
to
local
church
property.
if
i
may
answer
these
several
questions
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
--
a
little
more
fundamentally
to
go
back
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
i
understand
this
to
be
the
issue.
in
a
state
such
as
georgia
that
has
adopted
the
neutral
principles
approach
which
is
one
of
the
three
approaches
that
this
court
has
recognized
as
being
constitutionally
permissible.
where
the
neutral
principles
approach
is
applied
by
looking
simply
at
deeds,
state
statutes,
the
corporate
chart
of
the
local
church
and
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
denomination's
government
and
well,
by
using
neutral
principles,
it
found
the
title
is
in
the
majority
that
voted
to
withdraw
as
a
result
of
the
resolution
of
withdrawal
and
no
religious
question
is
involved.
nevertheless,
is
it
requisite
that
a
civil
court
differ
to
an
ex
parte
administrative
commission
which
is
appointed
by
the
denomination
and
which
issues
an
ex
parte
finding
or
declaration
that
the
property
rights
of
the
majority
are
forfeited
under
those
circumstances?
if
i
may
go
back
more
fundamentally,
this
case
is
absolutely
identical
with
what
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
sharpsburg
situation.
your
honors
will
recall
that
that
case
first
came
up
and
was
then
remanded
in
the
light
of
hull
for
further
consideration
in
the
light
of
what
was
held
in
that
case.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
then
wrote
a
second
opinion
in
which
they
reviewed
in
great
detail
what
have
been
done
earlier.
in
short,
four
things
were
done.
first
of
all,
they
looked
at
the
deeds.
the
deeds
were
identical
and
result
to
the
deeds
to
the
georgia
property
in
this
case.
secondly,
they
looked
at
the
local
corporation
chart
which
as
here
provided
that
title
was
held
by
the
local
congregation
and
it
had
the
right
to
buy
and
sell
and
so
forth
the
property.
third,
they
looked
at
state
statutes
which
just
as
here
did
not
give
any
rights
to
the
denomination.
and
finally,
they
looked
to
the
book
of
church
government
of
the
church
of
god
and
just
as
here,
just
as
the
book
of
church
order,
they
found
nothing
that
gave
any
rights
other
than
to
the
local
congregation.
so
applying
the
neutral
principles
of
law
which
this
court
has
recognized
can
be
applied
if
it
doesn't
involve
going
into
questions
of
doctrine
in
hull
again
using
one
of
the
three
constitutionally
permissible
methods
that
mr.
justice
brennan
singled
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
sharpsburg
in
which
this
court
unanimously
in
sharpsburg
upheld
in
the
case
of
the
maryland
situation.
and
again,
following
the
neutral
principles
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
church
of
god.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
would
respectfully
say,
"no,
your
honor".
there
were
--
there
was
a
statement
that
it
is
not
totally
hierarchical
but
there
is
also
a
statement
that
is
primarily
presbyterial
in
nature
which
is
one
of
the
forms
of
hierarchical
churches.
the
significance
i
would
submit
is
that
it
was
found
in
the
church
of
god
case
that
as
to
local
property
that
it
was
indeed
congregational.
that
is,
that
it
was
not
hierarchical
as
to
that
matter.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
a
very
important
fact.
yes,
sir.
and
i
would
call
the
attention
to
footnote
8
in
the
petitioners'
reply
brief
and
which
is
acknowledged
in
this
case
that
if
even
in
a
hierarchical
church,
the
book
of
church
government
says
that
as
to
certain
matters
that
it
is
not
hierarchical
then
that
result
of
course
obtains.
well,
that's
precisely
what
the
book
of
church
order
does
in
the
present
case
as
to
local
church
property.
it
says
that
local
church
property
shall
be
subject
to
the
sole
and
exclusive
power
of
the
local
congregation
and
that
is
identical
to
the
church
of
god
situation.
it
meant
in
short
that
neither
the
presbytery
or
the
synod
nor
the
general
assembly
nor
any
commission
or
committee
of
any
of
them
had
any
claim
of
any
kind
to
local
church
property.
i
would
say
in
conclusion,
may
it
please
the
court
that
we
feel
that
this
is
simply
a
local
church
property
dispute
in
which
the
neutral
principles
of
law
or
doctrine
has
been
properly
applied
by
this
--
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
whereas
in
carnes
versus
smith
the
denomination
prevailed
because
it
had
in
its
discipline
appropriate
provisions
with
respect
to
local
church
property.
in
this
case,
the
denomination
did
not
prevail
because
of
a
complete
absence
of
any
right
or
power
in
anyone
other
than
the
local
congregation
with
respect
to
local
church
property.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
the
local
con
--
the
minority
of
the
local
congregation
are
the
petitioners
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
if
i
said
so,
i'll
retract
that
statement.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i'm
afraid
my
time
is
running
out.
what
we
have
sought
to
say
and
i
would
clarify
it
if
we
have
created
the
contrary
impression,
is
that
we
recognize
that
on
matters
of
faith
and
membership,
there's
no
question
whether
the
denomination
has
the
right
to
recognize
who
ever
it
sees
fit
for
its
purposes
to
recognize.
but
we
have
never
acknowledged
that
as
far
as
property
rights
are
concerned
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
that
obviously
was
the
ultimate
result
that
was
solved.
there's
no
question
of
that
but
nothing
your
honor
was
cited
as
a
basis
for
such
a
finding
in
the
book
of
church
order
itself.
and
we
have
never
acknowledge
that
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
reply
to
that
in
the
time
that
remains
other
than
to
say
that
our
position
we
believe
has
consistently
been
that
the
petitioners
represent
only
the
minority
of
the
local
congregation.
and
that
the
denomination
has
only
the
right
to
recognize
the
minority
as
being
true
as
far
as
membership
is
concerned
but
not
with
respect
to
property
rights.
property
rights
are
determined
by
what
was
in
the
book
of
church
order
on
the
date
that
the
schism
took
place.
and
on
that
date,
the
book
of
church
order
said
that
by
majority
vote,
the
local
congregation
had
the
right
to
withdraw
from
the
congregation
and
hold
its
property
independently
of
the
denomination.
