stewart
--
documented
record
indicate
it
had
a
35
of
your
life.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
petition
for
reincorporation,
the
1938
one,
wasn't
it?
that
had
a
provision
in
it
and
whether
petitioner
show
further
that
they
are
the
successors
of
the
original
corporation
that
they
have
been
duly
authorized
by
a
resolution
of
the
session
of
said
church.
we
said
that
session
is
the
court
of
first
instance
in
the
hierarchy.
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
has
vested
the
legal
supervision
of
the
affairs
of
said
church
to
make
this
application
for
a
vital
and
renewal
said
charter
as
it
will
appear
from
the
duly
certified
resolution
of
the
session
of
the
church.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
out
is.
that
reference
to
session
deals
with
the
--
who
is
the
corporation,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
session
and
the
corporation
wanted
the
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
jones,
this
is
an
argument
in
disagreement
with
mr.
prettyman's
reading
of
the
book
of
church
orders?
justice
potter
stewart
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
what
are
the
title
deeds
which
led
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
to
reach
the
result
it
did?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
either
i
referred
to
earlier?
exhibit
g
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
well,
i
think
--
i
thought
this
was
just
a
sample.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
one
is
a
conveyance
to
the
present
trustees
for
vineville
presbyterian
church
and
their
successors
enough?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
the
way
the
others
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
relied
on
these
deeds.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
what
next?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
--
was
there
any
definition
of
local
church
in
any
of
these
papers?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
may
i
--
i
thought
one
thing
that
--
if
anything,
hull
and
all
the
other
cases
stood
for
is
that
courts
including
this
one,
whatnot
got
into
resolving
controversies
of
the
kind
apparently
exist
between
you
and
mr.
prettyman
over
the
meaning
of
the
book
of
church
order
that
that's
something
that
the
church
courts
decide
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
just
take
whatever
the
courts
--
church
courts
decide,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
then
becomes
important
to
define
who
or
what
is
the
local
congregation.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
local
--
if
under
the
law,
the
local
congregation
owns
the
property
then
it's
vital
to
determine
and
define
what
or
who
was
the
local
congregation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
that
fact
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
depends
upon
who
was
the
local
or
what
is
the
local
congregation.
isn't
that
--
isn't
it
--
doesn't
that
--
is
this
so
evident?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
local
congregation
owns
that
property
then
in
order
to
determine
who
owns
the
property
it's
essential
to
determine
who
is
the
local
congregation.
doesn't
that
follow
just
as
a
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
i
--
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument
that
--
and
is
it
that
we
cannot
consider
in
this
case
the
fact
that
the
presbytery
made
a
final
decision
that
the
petitioners
were
the
true
congregation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no.
but
no,
no,
no,
no
--
perhaps
i
didn't
state
my
question
very
well.
may
we
consider
in
this
case
the
fact
and
i
gather
is
the
fact
that
the
presbytery
which
is
the
church
court
made
a
final
decision
in
favor
of
the
petitioners?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
certainly
--
since
that's
not
within
the
stipulation,
we
may
not
consider
it
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
jones,
i
gather
that
your
position
relies
upon
the
same
documents
that
the
--
that
mr.
prettyman
relies
on,
does
he?
namely
the
deeds
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
yes,
i
mean
--
but
--
what
i
mean,
the
deeds,
the
book
of
church
order,
correct?
and
--
as
to
which
as
my
brother
white
has
suggested
at
least
the
church
courts
have
made
a
different
interpretation
than
the
one
that
you
suggest.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
in
the
charity
of
the
local
congregation.
first
of
all,
you
have
to
decide
who
--
you
have
to
determine
who
--
what
is
the
local
congregation,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
what
church
was
it
in
sharpsburg?
justice
potter
stewart
and
wasn't
there
a
determination
first
that
that
was
not
a
hierarchical
church
that
it
was
a
congregational
church
and
was
that
an
absolute
key
to
the
decision
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
quite
essential
to
the
decision
of
that
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
prettyman,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
you
not
agree
that
on
the
date
they
adopted
the
resolution
that
the
congregation
--
majority
of
the
congregation
could
have
conveyed
a
good
title
to
this
property
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
without
the
consent
of
their
people
in
the
central
church?
