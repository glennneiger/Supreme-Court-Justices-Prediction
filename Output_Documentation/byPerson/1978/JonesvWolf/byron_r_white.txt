when
you
tell
us
what
basis
you
have
for
saying
it's
the
property
follows
the
denomination.
i'm
sure
of
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
basis
you
have
for
saying
that
the
property
follows
the
true
congregation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
the
true
congregation
but
you
determine
who
the
true
congregation
is
but
why
does
that
determine
the
ownership
of
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
--
why
did
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
disagree
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
the
trustees
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
any
of
the
deed
say
who
the
trustees
hold
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
church?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
i
just
wondered
if
the
church
wouldn't
be
deemed
that
group
of
people
who
within
the
corporation
manage
to
control
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
that
your
submission
would
be
then
that
if
the
church
--
if
the
church
rule
is
that
when
a
local
congregation
affiliates,
it
becomes
bound
by
a
set
of
hierarchical
rules
in
the
sense
that
--
in
the
sense
that
the
presbytery
has
control
of
the
--
has
the
decision
making
power
over
who
the
congregation
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
state
--
your
submission,
i
take
it
is
that
a
state
may
not
disregard
that
once
the
affiliation
has
been
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
georgia
court
had
said
--
they
realized
--
they
had
looked
at
the
book
and
said,
â€œwe
know
the
book
says
the
presbytery
has
this
power
but
we
under
the
supreme
court's
cases
are
privileged
to
disregard
that
and
just
to
apply
neutral
--
so-called
neutral
principles.
you
would
say
they
were
disentitled
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
prettyman
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
church
law
was
that
the
title
to
church
property
shall
be
in
taking
the
name
of
the
congregation
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
congregation
but
the
state
law
says
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
law
says,
title
to
property
shall
be
taken
in
the
name
of
the
board
of
directors
of
a
religious
--
of
the
religious
corporation
or
in
the
name
of
the
corporation
alone
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
that's
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
state
--
under
the
state
law,
the
--
under
the
state
--
but
according
to
the
state
law,
the
property
is
not
held
for
the
benefit
of
the
congregation.
it
just
says
it's
in
the
name
of
the
corporation
or
in
the
name
of
it
or
in
the
name
of
board
of
directors.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
whoever
the
board
of
directors
happens
to
convey
it
off
to,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
then
--
you
would
say
that
the
state
law
may
not
give
that
board
of
directors
that
church
power
to
convey
the
property
contrary
to
church
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
agree
that
the
property
is
held
for
the
benefit
of
the
congregation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
did
--
then
would
mr.
prettyman's
result
follow
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
assume
that
the
property
were
held
for
the
congregation,
would
his
result
follow?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right
but
not
in
the
--
not
in
the
--
not
in
opposition
to
a
contrary
judgment
of
the
--
if
what
everybody
agrees
is
a
higher
authority
in
the
church.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
presbytery
certainly
doesn't
agree
with
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
to
what
that
book
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes,
alright,
its
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
who
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
presbytery
thought
otherwise,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
disagree
with
you
on
the
reading
of
the
book.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
the
kind
of
a
saying
that
the
--
it's
a
--
that
the
commission
was
carrying
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
it
--
do
you
say
that
it
was
powerless
to
do
what
it
purported
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
to
who
the
true
congregation
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
just
skipped
over
the
point
that
--
we've
done
that
several
times
here.
if
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
determine
who
is
the
congregation
and
it
determined
who
is
the
congregation
then
the
only
question
left
is,
well
--
does
--
is
the
--
does
the
property
--
was
the
property
really
being
held
for
the
congregation
or
wasn't
it?
if
it
was
which
i
thought
you
said
it
was,
why
shouldn't
the
congregation
as
determined
by
the
hierarchy
had
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
obviously,
the
presbytery
and
the
commission
read
that
church
book
differently
than
you
do
on
the
--
in
terms
of
that
last
step
you
were
talking
about.
that
took
--
they
think
the
property
follows
the
congregation
under
the
church
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
they
order
somebody
to
turnover
some
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
declare?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
congregation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
when
they
adopted
the
resolution
and
then
immediately
after
they
adopted
the
resolution,
is
it
not
true,
i
think
you've
conceded
this
that
the
95
were
then
the
local
congregation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
that
in
your
brief.
you
say
you
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
the
minority
is
and
always
has
been
the
true
congregation.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
you
didn't
mean
it
but
you
say
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
tell
me
before
you're
through
what
you
understand
the
issue
to
be.
