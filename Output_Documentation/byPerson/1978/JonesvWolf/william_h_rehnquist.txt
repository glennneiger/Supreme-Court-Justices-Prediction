justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
prettyman,
supposing
that
the
commission
appointed
by
the
--
is
it
--
was
the
possession
you're
referring
to
that
made
these
three
findings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
commission
appointed
by
the
presbytery
had
a
member
who
was
financially
interested
in
the
outcome
of
this
particular
dispute.
and
the
book
of
order
nonetheless
provided
that
he
was
not
disqualified
but
the
state
of
georgia
had
a
general
rule
that
in
all
voluntary
associations,
it
would
enforce
their
bylaws
except
requiring
that
any
member
to
have
sit
in
a
private
adjudication
like
this
should
not
have
a
financial
interest
in
the
outcome.
would
you
say
that
the
state
of
georgia
in
a
case
that
was
perhaps
involving
the
ought
lodge
would
be
prevented
from
applying
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
really
my
question.
i'm
assuming
that
the
church
counsel
acted
entirely
properly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm
also
assuming
that
the
book
of
order
says
that's
no
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
with
respect
to
all
other
voluntary
associations
the
state
can
apply
its
rule
that
says
no
voluntary
association
can
afford
that
or
can
apply
that
sort
of
rule.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
used
the
neutral
principles
that
suit
you
and
the
other
ones
that
you
pay
from
the
church
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
rule
in
your
favor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
book
of
order
provided
just
as
it
did
with
respect
to
amendments
to
the
book
of
order
but
had
an
additional
provision
that
only
a
session
of
the
general
assembly
shall
be
entitled
the
question
of
the
validity
of
an
amendment
that's
adopted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
a
denomination
prescribe
a
method
for
amending
its
fundamental
charter
which
in
this
case
i
think
is
the
book
of
order
and
say
that
challenges
to
the
method
by
which
the
amend
--
for
a
particular
amendment
was
adopted
may
only
be
raised
in
the
canonical
church
or
before
the
canonical
session?
