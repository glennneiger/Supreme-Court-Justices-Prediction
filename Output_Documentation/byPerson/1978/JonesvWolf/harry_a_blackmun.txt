harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
get
to
something
perhaps
more
direct.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
what
about
the
title
documents?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
look
it
--
may
i
just
ask.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
exhibit
g,
is
that
a
sample
of
all
the
title
documents
involved
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'm
reading
here.
present
trustees
for
vineville
presbyterian
church
and
their
successors
in
office
as
such
trustees.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
the
way
all
the
members
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
in
other
words
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you're
making
a
half
of
a
neutral
principles
argument
in
the
sense
that
right
on
the
face
of
the
documents
you
say
titles
in
the
congregation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
--
then
you
just
merely
have
to
determine
who
the
congregation
is.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
mean,
(voice
overlap)
the
congregation
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
which
is
the
session,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
jones,
you
referred
to
carnes
that
involved
the
methodist
church.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
do
you
think
there
is
an
amicus
brief
here
by
the
appropriate
body
of
a
methodist
church
opposing
your
position?
