justice
thurgood
marshall
now
there
is
a
difference
between
motormen
driving
the
train
at
80
miles
an
hour
and
a
porter
pushing
the
broom
at
one
mile
a
year,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
after
the
one
year,
he
is
off
of
drug
forever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
long
as
he
takes
methadone?
