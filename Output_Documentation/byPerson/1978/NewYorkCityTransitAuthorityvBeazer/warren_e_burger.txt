mrs.

i

does

would
you
say
that
a
sensitive
position
or
is
it
rational
to
say
that
there
is
a
risk
that
the
methadone

--
chief

if
we
accept
the
idea
who
has
been
rehabilitated,
that's
one
thing,
but
how
do
you
identify
a
rehabilitated
one
and
what
does
the
record
show
about
the
success
of
rehabilitation?
chief

you

chief

what
about

your

us
that
out
of

patients,
only
10
are
found
free
of
the

after

years

[inaudible]
determined

did
anyone
define
or
did
they
agree
on
a
definition
of
employability?
chief

warren
e.

would
it
be
extraordinary
to
at
least
have
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
the
people
then
employed
who
in
some
capacity,
who
went
into
a
methadone
program
had
not
yet
shown
such
objective
symptoms
as
to
alert
their
employers,
in
other
words
that
they
were
performing?
chief

warren
e.

there
are
degrees,
there
are
degrees
of
addiction
and
they
will
certainly
know
that,
don't
they?

you
mean

but
suppose
they
had
a
tragic
accident
and
it
could
be
traced
to
some
aberration
of
this
man,
naturally
exposing,
that
would
expose
some
rather
difficult

questions,
wouldn't
it,
perhaps
they
knowingly
retained
a
person
who
is
an
addict?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
really
suggesting
that
a
person
who
has
been
one
year
--
that
this
generalization
that
doesn't
probe
into
what
the
degree
of
the
habit
was
before
the
methadone
treatment,
how
much
methadone
they
took,
but
then
when
they
are
stabilized
on
whatever
the
dosage
is
which
might
be
very
high,
medium
or
low,
is
that
person
is
employable
as
an
airline
pilot,
for
example?
chief

do
you
really
mean
it
is
irrelevant?
chief

i
still
don't
understand
why
then
you
say
46%
is
irrelevant
to
this
whole
picture
mrs.
greenberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.

what
if
it
was
86%,
will
it
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.

one
of
the
claims
here
is
that
this
â€“
the
impact
is
discriminatory
on
negroes
and
hispanics?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
is
just
about
irrelevancy,
you
cannot
really
say
that
it
is
irrelevant
in
making
these
evaluations?
chief

warren
e.

do
you
have
anything
further
counsel?
