ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
respond
to
a
question
asked
of
counsel
for
petitioners
about
the
proprietary
of
the
lower
court
having
addressed
the
constitutional
issue
before
title
vii
issue.
it
may
be
that
the
title
vii
issue,
that
title
vii
would
not
provide
full
relief
to
all
members
of
the
class,
some
of
whom
are
white.
however
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
transit
authority's
policy
does
violate
title
vii,
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
which
forecloses
its
ordering
equitable
relief,
including
back
pay
and
seniority
credit.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
do
not
know
why
the
district
court
decided
this.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
was
just
trying
to
recall
whether
the
transit
authority
raised
the
constitutional
issue
relating
to
title
vii
at
the
time
that
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes
it
had
at
that
time.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
counsel
for
petitioners
has
overdrawn
the
scope
of
respondent's
argument
and
of
the
decisions
of
the
courts
below.
we
are
not
concerned
with
some
abstract
question
of
whether
there
would
ever
be
a
rational
basis
for
discriminating
against
methadone
patients.
the
narrow
constitutional
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
transit
authority's
unwritten
rule
of
flatly
excluding
successful
methadone
patients,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
whom
are
fully
employable,
from
even
consideration
for
any
of
its
47,000
jobs,
while
giving
individualized
consideration
to
every
other
applicant
whether
this
constitutes
a
denial
of
equal
protection?
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
think
that
it
helps
us
in
the
sense
that
it
goes
to
the
degree
of
deference
which
this
court
should
afford
to
the
transit
authority's
rule.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
that
may
be
so,
but
even
when
this
court
is
evaluating
a
legislative
rule
as
it
did
in
murgia,
it
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
legislative
--
the
basis
for
the
legislature's
action.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
rule
11
(b)
is
directed
only
to
practices
by
incumbents,
that
is
persons
already
employed
by
the
transit
authority.
it
is
not
directed
to
applicants
for
transit
authority
employment.
so
it
is
not
merely
rule
11
(b)
that
we
are
concerned
with.
it
is
that
transit
authority's
overall
rule
of
not
considering
for
employment
anyone
--
and
of
as
well
as
of
terminating
from
employment
anyone
who
it
discovers
to
be
in
methadone
treatment,
to
ever
have
been
in
methadone
treatment
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes,
that
is
certainly
part
of
our
argument
that
is
irrational
to
do
so,
particularly
in
view
of
the
consideration
that
is
given
to
all
other
employees
and
applicants,
some
of
whom
may
violate
rules.
for
example,
the
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
well
we
are
of
course
representing
methadone
users.
if
you
are
asking
whether
it
would
be
--
we
would
consider
it
irrational
for
the
transit
authority
to
have
a
rule
against
the
present
use
of
narcotics
by
its
employees,
our
answer
would
be
that
it
certainly
would
be
irrational
rule
for
the
transit
authority,
but
i
might
point
out
that
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
pardon?
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
if
it
did
not
encompass
present
methadone
users
and
only
encompassed
present
narcotics
users
who
did
not
have
the
permission
of
the
medical
director,
we
would
not
consider
it
irrational.
the
rule
is
not
an
absolute
--
as
written,
it
is
not
an
absolute
rule.
it
is
a
rule
that
no
one
may
use
certain
kinds
of
drugs
without
permission,
written
permission
of
the
medical
director.
the
transit
authority
does
not
exclude
from
employment
or
terminate
from
employment
persons
who
use
other
drugs
that
are
encompassed
within
that
rule,
for
example
amphetamines
or
tranquilizers.
in
that
case,
it
makes
an
investigation
to
see
whether
there
is
some
reason
why
the
person
should
be
using
those
drugs.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes,
it
is
too
broad
a
rule.
we
are
challenging
it
because
the
transit
authority
--
it
is
only
in
the
case
of
person
who
use
narcotics
that
the
transit
authority
does
not
give
individualizes
consideration.
not
at
issue
here
is
the
transit
authority's
right
to
exclude
methadone
patients
from
any
position,
which
impinges
on
the
safe
operation
of
the
transit
authority.
the
district
court
did
not
designate
which
jobs
the
transit
authority
could
consider
safety-sensitive.
it
gave
some
examples
of
jobs
such
as
motormen,
conductor.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
no,
it
does
not
become
the
business
of
the
court.
the
court
left
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
transit
authority
to
determine
which
of
its
jobs
were
safety-sensitive.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
should
think
that
if
the
transit
authority
abused
its
discretion
in
and
designated
a
job
that
was
obviously
not
safety-sensitive
such
as
file
clerk
job
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
the
proposition
that
a
successful
methadone
patient
who
has
been
rehabilitated,
who
has
been
identified
as
employable
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
pardon
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
the
record
shows
that
after
an
initial
period
of
adjustment
which
can
last
from
a
few
weeks
up
to
at
most
a
year,
that
after
that
period
has
passed,
the
vast
majority
of
methadone
patients
are
employable
and
at
that
group,
the
group
that
has
been
in
treatment
for
a
year
or
more,
is
directly
comparable
to
any
group
of
applicants
for
positions
in
the
transit
authority.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
the
district
court
acting
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
wanting
to
adopt
the
least
intrusive
of
rule
that
it
could,
allowed
the
transit
authority
to
set
aside
certain
jobs
to
fit
within
the
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
well,
i
think
again
it
is
difficult
to
know
why
the
district
court
did
what
it
did.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
for
its
distinguishing
between
a
sensitive
statement
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
think
it
is
a
more
difficult
case
because
the
transit
authority
already
has
a
structure
for
--
it
in
fact
already
does
designate
certain
jobs
as
sensitive
or
non-sensitive.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
they
are
just
like
the
general
population,
some
of
whom
may
--
the
transit
authority
will
employ
and
some
of
whom
it
won't.
the
transit
authority
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes
it
did
and
we
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
was
no
basis
in
the
record
for
doing
so.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
we
did
not
challenge
that.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
it
is
only
an
indication
i
think
your
honor
that
the
district
court
was
proceeding
very
cautiously.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
was
the
district
court
proceeding
irrational?
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
perhaps.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes,
there
is.
[attempt
to
laughter]
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
that
figure
is
i
would
say
an
aberration;
the
context
from
which
that
was
drawn
is
the
following.
one
of
the
class
members
was
trying
to
getting
a
job
with
the
transit
authority.
his
treatment
director
wrote
an
affidavit
--
signed
an
affidavit
in
which
trying
to
show
what
an
exceptional
and
eminently
employable
person
this
mr.
wright
was,
said,
he
is
so
good,
he
has
been
allowed
to
take
home
his
dosage,
so
he
only
has
to
come
in
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
i
run
a
very
tight
ship.
most
of
the
patients
in
my
program
have
to
report
every
day.
the
great
weight
of
the
expert
opinion
was
that
after
one
year,
at
least
two-thirds
in
the
testimony
--
it
was
roughly
from
two-thirds
to
80
or
85%
of
patients
in
treatment
are
fully
employable.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
not
really.
there
was
difference
in
the
numbers
that
we
are
talked
about
one
person
said,
two-thirds
are
employable
and
other
person
said,
80%
are
employable.
one
difference
is
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
programs.
for
example,
irving
lukoff
testified
about
employability
at
one
program
called
addiction
research
treatment
corporation
and
which
by
his
testimony,
employees,
pardon
me,
has
its
patients
the
hardest
core
addicts,
people
who
have
been
incarcerated
for
an
average
of
seven
years
with
long
criminal
records,
very
long
addiction
histories.
in
that
program,
after
one
year
two-thirds
are
employable.
in
some
of
the
other
programs
which
have
a
different
population,
80
or
85%
are
employable.
that
is
the
only
difference.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
think
we
could
have
gone
in
on
that
record.
indeed
a
lot
of
this
--
the
few
persons
the
transit
authority
ever
had
contact
with,
who
were
methadone
treatment
experts,
all
told
the
transit
authority
that
methadone
patients
were
employable.
i
think
we
could
have
gone,
that
given
the
fact
that
through
these
normal,
ordinary
personal
screening
procedures
of
the
transit
authority,
it
could
readily
identify
those
methadone
patients
who
were
employable.
and
that
conclusion
is
based
on
solid,
unchallenged,
uncontroverted
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court.
we
could
have
gone
in
and
challenged
the
transit
authority's
policy
as
irrational.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
everyone
was
talking
about
people
who
were
free
of
drug
use,
of
illicit
drug
use,
free
of
alcohol
abuse,
people
who
had
in
fact
employment
records.
one-third
of
the
persons
going
into
methadone
treatment
are
already
employed
at
the
time
they
enter
treatment
and
people
who
are
generally
evaluated
by
the
treatment
personal
as
being
people
who
would
make
reliable
employees.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
exactly.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
two
of
our
named
plaintiffs
were
employed
by
the
transit
authority
were
fired
solely
because
they
were
in
methadone
treatment.
and
as
in
the
case
of
carl
beazer,
who
had
worked
for
the
transit
authority
for
eleven-and-half-years
and
worked
his
way
up
from
a
job
as
a
car
cleaner
to
a
conductor
to
a
towerman,
the
transit
authority's
own
impartial
disciplinary
review
board
found
that
his
performance
was
satisfactory
throughout
the
term
of
his
employment.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
think
it
--
perhaps
it
could
expose
them
to
some.
if
indeed
the
--
i
don't
know
we
are
talking
about
if
he
was
on
methadone;
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
his
performance
would
be
in
anyway
affected.
in
fact,
there
is
much
in
the
record
to
show
that
methadone
does
not
affect
people's
ability
to
perform
any
jobs
involving
quick
reactions,
alertness,
but
the
fact
was
the
transit
authority
fired
this
person
solely
because
he
was
in
a
methadone
program.
one
other
thing
that
is
not
an
issue
here
is
the
transit
authority's
right
--
first
of
all,
its
right
to
refuse
to
hire
any
methadone
patient
who
has
not
completed
a
year
of
successful
treatment.
it
can
also
refuse
to
hire
anyone
who
does
not
meet
its
normal
objective
employment
standards.
if
the
transitive
authority
required
so
many
years
of
relevant
employment
experience,
it
can
require
that
of
the
class.
the
persons
whom
the
transit
authority
refuses
to
consider
for
even
the
most
ordinary
menial
jobs,
are
socially
responsible
citizens
who
have
valiantly
struggled
and
have
succeeded
in
their
efforts
to
overcome
their
drug
habits.
they
are
free
from
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
and
they
are
employable
by
any
relevant
selection
criteria.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes,
we
did
agree
with
the
one
year
test.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
think,
by
the
time
we
put
in
a
proposal,
we
did
agree
that
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
based
on
the
evidence,
which
was
that
it
takes
a
little
time
for
--
first
of
all,
it
takes
a
little
time
for
a
methadone
patient
to
become
stabilized
on
his
dosage,
go
in
there
and
build
up
to
a
certain
dosage.
secondly,
it
is
conceded
that
a
number
of
persons
who
enter
into
methadone
treatment
are
not
appropriate
patients,
those
are
the
people
who
are
going
there
just
to
get
a,
i
guess
it
might
be
called
a
free
fix,
those
are
the
people
who
cause
disruption
outside
of
the
methadone
clinics,
those
are
the
people
who
either
drop
out
of
the
program
or
are
terminated
by
treatment
personal.
the
longest
period
that
was
mentioned
as
in
the
adjustment
period
by
anyone
was
one
year.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
after
one
year
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
in
a
methadone
treatment
program,
the
patient
is
still
taking
methadone
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
--
but
he
is
stabilized
and
he
is
as
employable
as
anyone
else.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
he
is
employable
as
long
as
he
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
we
would
certainly
not
concede
that
exception.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
i
would
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
don't
know
what
the
standards
or
performance
required
of
airline
pilots
are.
all
of
the
tests
that
were
testified
to
in
this
case
about
performance
showed
that
the
reaction
time,
the
alertness
of
methadone
patients
was
well
within
the
normal
range
of
reaction
time,
alertness,
intellectual
functioning.
there
may
be
different
--
it
is
clearly
within
the
range
required
for
people
who
are
going
to
be
porters
or
clerks.
there
may
be
very
different
standards
for
airline
clerks
and
i
just
don't
know
the
--
but
i
mean
pardon
me
for
airline
pilots,
and
i
just
don't
know
the
answer.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
what
the
judge
found
about
the
ability
of
the
employer
of
the
transit
authority
to
screen
out
or
screen
in
employable
methadone
patients.
first
of
all,
it
is
undisputed
that
there
is
no
class
of
persons
other
than
methadone
patients
and
others
with
the
history
of
narcotic
addiction
to
whom
the
transit
authority
denies
individualized
consideration
for
employment.
the
transit
authority
has
no
blanket
prohibition
against
the
hiring
of
persons
with
potentially
disabling
physical
conditions,
such
as
diabetics
or
epilepsy
or
cardiac
disease.
it
has
no
blanket
prohibition
against
the
hiring
of
persons
with
histories
of
alcoholism.
it
has
no
blanket
prohibition
against
the
hiring
of
persons
with
criminal
records,
or
person
taking
tranquilizers
or
amphetamines
or
persons
who
have
been
confined
to
mental
hospitals.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
the
argument
is
that
there
is
no
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
it
is
an
irrational
classification
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
not
necessarily,
because
under
the
transit
authority's
procedures,
screening
procedures,
they
can
tell
who
would
make
a
good
employee,
whether
he
is
a
methadone
patient
or
whether
he
is
a
former
alcoholic,
there
is
no
--
the
classification
here
is
between
persons
whom
the
transit
authority
will
not
even
give
individualized
consideration
to.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
so
the
methadone
patients
and
people
with
histories
of
drug
abuse,
11
(b)
does
not
talk
about
histories
of
drug
abuse
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
transit
authority
does
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes,
the
record
tells
us
that
46%
of
the
employees
of
transit
authority
are
black
or
hispanic.
however
the
record
does
not
tell
us
what
proportion
of
applicants
for
transit
authority
positions
are
black
or
hispanic,
so
that
the
46%
figure
is
irrelevant.
it
may
be
that
60%
or
70%
of
the
applicants
in
the
new
york
city
to
these
jobs
are
black
or
hispanic.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
we
would
not
contend
that
it
has
a
discouraging
effect
on
all
blacks
or
hispanics.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
because
it
--
the
individuals
who
are
affected
by
it,
a
black
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes
your
honor,
because
the
individuals
who
are
rejected
are
entitled
to
be
considered
on
their
merits
and
not
on
the
basis
of
a
criterion
which
has
the
effect
of
excluding
disproportionately
large
numbers
of
blacks
and
hispanics
and
does
not
the
meet
the
business
necessity
test.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
am
not
sure,
i'll
enter
into
that
proposal
definitely.
the
disproportion
is
that,
while
20%
of
the
labor
force
in
which
the
transit
authority
draws
its
employees
is
black
or
hispanic,
60-65%
of
methadone
patients
are
black
or
hispanic,
it
may
be
higher
than
that.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes
and
the
fact
that
the
transit
authority
has
even
arguably
reached
some
kind
of
racial
balance
in
its
workforce
does
not
immunize
otherwise
discriminatory
non-job
related
practices
from
scrutiny
under
title
vii.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
am
saying
it
is
irrelevant
for
two
reasons.
first
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
first
of
all,
we
would
have
to
know
it
would
not
make
a
difference
if
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
transit
authority
has
claimed
that
they
are
immunized,
that
their
methadone
policy
cannot
be
a
violation
of
title
vii,
because
46%
of
their
employees
are
black
or
hispanic.
that
claim
does
not
make
sense
because
first
of
all,
we
do
not
know
what
percentage
of
all
applicants
to
the
transit
authority
are
black
or
hispanic,
it
may
be
there
is
as
many
as
60-70%.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
am
saying
that
is
irrelevant
in
the
absence
of
any
data
about
what
--
even
if
all
of
their
policies
did
not
result
in
a
--
it's
irrelevant
because
we
don't
know
what
the
racial
composition
of
their
applicants
were.
if
80%
of
their
applicants
were
black
or
hispanic,
the
fact
that
46%
of
their
employees
were
black
or
hispanic
would
just
mean
that
their
selection
policy
as
a
whole
was
discriminating
against
blacks
and
hispanics.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
would
say
that
it
would
still
violate
the
title
vii,
yes
your
honor,
because
the
individuals
who
would
be
affected
and
those
individuals
are
--
it
is
to
individuals
that
the
act
is
directed,
would
still
being
unlawfully
discriminated
against.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
have
no
further
comments,
mr.
chief
justice.
