justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
the
circuit
court
say
there
was
a
violation
of
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
did
for
the
purposes
of
attorney's
fees,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
â€“
did
either
court
or
anybody
suggest
why
the
constitutional
issue
was
reached
without
deciding
the
statutory
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
see
anything
odd
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
didn't
find
anything
wrong
with
that
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
it
possible
that
the
district
court
thought
that
it
might
as
well
reach
it,
titles
of
the
equal
protection
issue
first
because
the
title
vii
issue
also
had
a
constitutional
issue
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was,
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
furthermore,
the
constitutional
issue
in
the
title
vii
question
involved
the
constitutionality
as
an
act
of
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
of
that,
that
is
possible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
certainly
had
it
at
the
time
of
the
district
court
ruled?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
is
so,
why
did
the
district
court
put
aside
the
sensitive
positions?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
what
it
did,
but
i
wonder
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
based
on
what
you
just
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
would
think
that,
that
reservation
of
those
positions
would
also
violate
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
whatever
the
job
is,
you
just
said
that
these
people
who
have
been
running
the
program
successfully
for
a
year
are
just
like
the
general
population,
and
yet
the
district
court
did
not
think
so
obviously?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
the
district
court
let
the
transit
authority
as
a
--
just
on
a
per
se
basis
exclude
any
methadone
--
the
district
court
let
the
transit
authority
apply
its
rule
to
any
sensitive
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
individualizing
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
some
indication
that
the
district
court
thought
there
was
a
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
agree
with
the
one
year
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wasn't
your
proposal
or
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
arrive
at
that,
just
based
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
is
on
methadone
drug?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
where
it
might
make
a
difference
in
the
safety
position,
isn't
it?
