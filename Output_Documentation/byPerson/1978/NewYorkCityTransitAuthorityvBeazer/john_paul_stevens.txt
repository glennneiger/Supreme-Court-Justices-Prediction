justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
offner,
before
you
get
too
deep
into
your
argument,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
about
the
precise
class
we
are
talking
about.
as
i
understand
the
transit
authority's
rule,
it's
rule
11
(b)
that
is
challenged
as
being
an
improper
classification
and
that
talks
about
people,
who
are
using
drugs
in
one
form
or
another
and
the
challenge
is
that
your
treat
methadone
as
a
drug?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that's
but
--
now
what
is
the
state
of
the
record
with
respect
to
persons
who
formerly
used
methadone
but
do
not
now
taking
any
drugs
at
all,
say
someone
who
had
gone
on
rehabilitation
program
and
claimed
he
was
cured.
is
the
record
clear
on
what
the
transit
authority's
policy
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
view
would
be
that
the
there
is
no
absolute
exclusion
of
those
persons
who
have
been
free
for
four,
five
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
certainly
the
language
of
11(b)
itself
would
be
consistent
with
your
explanation
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
greenberg,
isn't
it
correct
that
the
issue
isn't
a
classification
of
methadone
users,
but
rather
the
question
is
whether
rule
11
(b)
as
interpreted
to
include
methadone
users
is
too
broad,
that
is
irrational
because
it
is
too
broad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
begins
--
more
precise
to
say
anyone
who
falls
within
the
terms
--
who
would
fall
within
the
terms
of
11
(b)
if
an
employee
and
then
they
construe
11
(b)
to
include
methadone
users?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
not
consider
11
(b)
irrational
if
they
did
not
define
methadone
users
as
persons
who
use
drugs
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule
or
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
do
have
such
a
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
have
such
a
rule,
which
is
quoted
on
page
5
of
petitioners'
brief,
yeah
that's
what
we
are
talking
about
and
you
don't
contend
that,
that
rule
would
be
irrational
if
the
definition
did
not
encompass
methadone
users
as
i
understand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
like
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
the
statute,
cannot
we
look
at
the
rule
as
thought
it
were
somewhat
like
a
statute
and
we
have
to
determine
its
meaning
by
the
way
it
has
been
construed
and
it
has
been
construed
in
some
of
these
fringe
areas
to
require
individualized
treatment,
and
in
other
areas,
it
includes
methadone
users.
it
seems
to
me
the
basic
classification
you
are
challenging,
is
this
classification
made
by
the
rule
as
interpreted
by
the
transit
authority.
you
are
saying
it
is
too
broad
a
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
proceeding
irrational?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
in
drawing
that
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
judge
conceded
that
that
there
is
exception?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
this
advance
your
argument?
i
mean,
the
question
is
whether
the
one
blanket
exclusion
they
have
is
rational
or
not.
maybe
they
could
have
had
a
whole
bunch
of
other
irrational
exclusions,
but
how
does
that
affect
the
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
an
irrational
classification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
equally
irrational
i
suppose
if
they
excluded
alcoholics
on
a
blanket
basis,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
the
people
to
find
in
rule
11
(b)
as
construed
onto
methadone
users,
so
it
is
rational
or
it
is
irrational?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
so
construed
to
cover
them.
can
i
ask
you
because
your
time
is
going
--
is
expiring,
with
your
title
vii
case,
does
the
record
tell
us
the
relative
number
of
black
and
hispanic
employee
persons
actually
employed
by
the
transit
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
do
we
know
that
the
exclusion
of
the
methadone
users
has
a
disparate
impact
on
blacks
and
hispanics?
perhaps
they
are
all
been
replaced
by
the
people
who
are
black
or
hispanic,
non-methadone
users?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
does
it
violate
title
vii?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
it
was
unlawful,
even
if
every
person
rejected
for
this
reason,
was
replaced
by
a
person
of
the
same
race?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
that
i
have
to
announce
also
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
also
originated
in
new
york.
the
new
york
transit
authority
enforces
a
rule
that
prohibits
its
employees
from
using
narcotic
drugs
of
any
kind.
methadone
is
a
narcotic
drug
that
is
used
widely
in
the
treatment
of
heroine
addiction.
the
transit
authority
enforces
its
no
narcotics
rule
against
persons
who
are
receiving
methadone
treatment.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
persons
who
are
either
discharged
or
refused
employment
because
they
were
taking
methadone.
the
district
court
found
that
the
transit
authorityâ€™s
policy
of
refusing
to
employ
persons
who
use
methadone
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
a
subsequent
opinion,
the
court
also
held
that
the
policy
violates
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
reaching
the
statutory
question.
the
departure
by
those
courts
from
the
procedure
normally
followed
in
addressing
statutory
and
constitutional
questions
in
the
same
case
as
well
as
concerned
that
the
merits
of
these
important
questions
have
been
decided
erroneously
led
us
to
grant
certiorari.
we
now
reverse.
without
reaching
the
question
whether
it
would
be
unlawful
for
the
transit
authority
to
refuse
to
employ
persons
who
have
successfully
completed
a
methadone
treatment
program,
the
court
holds
that
the
policy
of
refusing
to
employ
current
users
of
methadone
does
not
violate
either
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
or
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
justice
powell
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
statement
and
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
