ms.
joan
offner
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
an
employment
policy
of
the
new
york
city
transit
authority,
which
excludes
from
employment
heroin
addicts
participating
in
methadone
maintenance
programs.
the
district
court
found
this
policy
to
be
an
unconstitutional
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
methadone
patients
and
found
further
that
the
policy
had
a
disparate
impact
on
blacks
and
hispanics
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
amended
in
1972
to
apply
to
government
agencies.
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
finding
of
unconstitutionality
and
declined
to
rule
on
the
title
vii
question
finding
it
unnecessary
to
do
so.
both
the
constitutional
question
and
the
title
vii
question
are
before
the
court
today.
i
propose
to
address
myself
first
to
the
equal
protection
issue.
ms.
joan
offner
send
the
title
vii
question
back?
ms.
joan
offner
to
the
circuit
court?
ms.
joan
offner
that
could
be
done,
that
could
be
done.
ms.
joan
offner
no,
the
circuit
court
did
not.
what
happened
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
white
is
that
--
ms.
joan
offner
the
district
court
found
that
title
vii
violation
for
the
purpose
of
awarding
attorney's
fees.
at
that
time
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
of
1976
had
not
yet
been
enacted.
during
pendency
of
the
appeal
it
was
enacted
and
therefore
the
circuit
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
consider
the
title
vii
question.
ms.
joan
offner
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
it
went
just
the
other
way
in
the
district.
the
district
court
found
the
equal
protection
violation
and
said
it
was
therefore
unnecessary
to
deal
with
the
title
vii.
ms.
joan
offner
do
i
see
anything
odd
of
it,
i
certainly
do,
but
that
is
the
way
the
original
district
court
decision
went.
ms.
joan
offner
apparently
they
did
not.
that
is
expressly
stated
in
the
district
court
decision.
they
said
toward
the
end
of
their
decision
that
having
found
an
equal
protection
violation,
there
was
no
need
to
deal
with
the
title
vii
question.
the
proof
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
issue,
consists
of
heroin
addicts,
who
are
participating
in
methadone
maintenance
programs.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
respondents
that
this
group
is
entitled
to
equal
consideration
for
jobs
to
the
same
extent
as
the
non-addict
job
applicant.
ms.
joan
offner
for
all
jobs.
well,
let
me
qualify
that.
to
the
extent
that
the
district
court
established
narrower
boundaries
for
consideration
of
these
people
for
jobs,
there
is
not
limitation.
the
district
court
said
that
in
certain,
what
they
regarded
as
safety
sensitive
positions,
it
would
not
be
necessary.
ms.
joan
offner
well,
the
district
court
specified
motorman,
conductor,
bus
operator
and
positions
dealing
with
power
equipment.
i
suggest
however
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
district
court
exceeded
its
boundaries
in
reaching
that
decision.
in
the
first
place
the
district
court
had
to
make
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
in
order
to
reach
the
point
of
addressing
itself
to
what
or
to
be
a
rational
policy
for
the
transit
authority.
the
transit
authority's
contention
is
that
its
policy
has
a
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
need
and
that
the
constitution
does
not
impose
on
employers
an
obligation
to
participate
in
what
amounts
to
a
sociological
experiment.
the
transit
authority's
refusal
to
employ
methadone
patients
is
based
on
a
variety
of
considerations,
all
of
which
are
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place
the
authority
is
involved
in
a
very
difficult
and
demanding
job
of
providing
subway
and
bus
transportation
to
the
people
of
the
city
of
new
york
on
a
vast
scale,
transporting
something
like
two
billion
passengers
over
the
course
of
the
year.
it
is
our
considered
view
that
the
responsibilities
involved
in
that
operation
require
us
to
employ
people
in
all
job
categories,
who
meet
at
least
reasonable
standards
of
reliability
and
stability.
and
those
considerations,
taken
together
with
the
uncertainties
and
the
failures
of
methadone
treatment
and
the
difficulties
of
determining
the
employability
of
methadone
patients
form
the
basis
and
the
underpinning
for
the
authority's
policy
and
i
think
its
appropriate
to
note
in
this
connection
that
this
court
in
marshall
against
the
united
states
expressed
the
very
same
concerns
about
the
state
of
drug
rehabilitation
programs,
the
validity,
the
uncertainty
and
interestingly
enough
marshall
against
the
united
states
was
decided
in
the
very
same
year
as
the
trial
that
was
conducted
in
this
case,
1974.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
the
testimony
of
a
number
of
medical
experts,
most
of
whom
were
proponents
of
methadone
maintenance.
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
extolling
the
virtues
of
methadone
maintenance
as
the
treatment
for
heroin
addiction,
they
nevertheless
were
constrained
to
admit
that
there
was
and
is
substantial
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
among
methadone
patients.
they
testified
to
the
disruptive
behavior
of
many
patients
at
the
clinics
to
the
black
market
that
exists
in
methadone
with
patients
selling
their
take-home
doses
on
the
street,
and
most
importantly
to
the
issue
in
this
case,
they
testified
to
the
fact
that
methadone
as
a
treatment
for
heroin
addiction
works
sometimes.
indeed
one
of
the
respondents
--
ms.
joan
offner
sometimes
for
some,
for
some
heroin
addicts.
it
works
for
some
heroin
addicts.
it
stabilizes
some
of
them.
ms.
joan
offner
correct.
ms.
joan
offner
there
was
very
little
attention
paid
during
the
course
of
the
trail
to
people
who
detoxified
from
methadone,
in
another
words
people
who
were
totally
drug
free.
the
transit
authority's
executive
office
for
labor
relations
testified
that
the
transit
authority
indeed
will
categorically
exclude
from
employment
current
methadone
users
and
people
who
are
relatively
recent
methadone
users,
but
that
the
authority
would
give
individual
consideration
to
people,
who
have
been
totally
drug-free
for
a
period
of
at
least
five
years
and
can
demonstrate
that
they
are
maintaining
a
stable
existence
in
terms
of
jobs,
in
terms
of
family
life,
in
terms
of
their
social
obligations.
the
district
court's
opinion
in
two
places
that
i
can
recall
indicated
that
they
were
sure
that
the
transit
authority's
policy
extends
as
far
back
as
relatively
recent
methadone
users,
but
that
it
was
not
clear
as
to
what
the
policy
was
with
regard
to
people
who
are
totally
drug-free
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
now
it
is
our
contention
that
the
record
is
clear
because
we
have
the
testimony,
un-controverted
testimony
of
our
executive
officer
with
regard
to
that
policy.
ms.
joan
offner
correct.
ms.
joan
offner
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stevens.
ms.
joan
offner
yes,
that
is
right.
in
terms
of
the
usefulness
of
methadone
as
a
treatment
for
heroin
addiction
for
the
class
as
a
whole
i
think
its
very
interesting
to
note
the
testimony
of
one
of
respondent's
own
medical
experts,
who
testified
that
out
of
the
600
patients
in
his
clinic,
only
10
had
achieved
a
sufficient
level
of
stability
at
the
end
of
two
yeas
in
treatment
to
qualify
for
reduction
of
their
mandatory
clinic
visits
down
to
twice
a
week.
ms.
joan
offner
two
years
in
treatment.
there
was
also
conflicting
testimony
from
the
various
experts
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
high
dose
methadone
programs
as
opposed
to
low-dose
methadone
program
and
with
regard
to
methadone
programs
as
such
compared
with
detoxification
programs.
there
has
obviously
not
been
any
unanimity
among
the
medical
experts
as
to
what
constitutes
an
effective
tool
for
dealing
with
heroin
addiction.
ms.
joan
offner
that
is
not
my
contention
--
ms.
joan
offner
--
mr.
rehnquist.
excuse
me?
ms.
joan
offner
no
i
don't
go
that
far.
the
essence
of
my
argument
with
regard
to
what
the
district
court
did
here
is
that
the
district
court
misunderstood
the
rational
basis
test.
for
the
most
part,
i'm
not
challenging
what
the
district
court
found.
they
found
no
more
than
that
called
substantial
numbers
of
heroin
addicts
are
helped
to
a
stable
condition
by
methadone.
the
essence
of
my
argument
is
that
that
is
not
enough
to
establish
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
under
a
proper
application
of
the
rational
basis
test.
the
uncertainties
of
methadone
treatment
are
compounded
by
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining
the
employability
of
individual
methadone
patients.
the
experts
were
generally
in
agreement
that
when
a
methadone
patient
applies
for
job,
he
presents
a
special
problem
to
the
employer
and
that
the
employer
needs
some
assistance
in
evaluating
this
individual.
the
question
is
where
that
assistance
is
to
come
from.
a
number
of
the
experts
were
frankly
skeptical
about
the
validity
and
usefulness
of
information
that
the
employer
might
obtain
from
the
personnel
at
the
methadone
clinic.
on
the
average
there
is
one
doctor
for
every
200
methadone
patients
at
a
public
methadone
clinic,
so
that
by
in
large
evaluations
of
the
patient's
progress
in
treatment
is
coming
from
non-professional
counselor
personnel
of
the
methadone
clinics,
who
as
the
experts
indicated
very
considerably
in
their
competence
and
in
their
reliability.
this
problem
is
further
compounded
by
federal
confidentiality
regulations,
which
provide
that
even
if
there
is
consent
by
the
patient,
the
methadone
clinic
cannot
disclose
information
--
specific
information
about
the
patient's
condition
to
an
employer
unless
the
employer
makes
a
commitment
that
he
will
not
or
that
it
will
not
use
the
information
adversely
to
the
patient's
interest.
it
is
almost
a
catch-22
situation
where
the
employer
will
not
be
given
specific
information
about
the
patient
unless
the
employer
makes
the
commitment
not
to
use
the
information.
the
idea
is
that
the
employer
is
supposed
to
use
the
information
to
make
an
effort
to
rehabilitate
the
patient,
which
is
all
well
and
good
but
the
employer
as
we
see
it
has
other
obligations
and
that
is
to
keep
the
subway
system
running.
the
classification
in
this
case
does
not
involve
any
fundamental
interest
as
that
term
has
been
defined
by
this
court
nor
does
it
involve
any
suspect
category
as
enumerated
by
the
court;
race,
national
origin,
alienage,
in
some
instance
is
wealth,
not
does
it
involve
immutable
characteristics
of
birth
such
as
those
inherent
in
sex
classifications
and
classifications
of
illegitimacy.
the
group
characteristic
in
this
case
consists
of
a
self-inflicted
heroin
addiction
and
methadone
maintenance
and
that
being
so
there
is
no
dispute
among
the
parties
that
the
proper
test
to
be
applied
in
the
equal
protection
analysis
is
the
rational
basis
standard.
that
standard
as
clarified
by
this
court
in
recent
years
gives
to
the
transit
authority
policy
a
presumption
of
validity,
doesn't
require
individualized
consideration,
approves
the
use
of
broad
classifications
as
long
as
those
classifications
are
rationally
related
to
legitimate
objectives.
contrasted
with
that
standard,
of
course
is
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
in
which
there
is
not
a
presumption
of
legitimacy
in
which
broad
classifications
are
not
acceptable
and
in
which
the
government
classification
must
be
shown
to
be
based
on
a
compelling
need.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court,
thought
they
were
replying
or
intended
to
apply
rational
basis
standards,
but
took
their
instruction
from
cases
that
dealt
with
the
strict
scrutiny
standard,
specifically
sugarman
against
dougall
and
lafleur
against
clevenland
school
board.
as
a
result
they
misunderstood
the
rational
basis
standard
and
in
effect
viewed
the
evidence
in
this
case
through
the
wrong
end
of
the
telescope.
they
focused
their
attention
on
the
minority
of
methadone
patients
who
become
stabilized
and
did
not
deal
with
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
methadone
patients
do
not
become
stabilized.
influenced
by
the
strict
scrutiny
standard,
both
of
the
lower
courts
decided
that
the
transit
authority
policy
was
overly
broad
and
that
the
equal
protection
clause
required
a
more
individualized
approach.
we
submit
that
under
a
proper
rational
basis
analysis,
the
operative
fact
in
this
case
is
not
that
some
methadone
patients
may
become
employable,
but
that
most
of
them
do
not;
and
added
to
that
of
course
is
the
difficulty
of
determining
employability
in
individual
situations.
we
submit
therefore
that
there
is
ample
evidence
to
support
the
policy
of
the
transit
authority
and
the
absence
of
the
invidious
discrimination
necessary
for
finding
of
unconstitutionality
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
title
vii
question.
several
months
after
finding
an
equal
protection
violation,
the
district
court
rendered
a
supplemental
decision
in
which
it
found
that
the
policy
of
the
authority
had
a
disparate
impact
on
blacks
and
hispanics,
and
therefore
violated
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
district
court
decision
totally
distorts
the
concept
of
disparate
impact
as
established
in
griggs
against
duke
power
and
as
carried
forward
in
albemarle
against
moody
and
most
recently
i
think
in
dothard
against
rawlinson.
ms.
joan
offner
it
did
not
reach
the
title
vii
issue,
yes.
ms.
joan
offner
it
was
one
of
the
questions
that
are
posed
in
the
petition
for
cert
mr.
justice
stewart
and
cert
was
granted
on
that
issue.
ms.
joan
offner
that
is
quite
true.
nevertheless
as
i
say,
it
was
one
of
the
two
questions
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari.
ms.
joan
offner
i
do
not
disagree
with
the
chief
justice.
ms.
joan
offner
yes,
i
do
intend
to
do
that.
i
would
just
like
to
say
very
briefly
on
the
title
vii
question
that
as
i
understand
the
disparate
impact
cases
which
this
court
has
decided,
each
of
those
cases
involved
an
actual
absence,
significant
absence
of
minorities
from
the
particular
employer's
workforce.
and
that
absence
existing,
the
court
then
looked
to
the
particular
challenged
employment
policy
to
determine
whether
that
policy
was
where
the
fault
lay.
in
our
case,
no
such
absence
exists.
in
fact,
the
transit
authority's
employment
pattern
includes
46%
blacks
and
hispanics
against
a
profile
in
the
relevant
labor
pool
of
20%
blacks
and
hispanics.
so
we
have
more
than
double
the
percentage
of
minorities
in
the
authority's
workforce,
then
are
represented
in
the
metropolitan
area
workforce.
and
the
respondents
have
suggested
that
this
court
should
dismiss
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
newly
enacted
amendment
to
the
rehabilitation
act.
this
new
amendment
provides
in
general
terms
for
inclusion
of
rehabilitated
drug
addicts
and
alcoholics
as
handicap
persons
under
the
rehabilitation
act.
the
amendment
does
not
expressly
apply
to
methadone
patients.
it
is
our
contention
that
any
attempts
to
include
methadone
patients
within
the
category
of
protected
persons
would
be
certain
to
result
in
litigation.
as
a
practical
matter
what
the
respondents
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
interpret
the
scope
of
this
new
statute
which
has
not
yet
began
to
be
implemented
and
applied
retroactively
to
the
transit
authority.
they
are
asking
the
court
to
sanction
the
enormous
equitable
and
monetary
liability
imposed
on
the
transit
authority
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
which
was
not
enacted
until
four
years
after
the
trial
of
this
action
and
as
i
say
which
has
not
yet
even
began
to
the
be
implemented.
finally
and
perhaps
most
important,
they
are
asking
this
court
to
interpret
the
scope
of
this
new
statute
and
to
establish
a
precedent
in
this
case
which
will
undoubtedly
have
a
compelling
influence
on
the
shape
of
any
future
litigation
under
the
rehabilitation
act.
ms.
joan
offner
there
were
judgments
for
back
pay
for
the
members
of
the
class.
there
is
a
very
substantial
attorney's
fee
award
and
there
is
very
extensive
equitable
relief
demanded
in
terms
of
evaluating
and
hiring
anybody
who
was
turned
down
in
the
past
by
reason
of
being
a
methadone
patient.
ms.
joan
offner
that
is
exactly
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that
is
our
position,
yes.
and
we
do
believe
that
this
is
not
a
proper
case
for
interpretation
of
that
provision
and
that
the
court
should
decline
to
interpret
it,
until
a
proper
case
is
presented
on
a
full
record.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
