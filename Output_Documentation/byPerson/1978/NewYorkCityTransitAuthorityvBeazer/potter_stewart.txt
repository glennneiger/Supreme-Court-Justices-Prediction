justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
ms.
offner,
i
am
correct
am
i
not
in
my
understanding
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
the
title
vii
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
and
since
it
didn't
do
so,
how
or
why
is
that
issue
now
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
question
wholly
undecided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
whose
judgment
we
are
now
reviewing,
isn't
that?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
ms.
offner,
i
gather
that
you
do
not
concede
far
from
it
that
the
statute,
even
as
amended
this
past
october,
requires
you
to
hire
these
people?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
is
stabilized
