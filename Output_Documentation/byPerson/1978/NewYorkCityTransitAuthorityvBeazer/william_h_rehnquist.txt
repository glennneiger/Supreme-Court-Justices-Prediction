justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
conceivable
as
it
is
not
that
if
we
were
to
decide
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
been
incorrect
on
the
constitutional
issue,
we
would
not
have
decide
the
title
vii
issue
ourselves,
but
send
that
back?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
under
the
new
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
three
of
the
four
members
of
the
class
were
presently
participating
in
methadone,
were
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
offner,
if
this
were
a
diversity
case
or
the
issue
had
been
whether
or
not
methadone
participants
can
be
satisfactory
employees
and
the
district
court
had
heard
the
evidence
it
did
and
made
the
findings
it
did,
would
you
say
that
successful
argument
because
it
made
to
a
court
of
appeals
that
its
findings
were
clearly
erroneous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
have
to
go
that
far
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
were
judgments
for
back
pay
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
greenberg,
you
lay
some
stress
on
the
fact
that
the
rule
is
unwritten,
do
you
feel
that
helps
you
or
hinders
you
or
is
it
a
neutral
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
haven't
we
said
that
a
municipal
corporation's
rule
is
--
when
it
is
challenged
constitutionally
just
as
if
the
new
york
legislature
enacted
a
statute
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
would
[inaudible]
whether
it
is
written
or
unwritten?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
it
went
on
--
it
is
going
to
review
that
determination,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
great
weight
of
expert
opinion,
you
do
admit,
i
take
it,
that
there
was
conflict
in
the
district
court
that
different
views
were
presented
and
he
chose
to
believe
the
one
that
he
thought
was
more
persuasive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
instead
of
all
this
testimony
being
presented
to
the
district
court
first,
it
had
been
have
presented
to
the
new
york
transit
authority
and
after
giving
exactly
the
same
testimony,
the
transit
authority
had
adopted
the
rule,
it
did.
do
you
think
you
could
then
have
gone
into
the
district
court
on
that
record
and
said,
this
is
an
irrational
conclusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
your
disproportionate?
what
is
your
numerator
and
what
is
your
denominator?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
percent
of
black
or
hispanic
methadone
users
is
higher
than
the
percentage
of
black
or
hispanic
members
of
the
population
as
a
whole?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
not
you
say
that
if
100%
of
the
applicants
were
black
or
hispanic,
and
100%
of
their
employees
were
black
or
hispanic,
it
still
violate
title
vii,
because
the
ratio
of
methadone
users
to
the
population
in
general?
