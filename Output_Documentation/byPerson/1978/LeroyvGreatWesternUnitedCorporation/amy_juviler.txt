ms.
amy
juviler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
unprecedented
decisions
below
with
which
you
have
just
been
grappling
with
mr.
heiser,
changed
the
law
with
regard
to
jurisdiction
and
venue
so
as
to
expose
the
states,
their
officials
and
the
laws
enacted
by
citizens
of
this
country
through
their
state
representatives
to
unfair
trial
as
occurred
in
this
case.
there
was
no
reason
whatever,
none
to
warp
the
established
procedures
to
accommodate
great
western
united,
a
multi-state
corporation
seeking
to
expand
its
idaho
operations.
suit
in
the
district
court
in
idaho
was
possible
and
was
convenient
for
the
defendants
as
we
demonstrated
in
our
brief.
the
only
reason
that
these
problems
are
presented
to
your
honors,
that
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
securities
act,
personal
jurisdiction
under
the
securities
act
and
the
long-arm
statute,
and
the
limits
on
those
statutes
posed
by
due
process.
and
the
questions
of
venue
not
only
under
the
general
venue
statute
of
this
court
in
issues
have
never
been
presented
before.
and
then
you
wonder
the
securities
act,
the
only
reason
was
that
because
the
lower
courts
were
impatient
to
exercise
their
own
jurisdiction,
the
personal
jurisdiction
of
the
northern
district
court
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
order
to
decide
a
superficial
and
intellectual
question
only.
and
that
is
whether
the
law
of
idaho
was
preventing
shareholders
of
sunshine
mining
company,
who
personally
resided
in
other
states,
from
selling
their
shares
to
great
western
united.
those
shares
we
must
remember
throughout
this
case
were
in
a
company
whose
major
asset
is
the
largest
silver
mine
in
the
united
states
and
a
very
important
resource
of
the
state
of
idaho,
and
permanently
located
in
idaho.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
appellant
kidwell
could.
that's
an
interesting
question
to
pose
to
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
who
sat
in
our
office
and
debated
whether
we
could
take
an
appeal,
because
we
have
to
--
had
to
expend
public
moneys,
and
may
i
say
my
own
profit
funds,
because
the
controller
didn't
think
that
i
was
really
on
state
business
in
dallas
and
new
orleans.
he
thought
i
was
on
some
frolic
in
detour
for
my
own
amusement.
also
the
people
who
provided
us
the
transcripts
have
similarly
suffered
the
skepticism
of
the
controller
of
the
state
of
new
york.
but
we
determined
that
we
wouldn't
burden
this
court
with
yet
another
jurisdictional
problem
in
a
case
already
bothered,
and
we
chose
not
to
appeal
but
to
appear
as
amicus
throughout.
although
we
feel
personally
aggrieved,
i
mean
the
attorney
general
feels
personally
aggrieved
for
having
to
defend
his
statute
in
texas
when
there
was
no
reason
whatever
to
do
so
leading
aside
all
of
the
legal
objections
in
the
constitution.
in
along
the
way
in
doing
this,
we're
not
only
dealing
here
with
statutes
that
failed
to
provide
jurisdiction
and
venue
over
the
state
officials.
but
the
policy
that
is
reflected
by
congress'
utter
lack
of
interest
in
securing
this
kind
of
jurisdiction
over
state
officials,
is
part
of
the
way
our
government
is
organized.
i'm
not
going
to
go
so
far
here
because
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
if
congress
wrote
the
kind
of
statute
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
talking
about,
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
it's
the
violation
of
our
federal
rights
we'd
first
have
to
see
it.
or
perhaps
unconstitutional
as
a
violation
of
due
process
of
the
individual
state
officials
sued
under
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young,
as
to
whether
they
were
given
adequate
notice
that
they
would
be
exposed
in
foreign
jurisdictions
for
their
actions
in
good
faith
compliance
with
their
own
laws.
ms.
amy
juviler
no,
of
course
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
deny
that
it
would
be
possible
for
congress
to
establish
nationwide
service
over
state
officials.
if
the
statute
not
only
gave
full
notice
but
was
based
on
some
reasonableness
and
the
action
also
had
some
basis
in
the
jurisdiction
in
which
--
ms.
amy
juviler
if
congress
had
done
that,
and
well
one
of
the
basic
questions,
you
used
the
word
violate
and
it
has
been
used
here
a
great
many
times.
it
is
not
conceded
and
i
think
it
is
--
does
not
do
credit
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
states
are
not
violators,
the
language
for
a
state
statute
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
williams
act
is
--
or
the
many
aspect
of
the
securities
law
is
precisely
that
conflict.
the
word
violation
does
not
fairly
apprise
a
state
official
that
what
he
does
is
in
conflict
or
in
fact
if
someone
sought
to
sue
the
official
of
the
securities
exchange
commission
under
the
same
grounds,
i
don't
think
he
would
be
given
due
process
notice
that
he
would
be
exposed
to
suit
as
a
violator,
unless
congress
also
said
a
violation
means
that
you
act
in
conflict
with
the
statute.
and
then
i
think
if
congress
did
that
securities
administrators
would
know
that
a
new
era
has
come
into
the
united
states
and
state
statutes
governing
securities
instead
of
giving
the
heavy
presumption
in
favor
of
them
that
they
are
presently
given
now
are
to
be
treated
as
substantively
suspect.
and
without
--
and
because
we
have
a
procedural
system
that
reflects
the
substantive
law
of
securities
regulation
in
this
country,
as
well
as
corporate
regulation,
one
can
expect
that
an
ordinary
state
statute
which
governs
the
affairs
of
corporations
within
that
state,
actually
within
that
state,
and
the
affairs
of
securities
trading
regarding
such
a
corporation,
such
a
statute
is
presumed
correct
and
is
not
presumed
to
be
a
violation
unless
congress
held
hearings
and
thought
about
it
a
lot
and
did
it.
but
congress
hasn't
threatened
us
with
that
nor
is
there
any
suggestion
that
congress
went
so
far.
and
all
of
this
--
your
honors
might
want
to
manipulate,
as
the
courts
below
did,
the
law
to
get
at
the
issue
if
there
wasn't
a
court
sitting
that
could
get
at
the
issue.
but
we've
conceded
from
the
beginning
that
there
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
supremacy
clause
under
1331,
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction
was
available
in
idaho.
furthermore
--
ms.
amy
juviler
i
used
the
wrong
--
well
we
feel
that
it's
very
difficult
to
look
at
the
decisions
below
and
not
think
that
the
laws
of
jurisdiction
and
venue
have
been
manipulated.
now,
one
single
decision
has
a
direct
precedent.
nothing
in
the
finding
jurisdiction
and
venue
over
the
defendant
here
has
a
precedent
in
any
previous
decision.
none
of
it
is
required
by
the
language
of
any
statute
except
by
interpretation
that
is
overlaid
and
is
not
supported
by
precedent.
just
as
an
example
of
the
most
minor
aspect
of
the
venue
decision
of
the
court
below,
look
what
it
did
to
a
multi-state
corporation
doing
business
all
over
the
country.
suddenly
it
can
now
sue
where
its
board
of
directors
reside.
even
though
it's
conceded,
it
was
doing
business
in
idaho
and
it
was
its
idaho
business
that
was
at
issue.
suddenly
in
a
federal
court,
venue
now
lies
for
this
kind
of
action
in
texas
and
the
court
below
implies
that
that's
the
only
place
it
can
lie.
that
applies
not
only
to
actions
against
state
officials
but
to
actions
against
federal
officials
and
to
actions
against
people
who
have
commercial
dealings
with
great
western
united.
indeed
when
sunshine
mining
sued
great
western
under
the
williams
act
in
the
district
of
idaho
following
--
or
sued
herco,
the
successor
company,
after
the
completion
of
this
tender
offer,
great
western
united
said
“oh
no!
you
got
to
sue
us
in
the
northern
district
of
texas.
we
have
special
rights.
we
can
only
be
sued
in
the
northern
district
of
texas.
we
now
own
controlling
interest
in
sunshine
mine.
and
your
cause
of
action
is
about
sunshine
mining
company,
but
we
get
sued
where
we
live
in
texas.”
this
does
terrible
violence
to
the
system
that
has
been
established
by
for
instance,
the
texas
long-arm
statute,
and
also
for
instance
by
section
27.
nationwide
service
of
process
under
section
27
has
a
purpose
and
its
purpose
is
to
make
great
western
united
be
serviceable
where
its
securities
are
issued
and
sunshine
mining
be
served
where
its
service
is
issued.
it
does
not
have
the
purpose
of
making
the
officials
of
idaho
enforcing
their
own
state
statute
serviceable
where
their
decisions
may
have
an
effect.
the
precedential
effect
of
that
kind
of
decision
below
is
overwhelming.
and
for
those
of
us
who
represent
state
officials
with
regularity,
we
know
that
this
will
change
radically
the
way
that
states
are
able
to
defend
themselves.
ms.
amy
juviler
thank
you
very
much.
