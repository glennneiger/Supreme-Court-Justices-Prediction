justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
won't
remind
you
to
do
this
but
you're
going
to
tell
us
what
the
violation
was,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
you
are
going
to
tell
us
just
by
the
way
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it's
kind
of
the
heart
of
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
irwin,
of
course
you
don't
have
to
have
them
all
held
unconstitutional
in
this
transaction,
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
three
of
them
affected
you.
but
the
violation,
to
getting
back
to
the
question
i
asked
before.
the
violation
i
think
it
was
committed
when
mr.
baptie
mailed
the
letter
into
texas,
was
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
did
mr.
mceldowney
when
he
signed
that
order
violate
the
federal
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
commit
a
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they're
also
claiming
the
violation
of
federal
laws,
and
1983
speaks
of
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
sure
you're
abandoning
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
