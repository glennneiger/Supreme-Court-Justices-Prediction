justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
go
ahead?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
idaho
statute
was
typical
of
these
state
statutes.
in
your
brief
on
page
20,
the
first
sentence
under
summary
of
argument
is
“unlike
any
other
state
statutes”
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
i
see.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
say
this
is
typical
of
the
22
or
25
other
state
statutes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
that
too.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
idaho
statue
had
been
limited
to
intrastate
activities,
would
it
be
preempted
in
your
view?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
exactly.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
complaint
also
alleged
the
cause
of
action
under
1983,
what's
the
basis
of
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
civil
rights?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
still
rely
on
1983?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
that
mean
you've
abandoned
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
easterbrook,
if
tender
offers
are
always
so
beneficial
to
stockholders
as
you
suggest,
well
why
did
congress
enact
the
williams
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they've
often
been
beneficial,
but
they've
often
been
quite
adverse.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
easterbrook,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
irwin
that
if
the
idaho
statute
had
been
limited
to
intrastate
activities
that
it
would
have
been
valid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
has
the
commission
taken
that
position
previously
to
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
the
commission's
position
is
that
all
36
state
laws
are
invalid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
any
state
law
that
makes
addition
as
to
the
requirements,
the
williams
act
could
be
invalid
under
that
analysis?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
if
limited
only
to
stockholders
within
the
state?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
it
make
a
difference
if
the
state
statute
is
limited
to
corporations
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
that
state?
