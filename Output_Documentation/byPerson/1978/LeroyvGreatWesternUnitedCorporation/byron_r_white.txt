justice
byron
r.
white
that's
one
--
on
what
basis
for
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
new
york
and
maryland
would,
on
your
basis,
would
have
the
same
objection
to
jurisdiction
in
idaho
as
you
are
placing
--
objecting
to
in
texas?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
was
a
violation
then
there's
nationwide
service,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
assume
there
was
a
violation
by
the
idaho
officers,
and
i
don't
suggest
that
they're
--
that
i
think
there
was.
doesn't
the
securities
law
provide
for
nationwide
jurisdiction
--
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
--
wouldn't
that
give
personal
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
would
you
say
that
even
in
a
case
where
the
prosecution
or
the
action
arose
in
a
case
where
the
alleged
violation
occurred?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
you
wouldn't,
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
the
violation
occurs
in
state
a,
and
the
federal
law
says
that
you
can
serve
anybody
connected
with
this
case
anywhere
in
the
country,
you
wouldn't
object
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
texas.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
heiser,
in
so
far
as
you
are
having
violated
the
statute
or
not,
and
i
don't
suggest
one
way
or
another.
your
position
or
your
status
is
the
same
in
idaho
as
it
is
in
texas.
you
have
violated
it
in
texas
just
as
much
as
you
have
in
idaho
but
no
more
and
no
less.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
violated
it
at
all,
but
you
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
a
--
an
officer
who
tries
to
enforce
a
state
statute
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
in
--
the
terms
you
had
right
to
be
free
from
state
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
so
did
you
client,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
if
each
of
the
other
50
states
had
exactly
the
same
law
and
issued
the
same
order,
you
think
every
state
should
be
subject
to
suit
in
at
least
one
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
many
states
have
takeover
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
four
more
suits
for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
such
--
do
you
think
it
refers
back
to
any
district
in
which
a
criminal
violation
could
be
prosecuted?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
do
you
think
section
27
gives
you
right
to
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
so-called
private
cause
of
action
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
find
some
section
that's
--
to
do
that
right
in
those
securities
law
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
suing
a
state
official,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
interference
with
what
you
claim
as
a
federal
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
all
this
section
says
is
that
actions
may
be
brought
--
any
suit
or
actions
to
enforce
any
a
viability
or
duty
maybe
brought
in
some
--
does
that
automatically
say
any
--
does
that
automatically
provide
for
a
private
causes
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
this
entire
chapter?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
brought
that
forward
in
the
brief
but
it's
in
your
complaint,
it's
a
jurisdictional
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
aren't
you
claiming
that
you
have
a
right
under
the
federal
securities
law
that's
being
violated?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
understand,
but
that
refers
to
the
federal
constitution
whether
you
certainly
are
claiming
that
one
of
your
constitutional
rights
are
being
violated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
the
commerce
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
and
you're
suing
a
state
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
go
on
then.
