and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
idaho
official
appellants
in
this
case
believe
that
the
jurisdiction
and
venue
issues
that
are
brought
here
before
the
court
are
the
most
important
jurisdiction
and
venue
issues
relating
to
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
state
officials
since
the
decision
in
1908
in
ex
parte
young.
and
that
the
issues
on
the
merits
of
this
case
are
very
demanding,
very
interesting
in
the
interrelationship
of
federal
securities
laws
and
state
securities
laws
in
a
system
of
cooperative
federalism.
this
case
involves
in
attempt
by
the
appellee,
great
western
united
corporation,
a
new
york
stock
exchange
traded,
delaware
corporation
with
corporate
offices
in
colorado,
executive
offices
in
texas
and
which
does
business
throughout
the
united
states
to
effect
a
cash
partial
tender
offer
for
up
to
two
million
shares
of
the
outstanding
common
stock
of
the
sunshine
mining
company.
a
new
york
stock
exchange
traded,
washington
state
corporation
with
its
principle
asset,
a
silver
mine
located
in
the
state
of
idaho,
its
corporate
offices
in
the
state
of
idaho,
its
executive
offices
in
new
york
and
other
substantial
assets
in
the
states
of
maryland
and
new
york.
though
in
this
case,
the
proposed
tender
offer
was
initiated
by
great
western
united
corporation
in
dallas,
texas.
the
tender
offer
was
announced
and
disseminated
through
a
new
york
investment
banking
firm
and
the
shares
were
to
be
tendered
to
a
chicago,
illinois
bank.
as
far
as
timing
is
concerned,
on
monday,
march
21,
1977,
great
western
united
corporation
simultaneously
filed
a
scheduled
14d
statement
with
the
securities
exchange
commission
as
required
by
the
william
act
amendment
to
the
1934
securities
exchange
act,
which
relates
to
cash
tender
offers
for
corporate
control.
it
voluntarily
appeared
in
the
state
of
idaho
to
file
a
registration
statement
under
the
idaho
corporate
takeover
law
which
is
the
subject
of
the
constitutional
challenge
herein.
and
it
inquired
of
the
states
of
maryland
and
new
york
as
to
whether
those
states
would
exercise
jurisdiction
under
their
respective
state
takeover
laws.
four
days
later,
that
friday,
the
deputy
administrator
of
securities
of
the
state
of
idaho
responded
to
great
western
united
requesting
additional
information
under
the
idaho
filing
and
contemporaneously,
appellant
mceldowney,
the
director
of
the
idaho
department
of
finance,
submitted
an
executive
order
--
administrative
order
delaying
the
effective
date
of
the
tender
offer.
no
other
official
from
any
state,
including
the
appellant
kidwell
who
has
been
replaced
in
office
by
appellant
leroy,
took
any
action
or
threatened
any
action.
they
were
merely
officials
who
were
charged
under
their
respective
state
laws
with
administering
those
respective
state
securities
laws.
nor
did
great
western
united
ever
attempt
to
negotiate
or
respond
in
part
to
the
request
of
idaho
for
additional
information,
despite
the
fact
that
one
of
those
requests
was
merely
that
the
eight
missing
pages
from
the
xerox
copy
of
the
14d
statement
which
had
been
filed
with
the
scc,
be
submitted.
instead,
great
western
united
sole
response
to
the
request
for
additional
information
that
was
received
by
them
on
a
friday
was
that
next
monday
morning
at
9
o'clock
in
the
morning,
to
appear
in
federal
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
texas,
dallas
division,
seeking
an
ex
parte
temporary
restraining
order
in
a
lawsuit
which
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
takeover
laws
of
idaho,
maryland
and
new
york
and
asserted
that
personal
jurisdiction
and
venue
were
proper
over
the
state
officials
challenged
under
the
ex
parte
young
stripping
doctrine
in
the
northern
district
of
texas,
rather
than
in
their
home
states.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
basis
for
the
constitutional
challenge
was
preemption
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand
that
the
idaho
law
and
the
maryland
and
new
york
law
is
unduly
burdened
interstate
commerce,
and
were
therefore
forbidden
on
that
ground
as
well.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
is
exactly
our
contention.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
officials
involved
were
themselves
regulators
of
securities
transactions
and
are
being
sought
to
be
held
under
the
jurisdiction
and
venue
portion
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
to
be
subject
to
suit
under
that
as
though
they
had
participated
in
fraudulent
activities,
or
had
in
fact
violated
some
direct
command
of
that
securities
exchange
act.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
that
is
the
federal
securities
law
basis
for
jurisdiction.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
the
other
basis
for
jurisdiction
was
the
texas
long-arm
statute
and
under
the
texas
long-arm
statute,
it
was
alleged
that
the
idaho
and
other
officials
were
actually
doing
business
in
texas,
and
doing
business
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
in
that
statute.
it
has
a
two-step
analysis
that
must
be
reached.
the
statute
defines
two
categories
of
doing
business.
one
of
those
categories,
strange
as
it
may
seem,
is
a
tort
that
occurs
in
whole
or
in
part
in
texas,
but
that
is
defined
in
there
as
doing
business.
the
other
aspect
of
doing
business
in
texas
under
the
texas
long-arm
statute
that
is
defined,
is
a
contract,
the
performance
of
which
occurs
all
or
in
part
in
texas
then
the
statute
opens
up
the
scope
and
it
says
that
it
encompasses
other
activities
that
may
constitute
doing
business
in
texas.
and
it
is
very
much
the
appellant's
contention
that
their
activity
in
a
governmental
capacity
in
being
in
idaho,
as
idaho
officials,
charged
with
an
administering
idaho
law
is
certainly
not
an
activity
of
doing
business
in
texas
with
the
commercial
overtone
that
that
doing
business
concept
necessarily
implies.
that
is
the
threshold
consideration
that
must
be
reached
in
the
texas
long-arm
statute
for
assertion
of
personal
jurisdiction.
the
next
requirement
for
inquiry
is
of
course
the
constitutional
due
process
question.
international
shoe,
hanson
versus
denckla,
again
phrased
in
terms
of
minimum
contacts,
activities
that
are
commercial
profit-oriented
activities
that
would
subject
a
company
or
organization
or
person
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
in
a
profit-oriented
mode
to
be
rightfully
subjected
to
jurisdiction
in
a
place
where
the
consequences
of
that
commercial
activity
were
felt.
and
we
submit
that
the
basis
of
this
court's
determinations
in
due
process
really
relate
to
the
fact
that
the
entity
or
person
subjected
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
out
of
state
forum
has
been
one
who
has
sought
the
profit
orientation
of
commercial
activity.
never
before
has
it
been
applied
to
a
state
official
who
is
merely
a
regulator.
and
in
fact
the
mischief
of
it
being
applied
really
relates
to
a
question
that
was
earlier
posed
this
morning
by
justice
marshall
about
being
sued
in
maui.
and
while
it
may
be
nice
for
a
state
official
to
able
to
vacation
in
maui,
it
certainly
is
difficult
when
a
state
official
would
be
called
to
defend
his
action
in
idaho
in
enforcing
an
idaho
law
in
idaho,
in
maui
or
in
any
other
place.
the
chilling
effect
that
that
would
have
on
the
enforcement
of
state
laws,
the
chilling
effect
that
that
would
have
on
legislatures
in
determining
what
law
that
they
passed
might
be
deemed
to
have
somewhere
in
some
other
jurisdiction
of
this
united
states.
an
extra
territorial
effect
or
consequence
would
be
incredible
and
the
budgetary
problems
that
defending
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
present,
are
also
potentially
overwhelming.
the
cost
of
sending
attorneys
and
officials
who
were
hired
by
their
state
to
represent
activities
within
the
state,
sending
them
to
foreign
jurisdictions
to
defend
actions,
the
expense
of
the
legislature
in
a
small
state,
such
as
idaho
trying
to
figure
appropriations
that
would
cover
defenses
and
jurisdictions
throughout
the
united
states
of
allegations
that
are
brought
merely
because
someone
feels
they've
been
affected
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction.
and
the
expense
in
many
of
the
federal
districts
of
the
united
states
where
a
person
cannot
be
admitted
directly
to
practice
before
that
federal
district,
but
must
have
--
you
sometimes
can
appear
pro
hac
vise
with
associate
counsel,
local
counsel.
in
other
instances,
you
can
not
be
admitted
to
practice
before
the
district
at
all
and
you
must
hire
a
local
counsel.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
if
it
were
procedurally
proper
to
entertain
the
lawsuit
in
the
northern
district
of
texas,
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
why
the
idaho
law
could
not
be
assessed
as
it
affected
someone
in
the
northern
district
of
texas.
that
is
correct.
but
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
unfortunately,
and
of
course
we
contend
that
had
this
lawsuit
been
brought
in
the
district
of
idaho
as
it
should've
been,
there
would
be
no
question
that
it
is
a
lawsuit
that
is
properly
entertainable
in
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
idaho.
but
unfortunately,
it
was
not
brought
there
and
that
is
what
poses
the
very
difficult
jurisdiction
and
venue
overlaid
this
case.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
white
that
is
absolutely
correct
and
in
fact,
new
york
and
maryland
very
strenuously
did
object
to
the
jurisdiction
and
venue
being
based
in
texas,
as
i'm
sure
they
would
have,
had
it
been
based
in
idaho.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
is
not
what
i'm
--
would
not
be
my
contention.
under
proper
jurisdiction
and
venue
in
raising
the
federal
question
that
would
be
proper
for
a
federal
court
to
consider
the
idaho
law
or
someone
else's
law.
and
it
might
--
there
might
be
a
situation
like
that
where
idaho
would
participate
as
amicus
curiae
and
volunteer
to
come
down.
i'm
not
saying
that
there
is
a
restraint
on
the
court
in
entertaining
the
idaho
law.
in
fact
i
think
there's
ample
supreme
court
precedent
for
that
occurring.
there
has
been
an
allegation
made
that
the
state
of
idaho
delayed
the
effective
date
of
great
western's
tender
offer
for
the
shares
of
sunshine
mining
company
stock
and
that
it
therefore
interfered
with
the
transaction
of
$31
million
of
interstate
commerce.
in
fact,
the
delay
attributable
to
action
by
idaho
was
for
a
period
of
two
days.
from
march
28
to
march
30,
1977
when
after
hearing
that
there
was
an
ex
parte
temporary
restraining
order
sought,
we
asked
the
federal
district
judge
in
dallas
to
allow
us
to
go
on
the
record,
and
he
postponed
the
hearing
for
two
days.
all
the
other
delay
in
this
case
either
resulted
as
from
a
lawsuit
that
was
brought
by
sunshine
mining
company
in
the
district
of
idaho
against
great
western
united
under
the
williams
act,
charging
that
great
western
united
had
not
complied
with
the
williams
act.
and
the
other
delay
was
occasioned
by
great
western's
desire
to
pursue
in
the
northern
district
of
texas,
this
constitutional
challenge
to
the
idaho,
new
york
and
maryland
takeover
statutes.
we
have
additionally
the
venue
problems.
venue
was
alleged
under
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
section
27
and
venue
there
was
sought
on
the
basis
that
the
violations
that
were
alleged
to
have
been
committed
by
the
state
officials
actually
occurred
in
the
state
of
texas
rather
than
in
the
state
of
idaho.
when
in
fact
the
action
that
did
take
place
was
action
that
was
taken
in
idaho
pursuant
to
the
idaho
law,
was
transmitted
to
texas
at
the
request
of
great
western
united
which
had
sought
the
response
to
be
sent
to
them
in
texas.
so
it
may
have
come
to
rest
in
texas,
but
it
took
place
in
idaho
and
of
course
creates
the
awkward
situation
that
if
you
say
that
for
venue
purposes,
you
have
properly
a
single
federal
district
for
venue
purposes
as
the
place
where
the
violation
occurred,
rather
than
a
place
were
acts
in
furtherance
of
a
violation
occurred,
which
is
not
what
the
venue
statute
says.
then
you
create
this
strange
situation
where
if
venue
is
proper
in
the
northern
district
of
texas,
then
it
can
not
be
proper
in
the
district
of
idaho
and
what
you're
really
challenging
is
the
action
of
the
idaho
officials,
the
idaho
law
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
idaho
law.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
under
the
terms
of
the
texas
long-arm
statute
where
you
had
defined
within
the
doing
business
context
of
that
statute,
a
contract
to
be
performed
in
whole
or
in
part
in
texas,
it
is
quite
likely
that
he
federal
district
court
in
texas
would
have
proper
jurisdiction
over
that
action
so
long
as
it
did
not
fall
within
the
proscription
of
u-anchor
advertising,
inc.
versus
burt.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
under
the
general
venue
statute,
your
honor?
under
the
general
venue
statute
then
you
would
be
proper
where
all
the
defendants
resided,
or
where
the
act
or
transaction
that
is
the
subject
matter
occurred.
and
in
this
instance,
while
the
loan
was
sought
in
texas,
it
would
appear
from
the
hypothetical
you
have
posed
that
the
default
occurred
in
idaho
and
the
venue
would
therefore
be
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
that
is,
you
have
there
a
situation
of
a
weight
of
context
problem,
where
one
of
the
acts
in
furtherance
--
if
that
is
the
operative
fact,
the
fault
statement
and
its
transmission
into
texas,
then
yes.
there
are
cases
which
hold
the
venue
would
be
proper
in
texas.
although
under
a
weighing
of
context
analysis,
it
might
also
be
deemed
proper
that
venue
would
be
laid
in
idaho.
if
that
were
the
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
well,
it
will
be
in
idaho
under
defendants
where
the
defendants
resided.
but
as
far
as
the
where
the
act
or
transaction
occurred,
i
think
that
you
can
have
it
either
in
idaho
or
in
texas
where
there
is
a
deliberate
fraudulent
activity,
because
in
that
context
which
you
pose
your
honor,
there
you
have
a
deliberate
action
by
the
defendant
which
he
wants
to
have
a
jurisdiction
causing
effect
in
texas.
that's
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart
that
has
been
one
of
the
problems
of
this
case
from
the
beginning.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
it's
been
our
contention
that
there
are
several
distinct
criteria
which
must
be
met.
that
there
are
three
criteria
which
must
be
met
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
must
be
met
under
the
constitution
as
well
--
well
there
are
criteria
that
must
be
met
under
the
constitution.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
due
process
standards.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
there
are
three
criteria
which
must
be
met
under
the
federal
securities
act,
jurisdiction
and
venue
provision
and
there
are
special
criteria
which
must
be
met
under
the
texas
long-arm
statute.
under
the
securities
act,
jurisdiction
and
venue
statute
there
must
be
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
has
been
alleged
that
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
the
state
officials
in
enforcing,
or
being
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
a
state
law
allegedly
in
conflict
with
federal
law,
rises
somehow
to
the
dignity
of
a
violation
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
and
that
therefore,
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
next,
it
has
been
said
that
there
is
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
officials
because
the
action
that
they
took
was
having
in
effect
on
a
corporation
in
texas,
and
that
venue
was
proper
in
texas
because
that
was
the
district
where
the
effect
of
the
action
in
idaho
was
felt.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
absolutely
correct.
there
is
the
one
additional
problem
with
that
in
that
the
personal
jurisdiction
that
was
alleged
under
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
was
alleged
because
of
the
further
allegation
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
that
they
violated
the
act,
because
of
the
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
there
still
is
the
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
under
the
texas
long-arm
statute,
that
that
is
the
crux
of
the
contention
that
they
did
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
white
that
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
white
that
is
correct.
it
provides
for
nationwide
service
of
process.
we
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
that
would
give
personal
jurisdiction
in
a
court
where
the
due
process
standards
were
properly
applied.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
and
there
again,
we
go
to
the
crux
of
the
argument.
it
has
been
the
contention
that
sometimes
in
the
case
that
due
process
does
not
obtain
in
an
action
such
as,
as
broad
under
section
27
of
the
securities
act,
because
there
is
nationwide
service
of
process.
and
therefore
a
state
official
can
be
served
anywhere
where
a
court
can
issue
that
process.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
absolutely
mr.
justice
stewart.
anybody
can
be
served
by
the
court.
but
that
threshold
question
there
is,
is
that
the
proper
court
to
issue
the
service?
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
and
that's
the
crux
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
that
is
a
matter
of
the
--
it's
a
matter
of
whether
one
wants
to
call
it
venue
or
proper
assertion
of
personal
jurisdiction.
it
is
whether
that
is
the
proper
court.
that's
the
purpose
of
trying
to
stop
the
form
shopping.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
that
is
what
the
statute
said,
then
i
would
still
try
to
be
here
before
you
saying
that
that
statute
in
assessing
personal
jurisdiction
on
such
a
broad
scope
was
missing
the
very
important
due
process
requirement
that
allows
the
federal
court
to
hear
the
case
in
the
first
place.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
no.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
that's
the
whole
point.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
absolutely
not
your
honor,
and
that's
the
whole
point.
if
this
were
brought
in
the
district
of
idaho,
and
for
some
reason
the
idaho
officials
had
to
be
served
in
hawaii
or
alaska
or
wherever,
nationwide
service
of
process,
absolutely
no
problem
whatsoever.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that's
where
the
claim
or
the
act
in
violation
occur,
is
to
where
the
venue
of
the
case
is
laid.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
all
of
this
is
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
--
directed
to
jurisdiction
under
section
27
of
the
security
exchange
act.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
that
was
one
basis
for
jurisdiction,
and
the
other
basis
--
the
one
basis
for
jurisdiction
over
the
state
officials
was
section
27
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
the
alternative
basis
for
jurisdiction
over
the
state
officials
was
under
the
long-arm
--
texas
long-arm
statute
and
its
accompanying
venue
statute.
so
what
the
two
courts
below
found
was
that
jurisdiction
was
proper
in
the
northern
district
of
texas
by
coming
down
these
two
avenues,
either
one
of
them.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
if,
if
this
court
would
sustain
either
one
of
those
then
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct,
but
it's
our
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
absolutely
your
honor.
but
it's
our
contention
that
both
of
them
are
absolutely
wrongly
decided
because
both
of
them
misapplied
not
only
the
due
process
standards,
but
fail
to
come
to
grips
with
the
doing
business
prerequisite
on
the
one
hand
and
the
texas
long-arm
statute.
and
created
this
incredible
fiction
that
state
officials
who
were
enforcing
a
state
law
in
idaho
themselves
regulators
of
securities
transaction
were
somehow
guilty
of
the
same
type
of
activity
that
people
who
were
subject
to
the
williams
act
and
the
other
portions
of
the
securities
exchange
act
violate.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
yes.
if
the
prerequisites
that
you
say,
if
there
has
been
a
violation,
truly
a
violation,
if
it
--
the
statute
were
framed
in
such
a
way
the
law,
the
underlying
law
were
framed
in
such
a
way
that
a
violation
truly
could
be
said
to
have
occurred,
yes
that
congress
can
structure
it
how
they
want
to.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
you
have
violated
it,
mr.
justice
white,
any
place
in
the
united
states.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
but
the
venue
would
not
necessarily
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
if
you
violated
it
at
all,
but
then
you
would
not
necessarily
be
proper
in
the
united
states
then
you're
back
to
venue.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it's
my
contention
the
attorney
general
is
properly
here.
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
although
the
attorney
general
did
not
make
the
formal
appeal
from
the
district
court
decision,
at
all
times
during
the
--
in
the
context
and
in
the
writings
of
the
fifth
circuit,
it
treated
the
officials.
and
the
plural
was
that
both
of
them
were
before
the
court.
it
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
related
to
both
the
officials
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
attorney
general
is
properly
before
this
court,
because
the
fifth
circuit
wrongly
or
rightly
certainly
did
assert
jurisdiction
over
him
and
adjudged
the
case
with
regard
to
him.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
in
the
summary
of
argument,
my
--
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
in
the
summary
of
argument,
my
printer
got
michigan
and
there
--
in
my
argument
he
did
it
right
in
minnesota.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
as
a
preliminary
matter,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
typewritten
brief
of
the
securities
exchange
commission
was
only
received
by
as
on
the
5th
of
april
with
corrections
on
the
9th
of
april.
the
printed
brief
we
were
able
to
pick
up
a
copy
here
yesterday,
have
not
received
it
yet
and
i
would
like
to
request
that
i
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
that
brief
in
a
written
form
if
the
court
would
grant
me
that
opportunity.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
one
of
the
frustrations
that
the
idaho
appellants
have
in
this
case
is
that
the
securities
exchange
commission
where
it
had
a
real
opportunity
to
provide
enlightenment
for
this
court
as
to
what
section
27
really
involves
and
what
section
28
conflict
may
mean
in
their
terms
ignored
those
issues.
and
like
the
courts
below,
because
of
the
fascination
of
the
merits,
which
certainly
are
fascinating
left
right
into
the
constitutional
questions.
but
unfortunately
in
doing
that
they
used
some
of
the
clichés
and
terms
that
have
been
used
all
along
with
regard
to
these
state
laws
which
have
had
a
salutary
effect.
talk
about
the
term
delays,
state
laws
have
prolonged
the
period
during
which
tender
offers
are
open.
the
net
result
of
that
has
been
in
the
period
between
1974
and
1976,
a
$1.2
billion
premium
to
the
shareholders
as
a
result
of
that
extended
period
of
time.
but
the
point
that
we
really
have
focused
here
is
that
we
have
a
texas
corporation
that
wanted
to
take
over
a
controlling
interest
in
a
corporation
that
was
subject
to
jurisdiction
under
the
idaho
corporate
takeover
law,
and
the
texas
corporation,
the
corporation
with
operations
in
texas
knew
and
recognized
that
idaho
law
was
going
to
have
jurisdiction.
they
came
to
idaho
to
submit
themselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
idaho
law,
and
then
when
they
didn't
get
the
immediate
approval
that
they
wanted,
their
reaction
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
the
idaho
law
was
down
in
texas.
and
that
is
unfortunately
what
creates
the
problem
in
this
case.
we
shouldn't
be
having
to
be
concerned
about
defending
the
action
in
texas
because
it
shouldn't
have
been
brought
in
texas.
it
should
have
been
brought
in
idaho.
and
if
a
corporation
like
great
western
united
wants
to
do,
as
it
does,
business
in
many
states,
then
it
should
be
prepared
to
conform
to
the
problems
that
it
may
be
presented
with
by
the
laws
of
those
states.
and
if
it
has
constitutional
challenges
to
the
laws
of
those
states,
it
is
perfectly
free
to
go
into
the
federal
courts
in
those
states
or
the
state
courts
in
those
states
and
raise
those
constitutional
challenges.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
what
the
respondent
wanted
to
do
was
not
only
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
peter
e.
heiser,
jr.
exactly.
and
under
the
rationale
advanced
by
the
courts
below
then
because
of
the
effect
in
all
of
the
other
49
states,
they
more
than
likely
could've
brought
suit
in
any
of
the
other
49
states,
and
we
could've
been
defending
an
action
in
vermont
or
hawaii
or
alaska
or
florida
as
well
as
texas
because
great
western
united
wanted
to
secure
shares
of
stock
from
shareholders
in
those
states.
so
the
problem
becomes
the
forum
shopping
problem
and
that
really
is
not
what
we
feel
the
federal
law
was
designed
for,
and
it's
certainly
isn't
what
we
feel
that
the
texas
long-arm
statute
and
the
accompanying
federal
venue
statute
were
designed
for.
that's
the
whole
point.
the
u-anchor
case
that
the
texas
supreme
court
recently
brought
or
recently
decided
that
construe
the
texas
long-arm
statute,
it
is
absolutely
true
that
they
said
that
the
texas
long-arm
statute
goes
to
the
full
limits
of
due
process.
but
what
was
the
context
of
the
case?
a
contract,
one
of
the
specifically
defined
terms
that
constitutes
doing
business
under
the
texas
long-arm
statute.
the
threshold
first
level
of
inquiry
under
the
texas
long-arm
statute
was
satisfied.
so
they
didn't
have
to
waste
time
on
deciding
whether
it
was
an
act
of
doing
business
in
texas,
because
it
fell
within
the
actual
definition.
but
what
the
court
did
do
in
u-anchor
was
finding
that
yes,
it
technically,
the
facts
technically
satisfy
our
jurisdictional
prerequisite
in
the
texas
long-arm
statute
as
a
doing
business
context
--
i
see
i'm
out
of
time.
thank
you,
your
honor.
