mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
here
the
interest
of
great
western
united
corporation,
the
appellee.
in
march
of
1977,
as
mr.
heiser
has
stated,
great
western
united
corporation
proposed
an
interstate
tender
offer
for
shares
of
stock
of
sunshine
mining
company.
great
western
is
a
delaware
corporation
with
its
headquarters
and
principal
ownership
in
dallas,
texas.
sunshine
mining
company
was
and
is
a
washington
corporation
with
business
operations
in
idaho,
in
maryland
and
in
new
york.
and
i
mentioned
the
fact
that
sunshine
had
its
place
of
incorporation
in
washington,
because
washington
had
and
has
no
state
takeover
statute.
the
shares
of
sunshine
stock
were
held
by
citizens
across
the
nation
about
2.5%
residing
in
idaho,
about
6%
in
washington,
some
7%
in
texas
and
elsewhere.
shares
were
lifted
and
traded
on
the
facilities
of
the
national
securities
marketplace.
great
western
was
proposing
to
pay
a
premium
over
the
market
of
$15.75
per
share
for
up
to
two
million
of
those
shares.
with
that
backdrop,
great
western
complied
in
all
respects
with
the
provisions
of
federal
law
governing
the
regulation
of
interstate
cash
tender
offers
pursuant
to
the
williams
act
amendments
to
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
nevertheless,
because
sunshine
had
operations
in
these
other
three
states;
idaho,
maryland,
and
new
york
and
each
one
of
those
states
had
a
state
takeover
statute,
great
western
could
not
make
the
offer
upon
filing
with
the
securities
exchange
commission
its
schedule
13d,
now
a
14d-1.
the
idaho
act,
which
is
typical
of
state
takeover
statute,
contains
and
express
extra
territorial
provision
which
states
that
no
tender
offer
can
be
made
for
shares
of
a
target
company,
as
defined
in
the
act,
anywhere
--
that
is
anywhere
in
the
world
to
any
shareholder,
until
the
idaho
statute
has
been
complied
with.
now
the
extra
territorial
application
of
that
statute
combined
with
the
fact
that
maryland
and
new
york
had
similar
statutes
constitute
the
most
critical
facts
which
permeate
all
of
the
issues
before
this
court
to
this
day.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
having
substantial
assets
in
idaho.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
this
was
principle
place
of
business
and
assets.
there
was
an
office
as
well
as
the
mining
operation
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
no
question
that
it
was
covered.
but
i
also
would
make
the
point
that
the
triggering
mechanism
of
the
idaho
statute
was
not
the
presence
of
any
idaho
shareholder
of
sunshine.
it
was
rather
the
business
contacts
between
sunshine
and
the
state.
i
feel
that
i
should
turn
to
the
questions
of
jurisdiction
and
venue
because
that
was
all
that
was
opened
with,
and
i'm
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
any
other
state
statutes
other
than
state
takeover
statutes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
think
all
but
about
five
have
this
same
extra
territorial
reach,
and
i
think
there
are
32
states
now
which
have
state
takeover
statutes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
the
district
court
had
personal
jurisdiction
over
this
case
and
venue
was
proper.
great
western
had
two
avenues
available,
as
has
been
discussed.
one
avenue
was
utilizing
the
general
venue
statute,
1391
(b)
and
the
texas
long-arm
statute.
the
other
avenue,
if
we
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
1934
act,
an
issue
of
course
which
is
being
controverted,
was
through
the
nationwide
service
of
process
under
the
provisions
of
section
27
of
the
1934
act
and
service
in
accordance
with
rule
4.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
had
to
show
under
section
27
that
an
act
or
transaction
had
occurred
within
the
district
which
constituted
a
violation
or
breach
of
duty.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
in
any
such
district
referring
back
to
the
leading
sentence
concerning
“a
criminal
proceeding
maybe
brought
in
the
district
where
in
any
act
or
transaction
following
--
constituting
the
violation
occurred.”
now
that's
the
criminal
proceeding.
and
then
you
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
refers
back
to
the
criminal
district
as
one
place
and
then
goes
further.
and
the
criminal
district
is
where
the
act
or
transaction
complained
of
occurred.
as
i
was
saying
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
and
breach
of
duty,
if
it
may
be
characterized
that
way.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes,
yes.
would
you
like
me
to
do
that
now
or
wait?
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
alright.
section
28
(a)
of
the
1934
act
addresses
itself
specifically
to
the
question
of
what
securities
regulators
can
do.
it
reserved
to
state
securities
commissioners
or
their
counterparts,
the
jurisdiction
within
their
states
over
securities
transactions,
so
long
as
the
activities
of
those
commissioners
were
not
in
conflict
with
federal
law.
the
language
itself
speaks
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
is
preserved,
so
long
as
it
doesn't
conflict.
thomas
corcoran,
one
of
the
principal
draftsmen
of
the
1934
act,
stated
at
the
time
that
section
28
(a)
was
adopted
that
the
purpose
was
to
establish
and
to
utilize
traditional
preemption,
under
the
supremacy
clause,
statement
was
that
“the
state
may
legislate
in
addition
but
may
not
legislate
inconsistently.”
it
was
the
very
foundation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
it
is
our
view
that
the
attempted
enforcement
by
appellants
in
this
case
of
a
statute
which
conflicted
with
the
substantive
provisions,
the
disclosure
provisions
and
indeed
the
approaches
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
williams
act
amendments,
constitutes
a
breach
of
the
very
affirmative
duty
which
was
placed
upon
securities
regulators
not
to
enact
statutes
which
conflicted.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
would
view
it
differently.
i
would
view
it
in
terms
of
as
the
fifth
circuit
said,
the
commerce
clause
is
expressed
only
as
an
affirmative
grant
to
congress
but
it
contains
self-executing
restrictions
on
state
power.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
under
the
1934
act.
if
it
is
a
statute
which
it
conflicts
with
the
federal
law
as
embraced
within
the
securities
exchange
act
of
19
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
shareholders
of
sunshine
had
the
right
to
be
free
from
regulation
which
blocked
this
tender
offer
until
it
was
--
until
the
state
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
my
client
of
course
wanted
the
opportunity.
i'm
not
saying
we
had
a
right
to
make
a
tender
offer
free
of
state
regulation,
i
think
states
can
regulate
in
certain
areas
in
tender
offers.
i
don't
think
that
this
particular
statute
with
its
infirmities
will
stand
constitutional
muster.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
it
would
depend
on
where
the
defendant
was
acting.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
normally,
you
would
go
to
where
the
defendant
is
located.
now
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
you
could,
and
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
well
we
are
relying
upon
constitutional
privileges
as
well
as
a
violation
of
the
act.
and,
well
i've
referred
a
moment
ago
to
the
extra
territorial
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
commerce
clause
which
we
believe
the
idaho
act
violates.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
think
there
is
some
element
of
due
process
in
here,
but
that
was
not
specifically
how
we
brought
our
suit.
a
state
can
not
regulate
the
affairs
of
another
state.
that
is
certainly
the
due
process
argument
which
is
implicit.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
think
what
the
district
court
in
texas
was
doing
was
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
was
making
the
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
and
our
complaint
is
that
the
idaho
regulators
by
seeking
to
regulate
extra
territorially
were
damaging
the
plaintiffs,
the
federal
plaintiffs
who
brought
the
suit
in
the
northern
district
of
texas
where
the
very
restraint
occurred.
it's
tit
for
tat,
its
fair
play.
if
the
idaho
regulators
stay
at
home
and
regulate
within
their
state,
they're
only
going
to
be
subject
to
being
sued
in
their
state.
if
they
purport
to
regulate
for
the
rest
of
the
world
and
say
“you
can't
make
a
tender
offer
great
western.
you
can't
buy
a
single
shore
of
sunshine
stock
from
any
shareholder
anywhere
until
you
come
comply
with
our
law
and
you
have
to
wrap
all
these
commerce
around
us.”
then
they
should
be
subject
to
suit
in
the
place
where
they
caused
their
consequences.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes,
i
do
under
the
1966
amendments
to
the
general
venue
statute
allowing
suit
to
be
brought
where
the
claim
arose.
for
the
first
time
the
federal
plaintiff
could
bring
multi-defendants
into
a
single
forum
just
as
we
did
in
this
case
through
the
application
of
the
general
venue
statute.
we
were
faced
with
new
york,
maryland
and
idaho
at
the
incipient
stages
of
this
litigation.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
very
inconvenient
for
someone
and
we
do
not
think
that
any
policy
of
judicial
economy
would
be
served
by
great
western
being
required
to
sue
one
time
in
idaho,
one
time
in
maryland
and
one
time
in
new
york.
particularly
when
the
focal
point
of
all
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
approximately
32
or
33,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
number.
mr.
heiser
says
36,
i'll
take
his
count.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes,
right.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
no.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
think
it's
a
little
broader
than
that.
the
--
mr.
baptie
sent
a
letter
into
texas
which
required
the
disclosure
of
substantial
additional
information
over
and
above
federal
law.
and
one
--
or
two
of
the
disclosures
which
he
sought,
if
we
had
complied
would've
triggered
federal
enforcement
action.
we
would've
violated
federal
law
if
we've
complied,
that's
one
point.
accompanying
the
letter
was
an
order.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
that
order
had
been
entered
without
any
notice,
hearing,
posting
a
bond
or
other
security
which
is
held
by
both
courts
below
restrain
great
western
from
going
forward
anywhere.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
think
by
seeking
to
enforce
this
statute,
he
breached
the
duty
or
violation
either
one
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
no
he
did
not
commit
a
crime.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
but
it
is
repeated
when
the
civil
jurisdiction
provisions
of
section
28
come
into
play.
the
first
sentence
is
“in
the
district
where
the
violation
occurred
in
criminal
proceedings”
then
it
goes
to
“may
also
be
brought”
--
and
this
is
the
civil
side
of
the
docket
as
i
read
it
your
honor,
where
the
violation
of
a
civil
violation
occurred,
where
the
breach
of
duty
occurred
or
to
collect
a
liability
--
enforce
a
liability.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
where
any
act
or
transaction
occurred
which
would
constitute
the
violation.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i'm
yielding.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
no
i
do
not
think
a
crime
was
committed.
i
do
not
and
i
think
it's
important
for
me
to
remember
and
advise
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
where
venue
has
been
proper
under
section
27,
although
there
was
no
criminal
violation
involved.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
though
not
in
this
court,
not
in
this
court
but
in
the
lower
courts.
and
i
think
the
reasoning
of
the
lower
courts
is
sound
in
the
16
(b)
area
for
example.
suits
may
be
brought
under
section
27
to
collect
the
profits
which
must
be
discoursed
for
illegal
short
swing
trading.
but
there
is
no
criminal
sanction
for
such
prohibited
activity.
but
the
lower
courts
have
reasoned
that
it
doesn't
mean
only
that
there
has
to
be
a
criminal
violation
under
section
27,
it
can
also
be
a
civil
violation
or
breach
of
duty
or
something
that
would
lead
to
the
enforcement
of
a
liability.
if
i
may
--
if
i've
answered
that
question,
i'll
get
back
to
this
question
of
the
first
wrap
which
we
took,
which
was
the
general
venue
statute
where
the
claim
arose.
we
believe
that
the
northern
district
of
texas
was
the
focal
point
of
all
of
appellant's
regulatory
activity
as
well
as
that
of
maryland
and
new
york.
jurisdiction
was
obtained
under
the
texas
long-arm
statute
which
has
been
definitively
construed
by
the
texas
supreme
court,
in
u-anchor
versus
burt,
as
going
to
the
full
limitation
of
constitutional
due
process.
judge
dietrich
in
writing
for
the
texas
supreme
court
on
that
state
issue
said
that
“the
construction
does
not
involve
and
abstruse
definitions
of
what
constitutes
doing
business.”
the
united
states
district
court
which
heard
this
case
said
“the
statute
has
no
commercial
import.”
appellants
would
argue
that
they
were
not
doing
business.
the
statute
uses
doing
business
as
a
pickup
to
pull
in
every
activity
other
than
what
is
already
specifically
described,
and
as
i
said
goes
to
the
full
limits
of
constitutional
due
process.
in
any
event
the
duty,
as
the
fifth
circuit,
i
mean
the
business
of
the
idaho
officials,
as
judge
wisdom
said
was
to
regulate.
hearing
oral
argument
has
been
held
to
be
doing
business.
i
don't
have
this
case
in
my
brief,
and
i'd
like
to
put
in
to
the
record,
wisconsin
telephone
company
versus
wisconsin
department
industry,
labor
and
human
relations,
228
nw.2d,
at
649
wisconsin,
1975.
we
then
turn
to
a
minimum
contact
analysis
under
the
long-arm
statute.
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
activities
of
the
appellants
were
certainly
purposeful.
there
was
nothing
accidental
about
the
comment
letter
or
the
order
which
was
sent
in
which
restrained
this.
the
results
on
great
western
were
certainly
foreseeable,
they
could
certainly
see
that
if
they
restrained
this
--
it
restrained
this,
it
locked
up
the
funds,
lost
the
opportunity
to
go
forward.
the
cause
of
action
arose
directly
out
of
those
activities
of
the
idaho
regulators.
the
causing
of
purposeful
consequences
in
a
foreign
district
has
been
held
sufficient
under
many
applications
of
minimum
contact
analysis.
the
other
avenue
which
we
preceded
was
section
27,
its
interrelationship
with
section
28
(a),
our
view
and
the
courts
below
that
there
was
a
violation
or
a
breach
of
duty
by
the
enforcement
of
this
statute.
therefore,
minimum
contacts
analysis
was
not
required
because
we
had
from
congress
the
availability
of
nationwide
service
of
process.
the
sovereign
united
states
can
exercise
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
its
inhabitants.
it
would
only
be
a
minimum
contact
now
since
required
if
we've
been
seeking
to
sue
someone
outside
of
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states
and
its
territories.
under
the
section
27
construction
by
the
lower
courts,
the
act
or
transaction
does
not
have
to
be
the
core
of
any
wrongdoing
or
even
illegal,
as
long
as
it's
something
more
than
immaterial.
here,
the
most
material
aspect
of
the
idaho
regulation
was
with
--
was
happened
in
texas,
that
is
the
order
which
enjoined
us.
and
we
would
further
say
that
even
if
a
minimum
contact
or
weight
of
effects
analysis
were
proper
under
section
27,
it
would
be
satisfied
under
the
same
analysis
under
the
texas
long-arm
statute.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
we
would
think
so.
great
western's
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
in
order
to
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
1934
act,
we
would
have
to
find
a
section,
yes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes,
for
violating
the
federal
right,
the
federal
regulation
of
tender
offers
as
expressed
in
the
williams
act
through
a
statute
which
conflicts.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
do
not
think
it
automatically
does.
i
think
that
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
it
was
great
western's
tender
offer
which
was
in
fact
stopped.
it
was
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
i
understand
the
cause
of
action
--
there
have
been
implied
causes
of
action
under
the
1934
act,
and
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
not
under
this
section,
no.
no,
this
is
not
--
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
in
that
respect.
the
--
i
think
it
also
maybe
important
for
me
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
something
i'm
bringing
late
but
nevertheless
i
think
it
would
be
sending
the
court
with
one
to
look
at
in
its
own
motion.
idaho
came
here,
appellants
came
here
under
the
provisions
of
section
1254
(2)
but
that
is
by
way
of
an
appeal
as
opposed
to
making
an
application
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
that
appeal
invoked
this
court's
obligatory
jurisdiction
and
under
the
language
of
the
statute,
precludes
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
review
on
the
appeal
is
limited
to
the
federal
questions.
there
is
no
authority
on
how
wide
that
federal
question
issue
is.
we
would
submit
it
may
be.
and
again
i
think
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression,
that
the
only
federal
issue
is
the
validity
of
the
idaho
statute
which
was
held
unconstitutional,
which
furnishes
the
basis
for
the
utilization
of
1254
(2).
if
that
is
so,
then
the
provisions
of
the
issues
brought
here
on
jurisdiction
and
venue
are
not
the
federal
question
which
was
to
be
reviewed
under
the
provisions
of
1254
(2).
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
may
i
say
that
we
were
not
basing
our
right
to
sue
on
just
the
1934
act.
we
were
also
basing
our
right
to
sue
on
constitutional
privileges
under
the
supremacy
clause
and
under
the
commerce
clause.
there
we
felt
we
certainly
had
standing.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
that's
true.
if
we
don't
have
standing
to
bring
this
action
because
of
violation
of
28
(a)
we
can't
use
27,
and
we
have
to
go
to
the
other
alternative,
which
was
the
general
venue
statute
plus
the
application
of
texas
long-arm.
that's
correct.
in
brief
fashion,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
bear
with
me
for
a
moment
on
a
preemption
analysis
very
quickly.
the
williams
act
was
brought
into
play
in
1968
after
congress
had
been
deliberating
the
subject
for
some
three
years.
it
was
not
an
area
which
had
been
regulated
before
by
either
states
or
the
federal
government.
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
williams
act
amendments,
there
was
one
state
takeover
statute,
virginia
which
had
been
--
had
become
effective
about
two
months
before.
congress
said
it
closed
the
gap
in
an
area
which
had
not
been
regulated.
cash
tender
offer
phenomenon
really
didn't
occur
until
the
mid
60's
or
maybe
early
60's,
so
this
was
not
an
area
which
had
been
traditionally
state-regulated.
congress
took
a
market
approach
allowing
the
tender
offeror
to
make
his
filing
and
go
direct
to
the
shareholder
at
the
same
time
that
the
incumbent
management
was
going
direct
to
the
shareholder
to
tell
their
story
to
let
the
shareholder
make
his
informed
decision
about
taking
cash
for
his
shares.
as
a
result,
congress
considered
but
rejected
prior
agency
approvals,
considered
but
rejected
pre-effective
filing
requirements.
idaho
took
exactly
the
opposite
course,
and
has
an
extensive
hearing
and
pre-filing
requirement
which
causes
the
very
delay
which
congress
didn't
want
to
happen
because
of
the
weapon
it
would
give
to
incumbent
management,
to
discourage
delay,
take
defensive
maneuvers
to
defeat
a
tender
offer.
congress
also
did
not
seek
to
have
the
shareholder
decision
made
by
any
fiduciary.
idaho
took
the
opposite
approach
where
the
tender
offeror
must
satisfy
either
the
target
management
and
get
their
recommendation,
or
the
state
regulators.
and
this
particular
statute
suffers
a
further
vice
and
that
the
incumbent
management
can
determine
whether
the
state
regulator
acts
or
not.
if
they
accept
the
offer,
state
regulator
can
not
call
a
hearing.
if
they
do
accept
--
if
they
set
the
offer,
you
can't
call
a
hearing.
if
they
don't
accept
the
hearing
--
the
offer,
they
have
to
call
a
hearing.
the
enforcement
of
these
differing
substantive
and
disclosure
provisions
between
idaho
and
the
williams
act
and
the
difference
and
approaches
as
found
by
the
majority
opinion
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
by
the
united
states
district
judge
demonstrates
that
this
tips
the
balance
of
regulatory
power
in
favor
of
the
target
management,
which
was
not
the
policy
congress
had
in
mind
and
the
idaho
statute
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
full
accomplishment
and
execution
of
congressional
purposes.
the
preemption
analysis
was
just
one
of
the
analysis
that
the
courts
below
went
through,
just
tells
one
half
of
the
story.
the
commerce
clause
was
also
violated,
we
believe,
by
idaho's
direct
regulation
out
of
state
of
a
cash
tender
offer
involving
some
$31
million.
great
western
and
shareholders
throughout
the
country
could
not
do
business
with
each
other
until
the
idaho
law
was
satisfied.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
it
would
then
operate
like
a
state
blue
sky
law.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
the
constitutionality
of
which
this
court
upheld
in
1917
in
hall
versus
geiger-jones.
the
effect
of
the
idaho
regulation
put
great
western
to
a
hobson's
choice.
we
could
either
ignore
the
letter
that
came
in
to
the
northern
district
of
texas
and
the
order,
and
risk
substantial
civil
and
criminal
penalties.
or
we
could
comply
and
accept
the
delay
and
the
additional
burdens
and
the
jeopardy
which
would
be
caused.
we
chose
to
go
forward
with
the
lawsuit
because
we
believe
that
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
had
interfered
with
the
area
of
free
trade,
which
had
been
established
by
the
commerce
clause,
and
that
there
were
no
legitimate
local
interest
being
protected.
idaho
has
stated
in
the
brief
that
they're
protecting
shareholders,
but
that
analysis
is
as
--
is
a
little
thin.
the
idaho
statute
does
not
require
the
presence
in
idaho
of
any
idaho
investor
in
a
target
company.
so
the
very
class
of
persons
idaho
says
they're
protecting
don't
have
to
exist.
even
if
--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
we
believe
that
the
delegation
by
idaho
under
the
idaho
act
to
the
target
management
of
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
idaho
act
would
come
into
play
constituted
an
unlawful
delegation
to
a
vitally
interested
private
party,
and
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
as
expressed
in
1983.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
discrimination
involved
if
an
outside
party
is
subject
to
state
regulation
only
at
the
behest
of
another
private
party.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
we
have
not
brought
that
forward
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
we've
abandoned
it.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes,
but
not
only
under
1983.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes
and
the
supremacy
clause
--
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
yes
,sir.
mr.
ivan
irwin,
jr.
i'll
reinstate
it.
