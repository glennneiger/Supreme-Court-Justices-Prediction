justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
sole
basis
of
this
claim
of
fact
that
the
federal
law
preempted
the
idaho
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
the
mere
existence
of
an
idaho
statute
which
might
ultimately
be
determined
to
preempt
--
to
be
preempted
by
a
federal
statute
wouldn't
mean
that
the
state
official
charged
with
administering
would
be
“violating”
the
federal
statute
within
section
27?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
heiser,
what
if
this
case
had
arisen
with
a
plaintiff
as
one
who
is
contending
that
the
takeover
should
not
be
permitted
because
the
corporation
had
not
complied
with
the
idaho
statute?
that
plaintiff
lived
in
texas,
otherwise
had
standing.
is
there
any
reason
why
in
that
sort
of
a
lawsuit
where
their
idaho
officials
weren't
joined
as
parties,
the
district
court
in
texas
couldn't
hold
that
the
federal
statute
preempted
the
idaho
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
given
all
the
other
necessary
requirements
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
venue,
only
the
federal
district
court
sitting
in
idaho
could
hold
an
idaho
statute
preempted
by
a
federal
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
congress
says
in
so
many
words
that
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
act,
as
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
assume,
process
may
be
served
and
personal
jurisdiction
may
be
obtained
in
any
one
of
the
93
judicial
districts
in
the
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
don't
you
agree
that
if
your
opponents
can
sustain
either
one
of
those,
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
--
that's
answering
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
earlier
asked
you
to
assume.
but
supposing
that
they
go
into
the
northern
district
of
texas
and
alleged
that
you
have
--
that
you
have
made
--
violated
the
securities
act
and
alleged
venue
and
jurisdiction
under
section
27.
now,
don't
you
think
that
congress
has
a
right
to
allow
that
sort
of
jurisdiction
and
venue
if
it's
expressly
says
so,
and
if
it
can
satisfactorily
--
if
the
plans
can
satisfactorily
make
out
a
case
that
you
have
violated
the
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
texas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
deny
that
a
private
citizen
could
be
made
subject
to
suit
anywhere
in
the
united
states
by
congress,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
congress
just
said
in
so
many
words
there
should
be
nationwide
service
of
process
on
everyone
who
is
alleged
to
have
violated
statute
when
didn't
purport
to
make
any
finding
of
reasonableness,
they
just
--
this
is
what
the
law
is
going
to
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know
us
better
than
to
think
we
would
want
to
manipulate
statute,
mrs.
juviler.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
even
there,
you
had
to
show
that
the
defendant
was
“found”,
did
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
will
you
turn
to
page
6
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
please,
where
i
believe
section
77
of
the
securities
act
is
sent
out
the
district.
it
begins
on
page
5
and
ends
on
page
6.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
talks
first
about
criminal
proceeding
and
then
it
says
“any
suit
or
action
to
enforce
at
any
liability.”
this
is
beginning
at
the
top
of
page
6,
“or
duty
created
by
this
chapter,
rules
and
regulations
there
under,
or
to
enjoin
any
violation
of
such
chapter
rules
and
regulation
maybe
brought
in
any
such
district
or
in
the
district
wherein
the
defendant
is
found.”
now
you
say
that
you
can
bring
it
in
a
district
where
the
defendant
is
found
or
in
such
district?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
civil
adds
on
--
is
broader
than
the
criminal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
affirmative
duty
was
placed
on
them?
your
talking
--
are
you
talking
about
28
(a)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
would
not
read
that
as
placing
any
affirmative
duty
on
them,
because
nothing
in
this
chapter
show
effect
the
jurisdiction
except
such
and
such.
now
that
may
negate
their
right
to
do
a
particular
one,
but
certainly
it
doesn't
place
any
duty
on
them,
do
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
yet
you're
relying
on
the
--
such
district
language
from
27
that
provides
for
criminal
jurisdiction,
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
it
says
“may
be
brought
in
any
such
district
or
in
the
district
wherein
the
defendant
is
found,
or
is
an
inhabitant
or
transacts
business.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
would
be
limited
by
the
vicinage
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
sixth
amendment
says
as
you
know
doubt
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
speedy
in
public
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
of
the
state
and
district
wherein
the
crime
shall
have
been
committed.
now,
i
take
that
congress
is
bound
by
that
in
allocating
criminal
jurisdiction
under
the
securities
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
you
think
a
crime
was
committed
in
texas
in
this
case
by
the
state
defendants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
this
court?
you
say
a
number
of
cases
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
authority
and
for
saying
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
you
have
to
go
back
to
find
out
what
congress
intended
that
you
have
a
private
cause
of
action,
rather
than
relating
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
have
been
--
if
we
ever
held
there
was
one
under
this
particular
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
had
no
right
to
sue
as
a
plaintiff
under
this
statute
then
there
was
never
any
occasion
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
idaho
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
certainly
couldn't
invoke
section
27
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
our
interest
is
in
identifying
the
proper
forum
for
the
suit,
i
suppose
your
argument
is
largely
wasted
then?
