chief
justice
warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
leroy
against
great
western
united
corporation.
before
you
proceed
counsel,
i
want
to
inform
the
counsel
in
united
states
against
batchelder,
the
solicitor
general's
office
and
mr.
bellows
that
we
will
not
reach
your
case
this
afternoon
and
you
may
be
excused
if
you
--
at
any
time
you
wish.
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
heiser.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
a
question
in
two
stages.
first,
suppose
the
idaho
company
borrowed
money
from
a
houston
bank
in
texas
and
as
usual
submitted
financial
statements,
and
defaulted
on
the
loan
and
suit
was
brought.
would
venue
lie
in
texas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
eliminate
the
texas
statute
from
the
hypothetical
and
have
the
same
loan
made,
financial
statement
submitted
and
it
turned
out
that
the
financial
statements
were
allegedly
false.
would
venue
lie
on
texas
independent
of
the
texas
long-arm
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
a
false
statement
was
rendered,
a
false
statement
was
delivered
to
texas,
to
the
bank,
rather
the
lender.
isn't
that
enough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
there's
no
question
about
it
being
in
idaho,
but
the
borrower
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
doesn't
determine
where
the
venue
is
going
to
lie.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
all
of
these
colloquies
address
to
the
federal
statute,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
our
case
is
involves
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
our
case
involves
the
texas
statute
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
speaking
of
attorney's
general,
i
think
in
your
brief,
you
have
ex
parte
young
as
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota,
sometimes
we
at
minnesota
might
be
glad
to
yield
that
michigan
as
you've
described
it.
but
--
or
one
of
the
briefs
did
i
think
yours
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
juviler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
juviler,
your
friend
mr.
heiser
in
response
to
justice
blackmun
said
very
definitely,
the
appellant
is
here.
could
he
have
taken
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
court
judgment,
could
he?
we
know
that
he
didn't,
if
i
recall
it
correctly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mrs.
juviler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
irwin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it's
inevitable
that
if
you
spread
that
over
widely,
it's
going
to
be
quite
inconvenient
for
someone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
easterbrook.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
heiser,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
respond
if
you
wish
in
the
usual
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
