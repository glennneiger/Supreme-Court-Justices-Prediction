justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
heiser,
are
we
talking
now
about
venue
or
jurisdiction,
and
are
we
talking
if
jurisdiction
over
the
person
or
over
the
subject
matter?
and
are
we
talking
as
a
matter
of
what's
permissible
under
the
constitution
or
what
is
provided
by
state
statute?
i've
been
lost
in
this
discussion.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
is
been
your
contention,
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
must
be
met
what?
under
the
constitution
or
under
some
state's
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
its
subject
--
it's
a
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
idaho
officials,
which
is
the
big
threshold
issue
here
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
personal
jurisdiction
over
them,
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
idaho
officials
whether
there
is
out
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
whether
there
can
be.
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
they
violated
the
act.
there's
still
a
threshold
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
whether
or
not
the
court
had
personal
jurisdiction
over
them,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
anybody
can
be
served
by
a
federal
court,
the
only
meets
and
bounds
of
our
nation.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
is
that
a
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
matter
of
venue
then?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
coverage
of
the
idaho
statute
was
of
a
corporations
with
their
principle
place
of
business
in
idaho,
corporations
incorporated
in
idaho
and
what
else?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
principle
place
of
business?
justice
potter
stewart
no
question
of
the
--
as
to
the
coverage
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
violates
it.
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
violating
a
duty
which
is
under
the
federal
law?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
same
token
of
course,
the
respondent
company
says
that
what
idaho
did
had
a
direct
impact
upon
what
the
respondent
wanted
to
do
in
the
state
of
texas.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
other
49
states
also.
