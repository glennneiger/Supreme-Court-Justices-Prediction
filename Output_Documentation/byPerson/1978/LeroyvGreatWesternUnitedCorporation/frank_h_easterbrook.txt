mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interest
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
this
case
is
in
determining
the
validity
of
the
application
of
state
takeover
laws,
rather
than
in
identifying
the
proper
forum
for
this
suit.
i
will
therefore
devote
my
time
to
the
commerce
and
supremacy
clause
arguments.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
my
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
my
argument
would
be
entirely
wasted
if
you
find
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
but
in
the
event
that
five
justices
concluded
there
is
jurisdiction,
i
think
the
commission
would
like
to
be
heard
on
the
merits.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
will
--
i'll
address
the
commerce
clause
first,
and
then
i'll
take
up
the
supremacy
clause
arguments.
the
point
of
the
commerce
clause
is
we
think
the
creation
of
a
common
market.
it
forbids
states
from
balkanizing
the
stream
of
commerce.
more
than
that,
it
forbids
states
from
reaching
outside
their
borders
to
affect
the
flow
of
commerce
elsewhere.
idaho's
law
affects
an
interstate
market
and
securities.
its
laws
law
applies
to
securities
that
are
being
traded
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
its
law
applies
to
an
offer
by
somebody
residing
in
texas
to
buy
shares
from
somebody
else
residing
in
texas.
and
the
application
of
this
law
doesn't
simply,
as
in
most
commerce
clause
cases
that
come
to
this
court
affect
local
commerce,
but
produce
ripples
elsewhere
that
are
felt
in
other
states.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
very
purpose
of
the
state
rule
is
to
reach
outside
the
borders
of
idaho
and
tell
people
in
texas,
in
new
york
and
florida
whether
and
when
they
can
buy
securities
from
one
another.
it's
as
if
the
state
passed
the
blue
sky
law
and
said
“ordinarily,
you
can
decide
not
to
deal
in
our
state
if
you
decide
not
to
file
our
state
registration
statement.”
but
we
conclude
that
in
order
to
protect
the
residents
of
idaho
from
being
eliminated
or
excluded
from
valuable
opportunities
to
buy
stock,
no
one
can
offer
stock
for
sale
in
texas
unless
he
files
a
registration
statement
and
sells
it
in
idaho
as
well.
otherwise,
our
residents
are
left
out.
idaho
indeed
extols
the
extra
territorial
reach
of
its
laws
as
being
justified
by
just
such
a
purpose.
that
kind
of
justification
has
been
rejected
by
this
court,
we
think.
maybe
that
the
best
example
of
that
is
baldwin
against
g.a.f.
seelig,
one
of
the
incredible
series
of
new
york
milk
cases
that
detained
this
court
for
some
20
years.
new
york
tried
to
increase
the
selling
price
of
milk
in
new
york
by
requiring
new
york
wholesalers
of
milk
to
treat
the
wholesale
price
of
milk,
even
if
bought
out
of
state,
the
same
as
the
new
york
control
price
of
milk.
as
the
court
analyzed
the
case,
new
york
was
trying
to
tell
buyers
and
sellers
in
vermont
what
price
they
should
charge
for
milk
if
the
milk
ended
up
in
new
york.
and
the
fact
that
the
milk
ended
up
in
new
york
produced
a
very
substantial
contact
with
the
state
of
new
york.
a
substantiality
of
which
was
not
disputed
by
any
one.
the
milk
had
contacts
with
new
york,
just
as
sunshine
has
substantial
contacts
with
idaho.
but
the
court
rejected
any
notion
that
new
york
could
attempt
to
influence
the
course
of
commerce
in
vermont
no
matter
how
much
the
course
of
commerce
in
vermont
might
ultimately
have
an
effect
on
what
happened
in
new
york.
that's
exactly
what
idaho
is
trying
to
do
here.
it's
trying
to
influence
the
course
of
conduct
in
texas
and
new
york
on
the
ground
that
that
conduct
ultimately
has
repercussions
in
idaho.
and
the
statute
fails
for
the
same
reason,
we
think.
but
even
if
the
statute
were
treated
as
one
that
applied
wholly
to
a
state's
domestic
commerce
and
merely
produced
its
ripples
elsewhere,
it
would
be
invalid
because
the
ripples
are
great
and
the
justifications
for
the
act
small.
idaho
argues
for
example
that
it
has
the
goal
of
protecting
idaho
shareholders.
one
of
the
anomalies
of
the
statute
though
is
that
it
has
--
it's
not
triggered
by
the
presence
of
any
shareholder
in
idaho,
would
apply
if
there
were
no
shareholder
in
idaho.
on
the
other
hand,
the
statute
does
not
apply
if
the
takeover
offer
is
consented
to
by
the
management
of
the
company,
even
if
the
management
of
the
company
is
found
in
washington
state.
and
so
in
those
cases,
idaho
shareholders
receive
no
protection.
what's
more
is
that
what
idaho
tries
to
do
in
a
case
like
this,
is
protect
the
2%
of
the
shareholders
who
live
in
idaho.
only
be
requiring
the
98%
of
the
shareholders
who
live
in
new
york
and
texas
and
florida
to
forego
what
they
may
find
to
be
a
valuable
opportunity.
the
only
other
justification
advanced
by
the
state
is
that
its
statute
will
protect
civic-minded
businesses,
or
local
commerce,
health
and
safety
and
the
like.
that
amounts
to,
we
think,
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
for
its
own
purpose.
it's
an
exaltation
of
the
values
of
local
isolationism
from
the
stream
of
commerce.
and
that's
the
kind
of
justification
that
was
rejected
in
philadelphia
against
new
jersey
last
term.
the
point
of
this
argument
has
been
that
idaho
has
had
substantial
extra
territorial
intent,
in
fact
in
scope
of
its
statute,
those
kinds
of
things
that
ought
to
be
regulated
by
congress,
if
they're
regulated
at
all.
in
fact,
congress
has
regulated
them
and
that
brings
me
to
the
point
under
the
supremacy
clause.
in
order
to
evaluate
the
argument
which
we
make
here
that
the
state
law
is
preempted
by
the
williams
act,
its
necessary
first
we
think
to
understand
why
people
make
tender
offers.
tender
offer
is
a
public
offer
to
buy
shares
at
more
than
they
will
fetch
in
the
market.
a
person
ordinarily
makes
such
an
offer
only
if
he's
persuaded
that
the
shares
will
be
worth
more
in
his
hands
than
they
are
worth
held
and
distributed
to
the
public
at
large.
that
may
be
because
incumbent
management
is
inefficient
and
mismanaging
the
company,
and
that
event,
the
value
of
the
shares
will
increase
if
new
management
is
substituted
by
the
offeror.
maybe
the
tax
considerations
would
make
the
shares
more
valuable
in
some
hands
than
others
if
for
example
the
target
has
some
operating
loss
carryovers.
whatever
the
reason,
and
there
may
be
many,
the
offeror
is
relying
on
an
increment
in
value.
the
problem
is
that
it's
very
costly
for
firms
to
go
out
and
identify
such
cases
where
there
may
be
an
increment
in
value,
and
they
don't
accept
those
costs
unless
there's
some
prospect
of
return.
and
the
prospect
of
return
has
to
be
discounted
by
the
risk
that
the
offer
will
be
a
failure.
the
greater
the
risk,
the
more
return
there
has
to
be
to
make
the
offer
worthwhile.
but
in
order
to
realize
the
gain
that
he's
identified,
the
offeror
has
to
make
the
public
offer
and
pay
more
than
the
shares
bring
in
the
market.
not
too
much
more
though,
and
this
is
the
difficulty
from
the
offeror's
point
of
view,
because
if
he
offers
the
entire
increment
of
profit
to
the
current
shareholders,
the
highest
possible
price,
there's
nothing
left
for
him.
no
incentive
to
do
the
searching.
no
incentive
to
make
the
offer.
and
without
an
offer
of
course,
shareholders
will
get
nothing
at
all.
so
the
closer
any
rule
tries
to
drive
the
price,
to
the
maximum
price,
to
what
its
worth
to
the
offeror,
the
less
likely
the
offer
is
to
occur
in
the
first
place,
the
more
likely
the
shareholder
is
to
end
up
with
nothing.
time
is
of
the
essence
in
the
tender
offer
process,
and
so
is
the
opportunity
to
have
a
fair
fight
between
the
offeror
and
the
incumbent
management.
it's
most
likely
that
the
incumbent
management
feels
its
own
personal
prerequisites
and
position
at
stake.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
powell,
there
is
substantial
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
congress
thought
that
tender
offers
were
quite
beneficial
if
conducted
under
a
set
of
rules
that
allowed
the
shareholders
to
make
an
informed
judgment.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
--
that's
right.
the
difficulty
lies
in
determining
how
that
judgment
is
going
to
be
made.
one
can
construct
the
set
of
rules,
there's
going
to
be
an
offer
there's
going
to
be
a
response
by
the
target
management.
one
can
construct
a
set
of
rules
under
which
someone,
usually
the
shareholders
have
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
the
offer
is
beneficial
or
not,
whether
there
is
that
incremented
value.
and
the
williams
act
was
an
attempt
to
set
up
that
set
of
rules
under
which
shareholders
could
make
that
determination.
the
prorative
provisions,
the
seven-day
withdrawal
provisions,
the
disclosure
provisions
were
intended
to
allow
shareholders
to
make
that
judgment.
but
it
was
a
judgment
that
was
to
be
made
in
the
context
of
information
from
both
offeror
and
the
target
management,
the
ultimate
decision
to
be
decision
to
be
made
by
the
shareholders.
the
difficulty
in
regulating
in
that
way
is
to
set
up
a
system
of
regulations
so
that
the
shareholder
can
make
that
choice,
without
at
the
same
time
so
setting
up
regulatory
rules
that
the
number
of
beneficial
tender
offers
is
reduced
and
there
are
fewer
opportunities
for
shareholders
to
make
their
judgments.
congress'
assessment
was
that
the
best
combination
of
protection
for
shareholders
and
insurance
that
tender
offers
would
not
be
eliminated
all
together,
was
a
set
of
disclosure
rules
coupled
with
prompt
start
of
the
offer.
and
congress
explicitly
considered
and
just
as
explicitly
rejected
a
variety
of
pre-offer
notification
rules
or
a
variety
of
rules
of
the
sort
that
would
require
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
pass
on
the
adequacy
of
disclosure
before
the
tender
offer
could
begin.
but
given
the
necessity
of
making
the
kind
of
balance,
actually
a
rather
fine
tuned
one
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
williams
act,
it
must
follow
we
think
that
a
state
can
not
use
the
very
devices
that
congress
rejected
as
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
investors,
because
then
the
state
defeats
precisely
what
it
was
that
congress
had
in
mind
to
achieve.
idaho
simply
is
not
free
to
strike
a
different
balance
on
how
best
to
achieve
that.
congress
recognized
however
that
what
it
said
in
the
williams
act
was
not
the
last
word.
and
it
gave
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
a
substantial
rule-making
power.
in
fact,
almost
every
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
williams
act
is
coupled
with
the
grant
of
rule-making
power
that
the
commission
to
alter
it
to
change
it
in
some
way.
in
entrusting
that
rule-making
task,
the
fine
tuning
task,
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
congress
set
up
a
system
of
regulation
that
is
very
closely
related
in
concept
to
the
system
this
court
considered
last
year
in
ray
against
arco,
the
washington
super
tanker
case.
in
ray,
the
secretary
of
transportation
had
decided
not
to
set
up
a
rule
under
which
super
tanker
is
--
were
forbidden
to
enter
puget
sound,
and
had
decided
not
to
use
his
rule-making
powers,
although
he
surely
had
them,
to
set
up
a
rule
requiring
double
bottoms,
twin
screws
and
the
like.
washington
then
required
those
things
and
gave
as
a
rationale
the
argument
that
it
was
simply
increasing
protection
of
the
environment,
the
very
thing
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
its
statute.
and
it
wanted
to
view
that
congressional
statute
and
the
secretary's
regulations
as
minimum
guarantees
of
environmental
safety
with
the
state
adding
additional
guarantees
of
environmental
safety.
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
the
reason
it
rejected
it
is
because
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
the
same
power
to
assess
and
weigh
the
benefits
of
safety
against
the
convenience
of
commerce.
and
it
said
that
the
state
could
not
add
where
the
secretary
had
said
there
should
not
be
additional
protections.
and
that's
really
the
same
set
up
as
works
under
the
williams
act,
the
commission
is
free
to
provide
additional
period
to
increase
the
length
during
which
a
tender
offer
may
be
open.
it's
free
to
promulgate
a
great
number
of
other
regulations
that
will
have
the
effect
of
assessing
the
benefit
to
investor
against
whatever
detriment
to
commerce
may
be
caused.
and
it's
because
the
commission
has
that
authority
and
because
it
has
decided
to
exercise
it
in
a
way
that
does
not
provide
the
kinds
of
things
that
idaho
has
provided,
the
idaho
statute
is
preempted,
we
submit.
and
therefore,
under
both
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
commerce
clause,
if
the
court
reaches
the
merits
here,
we
submit
that
it
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
commission's
position
is
that
even
if
it
were
limited
to
intrastate
activities,
it
would
be
preempted
by
the
williams
act.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice,
i
don't
know
whether
they
took
it
before
this
case,
but
that
is
the
commission's
position,
but
commerce
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is,
your
honor.
the
--
that
should
be
distinguished
though
i
think
from
the
commission's
position
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
position
under
the
commerce
cause
allows
states
substantial
authority
to
regulate
within
the
state
for
the
same
reason
that
in
hall
against
geiger-jones,
the
commerce
clause
permitted
blue
sky
laws.
on
top
of
that,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
commission
does
not
argue
that
all
state
laws
touching
on
takeovers
are
preempted.
for
example,
a
state
law
requiring
any
statements
by
offeror
or
management
to
be
fair,
adequate
and
so
on,
similar
to
or
tracking
federal
law
could
be
enforced
and
on
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
--
no,
i
think
the
commission
is
not
of
that
view.
it's
any
state
law
that
makes
additions
of
the
sort
that
disrupt
the
balance
of
investor
protection
established
in
the
williams
act
and
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
but
it's
--
but
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out,
and
i'm
--
i
think
it
should
be
clear
that
in
the
commission's
view
there
are
a
number
of
possible
state
statutes
that
would
not
disrupt
the
balance.
take
for
example
a
state
statute
that
says
any
corporation
incorporated
in
this
state
shall
respond
to
tender
offers
only
by
two-thirds
vote
of
the
board
of
directors,
or
any
of
the
other
things
regulating
that
the
affairs
between
the
corporation
and
its
shareholders
would
in
most
cases
not
be
preempted
by
the
williams
act.
that
the
test
is
not
simply
does
it
touch
tender
offers.
we're
not
making
a
field
preemption
argument.
the
test
is
whether
it
upsets
or
undermines
the
careful
balancing
that
congress
has
done
of
the
--
and
its
assessment
of
where
the
interest
of
investors
lie.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
that
would
substantially
reduce
the
opportunities
for
disrupting
the
balance
that's
been
created
by
congress.
the
difficulties
in
allowing
a
state
to
regulate
even
those
offers
that
are
made
with
some
citizens
might
arise
if
for
example
new
york,
where
35%
of
shareholders
lie,
has
a
statute
saying
you
must
do
a.
california
where
there're
another
30%
has
a
statute
saying
you
can't
do
a,
and
each
tries
to
tug
the
balance
in
a
slightly
different
way.
the
opportunities
for
that
