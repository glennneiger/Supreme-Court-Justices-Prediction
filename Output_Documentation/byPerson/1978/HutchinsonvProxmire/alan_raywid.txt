mr.
alan
raywid
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
proper
assessment
of
this
case,
we
maintain,
requires
some
examination
of
the
facts
of
how
congress
actually
operates.
i'd
like
to
review
a
few
pertinent
facts.
in
the
year
of
the
filing
of
this
suit,
president
ford
had
submitted
a
budget
to
the
congress
of
just
short
of
$400
billion.
in
that
budget
was
some
$25
billion
allocated
for
research
and
development.
that
year
proved
to
be
an
all
time
high
of
$76
billion
in
deficit.
the
competitors
for
research
and
development
funds
included
such
national
interest
topics
as
energy
research,
national
defense,
environment
and
health.
it
is
an
annual
ritual
when
this
budget
is
submitted
to
the
congress
that
a
review
take
place
which
spends
most
of
the
legislative
year.
that
review
process
is
the
responsibility
first
to
the
appropriations
committee
and
many
of
its
subcommittees.
it
conducts
hearings
along
with
formal
review
process
and
a
report
to
the
congress
and
legislation
submitted
to
the
congress
is
an
informal
review
process
that
goes
on
continually
throughout
that
year.
that
is,
the
budget
officers
in
each
of
these
various
agencies
contact
the
appropriations
staff
and
they
exchange
information
and
they
are
asked
to
give
more
support
for
particular
items,
to
eliminate
some
items
and
to
get
the
budget
into
what
the
congress
deems
to
be
a
proper
shape.
in
that
same
process
is
going
on
in
the
house
on
parallel
committees
similarly
structured.
mr.
alan
raywid
principally,
the
speech
and
debate
issue.
it
also
touches
upon
first
amendment
but
principally
speech
or
debate,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
alan
raywid
well
--
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
correct.
when
a
speech
or
debate
immunity
is
raised
by
a
senator,
and
it
was
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
senator
and
his
aide,
it
requires
a
preliminary
investigation
or
a
preliminary
determination
by
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
it
appropriately
applies,
whether
legitimate
legislative
activity
is
involved.
once
that
has
been
raised
and
there
is
--
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
correct.
court
should
proceed
no
further
when
it
makes
such
a
determination
and
--
mr.
alan
raywid
should
not
reach
the
local
law,
should
not
reach
first
amendment.
it
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
first
reach
that
examination.
mr.
alan
raywid
that
would
be
the
appropriate
order,
but
in
order
to
reach
local
law,
it
might
first
have
to
determine
first
amendment
issues.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
if
certainly
if
there
is
no
libel
then
it
need
not
address
first
amendment.
mr.
alan
raywid
there
would
be
nothing
in
that
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
would
be
a
simple
determination
and
--
mr.
alan
raywid
it
would
need
no
evidentiary
showing
whatsoever.
a
demurrer
type
operation
would
be
sufficient.
it
wouldn't
merely
need
to
plea
the
speech
or
debate
clause
on
the
affirmance
on
the
complaint.
mr.
alan
raywid
perhaps
it
might,
but
i
would
think
that
the
senator
would've
observed
legal
procedure
like
any
other
litigant
and
raise
that
issue
preliminarily.
but
he
might
choose
not
to
answer
at
all,
and
it
would
then
be
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
examine
that
complaint
and
see
whether
or
not
it
was
immune.
i
have
been
describing
an
annual
ritual
of
some
rather
major
proportions
in
the
congress.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
that
is
the
principal
business
of
the
congress
and
takes
up
most
of
its
legislative
year.
now
turning
to
senator
proxmire,
senator
proxmire
is
a
member
of
the
senate
appropriations
committee
and
he
serves
on
five
of
its
subcommittees.
those
five
subcommittees
have
control
or
at
least
passed
upon
60%
of
the
national
budget.
they
passed
on
75%
on
--
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
correct,
that
any
member
has
this
right
but
it
certainly
more
particularized
in
his
responsibilities.
and
if
there
is
to
be
any
examination
made
of
his
conduct
--
mr.
alan
raywid
the
committee
membership
was
one
of
the
findings
below.
it
certainly
explains
if
any
examination
is
to
be
made
of
senator
proxmire.
but
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
stevens
that
any
--
that
right
rest
in
all
congressmen
and
it
is
one
that
the
congress
protects.
in
addition
to
these
committee
assignments
though
i
would
like
to
mention
one
additional
assignment
he
has.
all
of
these
subcommittee
assignments
span
his
or
span
the
particular
agencies
which
receive
the
fleece.
but
in
addition
to
that,
he
has
an
assignment
on
the
joint
economics
committee
and
he
is
chairman
of
its
priorities
and
economy
in
government.
that
committee
curiously
may
not
propose
any
legislation.
it
has
purely
an
informational
function.
it
publishes
a
number
of
reports,
but
its
most
popular
one
is
its
monthly
economic
indicators.
it
is
widely
circulated,
and
as
i
say,
has
an
informative
function
only.
senator
proxmire
has
been
in
the
senate
for
21
years.
it
has
been
hallmark
of
his
representation
that
he
has
always
criticized
waste
and
government
efficiency.
after
16
years
in
congress,
he
made
the
decision
that
he
could
be
much
more
affective
in
that
criticism
if
he
narrowed
his
focus
and
made
some
particular
or
dramatic
representation
of
waste
in
government.
billions
have
no
relation
or
have
no
sense
to
the
public
as
a
whole
or
even
that
matter
to
economists.
but
some
particular
item
that
the
government
has
paid
twice
the
amount
of
its
retail
value
does
have
a
lot
of
meaning.
he
has
chosen
a
pattern
of
making
a
speech
and
also
issuing
a
simultaneous
press
release
for
the
widest
possible
coverage.
he
has
explained
in
his
deposition
the
reason
why
he
does
this
is
that
debate
and
speaking
on
the
floor
is
not
a
debating
process
in
the
modern
congress.
senators
do
not
attend
speech
and
debates.
they
do
not
read
the
congressional
record
or
they
are
not
apt
to
generally,
but
they
do
read
the
newspapers
about
what
has
occurred
in
congress.
and
they
do
listen
to
their
constituents
about
what
their
constituents
are
concerned
about
in
congress.
it
is
that
manner
and
in
that
manner
he
feels
that
he
can
be
most
effective
in
his
criticism
of
spending.
now,
these
have
been
characterized
as
defamatory
and
--
or
mischaracterized
i
believe
as
defamatory.
but
before
we
reach
that
issue,
i
would
like
to
show
how
each
of
these
--
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
correct,
if
he
is
properly
executing
the
legislative
function
which
has
been
authorized
by
the
congress.
mr.
alan
raywid
without
question.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
in
--
possibly
yes,
probably
not.
mr.
alan
raywid
probably
not
protected.
we
draw
a
distinction
in
this
case
and
i
think
you
mr.
chief
justice
put
your
finger
on
or
at
least
our
element
of
the
case,
our
major
emphasis
when
you
asked
mr.
cavanaugh
whether
he
would
concede
as
to
whether
a
publication
authorized
by
the
congress
would
be
protected.
he
said
in
his
view,
it
would
be.
it
is
our
position
that
this
particular
release
through
newsletter
and
through
and
through
press
release
is
a
matter
specifically
authorized
by
congress.
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
alan
raywid
a
procedure
has
been
established
in
1973
after
this
court's
opinions
in
its
1971
and
1972
session.
a
procedure
was
established
for
mailings.
that's
in
39
u.s.c.
3210.
the
first
thing
that
was
placed
in
that
statute
was
first
to
express
the
intent
of
congress.
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
inform
the
public
and
that
that
was
part
of
its
legislative
process?
then
it
said
congressmen
may
mail
certain
items.
mr.
alan
raywid
they
may
not
mail
political
items.
they
may
not
put
in
personal
information.
then
it
established
a
procedure
for
complaints
and
it
also
established
a
procedure
for
review.
as
petitioners
pointed
out,
they
don't
review
them
for
the
accuracy
of
the
statements
but
they
--
mr.
alan
raywid
it
was
approved
for
it
was
because
mass
mailed.
it
was
sent
to
the
senate
service
department
for
approval
as
to
whether
it
conforms
to
these
statutory
rules
that
were
enacted
in
1973.
in
that
manner,
we
maintain
that
this
has
been
conduct
that
has
been
authorized
by
congress
and
for
that
matter
it
is
protected.
now
it
would
-
mr.
alan
raywid
that
would
be
too
broad.
what
we
do
maintain
is
that
this
court
should
give
due
deference
to
congress
in
the
way
congress
operates,
in
the
way
congress
says
it
operates.
congress
understands
best
how
to
perform
its
functions.
the
court
is
willing
and
has
frequently
given
due
deference
to
legislative
schemes
that
the
congress
establishes.
when
the
congress
itself
defines
how
it
is
to
operate,
we
say
that
a
substantial
amount
of
deference
should
be
given
to
congress.
there
may
be
some
determination
initially
by
this
court
in
its
authority
to
review
all
acts
of
congress
even
its
own
functions
as
to
whether
--
mr.
alan
raywid
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
broad
but
congress
helps
to
define
that
and
congress
helps
to
--
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
certainly
this
court
must
pass
on
the
scope
of
speech
or
debate.
but
in
arguing
due
deference,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
should
give
wide
latitude
the
congress
in
its
explanations
of
its
functions.
as
i
said,
it
understands
what
its
obligations
are
at
best,
and
some
review
process
is
necessary.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
this
court
of
course
is
the
ultimate
authority
on
defining
legitimate
legislative
activity.
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
raywid
certainly
that's
viewing
it
in
its
harshest
light,
but
that
one
i
would
have
to
agree.
mr.
alan
raywid
that
--
well
not
entirely
since
the
court
--
mr.
alan
raywid
well
since
the
court
has
held
that
it
was
not
defamatory
material
that
--
mr.
alan
raywid
the
district
court.
mr.
alan
raywid
that's
the
--
mr.
alan
raywid
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
alan
raywid
that
i
would
have
to
agree.
and
that
is
--
that
is
the
issue
posed
when
speech
or
debate
has
been
an
issue
raised.
mr.
alan
raywid
we
would
make
a
distinction
between
what
has
been
authorized
by
congress.
what
is
in
the
means
and
how
congress
has
defined
its
particular
function?
mr.
alan
raywid
we
have
advocated
to
what
is
specifically
authorized
a
per
se
approach.
that
tv
appearance
was
not
authorized
by
congress.
in
that
instance,
an
ad
hoc
approach
might
be
necessary.
was
--
and
a
more
thorough
examination
of
the
material
of
that
television
broadcast.
was
the
congressman
or
was
the
senator
in
that
program
serving
legitimate
legislative
needs?
mr.
alan
raywid
well
i
--
mr.
alan
raywid
in
a
sense,
yes.
mr.
alan
raywid
if
there
are
disputes,
that
is
supposed
to
be
referred
to
the
rules
committee.
but
quite
frequently
the
senate
service
department
returns
mails
or
returns
newsletters
and
says
“that
does
not
conform
to
our
rules.”
now
with
--
mr.
alan
raywid
the
rules
are
contained
--
mr.
alan
raywid
no
the
senate
rules
in
--
mr.
alan
raywid
--
in
rule
25
and
rule
48.
mr.
alan
raywid
--
places
authority,
screening
authority
--
mr.
alan
raywid
the
screening
of
--
first
of
all
the
rules
can
be
--
mr.
alan
raywid
yes.
it
has
been
cited
in
our
briefs.
mr.
alan
raywid
well
we
have
a
portion
there
on
how
congress
actually
operates.
i
want
--
i
don't
want
any
misconception
about
this.
there
is
no
--
mr.
alan
raywid
well
i
--
mr.
alan
raywid
--
i
know
of
no
limitation
on
that.
mr.
alan
raywid
he
may
put
it
in
the
congressional
record
and
--
mr.
alan
raywid
he
needs
no
--
there
is
no
censorship
imposed
on
members.
but
i
--
before
we
leave
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
mean
to
represent
that
the
senate
service
department
does
the
censoring
to
screen
out
information.
it
does
--
mr.
alan
raywid
yes,
yes
there
--
mr.
alan
raywid
yes,
there
is
a
self-policing
policy.
first
there
is
this
screening
also
--
mr.
alan
raywid
by
the
senate
service
department.
mr.
alan
raywid
and
the
--
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
correct,
and
they
are
employed
by
the
rules
committee.
now
then
there
are
two
other
restraining
forces,
it
seems
to
me,
and
that
is
the
ethics
committee.
complaints
may
be
referred
to
the
ethics
committee
for
disciplinary
action.
the
statute
that
i
referred
to
in
1973
establishes
a
whole
procedure
for
due
process
and
screening
of
any
material
that
may
be
defamatory.
so
there
is
a
self-policing
process
and
of
course
the
major
process
with
a
legislator
is
supposed
to
be
--
the
major
restraining
force
is
supposed
to
be
the
ballot
box.
mr.
alan
raywid
yes,
he
could
have
done
that
as
could
any
citizen.
we've
urged
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
must
take
into
account
how
congress
actually
operates.
we've
mentioned
due
deference.
in
the
investigations
conducted
by
congress,
this
court
has
seen
to
show
the
greater
--
the
greatest
amount
of
deference
even
though
that
investigation
might
not
be
specifically
authorized
by
congress.
the
--
once
an
investigation
has
been
determined
that
it
is
a
matter
upon
which
legislation
may
be
had,
this
court
has
said
it
will
not
examine
any
further
the
conduct
and
that
it
is
immune.
we
would
say
that
the
same
principle
ought
to
apply
in
the
--
with
respect
to
the
informing
function.
mr.
alan
raywid
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
not
say
that
it
has
been
--
most
frequently
it's
exercised
by
committee
chairman.
but
there
has
no
been
restraint
on
investigation
by
a
particular
member.
in
the
gravel
case,
in
the
investigation
in
that
sense
there
was
to
be
no
investigation
or
the
court
ruled
there
would
be
no
further
investigation
as
to
the
motives
of
that
member
in
preparing
himself
for
the
committee
hearing.
now
also
a
distinctive
feature
in
gravel
from
this
case,
and
it
has
been
relied
upon
by
petitioner
is
that
conduct
that
is
secret
material
was
specifically
proscribed
by
congress,
both
its
collection
and
its
distribution.
the
distinction
we
believe
that
should
be
apparent
in
this
case
is
that
this
particular
material
has
been
generally
authorized
by
congress
and
the
newsletters
and
press
releases
had
been
specifically
facilitated.
mr.
alan
raywid
it
would
not
--
it
would
not
try
to
muscle
a
particular
member.
that
might
be
an
abuse
that
this
court
would
ask
to
be
resolved
in
the
member's
favor.
but
it
does
attempt
to
screen
for
facilitation
or
that
the
particular
proscription
in
the
1973
act
had
not
been
violated,
that
--
mr.
alan
raywid
it
may
frequently
and
has
in
the
past
concern
libel.
mr.
alan
raywid
then
i
expect
the
screening
process
might
have
stopped
its
distribution.
mr.
alan
raywid
i
said
it
screens
for
conformance
with
its
rules.
mr.
alan
raywid
so
long
as
it
serves
the
legitimate
legislative
need,
and
so
long
as
congress
has
made
that
determination,
it
seems
to
me
that
due
deference
should
be
paid
to
that
determination
and
immunity
would
follow.
and
the
wisconsin
law
would
have
to
give
way.
mr.
alan
raywid
it
sought
to
protect
their
communication
with
their
constituents
and
--
mr.
alan
raywid
in
the
extreme
situation
that
you
pose,
yes.
but
there
is
broad
definition
there
as
to
--
that
the
matters
should
relate
to
business
before
the
congress,
to
matters
of
broad
public
interest,
to
only
state
information
where
it
bears
upon
the
impact
of
national
legislation.
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
true.
however,
each
senator
of
course
has
national
impact
and
votes
on
national
issues.
the
actual
facts
there
are
that
--
and
what
proxmire
explained
was
that
he
mails
his
constituents.
he
also
avails
to
those
persons
who
have
requested
to
be
placed
on
his
mailing
list.
mr.
alan
raywid
those
--
that
determination
is
made
entirely
separately,
and
those
are
the
press
releases.
they
are
broadly
distributed
and
are
not
confined
to
his
state
by
any
means.
petitioner
has
properly
represented
that
they
went
to
news
media
throughout
the
country.
constituents
are
another
matter,
the
newsletters
are
another
matter
and
they
are
not
sent
as
a
matter
of
routine
to
the
press
and
the
media.
there
has
been
reliance
placed
on
story's
interpretation
of
the
constitution,
and
his
early
pronouncements
as
to
whether
or
not
speech
or
debate
would
cover
--
speech
or
debate
immunity
would
cover
republication.
on
the
very
issue
that
you've
raised
mr.
chief
justice,
story
has
an
extended
comment.
i
don't
know
whether
we
read
different
editions,
but
in
the
fifth
edition
in
section
866,
and
there's
an
extended
footnote
which
he
says
that
congress
may
have
an
immunity
when
they
write
to
their
constituents,
report
to
their
constituents
and
he
treats
the
very
issue
that
you
raised.
that
constituent
issue
should
not
be
confined
to
his
particular
state.
he
ought
to
be
able
to
reach
an
influence
legislation
beyond
that
state.
and
his
immunity
is
perhaps
so
far
as
he
accurately
reports
and
does
not
defame.
now
story
goes
on
in
the
quote
that
has
been
cited
in
the
reply
brief,
and
then
there's
a
caveat
at
the
end
of
his
long
examination
of
speech
and
debate
which
was
not
included
in
that
quote.
and
he
says
that
there
are
legal
scholars
that
agree
--
or
that
disagree
on
my
interpretation
of
the
english
law,
than
make
a
distinction
in
american
law
that
because
it
--
the
congress
has
mandated
that
all
of
its
speeches
and
all
of
its
proceedings,
unlike
the
english
law
or
parliament,
be
made
public
then
the
argument
follows
that
speech
or
debate
should
follow
a
republication
of
official
congressional
business.
whether
it
be
on
speaking
on
the
floor,
or
whether
it
be
on
publication
or
distribution
by
that
congressman
of
what
he
said
on
the
floor.
mr.
alan
raywid
i
miss
the
first
part,
if
you
said
gross?
mr.
alan
raywid
the
senate
can
discipline
its
member.
the
senate
can
--
mr.
alan
raywid
--
that's
all.
it
can
not
award
damages,
but
it
can
discipline
--
mr.
alan
raywid
well
i
would
say
--
mr.
alan
raywid
oh
yes.
there
has
been
established
in
the
ethics
committee
or
other
detailed
procedure
for
of
due
process.
mr.
alan
raywid
it
does
not
specifically
call
for
that,
no
it
does
not.
but
that
his
views
might
be
expressed
through
committee
council,
and
that
would
be
in
the
sense
of
--
mr.
alan
raywid
i
do
not
know.
in
the
early
history
of
the
congress
--
mr.
alan
raywid
--
the
disciplinary
practice
was
quite
common,
and
it
certainly
is
increasingly
so
not
as
to
the
particular
issue
raised
by
mr.
justice
white.
i
--
mr.
alan
raywid
i
do
not
know
that
how
frequently
it
is
been.
of
course
the
1973
act
is
rather
new.
mr.
alan
raywid
the
--
none.
mr.
alan
raywid
we
have
argued
that
it
was
somewhat
akin
to
judicial
immunity.
mr.
alan
raywid
the
senators
--
mr.
alan
raywid
well
i
disagree
with
you
and
the
district
court
supports
me.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
i
think
they
had
an
opportunity
and
i
think
they
were
called
by
committee
council,
and
a
careful
bill
of
particulars
was
prepared.
mr.
alan
raywid
excuse
me?
mr.
alan
raywid
well
it
certainly
was
not
an
open
trial,
but
it
was
due
process
and
it
was
--
mr.
alan
raywid
yes.
mr.
alan
raywid
well
i'm
quite
certain
they
sought
appearance.
mr.
alan
raywid
but
--
mr.
alan
raywid
at
the
sufferance
of
the
committee.
mr.
alan
raywid
certainly,
i
have
mentioned
it
extensively
in
the
brief.
mr.
alan
raywid
certainly,
i
mentioned
it
to
the
courts
below.
what
we
hadn't
pointed
--
mr.
alan
raywid
well
what
we
try
to
point
out
in
the
courts
below,
and
successfully
so,
that
that
issue
was
not
posed
to
the
brewster
court,
that
that
was
not
contained
in
the
brewster
case.
they
were
talking
about
bribery.
it
might've
been
helpful
in
explaining
the
scope
of
legislative
immunity
in
that
particular
case.
we're
not
maintaining
for
unlawful
conduct
here
that
any
specific
activity
proscribed
by
congress
itself
should
speech
or
debate
immunity
apply.
mr.
alan
raywid
any
--
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
principally
criminal
conduct
but
it
might.
mr.
alan
raywid
well
i'm
talking
about
a
proscription
imposed
by
congress
itself.
mr.
alan
raywid
yes.
but
also
in
the
doe
case
when
they
were
--
when
the
court
was
considering
whether
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
legitimate
legislative
need.
in
order
to
meet
the
brewster
language,
we
made
an
elaborate
evidentiary
showing
rather
than
the
mere
halting
of
immunity
by
simply
the
letter
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
might
be
filed.
we
made
an
extensive
evidentiary
showing
to
try
and
explain
how
congress
operates,
how
congress
conceives
this
--
its
own
function,
and
in
that
manner
hope
to
overcome
that
dicta
and
showed
that
this
was
necessary
to
a
legitimate
legislative
function.
mr.
alan
raywid
they
are.
mr.
alan
raywid
well
the
--
mr.
alan
raywid
the
--
mr.
alan
raywid
well
we
believe
that
a
majority
of
the
court
has.
the
dictum
--
the
--
excuse
me,
the
brewster
majority
turned
out
to
be
the
doe
minority.
and
they
were
talking
in
the
doe
minority
of
the
rights
of
congress
or
the
necessary
function
of
congress
to
inform.
we
think
that
seven
members
of
this
court
have
given
more
than
adequate
treatment
to
the
informing
function.
mr.
alan
raywid
yes
it
had.
the
would
--
mr.
alan
raywid
well
i
merely
wanted
to
say
that
yes,
and
to
that
extent
we
would
say
that
in
our
per
se
application
that
those
should
be
extended.
it
was
only
of
course
the
majority
opinion
there
was
written
by
only
two
justices
and
joined
by
an
additional
three.
but
i
think
the
critical
factor
in
doe
and
the
influential
factor
with
the
--
that
made
up
the
majority
is
that
this
was
exposure
for
the
sheer
sake
of
exposure
in
violation
of
watkins,
and
the
court
was
offended
by
that.
when
--
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
so
intimately
tied
to
public
spending
and
how
these
agencies
and
given
to
these
particular
agencies,
and
authorized
by
congress.
those
are
distinguishing
elements
but
to
the
extent
that
we
are
contrary
to
doe,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
modify
that.
mr.
alan
raywid
no,
but
as
mr.
justice
white
said,
or
i
believe
i'm
properly
paraphrasing
him
that
we
may
make
the
assumption
that
it
was
libelous.
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
was
necessary,
but
neither
does
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
in
--
want
to
get
into
the
examination
of
each
the
exercise
of
each
congressman,
how
he
feels
he
will
reach
the
public,
how
he
will
influence
legislation,
how
he
will
garner
votes.
if
it
is,
it
will
be
placing
the
legislature
under
the
heel
of
the
judiciary
and
it
will
remove
to
a
substantial
degree
the
representation
of
congress.
mr.
alan
raywid
well
that
issue
may
never
come
to
this
court,
it's
true.
but
i
would
put
no
less
weight
on
a
possible
hostile
judiciary
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
or
any
other
state
as
curbing
the
activity
of
a
congressman.
it's
equally
important
it
seems
to
remove
that
from
all
courts.
mr.
alan
raywid
not
for
unlawful
activity
or
activity
proscribed
by
congress.
but
where
it
is
authorized
--
mr.
alan
raywid
yes,
it
would
say
he's
immune,
it
sound
very
much
like
sedition
laws.
mr.
alan
raywid
a
criminal
to
prosecute
a
congressman
in
issuing
a
letter
in
the
manner
proscribed
by
congress
and
make
that
subject
to
a
criminal
libel
law,
yes.
it
seems
to
me
akin
to
a
sedition
law.
mr.
alan
raywid
yes,
and
this
--
and
i've
stated
in
every
one
of
these
instances
or
the
conduct
under
review
here
is
conduct
of
criticism
of
the
government.
mr.
alan
raywid
we
should
bring
an
action
against
that
congressman,
and
he
should
be
prosecuted
in
those
local
courts
without
question.
mr.
alan
raywid
it
certainly
would
not.
mr.
alan
raywid
no,
that's
not
sedition,
the
same
if
he
ran
over
someone.
mr.
alan
raywid
i
don't
believe,
or
certainly
not
my
reading
mr.
justice
stewart
of
all
of
those
treatises
as
narrowed
it
to
congress.
it's
seems
to
the
major
--
mr.
alan
raywid
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
best
articulated
our
position
on
the
informing
function
in
his
dissent
in
doe.
he
characterizes
that
informing
function
in
four
different
stages.
he
talks
about
the
public,
getting
word
back
from
the
public,
and
the
participation
of
the
public
and
with
their
congressman
and
how
that
influences
legislation.
i
would
say
it
was
far
beyond
--
mr.
alan
raywid
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion,
but
as
i've
tried
to
point
out
it
seems
to
me
that
a
number
of
dissenters
in
the
varying
opinions
of
the
court
had
been
very
much
conscious
of
the
informing
function
then
they
would
make
up
or
which
i
invite
a
new
majority
in
recognizing
the
informing
function
as
--
mr.
alan
raywid
most
definitely.
mr.
alan
raywid
oh
certainly.
other
members
play
a
definite
part,
and
that
was
what
senator
proxmire
said
was
important
to
--
mr.
alan
raywid
in
the
tier,
in
the
hierarchy
and
structure
of
the
senate,
the
member's
rights
have
been
protected
and
encouraged.
mr.
alan
raywid
by
the
senate
rules.
no
one
attempts
to
muscle
an
individual
senator.
and
in
the
investigative
phase,
it's
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
mcsurely
case.
a
summary
information
must
start
with
a
particular
senator.
he
receives
some
information,
he
asks
an
executive
official
and
that
starts
the
process.
it
can
not
all
be
formalized
through
subpoena,
to
the
--
by
a
committee
or
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
otherwise
nothing
really
would
get
started
except
the
most
popular
items.
