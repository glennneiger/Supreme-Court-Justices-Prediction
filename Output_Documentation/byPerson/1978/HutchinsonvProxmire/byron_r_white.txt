justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
district
court
make
that
same
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
part
of
the
district
court
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
talking
about
the
first
amendment
part
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
as
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
district
court
also
reached
the
state
law
question
of
whether
these
remarks
were
defamatory?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
ruled
that
they
were
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
this
is
a
state
law
issue,
i
take
it,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
isn't
it,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
told
that
--
said
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
it
was
going
to
be
local
law
that
would
govern
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
if
these
remarks
were
not
defamatory,
what
excuse
is
there
for
ever
reaching
the
first
amendment
issue
at
least?
i'm
not
talking
about
speech
or
debate.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what
--
isn't
it
the
usual
rule,
you
reach
non-constitutional
issues
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
the
district
court
on
the
ground
these
remarks
were
not
defamatory.
would
there
be
any
constitutional
issues
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cavanaugh,
why
should
we
reach
the
either
the
first
amendment
issue
where
the
speech
or
debate
clause
if
the
district
court
is
right
that
this
wasn't
defamatory
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
so
but
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
said
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
rarely
disagree
with
lower
courts
on
what
state
law
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
we
rule
on
then,
on
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
we
granted
certiorari
that
may
be
is
a
good
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
there
are
required
decisions
in
the
state
courts
the
other
way,
aren't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
raywid,
could
you
comment
just
briefly
on
why
we
should
reach
that
issue
here
if
the
court
of
appeals
could've
disposed
of
the
case
on
a
state
law
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
deal
with
the
state
law
ground
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
do
you
say
for
a
speech
or
debate
is
involved
it
is
the
threshold
issue
because
the
senator
shouldn't
even
be
in
court
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
shouldn't
reach
the
local
issue
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
in
general,
that's
in
general
i
take
it
because
congressmen
and
senators
are
authorized
to
frank
their
communications
to
their
constituents.
is
that
what
you
mean?
i
mean
this
particular
release
wasn't
approved
by
congress.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
by
any
committee
for
that
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i'm
asking
was
this
particular
publication
approved
as
it
was
written
by
a
committee?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
submission
is
i
take
it
that
the
senator
may
in
his
newsletter
to
his
constituents
tell
knowing
or
--
and
deliberate
falsehoods
about
other
people
and
be
immune.
that
even
if
this
is
the
closes
kind
of
defamation
under
wisconsin
or
local
law
that
the
senator
is
immune
from
distributing
these
statements
in
his
newsletter,
that's
you
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
the
basis
on
which
we
must
review
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
held
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
think
we
must
on
the
speech
or
debate
issue,
you
certainly
can
object
to
our
viewing
the
case
on
the
basis
that
this
is
the
grossest
kind
of
defamation?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
i
agree
with
you,
i
agree
with
you.
and
would
you
say
the
senator's
immune
on
the
--
at
the
rostrum
in
his
home
district
if
he
gets
out
his
newsletter
and
reads
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
do
you
say
about
he
radio
and
television
broadcast?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
raywid
what
if
senator
gravel's
newsletter
had
contained
the
so-called
the
secret
information
you
referred
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
said
it
doesn't
censor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
something
in
the
newsletter
would
violate
wisconsin
law
or
local
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
congress
did
intend
to
authorize
senators
to
in
their
newsletter,
give
them
immunity,
absolute
immunity
for
the
grossest
kind
of
defamation
that
you
think
that
was
their
intention
in
this
legislation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
or
no,
i
would
suppose
my
question
can
be
answered
with
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
can't
even
vindicate
the
person's
reputation,
can
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
wouldn't
be
a
trial
or
a
hearing
or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
participation
by
the
victim
of
a
libel,
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
they
were
invited.
they
had
no
right
to
appear
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
were
there
at
the
sufferance
of
the
committee.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
for
openly
illegal
activities?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
a
criminal
libel
law
in
the
state,
and
this
publication
--
anybody
would,
in
his
right
mind
would
take
this
criminal
libel,
you
say
he's
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
libel,
the
more
libel
sounds
like
sedition?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
sedition.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
can
tell
him
who
to
vote
for,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
newspaper
publishing
a
quote
from
the
congressional
record
liable
to
a
--
to
the
victim?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
your
honor.
generally
there
is
a
privilege
for
the
media
to
report
the
--
so
if
the
media
takes
the
congressional
record
in
which
this
golden
fleece
award
has
been
placed
and
publishes
it
in
full,
it
is
--
it's
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
senator
though
if
he
mails
it
out
in
his
newsletter,
the
very
same
thing,
a
copy
of
the
congressional
record,
you
say
he
is
not
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
submission
is
though
that
newsletters
are
an
ordinary
way
of
legislating.
