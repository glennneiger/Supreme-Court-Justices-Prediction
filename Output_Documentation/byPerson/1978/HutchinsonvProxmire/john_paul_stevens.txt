justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cavanaugh,
what
would
you
say
if
they
just
mailed
out
--
that
you
just
mailed
out
the
congressional
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
same
mailing
list
you
got
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cavanaugh,
shouldn't
--
if
he's
going
to
ask
for,
what
do
you
get
$900,000.00
or
something
like
that
according
to
the
footnote
in
judge
layton's
opinion,
shouldn't
he
be
prepared
to
defend
in
a
public
forum
the
appropriateness
of
that
kind
of
spending
by
the
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
may
have
been
entirely
proper,
i
don't
suggest
that.
but
when
you
do
get
involved
in
seeking
public
funds
of
that
magnitude,
isn't
it
appropriate
to
consider
that
you
must
be
prepared
to
defend
publicly
the
expenditure
of
that
kind
of
money?
does
that
seem
reasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
he
know
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
typically
a
subject
of
public
debate
and
newspaper
articles
where
there
might
be
careless
comment
on
the
way
it
goes
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
when
you
get
into
the
appropriations
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
that
is
more
of
a
public
issue
than
the
public
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
raywid
as
i
understood
your
brief,
you'd
make
precisely
the
same
argument
if
senator
proxmire
was
not
a
member
of
any
of
these
committees,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
presumably
every
senator
has
an
interest
in
avoiding
waste
of
government
funds,
so
i
don't
understand
what
the
committee
membership
has
to
do
with
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
mr.
raywid
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
correct,
is
it
mr.
raywid
that
in
the
disciplinary
proceedings
for
example
of
senator
mccarthy
that
the
victims
of
his
comments
did
have
an
opportunity
in
some
cases
to
testify
and
a
certain
extent
vindicate
their
reputation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
it
was
an
adequate
opportunity
is
another
issue
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
it
was
an
adequate
opportunity
is
another
issue
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
any
event,
that's
the
remedy
that
you
say
is
available
on
this
sort
of
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cavanaugh,
in
your
principle
argument
i
asked
you
about
the
public
figure
issue
and
you
helped
me
out
there.
what
about
the
public
official
problem
which
the
court
below
did
not
reach?
wasn't
your
client
a
public
official
as
that
term
has
been
used
in
the
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
measure
--
did
you
measure
it
by
the
number
of
persons
under
his
supervision?
is
that
the
test?
or
was
it
the
importance
of
his
responsibilities?
