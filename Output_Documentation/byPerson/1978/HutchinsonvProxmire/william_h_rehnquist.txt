mr.
cavanaugh,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
is
diversity
of
citizenship.
i
take
it
then
that
it's
state
law
of
some
state
that
forms
the
substantive
basis
for
your
claim
of
libel
and
slander?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
state,
wisconsin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
be
a
question
of
wisconsin
choice
of
law
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
talk
about
findings
and
so
on,
this
case
went
off
on
summary
judgment
against
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
finding
of
fact
on
a
disputed
issue
where
the
court
of
appeals
affirms
on
a
clearly
erroneous
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
you
contend
that
the
court
--
you're
entitled
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
pass
on
the
question
of
state
law
just
the
way
you
would
in
any
other
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
even
though
the
constitutional
question
shouldn't
be
reached.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
almost
like
going
back
to
the
plurality
opinion
in
metromedia
versus
rosenbloom,
isn't
it?
if
you
say
something
bad
about
a
person
and
it's
published,
that
makes
him
a
public
figure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
under
your
hypothesis,
say
the
district
court
here
in
madison
would've
addressed
first
speech
and
debate
then
local
law
then
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
matter
is
entirely
in
the
hands
of
congress
that
congress
could've
passed
a
statute
saying
that
anything
that
a
congressman
or
a
senator
wants
to
mail
anywhere
at
anytime
is
protected
regardless
of
how
defamatory
it
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
when
you're
talking
about
deference
basically,
this
is
a
case
that
could've
been
in,
for
all
practical
purposes
for
the
issues
here
been
brought
in
the
state
court
in
wisconsin.
and
so
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
enforcing
its
libel
policy
or
its
slander
policy
is
foreclosed
from
enforcing
it
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
it
isn't
a
question
of
this
court
giving
due
deference
to
the
senate
or
the
house.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
never
been
reviewed
by
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
hasn't
that
generally
applied
to
committee
chairman
or
committee
activities
rather
than
individual
members
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
doe,
the
committee
it
authorized
the
publication,
had
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
of
the
judiciary,
i
mean
basically
it's
a
question
of
wisconsin
tort
law
unless
the
constitution
prohibits
it.
it
isn't
certainly
up
to
this
court
to
kind
of
pull
something
out
of
the
sky
and
say
“yes,
you
can”
or
“no,
you
can.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
sedition
it
thought
was
criticism
of
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
supposing
a
senator
goes
back
to
his
home
state
and
says
“the
guy
who
lives
next
to
me
in
madison
is
a
real
sob.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
doctrine
would
not
extend
that
far?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
michigan
they
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
congress
could
forbid
any
federal
court
from
taking
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
such
as
this
against
a
member
of
congress,
could
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
they're
not
rewriting
the
constitution.
they're
simply
saying
that
courts
that
which
they
create.
lower
federal
courts
shall
not
entertain
particular
types
of
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
congress
could
repeal
diversity
jurisdiction
tomorrow.
