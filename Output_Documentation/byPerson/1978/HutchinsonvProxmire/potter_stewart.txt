justice
potter
stewart
on
that
broadcast,
am
i
correct
in
remembering
that
dr.
hutchinson's
name
was
not
mentioned?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
yes.
your
answer's
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
there
some
question
about
whether
or
not
there
was
more
than
one
broadcast?
i
know
you
say
there
were
at
least
two
but.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
paul
against
davis
is
a
1983
case.
this
is
a
case
based
upon
state
tort
law,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
were
those
press
releases
or
newsletters?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
not.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now
before
you
get
into
this
public
figure
business
or
public
official,
those
concepts
have
been
deemed
important
in
the
decisions
and
opinions
of
this
court
when
the
alleged
false
defamatory
material
has
been
published
by
some
instrumentality
of
the
public
news
media.
isn't
that
correct?
is
there
any
case
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
there
any
case
here
that
holds
that
the
so-called
new
york
times
rules
are
applicable
when
the
defamatory
statement
has
been
made
by
an
individual
person,
human
being?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
may
be
that
whether
or
not
your
client
is
a
public
figure
is
totally
irrelevant?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
brief
or
argue
this
basic
question?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
although
you've
assumed
it,
you
reserve
the
privilege
of
arguing
that
it
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
not
arguing
it
here.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
very
fact
of
his
defamation?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
media
always
could.
justice
potter
stewart
he
certainly
could
in
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
up
to
us
in
this
case
to
decide
the
question
that
my
brother
rehnquist
accurately,
i
think,
says
is
posed
by
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
can
the
state
of
wisconsin
enforce
its
policy
expressed
in
its
tort
law
in
this
diversity
case,
in
defamation
slander
cases
in
these
circumstances
despite
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
and
that's
a
decision
that
--
that's
a
question
that
this
court
has
to
answer
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
the
end
of
the
case
then
if
we
accept
that.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
raywid,
you
haven't
there,
if
you
have
i
missed
it,
mentioned
the
language
the
in
the
court
opinion
on
the
brewster
case
that
explicitly
and
unambiguously
held
said,
said
that
newsletters
and
press
releases
are
simply
not
covered
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
have
you
mentioned
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
at
this
point.
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
wouldn't
be
up
to
you,
i
suppose,
to
emphasize
it
and
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
criminal
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
said
unlawful
conduct,
you
meant
criminal
conduct
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
allegation
is
that
the
senator's
conduct
was
unlawful
as
a
matter
of
civil
law.
justice
potter
stewart
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statements
in
the
court's
opinion
in
the
brewster
case
are
clear
and
unambiguous
aren't
they?
they
are,
as
you
suggest,
perhaps
dicta.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
court
would
certainly
have
to
modify
or
remand
those
views,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
--
to
accept
your
submission.
justice
potter
stewart
this
informal
function
of,
excuse
me,
excuse
me
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
you
can
complete
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
raywid
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
you
rely
--
i'd
like
to
ask
the
question
i've
perhaps
been
too
deferential.
justice
potter
stewart
you
rely
a
great
deal
on
your
brief
on
what
you
call
the
informing
function
of
congress
to
justify
bringing
the
newsletters
and
press
release
within
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
that
function
which
was
emphasized
by
woodrow
wilson
has
been
by
many,
many
others.
i'd
always
understood
to
be
largely
the
function
of
congress
to
inform
itself
in
order
to
intelligently
legislate.
you
rather
understand
it
as
a
function
of
informing
the
public.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
the
justification
for
congressional
investigations
by
its
various
committees
and
subcommittees.
the
basic
justification
is
the
informing
of
the
members
of
congress
so
that
they
can
be
--
act
intelligently
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
vote
for
against
a
proposed
legislation
or
even
in
framing
the
proposed
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
all
respect
to
my
brother
blackmun,
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
informing
of
the
public,
not
the
informing
of
the
members
of
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
both
at
least
if
you
would
concede
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
simply
under
article
iii
that
congress
has
the
power
to
create
any
inferior
federal
courts
that
it
wants
to
and
to
allocate
to
them
any
jurisdiction
that
it
wants
to.
that's
all
that
my
brother
rehnquist
is
talking
about,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
