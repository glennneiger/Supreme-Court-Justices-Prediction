chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
mr.
justice
white.
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
hutchinson
against
proxmire
and
others.
mr.
cavanaugh,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
get
on
to
that.
is
there
in
your
position
the
notion
that
whether
or
not
he
is
a
public
figure,
is
a
jury
issue
which
can
not
be
resolved
by
the
court
on
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
you
must
mean
that
among
other
things
that
that's
an
issue
which
cannot
be
resolved,
that's
a
factual
issue
which
can
not
be
resolved
on
affidavits
but
only
by
a
trial
of
the
issues,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
say
there
were
100,000
of
these
press
releases
sent
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
--
all
in
wisconsin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
what
the
spread
was
under
wisconsin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
congress
for
some
reason
or
other
sent
the
same
copy
of
the
congressional
record
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
committee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
cavanaugh.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
raywid.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
is
this
--
these
observations
directed
at
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
the
first
amendment
issue
or
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
suppose
a
complaint
in
its
terms
alleged
only
that
the
defamatory
statements
were
made
in
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house
or
the
senate
on
a
given
day
and
then
give
the
content
of
that
speech.
would
there
be
anything
in
that
case
except
speech
or
debate
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
demurrer
type
of
response
to
it
by
the
senator?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
approach
on
that
hypothetical,
the
senator
or
congressman
might
write
a
letter
rather
than
filing
a
formal
answer
saying
“on
the
face
of
the
complaint
against
me,
i
am
not
required
to
answer
in
any
place
other
than
the
senate
or
the
house
itself.”
and
that
would
suffice
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
made
a
commencement
speech
at
the
university
of
michigan
where
dr.
hutchinson
was
employed
and
said
all
the
same
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
probably
not
protected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
understand
you
to
suggest
that
congress
by
a
legislative
enactment
can
broaden,
expand
the
scope
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
defines
it
finally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
you've
already
said
that
no
one
checks
the
content
then
how
do
you
authorize
the
contents
of
a
letter
which
the
congress
has
carefully,
very
carefully
said
they
would
not
censor,
was
the
term
you
used.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
only
suggesting
that
congress
could
by
a
legislative
enactment
authorize
a
libel,
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white
put
it
to
you
in
different
terms,
extend
the
statute
of
the
speech
or
debate
immunity
to
something
which
it
does
not
cover
within
the
reach
of
that
clause.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
letters,
the
newsletters
that
went
outside
of
wisconsin?
senators
don't
have
constituents
in
the
technical
sense
outside
of
their
own
states,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
might
include
quite
a
few
newspapers
for
example
and
radio
and
television
broadcasters.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
members
have
been
subject
to
that
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
speaking
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
the
last
one
--
was
the
last
one
about
20
years
ago,
the
most
recent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
in
order
to
explain
unwise
public
expenditures,
it's
necessary
to
libel
someone
in
order
to
get
attention?
is
that
the
justification
for
the
libel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
i
think
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
read
woodrow
wilson's
essays
as
putting
the
emphasis
on
informing
and
educating
the
public.
but
that
was
a
function
of
the
congress
through
its
committees
not
100
individual
senators
and
435
individual
congressmen
running
off
on
their
own
and
having
any
immunity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
detained
you
long
enough
now
counsel.
we'll
see
if
mr.
cavanaugh
has
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
don't
allow
in
michigan
citizens
to
vote
in
other
states,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
the
real
damage
that
you're
talking
about
is
in
the
academic
community
and
his
professional
reputation
as
a
scientist
who
either
within
the
country
or
out
of
the
country
if
he
has
a
wide
enough
reputation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
the
senator
or
a
congressman,
however,
who
is
focusing
on
some
particular
problem,
how
do
you
say
he
should
inform
his
constituents
or
the
broad
constituency
which
is
the
country?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
issued
a
press
release,
even
a
great
many
of
them,
simply
stating
all
these
facts
that
“x”
hundred
thousands
of
dollars
were
being
done
and
reciting
factually
and
accurately
the
nature
of
the
research,
how
many
members
of
the
media
would
pay
any
attention
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
pretty
dull
stuff,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
clause,
if
it's
within
the
clause,
the
clause
says
he
may
not
be
questioned.
that
literally
means
they
can't
even
ask
him
a
question
on
a
deposition,
on
the
witness
stand
in
the
courtroom
or
anywhere
else.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
surely
would
have
no
jurisdiction
under
article
iii,
any
power
under
article
iii
to
define
state
court
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
when
a
federal
court
sits
on
a
state
case
diversity,
it's
a
surrogate
for
a
state
court,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
--
congress
has
been
urged
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
