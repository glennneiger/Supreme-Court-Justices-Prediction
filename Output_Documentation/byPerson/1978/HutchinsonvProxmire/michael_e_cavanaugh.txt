mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
michael
cavanaugh
of
lansing,
michigan
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
--
excuse
me,
the
petitioner,
dr.
ronald
hutchinson.
this
is
a
civil
action
by
dr.
hutchinson,
a
research
scientist
against
the
united
states
senator
william
proxmire
and
his
aide
morton
schwartz,
seeking
damages
for
libel,
slander,
interference
with
contractual
relations
and
invasion
of
privacy,
and
intentional
infliction
of
mental
anguish.
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
is
diversity
of
citizenship.
in
march
of
1975,
senator
proxmire
launched
a
series
of
monthly
press
releases
which
were
designed
according
to
senator
proxmire
to
focus
national
attention
upon
what
he
considered
as
the
greatest
waste
of
taxpayer
money
that
could
be
located
that
month.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
your
honor,
ultimately
state
law
will
be
applied.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
there
are
three
possible
choices,
wisconsin,
the
district
of
columbia,
and
the
state
of
michigan.
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
state
law
to
be
applied
would
be
the
state
of
michigan.
the
petitioner
resides
in
the
state
of
michigan.
the
publication
was
nationwide
but
the
greatest
impact
would
be
in
the
state
of
michigan,
and
we
think
that
under
the
wisconsin
choice
of
law
provisions
they
would
look
to
the
impact
of
the
tort
and
that
michigan
law
would
be
applied.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
our
contention
your
honors
that
a
review
of
the
press
releases
issued
by
senator
proxmire
that
are
contained
in
this
record
along
with
the
evidence
that
relates
to
them
will
show
that
the
press
releases
typically
will
take
a
small
part
of
a
research
project,
distort
it
and
then
indicate
that
the
full
amount
of
the
research
grant
was
granted
for
that
project.
the
press
releases
are
typically
filled
with
sarcasm
and
humiliate
the
researcher
involved.
in
april
of
1975,
dr.
hutchinson
was
selected
for
the
“golden
fleece
of
the
month
award.”
the
golden
fleece
issued
for
dr.
hutchinson
contained
defamatory
and
untrue
statements.
the
following
statements
among
others
were
made.
the
government
paid
one
half
million
dollars
to
find
out
that
anger,
stopping
smoking
and
loud
noises
produce
jaw
clenching.
all
this
money
was
given
to
dr.
hutchinson
of
kalamazoo
state
hospital.
in
fact,
the
good
doctor
has
made
a
fortune
from
his
monkeys
and
in
the
process
made
a
monkey
of
the
american
taxpayer.
the
press
release
also
stated
that
dr.
hutchinson's
research
work
was
perhaps
duplicative.
in
the
course
of
the
depositions,
the
respondents
have
admitted
that
prior
to
issuance
of
the
press
release
they
knew
that
the
$500,000.00
did
not
go
to
dr.
hutchinson
personally,
but
rather
was
paid
to
the
state
of
michigan
and
used
by
the
state
of
michigan
to
pay
salaries,
to
pay
for
supplies,
overhead
and
similar
expenses.
as
far
as
the
statement
that
in
fact
the
good
doctor
has
made
a
fortune
from
his
monkeys,
the
respondents
contended
in
deposition
that
this
was
merely
a
reflection
of
dr.
hutchinson's
status
and
power
as
a
researcher,
and
a
reflection
of
his
income
which
they
claim
is
among
the
highest
percentages
of
income
in
the
united
states.
in
fact,
at
the
time
the
fleece
was
issued,
dr.
hutchinson's
salary
from
the
state
was
$30,000.00
which
was
the
highest
at
any
time
covered
by
the
fleece.
the
period
of
time
he
served
as
a
college
professor,
the
salary
would've
been
considerably
less.
in
depositions,
the
respondents
had
also
admitted
that
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
press
release
they
received
statements
from
the
funding
agencies
that
gave
the
true
nature
of
dr.
hutchinson's
work.
the
office
of
naval
research
and
the
national
aeronautics
and
space
administration,
particularly
gave
statements
to
the
respondents
which
indicated
that
dr.
hutchinson
had
for
the
first
time,
given
those
agencies,
an
accurate
method
of
detecting
and
measuring
aggression.
the
navy
hoped
to
use
that
research
in
training
and
selecting
submarine
crews.
nasa
hopes
to
use
that
research
in
selecting
crews
for
long
range
space
missions.
in
addition
to
the
press
release,
the
respondents
issued
a
newsletter
in
april
of
1975
which
repeated
many
of
the
same
defamatory
statements.
this
newsletter
was
sent
to
over
100,000
persons.
some
of
whom
resided
in
the
senator's
home
state
of
wisconsin,
and
some
of
whom
did
not.
a
second
newsletter
was
issued
in
february
of
1976,
which
also
referred
to
dr.
hutchinson.
in
addition,
senator
proxmire
made
statements
regarding
dr.
hutchinson's
work
on
radio
and
television,
including
the
mike
douglas
show
where
the
senator
referred
to
dr.
hutchinson's
work
as
“the
most
outrageous
example
of
wasteful,
extravagant,
stupid
spending.”
in
addition
to
these
activities
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
no,
your
honor,
his
name
was
not
mentioned.
but
his
work
was
specified
in
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that's
correct.
his
work
was
specified
in
such
detail
that
he
could
be
identified
from
what
was
said.
and
in
fact
there
are
affidavits
in
the
record,
your
honor,
which
indicate
that
people
did
recognize
a
dr.
hutchinson
was
being
referred
to.
the
prior
press
release
issued
by
senator
proxmire
certainly
aided
in
the
identification
later
of
dr.
hutchinson.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
there
is
--
we
know
of
one
other
for
certain
is
the
bob
barry
show
which
is
referred
to
in
the
record.
in
addition,
there
may
have
been
other
ones.
the
senator
indicated
in
his
deposition
that
he
could
not
recall
if
there
are
other
ones.
i
believe
there
are
some
affidavits
in
the
record
which
we
filed
from
people
who
indicated
that
they
believe
that
they
heard
mention
of
this
sort
of
thing
and
other
entertainment
type
television
shows.
in
addition
to
these
actions,
after
the
press
release
was
issued,
the
senator's
aide
made
telephone
calls
to
the
various
funding
agencies.
during
some
of
those
calls,
defamatory
statements
were
made
and
pressure
was
apparently
exerted
on
those
agencies
to
cause
them
to
cease
funding
dr.
hutchinson's
work.
dr.
hutchinson
filed
suit
and
the
defendants
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
one,
that
the
press
release
and
the
newsletters
were
absolutely
immune
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
even
though
they
may
have
contained
defamatory
material.
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
radio
and
television
interviews
and
the
calls
to
the
funding
agencies
to
seek
termination
of
the
research
grants
were
not
immune
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
but
they
were
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
the
district
court
would've
extended
speech
or
debate,
i
believe
to
those
items
as
well,
but
the
--
it
is
correct
that
the
district
court
in
addition
found
that
petitioner
hutchinson
was
a
public
figure,
and
therefore,
there
was
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
the
court
of
appeals
narrowed
the
district
court's
finding.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
some
activity
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
in
fact
one
of
our
contentions
is
that
dr.
hutchinson
is
entitled
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
so
that
a
jury
or
other
trier
of
the
fact
can
consider
this
evidence
in
any
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
it.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
it
is.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
the
seventh
circuit
court
did
not
reach
the
state
law
issue.
they
would
appear
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
if
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
to
speak
frankly,
i
think
the
court's
decision
of
paul
versus
davis
would
indicate
that
the
torts
involved
do
not
invade
constitutional
rights.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
your
honor
in
paul
versus
davis,
the
court
considered
whether
invasion
of
privacy
could
rise
to
a
constitutional
level.
and
justice
rehnquist
writing
for
the
court
indicated
there
are
only
certain
limited
areas
in
which
an
invasion
of
privacy
would
rise
to
a
constitutional
level.
therefore,
while
we
would
hope
to
view
this
as
a
constitutional
issue,
i
think
realistically
that
the
court
has
discussed
at
least
in
dicta
in
paul
versus
davis
if
not
in
holding.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
well
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous
and
we
would
have
hoped
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
issue
and
we
would
hope
that
the
court
would
remand
for
a
determination
on
the
issue
after
the
court
would
rule
on
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor
it's
an
answer
i
was
embarrassed
to
give.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
i
think
the
other
answer
is
that
the
district
court
clearly
was
erroneous
on
the
state
law.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
has
a
right
to
review,
and
that
review
should
encompass
at
least
the
threshold
issue.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
in
my
remarks
today,
speak
to
two
issues.
the
first
is
speech
or
debate,
and
the
second
is
the
public
figure
issue.
article
i,
section
6
of
the
constitution
provides
the
senators
and
representatives
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
that
would
be
your
position.
our
position
is
that
a
jury
should
be
allowed
to
review
the
facts
and
the
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
those
facts
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
is
a
public
figure.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
your
honor,
that
it
would
appear
appropriate
to
reverse
the
lower
decisions
and
permit
the
petitioner
to
have
a
trial
on
the
issue.
in
understanding
our
speech
or
debate
position,
it's
as
important
to
understand
what
we
do
not
challenge
as
it
is
to
understand
what
we
do
challenge.
we
do
not
challenge
any
speech
by
senator
proxmire.
we
do
not
challenge
the
insertion
of
a
speech
in
the
congressional
record.
we
do
not
challenge
any
vote
or
any
action
taken
in
congress
or
in
committee.
we
do
challenge
a
defamatory
press
release
that
was
given
massive
publicity,
two
defamatory
newsletters
that
were
given
similar
dissemination,
radio
and
tv
appearances
and
the
telephone
calls
to
the
funding
agencies
to
seek
termination
to
of
dr.
hutchinson's
funding.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
each
press
release
was
sent
to
over
100,000
persons.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
no,
your
honor,
somewhere
in
wisconsin
and
somewhere
in
other
states.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
no,
your
honor,
the
only
statement
i
believe
is
in
senator
proxmire's
deposition
where
he
indicated
that
some
of
those
press
releases
were
sent
to
wisconsin,
and
others
were
sent
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
i'm
sorry,
newsletters.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
all
of
the
press
releases
were
sent
to
the
media.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
this
court
in
the
recent
past
has
set
out
at
least
on
three
occasions
that
publications
or
republications
outside
of
congress
are
not
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
in
united
states
versus
brewster,
a
criminal
bribery
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
congress
had
been
engaged
in
many
activities
that
are
critical
in
nature
rather
than
legislative.
specifically
mentioned
were
newsletters,
news
releases
and
speeches
outside
of
congress.
the
court
then
commented
that
it
is
never
seriously
been
contended
that
these
political
matters
are
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
in
gravel
versus
united
states,
private
publication
of
the
pentagon
papers
was
found
not
to
be
essential
to
the
deliberations
of
the
senate
and
not
part
and
parcel
of
the
legislative
process.
hence,
it
was
not
protected
by
speech
or
debate.
in
doe
versus
mcmillan,
it
was
held
that
committee
members
who
compiled
and
voted
to
publisher
report
were
immune
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
but
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
does
not
protect
a
private
republication
of
documents
introduced
and
made
public
at
a
committee
hearing.
the
court
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
a
member
of
congress
republished
libel
by
reading
from
a
record
from
a
congressional
committee
record
in
his
home
district,
he
would
not
be
immune
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
and
these
recent
statements
by
the
court
comply
with
the
historical
understanding
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
just
as
story,
145
years
ago
in
the
commentaries
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
stated
that
if
a
congressman
republished
a
defamatory
statement
that
it
was
originally
made
in
congress,
he
would
not
be
immune.
i
think
it's
worth
noting
how
far
the
defendants
have
gone
in
this
case
beyond
the
conduct
in
doe.
in
doe,
the
defendants
acted
as
a
congressional
committee
and
they
did
nothing
more
than
prepare
the
report
and
vote
along
with
the
rest
of
the
house
for
its
publication.
here
we
have
one
congressman
issuing
his
own
press
release
and
his
own
newsletters.
in
doe,
the
publication
was
very
limited.
it
was
limited
to
1,682
copies
that
were
sent
to
other
congressmen
and
to
the
usual
offices
that
received
printings.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
i
think
then
we
would
have
a
question
of
how
wide
was
the
dissemination.
if
the
dissemination
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
i
would
think
it
would
not
be
protected.
i
think
that
that
is
dissemination
beyond
a
legitimate
needs
of
congress,
and
therefore
would
not
be
protected.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor
if
it
was
an
action
taken
by
congress,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
immune.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
sir.
but
if
it
was
taken
--
if
the
action
was
taken
by
an
individual
congressman
and
it
is
disseminated
beyond
legitimate
legislative
needs
then
it
would
not
be
immune.
in
doe,
in
addition
to
the
publication
being
limited,
there
was
no
effort
to
call
attention
to
it.
in
the
present
case,
every
possible
effort
was
made
to
call
attention
to
the
new
release.
in
short,
in
the
present
case
we
do
not
have
congress
taking
action
or
a
committee
taking
action.
we
have
one
senator
issuing
a
press
release,
issuing
a
newsletter
in
giving
him
the
widest
possible
dissemination.
this
is
not
immune
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
public
figure
issue?
this
court
in
gertz
versus
robert
welch
indicated
that
there
were
two
types
of
public
figure.
first,
there
was
the
all
purpose
public
figure
which
was
described
as
a
person
with
pervasive
power
and
influence,
pervasive
fame
and
notoriety.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
parties
in
this
case
are
in
agreement
that
dr.
hutchinson
does
not
satisfy
that
definition.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
no,
your
honor,
in
fact
that
is
an
issue
that
we
have
specifically
not
conceded.
the
respondents
in
our
brief
indicated
in
a
footnote
that
apparently
we
had
conceded
the
point
that
the
same
standard
applies
to
public
or
to
private
defendants
as
would
apply
to
a
member
of
the
media.
your
honor,
we
do
not
think
that's
correct.
the
court
has
not
yet
addressed
that
issue.
justice
burger
or
chief
justice
burger
in
a
recent
concurring
opinion
pointed
that
out
that
the
court
had
not
yet
squarely
faced
that
issue.
and
there
is
considerable
speculation
in
the
legal
community
that
perhaps
different
standards
do
apply
to
private
citizens.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
your
honor
there
are.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
it
may
well
be
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
no,
we
have
not.
and
the
reason
that
we
have
not
is
simply
this.
new
york
times
involved
both
media
defendants
and
none
media
defendants.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
it
would
appear
from
the
ruling
in
new
york
times
that
there
was
an
assumption
that
the
same
rule
would
apply
to
both
types
of
defendants.
now
since
that
time
in
gertz
and
in
the
other
public
figure
cases,
the
court
seems
to
have
rather
carefully
indicated
that
the
defendant
was
a
media
defendant.
but
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
argument
we
have
assumed
that
this
is
the
same
standard
would
apply,
but
i
think
that
the
court
is
not
foreclosed
the
possibility
that
different
standards
would
apply
to
the
two
types
of
defendants.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
dr.
hutchinson
fell
within
the
second
category
of
public
figures,
the
limited
public
figures.
these
were
described
as
people
who
have
voluntarily
thrust
themselves
into
the
forefront
of
a
particular
public
controversy
in
order
to
influence
the
resolution
of
the
issue
involved.
in
other
places
in
the
opinion
these
persons
who
were
referred
to
as
person
who
had
voluntarily
injected
themselves
into
an
issue,
persons
who
would
assume
special
prominence
in
resolution
of
a
particular
dispute.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
four
factors
in
finding
that
dr.
hutchinson
was
a
limited
public
figure.
first,
the
court
relied
upon
his
solicitation
of
federal
funds.
second,
the
published
articles
about
dr.
hutchinson's
work;
third
about
the
stories
that
appeared
about
dr.
hutchinson
in
local
newspapers;
fourth,
the
court
relied
upon
the
fact
that
it
believed
dr.
hutchinson
had
sufficient
access
to
the
media
to
reply
to
the
statement.
to
these
four
grounds,
the
respondents
would
add
a
fifth
which
is
that
dr.
hutchinson's
research
department
was
the
subject
of
a
public
audit
in
the
state
of
michigan
after
the
press
release,
apparently
after
the
first
newsletter
and
after
the
telephone
calls
to
the
funding
agencies,
but
prior
to
some
of
the
other
publications.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
it's
a
bootstrap
argument
that
anyone
who
is
defamed
by
united
states
senator
is
going
to
become
a
public
figure
and
there's
going
to
be
a
serving
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
sir.
and
he
is
going
to
have
some
access
to
the
media
because
the
media
will
call
him
for
his
response.
and
so
the
--
a
very
public
defendant
such
as
a
senator
could
make
anyone
a
public
figure
if
that
were
the
test.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
regard
to
the
--
dr.
hutchinson's
publications,
his
publications
have
consisted
of
four
or
five
chapters
in
books,
and
several
articles
that
he
has
published.
all
of
those
were
scholarly
articles
setting
forth
the
results
of
his
research.
they
did
not
advocate
a
position
in
public
funding.
they
did
not
to
seek
to
thrust
him
to
the
forefront
of
any
issue
involving
the
continuation
of
public
funding.
it's
important
to
note
that
in
gertz,
the
court
noted
that
mr.
gertz
had
published
many
articles
and
many
books,
yet
he
was
found
not
to
be
a
public
figure.
in
regard
to
the
articles
that
appeared
in
the
local
papers,
in
fact
there
was
only
one
local
paper.
and
out
of
the
seven
stories
that
appeared,
only
one
can
be
called
a
true
story.
the
other
six
were
simply
notices
indicating
that
dr.
hutchinson
had
been
promoted
at
the
university
or
something
of
that
nature.
the
publication
that
there
was
about
dr.
hutchinson
prior
to
this
release
was
limited
solely
to
one
newspaper
in
kalamazoo.
this
is
in
startling
contrast
to
the
publication
in
firestone,
justice
marshall
in
his
dissent
that
mrs.
firestone
had
been
a
subject
of
over
80
newspaper
articles
during
the
course
of
the
divorce
proceedings,
yet
she
was
found
not
to
be
a
public
figure.
the
last
item
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
receipt
of
federal
funding.
as
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae,
the
american
psychological
association
points
out
over
72%
now
of
research
that
is
related
to
universities
is
funded
by
the
united
states
government.
if
that
were
the
tests,
we
would
be
making
virtually
every
researcher
a
public
figure.
but
more
importantly
than
that,
merely
by
seeking
public
funds,
a
researcher
that
does
not
thrust
himself
into
the
forefront
of
any
public
issue.
so
we
would
submit
that
that
cannot
be
the
test.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
the
$900,000.00
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
and
$900,000.00
is
a
high
figure.
it's
something
less
than
nine
--
it
was
near
700,000
or
800,000.
but
at
any
rate,
the
money
was
paid
by
the
federal
agencies
to
the
state
of
michigan
or
to
the
other
sponsoring
authority.
the
research
before
it
is
funded
is
carefully
evaluated
by
the
funding
agencies
in
a
pure
review
committee.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
i
think
while
the
researcher
should
be
prepared
to
defend
his
funding,
he
should
not
be
given
a
status
of
public
figure
so
that
he
has
to
rise
to
the
high
level
of
meeting
actual
malice
before
he
can
maintain
an
action,
because
in
addition
to
the
researcher
defending
the
action,
the
agencies
themselves
that
fund
it
can
defend
the
action.
and
that's
where
i
think
that
the
public
or
a
congressman
should
look
for
justification
rather
than
the
researcher.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
but
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
but
your
honor
if
we
accepted
that
standard
we
would
be
back
to
the
metro
media
standard,
which
is
that
it
is
a
matter
of
general
interest
to
the
public.
and
therefore,
anyone
who
happens
to
be
involved
in
it
can
be
slandered
anymore
show
actual
malice
before
he
can
recover.
the
court
has
left
that
mark
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
thank
you.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honors,
mr.
raywid
just
comment
that
this
case
does
not
involve
a
case
of
exposure
for
the
sake
of
exposure.
we
would
vigorously
disagree
with
that.
that
appears
to
us
to
be
exactly
what
occurred
here.
senator
proxmire's
devout
purpose
was
to
award
the
golden
fleece
to
funding
agencies
for
the
funding
that
they
had
granted.
there
was
no
need
to
name
dr.
hutchinson
by
name.
there
was
no
need
to
ridicule
and
humiliate
dr.
hutchinson.
there
was
no
need
to
send
this
press
release
in
addition
to
every
newspaper
and
member
of
the
media
of
the
united
states,
to
members
of
the
press
in
japan,
italy,
britain,
and
canada.
the
senator's
press
releases
may
be
entertaining
to
read
and
they
may
be
entertaining
on
television
talk
shows,
but
to
the
people
in
kalamazoo,
michigan
to
the
victims
in
madison,
wisconsin
and
the
victims
in
the
other
places
in
the
united
states
they're
devastating,
they
humiliate,
they
ridicule
and
they
emotionally
cripple.
what
can
a
man
who's
been
a
victim
of
one
of
these
releases
say
to
his
children
when
he
comes
home?
what
can
his
children
tell
to
their
schoolmates?
the
court
has
always
attempted
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
individual
and
his
reputation
would
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that's
right,
nor
do
they
do
those
unfortunate
people
in
japan
who
receive
these
newsletters
or
the
press
releases.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
certainly
is
a
major
element,
but
there
also
is
damage
just
to
the
people
who
know
dr.
hutchinson
as
a
person.
in
effect
a
press
release
like
this
calls
a
man
a
charlatan
or
a
fraud,
accuses
him
of
taking
government
money
for
doing
worthless
work.
you
could
take
the
same
approach
and
describe
a
scientist
discovering
penicillin
as
some
charlatan
taking
money
to
watch
bread
mold.
it's
simply
unfair
and
what
the
senate
is
asking
us
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
totally
disregard
the
balancing
process
that
has
occurred
in
the
past,
and
to
grant
senators
absolute
immunity
for
anything
they
say
at
time
in
any
place
no
matter
how
widely
it
is
disseminated.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
he
is.
a
public
official
is
jived
and
defined
as
a
person
who
occupies
a
high
public
position
who
would
be
the
subject
of
interest
without
the
controversy.
in
this
case,
dr.
hutchinson
was
director
of
research
of
kalamazoo
state
hospital.
he
had
10
or
11
employees
under
his
supervision.
he
could
not
hire,
he
could
not
fire.
he
had
very
little
discretion.
he
could
respond
to
a
contract
request
from
a
federal
agency
but
he
would
respond
through
his
employing
department.
he
was
no
different
in
the
type
of
position
that
he
had
really
than
someone
who
is
director
of
nursing
at
the
institution
or
director
of
physical
facilities.
that
he
is
not
the
type
of
public
official
that
i
think
the
court
had
in
mind
in
the
cases
where
public
official
is
spoken
of.
he
was
not
an
elected
official
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
one
test.
the
number
of
people
under
him
is
a
measure
of
his
responsibility.
if
responsibility
is
the
test,
dr.
hutchinson
had
no
authority
to
spend
the
money
that
senator
proxmire
has
referred
to.
it
was
sent
to
the
state
of
michigan,
and
mostly
hutchinson
could
do
was
to
submit
a
purchase
request
or
a
voucher
for
payment
of
salaries.
the
people
who
control
the
funding
were
the
funding
agencies
in
washington,
and
then
the
agencies
in
michigan
that
received
the
funds.
dr.
hutchinson
was
merely
another
civil
service
employee.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
an
officer
of
the
state,
sir?
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
he
was
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
he
was
an
employee
of
the
state,
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor
he
can
inform
without
defaming.
he
should
not
need
absolute
immunity
to
say
the
boldest
lie.
it
should
be
enough
that
he
can
tell
the
truth
to
his
constituents
or
the
other
members
of
the
nation.
he
certainly
can
say
anything
to
other
congressman
and
have
absolutely
immunity.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yur
honor,
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
it's
difficult
to
say
how
many
members
of
the
media
to
pay
attention
to
one
of
these
golden
fleece
is
two
weeks
after
it
is
issued.
it's
certainly
sensational
when
it
is
issued,
and
it
gets
coverage
simply
because
it
is
sensational
because
of
the
witty
things
that
it
says.
but
your
honor
i'm
not
sure
that
that
ultimately
is
given
any
more
attention
than
would
a
factual
truth
worthy
or
truthful
newsletter
or
press
release.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
if
he
makes
a
statement,
it
is
his
obligation
to
defend
it.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
of
mr.
raywid's
statement
that
he
does
not
even
have
to
file
an
answer.
i
believe
the
law
is
that
a
senator
does
have
to
file
an
answer.
he
could
raise
speech
and
debate
then
if
it's
a
legitimate
activity,
and
he
certainly
could
ask
to
have
the
case
move
to
some
other
form.
but
if
the
senator
makes
a
defamatory
statement
and
broadcast
it
so
widely
that
it
reaches
hawaii
then
i
don't
think
it's
unfair
to
initially
to
require
him
to
appear
there
through
counsel
to
defend
it.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
if
it's
within
the
privilege.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor
i
don't
believe
congress
could,
because
if
you
said
that
congress
could
do
that
then
you're
saying
that
congress
has
the
power
to
rewrite
the
constitution
and
that
congress
has
the
power
to
say
how
broad
the
protection
is
afforded
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
then,
your
honor,
i
presume
our
cause
of
action
would
be
in
a
higher
court,
perhaps
in
front
of
this
court
as
you
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
would
deprive
the
victim
of
his
right
to
appear
in
some
court,
perhaps
state
court
perhaps
a
higher
federal
court
that
congress
has
not
created.
if
--
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that's
right,
your
honor
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
yes,
sir.
your
honor
we
would
respectfully
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
lower
decisions
and
permit
dr.
hutchinson
to
have
his
day
in
courts
that
he
may
vindicate
his
reputation.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
two
separate
immunities.
the
senator's
immunity
is
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
the
press'
immunity
is
the
common
law
that
has
been
developed.
and
the
common
law
has
recognized
a
qualified
privilege
for
members
of
the
media
to
accurately
report
what
has
taken
place
in
congress
or
in
a
court.
but
they're
two
separate
immunities.
with
the
senator,
i
think
under
doe,
if
he
publicizes
the
action
taken
or
the
speech
made
wider
than
is
necessary
for
legitimate
legislative
needs,
he
has
exceeded
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
there
is
liability.
mr.
michael
e.
cavanaugh
your
honor,
we
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
that
a
newsletter
to
a
hundred
thousand
people
in
wisconsin
and
outside
of
wisconsin
is
not
within
the
legitimate
legislative
needs
of
congress.
it
is
a
personal
political
act.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
