of
paper
in

by
whom?

to
complain.
justice

the
trouble

couldn't
choose
between
michigan
and
wisconsin,
you
acted
--
you
just
got
to
get
more
at
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
so
you
don't
get
to
be
really
whether
or
not
it
is
libel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
when
you
get
to
whether
or
not
that's
a
libel
you're
going
to
be
in
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
mind
if
we
go
the
other
way
and
say
you
don't
touch
it
all.
you
don't
mind
it's
going
that
way
do
you?
justice

was
an
officer
of
the
state,

he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
usually
they
are.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
usually
the
officers
of
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
say
about
the
protection
of
the
senator
from
having
to
go
before
a
court
on
the
island
of
maui
in
the
hawaiian
islands
and
defend
the
statement
that
he
made?
justice
