do
they
strip
containers?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they're
not
subject
to
that
type
of
work?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ford
is
special,
he's
not
subject
to
that
assignment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
that
definition
of
yours
include
mr.
justice
white's
truck
driver
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
would
he
be
excluded?
tell
me
how
he
would
be
excluded.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
said
most
of
his
efforts.
so
i
guess
we
can
all
agree
to
that
but
in
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
in
mr.
justice
white's
illustration,
he
was
doing
something
more
than
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
caputo
case
--
the
opinion
expressly
excluded
the
truck
driver.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
my
question
of
course
is
whether
your
proposed
test
doesn't
include
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
may
well,
what
about
a
clerical
employee
who's
doing
clerical
work
in
connection
with
moving
cargo
from
--
within
the
maritime
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
a
trucker?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
he
had
a
truck
driver
--
what
if
he
had
a
truck
driver
who
worked
exclusively
on
the
pier
between,
say
a
warehouse
and
hauling
cargo
from
the
warehouse
to
a
railroad
pick
up?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
a
truck
driver
he
would
be
covered?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
within
the
railroad
to
which
he
is
delivered
it
was
five
miles
off
the
maritime
site.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
he
regularly
picked
--
took
it
up
from
the
warehouse
on
the
site
to
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
railroad
station
five
miles
away?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
could
be
under
your
definition
as
i
understand
your
brief.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
regularly
worked
within
the
terminal
moving
cargo
between
maritime
transportation
and
land
transportation,
everyday
he
does
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
all
day
but
he
does
for
the
first
portion
of
his
journey.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
--
is
your
test
limited
to
the
case
in
which
the
land
transportation
commences
within
the
terminal,
is
that
the
test?
