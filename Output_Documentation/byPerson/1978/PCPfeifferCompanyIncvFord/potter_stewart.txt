justice
potter
stewart
mr.
vickery,
this
case
doesn't
involve
any
controversy
about
situs,
does
it,
but
only
about
status?
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
exist.
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
over
the
question
of
status.
justice
potter
stewart
hmm,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
brief,
mr.
vickery
you
urged
the
court
not
to
place
too
much
or
any
emphasis
in
its
test
in
determining
status
on
whether
or
not
the
claimant
is
a
longshoreman,
at
least
as
i
read
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
although
the
statute
does
make
that
one
of
the
tests,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
right,
so
then
being
a
longshoreman
is
part
of
the
test
or
one
of
the
tests,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
statute
whether
we
like
it
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
the
teamsters
local,
would
then
that
trucking
company
had
said
in
this
case,
we're
going
to
call
every
truck
driver
a
longshoreman
and
that's
your
job,
longshoreman,
just
because
you
might
someday
want
to
get
the
advantage
of
this
federal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
make
him
a
longshoreman
if
he's
called
so
and
if
that's
a
job
classification?
justice
potter
stewart
--
hmm?
justice
potter
stewart
why
does
it
exist?
what
is
it?
what
--
in
your
submission,
what
is
the
test?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
says
--
the
statute
says
including
any
longshoreman
and
so
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
day
he
was
hurt
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
according
to
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
his
job
description
is?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
his
job
description
is
something
else
like
a
laborer
or
messenger
or
something
else.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
that's
covered
by
other
persons
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
covered
by
other
person
engaged
in
longshoring
operations?
justice
potter
stewart
what
i'm
--
my
question
goes
to
what
your
understanding
is
of
the
statutory
meaning
of
longshoreman.
that
wasn't
clear
to
me
from
reading
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
why
isn't
it
tautological
in
view
of
the
other
statutory
language
person
engaged
in
longshoring
operations?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
why
isn't
--
why
is
it
--
how
--
wholly
meaningless
if
that's
all
it
means?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that's
the
definition
of
what
a
longshoreman
is.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
it
on
the
day
of
the
accident,
what
if
he
was
a
longshoreman
up
until
yesterday?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
are
there?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
know
but
that's
a
separate
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
stat
--
a
separate
statutory
language.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
our
duty
to
try
to
give
meaning
to
every
word
of
the
statute
if
we
can.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
did
the
ninth
circuit
--
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
wasn't
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whatever
the
word
means,
you
think
he
has
to
be
that
at
the
time
that
he's
injured
or
killed?
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
if
he'd
never
been
a
longshoreman,
maybe
he'd
been
a
electro
--
a
lawyer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
until
this
morning
he
was
hired
as
a
longshoreman,
if
he
is
here
--
if
he
is
killed
today
then
he
is
a
longshoreman
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he'd
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
vickery,
its
not
your
contention
that
the
injured
employee
has
to
be
engaged
in
work
on
mari
--
navigable
waters
at
the
time
of
his
injury
to
be
covered
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
case
and
some
of
the
other
cases
were
purely
situs
cases,
weren't
they?
o'rourke
was
a
--
as
i
remember
a
brakeman
for
the
pennsylvania
railroad?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
his
job.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
was
injured
on
navigable
waters
and
therefore
it
was
held
that
the
fela
was
not
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
a
situs
case.
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
he
is
a
railroad
brakeman.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
wasn't
a
status,
it
was
a
situs
case.
justice
potter
stewart
was
an
employer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
within
the
meaning
of
the
then
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
but
is
it
--
the
o'rourke
case
was
the
one
--
i
haven't
read
it
for
a
long,
justice
reed
wrote
it,
that
was
a
five
to
four
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
mr.
justice
reed
wrote
the
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it
is
over
by
both
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
and
mr.
bryson,
what
do
you
think
the
phrase
maritime
employment
means?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
has
been
defined
rather
--
it's
become
almost
a
term
of
art
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
hasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
indeed
the
predecessor
statute
required
the
employer
to
be
in
the
maritime
employment
in
order
to
be
a
covered
employer.
he
had
to
have
some
of
his
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
maritime
employment
and
that
was
given
a
specific
and
almost
--
became
almost
a
term
of
art,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
maritime
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
maritime
employment
hasn't
been
defined
at
all,
has
it?
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
so
wouldn't
it
be
the
national
thing
to
look
at
--
to
see
what
that
term
means
in
the
decisions
of
the
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
are
because
they're
specifically
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
why
we're
here.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
a
shipbreaker?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
set
foot
on
navigable
waters
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
that
go
very
far
toward
a
--
as
i
think
was
suggested
in
question
a
few
moments
ago
by
my
brother
blackmun,
doesn't
that
go
very
far
toward
eliminating
this
--
the
status
requirement
in
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
the
employer
is
a
covered
employer
could
--
because
he
has
other
employees
who
work
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
doesn't
that
go
awfully
forward
toward
eliminating
the
status
requirement
as
to
the
employee,
the
claimant?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
one
thing
if
their
employer
is
not
covered,
they
are
not
covered.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he's
not
in
“employer”
as
defined
by
the
act?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
if
he
is
not
then
they're
not
covered.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
is,
they
may
or
may
not
be
covered.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
clerical
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
unloading
but
not
how
about
the
loading?
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
discredited
point
of
rest
test,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
result
might
have
been
different
if
he
had
not
been.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
hard
to
tell
from
that
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it
should
be
--
an
opinion
as
a
matter
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
was
that
in
that
--
this
case,
with
respect
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
really
the
petitioner's
test.
its
--
more
accurately
what
the
petitioner
says,
the
statutory
test
is.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
--
suppose
a
vessel
weren't
there
on
the
date
of
the
injury,
the
--
under
his
--
i
understand
the
--
what
the
petitioner
thinks
the
statute
means
will
tell
us
the
statute
means
then
he
wouldn't
be
covered.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
not,
maybe
nothing
in
the
statute
that's
very
good
sense
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
we're
--
our
duty
is
to
decide
what
the
statute
means.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
was
not.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
that's
--
the
petitioners
certainly
wouldn't
agree
with
you.
justice
potter
stewart
assigned
in
that
day
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
being
assigned
--
justice
potter
stewart
he'd
be
covered.
justice
potter
stewart
footnote
36
on
page
13?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
vickery,
looking
at
the
definition
of
the
term
employee
in
section
2
(3),
it
says
as
you
indicate
that
it
means
first
of
all
that
any
person
engaged
in
maritime
employment
including
and
then
it
says
including
a
ship
repairman,
a
shipbuilder
and
a
shipbreaker.
is
it
your
contention
that
for
ship
repairmen
or
shipbuilder
or
shipbreaker
to
be
covered
by
this
act,
he
must
be
subject
on
the
day
of
his
injury
or
death
to
assignment
on
work
on
navigable
waters?
justice
potter
stewart
that
can
be
answered
yes
or
no,
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
he
is
a
shipbuilder,
full
time,
life
long
career,
a
shipbuilder
but
he's
a
shipbuilder
--
on
building
a
ship
before
it
whatever
is
on
navigable
waters,
then
he's
not
covered
at
all
and
never
was
and
never
can
be
by
this
act,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
what
the
statute
does
express
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
my
--
my
question
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
longshoring
operations.
there's
a
different
part
of
the
definition
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
an
employee.
it
means
any
person
engaged
in
maritime
employment
including
a
shipbuilder.
now,
that's
--
there's
no
claim
that
he
is
a
longshoreman
or
anything
like
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
let's
assume
that
he
is
and
always
has
been
during
his
occupation
in
life,
a
shipbuilder
but
that
his
work
is
in
building
ships
before
they
are
ever
on
navigable
waters.
your
--
your
argument
has
to
be
that
he's
not
covered
at
all
by
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
do
concede
that
there
are
shipbuilders
all
of
whose
occupational
time
is
spent
not
on
navigable
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
30
to
35%
that's
not.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
is
subject
on
the
day
of
his
injury
or
death
to
assignment
to
navigable
waters
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
his
occupation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he
is
not
covered
by
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
he
was.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
some
of
them
in
world
war
ii,
i
remember
in
iowa
as
i
remember
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
