mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
the
longshoremen's
act
as
applied
in
1970
as
amended
in
1972
applies
to
employees
engaged
in
handling
cargo
on
the
waterfront.
now,
the
position
of
the
department
of
labor
is
that
the
act
applies
to
all
waterfront
employees
who
are
engaged
in
the
process
of
transferring
cargo
between
land
and
water
transportation.
now,
the
petitioners
have
characterized
the
department's
position
as
being
somewhat
broader
than
that,
it
is
not.
the
position
is
that
with
respect
to
cargo
handling,
it
is
necessary
that
the
employee
be
engaged
in
the
process
of
moving
cargo
between
land
and
sea
transportation.
now,
the
board
and
the
director
have
reached
this
position
as
a
matter
of
construing
the
statutory
term
longshoring
operations.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
it
would
not
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
the
reason
would
be
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there
--
essentially
the
reason
is
that
that
truck
driver
would
not
be
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
that
truck
driver
would
be
engaged
in
employment.
most
of
his
employment
was
--
would
be
looking
towards
the
land.
he
would
engaged
in
--
most
of
his
conduct,
most
of
his
daily
conduct
in
moving
cargo
between
the
maritime
and
--
marine
terminal
and
points
inland
of
that
and
his
job
basically
would
not
be
a
maritime
job.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly,
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
caputo
case,
the
whole
thrust
of
the
act
is
to
look
to
the
nature
of
employment
not
the
particular
act
of
the
employee,
he
is
engaged
in
at
the
time.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
i
think
not
and
the
reason
being
that
we
focused
on
the
marine
terminal
worker
because
this
is
a
person
who
spends
all
of
his
time
who
as
a
matter
of
profession,
as
a
matter
of
occupation,
is
someone
who
is
constantly
dealing
with
cargo
that
has
immediately
been
unloaded
from
a
vessel
or
is
about
to
be
loaded
on
to
a
vessel.
he
is
like
the
harbor
worker
or
like
the
shipbuilder
or
like
the
ship
repairer,
a
person
who
is
there
on
the
marine
situs,
on
the
maritime
situs
is
dealing
day
in
and
day
out
with
cargo
that
is
immediately
to
be
loaded
or
immediately
unloaded
from
a
vessel.
the
truck
driver
comes
in
once
a
week
or
whatever
and
moves
on
to
land
occupation.
his
occupation
is
not
that
that
could
be
fairly
be
termed
maritime
employment.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
term
of
course
is
not
given
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
decisions
of
the
court
which
counsel
referred
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
had
to
have
some
of
his
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
had
some
of
his
employment
--
employees
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
engaged
in
--
over
navigable
waters.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
now,
navigable
waters
has
been
redefined.
of
course,
in
the
72
act
to
include
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
maritime
employment
has
not
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
been
defined.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
but
the
problem
mr.
justice
stewart
with
trying
to
define
maritime
employment
the
way
it
was
used
although
i
think
not
defined
in
the
old
cases.
the
way
it
was
used
to
the
extent
that
it
was
used
to
suggest
that
maritime
employment
was
limited
to
employment
which
actually
occurred
over
water
is
that
that
would
not
take
care
of
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
maritime
employment
there
involved
in
the
1972
amendments
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
for
instance,
ship
builders.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right
but
the
statute
says
maritime
employment
and
then
proceeds
to
include
a
number
of
groups
within
that
concept
of
maritime
employment
and
the
legislative
history
on
that
point
is
quite
clear
that
it
means
the
entire
group
of
specific
occupations
to
be
within
the
notion
of
maritime
employment.
if
i
can
read
from
the
section,
the
section
analysis
in
the
senate
report,
it
says
the
amendment
amends
section
2
(3)
of
the
act
to
define
an
employee
as
any
person
engaged
in
maritime
employment
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
the
definition
specifically
includes
any
longshoreman
or
other
person
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
and
any
harbor
worker
including
the
ship
repairman,
shipbuilder
and
shipbreaker.
now,
congress
knew,
it
was
clear
in
1972
that
there
were
a
number
of
different
types
of
say,
to
--
just
to
take
an
example,
shipbuilders
who
never
set
foot
on
the
water,
who
would
never
be
on
the
haul
of
a
ship
after
it
was
launched.
these
are
people
who
are
spending
their
time
working
on
land
in
a
maritime
situs
but
who
are
doing
work
which
is
so
interrelated
to
maritime
navigation
and
commerce
that
congress
saw
fit
to
bring
it
within
the
definition
of
maritime
employment.
now,
they
did
not
define
the
term
of
course
and
that's
why
so
much
trouble
has
ensued
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
in
trying
to
find
the
statute.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
a
shipbreaker
i
believe
is
someone
who
is
either
in
the
conversion,
it's
a
form
of
ship
repair,
that
i
think
it's
a
form
of
converting
ships
from
one
form
to
another.
but
the
point
is
though
that
there
are
a
number
of
these
individuals
who
never
set
foot
on
land
including
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
excuse
me,
on
sea.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
on
navigable
waters
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
as
it
used
to
be
defined.
of
course,
they
spend
all
their
time
on
navigable
waters,
that
is
--
as
it
is
now
defined,
because
it's
been
defined
to
include
all
of
these
maritime
situs
areas
such
as
a
dock,
a
pier,
a
wharf,
a
building
way
and
so
forth.
now,
the
director
and
the
board
have
looked
at
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
for
the
purpose
--
well,
they
are
clearly
two
different
entities.
the
director
is
the
delegee
of
the
secretary
of
labor
who
is
charged
with
administering
the
act
and
appears
as
a
party
seeking
to
--
in
this
case
support
the
board's
order.
now,
i'm
impressed
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
director
is
designated
to
defend
the
board's
orders
and
i
do
not
know
that
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
believe
in
the
statute,
there
is
a
provision
which
provide
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
in
the
statute
there's
a
provision
which
provides
that
the
secretary
of
labor
shall
assign
attorneys
to
administer
the
act
and
to
--
i
believe
it
says
to
defend
the
board's
orders
as
well.
now
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
then
it
--
and
there
have
been
some
cases
in
which
the
board
has
been
named
as
a
party.
some
of
the
cases
is
--
it's
come
to
be
the
fashion
to
characterize
the
director
as
the
--
as
a
party
but
it
could
well
be
the
board
as
in
the
national
labor
relations
board
cases.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
here,
because
what
happened
here
that
--
although
there
is
some
dispute
in
--
as
to
whether
the
board
has
the
power
--
excuse
me,
the
director
has
the
power
to
seek
review
of
the
board
order
which
is
contrary
to
the
director's
position.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
director's
position
and
the
private
party's
position
that
was
sustained
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
sustained
in
the
board
and
so
that
the
director's
standing
is
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
no
not
here.
there
have
been
cases
in
which
is
there
is
internal
inconsistency
but
not
here.
in
fact,
the
board
and
the
director
from
the
beginning
have
taken
the
same
position
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
the
terms
lonshoring
operation
and
maritime
employment.
by
defining
those
terms
to
include
the
entire
operation
in
the
marine
terminal
with
respect
to
cargo
handling
and
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
doesn't
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
with
respect
to
cargo
handlers,
it
certainly
does.
in
our
view,
cargo
handlers
are
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
and
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
go
any
farther
to
determine
that
that's
maritime
employment
so
there
is
no
further
status
inquiry
that
has
to
be
made.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
now,
the
legislative
history
does
point
out
that
certain
kinds
of
employees
even
though
they
may
be
there
on
the
situs
are
not
covered
and
that
would
include
for
instance
clerical
employees.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
their
employer
is
--
their
employer
maybe
covered.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
he
may
be
an
employer
and
then
they
still
not
be
covered.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
the
--
if
he
is
covered
though,
they
--
for
instance
in
the
case
of
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
clerical
employees
may
well
not
be
because
it's
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that
--
that
gets
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
exactly
right.
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
gets
to
a
line,
it's
a
difficult
line
to
draw
and
it
is
a
line
which
has
come
up
in
a
couple
of
cases
although
not
too
often.
the
clerical
workers
tend
not
to
suffer
very
many
injuries
and
there
haven't
been
--
there
are
many
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
would
be
covered.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
he
would
be
covered
because
he
would
be
engaged
in
the
overall
process
of
moving
the
cargo
in
the
marine
terminal
area
between
the
vessel
and
the
land
for
the
land
transportation
which
is
the
railroad
which
would
take
it
off.
now,
he
would
be
covered
because
in
our
view,
he'd
be
engaged
in
longshoring
operations.
for
instance
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
it
was
off
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
a
difficult
question
to
answer.
i
don't
know
that
that
sort
of
situation
appears
very
often
in
the
industry
but
the
answer
to
that
would
depend
i
think
--
if
he
is
picking
up
the
cargo
at
the
terminal
and
carrying
it
on
and
just
essentially
being
a
middleman
between
the
terminal
and
a
further
land
transportation
which
is
as
i
understand
your
example,
i
would
say
he
would
not
be
covered
because
he
would
not
be
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
his
case
would
be
a
case
in
which
he
was
not
working
at
the
terminal
moving
things
through
the
terminal,
rather
he
is
taking
it
from
the
terminal,
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical
and
moving
it
from
the
terminal
to
a
further
transfer
point
outside
of
the
terminal.
but
if
he
were,
for
instance
as
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
he
is
not
working
within
the
confines
of
the
terminal.
he
is
taking
things
from
the
edge
of
the
terminal
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
portion
of
the
journey
in
which
he
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
where
the
land
transportation
commences
at
the
interface
between
the
term
--
where
the
terminal
employees
give
the
cargo
over
to
a
mode
of
land
transportation
at
that
point
and
the
land
transportation
takes
it
elsewhere.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
in
the
case
of
loading,
the
reverse
should
apply.
that
he
would
not
be
covered
if
he
were
bringing
the
cargo
into
the
terminal
even
if
it
were
not
at
the
edge
of
the
terminal
physically
but
actually
put
it
down
within
30
feet
inside
the
terminal
or
wherever.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
not.
the
--
the
point
of
rest
test
of
course
distinguished
within
the
terminal
between
where
the
cargo
came
off
the
vessel
and
was
placed
down
and
so
forth.
here
we're
talking
about
the
edge
of
the
terminal
which
is
the
status,
excuse
me,
the
situs
line.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
it
may
not
be
but
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
in
the
ford
case
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
i
think
not
because
he
would
be
basically
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
place
in
which
this
land
transportation
agent
is
picking
up
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
may
have
your
hypothetical
somewhat
mixed
up.
the
--
this
is
a
process
in
which
we
have
unloaded
a
vessel.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
i
would
say
none
of
those
three
cases
would
be
covered.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
i
think
none
of
those
three
cases
would
be
covered.
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
--
well,
but
the
point
is
that
the
railroad
employee
here
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
and
if
the
--
his
basic
employment
was
to
move
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
would
say
he
would
not
be
covered
because
he
would
be
moving
basically
engaged
in
land
transportation
into
a
marine
terminal
and
further
activities
once
you
get
to
the
marine
terminal,
further
activities
within
the
terminal
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that
is
different.
it's
an
important
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
an
important
element
in
determining
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
because
he's
basically
engaged
in
transporting
cargo
from
a
marine
terminal
to
somewhere
else.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i'm
sorry,
i
did
misunderstand
your
example.
i
--
where
the
railroad
spur
is
within
the
marine
terminal,
he
would
be
covered.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i'm
--
i
am
sorry,
i
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
it
is
right
at
the
edge,
if
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
it's
six
inches
outside
the
edge,
i
think
he
would
also
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
the
kind
of
problem
you're
going
to
get.
i
understand.
i
am
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
problem
is
that
this
situation
doesn't
appear
very
often
in
the
industry.
now,
that
it's
a
difficult
line
to
draw
of
course
with
respect
to
this
--
the
statute
which
has
very
general
statutory
language
about
what
constitutes
longshoring
operations
but
the
general
pattern
in
the
industry
is
for
the
spur
to
go
into
the
marine
terminal
and
you
have
people
who
are
employed
by
the
marine
terminal
to
transfer
cargo
from
the
vessel
or
from
the
place
inside
the
marine
terminal
to
the
spur
that's
located
right
there.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
now,
he
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
may
--
it
may
be
that
he
is
basically
employed
on
the
situs.
he
is
em
--
if
he's
employed
by
an
employer
that
he
spends
a
lot
of
his
time
on
the
situs
that
he's
basically
a
terminal
worker
but
he
may
occasionally
go
off
the
terminal
and
deliver
something.
the
fact
that
he
goes
off
the
term
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
in
these
cases
it
was
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
--
the
terminal
is
generally
defined
by
the
relationship
of
the
land
transportation
and
the
sea,
transmittal
of
cargo
between
the
sea
and
the
land
transportation
device
as
either
the
railroad
or
a
truck.
now,
in
the
caputo
case
itself,
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
--
where
the
limits
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
when
it's
on
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
may
well
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
in
many
cases
for
instance
as
in
the
port
of
beaumont,
there
is
a
sign
that
says
this
is
the
port
of
beaumont
and
in
some
cases
it's
true.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
true.
that's
true.
it
--
it
may
create
some
difficulty
in
determining
exactly
what
the
limits
of
the
terminal
are
but
there
aren't
very
--
many
cases
that
we've
had
to
look
at
in
which
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that
truck
driver
--
i
believe,
although
i'm
not
sure
that
the
record
reflects
it.
i
believe
that
truck
driver
was
not
employed
by
an
employer.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
he
were
employed
by
the
terminal
operator
let's
say,
i
would
think
he
would
be
covered
because
he'd
be
moving
between
one
facility
of
the
terminal
and
another
where
you'd
basically
--
well,
that
may
be
and
he
would
still
be
--
because
the
cargo
had
not
been
unloaded
at
that
point
he
would
still
be
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
that
the
usual
pattern
is
for
the
railroad
spur
to
be
coming
up
to
the
terminal
and
if
it
is
the
employee
of
the
terminal
operator
that
is
doing
the
moving,
he
would
be
engaged
in
longshoring
operations.
now,
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
i
think
that's
one
way
of
putting
it.
it
isn't
the
way
i
would
put
it
but
i
think
that's
accurate
and
the
definition
of
navigable
waters
is
the
way
congress
did
just
that.
they
said,
the
jensen
line
will
be
moved
from
the
gangplank
to
the
edge
of
the
marine
terminal
and
they
used
the
word
terminal
in
def
--
redefining
navigable
waters.
now,
the
petitioners
have
proposed
a
test
under
which
the
coverage
under
the
act
would
depend
on
whether
the
employee
was
subject
at
any
point
during
the
day
that
he
was
injured
to
being
assigned
onboard
a
vessel.
now,
there
are
number
of
problems
with
this
test.
and
the
first
and
most
fundamental
problem
is
that
it
fails
to
take
account
of
the
basic
purpose
of
the
1972
act
which
was
to
move
the
jensen
line
inward,
to
move
it
away
from
the
gang
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
certainly,
except
that
before
1972
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
certainly
is.
the
problem
though
with
petitioner's
test
i
think
it
--
is
that
it
reinstate
situs,
a
situs
test
into
the
status
definition
by
virtue
of
going
back
to
the
situs
question
of
maritime
employment
which
depended
on
its
being
as
petitioners
read
it
over
the
water
and
saying
that
that's
necessary
to
get
the
status
that
you
have
to
have
the
subject
to
being
assigned
onto
a
maritime
situs
in
order
to
have
a
maritime
employment
status.
i
think
that's
exactly
the
problem
with
petitioner's
test.
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly,
as
in
the
case
of
a
shipbuilder
for
instance.
or
as
in
--
to
take
an
example,
there
are
many
instances
in
which
somebody
maybe
a
dockworker
who
is
not
subject
to
assignment
on
the
ship
but
he
is
engaged
integrally
in
the
unloading
and
loading
process.
for
instance,
to
take
mr.
blundo,
the
checker
in
the
caputo
case,
although
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
the
court
wrote
in
describing
the
facts,
mr.
blundo
was
subject
to
be
going
on
a
ship
in
certain
cases.
he
could
very
well
not
have
been.
he
could
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
but
the
court
did
not
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
court
did
not
in
discussing
mr.
blundo's
status
and
why
he
was
in
--
was
--
had
a
status
that
was
a
maritime
status,
they
did
not
--
the
court
did
not
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
was
subject
to
assignment
on
the
ship.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it's
in
the
facts,
that's
true.
the
problem
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
and
maritime
employment
includes
each
of
the
various
named
categories
and
others,
miscellaneous
categories
that
may
appear.
but
in
that
it
covers
each
of
those
named
categories
that
it
covers
such
people
as
shipbuilders
who
in
many
instances
as
i
say
may
not
be
subject
to
being
assigned
on
a
vessel
and
it
also
covers
the
dockworker
who
may
be
involved
in
an
integral
part
of
the
unloading
process.
for
instance,
suppose
i'm
a
dockworker
standing
right
on
the
dock,
taking
cargo
directly
from
the
ship.
i
simply
happened
not
to
be
subject
to
assignment
to
the
ship,
to
work
onboard
a
ship,
i
would
clearly
be
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
even
though
i
was
not
subject
to
being
assigned
on
a
ship.
now,
i
would
be
covered
under
the
new
act.
i
would
have
a
maritime
status
because
i
was
engaged
in
longshoring
operations,
i
would
have
the
maritime
situs
because
i
would
be
involved
in
--
i
would
be
working
over
navigable
waters
but
i
would
not
be
included
in
petitioner's
test
because
i
would
be
--
not
subject
to
assignment
on
the
vessel
not
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
this
case.
that's
right
and
in
our
view
and
in
the
view
of
the
board
and
the
director
have
taken,
it
is
--
you
can't
distinguish
between
the
case
in
which
the
cargo
moves
steadily
from
the
ship
to
land
transportation
and
the
case
in
which
the
cargo
is
taken
out
of
the
ship,
laid
down
at
the
point
of
rest
and
then
allowed
to
sit
there
for
a
day
or
so
and
then
picked
up
then
and
moved
on
to
a
land
transportation.
in
that
case,
the
board
is
determined
that
there
just
is
no
way
to
determine
how
long
it
has
to
sit
there
whether
if
--
if
it
sits
there
and
is
picked
up
by
somebody
who
works
in
a
different
crew,
that
person
should
not
be
covered.
now,
the
court
rejected
that
point
of
rest
test
in
caputo
and
the
same
considerations
suggests
rejecting
the
petitioner's
test
in
this
case
which
would
depend
on
this
business
of
assignment
on
a
vessel
on
the
day
of
injury.
suppose
for
instance
a
vessel
was
not
in
port
on
the
particular
day
of
injury,
it's
not
clear
that
petitioner's
test
would
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right
but
we
suggest
that
that
would
not
make
good
sense
in
applying
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
certainly
true
and
our
suggestion
is
that
particularly
in
light
of
the
doctrine
that
this
statute
should
be
given
an
expansive
construction
in
favor
of
the
injury
claimant
that
a
narrow
construction
of
the
statute
which
would
exclude
claimants
who
were
injured
on
the
dock
moving
cargo
clearly
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
for
instances
suppose
unloading
a
container,
the
fact
that
they
were
injured
on
a
day
when
the
ship
was
not
in
port
should
not
determine
their
coverage.
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right.
i
think,
i
would
hesitate
to
say
it
because
it
may
well
be
that
the
terminal
would
large
enough
that
you
will
actually
be
driving
a
dolly
or
some
mechanized
vehicle,
a
forklift
is
a
kind
of
truck
i
suppose
and
he
may
well
be
moving
a
truck
or
you
may
well
be
using
a
very
large
forklift
that
looks
a
lot
like
a
truck.
typically,
we
would
say
of
course
that
would
be
longshoring
operations
but
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
caputo
was
busy
loading
a
truck.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right
and
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
caputo
was
covered
but
the
truck
driver
who
was
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
was
not,
who
was
busy
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
the
trucks
were
being
loaded
directly
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
you
have
a
--
i
mean,
certainly
a
truck
driver
could
be
employed
in
a
marine
terminal
to
move
cargo
from
the
vessel,
the
side
of
the
vessel
all
the
way
to
the
railroad
spur
and
he
would
be
covered
even
though
typically
be
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right
forklift
drivers
often
do
just
that.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right,
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
would
certainly
suggest
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
that
he
would
be
covered,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh
no,
because
they
would
say
that
he
is
not
subject
to
go
in
on
a
vessel.
now,
of
course
if
he
were
subject
to
go
in
on
a
vessel
by
his
union
contract,
if
for
instance,
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
he
could
to
drive
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
to
being
assigned
that
day.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
he
could
drive
his
truck
onto
a
vessel.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
he
would
be
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
--
that's
my
understanding
of
the
petitioner's
test
because
that
would
be
an
assignment
onto
the
ship
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
a
possibility
and
that
may
be
how
this
will
all
be
resolved.
thank
you.
