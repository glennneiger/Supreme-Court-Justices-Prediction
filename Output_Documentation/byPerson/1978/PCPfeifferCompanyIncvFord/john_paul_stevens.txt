justice
john
paul
stevens
he
in
fact
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
hypothesis
is
that
land
transportation
always
commences
right
on
the
edge
of
the
terminal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
couldn't
he
not
--
sometimes
commenced
within,
sometimes
on
the
edge
and
sometimes
without.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
get
different
results
in
those
three
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
even
if
the
land
transportation
commences
five
miles
outside
the
terminal,
if
the
truck
driver
regularly
goes
within
the
terminal,
he's
covered.
that's
what
i
understand
you
to
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
are
three
cases.
now,
i
want
your
answer
on
all
three,
one,
where
the
land
transportation
commences
within,
another
right
on
the
edge
and
third
where
it
begins
without
the
term.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'll
get
different
results
in
the
three?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
always
picks
it
up
within,
he's
unloading.
he
always
picks
it
up
within,
that's
the
place
of
where
the
land
transportation
commences.
now,
is
it
--
does
it
matter
whether
it's
just
outside
the
terminal
and
if
it
is
just
outside
the
terminal,
six
inches,
is
that
the
same
case
as
if
it's
ten
miles
outside
the
terminal?
do
you
have
a
clearly
defined
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
put
some
cotton
in
the
warehouse.
you
take
it
from
the
warehouse
on
some
kind
of
--
in
some
kind
of
a
truck
to
a
railroad.
and
the
railroad
spur
truck
in
which
is
loaded
are
three
different
examples.
one,
the
spur
truck
comes
onto
the
pier
or
wherever
it
is,
secondly
its
right
at
the
border,
thirdly
its
outside.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
none
would
be
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
not
a
railroad
employee.
he's
an
employee
of
an
employer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
our
hypothesis
all
the
way
through,
an
employer
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
who
has
some
employees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
countervails
from
a
warehouse
to
a
railroad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
was
talking
about
unloading.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
i'm
just
talking
about
unloading,
going
away
from
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
from
the
ship
to
the
land
transportation.
and
he's
a
truck
driver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
he's
never
covered
because
he's
a
truck
driver,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
it's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
every
example
i
give
you
is
from
a
warehouse
within
the
terminal
to
a
railroad
which
is
going
to
ship
it
to
new
york
or
some
place
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
across
the
country.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
three
different
examples
are
one,
where
the
railroad
has
the
spur
on
the
terminal,
secondly
right
at
the
edge
and
thirdly
outside.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
asking
us
to
draw
a
good
hard
fast
line
and
have
you
got
that
line
firmly
in
mind,
that's
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
are
you
saying
that
his
entire
employment
must
be
on
the
situs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
point,
the
--
mr.
bryson
in
the
caputo,
reading
from
page
253
of
the
opinion,
the
container
blundo
was
checking,
had
been
taken
off
a
vessels
at
another
pier
facility
outside
of
brooklyn
and
brought
overland
unopened
by
an
independent
trucking
company
to
the
21st
street
pier.
the
question
that
raises
my
mind
is
the
truck
driver
who
hold
that
container
from
one
pier
to
another
is
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
again,
assuming
he
was
employed
by
an
employer,
would
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
moving
from
one
maritime
terminal
to
another,
it
isn't
very
different
for
moving
from
one
maritime
terminal
to
a
railroad
station
five
miles
away
and
i'm
sure
that
happens
fairly
often.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
could
i
ask
one
other
question?
no
one
argues
this
but
is
it
conceivable
that
the
status
test
should
be
answered
by
some
kind
of
a
consideration
of
the
character,
the
work
the
man
is
doing?
and
others
could,
one
for
example
say
that
truck
driving
is
not
typical
longshoring
work
and
an
--
a
truck
driver
would
never
be
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
earlier,
when
we
were
talking
before,
you
assumed
the
truck
driver
would
be
performing
the
kind
of
work
that
would
normally
be
covered
if
it
was
at
the
right
place
in
the
chain
of
movement
of
good.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
did
none
of
the
actual
physical
loading
of
the
truck
himself,
all
he
did
was
sit
behind
the
wheel
and
drive
back
and
forth,
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
forklift
truck
is
a
little
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
that's
a
little
more
like
what
typical
longshoreman
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
talking
about
a
driver
of
a,
you
know,
a
teamster.
would
he
--
he
is
--
it's
clear,
everybody
agrees
he's
covered
if
it's
done
in
the
right
place
and
at
the
right
chain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it
woud
be
covered
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
had
to
go
on
the
ship
to
have
the
captain
sign
the
bill
of
lading
or
whatever
it
might
be.
