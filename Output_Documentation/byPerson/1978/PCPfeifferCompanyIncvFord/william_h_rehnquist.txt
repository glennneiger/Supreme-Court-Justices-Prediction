mr.
bryson,
are
those
two
separate
entities
or
one
entity
for
purposes
of
appellate
review,
the
director
and
the
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
--
where
is
the
director
authorized
to
be
a
party
in
these
proceedings?
as
i
read
section
921
(c)
application
can
be
held
at
the
court
of
appeals
to
set
aside
an
award
of
the
benefits
review
board
and
copies
are
to
be
served
on
the
board
and
other
parties.
i
--
i
can
certainly
see
why
the
board
would
be
a
party.
why
is
the
director
a
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
whom?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
wouldn't
the
board
nonetheless
be
the
party
all
--
albeit
defended
by
attorneys
assigned
by
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
feel
that's
immaterial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
internal
inconsistency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
think
he
--
you're
--
justice
stevens
is
asking
you
about
just
taking
the
stuff
away,
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
do
you
say
that
you
can
have
maritime
employment
without
ever
being
subject
to
assignment
and
employment
as
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
outer
limit
then
of
this
employment
test
is
maritime
employment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
someone
who
was
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment
couldn't
qualify?
