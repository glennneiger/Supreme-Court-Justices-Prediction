mr.
e.
d.
vickery
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
combined
for
purposes
of
this
hearing
bring
to
the
court
for
a
resolution,
that
question
which
it
did
not
have
to
reach
in
a
decision
in
1977
and
what
had
commonly
been
come
to
known
--
to
be
known
among
the
bar
as
the
caputo
case.
in
the
caputo
case,
the
court
held
that
an
amphibious
worker
who
is
subject
to
being
assigned
to
work
both
on
the
dock
and
on
the
navigable
area
--
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
was
a
type
of
worker
that
congress
intended
to
cover
in
order
to
provide
a
uniform
compensation
system
for
him
in
the
1972
amendments
to
the
act.
caputo
was
such
an
amphibious
worker
being
subject
to
assignment
either
on
the
dock
or
on
the
vessel
on
the
navigable
waters
in
the
course
of
his
employment
on
the
date
of
his
accident.
petitioners
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
this
navigable
water
standard
on
which
the
court
turned
in
its
caputo
opinion.
it
is
founded
on
historical
decisions
of
this
court,
stemming
back
to
the
famous
case
of
southern
pacific
versus
jensen.
counsel
in
this
case
had
drawn
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
two
positions
very
clearly.
simply
speaking
in
extending
the
act's
jurisdiction
to
show
in
1972
and
congress
intend
to
provide
a
uniform
compensation
system
for
amphibious
workers
who
were
covered
prior
to
1972
for
only
a
part
of
their
work
activity,
that
part
which
was
done
on
navigable
waters,
as
we
respectfully
submit,
that
is
all
that
congress
contended.
or
did
congress
contend
--
intend
as
a
federal
respondent
asserts
to
cover
all
waterfront
workers
who
work
on
piers,
wharf,
terminals
and
other
areas
adjoining
navigable
waters.
before
this
court
in
caputo,
the
federal
respondent
contended
that
it
reach
only
those
waterfront
workers
who
were
directly
involved
in
the
loading
or
unloading
of
land
transportation.
that
was
their
position
in
reply
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
in
their
reply
brief
here,
they
had
expanded
this
to
include
all
waterfront
workers
who
may
be
injured
on
piers,
wharves
or
other
terminal
areas
that
meet
the
situs
test
of
the
1972
amendments.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
situs
is
not
at
issue,
bryant,
the
cotton
header
was
injured
in
a
warehouse
and
the
vessel
would
moor
outside
at
the
pier
alongside
this
warehouse
and
diversion
ford
was
injured
on
railroad
tracks,
it
ran
out
onto
the
pier
in
the
port
of
beaumont
navigation
district,
so
situs
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it
does
exist
in
this
case.
there's
no
question
of
situs.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
question
of
status.
situs
exist
only
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
respondent
now
contends
that
situs
only
is
enough
to
also
satisfy
the
status
test.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
but
other
than
that,
situs
is
not
involved.
oddly
enough
we're
not
too
far
apart
insofar
as
the
factual
situations
existing
in
these
three
cases
either.
there's
not
much
of
a
dispute
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
but
there
are
very
distinct
differences
in
the
types
of
employment
that
these
men
were
engaged
in.
first
of
all,
this
court
recognized
that
caputo
was
a
regular
longshoreman
or
a
longshoreman
by
occupation.
that
is,
he
spent
a
substantial
part
of
his
working
time
in
the
actual
loading
or
unloading
of
vessels.
neither
ford
nor
bryant
spent
any
substantial
period
of
time
in
loading
or
unloading
vessels.
in
fact,
bryant
had
not
engaged
in
the
loading
or
unloading
of
cargo
from
a
vessel
for
approximately
five
or
six
years
prior
to
the
day
of
his
accident.
ford
had
participated
in
the
loading
and
unloading
of
vessels
in
the
port
of
beaumont
on
only
seven
days
during
the
year
immediately
prior
to
his
injury.
ford
was
not
a
longshoreman
by
occupation.
he
would
be
more
aptly
described
as
a
laborer.
he
worked
approximately
seven
days
as
a
longshoreman
during
the
year
prior
to
his
injury.
he
worked
approximately
35
or
36
days
as
a
warehouseman
doing
the
type
of
work
he
was
doing
here,
loading
or
unloading
land
transportation.
the
rest
of
the
time
we
don't
have
specific
dates
but
during
the
rest
of
the
time
he
also
did
construction
work
in
the
beaumont
area
and
he
also
drove
a
beer
truck
for
a
beer
distributor.
so
there
is
no
way
to
classify
either
of
the
two
men
involved
in
this
case
as
being
longshoreman
or
as
having
engaged
in
loading
or
unloading
of
vessels
prior
to
their
injury
of
enough
significance
to
make
them
longshoreman
by
occupation.
in
fact,
ayers
steamship
company
for
whom
bryant
works
has
no
stevedoring
operations
at
all.
it
never
loads
or
unloads
a
vessel.
it
is
a
steamship
agent
who
assembles
cargo
for
the
vessels
that
it
represents
in
the
warehouses.
it
uses
warehouse
workers
like
bryant
to
unload
the
land
transportation,
to
load
--
to
stow
the
cargo
in
the
warehouse
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
vessel.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
union
contract
provides
that
that
is
deep
sea
long
shore
work.
ayers
has
never
stuffed
or
stripped
the
container.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
i
think
the
statute
requires
him
to
be
both
a
longshoreman
and
at
the
time
of
his
injury
to
be
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
for
example
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
but
if
he
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
but
let
me
give
you
an
illustration
of
why
i
think
you
have
to
consider
something
other
than
longshoreman
as
an
occupation.
if
caputo
had
been
moonlighting
on
the
date
of
his
accident
and
have
been
driving
the
truck,
he
would
not
have
been
subject
to
being
assigned
to
work
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
he
would've
been
a
longshoreman
by
occupation.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
in
my
submission,
the
test
is
the
traditional
definition
of
maritime
and
along
what
this
court
has
given
it.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
a
longshoreman
is
a
man
who
loads
and
unloads
vessels.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
he
is
directly
involved
in
the
loading
or
unloading
of
a
vessel,
then
he
could
be
properly
denominated
to
be
a
longshoreman.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
the
interchange
of
the
laborers
between
the
warehouseman
and
the
actual
loading
of
the
vessels
is
something
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
sir?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
think
if
he's
involved
in
a
loading
or
the
unloading
of
the
vessel,
congress
intended
to
cover
him
because
i
think
he
is
subject
to
being
assigned
to
work
either
on
the
dock
or
on
the
vessel
and
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
--
he
becomes
an
amphibious
worker.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
alright.
the
statutory
meaning
of
a
longshoreman
is
a
person
who
engages
in
the
loading
or
the
unloading
of
a
vessel.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
why
did
they
have
to
add
that?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
it
--
there
are
other
people
who
engage
in
longshoring
operations
beside
a
longshoreman.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
alright.
but
the
--
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
say
mr.
justice
stewart
is
reflected
by
what
it
said
with
respect
to
checkers.
checkers
are
directly
involved
in
long
--
in
the
loading
or
unloading
of
the
vessels,
are
subject
to
being
assigned
to
work
either
on
the
vessel
or
on
the
dock
and
congress
was
specifically
referring
to
that.
it
needed
the
other
persons
involved
in
longshoring
operations
to
identify
people
like
the
checkers,
to
also
identify
shoreside
crane
operators
who
are
not
longshoreman
but
they
are
leased
by
the
terminal
facilities,
the
terminal
owners,
leased
cranes
to
be
used
in
the
loading
and
discharging
of
the
vessels
with
an
operator.
they
are
not
longshoreman
by
occupation
or
they
are
not
longshoremen
working
regularly
in
the
loading
or
unloading
of
vessels.
i
think
that
that
is
in
referring
to
it
as
an
occupation,
i
think
you're
dealing
with
a
man
who
spends
substantially
all
of
his
working
time
working
as
a
longshoreman
in
the
loading
or
the
unloading
of
vessels.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
why
you
need
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
why
you
need
the
maritime
employment.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
and
what
i'm
trying
to
say
to
you
is
and
--
because
he
is
a
longshoreman
today,
if
he
--
he
has
to
be
engaged
in
maritime
employment
tomorrow
just
like
he
does
today
when
he's
working
as
a
longshoreman.
the
fact
that
he
may
be
a
longshoreman
by
occupation
as
i
am
an
attorney
by
occupation
but
if
i
drive
a
taxi
cab
tomorrow,
that
wouldn't
give
me
any
benefits
as
an
attorney.
if
he
is
driving
a
taxicab
down
to
the
dock
tomorrow
to
pick
up
people
in
his
moonlighting
job
even
though
he
is
a
longshoreman
by
occupation,
he
is
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment
and
even
though
he
is
injured
on
an
adjoining
area,
he
would
not
be
covered
simply
because
he
is
a
longshoreman
by
occupation
when
he
is
engaged
in
at
particular
occupation.
i
submit
that
that's
the
importance,
it's
the
reason
i
don't
think
that
you
can
look
at
the
terminology
longshoreman
and
the
statute
in
isolation.
the
powell
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
is
another
good
example
of
the
situation
if
you
consider
the
problems
that
were
arise
if
you
consider
the
longshoreman
by
occupation
as
being
the
sole
test.
in
powell,
this
man
had
been
a
longshoreman
for
a
good
many
years
until
about
seven
months
prior
to
his
accident.
he
then
quit
working
as
a
longshoreman
and
started
working
for
the
grain
elevator
unloading
railroad
cars
of
grain
into
the
grain
elevator.
as
such
an
employee,
he
could
never
be
involved
in
the
work
of
a
longshoreman
which
was
done
by
independent
contracting
stevedores
in
the
loading
and
the
unloading
of
a
vessel.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
he
was
no
longer
a
longshoreman.
that
he
had
converted
his
job
and
he
was
now
strictly
an
unloader
of
rail
cars
at
the
grain
elevator.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
so
he
was
not
covered
by
the
statute.
and
the
problem
of
looking
at
longshoreman
by
occupation,
ford
poses
the
question,
is
he
a
longshoreman
by
occupation
because
he
works
seven
days,
if
not
seven
days,
how
many
months,
how
many
weeks
to
make
him
a
longshoreman
by
occupation,
to
make
him
automatically
covered
regardless
of
what
job
he'd
done.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
if
you're
going
to
use
just
the
word
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
right.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
he's
a
longshoreman.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
mr.
--
that's
--
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
he
is
not
covered.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
because
he
is
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
he's
not
engaged
in
longshoring
operation.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
alright.
then
what
you
have
there,
what
you
have
to
look
at
there
is
the
congressional
intent
to
cover
or
to
provide
a
uniform
compensation
system.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
maritime
employment
test.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
all
have
to
meet
maritime
employment
test.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
right.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
do
not
think
he
would
covered
because
he
would
not
meet
the
maritime
employment
status
test.
the
maritime
employment
test
is
whether
or
not
a
person
who's
subject
to
being
assigned
to
work
on
board
a
vessel
and
on
the
dock
because
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
he
is
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
at
that
time.
i
would
have
to
say
that
he
is
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
at
that
time.
but
it
is
not
enough
unless
he
also
meets
the
maritime
employment
test
and
a
maritime
employment
test
that
this
court
has
enunciated
since
southern
pacific
versus
jensen
is
only
that
work
which
is
done
on
navigable
waters.
that's
where
the
dividing
line
between
maritime
employment
and
non-maritime
employment
has
been
drawn
by
this
court
repeatedly.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no,
sir.
that's
what
congress
said.
congress
said
that
we
want
to
cover
this
man
who
--
prior
to
the
1972
amendments
was
covered
only
for
the
work
that
he
did
on
the
ship.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
prior
to
the
1972
amendments,
men
who
are
engaged
in
maritime
employment
as
this
court
have
repeatedly
defined
it
were
subject
to
having
a
compensation
remedy
determined
as
congress
said.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
there
is
no
situs
problem
involved
in
your
example
mr.
justice
white
but
in
determining
maritime
employment
where
the
person
is
working
is
determinative
to
that
issue.
that's
what
started
the
whole
thing
in
1917
when
southern
pacific
versus
jensen
held
maritime
employment
is
on
the
vessel
only
and
the
state
compact
can
apply.
in
northern
hope,
they
reaffirmed
that.
they
said
handling
cargo
on
the
dock
is
not
maritime
employment.
in
1922
--
in
1927
congress
sought
to
solve
the
problem
by
passing
the
longshoremen's
act
and
they
put
in
a
maritime
employment
requirement.
this
court
considered
a
question
of
what
is
maritime
employment
under
the
longshoremen's
act
nogueira
in
1930
and
they
expressly
held,
maritime
employment
was
worked
performed
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
that
was
reaffirmed
in
o'rourke
versus
pennsylvania
railway
company
in
1953.
it
was
a
basis
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
1971
in
the
erie
lackawanna
case
and
again
in
19
--
in
the
cooper
stevedoring
against
fritz
kopke
case.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
right.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
right
because
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
because
--
because
he
was
working
on
navigable
waters
is
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
this
is
what
made
him
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
even
though
he
was
a
railroad
brakeman.
that's
what
made
the
railroad
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
the
only
person
who
had
to
have
any
stat
--
status
prior
to
the
1972
amendments
was
the
employer
and
the
employer
had
to
meet
the
maritime
employment
test
by
showing
that
it
had
employees
who
worked
on
navigable
waters.
it
--
o'rourke
himself
would
have
satisfied
that
but
the
court
held
that
the
railroad
had
other
employees
who
worked
on
navigable
waters,
therefore
the
railroad
was
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
was
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
alright
and
that
required
maritime
employment.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
and
that's
what
i'm
saying
that's
where
the
court
got
the
definition
of
maritime
employment
from
the
employer
definition.
congress
used
precisely
the
same
words
in
the
1972
amendment
and
now
requires
that
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
meet
the
maritime
employment
status
test.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it
was
a
five
to
four
--
i'm
sorry
i
don't
recall
who
wrote
it.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
but
it
was
a
five
to
four
decision.
that's
correct.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
unless
there
are
further
questions.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
thank
you.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
things
that
i
particularly
need
to
say
to
the
court.
please
look
at
the
last
two
sentences
of
the
legislative
history.
they
absolutely
and
categorically
confirmed
this
court's
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
alright.
they
absolutely
confirmed
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
--
this
court's
definition
of
maritime
employment
as
being
used
in
connection
with
the
1972
amendments.
they
state
categorically
that
an
employer
who
does
not
have
any
employees
who
works
on
navigable
waters
is
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
there
are
many
companies
around
the
country
that
do
nothing
but
warehouse
work
and
they
don't
have
a
single
employee
whoever
goes
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
they
do
exactly
the
same
type
of
work
that
the
ford
was
doing,
exactly
the
same
type
of
work
that
bryant
was
doing
but
they
have
not
a
single
employee
who
does
any
work
on
navigable
waters.
congress
states
categorically
that
they
are
not
covered
employers
under
those
circumstances.
if
those
people
working
on
the
dock
who
have
no
other
employees
employed
by
their
employer
cannot
be
involved
in
maritime
employment
either.
this
is
the
bootstrap
operation
that
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
sir?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
this
court
has
held
many
times
the
dock
is
an
extension
of
the
land
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
--
and
has
nothing
to
do
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
sorry?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
because
of
the
--
because
it's
well
settled
in
the
law
that
a
dock
is
the
extension
of
the
land
whether
there
is
water
underneath
the
dock
or
a
land
underneath
the
dock
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
see.
i
believe
that
in
ford's
case,
there
was
no
water
under
the
area
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
--
involved
in
bryant's
case,
most
of
the
piers
and
warehouses
in
galveston
are
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
oh,
the
water,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
misunderstood
your
question.
now,
the
second
thing
that
i
need
to
say
to
the
court
and
i
respectfully
request
that
you
carefully
consider
is
whether
as
federal
respondent
contends
congress
intended
to
move
the
jensen
line
up
to
the
edge
of
the
terminal
or
whether
congress
simply
intended
to
provide
a
uniform
compensation
system
for
those
workers
who
prior
to
the
1972
amendments
had
to
cross
the
jensen
line
and
that's
all
congress
did.
it
says,
the
intent
is
to
provide
a
uniform
system
to
apply
to
employees
who
otherwise
be
covered
by
this
act
for
part
of
their
activity
that
jensen
line
is
what
split
their
workman's
compensation
remedy.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
believe
that
same
maritime
employment
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
same
maritime
employment
requirement
exists
there.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
what
congress
says.
i
believe
that's
what
they
say.
i
believe
the
only
possibility
of
their
being
a
variation
in
this
and
i've
had
no
shipbuilder
in
cases
and
i'm
sorry,
i'm
uninformed
on
it.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
but
the
secretary
of
labor
had
defined
all
of
these
terms
that
are
used
in
the
act
in
connection
with
the
safety
and
health
regulations
for
longshoring
and
ship
repairers,
shipbreakers
and
shipbuilders.
those
were
published
in
1960
and
the
secretary
of
labor's
definition
of
longshoring
operations
in
connection
with
the
safety
and
health
program
which
he
has
operated
since
1960
is
so
different
from
the
proposed
longshoring
operations
test
that
the
federal
respondents
submits
to
this
court,
that
is
ludicrous.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
right.
i
understand.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
right.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
and
that
is
correct.
that
is
not
maritime
employment
within
the
meaning
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
--
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
believe
the
estimate
given
in
the
senate
hearings
at
about
65
to
70%
of
the
work
on
a
shipyard
was
on
navigable
waters.
then
those
workers
who
were
involved
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that
there
would
be
about
35
that
would
be
not.
so
a
shipbuilder
who
builds
it
entirely
on
land,
who
builds
a
vessel
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
right.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
he
is
not
engaged
in
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
he
is
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
there
are
shipbuilders
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
your
honor,
there
are
shipbuilders
who
build
tugs,
barges
and
things
like
that
entirely
on
land
taken
by
trailer
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
--
and
then
launch
them.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
and
in
my
opinion
those
people
are
not
engaged
in
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
consider
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
they
can
be
built
entirely
on
land.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
