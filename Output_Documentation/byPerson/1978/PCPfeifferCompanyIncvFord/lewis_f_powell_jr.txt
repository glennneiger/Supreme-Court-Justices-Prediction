justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
question
presented
is
whether
two
workers
when
they
sustain
injuries
who
are
engaged
in
maritime
activity
as
defined
in
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
when
respondent
ford
was
injured,
he
was
working
on
a
public
dock,
fastening
military
vehicles
onto
a
railroad
car
for
inland
transportation.
respondent
bryant
was
hurt
while
unloading
cotton
from
a
dray
wagon
into
a
pier
warehouse.
the
cotton
later
was
moved
from
the
warehouse
and
placed
onboard
a
ship.
the
act
as
reenacted
in
1972
established
a
dual
test
for
eligibility
for
benefits.
first,
a
worker
must
be
injured
upon
the
situs
as
defined
in
section
3
(a)
of
the
act.
that
situs
includes
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
adjoining
piers,
wharves
and
other
areas
customarily
used
for
loading
or
unloading
a
vessel.
it
is
undisputed
that
both
ford
and
bryant
satisfy
the
situs
requirement.
second,
a
worker
must
be
a
covered
employee
under
section
2
(3)
of
the
act.
this
requires
that
the
employee
be
engaged
in
maritime
employment
when
injured,
the
question
presented
by
this
case.
the
arguments
advanced
pro
and
con
on
this
issue
need
not
be
stated
in
this
brief
oral
summary.
suffice
it
to
say
we
are
satisfied
that
ford
and
bryant
were
in
engaged
in
maritime
employment,
their
work
involved
intermediate
steps
in
the
moving
of
cargo
between
ship
and
land
transportation.
our
decision
today
serves
the
congressional
goal
of
providing
a
uniform
standard
of
coverage.
we
believe
our
standard
will
enable
both
workers
and
employers
to
predict
with
reasonable
assurance
who
is
covered
by
the
1972
act.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
