justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
he
didnt
died
a
longshoreman
wheeled
something
off
a
ship
and
wheeled
it
right
to
a
truck,
wheeled
it
right
to
a
truck
that
was
going
to
carry
it
away
and
he
was
helped
by
mr.
ford
and
the
truck
driver
to
load
the
truck
and
all
three
got
hurt.
i
suppose
the
truck
driver
wouldn't
be
covered
because
he
isn't
engaged
in
maritime
employment
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
is
it
because
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
isn't
engaged
in
longshoring
operations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
this
piece
of
cargo
came
straight
off
the
ship
and
is
being
loaded
right
on
the
truck.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you'd
say
that
the
driver
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
truck
driver
just
isn't
engaged
in
maritime
employment,
that
excludes
him,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
how
about
in
this
same
accident
at
the
same
moment,
the
longshoreman
would
be
--
clearly
be
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he
is
unloading
the
ship.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
he
is
a
longshoreman.
and
how
about
mr.
ford
there,
he
is
engaged
in
--
he
always
does
this.
he's
on
the
pier.
he's
attached
to
the
--
maybe
he's
hired
by
the
stevedoring
company
but
he
isn't
a
longshoreman.
he
isn't
--
right
then
he
isn't
--
he
hasn't
been
unloading
a
ship,
he
hasn't
been
on
the
ship
but
would
he
be
covered
in
that,
my
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
here
comes
a
piece
of
cargo
off
the
vessel.
it
never
stops,
it
gets
right
to
the
truck,
he
helps
a
longshoreman
put
it
on
the
truck
and
he's
hurt.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
--
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
there
wasn't
any
situs
problem
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
wouldn't
--
why
would
there
have
been
a
situs
problem
in
my
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
a
railroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
--
but
then
the
gang
point
now
is
just
--
extends
to
the
edge
of
the
terminal?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
that's
situs
again.
i
--
i
think
it's
--
don't
you
think
it's
of
any
importance
to
distinguish
between
the
test
of
situs
and
case
--
test
of
status?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
important
not
to
confuse
the
--
confuse
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they're
confusing
enough
statute
as
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
--
but
your
test
could
also
cover
the
worker
who
took
a
cargo
out
of
a
warehouse
on
the
dock
that
have
been
stored
there
for
five
or
six
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
doesn't
agree?
justice
byron
r.
white
steamships
too.
