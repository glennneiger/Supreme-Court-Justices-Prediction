justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
quite
follow
your
argument
but
i
didn't
read
your
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
going
quite
that
far,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
the
word
equal
in
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
anybody
ask
us
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
we
draw
the
line
of
to
be
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
be
bad
if
it
were
done
by
a
state
agency
in
violation
of
equal
protection
clause
something
like
that,
and
that's
sort
of
the
thrust
of
what
they
say
i
think.
