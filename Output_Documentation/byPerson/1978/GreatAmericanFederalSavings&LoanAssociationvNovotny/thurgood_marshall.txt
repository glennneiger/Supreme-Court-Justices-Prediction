we
realize
the
opinions
here
but
we're
passing
on
the
judgments
only.
justice
thurgood
marshall
two?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
it
was
three
or
more
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
i
mean,
it's
not
important
to
me
i
am
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
regardless
that
did
research
on
that
period
that
she
didn't
know
what
was
going
on
when
one
man
will
say
yes
today
and
say
no
tomorrow
and
sometimes
the
same
afternoon.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice

when
you
could
do
it
would
be
to
measure
it
and
putting
it
on
two
sides
and
how
many
times
you
said
yes
and
how
many
times
you
said
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
court
said
so
in
the
brown
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
the
statute
is
certainly
passed
to
enforce
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice

expressly
to
enforce
to
stop
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
nobody
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
that
they
had
any
censorship
before
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
nobody
had
censorship
before
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
at
that
time,
a
woman
would
insist?
at
least
she
couldn't
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
title
vii?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
that
part
(inaudible)
before
title
--
before
the
statute
was
passed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
--
well,
he
couldn't
have
brought
it
before
title
vii
but
it
could
be
viewed
1985
before
title
vii
was
adopted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
you
rely
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'd
say
--
if
they
need
to
be
conspired
they
did
not
mean
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
could
you
say
the
conspiracy
were
to
deny
on
what
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
certainly
1985
didn't
mean
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
certainly,
it
didn't
mean
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
unless,
you
want
to
get
through
all
four
cases
in
100
u.s.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
on
animus,
a
few
years
ago
when
this
court
said
women
were
entitled
to
sit
on
the
jury,
the
court
was
guilty
of
animus?
i
mean,
i
think
the
word
is
a
very
encompassing
word.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
understand
your
meaning
that
you
don't
have
what
you
and
i
think
of
animus
nor
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
right.
