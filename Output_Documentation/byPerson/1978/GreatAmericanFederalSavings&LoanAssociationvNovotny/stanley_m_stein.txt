mr.
stanley
m.
stein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
an
individual
who
after
25
years
of
service
with
the
same
corporation
held
the
position
of
high
responsibility
was
the
second
in
command
in
that
corporation,
had
no
previous
questions
raised
regarding
his
competence
or
his
loyalty.
and
nevertheless
was
fired
on
january
22,
1975
after
having
been
engaged
in
efforts
to
support
claims
and
complaints
made
by
women
employees
of
the
bank
for
which
he
worked
that
they
have
been
discriminated
against
over
a
period
of
time
and
were
continuing
to
be
discriminated
against.
he
supported
them
verbally
in
a
meeting
of
a
board.
he
supported
them
with
his
vote
and
voted
against
actions
taken
by
the
--
all
of
the
other
members
of
the
board
and
he
was
in
a
extreme
minority.
in
his
actions
did
not
side
with
“management”
and
for
that
reason
and
that
reason
alone
we
would
submit
he
was
fired.
he
immediately
filed
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
two
years
later,
a
right
to
sue
letter
was
issued
to
him.
the
longstanding
history
of
inferior
treatment
which
we
would
have
been
prepared
to
prove
had
we
ever
gotten
past
the
motion
to
dismiss
included
women
being
paid
less
for
the
same
work,
receiving
fewer
promotional
opportunities
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes,
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
prove
under
1985
(3)
that
the
discriminatory
actions
on
the
part
of
the
members
of
the
board
were
intentionally
undertaking
for
the
purpose
of
invidiously
discriminating
against
a
group,
a
class
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
no,
not
necessarily,
i
don't
know
that
i
have
to
prove
any
more
than
they
fired
him
because
of
his
particular
advocacy,
i
don't
know
that
they
have
to
have
had
an
actual
discriminatory
animus
against
the
women
who
they
discriminated
against.
and
it
may
be
that
i
might
want
to
prove
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well,
that
their
intention
in
firing
him
was
because
they
had
a
--
they
were
subjectively
opposed
to
women's
rights.
they
subjectively
intended
to
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
against
women.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
don't
think
i
have
to
prove
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
--
title
vii
case
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
the
title
vii
is
the
easier
of
the
two.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
because
i
think
that
this
is
a
particularly
aggravated
situation
and
i
think
under
the
circumstances,
the
individuals
should
be
required
to
be
held
individually
responsible
if
they
can
be.
and
i
think
the
salutary
effect
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
may
or
may
not
be
able
to.
i
have
--
i've
never
had
the
opportunity
actually
to
develop
the
facts,
i
have
filed
here
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well
then
i'm
--
then
i
would
collect
under
title
vii
but
i
would
not
necessarily
collect
the
same
--
to
the
same
extent.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
again
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well,
under
title
--
under
1985
(3),
i
may
and
again
without
saying
that
i
do
because
this
court
has
never
so
indicated.
and
i
would
like
to
really
get
to
the
fact
development
to
determine
and
to
continue
more
with
the
case
but
i
may
have
a
right
to
collect
compensatory
damages
in
the
nature
of
additional
costs
for
searching
for
another
job.
i
may
have
the
right
to
collect
for
the
damages
if
i
can
find
inapplicable
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
think
that
the
1985
(3)
may
provide
greater
remedies
and
at
this
point,
these
questions
have
not
been
decided
by
this
court
and
i
think
that's
somewhere
down
the
road.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
get
to
that
point.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes,
i
would
say
that
that's
the
case
in
this
particular
instance
without
necessarily
conceding
to
the
court
because
i
haven't
fully
gone
into
it
without
necessarily
conceding
that
1985
(3)
didn't
create
any
substantive
rights.
but
i
would
say
that
we
are
asserting
under
1985
(3)
the
statute
passed
by
congress
which
created
the
equality
of
rights
for
women
and
others.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes,
though
i
felt
the
third
circuit
didn't
have
to
go
any
farther
than
it
had
to
go
and
it
didn't
and
i
think
the
third
circuit
just
simply
felt
the
congress
was
well
within
it's
constitutional
powers
to
do
that
if
that's
what
it
wanted
to
do.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
that's
correct.
there
are
certain
matters
which
i
did
not
think
were
in
a
serious
dispute.
i
think
that
women
are
among
persons
who
are
protected
under
the
terms
of
1985
(3)
and
i
think
that
it's
also
clear
that
discrimination
against
women
as
a
class
is
invidious
discrimination.
i
think
that
title
1985
(3)
the
persons
who
suffered
the
discriminatory
animus
and
the
person
who
suffers
the
damage
do
not
necessarily
have
to
be
the
same
person.
and
i
find
nothing
in
1985
(3)
which
would
prohibit
a
man
or
any
other
person
from
asserting
a
right
or
asserting
damage
resulting
from
the
invidious
discrimination
when
he
has
suffered
in
fact
suffered
that
damage.
and
i
would
also
like
to
point
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
1985
(3)
was
used
to
circumvent
title
vii
procedures.
mr.
novotny
immediately
went
to
the
eeoc
and
filed
his
claim
with
the
eeoc
and
permitted
the
eeoc
procedures
to
run
long
beyond
the
point
at
which
he
would
have
a
right
to
have
his
right
to
sue
issue
to
him
if
he
had
requested
it
regardless
of
what
else
happened.
the
argument
that
title
vii
will
be
undermined
by
1985
(3),
i
think
is
an
argument
which
has
been
made
many
times
to
this
court.
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
to
believe
that
title
vii
will
use
the
title
vii
will
undermine
the
provisions
of
--
i
mean
the
use
of
1985
(3)
will
undermine
the
provisions
of
title
vii
in
any
way.
there
are
major
benefits
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
no,
i
do
not.
i
believe
that
he
could
go
to
the
court
if
he
wanted
to
under
1985
(3).
i
do
not
believe
that
very
many
people
will.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
think
those
who
want
who
could,
those
who
want
to
file
1981
actions
in
the
race
case
could.
and
that
particular
--
that
particular
availability
has
not
seemed
to
bother
this
court
in
those
kinds
of
cases
and
this
court
has
faced
that
question
exactly.
and
i
just
don't
think
that
very
many
will
do
so
and
the
1985
(3)
action
is
a
rather
narrow
action
when
you
come
right
down
to
it.
we
are
not
talking
about
floods
of
litigation
which
will
impel
at
this
court.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
eeoc
will
be
put
out
of
business.
despite
the
existence
of
1981
and
other
remedies
the
petitioners
in
their
reply
brief
which
they
recently
filed
indicates
that
nevertheless
almost
6,000
eeoc
cases
were
in
fact
filed
with
the
eeoc
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes.
the
substantive
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
the
substantive
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
would
have
to
wait
180
days
for
my
right
to
sue
at
which
point
i
could
request
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
no,
i
am
asserting
that
i
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
am
indicating
that
i
do
not
have
to
wait
to
file
the
1985
(3)
action
because
i
think
the
1985
(3)
cause
of
action
has
independent
interests
of
its
own.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
no,
not
stated
exactly
that
way.
the
1985
(3)
case
arises
because
of
a
violation
of
title
vii.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
that's
correct.
and
that
in
and
off
itself
is
a
cause
of
action.
it
is
not
necessarily
a
title
vii
cause
of
action
and
it's
a
cause
of
action
all
by
itself
and
i
do
not
have
to
necessarily
wait
because
there
has
been
a
violation
of
a
federal
statute.
i
would
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
proof
has
to
show
that
violation
in
my
case.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
do
not
believe
that
i
have
to
show
the
violation
of
title
vii
to
recover
under
1985
(3).
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
have
to
show
that
the
title
vii
violation
that
occurred
and
against
which
my
client
spoke
out
was
an
intentional
violation.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes,
the
conspiracy
would
be
to
--
the
conspiracy
would
be
against
him.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well,
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
no,
and
not
necessarily
because
the
conspiracy
would
have
to
be
to
deprive
--
the
conspiracy
will
have
to
be
deprived
others
of
rights
which
they
have
on
their
statutes.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
title
vii
rights.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
to
deprive
him
of
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
--
vii
rights.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
no,
but
he
would
not
necessarily
be
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
he
would
not
necessarily
be
suing
on
that
per
se.
if
he
came
in
and
then
spoke
out
but
against
that
and
advised
them
that
they
were
then
doing
that
and
they
knowingly
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
it
may
not
violate
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
no,
because
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well,
but
there
may
be
a
different
purpose
in
their
terminating
his
employment.
and
if
they
are
terminating
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well
it
may
be
and
i
don't
necessarily
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
it
may
and
it
may
not
be
a
purely
remedial
statute
and
i
haven't
conceded
that
it
is
a
purely
remedial
statute
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
pardon
me?
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
i'm
not
sure
that
i
do
because
i
have
a
circumstance
in
this
particular
case
where
i
can
prove
that
the
discrimination
in
this
case
was
intentional.
that
the
discrimination
against
women
was
intentional
in
knowing,
so
under
the
facts
of
this
case
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well,
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
would
indicate
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
that
may
be
true.
i
may
not
have.
well,
if
i
were
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
if
i
were
to
have
brought
the
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well,
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
i
would
--
i
could
argue
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
the
conspiracy
would
be
to
deny
women
rights
which
they
may
have
had
and
this
would
get
into
a
possible
argument
which
i
did
not
want
to
necessarily
press
before
this
court
of
the
extent
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
the
possibility
of
the
creation
of
the
specific
right
to
employment
on
the
part
of
everybody
that
is
the
freedom
from
discrimination
in
employment
on
the
part
of
any
person
whom
--
who
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
no.
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
--
know
what
1985
meant
in
that
regard
and
i'm
not
necessarily
--
because
the
argument
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
right.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well
i
don't
necessarily
say
that
they
didn't
like
women
but
what
i
think
i
do
allege
is
that
they
knowingly
discriminated.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
knowingly
discriminated.
now,
i
think
that
--
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
well,
and
i
think
as
i
responded
to
the
--
i
responded
to
the
court's
question
at
that
time
that
that's
not
the
case
that
i
was
necessarily
pleading
in
the
complaint.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
stein
is
it
also
arguable
if
they
were
not
employers
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
