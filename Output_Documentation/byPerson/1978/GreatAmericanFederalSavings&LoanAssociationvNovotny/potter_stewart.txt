would
you
--
suppose
you
would
have
needed
the
1985
(3)
at
all
in
the
griffin
case
against
breckenridge?
couldn't
the
suits
been
brought
directly
under
the
--
since
it
has
been
brought
directly
asserting
rights
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
the
constitutional
right
to

justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
it's
not
otherwise
assertable.
look
at
the
bivens
case,
for
example.
do
you
--
familiar
with
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
connors,
do
you
take
the
view
or
do
you
believe
that
the
two
sections
which
are
now
1983
and
1985
(3)
protect
the
same
bundle
of
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
now.
justice
potter
stewart
--
where
do
you
say
the
statute
says
that?
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
if
a
native
born
female
would
come
under
the
stat
--
the
constitutional
definition
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
a
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
it's
true,
of
course
that
griffin
versus
breckenridge
did
involve
only
constitutional
rights
to
specific
rights
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
collins
against
hardyman
involve
an
asserted
constitutional
right
(voice

--
justice

right
to
petition?
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
right
of
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
that
was
it.
so
your
submission
is
that
1985
(3)
authorizes
lawsuits
only
to
protect
only
rights
conferred
by
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
not
by
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
not
by
the
respondent
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
he
tells
us
at
the
outset.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
violate
title

and
your
client

justice

was
injured
thereby.
justice

of

it
