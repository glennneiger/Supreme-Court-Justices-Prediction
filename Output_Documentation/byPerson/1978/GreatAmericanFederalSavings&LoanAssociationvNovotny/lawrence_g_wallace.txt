mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
in
this
court
that
eight
years
ago,
this
court
after
a
careful
review
of
the
legislative
history
of
what
is
now
1985
(c)
in
the
latest
edition
of
title
42
restored
that
statute
to
its
proper
role
in
civil
rights
enforcement.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
properly
extended
the
principles
of
the
griffin
decision
in
a
manner
that
is
compatible
with
the
title
vii.
as
we
understand
the
basic
principle
of
griffin
against
breckenridge
it's
that
1985
(c)
serves
as
a
remedy
for
aggravated
cases
of
the
violation
of
other
federal
rights
in
which
aggravated
cases
in
which
a
number
of
individuals
sharing
a
class
based
discriminatory
animus
join
in
scheme
to
deprive
a
person
or
persons
of
their
rights
under
federal
law
and
therefore
denied
him
equal
protection
of
the
federal
law
equal
rights
and
privileges
under
the
laws
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
and
that
is
the
kind
of
claim
as
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
complaint
here
that
was
raised
in
this
case
and
no
question
has
been
put
to
this
court
about
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
the
complaint.
nor
has
any
question
been
raised
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
under
title
vii
in
the
case
thus
far
although
we
noted
on
page
27
of
our
brief
in
footnote
16
that
the
petitioners
have
resolved
the
possibility
of
asserting
a
defense
for
the
individual
directors
under
title
vii
based
on
the
fact
that
they
were
not
named
in
the
original
title
vii
charge
individually.
we
--
we've
stated
our
view
that
that
would
not
be
a
valid
defense
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
statutory
definition
of
employer
in
title
vii
includes
agent
of
the
employer
so
that
any
place
that
the
word
employer
or
the
word
that
the
statutory
definition
of
union
is
the
same
in
title
vii.
so
that
any
place
that
there's
a
liability
of
the
employer
or
the
union
there's
a
liability
of
the
agent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
assume
so,
your
--
mr.
justice
and
we're
not
attempting
to.
i
was
just
mentioning
the
relationship
between
the
title
vii
claim
which
has
not
been
brought
here
but
where
a
defense
still
remains
to
be
asserted
in
the
case.
the
question
had
been
raised
about
why
did
the
petitioners
bring
only
the
1985
claim
here
and
this
is
one
factor
that
was
not
mentioned
in
previous
discussions.
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
reach
some
issues
that
the
court
--
that
this
court
in
griffin
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
reach
in
order
to
decide
the
case
and
a
number
of
those
have
not
been
presented
in
this
court.
there
is
no
claim
made
in
this
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
aired
in
construing
1985
(c)
as
extending
to
class-based
deprivations
other
than
racial
deprivations.
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
that
issue
correctly
in
our
view
but
the
question
as
we
see
it
is
not
before
the
court.
although
what
the
case
does
present
to
the
court
is
the
question
whether
the
kind
of
supplemental
remedy
that
section
1981
provides
under
this
court's
unanimous
decision
in
johnson
against
railway
express
on
this
point.
that
kind
of
supplemental
remedy
in
racial
cases
under
title
vii
will
also
exist
in
sex
discrimination
cases
under
title
vii.
oh,
that's
one
way
of
looking
at
the
question
that's
presented
here
because
1981
addresses
only
racial
discrimination
and
the
other
classes
protected
by
title
vii
have
to
look
to
1985
(c).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
title
vii
is
available
for
the
racial
cases
as
well
as
the
others.
the
only
supplemental
remedy
comparable
to
1981
for
the
other
classes
protected
by
title
vii
is
1985
(c)
and
that
is
the
significance
of
the
case
whether
the
supplemental
remedy
will
be
limited
to
racial
cases
looking
at
the
cases
and
employment
discrimination
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
this
case
it's
against
women.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
but
he
became
a
person
injured
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
for
the
retaliation
which
title
vii
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
protects
him
against.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
we
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
as
we
see
1985
(c)
it
involves
additional
elements
to
a
title
vii
violation
in
the
sense
that
it's
an
aggravated
kind
of
a
title
vii
violation.
it's
not
that
1985
(c)
is
a
separate
substantive
right
against
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
remedy
for
aggravated
violations
of
all
of
rights
to
find
elsewhere.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
has
to
be
a
conspiracy
but
the
conspiracy
must
involve
a
shared
animus,
a
shared
class-based
animus.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything
other
than
to
treat
them
differently
in
the
sense
that
the
focus
is
on
the
class.
it
wouldn't
extend
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
you
see
title
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right,
but
the
title
vii
under
this
court's
decision
in
griggs
extends
to
employment
criteria
where
the
focus
is
not
on
the
protected
class.
griggs
involved
a
high
school
diploma
requirement
for
someone
to
be
hired
to
shovel
coal
at
the
duke
power
company
as
well
as
tests
that
were
given.
and
those
had
a
disparate
effect
at
the
criteria
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
the
criterion
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
not
based
on
the
class.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
would
have
to
be
a
showing
that
there
was
something
more
than
a
desire
to
encourage
people
not
to
dropout
of
high
school
or
you
know
a
hope
that
people
hired
at
the
bottom
would
have
the
ability
to
rise
up
through
the
company.
something
that
did
focus
on
animus
toward
the
protected
class.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
an
equal
impact
would
not
be
enough
under
1985
(c)
but
as
we
understand
it,
it
is
an
enough
under
title
vii.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
perhaps
it
isn't.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
hostility.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
there
has
to
be
a
shared
purpose
to
deprive
members
of
one
of
the
protected
classes
of
their
federal
right
although
it
doesn't
have
to
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
--
it
simply
put
it
that
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
and
that
we
think
is
the
proper
office
of
1985
(3)
of
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii
which
this
court
has
reviewed
in
detail
in
recent
cases
is
quite
specific
that
the
comparable
supplemental
remedy
under
1981
was
to
be
preserved.
and
was
considered
by
those
who
enacted
title
vii
to
be
compatible
with
the
exhaustion
requirements
and
administrative
procedure
that
was
set
up
under
title
vii.
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
federal
statute
with
more
specific
history
that
the
remedies
created
along
with
the
substantive
rights
in
title
vii
were
not
intended
to
be
exclusive
but
were
intended
to
permit
a
supplemental
remedy
that
is
comparable
in
every
way
to
the
remedy
being
asserted
here
under
1985
(c).
it's
difficult
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
a
difference
in
theory
of
the
remedy
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
from
the
standpoint
of
the
legislative
intent
of
the
sponsors
of
title
vii
it
is
apparent
that
they
did
not
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
have
a
remedy
that
was
in
every
way
comparable
still
available
for
persons
protected
against
racial
discrimination
by
title
vii.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
their
view
would
be
different
if
they
had
focused
on
the
question
about
the
other
classes
protected
by
title
vii.
so
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
of
title
vii,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
a
bar
to
alternative
remedies
was
intended.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
certainly
did
at
that
time
not
the
title
vii
remedies
would
be
enforced
but
that
alternative
remedies
would
still
be
available
and
none
would
be
taken
away.
so
that
if
our
construction
of
1985
(c)
is
correct
that
it
extends
to
aggravated
instances
of
class-based
depravations
of
rights
prescribed
by
other
federal
laws
or
the
constitution
then
the
congress
indicated
in
title
vii
no
desire
to
take
away
that
method
of
asserting
a
right
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it
is
the
shared
purpose,
the
conscious
conspiracy
in
the
sense
of
a
shared
purpose
to
treat
women
differently
even
though
federal
law
said
that
they
should
not
be
treated
differently.
it
is
not
more
complex
than
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
perhaps,
few
men
have
been
turned
away.
i
don't
know
that
male
applicants
have
not
received
fair
consideration
certainly
under
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
women
who
aspire
to
this
kind
of
employment
have
the
right
to
be
considered
on
their
merits
for
it
even
if
all
the
rest
of
the
secretaries
are
women.
this
relates
to
previous
argument
of
this
term.
