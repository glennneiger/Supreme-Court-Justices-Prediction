unknown
speaker
yes,
yes,
yes.
and
that
was
a
direct
action
under
the
jurisdictional
--
general
jurisdiction
statute
1331,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
was
a
direct
action
under
a
right
directly
given
protection
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
that
case
is
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
rights
conferred
by
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
and
among
those
rights
is
the
thirteenth
amendment
right
of
negroes
that
have
to
be
treated
differently
from
other
people
and
the
right
of
everybody
to
travel
interstate
without
interference.
now
those
are
two
clearly
established
constitutional
rights.
couldn't
an
action
been
brought
in
the
griffin
case
without
invocation
of
1985
(3).
unknown
speaker
why?
because
neither
one
of
those
involves
or
require
a
state
deprivation.
it's
deprivation
by
anybody.
the
thirteenth
amendment
abolishes
involuntary
servitude
and
it
doesn't
say
that
the
private
people
can
carry
on
involuntary
servitude
after
that
but
only
the
states
are
prohibited
from
doing
it.
and
the
interstate
right
to
trouble
is
a
right
assertable
against
anybody
not
just
against
government.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
--
unknown
speaker
if
you're
arguing
that
the
party
so
injured
language
narrows
the
statute,
i
should
think
you
would
have
argued
that
the
plaintiff
being
male
was
not
a
member
of
the
class
that
was
injured
but
you
didn't
make
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
really
weren't
persuaded
by
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
they
also
weren't
persuaded
by
what
i
want
to
be
mine.
unknown
speaker
mr.
connors,
you
haven't
quite
said
it
or
if
you
have,
i
missed
it.
but
is
it
in
your
position
not
that
in
some
that
1985
(3)
protects
or
authorizes
the
assertion
only
of
constitutional
rights,
not
statutory
rights?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
stein,
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
question?
unknown
speaker
you
have
alternative
theories
in
the
district
court
one
under
title
vii
and
one
other
1985
(3).
unknown
speaker
if
you
prove
the
facts
you're
just
describing
to
us,
you
presume
we
would
recover
under
title
vii,
do
you
need
to
prove
any
less
to
recover
under
1985
(3)?
is
there
any
difference
in
the
evidence
that
has
to
be
presented
by
you
to
recover
under
one
rather
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
proved
that
in
order
to
recover
against
him
for
the
man
under
title
vii?
don't
you
have
to
prove
precisely
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
discriminatory
animus?
unknown
speaker
they
have
to
prove
their
motive
and
sort
of
an
evil
motive
against
women?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
on
the
title
vii
case?
unknown
speaker
the
title
vii
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
--
is
the
easier
of
the
two?
unknown
speaker
then
why
are
you
pursuing
this
one?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
difference
is
you
cannot
hold
the
individuals
responsible
under
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
theory
of
the
case
and
assume
you
proved
everything
you
have
alleged.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
remedy
is
greater
under
title
--
1985
(3)?
unknown
speaker
what
in
the
statute
is
your
greater
remedy?
i
don't
see
much
in
your
--
unknown
speaker
well,
in
a
word,
do
you
think
1985
(3)
provides
a
greater
remedy
than
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
what's
your
--
the
right
that
you're
asserting
in
this
case
when
you
said
third
circuit
that
was
the
title
vii
right?
unknown
speaker
that
you
were
using
and
--
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
we're
only
assuming
on
the
title
vii
would
have
to
wait
for
your
right
to
sue
letter,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
--
you
suggest
that
you
don't
--
in
order
to
enforce
your
title
vii
right
you
don't
need
to
wait
at
all
if
you
just
use
1985
(3)?
unknown
speaker
and
what
statute
--
just
indicated
you
didn't
have
to
wait.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know
but
you
--
but
your
1985
(3)
suit
in
this
case,
i
thought
you
conceded
was
to
enforce
title
--
your
title
vii
right?
unknown
speaker
the
substantive
right
that
you're
using
1985
(3)
to
enforce
is
your
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
mr.
connors
or
mr.
stein
rather,
the
right
--
title
vii
right
that
you
assert
is
it
the
same
right
that
in
1985
(3)
case
is
it
would
be
in
the
title
vii
case.
the
thing
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is,
is
there
a
difference
in
the
intent
requirement
in
the
1985
(3)
case?
and
if
there
is,
does
that
indicate
there
is
a
difference
in
the
substantive
rule
you
seek
to
enforce?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
show
it
under
the
agreement
the
conspiracy
though
that
got
some
mental
element,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
to
violate
title
vii
though.
unknown
speaker
to
deprive
him
of
a
title
vii
right?
unknown
speaker
title
vii,
so,
--
okay.
if
they
have
to
intend
and
--
unknown
speaker
--
deprive
him
of
title
vii
rights.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
still
don't
think
you've
answered
my
question.
i
mean,
we
sure
are
trying
to
get
it
out
as
clearly
as
i
can.
supposing
the
directors
all
agreed
that
their
experiences
that
women
are
not
as
effective
workers
as
men
and
maybe
they're
wrong
and
they
have
scary
type
views.
but
they
just
think
women
shouldn't
be
paid
as
much
so
they
pay
him
10%
less.
but
they
do
it
in
good
faith
because
they
think
they're
not
good
employees.
is
that
a
violation
of
title
vii?
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
violation
of
1985
(3)?
unknown
speaker
why
not
then?
unknown
speaker
when
they
say
--
we
think
this
is
in
the
interest
of
the
company,
it
will
save
us
money
and
women
are
(inaudible);
that
violates
1985
--
unknown
speaker
--
title
vii
but
does
not
violate
1985
(3)?
unknown
speaker
but
that
you
are
relying
on
a
different
substantive
right
then?
unknown
speaker
there's
an
additional
ingredient
of
the
violation
if
i
understand
you
correctly
in
1985
(3)?
unknown
speaker
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
do
you
not
have
to
prove
something
additional
to
establish
a
violation
of
1985
(3)
and
if
you
say
yes,
then
what's
the
source
of
that
right?
it
must
be
in
the
statute
itself.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
the
position
in
1985
(3)
is
not
purely
a
remedial
statute?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
but
must
you
not
argue
that
it
is
not?
unknown
speaker
must
you
not
be
arguing
that
it
is
more
than
a
remedial
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
(voice
overlap)
not
because
they
didn't
like
women?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stein
as
i
read
your
complaint,
all
you've
alleged
is
that
they
treated
the
women
differently
than
they
treated
the
men.
you
don't
allege
that
they
didn't
like
women.
unknown
speaker
treated
women
--
unknown
speaker
that's
the
first
case
i
gave
you.
they
paid
them
less
deliberately
because
they
thought
they
weren't
as
good
and
it
turns
out
they're
wrong.
i
don't
think
you
have
alleged
to
know
other
than
an
intent
to
treat
them
differently.
unknown
speaker
what
does
--
what
kind
of
a
class-based
discrimination
must
be
alleged
do
you
think
mr.
wallace?
in
this
case
it's
against
women?
unknown
speaker
and
under
that
resulted
in
some
injury
to
this
employee?
unknown
speaker
and
the
--
unknown
speaker
what
protection
--
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
my
brother
stevens'
question.
does
it
--
do
you
have
to
allege
something
besides
just
treating
women
as
a
class
differently?
they
--
the
intention
--
you
must
say
they
have
the
purpose
of
treating
them
differently
intentionally
treating
them
differently.
unknown
speaker
intentionally
treating
them
differently.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
--
unknown
speaker
aggravated
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
its
animus.
(voice
overlap)
animus,
anything
other
than
they
treat
them
differently?
unknown
speaker
for
example,
take
the
manhart
case
which
i'm
sure
you're
familiar
with.
would
that
--
would
the
action
of
the
directors
there
to
adopt
different
pay,
the
contributions
for
women
and
men,
would
that
violate
1981?
unknown
speaker
now,
would
if
you
have
a
pay
scale,
the
women
get
10%
less
than
men
even
though
you
think
they're
10%
less
efficient
and
prove
that
later
you're
wrong.
unknown
speaker
you
violate
1985
(3),
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
hold
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
--
1985
--
unknown
speaker
--
(3)
that
high
school
diploma
for
shoveling
coal
would
violate
1985
(3),
the
people
--
unknown
speaker
--
who
decided
to
impose
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
(inaudible)
i
guess
an
equal
impact
would
not
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
to
put
it
more
simply,
a
shared
purpose
to
treat
them
differently
from
the
members
who
are
not
in
the
class,
that's
the
whole
thing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
what
is
the
aggravation
in
this
case
under
the
bill
of
complaint
beyond
nearly
preferring
to
employ
men
to
women.
is
that
aggregation
--
aggravation
per
se?
