we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
753,
great

association
against
novotny.
mr.
connors,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.

mr.

chief

mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace,
it's
certainly
a
pattern
in
the
business
life
of
this
country
and
that's
carried
over
into
the
government
of
this
country
and
right
into
this
court,
that
most
of
the
secretaries
of
the
justices
and
the
presidents
of
corporations
and
congressmen
are
women.
now
would
that
be
the
kind
of
shared
purpose
or
some
way,
are
all
these
people
disfavoring
men
because
we
have
found
that
at
least
we
think
we
have
found
that
women
are
more
dexterous,
they
do
a
lot
of
things
better
than
men
do.
so,
i
think
for
years
and
years
there
is
two
or
three
exceptions
over
this
century
all
the
secretaries
of
justices
on
this
court
have
been
women.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
they're
just
frightened
away
by
the
tradition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
terminates
this.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
