justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
the
third
circuit's
answer
to
that
be
that
with
respect
to
all
persons
employed
by
employers
are
15
or
more
persons,
it
is
a
right
to
equal
treatment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stein,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
titles
have
the
right
--
you
say
it
is
created
by
title
vii
is
the
substantive
right
which
you
are
seeking
to
enforce
under
1985?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
that's
what
the
third
circuit
said?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no
one
is
challenging
this
title
vii
remedy
here.
the
question
is
whether
the
title
vii
right
is
one
that
can
be
enforced
not
only
under
the
title
vii
procedure
setup
in
64
but
it's
also
a
subject
to
the
procedures
provided
in
1985
(3).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
then
that
your
client
could
not
vote
directly
to
court
as
soon
as
the
claim
retaliation
took
place
under
1985
(3)
but
would
first
have
to
go
to
the
eeoc?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
who
want
who
could
assert
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
since
you're
an
amicus,
mr.
wallace
i
presume
you're
not
entitled
to
enlarge
your
or
subtract
the
issues
in
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
1981
rights
don't
depend
in
any
way
on
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
reason
--
the
right
plan
here
does
depend
on
title
vii.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
they
intended
the
title
vii
remedies
where
to
be
enforced
in
any
other
way
than
that
provided
in
title
vii?
