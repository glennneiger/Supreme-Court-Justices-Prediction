mr.
eugene
k.
connors
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
this
case
was
brought
under
two
federal
statutes.
the
first
statute
is
title
42
u.s.
code
section
1985
(c).
previously
it
was
codified
as
42
u.s.c.
1985
(3)
but
it's
more
popularly
known
as
the
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871
passed
on
april
20th
of
that
year.
the
second
federal
statute
under
which
the
suit
is
brought
is
section
704
(a)
the
so-called
retaliation
provision
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
it's
a
suit
brought
by
a
person
named
john
novotny,
a
former
second
ranking
official
in
the
pittsburg,
pennsylvania
savings
and
loan
association.
it
was
brought
against
the
association
and
its
individual
officers
and
directors.
the
facts
alleged
are
that
the
association
and
its
individual
officers
and
directors
discriminated
against
women
in
promotions
and
other
aspects
of
employment.
mr.
novotny
allegedly
protested
against
this
at
a
board
of
directors
meeting.
his
title
vii
cause
of
action
is
grounded
upon
the
allegation
that
his
subsequent
discharge
resulted
from
his
protest
at
the
board
of
directors
meeting
and
therefore
was
opposition
against
a
practice
made
unlawful
within
the
meaning
of
section
704
(a).
that
cause
of
action
incidentally
was
brought
against
both
the
association
and
the
individual
officers
and
directors.
the
1985
(3)
cause
of
action
is
grounded
upon
the
allegation
that
the
individual
officers
and
directors
acting
at
all
times
on
behalf
of
the
association
conspired
to
deprive
women
of
their
title
vii
rights
and
they
acted
further
into
the
conspiracy
was
mr.
novotny's
discharge.
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court
was
filed
and
granted
as
to
both
causes
of
action.
the
third
circuit
however
sitting
en
banc
reversed
this
to
both
causes
of
action.
certiorari
was
sought
and
granted
only
on
the
1985
(3)
cause
of
action.
therefore,
mr.
novotny's
title
vii
retaliation
cause
of
action
against
both
the
association
and
the
individuals
will
survive
irrespective
of
the
outcome
in
this
court.
the
issues
as
we
see
them
are
three,
whether
a
depravation
of
title
vii
rights
is
a
depravation
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
laws
within
the
meaning
of
1985
(3).
secondly,
whether
agents
of
a
corporation
acting
only
on
the
corporation's
behalf
can
conspire
within
the
meaning
of
1985
(3).
and
thirdly
and
lastly,
whether
the
congress
under
1985
(3)
intended
to
reach
sex
discrimination
in
private
employment
through
the
commerce
clause
or
otherwise.
the
language
in
1985
(3)
material
to
this
case
grants
a
federal
remedy
when
two
or
more
persons
conspire
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
a
class
of
persons
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
laws.
it
grants
this
civil
cause
of
action
to
a
person
injured
in
his
person
or
property
were
deprived
of
any
right
or
privilege
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
moving
to
our
first
issue
to
determine
whether
title
vii
grants
equal
privileges
under
the
laws,
we
believe
it's
most
appropriate
to
see
what
the
effect
of
the
third
circuit's
opinion
is
on
the
workings
of
title
vii
which
is
the
right
allegedly
being
asserted
under
1985
(3)
here.
through
title
vii,
congress
has
created
certain
rights
to
be
free
from
discrimination
in
private
employment
including
for
the
first
time
effective
july
2,
1965
sex
discrimination.
at
the
same
time,
congress
created
what
in
section
706
is
the
exclusive
procedure
for
asserting
and
enforcing
this
title
vii
created
rights.
according
to
mr.
novotny
and
the
third
circuit
however,
1985
(3)
made
title
vii's
administrative
judicial
procedures
permissive
at
the
very
moment
of
its
creation.
a
person
deprived
of
any
title
vii
right
whatsoever
can
bypass
title
vii.
congress
has
carefully
designed,
carefully
thought
out
administrative
judicial
framework
with
its
emphasis
on
conciliation
and
with
specific
time
limits,
deferral,
provisions,
all
can
be
very
easily
subverted.
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
or
a
state
fair
employment
practice
agency,
the
agencies
charged
by
the
congress
with
expertise
in
these
matters
that
are
supposed
to
take
a
very
active
role
in
conciliation
and
persuasion
within
the
framework
at
the
administrative
processes
in
title
vii
can
be
avoided.
alternatively
of
course,
a
person
under
the
third
circuit's
reading
of
1985
(3)
can
proceed
through
the
administrative
processes
of
title
vii
and
ultimately
perhaps
the
federal
court
and
at
the
same
time
proceed
immediately
to
federal
court
under
1985
(3)
creating
a
very
real
possibility
of
conflicting
erroneous
inconsistent
decisions.
this
situation
is
different
from
what
this
court
decided
in
the
johnson
versus
railway
express
case.
johnson
involved
a
preexisting
independent
right
to
sue
under
section
1981
of
title
42.
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
1985
(3)
being
read
to
take
a
right
created
by
title
vii
and
thereby
invalidate
the
administrative
processes
under
which
that
title
vii
created
right
was
to
be
asserted
and
enforced.
in
addition,
despite
the
third
circuit's
disclaimer
that
1985
(3)
would
not
apply
to
anything
beyond
equal
employment
opportunities.
there's
no
holding
back
the
thrust
of
the
third
circuit's
opinion.
the
thrust
--
the
logical
trust
of
that
opinion
is
to
extend
1985
(3)
to
any
federal
substantive
statute
irrespective
of
whether
such
a
statute
has
it's
own
administrative
framework
and
irrespective
of
whether
congress
decided
and
designed
it
to
be
handled
exclusively
through
it's
own
administrative
processes.
we
would
have
in
this
court
and
other
courts
a
needless
flood
of
duplicative
litigation
under
such
laws
as
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
the
equal
pay
act,
the
labor
management
reporting
a
disclosure
act,
the
age
discrimination
employment
act,
and
we
can
multiply
that
by
10's
and
20's
and
30's
and
40's.
in
our
view
however,
that
chaotic
unreasonable
result
is
unnecessary
because
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
mr.
justice
stevens
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
yes,
they
did,
but
i
believe
under
these
statutes
you
can
read
the
word
equal
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
apply
to
this
and
other
sorts
of
laws.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
the
third
circuit's
logic,
i
believe,
compels
the
court
to
draw
some
sort
of
a
line
between
what
rights
are
assertable
under
1985
(3).
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
i'm
not
sure
i
read
the
third
circuit's
opinion
to
say
that
i
see
the
logical
thrust
of
the
third
circuit's
opinion
to
reach
any
federal
law
that
creates
a
right
assertable
in
federal
court
in
respect
of
whether
it's
otherwise
assertable
within
the
framework
of
that
law.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
i
understand,
your
honor.
we
believe
however
that
the
chaos
is
unnecessary
and
the
unreasonable
result
is
unnecessary
because
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
and
the
draftsmen
and
sponsors
of
1985
(3)
made
clear
that
1985
(3)
is
a
remedial
statute.
in
fact,
the
third
circuit
specifically
quoted
from
both
senator
edmunds
who
was
the
floor
manager
in
the
senate
for
1985
(3),
then
of
course
the
ku
klux
klan
act
and
also
representative
shellabarger.
the
third
circuit
quotes
from
these
two
individuals
appear
at
pages
27-a
and
29-a
of
the
court's
opinion
as
reproduced
in
the
cert
petition.
1985
(3)
does
not
stand
on
its
own,
it
needs
a
right
from
another
source.
it's
a
remedy
in
search
of
a
right.
for
that
reason,
it's
unlike
such
laws
as
1981
or
title
vii
which
are
substantive
statutes
combining
both
a
right
remedy.
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
1985
(3)
and
for
instance
1981.
admittedly,
the
phrase
laws
in
1985
(3)
appears
all
inclusive
but
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
congress
was
creating
a
federal
remedy
and
a
federal
form
to
assert
rights,
federal
rights
where
none
previously
existed.
it
was
a
need
filling
statute
the
ku
klux
klan
act
was
finally
passed
in
1871
by
the
congress
because
congress
learned
from
painful
experience
that
it
wasn't
enough
to
just
create
laws
--
create
rights
under
for
instance
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
fifteenth
amendments
saying
that
citizens
had
certain
rights.
the
states
and
private
individuals
is
recognized
in
the
griffin
case
who
are
unable
or
who
are
unwilling
to
protect
and
respect
such
naked
rights,
unassertable
rights.
under
1985
(3),
congress
made
for
the
first
time
such
previously
unassertable
rights
assertable
in
federal
court.
1985
(3)
was
and
therefore
is
a
gap
filling
statute
to
fulfill
a
particular
need.
it
wasn't
designed
to
supplant
or
replace
other
carefully
thought-out
legislation
which
stands
on
its
own
like
title
vii.
it
was
meant
to
apply
where
an
existing
remedy
if
it
did
not
exist
or
was
not
being
enforced.
additionally,
in
1985
(3)
the
phrase
“equal
privileges”
is
mentioned,
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
law.
we're
talking
here
about
sex
discrimination.
not
every
citizen
has
a
federal
right
to
be
free
from
employment
discrimination
under
title
vii
and
that's
the
right
we're
talking
about
here.
for
instance
only
employees
who
are
employed
by
employers
employing
15
or
more
individuals
have
a
federal
right
to
be
free
from
sex
discrimination.
in
other
words,
since
not
every
citizen
has
a
right
--
a
federal
right
to
be
free
from
sex
discrimination,
in
our
view,
freedom
from
sex
discrimination
is
not
in
equal
with
the
acts
on
equal
privilege
and
immunity
because
it
isn't
extended
to
each
and
every
citizen.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
the
third
circuit
may
well
say
that
but
if
we
go
a
little
bit
farther
in
the
language
of
the
statute
it
says
in
order
to
assert
a
civil
cause
of
action
under
1985
(3),
a
person
must
be
injured
in
his
person,
in
his
property,
or
deprived
of
a
right
of
national
citizenship.
and
i
submit
that
you
do
not
have
a
right
of
national
citizenship
to
be
free
from
sex
discrimination
since
all
citizens
do
not
have
that
right.
griffin
recognized
the
possibility
that
courts
could
read
1985
(3)
to
be
the
(inaudible)
it
was
not
and
caution
against
reading
1985
(3)
as
a
general
federal
tort
law.
we
believe
that
third
circuit's
overbroad
analysis
and
construction
of
1985
(3)
creates
a
general
federal
tort
law
despite
the
language
in
for
instance
griffin
which
talks
about
having
to
establish
under
1985
(3)
and
invidiously
discriminatory
class-based
animus.
we
submit
that
whenever
you
violate
title
vii
you
automatically
have
class-based
animus
because
we
have
created,
congress
has
created
certain
protected
classes
such
as
sex,
national
origin
race,
etcetera
under
title
vii
to
automatically
would
have
class-based
discrimination.
invidiously
discriminatory,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
that
means.
i
do
know
from
the
screws
case
and
from
the
footnote
in
the
griffin
case
that
it
does
not
mean
specific
intent,
so
it
means
something
less
and
it
may
very
well
mean
something
as
simple
to
prove
and
automatically
approve
as
people
intended
the
logical
consequences
of
their
action.
and
thirdly,
since
we're
dealing
here
with
a
corporation
i
submit
--
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
corporation
or
not.
i
would
submit
it
virtually
every
decision
to
discharge
somebody,
not
to
hire
someone
has
a
legal
plurality
of
personalities
involved.
in
other
words,
at
least
two
people
have
had
input
into
that
situation.
and
if
you
have
two
people
having
input,
you
have
a
conspiracy.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
at
least
two,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
oh,
with
these
(inaudible)
two
would
be
fine,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
(inaudible)
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
we
feel
that
the
only
sensible
way
to
read
laws
within
the
meaning
of
1985
(3)
are
laws
creating
right
not
otherwise
assertable
without
1985
(3).
in
other
words,
as
a
gap
filling
statute
as
the
1871
congress
fully
intended.
there
are
court
cases
which
go
beyond
the
readings,
go
beyond
that
position
and
i
refer
to
that
view
as
the
broad
view.
those
court
cases
have
confined
--
confines
the
wrong
word.
they
say
1985
(3)
covers
rights
which
came
into
existence
after
1871
including
statutory
rights.
now,
we
submit
that
under
are
view
with
the
statute
even
if
this
court
takes
that
view,
this
case
ought
to
be
dismissed
as
to
the
1985
(3)
cause
of
action
simply
because
if
the
laws
that
were
created
after
1871
including
statutory
rights,
creating
statutory
rights
are
not
otherwise
assertable
without
1985,
they're
covered
under
1985
(3)
but
that
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
is
title
vii.
we
believe
however,
the
correct
reading
of
1985
(3)
is
the
reading
that
takes
the
statutory
construction
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe,
i
would
characterize
thirteenth
amendment
rights
standing
alone
and
not
otherwise
implemented
by
a
law
with
the
right
to
interstate
commerce
as
a
naked
right
not
otherwise
assertable
and
that's
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
that
--
bivens
versus
the
six
unknown
narcotics
agents?
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
that
involve
--
state
involvement
and
under
the
fourth,
i
believe.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
i
believe
when
we
have
state
of
federal
involvement
there,
your
honor,
we're
talking
about
a
different
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
that's
like
the
fourth
amendment.
we're
talking
about
a
different
situation.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
yes,
we
are.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
not
without
state
involvement,
your
honor,
and
that's
precisely
i
believe,
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
is
not
assertable
unless
there
is
a
federal
remedy
such
as
1985
(3).
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
and
i
believe
that
is
exactly
the
problem
the
congress
grappled
with
within
the
legislative
history
underlying
1985
(3).
several
people
spoke
to
the
issue,
i
guess
first
promulgated
by
james
madison
in
the
federalist
papers
that
the
creation
of
a
right
implies
a
remedy
and
several
opponents
of
1985
(3)
said,
"why
do
we
need
to
do
anything?
we
have
a
federal
right."
it
implies
a
remedy
as
james
madison
said,
"why
don't
we
just
go
ahead
and
let
people
come
in
to
federal
court
and
assert
those
rights
even
though
we
don't
have
a
remedy?"
the
very
telling
point
made
immediately
after
that
argument
was
that
i
forgot
the
gentleman's
name
but
he
said,
"that's
all
well
and
good,
that's
--
we
created
those
rights
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
but
that
didn't
stop
two
very
close
friends
of
mine
from
being
shut
down
in
the
state
of
florida."
we
need
something
that
specifically
tells
people
that
they
have
a
remedy
and
federal
court
to
assert
what
we
believe
is
an
unassertable
right.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
there
was
a
fair
amount
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
ambivalence
on
the
part
of
the
state
at
that
time.
and
i
believe
the
fact
that
you
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
yes,
but
i
believe
the
decision
on
the
part
of
a
majority
of
the
congress
both
put
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
was
we
need
to
show
and
tell
people
that
they
have
a
federal
remedy
where
you
have
naked
federal
rights.
here
it
is,
section
1
which
is
1983
and
here
is
section
2
which
is
now
1985
(3)
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
--
and
the
reason
why
--
and
i
take
this
--
i'm
going
to
make
one
additional
point.
i'll
also
say
that
the
criminal
counterpart
of
1985
(3)
which
is
now
in
codified
as
title
18
section
241
is
not
--
is
more
broad
rather
than
1985
(3).
and
that's
because
1985
(3)
unlike
1983
and
unlike
section
241
goes
on
to
say
that
in
order
to
assert
a
civil
cause
of
action
a
person
has
to
be
injured
in
his
personal
property
or
deprived
of
the
right
of
national
citizenship.
that
language
does
not
appear
in
the
criminal
counterpart
and
it
also
doesn't
appear
in
1983
which
was
section
one
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act.
and
that's
why
i
think
this
case
basically
is
a
case
of
statutory
interpretation
and
construction.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
that
argument
was
made
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
since
the
case
came
down
nine
to
nothing
i
suggest
that
the
third
circuit
was
not
persuaded
by
that
argument.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
exactly.
i
mean
i
agree
fully,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
that
language
follows
that
only
is
contained
in
1985
(3).
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
now,
i
consider
myself
in
good
company,
your
honor.
but
our
position
is
that
that
language
that
follows
the
special
language
that
follows
in
1985
(3)
tells
us
really
what
congress
intended
to
reach
as
far
as
rights
are
concerned
as
far
as
the
civil
conspiracy
remedy
now
set
forth
in
1985
(3)
or
(c)
or
however
you
prefer
to
it.
and
that
view
as
i
said
is
taken
from
1985
(3)
itself.
it
says
specifically
that
the
civil
action
is
available
only
to
a
person,
injured
in
it's
personal
property
or
deprived
of
any
right
or
privilege
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
statutory
rights
aren't
mentioned
by
1985
(3).
in
this
case,
mr.
novotny
has
alleged
no
injury
to
this
person
and
i
submit
that
no
one
under
situation
like
this
has
any
injury
to
this
person
or
a
depravation
of
a
property
right.
there's
no
property
right
to
a
job
and
thirdly,
there's
no
deprivation
of
a
right
of
citizenship.
as
i've
said
earlier,
title
vii
does
not
give
an
untrammeled
right
to
ever
citizen
to
be
free
from
sex
discrimination.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
we
are
talking
about
constitutional
rights
though,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
--
all
i'm
saying
is
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
those
naked
unassertable
rights
contained
in
the
constitution,
yes.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
where
it
says
that
a
person
has
a
civil
remedy
when
he's
injured
in
his
personal
property
or
deprived
of
any
right
or
privilege
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
those
--
the
phrase
rights
of
privileges
admittedly
are
terms
of
art.
the
draftsmen
in
the
house
and
the
floor
manager
representative
shellabarger
talks
about
privileges,
immunities
and
says
that
they
are
fundamental
rights
inherent
in
citizenship
of
the
united
states
as
derived
from
the
constitution.
now,
a
little
bit
later
in
the
statutory
in
the
legislative
history
representative
kerr
from
i
believe
illinois
said,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying
about
privileges
and
immunities
being
fundamental
rights
of
citizenship
derived
from
the
constitution
but
in
your
first
draft,
you've
got
rights,
privileges,
and
immunities.
and
mr.
shellabarger,
a
couple
of
pages
later
finally
got
around
to
saying,
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
rights
are
derived
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
i'm
sorry
i
missed
that
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
that's
correct,
so
we're
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
having
been
passed
by
that
time.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
she
couldn't
vote
but
she
was
a
citizen,
your
honor.
she
--
women
did
lack
a
lot
of
the
attributes
of
citizenship
at
that
time.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
of
a
citizen,
yes,
admittedly.
admittedly,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
yes,
your
honor,
thirteenth
amendment
and
right
to
interstate
travel.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
it
was
--
it
was
his
right
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
petition
the
government
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
--
for
the
reject
of
grievances.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
and
injuries
the
persons
or
property
to
the
extent
that
it
arises
under
the
constitution,
yes.
but
we're
saying
that
you
even
though
that's
are
view
which
is
taken
from
the
statute,
even
if
this
court
takes
the
broad
view
taken
by
other
circuits
in
district
courts,
this
case
can
also
be
dismissed
because
the
congressional
intent
was
only
to
apply
1985
(3)
where
the
right
was
not
otherwise
assertable
and
title
vii
of
course
is
otherwise
assertable.
so,
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
--
this
court
has
a
choice.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
yes,
he
did
assert
his
title
vii
rights
within
the
context
of
title
vii.
he
filed
a
charge
and
his
title
vii
action
is
brought
against
both
the
association
and
the
individuals
and
that
will
survive
--
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
yes.
yes
your
honor.
as
we've
pointed
out,
to
determine
what
a
corporate
--
moving
to
our
second
issues
since
i
see
my
time
is
fast
moving.
to
determine
whether
a
corporate
agent
is
acting
on
the
corporation's
behalf
can
conspire
under
1985
(3),
we
must
recognize
first
of
all
how
our
corporation
really
acts
exclusively
through
its
agents
incapable
of
acting
without
them.
that's
why
a
corporation
is
only
one
person
under
the
law.
next
we
must
see
if
under
1985
(3)
there's
any
need
to
disregard
how
a
corporation
really
acts
and
we
say
there
is
no
need
for
several
reasons.
first,
because
under
title
vii
the
corporate
veil
can
be
pierced
in
the
classic
sense
where
a
corporation
is
a
shell
without
assets
or
erected
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
also
under
title
vii,
an
agent
can
be
held
individually
liable.
in
fact,
the
solicitor
general
has
cited
a
few
cases
in
his
brief
to
that
effect
and
that's
taken
from
the
definition
of
section
701
(b)
which
defines
an
employer
as
a
corporation
and
any
of
its
agents.
under
principles
of
tort,
agents
can
be
held
individually
liable
as
joint
tortfeasors
through
principles
of
respondeat
superior,
a
corporation
and
its
agents
are
already
exposed
to
liability.
much
as
individual
conspirators
are
exposed
to
liability
in
a
civil
conspiracy
context.
we
say
there
isn't
any
need
to
punish,
to
get
out
and
punish
the
conspirators
because
this
1985
(3)
creates
a
civil
conspiracy
and
it's
only
a
criminal
conspiracy
that
is
out
to
punish
individual
conspirators.
that's
the
job
of
section
241
of
title
18.
we
also
say
that
to
rule
it
otherwise
and
to
say
that
a
corporation
can
conspire
with
its
agents
could
very
easily
show
collect
of
action.the
very
life
blood
of
the
corporation.
and
finally,
the
dictionary
act
which
was
passed
on
february
25,
of
1871
near
days
before
1985
(3)
was
drafted,
defined
the
word
person
to
include
the
corporation
as
noted
in
this
court's
monell
decision
to
include
a
corporation
within
the
framework
of
the
definition
person
unless
the
contacts
to
the
statute
clearly
indicates
a
more
limited
definition.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
eugene
k.
connors
i'm
sorry.
