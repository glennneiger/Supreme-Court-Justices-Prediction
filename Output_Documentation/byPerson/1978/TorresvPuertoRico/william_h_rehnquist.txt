justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
remcho,
you
are
arguing
the
fourth
amendment
here
i
take
it.
does
the
fourth
amendment
plane
out
so
to
speak
limit
the
authority
of
the
puerto
rican
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
either
because
it
is
analogous
to
a
state
and
the
fourth
amendment
is
incorporated
by
the
fourteenth?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
on
pretty
thin
ground,
if
you
are
persuaded
by
my
dissent
in
otero,
since
you
presumably
have
eight
people
versus
one
person?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
and
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
unreasonable
searches?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
i
take
it
in
times
of
emergency,
a
city
or
a
particular
area
can
declare
a
curfew
that
it
couldn't
declare
it
other
times
without
violating
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
supposing
that
puerto
rican
legislature
here
had
decided
that
there
was,
and
i
gather
from
the
opinions
of
the
three
justices
in
the
minority
in
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
that
there
was
a
real
crime
wave
and
a
drug
wave
in
puerto
rico
and
that
a
great
deal
of
it
was
the
result
of
people
coming
into
puerto
rico
from
the
united
states.
do
you
think
it
is
wholly
beyond
reason
to
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
would
permit
airport
searches
of
luggages
where
you
do
not
have
homes
involved
or
you
can
perhaps
stop
all
that
traffic
in
one
public
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
two
centuries.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
akron
against
bryant
point
may
well
be
an
adequate
state
ground,
but
the
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
fourth
amendment
question
is
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
not
rule
on
the
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
--
if
the
constituent
act
said
in
so
many
words
that
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
will
not
consider
any
united
states
constitutional
claims
in
hearing
an
appeal
from
a
conviction.
i
suppose
then
the
high
of
--
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
is
not
the
highest
court
of
a
state
in
which
a
judgment
can
be
had
for
purposes
of
considering
those
claims
and
you
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
or
superior
court
in
puerto
rico
and
say
that
was
the
court
you
are
appealing
from.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
about
not
of
one
mind.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
armstrong,
you
do
not
doubt,
do
you,
that
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
has
entered
a
judgment
affirming
the
conviction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
constitution
of
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
required
an
affirmance
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
armstrong,
you
are
saying
that
the
defendant
is
in
a
worse
position
because
three
of
the
justices
disagreed
with
him
than
he
would
have
been
if
all
seven
justices
disagreed
with
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
all
seven
justices
had
rejected
his
constitutional
claim,
the
judgment
would
have
been
affirmed
and
the
statute
would
have
been
upheld.
and
he
certainly
could
have
brought
that
claim
here
for
independent
decision
by
this
court
on
the
federal
constitutional
question,
could
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the
puerto
rican
constitution
went
even
further
than
it
does
now
and
said
that
no
court
in
puerto
rico
shall
ever
have
a
right
to
upset
a
conviction
of
a
criminal
defendant
on
a
federal
constitutional
ground,
couldn't
a
defendant
who
asserted
a
federal
constitutional
ground
that
was
not
heard
by
any
of
the
puerto
rican
courts
for
that
reason,
nonetheless
bring
that
case
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
several
years
ago,
this
court
upheld
a
60%
majority
requirement
for
a
bond
approval
in
west
virginia,
didn't
it?
