mr.
joseph
remcho
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
may
constitutionally
enact
and
enforce
a
statute
authorizing
its
police
to
conduct
indiscriminate
warrantless
searches
of
the
luggage,
packages,
bundles
and
bags
of
persons
arriving
in
puerto
rico
from
the
mainland
united
states.
mr.
joseph
remcho
what
i
mean
to
embrace
by
indiscriminate
is
as
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
found,
the
statute
public
law
22
authorizes
the
individual
police
officer,
not
a
customs
official,
but
the
individual
police
officer.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
i
think
it
makes
a
substantial
difference.
that
goes
to
the
whole
question
of
whether
puerto
rico
may
in
the
first
place,
setup
any
kind
of
a
customs
search.
mr.
joseph
remcho
so
let
me
get
to
that
question
then
directly
and
take
up
the
others
later.
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
was
created
by
the
commonwealth
compact,
but
nothing
in
that
compact
reserved
to
puerto
rico
the
right
in
any
fashion
to
setup
its
own
border
between
the
united
states
and
puerto
rico.
in
fact,
with
respect
to
customs,
19
us
code
section
1202(a)
specifically
includes
puerto
rico
within
united
states
customs
territory.
the
commonwealth
compact
itself
and
the
additional
puerto
rico
federal
relations
act,
includes
a
carefully
considered
set
of
regulations
and
a
compact
between
the
united
states
congress
and
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
with
respect
to
how
those
two
parties
will
relate
to
each
other
and
there
is
nothing
in
that
compact,
which
i
find
which
specifically
or
implicitly
authorizes
puerto
rico
to
setup
any
kind
of
a
border
between
itself
and
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
that
is
great,
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
but
that
is
what
a
border
is
all
about;
people
coming
from
one
place
to
the
other
regardless
of
whether
they
are
residents
of
puerto
rico
or
the
united
states
mainland.
the
commonwealth
has
taken
the
position
with
respect
to
the
border
not
that
they
have
the
power
or
have
indeed
created
anything
like
an
international
border.
the
position
they
took
below
at
least
was
that
they
had
the
power
to
create
a
functional
equivalent
of
a
border.
and
i
think
that
misconstrues
this
court's
cases
with
respect
to
what
a
functional
equivalent
of
a
border
is.
as
the
court
held
in
almeida-sanchez,
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
border
is
basically
the
same
thing
as
a
border
only
for
practical
necessary
reasons
that
border
has
been
moved.
so
for
example,
st.
louis
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
united
states
border
for
a
person
arriving
for
the
first
time
in
united
states
and
the
confluence
of
two
or
three
roads
right
near
the
mexican-united
states
border
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border
and
that
is
the
only
practical
place
where
us
customs
officials
can
conduct
their
duties.
the
defect
here
is
in
going
back
to
your
initial
question
is
that
the
border
search
cases,
which
allowed
even
certain
exceptions,
which
setup
the
functional
equivalent
system
and
allowed
certain
exceptions
to
normal
probable
cause,
excuse
me,
to
normal
search
and
stop
procedures,
where
search
is
conducted
by
customs
officials
and
persons
authorized
to
do
that,
and
that
by
its
very
nature,
limited
the
type
of
the
search.
mr.
joseph
remcho
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
remcho
there
is
no
magic
in
the
word
customs.
you
can
clearly
put
one
there
if
there
is
in
fact
an
international
border,
but
i
think
the
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
absolutely,
you
can
put
â€“-
mr.
joseph
remcho
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
remcho
absolutely.
but
the
analogy
i
think
as
to
when
you
can
put
a
policeman
there
and
when
you
put
someone
else
there,
applies
more
to
what
is
sometimes
used
as
inspection
searches
that
is
where
state
of
california
may
setup
an
inspection
point
for
pest
and
plant
material
coming
in
from
arizona.
in
a
situation
like
that,
clearly
they
can't
setup
and
have
never
tried
to
setup
police
officers
to
search
people
coming
from
arizona
to
california,
but
they
have
had
a
very
limited
scope
of
authority
covered
by
regulatory
discretion
for
health
officials
to
examine
matter
coming
in.
and
so,
there
is
a
distinction
in
that
thing
between
a
police
officer
and
a
customs
type
official.
mr.
joseph
remcho
he
is
a
united
states
citizen,
i
am
not
sure
if
the
record
reflects
that
fact.
in
fact,
it
does
not.
mr.
joseph
remcho
he
resides
in
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
joseph
remcho
the
fourth
amendment
in
my
view
clearly
limits
the
authority
of
the
puerto
rican
legislature,
that
is
correct,
and
i
would
say
in
any
one
of
the
four
rationale
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief.
mr.
joseph
remcho
no.
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
was
persuaded
by
your
dissent
in
otero
that
in
passing
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
clearly
distinction
was
made
between
a
state
and
something,
which
is
not
a
state.
so,
i
am
not
arguing
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
and
off
itself
carries
the
fourth
amendment
into
puerto
rico
in
the
traditional
incorporation
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
i
am
persuaded
only
by
the
point
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
apply
directly
in
the
same
fashion
as
if
puerto
rico
were
a
state.
i
am
not
saying
that
that
is
what
does
it.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
what
i
take
it
the
majority
meant
in
that
case
was
that
when
congress
pursuant
to
its
territorial
power
created
this
compact
with
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
and
said
that
all
the
constitutional
provisions
not
inapplicable
will
apply,
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
in
that
manner,
and
through
that
way,
but
i
do
not
--
so
that
is
how
it
applies
as
a
state.
congress
said
it
will
apply
as
if
it
were
a
state.
i
do
not
read
the
opinion
to
say
anything
other
than
it
applies
just
like
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
necessarily
it
comes
directly
from
it.
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
suppose
that
would
depend
very
much
on
the
facts
of
the
situation
but
i
concede
that
is
possible
at
some
point.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
do
think
it
is
wholly
unreasonable.
i
think
that
in
the
first
place,
there
are
absolutely
no
facts
in
any
offered
by
the
government
or
in
the
legislative
finding
that
there
is
a
danger
from
these
guns,
which
supports
anything
other
than
a
generalized
statement
that
there
is
a
danger.
when
i
spoke
of
a
curfew,
i
could
see
it
in
a
narrow
situation
when
perhaps
you
know,
if
there
is
an
earthquake
in
san
francisco,
you
can
impose
a
curfew,
but
to
say
that
you
could
impose
a
curfew
at
any
time
because
of
a
non-differentiated,
generalized
concern
about
the
con
problem
is
to
just
totally
ignore
the
200
centuries
of
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence,
which
you
said
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
two
centuries,
excuse
me,
almost
two
centuries.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
am
sorry.
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
read
it
the
same
way.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
think
that
is
probably
correct.
if
in
fact,
this
court
accepts
the
concession
of
the
government
below
as
i
hope
it
will,
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
if
in
fact
he
has
conceded
the
fourth
amendment
issue,
i
do
not
care
about
the
other
issue,
because
that
decides
this
case.
mr.
joseph
remcho
if
this
court
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
what
i
am
asking,
and
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
yes,
it
would,
that
is
what
we
would
ask
the
court
to
do.
mr.
joseph
remcho
why
would
you
have
to
hold
that
it
is
unconstitutional?
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct,
okay.
we
are
in
the
same
position
in
this
court,
i
take
it,
as
if
we
had
lost
seven-nothing
below.
we
did
not
lose
seven-nothing
below.
we
lost
four-three
to
below
pursuant
to
that
particular
puerto
rico
constitutional
provision.
a
judgment
was
entered
against
us.
we
made
a
timely
appeal
to
this
court.
the
judgment
upheld
the
validity
of
the
conviction.
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
reverse
that
conviction;
to
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
that
search
and
judgment
for
the
appellant
has
to
be
entered.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
do
not
think,
it
was
not
decided
on
an
adequate
--
the
judgment
entered
was
against
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
think
you
can.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
think
you
can
and
the
reason
is
this.
the
government
appealed
at
the
time;
both
two
things.
we
appealed;
the
government
contended
at
that
time
and
continued
to
contend
until
recently
that,
that
fourth
amendment
judgment
was
wrong.
if
this
court,
which
is
a
final
arbitrator
of
the
fourth
amendment
says
to
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico,
we
tell
you
that
that
you
were
right.
mr.
joseph
remcho
you
were
right
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
yes,
and
as
soon
as
we
tell
the
court
that
and
declare
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
then
that
court
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
understand
that.
they
do
not
have
the
power.
if
it
is
they
who
say
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
if
this
court
says
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
there
is
nothing
in
the
puerto
rico
constitution,
which
prohibits
that
court
from
entering
judgment
favoring
the
appellant.
mr.
joseph
remcho
no,
i
am
not
saying
that
the
akron
versus
bryant
may
be
inadequate
state
ground
at
all.
what
i
am
saying,
i
am
saying
that
the
decision
in
akron
is
wrong,
excuse
me,
that
the
decision
below
upholding
that
judgment
while
they
thought
the
statute
was
not
constitutional,
is
incorrect.
i
am
saying,
you
do
not
necessarily
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
akron
was
wrong,
because
i
think
you
can
just
go
back
to
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court
with
a
declaration
that
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
that
court
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
what
the
statute
--
the
constitution
provision
says
that,
that
particular
court
may
not
hold
a
statute
unconstitutional
without
that
"super-majority".
if
this
court
holds
it
unconstitutional,
that
court
can
certainly
enter
judgment
in
favor
of
the
appellant.
mr.
joseph
remcho
and
not
violated
public
law
22?
mr.
joseph
remcho
the
court's
specific
holding
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
think
there
are
two
responses
to
that.
mr.
joseph
remcho
first
is
they
did
not
think
so.
first
is
they
clearly
did
not
think
so,
and
they
are
the
ones
who
interpret
what
that
constitution
provision
means.
mr.
joseph
remcho
yes,
under
this
court's
decision
in
fornaro,
you
are
bound
by
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
constitutional
provision
unless
that
interpretation
is
inescapably
wrong,
and
it
certainly
not
inescapably
wrong.
secondly,
i
think
it
would
be
disingenuous.
mr.
joseph
remcho
yes.
mr.
joseph
remcho
by
puerto
rico
criminal
statutes
by
rule
3
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct,
no.
mr.
joseph
remcho
the
controversy
is
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
would
say
if
the
state
now
concedes
that
issue,
there
is
no
more
controversy
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
it's
correct,
thank
you.
there
is
no
more
controversy
over
that
then
it
would
be
after
a
court
entered
judgment,
if
anyone
anywhere
along
the
line
gave
up
on
that
issue.
they
have
given
up
on
that
issue,
fine,
let
us
remand
it,
if
they
have,
let
us
remand
it
to
puerto
rican
supreme
court
for
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
let
me
put
it
differently.
if
we
had
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
make
a
few
comments
about
what
was
raised
in
the
â€“
giving
before
the
lunch
hour.
first
this
court
is
not
bound
by
the
concessions
of
a
government.
in
sibron
versus
new
york
for
example,
the
kings
county
prosecutor
conceded
that,
that
statute
had
been
violated.
and
this
court
pointed
out
that
concessions
by
the
parties
do
not
relieve
it
from
what
it
called
the
obligation
to
perform
a
judicial
function,
where
federal
constitutional
rights
in
state
courts
are
decided
and
where
this
court
is
already
had
the
benefit
of
full
briefing
and
argument
on
that
fourth
amendment
claim,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
concession
of
the
government
would
not
bind
this
court.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
is
still
a
contrary.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
if
puerto
rico
had
a
rule
which
say
that
â€“-
mr.
joseph
remcho
they
did,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
remcho
fourâ€“toâ€“two,
that
is
right.
if
puerto
rico
had
a
rule
that
there
was
no
appeal
allowed
at
all
from
a
decision
by
a
lower
court,
we
would
be
--
and
the
lower
court
had
upheld
the
statute,
this
court
would
have
full
authority
to
decide
that
statute.
the
fact
that
there
was
no
appellate
review
at
least
putting
aside
the
question
of
whether
it
is
required,
at
least
would
not
be
considered
in
independent
state
ground
to
uphold
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
and
what
is
happened
is
that
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court
has
taken
article
v,
section
4
and
said
that
renders
it
powerless
in
a
sense
to
decide
this
appeal.
and
if
that
is
true,
it
is
no
different
then
if
we
directly
here
from
the
judgment
of
the
superior
court,
which
is
a
judgment
in
question.
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
right
we
lost,
but
we
can
hardly
be
in
a
worst
position
than
if
we
had
no
right
to
appeal
at
all.
i
agree
we
lost,
but
that
court
in
affirming
the
judgment,
we
are
saying
no
more
than
it
was
not
going
to
rule
on
that
appeal,
even
though
it
believed
--
the
majority
believed
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
joseph
remcho
it
affirmed
the
judgment.
mr.
joseph
remcho
okay,
but
on
the
grounds
it
was
paroles
to
do
otherwise
and
that
is
no
different,
than
if
there
were
no
appeal
available
at
all.
mr.
joseph
remcho
no,
it
does
not
because
if
that
is
a
valid
rule,
the
effect
of
upholding
that
rule
is
to
leave
a
statute
which
the
government
of
puerto
rico
itself
concedes
is
not
constitutional
in
full
place
and
in
full
effect.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
think
the
adequate
state
ground
thing
is
somewhat
different.
the
adequate
state
ground
in
the
classic
sense
is
when
there
is
a
constitutional
provision
gives
more
rights
than
the
federal
constitution
allows.
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
a
local
procedural
rule
which
this
is
of
the
state
cannot
be
used
to
foreclose
federal
constitutional
right,
you
did
that
in
chambers
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
the
court
has
in
the
past
with
respect
to
procedural
rules
other
than
even
handed
--
procedure
rules
which
interfere
with
the
vindication
of
federal
constitutional
rights
have
not
stuck
down
in
the
past
by
the
court,
which
have
been
â€“-
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
it
for
my
client;
he
is
facing
three
years
in
jail,
i
agree.
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
right.
with
respect
to
this
habeas
corpus
relief
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
think
that
is
an
open
question.
either
it
is
not
available
because
there
was
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court
or
if
there
was
not
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court,
then
it
seems
to
we
should
prevail
on
our
due
process
ground.
so
i
would
say
that,
habeas
is
only
available
if
we
have
that
full
and
fair
hearing.
if
a
court
says
ultimately
that
it
will
not
entertain
on
habeas
corpus
and
if
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court
on
remand
says,
it
is
still
powerless
to
enter
the
judgment,
then
in
fact
this
statute,
this
public
law
22
will
remain
on
the
books.
even
the
government
thinks
it
is
unconstitutional
and
hopefully
some
members
of
this
court
think
it
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
joseph
remcho
is
not
in
the
effect
of
two
are
the
same?
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
gather
that.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
agree,
i
think
that
would
be
extraordinarily
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
--
difficult,
yes
and
that
is
why
i
think
for
reasons
of
judicial
economy
and
also
because
this
case
has
been
fully
briefed
to
the
court,
that
in
order
to
be
guided
by
the
government's
concession
that
they
do
not
even
think
this
mean
unconstitutional
in
order
to
decide
the
issue.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
i
think
you
can
set
the
judgment
of
conviction
aside
and
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
without
ignoring
what
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
said.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
am
not
sure
that
it
had
no
bearing.
it
did
not
compel
the
result,
one
would
have
thought
just
coming
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
i
would
like
to
see
it
in
the
books.
i
have
the
feeling
you
can
put
it
otherwise
and
still
reverse
that
judgment.
let
me
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
remcho
yes,
if
i
may.
mr.
joseph
remcho
thank
you.
with
respect
to
the
timely
raising
the
petition,
rule
45
(d),
the
rules
in
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
says
that
if
you
file
a
petition
beyond
the
ten-day
period,
then
that
will
be
not
be
granted
unless
it
will
have
no
effect
on
the
--
will
not
be
acted
unless
it
has
no
effect
on
the
mandate
and
in
fact
this
late
petition
was
acted
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico.
they
did
not
say
they
were
denying
it
as
untimely.
they
made
en
banc
and
they
acted
on
that
late
petition.
i
am
also
not
certain
that
there
are
any
decisions
of
this
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
and
denied
it;
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct.
we
relied
there
on
the
due
process
clause
and
we
pointed
out
the
difficulty
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
yes
it
is.
it
is
reprinted
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
appendix
there
at
pages
3a
to
4a
of
the
relevant
sections,
where
it
was
raised
on
due
process
and
also
the
stine
versus
powell
ground
and
of
course
that
carries
with
it,
the
supremacy
clause
grounds
for
example
in
chapman
versus
california,
the
basis
for
decision
there
obviously
was
one
of
the
supremacy
of
federal
rights
over
local
constitutional
procedures,
and
the
court
there
did
not
even
mention
the
supremacy
clause
as
it
is
often
does
not
mention
it,
because
it
is
the
underpinning
of
everything
there
is
with
respect
to
this
court's
actions
over
local
rules.
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct;
there
was
nothing
about
this
being
untimely.
mr.
joseph
remcho
we
do
not
know
that.
we
do
know
that
there
is
an
appellate
procedure,
which
suggests
that
the
court
should
not
file
one,
which
is
out
of
time
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
court
directed
to
file
this
one,
fully
considered
it,
denied
it
on
the
merits.
but
i
think
the
inference
is
that
it
was
heard
on
the
merits,
it
was
heard
en
banc.
mr.
joseph
remcho
because
of
the
section
of
45
(b),
which
states
that
a
petition
for
rehearing
ought
not
to
be
filed
if
it
is
late
by
the
clerk
and
then
there
is
a
certain
inconsistency
between
that
and
45
(d).
mr.
joseph
remcho
yes,
such
we
printed
in
the
governments
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
at
page
7.
mr.
joseph
remcho
yes
the
rule.
mr.
joseph
remcho
yes,
they
are
reprinted.
mr.
joseph
remcho
page
7
of
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm.
mr.
joseph
remcho
sure.
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct,
i
am
not
so
sure
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
oh!
i
think
that
there
is
a
certain
inconsistency
there,
but
the
ohio
case
first
off
is
48
years
of
due
process.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary,
because
the
ohio
had
two
things
this
case
does
not.
first
of
all,
it
was
a
civil
case
and
second,
there
was
already
intermediate
full
appellate
review
in
the
ohio
court,
so
that
case
can
certainly
be
distinguished.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
i
think
that
bond
approval
matters
and
those
were
to
civil
matters
have
historically
been
treated
very,
very
differently
from
the
enforcement
of
federal
constitutions
rights.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
i
think
there
is
a
certain
inconsistency
between
that
and
between
45(d),
which
appears
on
page
7,
which
says
any
motion
for
reconsideration
filed
out
of
the
aforementioned
terms
shall
be
considered
by
the
court
only
to
the
extent
that
it
does
not
effect
the
mandate
and
here
of
course
the
mandate
had
already
been
stayed.
frankly
it
appears
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct,
it
denied
it
but
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct,
but
the
court
did
allow
its
clerk
to
file
that
petition
for
reconsideration
and
it
acted
on
it
en
banc,
which
suggests
that
it
gave
very
stressful
consideration.
thank
you.
