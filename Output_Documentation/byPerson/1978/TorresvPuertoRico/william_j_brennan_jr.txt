justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
case
of
controversy
in
this
court,
in
light
of
the
puerto
rico's
position
in
this
court,
what
is
the
case
of
controversy
over
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
over
the
fourth
amendment,
only
over
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
puerto
rico
is
not
a
state,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
one
of
dissenters
below
now
joined
the
four
majority.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting,
your
client
faces
three
years
in
jail
because
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
affirmed.
therefore,
we
should
completely
ignore
everything
that
was
said
on
the
fourth
amendment
issue
by
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
although
properly
tended
to
them
to
decide
because
they
did
not
decide
it
and
we
should
just
review
the
judgment
of
the
conviction,
and
you
argue
to
set
it
aside
on
the
ground
that
the
fourth
amendment
indeed
was
violated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
obviously
everything
that
was
said
in
your
supreme
court
had
no
bearing
on
the
judgment
that
was
actually
handed,
that
is
affirmance
of
the
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
surely
nothing
that
was
said
on
the
side
of
the
four
support
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
not
much
chance
to
argue
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
get
us
out
of
this
mr.
armstrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you
mr.
armstrong.
are
you
saying
this
that
within
the
10
days
after
this
decision
came
down
in
the
supreme
court,
he
should
have
applied
or
should
have
made
an
allegation,
petition
for
rehearing
or
whatever
it
may
be,
that
as
applied
to
a
case
where
four
thought
the
federal
question
constitutional
question
should
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
accused,
that
not
therefore
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
conviction,
somehow
violated
some
provision
of
the
federal
constitution,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
provision
in
the
federal
constitution
would
you
say
he
had
to
assert,
had
been
violated
by
not
reversing
the
conviction
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
catch
that
mr.
armstrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
i
thought
what
you
told
me
was
that
what
you
should
have
done
was
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
say
that
it
could
not
apply
the
state
constitutional
provision
requiring
five
votes,
because
this
was
a
federal
constitutional
determination
by
four
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
federal
grounds
and
therefore
that
they
could
not
affirm
the
judgment
of
conviction
under
the
state
constitutional,
puerto
rico
constitutional
provision,
but
had
to
reverse
it.
now,
what
is
the
federal
ground
for
that
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
supremacy
clause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
you
say
the
appeal
should
be
dismissed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
appeal
to
this
court
be
dismissed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
armstrong,
does
puerto
rico
have
a
post
conviction
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
federal
habeas
corpus
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
you
do
in
the
federal
district
courts,
but
do
you
in
the
state
courts
have
a
comparable
post
conviction
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
puerto
rico
--
i
keep
following
the
state
never,
but
puerto
rico
is
not
a
state,
but
in
the
puerto
rico
courts,
is
there
a
post
conviction
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
could
--
if
we
cannot
decide
this
case,
may
the
appellant
go
to
a
puerto
rico
post
conviction
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
puerto
rico
habeas
corpus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
supreme
court
en
banc
simply
denied
the
motion,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
we
do
not
know
they
denied
it
as
out
of
time
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
rule
[voice
overlap]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
that
the
rule
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
rule
45?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
page
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
remcho,
i
must
say,
wasn't
this
rule
45
or
rather
[inaudible]
any
motion
for
reconsideration
must,
if
the
aforementioned
term
of
ten
working
days
and
then
in
the
last
sentence,
the
clerk
shall
deny
outright
any
petition
for
extension
to
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration.
