mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
i
will
try,
chief
justice,
and
thank
you
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
main
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
appellant
properly
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
the
issue
that
there
was
a
conflict
meeting
federal
law
and
the
non-reversal
of
the
conviction
on
account
of
the
puerto
rican
constitutional
section
that
binds
probably
on
the
decisions
based
on
local
rule.
in
this
case
the
four
justices,
the
four
judges
who
decided
in
favor
of
reversal,
they
did
not
decide
only
on
the
local
grounds.
they
decided
on
fourth
amendment,
of
fourth
amendment
and
local
article
10
rights.
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
on
the
ohio
versus
akron
park
decision,
the
more
than
simple
majority
requirement
for
wiping
out
a
law,
a
statute
is
reasonable.
so
as
far
as
the
local
law
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
the
decision
is
a
final
and
there
is
nothing
more
toward
the
audit
and
nothing
that
can
be
brought
to
this
court.
it
was
only
apparently
a
decision
on
local
rule.
however,
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
conflict
opened
here.
it
was
a
conflict
between
the
fourth
amendment
right
on
which
the
four
judges'
decision
is
based.
the
federal
basis
of
that
decision
is
the
one
that
probably
opens
a
supremacy
clause
issue
that
properly
raised
before
by
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
could
give
jurisdiction
to
this
court
to
adjudicate
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
case
was
not
that
--
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
was
never
apprised
of
the
existence
of
a
supremacy
clause
conflict.
in
fact,
our
rationale
thinking
is
that
we
want
to
make
clear.
the
appellate
procedure
in
puerto
rico
gives
appellant
ten
days
after
entering
of
judgment
to
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration.
we
agree
we
grant
that,
that
was
the
first
opportunity
that
the
appellant
had
to
raise
the
federal
issue.
that
was
the
first
opportunity
he
had
to
raise
the
supremacy
clause
effect
on
that
constitutional
provision
that
says
that
no
presumably
local
law
can
be
ruled
unconstitutional
except
by
the
absolute
majority
of
the
judges,
composing
the
supreme
court.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
supremacy
clause
conflict
because
that
obviously
refers
to
local
law
issues,
not
to
cases
where,
as
in
this
one,
the
ruling
is
based
on
federal
grounds
besides
the
local
ground.
so
i
believe
that
the
failing
to
put
to
timely
raise
the
issue
before
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico,
appellant
waived
the
right
to
bring
the
case
here.
later
121
days,
say
he
had
first
ten
working
days
to
file
his
motion
for
reconsideration.
in
121
days
of
that
appeal
had
been
proceeded
here,
--
appeal
is
already
in
process.
they
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing,
there
is
something
lurking
in
background
there,
of
all
the
constitutional
supremacy's,
federal
supremacy's.
well
they
believe
that
the
--
these
are
cases
and
appealed
cases,
these
ohio
cases,
slayer
versus
ohio,
riley
versus
ohio
they
state
that
they
were
on
issue,
these
will
be
raised.
it
shall
be
raised
explicitly
with
timeliness
and
in
a
way
that
there
would
be
no
question
that,
that
issue
is
being
raised.
on
implication
of
a
federal
issue
is
not
enough
to
put
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
in
a
position
to
rule
on
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
article
v,
section
4
conflicts
insofar
as
this
case,
it
conflicts
with
the
fourth
amendment
right
of
appellant
and
the
matter
of
refrain
from
original
resurges.
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
never
said
nobody
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
correct
your
honor.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
federal
ground
for
reversal.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
the
federal
ground
was
that
the
reasonable,
probably
unreasonableness
of
the
search.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
the
probable
or
reasonableness
of
the
statute,
of
the
evidences
of
the
search,
on
what
the
evidence
was.
that
was
what
the
four
judges
found
to
be
in
conflict.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
on
federal
grounds.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
because
the
judges
were
bound
by
the
supremacy
clause
which
says
that
they
shall
rule
on
the
federal
law
notwithstanding
any
provision
in
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
state
to
be
contrary.
if
the
man
had
a
four-to-three
acquittal
on
federal
grounds;
on
federal
grounds
that
was
enough
for
acquittal,
but
the
point
was
that,
that
issue
was
never
raised.
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
never
had
the
opportunity
to
decide
on
that
issue
and
that
is
why
we
believe
that
remand
is
now
the
appropriate
remedy.
i
believe
that
this
means
something
because
there
is
no
federal
issue
properly
raised;
there
is
no
federal
question
before
this
court.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
the
appeal
should
be
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
the
appeal
in
this
court
should
be
dismissed,
probably
as
they
are
consolidated
them
on
a
reasonable
grounds
for
a
federal
habeas
because
he
has
been
has
got
that
four-to-three
decision
there.
well,
as
far
as
this
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
has
not
passed
on
the
question
that
this
brought
to
this
court
at
this
time.
so
only
court
decides
that
the
issue,
only
court
decides
whether
or
not
that
absolute
majority
principle
is
binding
in
our
cases,
and
with
our
laws
whether
federal
or
commonwealth.
i
believe
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
has
not
entered
any
decision
with
the
federal
provision,
sufficiently
substantial
to
come
before
this
court.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
no,
that
is
a
matter
of
record.
the
conviction,
the
judgment
is
entered
for
the
reasons
stated
there
that
the
constitution
of
puerto
rico
impeached
any
other
ruling
expect
that
one.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
requires
on
affirmance
of
the
conviction
because
based
on
their
own
concept,
they
cannot
decide
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
because
only
four
judges
out
of
eight
voted
for
the
unconstitutionality.
they
never
had
the
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
supremacy
clauses
because
that
was
never
brought
to
their
attention.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
really
if
it
was
in
the
case
of
that
nixon
versus.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
they
say
that
the
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
powell,
nixon
versus
powell
case,
he
says
that
the
ultimate
goal
of
a
criminal
procedure
is
a
search
for
guilt
or
finding
of
guilt
or
the
decision
on
guilt.
in
this
case,
there
are
no
claims
that
the
appellant
is
innocent.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
he
had
the
right
to
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
ten
days
after
the
judgment
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
they
could
listen
to
the
argument
on
federal
supremacy.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
no,
not
necessarily
but
they
have
to
say
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
they
could
have
said
that
when
the
statute
conflicts
with
federal
law,
the
rule
because
puerto
rican
constitutional
rule
does
not
apply,
that
it
only
applies
to
unconstitutionality
base.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
we
will
be
releasing
in
that
case,
we
have
problem.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
he
will
be
released
if
they
found
that
there
was
a
conflict
that
rendered,
that
they
eliminated
the
bar,
that
these
are
raised
by
this
puerto
rican
constitutional
provision
against
the
clearing
along
constitutional
except
[inaudible]
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
they
should
have
known
what
that
–
the
point
was
not
there
specifically
raised
then.
they
were
looking
at
it
from
the
local
law
standpoint.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
why
he
will
be
in
a
worse?
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
the
same
situation
again.
the
point
is
that
unless
he
raises
the
point
in
the
state,
the
commonwealth,
highest
court
of
appeal
level,
he
cannot
bring
it
to
this
court.
see,
we
are
dealing
with
the
appellate
process.
say
what
you
have
exactly
what
the
state
provides.
it
is
a
matter
of
the
state
deciding
what
is
going
to
be
done
in
there
for
appellant
review
of
the
criminal
provision.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
right.
we
will,
if
they
will
agree
that
they
--
whatever
you
can
do
in
on
appeal
is
a
matter
that
depends
on
what
the
state
grants
you
an
appeal
and
the
puerto
rican
appellate
procedure
includes
that
constitutional
requirement
that
to
declare
it
unconstitutional
absolute
majority
of
the
members
composing
the
court
must
vote
for
a
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
well,
an
absolute
prohibition
like
that
is
i
believe
that
the
--
on
the
certain
circumstances
may
raise
a
compelled
--
some
kind
of
appellant
review.
well,
it
will
be
on
the
federal
question,
not
on
local
law,
because
on
local
law,
he
will
not
have
a
right
to
an
appeal,
but
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
even
if
they
were
no
longer
in
those
circumstances,
he
may
have
a
federal
question
that
he
could
bring
to
this
court.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
nothing
in
the
record
shows
that.
i
think
you
will
see
that
the
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
they
talk
about
the
due
process.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
yes,
the
federal
–
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
they
were
deciding
a
federal
question,
but
when
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
they
left
undecided
a
federal
question,
because
that
federal
question
was
not
brought
to
their
attention.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
post
conviction
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
we
have
federal
habeas
corpus
there
in
the
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
we
have
all
the
due
process
in
the
federal
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
there
are
several
post
conviction
procedures.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
i
do
not
see
why
he
cannot
file
the
habeas
corpus
over
there.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
no,
i
mean
a
puerto
rico
habeas
corpus.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
habeas
corpus.
he
could
then
raise
the
federal
question
there,
not
the
state,
a
puerto
rico
court
decide
this
whether
right
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
i
know
that
at
least
in
the
akron
case,
the
ohio
case,
they
mention
that
the
petition
was
not
timely
filed
and
there
are
other
cases
where
they
said
that
the
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
it
was
not
timely
filed
i
believe
and
i
meant
several
cases
that
could
raise
that
point
conservations
that
--
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
that
is
the
first
opportunity
that
he
has
presenting
the
federal
claim,
he
must
file
–
he
must
present
the
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
roberto
armstrong,
jr.
he
has
not
properly
raised
the
federal
question
down
and
he
cannot
come
here
because
the
question
has
not
been
decided,
has
not
been
put
before
the
court.
there
were
several
cases
out
there.
