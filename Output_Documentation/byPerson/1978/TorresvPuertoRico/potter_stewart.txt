justice
potter
stewart
if
we
agree
with
you
and
apparently
your
colleague
about
the
fourth
amendment
issue,
then
since
we
do
not
have
any
such
"super-majority"
rule
here,
we
would
simply
reverse
the
judgment,
wouldn't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
without
any
reference
to
the
puerto
rico
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
four–to–two?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
in
jail.
