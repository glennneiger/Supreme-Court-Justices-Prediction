justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
the
united
states
put
policemen
on
the
border
between
mexico
and
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
such,
there
is
no
magic
in
the
word
customs,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
and
i
am
talking
about
the
mexican
border
right
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
customs
agents.
could
they
change
their
title
to
policemen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
do
the
same
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
the

have
reversed
the

and
not
violated
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.

this
judgment
must
be
reversed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
are
bound
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
thing
that
really
bothers
me
is

rico
required
to
give
you
an
appeal
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
by
our
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
procedural
rule,
is
it
not
a
procedural
rule.
there
is
a
little
bit
of
substance
here.
the
order
says
and
considering
the
absence
of
the
majority
vote
required
by
constitution's
no
said
act,
the
judgment
is
affirmed,
that
is
not
procedural,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all
we
got,
did
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
you
call
this
procedural?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
we
would
do,
we
would
reverse
the
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
majority
opinion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
could
have
been
done
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
never
foreclosing
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
eight-member
court,

you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
have
anything
in
my
question
that
involve
innocence,
guilt,
or
anything
else.
mine
was,
you
said
these
are
the
files
and
got
petitioned
to
rehearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
that
could
have
been
done
by
the
seven
people
involved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
could
they
have
done
said
that
statute
was
â€“
that
constitution
was
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
could
they
have
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
therefore
is
the
man
released
or
still
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
be
released.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
knew
they
were
dealing
with
a
federal
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
armstrong,
you
said
that
the
supreme
court
did
not
consider
the
federal
right,
i
do
not
see
anything
in
but
federal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
i
am
talking
about
the
opinion
of
the
four
judges,
all
they
talked
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right
of
the
federal
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all
they
talked
about.
they
knew
they
were
deciding
a
federal
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
decided
a
federal
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
court
did
deny
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
say,
they
were
so
agreed
by
the
court
and
say
by
the
clerk?
