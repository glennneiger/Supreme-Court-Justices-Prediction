justice
byron
r.
white
you
won
on
this
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
won
on
this
issue,
the
puerto
rican
supreme
court
agreed
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
i
read
the
brief
of
your
colleague
on
the
bottom
side
of
this
case,
he
does
not
dispute
that
decision
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
so
there
is
no
issue
between
you
on
the
fourth
amendment
or
on
the
ability
to
search
or
on
the
border
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes,
but
then
he
says
that,
that
leaves
only
the
issue,
which
you
want
to
argue
about
the
failure
of
the
court
below
to
give
you
relief
because
of
the
four-three
rule
or
the
majority
rule,
the
"super-majority"
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
would
think
you
would
because
there
is
a
judgment
outstanding
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suppose
this
could
be
an
adequate
state
ground
on
direct
appeal,
but
nevertheless
not
bar
federal
habeas
corpus?
other
things
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
was
decided
that
they
â€“
the
court
below
refused
to
get
you
relief
because
a
majority
of
that
court
did
not
join
in
the
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
a
characteristic
of
local
law,
and
if
we
can
redirect
another
judgment
to
be
entered
by
that
court
unless
we
hold
that
provision
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
a
federal
habeas
corpus
court
can
order
release
because
in
that
event,
there
would
be
no
necessity
to
declare
anything
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
were
right
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
were
quite
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
already
declared
it,
but
they
say
we
have
no
power
under
the
puerto
rican
law
to
reverse
this
judgment;
we
just
do
not
have
that
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
rule
of
the
majority
rule
applies
to
declarations
of
unconstitutionality?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
say
that
it
may
not
satisfy
judgments
for
reasons
of
unconstitutionality?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
not
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
still
could
not
enter
the
declaration?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
just
remand
it
then
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
concession;
that
would
not
change
the
result
if
everybody
stays
for
years
and
they
obey
the
rule
because
the
rule
still
forbid
them
from
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
might
be
true
when
the
lower
court
happen
to
disagree,
but
it
did
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
reason
you
lost
in
the
lower
court
was
because
of
the
local
rule
about
upsetting
a
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right,
they
have
agreed
with
you
on
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
decided
the
appeal,
it
is
affirmed
that
your
client
is,
one
of
my
colleagues
pointed
out
before,
has
a
judgment
of
conviction
outstanding
against
him,
so
that
however,
whatever
the
voting
rules
are
down
there
in
san
juan,
you
lost?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
had
happened
that
your
fourth
amendment
issue
had
not
been
properly
raised
in
the
lower
court
and
the
puerto
rican
supreme
court
said,
we
just
will
not
rule
on
that,
because
you
did
not
raise
it
as
our
rules
require
and
so
we
affirm
the
judgment.
now
if
you
came
here,
we
would
say
that
we
would
deny
or
dismiss
because
of
an
adequate
state
ground,
but
it
would
not
foreclose
you
from
federal
--
would
not
necessarily
foreclose
you
from
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
have
to
talk,
it
would
be
very
hard
for
the
lower
court
to
enter
a
judgment
contrary
to
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
which
has
already
affirmed
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
difficult.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
armstrong,
do
you
have
some
cases
in
this
court
by
any
chance
with
respect
to
this?
suppose
as
in
this
case,
there
is
a
federal
issue
that
does
not
emerge
or
does
not
appear
until
after
the
highest
court
of
the
state
has
decided
the
case,
which
is
true
here
i
gather.
and
under
the
state
procedure
that
new
issue
that
has
emerged
could
be
presented
by
a
petitioner
for
rehearing
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
are
there
some
cases
here
that
say
that
before
the
looser
can
bring
the
case
here,
he
must
file
a
petition
for
rehearing?
is
there
some
cases
here
in
our
courts
that
say
that
he
has
not
presented
the
issue
to
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
ohio
case,
it
was
not
timely
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question,
must
he
present
it
to
the
state
court
on
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
he
does
not,
he
may
not
come
here,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
alright.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
denied
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
presented
the
claim
that
this
constitutional
provision
was
invalid
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
petition
for
rehearing
is
in
the
record
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that
the
inference?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
they
did
deny
it
on
the
merits
and
do
you
want
us
to
say
that
they
were
wrong
in
denying
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
namely,
you
want
us
to
agree
with
you
in
your
petition
for
rehearing
and
declare
that,
that
provision
of
the
puerto
rican
constitution
is
invalid
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
least
but
inconsistent
with
the
ohio
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
really
say
that
we
should
really
upset
the
ohio
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
have
affected
the
mandate
somewhat.
