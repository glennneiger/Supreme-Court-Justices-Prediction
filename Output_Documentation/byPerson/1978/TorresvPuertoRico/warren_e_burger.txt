chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
torres
against
puerto
rico.
i
think
we
will
wait
a
moment
for
the
audience
to
clear.
they
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
interest
in
broadcasting
today.
mr.
remcho,
i
think
you
may
now
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
in
that
you
include
i
take
it
the
power
to
examine
everything
that
comes
in,
just
the
way
customs
agents
do
at
mexican
border
or
anywhere
else,
is
that
what
you
mean
to
embrace
by
indiscriminate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
a
police
officer
or
a
customs
official
or
what
name
you
give
the
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
limiting
that
of
course
to
travelers
from
the
united
states,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
it
follow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
would
have
to
hold
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
have
that
"super-majority"?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
not
a
judgment
outstanding
against
you
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
begin
that
at
1
o'clock.
you
may
continue
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
quite
an
accurate
description
of
that.
if
we
say
that
the
local
rule
of
what
you
have
called
i
think
the
"super-majority"
is
a
valid
rule,
does
that
not
end
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
is
not
in
adequate
state
ground
too,
beside
the
case
is
on,
this
special
majority
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
all
argued.
mr.
armstrong?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah,
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
