justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
so
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
intimated
that
it
agreed
on
the
factual
issue,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
do
you
have
to
delve
very
deeply
into
the
legislative
history
if
the
statute
is
quite
clear
on
its
face?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
different
view.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
walters,
why
does
it
make
any
difference
which
“species
of
fraud,”
as
you
put
it,
he
engaged
in
when
17
(a)
(1)
makes
criminal
the
employment
of
any
device,
scheme,
or
artifice
to
defraud?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
client
wasn't
convicted
of
short
selling,
he
was
convicted
of
fraud.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
concede
that
he
did
engage
in
fraud?
