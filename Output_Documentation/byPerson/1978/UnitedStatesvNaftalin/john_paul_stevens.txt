justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
could
this
case
have
been
prosecuted
under
the
1934
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
have
made
your
position
a
little
easier
here
had
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
was
the
district
judge,
judge
larson?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
walters,
before
you
leave
17
(a),
do
you
concede
that
the
short
sale
was
an
offer
or
sale
of
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
opening
paragraph
of
17
(a)
(1)?
of
7
(a),
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
there
was
no
offer
or
sale
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
--
forget
to
the
broker
for
a
moment,
because
the
statute
doesn't
have
those
in
it.
was
there
in
your
view
an
offer
or
sale
of
any
securities
when
your
client
made
a
short
sale,
representing
it
to
be
a
long
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
concede
there
was
an
offer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
--
so
you
concede
there
was
an
offer
of
sale
of
securities
and
do
you
also
concede
there
was
a
device,
scheme
or
artifice
to
commit
fraud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
concede
there
was
a
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
--
what
your
basic
–
your
statutory
argument
is
that
the
words
“deceit
upon
the
purchaser”
should
be
read
into
the
entire
section?
justice
john
paul
stevens
statutory
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
if
you
read
judge
larson's
opinion,
he
does
refer
to
sale
in
each
paragraph,
and
his
next
to
concluding
paragraph
says
they
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
--
i
have
lost
the
language
now,
but
he
refers
to
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities
and
never
mentions
offer
in
so
many
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
he
clearly
found
fraud
in
the
sale
and
you
are
inferring
that
maybe
also
offer,
but
it
is
not
nearly
as
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
all
events,
doesn't
the
question
whether
it
is
an
offer
or
not
simply
become
a
question
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
quite
clear,
mr.
shapiro?
the
blue
chip
case
holds
that
only
a
purchaser
or
seller
may
sue
for
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
only
if
there
is
an
injury
to
a
purchaser
or
seller
is
the
statute
violated?
it
is
quite
a
different
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
satisfy
that
requirement
here
if
you
find
this
to
be
a
sale?
