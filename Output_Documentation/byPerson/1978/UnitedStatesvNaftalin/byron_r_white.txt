well,
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro,

me
again
--

think

covered
it
in
your
initial
argument

you
lose
this
case,
how
will
the
commission's
operations
be
hurt
or
crippled?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
is
coverage
here,
what
about
private
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
wouldn't
be
if
there
wasn't
coverage
but

justice
byron
r.

you
lost,
there
wouldn't
be,
but
what
if
you
win,
how
about
private
actions,
would
it
necessarily
follow
or
not?
