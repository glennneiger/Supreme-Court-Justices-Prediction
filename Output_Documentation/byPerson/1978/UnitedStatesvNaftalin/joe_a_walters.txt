mr.
joe
a.
walters
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
first
came
before
this
court,
the
government
stated
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
seriously
impairs
the
ability
of
the
united
states
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
enforce
the
securities
laws
in
cases
involving
fraud
practiced
on
the
largest
participants
in
the
national
securities
markets.
they
also
stated
at
page
12
of
their
petition
for
certiorari
that
because
17
(a)
(1)
authorizes
not
only
criminal
prosecutions
but
also
civil
remedies,
the
effect
of
the
decision
here
is
to
abolish
one
of
the
government's
most
effective
weapons
against
the
most
serious
forms
of
securities
fraud
practiced
on
members
of
the
brokerage
industry.
and
by
the
time
we
got
through
briefing
this
matter,
on
page
8
of
the
reply
brief
the
government
says
that
the
fact
that
respondent's
conduct
may
have
violated
other
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
laws
in
addition
to
17
(a)
(1)
is
not
material.
and
counsel
stands
up
today
and
says
that
the
conduct
of
this
respondent
violates
10
(a),
violates
10
(b),
violates
the
mail
fraud
statute,
and
i
might
say
today
violates
section
7
of
the
1934
exchange
act
in
connection
with
7
(c).
now,
having
gotten
into
this
court
--
mr.
joe
a.
walters
i
think
it
makes
this
difference,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
case
would
be
before
this
court
here
today.
this
is
the
first
time
in
over
45
years
of
the
administration
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
that
anyone
has
ever
been
indicted
in
connection
with
what's
called
a
short
selling
scheme,
and
we
maintain
that
there
are
plenty
of
laws
available
in
order
to
corral
this
kind
of
activity
and
that
this
respondent
was
not
properly
charged.
now
--
mr.
joe
a.
walters
now,
that
we're
here
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
that
we
are
here,
that
is
the
issue.
and
i
think
in
determining
that
issue
we
should
remember
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
respondent
was
not
guilty
of
a
violation
of
17
(a)
(1)
because
of
the
species
of
fraud
practiced
by
the
respondent,
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
observation.
what
is
the
species
of
fraud
practiced
by
the
respondent?
they
say
it
is
short
sell,
and
they
say
it
is
defrauding
the
broker
in
that
the
respondent
lied
to
him
and
misrepresented
that
he
had
stock
to
sell
that
he
didn't
then
own.
but
the
species
of
fraud
really
is
the
obtaining
of
illegal
credit
which
when
you're
dealing
with
securities
on
the
national
securities
exchanges
is
regulated
by
section
7
of
the
exchange
act
of
1934.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
it
is
our
contention
that
the
1933
act
was
directed
towards
the
purchaser
of
securities,
that
it
dealt
with
the
offer
or
the
sale
of
securities
to
the
purchasers.
it
dealt
with
the
distribution
of
securities
in
the
marketplace.
whereas,
the
1934
securities
act
dealt
with
the
transactional
situations
in
the
marketplace,
what
was
happening
on
the
stock
exchanges?
and
as
some
of
the
debate
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1933
act
indicates,
there
was
some
disappointment
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
that
the
1933
act
did
not
outlaw
transactional
things
such
as
short
selling,
selling
against
the
box,
washed
sales.
but
they
stated
that
they
realized
you
couldn't
do
it
all
in
one
act,
therefore
the
1934
act
took
care
of
transactions.
now,
what
did
the
1934
act
do?
it
did
not
outlaw
short
selling.
as
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
in
this
case,
short
selling
is
a
common
practice.
often
the
exchange,
in
dealing
with
the
third
market
securities,
the
same
securities
that
are
traded
on
the
exchange,
if
they
are
traded
off
of
the
exchange
short
selling
is
commonly
done,
it
is
a
part
of
business.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
he
was
--
he
was
convicted
of
a
species
of
fraud
and
i
am
directing
the
court's
attention
to
what
is
the
fraud
that
he
committed.
this
is
not
fraud.
he
did
something.
the
fraud
that
he
committed
that
the
law
said
he
shouldn't
do
was
to
get
an
extension
of
credit.
he
obtained
an
illegal
extension
of
credit
from
the
brokers.
that
is
what
he
did.
it
wasn't
short
selling.
that's
not
illegal.
we
are
dealing
with
fungible
commodities
here.
short
selling
is
occurring
all
the
time.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
i
concede
that
he
engaged
in
fraud
in
obtaining
an
illegal
extension
of
credit,
and
i
say
that
that
is
in
violation
of
the
1934
act
and
that
it
is
not
encompassed
within
section
17
(a)
of
the
1933
act.
and
i
direct
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
transaction
that
involves
the
exchange
mechanism,
that
involves
the
very
thing
that
the
1934
act
was
passed
to
regulate,
whereas
the
1933
act
provisions
were
there
for
the
purposes
of
regulating
the
distribution
of
securities.
now,
the
--
as
the
facts
indicate,
not
one
investor
in
any
way
was
injured
as
a
result
of
the
transactions.
the
illegal
extension
of
credit
was
in
effect
what
the
court
found
to
be
the
specie
of
fraud,
as
they
stated
that
the
respondent
took
a
free
ride
on
the
broker's
money
or
credit
and
in
so
doing
violated
the
1934
act.
so
consequently,
in
dealing
with
the
particular
problem
that
we
have
here,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
analyzed
what
species
of
fraud
was
that's
involved
in
this
particular
case,
and
in
addition
in
looking
at
the
1933
act
on
the
one
hand
and
the
1934
act
on
the
other,
recognized
the
charge
that
should
have
been
placed
against
this
respondent
did
not
fall
under
17
(a)
but
rather
fell
under
the
1934
act.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
no,
i
do
not.
i
cannot
--
mr.
joe
a.
walters
there
was
no
offer
or
sale
to
the
broker,
that's
correct.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
my
client
employed
a
broker
to
make
a
sale
of
some
securities.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
through
his
agent,
he
sold
securities
and
they
were
delivered.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
no.
may
i
go
back
for
a
moment
on
the
offer
of
sale?
the
trial
judge,
judge
larson
found
that
there
was
a
sale.
he
never
found
anything
about
an
offer.
so
i
am
not
going
to
concede
there
was
an
offer
because
the
trial
judge
in
his
own
findings
said
no.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
there
was
a
sale
to
a
customer
and
the
securities
were
delivered
to
the
customer
and
the
customer
paid
his
money
for
it
and
the
brokerage
house
that
represented
the
respondent
hung
onto
the
money,
that's
correct.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
that
is
correct.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
i
maintain
that
under
the
1933
act
that
the
deceit
on
the
purchaser
should
be
read
into
subdivision
(1)
and
subdivision
(2)
and
subdivision
(3)
and
i
point
out
that
if
you
look
at
section
12
and
you
look
at
section
11
of
the
1933
act,
you
will
find
it
is
only
the
purchaser
that
has
standing
to
bring
a
cause
of
action
for
fraud,
deception
or
anything
in
violation
of
the
1993
act.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
an
indicator
that
that
should
be
carried
forth
in
17
(a)
provision,
that
it
is
really
the
fraud
on
the
purchaser
in
connection
with
a
sale
that
is
governed
by
this
particular
section,
and
we
have
argued
that
in
our
brief,
that
you
should
re-read
into
it.
now,
counsel
has
made
the
observation
that
the
basis
for
the
17
--
section
17
(a)
was
the
mail
fraud
statute.
according
to
the
research
we
have
done,
it
was
a
combination
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
the
martin
act
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
martin
act
was
the
blue
sky
act
that
new
york
state
had
adopted
and
the
interpretations
of
the
martin
act
by
its
supreme
court
limited
violations
to
purchasers
only,
and
when
the
1933
act
was
written
and
finally
adopted,
it
was
a
combination
of
mail
fraud
and
the
martin
act.
and
i
still
say
that
is
in
keeping,
that
17
(a)
is
still
limited
to
frauds
and
violations
insofar
as
they
direct
its
conduct
towards
the
purchaser.
and
the
conduct
that
the
respondent
here
was
involved
in
was
not
directed
to
the
purchaser
at
all,
it
was
directed
in
fact
to
the
broker
by
way
of
obtaining
illegal
credit
in
violation
of
law,
and
that
law
was
the
1934
act
and
so
if
there
was
a
violation
that
is
where
this
man
should
have
been
charged.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
it
--
it
doesn't,
but
if
you
read
(1)
and
you
read
(2)
and
you
get
down
to
(3)
at
the
end,
it
talks
about
fraud
on
the
purchaser.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
in
interpreting
(1),
(2)
and
(3),
that
they
should
be
read
as
though
there
was
a
fraud
upon
the
purchaser
in
each
case.
i
think
that's
the
only
way
you
give
effect
to
the
statute.
i
think
it
is
clear.
i
mean,
to
me
it
is.
i
realize
we
are
here
on
a
difference
of
opinion
on
that,
but
i
believe
that
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
this
provision.
now,
before
closing
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
a
statement
made
by
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
as
an
effort
to
overcome
the
fact
that
there
was
an
offer
made
which
the
court
found
to
be
in
violation
of
the
law,
and
i
refer
the
court
to
page
3
of
the
government's
reply
brief
in
its
footnote
number
3,
in
which
the
government
does
not
agree
with
the
statement
that
we
made
on
page
18,
footnote
31
of
our
brief,
in
which
we
made
the
observation
that
the
district
court
found
only
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities.
the
court
of
appeals
found
fraud
in
neither
offer
nor
sale,
and
offer
and
sale,
of
course,
are
distinct
acts.
then
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
comes
back
and
says
that
we
are
mistaken
because
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
as
to
each
count
of
the
indictment
the
defendant
acted
as
charged,
and
what
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
which
appear
on
page
28
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
says,
as
to
each
count
of
the
indictment,
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
acted
as
charged
in
the
count
willfully
and
knowingly.
and
i
say
that
that
is
not
a
correct
characterization
by
the
government,
the
court
didn't
find
that
the
respondent
was
found
guilty
of
everything
as
charged.
what
the
trial
court
said
was
that
insofar
as
the
indictment
said
that
what
he
did
was
willful
and
knowingly,
i
find
that
to
be
correct.
and
i
think
that
is
a
far
statement
from
saying
that
this
respondent
was
found
guilty
of
anything
at
all
in
connection
with
the
offering
of
securities
by
the
trial
court,
and,
of
course,
we
are
here
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
thank
you.
mr.
joe
a.
walters
i'm
finished
mr.
chief
justice.
