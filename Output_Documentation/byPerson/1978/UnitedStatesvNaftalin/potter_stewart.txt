justice
potter
stewart
mr.
shapiro,
mr.
walters
just
before
he
sat
down
called
our
attention
to
the
finding
under
paragraph
11
by
judge
larson,
saying
that
as
to
each
count
of
the
indictment,
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
acted
as
charged
in
the
count
willfully
and
knowingly.
what
do
you
suppose
that
last
phrase
means?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
uhmm.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
to
each
count
of
the
indictment,
was
that
charged,
that
it
was
done
willfully
and
knowingly?
justice
potter
stewart
including
the
offer
as
well
as
the
sale?
justice
potter
stewart
the
indictment
appears
on
page?
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
contrast,
this
one
refers
also
to
an
offer.
