mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
eighth
circuit
set
aside
the
district
court's
judgment
which
had
convicted
the
respondent
on
eight
counts
of
securities
fraud
under
section
17
(a)
(1)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
section
17
(a)
(1)
prohibits
frauds
practiced
by
customers
on
their
brokers
during
the
course
of
offering
or
selling
securities.
we
contend
that
section
17
(a)
(1)
applies
to
all
frauds
occurring
during
the
process
of
offering
or
selling,
including
those
frauds
that
injure
brokerage
houses.
the
facts
of
this
case
can
be
summarized
rather
briefly.
in
july
and
august
1969,
the
respondent
placed
sell
orders
with
five
different
brokerage
houses.
those
orders
in
each
case
were
for
large
blocks
of
either
500
or
1,000
shares
of
securities.
the
respondent
had
cash
accounts
with
each
of
these
firms
and
was
not
permitted
to
make
short
sales.
in
each
of
the
sales,
he
either
stated
affirmatively
that
his
position
was
long
or
he
used
words
or
phrases
which
would
indicate
that
his
position
was
long.
in
fact,
however,
respondent
did
not
own
any
of
the
stock
that
he
sold.
his
position
was
short
rather
than
long,
contrary
to
his
representation.
he
planned
to
buy
the
stock
at
some
later
point
in
time
in
the
declining
market
and
to
make
a
delayed
delivery
to
the
brokerage
house.
his
profit
would
be
the
difference
between
the
price
at
which
he
originally
sold
and
the
price
at
which
he
later
covered.
but
contrary
to
his
expectations,
the
price
of
all
of
these
securities
went
up
substantially
and
he
was
unable
to
make
covering
purchases
and
for
that
reason
he
never
delivered
any
of
the
stock
that
he
sold.
under
the
sec's
rules
the
brokers
were
required
to
cover
for
respondent's
sales.
at
first
when
they
were
still
expecting
him
to
make
delivery,
they
forwarded
the
borrowed
securities
on
his
behalf.
when
he
later
confessed
to
the
details
of
this
scheme,
the
brokers
were
required
to
buy
in
the
stock
at
their
own
expense,
resulting
in
substantial
losses.
due
to
respondent's
deception,
the
risk
inherent
in
the
short
selling
scheme
was
shifted
from
himself
to
the
brokers.
because
they
believed
he
was
selling
long,
none
of
them
obtained
a
margin
deposit
that
would
have
protected
them
against
the
failure
to
make
delivery
on
his
part.
the
district
court
found
that
respondent's
misrepresentations
violated
section
17
(a)
(1)
of
the
statute
and
convicted
him
on
all
eight
counts
of
the
indictment.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
respondent
had
committed
fraud
and
had
injured
the
brokerage
houses,
but
it
concluded
that
section
17
(a)
(1)
is
not
violated
by
the
species
of
fraud
which
was
practiced
against
brokers
rather
than
purchasers
of
securities
and
on
that
theory
the
court
reversed
respondent's
conviction
on
all
of
the
counts
of
the
indictment.
we
contend
that
section
17
(a)
(1)
applies
to
the
species
of
fraud
used
here
and
we
rely
on
the
text
of
the
statute
in
making
that
contention.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
could
indeed,
your
honor.
it
might
well
have
been
filed
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
1934
act
because
there
was
fraud
used
in
connection
with
the
sale.
but
a
lot
of
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
don't
feel
that
it
would.
we
think
the
most
logical
choice
for
this
prosecution
was
17
(a)
(1).
a
--
a
fraud
was
used
in
an
offer
and
in
a
sale.
and
as
the
blue
chips
stamps
opinion
points
out,
section
10
(b)
does
not
explicitly
extend
to
frauds
in
an
offer.
the
indictment
here
charged
fraud
in
both
the
offer
and
the
sale
process
and
for
that
reason
section
17
(a)
was
the
logical
choice.
17
(a)
is
the
traditional
criminal
law
provision
used
in
prosecutions
based
on
fraudulent
selling
schemes.
it's
used
in
by
far
the
larger
part
of
the
cases
raising
frauds
in
this
particular
context.
now,
respondent
admittedly
committed
fraud
by
making
statements
of
the
following
kind:
sell
long
1,000
shares
at
market.
when
he
made
that
statement,
he
was
short
rather
than
long
and
we
say
that
this
misrepresentation
occurred
in
a
sale
because
it
was
made
by
the
seller
at
the
very
time
that
he
placed
the
sale.
the
seller
told
a
lie
in
the
very
same
communication
that
triggered
the
contract
of
sale.
the
definitions
in
the
statute
make
that
conclusion
emphatic.
the
statute
says
that
a
sale
includes
every
disposition
of
a
security
for
value,
and
the
dictionary
definition
of
disposition
is
simply
the
action
of
getting
rid
of
something
or
parting
with
something.
now,
giving
these
words
their
ordinary
meaning,
the
respondent
committed
fraud
in
the
disposition
of
securities
when
he
placed
fraudulent
orders
to
sell
those
securities.
the
definition
of
offer
contained
in
the
statute
is
even
more
expansive
than
the
definition
of
sale.
an
offer
includes
every
attempt
to
dispose
of
a
security
for
value.
now,
when
respondent
called
his
brokers
and
ordered
them
to
sell
at
market,
he
was
obviously
attempting
to
dispose
of
securities.
and
since
this
fraud
occurred
while
he
made
that
attempt
to
sell,
we
say
that
the
fraud
occurred
in
his
offer
and
a
violation
of
the
statute
resulted.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
facts
in
the
case
at
all.
it
was
strictly
a
question
of
the
scope
of
section
17
(a)
(1).
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
judge
larson.
a
few
more
thoughts
about
the
literal
text
of
the
statute
may
be
helpful.
section
17
(a)
(1)
nowhere
limits
the
class
of
victims.
it
extends
to
any
scheme
to
defraud,
like
the
mail
fraud
statute,
which
is
the
basis
for
section
17
(a)
(1).
the
victim
can
be
anyone.
indeed,
the
case
law
makes
it
clear
that
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
victim
at
all.
the
scheme
to
defraud
is
itself
illegal
if
it
is
practiced
in
the
protected
medium,
that
is
the
process
of
offering
or
selling
a
security.
and
the
statute
does
not
say
that
the
fraud
must
occur
in
a
particular
phase
of
the
sale
or
in
a
particular
phase
of
the
offer.
the
sale
transaction,
of
course,
consists
of
a
series
of
events.
there
is
the
order
to
sell,
there
is
the
execution,
there
is
the
confirmation,
and
in
the
ordinary
course
there
is
the
delivery
of
securities
and
the
payment
of
money.
but
the
statute
does
not
say
that
the
fraud
must
occur
at
a
particular
point
in
this
process,
and
it
certainly
does
not
say
that
it
must
extend
all
the
way
from
the
seller
through
the
anonymous
exchange
process
to
the
purchaser
on
the
other
side
of
the
transaction.
the
common
sense
of
our
position
is
illustrated,
i
think,
by
a
single
example.
if
a
broker
acting
merely
as
an
agent
committed
a
fraud
on
a
customer
in
the
process
of
selling,
no
one
would
doubt
that
that
was
a
fraud
in
a
sale
within
the
prohibition
of
the
statute.
and
we
say
that
it
makes
no
difference
if
you
turn
the
case
around
and
have
a
case
of
the
customer
defrauding
the
broker.
the
locus
of
the
fraud
is
the
same.
it
still
occurs
in
the
sale
process,
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
for
the
conclusion
that
brokerage
firms
participating
as
intermediaries
in
the
sale
process
are
not
subject
to
the
protections
as
well
as
the
prohibitions
of
section
17
(a)
(1).
the
court
of
appeals,
nonetheless
believe
that
it
was
proper
to
narrowly
construe
section
17
(a)
(1)
because
of
its
view
of
legislative
intent.
the
court
thought
that
congress'
sole
purpose
in
enacting
this
statute
was
to
protect
investors.
we
submit
that
that
ignores
numerous
statements
of
legislative
intent
to
the
contrary
and
it
ignores
the
economic
problem
that
congress
was
attempting
to
grapple
with
in
1933.
this
statute
was
passed
in
the
depths
of
the
depression
as
a
means
to
revitalize
the
economy.
the
market
crash
of
1929
had
left
many
investors
penniless
and
had
practically
wrecked
many
american
business
firms,
in
the
words
of
the
congressmen
who
debated
this
provision.
securities
fraud
contributed
to
these
conditions
and
congress
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
you
don't
have
to
even
scratch
the
surface.
we
think
that
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
directly
support
our
analysis,
but
for
the
sake
of
the
completeness
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
the
legislative
history
pointed
the
other
way
and
we
would
like
to
point
out
it
is
supportive
of
our
position.
congress
intended
to
eliminate
securities
fraud
in
order
to
remedy
the
economic
conditions
that
it
pointed
to
in
the
debates
on
this
measure.
the
beneficiaries
of
that
prohibition
were
explicitly
identified
as
follows,
and
i
quote
from
the
senate
report,
“the
purpose
of
this
bill
is
to
protect
the
investing
public
and
honest
business.”
the
house
report
stated
that
business
injury
was
equally
as
significant
as
the
loss
suffered
by
investors.
in
short,
congress
was
trying
to
protect
the
national
economy
overall,
including
both
public
investors
and
the
business
firms
that
participated
in
our
nation's
economy.
there
is
not
a
hint
in
any
of
the
debates
or
the
reports
that
congress
intended
to
protect
investors
only
or
that
it
was
unconcerned
with
injuries
suffered
by
business
firms.
respondent's
citation
of
legislative
history
showing
that
congress
intended
to
protect
investors
is
quite
beside
the
point,
we
respectfully
submit.
we
would
be
the
first
to
affirm
that
congress
intended
to
protect
investors,
but
we
deny
that
that
was
the
only
purpose
and
respondent
cites
nothing
that
suggests
that
it
was.
in
recent
securities
cases,
such
as
hochfelder
and
blue
chip
stamps
against
manor
drug
stores,
this
court
has
contrasted
the
statutory
provision
under
consideration
with
other
neighboring
provisions
to
get
a
clear
view
on
its
coverage
or
its
scope.
that
technique
is
helpful
here.
section
17
(a)
contains
three
separate
subdivisions.
they
are
each
expressed
in
the
disjunctive
and
each
is
a
prohibition
against
fraudulent
conduct.
section
17(a)
(1)
is
the
broadest
provision,
forbidding
any
fraud
in
an
offer
or
in
a
sale.
section
17(a)
(3),
in
contrast,
is
a
more
limited
provision,
dealing
narrowly
with
fraud
practiced
on
purchasers
of
securities.
this
difference
shows
that
when
congress
intended
to
cover
purchaser
fraud,
it
knew
how
to
do
so
explicitly
and
it
did
do
so
explicitly.
this
court's
decision
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
gilliland,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
opening
and
reply
briefs,
demonstrates
the
proper
analysis
of
this
question.
in
that
case,
the
court
considered
a
provision
in
the
criminal
code
which
prohibited
the
filing
of
any
false
report
with
a
government
agency.
in
the
same
sentence,
and
stated
in
the
disjunctive,
was
a
prohibition
against
filing
any
false
claim
or
bill
or
voucher
demanding
money
from
the
government.
the
defendant
there
made
the
same
argument
that
the
defendant
makes
here,
that
the
general
prohibition
should
be
circumscribed
by
the
narrower
prohibition.
this
court
rejected
that
argument
in
words
that
are
directly
applicable
here,
and
i
quote:
“the
rule
of
ejusdem
generis
is
a
familiar
and
useful
one.
but
it
gives
no
warrant
for
narrowing
alternative
provisions
which
the
legislature
has
adopted
with
the
purpose
of
affording
added
safeguards.”
that
principle,
we
submit,
is
directly
applicable
here.
section
17
(a)
(1)
and
17
(a)
(3)
are
alternative
prohibitions
which
taken
together
provide
comprehensive
protection
against
fraud,
and
there
is
no
justification
for
contracting
these
complementary
provisions
into
a
single
narrow
prohibition
dealing
only
with
fraud
on
purchasers.
respondent
is
perfectly
candid
in
the
position
that
he
takes
about
the
fraud
in
this
case.
he
doesn't
deny
that
he
committed
fraud.
he
doesn't
deny
that
he
injured
the
brokerage
houses.
and
he
doesn't
even
deny
that
he
violated
the
federal
securities
laws.
he
contends,
however,
that
the
prosecutor
made
a
mistake,
that
the
prosecutor
was
duty-bound
to
pursue
him
under
section
10
of
the
1934
act,
rather
than
section
17
of
the
1933
act.
but
as
i
mentioned
previously
to
mr.
justice
blackmun,
17
(a)
(1)
was
not
only
an
allowable
choice,
it
was
the
most
logical
choice.
it
deals
squarely
with
the
thing
charged
in
the
indictment,
fraud
in
an
offer
and
fraud
in
a
sale.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
by
this
analysis
that
respondent
did
not
transgress
various
different
provisions.
i
assume
that
he
did.
i
think
he
violated
section
10
(b)
when
he
used
fraud
in
connection
with
a
sale.
i
think
he
violated
section
10
(a)
when
he
caused
a
short
sale
to
be
effected
in
a
declining
market,
contrary
to
the
sec's
rules,
and
i
think
he
probably
violated
the
mail
fraud
statute
because
he
used
a
fraudulent
scheme
and
caused
the
mails
to
be
used
in
conjunction
with
it.
but
it
is
quite
commonplace
for
a
complex
criminal
scheme
to
run
afoul
of
different
statutory
provisions,
and
when
it
does
this
court's
decisions
teach
that
the
discretion
rests
with
the
prosecutor
to
select
the
appropriate
charge
and
that
is
a
broad
discretion
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
respondent
has
also
argued
that
the
decision
below
must
be
affirmed
because
criminal
laws
should
be
construed
with
lenity,
but
the
rule
of
lenity
applies
to
statutes
that
contain
serious
ambiguities
which
do
not
afford
fair
notice
to
the
accused.
this
statute
clearly
conveys
the
congressional
purpose.
this
statute
speaks
in
sweeping
terms.
it
prohibits
any
device,
any
scheme
or
any
artifice
of
fraud
used
directly
or
indirectly
in
an
offer
or
in
a
sale.
no
person
reading
that
statute
could
think
that
he
was
free
to
pick
up
the
telephone
and
call
his
broker
and
deceive
his
broker
in
the
process
of
selling
a
security,
and
there
is
no
question
here
but
that
the
deceit
that
was
practiced
was
willful
and
knowing.
the
district
court
found
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disagree
about
the
clarity
of
the
evidence
showing
fraud.
under
these
circumstances,
we
submit
that
the
rule
of
lenity
simply
has
no
application.
for
these
reasons
and
those
that
we
have
expressed
in
our
opening
and
reply
briefs,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
ask
your
leave
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
reply.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
just
briefly,
your
honor.
i
think
the
last
sentence
in
the
district
court's
opinion
bears
mention.
it
says
that
the
court
finds
the
defendant
guilty
of
each
count
in
the
indictment
and
each
count
of
the
indictment
explicitly
charged
fraud
in
an
offer
and
fraud
in
a
sale.
the
statutory
definition
of
an
offer
is
simply
an
attempt
to
dispose
of
a
security
for
value.
the
evidence
here
showed
that
there
was
an
attempt.
that
was
the
only
purpose
of
calling
the
broker
and
telling
him
to
sell
the
shares.
we
think
that
this
finding
of
the
district
court
is
sufficient
to
establish
that
there
was
fraud
used
in
an
offer
as
well
as
a
sale.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that's
quite
correct.
he
paraphrased
the
statute
in
terms
of
a
completed
sale,
but
in
the
process
of
making
a
completed
sale
there
was
an
attempt
to
dispose
of
the
security
and
we
think
that
that
is
necessarily
embraced
within
this
finding.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
certainly
is,
and
this
court
could
affirm
or
reinstate
a
correct
district
court
judgment
on
any
applicable
legal
theory.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
willfully
and
knowingly?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
necessary
to
sustain
a
conviction
under
i
believe
it
is
section
24
of
the
act
that
requires
scienter.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
that
was
the
reason
for
stating
that
he
acted
as
charged
in
a
willful
manner
and
a
knowing
manner.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
believe
that
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
think
that
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
pages
14
through
15.
the
--
the
very
beginning
of
the
paragraph
under
neal
t.
naftalin,
defendant
here,
willfully
and
knowingly
did
employ
a
scheme
to
defraud,
and
then
it
proceeds
to
describe
the
acts
that
constituted
that
fraud,
stating
that
this
was
in
the
offer
and
sale
of
securities,
on
page
15,
and
that's
repeated
with
respect
to
each
count
of
the
indictment.
this
argument
was
made
that
the
misconduct
here
was
simply
obtaining
credit
illegally,
and
i
think
that
bears
pump
rebut
--
rebuttal
to
buy
out
the
--
the
basis
of
the
charge
here
was
fraud,
a
misstatement
of
the
seller's
position.
the
obtaining
of
credit
was
only
the
context
in
which
the
fraud
took
place.
the
basis
of
the
indictment
was
misrepresentation.
the
argument
was
also
made
that
the
1933
act
deals
only
with
fraud
in
new
issues.
that
--
that
proposition
is
easy
to
rebut
by
examining
any
of
the
cases
contained
in
the
annotations
under
section
17
(a).
fully
two-thirds
to
three-quarters
of
these
cases
are
cases
involving
fraud
in
the
after-market.
17
(a)
(1)
applies
to
fraud
in
any
sale
or
in
any
offer,
not
just
in
new
distributions
of
securities.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
a
practical
consequence
to
the
choice
between
17
(a)
and
section
10
(b).
17
(a)
covers
fraud
in
an
offer
as
well
as
fraud
in
a
sale.
section
10
(b)
doesn't
extend
that
far.
for
example,
if
fraud
was
used
here
in
placing
a
limit
order
or
a
stop
loss
order
that
wasn't
executed
on
the
exchange.
it
couldn't
--
it
couldn't
be
affected
on
the
exchange,
and
deception
was
used
in
that
attempt
to
dispose
of
a
security,
which
would
violate
section
17
(a)
but
it
wouldn't
violate
section
10
(b).
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
right.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
i
--
i
think
that
part
of
the
court's
analysis
in
blue
chip
referred
to
the
fact
that
section
10
(b)
speaks
only
of
fraud
in
connection
with
a
purchase
or
a
sale.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
offer
and
a
sale,
and
that
is
the
practical
difference
that
justice
white
was
driving
at.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
court
has
never
decided
whether
there
is
a
private
action
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
don't
think
that
it
would
necessarily
follow
that
there
would
be
a
private
action.
this
--
as
the
court
has
pointed
out,
this
is
a
judicial
construct
based
on
a
number
of
different
considerations
and
the
court
has
looked
to
various
different
factors
in
trying
to
decide
whether
an
implied
private
right
should
exist.
this
is
an
express
criminal
law
provision
that
we
are
relying
on
here.
we
are
not
relying
on
any
judicially
implied
right
of
action.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
will
conclude
my
argument.
thank
you.
