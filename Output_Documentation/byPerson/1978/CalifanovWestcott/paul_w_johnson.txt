mr.
paul
w.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
paul
johnson.
i'm
an
assistant
attorney
general
representing
the
commissioner
of
the
massachusetts
department
of
public
welfare.
the
commissioner
has
only
appealed
from
the
district
court's
remedy
for
the
defect
which
it
found
in
section
407.
this
appeal
raises
a
fundamental
question
concerning
the
balance
to
be
struck
between
equity
powers
of
the
federal
courts
and
the
separations
of
power's
principle.
the
district
court
elected
to
extend
section
407
under
inclusive
class
in
order
to
salvage
the
afdc-uf
program.
while
this
decision
to
extend
the
class
was
correct,
the
district
court
extended
the
class
too
far.
the
district
court
rewrote
section
407
such
that
the
unemployment
of
either
parent
would
qualify
the
family
for
benefits
even
though
the
family's
principal
wage
earner
was
still
employed.
under
this
remedy,
a
parent
who
had
been
only
a
casual
member
of
the
labor
force
could
trigger
benefits
by
his
or
her
unemployment.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
we
incorporated
united
states'
arguments
before
the
district
court.
we
have
not
appeal
from
the
district
court's
ruling.
we
have
no
objection.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
we
have
no
objection
to
the
district
court's
ruling
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
provision
(voice
overlap)
of
the
congress.
just
the
remedy
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
well,
we
get
reimbursed
to
a
50%
rate,
your
honor.
so,
the
gross
spend
out
by
the
state
does
go
up
of
course
and
dramatically
in
the
case
of
the
remedy
ordered
by
the
district
court.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
yes,
your
honor
it
would.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
it
would
be
a
less
expensive
program,
your
honor.
contrary
to
the
district
court's
ruling,
section
407
legislative
history
demonstrates
the
congressmen
to
assist
only
those
families
whose
principle
wage
earner
had
become
unemployed.
this
legislative
goal
is
the
critical
fact
in
this
case.
the
judicial
power
to
extend
and
under
inclusive
class
depends
upon
an
implied
grant
of
power
from
congress
to
recast
its
programs
in
a
unconstitutional
form.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
that
was
the
district
court's
remedy,
your
honor.
it
simply
attempted
to
--
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
the
present
practice
is
not
less
beyond
--
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
your
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
yes
your
honor,
but
that
rather
straight
forward
attempt
to
extend
to
extend
the
statutory
classification,
ignores
the
fact
that
1967
congress
at
it's
level
made
a
decision
that
families
would
not
get
benefits
simply
because
the
mother
whom
congress
assumed
to
be
a
secondary
--
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
but
congress
has
always
meant
the
afdc-u
program.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
yes,
your
honor,
but
in
order
to
fashion
a
remedy
which
stays
true,
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
but
a
remedy
--
the
remedy
of
extension
finds
its
fountain
of
justification
in
what
congress
would've
done
if
they
had
known
that
the
program
is
written
was
incorrect.
what
congress
meant
to
do
at
bottom
was
to
establish
a
program
for
families
whose
principal
wage
earner
had
been
knocked
out
of
labor
market.
congress
traditionally
assumed
that
that
principal
wage
earner
was
the
father.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
that
practice
has
been
tolerated
by
the
congress,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
well,
statute
simply
says
the
father's
--
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
--
unemployment.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
but
the
legislative
reports
in
1967
when
that
term
came
in
specifically
said
the
reason
for
this
was
because
states
had
abused
the
term
“parent”
by
providing
benefits
to
families
where
the
mothers
are
unemployed
even
though
that
principle
wage
earner,
the
presumed
principle
wage
earner
the
father
was
still
working.
congress
specifically
reacted
to
that
syndrome
of
allowing
a
secondary
wage
earner
to
trigger
benefits
by
unemployment.
that,
i
think
when
you
strip
away
the
sex
characteristics
that
congress
used
to
define
these
economic
terms
is
the
underlying
intent
of
congress.
if
you
consider
a
program
that
provides
benefits
when
a
secondary
or
even
a
casual
wages
earner
is
knocked
out
at
the
labor
market
that
is
a
great
step
forward
from
the
limited
goal
which
congress
sought
in
1961,
1962,
and
1967
to
achieve
what
was
simply
to
help
families
whose
principal
wage
earner,
their
economic
means
that
have
a
knock
out
of
that
employment
market.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
your
honor,
i
think
that
may
highlight
the
fact
that
the
commissioner
differs
tremendously
with
the
secretary
and
the
solicitor
general
on
his
reading
of
legislative
history.
the
solicitor
general
has
retreated
to
the
concept
that
the
only
purpose
of
afdc-u
was
to
kept
fathers
from
leaving
the
home,
a
prophylactic
against
the
defect
in
the
afdc
structure.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
pardon?
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
say
the
a
fundamental
reason
that
congress
enacted
this
program,
and
my
brief
bares
this
out
in
terms
of
legislative
history
was
to
get
benefits
out
of
families
whose
principal
wage
earner
had
been
laid
off.
when
president
kennedy
came
into
office
in
1961,
he
found
the
tremendous
recession
and
institute
two
major
programs
right
after
that
to
extend
that
employment
compensation
and
to
provide
benefits
to
wage
earners
who
couldn't
find
jobs.
the
concept
was
one
of
the
equality
of
treatment
why
should
a
child
whose
father
sits
at
home
because
his
employer
is
shut
down
be
any
less
needy,
any
less
where
the
benefits
in
a
father
--
than
a
child
whose
father
has
simply
walked
out
the
door,
the
idea
was
to
take
care
of
children
whose
wage
earners
had
been
let
down
by
the
economy.
this
is
what
afdc-u
was
generated
to
do.
in
short,
the
district
court's
remedy
has
two
flaws,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
it
over
steps
the
limits
which
congress
set
for
afdc-u
program.
as
a
matter
of
equity,
its
remedy
exceeds
the
scope
of
the
constitutional
wrong
which
it
would
remedy.
a
principal
wage
earner
remedy
that
advocated
by
the
commissioner
would
assist
every
family
whose
principal
wage
earner
whether
male
or
female
is
an
unemployed.
that
is
a
complete
remedy
and
more
accurately
preserves
the
congressional
conception
of
the
afdc-u
program
which
i
discussed
with
justice
stewart
and
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
the
secretary
in
its
brief
now
attempts
to
buttress
the
district
court's
remedy
from
another
direction.
he
asserts
that
his
power
to
define
unemployment
by
this
court
from
adopting
the
principal
wage
earner
remedy
even
if
that
remedy
more
accurately
reflects
the
intent
to
congress.
secretary's
argument
misreads
section
407,
it
must
be
rejected.
turning
first
to
legislative
history
and
quite
briefly
because
i've
discussed
it,
the
key
when
the
commission
is
i
to
this
case
is
what
congress
meant
when
it
selected
the
father
as
the
parent
who
must
be
unemployed.
congress
identify
the
principal
wage
earners
whose
unemployment
would
impoverish
their
families
as
fathers,
purged
to
this
sex
bias
only
the
legislative
focus
upon
the
family's
principal
wage
earner
remains.
substitution
of
the
term
“principal
wage
earner”
for
term
“father”
would
preserve
the
legislative
purpose
to
assist
those
families
whose
true
bread
winners
were
unemployed
no
more
and
no
less.
turning
to
the
secretary's
argument,
the
plane
language
of
section
407
rebuts
the
secretary's
assertion
the
only
he
has
the
power
to
adopt
the
principal
wage
earner
remedy.
the
secretary
now
points
to
exclusive
discretion
under
section
407
to
define
unemployment.
section
407
defines
an
eligible
family
in
terms
of
and
i
quote,
“the
unemployment
has
determined
in
accordance
with
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
its
father.”
section
407
only
authorizes
the
secretary
to
define
unemployment.
it
does
not
authorize
him
to
redefine
term
“father.”
these
two
terms
expressed
very
different
concepts
unemployment
is
a
relative
notion
subject
to
empirical
definition.
a
definition
appropriately
left
to
administrative
discretion
on
ongoing
basis.
congress'
choice
of
the
term
“father”
on
the
other
hand
represents
a
policy
judgment
as
to
which
families
should
be
entitled
to
benefits.
the
commissioner
argues
those
families
whose
principal
wage
earner
has
been
knocked
out
of
the
labor
force.
in
order
to
reaffirm
the
limits
on
the
judicial
ability
to
rewrite
legislation,
this
court
should
reverse
the
remedy
ordered
by
the
district
court
and
put
the
principal
wage
earner
remedy
in
it
instead.
thank
you
very
much.
