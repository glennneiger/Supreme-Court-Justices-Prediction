mr.
alsup,
is
“impact”
a
verb?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
alsup,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
the
district
court
did
certify
this
case
as
a
class
action,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
did
define
the
class
as
all
massachusetts
families
who
would
be
eligible
for
the
afdc-uf
and
therefore
medicate
benefits
except
for
the
requirement
407
that
the
unemployed
parent
be
a
father?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
yes,
it's
the
relief
that
granted
and
its
decision
really
went
far
beyond
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
get
reimbursed
with
regards
of
how
it
comes
out
on
that
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
reversal
on
the
federal
appellant's
appeal
moot
your
client?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
your
argument
boil
down
all
to
at
what
point
you
slice
this
thing
so
to
speak?
did
you
determine
intent
as
of
1935
or
as
of
1967?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
are
arguing
is
the
overall
purpose
of
afdc
program
which
i
understood
was
adopted
in
1935?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
telling
us
that
there
is
something
to
this
court
knows
that
congress
didn't
know
about
what
its
purpose
was
in
1967?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
say
the
purpose
of
congress
in
1967
was
when
did
enact
this
as
reflected
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
where
legislative
history
is
not
clear
you're
not
free
to
look
at
language
of
the
statue
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
freedman,
isn't
that
somewhat
inconsistent
with
your
use
of
the
word
“archaic”
if
in
your
view
the
congress
had
used
correct
perceptions
of
male
and
female
roles
in
1935
and
1961
and
1962?
isn't
that
a
little
ironic
that
all
of
a
sudden
67
years
after
those
dates,
it
all
of
a
sudden
reverted
to
what
you
described
as
archaic
notion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
denied
that
opportunity
by
whom
the
pennsylvania
legislative?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
doesn't
the
state
and
invariably
want
the
broadest
possible
option
in
terms
of
invalidation
and
if
it's
purely
optional
with
the
state
and
if
it's
just
a
question
how
much
extra
federal
money
of
the
state
can
pick
up?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
statute.
the
1967
amendment
has
been
invalidated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
a
court
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
court?
