mr.
henry
a.
freedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
under
section
407
of
the
social
security
act,
appellees
are
denied
desperately
needed
cash
and
medical
benefits
for
one
reason
and
one
reason
only.
the
parent
and
the
family
whose
unemployment
cause
the
destitution
is
female.
these
families
are
just
as
needy
as
those
who
received
benefits.
the
female
parent
has
extensive
of
work
history
and
does
has
willing
to
comply
with
work
requirements
as
the
male
parent
whose
unemployment
qualifies
the
family
for
benefits.
the
problem
with
the
appellee
families
apparently,
is
that
the
mother
for
reasons
of
circumstance
or
of
choice
does
not
conform
to
traditional
stereo
types
and
is
or
has
been
a
family
breadwinner,
but
only
traditional
that
is
male
bread
winners
can
qualify
family
for
afdc-u
benefits.
the
gender
discrimination
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
more
onerous
than
that
what
this
court
has
encountered
in
any
prior
gender
discrimination
cases
because
of
a
combination
at
work
here.
first,
subsistence
benefits,
benefits
needed
for
survival
are
being
denied
and
secondly,
the
act
imposes
an
absolute
bar
to
receive
to
those
benefits
rather
than
simply
applying
a
further
test
under
which
a
showing
must
be
made
such
as
a
test
of
dependency.
since
there
is
gender
discrimination
in
this
case,
the
test
to
be
applied
as
this
court
most
recently
reiterated
in
orr
versus
orr
last
month
is
that
the
gender
classification
must
serve
important
governmental
objectives
and
be
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
those
objectives.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that's
correct
your
honor
that
was
in
a
case
involving
claim
between
parties.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
there
might
be
somewhat
more
division
it
is
still
clear
that
the
orr
decision
was
applying
to
test
that
it
previously
been
applied
by
this
court
in
califano
versus
webster,
califano
versus
goldfarb
cases
involving
the
social
security
act.
so,
government
benefits
have
been
tested
under
the
same
standard
by
this
court.
in
seeking
to
avoid
the
effect
of
this
test
however,
the
solicitor
general
particularly
in
his
brief
has
argued
that
there
was
one
objective
really
and
one
objective
only
for
the
afdc-u
program.
and
that
was
to
encourage
fathers
not
parents
not
the
father
or
the
mother
but
just
the
father
to
remain
in
the
home.
but
as
the
state
has
also
argued
the
overriding
objective
of
the
afdc-u
program
through
out
its
history
has
been
to
meet
needs
of
children
cause
by
unemployment
of
parent.
and
that
objective
is
of
course
totally
unserved
by
the
gender
classifications
to
this
(voice
overlap).
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
for
purpose
of
this
case
we
would
argue
it
doesn't
matter
as
of
what
you
determine
there
it.
there
were
really
two
years
here
were
decisions
were
made
with
regard
to
the
afdc-u
program.
the
first
was
in
1961
when
the
program
was
created
and
then
was
clearly
sex
neutral.
if
no
change
has
been
made
1967,
the
westcott
family,
the
westwood
family
would
have
qualified
for
benefits.
so,
what
we
have
here
is
a
cutback
made
in
1967.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
is
correct
and
the
afdc-u
program
is
a
sub-program
clearly
sub-program
of
the
afdc.
afdc
was
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
dependent
children.
afdc-u
was
added
in
1961
to
expand
the
class
of
dependent
children
whose
needs
were
going
to
be
met
by
the
program
namely
to
include
the
children
of
the
unemployed
and
that
definition
of
the
dependent
child
has
been
maintained
in
the
afdc-u
program
until
the
state,
the
dependent
child.
the
child
qualifying
for
benefits
of
the
program
is
the
child
deprived
of
parental
supporter
care
by
reason
of
the
unemployment
and
it
was
just
the
word
of
strange
in
1967
was
unemployment
of
a
father
instead
of
unemployment
of
the
parent.
the
clearly,
the
purpose
reflective
by
the
statutory
language
and
by
the
legislative
history
through
out
was
to
meet
a
need
cause
by
an
unemployment.
indeed
in
1967
former
hew
secretary
ribicoff,
now
senator
ribicoff
has
stated
that
a
child
can
be
just
as
hungry
if
a
parent
is
unemployed
as
a
parent
is
dead
absent
or
incapacitated.
indeed,
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
is
there
any
statement
or
any
reflection
that
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
afdc-u
program
to
meet
needs
was
being
rejected
or
abandoned
or
even
diminished
by
congress.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
indeed
it
was.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
but
nowhere
did
congress
say
we
are
cutting
back
on
the
program
because
we
believe
they
are
needy
children
whose
needs
we
don't
want
to
meet.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
it
certainly
did.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that's
correct
and
but
we're
trying
to
discern
is
why
the
congress
cutback
on
the
program.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
it
had
power
to
act.
the
question
is,
is
why
they
did
act.
under
the
test
that
we're
applying
today
the
court
has
set
out
for
itself
the
test
to
determine
was
the
actual
purpose
of
the
gender
classification.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
not
at
all
with
this
court
has
to
do
is
to
read
the
act
which
tells
us
that
the
purposes
to
aid
dependent
children
and
then
look
at
legislative
of
history
and
attempt
to
discern
why
wasn't
that
congress
made
the
change
that
it
did
in
1967
and
then
does
the
gender
classification
substantially
served
that
purpose
and
when
we
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
1967
as
i
was
saying
refined
no
indication
that
there
was
desire
to
move
away
from
needs
meeting
purpose
and
move
as
the
solicitor
general
argues
to
an
anti-paternal
desertion
purpose
what
we
do
far
is
that
the
debate
was
pervaded
by
sex
stereo
typing
that
the
words
“father
and
parent”
were
used
interchangeably
without
any
indications
or
sense
that
something
different
was
being
said.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
we
would
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
introduction
of
the
gender
classifications
was
consistent
with
the
general
concern
that
congress
had
in
1967
as
regard
to
afdc-u
program
that
some
states
were
qualifying
families
for
benefits
on
the
basis
of
the
so-called
unemployment
of
a
family
member
who
they
assume
to
be
homemaker,
the
housewife
when
that
person
really
had
no
prior
task
into
the
workforce
and
was
not
the
type
of
person
whom
congress
saw
as
unemployed
who
was
losing
income
and
therefore
someone
who
created
the
need
that
congress
was
to
meet.
congress
addressed
this
in
several
ways.
it
addressed
it
by
adding
a
primary
attachment
to
the
work
force
task.
but
it
would
seem
that
in
terms
of
the
stereo
difficult
thinking
that
the
real
wage
earner
in
the
family
is
the
father
and
that
the
mother
is
basically
person
who
stays
at
home
but
a
way
of
nailing
down
that
decision
was
to
deny
a
whether
there
was
unemployed
mother.
now,
we
don't
really
know
because
that
the
problem
we
have
here
is
that
the
legislative
history
is
generally
so
uninformative.
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
no
one
claims
that
the
purpose
was
being
changed.
no
one
attached
real
significance
to
this
change.
rather
they
spoken
terms
of
the
type
of
the
stereo
types
which
this
court
is
consistently
rejected
such
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
not
on
the
list,
not
on
the
list
the
argument
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
demonstrates
concern
about
need
caused
by
deprivation
and
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
that
the
purpose
here
was
to
deter
desertion
and
we
looked
at
the
language
of
the
statute
and
no
where
do
we
see
any
discussion
of
that.
that
is
why
we
suggest
that
it
is
valid
to
look
at
legislative
history.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
the
deterrence
of
desertion?
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
not
all.
we
find
it
quite
easy
to
find
in
the
legislative
history
with
regards
to
other
sections
of
the
afdc
program
which
were
enacted
specifically
to
address
the
question
of
desertion.
in
fact,
in
taking
the
action
that
congress
took
in
the
social
security
amendments
of
1967,
the
bill
that
we're
addressing
here
today
both
committee
reports
had
a
heading.
one
heading
that
said
afdc-u
program
and
another
heading
that
said
desertion.
and
under
the
heading
desertion,
two
provisions
were
discussed,
one,
to
strengthen
the
child
support
program
under
which
states
would
identify
and
pursue
absent
parents
for
child's
supports;
and
the
other
to
impose
a
so-called
afdc
freeze
under
which
federal
reimbursement
to
the
states
there
will
be
cut
on
federal
reimbursement
to
the
states
for
absent
parent
cases
so
that
if
the
states
absent
parent
case
load
increase
there
will
be
no
further
federal
funding.
congress
made
it
clear
that
the
reason
for
this
was
to
store
the
states
into
action
to
do
something
about
desertion
to
improve
their
family
services,
to
strengthen
the
child
support
program
but
in
both
of
those
instances
and
which
congress
explicitly
addressed
the
question
of
desertion
it
did
so
clearly
in
a
sex
neutral
matter
in
terms
of
the
legislation.
there
is
no
indication
that
it
was
a
less
concern
about
a
mother
deserting
family
than
about
a
father
deserting
a
family.
and
clearly
if
congress
had
such
an
anti-desertion
objective
related
to
the
afdc-u
program
it
too
would've
been
sex
neutral
and
of
course
the
gender
discrimination
would
not
bear
fair
and
substantial
relationship
to
such
an
objective.
the
solicitor
general
to
be
noted
has
made
no
attempt
to
defend
to
the
gender
discrimination
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
general
congressional
desire
to
maintain
family
stability
or
to
deter
desertion.
moreover,
we
would
want
to
point
out
that
the
solicitor
general
has
this
morning
relied
almost
entirely
upon
the
1961
and
1962
history
the
act
when
the
act
was
clearly
sex
neutral
where
an
unemployed
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
at
1961
for
one
day.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
we
certainly
would
your
honor
for
at
least
two
reasons.
one
would
be
that
it's
concern
was
to
deter
desertion
of
fathers
as
justice
stevens
noted
before
it
simply
doesn't
work
that
way
if
the
cases
in
which,
cases
such
as
a
plaintiff's
cases
in
which
it
was
the
mother
who
became
unemployed
are
still
cases
and
which
there's
the
father
or
the
mother
as
the
cases
from
the
father
becomes
unemployed.
the
father
or
the
mother
will
be
in
a
position
where
the
family
can
only
qualify
for
benefits
if
one
of
the
parents
leaves
home.
we
should
note
in
response
the
question
before
that
indeed
in
this
case
billy
westcott
although
his
landlord
suggested
that
he
leave
home
in
order
to
qualify
the
family
for
afdc
benefits
and
able
to
pay
the
landlord
rent
but
he
didn't
not
found
rather
the
family
went
out
benefits
until
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
there
was
an
equivalent
incentive
for
the
mother
to
leave
home
and
the
point
is
that
there
is
no
gender
discrimination.
the
afdc-u
--
the
afdc
program
in
1935
(voice
overlap)
until
the
present
time
has
not
drawn
a
distinction
on
basis
itself.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
unless
one
was
incapacitated
of
course
as
you
pointed
out
before.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
you
are
right
that
the
eligibility
is
based
upon
there
being
a
parent
absent.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
is
correct.
we
would
not
agree
that
that
was
the
problem
that
congress
was
addressing
in
1961.
we
believe
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
overwhelming
problem
that
congress
was
addressing
in
1961
was
that
there
were
needy
two-parent
families
out
there
at
this
point
of
recession
who
are
not
eligible
for
benefits
and
who
desperately
needed
benefits
and
as
purpose
of
the
program
as
the
legislative
history
shows
through
out
is
to
meet
the
needs
of
these
children.
it
was
also
noted
that
this
would
have
the
desirable
effect
of
eliminating
an
incentive
that
was
precedes
in
the
existing
afdc
program.
there
are
those
who
argue
in
congress
that
there
was
no
such
incentive
to
desert
that
indeed
states
had
general
assistance
program
which
often
provided
for
these
families.
they
were
certainly
the
skeptics.
they
said
this
was
not
the
purpose.
everyone
did
agree
that
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
that
the
overwhelming
purpose
at
least
was
to
meet
needs
was
to
provide
for
families
who
otherwise
not
receiving
benefits
or
who
were
receiving
inadequate
benefits
under
state
plans
or
who
exhausted
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
we
do
not
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
the
motivation
of
the
committees
who
adopted
this
legislation
as
the
congress
has
adopted
that
the
motivation
was
affected
in
any
significant
way
by
concern
about
desertion
real
or
synthetic.
but
it
clearly
was
discussed
and
certainly
our
case
doesn't
turn
upon
rejecting
that
is
a
purpose
where
is
the
solicitor
general's
case,
at
least
the
way
the
brief
has
been
represented,
turns
upon
his
establishing
that
there
was
no
purpose
related
to
meeting
need.
it
is
our
argument
however
that
in
1967
when
this
chain
was
made
there
is
no
reflection
that
congress
adopted
the
gender
discrimination
because
it
was
abandoning
a
fundamental
needs
meeting
purpose
of
the
program
and
moreover
there
is
no
indication
that
when
adopted
this
change
it
was
related
to
the
issue
of
desertion.
once
again,
all
of
the
discussion
about
desertion
comes
essentially
in
two
sources.
one
is
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
that
i
referred
to,
the
concern
desertion.
child
support
program,
the
afdc
freeze
and
so
forth.
there,
responses
of
the
legislation
the
committee
chairman
and
so
forth
spoke
in
terms
of
desertion.
the
other
time
desertion
was
discussed.
well,
was
with
regard
to
afdc-u
program
and
was
by
those
upon
who
the
solicitor
general
relies
who
were
those,
who
were
oppose
or
rather
who
supported
expansion
of
the
program
and
will
ultimately
voted
against
this
bill
was
adopted.
those
individuals
said,
we
need
a
mandatory
afdc-u
program
and
every
state
to
fight
desertion.
and
that
was
voted
down
by
the
congress.
but
the
congress
supported
was
a
bill
presented
by
senator
long,
by
congressman
mills
which
--
to
which
they
attached
no
significance.
they
never
even
noted
on
the
house
of
senate
floor
in
presenting
the
bill
that
a
gender
discrimination
it's
been
introduced
here.
it
went
entirely
without
notice
as
senator
long
in
discussing
the
bill
with
other
senators
referred
interchangeably
to
the
unemployed
fathers
and
the
unemployed
parent
bill.
he
didn't
see
it
is
a
significant
apparently
and
no
one
else
called
him
on
it
said,
why
are
we
changing
this
from
unemployed
parent
to
unemployed
father?
the
reason
we
submit
is
that
they
were
thinking
consistently
in
terms
of
the
type
stereo
type
for
this
court
has
rejected.
rejected
in
standing,
the
assumption
that
men
are
going
to
go
out
into
the
world
of
work
and
women
will
stay
at
home.
the
(inaudible)
can
overbroad
generalizations
in
wiesenfeld
that
it
is
only
the
male
parent's
earnings
that
provides
significance
source
of
support.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
it
certainly
is
and
we
really
have
no
explanation
for
that.
it
did
happen,
it
was
not
the
law
before
the
afdc
and
afdc-u
benefits
were
divided
in
the
sex
neutral
basis
and
we
have
searched
through
the
legislative
history
as
of
our
opponents
and
the
best
explanations
have
been
offered
and
we
believe
the
best
explanation
is
that
they
even
didn't
think
about
it.
they
slip
into
some
format.
we
believe
because
they
were
indeed
looking
to
a
prior
touch
into
the
work
force
and
assumed
when
you
look
at
the
question
of
employment
that
women
did
not
contribute
significantly
to
their
families
in
the
past.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
were
struck
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
we
were
struck
by
the
fact
that
what
appears
to
be
a
major
argument
in
their
brief
that
there's
no
gender
discrimination
in
this
case
at
all.
i
was
not
trust
before
this
morning
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
distribution
of
these
benefits.
that's
right,
and
that
we
simply
believe
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
indeed
in
every
family
their
argument
is
that
in
every
family
where
unemployed
mother
is
denied
benefits
there
is
a
father
also
because
by
definition
we're
talking
about
two-parent
families.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
maybe
boys,
maybe
girls.
the
issues
in
this
case
however
is
that
the
benefits
that
are
being
provided
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that's
right,
your
honor
and
i
did
not
address
it
this
morning
because
they
seem
to
have
pretty
much
abandon
this
morning
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
fine
and
our
response
to
that
is
that
the
benefits
that
are
issue
in
this
case
are
benefits
based
upon
past
employment
when
government
distributes
benefits
on
the
basis
of
past
employment.
and
then
denies
them,
when
the
person
who
is
employed
in
the
pass
as
a
woman
it
is
clearly
denigrating
the
efforts
of
women
who
we're
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
no,
it
is
not
a
normal
compensation.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
it
is
based
upon
past
employment
and
need
your
honor
that
the
federal
government
has
by
statute
determined
that
certain
people
are
eligible
for
benefits
and
the
criteria
for
illegibility
are
essentially
for
its
purposes,
its
need
and
past
employment.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
it
is
need
and
past
employment
there's
a
specific
past
employment
test
6
out
of
13
quarters.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
is
correct.
it
is
so
based
upon
past
employment.
it
is
not
based
upon
past
contributions
to
a
fund.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
it
is
based
upon
past
employment.
and
it's
determined
that
past
employment
of
men
qualifies
the
family
for
benefits
and
the
past
employment
of
women
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
but
that
is
defined
in
terms
of
past
employment.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
there's
no
question
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
and
we
would
submit
to
that
is
no
different
from
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
this
court
has
found
in
many
previous
cases
in
goldfarb
and
wiesenfeld
for
example,
the
court
found
that
there
was
discrimination
against
one
particular
category
of
family,
that
and
which
the
female
spouse
is
the
wage
earner.
and
in
frontiero
and
in
jablon
the
(voice
overlap)
court
found
that
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
these
are
different
cases.
in
frontiero,
it
was
a
question
of
husband
wife
families
some
of
them
receive
larger
benefits.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
but
they
were
benefits
that
went
to
the
family
not
every
person,
not
every
serviceman
or
servicewoman
received
those
benefits.
it
was
only
if
there
is
a
dependent
it
was
to
a
husband-wife
family
that
those
benefits
were
being
provided
and
they
were
provided
to
all
families
in
which
the
husband
was
the
employee,
but
they
were
not
provided
to
all
families
in
which
the
woman
was
employee
and
they
were
family
benefits
that
issued
in
those
cases.
so,
we
submit
that
there
is
clearly
gender
discrimination
involved
in
this
case.
and
therefore
it's
unconstitutional.
in
sum
then
with
regards
to
the
case
on
merits,
it
is
our
argument
that
the
purpose
--
the
overriding
purpose
of
the
afdc-u
program
is
to
meet
the
need
of
children
caused
by
the
unemployment
of
parent
and
the
denial
on
the
basis
of
the
sex
of
that
unemployed
parent
neither
to
serves
nor
as
related
to
important
governmental
objectives.
the
purpose
for
the
gender
classifications
was
not
to
deter
desertion
but
rather
that
purpose
was
served
in
sex
neutral
terms.
and
finally,
the
classification
was
based
upon
sex
stereotypes
upon
archaic
and
overbroad
generalizations
about
the
roles
of
men
and
women
as
breadwinners
and
i
should
also
note,
we
have
not
discussed
but
the
roles
of
men
and
women
as
family
deserters
with
the
assumption
that
it
is
the
father
who
always
desert
the
family
despite
the
statistical
showing
that
there
are
more
fathers
and
mothers
who
desert.
but
still
clearly
desertion
is
something
that
might
confront
either
parent
and
this
court
has
never
accepted
sex
stereotyping
simply
on
the
basis
that
more
of
one
sex
than
another
sex
might
engage
in
certain
behavior
and
therefore
denied
benefits
to
all
members
of
the
sex
because
of
the
possible
behavior
of
a
certain
members
of
the
sex.
accordingly,
the
decision
on
merit
should
be
affirmed
and
i
will
turn
to
the
question
of
remedy
raised
in
this
case
solely
by
the
state
of
massachusetts.
i
will
first
discuss
for
a
moment
the
traditional
choice
of
remedy,
the
choice
that
has
always
confronted
this
court
in
the
past
between
invalidation
of
the
program
itself
or
extension
to
the
class
that
has
been
excluded.
in
this
case,
the
class
of
families
with
an
unemployed
mother
where
the
families
denied
benefits
solely
because
the
unemployed
parent
was
a
female
and
not
male.
we
raise
this
for
minute
because
the
state's
attack
on
extension
has
included
the
argument
that
extension
violates
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers.
we
will
then
turn
to
the
restructuring
primary
wage
earner
remedy
urged
by
the
state.
extension
of
benefits
to
the
excluded
class
follows
the
consistent
line
of
this
court's
equal
protection
benefit
cases
including
gender
discrimination
cases
and
it's
clearly
correct.
invalidation
would
cause
the
abrupt
termination
of
benefits
to
more
half
a
million
needy
children
and
their
parents
would
disrupt
the
state
and
local
treasuries
involved
whereas,
extension
would
continue
benefits
to
those
needy
families
and
also
provide
benefits
to
needy
family
in
which
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
where
a
federal
court
ordered
this
time
i
mean
all
of
the
social
security
act
cases
before
this
court
extension
has
been
the
remedy
and
of
course
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
example
in
the
residency
cases
the
duration
of
shapiro
against
thompson
and
so
forth
involved
state
afdc
and
other
public
assistance
programs
and
the
remedy
there
was
to
extend
to
those
who
had
less
than
a
year's
residence
in
the
state.
again,
in
all
of
these
programs
as
we
would
point
out
there's
an
option
to
the
state
to
participate
in
the
program
or
not.
indeed,
with
regard
to
the
afdc-u
program.
there's
an
option
to
the
state
to
participate
in
the
afdc-u
program
and
still
retain
its
participation
in
the
basic
afdc
program.
so,
the
order
of
extension
here
simply
makes
it
possible
for
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
every
other
state
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
wishes
to
participate
in
the
extended
program.
whereas,
in
validation
would
make
it
impossible
for
any
state
even
if
it
wants
too
to
participate
in
the
extended
program
and
this
court
as
the
earlier
received
an
amicus
brief
from
the
state
of
pennsylvania
which
indicated
affirmatively
that
it
wanted
and
extended
afdc
program
who
would
be
denied
that
opportunity
if
invalidation
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
no,
no
if
the
court's
order
were
to
invalidate
the
afdc-u
program
the
state
then
could
only
provide
benefits
to
families
of
the
unemployed
by
using
its
own
money
entirely
had
been
denied
the
opportunity
to
request
federal
reimbursement
in
effect.
and
that's
what
that
issue
here
in
terms
of
invalidation
or
extension.
and
that
is
clearly
why
invalidation
is
simply
not
adopted
in
benefit
cases
because
of
the
problems
it
would
present.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
the
argument
here
is
apparently
the
state
of
massachusetts
would
like
to
get
some
federal
matching
for
certain
families
but
not
for
others.
so,
it
is
taking
the
occasion
of
this
case
to
do
an
effect
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
was
suggesting
before
to
try
to
redefine
the
terms
in
the
act
not
really
as
a
matter
of
extension
or
invalidation.
extensions
to
the
excluded
class
clearly
extension
to
the
excluded
class
here
means
picking
up
the
families
would
be
eligible
but
for
the
sex
of
the
unemployed
parents.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
and
there's
no
really
much
complication,
you're
rather
with
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
said
is
why
were
added.
why
don't
we
redesign
these
programs
away
with
in
1979
but
really
like
to
see
it
and
that's
why
having
a
primary
wage
earner
test
with
the
state
in
effect
is
doing
is
arguing
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
that
indeed
perhaps
is
a
way
of
avoiding
the
constitutional
issue.
the
court
could
say
that
looking
at
the
legislative
history
congress
in
1967
said
file
there
but
really
meant
primary
wage
earner.
the
problem
is
that
will
clearly
fail
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
congress
said
father,
congress
meant
father,
congress
never
said
primary
wage
earner
whenever
been
used
the
term.
so,
instead
what
we
have
here
is
the
state
seeking
a
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
is
extending
the
benefits
to
the
classes
it's
been
excluded.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
is
what
the
state
is
saying
but
we
did
run
in
many
ways
runs
a
file
of
the
test
for
remedies
starting
with
the
separability
clause
that
is
in
the
social
security
act
itself
which
provides
that
the
invalidation
of
any
provision
of
the
act
and
we
are
discussing
remedy
of
course
only
if
the
provision
of
the
act
has
been
held
invalid
as
it
applies
to
certain
persons
shall
not
effect
its
application
to
others
and
yet
with
the
state
is
arguing
for
is
determination
of
benefits
to
many
families
currently
receiving
them
because
there
some
reason
the
father,
well
unemployed
and
while
his
unemployment
has
made
the
family
needy
the
father
does
not
satisfy
the
primary
wage
earner
test
for
some
reason.
so,
clearly
the
separability
clause
of
the
act
should
be
violated.
moreover,
the
administration
of
the
afdc-u
program
would
be
seriously
disrupted
throughout
the
country.
the
states
attempted
to
grapple
with
the
term
primary
wage
earner
as
i
suggest
before
the
legislative
history
does
not
give
any
guidance
as
to
what
primary
wage
earner
means.
what
congress
did
do
in
1961
and
1967
is
make
irrelevant
the
employment
of
the
spouse
and
we
believe
the
court
should
adhere
to
that.
and
finally,
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
and
injunctive
relief.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
it
really
was
the
end
of
it
your
honor,
that
the
court
entered
its
injunction
on
april
20th
and
at
least
i
think
the
united
states
and
plaintiff
thought
the
case
was
over.
the
state
then
came
back
and
in
the
process
of
implementing
the
court's
order
sought
to
impose
the
primary
wage
earner
test
then
the
parties
had
to
go
back
and
litigate
the
state's
changing
of
the
test.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
now,
the
court
did
not
rewrite
it,
the
court
decided
as
between
the
choice
it
could
either
invalidate
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
the
statute,
the
statute
of
the
afdc
program
was
continued
in
effect
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
to
the
extent
that
changed
the
word
“parent
to
father”,
yes
but
not
the
rest
of
the
act.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
it
had
been
repealed
by
the
--
or
it's
been
amended
by
the
change
of
father,
i
don't
believe
it's
been
repealed
the
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
--
word
have
been
changed.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
the
injunction
was
needed
both
as
against
the
state
to
have
it
so
long
as
it
had
in
afdc-u
program
to
provide
benefits
in
the
sex
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
no
the
state
could
off
out
of
the
program
in
any
time.
the
injunction
is
--
as
de
novo
for
cases
what
so
long
as
you
are
in
the
federal
program
you
must
comply
with
the
federal
law
that
it's
now
been
rendered
constitutional.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
by
the
court's
decision.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
why
i
think
the
result
would've
been
the
same
as
this
we're
arguing
before
in
this
case.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
differences
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
to
size
up
inner
out
which
still
the
decision
that
it
has.
the
one
thing
it
cannot
do
is
continue
to
discriminate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
would
have
been
invalidation
of
the
program.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
one
of
the
two
remedial
choices
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
it
would've
been
the
sex
discrimination
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
is
not
the
course
of
course
it
is
been
followed
in
any
of
the
prior
cases
in
weinberger
against
wiesenfeld
for
example,
the
court
had
the
option
of
denying
benefits
to
all
young
widows
who
were
carrying
for
children
in
the
home.
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
well,
this
court
did
not
if
congress
that
option
of
course
that
extended
benefits
and
in
goldfarb,
this
court
did
not
give
congress
the
option
to
extended
benefits
and
in
every
case
it
did
the
right
thing.
we
would
submit
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
under
the
circumstances
because
the
test
as
all
the
parties
agree
justice
harlan
has
announced
to
most
succinctly
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
welsh
case
is
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
a
concurring
opinion
under
just
cited
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
he
was
the
only
vote
the
way
in
the
case
but
various
courts
have
--
had
described
that
as
the
correlation
of
the
case
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
alright,
i
withdraw
that.
we
would
submit
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
that
is
correct.
but
the
principle
announced,
the
principle
announced
with
regard
and
the
principle
followed
in
every
case
--
mr.
henry
a.
freedman
the
principle
followed
has
been
that
the
question
that
the
confronting
of
court
in
determining
at
aspect
of
the
statute
unconstitutional
is
whether
the
entire
program
is
to
be
abolish
whether
it
is
more
consistent
with
congress'
purposes
in
terms
of
the
entire
program
to
abolish
the
entire
program
or
to
extend
benefits
to
the
class
that
have
been
excluded
from
the
program.
now,
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history
here
shows
consistently
that
congress's
overwhelming
concern
was
with
the
needy
children
of
unemployed
parents
that
benefits
are
quadrupled
in
the
program
since
1967
when
this
provision
was
last
adopted
and
that
therefore
the
congressional
purposes
is
served
by
extending
benefits
to
the
class
and
leaving
the
congress
over
time
the
choice
of
how
it
may
wish
to
change
the
program
in
any
way.
thank
you,
your
honor.
