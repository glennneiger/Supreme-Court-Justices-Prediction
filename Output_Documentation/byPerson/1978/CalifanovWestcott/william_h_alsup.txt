mr.
william
h.
alsup
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts.
the
district
court
held
unconstitutional,
section
407
of
the
social
security
act
that's
a
provision
which
extends
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children,
the
two-parent
families
whose
father
is
unemployed.
the
district
court
held
the
provision
unconstitutional
because
it
does
not
likewise
extends
such
aid
to
similarly
situated
families
whose
mothers
are
unemployed.
the
secretary
of
hew
appeals
the
holding
that
that
section
is
unconstitutional.
john
pratt,
commissioner
of
public
welfare
and
a
consolidated
appeal
appeals
only
from
the
remedies
selected
by
the
district
court.
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
provides
financial
assistance
to
families
with
needy
children.
it's
a
program
under
which
if
a
state
elects
to
participate
and
submits
a
plan
which
complies
the
section
402
of
the
social
security
act,
the
federal
government
will
participate
in
funding
of
the
program.
originally,
the
program
was
limited
to
needy
children
who
where
deprived
of
parental,
the
support
of
a
parent
by
virtue
of
the
absence
from
the
home
of
the
parent
or
a
parent
or
the
death
of
a
parent
or
the
incapacity
of
a
parent.
principally,
this
was
limited
to
single
parent
families.
later
in
adjunct
program,
that
is
the
program
that
we're
concerned
with
today
was
added.
that
program
extended
afdc
benefits,
the
two
parent
families
where
there
was
an
unemployed
father.
now,
that
program
appears
in
section
407
of
the
social
security
act,
that's
42
u.s.c.
706,
i'm
sorry
607.
in
order
for
a
two-parent
family
to
qualify
under
that
provision,
the
family
must
show
that
the
father
has
a
minimum
but
recent
connection
with
the
employment
market
and
that
he
is
unemployed.
the
act
does
not
require
that
the
mother
be
in
a
labor
market
nor
does
it
require
that
she
be
unemployed
or
that
she
be
employed.
in
fact,
she
may
be
employed
and
the
only
effect
of
her
earnings
is
to
reduce
the
amount
of
the
benefits
that
are
paid
to
the
family.
in
this
case,
the
appellees
are
two
families
which
did
not
qualify
because
the
father's
lack
the
requisite
employment
history.
the
act
as
mentioned
requires
that
there
be
some
recent
but
minimal
connections
with
the
labor
market.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
correct.
the
fathers
did
not
qualify
because
the
act
requires
that
within
one
year
prior
to
the
date
of
application,
the
father
have
been
employed
that
is
earned
at
least
$50.00
in
six
out
of
the
preceding
13
quarters
or
it
counts
in
addition
to
earning
of
$50.00
per
quarter
if
the
father
had
been
enrolled
in
a
training
program
that
would've
counted
toward
the
six
out
of
the
13
quarters.
as
mentioned,
neither
mr.
westcott
nor
mr.
westwood
satisfied
this
prerequisite.
and
as
justice
stewart
points
out
in
both
cases,
the
mothers
did
satisfy
that
requirement
and
they
we're
unemployed.
accordingly,
they
were
denied
benefit
under
the
program.
these
two
families
then
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court.
on
summary
judgment
the
court
held
the
program
was
unconstitutional
either
under
the
rational
basis
test
or
under
the
substantial
connection
test.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
component
of
that
due
process
clause.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
correct.
the
district
court
in
fact
sustained
that
claim.
the
district
court
reasoned
that
there
were
only
purposes
that
could
be
imagined
for
such
a
program,
one
was
to
assist
needy
children
of
families
which
were
impacted
adversely
by
unemployment.
secondly,
the
court
said,
the
unemployed
fathers
program
have
been
designed
to
remedy
a
structural
flow
in
the
basic
afdc
program
which
had
encouraged
unemployed
fathers
to
desert
in
order
that
their
remaining
family
could
qualify
for
benefits.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
think
that's
--
it
has
been
recently.
i'll
re-modify
that
to
say
that
families
adversely
effective
by
unemployment.
well,
the
district
court
reasoned
that
with
respect
to
the
first
of
those
two
objectives,
that
is
to
assist
families
adversely
affected
by
unemployment,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
the
woman
or
the
man
who
had
been
discharged
or
lost
employment
that
both
families
we're
just
as
needy.
i
should
say
by
the
way
that
the
government
does
not
disagree
with
that
part
of
the
analysis
of
the
district
court.
our
disagreement
concerns
the
second
goal
of
the
statute.
that
again
is
to
remedy
a
structural
flow
in
the
basic
afdc
program
that
had
created
an
incentive
for
an
unemployed
father
to
leave
home
so
that
the
mother
and
child
or
other
children
could
qualify.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
would
like
because
that
has
become
such
an
important
issue
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
spend
a
fair
part
of
my
argument
time
going
over
some
of
the
legislative
history
but
i
think
you're
absolutely
correct
that
was
a
predominant
goal
in
both
1961,
1962,
and
1967
when
this
program
took
final
shape.
with
respect
to
that
goal
though,
the
district
court
said
that
the
program
might
go
to
a
part
of
the
way
towards
eliminating
the
incentive
to
desert
but
there
was
still
an
incentive
to
desert
and
exactly
the
case
before
the
court
because
the
mother
had
lost
her
job
and
therefore
the
family
needed
income
and
the
father,
though
he
had
been
connected
with
the
labor
market
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
nonetheless
might
leave
home
in
order
to
qualify
the
family.
therefore,
the
court
said
the
statute
was
--
did
not
go
as
far
as
necessary
and
to
remedy
the
desertion
problem
and
in
fact
afforded
the
desertion
remedy
intended
by
congress
and
therefore
did
not
satisfy
the
substantial
connection
test
nor
the
rational
basis
test.
now,
our
appeal
here
is
a
narrow
one
as
i
mentioned
we
do
not
--
in
fact
we
agree
that
if
the
sole
purpose
of
the
unemployed
fathers
program
had
been
to
provide
relief
to
needy
families
hurt
by
unemployment
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
limit
the
benefits
based
upon
a
stereo
typical
assumption
that
working
mother's
incomes
are
less
important
that
working
father's
incomes.
we
disagree
however
with
the
district
court's
refusal
to
sustain
the
program
as
substantially
related
to
the
purpose
to
remove
or
mitigate
that
incentive
for
fathers
to
desert
that
was
existent
and
identified
under
the
prior
program.
let's
consider
that
latter
point
for
a
moment.
the
afdc
program
began
in
1935
as
president
roosevelt
said
at
the
time
he
proposed
it
to
court
the
program
was
to
provide
to
aid
to
children.
there
we're
two
basic
principles
involved.
first,
the
president
and
congress
reason
that
needy
children
with
two
able
body
parents
with
be
assisted
by
general
work
relief
programs
and
unemployment
compensation.
therefore,
there
was
no
especial
need
to
enact
the
program
for
them.
however,
second,
children
with
only
a
single
parent
would
not
be
assisted
by
such
general
work
relief
because
as
was
all
too
common
in
that
day
such
a
parent
would
be
an
able
to
accept
employment
without
placing
the
child
in
an
institution.
that
was
an
order
to
avoid
breaking
up
the
home
where
there
was
a
single
parent
that
congress
originally
enacted
the
afdc
programs
so
as
to
give
that
parent
a
choice
to
be
able
to
stay
home
and
take
care
of
the
child
in
the
event
there
was
only
a
single
parent
and
that
applied
whether
the
--
it
was
a
father
or
a
mother.
now,
over
the
years
it
became
generally
accepted
in
congress
so
found
that
1961,
1962,
and
1967
that
rather
than
“maintaining
and
strengthening
family
life”
as
section
401
proclaims
its
goal
to
be
the
afdc
program
in
fact
had
a
very
perverse
effect
of
breaking
up
homes.
president
kennedy
said
in
his
first
state
of
the
union
address,
“too
many
fathers
unable
to
support
their
families
had
resulted
to
real
or
pretended
desertion
in
order
to
qualify
there
children
for
help.”
so,
the
president
asked
congress
to
pass
what
was
then
called
an
unemployed
parent
program.
that
program
provided
aid
both
unemployed
fathers
and
unemployed
mothers
but
where
the
predominant
reasons
behind
that
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
aid
to
the
families.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
you're
absolutely
correct
your
honor
and
i
misspoke
and
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
this
is
aid
to
the
families
and
not
to
any
particular
individuals
within
that
family.
the
whole
program
is
designed
for
families
with
children.
now,
two
reasons
were
given
by
the
administration
and
throughout
the
legislative
history
for
enacting
the
program
in
1961.
first,
the
country
was
in
a
recession
and
extension
of
afdc
to
families
that
were
hurt
by
unemployment
was
a
form
of
temporary
unemployment
relief.
second
however,
congress
did
want
to
reduce
or
mitigate
the
incentive
for
fathers
to
desert
which
have
been
caused
since
1935
by
the
basic
afdc
program
itself.
now,
even
though
we're
concern
principally
with
1967
change,
this
legislative
history
in
1961
and
1962
is
very
pertinent
because
it
reflects
and
eliminates
congressional
intent
in
dealing
with
this
problem
over
the
years.
secretary
ribicoff
appeared
as
the
lead
of
witness
or
the
second
witness
behind
secretary
goldberg.
he
said,
“this
bill
would
eliminate
one
of
the
major
concerns
expressed
through
the
years
about
aid
to
dependent
children
namely
that
unemployed
fathers
are
forced
to
desert
their
families
in
order
that
their
families
may
receive
aid.”
he
presented
convincing
evidence
of
this.
he
showed
that
there
was
an
overwhelming
percentage
of
cases
in
which
there
was
no
father
in
the
home.
in
fact,
the
1958
statistic
show
this
and
only
1%
of
the
afdc
cases,
1%
was
there
just
a
father
in
the
home
with
the
children.
and
70%
of
the
cases
there
was
mother
in
the
home
with
the
children
but
no
father
and
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
in
19.5%
both
were
present
and
in
10%
both
had
deserted
or
neither
was
present.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
principally
correct
except
for
the
incapacity
point
if
a
parent
is
incapacitated
if
they
were
not
able
bodied
and
therefore
they
were
able
to
qualify.
as
a
practical
matter,
most
of
the
families
were
single
parent
families
but
an
exception
was
made
when
the
father
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no,
it's
19.5%.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
and
10%
was
in
neither.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
and
10%
of
those
were
neither
that
means
that
the
children
were
living
with
relatives
and
not
with
the
parents.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
not
to
a
foster
home.
usually,
the
grant
parents
or
uncles
or
aunts
foster
homes
came
in
later
in
a
later
amendment.
so,
again
there's
1%
a
father
only,
70%
mother
only,
19.5%
both
and
10%
neither.
now,
18%
of
all
those
cases
was
a
case
in
which
the
father
had
deserted.
and
by
desert,
i
don't
mean
that
they
had
died
or
divorced
there's
another
category
for
those.
this
18%
were
people
who
literally
deserted
their
family.
now,
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
a
problem
with
maternal
desertion.
the
statistics
that
were
presented
showed
that
the
number
of
cases
in
which
a
mother
had
deserted
from
a
two-parent-family
at
most
could
be
1.8%.
that
1.8%
also
included
departures
due
to
death
or
incapacity
or
divorced.
so,
although
we
can't
give
you
the
exact
breakdown
within
that
1.8%,
we
know
that
number
of
maternal
desertions
was
quite
small.
so,
we
only
have
a
problem
of
massive
fathers
deserting
in
order
at
least
in
some
cases
to
qualify
for
benefits
virtually,
no
mothers
doing
the
same.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct.
now,
representative
mccormick
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
correct
under
the
original
program.
i
don't
believe
that's
happened
in
this
case
but
you're
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
correct.
congress
did
not
remedy
this
precise
situation
and
the
1967
amendment.
now,
for
example
on
the
house
in
1961,
in
the
house
floor,
representative
mccormick
said
about
this
great
provision,
“it
is
my
considered
opinion
which
is
shared
by
many
social
welfare
leaders
that
these
restrictions
referring
to
the
previous
program
have
contributed
to
advance
instability
and
synthetic
desertions
when
such
desertions
represented
the
fathers
only
means
of
getting
adequate
financial
protection
for
his
minor
children.
that
has
been
cited
in
the
briefs
but
because
it's
in
a
footnote
let
me
call
the
court's
attention
to
that.
that's
107
congressional
record
3768.
now
we
cited
other
passages
similar
to
that
in
our
brief.
the
program
was
passed
it
was
optional
only
with
the
states
just
the
unemployed
parent
program
in
12
states
quickly
adopted
it.
but
the
program
ran
out
a
year
later.
secretary
ribicoff
came
back
to
congress
and
successfully
obtained
another
extension
of
the
same
program.
he
submitted
the
report
during
the
senate
hearings
on
the
bill
which
showed
that
in
fact
it
had
accomplished
the
purpose
in
part
of
preventing
family
breakups.
he
said
that
one
of
the
most
significant
services
which
the
adc-up
referring
to
unemployed
parents
program
offered
the
recipient
families
was
“the
prevention
of
family
breakups.”
assistant
secretary
wilbur
cohen
also
testified
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
recommendation
was
made
was
to
provide
assistance
where
there
was
unemployment.
so
as
not
to
encourage
men
to
leave
their
homes
in
order
to
make
their
families
eligible,
it
appears
page
154
of
the
senate
hearings.
and
then
representative
keil
(ph)
said
concerning
the
extension.
“it
seemed
to
me
last
year
or
it
seemed
to
us
last
year
before
the
provision
was
first
added
that
congress
was
saying
this
to
the
unemployed
father.
if
you
stay
with
your
family
and
try
to
hold
it
together
during
this
critical
period,
we
can
offer
you
no
federal
assistance
but
if
you
happen
to
desert
them,
your
family
will
be
fully
eligible
for
aid
to
dependent
children.”
he
continued,
this
seems
then
and
it
seems
to
us
now
an
anomalous
and
indefensible
situation.
moreover,
there
is
evidence
which
indicates
that
this
new
program
has
already
had
the
effect
of
returning
fathers
to
their
families.
a
study
he
said
conducted
by
hew
for
the
first
seven
months
of
the
program's
operations
shows
that
of
the
66,100
applications
allowed
at
that
time
2,900
families
which
have
been
receiving
aid
to
dependent
children
for
reasons
other
than
unemployment
became
eligible
under
the
new
program
usually
because
an
absent
father
had
returned
to
the
home.
now,
in
1967
congress
restricted
the
program
to
unemployed
fathers
only.
the
recession
had
passed
at
that
time
and
the
principle
objective
in
1967
in
restricting
it
only
to
unemployed
fathers
was
that
congress
had
intended
to
remedy
the
structural
incentive
built-in
to
the
original
program
for
fathers
to
desert.
i
will
only
burden
you
with
one
quotation
from
the
senate
report
in
1967.
they
said,
“many
is
concerned
about
the
effect
that
absence
of
a
state
program
has
on
family
stability
where
there
is
no
such
program
and
let
me
pause
here.
there
were
only
22
states
at
that
time
which
had
adopted
this
program.
congress
was
concerned
that
the

had
not
yet
adopted
it
where
there
is
no
such
program
there
is
an
incentive
for
an
unemployed
father
to
desert
his
family
in
order
to
make
them
eligible
for
assistance.
this
will
be
a
matter
of
continuing
study
by
the
committee.
this
program
was
originally
conceived
by
congress
as
one
to
provide
aid
for
the
children
of
unemployed
fathers.
however,
some
states
make
families
in
which
the
father
is
working
but
the
mother
unemployed
eligible
for
assistance
the
bill
will
not
allow
such
situations.”
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
correct
in
this
sense.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
fathers
do
not
even
meet
the
connection
with
the
employment
market
test
of
the
six
out
of
the
13
quarters.
the
relief
afforded
by
the
district
court
would
also
provide
relief
in
the
case
where
the
father
actually
is
employed.
but
the
mother
becomes
unemployed
and
therefore
because
they
below
the
standard
of
need
are
eligible
for
assistance.
so,
you
are
correct.
the
relief,
i
believe
does
extend
beyond
the
facts
of
this
individual
case.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
yes.
i've
looked
at
that
provision
of
the
task
force
report
it's
about
a
page
and
a
half
and
the
context
of
a
much
longer
report
concerning
discrimination
against
women
in
federal
legislation.
that
report
does
not
purport
to
have
to
any
exhaustive
analysis
of
the
legislative
history.
in
fact,
there
is
no
analysis
on
the
legislative
history
and
on
its
face
this
does
appear
to
be
some
sort
of
curious
sex
discrimination
but
once
you
get
into
the
legislative
history
and
you
see
that
there
was
a
very
permissible
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
and
that
this
is
substantial
related
to
curing
that
problem.
then,
you
see
that
it
is
not
a
suspect
or
unconstitutional
classification
and
the
task
force
report
didn't
address
itself
to
that
legislative
history.
so,
we
disagree
with
the
analysis
of
that
report
and
i
believe
had
they
considered
the
legislative
history
that
we
know
like
that
they
might
agree
with
us.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
of
course
the
solicitor
general
speaks
for
the
united
states
and
the
department
of
justice
before
this
court
with
respect
to
one
of
our
legal
positions
are.
so,
to
that
extent,
the
solicitor
general
has
disapproved
the
report
of
the
task
force.
