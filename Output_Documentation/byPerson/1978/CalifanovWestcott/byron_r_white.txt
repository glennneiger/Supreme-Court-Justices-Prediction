it
discriminated

mr.
alsup,
your
opponent's
brief
says
that
the
tax
for
zone
sex
discrimination
of
the
civil
rights
division
last
october
made
in
this
report
to
the
president
made
a
flat
statement
that
the
statute
overtly
and
sub-sensitively
discriminated
against
women,
do
you
have
any
comment
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
department
of
justice
assume
any
responsibility
for
what
the
task
force?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
then
that
the
challenge
provision
is
unconstitutional?
or
do
you
agree
with
the
united
states
in
that
respect?
justice
byron

that
isn't
quite
what
i've
asked
you.

and
save
this
amount?
justice
byron

but
in
fact
it
was?
justice
byron

white
so,
i
mean
--
justice
byron

but
congress
did
cut
back
in
the
program

whatever
that
be

you
wouldn't
be
here?

supposed
in

was
it
this

1961,
suppose
the
1967
has
been
adopted
the
1961
and
the
1967
form
and
were
perfectly
clear
from
legislative
history
which
you
dispute
that
the
reason
they
want
to
adopt
it
was
to
aviate
the
desertion
of
fathers.
would
you
still
argue
that
there
was
unconstitutional
gender
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
another
case
where
the
federal
court
ordered
the
state
to
remedy
an
equal
protection
violation
one
way
or
another?

well,
give

justice
byron

if
you
say
the
judge
may
add
father
and
mother
the
congress
clearly
meant
father
but
you
said
the
judge
you
can
order
those
words
that
one
word
to
mean
mother
and
father?
justice
byron

no.
all
the
state
suggests
is
that
we
said

is

why
didn't
the
court
just
say
i
enjoin
enforcement
of
this
statute,
i
just
found
them
constitutionally.
justice
byron

why
didn't
you
say
that?
it
went
much
far
than
that.
it
said,
i'm
not
going

invalidate
the

i'm
going
to
rewrite
it.
justice

yes,
but
the

well,
why
--
that
still
doesn't
explain
why
they
needed
and
injunction
to
require
the
inclusion
of
women?
justice

why?
