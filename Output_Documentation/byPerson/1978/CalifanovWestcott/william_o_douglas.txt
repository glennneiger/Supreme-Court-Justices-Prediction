justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
alsup,
can
i
ask
one
question
about
the
facts
to
this
case?
if
the
fathers
in
this
case
both
families
should
desert,
would
the
families
then
become
eligible?
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
but
to
the
extent
you're
emphasizing
the
desire
to
prevent
a
paternal
desertion
from
qualifying
a
family
the
statute
really
doesn't
accomplish
anything
in
this
particular
case
and
does
it,
because
the
incentive
is
still
aware?
