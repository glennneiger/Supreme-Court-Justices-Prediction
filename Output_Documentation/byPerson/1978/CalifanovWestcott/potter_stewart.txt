justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
other
29%?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
program
up
until
then
was
applicable
only
to
families
and
which
there
was
one
parent
and
only
one
parent.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
some
29%
of
the
total,
we're
not
one
parent
family.
justice
potter
stewart
70%
were
no
father,
1%
were
no
mother?
justice
potter
stewart
and
29%?
justice
potter
stewart
with
or
such
family
with
kinfolk?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
apply
in
foster
homes?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
original
concept
the
families
would
then
become
eligible,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
johnson,
didn't
they
district
court's
remedy
do
no
more
than
provide
that
the
existing
statutory
framework
shall
be
applicable
when
--
to
unemployed,
to
situations
where
the
mother
is
not
employed
as
it
has
been
in
passed
to
situation
for
the
father's
unemployment.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
even
today
under
the
existing
statute
quite
apart
from
--
i
mean
assuming
it's
all
valid.
when
the
father
is
unemployed
even
though
the
mother
is
the
primary
wage
earner
in
the
family,
when
the
father
is
unemployed,
benefits
are
payable
if
the
family
income
is
below
the
standard
of
need,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
district
court
did
no
more
than
i
suggest,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
having
found
it
invalid
and
so
far
is
that
didn't
--
discriminated
against
the
women.
it
said
the
same
statutory
test
and
framework
shall
be
applicable
now
when
the
mother
is
unemployed
as
it
has
been
up
to
now
when
the
father
is
unemployed,
isn't
it
what
it
did?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
says
of
course
that
that's
perfectly
valid
legislation
and
that
is
my
brother
white
suggests
would
be
the
end
of
your
case
if
we
agree
with
the
government
of
united
states
that
this
is
not
unconstitutional,
then
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
congress
also
in
1967
enacted
the
law
that
said
these
afdc
payments
shall
be
made
only
when
the
father
is
unemployed
but
that
was
held
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
state
true
the
congressional
intent
we'd
reverse
the
district
court's
judgment
holding
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
an
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
fact
under
the
assuming
the
validity
of
the
present
program
if
the
principal
wage
earner
was
in
fact
the
mother,
nonetheless
afdc
payments
are
payable
if
the
father
is
unemployed,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
true
in
the
statue
not
the
practice
being
tolerated,
isn't
it
with
the
statute
provides?
justice
potter
stewart
unemployment.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
was
orr
against
orr
was
not
a
case
involving
a
government
largesse?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
then
in
any
events
it
was,
what
that
did
was
limited
discretion
of
a
divorce
court
judge
no
matter
what
the
situation
was
he
was
simply
not
prohibitive
from
ever
awarding
alimony
in
favor
of
a
husband
against
(voice
overlap)
wife
but
that
involved
private
property
of
two
other
people,
this
involves
government
largesse
and
there
are
opinions
in
that
area
or
somewhat
--
it
was
somewhat
different
cast,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
true
that
up
until
1961
if
two
parents
were
in
the
home
even
though
the
father
became
unemployed
they
were
totally
ineligible
for
afdc
payments?
justice
potter
stewart
until
1961
unemployment
didn't
have
any
thing
to
do
with
it
if
both
parents
were
there
and
therefore
if
an
unemployed
father
became
unemployed
prior
to
1961
there
would
be
an
incentive
for
him
to
leave
home
and
so
it
will
be
a
single
parent
family
so
they'll
be
eligible?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
up
until
1961
the
family
was
eligible
only
if
there
was
a
single
parent
it
was
not
eligible
if
they
were
--
if
both
parents
were
in
the
home
even
though
unemployed.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
after
and
that
was
the
problem
to
which
congress
is
addressing
itself
because
that
prior
to
1961
regime
provided
an
incentive
to
unemployed
father
who
became
unemployed
to
leave
home
so
his
family
would
be
eligible,
isn't
that
right?
am
i
might
quite
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
away,
physically
gone.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
said
that
you
understood
the
solicitor
general's
argument
to
be
entirely
based
upon
this
legislative
purpose
with
which
you
disagree.
and
it's
true
that
he
spent
great
deal
a
time
this
morning
in
oral
argument
on
that
subject.
but
as
i
read
the
brief,
the
basic
argument
is
that
this
is
simply
not
the
kind
of
gender
discrimination
with
which
this
court
has
previously
dealt
because
this
deals
with
benefits
to
families
and
the
families
might
be
all
female
or
might
be
all
girl,
children
and
that
the
benefits
that
are
payable
or
not
payable
are
not
in
anyway
discriminatory
upon
the
basis
of
gender
unlike
our
other
cases
to
which
you
just
been
citing
us?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
their
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
no
gender
discrimination
with
respect
to
the
benefits
are
not
payable?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
beneficiary
is
maybe
at
least
half
have
more
female
and
maybe
in
of
any
particular
case
100%
of
them
are.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
are
children,
there
may
be
boys
or
girls.
justice
potter
stewart
but
didn't
you
understand
that
to
be
a
large
part
of
their
argument
in
their
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
they
filed
their
brief
here
and
i
don't
think
they
withdrawn
any
part
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
not
employment
compensation?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
based
upon
past
employment?
justice
potter
stewart
his
need
unlike
social
security
payments
and
unlike
unemployment
compensation.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
test
as
to
where
--
when
a
person
is
unemployed.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
unemployment
but
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
its
present
unemployment?
that's
the
test?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
there's
a
compensation,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
military
compensation?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
freedman,
what
is
the
--
please
refresh
my
recollection
as
to
what
is
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case,
it
was
a
class
action?
what?
for
declaratory
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
a
declaratory
judgment
that
this
statutory
scheme
was
constitutionally
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
--
the
court
so
found
wouldn't
that
--
shouldn't
that
as
a
matter
of
appropriate
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
be
the
end
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
after
it's
been
held
invalid.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
that
reinstated
the
earlier?
justice
potter
stewart
1961-1962,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
although
that
have
been
repealed,
haven't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
effect
it
had.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
congress
wouldn't
to
decide
it,
wouldn't
it
if
the
court
had
held
this
statute,
this
1967
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
i
enjoined
its
enforcement
for
that
reason
period.
then
there
would
have
been
no
unemployment,
there
would've
been
no
afdc-u?
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
because
it
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
then
about
(voice
overlap)
whether
they
have
anything
at
all,
any
afdc-u
or
to
put
in
a
sex
neutral
one
or
none
at
all
but
until
the
congress
acted
this
1967
statute
would've
been
held
unconstitutional
and
the
district
court
would've
enjoined
its
enforcement
for
that
reason.
justice
potter
stewart
but
really
that's
an
option
of
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
one
distinctive
thing
about
that
opinion
is
that
none
of
the
other
aid
agreed
with
it.
