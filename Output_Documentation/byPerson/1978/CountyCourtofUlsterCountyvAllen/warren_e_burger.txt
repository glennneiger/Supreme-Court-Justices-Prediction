we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
county
court
of
ulster
against
allen.
chief
justice

e.

ms.
shapiro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
conceded
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
arguments,
you
are
telling
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
their
final
arguments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
page
you
are
referring
to
on
the
appendix
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
is
surely
on
22
(a),
it
is
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
lines,
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
lines,
sounds
as
though
he
is
waiving
any
question
about
the
validity
of
the
statute,
where
he
says,
if
you
think
that
hardrick
and
allen
exercised
dominion
control
over
the
weapons
in
the
purse,
then
follow
of
the
law
as
the
judge
gives
it
to
you
on
the
presumption
of
what
was
in
the
purse
is
as
to
all
four
or
three
or
two
or
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
was
his
failure
to
make
objection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
perhaps
explain
why
he
did
not
object
to
the
instructions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
anticipating
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
entirely
correct
that
the
lawyer
in
his
summation
cannot
argue
is
what
the
judge
is
later
going
to
say
in
the
charge,
cannot
properly
do
so
without
being
guilty
of
some
misconduct.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
appear
here
that
he
was
reading
the
statute
just
as
the
prosecution
was
reading
it,
when
you
couple
that
with
the
fact
that
he
made
no
objection
to
the
charge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
should
we
entertain
it
here,
that
is
the
next
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
he
not
virtually
give
the
instruction
that
is
given
on
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
that
you
may
infer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
page
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
knew
i
had
seen
it
somewhere,
but
essentially
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
instructs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
up
to
the
third
line
of
that
paragraph
of
the
instruction,
you
may
infer
and
draw
a
conclusion
that
such
prohibited
weapon
was
possessed
by
each
that
is
essentially
what
is
given
and
has
been
approved
universally
in
terms
of
possession
of
recently
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
stolen
property,
even
where
records
have
set
a
presumption
of
that
effect
would
violate
due
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
a
permissible
inference
is
acceptable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
young,
before
you
go
on,
let
me
try
to
clear
up
one
question.
if
no
appeal
had
been
taken
at
all,
direct
appeal
would
the
state
courts
in
new
york
entertain
habeas
corpus
to
attack
the
basis
of
the
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
us
get
an
answer
to
my
question
first.
if
there
was
no
direct
appeal
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
conviction
be
attacked
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
if
that
is
so,
would
it
not
follow
that
a
direct
appeal,
which
omitted
raising
certain
points,
would
not
be
permitted
on
habeas
corpus,
[voice
overlap]
habeas
corpus?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
we
come
down
now
to
what
you
were
about
to
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
12
to
17,
that
is
five
pages.
would
you
pinpoint
the
first
place
where
it
is
raised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
50a?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
coming
back
to
several
questions
put
to
you,
where
did
the
court
of
appeals
deal
with
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
really
suggests
that
the
dissenters
talk
something
about
it.
it
does
not
suggest
that
the
court
thought
it
was
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
we
can
look
at
the
whole
record
and
see
what
that
means
because
it
is
ambiguous
and
it
can't
mean
literally
what
it
says
because
on
this
record,
it
is
clear
that
these
two,
one
an
automatic
and
one
a
pistol
45
and
a
38
and
were
in
plain
sight
sticking
out
of
the
handbag.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
mean
they
were
not
in
plain
sight
to
the
driver.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
concede
the
officer
could
see
it
but
you
are
saying
that
the
jury
could
not
reasonably
infer
that
anyone
in
that
car
could
see
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
just
taking
one
segment
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
other
evidence
besides
what
this
colloquy
the
judge
indicated.
the
evidence
is
that
they
were
in
plain
sight
in
the
handbag
in
the
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
point
i
am
making
is
that
is
evidence
from
which
a
reasonable
juror
could
reasonably
conclude
that
other
passengers
in
the
car
saw
the
same
thing
the
officer
did.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
the
gun
which
was
in
plain
sight.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
crime
greater
for
the
possession
of
two
guns
than
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
