justice
potter
stewart
is
it
clear
that
it
was
jane
doe's
handbag?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
jane
doe
was
tried
in
a
juvenile
proceeding
of
some
kind?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
co-defendant
in
this
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
were
four
co-defendants
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
21.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
guns
were
concededly
found
in
the
car?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
car
was
on
a
trip
from
detroit
to
new
york
city,
that
is,
he
conceded
no
more
than
that,
did
he?
then
they
acknowledged
facts?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you
look
on
22,
he
made
that
point,
but
i
notice
had
denied
it?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
direct
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
alright
but
in
answer
to
just
my
brothers
white
and
brennan
you
pointed
out,
you
do
not
raise
the
exhaustion
point
here
because
of
the
well-settled
rule
that
exhaustion
is
satisfied
if
there
can
be
a
showing
that
a
further
pursuit
of
the
question
of
the
state
courts
would
be
futile.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
still
does
not
answer
the
question
of
the
direct
appeal
and
your
claim
that
it
was
not
even
presented
in
the
direct
appeal
and
that
therefore
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
not
asked
to
rule
on
the
constitutional
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
none
of
that
has
to
do
with
specifically
or
explicitly
with
the
presumption
at
issue,
in
the
statutory
presumption
at
issue
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
the
instructions
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
where?
24,
25?
justice
potter
stewart
well.
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
i
got
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
before
the
court
in
people
against
terra,
like
in
[inaudible]
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
you
are
on?
