justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
in
theory
ms.
shapiro,
i
do
not
know
what
the
procedural
practice
is
in
new
york,
but
if
a
trial
judge
tells
you
after
you
have
objected
that
i
am
going
to
charge
on
the
presumption,
you
do
not
go
to
the
jury
and
tell
them
that
this
presumption
is
all
bad
and
the
judge
may
tell
you,
it
is
alright,
but
i
do
not
believe
that.
you
follow
the
law
as
the
judge
gives
it
to
the
jury
in
your
argument
of
the
jury;
you
are
bound
pretty
much
by
the
judges’
variation
of
the
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
in
the
habeas
case,
second
circuit
opinion
does
cite
passages
from
briefs
but
as
i
read
judge
jason’s
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
that
does
not
pass
on
any
constitutional
question,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
concede
that
in
that
five
pages
you
did
not
specifically
challenge
it
on
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
your
motion
for
a
new
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
is
--
anyway
after
the
trial
is
over,
was
the
first
time
that
you
raised
the
point
constitutional
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
not
judge
jason’s
opinion
for
the
majority
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
make
any
reference,
at
least
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
to
a
federal
constitutional
challenge
having
been
made
to
the
presumption
that
leary
based?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
they
do
not
speak
for
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
to
me
doesn't
even
talk
about
a
federal
constitutional
doctrine
relating
to
presumption
in
the
majority
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
look
at
the
opinion,
we
can
look
at
it,
and
you
tell
where
it
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
first
paragraph
of
judge
jason’s
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
said
the
second
circuit
said
the
judge
jason’s
opinion
does
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
where
do
you
think
judge
jason’s
opinion
implicitly
decided
the
constitutional
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
starts
at
page
40a.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there
is
no
reference
in
that
opinion
to
any
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
then
you
must
be
able
to
convince
us
that
your
motion
raising
the
constitutional
question
in
a
motion
for
us
to
set
aside
the
verdict
and
the
trial
court
was
timely,
that
it
should
not
have
been
made
before
that
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
is
an
established
rule
of
new
york
practice
that
you
must
make
a
motion
based
on
a
constitutional
claim
at
the
time
that
judge
charges
the
jury.
you
do
not,
you
make
it
at
the
time
you
made
it,
in
this
case,
the
same
procedural
history
up
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
you
argued
the
question
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeal,
the
majority
opinion
simply
does
not
mention
that
one.
do
you
think
you
can
go
into
federal
habeas
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
prosecutor
saying
correct
with
respect
to
the
contention,
the
court’s
paraphrase
of
the
defense
contention
or
correct
to
the
court's
statement
that
that
is
the
prosecution’s
position?
