justice
john
paul
stevens
i
may
be
dumb
today,
but
i
do
not
understand
why
that
is
a
concession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
explain
a
little
more
to
me,
why
is
that
a
concession,
i
do
not
know,
there
is
a
concession
that
they
were
in
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
meant
the
part
what
you
read,
you
say
it
is
on
page
17
of
the
appendix?
justice
john
paul
stevens
21.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
am
sorry.
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
the
presumption
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
young,
is
it
perfectly
clear,
you
are
raising
a
federal
constitutional
challenge
and
not
a
state
one
because
although
you
do
cite
leary
against
united
states,
you
suggest
the
new
york
test
maybe
different,
and
then
you
cite
only
new
york
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
new
york
test
has
been
held
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
been
held
they
confirm
to
that's
set
out
in
leary,
and
then
you
go
ahead
and
just
cite
all
the
new
york
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
young,
i
imagine
one
reason
maybe
you
did
not
make
a
separate
point
of
the
constitutional
issue
in
any
of
these.
you
just
argued
it
in
passing
during
the
part
of
your
argument
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
if
somebody
read
your,
who
just
read
the
summary
of
argument
in
the
[inaudible]
you
never
find
the
mention
of
the
constitutionality.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
but
your
point,
it
is
under
the
point
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
the
conviction,
that
is
what
you
used?
justice
john
paul
stevens
40.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
will
surely
admit
that
you
did
not
argue
that
the
statute
was
facially
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
did
duck
it,
they
did
not
respond
to
your
precise
argument,
which
was
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
these
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
do
not
mention
that
argument.
and
the
fact
they
have
held
it
constitutional
as
applied
to
a
lot
of
other
facts,
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
validity
of
your
argument
as
applied
to
these
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
young,
the
colloquy
you
referred
to
of
course
was
in
connection
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
correct
that
defendant
though
testified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
dissenting
opinion
is
what
puzzles
me
and
as
mr.
justice
powell
pointed
out
early,
it
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
doe
was
the
only
woman
in
the
vehicle
expressly
admitted
that
it
was
her
possession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
so
there
was
other
evidence
then
beside
there
was
evidence
about
[voice
overlap]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
but
there
was
some
moral
testimony
about
what
happened
at
the
time
that
the
vehicle
was
stopped?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
was
something
more
in
the
record
other
than
the
fact
that
the
guns
were
in
the
car.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
just
told
me
a
moment
ago
that
police
officer
testified
that
she
made
some
remarks
concerning
the
location
of
the
gun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
the
evidence
they
relied
on
that
[voice
overlap]
dismiss
the
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
presumption
does
not
mean
everybody
automatically
possessed
that.
the
presumption
as
i
understand
it
means
that
the
jury
may
look
at
that
presumption
with
the
rest
of
the
evidence
and
may
draw
the
inference
that
everyone
possessed
it,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
not
have
to
accept
the
presumption?
