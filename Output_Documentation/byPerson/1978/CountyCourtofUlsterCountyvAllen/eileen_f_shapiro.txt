ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes
sir.
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding
presents
two
issues.
the
first
issue
is
waiver
and
the
second
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
state
evidentiary
presumption,
which
provides
with
certain
exceptions,
that
presence
in
an
automobile
of
any
of
the
weapons
enumerated
in
the
statute
is
presumptive
evidence
of
its
possession
by
all
persons
occupying
the
automobile
at
the
time
that
the
weapon
is
found.
the
threshold
question
here
is
whether
respondents
have
preserved
the
question
of
the
statute’s
constitutionality
or
habeas
corpus
review,
considering
that
respondents
failed
to
object
at
trail
to
a
jury
instruction,
which
only
partially
explained
the
statute
and
again
failed
to
object
either
at
trail
or
on
their
state
appeals
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself.
a
consideration
of
both
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
applicable
law
compelled
to
finding
that
respondents
have
indeed
failed
to
preserve
any
substitutive
constitutional
claim
for
collateral
review.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
the
respondents
and
a
16
year-old
girl,
who
was
later
adjudicated
as
a
youthful
offender,
and
was
therein
after
referred
to
as
jane
doe,
were
riding
in
a
car
on
the
new
york
state
thruway
in
upstate
ulster
county,
when
they
were
stopped
for
speeding
through
work
zone.
the
driver,
respondent
lemmons,
produced
a
license
and
a
registration.
a
radio
check
was
made
and
it
was
determined
that
he
was
wanted
on
a
michigan
fugitive
warrant.
he
was
arrested.
one
of
the
policemen,
one
trooper
askew
returned
to
the
vehicle,
looked
in
through
the
right
front
passenger
window
and
detected
protruding
from
a
ladies
handbag,
jane
doe’s
handbag,
on
the
floor
of
the
front
seat
of
the
car,
a
.45
automatic
pistol.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes
your
honor,
it
is
clear,
there
is
no
dispute.
he
reached
in,
removed
that
gun,
which
turned
out
to
be
fully
loaded,
i
believe
with
modified
hollow
point
bullets
and
found
underneath
that
gun
a
second
gun,
a
.38
smith
&
wesson
revolver,
also
fully
loaded.
the
officer
placed
all
three
of
the
remaining
occupants
of
the
car
under
arrest
and
then
attempted
to
enter
the
trunk
of
the
car.
the
trunk
key
was
not
recovered
on
any
of
the
respondents,
it
was
not
in
the
car
and
so
when
the
car
was
returned
to
the
barracks,
the
trunk
was
pried
open
and
the
police
found
therein
a
pound-and-a-half
of
heroin
and
a
.45
caliber
spitfire
machine
gun,
also
loaded
with
27
rounds
of
ammunition.
all
four
of
the
passengers
were
indicted
on
three
counts
of
felonious
weapons
possession
and
one
count
of
narcotics
possession,
a
charge
which
in
new
york
at
that
time
bore
a
potential
life
sentence.
they
--
as
the
record
clearly
shows,
all
the
parties,
the
respondents
and
jane
doe
noted
a
cooperative
defense
although
they
were
individually
represented
by
counsel.
in
particular,
respondents
directed
their
aspect
of
the
defense
toward
rebutting
the
articles
in
the
trunk
of
the
car,
the
heroin
count
and
the
machine
gun
count
and
doe’s
counsel
mr.
goldberg,
who
parenthetically
is
representing
respondents
in
this
proceeding,
directed
his
attention
toward
the
handguns
in
the
car.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
no,
she
was
tried
jointly.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
as
a
co-defendant
and
it
was
not
until
sentencing
that
the
trial
judge
set
aside
her
conviction,
adjudicated
her
a
youthful
offender.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
absolutely,
yes.
at
the
course
of
the
people’s
case,
the
respondents
and
jane
doe
made
a
routine
pro
forma
motion
to
dismiss,
which
in
new
york
is
rarely
granted
as
jeopardy
may
often
attach,
should
the
motion
be
erroneously
granted
and
then
on
appeal
it
cannot
be
reversed.
the
respondents’
motion
in
particular
was
directed
toward
the
fact
that
as
the
handguns
were
in
jane
doe’s
handbag,
they
were
on
her
person
under
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
presumption
at
issue
and
thus
they
could
not
be
held
responsible.
the
trial
court
agreeing
with
the
district’s
attorney
found
that
the
location
of
the
guns,
since
they
were
not
actually
in
jane
doe’s
pocket
or
whatever,
was
presented
in
fact
of
the
jury
and
thus
he
denied
their
motion.
in
fact,
respondents
hardrick
and
allen
even
appear
to
concede
in
that
motion,
which
is
reproduced
on
page
17
of
the
appendix,
then
in
fact,
the
judge
may
have
been
right
that
it
is
a
question
of
fact.
at
the
close
of
the
entire
case
all
counsels
adjoined
in
moving
to
dismiss
the
machine
gun
and
heroin
charges
against
jane
doe.
in
other
words,
jane
doe’s
lawyer
made
the
motion
and
counsel
for
the
three
respondents
piped
up
and
said,
yes
your
honor,
we
think
you
ought
to
grant
jane
doe’s
motion.
at
summation,
doe’s
lawyer
placed
great
emphasis
on
the
large
caliber
of
the
handguns,
the
weight
of
the
guns,
which
amount
to
approximately
6
pounds,
the
size
of
the
guns
and
in
particular
the
position
of
the
guns
in
the
handbag,
they
were
positioned
crosswise
so
as
to
keep
the
handbag
open.
to
support
his
position
that
the
respondents
tossed
the
guns
in
the
bag
at
the
time
that
the
car
--
either
at
the
time
the
car
was
flagged
down
by
the
police
or
in
the
interval
when
the
driver
was
being
arrested.
respondents
allen
and
hardrick
on
the
other
hand
placed
great
emphasis
on
the
absent
trunk
key
and
the
fact
that
the
car
had
been
borrowed
that
very
morning
from
respondent
lemmon’s
brother
in
rochester,
new
york,
approximately
250
miles
away
from
the
site
of
the
arrest.
and
then
in
unmistakable
language
in
their
submission,
these
respondents
allen
and
hardrick
virtually
conceded
their
guilt
on
the
handgun
charges.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
they
are
guilt
on
the
handgun
charges.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
pardon
me.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
in
their
submission
and
i
have
the
quote
from
the
submission,
which
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
page
21
to
22,
which
also
appears
on
page
654
of
the
transcript.
this
is
what
mr.
toraka,
counsel
for
allen
and
hardrick
said
to
the
jury.
if
you
are
living
under
their
times
and
conditions
and
you
travel
from
a
big
city,
detroit,
to
a
bigger
city,
new
york
city,
it
is
not
unusual
for
people
to
carry
guns,
small-arms
to
protect
themselves,
is
it?
there
are
places
in
new
york
city
policemen
fear
to
go,
which
you
have
got
to
understand
you
are
sitting
here
as
jurors,
these
are
people
live
flesh
and
blood
the
same
as
you,
different
motives,
different
objectives.
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
small
arms
were
in
the
pocket-book,
it
is
true,
the
question
is
who
do
they
belong
to?
if
you
think
that
hardrick
and
allen
had
exercised
dominion
control
over
the
weapons
in
the
purse
and
follow
the
law
as
the
judge
gives
it
to
you
on
the
presumption
of
what
was
in
the
purse
as
to
all
4
or
3
or
2
or
1
and
i
think
that
this
cannot
be
mistaken
as
anything
other
than
a
concession
on
those
charges.
after
summations
the
judge
charged
the
juror
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
pardon
me?
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
no,
it
is
concession
that
they,
allen
and
hardrick
brought
the
guns
from
detroit
where
they
were
coming
from
to
take
to
new
york
city.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
no,
i
am
sorry.
21
and
22
of
the
appendix.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
i
believe
he
conceded
more
than
that.
he
said,
look
at
these
two
fellows,
they
are
going
to
new
york
city
where
they
are
afraid
of
crime
and
they
are
bringing
these
guns
with
them,
what
is
wrong
with
that?
but
he
did
not
say,
why
are
you
charging
me
or
allen
and
hardrick
with
the
pistol
charges,
when
jane
doe
had
the
guns
in
her
bag
and
they
are
really
jane
doe’s
guns.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
it
would
seem
to
me
at
the
very
least
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yeah,
i
certainly
do,
i
certainly
feel
that
at
the
very
least
that
quotation
indicates
that
—
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
i
have
some
theories
in
that
regard
as
to
why,
i
think
that
he
may
not
have
objected
or
why
none
of
the
respondents
did
object
to
the
presumption?
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
absolutely,
but
at
this
point,
the
jury
had
not
yet
been
charged.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
he
was
anticipating
charge
and
you
would
think
anticipating
the
charge,
he
would
also
be
anticipating
the
full
charge,
since
he
was
quite
aware
that
beyond
the
person
presumption
was
included
in
the
statute
and
his
early
motion
indicated
to
some
degree
that
he
felt
that
his
defendants
were
entitled
to
that
charge.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
i
would
not
think
that.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes,
i
would
think
so.
and
he
certainly
made
no
constitutional
objection
even
in
the
earlier
motion
to
dismiss
and
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
what
judge
jason
appeared
to
do
or
what
it
seemed
apparent
is
that
he
did
not
view
a
constitutional
question
as
having
properly
been
raised
and
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
full
text
respondents’
briefs
2
or
3
quotes,
they
were
essentially
the
same
brief
and
it
is
repeated
throughout
the
joint
appendix,
i
think
you
will
see
that,
your
honor
will
see
that
what
--
the
claim
they
were
making
essentially
is
that
not
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
but
that
the
failure
to
grant
them
the
benefit
of
the
exception
was
the
unconstitutional
aspect
and
clearly
they
had
waived
that
by
their
earlier
failure
to
object
to
the
charge.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
pardon
me?
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
we
contended
that
early
in
the
habeas
proceedings,
the
state
did
contend
it,
but
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
it
appears
that
the
waiver,
which
we
argue
would
bar
collateral
review
in
this
court,
would
bar
collateral
review
in
the
state
court
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
proceeding
as
well.
the
only
state
remedy
open
to
him.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
well,
i
think
there
is
a
question
at
this
stage
in
proceeding
to
require
the
respondents
to
go
back
through
a
state
habeas
proceeding,
considering
that
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
no,
i
have
not
your
honor.
i
have
not
raised
exhaustion,
you
know
in
my
petition
of
the
certiorari,
none
of
the
questions.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
the
second
circuit
does
not
seem
to
think
so
but
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
we
are
not
waiving
it.
i
think
what
i
do
--
i
view
it
as
in
this
case
a
futile
exercise
and
i
do
not
think
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
to
ask
these
respondents
to
return
and
go
through
a
state
habeas
proceeding,
since
their
state
direct
appeal
is
completed.
the
only
method,
the
only
state
procedure
they
could
pursue
would
be
a
state
habeas.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
on
the
facial
constitutionality
statute?
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
i
do
not
know
how
they
would
decide
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
it
is
our
point
that
in
effect
they
waived
their
right
and
the
state
court
to
even
raise
the
constitutionality
of
the
presumption.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
that
is
the
point,
it
goes
around
in
a
circle.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes,
that
is
true,
that
is
our
position.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
well,
what
i
think
the
new
york
courts
did
is
that
they
found
that
the
respondents
by
failing
to
object
to
the
charge,
which
in
that
case
incorrectly
embodied
the
statutory
presumption,
has
thereafter
any
waived
any
claims
flowing
from
that
failure.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
no
your
honor.
i
have
never
said
that
at
all
but
once
--
you
cannot
appeal
through
the
state
system,
a
claim
that
you
have
not
presented
at
the
trial.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes
your
honor,
he
will.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
no
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
he
has
waived
his
state
direct
appeal.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
no
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
no,
what
the
new
york
–
what
i
believe
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
and
of
course
the
opinion
is
subject
to
some
interpretation
is
that
it
held
that
having
waived
the
objection
to
the
jury
charge,
which
was
the
embodiment
of
the
statutory
presumption,
the
respondents
waived
all
claims
flowing
from
that
waiver
including
the
facial
claim,
he
has
applied
claim
and
the
state
will
claim.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes.
respondents
--
i
have
just
discussed
the
new
york
court
of
appeals’
opinion.
i
would
like
to
say
that
at
no
stage
in
the
federal
or
state
proceedings,
did
the
respondents
give
a
reason
for
their
failure
to
object.
in
fact,
it
is
not
until
their
brief
to
this
court
that
they
suggest
for
the
first
time
that
the
reason
might
be
inadvertence.
however,
i
would
like
to
say
that
far
being
inadvertence,
the
record
below
lies
in
inadvertence.
the
record
shows
that
the
respondents
knew
the
presumption
would
be
charged,
expected
it
to
be
charged,
that
they
had
a
specific
strategy
and
the
specific
strategy
they
had
was
to
deflect
pressure
away
from
jane
doe
on
the
handgun
charges,
so
that
jane
doe,
a
16-year-old
with
no
prior
record
and
everything
to
gain
and
virtually
nothing
to
lose
would
not
testify
against
them
and
that
is
indeed
what
happened.
the
respondents
give
their
entire
defense
away
from
putting
pressure
on
jane
doe,
away
from
pointing
an
accusatory
finger
at
jane
doe
and
in
fact
the
part
of
allen
and
hardrick’s
charge
that
i
quoted
to
to
the
court
indicates
that
they
were
virtually
conceding
those
counts
rather
than
have
jane
doe
testify
on
the
serious
life
sentence
charge.
and
i
say
this
also
because
it
seems
unlikely
that
counsel,
who
had
so
successfully
defended
these
respondents
on
the
drug
charge;
this
was
actually
by
any
standard
a
very
successful
defense,
would
have
been
unlikely,
particularly
since
they
knew
about
everything
that
was
going
to
happen
at
the
jury
charge
period,
would
be
unlikely
to
overlook
such
an
important
feature.
and
there
is
also
possibly
another
explanation
for
this
waiver,
which
may
come
to
mind
and
that
is
that
these
respondents
were
in
a
sense
willing
to
accept
a
compromise
verdict
to
allow
the
jury
to
convict
them
on
the
lesser
charges
in
the
hopes
of
getting
an
acquittal
on
their
life
sentence
charge.
and
of
course,
respondents
have
a
burden
for
coming
forward
with
a
good
cause,
mere
inadvertence
does
not
satisfy
the
wainwright
v.
sykes
standard,
but
if
either
of
the
theories
that
i
have
proposed
to
the
court
is
supported
by
the
record
and
i
believe
they
are,
these
respondents
have
failed
to
even
meet
the
fay
v.
noia
standard.
if
notwithstanding
the
respondents’
waiver,
the
court
nevertheless
considers
the
constitutionality
of
the
presumption,
the
state
submits
the
statute
as
constitutional.
the
statute
is
a
carefully
drafted
statute,
which
embodies
legislative
recognition
that
illegal
handguns
and
automobiles
are
closely
linked
with
the
commission
of
violent
crimes.
the
presumption
provides
that
presence
in
a
private
automobile
an
illegal
weapon
is
presumptive
evidence
of
its
possession
by
all
the
occupants
of
the
car
unless
one
of
the
exceptions
applies.
there
are
three
exceptions;
there
is
the
on
the
person
exception,
which
this
case
involves,
there
is
an
exception
where
possession
will
not
be
imputed
to
a
taxi
cab
driver,
if
a
gun
is
found
in
the
car
and
the
third
exception
is
if
one
of
the
occupants
of
the
car
not
present
under
duress
has
a
valid
license.
there
are
also
approximately
15
exemptions,
which
are
contained
in
another
statute
265.20
of
the
penal
law.
and
persons
--
these
exemptions
are
the
persons,
who
voluntarily
surrender
handguns
for
example,
or
manufacturers,
shippers,
other
legitimate
firearms’
holders
or
owners.
the
elements
of
the
car
and
the
felonious
weapons
possession,
which
respondents
state
quite
accurately
in
their
petition
for
the
habeas
corpus
in
paragraphs
five
and
six,
is
a
knowing
and
voluntary
possession.
the
requisite
metal
state
must
be
proved
by
evidence
independent
of
the
presumption.
moreover,
new
york
has
a
very
liberal
definition
of
constructive
possession.
the
weapons
must
be
within
the
immediate
control
and
reach
of
the
accused
and
where
it
is
available
for
his
unlawful
use
if
he
so
desires.
so
thus
once
the
requisite
mental
state
of
knowing
involuntary
possession
is
established
through
other
evidence,
the
presumption
simply
permits,
a
jury
can
infer
an
individual
and
close
proximity
to
weapon,
has
that
weapon
within
his
immediate
reach
and
control,
thus
it
merely
of
course
the
evidence,
its
natural
prohibitive
force
in
effect.
in
this
case
--
in
such
a
case
rather,
the
relationship
between
the
proved
fact
and
the
presumed
fact
is
so
close
that
it
must
satisfy
any
test
this
court
deems
appropriate.
and
i
referred
to
the
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
test,
which
is
really
not
that
different
from
the
(inaudible)
test.
finally,
the
statute
focuses
on
narrowly
defined
conduct,
presence
in
a
private
automobile,
as
the
case
has
showed
the
presumption
is
applied
in
a
principle
way
by
the
new
york
courts,
on
a
case-by-case
basis
taking
every
variable
into
consideration.

not,
when
any
contrary
evidence.
if
there
was
contrary
evidence
for
example
that
was
compelling,
the
new
york
judge
certainly
need
not
either
send
the
case
to
the
jury
or
charge
the
jury
on
the
presumption.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
he
did
instruct
on
the
presumption,
he
omitted
the
instruction
on
the
exception.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
there
in
the
charge,
the
judge
does
say
specifically
and
i
do
not
have
the
exact
page
here
that
you
may
disregard
--
court
says,
you
may
find
for
the
respondent
even
though
he
submits
no
evidence
in
rebuttal.
and
then
of
course,
he
went
through
a
very
careful
reasonable
doubt
charge
and
said
but

it
says
the
burden
rest
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
people,
it
never
shifts.
the
defendant
is
never
called
to
establish
his
innocence.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
the
defendants
do
not,
the
charge
is
very
careful
to
state
that
defendants
do
not
have
to
come
forward
with
any
rebuttal
evidence
that
the
jury
could
disregard
the
presumption
and
nevertheless
acquit
the
respondents.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
well,
i
think
it
is
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes.
ms.

i
am
looking
for
it.

bottom
of

of

ms.
eileen
f.

and
he
defines
possession
and
in
terms
of
the
drugs
and
in
terms
of
the
gun.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
the
new
york
law
is
if
substantial
evidence
is
introduced
to
rebut
the
presumption,
then
the
presumption
need
not
go
to
the
jury.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
probably
so
and
there
was
no
effort
made
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
for
example
to
rebut
the
presumption.
ms.

stolen
property
as
in

ms.
eileen

but
any
inference
would
and
--
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
well,
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
end
of
my
main
brief,
i
think
that
the
new
york,
the
practice
in
the
new
york
courts
in
any
event
is
to
employ
the
statute
permissively
and
so
it
is
more
like
an
inference
than
like
a
statutory
presumption
for
example,
some
of
the
federal
cases
that
this
court
has
examined.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
pardon
me?
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
well,
the
sullivan

your
honor,
referred

an
entire
range
of
firearms
protection
devices.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
oh,
you
mean
the
1936
statute?
the
1936
statute
prior
to
adding
one
of
the
exceptions?
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
eileen
f.
shapiro
yes
your
honor.
