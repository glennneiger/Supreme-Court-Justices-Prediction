justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
was
there
ever
exhaustion
of
the
statement
remidies
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
contend
that
there
was
no
exhaustion
of
statement
remedies
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
have
you
abandoned
that
claim
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
this
question
was
never
presented
in
the
state
courts?
has
the
federal’s
habeas
statute
been
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
one
of
the
questions
you
have
raised
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
state
in
position
to
waive
that,
this
federal
statutory
requirement,
may
a
state
waive
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
a
futile
exercise?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
decide
on
this
question
if
it
was
never
presented
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
direct
appeal.
if
you
say
if
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
did
not
pass
on
this
question,
if
it
was
never
presented
to
them,
how
do
you
know
how
they
would
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
do
you
mean
it
is
a
futile
exercise
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
to
me
that,
maybe
you
are
quite
right
that
the
person
who
is
convicted
in
a
state
trial
court
can
completely
abandon
his
appeal
in
the
state
system
and
come
directly
into
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
let
us
assume
a
person
is
convicted
in
a
new
york
trial
court,
he
just
does
not
appeal
and
then
he
goes
to
state
habeas,
he
will
be
thrown
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
he
then
come
to
this
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
not
that
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
this
case,
what
about
this
particular
question
in
about
the
facial
constitutionality
of
this
presumption
if
–
let
us
assume
it
was
never
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york,
although
it
could
have
been
and
it
was
not
and
it
was
not
decided
by
them
and
it
may
not
be
available
in
state
habeas,
but
is
it
available
in
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
that
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
new
york
is
one
of
those
states
that
purports
to
say
that
if
the
presumption
disappears
and
you
just
disregard
it,
when
any
contrary
evidence
suddenly
comes
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
apparently,
he
thought
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence,
but
he
did
instruct
on
the
presumption?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
he
told
the
jury
that
they
could
ignore
the
presumption
if
they
wanted
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendant
need
not
have
to
prove
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
went
onto
instruct
on
presumption.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
part
of
the
instruction
is
correct?
the
presumption
or
presumptions
is
effective
only
so
long
as
there
is
no
substantial
evidence,
opinion
--
conclusion
flowing
from
the
presumption
and
the
presumption
is
set
to
disappear
when
such
contradictory
evidence
is
adduced.
is
that
the
new
york
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
must
have
been
his
opinion
if
there
had
not
been
any
substantial
evidence
on
the
contrary
side
or
there
would
not
have
been
any
presumption
instruction
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
federal
constitutional
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
saying
that
the
trial
court
was
obligated
to
decide
your
submission
here
in
terms
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
okay
then
where
is
your
submission
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
did
you
rely
on
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
not
say
so
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
40a.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
new
york,
court
of
appeals
agree
with
you
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
documents
that
used
to
be
entitled
brief
for
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
does
not
mean
that
anybody
says
there
was
a
proof
just
means
there
is
no
more
proofs
than
the
fact
the
gun
and
the
defendant
were
both
in
the
same
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
does
not
mean
there
is
no
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
are
arguing
is
that
you
should
not
be
able
to
infer
possession
from
the
presence
of
the
gun
and
the
defendant
in
the
car
at
the
same
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
conclude
that
they
have
come
back
with
a
guilty
verdict,
they
would
have
violated
their
instructions
unless
they
have
found
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
every
member
in
the
car
possessed
the
gun?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
presumption,
well,
they
have
been
told
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
unless
they
find
the
status
prove
the
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
may
be
the
presumption
under
the
so
called
inference
is
part
of
the
truth,
but
they
nevertheless
have
to
be
convinced.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
jury
nevertheless,
it's
presumptive
evidence
that
is
true,
but
nevertheless
it
has
to
be
evidence
that
will
convince
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
is
the
instruction.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
just
means
it
is
enough
to
get
to
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
jury
–
yeah,
but
the
jury
nevertheless
has
to
be
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
is
the
way
it
was
instructed
and
say,
find
the
defendant
guilty,
without
finding
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
they
have
violated
their
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
whatever
the
evidence
is,
it
has
to
convince
them
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
they
don’t
suggest
it,
they
did
not
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
have
to
find
him
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now
you
cannot
construe
the
constructions
any
other
way,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
had,
why
do
not
you
come
up
here
and
claim
that
some
other
section
of
the
constitution
has
been
violated,
that
they
have
violated
the
beyond
reasonable
doubt
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
does
not
–
that
isn't
the
question
you
presented
to
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
you
really
objecting
to
on
a
sixth
amendment
basis
that
they
really
interfered
with
your
right
to
a
jury
trial?
