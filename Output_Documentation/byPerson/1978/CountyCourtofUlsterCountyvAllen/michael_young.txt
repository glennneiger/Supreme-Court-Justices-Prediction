mr.
michael
young
in
response
to
that,
i
would
like
to
clear
something
up
your
honor.
the
petitioners
insisted
that
the
respondents
never
raised
their
constitutional
claim
in
the
state
courts,
that
is
simply
incorrect.
mr.
michael
young
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
young
not
on
grounds
which
were
available
to
the
petitioner
at
the
time
he
could
have
taken
his
direct
appeal.
mr.
michael
young
yes
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
michael
young
which
is
that
this
direct
appeal
fully
raised
the
issue
we
are
talking
about
right
here.
and
i
would
like
to
take
your
honor
through
the
documents,
which
are
relevant
to
that
fact
because
frankly
what
ms.
shapiro
was
describing,
i
am
not
sure
we
are
talking
about
the
same
case.
petitioner's
first
challenge
--
mr.
michael
young
[attempt
to
laughter]
well,
i
hope
i
can
clear
this
up.
petitioners
or
the
respondents,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
change,
i
am
usually
a
petitioner’s
representative,
so
i
may
make
a
slip
of
the
tongue,
the
respondents,
the
defendants
in
this
case
first
challenged
the
presumption
in
this
case
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
in
the
state
proceedings.
that
challenge
was
a
general
challenge.
it
came
at
the
end
of
the
government’s
case.
mr.
michael
young
that
set
forth
on
pages
12a
to
17a
of
the
appendix,
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case.
now,
that
challenge,
we
can
see
did
not
spell
out
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
michael
young
sure.
let's
see,
i
believe
on
page
14a,
we
get
into
it
most
exactly.
mr.
michael
young
yes,
your
honor,
we
concede
that.
all
that
we
are
pointing
out
about
that
is
that
the
presumption
was
challenged
in
general
terms
at
that
point
because
the
constitutional
challenge
comes
forth
very
clearly
later
on
in
the
trial
proceedings.
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
that
is
the
first
instance
when
the
respondent
said,
hey,
we
do
not
think
that
this
presumption
is
applicable
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
young
applicable
and
most
importantly
--
mr.
michael
young
alright.
the
federal
constitutional
claim
is
set
forth
for
the
first
time
in
the
appendix
at
pages,
see
36a,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
young
that
is
a
motion
to
set
aside
a
verdict,
which
is
specifically
authorized
under
section
330.30
of
the
new
york
civil
procedure
law
and
it
is
appropriate
at
that
time
your
honor
because
this
is
not
a
charged
case,
this
is
not
the
case
in
which
we
are
simply
arguing
that
if
the
judge
had
charged
the
jury
differently
that
everything
would
have
been
alright.
this
is
a
case
of
failure
of
proof.
it
is
a
case
where
the
state
admitted
that
it
has
no
proof
that
the
defendants
possessed
the
guns.
mr.
michael
young
the
constitutional
issue,
yes
your
honor,
but
before
judgment.
mr.
michael
young
yes
your
honor.
the
trial
court
was
obligated
at
this
point
just
as
it
would
have
been
at
any
point
during
the
trail
when
this
issue
could
have
been
raised.
the
trial
court
was
obligated
to
dismiss
the
charges,
not
simply
to
instruct
the
jury
differently
or
to
tell
--
mr.
michael
young
alright,
that
is
on
page
36a
in
which
the
respondents
specifically
stated,
secondly,
if
the
presumption
is
applicable
--
mr.
michael
young
on
page
36a
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
is
the
tan
document.
mr.
michael
young
well,
they
do
not
suggest
that
the
new
york
case
would
be
different,
they
say
that
it
is
the
same.
mr.
michael
young
well,
maybe
more
demanding
and
in
fact.
mr.
michael
young
we
also
cite
new
jersey
cases
your
honor.
we
are
pointing
out
that
nationally
--
mr.
michael
young
the
leary’s
due
process
test
your
honor.
mr.
michael
young
no
your
honor,
but
we
do
say
unconstitutional
as
applied,
and
then
immediately
cite
the
leary
and
there
can't
be
any
question,
there
couldn't
have
been
any
question
in
the
state's
mind
that
we
are
referring
to
the
federal
constitutional
test
that
that's
set
forth
in
leary.
in
fact,
on
appeal
in
this
case,
every
time
this
argument
was
raised,
the
state
did
not
respond
by
saying,
oh,
no,
the
state
constitution
allows
this.
they
responded
by
saying,
no,
leary
allows
this.
so,
they
recognized
the
claim
as
being
federally
based
just
as
we
did.
mr.
michael
young
well,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
the
dissenters
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
make
reference.
mr.
michael
young
well,
it
is
our
—
mr.
michael
young
no,
but
leary
only
applies
to
the
federal
constitution
your
honor
and
i
think
it
is
fairly
common
practice
that
if
you
are
trying
to
raise
the
constitutional
claim,
if
you
say
it
is
unconstitutional
and
then
cite
to
the
controlling
—
mr.
michael
young
then
defense
counsel
was
less
than
explicit,
but
if
the
purpose
of
that
rule
is
to
make
clear
to
everyone
involved
what
is
being
relied
on
and
that
is
what
i
think
bryant
versus
zimmerman
and
those
cases
say
that
the
intent
of
specifying
what
you
are
relying
on
is
so
that
nobody
has
any
question
whether
it
is
a
federal
constitution
versus
a
state
constitution.
there
could
have
been
any
question
in
this
case
because
leary
does
not
apply
a
state
test.
mr.
michael
young
no,
but
your
honor
as
i
said
leary
--
mr.
michael
young
but
your
honor,
the
point
is
that
leary
does
refer
to
the
--
suppose
the
respondents
have
simply
said
that
it
is
unconstitutional
under
leary,
would
not
that
clearly
say
what
we
are
referring
to
as
the
[voice
overlap]
process?
mr.
michael
young
alright.
the
second
circuit,
looking
at
that
opinion
said
that
it
is
clear
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
considered
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
michael
young
alright,
it
did
not
--
what
it
did
was
in
the
first
paragraphs
where
it
discusses
how
important
this
presumption
is,
how
necessarily
it
is
to
the
activities
of
criminal
justice.
mr.
michael
young
no,
judge
jason’s
opinion,
i
may
be
mistaken
by
it.
mr.
michael
young
no,
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
implicitly
decided
the
constitutional
--
mr.
michael
young
alright.
that
decision
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
for
the
petition.
i
am
trying
to
find
the
beginning
of
it
now.
mr.
michael
young
alright.
we
submit
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
what
happened
here
was
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
decided
in
a
score
of
cases
over
the
last
several
decades
that
this
presumption
was
constitutional.
and
therefore,
it
did
not
spend,
it
did
not
expressly
address
that
issue
in
this
case.
so
what
it
did
was
simply
note
in
passing
as
judge
jason
does
that
this
presumption
and
he
says,
starting
at
43a
he
begins
to
discuss
the
presumption,
and
he
points
out
that
the
presumption
was
enacted
because
of
difficulties
in
proving
weapon's
possession
without
it
and
because
that
therefore
the
urgent
need
for
legislation
to
make
the
presence
of
a
forbidden
weapon,
presumptive
evidence
of
its
possession
and
that
such
a
moment
would
require
the
occupants
of
the
automobile
to
explain
the
presence
of
the
firearm
that
therefore
this
presumption
was
enacted
providing
that
all
persons
in
an
automobile
at
the
time
are
presumed
to
possess.
the
point
is
what
the
court
was
saying
is
this
is
a
valid
presumption.
mr.
michael
young
alright,
but
we
argued
unconstitutionality
in
that
quote,
in
our
quote
of
that
brief.
the
court
can't
avoid
an
issue
by
simply
not
responding
to
it.
mr.
michael
young
alright,
let
us
look
directly
to
that
issue
then.
we
submit
that,
that
motion
was
entirely
timely
to
raise
this
issue
for
several
points.
just
let
me
find
my
--
mr.
michael
young
new
york
court
of
appeals
never
said
that
the
constitutional
claim
had
been
waived.
they
only
said
that
a
state
law
claim
concerning
whether
or
not
the
on
the
person
exception
to
this
presumption
was
controlling
as
a
matter
of
state
law
had
been
waived
by
the
failure
to
object
to
the
judge’s
charge.
they
never
said
that
the
constitutional
claim
had
been
waived
and
there
are
several
reasons
why
they
did
not
say
that.
mr.
michael
young
well,
your
honor,
it
is
hard
to
say
that
it
was
argued
in
passing
when
it
specifically
said
secondly
if
the
presumption
is
--
mr.
michael
young
no,
but
well
you
do
actually
in
the
part
addressing
the
state,
the
state
argued
that
it
was
a
constitutional
presumption.
mr.
michael
young
yes,
if
you
look
at
the
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that's
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page,
let
us
see
--
mr.
michael
young
40,
well
50a
is
when
the
constitutional
part
of
that
is
submitted.
mr.
michael
young
50a
and
there
again,
the
respondents
plainly
stated
secondly,
if
the
presumption
is
applicable
here
that
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied.
in
essence
they
used
exactly
the
same
argument
that
they
had
used
in
their
motion
to
set
aside
a
verdict,
namely
the
federal
--
mr.
michael
young
we
will
argue
that
that
was
preserved
your
honor
for
two
reasons.
one
is
this
presumption
has
had
a
history
over
the
three
decades
since
it
was
enacted
of
being
held
facially
constitutional
by
new
york’s
highest
court.
now,
2254
only
requires
you
to
exhaust
effective
state
remedies
before
raising
an
issue
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
and
this
court
and
every
circuit
court
has
interpreted
that
phrase
to
mean
that
where
an
issue
has
been
squarely
decided
by
the
state's
highest
court
in
previous
cases
that
a
petitioner
is
not
required
to
argue
it
again
in
the
states'
courts
before
raising
it
in
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
michael
young
well,
first
of
all,
let
us
take
it
on
two
stages.
first
of
all,
it
is
clear
that
the
respondents
raised
a
constitutional
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
set
forth
on
50a,
the
part
of
our
brief,
that
is
set
forth
on
50a.
we
submit
as
the
second
circuit
found
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
not
expressly
address
the
constitutional
issue
because
that
it
decided
it
in
so
many
previous
cases.
therefore,
it
only
noted
in
passing
how
important
this
presumption
was,
and
then
went
on
to
address
the
respondent’s
state
law
argument
because
that
is
what
the
defenders
in
the
new
york
appellate
division
had
agreed
with
the
respondents
on.
so,
in
other
words,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
essence
said,
we
have
decided
15
times
already
that
this
statute
is
constitutional.
we
are
not
going
to
do
a
lengthy
analysis
of
that
now.
all
we
are
going
to
do
is
note
that
this
presumption
has
a
pressing
need
that
it
was
enacted
because
of
certain
problems
dealing
with
criminal
justice
and
now
we
are
going
to
go
on
and
address
the
problem
that
troubled
the
appellate
division
dissenters.
that
is
how
that
opinion
looks,
but
like
i
said,
even
if
they
had
not
made
any
reference
to
the
need
for
the
presumption,
we
raised
the
issue
and
they
can
not
duck
it.
mr.
michael
young
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
young
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
michael
young
yes,
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
is
set
forth
in
the
petition,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals’
opinion
is
set
forth
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
michael
young
okay,
the
page
is,
i
have
to
find
it
again.
mr.
michael
young
yeah,
it
still
is
on
mind,
but
it's
filled
on
with
most
finger
prints
on
it
since
it
has
been
used
the
longest.
alright,
that
set
forth,
the
part
about
the
presumption
starts
on
page
43a
and
continues
through
the
end
of
the
opinion,
which
as
long
as
i
guess
to
53a.
mr.
michael
young
no,
i
am
saying
that
that
is
why
they
did
not
expressively
address
it
here
is
because
it
had
been
--
mr.
michael
young
oh,
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
did
not
mean
to
do
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
this
is
in
so
many
previous
issues
that
all
they
did
in
this
opinion
--
mr.
michael
young
well,
it
was
enough
for
the
second
circuit.
the
second
circuit
cycle
analyze
it
the
same
way
your
honor.
they
found
that
it
was
clear.
mr.
michael
young
[attempt
to
laughter]
well,
they
thought
that
it
was
clear
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
only
found
waivers.
mr.
michael
young
it
does
not
expressly
address
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
michael
young
no,
i
would
cite
to
the
fact
that
respondents
raised
the
constitutional
issue
and
that
since
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
expressly
address
it,
but
did
say
that
they
felt
that
this
presumption
was
valid
--
mr.
michael
young
alright,
on
pages
--
mr.
michael
young
41
--
43
through
45.
mr.
michael
young
yes,
i
believe
that
is
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
judge
walker’s
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
says
that
constitutional
challenges
have
been
rejected
in
the
past
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
judge
walker
felt
that
this
presumption
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
young
well,
it
definitely
--
mr.
michael
young
well,
it
does
suggest
that
the
issue
was
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
young
but
since
judge
walker
found
it
unconstitutional
here
in
this
case
your
honor,
referring
back
to
terra,
he
was
clearly
saying
that
it
is
an
issue
here
too.
but
getting
back
to
the
point
that
i
was
initially
making
with
you
your
honor,
justice
rehnquist,
even
though
the
court
did
not
spell
out,
even
though
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
not
spell
out
or
converse,
what
their
position
was
on
the
constitutional
issue,
that
does
not
mean
that
we
are
precluded
from
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
all
we
have
to
do
is
exhaust
our
remedies
in
the
state
court.
we
only
have
to
raise
the
issue.
if
the
court
of
appeals
refuses
to
confront
it,
that
is
not
our
fault
and
that
does
not
preclude
us
under
2254
from
raising
that
issue
thereafter
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
michael
young
alright,
your
honor,
again
you
phrase
that
in
terms
of
this
being
a
charge
case.
even
if
the
judge,
in
this
case
had
made
no
mention
whatsoever
of
this
presumption,
even
if
he
had
never
told
the
jury
that
they
can
convict
on
the
basis
of
this
presumption,
respondents
would
still
be
entitled
to
the
relief,
which
they
have
been
granted.
that
is
so
because
the
state
in
this
case
rested
their
case
without
any
actual
proof
of
the
crime
charged.
instead
they
relied
solely
on
this
presumption.
i
would
like
to
refer
your
honor
to
the
colloquy
that
occurred
at
the
end
of
the
state’s
case
on
exactly
that.
the
defense
counsel
had
argued
that
the
presumption
wasn't
valid
in
this
case;
admittedly
they
did
not
raise
a
constitutional
claim
at
that
point.
what
is
important
is
that
they
argued
that
it
was
not
valid.
and
in
response,
the
court
turned
to
the
prosecutor
and
said
referring
to
defense
counsel’s
argument,
he
is
saying
that
the
only
proof
you
have
again
is
your
presumption,
right?
the
prosecutor
-
correct.
the
court
-
the
defender
was
in
the
car
and
the
statute
presumes
you
have
no
other
proof.
the
prosecutor
-
correct.
so
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
simply
was
no
proof
and
defendants
right,
their
constitutional
right
attached
at
that
point.
mr.
michael
young
well,
i
think
the
last
comment
by
the
court
makes
that
clear.
he
says,
you
have
no
other
proof,
asking
question,
there
is
the
question
mark
after
that
--
mr.
michael
young
oh,
i
am
sorry,
page
15a,
bottom
of
14a,
the
last
three
lines
of
14a
and
the
first
three
lines
of
15a.
mr.
michael
young
that
is
right
and
that
is
why
--
mr.
michael
young
well,
it
does
that
the
presumption
--
mr.
michael
young
that
is
right
your
honor.
and
if
you
can't
constitutionally
do
that,
then
the
prosecution’s
case
necessarily
falls
at
that
point.
mr.
michael
young
well,
then
they
would
not
be
relying
on
the
presumption.
mr.
michael
young
right,
but
here
they
have
admitted
that
they
were
relying
solely
on
the
presumption.
mr.
michael
young
well,
that
is
what
the
judge
i
think
should
have
said,
in
this
case,
at
this
point.
mr.
michael
young
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
quite
understand.
mr.
michael
young
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
defendants’
due
process
rights
were
violated
at
the
point
that
the
state
rested
its
case
without
presenting
any
actual
proof
of
possession
but
instead
relying
solely
on
this
presumption.
so
if
this
presumption
is
unconstitutional,
defendants’
rights
were
violated
at
that
point
no
matter
what
the
judge
thereafter
charged
the
jury,
even
if
the
judge
had
charged
the
jury
that
they
could
not
convict
on
the
basis
of
the
presumption.
mr.
michael
young
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
michael
young
oh,
you
caught
me
totally
unawares,
it
is
long
since
long
as
i
read
the
transcript,
i
am
not
sure,
i
do
not
think
any
of
the
defendants
--
mr.
michael
young
i
think
a
police
officer
testified
that
she
had
made
that
admission
your
honor.
mr.
michael
young
only
evidence
of
doe's
possession
and
doe
was
not
a
respondent
here.
mr.
michael
young
well
essentially
all
--
mr.
michael
young
no
that
was
essentially
it,
as
to
these
–
as
to
the
respondents
--
mr.
michael
young
oh
you
mean
that
it
is
a
bad
evidence,
yes
that
does
not
apply
to
the
respondents,
it
only
applies
to
jane
doe.
mr.
michael
young
yes,
the
court
referring
to
the
argument
defense
counsel
had
just
made,
he
is
saying
that
the
only
proof
you
have
again
is
your
presumption,
right?
[inaudible]
and
the
prosecutor
-
correct.
mr.
michael
young
yes,
that
is
all
the
evidence
that
they
have.
mr.
michael
young
well,
his
next
comment
is
the
court
-
the
defendant
was
in
the
car
and
the
statute
presumes,
you
have
no
other
proof?
and
the
prosecutor
-
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
young
in
plain
sight
to
the
police
officer,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
young
no,
because
they
were
in
between
the
right
front
seat
and
the
right
front
car
door,
next
to
which
jane
doe
was
sitting,
so
between
the
seat
and
jane
doe,
they
were
totally
out
of
sight
of
everybody
else
in
the
car.
there
is
no
testimony
to
the
effect
that
anybody
else
in
that
car
could
have
seen
those
guns
and
logically
they
could
not
have
seen
them
because
they
were
all
the
way
over
there.
mr.
michael
young
well,
number
one
i
do
not
thing
that,
that
is
a
reason
to
inference,
but
number
two,
sight
is
not
all
that
is
required
for
possession,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
young
yes.
mr.
michael
young
right,
one
gun
was
totally
out
of
sight
because
the
police
officer
did
not
even
see
it
until
he
had
removed
the
first
gun.
the
first
gun
was
in
sight
only
in
that
the
handle
was
sticking
out
of
the
top
of
the
purse
that
was
located
in
that
location.
i
think
it
would
be
a
pretty
strange
--
mr.
michael
young
as
to
the
bottom
gun?
mr.
michael
young
alright,
but
they
were
convicted
of
both
guns.
so
even
if
sight
alone
was
enough
to
convict
here,
it
would
not
justify
the
conviction
on
the
second
gun.
mr.
michael
young
well,
the
presumption
was
used
to
convict
for
both.
so,
obviously
the
issue
would
be
raised
as
to
the
second
gun
even
if
your
honor
were
correct
in
saying
the
mere
--
that
the
first
gun
was
visible
and
moreover
to
visibility
permitted
a
conviction
simply
because
it
was
visible.
now
we
strongly
disagree
with
that.
we
do
not
think
that
visibility,
that
even
if
the
gun
was
visible
to
the
other
passengers,
that
is
enough.
it
simply
strained
the
imagination
to
say
that
simply
because
the
gun
was
visible
that
all
of
the
people
in
the
car
automatically
possessed
it
because
it
was
visible.
mr.
michael
young
no
your
honor,
the
reason
i
know
is
visibility,
yes.
mr.
michael
young
but
let
us
look
at
exactly
what
the
presumption
--
mr.
michael
young
alright,
no
they
do
not,
but
let
us
look
at
what
the
presumption
means
because
it
does
not
mean
what
ms.
shapiro
described
to
you.
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
uniformly
held
that
this
presumption
authorizes
a
jury,
if
they
so
wish
in
most
instances
to
infer
possession
of
a
gun
to
anyone
who
is
present
in
the
car
where
that
gun
is
found.
mr.
michael
young
well
that
is
not
–
mr.
michael
young
well
then
your
honor,
let
us
look
at
page
25
of
the
joint
appendix
which
contains
the
part
of
the
judge’s
charge
addressing
the
presumption
and
there
his
lead
of
statement
is
our
penal
law
also
provides
that
the
presence
in
an
automobile
of
any
handgun
or
firearm
which
is
loaded
is
presumptive
evidence
of
their
unlawful
possession.
so
that
alone
could
be
--
mr.
michael
young
well,
according
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
this
court
is
bound
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals’
interpretation
of
the
statute,
new
york
court
of
appeals
states
in
their
opinion
in
this
very
case
that
the
presumption
creates
a
prima
facial
case
against
the
defendant.
now,
it
is
my
understanding
--
mr.
michael
young
that
is
right,
enough
to
convict
on.
mr.
michael
young
yes
but
based
on
--
mr.
michael
young
and
the
judge
was
telling
them
that
they
could
reach
their
conclusion
based
only
on
this
presumption.
mr.
michael
young
no,
they
did
not
have
to.
mr.
michael
young
yes,
i
can
well,
i
can
construe
those
together.
mr.
michael
young
well
to
a
certain
extent,
this
does
because
it
--
mr.
michael
young
i
know
because
we
do
not
feel
that,
that
is
the
central
issue
here.
what
we
feel
as
a
central
issue
is
that
the
due
process
rights
were
violated
because
the
jurors
were
instructed
that
they
could
draw
an
irrational
inference
and
as
this
court
had
said
in
every
presumption
case
it
has
dealt
with,
that
is
enough
to
violate
the
defendants’
rights.
you
do
not
have
to
also
violate
the
rights
by
mis-instructing
them
as
to
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
in
every
one
of
the
presumption
cases
where
this
court
has
reversed
the
conviction
because
the
presumption
was
irrational,
the
juries
were
charged
that
they
had
to
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
those
cases.
so
it
is
not
enough
that
they
were
instructed
on
reasonable
doubt
in
this
case.
what
is
important
is
that
the
prosecutor
rested
this
case
solely
on
the
basis
--
mr.
michael
young
there
are
implications
of
that
your
honor.
it
is
more
a
due
process
violation
under
leary.
what
the
judge
has
said
is
the
jury
does
not
have
to
be
rational.
mr.
michael
young
pardon
me.
mr.
michael
young
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
michael
young
well
i
--
mr.
michael
young
pardon
me.
mr.
michael
young
no,
all
the
issues
that
we
are
talking
about
now
were
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
young
pardon
mr.
michael
young
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
michael
young
alright,
thank
you
your
honor.
