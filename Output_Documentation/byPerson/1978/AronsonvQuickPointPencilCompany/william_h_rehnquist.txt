justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
grossman,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
are
contracts
which
would
be
enforceable
under
state
law,
which
do
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
but
which
would
nevertheless
be
preempted
by
what
you
referred
to
as
federal
competition
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
other
federal
policies
such
as
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
would
be
the
laws
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
one
looks
to
find
federal
patent
policy,
i
take
it
in
the
laws
enacted
by
congress
pursuant
to
the
patents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
presume
the
source
of
this
court's
knowledge
on
that
subject
must
be
the
acts
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
cannot--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
griswold
does
the
authority
of
the
state
to
enforce
its
own
contract
laws
depend
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
trade
secret?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
terms
of
the
contract
did
require
payment
of
two-and-half
percent
of
the
royalties
regardless
of
whether
or
not
a
patent
is
issued?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
client
in
the
contract
took
the
risk
of
the
non-patentability,
didn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
federal
law
as
you
say
precludes
the
enforcement
of
such
a
contract
but
certainly
the
contract
by
its
terms
would
seem
to
indicate
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
important
public
policy
objectives
of
the
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
we
assume
that
if
the
state
of
missouri
or
whatever
state
this
contract
was
drawn
and
chose
to
enforce
this
contract.
they've
--
it
viewed
it
as
serving
important
public
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
sole
issue
also
whether
federal
patent
law
preempts
state
law
enforcing
this
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
griswold,
do
you
consider
kewanee
and
goldstein
teaching
cases
as
well
as
brulotte
and
compco?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
should
think
you
would
be.
[laughter]
