chief

e.

we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
aronson
against
quick
point
pencil
company.
mr.
cook,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
that
relevant
to
the
contract
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view
mr.
cook,
would
the
case
be
any
different?
if
no
patent
had
been
applied
for,
but
the
idea
that
might
have
been
presented
to
the
respondent
company
and
then
they
made
the
agreement
for
either
a
2.5%
straight
or
whatever.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
some
inventions,
the
copying
of
it
is
not
easy,
because
the
content
is
discernible.
is
it
not
true
that
some
companies
even
having
a
patentable
item
do
not
patent
it
but
simply
seek
to
preempt
the
market
â€“
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
without
any
patent
so
that
they
don't
have
to
disclose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
very
well,
mr.
cook.
mr.
grossman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
the
contrary
precisely
what
the
opposing
parties
relying
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
that
is
anomalable,
because
he
had
no
monopoly,
if
she
had
not
monopoly
to
sell?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
grossman,
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
griswold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
had
assumed
mr.
griswold
that
the
case
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
all
the
others
were
the
same
or
could
be
the
same
because
there
was
no
monopoly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
suggest
that
by
way
of
argument
that
it
was
never
patentable
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
griswold,
i
wonder
would
it
be
irrational
in
your
view
to
treat
this
transaction
between
the
two
parties
as
being
made
up
of
two
contracts,
one
contract
if
the
5%,
if
the
patent
issued
another
contract
to
pay
two-and-half
percent
if
they
didn't
get
a
patent
within
five
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
different
days,
literally
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
really
know
whether
she
is
in
a
better
position?
what
about
the
exclusive
right
to
get
royalties
from
licensees
from
the
whole
market?
obviously
great
many
people
copied
this
idea
and
had
it
been
patentable,
all
of
these
others
or
many
of
them
might
have
had
to
pay
a
royalty,
the
license
fee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
would
have
maintained
--
her
payments
would
have
remained
at
5%
throughout
the
17
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
by
the
same
token
doesn't
this
what
we
were
just
discussing
indicate
that
the
parties
contracted
with
the
view
to
the
possibility
if
not
the
likelihood
that
there
would
be
no
patent
obtained?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
reduction
of
two-and-half
percent
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
mr.
griswold
that
when
she
came
to
this
company
no
patent
application
was
pending
and
they
made
exactly
the
same
contract
that
was
made,
but
that
she
never
applied
for
a
patent
and
assume
no
obligation
to
apply
was
in
the
contract.
how
will
that
be
any
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
she
then
be
exploiting
or
making
any
use
of
the
patent
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
that
case
over
the
20
years
or
more
the
royalties
would
have
been
far
in
excess
of
$203,000
on
this
market
rate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
this
case.
she
would
have
had
as
i
suggested
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
isn't
so
difficult,
you
just
take
the
period
after
the
5
years
and
double
the
royalties
and
add
that
to
the
203
and
then
add
if
you
could
calculate
it,
so
all
the
people
who
copied
the
idea
would
have
to
pay
license
fees.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
counselor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
griswold
has
suggested
that
there
is
at
least
a
late
wind
in
her
sales
by
virtue
of
being
able
to
put
the
statement
patent
pending
normally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
chief
reason
why
the
party
--
why
they
have
a
reduction
in
the
patent
--
patent
royalty
from
5%
to
2.5%
because
two
arm's-length
parties
agreed
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
doesn't
really
make
much
difference
or
does
it,
why
they
agreed
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
for
announcement
the
disposition
of
number
1413,
aronson
against
quick
point
pencil
company
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning
and
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
