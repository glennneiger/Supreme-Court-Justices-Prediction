mr.
b.
barry
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
you
today
is
whether
state
laws,
which
enforce
contracts
of
the
type
here
at
issue,
which
so
significantly
impede
federal
pattern
or
competition
policy
as
to
require
preemption.
preemption
issues
of
this
type
have
been
resolved
by
the
court
by
defining
the
specific
federal
pattern
and
competition
policies
articulated
by
congress
and
carefully
analyzing
the
impact
on
such
policies
that
would
result
from
enforcement
under
state
law
of
various
types
of
contract
or
procedural
rights.
applying
such
analysis
to
this
case,
united
states
has
concluded
that
enforcement
of
the
contracts
such
as
that
entered
into
between
mrs.
aronson
and
quick
point
would
not
adversely
impact
any
federal
policy.
on
the
contrary,
we
believe
that
the
availability
of
such
contractual
means
of
rewarding
inventors
will
foster
the
achievement
of
innovation,
rapid
disclosure
of
new
ideas,
and
new
entry
into
commercial
markets,
goes
at
the
very
heart
of
federal
pattern
and
competition
policy.
since
petitioner's
counsel
has
devoted
most
of
his
remarks
to
pattern
policy,
i
should
like
to
start
my
remarks
with
a
discussion
of
the
impact
of
this
contract
on
federal
competition
policy.
contracts
of
the
type
which
concern
us
today
pose
no
danger
to
federal
competition
policy
that
cannot
be
checked
by
the
normal
application
of
the
antitrust
laws.
statements
by
respondent
to
the
effect
that
enforcement
of
the
contract
will
promote
monopoly
in
contrast
to
free
competition
portray
a
misunderstanding
of
both
of
those
consents.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
no,
i
do
not
make
that
suggestion.
i
mean,
it
is
conceivable
that
contracts
enforceable
under
state
law
could
violate
federal
antitrust
policy.
for
example,
a
requirements
contract,
which
under
the
antitrust
standard,
would
foreclose
an
unreasonable
portion
of
the
market.
they
could
be
enforceable
under
state
law,
but
violative
of
the
antitrust
law.
one
could
ever
contract
that
would
not
be
violative
of
antitrust
laws,
but
would
nevertheless
frustrate
federal
patent
policy,
but
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
is
some
level
of
impact
on
competition
beneath
the
dignity
as
it
were
of
an
antitrust
violation
that
would
nevertheless
require
preemption,
unless
it
frustrated
some
other
federal
policy.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
the
patent
policy
for
this
case.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
in
terms
of
–
the
patent
policy
and
antitrust
policy
are
complementary
here,
it
is
conceivable,
of
course
that
one
could
have
a
situation
in
which
federal
patent
policy
would
be
frustrated
even
though
antitrust
policy
might
not
be.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
that's
right.
basically
the
primary
goals
of
patent
policy
as
articulated
by
this
court
have
been
the
promotion
of
innovation,
the
facilitation
of
rapid
disclosure
of
new
ideas
and
the
preservations
of
ideas
in
the
public
domain
and
protection
of
those
ideas
from
monopoly
confirmed.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
i
can
think
of
no
other
source.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
it
is
not
clear
to
me
what
monopoly
could
be
referred
to
here.
certainly
the
enforcement
of
the
contract
here
at
issue
does
not
confer
any
monopoly
in
the
sense
of
a
right
to
exclusive
views
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
patent
laws.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
the
fact
that
they
are
being
faced
with
what
they
believe
to
be
unfair
competition
is
precisely
the
opposite
or
the
--
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
that's
right
your
honor.
nor
does
this
case
involve
monopoly
power
in
the
sense
that
it
is
used
under
the
antitrust
laws,
namely
the
power
to
control
price
or
forestall
entries.
the
degree
of
market
power
conferred
on
a
licensee,
a
commercially
valuable
idea,
will
depend
on
a
number
of
factors,
including
the
degree
to
which
the
product
is
differentiated
in
different
or
competing
products,
the
degree
to
which
the
idea
can
be
easily
ascertained
and
used
by
competitors,
and
the
extent
to
which
competitors
have
offsetting
advantages
relative
to
the
licensee.
now
we
don't
suggest
that
indeterminate
licenses
of
commercially
usual
ideas
could
never
contravene
federal
antitrust
policy.
what
we
do
suggest
is
that
the
likelihood
is
not
so
great
as
to
warn
what
is
the
equivalent
to
an
antitrust
rule
of
per
se
illegality
implemented
in
the
form
of
patent
preemption
of
state
contract
law.
our
policy
of
free
competition
does
not
mandate
competition
free
of
any
and
all
contractual
restrains.
only
those
restrains,
which
are
deemed
unreasonable,
are
prohibited.
economic
analysis
did
not
indicate
that
licenses
of
the
type
here
at
issue
inherently
restrain
competition.
moreover,
we
lack
experience
or
evidence,
which
would
indicate
that
such
contracts
will
unreasonably
restrain
trade
in
such
a
wide
variety
of
cases
as
to
justify
a
per
se
rule.
as
this
court
noted
last
term
in
exxon
v.
state
of
maryland,
the
fact
that
one
could
reasonably
high
hypothesize
situations
in
which
competition
might
be
impeded
does
not
justify
preemption.
the
existence
of
the
antitrust
law
should
provide
sufficient
protection
against
any
significant
competitive
restrains
arising
from
contracts
of
this
type.
unfortunately,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
could
produce
results
inimical
to
the
goals
of
antitrust
policy
to
the
extent
that
it
decreases
the
available
incentives
for
innovative
effort.
it
adversely
impacts
on
the
dynamic
core
of
our
free
enterprise
system
to
the
extent
that
it
increases
risks
to
both
inventors
and
licensees.
it
is
likely
to
channel
inventions
to
the
larger
firms,
who
are
better
able
to
spread
and
absorb
those
risks.
such
a
trend
of
course
would
foster
greater
industrial
concentration
contrary
to
national
competition
policy.
i
would
like
to
address
just
one
point
on
the
patent
policy
and
its
relation
to
contracts
of
this
type.
i
believe
the
critical
core
of
respondent's
argument
is
stated
on
page
28
of
its
brief,
which
says
that
the
risk
is
that
inventors
such
as
aronson,
who
believe
their
inventions
to
be
patentable
will
have
every
incentive
to
license
their
inventions
during
the
period
the
application
is
pending
and
then
abandon
their
application
in
order
to
obtain
royalties
for
a
period
longer
than
allowed
by
the
patent
laws.
we
suggest
that
this
argument
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
kewanee,
unsound
as
a
matter
of
economic
analysis,
and
unsupported
by
empirical
evidence.
it
appears
unsound
is
a
matter
of
economic
analysis,
not
only
as
to
the
specifics
of
this
case,
but
in
the
general
run
of
cases
as
well.
here,
mrs.
aronson's
failure
to
obtain
the
patent
hardly
redounded
to
her
economic
benefit.
there
are
three
components,
which
determine
how
much
money
an
inventor
such
as
mrs.
aronson
would
make
in
a
situation
like
this.
one
is
the
royalty
rate,
which
she
will
receive
and
the
second
is
the
unit
price
of
the
goods
sold,
and
the
third
is
the
number
of
units
sold.
reduction
at
anyone
of
these
three
numbers
or
components
will
reduce
her
total
compensation.
here,
we
know
from
the
record
that
the
failure
to
obtain
a
patent
reduced
two
of
those
components,
and
economic
theory
would
indicate
that
the
third
was
also
reduced.
here,
her
royalty
rate
was
cut
in
half
and
also
the
total
sales
on
which
that
royalty
rate
was
based
would
be
decreased.
instead
of
obtaining
a
percentage
on
all
sales,
embodying
her
idea
as
would
been
the
case,
had
the
patent
been
issued,
she
only
receive
moneys
on
those
sales
made
by
quick
point
whose
share
of
the
overall
market
declined
as
new
entrants
begin
making
key
holders
reflecting
her
ideas.
additionally,
economic
theory
teaches
that
a
monopolist
is
capable
of
charging
a
higher
price
for
its
goods
and
could
be
obtained
for
them
in
a
competitive
market.
as
to
the
extent
the
disclosure
of
her
trade
secret
open
the
market
to
competition,
the
selling
price
of
quick
point's
key
chains
on
which
the
inventor's
royalty
was
based
may
have
been
reduced.
the
same
economic
analysis
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
most
inventors
are
likely
to
prefer
the
17-year
monopoly
returns
afforded
by
a
patent
system
to
the
less
certain
rewards
that
could
be
obtained
under
a
contract
law,
even
if
those
awards
might
be
spread
out
beyond
the
termination
of
a
patent.
this
certainly
was
the
conclusion
of
this
court
in
kewanee
and
we
are
unaware
of
any
empirical
information
or
body
of
academic
literature
developed
since
kewanee,
which
challenges
the
reasonableness
or
correctness
of
that
conclusion.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
i
suggest
not
your
honor.
the
brulotte
case
turned
upon
the
concept
that
the
17-year
period
is
the
absolute
limit,
which
congress
grants
in
exchange
for
the
monopoly
power,
which
it
has
granted.
brulotte
strikes
to
me
to
be
based
upon
the
same
reasoning
as
was
displayed
in
earlier
cases
by
this
court;
kellogg
v.
national
biscuit
company
and
scott
v.
marcalus,
which
state
that
upon
the
quid
pro
quo
received
by
the
public
in
return
for
the
grant
of
a
monopoly
is
that
at
the
end
of
that
17-year
period,
everybody
will
be
free
to
use
the
discovery,
free
of
any
restrictions
to
the
inventor.
here
of
course
there
was
no
patent
monopoly
granted
and
thus
the
basic
rationale
of
brulotte
does
not
bear
--
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
that's
correct.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
that
was
not
clear
from
the
record.
it
was
a
hop
picking
machine,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
court's
decision
at
least
which
would
reveal
whether
–
reveal
to
me
whether
it
would
have
been
disclosed
to
the
public
upon
sale.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
your
honor
i
believe
--
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
yeah,
i
believe
that
brulotte
stands
for
the
proposition
that
where
one
has
obtained
a
patent
then
one
may
not
obtain
any
additional
compensation
related
to
that
patent
after
the
--
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
--
the
determination
of
the
17
years.
i
think
that
is
the
limit.
that
is
the
issue
the
court
was
faced
in
brulotte
and
i
think
that
is
the
limit,
a
logical
limit
of
its
holding.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
i
believe
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
not
only
does
kewanee
support
it
and
not
only
does
the
reasoning
of
kewanee
support
it,
but
the
very
basic
preemption
theory
which
this
court
used
to
support
it,
namely
that
absent
a
frustration
of
federal
policy,
there
is
no
reason
to
preempt
state
law.
the
other
cases
in
this
general
field,
sears,
compco,
kewanee
etcetera
found
that
enforcement
of
the
particular
state
policies
or
rules
at
issue
there
would
result
in
the
frustration
of
federal
purpose
prohibited
by
the
constitution.
mr.
b.
barry
grossman
thank
you.
