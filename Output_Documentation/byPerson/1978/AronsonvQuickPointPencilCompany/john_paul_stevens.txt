justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
griswold,
could
i
ask
you
one
question
about
your
basic
theory
of
the
case?
your
opponent
say
that
your
argument
rests
entirely
insofar
as
you
claim
a
conflict
with
the
patent
law,
is
entirely
on
the
fact
that
enforcement
of
this
agreement
will
provide
a
motivation
to
a
patent
applicant
to
abandon
that
patent
application.
it's
that
the
policy
involved
here
is
one
that
causing
people
to
abandon
patent
applications
and
that
you
do
not
rely
on
the
interference
with
the
policy
to
motivate
disclosure
of
inventions
or
to
encourage
invention
itself,
but
just
rely
on
their
first
point
about
abandoning
patent
application.
is
that
a
fair
characterization
of
the
central
thrust
of
your
idea?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
central
thrust
of
your
argument
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
granting
all
this,
what
federal
policy
will
be
frustrated
by
enforcing
this
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
what
color
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
disclosure,
is
it
invention,
the
policy
favoring
invention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
respectfully
suggest
you
are
not
identifying
a
federal
policy
that
would
be
frustrated
by
enforcement
of
this
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
griswold,
i
suppose
one
could
describe
the
federal
policy
at
stake
in
brulotte
as
a
policy
against
allowing
a
patent
monopoly
to
have
any
rewards
in
addition
to
the
monopoly
itself,
can
be
enlarged
to
that
monopoly
beyond
the
terms
of
patent
grant,
that
you
can
obtain
royalties
on
unpatented
articles
sold
with
the
patent
or
on
a
period
after
the
monopoly
protection
is
expired.
i
don't
see
how
that
federal
policy
is
implicated
by
this
case
when
there
is
no
monopoly
in
the
first
place?
