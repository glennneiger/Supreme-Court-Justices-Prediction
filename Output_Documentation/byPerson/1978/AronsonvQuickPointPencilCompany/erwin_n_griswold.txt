mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
at
pages
20
and
21
of
the
record
appears
the
joint
stipulation
in
this
case
to
which
were
attached
a
number
of
these
devices
as
exhibits.
and
i
have
asked
the
clerk
to
make
them
available
to
the
court.
i
would
point
out
that
exhibits
w,
x,
y
and
z
are
key
holders
made
by
the
respondent.
the
other
exhibits
are
key
holders
made
by
competitors.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
which
ones
are
used,
but
i
identify
them
that
way
and
to
anticipate
a
question,
i
think
that
seeing
the
key
holders
is
relevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
yes
indeed
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
why
i
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
which
of
the
--
i
would
ask
the
clerk
to
make
them
available
to
the
court
if
the
court
is
willing.
it
is
relevant
because
it
is
apparent
when
you
see
it
that
there
is
no
secret
here.
i
have
one
of
them
here
and
you
that
is
it
and
you
put
your
keys
on,
and
then
you
with
a
little
force
press
it
back.
once
it
has
been
made
and
distributed,
it
is
completely
apparent
to
anyone
not
merely
a
skilled
mechanic
but
to
anyone
what
the
idea
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
don't
know.
two
similar
devices
were
patented.
i
suggest
that
first
on
the
ground
that
it
shows
that
the
kewanee
decision
is
not
applicable
to
this
case.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
trade
secret
as
that
term
was
used
in
kewanee.
i
think
it
is
also
relevant
because
there
are
arguments
here
that
these
indefinite
royalties
are
justified
because
of
the
head
start
that
quick
point
got
when
the
secret
was
disclosed
to
it.
and
that
head
start,
was
worth
a
great
deal,
which
could
be
compensated
for
by
royalties
indefinitely
in
the
future.
i
think
the
exhibits
themselves
show
that
the
head
start
here
though
probably
something
was
not
much,
neither
in
terms
of
capital
cost,
nor
in
terms
of
time.
now
at
the
outset,
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
recall
that
this
case
involves
a
relatively
narrow
issue.
there
are
amicus
briefs,
which
discuss
extensively
problems
of
technology
and
knowhow
licensing
in
billions
of
dollars
which
is
effected.
but
this
case
does
not
involve
any
aspect
of
technology
or
knowhow
licensing.
any
decision
on
that
question
should
of
course
await
a
record
and
briefs
which
deal
with
it.
and
some
of
the
briefs
and
the
government's
briefs
in
particular
talk
extensively
of
trade
secrets.
indeed
the
government's
brief
uses
the
phrase
traded
secrets
of
more
than
40
times.
but
this
is
not
a
trade
secret
case
in
the
sense
in
which
that
term
is
customarily
used
and
what
--
as
it
was
involved
before
the
court
in
the
kewanee
case.
indeed
in
the
court's
opinion
in
the
kewanee
case,
the
court
said
on
page
484,
by
definition
a
trade
secret
has
not
been
placed
in
the
public
domain,
but
this
key
holder
has
been
placed
in
the
public
domain.
it
has
been
public
since
1956,
22
years
ago.
it's
there
for
everyone
to
see
and
to
copy.
there
is
no
secret
way
of
doing
business.
no
secret
formula
or
process
in
continues
use.
no
device
which
is
used
in
the
course
of
business,
but
not
disclosed.
here
the
item
was
fully
disclosed
as
soon
as
the
key
holder
was
put
on
the
market
as
the
contract
contemplated
it
would
be.
the
distinction
seems
to
be
to
some
to
be
more
subtle
than
i
should
think
it
would
be.
i
think
i
can
illustrate
it
by
the
fact
that
i
was
counsel
for
the
petitioner
in
the
kewanee
case
and
one
of
the
first
things
i
did
was
to
come
to
the
court
and
meet
with
the
clerk
and
make
arrangements
for
the
impoundment
of
the
record
so
that
the
secrets
which
were
included
in
it
would
not
be
disclosed.
there
has
been
no
necessity
for
impounding
the
record
in
this
case.
there
was
no
secret
here.
no
need
for
reverse
engineering
which
is
talked
about
in
the
patent
cases.
since
1956,
the
secret
has
been
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
but
it
does
depend
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
relation
to
the
patent
laws
and
i
will
turn
to
that
right
now.
the
most
important
element
in
this
case
is
that
it
is
the
case
involving
a
patent
application
and
i
think
that
that
is
as
already
been
pointed
out,
but
i
would
like
to
turn
to
page
23
of
the
record
which
is
the
initial
letter,
which
was
the
item
on
page
25
embodies
the
contract.
the
second
paragraph
of
the
letter
of
june
26,
1956,
“quick
point
pencil
company
will
have
the
exclusive
right
to
make
and
sell
key
holders
of
the
type
shown
in
your
application,
serial
no.
542677
and
will
start
manufacturing
within
60
days.”
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
following
paragraph
there
is
a
further
reference
to
the
design
shown
in
your
application
serial
no.
542677
and
then
turn
to
page
24,
the
second
full
paragraph,
“in
the
event
of
any
infringement”
and
there
could
not
be
an
infringement
unless
there
was
a
patent.
but
this
was
not
something
used
by
the
president
of
the
respondent
company
alone
for
mrs.
aronson
came
back
with
an
amendment
to
the
contract
which
was
accepted
and
that
appears
on
page
25
and
that
starts
out
in
the
event
that
the
key
holder
patent
application
number
542677
is
not
allowed
within
five
years,
quick
point
pencil
company
agrees
to
pay
jane
leopoldi
as
she
then
was
two-and-one-half
percent
of
sales
at
selling
prices
as
long
as
you
continue
to
sell
same.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
they
have
as
obviously
negotiated
at
the
same
time
as
part
of
one
deal
and
i
point
out
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
one
day
apart
and
finally
accepted
on
june
27th
by
both
parties
seems
to
me
that
it
is
one
contract
and
it
is
not
as
the
government
says
several
times
in
its
brief
a
contract
to
pay
5%
if
a
patent
is
granted
and
two-and-half
percent
if
a
patent
is
not
granted.
it
is
a
contract
to
pay
5%
but
if
a
contract
is
not
granted
within
five
years
then
they
pay
two-and-half
percent,
that
is
the
event
which
actually
happened.
the
patent
application
was
abandoned
some
six
years
after
the
contract
was
made,
but
the
royalties
have
been
paid
at
the
rate
of
two-and-half
percent
after
five
years
until
1975
when
this
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
it
did
and
that
is
nothing
which
was
introduced.
that
was
also
the
same
and
the
original
letter
of
june
26,
“on
all
key
holders
which
we
make
in
accordance
with
the
design
shown
in
your
application”,
no
limited
time
was
specified
there
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
that
provision
can
stand
in
the
light
of
the
patent
laws.
i
am
glad
that
at
the
close
of
the
argument
one
of
the
relevant
cases
brulotte
against
thys
was
mentioned.
there
are
several
cases
which
are
relevant
by
a
way
of
background
here,
sears,
and
compco
to
begin
with
which
hold
in
rather
sweeping
terms
that
there
cannot
be
any
exclusive
right
with
respect
to
an
unpatented
article.
brulotte
and
thys
which
holds
that
even
if
it
is
patented
a
contract
otherwise
perfectly
valid
under
state
law
to
continue
to
pay
royalties
is
invalid
because
of
conflict
with
the
patent
laws
if
it
calls
for
royalty
payments
after
the
patent
period
has
expired.
and
then
i
would
refer
particularly
to
lear
against
adkins
which
in
many
ways
is
quite
close
to
this
case.
it
involved
a
patent
license
granted
during
the
application
period.
the
decision
of
the
court
was
thereafter
a
patent
was
granted
and
the
licensee
decided
that
the
patent
was
invalid
and
gave
notice
that
it
would
not
pay
the
royalties
covered
by
the
contract
and
counterclaimed
in
a
suit
brought
to
recover
the
royalties
that
the
patent
was
invalid
and
the
basic
decision
in
that
case
was
that
the
licensee
could
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent.
but
the
court
has
also
held
that
he
need
not
pay
royalties
from
the
time
when
he
claimed
that
the
patent
was
invalid.
that
of
course
was
in
the
teeth
of
the
provision
of
the
contract
and
our
position
here
is
that
the
petitioner
here
should
not
be
in
a
better
position
than
she
would
be
if
she'd
got
a
patent
in
which
case
her
right
to
royalties
would
have
terminated
after
17
years
or
better
position
then
if
she'd
got
a
patent
and
had
attacked
this
validity
in
which
case
her
obligation
to
pay
royalties
would
cease
if
she
got
a
decision
that
it
was
invalid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
she'd
got
the
patent
within
5
years
which
she
did
not
and
under
the
contract
she
was
entitled
to
only
two-and-half
percent
even
if
she
got
the
patent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
that
is
by
any
means
clear,
this
is
not
a
contract
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
not
and
if
you
don't
get
a
patent,
it
was
if
you
don't
get
a
patent
within
five
years
and
this
might
have
continued
for
patent
application
she
might
have
taken
that
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
or
to
the
us
district
court,
might
have
been
an
appeal
that
could
have
gone
on
for
a
long
time
and
the
contract
was
not
if
you
don't
get
a
patent,
but
if
you
don't
get
it
within
five
years.
but
i
don't
think
that's
really
relevant
for
the
reason
i'm
about
to
state
because
another
distinction
which
must
be
made
here
is
that
this
is
not
a
simple
contract
case
entirely
in
the
realm
of
state
law
a
likely
agreement
in
the
one
in
lambert
case
where
no
patent
or
patent
application
was
involved.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
know
of
no
reason
why
that
would
not
be
valid.
that
is
the
warner-lambert
case.
this
court
has
never
spoken
to
an
endless
contract.
there
are
some
emanations
in
the
common
law
to
the
effect
that
such
things
must
be
limited
to
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
that
was
true
in
brulotte
against
thys,
if
they
stop
picking
half,
they
wouldn't
have
to
pay
royalties.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
held
that
--
the
key
element
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
a
patent
application.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that's
the
central
fact
of
this
case.
the
contract
was
made
specifically
with
respect
to
it.
it
provided
for
an
exclusive
license
which
could
apply
to
the
secret,
but
obviously
applied
to
the
patent
and
the
petitioner
had
no
power
to
grant
an
exclusive
license
unless
she
got
a
patent,
anybody
else
could
make
it,
her
license
couldn't
be
exclusive.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
but
that
it
was
the
patent
application
license
is
a
basic
significance
because
this
contract
was
not
made
under
state
law
alone.
it
exercised
a
power
specifically
given
to
the
petitioner
by
the
patent
laws
and
i
call
attention
to
title
35
of
the
united
states'
code,
section
261
to
which
not
sufficient
weight
i
believe
is
given
in
our
brief
as
i
prepared
for
the
argument
i
wish
we
would
had
a
point
more
specifically
on
this,
but
that
section
provides
that
applications
for
patent
or
any
interest
there
in
shall
be
assignable
in
law
by
an
instrument
in
writing
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
the
applicant,
patentee
or
his
assigns
or
legal
representative
may
in
like
manner
grant
and
convey
an
exclusive
right
under
his
application
for
patent
or
patents
to
the
whole
or
any
specified
power
of
the
united
states
and
here
the
patent
applicant
was
exercising
that
power
granted
to
her
under
the
patent
laws.
she
was
proceeding
under
the
patent
laws.
now
there
are
many
other
provisions
to
which
i
could
make
reference.
i
find
for
example
that
the
word
applicant
or
application
appears
at
least
240
times
in
the
basic
provisions
of
the
patent
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
central
point
here
is
that
the
petitioner
operated
under
the
patent
law.
she
got
definite
advantages
from
the
patent
law,
in
that
she
got
leverage
in
making
her
contract.
no
one
would
have
made
this
contract
for
these
royalties
on
a
simple
disclosure
which
could
immediately
be
made
by
anybody
else.
that's
one
reason
i
wanted
the
exhibits
distributed
the
show
how
simple
it
was
and
how
easy
it
would
be
for
anyone
else
to
make
it.
the
reason
she
got
substantial
royalties
which
have
aggregated
up
to
1975
more
than
$200,000.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
disclosure,
disclosure
is
colorless.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
disclosure
is
colorless.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
the
capitalizing
on
the
use
of
the
patent
law
thereby
obtaining
leverage
which
produces
a
larger
royalty
than
what
otherwise
be
used
--
available
and
which
in
this
case
provided
for
a
royalty
which
i
will
call
indefinite
because
it
has
no
limit
in
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
federal
policy
is
using
the
patent
laws
to
obtain
a
monopoly
position
that
is
to
have
the
leverage
to
obtain
larger
royalties
than
what
otherwise
be
available,
royalties
which
must
eventually
be
paid
by
the
public
in
the
charges
for
the
article
and
which
continue
indefinitely
under
this
contract,
despite
the
fact
that
if
she
had
obtained
the
patent
they
would
have
been
limited
to
17
years.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
while
i
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
you
said
and
she
made
exactly
the
same
contract,
she
would
never
have
made
the
same
contract
without
having
produced
a
patent
application.
no
body
would
agree
to
pay
substantial
royalties
for
this
idea
open
to
the
public
in
the
public
domain
or
simply
for
its
disclosure.
the
only
thing
that
you
would
have
to
go
by
then
would
be
head
start
value
and
again
this
is
one
reason
why
i
asked
that
the
item
be
distributed
because
here
it's
applying
that
the
head
start
value
is
very
little.
there
is
no
great
capital
investment.
almost
any
mechanic
could
put
the
machine
together
to
make
this
item.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
i
think
that's
the
issue
in
the
case
to
some
extent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
the
contract
by
its
terms
does
not
deal
with
the
question
of
its
proper
construction
in
the
event
that
no
patent
is
ever
obtained.
i
have
tried
to
deal
with
that
in
the
last
point
of
my
brief
where
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
contract
is
with
respect
to
a
patent
application
and
it
calls
for
the
exclusive
license
to
make
and
sell
and
when
the
exclusive
license
collapsed
because
there
was
no
power,
the
petitioner
did
not
deliver
her
part
of
the
contract
when
she
didn't
get
any
power
to
deliver
an
exclusive
rescind.
i
suggest
that
there
was
a
failure
of
consideration
and
that
the
contract
should
be
construed
to
mean
that
royalties
would
not
be
payable
for
more
than
a
reasonable
time.
i
don't
think
it
is
entirely
clear
that
this
contract
made
between
layman
should
be
construed
as
a
matter
of
contract
law
requiring
indefinite
continuing
payment
of
royalties
over
an
definite
period.
now
it's
true
that
the
patent
application
gave
no
rights
to
the
applicant.
there
can
be
no
infringement
of
a
patent
application.
nevertheless
a
patent
application
has
a
substantial
in
terrorem
effect.
when
a
competitor
sees
patent
pending
on
an
item
he
is
disinclined
to
make
the
item
despite
the
fact
that
he
knows
that
it
is
not
protected
until
the
patent
is
obtained.
he
doesn't
want
to
incur
the
capital
costs
with
starting
production
of
the
item,
setting
up
his
sales
force,
printing
catalogs
and
so
on,
when
he
knows
that
he
may
soon
be
foreclosed
by
the
granting
of
a
patent.
the
licensing
of
an
application
and
the
use
of
the
patent
pending
designation
are
part
of
the
benefits
expressly
recognized
by
the
patent
law.
i
have
already
referred
to
section
291
--
261,
but
section
292
is
the
provision
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
use
patent
pending
on
an
article
unless
indeed
you
are
the
applicant
or
the
licensee
of
a
patent
application
in
which
case
you
can
use
it
and
that
undoubtedly
provides
important
leverage
in
determining
--
in
the
bargaining
process
which
determines
the
amount
of
the
royalties
under
the
contract.
the
heart
of
this
case
i
suggest
is
found
in
the
fact
that
there
was
a
patent
application
and
that
the
contract
was
made
with
respect
to
that
application.
the
petitioner
used
the
patent
laws
and
the
application
had
value
because
of
its
potentiality
under
the
patent
laws.
no
one
would
pay
a
substantial
amount
for
a
non-exclusive
license
to
make
this
article.
as
the
affidavit
of
the
petitioner
appearing
on
page
55
of
the
record
shows
the
key
holder
was
disclosed
to
several
commercial
enterprises
while
negotiations
with
the
respondent
were
pending.
if
quick
point
had
not
come
to
an
agreement
with
the
petitioner
for
an
exclusive
license,
the
petitioner
could
have
sought
to
make
an
agreement
with
one
or
the
other
commercial
enterprises.
if
an
exclusive
license
had
been
granted
to
a
competing
company,
quick
point
would
have
been
frozen
out
if
a
patent
was
granted
and
for
practical
purposes
could
not
have
made
the
article
while
the
patent
application
was
pending.
on
the
other
hand
quick
point
knew
that
if
the
petitioner
obtained
the
patent
on
the
device,
the
exclusive
license
would
assure
the
quick
point
had
the
right
to
manufacture
the
key
holder
free
from
competition
for
the
patent
period.
quick
point,
in
this
case,
bargained
not
only
for
disclosure,
but
also
for
the
future
exclusive
right
to
use
the
invention
once
a
patent
was
obtained.
in
short,
the
patent
application
which
was
an
integral
part
of
the
process
established
by
the
government
under
the
patent
laws
pursuant
to
the
patent
clause
of
the
constitution
gave
the
petitioner
bargaining
leverage
which
she
could
not
have
had
if
she
had
not
first
filed
a
patent
application.
the
mere
fact
of
the
patent
application
gave
the
petitioner,
gave
the
respondent
considerable
likelihood
of
protection
against
competitors
while
the
patent
application
was
pending
and
in
this
way
the
patent
law
was
used
as
leverage
where
the
petitioner's
benefit,
but
the
patent
laws
gave
more.
they
gave
hope
that
a
patent
would
be
obtained
and
in
that
event
the
contract
gave
quick
point
the
exclusive
right
to
make
and
sell
the
item.
this
was
a
prospect
made
possible
by
the
patent
laws
and
it
was
fully
utilized
by
the
petitioner
here.
the
petitioner
entered
into
the
patent
process
and
she
obtained
a
substantial
benefit
because
she
invoked
the
patent
laws.
without
the
patent
applications
she
would
have
been
in
a
no
position
at
all
to
obtain
substantial
royalties
for
this
time,
which
was
--
for
this
item,
which
was
incapable
of
exploitation
without
full
disclosure.
she
used
the
patent
laws
successfully
even
though
she
did
not
obtain
a
patent
and
her
contract
should
be
qualified
by
law
in
accordance
with
the
principles
which
had
been
developed
in
several
patent
cases.
it
is
important
again
to
recall
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
continuing
trade
secret
as
in
kewanee.
there
was
a
secret
here,
but
it
was
inherently
time
limited.
once
the
article
was
made
and
marketed,
the
secret
was
fully
disclosed.
and
thus
as
far
as
the
objective
of
disclosure
under
the
patent
system
is
concerned
a
decision
in
favor
of
quick
point
will
have
no
adverse
effect.
the
holder
of
an
idea
for
a
secret
device
like
this
can
keep
it
to
himself
if
he
wishes
to
do
so,
but
if
he
wants
to
realize
it
on
it
he
must
disclose
it,
there
is
no
alternative.
he
can
of
course
apply
for
a
patent
without
licensing
the
device
in
which
case
there
will
be
no
disclosure
until
a
patent
is
issued
and
he
will
have
no
return
from
the
idea
while
the
patent
is
pending.
on
the
other
hand
he
can
license
the
idea
with
or
without
applying
for
a
patent.
if
he
licenses
the
idea
without
applying
for
a
patent,
he
can
only
hope
to
obtain
head
start
value
from
the
licensee.
and
i
suggest
in
this
case
that
would
be
very
small
since
the
idea
will
be
fully
disclosed
as
soon
as
the
licensee
puts
the
item
on
the
market.
the
only
way
that
the
inventor
can
hope
to
get
more
is
to
apply
for
a
patent,
thus
utilizing
the
patent
laws
and
then
seek
to
license
the
patent
application
in
the
hope
for
a
patent.
that
is
what
was
done
here.
the
petitioner
chose
to
proceed
under
the
patent
system
and
she
got
great
leverage
from
the
patent
system.
who
would
have
paid
very
much
for
this
idea
on
a
non-exclusive
basis
which
would
have
been
the
situation
if
no
patent
had
been
applied
for.
now
turning
again
to
kewanee,
i
point
out
that
it
did
not
involve
a
license
situation.
there
was
no
question
about
the
validity
of
a
license
or
about
the
validity
of
a
license
extending
for
an
indefinite
period.
what
it
involved
was
a
classic
trade
secret,
breach
of
employment
contract
situation
in
which
the
court
was
asked
to
strike
down
a
longstanding
body
of
state
trade
secret
law
which
served
important
public
policy
objectives.
this
the
court
was
understandably
reluctant
to
do.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
important
public
policies
objectives
of
the
state
yes
mr.
justice
involving
the
sanctity
of
fiduciary
relations
between
employers
and
employees
within
the
state.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
this
court
would
have
to
decide
and
my
suggestion
would
be
that
whatever
the
public
policy
conceptions
objectives
may
be,
they
are
not
nearly
as
important.
the
sole
issue
here
is
whether
it
is
valid
to
make
a
contract
with
respect
to
a
pending
patent
application
which
calls
for
indefinite
royalties
extending
beyond
the
period
when
royalties
would
be
payable
if
a
patent
was
allowed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
to
that
extent
and
that
step
has
long
since
been
taken
perhaps
the
clearest
and
most
striking
case
being
brulotte
against
thys
where
the
court
held
at
no
matter
what
the
state
contract
law
was,
a
contract
calling
for
the
payment
of
royalties
after
a
patent
had
expired
was
invalid.
and
i
am
contending
here
that
a
contract
calling
for
the
payment
of
royalties
without
limit
of
time
made
with
respect
to
a
specific
pending
patent
application
should
likewise
not
be
construed
to
call
for
the
payment
of
royalties
for
an
indefinite
period
because
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
scope,
effect,
objective
of
the
patent
laws
and
i
think
here
is
perhaps
a
better
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question.
there
is
here
the
same
interference
with
the
patent
law
that
there
was
in
brulotte
against
thys.
here,
there
is
a
disclosure,
there
is
an
obtaining
of
royalties
with
respect
to
the
disclosure.
there
is
if
this
contract
is
invalid
a
perpetual
handicapping
of
this
competitor
in
the
market
with
inevitable
increase
in
the
overall
price
that
the
public
must
pay
for
the
item
and
as
in
brulotte
and
thys
the
contract
was
held
to
be
invalid
after
the
patent
period
expired.
i
don't
know
just
when
the
contract
becomes
invalid
here.
i
think
that
a
very
good
peace
can
be
made
for
the
proposition
that
royalties
will
not
do
under
this
contract
after
the
patent
application
was
abandoned.
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
payment
of
royalties
during
the
patent
application
period.
there
isn't
much
question
with
respect
to
payment
for
a
number
of
years,
there
isn't
any
question
with
respect
to
the
payment
of
royalties
for
14
years
after
the
patent
application
was
abandoned
because
those
royalties
were
paid
and
this
suit
is
not
an
effort
to
get
them
back.
this
suit
is
a
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment
seeking
a
declaration
that
under
proper
application
of
the
scope
of
the
patent
laws
any
provision
in
state
law
which
calls
for
the
payment
of
royalties
for
an
indefinite
period
under
a
contract
made
specifically
with
respect
to
a
patent
application
is
invalid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
the
answer
is
that
here
there
was
a
preliminary
or
in
court
patent
monopoly.
there
was
the
hope
and
expectation
that
a
patent
monopoly
would
be
obtained
and
there
was
a
contract
made
with
respect
to
that
hope
and
expectation
which
provided
for
larger
royalties
undoubtedly
then
would
have
been
available
if
no
patent
application
had
been
filed.
and
so
the
patent
laws
have
been
used
to
obtain
a
larger
tribute
from
the
public
to
use
it
in
that
sense
than
would
have
been
obtained
if
the
patent
laws
had
not
been
invoked
and
that
i
suggest
is
essentially
the
consideration
which
was
behind
this
court's
decision
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
essentially
the
ground
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
the
thys
case,
not
startup
value
but
lump
sum
payment
for
the
machine
and
i
can
imagine
a
contract
calling
for
royalty
payments
after
the
17-year
period.
for
example
suppose
the
contract
provided
that
the
royalties
shall
be
so
much
for
17
years,
but
only
half
of
them
shall
be
paid
in
each
year
and
the
second
half
shall
be
paid
in
the
17
years
following
the
expiration
of
the
patent
i
would
assume
that
would
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice
if
she
got
a
patent
she
couldn't
get
royalties
for
more
than
17
years,
no
matter
what
the
contract
said.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
she
had
been
a
-
-
if
quick
point
had
been
a
patent
licensee
and
a
patent
had
been
obtained,
quick
point
could
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent
and
from
the
time
it
attacked
the
validity
of
the
patent
it
would
not
have
to
pay
royalties
no
matter
what
the
contract
said.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
lear
case?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
or
not,
that's
hard
to
--
after
all
the
contract
that
was
made
in
1956
was
one
which
called
for
an
aggregate
of
$200,000
royalty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
see
how
that
is
applicable
here,
but
particularly
with
respect
to
the
lear
case
where
it
was
held
that
if
the
licensee
attacks
the
patent
and
is
successful,
no
loyalties
are
due
from
the
time
when
he
states
that
he
will
attack
the
patent
and
we
find
it
difficult
to
think
that
the
licensor
of
a
patent
application
should
stand
in
a
better
position
than
a
person
who
has
a
good
enough
invention
so
that
he
gets
a
patent
or
even
one
like
lear
who
has
a
good
enough
invention
so
that
he
gets
a
patent
but
it
is
latter
held
to
be
invalid.
there
is
one
point
to
which
i
would
like
to
make
reference.
twice
while
this
was
going
on
quick
point
asserted
its,
through
one
means
or
another,
its
obligation
to
pay
royalties.
that
of
course
did
not
necessarily
mean
indefinitely
but
to
continue
to
pay
royalties.
i
would
point
out
that
one
of
those
letter
was
by
its
patent
counsel
and
it
may
well
have
been
simply
erroneous.
it
was
written
before
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
sears
and
compco,
and
brulotte
and
thys
and
the
lear
case
and
this
court
has
been
a
great
teacher
in
this
area
over
the
past
15
years.
and
finally
quick
point
may
well
have
thought
it
equitable
or
generous
to
continue
making
such
payments
because
for
sometime
it
was
the
only
one
marketing
the
key
holder.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes
mr.
justice
of
course
and
kewanee
is
an
excellent
case
that
i
am
very
much
pleased
with.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
it
has
no
relation
to
this
case
because
this
case
did
does
not
involve
a
trade
secret
of
the
sort
which
caused
the
concern
of
the
court
in
the
kewanee
case
and
the
kewanee
case
did
not
involve
a
licensing
situation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
that's
what
i
thought
i
was
commenting
on
that
in
the
first
place
he
may
well
have
been
wrong.
he
was
not
an
officer
of
the
company.
he
was
a
patent
counsel.
in
the
second
place
it
was
written
before
sears
and
compco
and
thys
and
lear
as
to
which
the
court
i
suggest
has
been
a
great
teacher.
the
things
have
developed,
he
may
well
have
thought
that
was
the
law
when
he
did
it,
but
i
suggest
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
had
shown
that
is
no
longer
the
law
and
finally
quick
point
may
simply
have
wanted
to
be
generous.
they
had
had
good
relations
with
this
lady
and
until
the
1960s,
they
did
not
have
any
competition
as
a
practical
matter.
it
was
only
when
beginning
in
the
late
1960s,
they
found
themselves
at
a
heavy
competitive
disadvantage.
you
may
say
only
2.5%
royalty
but
that
maybe
half
the
profit.
it
was
only
then
that
they
began
to
explore
the
situation
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
pointed
clearly
in
the
direction
that
a
license
made
with
respect
to
a
patent
application
should
not
give
greater
rights
than
would
have
been
obtained
if
a
patent
had
actually
been
granted.
