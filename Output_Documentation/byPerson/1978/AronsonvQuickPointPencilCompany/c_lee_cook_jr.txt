mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
jane
aronson,
in
1955
made
an
invention.
that
invention
was
the
design
of
a
particular
kind
of
key
ring
or
key
holder.
now,
the
particular
design
of
that
key
holder
is
not
really
material
to
this
case,
but
i
think
i
should
note
that
it
is
different
from
the
design
shown
in
the
english
patent
which
is
attached
to
the
brief
of
the
amicus
ercon
and
it
is
different
from
the
design
shown
in
the
(inaudible)
patent
which
is
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
there
is
not
as
such
in
the
printed
record.
what
attached
to
the
record
which
came
to
the
court
we
believe
is
an
actual
sample
of
that
key
ring.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
it
is
not
your
honor
except
that
the
only
reason
i
mentioned
the
particular
--
that
it
is
different
from
the
design
shown
in
those
patents
is
the
argument
of
the
amicus
ercon,
that
it
was
in
the
public
domain
or
known
before
the
invention
by
the
petitioner.
the
closest
thing
that
describes
it
is
the
catalog
of
the
respondent
quick
point,
which
is
in
the
printed
record,
but
you
cannot
see
the
inside
of
the
key
ring.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
having
made
this
invention
and
having
prepared
and
filed
a
patent
application
which
disclosed
and
described
the
invention,
she
took
it
to
a
number
of
potential
manufacturers.
one
of
those
manufacturers
was
the
respondent
quick
point
pencil
company
in
st.
louis.
the
then
president
of
quick
point
was
very
interested
in
manufacturing
this
article
and
he
proposed
a
license
agreement
which
called
for
a
5%
royalty
on
the
sales
of
the
article
by
quick
point.
at
the
request
of
petitioner,
an
addendum
was
prepared
to
this
license
agreement.
that
addendum
provided
that
if
no
patent
were
issued
within
a
five
years,
the
royalty
rate
would
be
reduced
to
2.5%,
but
that
royalty
would
continue
as
long
as
quick
point
made
the
article.
now
no
patent
was
ever
obtained
and
at
the
end
of
the
five-year
period,
the
royalty
was
reduced
to
2.5%.
quick
point
paid
those
royalties
for
many
years
after
it
was
known
that
no
patent
was
obtained
and
after
repeatedly
reaffirmed
its
obligation
to
do
so.
now
although
the
article
was
secret
at
the
time
it
was
first
disclosed
to
quick
point
and
it
was
disclosed
at
quick
point
and
the
others
under
an
obligation
of
confidence,
it
is
the
nature
of
the
invention
is
such
that
once
it
was
put
on
commercial
sale,
it
was
revealed
to
the
public
and
could
be
copied
by
others.
and
indeed
by
the
late
1960's,
a
number
of
other
companies
were
making
devices
substantially
identical
to
quick
point's.
now
in
1975,
quick
point
stopped
paying
royalties
and
brought
this
suit
for
declaratory
judgment.
it
contended
in
the
suit
that
the
agreement
was
illegal
and
unenforceable.
it
did
not
contend
as
respondent's
brief
in
this
court
contends
that
the
intention
of
the
parties
was
that
no
royalties
would
be
due
if
no
patent
were
obtained.
on
the
contrary,
it
contended
the
opposite
that
is
that
the
agreement
bound
quick
point
to
pay
royalties
even
if
no
patent
were
obtained
and
that
made
the
agreement
illegal.
on
a
stipulated
record
and
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
found
that
the
agreement
was
clear
and
unambiguous,
that
it
was
valid
and
enforceable
under
the
state
law
and
that
there
was
no
reason
in
the
federal
patent
policy
or
the
federal
antitrust
policy
for
the
federal
courts
to
interfere
with
its
enforcement.
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
two-to-one
decision,
reversed.
it
held
that
the
principles
involved
in
the
federal
patent
law
precluded
quick
point
from
being
bound
by
its
agreement,
because
no
patent
was
issued
and
the
article
had
become
publicly
known.
it
was
no
longer
a
secret.
district
judge
larson
sitting
by
designation
decided
saying
that
in
his
view,
the
matter
should
be
controlled
by
state
contract
law
and
that
there
was
no
reason
for
the
federal
courts
to
preempt
and
refuse
to
enforce
the
state
law.
thus
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
does
the
federal
patent
law
preempt
the
state
law
and
prevent
enforcement
of
a
contract
calling
for
continuing
royalties
on
a
previously
secret
article
simply
because
no
patent
was
issued
and
the
article
is
no
longer
a
secret.
now
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
constitutes
an
unnecessary
interference
by
the
federal
courts
with
the
normal
application
of
state
contract
law.
that
interference
was
not
required
by
nor
even
consistent
with
the
federal
patent
law.
i
intend
to
deal
primarily
with
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
the
federal
patent
law.
we
believe
also
that
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
about
enforcing
this
agreement
with
the
federal
antitrust
laws
or
the
policy
of
free
and
open
competition.
that
subject
matter
is
however
covered
very
thoroughly
in
the
briefs,
particularly
the
brief
of
the
united
states
amicus
and
i
believe
that
mr.
grossman
who
will
speak
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
will
also
touch
on
that
issue.
specifically
i
want
to
deal
with
three
points.
first,
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
in
kewanee
oil
versus
bicron.
secondly;
that
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
apply
that
test,
and
thirdly,
if
that
test
is
applied
to
the
state
contract
law
involved
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
objectives
of
the
federal
patent
law
are
not
interfered
with
and
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
federal
patent
law
and
the
state
contract
law
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
yes,
it
really
is
and
i
don't
think
that
there
can
be
any
doubt
that
it
is
governed
by
kewanee.
the
court
will
recall
in
that
case,
that
it
sustained
the
validity
of
state
trade
secret
law,
which
permitted
an
owner
of
a
trade
secret
to
sue
former
employees
for
misappropriating
those
trade
secrets.
in
that
case,
the
court
reaffirmed
its
prior
holding
that
the
patent
law
is
not
exclusive
and
that
the
state
law
should
be
enforced
unless
it
conflicts
with
the
patent
law
or
the
federal
law,
and
the
way
to
determine
whether
a
state
law
conflicts
with
a
federal
law,
the
court
said,
was
to
look
at
whether
it
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
objectives
of
the
federal
law.
now
the
objective
of
the
federal
patent
law
as
set
forth
in
the
constitution
is
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
the
useful
arts;
in
other
words,
to
encourage
invention.
the
patent
law
encourages
invention
in
two
ways.
first,
it
offers
the
inventor
a
patent,
which
for
a
limited
period
of
time
permits
that
inventor
to
exclude
others
from
making,
using
or
selling
his
invention.
secondly,
in
return
for
that
extraordinary
grant,
it
requires
the
inventor
to
disclose
fully
his
invention
to
the
public
in
the
patent.
and
that
way,
not
only
is
the
public
free
to
use
it
after
the
expiration
of
the
patent,
but
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
body
of
knowledge
and
that
itself
should
contribute
to
and
stimulate
further
inventions
or
other
advances
in
the
art.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
in
my
view
mr.
chief
justice,
the
case
would
be
no
different,
because
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
took
nothing
from
the
public.
she
never
got
a
patent
and
whether
it
was
revealed
in
a
patent
or
contained
in
a
patent
application
is
really
irrelevant.
the
point
is
she
revealed
an
idea,
she
made
a
contract
and
there
is
no
reason
for
this
respondent
to
get
out
of
its
obligation
to
pay
the
royalties
under
that
contract.
the
test
thus
therefore
under
kewanee
is
whether
enforcing
this
agreement
will
discourage
invention
or
prevent
the
disclosure
of
inventions
to
the
public.
the
court
of
appeals
nowhere
applied
this
test.
it
did
not
even
consider
it
as
far
as
we
can
tell
from
the
opinion.
there
is
no
discussion
of
the
analysis
or
the
test
in
kewanee
at
all.
although
it
made
reference
to
kewanee,
it
did
not
discuss
its
test.
when
that
test
is
applied
here
however,
it
is
clear
that
enforcing
this
agreement
will
not
create
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
objectives
of
the
patent
law,
but
will
instead
further
those
objectives.
it
will
certainly
not
discourage
invention.
on
the
other
hand,
it
will
encourage
invention
to
enforce
agreement
such
as
this
because
inventors
if
they
know
that
they
can
enter
into
agreement
such
as
this
will
be
willing
to
expand
the
time
effort
and
money
without
concern
as
to
whether
their
invention
is
patentable
or
not
or
without
concern
as
to
whether
their
invention
is
one
which
can
be
kept
secret.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
kewanee,
often
an
important
invention
may
not
be
patentable,
but
it
is
nevertheless
an
important
invention.
under
the
law
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
inventor
made
a
valuable
invention
and
the
manufacturer
was
willing
to
pay
for
it,
the
inventor
could
have
the
expectation
of
entering
into
an
enforceable
agreement
which
would
provide
him
a
reward
for
his
invention
and
he
would
therefore
be
encouraged
to
invent.
failure
to
enforce
this
agreement
on
the
other
hand
will
discourage
invention,
because
the
inventor
who
cannot
obtain
a
patent
will
be
faced
with
two
alternatives.
he
can
go
into
the
manufacture
of
the
article
himself
which
this
court
noted
in
kewanee
may
not
be
the
best
allocation
of
our
economic
resources
or
he
can
attempt
to
sell
it
for
a
single
lump
sum
payment
before
it
becomes
a
big
secret,
get
all
of
his
money
immediately.
but
that
is
often
difficult
too,
because
licensees
are
reluctant
to
make
substantial
payments
until
they
know
what
the
commercial
success
of
the
invention
would
be.
not
only
will
enforcement
of
this
agreement
encourage
invention,
it
will
cause
those
inventions
to
be
made
available
and
known
to
the
public
sooner
rather
than
later.
rather
than
waiting
to
see
if
he
can
obtain
a
patent
under
agreements
of
this
type,
the
inventor
puts
his
article
or
his
invention
out
to
the
public
immediately;
not
only
into
the
commercial
channels
where
it
may
benefit
the
economy
but
also
to
the
public
so
that
they
can
copy
it
or
be
stimulated
to
make
further
and
additional
inventions.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
and
that
is
really
the
truly
anomalous
thing
about
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
because
if
this
invention
had
been
one
which
could
be
kept
secret
and
was
not
revealed
upon
its
sale
to
the
public,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondent
would
say
the
agreement
is
enforceable,
and
yet
the
objectives
of
the
patent
law
are
furthered
much
better
by
an
agreement
where
the
invention
becomes
public
and
available
to
the
public
than
they
are
in
a
situation
where
the
invention
by
its
nature
remain
secret.
yet
in
this
court,
in
kewanee
specifically
approved,
not
only
enforcing
implied
agreements
against
employees,
but
contracts
for
inventions
where
the
subject
matter
of
the
invention
remained
secret.
now
really
nowhere
in
respondent's
brief,
does
respondent
ever
contend
that
enforcement
of
this
agreement
will
discourage
invention
or
discourage
the
disclosure
of
invention.
and
that
is
because
it
is
impossible
to
make
that
contention
on
these
facts.
under
kewanee,
if
the
enforcement
of
the
state
law
will
not
interfere
with
the
accomplishment
of
the
patent
law
objectives
of
encouraging
invention
and
encouraging
disclosure
to
the
public
of
inventions
which
is
the
case
here,
there
is
no
need;
there
is
no
reason
for
the
federal
courts
to
interfere
with
the
normal
application
of
state
law.
now
instead
of
dealing
with
this
point,
the
respondent
argues
that
the
difficulty
here
is
that
enforcing
agreements
of
this
type
will
cause
inventors
who
apply
for
a
patent
to
abandon
those
patent
applications.
the
argument
goes
that
an
inventor
will
apply
for
a
patent,
get
an
agreement
such
as
this,
and
then
abandon
the
application.
that
argument
we
believe
is
unsound
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
is
factually
unsound.
as
this
court
noted
in
kewanee,
the
benefits
of
a
patent
are
such
that
it
is
very
unlikely
that
anyone
who
really
has
a
patentable
invention
will
abandon
that
patent
application.
secondly,
it
is
particularly
true
where
as
in
this
case,
the
commercial
use
of
the
invention
discloses
it
to
the
public.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
famous
coca
cola
formula
which
mr.
justice
marshall
referred
to
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
kewanee.
we
are
talking
about
an
invention
that
when
it
is
sold,
it
is
publicly
known.
under
those
circumstances,
the
chance
is
that
a
patent
applicant
will
in
bad
faith
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
his
licensee,
somehow
abandon
a
patent
application
on
a
valid
patentable
invention
are
remote
indeed.
moreover,
this
problem
if
indeed
it
is
a
problem,
is
one
which
easily
can
be
solved
by
draftsmanship.
the
contract
can
say
the
patentee
or
the
licenser
will
diligently
pursue
the
application.
and
then
if
he
does
not
do
so,
he
has
breached
the
agreement,
or
it
can
say
that
the
licensee
may
have
the
right
to
prosecute
the
patent
application;
a
provision
that
is
quite
common
and
frequent
in
patent
license
agreement,
or
it
can
provide
that
if
no
patent
is
obtained,
the
royalties
will
cease
or
they
will
cease
after
a
given
number
of
years
or
they
will
cease
after
the
production
of
a
given
number
of
units
or
the
payment
of
a
given
amount
of
royalty.
all
of
those
are
ways
of
overcoming
this
problem
if
indeed
it
is
a
problem.
but
let
us
assume
for
the
moment,
for
purposes
of
argument,
that
there
would
be
some
incentive
by
a
patent
applicant
who
has
a
license
agreement
such
as
this
to
abandon
the
application.
that
does
not
mean
that
enforcing
this
agreement
will
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
patent
laws.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
kewanee,
some
diversion
from
the
patent
system
is
permissible
and
the
diversion
in
the
patent
from
the
patent
system
or
the
potential
diversion
from
the
patent
system
in
kewanee
is
much
greater
than
the
potential
diversion
here,
because
in
kewanee,
it
contemplated
an
invention
which
remained
secret.
there
at
least
the
owner
of
the
invention
has
an
option.
he
can
say,
i
will
get
the
patent,
but
if
i
get
that,
it
becomes
public
or
i
can
keep
it
secret
and
try
to
protect
my
rights
by
keeping
it
secret.
here
the
inventor
has
no
such
choice
because
once
he
puts
his
article
on
sale,
it
becomes
public
and
he
cannot
keep
it
secret.
the
diversion
from
the
patent
system,
if
indeed
there
is
any,
is
much
less
in
this
case
than
in
the
facts
presented
in
kewanee.
as
i
mentioned
before
in
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice's
question,
the
fact
is
that
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
here
would
have
enforced
this
agreement
if
the
subject
matter
of
the
agreement
had
not
been
the
article
which
became
public
upon
its
sale,
but
for
example
the
process
by
which
it
is
made.
even
though
a
patent
application
had
been
applied
for
and
abandoned
under
the
rationale
of
the
decision
below,
that
agreement
would
be
enforceable.
yet
merely
because
the
invention
here
was
one
which
became
public
upon
its
sale,
the
court
of
appeal
says,
it
is
not
enforceable.
yet
i
submit
to
you
that
the
circumstances
here
are
less
inconsistent
and
indeed
more,
they
are
in
fact
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
the
patent
law,
much
more
so
than
in
the
case
where
the
invention
can
be
kept
secret.
finally
this
argument
of
respondent
we
believe
deals
not
with
the
objectives
of
the
patent
law,
but
with
the
means
by
which
the
patent
chooses
to
accomplish
those
objectives.
the
important
thing
here
is
not
whether
somebody
gets
a
patent,
the
important
thing
is
that
they
make
inventions
and
that
they
disclose
those
inventions
to
the
public.
the
fact
that
the
state
law
will
encourage
invention
and
encourage
the
disclosure
does
not
make
it
inconsistent
with
the
federal
patent
law.
indeed
as
this
court
noted
in
kewanee,
certainly
the
patent
policy
of
encouraging
invention
is
not
disturbed
by
the
existence
of
another
form
of
incentive
to
invent.
the
state
contract
law
involved
in
this
case
and
the
federal
patent
law
are
not
in
conflict;
they
are
in
harmony.
both
can
stand
together;
one
complimenting
the
other
to
encourage
research
and
innovation
which
is
vital
to
our
economy
and
to
the
continued
growth
of
our
nation,
probably
more
so
today
than
in
any
time
in
our
history.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
thwarts
that
encouragement
of
invention,
and
unnecessarily
strikes
down
the
state
law;
it
should
be
reversed.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
yes
just
briefly,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
deal
specifically
with
this
letter,
which
referred
to
by
dean
griswold
just
at
the
end
of
his
argument.
because
that
letter
i
think
also
not
only
deals
with
the
question
of
what
was
the
intention
of
the
party
but
answers
also
the
argument
about
the
fact
that
the
policy
really
that's
its
involved
here
in
terms
of
whether
some
federal
policy
is
afforded
by
the
existence
of
the
patent
application.
that
--
the
argument
of
respondent
on
that
point
ignores
i
believe
the
fact
that
the
parties
did
specifically
contemplate
that
no
patent
would
issue
and
that
in
that
event
the
royalty
would
be
reduced
to
2.5%.
he
also
argues
that
why
would
anyone
sign
such
agreement
or
why
would
anyone
enter
into
the
agreement
such
as
this,
if
he
could
not
get
exclusivity.
this
letter,
which
is
on
page
39
of
the
record,
i
believe
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
parties
contemplated
that
they
might
not
get
exclusivity.
indeed
it
says
that
we
remind
you
that
under
the
license
agreement,
--
the
agreement
is
in
respect
of
the
disclosure
and
not
the
claims.
it
is
the
claims,
which
give
the
exclusivity
and
he
is
saying
here
that
even
if
we
get
a
patent,
we
may
not
have
exclusivity
with
respect
to
what
we
are
obligated
to
pay
your
royalties
on.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
yes.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
in
my
opinion,
it
would
not
under
this
court's
decision
in
brulotte
because
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
yes,
because
those
circumstances
the
patent
owner
has
taken
something
from
the
public.
it
has
taken
that
extraordinary
grant
of
the
right
to
exclude
the
entire
public
from
making,
using,
or
selling
this
device.
and
in
brulotte
if
the
court
would
recall,
the
court's
–
the
opinion
specifically
said
that
the
rationale
here
does
not
apply
to
contracts
involving
unpatented
machines.
the
rationale
of
brulotte
was
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out
if
you
give
an
inventor
a
monopoly
by
a
patent,
you
cannot
permit
him
to
expand
that
monopoly
whether
to
non-patented
articles
or
beyond
the
17
years.
but
in
this
case,
aronson
has
taken
nothing
from
the
public.
the
existence
of
the
patent
application
gives
her
nothing
against
the
public.
it
gives
her
no
right
to
exclude
others
and
there
is
no
public
policy
that
wasn't
--
certainly
not
the
policy
that
was
involved
in
brulotte
has
no
application
here.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
well,
we
not
--
the
record
doesn't
show
for
sure
that
anybody
did
put
patent
pending
or
anything
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
but
they
could
have,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
but
also
they
could
have
you
see
the
argument
i
believe
the
respondent
really
deserts
the
court
of
appeals
because
what
the
court
of
appeal
said
is
that
the
important
thing
here
is
that
that
invention
wasn't
secret.
it
was
somehow
in
the
public
domain,
but
if
we
had
had
a
patent
application
on
an
invention,
which
was
secret,
and
then
abandon
the
patent
application,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
enforced
that
agreement
and
yet
the
very
same
in
terrorem
effect,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
would
be
present
and
indeed
in
kewanee
there
was
no
question
--
the
decision
was
not
that
you
can
enforce
the
trade
secret
if
you
haven't
applied
for
a
patent
on
it.
the
decision
was
that
you
can
enforce
your
rights
in
the
trade
secret.
now
that
leaves
-
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
parties
hoped
there
would
be
a
patent.
and
if
there
was
a
patent
-
-
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
exactly
and
i
believe
your
honor
that
if
the
parties
hoped
there
would
be
a
patent
and
if
there
would
had
been
a
patent,
quick
point
would
have
been
willing
to
pay
5%
royalty.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
i
do
because
i
think
the
reduction
in
the
royalty
in
this
case
shows
that
the
party
specifically
contemplated
that
the
possibilities
[voice
overlap]
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
agree
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
yes,
i
will.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
you
see
that
would
depend
upon
the
intention
of
the
party.
and
i
think
the
intention
of
the
parties
has
made
very
clear
here.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
exactly
and
if
--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
does
but
i
think
in
this
particular
case
the
fact
is
they
agreed
on
it
because
they
contemplated
that
a
patent
might
not
issue
and
quick
point
was
willing
to
pay
the
2.5%
for
what
dean
griswold
has
referred
to
as
the
head
start
value.
now
we
do
know
that
their
head
start
value
was
very
substantial
here.
they
didn't
get
competitors
in
this
business
until
the
late
1960s,
even
though
the
patent
application
was
long
out
of
existence.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
there
is
a
head
start
value,
there
is
no
federal
interest
in
having
the
court's
interfere
with
deciding
what
that
value
is?
if
the
parties
in
an
arm's-length
negotiations
agreed
that
value
was
2.5%,
why
should
the
courts
interfere
with
that?
why
shouldn't
the
courts
permit
the
state
law
to
enforce
that
agreement?
now,
if
i
could
touch
just
briefly
on
the
question
of
a
trade
secret.
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
this
invention
was
first
disclosed
to
quick
point,
it
was
a
trade
secret.
that's
--
it
was
--
the
fact
that
it
was
secret
is
conceded
in
respondent's
brief,
it
was
stipulated
to
in
this
record.
the
fact
that
it
was
a
value
is
conceded
in
respondent's
brief
because
they
can
see
that
we
are
entitled
to
substantial
payments
for
that
disclosure.
the
fact
that
it
later
became
public
by
reason
of
the
sale,
does
not
mean
that
when
the
contract
was
entered
into
it
was
a
secret.
but
even
if
it
were
not
a
trade
secret
within
the
technical
definition
on
trade
secrets,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
because
the
principle
involved
here
should
apply
whether
it's
an
abstract
idea,
the
concept
for
a
television
program,
an
advertising
theme
or
anything
that
may
not
be
a
trade
secret
or
a
patentable
invention.
the
issue
involved
here
is
what
is
the
federal
policy
which
is
supported
by
permitting
the
states
to
enforce
bargains
entered
into
between
parties
by
which
one
agrees
to
share
with
the
other
the
profits
he
may
make
from
the
other's
invention
or
idea
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
and
if
the
court's
interfere
with
the
enforcement
of
agreements
like
this,
we
will
be
taking
away
from
potential
inventors,
particularly
small
inventors,
the
strong
incentive
to
make
inventions.
otherwise
they
will
be
forced
to
either
get
a
patent
or
they
can't
get
a
patent,
they
will
have
to
try
to
sell
it
for
a
lump
sum,
which
is
a
hobson's
choice.
we
respectfully
urge
you
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
