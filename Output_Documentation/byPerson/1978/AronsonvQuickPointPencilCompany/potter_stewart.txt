justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
picture
of
it
or
a
representation
of
it
anywhere
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
really
just
one
point,
isn't
it
that
this
case
is
governed
by
kewanee?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
brulotte
case?
does
that
bear
on
this?
justice
potter
stewart
since
everybody
could
use
it
from
the
word
go?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
item
involved
in
brulotte,
i
have
forgotten?
was
it
something
that
was
necessarily
disclosed
to
the
public?
justice
potter
stewart
broadly
read
the
brulotte
case,
i
should
suppose
does
bear
on
this,
doesn't
it?
i
mean
says
that,
even
though
it
has
been
disclosed
to
the
public,
both
because
it
was
patented
and
presumably
because
it
was
sold
publicly,
you
can't
receive
any
license
payments
for
a
non-patented
article.
justice
potter
stewart
without
violating
because
the
patent
preempts
it?
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
17
years.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
mr.
griswold,
in
order
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
the
scope
in
entire
thrust
of
your
argument.
what
if
in
this
case
there
been
no
reference
whatsoever
to
any
patent
application
nor
to
whether
or
not
a
patent
would
be
[inaudible]
but
simply
the
fact
show
the
disclosure
by
present
mrs.
aronson,
to
quick
point
of
this
keyring
and
a
simple
agreement
that
we'll
pay
you
two-and-half
percent
of
the
sales
price
for
this
keyring
for
every
keyring
we
sell
from
now
on
with
no
reference
to
any
patent
law
and
that
this
had
been
written
down
in
a
contract
that
was
valid
under
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
no
it's
endless
only
insofar
as
it's
not
in
perpetuity,
it's
every
time
i
sell
these
keyrings
they
pay
mrs.
aronson
two-and-half
percent.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
my
question
you
think
that
sort
of
a
contract
would
not
at
all
be
preempted
by
federal
patent
law?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
critical?
justice
potter
stewart
well
according
to
how
you
define
the
word
exclusive,
one
could
easily
read
that
as
meaning
i
won't
license
to
anybody
else?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cook
what
if
a
patent
had
issued?
first
of
all,
there
would
have
been
a
continuing
obligation
to
pay
5%,
not
2.5%.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
17
years
had
expired
after
the
issuance
of
the
patent,
what
the
obligation
have
continued?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
pretty
clear,
isn't
it
under
brulotte?
justice
potter
stewart
they
could
have?
