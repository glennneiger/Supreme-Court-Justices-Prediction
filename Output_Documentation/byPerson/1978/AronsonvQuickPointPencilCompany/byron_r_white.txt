justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
party,
the
parties
also
contracted
with
respect
to
a
payment
absolute
patent.
they
said
if
no
patent
is
obtained
the
royalties
will
go
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
and
would
the
case
be
different
if
they
had
said
in
“and
this
is
our
valuation
of
the
startup
value
of
this
disclosure?”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
can
you
say
that
they
are
using
that
the
patent
monopoly
or
the
in-court
patent
monopoly
is
lending
some
leverage
here
when
they
expressly
contract
for
what
the
royalties
should
be
if
there
is
no
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
you
are
supposed
that
royalty
rate
was
higher
in
this
contract
up
until
than
it
was
after
the
patent
was
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
paying
for
the
right
to
use
a
mechanism
that
on
which
a
patent
application
was
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
different
to
see
if
there
had
been
no
provision
for
a
reduction
in
the
royalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
there
hadn't
been
a
provision
for
reduction
of
the
royalty
in
the
event
that
there
was
no
patent
then
you
would
agree
they
were
piggybacking
on
the
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
it
would
be
a
different
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
would
be
the
result?
