mr.
edward
j.
nowak
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court.
this
case
directly
puts
in
issue
the
rights
of
our
citizens
to
be
free
from
arrest
or
seizures
for
purposes
of
police
investigation
without
probable
cause
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
our
constitution,
and
as
applied
by
this
court
in
1975
to
the
case
of
brown
versus
illinois.
this
case
may
also
present
a
further
issue,
because
if
this
case
is
not
decided
in
accordance
with
brown
versus
illinois,
then
this
court
will
be
faced
with
resolving
the
issue
of
the
importance
of
the
--
or
the
important
right
of
our
citizens
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
seizures
for
purposes
of
investigative
detention.
a
question
that
was
left
open
by
this
court
in
terry
versus
ohio
and
again
left
open
in
morales
versus
new
york.
if
i
may
briefly
outline
the
facts,
there
was
a
murder
in
the
city
of
rochester
at
a
pizza
parlor,
march
26
of
1971.
the
proprietor
of
that
establishment
was
fatally
wounded
during
the
course
of
an
attempted
robbery.
the
next
fact
that
we
have
from
the
record,
we
do
not
know
what
the
police
did
from
the
record
between
march
26
and
august
10,
but
we
know
that
on
august
10,
the
police
received
information
from
an
inmate
who
was
incarcerated
in
the
monroe
county
jail
whom
they
had
never
used
before,
who
was
never
established
in
this
record
as
having
been
reliable.
they
received
information
from
this
mr.
sparrow,
indicating
that
a
mr.
cole
and
a
mr.
irving
axlerod
committed
this
particular
murder
at
the
pizza
parlor.
at
that
point
in
time,
the
police
officer
who
was
in
the
jail
called
the
lieutenant
in
charge
of
the
criminal
investigation
of
the
physical
crime
squad.
the
lieutenant
came
down
to
the
police
headquarters
at
about
8
o'clock
at
night,
and
he
questioned
mr.
sparrow
and
he
asked
sparrow
where
he
got
his
information.
how
did
he
come
about
knowing
this?
sparrow
indicated
that
cole
told
he
did
it.
the
police
had
then
went
and
confronted
cole
who
at
that
time
was
also
incarcerated
in
the
monroe
county
jail.
after
two
hours
of
questioning,
cole
persisted
and
denied
any
involvement
whatsoever
in
this
homicide.
he
said,
“i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
but
i'll
tell
you
who
did,
i
didn't
do
it
but
irving
axlerod
did
it
with
another
guy
called
ba
ba
adams.”
the
police
at
that
point
said,
“who
told
you
this
mr.
cole?”
“somebody
else,
adam's
brother
a
guy
named
hubert
adams.”
“well
where
is
hubert
adams?”
“he's
in
the
elmira
correctional
facility”,
which
is
about
90
miles
south
of
rochester.
what
did
the
police
do?
again,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
mr.
cole
is
a
person
charged
with
a
crime,
never
having
been
used
at
all
in
any
way.
his
reliability
has
never
been
established.
and
while
his
reliability
had
never
been
established,
he
is
denying
that
he
was
involved
in
this
crime
which
is
the
original
information
that
they
got
that
he
was
involved.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
at
the
monroe
county
jail.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
he
was
incarcerated
then
they
took
him
to
from
the
jail
to
an
interview
room
and
questioned
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
he
was
in
jail
on
other
charges,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
no
he
wasn't.
now,
cole
gave
this
information.
now,
what
did
the
police
do
when
they
had
this
information?
they
didn't
go
question
hubert
adams
who
was
the
source
of
the
information
to
try
to
verify
an
unreliable
informant,
instead
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i've
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
it
would
be
preferable
if
he
did.
if
he
didn't,
it
must
be
verified
by
some
other
source.
okay?
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
if
the
police
hear
from
him
the
first
time
and
they
can
--
then
they
go,
like
to
the
scene,
and
what
they
see
if
a
person
on
a
tip
says,
“so
and
so
is
selling
marijuana
and
possesses
--
and
also
has
a
firearm
and
he's
on
the
corner
of”
--
let's
pick
two
streets
--
“main
street
and
state
street.”
and
the
police
go
to
the
corner
and
there
is
a
guy
dressed
as
the
informer
said,
he
would
be.
okay,
then
we
have
a
different
situation
because
now
they've
acted
on
some
information,
they
have
gone
and
they've
been
able
to
corroborate
what
his
story
was.
in
this
case,
the
police
took
no
action
to
corroborate
this
person
who
just
gave
them
some
information
while
he's
denying
his
own
guilt
and
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
no
because
they
didn't
corroborate
it
before.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
but
they
didn't
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
there
is
no
authority
and
i
think
this
is
the
first
case
that
we'll
talk
about
that
particular
point
of
law.
in
drug
or
firearm
cases,
we
have
--
there
are
cases
that
indicate
the
tip
must
be
substantiated
to
some
form.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
right.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
there
is
no
issue
on
that.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
there
is
no
issue
whatsoever.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
every
court
has
held
there
is
no
probable
cause
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
and
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
right
but
the
argument
will
come
down
to
reasonable
suspicion
when
whether
or
not
that
existed
and
that's
why
i'm
talking
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
what
subsequently
followed
was
that
the
police
then
issued
an
order
to
go
pick
up
and
bring
in
mr.
dunaway
acting
on
this
information.
and
that
night
two
teams
of
police
officers
went
out
were
unable
to
locate
mr.
dunaway
during
the
evening
hours.
and
at
8
o'clock
on
the
morning
they
went
to
his
house.
upon
arrival
at
this
house
they
asked
where
he
was,
his
mother
said,
he's
not
home.
the
police
officers,
“well,
i'm
going
to
see
for
myself”
and
they
walked
in
and
looked
through
the
house,
mr.
dunaway
was
not
there.
another
officer
who
was
with
this
team
was
standing
watch
of
the
house
to
make
sure
as
he
said,
“no
one
jumps
from
windows
or
tried
to
run
out
the
backdoor.”
he
noticed
a
young
lady
leave
the
house
and
go
to
a
house
three
doors
down,
so
when
the
team
of
detectives
who
entered
the
house
came
back
out,
he
said,
“let's
follow
her
‘cause
she
went
a
couple
of
houses
over
and
he
might
be
there.”
as
they
went
to
the
house,
mr.
dunaway
was
there.
mr.
dunaway
was
subsequently
taken
downtown
by
the
police
and
questioned.
we
have
a
fact
that
now
becomes
now
important,
i
think
to
the
entire
issue
and
in
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
arrested
or
seized
in
accordance
with
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
the
police
said,
to
--
the
police
testimony
is,
“we
asked
him
if
he
would
go
downtown
with
us”,
and
he
said,
“yes.”
the
defendant's
testimony
is
that
they
came
up
and
they
said,
“we're
going
downtown
to
question
you.”
and
then
one
of
the
officers
grabbed
him
by
the
belt
of
his
pants
and
led
him
toward
the
police
car.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
there
were
three
police
officers.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
three
police
officers
who
stood
--
who
stands
6'3”
over
210
pounds.
this
defendant's
an
18
year
old
black
youth
who
weighs
about
145
pounds.
now
the
findings
of
fact
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
it
certainly
would.
the
hearing
court
in
fact
found
that
there
was
an
arrest
in
this
case.
the
issue
that
comes
forth
is
that
the
appellate
division
found
that
the
defendant
went
voluntarily.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
did
not
deny
this
permission
to
appeal,
dismissed
our
application.
we
filed
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
no,
that's
the
exact
point
that
i'm
about
to
make
your
honor,
is
that
if
a
person
is
accosted
by
the
police
and
goes
along
voluntarily,
there
are
many
federal
cases
which
hold
that
that
still
constitutes
an
arrest
as
long
as
the
person
being
seized
feels
that
he
is
so
restricted.
and
the
testimony
in
this
case,
which
is
crucial,
is
that
mr.
dunaway
asked
the
police
in
the
police
car
while
going
downtown,
“why
do
we
have
to
go
downtown?”
and
the
police
said,
“you'll
find
out
when
we
get
there.”
now
i
think
that
that
type
of
a
request
indicates
that
the
police
had
seized
this
individual
and
in
fact
had
arrested
him.
at
this
point
in
time,
they
didn't
answer
his
direct
request
to
find
out
why
they
had
to
go
downtown.
and
the
record,
i
think,
is
also
clear
that
there
was
an
objection
to
one
of
the
questions
about
putting
emphasis,
counselor
on
the
word
“had”
and
the
court
said,
“objection
overruled,
the
officer
knows
what
were
driving
at”
and
the
officers
says,
“well,
if
i
remember
correctly,
that's
what
he
said,
why
do
we
have
to
go
downtown.”
and
so
i
think
that
the
state
of
the
mind
of
this
defendant
is
clear
that
he
felt
he
was
arrested.
it's
also
clear
from
the
stipulation
on
the
record
that
the
people
who
stipulated
the
--
officers
when
they
went
out
intended
to
arrested
because
the
officers
many
times
had
said,
“when
we
have
a
warrant
of
arrest,
our
directive
is
to
pick
them
up
and
bring
them
in.”
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
the
agreed
that
there
was
a
detention,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
well,
they
said,
he
went
along
voluntarily,
but
a
detention
and
i
don't
see
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
the
appellate
division
opinion
in
the
record,
i
believe
it's
page
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
there
was
an
opinion
by
the
appellate
division
the
second
time
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
of
the
appendix.
in
quoting
some
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
they
say
he
went
along
voluntarily.
and
it's
my
statement
that
when
you
are
arrested
you
need
not
resist
arrest.
and
the
holding
of
the
various
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct,
it
says
that
as
well.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
it
did,
and
that's
why
i
don't
know
why
the
appellate
division
threw
in
the
word
voluntarily.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
and
the
appellate
division
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
moore
(ph)
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
he
quotes
the
police
testimony.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
but
that's
contrary
to
the
finding
of
the
fact
made
by
the
hearing
court
who
says
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
our
application.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
our
application
for
permission
to
appeal,
and
so
we
filed
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
as
of
--
as
an
affirmed
finding
of
fact
i
say
that
that's
true,
they
didn't
but
they've
put
the
word
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that
s
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
and
the
people
are
contending
in
point
one
of
their
brief
that
he
did
go
along
voluntarily
and
this
was
a
consensual
case.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
pardon?
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
to
the
court
at
this
time
that
i
think
that
the
finding
is
otherwise,
but
the
people
say
that
he
did
go
along
voluntarily
and
they're
relying
on
the
use
of
the
word
voluntary
in
that
appellate
division
opinion.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i
don't
see
how
they
can
use
it
when
they
say
it
at
the
same
he
was
detained,
it
seems
to
me
a
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
okay,
i'd
be
happy
to
your
honor.
it's
my
feeling
that
under
the
law
of
brown
versus
illinois,
this
petitioner
was
arrested.
he
was
also
arrested
concedingly
without
probable
cause
and
the
question
becomes
as.
“do
we
apply
the
exclusionary
rule?”
and,
“was
the
confession
attenuated
from
the
initial
illegality?”
that
is
the
detention
of
this
person
at
police
headquarters
without
probable
cause.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
it
does
talk
about
seizure
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
well,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
--
if
a
person's
arrested
he
is
seized
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
--
and
you're
going
along
voluntarily
with
the
police
is
not
consent
and
there
are
two
different
terms
of
art.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
--
they
didn't
do
that.
that's
a
significant
factor
that
they
didn't
ask
him
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
--
by
phone.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
three
officers.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
they
said,
“we
want
to
talk
to
you
downtown.”
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
no
i
don't
believe
that's
what
they
meant
by
that.
they
felt
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
--
that
the
detention
was
legal
because
of
the
application
of
a
--
of
the
morales
case,
which
is
a
new
york
court
of
appeals
case,
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
--
what
it
says,
“you
can
detain
people
on
reasonable
suspicion
and
not
probable
cause.”
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
and
that's
why
they
classified
the
detention
as
being
legal.
and
it
--
in
my
opinion
it's
clearly
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
we
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
there
is
now
the
attenuation
if
needed
in
applying
the
criteria
as
established
by
this
court
in
brown.
the
first
criteria
is
the
proximity
of
the
arrest
to
the
confession.
in
brown,
there
were
two
hours
between
the
initial
arrest
and
the
detention.
in
this
case,
there
was
one
hour.
was
there
any
intervening
circumstance,
the
entering
of
counsel,
the
arraignment
before
a
local
magistrate,
in
brown
there
was
none,
in
this
case
there
was
none.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
official
misconduct
in
this
case?
it
was
clearly
by
the
police,
his
own
admission
for
purposes
of
interrogation
exactly
the
same
in
proper
purpose
in
brown.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
my
view
is
that,
at
this
time
under
the
law
of
brown
it
can
not
when
he's
brought
in
because
in
effect
he
is
arrested
at
that
point
in
time.
when
he
is
brought
in,
in
that
type
of
a
fashion
he
can
not
be
--
what
was
done
to
this
petitioner
can
not
be
done
to
any
one
for
any
purpose,
they
need
probable
cause.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
for
fingerprinting
or
for
a
lineup,
now
there
could
be
a
situation
could
be
developed
where
they
could
go
to
his
house
and
say
to
him,
“would
you
like
to
come?”
and
he
says,
“no.”
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
okay.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
right.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
they'd
take
them
him
forcibly.
if
the
police
try
to
setup
an
appointment
with
him
if
they
go
to
his
house
and
say
“we
would
like
to
question,
let's
sit
here
and
have
a
talk.”
that
might
pose
a
different
problem
because
he
may
not
be
seized
for
purposes
of
fourth
amendment,
but
once
seized,
i
think
you
need
probable
cause.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i
think
that
the
court
held
that
in
davis
versus
mississippi.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
and
it
--
that's
why
i
feel
that
that
is
the
law
of
the
state.
the
last
issue
under
brown
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
attenuation
after
a
purpose
of
the
misconduct
is
the
flagrancy.
and
this
is
where
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
between
myself
and
the
district
attorney's
office.
the
purpose
or
the
flagrancy
of
this
conduct
--
what
is
flagrant
official
misconduct,
i
guess
is
the
real
question.
and
i
think
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
powell
in
brown
versus
illinois,
he
said,
that
there
are
three
types
or
three
examples
he
gave
of
official
flagrant
and
misconduct.
the
first
is
when
the
police
clearly
act
without
probable
cause.
the
second
is
when
they
make
a
pretext
arrest
and
thirdly,
when
they
go
in
with
arms,
weapons
drawn
without
probable
cause.
and
he
cites
those
three
examples.
clearly
brown
fell
within
example
three.
he
was
accosted
at
gun
point
in
his
own
home.
example
three
does
not
apply
to
this
case
and
therefore
the
people
say
there's
no
flagrancy.
but
if
you
look
at
mr.
justice
powell's
concurring
opinion,
he
says
that
the
first
example
he
gives
is
when
they
make
an
arrest
without
probable
cause.
in
this
case
they
conceded
that
they
didn't
have
probable
cause,
they
were
directly
asked
by
the
defense
attorney
on
cross-examination.
they
said,
“did
you
have
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant
or
did
you
go
get
a
warrant?”
and
he
said,
“i
didn't
go
get
a
warrant
because
i
knew
i
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
get
one.”
yet
knowing
this
they
went
to
his
house
and
seized
him,
and
i
submit
to
you
as
the
dissent
at
the
appellate
division
clearly
stated
this
constitutes
flagrant
official
misconduct
when
the
police
know
they
don't
have
probable
cause
and
they
act
without
it.
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
flagrant
misuse
of
official
misconduct
and
the
exact
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as
it
was
used
in
brown
would
be
served
again
by
applying
it
in
this
case.
i
would
only
point
out
that
originally
in
1975
when
brown
versus
illinois
was
decided,
this
case
had
been
up
with
this
court
and
certiorari
was
granted
and
it
was
remanded
for
a
rehearing
and
we
are
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
morales
in
my
opinion
your
honor
has
never
been
the
law
because
it's
been
dicta,
and
i
think
if
the
court
would
examine
the
opinion
in
morales
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
if
in
fact
the
police
are
acting
under
a
statute
which
is
later
declared
invalid,
there
are
court
cases
which
indicate
that
the
police
are
acting
in
good
faith
and
that
is
a
criteria
to
consider.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i
don't
believe
that
it
is,
but
in
any
event
what
if
there
was
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i
think
it's
their
interpretation
of
what
the
federal
constitution
says,
and
that's
what
the
new
york
court
did.
they
said,
“we
interpret
the
federal
constitution
as
saying
this
and
we're
going
to
hold
that
this
is
in
fact
the
case.”
if
the
police
were
aware
of
morales,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
when
they
testified
at
the
hearing
in
1977
that
was
conducted,
they
would've
said,
“counselor,
we
don't
need
probable
cause
to
pick
them
up,
we
only
need
reason
of
suspicion.”
but
they
didn't,
if
they
were
aware
of
morales,
that's
what
would've
said.
now
given
the
fact
that
they
did
or
even
if
they
were
acting
in
some
sort
of
good
faith
to
a
law
which
i
say
is
still
not
on
the
books
in
the
state
of
new
york
because
it
was
dicta,
the
court
of
appeals
when
morales
came
back
said,
that
he
consented
to
the
police
seizure
and
therefore
we
never
get
to
the
question
we
addressed.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
no
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they
should,
but
i'm
saying
that
there
really
was
no
reason
or
reasonable
way
or
reason
for
the
police
to
believe
this
was
the
law
in
the
state
of
new
york.
but
even
if
it
was,
good
faith
alone
i
don't
think
should
control.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
exactly
what
i
feel.
they
wanted
to
solve
this
murder
and
they
were
going
to
go
get
this
defendant
instead
of
following
leads
that
they
had
available
to
him,
and
i
don't
think
that's
proper.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
she
was
bound
by
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
in
morales.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
but
the
morales
opinion,
i
would
only
ask
the
court
to
note
that
that
opinion
specifically
makes
the
--
all
the
findings
that
she
relies
on
and
then
says,
“we
have
a
second
basis
for
our
holding.”
that
is
the
defendant
morales
consented
to
the
police
detention,
and
therefore
it
aviated
the
real
purpose
of
the
rule
they
were
seeking
to
develop.
they
said,
that
he
consented
when
they
--
when
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i
guess
it
could
be
said,
both
holdings,
maybe
they
made
two
separate
ones
and
then
there
was
no
need
to
make
it
because
they
were
relying
on
a
consent
issue.
when
an
application
for
petition
--
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
made
to
this
court
it
was
denied.
and
i
think
properly
so
because
there
was
no
question
because
he
consented.
this
court
specifically
remanded
morales
to
find
out
if
he
was
arrested,
whether
he
consented
and
whether
there
was
probable
cause.
and
they
said,
he
was
not
arrested
because
he
consented.
and
i
think
that
obviously
answers
the
question
that
this
court
was
seeking
to
address
at
that
point
in
morales,
and
that's
why
i
say
it
really
never
became
the
law.
but
even
if
it
did,
and
the
court
wishes
to
look
at
good
faith,
it
is
only
one
of
the
three
or
four
criteria
that
should
be
attached
to
attenuation.
and
i
think
there
is
no
way
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
attenuation.
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
dunaway
was
seized
for
purposes
of
interrogation.
this
court
in
1975
remanded
this
case
for
further
consideration
of
brown
versus
illinois.
the
hearing
court
took
in
all
the
testimony
and
found
as
a
fact
that
this
defendant
was
arrested,
he
was
arrested
without
probable
cause
and
in
their
--
in
the
hearing
court's
opinion
even
without
reasonable
suspicion.
and
further,
the
people
offered
absolutely
no
evidence
at
the
hearing
to
show
attenuation.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
if
one
finds
attenuation?
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
before
one
gets
to
that
question
the
threshold
question
is,
is
there
a
voluntary
confession
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments?
if
you
answer
that
question
yes,
then
we
go
the
fourth
amendment
question
that
was
posited
in
brown.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
and
there
is
no
claim
that
this
confession
was
not
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
no
there
isn't,
and
the
same
--
this
is
the
facts
of
brown
and
i
say
that
our
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
should
the
confession
be
suppressed,
should
be
the
exclusionary
rule
be
applied?
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
then
it's
admissible
in
evidence
because
the
purge
of
the
initial
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
you
are
looking
to
see
if
the
defendant's
statement
was
sufficiently
and
independent
intervening
act
of
freewill.what
was
in
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
well,
that's
where
i
disagree
because
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
voluntariness
under
the
fifth
amendment
is
one
question.
but
an
act
of
freewill
and
independent
intervening
act
of
freewill,
which
is
what
this
court
specifically
drew
upon
in
the
wong
sun
case
and
again
in
brown,
because
brown's
confession
was
voluntary.
the
court
looked
and
said,
“can
we
say
that
his
act
of
confessing
was
not
a
result
of
the
police
illegality
if
they
went
in
and
seized
him
trying
to
get
some
evidence?”
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that,
the
voluntariness.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
it
was
voluntary.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct,
and
if
it's
sufficiently
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
the
matter
--
there
are
certain
facets
annunciated
in
brown.
one
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
one
was
the
arrest.
did
they
exploit
the
illegal
detention
to
get
this
confession?
or
was
he
detained,
was
he
arrested
illegally,
was
he
taken
to
the
courtroom,
was
he
arraigned
given
a
lawyer?
and
then
he
says,
“look
i
got
a
lawyer
and
i've
talked
to
him
but
i
still
want
to
confess.”
the
court
can
look
at
that
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
and
say,
“that
was
an
act
of
his
own
will
after
he
had
knew
what
was
going
on.”
they
didn't
exploit
the
illegal
arrest
to
get
that
confession
from
him,
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
defendant
is
illegally
arrested
and
as
a
result
of
that
arrest
directly
within
hours,
minutes
of
being
seized
gives
a
confession.
he's
never
been
--
i'll
had
a
lawyer
under
the
proceedings,
he's
never
been
arraigned.
the
purpose
was
not
to
legitimately
arrest
him
to
charge
him
with
a
crime,
but
was
for
investigation.
the
court
looks
at
the
balancing
and
says,
“the
weight
is
on
the
side
--
on
the
wrong
side
here,
this
confession
must
be
excluded
because
it
was
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
despite
the
fact
it
was
obtained
properly
under
the
fifth
and
sixth.”
and
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
says
is,
“if
you
can
comply
with
the
fifth
and
sixth,
we'll
forget
the
fourth.”
and
that's
what
i
submit
that
they've
tried
to
do
in
this
particular
case,
and
because
they've
tried
to
do
that,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
be
reversed.
judge
mark's
original
decision,
after
hearing
all
the
evidence
in
this
case
should
in
fact
be
reinstated.
the
confession
suppressed
and
his
judgment
reversed.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
well
wong
sun
is
also
the
doctrine
that
--
the
case
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
yes,
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct
it's
totally
separate
and
apart
from
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
it's
the
product
of
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct
it's
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
arrest
or
detention.
if
there'd
be
no
other
questions
and
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
as
a
point
of
fact
just
for
the
record
for
whatever
purpose
it
has
the
district
attorney
has
indicated
that
the
officers
who
were
executing
the
arrest
didn't
know
anything
about
why
they
were
going
out
there
that
it
be
for
investigative
purposes
or
whatever.
i
think
clearly
in
the
record
that
is
to
the
contrary
on
page
a
58,
it
does
state
lieutenant
fantigrossi
as
being
examined
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
a
58,
page
58
of
the
appendix
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
--
the
second
answer
from
the
bottom,
it
states
“they
knew
just
as
much
about
the
case
as
i
did.”
fantigrossi's
saying
that
his
people
who
went
out
to
execute
this
arrest
for
investigatory
purposes
knew
just
as
much
about
the
case
as
he
did
so.
for
the
record,
i'd
like
to
clarify
that.
two
brief
points
and
they
are
that
the
respondent
has
contested
that
new
york
applies
this
rule
has
not
been
excessive
in
the
application
of
whatever
rule
they've
applied.
in
my
brief,
i've
cited
the
case
people
versus
anderson
in
which
i
was
counsel
for
the
defendant
before
the
court
of
appeals,
where
in
they
struck
down
mr.
anderson's
confession.
it
was
a
murder
case,
they
struck
it
down
and
he
was
detained
more
than
18
hours
by
the
police
until
he
finally
confessed,
and
they
noted
in
that
case
the
detention
was
illegal.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i
think
your
question
is
pointing
out
what
if
the
police
are
acting
in
good
faith
when
they're
trying
to
execute
at
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
if
we
can
presume,
which
i
still
would
contest
that
morales
is
the
law
then
i
would
say
that
if
that
is
a
factor
to
consider
in
--
and
possibly
whether
or
not
there's
a
sufficient
attenuation
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
it
--
well
it
was
rejected
in
that
case
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
--
as
well
as
i
believe
in
--
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
that's
correct,
but
beyond
that
good
faith
alone
should
not
be
an
excuse
to
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
think
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
in
many
cases
including
henry.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i
don't
believe
that
it
was,
but
even
if
it
was,
the
--
as
i
am
saying
that
--
what
we're
trying
to
prevent
here,
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
exclusionary
rule
and
my
position
is
that
we
should
not
make
our
citizens
prove
that
they
are
innocent
to
the
police
when
they
are
only
reasonably
suspected
of
criminal
activity.
and
that's
what
the
respondent
here
is
trying
to
urge
that
they
can
go
to
cole
on
reasonable
suspicion.
they
can
question
him
and
make
him
prove
his
innocence,
but
they
don't
have
probable
cause.
they
can
make
our
citizens
prove
because
it's
a
murder
case,
it's
serious.
they
can
make
our
citizens
prove
by
detaining
them
and
questioning
they
didn't
do
it,
and
that's
reasonable.
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not
reasonable
that
before
we
can
compel
our
citizens
and
be
interrogated
which
is
the
greatest
form
of
deprivation
of
liberty
in
police
headquarters,
probable
cause
is
required,
and
that
should
be
clear.
and
i
think
that
the
new
york
rule
should
be
definitely
overturned
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
minutes
--
while
he
was
confessing,
they
asked
him
if
he
would
show
them
how
what
he
means
and
he
did,
and
the
trial
court
as
well
said,
that
has
to
be
suppressed.
it's
the
fruit
of
that
illegal
detention,
while
he's
confessing
he's
drawing
a
diagram.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
they
were
voluntary
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment,
in
that
they
were
voluntary
because
he
was
read
his
rights
and
he
waived
them.
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment,
yes,
for
purposes
of
fourth
amendment
freewill
i
say
no.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
j.
nowak
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would,
i
think
--
mr.
edward
j.

he
would

he
would
be
seized.
in
my
position
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
would
be
yes
he's
seized.
they
need
probable
cause.
mr.
edward

as
long
as
they
are
in

correct.
mr.

a
whole
different
situation.
possibly
that
might
be
allowed
depending
in
the
nature
of
the
seizure
if
it
be
reasonable
if

there're
a
number
of
factors
that,
i
don't
know
if
time
would
permit
me
to

bear

the
exact
question
you've

the

of

on
the
street
not
in
police
headquarters,
more
beneficial,
more
reasonable
to
the
police.
what
was
the
length
of
it,
it's
brief,
not
long,
not
in
the
station
house.
are
there
any
exigencies,
which
is
a
crucial
element
in
determining
what's
reasonable
under
terry?
the
court
specifically
has
said,
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
are
what
control.
in
terry,
the
police
are
trying
to
prohibit
crime
not
solve
it

that

might

thank
you.
