mr.
melvin
bessler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
--
the
parties
have
framed
the
issues
in
some
detail,
but
the
real
issue
as
i
think,
the
bottom
line
issue
is
shall
this
concededly
voluntary
statement
be
suppressed.
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
two
separate
theories,
separate
theories
but
interrelated
why
they
should
not
--
why
it
should
not
and
why
the
statement
is
perfectly
good
as
it
is.
rather
obviously
those
two
theories
are
expressed
in
the
brown
v.
illinois
and
the
new
york
theory
which
i
will
refer
to
as
the
morales
theory,
for
simplicities
sake
which
i
think
the
court
now
is
aware
of.
there
are
one
or
two
preliminary
fact
--
factual
matters
i'd
like
to
go
into.
i
think
one
of
the
things
the
court
might
be
interested
in
is
officer
luciano's
part
in
this
whole
episode
from
the
appendix
and
the
testimony,
although
he
made
nothing
of
it
in
our
statement
of
the
briefs.
you
will
see
that
officer
luciano
was
at
headquarters
or
somewhere
nearby
when
he
was
told
to
go
pick
up
the
other
two
officers,
nicholson
and
ruvio,
and
to
--
he
was
searching
them
around.
he
really
knew
nothing
about
what
they
were
doing,
they
told
him,
“well,
we
got
to
go
hear”
and
they
said,
“by
the
way,
let
us
stop
off
and
see
if
this
guy
dunaway
is
home.
we
tried
before
and
he
wasn't
there.”
he
was
just
a
(inaudible)
so
to
speak.
he
had
no
part
in
it.
when
they
got
out
of
the
car
to
do
whatever
they
were
doing,
he'll
--
he
hung
back.
he
didn't
go
to
the
first
house
to
dunaway's
home,
he
stayed
in
the
driveway
and
used
his
eyes,
his
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
there
was
a
question
before,
your
honor,
about
the
fact
that
there
were
three
officers
and
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
it
comes
down
to
the
question
of
the
voluntariness.
it
happens
that
he
was
the
officer
who
was
right
there.
and
then
also
later
on,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
illegal
exploitation
of
the
arrest
if
it
was
illegal.
now
if
i
understand
what
this
court
told
us
in
brown
as
an
extension
of
wong
sun,
it
has
to
be
a
balancing
test.
in
order
for
the
rule
to
apply,
you
assume
the
initial
illegality,
and
wherefore
the
purposes
of
argument
will
be
about
here.
we'll
assume
that
the
initial
detention,
we
don't
concede
it
but
we'll
assume
it,
was
improper.
from
that
point
on
there
was
no
exploitation
of
any
illegality.
the
two
officers
or
the
three
officers
who
transported
him
downtown
never
spoke
to
him,
there
were
no
drawn
guns,
there
were
no
threats,
there
was
no
bodily
movement,
they
did
not
manhandle
him,
they
did
not
put
him
in
handcuffs.
when
he
got
downtown
he
was
not
booked,
he
was
not
fingerprinted,
he
was
brought
immediately
to
an
interview
room.
in
the
interview
room,
he
was
questioned
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
i'm
suggesting
that
they
did
not
seek
to
exploit
the
illegality
assuming
that
the
initial
detention
was
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
that's
correct.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
your
honor
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
at
the
--
almost
the
moment
he
walked
into
the
room,
he
was
given
his
full
miranda
warnings.
mr.
melvin
bessler
i
assume
not
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
bessler
therefore,
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
make
a
comparison
between
this
case
and
the
brown
test
on
this
balancing
question.
mr.
melvin
bessler
that
is
correct
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
i
accept
that
but
i
am
saying
that
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
officers
in
the
first
place
acted
in
good
faith
because
they
were
following
what
was
then
the
law
of
new
york,
where
they
did
nothing
of
it
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
that's
correct,
but
in
exercising
your
judgment
in
a
balancing
test
as
was
expressed
in
terry
and
adamson
and
few
other
cases,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
question
i
would
like
answered
or
what
i
think
favors
us
is
that
if
the
police
act
in
good
faith
and
we
assume
the
illegality
and
they
do
very
little
if
anything
to
exploit
that
illegality
other
than
move
him
from
one
place
to
another
against
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
--
and
then
question
him
after
warning
him
of
his
miranda
rights
telling
him
that
he
doesn't
have
to
speak,
that
he
can
have
a
lawyer
and
that
he
can
terminate
it
at
any
time,
that
under
such
cases
the
two-pronged
reasons
for
excluding
are
not
benefited.
if
i
understand
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
it
is
to
protect
the
court's
integrity
so
they
had
not
using
tainted
evidence
and
in
addition
to
have
a
deterrent
effect.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
would
have
no
deterrent
effect
because
the
police
thought
they
were
doing
what
was
allowed,
and
matter
of
fact
arguably
to
this
moment
that
is
the
law
of
new
york,
morales
allows
that.
mr.
melvin
bessler
no
but
your
honor
i
am
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
i
argued
morales
in
the
new
york
courts
your
honor
which
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
no,
no
we
were
the
appellants
the
last
time
up.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes,
the
trial
court
suppressed,
we
appealed.
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
of
course
the
argument
--
the
question
before
the
appellate
division
was
somewhat
different
than
it
is
now.
there
--
in
new
york
--
in
the
new
york
courts
morales
is
the
law
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
majority
opinion
rested
it
mostly
on
those
grounds,
also
on
brown
grounds,
of
course
we
argued
both.
there
was
a
split,
there
was
a
four
to
one,
one
dissent,
three
concurrences
on
the
morales
theory
and
the
brown
theory
and
a
concurring
opinion
on
morales
only,
that
was
justice
denman.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
in
exercising
this
balancing
test,
one
of
the
things
i
assume
you
would
want
to
know
is
if
suppression
is
to
be
had,
will
it
benefit
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
i'm
saying
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
it
will
not.
on
two
grounds,
in
the
first
place,
as
they
already
tried
to
indicate,
there
would
be
no
deterrent
effect
if
the
police
reasonably
believe
they
are
following
the
law
as
it
exists,
and
the
testimony
of
the
officer
on
the
stand
clearly
indicates
that
it
does.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
it,
it's
at
--
it's
on
our
brief
at
page
27
and
in
the
appendix
at
page
61.
the
officer
said,
he
had
“the
right
to
take
him
downtown,
i
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
him,
i
did
have
his
words
probable
cause
to
take
him
downtown”
which
was
his
way
of
saying
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
melvin
bessler
the
way
the
law
is
in
new
york
today,
that
is
correct,
you
do
not
your
honor.
now
speaking
strictly
to
the
question
of
attenuation,
if
i
understand
brown
correctly,
that
too
is
a
balance
of
a
different
sort.
the
extent
of
the
necessary
attenuation
to
separate
the
statement
from
the
presumed
illegality
is
always
a
question
of
fact,
if
i'm
correct.
that
i
am
suggesting
that
under
strict
brown
--
strictly
under
the
theory
espoused
in
brown,
the
good
faith
of
the
officers,
the
minimum
take,
the
lack
of
exploitation,
the
clearly
voluntary
nature
of
the
statement
itself
shows
that
there
was
a
separation
in
his
mind
when
he
made
the
statement
as
opposed
to
when
he
was
arrested,
assuming
again
that
there
was
an
illegality.
there's
a
separate
matter
which
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
as
well.
originally,
after
brown
after
the
defendant
dunaway
made
his
first
statement,
the
police
officer
left.
late
that
afternoon
or
early
evening
according
to
the
testimony
which
was
accepted,
he
asked
to
see
the
officers
again
and
they
came
back
late
in
--
later
in
the
evening
9
or
10
o'clock
after
their
tour
of
duty
had
long
--
was
long
over.
and
he
said
something
like,
it's
in
the
record,
he
said
something
like,
“look,
i
didn't
give
you
the
whole
story
before
i
want
to
make
it
clean,
the
rest
of
it.”
and
he
gave
them
a
much
more
detailed
statement.
now
he
started
to
name
names
and
he
cleaned
up
some
of
the
things
he
had
told
them
before
which
weren't
altogether
accurate.
at
trial
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing,
a
hunt
--
we
call
it
a
huntley
hearing,
a
pretrial
suppression
hearing,
at
which
both
statements
were
ruled
admissible,
however
it
was
a
joint
trial.
and
since
the
second
statement
had
the
names
of
the
other
defendants,
there
were
bruton
problems,
the
trial
attorney
decided
he
didn't
need
the
second
statement,
the
first
one
was
all
he
did
need
which
and
he
proved
himself
correct.
he
therefore
never
used
it,
but
i
would
also
suggest
the
fact
of
that
second
statement
being
absolutely
voluntary
to
pure
essence
since
the
defendant
called
the
police,
should
also
be
considered
on
the
attenuation
theory.
now
with
respect
to
what
facts
--
some
questions
arose
as
to
what
happened,
i
think
maybe
i
should
spend
a
minute
or
two
detailing
what
the
new
york
rules
are.
the
appellate
division
can
find
facts
--
the
intermediate
appellate
courts
in
the
state
of
new
york
can
find
facts.
ordinarily,
the
highest
court,
the
court
of
appeals
cannot,
they're
a
court
limited
to
questions
of
law
only.
in
this
case,
i
suggest
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
shows
that
the
appellate
division
did
find
facts,
and
the
facts
that
they
found
fully
credited
the
police
testimony
to
the
extent
that
there
was
any
conflict.
mr.
melvin
bessler
on
both
--
on
the
question
of
whether
it
--
he
voluntarily
went
downtown.
mr.
melvin
bessler
that
he
--
that's
correct.
that
he
consented
to
go
downtown.
mr.
melvin
bessler
may
i
have
a
moment
your
honor?
mr.
melvin
bessler
the
court
will
note
at
page
124
about
two
inches
below,
justice
moore
(ph)
says
a
little
bit
in,
“according
to
the
police
testimony,
defendant
was
asked
and
so
forth
and
did
so
voluntarily.”
mr.
melvin
bessler
later
on
in
the
opinion,
at
page
126
it
point
--
it's
indicated
with
a
bracket
at
two,
it
says,
“this
testimony
shows
that
the
police
legally
detained
the
defendant”
and
so
forth.”
and
then
it
says
at
the
top
of
page
127,
“even
if
we
were
to
find
that
the
actions
of
the
police
officers
constituted
an
illegal
detention
clearly
indicating
they
found
otherwise
as
a
separate
matter,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york
can
only
hear
questions
of
law.”
in
this
case
when
there
was
reversal,
our
rules
require
that
the
reversal
states
specifically
that
is
a
reversal
on
the
law.
if
it
doesn't
say
anything
or
says
law
and
facts
then
it
can
not
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
case,
there
was
a
motion
made
by
the
defendant,
petitioner
here,
after
the
appellate
division
holding
asking
them
to
amend
their
order
to
say
that
it
was
on
the
law
alone,
which
they
refused
to
do.
they
denied
the
motion
and
for
that
reason
it
could
never
be
heard
by
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
a
clear
indication
that
they
found
facts,
and
i'm
suggesting
the
facts
that
they
found
where
that
they
credit
it
to
the
police
testimony
with
respect
to
the
only
conflict
whether
or
not
he
came
voluntarily.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
your
honor
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
melvin
bessler
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
there
is
an
ambiguity,
no
question
about
it,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
we
--
if
the
entire
three-man
majority
opinion
is
read,
it
seems
clear
that
they
absolutely
credited
the
police
testimony
on
their
review
of
the
facts.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
bessler
that
certainly
a
firm
interpretation
your
honor,
i
would
urge
the
other
one
but
i
think
the
issue
is
clear
and
it's
understood.
mr.
melvin
bessler
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes,
i
do
your
honor
and
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i'd
like
to
explain
why.
mr.
melvin
bessler
to
the
extent
there's
a
distinction,
i
would
say
an
arrest,
no.
mr.
melvin
bessler
if
i
may,
i'll
explain
to
you
why
if
there
was
a
--
what
the
distinction
is.
if
there
is
a
seizure
the
court
of
appeals
new
york's
highest
court,
try
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
right
of
privacy
that
every
individual
has
under
the
constitution
which
is
essentially
what
the
fourth
amendment
provides.
and
what
i
call
the
police
imperative
to
investigate
and
if
possible
solve
a
crime.
now
we
have
here
the
most
serious
crime
that
man
can
be
confused
of,
and
that
is
he
--
the
taking
of
a
fellow
human's
life,
a
murder.
they
had
reached
an
impasse
and
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
strike
a
balance
and
the
balance
that
they
sought
to
strike
was
that
where
in
a
narrow
class
of
cases,
a
very
narrow
class
of
cases,
the
police
can
demonstrate,
they
can
articulate
that
they
have
reached
an
impasse
in
their
investigation.
but
that
they
have
reasonable
suspicion
which
is
a
step
below
probable
cause
to
suspect
that
one
or
more
individuals
either
has
information
about
the
crime
or
may
be
a
defendant
that
is
a
perpetrator.
they
can
detain
him
for
a
brief
period
under
carefully
controlled
conditions
after
fully
advising
him
of
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
as
i
understand
it,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said,
“if
you
do
that,
then
such
a
detention
is
not
unreasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment”
and
that
is
pretty
much
what
i'm
urging
on
this
court,
contrast
that
with
an
arrest.
in
an
arrest,
in
the
first
place
there's
a
booking
procedure
which
they
determined
to
be
not
carefully
controlled
proceedings,
he
may
or
probably
will
be
handcuffed.
he
will
be
under
a
clear
threat
of
the
police
power
as
clear
as
you
can
be,
he's
is
being
handcuffed,
take
him
down,
fingerprint,
get
photographed
and
so
forth.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
your
honor,
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
or
petitioner
himself
said
that
he
put
his
hand
on
his
belt
and
guided
him
to
the
car.
that
was
disputed
by
each
officer.
each
officer
testified,
paraphrasing
“i
didn't
touch
him,
i
didn't
see
or
don't
remember
if
the
other
officer
did.”
they
each
testified
that
they
didn't
touch
him,
and
as
i
say
that's
another
part
of
the
testimony
that
i
believe
the
appellate
division
credited.
now
the
unfortunate
part
here
is
there
was
a
concession
by
the
trial
attorney
in
this
case
that
he
was
in
detention
from
the
moment
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
police.
therefore,
the
trial
judge
never
made
a
finding
on
the
question
you
asked
your
honor,
he
never
made
a
finding
because
he
felt
he
didn't
have
to.
he
accepted
the
concession
of
detention
and
the
reason
quite
clearly
is
at
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
a
reasonably
brief
period
of
time,
i
guess
pretty
much
like
brown,
you
have
to
judge
it
--
each
case
on
it
facts.
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
your
honor
in
this
case
he
made
a
--
he
started
to
make
--
he
waived
his
rights
and
commenced
making
a
statement
within
a
very
few
minutes
after
he
was
questioned.
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
but
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
well,
but
i
don't
think
at
that
time
he
was
advised
of
his
fifth
and
sixth
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
he
was
not
advised
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
then
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
intermediate
period,
the
20,
30
or
40
minute
trip
downtown
from
the
time
he
was
first
deprived
of
his
immediate
liberty.
again
i
ask
the
court
to
remember
we
are
suggesting
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
why?
mr.
melvin
bessler
that
question
of
course
is
not
clear
on
the
record.
i
will
--
i
can
speculate
and
show
many
reasons
why
it
might
be
done.
mr.
melvin
bessler
it
is
not,
i
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
those
officers,
especially
the
two
officers
who
were
assigned
to
the
case
could
not,
because
a,
they
weren't
assigned
to
that
detail,
and
b,
knew
very
little
about
the
case.
it
was
a
notorious
case
and
it's
possible
they
knew
quite
a
bit
about
it
from
carter
thought,
hearsay
and
reading
the
newspapers
the
same
way
i
might
have
without
being
involved
or
anyone
else.
but
they
were
not
specifically
charged
with
the
investigation,
they
didn't
know
the
names
of
these
other
people.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
he
certainly
could've
but
that
would
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
your
honor
he
certainly
could
have.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
it
would
because
he
didn't
know
any
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
he
didn't
know
where
he
was.
mr.
melvin
bessler
that's
correct.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
and
that
would've
meant
that
they
detained
him
in
the
street
or
in
somebody's
house
for
the
same
period
of
time
while
the
officer
is
coming
downtown.
forgive
me
your
honor,
i
can't
see
--
if
that's
--
if
they
can't
bring
him
downtown
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
there
certainly
is
your
honor,
however
please
consider
the
facts.
mr.
melvin
bessler
well,
let
us
consider
the
facts
here.
he
was
found
at
someone
else's
house
not
his
own.
there
were
people
in
the
other
house,
could
the
police
reasonably
barge
into
somebody's
house
and
say,
“we
want
to
talk
to
you
here”
even
if
he
consented.
mr.
melvin
bessler
i
know
you
didn't
your
honor,
but
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes
they
could've.
i
would
however
respectfully
your
honor
suggest
that
if
there
is
something
wrong,
if
there
is
something
oppressive
about
being
in
a
police
station
in
an
open
room,
there
is
just
something
even
more
oppressive
about
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
what
i
mean
is
it's
a
large
room
with
a
desk
and
a
table.
mr.
melvin
bessler
i
didn't
mean
unlocked.
i
did
not
mean
unlocked,
i
am
comparing
the
room
to
a
--
questioning
him
in
a
police
car
for
example
which
if
they'd
ask
me
i
would
have
said,
it's
outrageous,
don't
you
dare
do
it.
police
car
--
a
police
car
is
i
think
a
more
inherently
coercive
than
rooms
are,
that's
a
personal
opinion
i
obviously
not
binding
on
any
one.
i
think
the
real
knob
of
the
question
is
this,
if
the
police
want
to
investigate
this
matter
and
they
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
a
certain
individual
knows
something
about
the
crime,
what
they
want
is
an
exchange
of
ideas.
they
want
communication,
you
can't
--
if
you
stop
people
on
a
street,
unfortunately
in
our
society
in
certain
parts
of
town
all
you'll
going
to
get
is
an
argument
in
a
crowd.
some
people
know
that
they
--
whether
they
want
to
talk
to
the
police
or
not,
they
can't
do
it
on
their
own,
if
i
can
use
the
word
turf,
it's
a
put
down,
it's
not
cool
to
use
the
language.
they
may
be
very
willing
to
talk,
willing
in
the
purest
sense
somewhere
else
but
not
where
they
can
be
seen
because
they
would
lose
face
with
their
fellows
and
their
compatriots,
the
people
with
whom
they
have
to
live,
their
peers
so
to
speak.
as
accepted
matter,
it
is
not
conducive
to
an
exchange
of
ideas
now
for
example,
contrast
the
questioning
of
dunaway
with
the
questioning
of
cole.
cole
was
just
as
much
under
suspicion
when
they
questioned
him,
and
because
they
were
able
to
talk
to
him
he
was
able
to
convince
them
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
other
than
the
hearsay
that
is
--
he
did
not
participate.
he
was
able
to
convince
them
that
he
was
innocent,
and
they
went
to
the
next
step.
mr.
melvin
bessler
he
was
your
honor.
now
as
a
separate
matter,
although
no
one
has
--
the
question
has
not
yet
arisen,
one
obvious
argument
along
those
lines
your
honor
might
be
why
they
didn't
go
to
elmira.
incidentally,
i
disagree
to
his
90
miles,
i
think
it
was
closer
to
a
120
miles.
the
problem
you
have
with
going
down
to
see
hubert
adams
is
twofold.
in
the
first
place
the
information
that
they
had
gave
them
no
direct
evidence
concerning
dunaway.
if
they
credit
cole's
testimony,
coles
statement,
cole
heard
from
hubert
was
the
co-defended
ronald
ba
ba's
brother,
his
older
brother.
the
information
they
got
from
him
was
that
maybe
a
direct
statement
had
been
made
to
the
brother
but
not
direct
statement
had
been
made
by
dunaway.
the
would
just
have
another
layer
of
hearsay
to
contend
with
no
matter
what
hubert
adams
told
in
elmira,
they
still
had
to
go
talk
to
dunaway
and
they
would
be
in
no
better
position
than
they
were
before
they
left.
second
of
all,
when
you
have
someone
who
is
--
who
might
arguably
want
to
protect
his
own
brother
more
so
than
he
might
want
to
protect
dunaway
who
is
not
his
brother,
anything
that
he
said,
anything
that
adam
said,
is
immediately
suspect.
he
might
promise
them
anything
either
to
get
his
brother
off
the
hook
or
to
get
a
better
deal
for
himself
or
a
better
jail
assignment
or
parole
time
or
whatever.
it
seems
to
me
they
made
a
practical
decision,
and
of
course
ba
ba
was
a
juvenile
and
i
don't
think
they
knew
where
he
was.
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
they
were
looking
for
him
too.
it
was
just
coincidence
that
they
found
dunaway
first
within
a
day
or
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
tried
to
develop
a
middle
ground,
a
balancing
test
between
not
investigating
at
all,
that
is
the
--
and
taking
a
step
further
without
compromising
the
rights
of
privacy
that
everybody
has
under
the
fourth
amendment.
if
this
case
were
very,
very
recent
it
would
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
well,
if
you
have
reasonable
suspicion
i
cannot
answer
you
directly,
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
would
suggest
that
there
you
can
get
a
warrant
because
there's
provision
for
it.
there's
no
provision
for
a
warrant.
i
had
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
i
believe
that
that
is
considered
less
intrusive
if
you
have
--
if
i
recollect
--
if
i
recall
correctly
in
davis
that
this
court
condemned
dragnet
procedures.
but
it
seems
to
me
either
between
the
lines
are
in
dicta,
there
was
an
argument
that
if
they
could
show
specifically
that
they
were
looking
for
this
individual
and
for
what
reason
then
maybe
there
would
be
a
method
of
legally
by
with
judicial
supervision
bringing
him
down
to
fingerprint
him.
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
i
think
the
question
posited
was
that
there
was
not
probable
cause.
mr.
melvin
bessler
just
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
melvin
bessler
that
is
correct.
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
a
lineup
presents
an
altogether
different
problem,
because
with
a
lineup
you
have
a
live
witness,
somebody
who
could
identify
him
and
if
you
have
a
live
witness
there
are
other
ways
that
you
can
make
the
same
identification.
so
you
either
--
you
can
just
bring
him
down
and
say,
“that's'
the
guy”
and
would
you
have
probable
cause
when
you
don't
have
it
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
no,
forgive
me
your
honor
what
i
meant
was
assuming
that
i
am
the
suspect,
the
reasonably
suspected
person,
bring
the
victim
down
at
some
(inaudible)
you
say,
“you
see
anybody
you
know”
where
you
know
that
the
defendant,
myself
in
this
case
would.
and
he
can
say,
“that's
the
guy”
now
you
have
probable
cause.
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
i'm
trying
to
ask
you
a
specific
question.
my
own
opinion
is
that
the
courts,
the
new
york
courts
would
have
more
trouble
with
--
for
a
lineup
because
you
have
a
live
witness
than
when
you
can't
have
a
lineup
because
there's
no
live
witness.
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
you
may
be
correct.
i'm
being
a
little
cautious
about
speculating
because
one
of
the
things
they
have
thrown
these
cases
out.
what
i
started
to
say
was
that
there's
been
about
a
10-year
history
of
this
precise
rule
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
during
that
ten
years
there
has
been
no
excessive
police
behavior.
they
haven't
used
it
so
to
speak
as
a
whole
in
the
fourth
amendment
to
swoop
down
and
pick
people
up.
they
have
not
made
any
dragnets,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
intermediate
appellate
courts,
and
we've
cited
some
cases
in
our
briefs,
have
carefully
controlled
and
supervised.
there's
been
judicial
supervision
over
this
proceeding.
it
is
a
very
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes.
mr.
melvin
bessler
that
lineup
cases
have
always
found
a
way
to
get
a
court
order,
the
ones
i'm
familiar
with,
and
so
the
question
is
never
been
directly
answered.
i
don't
know
that
they
want
to
expand
it
any
further
because
you
have
to
remember
that
when
you
fingerprint,
well
i
guess
he
could
exculpate
himself
as
well.
the
real
underlying
theory
behind
morales,
as
i
understand
it
is
to
have
confrontation
between
the
suspect
who
may
be
witness
as
cole
was
so
that
he
himself
can
be
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
he
want
to
talk
or
not.
and
they
have
said,
under
the
controlled
conditions,
a
reasonably
brief
period
where
your
fourth
amendment
rights
are
protected
that
is
reasonable.
they
have
added
another
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
well
they
have
said,
that
under
those
circumstances
that
is
reasonable
and
they
have
merely
added
what
i
consider
another
dimension
to
the
definition
of
the
word
reasonable.
i
guess
the
argument
is
in
the
case
where
you
have
no
place
else
to
go,
where
serious
crime
has
been
committed
that
the
balancing
that
is
required
between
the
rights
to
privacy
and
the
rights
to
solve
these
crimes,
if
it
can
be
done
with
a
minimum
of
interference
should
save
an
investigation
because
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
no
i
disagree
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
bessler
because
no
crime
had
been
committed.
what
did
they
suspect
him
of?
secondly,
it
was
not
the
type
of
crime
that
couldn't
be
solved
another
way.
mr.
melvin
bessler
no,
but
--i
understand
that
your
honor
but
that's
not
the
type
of
crime
they're
talking
about.
they're
talking
about
a
crime
that
has
already
been
committed
and
almost
in
every
case
that's
reached
the
appellate
courts
where
this
issue
was
involved
it's
a
murder
case
where
there
was
no
live
witness.
they
have
never
allowed
it
in
any
other
case,
not
the
lower
courts,
not
any
court
that
i
know
of
in
the
state.
they
have
limited
it
strictly
to
murder
cases
where
there's
the
--
in
another
case
they
said,
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
either
as
a
witness
or
possibly
as
a
defendant,
where
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
he's
involved
and
--
mr.
melvin
bessler
yes.
mr.
melvin
bessler
it's
so
close
i
don't
know
of
a
case
that
separate
it,
because
usually
if
you
know
about
you
maybe
an
accomplice,
although
perhaps
not
chargeable
with
the
full
crime
under
investigation.
certainly
for
example,
cole
was
in
that
category,
they
surely
had
the
same
reasonable
suspicion
against
him
that
they
had
against
dunaway
after
talking
to
him.
he
convinced
them
in
this
conversation
he
had
with
them
that
he
had
knew
nothing
about
it
and
he
pointed
them
to
adams
and
to
dunaway,
well
actually
what
he
called
them
by
his
nickname.
mr.
melvin
bessler
that
is
correct,
that's
conceded.
thank
you
your
honors.
