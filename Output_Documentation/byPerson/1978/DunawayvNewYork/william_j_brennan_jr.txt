justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
haven't
you
already
held
that
just
mere
giving
miranda
warnings
doesn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
does
affect
the
illegality?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
now
you're
--
we've
assumed
--
we're
assuming
an
illegality.
we
assume
an
illegal
detention
or
illegal
seizure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
interrogate
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
a
brown
argument
at
all,
that's
not
a
brown
argument
at
all.
that's
just
an
argument
that
the
exclusionary
rule
shouldn't
apply
when
the
officers
have
some
subjective
or
objective
basis,
reasonable
basis,
for
doing
what
they
did.
that
isn't
an
attenuation
argument,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
--
i
don't
see
that
--
did
you
present
this
argument
to
the
appellate
division
that
even
if
it's
illegal
and
even
if
there
was
no
attenuation,
the
officers
were
nevertheless
in
good
faith
and
the
evidence
should
not
be
excluded,
you
didn't
argue
that
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
morales
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
argue
--
you
haven't
yet,
that
one
--
the
police
may
detain
for
questioning
on
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
police
may
detain
for
questioning
on
reasonable
suspicion
and
without
probable
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
don't
you
have
--
its
your
problem?
you
have
the
show
of
a
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
if
they
could
have
any
questions,
fingerprinting
and
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bessler,
can
i
just
ask
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
therefore
interpret
the
rule
as
one
that
relates
only
to
bringing
a
suspect
in
for
questioning
and
does
not
extend
to
bringing
him
in
for
a
lineup
or
for
fingerprinting?
or
is
the
court
just
not
passed
on
the
lineup
and
fingerprinting
type
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
that
--
then
i
take
it
under
the
morales
case,
if
you
had
the
facts
as
in
terry,
the
police
could
not
only
have
stopped
the
gentleman
for
a
brief
--
they
could've
taken
him
down
to
the
station
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
then?
