we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
dunaway
against
new
york.
mr.
nowak,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
--
i
think
for
the
third
time
you
called
him
an
unreliable
informant.
is
the
first
information
that
a
citizen
gives
to
police
inherently
unreliable
on
your
theory
that
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
must
he
give
several
reliable
reports
before
he
establishes
his
reliability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
inherently
unreliable
if
it's
the
first
time
the
police
hear
from
the
informant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
from
your
point
of
view,
the
results
obtained
by
the
police
validate
the
accuracy
of
the
tip
as
it
were?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
but
hypothetically,
you
said,
if
they
did
this
in
the
hypothetical
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ordinarily,
that'd
be
enough
force
to
look
like
an
arrest,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
anything
inherently
inconsistent
between
a
person
being
arrested
and
going
without
resistance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bressler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
what
difference
does
this
make?
what's
the
point
you're
making?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
really,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
there
are
3,
1
or
24?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
nowak?

justice

page

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
where
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
police
station,
i
recall,
he
drew
some
diagrams
of
the
place
where
the
crime
had
been
committed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
i
understand
you
in
your
argument
in
chief
to
concede
that
his
statements
and
the
drawing
of
the
diagram
of
the
room
were
voluntary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
back
it
up
one
stage
more,
suppose
standing
on
the
sidewalk
they
began
this
conversation
and
then
gave
him
the
miranda
warning
and
then
he
did
there
all
the
things
that
he
did
downtown,
what
would
be
your
answer
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
i
have
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
