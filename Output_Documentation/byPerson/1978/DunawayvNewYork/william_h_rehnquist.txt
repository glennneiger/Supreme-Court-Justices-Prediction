justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
the
requirement
of
corroboration
as
you
put
it
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
there
was
no
search
warrant
or
arrest
warrant
at
hand?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
were
the
appellee
and
not
the
appellant
in
the
appellant
--
appellate
division,
were
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
the
supreme
court
had
suppressed
the
confession?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
lineup
face
--
or
calling
him
in
for
a
lineup
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
but
not
on
probable
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but,
you
see,
you
can
just
bring
him
down
but
supposing
he
doesn't
want
to
come?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
suppose
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
justice
stevens
says
suppose
the
victim
is
somewhat
fugacious
as
the
number
of
these
--
rather
the
suspect
is.he
isn't
going
to
show
up
regularly
at
any
one
place.
