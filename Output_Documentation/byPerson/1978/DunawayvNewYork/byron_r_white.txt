justice

well
didn't
the
state
courts
agree
in
their
final
judgment
there
was
a
detention?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
his
will.
justice
byron

well,
it
said,
it
was

of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
says
that
this
case
involves
a
brief
detention.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
says
that
--
and
that
therefore
is
controlled
by
morales.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
did
involve
a
detention?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
admittedly
on
less
than
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
nobody
found
that
he
came
voluntarily.
no
court
found
that
he
came
voluntarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
--
the
trial
court
found
just
to
the
contrary.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
he
said,
to
retry
the
facts
here
i
think
you
ought
to
get
to
the
law
on
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
for
a
fingerprinting.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
the
--
when
these
police
acted,
morales
was
on
the
books
in
that
circuit,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
what
would
reasonable
police
people
think
about
morales?
this
court
--
this
--
the
new
york
courts
thought
this
case
was
governed
by
morales,
the
court
--
the
appellate
division
did,
they
thought
it
was
a
law
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
police
operating
under
judgments
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
morales
is
just
a
--
i
suppose,
just
a
construction
of
the
new
york
statute
to
the
powers
of
the
police?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
it
is
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
do
you
think
--
well,
police
don't
expect
you
to
(inaudible)
dicta
in
holding,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
police
said
to
themselves,
“we
don't
have
probable
cause
and
we
don't
need,
and
whether
we
need
it
or
not
we're
taking
the
fellow
down
to
the
precinct.”
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
court
in
alternative
holdings,
they're
both
holdings.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
suggesting
the
interview
is
not
an
exploitation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he
was
seized
--
he
was
--
we're
assuming
he's
being
illegally
held
in
that
room.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
suggesting
that
--
oh,
i
guess
you
are
that
questioning
him
while
he's
being
illegally
held
is
not
an
exploitation
of
the
illegality?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
page
125
says,
“we
believe
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
recent
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
morales.”
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
the
court
rearticulated
its
view
that
you
can
arrest
on
--
you
may
detain
on
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
way
they
disposed
of
the
case,
and
that's
why
they
said,
the
detention
was
legal.
justice
byron
r.
white
say
you
have
reasonable
suspicion
may
you
bring
a
person
in
against
his
will
for
fingerprinting?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
you
get
a
warrant
on
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
supreme
--
your
court
of
appeals
thinks
a
person
should
be
able
to
be,
then
you
think
that
it
should
be
able
to
be
briefly
detained
for
certain
purposes
on
less
than
probable
cause
merely
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
there's
reasonable
--
where
there's
some
suspicion
that
the
person
they're
detaining
is
involved
in
the
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
a
witness
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
they
don't
suspect
him
of
being
witness
at
all
but
just
knowing
something
about
it
--
i
mean
suspect
him
of
being
the
criminal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
case,
where
--
i
take
it,
we're
on
the
--
we
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
not
probable
cause
to
believe
that
dunaway
was
involved
in
the
crime,
or
that
he
knew
anything
about
it,
probable
cause,
there
was
less
than
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
your
view
on
these
facts?
suppose
the
police
had
been
carefully
briefed
on
morales
and
that
their
police
procedures
were
keyed
to
morales
and
that
was
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
never
been
overruled
but
then
the
case
comes
up
here
and
the
morales
is
overturned.
what
about
procedures
that
have
been
carried
on
under
morales
prior
of
the
overturning?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
difference
between
that
situation
and
when
they're
acting
under
a
statute
that
is
presumably
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event
this
particular
kind
of
argument,
i
take
it,
it
wasn't
made
in
the
state
court?
