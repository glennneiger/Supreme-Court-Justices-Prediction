justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nowak,
i'm
sorry
to
go
back
to
the
facts,
but
there
seems
to
be
a
general
consensus
that
there
was
no
change
in
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge,
but
the
--
on
page
126,
the
appellate
division
said,
“this
testimony
shows
that
the
police
illegally
detained
the
defendant
for
questioning.”
and
then
at
the
top
of
page
127
they
say,
“in
our
opinion,
the
police
conduct
here
is
proper.”
so
isn't
it
rather
clear
that
you
are
correct
in
saying
that
they
did
find
that
there
was
a
voluntary
submission
to
the
police?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
reason
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nowak
excuse
me
again,
but
you're
involved
--
arguing
the
attenuation
point
now
if
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
because
there's
an
intermediate
point
and
the
legal
proposition
i
have
--
had
disputed
is
whether
or
not
a
--
the
police
can
ever
bring
a
man
in
on
--
just
on
reasonable
suspicion.
is
it
your
view
that
it
can
never
be
done,
say,
to
fingerprint
him,
to
put
him
on
lineup,
ask
him
questions,
“is
there
any
time
when
a
suspect
against
to
him
there's
no
probable
cause
but
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
can
be
detained?
what
is
your
view
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
fingerprinting
or
for
a
lineup?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
says
no,
you
always
have
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
a
case
which
says
no,
and
they
say
no,
we're
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
we're
saying
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
for
a
lineup
as
well
as
questioning
in
review
of
your
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nowak,
on
the
attenuation
point,
what
is
the
ultimate
conclusion
one
draws
if
one
finds
there
was
attenuation?
is
it
a
conclusion
that
the
confession
was
voluntary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
it
that
attenuate
--
i
don't
--
i
have
to
confess,
what
is
it
that
--
when
he
is
trying
to
find
out
by
asking
whether
there
was
attenuation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
attenuation
--
if
at
attenuation
like
an
adjective,
what
--
if
it
is
attenuated
then
what
--
i
mean,
is
that
mean
if
it's
attenuated
then
it's
admissible
or
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
is
--
what
are
you
looking
for
when
you
ask
about
attenuation?
what
kind
of
conclusion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
found
it
was
voluntary,
haven't
you
found
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
two
kinds
of
voluntariness,
apparently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
makes
it
disconnected
other
than
voluntariness,
i
just
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
authority
for
your
theory
other
than
the
brown
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
--
the
wong
sun,
i
should
have
reread
it
i
suppose.
does
that
hold
that
there
can
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
without
being
a
violation
of
the
fifth
and
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
oral
confession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
it's
the
fruit,
the
fruit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bressler,
is
it
really
that
clear
because
wasn't
the
motion
to
make
it
exclusively
on
the
law,
so
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
the
decision
was
a
mixed
law
and
fact
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
on
the
mixed
law
and
fact
conclusion
it
is
that
the
police
conduct
here
is
proper
under
morales.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
under
morales
it's
proper
to
arrest
on
reasonable
suspicion
for
questioning.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nowak,
one
small
question.
you
would
take
the
same
position,
i
take
it,
if
they
just
asked
him
to
get
in
the
police
car
and
he
--
they
made
him
get
in
the
police
car
and
they'd
question
him
right
there,
that
would
be
the
same
issue,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
would
take
--
let
me
get
the
statement
of
course
in
the
car,
it
would
still
be
the
same
sequence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
