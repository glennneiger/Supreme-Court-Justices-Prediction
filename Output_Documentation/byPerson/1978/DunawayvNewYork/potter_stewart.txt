where
was
the
--
where
did
the
interrogation
of
cole
take
place?
justice
potter
stewart
where
he
was
incarcerated
on
another
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
already
in
jail
on
some
other
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
wasn't
brought
to
the
jail
for
interrogation?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
draper
case.
but
are
we
--
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
quite
mistaken
in
my
apprehension
that
there's
no
issue
of
whether
there
was
or
was
not
probable
cause
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
case
that
everybody
agrees
there
was
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
state
actually
concedes
it.
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
they
raise
--
there
was
not
mind-run
probable
cause,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
it
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
you
find
this
voluntary
in
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
no
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
well
i'm
just
reading
the
opinion
now
by
judge
moore
(ph)
how
do
you
pronounce
his
name?
justice
potter
stewart
he
says
that
“according
to
the
police
testimony,
defendant
was
asked
to
come
downtown
to
talk
and
that's
voluntarily.”
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
in
fact
that
he
did
come
down
voluntarily?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
a
finding
was
otherwise,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
--
there's
no
--
the
finding
was
otherwise.
justice
potter
stewart
well
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
say
anything
about
arrest,
it
talks
about
seizure.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
real
question,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
not
seized
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
pretty
clear
that
you're
not
seized
if
you
consent
to
go
along
with
somebody.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
a
seizure.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
it
doesn't
consent.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
consenting
to
the
police
authority
of
saying,
“we're
going
to
go
downtown.”
and
you
asked
them
why
you
have
to
go,
it's
obviously
you
don't
have
to
resist
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
judge
denman's
concurring
opinion
did
rely
precisely
on
the
point
implicitly
suggested
by
my
brother
white's
question,
didn't
he,
judge
denman?
justice
potter
stewart
she?
justice
potter
stewart
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
morales,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
claim
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
fact
was
involuntary.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
it,
that's
it.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
freewill
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
you
said,
that's
conceded
that
this
was
a
voluntary
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
the
attenuation
as
i
understand
it
and
perhaps
i
misunderstand
it
is
whether
or
not
its
sufficiently
disconnected
with
the
fourth
amendment
violation
by
the
police.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
wong
sun.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
argue
in
morales
only
insofar
as
you
were
saying
this
was
legal
under
morales?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
on
what
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
he
consented.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
part
of
the
opinion
do
you
rely
upon
it?
justice
potter
stewart
page
124
of
the
appendix,
i
think,
the
opinion
you're
referring
to.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
the
--
again
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
say
a
word
about
arrest.
we're
talking
about
seizing
him
and
detaining
him.
justice
potter
stewart
because
maybe
then
there
would
be
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
question
about
--
where
your
fourth
amendment
rights
are
protected,
that's
a
whole
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
how
was
it
--
wasn't
that
theory
is
completely
rejected
in
almeida-sanchez?
justice
potter
stewart
completely,
there's
a
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
was
a
statute
that
expressly
allowed
the
search
of
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
he'd
