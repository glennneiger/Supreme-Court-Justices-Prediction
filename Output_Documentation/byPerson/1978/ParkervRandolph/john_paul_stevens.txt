justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
state's
position
on
redaction?
somewhere
in
the
briefs,
i
had
the
impression
the
state
conceded
the
redaction
was
not
effectives,
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
--
so
it
isn't
a
question
of
erroneous
redaction
where
some
words
that
should
have
gone
off
or
left
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
terry,
are
you
basically
making
a
harmless
error
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reason
i'm
asking.
supposing
one
of
these
confessions
had
been
very,
very
brief
and
really
didn't
--
didn't
--
wasn't
enough
to
cast
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
him
or
just
some
kind
of
an
inculpatory
statement
attended
to
hurt
him
in
the
trial.
would
he
be
disabled
from
making
a
bruton
objection
if
he
didn't
have
enough
--
if
--
if
there
were
not
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
apart
from
the
other
confessions?
now,
as
a
--
you
are
--
as
a
matter
of
law
that
whenever
you
confess
here.
you
don't
have
the
bruton
objection
or
you
argue
in
this
case
it's
harmless
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
is
it
because
the
--
each
defendant
confessed
or
because
the
confession
of
each
defendant
was
very,
very
probative
against
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
make
the
same
argument
even
if
you
didn't
have
--
what's
the
other
wood
--
if
you
didn't
have
a
confession
from
robert
wood
and
if
you
didn't
have
a
lot
of
detail
in
each
of
confession
--
in
--
just
say
--
say
that
for
example,
pickens
had
a
very
short
confession
in
which
he
just
said,
“well,
i
met
with
these
people
but
then
i
went
home.”
he
didn't
really
say
for
that.
and
that's
all
he
confessed
to.
would
he
be
disqualified
from
raising
the
bruton
objection?
and
you
don't
have
a
wood's
confession
in
there.
on
the
basically
your
proof
consist
of
the
--
what's
in
the
randolph
confession
and
the
pickens
confession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
as
a
matter
of
law,
would
he
be
able
to
make
a
bruton
con
--
bruton
objection?
he
would
have
made
a
confession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
whether
you're
making
a
legal
argument
or
factual
argument?
now,
you
make
a
very
strong
factual
argument
in
your
brief
that
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
against
each
of
these
people.
but
is
that
because
of
this
particular
record
or
because
as
a
matter
of
law.
none
of
them
has
the
right
to
make
this
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
mean
pickens,
isn't
either
one
that
didn't
get
anything
out
of
this
whole
thing.
the
others
get
$50.00
a
piece
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
got
$50.00
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
question
is
when
did
the
--
these
respondents
raised
the
miranda
issue
in
the
state
courts
and
then
one
of
the
state
courts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
it
also
raised
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know.
do
you
know
so
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
when
we
granted
certiorari.
we
did
not
grant
certiorari
under
miranda
issue
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
evans
--
isn't
his
argument
if
i
understood
it
correctly
that
some
confessions
are
more
probative
than
others.
and
one
factor
that
tends
to
make
a
jury
sometimes
disbelieve
a
confession
is
if
they
think
that
there
was
some
brutality
attached
to
coercing
the
conviction.
but
and
i
think
his
argument
is
that
arguably
this
confession
should
not
be
--
would
not
have
not
been
taken
it
face
value
if
it
stood
alone.
but
it
was
much
more
likely
to
believe
when
there
were
three
or
four
confessions
on
the
same
offer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
a
valid
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
did
argue
did
he
not
that
the
confessions
were
not
voluntary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
close
to
the
–
at
this
point
it
goes
to
the
quality
of
that
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
they
did
not
have
--
they
did
not
again
have
a
chance
to
pass
on
voluntary?
