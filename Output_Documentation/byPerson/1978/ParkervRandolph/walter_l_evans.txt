mr.
walter
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
yes,
if
your
honor
please.
on
the
one
hand
and
no
in
the
other
for
purposes
of
clearing
the
error
as
far
as
the
bruton
rule
is
concerned,
i
think
that
the
court
should
consider
the
whole
picture
of
all
the
confessions.
but
we
would
contend
that
the
finding
below
that
the
pickens'
confession
was
inadmissible
because
of
violation
of
rule
of
miranda.
the
constitution
file
adjudication
on
that
issue
and
his
confession
should
be
or
his
conviction
should
be
reversed
on
that
reason
--
for
that
reason
alone.
but
in
considering
the
whole
bruton
issue
and
the
question
of
harmless
error,
i
think
that
it
would
be
good
to
consider
pickens'
confession
along
with
the
other
three
and
this
would
support
our
contention
that
all
three
of
these
defendants
including
pickens
would
not
the
right
to
confrontation
and
cross-examination
based
upon
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
u.s.
constitution
and
the
past
decision
of
this
court
was
has
been
rendered
since
the
bruton
rule.
now,
the
first
issue
involved
in
the
matter
of
coming
up
from
the
sixth
circuit
was
that
involving
the
interpretation
of
bruton,
schneble,
and
harrington.
we
maintain
in
our
original
response
file
in
our
position
to
the
state's
petition
that
the
state
has
erroneously
characterized
the
facts
of
this
case
to
schneble
and
harrington,
and
more
or
less
overlooked
the
significance
of
the
bruton
rule.
if
you
would
notice
in
their
briefs,
they
discount
the
importance
of
bruton.
i
think
that
in
every
decision
of
this
court
has
some
constitutional
significance
and
bruton
certainly
stands
as
a
landmark
on
the
question
of
violation
of
right
to
a
confrontation
and
right
to
a
cross-examination.
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
stated
and
davis
versus
alaska,
and
also
this
court
in
pointer
v.
texas
and
douglas
versus
alabama
that
the
right
to
cross-examination
is
very
much
apart
of
the
right
of
confrontation
as
stated
in
our
sixth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
this
case
in
our
opinion
will
present
somewhat
of
a
precedent
in
the
sense
it
would
clear
the
air
on
the
question
of
harmless
error.
the
cases
of
harrington
and
schneble
did
not
overrule
bruton
which
mr.
justice
brennan
wrote
his
rare
reason
argument
on.
this
case
is
a
case
as
mr.
justice
stevens
indicated
involving
the
question
of
harmless
error.
now,
we
talk
about
harmless
error.
we
must
look
at
chapman
v.
california,
fahy
versus
connecticut,
schneble
v.
florida,
harrington
v.
california,
and
the
court
has
consistently
stated
that
harmless
error
means
harmless
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
it
is
the
federal
standard
which
this
court
should
consider
as
indicated
in
the
case
of
fahy
versus
connecticut.
now,
the
crucial
facts
of
this
case
as
they
relate
to
the
respondent's
convictions
are
probably
to
two
basic
theories.
the
one
promoted
by
the
state
and
the
theory
of
possible
theories
supported
by
us
in
our
brief.
and
the
state
has
made
a
sum
conclusory
statements
throughout
these
proceedings
which
have
indicated
the
facts
of
this
case
show
very
clearly
that
these
respondents
were
part
of
the
plan
to
rob.
but
a
close
examination
and
the
view
of
the
record
in
our
opinion
could
lead
this
court
to
conclude
to
the
contrary
are
certain
that
lead
this
court
to
conclude
that
the
facts
are
not
clear
as
to
the
respondents'
involvement
in
these
whole
proceeding.
now,
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
purposes
of
ruling
on
bruton
accepted
the
theory
most
favorable
to
the
state
on
the
question
of
the
respondents'
involvement
in
these
whole
proceedings.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
no,
there
is
no
question
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
as
to
the
wood
involvement.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
in
fact,
we
contend
that
the
wood
brothers
possibly
along
with
tommy
thomas,
the
supposedly
impartial
observer
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
right.
that
the
three
--
the
two
or
maybe
three
of
them
concocted
the
plan
to
and
we
deny
that
there
was
even
in
the
plan
to
rob
the
poker
game.
this
is
a
theory
promoted
by
the
state.
but
a
close
reading
of
the
record
that
even
a
close
examination
of
robert
wood's
testimony,
of
course
the
state
relies
upon
so
heavily,
does
not
really
support
the
theory
in
our
contention
about
a
plan
to
rob?
mr.
walter
l.
evans
if
you
would
--
if
the
court
would
examine
the
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
that
is
not
the
evidence,
if
your
honor
please.
the
evidence
shows
that
robert
wood
took
all
the
money
off
the
table.
some
of
which
was
his
own.
in
fact
the
theory
of
the
robbery
is
contained
in
the
latter
part
of
robert
wood
statement
where
he
stated
that,
“if
i
caught
the
game
of
cheating,
then
i
may
--
i
was
going
to
ask
for
my
money
back.”
he
didn't
say
he
was
going
to
get
any
of
the
victim's
money.
he
says,
i'm
going
to
ask
for
my
money
back,
if
i
caught
him
cheating.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
well,
it's
a
--
mr.
justice
stewart
if
would
consider
the
confession
of
the
statement,
the
all
statement
of
hamilton
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
--
which
was
presented
to
the
jury.
a
reasonable
conclusion
could
be
drawn
that
hamilton
worked
for
joe
wood.
he
was
asked
to
bring
a
couple
or
bring
some
of
his
friends
by
this
particular
apartment.
he
may
not
have
even
indicated
the
purpose
of
their
coming
back.
but
assuming
he
indicated
that
my
brother
was
involved
in
the
poker
game
and
that
he
felt
that
this
other
fellow
was
cheating
him,
and
he
might
just
need
some
physical
bodies
present
when
we
asked
for
his
money
back.
and
this
why
they
went
there
because
his
boss
had
told
him
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
--
“i
want
you
to
come
and
may
you
bring
some
of
your
friends.”
but
we
deny
and
the
record
would
support
our
contention
that
these
three
respondents
possibly
did
not
even
have
any
weapons.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
and
the
--
the
entire
episode
carries
a
very
interesting
scenario
and
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
--
the
evidence
that
was
presented.
if
you
really
examine
the
evidence
presented
before
the
jury
and
the
state's
theory
is
contained
to
a
great
extent
of
justice
stevens'
in
that
evidence
which
was
not
admitted
into
evidence
before
the
jury.
and
one
of
the
questions
of
harmless
error,
the
court
must
consider
what
evidence
was
presented
before
the
jury.
there
were
the
facts
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
yes,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
involved
in
the
harrington
case.
harrington
the
specific
issue
in
the
harrington
and
schneble
assumed
a
violation
of
bruton.
and
the
question
was,
was
there
harmless
error
in
those
cases?
in
this
particular
case,
the
first
issue
or
the
only
issue
before
the
court
as
framed
by
the
state
is
whether
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
has
correctly
interpreted
the
law
as
stated
by
this
court
in
bruton
versus
united
states,
schneble
v.
florida,
and
harrington
versus
california.
so,
harrington
and
schneble
were
cases
dealing
specifically
with
or
deal
only
with
the
question
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
bruton
stood
for
the
proposition
that
the
admission
into
evidence
of
statements
of
co-defendants
which
implicate
each
other
and
where
these
co-defendants
do
not
take
the
stand
to
testify
and
be
available
for
cross-examination
violates
the
co-defendants
right
to
confrontation
and
cross-examination.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
the
only
ones
who
did
not
confess
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
all
confessed
except
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
--
in
our
opinion
the
crucial
man.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
joe
wood
was
the
link
between
these
three
respondents
and
the
one
who
actually
fired
the
fatal
blow.
now,
there
are
certain
facts
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
--
there
are
certain
facts
in
this
case
that
are
undisputed
without
any
question.
number
one,
robert
wood
was
the
person
who
fired
the
fatal
shot.
the
state
does
not
contend
to
the
contrary.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
yes.
he
was
the
card
player.
secondly,
neither
of
these
respondents
participated
in
the
game
nor
had
they
been
in
the
room
at
anytime
prior
to
the
shooting.
the
state
does
not
contend
to
the
contrary.
neither
of
these
respondents
took
any
money
from
the
game
at
all.
in
their
brief
in
fact
they
had
--
they
state
that
robert
wood
took
all
of
the
money.
well,
a
closer
reading
of
the
record,
in
the
case
that
he
took
some
money
from
the
table
and
stuffed
it
in
his
pocket.
another
theory
might
be
tommy
thomas
took
the
rest
after
everybody
had
left.
but
nevertheless
the
state
admits
that
robert
wood
took
all
the
money
on
the
table
and
stuffed
it
in
his
pocket.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
right.
some
of
these
considered
rightfully
his.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
no,
but
these
respondents
were
convicted
of
murder
in
the
perpetration
of
a
robbery.
and
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
forcible
taking.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
if
there
was
an
attempt
which
was
not
consummated,
i
believe
and
you
can
correct
me
that
that
would
be
an
offense
of
attempted
robbery.
but
in
this
case
they
were
charged
with
murder
in
effect
during
a
robbery.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
oh,
i
understand
--
we
will
not
--
we
will
not
go
there
far
if
you
please
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
saying
that
the
robbery
had
to
be
consummated
at
the
time
of
the
murder
in
order
for
that
to
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
but
what
we
would
say
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
murder,
there
had
been
no
attempted
robbery.
and
the
murder
took
place
and
if
you
would
read
these
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
is
has
a
very
interesting
analysis
of
the
felony
murder
doctrine.
the
murder
took
place
before,
before
any
attempted
robbery
if
there
was
in
fact
a
robbery
and
before
these
three
respondents
came
into
the
room,
if
they
came
into
the
room.
now
the
state
contends
of
the
theory
of
harmless
error
that
there
is
other
evidence
in
the
record
of
placing
these
particular
respondents
at
the
scene
of
the
robbery
or
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
assuming
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
who
is
that?
mr.
walter
l.
evans
but
if
the
court
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
not
--
not
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
no,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
did
--
the
testimony
was
assumed
that
they
were
there
and
the
record
will
show
that
three
out
robert
wood's
testimony.
when
he
was
asked
directly
whether
these
respondents,
where
those
three
blacks
who
came
into
the
room
after
the
robbery,
his
statements
were
specifically,
“i
assume
they
were
because
i
met
them
for
a
second
after
the
robbery.”
mr.
walter
l.
evans
no,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
i
--
he
-
he
did
not
testify
that
they
were
there.
he
testified
--
i
assume
that
they
were
there
which
in
our
opinion
is
far
different.
he
did
not
positively
identify
these
three
respondents
as
those
three
blacks
who
came
into
the
room
after
the
murder
was
committed.
but
assuming
he
did.
the
--
the
only
evidence
that
would
be
presented
at
that
point
is
that
these
defendants
came
into
a
room
after
a
murder.
but
in
order
to
convict
them
of
murder
in
a
perpetuates
of
a
robbery,
where
it
is
quite
clear
that
they
did
not
do
the
shooting
and
they
did
not
even
do
the
robbery.
there
must
be
a
link
and
a
plan,
and
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
considered
in
reversing
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
court
of
supreme
court
of
tennessee
felt
that
they
will
nevertheless
a
part
of
the
plan
to
rob.
and
as
our
contention
that
this
part
--
this
plan
in
only
contained
in
the
confessions
of
these
three
respondents
and
a
close
examination
of
the
record
would
present
serious
questions
even
considering
all
the
evidence
of
this
court
is
not
considering
you
know,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
but
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
if
your
honor
please,
we
would
like
for
this
court
to
support
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
tennessee
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
tennessee
and
the
sixth
circuit
puts
all
three
of
these
courts
in
reviewing
the
whole
record.
not
only
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
we
are
not
seeking
to
a
request
of
this
court
to
make
any
drastic
in
rules
into
the
law.
we're
not
seeking
to
overrule
any
of
this
court's
past
decisions
since
bruton.
we
are
merely
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
three
courts.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
i'm
sorry.
one
court
if
your
honor
please.
that's
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
no,
i
was
not
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
the
--
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
dealt
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
conviction
on
felony
murder
or
murder
in
the
perpetration
of
robbery
in
the
bruton
rule.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
right
mr.
walter
l.
evans
no.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
--
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
i
believe
it
was,
if
your
honor
please,
but
the
court
did
not
address
itself
to
those
issue.
it
disposed
of
the
case
on
bruton
and
also
on
the
sufficiency
of
felony
murder
rule
as
i
recall
the
record.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
well,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
felt
that
the
reversal
on
the
grounds
of
insufficiency
of
the
felony
murder
and
bruton
was
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
so
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
only
dealt
with
those
two
issues
presented
in
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
the
miranda
issue
as
i
recall
was
not
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
it
would
not
have
been.
if
your
honor
please.
it
would
not
have
been
considered
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
because
the
court
of
--
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
address
itself
to
that
issue.
and
the
tennessee
court
of
--
the
supreme
court,
merely
address
itself
to
those
issues
contained
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decision.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
it
was
raised
initially
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
i
believe
so
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
it
was
raised
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
that
the
records
are
pretty
faked
and
i
came
in
at
the
district
court,
u.s.
district
court
level.
and
in
trying
to
review
the
entire
record
below,
it
did
appear
that
the
issue
was
raised
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
the
respondents
appeal
that
conviction
from
--
on
the
trial
court
decision
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeal.

after

reversed
all
the

appeal

mr.

those

mr.

your

it
was

mr.

that
is
correct.
mr.

the

if
we

lost
--
mr.

no,
they
really
--
respondents
did
not
have
to
present
or
raise
a
new
issue
before
this
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
right.
the
state
was
one
who
appeal
to
the
state
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
i
was
in
the
district
court--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
right,
in
the
habeas
--
mr.
walter

evans
not
on
--
mr.
walter

evans
not
on
these
issues,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
yes,
if
your
honor
please.
the
district
court
denied
in
a
pretrial
order
certain
issues
raised
by
the
respondents
because
they
have
not
been
exhausted
in
the
court
below.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
they
did
not.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
right.
for
whatever
reason,
the
court
did
not
address
that
issue.
we
can
only
speculate
because
it
was
not
raised
in
the
state's
petition
for
appeal
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
the
issue
that
was
before
this
court
is
whether
the
bruton
rule
was
violated
and
more
importantly
in
our
position
or
opinion.
whether
the
violation
of
the
bruton
rule
was
harmless
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
in
considering
the
question
of
harmless
error,
the
evidence
presented
before
the
court
is
very
much
important.
the
only
evidence
introduced
were
the
testimonies
of
five
supposedly
impartial
witnesses
whose
only
test
among
was
limited
to
their
statements
that
they
saw
three
blacks
outside
the
door
of
the
apartment.
one
witness
says
they
saw
two
blacks
coming
outside.
another
with
two
witnesses
said,
a
white
and
three
blacks
but
no
way
in
the
record
could
we
find
any
testimony
of
these
supposed
impartial
witnesses
that
these
respondents
had
any
weapons
in
their
hands
that
they
did
anything
of
then
either
appear
at
the
door
and/or
kicked
the
door
in.
the
crucial
testimony
in
this
case
comes
from
robert
wood,
who
gave
an
initial
statement
to
the
police
before
his
indictment.
in
which
he
stated
very
clearly,
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
identify
these
blacks
that
came
in
and
consistent
with
the
original
plan
of
robert
wood,
joe
wood
and
tommy
thomas
to
place
all
the
blame
on
three
unidentified
blacks.
and
the
record
will
show
in
reading
the
statements
of
tommy
thomas
and
also
of
robert
wood
that
joe
wood,
robert
wood
and
tommy
thomas
met
after
this
incident
to
concoct
the
plan.
to
put
this
whole
murder
on
three
unidentified
blacks
who
supposedly
came
into
the
room,
shot
the
victim,
and
left
with
all
the
money.
but
after
some
investigation
apparently
the
police
did
not
believe
that
version
and
subsequently,
indicted
the
wood
brothers
along
with
three
respondents.
now
i
think
that
in
considering
the
question
of
harmless
error,
the
court
cannot
turn
his
head
to
the
complaint
of
coercion
and
as
the
sixth
circuit
said,
that
was
a
very
vivid
complaint
of
coercion
and
physical
abuse
as
it
relates
to
these
three
confessions.
and
it
would
be
our
contention
that
this
--
the
existence
of
this
kind
of
abuse,
a
word
create
a
sort
of
tainted
character
to
these
confessions
and
we're
not
dealing
with
unchallenged
confessions.
we're
not
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
it
--
in
considering
the
tainted
evidence
against
the
untainted
evidence.
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
brennan
in
harrington
raised
the
question
about
in
weighing
the
harmless
--
in
fact
in
weighing
harmless
error,
you
must
consider
the
quality
of
the
evidence
of
both
sides,
the
quality
of
the
untainted
evidence,
the
quality
of
the
tainted
and
it's
our
position
that
there
is
very
little
untainted
evidence
in
this
case.
if
there's
any
untainted
evidence,
it
would
be
the
testimony
of
the
five
witnesses
outside
the
apartment
who
could
not
identify
either
of
these
three
respondents
as
the
three
blacks
or
the
three
negroes
or
the
three
colored
men
who
are
at
the
door.
and
the
testimony
of
robert
wood
is
tainted.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
the
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
the
--
the
--
as
i
read
the
record,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
walter
l.
evans
as
i
read
the
record
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
witnesses
merely
testified
to
what
they
observed
outside
the
apartment.
they
did
not
go
inside
the
apartment.
mr.
walter
l.
evans
of
which
three
are
you
referring
to?
mr.
walter
l.
evans
the
state
contends
they
went
in
and
of
course
the
court
could
--
couldn't
possibly
conclude
that
they
did
or
some
of
them
did
go
into
the
apartment.
but
the
testimony
of
the
confession
of
hamilton
which
was
admitted
before
the
court
until
--
it
shows
that
he
did
not
go
into
the
apartment.
and
that
this
consists
of
what
the
respondent's
theory
that
once
the
door
was
kicked
in
primarily
by
joe
wood.
they
looked
inside
the
door
and
saw
a
white
figure
lying
on
the
floor.
they
turned
and
went
away.
but
because
tommy
thomas,
and
robert
wood,
and
joe
wood
had
concocted
this
theory
about
the
blacks'
involvement,
in
order
to
maintain
some
credibility
at
court,
it's
our
contention
that
robert
wood,
tommy
thomas
consisted
to
maintain
that
these
blacks
did
in
fact
come
into
the
apartment
and
they
in
fact
fired
some
shots
and
robbed
him
and
so
forth.
but
the
record
it
very
clear
that
the
evidence
of
these
three
respondents
involvement
is
very
shady
and
that
without
these
confessions.
there's
no
reasonable
way
these
respondents
could
have
been
convicted
of
murder
in
the
perpetuation
of
a
robbery.
