mr.
michael
e.
terry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
which
i
have
the
privilege
of
presenting
to
this
court
began
in
memphis,
tennessee
in
1970.
as
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
states,
“this
matter
involves
a
sequence
of
events
which
have
the
flavor
of
the
old
west
before
the
law
crossed
the
pecos.
the
difference
is
that
here,
as
the
sixth
circuit
stated
there
are
no
real
heroes
and
there
was
a
trial.”
it
seems
that
in
july
of
1970,
a
las
vegas
gambler
by
the
name
of
william
douglas
came
to
memphis
with
a
gun,
an
alias,
and
a
device
for
marking
cards.
douglas
sought
through
some
local
connections
in
memphis,
a
card
game.
he
was
introduced
eventually
to
a
memphis
gambler
by
the
name
of
robert
wood.
wood
apparently
felt
that
through
his
skill
at
poker
he
would
be
relieved
douglas
of
his
money.
however,
douglas
opted
for
the
advantages
of
marking
the
cards
rather
than
the
uncertainties
of
skill
and
in
three
head
to
head
matches
he
relieved
wood,
robert
wood,
of
approximately
$5,000.00.
and
wood
apparently
had
some
confidence
in
himself
and
in
his
game
because
he
didn't
blame
the
losses
on
his
own
incompetence
and
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
being
cheated.
he
became
convinced
that
he
was
being
cheated
and
together
with
his
brother,
joe
wood,
had
formed
a
plan
to
recoup
his
losses.
that
plan
involved
using
joe
wood
and
three
respondents
in
this
matter
to
rob
a
fourth
poker
game
between
mr.
douglas
and
robert
wood.
thus,
robert
wood's
plan
in
a
nutshell
was
to
recoup
his
gambling
losses
by
the
robbery
proceeds.
prior
to
the
night
of
the
fourth
game,
mr.
joe
wood,
his
brother
and
two
of
the
respondents
here,
hamilton
and
pickens,
went
to
the
scene
of
the
fourth
game,
looked
it
over,
plan
their
strategy
and
according
to
the
evidence
there
was
some
discussion
on
how
the
proceeds
would
be
split.
on
that
night
of
the
game,
there
were
four
people
in
the
room
when
the
game
began,
robert
wood,
joe
wood,
mr.
douglas,
and
an
individual,
by
the
name
tommy
thomas,
who
said
to
be
a
mutual
acquaintance
of
douglas
and
robert
wood.
about
9
o'clock
of
that
evening,
joe
wood
began
to
unfold
the
robbery
plan.
he
got
up
and
said
he
was
going
to
the
store
to
buy
some
beer.
he
went
outside
and
he
met
with
the
three
respondents.
they
did
go
to
the
store.
they
did
buy
some
beer
but
apparently
they
station
their
cars
some
place
suitable
to
their
plan.
and
they
approach
the
apartment
together
and
mr.
douglas
became
suspicious.
he
heard
noise
outside.
he
armed
himself
with
a
shotgun.
now
joe
wood
removed
the
three
respondents
from
right
outside
the
door
of
the
apartment.
before
douglas
could
see
him
and
he
was
allowed
to
crawl
backed
into
the
apartment
while
being
watched
with
douglas
who
was
on
with
a
shotgun.
once
joe
wood
was
back
inside,
the
game
continued.
the
three
respondents
were
outside.
joe
wood
then,
short
time
later
telling
the
people
inside
that
he
had
to
use
the
bathroom,
entered
the
bathroom
of
the
apartment
and
came
out
armed
with
a
gun.
he
apparently
was
a
little
nervous
at
that
time
because
he
gave
the
gun
to
his
brother,
robert
wood,
who
was
seated
at
the
table
playing
cards
with
douglas
and
joe
wood
left
leaving
the
door
to
the
apartment
open.
tommy
thomas
at
that
time
was
lying
on
floor.
he
got
up,
closed
the
door
and
attempted
to
mediate
between
douglas
and
robert
wood.
as
the
evidence
shows,
douglas
apparently
reached
for
a
gun
that
was
in
his
belt
at
that
time
and
robert
wood
killed
by
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
this
was
in
an
apartment
house
in
memphis.
it
was
in
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes,
sir.
within
seconds
from
the
shot
that
eventually
killed
mr.
douglas.
the
door
flew
open
and
the
three
respondents
came
running
in
to
carry
out
their
plan
of
robbery.
they
fired
two
shots
within
the
apartment.
rob
thomas
of
some
$50.00
to
$80.00,
took
the
proceeds
off
the
table,
took
a
knife
and
then
the
five
eventual
defendants
in
this
case,
the
two
wood
brothers
and
the
three
respondents
here,
hamilton,
pickens,
and
randolph
left.
subsequently,
they
went
from
there
according
to
the
evidence
over
the
hamilton's
apartment
where
they
hid
the
weapons,
divided
up
the
money
and
went
there
separate
ways.
douglas
of
course
died.
subsequently,
they
were
all
either
arrested
or
they
turned
themselves
within
to
the
memphis
police
department.
prior
to
their
trial,
four
of
these
individuals
gave
statements
to
the
memphis
police
department.
joe
wood
never
gave
a
statement
and
he
did
not
testify
at
trial.
robert
wood
gave
a
detailed
lengthy
statement
that
was
later
introduced
in
a
trial
in
a
redacted
form.
robert
wood
also
testified
at
trial.
mr.
hamilton
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
mr.
--
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
the
redaction
process
was
admirable.
i
do
not
concede
that
it
wasn't
effective.
what
i
--
what
i
mean
by
that
is
i
don't
think
that
redaction
when
there's
two
defendants
sitting
there
and
the
references
are
the
two
others
is
ever
a
substitution
for
cross-examination
or
confrontation.
but
i
do
think
it's
a
factor
to
be
considered
when
you
get
to
the
issue
of
the
devastating
effect
of
the
co-defendants'
statement.
in
other
words,
i
think
it's
better
in
this
case
that
there
was
an
attempted
redaction.
for
instance,
in
some
of
the
cases
here
where
this
court
has
found
harmless
error
like
schneble
and
brown.
there
was
no
redaction
so
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
no,
sir.
i
perceive
a
redaction
as
a
fact
to
be
considered
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--
in
reaching
the
--
in
reaching
the
final
question.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
there
was
five,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
they
were
charged
under
the
felony
murder
statute,
murder
and
perpetration
of
robbery.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
they
were
charged.
i
don't
believe
they
were
charge
with
armed
robbery.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i
--
i
know.
i
--
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
record
that
they
were
charged
with
murder
and
perpetuation
of
robbery
and
were
convicted
of
that
offense.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes,
your
honor.
now,
hamilton
gave
two
confessions.
one
oral
which
was
immediately
reduce
to
writing
and
admitted
in
a
redacted
form.
he
gave
--
he
went
through
a
question
and
answer
routine
with
the
police
department
that
was
transcribed
but
not
admitted.
randolph
gave
two
all
statements
was
later
admitted.
both
redacted
and
admitted.
pickens
went
through
the
same
question
and
answer,
routine
with
the
police
department.
his
question
--
the
questions
and
the
answers
were
transcribed
--
there
was
redaction
and
performed
and
there
were
admitted.
in
pickens
case,
he
signed
the
transcription
and
initialed
each
page
also.
the
redaction
process
reduced
any
references
to
the
--
to
the
other
defendants
either
eliminated
them,
deleted
them
or
changed
them
to
they
references,
two
other
party
references,
we
or
guy.
the
guy
reference
is
the
only
indication
of
the
sex
of
the
people
who
were
involved.
there
is
no
indication
of
any
other
physical
characteristics,
no
indication
of
race.
now,
it's
the
position
of
state
of
tennessee
here
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
a
sixth
amendment
question
involving
a
right
to
confrontation?
we
maintain
that
the
error
in
this
matter
below
stems
from
an
inappropriate
application
of
bruton
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
we
believe
it
is
impossible
to
draw
a
logical
analogy
between
these
facts
and
the
facts
in
the
bruton
case.
to
do
that
--
to
draw
that
analogy
ignores
some
very
real
distinctions
in
this
case
and
also
ignores
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
schneble,
harrington,
and
more
recently
in
brown.
we
think
the
most
important
distinction
between
this
case
and
bruton
is
that
in
this
case
the
parties
raising
the
bruton
objection
had
confess
themselves
that
their
confessions
are
internally
consistent,
that
they
corroborate
each
other
and
then
they
have
been
redacted.
we
think
that
this
--
these
factors
have
an
impact
--
have
an
effect
on
the
question
of
devastation.
the
question
that
concern
this
court
very
much
in
bruton.
we
think
that
the
risk
of
prejudice
to
these
people
is
eliminated
because
of
the
internal
consistency,
because
of
the
redaction.
we
think
that
the
overall
effect
of
the
confession
is
simply
cumulative.
i
think
another
important
distinction
between
this
case
and
bruton
is
a
testimony
of
robert
wood
and
the
testimony
of
tommy
thomas.
robert
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
the
problem
i
have
of
that
mr.
justice
stevens
is
--
is
starting
with
bruton
as
a
starting
point
when
you
have
more
than
one
confession
or
when
the
objector
is
also
a
confessor.
i
think
at
that
point,
you
should
go
back
to
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
question
should
be
confrontation.
and
what
does
confrontation
require
and
whether
the
remedy
has
to
be
what
occurred
in
bruton.
in
bruton,
i
think
under
the
facts
of
bruton,
george
bruton
was
convicted
on
hearsay.
there
was
very
little
else
there.
here,
that's
a
different
situation
and
that's
why,
i
don't
like
to
say
harmless
error
because
harmless
error
assumes
a
bruton
violation.
and
i
don't
think
there
was
a
bruton
violation
here.
if
there's
a
violation,
it's
a
sixth
amendment
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i
think
the
most
important
distinction
is
that
they
confessed.
they
incriminated
themselves.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
our
--
no,
i
think
that
mr.
pickens
would
be
in
much
better
situation
because
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
again
and
i,
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
appear
to
argue
with
you.
i
think
he
should
make
a
sixth
amendment
confession
because
a
sixth
amendment
objection.
a
right
to
confrontation
objection
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--
no
cross-examination.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i
am
being
convicted
on
hearsay.
he
would
be
saying.
not
bruton,
it's
just
not
bruton
because
bruton
there's
one
confession
and
it
is
in
--
and
the
person
raising
it
is
sitting
there
silently.
not
testifying
and
not
confessing.
and
i
think
that
you
have
different
situation
where
you
have
corroborative
confessions.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i
think
it's
because
of
this
particular
record
and
i
think
that
under
harmless
error.
i'm
saying
harmless
error
under
sixth
amendment.
not
harmless
error
under
bruton
and
that
that
--
i
know
its
confusing
but
i'm
not
the
only
one
confused
if
you
read
the
circuits
in
this
situation,
a
very
much
split
and
they
--
and
they
go
through
a
process
of
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
they're
saying
and
some
of
them
in
the
end
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
we're
saying.
but
i
think
the
important
thing
is
to
go
back
to
the
right
of
confrontation
and
not
stop
it
bruton.
go
all
the
way
back
and
say,
what
is
confrontation
require.
if
confrontation
requires
cross-examination,
then
and
there
is
no
cross-examination.
then
what
is
the
remedy?
in
bruton
situation,
he's
convicted
on
hearsay,
in
this
situation.
they're
not.
so
the
remedy
does
not
have
to
be
reversal.
the
remedy
here
it
can
be
affirmance,
even
if
--
even
if
you
say
that
there
is
a
technical
violation
of
a
right
to
cross-examine
that
is
secured
by
the
sixth
amendment.
there's
still
does
not
have
to
be
the
drastic
remedy
that
was
necessary
for
bruton.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
because
of
miranda.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i'll
be
less
than
candid
to
tell
you
that
we're
in
as
good
position
with
mr.
pickens
as
we
are
with
randolph
and
hamilton.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
well
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
it
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
that's
correct.
except
what
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
pickens
was
positive
--
he
was
identified
by
robert
wood.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
because
robert
wood
was
in
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
it's
not
a
bruton
situation
because
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
as
to
him
is
not
because
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
because
robert
wood
testified
at
trial
and
he
said
pickens
was
one
of
those
people
who
came
through
that
door
and
he
was
cross-examined
and
he
was
--
and
in
cross-examination,
pickens'
counsel
asked
one
question.
he
said
to
robert
wood,
“did
robert
pickens
worked
for
your
brother?”
he
never
contested
the
identification
and
robert
wood
had
just
identified
his
man
as
coming
to
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes.
and
that's
different
in
bruton.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
robert
wood.
robert
wood
testified
the
other
three
did
not
testified.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
joe
wood
did
not
either.
joe
wood,
the
reason
i'm
treating
him
different
because
he
has
made
no
statement
either.
he
just
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
he
was
co-defendant
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
no.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
no.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
posts
comes
back
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
that's
accurate.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
neither
one
testified
and
there
was
no
redaction.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
and
in
an
examination
with
this
court
found
in
rendering
the
opinion
that
evans
confessing
was
just
about
it
against
bruton.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
later
on
evans
was
--
evans'
conviction
was
reversed
because
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
right.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
correct,
before
it
got
here.
so
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
that's
correct.
and
bruton,
the
weight
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
against
bruton
was
evans'
confession
which
was
hearsay.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes,
they
had.
and
that's
–
that's
what
this
court
said.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i
don't
think
so.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
was
much
and
in
reading
this
court's
opinion.
i
think
this
court
found
that
there
wasn't
much
other
than
that.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes,
it
was.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes,
it
was.
i
think
that
if
you
go
through
the
testimony
in
this
record
other
than
the
confessions.
put
the
confession
aside
and
go
through
everything
else.
go
through
robert
wood's
testimony.
go
through
tommy
thomas'
testimony.
go
through
the
police
officers'
ballistics
report.
go
through
the
finding
of
the
weapons
at
hamilton.
at
the
end
of
that
review,
you
--
there
was
also
a
number
of
witnesses
outside
the
apartment
who
could
not
positively
identify
the
people
but
could
relate
physical
characteristics.
at
the
end
of
that
review,
there's
only
one
question
that
you
--
that
is
left
and
that
is
who
were
those
three
people
who
broke
down
that
door
and
came
in
there,
what
was
there
names?
who
were
they?
that's
only
thing
left
unanswered
by
the
competent,
admissible
evidence
in
this
record.
that
question
is
answered
by
the
people
who
broke
down
the
door
themselves.
they
came
in
then
one
by
one
and
say,
“i
did
it.
that
was
me.”
and
that's
the
only
value,
that's
the
only
value
of
their
confession.
that's
the
only
thing
that
you
get
from
there
confession
that
you
don't
already
have
and
you
sort
of
have
that,
although
you
don't
have
it
as
well
as
any
prosecutor
would
like
to
have
it
in
robert
wood's
identification
of
them.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
how
is
there
a
bruton
issue?
mr.
michael
e.
terry
well,
there
is
a
bruton
issue.
he's
here
complaining?
mr.
michael
e.
terry
he's
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
but
i'm
complaining
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
issued
because
he
has
been
successful
with
the
bruton
argument
in
the
sixth
amendment.
the
sixth
amendment
opinion
says
that
pickens'
rights
were
violated
according
to
bruton.
and
they
talked
about
miranda
in
about
two
sentences
and
i
--
and
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i
agree
with
you.
i
agree
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
no.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
no.
his
confession
has
been
struck
from
this
record
because
of
a
miranda
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
not
if
you
can
say
that
there's
still
enough
evidence
in
this
record
to
convict
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
well,
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--
i
think
that
has
been
holding
of
this
court
in
the
past.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
what
i
--
what
i
urged
with
regard
to
pickens
is
and
i
mean
to
emphasize
this.
i
don't
mean
to
give
you
the
impression
that
i
think
that
we're
as
well
off
with
regard
to
pickens
as
we
are
with
hamilton
and
randolph.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
about
the
only
thing
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
that
was
it
they
were
reversed
under
bruton
and
they
went
through
pages
and
pages
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
it
has
to
do
with
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i
know
and
i'm
not
asking
you
to
review
it.
not
again.
i
already
have
asked
you
but
i'm
not
asking
you
now?
i'm
not
asking
you
to
review
that.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
pickens
conviction
by
reading
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
reversed
for
a
violation
of
bruton
in
the
bottom
line
of
their
opinion
they
say,
we
do
not
have
to
reach
the
miranda
issue
or
discuss
it
but
we
have
looked
at
it
and
we
agree
with
the
district
court
and
that's
about
it.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
they
issue
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
in
this
case
that
meant
that
we
had
--
a
reasonable
time
to
retry
them
or
let
them
go.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
to
rebut
mr.
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i
--
i
think
the
only
place
you
can
make
that
finding
is
in
his
own
confession.
if
you
read
everybody
else's
version,
pickens
got
as
much
as
everybody
else.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
$50.00.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
he
is
the
one.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes.
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
issue
of
the
miranda,
the
rob
that
went,
it
was
considered
by
the
trial
court
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
down
in
the
states
favor
assigned
as
error
no.
5
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
by
the
defendants
considered
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
found
to
be
without
merit.
then
the
state
appealed
from
that
position
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--
and
it
wasn't
before
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
but
we
did
not
raise
exhaustion.
we
relied
on
28
--
2254
(d)
and
in
the
district
court,
we
figured
there
had
been
a
fair
hearing.
that
issue
is
not
here
but
that
is
throughout
that
it
went.
the
one
important
point
i'd
like
to
make
and
that
is
that
mr.
--
as
mr.
evans
says
“untainted
evidence”,
very
little
untainted
evidence.
it's
very
important
to
note
in
deciding
this
case
in
considering
this
record
that
each
of
these
confessions
is
untainted
evidence
as
to
the
confessor.
and
when
you
are
getting
into
a
weighing
of
the
proof
that
can
make
up
that
quantum
of
proof
necessary
to
find
harmless
error,
the
confessor's
confession
should
be
considered
against
himself.
it
is
untainted
in
that
respect.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
well
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
i
think
i
have
to
reflect
that
one.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
he
did
but
that
point
was
not
before
the
sixth
circuit.
then
it
was
not
before
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
that
issue
was
--
all
was
decided
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
it
wasn't
in
front
of
him.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
one
of
them.
the
district
court
--
it
is
not
coerced.
they
didn't
find
coerce
--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
violation
of
access
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
access
to
counsel.
i
thank
you
for
listening.
