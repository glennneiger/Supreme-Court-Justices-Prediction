justice
potter
stewart
where
was
this
in
a
private
residence
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
an
apartment,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
this
trial,
there
were
how
many
co-defendants?
justice
potter
stewart
five
co-defendants
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
charges
were
murder
and
robbery?
justice
potter
stewart
all
charged
with
murder
and
some
of
most
so
if
not
all
of
them
charged
with
robbery
as
well?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
matter
of
belief.
it's
what
happened
with
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
five
co-defendants.
justice
potter
stewart
in
one
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
which
of
these
defendants
if
any
or
maybe
all
of
them,
testified
at
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
told
us
there
were
five
co-defendants?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
was
a
co-defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
only
one
of
the
five
testified
that
it
was
robert
wood?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
bruton
case,
there
was
evans
whose
confession
was
the
critical
document
or
the
critical
fact.
i
guess
it
was
an
oral
confession
testified
to
by
some
police
with
him.
and
evans
didn't
testify
at
bruton
neither
the
co-defendants
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
testified.
justice
potter
stewart
all
i
had
was
the
confession
of
evident
--
of
evans
as
reported
by
a
third
party.
and
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
trial
court
say,
you
can't
use
that
except
against
evans
and
this
court
held
that
despite
those
instructions
that
was
so
damaging
with
respect
to
bruton
and
violated
so
greatly
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
confrontation
that
that
conviction
was
reverse,
is
that
it?
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
neither
of
them
would
testify.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
happened
before
the
case
got
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
we
must
have
bruton's
case
here.
justice
potter
stewart
although,
it
says
right
until
by
the
trial
judge
to
disregard
with
respect
to
bruton.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
judge
must
have
considered
there
was
an
evidence
other
than
that
confession
to
go
--
to
take
a
case
to
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
event
--
whether
or
not
there
might
also
be
a
bruton
issue
with
respect
to
him.
his
conviction
has
been
reversed
because
of
a
miranda
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
before
his
conviction
may
be
reversed
for
a
new
trial,
that's
generally
the
result.
justice
potter
stewart
if
a
confession
is
improperly
admitted.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
no
--
no.
that's
says
no
to
me.
if
a
confession
is
wrongfully
admitted
at
trial
against
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
regardless
of
the
error
there
or
other
evidence
that
conviction
is
reversed
for
a
new
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
many
times?
in
what
other
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
all
of
these
convictions
are
---
convictions
were
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
pickens
was
reversed
because
of
among
other
maybe
two
reasons
but
one
of
them
was
that
his
himself
incriminatory
statement
was
admitted
against
him
in
violation
of
the
miranda
rule.
and
that
would
alone
lead
to
the
reversal
of
this
conviction,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
so
if
pickens
conviction
was
reversed
for
that
reason
alone,
if
--
if
for
no
other.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
each
claimed
but
he
was
the
one
who
didn't
get
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
all
five
respondents?
there
were
two
wood
brothers
and
then
there
were
three
others,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
question
about
the
involvement
of
the
wood
brothers?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
in
your
mind
or
after
reading
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
the
fellow
lying
on
the
floor?
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
think
those
three
others
came
there
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
they
did
come
there
and
the
evidence
was
that
they
swept
a
lot
of
the
money
off
the
table,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
--
what
do
you
suppose
the
reasonable
fact
finder
could
have
found
as
to
the
reason
that
those
three
others
were
came
there
all
that
night?
justice
potter
stewart
uh-huh.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
where
the
wood
brothers
white
man
and
the
three
respondents
negroes?
justice
potter
stewart
the
three
others.
that
is
my
impression.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
the
card
player,
wasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
some
of
which
he
considered
his
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
--
that
was
decided
or
everything
that
was
right?
justice
potter
stewart
because
all
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
decided
was
that
the
conviction
should
be
reversed
for
two
reasons
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
prove
a
felony
murder
and
secondly
a
violence
of
bruton.
and
the
--
that's
all
decided
and
that
was
sufficient
and
in
fact,
neither
one
of
those
was
sufficient
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
reverse
the
convictions.
and
then
the
state
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
at
jackson
and
according
to
appendix,
page
227,
where
the
opinion
of
that
court
appears.
they
say,
this
case
presents
two
principle
issues.
they
don't
say
it
presents
only
two
issues,
two
principal
issues,
i.e.
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
under
the
felony
murder
and
secondly,
the
bruton
point.
and
then
they
proceed
to
discuss
those
two
issues
separately
and
reversed
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
both
without
ever
discussing
any
miranda
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
my
brother
marshall's
question,
i
guess
is
some
importance,
was
there
before
them
the
miranda
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
which
should
not
been
dealt
with
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
eventhough
it
raised
there.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
--
certainly,
it
wasn't
surely
wasn't
dealt
with
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
uh-huh.
justice
potter
stewart
before
the
appellant?
justice
potter
stewart
as
curious.
justice
potter
stewart
your
client.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
violation
of
miranda?
