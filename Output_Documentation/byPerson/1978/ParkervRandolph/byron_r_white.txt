justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
terry,
tell
me.
mr.
pickens,
the
holding
below
is
of
his
confession
was
improperly
admitted
against
him,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
no
interlocking
confession
issue
as
to
him
under
bruton,
is
still
here?
is
the
case
considered?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is
improper
--
it
was
improperly
admitted
then
it's
obviously
no
interlocking
confession
issue
at
all
as
to
him,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
bruton
has
violated
as
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
what
--
what
you
have
suggested
it.
and
in
his
situation,
he
may
have
been
the
victim
of
a
conviction
on
hearsay
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
mr.
--
at
least
as
to
--
as
to
pickens,
isn't
he
entitled
a
little
affirmance
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
know
but
you
said
yourself,
as
i
understand
it,
the
three
confessions
were
introduced
afforded
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
been
held
now
that
pickens
was
improperly
introduced.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
if
--
if
his
conviction
rests
on
the
three
confessions
that
were
introduced,
why
isn't
that
a
bruton
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
--
as
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
if
conviction
rests
only
on
the
convict
--
on
the
confessions
of
the
others
that
were
introduced.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
--
what
you're
telling
me
is
this
evidence
other
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
confessions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
with
evidence
of
robert
wood.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
terry,
may
i
come
back
a
moment
with
these
pickens
and
wood's
testimony.
i'm
looking
at
footnote
27
of
your
brief
at
page
19.
petitioner's
cognition
of
this
court's
finding
that
pickens'
confession
was
admitted
in
violation
of
randolph.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
affirmed
that
this
finding
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
opinion.
this
court
remembered
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
bruton
issue
and
how
is
the
running
bruton
issue
here
as
to
pickens?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
not
here
complaining.
you're
complaining.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
satisfied
with
what
happen
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
his
--
if
his
confession
was
improperly
admitted.
then
i
don't
see
how
--
is
anything
about
his
confession
of
the
facts.
the
holding
was
to
bruton
in
his
favor.
the
pro
se
was
then
convicted
only
on
the
testimony
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
wny
what
--
what's
your
second
question
in
the
petition
for
cert
which
we
refuse
to
review.
does
this
apply
to
pickens?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
violated
2254
(d)
by
finding
out
one
of
the
respondents
was
denied
of
his
right
to
counsel,
is
that
pickens?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
refuse
to
review
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
going
to
deal
with
mr.
pickens'
case,
differently
from
the
other
two
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
trying
to
finish.
justice
byron
r.
white
actually,
all
you
want
is
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
you
in
the
state
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
if
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
dealt
with
the
miranda
issue
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
not
reach
the
miranda
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
neither
that
the
court
of
--
neither
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
reversed?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
this
--
what
the
highest
courts
of
the
state
think
of
the
miranda
issue,
we
have
no
idea
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
issue
has
never
been
exhausted
in
the
tennessee
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
was
though
presented
--
never
presented
in
the
state
supreme
court,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
true
--
that
would
be
true,
the
bruton
issue
would
dispose
of
the
case
but
the
--
that
decision
got
reversed
by
the
court
of
--
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
question
then
remains,
what
about
the
miranda
issue,
was
that
ever
decided
by
tennessee
courts?
and
i
think
that
depends
on
whether
is
presented
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
convictions
were
affirmed
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
and
if
the
miranda
issue
was
presented,
i
suppose
it
was
rejected.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
not
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
inquiring
whether
there's
been
exhaustion
in
terms
of
federal
habeas
corpus
of
the
miranda
issue,
exhaustion
in
the
state
court?
