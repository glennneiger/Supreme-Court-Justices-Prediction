we
take
this
on
one
point
only?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
do
we
get
to
harmless
error?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
do
you
think
bruton
is
in
there?
bruton
didn't
have
anything
to
harmless
error,
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
going
to
the
state's
argument,
the
only
people
that
didn't
confess
were
those
that
weren't
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
all
of
them
did
confess?
justice
thurgood

right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
one.

didn't
george

to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
the
man
who
testified,
did
he
say
that
they
were
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
evidence,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
--
if
he
met
them
for
a
second
isn't
that
testimony
that
they
were
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
long
does
that
mean,
two
seconds?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
want
us
to
reverse
the
supreme
court,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
--
did
various
in
every
state
it
seems
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
over
the
intermediary
court.
did
they
take
the
whole
case
or
part
of
the
case
or
certiorari
or
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
under
the
law
of
tennessee,
does
the
whole
thing
go
up
or
does
just
the
constitutional
part
of
it
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
all
of
it.
so
if
it
was
raised
in
the
lower
court,
if
went
to
the
supreme
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
after
that,
will
it
go
to
the
supreme
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
that's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
testimony
show
that
this
five
people
heard
the
shot?
did
any
of
them
go
run
in
that
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
they
heard
the
shot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
witnesses,
those
five
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
turned
me
again
to
wonder
why
these
three
went
in.
all
have
heard
the
shot.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
just
â€“

three
were
more
curious
than
the
five?
