caught.
chief

warren
e.

couldn't
congress

the
same
thing
in
this
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
teofan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
arguing,
mr.
teofan
that
if
texas
was
the
only
state
that
had
this
code
and
the
other
49
states
had
a
different
uniform
code.
the

do
it
while

are
having
lunch.

(inaudible).
chief

very
well,
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
barnett?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
didn't
file?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
a
practice
so.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
if
they
didn't
trample
their
practice
in
the
legitimate
case,
what
about
the
other
--
rights
of
other
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you

case

arguments

in
united
states
against
crittenden.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
mr.
barnett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hollis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
situation
with
respect
if
it's
possibly
relevant
and
if
you
know
in
most
of
the
states
as
to
a
lien
of
a
materialman,
a
painter
or
anyone
else
who
paints
a
house
which
has
a
mortgage
on
it
in
all
the
states
i
know
about
firsthand,
which
should
be
5
or
6
or
7.
the
materialman's
lien
was
superior
to
the
lien
of
the
mortgage
even
though
the
mortgage
was
first
in
time.
is
there
any
relationship
between
these
two
in
terms
of
doctrine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
preserved
well
if
he
didn't
answered
it,
he
is
at
least
preserving
the
security,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
it
another
way
if
you
know,
do
you
know
of
any
state
in
which
the
materialman's
lien
would
be
subordinate
to
the
first
lien
of
the
real
estate
mortgage
and
the
circumstances
i
mentioned.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
district
court
expressly
found
that
whether
under
georgia
law
or
under
a
federal
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
clarify
for
me
if
you
will,
what
you
say
is
the
status
now
here
in
this
court
of
the
district
court
finding
about
georgia
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
the
fifth
circuit
do
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
should
we
decide
that
here
when
the
fifth
circuit
is
assuming
thought
we
should
reach
it,
should
we
decided
here
and
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
reach
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
take
it
to
agree
with
if
the
court
concluded
we
needed
to
decide
that,
we
needed
to
decide
that,
we
shouldn't
decide
it
here
when
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
reach
it.
is
that
right?
you
say
we
don't
need
to
reach
it,
but
going
hypothetically
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
any
further
mr.
barnett?
chief
justice
warren

you,
gentlemen.

case
is
submitted.
