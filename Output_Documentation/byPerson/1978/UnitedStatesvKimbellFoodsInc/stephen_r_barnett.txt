mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
thank
you
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
private
lien
that
has
not
become
specific
and
definite,
that
has
not
become
choate
before
a
federal
lien
attaches
to
the
same
property
take
precedence
over
that
federal
lien.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
i
use
the
words
mr.
justice
brennan
so
as
not
to
rely
completely
on
the
technical
term
developed
by
this
court,
but
for
functional
purposes
i
think
choate
is
the
word
for
better
or
worse.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
mr.
justice
powell,
we
do
not
take
that
position,
the
crest
finance
case,
which
we
distinguish
here
may
clear
that
when
a
lien
--
when
the
amount
of
a
lien
is
evidenced
by
notes,
notes
bearing
face
values,
that
lien
is
choate
as
the
government
conceded
and
as
the
court
held
in
that
case,
even
though
it
was
not
reduced
to
judgment.
thus
if
the
future
advances
that
kimbell
made
in
this
case,
the
future
advances
had
been
evidenced
by
notes
as
where
the
inventory
advances
that
kimbell
made
in
1966
and
1968,
this
would
then
be
a
different
case
and
kimbell
then
would
have
a
choate
lien
with
respect
to
those
future
advances.
but
the
future
advances
here
were
not
evidenced
by
notes
that
the
lien
does
not
have
to
be
reduced
to
judgment
when
it
is
this
kind
of
a
lien,
but
there
is
a
significant
--
a
crucial
difference
between
having
a
dead
evidence
by
notes
and
having
a
simply
be
an
open
account
where
the
amount
is
indicated
perhaps
in
one
amount
on
the
sellers
books
and
another
amount
on
the
purposes
books
where
there
are
all
sorts
of
uncertainties
and
possible
differences
with
respect
to
the
amount
that
are
not
ironed
out
until
there
is
a
judgment.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
to
apply,
i
would
accept
your
statement
mr.
justice
rehnquist
except
for
the
last
phrase
to
apply
in
those
cases,
the
same
rules,
the
first
in
time
and
choateness
to
give
the
government
priority
therefore
when
it
prevails
under
those
rules
to
give
the
other
party
priority
when
it
prevails
under
those
rules.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
in
this
case?
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
not
a
direct
violation,
but
this
court
has
made
clear
in
its
decisions
that
the
--
there
is
a
violation
of
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
first
in
time,
first
in
right
rule
as
embodying
the
choateness
approach
to
determining
when
a
lien
arises.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
and
as
we
point
out,
commercial
lending
is
an
activity
of
the
federal
government.
the
sba
is
not
as
the
court
below
said
and
as
respondent
says,
simply
another
commercial
lender.
the
sba
makes
loans
for
matters
of
policy
not
simply
to
make
a
profit.
the
sba
authorized
under
a
statute,
which
provides
that
it
shall
make
loans
15
u.s.c.
636(a)(1)
to
small
business
concerns
where
financial
assistance
is
not
otherwise
available
on
reasonable
terms
from
non-federal
sources.
in
the
record
of
this
case
on
the
sba
loan
guarantee
application
at
a73,
that
policy
has
stated
as
the
first
of
the
sbas
loan
policies
"the
sba
will
not
extend
financial
assistance
if
the
funds
are
otherwise
available
on
reasonable
terms
from
normal
lending
sources
or
the
personal
resources
of
the
principles".
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
it
takes
greater
risks
but
it
needs
protection
that
is
consonant
with
those
risks.
this
court
in
the
area
of
tax
liens
decided
bringing
the
rule
over
from
the
insolvency
statute
that
the
government
needed
the
kind
of
protection
reflected
in
the
first
in
time,
first
in
right
rule
as
adumbrated
by
the
choateness
principle.
we
submit
that
unless
congress
says
otherwise,
it
is
appropriate
to
give
the
government
the
same
protection
here,
a
dollar
coming
in
on
recovery
of
an
sba
lien
is
the
same
to
the
government
as
a
dollar
collected
on
taxes.
in
fact,
congress
replenishes
the
amount
that
the
sba
loses,
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
congress
as
in
every
year,
since
the
establishment
of
the
sba
as
i
understand
it,
appropriated
at
least
enough
to
cover
the
amount
that
the
sba
lost.
so
that
if
the
sba
does
not
recover
on
its
security
and
it
does
in
fact
take
security
for
almost
virtually
all
its
loans,
congress
ends
up
appropriating
that
money.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
true
and
the
question
here
is
you
are
correct
to
what
extent
that
would
justify
imposing
on
the
government,
this
court
imposing
on
the
government
when
congress
has
not
done
so
risks
greater
than
had
been
imposed
on
the
government
in
the
context
of
federal
tax
liens.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
the
rule
that
is
contended
for
here
but
the
rule
that
has
previously
been
established
with
respect
to
interest
of
the
federal
government
by
this
court
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
because
congress
has
not
said
so
for
one
thing,
the
rule
was
laid
down
by
this
court
and
the
tax
lien
area
has
been
followed
by
the
courts
of
appeals
was
unanimously
followed
by
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i'm
asking
this
court
to
extend
this
since
this
court
has
not
done
so
but
the
courts
of
appeals
found
no
difficulty
at
all
in
concluding
that
the
reasons
this
court
had
given
for
the
rule
and
the
tax
lien
contacts
were
equally
applicable
to
contractual
liens.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
was
not
one
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
maybe.
it
was
not
one
of
the
rules
this
court
gave
for
its
doctrine
in
the
tax
lien
area.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
indeed
it
does,
it
loses
approximately
4%
in
the
latest
year.
the
question
is
whether
it
should
lose
more
because
of
a
rule
adopted
by
this
court
or
whether
congress
should
make
that
decision.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
but
the
question
from
what
basis
would
congress
start?
this
court
has
to
make
some
federal
law
today.
does
it
apply
the
previous
rule
or
does
it
reach
out
and
apply
for
example
state
law
or
the
ucc
or
one
of
the
concoctions
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
then
tell
congress
to
go
from
there.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
expect
to
collect
all
its
taxes,
i'm
sure
as
a
matter
of
practical
prediction
doesn't
expect
to.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
true.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
right
and
despite
that
this
court
by
laying
down
certain
rules
prior
to
the
tax
lien
act
of
1966
gave
the
government
a
certain
measure
of
protection.
now
the
congress
in
that
act
limited
the
protection
in
certain
very
specific
ways.
our
position
here
is
that
if
that
the
government
with
respect
to
its
contractual
liens
should
be
accorded
the
same
traditional
protection
and
if
congress
wants
to
specifically
limit
that
congress
is
the
body
that
should
do
it.
and
it
is
quite
significant
as
we
contend
that
when
congress
did
act
in
the
tax
lien
act
in
1966,
it
dealt
specifically
with
the
question
of
liens
for
future
advances,
which
is
involved
here
and
it
gave
only
very
limited
protection
to
those
liens.
it
provided
that
a
lien
for
future
advances
is
protected
only
if
the
advances
are
made
that
is
as
given
priority.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
it
could
precisely
but
what
the
court
below
has
done
and
what
respondent
urges
this
court
to
do
is
something
very
different,
something
that
would
give
much
less
protection
to
the
federal
lien
than
congress
decided
to
give
to
the
federal
tax
liens
in
the
1966
act.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
exactly,
not.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
do
not
think
the
court
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
don't
think
the
court
would
be
telling
them
not
to
use
normal
choate.
the
sba
does
check
the
question
is
what
rules
it
must
check
under
in
this
case,
if
it
had
checked,
it
might
well
have
decided
to
make
the
loan
anyway
indeed,
it
was
aware.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
might
have,
but
kimbell
might
have
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
might
have
made
that
request
or
demand
and
is
equally
possible
that
kimbell
would
have
refused.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no
i
don't
think.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
and
then
kimbell
would
have
continued
to
make
loans
on
the
same
basis,
i
don't
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
but
kimbell
here
concededly
might
have
said,
if
you
pay
us
off
we
will
release
our
collateral,
but
kimbell
here
was
also
demanding
that
it
keep
its
collateral
with
respect
to
the
future
advances.
now
it
is
not
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
but
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
kimbell
would
have
agreed
to
make
future
advances
without
keeping
some
collateral
for
that.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
but
maybe
if
the
borrower
okay,
we
are
not
assured
of
be
able
to
purchase
future
inventory
on
credit.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
i
concede
that
the
sba
here
could
have
demanded
of
kimbell
that
it
released
its
collateral.
it
is
not
entirely
cleare
to
me
and
certainly
there
would
be
cases
in
which
it
would
not
be
cleared
that
the
private
lender
would
be
willing
to
release
collateral.
so,
it
is
not
simply
a
question
of
making
the
sba
be
more
careful
but
protecting
some
of
the
loans,
the
admittedly
risky
loans
that
the
sba
does
make
because
that
its
business
to
make
risky
loans
and
the
question
here
is
the
measure
of
protection
that
the
sba
will
have
and
whether
that
measure
is
to
be
reduced
as
the
court
of
appeals
rule
here
would
reduce
it
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
congress
and
the
tax
lien
act
reduce
the
protection
of
federal
tax
liens.
and
indeed
we
find
it
ironic
that
the
reason
why
the
choateness
rule
is
said
here
to
be
no
longer
worth
following.
the
reason
why
two
circuits
the
fifth
and
ninth
have
abandoned
it
is
said
to
be
the
tax
lien
act
of
1966
which
modified
it
in
the
area
of
tax
liens,
but
yet,
the
very
rule
that
act
adopted
for
a
future
advances,
which
are
involved
here
is
much
more
protective
of
the
government's
interest
than
the
rule
that
is
proposed
here.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
does
and
congress
is
fully
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
white
and
congress
is
fully
able
to
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
on
these
facts
the
private
lender
would
have
lost,
would
have
had
its
liens
subordinate
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
over
an
intervening
perfected
mortgage.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
later
to
the
initial
agreement
prior
to
the
advances.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
would
have
been
on
notice
that
there
could
be
future
advances,
these
were
optional
but
yes,
would
have
taken
subordinate
to
those
future
advances
if
they
were
made.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
that
raises
the
question
of
how
uniform
is
the
uniform
commercial
code.
it
is
the
rule
in
texas
the
court
here
held,
it
is
fairly
clearing
the
rule
under
the
1972
amendments
to
the
uniform
commercial
code,
but
as
i
understand
that
those
amendments
have
been
adopted
by
only
some
21
states
today.
so,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
is
the
rule
in
the
49
states
that
have
adopted
these
codes.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
the
proposal
of
response
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
no,
no,
we
are
saying
take
the
common
law
principles
that
this
court
developed
on
the
basis
first
of
the
insolvency
statute
and
then
of
the
tax
lien
law.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
agree.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that's
true,
that's
true.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
that's
true.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
that
question.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
we
don't
agree
with
that
characterization
of
it.
we
would
say
that
congress
has
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
congress
has
modified
it
and
limited
it.
there
are
indeed
as
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
not
in
all
cases.
there
are
certain
lacuna
in
the
statute
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
macarthur
village
case
that
might
still
be
governed
by
this
court's
previous
decisions.
but
congress,
against
the
background
of
this
court's
previous
decisions
the
choateness
ruled
the
first
time
in
time
rule
crafted
limited
exceptions
in
the
statute.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
court
should
take
a
quite
different
approach
and
adopt
the
ucc
as
the
governing
federal
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that's
the
choice
although
it's
not
the
choice
to
court
of
appeals
show
after
all.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
but
the
law
of
texas
is
the
ucc.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
reason
why
that
is
not
a
good
idea
we
would
submit
is
because
state
law
is
varying
and
the
varying
reason
why
this
court
decided
in
clearfield
trust
that
the
choice
of
law
question
here
was
a
federal
question
in
the
first
place
was
primarily
the
need
for
uniformity.
the
court
has
since
emphasized
that
in
the
little
lake
misere
case
and
in
miree
versus
dekalb
county.
a
rule
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yeah,
but
a
rule
that
a
rule
that
simply
incorporate
into
the
law
at
various
states
with
respect
to
this
question
which
is
very
much
a
question
of
the
nationwide
operation
of
a
program
and
which
is
rather
close
to
questions
of
commercial
paper
would
undermine
the
purpose
of
uniformity.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
think
it
was,
mr.
justice
stevens.
also
would
undermine
here
when
we
submit
another
reason
for
the
application
of
federal
law
in
the
first
place,
which
is
the
principle
of
federal
supremacy
if
you
well
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
new
britain
case,
the
federal
property
interest
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
sway
of
state
law
and
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
am
not
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i'm
sorry
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case.
so,
i
cannot
say,
even
with
respect
to
the
ucc
when
it
is
argued
here
that
the
ucc
should
be
adopted,
there
are
various
kinds
of
uncertainty
that
that
would
create,
which
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
of.
for
example,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
ucc
rules
may
vary
very
considerably
in
different
states,
there
is
the
question
of
what
would
be
the
scope
of
this
asserted
adoption
of
the
ucc.
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
here
said
we
are
adopting
the
ucc
with
respect
to
when
the
state
lien
arises,
we
are
not
adopting
it
at
least
not
yet
with
respect
to
the
relation
that
question
and
we
leave
for
another
day,
the
question
of
whether
we
would
apply
the
ucc
in
cases
of
other
kinds
of
liens,
mechanics
liens,
repairman's
liens,
which
the
court
said
raise
entirely
different
questions.
well,
if
the
ucc
is
to
be
embraced
by
this
court
as
the
governing
code
of
federal
law
in
these
cases
where
does
the
embrace
stop?
does
it
or
does
it
not
include
those
repairman's
liens
and
mechanics
liens
and
state
tax
liens
and
the
questions
that
they
raise.
the
respondent
would
apparently
say
that
this
court
should
limit
the
embrace
to
what
consensual
liens,
which
arise
under
the
ucc.
on
what
basis
would
that
limit
be
established
with
this
court
be
telling
the
other
federal
courts
that
they
cannot
use
the
ucc
with
respect
to
those
other
liens
that
they
must
or
what?
there
would
be
considerable
uncertainties
engendered,
which
are
illustrated,
of
course
by
the
crittenden
case,
which
i'll
have
occasion
to
discuss
in
greater
detail
later.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
but
even
if
we
knew
what
the
georgia
law
was
the
proposal
would
might
be
to
adopt
the
ucc,
even
if
the
georgia
law
is
different.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
with
respect
to
when
the
state
lien
arises,
i
read
the
opinion
as
saying
we
will
follow
ucc
principles
on
that.
it
happens
that
texas
here
had
adopted
the
ucc,
but
i
find
nothing
in
this
case
to
indicate
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
saying
we
will
follow
state
law,
if
that
law
happens
to
diverge
from
the
ucc.
and
well,
i
agree
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
problems
in
crittenden
are
more
complicated,
my
point
is
where
would
adoption
of
the
ucc
stop,
would
it
not
engender,
all
sorts
of
such
problems,
which
to
adopt
where
the
ucc
varies
from
state
law
to
what
extent
to
follow
the
ucc.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
you
would
have
in
the
state
but
you
would
a
complete
overturning
of
the
principle
of
uniformity,
which
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
because
congress
has
not
said
so
for
one
thing,
if
that
precise
approach
was
a
prose
to
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
that
precise
approach
was
made
to
congress
in
the
drafting
of
1966
tax
lien
act
as
cited
in
our
brief
here.
it
was
proposed
that
federal
tax
liens
be
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
is
it
or
isn't
it?
that's
the
case
here.
we
say
that's
the
federal
government
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
then
we
would
cite
the
need
for
uniformity,
which
this
court
rely.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
one
need
is
that
a
federal
agency
operating
a
nationwide
program
has
to
have
some
ability
to
rely
on
nationwide
standards,
it
uses
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
it
uses
similar
forms.
its
attorneys
are
transferred
from
one
state
to
another
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
is
not
the
federal
government.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
and
also
because
this
court
has
recognized
that
that
is
a
reason
for
applying
federal
law
in
these
states.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no.
in
clearfield
trust,
this
court
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
true,
but
in
clearfield
trust
the
proposition
was
that
the
need
for
uniformity
is
the
reason
for
making
it
a
question
of
federal
law
in
the
first
place
in
a
commercial
area
such
as
this.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
i
borrow
that,
these
all
things?
well,
i
don't
need
it.
the
statements
from
the
sba
manual
that
my
brother
quotes
makes
clear
that
the
rights
and
that
were
quoted
in
the
yazell
makes
clear
that
the
rights
of
the
sba
arise
under
federal
law
quote
when
the
united
states
disperses
its
funds,
it
is
exercising
a
constitutional
functional
power
and
its
rights
and
duties
are
governed
by
federal
rather
than
local
law.
however,
it
is
frequently
necessary
in
the
obtaining
of
a
marketable
title
or
enforceable
security
interest
in
property
to
follow
local
procedure
requirements
in
statutes
and
so
forth
really
it's
a
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
only
thing
in
the
sba
act
that
relates
to
liens
is
the
section
that
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
and
discussed
which
provides
that
sba
liens
are
specifically
subordinated
to
state
and
local
liens
for
property
taxes.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
congress
specifically
did
that
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
a
lien
does
not
arise
under
state
law
or
the
ucc.
a
lien
arises
as
in
this
case
from
the
security
agreement,
the
security
agreement
is
filed
under
state
law
of
the
ucc
but
the
ucc
does
not
create
the
lien
and
that
is
the
policy
in
my
brother's
argument.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
that
is
the
question
in
this
case
whether
the
federal
law
does
and
the
question
in
this
case
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
this
court
has
relied
on
the
first
in
time
rule
as
federal
law
for
one
thing
and
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
there
is
nothing
in
the
sba
act
except
that
specific
provision
which
does
subordinate
sba
liens
but
only
for
a
carefully
tailored
exception.
and
as
you
were
pointing
out
mr.
justice
white
the
sba
may
not
have
to
file
under
state
law
but
it
does
and
that
is
the
answer
to
my
brother's
contention
that
people
may
never
know
when
they
are
dealing
with
the
sba.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
as
a
matter
of
convenience
and
as
a
matter
of
allowing
other
people
to
rely
in
the
commercial
world,
they
do
file,
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
their
lien
is
thereby
created
under
state
law
and
it
doesn't
follow
the
state
law
should
govern
their
priority
rights.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
not
this
case.
we
are
not
here
defending
a
situation
in
which
the
sba
lien
has
not
been
trialed.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes
that
is
the
practice.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
we
would
have
or
at
least
would
have
difficulty
defending
that
situation
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
i
think
there
are
reliance
rights
that
the
government
would
have
to
respect,
and
i
think
it
is
the
government's
practice
and
should
be
the
government's
practice
to
comply
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
to
comply
with
the
local
procedures
and
forms
is
all
not
to
follow
or
not
to
be
bound
by
state
law
as
to
government
rights
and
priorities
and
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
so
far
as
procedures
and
forms
are
concerned.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
true,
but
not
that
does
not
imply
that
state
law
governs
the
rights
as
the
earlier
part
of
the
regulation
says
the
state
law
governs
the
governments
rights.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
don't
think
it
carves
anything
out
except
as
a
matter
of
the
government's
discretionary
decision
to
follow
the
state
procedures.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
this
is
an
abundance
of
caution
in
a
manual
that
the
sba
is
directing
towards
employees,
it
is
not
a
statement
of
applicable
law
being
made
in
court
or
elsewhere.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
too
involves
competing
liens
in
a
tractor.
the
federal
government
this
time
through
the
farmers'
home
administration
of
the
department
of
agriculture
had
a
lien
in
the
tractor
as
security
for
loans
it
made
to
the
farmer.
after
this
lien
had
been
established,
the
farmer
took
the
tractor
to
respondent
for
repairs
and
the
question
is
whether
respondent
statutory
repairman's
lien
takes
precedence
over
the
earlier
federal
lien
under
principles
of
super
priority
or
on
the
other
hand
whether
the
government's
lien
prevails
under
the
principle
of
first
in
time,
first
in
right.
the
fha
makes
loans
pursuing
to
what
is
now
the
consolidated
farm
and
rural
development
act
to
farmers,
who
are
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
credit
elsewhere
to
finance
their
actual
needs
at
reasonable
rates
in
terms.
thus
like
the
sba,
the
fha
is
engaged
in
lending
not
to
make
a
profit
but
to
serve
a
policy
interest
of
the
federal
government.
the
distinction
that
my
brother
in
the
former
case
tried
to
make
between
sovereign
and
commercial
functions
of
the
government,
he
submitted
it
is
not
a
valid
distinction
and
this
court
made
that
clear
in
cases
such
as
indian
towing
when
the
government
lends
money
through
the
fha
it
is
performing
a
governmental,
a
sovereign
function
for
reasons
of
policy.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
kimbell.
indeed
the
provisions
of
the
fha's
policy
is
written
into
the
security
agreement
in
this
case
at
appendix
page
10
in
the
security
agreement
it
expressly
provides
that
if
at
any
time
it
appears
to
the
fha
that
the
debtor
can
obtain
a
reasonable
loan
elsewhere,
that
is
a
loan
on
reasonable
terms
elsewhere,
the
debtor
will
at
the
fha's
request
apply
for
that
loan
and
pay
off
the
fha.
this
was
apparently
quite
a
tractor
in
this
case
because
between
november
1972
and
july
1973,
the
farmer
brought
it
into
respondent
for
repairs
a
total
of
seven
times.
in
each
case
respondent
made
the
repairs
and
returned
the
tractor
to
the
farmer,
who
did
not
pay
his
bill.
by
july
of
1973
the
amount
of
the
bill
was
$1,600.
when
the
respondent
brought
the
tractor
and
again
for
the
eighth
time
in
december
1973
this
time
for
repairs
that
raise
the
account
to
$2100,
the
respondent
kept
possession
of
the
tractor
while
awaiting
payment.
when
the
tractor
was
finally
sold
in
1978
incidentally
it
was
sold
for
$1,500,
less
than
the
repair
bill
although
admittedly
this
was
three
years
after
the
or
this
was
five
years
after
the
repairs
had
been
made.
well
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
not
a
farm
boy.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
the
court
of
appeals
in
kimbell
foods
rejected
the
choateness
rule
for
determining
lien
priority.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
rejected
the
even
more
fundamental
rule
of
first
in
time,
first
in
right.
a
rule
that
goes
back
in
this
court
to
the
1827
decision
in
rankin
versus
scott
in
which
chief
justice
marshall
stated
that
the
principle
is
believe
to
be
universal
that
a
prior
lien
gives
a
prior
claim,
which
is
entitled
to
prior
satisfaction
out
of
the
subjected
banks.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
it
did,
not
quite
a
ucc
principle,
the
court
here
took
a
rather
hybrid
approach,
it's
started
with
the
ucc
but
the
ucc
in
this
case
incorporates
state
law
the
court
then
looked
to
see
what
georgia
law
was
decided
that
either
georgia
law
was
unclear
or
it
was
unfavorable,
the
court
then
looked
back
to
the
ucc
decided
that
it
would
adopt
the
ucc
provision
but
without
the
part
of
the
ucc
provision
that
says
unless
georgia
law
--
unless
state
law
provides
otherwise
and
then
finally
the
court
picked
up
a
piece
of
the
federal
tax
lien
act
of
1966
to
complete
its
collage.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
we
take
the
position
that
georgia
law
is
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
that
under
georgia
law
there
is
no
such
super
priority
here
but
it's
not
a
position
we
rely
on,
it's
not
a
question
of
state
law.
but
to
answer
the
broader
implications
of
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
if
the
court
here
were
to
take
the
position
that
state
law
governs
we
think
it
would
have
all,
we
think
there
would
be
all
sorts
of
problems
with
that
rule.
for
one
thing,
it
would
destroy
the
uniformity,
which
we
insist
that
this
court
has
recognized
beginning
with
the
clearfield
trust
case,
in
clearfield
trust
and
the
court
here
recognized
that
the
fifth
circuit
here
relied
on
kimbell
and
in
its
earlier
hicks
case,
the
fifth
circuit
in
stating
that
federal
law
governs
stated
the
principle
reason
supporting
the
application
of
federal
law
is
a
need
for
uniform
rule
of
decision
to
govern
the
rights
of
the
united
states
and
the
administration
of
a
large
scale
program.
now
that
need
for
uniformity
would
be
particularly
destroyed
in
a
situation
of
this
case
where
the
states
are
quite
split
on
the
question
of
super
priority
for
repairmen's
liens.
as
we
note
in
our
brief
page
27
no
24
there
are
at
least
13
states
that
have
been
held
to
have
statutes,
which
deny
the
repairmen
the
super
priority
those
are
13th
cited
cases,
i
am
sorry,
to
find
the
13,
the
alr
annotation
cited
their
list
ten
and
our
citations
include
three
more.
those
are
cases
that
have
held
that
states
have
such
statues,
there
may
be
other
states
that
do.
thus
they
would
be
quite
a
divergence
in
what
the
rule
is
under
state
law
and
recent
method
this
would
make
it
quite
difficult
for
federal
agencies
to
administer
their
programs.
now
the
yazell
case,
which
has
been
cited
in
opposition
to
this
principle,
was
a
case
involving
a
state
law
of
marital
property
and
while
the
court
there
followed
that
law,
there
is
a
statement
in
the
opinion
saying
that
if
the
sba
regulations
worked
to
the
contrary,
the
result
might
be
different.
the
sba
regulations
now
are
to
the
contrary.
we
submitted
that
case
is
very
far
from
questions
of
commercial
law
as
are
involved
in
this
case.
in
little
lake
misere
as
well
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
land
acquisition
there
although
it
was
an
acquisition
of
land,
the
kind
of
thing
traditionally
governed
by
local
law,
quote
is,
when
arising
from
and
bearing
heavily
upon
a
federal
regulatory
program.
choice
of
law
is
therefore
a
federal
decision.
in
miree
versus
dekalb
county,
in
applying
state
law,
the
court
said
the
question
here
does
not
require
decision
under
federal
common
law
since
the
litigation
is
among
private
parties
and
no
substantial
rights
or
duties
of
the
us
hinge
on
the
outcome.
well,
in
this
case
substantial
rights
and
duties
of
the
us
do
hinge
on
the
outcome,
the
litigation
is
not
between
private
parties
but
the
united
states
is
involved
and
we
submit
that
not
only
does
clearfield
trust
apply
but
the
principle
of
uniformity
that's
imbibed
in
clearfield
trust
would
be
inconsistent
with
borrowing
or
adopting
state
law
as
well.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
has.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
i
think
it
could
by
regulation.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
think
it
could
by
regulation
of
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
it
has
the
specific
security
agreement
here
gives
that
the
specific
authority
to
subordinate
its
lien
if
it
wishes
to
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
don't
see,
well,
i
don't
could
protect
itself,
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
oh,
no,
no
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
i
don't
think
so
i
misunderstood,
i
thought
you
are
asking
whether
it
could
subordinate
its
lien
by
regulation
and
in
this
case
it
tried
to
protect
itself
that
provided
in
the
security
agreement
that
the
borrower
may
not
encumber
the
tractor
without
its
permission,
i
don't
think
the
sba
could
do
that
simply
by
regulation.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
congress
could.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
don't
know,
i
will
have
to
recheck
my
statement
mr.
justice
white,
i
simply
don't
know
whether
would
have
the
authority
under
regulation
to
do
that
or
not
to
protect
itself,
to
enact
the
rule
that
we
are
saying
here
is
a
rule
of
federal
common
law.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
would
recognize
as
federal
common
law.
i
don't
know,
i
rather
doubt
but
i
do
not
want
to
say
where
the
sba
would
have
that
authority
under
regulation.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
yes,
as
i
was
saying
the
first
in
time
rule
goes
way
back
in
this
court
and
has
been
uniformly
applied
by
this
court.
the
second
circuit
for
example
recognize
that
in
the
macarthur
senior
village
case,
the
congress
in
the
tax
lien
act
of
1966
did
of
course
make
some
exceptions
to
the
rule
in
the
case
of
federal
tax
liens
but
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
those
exceptions
were
carefully
tailored.
in
particular
the
second
circuit
in
the
macarthur
village
case
noted
one
such
exception
in
the
tax
lien
act
26
u.s.c.
6323(b)(7)
which
applies
to
mechanics
liens
for
the
repair
or
improvement
of
a
personnel
residence
containing
not
more
than
four
dwelling
units,
occupied
by
the
owner
of
such
residence
but
only
if
the
contract
price
is
not
more
than
$1000.
well,
now
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
were
appalled
the
decision
that
relies
in
part
on
the
federal
tax
lien
act,
one
may
wonder
among
other
things,
what
the
law
would
be
with
respect
to
this
particular
kind
of
mechanics
lien
or
any
other
particular
kind.
would
the
court
here
gives
super
priority
to
the
that
kind
of
lien
even
though
the
tax
lien
act
would
not,
would
it
give
super
priority
only
up
to
the
amount
of
a
$1000,
would
it
incorporate
to
a
limited
of
only
four
dwelling
units
in
the
residence.
this
is
we
submit
an
example
of
the
kind
of
uncertainties
that
are
created
by
the
decision
here
and
we
submitted
wouldn't
help
to
adopt
any
of
the
alternatives
to
the
court
of
appeals
ad
hoc
eclecticism
here
for
the
reasons
i
noted
a
few
moments
ago
on
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
submit
that
we
are
not
held
to
adopt
state
law
for
one
thing
state
law
is
very
inconsistent
on
the
précised
question
here
for
another
thing
uniformity
is
important
we
think
and
for
yet
another
thing
the
policy
that
state
law
should
not
be
able
to
hold
sway
over
federal
property
interest
is
involved,
now
of
course
it
can
be
said
that
if
this
court
were
to
borrow
or
to
adopt
the
rule
borrowing
state
law,
the
court
is
of
course
always
free
to
examine
a
particular
state
law
to
determine
whether
its
hostile
to
federal
interest
or
aberrant.
but
we
submitted
that
would
be
a
lot
of
ad
hoc
law-making
for
this
court
to
do
and
would
involve
supervision
and
criticism
of
state
laws
in
a
very
large
area
the
whole
of
commercial
law,
which
would
be
approaching
inferior
to
that
of
adopting
or
adhering
to
the
clear
federal
rule
first
in
time,
first
in
right.
it
is
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
again
i
don't
know
about
an
agency
regulation
but
certainly
it
could
be
varied
by
congress.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
varied
by
subordinating
its
claim.
my
point
is
i'm
not
sure
that
the
yes
the
agency
regulation
can
subordinate
its
claim,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
can
strengthen
or
protect
its
claim.
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
is
one
that
no
one
could
have
predicted
and
one
we
submit
should
not
be
appalled
because
it
would
create
havoc
with
commercial
transactions.
now
it
may
be
suggested,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
model
ucc
should
be
adopted
instead
because
it
is
suppose
that
the
uniform
has
state
law
isn't
on
this
question
and
because
it
would
not
be
such
a
unique
concoction
as
the
court
of
appeals
reached
here.
however,
we
submit
that
alternative
would
not
be
acceptable
either.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
at
least
13
states
have
statutes
that
had
been
held
to
give
priority
to
the
earlier
lienor
against
the
subsequent
repairmen
and
i
assume
that
would
allow
replevin
as
well
as
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes.
if
the
ucc
is
looked
to
one
problem
was
that
here
and
it
is
a
problem
that
implicates
the
kimbell
case
as
well
is
that
the
ucc
here
itself
refers
to
state
law,
so
that
if
state
law
is
inconsistent
the
resulting
rule
would
be
inconsistent
as
well
and
as
i
mentioned
in
the
kimbell
argument
that
it
seems
to
us
as
a
problem
with
a
adopting
the
ucc
in
the
kimbell
situation
how
do
you
exclude
the
situation
in
mechanics
liens
that
is
presented
here,
just
what
is
the
scope
that
the
of
the
rule
that
is
being
adopted,
how
would
one
know
to
what
extent
and
with
respect
to
what
kinds
of
liens
court
should
use
the
ucc
or
should
not.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
another
respect
in
what
the
ucc
is
inconsistent,
it
is
not
uniform,
it
has
not
been
adopted
everywhere,
it
has
not
been
adopted
in
the
louisiana
at
all,
the
provisions
of
the
original
ucc
the
1962
version
have
themselves
not
been
adopted
everywhere
as
illustrated
by
georgia's
failure
to
adopt
the
provision
in
this
case.
amendments
are
not
adopted
immediately
if
at
all
and
judicial
interpretations
vary
and
as
the
first
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
chicago
title
case
with
respect
to
mechanics
liens
in
particular
there
are
many
local
eccentricities.
we
see
no
way
in
which
those
eccentricities
could
fail
to
lead
to
confusion
and
uncertainty
in
the
situation
of
this
case
and
we
see
no
way
in
which
if
the
ucc
were
adopted
in
the
kimbell
situation,
those
uncertainties
would
not
creep
into
the
rule
to
create
havoc
in
the
general
rule
and
we
submit
that
it
is
for
congress
to
determine
to
what
extent
federal
contractual
liens
and
in
what
precise
respects
federal
contractual
lien
should
be
subordinated
to
the
ucc
to
state
law
or
anything
else
and
again
we
find
it
significant
to
what
congress
did
in
the
1966
tax
lien
act
was
to
reject
the
proposal
that
it
simply
adopt
state
law
and
place
federal
tax
liens
on
the
same
basis
as
other
liens
under
state
law
but
instead
adopted
a
carefully
crafted
set
of
federal
rules
for
federal
tax
liens.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
not
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
our
lien
is
first
in
time
by
any
definition.
we
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
choateness
rule
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
exactly,
whatever
choateness
means
a
lien
is
presumably
inchoate
when
it
does
not
yet
exist.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
exactly,
exactly.
well,
now
respondent
has
made
an
equitable
argument
that
it
is
somehow
unfair
to
the
--
unfair
for
the
first
lienor
to
be
given
priority
on
the
basis
of
first
in
time,
first
in
right
that
the
repairmen
contributes
value
to
the
chattel
and
it
is
unfair
to
deprive
him
of
a
prior
lien
for
that
value.
we
think
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
argument
should
not
be
accepted,
one
is
it
significant
that
it
has
not
been
accepted
in
a
number
of
states
at
least
13,
the
equity
that
is
so
clear
to
respondent
is
apparently
not
so
clear
to
legislatures
in
that
state.
in
addition
it
should
be
noted
that
in
reality
we
are
not
the
first
in
time
rule
does
not
mean
that
the
first
lienor
has
an
unchangeable
primacy,
it
simply
sets
a
starting
point
from
which
the
parties
made
deal,
a
clear
starting
point.
if
it
is
true
that
the
value
of
the
repairs
would
increase
the
value
of
the
chattel
more
than
the
price
of
the
repairs
then
it
follows
the
first
lienor
would
presumably
consent
to
release
of
the
portion
of
the
collateral
for
the
repairs
and
indeed
the
fha
in
the
security
agreement
in
this
case
we
take
precisely
that
option
in
the
record
at
a9,
the
security
agreement
on
one
hand
requires
the
debtor
to
careful
and
maintain
the
collateral
in
good
and
husband
like
manner
and
goes
on
to
provide
in
paragraph
3f
that
the
fha
has
the
right
to
advance
funds
for
the
preservation
or
protection
of
the
collateral
with
such
advances
to
be
added
to
the
amount
of
the
note
at
the
same
way
of
interest,
so
the
question
really
is
who
decides
whether
the
repair
will
increase
the
value
of
the
chattel
and
is
provident
thing
to
do.
the
first
lienor
the
fha
here
has
tried
to
maintain
to
retain
that
right
of
decision
and
we
submit
that
under
the
rule
of
first
in
time
that
right
appropriately
belongs
to
the
first
lienor
and
that
there
is
nothing
inequitable
about
that
case.
the
repairs
may
well
be
reasonable
is
conceivable
however
that
they
are
not
reasonable
without
suggesting
that
they
are
unreasonable
in
this
case
and
might
be
pointed
out
that
we
have
more
than
$2000
worth
of
repairs
on
a
tractor
that
was
eventually
sold
for
only
5000.
it
is
conceivable
that
the
fha
if
asked,
as
it
was
entitled
to
be
asked,
would
have
decided
nor
might
be
better
for
the
farmer
to
buy
a
new
tractor.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
court
of
appeals
said
only
for
the
$500
worth
of
repairs.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that's
all
we
are
appealing
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
was
the
last
trip
to
the
shop.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes
the
last
trip
to
the
shop.
well,
that's
all
we
are
appealing
in
this
case
mr.
justice
white
the
principle
of
whether
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
yes
but
the
repairmen
might
keep
possession
from
the
very
start.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
one
may
wonder
here
why
he
went
through
--
went
up
$1,500
returning
the
tractor
each
time
without
doing
anything
to
see
whether
the
farmer
would
ever
be
able
to
pay.
indeed
that
raises
the
question
of
the
so
called
of
the
practical
problems
that
respondent
cites
arguing
that
there
is
no
way
for
repairmen
to
protect
themselves
if
the
first
in
time.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
exactly
and
we
say
that
our
way
is
the
way
that
of
course
was
the
first
in
the
time
rule
that
this
court
has
followed
since
1827
and
that
is
not
only
the
traditional
way
but
we
suggested
as
the
clear
uncertain
way
rather
than
a
way
which
would
cause
all
sorts
of
uncertainty
and
complications
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
one
way
or
the
other
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
model
uniform
commercial
code
says
that
the
repairman
in
possession
has
super
priority
unless
the
repairmen's
lien
is
created
by
a
state
statute
and
that
statute
provides
otherwise
at
least
13
state
statutes
do
provide
otherwise,
and
thus
the
rule
under
the
model
code
depends
on
the
rule
in
the
states.
thank
you
i
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
just
one
single
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
has
been
suggested
that
the
clearfield
trust
case
and
the
policies
inherent
in
it
perhaps
need
reconsideration
by
the
court.
i
would
simply
point
out
that
the
court
below
in
both
of
these
cases
explicitly
held
that
federal
law
governs
the
cert
petitions
present
and
no
question
on
the
score.
and
if
the
court
were
to
be
interested
in
reconsidering
clearfield
trust,
we
would
be
interested
in
submitting
a
brief
on
that
question
now.
i
know
that
it
hasn't
been
suggested
that
clearfield
trust
be
reconsidered
with
the
spect
of
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
decision
of
federal
law
or
not,
but
we
would
submit
that
if
state
law
is
to
borrowed
on
a
wholesale
basis
that
implicates
the
policies
embodied
in
the
clearfield
trust
decision.
we
submit
that
the
main
policy
embodied
there
is
uniformity
and
if
state
law
is
to
be
borrowed
on
a
wholesale
basis,
one
is
going
to
encounter
on
certainty,
sacrifices
of
the
federal
interest
and
perhaps
even
more
uncertainty
than
one
would
have
if
one
decided
that
it
was
a
state
question
in
the
first
place.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
true.
i
simply
wish
to
suggest
that
if
that
question
is
to
be
reconsidered,
we
would
be
willing
to
submit
a
brief
on
it.
thank
you.
