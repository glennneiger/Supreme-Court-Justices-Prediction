mr.
barnett,
are
you
familiar
with
the
position
the
government
took
in
the
argument
of
butner
case
arising
out
of
the
second
mortgage
situation
in
north
carolina?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether
in
determining
whether
the
second
mortgagee
has
to
reduce
the
property
to
possession
whether
they
should
be
governed
by
a
federal
rule
or
by
reference
to
state
law
and
the
united
states
in
that
case,
where
it's
a
creditor,
argued
that
the
reference
should
be
to
state
law,
the
federal
rule
should
be
that
we
should
refer
to
matter
to
state
law
and
it's
one
of
those
any
basic
difference
between
the
two
kinds
of
situations
in
connection
with
the
need
for
uniformity.
