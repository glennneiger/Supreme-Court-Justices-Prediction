mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
broad
impact
of
this
case
is
reflected
in
the
amicus
briefs
filed
both
in
this
case
and
in
the
kimbell
case
but
the
impact
is
broader
than
that
because
the
individuals
with
the
federal
loan
programs
would
design
to
protect
and
to
benefit
or
the
indirect
are
going
to
be
affected
by
the
decision
of
this
court
if
it
overrules
the
fifth
circuit
and
this
is
true
because
the
utilization
of
the
first
in
time
choate
lien
doctrines
ultimately
creates
a
situation
where
a
lender
or
where
a
mechanic
will
not
be
with
one
who
has
previously
always
going
to
deal
with
the
federal
government.
apparently
the
government
has
abandoned
the
choate
lien
concept
in
the
context
of
this
case.
in
their
brief
they
utilized
the
kimbell
argument
as
their
first
argument
and
i
gather
today
the
counsel
is
admitted
to
the
court
that
choateness
is
not
a
concept
or
not
a
doctrine
this
court
may
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
extend
or
amplify
the
first
in
time
rule.
however
the
first
in
time
rule
incorporates
and
embraces
the
concept
of
choateness,
so
it's
somewhat
difficult
to
separate
too.
the
question
is
whether
to
expand
a
rule
that
was
developed
in
the
context
of
tax
lien
statute
and
the
insolvency
statute
into
a
commercial
arena.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
the
choateness
test
was
--
my
understanding
was
developed
to
determine
that
point
in
time
at
what
you
are
competing
lien
was
entitled
to
compete
with
the
federal
lien.
so
you
need
to
utilize
it,
when
you
consider
on
the
first
in
time
doctrine
to
determine
that
point
in
time
at
which
you
are
competing
lien
may
or
may
not
compete.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
that's
correct.
notwithstanding
that
fact
the
government
attempted
to
apply
the
concept
of
choateness
in
this
case
and
did
so
in
the
brief.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
there
would
be
no
problem
if
we
were
in
a
state
court
but
there
is
a
problem
in
as
much
as
the
government
contented
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
state
law
is
not
clear
as
to
whether
or
not
the
mechanic
would
have
a
priority
under
split
georgia
statute.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i
say
it
is
clear
by
virtue
of
the
argument
which
we
made
in
the
later
portion
of
our
brief
and
which
the
district
court
judge
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
no
this
court
can
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
court
by
adopting
the
federal
common
law
rule
based
upon
the
uniform
commercial
code
that
the
fifth
circuit
adopted.
you
start
from
the
proposition
as
the
court
has
suggested
that
it
will
that
federal
law
must
pertain.
then
the
next
question
is
what
law
of
what
will
be
the
rule
of
law
has
been
suggested
that
you
can
go
directly
to
state
law
and
so
we
will
apply
state
law
period
or
we
will
fashion
a
federal
rule
based
upon
something,
whether
the
state
law
or
in
the
case
of
the
fifth
circuit
upon
the
model
uniform
commercial
code.
the
rule
so
fashioned
at
least
does
this,
it
is
a
commercial
rule
that
was
designed
and
developed
for
using
a
commercial
transaction,
it
is
not
a
rule
that
was
designed
to
determine
tax
priorities
and
it
is
a
rule
that
composed
with
1962
instead
of
late
1800s,
it's
a
recent
rule.
the
other
aspect
of
utilizing
a
federal
common
law
rule
based
upon
the
uniform
commercial
code
as
we
have
indicated
a
little
earlier
and
as
the
court
has
become
a
way
of
respect
to
sba
and
fha
the
regulations
in
sales
direct
the
lending
offices
and
direct
the
agencies
to
utilize
and
incorporate
and
take
advantage
of
and
consider
local
law
and
local
enterprise,
when
determining
how
to
transact
their
business
on
a
local
level
on
the
uniform
commercial
code,
does
embrace
a
concept
of
locality
the
very
same
law,
which
the
government
relied
upon
in
this
case
to
a
originally
perfected
security
interest.
this
court
has
never
applied
the
first
in
time
rule
of
any
area
of
commerce,
it's
been
restricted
to
the
tax
lien
area
and
the
insolvency
statute
though
the
government
is
prevailed
upon
some
of
the
lower
courts
to
extend
and
amplify
that
doctrine.
no
statutory
basis
at
all
for
extending
the
doctrine
and
again
the
fha
regulations
rely
to
the
point
that
the
federal
government
makes
in
its
brief,
they
contend
that
the
first
in
time
rule
is
a
uniform
universal
rule
and
that
there
are
no
exceptions.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
no,
the
statute
itself
requires
that
fha
advances
be
secured
as
the
secretary
deems
necessary
and
appropriate
so
directs
that
fha
conduct
himself
as
a
commercial
lender
that
they
take
back
security
for
moneys
advance.
the
regulations
--
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
the
reading
the
regulations
is
somewhat
experience
from
reading
uniform
commercial
code,
you
have
the
concept
of
a
security
agreement,
which
was
developed
in
the
--
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
yes,
sir
it
goes
it's
part
and
parcel.
for
example
there
is
even
one
portion
of
the
regulations
that
informs
the
local
lender
about
an
esoteric
farm
loan
for
less
than
$2500,
which
is
a
modern
ucc
provision,
it's
really
--
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
under
the
government's
position
--
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
to
determine
priorities.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
we
contend
that
it
would
not
that
the
uniform.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
because
the
court
should
apply
a
federal
rule
such
as
the
one
fashioned
by
the
fifth
circuit
as
you
--
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i
don't
concede
that
this
court
should
apply
federal
law
but
apparently
the
court
has
already
indicated
that
the
base
question
is
whether
or
not
to
consider
this
as
a
federal
case
or
a
purely
state
case.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i
think
that's
exactly
what
i'm
attempting
to
say
is
that
those
are
the
two
questions.
first
we
are
going
to
decide
it
conceptually
as
a
federal
rule
and
then
we
have
fashioned
a
federal
although
directly
to
state
law
as
a
federal
rule.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i
suppose
if
the
regulation
was
not
in
conflict
with
the
federal
rule
that
was
adopted
that
it
would.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
well,
in
this
instance,
it
would
have
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
case
law
because
there
is
no
statute.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
well,
i
understand
it
and
the
way
that
understood
the
discussion
early,
the
fha
can
issue
almost
any
kind
of
regulations
it
wants
to.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i'm
not
sure,
whether
they
--
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i
don't,
i
think
they
could
but
it
would
not
seem
to
me
that
they
will
be
enforceable
regulations.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
well,
i
don't
know
i
think
there
is
partially
relying
on
it
because
the
fha
has
already
subordinated
some
of
its
liens
to
some
state
liens
when
it
didn't
have
to,
hasn't
it?
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
yes.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
the
way
i
read
the
regulations,
the
enabling
act,
the
agency
has
given
the
authority
to
do
specific
things
which
is
to
make
farm
loans
or
operating
loans
and
the
entitle
to
draft
legislation
of
regulations
to
implement
that.
there
is
nothing
in
the
enabling
statute
which
would
give
the
government
the
authority
to
have
a
super
priority.
so
i
would
not
think
that
the
drafting
a
regulations
which
granted
the
government
super
priority
over
mechanics
liens
and
purchase
money
security
interest
and
so
forth
would
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
congressional
agent,
of
the
agencies
power.
we
have
drawn
two
statutory,
two
pieces
of
legislation
to
support
our
position
that
the
first
in
time
rule
should
not
be
extended
one
is
the
uniform
commercial
code
and
the
other
is
the
tax
lien
act
of
1966,
which
is
the
court
indicated
the
in
kimbell
argument
earlier,
eroded
the
basis
for
the
extension
of
the
first
in
time
rule
and
in
fact
makes
a
specific
exception
with
respect
to
mechanics
liens
and
those
who
would
retain
possession
of
personal
property
for
the
purpose
of
asserting
a
repair
lien.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
with
respect
to
federal
tax
claims
alone,
we
contended
in
our
brief
that
the
logical
extension
of
the
first
in
time
rule
would
mean
that
the
government
would
take
superiority
over
purchase
money
security
interest
and
its
reply
brief,
the
government
notes
that
in
analyzing
that
contention
that
the
purchase
money
security
interest
would
fail,
it
relies
upon
the
tax
lien
act
of
1966
and
the
uniform
commercial
code
and
some
tax
revenue
rulings.
importance
of
this
is
that
the
government
turns
to
statute
and
state
law
and
tax
law
to
determine
that
it
may
or
may
not
as
it
chooses
to
do
so
have
a
priority
over
purchase
money
security
interest.
so
the
government
flounders
for
a
basis
for
this
exception
but
it
cannot
be
found.
first
in
time
prevails,
it
has
no
exceptions,
so
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
number
one
not
extend
the
doctrine
in
the
first
instance
and
number
two
to
call
that
an
exception
if
it
is
so
extended
such
as
that
exception
found
in
the
tax
lien
act
but
more
particularly
we
would
wish
that
this
court
apply
the
rule
of
law
that
the
fifth
circuit
apply
that
of
a
federal
common
law
based
upon
commercial
rules.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
well,
the
policy
question
from
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
are
you
putting
certainly
in
the
commercial
business
arena,
certainly
it
is
it
is
certain
and
sure
and
claim
for
the
government
but
it
is
reasonable
to
anticipate
that
people
would
attempt
to
make
an
effort
to
work
within
the
confines
of
the
choate
lien
doctrine
the
first
in
time
rules.
so
if
the
first
in
time
rule
is
expanded,
so
that
the
government
has
a
super
priority
over
after
acquired
liens.
the
private
sector,
well
then
come
in
and
make
an
effort
to
work
with
those
rules.
so
you
have
complexity
on
the
private
level
which
is
of
course
counterbalanced
by
the
uniformity
and
simplicity
on
the
federal
side.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
under
the
ucc
itself
you
would
not.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
under
the
fifth
circuit
rule
you
would
get
uniformity.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
well,
they
will
face
with
the
mechanics
lien
and
the
priority
these
are
the
affected
security
interest
by
the
government
and
they
decided
that
one
question.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
well.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
alex
chalmers
(ph).
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
where
you
go,
there
are
traditional
exceptions
to
a
first
in
time
rule
as
the
lehman
would
know
it,
who
ever
gets
their
first
wins.
some
of
the
exceptions
of
the
purchase
money
security
interest,
others
are
these
statutory
liens
that
state
recognize.
those
are
traditional
in
nature.
so
you
are
talking
about
a
rule
of
the
fifth
circuit
fashioned
to
deal
with
a
very
traditional
kind
of
case,
a
very
normal
kind
of
transaction
on
a
very
local,
low
level
from
the
standpoint
of
the
tax
lien
act
of
1966
they
carved
out
a
similar
exception
for
repairmen
and
for
an
attorney's
lien
and
for
a
perfected
security
purchase,
money
security
interest.
so
you
are
talking
about
exceptions
to
the
time
(inaudible)
first
in
time
rule
and
you
are
talking
about
traditional
exceptions
nothing
unusual
or
esoteric
about
the
mechanics
lien,
it
has
been
around
for
years
especially
one
that
is
possessory
in
nature.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
there
is
the
relationship,
the
concept
of
the
materialman
or
the
mechanic
is
the
he
is
one
who
improves
and
enhances
value
of
property.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
at
least
--
at
least
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
rule
fashioned
in
this
case
provides
protection
for
one
who
says
that
it
does
not
preserve
it.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
there
are.
i
cannot
name
the
states
but
there
are
states
that
do
not
for
example
have
a
statutory
materialman's
lien
in
the
first
instance
or
that
do
not
give
it
priority
to
a
prior
perfected
first
mortgage
and
these
the
similar
situation
is
true
with
respect
to
personal
property
apparently
because
the
government
has
cited
some
and
also
some
13
states,
which
do
not
give
a
super
priority
to
the
repairs
of
a
mechanic.
so
the
rule
would
vary
depending
upon
the
state.
and
its
brief
the
government
seem
to
elevate
the
importance
of
its
lending
programs
to
a
constitutional
level
and
whatever
the
underlying
or
underpinnings
of
the
government
lending
programs
are,
they
are
certainly
different
from
the
functions
that
performs
as
a
taxing
entity
and
the
tax
arena
the
government
is
an
involuntary
creditor
and
the
debtor
is
simply
a
neutral
party.
however
in
a
government
lending
program,
the
government
participates
with,
bargains
with,
considers
with,
talks
with
is
prospective
borrower.
it's
a
voluntary
enterprise
and
it
is
characterized
by
a
commercial
business
dealings.
a
rule,
which
comports
with
commercial
business
dealings
is
one
fashioned
by
the
fifth
circuit.
a
federal
common
law
rule
based
upon
the
uniform
commercial
code
but
the
utilization,
expansion
and
amplification
of
a
first
in
time
rule
which
does
not
comport
with
commercial
expectations
and
as
much
as
it
does
not
recognize
any
exception,
but
is
all
encompassing
and
of
course
in
conjunction
with
the
choate
test
is
one
buying
through
which
as
the
fifth
circuit
said
the
government
always
wins.
so,
the
utilization
of
a
commercial
doctrine
as
opposed
to
one
that
it
does
not
recognize
realities
and
the
practicalities
of
dealing
with
the
business
world
would
be
in
a
more
appropriate
rule
for
this
court
to
fashion
in
the
absence
of
any
congressional
legislation
at
the
contrary.
it's
been
suggested
that
the
government
needs
to
fulfill
a
particular
interest
in
protecting
its
property.
however,
as
the
exceptions
to
the
tax
lien
act
of
1966
reflect
the
attorney's
lien,
the
repairman's
lien,
the
government
is
not
hurt
by
the
recognition
of
exceptions
to
the
first
in
time
rule.
and
so
far
as
a
purchase
money
security
interest
is
concerned,
the
government
never
had
it,
if
the
government
was
not
on
the
scene
the
debtor
would
not
have
had
an
opportunity
to
ever
obtain
additional
collateral.
but,
the
proprietary
interest
that
the
government
has
and
the
debtor's
collateral
and
debtor's
property
is
not
defeated,
divested,
defaced,
eroded
by
the
failure
to
apply
the
first
in
time
rule.
the
government,
in
fact
is
better-off
in
this
case
after
the
tractor
is
repaired
than
before
it
was
repaired.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i
believe
the
district
court
was
correct
and
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
no.
i
think
that
under
georgia
law
it
would
have

yes,
yes
it
would
have
been
subordinated
to
the
mechanics
lien.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
as
i
contend
that
and
i
contend
it
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
and
that's
what
the
district
court
did.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
it

of

that's
true.
mr.

we

that

believe
the
fifth
circuit
rule
where
adopted
the
uniform
commercial
code
with
reference
to
state
law
is
the
appropriate
rule.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
it
did
not
decide
the
whole
case.
in
fact,
the
district
court
held
that
we
had
an
equitable
lien
on
the
tractor.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
it
didn't
feel
compelled
to
reach
that
question
in
light
of
the
view
that
it
was
taking
over
the
case.
and
then
so
far
as
the
georgia
law
is
concerned,
the
fifth
circuit
look
to
see
whether
or
not
a
mechanics
lien
was
available
under
georgia
law
and
determining
that
it
was
made
reference
to
the
uniform
commercial
code,
the
federal
tax
lien
act
the
question
of
complete
and
total
possession
the
fifth
circuit
noted
if
it
find
no
case
on
the
subject
and
we
couldn't
either.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i
believe
that
the
district
court's
decision
with
respect
to
georgia
law
could
be
the
basis
for
this
court
upholding
its
interpretation
of
georgia
law
in
granting
crittenden
the
super
priority
in
this
case.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
need
to
reach
the
question
of
--
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
decide
it
first
of
all
or
second
that
it
need
to
that
it
can
either
remand
it
to
the
fifth
circuit
or
that
it
can
adopt
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
howell
hollis,
iii
i
don't
believe
you
need
to
decide
that.
in
conclusion,
the
choate
lien
test
in
the
first
in
time
rules
transport
at
the
end
of
the
commercial
area
cannot
to
help
to
create
--
i
see
my
time
is
running.
