mr.
barnett,
along
with
what
my
brother
steve
told
about,
you
don't
want
us
--
you
say
that
the
sba
loses
a
lot
of
money.
well,
you
don't
want
us
to
encourage
it
to
lose
more.
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
may
be
doing
that
if
we
tell
them,
do
not
use
normal
choate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
checking
to
see
if
there
is
lien
outstanding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whereas
in
this
case
no
defensible
reason
governed
by
the
state
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
the
last
paragraph
in
the
yazell
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
how
to
argued
with.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
the
time
to
watch
the
state
laws
and
follow
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
drafting
service
provisions,
counsel
should
carefully
consider
the
applicable
laws
of
the
states,
that's
what
this
regulation
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
in
georgia
if
it's
been
private
there
would
be
no
problem
other
than
the
fha,
i
mean
if
it
had
been
a
private
loan
or
private
instrument,
they
would
had
no
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
it
is
clear?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
we
have
to
buy
that
in
order
to
affirm?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
at
issue
here
is
whether
state
or
federal
law
should
be
used
to
establish
a
relative
priority
of
private
items,
private
liens
and
federal
contractual
liens.
the
federal
liens
arise
from
lending
activities
of
the
small
business
administration
and
the
farmers'
own
administration.
these
loan
programs
are
authorized
by
a
statute
that
do
not,
in
any
ways,
specify
priority
rules
to
govern
such
liens.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
government's
argument
that
the
rules
developed
by
this
court
for
determining
the
priority
of
federal
tax
liens
should
also
apply
when
the
united
states
acts
as
a
commercial
lender.
instead,
it
fashioned
a
special
federal
rule
based
largely
on
the
model,
uniform
commercial
code.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
choice
of
law
for
assessing
the
priority
of
these
competing
liens
is
federal.
however,
a
national
rule
is
unnecessary
in
order
to
protect
federal
interest
underlying
the
loan
programs.
accordingly,
we
adopt
the
state
commercial
law
as
the
appropriate
federal
rule
of
decision,
leaving
congress
free
to
establish
uniform
priority
rules
through
legislation.
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
number
1359
found
that
the
texas
law
gave
the
private
lien
preference
over
the
federal
lien,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
remand
16044
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
private
or
federal
lien
involved
in
that
case
is
superior
under
georgia
law.
