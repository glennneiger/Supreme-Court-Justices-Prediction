mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
well,
it
may
not
have
seen
readily
apparent
from
the
government's
abbreviated
statement
of
the
issue
presented
in
this
case.
this
isn't
simply
a
case
of
a
choate
federal
lien
versus
an
inchoate
private
lien.
this
case
is
entirely
different
from
any
other
cases
on
which
the
government
relies.
the
two
competing
liens
that
you
have
in
this
case
were
both
created
and
perfected
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
of
the
state
of
texas
in
favor
of
private
lenders.
this
wasn't
a
government
lien
from
the
inception,
one
lien
the
first
lien
was
created
in
favor
of
kimbell
foods.
it
was
perfected
in
1966
and
1968
long
before,
the
second
party
republic
national
bank
acquired
its
security
interest
much
less
had
it
perfected
and
at
least
two
years
prior
to
the
time
that
the
sba
purchased
an
undivided
90%
interest.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
yes,
based
on
united
states
versus
vermont.
what
the
sba
is
arguing
in
this
case
is
that
in
1961
five
years
after
kimbell
perfected
its
lien
when
it
purchased
its
90%
interest
in
the
republic
national
bank
security
interest
that
invested
that
republic
national
bank
security
interest
with
federal
lien
rights
and
sovereign
prerogatives,
which
related
all
the
way
back
to
when
the
lien
was
first
taken
by
the
republic
national
bank
and
by
applying
the
choateness
test
at
that
point
in
time
bootstraps
the
republic
national
bank
security
interest
into
a
first
position.
the
fifth
circuit
rejected
that
logic
and
refused
to
extend
the
choate
lien
test
into
this
kind
of
situation.
now,
when
i
was
reviewing
this
court's
opinions
in
united
states
versus
city
of
new
britain
and
united
states
versus
vermont,
i
realized
that
i
had
missed
a
very
basic
point
in
briefing
the
situation
for
kimbell.
in
united
states
versus
city
of
new
britain,
in
that
case
you
had
competing
local
water
rent
liens
and
local
tax
liens
competing
with
the
federal
tax
lien.
the
court
there
laid
down
the
basic
rule
that
in
determining
what
is
first
in
time
and
therefore
first
in
right
you
must
determine
which
lien
attached
first
and
which
lien
became
choate.
it
didn't
say
that
that
test
only
applied
to
the
private
lien
and
not
the
government
lien.
so,
then
you
come
to
the
united
states
versus
vermont,
unanimous
decision
by
this
court,
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
that
case,
the
two
liens
you
had
competing
with
each
other
was
a
federal
tax
lien
and
a
vermont
tax
lien,
which
arose
under
a
statute
that
was
patterned
after
the
federal
tax
lien
and
whose
reading
was
identical.
the
vermont
tax
lien
had
been
assisted
first,
the
federal
lien
some
months
later.
the
government
in
that
case
argued
that
the
vermont
lien
was
inchoate
and
urged
that
a
different
standard
of
choateness
be
applied
to
the
state
lien
than
to
the
government
lien.
will
this
court
rejected
that?
both
liens
rose
under
identical
statutes
and
this
court
held
the
vermont
lien
first
in
time
and
prior
in
right.
the
basis
of
the
vermont
case
essentially
is
this;
when
you
have
two
competing
liens,
which
arise
under
the
same
statute
such
as
we
have
here
are
substantially
identical
statutes,
the
reasonable
rule
is
to
look
to
the
statute
for
priority
and
that's
uniform.
i
submit
that
this
court
can
dispose
off
this
case
in
favor
of
kimbell
just
by
reiterating
that
the
federal
common
law
rule
is
that
with
the
liens
arise
under
the
same
statute
are
under
substantially
identical
statutes,
you
look
to
the
statue
for
priority.
that's
uniform,
that's
non-discriminatory
and
unquestionably
just.
that
point
is
not
specifically
covered
in
that
brief
and
neither
is
the
point
was
in
relation
to
some
subsequent
congressional
action.
after
the
brief
--
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
yes.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
the
basic
proposition,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
it
is
that
it
is
federal
law
governs
but
when
the
sba
enters
into
a
field
of
consensual
loans,
it
should
be
governed
by
the
same
law
as
all
the
rest
of
these
cases.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
it
should
be.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
it
would
have
arose
under
texas
law.
it
would
have
its
security
agreement,
it
would
have
perfected
it
under
texas
law.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
because
the
sba
when
they
make
these
kinds
of
loans
--
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
i
think
yes,
i
think
and
i'm
not
positive
on
that,
but
i
think
the
sba
statute
says
that
the
lien
shall
be
recorded
and
perfected
in
accordance
with
state
law.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
i
think
so.
i
know
that
they
do
and
i
know
that
the
sba
congress
has
admonished
the
sba
to
make
--
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
well,
i
think
that
the
regulations
may
direct
the
sba
offices
to
file
their
liens
in
accordance
with
state
law,
perhaps
so
government
can
--
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
i
would
be
happy
to
look
it
up
and
submit
something
to
this
court
on
that
with
your
--
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
yes,
but
with
relation
to
the
--
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
i
will
try.
the
question
came
up
what
standard
is
supposed
to
be
applied
by
the
sba
in
making
loans?
are
they
expected
to
have
great
losses?
congress
has
admonished
the
sba
to
make
only
loans
of
such
sound
value
or
so
secured
as
to
reasonably
assure
repayment.
it
is
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
yazell.
sba
activity
is
very
localized,
it
is
done
by
local
offices
and
by
agents
who
are
experienced
in
the
law
of
those
localities
but
just
before
lunch,
i
want
to
point
out
one
of
the
piece
of
legislation
the
fifth
circuit
in
refusing
to
extend
the
choateness
rule
to
this
area
look
to,
reconnect
of
congress
is
a
barometer
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
commercial
world
and
also
what
federal
intent
was
with
relation
to
federal
priority.
and
that
referred
to
the
tax
lien
act
of
1966,
which
abolished
a
lot
of
the
priorities
established
by
the
choateness
rule.
well,
after
the
brief
was
filed
in
this
case
in
november
of
last
year,
there
was
enacted
the
new
bankruptcy
act,
which
goes
into
effect
for
the
most
part
in
october
of
1978.
in
that
bankruptcy
act,
congress
has
done
away
completely
without
federal
priority
except
for
taxes
accruing
within
three
years
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
the
old
subsection
64
(a)(5)
giving
the
federal
government
priority
for
non-tax
debts
has
been
abolished.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
no
sir.
this
is
not
a
bankruptcy
case.
i
refer
to
that
merely
as
an
indicator
of
governmental
policy
on
federal
priority
status.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
no,
it
does
not
answer
those
questions.
i
just
referred
to
what
is
an
indicator
that
the
priority,
the
super
priority,
which
has
been
furnished
to
the
government
in
previous
cases,
has
been
done
away
with
and
does
not
carry
the
same
import
that
it
did
previously.
i'll
resume
after
lunch.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
during
the
lunch
hour,
i
did
run
up
to
the
library
and
attempt
to
find
the
basis
for
my
belief
that
sba
loans
are
perfected
in
accordance
with
state
law.
i
knew
that
i
had
seen
it
somewhere
and
i
knew
that
they
did
it.
what
i
did
finally
remember
was
that
in
the
united
states
versus
yazell,
which
is
an
sba
case
arising
out
of
texas,
this
court
in
that
case
said
there
is
no
problem
in
complying
with
state
law
in
fact
sba
transactions
in
each
state
are
specifically
and
in
great
detail
adapted
the
state
law
and
it
refers
to
note
35.
note
35
is
the
financial
assistance
manual
of
the
small
business
administration,
sba
500
is
replete
with
admonitions
to
follow
state
law
carefully.
thus
section
401.03
reads
compliance
with
applicable
laws.
when
the
united
states
disperses
funds
and
is
exercising
a
constitutional
functional
power
and
its
rights
and
duties
are
governed
by
federal
rather
than
local
law.
however,
it
is
frequently
necessary
in
the
obtaining
of
a
marketable
title
or
enforceable
security
interest
and
property
to
follow
local
procedural
requirements
and
statutes.
accordingly,
care
should
be
used
in
following
or
meeting
all
applicable
requirements
in
statutes
of
the
state
in
which
the
property
is
located
including
the
filing
and
refiling,
recording
and
rerecording
of
any
documents
and
then
to
--
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
yes,
it's
the
financial
assistance
manual
of
the
small
business
administration.
in
the
short
time
that
i
had
that
was
the
best
that
i
could
up
with.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
thank
you.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
yes.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
that's
exactly
our
position
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
yes.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
in
their
brief
and
in
the
argument,
the
government
here
strongly
insist
that
there
is
a
coherent,
well-established,
well-understood
body
of
president
that
would
establish
that
the
choateness
rule
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
and
therefore
urges
this
court
to
not
deviate
from
that
rule
but
extend
it
into
this
new
field
of
consensual
security
interest
under
uniform
commercial
code.
first
of
all,
such
contention
is
not
well
taken.
there
exists
no
such
coherent,
well-established,
well-understood
body
of
president.
this
court
has
never
extended
the
choate
lien
test
rule
outside
the
context
of
the
federal
insolvency
statute
or
the
federal
tax
lien
act.
in
both
of
those
fields,
congress
has
greatly
reduced
federal
priority.
this
court
has
never
held
in
any
case
that
the
choate
lien
test
applies
to
a
consensual
security
interest
held
or
acquired
by
the
government.
neither
this
court
or
any
lower
court
has
ever
held
a
choateness
test
that
applicable
in
a
case
involving
a
federal
consensual
lien
versus
a
private
consensual
lien,
a
federal
security
interest
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
versus
a
private
security
interest
under
the
uniform
commercial
code.
there
has
been
no
extension
of
that
choate
lien
test
into
this
area.
consequently,
there
is
no
evil
for
the
government
to
correct
by
legislation,
they
are
just
this
field
has
not
been
covered.
the
five
circuit
court
of
appeals
cases
relied
on
by
the
government
is
establishing
this
president
at
the
time
the
transactions
were
entered
into,
all
involve
a
competing
statutory
special
interest
lien
created
by
a
state
statute,
which
either
grants
that
lien
super
priority
or
relates
it
back
to
a
point
in
time
that
has
no
reasonable
connection
with
the
establishment
of
the
lien.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
the
choateness
rule
was
developed
primarily
to
prevent
the
special
interest
lien
creditors
from
getting
their
leg
up
on
the
government
in
the
collecting
of
its
taxes
in
the
exercise
of
a
sovereign
power.
now
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
take
the
choate
lien
test
and
relate
it
back
and
give
the
government
a
leg
up
on
the
private
lender
and
it's
not
required.
what
they
are
attempting
to
do
is
to
perpetrate
a
reverse
evil
that
the
choateness
rule
was
originally
fashioned
by
this
court
to
prevent.
such
coherent,
well-established
body
of
president
was
not
even
well
understood
by
the
attorneys
and
the
representatives
of
the
government
and
the
sba
at
the
beginning
of
this
case.
and
the
government's
answer
to
kimbell's
complaint
and
then
the
detailed
pre-trial
agreement
that
was
filed
with
the
court
absolutely
no
mention
whatsoever
is
made
of
choateness.
no
issue
is
reserved
as
to
whether
or
not
kimbell's
lien
is
choate.
during
the
trial
with
this
case
counsel
for
the
government
stood
up
and
announced
to
the
trail
court
that
its
position
was
the
same
as
the
republic
national
banks.
the
primary
line
of
defense
had
nothing
to
do
with
choateness
or
federal
super
priority.
it
was
one
kimbell
had
either
expressly
or
implyably
agreed
that
its
lien
would
be
inferior
to
the
lien
of
the
republic
national
bank
or
number
two
that
under
applicable
state
law,
future
advances
were
not
covered
under
the
security
agreement.
that
was
rejected
by
the
fifth
circuit,
is
not
here
before
the
court.
it
was
not
until
after
the
case
was
actually
tried
and
briefs
were
submitted
to
trail
court
that
the
issue
of
choateness
was
ever
raised.
so,
if
it
was
such
a
well
established,
well
understood
body
of
president,
why
did
it
appear
in
the
case
so
late?
i
think
the
law
review
articles
that
had
been
written
by
the
authorities
with
relation
to
the
choateness
rule
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
a
clear
body
of
law.
even
counsel
in
this
case
is
somewhat
unclear
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
a
choate
lien.
in
the
original
brief,
he
took
the
position
that
kimbell's
lien
could
not
be
choate
because
it
was
not
reduced
to
judgment.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
say,
what
your
honor?
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
yes,
yes
and
what?
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
yeah
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
fashion
a
federal
rule
that
is
a
little
bit
clear
at
least
clear
and
fair
than
the
choateness
test.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
alright,
the
word
is
fighting
with
me
your
honor.
even
the
government
doesn't
know
when
a
lien
is
choate.
they
say,
there
is
a
big
difference
between
a
security
interest
that
secures
a
debt
owing
on
a
promissory
note,
which
it
now
says
it
maybe
choate
because
of
its
concession
made
into
the
crest
finance
case
but
that
doesn't
apply
where
the
debt
is
secured
by
an
open
account.
it
says
if
you
have
got
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
it's
a
promissory
note
that's
good
it's
choate.
if
your
pieces
of
paper
are
invoices
submitted
on
a
weekly
basis
plus
statements
of
account,
they
say
that's
not
good,
that's
inchoate.
and
why
do
they
say
that,
they
say
that
because
there
are
many
challenges
that
a
creditor
who
purchases
goods
on
open
account
can
make
and
therefore
there
are
many
contingencies
and
until
it's
reduced
to
judgment,
it
can't
be
choate.
but
that's
what
a
specious
reasoning,
the
same
applies
to
a
promissory
note
in
the
crest
case,
you
had
a
series
of
promissory
notes.
payments
have
been
made
on
those
notes,
additional
interest
had
accrued.
the
debt
secured
was
not
the
face
of
the
promissory
note,
you
had
to
go
to
the
books
and
records
of
the
government
and
you
had
to
go
to
the
books
and
records
of
the
finance
company
to
determine
what
the
balance
outstanding
was
on
any
given
day.
and
anybody
who
has
tried
a
case
on
a
promissory
note
knows
that
ingenious
counsel
can
come
up
with
as
many
defenses
to
suite
for
the
balance
of
a
promissory
note
as
he
can
for
a
suite
based
on
an
account.
so,
if
a
suite
we
submit
your
honor
that
if
a
security
interest
securing
the
balance
on
promissory
notes
is
not
choate
so
also
should
be
held
for
the
purpose
of
choateness
in
this
area
if
it
applies
is
the
balance
owing
on
an
open
account.
even
t
any
given
point
in
time,
you
can
determine
the
amount
of
the
lien,
the
property
to
which
it
attaches
the
name
of
the
secured
party
and
the
name
of
the
debtor.
the
other
point
with
relation
to
security
interest
under
the
code
is
that
some
of
the
cases
that
indicated
that
a
lien
will
be
"if
it's
enforceable
by
summary
proceedings,
it
is
to
be
noted
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
that
upon
default,
a
security
interest
can
be
enforced
by
summary
proceedings.
the
creditor
goes
up,
picks
up
the
property
and
sells
it,
no
judicial
action
is
required.
the
government
argues
that
what
we
really
need
to
do
here
is
take
a
rule
that
will
give
us
this
stability
and
certainty
so
that
people
who
are
engaged
in
commercial
lending
will
know
where
they
stand.
and
they
say
that
we
can
get
that
way
through
the
choate
lien
test.
now
we
submit
that
is
not
correct.
if
you
take
their
argument
that
a
lien
becomes
--
that
a
private
lien
becomes
a
federal
lien
when
it's
acquired
by
the
government
and
it
relates
all
the
way
back
to
when
it
was
first
created
and
then
you
will
apply
the
choateness
test
there,
which
you
have
is
uncertainty
foretold.
first
of
all,
the
man
who
makes
a
loan
or
who
is
extending
credit,
first
he
will
not
know
if
the
government
will
ever
come
in
and
guarantee
a
loan,
insure
a
loan
or
buy
somebody's
loan
or
get
a
direct
loan
sometime
in
the
future
three
or
four
years.
if
the
government
does
come
in
and
acquire
a
loan
some
years
in
advance
then
that
creditor
will
not
know
to
what
date
that
lien
relates
back
because
there
is
absolutely
nothing
that
requires
the
recordation
of
a
government
guarantee
or
a
government
security
interest
even
after
the
government
acquires
it,
nothing
need
really
be
filed
off
record.
and
as
far
as
the
commercial
community
is
concerned,
there
is
absolutely
no
notice
to
anybody
that
there
maybe
a
federal
lien
floating
out
there
somewhere.
the
other
uncertainty,
the
third
uncertainty
is
to
what
collateral
will
a
federal
lien
attach
when
it
relates
back?
property
is
sold,
a
lot
of
people
have
shipped
in
additional
merchandize
to
the
debtor
like
kimbell
did
in
this
case,
kimbell's
security
interest
is
a
purchase
money
security
interest.
it
secures
the
payment
price
of
merchandize,
which
kimbell
actually
shipped
in,
if
the
lien
relates
back
prior
to
that
time
and
kimbell's
lien
is
no
good
that's
an
uncertainty.
and
the
other
uncertainty
would
be
the
amount
of
the
debt
that
would
be
secured
at
the
time
the
federal
lien
was
given
effect.
the
amounts
balance
if
the
loan
was
originally
$300,000
it
could
be
down
to
20,
if
it
were
originally
300
and
it
had
future
advances,
clauses
that
could
go
up
to
600.
too
much
uncertainty
would
be
created
by
applying
the
choateness
rule
in
this
concept
of
consensual
liens.
the
performance
of
a
proprietary
or
a
commercial
function
by
the
government
is
distinguished
from
a
sovereign
function
such
as
collecting
taxes.
you
just
wouldn't
know
where
you
stood.
now,
they
make
an
argument
in
their
brief
that,
this
will
not
create
any
economic
adverse
effects
on
private
loans
to
small
businesses.
now,
common
sense
and
experience
tells
every
one
of
us
that
whether
you
are
loaning
money
or
selling
product,
if
a
private
lender
sells
to
a
specific
portion
of
a
market
and
loses
money,
one
or
two
things
is
going
to
happen.
he
is
either
going
to
increase
the
cost
of
that
service
to
the
customer
or
he
is
going
to
curtail
doing
business
in
that
segment
of
the
economy.
the
government
has
intimated
that
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
priority
rules
that
have
been
incorporated
by
congress
in
the
tax
lien
act
of
1966
that
kimbell
would
lose
because
the
advances
were
made
more
than
45
days
after
the
federal
lien,
well,
that
argument
is
based
on
the
premises
that
the
federal
lien
was
filed
when
it
was
originally
filed
in
favor
of
republic
national
bank.
we
submit
that
at
that
time
it
was
not
a
federal
lien
under
the
decision
of
this
case
in
markson
and
there
is
no
debt
do
an
owing
to
the
government.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
naming
the
sba?
nothing
naming
the
sba.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
he
would
have
to
search
the
records
daily.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
in
the
case
of
the
uniform
commercial
code,
he
could
search
the
record
--
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
it
need
not.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
it
does.
in
this
case,
it
did.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
when
it
acquired
undivided
90%
interest
in
republic
loan
in
1971
on
i
believe
it
was
january
18th
or
28th
the
later
part
of
january
71.
it
filed
a
ucc-3,
which
is
an
assignment
statement
with
the
secretarial
state
of
texas.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
well,
the
reason
you
file
those
kind
of
things
your
honor
is.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
well,
they
may
not
have
trusted
republic
national
bank
after
their
initial
encounter
in
this
case
and
didn't
want
republic
national
bank
to
be
put
in
a
position
to
either
release
or
prejudice
that
lien.
the
reason
you
file
a
ucc-3
is
to
prevent
the
original
secured
party
from
doing
anything
that
would
affect
the
assignee's
rights.
the
ucc-3
doesn't
create
any
rights,
it
is
purely
a
notice
instrument.
now,
in
this
case
the
sba
--
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
it
needn't
have
because
it
did.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
yes.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
right
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
to
kimbell
in
this
case.
kimbell
wrapped
along
that
they
were
owed
$18,000
when
the
republic
lien
was
created
and
at
the
end
of
the
road
they
were
still
owed
$18,000,
there
was
no
big
increase
or
decrease
in
the
amount
of
debt
that
was
secured.
but
mr.
justice
white
you
are
perfectly
right.
there
is
no
way
that
a
private
lender
out
there
making
a
loan
feeling
that
he
is
first
insecure
can
ever
know
that
five
years
later,
the
government
is
going
to
come
in
and
assert
some
rights,
relate
them
back
and
make
themselves
superior
to
his
lien.
mr.
vernon
o.
teofan
okay,
supermarket
your
honor
was
the
debtor,
it
is
not
an
insolvent.
insolvency
is
not
a
issue
in
this
case
neither
is
bankruptcy,
neither
a
federal
tax
loans.
thank
you
very
much.
