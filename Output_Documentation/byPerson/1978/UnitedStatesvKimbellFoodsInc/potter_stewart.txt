justice
potter
stewart
mr.
barnett,
at
what
way
does
that
argument
cut?
what
you
are
saying
i
suppose
is
the
government
is
willing
to
take
greater
risks
in
lending
than
private
lenders
do.
so,
why
should
have
then
the
greater
protection?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
it
takes
security
that
would
not
be
sufficient
to
induce
a
commercial
lender
to
advance
the
fund.
so,
then
just
it
starts
from
the
promise
that
it
is
willing
to
take
some
additional
risks.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no
with
the
rule
i
suppose
would
be
that
it
has
to
follow
the
same
precautionary
procedures
that
any
other
lender
has
to
follow,
have
to
search
the
title
and
if
it
is
searched
here,
it
would
have
found
there
was
a
perfected
lien
--
justice
potter
stewart
yeah
but
the
difference
there
is
i
understand
it
is
that
the
government
has
no
way
of
protecting
itself
from
the
tax
case,
he
doesnt
know
who
is
going
to
fail
to
pay
his
taxes.
but
here
before
they
advance
the
money,
they
cant
go
out,
make
a
title
research
like
any
other
lender
can.
why
shouldnt
they
have
that
obligation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
just
told
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
asking
us
to
extend
that
rule
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suggest
you
they
are
not
equally
applicable
because
in
one
case
the
government
can
check
title
and
in
the
other
case
it
cant.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
justification
for
rather
different
approach
to
the
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
sba
make
direct
loans
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
what
law
do
you
suppose
it
the
lien
that
arises,
when
it
makes
a
direct
loan?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
in
this
case,
it
was
a
direct
loan
by
the
sba.
justice
potter
stewart
and
let's
assume
that
it
had
been
under
what
law
would
the
lien
arise?
justice
potter
stewart
what
makes
you
think
so?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
the
statute
said
it
should
be
perfected
when
the
money
is
paid
out,
it
would
be
perfected
with
that.
does
the
statute
indicate
that
the
sba
should
follow
the
state
law
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
rather
important
in
that
if
we
would
argue,
if
that
were
true
in
this
case
that
congress
certainly
intended
to
accommodate
the
laws
of
each
individual
state.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
it
seems
--
sounds
to
me
like
a
rather
substantial
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe,
mr.
barnett,
will
have
something
to
say
in
response.
justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
you
dint
say
crafted,
but
it's
the
word
that
you
use
before.
justice
potter
stewart
to
look
to
state
law,
to
look
to
state,
to
not
to
look
to
non-uniform
state
law,
so
that
people
operating
in
that
commercial
market
will
know
where
they
are.
justice
potter
stewart
are
tractors
like
automobiles,
passenger
automobiles,
is
there
artificial
obsolescence.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
reason
i
asked
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
choateness
really
isn't
an
issue
here,
the
lien
simply
didn't
exist
choate
or
un-choate
until
later?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
decide
in
this
case
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court
stating
federal
to
apply
state
law
for
example
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
whatever
the
duty
was
to
apply
state
law
then
the
fha
could
hardly
come
out
with
regulations
since
to
the
effect
the
state
law
would
be
disregarded,
could
it?
justice
potter
stewart
quite
and
defines
of
what
might
be
decided
in
this
case
by
this
case,
that's
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
this
court
should
decide
in
this
case
and
its
predecessor
that
what
is
applicable
is
the
body
of
state
substantive
law
in
this
area,
whatever
the
state
might
be
of
all
--
each
of
the
50s
wherever
the
transaction
is
made.
could
the
fha
in
this
case
and
the
sba
in
the
previous
case
then
come
out
with
rules
or
regulations
saying
that
state
law
shall
be
wholly
disregarded
and
that
our
liens
show,
have
this
or
that
in
the
other
priority
regardless
of
the
provisions
of
state
law,
i'm
just
referring
in
order
to
my
brother
white's
question.
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
shows
inconsistent
with
whatever
the
court
says
in
these
two
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
first
in
time
rule
is
applicable
it
has.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
it's
quite
apart
from
differing
constructions
of
the
ucc
by
the
various
state
courts
you
have
in
this
context
the
ucc
itself
gives
this
super
seniority
to
mechanics
liens
of
this
type
unless
the
lien
is
created
by
state
law
and
unless
that
state
law
provides
that
there
should
be
no
super
seniority
and
were
told
to
some
10
to
30
states
don't
give
super
seniority,
so
you
wouldn't
get
anything
likes
uniformity
in
this
area,
wouldn't
you
under
the
ucc
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
he
would
get
defers
to
state
loan
in
this
respect.
justice
potter
stewart
could
i
make
sure
did
you
say
earlier
you
sought
the
district
court
was
right
on
georgia
law?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
you
think
under
georgia
law
this
lender,
if
the
fha
had
been
a
private
lender
having
perfected
its
lien
the
way
it
was
perfected
here.
it
would
have
been
subordinate
to
the
mechanics
lien.
justice
potter
stewart
not
only
for
the
last
bill
but
all
of
them.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
not
what
the
district
court
did?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
think
that's
consistent
with
georgian
law?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
district
court
so
find
with
respect
to
the
first
six
repair
jobs?
justice
potter
stewart
entire
but
you
are
no
longer
asking,
i
mean
you
are
just
trying
to
defend
the
last
$400
as
i
remember.
could
you
have
any
cross
petitioned?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
you
do
not
know
i
have
a
claim
for
the
first
five
repair
bills,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
remove
the
matter
from
congressional
reach
or
from
agency
reach
if
congress
gave
the
agency
the
regulatory
authority.
