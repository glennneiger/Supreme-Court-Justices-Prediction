justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnett,
would
it
be
an
equally
appropriate
phrasing
of
the
question
to
say
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
government
requests
that
this
court
extend
the
choateness
doctrine
that
is
previously
applied
in
tax
areas
to
non-tax
activities
of
the
federal
government
to
give
it
priority
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
fifth
circuits
decision
in
this
case
was
the
violation
of
the
first
in
time,
first
in
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
previously
been
applied
by
this
court
only
in
the
tax
area.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
are
asking
us
to
extend
it
in
this
case
from
the
tax
area
to
the
field
of
commercial
lending.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
government
expect
to
lose
some
money
on
its
sba
loan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
or
whether
this
court
should
confine
the
rule
to
the
tax
area
where
it
now
let
congress
determine
whether
it
should
be
extended
further?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
government
in
theory
at
least
so
far
as
the
statutes
are
concerned,
expect
to
collect
all
its
taxes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
would
disagree
with
apparently
both
my
brother
white
and
you
mr.
barnett.
i
would
think
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
can
be
justified
on
the
base
of
following
the
law
of
texas.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
but
that
it
was
followed
not
because
the
ucc
was
in
existence
in
49
states,
but
because
this
particular
federal
question
of
lien
priority
should
be
determined
by
reference
to
state
law
of
the
federal
rule.
it's
a
federal
rule,
but
it
can
be
a
reference
to
state
law
rather
than
to
ucc.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
household
finance
does
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
they
greater
there
than
in
this
case
because
in
crittenden
as
i
understand
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
we
don't
know
what
the
georgia
law
was,
but
here
i
thought
that
judge
gee
was
quite
clear
as
to
what
the
law
of
texas
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
certainly
don't
read
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case
is
saying
that
in
kimbell
foods.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
household
finance
managers
in
all
50
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
saying
there
is
a
need,
not
that
the
government
sovern
but
that
the
government
needs
it
because
of
some
peculiar
difficulties
of
operating
in
all
50
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
have
retroactive
effect
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
get
to
how
a
government
priority
is
to
be
established.
it
didn't
do
away
with
priority
for
example
that
the
government
would
have
under
a
perfected
lien
in
bankruptcy
did
it
and
it
didn't
answer
how
but
to
what
law
would
you
look
to
determine
whether
the
lien
is
perfected?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
you
could
say
that
by
lots
of
groups
of
decisions
in
this
court
currently
in
other
fields
of
the
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
it
isn't
all
that
clear.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
kimbell
is
not
an
insolvent
in
this
case.
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why,
the
lien
is
a
reason
under
federal
law?
you
tell
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnett,
the
second
sentence
of
that
footnote
35
from
the
yazell
case,
which
you
just
read
however
it
is
frequently
necessary
in
the
(inaudible)
of
a
market
rule
title
or
enforceable
security
interest
and
property
to
follow
local
procedural
requirements
and
statutes.
now
what
do
you
take
it,
what
does
that
carve
out
from
the
general
federal
principle
that
you
are
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
says
that's
frequently
necessary
to
obtain
an
enforceable
security
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
indian
towing
arose
on
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fifth
circuit
also
rejected
the
principle
that
federal
law
would
refer
to
state
law
in
this
case,
didn't
they?
didn't
they
say,
we
don't
have
to
cite
what
georgia
law
is
in
this
case
because
we
are
going
to
follow
a
general
common
law
with
ucc
principle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
the
reference
would
be
the
georgia
law
in
this
case.
does
the
government
agree
that
judge
elliott's
opinion
that
district
court
or
does
the
government
think
it
should
be
sent
back
for
a
consideration
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
as
to
what
georgia
law
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
fha
here
at
foreclose,
or
its
during
the
shoes
of
the
tractor
owner
and
the
tractor
was
being
held
by
the
repair
people
pursuant
to
the
mechanics
lien
and
the
only
claim
made
was
the
amount
owed
for
that
particular
repair
by
the
eighth
time.
do
you
think
that
the
fha
could
have
gotten
the
writ
of
replevin
or
something
that
enforce
the
tractor
owner
to
surrender
--
the
repairmen
to
surrender
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
state
courts
also
frequently
differ
in
their
interpretations
of
provisions
with
the
ucc?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
need
the
transposition
of
choateness
from
the
tax
insolvency
field
under
the
commercial
loan
field
in
this
case
to
win
for
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
first
in
time
rule
was
applied
by
courts
long
before
the
term
choate
was
claimed,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
go
back
to
1827
to
the
case
that
applied
the
first
in
time,
first
in
right
rule
as
the
federal
rule.
the
court
adopted
it
wasn't
creating
a
federal
rule,
it
was
just
adopting
what
it
thought
was
the
common
law
rule
was
not
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
aren't
there
two
different
questions.
one
is
whether
it
is
a
federal
question
as
to
the
priority
of
the
lien
and
another
question
is
conceding
that
it
is
a
federal
question
does
the
court
deciding
that
federal
question
referred
to
a
body
of
state
law,
to
a
body
of
federal
common
law
or
to
some
other
body
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not
unless
we
put
our
decision
on
a
constitutional
basis
saying
that
this
is
the
only
way
the
government
can
run
its
business
is
constitutionally
is
by
following
state
law
but
its
never
--
non
of
our
cases
ever
suggested
that
first
in
time
rule
and
choateness
was
a
constitutionally
with
it
and
it
just
been
a
sort
of
a
federal
common
law
that
congress
is
perfectly
free
to
preempt
and
supercede
and
similarly
i
suppose
one
of
its
agencies
if
it
was
authorized
by
a
statute
to
do
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
case,
you
feel
like
an
innocent
bystander,
do
you
agree
with
the
implication
contained
in
my
brother
steven's
question
that
the
agency
would
have
either
employed
or
expressed
authority
under
the
statute
to
draft
the
regulations
which
my
brother
white
has
referred
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
there
some
problems
mr.
hollies
with
if
you
apply
a
federal
common
law
presumably
the
reason
that
you
are
doing
it
as
to
achieve
some
sort
of
certainty
and
yet
if
you
resort
to
the
ucc
as
interpreted
by
the
states,
you
run
into
quite
a
variety
of
interpretations
of
some
provisions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
know
where
the
fifth
circuit
is
going
from
one
case
to
another
under
judge
goldberg's
opinion,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
where
do
we
go
next?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
john
(inaudible).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
somebody
name
jack
crittenberg
is
the
mechanic.
