justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
barnett,
would
not
that
if
they
check,
it
would
have
required
that
the
other
lien
be
waived.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
lender
to
do,
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that's
highly
unlikely
on
these
facts,
don't
you
think,
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
have
the
outstanding
indebtedness
they
could
have
easily
said
to
cancel
your
outstanding
lien
and
it
gets
really
very
unrealistic
to
assume
that
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
clean
it
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
ask
for
an
additional
security
like
any
outstanding
balance,
i
think
that's
highly
unrealistic.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
they
demanding,
they
just
did
not
talk
about
it.
as
i
understand
that
footnote
and
the
opinion
that
they
didn't
really
have
a
very
sophisticated
understanding
in
what
was
going
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
not.
that
they
surely,
the
government
surely
could
have
said
we
are
going
to
give
you
$300,000
we
want
to
use
$20,000
to
pay
off
the
existing
indebtedness,
which
they
did
and
we
also
want
you
to
terminate
that
perfected
lien
and
i'm
sure
that
will
happen,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
we
are
going
to
turn
down
that
$300,000
because
we
may
need
to
borrow
$5,000
in
the
future,
that
is
very
outstanding.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
rule
you
want
mr.
barnett
which
you
defend
certainly
gives
the
government
more
protection
than
the
tax
lien
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
importantly
more
not
only
in
right
across
the
board
expect
with
respect
to
this
future
advances.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
can
i
ask
you
another
--
shoot
a
question,
if
a
private
lender
had
made
this
same
loan
that
the
sba
did
in
the
face
of
an
inventory
financings
scheme,
how
would
the
private
lender
have
come
out
on
these
facts
under
the
uniform
commercial
code.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
would
have
under
the
uniform
commercial
code,
if
a
perfected
inventory
arrangement
calling
for
future
advances
would
take
precedence
over
a
later
perfected
mortgage?
justice
byron
r.
white
later
perfected
mortgage.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
so
that
the
private
lender,
if
he
had
to
lend
under
these
conditions
here
would
have
been
on
notice
that
there
would
be
future
advances
and
he
would
take
subordinate
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
is
that
a
rule
in
some
all
the
states
under
state
law
or
is
it
49
states
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
says
they
i
suppose
if
the
question
is,
is
it
of
course
federal
law
applies
here,
the
question
is
from
what
sources
do
you
draw
the
federal
law
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
just
take
the
tax
lien
law
and
apply
it
but
you
don't
want
the
tax
lien
law
because
that's
now
been
replaced
by
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
calling
it
common
law
does
not
give
it
any
greater
or
less
substance.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
it's
a
federal
rule
that
was
crafted
in
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
question
is
now
in
the
ordinary
commercial
settings,
what
source
should
have
be
drawn?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
comparison
with
some
area
that
congress
is
already
discarded,
i
mean
the
rule
for
tax
liens,
congress
has
already
put
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
it
supposed
to,
what
does
the
congress
did
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
now
look
to
the
statute
not
to
our
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
that
is
the
choice.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
in
that
respect,
if
you
just
follow
the
law
of
each
state
at
least
you
might
have
some
common
understanding
in
the
state
what
the
rule
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
principle
is
that?
that's
the
question
in
this
case.
one
of
the
questions
in
this
case
whether
to
have
a
uniform
rule
and
why
shouldn't
the
sba
in
operating
in
various
states
as
a
lender
act
any
other
lender?
why
should
somebody
a
bank
furnishing
inventory
financing
have
to
say
well,
i
guess
we
are
good
against
every
kind
of
a
lender
except
the
federal
government
with
the
sba?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
is
bootstrapping.
you
do
not
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
taxes.
that's
a
distinctive
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
it
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
need
is
that,
i
don't
see
understand
that
need?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
obeys
the
speed
limits
where
it's
employees
in
every
state,
it
doesn't
want
it
national
speed
limit?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
yet,
not
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
yet
in
this
commercial
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
state
or
rather
a
sba
regulation
with
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
what
the
sba
practice
is
when
they
buy
a
participation
in
the
loan,
is
there
any
filing
done
under
the
state
law
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
any
lender
ever
discover
that
to
what
he
thought
was
a
good
lien
against
the
republic
national
was
now
no
longer
good
lien
because
the
government
has
bought
part
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
i
just
asked
you
would
the
sba
do
any
filing
whatsoever
when
it
bought
into
the
republic
loan.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
or
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did.
it
filed
under
state
law.
why
did
it
file?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
why
did
it
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
the
reason
private
people
did,
and
i
wonder
why
that
sba
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
needn't
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
the
person
making
future
advances
might
think
that
it
was
perfectly
good
against
republic,
which
it
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
but
not
against
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
anything
in
the
sba
act
it
says
when
this
precisely
when
and
what
a
federal
lien
arises?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
makes
you
think
that
it
is
by
virtue
of
the
federal
law
that
a
lien
arises,
i
mean
by
some
specific
provision
of
the
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
gives
that
a
rank
in
the
priority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
isn't
anything
in
the
federal
law
that
just
says
that
is
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
nothing
in
the
sba
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
also
an
answer
to
your
argument
about
uniformity,
they
don't
seem
to
be
put
so
much
store
in
the
uniformity
if
they
instruct
all
their
local
people
to
be
awfully
careful
about
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
barnett,
i
take
it
you
think
that
the
sba
by
regulation
could
subordinate
its
lien
to
purchase
money
mortgages
and
has?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
that
you
think
that
by
regulation
it
need
not
--
it
could
have
come
out
with
other
result
on
purchase
money
mortgages.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
similarly
here
it
could
have
if
it
wanted
to
provide
by
regulation
that
their
liens
would
not
be
subordinate
to
mechanics
liens
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
it
has
been
silent
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
think
by
regulation
the
sba
could
protect
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
situation
--
from
developing
mechanics
liens.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
will
say
it,
it
has
an
lien;
it
has
a
lien
on
a
piece
of
property
that
the
borrower
sends
to
a
mechanic
and
he
does
some
work
on
it
and
he
says
pay
the
bill
and
the
owner
says
i
cant
pay,
so
he
just
holds
this.
now
could
the
sba
provide
that
its
existing
lien
nevertheless
is
prior
to
the
mechanics
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
congress
could
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think
that
you
don't
think
under
the
statute
the
sba
will
have
the
authority
to
provide
so
provide
by
regulations.
where
did
they
get
the
authority
to
subordinate
its
interest
to
purchase
money
mortgages?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
that
a
rule
that
this
court
would
enact?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
that
happened
to
be
varied
by
an
agency
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
sba
regulation
on
purchase
money
mortgages
vary
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
barnett,
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
while
ago
i
just
want
to
check
that,
you
say
13
states
would
permit
the
lien
or
the
credited
lien
or
to
replevin
the
property
from
the
mechanics
lien
holder.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
paying
his
bill?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
really
being
challenged
here
is
the
first
in
time
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
much
the
court
below
say
the
mechanics
lienor
had
a
first
lien
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
you
are
appealing,
that's
all
you
are
appealing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
fifth
circuit
that's
all
that
you
are
subordinated
to
and
any
other
transactions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
and
i
will
guarantee
you
never
run
up
$2,000
that
certainly
wasn't
on
the
first
score
around,
he
isn't
going
to
use
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
barnett,
how
do
you
suggest
relieve
the
matter
to
congress,
either
way
we
decided
we
will
obviously
leave
it
to
congress,
you
just
want
us
to
decide
it
your
way
and
then
leave
it
to
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
rule
under
the
model
uniform
commercial
code?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
fha
act
or
statute
say
that
whenever
money
is
advanced
the
government
shall
have
a
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
know
the
tax
law
say
that
at
a
certain
time
in
the
process
of
collecting
taxes,
a
lien
shall
arise
and
specifically
gives
the
government
creates
the
lien.
is
there
anything
similar
to
that
in
the
fha,
nor
in
any
other
regulation,
do
the
regulations
say
that
what
kind
of
paper
the
fha
takes
to
evidence
its
lien
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
all
this
is
right
in
the
regulations
i
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
if
you
found
in
these
set
of
regulations
they
provision
that,
that
is
strictly
in
conflict
with
a
the
uniform
commercial
code,
the
model
act
and
b
the
way
its
enacted
in
a
particular
state.
would
you
think
that
the
regulation
would
govern?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
talking
about
your
position,
if
say
the
regulation
was
flatly
contrary
to
a
provision
in
the
uniform
commercial
code
as
adopted
in
the
relevant
state,
would
the
regulation
govern
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
for
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
apparently
concede
that
it
would
be
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
is
a
federal
law
then,
if
it
is
a
federal
question
and
then
agency
regulation
was
issued
covering
the
disputed
issue
precisely
wouldn't
it
take
precedence
over
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
working
conflict
with
the
statute
as
well,
with
the
federal
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
isn't
the
question
whether
there
is
any
statute
giving
it
any
such
authority.
you
are
not
assuming
there
is
some
statutory
basis
for
the
fha
to
draft
one
set
of
priority
rules
and
the
sba
to
draft
another
set
and
then
each
government
agency
to
draft
rules
or
the
things
will
help
in
these
priority
lien
situations
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
true,
but
it
is
a
matter
of
the
rule
to
be
adopted.
it
really
makes
a
difference
whether
you
say
you
adopt
the
uniform
commercial
code
without
the
reference
to
state
law
or
whether
you
will
just
adopt
the
uniform
commercial
code?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
i
know
you.
but
then,
it
didn't
follow
that.
it
didn't
go
to
the
--
it
did
not
follow
georgian
law
in
that
--
