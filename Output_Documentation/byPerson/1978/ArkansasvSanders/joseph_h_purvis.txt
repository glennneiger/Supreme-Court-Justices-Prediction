mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
approximately
10
minutes
of
my
time,
if
i
might,
at
the
end
for
rebuttal.
the
issue
here
before
this
court
is
whether
this
court
is
going
to
extend
its
holding
in
united
states
versus
chadwick
so
as
to
prevent
law
officers
who
are
in
the
process
of
conducting
a
valid
automobile
exception
search
from
searching
luggage
which
is
found
within
the
vehicle.
now,
it
appears
to
me
that,
from
the
facts
here,
there
are
--
there
is
no
question
but
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
automobile
search.
digressing
a
little
bit,
this
court
has
held
in
carol,
in
chadwick,
and
in
other
cases
that
it
will
recognize
an
exemption
to
the
fourth
amendment
warrant
clause
where
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
a
vehicle
contains
contraband
and
it
is
coupled
or
the
situation
is
coupled
with
exigent
circumstances.
now
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
mr.
justice,
i
think
we're
clearly
talking
apples
and
oranges
and
i
think,
in
chadwick,
this
court
made
it
extremely
plain,
mentioning
several
times,
that
it
did
not
deal
with
nor
was
it
confronted
with
an
automobile
exception
search.
the
automobile
exception
in
chadwick
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeal,
nor
was
it
brought
before
this
court.
what
you
had
there
was
a
situation
where
the
officers
had
made
the
arrest
and
had
seized
a
200-pound
double-lock
footlocker
which
was
about
to
be
placed
into
the
trunk
of
a
parked
car
with
its
engine
not
running
with
the
trunk
open.
but,
the
search
did
not
take
place
there.
it
was
after
the
officers
reduced
both
the
defendant
and
the
footlocker
to
their
exclusive
control
and
took
both
to
the
federal
building
in
boston
where
they
kept
them
for
an
hour-and-a
half
before
doing
the
search
that
led
this
court,
i
believe,
to
say,
in
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
“can
we
see
exigent
circumstances?”
here,
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
faced
with
a
search
--
we
are
faced,
first
of
all,
with
a
defendant
and
a
confederate
whose
existence
the
officers
did
not
know
until
they
saw
him
meet
up
at
the
baggage
area
of
the
airport.
these
individuals
leave
the
baggage
area
of
the
little
rock
airport,
which
incidentally
is
immediately
adjacent
to
the
door
where
the
cabs
are.
they
im
--
leave
the
baggage
area.
they
climb
into
a
taxicab
which
is
moving
down
one
of
the
busiest
there
affairs
in
town,
away
from
the
airport
at
5:00
in
rush
hour
traffic
on
friday
afternoon
after
the
courts
have
closed
for
the
weekend
to
some
point
unknown.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
it
possibly
would've,
but
i
think,
certainly,
when
you
are
speaking
of
a
200-pound
double
lock
footlocker
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
what
you
had,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
s
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
don't
think
that
the
of
--
there
was
any
way,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
the
officers
here
really
could
have
made
the
search
and
seizure
at
that
time
because
of
the
particular
facts
of
this
situation.
number
one,
they
knew
about
mr.
sanders.
it
was
almost
a
draper-like
fact
situation
corroboration
of
an
informant's
tip.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
alright,
there
was
no
corroboration
--
no
full
corroboration
until
he
picked
up
the
suitcase.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
but,
mr.
sanders
then
meets
up
with
a
confederate.
the
officers
did
not
have
any
information
on
him.
suddenly,
the
rise,
i
think
the
natural
inference
is,
well,
we
may
be
dealing
with
a
ring
here,
a
conspiracy,
certainly
more
than
warrant.
alright,
mr.
sanders,
very
coolly
then,
goes
out
and
gets
into
the
taxicab
while
mr.
rambo,
the
co-defendant,
stands
there
as
the
lookout
for
any
officers
that
might
move
in,
then
picks
the
suitcase
up
and
away
they
go.
now,
also
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
you're
also
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
officer
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
were
physically
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think,
also,
the
officers
were
far
enough
away
physically
that
they
cou
--
they
probably
could
not
have
gotten
to
it.
mr.
sanders
would've
driven
away
in
the
taxicab
had
the
officers
moved
in,
and
there's
also
the
possibility
that
the
officers
could
not
have
gotten
to
mr.
rambo
before
he
got
into
the
taxicab.
there
is
also
the
possibility
that
he
might
have
had
a
weapon.
and,
in
an
airport,
gunplay
could've
ensued.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
it
is
a
taxicab
as
opposed
to
an
individual's
private
vehicle,
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
automobile
requirement
that
says
we
will
grant
an
automobile
exception
as
to
taxicabs
but
we
--
or
as
to
private
vehicles,
but
we
won't
as
to
taxicabs.
i
think
the
same
factors,
the
same
two
basic
criteria
that
allow
the
warrantless
automobile
search
are
applicable
in
this
situation
here.
i
think
they
are
present.
i
think
there
is
certainly
the
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
taxicab
contains
contraband,
and
i
think,
given
that,
given
the
situation,
you
have
the
fact
that
there
are
certainly
exigent
circumstances.
now,
the
officers,
i
believe,
testified
in
the
hearing,
in
the
pretrial
suppression
hearing,
the
little
rock
airport
is
rather
uniquely
situated,
in
that,
there's
an
observation
deck
up
here.
there
is
a
baggage
area
here
and
here's
the
door.
out
of
which
--
the
cab
the
officers
apparently
were
up
here
on
the
observation
deck
watching
all
of
this.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
you
have
had
exactly
the
same
thing
and,
arguably,
a
lesser
intrusion
into
the
privacy
of
the
owner
of
the
goods
and
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
and
what
not
than
you
would
in
the
carroll
case
because
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
you
are
searching
the
suitcase
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
but,
it
is
an
intrical
part.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
there
is
no
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
does
the
respondent?
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
apparently
he
does
not,
no.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
because
if
you
want
to
take
the
crux
of
the
argument
further,
and
essentially
what
the
issue
is
here,
we
do
not
think
that
chadwick
applies
to
restrict
officers
who
are
making
a
legitimate
automobile
exception
search.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
certainly,
that
they
have
a
right
to
that.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
would
question
as
to
the
distinction
of
the
right
of
privacy
between
an
individual
as
to
the
contents
of
his
actual
seats
of
the
car
raised
in
peril.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think,
possibly,
you
could.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think,
possibly,
you
could.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir,
because
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
as
long
as
you
are
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir.
i
think
as
l
--
i
think
you're
talking
apples
and
oranges.
i
think
chadwick
has
its
own
relm.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir,
it
was.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
it
certainly
is
a
criteria
to
be
considered
along
with
the
totality
of
the
facts.
now,
it's
also
got
to
be
remembered
here,
the
officers
did
not
--
they
were
not
separate
herky-jerky
instances.
the
officers
did
not
stop
the
individuals,
and
then
they
did
not
place
them
under
arrest,
and
then
they
did
not
seize
the
suitcase
and
take
it
out
and
do
a
search.
the
officers
stopped
the
cab
with
the
aid
of
another
car
finally
in
rush
hour
traffic,
got
the
individuals
out,
and
immediately
asked
the
cabdriver
if
he
would
open
the
trunk
of
the
car.
the
suit
case
was
still
in
the
trunk
of
the
car.
the
trunk
--
the
suitcase
was
immediately
popped
open.
it
sa
--
they
saw
that
it
contained
marijuana.
they
closed
it
up
and
put
the
individuals
under
arrest
and
confiscated
the
suitcase,
and
down
to
the
station
they
went.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
i
said
they
--
“popped”
is
a
really
colloquial
term.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i'm
sorry
i
used
that.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
but,
they
opened
the
suitcase.
but,
apart
from
there,
mr.
justice
marshall,
defined
exigent
circumstances
in
his
dissent
in
united
states
versus
watson
saying
that
where
law
enforcement
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
offense
is
taking
place
in
their
presence
and
that
the
suspect
is,
at
that
moment,
in
possession
of
the
evidence,
then
exigent
circumstances
exists.
now,
there's
no
question
but
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
suitcase
and
that
the
defendant
here
was
in
possession,
was
committing
an
offense,
and
did
have
the
evidence
within
his
possession.
and,
i
don't
think
chadwick,
and
indeed
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
says,
as
respondent
would
have
this
court
believe,
that
upon
stopping
this
vehicle
as
they
were
authorized
to
do
that
exigent
circumstances
somehow
flitter
away
like
butterflies
or
moths
in
the
morning
light.
i
just
do
not
think
that
that
happens.
in
fact,
by
looking
at
the
facts
in
carroll
where
the
search
was
conducted
after
they
had
stopped
mr.
carroll's
automobile
some-15
miles
away
from
grand
rapids,
in
the
chambers
case
where
the
search
was
done
at
the
police
station
after
they
had
brought
the
vehicle
back,
this
leads
to
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
and,
i
think
there
was
probable
cause
to
rest
on
the
suspicion
and
i
think,
when
the
officers
observed
the
contents
of
that
suitcase,
which
i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
was
a
very
minimal
or
probably
a
far
minimal
privacy
intrusion
than
it
would
have
been
to
have
arrested
the
cab
driver
and
the
two
occupants
thereof
and
have
driven
all
of
them
down
to
the
police
station
and
waited
at
least
two
hours
while
some
magistrate
was
hunted
up
and
a
warrant
was
obtained.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
suitcase
was
in
the
trunk
of
the
cab.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
and,
we
try
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
must
confess
that
i'm
not
really
familiar
with
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
as
i
reiterated
before,
and
let
me
preference
this,
mr.
justice
stevens,
with
the
remark
that
i
think
it
seems
to
me
quite
obvious,
that
the
arkansas
supreme
court
was
so
bound
and
determined
to
fit
the
facts
of
this
case
within
the
ambit
of
chadwick
that
it
did
everything
it
could,
including
inventing
and
misconstruing
argument
on
behalf
of
the
state
try
to
shoehorn
the
facts
within
that
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think,
sir,
that
the
exigent
circumstances
were
that
you
have
a
defendant
and
a
just
met
confederate
who
are
in
a
moving
vehicle
who
are
moving
away
from
the
airport
in
rush
hour
traffic,
5:00
on
a
friday
afternoon,
after
the
courts
have
closed
to
a
point
unknown
on
one
of
the
busiest
streets
in
town.
and,
i
think
those
were
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
both
because
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
under
the
facts
here
where
you
have,
as
we
contend,
a
legitimate
automobile
search,
that
given
the
language
of
chambers
v.
maroney,
there
is
no
constitutional
difference
between
a
search
--
warrantless
search
at
the
scene
and
taking
the
individuals
all
back
to
the
police
station.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
there
couldn't
have
been
a
warrant
obtained
at
which
juncture,
after
the
search,
before
the
search?
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
there
could
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
a
warrant
could've
been
obtained
before
these
officers
went
to
the
airport
because
all
they
had
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
were
facts.
alright,
certainly,
after
the
fact,
these
officer
were
engaged
in
a
rather
high-speed
chase
through
the
traffic.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
well,
sir,
i
don't
believe
the
motor
had
cooled
off
by
the
time
they
had
done
the
search.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
they
could
have,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
do
not
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
it
goes
back
to
the
fact
that,
given
a
valid
auto
search,
the
exigent
circumstances
do
not
immediately
vanish
when
you
have
stopped
the
individual.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
our
point
is
that,
given
an
automobile
exception,
that
it
naturally
extends
to
the
contents
of
the
vehicle.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
if
it
were
--
i
think,
if
it
were
within
an
automobile
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
and
you
were
there
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
exception
search.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think,
to
a
certain
extent,
mr.
justice
white,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
made
by
officers
who
are
there
at
the
scene
based
upon
their
practical
experience
or
not.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir,
but
i
think
that
the
cases
seem
to
make
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think,
under
the
facts,
i
cannot
recite
more
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
forgive
me
for
not
going
into
that,
but
this
court
has
noted
time
and
time
again
that,
given
a
moving
automobile,
that
the
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it
contains
contraband
is
the
real
touchstone
with
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
to
hold
anything
otherwise
would
create,
as
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
finnegan,
would
create
wholly
a
logical
results
or
it
would,
as
we
contend,
totally
emasculate
the
automobile
exception
because
you
get
into
a
situation.
if
you
are
going
to
create
an
exception
for
luggage,
what
constitutes
luggage?
i
have
ridden
on
many
buses
in
my
lifetime
with
people
who
were
too
poor
to
buy
formal
american
tours
to
emilia
earhart
who
carried
their
whole
possessions
in
a
sack.
and,
what
practically
occurs
then
at
that
point
is
you
have
officers
who
do
not
know
who
automatically
then
think
i
cannot
do,
given
a
valid
auto
search
stop
or
stop
in
auto
search,
you
have
officers
who
are
afraid
who
will
not
do
a
search
of
the
vehicle
of
any
sack,
bag,
what
not.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir,
i
think
you
can
because
i
think,
to
do
otherwise,
you
tend
to
focus
the
fourth
amendment
away
from
the
right
of
privacy
and
toward
places
and
things.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think,
for
anyone
to
expect
that
a
piano
would
be
stuffed
in
a
glove
compartment
would
be
rather
ludicrous.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
you
probably
could.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
when
you're
talking
glove
compartment,
you
arguably
bring
in
some
new
exceptions
to
the
fourth
amendment.
you
arguably
bring
in
chimel.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
indeed,
and
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
exactly.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
but,
here
again,
we're
talking
apples
and
oranges.
we're
talking
search
incident
as
opposed
to
if
there
is
exigent
circumstance.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir.
i
tried
to
make
the
distinction
over
here
that
you
were
dealing
with
a
different
parent.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir?
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think,
possibly,
you
would.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
you
could
really
proceed
really
under
either
theory.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
certainly
think
you
can
and
i
think
that
that
situation,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
extremely
analogous
to
the
situation
in
chambers
where
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
vehicle
contained
four
men
who
fit
the
description
of
the
robbers
of
a
store,
and
that
was
the
reason
that
they
stopped.
and,
once
given
that
valid
auto
exception
search,
i
think
or
--
it
allowed
them
or
deemed
reasonable
the
search
of
the
entire
vehicle.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
it
could
also
be
authorized
and
probably
would
better
be
authorized
in
that
situation
as
a
search
incident
to
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
that's
carrying
it
to
an
extreme,
but
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
the
search
of
the
glove
box
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
would
be
far
more
akin
to
that.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
it
seems
to
me,
to
--
something
to
be
remembered
here
is
that
this
court
has
also
repeatedly
held
that
those
who
occupy
an
automobile
moving
on
the
highway
operate
under
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy,
and
to
hold
that
it
is
the
automobile
itself
which
enjoys
that
diminished
expectation
of
privacy,
i
think
is
frivolous.
certainly,
there's
no
such
thing
as
an
inanimate
object
that
occupies
or
that
--
in
yours
or
has
that
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
alright,
i
will
save
the
rest
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
just
a
very
few
remarks,
your
honor.
first,
contrary
to
mr.
lassiter,
i
think,
again,
let
me
reiterate,
what
we
have
here
is
not
necessary
an
arrest
prior
to
seizure
and
all
of
this,
but
we
have
one
rather
rapid
smooth-flowing
set
of
circumstances.
and,
it
seems
clear,
to
me
at
least,
that
the
search
of
the
suitcase
was
clearly
justifiable
under
the
automobile
exception.
in
fact,
it
was
part
--
in
partial
and
didn't
constitute
the
search
of
the
automobile
itself
to
hold
that
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
present.
merely
when
the
officer
stopped
them
would
be,
number
one,
it
seems
to
me,
to
deny
the
smooth-flowing
facts
of
the
case
and
of
the
search
which
was
highly
contemporaneous
to
the
stopping
and,
two,
to
say
that
they
had
evaporated
in
that
sort
of
situation
makes
it
rather
impossible
to
have
exigent
circumstances
present
in
any
situation
where
you've
stopped
any
automobile.
we
use
the
rather
farfetched
analogy
in
our
brief
that,
in
order
to
follow
this
particular
logic,
you
would
have
to
have
someone
make
a
john
wayne
style
leap
from
one
moving
vehicle
into
another,
and
to
conduct
the
search
while
the
vehicle
was
still
moving
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court,
nor
any
court,
nor
any
human
being
with
a
whit
of
common
sense
would
say
that
that
would
be
required.
it
goes
simply
to
the
point
that
exigent
circumstances,
once
present,
don't
--
do
not
quickly
evaporate
merely
because
the
police
have
stopped
the
individual.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
frankly
don't
know,
your
honor,
because
i
am
not
aware
of
an
extension
of
the
automobile
exception
to
any
such
large
common
carrier.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir,
to
a
certain
extent
that
i
do.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
that,
of
all
the
common
carriers
of
which
i
know,
that
the
taxicab
probably
is
intended
to
be
a
repository
of
the
fewer
number
of
people.
you
generally
have
anywhere
from
one
to
four
people
who
obtain
a
taxicab
as
opposed
to
an
airplane
or
a
bus
where
you
may
have
50,
60,
or
hundreds.
and,
it
seems
also
to
me
that
if
you
say,
as
mr.
lassiter
does,
well,
you
can
conduct
a
valid
search
of
this
automobile
but
you
can't
--
or
seizure
of
the
suitcase
but
you
can't
do
a
search
because
of
the
privacy
right,
then
you're
saying
that,
given
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
vehicle,
that
you
are
going
to
place
then
your
truck
entirely
on
the
place
or
the
thing
in
which
that
alleged
privacy
right
was
focused,
namely
a
suitcase
or
a
piece
of
luggage.
and,
i
think
it's
the
right
of
privacy
overall
and
i
think,
given
one
who
is
an
automobile,
it
is
expectation
of
privacy
over
the
contents
of
the
automobile.
his
possession
is
in
the
automobile
that
are
reduced.
also,
going
back
too,
i
think
you
get
--
you
are
confronted
again,
if
you
follow
mr.
lassiter's
logic,
with
the
definition
of
“what
is
luggage?”
and
i
would
agree
with
jack
that
one
of
the
primary
focuses
is
to
come
to
some
sort
of
predictability
because
all
law
enforcement
people
would
like
this
and
people
on
both
sides
of
the
fence.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
say
that
we
are
going
to
create
an
exemption
of
the
automobile
exception
or
carve
out
an
exception
within
him
for
luggage
or
repositories
of
private
effects
that
you
are
engaging
in
a
never
ending
battle,
a
never
ending
definition
because
what
may
be
trash
to
me
might
be
someone
else's
luggage
and
you
can
battle
this
out
forever.
finally,
i
think,
too,
the
one
key
thing
to
remember
is
the
question
that
needs
to
be
answered
here
was,
“was
this
search
of
the
suitcase
reasonable
under
the
circumstances?”
and,
given
the
exigent
circumstances
which
i
had
previously
stated,
which
i've
earnestly
feel
existed
that
justified
the
stopping,
i
think
--
with
the
expectation
of
privacy,
i
think
it
was
only
reasonable
for
those
officers
to
open
up
that
suitcase
and
look
inside
it.
had
they
found
nothing,
obviously,
mr.
sanders
and
his
defendant
would
have
been
allowed
to
go
on
their
way
and
i
think
it
is
exactly
this
situation
that
this
court
referred
to
in
its
opinion
in
chambers
that,
given
the
valid
auto
exception,
there
is
no
constitutional
difference.
in
fact,
it
may
very
well
be,
the
court
held
implicitly,
a
lesser
intrusion
of
the
right
of
privacy
to
allow
that
immediate
warrantless
search
on
the
scene
as
opposed
to
taking
the
individuals
back
and
waiting
several
hours
upon
the
obtaining
of
a
warrant.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
certainly,
which
leads
to
another
problem.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
which,
leads
to
another
problem
too,
and
that
is
consent.
it
is
very
easy
to
say
“well,
he
could
have
consented
to
it.”
however,
i'm
sure
mr.
lassiter,
as
a
trial
lawyer,
very
well
knows
the
problem
of
consent
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
proving
consent
at
the
time
of
trial
or
at
the
appellate
level
are
two
different
things.
very
often,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
has
rejected
twice
in
the
past
three
weeks
consent
searches
where
there
was
testimony
of
two
officers
and,
indeed,
a
consent
form
signed
where
the
lower
court
found
that
there
was
valid
consent,
and
the
arkansas
court
held,
well,
because
it
was
a
situation
where
there
were
three
officers
in
uniform
with
guns
and
one
defendant
or
two
defendants,
there
was
the
natural
coercion
there
and
we
just
cannot
believe
that
this
was
a
valid
consent.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir,
they
were.
they
--
it
was
by
a
four-member
panel,
and
all
four
members
were
unanimous.
we
have
filed
petitions
for
rehearing.
