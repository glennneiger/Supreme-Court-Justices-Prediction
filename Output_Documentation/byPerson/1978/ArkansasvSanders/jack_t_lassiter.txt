mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
jack
lassiter,
the
court-appointed
attorney
for
the
respondent,
mr.
sanders.
what
do
we
do
with
the
suitcase
in
the
trunk
of
the
cab?
before
i
start
in
here,
let
me
say
it
is
simply
the
respondent's
position
that
we
have
no
exigent
circumstances
here
once
the
cab
is
stopped,
once
mr.
sanders
is
arrested,
along
with
his
cohort,
mr.
rambo,
and
the
suitcase
is
seized.
i
can't
think
of
what
possible
exigency
then
exist.
whether
mr.
sanders
was
placed
in
the
rear
of
the
police
car
or
he
was
handcuffed
outside
the
police
car
prior
to
the
entry
into
the
truck
--
trunk
of
the
cab
i
think,
in
either
situation,
any
exigency
seized
at
that
point.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
when
the
cab
is
stopped
and
mr.
sanders
is
placed
under
arrest,
and
then
the
trunk
is
opened
and
the
suitcase
itself
is
seized,
removed
from
the
trunk
of
the
cab.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
i
have
not
argued
that
they
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
open
the
trunk
and
seize
the
suitcase
itself,
just
that
that
they
could
not
then
enter
the
suitcase
without
prior
judicial
authorization.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
think
you
could
certainly
argue
that
and
maybe
i'm
arguing
against
my
position
a
little
bit,
but
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
based
--
is
based
on
the
expectation
of
privacy.
what
we
want
to
protect
is
the
content
of
the
suitcase.
if
we
follow
the
reasoning
in
carroll
and
the
other
car
search
exceptions,
we
allow
the
officers
to
get
into
the
automobile
due
to
the
mobility
factor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
the
lower
courts
have
in
the
past.
now,
the
alternative
here
would
have
been
to
take
the
cab
on
into
the
station
house,
i
guess,
and
get
a
warrant
before
they
opened
the
trunk.
and,
you
can
certainly
argue
that
once
the
piece
of
luggage
is
placed
in
the
trunk
and
the
trunk
is
closed
that
the
expectation
of
privacy,
i
guess,
then
attaches
to
the
contents
of
the
trunk.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that
is
what
i
was
about
to
get
to
here
and
now.
mr.
sanders
was
not
the
owner
of
the
cab.
he
didn't
have
control
of
the
trunk
and
it
was
the
driver
himself
who
could,
i
presume,
consent
to
opening
the
trunk
for
the
officers
but
not
consent
to
the
officers
entering
the
suitcase.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
think
so.
i
think
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
seize
the
suitcase.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
it's
certainly
not
in
the
chimel
wings
braid
is
into
the
truck.
mr.
sanders
has
already
been
arrested.
he's
not
going
to
reach
back
there
and
pull
it
out.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
the
transcript
is
quite
clear
on
that.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
certainly.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
certainly.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
what
they
very
simply
could
do
with
it,
what
the
lrpd
would
do
with
it
is
take
it
back
to
the
station
house
and
put
it
in
the
property
range
so
it
would
not
go
anywhere
then
and
nobody
is
going
to
get
back
there
to
get
the
weapon.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
citizenry
is
protected
at
that
point
when
somebody
taking
the
weapon
had
the
suitcase
and
doing
something
with
it.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
only
if
chimel
were
to
apply
to
the
fact
situation.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
alright,
what
if
they
arrest
him
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
and
they
handcuff
him
and
the
suitcase
is
then
standing
by
his
side
where
he
can't
possibly
get
into
it,
i
think
maybe
that's
a
case-by-case
determination,
your
honor.
certainly,
in
some
instances,
chimel
would
justify
the
entry.
in
some,
it
would
not.
in
chadwick,
the
individual
was
sitting
on
top
of
the
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
individual
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
and
chimel
justifies
the
entry,
they
could
go
ahead
into
the
suitcase
to
look
for
weapon
to
protect
themselves.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that
would
be
correct,
as
long
as
the
suitcase
is
within
his
wingspread.
once,
i
guess,
the
suspect
himself
is
immobilized
by
being
handcuffed
or
placed
in
the
back
of
the
police
unit,
at
that
point
he
can't
reach
into
that
briefcase
in
search
for
weapon
and
there
is
no
reason
for
the
police
to
enter
it.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
they
could've
taken
mr.
sanders
back
at
that
time,
along
with
the
suitcase,
and
they
could've
held
him
while
they
procured
a
warrant.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
hesitated
answering
that
because
i
had
some
questions
after
reading
the
transcript
as
to
where
the
informant
had
received
his
information,
whether
it
really
reached
the
requirements
of
spinelli
and
aguilar,
but
that
has
been
conceded
far
below,
i
guess,
that
probable
cause
was
present.
so,
let's
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
what
i'm
saying
is
i'm
not
raising
that
here
and,
for
purposes
of
our
argument,
we
can't
concede
that
they
did
have
probable
cause
to
seize
the
suitcase
and
that
a
warrant
would
have
been
issued.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it
certainly
would.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it
certainly
would
have,
and
he
could
also
have
sit
on
the
spot,
“i
don't
want
to
go
down
to
the
station
house.
go
ahead
and
search
it
here
and
i'll
be
on
my
way.”
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
not.
however,
the
next
question
that
flows
from
that
is,
is
there
an
expectation
of
privacy
to
nine
pounds
of
marijuana
in
the
suitcase?
all
i
can
say
is
the
focus
of
the
analysis
in
the
court
--
by
the
court
in
the
past
has
been
on
the
expectation
of
privacy
that
attaches
to
the
area
itself,
here,
the
suitcase.
if
there
is
no
expectation
--
if
the
analysis
centered
on
whether
or
not
there
is
ex
--
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
contraband,
we
would
not
have
had
the
chadwick
decision
because
that's
precisely
what
we
had
there,
a
footlocker
full
of
marijuana.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
it
is.
i
think
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
if
the
car
is
stolen
and
the
driver
is
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
if
they're
looking
for
the
piano,
then
you
can't
look
for
an
elephant
in
a
matchbox,
i
think
somebody
told
me
in
law
school
one
time.
you
sure
wouldn't
have
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
a
piano
in
that
glove
box.
again,
chimel
may
come
into
play.
if
the
glove
box
itself
is
within
the
reach
of
the
individual
who's
been
arrested
and
it
is
unlocked,
perhaps
the
officers
can
enter
therein.
we
certainly,
through
the
gustafson
and
robinson
opinion,
indicate
that
the
officers
on
even
traffic
stop
can
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
and
that
would
again
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
and
i
would
agree
with
that.
and,
that,
again
would
be
your
holding
in
chimel.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
that'd
depend
on
what
have
been
done
with
the
driver.
if
he's
been
taken
and
placed
in
the
back
of
the
police
unit
with
locked
doors,
there's
not
going
to
be
much
danger
that
he's
going
to
be
back
in
the
front
of
the
truck,
car,
cab,
or
whatever
to
get
the
weapon.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
--
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
wants
to
tell
law
enforcement
officers
that
any
time
they
stop
an
individual
when
there's
probable
cause
of
arrest
and
then
not
probable
cause
for
search
of
the
automobile,
that
the
officers
can
go
in
and
completely
search
the
interior
of
the
automobile,
once
the
driver
has
been
removed
from
access
to
the
automobile
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
and,
we
justify
that
because
the
police
need
to
protect
themselves
by
searching
the
person,
and
we
did
that
same
thing
in
robinson.
you
can
search
the
driver
on
a
traffic
stop.
but,
it
seems
to
me
that,
and
our
cases
in
the
past
have
said
that,
whenever
we
conduct
a
warrantless
search,
those
situations
must
be
carefully
defined
and
they
must
be
justified
by
exigencies
or
the
reason
for
the
search
must
be
imperative
or
compelling.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
once
the
driver
is
removed
from
the
vicinity
of
the
automobile,
there's
no
compelling
reason
then
to
enter
the
automobile
looking
for
weapon
in
your
hypothetical.
if
i
might
return
to
a
question
you
raised
a
moment
ago,
is
there
a
distinction
between
a
cab
and
a
private
vehicle,
there
certainly
might
well
be.
i
think
a
passenger
in
a
cab
certainly
has
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
than
i
do
in
my
car
out
on
the
street
to
what's
contained
in
my
glove
compartment
or
under
my
seat.
but,
he
still
has
an
obvious
expectation
of
privacy
to
the
contents
of
his
suitcase.
there
was
a
question
raised
a
moment
ago
as
to
whether
it
made
any
difference
whether
or
not
the
suitcase
was
locked.
that
is
a
factor
raised
by
the
state
in
an
attempt
to
distinguish
chadwick
from
the
instant
case.
arguably,
there
is
a
--
an
ex
--
a
lesser
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
rakas.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
rakas
says
that
the
passenger
in
the
automobile
does
not
have
standing
to
raise
the
motion
to
suppress
if
he
--
if
the
car
doesn't
belong
to
him
and
he
does
not
exhibit
any
sort
of
proprietary
interest
in
that
item
which
the
state
is
seeking
to
introduce
into
evidence,
the
court
rejecting
the
target
theory.
now
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct
and
that
that
would
be
--
i'm
moving
to
hopefully
distinguishing
the
standing
problem
here.
the
difference
in
what
we
had
in
rakas
and
what
we've
got
here,
i
think,
are
two-fold.
one,
the
police
alleged
that
this
marijuana
contained
in
the
suitcase
belongs
to
the
defendant.
haven't
they
given
him
standing
by
doing
that?
and
that
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
your
honor?
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
and,
secondly
here,
in
sanders,
the
contraband
in
the
cab
is
the
crux
of
the
charge.
he's
charged
with
possession
of
marijuana
with
intent
to
deliver.
in
rakas
or
rakus,
however
it's
pronounced,
the
individual
there
was
charged,
i
believe,
with
robbery
or
some
violent
crime.
and,
the
item
introduced
is
a
weapon.
he's
not
charged
with
felony
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
so,
i
think
the
case
is
distinguishable.
it
is
the
--
we
simply
haven't
have
enough
time
for
the
lower
courts
to
throw
it
around
enough
to
know
exactly
what
we're
going
to
do
with
it.
i
would
argue
that
he
does
have
standing
because
the
crux
of
the
charge
is
the
possession
of
the
contraband,
in
that,
it
was
his
suitcase
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
the
police
say
it
was
his.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
certainly.
i
think
it
was
about
to
comment
concerning
the
fact
that
the
suitcase
was
unlocked.
i
don't
really
see
that
that
invites
public
entry
into
the
suitcase
any
more
than
you're
inviting
someone
into
your
house
by
leaving
a
door
unlocked
or
a
window
unlatched.
perhaps
the
reason,
and
i
must
go
to
this
any
one,
that
a
number
of
us
travel
with
our
suitcases
unlocked.
it's
just
for
the
reason
that
we
don't
expect
people
to
get
into
them,
other
than
perhaps
at
a
border
entry
point
or
at
a
checkpoint
prior
to
getting
into
an
airplane.
i
really
don't
see
that
as
a
persuasive
distinguishing
factor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that
would
be
correct.
there
is
a
distinction
that
the
attorney
general
raises
or
portends
to
raise
based
on
chambers,
in
which
he
addresses
language
therein
that
speaks
of
the
lesser
and
greater
intrusion
analysis
in
chambers.
the
argument
there
was
that
once
the
car
is
seized,
the
subsequent
entry
into
the
automobile
later
on
is
just
simply
a
lesser
intrusion
from
the
greater
intrusion
into
the
constitutional
protection
of
seizing
the
automobile.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
analysis
was
abandoned
in
chadwick
in
a
footnote
to
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
in
which
he
points
out
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
proprietary
property
interest
in
the
object,
be
it
a
car
or
a
suitcase,
which
is
not
--
which
is
something
entirely
different
from
the
individual's
privacy
expectation
in
the
contents
thereof.
certainly,
as
was
stated
in
chadwick,
the
far
greater
intrusion
is
into
the
suitcase,
not
the
mere
seizure
of
it.
there
is
one
further
point
that
i
would
raise
to
the
court.
obviously,
we
take
the
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
mandate
that
we
should
be
protected
in
our
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
and
that
the
exceptions
to
the
general
warrant
requirement,
carefully
drawn,
should
require
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
before
intrusion
into
the
suitcase
under
circumstances
in
this
case.
i
feel
that
that's
a
better
rule
of
law.
there
is
one
further
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it
would
appear,
under
terry
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
unless
the
envelope
seemed
to
contain
a
weapon,
i
don't
think
you
could
justify
it.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
that
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
think
so,
under
robinson.
don't
--
there,
we
find
that
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
believe,
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
in
response
to
your
question,
i
believe
under
robinson,
i
believe,
there,
we
had
a
marijuana
cigarette
found
in
a
crushed
cigarette
package.
so,
the
answer
to
your
question,
i
believe,
would
be
yes,
you
could.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
right.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
the
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
there
is
no
justification
for
the
warrantless
entry
into
it.
we
have
justification
for
the
warrantless
entry
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
think,
under
robinson,
you
would.
it
is
a
difficult
stance
we
make.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
think
the
offerman
case
is
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
i
don't
agree
that
it's
alright.
the
opperman
case,
i
think,
has
been
used
in
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no.
certainly,
he
could
be
patted
down
and
his
person
searched.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
alright,
the
--
that's
correct.
the
individual
can
be
searched.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
and
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
robinson
and
terry
in
the
cases
that
talk
about
the
search
incident
to
arrest
of
the
individual.
i
would
not
carry
the
inventory
--
well,
if
he
raised
the
question
concerning
inventory
as
to
the
person
of
the
defendant
arrest,
certainly
he
can
searched.
i
don't
think
the
inventory
case,
opperman,
justifies
entry
into
the
suitcase
or
briefcase.
i
think
the
police
can
take
the
suitcase
or
briefcase.
they
could
put
a
piece
of
tape
on
it,
seal
it,
and
put
it
on
the
property
rim
and
all
the
rationale,
the
supporting
rationale,
of
the
inventory
search
is
deemed
satisfied.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor.
i
understand
that,
and
that
certainly
raises
a
can
of
worms,
but
i
think
the
test
must
be
that
the
object,
the
repository
personal
effects
must
be
clearly
without
doubt,
without
argument.
obviously,
a
repository
personal
effects,
a
shoebox
that
have
been
taped
shut,
a
box
that's
not
taped
shut,
a
sack
that's
just
rolled
down,
i
don't
think
meets
that
test.
i
don't
know
what
we'd
do
if
the
box
is
taped
shut,
the
shoebox
is
taped
shut.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no,
i
think
one
warrant
would
be
sufficient
to
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
i
think
so.
once
we
say
that
the
expectation
of
privacy,
the
sphere
that
it
--
the
protected
sphere
could
be
penetrated,
i
think,
properly
with
one
warrant.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
necessity
of
a
series
of
warrants.
particularly
not
in
this
situation,
nine
pounds
of
marijuana
could
have
been,
i
guess,
conceivably
in
one
container
inside
another
container
inside
the
suitcase,
but
i
think
once
they're
in,
they're
properly
in.
there
is
one
other
matter
that
i
believe
to
be
worthy
of
mention.
we
talk
a
lot
in
law
enforcement
and
in
defense
work
about
predictability
in
these
cases.
everybody
wants
it,
the
police,
the
attorney
general,
the
folks
on
my
side
of
the
dance.
isn't
it
most
predictable
and
most
consistent
to
say
that
whether
this
suitcase
is
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
or
it's
on
the
sidewalk,
the
police
ought
to
get
a
warrant
to
enter
it?
in
chadwick,
we've
said
that,
as
far
as
this
repository
personal
effects
is
concerned,
if
it's
outside
the
car
and
we
can't
get
it
under
chimel,
then
the
police
are
going
to
have
to
get
a
warrant.
should
we
have
a
different
rule
at
all
in
the
automobile,
wouldn't
it
be
most
consistent
to
also
require
a
warrant
to
search
it
if
it's
in
the
car,
unless
it
happens
to
fall
within
the
chimel
wingspread.
if
we
don't
do
that,
we're
going
to
have
a
rather
inconsistent
situation
and
you're
going
to
encourage
police
to
wait
until
the
suitcase
gets
in
the
car
at
the
airport
and
tear
off
in
this
high
speed
chase
sometimes
through
traffic.
i
think
the
better
rule
would
be
to
require
the
warrant.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
alright.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
would
not.
first,
let's
assume
that
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
okay,
let's
assume
that
--
let's
assume
you
have
probable
cause
here.
this
individual
supplied
the
information
as
a
reliable
informant
we
meet
in
aguilar
and
spinelli
and
we
take
off
after
it.
i
think,
still,
the
warrant
requirement
ought
to
prevail
before
we
go
entering
into
the
suitcase.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
want
them
to
enter
the
luggage
unless
they
do
have
a
warrant.
i
just
--
certainly,
i
can
take
the
decision
test
distinguishable
from
this
case
because
they
knew
that
the
marijuana
was
inside
the
suitcase,
and
i
guess
i
can
have
my
cake
and
eat
it
too
in
the
argument.
but,
it
strikes
me
that
we
need
to
draw
a
line
somewhere,
of
course,
or
choosing
it
ought
to
be
with
our
repositories
or
personal
effects
in
the
courts
therein
and
a
police
officer
should
not
enter
into
the
suitcase,
the
footlocker,
the
briefcase,
or
whatever
that
object
which,
on
its
face,
apparently
exhibits
an
expectation
of
privacy
without
the
police
having
a
warrant.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
to
seize
and
remove.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
well,
certainly,
we
need
something.
yes,
if
you're
asking
me
different
probable
cause
from
the
arrest.
here,
i
think
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
is
sufficient
for
issuance
of
the
warrant.
i'll
concede
that.
if
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
i
would
--
i
will
concede
here
that
the
probable
cause
for
arrest
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
would
also
be
sufficient
for
issuance
of
the
warrant.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it
--
the
issue
--
the
key
to
the
issue
is
getting
it
before
the
magistrate.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
exactly,
and
--
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
no,
and
the
suitcase
should
not
be
searched
in
that
situation.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
your
honor.
sometimes,
probable
cause
for
arrest
may
be
the
same
as
far
as
probable
cause
issues.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
yes,
certainly.
it
--
in
your
hypothetical,
if
we
believe
that
a
murder
has
been
accomplished
with
the
45-automatic
by
this
individual,
he's
seen
running
from
the
scene,
he's
arrested
soon
thereafter
with
the
briefcase,
i
believe,
perhaps,
we
sh
--
we
could
get
the
warrant
for
entering
the
briefcase
to
look
for
the
automatic.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
and,
hopefully,
with
these
well-defined
rules
as
we
can
possibly
create
to
give
us
some
predictability
of
the
situation.
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
t.
lassiter
it's
a
very
difficult
problem,
your
honor.
