general
purvis
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
there
are
any
more
exigent
circumstances
here
than
would
be
--
than
would
accompany
an
ordinary
automobile
search.
do
you
think
the
automobile
exception,
as
you
call
it,
rests
on
some
assessment
of
the
generality
of
exigent
circumstances
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
carroll
and
chambers
are
saying
that
you
can
search
a
car
on
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
now,
just
as
a
general
proposition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
stop
it
and
you
don't
stop
in
every
individual
case
to
decide
whether
there
are
exigent
circumstances
in
that
particular
case,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
this
--
does
this
one
have
any
more
exigent
circumstances
than
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
exigent
circumstance?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
you
could
get
into
a
locked
house,
you
could
get
into
a
locked
suitcase
in
a
trunk?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
your
--
what
if
there's
been
a
piano
stolen
and
you
stop
a
truck
and
you
want
to
search
for
--
see
if
the
truck's
got
the
piano
in
it?
you
think
you
can
search
in
the
glove
compartment?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
no,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
say,
you've
got
probable
cause
to
stop
the
truck
to
search
for
the
piano.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
can't
--
why,
if
he's
got
probable
cause
to
search
for
a
piano?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
you
get
into
the
glove
compartment?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
what
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
could
they
get
into
the
trunk?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
there's
a
--
assume
there's
probable
--
at
least
let's
just
assume
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
contraband
or
something
in
the
suitcase.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
so,
there
was
probable
cause
to
stop
the
cab.
and,
once
the
arrest
is
made
and
the
cab
is
stopped,
why
do
i
--
why
wouldn't
you
have
to
get
a
warrant
to
get
in
the
--
to
make
the
search
of
the
car,
of
the
taxi
cab?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
why
not
get
--
have
to
get
a
warrant
to
get
into
the
trunk?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
trunk?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
arrest
a
man
on
the
street
whom
you've
got
probable
cause
to
arrest
or
you've
got
a
warrant
for
his
arrest,
and
he's
carrying
a
suitcase.
now,
can
you
search
the
suitcase
right
on
the
spot
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he's
got
it
in
his
hands.
he's
walking
along.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
right
on
the
street.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
--
does
it
make
any
difference,
in
your
answer
to
my
question,
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
think
there
was
anything
in
the
suitcase?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
answer
is,
no,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
have
probable
cause
to
think
there's
anything
in
the
suitcase.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
concede
a
moment
ago
that
they
could
seize
the
suitcase.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
require
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there's
a
weapon
and
if
there
is
a
reason
putting
a
lock,
could
anybody
ask?
justice
byron
r.
white
say,
you
arrested
a
man
on
the
street
with
probable
cause
or
with
a
warrant
and
he's
carrying
a
suitcase
and
it's
locked,
and
a
--
you
search
him
and
you
find
a
sealed
envelope
in
his
inside
pocket.
can
you
open
the
envelope?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
terry?
well,
what
about
a
search
incident
to
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can't
search
a
suitcase
and
examine
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
a
different
antici
--
expectation
of
privacy,
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
rationale?
justice
byron
r.
white
into
the
envelope?
justice
byron
r.
white
into
the
sealed
envelope?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
your
suitcase
had
a
locked
container
inside
it.
you'd
have
to
get
two
horns?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
you
say
that
you'd
have
to
have
a
separate
probable
cause
to
warrant
--
to
get
the
warrant
to
get
into
the
suitcase?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
what
would
you
have
to
show
the
magistrate?
wouldn't
you
have
to
show
him
--
if
you've
got
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
suitcase
and
you
don't
want
it
violated,
shouldn't
there
be
some
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there's
something
in
the
suitcase
the
officer
is
entitled
to
seize?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
that
might
be
quite
different
from
the
--
suppose
you
arrested
this
man
for
stealing
a
piano
and
he
had
this
suitcase
with
him
and
you
seized
him
and
his
suitcase
and
took
him
down
to
the
station
house.
now,
you
--
could
you
get
a
warrant
to
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
need
not
only
the
warrant.
you
need
a
separate
probable
cause
to
support
the
warrant
for
the
suitcase.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
the
same,
exactly.
