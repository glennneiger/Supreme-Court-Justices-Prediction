justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
purvis,
these
facts
you've
described,
so
far,
make
this
sound
like
a
much
more
--
kind
of
a
fluid
situations
and
not
really
the
classical
automobile
search
exception
when
we
knew
you've
got
a
taxi.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
wouldn't
that
--
i
can
see
how
that
might
give
them
probable
cause
to
seize
the
suitcase,
but
how
about
searching
at
an
opening
right
on
the
spot?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
had
understood
you
to
say
that
the
police,
in
effect,
had
two
or
three
balls
bouncing
in
the
air
at
one
time
and
that,
for
that
reason,
it
was
a
stronger
case
than
the
ordinary
automobile
search
case
with
the
confederate,
the
suitcase,
and
the
person
in
the
cab.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
comp
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
probable
cause
to
arrest
someone
in
the
vehicle?
do
you
think
that
would
also
provide
a
basis
for
searching
everything
in
the
vehicle
or
just
what
you
could
call
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
if
you
simply
have
probable
cause
to
stop
a
vehicle
because
you
had
reason
to
believe
that
a
suspect
was
in
the
vehicle
without
any
additional
evidence,
you
could
search
the
trunk,
get
out
a
suitcase,
and
search
the
suitcase?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
although,
perhaps
the
person
that
you
were
--
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
was
thought
to
be
fleeing
a
suspect
and
has
no
connection
with
the
suitcase?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
were
some
sort
of
a
loaded
weapon
in
the
suitcase
or
something
to
that
effect,
do
you
think
they
would
have
a
right
to
open
it
on
the
spot
rather
than
carted
it
on
for
a
couple
of
hours
until
they
could
get
it
to
a
magistrate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
couldn't
get
access
to
it
pers
--
the
police
could've
presented
--
prevented
him
from
getting
access
to
it
without
having
opening
on
the
spot.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wha
--
isn't
there
some
re
--
something
to
be
said
for
the
idea
that
the
police
shouldn't
be
obligated
to
carry
around
for
several
hours
a
trunk
which
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
has
a
weapon
in
it
without
being
able
to
open
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
his
suitcase,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
also
presumably
rented
the
suitc
--
rented
the
trunk
as
well
as
the
space
he
was
riding
in
for
the
purposes
of
that
particular
trip.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
search
anything
on
the
guy's
person.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
them
to
search
the
suitcase?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
take
it,
if
you
arrest
someone
who
--
because
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
just
assassinated
someone
or
murdered
someone,
you
might
have
--
that
same
probable
cause
would
justify
you
in
getting
a
warrant
for
searching
his
suitcase
in
a
way
that
probable
cause
to
believe
he
had
stolen
a
piano
would
not.
i
mean,
doesn't
it
depend
a
little
bit
on
the
kind
of
offense
that
you're
talking
about?
