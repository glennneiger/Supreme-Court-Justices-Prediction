is
it
your
submission
that
there
was
probable
cause
not
only
to
search
but
at
the
time
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
occupants
of
the
cab?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
was
the
suitcase
in
the
cab?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
trunk.
so,
under
chimel,
it's
doubtful
whether
this
would've
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
search
incident
to
allow
for
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
thinking
about
the
rios
case
which
involved
a
taxicab.
i
don't
know
if
you're
familiar
with
it,
364
us
involve
the
stop
of
a
taxicab.
justice
potter
stewart
the
moving
automobile
makes
for
the
exigent
circumstance.
justice
potter
stewart
a
moving
automobile
on
a
highway
or
street?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
when
you
--
when
a
passenger
gets
into
a
taxicab,
the
car
portend
does
belong
to
him.
he's
hired
it.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
limits
of
chimel.
justice
potter
stewart
after
a
lawful
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lassiter,
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
concede,
i
guess,
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
these
people,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
if
there
was
and
they
were
in
a
moving
car,
certainly,
the
arrest
would
have
to
be
accomplished
right
then
and
there
and
they
would've
had
to
be
--
the
people
would've
had
to
be
removed
from
the
car.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
also,
the
--
you
concede,
since
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
there
was
probable
cause
to
search,
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
without
a
warrant
under
carroll
doctrine
and,
therefore,
to
remove
the
suitcase
from
the
car.
justice
potter
stewart
seize
and
remove.
you
concede
all
of
that,
therefore,
to
take
the
people
and
to
take
the
locked
suitcase
down
to
the
station
house.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
there,
you
say
there
was
a
warrant
needed
to
open
up
the
suitcase.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
limited
and
rather
narrow
question
of
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was,
really,
in
this
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
practical
matter
if
there
had
been
nothing
incriminatory
inside
that
suitcase,
the
respondents
would
have
consented
to
the
search
and
you
wouldn't
have
any
exigent
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
delay.
