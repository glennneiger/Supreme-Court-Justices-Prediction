we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
arkansas
against
sanders.
mr.
purvis,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
the
exigent
circumstances
here
that
distinguish
it
from
chadwick?
you'll
tell
us
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
terry
aspect
that
you
might
want
to
search
in
the
glove
compartment
to
see
if
the
driver
had
a
45-automatic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
he
could
get
in
the
glove
compartment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
relate
this
again
to
the
terry
concept
that
you're
entitled
to
make
a
prophylactic
search
to
see
if
there's
a
45-automatic
in
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
in
the
position
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
in
the
possession
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
seat
of
the
driver
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
certainly
takes
the
position
from
your
predicate
that
you
can
search
the
driver
himself
to
see
whether
he
had
a
45-automatic
somewhere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
i
should
tell
you,
you're
into,
i
think,
four
minutes
of
your
rebuttal
that
you
wanted
to
save.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lassiter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lassiter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we've
been
talking
about
the
automobile
exception.
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
an
automobile
search
exception
with
respect
to
a
private
car
and
to
a
common
carrier?
the
taxicab
is
a
common
carrier,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
pursue
that
by
saying,
to
take
the
illustration,
the
hypothetical
justice
white
posed,
about
the
highjacked
truck
which
has
stolen
a
piano
and
the
driver
is
part
of
that
operation.
there,
you
have
not
a
common
carrier
but
a
private
car.
would
you
say
that
you
could
search
the
glove
compartment
as
well
as
searching
the
back
of
the
car
to
see
if
the
piano
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
not
stolen.
it's
just
a
private
truck,
a
private
highjacker
and
there
is,
indeed,
a
stolen
piano
or
several
stolen
pianos,
as
you
would
have
it,
but
can
they
search
the
glove
compartment
and
the
rest
of
the
car
to
see
if
he's
got
a
45-automatic,
a
prophylactic
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
the
concept
of
terry
indicate
that
you
could
make
that
prophylactic
search?
it
wouldn't
be
much
profit
in
finding
that
a
piano
or
two
pianos
in
the
trunk
if
the
driver,
meanwhile,
could
go
and
get
a
45-automatic
out
of
his
glove
compartment
or
somewhere
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
attack
the
officers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
when
you
stop
the
truck
with
the
piano,
you
can
search
the
entire
truck
to
see
if
there's
a
weapon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
can't
have
the
rule
of
law
applicable
depending
on
the
sequence
of
events,
whether
they
took
the
man
--
the
driver
in
handcuffs
before
they
had
determined
that
he
had
the
stolen
piano.
aren't
they
entitled
to
make
a
prophylactic
search
as
soon
as
they
have
probable
cause
to
stop
the
private
car
as
distinguished
from
a
common
carrier?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hasn't
the
court
gone
beyond
that
in
terry,
among
other
cases,
that
not
only
--
in
terry,
they
could
search
the
person.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which,
is
a
much
greater
invasion
of
privacy
than
searching
the
glove
compartment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
it
was
bulky
enough
to
have
a
few
thousand
dollars
worth
of
heroine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
be
in
several
government
bonds
or
it
might
be
some
heroine.
could
you
open
it
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
term
“reasonable”
in
the
fourth
amendment
means
reasonable
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case
with
all
the
new
ones
that
may
occur
in
the
variations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
define
them
very
well
up
to
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
one
has
been
able
to
define
them
precisely
up
to
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
lassiter.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
purvis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
there
is
a
difference
between
a
common
carrier
and
a
private
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
common
carrier
might
be
a
taxi
which
you
have
commandeered
exclusively
or
you
might
share
it
with
2
other
passengers,
or
it
might
be
a
bus
in
which
you
share
it
with
50
or
100.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
