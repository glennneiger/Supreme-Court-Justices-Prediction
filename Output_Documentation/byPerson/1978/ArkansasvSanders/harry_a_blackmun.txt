justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
purvis,
aren't
there
really
two
kinds
of
situations
that
might
possibly
call
for
different
rules?
one
is
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
somewhere
in
a
vehicle,
maybe
in
luggage,
maybe
in
the
trunk,
maybe
in
the
glove
compartment
there
is
contraband.
and,
another
case
where
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
it's
in
a
specific
piece
of
luggage
and
you
know
there's
nothing
else
in
the
taxicab.
do
you
think
you
should
apply
the
same
rule
to
both
of
those
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
hypothetical
about
a
truck
containing
a
piano.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
take
the
position
that
that
would
authorize
a
search
of
the
glove
compartment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
just
the
automobile
exception.
under
your
understanding
of
the
automobile
exception,
knowing
that
a
piano
is
in
the
truck
would
justify
a
search
of
the
glove
compartment.
that's
your
view,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
have
an
extreme
view.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
only
the
cab
driver
has
standing
there.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
only
the
cab
driver
has
standing
to
object
opening
the
trunk
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
he
consented
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
unless
he
paid
for
the
cab
fare,
i
don't
think.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
unless
he
paid
the
fare,
under
rakas
that
is.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
purvis,
assume
that
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
--
i'm
sorry.
i
have
one
more
question
for
mr.
purvis.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
assume
that
the
police
had
--
i
got
your
name
wrong.
i'm
sorry.
probable
cause
to
believe
that,
say,
they'd
listen
to
some
--
intercept
with
some
telephone
conversations
and
one
of
the
spokesmen
said
“we
will
deliver
contraband
from
point
a
to
point
b
in
a
certain
vehicle,”
and
they
don't
tell
whether
it's
going
to
be
in
luggage
or
what,
but
it
would
be
somewhere
in
that
vehicle
at
that
time.
the
police
have
strong
reason
to
believe
that's
true.
they
stop
the
vehicle
and,
inside
the
vehicle,
there's
this
green
suitcase.
would
you
agree
that
under
the
automobile
search
exception
they
could
then
search
the
luggage?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
would
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
you
don't
know
whether
it's
in
the
luggage
or
not.
it's
different
from
this
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
problem,
i
suppose,
would
be
that
they
would
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
it
was
within
any
particular
suitcase.
it
might
not
--
it
might
be
concealed
under
the
--
in
the
tires,
in
the
roof
of
the
car,
any
sort
of
place
like
that.
so,
how
could
they
ever
get
a
warrant
to
search
the
piece
of
luggage
unless
they
could
say
it's
part
of
an
overall
search
of
the
vehicle?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
purvis,
would
it
be
the
same
case
if,
instead
of
getting
in
a
taxicab,
they
got
on
a
bus
or
subway?
