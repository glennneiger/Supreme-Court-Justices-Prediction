how
can
you
say
you'll
search
in
the
vehicle,
which
is
a
taxicab,
when
you're
searching
a
bag
which
the
taxi
company
doesn't
own,
the
taxi
driver
doesn't
own?
you're
searching
the
suitcase.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
respondent
complain
about
the
search
into
the
cab?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
no,
he
doesn't
complain
about
that
at
all,
does
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
why
do
you
keep
saying
that
they
had
the
right
to
search
the
cab?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
take
that
and
you
search
all
beings
and
you
search
everything
in
it
and
open
it
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
a
double-locked
locker?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
there
was
a
double-locked
trunk
in
a
car,
could
you
search
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
opening
the
lock
and
breaking
the
lock?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
wouldn't
hurt
chadwick
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
ignore
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
ignore
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
like
to
ask
which
one
is
apple
and
which
is
orange.
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me.
you
said
popped
open,
of
its
own
volition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me,
i
missed
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
misunderstood
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
opening
the
bag?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
for
stopping
the
cab?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
were
the
exigent
circumstances
why
they
couldn't
have
carried
the
bag
to
the
police
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
station
or
some
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
couldn't
you
have
gotten
a
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
any
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
a
whole
lot
of
leeway.
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
well,
after
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
this
chase
was
over
and
the
car,
the
motor
had
cooled
off,
could
they
have
gotten
the
warrant
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
motor
was
still
hot,
could
they
have
gotten
it
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
exigent
circumstance
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
could
not
get
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
you
could
search
anything
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
have
broken
open
a
safe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
he
couldn't
get
if
it
was
in
the
trunk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know.
you're
the
one
talking
apples
and
oranges.
i'm
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
answer
to
me
that
it's
apples
and
oranges
is
pretty
in
effective
in
that
you
talk
old
apples
and
old
oranges.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
as
i
understand
it,
once
you
stop
it,
once
you
have
a
reason
to
stop
the
vehicle,
you
have
the
right
to
search
everything
in
--
everybody
and
everything
in
that
vehicle.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
you
were
looking
for
a
diamond
ring,
you
have
the
right
to
rip
open
the
suitcase
in
the
trunk,
wouldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
imagine,
the
shoes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
restrictions
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
cab
driver.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
officers
had
a
perfect
right
to
take
that
trunk
--
that
suitcase
out
of
the
trunk,
don't
you
admit
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
not
to
open
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
the
police
have
put
in
the
back
and
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
they
put
it
in
the
back
of
their
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
lock
it
with
their
key?
justice
thurgood
marshall
“and
i'll
open
it
for
you.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
that
there's
no
constitutional
issue
involved?
isn't
it
the
fact
that
when
you
arrest
a
man,
you
look
at
everything
he
has
solely
for
the
purpose
if
inventory,
and
that's
the
excuse?
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
litigation
about
it.
they
do
it
and
they
say
they're
doing
it
for
inventory,
and
both
sides
agree
that
it's
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
when
a
man
is
arrested
he
can't
be
searched
before
he's
put
in
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
you
don't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
can
be
searched.
