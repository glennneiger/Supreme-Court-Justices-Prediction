f.
powell,
jr.
general,
the
suitcase
in
this
case
was
unlocked,
wasn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
your
view,
does
that
make
a
difference
so
far
as
chadwick
is
concerned?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
lassiter,
i
take
it
from
what
you've
said
that
you
think
the
proper
procedure
would've
been
for
the
police
to
take
the
suitcase
to
headquarters
and
obtain
a
warrant
there.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
i
--
do
you
agree
that
there
would've
been
sufficient
probable
cause
for
the
magistrate
to
issue
a
warrant?
well,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
there
was
such
probable
cause.
i
would
suspect
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and,
if
the
suitcase
in
fact
had
been
empty
of
any
contraband,
in
other
words
if
there
was
nothing
incriminating
in
it,
your
client
would've
been
more
inconvenienced
by
having
it
taken
to
the
station
house
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
having
it
opened
on
the
spot.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
as
privacy
interest
in
contraband?
