justice
john
paul
stevens
general
purvis,
if
i
understand
your
theory
correctly,
in
chadwick
you
would
say
the
automobile
exception
would've
applied
if
the
agents
have
waited
a
few
moments
until
they
put
the
footlocker
into
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
then
started
the
motor.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
still
would've
fit
in
the
trunk,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they'd
started
the
motor,
it'd
be
precisely
like
this
car.
and
in
your
example
about
this
case,
the
car
wasn't
moving
when
they
got
in.
the
taxi
wasn't
moving
when
they
put
the
suitcase
into
the
taxi,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
is
this
a
question
of
a
different
point
in
time
when
the
officers
chose
to
make
the
search,
isn't
that
the
only
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could've
--
presumably,
they
knew
about
the
description
of
the
luggage
when
they
put
it
in
the
trunk
here.
if
they
had
grabbed
it
right
before
they
put
it
in
the
trunk,
then
it'd
be
exactly
like
chadwick,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
then
there
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
when
he
picked
the
suitcase
up,
they
could've
seized
it
right
then,
couldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
couldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
not
have
picked
and
seized
the
suitcase
when
he
picked
it
up,
right
at
the
moment
you
just
described?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
purvis,
let
me
go
back
to
a
question
the
chief
justice
asked
you
about
what
were
the
exigent
circumstances
and
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas'
opinion,
they
say,
with
the
suitcase
safely
immobilized,
it
was
--
there
was
no
risk
that
the
evidence
might
be
lost.
what
were
the
exigent
circumstances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
may
be,
but
i
didn't
really
hear
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
i
haven't
heard
you
address
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
were
the
exigent
circumstances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
think
he
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lassiter,
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
if
we
treat
this
as
an
automobile
exception
case
and
therefore
you
have
an
objection
raised
by
two
passengers
to
the
search
or
one
passenger,
i
don't
think
your
client
has
standing
to
object
to
the
search
of
the
suitcase.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
what
about
the
other
things
on
the
spectrum?
you've
just
mentioned
the
briefcase.
suppose
it's
just
a
shoebox
and
then
you
get
into
a
woman's
handbag
and
--
you
can
say
this
--
that
isn't
this
case,
but
we
have
to
think
about
these,
don't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
go
through
even
six
locked
containers,
each
within
the
other,
on
one
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
your
court
unanimous
in
those
cases?
