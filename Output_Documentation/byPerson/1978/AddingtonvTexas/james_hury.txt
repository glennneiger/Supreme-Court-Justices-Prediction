mr.
james
hury
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
texas
that
i
humbly
represent
here
concerning
the
due
process
question.
and
we
feel
that
the
question
involving
the
statute
are
the
provisions
as
recognized
by
the
state
of
texas
concerning
reasonable
doubt
or
preponderance
does
not
exist
in
a
vacuum.
the
due
process
that
is
followed
by
the
state
of
texas
does
not
hinge
on
the
question
of
whether
it
should
be
preponderance
of
the
evidence
or
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
hinges,
we
feel,
on
the
other
necessities
of
due
process
which
are
granted
in
this
particular
case
and
indeed
every
case
of
someone
who
used
to
be
committed
in
the
state
of
texas.
the
whole
procedure
does
not
begin
merely
from
the
question
of
indefinite
commitment.
the
procedure
begins
basically
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
temporary
commitment
should
be
allowed
and
it
indeed
is
necessary
for
temporary
commitment
before
indefinite
commitment.
a
person
or
a
physician
must
notify
court
that
physician
or
persons
must
be
recognized
by
that
court
and
that
court
then
sets
aside
two
physicians
who
are
responsible
for
evaluating
the
condition
of
the
person
who
is
to
be
evaluated.
and
then
you
have
a
notice,
have
a
hearing
before
a
judge
and
maybe
committed
for
some
90
days
in
the
texas
mental
health
hospital.
the
judge
is
able
to
stop
this
proceeding
at
any
point
up
until
the
time
that
the
person
has
entered
into
that
procedure
and
indeed
upon
entering
the
particular
mental
institution
he
could
be
discharged
immediately.
in
the
event
that
a
person
is
discharged
and
comes
before
a
judge
again
concerning
his
mental
capacity,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
temporary
commitment
will
not
be
tried
again,
and
indeed
it
has
in
this
particular
case
there
were
some
eight
temporary
commitments.
mr.
james
hury
my
understanding
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
there
is
a
minimum
requirement
of
two
mandatory
reviews
or
one
mandatory
review
every
six
months
or
two
per
year.
i
do
believe
in
just
my
own
knowledge
that
there
is
considerably
more
than
that.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
of
texas
allows
someone
to
languish
in
a
building
somewhere
and
only
see
them
once
every
six
months.
i
am
prepared
to
represent
and
i
believe
that
we
provide
them
with
competent
psychiatric
evaluation
as
much
as
possible
or
as
much
as
the
facilities
allow
that
they
are
under
psychiatric
evaluation
and
indeed
that
the
drugs
and
the
treatment
which
are
recognized
by
the
medical
society
is
trying
to
help
these
people.
the
indefinite
commitment
which--
there
were
two
in
this
particular
case
follows
a
sworn
petition
which
is
presented
by
the
judge
again
two
–-
in
this
case
two
psychiatrists
and
i
believe
it
is
required
that
at
least
one
be
a
psychiatrist
that
must
evaluate
this
person
within
15
days
of
a
hearing
of
this
particular
type.
an
attorney
can
and
is
almost
and
i
believe
is
always
provided
that
seven
days
before
the
particular
hearing
notice
must
be
given
again,
a
jury
is
available
and
indeed
at
the
end
of
that
particular
procedure
if
after
a
jury
verdict,
a
judge
does
not
agree
with
that
verdict
he
might
order
the
return
of
the
lawsuit
to
another
jury
in
ordering
a
new
trial.
this
particular
procedure,
it
is
the
hope
of
the
state
of
texas,
forms
the
basis
for
an
entire
evaluation
of
some
possibility
of
whether
or
not
this
person
does
represent
a
danger
to
himself
or
others
and
indeed
try
in
some
way
to
make
this
person
available
once
again
to
society.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
question
involved
here
does
involve
some
loss
of
liberty.
the
idea
is
whether
or
not
this
loss
of
liberty
is
analogous
to
a
penal
institution
and
that
loss
of
liberty
being
a
total
and
complete
deprivation
of
liberty
for
a
specified
period
of
time.
it
is
only
pointed
out
that
we
do
feel
that
the
procedures
whereby
the
commitment
is
-–
the
committed
person
is
evaluated
and
indeed
the
very
possibility
that
upon
the
day
of
his
admission
he
could
be
released,
points
to
the
idea
among
other
things
that
this
is
not
analogous
to
a
prison,
it
is
not
analogous
to
a
set
period
of
time
in
which
a
person
must
languish
in
prison
before
his
release
even
considering
parole.
the
provisions
of
the
mental
health
codes
and
the
mental
health
provisions
of
these
hospitals
does
not
render
this
a
prison.
it
renders
it
a
place
where
we
hope
will
assume
small
success
to
be
able
to
help
people.
i
think
there's
another
basic
problem
here
as
to
whether
or
not
the
person
who
is
considered
for
both
procedures,
the
criminal
procedure
and
the
civil
commitment
procedure,
whether
or
not
that
person
is
of
a
mind
to
be
able
to
adequately
decide
what
is
best
for
that
person.
the
thought
or
idea
of
a
culpable
defendant
in
a
criminal
matter
conspicuously
concern
someone
who
is
available
to
input
by
counsel,
by
other
persons
who
are
trying
to
represent
that
person
before
a
court
of
law,
his
ability
to
evaluate
his
position
and
his
possibilities
while
confronted
with
the
state
are
available
to
a
person
who
we
can
--
who
the
system
assumes
is
culpable
if
there's
no
question
of
psychiatric
problem
raised.
the
problem
i
think
is
particularly
available
as
to
what
in
the
world
are
we
going
to
do
with
someone
who
does
not
completely
understand
what's
going
on
about
him,
as
to
someone
whose
ability
to
evaluate
his
ability
to
proceed
in
life,
his
ability
to
understand
what
the
people
around
him
need
in
addition
to
his
own
need,
and
i
think
the
particular
problem
here
is
that
if
a
person
does
not
wish
to
seek
help
that
the
first
problem
in
effective
treatment
is
to
getting
that
person
into
a
position
where
he
acknowledges
that
he
does
have
a
problem
and
that
he
is
suffering
from
some
abnormal
condition.
if
this
particular
provision
can
be
met,
and
it
is
the
hope
that
after
a
person
realizes
that
he
has
a
problem,
then
the
procedures
under
which
this
state
of
texas
proceeds
is
of
hopeful
nature
that
it
would
return
this
person
to
some
sort
of
usable
place
in
society.
mr.
james
hury
as
a
question
of
whether
it's
intolerant
or
not,
the
problem
i
think
pointed
out
by
the
state
of
texas,
and
once
again
just
pointing
to
turner,
is
one
of
the
inexact
nature
of
psychiatric
testimony,
the
inability
of
certain
forms
of
the
medical
profession
to
predict
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
future,
and
as
to
whether
or
not
that
particular
ability
to
predict
is
available
to
the
question
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
think
what
it
will
certainly
do
sir
is
to
reduce
the
number
of
people
who
are
committed
to
treatment
because
of
the
ability
of
counsel
to
cross
examine
a
psychiatrist
and
to
have
him
admit
that
not
all
psychiatrists
agree
on
what
is
to
happen
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
james
hury
yes,
sir
without
a
doubt.
mr.
james
hury
it's
our
position
that
in
denying
certain
abilities
to
prove
certain
things
that
is
that
there
are
certain
standards
that
would
be
much
more
difficult
to
meet,
that
there
are
people
who
would
be
excluded
from
that
process.
mr.
james
hury
it
is
being
done;
it
is
already
the
standard
in
several
states.
mr.
james
hury
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
hury
the
opposite
argument
is
of
course
is
valid.
the
only
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
to
is
that
this
question
does
not
exist
in
a
vacuum,
that
there
are
other
things,
which
are
available
to
be
proved.
there
are
certain
concrete
things
that
can
be
proved
concerning
a
person's
past
history.
it
is
particularly
the
problem
of
predicting
future
problems
that
come
within
the
psychiatric
problems
that
you
are
talking
about.
mr.
james
hury
i
believe
it
does
sir.
mr.
james
hury
there
is
some
analogy
there
and
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
we
believe
that
there
is
some
ability
to
predict
some
types
of
future
behavior.
the
parole
situation
does
in
effect
place
some
very
serious
limitations
on
a
person's
movements
upon
their
release
from
the
penitentiary,
and
i
would
say
that
would
be
the
only
difference.
mr.
james
hury
i
agree
that
there
is
some
similarity,
but
i
think
the
difference
here
is
that
psychiatric
testimony
in
the
form
of
the
mentally
committed
person
is
much
less
predictable
than
a
mere
idea
of
whether
or
not
a
person
is
going
to
back
into
a
situation
where
they
have
committed
crimes
before.
mr.
james
hury
i
definitely
agree
with
you
your
honor.
mr.
james
hury
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
james
hury
the
--
having
taken
part
in
these
particular
procedures,
i
guess
of
course
i
am
skewed
in
one
direction
or
another,
but
there
is
another
side
to
some
of
these
procedures,
which
myself
as
–
mr.
james
hury
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
providing
the
other
safeguards
that
we
provide,
it
does
satisfy
the
due
process.
mr.
james
hury
some
of
the
states
even
illinois
suggest
that
clear
and
convincing
is
the
same
thing
as
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
only
in
a
civil
sector.
i
am
not
too
sure
whether
or
not
there
is
an
absolute
definition
of
what
clear
and
convincing
is,
but
–
mr.
james
hury
i
think
that
there
is
a
historical
usage
of
preponderance
and
we
would
ask
to
able
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
james
hury
i
agree
with
the
court,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
hury
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
james
hury
i
believe
that
so
far
as
the
state
of
texas
is
concerned
that
it
has
been
a
usage
to
use
the
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
and
indeed--
mr.
james
hury
yes
sir.
mr.
james
hury
yes
sir.
mr.
james
hury
only
by
hoping
that
we
all
act
under
the
same
mental
health
code
that
is
enacted
by
the
legislature
but
the
--
in
particularly
the
two
cases
which
were
decided
in
this
question
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
texas,
turner
and
addington
were
both--
mr.
james
hury
yes
sir.
those
were
decided
on
clear
and
convincing
in
the
lower
court
and
were
in
a
short
sentence
in
the
bit,
the
end
of
the--
mr.
james
hury
no
sir
they
did
not
and
here
again
just
as
a
person
who
has
taken
part
in
it,
we
would
ask
to
be
able
to
prove
it
by
preponderance.
mr.
james
hury
that's
what
was
submitted
by
lower
court
but
the
supreme
court
said
that
in
the
future
they
direct
those
courts
to
have
a
preponderance
of
evidence
as
the
criteria
from
their
own,
as
mentioned
in
virtue
of
the
last
paragraph
of
the
state
of
texas',
the
supreme
court's
opinion.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
wish
to
reserve
time
for
maybe
week
or
so.
thank
you.
