f.
powell,

may
i
ask
you
a
question,
it's
somewhat
similar
to
justice
stewart's
question.
suppose
you
had
statute
that
required
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
three
facts,
one
mental
illness,
two
some
past
act
of
violence
and
thirdly
say
that
in
that
commitment
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
patient.
i
assume
that
would
be
a
perfectly
constitutionally
statute
in
your
view,
if
those
were
the
three
substantive
requirements?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now
supposing
if--
after
that
statute
was
enacted
constitutionally,
legislature
said,
“well,
we
are
going
to
add
a
fourth
requirement
that
there
be
a
prediction
of
future
dangerousness
either
to
the
person
himself
or
to
others.
but
that
fourth
requirement
shall
only
be
required
to
be
required
to
proof
of
beyond--
clear
and
convincing
evidence.”
the
statute
has
now
become
unconstitutional
by
your
analysis
even
though
it's
more
protective
of
the
person.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
it
cannot
include
the
last
criteria
under
your
analysis
unless
it
requires
proof
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
that
element
of
the
determination.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
ms.
boston
what
is
it,
that
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
your
new
mentally
retarded
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
predictive
isn't
it?
and
that
has
to
be
proved
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
is
that
differ
from
the
issue
we
have
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what's
the
nature
of
the
trial
under
that
statute,
jury
or
non
jury?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
just
read
it
to
us
that's
wholly
predictive
element
isn't
it
noting
else?
