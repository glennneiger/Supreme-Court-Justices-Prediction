justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
the
standard
of
proof
that
the
texas
court
thought
should
obtain?
justice
byron
r.
white
preponderance
would
be
all
right
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
preponderance
standard,
is
that--
that
is
constitutional
in
your--?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
clear
and
convincing
has
been
adopted
by
many
states
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
preponderance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
substantive
standard
does
depend
in
part
on
a
past
act,
a
historical
fact,
which
way
would
you
run
the
argument
a
lower
or
a
higher
standard
of
proof
should
be
required.
you
say
if
it's
a
past
act
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
argument,
your
argument
in
a
way
is
that
the
standard
of
proof
should
--
depends
to
some
extent
on
the
substantive
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
way
do
you
run
it,
the
looser
the
standard,
the
looser
the
standard--
what
should
happen
to
the
burden
of
proof
then
or
the
standard
of
proof
go
up
or
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
so
that
the
standard
you
choose
really
doesn't
depend
on
the
substantive
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
a
substantive
standard
shouldn't
affect
the
standard
of
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
some
of
the
arguments
in
the
briefs
at
file
the
--
are
that
the
looser
the
standard
the
higher
--
the
looser
the
substantive
ground,
the
higher
the
standard
of
proof
because
the
more
margin
for
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
lower
standard
of
proof
means
the
possibility
of
more
error,
we
ought
to
just
put
up
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
consequences
of
error
are
not
as
disagreeable
as
in
the
criminal.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
klein
you
are
arguing
as
i
understand
that
if
we--
unless
we
lower
the
standard,
have
a
relatively
low
standard,
there
will
people
who
will
go
free
who
ought
to
be
committed?
isn't
the
adverse
also
true
that
if
you
have
a
low
standard,
there
will
be
people
who
will
be
committed
who
should
not
be
committed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
must--
what
you
are
saying
it's
better
to
accept
the
risk
of
a
significant
number
of
people
being
erroneously
committed
than
the
other
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
one
does
not
in
fact
satisfy
the
standard
of
danger
to
himself
or
others
or
being
mentally
ill.
i
suppose
you
can
be
wrong
about
the
mental
illness.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
disagree
with
the
essence
of
the
statistical
material
in
the
brief
i
referred
to
earlier
about
the
probabilities?
are
you
familiar
with
what
i'm
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
in
your
judgment
or
the
judgment
of
your
client,
what
is
the
probability
that
a
prediction
of
dangerousness
to
oneself
or
others
by
psychiatrist
will
be
accurate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
within
the
meaning
of
the
texas
standard,
how
reliably
can
you
predict
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then
you
would
say
to
me
you
are
necessarily
conceding
that
if
you
have
a
low
standard
of
proof
there
maybe
30
or
40%
of
the
people
that
are
committed,
that
should
not
be
committed.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
if
then--
if
the
dangerousness
is
not
critical,
you're
really
saying
you
are
acting
for
the
benefit
of
the
patient,
you
need
a
low
standard
of
proof
because
he
doesn't
know
what's
good
for
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
has
to
be
a
determination
for
mental
retardation.
