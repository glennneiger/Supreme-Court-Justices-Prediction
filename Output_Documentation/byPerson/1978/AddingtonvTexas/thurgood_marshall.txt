ms.
boston
assuming
the
case
in
texas
and
you
have
three
equivalent
psychiatrists
of
equivalent
standards,
i
recognize,
i
didn't
know
two
were
exactly
alike,
but
there
are
three
of
equivalent
standing
on
each
side.
three
will
say
yes
and
three
will
say
no.
how
in
the
world
will
a
layman
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
it
were
a
criminal
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
a
layman
do
that
without
any
help?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
average
person
without
a
motive
can
find
out
that
this
is
a
schizophrenic
person?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you'd
at
least
have
to
tell
him
what
a
schizophrenic
person
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
believe
the
state
could
commit
without
a
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
have
--
many
states
can
still
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
on
the
written
statement
of
two
members
of
the
medical
profession
even
if
they
are
obstetricians.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
eye
specialists.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
important
is
that?
i
don't
think
if
you
take
them
on
the
other
states,
--
you
want
to
stick
with
texas.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
to
change
it
to
beyond
a
reason
of
doubt,
intolerant
to
the
state
of
texas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
also
true
in
a
criminal
case
but
you
have
to
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
this,
it's
your
position
that
you
can't
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
impossible,
it
could
be
done.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hury
i
notice
you're
from
galveston,
you're
local.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
speak
for
el
paso
or
any
place
else
in
texas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
those
are
the
two
in
your
brief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
what
you
are
saying
now
is
that
you
don't
have
to
use
the
words
“beyond
a
reasonable
doubt”
will
you
go
that
for?
because
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
about
the
judges'
instructions.
it
seemed
to
me,
they
went
a
little
further
than
preponderance,
but
they
didn't
go
to
reasonable
doubt.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
telling
us
that
as
the
state
court
say,
the
only
ones
you
know
are
the
two,
say
that
that's
okay
and
that's
what's
expected
a
little
bit
more
than
preponderance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
you
keep
developing
this
than
you
can
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
if
you
say
this
man
is
so
violent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
it's
your
submission
then
in
this
case
texas
could
without
any
problem
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
support
commitment
without
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
want
to
leave
it
to
the
states.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
could
not
do
with
the
due
process
clause?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
maryland?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
maryland
change?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
didn't
change
last
time
it
was
in
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
get
a
psychiatrist
to
testify
and
say
in
these
words
that,
“i
make
this
diagnosis
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
--”
have
you
heard
psychiatrist
say
anything
close
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
always
say,
“well,
on
the
other
hand--”
justice
thurgood
marshall
back
to
my
original
point
--
i
mean
get
with
this--
