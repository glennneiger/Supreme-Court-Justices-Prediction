does
texas
provide
any
periodic
review?
justice
potter
stewart
has
the
appellant
sort
that
review?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
have
been
six
month
reviews?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
you
tell
us
again
what
the
standard
is
in
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
an
opinion,
that's
a
predictive
opinion
rather
than
any
factual
determination,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reason
i
asked
my
question
ms.
boston
is
that
it
occurs
to
me
that
what
standard
of
proof
may
be
required
is
inevitably
connected
with
what
the
standards
are
for
involuntary
commitment
in
any
particular
state.
if
they're
historic
factual
standards,
it
may
be
one
thing.
if
they
are
opinion
standards,
or
experts,
it
might
be
something
else.
and
if
it's
a
very
strict
standard
before
substantively
before
a
person
can
be
involuntarily
committed,
it
may
be
one
thing.
if
it's
very
a
loose,
slow
threshold,
it
may
be
something
else.
doesn't
matter
this
substantive
criteria
for
involuntary
commitments
and
each
state
or
court
i
suppose
is
different.
justice
potter
stewart
it
isn't
there
where
perhaps
the
real
constitutional
wise
might
lie.
it
would
certainly
--
there
areâ€”it
metes
and
bounds
--
the
constitutional
metes
and
bounds
i
suppose
which
a
state
could
not
exceed,
it
couldn't
say
that
anybody
with
hair
of
a
certain
color
should
be
involuntarily
committed.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn't
that
depend
on
what
is
necessary
to
show
before
somebody
can
be
involuntary
committed,
aren't
the
two
just
inevitably
connected?
justice
potter
stewart
can
one
say,
can
one
say
for
the
nation
of
fifty
states,
fifty
individual
states
each
with
different
standards
for
involuntary
commitment
that
the
constitution
requires
a
certain
level
of
proof
because
doesn't
the
level
of
proof
isn't
it
as
i
say
inexorably
connected
with
what
the
substantive
criteria
are
for
involuntary
commitment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
generally
those
are
historic
facts
we're
talking
about
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
other
things.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they're
giving
their
expert
opinions.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
a
state
said
that
anybody
can
be
involuntarily
committed
in
our
state,
if
in
the
opinion
of
two
qualified
psychiatrist,
he
should
be?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
were
the
substantive
standards
for
involuntary
commitment,
now
where's
your
burden
of
proof
there
if
two
qualified
psychiatrists
simply
testified
on
opinion
he
should
be
involuntary
committed.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
a
state
did
do
that
as
a
matter
of
a
substantive
law
of
involuntary
commitment?
justice
potter
stewart
then
there
would
be
no
question
of
burden
of
proof,
the
question
would
be
are
those
substantive
standards
constitutionally
permissible?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
suggest
though
that
what
is
in
question
is
the
burden
of
proof,
i
mean
that's
the
what
does
a
constitution
require
by
a
way
of
burden
of
proof
and
my
suggestion
and
my
question
is
that
there
maybe
no
one
answer
applicable
to
50
different
states
because
each
state
has
different
criteria
for
involuntary
commitment.
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
many
states,
well
they
may
have
a
hearing
they
don't
have
a
jury
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
trail
would
be
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
states
have
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
claim
here--
justice
potter
stewart
is
a
due
process
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
am
saying
it
is
a
due
process
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
case
here.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
