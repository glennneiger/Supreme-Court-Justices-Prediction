mr.
hury,
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
one
for
the
national
center
for
law
and
the
handicapped
makes
the
argument
that
the
unreliability
of
predictions
cuts
the
other
way.
that
if
you
have
a
low
standard
of
proof,
it
means
that
there
will
be
a
lot
people
committed
who
really
should
not
be
committed
because
psychiatrists
tend
to
over
predict
dangerousness
and
the
like
in
order
to
be
conservative.
i'm
just
wondering,
isn't
there
some
force
to
that
suggestion
that
the
whole
fact
that
it
is
quite
an
unreliable
and
uncertain
area
is
a
reason
for
not
putting
â€“
not
depriving
people
of
their
liberty
on
doubtful
evidence.
justice
harry

this
problem
would
be
avoided
if
you
adopted
a
system
such
as
wisconsin
has
relying
on
past
acts
rather
than
opinions
as
to
what
might
happen
in
the
future
that
i
guess
part
of
it
really
relates
to
the
substantive
standards
doesn't
it?
