justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
boston
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
you
do
not
here
press
the
contention
that
although
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
requirement
might
not
be
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
is
a
requirement
that
a
proof
be
at
least
by
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
makes
you
think
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
don't
you
think
though
that
the
rule
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
was
applied
at
winship,
had
great
historical
roots
in
the
common
law
as
proof
for
a
criminal
case.
whereas
clear
and
convincing
evidence
simply
comes
over
from
the
fraud
type
of
case
and
a
civil
action,
it's
a
fairly
recent
origin
and
so
far
as
i
know
it
hasn't
been
implanted
in
the
constitution
historically.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
comes
a
point
doesn't
it
when
the
jury's
eyes
just
glaze
even
on
charges
on
the
substantive
issues
if
the
judge
goes
on
for
20
or
25
minutes
as
he
usually
does
and
the
difference
between
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
often
lost
on
jury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
the
court,
i
am
the
one
thatâ€“
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klein
he
does
that
i
take
it
whether
the
offense
with
which
he
is
charged
is
subject
to
a
six
months
penalty
or
death
penalty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
the
consequences
of
error
and
erroneously
sentencing
somebody
to
a
six-month
sentence
are
considerably
different
than
the
consequences
of
error
in
sentencing
someone
to
death
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understood,
and
let
me
say
that
there
a
lot
of
mentally
ill
people
who
have
not
committed
acts
of
violence
and
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
they
get
help.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
saying
that
a
past
act
is
constitutionally
required
as
a
substantive
element
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
it
become
pretty
much
mandatory
if
your
view
is
adopted
in
order
to
get
anybody
committed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is--
the
defendant
convicted
under
that
system
doesn't
get
a
one
year
reevaluation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
someone
who
has
gone
through
a
five
day
jury
trial
as
your
client
did
here
and
been
acquitted
after
all
the
testimony
and
the
evidence
are
found
not
mentally
ill
would
be
welcomed
back
into
the
bosom
of
society
so
to
speak?
