mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
today
representing
the
american
psychiatric
association
as
amicus
curiae.
this
court
is
well
aware
that
psychiatrist
who
play
a
critical
role
in
the
actual
civil
commitment
preceding,
and
based
on
the
experience,
with
the
association
and
its
members,
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
constitutionalize
the
burden
of
proof
in
civil
commitment.
we
do
so
largely
for
the
reasons
that
i
think
were
being
suggested
by
mr.
justice
stevens
when
he
asked
about
the
relationship
between
criteria
and
substantive
burden
of
proof
that
is
a
substance
of
criteria
in
the
burden
of
proof.
it
seems
to
me
as
the
court
recognized
in
patterson
versus
new
york,
only
the
term
before
last,
that
if
you
lock
in
a
burden
of
proof,
you
in
many
ways
limit
the
discretion
of
a
state
in
terms
of
its
criteria
from
liberalizing,
from
changing,
from
beginning
to
cope
with
new
and
different
ways
to
deal
with
difficult
and
intractable
problems
such
as
mental
health
and
involuntary
commitment.
now
as
mr.
hury
has
made
claim
from
the
state
of
texas,
this
is
not
a
gault
typed
case.
texas
gives
civil
committees
a
great
deal
of
due
process
including
a
jury
trail.
in
this
particular
case,
this
patient
had
a
five
day
jury
trail
with
i
think
as
many
as
12
to
14
witnesses.
the
single
question
is
whether
one
procedure
should
be
mandated
to
cut
across
the
board
in
all
50
states
in
civil
commitment?
now
there
is
the
simple
analogy
to
winship
and
juvenile
proceedings
that
appellant
relies
on.
i
think
the
analogy
doesn't
hold
water,
and
i
think
so
for
the
following
reason.
after
gault,
the
juvenile
proceeding
was
in
fact
formulized.
you
then
had
the
issue
of
the
burden
of
proof,
that
wasn't
going
to
change
the
proceeding
by
and
large
that
was
simply
going
to
require
more
evidence
and
protect
against
an
erroneous
conviction
of
a
criminal
charge.
however
when
you
go
to
mckeever
the
court
would
not
constitutionalize
the
jury
trial
requirement
and
it
didn't
do
so
because
it
was
concerned
that
a
jury
trial
would
affect
the
juvenile
justice
system
in
a
way
perhaps
that
the
burden
of
proof
would
not
and
that
was
because
it
would
strip
the
juvenile
judge
of
his
role.
now
if
we
turn
to
civil
commitment,
i
think
the
same
thing
applies
when
we
are
talking
about
burden
of
proof
that
is
i
think
it's
much
more
analogous
to
a
jury
trial
requirement.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
as
follows.
it
seems
to
me
unlike
a
juvenile
delinquency
determination
a
civil
commitment
spans
a
host
of
different
criteria.
juvenile
delinquency
deals
with
the
commission
of
a
criminal
act.
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
well
suited
to
prove
past
acts.
civil
commitment
deals
with
a
variety
of
things
in
a
variety
of
states.
some
of
which
do
focus
quite
strongly
on
dangerousness
and
actually
require
as
wisconsin
does
proof
of
a
passed
over
it
act
that
it
seems
to
me
as
a
legislative
decision
and
perhaps
one
that
the
legislature
can
responsibly
make
based
on
its
experience,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
should
lock
that
process
in
by
mandating
a
high
burden
of
proof.
the
effects
–
mr.
joel
i.
klein
to
the
extent
it's
a
past
act,
it's
certainly
more
feasible
to
prove
by
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
there's
no
doubt,
but
my
argument
would
be
that
the
constitution
shouldn't
require
that
because
the
state
can
then
address
its
standard
of
proof
to
the
given
criteria.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
the
standard
of
proof
affects
it,
not
that
it
depends
upon,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
i
think
it
should
be
unaffected.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
standard
of
proof
will
affect
the
substantive
standard
i'm
arguing,
because
if
you
choose
a
high
–
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
now
as
a
matter
of
policy
i
think
it
is
appropriate
and
for
example,
if
you
look
at
the
states
that
have
looked
and
taken
a
prior
act
standard
like
wisconsin,
they've
used
as
a
matter
legislative
policy
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
there
is
more
margin
for
error,
but
it
depends
what
do
you
mean
by
“error”
mr.
chief
justice.
and
here
i
think
it's
very
different
from
the
criminal
process
and
i
think
we
have
to
get
away
from
that
kind
of
thinking
unless
we're
going
to
take
the
position
or
this
court's
going
to
rule
that
the
parens
patriae
power
of
the
state
is
nonexistent
and
that
all
state
efforts
in
hospitalizing
somebody
or
police
power
efforts
--
it
seems
to
me
what
the
difference
of
an
erroneous
commitment
is
that
in
a
criminal
area,
there's
a
lucky
guy.
the
guy
who
should
be
convicted
and
is
acquitted.
he
walks
away
and
he
has
got
a
real
windfall,
if
he
commits
another
crime,
the
state
suffers
the
burden,
the
laws.
in
civil
commitment
that's
not
the
case.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
correct,
but
in
civil
commitment
that's
not
the
case.
the
person
who
is
allowed
to
go
free
so
to
speak
--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
error.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
they're
far
different.
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes
they
are,
but
there
is
no
higher
standard
of
proof
than
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
even
in
this
six-month
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
he
goes
free,
if
the
criminal
walks
out,
he
gets
a
windfall
if
he
did
it,
whereas
if
the
patient
walks
out,
because
society
or
psychiatry
cannot
adduce
enough
evidence
to
satisfy
an
unduly
high
burden,
the
patient
is
not
helped,
we
do
no
favor
to
let
somebody
walk
out
of
an
arena
and
return
in
to
freedom
who
is
very,
very
ill.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
this
particular
gentleman
engaged
repeatedly
in
more
and
more
serious
behavior.
now,
i
assume
we
can
wait
as
a
society
until
somebody
commits
the
ultimate
act
to
proceed
under
the
criminal
law
or
we
can
try
and
intervene
–
mr.
joel
i.
klein
this
particular
gentleman,
that's
right,
that's
the
problem
with
the
process.
we
don't
want
to
reserve
civil
commitment
for
the
violent
people.
i
agree
that
if
you
if
you
turn
the
system
toward
the
violent--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
could
prove
the
fact
that
this
gentleman
engaged
in
past
threats
and
acts,
that
is
true,
they
could
not
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
seems
to
me,
that
his
mental
illness
was
so
severe
or
that
the
effects
of
not
treating
him
would
be
to
have
his
condition
deteriorate
and
his
violence
to
increase
in
the
future.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
absolutely
not
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
legislative
determination
which
legislatures
have
and
can
make,
but
that's
not
a
determination
that
this
court
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
should
make.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
it
depends
again
what
an
erroneous
commitment
is,
this
is
a
little
different
than
the
criminal
law.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
correct
and
it
does
seem
to
me
there
is
a
potential
for
that
erroneous
commitment
and
it
increases
as
you
lower
the
standard.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
certainly
disagree
with
the
issue
on
probabilities
about
mental
illness.
i
think
there
are
two
issues
that
is
there
were
numerous
specific
diagnoses
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
disagreement
about
that.
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
disagreement
about
severe
mental
illness
in
terms
of
psychosis.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
if
by
dangerous
you
mean
physical?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it's
very
hard
to
say,
your
honor,
it
could
be,
it
depends
on
each
individual
case.
long-term
dangerous
--
if
you
are
talking
about
in
the
next
five
to
ten
years,
very
low
reliability.
if
you
are
talking
about
in
the
short
term,
reasonably
high
reliability.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
if
in
fact
your
standard
is
dangerousness
in
a
sense
of
acting
physical
violence--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
those
are
people
who
maybe
very
ill
and
desperately
needed
help.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that
states
are
entitled
to
that
option,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
i
think
the
states
have
gone
the
gamut.
i
think
there
are
statutes
that
go
very
much
into
dangerousness
direction
and
i
think
they're
entitled
to
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
issue
should
be
left
for
the
fair
play
of
political
forces.
in
mckeever
where
the
court
did
not
constitutionalize
a
jury
trial,
it
didn't
say
a
jury
trial
was
a
bad
thing
in
juvenile
cases,
what
it
said
was
we're
not
ready
for
finality
on
that
issue
and
i
think
that's
the
same
thing
when
it
comes
to
burden
of
proof.
in
some
states,
the
apa
has
argued
in
the
state
legislatures
for
a
lower
burden
of
proof
and
for
broad
substantive
criteria,
frankly
we've
lost
in
some
states.
i
assume
no
what
matter
this
court
does
we
will
continue
to
lose
some
of
those
fights
but
i
think
society
is
entitled
to
that
diversity.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
not
long
term
commitment,
no
there
maybe
emergency
situations
your
honor,
but
not
long
terms
commitment,
absolutely
not.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
no
sir,
no
sir
we
don't
think
that
the
constitution
requires
a
jury
trial.
we
think
there
are
a
lot
of
serious
detriments
to
the
processes
if
we
do
so.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
approximately
half
have
in
place
a
statute
mr.
justice
stewart,
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that's
right
because
i
think
this
is
a
terribly
difficult
source.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
due
process
clause
is
--
court
realized
i
think
in
partterson
and
numerous
cases
is
well
satisfied
when
you
have
the
basics
of
due
process
and
texas
certainly
and
i
think
all
states
now
for
a
long
term
commitment.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
including
maryland
for
long
term.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
maryland
changed
in
'76
your
honor,
don't
hold
me
to
the
date
but
it
has
been
an
amendment
to
the
statute.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well
but
i
think
that's
a
different
problem
and
if
a
state
would
come
in
here
and
have
a
long
term
commitment
statute
with
no
due
process,
i
think
that
would
raise
another
issue.
fortunately,
i
think
that's
not
the
issue
that
we
have
here
today.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
claim
is
that
this
particular--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
with
this
particular
procedure
--
mr.
justice
marshall
was
saying
if
they
had
no
trial
whatsoever.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
understand
and
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
absolutely.
but
i
think
this
particular
procedure
is
not
mandated
by
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes.
i
would
just
close
in
urging
the
court
that
to
take
a
look
at
the
argument
in
the
brief
that
the
appellant
makes,
what
they
are
saying
is,
“don't
worry
about
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
can
do
it
because
we
can
show
past
dangerous
acts
and
that's
what
we'll
turn
civil
commitment
into
if
we
lock
in
a
high
standard
of
proof.”
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
will
become
past
dangerous
acts,
and
i'd
submit
behalf
of
my
client
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
americans
who
are
very
seriously
mentally
ill,
who
are
destroying
their
lives
and
their
families'
lives
but
who
have
not
acted
violent,
who
nevertheless
under
the
standard
set
down
in
o'connor
donaldson
case,
humphrey
versus
cady,
jackson
versus
indiana,
the
states
have
the
right
to
commit
in
their
role
as
parens
patriae
to
protect
its
citizen.
and
i'd
hope
that
this
court
not
take
an
isolated
procedure
and
undermine
the
states
power
in
that
regard.
thank
you
your
honor.
