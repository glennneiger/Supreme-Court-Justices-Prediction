ms.
martha
boston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
confined
in
austin
state
hospital
as
a
result
of
an
order
of
indefinite
commitment.
the
appellant
came
from
a
disturbed
family
and
in
december
of
1975
following
a
family
argument,
he
was
taken
to
jail
and
minor
criminal
charges
were
filed
against
him.
those
charges
were
subsequently
dismissed
and
in
their
place
the
state
instituted
indefinite
commitment
proceedings.
the
commitment
trial
lasted
for
five
days,
during
which
time
the
jury
heard
conflicting
testimony
as
to
the
need
to
commit
the
appellant.
the
appellant
urged
that
the
standard
of
proof
in
his
case
should
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
the
jury
was
instructed
to
make
its
finding
on
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence.
ms.
martha
boston
pardon
me.
ms.
martha
boston
he
is.
he
is
approximately
thirty
one.
ms.
martha
boston
the
record
isn't
clear
on
exactly
how
many
occasions.
there
have
been
several,
i
believe.
ms.
martha
boston
i
believe
it
was
something
like
eight
or
nine
within
the
last
five
years.
the
appellant
had
urged
that
"beyond
a
reasonable
doubt"
be
required
but
that
was
overruled
and
the
court
instructed
clear
and
convincing
evidence
or
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence.
the
jury
found
that
he
was
to
be
committed
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
and
the
appellant
filed
his
appeal
in
the
intermediate
state
appellate
court
on
the
basis
that
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required
by
the
due
process
clause.
that
court
agreed
with
the
appellant
and
reversed
the
order
of
commitment,
but
on
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court,
that
court
found
that
a
mere
preponderance
of
the
evidence
was
all
that
was
necessary
to
indefinitely
confine
a
person
in
a
mental
hospital.
that
court
therefore
reversed
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
affirmed
the
order
of
commitment
from
the
trial
court.
as
a
result
of
this
order
of
commitment,
the
appellant
has
been
confined
behind
the
locked
doors
of
boston
state
hospital
for
almost
three
years.
he
can't
leave
the
facility,
his
movements,
his
activities;
his
visitors
within
the
hospital
are
all
restricted
subject
to
supervision
by
the
staff.
he's
been
subjected
to
chemical
therapy
and
to
twenty-two
electroshock
treatments.
he
faces
very
real
possibility
that
he
may
never
leave
the
walls
of
austin
state
hospital.
ms.
martha
boston
the
substantive
standard
in
texas
is
two
issues.
the
first
is
that
the
person
is
mentally
ill
and
second,
that
the
person
requires
hospitalization
for
his
own
welfare
and
protection
or
for
the
protection
of
others.
it's
possible
under
the
statute;
it
is
actually
required
under
the
statute
to
reach
a
third
issue
regarding
mental
incompetency,
but
the
state
failed
to
plead
that,
so
it
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury.
ms.
martha
boston
there
was
a
psychiatric
testimony
on
the
state's
side.
on
the
appellant's
side,
there
was
a
social
worker
and
psychological
testimony
and
our
psychologist
was
stipulated
to
be
an
expert.
ms.
martha
boston
a
schizophrenic,
yes.
they
were
--
some
said
he
was
chronic
schizophrenic
and
then
there
was
-
that
was
said,
he
was
schizophrenic
paranoid
type,
paranoid
schizophrenic,
variations
of
schizophrenia,
yes
your
honor.
the
appellant
has
been
confined
for
three
years,
but
in
addition
to
the
confinement,
the
appellant
also
has
been
stigmatized
--
the
state
by
labeling
him
a
mentally
ill
person,
has
labeled
him
a
social
deviant.
and
if
he
ever
leaves
the
hospital,
he
will
be
a
former
mental
patient
and
the
studies
are
replete
with
evidence
that
this
is
a
form
of
social
deviancy
that
is
most
feared
and
rejected
in
our
society.
ms.
martha
boston
texas
has
a
requirement
that
each
patient
be
examined
at
least
every
six
months.
there
is
a
provision
whereby
he,
the
patient,
may
petition
for
reexamination.
he
is
limited
to
doing
that
the
first
time
a
year
from
his
commitment
and
then
after
that
he
can
only
do
it
every
two
years.
ms.
martha
boston
he
has
not.
ms.
martha
boston
there
had
been,
but
this
appeal
has
been
pending
all
at
that
time.
the
interests
that
are
at
stake
for
an
appellant
in
this
case
and
indeed
for
anyone
facing
an
indefinite
commitment
are
very
much
the
same
interests
that
were
at
stake
in
winship.
those
are
the
interests
of
the
juvenile
delinquent
or
a
criminal
defendant.
the
interests
are
that
of
the
total
loss
of
his
unconditional
liberty
and
the
freedom
from
being
stigmatized.
the
interests
were
found
by
this
court
in
that
case
to
be
of
such
transcending
value
that
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
would
be
required
of
the
state
before
those
interests
could
be
sacrificed,
that
argument
was
made
or
that
decision
rather
was
made
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
state's
motives
in
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings
were
benevolent
and
very
worthwhile
motives.
the
motives
in
fact
are
very
similar
here,
those
of
protecting
and
those
of
giving
treatment.
the
court's
reasoning
was
very
clear
in
winship
that
the
reason
for
requiring
the
higher
standard
of
proof
is
that
the
interest
for
the
individual
at
stake
are
so
great
that
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
confinement
cannot
be
any
higher
than
that.
the
texas
supreme
court
in
its
decision
totally
ignored
the
teaching
of
winship.
in
fact
it
relied
on
the
very
reasoning
that
was
rejected
in
winship,
that
is
that
the
benevolent
state
motivations
justify
a
lower
standard
of
proof.
as
i
said,
the
state's
motivations
are
almost
identical
and
there
seems
to
be
no
real
justification
for
using
a
lower
standard
of
proof
based
on
that
and
based
on
winship.
ms.
martha
boston
well,
your
honor
it's
my
position
that
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required.
i
recognized
that
there
is
a
very
real
possibility
that
this
court
would
consider
clear
and
convincing
as
any
other
mediate
ground
and
in
deed
that
was
the
instruction–-
ms.
martha
boston
well,
there
is
a
number
of
states
that
use
clear
and
convincing
and
that
has
been
argued
in
the
briefs
on
the
other
side,
well
the
amici
briefs
have
suggested
clear
and
convincing
might
be
an
alternative.
ms.
martha
boston
i
think
you
are
right
although
of
course
this
court
has
recognized
clear
and
convincing
is
a
standard
in
some
cases,
deportation
for
instance.
but
the
“beyond
a
reasonable
doubt”
standard
as
it
comes
down
through
the
common
law
and
as
it
was
stated
in
winship,
the
purposes
of
using
that
standard
are
to
reduce
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
confinement
and
that's
exactly
what's
at
stake
here,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
this
is
labeled
as
winship,
and
we
found
labeled
a
civil
proceeding.
ms.
martha
boston
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
--
well,
first
of
all
the
jury's
function
of
course
is
to
weigh
the
believability
of
each
of
those
three
or
six
equivalent
psychiatrists.
ms.
martha
boston
that's
right.
ms.
martha
boston
that's
right
but
very
much
the
same
thing
is
its
state
but
additionally
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
has
to
rely
solely
on
psychiatric
testimony
in
a
vacuum.
i
think
psychiatric
testimony
or
psychiatric
assessments
are
based
upon
observations,
history,
they
are
based
upon
facts.
it's
an
opinion
drawn
from
facts.
and
there's
enough--
ms.
martha
boston
well
i
would
suggest
that
the
state
bring
in
witnesses
perhaps
eye
witnesses
to
acts
of
dangerous
conduct
or
continuing
history
of
self
neglect.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
buttress
the
psychiatrists'
opinion
by
bringing
in
the
evidence
that
the
psychiatrist
is
basing
his
opinion
on.
ms.
martha
boston
well
that
is
an
expert--
ms.
martha
boston
that's
true,
but
being
a
schizophrenic
person
alone
is
not
sufficient
under
the
standard
to
lock
a
person
in
a
mental
hospital.
ms.
martha
boston
yes
it's
for--
requires
hospitalization
for
his
own
welfare
and
protection
or
the
protection
of
others.
ms.
martha
boston
well
it's
really
hard
to
distinguish
what's
predictive,
what's
historical,
what's
factual,
it's
all
very
much
tied
in
together
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
assessment
comes
from
a
factual
basis.
ms.
martha
boston
yes,
it
did.
ms.
martha
boston
that's
right;
there
were
also
factual
witnesses
there.
and
this
court
recognized
in
minnesota
ex
rel.
pearson,
which
was
a
sex
offender
statute
i
believe
that,
which
is
not
exactly
in
point,
but
the
language
of
the
court
recognized
the
ability
of
a
jury
or
fact
finder
to
look
at
acts
of
past
conduct
as
pointing
to
probabilities
of
future
conduct.
ms.
martha
boston
well
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
the
area
where
we
will
allow
the
states
their
flexibility
in
drafting
within
of
course
guidelines
of
broadness
and
vagueness,
allow
the
states
the
flexibility
of
creating,
writing
out
their
substantive
criteria.
ms.
martha
boston
certainly
that's
true,
but
the
wise,
it
seems
to
me
is
in
the
basic
question
of
how
much
proof
regardless
of
what
we're
proving,
how
much
proof
we
are
going
to
have,
and
that's
what
was
addressed
in
winship.
ms.
martha
boston
well
they
are
connected
but
i
don't
think--
ms.
martha
boston
well
your
honor
it
is
connected
but
in
the
same
sense
in
the
criminal
context
we
don't
vary
the
quantum
of
proof
based
on
the
elements
of
the
offense.
ms.
martha
boston
generally--
ms.
martha
boston
certainly,
but
again
the
predictive
nature
of
these
hearings
of
this
evidence
as
it
has
been
cast
is
not
solely
predictive
it's--
there's
very
much
factual
evidence
there
and
as
i
said
the
psychiatrists'
assessments
are
based
on
factual
evidence.
ms.
martha
boston
that's
true.
but
the
fact
finder
does
not
have
to
rely
on
that
in
a
vacuum
if
the
state
or
the
respondent
brings
forward
other
factual
evidence.
and
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
the
most
responsible
way
to
conduct
a
commitment
hearing
for
the
state
would
be
to
rely
not
just
on
psychiatric
testimony
but
to
bring
in
as
much
evidence
but
as
much--
ms.
martha
boston
well
i
think
–
ms.
martha
boston
well
i
think
those
are
two
separate
questions,
i
think--
ms.
martha
boston
are
you
asking
me
if
“beyond
a
reasonable
doubt”
could
be
met?
ms.
martha
boston
that's
right
but
that's
goes
to
the
question,
the
substantive
standards
aren't
in
question
here
the
only
issue
–
ms.
martha
boston
i
understand.
ms.
martha
boston
i'm
not
aware
of
there
being
any
states
that
don't
require
other
criteria.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
states
that
will
allow
commitment
based
just
upon
mental
illness,
to
mental
illness
plus
something
and
it
maybe
cast
in
terms
of
welfare
and
protection
as
texas
is.
some
other
states
cast
them
in
very
distinct,
very
orderly
requirements
but
whatever
the
state
is
requiring
to
be
proved--
ms.
martha
boston
yes.
ms.
martha
boston
i
believe
it
is,
i
am
not
a
criminal
law
practitioner
and
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
statutes
all
across
the
line.
ms.
martha
boston
well
the
question
of
the
insanity
defense,
it
seems
to
me
as
if
the
state,
my
understanding
of
leland
versus
oregon
is
that
the
state
can
require
proof
of
the
insanity
defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
therefore
there
is
the
imbalance
that
might--
ms.
martha
boston
do
i
believe
the
state
can
commit
without
a
trail?
ms.
martha
boston
no
i
do
not;
i
believe
that
would
be
a
clear
violation.
ms.
martha
boston
that
commit
without
a
trial?
ms.
martha
boston
well-
ms.
martha
boston
in
texas
for
instance
that--
there
does
have
to
be
that--
there
but
the
hearing
is
required
unless
you
are
talking
about
commitment
pending
adjudication.
ms.
martha
boston
well
i
think
if
the
state
is
going
to
commit
somebody
without
a
hearing
just
on
the
basis
of
that,
i
think
that's
a
clear
violation
of
defense.
ms.
martha
boston
that's
true,
but
that's
a
very
different
analysis.
this
court
has
considered
the
issue
of
a
jury
trial
or
right
to
counsel
separately
through
the
situations
in
which
it's
considered
the
standard
of
proof.
ms.
martha
boston
accepting
the
notion
that
that
is,
yes
i
mean--
ms.
martha
boston
well
all
the
state
has
to
do
is
change
the
last
criteria.
ms.
martha
boston
that's
right.
but
i
think
any
element
that
is
going
to
result
in
total
confinement;
the
total
deprivation
of
liberty
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
have
reserved
10
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
would
be
glad
to
answer.
ms.
martha
boston
thank
you.
ms.
martha
boston
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
klein's
statement
about
his
parens
patriae
commitments.
he
seems
to
presuppose
the
very
thing
that
we're
there
to
decide
that
is
or
an
element
of
what
we're
there
to
decide,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
this
person
is
mentally
ill.
mr.
klein
seems
to
assume
that
he
is
and
that's
why
he
is
not
seeking
hospitalization
on
his
own.
if
that's
the
case
then
there
is
no
need
for
a
hearing,
but
indeed
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
and
that's
what
we're
there
to
decide.
ms.
martha
boston
i
believe
he
said
both
your
honor
in
relation
to
that
latter
statement.
i
think
my
statements
earlier
about
proving
a
past
act
don't
go
just
proving
a
past
act
of
violence.
a
person
who
is
severely,
mentally
ill
to
the
extent
that
he
is
self
neglectful--
surely
there
is
family
members
or
neighbors
who've
seen
this
sort
of
conduct
and
can
testify
to
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
not
that
difficult
to
establish.
ms.
martha
boston
no
i
am
not;
i
am
saying
that
that
is
way
of
buttressing
psychiatric
testimony
so
that
you
don't
have
to
rely
just
on
the
inaccuracies.
ms.
martha
boston
i
don't
believe
it
would
become
mandatory.
i
think
psychiatry,
well
i
think
predictions
are
relied
on
in
several
contexts,
and
i
can
point
to
two
specific
legislative
similar
situations
in
texas
where
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required
for
predicting,
if
you
will,
future
conduct.
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
punishment
phase
of
a
capital
felony
trial
in
which
the
jury
is
required
to
answer
yes
or
no
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
probability
that
the
defendant
will
engage
in
criminal
violence
so
as
to
constitute
a
continuing
threat
to
society.
ms.
martha
boston
no
he
doesn't.
but
i
would
bring
that
up
not
to
say
that
because
it's
required
in
that
situation,
it
should
be
required
here.
but
to
show
that
the
legislature
recognized
in
that
situation
that
it's
possible
and
that's
virtually
the
same
thing
that
we
are
trying
to
prove
here.
and
additionally,
the
mentally
retarded
person's
act
in
texas
which
was
passed
since
the
time
that
this
suit
began
requires
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
martha
boston
not
that
i'm
aware
of
although
we
have
truly
--
ms.
martha
boston
i
don't
think
its
as
insidious
as
doing
in.
i
think
what
it
reflects
is
the
severe
lack
of
understanding
about
and
knowledge
about
mental
illness
in
our
society
and
this
goes
to
the
question,
stigmatized,
people
don't
understand
mental
illness
and
consequently.
ms.
martha
boston
certainly
and
mr.
klein's,
the
american
psychiatrics
association's
brief
is
full
of
references,
as
its
appellant,
to
the
kinds
of
problems
that
people
face;
that
mental
patients
and
former
mental
patients
are
feared
and
loafed
in
our
society
because
people
don't
understand
and
its
in
the
first
place
it
sort
of
ease
--
ms.
martha
boston
well,
what
it's
going
to
do
is
keep
those
people
who
are
not
proper
subjects
of
commitment
from
being
committed,
therefore
stigmatized,
being
deprived
of
their
liberty.
and
certainly
we're
not
trying
to
just
setup
a
hurdle
to
make
psychiatrist
in
the
state
jump
over
for
no
reason.
we
want
to
increase
the
sureness
of
those
assessments
that
result
in
commitment,
we
want
to
reduce
the
number
of
people
who
are
erroneously
locked
in
mental
hospitals.
ms.
martha
boston
well,
of
course
the
society
in
which
he
was
living
was
very
aware
of
all
of
that
and
clearly
he
has
been
stigmatized
to
begin
with.
but
the
more--
well
there's
one
study
in
our
brief
i
believe
it's
on
page
24
that
says
if
the
level
of
stigma
increases
with
the
level
of
state
intervention.
so
that
the
more
one
is
committed,
the
longer
one
is
committed
for,
the
greater
the
stigma.
and
certainly
that
can
be
seen
clearly
in
employment
applications
if
you
have
to
try
to
explain
a
way
of
three
year
gap
in
your
employment
history
you
can
have
a
big
problem.
ms.
martha
boston
the
exact
--
because
of
the
retardation
the
person
represents
a
substantial
risk
of
physical
impairment
or
injury
to
himself
or
others
or
is
unable
to
provide
for
and
is
not
providing
for
his
most
basic
physical
needs.
ms.
martha
boston
that's
right.
ms.
martha
boston
mental
retardation
is
just
about
the
only
difference.
but
the
state
of
texas
passed
this
statute
only
in
it's
last
legislative
session,
which
i
believe
was
'77
and
this
proceeding
was
instituted--
ms.
martha
boston
they
are
entitled
to
a
jury.
ms.
martha
boston
i
think
there's
probably
some
very
different
considerations
that
go
into
them,
but
this
proceeding
of
commitment
to
mental
retardation
facility
is
very
similar
in
what
it
seeks
to
do.
and
i'm
not
presenting
any
protection
claim
at
all,
but
just
saying
that
that's
another
area
in
which
it's
been
recognized
that
that
sort
of
thing
could
be.
ms.
martha
boston
well,
it's
in
the
same
way
that
we're
talking
about
prediction
before
it's--
it's
prediction
based
on
retardation
and
acts
and
so
on.
ms.
martha
boston
mental
retardation,
in
the
same
way
that
the
mental
health
code
requires
a
determination
of
mental
illness.
okay,
in
terms
of
the
necessity
of
psychiatrist
being
very
sure
about
their
predictions,
their
assessments,
again
i
would
just
like
to
stress
that
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
stevens'
broadly
accepted
it,
is
the
inaccuracy
of
those
assessments
that's
so
concerning
in
this
situation.
and
if
we
believe
the
statistics
that
are
in
the
brief
for
amicus
national
center
for
law
and
the
handicapped,
the
incidence
of
error
due
to
over
prediction
and
over
diagnose--
over
prediction
of
dangerous
and
over
diagnosis
of
mental
illness
is
--
the
error
is
going
to
occur
in
more
in
committing
someone
erroneously
than
in
failing
to
commit
someone
erroneously
and
that's
what
the
concern
is.
ms.
martha
boston
i've
never
heard
of
psychiatrist
say
that.
ms.
martha
boston
medical--
reasonable
medical
certainty,
but
the
question
of
burden
of
proof
doesn't.
ms.
martha
boston
well,
the
jury
doesn't--
i
don't
believe
the
jury
has
to
apply
that
standard
to
each
witness.
we
don't
qualify
the
witnesses
on
how
sure
they
are
of
the
testimony
they
are
about
to
give.
the
jury
takes
the
whole
picture
and
that's
why
i
keep
stressing
the
other
things
that
can
be
brought
in.
the
jury
takes
the
whole
picture
--
ms.
martha
boston
certainly.
ms.
martha
boston
certainly
my
point
is
that
the
creditability
factor
goes
into
the
jury
agreement,
it
doesn't
happen
when
we
bring
--
we
don't
require
a
psychiatrist
to
be
sure
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
obviously.
he
can
take
--
the
jury
takes
it
all
into
the
jury
room
with
them.
ms.
martha
boston
thank
you.
