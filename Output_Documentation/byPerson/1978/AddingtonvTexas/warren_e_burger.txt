chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
addington
against
texas.
ms.
boston
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
appellant
is
an
adult,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
an
adult,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
been
in
mental
institutions
on
how
many
occasions
before
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
in
the
record
it
suggested
that
he
has
been
in
ten
times
in
the
last
five
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
go
back
to
the
standard,
what
was
required
to
be
proved
to
bring
about
a
commitment
in
the
jury
trial
that
you
say
lasted
five
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
was
psychiatric
testimony
on
both
sides.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
psychiatric
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
he
was
schizophrenic,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
jury--
did
this
jury
hear
from
some
witnesses
that
there
had
been
ten
episodes
which
previously
led
to
his
confinement
in
mental
institutions
over
a
period
of
five
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
that
would
be
a
basis
on
which
they
could
draw
some
influences
about
the
future?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
not
some
states
where
the
statute
provides
precisely
what
mr.
justice
stewart
has
just
outlined
that
a
commitment
involuntarily
maybe
made
on
the
testimony
of
two
physicians?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
not
some
jurisdictions
which
provide
that
after
the
return
of
the
verdict
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
that
commitment
to
a
mental
institution
maybe
had
simply
on
a
preponderance
of
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
federal
statutes
and
at
least
in
the
district
of
columbia
code
and
in
many
states,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
don't
you
think
that's
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
ms.
boston.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
tell
us
a
little
bit
at
some
point
about
the
review
procedures,
the
periodic
reviews,
do
that
at
your
own
convenience.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
fundamentally
very
much
different
from
the
kind
of
predictive
analysis
which
a
parole
board
makes
when
it
considers
whether
it
should
release
a
convicted
prisoner
half
way
or
one-third
the
way
through
his
commitment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
the
reporting
requirements,
but
they
can't
monitor
a
parolee
24
hours
a
day
or
even
once
a
day.
they
report
perhaps
once
a
week
or
perhaps
once
a
month
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
background
of
the
person,
but
the
predictive
element
is
quite
similar,
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
a
parole
board
in
releasing
a
prisoner
is
making
a
decision
that
on
balance
is
more
unlikely
not
to
engage
in
anti-social
conduct
thanâ€”that
he
will
do
so.
that
is
the
decision
isn't
it?
now
frequently
they
are
wrong
of
course,
we
know
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here
of
course
the
trial
judge
gave
a
much
stronger
instruction
and
gave
the
one
that
mr.
justice
white
alluded
to
as
being
required
in
some
states
is,
if
you
know
is
that
the
general
practice
of
trial
judges
in
these
hearings
or
do
they
stage
the
traditional
preponderance
test
of
civil
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
says
they
don't
need
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
we
set
a
standard
ordinarily
in
the
law
because
of
the
potential
of
being
able
to
meet
the
high
standard
that
is
simply
because
texas
could
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
as
they
might,
well
they've
been
able
to
do
here.
is
that
a
constitutional
reason
for
requiring
that
standard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
anything
further
ms.
boston?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
emphasizing
understandably
so
the
parallelism
to
criminal
system
but
then
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
we
have
in
the
country
thousands,
literally
thousands
of
law
enforcement
officers
who
are
roaming,
looking
for
criminal
conduct
and
then
arresting
people
and
probably
thousands
with
fewer
prosecutors
who
are
constantly
alluded
to
in
charged
with
the
duty
of
prosecuting.
we
don't
have
any
such
mechanism
setup
to
look
around
for
mentally
ill
people,
do
we,
in
the
society.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
police
may
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
hospitals
incidentally
but
there
is
no
comparable
structure.
i
get
reading,
some
of
these
briefs,
an
impression
that
there
is
some
attitude,
there
are
some
elements
of
society
to
try
to
do
in
mentally
ill
people,
and
lock
them
up
and
keep
them
there.
of
course
we
know
that
it
costs
vastly
more
to
keep
people
in
mental
institutions
than
it
does
in
prisons.
is
there
any
basis
for
thinking
that
government
in
one
way
or
another
or
others
not
in
governments
are
trying
to
commit
a
lot
of
people
unnecessarily?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
see
even
the
psychiatrists
admit
that
they
don't
understand
it
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
the
burden,
how
is
the
change
to
the
maximum
burden
of
proof,
the
criminal
burden
of
proof
trying
to
help
that
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
texas
or
any
state
is
constitutionally
required
to
have
the
same
standard
for
retardation
as
they
do
for
commitments
of
--
or
schizophrenia?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
jury
can
reject
any
particular
witness
or
an
individual
jury
can
on
the
grounds
that
he
doesn't
believe
him
or
it
doesn't
think
he
is
very
reliable
or
very
sound.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
credibility
factor,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
