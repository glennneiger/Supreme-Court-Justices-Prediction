mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
william
orr
has
been
required
to
pay
alimony
to
his
former
wife
under
alabama
statutes,
which
require
payment
of
alimony
by
husbands
only.
and
so
the
question
before
you
today
is
whether
or
not
these
statutes
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
our
united
states
constitution.
this
court's
precedent
establishes
that
laws
classifying
on
the
basis
of
sex
are
unconstitutional
when
rooted
in
the
role-typing,
one
should
routinely
imposed
on
women
and
men.
two;
when
that
notion
that
women
are
men's
subordinates
and
three,
over
broad
gross
ranking
of
men
as
dominant
and
independent,
women
as
weak,
inferior
and
dependent.
as
appellee
puts
it,
the
law
derives
from
a
view
of
the
married
woman
as
a
non-entity,
a
view
maintained
for
centuries
but
now
recognized
as
archaic,
outmoded,
and
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
equal
status
and
dignity
of
all
persons
under
our
law.
alabama's
scheme
rooted
as
it
is
in
historic
role-typing
cannot
be
justified
as
remedial.
any
attempt
to
address
the
classification
in
a
compensatory
cloak
is
inevitably
deceivable.
mr.
john
l.
capell,

kahn
v.
shevin,
sir
is
a
-
-
i
am
going
to
in
a
moment.
in
kahn
v.
shevin,
they
said
was,
your
court
came
out
and
said
that
it
was
alright
in
that
instance
because
we
were
dealing
with
a
tax
situation
and
as
pointed
out
in
that
case,
the
states
are
given
great
leeway
in
kahn
v.
shevin.
however
under
the
alabama
statute,
your
honor,
the
situation
is
on
a
case-by-case
method.
read
in
context
with
alabama's
alimony
statute
is
common
law
origin,
the
alabama
law
was
hardly
designed
with
economic
preference
for
women
in
mind
as
was
kahn.
on
the
contrary
as
the
appellee's
brief
pointed
out,
the
common
law
subordinated
the
wife
to
the
husband.
it
declared
the
wife
disabled,
stripped
of
her
capacity
to
sustain
herself.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
it
was
designed
to
prefer
women
sir
because
there
is
no
statute
which
prefers
men
at
all.
men
have
to
pay
alimony
for
one
reason
because
alabama's
statute
says
it
does.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
based
on
an
alabama's
statute.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
that
is
true
if
the
statute
would
have
held
to
be
constitutional
without
the
statute,
so
alimony
could
not
even
be
questioned
in
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
he
would
have
had
there
been
a
statute.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
no
sir
he
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
he
was
not
allowed
to
your
honor
at
that
time
because
the
statute
did
not
allow
him
to
even
request
alimony.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
he
didn't.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
the
appellate
courts
of
alabama
said
if
the
appeal
was
timely
filed
when
we
questioned
the
judgments
that
were
being
--
trying
to
be
obtained
by
the
appellee
wife
against
mr.
orr.
at
that
point
in
time,
he
questioned
whether
or
not
this
would
be
a
valid
judgment
based
because
of
the
constitutional
issue
which
we
are
presenting
before
you
today.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
that's
right
sir,
that
is
â€“
it's
only
gender
line
strictly
on
sex
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
that
is
correct,
the
lower
court
ordered
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
alright
your
honor,
let
me
see
if
i
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
well,
let's
look
at
it
this
way
your
honor.
when
a
man
comes
into
a
court
in
alabama
in
a
divorce
suit,
the
statue
of
justice
is
speaking
at
that
point
in
time
your
honor
to
determine
what
sex
he
is
and
they
are
tilted
with
the
point
in
time
when
that
man
walks
into
court.
consequently
his
ability
to
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
and
consequently
also
your
honor
the
scales
are
tilted
in
favor
of
the
woman
immediately.
he
is
bargaining
power
is
suddenly
gone
from
the
very
point
he
walks
in.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
my
client
was
deprived
because
of
the
alimony
statute,
was
suffering
financial
burden
based
solely
on
the
unconstitutional
statute
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
he
did
so
in
a
subsequent
hearing
your
honor,
which
is
attached
and
made
a
part
of
the
appendix
of
the
record.
he
raised
it
when
she
tried
to
come
in
and
say,
you
have
to
pay
me
these
many
dollars
and
he
said
that
judgment
would
be
illegal
because
it
was
being
based
on
a
statute
which
is
unconstitutional.
had
he
had
been
in
an
alimony
statute
in
alabama,
which
was
sex-neutral,
where
mr.
orr
could
have
come
in
and
say,
i
want
alimony,
he
would
have
done
so.
yes
justice
marchall?
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
would
you
repeat
the
first
part
of
that,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
he
could
file
what
was
called
a
petition
to
modify
your
honor
in
alabama
based
on
the
change
of
the
law
if
this
court
held
the
alabama
statute
unconstitutional,
but
this
would
be
hailed
again
your
honor
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
he
litigated
it
your
honor
in
the
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
in
the
court
of
lee
county,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
not
exactly
your
honor.
it
was
raised
at
this
proceeding.
it
was
raised
in
a
contempt
preceding
this
issue
all
of
the
alabama
alimony
statute
and
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
at
that
particular
point
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
my
client,
he
signed
an
agreement
which
the
court
of
alabama
says
by
its
law
sir,
that
it
goes
into
be
sure
that
the
woman,
not
the
man
but
that
the
woman
is
protected
to
sustain
the
case
in
alabama.
mr.
orr
had
he
had
the
opportunity
though
of
a
sex-neutral
statute
your
honor
at
that
time
he
walked
into
court,
when
he
walked
in
the
first
time,
it
is
our
position
he
would
not
have
signed
an
agreement,
but
he
did
sign
it
because
he
is
more
vulnerable
because
of
his
sex.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
it
was
raised
in
the
first
time
that
my
representation
of
mr.
orr
your
honor,
which
was
at
a
contempt
proceeding
before
the
circuit
court.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
because
of
the
wordings
of
our
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
but
it
is
an
agreement
that
is
incorporated
into
a
final
decree
which
is
looked
at
by
the
court
and
the
lower
court
at
that
point
in
time
looks
to
see
what
alabama
pay
should
require
that
the
woman
is
protected,
nothing
mentioned
about
the
man.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
in
divorce
proceedings
your
honor,
in
alabama
there
are
three
parties
to
every
agreement.
there
is
the
man,
there
is
the
woman
and
there
is
the
state
of
alabama.
the
state
of
alabama
as
the
cases
have
pointed
out,
is
a
silent
party
looking
to
see
what,
that
the
women
are
protected;
this
case
was
cited.
this
is
what
mr.
orr
is
contending
that
had
he
come
in,
had
he
been
allowed
to
come
in
on
a
sex-neutral
basis
and
he
is
ready
willing
and
able
to
go
back
and
to
fight
on
a
basis
of
sex-neutral
battle
which
would
be
up
to
the
court
of
alabama
to
hear.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
that's
the
court
of
civil
appeals
did
your
honor.
they
did
say
that
this
issue
that
we
were
just
discussing,
while
it's
timely
filed.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
if
you
are
following
that
statement
of
that
being
quashed,
if
you
look
at
justice
almon's
statement,
which
is
a
concurring
opinion
with
the
majority,
you
will
see
that
it
states
and
i
am
quoting
in
essence
that
any
statute
which
favors
women
against
men
is
constitutional.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
i
would
like
to
respectfully
state
that
opinion
would
not
be
the
reason
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
maintain
before
this
court
that
mr.
orr
does
have
a
standing
based
on
the
facts
of
the
alabama
statutes
as
we
have
specified.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir
and
i
have
no
answer
for
you
to
that
question
your
honor.
read
in
context
with
this
common
law
origin,
the
alabama
law
was
hardly
designed
with
economic
preference
for
women
and
men.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
in
my
opinion
in
this
instant
that
issue,
that
answer
is
correct
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
that
is
correct
sir
and
i
do
not
have
a
--
i
would
be
happy
to
brief
that
point
and
submit
a
subsequent
brief
to
you
on
that
point
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
it
meant
that
the
finding
of
the
alimony
statute
of
a
constitutional
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
are
affirming
the
statute
of
alabama
concerning
to
alimony
statute
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
well,
quashing
means
dismissing.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
right,
quashing
does
mean
to
dismiss
in
my
opinion,
however
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
but
however,
justice
almon
said
and
he
had
a
concurring
that
he
does
affirm,
he
would
affirm
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
and
i
do
not
know
your
honor
if
that's
slightly
opined
or
what
of
that
issue.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
your
honor.
getting
back
to
the
question
that
was
asked
i
was
though,
when
read
in
context
with
this
common
law,
alabama
law
was
hardly
designated
with
economic
preference
for
women.
on
the
contrary,
as
the
appellee's
brief
points
out,
this
common
law
subordinated
women
to
husbands;
declared
wives
disable
and
stripped
over
capacity
to
sustain
herself.
in
essence,
appellee's
argument
that
the
very
legal
regime
discriminates
against
a
woman
can
be
salvaged
if
that
regime
throws
the
woman
a
bone
after
placing
her
in
the
cage
and
this
argument
could
not
withstand
actual
reflection
and
reason
analysis.
you
asked
me
about
kahn;
support
for
one-way
alimony
statutes,
there
is
a
scheme
now
maintained
by
rapidly
dwindling
number
of
states.
now,
this
court's
decision
in
kahn
v.
shevin
can
be
distinguished,
subsequent
decisions
wiesenfeld
and
goldfarb,
make
it
apparent
that
kahn
will
not
bear
the
weight
that
the
appellee
would
place
upon
it.
as
we
know
kahn
upheld
a
property
tax
exemption
worth
$15
annually,
granted
to
voters
but
not
to
where
it
was.
a
key
factor
in
kahn
was
the
other
impracticability
of
awarding
the
$15
dispensation
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
in
the
show
of
contrast
an
alimony
in
alabama
has
never
awarded
categorically.
the
individual
case,
one's
ability
to
pay,
the
length
of
the
marriage,
the
other
person's
need,
all
these
and
other
factors,
determine
how
much
should
be
paid
and
for
how
longer
period
of
time.
but
given
that
fact
that
alabama
has
chosen
to
make
alimony
awards
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
there
is
no
necessity
whatsoever
for
classification
by
sex.
tax
classification,
because
of
the
impracticability
of
individualized
adjudications
is
an
area
in
which
states
have
large
leeway,
but
there
is
no
warrant
for
such
leeway
in
an
area
such
as
the
one
at
bar
where
adjudication
must
be
made
again
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
thus
the
administrative
convenience,
the
prime
consideration
in
kahn
is
not
tenable
argument
to
our
case
before
us.
sparing
the
public
purse
is
not
a
consideration
here
as
it
was
in
kahn.
and
in
addition,
the
$15
favoring
kahn
was
no
slide.
it
was
so
slided,
it
could
not
be
expected
to
affect
the
behavior
of
men
and
women.
however,
a
one
way
alimony
statute
is
the
large
and
capricious
reminder
in
reinforcement
of
society's
traditional
type
casting.
yes,
justice
marshal.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
alright
sir.
you
look
at
the
court
appendix
say
--
look
at
page
number
10-a
if
you
will
your
honor,
on
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
that
is
it
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
putting
kahn
in
perspective
with
wiesenfeld
and
goldfarb
clarify
that
the
court
follows
no
knee-jerk
rule.
women
litigants
win,
and
men,
males
lose.
as
we
know
both
in
wiesenfeld
and
goldfarb,
men
were
the
complainers.
men
in
both
cases,
as
in
the
instant
case,
gender
type
casting
frozen
in
legislation
was
the
target,
which
was
successfully
attacked.
in
califano
v.
webster,
this
court
carefully
distinguished
historic
knee-jerk,
gender-based
categorization
no
modern
law
passed
in
direct
response
to
a
wage
in
job
placement,
bias
against
women.
the
webster
per
curiam
makes
it
clear
that
the
court
will
uphold
a
gender
classification,
alleged
to
be
it
compensatory
only
if
the
law
in
fact
was
enacted
to
check
adverse
discrimination
women
encounter
and
not
out
of
prejudice
about
women's
weakness,
inferiority,
and
dependency.
further
such
genuine
compensation
clarifications
must
match
that
remedial
end.
therefore
the
differential
at
bar
surely
does
not
fit
the
webster,
it
rests
on
the
traditional
way
of
thinking
about
females.
it
plainly
was
not
enacted
to
remedy
or
to
reduce
hostility
to
women
in
the
labor
market.
in
summation,
the
gender
classification
at
issue
is
a
means
to
allocate
maintenance,
responsibility
post-divorce
is
patently
unfair
and
does
not
relate
substantially
to
the
state
objective.
functional
sex-neutral
classification
is
the
fair
means
readily
available
to
request
rights
and
obligations
between
spouses,
because
one
way
alimony
is
a
historical
hangover
that
discriminates
against
men
and
stigmatizes
women,
the
decision
below
cannot
survive
reason
review
and
consequently
we
respectfully
request
that
the
alabama
alimony
statute
beheld
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
justice.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes,
its
own
economics
and
i
think
we
have
to
differentiate
sir
again
between
khan
with
goldfarb
and
wiesenfeld.
goldfarb
and
wiesenfeld,
the
men
did
attack
this
statute
that
favored
women
and
were
successful
before
this
court.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
well,
i
view
them
as
the
discrimination
against
men.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no,
if
you
cast
the
case
of
orr
in
a
standpoint
of
economic
considerations
only
where
you
have
a
gender
type
role
casting.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
so
my
answer
would
be
determination
of
how
you
look
at
goldfarb
and
how
you
look
at
wiesenfeld.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
yes
sir,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
it
goes
back
to
alabama
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
alabama
will
look
at
this
case
on
a
sex-neutral
basis,
looking
at
need
not
sex,
looking
at
the
ability
to
pay;
looking
at
understanding
of
where
both
men
and
women
come
into
court
on
an
equal
basis,
where
there
is
no
tilt,
where
there
is
no
favoritism
because
of
sex
and
that
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
two
things
would
happen
very
quickly
your
honor.
again
it's
up
to
the
alabama
and
not
this
court
it's
my
feeling,
but
alabama
under
the
common
law
of
doctrine
that
was
in
existence
prior
to
the
statute
could
take
effect,
but
they
would
have
to
look
at
it
with
your
order
and
mine,
that
is
sex-neutral,
equality
under
the
law
regardless
of
sex.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
depending
on
what
we
call
losing
and
what
we
call
winning
your
honor
because
i
feel
that
when
mr.
orr
came
into
the
lower
court,
he
came
in
with
not
a
chance
to
bargain,
to
place
himself
on
an
equal
footing
when
this
is
over.
we
ask
for
that
right.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
quietly
the
contrary
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
and
yet
in
many,
many
cases,
there
are.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
whether
he
was
entitled
to
it
or
not,
we
wanted
the
right
to
ask
your
honor
so
that
we
could
go
in
and
quote
for
the
right
to
obtain.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
that's
correct
sir.
but
it
is
not
based
on
â€“
it
was
based
on
the
need
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
and
there
are
many
men
that
who
fit
under
that
category
who
should
be
receiving
and
who
are
not
sir,
because
of
their
sex.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
my
client
would
have
asked
and
as
a
result
of
asking
in
my
opinion.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
because
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
right
because
he
weren't
allowed
to
by
alabama
law
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
i
did
not
do
that
because
of
the
fact
that
is
the
matter
that
the
state
should
take
up
again
on
a
sex-neutral
basis
your
honor,
not
on
the
basis
of
whether
mr.
orr
is
a
man?
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
we
did
not.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
it
was
wholly
permissible
in
alabama
for
us
to
raise
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yeah,
based
on
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
relying
on
this
state
statute.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
not
in
every
case.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
but
it
does,
but
it
strictly
related
to
man
thing
not
women
paying
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
it
wherein
the
state
is
the
third
party.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
that's
why
and
under
the
state
statute
mr.
chief
justice,
they
being
the
third-party
involved
in
each
divorce
suit,
don't
look
to
the
fairness
of
the
award
as
they
should
which
is
our
contention.
they
look
to
see
if
the
wife
is
protected;
i
am
relying
on
the
standard
case
which
is
applied
to
the
attached
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
you
are
right
your
honor
and
but
in
addition
to
that
mr.
orr
as
the
alabama
appellate
court
stated
timely
filed
his
objection
to
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
at
the
time
he
raised
the
issue
or
when
she
brought
him
into
court
in
alabama
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
there
would
be
no
hearing
on
that
your
honor
because
the
courts
are
not
allowed
to
even
decide
that
or
to
sit
on
it,
they
have
even
reversed
a
lower
court
which
allowed
a
man
to
stay
in
the
home
which
state
in
joint
tenancy.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
because
of
the
fact
that
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
probably,
no
alimony
of
any
form
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
i
would
say
your
honor
respectfully
request
to
say
to
you
that
probably
25%
of
all
alabama
cases
there
is
not
some
form
of
alimony,
be
it
alimony
in
gross.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir,
looking
at
the
ability
of
the
man
to
pay.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir.
this
issue
was
not
raised
at
the
lower
court
proceeding,
the
record
is
moved
on
that
point.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
they
would
have
been
saying
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
would
i
be
here,
yes
sir,
i
would
be
here
for
the
sole
purpose
--
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
as
in
dale
v.
dale,
in
the
maine
case,
the
situation
is
such
that
mr.
orr
standing
to
come
into
court
at
initial
time
to
ask
for
fairness
and
equality
under
the
law
the
guarantees
the
fourteenth
amendment.
these
were
not
allowed
to
him
but
in
addition.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
only
upon
where
the
judge
abuses
his
discretion.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
has
he
ever
won?
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
sure,
on
the
discretionary
abuse
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
we
established
it
strictly
on
the
constitutional
basis,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
because
alabama
takes
each
case
sir
on
a
case-by-case.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
they
would
be,
they
would
give
rise
to
the
case
being
brought
back
before
if
the
man
wanted
to
make
the
claim
saying
that
this
alimony
based
in
max
on
my
case
was
unconstitutional
like
wise,
but
the
court
would
have
a
sex-neutral
statute
which
i
would
hope
this
court
would
look
at
it
and
adhere
by
and
therefore
they
could
go
and
listen,
otherwise
it
would
not
automatically
terminate
each
and
every
award
of
alimony
prior
to
the
case
of
orr
v.
orr.
yes,
chief
justice.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
i
can't,
your
honor
sir,
i
can't?
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
i
will
say
they
could
file
probably.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
no
sir,
there
sure
is
not.
mr.
john
l.
capell,
iii
thank
you.
