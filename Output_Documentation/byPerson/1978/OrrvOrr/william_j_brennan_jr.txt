justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
alabama.
it
presents
the
question
whether
the
alabama
alimony
statutes'
effect
in
unconstitutional
gender-based
discrimination.
this
is
because
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
expressly
held
that
there
is
no
authority
in
this
state
for
awarding
alimony
against
the
wife
in
favor
of
the
husband,
the
statutory
scheme
is
to
provide
alimony
only
in
favor
of
the
wife.
the
appellant
husband
in
this
case
challenged
this
statutory
scheme
as
a
gender-based
discrimination
that
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
rejected
the
claim
and
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes.
after
treating
with
three
preliminary
questions
going
to
our
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
appeal
and
finding
all
three
to
be
without
merit,
the
opinion
we
have
filed
for
the
court
addresses
the
merits.
we
reverse
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
alabama
statutory
scheme
of
imposing
alimony
obligations
on
husbands
but
not
wives
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
briefly,
this
is
because
the
statutes
cannot
be
validated
on
the
basis
of
the
state's
preference
for
an
allocation
of
family
responsibilities
under
which
the
wife
plays
a
dependent
role.
no
longer
is
the
female
destined
solely
for
the
home
and
the
rearing
of
the
family,
and
only
the
male
for
the
marketplace
and
world
of
ideas.
though
it
could
be
argued
that
the
alabama
statutory
scheme
is
designed
to
provide
help
for
needy
spouses,
using
sex
as
a
proxy
for
need,
and
to
compensate
women
for
past
discrimination
during
marriage
which
assertedly
has
left
them
unprepared
to
fend
for
themselves
in
the
working
world
following
divorce,
these
considerations
would
not
justify
that
scheme
because
under
the
alabama
statutes
individualized
hearings
at
which
the
parties'
relative
financial
circumstances
are
considered
already
occur
and
have
occurred
for
many
decades.
since
such
hearings
can
determine
which
spouses
are
needy
as
well
as
which
wives
were
in
fact
discriminated
against,
there's
no
reason
to
operate
by
generalization.
thus,
the
gender-based
distinction
made
by
these
statutes
is
gratuitous.
and
use
of
a
gender
classification
moreover
actually
produces
perverse
results
in
this
case,
because
only
a
financially
secure
wife
whose
husband
is
in
need
derives
an
advantage
from
the
alabama
scheme,
as
compared
to
a
gender-neutral
one.
in
other
words,
alabama
legislative
classifications
in
this
instance
distribute
benefits
and
burdens
on
the
basis
of
gender.
we
therefore
carry
the
inherent
risk
of
reinforcing
stereotypes
about
the
proper
place
of
women
in
the
home
and
their
need
for
special
protection.
but
even
statutes
purportedly
designed
to
compensate
for
and
ameliorate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
must
be
carefully
tailored
to
satisfy
the
equal
protection
clause.
our
opinion
demonstrates
that
the
state's
compensatory
and
ameliorative
purposes
are
as
well
served
by
a
gender-neutral
classification
as
by
these
that
gender
classify
and
carry
with
them
the
baggage
of
sexual
stereotypes.
accordingly,
the
constitution
forbids
alabama
to
enact
alimony
statutes
that
classify
on
the
basis
of
sex.
