justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
another
question
relating
to
your
pros
pose
(ph)
standing
here.
your
client
agreed
to
pay
this
alimony.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
make
any
record
at
that
time
as
to
what
he
would
have
done
had
it
not
been
for
the
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
at
the
time
he
signed
the
agreement,
he
made
no
reservation
whatever?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
i
ask
you
now,
why
isn't
he
bound
by
his
agreement?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
agreement
does
not
say,
i
hereby
agree
to
pay
alimony
to
my
wife
only
because
the
statute
of
alabama
does
not
allow
alimony
to
be
paid
to
the
husband;
it
is
just
a
flatter
agreement.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
but
he
undoubtedly
gained
something
or
perceived
that
he
was
gaining
something
from
entering
into
that
agreement,
normally
one
does
not
agree
to
something
without
some
consideration
flowing
to
him
or
her.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
capell,
if
you
prevail
and
the
court
should
hold
that
the
alabama
statute
is
invalid.
would
that
result
in
every
alimony
decree
in
alabama
being
voided?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
statute
under
which
the
decree
was
issued
is
held
to
be
unconstitutional
in
this
case,
why
wouldn't
every
one
of
those
cases
be
analogous
to
your
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
horsley,
what
were
the
grounds
of
divorce
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
you
filed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that
was
a
fault,
wasn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
that
