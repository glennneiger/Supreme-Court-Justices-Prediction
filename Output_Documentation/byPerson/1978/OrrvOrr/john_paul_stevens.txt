justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
capell,
before
you
sit
down
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
is
there
any
case
that
is
inconsistent
with
your
opponent's
theory
that
discrimination
against
men
is
permissible
if
it's
economic
discrimination,
that's
the
heart
of
their
whole
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
can't
one
argue
that
both
of
those
cases
were
discriminations
â€“
well,
let's
see,
those
discriminations
against
men
or
women
as
you
view
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
an
argument
that
the
female
wage
earner
was
the
victim
of
the
discrimination,
because
she
got
less
for
her
social
security
taxes.
if
you
view
them
that
way,
is
there
any
case
that's
inconsistent
with
their
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
they
are
discrimination
against
men
or
women?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
horsley,
let
me
test
that
proposition.
supposing
instead
of
discriminating
between
men
and
women
the
statute
said
that
in
appropriate
case
alimony
may
be
awarded
against
a
black
person,
but
no
alimony
might
be
awarded
against
a
white
person
and
then
there
was
a
divorce
between
two
blacks
and
one
of
them
subsequently
sought
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
even
though
that
person
had
not
affirmed
that
we
sought
alimony,
he
just
been
required
to
pay
alimony,
if
you
say
that
black
person
had
standing
to
attack
the
statute
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alimony
may
be
awarded
against
blacks
only.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
alimony
was
awarded
against
the
black
who
did
not
ask
for
alimony
against
the
other
person
in
the
lawsuit
would
the
black
person
of
standing
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
it
would
either
and
what's
your
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
if
instead
of
a
discrimination
between
men
and
women
it's
where
discrimination
between
blacks
and
whites.
statute
said
alimony
judgments
may
be
entered
against
blacks,
but
not
against
whites
and
such
a
judgment
was
entered
against
the
black
person
and
the
black
person
did
not
ask
for
alimony
from
the
other
spouse,
but
sought
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
would
the
black
person
have
standing
to
make
the
challenge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
because
and
why
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
the
fact
that's
the
statute
that
gives
the
judge
the
right
to
impose
and
to
enter
a
certain
kind
of
judgment
against
one
class
of
persons
against
another
no
other
does
not
give
a
member
that
class
standing
to
attack
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
else
could
once
suffer
the
discrimination
by
being
ordered
to
do
what
the
statute
authorizes
as
against
just
the
members
of
that
class?
how
else
could
he
suffer
the
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
burden
has
been
imposed
upon
him
that's
authorized
only
against
members
of
the
class
of
which
he
is
a
member?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
wife
is
not
needy
but
nevertheless
receives
alimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
causes
could
be
perfectly
properly
ordered
if
you
had
a
wealthy
wife
and
an
extremely
wealthy
husband,
you
might
still
find
that,
that
it's
appropriate
to
have
some
alimony,
would
you
not?
