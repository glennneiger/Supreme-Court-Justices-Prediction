mr.
w.
f.
horsley
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
understand
the
questions
by
the
court
to
mr.
capell
to
be
--
if
he
did
not
ask
for
alimony
himself,
that
is
mr.
orr,
why
would
he
be
able
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
law
which
doesn't
give
him
a
right
to
ask
for
alimony.
i
would
agree
that
he
should
not
have
such
a
right.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
no
sir,
i
do
not,
i
have
not
argue
that
point
up
to
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
no
sir,
he
does
not.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
excuse
me
your
honor,
the
statute
said
that
the
black.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
oh.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
don't
suppose
that
the
standing
question
would
be
any
different
from
this
case.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
am
sorry
i
am
not
certain
that
i
exactly
understand
the
question.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
that's
what
i
am
saying,
no
sir
i
don't
think
that
he
would
any
more
than
mr.
orr
has
standing.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
because
he
hasn't
lost
anything
by
it
since
he
wasn't
asking
for
alimony.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
it
is
my
understanding
that
to
raise
the
constitutional
issue,
you
should
have
suffered
the
discrimination
that
you
are
claiming
is
inherent
in
the
statute
and
if
you
haven't
suffered
the
discrimination,
then
it
is
not
up
to
you
to
raise
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
well.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
mr.
orr
would
have
suffered
discrimination
if
he
had
requested
alimony
and
then
denied
it
because
he
is
saying
the
imperfection
in
the
statute
is
that
it
doesn't
give
him
a
right
to
ask
for
alimony,
but
since
he
has
asked
for
none,
he
has
lost
nothing.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
as
i
understand
this
court's
decisions
since
1971
in
cases
involving
gender
classification
statutes,
it
is
the
law
that
statutes
granting
an
economic
preference
to
women
are
constitutional
and
this
is
so
because
the
court
had
recognized
that
in
this
country
there
has
been
a
long
history
of
economic
discrimination
against
women
and
statutes
designed
to
compensate
for
that
discrimination
deny
or
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
alabama
law
undeniably,
economically
prefers
women,
but
this
preferential
treatment
as
constitutional
we
say
because
of
its
compensatory
function.
mr.
orr,
the
appellant
takes
the
position
that
the
alabama
alimony
law
is
based
an
archaic
notion
that
women
are
not
fit
to
be
self-supporting
and
he
says
the
law
thereby
produces
dependency
of
women.
we
say
that
it
is
precisely
because
of
this
archaic
notion
that
women
are
unfit
to
be
self-supporting
that
the
alabama
law
was
necessary
and
we
say
that
the
alabama
law
does
not
promote
dependency
rather
at
the
time
of
divorce,
dependency
is
already
an
established
fact
because
of
the
discriminations
that
have
been
practiced
against
the
women
in
the
years
leading
up
to
the
divorce.
the
alimony
law
in
alabama
far
from
promoting
dependency
gives
the
women
some
financial
aid
to
help
her
overcome
dependency.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court,
the
circuit
court
of
lee
county
alabama.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
think
that's
the
inference
of
the
trial.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
it
is
not
written
down
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
no
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
under
the
alabama
alimony
law,
in
the
cases
in
alabama
construing
it,
the
trial
judge
takes
in,
is
to
take
in
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
what
i
am
saying
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
would
it
apply
to?
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
but
the
court
would
have
the
discretion
that
to
give
her
alimony.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
that
was
not
pointed,
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
where
is
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
the
--
all
of
the
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
do
not
have
the
cases
in
hand
your
honor
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
no
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
the
decision
depends
on
the
needs
of
the
wife,
the
needs
of
the
husband
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
that
is
possible
under
the
alabama
alimony
law
that
could
perhaps
be
an
abuse
discretion
subject
to
reversal.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
one
word
that.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
think
it
said
that
she
was
in
financial
need.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
oh
from
georgia.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes,
the
trial
court
nearly
approved
the
agreement
that
parties
had
already
entered.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
think
that's
the
effect
of
it,
yes
sir.
let
me
give
an
example
of
what
i
considered
to
be
a
fairly
typical
alimony
case
which
i
think
illustrates
the
justice
of
the
alabama
law.
if
you
assume
that
back
in
1958,
two
persons
20
years
of
age
of
equal
ability
and
intellect
and
competence
were
married,
the
wife
at
that
point
could
well
have
surveyed
the
job
market
and
made
a
decision
to
enter
it.
you
will
understand
we
are
talking
about
1958
and
this
would
be
before
the
equal
pay
act
and
before
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
she
would
see
a
job
market
where
she
would
make
less
wages
than
her
male
counterpart.
she
would
have
less
opportunity
for
advancement
and
perhaps
even
less
opportunity
to
get
employment.
so
this
hypothetical
person
back
in
1958
would
have
decided
quite
reasonably
to
become
a
homemaker
and
the
husband
at
that
point
perhaps
went
to
work
for
a
bank.
20
years
later
they
both
40
years
old,
they
are
getting
a
divorce.
the
husband
at
this
point
is
inline
to
become
president
of
the
bank.
the
wife,
if
she
goes
to
work
for
a
bank
probably
has
to
go
to
work
as
a
secretary
or
a
teller.
the
difference
in
the
financial
rewards
offered
by
the
positions
of
bank
president
versus
bank
secretary
are
obvious,
but
the
differences
do
not
exist
because
the
man
is
more
competent
than
the
woman.
the
difference
exists
because
of
the
discriminations
against
the
woman
that
steered
her
into
her
role
as
homemaker
and
cost
her
to
forgo
the
education
and
the
training
and
the
experience
that
would
have
today
qualified
her
for
the
better
job
in
the
better
paying
position
in
the
more
responsible
position.
under
these
circumstances,
we
say
under
alabama
law
it's
entirely
proper
to
compensate
her
to
make
up
for
the
opportunity
that
she
lost
because
of
the
discrimination
she
faced
back
at
that
time.
now
the
appellant
has
made
the
point
that
there
are
some
men
who
are
dependent
on
their
wives
and
they
need
alimony
in
the
event
of
a
divorce.
that's
true
and
to
illustrate
that
factual
situation,
let
me
reverse
my
example
and
suppose
that
this
woman
back
in
1958
had
in
spite
of
the
discrimination
she
saw
in
the
job
market,
gone
ahead
and
gone
to
work
for
the
bank
and
the
husband
became
a
homemaker.
if
they
were
divorced
today
it
would
be
the
husband
who
had
the
greater
financial
need
than
the
wife,
but
under
alabama
law
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
alimony,
but
the
big
difference
here
is
that
he
would
find
himself
in
financial
need
by
choice
rather
than
force.
when
he
surveyed
the
job
market
back
in
1958,
he
did
not
find
it
unreceptive
to
him
as
it
was
unreceptive
to
his
wife.
if
he
stayed
out
of
the
labor
force
it
was
not
because
of
any
discriminations
against
him
and
he
would
not
have
any
claims
under
a
statute
which
is
designed
to
compensate
for
past
discrimination.
i
think
this
very
point
was
noted
in
one
of
the
dissents
in
kahn
versus
shevin
where
it
was
said
while
doubtless
some
widowers
are
in
financial
need,
no
one
suggests
that
such
need
results
from
sex
discrimination
as
in
the
case
of
widows.
i
think
that
the
same
thing
could
be
said
of
divorcee
as
was
the
set
of
widows.
many
states
do
have
laws
which
provide
for
alimony
to
man
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
such
laws
if
that
type
of
law
is
worth
the
legislature
that
state
determines
represents
the
will
of
its
people
but
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
legislation
must
be
designed
in
that
fashioned
to
be
constitutional.
this
is
a
decision
for
the
state
legislatures
to
make
and
alabama
has
determined
that
its
compensatory
alimony
law
thus
represent
the
will
of
its
people.
so
but
for
the
archaic
notions
regarding
women
the
opportunities
would
not
have
been
denied
them,
an
alimony
wouldn't
be
necessary.
since
1971,
this
court
has
repeatedly
acknowledged
the
fact
that
woman
have
been
denied
equal
opportunities
in
the
business
world.
in
the
majority
opinion
in
kahn
versus
shevin
it
was
said
there
can
be
no
dispute
that
the
financial
difficulties
confronting
the
lone
woman
in
florida
or
any
other
state
exceed
those
facing
men.
in
every
sex
discrimination
case
of
this
court
since
1971,
it
has
been
held
that
if
the
challenge
statute
granted
an
economic
preference
to
woman,
it
is
constitutional.
dissenting
in
kahn
versus
shevin,
justices
brennan
and
marshall
argued
that
florida
tax
exemption
statute
was
over
inclusive
because
need
was
not
considered
under
the
terms
of
that
statute.
under
that
statute,
a
wealthy
woman
who
had
not
suffered
from
discrimination
would
have
the
same
tax
exemption
that
a
poor
woman
would
have.
but
i
am
taking
the
position
that
the
alabama
alimony
law
is
not
subject
to
that
attack
because
alimony
in
alabama
is
not
mandatory.
it's
up
to
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
awarded.
need
is
certainly
a
consideration
to
the
used
value
judge
in
exercising
his
discretion.
in
califano
versus
webster,
this
court
held
that
statutes
economically
preferring
women
constitutional
unless
one
of
two
circumstances
existed,
unless
the
law
has
actually
the
effect
of
penalizing
woman
such
as
in
the
wiesenfeld
case
or
the
law
was
not
intended
is
compensation.
we
have
tried
to
demonstrate
today
that
alabama's
law
doesn't
penalize
woman
because
it
doesn't
produce
dependency,
it
doesn't
steer
them
into
a
role
as
a
homemaker
and
make
them
dependent
on
their
husbands.
as
i
have
said
i
thank
dependency
is
already
established
by
the
time
of
divorce.
the
roles
to
be
played
by
the
parties
to
a
marriage
are
ordinarily
selected
at
the
beginning
of
the
marriage.
i
don't
think
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
marriages
are
begun
in
anticipation
of
divorce.
so
the
prospect
of
alimony
should
not
be
a
significant
factor
in
the
selection
of
roles
by
the
parties.
in
any
event
alimony
speculative
is
to
where
it
will
be
awarded
or
not.
mr.
capell
mentioned
that
he
thought
perhaps
in
25%
of
the
cases
there
was
no
alimony
award
made.
i
have
no
statistics
to
back
me
up.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
not
in
the
divorce
decree
because
it
was
agreed
upon
by
the
parties.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
no
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes,
if
the
wife
has
no
separate
estate
or
if
it
is
insufficient
for
her
maintenance.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
that
it
is
your
honor
but
the
alimony
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir
it
is.
yes
sir
but
–
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
well,
i
don't
think
absent
an
alimony
statute
at
the
lower
court
would
have
had
jurisdiction
to
even
approve
that
agreement
providing
for
alimony,
if
there
weren't
some
statutory
basis
for
alimony.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir,
that's
true.
the
court
so
far
as
acted,
took
no
testimony
and
made
no
investigation.
it
simply
approved
the
parties'
settlement
agreement.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
it
certainly
has
the
discretion
to
do
that
and
it
can
be
done
either
way.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
it
will
depend
on
which
judge
i
will
--
in
my
own
personal
experience,
judges
would
ordinarily
approve
whatever
agreement
parties
have
made,
the
judges
that
i
have
dealt
with.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
the
court
has
approved
that
sort
of
an
agreement,
i
don't
know
that
one
has
been
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes,
nearly,
now
they
are
many
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
there
are
many
property
settlement
agreements
where
the
husband
for
instance
ends
up
with
the
home
or
the
car.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
know
of
no
cases
where
the
hosts
been
has
ended
up
with
a
sum
of
money
to
be
paid
on
the
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
know
of
none
where
it
was
the
wife
separate
estate.
they
are
many
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
no
sir.
there
are
many
cases
so
where
the
parties
own
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
jointly
with
survivorship
for
instance.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
think
that
it's
legal
under
the
alabama
law
because
they
can
make
an
attempt
to
determine
whose
property
is
whose
at
the
end
of
the
marriage.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
well,
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
where
property
that
would
have
truly
be
nothing
but
the
wife's
could
be
awarded
to
the
husband.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
think
it
probably
would
--
yes
i
think
it
would.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
think
these
are
the
only
ones
your
honor.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
he
was
there
at
the
time
of
the
divorce
and
at
the
time
he
raised
his
constitutional
challenge
some
several
years
later,
he
had
moved
to
california.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir
that
is
not
the
final
judgment
of
divorce
this
is
the
judgment
that
the
court
entered
at
the
time
he
made
the
constitutional
challenge
and
he
lived
in
california
then.
you
see
this
is
dated
1976,
the
divorce
actually
occurred
back
in
either
1973
or
1974.
again,
looking
at
the
califano
versus
webster
decision,
the
court
there
said
that
compensatory
legislation
should
have
been
intended
as
such
to
be
constitutional.
the
appellant
of
course
has
argued
that
the
alabama
law
was
not
intended
as
compensation,
because
he
says
that
it
grows
out
of
the
husband's
common
law
obligation
of
support.
we
say
that
the
husband's
common
law
obligation
of
support
was
intended
as
compensation
and
alimony
merely
continues
that
obligation
after
marriage.
the
alabama
appellate
courts
have
viewed
the
obligation
of
support
as
compensation
to
the
wife
or
the
rights
taken
from
her
by
marriage
such
as
the
right
of
contract,
the
right
to
own
property
in
her
own
name.
these
rights
were
stripped
from
the
women
in
common
law
and
it
was
because
of
the
scrapping
of
those
rights,
it's
my
understanding
and
contention
that
alimony
was
granted
to
the
wife
to
make
up
for
that.
now,
it
should
be
noted
on
the
question
of
intent,
what
the
legislation
intended.
this
court
approved
florida's
tax
exemption
statute
in
kahn
v.
shevin
presumably,
determining
that
the
florida
legislature
had
a
compensatory
intent
in
mind.
the
florida
statute
was
passed
in
1885.
alabama's
alimony
law
was
passed
in
1854,
only
31
years
separated
the
passage
of
these
laws.
there
is
no
reason
i
think
to
attribute
a
more
benign
purpose
to
the
florida
legislature
than
to
the
alabama
legislature,
but
this
court
found
that
florida's
purpose
was
compensatory,
certainly
alabama's
ought
to
be
found
to
be
compensatory
also.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
he
did,
no
sir.
that's
true,
he
did
not
voluntarily
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
that's
true.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
well
his
attorney
was
there
to
file
the
special
appearance
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
in
1976.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
don't
know
why
he
appeared
specially.
there
is
a
provision
for
special
appearances
ordinarily,
if
you
have
some
matter
in
abatement,
you
appear
specially.
but
i
see
no
real
reason
for
him
to
appeal
it
specially
to
challenge
constitutionality.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
adultery.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
however
i
will
have
to
admit
that
the
lower
court
did
not
make
any
finding
as
to
whether
our
the
allegations
were
supported
in
that,
since
we
agreed
on
the
divorce
and
the
property
settlement.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
well,
we
do
have
no
file
divorce
in
alabama,
incompatibility
is
also
ground
for
the
divorce.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
i
think
52
your
honor,
wasn't
--
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
oh,
51
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
f.
horsley
yes
sir.
in
conclusion,
alabama's
alimony
law
we
contend
passes
the
test
devised
by
this
court
in
kahn
v.
shevin
and
califano
versus
webster.
now
on
that
basis,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
hold
alabama
statute
constitutional.
