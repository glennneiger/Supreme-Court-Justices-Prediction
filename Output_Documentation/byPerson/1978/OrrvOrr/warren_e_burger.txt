chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1119,
orr
against
orr.
mr.
capell,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
there
was
something
in
the
nature
of
role
casting
and
stereotyping
in
kahn
against
shevin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
accept
that,
but
in
this
case,
in
this
particular
case,
what
is
that,
that
your
client
was
deprived
of?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
say
to
the
court,
i
want
$500
a
month
because
the
statute
which
we
have
had
here
is
an
unconstitutional
statute
and
you
must
give
me
the
same
treatment
that
you
give
to
the
wives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
doesn't
the
posture
of
the
case
the
same
as
though
they
had
denied
review
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
cannot
bind
the
other
members
of
the
court
by
any
characterization
that
he
puts
on
in
a
single
opinion,
can
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
opinion
by
judge
holmes,
is
that
what
you
are
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
the
divorce
court
relying
on
a
settlement
agreement
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
[voice
overlap]
as
mr.
justice
powell
pointed
out,
the
court
didn't
have
to
make
any
decision
except
to
pass
on
the
settlement
agreement,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
are
several
others
who
were
driving
at,
--
trying
to
drive
that;
wasn't
the
time
for
him
to
raise
any
constitutional
question
at
the
negotiation
stage
in
which
he
would
refuse
to
agree
to
pay
anything
and
then
he
might
be
ordered
to
pay
it
and
then
he
would
challenge
the
validity
of
that
order
on
the
grounds
that
you
are
now
trying
to
raise
here
and
that
the
way
of
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
capell.
mr.
horsley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
tell
us
some
early
points
whether
you
think
there
is
a
case
here
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
the
trail
court
didn't
have
to
worry
about
too
much
when
he
had
an
agreement
to
the
husband
to
pay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
didn't
have
to
do
any
measuring
of
need
because
the
parties
between
themselves
had
arrived
in
agreement
on
the
need
and
on
the
obligation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
a
reason
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
intervening
where
as
the
agreement
of
the
parties
which
made
it
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
make
any
findings,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
appear
especially
in
your
state
and
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
which
isn't
implicated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
you
don't
grant
divorces
by
stipulation
in
alabama,
do
you?
there
must
have
been
at
least
in
implicit
finding
of
faults
or
the
court
wouldn't
have
the
jurisdiction,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
1119,
orr
against
orr
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
