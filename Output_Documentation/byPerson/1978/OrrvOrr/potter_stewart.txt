justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
the
real
reason
is
that
court
ordered
your
client
to
pay
alimony?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
there
wouldn't
have
been
an
order
to
the
alimony
unless
the
court
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
thought
that
such
an
order
was
appropriate.
justice
potter
stewart
did
your
client
ask
for
alimony
in
the
divorce
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
why
--
the
question
on
my
mind
and
perhaps
you
can
satisfy,
that
didn't
seem
to
bother
the
court
of
your
state
as
why
this
is
a
case
of
controversy
if
your
client
didn't
ask
for
alimony?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
claim
is
that,
as
i
understand
it
that
this
law
of
your
state
is
unconstitutional
because
it
authorizes
a
court
to
award
alimony
only
to
a
wife
at
the
expense
of
a
husband?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
but
such
there
could
be
a
law,
preferably
constitutional
law
in
your
submission
that
authorized
a
court
to
order
alimony
to
either
party
in
a
divorce.
in
any
event
this
case,
the
court
ordered
your
client
to
pay
alimony.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
how
this
controversy
arises
unless
or
until
there
should
be
a
case
in
which
the
divorcing
husband
asks
for
alimony
from
the
wife
and
the
court
of
your
state
said,
no
i'd
like
to
give
it,
it
should
be
given
in
this
case,
but
i
can't
under
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
nor
does
your
case
as
approaching
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
generally
the
husband
is
of
the
male
sex.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me
mr.
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
capell,
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
up
you
again,
but
just
so
i
understand.
my
brother
rehnquist
in
his
question
referred
to
the
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
quashing
the
writ
of
certiorari
as
improvidently
granted
and
then
judge
almon
or
justice
almon
says
i
concurred
in
affirming
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
is
the
effect
of
quashing
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
as
improvidently
granted
in
your
state,
the
same
as
affirming
the
court
of
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
course
that
is
quite
alien
to
the
tradition
and
practice
and
rule
here
in
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
question
--
justice
almon
concurring
in
the
quashing
of
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted
says,
i
concur
in
affirming
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
so
does
that
mean
that
it
was
affirmed?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
are
affirming
a
judgment
of
the
court
to
which
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
directed?
justice
potter
stewart
are
they
affirming
it
or
they
simply
dismissing
it
or
quashing
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
â€“
you
are
a
alabama
lawyer
and
you
could
presumably
tell
us
about
the
practices
in
your
state?
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
affirm?
justice
potter
stewart
he
says
he
concurs
in
affirming.
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
he
would
--
not
that
he
individually
would
affirm?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
suggesting
that
in
every
divorce
in
alabama,
the
husband
is
ordered
to
pay
alimony?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
your
client
was
entitled
had
the
alabama
statute
authorized
and
allowed
it
that
your
client
was
entitled
alimony
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
certainly
have
said
we
don't
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
my
client
shouldn't
pay
alimony
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
told
me
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
said
that.
legions
of
cases
in
alabama,
divorce
cases
the
husband
is
not
ordered
to
pay
alimony,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
the
circumstances
of
that
particular
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
your
client
one
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why,
he
didn't
even
say,
he
didn't
owe
any
alimony
himself?
justice
potter
stewart
let
alone
ask
for
any
from
his
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
are
certainly
permitted
as
you
just
told
me
to
say
you
didn't
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
owe
the
divorced
wife
any
alimony
at
all,
but
you
didn't
do
that.
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
sex-neutral
or
whatever,
you
never
took
the
position
that
you
did
not
owe
alimony
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
until
this
constitutional
attack
on
the
statute
itself.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
you
never
took
the
position
that
there
should
be
no
alimony
award
against
you?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
tell
me,
it
was
wholly
permissible
in
alabama
for
you
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
the
contempt
citation
drew
out
of
a
court
decree
not
out
of
any
statute,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
court
decree
was
based
upon
the
circumstances
of
this
case
in
which
the
court
founded
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
your
client
should
pay
his
divorced
wife
alimony.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
relying
on
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
state
statute
doesn't
require
alimony
that
it
doesn't
pay
alimony
in
every
case,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
(inaudible)
proceed.
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
the
existing
alabama
law,
you
have
told
me
that
a
divorcing
husband
is
entirely
free
to
make
the
point
that
he
doesn't
--
he
shouldn't
be
ordered
to
pay
his
wife
anything
by
way
of
alimony
and
you
never
even
went
that
far.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
alabama
divorces
do
you
would
suppose
there
are
where
there
is
no
alimony
award
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
can't
put
a
percentage
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
not
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that's
perfectly
permissible
under
alabama
law?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
the
need
of
the
woman,
including
her
age
and
the
circumstances
of
the
misconduct
alleged
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
we
all
know
that
but
you
didn't
even
take
that
position,
let
alone
that
you
are
entitled
to
alimony
from
the
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
make
that
point
in
your
brief
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
but
presumably
a
court
wouldn't
order
her
husband
to
pay
her
alimony.
justice
potter
stewart
she
herself
had
an
income
of
$80
million?
justice
potter
stewart
in
an
alabama
divorce,
does
the
husband
always
required
to
pay
alimony?
justice
potter
stewart
and
upon
what
does
the
decision
to
order
him
to
pay
alimony
depend?
justice
potter
stewart
the
needs
of
the
wife
and
among
other
things.
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
include
an
agreement
under
which
the
wife
conveyed
property
to
the
husband?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
marriage
between
a
reasonably
impecunious
husband
and
a
reasonably
affluent
wife.
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
divorce
comes
along
depending
upon
their
then
relative
needs,
relative
ages
and
relative
ability
to
get
jobs
and
what
not,
the
number
of
children
and
so
on,
where
the
cost
is
going
to
be,
it's
not
unusual
to
that
elementary
fairness
would
seem
to
dictate
that
there
should
be
a
conveyance
of
property
from
the
wife
to
the
husband
and
many
settlement
agreements
are
made
in
various
jurisdictions
providing?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
ever
heard
of
such
a
settlement
agreement
in
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
know
of
many
occasions
where
there
has
been
a
conveyance
of
the
wife's
property
of
any
kind
to
the
husband
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
community
property
in
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
jointly
owner.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
husband
has
given
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
use
and
occupancy
of
that
property?
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be,
is
that
just
because
certain
trial
judges
kind
of
wink
at
the
provisions
of
the
alabama
statute
or
do
you
think
that's
legal
under
alabama
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
at
the
end
of
the
finding
is
that
this
nominally
jointly
held
property
is
really
the
husband's
property,
well
that's
quite
different?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
talking,
i
am
not
asking
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
a
legal
under
alabama
law?
if
the
settlement
agreement
is
reached
on
those
lines?
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
a
careful
lawyer
who
was
kind
of
preserve
--
justice
potter
stewart
51
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
it
had
to
be.
