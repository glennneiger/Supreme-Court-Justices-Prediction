justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
particular
provision
of
alabama's
law
was
certainly
designed
to
prefer
women,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
capell.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
we
to
take
it
from
the
procedural
history
in
the
appellate
courts
in
alabama
in
this
case?
i
take
it
that
the
court
of
appeals,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
did
pass
on
the
constitutional
question
which
you
raised
and
it
ruled
against
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right,
and
then
you
petitioned
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
for
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
simply
did
not
write
an
opinion,
it
simply
held
that
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
quashed
as
improvidently
granted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
do
we
have
any
opinion
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
alabama
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
take
it
he
concurred
specially
because
the
majority
did
not
agree
with
it,
that
is
what
the
experience
we
usually
have
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
majority
are
simply
silent
and
i
am
wondering
in
view
of
our
long
established
rule
that
one
must
raise
the
constitutional
issue
at
the
very
first
point
in
any
state
proceeding
and
must
renew
it
throughout
that
if
justice
powell's
question
to
you
does
not
suggest
that
perhaps
the
supreme
of
alabama
thought
the
alabama
appellate
court
was
wrong
in
passing
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
issue?
the
if
the
result
was
right,
but
that
it
simply
should
not
have
opined
on
the
constitutionality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
talking
about
standing
mr.
capell.
i
am
talking
about
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
which
is
the
highest
court
of
alabama,
in
fact
did
give
a
judgment
on
a
constitutional
question
which
is
properly
now
before
this
court.
i
realize
the
intermediate
appellate
court
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
an
alabama
court
would
have
been
presented
with
a
settlement
agreement,
you're
bound
to
inquire
on
its
own
and
to
whether
the
wife
was
needy
or
not
or
whether
it
simply
approved
the
settlement
agreement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
normal
practicer
or
does
it
just
depend
on
which
judge
it
happened
to
be
before?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
are
the
statutes
that
we
have
been
questioning
both
you
and
your
opponent
about
on
page
3
of
the
jurisdictional
statute,
do
30-2-51-52-53
deal
only
with
alimony
or
do
they
deal
with
distribution
of
property
among
the
parties
to
or
are
there
other
sections
of
the
alabama
court
to
deal
with
the
distribution
of
the
property
upon
the
break
up
of
the
marriage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
these
deal
with
both?
