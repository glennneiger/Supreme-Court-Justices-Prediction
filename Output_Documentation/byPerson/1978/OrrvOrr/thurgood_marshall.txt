justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
didn't
protest
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
protest
this
alimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
didn't?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
sign
a
piece
of
paper
saying,
now
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
payer
of
alimony
in
alabama
today
who
wouldn't
have
the
same
result
if
you

justice
thurgood
marshall
could
every
man
who've
been
divorced
and
has
paid
alimony
in
alabama
today,
would
he
have
any
readdress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
this
is
a
man
who
never
litigated
this
point
any
place,
and
he
just
comes
in
and
say,
i
want
my
money
back.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
never
raised
this
point,
you
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
case
said
that
anybody
who
had
not
litigated
this
point
can
come
in
on
a
contemporaries
and
win,
isn't
it
what
your
case
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
get
back
to
the
present
day.
you
said
there
was
an
opinion
of
court
of
appeals,
i
can't
find
it,
it's
just
nowhere.
so,
where
is
the
opinion
that
declares
this
statute
constitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
10-a.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
order
of
15-a,
that's
the
order
on
15-a.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see,
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
all
of
the
alimony
cases
that
were
handed
down
the
same
day
this
when
was
handed
down,
could
they
all
file?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
could,
they
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
no
magic,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
there
in
this
regular
suit,
mrs.
lillian
orr
is
dependent
on
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
says
that,
says
that
she
is
dependent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
ask
where
did
it
say
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
not
in
this
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
can
you
argue
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
apply
to
a
woman
who
has
an
independent
income
of
$80
million,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
it
would.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
where
does
that
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
case
you've
got
is
mr.
justice
stewart
is
talking
about
so
far?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
any
â€“
thought
beside
that
in
the
alabama
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
is
real
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
the
wife
of
a
broken
marriage
who
need
financial
assistance
for
whom
the
alimony
statutes
of
alabama
were
designed,
i
don't
say
one
word
about
married
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
she
had
a
broken
marriage,
this
will
entitle
her
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
from
the
georgia
supreme
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
adopted
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
page
12a.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
agreed
on
both?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
agreed
that
she
needed
it
and
he
had
it,
they
agreed
on
both?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
statute
got
to
do
with
the
agreement?
the
agreement
said
that
she
needed
and
he
had.
you
know
what
the
agreement
said,
he
paid
her
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
do
you
need?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
to
have
residence
for
a
divorce
in
alabama?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
noticed
that
he
wasn't
there
at
the
divorce.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
reading
that
the
complaint
lillian
appeared
with
her
attorney
on
page
17-a.
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me
(inaudible)
still
worries
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
mr.
orr
was
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
the
original
divorce
action,
why
did
he
file
this
motion
specially?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
on
august
19,
this
is
the
order
of
the
court.
the
respondent
william
orr
appears
specially.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
still
say
he
did
appear
in
person
at
some
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
the
divorce
itself
was
granted,
was
he
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
would
he
come
in
specially?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
