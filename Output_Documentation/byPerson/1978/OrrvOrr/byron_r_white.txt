justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
capell,
yeah
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
in
responding
to
your
claim
had
ruled
that
is
as
it
did
on
the
constitute
--
but
then
said
even
if
you
are
wrong
on
this
nevertheless
the
statute
would
still
--
we
would
still
interrupt
the
statute
is
requiring
alimony
based
on
need
as
to
either
person
and
in
this
case,
it
is
already
been
determined
in
the
divorce
court
in
effect
that
the
wife
was
needy
and
that
the
husband
could
pay
it
and
the
husband
doesn't
challenge
that
here
so
we
are
just
not
going
to
change
the,
we
are
just
going
to
rule
against
him
here.
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
said
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
as
an
alimony
order,
denying
or
granting
alimony
to
the
wife
ever
been
reversed
by
an
alabama
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
husband
is
ordered
to
pay
alimony
and
he
appeals,
has
he
ever
won?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
he
ever
won
in
an
alabama
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
whatever
ground,
on
whatever
ground,
but
so
that
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
if
it
had
expressly
said
that
there
is
already
outstanding
a
court
order
for
the
payment
of
alimony
and
it
has
never
been
challenged.
you
did
not
challenge
after
that
point
except
on
the
constitutional
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
doesn't
need
to
deny
the
wife's
need?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
horsley
was
there
a
finding
of
fault
in
this
divorce
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
is
no
necessity
under
the
alabama
law
to
find
--
to
assign
a
fault
to
issue
the
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
i
take
it
then
that
the
alimony
order
which
the
court
made
must
have
been
issued
under
section
30-2-51
since
the
other
two
sections
that
deal
with
when
fault
is
found
and
that
section
expressly
conditions
alimony
upon
the
wife's
estate
being
inadequate
for
her
support.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
if
that
is
the
section
under
which
this
court
this
particular
divorce
court
proceeded,
mustn't
we
assume
that
there
is
a
finding
that
her
estate
was
insufficient.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
certainly
was
a
court
order
to
pay
it,
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
wasn't
paid,
the
non-payer
might
be
held
in
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
order
was
valid,
it
was
valid
because
position
under
this
particular
section?
