mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
presents
the
question
whether
a
district
court
may
properly
suppress
probative
and
otherwise
admissible
evidence
of
a
crime
merely
because
the
government
agency
failed
to
follow
internal
regulations
that
imposed
duties
upon
it
not
required
either
by
the
constitution
or
by
statute.
we
contend
that
suppression
is
inappropriate
remedy
in
such
circumstances;
especially
where
as
in
this
case,
the
agency
regulation
at
issue
was
not
intended
to
grant
enforceable
rights
to
individual
defendants.
the
violation
of
the
regulation
was
isolated
and
was
not
committed
in
bad
faith
and
the
defendant
has
been
unable
to
demonstrate
any
prejudice
as
a
result
of
the
violation.
the
facts
of
this
case
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
in
january
1975,
agent
robert
yee
of
the
internal
revenue
service
was
ordered
in
respondent's
individual
and
unemployment
tax
returns
for
the
year
1971.
at
the
conclusion
of
a
meeting
between
respondent
and
agent
yee
on
january
27,
1975,
respondent
proposed
the
so-called
personal
settlement
of
his
tax
difficulties.
he
offered
agent
yee
a
$1,000.00
if
the
agent
would
reduce
his
estimated
tax
liabilities
by
about
one-third.
agent
yee
immediately
reported
this
bribe
offer
to
inspector
hill
of
the
irs
internal
security
division.
at
hill's
direction,
agent
yee
called
respondent
on
january
the
30th
and
arranged
the
meeting
for
the
following
day
at
respondent's
office.
during
this
meeting,
respondent
gave
agent
yee
a
partial
payment
of
$500.00
for
settling
the
tax
audit
as
respondent
had
earlier
suggested.
unbeknownst
to
respondent,
this
conversation
was
recorded
by
agent
yee
by
means
of
a
tape
recorder
concealed
on
the
agent's
person.
agent
yee
also
met
with
respondent
on
february
the
6th
and
february
the
11th
1975.
at
the
february
6th
meeting,
respondent
offered
agent
yee,
an
additional
$2,000.00
to
audit
his
1973
and
1974
individual
income
tax
returns
to
respondent's
satisfaction.
and
on
february
11th,
respondent
gave
agent
yee
$500.00
as
the
second
installment
for
the
favorable
termination
of
the
1971
audit.
the
february
6th
and
february
11th
meetings
were
also
secretly
recorded
by
agent
yee.
the
respondent
was
subsequently
indicted
on
three
counts
of
bribery
prior
to
the
second
trial
on
these
charges.
he
moved
to
suppress
the
three
tape
recordings
on
the
ground
that
they
have
not
been
properly
authorized
under
the
applicable
irs
internal
regulations
governing
consensual
monitoring
of
face-to-face
conversations
between
agents
and
taxpayers.
those
regulations
require
that
except
in
exigent
circumstances
advanced
approval
for
such
monitoring,
must
be
obtained
by
the
director
of
the
irs
internal
security
division
from
appropriate
officials
in
the
department
of
justice.
the
irs
man
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there's
a
--
the
regulation
also
applies
to
telephone
monitoring
but
there
are
there
are
different
authorization
requirements
there
and
they're
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
approval
of
the
department
of
justice
is
not
required
for
telephone,
consensual
telephone
monitoring,
only
for
consensual
face-to-face
monitoring
of
conversations.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
sparse
history
that's
available
to
explain
the
reasons
for
the
adoption
of
these
regulations
does
suggest,
yes,
that
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
attorney
general
thought
it
was
marginally
more
intrusive
of
possible
privacy
rights
to
have
face-to-face
conversations
recorded
than
telephone
conversations.
the
theory
being
that
conversations
over
telephone
are
going
through
wires,
through
offices,
and
circuits
and
there's
just
less
reasonable
of
an
expectation
that
they're
not
being
overheard.
of
course,
consensual
monitoring
either
by
telephone
or
by
face-to-face
regulations
as
i'll
get
to
face-to-face
conversations
doesn't
implicate
the
either
fourth
amendment
or
any
statute.
and
the
irs
manual
also
provides
that
when
exigent
circumstances
are
present,
emergency
authorization
for
consensual
monitoring
may
be
given
by
the
director
of
the
irs
internal
security
division
acting
alone.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case,
show
that
on
either
january
the
30th
or
january
the
31st
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's
a
judgment
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
the
exigent
circumstances
that
the
regulations
refer
to
are
merely
matter
of
time
that's
involved
before
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
definition
and
interpretation
of
an
internal
regulation
promulgated
by
an
agency
should
be
for
that
agency
and
that
agency
alone.
now
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
found
that
the
emergency
provisions
of
the
irs
manual
were
violated.
while
we
disagree
with
that
conclusion,
we
haven't
challenged
it
in
this
court.
and
this
court,
this
case
reaches
this
court
on
the
assumption
that
the
regulations
were
in
fact
violated.
the
question
is
merely
what
the
remedy
should
be.
now,
as
i
was
saying
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
after
agent
yee
had
arranged
the
january
31st
meeting
with
respondent,
but
before
that
meeting
took
place,
inspector
hill
applied
for
authorization
to
monitor
the
conversations
between
respondent
and
agent
yee.
the
request
was
transmitted
to
the
irs
national
office
here
in
washington
on
january
31st
but
other
county
was
not
forwarded
to
the
justice
department
until
february
the
7th.
as
a
result
of
this
delay,
the
director
of
the
irs
internal
security
division
acting
pursuant
to
the
exigent
circumstances
provision
of
the
irs
manual
gave
emergency
approval
to
record
the
january
31st
and
february
6th
conversations
between
respondent
and
agent
yee.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
hesitate
to
answer
that
question.
in
the
abstract,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
properly
both
that
the
statutory
issue
should
be
resolved
before
the
constitutional
one.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
have
not
challenged
in
this
court
that
the
regulation
was
violated.
i'm
not
aware
what
standards
the
court
would
bring
to
resolve
any
question
like
that
if
the
agency
itself
says
that
the
regulation
hasn't
violated
but
that's
part
and
parcel
of
the
larger
argument
that
we
make
here
today
that
an
agency
regulation,
the
violation
of
a
regulation
standing
alone
does
not
give
anyone
any
legal
rights
that
are
enforceable
to
court.
it's
our
position
which
i
hope
to
elaborate
on
later
the
argument.
but
only
if
the
defendant
is
worse
off
by
the
promulgation
and
violation
of
an
agency
regulation
then
he
would
be
if
the
agency
had
not
promulgated
the
regulation
at
all,
might
it
be
appropriate
for
the
court
in
construing
the
due
process
clause
to
grant
some
form
of
relief.
now
the
justice
department
eventually
approved
the
irs
consensual
monitoring
request
on
february
the
10th
and
therefore
the
recording
of
the
february
11th
meeting
was
fully
authorized
in
advance.
in
full
compliance
with
the
irs
manual
and
it's
not
an
issue
here.
based
on
this
evidence
the
district
court
granted
respondent's
motion
to
suppress
the
recordings
of
the
january
31st
and
february
6th
meetings,
the
court
found
that
no
true
exigency
existed
and
that
irs
agent
said
therefore
violated
the
procedures
in
the
irs
manual
by
not
obtaining
approval
from
the
department
of
justice.
the
government
appealed
the
suppression
ruling
but
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
i
think
it's
important
to
begin
on
discussion
of
this
case
by
asking
a
critical
question
that
court
of
appeals
never
attempted
to
answer
and
that
is,
what
is
the
source
of
the
district
court's
power
to
suppress
the
highly
probative
tape
recordings
of
respondent's
conversations
with
agent
yee
merely
because
of
the
violation
of
an
internal
government
regulation?
first,
there
are
several
--
few
answers
to
these
questions
seem
reasonably
clear.
first,
the
power
can't
be
found
in
the
regulation
itself.
the
irs
manual
doesn't
contain
an
exclusionary
rule
and
indeed
it
specifically
provides
for
the
wholly
separate
remedy
of
disciplinary
action
in
appropriate
cases
against
irs
agents
who
violate
the
manual.
it's
also
clear
that
the
authority
to
suppress
can't
be
found
in
the
fourth
amendment
or
in
any
federal
statute.
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
vacations
that
consensual
recording
of
face-to-face
conversations
does
not
constitute
a
search
or
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
title
iii
also
specifically
excludes
consensual
recordings
by
law
enforcement
officers
from
its
provisions.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
purport
to
be
ordering
the
suppression
of
evidence
here
as
an
exercise
of
its
supervisory
powers.
and
hence,
whatever
the
legitimacy
of
the
court
ever
using
its
supervisory
powers
to
exclude
probative
evidence
in
a
criminal
case
because
of
an
agency's
violation
of
its
own
rules
we
have
substantial
data
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
that
case
we
still
think
it
would
be
up
to
the
agency
itself
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
seek
enforcement
of
hat
provision
as
in
fact
it
does
in
the
petite
--
as
the
department
of
justice
does
in
petite
policy
cases.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
or
whether
or
not
to
in
effect
pro
tanto
repeal
that
provision
we
think
the
courts
cannot
step
unless
unconstitutional
or
statutory
right
of
the
defendant
has
been
violated.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
gather,
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
see
the
district
court
would
have
supervisory
power
presumably
the
argument
would
go
would
have
supervisory
powers
over
an
agency
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
determine
whether
the
district
court
has
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
want
to
be
put
in
the
position
of
defending
supervisory
powers
of
courts
over
executive
branch
agencies
because
the
position
of
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
took
the
position
in
the
jacobs
case
last
year
that
district
courts
don't
have
any
broad
undefined
supervisory
powers
and
that's
still
the
position
of
the
justice
department.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
although
in
the
jacobs'
case,
there
was
a
question
of
how
united
states
attorney
or
strike
force
attorney
should
act
in
a
particular
situation.
well,
that
leaves
us
with
the
claim
that
respondent
urges
most
strongly
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
accepted
which
is
that
the
power
to
exclude
the
tape
recordings
flows
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
as
we
understand
respondent's
argument,
he
says
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process,
every
agency
must
promulgate
internal
regulations
restricting
the
unfettered
discretion
of
its
employees.
every
agent,
every
employee
must
abide
by
the
regulations
of
his
agency.
in
every
violation
of
an
internal
regulation
constitutes
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
key
assertion
is
obviously
the
last
one
that
is
that
any
time
an
agency
fails
to
comply
with
one
of
its
mandatory
guidelines.
the
person
with
whom
the
agency
is
dealing
has
been
denied
due
process.
the
respondent
relies
for
this
assertion
solely
upon
cases
such
as
accardi
against
shaughnessy
and
service
against
dulles.
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
last
term
in
board
of
curators
against
horowitz,
that
line
of
cases
merely
announces
a
rule
of
federal
administrative
law
not
a
principle
of
constitutional
law
applicable
in
non-adjudicated
context.
and
these
decisions
certainly
didn't
equate
every
violation
of
an
agency's
regulation
whether
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
indeed,
sullivan
against
the
united
states
in
348
u.s.
was
decided
only
a
few
months
after
accardi.
yet
the
court
failed
to
mention
accardi
in
denying
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
an
indictment
in
that
case
because
of
the
violation
of
an
internal
agency
procedure.
i
should
make
clear
that
we
certainly
don't
dispute
that
there
may
be
circumstances
where
the
government's
failure
to
follow
procedures
outlined
in
its
internal
regulations
might
operate
to
treat
a
particular
defendant
unfairly.
it
might
cause
the
defendant
demonstrable
harm.
and
that
conceivably
may
also
be
circumstances
in
which
the
magnitude
of
the
unfairness
by
the
government
and
the
harm
to
the
defendant
might
be
sufficiently
substantial
to
constitute
a
due
process
violation
that
would
entitle
a
defendant
to
judicial
relief.
one
situation
might,
for
example
might
be
if
a
defendant
reasonably
relied
on
the
existence
of
an
internal
government
regulation
and
was
then
prejudiced
by
the
government's
unjustified
refusal
to
follow
that
regulation.
another
might
be
if
the
government
agent
decided
not
to
follow
his
agency's
regulations
in
a
particular
case
because
of
some
invidious
reasons
such
as
a
defendant's
race
or
religion.
but
in
our
view,
if
there
are
circumstances
such
as
this
in
which
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
judicial
relief.
the
relief
would
be
based
on
the
due
process
violation
and
not
on
the
violation
of
the
internal
agency
regulation.
due
process,
we
believe,
cannot
be
violated
by
a
mere
agency
violation
of
its
own
rules.
defendant
is
no
worse
off
from
a
violation
of
an
internal
regulation
standing
alone
than
it
would
be
if
the
agency
had
never
adopted
the
internal
regulation
in
the
first
place.
hence,
the
existence
of
and
failure
to
follow
an
internal
agency
regulation
in
our
view
is
that
most
only
of
evidentiary
significance.
but
one
factor
among
many
that
must
be
considered
in
weighing
the
defendant's
due
process
claim.
now,
we've
identified
in
our
brief
a
number
of
the
factors
that
we
believe
must
be
looked
at
to
determine
whether
a
particular
defendant
has
been
deprived
of
due
process.
the
essential
question
of
course
is
whether
the
government's
conduct
is
falling
below
a
standard
of
essential
fairness
that
the
court
should
not
tolerate
it.
it
is
as
the
court
defined
due
process
in
russell
case
whether
the
activity
of
government
law
enforcement
agents
was
repugnant
to
the
american
criminal
justice
system
so
outrageous
that
the
government
should
be
barred
from
invoking
traditional
processes
to
obtain
a
conviction.
we
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
quite
clearly
that
defendant
was
not
treated
unfairly
in
any
way
by
inspector
hill's
failure
to
comply
fully
with
the
authorization
provisions
of
the
irs
manual.
indeed,
respondent
really
makes
no
effort
in
his
brief
to
dispute
that
contention.
for
one
thing,
respondent's
conduct
could
not
have
been
affected
in
anyway
by
inspector
hill's
non-compliance
with
the
irs
regulations.
respondent
didn't
know
that
his
conversations
with
agent
hill
were
being
--
agent
yee's,
excuse
me,
were
being
recorded.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's
not
a
possibility
in
this
case
and
i
hope
to
get
to
in
just
a
moment.
but
even
if
it
were
turned
down,
our
position
would
still
be
that
the
defendant
is
no
worse
off
than
if
the
regulations
hadn't
been
promulgated
in
the
first
place.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
well,
i
think
that
vitarelli
against
seaton
just
like
accardi
against
shaughnessy
and
service
against
dulles,
that
line
of
cases.
we
don't
attack
the
decision
in
those
lines
of
cases.
in
this
case,
those
are
adjudicated
cases
and
i
think
that
the
courts
were
announcing
rules
of
administrative
law
and
not
due
process.
i
think
what
we're
dealing
with
here
in
this
type
of
case
in
the
leahey,
heffner,
sourapas
lines
of
cases
are
judicial
scrutiny
of
internal
government
regulations
in
connection
with
prosecute
or
law
enforcement
decision-making.
and
i
thinking
that
the
one,
the
due
process
standard
that
the
courts
announced
in
overseeing
law
enforcement
techniques
is
much,
much
lower
standard.
the
standard
i
articulated
a
moment
ago
whether
the
government's
conduct
is
so
outrageous
that
the
court
should
not
allow
judicial
processes
to
be
in
foc
--
to
obtain
a
conviction.
we
--
there
are
many
facets
obviously
to
the
question
of,
must
agencies
follow
their
own
rules
and
we're
only
concerned
here
with
the
small
facet
of
the
question
that
involves
criminal
investigative
of
prosecute
of
policies
and
whether
either
the
dismissal
of
criminal
charges
or
the
suppression
of
evidence
in
the
criminal
case
is
an
appropriate
remedy
for
those
types
of
violations.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes
it
was.
now,
respondent
as
i
was
saying
didn't
know
that
his
conversations
with
agent
yee
were
being
recorded
and
he
certainly
didn't
know
that
they
were
being
recorded
without
justice
department
approval.
in
his
incriminating
statements
to
agent
yee
in
the
january
31st
and
the
february
6th
meetings
wouldn't
have
varied
in
any
respect
if
inspector
hill
have
applied
for
and
obtained
monitoring
authority
pursuant
to
the
routine
rather
than
the
emergency
provisions
of
the
irs
manual
as
the
district
court
insisted
he
should
have
done.
and
by
the
same
token,
in
connection
with
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
was
no
prejudice
to
respondent
because
if
the
irs
manual
had
been
fully
complied
with,
it's
absolutely
no
question
on
this
record
that
the
department
of
justice
would
have
authorize
agent
yee
to
record
his
conversations
with
respondent.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
law
enforcement
technique
of
consensual
monitoring
was
only
of
marginal
utility
for
obvious
reasons,
instances
of
attempted
bribery
by
irs
agents.
it
has
always
been
considered
to
be
among
the
most
justified
uses
of
consensual
recording
equipment
under
the
irs
regulations.
indeed,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
assistant
attorney
general
actually
approved
the
monitoring
of
the
february
11th
meeting
in
advance
with
the
knowledge
that
on
two
prior
occasions
earlier
that
week,
the
irs
had
engaged
in
consensual
monitoring
of
respondent's
conversations
pursuant
to
the
emergency
exception
to
the
irs
manual.
in
fact
there
had
been
an
incident
in
march
of
1974
in
which
respondent
also
made
a
statement
to
agent
yee
that
could
have
been
construed
as
a
bribe
offer
and
at
that
time,
agent
yee
also
reported
this
to
the
internal
security
division
which
had
sought
approval
from
the
department
of
justice
to
monitor
face-to-face
conversations
between
agent
yee
and
back
in
march
of
1974,
the
justice
department
had
also
grant
an
approval
and
had
in
fact,
i
think,
extended
that
approval
for
five
consecutive
months
so
there's
no
question
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
justice
department
would
have
granted
approval
pursuant
to
the
irs
manual
and
the
attorney
general's
memorandum.
we
therefore
have
a
situation
here
in
which
the
irs
has
failed
to
comply
precisely
with
its
internal
regulations,
didn't
treat
the
defendant
unfairly
in
any
way,
didn't
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'd
make
the
same
argument
although
if
the
argument
--
if
my
same
argument
would
be
rejected
then
it
would
have
to,
i
soon
reach
the
question
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
we
don't
think
that
you
have
to
even
reach
the
question
of
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
don't
think
that's
what
we
mean
by
prejudice
in
the
due
process
since
because
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there's
no
unfairness
because
as
i've
said
earlier,
we
think
the
inquiry
is
the
defendant
any
worse
off
than
he
would
have
been
if
the
regulations
had
not
been
promulgated
in
the
first
place.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
we
don't
think
there's
been
a
due
process.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
my
broad
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
the
court
need
to
reach
that
in
this
case
because
i
think
our
broader
proposition
is
correct.
we're
dealing
here
now
with
a
regulation.
it
doesn't
provide
any
remedy
for
an
aggrieved
defendant
and
indeed
as
we
show
in
our
opening
and
reply
briefs
wasn't
even
primarily
intended
for
his
benefit.
finally,
there's
no
finding
by
either
court
below
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
irs
agents.
we
submit
that
in
these
circumstances,
there's
no
conceivable
basis
on
which
to
find
that
the
government's
conduct
treated
respondent
unfairly
much
less
deprived
him
of
due
process.
and
that
accordingly,
the
district
court
was
powerless
to
order
the
suppression
of
the
tape
recordings.
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
on
one
more
point
before
my
time
expires.
the
conclusion
of
some
lower
courts
that
the
violation
of
an
agency
regulation
alone
should
entitle
a
defendant
to
the
suppression
of
evidence
with
the
dismissal
of
criminal
charges
is
premised
to
a
large
extent
on
the
notion
that
regardless
of
the
absence
of
harm
to
the
particular
defendant.
relief
must
be
ordered
in
order
to
give
agency
an
incentive
to
follow
their
agency's
rules.
i
think
that
this
notion
is
misguided
for
the
reasons
that
were
stated
by
judge
friendly
in
the
leonard
case
in
524
f.2d.
executive
branch
agencies
has
substantial
incentives
wholly
apart
from
any
penalties
imposed
by
the
courts
to
ensure
their
own
procedures
are
substantially
observed.
executive
branch
agencies,
presumably
adopted
the
particular
procedure
which
were
not,
which
was
not
imposed
by
the
constitution
or
by
statute
because
it
benefited
the
agency
in
some
substantial
significant
way.
the
same
factors
that
cause
the
agency
to
adopt
the
internal
procedures
should
compel
the
agency
and
see
that
they're
obeyed.
even
if
suppression
would
have
some
marginal
deterrent
effect
however
would
be
far
outweighed
in
our
view
by
the
harmful
consequences
that
would
inevitably
be
produced
by
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
inherent
in
the
voluntary
adoption
by
the
executive
branch
of
internal
guidelines
is
the
expectation
that
the
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
those
guidelines
will
be
left
to
the
executive
branch.
if
judicial
sanctions
are
going
to
be
imposed
solely
for
violations
of
voluntarily
adopted
internal
guidelines,
the
wisdom
of
adopting
those
practices
in
the
first
place
would
obviously
have
to
be
reexamined.
therefore,
suppression
would
really
punish
society
twice.
first,
the
probative
evidence
of
criminal
activity
would
be
excluded
and
criminal
prosecutions
would
be
impeded.
and
secondly,
the
government
would
be
dissuaded
from
adopting
a
great
many
beneficial
rules
and
practices
that
go
beyond
what
the
constitution
or
statute
may
require.
thus,
at
the
time
when
the
court
of
appeals
candidly
conceded
there
has
been
a
growing
disenchantment
with
the
exclusionary
rule
we
submit
that
it
would
be
exceedingly
unwise
to
extend
the
remedy
of
suppression
to
the
situation
such
as
this
one
whether
constitution
and
federal
statutes
were
fully
complied
with
and
there
was
at
most
an
inconsequential
violation
of
internal
agency
regulation.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
only
case
that
there's
a
criminal
prosecution
was
the
yellin
case
which
was
a
prosecution
for
criminal
contempt
of
congress.
the
yellin
case
is
in
many
ways
a
peculiar
case
the
court
didn't
really
explain
what
the
source
of
the
power
was.
it
was
exercising
in
reversing
that
conviction
although
there
were
two
threads
that
seem
to
run
through
the
argument.
one
is
that
there
might
have
been
some
reliance
interest
on
the
part
of
mr.
yellin
and
we
agree
that
if
there
has
in
fact
been
reliance
interest
created
by
a
regulation
there
may
well
be
a
due
process
violation
if
that
regulation
is
violated.
and
secondly,
there
was
some
notion
in
yellin
that
it's
not
fair
to
prosecute
someone
for
contempt
of
congress
if
they
are
to
comply
with
the
rules
of
congress
when
congress
itself
hasn't
followed
its
own
rules.
but
the
yellin
case
is
the
only
case
i'm
aware
of
on
which
respondent
relies.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
there
was
--
there
was
--
the
court
did
refer
to
that
of
course
just
repeat
vitarelli
like
service
against
dulles
and
accardi
were
admitted
adjudicative
cases,
administrative
law
cases
and
of
course
even
in
that
context,
there
has
to
be
some
finding
that
a
particular
regular
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
person
who
seeks
to
challenged
its
violation
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
referring
to
in
vitarelli.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
accardi
and
in
service
against
dulles.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
precisely
and
of
course
in
those
cases,
all
that
happen,
all
that
the
court
ordered
was
a
remand
for
a
new
hearing
at
which
these
procedures
would
be
complied
with
here
of
course
the
remedy
ordered
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
i
believe
the
court
also
mentioned
that
this
would
not
preclude
the
government
from
immediately
discharging
vitarelli
and
the
proper
procedures.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
presents
the
question
whether
a
district
court
may
properly
suppress
probative
and
otherwise
admissible
evidence
of
a
crime
merely
because
the
government
agency
failed
to
follow
internal
regulations
that
imposed
duties
upon
it
not
required
either
by
the
constitution
or
by
statute.
we
contend
that
suppression
is
inappropriate
remedy
in
such
circumstances;
especially
where
as
in
this
case,
the
agency
regulation
at
issue
was
not
intended
to
grant
enforceable
rights
to
individual
defendants.
the
violation
of
the
regulation
was
isolated
and
was
not
committed
in
bad
faith
and
the
defendant
has
been
unable
to
demonstrate
any
prejudice
as
a
result
of
the
violation.
the
facts
of
this
case
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
in
january
1975,
agent
robert
yee
of
the
internal
revenue
service
was
ordered
in
respondent's
individual
and
unemployment
tax
returns
for
the
year
1971.
at
the
conclusion
of
a
meeting
between
respondent
and
agent
yee
on
january
27,
1975,
respondent
proposed
the
so-called
personal
settlement
of
his
tax
difficulties.
he
offered
agent
yee
a
$1,000.00
if
the
agent
would
reduce
his
estimated
tax
liabilities
by
about
one-third.
agent
yee
immediately
reported
this
bribe
offer
to
inspector
hill
of
the
irs
internal
security
division.
at
hill's
direction,
agent
yee
called
respondent
on
january
the
30th
and
arranged
the
meeting
for
the
following
day
at
respondent's
office.
during
this
meeting,
respondent
gave
agent
yee
a
partial
payment
of
$500.00
for
settling
the
tax
audit
as
respondent
had
earlier
suggested.
unbeknownst
to
respondent,
this
conversation
was
recorded
by
agent
yee
by
means
of
a
tape
recorder
concealed
on
the
agent's
person.
agent
yee
also
met
with
respondent
on
february
the
6th
and
february
the
11th
1975.
at
the
february
6th
meeting,
respondent
offered
agent
yee,
an
additional
$2,000.00
to
audit
his
1973
and
1974
individual
income
tax
returns
to
respondent's
satisfaction.
and
on
february
11th,
respondent
gave
agent
yee
$500.00
as
the
second
installment
for
the
favorable
termination
of
the
1971
audit.
the
february
6th
and
february
11th
meetings
were
also
secretly
recorded
by
agent
yee.
the
respondent
was
subsequently
indicted
on
three
counts
of
bribery
prior
to
the
second
trial
on
these
charges.
he
moved
to
suppress
the
three
tape
recordings
on
the
ground
that
they
have
not
been
properly
authorized
under
the
applicable
irs
internal
regulations
governing
consensual
monitoring
of
face-to-face
conversations
between
agents
and
taxpayers.
those
regulations
require
that
except
in
exigent
circumstances
advanced
approval
for
such
monitoring,
must
be
obtained
by
the
director
of
the
irs
internal
security
division
from
appropriate
officials
in
the
department
of
justice.
the
irs
man
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there's
a
--
the
regulation
also
applies
to
telephone
monitoring
but
there
are
there
are
different
authorization
requirements
there
and
they're
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
approval
of
the
department
of
justice
is
not
required
for
telephone,
consensual
telephone
monitoring,
only
for
consensual
face-to-face
monitoring
of
conversations.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
sparse
history
that's
available
to
explain
the
reasons
for
the
adoption
of
these
regulations
does
suggest,
yes,
that
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
attorney
general
thought
it
was
marginally
more
intrusive
of
possible
privacy
rights
to
have
face-to-face
conversations
recorded
than
telephone
conversations.
the
theory
being
that
conversations
over
telephone
are
going
through
wires,
through
offices,
and
circuits
and
there's
just
less
reasonable
of
an
expectation
that
they're
not
being
overheard.
of
course,
consensual
monitoring
either
by
telephone
or
by
face-to-face
regulations
as
i'll
get
to
face-to-face
conversations
doesn't
implicate
the
either
fourth
amendment
or
any
statute.
and
the
irs
manual
also
provides
that
when
exigent
circumstances
are
present,
emergency
authorization
for
consensual
monitoring
may
be
given
by
the
director
of
the
irs
internal
security
division
acting
alone.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case,
show
that
on
either
january
the
30th
or
january
the
31st
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's
a
judgment
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
the
exigent
circumstances
that
the
regulations
refer
to
are
merely
matter
of
time
that's
involved
before
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
definition
and
interpretation
of
an
internal
regulation
promulgated
by
an
agency
should
be
for
that
agency
and
that
agency
alone.
now
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
found
that
the
emergency
provisions
of
the
irs
manual
were
violated.
while
we
disagree
with
that
conclusion,
we
haven't
challenged
it
in
this
court.
and
this
court,
this
case
reaches
this
court
on
the
assumption
that
the
regulations
were
in
fact
violated.
the
question
is
merely
what
the
remedy
should
be.
now,
as
i
was
saying
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
after
agent
yee
had
arranged
the
january
31st
meeting
with
respondent,
but
before
that
meeting
took
place,
inspector
hill
applied
for
authorization
to
monitor
the
conversations
between
respondent
and
agent
yee.
the
request
was
transmitted
to
the
irs
national
office
here
in
washington
on
january
31st
but
other
county
was
not
forwarded
to
the
justice
department
until
february
the
7th.
as
a
result
of
this
delay,
the
director
of
the
irs
internal
security
division
acting
pursuant
to
the
exigent
circumstances
provision
of
the
irs
manual
gave
emergency
approval
to
record
the
january
31st
and
february
6th
conversations
between
respondent
and
agent
yee.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
hesitate
to
answer
that
question.
in
the
abstract,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
properly
both
that
the
statutory
issue
should
be
resolved
before
the
constitutional
one.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
have
not
challenged
in
this
court
that
the
regulation
was
violated.
i'm
not
aware
what
standards
the
court
would
bring
to
resolve
any
question
like
that
if
the
agency
itself
says
that
the
regulation
hasn't
violated
but
that's
part
and
parcel
of
the
larger
argument
that
we
make
here
today
that
an
agency
regulation,
the
violation
of
a
regulation
standing
alone
does
not
give
anyone
any
legal
rights
that
are
enforceable
to
court.
it's
our
position
which
i
hope
to
elaborate
on
later
the
argument.
but
only
if
the
defendant
is
worse
off
by
the
promulgation
and
violation
of
an
agency
regulation
then
he
would
be
if
the
agency
had
not
promulgated
the
regulation
at
all,
might
it
be
appropriate
for
the
court
in
construing
the
due
process
clause
to
grant
some
form
of
relief.
now
the
justice
department
eventually
approved
the
irs
consensual
monitoring
request
on
february
the
10th
and
therefore
the
recording
of
the
february
11th
meeting
was
fully
authorized
in
advance.
in
full
compliance
with
the
irs
manual
and
it's
not
an
issue
here.
based
on
this
evidence
the
district
court
granted
respondent's
motion
to
suppress
the
recordings
of
the
january
31st
and
february
6th
meetings,
the
court
found
that
no
true
exigency
existed
and
that
irs
agent
said
therefore
violated
the
procedures
in
the
irs
manual
by
not
obtaining
approval
from
the
department
of
justice.
the
government
appealed
the
suppression
ruling
but
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
i
think
it's
important
to
begin
on
discussion
of
this
case
by
asking
a
critical
question
that
court
of
appeals
never
attempted
to
answer
and
that
is,
what
is
the
source
of
the
district
court's
power
to
suppress
the
highly
probative
tape
recordings
of
respondent's
conversations
with
agent
yee
merely
because
of
the
violation
of
an
internal
government
regulation?
first,
there
are
several
--
few
answers
to
these
questions
seem
reasonably
clear.
first,
the
power
can't
be
found
in
the
regulation
itself.
the
irs
manual
doesn't
contain
an
exclusionary
rule
and
indeed
it
specifically
provides
for
the
wholly
separate
remedy
of
disciplinary
action
in
appropriate
cases
against
irs
agents
who
violate
the
manual.
it's
also
clear
that
the
authority
to
suppress
can't
be
found
in
the
fourth
amendment
or
in
any
federal
statute.
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
vacations
that
consensual
recording
of
face-to-face
conversations
does
not
constitute
a
search
or
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
title
iii
also
specifically
excludes
consensual
recordings
by
law
enforcement
officers
from
its
provisions.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
purport
to
be
ordering
the
suppression
of
evidence
here
as
an
exercise
of
its
supervisory
powers.
and
hence,
whatever
the
legitimacy
of
the
court
ever
using
its
supervisory
powers
to
exclude
probative
evidence
in
a
criminal
case
because
of
an
agency's
violation
of
its
own
rules
we
have
substantial
data
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
that
case
we
still
think
it
would
be
up
to
the
agency
itself
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
seek
enforcement
of
hat
provision
as
in
fact
it
does
in
the
petite
--
as
the
department
of
justice
does
in
petite
policy
cases.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
or
whether
or
not
to
in
effect
pro
tanto
repeal
that
provision
we
think
the
courts
cannot
step
unless
unconstitutional
or
statutory
right
of
the
defendant
has
been
violated.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
gather,
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
see
the
district
court
would
have
supervisory
power
presumably
the
argument
would
go
would
have
supervisory
powers
over
an
agency
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
determine
whether
the
district
court
has
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
want
to
be
put
in
the
position
of
defending
supervisory
powers
of
courts
over
executive
branch
agencies
because
the
position
of
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
took
the
position
in
the
jacobs
case
last
year
that
district
courts
don't
have
any
broad
undefined
supervisory
powers
and
that's
still
the
position
of
the
justice
department.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
although
in
the
jacobs'
case,
there
was
a
question
of
how
united
states
attorney
or
strike
force
attorney
should
act
in
a
particular
situation.
well,
that
leaves
us
with
the
claim
that
respondent
urges
most
strongly
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
accepted
which
is
that
the
power
to
exclude
the
tape
recordings
flows
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
as
we
understand
respondent's
argument,
he
says
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process,
every
agency
must
promulgate
internal
regulations
restricting
the
unfettered
discretion
of
its
employees.
every
agent,
every
employee
must
abide
by
the
regulations
of
his
agency.
in
every
violation
of
an
internal
regulation
constitutes
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
key
assertion
is
obviously
the
last
one
that
is
that
any
time
an
agency
fails
to
comply
with
one
of
its
mandatory
guidelines.
the
person
with
whom
the
agency
is
dealing
has
been
denied
due
process.
the
respondent
relies
for
this
assertion
solely
upon
cases
such
as
accardi
against
shaughnessy
and
service
against
dulles.
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
last
term
in
board
of
curators
against
horowitz,
that
line
of
cases
merely
announces
a
rule
of
federal
administrative
law
not
a
principle
of
constitutional
law
applicable
in
non-adjudicated
context.
and
these
decisions
certainly
didn't
equate
every
violation
of
an
agency's
regulation
whether
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
indeed,
sullivan
against
the
united
states
in
348
u.s.
was
decided
only
a
few
months
after
accardi.
yet
the
court
failed
to
mention
accardi
in
denying
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
an
indictment
in
that
case
because
of
the
violation
of
an
internal
agency
procedure.
i
should
make
clear
that
we
certainly
don't
dispute
that
there
may
be
circumstances
where
the
government's
failure
to
follow
procedures
outlined
in
its
internal
regulations
might
operate
to
treat
a
particular
defendant
unfairly.
it
might
cause
the
defendant
demonstrable
harm.
and
that
conceivably
may
also
be
circumstances
in
which
the
magnitude
of
the
unfairness
by
the
government
and
the
harm
to
the
defendant
might
be
sufficiently
substantial
to
constitute
a
due
process
violation
that
would
entitle
a
defendant
to
judicial
relief.
one
situation
might,
for
example
might
be
if
a
defendant
reasonably
relied
on
the
existence
of
an
internal
government
regulation
and
was
then
prejudiced
by
the
government's
unjustified
refusal
to
follow
that
regulation.
another
might
be
if
the
government
agent
decided
not
to
follow
his
agency's
regulations
in
a
particular
case
because
of
some
invidious
reasons
such
as
a
defendant's
race
or
religion.
but
in
our
view,
if
there
are
circumstances
such
as
this
in
which
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
judicial
relief.
the
relief
would
be
based
on
the
due
process
violation
and
not
on
the
violation
of
the
internal
agency
regulation.
due
process,
we
believe,
cannot
be
violated
by
a
mere
agency
violation
of
its
own
rules.
defendant
is
no
worse
off
from
a
violation
of
an
internal
regulation
standing
alone
than
it
would
be
if
the
agency
had
never
adopted
the
internal
regulation
in
the
first
place.
hence,
the
existence
of
and
failure
to
follow
an
internal
agency
regulation
in
our
view
is
that
most
only
of
evidentiary
significance.
but
one
factor
among
many
that
must
be
considered
in
weighing
the
defendant's
due
process
claim.
now,
we've
identified
in
our
brief
a
number
of
the
factors
that
we
believe
must
be
looked
at
to
determine
whether
a
particular
defendant
has
been
deprived
of
due
process.
the
essential
question
of
course
is
whether
the
government's
conduct
is
falling
below
a
standard
of
essential
fairness
that
the
court
should
not
tolerate
it.
it
is
as
the
court
defined
due
process
in
russell
case
whether
the
activity
of
government
law
enforcement
agents
was
repugnant
to
the
american
criminal
justice
system
so
outrageous
that
the
government
should
be
barred
from
invoking
traditional
processes
to
obtain
a
conviction.
we
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
quite
clearly
that
defendant
was
not
treated
unfairly
in
any
way
by
inspector
hill's
failure
to
comply
fully
with
the
authorization
provisions
of
the
irs
manual.
indeed,
respondent
really
makes
no
effort
in
his
brief
to
dispute
that
contention.
for
one
thing,
respondent's
conduct
could
not
have
been
affected
in
anyway
by
inspector
hill's
non-compliance
with
the
irs
regulations.
respondent
didn't
know
that
his
conversations
with
agent
hill
were
being
--
agent
yee's,
excuse
me,
were
being
recorded.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's
not
a
possibility
in
this
case
and
i
hope
to
get
to
in
just
a
moment.
but
even
if
it
were
turned
down,
our
position
would
still
be
that
the
defendant
is
no
worse
off
than
if
the
regulations
hadn't
been
promulgated
in
the
first
place.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
well,
i
think
that
vitarelli
against
seaton
just
like
accardi
against
shaughnessy
and
service
against
dulles,
that
line
of
cases.
we
don't
attack
the
decision
in
those
lines
of
cases.
in
this
case,
those
are
adjudicated
cases
and
i
think
that
the
courts
were
announcing
rules
of
administrative
law
and
not
due
process.
i
think
what
we're
dealing
with
here
in
this
type
of
case
in
the
leahey,
heffner,
sourapas
lines
of
cases
are
judicial
scrutiny
of
internal
government
regulations
in
connection
with
prosecute
or
law
enforcement
decision-making.
and
i
thinking
that
the
one,
the
due
process
standard
that
the
courts
announced
in
overseeing
law
enforcement
techniques
is
much,
much
lower
standard.
the
standard
i
articulated
a
moment
ago
whether
the
government's
conduct
is
so
outrageous
that
the
court
should
not
allow
judicial
processes
to
be
in
foc
--
to
obtain
a
conviction.
we
--
there
are
many
facets
obviously
to
the
question
of,
must
agencies
follow
their
own
rules
and
we're
only
concerned
here
with
the
small
facet
of
the
question
that
involves
criminal
investigative
of
prosecute
of
policies
and
whether
either
the
dismissal
of
criminal
charges
or
the
suppression
of
evidence
in
the
criminal
case
is
an
appropriate
remedy
for
those
types
of
violations.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes
it
was.
now,
respondent
as
i
was
saying
didn't
know
that
his
conversations
with
agent
yee
were
being
recorded
and
he
certainly
didn't
know
that
they
were
being
recorded
without
justice
department
approval.
in
his
incriminating
statements
to
agent
yee
in
the
january
31st
and
the
february
6th
meetings
wouldn't
have
varied
in
any
respect
if
inspector
hill
have
applied
for
and
obtained
monitoring
authority
pursuant
to
the
routine
rather
than
the
emergency
provisions
of
the
irs
manual
as
the
district
court
insisted
he
should
have
done.
and
by
the
same
token,
in
connection
with
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
was
no
prejudice
to
respondent
because
if
the
irs
manual
had
been
fully
complied
with,
it's
absolutely
no
question
on
this
record
that
the
department
of
justice
would
have
authorize
agent
yee
to
record
his
conversations
with
respondent.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
law
enforcement
technique
of
consensual
monitoring
was
only
of
marginal
utility
for
obvious
reasons,
instances
of
attempted
bribery
by
irs
agents.
it
has
always
been
considered
to
be
among
the
most
justified
uses
of
consensual
recording
equipment
under
the
irs
regulations.
indeed,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
assistant
attorney
general
actually
approved
the
monitoring
of
the
february
11th
meeting
in
advance
with
the
knowledge
that
on
two
prior
occasions
earlier
that
week,
the
irs
had
engaged
in
consensual
monitoring
of
respondent's
conversations
pursuant
to
the
emergency
exception
to
the
irs
manual.
in
fact
there
had
been
an
incident
in
march
of
1974
in
which
respondent
also
made
a
statement
to
agent
yee
that
could
have
been
construed
as
a
bribe
offer
and
at
that
time,
agent
yee
also
reported
this
to
the
internal
security
division
which
had
sought
approval
from
the
department
of
justice
to
monitor
face-to-face
conversations
between
agent
yee
and
back
in
march
of
1974,
the
justice
department
had
also
grant
an
approval
and
had
in
fact,
i
think,
extended
that
approval
for
five
consecutive
months
so
there's
no
question
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
justice
department
would
have
granted
approval
pursuant
to
the
irs
manual
and
the
attorney
general's
memorandum.
we
therefore
have
a
situation
here
in
which
the
irs
has
failed
to
comply
precisely
with
its
internal
regulations,
didn't
treat
the
defendant
unfairly
in
any
way,
didn't
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'd
make
the
same
argument
although
if
the
argument
--
if
my
same
argument
would
be
rejected
then
it
would
have
to,
i
soon
reach
the
question
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
we
don't
think
that
you
have
to
even
reach
the
question
of
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
don't
think
that's
what
we
mean
by
prejudice
in
the
due
process
since
because
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there's
no
unfairness
because
as
i've
said
earlier,
we
think
the
inquiry
is
the
defendant
any
worse
off
than
he
would
have
been
if
the
regulations
had
not
been
promulgated
in
the
first
place.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
we
don't
think
there's
been
a
due
process.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
my
broad
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
the
court
need
to
reach
that
in
this
case
because
i
think
our
broader
proposition
is
correct.
we're
dealing
here
now
with
a
regulation.
it
doesn't
provide
any
remedy
for
an
aggrieved
defendant
and
indeed
as
we
show
in
our
opening
and
reply
briefs
wasn't
even
primarily
intended
for
his
benefit.
finally,
there's
no
finding
by
either
court
below
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
irs
agents.
we
submit
that
in
these
circumstances,
there's
no
conceivable
basis
on
which
to
find
that
the
government's
conduct
treated
respondent
unfairly
much
less
deprived
him
of
due
process.
and
that
accordingly,
the
district
court
was
powerless
to
order
the
suppression
of
the
tape
recordings.
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
on
one
more
point
before
my
time
expires.
the
conclusion
of
some
lower
courts
that
the
violation
of
an
agency
regulation
alone
should
entitle
a
defendant
to
the
suppression
of
evidence
with
the
dismissal
of
criminal
charges
is
premised
to
a
large
extent
on
the
notion
that
regardless
of
the
absence
of
harm
to
the
particular
defendant.
relief
must
be
ordered
in
order
to
give
agency
an
incentive
to
follow
their
agency's
rules.
i
think
that
this
notion
is
misguided
for
the
reasons
that
were
stated
by
judge
friendly
in
the
leonard
case
in
524
f.2d.
executive
branch
agencies
has
substantial
incentives
wholly
apart
from
any
penalties
imposed
by
the
courts
to
ensure
their
own
procedures
are
substantially
observed.
executive
branch
agencies,
presumably
adopted
the
particular
procedure
which
were
not,
which
was
not
imposed
by
the
constitution
or
by
statute
because
it
benefited
the
agency
in
some
substantial
significant
way.
the
same
factors
that
cause
the
agency
to
adopt
the
internal
procedures
should
compel
the
agency
and
see
that
they're
obeyed.
even
if
suppression
would
have
some
marginal
deterrent
effect
however
would
be
far
outweighed
in
our
view
by
the
harmful
consequences
that
would
inevitably
be
produced
by
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
inherent
in
the
voluntary
adoption
by
the
executive
branch
of
internal
guidelines
is
the
expectation
that
the
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
those
guidelines
will
be
left
to
the
executive
branch.
if
judicial
sanctions
are
going
to
be
imposed
solely
for
violations
of
voluntarily
adopted
internal
guidelines,
the
wisdom
of
adopting
those
practices
in
the
first
place
would
obviously
have
to
be
reexamined.
therefore,
suppression
would
really
punish
society
twice.
first,
the
probative
evidence
of
criminal
activity
would
be
excluded
and
criminal
prosecutions
would
be
impeded.
and
secondly,
the
government
would
be
dissuaded
from
adopting
a
great
many
beneficial
rules
and
practices
that
go
beyond
what
the
constitution
or
statute
may
require.
thus,
at
the
time
when
the
court
of
appeals
candidly
conceded
there
has
been
a
growing
disenchantment
with
the
exclusionary
rule
we
submit
that
it
would
be
exceedingly
unwise
to
extend
the
remedy
of
suppression
to
the
situation
such
as
this
one
whether
constitution
and
federal
statutes
were
fully
complied
with
and
there
was
at
most
an
inconsequential
violation
of
internal
agency
regulation.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
only
case
that
there's
a
criminal
prosecution
was
the
yellin
case
which
was
a
prosecution
for
criminal
contempt
of
congress.
the
yellin
case
is
in
many
ways
a
peculiar
case
the
court
didn't
really
explain
what
the
source
of
the
power
was.
it
was
exercising
in
reversing
that
conviction
although
there
were
two
threads
that
seem
to
run
through
the
argument.
one
is
that
there
might
have
been
some
reliance
interest
on
the
part
of
mr.
yellin
and
we
agree
that
if
there
has
in
fact
been
reliance
interest
created
by
a
regulation
there
may
well
be
a
due
process
violation
if
that
regulation
is
violated.
and
secondly,
there
was
some
notion
in
yellin
that
it's
not
fair
to
prosecute
someone
for
contempt
of
congress
if
they
are
to
comply
with
the
rules
of
congress
when
congress
itself
hasn't
followed
its
own
rules.
but
the
yellin
case
is
the
only
case
i'm
aware
of
on
which
respondent
relies.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
there
was
--
there
was
--
the
court
did
refer
to
that
of
course
just
repeat
vitarelli
like
service
against
dulles
and
accardi
were
admitted
adjudicative
cases,
administrative
law
cases
and
of
course
even
in
that
context,
there
has
to
be
some
finding
that
a
particular
regular
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
person
who
seeks
to
challenged
its
violation
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
referring
to
in
vitarelli.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
accardi
and
in
service
against
dulles.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
precisely
and
of
course
in
those
cases,
all
that
happen,
all
that
the
court
ordered
was
a
remand
for
a
new
hearing
at
which
these
procedures
would
be
complied
with
here
of
course
the
remedy
ordered
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
i
believe
the
court
also
mentioned
that
this
would
not
preclude
the
government
from
immediately
discharging
vitarelli
and
the
proper
procedures.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
thank
you.
