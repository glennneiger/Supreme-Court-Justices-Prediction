justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
let
me
go
back
a
moment
to
follow
up
my
question
that
chief
justice
asked
you
a
moment
ago.
supposing
that
in
a
lower
court
case
a
statutory
issue
and
a
constitutional
issue
are
both
decided
against
the
government.
the
government
decides
to
seek
certiorari
but
seeks
certiorari
only
on
the
constitutional
issue.
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
proper
attack
for
the
(inaudible)
office
to
take?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
feel
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
in
this
particular
case,
the
agency
regulation
was
violated
and
the
more
general
question
of
whether
or
not
what
the
remedy
should
be
conceding
as
violated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
supervisory
powers
of
the
court,
do
you
mean
over
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
as
the
court's
views
as
a
supervisory
power
of
an
agency
created
by
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
district
court
get
any
supervisory
power
unspecified
by
congress
over
an
agency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
good
for
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
even
the
defendant's
in
the
jacobs
case
were
just
arguing
that
supervisory
powers
in
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals
extends
to
what
shall
be
admitted
as
evidence
in
the
district
court,
might
they?
