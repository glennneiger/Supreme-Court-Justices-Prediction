justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
could
i
interrupt
just
two
thoughts?
one,
you
say
it
couldn't
have
been
heard.
maybe
he
would
have
turned
down
if
he
followed
the
procedure
and
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
monitoring,
isn't
that
a
possibility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
in
that
point
before
you
get
through.
you
make
some
comments
in
vitarelli
against
seaton
where
the
man
was
discharged
he
would
have
been
no
worse
off
if
they
didn't
have
all
these
procedures
just
to
get
him
terminated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
on
that
point
about
certainty
of
approval,
supposing
we
had
a
case
in
which
it
somewhat
uncertain.
whether
they
would
have
approved
it,
would
you
make
a
different
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
would
always
be
prejudice
i
suppose
if
they
got
some
recordings
that
they
would
not
otherwise
have
gotten
and
they
were
material
to
the
material
level.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
mean
there's
no
unfairness,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
your
position
--
i
just
want
to
get
it
straight
in
my
mind.
your
position
really
is
that
that
even
if
he
would
have
been
worse
off,
the
violation
of
department
regulation
of
this
kind
shouldn't
justify
the
application
in
exclusionary
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's
your
broad
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
decide
each
case
on
whether
we
think
they
might
or
might
not
have
gotten
approval
otherwise,
it's
kind
of
--
kind
of
a
tough
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
no,
that's
not
right
in
vitarelli.
he
ordered
--
the
court
ordered
reinstatement
in
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
procedures
are
totally
unnecessary
for
the
employee
or
just
when
they
charge
him
with
the
particular
violation,
they
may
come
in
a
sympathy
and
the
like.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
none
of
those
statements
said
anything
about
asking
for
court
help
and
enforcing
the
regulation
or
in
disciplining
people
who
violated
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
attorney

did
not
or
did
it?

the

justice
john
paul

of
remedy
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
internal
revenue
service
regulations
may
be
admitted
at
the
criminal
trial
of
a
taxpayer
accused
of
bribing
an
internal
revenue
service
agent.
the
internal
revenue
service
manual
contains
detailed
procedures
that
must
be
followed
before
conversations
between
an
agent
and
a
taxpayer
may
be
recorded
electronically
without
the
taxpayer's
knowledge.
in
this
case,
after
an
irs
agent
had
been
offered
a
bribe
by
the
respondent,
he
reported
the
matter
to
his
immediate
supervisor
who
thereafter
directed
him
to
record
secretly
certain
future
conversations
with
respondent.
although
an
attempt
was
made
to
secure
all
of
the
approvals
required
by
the
regulations,
there
was
a
failure
to
obtain
authorization
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
accordingly,
in
the
bribery
prosecution
which
the
government
instituted
in
the
district
court,
responded
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
tape
recorded
conversations.
the
district
court
held
that
the
conversations
had
been
obtained
in
violation
of
a
valid
regulation
and
therefore
should
be
suppressed.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
although
we
accept
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
recordings
were
obtained
in
violation
of
agency
regulations.
we
hold
that
there
was
no
violation
of
any
of
respondent's
constitutional
or
statutory
rights.
we
reject
respondent's
contention
that
exclusion
is
always
an
appropriate
remedy
whenever
evidence
is
obtained
in
violation
of
a
valid
regulation.
and
further
hold
that
the
circumstances
involved
in
this
case
do
not
justify
the
suppression
remedy.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
