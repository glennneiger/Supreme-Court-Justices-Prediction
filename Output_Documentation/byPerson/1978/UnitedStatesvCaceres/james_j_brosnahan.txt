mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
no.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
looks
like
i
might
make
coffee
with
it,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
see
the
case
before
you
differently
and
i'd
like
to
state
what
we
think
the
issue
is.
in
the
case
where
there
is
a
mandatory
published
regulation
by
agencies
of
the
federal
government
which
has
been
approved
on
a
nationwide
basis
for
the
protection
of
fundamental
interest
of
citizens.
where
that
regulation
is
violated,
where
that
violation
is
delivered,
and
where
the
evidence
obtained
after
the
violation
is
sought
to
be
introduced
in
a
federal
district
court
in
a
criminal
case.
should
that
evidence
be
suppressed
because
as
we
alleged
it
will
deter
a
federal
agents
from
committing
future
violation.
there's
been
a
lot
of
briefing
in
the
case
and
i
thought
i
would
start
by
stating
what
we
think
the
issue
is
and
then
saying
at
the
outset
that
we
believe
that
we
can
support
each
element
of
that
standard
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
mr.
chief
justice,
only
in
this
sense
that
as
a
citizen,
one
of
many,
one
of
millions
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
to
the
court
to
those
are
mental
state
in
the
doctor's
mind
that
he
focused
on
as
clearly
he
didn't
but
there
are
many
other
cases
where
clearly
it
was
true
too.
but
as
a
general
sense
of
a
citizen
from
1965,
he
had
the
right
to
believe
that
no
one
would
ever
electronically
record
or
transmit
what
he
was
saying
even
to
a
federal
agent
unless
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
somebody
designated
by
the
attorney
general
had
approved
it
before.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
we
say,
first
there's
been
no
conviction
of
course.
there
was
a
hang
jury
and
no
jury
has
ever
found
dr.
caceres
guilty
and
he's
presumed
innocent.
but
aside
from
that,
we
believe
that
from
at
least
1967,
every
one
in
the
country
including
the
attorney
general
and
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
service
and
other
high
officials
responsible
for
the
passage
of
this
regulation
had
the
right
to
assume
that
there
would
be
no
such
electronic
surveillance.
and
dr.
caceres
is
one
of
many
that
would
be
in
that
state
of
mind.
i
also
would
say
at
the
outset
that
it
seems
to
me
troublesome
that
the
gove
--
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
we
will
--
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
well,
he
would
not
know
that.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
precisely
because
the
type
of
instrument
being
used
is
secretive.
the
fact
that
he
would
never
know
it
is
a
greater
reason
for
insisting
on
the
projection
of
prior
approval.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
well,
--
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
i
think
--
i
think
what
i
was
about
to
say
justice
marshall
is
this.
the
government
argues
in
this
case
that
to
succeed
the
defendant
must
show
personal
reliance
and
harm.
that
to
me
is
an
inconsistent
way
to
go
out
--
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
no.
well,
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
regulatory
scheme
and
i
think
this
is
responsive
to
your
question.
the
regulatory
scheme
is
set
up
in
such
a
way
that
surreptitious
monitoring
which
no
one
knows
is
going
on
except
the
agents
who
are
doing
it,
by
its
very
nature,
will
not
occur
unless
the
attorney
general
or
someone
designated
has
previously
approved
it.
and
dr.
caceres
or
myself
or
any
person
have
the
right
to
go
through
the
country
and
talk
to
a
federal
agent
and
believe
that
there
would
be
no
monitoring
unless
that
approval
is
obtained.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
we
know
that.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
because
--
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
well,
because
if
the
approval
is
not
obtained
--
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
well,
i
would
say
based
on
the
audit
that
was
done
in
1974
and
based
on
what's
shown
in
this
case
and
particularly
if
this
court
would
hold
if
its
alright
to
used
it
in
a
criminal
case
that
the
public's
perception
whether
that
regulation
is
worth
protection
or
not
would
be
that
if
you
can't
rely
on
it
and
you
are
not
going
to
know
when
you're
--
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
yes.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
i
would
say
for
this
reason.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
alright.
i
would
say
for
this
reason.
by
the
very
nature
that
it's
the
attorney
general,
the
regulatory
scheme
when
it
was
passed
imagined
that
the
high
official
would
exercise
very
careful
discussion.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
or
his
designee
and
that
was
the
--
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
i've
always
used
those
terms
together
because
that's
what
it
said
from
the
beginning
and
it
was
for
a
long
time
the
deputy
attorney
general
is
only
the
number
two
person
in
the
department
that
could
do
it
if
he
attorney
general
didn't
do
it.
we
argue
from
that
in
the
legislative
history
and
i
defer
in
my
point
of
view
fro
my
colleague
mr.
geller
on
this
is
not
sparse.
the
record
that
we
have
shown
shows
that
the
president
of
the
united
states,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
all
said
that
from
1965
on
there
would
be
a
high
official
that
would
review
this
kind
of
electronic
surveillance.
and
that
was
because
it
would
be
approved
in
limited
cases
and
attorney
general
levi
and
i
think
this
is
helpful,
in
1960
and
1975,
i
went
to
congress,
delivered
the
statement
which
is
in
our
appendix
dealing
primarily
with
foreign
problems.
but
in
that
the
attorney
general
said
and
surely
believed
it
that
these
regulations
were
such
that
great
time
was
taken
by
his
office
to
review
it
to
ensure
that
there
would
be
no
violation
of
private
rights
that
it
was
always
done
in
advance
and
that
the
congress
couldn't
rely
on
that.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
1975,
i
misspoke.
1975.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
in
1965
it
was
started
and
when
it
was
started
it
was
traumatic
and
i
must
say
that
i
disagree
with
the
government's
view
of
this.
it
was
discussed
at
the
presidential
level.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
it
was
handed
down
and
in
the
white
case
in
the
appendix
there
is
a
quotation
from
president
johnson
in
which
he
said
that
he
would
see
to
it,
he
asked
if
the
agencies
look
at
this
because
it
involved
very
important
rights.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
actually,
the
statement
by
commissioner
cohen
attached
to
the
government's
reply
brief
did
refer
at
least
in
passing
to
suppression
of
evidence.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
he
did
not
address
the
question
of
suppression.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
that
we
say
is
for
this
court
and
for
the
court's
to
deal
with.
mr.
james
j.
brosnahan
thank
you.
mr.
