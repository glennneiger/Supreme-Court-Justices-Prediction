justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
does
the
--
in
your
state
what
is
the
reviewing
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
when
a
convicted
criminal
appeals
and
says
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
is
this
to
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
what
standard
does
the
appellate
court
use
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
this
between
in
the
ordinary
criminal
case
in
virginia,
no
constitutional
issues
involved
in
it,
they're
just
conviction
and
a
claim
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
i
suppose
that
the
standard
in
virginia,
they
instruct
the
jury
that
they
must
find
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
reviewing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
what
does
the
--
you
say
the
virginia
appellate
court
simply
say
is
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
clearly
erroneous?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
decision
of
the
jury
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
clearly
erroneous
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
what
mr.
attorney
general,
of
course
the
federal
habeas
statue
requires
that
all
issues
presented
to
federal
habeas
court
be
exhausted
in
the
state
courts
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
i
suppose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
logical
end
of
you
position
is
that
not
only
pro
tanto
repeal
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
but
let's
just
repeal
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
every
question
if
--
every
question
that
comes
to
a
federal
habeas
court
shouldn't
be
adjudicated
there
at
all
unless
its
--
the
state
courts
have
already
adjudicated
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
been
completely
exhaustion,
so
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
end
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
are
you
suggesting
that
if
all
the
--
if
all
the
plaintiff
does
in
a
--
if
all
the
petitioner
does
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
is
to
claim
the
state
court
made
a
mistake,
i
got
a
good
hearing
and
they
applied
the
right
rules,
the
only
thing
is
they
came
to
the
wrong
result.
if
that's
all
he
says
should
he
be
dismissed
automatically?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
voluntariness
of
a
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
say
it's
been
raised
absolutely
correctly
and
it's
been
adjudicated.
the
rules
have
all
been
followed
in
the
in
the
state
court,
the
only
thing
is
the
petitioner
comes
into
federal
habeas
and
saying
the
state
court
applied
the
right
rules
but
it
just
misjudged
the
facts.
