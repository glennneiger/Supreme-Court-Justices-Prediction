you're
relying
on
the
winship
case,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question,
i
suppose,
is
whether
the
winship
case
is
a
constitutional
matter
beyond
--
requires
that
there
be
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
in
order
to
supply
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
conviction
that
is
for
in
a
state
court,
or
only
that
the
jury
be
instructed
that
they
must
find
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
that's
the
real
question,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
jury
was
so
instructed
in
this
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
maybe,
arguably
that's
all
that
winship
requires.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
the
--
presumably
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
trier
of
fact
followed
that
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
generally
reviewing
courts
in
states
had
very
clearly
do
accept
winship,
as
you
say
virginia
has
not.
that's
not
the
test
in
the
appellate
court,
not
whether
or
not
the
members
of
the
appellate
court
are
convinced
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
only
whether
they
can
say
that
a
rational
jury
could've
so
found.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
test.
justice
potter
stewart
fact
finder.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
in
federal
habeas
corpus,
the
wrong
standard
was
applied,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
was
i
wrong
or
right
in
understanding
your
argument
to
be
that
in
this
federal
habeas
corpus
case,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
in
error
in
applying
the
thompson
standard
rather
than
the
winship
standard?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
your
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
really,
that's
what
i
thought
your
argument
was
mrs.
colville,
not
what
their
result
should
be
in
this
case,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
rather
that
the
federal
courts
and
federal
habeas
corpus
since
the
winship
case
which
came
in
after
the
thompson
case
are
obligated
by
the
constitution
to
apply
a
different
test
and
a
different
rule
than
was
applied
here.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
--
despite
your
practice
since
time
in
memorial
in
the
state
of
virginia,
not
until
the
winship
case
was
it
squarely
decided
that
the
federal
constitution
required
that
a
state
prove
a
person
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
it
could
convict
them,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
certainly
not
a
new
rule
in
the
common
law,
but
i
--
it's
my
understanding
that
not
until
the
winship
case
had
it
been
squarely
decided
by
this
court
that
it's
constitutional
--
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
since
it
was
constitutionalized
at
that
point
and
since
it's
been
the
practice
since
time
almost
in
memorial,
a
federal
courts
on
federal
habeas
corpus
to
apply
constitutional
test
to
state
criminal
convictions.
why
shouldn't
the
rule
of
winship
be
the
applicable
test
now
that
winship's
been
decided
which
came
after
thompson?
justice
potter
stewart
well
on
that
basis
we
could
just
not
consider
first
amendment
questions,
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
that
will
save
some
time.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
true
on
any
federal
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
because
you
have
to
exhaust
your
state
remedies
before
you
can
even
go
into
federal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
if
it's
a
constitutional
duty
to
do
it,
it's
a
constitutional
duty
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that
is
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it'd
be
too
bad
if
it's
going
to
add
a
lot
of
business
to
the
federal
courts,
but
if
that's
their
job,
it's
their
job.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
would
lead,
i
should
think
inexorably
to
the
conclusion
that
if
there
has
been
a
valid
conviction
in
the
state
court,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
there
can
never
be
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that
would've
denied
review
in
thompson
against
louisville.
obviously
the
police
court
in
louisville
there
thought
that
there
was
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
it
would
not
have
convicted
thompson.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
--
that
of
course
there's
opportunity
for
discretionary
direct
review,
the
petition
for
certiorari
here.
but
we're
talking
here
about
federal
habeas
corpus
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
leads
ineluctably
to
the
conclusion
that
federal
habeas
corpus
is
never
available
if
there's
been
a
valid
state
court
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
for
what?
justice
potter
stewart
but
when
there's
been
a
full
and
fair
hearing
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
there's
no
federal
habeas
corpus
ever.
justice
potter
stewart
for
anything
that's
where
your
argument
leads.
justice
potter
stewart
well
and
would
constitutional
rights
be
violated
if
a
state
had
convicted
a
person
on
evidence
of
a
lesser
standard
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
winship?
justice
potter
stewart
had
they
mouthed
the
right
things
to
the
jury,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
just
what
this
is
about,
isn't
it?
that's
what
exactly
what
this
case
is
about.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if,
to
go
a
little
further
with
my
brother
marshall's
suggestion
and
this
had
been
a
jury
trial
and
there
had
been
absolutely
perfect
instructions
on
the
duty
of
a
jury
not
to
convict
until
it
found
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
on
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
but
that
in
fact
the
evidence
was
no
stronger
than
it
was
in
thompson
against
louisville
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
state
appellant
system
erroneously,
let's
assume,
had
held
the
instructions
were
fine
and
we
think
the
evidence
was
sufficient
under
that
standard.
now
is
a
federal
district
court
absolutely
foreclosed
from
examining
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
there's
no
procedural
default
at
all.
there'd
been
pursuit
of
state
remedies
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
end
of
federal
habeas
corpus.
that's
what
i
thought
you
argued.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
i
argument
i
think
leads
to
overruling
thompson
against
louisville
at
least
in
so
far
as
its
applicability
to
collateral
attack
goes?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
i
think
it's
right,
isn't
it
--
it's
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
it's
--
i
don't
agree
that
it's
necessarily
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
would
be
of
an
expansion
of
stone
against
powell,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
but
the
stone
against
powell
approach.
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
stone
against
powell
approach.
justice
potter
stewart
through
this
kind
of
--
