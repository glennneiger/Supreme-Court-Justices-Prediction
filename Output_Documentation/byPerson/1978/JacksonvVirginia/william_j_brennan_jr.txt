justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
ask
mr.
attorney
general
of
course
review
was
not
sought
of
the
decision
of
your
supreme
court
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
there
had
been
a
petition
to
review
your
supreme
court
on
the
ground
that
winship
had
not
been
properly
applied?
now
surely
that's
a
federal
question
which
could've
reviewed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
might
have
disagreed
with
your
supreme
court
and
reversed
this
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
your
suggestion
is
that
we
ought
--
litigants
ought
to
be
limited
to
come
in
to
us
directly
and
review
from
state
courts
rather
than
go
into
federal
habeas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why,
don't
we
have
enough
to
do
up
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
now,
you
know
what's
--
you
know
something
about
the
happenstance
of
certiorari
grants,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
understand
your
argument,
perhaps
i
misunderstand
it,
you
suggest
we
ought
to
foreclose
habeas
review
in
cases
like
this
and
limit
the
review
if
there's
to
be
any
federal
review
to
direct
review
by
this
court
of
your
higher
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
no
secret
to
you,
i
didn't
agree
with
any
of
those.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
to
that
extent
i
gather
a
pro
tanto
appeal
by
the
court
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
that
congress
enacted
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
said
a
pro
tanto.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
don't
understand
mr.
attorney
general
why
if
that
can
be
the
end
of
it,
why
couldn't
it
be
the
end
of
review
by
this
court
directly
of
the
virginia
supreme
court?
why
aren't
you
arguing,
we
ought
also
be
barred
from
the
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
not
concede
--
you
concede
it's
not
the
end
of
it
to
the
extent
of
direct
review
by
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
surely
we'll
be
swamped.
it
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
handle
it,
obviously
if
the
only
review
can
be
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
clearly
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
colville,
you
just
gave
me
an
answer
that
i
know
but
i'm
just
little
confused.
is
the
standard
you
proposed
the
same
as
the
standard
that's
applied
in
direct
review
in
virginia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it's
somewhat
narrower
standard
i
would
presume
then?
