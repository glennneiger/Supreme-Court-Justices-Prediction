chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
jackson
against
virginia.
mrs.
colville,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
how
did
this
district
judge
come
to
be
addressing
this
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wasn't
--
this
wasn't
the
first
time
the
case
had
been
before
a
court.
the
case
wasn't
initiated
in
the
federal
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
federal
court
doing
with
it?
what
brought
the
federal
court
end
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
by
what
kind
of
a
procedure
was
he
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
impression
from
your
earlier
remarks
that
the
case
was
being
tried
by
a
federal
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
federal
difference,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
some
time,
it
was
accepted
before
the
constitution
was
developed,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
difference
in
the
standard
when
a
judge
tries
a
case
without
a
jury
and
when
he
tries
it
with
a
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
are
you
suggesting
that
the
federal
court
should
apply
a
different
standard
from
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
reviewing
the
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
evidence
do
you
base
your
statement
on,
mrs.
colville,
that
virginia
has
not
accepted
winship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
they
said
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
rational
judge
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
fact
finder.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
want
to
get
at,
and
i'm
not
clear
on.
i'm
still
confused
from
the
onset
of
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
there
should
be
the
same
standard
in
the
federal
district
court
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
there
would
be
in
the
state
review?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that's
a
substantive
for
the
trial
in
the
state
court,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
that
continue
--
does
that
continue
all
the
way
through
up
in
habeas
corpus
or
2255,
2254
if
the
state
have
a
similar
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
doesn't
this
case
come
to
us
with
a
presumption
that
of
regularity
in
the
application
of
the
federal
constitution
by
the
virginia
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
you
really
arguing
that
because
the
federal
district
judge
on
habeas
corpus
or
that
a
federal
district
judge
on
habeas
corpus,
if
that
judge
disagrees
with
the
state
court
judge
who
tried
out
the
fact
issue,
then
the
federal
court
determination
prevails,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
three
other
federal
court
judges
on
the
fourth
circuit
can
do
an
opposite
conclusion
from
that
of
a
district
judge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
it
not
the
question,
mr.
attorney
general,
whether
after
winship
the
states
in
the
trial
of
criminal
cases
are
constitutionally
obliged
to
find
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
reasonable
doubt
standard,
isn't
that
all
winship
decided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
had
nothing
to
do
directly
with
collateral
attacks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
state
in
the
union
if
you
know
at
the
time
of
winship
that
did
not
apply?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
reasonable
out
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where's
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
you
think
the
habeas
--
federal
habeas
statute
was
intended
as
a
substitute
or
an
additional
layer
of
review
in
the
conventional
sense
of
review?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
scope
of
the
federal
judge
in
virginia
then
is
not
the
same
as
the
scope
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
virginia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
had
12
lay
jurors
who
passed
on
this
issue,
mr.
attorney
general,
would
we
have
any
better
information
or
knowledge
about
their
capacity
to
make
that
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
instructs
himself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mrs.
colville?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
