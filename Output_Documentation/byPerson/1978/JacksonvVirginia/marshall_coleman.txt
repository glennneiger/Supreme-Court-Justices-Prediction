mr.
marshall
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
may
please
the
court.
this
case
does
present
the
narrow
legal
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
some
evidence
standard
that
was
established
in
the
thompson
against
city
of
louisville
case
should
be
overturned
in
favor
of
a
rule
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
upon
a
collateral
attack
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
of
a
virginia
or
state
judgment.
and
it
is
our
position
that
those
two
cases
are
thoroughly
consistent
one
with
the
other,
and
that
as
the
chief
justice
has
suggested,
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
has
been
employed
in
the
several
states
for
time
out
of
mind.
and
in
fact,
is
the
standard
in
virginia
and
upon
review
by
the
virginia
supreme
court,
the
test
is
whether
a
rational
juror
could
decide
and
hold
that
proof
had
been
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
have
review
by
transcript
already
in
virginia.
when
someone
files
a
petition
for
writ
to
our
virginia
supreme
court,
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
hearing,
but
he
is
entitled
to
a
review
of
the
record
to
determine
on
the
question
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
whether
that
is
shown
in
the
transcript.
mr.
marshall
coleman
my
reading
of
winship
is
that
the
court
was
sitting
in
that
case
that
as
to
a
juvenile
trial,
the
proof
had
to
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
if
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient,
and
that
less
there
be
any
doubt
it
would
say
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
was
the
rule.
but
i
have
cited
some
cases
here
that
i
think
suggested
that
that
was
not
a
new
rule,
whether
it
was
one
that
was
applicable.
mr.
marshall
coleman
i
think
that's
right,
it
was
constitutionalized
at
that
point
clearly.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
think
for
several
reasons.
i
think
the
reasons
that
have
already
been
alluded
to
of
the
effective
use
of
resources,
federalism,
comity,
avoiding
friction
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
marshall
coleman
it
would
save
some
time,
but
in
this
case
you
see
there
is
never
--
the
case
is
tried
first
in
the
state
court
then
it's
taken
on
appeal.
mr.
marshall
coleman
then
it
comes
back
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
marshall
coleman
and
then
the
question
there
becomes
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
it
is,
except
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
right,
but
with
respect
to
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
first.
that
is
an
objection
that
any
defendant
can
make.
so
that
the
resources
of
the
court,
if
it
has
to
go
through
and
have
another
trial
by
transcript
would
be
monumental
and
it
would
engage
the
resources
of
the
federal
courts
to
the
extent
that
it
would
be
using
up
the
time
of
the
courts
that
could
better
be
focused
to
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
think
the
constitutional
duty
if
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
the
question
is
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
precisely
the
point.
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
precisely
the
point
that
is
made
in
the
brief.
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
marshall
coleman
i
don't
know
of
any.
mr.
marshall
coleman
but
i
do
think
that
after
winship,
in
every
case,
the
rule
was
is
there
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
a
standard
in
the
state
court.
now
what
the
louisville
rule
i
think
established
was
that
the
court
was
willing
to
look
at
the
record
to
see
if
there
was
any
evidence
to
support
that.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
could
consider
in
this
case
that
since
there
is
an
interest
in
cutting
back
on
these
cases
and
the
rule
of
stone
against
powell
is
that
if
there
has
been
an
opportunity
for
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
state
court
that
there
is
no
need
to
redo
that
in
the
federal
court
and
that
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
right
and
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i'm
making
--
i'm
making
that
suggestion
to
the
court.
first
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
if
they
come
up
on
direct
review
that's
sufficient
to
protection
and
check
and
supervision
over
what's
happening
to
peoples
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
i
do.
i
realize
that
and
i'm
suggesting
that
habeas
corpus
could
still
exist
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
there
had
been
an
opportunity
for
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
but
once
there
has
been
given
that
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
to
consider
that
as
a
possibility.
we
have
urged
in
this
case
first
of
all
that
the
thompson
rule
should
be
maintained,
we
think
that's
very
important.
but
in
view
of
the
cases
that
have
occurred
recently,
the
wainwright
case
and
estelle
and
francis
and
stone
against
powell
that
would
certainly
be
consistent
with
our
line.
mr.
marshall
coleman
i
read
that.
your
honor,
as
i
would
say
simply
that
in
this
case
that
could
change
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
in
stone
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
that
was
not
true
in
stone
against
powell.
i
think
it
is
different
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principle
makes
sense
across
the
board,
because
stone
against
powell
is
saying
“if
there's
an
opportunity
for
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
there
needs
to
be
an
end”
and
has
been
said
in
one
of
the
cases
that
if
a
thing
could
be
done
well
once
there's
no
need
to
do
it
twice.
mr.
marshall
coleman
i
understand
that.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
as
far
as
sufficiency
of
evidence
is
concerned.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
there've
always
be
the
opportunity
for
direct
review,
and
there've
always
be
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
think
it
is
available
for
the
court
to
determine
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
--
the
question
of
the
opportunity
of
the
full
and
fair
hearing,
i
don't
think
that's
been
completely
flushed
out
i
don't
think
we
know
exactly
what
the
confines
were
of.
mr.
marshall
coleman
for
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
think
what
the
effect
of
habeas
corpus
would
be
is
to
see
still
if
constitutional
rights
are
being
violated.
if
there's
not
in
fact
a
full
and
fair
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
i
think
that
under
winship,
the
only
test
would
be
had
that
--
has
that
standard
of
proof
been
applied
in
the
case.
mr.
marshall
coleman
but
i
think
that
there
would
be
ways
to
look
behind
the
substance
--
look
to
the
substance
if
the
appearance
of
justice
did
not
conform
with
the
substance
about
there.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
if
it
please
the
court,
i
will
settle
for
the
adoption
as
i
say
in
the
brief
of
the
thompson
rule,
but
i
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
if
there'd
been
a
jury
in
this
case?
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
except
that
the
law
--
you
may
be
right
about
that.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
there
couldn't
be
argument
about
what
standard
they
were
supposed
to
apply
but
the
law
in
virginia
is
that
the
judge
is
supposed
to
apply
the
same
standard
that
the
trier
of
fact
does.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
haven't
thought
about
that.
i
think
that
as
long
as
the
standard
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
if
it's
helpful
i'll
adopt
it.
mr.
marshall
coleman
if
you
adopt
the
standard,
i
think
that
you're
in
the
same
position
that
you're
in
with
wainwright
that
you
are
cut
off
because
of
procedural
default
there.
here
you
are
cut
off
if
you
had
an
opportunity
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
i
think
you're
right,
as
long
as
there's
the
ability
to
raise
that
question
and
get
a
full
and
fair
hearing
under
those
standards
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
marshall
coleman
now,
my
point
on
that
your
honor
is
simply
that
there
is
i
think
in
this
court
a
greater
sensitivity
to
the
integrity
and
capacities
of
the
state
courts.
there's
a
growing
recognition
that
the
state
courts
are
well
able
to
apply
federal
law,
to
administer
their
state
criminal
laws
and
that
as
long
as
they
are
doing
that,
that
there's
no
reason
to
retry
cases,
to
duplicate
effort
and
to
expand
the
time
between
when
someone
is
charged
and
when
the
case
is
over.
mr.
marshall
coleman
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
obviously,
in
order
to
uphold
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit.
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
go
this
far,
and
the
chief
thrust
of
my
brief
obviously
is
simply
that
the
standard
of
louisville
against
thompson
is
still
the
correct
application,
except
that
the
court
wants
to
go
further
and
break
out
and
into
a
new
area
and
say
“as
far
as
sufficiency
as
the
evidence
is
concerned
we're
satisfied
the
state
courts
can
do
it
and
do
it
well.”
and
that's
been
the
experience
in
the
past.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
it
would.
it
would
be.
mr.
marshall
coleman
it
would
be,
certainly
it
would
be.
mr.
marshall
coleman
it'd
be
the
application
of
the
stone
against
powell
doctrine
into
this
case.
mr.
marshall
coleman
you
know,
i
think
there'd
still
be
something
there
for
habeas.
mr.
marshall
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
coleman
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
coleman
excuse
me?
mr.
marshall
coleman
you've
seen
where
the
state
judge
is
what?
i
didn't
hear
that
part.
mr.
marshall
coleman
right,
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
it
be
true
in
people
that
had
gone
before
a
jury
in
a
different
manner
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
--
i
suppose
because
you'd
be
cutting
off,
you'd
be
chilling
somewhat,
i
suppose,
their
interest
in
taking
the
jury
trial.
but
i
think
that
he
would
be
just
as
capable.
the
question
that
all
of
this
raises
in
my
mind
is
that
who
is
to
say
what
is
a
correct
verdict?
a
judge
is
--
disagree
on
points
that
are
very
particularized
and
very
slight
in
many
cases,
it's
been
said
by
justice
jackson
that
this
court
is
infallible
because
it's
final
and
it's
not
final
because
it's
infallible.
there
could
be
a
different
disposition
if
we
had
another
level
of
appellate
courts.
we
have
one
judge
in
chesterfield
agreeing
and
thinking
its
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
we
have
the
district
court
disagreeing
that
fourth
circuit
comes
back
and
says
“well
it
takes
another
view,
it's
okay.”
this
court
might
have
a
third
or
fourth
view
and
then
there
might
be,
if
it
were
tried
in
a
different
form.
so
the
point
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
very
important
consideration
not
to
be
dismissed
out
of
hand
that
the
finality
of
these
proceedings
and
the
dignity
and
integrity
of
the
state
courts
is
of
such
a
level
now
that
the
court
might
consider
departing
and
in
fact
contracting
the
expansion
of
habeas
corpus.
this
would
give
the
court,
it
seems
to
me,
the
ability
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
fewer
needles
in
the
haystack,
because
in
looking
for
all
those
needles
sometimes
i
think
it
almost
comes
to
the
point
is
it
worth
finding
and
will
we
recognize
when
we
see
them?
hundreds
of
pages
of
transcripts
gone
through,
i
think
even
for
applying
the
some
evidence
standard,
obviously
it's
much
easier
but
it's
still
a
tremendous
job.
and
so
i
would
simply
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
state
courts
know
how
to
administer
the
criminal
laws
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
limited
to
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
no
i
don't
want
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
think
that
it's
there
for
cases
where
there
is
not
proper
respect
and
regard
for
the
federal
bill
of
rights.
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
still
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
don't
think
the
result
ought
to
have
an
effect
now
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
you
might
disagree
with
the
result.
but
there's
something
to
uphold
it,
if
it's
arguable
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
think
that
we've
seen
in
wainwright
that
the
court
is
willing
to
decide
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
confess
that
i've
had
trouble
in
figuring
where
this
line
ought
to
be
drawn.
i
know
you're
much
more
capable
of
doing
that
than
i
am,
but
i
think
that
with
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
i
can
make
a
case,
as
i've
tried
to
do
today
that
that
is
one
area
where
you
had
a
sifting
of
the
evidence.
you
had
a
full
canvas
by
the
state
procedures
of
the
facts.
it's
going
to
the
appellate
review.
you've
got
judges
that
are
experienced
and
practiced
in
these
matters
and
that
that
could
be
the
end
of
it
consistent
with
the
constitutional
obligation.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
think
that
one
reason
is
that
that
does
give
you
check
and
as
you
say
it
seems
sometimes
to
be
in
frequent
that
you
get
certiorari
but
you
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
it's
not
and
i
think
when
you
take
weigh
all
these
habeas
corpus
petitions
you're
going
to
have
an
ability
to
render
more
suits.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
think
in
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
the
habeas
statute
has
of
course
been
a
changing
thing
over
the
years.
it
seems
to
me
that
its
idea
was
the
vindication
of
fairness,
of
due
process,
the
constitutional
rights
that
all
people
in
the
country
have.
and
i
think
its
expansion
has
grown,
it
was
originally
thought,
i
believe,
to
contest
only
matters
of
jurisdiction.
there's
a
historical
disagreement
of
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
don't
think
it
is.
if
you
adopted
winship,
it
seems
to
me
you
would
make
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
and
the
supreme
court
in
every
state
in
the
union
absolutely
inferior
to
every
district
court.
mr.
marshall
coleman
no,
it
wasn't.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
the
trial
judge
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
but
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
marshall
coleman
and
it
would
be
true
here.
mr.
marshall
coleman
i
don't
think
we
would.
we
have
no
information
about
that
process.
mr.
marshall
coleman
you
could.
mr.
marshall
coleman
of
course
the
judge
also
is
supposed
to
know
the
law.
mr.
marshall
coleman
well
the
point
that
i
would
--
mr.
marshall
coleman
he
does
it
and
he's
familiar
with
the
law.
the
question
of
finality
that
is
being
raised
here
i
think
is
an
important
one
because
in
so
many
other
issues
a
person
is
not
set
free
if
we
find
ten
years
later
that
somebody
didn't
commit
the
crime
because
another
person
confesses
to
its
remedy
as
executive
clemency.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
state
trial
when
a
person
has
gone
through
the
trial
and
has
appealed
the
matter
and
found
guilty
that
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
and
so
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
all
i
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
application
of
stone
against
powell,
drawing
the
line
as
i
have
suggested
on
these
questions
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
the
theory
that
if
a
job
can
be
done
once
well
there's
no
reason
to
do
it
twice.
if
the
court
does
not
feel
that
it
wants
to
do
--
make
that
departure,
clearly
the
rule
of
thompson
against
city
of
louisville
is
applicable
and
is
not
inconsistent
with
in
re
winship.
thank
you.
