justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
colville,
the
facts
of
winship,
were
that
the
trial
judge
stated
that
he
could
find
these
particular
defendant's
guilty
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
he
couldn't
bring
himself
to
find
him
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
define
--
where
do
you
get
your
definition
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
that,
but
i
presume
that
if
your
argument
were
accepted
by
this
court,
other
courts
would
have
to
decide
was
there
or
was
there
not
proof
“beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.”
where
do
you
get
the
definition
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
it
isn't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
prepared
at
least
now
to
expand
on
simply
the
phrase
“beyond
a
reasonable
doubt”
in
offering
guidances
to
how
courts
would
analyze
transcripts
under
situations
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
counsel,
you
just
said
that
the
innocence
is
of
overwriting
importance.
i
don't
know
whether
you
mean
to
suggest
that
that
is
the
only
conceivable
factor
to
be
considered.
you're
familiar
with
our
decision,
patterson
against
new
york
where
we
said
punishment
of
those
found
guilty
by
a
jury,
for
example,
is
not
forbidden
merely
because
there
is
a
remote
possibility
in
some
instances
that
an
innocent
person
might
go
to
jail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i'm
just
curious
now
whether
you
think
that
innocence
is
--
the
possibility
of
innocence
is
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
only
factor,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
patterson
against
new
york
was
a
direct
appeal
here
from
the
state
court,
so
there
wasn't
any
problem
of
comity
on
federal
habeas.
and
it
was
in
that
case
that
the
court
said
that
punishment
of
those
found
guilty
by
a
jury
is
not
forbidden
merely
because
there
is
a
remote
possibility
in
some
instances
that
an
innocent
person
might
go
to
jail.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes
well
but
that
was
on
exclusionary
sense,
in
the
sense
that
if
you
--
if
there
was
no
--
if
the
claim
made
had
no
bearing
on
innocence,
perhaps
it
couldn't
be
treated
in
federal
habeas.
but
there's
never
been
any
suggestion
that
any
federal
constitutional
claim
couldn't
be
treated
on
direct
review
here
as
was
the
case
in
patterson.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
coleman,
i
don't
know
whether
you
are
in
on
the
initial
habeas
proceedings
or
not,
but
i
notice
on
page
25
of
the
appendix
that
the
case
not
only
has
a
civil
number,
it
has
a
magistrate
number.
do
you
know
whether
this
case
was
originally
referred
by
the
habeas
judge
to
a
magistrate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
colville,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
if
i
might?
i
suppose
one
could
apply
your
standard
to
a
trial
that
took
20
days
and
had
80
witnesses
and
a
transcript
of
many
thousands
of
pages.
and
is
the
procedure
you
contemplate
that
would
just
simply
be
submitted
to
the
habeas
judge
for
his
perusal
or
referral
by
him
to
a
magistrate
if
that
was
his
inclination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
swiftly
review
several
thousand
pages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
like
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
argument
on
appeal,
say
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
