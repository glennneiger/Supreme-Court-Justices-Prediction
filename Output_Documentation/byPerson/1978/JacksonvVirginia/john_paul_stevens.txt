mrs.
colville,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
theory
as
to
why
there
--
rather
why
the
judgment
is
arbitrary
of
premeditation
issue.
is
it
because
you
think
no
rational
judge
could
conclude
that
the
defendant
was
not
intoxicated,
or
is
it
because
you
argue
that
no
rational
judge
could
find
that
shooting
twice
and
reloading
the
gun
and
shooting
from
only
a
half
an
inch
away
and
so
forth,
could
be
evidence
of
premeditation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
no
rational
judge
could
believe
he
was
not
intoxicated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
of
appeals
sought
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
deputy
sheriff
obviously
didn't
think
he
was
totally
intoxicated
because
he
let
him
retain
his
weapon
after
he'd
seen
him
with
the
weapon.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
some
evidence
of
non
--
not
being
totally
being
intoxicated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he'd
consumed
the
fifth
of
whiskey,
but
you're
asking
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
you're
asking
for
a
constitutional
rule
that
proof
that
the
man
has
consumed
at
least
a
fifth
of
whiskey,
demolishes
the
possibility
that
he
could
not
be
--
could
not
have
the
record
and
ability
to
kill
someone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
