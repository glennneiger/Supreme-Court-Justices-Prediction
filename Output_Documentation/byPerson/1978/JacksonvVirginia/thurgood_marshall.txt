justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
find
him
guilty
of
manslaughter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
doesn't
that
take
it
out
from
under
thompson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thompson,
they
said,
you
couldn't
debate
him
under
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
was
a
question
of
degree.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
no
difference
in
thompson
and
louisville.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
he
should
go
free?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
renewed
thompson
v.
louisville
to
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
re-sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
isn't
it
a
question
in
fact
as
to
whether
the
man
is
drunk
at
night?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
didn't
the
judge
decide
that
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
can
you
attack
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
why
is
it
irrational
that
this
--
to
find
that
this
man
wasn't
too
drunk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
evidence
do
you
have
to
show
that
he
was
not
too
drunk,
or
that
he
was
too
drunk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
have
is
that
he
was
drunk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
know
some
people
who
get
drunk
over
one
drink
of
whiskey,
and
i
know
others
who
can
drink
two-fifths
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
before
getting
drunk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
let
me
give
you
an
easy
one
mr.
attorney
general.
if
this
had
been
a
jury
trial
with
the
finest
of
instructions
on
reasonable
doubt
etcetera,
and
the
same
record
we
have
here,
wouldn't
you
be
in
a
better
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
the
full
instruction
on
reasonable
doubt
right
out
of
winship.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
you
be
have
been
--
wouldn't
you
be
in
better
shape?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
don't
want
to
draw
the
line
between
those
two?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
just
being
helpful
that's
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
appropriate
as
it
mentioned
but
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
believe
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
a
great
amount
of
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
with
the
judge
trial
as
compared
with
the
jury
trial.
i've
seen
instances
where
the
federal
district
judge
was
a
former
state
judge
of
the
same
state.
and
where
you
have
a
judge
trial
without
a
jury
trial,
why
can
he
do
the
same
thing?
he's
a
former
state
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
the
district
judge
is
a
former
state
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
ask
him
to
pass
on
a
judgment
by
a
state
judge
in
a
trial
without
a
jury,
wouldn't
you
give
him
some
leeway?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
another
easy
one.
it's
true
that
according
to
this
record,
nobody
who
has
made
a
decision
in
this
case
has
shown
any
expertise
in
when
the
man
is
too
drunk
to
know
what
he
has
done,
up
until
now,
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
trial
judge
could've
been
--
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
mean
we
don't
know
how
he
knows
when
a
man
is
too
drunk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
exactly.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i'm
saying,
but
what
we'll
we
do?
what'll
we
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
have
an
instruction
on
it,
couldn't
you,
with
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
thought
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
composition
is
that
he
has
trained
as
a
virginia
judge
to
do
the
same
thing
a
jury
does,
and
he
does
it
that
way
--
