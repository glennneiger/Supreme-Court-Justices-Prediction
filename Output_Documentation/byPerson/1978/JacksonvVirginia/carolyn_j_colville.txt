ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
a
federal
district
court
should
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
when
there
is
insufficient
evidence
in
the
state
court
record
to
convince
a
rational
trier
of
fact
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
a
statement
of
the
relevant
proceedings
is
as
follows.
the
petitioner,
james
a.
jackson,
who
was
tried
and
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
in
the
circuit
court
of
chesterfield
county,
he
was
sentenced
to
30
years
in
prison.
briefly,
the
evidence
indicated
that
he
had
shot
the
deceased,
mrs.
mary
cole
twice,
that
several
shots
were
fired
at
the
scene.
that
he
engaged
in
target
practice
that
day.
however,
there
was
an
extensive
evidence
indicating
he
consumed
a
large
amount
of
alcohol,
and
shortly
before
the
death
of
mrs.
cole,
the
two
of
them
had
drank
two-fifths
of
whiskey,
a
fifth
of
some
other
alcoholic
beverage,
it
was
not
divulged
in
the
record,
and
an
undetermined
amount
of
beer.
he
admitted
to
the
shooting
in
the
statement
made
to
the
police
but
indicated
it
was
in
self-defense.
he
then
unsuccessfully
appealed
this
case
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
he
thereupon
filed
a
pro
se
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
in
which
he
made
numerous
allegations,
including
an
allegation
that
his
conviction
for
first-degree
murder
was
unsupported
by
evidence
of
premeditation.
the
district
court
judge
thereupon
searched
the
record
and
determined
that
he
could
find
no
evidence
of
premeditation
to
be
found.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
mr.
jackson
alleged
in
his
petition
that
his
evidence
--
that
his
conviction
was
not
supported
by
evidence
of
premeditation.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no,
it
is
initiated
in
the
circuit
court
of
chesterfield
county,
virginia.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
he
then
an
unsuccessfully
appeal
in
the
case
of
virginia
supreme
court.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
he
was
alleging
a
deprivation
of
rights.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
he
filed
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
right.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
and
in
the
petition
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no,
no.
the
district
court
judge
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
yes
there
is
your
honor.
the
district
court
judge
searched
the
state
court
record,
and
determined
that
he
could
not
find
evidence
of
premeditation.
he
then
dismissed
the
other
allegations
for
failure
to
exhaust
the
court
remedies.
the
state
of
virginia
thereupon
filed
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
in
a
per
curium
opinion
reversed
the
findings
of
the
district
court
judge
and
held
that
it
could
find
some
evidence
of
premeditation
and
need
not
search
the
record
any
further
then
just
say
--
need
not
search
the
record
in
any
further
to
see
if
a
rational
trier
of
fact
could've
found
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
whereupon,
we
filed
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
both
the
district
court
and
the
federal
court
of
appeals
applied
virginia
law,
whereupon
one
may
be
so
intoxicated
as
to
be
incapable
of
deliberation.
in
addition,
both
courts
applied
the
holding
of
the
1960
case
of
thompson
versus
city
of
louisville,
which
held
that
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
to
convict
and
punish
a
person
without
some
evidence
of
guilt.
it
is
our
contention
that
it
is
also
a
violation
of
due
process
to
convict
and
punish
a
person
when
no
rational
trier
of
fact
could've
found
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
a
rational
trier
could've
found
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
i
think
it's
possible
that
they
could've
found
him
guilty
of
manslaughter.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
excuse
me?
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
i
think
the
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
certainly
it
is
a
question
of
degree.
we
personally
have
no
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well
i
think
the
holdings
of
this
court
after
thompson
in
at
least
four
years
after
about
1974,
indicated
that
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
of
every
element
of
the
offense.
we're
indicating
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
premeditation.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no,
your
honor.
the
respondents
have
addressed
the
issue
of
what
can
be
done
even
if
this
court
found
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence.
i
think
the
common
belief
is
that
he
could
not
be
retried
for
first-degree
murder
due
to
the
double
jeopardy
cause
of
the
constitution.
however,
we
would
agree
that
he
could
either
be
sent
back
to
the
state
courts
for
re-sentencing
for
second
degree
or
for
a
retrial,
because
the
only
issue
has
been
premeditation,
a
necessary
element
of
first-degree
murder
not
second
degree.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
to
send
it
back
to
the
state
courts?
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor.
our
contention
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
well
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well,
your
honor
first
of
all,
there
was
not
a
jury
in
this
case.
it
was
tried
by
a
judge.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
certainly.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
your
honor,
it's
our
contention
that
in
re
winship,
which
held
the
due
process
clause
as
a
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
there
be
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
certainly,
a
jury
instruction
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
can
not
convict
unless
there
is
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
is
insufficient
if
in
fact
that
jury
has
found
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
certainly,
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
this
court
in
addressing
the
issue
with
the
juvenile
indicated
that
in
a
juvenile
proceeding
that
there
can
not
be
a
conviction
unless
the
tragedy
has
been
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now
arguably,
the
federal
courts
have
said
that
this
is
only
a
jury
instruction.
however,
at
least
four
courts
and
at
least
two
appeals
courts
in
the
context
of
a
direct
appeal
have
indicated
that
in
re
winship
requires
that
there
would
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
from
in
re
winship,
which
held
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
this
in
a
criminal
setting
that
there
must
be
--
that
you
could
not
convict
a
person
unless
there
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
your
honor,
that's
not
an
easy
question.
i
do
think
that
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
--
that
in
--
that
it
has
been
a
standard.
this
has
been
generally
accepted
in
both
the
federal
and
state
courts
for
some
time.
and
i
think
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor.
it
has
been
accepted
for
some
time
and
i
think
that
the
courts
are
far
more
familiar
with
that
standard
than
the
“no
evidence”
standard
of
thompson,
which
i
submit
is
a
far
more
difficult
standard
for
our
court
to
apply
than
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
courts
are
familiar
with
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
have
not
been
with
the
“no
evidence”
rule
of
thompson.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well
certainly,
well,
your
honor,
if
you
mean
by
can
we
offer
a
definition?
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no.
i
think
what
we
can
offer
is
that
if
this
court
adopted
our
position,
does
the
due
process
clause
requires
this?
and
that
it
is
something
that
is
cognizable
in
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
what
we
would
be
suggesting
is
that
the
federal
district
court
would
give
great
deference
to
the
findings
of
the
state.
we're
not
suggesting
that
there
would
be
a
great
overruling
on
the
state
court
cases.
what
we're
saying
is,
if
there's
conflict
of
testimony,
the
conflict
should
in
most
cases
be
favoring
the
state.
we're
not
asking
a
second
guessing.
we
were
asking
if
there
is
a
clear
issue
of
innocence
here
then
the
federal
courts
should
intervene.
if
it's
a
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
clearly
erroneous,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
in
virginia,
there
has
not
been
a
ruling
indicating
that
in
re
winship
requires
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
this
state
to
overrule
the
lower
court
findings.
what
they've
indicated
is,
if
the
finding
is
clearly
erroneous,
or
in
this
particular
case
where
there
is
--
they
simply
indicated
whether
there
has
been
any
violations
of
the
constitution.
they
did
not
elaborate
on
that
for
virginia
as
of
right
now
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
if
it's
clearly
erroneous.
they
have
not
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
if
you
are
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
clearly
erroneous,
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no,
your
honor,
both
would
be
under
an
obligation
to
find
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
this
particular
case,
we
did
have
a
judge
and
we
have
briefed
the
argument
that
it
should
not
make
any
difference
that
a
judge
tried
this
case
to
rather
than
a
jury.
i've
--
you
know,
honestly,
i
don't
think
a
judge
will
make
an
error
as
often
as
a
jury.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
your
honor,
i
think
if
virginia
has
not
accepted
in
re
winship
as
requiring
as
substantive
right
to
proof
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
your
honor,
they've
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no,
there's
simply
has
not
been
any
holding
where
they
have
come
down
and
said
that
we
will
overturn
if
the
proof
is
insufficient,
if
the
proof
has
not
been
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
certainly
are.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
certainly,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
a
rational
trier.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
they're
saying
that
if
someone
had
acted
non-arbitrarily,
they
would
have
found
the
person
not
guilty.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
okay.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
i'm
suggesting
that
if
in
re
winship
which
we
feel
establishes
a
substantive
right
of
proof
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
--
yes
we
would
argue
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well
your
honor,
we
would
argue
that
if
the
there
is
a
several
right
to
a
proof
then
certainly
yes.
that
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
federal
district
judge
would
look
at
the
record.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor,
but
we
feel
the
mistake
has
been
made.
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
--
both
the
federal
district
judge
indicated
that
a
mistake
was
made
also.
that
in
fact
the
person
should've
been
acquitted
of
the
first-degree
murder.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
our
argument
is
at
this
point,
the
federal
courts
have
seemingly
not
adopted
the
position
of
rational
trier
of
fact
as
to
habeas
corpus
and
we
refer
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor.
now,
we've
realized
that
initial
years,
this
court
has
been
cutting
back
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
out
of
considerations
of
committee
and
federalism,
particularly
in
cases
where
someone
did
not
exhaust
their
state
court
remedies
or
someone
didn't
object,
or
in
particularly
the
stone
versus
powell
which
have
put
great
emphasis
on
in
our
brief,
where
the
exclusionary
rule
was
involved
which
this
court
held
that
frustrated
the
criminal
process.
however,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
particularly
look
at
footnote
31
of
that
case
where
it
was
indicated
that
innocence
is
at
the
heart
of
habeas
corpus
cause
what
we
are
in
fact
arguing
here
that
if
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
convince
a
rational
trier
of
fact
then
that
person
was
technically
innocent
of
that
offense.
now,
in
that
footnote,
the
court
discussed
various
states
rights
interest,
including
federalism,
state
autonomy
fiction.
however,
the
clear
implication
of
it
is
that
innocence
should
be
of
overriding
importance,
and
i
think
that's
basically
what
it
boils
down
to
here.
that
innocence
should
be
of
importance
to
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
considerations
of
committee
and
federalism
should
of
secondary
importance.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
my
argument
would
be
that
he
was
indeed
so
intoxicated
as
to
being
capable
of
premeditation.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
that
would
be
my
argument
and
the
virginia
law
in
mind
maybe
so
be
--
by
intoxicating
beverages
as
to
being
capable
of
deliberation.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
your
honor,
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no,
your
honor
we
would
not
agree
that
that
would
be
some
evidence.
i
think
the
record,
the
transcript,
indicates
that
first
of
all
the
deputy
sheriff
knew
the
woman
and
i
think
there's
some
doubt
whether
he
knew
the
petitioner.
but
apparently,
he
felt
embarrassed
by
them
coming
up
swaggering,
bloodshot
eyes
and
he
wanted
them
out.
i
think
he
also
indicated
that
he
wanted
badly
to
get
back
inside
the
café.
he
went
outside
with
him
but
wanted
to
get
back
in
the
copy
with
his
--
the
other
police
officers.
i
think
a
reasonable
rational
explanation
would
be
that
he
wanted
to
finish
his
dinner.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
matter
of
fact,
where
were
asked
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes,
your
honor,
where
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well
your
honor,
we're
arguing
that
a
rational
trier
of
fact
could
not
have
determined.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
because
i
think
the
record
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
i
think
the
fact
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well
your
honor,
i'm
not
asking
your
constitutional
rule
as
to
that.
i
am
asking
a
constitutional
rule
that
a
rational
trier
could
not
have
determined
that.
i
think
first
of
all
that
the
evidence
--
there
was
a
great
deal
of
evidence
here
that
he
had
drunk
the
entire
day.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
the
deputy
sheriff
that
you
referred
to
early,
mr.
justice
stevens
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
i
would
say
it
was
the
federal
district
court
judge
if
he
gives
all
the
deference
necessary
to
the
state
court
judge.
if
he
just
determines
at
that
point
that
no
rational
trier
of
fact
could've
found
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
in
this
particular
case,
intoxication
and
premeditation
then
i
would
say
yes
definitely
that
the
writ
would
have
to
be
issued.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well
--
well
your
honor,
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
in
its
opinion
first
of
all
held
that
it
was
under
the
obligation
to
follow
thompson
versus
city
of
louisville
and
then
went
on
to
say
that
it
did
not
feel
that
it
needed
to
look
at
if
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
convince
a
rational
trial.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
certainly
your
honor,
we're
arguing
--
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
--
we're
arguing
that
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
district
court
applied
the
wrong
standard.
they
applied
the
1960
standard,
the
thompson.
we
would
urge
that
the
1970
case
of
in
re
winship
should've
been
the
proper
standard
for
the
courts
to
have
applied
in
this
case.
and
that
we
feel
that
the
innocence
of
the
person
should
be
of
overwriting
importance
in
looking
at
other
state
considerations,
but
the
overall,
yes.
we're
asking
the
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
be
issued
if
no
rational
trier
of
fact
could've
found
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
for
that
particular
offense.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
didn't
catch
that,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
is
the
only
determination?
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no,
but
i
think
when
--
i
think
in
granting
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
we
have
to
look
at
if
there
is
been
a
deprivation
to
due
process
rights
then
i
think
other
principles
can
come
into
play.
this
court
has,
in
the
last
few
years,
indicated
comity
and
federalism
in
francis
versus
henderson,
estelle
versus
williams,
and
wainwright
versus
sykes
that
these
other
things
would
come
into
play.
but
that
when
innocence
is
at
the
heart
of
the
argument,
the
innocence
is
at
the
heart
of
the
right
involved
then
that
should
be
of
overwriting
importance.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well
your
honor,
i
can
just
go
back
to
my
argument
of
stone
versus
powell,
of
innocence
in
the
footnote
indicating
that
innocence
is
at
the
heart
of
habeas
corpus.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
certainly,
your
honor.
i
would
just
argue
that
in
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
this
should
be
the
proper
standard.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
your
honor,
just
a
very
brief
statement
about
what
exactly
we
are
seeking.
we
are
seeking
that
there
be
a
standard
in
habeas
corpus
that
no
--
if
no
rational
trier
of
fact
could've
found
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
should
issue.
in
this
particular
case,
we
would
ask
either
that
the
court
decide
as
to
the
facts
of
the
case
or
that
be
remanded
to
the
fourth
circuit,
who
had
already
indicated
that
it
had
some
doubts
in
its
mind
about
the
applicable
law
without
further
guidance
felt
they
had
to
apply
to
thompson.
we've
either
ask
that
the
court
apply
to
the
facts
of
the
case
or
remand
it
for
the
fourth
circuit
to
apply.
thank
you.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well,
my
basic
inclination
is
that
the
transcript
would
go
to
the
federal
district
judge.
he
would
then
have
the
benefit
of
the
wisdom
of
the
state
court,
plus
the
--
any
pleadings
found
on
behalf
of
the
state.
he
could
then
look
at
those
in
order
to
swiftly
review
that
particular
transcript.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
well
i
think
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
would
be
far
more
easier
if
the
state
says
“this
is
where
we
say
that
there's
reasonable
doubt.”
i
think
the
court
could
then
look
at
it
to
see
if
indeed
this
does
create
reasonable
doubt.
i
think
it
would
be
an
easier
process
if
they
are
being
guided
somewhat
as
to
what
the
state
says
the
reasonable
doubt
exists.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
certainly.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
no,
your
honor,
i
could
not
find
that
reasonable
doubt
was
the
rule
applied
in
virginia,
no.
ms.
carolyn
j.
colville
yes.
thank
you.
