justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
explanation
or
any
reason
for
not
borrowing
the
group
practice
of
optometry?
texas
permits
that,
doesn't
it?
it's
just
that
you
can
do
it
under
a
trade
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
statute
just
bars
how
you
hold
yourself
out
to
the
public,
or
just
what
kind
of
words
you
use
in
representing
yourself
to
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
any
other
aspect
of
group
practice
is
not
forbidden?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
billing,
in
any
communications
or
in
advertising
the
--
all
of
the
names
must
be
given?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
cannot
send
a
bill
out
under
just
a
trade
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
your
cases
explain
or
is
there
any
reason
for
distinguishing
between
unincorporated
groups
that
use
a
trade
name
and
partnerships
that
use
just
two
names
and
maybe
100
partners?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
there
be
under
the
texas
law,
be
two
named
partners
doing
business
and
spending
100%
of
their
time
on
the
job,
and
they
have
as
employees
50
others
who
aren't
partners?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
two
other
partners
of
the
100
men
partnership
could
open
the
offices
in
some
other
place
and
being
named
partners
and
all
the
other
unnamed
partners
could
shift
around
and
all
the
employees
could
move
in
and
out
of
these
various
branches
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
are
100
partners
or
50
partners,
two
can
be
the
name
partners
in
one
place
and
two
in
another
place,
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
i
have
four
partners
and
two
members,
the
four
can
practice
as
a
partnership
in
dallas
by
--
smith
and
jones
can
use
their
name,
and
brown
and
jackson
can
be
the
two
named
partners
in
fort
worth.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
if
the
single
practitioner
can
practice
under
his
own
name
and
with
20
employees,
all
of
them
were
doing
same
thing
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
patients
will
come
and
visit
anyone
of
those
of
employees
and
perhaps
never
see
them
in
whose
name
is
on
the
door?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
none
of
these
other
--
none
of
the
names
of
the
employees
have
to
be
on
the
door
or
on
any
stationary
or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
their
licenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
don't
have
their
names,
not
have
to
be
listed?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
have
to
have
the
license
on
the
wall.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
wouldn't
-
-
would
you
say
texas
could
not
require
that
optometry
be
practiced
only
by
individual
practitioners?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
general
rule
that
if
you
want
to
practice
optometry
you
do
so
by
yourself.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
not
only
you
must
practice
by
yourself
but
you
must
practice
under
your
own
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
texas
could
not
require
that
people
who
individual
practitioners
to
use
their
own
name
in
the
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
information
does
this
--
this
is
in
the
commercial
area,
i
take
it
is
in
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
information
does
the
trade
name
convey
to
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
something
that
is
--
just
take
my
example
now.
the
individuals'
name,
say
there
is
a
lot
that
says
that
practice
individually
and
use
your
own
name.
now
is
there
some
information
that
a
trade
name
would
convey
that
the
individuals'
own
name
would
not
convey?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
only
if
that
happened
and
the
same
thing
that
happened
with
the
individuals'
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
the
only
reason
that
trade
name
acquire
any
secondary
meaning
or
convey
some
information
is
because
of
the
kind
of
service
that
the
people
behind
the
trade
name
gave.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
suddenly
tomorrow,
the
same
people
are
not
behind
the
trade
name,
is
there
any
reality
to
this
meaning
of
the
trade
name?
in
one
day,
there
is
--
the
people
who
are
responsible
for
it
acquiring
some
value
are
suddenly
gone.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
happens
all
the
time,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
just
some
lousy
optometrist
came
in
and
took
over
it.
that's
all,
that's
what
we
are
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
for
a
while
and
that
texas
says,
if
you
are
going
to
change
the
people,
they
just
don't
want
the
people
behind
the
trade
name
to
change
without
it
being
noted.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
just
said
if
the
people
who
have
given
the
value
to
this
trade
name
are
suddenly
they
are
no
longer
and
have
been
replaced
by
somebody
else,
please
put
it
on
the
letterhead,
put
it
on
the
door
or
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
texas
require
that
if
you
want
to
do
business
under
a
trade
name,
you
must
go
up
to
the
state
house
or
down
to
the
county
clerk's
office
and
file
a
statement
of
the
names
of
the
people
who
are
behind
the
trade
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
keep
it
constantly
current?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think
they
can
make
them
put
the
names
on
the
door.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
they
make
them
put
the
names
of
everybody
in
the
group
on
their
stationary
and
in
their
advertisements?
apparently
not,
that
is
what
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
doing
a
business
under
a
trade
name,
if
you
use
a
trade
name
and
then
give
all
the
names.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
really
would
not
care
very
much,
if
you
had
to
put
down
all
the
names,
would
you
really
want
to
use
the
trade
names?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
to
value
that
past
activity
as
given
to
it
even
though
the
people
are
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
information
is
constrained?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
defense
counsel,
so
they
practice
under
the
name
small
ones.
