mr.
larry
niemann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
two
provisions
of
the
texas
optometry
act;
one
dealing
with
the
statutory
requirements
for
a
board
membership,
the
other
dealing
with
statutory
prohibitions
of
the
practice
of
optometry
under
an
assumed
name.
i
as
attorney
for
the
texas
optometric
association
will
be
presenting
the
facts
relevant
to
the
board
membership
statute
and
arguing
that,
that
statute
is
constitutional.
ms.
dorothy
prengler,
who
is
an
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
representing
the
board,
will
be
presenting
the
facts
concerning
the
assumed
name
statute
and
she
will
be
arguing
that,
that
statute
is
also
constitutional.
now,if
i
may
briefly
present
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
the
first
statute
as
i
mentioned,
which
is
an
issue
is
the
board
membership
statute.
it
requires
that
four
of
the
six
members
of
the
texas
optometry
board
shall
be
members
of
the
texas
optometric
association.
the
second
statute
is
the
assumed
name
statute.
it
provides
that
optometrists
in
texas
shall
practice
optometry
under
their
own
personal
names
and
may
not
practice
optometry
under
assumed
names
or
trade
names.
the
lawsuit
was
originally
filed
by
dr.
rogers,
who
was
one
the
six
members
of
the
state
board.
he
challenged
the
board
membership
statute,
as
an
arbitrary
classification
in
violation
of
his
equal
protection
rights,
his
due
process
rights,
and
most
recently
his
associational
rights.
he
also
challenged
the
assumed
name
statute
as
a
violation
of
his
rights
of
commercial
free
speech.
the
lower
court,
which
was
a
three
judge
court,
held
that
the
assumed
name
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
was
in
violation
of
commercial
free
speech,
concluding
that
their
decision
was
mandated
by
this
courtâ€™s
opinion
in
bates.
mr.
larry
niemann
your
honor,
the
texas
statutes
are
silent
regarding
the
group
practice
of
medicine.
i
would
point
out
that
it's
very
important
that
there
has
been
no
history
of
abuse,
and
there
is
distinction
between
the
group
practice
of
medicine
and
the
assumed
name
practice
of
optometry
and
i
will
expand
on
that
later
in
my
argument.
at
the
same
time,
the
court
held
that
the
assumed
name
statute
was
unconstitutional.
the
court
upheld
the
board
membership
statute,
reasoning
that
it
was
an
economic
regulation
law
that
the
rational
relationship
test
applied
and
that
the
state
legislature
did
have
ample
reason,
ample
justification
for
the
statute.
the
court
listed
three
specific
rationales
for
this
statute.
the
bottom
line
of
each
being
that
there
was
a
greater
likelihood
of
law
enforcement.
the
four
of
the
six
members
of
the
optometry
board
were
from
toa.
now
to
the
facts
which
are
specifically
relevant
to
the
board
membership
statute.
mr.
larry
niemann
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
unique
history
of
optometry
in
texas
is
what
the
lower
court
pointed
to
as
the
justification
for
the
board
membership
statute.
that
history
deals
with
commercial
optometrists,
historical
track
record
of
hostility
toward
enforcement
of
the
texas
optometry
law.
mr.
larry
niemann
he
cannot.
it
also
deals
not
only
with
the
track
record
of
non-law
enforcement
by
the
commercial
optometrists,
but
also
a
track
record
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
for
deception
and
consumer
abuse.
now
in
understanding
these
facts,
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
appreciate
that
in
texas,
there
are
two
separate
classifications
of
optometrists;
professional
optometrists
and
commercial
optometrists.
traditionally
--
mr.
larry
niemann
yes
your
honor,
i
think
they
could.
traditionally,
professional
optometrists
have
been
characterized
by
an
economic
independence
from
opticians.
they
have
been
characterized
by
their
practice
by
appointment
rather
than
a
waiting
line
method.
they
have
emphasized
quality
and
longer
and
more
thorough
examinations
of
the
patients
and
a
close
doctor
patient
relationship,
but
most
importantly
professional
optometrists
have
been
characterized
by
a
long
history
of
strong
law
enforcement
of
the
texas
optometry
laws.
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
professional
optometrists
or
rather
the
texas
optometric
association
is
composed
exclusively
of
professional
optometrists.
mr.
larry
niemann
the
law
was
enacted
by
the
legislature.
we
happen
to
agree
with
the
legislature
and
we
hold
a
philosophy
of
strongly
enforcing
the
mandates
of
the
legislature
your
honor.
mr.
larry
niemann
that's
correct.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
in
contrast,
all
the
commercial
optometrists
and
the
commercial
optometrists
have
been
characterized
by
high
volume,
high
speed
assumed
name
practices.
traditionally,
they
have
been
employed
with
or
associated
with
the
retail
optician
chain
stores.
they
have
been
subjected
to
highly
restrictive
employment
contracts,
economic
tie-in.
there
is
some
dispute
in
the
record
over
that
your
honor.
dr.
roger,
says
witness
is
to
say
that
there
are
lower
prices.
we
have
a
former
commercialist
himself,
then
owner
of
a
chain
who
had
stated
that
the
chain
store
operations
actually
under
some
circumstances
cause
an
increase
in
prices,
and
there
is
a
california
study
that
i
think
is
in
the
record
that
discounts,
the
long
standing
argument
that
a
commercial
adverting,
assumed
name
type
practice
actually
reduces
prices.
as
i
was
saying,
the
commercial
optometrists
were
characterized
historically
by
these
economic
tie-ins
and
controlled
by
opticians.
most
importantly,
commercial
optometrists
have
been
characterized
in
texas
by
repeated
history
of
hostility
toward
the
enforcement
of
the
texas
optometry
laws
on
the
books.now
in
the
record,
the
most
blatant
episode
of
optometry,
commercial
optometry's
hostility
toward
law
enforcement,
is
an
incident
which
occurred
in
1967,
the
year
immediately
preceding
the
legislature's
adoption
of
the
board
membership
statute.
during
that
year,
the
commercial
optometrists
held
the
majority
of
the
board.
they
immediately
proceeded
to
repeal
a
rule
called
the
professional
responsibility
rule.
now
that
rule
contains
some
very
important
provisions.
it
prevented
fee
splitting
between
optometrists
and
opticians.
it
prevented
tie-ins
and
kickbacks.
it
minimized
the
economic
control
by
opticians
over
optometrists.
it
required
optometrists
to
use
their
own
personal
names
and
prevented
them
from
using
assumed
names
or
names
at
offices
where
they
did
not
actually
practice.
that
professional
responsibility
rule
was
the
corner
stone
of
the
public's
protection
against
deception
and
abuse
in
optometry,
and
it
had
been
adopted
as
a
rule
by
the
board
to
correct
and
cure
some
long
standing
abuses
by
commercial
optometry.
now
as
soon
as
the
commercialist
on
the
board
attempted
to
repeal
this
rule,
the
legislature
reacted
very
strongly.
the
legislature
refused
to
confirm
the
appointments
of
the
commercialists
that
had
done
the
damage.
the
legislature
abolished
the
old
board,
created
a
new
board
and
mandated
that
four
of
the
six
members
be
from
toa.
and
the
legislature
went
even
further.
they
withdrew
all
rule
making
authority
from
the
board,
they
incorporated
the
professional
responsibility
rule
into
the
statute
and
assigned
the
task
of
enforcing
the
statute
to
the
board.
in
effect,
what
the
legislature
did
was
to
codify
into
statutory
form,
very
high
standards
of
professional
conduct;
standards
which
coincided
with
those
of
toa.
the
legislature
did
not
want
to
put
enforcement
of
these
very
high
standards
in
the
hands
of
the
commercial
optometrists
who
were
the
mortal
enemies
of
those
standards.
in
other
words
your
honor,
the
legislature
did
not
want
to
put
the
fox
in
charge
of
the
hyenas.
and
that
is
the
historical
background
of
the
board
membership
statute.
ms.
prengler
will
as
i
have
stated,
present
the
facts
relevant
to
the
assumed
name
statute.
now
to
the
legal
arguments
regarding
the
board
membership
statute;
i
would
like
to
rebut
in
sequence
each
of
the
four
separate
grounds
of
the
unconstitutionality
presented
by
dr.
rogers.
these
are
arbitrary
classification,
irrebuttable
presumption,
procedural
due
process
and
associational
rights.
turing
first
to
the
arbitrary
classification
argument;
dr.
rogers
has
argued
that
the
board
membership
statute
is
an
arbitrary
classification
of
optometrists
which
violates
his
equal
protection
rights.
mr.
larry
niemann
six.
mr.
larry
niemann
four
i
believe.
mr.
larry
niemann
staggered.
mr.
larry
niemann
by
appointment
of
the
governor
your
honor.
mr.
larry
niemann
let
me
add
another
step;
there
is
a
unitary
appointment,
which
must
be
confirmed
by
the
senate
which
meets
every
two
years,
and
they
serve
until
they
are
either
confirmed
or
unconfirmed
by
the
senate.
now
regarding
the
arbitrary
--
mr.
larry
niemann
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
a
vacancy
and
the
governor
--
mr.
larry
niemann
your
honor,
the
question
is
never
risen,
and
i
would
think
that
the
statutory
construction
of
that
law
would
require
his
continuing
membership
in
toa,
but
i
don't
know.
mr.
larry
niemann
your
honor,
i
really
don't
know.
the
statute
requires
that
the
board
consists
of
four
members
of
toa,
and
i
would
think
conclusively
that
would
require
their
membership
at
the
time
of
appointment.
i
would
presume
that
it
requires
continuing
membership,
and
resignation
or
ouster
from
toa
would
vacate
his
position.
now
regarding
arbitrary
classification,
dr.
rogers
argues
that
the
statute
is
arbitrary,
because
it
has
no
rational
basis.
we
disagree
and
the
lower
court
disagreed.
the
lower
court
concluded
conclusions
very
similar
to
the
facts
i
have
just
recited.
the
court
stated
that
the
three
rationales
where
the
toa
members
are
more
likely
to
be
economically
independent
than
non-toa
members.
the
toa
members
have
a
greater
likelihood
of
emphasizing
the
highest
quality
of
eye
care
as
compared
to
non-toa
members.
and
thirdly,
the
toa
members
are
more
profound
to
enforce
the
texas
optometry
act
than
non-toa
members.
i
believe
that
is
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
that
these
were
findings
of
fact.
it
is
our
position
that
the
bottom
line
of
all
these
regions
is
a
greater
likelihood
of
enforcement
of
the
optometry
laws.
we
do
submit
then
that
there
are
rational
basis
and
therefore
the
arbitrary
classification
argument
follows.
dr.
roger's
next
theory
is
that
the
board
membership
statute
violates
substantive
due
process
because
of
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
he
argues
that
the
legislative
classification
creates
or
triggers
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
a
non-toa
member
is
unfit
to
serve
on
the
board.
now
the
lower
court
we
believe
correctly
rejected
this
argument,
noting
that
an
irrebuttable
presumption
does
not
exist
in
this
case,
since
no
commercial
optometrist
is
conclusively
denied
membership
on
the
board.
commercial
optometry
is
not
prevented
from
sitting
on
the
board
in
those
two
spaces,
as
it's
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
dr.
rogers
himself
a
commercialist
over
20
years
has
been
a
continuing
member
of
the
board
during
that
period
of
time.
additionally,
we
would
submit
that
there
is
another
reason
why
the
irrebuttable
presumption
analysis
should
not
be
used.
we
believe
that
the
irrebuttable
presumption
test
appears
to
demand
legislative
perfection,
yet
nearly
all
legislative
classifications
on
economic
regulation
contained
some
degree
of
imperfection
and
inaccuracy.
indeed
very
few
acts
of
the
legislature
could
ever
survive
the
bottom
line
requirement
of
the
irrebuttable
presumption
test,
i
e
that
the
requirement
of
the
legislative
classification
be
an
accurate
yardstick,
to
implement
the
legislative
goals
100%
of
the
time.
dr.
roger's
next
theory
is
that
the
board
membership
statute
violates
procedural
due
process.
the
thrust
of
his
claim
here
is
that
the
present
and
the
future
toa
board
members
will
as
a
matter
of
law
always
be
prejudiced
against
commercial
optometrists
in
all
future
proceedings
in
all
situations.
he
argues
that
if
the
board
majority
consists
of
toa
members,
the
board
is
unconstitutional
per
se
for
all
purposes,
including
examination,
license
renewal,
and
disciplinary
actions.
we
submit
that
if
his
argument
were
to
be
correct,
the
present
texas
board
consisting
of
four
toa
members
would
be
unconstitutional
even
if
there
never
had
been
a
board
membership
statute.
in
other
words,
the
constitutionality
of
the
board
would
vary
from
year-to-year
depending
on
how
many
toa
members
were
appointed
to
the
board
by
the
governor,
and
we
don't
think
that
makes
sense.
the
lower
court
rejected
this
inherent
bias
analysis,
and
noted
that
bias
must
be
proven
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
it
cannot
be
legally
presumed
as
a
matter
of
law
as
an
inference
from
association
membership.
and
we
submit
that
bias
must
be
actually
proved
in
the
context
of
specific
parties
in
specific
hearings
that
are
pending
or
which
are
about
to
commence.
in
other
words,
proof
of
bias
in
a
hypothetical
future
adjudicatory
hearing
simply
does
not
allow
the
illegal
presumption
of
bias
in
all
conceivable
future
board
functions.
mr.
larry
niemann
apparently
there
it
might
be
construed
as
an
inconsistency
your
honor,
but
it
is
not.
the
first
argument
is
that
the
legislature
is
justified
in
concluding
the
toa
members
would
be
more
likely
to
enforce
the
law.
the
second
argument
here
is
that
the
judiciary
cannot
presume
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
there
will
be
prejudice
throughout
the
future.
one
deals
with
the
legislative
right
to
declare
a
reasonable
classification,
one
deals
with
the
prohibition
against
the
judiciary's
assumption
of
prejudice
in
the
future.
mr.
larry
niemann
in
the
future
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
legislature
can
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
larry
niemann
your
honor,
biased
toward
law
enforcement
is
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind.
the
bias
being
complained
about
by
dr.
rogers
is
pecuniary
bias,
not
bias
regarding
law
enforcement.
and
those
are
two
completely
different
animals.
i
think
the
legislature
can
presume
that
certain
persons
should
not
categorize
or
classifications
of
persons
will
be
biased
toward
law
enforcement
and
others
may
not.
particularly,
your
honor,
when
there
is
a
track
record
of
strong
hostility,
strong
bias
against
law
enforcement
which
has
been
exemplified
by
the
track
record
of
commercial
optometry
in
texas.
dr.
rogers'
final
theory
is
that
his
amendment
associational
rights
are
infringed.
i
would
comment
that
the
issue
is
not
raised
below
and
is
being
considered
for
the
first
time
by
this
court
on
appeal.
the
thrust
of
dr.
rogers'
argument
here
is
that
he
has
been
precluded
from
being
on
the
majority
of
the
board,
if
he
chooses
not
to
associate
with
toa.
it's
important
to
note
here
that
dr.
rogers
is
not
arguing
that
commercial
optometry
is
deprived
of
any
representation
on
the
board,
but
only
that
as
the
commercial
optometrist,
he
is
deprived
of
being
on
the
voting
majority
of
that
board.
mr.
larry
niemann
that's
correct
your
honor.
it's
another
distinction,
which
was
--
mr.
larry
niemann
that's
correct.
we
submit
the
dr.
rogers'
associational
rights
if
any
are
incidental
and
insignificant
here.
dr.
rogers
complaint
is
that
he
has
being
deprived
of
being
on
the
voting
majority
of
the
board
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
constitutional
provision,
which
guarantees
the
right
of
anybody
to
be
on
the
majority
side
of
any
vote,
be
it
in
a
political
election,
a
legislative
vote
or
an
optometry
board
vote.
mr.
larry
niemann
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
larry
niemann
your
honor,
i
might
point
out
that
--
mr.
larry
niemann
it
is
a
vote
deals
with
enforcing
the
law
and
the
four
members
of
the
toa
on
the
board
vote
to
enforce
the
law
and
dr.
rogers
votes
against
enforcing
the
law,
then
there
is
no
way
he
is
going
to
win.
mr.
larry
niemann
there
have
been
many
occasions
your
honor,
when
dr.
rogers
has
been
on
the
majority.
i
might
point
out
that
the
majority
here
is
not
a
--
mr.
larry
niemann
they
don't
get
along,
but
they
still
agree
on
some
things
your
honor,
and
in
the
way
of
license,
your
license
renewal,
and
enforcement
of
some
of
the
laws,
they
have
common
interests.
dr.
rogers
feels
very
strongly
about
enforcing
some
of
the
laws,
but
not
all
of
the
laws.
so
where
they
happen
to
agree
on
some
of
the
laws
then
they
will
be
voting
together
as
a
majority.
mr.
larry
niemann
your
honor,
i
might
ask.
mr.
larry
niemann
yes,
you
are,
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
that
a
minority
always
has
the
right
to
be
in
the
majority.
consider
for
a
moment,
a
board
of
health
consisting
of
various
members
from
different
professions
and
businesses,
a
physician,
an
optometrist,
a
dentist,
a
hospital
administrator,
or
a
nursing
home
administrator.
none
of
these
--
no
one
person
on
the
board
would
have
his
specialty
interest
view
point
represented
by
the
majority
of
the
board,
but
the
fact
that
they
are
in
a
minority
so
to
speak
from
their
specialty
interest
view
point,
does
not
make
that
board
unconstitutional.
if
it
were,
we
would
need
to
consider
the
unconstitutionality
of
thousands
of
boards
across
the
country.
mr.
larry
niemann
he
gets
out
of
voting
your
honor
because
of
his
philosophy
of
non-enforcement
and
his
opposition
to
the
anti-commercial
optometry
provisions
of
the
act.
for
these
reasons
--
mr.
larry
niemann
no,
your
honor,
this
is
a
case
to
first
impression.
mr.
larry
niemann
no
there
are
no
other
federal
cases
your
honor.
there
is
a
host
of
other
cases,
state
court
cases,
in
which
board
memberships
have
been
tied
to
associational
qualifications,
they
have
been
invariably
upheld
by
the
states
throughout
the
country,
but
no
federal
cases
your
honor.
for
those
reasons
--
mr.
larry
niemann
no
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
provision
that
impliedly
prevents
the
delegation
of
congressional
powers
to
an
association.
i
would
point
out
however
that
there
is
no
constitutional
provision
that
prevents
the
states
from
delegating
such
a
power
to
private
associations
and
that
is
a
very
distinctive
difference.
mr.
larry
niemann
your
honor,
if
i
may
summarize
them
by
referring
back
to
my
statement
of
fact.
they
are
generally
reflected
in
the
professional
responsibility
rule
and
that
rule
prevents
fee
splitting
between
optometrists,
it
prevents
the
economic
control,
the
economic
tie-ins,
the
kickbacks.
mr.
larry
niemann
those
are
statutory
provisions.
if
i
might
refresh
our
memory,
they
were
at
one
time
a
regulation
adopted
by
the
board,
then
when
the
commercialists
got
in
control,
they
were
repealed
and
then
they
were
enacted
by
statute
and
the
legislature
wanted
them
stick.
