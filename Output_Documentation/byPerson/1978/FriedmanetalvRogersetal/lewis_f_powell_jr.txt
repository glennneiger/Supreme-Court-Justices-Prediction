justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
texas
law
generally
with
respect
to
trade
names
and
trade
marks.
i
suppose
you
have
a
statute
comparable
to
that
in
many
if
not
all
states
providing
for
the
registration
of
trade
names
and
trade
marks.
do
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now
i
realize
under
your
current
law,
you
couldn't
write
just
the
trade
name,
you
are
talking
of
that.
but
let's
assume
you
have
a
registered
trade
name
or
trade
mark
in
texas,
may
it
be
sold,
transferred
or
signed,
is
it
regarded
as
an
item
of
property?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
usually
is.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
there
any
cases
in
texas
that
deal
with
this
so
for
as
you
know?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
wonder
why
you
don't
argue
that
a
trade
name
is
property
and
not
speech.
if
a
trade
name
acquires
a
secondary
meaning,
no
one
else
can
take
it
away
from
you.
well,
you
have
answered
my
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
keith,
you
mention
a
carp
case.
in
that
case,
the
fact
that
i
recalled
in,
dr.
carp
operated
71
offices
around
the
state
and
used
ten
different
trade
names.
under
the
new
statute,
may
one
operate
under
a
different
trade
name
in
each
community
if
he
wishes
to?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
dr.
carp
still
in
business?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
dr.
rogers
operated
under
the
same
name
all
over
the
state?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
could
he
operate
under
ten
different
names?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
carp
case,
dr.
carp
operated
three
offices
in
one
city
within
two
blocks
of
each
other,
each
under
a
different
name,
with
the
same
man
supervising
them.
is
that
still
possible
under
texas
law,
assuming
you
win
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
question
might
be
whether
or
not
it's
inherently
deceptive?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
carp
case,
the
optometrist
as
i
understood
it,
can
circulate
among
the
71
offices,
so
that
the
one
who
served
you
today
might
be
in
an
entirely
different
city
next
month.
is
that
--
do
you
see
any
opportunity
in
that
sort
of
a
situation
for
deceiving
or
misleading
the
public
as
to
who
will
be
available
to
serve
them.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
certainly.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
quite
buy
the
trade
name?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
mean
you
can't
buy
a
trade
name
in
texas.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
most
of
dr.
carp's
names
didn't
have
the
name
of
any
individual,
i
recall
one,
maybe
i
am
wrong.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
luck
cutraid
optical
or
with
that
effect,
luck,
one
price
optical,
could
you
sell
that
trade
name
in
texas
together
with
the
business
associated
with
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
the
general
law
around
the
country,
as
i
have
understood
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
book
is
supposed
to
convey
information
forthwith.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
trade
name
conveys
information,
meaningful
information
if
its
merely
a
trade
name
rather
than
the
name
of
a
doctor
only
after
it
acquires
a
secondary
meaning.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that
may
be
years.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
sure
that
is
right,
i
was
not
thinking
about
dr.
rogers,
i
was
just
generalizing
about
the
defect
of
that
statute.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
keith,
you
mentioned
the
federal
trade
commission
regulation,
do
you
think
that
has
any
bearing
on
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
and
cross-appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
texas.
the
district
court
invalidated
a
section
of
the
texas
optometry
act
that
prohibited
the
practice
of
optometry
under
a
trade
name.
it
held
that
the
restriction
violated
first
amendment
rights
of
commercial
speech.
the
court
rejected
however
a
due
process
attack
on
another
section
of
the
act
requiring
that
three
of
the
five
members
of
the
texas
optometry
board
be
drawn
for
membership
of
a
particular
professional
organization.
in
recent
decisions,
this
court
has
recognized
that
commercial
speech
enjoys
a
measure
of
first
amendment
protection.
but
the
court
also
has
emphasized
that
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
commercial
speech
make
it
permissible
for
a
state
to
regulate
such
speech
in
a
manner
that
would
not
be
appropriate
for
other
forms
of
speech.
we
think
that
the
texas
prohibition
of
the
practice
of
optometry
under
a
trade
name
is
an
example
of
permissible
regulation.
the
prohibition,
the
possibilities
for
abuse
and
deception
attended
upon
issues
of
trade
names
where
viewed
as
serious
by
the
texas
legislature.
the
record
in
this
case
includes
a
number
of
examples
of
such
abuse.
the
texas
restriction
is
addressed
primarily
to
the
problems
of
false
and
misleading
information
and
has
only
a
most
limited
effect
on
information
that
can
be
conveyed
to
consumers.
since
we
conclude
that
the
texas
law
is
a
legitimate
exercise
of
state
authority,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
the
texas
legislature
also
acted
lawfully
in
requiring
that
a
majority
of
the
state's
regulatory
board
be
drawn
from
members
of
a
professional
organization,
an
organization
that
had
standards
consistent
with
the
rules
committed
by
the
legislature
to
the
board
to
enforce.
we
therefore
affirm
the
court's
decision
sustaining
that
provision.
mr.
justice
blackmun
with
whom
mr.
justice
marshall
joined
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
with
respect
to
the
membership
requirement
but
dissenting
from
the
decision
with
respect
to
the
trade
name.
