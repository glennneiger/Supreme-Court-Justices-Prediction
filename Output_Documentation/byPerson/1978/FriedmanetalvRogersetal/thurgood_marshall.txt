justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
that
legislative
group
agreed
a
group
of
prejudice
but
the
court
can't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
there
a
general
rule
that
you
can
be
excluded.
as
i
understand,
there
is
no
way
for
dr.
rogers
to
win.
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
when
a
vote
is
taken
on
a
board,
there
is
the
no
way
for
dr.
rogers
to
win.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
true
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
not
my
question.
my
question
was
can
you
show
a
time
that
dr.
rogers
won
the
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
these
people
just
don't
get
along
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
being
a
minority
of
two
or
one,
or
being
a
minority
of
89.
if
you
are
in
the
minority,
you
are
“
in
the
minority”.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
how
many
coordinates
you
say
that
he
has
all
the
rights
and
everything,
but
he
just
gets
out
of
voting.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
allocation
(inaudible)
nowhere?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
you
used
to
take
a
(inaudible)
and
put
in
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
worries
me
is
how
much
more
information
does
an
individual
in
a
large
city
like
big
d
like
dallas
get
from
the
name
nj
rogers
or
the
rogers
optometric
corporation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
it
is
i
mean
they
don't
know
mr.
rogers
from
far
back,
do
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
can
checkout
the
company
too
with
friends
and
acquaintances?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don't
know
how
many
people
nj
rogers
are
perceiving
to
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
normally
these
people
are
practiced
as
individuals.
in
this
day
and
age,
they
least
have
a
nurse,
you
don't
know
who
a
nurse
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
or
you
don't
know
the
technician
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
don't
know?
so
i
guess
it's
the
numbers,
the
more
if
you
don't
know,
the
worse
off
you
are.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose,
you
put
out
on
your
door
everybody
that
worked
in
there.
on
the
name,
everybody;
joe
docks
toilet
cleaner,
sam
brown
floor
sweeper,
would
that
be
alright?
suppose
you
that
put
in
your
advertisement.
you
are
putting
everybody
that
worked
in
that
firm's
name.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
with
this
i
am
true
at
this.
this
company
optometrist
where
you
would
not
call
it
optometric
country
says
that
we
have
the
following
people
practicing
in
this
office;
a,
b,
c,
d
four
names
in
the
advertisement,
would
not
that
be
sufficient
information?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
will
be
qualified
under
your
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
get
a
direct
answer.
you
say
they
can
be
required
to
list
all
of
the
names?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
if
they
could
be,
you
say
it
would
be
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
that
mean
all
other
names
of
all
of
the
offices
on
all
of
the
office
doors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
it
oppressive
burden
of
speech?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question.
could
the
state
require
it
or
not?
you
just
slip
right
over,
this
wouldn't
be
alright.
i
did
not
think
you
meant
it
then,
and
i
know
you
do
not
mean
it
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
he
can
put
on
the
prescription?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
he
had
to
put
his
own
name
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
he
had
to
put
his
own
name.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
my
question.
he
can
just
put
texas
optical
but
he
is
got
to
put
the
name
of
the
person
who
did
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
dr.
rogers
didn't
--
dr.
rogers
did
not
sign
all
of
those
prescriptions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
when
he
made
that
advertisement,
then
the
people
get
idea
that
he
will.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
record
shows
that
all
65
are
equally
graded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
can
say
that
two
doctors
are
equal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
optometrists.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
there
anyway
in
the
world
that
those
100
could
be
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
100
different
reasons
with
100
different
offices
operating
in
65
different
places
under
65
different
circumstances.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
in
all
64
of
these
offices?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
have
64?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
lot
of
difference
between
having
dyspepsia
and
going
blind.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
couldn't
protect
myself
in
private
practice
from
being
called
a
freebie
lawyer,
but
that
is
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
the
state
statutes
that
says
that
three
members
of
the
commission
must
be
appointed
from
the
opposite
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
texas.
texas
pays
a
law
and
says
that
and
i
think
this
is
done
in
most
states,
it
is
done
in
federal
government,
is
it
not?m
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
on
this
commission,
there
have
been
so
many
members
of
the
opposite
party.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
so,
they
don't
say
what.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
may
you
know
it
is
a
fact
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
nobody
is
objected
to
design
level
