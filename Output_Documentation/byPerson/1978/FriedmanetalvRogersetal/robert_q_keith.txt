mr.
robert
q.
keith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
trade
name
in
fact
communicates
a
bundle
of
valuable
information
to
the
consumer
and
respectfully
the
suppression
of
the
trade
name
is
the
suppression
of
speech,
not
the
regulation
of
conduct.
this
was
the
holding
of
the
district
court
in
this
particular
case
and
they
relied
very
heavily
and
applied
virginia
pharmacy
and
bates
to
the
facts
of
our
case.
and
the
court
will
bear
in
mind
that
there
were
two
issues
that
are
related
to
this
discussion.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct.
there
is
integrity.
there
is
this
bundle
of
services
that
are
available
that
through
the
years
and
in
this
instance,
dr.
rogers
has
lived
mabank,
texas.
he
has
operated
with
his
brother
and
with
others
for
39
years.
he
has
practiced
under
the
trade
name
texas
state
optical.
he
has
developed
a
reputation,
a
goodwill,
there
is
communicated
between
him
and
members
of
the
public
a
substantial
body
of
information,
much
as
you
would
say
with
respect
to
the
mayo
clinic.
you
might
take
out
an
ad
in
the
new
york
times
and
describe
all
of
the
accomplishments
of
this
professional
members
associated
with
the
mayo
clinic,
and
you
would
not
even
then
convey
to
me
or
to
the
ordinary
member
of
the
public
the
quality
of
medical
care,
the
integrity,
the
attention,
and
devotion
to
that
service.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
your
honor
and
the
court
spoke
specifically
to
that
court
in
the
pittsburgh
press
case.
the
underlying
activity
that
here
is
murder
for
hire
is
illegal.
thus
the
state
may
suppress
the
advertising
of
that
illegal
activity.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that's
the
argument,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that's
correct
but
the
underlying
activity
that
here
is
the
practice
of
optometry
is
legal.
what
is
made
legal
is
the
mere
advertisement
of
the
name
in
association
with
the
practice.
so
the
only
illegal
activity
under
state
law
is
the
communication
of
the
name,
it's
not
the
underlying
practice
itself.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
had
asked
the
question
if
i
may
respond
to,
isn't
this
much
likely
full
disclosure
requirements
of
the
securities
exchange
commission?
may
i
answer
that
question?
mr.
robert
q.
keith
in
this
way,
dr.
rogers
practices
under
the
trade
name
texas
state
optical.
he
communicates
to
the
public
this
bundle
of
information
that
is
of
value
and
interest
to
the
consumer.
furthermore,
the
evidence
shows
that
in
each
of
his
offices;
let
us
say
there
is
a
dr.
fahey
who
is
the
optometrist
present.
dr.
fahey's
name
is
on
the
door;
dr.
richard
fahey,
optometrist.
that's
factual.
the
statute
further
requires
that
if
dr.
fahey
is
present,
his
license
must
be
conspicuously
displayed
in
his
office,
so
that
if
you
or
any
other
member
of
the
public
goes
to
the
office,
we
find
that
there
is
in
fact
dr.
fahey
and
what
his
license
number
and
registration
is.
his
license
must
be
registered
in
the
county
of
his
residence.
finally,
when
he
completes
a
state
statute
prescribed
examination
and
the
statute
in
this
instance
even
prescribes
a
test
that
must
be
performed
for
visual
examination.
once
he
has
completed
the
examination
and
writes
a
prescription,
he
must
sign
that
prescription
with
his
own
name.
thus
you
see
that
there
is
three
in
this
office;
there
are
three
classic
instances;
there
is
a
name
on
the
door,
the
license
on
the
wall,
and
the
signatory
on
the
prescription,
all
of
which
are
disclosed
to
the
patient
and
in
addition,
they
are
to
–
that
is
disclosed
to
the
patient,
the
fact
that
he
is
in
association
with
these
others
in
the
practice
of
optometry
and
that
he
provides
this
bundle
of
services
that
this
name
has
come
to
convey.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
well
sir,
we
have
made
full
disclosure
and
let's
put
that
to
rest.
now,
as
you
get
to
the
subject
of
quote
misleading,
there
are
at
least
three
responses
to
that.
to
begin
with,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court
and
this
was
a
three-judge
district
court,
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
it
appears
at
footnote
4
of
the
court's
opinion
that
the
use
of
the
trade
name
texas
state
optical
was
not
misleading.
secondly,
--
and
if
this
takes
a
little
explanation.
secondly,
the
carp
case
and
that
is
the
case
relied
upon
by
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
the
court
will
realize
that
that
case
was
tried
in
dallas
in
the
fall
of
1963,
some
15
years
ago.
the
particular
act
in
question
here
was
not
adopted
and
did
not
become
effective
until
september
1,
1969.
the
new
act
and
it
is
a
comprehensive
close
regulation
of
optometry
and
i
can
go
through
it
if
the
court
finds
necessary.
the
new
act
prescribed
a
variety
of
ways
of
eliminating
and
precluding
fraud,
misrepresentation,
for
optometric
practices
and
the
like.
the
act
specifically
speaks
to
misrepresentation.
now,
when
the
act
was
adopted,
it
suppressed
a
blanket
suppression
of
the
use
of
the
trade
name.
however,
it
provided
an
exemption
or
a
grandfather
clause
that
extends
in
part
until
january
1,
1979.
so,
dr.
rogers
in
some
offices
has
been
exempt
from
the
trade
name
provision
of
the
statute,
not
in
all
offices
but
in
some
instances.
he
has
operated
under
the
new
act
which
prevents
and
effectively
prevents
any
type
of
misrepresentation.
he
has
operated
under
the
new
act
for
eight
years.
he
has
operated
65
offices
in
texas
under
the
new
act.
at
the
time
of
this
judgment,
it
was
rendered
by
the
district
court.
there
is
not
one
line
of
testimony.
there
is
not
one
witness.
there
is
not
even
one
affidavit.
there
is
not
one
suggestion
of
fact
of
any
deception,
fraud,
misrepresentation,
dissimilation,
confusion,
or
the
alike.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
this
is
respectfully
your
honor,
a
regulation
of
speech
and
not
of
conduct.
the
state
of
texas
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
the
example
to
counsel.
the
state
of
texas
did
not
say,
it
could
have
said,
you
can
only
own
one
optometric
office,
or
you
can
only
own
three
optometric
offices.
it
did
not
choose
to
do
so.
the
state
could
have
said,
‘you
cannot
employ
another
optometrist.
the
state
did
not
choose
to
do
so.
instead,
the
state
specifically
said,
you
may
employ
other
optometrists.
the
state
could
have
said,
you
may
perform
only
x
number
of
examinations
per
day.
the
state
could
say,
you
may
not
practice
for
all
deceit
or
misrepresentation
in
the
practice.
the
state
said
that
and
the
evidence
shows
that
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
evidence
of
any
fraud,
misrepresentation,
or
deception
although
they
have
been
operated
by
a
plaintiff
in
this
case,
65
offices
for
8
years.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
the
substantive
provision
would
be
business
conduct,
and
the
state
could
otherwise
regulate
business
conduct
without
stamping
out
all
element
of
speech
and
that
is
what
the
state
has
chosen
to
do.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
when
it
reaches
the
first
amendment
question,
then
the
state
must
choose
the
least
restrictive
alternative
and
in
this
instance,
as
the
evidence
shows
there
are
available
to
the
state
a
number
of
other
alternatives
that
do
not
suppress
truthful,
legitimate
use
of
the
trade
name.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
your
honor
–
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
he
is
not.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
unless
such
practice
and
i
think
this
is
the
key;
unless
such
practice
constituting
some
type
of
fraud,
deception
or
misrepresentation.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
it
would
be
possible
unless
your
honor
there
were
some
type
of
fraud
or
deception,
then
the
statute
speaks,
and
if
that
becomes
deceptive,
then
he
cannot.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
and
if
it
is
inherently
deceptive,
then
the
optometry
act
specifically
prevents
it
and
texas
also
has
another
general
and
very
strong
consumer
protection
and
deceptive
trade
practice
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
respectfully
sir,
that
is
still
possible
today,
under
justice
white's
example,
where
one
man
employed
20
optometrists.
under
texas
law,
one
man
was
–
excuse
me,
let
me
go
back
an
example.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
answering
the
court's
question
with
respect
to
carp.
carp
would
not
only
--
carp
would
go
in
and
buy
an
optometrist
out
and
then
he
would
–
mr.
robert
q.
keith
he
would
buy
up
mr.
johns
and
then
he
would
claim
to
use
the
name
john's
optical,
then
he
would
buy
up
dr.
smith
and
he
would
claim
to
use
the
name
dr.
smith
and
these
two
offices
would
be
two
blocks
apart.
under
texas
law,
this
is
not
permissible.
however
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
you
can
buy
an
optometric
practice,
but
you
can
operate
in
office
but
you
cannot
operate
it
under
someone
else's
name.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
luck
optical.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
under
the
general
law
of
texas,
the
trade
name
is
an
item
of
property
that
can
be
conveyed.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
now
you
had
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago
that
since
the
trade
name
is
property,
why
doesn't
the
state
argue
that
it
is
property
rather
than
speech.
may
i
respond
to
that
in
this
way.
a
book
or
a
newspaper
is
property
but
it
is
also
the
highest
form
of
speech.
while
the
trade
name
itself,
while
i
might
own
or
develop
a
property
interest
in
the
trade
name.
what
the
statute
prohibits
is
not
there,
not
the
property
interest,
the
statute
prohibits
the
use
of
the
trade
name,
the
exhibition.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
true
but
in
this
instance
of
the
plaintiff,
in
this
case,
he
has
acquired
that
secondary
meaning
after
39
years
of
the
highest
form
of
quality
service
and
integrity.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
i
appreciate
that,
but
the
trade
name
and
the
court
has
recognized
it
does
convey
valuable
information
and
the
facts
dr.
benham's
testimony
in
this
case
reflects
the
same
example.
if
i
may
turn
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
if
there
were
illegitimate
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
i
believe
the
state
could
adopt
that
rule.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
that's
where
the
ruler
runs
afoul
of
the
first
amendment.
now
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct
sir
because
the
trade
name
and
the
use
of
the
trade
name
conveys
valuable
information.
now,
i
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
as
this
court
has
said
to
practice
law
or
to
practice
optometry
but
the
state
cannot
impose
an
absolute
ban
on
my
expression
under
the
guise
of
professional
regulation.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
it
conveys
information
with
respect
to
integrity,
quality
of
service,
price,
convenience,
availability,
hours
of
service,
length
of
service
to
the
community,
your
grandmother
and
my
aunt
and
our
next
door
neighbor.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
as
justice
powell
indicated,
the
trade
name
would
convey
this
information
after
the
public
had
become
--
had
come
to
associate
with
it.
in
the
first
day
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
in
the
course
of
time
but
the
trial
court
here
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
this
trade
name
had
developed
the
association.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
and
that
would
be
true
whether
that
service
was
good
or
bad,
it
would
convey
in
a
word
quickly
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
let
us
say
for
example
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
if
the
court
mafia
were
to
come
in
and
take
over
and
you
are
just
another
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
then
immediately
that
trade
name
would
begin
to
connote
lousy
service,
poor
integrity,
poor
quality.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
mr.
justice,
while
the
state
of
texas
could
simply
say
that
in
the
practice
of
optometry,
you
cannot
change
ownership
of
a
trade
name
period,
that
would
be
a
permissible
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
or
that
it
is
not
subject
to
being
conveyed.
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
the
present
provision
and
that
is
the
provision
--
that
is
a
part
of
the
prohibition,
the
blanket
suppression
of
the
use
of
the
trade
name
and
that's
what
the
texas
court
struck
down.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
respectively
sir,
it
is
not
a
substantive
regulation,
it
is
a
suppression
of
speech
because
the
very
use
of
a
trade
name.
and
that's
what
the
statute
says,
the
optometrists
may
not
use
the
trade
name
and
the
use
of
the
trade
name
is
what
communicates
the
valuable
information
to
the
consumer.
so
the
state
has
said,
you
may
not
communicate
to
the
consumer
this
information.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir.
if
it
has
a
tendency
to
deceive,
the
sec
can
restrict
it,
the
texas
statute
restricts
it
and
we
accept
that
and
do
not
challenge
it.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
well,
not
necessarily
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
the
state
can
deal
with
the
subject
of
deception
without
prophylactically
abolishing
all
speech.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
only
the
state
could
prevent
him
from
using
any
type
of
deceptive
name.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
if
they
were
deceptive
and
in
this
instance,
the
trail
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
this
is
not
a
misleading
or
a
deceptive
name.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
but
it
is
required
to
make
a
finding
of
fact
just
to
whether
or
not
this
question,
this
use
is
or
is
not
misleading.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
because
if
it
were
misleading,
then
there
would
be
no
impermissible
infringement
on
speech
because
the
court
has
held
that
the
state
can
suppress
misleading
speech.
so
the
district
court
must
determine,
is
this
truthful
or
is
it
misleading.
if
it
is
misleading,
then
you
do
not
have
the
same
free
speech
right
that
you
have
if
it
is
truthful
and
that's
the
reason
to
finding
a
fact
is
required
to
be
made
by
the
court
yesterday.
the
state
speaks
and
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
purported
justifications
for
this
absolute
suppression
and
weigh
them
respectfully
against
the
consequences
or
the
harm
that
falls
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
and
prohibit
as
you
suggest
respectively
sir,
and
prohibit
the
transfer
of
that
name
in
the
practice
of
a
profession.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
i
think
they
can
make
them
put
the
name
on
the
door
as
well.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
if
that
becomes
necessary,
they
can,
but
that
is
not
what
they
have
done
mr.
justice
white.
what
they
have
done,
they
said
you
cannot
rather
than
you
must
and
there
is
a
substantial
difference
in
the
area
of
speech.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
it
would
be.
for
example,
my
client
could
not
with
his
brother
and
three
others,
list
their
names
and
say
associated
in
the
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
indeed
because
the
trade
name
is
valuable,
it
has
a
substantial
communicative
value
and
thus
is
of
substantial
value
to
my
client.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir.
if
the
people
are
different
and
if
the
stock
operator
as
you
described,
this
optometrist
has
come
in,
the
state
could
require
that
before
he
adopt
that
name,
he
must
meet
certain
standards
or
tests
or
not
even
at
all
purchase
the
name,
but
that
is
not
what
the
state
has
done
here,
they
just
made
an
absolute
suppression.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
they
are
not
presently
required
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
my
belief,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
if
there
were
some
interest
of
the
state
to
be
served
by
such
and
this
did
not
become
an
oppressive
burden
to
speech,
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
if
i
am
required
to
list
200
names
on
a
letterhead,
that
would
become
oppressive
because
it
could
not
write
anything
else
on
the
paper
and
thus
it
would
constitute
i
think
an
impingement
of
speech,
but
the
state
has
not
done
that.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
i
believe
the
state
can
require
until
it
becomes
an
oppressive
burden
and
effectively
deny
a
speech,
and
that
is
my
intellectually
honest
belief
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
until
it
constitutes
a
denial
of
speech.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
and
i
made
the
identical
disclosure
to
this
court
that
dr.
rogers
makes
to
his
patient.
i
have
my
firm
name
on
the
brief.
dr.
rogers
has
his
firm
name
texas
state
optical
on
his
door
or
on
his
stationary.
likewise,
i
have
personally
signed
the
brief,
the
optometrist
personally
signs
the
prescription.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
would
be
done
in
the
name
of
texas
state
optical,
yes
sir
and
in
his
trade
name.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
he
can
put
that
on
the
prescription
and
it
is
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
he
can
put
his
own
name
on
there
as
well.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
he
must
put
his
own
name
on
the
prescription.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
he
has
got
to
sign
his
own
name,
just
as
i
sign
my
own
name
to
the
briefs
in
this
court,
but
legitimately
under
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
no
sir,
the
man
who
perform
the
examination
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
because
he
does
not
hold
out
to
the
public
that
he
is
present
and
he
is
performing
the
examination.
he
merely
list
the
name
texas
state
optical.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
he
may
not
hold
himself
out
as
practicing
in
that
office
and
that
may
be
different.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
because
in
the
case
of
dr.
carp,
there
was
a
suggestion
that
some
type
of
misrepresentation
arose.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
we
do
not
challenge
any
effort
by
the
state
to
restrict
or
circumscribe
deceit
or
fraud
or
misrepresentation
at
all.
it
is
the
absolute
ban
against
truthful
speech
that
we
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
there
is
a
higher
right,
because
he
is
in
association
with
others
and
they
have
developed
as
justice
powell
suggested
a
secondary
meaning
of
goodwill
and
reputation
attended
to
a
high
quality
of
service
through
many,
many
years.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
it
might
but
he
has
been
at
this
for
39
years
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
start
over
and
acquire
the
same
reputational
interest
and
goodwill
in
any
reasonable
period
of
time
and
it
is
this
interest
which
is
not
only
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
it
is
a
property
interest,
the
reputation
and
goodwill.
the
consequences
of
this
ban,
not
to
mention
the
purely
theoretical
first
amendment
consequences,
but
the
immediate
and
direct
consequences
of
this
ban
are
testified
to
by
dr.
benham
in
this
court
and
in
the
federal
trade
commission
have
both
cited
as
authority.
one
is
that
since
there
is
less
information
and
that
is
dr.
benham's
testimony,
this
results
in
higher
cost
and
consequently
less
use.
as
this
court
said
in
virginia
pharmacy
and
as
dr.
benham
testified,
the
moment
the
price
goes
up,
the
consequences
fall
heaviest
on
those
who
need
glasses
the
most;
that
is
the
ill,
the
aged,
and
the
economically
depressed.
as
a
result,
fewer
people
are
able
to
obtain
the
services
or
goods
that
they
need.
as
a
consequence
then
in
the
aggregate
throughout
the
country
or
throughout
a
large
state
of
texas,
you
have
a
lower
degree
or
quality
of
care.
society
and
the
free
enterprise
system
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
suffer
substantially
because
our
free
enterprise
system
depends
on
an
intelligent
private
economic
decision.
once
you
constrain
information
as
this
court
and
as
dr.
benham
has
testified,
once
you
constrain
this
information,
this
results
in
what
the
court
has
called
a
misallocation
of
resources,
which
then
weakens
in
turn
our
free
enterprise
system,
which
is
based
on
full
disclosure
respectfully
rather
than
less
information.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
respectfully
i
do
not
sir.
neither
party
has
suggested
that
it
is
mooted
by
the
federal
trade
commission
order
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
and
if
those
facts
occurred
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
the
trade
name
does
not
guarantee
human
inviolability.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct,
but
it
does
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
it
does
represent
that
this
bundle
of
services
is
available
and
if
this
constitutes
a
misrepresentation,
then
the
state
has
another
statute,
it
does
not
need
to
rely
on
the
trade
name
ban,
it
has
another
statute
to
preclude
and
suppress
that
misrepresentation.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
it
is
the
entire
bundle
of
information.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
which
factually
your
honor
under
this
record
is
true
except
with
respect
may
be
to
the
enthusiasm
which
one
or
another
professional
may
apply
to
his
work
in
any
given
day.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
rather
your
honor,
the
record
is
absolutely
silent,
the
record
says
that
these
offices
all
operate
in
this
manner
and
there
is
no
suggestion
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir
and
the
record
does
not
suggest
such.
i
am
saying
if
the
offices
are
all
operated
--
i
would
think
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
i
would
think
substantially
100.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
but
at
the
same
time
your
honor
neither
could
every
associate
or
every
lawyer
at
covington
&
burling,
be
the
same
but
the
use
of
the
name
cromball
&
solomon
(ph)
or
covington
&
burling
does
convey
to
the
listener
a
reputation
for
integrity,
ability,
industry,
service
to
the
client.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
and
not
in
any
one
of
the
offices
are
both
lawyers
of
the
same
industry
ability
and
integrity
but
as
a
whole
the
trade
name
conveys
valuable
information
with
respect
to
that
firm.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
but
and
that
is
true
and
the
state
has
very
carefully
and
very
closely
regulated
the
optometrist
in
his
professional
functions
to
make
certain
that
he
does
provide
a
minimum
standard
of
care.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
your
honor,
could
i
state
it
differently,
if
my
firm
wanted
to
practice
under
the
name
“big
judgments”
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir
because
i
think
that
represents
some
type
of
puffing
that
and
some
type
of
deceit
associated
with
puffing.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
would
be
more
appropriate,
yes
sir.
i
think
that
likewise
would
tend
to
mislead.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
because
that
involves
the
essential
element
of
communication
of
speech
and
so
long
as
it
is
non-deceptive,
then
it
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
guarantee.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
may
i
turn
your
honor
respectfully
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
equal
protection
raised
in
the
matter
of
board
appointment.
the
reason
that
dr.
rogers
is
not
eligible
for
membership
in
the
toa
is
because
dr.
rogers
exercises
and
claims
the
right
to
exercise
his
first
amendment
rights.
that
is
why
he
is
not
eligible
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
code
of
ethics
of
the
texas
optometric
association
prescribed.
it
precluded
membership
to
anyone
who
advertises
price,
it
precluded
membership
to
anyone
who
used
a
trade
name
and
it
precluded
membership
to
anyone
who
operated
more
than
three
offices.
he
applied,
he
was
not
eligible
and
he
was
disqualified
from
the
membership.
he
was
disqualified
because
of
the
expression
of
his
fundamental
first
amendment
right,
whether
you
call
that
the
‘right
of
speech
or
the
right
of
association'.
the
case
becomes
much
like
that
of
turner
v.
fouche,
decided
by
this
court
in
1970.
there
the
georgia
statute
required
that
to
be
appointed
to
a
school
board,
a
person
had
to
be
a
free
holder.
the
court
recognized
that
none
of
us
and
certainly
dr.
rogers
recognizes
that
none
of
us
have
a
right
to
be
considered
for
public
service.
however
none
of
us
have
a
constitutional
right
to
be
appointed,
but
we
do
have
a
right
to
be
considered
for
public
service
without
an
invidious
discriminatory
disqualification.
and
the
state
may
not
deny
to
some
the
privilege
of
holding
office
that
extends
to
others
on
a
basis
that
violates
constitutional
guarantee
and
that's
exactly
what
the
state
has
done
in
this
instance.
they
have
said
that
because
you
exercise
your
first
amendment
right,
there
are
four
of
six
seats
on
that
board
that
you
are
not
eligible
to
be
appointed
to
and
that
is
plainly
and
simply
the
argument
made.
there
is
respectfully
no
rational
or
legitimate
reason
for
this
regulation
as
colloquy
with
mr.
neman(ph)
suggested.
if
you
presume
bias
against
law
enforcement
by
dr.
rogers
and
certainly
there
is
no
evidence
of
such
in
this
case,
that
would
be
just
like
presuming
bias
to
the
solicitor
general
to
say
that
he
could
not
fairly
sit
and
serve
as
a
judge.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
if
that
became
a
pattern
or
practice
that
became
state
policy,
i
think
so.
if
it
were
a
single
instance
where
the
incoming
governor
says,
i
am
going
to
pay
political
debt
to
this
organization
and
i
am
going
to
appoint
four
members
of
that
organization
to
the
board,
i
think
not.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
sir,
i
do
not
until
it
became
a
policy
that
was
discriminatory
because
of
the
exercise
of
a
fundamental
interest
such
as
free
speech.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
or
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
the
equivalent
of
state
law,
thank
you.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
the
federal
power
commission
regulation
under
federal
law
and
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
but
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
and
the
purpose
there
is
to
achieve
a
legitimate
balance.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir
and
i
do
not
know
those
cases
frankly.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
i
do
know
what
is
the
fact.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
i
am
not
aware
of
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
that
respect.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
because
in
this
instance,
i
am
excluded
from
consideration
because
i
have
exercised
this
fundamental
right.
i
am
placed
in
a
separate
distinct
category.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes
sir,
but
in
the
course
of
--
we
are
not
speaking
about
just
one
appointment,
we
are
now
speaking
about
the
course
or
let
us
say
three
appointments
or
four
appointments.
i
would
then
have
equal
opportunity
to
belong
or
be
appointed
to
that
body.
in
this
instance,
that
is
not
true.
i
do
not
have
the
same
equal
opportunity
as
the
other
optometrists
who
do
not
exercise
first
amendment
right
of
speech
or
association.
now
mr.
justice
marshal
asked
the
question
about
this
perpetual
minority
on
the
board
and
the
evidence
in
this
case,
it
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
it
is
before
the
court
in
the
form
of
board
minutes,
shows
that
since
the
composition
of
this
board
under
this
act,
there
have
been
some
60
instances
where
the
board
has
voted
four
to
two.
now
indeed
dr.
rogers
can
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
i
cannot
answer
that
question
in
fact.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
except
that
it
represents,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
not
only
is
your
bias
in
the
appointment
but
this
has
a
substantial
impact
in
the
service
upon
the
board.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
may
i
ask
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
it
is
in
the
record
yes
sir
but
you
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
by
post-submission
memorandum.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
thank
you,
sir.
