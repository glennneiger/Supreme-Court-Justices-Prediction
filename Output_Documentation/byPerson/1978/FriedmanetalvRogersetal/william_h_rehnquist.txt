justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
understood
asked
you
kind
of
an
either
or
question
and
you
said,
‘that's
correct'.
can
a
commercial
optometrist
join
the
toa
or
can
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
too
different
from
a
full
disclosure
requirement
of
the
securities
act,
resembling
that
in
that
case
of
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
keith,
supposing
that
dr.
rogers
instead
of
being
the
optometrist
business,
was
in
the
business
of
a
murder
for
a
hire,
could
he
take
out
an
ad
in
the
paper,
not
withstanding
a
prohibition
in
texas
law,
saying,
i
have
been
a
successful
murderer
for
hire
for
30
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
the
state
argues
here
too,
isn't
that,
that
the
underlying
activity,
this
particular
type
of
practice
is
illegal
and
therefore
he
may
not
advertise
it
as
such.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
all
means.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
i
am
sure
many
securities
registrants
have
taken
the
position
with
the
sec
that
they
have
disclosed
everything
that
needs
to
be
disclosed
and
that
nonetheless
the
sec
has
taken
the
position
that,
‘no,
you
have
not,
you
have
either
not
disclosed
a
fact
that
ought
to
be
disclosed
or
one
of
the
statements
you
are
making
is
misleading'.
is
not
that
what
texas
is
saying
here
that
this
particular
type
of
commercial
practice
tends
to
mislead
the
public?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
texas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
is
a
regulation
of
business
and
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
constitution
that
states
are
entitled
to
adopt
prophylactic
rules,
that
perhaps
may
sweep
more
broadly
than
is
necessary
if
they
are
intended
to
prevent
deception,
that
very
likely
some
people
who
would
have
no
intend
to
deceive
will
be
required
to
seize
certain
practices
or
perhaps
disclose
more
than
would
be
required
if
you
were
to
judge
each
case
on
an
individual
basis,
but
that
is
what
a
statute
is
all
about
it;
it
avoids
the
necessity
of
judging
each
case
on
an
individual
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
also
said,
you
may
not
practice
under
a
trade
name
and
if
the
state's
substantive
provision
in
that
regard
is
permissible,
certainly
it
can
prohibit
the
advertising
of
a
trade
name.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
when
the
state
regulates
business
conduct,
it
must
follow
some
sort
of
a
least
restrictive
alternative
tests
that
has
previously
been
reserved
for
the
first
amendment
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
itself
a
substitutive
prohibition,
not
a
prohibition
of
speaking
about
something
that
is
lawfully
permitted,
i
think
as
white
said,
what
texas
is
saying
is
that
if
you
are
practicing
optometry,
you
may
not
do
so
under
a
trade
name
because
of
the
potential
for
deceptiveness.
now
if
texas
is
permitted
to
do
that,
certainly
it's
permitted
to
prohibit
advertisement
under
trade
names.
you
have
to
argue
that
it
isn't
permitted
to
do
to
enact
the
substantive
regulation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
in
a
securities
case,
the
perspective
corporation
is
named
the
(inaudible)
states
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
decides
that,
that
has
a
potential
for
deceptiveness.
now
do
you
say
that
under
the
free
speech
decisions
on
the
commercial
area
of
this
court,
the
sec
cannot
prohibit
the
communication
of
that
information?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
the
state
cannot
legislate
a
prophylactic
rule
that
it
is
got
to
deal
with
a
case
by
case
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
subject
of
trade
names?
can
it
prohibit
a
particular
optometrist
whom
it
is
found
to
have
used
deceptive
practices
by
the
trade
names
from
using
a
trade
name?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
including
a
trade
name?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
feel
that
three
judge
district
court
has
right
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
legislature
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
three
judge
district
court
in
dealing
with
a
constitutional
challenge
to
a
statute
is
required
to
make
a
finding
of
fact
as
to
whether
a
trade
name
is
misleading?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
incoming
governor
of
texas,
whomever
that
may
be,
were
to
announce
as
part
of
his
platform
that
he
was
going
to
make
sure
that
four
out
of
the
six
members
of
the
texas
optometry
--
texas
board
or
members
of
the
toa
during
his
administration.
could
you
challenge
his
appointments,
if
they
conform
to
that
promise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
say
a
governor
appointing
judges
says,
i
think
we
need
more
representation
of
certain
groups,
do
you
think
someone
who
isn't
appointed
could
challenge
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
statutes
that
provide
that
and
so
far
as
i
know
they
have
never
been
challenged,
how
do
you
distinguish
them
from
this
statute
that
you
are
challenging?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
they
are
sort
of
published
in
the
agency
and
federal
trade
commission
or
a
democratic
vacancy
on
the
federal
trade
commission,
presumably
all
people
of
the
opposite
party
are
excluded
because
they
have
exercised
their
first
amendment
right
of
free
association
to
belong
to
the
party
which
vacancy
doesn't
belong
to.
