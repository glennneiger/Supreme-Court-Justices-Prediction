well,
that's
kind
of
secular,
isn't
it?
they
have
been
interested
in
enforcing
the
law,
because
the
law
benefits
them
and
probably
the
law
was
enacted
under
their
support.
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
to
your
benefit.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
perhaps
you
have
told
us
this
but
i
want
to
get
clear
in
my
mind,
what
is
the
total
membership
of
the
board?
justice
potter
stewart
and
their
member
serve
for
how
longer
term?
justice
potter
stewart
staggered
or?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
they
become
members?

appointment
of
the
governor.
totally
six
and
the
law
requires
at
least
four
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
matter
of
his
choosing
not
to
associate
with
toa,
he
is
ineligible,
isn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
is
not
quite
accurate
to
say
that
if
he
chooses
not
to
associate
with
toa,
he
is
ineligible
to
be
on
the
majority.
he
is
ineligible
to
be
in
toa
and
therefore
ineligible
to
be
a
member
of
the
majority
of
the
board,
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
opticians
are
just
manufacture
the
licensed
appliances,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
fill
a
prescription?
justice
potter
stewart
in
texas,
can
a
patient
come
directly
to
an
optician?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
they
have
to
first
go
to
a
optometrist
or
an
oculist,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
an
optician
cannot
deal
directly
with
the
patients
as
far
as
diagnosing
them.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
--
your
state
does
permit
to
practice
under
a
partnership
name
so
long
as
the
partners
devote
at
least
50%
of
their
professional
time
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
smith
and
jones
optometrists
can
practice
such
a
partnership
so
long
as
dr.
smith
and
dr.
jones
devote
at
least
half
their
time
to
the
partnership
work.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now,
can
they
practice
as
smith
and
jones
optometrists
and
also
have
as
partners,
brown,
black
and
green.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
they
are
not
mentioned
in
the
partnership
name?
justice
potter
stewart
but
each
of
the
named
partners
has
to
spend
at
least
50%
of
his
time
on
the
partnership
business
in
an
office.
justice
potter
stewart
then
again
gets
a
little
circular,
do
they?
it's
illegal
because
the
states
made
it
illegal.
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
that,
wichita
falls?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
quite
sort
of
like
mcdonald's
hamburger,
you
know
generally
what
to
expect
wherever
you
find
it,
isn't
that
the
idea,
even
though
there
is
a
variation
among
cooks
and
among
stores?
justice
potter
stewart
until
it
became
the
equivalent
of
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
the
equivalent.
