justice
john
paul
stevens
i
need
a
classification
on
this
point,
supposing
is
there
provision
in
the
statute
for
what
happens
if
a
member
of
toa
is
appointed
and
confirmed
and
starts
to
serve
and
then
resigns
from
the
association?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
resigns
from
toa,
not
from
that,
from
the
board.
is
that
an
automatic
vacancy
or
is
the
test
his
status
at
the
time
of
appointment
or
must
he
continue
a
member
throughout
his
term?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
niemann,
isn't
there
perhaps
some
inconsistency
between
that
argument
and
your
rejection
of
the
first
argument
your
opponent
makes.
your
justification,
the
reasoning
for
having
majorities
is
that
there
is
a
substance
of
bias
in
favor
of
enforcement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
the
judiciary
deciding
their
prejudice
or
the
judiciary
saying
that
we
accept
the
presumption
that
the
legislature
adopted
to
justify
its
statute
and
given
that
presumption,
must
the
legislature
not
out
of
--
i
mean
must
not
the
judiciary
out
of
difference
to
the
legislature
say
yes,
we
will
accept
the
proposition,
these
people
are
biased.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
other
question
if
i
may.
the
reason
for
a
favor
in
for
having
four
commercial
or
non-commercial
optometrists
is
the
interest
in
forcing
of
the
prohibitions
against
commercial
optometry.
what
other
than
the
trade
prohibition
against
practicing
the
trade
name,
what
are
some
of
those
provisions
that
remain
on
the
books
in
our
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
those
statutory
provisions
or
they
are
ethical
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
couldn't
that
still
happen
if
you
had
a
--
i
just
want
to
be
–
if
you
had
a
smith
and
jones
partnership,
with
45
other
partners
who
are
not
named
and
that
partnership
operated
offices
all
over
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
justice
powell
prompted
a
question
for
me.
does
your
argument
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
would
it
applied
to
another
statute
prohibiting
the
use
of
trade
names
and
other
service
industries,
forget
the
product,
but
say
in
the
cleaning
business,
you
couldn't
use
the
name
‘quality
cleaner'
or
just
something
like
that,
would
the
state
of
texas
have
the
constitutional
power
to
say,
‘we
think
cleaners
ought
to
identify
the
owner
and
location',
so
would
be
the
same
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
abuses
essential
to
your
argument,
i
guess
what
i
am
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
are
essential
and
if
the
other
side
would
have
persuaded,
so
those
abuses
could
be
prohibited
by
specific
prohibitions
but
also
prohibiting
the
trade
name,
does
you
case
then
collapse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
mr.
keith,
is
it
not
true
that
he
may
not,
not
only
does
not,
but
may
not
disclose
his
ownership
of
64
of
the
65
offices
he
owns.
isn't
there
a
statutory
prohibition
against
the
use
of
his
name
in
the
offices
in
which
he
does
not
practice,
even
though
he
owns
and
dominates
those
offices.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
therefore
is
it
not
true
that
even
though
he
is
the
managing
director
in
a
sense
of
all
of
those
offices,
nothing
in
those
offices
would
so
reveal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
do
you
challenge
the
statutory
provision
that
requires
that
non-disclosure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
is
a
higher
value
and
dr.
rogers
being
able
to
tell
the
public
that
toa,
the
trade
name
whatever
it
is
operates
the
office
else
where,
than
his
ability
to
tell
them
that
he
operates,
he
does
not
assert
to
write
it
to
disclose
his
own
connection
with
these
other
offices.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
couldn't
he
get
the
same
secondary
meaning
attached
to
his
own
name
if
it
was
made
clear
that
he
is
the
dominant
figure
in
all
these
offices.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
is
a
property
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keith,
you
talk
of
constraining
information.
the
specific
information
that's
constrained
is
as
i
understand
your
argument,
that
all
these
offices
follow
the
same
high
standards
or
open
the
same
hours,
charge
the
same
fees,
provide
the
same
prompt
services
and
all
the
like,
is
that
basically
what
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
64
of
the
offices
do
and
sit
and
the
65th
has
a
different
opening
and
closing
hours
and
has
a
very
crabby
receptionist,
and
has
different
things,
wouldn't
that
65th
office
get
the
benefit
of
the
information
as
the
other
64
which
would
not
be
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
certainly
we
cannot
assume
that
in
fact
all
65
offices
are
precisely
identical
in
all
respects,
can
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
does
not
really
guarantee
any
specific
item
of
information
will
be
true
in
the
65th
office,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
but
you
have
not
identified
for
me
any
specific
item
of
information
that
is
constrained
by
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
may
or
may
not
be
true
in
particular
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keith,
if
covington
&
burling
decided
they
wanted
to
practice
under
the
name
“big
judgments”,
would
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
will
say
‘quality
practice'
then.
say
what
you
said,
would
they
have
a
constitutional
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
name
“prompt
service”
something
like,
so
it
is
something
that
they
could
demonstrate
was
not
deceitful
at
all
with
respect
to
their
own
operation,
could
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
use
a
name,
you
know
some
non-personal
name
just
the
trade
like
toa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
they
have
a
constitutional
right.
