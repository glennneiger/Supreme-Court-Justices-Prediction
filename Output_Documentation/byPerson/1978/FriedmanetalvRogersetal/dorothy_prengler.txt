ms.
dorothy
prengler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
state
of
texas
and
the
members
of
texas
optometry
board.
i
will
address
the
issue
of
a
constitutionality
of
section
513(d)
of
the
texas
optometry
act,
which
provides
that
no
optometrists
may
practice
under
or
use
in
a
connection
with
his
practice
of
optometry
any
trade
name,
corporate
name,
assumed
name
or
any
name
other
than
the
name
under
which
he
has
license
to
practice
optometry
in
texas.
the
court
below
held
that
this
section
is
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
and
relied
extensively
on
the
holding
in
bates
versus
the
state
bar
of
arizona,
and
virginia
pharmacy
board
versus
virginia
consumer
counsel,
instead
of
properly
analyzing
the
state's
interest
and
the
first
amendment
interest
involved
in
this
section,
the
court
deferred
to
the
advertising
cases
as
being
determinative
of
the
outcome
in
this
case
and
thus
struck
down
the
statute.
if
the
balancing
test
in
bates
and
virginia
pharmacy
is
properly
applied
to
this
section,
it
becomes
evident
that
the
statute
validly
promotes
important
to
state
interest
and
inflicts
a
minimal
restriction
on
first
amendment
rights.
before
a
discussion
of
the
balancing
test
and
the
state
interest
advanced
by
section
513(d),
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
certain
elements
that
are
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
this
is
not
an
advertising
case.
optometrists
in
texas
are
free
to
advertise,
praise
the
availability
of
goods
and
services
or
even
the
quality
of
goods
and
services
as
long
as
it
is
not
deceptive
or
misleading.
therefore
the
consumer
is
not
denied
the
right
to
receive
the
information
as
was
true
in
bates
and
virginia
pharmacy.
they
can
also
advertise
in
any
media
that
they
wish
to
advertise
in.
the
prohibition
against
advertising
price
was
struck
down
by
the
court
below
and
we
have
not
appealed
that
issue.
we
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
opticians
who
merely
dispense
eyewear
and
are
not
licensed
in
texas,
might
freely
operate
and
advertise
under
assumed
names,
trade
names
or
corporate
name.
the
texas
optometry
act
fully
allows
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
right
and
they
are
not
licensed
in
texas.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes,
patient
can
come
directly
to
an
optician
to
get
glasses
if
they
have
a
prescription
from
a
doctor.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct.
they
can
only
fill
a
prescription.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
right.
dr.
rogers
is
free
under
the
texas
optometry
act
to
use
the
name
texas
state
optical
in
his
opticianaries
and
in
fact
he
does
so
use
it
in
over
100
opticianaries
in
texas.
thus
his
ability
to
use
a
trade
name
in
the
merchandising
business
of
selling
frames
and
filling
eye
glasses
prescription
is
in
no
way
impaired
by
the
statute.
i
would
briefly
like
to
give
the
court
some
additional
facts
to
show
why
the
legislature
was
reasonable
in
enacting
section
513(d),
the
assumed
name
statute.
this
particular
section
was
passed
two
years
after
the
opinion
of
the
texas
supreme
court
in
texas
state
board
of
examiners
in
optometry
versus
carp.
the
court
specifically
discussed
that
some
of
the
abuses
and
the
evils
that
existed
in
the
practice
of
optometry
under
an
assumed
name
in
texas.
thus
the
legislature
when
they
passed
the
statute
was
specifically
aware
of
past
abuses
that
had
occurred
in
the
texas
in
the
practice
of
optometry
under
a
trade
name,
and
had
been
specifically
found
by
the
texas
supreme
court
to
be
misleading
to
the
public.
it
was
in
response
to
those
abuses
that
the
statute
was
passed
and
we
contend
that
the
legislature
had
compelling
reasons
to
enact
the
statute
in
light
of
this
particular
case
and
the
abuses
that
were
actually
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
right,
you
can
practice
in
association
with
other
optometrists,
but
you
have
to
practice
under
the
names
of
all
the
optometrists.
the
statute
does
allow
optometrists
to
practice
under
a
partnership
name.
as
long
as
the
names
of
the
partners,
those
partners
actually
practice
there
at
the
office
and
statute
requires
that,
they
have
to
at
least
practice
at
the
office
50%
of
the
time.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
it
requires
that
the
individual
optometrist
hold
himself
out
in
his
own
name.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
no.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
what
we
would
contain,
that's
correct,
that
it
â€“
and
in
fact
it
requires
that
the
optometrists
give
more
information
to
the
public.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct.
if
the
individual,
he
must
practice
under
that
name
and
he
cannot
use
a
trade
name
in
connection
with
this
practice,
that's
correct.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes
that's
correct.
yes,
there
had
been
an
abuse
in
texas
where
partnership
--
where
names
of
owners
of
a
practice
were
used
on
the
door
and
this
was
found
to
be
deceptive
since
they
were
not
actually
there.
that's
why
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct
your
owner.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes
they
can,
that
is
specifically
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct
and
the
statute
also
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
right.
at
one
time,
optometrists
in
texas
were
permitted
to
practice
under
a
trade
name.
then
in
1959,
the
optometry
board
as
part
of
their
rule
making
powers
at
that
time
adopted
the
professional
responsibility
rule
which
prohibited
the
practice
under
a
trade
name.
the
rule
was
then
challenged
by
several
optometrists
including
dr.
rogers
and
it
was
in
this
context
that
the
case
came
before
the
texas
courts.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
the
court
did
not
speak
to
that
particular
issue.
however
the
abuses
were
not
present
in
a
situation
where
--
they
did
not
find
the
abuses
to
exist,
they
found
the
abuses
to
be
directly
associated
to
the
use
of
a
name
other
than
the
partnership
name.
and
there
were
no
abuses
that
were
documented
that
existed
in
the
use
of
a
partnership
name.
we
would
contend
that
at
least
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
partnership
name,
there
is
personal
accountability
there
in
the
name
of
the
partner
and
there
is
a
partner
whose
name
is
part
of
the
practice
and
it
weighs
more
accountability.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes.
specifically
some
of
the
abuses
that
were
found
by
the
texas
supreme
court
were
that
the
assumed
name
practice
disrupted
the
doctor-patient
relationship
by
concealing
the
identity
of
the
individual
optometrist
and
bearing
the
responsibility
of
the
licensed
optometrist
in
the
trade
name.
the
court
cited
situations
where
optometrists
would
add,
drop,
or
change
their
trade
name
at
a
particular
location
even
though
the
licensed
optometrist
will
remain
the
same.
the
court
further
cited
instances
of
optometrists
being
shifted
from
one
location
to
another
within
the
trade
name
practice
and
not
maintaining
a
stable
practice
in
any
one
particular
location.
the
court
found
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
they
could
not
operate
offices
all
over
the
state
under
the
statute
because
that
particular
name
could
not
be
used
all
over
the
state
unless
they
could
somehow
spend
50%
of
their
time
there
or
the
time
that
the
particular
practice
was
open
for
business.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes
your
honor.
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
they
could
not
be
the
namedpartners
because
under
the
statute,
it
would
be
prohibited.
they
could
not
spend
the
requisite
amount
of
time.
you
would
have
to
have
different
optometrists
at
different
locations
with
different
names.
yes,
that
would
be
possible.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
true.
the
court
further
found
that
it
was
common
for
one
trade
name
owner
to
have
different
trade
name
practices
under
different
names
within
a
small
geographical
location.
this
gave
the
impression
to
the
public
that
each
of
the
offices
were
independently
owned
and
operated.
the
court
specifically
found
that
the
practices
of
optometry
under
a
trade
name
was
misleading
and
confusing
to
the
public
and
it
was
against
this
background
that
the
texas
legislature
enacted
the
prohibition
in
1969.
dr.
rogers
urges
that
the
assumed
name
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
a
violation
of
commercial
free
speech.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
assumed
name
statute
does
not
easily
fit
into
the
commercial
free
speech
category.
it
is
a
concept
that
is
admittedly
difficult
to
characterize
but
we
would
contend
that
it
should
be
properly
characterized
as
a
regulation
of
conduct
rather
than
speech.
the
statute
is
designed
to
regulate
the
mode
of
practice
and
it
is
designed
to
cure
the
abuses
that
have
existed
in
texas
in
relatively
recent
times.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
ensure
that
optometrists
do
not
obscure
their
license
identity
by
merging
their
identity
with
other
licensed
optometrists
under
one
trade
name.
the
assumed
name
statue
is
primarily
directed
towards
preserving
the
individual
optometrist
identity,
rather
than
regulating
his
speech.
if
the
assumed
name
statute
is
viewed
as
a
regulation
of
conduct
as
we
contend
that
it
should
be,
a
rational
basis
test
is
used
to
analyze
the
statute
and
if
the
facts
indicate
there
is
clearly
a
rational
basis
for
the
statute.
however
if
the
assumed
name
is
characterized
primarily
as
a
regulation
of
commercial
free
speech,
the
properties
for
announces
would
be
the
balancing
test
as
set
out
in
bates.
even
under
the
balancing
test,
the
assumed
name
statute
withstands
constitutional
muster.
in
applying
the
balancing
tests,
the
various
interests
a
state
has
in
enacting
the
statute
are
weighed
against
the
conflicting
first
amendment
interest
to
determine
whether
there
have
been
significant
abridgment
of
those
first
amendment
interest.
in
this
case,
any
encroachment
on
the
first
amendment
rights
are
minimal.
on
balance,
we
contend
that
the
interest
promoted
by
the
statute
in
protecting
the
health
and
well
being
of
the
citizens
of
texas
rises
to
an
acceptable
reason
for
prohibiting
the
practice
of
optometry
under
a
trade
name.
we
first
would
consider
the
sellers'
interest.
when
the
sellers'
interest
in
disseminating
information
is
considered
under
section
513(d),
we
contend
that
there
is
no
significant
impairment.
a
seller
is
allowed
to
get
his
message
across
to
the
public
through
his
own
name
and
through
any
form
of
advertising
that
he
wishes.
the
requirement
that
he
practiced
under
his
own
name
does
not
prevent
him
from
using
any
media
to
convey
this
message
to
the
public
as
long
as
the
message
is
not
fraudulent.
at
the
very
most,
the
section
imposes
a
minimal
restriction
on
the
wording
of
a
message.
it
in
effect
provides
more
meaningful
information
to
the
public
by
providing
the
name
of
the
individual
practitioner.
dr.
rogers'
real
complaint
is
about
the
effectiveness
of
a
merchandising
method
and
the
value
to
him
of
using
his
merchandising
method
to
attract
clients,
not
than
any
messages
of
press.
dr.
rogers
is
not
proposing
a
commercial
transaction
but
just
by
the
use
of
his
trade
name
as
was
the
case
in
bates
and
virginia
pharmacy,
but
rather
he
is
identifying
the
source
of
the
provider
of
services,
we
contend
that
the
identity
of
the
individual
is
more
meaningful
identification
of
the
source.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
i
believe
so
your
honor.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
your
honor,
i
don't
know
but
i
would
say
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes
your
honor.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
as
far
as
i
know,
no
sir.
i
am
sure
that
there
are
though
i
have
not
researched
that
particular
area.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
okay.
next
in
considering
the
consumers'
interest
in
receiving
valuable
information,
section
513(d)
does
not
restrict
the
information
that
is
received
by
the
consumer.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
only
if
the
state
could
find
the
type
of
abuses
that
are
present
in
this
particular
case.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes,
the
abuses
that
were
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
no,
we
would
contend
that
the
state
would
have
a
right
to
restrict
the
use
of
a
trade
name
assuming
that
there
has
to
be
some
reason.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes
sir,
that
would
be
certainly
be
a
distinction
in
the
use
of
a
trade
name
to
just
sell
products
but
certainly
not
have
the
same
potential
harms
and
consequences
as
it
would
in
the
health
related
field.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
we
think
that
he
does
get
significantly
more
information.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
no,
but
at
least
when
the
name
is
part
of
the
practice,
they
can
have
an
opportunity
to
check
out
the
particular
reputation
of
that
optometrist.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
through
their
friends,
through
acquaintances,
they
can;
it's
more
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
they
can
checkout
the
company
but
there
may
be
100
optometrists
at
their
company
and
that
wouldn't
give
them
the
information
as
to
the
reputation
of
the
individual
practitioner.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
there
are
--
in
this
particular
case,
there
are
a
great
many.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
true
but
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
but
the
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
i
think
that
the
state
of
texas
has
right
in
trying
to
do
encourage
the
situation
that
you
would
know
to
encourage
the
doctor-patient
relationship
and
encourage
the
possibilities.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
the
important
relationship
the
state
is
trying
to
promote
is
the
doctor-patient
relationship.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that
would
certainly
provide
more
information
than
just
the
practice
underneath
--
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct
because
the
legislature
felt
that
the
abuses
were
so
potentially
harmful
to
the
public
that
they
outlawed
the
trade
name
practice
completely.
the
consumer
in
this
particular
situation
is
not
deprived
of
valuable
information
as
were
the
consumers
in
virginia
pharmacy
and
bates.
the
consumer
is
not
denied
information
necessary
to
the
making
of
an
intelligent
decision.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
possible.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
they
have
to
be
in
the
office.
their
license
has
to
be
prominently
displayed.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
no.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
that's
correct.
ms.
dorothy
prengler
yes.
