costumers
are
not
a
party
to
either
lawsuit.
no
costumers
are
party
to
either
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
have
they
been
paid
by
sipc?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
costumers
have
been
paid
dollar
for
dollar,
have
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
they
would've
been
paid.
justice
potter
stewart
well
those
costumers
who
were
paid
off
dollar
for
dollar,
how
have
they
been
damaged,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
costumers
had
a
private
right
of
action
under
17
(a)?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
these
two
respondents
here
had
derivative
causes
of
action
only?
justice
potter
stewart
one
as
a
bailee,
the
other
as
a
subrogate.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that's
quite
a
different
group
of
people
for
quite
a
different
kind
of
damage
isn't
it?
in
other
words
that's
not
--
these
people
here
are
costumers
of
the
brokerage
firm.
justice
potter
stewart
and
their
problem
is
that
the
brokerage
firm
through
some
chicanery
went
busted.
the
other
remedy
to
which
you
refer
has
to
do
with
purchasers
and
sellers
of
securities
whose
damage
results
from
misinformation
or
wrong
doing
on
the
part
of
the
issuers
of
those
securities
which
they
purchase
or
sell,
which
is
quite
a
different
cause
of
action,
quite
a
different
group
of
protected
people,
quite
a
different
kind
of
damage
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
because
of
anything
they
purchase
or
sold
on
the
stock
exchanges
or
elsewhere
but
just
because
their
broker
went
busted.
justice
potter
stewart
well
but
those
cases
did
they
not,
and
maybe
they
didn't,
involve
explicitly
conferred
statutory
remedies
and
the
claim
in
each
of
those
cases
was
that
in
addition
to
those
explicitly
conferred
statutory
remedies
there
were
other
implied
private
causes
of
action
as
sanctions
against
the
same
category
of
wrong
doing.
here
we
have
quite
two
different
categories
of
wrong
doing,
don't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
one
would
be
wrong
doing
on
the
part
of
the
issuers
of
securities
that
are
bought
and
sold
--
purchased
and
sold
by
investors
in
the
securities
market,
and
the
other
--
and
quite
a
different
kind
of
wrong
doing
in
this
case
which
is
wrong
doing,
alleged
wrong
doing
on
a
part
of
a
brokerage
firm
vis-Ã -vis
its
own
costumers.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
those
committee
reports
were
a
little
mistaken,
at
least
taking
them
on
their
broad
statements
because
costumers
did
in
fact
have
remedies.
they
have
remedies
under
the
federal
bankruptcy
act
and
they
undoubtedly
had
remedies
at
state
law,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
the
'33
and
'34
act.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
except
you're
here
as
subrogee
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
there
is
that
ultimate
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
about
whether
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)--
and
your
co-counsel
represents
an
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
asserted
bailee.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he
has
standing
in
that
capacity.
justice
potter
stewart
so
to
that
extent
you
are
different
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
because
basically,
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
the
judgment
is
that
neither
you,
your
client
nor
his
client
has
a
right
of
action
on
his
own.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
only
a
costumer's
right
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
court
held
that's
a
costumer's
right
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
and
further
held
that
you
and
he
for
different
reasons
have
standing
to
assert
that
right
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
1934
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
in
1970?
justice
potter
stewart
the
section
18
remedy
was
part
of
the
original
'34
act,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
anymore
they
did
under
section
10?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
going
back
to
the
safety
appliance
act.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
might
not
the
trustee,
as
trustee
have
a
private
cause
of
action
under
state
law
against
the
accounting
firm?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
have
a
--
you
do
have,
do
you
not,
a
cause
of
action
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
as
trustee
not
as
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
it's
on
behalf
on
the
corporation.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
is
a
corporation
or
partnership
whatever
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
whom
except
derivatively,
if
they
get
--
if
you
recover,
the
corporation
would
have
more
money
to
pay
them
their
claims.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
wouldn't
the
effect
of
those
provisions
be
that
if
you
win
this
case
you
no
longer
have
a
state
cause
of
action,
because
this
would
be
your
exclusive
remedy?
justice
potter
stewart
17
and
18.
