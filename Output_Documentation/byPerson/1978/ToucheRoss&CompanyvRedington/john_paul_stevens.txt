mr.
roth,
i
didn't
understand
what
position
did
they
take
below,
the
sec?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
your
--
even
if
there
is
an
applied
remedy
you
still
would
needed
sepa,
even
if
there's
an
implied
remedy
for
fraud
you
still
would've
needed
sepa
to
take
care
of
the
non-fraud
bankruptcy
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is,
isn't
it?
i
mean
that's
exactly
what
they're
talking
about
in
what
you
read,
non-fraud
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
explain
this
--
could
you
explain
this
to
me
--
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
violation
of
17
(a)
by
a
broker
that
would
give
rise
to
litigation
by
a
purchaser
or
seller
where
he
could
recover?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
treated
the
bank
as
what,
a
purchaser
of
securities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
but
there's
no
--
there
wouldn't
be
a
claim
by
a
common
ordinary
person
just
buying
and
selling
stock
over
the
exchange,
wouldn't
it?
that's
a
rather
unusual
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right,
that's
why
18
(a)
primarily
deals
with
misstatements
that
relate
to
the
issue
or
the
security,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
a
case,
if
i
am
a
costumer
of
weis
and
i
get
a
false
report
about
weis'
financial
situation,
i
go
out
and
buy
general
motor
stock,
the
two
just
don't
fit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
forlenza,
on
the
question
whether
17
(a)
is
directly
intended
to
benefit
costumers,
your
opponent
argues
well
the
real
purpose
of
it
is
to
help
the
sec
with
its
enforcement
function.
and
that
the
other
courts
said,
“we
filed
with
the
sec
and
they
could
look
them
over
and
maybe
rebook
a
license”
or
something
like
that.
is
it
your
position
in
your
private
cause
of
action
that
the
costumers
relied
directly
on
the
filed
reports
or
they
were
in
effect
didn't
get
the
benefit
of
enforcement
action
that
would've
taken
place
if
correct
reports
have
been
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
reliance
is
an
element
of
an
18
(a)
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
failure
of
the
accountants
to
catch
it
and
the
failure
of
the
sec
to
catch
it
too,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
and
the
failure
of
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
forlenza,
may
i
ask
one
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
other
question?
if
you're
wrong
and
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action
against
the
accounting
firm,
and
that
you
take
consideration
that
the
accounting
firm
is
the
key
to
the
checking
and
catching
these
things,
what
remedy
is
there
against
the
accounting
firm
other
than
state
causes
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
what
would
their
crime
be?
is
there
a
criminal
remedy
against
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
against
the
accounting.
