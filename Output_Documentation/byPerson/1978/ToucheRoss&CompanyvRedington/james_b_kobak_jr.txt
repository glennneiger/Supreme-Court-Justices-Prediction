mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
costumers
with
unsatisfied
claims
in
the
weis
liquidation.
there
are
a
hundred
such
costumers
and
their
claims
total
over
$1
million.
it
is
essential
that
these
costumers
have
a
remedy
when
the
scheme
provided
by
congress
for
regulating
broker
dealers,
financial
condition
for
the
benefit
of
costumers
does
not
work
because
of
the
wrong
doing
of
a
third
party.
here,
the
wrong
doing
is
that
of
the
accountants.
we
allege
in
our
complaint
that
the
accountants
were
not
only
negligent
but
grossly
negligent
and
reckless
in
failing
to
follow
rule
17
(a)
and
in
failing
to
detect
fraud
which
infected
the
yearend
financial
statements
filed
by
weis
with
the
regulatory
authorities.
now,
it's
true
as
mr.
roth
points
out
in
his
brief
that
many,
many
other
documents,
financial
documents
are
filed
with
the
regulatory
authorities
by
brokers
in
addition
to
these
yearend
audited
statements.
but
there
are
over
5,000
brokerage
firms
in
united
states.
the
sec
which
did
appear
below
stated
in
its
brief
that
it
did
not
have
the
time
or
the
manpower
to
conduct
its
own
audits
of
more
than
5%
those
5,000
brokerage
firms.
these
other
financial
information
that
is
furnished
to
the
regulatory
authorities
is
of
no
value
except
in
so
far
as
it
is
keyed
to
the
audited
statements
that
are
filed
annually
by
the
brokerage
house.
as
long
as
the
monthly
and
other
data
filed
by
the
broker
is
consistent
with
the
yearend
statements,
the
sec
at
where
the
stock
exchanges
would
ordinarily
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
anything
was
wrong.
therefore,
if
the
audited
financial
statements
which
are
considered
the
barometer
of
the
brokers'
financial
condition,
if
they
are
inaccurate
the
entire
monitoring
scheme
established
by
congress
for
the
benefit
of
investors
in
their
capacity
as
costumers
cannot
work,
and
there
is
the
risk
there
will
be
loss
to
individual
costumers
as
well
as
to
sipc
which
is
precisely
what
occurred
in
the
weis
situation.
now,
mr.
roth
accuses
us
of
trying
to
make
accountants
scapegoats
for
every
brokerage
house
liquidation
and
he
suggests
that
if
congress
have
wanted
there
to
be
a
private
right
of
action
against
accountants,
it
would've
created
one
in
the
act.
well,
no
one
contends
that
accountants
are
the
cause
of
every
brokerage
house
liquidation,
the
facts
here
are
very
unique.
they
involve,
as
our
complaint
alleges,
gross
negligence
in
failing
to
detect
fraud,
the
facts
of
the
weis
liquidation
are
very
unique.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
according
to
touche
ross
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
--
as
trustee,
we
have
a
derivative
cause
on
behalf
of
weis,
as
a
corporate
entity.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
that
is
not
a
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
hundred
costumers
who
have
lost
the
million
dollars.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
we
have
a
negligence
action
and
perhaps
a
breach
of
contract
action
under
state
law.
however,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
that
cause
of
action
would
not
provide
any
protection
for
costumers
who
have
protected
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
oh,
but
that
would
be
money
that
would
be
paid
to
general
creditors
and
not
necessarily
the
costumers.
the
other
important
limitation
on
our
state
court
remedy
is
that
according
to
the
accountants,
we
can
not
rely
even
on
a
state
court
negligence
action
on
the
rules
established
by
the
sec
under
section
17
of
the
exchange
act,
because
of
section
27
of
the
exchange
act,
which
says
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
over
suits
in
equity
and
actions
at
law
is
exclusive
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts.
in
other
words,
if
our
negligence
case
in
state
law
is
to
depend,
as
it
would
have
to
depend
in
large
part
on
violations
of
specific
duties
set
forth
in
subparagraph
g
through
i
of
rule
17a-5
as
it
existed
in
1973,
the
accountants
say
we
could
not
rely
on
that
as
a
breach
of
duty
under
state
law
and
we
would
be
left
without
a
remedy.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
they
said
in
the
papers
filed
both
in
our
state
court
action
and
with
the
district
court
when
they
made
their
motion
to
dismiss,
we
had
a
cause
of
action
based
on
negligence
per
se
in
the
accountant's
breach
in
failure
to
follow
the
provisions
of
rule
17a-5.
touche
ross
said
in
its
papers
in
both
courts
that
that
did
not
state
a
cause
of
action
under
rule
17
because
if
there
was
any
jurisdiction
to
enforce
those
provisions,
it
was
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
no
i
don't
necessarily
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
is
an
issue
that
may
exist
in
state
court
actions.
in
this
case,
there's
no
reason
why
that
should
even
be
an
issue.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
borak
case,
i
think
it's
clear
from
justice
harlan's
concurrence
in
the
bivens
when
he
discusses
the
borak
case
in
a
footnote
that
one
of
the
reasons
section
27
exist
is
to
ensure
that
there
be
remedies
for
the
beneficiaries
of
exchange
act
provisions
and
that
those
remedies
be
uniform
across
the
united
states.
now,
state
court
law
on
accountants'
liability
has
developed
in
ways
that
are
divergent.
it's
developed
in
ways
that
are
tied
to
developments
in
professional
malpractice
actions.
generally,
those
developments
have
nothing
in
particular
to
do
with
the
federal
policy
of
regulating
broker
dealers
for
the
benefit
of
their
costumers.
mr.
roth
says
that
he
is
relying
primarily
on
three
cases,
the
amtrak
case,
the
barber
case
and
the
blue
chip
stamps
case.
in
amtrak
and
barber,
there
was
no
equivalent
of
section
27
of
the
exchange
act.
in
addition,
if
a
cause
of
action
have
been
recognized
on
behalf
of
the
private
plaintiff,
in
either
of
those
cases,
it
would
not
only
have
been
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
goals
in
legislating
on
behalf
of
a
particular
class
of
people,
it
would've
been
antagonistic
to
those
goals.
for
instance,
in
amtrak
you
could've
had
a
person
in
one
part
of
the
country
saying,
“don't
cut
off
my
railroad”
and
filing
a
suit.
that
might
have
been
in
his
interest,
but
it
would
have
been
antagonistic
to
the
interests
of
other
railroad
passengers
or
would
be
railroad
passengers
in
other
portions
of
the
united
states.
similarly,
in
the
barber
case
where
this
court
recognized
that
a
private
citizen,
a
costumer
of
a
brokerage
house
even
though
the
beneficiary
of
the
sepa
act,
should
not
have
standing
to
invoke
the
remedies
of
sepa,
there
was
a
clear
antagonism
among
interest
of
the
class.
one
costumer
might
have
wanted
his
brokerage
house
liquidated
immediately,
another
would
prefer
that
the
sec
or
the
stock
exchange
undertake
the
efforts
that
this
court
pointed
out
those
authorities
commonly
undertake
to
see
if
that
brokerage
house
could
not
be
saved
and
spare
any
possible
loss
to
costumers.
similarly,
in
the
piper
case
where
the
necessity
language
was
underscored
three
times
on
page
25,
the
question
there
was
a
different
question.
the
question
was
not
whether
any
private
right
of
action
was
consistent
with
congressional
goals.
the
question
was
whether
it
was
necessary
that
the
particular
plaintiff
involved
there
be
given
a
right
of
action
in
order
to
effectuate
those
goals.
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
was
not
a
member
of
the
protected
class
and
again
there
was
a
possible
antagonism
between
his
interest
and
the
interest
of
the
class
as
a
whole.
that
was
pointed
out
by
chief
justice
burger
on
behalf
of
the
court
at
page
39
of
the
opinion.
the
principles
that
are
applicable
here
are
those
of
the
borak
case.
there
are
those
of
bivens
against
six
unknown
narcotics
agents,
but
there
are
also
the
principles
that
have
been
applied
in
a
well
established
line
of
cases
in
the
lower
courts
under
section
6
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
section
6
creates
no
private
right
of
action
expressly,
that
provision
like
section
17
was
designed
by
congress
for
the
protection
of
investors
in
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
in
our
case,
we
would
have
to
prove
duty
on
behalf
of
touche
ross
breach
of
that
duty
and
causation,
the
elements
of
any
lawsuits.
we
do
not
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
well,
in
our
view,
our
prima
facie
showing
of
causation
would
require
us
to
show
that
touche
ross
through
its
negligence
or
gross
negligence
or
recklessness
failed
to
detect
fraud
which
had
it
discovered
in
a
timely
fashion,
it
would
have
had
to
alert
regulatory
authorities
to
the
existence
of
it.
at
that
point,
the
regulatory
authorities
could've
taken
action
to
prevent
or
reduce
the
amount
of
damage
that
has
been
suffered
in
the
weis
liquidation.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
well,
the
regulatory
authorities
do
rely,
our
costumers
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
no,
that's
correct,
they
rely
on
them
to
the
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
no,
they
don't
have
to
rely,
the
regulatory
authorities
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
auditor
has
been
there
has
supposedly
performed
the
minimally
acceptable
steps
required
in
the
rule
17a-5
audit
and
has
discovered
no
irregularity.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
my
clients
are
the
costumers,
we're
the
bailee
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
no,
in
fact
at
the
time
in
question,
there
was
no
congressional
requirement
or
regulatory
requirement
of
the
sec.
the
costumers
even
received
these
statements.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
a
purchaser
of
license
securities
would.
the
case
that
mr.
roth
talks
about
is
that
of
a
subordinated
lender,
that
subordinated
lender
claimed
that
he
received
a
copy
of
the
false
financials.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
they're
in
better
shape
than
buyers
because
congress
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
in
those
rare
case
when
they
suffer
a
loss
because
of
a
brokerage
house
failure.
the
reason
that
they
are
in
a
better
position
is
that
congress
legislated
it
in
the
exchange
act
that
they
be
the
beneficiaries
of
a
very
extensive
scheme
of
monitoring
and
regulating
broker
dealers.
when
the
accountant
fails
to
act,
that
scheme
cannot
function.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
he's
going
to
have
to
prove
reliance,
that's
correct
because
he's
in
a
different
category.
he's
a
purchaser
and
seller.
he's
probably
going
to
have
to
prove
fraud.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
when
there
has
been
a
brokerage
house
failure,
the
costumer
through
the
trustee,
has
to
show
that
the
system
could
not
work
because
the
accountants
failed
to
alert
the
regulatory
authorities
to
the
existence
of
fraud
and
falsement
financial
statement.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
he
can't
sue
in
both
those
capacities
at
the
same
time.
as
a
costumer,
he's
buying
through
the
broker
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
well,
you
could
conceivably
have
someone
who
is
both
the
weis
costumer
and
a
weis
shareholder.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
yes,
he'd
be
dealing
in
two
different
capacities.
he'd
have
different
burdens
of
proof
under
both
statutes.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
congress
wanted
these
costumers
--
congress
wanted
innocent,
the
ignorant
man
in
the
street,
the
most
naïve
person
imaginable
to
deal
in
the
nation's
capital
markets.
it
was
a
matter
--
it's
a
matter
of
indifferent
--
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
your
honor,
but
i
suggest
those
ignorant
buyers
are
unable
to
sustain
their
causes
of
action
because
they're
unable
to
prove
reliance
and
fraud.
mr.
james
b.
kobak,
jr.
because
congress
wanted
the
costumer
to
be
able
to
rely
on
the
regulatory
authorities
to
do
that
for
them
and
not
have
to
make
his
own
sophisticated
analysis
of
a
broker's
financial
statements.
thank
you.
