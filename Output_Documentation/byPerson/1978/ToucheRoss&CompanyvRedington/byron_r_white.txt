justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
that
the
position
of
the
commission
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
whether
the
commission's
brief
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
part
of
the
record
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
haven't
filed
their
own
brief
here
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you're
right
there's
this
so
called
private
right
of
action,
what
are
the
elements
that
your
client
would
have
to
prove?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
causation
would
amount
to
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
no
event
does
either
the
regulatory
agency
or
your
clients
or
anybody
else
have
specifically
to
rely
on
the
accuracy
of
the
statements
that
were
filed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
don't
--
they
don't
rely,
they
just
--
you
wouldn't
have
to
prove
for
example
that
they
examined
these
statements
and
relied
on
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answers
is
nobody
has
to
rely
on
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
that
extent
they
were
there
and
for
all
anybody
knows,
they
did
go
through
some
steps,
they
filed
some
wrong
statements
that's
how
i
take
it.
but
your
clients
don't
need
to
rely
on
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
i
understand
you
know
--
but
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
anything
with
respect
to
these
statements.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
a
purchaser
of
securities
have
to
rely
on
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
costumers
are
in
a
better
shape
than
buyers.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
so
far
as
being
able
to
impose
any
liability
on
the
accountants?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
buyer
can
recover
from
the
accountant,
but
he's
going
to
have
to
prove
some
reliance
on
the
statements.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know
he's
different
but
so
your
answer
is
yes,
the
costumer
is
in
a
better
position
and
with
respect
to
reliance
than
the
buyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he's
both
a
costumer
and
a
buyer
and
sues
in
both
capacities,
he
has
to
prove
reliance
in
one
and
not
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
about
the
same
thing,
he
can
certainly
could
be
a
buyer,
couldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
tell
me
you're
saying
that
--
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
there's
implied
cause
of
action
that
the
act
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
you.
now,
why
would
congress
think
that
this
--
i'm
sure
you
know
and
can
tell
me
why
the
--
why
congress
would
make
it
easier
for
the
costumer
than
the
buyer
to
recover
from
the
accountant?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
ignorant
buyers
around,
aren't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
--
i'm
just
asking,
why
shouldn't
costumers
have
to
prove
them?
