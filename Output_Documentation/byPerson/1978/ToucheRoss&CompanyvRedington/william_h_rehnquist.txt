justice

rehnquist
mr.
roth,
was
there
any
cross-petition
on
the
part
of
redington
or
sipc
from
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
forlenza,
is
there
any
substantial
difference
between
the
position
of
your
client
sipc
and
the
position
of
redington,
the
trustee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
issues
before
this
court
on
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
two
trustees
for
this
petitioner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
say
the
question
is
why
should
costumers
be
denied
this
right
of
action?
certainly,
that
isn't
the
way
you
would
ordinarily
phrase
the
question
when
you're
in
a
federal
court,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
the
exchange
doesn't
have
the
personnel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
sec?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
wasn't
taking
it
as
a
criticism,
but
i
was
thinking
if
there
are
any
number
of
criminal
statutes
in
the
country
and
many
under
staffed
u.s.
attorney's
offices,
and
i
don't
suppose
someone
would
come
here
making
a
claim
that
the
fact
that
there
aren't
sufficient
resources
allocated
to
the
u.s.
attorneys
gives
an
implied
private
right
of
action
because
the
u.s.
attorneys
are
understaffed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
rely
on
borak
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
take
that
you
don't
finally
accept
your
opponent's
word
in
the
lawsuit
as
to
whether
a
cause
of
action
exists,
do
you?
