mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
go
directly
to
the
heart
of
petitioner's
case
and
pick
up
on
the
points
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
no
situation
where
a
costumer
has
a
claim
under
section
18
(a)
for
anything
that
happened
regarding
violations
of
section
17.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
sections
17
and
sections
18
may
well
travel
separate
roads
at
intersected
times
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they
go
beyond
that
to
attain
different
goals
to
protect
different
categories
of
investors.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
on
the
merits?
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
i
believe
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
no
sir.
the
question
i
think
that
has
to
be
asked
is
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
i
meant
on
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
--
that's
right
on
the
merits
of
no
understanding.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
correct.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
correct.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
yes
but
we
have
no
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
that's
right
on
the
merits
we
have
no
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
well
actually
i
don't
think
they
raised
it
in
a
footnote
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
that's
right.
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
such
a
holding.
i
think
it
in
a
footnote
suggested
it
wasn't
particularly
receptive
to
it.
i
think
that's
more
accurate,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
are
here
on
those
capacities
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
that's
correct,
absolutely.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
that's
correct.
that
costumers
do
have
standing
under
section
17
for
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
i'm
not
sure
it's
part
of
the
record,
i
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
no,
and
i
must
say
that
i
take
issue
with
mr.
roth's
contention
that
their
absence
is
significant.
i
think
their
record
--
their
position
in
the
case
is,
as
in
the
second
circuit,
they
have
not
taken
a
different
position
in
this
court.
we
don't
know
the
reasons
for
their
nonparticipation
at
this
level.
now,
if
i
may
pick
up
again
on
the
point
about
18,
i
think
the
question
that
has
to
be
asked
to
is,
why
should
costumers
be
denied
a
right
of
action
against
accountant
who
violates
section
17
and
rule
17a-5,
notwithstanding
the
egregiousness
of
the
conduct
of
the
broker
or
accountant
or
extent
of
the
damage?
now,
mr.
roth
says,
its
two
things.
number
one,
congressional
silence
back
in
1974
as
to
a
private
right
of
action
is
some
kind
of
evidence.
and
i
think
this
court
has
well
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
1934,
i
think
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
congressional
silence,
particularly
when
there
is
no
pending
or
proposed
legislation,
is
evidence
of
very
little.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
my
point
was
addressed
to
the
arguments
that
mr.
roth
was
making.
we
contend
that
they
have
such
a
right
under
section
17,
they
are
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
that
statute,
they
have
been
harmed
by
a
violation
of
the
statute
under
the
cort
v.
ash
or
any
other
test
be
it
amtrak
or
barber.
there's
no
legislative
intent
to
the
contrary
and
it
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
purpose.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
absolutely
not,
so
the
question
is,
should
this
court
imply
a
private
right
of
action.
the
petitioner
says
it
ought
not
to,
not
because
of
any
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
mr.
justice
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
absolutely,
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
i
think
in
cort
v.
ash,
the
court
recognized
that
there
are
times
when
congress
creates
the
duty,
does
not
address
the
remedy
other
than
placing
in
the
hands
of
the
commission
for
example.
and
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
when
the
cort
v.
ash
fact
is
admit
to
imply
remedy
as
it
did
in
section
14
(a)
in
borak,
and
most
interestingly
in
10
(b).
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
well,
on
the
question
of
necessity,
let
me
say
this,
i
think
that
as
to
the
necessary
supplement
to
commission
action
which
is
the
phraseology
used
by
this
court
in
several
occasions,
there
is
no
question
that
the
commission
nor
the
exchanges
has
ever
intended
to
have
the
resources
or
ability
to
conduct
the
kinds
of
audits
that
are
required
to
expose
brokers
fraud
in
hiding
in
that
capital
violation.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it's
common
knowledge,
these
kinds
of
audits
take
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
man
hours.
now
the
commission
hasn't
got
the
ability
nor
the
resources
to
conduct
those.
number
two,
mr.
roth
talks
about
the
fact
that
all
costumers
in
this
case
represented
by
the
trustee
who
have
claims
of
loses
in
excess
of
$1
million,
because
they
were
over
the
limit
of
the
sipc
fund.
it
is
necessary
to
inquire
a
private
right
of
action
to
compensate
those
costumers.
if
i
may
get
back
to
the
section
18
point,
my
adversary
says
that
the
reason
for
denying
the
private
right
of
action
to
costumers
not
withstanding
section
17,
the
duty
on
the
accountant
set
forth
there
and
in
the
rule
is
not
because
of
any
clear
legislative
intent,
but
the
maxim
of
expressio
unius
and
this
court's
decision
in
amtrak.
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
in
amtrak
and
barber,
there
was
a
statute
directly
on
point
giving
to
a
certain
party,
in
that
case
the
government
and
a
very
limited
class
of
private
parties,
a
remedy
for
the
very
wrong
question.
here,
18
deals
with
filed
information
which
has
an
adverse
effect
on
the
price
of
the
security,
that
is
to
say
fraudulent
statements.
section
17
doesn't
address
that
kind
of
situation
when
congress
made
the
contours
of
a
section
18
claim
and
made
all
the
sense
in
the
world
for
the
same
reasons
as
blue
chip,
to
require
a
purchase
or
seller
requirement
as
a
limitation.
no
such
limitation
makes
sense
in
a
costumer
claim.
indeed
it's
not
a
limitation
on
a
remedy,
it's
a
denial
of
a
remedy
to
costumers.
turning
to
the
intended
beneficiaries,
mr.
roth
takes
issue
with
the
fact
that
section
17
has
as
its
intended
beneficiaries
the
costumers
and
it
only
point
to
sections
8
(b)
and
15
(c)
3
of
the
'34
act,
which
are
the
basis
for
the
net
capital
rule
to
point
out
that
congress
was
indeed
interested
in
protecting
costumers
against
losses
by
reason
of
insolvency
of
brokerage
houses.
section
17
is
the
only
mechanism
for
finding
out
about
such
violations.
secondly,
for
35
years,
the
commission
has
interpreted
the
rule
as
protecting
costumers
in
justly
situations.
as
recently
as
january
of
this
year,
the
daniels
case
the
court
pointed
out
that
a
consistent
and
long
standing
interpretation
by
the
commission
is
entitled
to
great
weight.
in
that
case,
the
interpretation
is
neither
long
standing
nor
consistent
but
that
certainly
how
the
case
here
with
rule
17a-5.
now,
as
to
this
legislative
intent
in
1970
with
the
enactment
of
sepa,
if
the
court
will
look
closely
at
the
senate
report,
it
talked
about
operational
difficulties
in
the
1960's,
the
back
office
problem
that
gave
rise
to
the
demise
of
most
of
the
brokerage
houses
at
that
time.
they
were
not
talking
about
situations
where
accountants
had
failed
to
pick
up
a
fraud
which
exacerbated
the
situation
where
the
brokerage
house
resulted
in
this
demise,
number
one.
number
two,
the
void,
unlike
the
daniels
case,
was
a
lack
of
insurance,
that
is
to
say
investor
confidence
had
barely
been
shaken
and
implied
lawsuits
of
long
duration
are
hardly
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
give
investors
the
confidence
they
required
at
that
time,
sepa
was
set
up
for
that
purpose.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
mr.
roth
overstates
the
congressional
intent.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
sepa
--
excuse
me,
that
congress
even
addressed
the
question
of
implied
rights
against
accountants.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
1970
with
the
enactment
of
sepa.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
that's
correct.
in
1934,
there
was
a
section
18
remedy
of
purchase
or
seller
requirement,
there
was
8
(b)
in
1934
which
is
the
grandfather
of
net
capital
rule,
and
there
was
section
17
clearly
designed
to
protect
costumers.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
congress
simply
did
not
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
should
be
an
implied
private
right
of
action
under
17.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
10
(b)
as
this
court
specifically
pointed
out,
neither
congress
nor
the
commission
considered
the
question.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
the
same
is
true
with
14
(a)
under
borak.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
it's
the
latter
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
addition,
i'm
not
sure
that
in
this
kind
of
case
reliance
in
its
classic
sense
is
really
an
element.
well
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
that's
correct.
if
there's
reliance,
it's
reliance
of
the
system
if
you
will,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they've
been
directly
harmed
by
a
breakdown
in
the
system
caused
by
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
well,
but
again
the
point
is
upon
whom
is
there
duty
evolved.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
yes,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
mechanism
set
out
by
congress
initially
in
the
commission
thereafter
is
that
the
commission
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
pick
up
these
kinds
of
deceptive
practices.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
17
(a)
report
certification
is
the
key
to
the
system
of
picking
up
in
that
capital
violation
when
the
broker
is
trying
to
hide
the
fact.
there
are
spot
checks
by
the
exchange,
there
are
monthly
reports
by
the
brokers
to
the
exchange
when
the
commission
has
any
indication
whatsoever
that
there's
something
wrong,
it'll
send
out
a
team
of
examiners.
but
audits
of
a
nature
that
are
designed
to
illuminate
this
kind
of
fraud
simply
can't
be
done
by
the
exchange.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
the
personnel,
the
resources,
the
expertise,
if
you
will,
in
terms
of
these
kinds
of
detailed
audits.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
they
can't
be
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
i
think
the
same,
except
for
the
expertise
question,
i
mean
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
if
i
may
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
they
can
hardly
be
criticized
if
in
fact
the
machinery
set
up
by
congress
is
such
they
were
not
intended
to
take
on
the
function
that
the
independent
auditor
voluntarily
assumes.
he's
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
well,
but
that
reasoning
has
been
applied
under
the
'34
act
and
securities
laws
and
again
i
point
to
10
(b)
which
is
a
criminal
statute,
14
(a)
which
is
a
criminal
statute.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
they
--
when
they
don't
work
the
issue
before
this
court
is,
it
is
appropriate
necessary
to
imply
a
private
damage
remedy
to
the
persons
hurt
by
the
violations,
i
think
that's
the
issue.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
rely
on
borak,
cort
v.
ash
i
don't
think
this
court
has
said
otherwise.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
that's
correct.
in
rigsby,
and
although
there
has
been
criticism
by
petitioner
of
this
line
of
reasoning,
this
court
has
time
and
again
approved
that
reasoning
and
in
piper
for
example,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
court
never
reached
the
necessity
question
because
the
issue
before
the
court
was
who
were
the
intended
beneficiaries.
from
the
finding
that
the
regulated
parties
were
not
the
intended
beneficiaries,
i
think
everything
else
in
piper
flowed.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
well,
other
than
state
causes
as
mr.
roth
addressed
to,
there
are
just
criminal
with
full
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
yes,
i
believe
section
32
of
the
'34
act
makes
it
a
crime
to
violate
any
of
the
filing
statutes
or
regulations,
so
that
there
actually
there
would
be
a
criminal
--
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
against
the
accounting
firm,
but
as
i've
said
before
the
court
has
noted
that
criminal
sanctions
just
don't
work
often
and
this
is
the
reason
for
applying
a
private
cause
of
action.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
and
mr.
colbeck's
going
to
address
the
state
law
question
if
i
may
differ
to
him.
mr.
philip
r.
forlenza
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
only
certain
of
the
costumers
in
this
lawsuit
that
mr.
roth
has
made
reference
to
and
that
has
been
stayed,
and
this
court,
if
it
decides
in
favor
of
affirmance,
i
believe
that
case
would
probably
be
dismissed
because
between
the
two
of
us,
we
cover
all
the
basis.
i
think
the
suit
that
mr.
roth
referred
to
as
giving
a
rise
to
an
18
claim
under
section
17
is
worth
commenting
on
just
for
a
moment.
exchange
national
bank
purchased
subordinated
notes
from
weis
of
such
a
complicated
nature
that
the
district
court
found
there
was
more
of
the
nature
of
a
security
than
a
commercial
loan.
the
complications
which
are
highly
relevant
are
that
they
had
provisions
key
to
the
net
capital
rule,
were
dictated
by
the
sec
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
would
be
part
of
the
company's
net
capital.
so
of
course,
reliance
by
the
plaintiff
on
the
section
17
certification
was
relevant,
the
most
rarest
of
situations.
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
situation
to
be
a
preclusive
effect
on
section
17
violations.
thank
you
very
much.
