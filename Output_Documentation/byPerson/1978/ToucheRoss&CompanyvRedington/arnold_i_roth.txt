mr.
arnold
i.
roth
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
section
17
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
requires
broker-dealers
to
make
such
reports
as
the
sec
may
require.
and
section
18
(a)
provides
an
expressed
damage
remedy
to
purchasers
and
sellers
of
securities
who
relied
upon
misstatements
in
those
section
17
(a)
reports.
the
primary
issue
here
is
whether
in
light
of
the
limited
expressed
damage
remedy
in
section
18
(a),
whether
section
17
(a)
itself
also
provides
an
additional
implied
private
right
of
action
in
favor
of
costumers
of
brokerage
firms
who
are
not
purchasers
and
sellers
against
accountants
who
audit
the
section
17
(a)
reports
that
contain
the
misstatements.
there
are
also
two
subsidiary
issues
here
which
the
court
need
reach
only
if
it
does
find
that
section
17
(a)
creates
an
implied
private
right
of
action.
the
first
of
those
subsidiary
questions
is
whether
a
trustee
liquidating
the
business
of
a
defunct
brokerage
firm
pursuant
to
the
securities
investors
protection
act
of
1970
is
entitled
to
assert
the
section
17
(a)
rights
of
action
that
belong
to
costumers
of
the
brokerage
firm
whose
property
he
has
been
unable
to
return
in
the
course
of
the
liquidation.
the
second
subsidiary
issue
is
whether
costumers
of
the
brokerage
firm
who
have
been
compensated
with
money
obtained
from
the
securities
investor
protection
corporation
retain
any
section
17
(a)
rights,
and
if
so
is
sipc
subrogated
to
those
rights.
it
is
the
position
of
petitioner,
touche
ross
that
there
is
no
implied
private
right
of
action
under
section
17
(a)
in
favor
of
brokerage
firm,
costumers
or
anyone
else,
and
that
such
a
right
of
action
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
scheme,
the
evident
legislative
intent
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
it
is
also
our
position
that
even
if
you
assume
there
to
be
such
an
implied
right
of
action
that
neither
the
trustee
nor
sipc
may
assert
that
action.
now,
this
case
and
those
issues
arise
out
off
the
failure
in
may
of
1973
of
a
brokerage
firm
called
weis
securities,
and
its
subsequent
liquidation
under
the
securities
investment
protection
act
or
sepa
as
i
will
refer
to
it.
weis
at
that
time
was
a
member
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
had
approximately
35,000
costumers.
in
april
or
may
of
1973
the
sec
and
the
new
york
stock
exchange
learned
that
officers
of
weis
had
been
falsifying
the
books
and
financial
records
of
weis
so
as
to
conceal
a
deteriorating
financial
condition.
the
officer's
scheme
had
commenced
in
early
1972
and
had
continued
on
until
the
spring
of
1973,
and
upon
discovery
of
the
scheme
in
may
of
'73
upon
sipc's
act
application,
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
ordered
the
liquidation
of
weis
and
appointed
the
trustee.
the
liquidation
is
ongoing
and
sipc
is
said
to
have
advanced
$14
million
in
that
liquidation
for
the
purpose
of
paying
off
costumer
claims.
among
the
reports
falsified
by
the
weis
officers
were
the
weis
financial
reports
for
its
fiscal
yearend
in
may
26,
1972,
the
reports
for
a
yearending
about
a
year
before
the
actual
liquidation.
reports
which
were
filed
with
the
sec
pursuant
to
section
17
(a)
of
the
1934
act
and
the
implementing
regulation
rule
17a-5.
touche
ross,
the
petitioner
here
performed
the
annual
audit
with
respect
to
those
reports,
but
that
audit
failed
to
detect
the
misstatements
in
those
reports.
according
to
the
trustee
in
sipc
here
in
this
case,
touche
ross
failed
to
detect
the
misstatement
because
its
audit
was
conducted
in
a
negligent,
reckless,
careless,
unskilled
and
grossly
negligent
manner.
it
is
also
asserted
that
because
the
misstatements
went
undetected,
the
weis
officers
were
enable
to
continue
until
spring
of
'73
their
scheme
of
concealing
the
ever
increasing
losses
that
were
the
result
of
the
mismanagement
by
those
officers.
sipc
and
the
trustee
also
alleged
that
had
touche
ross
discovered
the
misstatements,
effective
remedial
action
could
have
been
taken,
the
force
liquidation
avoided
or
its
consequences
reduced.
on
the
basis
of
those
assertions,
sipc
and
the
trustee
commenced
two
separate
lawsuits
against
touche
ross.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
your
honor,
the
sec
appeared
in
the
second
circuit,
is
that
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
they
are
not
here
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
i
believe
there
is
significance
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
your
honor
the
district
court
had
dismissed
this
action
because
on
the
ground
that
the
section
17
(a)
claims
of
the
trustee
and
sipc
failed
to
state
a
claim
for
relief
because
section
17
(a)
does
not
imply
remedy
for
anybody.
it
also
dismissed
the
common
law
claims
for
accountant's
malpractice
and
so
forth
that
the
trustee
and
sipc
asserted
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
on
appeal
to
the
second
circuit,
sipc
and
the
trustee
sought
reversal
and
the
sec
came
in,
in
support
of
sipc's
position.
in
addition
to
this
action,
the
sipc
and
the
trust
--
the
other
action
that
was
commence
by
sipc
and
the
trustee
was
a
state
court
action
that
was
commenced
about
ten
months
before
this
one
in
the
new
york
state
courts.
except
for
the
few
conclusory
allegations
in
this
action
which
the
trustee
and
sipc
deem
necessary
in
order
to
assert
claims
under
section
17
(a)
of
the
'34
act,
the
complaints
are
exactly
identical
same
parties,
same
facts,
same
allegations,
same
damages
everything.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
no
costumers
are
party
to
either
lawsuit.
the
costumers
have
their
own
lawsuits
going.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
your
honor
i
think
most
of
the
costumers
have
been
paid
off
in
the
liquidation.
$14
million
of
the
amount
that
was
necessary
to
pay
them
back
was
put
in
by
sipc
subject
to
its
obligation
--
in
accordance
with
its
obligations
under
the
act
sepa.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
your
honor
i
don't
know
that
every
single
costumer
has
been
paid
dollar
per
dollar.
there
are
in
fact,
i
know
that
there
are
some
who
have
not
been.
i
believe
that
there
are
some
costumers
who
had
property
at
weis
which
is
over
the
limits
of
the
amounts
for
which
sipc
is
obligated.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
to
make
--
those
amounts
subsequently
had
been
raised
and
i
think
if
the
new
amounts
had
been
in
effect
in
1972
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
--
they
would
have
been
even
few
that
were
not
paid.
your
honor
to
finish
up
the
question,
the
costumers
have
suits
primarily
in
the
state
court.
of
course,
about
six
days
after
the
second
circuit
came
down
with
its
decision
saying
for
the
first
time
in
45
years
that
section
17
(a)
does
create
an
implied
private
right
of
action
in
favor
of
brokerage
firm
costumers.
they
started
an
action
in
the
southern
district.
that
action
is
presently
being
stayed
pending
this
appeal.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
your
honor
there's
another
lawsuit
which
touche
ross
is
not
a
party
to,
but
there
is
a
decision
in
the
second
circuit
saying
that
even
costumers
who
have
been
paid
off
in
full
by
the
trustee
still
have
causes
of
action
that
they
can
assert
for
the
kinds
of
damages
that
are
not
compensated
by
sipc.
that
is,
a
loss
is
on
the
--
say
the
inability
to
get
their
shares
back
when
they
wanted
them,
certain
tax
consequences
that
flowed
from
having
to
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
i
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
that
action
was
commenced
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
a
brokerage
firm
that
the
stock
exchange
and
sec
tried
to
have
weis
merged
with
--
in
the
last
days
of
its
existence.
in
the
second
circuit,
there
was
a
reversal
by
a
divided
court
of
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
this
action.
the
second
circuit
held
first
that
there
was
an
implied
right
of
action
under
section
17
(a)
for
the
costumers.
it
held
that
the
trustee
and
sipc
who
had
been
asserting
that
they
could
--
they
had
a
claim
under
section
17
(a)
in
their
own
right
could
--
did
not
have
such
a
right.
however,
the
second
circuit
did
say
that
the
trustee,
as
the
bailee
of
costumer
property
could
assert
the
section
17
(a)
rights
of
costumers
whose
property
the
trustee
had
been
unable
to
return
in
the
liquidation.
the
second
circuit
also
said
that
sipc
having
advanced
money
for
the
payment
of
certain
costumers
claims
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
both
--
they
both
cross-petition,
those
cross-petition
is
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
as
far
as
we
know,
yes.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
right.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
yes
sir.
the
--
judge
mulligan
in
the
second
circuit
filed
a
vigorous
dissent
in
which
he
dissented
from
all
of
the
findings
or
the
holdings
of
the
majority,
except
that
he
agreed
with
them
that
neither
sipc
nor
the
trustee
had
any
claims
in
their
own
right.
the
crucial
element
in
the
statutory
scheme
here
of
course
is
the
existence
of
section
18
(a)
which
already
provides
an
expressed
damage
remedy
to
a
certain
class
for
misstatements
in
section
17
(a)
reports.
section
18
provides
a
remedy
like
many
other
remedies
in
the
1934
act
only
to
purchasers
and
sellers
of
securities
who
relied
upon
the
misstatements.
the
presence
of
section
18
(a)
in
the
statutory
scheme
reflects
an
apparent
congressional
intention
that
a
damage
remedy
for
such
misstatements
would
only
be
available
only
to
purchasers
and
sellers
as
specified
in
section
18
(a)
and
would
seem
to
require
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
improper
to
imply
an
additional
and
broader
remedy
under
section
17
(a)
itself
in
favor
of
people
who
were
not
purchasers
or
sellers.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
well
your
honor
i
think
what
you
have
done
is
to
state
the
conclusion
in
a
different
way
than
i
have
just
stated.
section
18
(a)
does
not
give
to
the
costumers
a
right
of
action,
it
only
gives
it
to
the
purchasers
and
sellers.
alright,
now
they
have
lost
property
in
this
debacle
of
this
brokerage
firm.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
that's
right.
now
your
honor
the
question
that
we
have
to
decide
today
is
whether
they
ought
to
have
a
right
of
action.
now,
and
i
think
though
that
you
have
to
start
from
the
premise
that
if
congress
were
worried
in
1934
about
purchasers
and
sellers,
and
we
know
they
were
because
the
'34
act
is
filled
with
purchaser
and
seller
remedies.
and
if
they
were
also
concerned
at
that
time
as
my
opponent
say
with
brokerage
firm
costumers.
in
fact
i
want
to
get
to
the
legislative
history
that
shows
you
this
is
not
just
so.
but
the
second
circuit
says,
“brokerage
firm
costumers
are
the
favored
wards
of
section
17.”
now
if
that
so,
then
what
you
have
is
the
situation
where
congress
knowing
about
both
of
these
groups
gives
the
purchasers
and
sellers
an
expressed
remedy
and
doesn't
give
anything
to
the
brokerage
firm
costumers.
so
you
start
almost
logically
from
the
proposition
that
they
gave
one
something
they
didn't
give
the
other
one
something
and
they
must
have
intended
not
to
give
it.
now
i
think
your
honor
that
that
does
bring
us
to
the
cases
that
i
say
set
forth
the
appropriate
analysis
for
determining
whether
there
ought
to
be
or
ought
not
be
a
private
right
of
action
for
these
costumers.
those
cases
are
amtrak,
barbour
and
blue
chip
stamps
which
deals
specifically
with
the
question
of
implying
remedies
from
statutes
that
already
have
expressed
remedies
in
them.
and
of
course
amtrak
and
barbour
hold
that
the
congressional
enactment
of
a
limited
expressed
remedy
for
violation
of
a
particular
statutory
provision
is
probative
and
compelling
evidence
of
a
legislative
intent
to
preclude
a
broader
implied
remedy.
now
the
implied
remedy
that
you
would
get
from
17
(a)
is
broader
than
the
one
in
18
(a).
it
is
a
remedy
for
costumers,
not
for
purchasers
and
sellers
the
typical
group
of
people
whom
the
1934
act
was
to
protect.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
well
your
honor
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
your
honor,
yes
in
a
way
that
is
so,
but
i
think
your
honor
that
we
should
--
i
should
take
you
to
show
you
the
substitute
that
congress
thought
it
was
giving
costumers
in
place
of
the
private
remedy
that
was
given
to
purchasers
and
sellers.
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1934
act,
that's
where
i
would
like
to
start,
it
makes
no
mention
of
a
private
right
of
action
under
section
17
(a).
it
talks
only
about
the
administrative
enforcement
by
the
sec
and
about
the
sec
going
in
and
inspecting
brokers
and
dealers.
it
does
have
one
revealing
thing
to
it
though,
your
honor.
it
does
--
there
is
a
statement
in
the
legislative
history
that
makes
it
clear
that
the
sec
investigations
were
investigations
so
that
they
could
go
in
and
get
evidence
rapidly
in
any
case
where
fluctuations
in
the
price
of
a
security
indicate
that
manipulation
may
be
in
progress.
now
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
purchasers
and
sellers
are
concerned
about,
and
so
the
only
indicia
as
to
who
was
the
special
beneficiary
of
section
17
(a)
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
'34
is
that
it
was
purchasers
and
sellers
and
not
so
much
the
costumers.
however,
then
you
come
to
1970
when
congress
enacted
sepa.
now,
that
legislative
history
refers
to
certain
protections
for
costumers
or
it
did
not
refer
to
any
implied
right
of
action.
those
protections
that
it
was
referring
to
were
the
preventive
monitoring
system
that
was
in
its
infancy
and
then
was
made
much
broader
by
sepa
itself.
the
investigative,
injunctive
and
criminal
powers
of
the
sec
to
enforce
its
own
rights
under
section
17
(a)
to
enforce
compliance
by
the
brokerage
industry
with
17
(a),
and
it
was
talking
also
about
state
law
the
right
to
go
into
the
state
courts
and
use
traditional
state
law
remedies.
and
in
fact
the
house
report
refers
to
some
safeguards,
however,
on
both
the
state
and
federal
levels
as
well
as
an
industry
imposed
legislation.
but
the
most
significant
thing
is
that
the
senate
report
explicitly
stated
that
brokerage
firm
costumers
in
this
situation,
that
your
honor
has
referred
to,
have
no
remedy
available
to
them
under
the
1933
and
1934
acts.
the
senate
report
says,
“apart
from
the
voluntary
trust
funds,
there
is
no
protection
presently
available
under
existing
securities
laws
for
the
investor
whose
broker
goes
bankrupt.”
and
it
also
said,
“neither
statute
prevents
the
investor
from
loosing
his
entire
investment
if
his
broker
fails.”
a
recognition
that
there
were
some
protection
but
that
the
costumer
didn't
have
any
--
he
didn't
have
an
implied
right
of
action.
there
was
nowhere
he
could
go
sue
for
this
thing,
and
here
your
honor,
and
this
is
the
most
--
a
most
significant
thing
in
this
case.
what
congress
did
was
to
enact
sepa
and
to
create
and
to
create
sipc
with
the
function
not
only
of
being
part
of
the
early
warning
regulatory
preventive
monitoring
system,
but
with
the
function
of
paying
off
costumers
of
failed
brokerage
firms.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
that's
exactly
right
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
well
your
honor
i
think
that
if
you
read
that
--
read
those
statements
in
the
context
that
they
occurred,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
they
were
talking
about
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
--
they
didn't
have
any
'33
or
'34
act
remedies.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
and
senator
musky
says,
“there
still
exists
a
serious
gap
in
our
securities
laws”
and
he
was
talking
about
that
gap.
they
then
enact
sepa
and
create
sipc
for
that
purpose
and
your
honor
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
well,
your
honor
that
may
be.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
but
your
honor
they
--
i
think
that
there
is
still
is
--
even
you
take
care
of
the
non-fraud
situation,
you
are
taking
care
of
the
fraud
situation.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
in
other
words
your
honor
--
in
other
words,
purchasers
and
sellers
of
securities
don't
have
any
agency
they
can
go
to
and
get
money
from
if
they
lose
money
having
relied
on
misstatements.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
yes
sir,
in
fact
your
honor
we
have
one
in
the
southern
district
arising
out
of
this
very
same
case
--
this
very
same
weis
situation
in
which
we
are
the
defendant.
a
subordinate
--
a
bank
which
made
a
subordinated
loan
to
weis
was
given
the
weis
section
17
(a)
report
in
order
to
induce
him
to
make
that
loan,
and
he
made
the
loan
and
judge
wyatt,
the
same
judge
that
dismissed
this
action
held
--
upheld
a
section
18
(a)
claim
against
touche
ross
based
on
that.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
well,
no
your
honor
that's
hard
to
imagine
because
the
purchasers
and
sellers
--
you
know
a
costumer
is
a
purchaser
and
seller,
i
mean
we're
talking
about
almost
the
same
person
but
a
purchaser
and
seller
is
dealing
in
stocks
of
general
motors,
united
states.
he's
not
going
to
buy
or
sell
them
in
reliance
on
a
weis
report.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
no,
your
honor.
section
18
(a)
deals
with
a
--
with
misstatements
in
any
report
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
--
that
is
filed.
it
is
not
called
liability
for
purchasers
and
sellers
or
liability
--
remedy
for
--
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
that's
part
of
the
crux
of
this
problem
your
honor.
you
see
when
you
talk
about
a
prospectus
or
a
proxy
statement
that
is
something
that
goes
primarily
to
the
investor
and
is
primarily
designed
to
induce
him
to
act
or
not
act.
it
may
--
those
documents
do
go
to
the
sec,
but
the
sec
is
really
exercising
the
oversight
kind
of
function
and
it
is
important
that
your
actions
be
made
on
accurate
statements,
and
there's
a
congressional
policy
for
that.
on
the
other
hand
the
section
17
(a)
reports
particularly
in
1972
were
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
the
sec
and
going
to
the
regulatory
agencies
and
were
not
designed
for
the
basic
purpose
of
inducing
an
investor
to
make
a
decision
based
thereon.
now,
it
might
be
that
one
gets
out
into
commerce
somewhere
and
somebody
does
purchase
or
sell
a
security.
mr.
arnold
i.
roth
thank
you,
your
honor.
