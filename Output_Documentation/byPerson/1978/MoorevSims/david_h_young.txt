mr.
david
h.
young
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
today
we
are
concerned
with
numerous
sections
of
title
ii
of
the
texas
family
court
which
is
texas’s
effort
to
deal
with
the
law
of
parents
and
children.
it's
a
codification
obviously
of
many
parts,
it
in
part
reflects
in
statute
as
a
in
case
law
as
existed
prior
to
its
passage
in
1973
and
in
part
reflects
what
the
legislature
or
what
the
case
law
in
the
absence
of
statute
said
the
law
was
and
it
also
of
course
reflects
changes
that
the
legislature
made
in
the
statutes
and
case
law.
those
various
aspects
of
the
family
court
have
interplay
in
the
sections
which
are
before
you
here
today.
some
of
the
sections
which
we'll
be
discussing
are
matters
of
law
that
pertain
to
virtually
any
case
in
the
civil
courts
of
texas
and
others
are
sections
that
pertain
to
rather
more
limited
aspect
of
child
abuse
and
still
others
are
sections
which
have
only
to
do
with
certain
instances
or
certain
procedures
in
child
abuse.
because
of
the
numerous
chapters
and
sections
involved,
when
i
am
making
my
argument,
i
will
try
to
use
more
than
merely
numbers
of
chapters
when
i
am
describing
things,
for
instance
chapter
17,
i
will
always
try
to
refer
to
that
as
to
the
emergency
protection
provisions,
chapter
14,
i
will
try
to
remember
to
refer
as
a
conservatorship
or
custody
provisions,
likewise
chapter
15,
termination
of
parental
riots,
chapter
11,
which
is
involved
here
as
well
as
essentially
the
wholly
procedural
chapter
and
chapter
34
is
involved
as
not
a
judicial
per
se
chapter
at
all,
it's
really
an
investigative
agency
kind
of
chapter.
i
would
also
like
to
utilize
some
of
my
time
to
very
briefly
state
what
the
court
below
held
because
we
are
not
appealing
everything
that
the
court
below
held
and
from
reading
the
opposing
briefs,
it
is
at
least
my
judgment
that
many
of
those
briefs
are
on
issues
that
are
not
before
this
court.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
hope
so,
i
want
to
try,
i
think
it's
difficult
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
use
that
part
of
my
time
doing
it.
first
of
all,
of
course,
the
abstention
issue
we
clearly
are
appealing.
they
held
section
1110
of
procedural
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
failed
to
require
an
attorney
ad
litem
for
a
child
in
any
suit
affecting
a
child
under
the
emergency
statute,
the
conservatorship
statute
or
the
termination
statute.
we
are
only
appealing
that
as
to
the
necessity
for
an
ad
litem
at
the
emergency
hearing,
the
chapter
17
hearing,
we
are
not
appealing
it
as
to
its
impact
on
any
of
the
other
proceedings,
whether
for
conservatorship
on
a
permanent
or
temporary
basis
or
on
termination.
they
held
in
three
sections,
1111,
1705,
and
1706,
that
all
were
unconstitutional
is
failing
to
require
an
adversary
hearing
within
10
days
of
the
emergency
taking
of
the
child.
we
are
not
appealing
to
any
of
those.
they
held
section
1115
unconstitutional
on
its
face
as
to
the
standard
of
proof
saying
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
required
instead
of
preponderance,
we
are
appealing
that.
they
held
1702
unconstitutional
and
that
saying,
it
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
but
saying
that
immediately,
the
statute
says,
a
child
that
is
seized
will
immediately
will
be
taken
before
a
court
or
this
agency
seizing
the
child
will
immediately
obtain
a
judicial
sanction
if
you
will
to
have
possession
of
the
child.
they
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
the,
that
immediately
is
the
“very
day”
of
the
taking
we
are
appealing
that
limited
aspect
of
the
holding.
they
said
that
1703
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
that
it
fails
to
require
all
reasonable
efforts
to
serve
notice
to
one
of
these
suits.
we
are
not
appealing
that
and
we
would
frankly
characterize
that
as
one
of
the
more
gratuitous
holdings
of
the
court
below,
because
there
is
no
question
that
all
reasonable
efforts
should
be
made
and
were
made
in
this
instance
to
notify
the
parents
of
the
proceedings
and
in
fact
they
had
actual
notice.
they
held
section
3405
unconstitutional
on
its
face
as
failing
to
require
notice
and
a
hearing
for
the
parents
before
any
psychological
or
psychiatric
examination
of
the
children,
we
are
not
appealing
that,
that
wasn't
even
an
issue
in
this
case.
physical
examination
was
an
issue
in
this
case
and
the
court
made
no
adverse
holding
as
to
that.
they
also
held
the
child
abuse
neglect
reporting
enquiry
system
unconstitutional
as
applied
and
that
the
state
had
provided
for
a
central
registry
of
cases
of
suspected
abuse
and
those
cases
on
that
registry
were
not
limited
to
instances
in
which
a
judicial
determination
as
to
the
abuse
have
been
made.
finally
they
held
3408
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
that
being
the
confidentiality
provision
and
held
it
unconstitutional
and
so
far
as
it
did
not
provide
for
parents
to
be
notified
of
the
contents
of
the
records
that
the
state
had
on
them,
alright
or
requiring
the
states
upon
request
to
reveal
the
contents
of
the
record
except
for
informance,
we
are
not
appealing
that.
one
other
thing,
which
i
think
is
confusing,
also
is
that
the
woods
case
it's
my
understanding
it's
not
before
this
court.
it
was
consolidated
on
a
limited
issue
of
the
right
of
indigence
to
reporting
counsel
and
in
their
decision
in
this
case
and
the
judgment
the
court
below
said
that
consolidation
was
ill-advised.
we
did
not
in
our
brief
anyway
cite
to
you
what
became
of
that
case.
the
court
allowed
the
state
courts
to
proceed
and
in
december
of
1976
some
two
or
three
months,
after
the
decision
in
this
case
was
rendered
the
court
of
civil
appeals
reversed
the
judgment
and
restored
the
children
to
mrs.
woods
that
decision
is
reported
at
545
southwest
second
573,
that
reversal
was
based
on
an
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
kind
of
question.
that
i
hope
gets
me
into
what
i
would
like
to
talk
about
regarding
abstention,
because
in
that
case
the
woods
case
the
state
courts
were
allowed
to
function,
were
allowed
to
go
ahead
through
their
normal
processes
and
what
happened
is
that
the
parents
want
to
talk
about
abstention,
it's
also
necessary
to
spend
just
a
little
bit
of
time
on
a
chronology
of
the
events
that
occurred.
on
march
25th
1976
there
was
a
report
of
child
abuse
at
the
school
in
question
of
department
of
human
resources
worker
went
their
to
investigate
it
and
the
children
were
taken
to
a
child
welfare
clinic.
the
next
day,
the
very
next
day,
not
the
very
day,
but
the
very
next
day,
a
temporary
order
was
obtained.
day
after
that
paul
sims
who
is
the
subject
of
this
litigation
really,
excuse
me
was
hospitalized
where
he
would
remain
for
some
10
days.
on
the
5th
of
april
the
first
--
mr.
david
h.
young
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
david
h.
young
no,
your
honor
there
is,
according
to
the
deposition
of
judge
lowy,
which
i
will
discuss;
they
did
attempt
apparently
to
file
a
motion
to
modify.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
district
clerk
said
judge
lowy
was
not
present,
he
being
the
judge
which
had
entered
the
temporary
or
emergency
order
a
few
days
before
that
and
went
to
see
another
judge
to
see
that
he
would
hear
it.
he
evidently
said
he
did
not
want
to
hear
it,
and
that
led.
mr.
david
h.
young
that's
right,
that's
why
i
am
taking
some
time
to
go
through
it
in
the
first
place.
on
the
fifth
however
judge
lowy
was
around
and
a
hearing
was
had
in
his
court
room.
the
fifth
was
the
9th
day
of
the
duration
of
the
10-day
emergency
order.
at
that
time
plaintiffs
below
had
pending
a
habeas
corpus
action,
and
a
hearing
was
conducted
at
the
bench,
if
you
will,
all
of
this
is
explained
in
some
detail
in
judge
lowy's
deposition
and
then
motion
to
modify
was
never
mentioned
to
him
at
that
time.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes.
the
--
mr.
david
h.
young
yes.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes,
the
proceeding
--
there
were
two
state
court
proceedings
before
the
federal
court
hearing
on
this.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes,
the
first
one
was
the
one
that
i
mentioned
on
the
27th.
mr.
david
h.
young
brought
by
the
state,
i've
forgotten
the
name
of
the
individual,
who
signed
the
complaint
but
it
was
brought
by
the
state,
this
is
a
day
after
the
children
were
picked
up
at
school.
they
were
in
--
mr.
david
h.
young
yes.
mr.
david
h.
young
it
were
the
sims,
the
parents,
yes.
mr.
david
h.
young
that's
one,
the
next
one
was
as
a
result
of
this
hearing
on
the
5th
in
judge
lowy's
court
wherein
the
motion
for
habeas
was
pending,
also
that
was
on
the
9th
or
the
10th
day
i
forgot
which
of
this
10
day
order.
questions
as
to
venue
of
these
proceedings
--
mr.
david
h.
young
this,
the
second
proceeding
was
brought
during
a
continuance
of
this
hearing.
the
hearing
was
convened
at
10:30
in
the
morning
as
a
result
of
the
hearing
judge
lowy
had
substantial
questions
as
to
venue
of
these
proceedings
in
his
mind,
it
was
discussed
by
counsel
for
both
parties
before
the
court,
and
he
said
he
will
recess
this
hearing
until
5:00
o'clock
to
give
the
parties,
both
parties
an
opportunity
to
file
whatever
it
is
they're
going
to
file.
as
a
result
of
that
at
4:00
or
something,
the
state
filed
a
second
suit.
mr.
david
h.
young
in
harris
county,
the
same
county.
mr.
david
h.
young
and
as
a
result
of
that
second
suit—
mr.
david
h.
young
yes,
as
a
result
of
the
second
suit,
the
judge
took
an
official
cognizance
if
you
will
of
the
venue
issue,
transferred
that
second
suit
to
montgomery
county
and
transferred
with
it
the
habeas
action
on
which
no
action
had
been
taken.
mr.
david
h.
young
the
sims.
mr.
david
h.
young
you
could
even
say
four
if
you
wanted
because
at
some
point
the
sims
also
brought
--
attempted
to
bring
an
original
habeas
action
i
believe
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals
which
is
an
intermediate
court,
which
they
refused
to
take,
there
having
been
no
decisions
below.
mr.
david
h.
young
they
didn't
succeed.
but
as
i
understand
it
that's
not
the
question.
mr.
david
h.
young
montgomery
county.
mr.
david
h.
young
that's
right.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes.
mr.
david
h.
young
that
order
pursuant
to
chapter
17
was
good
for
only
10
days
and
this
subsequent
hearing
that
we
are
talking
about
not
an
ex-parte
hearing
it's
the
first
that
had
been
--
when
the
order
was
obtained.
mr.
david
h.
young
it
was
on
the
fifth
so
it
would
be
the
9th
day
i
think
yes,
which
is
why
i
think
he
said,
he
gave
him
till
5
o'clock
to
get
whatever
additional
pleadings,
motions
they
would
have.
that
order
expired
by
its
own
terms
on
the
10th
day.
after
that
10th
day,
there
was
nothing
possible
further
to
do
so
it's—
mr.
david
h.
young
well,
that's
a
very
close
question
and
i
think
that's
why
the
second
proceeding
was
filed
seeking
temporary
conservatorship
and
why
it's
that
proceeding
that
was
transferred
along
with
the
habeas
to
montgomery
county.
mr.
david
h.
young
we
relied
this
to
chapter
17,
was
filed
before
any
proceedings
of
substance
on
the
merits
in
federal
court.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
am
sorry
i
said
i
tried
not
to
do
it.
mr.
david
h.
young
the
emergency
proceeding
filed
the
day
after
the
child
was
picked
up.
mr.
david
h.
young
we
argue
that
it's
a
question
of
definition
of
what
the
--
there
was
no
order,
there
was
order
in
effect
by
the
county.
mr.
david
h.
young
without
question
as
was
the
habeas.
mr.
david
h.
young
at
least
probably
three.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes,
it's
immediately
to
the
north,
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
counties
in
between,
if
you
can't
tell
one
from
the
other
it's
all
urban.
mr.
david
h.
young
that
gets
to,
that's
what
it
was
subsequently
interpreted
to
be
by
the
federal
court.
it
was
not
clear
from
the
statute
that
it
would
expire
after
10
days.
mr.
david
h.
young
they
didn't
believe
it
would
expire
after
10
days,
but
we
are
not
appealing
that
aspect.
mr.
david
h.
young
oh,
yes
because
i
distinguish
between
a
pending
law
suit
and
an
order
that's
in
effect.
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
any
order
to
be
in
effect
to
have
a
pending
law
suit
in
state
court
if
my
understanding
is
correct.
mr.
david
h.
young
oh
they
did
and
that's
what
they
did
argue
on
april
5th
in
the
hearing
in
federal
court,
whereupon
we
said
accepting
that
we
didn't
use
these
words,
but
accepting
that
as
a
given
then
can
we
go
file
another
lawsuit
in
montgomery
county
and
get
all
those
cleared
up,
and
it
was
our
understanding
that
managing
judge
said,
yes,
whereupon
we
did
on
april,
on
may
the
14th,
whereupon
the
sims
is
absenting
themselves
from
anywhere
where
they
could
be
served
with
a
writ
of
attachment
that
went
with
that
case
but
somehow
mysteriously
they
must
have
learned
about
it
because
they
returned
to
federal
court
on
the
21st
seeking
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
this,
against
the
attachment.
that
hearings
by
the
way
which
was
not,
it
was
some
16
days
after
the
attorney
general's
office
and
other
defendants
had
entered
and
the
appearance
of
some
sort
anyway
and
that
hearing
in
federal
court
and
we
were
never
notified
of
the
second,
of
the
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order,
there
was
no
hearing
conducted
on
it
but
it
was
granted.
mr.
david
h.
young
that's
right
and
it's
that
aspect
of
the
confusion
why
in
our
abstention
argument,
we
put
it
under
several
different
sections
and
dealt
with
the
hicks
against
miranda
kind
of
an
issue
whether
a
federal
case
has
--
whether
a
state
court
proceeding
has
to
be
pending
before
there
are
substantial
proceedings
on
the
merit
and
in
federal
court
as
a
separate
issue.
when
we
say
there
was
--
we
say
we
would
have
it
either
way.
mr.
david
h.
young
oh
sure
yes,
without
question.
the
effect
of
that
temporary
--
the
relief
that
it
had
been
sought
immediately
as
a
result
of
that
second
suit
in
montgomery
county
was
to
have
child
placed
with
his
maternal
grandparents
where
he'd
been
staying
a
good
part
of
the
time
anyway
and
where
he'd
been
going
to
school,
because
they
resided
in
harris
county.
so
somehow
while
absenting
themselves
from
the
prospects
of
service
the
sims
did
find
out,
obviously
seek
out
some
relief
from
the
state
court
action.
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
confusion
that
results
because
the
family
code
contains
different
things.
and
one
of
the
things
that
is
so
confusing
in
the
first
federal
court
hearing
is
the
distinctions,
are
the
distinctions
between
venue
and
jurisdiction
on
the
one
hand
and
the
family
court's
concept
of
continuing
jurisdiction
on
the
other.
the
sims
has
argued
in
the
state
court
that
there
was
no
continuing
jurisdiction
in
that
case
in
harris
county
and
therefore
it
should
be
dismissed.
well,
continuing
jurisdiction
didn't
have
anything
do
to
with
this
case.
there
was
no
proceeding
already
pending
in
harris
county,
which
would
have
been
sufficient
to
give
the
montgomery
county
court
continuing
jurisdiction.
did
i
say
there
was
no
case
pending
in
montgomery
county,
which
would
--
to
which
the
harris
county
court
would
have
had
to
referred
it
back.
what
the
harris
county
court
did
was
take
these
arguments
that
both
sides
were
making
i.e.
the
fact
the
children
and
the
parents
both
reside
in
montgomery
county
and
realize
that
mandatorily
under
the
family
court
that
venue
was
in
montgomery
county
while
he
did
have
jurisdiction.
he
did
have
jurisdiction
and
he
says
in
his
deposition
it's
sufficient
to
enter
the
show-cause
order
that
he
did
and
transfer
it
back.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
know.
mr.
david
h.
young
okay.
maybe
the
last
thing
i
better
say
about
abstention
is
it
hicks
does
away
with
this
hicks
against
miranda
in
our
view
does
away
with
the
race
to
the
court
house
theory.
there's
no
issue
that
all
the
parties
had
actual
notice
in
federal
court
of
what
the
state
intended
to
do.
it
was
explicitly
addressed
to
the
judge,
we
think
he
consented
in
effect
to
it
and
in
any
event
there
is
no
finding
below
of
the
kind
of
bad
faith
or
harassment
that
would
be
necessary
to
overcome
the
abstention.
there's
not
even
a
bad
faith
allegation
in
the
pleadings,
there's
one
harassment
allegation
as
to
the
last
proceeding
in
montgomery
county.
no
findings
below
about
bad
faith
or
harassment
where
the
appellant
they're
not
--
i
realized
i've
used
up
virtually
all
of
my
time
on
only
one
of
the
three
big
issues
of
the
case.
i
can't
really
address
the
other
two
in
the
remaining
time.
so
i'd
like
to
just
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
and
abstention
will
solve
all
the
other
issues
if
it's
decided
our
way
anyway.
so
i
just
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
thank
you.
mr.
david
h.
young
yeah.
mr.
david
h.
young
not
that
i
recall,
i
recall
that
the
docket
sheets
are
something
were
entered
into
evidence
at
the
first
federal
court
hearing
but
i
don't
recall
that
the
pleadings
themselves
were
entered.
mr.
david
h.
young
not
that
i
recall.
mr.
david
h.
young
oh,
certainly.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
have
a
five
door
file
cabinet
full
of
the
things
and
i
am
sure
it's
in
there.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
don't
believe
so.
well,
there
are
many
things
in
this
case
we've
not
been
served
with
and
i
have
no
recollection.
mr.
david
h.
young
we
could
obtain
them
some
how
and
submit
them
to
the
court.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
like
the
–
mr.
david
h.
young
i
will.
mr.
david
h.
young
or
files
as
the
case
maybe.
our
files
there
maybe
more
files.
mr.
david
h.
young
state's
pleadings
are
in
the
record.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
believe
so.
mr.
david
h.
young
not
in
the
appendix
but
they
are
in
the
record,
i
understood
the
entire
record
is
in
there.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes,
i
believe
the
state's
pleadings
are
there,
i
just
do
not
specifically
recall
that
the
habeas
--
mr.
david
h.
young
i
just
now
have,
i
am
just
reluctant
to
say
this
because
i
can't
specifically
remember
like
i
do
remember
the
state's
pleadings.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
can
get
whatever
files
harris
or
montgomery
county
have,
i
assume
that
--
mr.
david
h.
young
whichever
be
satisfied.
the
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
about
an
open
and
shut
case
on
habeas
after
ten
days
is
yes.
when
an
order
expires
by
the
statute
or
by
its
own
face,
habeas,
there
is
no
need
to,
you
can
draft
a
habeas
petition
in
any
form
you
want
and
when.
mr.
david
h.
young
but
not
in
the
court
of
civil
appeal,
likewise
a
mandamus
action
for
instance
against
a
clerk
would
be
brought
in
the
district
court
against
a
judge,
it
can
be
brought
in
the
supreme
court
with
original
jurisdiction,
you
just
have
to
get
in
the
right
place.
the
issue
as
to
why
counsel
at
this
argument
right
here,
kept
saying
that
the
cases
were
transferred
from
harris
county
to
montgomery
county
because
harris
county
didn't
have
jurisdiction,
that's
not
why
they
were
transferred.
they
were
transferred
because
harris
county
didn't
have
venue,
harris
county
did
have
jurisdiction,
all
that,
all
the
rationale
for
that
is
in
judge
lowy's
deposition,
which
is
also
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
david
h.
young
that
is
correct
we
are
not
appealing
that.
instead
of
answering
some
of
the
questions,
the
pictures
are
all
of
one
child,
paul
sims.
two
were
taken
by
the
child
welfare
worker.
three,
by
the
police
officer
at
the
hospital,
i
don't
recall,
which
is,
whether
it's
two
and
three
or
three
and
two,
but
they
are
all
of
the
same
child,
all
within
a
very
short
span
of
time.
the
result
of
the
federal
court
taking
the
view
it
did
on
abstention
is
of
course
that
appellees
get
to
litigate
their
constitutional
claims,
but
nobody
ever
gets
a
hearing
on
the
merits
about
what
happened
to
this
child
or
these
children.
that's
what
the
state
was
after,
that's
what
the
state
repeatedly
tried
to
get
before
the
federal
court.
the
state
even
asked
the
federal
court
to
being
there
and
seeing
how
things
were
going,
they
even
asked
the
federal
court
to
appoint
an
ad
litem
for
the
child
and
it
was
denied,
saying
in
affect
why
don't
you
apply
the
same
standard
to
yourself
that
you
want
us
to
follow
with
regard
and
the
court
didn't
do
it.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
motion
to
modify,
appellants
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
the
appellants
are
not
the
judge
nor
are
they
the
district
court,
normal
procedure
in
texas
is
if
you
file
a
pleading
that
requires
a
hearing
is
that
would
you
go
to
the
judge;
any
judge
that
was
there
in
harris
county
could
have
heard
it.
it
was
true
apparently
that
the
judge
that
was
there
was
reluctant
to
hear
it,
but
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
appellees
went
to
him
and
asked
him
to
hear
it.
there
is
no
indicate,
all
of
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary
that
they
fled
montgomery
county
to
keep
from
having
to
hearing.
they
said
there
is
no
hearing
where
they
could
raise
all
the
issues,
well
the
last
thing
they
wanted
was
a
hearing
in
montgomery
county.
they
didn't
go
to
work.
the
didn't
send
the
kids
to
school
and
they
couldn't
be
found.
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
an
emergency
order
is
appealed
below
and
submit
is
answered
by
appellees
own
case.
the
rew
cite
that
i
gave
you
earlier
was
in
the
woods
case,
it
says,
at
page
575
in
volume
545
of
southwest
second.
an
appeal
could
have
been
taken
from
the
emergency
order
even
though
the
appeal
would
not
have
stayed
the
order
citing
section
1707
of
the
family
code.
mr.
david
h.
young
rew
is
the
state
court
version
of
the
woods
case,
which
was
temporarily
consolidated
with
this
one
and
is
now
no
longer
consolidated.
it
reversed
the
termination
of
criminal
rights
in
that
case,
but
it
was
on
the
factual
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
there
is
a
split
in
the
different
courts
of
civil
appeals
in
texas
as
to
whether
or
not
all
such
temporary
custody
orders
are
appealable
or
not.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
suggest
it
should
and
that's
the
place
to
resolve
it
and
like
this
court
one
of
the
ways
to
get
to
the
texas
supreme
court
is
when
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuit
so
to
speak,
that's
where
that
issue
should
be
resolved.
with
regard
to
canris,
the
child
abuse
and
neglect
report
and
inquiry
system,
the
district
court
didn't
say,
the
district
court's
opinion
is
not
even
internally
consistent
on
this
point,
i
don't
believe,
they
didn't
say
we
couldn't
make
the
investigations.
they
didn't
say
we
couldn't
keep
accusatory
files.
they
said
we
could
keep
investigated
files,
what
they
said
was,
you
can't
store
it
and
retrieve
it
electronically,
that's
all,
that's
all
the
opinion
means
on
the
child
abuse
and
neglect
report
and
inquiry
system
and
that
is
if
we
are
here
talking
most
of
our
time
as
we
are
about
comity
and
federalism
and
allowing
the
state
to
go
about
its
own
business,
if
you
can't
keep
your
files
in
the
medium
over
your
own
choosing,
then
the
federal
courts
have
gone
to
meddling.
mr.
david
h.
young
no,
the
normal
course
in
texas
is
if
someone
files
a
petition
asking
for
relief
they
go
to
the
judge
to
the
clerk
and
get
a
hearing
on
it,
and
the
sims
filed
that
petition
and
never
asked
for
a
hearing
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
david
h.
young
it
is
still
there.
mr.
david
h.
young
and
they
were
returned
so
long
ago
that
it's
problematic
whether
we
could
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
david
h.
young
that's
one
of
our
contentions,
yes.
the
passage
of
time
is
just,
we
didn't
ask
for
termination
in
the
first
place
and
when
we
were
only
seeking
temporary
conservatorship
over
child
to
try
to
give
him
some
help
while
he
needs
it.
then
once
the
time
is
passed
where
he
needed
it,
there
is
not
much
point
is
us
trying
to
do
anything.
