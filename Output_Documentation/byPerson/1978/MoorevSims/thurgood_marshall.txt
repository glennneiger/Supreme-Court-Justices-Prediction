to
the

for
the
modifying
the
--
.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
not
the
only
point
that's
not
clear.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
on
the
9th?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
temporary
restraining
order
you
were
--
but
you
were
notified
after
it
was
granted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
the
judge
wasn't
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
clear?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
they
weren't
permitted
to
file
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
house
was
open.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
they
tended
the
paper
with
the
right
fees
couldn't
they
file
any
paper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean
supposedly,
it's
either
permissible
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
were
they.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
why
were
they
denied
the
right
to
file.
justice

marshall
do
i
have
to
accept,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
were
denied
the
right
to
file.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
we
take
your
word
for
it,
if
it
is
not
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
put
it
straight
away,
the
one
that
you
didn't
file?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
you
do
that
then
and
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
see
what
confuses
me?
on
one
page,
you
say
it
wasn't
filed.
and
the
next
page
it
said,
it
was
filed
and
transferred
to
montgomery.
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
couldn't
have
been
in
montgomery
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
have
asked
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
texas
law
you
filed
your
original
writs
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
is
that
statutory
provision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
filed
it
in
a
district
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have
gone
with
the
montgomery
county,
couldn't
you?
couldn't
you
have
filed
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
montgomery
county
on
may
4th?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
particular
case,
could
you
have
not
file
the
petition
that
you
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
couldn't
you
have
filed
it
into
montgomery
county
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
why
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
jurisdiction
over
that
case?
didn't
it
tell
you
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
court
of
civil
appeals
do
to
your
petition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
it
didn't
have
jurisdictions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
from
that
moment
on,
did
you
ever
go
to
the
court
house
in
montgomery
county
for
any
purpose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
my
question
was
did
anybody
represent
these
children,
the
parents
or
anybody
in
the
family,
at
anytime
go
to
the
court
house
where
this
case
was
transferred
and
ask
anybody
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
answer
is
nobody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you're
saying
all
these,
well
i
don't
know
about
who
didn't
go,
i
want
to
know
who
did
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
the
parents
come
and
get
it
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
could
have
gone,
the
case
would
have
gone
to
montgomery
county.
justice
thurgood
marshall

where
montgomery
county

thurgood
marshall
