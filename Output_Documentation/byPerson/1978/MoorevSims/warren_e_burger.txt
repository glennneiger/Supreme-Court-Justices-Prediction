chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
moore
against
sims,
mr.
young;
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
young,
you've
only
got
a
couple
of
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
to
get
to
the
heart
of
your
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
porter.
at
sometime,
perhaps
the
earlier
the
better,
it
will
be
interesting
at
least
to
me
to
have
you
give
me
your
version
of
the
facts
very
briefly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happened
when
was
this
child
picked
up,
why,
and
then
how
soon
after
that
were
these
proceedings
begun?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
concede
this
was
an
emergency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
primarily
that's
a
matter
for
the
state
court
says
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
was
this
particular
child
picked
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
soon
after
they
were
taken
into
custody
was
there
a
medical
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
they
not
buttressed
also
by
the
doctor's
examination,
which
said
that
there
had
clearly
been
a
case
of
child
abuse?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
have
been
a
sufficient
remedy
at
that
point?
your
question
was
whether
the
state
of
texas
had
lawful
custody
and
your
client
said
the
state
does
not
have
lawful
custody
and
why
couldn't
you
resolve
the
constitutional
questions
in
that
proceedings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
it
not
be
filed
in
montgomery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
up
to
now
you
haven't
given
me
any
linkling
of
why
this
matter
could
not
have
been
settled
in
the
state
courts
where
custody
of
children
is
normally,
the
kind
of
problems
that
are
settled
there.
up
to
this
point,
i
haven't
any
idea
of
why
a
federal
court
should
be
in
this
case
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
confess
i
can't
escape
the
feeling
on
this
record
including
the
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
district
court,
that
some
people
were
more
interested
in
a
constitutional
case
than
in
trying
to
do
something
to
take
care
of
these
children.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
are
these
children
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
--
how
long
were
they
in
the
custody
of
the
state
approximately.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
42
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
that
time
they
probably
were
healed
of
the
very
serious
wounds
that
are
shown
in
these
photographs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
federal
court
or
state
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
your
time
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
entire
file.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
your
files.
i
want
just
the
files
in
the
original
records.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
moot
now,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
