the
two
brought
by
state
agency,
both
in
harris
county
one
transferred
to
some
other—

habeas
proceeding
brought
by
the
sims
in

county
also
transferred
to
montgomery,
is
that
it?
justice

stewart
now
the
initial
order

state
agency
proceeding

it?
justice
potter
stewart
i

with
the
expiration
of
the
order,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
in
your
abstention
argument
what
state
proceedings
as
pending
do
you
rely
upon?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
confused
with
these
numbers.
justice
potter
stewart
which
state
proceedings—
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
pending
you
say
when
the
federal
suit
was
brought.
you
said
earlier
–
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
you
say
the
second
state
agency
proceeding
which
they
brought
in
harris,
transferred
to
montgomery
that
certainly
was
a
pending
proceeding—
justice
potter
stewart
as
was
the
habeas,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
are
these
pictures
in
the
appendix
or
those
are
the
pictures
were
they
taken
that
very
day?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
about
one
child
or
all
three
in
inspection?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
are
rather
telling
aren't
they,
exhibits
of
child
abuse?
justice
potter
stewart
where
those
ex
parte
orders
appealable?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
start,
do
we
by
chance
have
any
of
the
state
court
appealing
today,
the
state
court
proceedings
in
the
file
here?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
in
the
court
of
civil
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
young
section
10
of
the
judgment
says
that
section
3408
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
so
far
as
it
fails
required
reports
and
records
of
child
abuse
and
neglect
and
so
forth,
he
made
available
to
the
parents
the
subject
of
investigation,
do
i
correctly
understand
you
are
not
appealing
from
that.
