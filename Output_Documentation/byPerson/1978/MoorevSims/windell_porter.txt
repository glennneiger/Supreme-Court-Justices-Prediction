ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
all
right
sir.
i'll
do
that.
let
me
state
at
the
outset
sir
that
we
realized
and
we
submit
and
acknowledge
that
there's
a
compelling
state
interest
in
a
state
being
able
to
pickup
children
in
emergency
situations.
ms.
windell
porter
no
sir,
i
do
not
concede
that
this
is
an
emergency,
what
we
concede
to
sir
is
that
there's
an
interest
here
on
the
part
of
the
state
that
if
in
fact
there
were
any
children
at
any
particular
time
now
or
even
then
in
danger
of
any
harm
that
that
state
has
an
interest
in
being
able
to
take
those
children
into
custody.
ms.
windell
porter
that
particular
yes
sir
is,
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
what
happened
after
the
children
were
taken
into
custody.
ms.
windell
porter
right
sir.
on
march
25th
just
briefly,
a
referral
was
made
to
the
child
welfare
department.
the
child
was
picked
up,
three
of
the
children
were
picked
up
not
just
paul,
the
referral
was
only
in
respect
to
paul.
on
march
26,
there
was
a
suit
that
was
filed
for
protection
of
the
child,
supposedly
with
the
referral
only
as
to
paul;
the
suit
was
filed
in
relationship
to
all
three
of
the
children.
on
march
26th,
the
first
ex
parte
order
was
issued
by
the
judge.
ms.
windell
porter
sir,
there
was
the
child
--
the
children
were
taken
to
the
hospital
that
very
day.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
when
those
pictures
were
taken.
those
pictures
were
stipulated
into
evidence.
i
would
assume
and
usually
in
the
regular
course
of
business
that
on
when
child
welfare
picks
up
the
children
that
the
pictures
are
usually
taken
at
that
same
time,
well,
this
is
just
something
from
me.
ms.
windell
porter
sir,
i
believe
that
those
pictures
are
only
of
one
child.
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
or
not
some
of
them
are
all
three,
but
i
believe
that
there
only
as
to
the
one
child
and
that
is
to
the
boy
child
paul.
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
they
were
buttressed
by
an
affidavit
by
the
doctor.
however,
there
was
never
any
testimony
because
there
was
never
any
court
hearing.
usually,
what
occurs
is
when
these
particular
suits
are
filed
there's
usually
an
affidavit
presented
to
the
judge
by
the
social
worker
or
by
the
attorney
from
child
welfare,
which
states
what
the
result
of
the
doctor's
examination
is.
on
march
31st,
the
appellees
went
in
and
sought
to
modify
the
march
26th
ex
parte
order.
that
order
lasted
no
longer
than
10
days.
after
the
expiration
of
that
order
pursuing
to
the
texas
family
court,
the
judge
was
to
do
either
one
of
two
things.
order
the
children
restored
to
the
parents
or
direct
child
welfare
or
its
attorneys
to
a
file
a
suit
affecting
parent-child
relationship.
on
march
31st
the
appellees
went
into
court
to
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i'm
sorry,
i
left
out
one
fact
about
the
march
31st
order.
the
motion
to
modify,
they
were
not
even
allowed
to
file
that
particular
motion.
we
feel
that
was
effectively
denying
them
any
particular
access.
ms.
windell
porter
sir,
in
the
request
for
admission,
it
states
and
admits
that
the
motion
was
stamped
by
the
clerk.
they
say
that
the
judge
was
not
there,
but
then
the
motion
was
returned
back
to
appellees.
they
were
not
even
allowed
to
file
to
leave
it
there
and
to
set
a
hearing
for
another
time.
ms.
windell
porter
i
believe
sir
that
it
is
clear
from
the
request
for
admissions
that
are
in
the
--
ms.
windell
porter
it
is
not
clear
sir
from
any
testimony,
it's
just
--
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
supposedly
sir,
they
were
supposed
to
be
able
to
file
--
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir,
they
should
have
been
able
to
file
it
however
--
ms.
windell
porter
no,
sir
they
will
not
commit
to
that
file.
ms.
windell
porter
i
do
not
know
sir,
the
judge,
he
was
not
there.
ms.
windell
porter
no
sir.
only
the
admittance
--
ms.
windell
porter
let
me
see
this
thing
sir.
only
the
admittance
that
it
was
stamped
and
returned
to
the
attorney
for
appellees
and
the
usual
practice
is
that
if
it's
stamped
it's
received
and
if
the
judge
is
not
there
then
what
they
would
do
would
be
to
set
a
hearing
on
it
later
on.
then
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed
on
march
31st.
the
writ
was
denied,
the
judge
would
not
rule
on
the
writ,
because
he
said
that
he
lacked
jurisdiction,
because
the
appellees
were
resident
of
montgomery
county.
after,
on
that
same
day
sir,
later
on
another
suit
was
filed
concerning
--
affecting
the
parent-child
relationship.
that
suit,
along
with
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
what
was
transferred
to
montgomery
county.
ms.
windell
porter
the
one
sir,
of
march
31st
that
the
judge
refused
to
act
on
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
no
sir.
what
the
clerk
refused
--
i
understand.
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir.
let
me
see
if
i
can
clarify
this.
ms.
windell
porter
the
march
31st
order
was
not
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
that
motion
was
a
motion
to
modify
the
march
26
ex
parte
order
where
the
judge
took
custody
of
the
children
for
the
ten-day
period.
after
not
being
permitted
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
march
31st
motion
to
modify
the
march
26
ex
parte
order,
they
then
went
back
and
attempted
to
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
because
at
that
time
the
ex
parte
order
pursuant
to
the
texas
code
of
civil
procedure
had
expired
because
it
only
lasts
for
10
days.
after
refusing
to
rule
on
the
writ
because
of
lack
jurisdiction,
then
the
case
was
transferred
to
montgomery
county
along
with
a
second
suit
that
was
filed
on
the
very
same
day
that
the
parents
were
in
court,
trying
to
have
a
hearing
on
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
all
of
this
was
transferred
to
montgomery
county
on
april
5th.
it's
really
interesting
to
know
that
although
the
parents
had
been
in
the
court
room
that
there
was
still
no
effort
to
even
notify
them
about
the
second
ex
parte
order
that
was
issued.
front
of
that,
that
order
stated
that
a
show
cause
hearing
would
be
held,
that
is
stated
in
blank.
it
didn't
say
when,
where,
who
or
what.
they
were
never
notified
of
that
order.
they
were
never
notified
of
that
particular
suit
for
whatever
reasons.
the
appellee's
filed
their
original
complaint
in
federal
court
on
april
19th.
it
is
our
contention
that
there
was
no
pending
state
court
proceeding
in
which
to
the
appellee's
could
have
litigated
their
constitutional
claims
by
way
of
a
defense.
ms.
windell
porter
sir,
there
was
no
action
although
it
was
transferred.
there
was
no
action
taken
by
the
montgomery
county
court
to
set
a
hearing.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know
and
from
the
record,
they
made
attempts
to
ask
for
a
hearing.
ms.
windell
porter
it's
purely
speculative
sir.
they
talk
about
the
people
going
from
one
place
to
another
and
trying
to
find
out
what
was
happening
in
montgomery
county.
ms.
windell
porter
no
sir.
they
were
not
appealable;
they
are
interlocutory
decisions.
further
as
a
matter
of
texas
state
law,
if
a
person
wants
to
raise
the
questions
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
state
of
seizure
of
children,
they
cannot
raise
them
even
on
appeal,
and
the
case
is
in
rew.
we
believe
that
this
court's
ruling
in
gerstein
versus
pugh
is
applicable
in
this
particular
case.
there
was
nowhere
for
them
to
go.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
the
only
thing
that
they
would
have
been
able
to
do
and
they
would
not
had
been
able
to
raise
their
constitutional
questions
or
the
issues
of
constitutional
law
in
either
a
writ
of
mandamus
or
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
which
are
the
two
things
because
the
writ
of
mandamus
sir,
would
have
dealt
with
whether
or
not
the
release
sought,
or
whether
or
not
the
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
say
if
a
writ
of
mandamus
had
been
filed
for
the
clerk
not
receiving
the
motion
to
modify,
or
for
the
judge
not
to
have
any
hearing
on
the
motion
to
modify.
and
of
course,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
will
only
deal
with
who
had
legal
custody.
ms.
windell
porter
let
me
state
this
sir.
on
may
4th,
they
made
another
attempt
for
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals,
and
that
motion
for
leave
to
file
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
denied.
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir.
on
this
particular
one.
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir,
it
is.
ms.
windell
porter
they
did
attempt
sir
to
file
it
in
the
district
court
in
the
harris
county
district
court
and
that
was
where
his
honor
refused
to
even
rule
on
the
writ
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
because
the
family
were
residents
of
montgomery
county.
ms.
windell
porter
if
sir,
there
was
any
pending
proceeding.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
they
had
the
choice.
ms.
windell
porter
yes.
however
they
had
a
choice
as
to
which
court
to
go
to.
ms.
windell
porter
because
sir,
as
the
statute
permits,
they
chose
to
file
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
with
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
which
had
jurisdiction
over
the
montgomery
county
court,
since
they
were
all
in
the
same
area.
ms.
windell
porter
no
sir.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
would
have
had
jurisdiction.
ms.
windell
porter
the
court
of
civil
appeals
refused
to
even
let
them
file
it.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
no
reasons
were
given
for
the
refusal
to
file.
there
was
no
action
taken
in
montgomery
county
by
the
montgomery
county
court
until
may
14th
of
1976,
and
then
on
may
21st
there
was
hearing
then
set
for
may
21st.
it
appears
so
that
the
burden,
the
state
was
putting
the
burden
on
the
family
to
go
in
and
to
accord
themselves
a
hearing.
the
interest
that
the
states
sought
to
protect,
there
was
no
danger
to
them.
as
all
of
the
time
the
children
were
in
the
custody
of
the
state
and
i
might
point
out
that
even
though
the
case
was
transferred
to
montgomery
county
where
no
action
was
taken
in
montgomery
county
and
it
was
transferred
with
a
show
cause
hearing
that
the
children
remained
in
the
custody
for
the
entire
42-day
period
of
the
harris
county
child
welfare.
ms.
windell
porter
apparently
sir,
and
this
is
just
information,
this
is
not
in
the
record.
there
was
much
stipulation
and
very
little
testimony.
however
sir,
apparently,
there
were
attempts
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
in
montgomery
county.
when
the
case
was
transferred,
it
was
transferred
by
judge
lowy,
who
was
the
harris
county
district
judge
with
an
order
on
it
that
a
show
cause
hearing
would
he
held.
and
in
accordance
with
texas
civil
procedure,
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
family
code,
that
show
cause
hearing
should
have
been
held
by
the
montgomery
county
court
within
ten
days
of
the
issuance
of
that
order,
however
it
was
not.
ms.
windell
porter
that's
when
the
decision
was
sir
to
go
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
no
reason
was
given
for
that
refusal
to
let
them
file
that
writ.
we
do
contend
that
there
was
no
pending
proceeding,
appellant
relies
very
heavily
on
younger
versus
harris.
however
--
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor
it
is
on
the
docket.
ms.
windell
porter
no,
sir.
i
will
have
to
speak
sir,
i
was
not
counsel
at
that
state,
i
will
have
to
speak
from
my
conversations
with
the
attorney
--
ms.
windell
porter
yes,
sir,
it
just
states
briefly
that,
that
the
children
were
wrongfully
in
the
custody
of
the
harris
county
child
welfare,
the
constitutional
issues
are
not
raised,
and
i
would
think
sir
that
--
ms.
windell
porter
yes,
sir.
they
–-
ms.
windell
porter
they
could
have
been
raised,
however
sir,
general
as
far
as
writs
of
habeas
corpus
are
concerned
it
just
deals
with
custody
and
he
has
the
right
to
--
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir,
except
that
at
that
point
and
even
at
the
point
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
writ,
there
was
no
pending
state
proceeding
both
of
the
--
ms.
windell
porter
both,
the
first
one,
but
on
may
4th
when
they
filed
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
there
was
no
proceeding
that
was
pending,
in
order
for
them
to
avail
themselves
of
and
i
would
think
that
the
younger
doctrine
and
those
related
cases
at
least
contemplate
that
the
individuals,
that
the
litigants
have
some
reasonable
way,
some
means,
some
real
valid
means
of
being
able
to
raise
their
constitutional
issues.
i'd
like
to
speak
a
little
about
the
canris
statue
and
that
is
the
process
that
the
state
gathers
information
concerning
abuse
or
alleged
abuse
of
children.
this
statue
does
not
provide
for
the
persons
even
finding
out
what
information
is
alleged.
there
is
no
opportunity
there
for
the
persons
to
correct
the
information.
ms.
windell
porter
i
understood
sir,
that
and
it
could
be
that
i
misunderstood
him,
i
thought
sir
that
he
was
saying
that
they
were
not
appealing
that
section
of
chapter
34,
which
that
deals
with.
ms.
windell
porter
the
failure
to
give
notice
to
the
parents,
but
that
failure
to
give
notice
to
the
parents
sir
that
he
is
referring
to
is
the
failure
to
give
notice
to
the
parents
when
say
child
welfare
is
going
in
and
requesting
an
order,
which
could
issue
without
notice
and
without
a
hearing
to
have
either
the
children
or
the
parents
examined.
and
i
thought
that,
that
was
what
he
was
alluding
to.
i
do
know
that
the
state
has
put
in
their
brief
that
canris
does
not
injure
persons.
we
feel
that
it
does
because
there
is
no
way,
there
is
no
opportunity
for
them
to
correct
any
information
and
we
would
think
that
there
should
be
provided
at
least
some
type
of
opportunity.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
the
reasons
are
because
there
was,
there
was
no
pending
action,
both
of
the
orders
had
expired.
the
montgomery
county
court
although
they
were
bound
to
have
a
show
cause
hearing
within
ten
days
and
i
would
say
even
the
harris
county
court
would
be
bound,
since
it
was
the
judge
in
harris
county
who
issued
that
ex
parte
order
and
the
show
cause
hearing.
that
those
are
the
reasons
why
it
could
not
be
resolved,
there
was
nothing
there,
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
i
do
not
have
any
knowledge,
sir
of
whether
or
not
that
is
true,
it
just
appears
to
me
that
the
state
with
all
of
it's
resources
were
putting
the
burden
on
the
appellant,
the
appellees
to
raise
or
to
find
ways
of
having
a
hearing.
there
was
a
total
of
42
days
here,
that
transpired.
the
only
hearing
that
was
held
was
the
one
on
april
5th
in
which
the
case
was
transferred
from
harris
to
montgomery
county.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
i
will
just
state
what
has
been
relayed
to
me.
as
far
as
i
understand
and
it
is
not
in
the
record.
unless
it
is
in
the
deposition
of
ms.
gladys
goffney,
who
was
the
attorney
at
that
time,
that
efforts
were
made
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
in
montgomery
county.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
i
cannot
say
specifically
from
my
own
knowledge
that
happened
in
respect
to
the
parents.
let
me
state
as
in
respect
to
the
children
that
had
an
attorney
been
appointed
to
represent
the
interest
of
the
children
at
the
initial
--
ms.
windell
porter
no,
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
not
as
to
the
parents.
ms.
windell
porter
as
far
as
i
know,
no
one
sir.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
at
that
particular
time,
the
only
person,
or
the
only
persons
whom
we
feel
were
adequately
represented
possibly
at
that
time
were
the
parents,
because
there
was
no
attorney
appointed
and
the
texas
statue
did
not
require
the
appointment
of
an
attorney
to
represent
the
children.
yes,
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir,
except
that
here
–-
ms.
windell
porter
they
could
have
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
the
children
sir,
were
ordered,
returned
to
their
parents
by
the
federal
court.
ms.
windell
porter
they
were
in
the
custody
of
the
state
for
42
days.
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
district
court's
opinion
that
the
court
does
state
that
there
was
never
any
evidence
to
show
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
abuse
by
the
parents.
one
of
the
things
that
happened
immediately
before
the
referral
was
made
was
that
the
father
was
at
the
school
and
he
saw
the
child
poking
a
pencil
at
a
little
girl
and
he
told
him
to
stop
and
the
child
did
not
stop
and
he
paddled
the
child
in
the
presence
of
the
teacher.
now
paul
has
stated
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
that
he
was
paddled
after
his
father
left
by
the
teacher
who
wanted
to
paddle
him
some
more
and
i
would
just
once
again
say
that
there
was
no
determination
by
the
federal
district
court
and
no
evidence
presented
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
child
abuse
and
i
suppose
that
that
would
be
something
that
would
be
issued,
an
issue
in
any
pending
state
litigation.
let
me
say
this
on
the
woods
case
if
i
may.
i
know
what
has
become
of
the
woods
case
because
i
represent
ms.
woods
again
after
the
court
of
civil
appeals
returned
the
child,
child
welfare
reinstituted
an
action
against
her
and
that
case
is
now
pending,
there
is
a
final
hearing
now
pending
that
case.
ms.
windell
porter
in
state
court
sir.
and
i
think
that,
the
other
thing
that,
the
other
reason
why
habeas
corpus
or
any
remedy
say
if
there
had
been
any
pending
proceeding
would
not
be
available
was
because
in
texas
by
statute
the
ex
parte
orders
maybe
stepped,
in
other
words
if
one
goes
into
court
and
obtains
a
restraining
order
or
an
ex
parte
order,
the
statute
fails
to
say
how
many
you
can
have,
however
appellants
have
conceded
to
that
affect
and
they
are
not
contesting
that,
but
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
an
issue
at
that
particular
time
because
the
court
at
that
time
had
not
made
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
stacking
where
one
order
could
be
issued
immediately
almost
after
another
order
had
been
expired
was
unconstitutional
either
on
its
face
or
as
applied.
the
other
thing
is
and
i
think
that
what's
happening
with
mr.
woods
is
that
this
shows
the
likelihood
of
what
may
reoccur
again.
this
is
not
an
isolated
instance.
appellant
stated
that
the
children
are
presented
to
the
court.
they
are
not
presented
to
the
court,
there
was
no
presentation
here.
as
i
said
before
we
are
not
saying
that
if
in
the
event
that
there
is
child
abuse,
that
children
should
not
be
taken
into
custody
but
we
are
hoping
and
we
are
saying
that
should
they
be
taken
into
custody
then
because
of
the
fundamental
rights
involved
because
of
the
reciprocal
rights
between
parents
and
children
that
a
hearing
should
be
held
and
that
hearing
should
be
held
immediately
in
order
to
make
some
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
validity
say
to
the
referral.
this
was
not
there,
by
immediately
sir,
i
would
say
as
soon
as
practically
possible.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor
if
i
may,
there
were
two
judgments
and
yes
they
did
hold
sir
the
same
day.
however
in
the
appendix,
in
letters
passed
between
the
appellants
and
the
court,
it
does
state
and
it
does
interpret
that
immediately
or
the
same
day
has
been
interpreted
and
agreed
to
be
24
hours.
the
texas
department
of
human
resources
has
gone
as
far
as
issuing
directives.
i
myself
try
these
cases
and
we
know
that
they
have
these
hearings
within
24
hours.
ms.
windell
porter
your
honor,
there
are
two
answers
to
that
question.
one
would
be
i
suppose
that
because
of
the
circumstances
involved
it
should
still
be
immediately.
the
other
would
be
to
have
the
hearing
on
the
next
business
or
the
next
court
day
but
it
should
be
as
soon
as
practically
possible.
ms.
windell
porter
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
ms.
windell
porter
yes
sir,
conroe
is
a
city
in
montgomery
county.
okay
thank
you.
for
those
reasons
i
would
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
three
judge
district
court.
