montgomery
county
had
joined
harris
on
the
north.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
so
view
it
that
would
no
more
have
been
pending
in
the
first
one,
they'd
be
precisely
of
the
same
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
couldn't
the
other
side
argue
that
after
the
10
days
it
ran
on
till
april
16th
that
you
retained
custody
of
the
children
without
any
legal
support
for
what
you
are
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
if
you
rely
on
the
may
14th
action,
the
new
suit
brought
then
that
is
a
good
--
almost
a
month
after
the
federal
case
had
been
filed.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there
is
no
court
in
texas
that
would
entertain
a
claim
that
the
children
were
unconstitutionally
seized
and
retained
by
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel
is
your
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
â€“-
what
were
your
allegations
in
your
habeas
corpus
petition,
do
you
remember?
didn't
you
allege
unconstitutionality
in
your
habeas
corpus
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
ever
read
the
habeas
corpus
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
could
have
been
though,
i
suppose
right
there,
it
might
have
been
denied
but
you
could
have
raised,
you
could
have
alleged
them
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
had
been
denied
you
could
have
appealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know,
but
one
ground
for
alleging
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
to
you,
one
ground
for
claiming
illegal
custody
would
be
that
the
state
was
violating
the
constitution
by
holding
the
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
porter
i
understood
your
opponent
to
say
that
although
the
court
held
that
aspect
of
the
statue
unconstitutional
they
are
not
appealing
that
holding,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
failure
to
give
notice
to
the
parents.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
court
below
held
the
same
day,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
they
picked
up
on
saturday
night,
when
should
the
hearing
be
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
have
thought
that
might
have
been
quite
relevant
to
abstention
issues
to
what
the
pleadings
in
the
state
courts
were.
well,
but
you
don't
think
the
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
for
example
ever
got
into
the
record
in
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
they
are
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
have
copies
in
your
own
files
of
the
pleadings
in
the
state
cases
that
were
filed
by
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
were
probably
served
with
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
ways
apparently.
we
were
interested
in
getting
those
pleadings
as
its
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it'll
be
very
good,
it
was
an
inquiry.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
would
you
undertake
to
get
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
interested
--
for
myself,
i
am
interested
in
the
state's
pleadings,
and
any
answers
to
them
in
the
state
cases
and
in
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
that
was
filed.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
not
in
the
printed
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
entire
record
of
the
three
judge
court
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
make
the
federal
habeas
petition
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
we
should
examine
the
record
here
and
then
perhaps
request
from
counsel
copies
what
we
need.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you.
was
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
that
was
filed
initially
and
then
transferred
to
montgomery
county,
was
that
petition
ever
acted
on?
was
it
ever
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
still
sitting
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
if
the
children
were
ultimately
returned
anyway.
