justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
perfectly
clear
the
second
proceeding
was
pending
because
the
order
was
entered
as
i,
in
my
notice
showing
april
6,
and
wasn't
till
april
19th
that
the
federal
case
was
filed
and
there's
a
more
than
a
10
day
gap
and
had
anything
--
it
was
not
another
10
day
order
that
expired
by
its
terms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
you
didn't
â€“
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms
porter
like
did
justice
marshall,
i
don't
understand
why
nobody
on
behalf
of
the
parents,
when
the
children
are
out
of
their
custody
all
this
of
period
ran
into
the
---
why
didn't
they
go
to
the
montgomery
county
court
and
say,
hey,
i
want
our
children
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
it
wasn't
and
all
after
10
days,
it
seemed
to
be
an
open
and
shut
case
to
go
and
say
we
want
our
children
back,
and
they
were
not
being
held
with
any
lawful
authority
at
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
i
spoke
to
the
judge
on
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
said
well
why
they
don't
go
into
the
county
court
in
montgomery
county,
i
would
have
thought.
