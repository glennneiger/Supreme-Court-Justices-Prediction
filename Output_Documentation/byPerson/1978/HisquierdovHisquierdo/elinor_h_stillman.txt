ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
decision
here
on
review
directs
the
california
trial
court
in
these
divorce
proceedings
to
apply
california
community
property
law
to
annuity
payments
that
the
petitioner
is
going
to
--
is
expecting
to
receive
under
the
railroad
retirement
act
when
he
retires.
the
permitted
result
that
the
wife,
the
respondent
will
be
ordered
the
proportional
interest
in
those
payments
either
now
through
taking
the
interest
the
value
of
the
interest
out
in
other
property
or
the
later
time
through
talking
it
out
as
from
the
payments
says
they
mature
as
they
accrue.
we
submit
that
this
application
of
state
law
in
either
form
conflicts
with
the
retirement
act.
i
think
i
would
like
to
clarify
that
this
point
that
the
united
states
is
not
claiming
that
there
is
a
preemption
of
the
field
of
domestic
law
here.
we
look
at
this
more
narrowly
that
there
is
simply
a
conflict
between
terms
of
this
court
and
this
particular
application
of
california
law
to
these
annuity
payments
which
are
federal
benefit.
california
is
perfectly
entitled
to
set
up
a
scheme
similar
to
this
of
its
own
and
call
it
property
and
say
it
can
be
anticipated
and
treated
under
whatever
categories
it
wishes.
it
simply
can't
act
on
these
federal
payments.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
it
comes
out
in
a
form
from
the
u.s.treasury.
the
--
under
the
railroad
tax
act,
the
railroads
are
taxed,
the
individuals
are
taxed,
and
the
money
goes
in
to
the
railroad
retirement
account.
so
that
the
railroads
tax
funds
are
mingled
in
that
account
that
the,
this
man's
benefits
from
the
santa
fe
so
to
speak
are
not
segregated
in
the
account
that
the
railroad,
the
different
railroad
just
pay
into
the
fund
at
a
certain
tax
right.
i
might
say
you
were
asking
about
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
an
employees
tier
ii,
although
after
the
74
act
employees
only
pay
the
amount
on
their
earnings
that
they
would
pay
under
social
security
that's
all
they
pay.
the
so-called
“tier
ii”
benefit
which
is
the
staff
pension
on
top
of
this
basic
social
security
benefit
is
paid
entirely
by
railroad
taxes.
and
i
might
say
that
when
they
wrote
the
74
act
because
they
had
some
transition
provisions
to,
to
preserve
for
some
long-time
employees
some
benefits
that
they
were
phasing
out
and
there
was
a
cost
of
that
phase
out
congress
decided
to
let
the
u.s.
treasury
take
out
that
cost.
and
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
but
in
the
sense
that
that
the
--
but
it's
not
a
funded
scheme.
so
it
was
like
self
social
security
that
it
attempts
to
be
self-financing
but
basically
present
workers
are
paying
in
funds
that
present
retirees
are
receiving
and
there
is
no,
there
is
no
contribution
of
the
worker
that
segregated
there
that
his
contribution
in
which
he
has
equity
or
that
although
generally
there
are
certain
guarantees
that
that
the
eventual
payouts
would
equal
the
amount
that
he
had
paid
in
social
security
taxes
to
a
survivors
or
whatever
if
he
has
a
current
connection
with
the
railroad.
i
would
like
to
emphasis
though
that
our
case
does
not
really
absolutely
depend
on
the
nature
of
this
fund.
what
we're
really
relying
on
here
is
expressed
terms
of
the
railroad
retirement
act.
specifically
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
originally
instill
is
to
protect
these
funds
for
the
worker
and
to
determine
that
they
go
to
the
worker
alone
and
we're
also
relying
on
the
express
terms
of
title
45,
section
231m
which
is
the
anti-assignment
clause.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
we
think
congress
did
cut
this
deep
here
and
if
i
could,
i
could
address
the
particular
terms
which
i
think
show
that
attention
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
first,
the
annuity
payments
are
not
be
made
subject
to
legal
process
under
any
circumstance
whatsoever.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
think
that
to
allow
a
spouse
to
bring
the
workers
expected
future
annuity
payments
into
the
divorce
action
for
adjudication
which
is
what
she's
doing,
is
in
effect
to
subject
into
legal
process
and
we
think
this
is
so
whether
the
order
that
she
seeks
is
to
compel
a
transfer
of
the
equivalent
proportion
of
the
present
value
or
in
order
to
--
to
collect
out
of
the
funds
and
out
of
the
payments
as
their
later
paid
to
her.
second,
we
think
that
a
court
order
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
think
the
court
is
precluded
from
doing
that
by
the
anticipation
clause
and
by
this
legal
process.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
clause.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
don't
believe
the
record
shows
that,
it
would
be
rather
high
because
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--
because
he's
two
years
away
from
retirement,
two
or
three
years
away
from
retirement.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it
would
greatly
exceed
the
equity
that
l
believe
the
equity
in
the
house
was
approximately
$12,500.00
total
and
i'm
sure
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
take
a
proportional
value
of
that
pension
out
of
that
act.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
the
amount
that
he
will
receive?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
have
--
i
know
that
outside
the
record,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
believe
it's
something
in
excess
of
$700.00
a
month.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it
would
be,
it
would
be
very
high
and
there's
the
relationship
between
that
and
the
equity
that's
available
in
other
community.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
your
honor,
we
think
that
what
they
propose
to
do
is
to
use
that
amount
in
a
paper
transaction
here
to
offset
other
value
in
the
community.
we
think
that's
using
it
that
that's
anticipating
it,
as
if
it's
there.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
true
and
the
reason
they
could
this
by
way
of
alimony,
we
think
this
would
be
true
only
since
1975.
because
in
1975,
congress
by
enacting
in
the
social
security
act,
section
459
which
is
an
override
provision
that
overrides
the
anti-attachment
clause
such
as
this
said
that,
there
could
be
garnishment
of
such
funds
for
alimony
and
child
support.
we
think
that's
an
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
right.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
correct.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
think
they
can
do
since
1975.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
because
there
is
now
the
correct
one.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
certainly,
yes
and
that's
a
sensible
reflection
of
the
policy
which
congress
has
now.
i
think
probably
they
enacted,
it's
a
reasonable
assumption
that
they
enacted
that
statute
in
1975
to
avoid
the
harsh
result
which
should
otherwise
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it
certainly
does
because
in
1977
they
revised
the
--
they
didn't
revise,
they
clarified
the
definition
of
alimony
in
the
social
security
act
and
expressly
excluded
community
property
settlements
of
the
type
of
order
that
would
result
in
this
divorce
proceeding.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that
--
well
that
definition
applies
to
this
override
provision
which
by
its
terms
does
apply
to
benefits
under
the
railroad
retirement
act,
yes.
it
applied
--
it
overrode
a
number
of
federal
statutes
--
military
pay
a
number
of
them.
it
was
a
provision
affecting
any
number
of
federal
benefits.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
excuse
me,
your
honor?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well
that's,
that's
a
matter
for
congress
your
honor.
it's
a
judgment
that
they're
entitled
to
make.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
can't
say
your
honor
why
exactly
they
decided
to
stop
at
alimony
and
child
support
although
i
think
a
reasonable
view
would
be
that
when
you're
dealing
with
alimony
and
child
support,
you're
dealing
with
actual
need
and
congress
is
doing
a
balancing
here.
there
is
the
protection
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
not
necessarily
no,
as
i
understand
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it's
not
established
that
she
needs
it.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
she
has
her
own
earnings.
she
works
and
she'll
have
social
security
benefits
and
i'd
like
to
say
just
on
that
point,
i
would
to
make
this
clarification
for
the
record.
the
amicus
brief
now
and
the
respondent
both
said
that
she
would
be,
that
the
petitioner
would
be
entitled
to
take
his
entire
railroad
retirement
benefit,
and
then
claim
a
divorce
spouse's
benefit
based
on
her
earnings
under
the
social
security
act.
we
think
that
would
be,
it
would
be
ill-advised
of
him
to
try
that
because
if
he
gets
in
a
word
of
a
benefit
under
that
social
security
act,
there
is
an
offset
provision
in
the
railroad
retirement
act
which
would
require
that
his
railroad
benefit
be
reduced
to
the
amount
that
he
was
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
certainly.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
although
movie
actors
would
not
be
covered
by
this
act
but
we
would
just
say
that
congress
has
a
policy
here
that
they've
made
inroad
into
this
protection,
that
they've
established
for
this
payments
and
they've
only
gone
so
far
as
making
it
for
alimony
and
child
support.
they've
not
gone
further
to
extend
it
to
community
property
settlement.
we
would
say
of
cause
to
have
called
that
the
court's
attention
also
that
hr
8771
which
was
described
in
our
brief
at
page
23
and
it's
now
been
enacted
as
public
law
95-366.
in
the
civil
service
retirement
and
disability
program,
congress
has
now
gone
further
for
that
program
and
done
essentially
what
the
respondent
wants
the
court
to
allow,
to
have
done
by
application
of
state
law
to
this
statute
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no
this
is
something
else,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
refers
only
garnishment
but
we
think
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
act
in
the
light
of
that
now
instead
it
would
be
acceptable
to
consider
alimony
since
it
can
be
garnished.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
oh!
but
the
75
act
was,
as
i
said
clarified
by
a
redefinition
of
alimony
in
1977
which
applies
specifically
that
the
term
alimony
in
that
statute
and
they
defined
alimony
to
exclude
community
property
because
there
had
been
some
uncertainty
on
the
parts
of
some
of
the
court.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
true
but
we
think
that
there
still
can
be
no
anticipation.
are
you
talking
of
that
taking
into
account?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
say
simply
that
congress
has
this
other
options
and
the
options
that
they
chose
in
this
recent
retirement
civil
service
retirement
program
was
to
allow
garnishment
out
of
civil
service
pensions
for
community
property
rewards
is
well
as
divorce
and
as
alimony
judgments.
now
congress
may
wish
to
extend
that
to
this
act.
it
might,
they're
might
be
good
policy
reasons
for
them
to
do
it
but
we
simply
thank
that
that's
a
matter
for
congress
to
decide
and
not
a
matter
that
should
be
engrafted
under
the
statute
by
state
law.
we
think
that
the
court
recognized
that
in
the
case
of
free
v.
bland
when
it
said,
the
relative
importance
to
the
state
of
its
own
lies
not
material
when
there
is
a
conflict
with
a
valid
federal
law
for
the
framers
of
our
constitution
provided
that
the
federal
law
must
prevail.
therefore,
we
submit,
the
united
states
submits
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
should
be
reversed.
