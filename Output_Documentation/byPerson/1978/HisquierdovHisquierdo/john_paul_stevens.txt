justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
stillman,
on
that
point,
do
you
go
as
far
as
the
other
counsel
did
and
argued
that
the
divorce
court
may
not
even
take
in
account
in
figuring
out
what
will
be
a
fair
spouse's
award,
the
fact
that
such
a
benefit
will
in
the
future
be
available
to
the
husband?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fields
can
i
just
follow
up
on
one
thought.
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
you
of
what
in
your
view
the
word
“anticipated”
meant
and
i
didn't
understand
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that
may
be
a
reason
why
their
interpretation
is
wrong.
i'm
asking
you
what
your
interpretation
of
the
word
is.
do
you
have
it
or
do
you
think
it's
just
redundant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
it
means
anything
more
than
the
preceding
clause
which
refers
to
garnishment,
attachment
and
other
legal
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
answer
is
it's
totally
redundant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
kay,
as
another
way
of
stating
the
issue
you
say,
the
question
is
whether
the
present
value
of
the
pension
can
be
listed
as
a
community
asset.
could
it
also
be
correct
to
say
that
the
issue
is
whether
when
that
present
value
is
listed?
shall
it
be
listed
as
a
husband
asset
or
as
a
joint
asset?
isn't
that
another
way
of
stating
the
same
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
would
it
not
be
your
view
that
if
the
government
is
correct
here
and
of
course
it
has
not
been
decided,
that
all
that
would
mean
would
be
that
this
particular
asset
would
be
treated
in
the
total
picture
as
an
asset
belonging
to
the
husband.
it
could
still
be
taken
into
account
by
the
judge
in
making
whatever
alimony
or
support
or
whatever
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
a
--
may
not
--
maybe
i'm
just
terribly
ignorant
about
california
law.
i
would
mean
that
california
judge
could
not
even
take
into
consideration
the
separate
properties
and
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
but
he
could
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
your
opponent
said
he
could
not
and
i
just
want
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
i
guess
i
did
misunderstand.
that's
why
i'm
trying
to
get
help.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.kay,
let
me
interrupt
just
a
second,
you're
saying
that
they
void
the
--
they
voided
here
avoiding
the
congress
writing
a
federal
domestic
relations
law
but
really
you're
arguing
that
you
don't
want
this
property
to
be
substitute
to
any
domestic
relations
law.
you
want
it
to
be
the
dignity
of
a
community
property
law
rather
than
the
mercy
of
the
divorce
court
to
be
controlling
as
i
remember
you
were
saying?
