justice
potter
stewart
but
that
legislation
if
i
have
identified
it
correctly
as
specifically
applicable
only
to
civil
service
retirees
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
illustrates
that
congress
could
do
this
if
they
wanted
to.
justice
potter
stewart
well
but
this
does
not
involve
alimony
or
child
support?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whether
or
not
california
can
consider
this
community
property
and
that
is
the
only
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
it
is
community
property
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
justice
stevens
said
if
the
government
is
correct
in
this
case.
then
it's
a
husband's
assets
and
it
is
not
going
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
--
if
you're
correct
and
if
this
property
the
present
value
of
the
expectancy
is
therefore
properly
includable
as
property
of
the
community.
and
there
is
a
division
of
that
property
half-and-half
on
the
dissolution
of
the
marriage,
then
what
happens
if
two
weeks
after
the
husband
becomes
eligible
for
the
return
of
benefits,
he
dies.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
but
now
we're
talking
about
the
present
value.
justice
potter
stewart
at
which
is
let's
say,
$20,000.00
for
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
divided
in
half
and
the
wife
on
the
dissolution
of
the
marriage
therefore
gets
half
of
that
$10,000.00
or
whatever
it
is.
then
a
week
after
the
husband
becomes
eligible,
he
does
live
long
enough
to
become
eligible
but
he
promptly
dies.
she
still
has
the
$10,000.00?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
lived
by
my
--
in
my
hypothesis,
he
has
lived
that
long.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you're
correct,
the
judge
would
have
to
do
that.
if
this
is
community
property,
it's
an
asset.
its
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
income.
it's
an
asset.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
and
the
judge
if
you're
correct
could
simply
order
the
division
of
half
to
the
wife
on
the
solution
of
the
marriage
of
the
present
value
of
the
expectancy.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
she
got
that
then
the
--
she
could
keep
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
assuming
all
the
discounting
and
the
problem
--
justice
potter
stewart
unless
you
end
up
with
the
value
of
$20,000.00
and
you
divide
it
in
two.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
my
brother
stevens'
point
is
that
community
property
law
is
property
law.
it's
not
confined
to
divorce
situation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
very
app
--
it's
certainly
but
it's
applicable
in
terms
of
inheritance
and
bequest
and
all
sorts
of
other
property
transactions
and
concepts.
and
if
you're
correct,
the
division
of
the
community
property
is
wholly
unrelated
to
need
to
be
true
of
both
these
people
were
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wholly
unrelated.
justice
potter
stewart
and
alimony
by
contract
has
to
do
with
or
spousal
support
as
you
call
it
in
california
has
to
do
with
need
and
ability
to
pay?
justice
potter
stewart
and
community
property
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
either?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
didn't
understand
the
government
to
be
saying
his
brief
with
what
you
understand
that
we're
saying
my
perception
of
it
was
that
the
government
simply
conceded
that
of
course
in
determining
whether
and
to
what
extent
and
what
amount
to
grant
an
alimony
award
or
spousal
support
award,
the
court
may
consider
the
ability
to
pay
of
the
husband
and
part
of
that
ability
to
pay
depends
upon
his
expectancy
of
retirement
that's
all
it
said.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
what
the
government
says
in
its
brief
lies
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
but
i
didn't
--
i
read
it
little
differently.
justice
potter
stewart
well
he
run
under
--
he
run
under
the
decision
of
flemming
against
nestor,
wouldn't
he
in
trying
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
statutory
entitlement
until
the
statute
is
amended.
