justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
endman,
isn't
the
only
issue
before
us
as
to
who
owns
the
retirement
benefit
before
it's
actually
paid?
that's
the
only
and
i
don't
think
we
even
have
the
issue
you
discussed
earlier
of
whether
the
judge
in
allocating
property
in
a
divorce
case
could
take
into
account
the
fact
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
benefit
sometime
down
the
road.
that's
not
before
us
either
is
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
who
owns
the
benefit.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
question
is
whether
it
would
be
anticipation
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute
to
apply
the
community
property
law
and
say
it's
now
owned
half
by
the
wife
that's
whole
case,
is
it
not?
