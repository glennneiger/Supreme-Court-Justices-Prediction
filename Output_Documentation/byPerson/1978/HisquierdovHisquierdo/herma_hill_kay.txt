ms.
herma
hill
kay
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
fields
said
to
the
court
this
morning,
the
only
issue
before
this
court
in
this
case
is
whether
california
may
list
under
the
heading
of
community
assets
arising
from
this
marriage,
the
present
value
of
mr.
hisquierdo's
right
to
receive
in
the
future
benefits
attributable
to
his
work
during
the
marriage
and
payable
from
the
railroad
retirement
act.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
what
the
california
supreme
court
said
could
be
done
in
the
pension
cases
in,
in
re
marriage
of
brown
where
the
court
said
that
we
no
longer
had
to
wait
for
pension
rights
to
vest.
it
was
enough
if
there
was
a
right
attributable
to
work
perform
during
the
marriage
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
it
could
be
taken
into
account.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
your
honor,
if
the
gentleman
dies
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
if
the
gentleman
dies
or
indeed
in
a
private
pension
case,
if
he
leaves
employment
and
is
no
longer
entitled
under
the
private
plan
any
benefits,
then
the
court
has
to
retain
jurisdiction
on
the
theory
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
on
which
to
value
the
plan
and
the
court
can
do
that
and
does
do
it
quite
commonly
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
of
the
divorce
court,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
so
that
as
and
when
the
benefits
become
payable,
the
court
will
then
know
exactly
what
can
be
allocated
to
each
spouse.
so
that
if
for
example
in
this
case,
it
were
difficult
to
value
mr.
hisquierdo's
rights
in
the
railroad
retirement
benefits,
the
court
could
retain
jurisdiction
until
1981
when
he
is
scheduled
to
retire
could
then
award
the
wife
as
mr.
fields
said,
20%
of
the
share
of
the
benefits
and
could
order
mr.
hisquierdo
to
pay
them.
now
i'd
like
to
add
that
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
court
could
order
the
railroad
retirement
board
to
pay
them.
it
is
not
even
to
say
that
you
could
attach
those
benefits
in
mr.
hisquierdo's
hands.
it
is
merely
to
say
the
court
could
make
an
order
to
mr.
hisquierdo
that
this
amount
be
paid
to
his
wife.
that
is
commonly
done
your
honor
and
indeed
has
been
done
contrary
to
the
argument
that
mrs.
stillman
made
this
morning
in
cases
arising
under
the
predecessor,
the
section
231m,
namely
section
231l
of
the
railroad
retirement
act,
where
in
several
cases,
the
courts
took
into
account
the
value
of
the
railroad
retirement
benefits
and
both
alimony
and
child
support
situations
and
said
that
those
benefits
can
be
payable
even
though
the
specific
benefits
may
not
be
payable,
an
order
can
be
entered
against
the
broker
himself.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
correct,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
i
absolutely
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
think
the
1974
amendment,
the
1975
amendment
and
the
1977
definitional
amendment
are
totally
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
congressional
intent
in
this
case.
we
are
not
relying
on
any
need
on
the
part
of
the
wife.
we
are
relying
on
her
rights
as
an
owner
of
this
property.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
not
under
california
practice,
your
honor.
it
is
true
that
when
you
file
in
the
california
court
for
dissolution
of
marriage,
you
have
two
separate
forms,
the
petitioner
list
the
community
asset
of
the
marriage.
they
are
not
usually
listed
as
husband's
assets
or
wife's
assets.
they're
simply
listed
as
community
assets.
so
in
this
case,
as
indeed
happened
in
this
very
proceeding,
the
wife
would
list
under
community
assets,
husband's
railroad
retirement
benefits.
that
does
not
mean
that
they
belong
to
the
husband,
not
to
the
wife.
it
means
that
they
have
been
attributed
to
his
labor
during
the
marriage.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
no,
your
honor.
it
would
not
be
treated
as
an
asset
belonging
to
the
husband.
it
would
be
treated
if
you
please
as
an
asset
generated
by
the
husband's
work
during
marriage.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that
is
correct,
if
it
is
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon
here,
your
honor.
if
the
government
is
correct
then
it
is
not
a
community
asset
at
all.
if
the
government
is
corrected
as
separate
property
and
separate
property
is
not
subject
to
division
upon
dissolution
under
california
law.
so,
it
would
not
be
listed
at
all.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that
is
correct.
the
trial
court
judge
could
take
into
account
separate
property
only
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
an
alimony
award
but
not
for
the
purpose.
not
for
the
purpose
of
dividing
the
community
properly.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
yes,
he
could
do
that.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
no,
i
don't.
i
didn't
understand
my
opponent
to
say
that
your
honor.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
the
--
i
think
one
fundamental
point
that
that
has
been
overlooked
here,
the
chief
justice
put
his
finger
on
it
early
this
morning
by
asking
what
made
the
difference
whether
the
defendant's
spouse
took
this
property
as
community
property
or
as
an
alimony
award.
the
difference
that
makes
is
that
alimony
awards
are
traditionally
modifiable,
can
be
terminated.
alimony
rights
or
a
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
community
property
rights
are
not
so
that
there
is
a
great
deal
more
of
security
involved
for
the
dependent's
spouse
under
the
community
property
laws
and
being
able
to
say,
this
asset
is
property
right
and
not
simply
an
alimony
award.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
i
beg
you
pardon?
ms.
herma
hill
kay
they
are
generally
taxable
to
the
recipient,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
your
honor
that's
the
question
of
valuation
if
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
correct
and
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
if
for
example
the
court
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
no,
your
honor
in
the
case
that
you
pose,
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
his
living
until
the
pension
matures.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
trial
court
who
has
acted
presumably
before
the
husband
has
lived
to
the
time
in
your
hypothetical.
the
trial
court
realizing
that
the
husband
might
die
could
and
very
likely
would
simply
not
order
the
payment
to
the
wife
at
the
time
of
dissolution
of
$10,000.00
but
with
retained
jurisdiction
and
with
then
simply
began
ordering
the
husband
the
pay
to
the
wife
add
some
when
the
benefits
become
due,
20%
of
each
monthly
payments.
so
that
that
when
you
died,
since
the
fund
would
then
as
you
said
this
morning
revert
to
the
treasury
there
being
no
children
involved
in
this
case
then
the
wife
would
have
nothing
further
against
what
she
could
have
assert
the
community
interest.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that
is
correct
but
the
burden.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
hat's
correct.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
yes,
your
honor
he
could
do
that.
all
i'm
say
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
oh!
that's
absolutely
right.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
assumes
that
the
evaluation
is
certain
enough
to
be
divided
at
the
time
of
the
divorce.
it
would
have
to
be
discounted
under
actuarial
practices
to
take
account
of
this
life
expectancy.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
if
that's
true,
your
honor
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
true,
your
honor.
she's
lockout.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
correct.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
the
--
as
people
spend
more
of
their
working
time
accumulating
benefits
towards
retirement
and
specially
as
you
talked
about
families
where
there
is
only
one
spouse
working
outside
the
home
towards
the
end
of
a
lengthy
marriage,
it
is
very
lively
that
the
rights
and
the
pension
or
the
future
expectations
in
the
pension
will
be
the
single
largest
item
of
community
property
and
if
one
takes
account
of
that
is
alimony,
as
the
california
supreme
court
said
in
the
phillipson
case.
it
really
leaves
the
defendant
spouse
to
the
mercy
of
the
divorce
court
and
not
to
the
dignity
of
the
community
property
award.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
correct
your
honor
and
we
also
treat
good
will
attributable
to
legal
practice
as
community
property
even
though
it
can't
be
sold
by
the
lawyer.
now,
it
may
be
worth
emphasizing
what
the
issues
are
in
this
case,
now
that
i
think
we
have
discussed
what
the
issues
or
not.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
congress
in
enacting
the
railroad
retirement
act
has
indicated
in
clear
and
direct
terms
and
intent
to
supersede
state
law.
the
only
two
sections
of
the
railroad
retirement
act
that
are
relied
on
either
by
the
petitioner
or
by
the
government
in
expressing
that
clear
intent
or
the
anti-assignment
provisions
of
section
231m
and
the
termination
of
the
spousal
benefit
and
the
railroad
retirement
act
itself.
the
anti-assignment
provision
has
been
mentioned
earlier
this
morning.
we
believe
that
that
provision,
borrowed
language
from
spendthrift
trust
ideas
that
was
meant
to
protect
the
worker
against
his
own
failure
to
provide
for
himself.
it
was
to
protect
the
worker
against
the
claims
of
creditors
under
california
law,
the
supreme
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
wife
claiming
as
an
owner
does
not
claim
as
a
creditor
and
that
there
is
no
anticipation
or
assignment
involved
in
awarding
to
her
the
property
that
her
own.
while
it
is
true
that
there
is,
a
federal
question
that
this
court
must
decide
as
to
whether
that
rule
has
been
superseded,
i
don't
believe
anyone
who
suggested
that
there
is
a
different
definition
of
the
legal
terms,
assignment
or
anticipation
for
the
purpose
of
federal
law
and
state
law.
therefore,
in
this
court's
longstanding
practice
of
refusing
to
interfere
with
the
state
domestic
relations
law
and
in
refraining
from
promulgating
a
federal
law
of
domestic
relations,
this
court
ought
to
leave
the
content
of
that
definition
to
state
law.
there
have
been
a
series
of
cases
in
which
the
court
has
looked
at
the
question
of
federal
preemption
of
property
laws.
those
cases
are
cited
in
all
the
briefs
in
this
case
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
the
government
to
say
it's
not
a
preemption
case.
they
rely
very
heavily
on
the
wissner
case.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
yes,
they
rely
in
their
brief
on
the
wissner
case
which
is
a
preemption
case.
the
wissner
case
involved
the
national
service
life
insurance
policy
which
was
a
policy,
a
form
of
property
that
was
created
by
congress
for
the
benefit
of
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
justice
marshall,
the
only
two
provisions
the
railroad
retirement
act
that
they
rely
on
to
say
that
or
the
anti-assignment
provision.
and
the
failure
to
provide
a
benefit
for
divorce
spouses
and
neither
of
those
two
provisions,
we
submit
has
anywhere
near
the
clear
congressional
intent
as
a
language
used
in
the
wissner
case
where
congress
said
this
beneficiary
and
no
other
shall
own
the
proceeds.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
herma
hill
kay
does
what
apply
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
you.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
no,
your
honor.
it
will
apply
only
to
the
eight
community
property
states.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
because
only
in
the
eight
community
property
states
is
the
wife
treated
as
a
co-owner
of
property
as
and
when
it
is
acquired.
and
more
over
it
may
not
apply
in
those
community
property
states
that
have
not
yet
arrived
that
the
position
that
california
has
come
to
in
marriage
of
brown
and
have
not
yet
decided
that
it
will
award
pension
rights
unless
they
are
vested.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
cases
at
this
court
has
decided
earlier,
dealing
with
the
question
of
preemption.
begin
with
the
case
of
wissner
versus
wissner
and
as
i
indicated,
the
court
had
made
very
clear
in
that
case
that
there
was
only
one
beneficiary
of
the
policy
and
the
beneficiary
was
the
person
selected
by
the
serviceman
and
that
beneficiary
and
no
other
would
be
allowed
to
have
the
proceeds
of
the
policy.
there
is
nothing
like
any
such
statement
in
the
railroad
retirement
act,
which
is
before
the
court
today.
in
the
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
your
honor,
the
question
of
how
this
retirement
annuity
is
valued.
i
submit
is
not
before
the
court.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
yes,
well
your
honor
if
(voice
overlap).
ms.
herma
hill
kay
yes.
well,
your
honor
in
california
practice
a
great
amount
of
money,
i
understand
is
spent
on
actuarial
consultants
who
attempt
to
place
a
value
on
this
intangible
property
rights
and
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
you
look
for
example
at
mortality
tables
indicating
how
long
his
likely
to
live.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
right
but
actuaries,
i
understand
are
able
to
take
account
of
factors
of
that
kind
and
at
any
event,
the
california
courts
or
saved
by
the
fact
that
if
the
actuarial
figures
are
not
sufficient
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
make
an
immediate
award,
all
the
court
need
to
do
is
retain
jurisdictions.
so
that
provides
a
very
practical
back
up,
which
the
court
can
fall
back
on.
in
this
case,
the
court
would
only
have
to
wait
until
1981
to
find
out
whether
mr.
hisquierdo
gets
hit
by
a
car
as
he
steps
off
the
curve.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
absolutely,
your
honor
and
that
was
one
of
the
major
arguments
in
marriage
of
brown
against
the
position
that
the
court
took.
and
it
was
because
the
court
felt
that
it
had
to
carry
out
this
strong
state
law
of
policy
of
preserving
the
community
property
interest
as
against
some
more
speculative
alimony
award
that
the
court
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
fall
in
community
property
interest
in
that
case.
so
we
do
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
value
these
kinds
of
things
in
california
but
nevertheless,
the
courts
are
facing
this
problem
as
a
practical
matter
everyday.
now,
in
the
--
the
case
following
wissner
which
also
involved
the
question
of
federal
preemption,
the
case
free
versus
bland,
there
was
again
an
effort
that
to
borrow
money
on
the
federal
credit
and
in
that
case,
this
court
decided
that
the
husband
and
a
community
property
state
buying
co-owner
bonds
with
his
wife
with
the
right
of
survivorship
were
allowed
to
overcome
the
contrary
texas
rule,
which
would
have
said
that
the
spouses
could
not
agree
in
effect
to
convert
what,
was
community
property
into
survivorship
property
that
would
belong
to
the
owner.
the
court
overcame
the
contrary
state
law
interest
in
that
case
because
of
that
necessity
to
raise
money
in
the
public
credit
but
in
the
case
following
free
versus
bland
written
by
mr.
justice
white,
the
yiatchos
against
yiatchos.
the
court
refused
to
permit
that
prior
holding
in
free
against
bland
to
be
used
by
a
husband
in
the
state
of
washington
to
defraud
his
wife
of
her
community
property
interest.
in
that
case,
the
husband
had
invested
something
like
$15,000.00
worth
of
community
funds
as
to
which
he
was
a
sole
manager
in
bonds
naming
his
brother
as
a
survivor.
and
after
his
death,
the
wife
in
effect
said,
my
community
property
rights
have
been
taken
away
by
the
conjunction
of
this
court's
holding
in
free
and
the
husband's
managerial
rights
under
state
law.
and
this
court
said,
we
will
not
allow
the
federal
provisions
here
to
be
used
as
an
instrument
of
fraud
to
take
away
the
wife's
rights.
the
court
used
a
federal
definition
of
fraud
but
in
looking
to
the
content
of
the
wife's
rights,
it's
looked
to
state
law
to
define
her
property
rights.
so
that
it
did
admit
that
even
in
a
case
where
preemption
was
otherwise
clear,
the
wife's
rights
on
the
state
community
property
law
would
be
preserved.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
yes,
your
honor
but
the
court
also
said
that
it
would
seem
obvious
that
the
bonds
may
not
be
used
as
a
device
to
deprive
the
widow
of
property
rights,
which
she
enjoys
under
washington
law
and
which
would
not
be
transferable
by
her
husband
but
for
the
survivorship
provisions
of
the
federal
bonds.
so
the
court
was
willing
to
admit
in
that
case
that
the
strong
federal
interest
which
it
had
found
in
free
against
bland
must
itself
give
way
to
federal
doctrine
filled
with
the
content
of
state
property
law
to
prevent
the
wife
from
being
defrauded
her
rights
by
an
unscrupulous
husband.
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
that
this
court
has
even
in
that
context
that
adhered
to
its
longstanding
practice
of
not
trying
to
write
for
the
country,
a
federal
domestic
relations
law
but
rather
has
conceded
that
state
should
be
followed
to
the
extent
possible
where
not
necessary
to
protect
the
federal
interest.
the
statement
that
was
made
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
your
honor
the
--
in
california,
we
speak
of
community
property
law
as
domestic
relations
law.
a
community
property
exists
only
between
persons
who
are
legally
married
to
each
other
and
in
order
to
have
that
kind
of
property
one
has
to
enter
in
to
a
valid
marriage.
so,
that
in
its
regulation
of
the
rights
between
husband
and
wife
california
has
established
a
community
property
regime.
it
has
also
permitted
alimony
awards
to
be
made
to
either
spouse.
and
indeed,
the
interdependence
of
those
two
factors
is
very
important
because
depending
on
the
amount
of
community
property
awarded,
the
court
may
vary
the
alimony
award
so
that
if
for
example
in
this
case,
the
wife
is
awarded
20%
of
the
railroad
retirement
benefits
as
community
property.
the
court
will
take
that
into
account
in
determining
how
much
spousal
support,
if
any
she
should
get
and
of
course
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that's
not
in
point
since
the
wife
waived
alimony
but
if
you
take
a
different
case
in
which
the
wife
did
not
waive
alimony,
the
court
would
take
those
two
factors
into
account.
and
the
amount
of
community
received
would
go
towards
both
diminishing
her
future
need
for
support
and
in
this
case,
since
it
comes
out
of
the
husband's
railroad
retirement
benefits
his
ability
to
pay.
so,
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
but
it's
confined
to
married
people,
your
honor.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
correct.
i
have
never
contended
anything
before
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
right.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
it's
still
i
submit
has
to
do
with
domestic
relations
law
as
it
relates
the
property
rights
of
persons
who
were
married
to
each
other.
and
it
is
not
i
submit
simply
a
suggestion
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
particular
kind
of
interaction
because
the
whole
sweep
of
california
in
domestic
relations
law
is
based
around
the
idea
of
community
property.
for
example,
i'm
sorry
this
case
isn't
cited
in
my
brief
because
i
didn't
know
that
you're
going
to
make
this
argument
but
the
in
deciding
the
case
of
marvin
versus
marvin
which
has
attracted
a
great
deal
of
publicity.
the
california
supreme
court
expressly
refused
to
apply
community
property
concepts
to
persons
living
in
non-marital
cohabitation.
and
the
court
said,
we'll
enforce
contracts
but
they
are
not
married
and
therefore
community
property
law
does
not
apply.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
a
correct
evaluation
of
the
policy
underlying
state
law.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
and
it
seems
to
me
again
that
therefore
that
the
point
that's
made
throughout
the
brief
of
the
united
states
namely
that
this
court
might
be
willing
to
create
exceptions
if
need
could
be
shown
is
really
totally
irrelevant
to
the
argument
that
we're
making
and
it's
also
i
think
totally
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
congressional
intent
to
preempt
the
fact
that
an
exception
might
be
implied
to
exemption
laws
or
the
spendthrift
laws
and
indeed
even
written
and
now
to
some
of
the
government
benefit
provisions
has
nothing
to
with
this
case
at
all.
ms.
herma
hill
kay
that's
right,
your
honor
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
government
then
throughout
its
brief
at
four
or
five
points
contrast
what
it
refers
to
as
the
mechanical
division
of
property
under
community
property
laws
with
this
need
on
the
theory
i
think
that
it
is
better
to
relegate
the
spouse
to
the
alimony
award
rather
than
to
a
court
or
to
dignity
the
property
right.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
--
ms.
herma
hill
kay
well,
i
hope
upon
reflection
mr.
justice
stewart
you
have
reason
to
read
it
differently
again.
the
--
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
case
does
not
involve
a
far-reaching
principle.
it
does
not
involve
an
effort
to
interfere
with
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
in
the
railroad
retirement
act.
it
merely
simply
refers
to
the
right
of
a
state
court
in
its
domestic
relations
law
to
take
account
of
the
equal
contributions
by
both
spouses
to
the
marriage
and
their
right
to
rely
upon
the
expectation
of
having
that
labor
fulfilled
when
the
marriage
is
dissolved.
thank
you
very
much.
