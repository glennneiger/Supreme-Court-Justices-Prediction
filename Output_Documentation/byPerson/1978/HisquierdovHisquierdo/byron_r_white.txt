so
doesn't
the
--
most
recent
amendment,
not
to
most
recent
amendments
does
forbid
garnishment
to
satisfy
community
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
77
amendments?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
when
the
alimony
--
amount
of
alimony
is
set
--
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
judge,
let's
assume
that
the
man
was
going
to
have
no
income
whatsoever,
except
his
annuity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
$700.00
a
month.
the
court
could
say
while
you're
going
to
be
getting
$700.00
a
month
you
can
afford
to
pay
so
much
for
alimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
to
the
extent
that
you
can
garnish
it
you
could
take
it
into
account.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
statute
also
negatives
the
use
of
it
for
other
purposes.
