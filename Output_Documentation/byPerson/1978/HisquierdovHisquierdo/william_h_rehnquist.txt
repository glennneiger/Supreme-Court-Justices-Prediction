justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
may
it
never
been
of
a
reliance
on
their
part
on
the
proposition
that
the
retirement
benefit
was
community
property
and
therefore
that
the
claim
for
alimony
would
be
less
substantial
or
less
compelling
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
wife?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
endman
you
say
the
question
is
whether
the
california
state
court
can
award
any
part
of
the
retirement
benefit,
would
it
make
any
difference
if
you
rephrase
the
question
to
say
“is
the
california
court
entitled
to
treat
pension
benefits
as
community
property?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
possible
that
there
might
be
a
procedural
impediment
to
the
california
courts
directing
disposition
of
particular
federal
checks
received
by
your
client?
but
did
it
nonetheless
might
be
entitled
to
treat
the
property
which
those
checks
embodied
has
community
property
for
purposes
of
dividing
the
funds
of
the
community
upon
dissolution
of
the
marriage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
a
little
simplistic
in
the
sense
counsel,
certainly
after
that
your
has
deposited
his
check
in
the
bank
that
he
receives
from
the
pension
benefits
and
it
becomes
in
a
general
fund
in
his
bank
account
it
can
be
levied
one,
can
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
alimony.
for
alimony
only?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
no,
can't
his
bank
account
be
garnished
after
the
check
is
clear
and
that
check
is
in
the
bank.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
your
argument
depend
on
equating
a
decree
of
a
divorced
court
with
the
language
garnishment,
attachment
or
other
legal
process
under
435
u.s.c.
231m.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
one
could
demonstrate
that
the
railroad
retirement
act
were
contractual,
would
that
hurt
your
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
had
to
perform
services
for
santa
fe
in
order
to
acquire
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
think
under
your
flemming
against
nestor
analogy
that
congress
after
this
man
had
worked
20
years
for
santa
fe
railroad
and
had
an
accrued
pension
where
i
could
simply
declare
that
he
no
longer
had
such
a
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
money
is
congress
spending
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
is
there
any
indication
of
the
santa
fe
can't
meet
the
burden
of
its
pensions
that
it's
going
to
have
to
call
on
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
pension
checks
actually
come
from
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
say
this
court
spoke
of
force
and
clarity
in
wissner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
stillman,
perhaps
you
can
answer
the
question
that
your
co-counsel
and
i
are
uncertain
about
and
that
is,
do
these
pension
payments
come
in
a
form
of
a
government
check
and
if
so
is
the
government
paying
out
money
that
was
previously
paid
to
it
by
santa
fe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
employee
tier
ii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
general
scheme
of
the
act
to
make
it
self-financing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
to
protect
these
funds
for
the
worker,
do
you
think
congress
really
meant
to
cut
that
deep
into
the
social
policy
of
the
states
and
if
the
state
policy
was
to
say
that,
if
the
worker
and
was
married
there
was
a
marital
community
to
exclude
the
wife
from
the
benefit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
a
divorce
decree
is
legal
process
for
that
to
go
through?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
is
that
by
in
terms
applied
to
railroad
retirement
benefits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
659
or
just
referred
to
garnishment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
mean
that
section
you
immediately
just
cite
but
659
which
is,
i
understand
that
the
75
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
then
it
isn't
an
entirely
accurate
to
say
that
the
75
act
by
its
terms
applies
to
the
treatment
of
community
property,
is
it
in
railroad
retirement
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
still
talking
it
about
it
under
the
umbrella
of
alimony
or
rather
of
garnishment,
are
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
the
award
of
community
property
is
not
garnishment
then
that
statute
i
take
it
would
not
apply?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
different
argument,
isn't
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
redundancy
if
there
is
one
is
really
between
the
prohibition
against
anticipation
and
the
statutory
requirement
for
benefits,
service
time
and
so
forth
rather
than
the
statutory
prohibition
against
anticipation
and
the
statutory
prohibition
against
garnishment,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
we
believe
so.
as
is
brought
out
in
the
respondent's
briefs
and
then
in
the
two
amici
briefs
filed
on
her
behalf
that
this
court
does
not
under
established
law
pursuant
intent
where
no
intent
to
exist.
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
thoroughly
discussed
in
the
briefs
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
a
state
community
property
law.
the
existence
of
the
spouse's
benefits
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
does
not
imply
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
state
community
property
law
that
the
mere
existence
of
that
spouse's
benefit
is
an
interesting
question
in
itself.
we
believe
that
it
was
enacted
in
1951
in
response
to
the
demands
of
the
railroaders
who
had
traditionally
been
receiving
an
amount
of
benefits
for
an
excess
of
social
security.
by
1950,
however,
congress
had
amended
the
social
security
act
so
that
there
was
an
average
benefit
increase
of
77%.
at
this
point,
the
railroaders
who
were
receiving
less
than
the
social
security
recipients
in
the
railroads
themselves
which
were
upset
that
they
were
contributing
greater
amounts
of
money
into
the
railroad
retirement
fund
than
social
security
recipient
employers
would
be
contributing,
that
greater
benefits
were
in
order.
we
believe
that
the
existence
of
the
spouses
benefit
was
merely
to
an
explanation
for
congress'
intent
to
provide
greater
benefits
in
order
to
make
the
railroad
retirement
recipients
receiving
more
than
the
social
security
recipients.
the
fact
that
the
spouses
benefit
terminates
upon
divorce,
merely
supplements
at
section
231
(d)
because
at
the
conclusion
of
the
marriage
there
is
no
spouse.
the
spouse
receives
a
separate
benefit,
separate
and
apart
from
her
husband.
she
receives
a
separate
check.
this
could
be
a
good
explanation
for
why
the
court
--
why
the
congress
determined
that
the
spouse's
benefit
terminates
upon
divorce.
congress
did
not
determine
that
the
spouse
is
not
--
is
precluded
under
the
supremacy
clause
from
establishing
any
community
property
interest
in
husbands,
right
to
receive
the
federal
railroad
retirement
benefits.
to
conclude
that
congress
by
enacting
house
bill
8771
in
which
was
signed
by
president
carter
on
september
15th
and
enacted
as
public
law
95-366
recognizes
that
congress
can
in
effect
affirm
the
california
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case
is
merely
in
support
of
respondent's
argument
that
what
california
is
doing
does
not
conflict
congressional
intent.
8771
was
enacted
in
order
--
in
recognition
of
--
by
congress
of
the
greater
needs
that
are
present
in
today's
society
by
older
divorced
women.
congress
is
receptive
to
this
point
of
older
divorced
women
and
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
alimony
awards
are
also
a
taxable,
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
alimony
awards
generally
taxable
to
the
recipient?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
true,
mrs.
kay
that
california
for
a
long
time
has
treated
insurance
and
nobody
is
paid
by
private
insurance
companies
as
community
property
rather
than
the
alimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
the
california
courts
face
similar
problems,
and
value,
and
purely
private
pension
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
community
property
really
depends
upon
the
concept
of
the
contribution
of
each
of
the
partner
to
the
marriage
where
its
alimony
depends
on
the
need
of
the
partners
after
the
marriage
is
dissolved.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why,
suppose
the
california
courts
would
say
that
if
he'd
worked
on
a
railroad
for
40
years
and
had
a
pension
and
she'd
worked
at
home
raising
kids
and
keeping
house
for
40
years,
that
if
he
simply
walks
off
with
the
major
asset
that's
accrued
from
his
income
during
that
time.
and
that
is
a
form
of
fraud.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
(voice
overlap)
whether
it's
separate
property
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
here
the
state
has
said
it
is
not
separate
property.
