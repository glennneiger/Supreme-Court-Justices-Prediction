justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
long
does
this
exemption
last.
he
gets
a
check
from
retirement
board
1936
and
he
put
it
in
the
bank,
how
long
does
it
last?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
will
last
a
lifetime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
will
last
his
lifetime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
it
would
be
mutual
fund?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
an
investment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
good
or
bad?
can
you
get
to
him
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
different
between
a
mutual
fund
and
the
bank
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
was
the
community
property
singled
out,
is
there
any
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
was
community
property
singled
out
for
special
treatment
in
the
last
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
other
reason
in
the
history?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
do
a
community
--
when
you
separate
community
property,
you're
dealing
with
need
too,
aren't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
case,
this
woman
needs
some
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
doesn't
she?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mrs.
stillman,
i
don't
think
the
need
anything
else
is
involved
in
this.
i
think
the
same
statute
applies
to
a
movie
actor
as
it
applies
to
a
laborer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
you
read
the
statute
that
will
allow
us
to
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
read
the
statute
that
says
you
just
can't
do
this?
to
say
yes
you
may
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
what
i'm
waiting
for
you
to
explain
it
and
why
didn't
you
just
say
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
do
you
think
anticipation
means?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
the
statute
is
not
a
word
of
art.
the
statute
says,
“you
can't
collect.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
was
the
statute
amended
in
75?
justice
thurgood
marshall
surplusage.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
about
the
77?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
didn't
waive
without
the
community
property,
it
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
have
but
it
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
recognize
that
it
did
prohibit
it,
didn't
you?
you
now
recognize
that
it
does
prohibit
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
my
question
was
that,
it
didn't
take
our
community
property
so
they
lifted
in
and
you
must
take
and
they
say
that's
right.
we
really
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
they
said
no
legal
proceeding.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
certain
exceptions
like
divorce.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
divorce
is
not
legal
proceeding,
why
do
you
lawyers
charge
fees?
let
me
take
a
simple
way
of
looking
at
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
government
says
this
is
not
a
preemption
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
heard
the
government's
standing
is
moot,
standing
right
where
you
are?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
i
understand
the
government
position
be
that
there's
a
specific
statute
that
doesn't
say
preemption
or
anything
else?
it
merely
says
that
this
money
that
it
comes
from
the
retirement
board
shall
not
be
used
with
this
purpose.
well,
that's
not
preemption
anyway,
not
just
a
prohibition.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
does
this
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
provision
apply
to
all
of
the
class
sections
all
over
the
country?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
limit
it
to
community
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
the
decision
in
this
case
apply
to
all
50
states
of
america?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
apply
to
maximum
of
eight
with
no
certainty
and
not
all
eight?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
we
met
this
in
court,
the
survivorship
provision
as
a
federal
law
which
must
prevail
if
it
conflicts
with
state
law?
