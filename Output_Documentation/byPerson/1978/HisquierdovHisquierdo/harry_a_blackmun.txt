justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
as
mr.
rehnquist
point
that
granted
everything
you
say
does
that
necessarily
mean
you
win
your
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
this
is
the
next
step,
it
is
taken
into
consideration
and
maybe
making
your
client
just
go
with
something
else
wholly
apart
from
the
inability
to
touch
the
benefit
fund.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
all
i'm
suggesting
that
might
that
i
think
this
is
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
had
in
mind
and
i
don't
believe
you've
answered
it
is
that
all
it's
doing
in
adding
up
assets
is
destroying
the
benefit
from
into
the
computation
without
touching
it
but
drawing
on
some
other
assets
in
determining
the
appropriate
share
of
the
community.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
say
they
can't
do
this.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
this
case
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california.
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
are
california
residents.
they
were
husband
and
wife.
california
is
one
of
the
seven
states
that
has
a
community
property
law
which
came
down
to
us
from
spanish.
in
california,
the
rule
of
law
rest
upon
the
theory
that
in
respect
to
property
acquired
during
marriage,
the
marriage
is
a
community
of
which
each
spouse
is
a
member
who
contributes
equally
to
the
prosperity
of
the
marriage.
community
property
includes
that
which
is
earned
by
either
spouse
during
the
union.
in
1975,
mr.
hisquierdo,
the
petitioner,
instituted
this
proceeding
in
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county
for
dissolution
of
the
marriage.
he
was
a
railroad
machinist
and
at
the
time
the
divorce
suit
was
filed
he
was
55
years
of
age.
he
had
worked
for
the
santa
fe
and
later
the
los
angeles
union
passenger
terminal
for
32
years.
his
work
was
covered
by
the
railroad
retirement
act
of
1974
and
if
and
when
he
attains
age
60,
he
will
receive
benefits
under
the
act.
his
wife
was
employed
separately.
each
of
them
waived
any
claim
for
alimony.
the
pertinent
issue
in
the
litigation
is
whether
that
portion
of
the
anticipated
benefits
under
the
railroad
retirement
act
attributable
to
petitioner's
work
during
the
period
of
the
marriage
qualifies
as
community
property
and
is
to
be
divided
between
the
parties
either
as
received
or
by
way
of
calculation
into
the
present
division
of
their
other
community
property.
the
benefits
under
the
act
are
not
contractual.
they
can
be
altered
by
congress
at
any
time.
the
act
provides
benefits
for
an
employee's
spouse
but
those
benefits
terminate
upon
an
absolute
divorce
except
for
satisfying
child
support
or
alimony
obligations.
the
act
in
section
231m
specifically
provides
and
i
quote,
“no
annuity
under
the
act
shall
be
assignable
or
be
subject
to
any
tax
or
to
garnishment,
attachment,
or
other
legal
process
under
any
circumstances
whatsoever.
nor
shall
the
payment
thereof
be
anticipated.”
that's
the
end
of
the
quote.
the
trial
court
ruled
that
the
wife
had
no
interest
in
the
petitioner's
expectation
of
benefits
under
this
act.
the
supreme
court
of
california
reversed
that
holding
and
held
that
the
benefits
were
community
property.
it
cast
aside
the
apparent
barrier
of
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
that
provisions
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
creditors.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
benefits
payable
under
the
act
may
not
be
divided
under
the
state's
community
property
law
to
require
the
employee
to
pay
respondent
a
portion
of
the
anticipated
benefits
or
its
monetary
equivalent
would
contravene
the
statute
and
deprive
the
employee
of
a
portion
of
a
benefit
that
congress
indicated
was
designed
for
the
employee
alone.
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution,
the
state
must
defer
to
the
act's
statutory
scheme
for
allocating
benefits
insofar
as
the
terms
of
federal
law
require.
i'm
authorized
to
state
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
