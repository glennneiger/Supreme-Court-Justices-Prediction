mr.
james
d.
endman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
within
matter
was
commenced
on
january
9,
1975
when
the
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
the
dissolution
of
his
marriage.
this
is
equivalent
to
a
divorce
in
other
states.
the
facts
the
stated
in
his
petition
indicated
that
the
parties
were
married
in
september
1958
and
separated
in
july
1972.
prior
to
his
marriage
the
petitioner
was
working
for
the
atchison,
topeka
&
santa
fe
railroad
and
had
been
so
employed
since
june
1942.
in
april
1975,
he
changes
his
employment
to
the
los
angeles
union
passenger
terminal.
with
over
30
years
of
railroad
connected
employment,
the
petitioner
will
be
eligible
for
his
retirement
benefits
when
he
reaches
age
60
he
is
presently
57
years
of
age.
the
trial
court
was
called
upon
to
consider
whether
the
future
benefits
are
community
property.
it
was
the
trial
courts
determination
that
there
is
no
community
interest
in
petitioner's
railroad
retirement
fund.
the
wife
filed
an
appeal
to
the
california
district
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
of
appeal
affirmed
basing
their
opinion
on
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
preemption
of
this
field
by
congress.
mr.
james
d.
endman
the
rules
of
law
of
property
division
and
the
rules
relating
to
spouses
support
as
we
call
it
which
is
equivalent
to
alimony
or
completely
different
alimony
are
spouses
support
will
be
based
solely
on
the
needs
and
ability
of
the
parties.
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
think
then
that
under
42
u.s.c.
659
i
think,
or
28
u.s.c.
659
that
that
could
be
executed
upon
the
railroad
retirement
funds
in
order
to
enforce
payment.
mr.
james
d.
endman
well,
i
think
the
federal
statute
specifically
allows
the
immunity
of
the
exemption
clause
not
to
apply
to
the
spouses
support
and
child
support
provisions.
so
if
california
made
a
provision
for
spouses
support
and
of
course
they
could
execute
upon
the
railroad
retirement
fund
as
well
as
any
other
property.
mr.
james
d.
endman
well,
as
a
practical
matter
both
parties
waive
spouses
support
at
the
initiation
of
the
proceeding
in
the
trials
courts.
mr.
james
d.
endman
no,
this
issue
the
spouse
waived
her
right
to
spouses
support
and
what
their
reason
for
ms.
hisquierdo's
attorney,
i
don't
know
but
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
that
was
their
presumed
intent
i
don't
know
what
went
on
in
their
mind,
i
think
what
they
attempted
to
do
was
to
try
and
get
the
house
free
and
clear
of
any
other
obligations.
mr.
james
d.
endman
as
i
recall
there
is
no
attempt
ever
for,
to
obtain
pro-rata
payment.
the
sole
attempt
by
the
spouses'
attorney's
and
they
never
put
any
evidence
to
this
effect
although
they
indicated
in
a
trial
brief
that
they
intended
to
find
the
present
actuarial
value
of
the
railroad
retirement
benefits
and
offset
that
against
the
house
which,
was
ultimately
awarded
to
the
husband
in
this
case
and
out
of
that
house
he
is
making
payments
to
equalized
the
division.
but
to
my
recollection
there
were
no
real
attempt
on
their
part
to
seek
a
pro-rata
share.
the
district
court
of
appeals
having
affirmed
the
lower
court
the
petitioner
or
the
respondent
in
this
matter
they're
upon
petition
the
california
supreme
court
for
hearing.
hearing
thereon
was
granted
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
they
reversed
this
matter
holding
an
effect
that
the
field
had
not
been
preempted
and
petitioner's
entitlement
to
railroad
retirement
fund
benefits
could
be
subjected
to
the
california
community
property
laws.
following
that
opinion
petitioner
herein
filed
to
this
court
for
writ
of
certiorari
pursuing
to
28
u.s.c.
1257
(3)
contesting
the
validity
of
the
california
community
property
laws
requiring
equal
division
of
community
property
and
the
federal
retirement
act.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
in
a
divorce
proceeding
the
trial
court
can
award
any
portion
of
the
railroad
connected
employees
future
entitlement
to
benefits
to
anyone
other
than
the
employee.
we
are
really
concerned
with
three
inquiries
in
deciding
the
issue
of
preemption.
first,
does
the
act
of
congress
touch
a
field
in
which
the
federal
interest
is
so
dominant
at
the
federal
system
will
be
assumed
to
preclude
enforcement
of
state
laws?
two,
has
congress
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
declared
that
the
state
community
property
laws
are
prohibited
from
regulating
in
this
area?
and
three
and
even
if
congress
has
not
completely
foreclose
the
state
legislation
is
the
state
statute
void
because
they
actually
conflict
with
a
valid
federal
act?
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
think
partly
true
and
partly
incorrect.
i
think
the
--
which
ever
way
california
treats
it,
whether
it's
community
property
or
separate
property
the
exemption
statute
makes
it
clear
that
they
can't
touch
at
all.
i'll
get
into
this
in
a
short
while
but
they
can't
touch
the
railroad
retirement
benefit
so
whichever
way
california
analogizes
it
whether
community
or
not.
it's
the
areas
been
preempted
by
congress.
mr.
james
d.
endman
well,
i
think
the
exemption
statute
states
that
the
railroad
retirement
benefits
are
not
subject
to
any
legal
process
and
i
submit
that
a
divorce
proceeding
is
a
legal
process.
the
exemption
statute
provides
that
they
are
not
subject
to
and
anticipation
and
if
the
court
in
a
divorce
proceeding
provides
that
in
the
future
he's
going
to
get
some
benefits
and
based
on
those
future
entitlement
to
benefits,
we
are
going
to
say
that
the
other
spouse
is
entitled
to
something
right
now
or
some
outside
moneys
then
they're
anticipating
this
future
entitlement
and
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
think
if
the
trial
court
is
prevented
from
taking
into
consideration
the
issue
of
railroad
retirement
fund.
mr.
james
d.
endman
well,
i
think
this
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
prohibition
against
illegal
process,
any
legal
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
california
courts
to
deal
with
the
railroad
retirement
fund.
mr.
james
d.
endman
well
that
that
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
say
they
can't
do
this
because
that
would
amount
to
anticipation
that
there
will
be
a
receipt
of
these
benefits.
mr.
james
d.
endman
exactly.
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
believe
that
there
are
cases
dealing
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
well
for
alimony,
well
i
don't
contend
that
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
believe
there
is
an
exemption
would
apply
to
any
creditors
and
would
continue
as
long
as
it's
in
the
bank
now.
there
are
cases
cited
by
the
respondent
which
indicate
in
their
briefs
that
the
exemption
extends
with
regard
to
social
security
benefits
even
after
the
receipt
of
those
benefits.
and
even
after
they're
placed
in
a
bank
account,
even
after
they're
placed
in
a
savings
and
loan
account
at
least
up
until
such
time
as
they
are
invested
in
some
type
of
an
investment
other
than
just
being
readily
available
for
his
necessities
and
needs
in
life.
now
i
think
this
would
apply
to
any
creditors
including
the
spouse
other
than
the
spouse's
rights
to
spouses
support
or
alimony
as
most
states
call
it
or
a
child
support.
mr.
james
d.
endman
yes
with
the
other
legal
process
portion
of
it
rather
than
the
garnishment
or
attachment.
mr.
james
d.
endman
the
prior
to
leaving
los
angeles
at
least
to
supplement
to
our
code
books
indicated
that
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
well,
i
assumed
that
would
have
been
in
the
78
supplement
net
still
as
contain
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
indicated
that
garnishment,
attachment
or
other
legal
process
or
nor
shall
any
attempt
to
be
made
to
anticipate
those
program.
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
think
under
the
cases
as
i
indicated
as
cited
by
the
respondents
that
exemption
would
last
so
long
as
it
is
in
a
bank
available
for
his
needs
while
he's
alive
apparently
even
to
the
extent
of
where
he
is
buried.
mr.
james
d.
endman
pardon?
mr.
james
d.
endman
it
could
last
his
lifetime
as
long
as
there
are
left
in
a
bank
or
savings
in
a
long
type
investment
where
it's
immediately
available
to
him.
mr.
james
d.
endman
well,
i
think
the
protection
would
disappear
when
the
moneys
were
place
into
an
investment.
now
that
might,
i
would
think
when
he
bought
the
first
real
estate
that
he
was
not
living
yet.
mr.
james
d.
endman
a
mutual
fund.
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
would
consider
that
an
investment.
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
think
that
could
be
gotten
to
a
mutual
fund
investment
since
it's
no
longer
immediately
available
for
his
needs.
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
think
in
the
bank
you
can
go
that
day
to
the
bank
to
get
some
money
for
food
or
groceries
what
have
you
and
a
mutual
fund
is
a
little
more
difficult
requiring
some
clearance.
mr.
james
d.
endman
no,
that's,
no
as
i
say
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
it's
who
owns
the
benefit
at
this
point
and
whether
the
court
can
anticipate
him
receiving
the
benefit
as
i
pointed
out
in
this
case
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
right,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
under
each
of
these
inquiries
the
state
law
will
be
an
obstacle
to
the
preemption
of
the
railroad
retirement
act.
first
of
all
the
railroad
retirement
act
is
in
a
field
in
which
the
federal
interest
is
so
dominant
that
the
federal
system
will
be
assumed
to
preclude
enforcement
of
state
laws
on
the
same
subject.
we
are
actually
here
not
dealing
with
any
property
right,
what
we
have
is
a
social
insurance
benefit
to
the
same
extent
to
the
social
security
as
was
stated
in
the
case
of
flemming
versus
nestor.
the
property
right
arises
with
respect
to
pension
plans
by
reason
of
a
chosen
action
to
it
the
fact
that
an
employee
works
for
a
company
and
it
is
part
or
an
element
of
this
compensation.
i
realized
that
this
court
has
stated
in
the
case
of
herb
versus
pitcairn
at
this
court's
power
over
state
judgments
is
to
correct
them
only
to
the
extent
that
they
incorrectly
adjudge
federal
rights.
i
submit
that
this
is
just
the
case
that
california
has
adjudged
these
non-contractual
rights
to
be
contractual
rights.
social
security
benefits
and
railroad
retirement
act
benefits
are
essentially
a
part
of
the
same
social
insurance
scheme.
both
systems
are
finance
by
a
tax
levied
upon
the
payrolls
of
the
employees
and
their
employers.
the
proceeds
therefrom
are
paid
into
the
united
states
treasury.
each
year
an
amount
equal
to
the
benefits
and
administrative
expenses
are
appropriated
to
a
trust
fund.
furthermore,
the
social
security
act
is
closely
coordinated
with
the
railroad
retirement
act.
credits
to
the
social
security
system
may
be
transferred
from
railroad
service.
automatic
adjustments
are
made
to
the
railroad
retirement
system
whenever
the
social
security
act
is
amended.
adjust
for
benefits
under
the
railroad
retirement
act
are
made
whenever
the
employee
is
eligible
for
benefits
under
the
social
security
act.
mr.
james
d.
endman
in
this
aspect
yes,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
demonstrated
because
using
these
facts
as
an
example.
mr.
hisquierdo
works
for
santa
fe,
he
works
for
the
l.a.
passenger
terminal,
and
he
does
not
work
for
the
united
states
government.
there
was
no
contract
between
him
and
the
united
state
to
these
benefits.
mr.
james
d.
endman
he
performed
services
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
the
social
insurance
benefit
that's
a
foundation
for
the
satisfaction
or
the
eligibility
requirements.
just
as
in
social
security
there
has
to
be
40
quarters
of
work
in
order
to
qualify
for
social
security
yet
this
court
has
said
in
flemming
versus
nestor
that
there
are
not
contractual
rights
thereto
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
statutory
right
with
no
contractual
elements
involved.
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
don't
think
they
can
do
that
without
running
into
some
problems
with
the
due
process
clause
but
--
and
probably
some
other
political
ramifications.
i
submit
that
both
of
social
security
act
and
the
railroad
retirement
act
are
part
of
the
same
social
insurance
scheme.
both
are
enacted
pursuant
to
the
power
to
spend
money
in
aid
of
the
general
welfare.
this
power
i
submit
is
strictly
a
federal
matter
and
should
be
govern
by
federal
law
without
interference
by
the
states.
mr.
james
d.
endman
congress,
if
the
income
is
sufficient
--
insufficient
will
by
appropriations
have
to
make
funds
and
this
of
course
one
of
the
problems
that
in
reading
the
newspapers
that
the
social
security
is
running
into
is
that,
they're
constantly
raising
the
taxes
to
the
point
to
some
support
these
funds.
mr.
james
d.
endman
well
this
is
not
a
santa
fe
pension.
what
we're
dealing
with
is
the
u.s.
government
pension
whether
the
question
is
whether
the
government
will
call
upon
santa
fe?
mr.
james
d.
endman
yes,
i
believe
that's
the
way
it
is.
i
can
only
say
i
believe
so
because
my
client
is
not
retired
and
i
have
no
idea
where
the
pension
will
eventually
come
from
but
i
believe
it
will
be
from
the
railroad
retirement
board
itself.
since
i
wish
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
i
just
want
to
indicate
that
the
scheme
of
the
railroad
retirement
act
is
full
and
complete.
that
if
we
look
at
section
231
(a)
subparagraphs
(a)
and
(b),
it
is
clear
that
the
railroad
retirement
entitlements
to
an
annuity
are
to
the
individual
under
that
section.
if
we
look
at
subparagraph
(c),
we
see
that
the
spouse
of
the
individual
is
covered
by
the
spouse's
annuity.
and
if
we
look
under
subparagraph
(d),
we
find
that
survivors,
widows,
widowers,
children
and
parents
also
receive
benefits.
congress
was
explicit
under
231
(d)
subparagraph
(c)
(3)
(b)
that
entitlement
of
the
spouse
of
an
individual
to
an
annuity
under
231
(a)
subparagraph
(c)
shall
end
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
preceding
a
judgment
of
absolute
divorce.
this
court
dealing
with
national
service
life
insurance
has
spoken
with
the
force
and
clarity
that
in
directing
the
proceeds
to
belong
to
named
beneficiary
under
the
life
insurance
that
the
states
have
no
power
to
deal
with
those
that
the
areas
have
been
preempted.
mr.
james
d.
endman
well
even
though
it
was
divided
opinion,
the
opinion
itself
says
that
they
have
spoken
with
force
in
congress
--
congress
has
spoken
excuse
me,
i
apologized.
i
submit
that
under
the
railroad
retirement
act,
congress
has
spoken
with
equal
force
and
clarity
that
the
annuity
it
belongs
to
the
individual
and
no
other,
at
the
spouse's
annuity
belongs
to
the
spouse
and
no
other
and
because
the
spouse
will
lose
the
spouse's
annuity
by
reason
of
a
judgment
of
absolute
divorce
does
not
give
that
spouse
the
right
to
claim
a
portion
of
the
individuals
annuity.
that
annuity's
scheme
is
full,
it
is
complete,
it
was
made
to
it's
exclusive
as
state
of
interference
and
that
state
interference
is
excluded
by
a
reason
of
section
231m
which,
we've
already
talked
about.
i
submit
the
congress
has
considered
the
possibility
of
termination
of
marriage
by
reason
the
section
231m
that
they
made
provision
as
they
saw
fit.
that
neither
this
court
nor
california
has
any
place
second
guessing
the
wisdom
of
congress
if
the
spouse
suffers
a
hardship
as
a
result.
it
is
most
unfortunate
but
it
for
congress
to
correct.
mr.
james
d.
endman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court,
i
would
again
like
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
in
offset
of
other
community
property
will
be
just
as
damaging
to
the
annuitant
as
taking
of
other
part
of
the
exact
annuity.
i'd
also
like
to
clarify
one
point
that
even
though
we
use
the
word
“annuity”
here
we
are
not
talking
of
it
the
same
as
life
insurance
type
annuity.
we
are
talking
of
congressional
act
similar
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
no,
i
believe
it's
more
than
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
d.
endman
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
identical
to
social
security
that
those
who
are
presently
working
are
paying
a
tax
under
the
railroad
retirement
tax
act
that
goes
into
the
government
and
then
is
appropriated
to
take
care
of
those
who
are
presently
retired.
there
is
no
purchase
situation
involved
here
as
we
would
have
in
a
life
insurance
contract
situation
that
there
is
no
contract
involved
here.
it
is
merely
a
welfare
type
program
providing
that
those
who
work
are
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
his
right
should
he
die
prematurely
would
extend
only
to
a
code
section
that
provides
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
well,
under
the
--
yes,
he
would
the
right
to
enforce
that
under
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
james
d.
endman
yes,
that's
what
we
are
referring
to
as
this
court
stated
in
the
flemming
case
i
submit
is
the
exact
same
situation
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
railroad
retirement
that
they
are
part
of
that
same
exact
scheme.
mr.
james
d.
endman
yes.
the
congress
with
regard
to
section
231m
if
they
intended
to
limit
the
assignment
provisions
only
to
creditors
could've
provided
as
they
did
in
national
service
life
insurance
that
only
creditors
shall
be
prohibited
from
garnishment,
attachment,
etcetera.
but
they
didn't
put
that
word
in
and
intended
to
be
much
broader.
we
simply
“we
submit”
that
there's
a
conflict
between
the
federal
law
and
a
community
property
laws
that
it's
a
physical
and
possibility
within
this
scheme
to
give
part
of
the
proceeds
to
the
annuitant
under
the
code
and
then
take
away
part
of
it.
it's
impossible
to
give
him
his
entire
statutory
due.
i
would
like
to
also
indicate
that
it's
my
understanding
that
even
though
railroad
retirement
will
apply
to
the
eight
community
property
states
i
understand
that
there
are
other
states
that
have
equal
division
requirements
as
an
example.
i
believe
illinois
contacted
by
an
attorney
is
just
passed
such
a
statute.
so,
this
statute
will
extend
beyond
just
a
community
property
states.
i
think
the
effect
of
this
statute
will
also
apply
not
only
to
railroad
retirement
but
because
social
security
is
the
same
scheme
as
goes
railroad
retirement
so
probably
social
security
and
there
are
some
cases
i
understand
pending
regarding
pension
plans
under
the
risk
of
program
whether
they
also
too
would
be
involved.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
under
the
yiatchos
case
referred
to
by
the
amicus
for
now.
in
that
case,
it
involved
the
ability
of
the
husband
in
that
case
to
take
community
funds
put
them
into
savings
bonds
and
thus
defraud
his
wife.
the
railroad
retiree
does
not
have
that
ability
to
move
around
to
his
annuity
funds
or
there
can
be
no
frauds
involved
unless
we're
to
say
that
by
taking
a
railroad
job
he's
trying
to
deprive
his
wife
in
that
railroad
annuity.
unless,
i
don't
think
that
that
yiatchos
case
applies
to
this
situation.
mr.
james
d.
endman
i
don't
see
that
as
being
a
fraud.
that's
an
accumulation
of
a
property
right
and
if
it's
separate
property
for
instance
a
case
i
recently
had
was
involved
the
man
who
would
inherited
property
which
was
a
substantial
portion
of
what
these
people
had.
he
had
worked
on
that
properties
that
he
had
inherited
and
under
california
law,
that's
separate
property
and
the
fact
that
he
was
worth
probably
a
millionaire
at
least
he
admitted
to
being
a
millionaire
--
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
she
got
no
part
of
it
but
it
could
be
taken
into.
mr.
james
d.
endman
well,
that
would
be
up
to
the
state
to
decide
--
mr.
james
d.
endman
right,
the
state
has
said
it's
a
community
property
but
we
submit
is
because
of
the
conflict
involved
that
even
if
it
is
community
property
the
state
has
no
right
to
touch
it.
any
further
questions?
thank
you,
your
honor.
