chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
77-533
in
hisquierdo
against
hisquierdo,
if
that's
right.
mr.
endman
you
may
proceed,
i
think.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
california
law
setting
aside
the
community
property
division,
could
the
divorce
court
after
dividing
the
properties
say,
i'm
going
to
give
“x”
dollars
of
alimony
which
will
be
paid
out
of
the
retirements
fund
when
it
becomes
payable,
now
the
origin
be
deferred
presumably
three
years
on
your
figures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
assuming
he
found
the
need
and
the
ability
is
the
fund.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
notwithstanding
any
federal
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
practical
matter
if
you
care
to,
would
you
suggest
why
that
wasn't
the
solution
to
these
problems
instead
of
having
it
go
all
the
route
up
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
they
wanted
to
have
a
lawsuit
to
decide
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
want
to
get
this
--
they
want
to
get
more
money
in
the
specific
way
they
don't
want
it
by
the
alimony
route,
was
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
they
can't
do
indirectly
what
their
prohibited
by
statute
from
doing
directly
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
benefit
of
the
protection
would
disappear
if
he
bought
some
real
estate
and
sold
it
to
the
profit
and
bought
some
more
real
estate.
at
what
point
does
the
protection
disappear,
the
immunity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
stillman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
the
value
of
this,
the
annuity
value
of
this
as
so
of
the
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
you
think
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
kind
of
annuity
would
cause
a
very
large
sum
of
money.
what
will
his
payments
be
just
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what's
the
amount
that
he's
going
to
receive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
per
months?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
outside
the
record
for
the
moment
since
it's
only
hypothetical,
tell
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
cost
to
for
a
man
at
the
age
of
60,
close
to
a
$100,000.00
to
buy
that
as
a
single
premium
annuity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
say
this,
the
courts
of
california
may
not
even
take
it
into
account
when
they
divide
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
friend
whose
argue
--
whose
supporting
--
whose
argument
your
supporting
has
said
that
they
could
of
have
done
this
by
way
alimony.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fields.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
railroad
retirement
act,
what
happens
if
this
man
dies
before
he
reaches
age
60?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
happens
to
the
money?
we
know
they
are
divorced.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
forfeited?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
treated
to
the
fund,
in
other
words.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
had
remained
marriage
she
would
have
received
part
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
it's
a
joint
and
survivorship
annuity
in
effect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
generally
speaking,
california's,
that
domestic
relations
law
on
how
its
administered
is
none
of
our
business
but
tell
me
whether
the
california
courts
still
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
alimony
in
this
case
or
to
re-examine
this
case
depending
on
the
outcome
--
to
re-examine
the
case
in
california,
depending
on
the
outcome
of
this
appeal
in
this
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
possibly
also
be
speculative
since
mrs.
stillman
said
that
if
he
died
before
reaching
age
60
that
whole
fund
is
wiped
out,
that
is
there
is
no
fund,
there
is
no
asset
anymore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock
counsels.
has
your
friend,
is
mr.
fields
completed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mrs.
kay
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view,
if
the
judge
simply
said
perhaps
to
himself
first,
“i'm
going
to
take
into
account
that
there
is
about
a
$100,000.00
asset
here,
contingent
upon
the
man's
surviving.
take
it
into
account,
not
anticipate
it
in
the
sense
that
word
is
used
as
a
word
of
art.
would
you
think
he
could
properly
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
then
what
if
the
gentleman
died
either
a
week
before
or
a
year
after?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
after
they
had
vested,
after
it
vested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
continuing
jurisdiction
of
the
domestic
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
there
again
is
a
practical
matter
and
it's
beyond
our
jurisdiction.
it's
a
matter
for
california.
as
a
practical
matter,
certainly
the
judge
would
not
be
unaware
and
if
he
was,
some
of
the
counsel
would
make
him
aware
the
fact
that
this
was
a
highly
speculated
asset.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
would
hardly
ascribed
any
fixed
value
to
it
but
does
that
not
also
suggest
and
again,
this
is
not
our
business
that
the
railroad
retirement
pension
or
any
other
similar
pension
is
a
subject
for
due
to
be
dealt
with
under
alimony
not
under
community
property.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
speculative
about
the
value
of
a
life
insurance
policy
is
there?
that
is
it
has
cash
value
on
any
given
day
and
upon
death
while
the
policy
is
still
enforced,
it
has
a
face
value
measurable
but
how?
if
--
would
you
advise
a
judge
to
place
a
value
on
this
retirement
annuity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
know
it
isn't
but
there
are
some
practical
aspects
to
this
case
which
we've
all
been
exploring
and
they
are
very
importance
to
the
element
resolution
to
the
problem
perhaps.
so
how
would
you
tell
the
judge
if
he
said
now,
will
you
counsel,
tell
us
how
to
value
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
use
survivorship
rights
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
do
you
do
that
on
annuity
which
will
terminate
on
the
incident
of
the
death
of
this
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
what
if
he
steps
off
of
the
curve
and
gets
hit
by
a
truck
and
mortality
table
isn't
going
to
help
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
kay.
you
have
a
few
minutes
left
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
because
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
life
insurance
annuity
and
it
does
apply
here,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
mean
that
a
recipient,
the
railroad
retiree
doesn't
have
a
contractual
right
to
recover
the
payments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
talking
about
during
his
lifetime.
suppose,
they
didn't
pay
it,
he
could
force
the
payment,
could
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-533,
hisquierdo
against
hisquierdo
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
