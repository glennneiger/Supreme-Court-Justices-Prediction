mr.
howard
m.
fields
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
simply
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
stated
whether
the
california
courts,
in
applying
california
family
law
doctrines
relating
to
community
property
may
include
in
a
total
amount
of
assets
acquired
during
the
marriage
but
prior
to
separation,
the
present
value
of
the
petitioners
railroad
retirement
benefits
to
the
extent
that
they
are
attributable
to
employment
during
the
marriage.
the
issue
was
not
one
of
a
contractual
interest
and
indeed
the
united
states
acknowledges
on
page
7
of
its
brief
that
that
issue
is
irrelevant
to
the
case
before
the
court.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
well
at
this
point
mr.
chief
justice,
the
respondent
would
be
entitled
to
nothing.
she
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
survivor's
benefit
and
she
would
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
it
remains
in
the
fund.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
the
trust
account
fund,
it
is
forfeited.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
exactly.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
she
would
receive
a
survivor's
benefit.
she
would
not
receive
a
spouse
benefit.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
yes.
if
on
remand
and
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
is
affirmed
the
petitioner
--
the
respondent
will
not
be
claiming
a
50%
interest
in
petitioner's
benefits.s
he
would
be
entitled
only
to
50%
of
the
community
property
interest
that
being
the
amount
which
is
attributable
to
employment
during
the
marriage.
that
amount
in
this
case
will
be
less
than
20%,
as
it
respects
respondent.
as
it's
pointed
out
by
the
respondent's
brief,
the
court
is
not
required
to
give
respondent
50%
or
even
20%
of
the
benefits
to
respondent
as
they
received
by
the
petitioner
because
the
court
can
award
an
alternative
item
of
community
property
or
can
award
to
the
spouse
of
a
portion
of
the
railroad
retirement
benefits
after
they
all
received.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
earlier
in
the
case,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
funds
could
be
garnished
or
executed
upon
--
once
the
funds
are
in
the
bank
account,
at
least
one
court,
the
superior
court
in
pennsylvania
and
the
commonwealth
versus
berfield
cited
in
the
respondents
in
that
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
national
organization
for
women
shows
that
in
that
case,
the
court
decided
that
funds
could
be
garnished,
once
those
funds
were
in
the
hands
of
the
petitioner
or
in
that
case
as
they
were
in
the
hands
of
the
bank.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice,
for
reasons
unknown
to
me
that
the
attorney
who
tried
the
case
did
waive
spousal
support,
and
i
believed
that
on
remand,
the
respondent
would
not
be
entitled
to
claim
any
more
spousal
support.
as
you
correctly
stated,
technically
the
issue
of
family
law,
doctrine
says
they're
applied
in
california
is
really
not
an
issue.
in
this
court,
it's
not
something
to
be
determined
by
this
court.
this
court
stated
in
united
states
versus
yazell
that
both
that
theory
and
the
precedence
of
this
court
teach
us
solicitude
for
state
interest.
particularly
in
the
field
of
family
and
property
arrangements
they
should
be
overridden
by
federal
courts
only
where
clearance
substantial
interest
of
the
national
government
which
cannot
be
served
consistently
with
respect
for
such
interest
will
suffer
major
damage
if
the
state
law
is
applied.
we
submit
that
congress
has
not
act
too
clearly
in
declaring
that
the
state
lawsuit
was
preempted
and
that
there
is
no
interest
of
the
national
government
which
will
suffer
major
damage
if
the
state
laws
applied.
in
wissner
versus
wissner,
there
was
a
clear
intent
of
the
national
government
in
protecting
the
morale
of
the
servicemen
in
making
life
insurance
available
to
them
at
a
reasonable
cause.
this
was
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
excuse
me
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
howard
m.
fields
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
statute
saying
that
california
cannot
do
this.
we
submit
that
neither
231m
nor
231d
clearly
state
that
california
cannot
do
what
california
has
done
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
the
anticipation.
anticipation
is
really
a
word
of
art
that
we
submit
that
231m,
the
exemption
for
execution
statute
was
merely
an
exemption
from
an
execution
statute
which
as
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
act
was
passed.
this
was
in
1935,
and
in
the
19
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
it
is
a
word
of
our
taking
out
of
spendthrift
trusts.
if
you
read
that,
this
the
way
that
petitioner
believe
it
should
be
read,
you
can
also
argue
that
the
petition,
that
respondent
has
anticipating
that
the
husband
will
receive
this
benefits
but
the
husband
himself
is
anticipating
that
he
too
will
receive
this
benefit
at
some
time
in
the
future
by
varied
by
petitioner's
own
reading
of
that
statute,
this
court
has
to
conclude
we
believe
that
the
petitioner
himself
cannot
anticipate
those
benefits.
it's
merely
a
word
of
art.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
now,
the
statute
does
not
say,
the
wife
cannot
collect
and
you
also
have
to
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
the
75
amendment,
merely
speaks
--
are
you
talking
about
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
we
do
not
believe
that
the
75
amendment
was
directed
to
the
wife
who
we
believe
to
be
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
the
77
amendment
regarding
garnishment
expressly
--
it
does
not
recognize
a
community
interest
but
you
have
to
look
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
enactment
of
that
legislation.
congress
was
trying
to
combat
welfare
recipient
increases
in
the
rate
of
the
welfare
rules
because
husbands
and
fathers
were
able
to
avoid
their
support
obligations.
and
under
the
77
amendment,
congress
determined
that
it
would
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
in
order
to
permit
the
states
to
have
the
recipients
of
welfare
benefits
assigned
to
those
benefits.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
no,
it
did
not.
there
is
really
no
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
it
could
have
mr.
justice
marshall
but
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
it
prohibits
garnishment
of
the
retirement
funds
by
the
respondent
but
that
statute
does
not
prohibit
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
i
meant
--
we
submit
mr.
justice
marshall
that
congress
was
only
addressing
that
one
problem,
that
problem
of
fathers
and
husbands
evading
their
support
obligations
rather
than
their
community
property
obligations.
there
is
absolutely
no
history
in
the
legislature
that
the
congress
intended
to
prohibit
wives
from
obtaining
any
type
of
benefit.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
well,
legal
proceeding
is
also
what
we
contend
in
a
word
of
art.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
yes,
but
the
mere
adding
up
of
an
asset
in
a
community
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
well,
the
divorce
is
a
legal
proceeding
but
the
aspect
of
adding
up
this
benefit
as
a
community
property
asset
is
really
not
a
legal
process
per
se.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
my
answer
was
that
again,
this
was
a
word
included
in
an
exemption
statute
enacted
during
the
depression.
it
was
--
we
believed
taken
out
of
contexts,
out
of
the
language
of
the
spendthrift
trust
and
if
we
follow
through
in
petitioner's
argument
that
the
court
cannot
evaluate
the
community
interest
in
this
benefit
because
the
respondent
would
be
anticipating
that
benefit.
it
must
also
be
concluded
that
the
petitioner
himself
is
anticipating
that
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
i
believe
that
it's
redundant,
that
it
was
inserted
in
there
by
someone
who
is
drafting
that
particular
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
no,
i
personally
do
not
believe
it
means
anything
more
than
that
and
there's
no
history
especially
as
indicated
in
the
1935
hearing
reports
cited
on
our
brief
that
congress
intended
by
that
schedule
to
preempt
--
mr.
howard
m.
fields
it's
totally
redundant.
there
is
no
intent
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
state
family
law
concepts.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
well,
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
if
he
dies
before
age
60,
the
amount
of
his
contributions
to
the
fund
would
be
forfeited.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
yes.
yes
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
m.
fields
yes.
but
as
pointed
out
by
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
members
of
congress,
one
of
the
objections
post
during
the
period
in
which
the
congress
was
considering
this
piece
of
legislation
was
that
community
property
and
the
state
domestic
relations
law
is
really
an
area
of
state
concern,
not
an
area
of
federal
concern.
in
the
area
of
family
law,
this
court
frequently
defers
to
state
law
in
that
regard.
it
is
simply
not
a
federal
--
it's
not
an
area
of
federal
involvement.
it
would
to
accept
the
respondent's
argument
as
further
advanced
by
the
united
states
which
i
might
add
was
contradicted
this
morning
by
mrs.
stillman,
the
point
that
the
california
court
cannot
take
into
account
alimony.
this
is
contradicted
on
pages
22
and
23
of
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
which
the
united
states
is
really
advanced
in
the
argument
that
the
federal
government
should
somehow
get
involved
in
needs
of
the
divorce
spouses.
