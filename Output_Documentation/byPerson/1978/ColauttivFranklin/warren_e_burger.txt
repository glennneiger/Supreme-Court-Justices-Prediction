chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
to
number
891,
beal
for
the
state
of
pennsylvania
against
franklin.
mrs.
mansmann
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
mean
that
his
judgment
and
experience
must
be
exercised
in
terms
of
reasonable
medical
certainty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
that
language
also
must
be
read
as
meaning
that
the
decision
must
be
based
on
reasonable
medical
certainty
as
medical
opinions
are
always
gauged
in
litigation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
would
embrace
would
it
in
your
view
a
bad
judgment
suppose
you
have
a
general
practitioner
who
does
not
specialize
in
obstetrics,
but
he
is
--
finds
himself
in
a
situation
where
he
must
make
the
judgment
under
this
statute.
is
he
not
at
risk
on
the
basis
of
your
own
suggestion
about
the
experts,
that
in
making
the
judgment
he
made
not
three,
but
12
obstetricians
might
say
he
was
wrong
and
meanwhile
he
is
at
least
open
possibly
to
a
criminal
prosecution,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
may
--
he
might
not
be
convicted,
but
that's
not
the
only
question
that
we
deal
within
a
criminal
statute,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
we
aren't
primarily
concerned
here
with
the
good
faith
of
the
people
who
have
presented
views
on
this.
isn't
our
task
limited
to
determining
whether
the
state
of
pennsylvania
has
undertaken
to
protect
human
life
with
the
kind
of
precision
that
is
traditionally
required
in
criminal
penal
statutes,
isn't
that
the
only
question
before
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
criminal
statute
said
not
in
frequently
fail
because
of
the
choice
of
words,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mrs.
mansmann.
mr.
morris?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
speaking
of
an
intrusion
on
the
parents'
right
or
the
intrusion
on
the
physician?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
(voice
overlap)
before
this
court
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
this
statute
provides
sufficient
guidance
informs
a
physician
when
he
will
be
transgressing
the
criminal
law
as
distinguished
from
any
other
liability
he
may
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
only
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
he
not
have
another
alternative
if
he
determines
on
reasonable
medical
certainty
that
the
fetus
may
be
viable,
he
can
decline
to
perform
the
operation,
can
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
mr.
morris
that
in
both
section
5
(a)
and
in
the
other
sections,
the
judgment
is
one
that
requires
reading
into
the
statute
but
it's
based
on
reasonable
medical
certainty
on
what
is
then
in
it
--
known
about
the
subject.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-891,
colautti,
the
secretary
of
welfare
of
pennsylvania
against
franklin
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
