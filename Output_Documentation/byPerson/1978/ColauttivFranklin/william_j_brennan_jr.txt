justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
mansmann,
you
--
i
think
you've
taken
inconsistent
positions.
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
if
you
get
three
experts
to
testify
at
anything,
isn't
there
a
risk
that
a
doctor
in
good
faith
could
conclude
that
a
fetus
is
not
viable
and
nevertheless
that
the
prosecutor
might
be
able
to
get
three
experts
who
would
disagree.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
that
could
happen?
do
you
think
that
could
happen
or
could
not
happen?
that's
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
could
not
happen
when
a
doctor
in
good
faith
concluded
that
the
fetus
was
not
viable
and
that
there
will
be
three
doctors
who
would
--
could
be
found,
who
would
testify
in
the
witness
stand
that
he
was
wrong.
you
don't
think
that
could
ever
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
prosecutor
is
not
short
for
funds
to
find
experts,
is
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
now,
you
are
saying
that
he
could
not
find
three
experts
who
could
ever
give
such
testimony
whenever
a
doctor
in
good
faith
was
satisfied
that
the
fetus
was
not
viable.
that
could
never
happen
here,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
your
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
standard
of
care
the
doctor
has
held
to
there
is
held
to
in
--
under
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
--
is
that
standard,
what
is
that
standard,
reasonable
medical
--?
