may
i
ask
a
question?
unknown
speaker
what
is
may
be
viable
--
had
to
viable?
unknown
speaker
what
the
state
did
--
unknown
speaker
maybe
possible,
sufficient
reason
for
whom
to
believe,
this
being
for
the
doctor
who's
going
to
perform
the
abortion
or
for
somebody
looking
at
it
later?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
get
it,
supposing
he
makes
a
determination
that
it's
not
viable,
he
says,
“i'm
satisfied,
it's
not
viable.”
and
later
on,
three
other
doctors
say,
“well,
he
made
a
wrong
determination,
it
might
have
been
viable.”
would
this
--
well,
how
do
you
handle
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
his
subjective
determination
that's
controlling?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morris
i'm
not
sure
these
differences
and
time
periods
necessarily
reflect
the
difference
in
definition
of
viability,
do
they?
the
statute
attempts
to
define
it
in
terms
of
capability
of
surviving
and
so
forth.
i
gave
you
those,
sir,
for
this
reason.
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
opponent
conceded
this
that
there
are
different
time
periods.
