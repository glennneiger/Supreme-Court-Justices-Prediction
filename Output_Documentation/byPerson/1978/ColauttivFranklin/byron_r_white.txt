justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
what
if
the
doctor
who
was
just
attending
the
mother
in
a
normal
birth
and
the
baby
died?
now
i
suppose
the
doctor
faces
a
possibility
of
criminal
negligence.
and
if
two
doctors
testified
against
him
at
the
trial
they
might
be
more
articulate
than
he
was.
that's
the
standard
isn't
it
that's
applied
in
this
case,
the
same
standard
as
if
he
were
attending
a
normal
birth.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
that
right
or
not?
is
that
the
standard
the
statute
applies?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
but
nevertheless
in
all
sort
of
situations
including
attending
a
normal
birth
a
doctor
might
be
charge
with
criminal
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
to
face
a
jury
trial
on
it,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
attending
a
birth
of
a
--
attending
a
normal
birth.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
we
talking
about
under
the
statute
if
the
doctor
determines
--
makes
a
determination
that
the
fetus
may
be
viable
then
he
simply
engages
--
he
performs
the
abortion
in
a
manner
that
would
be
best
calculated
to
preserve
life.
is
that
what
the
statute
requires?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
if
he
makes
the
determination
that
it
won't
be
viable
then
he
need
not
do
the
abortion
in
that
manner.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
also
perform
it
as
long
as
he
use
the
methods
best
calculated
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
fetus.
justice
byron
r.
white
can't
the
doctor
always
protect
himself
though
by
using
what
perhaps
wouldn't
be
so
questionable
or
arguable,
the
--
use
the
method,
the
aborting
method
best
calculated
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
fetus?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what's
at
issue
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it
may
be
--
that
may
be,
but
all
you're
requiring
the
doctor
to
do
is
to
use
that
method
best
calculated
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
fetus.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
been
talking
the
entire
time
about
the
decision
to
this
--
of
what
--
about
viability.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
that's
a
difficult
question
if
he
determines
that
it's
may
be
viable
he
merely
has
to
use
some
--
and
i
know
you
don't
think
the
word
merely
would
be
appropriate,
but
he
nevertheless
just
has
to
use
that
method
best
calculated
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
fetus.
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
suggesting
that
danforth
held
that
the
mother
--
the
putative
mother
and
the
doctor
are
entitled
to
have
any
method
of
abortion
they
want
even
though
the
fetus
may
be
viable.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
to
say
that
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
be
making
this
argument
is
the
statute
were
limited
to
civil
liability?
cause
the
statute
does
say
civil
or
criminal,
as
might
be
applicable
in
the
case
of
normal
birth?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
would
you
be
making
this
argument
if
it
were
just
a
civil
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
state
just
passed
this
very
same
law
with
respect
to
the
third
trimester?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
doctor
has
to
make
determination
and
then
use
the
best
methods
available
to
save
the
life
of
the
fetus.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
that
vague
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
an
impossible
determination
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
been
--
in
your
entire
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
in
my
hypothetical
on
the
third
trimester
that
it
would
not
be
vague?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
a
doctor
might
determine
that
this
baby
is
--
fetus
won't
be
viable
and
two
doctors
might
disagree
with
him
before
a
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
the
same
test,
the
same
general
standard
as
would
apply
to
a
live
birth?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
morris,
it's
a
--
but
that's
the
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
however
difficult
it
might
be
to
apply
it,
if
that's
the
standard.
