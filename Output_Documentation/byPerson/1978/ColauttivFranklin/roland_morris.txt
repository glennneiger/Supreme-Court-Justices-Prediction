mr.
roland
morris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
lower
court
in
this
case
chose
two
distinct
if
interrelated
lines
of
analysis
with
which
to
approach
this
statutory
language.
their
first
line
was
based
on
an
assessment
of
the
substantive
legal
architecture
which
this
court
mainly
through
mr.
justice
blackmun's
opinions
has
accorded
the
abortion
question
as
a
whole.
the
second
line
of
analysis
which
the
lower
court
employed
related
to
that
doctrine
generally
known
as
the
void
for
vagueness
concept
as
applied
by
this
court
to
its
work.
the
lower
court
found
and
i
submit
to
you
here
correctly
that
with
respect
to
both
lines
of
analysis
the
pennsylvania
statute
failed
its
constitutional
tasks.
first,
it
carved
out
areas
in
which
the
state
intruded
its
interests
in
the
abortion
context
which
areas
precede
that
time
with
in
which
this
court
has
found
a
state
had
a
compelling
interest.
secondly,
the
court
found
that
the
statute
as
applied
to
an
individual
under
whatever
source
you
use
in
the
void
for
vagueness
analysis
failed
to
provide
sufficiently
precise
information
with
respect
to
which
an
individual
could
judge
his
criminal
liability
and
i
might
add
there
is
a
civil
liability
concept
in
the
statute
as
you
will
see
paragraph
two.
let
me
first,
if
i
may,
address
myself
to
the
substantive
abortion
question
as
it
has
been
described
by
this
court,
i
think
the
major
two
cases
that
we
would
all
agree
were
roe
and
danforth
as
they
apply
in
this
case.
we
don't
have
here
a
maher
case
or
a
bellotti
case.
we
have
here
a
straight
roe
statute
passed
after
roe
which
was
very
similar
to
the
statute
in
danforth.
the
court
will
remember
that
danforth
also
included
as
did
the
pennsylvania
statute
issues
of
consent
but
they
are
not
now
before
the
court.
the
danforth
--
court
likewise
was
faced
with
a
question
respecting
what
protection
had
to
be
given
to
the
fetus
and
the
danforth
statute
provided
somewhat
more
sweepingly
than
the
pennsylvania
statute
that
if
an
abortion
were
to
be
performed,
the
fetus
had
to
be
accorded
that
method
of
performance
which
would
most
certainly
assure
its
life
if
it
were
viable.
that
was
the
way
the
danforth
statute
approached
the
situation.
incidentally
both
the
danforth
statute
and
the
hodgson
statute
provided
that
if
you
did
deliver
such
a
viable
fetus
for
the
fact
that
the
parents
didn't
want
it
and
that
provided
a
sort
of
an
escape
clause,
the
state
would
take
over
the
fetus.
so
the
motive
was
acknowledged
by
the
statutes.
this
court
in
danforth
held
that
to
require
the
fetus
to
be
delivered
in
that
fashion
even
though
it
were
in
the
first
trimester
for
example
carved
out
an
area
to
which
this
court
had
denied
states
entrance
and
properly
so
because
the
state
entering
an
area
of
individual
liberty
of
individual
privacy
intrudes
as
a
rather
blunt
instrument.
and
you
have
laid
out
areas
in
concept
at
least
in
which
a
state
may
not
intrude.
it
is
these
areas
which
the
“may
be
viable”
language,
the
lower
court
found
and
i
submit
on
the
face
of
the
language
let
alone
its
interpretation,
clearly
intrudes.
mr.
roland
morris
i'm
speaking
of
an
intrusion
on
both
rights,
sir,
and
of
course
under
doe,
i
come
before
you
asserting
the
rights
of
the
parents.
however,
i
think
that
was
decided
in
that
fashion
by
the
lower
court
properly
under
doe
and
remains
the
concept
in
this
court.
i
therefore
assert
both
rights.
i
think
that
underlying
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
in
connection
with
those
rights
was
an
acknowledgment
by
the
court
that
as
you
dealt
with
this
area
and
that
kind
of
private
consultation,
it
was
probably
impossible
and
definitely
unwise
to
seek
to
pull
those
interest
apart
for
the
purpose
of
legal
analysis.
so
i
come
before
you
asserting
both
rights
sir.
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
in
connection
with
the
“may
be”
language
and
what
kind
of
area
it
carves
into
under
the
abortion
architecture
to
the
actual
evidence
of
record.
it
is
not
true
that
there
was
anything
which
could
be
called
a
consensus
regarding
the
definition
of
viability,
let
alone
“may
be
viable.”
the
appellee
dr.
franklin
in
this
case
placed
viability
at
approximately
28
weeks.
dr.
gerstley,
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs,
here
the
appellees,
put
viability
at
about
24
weeks.
dr.
keenan
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
appellants
here
put
viability
at
20
to
26
weeks
and
was
fairly
soft
in
his
judgment.
dr.
mecklenburg
the
lower
court
read
as
fairly
placing
viability
or
at
least
a
high
possibility
of
viability
at
20
weeks.
dr.
hervada
who
was
called
by
the
--
mr.
roland
morris
i
suggest
that
to
the
court
for
this
reason,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
proper
as
the
court
has
to
define
viability
in
the
sense
that
it
does,
that
does
not
mean
like
connolly
or
winters
that
a
state
legislature
may
take
that
concept
and
use
that
language
to
apply
it
to
an
individual.
it
may
not
be
sufficiently
precise
for
that
purpose
although
it
maybe
sufficiently
precise
for
this
court
to
use
it
as
a
concept
which
will
in
palko
language
provide
order
to
liberty.
you
may
be
able
to
do
it,
the
legislature
you
may
not.
mr.
roland
morris
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
morris
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
morris
i
believe
it
is
sir
and
one
might
bear
in
mind
that
if
dr.
franklin
aborted
a
28-week
fetus,
he
might
well
be
faced
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
by
drs.
mecklenburg
and
keenan
who
might
well
be
more
articulate
to
a
jury
than
he
was
and
who
might
well
convince
that
jury
that
it
was
at
least
wanton
disregard
if
not
knowledgeable
disregard
of
life
and
he
should
not
be
so
inhibited.
that
inhibition
also
applies
in
the
vagueness
concept
but
that
inhibition
is
what
--
is
carving
out
in
this
--
mr.
roland
morris
you
are
coming,
however
sir,
to
--
mr.
roland
morris
the
language
of
the
standard
is
the
same.
the
method
of
its
application
is
different.
mr.
roland
morris
yes
and
may
i
explain
--
mr.
roland
morris
the
--
in
--
the
language
of
the
standard
you
use
is
precisely
correct,
sir.
may
i
explain
why
in
application
it
is
different?
we
are
speaking
now
of
an
area
that
is
not
only
highly
emotionally
charge
but
also
of
an
area
in
which
there
is
more
than
substantive
disagreement.
mr.
roland
morris
considerably,
sir.
the
evidence
in
this
record
shows
and
the
lower
court
found
a
wide
disparity
in
the
time
periods
but
that
isn't
all
one
is
face
with
when
making
this
judgment
unlike
a
live
birth.
with
a
live
birth
you
have
and
can
look
at
a
baby
whose
chances
of
living
are
reasonably
well
established.
here
we're
dealing
with
exactly
that
period
of
time
when
it's
impossible,
i
submit
on
this
record,
to
establish
the
viability
let
alone
the
“may
be
viable”
and
you
can't
even
look
at
the
fetus
directly,
although
there
are
some
new
techniques
which
were
providing
that.
if
i
may,
sirs,
bear
in
mind
that
the
doctor
does
at
least
takes
at
least
four
steps
each
of
which
involves
an
estimate,
the
doctor
makes
an
estimate.
mr.
roland
morris
the
difficultly
sir
--
oh,
yes
it
does.
mr.
roland
morris
yes.
mr.
roland
morris
yes,
and
in
each
of
those
cases
--
mr.
roland
morris
in
both
your
case
mr.
justice
white
and
in
the
case
of
the
chief
justice,
i
ask
you
to
look
carefully
at
what
you
are
doing
to
that
area
in
which
you
said
the
court
should
not
and
may
not
intrude,
the
state
should
not
and
may
not
intrude.
mr.
roland
morris
i
submit
to
you
--
mr.
roland
morris
i
--
it
is
at
issue
and
i
submit
to
you
at
that
point
in
time
you
are
clearly
inhibiting,
clearly
carving
out
an
area
which
may
run
well
into
--
mr.
roland
morris
in
that
case
i
would
have
to
ask
mr.
justice
--
mr.
roland
morris
whether
it
is.
mr.
roland
morris
in
this
case
--
yes.
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
the
case
which
settles
that
issue
is
the
danforth
case
because
you
could
ask
the
same
question
to
the
danforth
case
and
say
why
don't
we
just
require
every
doctor
to
deliver
every
fetus
in
that
way
which
will
most
likely
save
the
life
of
the
fetus.
that
resolves
the
entire
problem
if
you
adopt
that
line
of
reasoning
but
that
is
the
line
of
reasoning
which
the
court
has
not
adopted
and
i
submitted
would
be
tragic
if
they
did
adopt
it
because
--
yes
sir?
mr.
roland
morris
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
you
sir.
mr.
roland
morris
i
simply
wanted
to
say
that
the
counter
veiling
question,
the
counter
veiling
pull
and
there
are
many
of
course
in
this
case
is
that
privacy
pull,
wherever
you
find
the
source
of
it.
that
decision
at
some
point
should
and
does
under
the
decisions
as
you
written
into
date
belong
to
the
woman
and
her
doctor.
and
that
decision
as
danforth
made
it
clear
and
i
think
roe
--
mr.
roland
morris
yes
sir,
because
--
for
one
reason
may
be
viable
is
a
point
which
i
think
the
record
discloses
cannot
be
determine
in
a
precise
enough
way
to
permit
the
state
with
its
panoply
of
power,
its
policeman,
its
judges
to
intrude
on
that
decision.
mr.
roland
morris
i
would,
sir,
in
the
first
trimester
--
mr.
roland
morris
in
the
second,
yes,
i
would
sir
but
i
don't
think
you
face
that
it
--
mr.
roland
morris
i
don't
think
you
face
that
issue
in
this
case
for
this
reason.
there
is
enough
--
you
can
face
it
and
i
will
and
i
will
go
that
far.
however,
in
diagnosing
that
particular
standard
which
will
support
a
criminal
statute
you
have
a
whole
separate
problem,
how
do
you
determine
it,
how
does
the
individual
know.
mr.
roland
morris
yes,
it
does,
sir.
mr.
roland
morris
yes,
i
would
sir,
although
again
i
do
not
address
myself
here
to
that
argument.
i
submit
to
you
--
mr.
roland
morris
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
morris
no
sir,
but
on
the
ground
for
a
reason
that
i
do
not
believe
is
before
this
court.
as
i
think
i
suggested
moment
ago
and
i
think
--
mr.
roland
morris
yes
sir,
that's
precisely
where
i
would
now
go
with
my
argument.
it
does
not
mean
--
mr.
roland
morris
if
it
would
depend
on
whether
they
were
criminal
sanction
and
what
he
had
to
do
when
he
determined
viability.
if
you
assume
that
he
had
to
determine
viability
and
you
applied
a
criminal
sanction
for
reasons
not
before
you
in
this
case
but
based
on
winters'
and
screws'
i
would
have
to
say
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
it
is
not
a
hasten
to
add
to
say
--
mr.
roland
morris
your
honor
that's
not
how
i
reach
that
result
and
that
result
i
would
not
concur
with.
i
reached
the
result
for
this
reason,
you
do
not
sit
here
as
a
legislature
drafting
the
precise
language
under
palko
and
griswold
i
see
your
work
as
defining
the
concept
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
adoption
of
your
language
in
a
statute
will
satisfy
the
requirements
of
certainty.
and
i
believe,
although
this
question
is
not
before
you
but
having
been
asked
that
a
state
legislature
implementing
the
concept
which
you
have
structured
would
be
required
to
be
more
precise
than
your
language
is
and
would
also
be
required
under
winters'
and
keyishian
is
another
one
to
move
or
wait
its
language
to
provide
a
breathing
space
for
that
privacy
right
which
we
are
discussing
here
today.
mr.
roland
morris
i
believe
he
could
be
held
to
the
same
performance
sir.
mr.
roland
morris
i
think
at
least
in
the
case
as
i
saw
your
question
i
was
looking
to
a
civil
liability
and
in
the
case
of
civil
liability
these
penumbras
surrounding
the
bill
of
rights,
this
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
right,
i
don't
think
has
the
same
impact.
in
fact,
it
has
no
impact
in
the
line
of
criminal
question.
mr.
roland
morris
oh,
in
a
criminal
liability
case,
sir,
i
think
to
the
extent
you
found
it
to
be
a
private
area
and
i
have
to
think
about
an
appendectomy,
i
would
think
you
will
have
to
give
some
consideration
to
moving
the
test,
the
precise
test
sufficiently
out
so
that
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
criminal
act
so
that
there
wasn't
a
vagary
of
distinction.
mr.
roland
morris
but
i
don't
think
that's
his
--
as
personal
in
area
over
here.
mr.
roland
morris
yes,
i
would
think
so
if
it
were
precise
enough
on
what
the
guidelines
were.
mr.
roland
morris
if
it
may
be
viable
during
the
third
trimester?
mr.
roland
morris
this
requires
me
and
i'm
quite
willing
to
do
so
--
mr.
roland
morris
no
sir.
mr.
roland
morris
no,
sir,
and
it
--
but
it
requires
me
to
take
a
step
under
roe
which
i
think
and
one
always
hesitates
to
interpret
the
language
of
mr.
justice
blackmun
who
wrote
it,
i
--
mr.
roland
morris
i'm
trying
sir,
i'm
trying
to
--
and
i
read
roe,
sir,
originally
as
requiring
a
flexible
standard
and
you
made
that
clear
in
danforth.
as
flexible
as
it
is
whatever
line
the
state
legislature
draws
must
be
one
that
is
clearly
not
invasive.
that's
why
i
answered
mr.
justice
powell
the
way
i
did.
mr.
roland
morris
no,
i
think
we
could
establish
now
although
i
don't
believe
this
record
does
it
and
the
question
--
mr.
roland
morris
i
believe
and
i
speak
as
to
the
record
now
that
we
have
reached
a
medical
point
given
ultrasound
where
a
definition
placed
at
the
third
trimester
would
probably
stand
up
and
properly
so.
i
think
it
would
inevitably
have
to
subject
to
constitutional
testimony
at
a
legislative
hearing
and
probably
in
the
court,
but
i
think
it
would
stand
up
because
it
is
sufficient
definite.
you're
making
two
decisions
there.
it's
clearly
definite
if
you
can
get
the
age
close.
the
other
decision
is
have
you
invaded
that
area
which
i
submit
to
you
roe
and
danforth
established
as
protective.
and
i
think
now
we
can
demonstrate
that
in
the
third
trimester
you
would
not
be
invaded.
mr.
roland
morris
yes,
i
do,
sir,
if
what
you're
asking
me
is,
is
there
an
objective
legal
tests
for
the
--
as
opposed
to
the
doctor's
judgment
being
controlling.
the
doctor's
judgment
can
be
questioned
under
the
statute
and
that
has
never
been
questioned
by
the
appellants
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
roland
morris
yes.
mr.
roland
morris
yes
sir,
the
def
--
i
agree
--
mr.
roland
morris
reasonable
medical
certainty.
the
difficulty,
sir,
is
that
with
a
live
birth
you
have
a
situation
where
it
can
be
determined.
we
are
now
--
mr.
roland
morris
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
morris
yes
and
when
subjecting
a
man
i
submit
to
the
court
to
a
situation
which
if
he
makes
the
wrong
judgment
invokes
a
criminal
penalty.
then
i
think
the
judgment
must
be
made
at
least
humanly
possible
and
i
submit
in
this
case
it
isn't.
finally,
let
me
turn
if
i
may
from
the
area
which
is
carved
out
of
roe
and
danforth
by
the
“may
be
viable”
language
and
incidentally
in
hodgson,
the
eight
circuit
so
found
on
the
words
potentially
viable
the
appeal
was
dismissed
in
that
case.
and
moved
then
to
what
i
think
you
must
do
on
a
vagueness
analysis
and
i
will
make
this
brief
but
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
starting
with
thornhill
moving
through
connolly
and
winters
and
keyishian
now,
you
have
clearly
when
an
individual
right
was
inhibited
or
circumscribed
or
threatened,
held
the
statute
or
the
state
officer
to
a
high
standard
of
certainly.
it
is
not
sufficient
when
threatening
an
individual
right
as
you
do
here
with
respect
to
both
doctor
and
the
mother
both
of
which
rights
we
assert,
to
say
as
you
might
to
a
state
officer
your
actions
must
be
constitutional.
you
may
say
that
to
a
state.
indeed
under
civil
rights
statutes
you
have
convicted
state
officers
for
that.
but
that
i
think
you
have
been
unwilling
to
say,
and
i
ask
you
to
remain
continuingly
unwilling
to
say,
that
you
may
make
a
private
citizen
operating
in
an
area
which
maybe
protected
and
which
is
private
subject
to
the
same
standard.
and
if
this
statute
if
any
statute
accomplishes
precisely
that
goal,
i
think
roe
suggested
the
conclusion.
i
think
danforth
and
hodgson
make
it
clear.
thank
you,
sirs.
