mr.
morris
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
ask
this
question?
if
the
clause
that
includes
a
may
be
viable
language
were
omitted
from
this
section
of
the
statute,
would
that
meet
your
objections?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
the
remaining
language
be
subject
to
an
attack
for
voidness?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
the
mere
requirement
that
a
doctor
determine
viability
in
view
of
all
that
you've
said
about
the
difficulty
of
that
present
a
voidness
issue
in
any
of
these
statutes?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
want
to
understand
you
--
that
the
question
of
viability
would
have
to
be
left
to
the
good
faith
discretion
of
the
physician
in
every
case
that
he
could
not
be
held
liable,
criminally
or
regardless
of
whether
or
not
he
exercised
his
judgment
with
gross
recklessness?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
appeal
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
court
of
pennsylvania.
it
is
still
yet
another
in
the
series
of
cases
relating
to
state
regulation
of
abortion
procedures.
at
issue
here
is
the
pennsylvania
abortion
control
act
of
1974
which
is
enacted
over
the
governor's
veto
in
the
year
following
this
court's
decisions
in
roe
against
wade
and
doe
against
bolton.
section
5
(a)
of
that
act
requires
every
person
who
performs
an
abortion
to
make
a
determination
based
on
his
experience,
judgment,
or
professional
competence
that
the
fetus
is
not
viable
if
he
determines
that
the
fetus
is
viable
or
the
statute
reads
if
there
is
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
the
fetus
may
be
viable
then
he
must
exercise
the
same
care
to
preserve
the
life
and
health
of
the
fetus
as
would
be
required
in
the
case
of
one
intended
to
be
born
alive.
he
must
also
use
the
abortion
technique
providing
the
best
opportunity
for
the
fetus
to
be
born
alive
so
long
as
a
different
technique
is
not
necessary
to
preserve
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother.
section
5
(d)
imposes
a
criminal
sanction
for
a
violation
of
the
foregoing
statute.
the
present
suit
was
instituted
by
the
appellees,
a
licensed
physician
and
certain
organizations
against
pennsylvania
officials
challenging
the
statute
on
constitutional
grounds.
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
among
other
things
held
that
section
5
(a)
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reaffirm
that
ruling
and
hold
that
the
viability
determination
requirement
is
void
for
vagueness
and
that
the
standard
of
care
provision
is
likewise
impermissibly
vague.
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
