justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
counsel
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
a
number
of
different
standards,
they're
traditionally
important
to
the
law,
one
is
good
faith,
the
other
is
negligence
and
other
is
gross
negligence
or
recklessness,
another
is
intent
to
kill.
what
standard
does
this
statute
apply?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
nobody
--
i
don't
think
anybody
quarrels
with
that,
i
think
the
difficulties
are
when
you
begin
going
down
the
scale
from
actual
intent
to
kill.
and
the
--
i
think
the
question
of
some
my
colleagues
had
asked
reveal
some
puzzlement
as
to
just
what
standard
it
is
the
commonwealth
is
imposing
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
--
what
standard
does
the
law
impose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
standard
is
required
for
a
conviction
of
physician
of
manslaughter
in
pennsylvania,
is
simple
negligence
sufficient?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
something
more
than
simple
negligence,
but
less
than
actual
intent
to
kill.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
woman
and
the
doctor
at
a
certain
stage
are
entitled
to
decide
that
they
want
the
fetus
to
die
even
though
it
might
be
made
viable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
beyond
the
first
trimester?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
doctor
that
can't
be
held
to
the
same
responsibility
in
the
performance
of
an
abortion
that
he
could
be
held
to
be
--
held
to
in
the
performance
of
appendectomy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
if
key
--
well,
you've
said
there's
breathing
space
necessary
in
the
case
of
an
appendectomy
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
criminal
liability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
--
if
you
say
it's
clear
that
it's
a
criminal
act,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent.
is
the
state
entitled
to
make
criminal
gross
negligence
on
the
part
of
a
physician
in
performing
a
recognized
medical
procedure
whether
it's
abortion,
appendectomy
or
heart
surgery?
