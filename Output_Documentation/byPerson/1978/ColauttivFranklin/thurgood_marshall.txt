what
do
you
do
with
the
difference
between
the
small
one
doctor
in
the
town
in
philadelphia
and
pittsburg
hospitals
or
what
may
be,
does
that
rule
of
doctor
have
what
the
word
was
yesterday?
the
answer
is
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
the
statute
say
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
you
called
in
three
experts,
real
experts
and
they
don't
agree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
but
my
hypothetical
is
they
did
disagree,
what
do
you
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
in
any
way
as
a
doctor,
i
can
be
sure
if
they
get
three
experts
and
they
all
agree.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
right,
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn't
it
be
the
only
way
i
could
be
sure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
just
happen
to
know
some
people,
they
couldn't
afford
three
experts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
some
people
that
couldn't
afford
three
experts.
have
you
pushed
me,
i
know
some
that
couldn't
afford
one.
well,
how
did
they
get
their
abortions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
mansmann
--
excuse
me,
go
ahead
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
not
interested
in
ethical
abortion.
i'm
interested
in
the
law
which
tells
a
doctor
that
if
you
made
a
mistake,
you
go
to
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i'm
worried
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
happen
if
he
makes
a
mistake
and
cuts
your
head
off
and
instead
your
foot.
is
there
a
statute
that
punishes
him
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
there
a
statute
that
punishes
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
statute
is
that
that
says
a
doctor
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
this
one
doesn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
one
isn't
a
general
statute.
this
one
only
applies
to
people
who
perform
abortions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
all
this
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
give
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
i
would
like
to
get
a
question
out.
so,
just
go
right
ahead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
not
at
all.
