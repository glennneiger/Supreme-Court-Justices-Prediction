ms.

thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
especially
appointed
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
i
serve
as
trial
counsel
with
my
co-counsel
and
husband,
jerome
mansmann,
who
was
also
especially
appointed
and
we
have
been
representing
the
commonwealth's
interest
in
this
litigation
since
it's
inception
in
1974.
the
case
that
we
bring
before
you
today
involves
only
one
section
of
pennsylvania's
abortion
control
act
which
was
passed
in
1974.
all
other
challenges
and
issues
have
been
resolved
upon
remand
by
this
court
to
the
lower
court.
in
a
nutshell,
pennsylvania
law
provides
or
prohibits
all
abortions
after
viability
except
for
the
abortion
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
mother's
life
or
health.
this
particular
section
which
is
6
(b)
is
not
in
dispute,
is
not
an
issue
here
before
this
court.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
yes
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
no,
it
is
not
your
honor,
it's
the
capability
of
the
fetus
to
survive
outside
the
mother's
womb
although
with
artificial
aid.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
section
5
(a)
which
does
not
prohibit
abortions,
but
which
is
the
subject
of
this
appeal,
the
physician
is
required
prior
to
perform
an
abortion
to
make
a
determination
that
the
fetus
is
not
viable,
based
on
his
own
experience,
judgment
or
professional
competence.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
certainly
it
would
your
honor.
and
i
think
what
the
legislature
clearly
intended
there
and
it
exemplifies
that
in
the
section
that
immediately
follows
that
particular
phrase
in
giving
in
objective
standard
for
physicians
to
follow.
because
if
the
physician
in
his
determination
finds
that
the
fetus
is
viable,
and
here
is
the
offending
language
which
forms
the
basis
now
of
this
appeal,
“or
if
there
is
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
the
fetus
may
be
viable.”
then
the
physician
must
utilize
a
standard
of
care
that
is
an
abortion
method
which
would
provide
for
the
rights
of
the
unborn
child,
so
long
as
another
method
is
not
necessary
to
preserve
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
absolutely
your
honor
and
i
think
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
by
adding
the
words
or
if
there
is
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
the
fetus
may
be
viable,
the
legislature
clearly
intended
to
say
to
physicians
in
this
type
of
practice
in
performing
this
highly
specialized
skill,
that
an
objective
standard
will
be
placed
upon
them
and
that
is
reasonable
medical
certainty.
we
are
not
judging
physicians
in
hindsight
after
an
autopsy
might
show
that,
for
example
the
fetus
might
have
been
have
greater
weight
or
of
longer
gestational
age.
what
we
are
doing
is
saying
to
the
physician,
here
is
an
objective
standard
for
you
to
follow
that
is
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
the
fetus
may
be
viable.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
your
honor
it
is
--
in
a
sense
it
adds
nothing
to
the
concept
of
viability.
it
is
--
it
does
not
intend
and
the
legislature
clearly
did
not
intend
to
add
an
additional
time
period.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
it's
a
semantical
--
if
i
may,
it's
a
semantical
discussion
attempting
as
mr.
justice
marshall
said
in
grayned
versus
rockford,
we're
condemned
to
expressing
ourselves
in
language
and
in
the
hiatus
between
the
law
and
medicine,
we
are
attempting
not
to
carve
out
a
time
period,
but
to
say
semantically,
this
particular
fetus
has
the
statistical
probability
that
medical
science
deals
with
and
not
probability,
statistical
probability
is
one
of
survival.
ms.
carol
los

no,
your
honor.
medical
statistics
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
your
honor,
we
are
dealing
--
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
dictionary
definitions.
we
are
concerned
with
what
our
physicians
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
of
course
your
honor.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
except
that
for
physicians
who
deal
with
this
problem
all
the
time,
statistical
probabilities
is
the
reasonable
medical
certainty
that
they
deal
with.
no
physician
will
say
or
post
it
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
your
honor,
i
don't
wish
to
just
take
out
the
terms
“may
be
viable.”
i
would
like
to
use
the
entire
phrases
the
legislature
did.
if
there
is
sufficient
reason
to
believe,
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
the
fetus
may
be
viable.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
well
certainly
your
honor,
he
is
on
notice
that
an
objective
standard
is
there
and
it
puts
him
on
notice
ahead
of
time.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
your
honor,
what
we
would
be
judging
is
not
so
much
that
initial
determination.
we
are
judging
now
the
standard
of
care
he
should
have
utilized
because
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
it
is
his
determination
with
the
reasonable
degree
of
medical
certainty
based
upon
the
facts
known
to
him
in
judging
whether
or
not
this
fetus
is
viable.
and
we
realized
that
the
whole
medical
terminology
of
the
word
viability
expresses
a
very
fluid
concept,
and
it
expresses
the
certainly
the
potential
capacity
of
the
fetus
to
survive
outside
the
mother's
womb.
what
was
expressed
by
this
court
in
roe
and
doe
and
you
don't
know
if
the
physicians
in
the
lower
court
on
either
side
of
the
issue
disagreed
with
that
definition.
what
they
disagreed
upon
was
the
gestational
age
at
which
that
is
achieved.
and
this
court
in
danforth
and
the
legislature
in
pennsylvania
clearly
chose
not
to
accept
gestational
age.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
yes.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
your
honor,
are
you
saying
is
the
standards
of
a
big
city
hospital
and
a
big
practice
to
be
imposed
on
some
physician
in
a
small
town
who
doesn't
have
available
to
him,
let's
say
a
neonatal
center
or
something
right
available,
of
course
not,
we
are
judging
him
by
what
is
available
to
him.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
clearly,
it
does
your
honor.
it
says
it
judges
him
by
his
own
professional
competence
and
judgment
and
says,
and
if
there
is
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
the
fetus
may
be
viable.
it's
our
position
that
those
words
are
no
less
unclear
to
the
medical
profession,
because
its
--
the
medical
profession
is
not
every
practitioner,
medical
practitioner.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
your
honor,
if
they
have
--
it
is
our
belief
they
will
not
disagree,
that
as
far
as
the
viability
of
this
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
then
i
think
that
there
would
not
be
sufficient
evidence
upon
which
to
convict
in
the
criminal
law.
and
that's
what
the
statute
calls
into
play.
it
doesn't
say,
“well,
if
that
is
the
situation,
then
the
first
degree
murder
charge
will
lie
or
a
manslaughter
will
lie.
it
calls
into
play
the
criminal
statute
and
i
maintain
in
that
situation
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
the
question
is
will
the
prosec
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
has
the
prosecution
proven
its
case
against
the
defendant.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
certainly
your
honor
and
i'm
sure
you
could
probably
get
experts
to
testify
on
any
side
of
any
issue.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
well,
we're
talking
about
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
well,
i'd
certainly
have
to
agree
with
you
your
honor.
i
probably
couldn't
afford
three
experts
as
well.
but
my
point
is
that
we
don't
have
a
battle
of
the
experts
here.
the
experts
agree
that
with
respect
to
viability,
yes,
it's
a
subjective
judgment.
yes,
the
physician
is
being
asked
to
take
statistical
probabilities
and
place
that
whole
matrix
of
medical
research
upon
his
particular
patient.
we
are
looking
at
what
is
known
to
him,
what
is
known
to
the
medical
profession
in
his
community
and
in
his
practice.
we
are
talking
about
a
highly
specialized
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
i
think
that's
probably
an
underlying
question
to
all
of
us.
the
fear
that
maybe
responsible
physicians
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
and
--
yes.
and
i
think
your
honor,
that
that
is
not
the
position
here.
i
think
that
what
a
responsible
physician
will
do
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
i
think
that
could
not
happen
and
the
reason
being
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
i
think
your
honor
with
respect
to
--
now,
the
whole
range
of
the
whole
possibility
of
finding
experts
is
one
whole
distinct
problem.
my
point
is
the
responsible
physician
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
that's
right.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
your
honor,
it's
very
difficult
to
make
that
judgment.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
what
i'm
saying
is,
the
responsible
physician
who
makes
a
good
faith
determination
on
the
medical
evidence
in
front
of
him
with
a
reasonable
degree
of
medical
certainty
will
not
be
in
that
particular
position
of
being
faced
with
the
criminal
law.
what
the
appellees
are
arguing
here
and
especially
with
the
amicus
briefs
are
arguing
is
that
physicians
are
immune
to
the
law.
their
judgments
and
their
judgments
alone
are
to
govern.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
now,
we
--
yes
your
honor.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
this
statute
sends
to
the
criminal
law,
a
determination
based
on
the
particular
facts.
so,
if
in
fact,
the
commonwealth
could
prove
scienter,
and
could
prove
for
example
under
pennsylvania
law,
a
specific
intent
to
kill,
there
may
in
fact
be
a
murder
indictment.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
with
respect
to
the
statute,
certainly
it's
the
objective
standard
based
on
reasonable
medical
certainty.
when
we
call
on
to
play
the
criminal
law,
then
the
criminal
law,
the
commonwealth
in
pennsylvania
will
govern
with
respect
to
each
individual
action.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
it
depends,
your
honor
upon
the
particular
facts
and
what
category
they
fall
into,
whether
it's
homicide
of
the
first
degree
or
murder
of
the
first
degree,
or
third
degree
or
manslaughter.
each
individual
case
must
be
judged
separately
and
that's
what
this
particular
statute
was
designed
to
do.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
it's
willful
and
wanton
misconduct,
gross
misconduct
which
brings
about
the
death.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
that
is
precise
your
honor,
that
is
precise.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
theoretically,
he
might
be.
under
this
statute,
judging
him,
his
professional
competence
and
expertise
and
what
is
known
to
him
about
his
patient
at
that
time,
he
would
not
be
in
any
difficulty
your
honor.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
but
the
real
problem
here
is
that
we
keep
referring
to
the
responsible
physician.
and
in
that
time
period
between
the
invalidation
of
pennsylvania's
original
and
maybe
100-year-old
abortion
statute,
the
invalidation
of
that
and
the
passage
of
this,
the
pennsylvania
legislature
and
the
governor
as
well
held
hearings,
public
hearings
to
determine
the
state
of
medical
arts
and
problems
dealing
with
abortion
in
pennsylvania.
and
one
conclusion
came
to
the
forefront
with
respect
to
abortion
practice;
physicians
were
in
many
respects
creating
a
crisis
with
medical
care
insofar
as
the
woman
patient
is
concerned.
the
same
physicians
bitterly
thought
in
the
court
below
the
requirement
that
they
had
to
test
for
pregnancy
before
they
would
perform
an
abortion.
secondly,
they
also
bitterly
thought
any
regulation
that
would
require
them
to
explain
the
procedure
and
the
complications
to
their
patient
and
one
witness
in
particular
presents
a
rather
dramatic
story.
her
name
is
mary
ellen
gallagher,
she
was
a
news
reporter
for
wcau
tv
in
philadelphia
and
she
post
as
a
teenager
who
fear
that
she
was
pregnant.
she
went
to
numerous
abortion
clinics
and
hospitals
and
spoke
with
doctors
there.
she
absolutely
certifiably
was
not
pregnant.
but
to
a
one
they
put
her
up
on
the
table
and
were
beginning
an
abortion
before
she
stepped
down.
no
pregnancy
testing
for
the
most
part,
no
responsible
medical
care
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
so,
pennsylvania
has
come
to
the
conclusion
--
the
legislature
has
--
that
we
need
legislation
in
this
area
to,
first
of
all,
prior
to
viability
to
protect
maternal
health.
and
now
we're
saying
by
the
position
taken
by
appellees
and
the
amicus
as
far
as
being
immune
from
prosecution
in
this
area,
a
crisis
with
respect
to
the
viable
that
maybe
defective
child.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
yes.
will
men
who
have
to
deal
--
men
and
women
i
should
say,
who
have
to
deal
with
this
problem
on
a
daily
basis
understand
what
is
prescribed
of
them.
and
we
maintain
that
for
the
physicians
who
deal
with
this,
the
responsible
physicians,
they
understand
what
the
terminology
is.
and
i
point
to
the
american
college
of
obgyn
and
their
statement
twice
in
the
last
few
years
with
reference
to
what
they
call
ethical
considerations
in
abortion
practice.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
your
honor,
the
mistake
that
we
are
talking
about
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
the
mistake
--
but,
we're
talking
about
the
criminal
law,
we
have
to
show
scienter
your
honor,
okay.
the
responsible
physician
who
merely
makes
a
mistake,
merely
makes
a
mistake,
based
on
later
in
autopsy
or
material
not
known
to
him
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
well,
i
would
presume
that
decapitation
would
bring
about
death
certainly
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
absolutely,
he
is
judged
by
the
--
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
manslaughter,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
it
falls
right
into
place.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
and
it
calls
him
to
play
the
realm.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
yes
your
honor
but
it
calls
him
to
play
all
of
the
criminal
laws.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
it
doesn't
set
forth
that
this
would
be
manslaughter
with
the
first
degree
of
murder.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
okay.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
if
i've
been
disrespectful
i
certainly
apologize
for
that.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
the
second
provision,
which
requires
the
standard
of
care
physician
might
use
was
not
ruled
upon
by
the
lower
court.
and
although
we
repeatedly
ask
the
court
to
consider
problems
of
severability
and
the
possibility
of
severing,
if
in
fact
they
were
correct
that
it
carves
out
an
additional
time
period
in
which
the
state
has
no
interest
with
--
that's
compelling
in
fetal
life.
we
ask
them
to
sever
the
offending
language
thereby
leaving
intact
all
the
wording
with
respect
to
viable
life.
for
some
reason
the
court
refused
to
do
that
and
on
remand
from
this
court
simply
said,
“we
stand
by
our
prior
position.”
and
we
are
saying
to
this
court
that
if
you
were
not
convinced
that
the
wording
is
correct,
if
we
lose
this
over
poor
choice
of
words
we
are
saying,
remain
intact
the
rest
of
the
statute,
their
correlative
clauses
that
can
be
read
certainly
apart
from
each
other,
that
was
has
been
proposed
here
by
the
appellees.
so,
read
them
in
light
of
the
viable
unborn
child.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
oh,
that
is
correct
your
honor,
absolutely.
and
we
would
grant
that
and
we
say
here
though
physicians
know
what's
prescribed
of
them
and
i
began
to
mention
the
american
college
of
obgyns.
they
recognize
what
they
call
the
duty
and
obligation
of
the
physician
to
what
they
describe
as
the
possibly
viable
fetus.
so
i'm
saying
they
recognize
their
duty
and
obligation.
but
my
concern
here
is
that
we're
going
to
walk
out
of
here
and
lose
this
case
because
of
a
poor
choice
of
words
and
physicians
now
will
fill
themselves
in
the
position
of
being
able
as
the
amicus
are
arguing
and
the
appellees
have
argued
in
the
lower
court
that
is
only
parental
choice
that
governs
when
we're
talking
about
viable
life
or
rather
--
what
i
considered
to
be
a
rather
shocking
statement
that
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
from
the
appellees
brief
says
that
a
fetus
is
not
viable
unless
it
has
meaningful
life.
they're
asking
this
court
to
extend
the
concept,
okay.
so
that
if
through
amniocentesis
and
quite
possibly
a
failure
of
the
original
culture
to
grow
and
testing,
a
couple
finds
themselves
after
viability
to
be
--
soon
to
be
the
parents
of
a
deformed
child
and
they
don't
want
the
child.
they
are
asking
this
court
to
say
that
life
is
not
meaningful,
therefore
the
child
is
not
viable
and
consequently
the
parents
now
have
the
choice
to
destroy
that
child
in
utero.
and
they
said
a
child
doomed
to
lose
all
function
and
become
vegetable
by
the
age
of
three
and
to
die
by
the
age
of
seven
or
eight
is
hardly
capable
of
“meaningful
life”
from
their
discussion
on
viability.
and
with
all
due
respect
to
this
court
i
don't
think
any
of
us
are
in
the
position
to
say
that
life
is
not
meaningful
because
it
suffers
a
handicap.
our
legislature
has
clearly
chosen
to
--
regardless
of
handicap
or
birth
defect
or
race
or
sex
or
whatever,
represent
the
interest
of
the
viable
child
in
utero,
the
viable
child
and
we
are
asking
this
court
to
recognize
that
and
make
a
positive
statement
with
reference
to
the
right
of
the
state
where
it
is
now
chosen
to
represent
the
interest
of
that
viable
but
maybe
defective
unborn
child.
thank
you
your
honor.
ms.
carol
los
mansmann
there
was
a
question
that
underlay
a
great
deal
of
testimony
in
the
lower
court.
that
was
a
fundamental
question
and
that
was,
“what
really
is
an
abortion?”
is
it
the
termination
of
a
woman's
impending
motherhood
or
is
it
that
plus
destruction
of
the
fetus
or
a
viable
child?
and
it
is
our
position
that
with
respect
to
the
methods
applicable,
the
appellees
failed
to
show
that
there
was
not
a
safe
method,
but
their
arguments
are
all
based
on
what
plaintiff,
dr.
john
franklin
said
and
that
is,
that
it's
his
belief
and
he
said,
“i've
thought
about
this
a
great
deal
and
it's
my
belief
that
the
right
to
live
is
that
somebody
wants
you
to
live.”
and
if
the
mother
doesn't
want
you
to
live
then
the
physician
should
be
able
to
perform
an
abortion.
and
he
meant
at
any
time
for
the
purpose
not
just
of
terminating
the
pregnancy
but
destroying
the
fetus
as
well.
and
i
leave
you
with
that
thought
and
ask
you
again
to
recognize
the
state's
interests
in
the
rights
to
the
viable
child.
thank
you.
