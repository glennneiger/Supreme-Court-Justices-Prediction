stewart
but
it
says
after

not
after
likelihood
or
possibility
of
viability?

maybe
it
doesn't
imply
probability,

justice

stewart
but
as
i
read
the
dictionary
and
as
i
understand
the
english
language,
it
doesn't
say
it's
likely
or
being,
it
says
might
be.
justice
potter
stewart
but
we're
dealing
with
the

not
what
