as
a
matter
of
illinois
law,
would
the
state
have
the
power
or
authority
to
give
some
retroactive
relief
for
a
period
prior
to
april
8,
1971?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wenzel
before
you
get
too
far
into
your
argument,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
got
your
entire
answer
to
the
question
i
put
before.
do
i
correctly
summarize
it
by
saying
that
if
someone,
whether
he
got
this
notice
or
not,
who
was
did
not
receive
benefits
during
the
period
prior
to
april
8,
1971
were
now
to
file
some
kind
of
a
claim
in
the
illinois
state
system,
whether
administrative
or
judicial,
we
don't
really
know
whether
the
state
would
pay
him
anything,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
either
result
is
possible
as
far
as
we
know
from
the
record
and
the
law
that
you
may
be
able
to
point
out
what
is
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that
just
like
various
other
claims
that
are
asserted
against
the
state
that
the
claim
maybe
asserted
before
the
court
of
claims
or
whatever
it
is
called,
i
forget,
and
it
may
be
established
and
then
the
legislation
-
the
general
assembly
in
its
wisdom
decides
whether
or
not
to
pay
the
claim.
so
isn't
it
possible
that
twenty
thousand
people
who
did
not
get
the
money
they
should
have
gotten,
could
establish
this
sort
of
claim
and
then
they
might
have
enough
political
influence
to
get
the
legislature
to
adopt
or
pass
a
bill
saying
let's
pay
this
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
really
won't
have
a
chance
to
do
this
unless
they
initiate
the
claim
in
the
first
instance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
court
of
the
appeals
say
that
the
one
thing
they
can't
do
is
order
payment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
there
be
any
objection
if
some
community
organization
decided
to
--
say
you
win
the
case
and
then
some
community
organization
decides
that
well,
these
people,
a
lot
of
these
are
blind,
disabled
elderly
people
who
were
wrongfully
denied
some
money
about
seven
or
eight
years
ago
or
ten,
well,
this
community
organization
decides
they
ought
to
know
what
their
rights
are
and
send
out
precisely
the
same
notice,
would
there
be
any
--
would
that
have
a
different
consequence
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
are
we
really
talking
about
who
pays
for
the
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
my
question
is
some
do
gooder,
some
organization
says
well,
these
people
ought
to
know
what
their
rights
are
and
send
out
a
bulletin
in
the
same
words
as
the
notice
that
court
of
appeals
apparently
thought
was
appropriate,
wouldn't
that
produce
all
the
consequences
that
you
are
concerned
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
do-gooder
could
say
there
has
been
a
federal
decision
that
the
state
of
illinois
wrongfully
denied
you
money
that
you
are
entitled
to
and
that
the
do-gooder
could
tell
all
that
and
in
fact
in
this
court
of
appeals'
notice
need
not
necessarily
recite
that
it
was
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
might
not
be
able
to
benefit
the
entire
class,
just
those
that
don't
know
their
rights
would
just
let
them
fall
by
the
way
side
and
we
just
protect
those
that
are
on
the
surface,
i
see.
