justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
finished
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wondered
if,
what
was
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
this
civil
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
claim
was
based
on
the
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
pursue
my
previous
question
with
you
for
a
moment?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
in
this
complaint
there
had
been
only
the
so-called
statutory
issue,
it
is
the
claim
of
conflict
no
equal
protection
issue.
would
there
have
been
a
jurisdiction
under
1543?
justice
byron
r.
white
because?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
are
wrong
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn’t
--
just
take
my
example,
only
the
statutory
claim,
that
is
in
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
was
there
jury
--
is
there
any.
i
will
ask
you
two
questions.
do
you
think
you
state
a
cause
of
action
if
there
was
only
that,
that
claim
in
the
compliant
and
secondly
if
you
did,
would
there
be
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
--
any
law
as
part
of
1983,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
1983
did
not
reach
and
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
there
be
a
jurisdictional
problem
in
my
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
there
your
cause
of
action
would
be
arising
under
the
social
security
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
if
1983
does
not
reach
all
federal
statutes
and
the
social
security
act
isn't
covered
by
1983
and
you
went
in
under
1331
attempting
to
state
of
cause
of
action,
you
would
have
to
successfully
claim
that
the
social
security
act
gives
a
private
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
there
has
been
no
jurisdiction
issue
raised
in
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose,
we
are
permitted
to
raise
it
on
our
own?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
maybe
properly
in
the
federal
court
on
the
constitutional
issue
that
you
asserted
under
1530
or
1543.
the
question
is
how
about
the
appended
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
still
has
to
be
a
cause
of
action?
i
mean,
for
a
cause
of
action
to
be
appended,
there
has
to
be
a
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
1983
doesn’t
reach
the
social
security
act,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
appended?
