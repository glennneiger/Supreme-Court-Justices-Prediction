well,
both
of
these
propositions
are
propositions
that
maybe,
that
will
only
be
considered
and
maybe
accepted
by
the
state
administrative
agencies,
of
course
ie,
that
there
is
no
administrative
remedy
or
b
if
there
may
have
once
been,
now
congress
is
repealed
the
law,
so
there
now
no
longer
is,
but
that
is
a
matter
for
the
state
courts
to
determine.
that
doesn’t
really
directly
bear
on
the
eleventh
amendment
question
in
this
case,
does
it?
justice

stewart
maybe
the
notice
is
a
vain
thing,
may
be
it's
futility,
but
that
again
doesn’t
directly
bear
on
the
eleventh
amendment?
