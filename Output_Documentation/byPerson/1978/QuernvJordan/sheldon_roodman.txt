mr.
sheldon
roodman
mr.
chief
justices
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
central
question
presented
to
the
court
today
is
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
the
state
of
illinois
maybe
invoked
by
a
state
official
as
a
bar
to
an
order,
requiring
him
to
send
notices
to
members
of
a
duly
certified
class.
this
question
arises
as
one
aspect
of
three
pronged
relief,
granted
by
the
federal
court.
first,
there
has
been
a
declaration
by
the
federal
court
that
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
promulgated
his
own
administrative
regulations
contrary
to
the
social
security
act
and
therefore
void
under
the
supremacy
clause.
second,
in
light
of
this
declaration,
the
federal
court
enjoined
the
future
enforcement
of
these
administrative
regulations.
these
two
aspects
of
the
relief
have
already
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
consistent
with
the
eleventh
amendment.
on
remand,
from
jordan
i,
it
must
be
emphasized,
that
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
were
wholly
in
the
dark
regarding
this
lawsuit.
accordingly,
the
class
representative
in
fulfillment
of
his
fiduciary
obligations
to
the
class,
sought
an
order
requiring
the
petitioner
to
send
notices
to
the
members
of
the
class
merely
explaining;
one,
that
a
federal
suit
had
been
filed
on
their
behalf;
two,
that
they
have
been
denied
certain
aabd
benefits;
three,
that
there
were
preexisting
state
administrative
procedures
for
challenging
the
denial
of
such
benefits
and
four,
the
method
by
which
they
might
trigger
those
procedures.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes
your
honor,
this
was
a
b2
class
on
the
federal
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
correct,
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
therefore
no
notice
is
required
under
the
federal
rules
and
no
notice
had
been
sent
to
these
members
of
the
class.
so,
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jordan
i
they
were
ordered
no
notice,
they
had
never
received
any
notice
during
dependency
of
the
case
of
the
proceeding.
so,
the
notice
that
the
respondents
did
seek
on
their
behalf
merely
advised
them
that
there
had
been
this
lawsuit
pending.
it
advised
them
of
the
declaration
of
the
court
and
then
advised
them
of
pre-existing
administrative
procedures
by
which
they
might
challenge
the
denial
of
those
benefits.
the
seventh
circuit
approved
the
sending
of
such
notices,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
those
notices
in
no
way
predetermined
the
liability
of
the
state
of
illinois.
the
notices
which
were
sent
were
appropriate
both
under
rule
23-d2
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
also
appropriate
as
an
exercise
of
the
general
equitable
discretion
of
the
court.
further,
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
the
federal
courts
have
the
authority
after
entering
a
declaratory
judgment
to
give
further
necessary
and
proper
relief,
these
notices
fall
within
that
section
as
well.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
the
sole
basis
of
their
argument
before
the
court
today.
there
could
be
in
other
cases,
other
equitable
considerations
that
might
compel
a
federal
court
to
decline,
to
send
notices
to
a
class
even
after
finding
a
violation
of
the
social
security
act.
those
are
questions
of
equity,
not
of
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence.
the
only
question
raised
before
the
court
today
is
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
the
state
of
illinois.
we
believe
a
close
examination
of
the
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
and
federalism
embodied
in
the
eleventh
amendment
will
show
that
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
use
the
eleventh
amendment
in
a
way
in
which
it
was
never
intended
and
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
i
will
first
discuss
the
eleventh
amendment
issues
and
then
turn
to
the
1983
issues
presented
in
this
case.
in
jordan
i,
this
court
reaffirmed
the
principle
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
a
federal
court
from
entering
awards
for
money
damages
directly
against
the
state.
this
interpretation
of
the
eleventh
amendment
fell
within
the
historical
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
to
protect
state
treasuries
from
federal
court
orders,
both
to
avoid
a
potential
clash
between
federal
and
state
sovereigns
and
also
to
prevent
a
direct
and
substantial
intrusion
upon
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
by
the
federal
courts,
a
question
of
federalism.
neither
of
these
historical
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
however,
are
in
anyway
jeopardized
by
the
sending
of
the
notices
approved
by
the
seventh
circuit
en
banc.
the
order
challenged
here
by
the
petitioner
does
not
result
in
any
clash
between
the
federal
and
state
sovereigns.
on
the
contrary,
the
order
respects
the
institutions
of
state
government
and
leaves
to
the
institutions
of
state
government,
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
fiscal
liability
of
the
state.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that
order
is
well
would
be
permissible
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
that
order
would
not
displace
the
state
from
determining
its
own
question
of
fiscal
liability
in
accordance
with
state
law
to
the
extent
that
the
order
does
not
intrude
upon
central
decisions
of
the
state
government
that
are
central
to
its
sovereignty.
such
an
order
would
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
imposing
such
a
burden,
that
question
would
be
left
to
the
state.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes
your
honor,
there
is
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
violated
the
federal
rights
of
the
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
is
central.
there
is
a
weighing
of
the
federal
interest
in
this
case
with
the
state
interest.
we
have
as
a
central
finding
in
this
case,
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause,
a
knowing
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause,
plus
there
are
federal
interests
at
stake
in
this
case.
what
the
federal
court
here
has
done
has
accommodated
and
harmonized
the
federal
interests
with
the
state
interests.
it
has
done
so
in
a
way
that
is
not
intrusive
upon
the
state
government.
it
leaves
to
the
state
government
that
a
final
determination
of
fiscal
matters
that
are
central
to
state
government.
the
direct,
excuse
me
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
the
original
jurisdictional
base
for
the
lawsuit
is
section
13.43.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
the
original
claim
was
based
both
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause.
the
federal
court
never
reached
the
equal
protection
clause.
they
relied
solely
upon
the
social
security
act
and
supremacy
clause.
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
in
fact
the
petitioner,
a
state
officer
is
not
here
seeking
to
protect
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
illinois.
what
he
seeks
to
do
is
block
access
by
the
respondents
to
the
state
created
remedies.
the
state,
the
sovereign
state
of
illinois,
(a)
agreed
to
provide
administrative
remedies
for
all
public
aid
recipients
who
wish
to
challenge
the
denial
of
benefits.
that
requirement
was
part
of
the
social
security
act,
but
the
state
of
illinois
went
even
one
step
further.
they
provide
for
judicial
review
of
the
administrative
decisions
of
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid.
so
the
very
procedures
and
remedies
that
the
sovereign
state
has
adopted
for
members
of
the
plaintiff
class,
the
director
here
seeks
to
prevent
them
from
utilizing.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
for
assuming
that
the
interests
of
the
sovereign
state
of
illinois
are
aligned
with
the
interests
of
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid.
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
originally
violated
the
social
security
act.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
does
represent
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
before
this
court.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well
that
is
the
--
your
honor,
that
is
the
sole
person
before
the
court
today
i
think.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
we
were
maintaining
your
honor
that
his
interests
and
the
interests
of
the
sovereign
state
of
illinois
are
not
necessarily
aligned.
the
sovereign
state
through
its
legislature
has
adopted
explicit
remedies
for
the
respondents
in
this
case
to
challenge
denial
of
benefits.
the
director
on
the
other
hand
is
a
state
officer.
it
is
not
true
that
in
all
cases,
a
state
officer
has
the
identical
interests
of
the
sovereign,
particularly
when
a
state
officer
is
responsible
for
the
initial
violation
of
law.
we
think
in
cases
of
this
kind,
the
state
officer
is
seeking
to
block
the
respondents
from
utilizing
procedures
of
the
state
through
its
legislature
has
expressly
adopted.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
no
the
question
is
whether
the
state
officer
should
be
permitted
to
invoke
the
immunity
of
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
no.
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
in
representing
the
state
officer
here,
we
think
should
not
be
permitted
to
invoke
the
immunity
of
the
state
of
illinois
except
in
those
cases
in
which
there
is
a
direct
and
substantial
intrusion
upon
state
government.
this
court
held
in
jordan
i
that
money
damages
against
the
state
are
a
direct
intrusion
upon
the
state
and
therefore
it
is
appropriate
for
the
state
officer
to
be
able
to
invoke
the
immunity
of
the
state
of
illinois.
in
the
tax
cases
of
1940s,
which
were
claims
for
money
judgments
against
the
state,
once
again,
a
state
officer
could
claim
the
immunity
of
the
state.
however,
in
those
cases
in
which
if
there
are
no
cases
other
than
money
damages
cases
in
which
a
state
officer
has
been
permitted
to
claim
the
immunity
of
the
state
of
illinois
or
any
other
state
in
this
nation,
the
notice
relief
here,
we
submit,
does
not
create
a
clash
between
the
sovereign
state
of
illinois
and
the
national
government
through
its
federal
courts.
instead,
the
notice
remedy
is
a
carefully
tailored
remedy,
which
is
designed
to
avoid
such
a
clash.
the
remedy
by
sending
the
members
of
the
class
back
to
the
state
institutions
avoids
any
clash
between
the
sovereigns.
ultimately,
the
question
of
whether
they
shall
recover
the
benefits
that
have
been
denied
them
is
a
question
for
the
state
government
to
decide
through
its
administrative
agencies
and
through
its
judicial
branch.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
money
judgments,
your
honor,
are
judgments
that
have
a
direct
monetary
impact
upon
the
state
for
a
past
conduct.
this
court
did
hold
and
say
that
the
equitable
restitution
was
indistinguishable
for
money
damages
that
have
been
barred
previously
or
money
judgments
for
the
recovery
on
bonds
or
the
tax
cases
in
which
a
person
sought
to
recover
taxes
that
they
claim
had
been
illegally
exacted
from
them.
in
the
absence
of
a
money
judgment
and
with
the
particular
notices
that
have
been
ordered
here,
there
can
be
no
problems
of
enforcement
that
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
cases
involving
money
judgments.
the
enforcement
is
solely
against
a
state
officer.
if
in
fact
the
plaintiff's
do
not
recover
in
this
case,
the
state
officer
is
not
in
contempt
of
the
federal
court.
the
only
requirement
on
the
state
officer
is
to
send
the
notices.
after
that
the
questions
of
liability
are
reserved
to
the
state
government.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well
i
would
assume
if
the
state
courts
decide
that
they
should
pay
that
the
state
officer
would
respect
the
judgments
of
the
state.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
the
eleventh
amendment
would
not
apply
in
the
state
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
our
only
remedy
your
honor
would
be
for
within
the
state
court
system,
we
might
pursue
the
remedies
of
contempt
within
the
state
court
system.
he
would
not
be
in
violation
of
the
federal
court
order
and
we
would
have
no
remedy
of
contempt
in
federal
court
and
no
potential
clash
between
the
state
sovereign
and
the
federal
sovereign.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
those
cases
did
involve
collection
on
bonds.
those
cases
didn’t
were
intended
specifically
to
recover
the
principal
--
payment
of
principal
and
interest
on
bonds.
they
did
involve
money
judgment.
those
cases
fell
within
the
historical
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
original
case
of
chisholm
versus
georgia
in
which
there
was
a
suit
for
the
collection
of
money.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
the
question,
your
honor,
we
think
would
turn
on
principles
of
federalism.
it
would
be
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
court
order
was
so
intrusive
upon
the
state
sovereign
that
it
should
not
stand
within
our
federal
system.
that
we
think
is
the
basis
--
the
balancing
test
that
the
federal
court
would
have
to
apply
in
that
situation.
the
question
is
throughout
though
--
almost
two
hundred
years
of
the
eleventh
amendment
has
always
been
whether
the
particular
relief
is
consistent
with
this
nation’s
federalism.
and
federalism
requires
a
sensitivity
to
both
the
state
interest
and
the
national
interest.
in
this
case,
in
the
absence
of
such
relief
as
approved
by
the
seventh
circuit
en
banc,
the
federal
court
will
be
ignoring
and
condoning
the
violation
of
the
federal
rights
of
the
plaintiff
class.
in
our
federal
system,
the
violation
of
federal
rights
cannot
go
un-redressed.
what
the
lower
courts
have
done
here
is
to
tailor
a
remedy
that
is
sensitive
to
those
federal
rights
and
to
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
while
at
the
same
time
recognizing
the
interest
of
--
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
government
and
not
intruding
upon
the
institutions
of
state
government.
by
leaving
to
the
state
government,
the
ultimate
determination
of
liability,
the
federal
court
here
has
harmonized
the
interests
of
the
federal
government,
the
federal
funds
that
are
at
stake
in
the
aabd
program,
the
federal
rights
that
are
involved
in
the
social
security
act
and
of
course,
the
federal
interests
involved
in
seeing
that
the
supremacy
clause
is
adhered
to.
the
federal
interests
in
this
case
are
quite
different
from
those
in
the
tax
cases
of
the
1940’s
and
the
bond
cases
in
the
later
part
of
the
nineteenth
century.
in
those
cases,
it
was
not,
there
was
no
program
that
was
based
upon
co-operative
federalism.
there
were
no
federal
interests
involved
directly
in
those
cases.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
there
is
certainly
is
a
federal
interest
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
question
then
could
be
raised
and
presented
through
the
state
court
system
and
ultimately
considered
by
this
court.
and
what
we
seek
here
is
no
more
than
in
that
case,
we
seek
to
have
the
issues
of
liability
referred
back
to
the
state
court
system
and
then
determine
within
the
context
of
state
law
in
the
federalism
--
in
the
state
court
system.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
i
certainly
would
agree,
your
honor.
the
point
was
that
in
this
case
there
has
been
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
federal
law
that
this
court
has
upheld.
so,
there
because
of
the
free-prong
nature
of
the
relief,
there
is
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
federal
law
whereas
in
the
tax
cases
the
entire
matter
is
referred
in
ab
initio
to
the
state
court
system
for
consideration.
the
petitioner
here
does
not
explain
how
the
notice
relief
in
any
way
undermines
federalism.
further,
the
petitioner
cites
no
cases
in
support
of
his
position.
the
petitioner
seems
to
suggest
that
the
state
is
the
real
party
in
interest
and
that
the
notices
will
be
a
burden
upon
his
office.
however,
it
is
important
to
distinguish
between
equitable
considerations
and
the
eleventh
amendment
considerations.
if
the
class
here
involved
only
500
persons,
that
is
a
question
in
comparison
to
the
equities
of
the
case.
it
is
a
question
that
this
court
would
weigh
in
the
balance
in
deciding
whether
to
send
notices,
but
the
eleventh
amendment
community
of
the
state
does
not
turn
on
the
question
of
the
number
of
persons
in
the
class.
what
is
important
here
is
for
the
--
is
for
the
federal
courts
to
provide
a
remedy
that
is
co-extensive
with
the
violation.
unless
the
federal
remedy
here
of
notices
to
the
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
is
approved
then
those
persons
who
are
actually
harmed
by
the
violation
of
law
would
seek
--
would
receive
no
redress
whatsoever.
the
petitioner
further
argues
that
the
respondents
are
seeking
to
accomplish
by
indirection
what
jordan
wanted
barred
directly.
it
is
not
true
that
this
court
held
in
jordan
i
that
the
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
were
to
be
barred
from
recovering.
what
this
court
held
only
was
that
the
federal
court
could
not
order
such
recovery
and
therefore
the
decision
by
the
federal
court
en
banc
is
consistent
with
the
original
decision
in
jordan
i.
finally,
it
is
important
to
take
into
account
also
the
principles
of
federalism
embodied
in
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
now
codified
as
1983.
in
enacting
that
provision,
congress
clearly
intended
to
provide
an
effective
federal
remedy
for
infringement
of
federal
rights
by
state
officers,
just
as
occurred
in
this
case.
in
doing
so,
congress
recognized
that
the
federal
courts
would
be
(1)
overriding
certain
state
laws;
(2)
providing
a
federal
remedy
where
state
law
was
inadequate
and
(3)
providing
a
federal
remedy
where
the
state
remedy
though
adequate
in
theory
was
not
available
in
practice
and
that
is
precisely
the
situation
we
have
today.
a
state
remedy
that
is
available
in
theory,
but
not
in
practice,
it
is
a
state
remedy
that
is
only
triggered
by
the
sending
of
a
notice
and
unless
the
members
of
the
plaintiff
clause
have
such
notice
they
would
be
unable
to
utilize
those
procedures.
thus
it
is
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress
in
1983
to
provide
for
the
sending
of
notices
to
these
individuals.
for
the
state
officer
here,
to
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress
there
is
a
heavy
burden.
the
state
officer
must
be
able
to
show
that
the
remedy
appropriate
under
1983
is
a
direct
intrusion
upon
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
showing,
the
argument
that
the
1983
remedy
should
be
frustrated
must
fail.
in
conclusion
then,
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
en
banc,
to
hold
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
an
order
merely
requiring
a
state
official
to
send
notices
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
historical
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
our
federalism
and
would
be
inconsistent
with
congressional
mandate
embodied
in
1983.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes
sir.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
we
believe
there
would
be
this
question
is
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
because
the
supremacy
clause
is
an
integral
part
of
the
constitution.
violation
of
the
social
security
act
is
in
fact
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
and
therefore
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
if
we
are
wrong
on
that
question
that
would
not
disturb
in
anyway
the
court's
affirmance
of
the
order
of
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
excuse
me,
you
mean
jurisdictionally?
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes,
your
honor,
to
both
the
questions.
this
court
in
fact
and
jordan
expressly
held
that
1983
was
an
appropriate
cause
of
action
for
enforcing
the
social
security
act.
we
would
find
jurisdiction
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes
your
honor,
there
is
a
dual,
both
under
the
constitutional
language
of
1983
as
well
as
the
and
laws.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
we
would
have
jurisdiction
under
1331.
this
is
a
question
of
rising
under
the
constitution.
we
would
claim
that
in
this
case
there
is
an
excess
of
$10,000.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
if
we
were
then
to
claim
that
the
cause
of
action
for
the
violation
of
the
social
security
act
was
not
a
question
also
under
1331?
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
we
would
have
to.
your
honor,
in
addition
there
is
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
we
would
have
which
provides
a
cause
of
action
and
we
would
seek
equitable
relief
under
first
the
declaratory
judgment
that
the
acts
of
state
officer
were
contrary
to
federal
law
and
the
supremacy
clause
and
pursuant
to
that
declaration,
we
would
seek
equitable
relief
to
enjoin
the
future
violations
of
the
social
security
act.
so,
we
would
have
no
remedy
adequate
at
law.
the
plaintiff’s
would
be
suffering
irreparable
injury
and
therefore
we
would
meet
the
tests
under
equitable
jurisdiction
under
normal
equitable
principles
to
secure
an
injunction
against
the
acts
of
state
officers
in
violation
–
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
here
is
clear.
it's
already
been
upheld
in
jordan
i.
we
are
clearly
properly
in
federal
court.
it
is
conceivable
that
in
other
cases
now
pending
before
the
court,
houston
will
offer
rights
on
it.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
your
honor
after
seven
years
of
this
litigation,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
exercise
that
pendent
jurisdiction.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes,
i
did.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
precisely,
that
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
if
1983
would
be
the
proper
cause
of
action
for
the
constitutional
claim,
we
would
have
a
pendent
claim
under
that
declaratory
judgment
act
and
under
general
equitable
principles
for
what
your
denominating
as
solely
the
statutory
claim.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes
it
is
–
mr.
sheldon
roodman
precisely.
thank
you.
