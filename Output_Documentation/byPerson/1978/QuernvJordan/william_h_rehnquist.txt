justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
of
a
case
do
you
think
we
still
have
here
in
view
of
the
majority
of
the
en
banc
seventh
circuit's
opinion,
which
on
the
state's
appeal,
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
but
said
if
the
district
court
was
so
inclined,
it
could
enter
a
more
modest
decree?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
district,
the
court
of
seventh
circuit
as
i
read
its
opinion,
left
that
completely
up
to
the
state
courts
to
determine.
it
doesn't
say
the
state
courts
have
to
award
retroactive
relief.
it
just
says
that
this
class
of
people
may
be
told
that
they
may
have
a
claim
in
the
state
courts
and
remits
them
to
the
state
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
understand
why
you
would
say
that
about
the
district
court's
order
in
this
case,
but
the
seventh
circuit
majority
rather
substantially
modified
it,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
by
virtue
of
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
if
the
majority
of
the
seventh
circuit
felt
the
way
you
think
it
felt,
it
would
simply
would
have
affirmed
judge
will's
order
rather
than
reversed
it.
i
can
see
why
you
could
say
that
about
judge
wills'
order,
but
i
have
some
difficulty
with
your
interpretation
of
judge
wood's
opinion
in
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roodman,
class
action
procedures
have
come
into
play
largely
since
i
left
the
private
practice.
is
that
ordinary
that
as
you
say
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
would
be
largely
in
the
dark
after
a
remand
from
this
court
in
edelman,
after
decision
on
the
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
injunctive
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
now
about
an
affirmative
basis
for
the
district
court's
authority
to
act.
your
opponents
contend
that
whatever
that
affirmative
authority
might
support
in
other
cases,
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
it
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
order
had
provided
in
addition
to
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
it
could
provide
that
can't
--
although
illinois
law
did
not
provide
for
any
hearing
in
this
situation,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitution
law
under
the
goldberg
versus
kelly
line
of
cases,
a
hearing
was
mandated
by
the
constitution
and
therefore
regardless
of
illinois
law,
the
illinois
state
system
would
have
to
give
hearings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
it
would
be
imposing
a
rather
substantial
aspect
of
retrospect
of
relief,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
that
the
state
would
be
required
to
hold
a
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
original
district
court
decree
in
this
case
didn't
speak
in
terms
of
damage,
did
it?
it
spoke
in
terms
of
equitable
restitution,
suggesting
that
you
know,
it
wasn't
quiet
as
air-tight
as
an
award
of
damages.
so,
are
you
correct
in
saying
that
it's
just
strictly
and
only
damages
that
is
forbidden
by
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roodman,
what
you
do
with
cases
like
in
re
ayers
and
hagood
against
southern
that
was
cited
in
edelman
against
jordan,
where
the
court
refused
to
permit
suit
in
federal
court
for
specific
performance
of
a
contract
which
i
take
it
could
well
not
have
involved
monetary
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
allow
--
would
you
think
the
eleventh
amendment
allowed
a
district
court
in
a
case
such
as
this
to
order
a
state
official
to
specifically
perform
a
contract
in
which
the
state
had
engaged
so
long
as
it
did
not
involve
actual
payment
of
money,
supposedly
to
involve
furnishing
of
supplies
to
a
group
of
people?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
roodman,
in
the
tax
cases
wasnâ€™t
the
claim
of
ford
motor
company
for
example
that
the
tax
violated
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
was
not
of
federal
interest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
was
puzzled
by
your
statement
that
there
were
no
federal
interests
about
the
same
magnitude
involved
in
the
tax
cases
in
the
40s
as
they
were
in
this
case.
i
would
think
the
federal
court
set
to
vindicate
the
fourteenth
amendment
quiet
as
much
as
they
do
to
the
supremacy
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
also
allege
a
constitutional
violation
in
your
compliant,
so
that
you
would
we
presume
we
have
an
argument
for
pendent
jurisdiction
under
hagans
against
lavine?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
quern
against
jordan
which
is
a
sequel
to
edelman
against
jordan
which
we
decided
five
terms
ago,
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
sitting
in
chicago
after
our
remand
in
the
edelman
case
ordered
state
officials
to
send
to
each
member
of
the
plaintiff,
class,
and
notice
informing
them
that
he
had
been
denied
public
assistance
to
which
he
was
entitled.
the
state
appealed
this
decision
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
court
sitting
en
banc
reversed
the
district
court's
order
on
the
ground
that
that
form
of
notice
was
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
because
it
purported
to
decide
that
illinois
public
funds
should
be
used
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
the
plaintiffs
without
the
consent
of
the
state.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
on
the
remand,
the
district
court
could
order
the
state
officials
to
send
an
explanatory
notice
as
that
court
put
it
to
plaintiff
class
members
advising
them
that
there
is
a
state
administrative
procedure
available
if
they
wish
to
have
the
state
determine
whether
or
not
they
may
be
eligible
for
past
benefits.
and
today
we
affirm
that
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
we
first
reject
respondent's
suggestion
that
our
decision
in
edelman
has
been
eviscerated
by
later
decisions.
none
of
the
later
decisions
relied
upon,
justifies
a
conclusion
different
from
that
which
we
reached
in
edelman.
section
1983
does
not
explicitly
and
by
clear
language
indicate
on
its
face
an
intent
to
sweep
away
the
traditional
immunity
of
the
states
nor
does
it
have
a
legislative
history
that
focuses
directly
on
the
question
of
state
liability
or
shows
that
congress
considered
and
decided
to
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
the
states.
we
therefore
conclude
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
the
general
language
of
section
1983
to
override
that
immunity.
turning
to
the
question
whether
the
proposed
notice
of
the
court
of
appeals
violates
the
eleventh
amendment,
we
find
that
the
notice
is
ancillary
to
prospective
relief
which
is
permissible
under
the
decision
in
ex
parte
young
and
edelman
and
not
a
retroactive
award
that
requires
payment
of
funds
from
the
state
treasury
which
we
held
was
invalid
under
the
eleventh
amendment
in
edelman.
