seriously
if
a
private
association

it
as
they

when

well,
should
we

to

the
views
in

state
of
illinois.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
and
i
understand
your
prior
statement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
you,
to
say
there

nothing
to
indicate
or
that
the
director
is
speaking
for
the
sovereign
state
of
illinois.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
resolve
this
potential
conflict
that
you
are
implying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
decide
what
is
good
for
what
the
state
of
illinois
thinks
about
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
the
attorney
general
invoke
the
immunity?
chief
justice

e.
burger
now
what
if
the
state's
executive
branch
pursuant
to
your
suggestion,
decides
not
to
pay,
then
what?
then
they
go
on
to
the
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
if
the
state
court
decides
they
should
pay,
then
what
happens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
attorney
general
says
that
the
purposes
of
illustration
that
violates
the
eleventh
amendment
and
our
holdings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
why
i
posed
it,
what
if
he
asserted
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
conversely,
if
the
state
courts
in
that
hypothetical
decide
no
entitlement
that's
the
end
of
it,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
if
you
have
anything
further
mr.
