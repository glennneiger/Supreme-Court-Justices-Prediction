justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
decide
the
case
--
i
mean,
like
the
star
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
general
gorton,
i
have
a
little
problem
with
“by
the
people.”
could
the
legislature
amend
the
constitution?
no.
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
isn't
that
ways,
i
mean
“by
the
people,“
it
doesn't
mean
not
the
legislature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
it
say
it
could
be
by
the
legislature?
why
did
it
say
“by
the
people”
and
the
congress?
why
couldn't
it
have
said
the
legislature
and
congress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
where
a
document
--
a
legislative
document
tells
about
one
legislative
body,
congress.
and
then
says
the
people
--
i'm
talking
about
the
other
group
--
could
may
--
if
they'd
meant
the
legislature,
wouldn't
they
have
said
the
legislature
of
washington
and
the
legislature
of
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
the
enable
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
say
in
this
instance,
cong
--
the
legislature
of
washington
can
in
effect
amend
the
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
what
are
you
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
people
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
say
that
in
washington,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
has
said
that
the
state
can
speak
through
its
people
through
the
legislature.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
--
well,
so
then
the
state
of
washington
says
that
any
provision
for
the
protection
of
indians
in
the
constitution
can
be
amended
by
congress
--
by
the
legislature.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
we
are
bound
by
the
state
of
washington's
interpretation
on
what
is
meant
“by
the
people.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
can
congress
tell
the
state
of
washington
how
it
may
and
may
not
amend
its
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
can,
does
not
(voice
overlap)
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
know
it's
a
(inaudible).
can
congress
say
that
if
indians
are
involved,
a
state
cannot
amend
its
constitution
by
the
legislature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
different
from
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
have
to
find
a
difference,
the
rule
with
you?
