mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
yakima
reservation
is
an
extensive
tract
of
land
in
central
washington
of
more
than
2,000
square
miles,
almost
the
size
of
the
state
of
delaware.
four-fifths
of
that
land
is
held
in
trust
or
restricted
status
by
the
united
states
for
the
benefit
of
the
yakima
nation.
the
other
one-fifth
has
been
removed
from
trust
status
and
sold
almost
entirely
to
non-indians.
most
of
the
fee
land
is
located
in
the
northeastern
portion
of
the
reservation;
it
is
shown
in
gray
on
the
map,
which
is
exhibit
34
in
the
record.
the
population
of
the
reservation
was
stipulated
in
the
pre-trial
order
in
this
case
to
be
about
25,000
of
which
3,000
were
members
of
the
tribe.
since
the
date
of
that
pre-trial
order,
the
members
of
both
groups
have
increased.
indians
and
non-indians
live
together
on
most
of
the
inhabited
portions
of
the
reservation
but
most
of
the
non-indians
live
on
fee
lands
near
the
yakima
river.
the
indian
population
is
scattered
more
evenly
throughout
the
non-forested
portions
of
the
reservation.
two
small
cities,
toppenish
and
wapato,
are
located
entirely
inside
the
reservation
borders.
each
of
those
cities
has
an
indian
population
of
slightly
less
than
10%
and
each
of
them
is
located
almost
exclusively
on
fee
land.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
some
of
the
non
fee
land
has
been
--
is
in
agricultural
use
and
has
been
leased
to
non-indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
tribe
or
the
united
states,
yes.
in
addition
to
city
police
officers
in
toppenish
and
wapato,
the
law
enforcement
system
includes
about
40
deputy
sheriffs
almost
twice
the
number
who
run
the
force
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
a
considerable
tribal
police
force
and
the
state
patrol
detachment
with
headquarters
at
toppenish.
the
under-sheriff
of
the
county
is
a
member
of
the
yakima
tribe.
working
relationships
among
those
agencies
are
extremely
close.
all
deputy
sheriffs
and
all
state
patrolmen
are
crossed
deputized
by
the
tribe.
all
tribal
police
are
crossed
deputized
by
the
sheriff
with
authority
for
arrests
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
and
many
of
the
officers
of
each
carry
federal
commissions
from
the
bia
as
well.
that's
the
bugaboo
of
checkerboarding
and
the
use
of
tract
books
which
is
a
constant
refrain
of
the
tribe
and
the
solicitor
general
is
therefore
just
that,
a
bugaboo.
and
several
of
the
sheriff's
deputies
testified
almost
any
general
law
enforcement
officer
can
make
an
arrest
anywhere
on
the
reservation
for
any
criminal
offense,
whether
the
offense
is
to
be
tried
by
a
tribal
court,
a
state
court,
or
a
federal
district
court
is
decided
later
by
lawyers.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
it
does.
mr.
slade
gorton
although
the
misdemeanor
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
arresting
officer
in
at
least
99%
of
all
cases
is
not
going
to
need
to
know
three
sets
of
laws
at
all.
generally
speaking,
wife
beating
or
a
traffic
offense
is
going
to
be
an
offense
against
each
of
the
two.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
does
depend
on
what
law
is
applicable,
whether
there
has
been
a
crime.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
do
not
believe
that
there
has
been.
obviously,
by
far
the
fewest
offenses
would
be
offenses
of
federal
or
criminal
code
offenses
because
those
are
only
the
major
crimes.
the
largest
number
of
offenses
would
presumably
be
state
offenses
because
its
jurisdiction
is
the
broadest.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
tribal
offenses
of
course
are
limited
to
minor
crimes
with
the
penalty
of
not
more
than
six
months
in
jail.
mr.
slade
gorton
would
be
a
state
violation
but
very
likely
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
slade
gorton
and
the
tribal
code,
yes
and
so
the
deputy
sheriff
can
arrest
and
if
it
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
code,
if
the
lawyers
will
decide
that
that's
where
the
offender
goes.
if
it's
under
the
state
code,
the
offender
will
go
to
a
county
jail
and
be
tried
on
the
county
superior
court
or
district
court.
yakima
county
however
thus
has
some
difficulty
in
making
arrests
on
much
of
the
trust
land
because
the
portion
of
the
reservation
west
of
a
line
roughly
like
that
is
closed
by
tribal
action
to
non-indians.
perhaps
it
goes
without
saying
that
this
is
not
a
racial
discrimination
case.
the
trial
court
found
no
discrimination
against
indians
and
the
states
program
of
law
enforcement.
a
judgment,
which
had
based
in
part
on
the
explicit
testimony,
is
to
the
absence
of
such
discrimination
from
the
chief
of
the
tribal
police
force
himself.
the
complaints
of
the
yakima's
about
inadequate
law
enforcement
protection
are
identical
to
those
of
non-indians
in
yakima
and
throughout
the
nation.
there
is
not
enough
of
it.
why
is
there
never
a
police
officer
around
when
we
really
need
one?
as
the
court
is
aware,
we
do
not
regard
the
order
noting
probable
jurisdiction
as
encompassing
the
assertion
of
the
tribe
and
the
solicitor
general
but
washington
was
required
to
amend
it's
constitution
in
order
to
assume
jurisdiction
under
public
law
280.
your
honor
admits
--
omits
that
question
of
course
for
the
very
good
reason
that
you
made
it
in
our
favor
on
three
occasions,
in
makah,
in
tonasket,
and
in
comenout.
nevertheless,
that
disclaimer
caused
argument
represents
the
principal
submission
of
our
opponents
occupying
some
60%
of
the
162
pages
of
argument
in
their
three
briefs.
our
reply
brief
for
this
reason
demonstrates
that
your
three
decisions
on
the
subject
were
correct.
even
before
one
reaches
the
argument
however
that
the
enabling
act
in
our
state
constitution
still
prohibit
our
assumption
of
jurisdiction,
one
must
first
decide
just
what
lands
are
covered
geographically
by
the
disclaimer
clause
language,
as
well
as
what
types
of
governmental
power
or
jurisdiction
the
state
was
mandated
to
disclaim
in
1889.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
missed
that.
we
re-filed
the
correction
changing
the
w
to
a
t.
mr.
slade
gorton
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
under
the
enabling
act
language
in
our
state
constitution,
washington
disclaims,
and
i
quote,
“all
right
and
title
to
all
lands
owned
or
held
by
any
indian
or
indian
tribes
and
until
the
title
thereto
shall
have
been
extinguished
by
the
united
states,
said
indian
lands
shall
remain
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.”
the
united
states
title
to
fee
lands
on
the
reservation
has
been
so
extinguished.
the
disclaimer
clause
is
--
does
not
--
applicable
to
those
fee
lands.
and
even
the
tribe
and
the
solicitor
general
concede
that
washington
has
acted
to
assume
full
jurisdiction
over
fee
lands.
fee
lands
are
therefore
are
not
covered
by
the
disclaimer
clause
or
by
a
debate
over
the
existence
or
validity
of
partial
jurisdiction.
next,
what
substantive
forms
of
jurisdiction
are
covered
by
the
disclaimer
clause?
in
an
1896
decision,
draper
almost
contemporaneous
with
our
enabling
act,
this
court
held
that
enabling
act
disclaimers
do
not
encompass
the
type
of
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
envisaged
by
public
law
280
at
all.
draper
arose
in
montana
which
shares
the
same
enabling
act
with
washington.
these
arguments
are
of
course
academic
because
your
three
previous
decisions
on
the
method
chosen
by
washington
to
assume
jurisdiction
under
public
law
280
were
correct.
this
is
not
to
say
that
we
entirely
disagree
with
a
basic
premise
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case.
we
agree
with
him
that
the
congress
could
have
required
a
popular
referendum
as
a
prerequisite
to
assumption
of
jurisdiction
by
an
enabling
act
state
or
for
that
matter,
by
any
other
state,
if
it
had
wished
to
do
so
on
1953.
we
also
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
congressman
westland
and
others
involved
in
the
drafting
of
public
law
280
assumed
that
washington
would
be
required
to
amend
it's
constitution
in
order
to
assume
jurisdiction.
but
we
disagree
that
those
two
facts
lead
to
the
conclusion
advanced
by
the
solicitor
general
on
the
tribe.
they
contended
that
congress
added
to
a
law
designed
to
facilitate
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
by
the
states,
an
independent
federal
requirement
that
a
handful
of
those
states
do
so
only
by
a
popular
referendum.
that
haphazard
requirement
applies
under
their
theory
only
to
eight
states
in
the
entire
nation
but
was
to
apply
to
them
even
though
no
such
requirement
existed
under
state
law.
that
theory
is
consistent
neither
with
the
goal
of
congress
in
1953,
nor
with
what
it
actually
said
in
public
law
280.
congress'
goal
in
1953
was
to
have
the
states
assume
jurisdiction
over
indian
reservations.
in
the
words
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case,
that
goal
was,
and
i
quote,
“to
pull
down
the
reservation
fences
that
kept
out
state
law.”
we
agree.
congress
passed
public
law
280
to
enable
the
states
to
pull
those
fences
down
by
removing
every
federal
impediment,
not
to
build
new
fences.
in
fact,
some
states
were
required
to
assume
jurisdiction
without
either
legislative
or
popular
approval.
some
other
states
had
constitutional
amendments
tied
to
their
enabling
acts.
those
enabling
act
impediments
were
removed
and
the
congress
authorized
the
amendment
of
those
state
constitutions
to
which
they
were
tied
with
two
important
words
as
a
qualification,
and
i
quote,
“where
necessary”.
obviously,
that
phrase
“where
necessary”
implies
that
in
some
enabling
act
states,
a
constitutional
amendment
was
not
necessary.
the
phrase
is
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
contention
that
the
congress
intended
to
add
the
requirement
of
a
constitutional
amendment
as
a
federal
requirement
even
when
no
such
requirement
existed
under
state
law.
in
fact,
the
counsel
for
the
subcommittee
which
drafted
public
law
280
explained
that
that
section
6
granted
states
permission
to
amend
their
statutes
or
constitutions
where
state
courts
deemed
to
such
permission
to
be
necessary.
still,
other
states,
those
in
which
neither
a
constitutional
nor
a
statutory
amendment
was
necessary
were
required
to
take
affirmative
legislative
action
not
including
a
popular
referendum
to
show
their
willingness
to
assume
the
burden
of
law
enforcement
on
indian
reservations.
but
the
congressional
purpose
was
consistent
throughout
all
three
categories
of
states,
to
encourage
state
assumptions,
to
remove
impediments
and
road
blocks,
but
not
to
create
them.
in
1959,
the
washington
supreme
court
decided
that
no
constitutional
amendment
was
necessary
and
has
repeated
that
conclusion
on
at
least
three
more
occasions.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
in
the
quinault
case.
mr.
slade
gorton
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
it
dealt
directly
with
it
and
found
that
it
was
--
that
the
legislative
history
of
public
law
280
together
with
its
precise
language
and
with
the
“where
necessary
clause”
made
it
strictly
a
state
law
question.
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly
and
i'm
coming
to
that
at
my
next
point.
the
state
court's
rationale
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
1957,
the
state
legislature
passed
a
statute
binding
and
obligating
itself
to
take
jurisdiction
on
any
reservation
from
which
there
was
a
tribal
request.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
half
of
his
argument
does.
his
argument
that
we
were
required
to
amend
our
constitution
of
course
does.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
states
court's
rationale,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
that
though
it
is
technically
--
though
it's
technically
irrelevant
here,
is
that
the
people
of
washington
speak
through
their
legislature
just
as
the
people
of
the
united
states
speak
through
the
congress.
our
constitution,
article
xxvi
has
not
been
repealed
but
the
disclaimer
portion
has
been
rendered
ineffective,
just
as
the
congress
rendered
ineffective
the
enabling
act
provision
on
disclaimer
without
repealing
it
or
even
amending
it
in
expressed
terms.
this
is
just
what
congress
seems
to
have
had
in
mind
back
at
1889
when
it
passed
a
single
enabling
act
for
washington,
montana,
and
south
dakota.
south
dakota's
equivalent
to
our
article
xxvi
states
that
the
consent
of
its
people
is
to
be
“expressed
by
its
legislative
assembly.”
although
a
long
portion
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
is
designed
to
show
that
congress
meant
that
this
amendment
act
changes
would
have
to
be
made
by
a
popular
referendum.
but
the
president
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
slade
gorton
his
argument
--
no.
his
argument
--
the
solicitor
general's
argument
based
on
extensive
quotes
from
the
congress
in
1889
was
that
congress
was
applying
a
federal
requirement.
mr.
slade
gorton
of
a
state
constitutional
amendment
by
the
action
of
the
people.
yet,
south
dakota
rejected
that.
in
writing
its
constitution,
said
this
legislature
could
do
it
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
approved
south
dakota's
constitution
as
being
in
total
conformity
with
the
enabling
act.
if
the
solicitor
general's
argument
is
correct,
one
star
should
come
out
of
the
flag
because
south
dakota
is
not
validly
in
the
union.
this
is
exactly
--
mr.
slade
gorton
i
hope
so.
this
is
exactly
what
our
state
supreme
court
interpreted
our
constitutional
disclaimer
to
require.
by
1968
of
course,
congress
knew
both
of
our
state
supreme
court
decisions
and
of
the
similar
ninth
circuit
court
decision
in
quinault.
the
solicitor
general
himself
agreed
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
in
a
brief
submitted
to
you
in
quinault.
the
congress
had
listened
at
length
to
both
the
legal
and
policy
arguments
of
the
yakima's
and
their
supporters
on
the
subject.
congress
knew
that
washington's
assumption
under
public
law
280
was
both
the
most
significant
and
the
most
controversial
of
all
of
the
option
states,
but
the
congress
consciously
and
explicitly
in
1968
confirmed
preexisting
assumptions
of
jurisdiction
and
obviously
meant
to
include
washington.
next,
the
tribe
and
the
solicitor
general
assert
that
public
law
280
did
not
authorize
what
they
characterized
as
washington's
partial
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
but
washington
did
not
obligate
and
bind
itself
to
use
the
terms
of
the
act
to
merely
partial
jurisdiction
but
to
full
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
it
did
so
twice
in
1957
and
in
1963.
the
solicitor
general
quarrels
with
the
manner
in
which
the
state
assumed
the
jurisdiction
in
1963.
in
that
year,
the
state
obligated
and
bound
itself
to
assume
full
jurisdiction
but
it
did
not
exercise
full
jurisdiction
on
the
yakima
reservation
because
it
made
that
exercise
subject
to
the
consent
of
the
yakima
tribe.
we
did
what
public
law
280
required
of
us
even
if
public
law
280
required
a
state
commitment
to
assume
full
jurisdiction,
a
requirement
which
is
evident
neither
on
the
phase
of
the
statute
nor
in
its
legislative
history.
by
now
incidentally,
it
should
be
abundantly
clear
that
while
the
formal
position
of
the
tribe
and
the
solicitor
general
is
that
the
state
exercise
is
too
little
jurisdiction,
their
actual
grievance
is
that
it
exercises
too
much.
at
any
rate,
the
ninth
circuit
not
only
upheld
the
1963
state
statute
in
quinault,
it
characterized
it
as
we
do
as
an
undertaking
to
assume
full
jurisdiction
as
authorized
by
public
law
280.
that
court
also
focused
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
could
condition
its
exercise
of
full
jurisdiction
on
tribal
consent
and
decided
that
it
could
do
so.
when
the
quinault's
attempted
to
bring
that
decision
before
this
court
in
1967,
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
brief
here
agreeing
with
us
that
washington's
assumption
of
jurisdiction
was
valid
even
though
he
characterized
it
as
partial.
the
solicitor
general
still
believes
that
the
phrase
“in
such
manner”
in
section
7
of
public
law
280
permitted
the
state
to
condition
its
assumption
of
jurisdiction
in
its
entirety
on
tribal
consent.
we
can
see
nothing
in
that
phrase
which
forbids
state-by-state
flexibility
in
dealing
with
the
extent
to
which
each
authorizes
a
tribal
option.
for
that
matter,
the
phrase
does
not
seem
to
bar
even
a
true
assumption
of
only
partial
jurisdiction,
a
course
which
is
actually
adopted
by
five
option
states.
after
all,
the
1953
congress
wished
to
facilitate
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
by
the
states
and
itself
provided
for
a
form
of
partial
jurisdiction
in
all
but
one
of
the
mandatory
states.
it
knew
less
about
the
situation
in
the
option
states
while
it
was
actually
working
in
drafting
public
law
280.
it's
thus
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
was
not
willing
to
permit
flexibility
in
those
states
and
impossible
to
find
such
an
unwillingness
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history.
mr.
slade
gorton
what
the
washington
constitution
--
does
not
permit
the
amendment
of
our
constitution
by
an
initiative.
it
permits
the
legislature
to
call
a
constitutional
convention
after
an
affirmative
vote
of
the
people,
which
can
then
deal
with
the
constitution
as
it
will.
the
only
method
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
washington
thus
--
did
not
violate
public
law
280
by
the
manner
in
which
it
obligated
itself
to
assume
jurisdiction.
by
1968,
the
congress
knew
of
the
details
of
the
washington
system.
it
knew
that
the
yakima's
and
their
supporters
objected
to
that
system
strenuously.
those
tribes
pressed
vigorously
for
the
right
of
unilateral
retrocession.
the
congress
knew
of
the
quinault
decision,
validating
the
washington
system
but
knew
that
the
department
of
the
interior
believed
in
the
validity
of
that
washington
system
and
that
interior
asserted
that
partial
jurisdiction
was
not
only
a
good
concept
but
was
authorized
by
public
law
280.
congress
heard
other
witnesses
on
the
other
hand
who
felt
that
the
option
of
partial
jurisdiction
was
such
a
good
idea
that
it
should
be
expressly
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
in
1968,
with
this
knowledge,
congress
rejected
the
yakima's
demand
for
unilateral
retrocession,
ended
the
argument
over
partial
jurisdiction
by
expressly
authorizing
it,
and
confirmed
preexisting
assumptions
of
jurisdiction
of
which
washington's
had
been
pivotal
during
the
debate
leading
up
to
those
1968
amendments
to
public
law
280.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
slade
gorton
a
constitutional
amendment
in
the
state
of
washington
in
the
normal
sense
is
proposed
by
the
legislature
enacted
on
by
the
people.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
legislature
may
also
call
for
a
constitutional
convention,
which
if
it
is
approved
by
the
people
then
meets,
then
presumably
can
write
an
entirely
new
constitution.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
but
the
actions
of
that
convention
would
have
to
be
approved
by
the
people.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
true.
if
a
constitutional
convention
is
called
into
being
in
the
state
of
washington,
its
actions
if
any
would
be
subject
to
the
approval
by
the
people.
our
point
in
connection
with
this
case
is
that
article
xxvi,
which
includes
the
disclaimer
clause,
has
in
it
the
preamble,
the
preamble
that
it
is
a
compact
with
the
united
states
which
can't
be
changed
without
the
permission
of
congress
and
the
people
of
the
state.
it
is
that
phrase
“the
people
of
the
state”
which
our
state
constitution
has
interpreted
as
meaning
the
people
of
the
state
acting
through
their
legislature,
exactly
the
way
south
dakota
more
expressly
provided.
in
other
words,
we
have
not
amended
the
article
xxvi
of
our
constitution
or
disclaimer
clause
any
more
than
congress
has
amended
the
enabling
act
itself.
but
congress
said
notwithstanding
the
enabling
act,
you
can
do
what
you
need
to
take
jurisdiction.
we
have
done
what
we
needed
to
take
jurisdiction
and
we
did
not
need
to
amend
article
xxvi
in
order
to
do
so.
mr.
slade
gorton
correct.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
slade
gorton
legislation
is
often
preceded
when
it
passes
the
legislature
“by
the
people”
of
the
state
of
x
hereby
enacts
the
following
code
of
laws.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
enabling
act
was
of
course
passed
by
congress.
the
united
states
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
neither
then
nor
--
the
united
states
neither
then
nor
today
has
any
power
of
referendum
or
any
submission
directly
to
the
people
for
votes.
most
states,
including
washington
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
i
am
not,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
slade
gorton
public
law
28
--
in
public
law
280,
congress
took
--
gave
its
permission.
it
wiped
out
the
contract,
its
side
of
the
contract
under
which
the
states
were
forbidden
to
take
jurisdiction
in
its
entirety.
it
says
notwithstanding
the
enabling
act,
and
that
means
notwithstanding
the
reference
to
congress
and
notwithstanding
the
reference
to
the
people.
notwithstanding
the
enabling
act,
a
state
may
amend
its
constitution
where
necessary
in
order
to
take
jurisdiction.
now,
the
same
phrase
appears
in
this
as
a
preamble
to
article
xxvi.
the
state
supreme
court
in
interpreting
article
xxvi
not
the
enabling
act,
in
interpreting
article
xxvi
said
that
under
the
laws
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
washington,
the
people
speak
through
the
legislature.
now,
congress
approved
that
idea
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
in
1889
because
it
accepted
it
from
south
dakota.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
connection
with
removing
any
impediment
to
take
jurisdiction
on
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
slade
gorton
no.
the
--
if
that
frame
--
article
of
the
constitution
had
not
had
such
a
preamble
which
authorized
the
legislature
to
act
presumably
as
long
ago
as
1889
when
congress
had
given
its
consent
that
answer
would
not
have
obtained
in
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
there
was
an
independent
federal
requirement.
yes,
you
have
always
allowed
state
supreme
courts
to
interpret
state
constitutions.
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
this
was
a
federal
requirement.
our
position
is
the
federal
requirement
was
totally
wiped
out
by
the
congress
when
it
passed
public
law
280;
that's
what
it
wanted
to
do.
it
gave
the
state
the
permission
to
do
whatever
state
law
required
to
get
rid
of
its
disclaimer
clause
language.
the
failure
of
the
solicitor
general
to
join
the
tribe
in
defending
the
ninth
circuit
panel's
decision
overturning
the
state
law
on
equal
protection
grounds
speaks
volumes.
as
the
solicitor
general
said
in
his
memorandum,
preceding
you're
noting
probable
jurisdiction
--
mr.
slade
gorton
i'm
moving
to
the
equal
protection,
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
did
urge
that
as
the
introduction
to
this
entire
argument
(voice
overlap).
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
excuse
me,
there
is
a
statutory
question
before
you
very
clearly.
the
statutory
question
this
before
you
without
any
doubt
whatsoever
is
whether
or
not
washington
assumed
the
jurisdiction
in
the
manner
required
by
the
congress
in
section
7
of
public
law
280,
the
question
which
we
don't
believe
is
before
you.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
--
because
its
of
--
mr.
slade
gorton
pardon?
mr.
slade
gorton
partial
jurisdiction
is
listed
in
the
question
as
you
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
that
question
is
noted.
we
cannot
win
actually
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
from
which
we're
appealing,
went
off
on
equal
protection
grounds.
the
ninth
circuit
had
previously
said
that
we
were
right
on
this
partial
jurisdiction.
mr.
slade
gorton
en
banc,
they
said
that
we
were
fine
on
partial
jurisdiction.
then
a
three-judge
panel
said
that
we
were
--
that
we
lost
because
we
denied
equal
protection
by
the
method
in
which
we
took
jurisdiction.
the
statutory
interpretation
question
is
here
because
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
win
that
as
well
as
the
equal
protection
question
in
order
to
validate
our
act.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
was
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it's
in
the
order
noting
--
your
order
noting
probable
jurisdiction.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
we
do
--
mr.
slade
gorton
but
when
the
united
states
replied
and
when
the
tribe
replied
to
us,
they
brought
up
these
additional
questions.
mr.
slade
gorton
because
they
didn't
want
to
be
limited
to
the
rather
weak
equal
protection
argument
of
the
ninth
circuit
panel.
mr.
slade
gorton
and
so
you
in
effect
listed
two,
not
listing
the
disclaimer
clause
question.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
they
did
not.
in
fact,
the
state's
choice
was
not
only
--
not
irrational,
it
was
both
reasoned
and
logical.
it
tied
at
the
tribal
option,
the
tribal
choice
of
law
to
indian
lands
or
the
lands
under
indian
control.
most
non-indian
residents
and
businesses
on
the
reservation
are
located
on
fee
land.
most
transactions
between
indians
and
non-indians
like
those
involved
in
your
cases
of
williams
versus
lee
and
kennerly
take
place
on
fee
land.
there's
no
doubt
do
most
indian
claims
against
non-indians
for
consumer
fraud.
most
traffic
offenses
and
minor
crimes
by
both
indians
and
non-indians
which
affect
one
another
in
integrated
society
take
place
on
fee
land.
thus,
it
was
on
fee
land
that
the
legislature
--
with
fee
land
that
the
legislature
was
most
concerned
about
establishing
a
uniformed
system
of
law.
obviously,
that
concern
affected
indian
lands
as
well,
especially
in
the
field
of
traffic
offenses
and
various
social
programs
administered
and
financed
by
the
state.
but
there,
the
indian
desire
for
tribal
self-government
was
a
major
countervailing
consideration.
so
on
the
classic
manner
of
all
legislative
bodies,
the
washington
legislature
compromised
the
demands
of
those
who
wanted
plenary
state
jurisdiction
everywhere
and
the
tribes
who
wanted
no
state
jurisdiction
anywhere.
the
ninth
circuit
panel
decision
from
which
this
appeal
is
taken
found
as
a
basis
for
its
equal
protection
holding
that
a
yakima
indian
living
on
trust
land
received
no
law
enforcement
protection
from
the
state
while
its
indian
neighbor
on
fee
land
did.
that
is
a
fatally
erroneous
view
of
the
effect
of
the
states
law.
state
law
does
protect
the
member
of
the
yakima
tribe
on
trust
land
from
anyone
except
a
fellow
member
of
the
yakima
tribe,
and
that
omission
is
due
solely
to
the
choice
which
the
tribe
has
made.
even
in
that
situation,
the
tribal
member
is
treated
exactly
as
a
non-indian
on
trust
land
who
also
lacks
state
law
protection
as
against
the
member
of
the
yakima
tribe.
the
distinction
is
not
based
on
a
difference
in
the
need
for
legal
protection
by
the
state
but
on
the
state's
concern
in
1963
for
the
preservation
of
a
maximum
of
tribal
self-government.
in
antelope
less
than
two
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
the
use
of
land
status
is
the
basis
for
the
choice
of
which
criminal
law
is
applicable
to
an
indian
did
not
constitute
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
it
was
simply
of
no
consequence
that
the
federal
criminal
code
differed
from
that
of
the
surrounding
state.
in
antelope,
that
choice
of
law
worked
to
the
detriment
of
the
indian
defendant.
in
this
case,
it
works
to
the
advantage
of
the
indian
who
prefers
federal
or
tribal
jurisdiction
to
that
of
the
state.
and
in
footnote
13
of
antelope,
you
recognize
that
a
similar
choice
of
law
at
question
would
be
involved
on
almost
any
military
base.
actually,
scores
of
military
reservations
throughout
the
united
states
are
divided
into
not
two
but
three
types
of
jurisdiction,
exclusive
federal,
exclusive
state,
and
concurrent
jurisdiction,
depending
on
the
date
and
circumstances
under
which
the
united
states
acquired
its
title.
that
haphazard
mixture
is
apparently
of
no
constitutional
significance
and
in
addition
to
that,
it
seems
to
work.
there
are
of
course
some
limits
to
the
tribal
option
offered
by
the
state
even
on
indian
land.
the
eight
subjects
enumerated
in
r.c.w.
37.12.010.
the
tribe
attacks
that
form
of
what
it
calls
partial
jurisdiction,
as
well
as
the
geographical
distinctions
based
on
trust
status
as
an
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
equal
protection
and
due
process.
we've
already
--
i've
already
discussed
the
rationale
for
the
state's
handling
of
those
eight
subjects
on
trust
lands
but
that
same
rationale
caused
the
congress
in
1929
and
again
in
1946
in
25
u.s.
code
231
to
authorize
the
state's
partial
subject
matter
jurisdiction
on
indian
reservations
over
health
regulations
and
compulsory
school
attendance.
and
in
1968,
the
congress
amended
public
law
280
expressly
to
permit
partial
subject
matter
jurisdiction
with
consent
over
any
subject.
by
reason
of
those
1968
amendments
to
public
law
280,
partial
retrocession
is
also
possible.
but
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
no
such
request
for
the
state
legislature
has
ever
been
made
by
the
yakima
tribe.
clearly,
the
tools
now
exist
for
a
flexible
approach
to
state
jurisdictions
and
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
that
they
are
used
to
accommodate
both
indians
and
non-indians
either
now
or
in
the
past
would
constitute
a
denial
of
equal
protection
or
due
process
to
either
group.
finally,
the
subject
matter
of
this
controversy
has
of
course
been
before
the
congress
almost
continuously
for
two
centuries
and
will
without
doubt
be
considered
there
again
and
again.
the
solicitor
general
and
the
tribe
therefore
ask
you
to
frustrate
the
obvious
intention
of
both
the
1953
and
the
1968
congresses
and
of
the
washington
state
legislature.
they
assert
that
the
practical
affect
of
such
a
determination
would
be
minimal.
they
can
make
that
assertion
only
by
ignoring
reality
and
by
assuming,
as
the
ninth
circuit
panel
did,
that
only
the
tribe
is
affected
by
this
controversy.
the
1963
legislature
in
contrast
with
what
we
believe
was
a
considerable
better
understanding
of
the
way
in
which
an
integrated
society
actually
operates
was
concerned
with
the
welfare
of
all
its
citizens.
it
sought
a
stable
legal
system
which
recognized
the
legitimate
aspirations
of
both
indians
and
of
their
non-indian
neighbors.
instead
of
wiping
out
tribal
self-government
in
the
jurisdiction
field
entirely
as
the
solicitor
general
believes
the
state
had
to
do
under
public
law
280,
the
state
substantially
preserved
it.
instead
of
ignoring
the
desire
of
reservation
non-indians
for
the
right
to
be
governed
by
their
own
laws,
a
demand
not
unfamiliar
to
those
who
live
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
legislature
granted
that
right
but
not
to
its
maximum
extent
without
the
consent
of
the
tribes
whose
members
are
also
voting
citizens
of
the
county
and
the
state.
washington
did
what
it
was
authorized
to
do
by
public
law
280
and
did
it
well.
mr.
slade
gorton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
white,
you
were
inadvertently
i'm
certain
totally
100%
misled
by
the
answers
of
both
mr.
claiborne
and
mr.
hovis
to
your
question
on
the
scope
of
r.c.w.
37.12.010.
that
statute
--
under
that
statute,
the
state
of
washington
obligates
and
binds
itself
to
assume
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
over
indians
and
indian
territory,
reservations,
counties,
lands,
country
lands,
the
whole
works.
it
is
of
course
from
that
statute
that
we
derive
our
jurisdiction
to
try
a
non-indian
for
assaulting
an
indian
which
we
did
not
have
under
u.s.
v.
mcbratney.
mr.
slade
gorton
precisely
every
prosecuting
attorney
in
the
state
knows
that.
mr.
slade
gorton
that's
simply
nonsense.
my
co-counsel
here
is
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
yakima
county
who
literally
does
that
every
week.
in
any
of
that,
that
that
source
of
jurisdiction,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
because
of
that
reading
of
37.12.010
that
i
indicated
to
you
what
i
did.
the
protection
--
mr.
slade
gorton
non-indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
will
--
absolutely,
except
for
the
mcbratney
conception.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
ninth
circuit
--
the
ninth
circuit
does
that
totally
without
condition.
the
ninth
circuit
may
not
have
invalidated
the
1957
act
but
the
1957
act
isn't
applicable
to
the
yakimas
since
they
did
not
petition
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
slade
gorton
except
for
the
mcbratney
exception.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
state
would
still
--
mr.
slade
gorton
a
non-indian.
exactly.
in
any
event,
that
statute
is
what
gives
to
indians
and
non-indians
on
both
fee
lands
and
non-fee
lands,
on
trust
lands
exactly
the
same
measure
of
protection.
they
have
total
protection
on
fee
lands.
both
the
indian
and
the
non-indian
have
protection
on
trust
lands
against
everyone
except
for
a
member
of
the
yakima
tribe.
the
indian
and
non-indian
are
in
exactly
the
same
situation.
mr.
slade
gorton
on
fee
lands
within
the
reservations
are
totally
subject
to
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
yes,
it
does.
now,
i
didn't
go
--
i
did
answer
your
first
question
to
me
on
my
direct
as
well
as
i
should
have.
actually,
that
police
confusion
is
practically
non-existent
because
the
tribal
code
is
practically
identical
in
all
of
its
definitions
to
the
state
criminal
code.
that's
simply
a
practical
matter,
however.
the
other
matter
which
really
amounted
to
retrying
his
case,
which
mr.
hovis
stated
here
even
though
he
did
not
prevail
on
the
trial
court,
has
to
do
with
his
outrageous
use
of
arrest
figures.
and
mr.
justice
stevens
really
answered
that
question.
what
has
happened
mr.
justice
stevens
is
that
those
arrests
now
are
being
made
by
the
tribal
police
under
their
deputization
from
the
county
sheriff.
the
same
number
of
people
are
being
arrested.
they
aren't
being
arrested
by
the
deputy
sheriff
and
i
mean
a
deputy
sheriff
because
the
tribe
keeps
us
off
of
two-thirds,
you
know,
has
closed
to
two-thirds
of
the
reservation
to
entry
by
non-indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
the
arrest
figures
that
were
given
there
were
arrest
figures
by
the
county
sheriff.
mr.
slade
gorton
not
--
not
by
anyone
else,
not
by
the
state
patrol,
which
among
other
things
have
four
times
as
many
arrests
as
the
county
sheriff
did,
and
which
is
also
cross-deputized
by
the
tribal
police.
now,
back
to
the
submission
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
matter,
the
solicitor
general
wishes
that
the
phrase
“where
necessary”
were
not
in
the
statute
and
it
would
make
his
case
a
great
deal
easier
and
mind
a
great
deal
--
more
difficult.
but
he
so
--
he
says,
“well,
maybe
it
just
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
these
are
disclaimer
states
or
maybe
it
applies
only
to
statutes.”
but
of
course,
it
doesn't.
that
phrase
appears
right
after
the
word
“amend”,
to
amend
where
necessary
its
constitution
or
statutes,
and
what
it
means
is
quite
obvious.
it
means
that
the
state
determines
under
state
law
whether
it's
necessary
to
amend
a
constitution
or
a
statute.
if
it
is
not
necessary
under
state
law,
the
state
is
a
section
7
rather
than
a
section
6
state.
congress
was
not
interested
in
building
up
extra
fences
making
additional
federal
requirements
which
didn't
pre-exist.
i
simply
wish
to
go
back
to
the
point
which
i
made
a
great
deal
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
this
requirement
of
a
vote
by
the
people
was
made
way
back
in
1889.
but
when
in
1889,
south
dakota
said,
“no,
sir.
it's
not
by
the
people.”
the
president
of
the
united
states
accepted
that
as
total
compliance
with
the
same
enabling
act.
south
dakota,
washington,
montana
were
admitted
pursuant
to
the
same
enabling
act.
that
debate
actually
was
all
over
south
dakota
in
its
--
or
dakota
at
its
division
into
two
separate
states.
40
states
in
the
country,
35
states
rather,
very
clearly
have
neither
enabling
acts
nor
were
required
to
take
jurisdiction
on
a
mandatory
basis.
yet,
they
were
given
the
choice
to
determine
under
state
law
what
jurisdiction
they
wish
to
take.
the
problem
with
this
entire
argument,
we
would
be
here
before
you
--
we
would
not
be
here
before
you
at
all
because
of
the
fact
that
you
have
already
decided
the
enabling
act
question,
except
for
the
fact
that
we
were
more
considerate
of
the
tribal
desire
for
self-government
than
was
any
other
state
that
dealt
with
public
law
280.
their
argument
is
you
could
give
the
tribes
that
option;
is
what
it
amounts
to.
we
took
full
jurisdiction,
mr.
justice
white.
we
exercised
full
jurisdiction
over
everything
that
was
covered
by
the
enabling
act
even
when
the
enabling
act
was
in
full
effect.
fee
lands
as
i've
said
earlier
in
an
argument
that
was
not
answered
here,
fee
lands
are
not
covered
by
the
enabling
act
at
all.
and
over
them,
we
took
full
jurisdiction
on
those
lands
in
which
the
indians
have
the
greatest
interest.
the
ones
which
they
own
or
which
are
held
in
trust
for
them,
we
deferred
to
them,
to
the
tribe.
we
agreed
--
mr.
slade
gorton
except
in
the
eight
categories.
we
agreed
to
take
full
jurisdiction
because
that's
what
we're
required
to
do.
but
that
statute,
section
7
also
says
at
such
time
as
the
state
legislature
may
determine.
that
time
is
when
the
yakima
tribe
agrees.
we
gave
them
a
choice,
a
generous
choice,
and
we
should
not
be
penalized
for
it.
