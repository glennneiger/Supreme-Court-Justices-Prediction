justice
potter
stewart
and
held
--
and
further
held
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
it
was
not
necessary.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
were
i
think
eight
or
nine
tribes
that
made
such
a
request.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
one
i'm
talking
about,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
or
be
made
by
---
however,
the
state
constitution
provides
that
the
constitution
itself
can
be
amended,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
a
cons
--
of
a
state
constitutional
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
or
whether
or
not
--
but
your
contention
that
congress
was
correct
in
its
understanding
is
not
really
a
necessary
part
of
your
argument,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
your
basic
argument
is
that
right
or
whether
congress
was
right
or
wrong
about
the
necessity
of
providing
what
it
did,
it
did
in
fact
so
provide.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
a
limitation
upon
what
punishment
can
be
imposed
now.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
limitation
upon
the
maximum
punishment
that
can
be
imposed
by
a
tribal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
six
months,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
it
is.
there
is
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it's
a
crime
that
calls
for
a
greater
punishment
in
that,
the
tribe
has
no
jurisdiction
over
it,
i
take
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
tribe
does
have
jurisdiction
but
on
the
wheeler
decision,
the
federal
government
can
then
prosecute
for
the
same
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
be
void
by
double
jeopardy.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
and
we're
--
only
thing
we
can
do
is
to
prosecute
indians
on
trust
grounds
except
for
the
eight
undefined
and
unreferenced
categories.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
thought
it
was
your
claim
that
you
had
concurrent
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
is
that
--
but
that
wasn't
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
below
but
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
mean,
the
judgment
had
been
reviewed
here
but
you
asked
that
this
court,
even
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
that
we
proceed
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
jurisdiction
is
concurrent.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
understood
your
brief
decided,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
the
district
court's
opinion.
it
--
district
court's
opinion.
now,
with
all
these
problems
we
have
with
having
these
treaty
powers
and
having
them
taking
away,
this
is
--
this
public
law
280
affects
the
yakima
tribe.
we
think
it
does
not.
that's
the
first
problem
that
we
think
is
a
way
--
this
court
can
handle
this
question.
now,
we
don't
think
that
this
law
affects
the
yakima
nation
and
let
me
explain
to
you
why
not.
we
have
those
explicit
and
implicit
powers
to
govern
our
people
in
our
own
way
by
our
own
government.
now,
washington
has
contended
that
congress
has
the
power
to
--
absolute
power
to
abrogate
these
treaty
powers
and
these
treaty
provisions.
we
disagree.
we
think
that
this
court
has
said
that
this
power
is
not
absolute
and
that
to
abrogate
the
treaty
that
congress
must
act
in
a
constitutional
manner,
number
one
and
two
most
specifically
and
explicitly
abrogate
the
involved
treaty
provisions.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
that
question
has
been
decided
for
us,
hasn't
it,
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
and
even
if
we
--
as
sitting
on
the
sidelines
might
think
it's
a
very
wrong
decision,
it's
none
of
our
business.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
federal
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
--
that
hasn't
--
is
that
argument
made
here?
justice
potter
stewart
if
necessary,
congress
said.
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
or
not
it's
necessary,
it's
a
matter
of
state
law,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
whether
or
not
it's
necessary
to
amend
the
washington
constitution
in
order
for
the
washington
legislature
to
do
this
or
that
or
the
other
thing,
isn't
that
wholly
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
a
matter
(voice
overlap)
of
state
constitutional
law.
justice
potter
stewart
without
question.
justice
potter
stewart
without
question.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gorton,
you
said
except
something
and
i'm
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
a
non-indian
against
a
non-indian.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
the
tribal
policeman
is
acting
as
a
county
deputy
sheriff,
wouldn't
the
arrest
figures
show
that
the
arrest
was
made
by
a
deputy
sheriff?
justice
potter
stewart
not
by
the
deputy?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
a
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
we
are
called
upon
in
this
case
to
resolve
a
dispute
between
the
state
of
washington
and
the
yakima
indian
nation
over
the
validity
of
the
state's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
on
the
yakima
reservation.
in
1963,
the
washington
legislature
acting
under
the
asserted
authority
of
a
federal
law,
public
law
280
obligated
the
state
to
assume
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
indians
and
indian
territory
within
the
state
subject
only
to
the
condition
that
in
all
but
eight
subject
matter
areas,
jurisdiction
would
not
extend
to
indians
on
trust
or
restricted
lands
without
the
request
of
the
indian
tribe
affected.
that
state
law
was
chapter
36
of
the
1963
washington
laws.
the
yakima
nation
did
not
make
such
a
request
and
state
authority
over
indians
within
the
yakima
reservation
was
therefore
made
by
chapter
36
to
depend
on
the
title
status
of
the
property
on
which
the
offense
or
transaction
occurred
and
upon
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter.
the
yakima
nation
brought
this
action
in
a
federal
district
court
challenging
the
statutory
and
constitutional
validity
of
the
state's
partial
assertion
of
jurisdiction
on
its
reservation.
the
district
court
decided
the
case
in
favor
of
the
state.
its
judgment
was
ultimately
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
ground
that
the
checker
board
pattern
of
jurisdiction
created
by
chapter
36
in
this
case
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
state
appealed
that
judgment
to
this
court.
the
yakima
nation
relies
on
three
separate
and
independent
grounds
in
asserting
that
chapter
36
is
invalid.
first,
it
argues
that
under
the
terms
of
public
law
280,
washington
was
not
authorized
to
enact
chapter
36
until
the
state
constitution
had
been
amended
by
the
people
so
as
to
eliminate
its
provision
which
disclaims
state
authority
over
indian
lands.
second,
it
contends
that
public
law
280
does
not
authorize
any
state
to
extend
only
partial
jurisdiction
over
an
indian
reservation.
finally,
it
asserts
that
chapter
36
even
if
authorized
by
public
law
280
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
as
the
court
of
appeals
held.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
the
court's
necessarily
discursive
written
opinion,
we
reject
all
of
these
claims
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
