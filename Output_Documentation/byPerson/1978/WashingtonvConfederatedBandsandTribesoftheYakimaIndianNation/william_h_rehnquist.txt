justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
washington
law
permit
the
amendment
of
the
washington
constitution
by
a
convention,
as
well
as
by
a
referendum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
some
stage
though,
there's
a
public
referendum
on
the
proposed
amendment
to
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
that
wasn't
raised
in
the
briefs
of
the
petitioner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
even
if
it
wasn't
as
presented
as
a
part
of
this
question
presented
in
the
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
have
some
problem
with
the
equal
footing
clause
and
the
distinction
between
the
five
states
you're
talking
about
and
the
other
states
of
which
you
were
--
so
that
washington
was
not
given
equal
footing
when
it
was
admitted
to
the
union,
if
you're
construction
is
correct.
i
mean,
to
what
extent
can
congress
impose
a
limitation
on
a
state
sovereignty
that
is
not
imposed
on
other
states
and
have
it
survive
the
adoption
of
the
state
constitution,
its
submission
to
the
union,
like
the
coyle
case
where
congress
prescribed
where
the
capital
of
oklahoma
should
be
located.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
would
have
been
some
difficulty
in
treating
oregon
and
washington
differently,
wouldn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
enabling
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
--
my
question
goes
further
back
in
that
and
what
i'm
referring
to
is
the
doctrine
of
the
coyle
case
which
is
221
us
559
where
the
court
said
that
even
though
congress
puts
--
insists
that
a
state
put
something
in
its
constitution
as
a
condition
for
coming
into
the
union,
the
state
may
later
repudiate
that
if
the
result
of
not
repudiating
would
be
to
give
it
less
of
an
equal
footing
than
the
other
states
that
were
admitted
without
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
in
view
of
the
language
of
section
6
that
even
though
only
a
statutory
amendment
had
required
--
had
been
required
under
state
law,
that
would
nonetheless
have
to
have
been
“by
the
people”
rather
than
by
the
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
the
language
is
exactly
the
same
in
the
law
as
written.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
point
number
one,
what
do
you
do
with
lone
wolf
against
hitchcock?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
it's
decided
in
(inaudible)
or
in
a
case
that
was
recently
as
two
years
ago.
