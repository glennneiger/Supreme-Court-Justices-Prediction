mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
concentrate
my
argument
on
the
disclaimer
point
that
is
the
proposition
that
the
state
of
washington
could
not
assert
any
additional
jurisdiction
over
indian
reservations
within
its
borders
without
first
amending
its
state
constitution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
we
take
view
i
hope
correctly
that
an
appellee
is
entitled
to
defend
the
judgment
in
his
favor
under
section
1254
(2)
of
the
judicial
code
on
any
federal
ground.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
--
mr.
justice
white,
there
might
be
a
problem.
the
relief
here
however
would
be
identical
whether
that
judgment
is
sustained
on
the
ground
reached
by
the
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
white,
so
did
the
panel
decision
in
this
case
find
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
finding
impossible
to
sever
the
permissible
and
impermissible
portions,
the
ninth
circuit
struck
down
the
entire
washington
laws.
i
appreciate
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
panel.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
so,
mr.
justice
white.
we
deal
with
this
matter
of
jurisdiction
that
is
the
propriety
of
the
appellees
raising
these
statutory
grounds
in
--
on
page
15
and
16
of
our
brief
and
particularly
footnote
9
thereof.
if
i
may
in
the
shortness
of
time
turn
to
the
substance
of
the
argument,
may
i
begin
in
this
way?
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
the
propositions
put
from
this
side
of
the
table
frustrate
the
true
intent
of
congress.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
far
from
weaving
any
fine-spun
arguments
or
erecting
any
technical
obstacles
to
defeat
what
everybody
knows
congress
intended
in
1953,
we
on
the
contrary
are
faithful
to
that
congressional
intent
in
1889,
in
1953,
in
1968.
that
is
demonstrable
in
at
least
two
ways.
but
for
congress'
recognition
that
washington
had
what
appeared
to
be
an
impediment
in
its
state
constitution,
it
is
predictable
with
some
assurance
that
washington
would
have
been
treated
as
her
neighbor
oregon
and
as
four
other
states,
that
is,
would
have
been
subjected
to
automatic
or
mandatory
coverage.
that
is
because
the
five
states
that
were
so
treated
in
pubic
law
280
were
those
where
the
responsible
officials
had
consulted
both
the
state
authorities
and
the
tribes
and
therefore,
the
department
of
the
interior
was
in
a
position
to
say
to
congress,
“these
states
want
jurisdiction.
the
tribes
either
acquiesce
or
wish
to
be
exempted.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
take
it
that
there
would
have
been
no
constitutional
difficulty
in
congress'
including
washington
with
the
other
five,
making
it
six,
just
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
alaska,
a
disclaimer
state.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
they
did.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
public
law
280
is
unconstitutional
because
oregon
was
immediately
given
jurisdiction
whereas
washington
was
not.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
obviously
missing
the
thrust
of
your
question.
i
take
it
this
clear
that
congress
could
have
overwritten
the
disclaimer
and
indeed
the
state
constitutional
disclaimer
in
article
xxvi
just
as
it
did
in
the
case
of
alaska,
which
had
those
impediments,
and
they
could
have
treated
washington
as
it
did
oregon
by
giving
it
immediate
coverage.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i'm
not
in
the
least
attempting
to
take
on
the
coyle
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
since
here,
congress
gave
permission
to
the
state
to
remove
this
obstacle.
the
coyle
problem
would
seem
to
disappear.
but
my
suggestion
was,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
--
but
for
congress'
recognition
that
washington
like
seven
other
states
had
impediment
in
its
constitution
because
it
had
consulted
with
the
state
officials
in
washington,
and
we
have
congressman
westland's
word
for
it
in
the
congressional
committee
that
washington
wants
to
come
in
on
jurisdiction.
the
indians
had
been
consulted
and
two
of
the
tribes
had
indicated
their
objection.
what
is
more,
the
department
of
interior
indicated
that
they
would
at
least
tentatively
recommend
exemption
of
those
two
tribes,
and
one
of
those
two
tribes
is
the
yakima
tribe.
so
that
if
washington
had
been
treated
like
oregon,
the
result
would
have
been
that
washington
would
have
been
fully
covered
except
only
for
the
colville
and
the
yakima
indians
who,
like
the
warm
spring
indians
in
oregon,
would've
been
exempted
and
this
problem
would
never
arisen.
now,
that
is
how
congress
treated
ever
objecting
tribe
with
respect
to
whom
the
department
of
the
interior
indicated
that
they
had
a
functioning
law
and
order
system,
no
reason
to
believe
the
yakima
wouldn't
have
been
similarly
exempted.
so
we
begin
there
that
it's
a
fluke
as
it
were
that
the
question
even
arises
with
respect
to
the
yakima.
what
is
more,
and
this
is
conceded
by
the
state
of
washington,
it
is
clear
that
if
anybody
had
walked
in
on
the
congressional
hearings
of
this
matter
in
1953,
they
would
have
come
away
with
the
conviction
that
every
member
sitting
thought
washington
could
not
take
jurisdiction
until
and
unless
it
had
amended
its
constitution.
and
for
that
reason
and
for
that
reason
alone,
congress
wrote
section
6
of
public
law
of
280.
and
not
only
did
it
write
section
6,
it
provided
the
proviso
of
a
section
6
as
to
the
effect
that
jurisdiction
under
this
act
shall
not
take
hold
until
after
the
appropriate
amendments
have
been
made.
so
the
congressional
understanding
was
that
washington
would
not
now
be
free
to
assume
jurisdiction
having
failed
to
take
any
action
to
amend
its
constitution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
had
the
obstacle
only
been
statutory,
the
legislative
history
is
ambiguous.
i
think
it
probably
right
to
say
that
in
that
event,
it
would
have
been
in
view
of
the
--
those
writing,
public
law
280
a
matter
to
be
determined
by
state
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
do
--
when
mr.
--
i
suggest
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
look
at
it
in
this
way,
the
words
where
necessary
or
introduced
for
one
of
two
reasons,
we
suggest.
either
simply
to
identify
those
states
with
disclaimers.
it
may
mean
nothing
more
than
that.
or
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
it
may
mean
where
there
are
only
statutes,
not
constitutional
provisions,
and
in
the
view
of
the
state
court,
it
is
nevertheless
necessary
to
remove
that
obstacle
by
popular
referendum.
it
was
so
suggested
by
a
committee
counsel
in
the
hearings
and
that
is
we
suggest
the
only
reason
why
the
words
“where
necessary”
were
introduced.
to
read
it
otherwise
is
to
make
section
6
wholly
surplusage
and
to
read
out
the
proviso
which
says,
“such
jurisdiction
shall
not
obtain
until
and
unless
the
appropriate
amendment
has
been
made.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
the
choice
of
the
word
people
was
because
of
the
recognition
that
it
a
constitution,
in
the
case
of
washington
and
as
everywhere
else,
has
to
be
by
popular
referendum,
but
that
would
--
does
do
doubles
service.
it
includes
the
legislative
amendment
of
the
statutes
and
it's
an
awkward
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
insofar
as
it
addresses
statutory
--
only
statutory
impediments.
i
think
that
is
the
best
we
can
do,
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
attempting
to
pass
out
what
was
in
the
congressional
mind.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
set
me
the
question
whether
congress
acted
on
its
understanding,
right
or
wrong,
that
the
washington
constitution
was
an
impediment
that
only
popular
referendum
could
erase
is
a
federal
question.
if
congress
acted
on
that
understanding
and
wrote
section
6
in
the
proviso
thereto
with
that
understanding;
that
is
binding
even
if
as
a
matter
of
state
law;
the
impediment
could
have
been
erased
by
legislature.
we
think
congress
did
act
on
that
understanding
whether
or
not
it
was
a
misunderstanding
and
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
state
must
do
what
congress
thought
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
take
jurisdiction.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
--
mr.
justice
white,
that's
an
interesting
in-between
situation
which
fortunately,
we
don't
have
to
face
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
had
they
amended
their
constitution
to
so
provide,
we
might
have
a
closer
question.
i
would
still
argue
that
the
state
was
bound
by
the
conditions
imposed
by
congress
whether
in
--
perfectly
clear
if
congress
had
said
the
states
of
washington
and
the
other
seven
shall
not
assume
this
jurisdiction
until
they
have
by
popular
referendum
amended
the
provisions
of
their
constitutions
which
we
rightly
or
wrongly
view
as
a
bar
to
their
taking
jurisdiction.
no
one
would
argue
in
those
circumstances
that
it
mattered
what
the
state
law
situation
were.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
we
say
that
--
construed
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history
that
is
what
the
court
is
confronted
with
in
section
6.
now,
we
do
go
on
to
say
that
congress
was
correct
in
assuming
that
the
obstacle
in
the
state
constitution,
because
it
derives
from
the
enabling
act
which
was
--
and
therefore
was
written
in
the
congress
for
a
federal
purpose
must,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
be
construed
as
not
erasable
by
any
means
other
than
a
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
mr.
justice
stewart,
exactly
so.
it
is
not
a
necessary
part.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
mr.
justice
stewart.
one
last
word,
if
i
may.
the
result
which
we
suggest
is
rightly
reached
in
this
case
does
conform
with
the
congressional
policy
in
1968
to
compel
the
parties,
the
tribe
and
the
state
to
reach
accommodations
at
arms
length
and
therefore
to
reduce
the
friction
and
the
inefficiency
of
a
law
enforcement
system
where
the
parties
are
at
odds.
the
parties
should
now
return
to
the
bargaining
table
as
free
agents
and
work
out
on
accommodations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
is
certainly
correct
that
our
submission
would,
though
perhaps
not
in
this
case,
but
the
logic
of
our
submission
would
invalidate
those
assumptions
with
respect
to
tribes
between
1957
and
1963
who
took
on
full
jurisdiction.
and
it
may
be
that
that
is
not
the
consequence
of
the
panel's
decisions
except
only
if
one
reads
the
63
act
and
the
57
act
as
part
of
a
whole.
and
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
white
that
that
is
how
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
panel.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
i
stand
corrected
and
withdraw
the
answer.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
insofar
as
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
did
hold
that
one
couldn't
pass
it
out.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
had
thought,
and
i
may
be
wrong
mr.
justice
white,
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
was
the
63
act
is
unconstitutional,
is
violative
of
equal
protection.
they
perhaps
left
standing
the
57
act
if
one
can
read
it
as
an
independent
legislation,
which
is
historically
because
it
was.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
if
one
looks
at
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
35
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
on
the
right
hand
column,
we
are
--
can
the
invalidated
portion
of
section
so
forth
be
separated
from
the
remainder
of
the
statute
or
does
the
whole
statute
fall?
the
washington
legislature
could
have
severed
these
provisions
but
we
cannot
do
so.
the
statute
contains
no
severability
clause.
we
are
unable
to
attribute
to
washington
the
willingness
to
include
more
jurisdiction
than
it
undertook
partially
to
assume.
and
i
read
that
perhaps
too
hurriedly
as
indicating
that
all
of
the
1963
statute,
with
its
discrimination
between
trust
and
non-trust
land
and
its
discrimination
between
cases
in
the
eight
categories
which
all
within
state
jurisdiction
even
over
trust
land
and
even
over
indian
defendants,
that
that
whole
complicated
structure
must
fall.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
only
the
1963
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
i
think
i
indicated,
i
must
withdraw
the
answer
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
white
and
agree
that
--
to
that
extent,
the
results
appeared
to
be
different,
that
is
to
say
that
the
question
there
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
result
may
be,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
while
the
successful
appellee
can
hardly
be
deprived
of
his
judgment
when
he
had
no
standing
to
bring
the
case
here
and
is
therefore
entitled
to
defend
it
on
any
federal
ground,
perhaps
the
judgment
cannot
go
further
than
we
would
have
gone
than
it
was
in
his
favor
below.
he
merely
defended
the
judgment;
he
can't
go
further.
i
would,
i
would
submit
that
submission.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed
mr.
justice
white
because
this
court
itself
indicated
its
willingness
to
entertain
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
it
is
the
reason
of
course
without
intending
to
disparage
any
other
argument
that
we
put
the
statutory
questions
first
and
foremost.
