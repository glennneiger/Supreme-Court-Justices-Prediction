justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
grounds
do
you
present
this
issue
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
success
of
your
--
what
if
your
ground,
if
you
succeeded,
if
it
were
sustained,
would
that
give
considerably
different
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
thought
this
--
if
you
invalidate
it
on
the
ground
that
you
are
about
to
urge,
it
would
invalidate
the
entire
law,
wouldn't
it?
the
--
washington's
entire
statutory
scheme.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
equal
protection
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
way
you
interpret
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
after
congress
acted
on
that
assumption,
washington
amended
its
constitution
so
as
to
make
amendments
adoptable
just
by
the
legislature?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
don't
know
the
--
since
that
time,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
has
interpreted
its
constitution
to
not
to
require
a
referendum.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
opinion
on
the
ninth
circuit
just
dealt
with
one
section,
its
equal
protection
clause,
subsection
10
--
of
the
--
how
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
--
how
about
the
--
mr.
claiborne
the
--
how
about
the
state
jurisdiction
over
non-indians,
over
whites?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
whites
against
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
dealt
with
only
one
section
and
that
section
dealt
only
with
indian
defendants.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
said
we
invalidate
section
37.12.010
and
37.12.010
cited
in
its
footnote,
just
deals
with
in
indian
defendants,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
it's
a
sort
of
a
housekeeping
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
reaching
--
in
reaching
statutory
questions
first
is
also
a
housekeeping
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it's
just
that
it
isn't
exclusive?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
opponents
suggest
that
washington
has
never
assumed
jurisdiction
over
crime
by
non-whites.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
picked
this
up
from
your
brief.
you
indicate
that
if
you
don't
prevail
here,
the
state's
jurisdiction
over
non-whites
--
over
whites,
over
non-indians
will
be
invalidated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
federal
government
will
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
not
--
that
would
not
expand
their
--
that
would
not
expand
the
relief
to
the
other
side.
that
was
covered
by
the
ninth
circuit
invalidated
that
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
indians
committing
crimes
on
fee
lands
within
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
there
does
--
there
is
a
difference
as
to
who
prosecutes
misdemeanors.
it
depends
on
where
they
were
committed.
