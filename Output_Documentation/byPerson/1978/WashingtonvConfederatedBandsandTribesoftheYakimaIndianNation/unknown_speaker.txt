unknown

do
some
non-indians
live
on
non-fee
land?
unknown
speaker
by
the
tribe
or
the
federal
(voice

on
behalf
of
the
tribe.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
it
--
doesn't
depend
on
what
law
is
applicable,
whether
there
has
been
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
the
arresting
officer
must
know
three
sets
of
laws.
unknown
speaker
but
he
must
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
depend
on
what
law
is
applicable,
whether
there
has
been
a
crime.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
materials
that
have
been
submitted
to
us
indicating
what
percentage
of
the
kinds
of
conduct
might
be
a
criminal
offense
under
one
or
more
of
these
laws
and
not
be
under
the
other?
unknown
speaker
but
presumably,
anything
that's
--
unknown
speaker
but
anything
that
readily
comes
to
mind
such
as
assault
and
battery
or
stealing,
or
larceny,
or
--
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not,
it
would
presumably
be
an
offense
under
both
state
law
and
tribal
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
--
the
washington
supreme
court
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
did
it
deal
with
the
claim
now
being
made
by
the
tribe
and
the
solicitor
general
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
it
was?
unknown
speaker
did
you
finish
your
answer
to
him?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
about
one
thing.
in
1957,
as
i
recall,
the
state
jurisdiction
with
the
consent
of
nine
other
tribes
as
to
nine
tribes
--
unknown
speaker
does
the
solicitor
general's
argument
apply
to
those
tribes
as
well
as
to
the
yakima
tribe?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
you're
moving
to
the
(voice
overlap)
argument
--
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
understand
you
to
urge
that
the
statutory
question
was
not
here
at
all.
unknown
speaker
you
do
--
you're
--
and
why
do
you
say
the
appellees
aren't
entitled
to
rely
on
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
here?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
bring
it
here.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
bring
it
here,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
en
banc.
en
banc,
it
had
said
that.
unknown
speaker
it's
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
in
your
jurisdiction
statements
you
list
on
page
eight,
only
one
question
--
unknown
speaker
but
--
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
court
the
court
on
its
own
motion
listed
two
questions.
unknown
speaker
you're
correct.
but
your
opponents
made
--
filed
no
cross
appeal?
unknown
speaker
when
did
washington
--
from
under
what
statute
did
washington,
rather
than
the
united
states,
have
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
committing
crimes
on
an
indian
reservation?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes
but
how
about
an
--
how
about
a
non-indian
against
an
indian?
unknown
speaker
oh,
hasn't
washington
purported
to
assume
jurisdiction
over
non-indian
crimes
against
indians?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
--
does
the
63
act
that's
involved
in
this
case
deal
with
non-indian
crimes,
non-indian
defendants
or
just
indian
defendants?
unknown
speaker
completely
and
what
act,
if
any,
deals
with
the
crimes
by
non-indians
on
indian
reservations
or
is
there
such
a
washington
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hovis,
may
i
ask
one
question.
unknown
speaker
it's
kind
of
a
broad
question
i
guess,
but
you
emphasized
only
two
felony
arrests
by
the
state.
in
the
felony
area,
isn't
it
true
that
the
replacement
was
the
state
instead
of
the
federal
authorities
and
--
since
there
wasn't
tribal
jurisdiction
anyway,
isn't
that
right?
and
so
their
grievances
--
but
isn't
it
between
the
federal
and
state
sovereigns
rather
than
as
between
the
tribe
and
the
state
on
this
portion
of
the
law
enforcement?
unknown
speaker
but
--
but
that's
--
but
they
were
17
arrests
by
federal
authorities,
not
--
we're
not
talking
about
tribal
enforcement
now,
are
we?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
are
they
disabled
from
doing
that
with
respect
to
the
states?
could
they
do
the
same
thing?
the
federal
government
had
the
responsibility
before
but
the
tribe
more
or
less
volunteered
to
help
out.
they're
prevented
from
doing
that
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
is
the
situation
in
the
major
crimes
area
really
any
basically
different
than
it
was
when
it
was
the
federal
government
that
prosecute
it?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
what
i'm
really
asking
is
how
is
it
different
than
when
he
had
the
same
question
before?
who
does
he
go
to,
the
fbi
or
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
and
can
they
do
the
same
thing
now?
that's
why
i'm
asking
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
with
that
--must
state
agrees
but
wasn't
it
true
also
when
the
federal
government
was
the
prosecutor?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
isn't
with
the
arrest
but
with
the
failure
to
prosecute
where
an
arrest
has
been
made
by
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
i
can
under
-â€“
the
thing,
i
have
trouble
with
it,
why
is
it
any
more
confusing
now
than
it
was
before,
when
it
was
the
federal
rather
than
the
state?
that's
what
puzzles
me.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
quite
--
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
--
could
i
ask
you
--
could
i
ask
you,
let's
assume
that
you
--
that
your
position
prevails
here.
then
let's
assume
there
is
a
crime
by
an
indian
on
the
reservation.
now,
if
it's
a
major
crime
under
the
major
crimes
act,
the
federal
authorities
have
to
prosecute.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
if
it
isn't
a
major
crime
but
it
isn't
a
misdemeanor
either?
isn't
there
an
assimilative
crimes
act?
unknown
speaker
and
in
which
event
do
the
federal
laws
incorporate
state
law
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
but
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about
--
let's
take
a
major
crime,
they
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
it.
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
major
crimes.
now,
what
is
the
role
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act?
unknown
speaker
where
--
that's
covered
--
that's
in
the
event
of
a
crime
that
is
not
a
major
crime.
unknown
speaker
now,
in
that
area,
the
crimes
are
defined
by
state
law,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
and
then
there's
a
third
category
of
crimes
that
are
covered
by
tribal
law.
unknown
speaker
but
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
except
in
the
eight
categories.
