mr.
claiborne,
i'm
not
sure
that
completely
answers
justice
rehnquist's
question
because
both
in
the
proviso
and
in
the
introductory
portion
of
6
is
a
reference
to
the
people
amending
the
constitution
or
statute
as
the
case
may
be.
in
both
cases,
the
word
people
would
seem
to
encompass
acts
by
the
legislature.
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
that?
i'm
not
clear
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
in
your
view
of
the
word
people
as
used
in
both
parts
of
section
6
can
refer
to
acts
by
the
legislature
without
a
popular
referendum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree
it's
the
best
you
can
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
claiborne,
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
further
question
on
the
jurisdictional
problem
that
justice
white
identified.
is
it
not
correct
that
if
we
accept
your
theory
as
opposed
to
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
will
invalidate
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
nine
tribes
who
consented
to
a
full
acceptance
of
jurisdiction,
whereas
the
rationale
of
the
ninth
circuit
would
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
just
the
1963
act
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
1957
act
with
your
present
submission
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
question
they
had
raised
is
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question
that
raises
--
does
that
affect
our
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
particular
argument.
