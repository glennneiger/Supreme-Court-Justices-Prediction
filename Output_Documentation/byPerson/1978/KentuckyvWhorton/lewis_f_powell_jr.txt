justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
fitzgerald,
are
the
judges
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
elected?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
was
the
last
election?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
there
one
in
the
fall
of
'78?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
wasn't?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
doesn't
really
follow
does
it?
even
if
it
weren't
a
none
per
se
rule,
would
it
not
still
be
wise
for
the
state
court
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
lay
down
a
per
se
rule
for
the
future
administration
of
its
own
business?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
kentucky
supreme
court
indicated
the
very
definite
interest
in
running
its
own
affairs
to
the
extent
it
could,
and
there
would
be
very
likely
to
have
played
down
a
per
se
rule
that
it
thought
was
wise
whether
it
thought
it
was
compelled
to
or
not.
