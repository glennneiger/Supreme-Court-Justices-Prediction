mr.
fitzgerald,
the
issue
in
taylor
really
was
whether
or
not
there
been
a
fair
trial
and
the
court
emphasized
a
number
of
factors
relevant
to
that
issue.
first
of
all
the
thinness
of
the
evidence,
the
prosecution
was
able
to
muster.
you
had
one
on
one
nothing
else.
but
then
the
court
emphasized
the
argument
by
the
prosecutor,
the
closing
argument
which
went
quite
far
a
field.
talked
at
length
about
the
indictment,
also
implied
that
every
defendant
was
guilty.
and
in
addition
to
that
the
basic
constructions
were
quite
skeletal.
the
court's
opinion
examined
all
of
those
factors
and
concluded
as
the
chief
justice
has
stated
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
failure
to
give
the
instruction
deprived
the
defendant
of
a
fair
trial.
do
you
detect
any
suggestion
of
a
per
se
rule
in
those
circumstances?
why
would
we
have
gone
into
those?
all
we
would
have
to
say
is
that
whenever
there
is
a
failure
to
give
that
instruction
in
clear
language
there
has
been
a
denial
of
due
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
requested.
