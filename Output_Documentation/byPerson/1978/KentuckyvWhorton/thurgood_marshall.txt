justice

marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
then
the
instruction
on
innocence
wouldn't
have
hurt
the
government
at
all,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
not
give
it?

not
to

reverse
that
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
we
touch
that
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
as
of
now,
in
kentucky
you
have
to
give
the
instruction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
is
this
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
watson
your
court
said,
in
whorton,
we
elected
as
a
matter
of
state
law
not
to
engage
in
application
of
the
harmless
error
doctrine.
we
chose
simple
prophylaxis
over
town
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
means
what,
and
that
means
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
rule
is
not
before
us.
we
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
the
rule
in
kentucky.
justice
thurgood
marshall
regardless
of
what
we
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
regardless
of
what
we
say
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
before
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
can
we
rule
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
brought
it
up.
you
brought
it
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
want
us
to
overrule
taylor,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
is
before
us?
i'm
speaking
of
this
rule
the
supreme
court
has
adopted.
doesn't
it
take
this
case
away
from
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
wouldn't
that
take
this
case
from
us?
that
says
that
this
is
the
kentucky
law.
that's
what
the
rule
says.
not
this
case.
the
rule
is
the
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
requested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
attorney
general,
can
we
decide
what
they
said
as
well
as
you
can?
you're
trying
to
tell
us
what
they
said.
we
can
read
that,
can't
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
it's
okay.
