justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
will
affect
whether
this
particular
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
respondent
remains
in
jail
or
gets
out
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
has
not
said
that
it
regards
it
as
a
per
se
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
to
fail
to
give
the
instruction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
what
you're
appealing
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wouldn't
be
the
first
instance
in
the
law
in
which
there
was
a
semantic
doubt
for
instance
in
our
bruton
case
where
we
held
that
an
implicated
defendant
could
admit
--
could
object
to
the
admission
of
a
co-defendant's
confession
against
him.
you
are
confronted
in
the
lower
courts
now
with
arguments
that
either
there
was
no
bruton
violation,
or
if
there
was
it
was
harmless
error.
and
sometimes
those
are
rather
hard
to
straighten
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
whorton
and
not
watson?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
take
a
look
at
page
22
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
penultimate
paragraph
of
the
court's
opinion
in
whorton.
do
you
think
you
can
really
reconcile
what
you
just
said
with
the
court
statement
there
that
those
of
us
in
the
majority
would
like
to
really
hold
this
newly
declared
constitutional
requirement
in
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule
where
we
are
afraid
it
might
not
stick?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
client
is
whorton
not
watson,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
that
would
still
leave
the
question
of
whether
taylor
is
a
per
se
rule
or
not,
would
it
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
rule
is
perspective
only,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
if
we
reverse
this
case
saying
that
taylor
had
not
met
what
the
supreme
court
of
--
what
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
said
it
meant,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
is
perfectly
free
to
say
that
on
remand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
the
beginning
in
page
15
of
the
petitioner's.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
the
jurors
also
given
15
witnesses
incriminating
him,
weren't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
the
sentences
concurrent
or?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
consecutive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
cases
on
direct
appeal?
