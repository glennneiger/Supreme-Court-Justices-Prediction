mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court,
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
tell
this
court
what
it
meant
by
its
language.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
will
be
glad
to
tell
you
what
i
think
it
means.
the
common
sense
of
the
matter
to
me
is
that
there
are
three
branches
to
taylor.
first
of
all,
this
court
recognized
the
vital
function
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
as
a
tool
for
the
jury
and
therefore
imposed
an
affirmative
duty
on
trial
judges
to
give
life
to
the
presumption
for
the
jury.
however,
at
the
same
time
the
court
exalted
substance
over
form
and
wisely
refrained
from
a
legislating
form
instruction
containing
magic
words.
to
me
the
operative
due
process
principle
in
taylor
is
not
that
an
instruction
containing
the
magic
words
presumption
of
innocence
must
be
conveyed
to
the
jury
in
every
case.
but
rather
in
some
manner,
the
trial
judge
must
reliably
convey
to
the
jury
the
substance
of
the
presumption.
and
on
the
particular
facts
before
the
court
in
taylor,
this
court
appears
to
me
to
have
held
that
only
an
instruction
would
have
conveyed
the
substance.
i
submit
that
the
kentucky
court
in
whorton
correctly
discerned
the
principle
which
i
have
enunciated
and
said
in
effect
as
applied
to
kentucky
cases,
this
means
that
it
will
have
to
be
given
in
every
case
because
we
pride
ourselves
on
bare-bones
instructions
which
keep
the
trial
court
from
reliably
importing
the
substance
of
the
presumption
to
the
jury
in
any
other
way.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
now
i
think
that's
the
second
branch
of
our
case
here
today.
i
merely
said
that
i
thought
in
whorton
the
court
correctly
discerned
a
general
constitutional
principle
as
a
matter
of
due
process
that
the
substance
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
should
be
conveyed
to
the
jury.
whether
it's
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule
is
a
second
question.
i'm
merely
responding
to
general
kimberlin's
notion
that
it's
not
even
a
general
due
process
principle.
i
think
it
is.
whether
it's
subject
to
exceptions
is
another
matter.
and
i
think
the
court
said
“we're
uncertain
about
exceptions
and
we're
afraid
that
if
we
make
an
exception
it
might
not
stick.”
the
court
then
went
on
in
watson
to
elaborate
on
that
fear
and
to
explain
that
part
of
that
fear
is
not
based
on
a
notion
that
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
think
that
i'm
not
here
to
defend
the
language
of
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky,
but
i
think
the
result
was
correct.
if
we
look
beyond
the
words
to
the
substance
of
what
they
did,
they
first
of
all
discerned
it
to
be
i
think
correctly
a
general
due
process
requirement.
they
discerned
that
it
was
unclear
whether
there
might
be
exceptions
and
whether
than
play
constitutional
roulette,
they
did
two
things.
one,
they
reversed
all
pending
cases.
secondly,
they
adopted
a
state
rule
governing
all
future
cases,
and
actually
then
thirdly,
they
elucidated
in
watson
that
part
of
their
reason
for
doing
this
was
state
law
they
didn't
want
to
engage
in
the
mental
gymnastics.
that
is
not
entirely
clear
from
the
language
of
whorton
itself.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
it
would
appear
so
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
--
if
the
whorton
case
were
taken
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
--
on
its
own.
but
when
you
couple
with
that
the
adoption
of
a
rule
of
state
law
which
they
noted
in
the
footnote
they
were
doing
simultaneously,
i
suggest
that
their
motivations
although
not
clearly
enunciated
may
have
been
both.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
that
is
correct.
but
i
would
submit
that
even
if
whorton
had
solely
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
we
hold
that
we
can
not
apply
the
harmless
error
standard.
if
the
court
has
subsequently
said
and
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law
that
we
choose
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
--
not
to
do
so
that
this
court
should
not
involve
itself
in
the
state
process.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes,
i
think
so.
however,
if
you
read
the
reluctance
as
i
think
justice
white
pointed
out
so
graphically
during
general
kimberlin's
remarks.
if
you
will
read
their
reluctance
to
engage
in
the
mental
gymnastics
of
applying
the
harmless
error
rule
after
the
fact,
i
think
we
can
see
they
would
have
the
same
reluctance
to
apply
them
before
the
fact
to
an
exceptional
cases
doctrine.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
my
own
reading
of
taylor,
again,
i
profess
a
little
if
any
clairvoyance
when
it
comes
to
the
minds
of
the
members
of
this
court
is
that
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
what
i'm
saying
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
when
you
read
those
words
as
i
said
earlier
with
the
earlier
statements
in
the
opinion
that
the
judge
has
a
duty
to
ensure
that
the
jury
understands
the
substance
of
it
then
it
may
be
a
case
by
case
question
of
whether
these
exact
words
need
to
be
conveyed.
but
the
due
process
requirement
is
that
in
some
manner
the
jury
must
be
informed
of
the
operative
principles
by
which
it
must
decide
a
case.
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
so
vital
that
the
jury
can
not
be
trusted
to
reliably
apply
the
correct
standards
to
weighing
evidence
unless
it
is
informed.
now
whether
these
particular
words
or
some
other
words
may
satisfy
that
i
think
the
opinion
says
might
be
left
to
a
case
by
case
determination.
or
might
be
left
open
for
future
consideration
of
whether
there
is
a
harmless
error
standard.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
general
kimberlin
has
contended
that
because
it
does
not
apply
to
the
cases
pending
at
the
time
it
was
adopted
that
those
cases
are
still
before
you.
and
i
suppose
to
some
extent,
he
is
correct.
but
i
think
the
importance
of
that
rule
is
that
it
shows
the
state's
reluctance
not
only
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
holding,
but
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
get
involved
in
this
kind
of
case
by
case
analysis.
it
shows
a
preference
for
prophylaxis
and
that
preference
is
indicated
i
think
as
a
certain
thing
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
the
opinion
in
watson
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes,
it
will.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
that
is
correct,
absolutely.
everyone
of
these
will
get
the
form
instruction
under
rcr
9.56
from
the
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
including
this
one.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
as
i
said
earlier
and
i
think
this
court
knows
better
than
i
from
its
language
in
taylor
and
estelle,
more
than
originally
thought,
more
than
mere
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
accused.
if
it
were
mere
evidence
the
jury
could
disregard
it.
it
is
rather
a
guiding
operative
principle
by
which
the
jury
weighs
the
evidence,
and
as
justice
wilhoit
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
noted
in
his
dissent
in
taylor
before
it
ever
got
to
this
court
that
presumption
is
probably
contrary
to
the
mindset
of
many
of
the
jurors.
and
they
probably
entertain
a
presumption
of
guilt
by
the
time
they
go
into
that
jury
room
after
having
heard
the
indictment
read,
or
even
as
they
entered
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
don't
recall
that.
i
believe
there
it
--
i've
seen
something
to
that
effect
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
--
but
i
don't
recall
where.
but
i
think
that
underscores
the
dramatic
need
for
the
presumption
of
innocence.
the
operative
principle
has
no
life
unless
each
and
every
juror
understands
it
clearly
and
applies
it
correctly
in
the
decision
of
a
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
this
court
was
saying
in
taylor
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
this
would
i
think
underscore
what
this
court
recognized
in
taylor
and
williams
that
not
only
must
the
jury
be
made
aware
of
the
presumption,
but
they
must
be
made
aware
reliably
by
the
trial
judge.
no
amount
of
argument,
no
amount
of
persuasion
can
carry
with
it
the
weight
which
the
state
attaches
to
that
presumption
as
an
operative
principle
to
guide
them
in
weighing
facts
during
the
fact-finding
process.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
think
you
can
dismiss
for
mootness
in
light
of
the
language
in
watson
that
they
would
not
want
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
mental
gymnastics
on
the
front
end
anymore
than
they
would
on
the
back
end.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
it's
the
same
process.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
if
this
court
feels
that
taylor
is
strictly
an
exceptional
circumstances
cases
that
certainly
is
a
remedy
available
to
the
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
think
that
the
circumstance
of
the
kentucky
court's
explanation
of
its
unwillingness
to
get
into
a
case
by
case
approach
and
the
adoption
of
the
rule
would
still
justify
this
court
in
upholding
the
decision
in
whorton
as
--
and
mooting
this
case.
i
think
it's
much
more
likely,
much
more
stronger
case
to
moot
if
we
are
talking
about
a
general
principle
subject
to
harmless
--
possible
harmless
error
exception.
but
the
circumstances
of
the
kentucky
courts
action
summarily
reversing
all
pending
cases
prospectively
imposing
a
mandatory
duty
in
all
future
cases,
and
then
in
watson
explaining
what
it
has
done
as
being
as
a
reluctance
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
get
into
case
by
case
evaluation
would
indicate
that
the
kentucky
court
would
do
no
differently
on
remand
than
it
did
before.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
believe
that
unless
this
court
over
rules
taylor
that
the
kentucky
court
will
continue
to
prefer
the
prophylaxis
to
case
by
case
matters.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes,
i'm
confident
about
it.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
surely.
surely
they
are.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
that's
true,
it
could
do
that.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes,
they
are.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
believe
the
elections
are
staggered.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
no.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
take
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
--
taylor
to
mean
and
perhaps
wrongly
from
what
you're
saying
that
the
trial
judge
has
a
duty
to
ensure
that
the
substance
of
the
presumption
is
conveyed
to
the
jury
in
some
manner.
and
the
reason
that
these
factors
were
going
into
and
impress
me
was
to
see
whether
or
not
it
had
to
be
done
in
this
particular
manner
with
this
particular
instruction.
in
kentucky,
the
same
skeletal
instructions
had
been
given
from
time
immemorial
and
indeed
the
opinion
in
whorton
considers
this
court's
criticism
of
those
instructions
as
a
complement.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes
that
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
think
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
think
it
at
least
leaves
open
that
possibility.
i
read
the
decision
myself,
quite
frankly
as
leaving
for
future
determination
whether
or
not
there
might
be
a
different
result.
to
qualify,
it
is
not
uncommon
in
my
experience
for
a
court
to
qualify
its
result
and
leave
open
for
future
consideration
on
a
better
record
with
perhaps
more
experiential
data
from
different
states
or
jurisdictions
which
have
experimented
with
the
rule
whether
or
not
there
are
exceptions.
i
could
take
that
language
to
mean
there
are
exceptions
or
i
can
take
it
as
i
did
in
fact
that
will
lead
open
for
a
future
date
discussion
of
whether
there
are
exceptions.
but
in
so
far
as
we're
stressing
the
similarities
between
this
case
and
the
dissimilarities
between
this
case
and
taylor,
let
me
point
out
that
in
this
case,
the
same
skeletal
instructions
were
given.
they
do
not
convey
to
the
jury,
the
presumption
of
innocence.
they
do
not
dispel
the
notion
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
pointed
out
that
perhaps
some
37%
of
them
may
have
had
that
he
is
presumed
guilty.
what
difference
does
that
make
you
may
ask
with
so
many
witnesses?
i
suggest
that
the
complex
nature
of
this
case,
and
the
fact
that
the
jury
is
being
asked
to
determine
15
or
more
charges
rather
than
one
or
two
makes
it
very
difficult
for
the
jury
to
sort
out
and
to
discriminate.
he
might
be
guilty
of
12
of
them
and
not
guilty
of
the
other
three.
and
yet
the
inevitable
tendency
if
the
jury
starts
out
with
the
presumption
of
guilt
is
to
say
“well
let's
see,
was
he
there?”
“yes
he
was
there.”
“let's
go
ahead
and
find
him
guilty
on
all
of
them
and
impose
the
maximum
penalty
in
all
of
them”
which
is
exactly
what
they
did.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
the
instructions
tendered
by
the
defense
and
not
given
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
oh!
they
begin
on
page
18.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
and
they
go
on
counting
the
form
verdicts
all
the
way
over
to
page
40.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
22
pages
that
the
jury
had
to
sift
through.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
all
right.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
none.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
except
the
instruction,
the
standard
kentucky
instruction
that
was
given
in
taylor
which
is
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
alright.
page
30.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes,
in
the
middle
of
page
30
instruction
number
xviii.
“if
upon
the
whole
case
you
have
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
defendant's
guilt,
you
shall
find
him
not
guilty.
the
term
reasonable
doubt
means
a
substantial
doubt
or
reasonable
doubt
--
i
mean
a
real
doubt.
and
that
you
must
ask
yourself
not
whether
a
better
case
might
have
been
proven
but
whether
after
hearing
all
the
evidence,
you
actually
doubt
the
defendant
as
guilty.”
this
is
the
only
instruction
that
kentucky
has
permitted
for
years.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
nothing
whatsoever.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
exactly
in
that
respect.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
except
that
instead
of
a
close
--
excuse
me.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
you
mean
by
the
court?
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
do
not
recall
whether
there
was
any
by
counsel.
i'm
confident
that
there
was
not
by
the
court.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
do
not
recall.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes
--
no,
excuse
me,
the
judge
reads
the
instructions
to
the
jury,
the
attorneys
then
have
to
go
from
the
instructions.
the
instructions
contain
the
whole
of
the
case
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
presumably
so,
yes.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
well
what
i'm
saying
is
that's
not
contrary
to
the
instructions
but
neither
does
it
carry
the
weight
of
the
court
behind
it.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
if
i
were
to
argue
there's
a
presumption
of
innocence,
and
i
sit
down
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
no,
someone
else
from
our
office
tried
it.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
i
believe
he
did
discuss
it
in
the
closing
argument.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
to
what
extent
i
don't
recall.
i
did
not
consider
that
to
be
really
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes,
and
not
only
that,
the
written
instructions
are
carried
in
to
the
jury
room
so
that
long
after
the
arguments
of
counsel
have
seized
to
ring
in
the
jurors
ears,
all
that
remains
is
the
truncated
reasonable
doubt
instruction.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
if
they
do,
and
12
or
13
pages
of
instructions
to
sift
through
without
one
mention
of
the
presumption
of
innocence.
now,
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
the
defendant
relied
more
heavily
than
most
on
the
presumption
on
this
case.
he
wanted
bifurcated
trials
on
guilt
and
penalty,
because
in
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
that's
about
all
he
had
going
for
him
exactly.
he
relied
very
heavily
upon
it.
he
had
an
alibi
to
one
or
two
of
the
robberies
that
he
wanted
to
put
on,
but
to
do
that
he
would've
had
to
testify
in
a
joined
trial
as
to
all
three
robberies.
so
he
chose
--
he
had
an
election
to
stand
upon
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent,
and
to
count
on
the
presumption
to
carry
him
through
on
those
two
other
robberies.
and
yet,
he
got
no
benefit
from
the
presumption
because
the
jury
was
never
told
of
it.
instead
they
were
given
confusing
lengthy
instructions
containing
the
same
kind
of
skeletal
reasonable
doubt
instruction,
and
they
went
back
and
found
him
guilty
not
of
some
other
robberies,
not
discriminating
from
one
to
the
other
but
of
every
single
count
and
imposed
the
maximum
penalty
on
every
single
one.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
now,
10
of
those
witnesses
applied
to
one
robbery,
the
other
--
the
other
two
robberies
did
not
have
that
kind
of
that
volume
of
evidence
that
in
all
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
no,
they
were
all
consecutive.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
totaling
230
years.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
that's
correct.
they
are
read
to
the
jury
orally.
the
lawyers
may
refer
to
them
in
their
arguments
and
they're
taken
back
to
the
jury
room.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
the
same
as
was
in
taylor,
it's
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
--
instruction
number
xviii
on
page
30.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
“if
upon
the
whole
case,
you
have
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
defendant's
guilt,
you
shall
find
him
not
guilty.”
the
term
reasonable
doubt
is
used
in
these
instructions
means
the
substantial
doubt
or
real
doubt,
and
that
you
must
ask
yourself
not
whether
a
better
case
might
have
been
proven,
but
whether
after
hearing
all
the
evidence
you
actually
doubt
that
the
defendant
is
guilty.
i
submit
this
does
not
in
any
shape
manner
or
form
convey
to
the
jury
that
presumption
of
innocence
in
its
substance
but
rather
the
opposite
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
no.
under
kentucky
law
--
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
yes.
there
is
no
other
kind
of
general
instruction
on
burden
of
proof,
reasonable
doubt
or
any
of
these
matters
in
kentucky.
this
is
the
bare-bones
upon
which
the
kentucky
court
has
prodded
itself
for
years.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
15
pages
of
instructions
on
the
substantive
offense.
none,
except
for
this
one
paragraph,
on
the
function
of
the
jury
the
process
which
it
must
use
in
weighing
the
evidence
under
these
15
instructions.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
that's
the
skeletal
part.
in
conclusion,
it's
our
position
that
this
court
said
in
taylor
that
due
process
of
law
requires
the
trial
judge
to
take
some
kind
of
action
to
ensure
that
every
criminal
jury
is
guided
by
the
presumption
of
innocence
during
the
fact
finding
process.
if
the
court
didn't
says
that
in
taylor
then
we
would
urge
that
the
court
should
say
it
now,
because
the
many
states
which
have
considered
this
proposition
have
increasingly
in
recent
years
tended
in
that
direction.
the
reason
is
that
it's
an
operative
principle
to
guide
the
jury
and
it
has
no
life
whatsoever,
unless
the
jury
is
reliably
informed
of
it.
the
only
person
in
a
position
to
reliably
perform
this
duty
is
the
trial
judge.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
at
the
present
time,
i
don't
think
this
was
true
at
the
time
whorton
was
tried
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky.
there
is
a
jury
pool
and
there
is
a
film
presented
by
the
bar
association
which
conveys
the
sort
of
thing
to
the
jury
--
to
the
jury
panel.
i
don't
believe
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
that
whorton
was
tried.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
as
a
matter
of
fact,
practice
was
very
sporadic.
we
had
a
series
of
litigation
against
this
particular
judge
for
holding
locked-door
sessions
with
jurors
at
the
beginning
of
their
term
when
we
couldn't
tell
what
he
had
said
to
them.
i
don't
think
that
was
true
of
this
particular
panel.
but
the
practice
was
very,
very
sporadic
particularly
with
this
judge.
i
had
no
indication
that
he
said
anything
to
this
particular
panel
one
way
or
the
other
at
the
beginning
of
their
term
of
service.
mr.
terrence
r.
fitzgerald
has
the
reference
yes.
