he
can
be
questioned
or
you
don't
want
to
question

or
you
can

but
unless
you
--

and
unless

you

whatever

justice

when
requested?
justice

and
then
at
the
end
it
says
“if
we're
wrong,
we
shall
welcome
further
enlightenment

the

that
seems

which
i
presume
is
(inaudible)
for
saying
the
supreme
court,
which
would
certainly
imply
that
this
is
not
a
rule
of
state
law,
if
the
answer
to
the
question
lies
here.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
is
not.
in
fact
the
language
of
whorton
itself
particularly
in
the
sentence
that
i
just
read
implies
quite
the
contrary
that
the
answer
to
whether
or
not
there's
a
harmless
error
rule
lies
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
that's
certainly
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
saying
that
it's
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
on
its
own.
justice
potter
stewart
not
to.
justice
potter
stewart
we
can't.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
retrials?
there
are
some
40
or
50
cases
we
were
told
by
the
general
that
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
there
has
or
predictably
will
reverse
convictions
that
will
be
reversed
by
that
court
for
a
new
trial.
now
will
the
rule
be
applicable
to
the
new
trials
by
its
terms?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
will
be
applicable
to
these
cases
if
they're
tried
again.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
somewhere
in
these
papers
in
one
of
the
separate
opinions
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court
reference
to
a
study
that
indicates
that
37%
of
the
population
thinks
that
the
rule
of
law
is
that
a
person
is
guilty
until
he
proves
himself
innocent?
isn't
that
in
here
somewhere?
didn't
i
see
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
can't
find
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
in
justice
clayton's
dissenting
opinion
on
page
33
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
footnote.
according
to
a
comprehensive
national
survey
conducted
by
the
national
center
for
state
courts,
the
actual
figure
is
37%
and
that
stands
for
--
that
figure
is
over
a
third
of
all
americans
believe
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
accused
to
prove
his
or
her
innocence.
that's
what
i
was
thought
i'd
remember
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
taylor.
justice
potter
stewart
the
instructions
actually
given
are
--
appear
on
beginning
on
page
18
of
the
appendix,
those
were
actually
given?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
are
the
instructions
on
presumption
of
innocence
and
reasonable
doubt
that
were
actually
given?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
i'm
talking
about
the
ones
actually
given
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
on
page
18.
justice
potter
stewart
or,
31
anyway.
justice
potter
stewart
well
31
are
the
actual
instructions.
justice
potter
stewart
18
to
31,
and
where
if
you
know
and
don't
waste
your
time
if
you
don't,
in
here
are
the
instructions
actually
given
as
to
presumption
of
innocence
and
reasonable
doubt.
justice
potter
stewart
zero?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
say
none
except,
so
what?
that
means
there
were
some
and
where
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
page
30?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
nothing
except
beyond
that
at
least
as
to
presumption
of
innocence?
justice
potter
stewart
nothing.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
in
closing
argument?
i
guess
there
wasn't
here.
how
about
closing
argument
by
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
about
all
he
had
going
for
him,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
in
kentucky
the
judge's
instructions
go
in
written
form
to
the
jury
when
it
begins
to
deliberate?
justice
potter
stewart
in
writing?
justice
potter
stewart
instruction
number
18.
justice
potter
stewart
if
upon
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
there
something
else
in
these
instructions
about
whose
burden
it
is
to
present
evidence
--
to
make
the
--
to
present
the
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
so.
justice
potter
stewart
except
that
each
one
of
the
instruction
says
they
must
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
