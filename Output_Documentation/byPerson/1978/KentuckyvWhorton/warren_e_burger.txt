chief

e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
kentucky
against
whorton.
mr.
kimberlin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
kentucky
court
has
simply
announced
a
prospective
ruling.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
kimberlin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fitzgerald.
is
there
any
question
about
it
that
the
taylor
case
was
emphasized
that
it
was
decided
on
the
facts
of
that
case,
and
that
it
disclaimed
laying
down
a
per
se
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
want
to
know
what
you
know,
what
you
think
it
meant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
did
not,
i
repeat
the
question.
did
not
the
dispositive
paragraph,
second
from
the
last
sentence
in
taylor,
make
it
clear
that
it's
a
case
by
case
decision
not
a
per
se
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
not
asking
about
the
minds
of
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
referring
to
you,
when
you
read
those
words
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
that
language
that
justice
--
mr.
justice
powell
just
repeated
to
you
indicate
that
there
might
be
a
different
result
when
you
have
15
eyewitnesses
and
no
contrary,
no
contradiction
on
those
eyewitnesses
that
was
enough
to
shake
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here
you
had
only
one
alibi
witness.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
his
wife
said
he
was
home,
15
other
people
said
he
was
in
the
store
with
a
gun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
taylor,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
it
say
about
reasonable
doubt
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
fitzgerald.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
kimberlin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh
yes,
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
by
the
time
the
case
--
by
the
time
the
case
comes
to
the
supreme
court,
your
first
terminology
was
correct
is,
he
stands
convicted
when
he
comes
with
a
conviction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
