justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
an
order
by
an
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
copy
of
the
order
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
the
copy
of
the
watson
decision
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
info
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
don't
you
--
is
it
your
basic
submission
that
whorton
is
not
--
that
taylor
was
not
a
per
se
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
yes
but
don't
you
think
--
aren't
you
really
arguing
that
taylor
only
applies
where
you
couldn't
define
harmless
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there's
no
prejudice
there's
no
error
under
your
reading
at
taylor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
the
sense
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
taylor
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
that
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
and
do
you
think
that's
any
different
from
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
do
you
think
that's
any
different
from
saying
that
you
must
give
the
instruction
where
you
couldn't
hold
that
it
would
be
harmless
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
--
harmless
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
once
you
decide
that
the
taylor
rule
applies,
there
couldn't
possibly
be
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
if
there's
some
possibility
of
harm,
there
couldn't
be
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
said
that
if
your
kentucky
court
had
said
“well,
as
we
understand
taylor
it's
not
a
per
se
rule,
it's
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
you
do
it
from
case
to
case.
you
have
to
figure
out
whether
there's
some
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
any
real
need
to
give
this
instruction.
well
that's
just
a
lot
of
mental
gymnastics.
we're
just
not
going
to
do
that.
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
we're
going
to
say
that
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
wants
to
inject
this
kind
of
confusion
in
the
state
trials,
we're
going
to
clear
it
all
up
by
as
a
matter
of
state
law
making
it
a
per
se
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law
then,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
here
wharton
it
said
in
this
paragraph
i'm
talking
about,
it
says,
“yet
taylor
contains
no
hint
that
it
might
have
been
appropriate
to
consider
whether
the
error
was
in
fact
prejudice
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
don't
think
we
can,
can
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
were
retried.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
should
we
do
with
this
case
if
we
say
the
kentucky
court
was
wrong
with
respect
to
taylor
that
it
wasn't
a
per
se
rule?
it
was
an
exceptional
circumstances
or
ad
hoc
due
process
case.
should
we
just
diverse
then
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
we
can
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
they
could
--
they
can
say
that
again,
but
we're
talking
about
this
case
not
watson.
and
it
--
why
wouldn't
we
just
say
reverse
or
at
least
vacate
and
say
“here's
what
whorton
meant”
or
at
least
maybe
we
can't
say
what
it
meant
but
we
can
tell
you
that
whorton
didn't
mean
what
you
said
it
meant.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
taylor.
taylor
didn't
mean
what
you
said
it
meant.
anyway,
and
now
you
can
do
about
what
you
want
to
or
is
it
a
matter
of
local
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
available
but
is
that
what
we
--
let's
just
assume
that
that's
what
we
would
hold
with
respect
to
taylor.
what
would
you
then
argue
we
should
do
with
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it
what
you
then
would
are
quite
sure
in
your
own
mind,
at
least
you
would
argue
that
even
if
no
matter
what
we
said
about
taylor,
if
we
said
this
is
not
a
per
se
case,
the
kentucky
court
would
still
leave
its
mandatory
instruction
rule
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
rather
have
a
--
would
rather
have
a
black
or
white
situation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
than
a
case
by
case
argument
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
could
say
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
we
just
don't
want
this
uncertainty
we're
going
to
leave
our
rule
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
like
taylor
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
argue
before
the
judge's
instructions
in
kentucky?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
free
--
would
you
be
free
to
argue
a
presumption
of
innocence
if
the
judge
hadn't
instructed
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why?
you
just
said
you
were
bound
by
the
instruction.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
did
you
try
this
case
or
did
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know
whether
he
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
presumption
of
innocence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
unless
taylor
is
a
totality
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
--
but
you
say
that
it's
the
judge
that
must
get
it
across
to
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
hope
they
ring
there
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
15
pages
of
skeletal
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
jury
comes
in,
in
a
kentucky
criminal
trial
does
the
judge
give
him
a
little
talk
first
before
the
trial
starts
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
judge
never
said
a
word
to
him
except
“good
morning
ladies
and
gentlemen”?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
every
single
instruction
had
the
reasonable
doubt
reference
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
prediction
is
that
a
plea
reversed
and
said
taylor
is
a
totality
case
depending
on
the
circumstances
and
their
ultimate
issue
being
whether
there's
a
fair
trial
in
the
particular
case,
as
my
brother
powell
says?
that
the
kentucky
court
would
probably
revoke
this
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
list
of
the
--
i
take
it
you
have
list
of
the
cases
that
might
be
affected,
the
past
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
want
the
list,
but
what's
the
oldest
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
are
there
a
lot
of
other
cases
that
might
come
up
on
collateral
attack?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
only
talking
now
about
“x”
number
that
are
on
direct
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
may
be
a
lot
of
cases
that
will
be
subject
to
state
and
then
federal
collateral
attack.
