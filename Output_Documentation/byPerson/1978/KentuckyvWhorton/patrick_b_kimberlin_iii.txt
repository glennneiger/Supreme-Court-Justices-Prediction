mr.

b.

thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
patrick
kimberlin,
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
and
it
is
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
which
is
the
petitioner
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
facts
of
this
case
stated
briefly
are
as
follows.
on
may
the
16th
1976,
in
the
evening
hours
in
suburbs
of
louisville,
kentucky
the
respondent,
harold
whorton
entered
a
fast
food
restaurant
armed
with
a
pistol
and
a
knife,
and
robbed
that
restaurant,
the
employees,
and
he
took
money
from
the
cash
register.
and
while
he
was
there,
he
took
the
knife
and
cut
the
telephone
lines.
he
then
left
the
restaurant,
fled
the
scene
in
a
1967
blue
oldsmobile.
seven
days
later
on
the
23rd
of
may,
he
committed
yet
another
robbery
again
in
the
evening
hours,
again
in
the
suburbs
of
louisville,
again
a
fast
food
restaurant.
again
armed
with
a
knife
and
a
pistol
and
he
robbed
that
restaurant
taking
money
from
the
cash
register
and
fled
the
scene.
finally,
again
seven
days
later
on
june
the
1st
1976
he
robbed
the
last
fast
food
again
in
the
suburbs
of
louisville,
kentucky
in
the
evening
hours.
again
he
pulled
the
--
this
time
he
pulled
the
telephone
from
the
wall,
fired
a
shot
into
the
ceiling
and
robbed
a
number
of
patrons
of
the
restaurant
as
well
as
the
employees,
and
again
took
money
from
the
cash
register.
however,
during
the
course
of
this
final
robbery,
one
of
the
patrons
managed
to
slip
away
and
advised
the
police
of
what
was
happening.
just
as
harold
whorton
was
fleeing
the
scene,
the
police
arrived
and
gave
chase.
in
a
short
while,
they
forced
whorton
off
the
road.
the
car
he
was
in
was
a
blue
‘67
oldsmobile.
he
got
out
off
the
car,
flourished
a
weapon
but
dropped
it
at
the
command
of
the
police.
the
police
seized
him,
the
weapon
and
some
money
from
the
automobile
and
returned
him
immediately
to
the
scene
at
that
last
robbery
where
10
individuals
who
had
been
at
that
fast
food
restaurant
positively
identified
him
as
the
man
who
just
victimized
them.
thereafter,
in
the
jefferson
county
grand
jury
returned
three
separate
indictments
one
for
each
of
these
three
robberies.
these
indictments
were
joined
for
trial
and
the
trial
was
held
in
the
jefferson
circuit
court
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky
in
september
1977.
during
the
course
of
that
trial,
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
introduced
an
abundance
of
evidence
establishing
the
guilt
of
harold
whorton
on
the
charges
that
were
brought
against
him.
at
the
--
the
evidence
presented
by
whorton
was
only
that
of
his
sister
and
his
wife.
those
two
ladies
testified
that
on
the
evening
of
one
of
the
three
robberies,
he
was
with
them,
thus
attempting
to
establish
an
alibi.
harold
whorton
did
not
take
the
stand
to
testify
in
his
own
defense.
the
conclusion
of
all
the
evidence,
harold
whorton
requested
an
instruction
on
presumption
of
innocence.
the
trial
court
refused
the
requested
instruction
as
per
the
law
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
at
that
time.
the
jury
returned
verdicts
finding
harold
whorton
guilty
on
10
counts
of
first-degree
robbery,
two
counts
of
attempt
to
commit
first-degree
robbery,
and
two
counts
of
wanton
endangerment.
whorton,
thereafter,
pursued
an
appeal
to
the
kentucky
supreme
court.
while
that
appeal
was
spinning
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court,
this
court
rendered
its
decision
on
may
30,
1978
in
the
case
of
taylor
versus
kentucky.
seven
days
later,
argument
was
heard
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court
on
the
case
at
bar,
whorton
versus
commonwealth.
the
taylor
case
was
before
the
kentucky
supreme
court
at
the
time
of
the
oral
argument
and
they
considered
that
course
at
great
length
in
the
body
of
their
opinion
which
was
rendered
on
--
i
believe
on
june
25th
of
1978.
the
opinion
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
resulted
in
the
reversal
of
all
14
charges.
two
of
the
charges,
the
wanton
endangerment
charges
were
reversed
upon
double
jeopardy
grounds.
however,
all
the
10
first-degree
robbery
charges
as
well
as
the
two
attempted
first-degree
robbery
charges
were
reversed
upon
the
ground
of
the
interpretation
given
by
the
kentucky
supreme
court
to
this
court's
opinion
in
taylor
versus
kentucky.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
interpreted
taylor
versus
kentucky
to
mean
that
a
newly
declared
constitutional
requirement
had
been
created
by
this
court
in
taylor,
and
at
that
newly
declared
constitutional
requirement
was
at
the
presumption
of
innocence
when
an
instruction
is
requested
on
the
presumption
of
innocence,
it
must
be
given.
if
the
request
is
rejected
by
the
trial
court,
it's
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
and
reversal
must
be
had.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
majority
opinion
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court,
it
would
appear
that
an
open
invitation
was
given
for
review
if
that
interpretation
that
the
kentucky
supreme
court
gave
to
taylor
meant
anything
other
than
what
the
kentucky
supreme
court
saw
it
to
be.
as
a
consequence
of
this
interpretation,
we
feel
that
there
has
been
a
serious
hindrance
of
the
criminal
--
effective
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
kentucky
because
as
of
this
time
we
now
have
50
cases
which
will
be
automatically
reversed
as
a
consequence
of
the
decision
in
whorton,
and
the
interpretation
it
gave
to
the
taylor
case.
all
these
cases,
many
of
them
are
already
reversed
or
in
stages
of
will
be
reversed.
the
majority
of
them
have
been
reversed.
in
addition
to
this
case
which
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted
here
on
january
the
8th,
we
have
four
other
cases
pending
right
now
on
petition
for
certiorari
that
have
already
reached
this
court.
our
argument
is
twofold.
the
first
is
that
it
is
our
belief
that
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
taylor
versus
kentucky
means
that
the
taylor
decision
is
limited
to
its
own
facts
and
is
of
narrow
application
and
does
not
create
a
per
se
constitutional
rule
requiring
automatic
reversal
on
due
process
grounds
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
a
presumption
of
innocence
instruction
was
requested
and
then
refused
by
the
trial
court.
we
feel
that
the
interpretation
that
should
be
given
to
the
taylor
case
is
that
constitutional
error
may
occur
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
and
the
true
constitutional
principle
involved
in
taylor
is
not
the
giving
or
not
giving
in
a
mandatory
sense
of
a
presumption
of
innocence
instruction.
but
the
principle
that
is
constitutionally
protected
then
in
accusing
a
criminal
can
be
tried
only
on
the
basis
of
probative
evidence
actually
adduced
at
trial
and
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
it
is
this
principle
which
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
invoked
by
this
court
we
believe
in
the
taylor
case
in
order
to
ensure
in
effect
a
fair
and
reasonable
trial
in
the
taylor
case,
and
as
we
know
of
course
what
happened
in
the
taylor
case
was
during
the
course
of
that
trial,
many
numerous
extraneous
negative
circumstances
arouse,
extraneous
from
the
evidence
that
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
from
the
evidence.
comments
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
his
opening
statement
with
respect
to
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
an
indictment
which
was
read
to
the
jury.
comments
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
his
summation
with
respect
to
equating
the
status
of
a
defendant
with
that
of
guilt.
and
then
all
the
defendants
who
are
brought
to
the
bar
are
guilty.
these
--
there
are
numerous
comments
to
this
effect.
given
the
circumstances
of
the
taylor
case,
the
petitioner
who
was
taylor
in
that
case,
urged
that
under
these
particular
circumstances
in
taylor,
the
presumption
of
innocence
instruction
which
was
requested
should've
been
given
in
order
to
protect
the
principle
that
a
man
is
to
be
tried
only
upon
the
basis
of
the
evidence
adduced
at
trial.
and
of
course
this
court
noted
in
the
taylor
case
that
the
purpose
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
instruction
is
to
protect
the
principle
that
a
man
is
only
to
be
--
that
a
man
is
to
be
found
guilty
only
on
the
basis
of
the
proof
adduced
at
trial
in
no
extraneous
matters.
as
i
think
also
if
we
go
to
the
case
of
estelle
versus
williams
where
this
court
noted
in
that
case
that
a
presumption
of
innocence
serves
the
purpose
of
--
its
purpose
is
twofold.
one
is
to
show
that
--
remind
the
jury
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
with
the
government
and
it
must
carry
its
burden
of
persuasion
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
and
secondly,
that
it
has
a
purging
effect
to
--
it
can
forestall
the
consideration
by
the
jury
of
extraneous
matters.
it
was
the
purging
effect
which
this
court
i
believe
felt
that
was
so
important
in
the
taylor
case.
it
was
necessary
to
purge
some
of
the
--
or
all
of
the
extraneous
matters
which
arose
during
the
course
of
that
trial.
we
submit
that
if
there
are
no
extraneous
matters
occurring
during
the
course
of
the
trial
upon
which
the
jury
could
improperly
base
or
assume
the
guilt
of
the
accused.
and
if
their
verdict
is
based
solely
upon
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt,
properly
is
presented
at
trial,
the
no
constitutional
error
occurs.
that
given
certain
circumstances
as
in
taylor,
given
the
degree
of
negative
circumstances
as
in
taylor,
an
accumulative
effect
of
those
negative
circumstances
they
can
pyramid
one
on
top
of
the
other
until
there
can
be
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
in
the
absence
of
an
instruction
on
presumption
of
innocence.
however,
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
the
absence
of
the
negative
circumstances,
there
is
no
constitutional
mandate
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
instruction
as
a
per
se
rule
is
required.
thus,
we
submit
that
in
this
case
there
was
no
violation
of
any
constitutional
standard
simply
because
we
do
not
have
in
comparison
of
the
facts
of
this
case
to
those
in
the
taylor
case
the
type
of
improper
comments
made
by
the
prosecutor
throughout
the
trial.
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
we
have
a
mere
swearing
contest
between
two
witnesses
as
in
taylor.
the
victim
there
testified
was
the
only
person
who
testified.
the
defendant
testified
was
the
only
person
who
testified
for
the
defense.
here,
we
have
15
different
witnesses
who
positively
identified
the
accused
as
the
man
who
victimized
them
on
these
three
separate
occasions.
we
have
the
testimony
of
police
officers
who
gave
chase
and
apprehended
him
first
from
the
scene.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
correct.
it
would
not
have
hurt
the
government
at
all
justice
marshall
whether
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well
in
fact
interesting
enough
justice
marshall,
the
day
after
the
oral
argument
was
heard
by
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
this
case,
that
court
amended
kentucky
rule
criminal
procedure
9.56
and
now
requires
a
presumption
of
innocence
instruction.
there
would
be
absolutely
no
harm
i
don't
feel
it
would
have
done
to
the
government's
case.
i
agree
with
you
there.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
this
is
by
act
of
the
court,
your
honor,
justice
white.
our
court
can
amend
its
own
rules
--
its
criminal
rules
and
it
has
done
so
in
this
case.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
not
the
order
but
the
amended
rule
is
a
part
of
the
brief
in
our
case
and
it
is
in
one
of
the
footnotes.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well
before
this
court
it's
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor,
before
this
court
is
this
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well
that
order
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
justice
marshall
that
order
became
effective
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
no,
but
that
order
doesn't
affect
this
case.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
right,
your
honor.
the
order
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
because
that
order
does
not
affect
this
case
nor
does
it
affect
the
other
49
or
50
cases
which
were
reversed
before
that
order
ever
went
into
effect.
there's
no
retroactive
effect
to
that
order.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
your
honor
it
is
made
part
of
the
reply
brief
filed
by
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
in
its
status.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
entire
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor
i'm
fully
aware
of
what
that
opinion
says.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that
brings
us
to
the
second
aspect
of
this
case.
the
underpinning
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court's
decision
in
whorton
case
is
that
this
court
created
a
constitutional
requirement
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
due
process
clause
that
a
presumption
of
innocence
instruction
must
be
given
as
a
per
se
matter
regardless
of
facts
and
circumstances
or
anything
else.
and
if
the
instruction
itself
when
requested
is
not
given
then
it's
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
the
underpinning
of
the
whorton
decision
and
because
of
that
decision.
these
other
50
cases
have
been
automatically
reversed.
and
if
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
the
taylor
case,
if
that's
what
the
proposition
that
taylor
stands
for
then
we
are
wrong
and
we
would
candidly
admit
it
if
that
is
what
that
court
--
if
that
is
what
this
court
meant
in
the
taylor
case.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
but
the
rule
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
no,
your
honor
but
the
rule
has
no
significance
to
this
case.
the
rule
didn't
go
into
effect
until
after
this
case
was
already
decided.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
it's
the
rule
now
in
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
--
and
it
affects
all
--
that's
true.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
true
but
it
affects
this
case
and
the
other
--
all
the
cases
that
were
in
the
pipeline
prior
to
the
rule
going
into
effect.
the
rule
went
into
effect
july
1.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
it
will.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
oh
certainly,
because
it's
like
you
need
change
in
criminal
rules
in
kentucky
or
in
any
of
the
other
states
who
are
in
federal
government.
a
change
in
criminal
rule
does
not
retroactively
affect
all
other
cases
that
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
true.
i
certainly
agree
with
you.
that
really
is
not
before
us.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i'm
not
asking
you
to
rule
on
that
rule
on
the
changing
rule
because
this
hasn't
--
the
rule
hadn't
went
into
effect.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
brought
it
up
to
advice
the
court
of
what
was
happening
in
kentucky.
and
also
i
believe
this.
the
rule
in
kentucky
before
the
taylor
case
came
down
was
that
there
was
absolutely
no
necessity
for
a
presumption
of
innocence
instruction
at
all
if
a
reasonable
doubt
instruction
was
given.
now
i
think
in
some
cases
there
would
be
no
violation
of
constitutional
rules
if
you
don't
have
the
extraneous
negative
circumstances
like
occurred
in
taylor
which
in
effect
infected
that
man's
right
to
a
fair
and
reasonable
trial
to
be
tried
only
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
presented
at
trial.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
you
mean
the
last
paragraph
in
the
argument?
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor
but
that
instance
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes
but
that's
just
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i'm
sorry
i
had
the
wrong
page
your
honor.
what
that
means
we
feel
is
this.
as
i've
said
earlier,
our
case
was
--
we
had
a
twofold
approach.
the
first
being
is
an
ad
hoc
basis
and
not
a
per
se
rule.
the
second
aspect
of
our
case
is
if
taylor
created
a
per
se
rule,
if
what
you
said
in
taylor
means
that
you
have
to
give
the
instruction
if
you
don't
its
constitutional
error.
then
what
we
submitted
in
our
brief,
which
by
the
way
was
written
prior
to
the
decision
of
our
court
in
the
watson
case,
was
that
if
a
per
se
rule
is
created
then
the
harmless
error,
the
court
can
turn
to
the
harmless
error
rule
under
the
chapman-harrington
case
is
determined
on
a
case
to
case
basis.
starting
with
the
point
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
as
to
the
application
of
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
that's
true.
however
justice
brennan
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
oh
yes,
i
believe
it
has.
in
the
whorton
case
it
said
quite
clearly
we
think
that
we
interpret
taylor
to
mean
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
right
that
if
this
is
a
per
se
rule,
if
this
is
a
per
se
rule
the
only
hope
we
have
is
to
apply
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
and
quite
candidly
the
watson
case
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
they
had
chosen
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
they
have
chosen
in
that
case,
i
agree
justice
brennan
that
they
have
chosen
not
to
apply
the
federal
harmless
error
rule.
but
before
you
ever
get
to
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
in
the
chapman
versus
harrington,
you
have
to
have
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
now
if
it's
across
the
board.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
going
back
to
that.
then
in
other
words,
you
look
at
the
case
--
you
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
in
order
to
determine
whether
its
negative
circumstances
pyramiding
until
you
have
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor
it's
like
the
rule,
like
it's
the
amendment
of
the
criminal
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
exactly,
exactly
justice
white.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
oh,
no.
it
might
appear
as
somewhat
an
awkward
situation
where
you
have
to
--
first
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
to
determine
whether
there
is
constitutional
error
if
this
is
an
ad
hoc
application
of
the
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
in
assumes
you
could
say
that.
i
see
what
you're
saying
is
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
well
because
what
do
you
have
to
do
was
saying
on
ad
hoc
basis
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
we
think
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
the
presumption
of
innocence
instruction
where
there
are
no
extraneous
matters.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that
in
effect
i
guess
just
saying
exactly
what
you
just
said
justice
white.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
a
per
se
rule?
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well
what
that
is
of
course
is
assuming
as
a
per
se
rule
and
then
applying
a
harmless
error.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
right,
i
understand
that.
in
the
way
i
will
try
to
establish
it
in
my
own
manner,
because
i
was
getting
quite
confused
and
other
attorneys
in
our
office
were
saying
“well
what's
the
difference
of
approaching
the
facts
from
the
beginning
and
then
approaching
the
facts
in
the
end
on
the
two
arguments?”
and
the
difference
i
think
is
this.
is
that
if
it
is
an
ad
hoc
rule
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
to
determine
where
this
constitutional
violation.
and
i
believe
if
you
have
to
go
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
--
and
i
believe
--
if
you
have
to
do
that
for
the
ad
hoc
rule
to
establish
the
constitutional
violation,
i
don't
think
the
harmless
error
applies
in
an
ad
hoc
rule
case.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
correct
if
it's
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
because
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
first
to
determine
the
constitutional
violation.
i
don't
think
you
could
reasonably
go
and
look
back
as
the
facts
again
to
determine
there's
not
reversible
error
or
harmless
error.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
harmless
error
rules
have
only
been
applied
where
there
--
to
my
knowledge
where
there
is
a
per
se
constitutional
rule.
and
a
per
se
constitutional
rule
is
ordinarily
only
triggered
by
a
triggering
fact
or
a
triggering
factor
to
like
in
miranda.
if
a
man's
arrested
he
can't
be
questioned
unless
you'd
give
him
this
--
regardless
of
all
the
other
facts
and
circumstances,
that's
the
per
se
rule.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
and
if
you
want
to
get
the
others
in
the
trial,
of
course,
of
course
justice
stewart.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
correct
if
you
want
to
get
that
rule.
but
after
you
have
the
per
se
rule
then
you
can
look
to
see
if
it's
harmless,
because
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
facts
went
before
in
a
per
se
rule
because
there's
only
a
triggering
fact.
but
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
facts
to
determine
where
there's
actually
been
a
constitutional
violation.
in
any
event
if
this
court
did
create
a
per
se
rule,
we
believe
that
with
respect
to
the
second
aspect
of
our
case,
the
watson
decision,
may
very
well
have
cut
out
from
under
us
our
argument
as
to
the
application
of
the
federal
harmless
error
rule,
because
there's
nothing
in
chapman
and
we
candidly
concede
this.
there's
nothing
in
chapman
or
in
harrington
which
would
preclude
a
state
court
from
refusing
to
apply
the
harmless
error
rule
of
those
two
cases.
in
effect
that
does
nothing
more
than
create
a
stricter
and
more
narrow
standard
than
that
required
by
this
court,
if
there's
a
per
se
rule
established
to
begin
with.
if
there
is
not
then
you
don't
need
it
to
the
issue
of
the
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
a
constitutional
error?
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
i
think
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
but
you
know,
i
think
this
court
--
sometimes
opinions
are
written
in
such
an
atmosphere
sometimes
and
i
think
that
the
taylor
opinion
affected
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
a
certain
way.
and
i
think
you
can
see
what
way
it
affected
by
reading
the
whorton
opinion,
and
also
i
think
you
can
almost
see
a
type
of
reaction
by
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
for
the
first
time
changing
that
particular
kentucky
criminal
rule
to
mean
the
exact
opposite
of
what
it
ever
meant
in
the
past.
and
not
only
that,
this
court
in
taylor
criticized
the
skeletal
instruction
on
reasonable
doubt
interestingly
enough
on
the
amended
criminal
rule
in
kentucky.now
the
term
reasonable
doubt
can
not
even
be
defined.
i
think
that
this
was
used
to
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
oh
no,
i
don't
want
you
--
i
think
taylor
is
a
superb
case
for
its
facts
in
any
other
cases
that
come
within
the
degree
or
purview
of
those
type
of
facts
that
establish
a
constitutional
violation.
but
i
can
not
believe,
and
i
guess
i'll
find
out
soon
enough
whether
this
court
in
taylor
said,
that
you
have
to
give
that
instruction
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
when
requested.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
from
the
bench,
that
will
conclude
the
argument
for
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
thank
you.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
could
i
just
have
one
comment?
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
believe
the
reason
the
rule
was
amended
and
the
reason
the
whorton
opinion
was
written
the
way
it
was,
was
because
of
the
way
that
kentucky
supreme
court
had
it
fixed
in
their
minds
as
to
what
the
taylor
case
meant.
if
they
didn't
think
the
taylor
case
meant
a
per
se
rule,
kentucky
rule
procedure
in
kentucky
would
not
have
been
changed,
and
this
case
here
before
the
court
now
wouldn't
have
come
out
the
way
it
did.
that's
the
only
comment
i
have.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
think
looking
at
it
practically,
what
happened
was
a
knee-jerk
reaction
on
the
part
of
the
court
back
in
kentucky,
your
honor.
that's
why
the
rule
changed
and
that's
why
the
opinion
was
written
the
way
it
was.
and
that's
the
way
i
think
perhaps
the
court
should
have
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well
i
don't
come
to
that
conclusion
from
reading
the
language
in
the
whorton
opinion.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
were
a
little
bit
bothered
by,
i
don't
know
if
intervention
is
the
correct
word,
but
they
were
bothered
by
the
taylor
opinion
very
much
so.
and
they
took
it
to
mean
something
that
it
didn't
mean,
because
perhaps
i
think
they
reacted
too
quickly
to
it.
this
case
here
was
argued
seven
days
after
the
whorton
--
the
taylor
opinion
came
down.
the
rule
was
amended
the
very
next
day
and
went
into
effect
about
20
days
later
on
july
1.
i
think
of
course
in
all
criminal
cases
obviously
the
criminal
was
in
--
pardon
me
that
was
the
wrong
expression.
the
accused
is
entitled
to
justice.
the
commonwealth
is
entitled
to
justice
and
its
citizens
are
entitled
to
justice.
and
to
reverse
50
cases
or
more,
we
don't
know
what
the
final
number
will
be
yet,
is
a
possibility
here
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well
all
these
cases
come
before
the
court,
your
honor,
now
where
their
conviction
is
reversed.
if
this
court
reverses
the
whorton
case,
unless
there's
some
other
error
on
remand
other
than
this
per
se
business
here,
the
conviction
stands
of
--
the
conviction
will
then
become
affirmed.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
don't
know
that
they
would
revoke
this
rule
which
is
a
prospective
effect.
but
as
to
these
50
or
more
cases
in
the
pipeline
right
now,
many,
many
of
them
i
feel
the
convictions
will
be
affirmed.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
which
is
a
lower
court
below
the
kentucky
supreme
court
affirmed
two
criminal
convictions
after
taylor
came
down,
but
before
the
decision
in
whorton
came
down,
they
distinguished
the
taylor
case.
they
didn't
think
it
was
a
per
se
rule
at
all,
and
they
distinguished
it
and
affirmed
the
convictions.
and
i
think
this
is
what
will
happen
in
many
of
the
court
of
appeals
cases
and
kentucky
supreme
court
cases
that
have
now
been
automatically
reversed
due
to
what
we
feel
is
a
basic
misinterpretation.
whether
kentucky
supreme
court
wants
to
change
the
criminal
rule
that
they
amended
and
that
is
so
hastily,
i
don't
know.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
i
can
only
give
my
ideas
of
what
they
said,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
certainly,
justice
white.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
we'll
get
it,
yes.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
the
oldest
one?
the
oldest
one
of
course
in
progression
in
appeal
would
be
this
one.
the
most
recent
one
is
a
conviction
for
a
murder
case
for
the
accused
got
the
death
penalty.
and
it's
now
pending
before
the
kentucky
supreme
court
and
will
be,
if
things
go
as
they
are,
will
be
automatically
reversed.
there
are
29
issues
in
that
particular
case.
the
first
one
is
a
presumption
of
innocence,
instruction
was
requested
and
denied.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i'm
talking
about
cases,
yes,
they
are
going
to
retry
to
delay
the
cases
in
the
sense
that
we
ask
all
the
procedural
things
like
petitions
for
rehearing
and
this
and
that,
because
what
has
happened
is
we've
been
getting
blocked
up
with
all
these
cases
trying
to
keep
them
alive
until
they
get
to
this
court
and
hoping
for
a
decision
from
this
court.
if
we
lose,
so
be
it
on
the
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
we
don't
know,
because
we
don't
know
the
detail
of
when
these
have
come
up
or
not
because
it
would
depend
upon
whether
the
instruction
was
requested
or
not.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
right,
and
from
time
to
time
the
most
recent
case
was
about
two
weeks
ago
that
came
to
our
attention.
there
may
be
others
as
they
come
in
from
the
state
on
the
process
of
going
up
in
the
appellate
system.
when
we
originally
pursued
this
litigation
we
guess
--
we
made
a
guesstimate,
20
to
80
to
get
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
it
certainly
could
be,
it
certainly
could
be,
although
we
don't
know
the
--
any
exact
number
of
course.
thank
you
very
much.
