ms.
nanette
laughrey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there
are
three
issues
that
we
have
to
address
here.
first
of
all,
this
missouri's
jury
selection
system
systematically
excludes
women
which
i
believe
is
what
was
held
in
taylor
versus
louisiana
to
be
unconstitutional
if
it
resulted
in
jury
panels
which
are
almost
totally
male.
i
think
we
also
have
to
find
out
what
degree
of
disparity
must
be
proven
in
order
to
make
out
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
i
think
there's
also
a
question
as
to
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
in
these
cases.
i
will
first
address
the
question
as
to
whether
missouri's
jury
selection
system
systematically
excludes
women.
i
think
there
is
a
distinct
factual
difference
between
our
system
and
the
louisiana
system
and
that
in
louisiana,
women
were
not
included
in
the
jury
wheel
unless
they
took
affirmative
action.
there
was
an
assumption
that
they
were
not
interested.
in
missouri
on
the
other
hand,
women
are
treated
at
the
inception
of
the
process
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
are
men.
the
voter
registration
lists
are
used
and
names
are
selected
at
random
from
those
list
and
questionnaires
are
sent
out.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
i
think
an
exemption
does
not
exclude
women
or
doctors.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
it
gives
them
the
opportunity
not
to
participate
if
they
choose.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
yes,
your
honor
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
any
exemption
which
the
state
of
missouri
courts.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
i
think
it
is
wrong
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
don't
think
the
question
is
whether
the
fact
that
we
give
women
special
privilege
is
wrong.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
as
a
result
of
that;
billy
duren's
sixth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
your
honor
we
would
submit
that
no
it
is
not
and
the
--
ms.
nanette
laughrey
if
petitioner
has
not
shown
it
to
be.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
petition
--
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
show
why
there
was
so
few
women
on
the
jury
but
rather
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
petitioner.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
no
your
honor
because
we
--
ms.
nanette
laughrey
what
do
you
mean
by
justification?
ms.
nanette
laughrey
the
reduction
in
the
number
of
women
available
or
the
reason
for
the
exemption?
ms.
nanette
laughrey
one,
no.
the
exemption
originally
was
given
because
of
the
presumed
role
of
women
in
the
home
and
that
there
were
so
many
women
in
that
situation
that
they
should
be
given
an
exemption.
also,
there
was
some
intimation
that
women
should
be
given
a
choice
as
to
whether
they
wanted
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
juries
where
certain
details
might
be
describe
that
they
were
uncomfortable
in
hearing.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
those
--
ms.
nanette
laughrey
yes
your
honor,
that
is
true
and
i
think
this
court
in
the
past
has
characterized
those
as
--
ms.
nanette
laughrey
yes
your
honor
and
i
think
--
ms.
nanette
laughrey
i
think
the
question
your
honor
is
not
whether
we
can
justify
the
exemption
because
we
only
need
to
justify
the
exemption
once
it
has
been
shown
to
be
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
once
it
has
been
shown
to
operate
in
such
a
way
that
there
are
so
few
women
on
the
jury
panel
that
it
is
no
longer
fairly
representative
of
the
community.
and
it
is
our
belief
that
the
figures
in
this
case
are
sufficient
to
show
that
there
was
a
fair
cross-section
of
women
on
the
community,
on
the
panel.
we
would
point
to
the
fact
that
there
were
29%
women
on
the
master
jury
wheel
even
after
women
were
given
the
opportunity
to
fill
out
the
questionnaire
and
take
their
exemption
there
were
still
29%
women
which
is
three
times
more
than
the
situation
in
taylor
versus
louisiana.
there
were
15
times
more
women
on
the
venires
than
there
were
in
taylor
versus
louisiana.
in
taylor,
you
stated
that
it
would
be
a
violation
if
we
could
--
if
it
were
shown
that
the
exemption
or
the
exclusion
resulted
in
almost
totally
male
panels.
we
submit
to
you
that
almost
totally
male
is
not
an
accurate
characterization
of
the
panels
which
tried
billy
duren
and
which
are
used
in
jackson
county,
missouri.
as
i
said
before,
i
agree
that
what
once
were
justifications
for
our
exemption
maybe
outmoded
in
archaic.
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basis
of
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
billy
duren
somehow
was
deprived
of
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
because
the
indefinable
something
that
distinguishes
men
and
women.
i
submit
that
is
equally
outmoded
in
archaic
and
not
a
basis
for
finding
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
yes
your
honor,
taylor
did
say
so.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
i
submit
that
that
is
in
fact.
i
think
an
important
question
here
also
is
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
going
to
be
allocated
in
these
cases.
in
other
cases
which
are
pending
before
this
court
on
petitions
for
cert,
you
are
aware
that
there
has
been
evidence
introduced
to
show
that
the
reduction
from
54%
to
29%
on
the
jury
wheel
was
the
basis
of
the
questionnaires
and
the
exemptions
for
women.
this
however
is
not
in
the
record
before
this
court
and
we
submit
that
it
should
not
be
considered
by
this
court
since
it
was
not
considered
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
making
of
their
decision.
even
however,
if
you
do
consider
that
evidence,
there
is
still
no
explanation
for
the
diminution
of
the
amount
of
women
from
29%
to
15%
because
we
submit
that
if
a
woman
has
a
right
to
check
the
questionnaire
and
say,
"i
don't
want
to
serve"
and
she
doesn't
then
we
can
assume
that
she's
later
when
she's
called
to
serve
going
to
say,
“well,
the
only
reason
i'm
not
interested
in
serving
it's
because
i
am
a
woman.”
and
there
is
no
proof
in
the
record
here
as
to
why
women
were
excused
for
cause
by
the
judge
as
evidenced
in
the
tables
which
are
in
the
appendix.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
that
may
be
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
is
there
a
question?
ms.
nanette
laughrey
no,
that
was
correct
your
honor.
i
think
though
that
when
we're
talking
about
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
saying
that
he
did
not
have
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
that
--
and
not
allowing
the
state
of
missouri
to
justify
their
exemption
on
the
basis
of
outmoded
in
archaic
ideas.
it
seems
inconsistent
to
rely
on
those
kinds
of
ideas
to
fashion
the
sixth
amendment
violation.
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
burden
of
proof
for
a
minute
as
it
relates
to
the
reduction
of
women
from
29%
to
15%
and
from
54%
to
29%.
the
solicitor
general
would
like
this
court
to
say
that
there
some
kind
of
a
prima
facie
case
made
out
when
you
show
a
non-neutral
selection
process.
and
you
show
underrepresentation
and
they
try
to
relate
this
to
the
situation
in
which
this
court
has
found
discrimination
and
exclusion
of
a
particular
group
from
a
jury
on
the
basis
of
a
lower
representation
of
that
group
and
a
non-neutral
selection
process
a
subjective
selection
process.
and
if
shifted,
the
burden
to
the
state,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
reason
to
make
such
an
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
in
these
cases
because
of
the
fact
that
the
same
situation
is
simply
inapplicable
here
that
is
applicable
in
a
discrimination
case.
when
you're
talking
about
trying
to
point
at
some
place
in
a
subjective
process
where
discrimination
has
occurred,
it
is
impossible
for
the
defendant
to
go
into
that
process
and
find
out
at
what
point
that
happens
and
therefore
there
is
a
reason
for
developing
these
rules
about
the
prima
facie
case
in
shifting
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence
of
the
state.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
similar
reason
here
that
there
is
nothing
in
our
process
which
makes
it
easier
for
the
state
to
show
why
it
is
not
the
exemption
for
women
than
it
is
for
the
defendant
to
show
that
it
is
the
exemption
for
women
that
results
in
the
underrepresentation.
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
they
have
counted
the
questionnaires,
they
have
found
out
the
reason
as
far
as
other
cases
go.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
are
you
talking
about
justification
for
the
exemption?
ms.
nanette
laughrey
we
recognize
that
women
still
play
a
primary
role
in
the
home
that
even
though
women
may
in
fact
be
working
mothers
does
not
mean
that
they
have
been
relieved
of
the
responsibilities
of
their
obligations
to
the
home
or
to
their
family.
and
that
just
because
their
work
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
saying
that
they
no
longer
carry
the
responsibilities
that
they
were
once
thought
to
have.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
the
justification
for
this
exemption?
i
don't
know
what
the
legislative
justification
was.
we
do
not
have
any
evidence.
i
submit
that
that
is
the
strongest
justification
that
the
state
of
missouri
can
make
for
the
exemption.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
yes,
but
again,
it's
not
an
equal
protection
case.
i
don't
think
the
question
is
whether
our
exemption
is
good
or
bad.
it's
a
question
of
whether
it
fits
in
to
the
mold
of
taylor
versus
louisiana.
and
in
taylor
versus
louisiana,
there
were
certain
statements
about
what
made
out
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
there
had
to
be
systematic
exclusion
of
women.
we
submit
that
there
was
not
exclusion
of
women
here
because
we
did
not
assume
that
they
were
not
going
to
serve
on
juries
merely
because
they
did
not
opt
in
to
the
jury
selection
process.
i
would
like
to
point
to
one
place
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
that
i
think
it's
an
inaccurate
characterization
of
the
fact.
on
page
3,
they
indicate
that
if
women
do
not
return
their
questionnaires
and
do
not
respond
to
the
jury
service
summons
it
is
assumed
that
they
will
--
that
they
do
not
want
to
serve
and
that
is
not
true.
if
a
woman
does
not
return
her
questionnaire,
she
is
automatically
put
in
the
pool
from
which
juries
are
selected.
second
part
of
that
statement
is
true.
if
a
woman
does
not
respond
to
the
summons,
they
do
assume
that
she's
going
to
exercise
her
right
to
an
exemption.
but
i
think
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
a
process
which
at
the
beginning
does
not
include
women
in
the
jury
selection
system.
and
a
process
at
the
end
which
does
not
send
the
police
out
to
arrest
women
because
they
may
use
their
exemption
is
a
distinct
factual
deference.
i
think
also
if
you
look
at
the
statistics
in
the
appendix
and
the
tables
which
the
petitioner
has
provided,
you
will
see
that
the
number
of
women
who
do
not
respond
to
summons
is
insignificant
in
comparison
to
the
number
who
have
appeared
for
jury
duty
who
are
excused
and
for
other
reasons
and
end
up
appearing
on
the
jury
wheel
(voice
overlap).
ms.
nanette
laughrey
the
testimony
is
that
the
police
will
make
an
attempt
to
find
out
why
he
has
not
responding.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
there
is
a
distinction
at
that
point.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
he
is
subject
to
be
in
held
in
contempt
of
court.
now,
in
the
record
in
this
case
there
is
no
great
discussion
about
how
many
men
in
fact
are
found
to
be
held
in
contempt
of
court
whether
they
do
anything
about
it.
i
would
point
you
however
to
a
footnote
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
at
page
2,
footnote
1,
when
they
talk
about
the
saint
louis
jury
system
and
state
that
if
we
were
to
amplify
we
would
indicate
that
in
saint
louis
they
do
not
assume
from
the
fact
that
women
do
not
answer
the
summons
that
they
do
not
want
to
serve.
in
talking
with
mr.
ruland
(ph)
who
is
the
author
of
the
authority
which
they
cite,
the
situation
in
saint
louis
is
that
for
a
period
of
time,
they
experimented
and
they
went
out
and
try
to
find
out
why
people
did
not
show
up.
and
if
a
woman
did
not
show
up,
they
did
nothing
to
her
in
exactly
the
same
as
in
jackson
county.
what
they
really
--
ms.
nanette
laughrey
jackson
county
is
kansas
city,
missouri.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
your
honor
i
do
not
have
the
answer
to
that
question.
there
are
more
than
a
hundred.
jackson
county,
missouri
of
course
is
one
of
the
largest
population
areas.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
i
think
that
is
the
--
certainly
the
import
of
taylor
is
that
it
is
only
when
it
results
and
in
underrepresentation
in
a
particular
case
and
if
it
doesn't
result
in
under
representation
in
saint
louis
or
boom
county,
does
that
mean
that,
you
know
the
exemption
is
still
valid.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
well,
that's
true
your
honor
but
we
would
submit
that
even
if
the
missouri
supreme
court
were
reversed
in
this
case
that
this
is
not
a
situation
that
should
be
made
retroactive
that
we
think
that
the
rules
which
were
applicable
in
taylor
versus
louisiana
are
equally
applicable
in
this
case
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
because
of
the
factual
distinctions
between
taylor
versus
louisiana
and
the
situation
of
missouri.
we
do
not
think
that
taylor
is
so
dispositive
of
the
question
that
we
can
just
say,
“this
is
an
application
of
taylor.”
we
submit
that
it
is
an
extension
of
the
rational
in
taylor
largely
because
it's
based
on
statistics.
we
never
know
what
is
going
to
be
a
fair-cross-section
of
the
community
your
honors.
we
know
that
1%
is
too
small
and
we
know
that
54%
would
be
in
exact
mirror.
we
never
know
where
in
between
that
the
sixth
amendment
violation
occurs
and
therefore,
to
say
that
it's
merely
an
application
of
taylor
i
do
not
think
it's
correct.
and
before
you
have
stated
in
daniels
and
in
stovall
versus
daniels
the
standards
that
you
want
to
consider
when
you're
deciding
whether
something
is
retroactive
or
not
to
the
standards
in
addition
to
our
reliance
on
prior
law
would
be
the
interest
that
the
constitutional
provision
was
intending
to
protect
and
as
you
stated
in
daniel,
you're
not
submitting
that
billy
duren
was
prejudiced
in
any
way
that
you
know,
it
may
not
have
made
one
iota
a
difference
of
billy
duren
whether
there
were
women
in
his
pool
or
in
his
jury
or
whatever.
so,
there's
not
the
kind
of
inherent
prejudice
and
problems
that
would
be
where
a
defendant
is
denied
the
right
to
an
attorney
during
the
process
of
a
trial.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
no
your
honor.
we
of
course
submit
that
we
do
not
think
--
ms.
nanette
laughrey
--
that
there
is
any
prejudice
in
this
case.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
no,
i'm
saying
that
if
you
decide
that
it
was
error
and
it
was
unconstitutional
and
you're
considering
whether
it
is
retroactive
or
not
you
look
at
the
question
of
what
did
the
constitutional
provision
protect.
and
in
daniels,
you
indicated
that
what
the
sixth
amendment
fair-cross-section
protects
is
not
of
the
kind
that
would
necessitate
a
retroactive
application.
the
third
most
important
thing
is
what
happens
if
you
make
this
retroactive.
that
if
petitioner
has
tried
to
minimize
the
effect
that
it
would
have
on
the
administration
of
justice
in
jackson
county
by
saying
that
it
is
only
one
county
in
missouri.
i'm
sure
that
this
court
is
aware
of
that
half
of
the
population
in
the
state
of
missouri
is
in
the
metropolitan
kansas
city
area.
and
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
substantial
undermining
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
jackson
county,
missouri.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
your
honor
we
of
course
do
not
have
those
statistics
at
this
time.
you
are
aware
though
of
how
many
petitions
for
cert
have
already
been
filed
in
this
court
that
they
are
in
limbo
at
this
time
that
the
petitioner
can
certainly
tell
you
that
there
is
certainly
more
than
150
cases
in
which
this
issue
has
been
raised
and
in
which
the
statistics
have
been
made
out.
and
one
of
the
issues
that
you
indicated
that
you
would
consider
in
stovall
versus
denno
and
in
daniels
versus
louisiana
is
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
and
to
make
the
state
of
missouri
we
try
all
of
those
cases
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
in
our
state.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
no
it
is
not.
we
did
not
discuss
it
--
ms.
nanette
laughrey
i
do
not
have
the
citation
with
me.
ms.
nanette
laughrey
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
