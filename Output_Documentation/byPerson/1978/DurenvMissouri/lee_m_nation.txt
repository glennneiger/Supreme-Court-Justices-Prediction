mr.
lee
m.
nation
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
march
of
1976,
petitioner
billy
duren
appeared
for
trial
on
the
jackson
county
circuit
court.
appearing
with
mr.
duren
was
a
jury
panel.
that
panel
of
53
people
included
only
five
women.
billy
duren
moved
to
quash
the
jury
panel
on
the
basis
that
the
missouri
procedure
for
selecting
jurors
violates
his
right
to
a
reasonably
representative
cross-sectional
jury.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
okay,
thank
you.
i
think
i'm
okay.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
mr.
duren's
motion
to
quash
filed
before
trial
was
overruled
and
he
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
by
an
all
male
jury.
of
course,
our
challenge
here
is
bottomed
upon
taylor
versus
louisiana.
taylor
holds
first
that
petitioner
billy
duren
can
raise
such
a
challenge
concerning
women
on
juries.
and
second,
that
if
women
are
not
on
juries
in
sufficient
numbers,
billy
duren's
right
to
a
fair
cross-sectional
jury
panel
has
been
defeated.
the
missouri
court
--
mr.
lee
m.
nation
on
the
jury
panel.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
jury
panel.
the
missouri
court
and
the
state
here
attempt
to
distinguish
taylor
in
two
ways.
first,
that
the
effect
of
the
missouri
system
is
different
than
the
effect
of
the
taylor
system.
i
will
speak
to
that
issue.
my
co-counsel
professor
ginsburg
will
speak
to
the
distinction
the
state
makes
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
women's
exemption.
the
facts
of
this
case
speak
strongly.
jackson
county
is
54%
women.
voters
--
the
voter
registration
roles
are
used
to
pick
the
master
jury
wheel
and
we
would
assume
that
the
voter
registration
roles
through
the
statistics
in
our
brief
would
mirror
the
population
characteristic
of
54%.
each
year,
the
voter
registrations
roles
are
subjected
to
a
random
computer
search
which
draws
out
70,000
names.
these
names
are
then
sent
questionnaires
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
70,000
names
meet
missouri's
law
as
to
eligibility
for
service.
the
questionnaire
also
contains
the
women's
exemption.
the
first
question
on
the
questionnaire
is
“state
your
sex”
and
parenthetically,
“if
you
are
a
woman,
and
do
not
desire
to
serve,
see
the
bottom
of
the
page.”missouri
makes
it
very
easy
at
this
stage
for
women
to
opt
off
and
they
do
in
significant
numbers.
this
questionnaire
procedure
unquestionably
causes
the
diminution
from
54%
women
in
the
community
to
the
panel
which
is
30%
women,
excuse
me,
the
master
jury
wheel
which
is
30%
women.
our
inquiry
does
not
stop
there
however,
because
women
are
given
a
second
opportunity
to
opt
off
juries.
each
week
before
trials,
summonses
are
sent
out.
these
summonses
compel
only
the
attendants
of
men
to
serve
on
the
juries.
the
questionnaire
in
red
--
excuse
me,
the
summons
in
red
states,
“women,
if
you
do
not
desire
to
serve,
contact
the
jury
commissioner.”
the
jury
commissioner
john
fitzgerald
also
testified
that
if
women
just
ignored
the
summons,
she
would
be
deemed
to
have
exercised
her
exemption.
she
was
in
mr.
fitzgerald's
words,
“an
excused
female.”
men,
however,
their
names,
if
they
failed
to
appear
would
be
--
their
names
would
be
sent
to
the
bail
for
the
presiding
judge
who
would
attempt
to
contact
them.
these
summons
procedure
is
the
only
reason
for
the
diminution
between
the
master
jury
wheel
which
is
30%
and
the
number
of
women
appearing
for
trial
week
after
week.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
well,
the
missouri
supreme
court
cited
new
--
can
you
be
specific
as
to
which
claim
they
--
you're
referring
to?
mr.
lee
m.
nation
yes.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
there
are
several
things.
first,
they
didn't
like
the
fact
that
we
used
1970
population
statistics
which
of
course
are
the
only
statistics
that
are
available.
they
didn't
like
the
fact
that
in
the
opinion
that
the
master
jury
wheel
count
was
as
they
said
only
an
unverified
pencil
sketch.
apparently,
they
forgot
to
read
the
transcript
because
there
was
testimony
concerning
the
actual
count
of
the
jury
wheel
week
after
week
after
week
prior
to
billy
duren's
trial,
the
panel's
average
14.5%
women.
they
questioned
the
statistics
but
i
believe
the
statistics
in
this
case
are
in
such
a
posture
that
we
can
reach
the
merits
certainly.
further,
a
woman
is
again
given
an
opportunity
to
opt
off
jury
service
even
after
she
appears,
even
after
she
appears
at
any
point
before
she
has
sworn
as
a
juror,
she
can
decide
to
go
home.
petitioner
billy
duren's
jury
panel
in
this
case
of
53
people
with
five
women,
there
were
almost
ten
times
as
many
men
on
the
jury
panel
as
there
were
women.
now,
the
state
and
the
missouri
supreme
court
have
said
that
these
facts
are
not
conclusive.
in
some,
what
they
want
petitioner
to
do
is
to
prove
that
there
is
no
conceivable
or
even
inconceivable
reason
which
would
cause
this
underrepresentation.
as
was
noted
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
constitutional
provision
allowing
women
to
opt
off
juries
is
the
only
possible
explanation
for
the
under-representation.
further,
petitioner
--
mr.
lee
m.
nation
the
missouri
constitutional
provision.
further,
it
is
petitioner's
position
that
we
have
made
a
prima
facie
case
that
we
have
shown
first
that
the
jury
selection
procedure
in
jackson
county
is
non-neutral,
that
women
are
given
an
exemption
which
men
are
not.
and
second,
we
have
shown
that
in
week
after
week,
jury
panels
appear
for
jury
service
that
are
only
14.5%
women
in
a
community
that
is
54%
women.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
well,
the
statistics
that
are
in
our
brief
indicate
that
in
missouri,
men
registered
to
vote
--
71%
of
the
men
were
registered
to
vote
and
69.9%
of
the
women
registered
to
vote.
therefore
we
--
i
think,
can
assume
that
right
around
54%
will
be
what
the
voter
role
is.
further
the
--
mr.
lee
m.
nation
that's
correct.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
70
to
69%.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
excuse
me,
i
didn't
--
what
was
your
question?
mr.
lee
m.
nation
i
imagine
the
--
the
computer
selects
people
from
the
voter
registration
rolls
and
we
don't
know
exactly
what
percentage
of
those
people
selected
or
those
people
who
were
sent
questionnaires
are
men
and
women
because
obviously,
some
of
the
questionnaires
never
returned.
people
either
ignore
them
or
they're
lost
or
people
have
moved
away
or
died.
so
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
who
is
mailed
questionnaires.
but
presumably,
if
it
is
randomly
drawn
from
voter
registration
roles,
it
would
be
about
again
54%
female.
petitioner
billy
duren
asserts
here
that
we
have
made
a
prima
facie
case,
that
we
have
shown
a
non-neutral
jury
selection
method
and
that
we
have
shown
underrepresentation.
thus,
it
is
now
incumbent
upon
the
state,
upon
the
respondent
to
give
some
constitutionally
permissible
reason
for
the
fact
that
billy
duren's
jury
panel
was
9%
women.
there
is
one
point
that
i
agree
with
respondent
and
with
the
missouri
supreme
court.
jackson
county
is
not
as
bad
as
taylor.
taylor's
panel
of
1%
was
very,
very
low.
but
i
don't
believe
a
fair
reading
of
taylor
that
taylor
stands
for
the
proposition
that
anything
above
1%
is
constitutionally
permissible.
instead,
the
thrust
of
taylor
is
obviously
that
any
system
which
denies
an
accused
his
right
to
a
panel
with
reasonably
representative
participation
of
the
elements
of
society
also
violates
his
right
to
jury
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment.
the
importance
of
a
jury,
your
honor,
as
everyone
knows
is
--
it
is
the
body
that
is
interposed
between
the
accused
and
the
accuser.
it
is
our
way
of
guaranteeing
a
man
a
fair
trial
and
thus
it
must
be
woven
from
the
fabric
of
the
community
that
we
cannot
exclude
any
identifiable
group
that
they
must
be
represented
on
jury
panels
so
that
an
individual
can
have
a
possibility
of
having
these
people
on
his
final
jury.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
from
the
past
precedents
of
this
court.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
such
as
taylor.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
that
it
--
a
state
cannot
exclude
an
identifiable
group
by
--
on
juries.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
blacks,
mexican-americans.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
that's
--
i
think
that's
about
as
far
as
we've
gone.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
that
doesn't
--
the
prior
cases
in
the
federal
circuits
have
not
held
those
to
be
identifiable
groups.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
well,
they're
identifiable
groups
in
a
common
sense
language
but
as
in
terms
of
jury,
in
the
jury
cases,
they
have
not
been
recognized
as
important
enough
that
we
need
to
include
them
on
juries.
also
they
make
up
of
--
mr.
lee
m.
nation
well,
perhaps
he
might
be
able
to.
however,
lawyers
are
very
small
percentage
of
the
community
and
they're
--
even
the
possibility
of
they're
being
on
juries
is
de
minimis.
finally,
the
system
which
denies
a
defendant
his
right
to
a
reasonably
representative
cross
sectional
jury
panel
violates
the
sixth
amendment
and
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
yes.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
the
statement
made
in
our
reply
brief
was
that
women
who
do
not
return
the
questionnaires
and
who
do
not
follow
the
request
of
the
summons
do
not
appear
for
jury
service.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
it
was
something
like
that
in
the
brief
that
--
yes,
and
that's
the
reason
that
the
wheel
is
as
high
as
it
is.
that's
the
reason
that
there
is
29%
women
on
the
wheel
it's
because
if
they
don't
return
the
questionnaire,
they're
put
onto
the
wheel
and
then,
they
opt
off
when
they
receive
the
summons.
i'm
not
sure
what
we
could
further
prove
prior
to
trial.
to
prove
a
case
i
believe
under
the
precedence
of
this
court
of
prima
facie
case
has
been
made.
we
showed
a
non-neutral
selection
procedure
and
we
showed
marked
underrepresentation
of
women.
now,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
come
up
with
some
reasonable
explanation
and
attributing
the
fact
that
14.5%
of
jury
panels
could
possibly
be
random
chance
or
something
else.
the
possibility
of
that
happening
is
infinitesimal.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
well,
under
taylor,
you
have
to
prove
that
there
is
an
exemption
and
that
there
is
underrepresentation.
no
statute
is
would
--
is
per
se
unconstitutional
but
in
its
effect
here
in
jackson
county
it
is.
further,
the
only
reason
--
mr.
lee
m.
nation
yes.
the
exemption
is
the
same
for
other
counties
in
the
state
but
other
people
hide
the
exemption
from
their
women.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
only
in
a
case
where
there
is
absolutely
no
question
of
credibility
for
the
jury.
in
any
case
where
the
jury
has
to
determine
the
credibility
of
witnesses
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
it's
harmless
error
or
harmless
constitutional
error.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
well,
your
honor
as
a
criminal
defense
lawyer,
i
have
occasionally
had
instances
where
my
client
--
the
only
reason
where
a
trial
is
not
to
contest
the
facts
but
to
try
and
receive
a
light
sentence
because
in
missouri
the
jury
sentences
and
it's
my
experience
that
women
are
much
more
sympathetic
towards
defendants
than
men
are.
so,
in
that
instance,
even
in
that
situation
--
mr.
lee
m.
nation
i
don't
think
they're
fungible.
mr.
lee
m.
nation
there
is
--
i
don't
know
how
many,
there
are
seven
i
believe
petitions
for
certiorari
on
this
issue
before
the
court.
and
i
have
nowhere
near
150
cases.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
number
is.
but
we
believe
as
far
as
retroactivity
that
this
case
falls
squarely
under
taylor
and
that
anyone
who
raised
it
prior
to
trial
introduced
evidence
requested
the
court
to
quash
the
jury
panel
and
give
him
a
reasonably
representative
jury
at
trial
should
be
afforded
a
new
trial.
thank
you.
