justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nation,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
expressed
some
dissatisfaction
with
your
numerical
claims.
oh,
in
what
posture
do
you
think
we
find
that
factual
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
am
--
i
think
it's
the
court's
majority
and
i
don't
have
the
opinion
directly
before
me,
but
it's
a
phrase
that
casts
some
--
gives
some
indication
it
is
not
satisfied
in
it
that
you
have
satisfactorily
demonstrated
the
facts
in
which
you're
relying
but
goes
on
to
treat
it
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
as
if
you
had
nothing
left.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
federal
constitutional
provision
of
your
missouri
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
that
from
that
you
--
the
const
--
the
federal
constitution
prohibits
a
state
from
excluding
any
identifiable
group?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
such
as?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
what
taylor
said?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
carry
that
beyond
discrimination
between
the
sexes
or
what
other
identifiable
groups?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
beyond
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
a
lawyer
can
make
a
much
bigger
impact
if
he's
a
member
of
a
jury
than
a
woman
as
a
woman
or
a
mexican-american
as
a
mexican-american?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
won't
settle
for
putting
susan
b.
anthony
on
the
new
dollar,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
laughrey,
let
me
get
back
for
a
moment
if
i
may
to
your
comment
about
the
outmoded
stereotype
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question.
actually,
a
jury
--
lawyers
who
pick
juries
operate
largely
on
stereotypes,
don't
they?
in
the
sense
that,
you
know
people
of
certain
nationalities
are
believed
to
award
higher
personal
injury
verdicts
than
others.
and
others
--
there's
types
that
are
supposed
to
be
more
favorable
to
criminal
defendants,
others
are
kind
of
hard
hearted
and
favorable
to
the
prosecution,
there
maybe
very
little
to
them,
to
the
stereotypes,
perhaps,
they're
not
justified
but
certainly
a
lot
of
lawyers
use
them
in
picking
juries
in
using
their
preemptory
challenge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
question,
you
say
in
effect
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
to
billy
duren
that
there
weren't
that
many
women
on
the
jury
because
there
really
isn't
much
--
the
concept
that
women
would
react
differently
than
men
is
outmoded
or
did
i
misinterpretation
your
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
counties
are
there
in
missouri?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
a
case
based
on
statistics
from
jackson
county
although
it
would
affect
the
substantial
number
of
people
in
missouri
would
not
be
determinative
of
other
convictions
obtained
in
other
counties,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
a
federal
habeas
judge
sitting
in
the
western
district
of
missouri
maybe
scanning
convictions
of
--
if
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
has
reversed
50
different
counties
and
he's
going
to
have
to
get
evidence
as
to
the
functioning
of
the
jury
system
and
each
of
those
counties
before
he
can
decide.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
claim
the
missouri
statute
though
is
unconstitutional
in
all
situations.
it
has
to
be
accompanied
by
your
jackson
county
statistical
showing?
