justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
ginsburg,
somewhere
in
these
briefs,
the
opposing
brief
says
a
suggestion
that
if
mr.
duren
prevails
here,
the
missouri
jailhouse
doors
might
be
open,
do
you
have
any
comment?
what
is
your
response
to
that
suggestion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
what
the
follow
through
in
the
louisiana
case
was?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
was
that
ruling
specifically
held
not
retroactive?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
so
the
result
is
that
the
louisiana
jails
were
not
open
and
you
think
this
would
follow
here
also?
