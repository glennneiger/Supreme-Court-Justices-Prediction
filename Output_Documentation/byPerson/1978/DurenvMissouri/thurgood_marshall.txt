mr.
nation,
if
you
excuse
me,
there's
a
crank
on
the
side
that
you'd
--
lift
it
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
that
microphone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
microphone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
that
they
have
--
the
woman
has
two,
a
woman
doctor
has
two
exemptions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
see
any
thing
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
the
direct
result
of
them
having
only
0.9
women
on
the
jury,
the
direct
result
of
the
missouri
practice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
cause
it?
what
would
cause
this?
where
you
have
54%
population,
what
would
make
it
possible
to
have
such
as
small
amount,
lets
say
among
juries?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
if
you're
unreasonably
requested
to
do
so,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can't
justify
it,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
the
word
it
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
for
the
exemption,
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
at
a
time
when
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
weren't
even
qualified
to
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
they
make
contracts.
or
to
make
contracts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
just
couldn't
do
anything
but
tend
a
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
taylor
say
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we're
going
to
give
a
lot
of
trouble
cause
that
wasn't
my
experience.
