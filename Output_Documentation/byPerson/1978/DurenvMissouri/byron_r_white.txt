but
you
would
think
--
you
would
argue,
i
suppose
that
taylor
mandated
the
invalidation
of
the
missouri
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
this
ought
to
go
back
at
least
to
taylor.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose,
it
was
sought
that
prima
facie
case
had
been
made
out,
does
the
state
--
what's
the
state's
strongest
argument
in
justification
or
do
you
have
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
for
treating
women
different
than
men
and
in
terms
of
excuse.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
is
that
a
--
do
you
think
that's
the
legislative
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
a
--
what
percentage
of
the
convicts
who
were
convicted
in
jackson
county
--
what
percentage
of
those
are
still
in
--
who've
been
convicted
since
taylor
are
still
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
to
review
a
judgment
of
that
court
affirming
a
--
the
conviction
of
petitioner,
duren,
for
first-degree
murder.
under
the
missouri
law,
women
are
eligible
for
jury
duty
and
are
subject
to
call,
but
they
are
--
but
they
are
entitled
to
an
automatic
exemption
upon
their
request,
no
similar
excuse
is
available
to
men.
duren
claims
that
his
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
a
trial
by
a
jury
representing
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community
is
violated
by
the
scheme.
the
missouri
supreme
court
rejected
the
--
the
submission,
we
reversed.
as
we
explain
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
this
case
is
ruled
by
taylor
against
louisiana
and
decided
a
few
terms
ago
and
under
that
case
and
under
the
constitution
the
missouri
selection
scheme
is
invalid,
and
hence,
we
reversed
the
judgments
of
missouri
supreme
court.
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
