ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
yes,
i
could
do
that.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
argument
addresses
the
citizen's
duty
tied
to
a
defendant's
fair
cross
section
right
and
the
complete
absence
of
justification
for
exempting
any
woman.
though
jackson
county
jury
panels
are
dominated
by
men,
the
missouri
supreme
court
said
that
the
right
affected
is
unimpaired.
that
reasoning
in
two
key
respects
is
topsy-turvy.
first,
the
right
central
in
this
case,
the
right
secured
by
the
sixth
amendment
is
the
criminal
defendants.
here
billy
duren's
right
to
a
fair
chance
for
a
jury
genuinely
representative
of
the
community's
complexion
and
second,
the
vaunted
woman's
privilege
viewed
against
history's
backdrop
simply
reflects
and
perpetuates
a
certain
way
of
thinking
about
women.
women
traditionally
were
deemed
lesser
citizens.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
mr.
duren
has
a
right
to
a
jury
drawn
from
a
panel
reasonably
representative
of
the
community.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
and
as
this
--
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
yes.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
but
that
was
the
traditional
justification
given
by
states.
first,
for
excluding
women
altogether
and
then
second
--
the
second
step
was
providing
an
exemption
for
any
women
the
notion
being
that
the
women
are
not
really
needed,
not
really
wanted
for
participation
in
the
democratic
processes
of
government.
viewed
in
that
light,
this
is
hardly
a
privilege.
this
is
hardly
a
favor
to
the
supposedly
favored
class.
but
as
to
the
quo
right
at
stake,
judge
saylor
dissenting
below
pointed
out
a
defendant's
fair
cross
section
right
can
be
meaningful
only
if
it
hinges
on
a
correlative
duty,
the
duty
of
the
citizen
to
show
up
for
jury
service
when
summoned.
a
privilege
to
avoid
service
at
whim,
prominently
advertised
and
readily
available
to
any
woman
or
any
man
or
any
other
large,
stable,
distinctive
population
group,
the
basis,
the
defendant's
cross
section
right,
that
right
is
real
only
when
the
obligation
to
serve
is
placed
on
citizens
without
automatic
exemption
based
solely
on
their
race,
national
origin
or
sex.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
exemptions
that
apply
on
the
basis
of
one's
occupations
reflect
determinations
by
the
state
that
certain
occupations
for
the
good
of
the
community
should
be
pursued
uninterrupted
and
it
makes
no
difference
whether
a
person
is
male/female,
black
or
white,
it's
the
neutral,
functional
category
that
is
excluded,
doctor,
lawyer,
dentist,
clergy
not
any
woman
--
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
there
are
several
--
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
there
are
several
states
that
have
exemptions
for
persons
primarily
responsible
for
the
care
of
young
children.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
it
could
be
husband
or
wife,
yes.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
but
by
using
the
term
assuming
that
it
will
be
the
woman
here
or
in
a
more
general,
any
woman
excuse,
the
state
is
providing
an
ineludible
message
that
the
male
citizens
are
counted
by
government
as
the
essential
participants
of
the
administration
of
justice
but
the
female
citizens
are
not
so
counted,
this
service
is
expendable.
i
would
like
to
stress
--
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
that
was
an
issue
that
the
court
addressed
in
taylor
against
louisiana.
yes,
men
and
women
are
persons
of
equal
dignity
and
they
should
count
equally
before
the
law
but
they
are
not
the
same.
there
are
differences
between
them
that
most
of
us
value
highly.
this
court
said
twice,
first
in
ballard
against
united
states
and
then
in
taylor
against
louisiana
that
there
is
a
certain
quality
that
would
certainly
be
missing
from
that
jury
--
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
what
is
the
rele
--
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
is
that
indefinable
something
--
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
i
think
that
we
--
perhaps
all
understand
it
when
we
see
it
and
we
feel
it
but
it
is
not
that
easy
to
describe,
yes,
there
is
a
difference.
in
any
event,
missouri's
insistence
that
9
to
15%
representation
of
women
is
quite
enough
although
it
is
an
exorbitant
argument
is
understandable
for
the
state
to
this
day
has
urged
no
justification
whatever
for
exempting
any
woman.
missouri
makes
no
claim
that
this
women's
excuse
is
even
minimally
rational,
though
to
overcome
a
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
as
taylor
held
merely
rational
grounds
would
not
suffice.
the
court
said
in
taylor
that
is
untenable
to
suggest
it
would
be
a
special
hardship
for
a
woman
to
perform
jury
duty
simply
because
of
her
sex.
post
taylor
then,
a
woman's
work
whether
at
home
or
on
the
job
and
the
administrative
convenience
of
treating
all
women
as
expendable,
these
are
not
even
arguable
basis
for
diminishing
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
by
diluting
the
quality
of
community
judgment
a
jury
trial
provides.
moreover,
eliminating
the
exemption
for
any
woman
clouds
no
reasonable
jury
service
exemption.
only
two
states,
missouri
and
tennessee
today
maintain
a
solely
sex-based
exemption.
other
missouri
exemptions
are
tied
to
occupation,
prior
service,
individual
hardship,
not
to
an
unalterable
identification
each
of
us
is
marked
with
at
birth
and
identification
bearing
no
necessary
relationship
to
one's
capacity
or
life
situation
and
therefore
inherently
unreasonable
as
a
basis
for
jury
duty
avoidance.
in
some,
no
sense
at
all
nourishes
missouri's
solely
sex-based
exemption
implemented
by
jackson
county's
prominent
invitations
to
any
woman
to
sign
off
and
the
jury
commissioner's
assumption
from
a
woman's
inaction
that
she
doesn't
want
to
serve.
have
it?
yes.
surely
not
analysis
or
actual
reflection
accounts
for
an
excuse
based
simply
on
a
woman's
sex
and
not
on
what
she
does
or
is
capable
of
doing.
finally,
the
court's
eight
to
one
judgment
in
taylor
leaves
no
room
for
the
missouri
argument
that
billy
duren
must
show
how
he
in
particular
might
have
been
disadvantaged
by
a
violation
of
the
fair
cross-section
requirement.
selection
of
a
criminal
trial
jury
from
a
representative
cross-section,
the
court
held
in
taylor
is
an
essential
component
of
a
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right.
neither
missouri
nor
this
court
is
at
liberty
to
apply
or
dispense
with
the
cross-section
rule
based
on
the
view
of
prosecutor
or
of
judge
of
the
strength
of
the
evidence
against
a
defendant.
full
respect
for
the
cross-section
command
is
required
of
the
state
because
the
constitutional
safeguard
is
guaranteed
to
all
and
it
may
be
relied
upon
by
every
person,
the
most
low
and
the
least
deserving
to
the
same
extent
as
the
most
upright
and
virtuous.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
i
think
it's
certainly
the
case
that
this
objection
is
available
only
the
defendants
who
have
properly
raised
it
below
and
pursued
it
on
appeal.
moreover,
it
would
be
relevant
only
the
case
of
jackson
county.
that
questionnaire
and
that
summons
in
the
record
that
flags
and
signals
repeatedly
that
women
may
take
themselves
off.
those
are
used
only
in
jackson
county
and
no
other
county
in
missouri,
so
i
would
say
we
are
talking
about
one
county
only,
about
trials
post
this
court's
decision
in
taylor
against
louisiana
an
only
in
cases
where
the
objection
has
been
properly
raised
and
pursued
under
missouri
law.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
yes.
billy
joe
taylor
was
retried
and
reconvicted.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
but
you
held
that
it
was
not
retroactive.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
in
taylor
against
louisiana,
you
overturn
a
fairly,
a
1961
precedent,
hoyt
against
florida.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
i
certainly
think
so.
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
at
least
--
yes.
to
--
ms.
ruth
b.
ginsburg
although
that's
not
necessary
part
of
the
case
that's
here
today,
yes,
that
was
a
message
that
new
york
got
and
other
states,
all
states
except
missouri
and
tennessee
got
that
message.
to
conclude,
the
unconstitutionality
of
missouri's
excuse
for
any
woman
as
it
operates
to
distort
jackson
county
jury
panels
is
plainly
established.
any
sensible
reading
of
this
record
juxtaposed
with
this
court's
eight
to
one
judgment
in
taylor
leads
ineluctably
to
that
conclusion.
