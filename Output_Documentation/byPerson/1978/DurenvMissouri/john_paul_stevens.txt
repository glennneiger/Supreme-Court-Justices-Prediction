mrs.
ginsburg,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
if
we
look
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant
and
you
take
the
view
as
i
think
you
do
that
men
and
women
are
essentially
fungible
for
purposes
of
jury
service,
how
is
the
cross
section
heard
if
women
are
excluded?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
relevant
difference
between
men
and
women
for
the
purposes
of
jury
service,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
sounds
kind
of
like
a
stereotype
answer
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
taylor
is
based
on
an
outmoded
stereotype
is
what
you're
saying.
that's
your
argument?
i
think
it
is.
