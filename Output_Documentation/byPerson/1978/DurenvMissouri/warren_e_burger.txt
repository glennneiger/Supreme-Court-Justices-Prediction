we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
6067,
duren
against
missouri.
mr.
nation,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
up
the
other
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wait
a
minute,
did
you
say
the
on
the
jury
or
on
the
jury
panel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
the
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
because
of
some
lesser
registration
in
the
voting
process
by
women?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
when
their
--
when
the
wheel
is
made
up,
it
doesn't
reflect
the
voter
population
on
your
figures,
you've
got
definitely
70
to
60.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
explanation
for
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
roughly
70.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
explanation
for
why
the
drawings
don't
average
out
fairly
close
to
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
ginsburg,
you
may
lower
the
lectern
if
you
would
like.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
wouldn't
concern
mr.
duren,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
as
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
who
wouldn't
--
he
wouldn't
be
interested
in
the
factor
you
mentioned
whether
this
is
fair
or
unfair
to
the
women,
they're
called
for
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
a
jury
service
or
not
called,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
very
few
doctors
serve
on
juries
in
missouri
state
courts
as
is
true
in
most
states
which
--
would
you
regard
that
a
--
as
a
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
preclude
the
state
from
saying
that
without
getting
into
that
old
clich√©
about
women's
places
in
the
home,
if
the
state
said
in
effect,
mothers
of
small
children
should
belong
at
home
not
serving
on
juries.
now,
suppose
it
were
narrowed
to
housewives
with
children
under
16
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
would
you
still
have
the
same
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that'd
be
husbands
or
wives
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
have
no
jurisdiction
to
make
that
concession,
mrs.
ginsburg.
thank
you.
ms.
laughrey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
there
are
generally
in
the
category
of
physicians
and
others
who's
as
--
who
was
conceded
by
i
think
your
friends
in
the
other
side
of
the
table
was
permissible
exclusion
on
the
part
of
the
state
for
reasons
of
public
policy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
do
you
call
it,
exemption
or
exclusion?
since
it
gives
the
woman
the
opportunity
to
get
off
the
jury
more
readily
than
it
goes
to
other
people,
carpenters
and
bookkeepers,
then
why
is
it
different?
do
you
suggest
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
that
dispensation
given
the
physicians,
is
that
your
--
part
of
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
under
mcgowan
against
maryland
if
there
was
any
rational
reason
for
it,
we'd
give
that
considerable
weight
i
suppose,
would
we,
should
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
hinting
at
a
harmless
error
even
assuming
all
that
your
friends
say
that
it's
harmless
error?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
an
alternate,
i
wonder
whether
you're
making
an
alternative
argument
that
this
is
harmless
error
even
if
otherwise
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
nation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
didn't
have
--
there
seems
to
be
disagreement
on
the
factual
situation
between
you
and
the
state
about
the
women
who
do
not
return
their
questionnaires.
she
says
they
are
automatically
put
--
and
you
said
they
were
automatically
out
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
isn't
quite
the
way
you
put
it
in
your
argument.
i
think
there
was
a
little
difference
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
--
in
a
specific
case,
could
this
ever
--
in
your
view
be
harmless
error?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
a
defendant
on
the
stand
under
cross-examination
has
as
it
has
happened
in
some
cases,
testified
in
a
way
that
its
added
up
to
essentially
a
judicial
confession
of
the
crime,
would
you
think
that'd
be
the
kind
that
could
be
harmless
error?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

fungible,
it's
a
--
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-6067,
duren
against
missouri
will
be
announced
by
