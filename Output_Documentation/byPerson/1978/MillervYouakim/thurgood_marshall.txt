but
this
also
in
a7
includes
child
care
institutions
too
which
is
not
involved
in
this
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
also
includes
603(a)(1).
what
is
this
just
a
hard
project?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
problem
i
don't
understand
it,
you
understood
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
is
it
that
in
this
case,
this
is
not
included
in
all
of
this
language
on
page
86
and
87,
which
i
don't
understand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
respondents
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
will
not
pay
this
people
that
are
in
this
case
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
my
question
is
why!
w-h,
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
--
what
about
607?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
77-742,
this
is
from
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
case
presents
the
question
whether
illinois
may
prohibit
foster
children
to
live
with
relatives
from
participating
in
its
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children-foster
care
program
of
illinois.
under
the
illinois
statute,
foster
children
placed
by
the
state
with
unrelated
caretakers
are
eligible
for
the
foster
care
program.
children
placed
with
relatives
however
qualifies
only
for
the
basic
afdc
program
which
provides
a
little
monthly
payments
than
the
foster
care
program.
this
distinction
between
related
and
unrelated
foster
parents
is
based
on
illinois
definition
of
the
term
“foster
family
home"
as
being
a
facility
for
children
who
are
unrelated
to
the
operator
of
the
home.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
state's
practice
conflicted
with
the
social
security
act
and
we
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
held
that
illinois
may
not
consistent
with
the
social
security
act
exclude
from
its
foster
care
program
children
placed
with
relatives.
section
408
(a)
of
the
social
security
act
establishes
certain
eligibility
conditions
of
the
foster
care
program
among
which
is
required
that
the
child
be
placed
by
the
state
in
a
foster
family
home.
the
act
defines
this
term
“foster
family
home"
broadly
making
no
distinction
between
related
and
non-related
foster
homes
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
related
foster
parents
from
the
definition
of
this
term,
we
believe
that
it
would
have
done
so
explicitly.
the
legislative
history
of
the
foster
care
program
further
reveals
congress'
intent
to
include
in
the
program
all
eligible
foster
children
without
regard
to
the
ultimate
placement.
the
program
was
designed
to
correct
enduring
effects
of
the
past
neglect
and
abuse.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
differentiate
it
amongst
children
equally
neglected
and
abused.
absent
clear
support
in
the
statutory
language
or
legislative
history,
we
decline
to
attribute
such
an
unreasonable
intent
to
congress.
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
also
interpret
the
statute
to
include
foster
children
placed
with
relatives.
this
interpretation
by
the
agency
charged
with
administering
the
program
is
entitled
to
considerable
deference.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
