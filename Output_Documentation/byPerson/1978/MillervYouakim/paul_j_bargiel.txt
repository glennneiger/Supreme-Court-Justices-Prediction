mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
began
in
january
of
1974
when
the
plaintiff's
father
complained
against
the
department
of
children
and
family
services
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
complaint
challenged
the
illinois
policy
refusing
foster
care
payments,
the
persons
who
cared
for
children
who
were
related
to
them
and
to
the
children
themselves.
illinois
based
its
policy
of
refusing
foster
care
payments
to
relatives
upon
its
determination
first
that
assistance
had
always
been
provided
to
related
person
and
to
children
under
the
basic
afdc
program
contained
in
section
406
to
the
social
security
act.
and
secondly,
upon
the
determination
that
section
408
of
the
social
security
act
define
those
eligible
for
foster
care
benefits
as
caretakers
and
children
who
are
unrelated
to
each
other.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
caretakers
and
children
who
are
related
to
each
other
and
thus
are
denied
foster
care
benefits
under
illinois'
policy.
their
complaint
alleged
the
course
of
action
that
the
illinois
scheme
was
in
violation
of
their
fourteenth
amendment
rights
to
equal
protection.
the
department
of
children
and
family
services
filed
a
motion
to
strike
and
dismiss
the
plaintiff's
complaint
which
the
three-judge
court
which
was
in
panel
to
hear
this
case
treated
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
illinois
policy
of
denying
foster
care
benefits
to
children
who
are
related
to
their
caretakers
was
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
that
case
was
appealed
directly
to
this
court
and
the
plaintiff
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
urged
in
addition
to
their
equal
protection
claim
for
the
very
first
time
that
the
illinois
policy
or
scheme
of
denying
foster
care
benefits
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
social
security
act
and
therefore
there
was
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
because
this
claim
had
not
previously
been
presented
to
the
three-judge
court,
this
court
reversed
the
three-judge
court's
decision
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
three-judge
court
for
consideration
of
this
issue.
on
remand,
the
single
judge
of
the
district
court
found
that
the
illinois
scheme
of
the
denying
foster
care
benefits
to
related
caretakers
was
inconsistent
with
the
social
security
act
and
therefore
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
the
department
of
children
and
family
services
appealed
this
decision
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
determination.
the
department
of
children
and
family
services
then
filed
its
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
and
subsequently
its
jurisdictional
statement
urging
that
its
policy
of
the
denying
foster
care
benefits
to
related
persons
was
consistent
with
the
social
security
act
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
the
21st
of
february
1978.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
there
are
other
states
which
follow
illinois'
lead.
i
believe
that
the
briefs
indicate
that
there
are
six
or
seven
states
who
are
doing
this.
i
believe,
however,
that
the
majority
of
states
who
are
involve
in
the
program
now
take
the
contrary
position
that
is
that
foster
care
is
maybe
related
care.
the
issue
in
this
case
i
think
maybe
simply
stated
as
our
children
who
are
related
to
their
caretakers
and
children
themselves
eligible
for
foster
care
assistance
under
section
408
of
the
social
security
act.
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
involves
essentially
a
question
of
statutory
construction
and
it's
also
our
position
that
section
408
of
the
social
security
act
by
its
clear
terms
indicates
that
foster
care
means
unrelated
care.
since
our
case
turns
entirely
upon
a
proper
reading
of
the
statute,
i
would
like
to
devote
the
reminder
of
my
time
to
a
reading
of
the
statute
to
show
the
court
what
we
believed
to
be
the
clear
indication
in
the
statute
itself
that
foster
care
is
unrelated
care.
the
statute
is
contained
in
an
appendix,
our
jurisdictional
statement.
this
appendix
say
in
section
608
is
contained
at
page
a6
of
that
appendix
and
that
is
what
i
want
to
devote
my
argument
to
if
i
may.
section
608
is
entitled
"payment
to
states
for
foster
home
care
of
dependent
children;
definitions".
on
paragraph
(a)
terms
or
defines
i
should
say
the
term
dependent
child.
it
reads
as
follows,
“the
term
dependent
child'
shall,
notwithstanding
section
606(a)
of
this
title,
also
include
a
child.”
now,
i
would
like
to
focus
if
i
may
on
two
words
in
one
of
the
phrases
that
are
used
in
those
first
two
lines.
the
first
word
is
the
word
notwithstanding.
notwithstanding
according
to
its
common
usage
means
in
spite
of.
so,
the
term
dependent
child
in
section
608
is
going
to
be
a
child
who
in
spite
of
section
606(b)
of
this
title.
now,
section
606
--
i'm
sorry
section
--
in
spite
of
section
606(a)
of
this
title.
now,
section
606(a)
is
the
regular
afdc
program
and
it
provides
that
the
children
will
be
eligible
for
assistance
if
they
live
with
specified
relative.
now,
if
section
608
which
defines
the
term
dependent
child
as
one
that
is
a
child
in
spite
of
the
definition
contained
in
section
606(a),
it
must
indicate
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
create
a
class
which
is
different
in
the
class
which
was
already
created
in
section
606.
we
read
that
of
course
since
the
child
who
was
eligible
in
606
was
a
child
who
was
living
with
specified
relative,
we
read
that
as
being,
the
section
608
child
as
being
someone
who
is
not
living
with
a
specified
relative.
congress
also
chose
the
word,
chose
to
include
the
word
also
that
is
after
the
term
dependent
child
shall
notwithstanding
section
606(a)
of
this
title.
i
said
it
shall
also
include
a
child.
now,
the
word
"also"
as
it's
commonly
used
means
in
addition
to,
besides
or
as
well
as.
so,
the
definition
in
608
of
dependent
child
is
a
definition
in
addition
to
or
besides
or
as
well
as
the
definition
on
section
606(a).
again,
since
the
definition
in
606(a)
requires
a
dependent
child
to
be
living
with
the
specified
relative,
the
definition
in
section
608
must
be
something
different,
and
we
contend
again
that's
further
indication
that
the
differences
that
the
child
is
going
to
be
unrelated
to
his
caretaker
in
section
608.
paragraph
one
indicates
that
the
term
dependent
child
shall
notwithstanding
section
608(a)
of
this
title
also
include
to
child
and
one
reads,
“who
would
meet
the
requirements
of
such
section
606(a)
except
for
his
removal
from
the
home
of
relative
specified
in
section
606(a).
so
under
paragraph
(a)1,
a
dependent
trial
is
a
child
who
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
606,
shall
include
also
a
child
who
would
be
eligible
under
section
606
but
for
his
removal
from
the
home
of
a
specified
relative.
we
submit
that
this
is
again
an
indication
of
the
fact
that
congress
intended
to
create
a
new
class
of
persons
here
on
the
section
608,
and
that
new
class
of
persons
were
going
to
be
eligible
for
care
are
persons
who
are
unrelated
to
the
persons
for
whom,
or
by
whom
they
are
given
care.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that's
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
our
position.
one
of
the
reasons
so
we
take
that
position
is
that
the
children
who
were
removed
from
the
home
of
a
relative
pursuant
to
a
judicial
determination
that
that
home
was
no
longer
fit
where
all
this
children
who
are
eligible
for
assistance
under
the
basic
afdc
program
contained
in
section
606.
congress
did
not
need
to
pass
section
608
in
order
to
provide
illegibility
for
children
who
were
removed
from
the
home
of
one
relative
pursuant
to
a
judicial
determination
and
placed
in
the
home
of
another
relative.
those
kinds
of
children
were
always
covered
under
the
basic
afdc
program.
it's
our
position
then
since
congress
didn't
need
to
do
that,
it
must
have
been
their
intention
to
create
new
class
of
persons
who
would
be
eligible
for
assistance.
that
new
class
of
persons
of
course
are
persons
who
are
unrelated
to
their
caretakers
because
they
were
never
eligible
for
assistance
under
the
basic
afdc
program.
and
i
--
and
i
might
add
congress
too
through
out
the
definition
of
dependent
child
here
has
contrasted
the
definition
of
dependent
child
in
section
608
with
the
definition
of
dependent
child
in
section
606
and
i
think
that
contrast
was
intended
to
demonstrate
that
the
class
of
children
who
are
going
to
be
eligible
for
assistance
under
section
608
is
a
different
class
than
the
one
on
the
section
606.
now,
on
page
a7
on
the
brief
at
paragraph
(b),
the
congress
has
also
defined
the
term
aid
the
families
with
dependent
children.
and
they
do
that
in
the
same
fashion
that
they
have
defined
the
term
dependent
child
on
paragraph
(a).
they
say
the
term
make
the
families
with
dependent
children
shall
notwithstanding
section
606(b)
of
this
title
include
also,
foster
care
on
behalf
of
a
child
described
in
paragraph
(a).
the
term
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
in
section
606(b)
which
is
the
basic
afdc
program
means,
aid
to
a
family
who
is
taking
care
of
a
child
who
is
related
to
that
family.
if
this
section
notwithstand
--
if
section
606
which
is
the
new
program,
the
foster
care
program
is
created
notwithstanding
section
606(b),
again,
it
must
be
another
indication
that
congress
intended
to
create
a
new
class
of
persons
and
again
that
new
class
of
persons
are
families
who
are
not
related
to
the
children
that
they
live
with.
now,
i
think
too
that
the
plaintiffs
recognized
in
this
case,
that
that
language
notwithstanding
section
606(a)
or
notwithstanding
section
606(b).
in
the
term
also,
presents
a
problem
to
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
i
would
say
that
because
they
define
section
608(b)
that
is
--
they
defined
the
term
aid
to
families
with
the
dependent
children
at
page
35
of
their
brief
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
the
way
they
do
that.
page
35
at
the
bottom
of
their
appellee's
brief
quotes,
from
congress'
statute
section
608(b)
they
say
it's
given
a
specific
meaning
and
the
meaning
that
they
give
it
read
as
follows,
they
say,
“the
term
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
shall
include
foster
care
in
behalf
of
a
child
describe
in
paragraph
(a)
of
this
section.”
what's
significant
about
that
is
that
they
have
deleted
the
very
language
which
i
say
indicates
congress'
intention
to
create
a
new
class
of
children.
it
reads
the
term
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
shall
and
then
the
phrase
notwithstanding
section
606(b)
is
deleted.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i'm
sorry,
your
honor
i
don't
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
our
position
--
our
position
is
that
eligibility
is
defined
in
section
608
in
terms
of
a
dependent
child
or
family
with
whom
that
child
is
living.
once
that
child
is
eligible,
that
child
may
be
eligible
for
foster
care
in
a
family
home
or
maybe
eligible
for
foster
care
in
child
care
institution.
what
i
am
focusing
on
and
what
this
case
is
all
about
in
my
estimation
is,
who
is
eligible
for
the
benefits
which
were
provided
for
in
section
608.
and
i
am
saying
that
congress
defines
who
is
eligible,
when
they
defined
the
term
dependent
child
and
when
defined
it
is
being
a
new
definition
notwithstanding
the
old
definition
which
was
contained
in
the
basic
afdc
program.
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
again
that
the
plaintiffs
exclude
in
their
reading
of
that
definition.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
why
--
why
is
what
not
included,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
do
not
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
our
--
our
positions
that
are
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
our
position
is
we
will
not
pay
them
because
congress
did
not
define
them
as
a
class
which
was
eligible
for
assistance
under
section
608
of
this
program.
they
are
eligible
for
assistance
under
section
606
by
its
literal
terms
and
they've
always
been
eligible
under
section
606
by
its
literal
terms.
congress
created
a
new
class
of
persons
in
section
608,
a
class
of
person
who
were
formerly
ineligible
to
receive
any
benefits.
before
section
608
was
created,
any
child
who
was
unable
to
live
with
the
relatives
specified
in
section
606
was
ineligible
for
afdc,
could
receive
no
benefits
whatsoever,
no
matter
how
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
607
requires
that
a
child
lives
with
a
specified
relative
again,
and
be
deprived
of
parental
support
because
of
his
father's
unemployment.
that's
precisely
our
point.
under
those
programs,
a
child
would
be
eligible
for
assistance
if
he
had
the
ability
to
live
with
a
specified
relative.
but
children
who
could
not
leave
with
the
relative,
were
not
eligible
for
any
assistance
at
all
and
when
the
congress
passed
this
program
it's
our
position
that
they
did
it
with
the
intension
of
benefiting
a
class
of
children
who
were
previously
ineligible
for
any
kind
of
assistance
at
all.
as
the
solicitor
general
points
on
in
his
brief
too,
i
might
add,
there
was
no
controversy
in
this
case
until
the
monitory
benefits
for
foster
care
where
increased
beyond
what
the
basic
the
afdc
program
provided
for.
but
when
this
program
was
initially
enacted
in
1961,
that
is
the
foster
care
program,
when
in
was
initially
acted
--
enacted
in
1961,
the
benefits
as
i
understand
were
precisely
the
same
for
the
basic
program
as
they
were
for
the
foster
care
program.
now,
it
seems
to
me
if
the
benefits
were
the
same,
when
the
program
was
created
and
they
weren't
increased
until
1967.
if
the
benefits
were
the
same
that
must
indicate
that
congress
intended
at
that
time
to
benefit
a
new
class
of
persons.
one
who
had
been
previously
without
any
kind
of
assistance
at
all,
because
the
benefits
were
precisely
the
same.
at
any
rate,
my
point
is
that
the
way
that
the
plaintiffs
can
wind
up
being
eligible
for
assistance
under
this
program
is
to
exclude
the
language
which
i
said
as
they
have
done
at
page
35
of
their
brief.
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
foster
care
or
in
order
for
the
state
to
be
able
to
receive
matching
benefits
for
foster
care,
they
have
to
under
section
608(f),
they
have
to
provide
a
program
which
is
designed
to
improve
the
conditions
in
the
home
from
which
the
child
was
removed
or
to
otherwise
make
possible,
as
being
place
on
a
home
of
a
relative
specified
in
section
606(a)
of
this
title.
it's
our
position
that
if
the
state
has
to
provide
a
program
which
will
put
a
child,
take
a
child
out
of
foster
care
and
put
him
in
the
home
of
a
specified
relative
that
has
no
significance
or
no
meaning
if
the
child
was
already
in
the
home
of
a
relative
because
the
goal
of
section
608
is
then
satisfied.
that
is
--
that
is
to
say,
that
a
child
--
there
is
no
purpose
or
point
in
taking
a
child
out
of
the
home
of
one
relative
and
putting
him
in
the
home
of
another
relative.
this
--
this
language
of
congress
in
section
608(f)
in
our
view
has
no
significance
whatever.
if
the
statute
is
interpreted
to
permit
foster
care
by
relatives,
it
has
no
meaning.
based
upon
our
reading
of
the
statute
and
the
reading
which
i
have
attempted
to
engage
in
here
before
the
court,
it's
our
position
that
foster
care
means
unrelated
care.
it's
clear
even
if
it's
implicit
in
the
statute.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
do
i
think
it
means
unrelated
care
in
the
ordinary
vernacular?
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
did
until
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
pardon?
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no,
no,
until
i
read
the
dictionary
definitions,
not
until
i
read
the
statues.
it's
clear
in
my
mind
that
congress
intended
foster
care
to
be
unrelated
care,
because
of
the
way
that
defined
the
term
dependent
child
and
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
i
think
that
the
term
foster
care
may
vary
from
person
to
person
or
individual
to
individual.
as
the
plaintiffs
point
out,
foster
may
imply
the
relationship
between
a
child
and
his
caretaker
that
is
anyone
who
provides
what
the
mother
or
father
would
provide
with
be
considered
to
be
a
foster
parent.
i
will
concede
that
that's
true
but
i
don't
think
that
our
case
turns
on,
on
that
understanding.
we
rely
on
the
plain
language
that
congress
used
in
the
social
security
act
and
it's
our
position
that
based
upon
that
language
and
our
reading
of
it,
which
i
think
is
not
a
selective
reading
but
a
fair
reading,
foster
care
means
unrelated
care.
in
order
for
the
plaintiffs
to
include
themselves
in
this
category,
to
make
themselves
eligible,
they
have
to
engage
in
a
selective
reading
of
the
statutes.
they
have
to
read
out
words
and
phrases
because
they
can't
read
them
consistently
and
make
all
the
terms
and
all
the
provisions
of
the
foster
care
statute
have
significance
or
make
or
sense.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal
and
i
would
simply
ask
the
court
that
they
reverse
the
judgment
in
order
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
would
like
to
make
one
brief
comment
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
would
simply
like
to
reaffirm
that
our
position
that
unrelated
persons
are
not
eligible
for
foster
care.
it
is
based
upon
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
employed
by
congress
in
the
statute.
eligibility
is
defined
in
terms
of
a
dependent
child
or
families
with
dependent
children,
not
in
terms
of
foster
care.
foster
care
is
the
thing
that
a
dependent
child
or
an
eligible
family
or
eligible
for
and
that's
the
thing
that
the
plaintiffs
overlooked.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one,
if
i
may,
one
thing
that
the
plaintiff's
reading
of
this
statute
could
result
in
which
congress
obviously
never
intended.
section
606
which
provides
a
specification
of
certain
relatives
includes
as
a
relative
specified
relative,
a
mother
or
a
father,
that
is
a
child
can
be
living
with
his
mother
or
father
or
certain
other
relative
and
be
eligible
for
basic
afdc
assistance.
if
a
brother
or
a
sister
can
be
a
foster
parent
under
section
408
then
there
is
no
reason
that
a
mother
or
a
father
cannot
be
a
foster
parent
if
they
otherwise
meet
the
eligibility
criteria
because
they
are
also
one
of
the
specified
relatives
contained
in
section
606
which
section
608
is
written
notwithstanding
or
in
spite
of.
so,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
plaintiff's
construction
of
this
statute
would
result
in
at
least
that
foolish
result
and
i
would
again
respectfully
request
that
the
court
reverse
the
determination
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
