mr.
robert
e.
lehrer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
a
neglected
or
abused
child
judicially
taken
from
his
own
home
may
be
deprived
to
federal
foster
care
benefits
solely
because
the
state
then
places
him
in
a
home
of
his
relative.
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
with
the
children
here
says
that
congress
intended
no
such
deprivation.
illinois
says,
“the
congress
intended
precisely
that
deprivation
by
affirming
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
here,
this
court
will
effectuate
congress'
intent,
these
neglected
or
abused
children
be
cared
for
under
the
federal
foster
care
program
which
was
intended
to
assure
this
children
the
most
suitable
out
of
home
care
for
them.”
now,
the
state
defendant
says
the
benefits
here
are
the
same
and
tries
to
make
the
program
served
--
duplicate
assistant
programs.
programs
did
not
provide
duplicate
assistance
today
and
they
did
not
provide
it
in
1961.
section
408
provides
in
section
f
and
in
the
service
components
of
the
licensing
standards
a
range
of
social
services
which
is
specifically
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
neglected
or
abused
children
who
have
been
removed
from
their
own
homes
and
made
state
wards.
these
services
are
provided
to
assure
the
child
proper
care
and
the
foster
family
home
or
child
care
institution
in
which
he
is
placed
and
also
are
provided
to
the
child
and
to
the
parents
from
which
--
from
whom
he
was
taken
in
order
to
affect
the
reunification
of
the
family.
mr.
robert
e.
lehrer
no,
your
honor
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
case.
the
character
of
those
services
applies
to
a
class
of
children
who
have
been
abused
or
neglected
in
their
own
homes
not
just
to
abused
and
neglected
children
who
have
been
placed
in
the
homes
of
non-relatives.
the
services
provide,
the
required
services
under
the
federal
act
require
an
individualized
social
service
plan
to
assure
the
child
proper
care
in
the
home
in
which
she
is
placed
and
also
provide
for
services
to
not
only
him
but
to
the
parents,
the
home
from
which
she
was
removed
in
order
to
effectuate
a
reunification
of
the
family.
the
character
of
those
services
is
no
less
applicable
to
children
who
are
placed
with
relatives
and
those
who
are
placed
with
non-relatives.
it's
just
as
much
in
need
to
--
they're
just
in
much
in
need
to
remedy
the
neglect
the
deprivation
of
children
placed
in
relatives
by
effecting
a
reunification
of
the
family
as
children
placed
with
non-relatives.
so
no,
the
service
component
here
which
is
not
only
reflected
in
f
but
also
reflected
in
the
licensing
or
approval
standards
is
responsive
to
the
abuse
or
neglect
and
that's
not
--
it
doesn't
go
along
to
children
who
are
placed
in
non-related
homes.
for
instance,
the
service
component
of
the
licensing
standards
which
all
states
under
f
are
required
to
apply
to
eligible
children
and
which
illinois
applies
to
the
related
homes
here
--
mr.
robert
e.
lehrer
well,
the
definitions
of
eligible
children
come
from
606(a)
but
it
turns
at
least
in
part
or
eventually
on
the
last
paragraph
of
608(a)
because
the
state's
contention
here
is
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted.
state
says
in
its
brief
turns
on
the
statutory
definition
of
foster
family
home
in
section
608(a)
--
mr.
robert
e.
lehrer
most
certainly,
your
honor,
and
what
section
608(a)
is
doing
is
to
--
is
defining
a
--
is
establishing
a
new
program
and
setting
forth
new
eligibility
standards
which
a
child
may
meet
and
be
a
dependent
child.
it's
redefining
the
term
dependent
child.
mr.
robert
e.
lehrer
no,
if
i
understand
your
question
properly,
the
language
that
defendant
makes
so
much
of
his
language
that
supports
the
conclusion
of
the
children
here
are
eligible.
what
section
608
is
doing,
section
408
of
the
act
is
doing,
is
to
make
irrelevant
the
definition
in
606.
that's
what
notwithstanding
suggests,
that
here,
notwithstanding
the
definition
of
dependent
child
in
406.
here
is
a
new
set
of
eligibility
criterion,
which
--
mr.
robert
e.
lehrer
from
section
608,
oh,
yes,
except
that
i
think
as
the
defendants
takes
time
to
point
out
that
the
statutory
definition
does
have
to
be
interpreted
in
the
context
of
its
statutory
environment
particularly
section
601,
section
42
u.s.c.,
section
601
which
provides
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
program,
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
all
the
afdc
programs
is
to
encourage
the
care
of
dependent
children
in
their
own
homes
or
in
the
homes
of
relatives.
thus,
our
rights
straight
forward
we
do
have
to
turn
on
section
608
but
it
has
to
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
section
401
and
it's
the
state's
policy
here
which
frustrates
the
primary
purpose
of
all
the
afdc
programs.
what's
happening
here
is
you
have
congress
in
1956
amending
the
social
security
act
since
they
specifically
the
one
on
the
primary
purposes
of
all
the
afdc
programs
is
to
encourage
the
care
of
dependent
children
in
their
own
homes
or
in
the
homes
of
relatives
and
the
import
of
the
states'
position
is
that
five
years
later
congress
has
established
a
new
afdc
program
which
frustrates
precisely
those
goals.
and
it
frustrates
it
in
precisely
this
way
as
this
--
that
the
state's
policy
serves
as
a
disincentive
in
the
first
instance
for
relatives
to
care
dependent
children
has
happened
in
this
case.
it
has
happened
in
this
case,
the
youakims
were
discouraged
from
taking
care
of
children
who
are
related
to
them.
that's
the
first
way
that
discourages
as
the
primary
purpose
of
the
afdc
programs.
the
second
way
is
that
even
if
that
disincentive
is
overcome
and
the
children
are
as
they
were
here
placed
in
the
homes
of
relatives
then
the
state
policy
denies
them
to
service
specified
in
section
608(f)
designed
precisely
to
reunify
the
family
as
its
placed
back
in
his
own
home.
it
is
most
unreasonable
to
read
section
6
--
section
408
of
the
act
to
frustrate
what
congress
five
years
previously
had
said
with
the
primary
purposes
of
all
the
afdc
programs.
so,
it
was
not
true
in
1961
and
it's
not
true
today
that
the
programs
provide
duplicate
assistance.
although
as
defendant
points
out,
there
was
no
higher
federal
matching
rate
in
1961
for
these
benefits.
in
fact,
all
the
states
immediately
even
though
there
was
no
higher
federal
matching
rate,
immediately
began
paying
substantially
higher
benefits
and
this
reflects
the
recognition
by
the
states
that
what
was
meant
here
was
a
program
to
care
for
children
who
needed
special
remedial
care,
who
needed
more
benefits.
now
in
1967,
when
the
matching
rate
was
increased,
what
congress
said
in
providing
those
increased
matching
benefits
was
that
the
benefits
were
necessary
because
foster
care
was
more
costly
than
care
in
a
child's
home
and
also
that
it
was
responsive
to
the
needs
of
the
child
and
that's
what's
going
on
here.
congress
established
a
new
program
to
meet
the
needs
of
these
children.
these
children
who
have
been
especially
grown
up
in
unsuitable
environments
and
have
been
subject
to
abuse
or
neglect,
it's
a
remedial
program.
this
is
not
simply
a
program
for
children
who
don't
happen
to
have
a
relative
to
live
with.
in
fact,
which
is
what
defendant
is
arguing
would
suggest
in
fact
of
course
most
children
who
don't
have
relatives
to
live
with
aren't
eligible
for
the
foster
care
program.
this
was
not
a
new
comprehensive
program
to
take
care
of
children
who
didn't
happen
to
have
a
relative
to
live
with.
what
it
was
is
a
new
program
to
take
care
of
children
who
have
been
subject
to
abuse
or
neglect
in
their
own
homes.
and
it's
a
small
program
especially
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
children
unfortunate
enough
to
have
grown
up
in
those
sorts
of
environments.
in
illinois,
for
instance,
there
are
over
500,000
children
eligible
for
regular
afdc
benefits
but
the
entire
afdc
foster
care
program
includes
only
4,000
children.
so,
we're
talking
about
a
small
group
of
children
here.
now,
defendants
placed
great
reliance
on
the
statute
and
we
think
they
are
proper
to
place
great
reliance
on
the
statute
but
they
draw
the
wrong
conclusions
for.
the
statute
very
persuasively
as
the
solicitor
points
out
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
children
here
are
eligible
for
foster
care
benefits.
we
discussed
the
statute
at
length
in
our
brief
but
there
are
four
points
that
merit
emphasis
here.
first
is
the
statutory
definition
of
foster
family
home.
second
is
the
specification
that
afdc
shall
include
foster
care
to
an
eligible
child
in
the
foster
family
home
of
any
individual.
third
is
the
provision
within
the
statutory
definition
that
foster
family
homes
in
which
eligible
children
are
placed
may
be
approved
as
meeting
licensing
standards.
this
is
a
provision
which
is
specifically
applicable
to
homes,
to
states
in
which
relative
homes
are
not
licensed.
and
fourth,
in
section
402(a)(19)(f),
a
related
provision
of
the
act
which
constitutes
a
specific
congressional
recognition
of
a
relative
home
as
a
foster
family
home.
first,
the
statutory
definition
of
foster
family
home,
defendant
dismisses
the
significance
of
this
because
of
the
statutory
definitions
repetition
of
the
defined
term
foster
family
home
in
the
definition
itself.
i'm
reading
now
from
the
last
paragraph
of
section
408.
in
fact,
the
repetition
of
the
terms
suggest
a
congressional
weariness
that
any
paraphrase
of
that
term
might
be
read
to
restrict
the
states'
authority
to
place
a
child
in
the
home
which
it
might
deemed
most
suitable
and
thus
that
the
only
restrictions
on
foster
family
homes
are
those
the
state
places
on
the
home
itself
in
terms
of
the
homes'
suitability.
but
that
aside,
mr.
justice
white,
you
look
a
bit
confused,
i'm
sorry
okay.
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you'd
ask
a
question.
but
the
use
of
the
defined
term
foster
family
home
has
no
reason
to
stop
reading
the
definition.
the
definition
goes
on
to
say
that
a
foster
family
must
at
least
be
a
home
for
children
and
it
must
be
licensed
or
approved
by
the
state.
the
purpose
of
the
licensing
or
approval
requirement
was
to
assure
that
the
homes
in
which
eligible
children
were
placed
met
state
qualitative
standards
and
it's
state
standards
which
must
govern
their
suitability.
in
illinois
as
in
all
states,
caretakers
of
state
foster
children
and
their
homes
are
required
to
and
do
meet
the
same
qualitative
standards
as
applied
to
homes
caring
for
non-relative
foster
children.
and
these
qualitative
standards
which
i've
reviewed
summarily
before
mandate
that
the
home
meet
specified
safety
and
health
standards
and
prescribe
minimum
safety
requirements
and
the
caretakers
themselves
must
meet
certain
--
must
pass
inspection
as
to
their
health
and
their
overall
fitness
to
care
for
these
children.
in
short,
except
for
purposes
of
afdc
foster
care
eligibility,
illinois
deems
the
related
caretakers
here
to
be
foster
parents
just
in
the
same
manners
as
it
does
to
unrelated
caretakers.
defendants
continued
cate
--
grouped
the
related
caretakers
here
with
the
relatives
under
the
regular
afdc
program.
but
in
fact,
the
relatives
here
and
the
homes
here
just
aren't
any
relatives
and
they
aren't
any
homes.
these
are
relatives
and
homes
which
have
been
especially
approved
by
the
state
under
state
law
to
be
suitable
for
the
care
of
children
who
have
been
abused
and
neglected
in
their
own
homes
and
then
taken
from
those
homes
and
made
state
wards.
so,
the
grouping
that
defendants
try
to
effectuate
is
belied
by
its
own
law
and
its
own
practice
and
policy.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
in
this
context,
in
the
context
of
this
statutory
definition
of
foster
family
home
which
is
the
determinative
term
in
the
case.
in
that
context,
the
state's
argument
really
rests
upon
a
proposition
that
congress
meant
to
simply
exclude
them,
exclude
relative
homes
from
the
meaning
of
foster
family
homes
in
the
first
instance
but
as
in
response
to
mr.
chief
justice
burger's
question,
counsel
concede
that
that,
in
fact,
the
ordinary
use
of
the
word
may
often
carry
with
it
and
usually
does
carry
with
it
as
we
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief
the
meaning
of
relative
care.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
court's
previous
opinion
in
this
case,
it
used
the
term
related
foster
care
and
related
foster
parents,
related
foster
home
without
any
apparent
ease
or
strain
associated
with
that
term.
that's
the
common
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
and
that's
the
meaning
which
congress
attributed
to
it
in
the
foster
care
statute.
second
point
in
the
statute
which
i
emphasize
is
section
408(b)
which
refers
to
the
afdc,
term
afdc
shall
notwithstanding
section
606(b)
of
this
title
include
also
foster
care
in
behalf
of
the
child
described
in
the
foster
family
home
of
any
individual
and
the
term
of
any
individual
explicates
the
term
foster
family
home.
it
demonstrates
what's
otherwise
clear
from
the
legislative
history
and
from
the
logic
of
the
statute,
that
congress
meant
to
include
any
individual
the
state
might
deem
to
be
a
suitable
caretaker
for
its
foster
children
as
afdc
foster
parents.
what
individuals
might
be
afdc
foster
parents,
section
408(b)
when
read
with
the
statutory
definition
says
that
any
individuals
may
be
so
long
as
the
state
deems
them
suitable
under
its
licensing
standards
which
illinois
does
for
relatives.
finally,
there
is
the
--
or
third
there
is
the
approval
provision
in
section
4
--
in
the
last
paragraph
of
section
408
which
provides
that
a
foster
family
home
maybe
either
licensed
or
approved
as
meeting
licensing
standards.
legislative
history
does
not
indicate
specifically
why
this
approval
of
procedure
was
included
--
alternate
approval
procedure
was
included
in
the
statute.
but
we
do
know
that
in
1961,
as
today,
several
states
exclude
relative
homes
from
licensing
in
the
first
instance
and
in
that
light,
it's
most
logical
to
read
that
insertion
of
the
approval
procedure
as
congress'
effort,
congress'
mandate
that
children
placed
in
such
homes,
that
those
homes
meet
the
same
standards
as
were
applied
to
homes
which
were
licensed
under
state
law.
in
this
context,
the
approval
requirement
emergence
with
congress'
means
of
insuring
that
the
children
placed
in
those
homes,
in
their
relative
homes
would
receive
the
same
benefit
as
children
placed
in
homes
which
weren't
licensed.
but
there
obviously
would
have
been
no
reason
for
congress
to
include
that
alternative
provision
unless
it
intended
that
children
place
in
relative
homes
would
be
eligible
for
the
foster
care
program.
fourth
point
in
the
statute,
which
i
have
emphasized,
we
do
discuss
others
in
our
brief
but
the
four
points
in
this
statute
would
emphasize
this
section
402(a)(19)(f)
which
we
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief
and
i
wont
review
that
in
detail
here
but
that
does
constitute
a
specific
congressional
recognition
of
a
relative
home
as
a
foster
family
home.
mr.
robert
e.
lehrer
well,
the
state
is
given
authority
under
its
licensing
standards
to
approve
certain
classifications
of
individuals
as
suitable
caretakers
or
not.
a
state
might
well
decide
and
precisely
right
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
it's
precisely
not
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
a
state
might
decide
that
for
purposes
of
institutional
care,
it
might
not
be
appropriate
to
have
a
grandmother
or
any
relative
care
for
that
child
in
that
setting
because
she
might
show
favoritism,
maybe
against
the
child
or
maybe
for
the
child.
the
question
is
not
presented
in
this
case
about
whether
a
state
might
deem
relatives
to
be
not
suitable
caretakers.
illinois
does
deem
relatives
to
be
suitable
caretakers.
hope
that
has
answered
the
question
but
section
402(a)(19)(f)
which
we
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief,
you
first
specifically
to
continuing
either
protective
payments
or
foster
care
payments
to
a
child
in
the
home,
in
a
home
of
a
relative
who
refuses
to
cooperate
in
the
win
program.
it
didn't
mean
to
suggest
in
the
brief
that
the
state
might
not
make
other
alternative
dispositions
with
respect
to
a
child
in
a
home
of
a
non-cooperating
relative
but
that
provision
does
limit
the
states'
remedial
action
to
a
dependent
child
to
either
continuing
foster
care
in
a
home
of
relative
or
it's
going
to
continue
afdc
outside
the
home
to
a
--
limiting
it
to
foster
care
which
must
mean
that
it
must
be
continued
in
any
home
in
which
the
child
is
placed
and
that
does
constitute
a
specific
congressional
recognition
of
a
relative
home
as
a
foster
family
home.
finally,
hew's
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute
unequivocally
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
children
here
are
eligible
for
federal
foster
care
benefits.
we
have
not
emphasized
it
here
because
it
emphasizes
itself.
it
is
the
interpretation
by
an
agency
which
is
charged
with
enforcing
the
foster
care
statute
and
indeed
was
at
least
cooperated
in
proposing
and
establishing
the
foster
care
program
in
the
first
instance.
moreover,
this
interpretation
has
been
a
matter
of
public
record
and
prominently
so
for
over
four
years
--
mr.
robert
e.
lehrer
fourteen
years
and
i
think
the
reason
why
there
was
a
lapse,
why
there
was
not
an
articulated
policy
prior
to
‘74
though
the
solicitor
notes
the
operative
policy.
it
was
in
fact
in
effect
prior
to
‘74.
the
reason
why
it
is,
it
supports,
again,
the
conclusion
that
the
children
here
are
eligible
it's
precisely
because
the
fact
of
whether
children
were
placed
in
relative
homes
or
non-relative
homes
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
foster
care
program
in
the
sense
that
the
states
are
given,
the
placement
authority.
congress
in
the
foster
care
statute
delegated
the
states
the
right
to
make
that
placement
which
it
deemed
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
so,
the
federal
government
wasn't
reviewing
these
individual
placement
decisions.
this
is
not
like
the
ordinary
situations
where
it
sometimes
comes
up
in
afdc
cases
wherein
the
state
plan
one
must
specify
that
you're
not
providing
benefits
to
children,
let's
say,
between
18
and
21.
there
was
no
necessity
or
need
for
the
states
to
make
that
specification,
so
there
would
have
been
no
hew
review
to
those
kinds
of
decisions
and
it
only
came
to
light
i
think
when
following
two
district
court
decisions,
federal
district
court
decisions
in
early
1971
which
brought
this
fact
that
a
few
states
were
not
considering
children
placed
in
related
care
to
be
eligible.
and
at
that
point,
hew
fairly
promptly
issued
an
instruction
mandating
what
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
act
and
its
own
regulations
was.
in
conclusion,
section
408
in
common
sense,
common
sense
in
terms
of
what
congress
must
have
intended
in
light
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
afdc
program
and
in
light
of
the
traditional
suitability
of
relative
care
in
our
society
which
the
state
policy
here
frustrates
and
deters.
the
statute
itself,
in
common
sense,
point
decisively
towards
that
reading
of
section
408
making
the
children
here
eligible
for
foster
care
and
decisively
against
the
conclusion,
the
congress
meant
to
discourage
the
care
of
neglected
or
abused
children
by
their
relatives
and
deny
them
the
higher
benefits
and
specialized
social
services
which
were
necessary
to
remedy
the
abuse
and
neglect
to
which
they
have
been
subject.
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
says
that,
that
reading
of
the
statute
making
the
children
here
eligible
is
the
correct
reading.
it
is
the
correct
reading
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
