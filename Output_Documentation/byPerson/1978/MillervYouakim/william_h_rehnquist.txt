justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
that
you're
--
you
are
saying
that
the
language
except
for
his
removal
from
a
home
by
judicial
decree
suggests
that
606(a)
would
exclude
those
people
and
in
such
a
way
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
--
well,
doesn't
608
have
in
the
very
language
you
just
quote
suggests
that
congress
was
thinking
about
2
different
classes
of
children
in
608
and
606?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
definition
of
eligible
children
comes
from
606(a),
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
it
also
turn
on
the
definition
of
the
dependent
child
in
608(a)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
--
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
that
your
opponent
relies
on
in
the
first
part
of
section
608(a)
there,
that
a
dependent
child
shall
also
include
a
child
who
would
meet
the
requirements
of
section
606(a)
or
section
607
except
for
his
removal
from
a
home
of
a
relative?
does
that
suggest
to
you
that
a
child
who
is
removed
from
a
home
of
a
relative
by
a
judicial
decree
would
not
except
for
608
meet
the
requirements
of
606
or
607?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
you
get
all
your
rights
from
section
608.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
years
are
left
between
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
a
promulgation
of
the
regulation?
