justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
draw
off
from
freedom
of
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
your
man
here
is
arrested
for
--
not
what
for
what
he
said
but
for
what
he
didn't
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
caballero,
could
i
just
ask
this,
you
didn't
challenge
the
lawfulness
of
the
stop
in
this
case,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
lawfulness
then
we
assume?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
didn't
challenge
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
go
up
a
step
further,
what
about
after
the
trial?
did
you
argue
that
it
was
a
not
a
lawful
stop?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
its
face
is
bad
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
we
do
with
your
argument
if
we
should
view
the
--
there's
no
element
of
dangerousness
in
the
situation
as
i
remember
the
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
our
view
would
be
that
this
did
not
come
within
terry?
what
do
we
do
with
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
my
question
but
maybe
that's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
make
any
difference
when
we
in
fact
view
the
stop
is
lawful
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
concede
--
for
the
purpose
of
our
decision
you
concede
it's
a
lawful
stop,
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you'd
also
--
can
assume
for
first
a
decision
that
every
judge
who
has
to
read
this
statute
would
know
what
the
terry
standard
is
and
what
limit
the
application
of
the
statute
to
those
cases
which
followed
in
the
terry
standard.
we
should
assume
that
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
doesn't
seem
very
vague
anymore
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
that
part
of
the
vagueness
whether
we
didn't
really
know
whether
they
limit
it
to
terry
stops
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
ask
you
a
question
on
that?
he
did
ask
the
question
as
mr.
justice
powell
pointed
out.
the
only
thing
he
wanted
to
do
was
stop
him
and
ask
him
his
name
and
the
officer
said,
"correct".
that's
on
page
28
and
he
says
the
same
thing
again
a
couple
of
pages
later.
i
really
have
two
problems
with
that.
can
you
--
does
not
the
record
show
the
absence
of
a
lawful
terry
stop
and
that's
the
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
then
if
that
is
true,
if
there
is,
as
we
can
read
the
records
that
there
isn't
any
indication
of
violence
and
no
motive
to
do
anything
but
ask
this
fellow's
name
when
he
happened
to
be
in
a
drug
area
and
he
happened
to
be
black
and
i
don't
know
which
is
more
significant
for
other
reason
for
the
stop.
but
do
we
just
ignore
that
then
or
do
we
--
and
what
can
be
done
if
it
is
not
actually
a
violation
of
the
statute
there's
no
appeal
in
texas
is
there
from
this
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
there
--
oh,
i
thought
because
they
weren't
involved.
that
there
was
no
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see,
if
there
had
been
a
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
--
but
the
judgment
here
is
not
reviewable
by
any
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
isn't
mr.
brown's
counsel
--
don't
we
then
have
to
assume
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
that
the
texas
court
which
is
the
final
court
construing
this
statute
has
held
it
applies
more
broadly
than
terry
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
hicks,
wasn't
that
because
the
person
just
generally
on
the
scene
wasn't
necessarily
in
custody
and
miranda
starts
when
the
person
being
questioned
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
was
actually
going
to
ask
you.
when
--
if
you
do
stop
a
person
and
get
him
down
is
he
in
custody
for
purposes
of
miranda
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
arrest
him,
you
say
i
place
you
under
arrest,
it
would
be
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
there's
a
distinction
between
a
stop
on
reasonable
suspicion
for
necessity
warning
and
an
informal
arrest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
a
man
was
stopped,
is
he
free
to
move
about
at
will
when
he's
been
stopped?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
he
free
to
move
about
when
he's
been
stopped
by
the
police?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
reason
for
a
distinction
in
terms
of
miranda,
the
reasons
behind
the
miranda
rule,
why
would
you
draw
that
line,
i
wonder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
voluntarily
came
but
you
don't
voluntarily
agree
to
be
stopped,
that
it's
a
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
voluntarily.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
my
hypothesis
isn't
there
--
isn't
a
terry
stop
involuntary?
there's
not
--
isn't
that
sort
of
a
--
