mr.
renea
hicks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
renea
hicks
and
i
represent
the
state
of
texas
on
this
appeal.
the
statute
challenged
here,
section
3802
of
the
texas
penal
code
and
just
generally
it
imposes
a
very
limited
duty
on
citizens
of
the
state
of
texas
in
a
very
narrowly
circumscribed
situations
to
a
police
in
their
investigatory
functions
and
indirectly
to
either
fellow
citizens
by
helping
to
possibly
preempt
crime
or
help
catch
those
who
have
just
committed
a
crime.
i
do
not
see
that
it
is
unconstitutional
under
any
of
the
four
grounds
that
were
raised
on
this
appeal.
the
first
amendment
issue
i
think
clearly
must
be
discarded
as
a
valid
grounds
for
invalidating
the
statute
because
to
invalidate
the
statute
because
--
saying
that
someone
has
a
first
amendment
right
to
silence
in
all
situations
just
would
lead
to
totally
unacceptable
results
throughout
our
society,
we
are
--
much
of
our
government
functions
on
requirements
that
people
respond
to
request
from
people
in
securities
and
exchange
matters,
in
food
and
drug
administration
matters
in
situations
like
that.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
see
that
that
would
be
a
first
amendment
problem.
it
seems
to
me
--
well,
it
could
be
a
first
amendment
problem
in
the
sense
of
impinging
someone
on
associational
rights
by
constantly
keeping
track
of
someone.
i
don't
think
this
statute
does
anything
like
that.
but
if
anything
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
general
due
process
from
the
statute
going
back
to
the
situation
in
defillippo
where
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
said
making
criminal,
that
conduct
is
â€“
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
by
that
i
meant
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
question.
this
court
has
held
in
numerous
kinds
of
cases
that
the
only
things
in
the
due
process
clause
are
not
rights
incorporated
from
the
first
10
amendments,
first
8
amendments.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
think
that's
so.
mr.
renea
hicks
this
statute
is
different
than
many
of
the
other
statutes
that
are
similar
to
this
in
that
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
says
someone
has
to
carry
identification
to
support
what
they
speak
to
the
officer.
in
other
words
there's
no
requirement
of
showing
a
validated
driver's
license
or
a
general
id
card.
it
just
says
a
person
must
report
his
name
and
residence
or
address
to
a
police
officer.
and
i
don't
think
the
word
report
in
this
instance
means
that
they
have
to
report
it
by
showing
proof
of
the
identification.
in
other
words,
if
someone
says
my
name
is
john
smith,
to
an
officer's
lawfully
requested
it,
the
officer
has
no
right
to
say,
"well,
prove
that
you're
john
smith".
and
he
has
no
right
to
arrest
the
person
unless
he
has
independent
ground
to
point
that
this
a
false
identification.
mr.
renea
hicks
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that.
the
statute
requires
that
there'll
be
a
lawful
stop.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
but
they
--
mr.
renea
hicks
well
it
may
not
be
an
unlawful
stop
but
i
do
think
that
the
word
lawful
stop
in
this
instance
has
--
carries
with
it
a
certain
technical
meaning,
the
terry
versus
ohio
type
of
stop.
mr.
renea
hicks
that
was
implicit
in
the
judgment
of
conviction.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
under
--
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
for
it
--
there
is
--
mr.
renea
hicks
i
understand
that.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
lawful
stop
requires
the
terry
versus
ohio
stop.
it
may
be
that
the
court
in
this
situation
did
not
read
it
that
way
but
it
is
not
in
the
appellate
court
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
it
is
possible
to
get
it
from
the
higher
court.
mr.
renea
hicks
correct.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
renea
hicks
that
is
my
argument
before
this
court.
it
is
possible
that
there
was
not
--
that
this
court
would
find
if
they
are
independently
reviewing
the
evidence
that
there
was
not
a
lawful
terry
versus
ohio
stop.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
i
don't
think
that
it's
--
the
issue
of
the
lawful
stop
has
constantly
been
pushed
to
the
background
by
mr.
brown
or
his
counsel.
and
it
is
not
really
before
this
court
whether
there
was
a
lawful
stop.
i
realized
under
thompson
versus
city
of
louisville,
this
court
has
said
that
it
can
be
a
denial
of
due
process
if
there's
no
evidence
to
support
a
conviction.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
understand
--
mr.
renea
hicks
it
was
not
--
it
was
covered
by
the
fact
that
mr.
brown's
attorney
said
that
he
assumed
that
there
was
a
lawful,
there
was
a
reason
to
stop.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
my
argument.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
think
that's
very
possible.
i
do
think
that
there
were
two
other
facts
--
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
there
is
but
there
wasn't
in
this
case.
mr.
renea
hicks
there
can
be
an
appeal
because
under
a
class
--
in
a
class,
say,
misdemeanor
there
can
be
a
fine
over
$100.00
--
mr.
renea
hicks
--
up
to
$200.00.
correct.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct.
well,
i
do
think
that
it's
very
well
that
there
may
not
have
been
a
lawful
stop
in
this
case.
i
--
i
can
only
go
back
to
the
position
--
mr.
renea
hicks
its
--
there
are
two
conclusions
that
--
two
possible
conclusions
that
could
be
drawn
i
think.
one
could
be
that
conclusion.
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
problem.
the
other
one
would
be,
i
would
think
that
the
court
misunderstood
or
misapplied
the
terry
doctrine.
the
court,
the
trial
court
did
not
apply
the
terry
doctrine
properly.
that
might
be
the
proper
one
and
i
believe
that
that
is
what's
supported
by
the
record.
the
reason
i
say
that
under
the
texas
stat
--
under
this
statute
--
mr.
renea
hicks
i'm
saying
that
this
court
very
well
might
find
that
there
was
not
a
lawful
stop
in
the
terry
versus
ohio
if
it
was
independently
reviewing
the
evidence
and
if
the
issue
was
clearly
presented
to
them.
i
do
think
that
the
texas
statute
requires
the
terry
versus
ohio
stop.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
again
i
think
that
the
other
--
there
is
another
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
and
that
is
that
it
was
misapplied,
the
terry
doctrine
was
misapplied.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
renea
hicks
in
this
case,
but
in
texas
statutes
for
instance
in
the
texas
code
construction
act
which
governs
to
the
texas
penal
code,
there
is
provision
in
the
texas
code
construction
act
which
says
that
if
terms
of
the
statute
have
a
technical
or
special
meaning
through
some
means
such
as
a
court
decision
such
as
terry
versus
ohio
--
doesn't
specifically
meets
in
terry
versus
ohio.
then
those
words
in
a
statute
are
to
be
given
that
construction.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct.
mr.
renea
hicks
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
the
limit
of
what
a
police
officer
could
ever
do.
mr.
renea
hicks
no.
as
i
--
i
believe
i
said
that
under
this
statute,
the
term
lawful
stop
is
limited
by
other
statutes
in
texas
that
construct
--
controlled
the
construction
that
the
state
court
to
be
able
to
give
these
statute
to
a
situation
that
there
being
a
terry
versus
ohio
stop.
i
--
since
terry
--
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
necessary
conclusion
from
what
i
just
said
about
this
construction
that
would
be
given
to
the
statute.
there
are
stops
that
might
not
have
meant
to
a
fourth
amendment
detention
that
would
be
turned
lawful
i
suppose.
i
mean,
policemen
constantly
are
patrolling
their
areas
checking
with
the
merchants
and
so
on.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes.
i
think
that
that
is
implicit
in
the
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
believe
that
that
is
one
of
the
factors
on
which
the
judge
based
his
conclusion
implicit
in
the
judgment
of
conviction
--
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
believe
it
is
your
honor.
that
is
my
point
that
there
--
there
are
--
there
is
some
evidence
on
the
point
of
whether
there
is
a
lawful
stop.
as
i
say,
this
court
reviewing
the
record
are
in
--
as
an
initial
trial
court
might
decide
that
there
was
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
a
lawful
stop.
but
there
were
two
factors
i
think.
one
was
that
it
was
a
high
drug
area.
the
other
factor
--
there
were
three
factors.
the
other
factor
was
that
these
people
were
in
an
unpaved
alley
and
the
other
factor
was
that
there
were
two
people
in
this
unpaved
valley
in
a
high
drug
problem
area
near
one
another.
now
in
the
--
those
three
factors
in
isolation
very
well
that
probably
are
not
a
lawful
stop
in
the
terry
versus
ohio
but
there
are
some
evidence
on
that
point.
and
that
is
the
reason
i
suggest
that
under
thompson
versus
louisville
the
conviction
could
not
be
reversed
because
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
point.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
because
a
judge
in
texas
may
have
applied
terry
versus
ohio
in
a
way
differently
than
this
court
might
have
that
that
means
that
that
court
were
saying
that
lawful
stop
means
something
different
in
texas
than
it
means
under
the
fourth
amendment
litigation
after
terry
versus
ohio.
mr.
renea
hicks
i'm
not
contending
that
it
can
make
it
a
crime.
that
is
correct.
i'm
not
contending
that
texas
has
done
that.
i
think
it
may
be
possible
--
mr.
renea
hicks
--
to
do
that.
mr.
renea
hicks
no.
i
would
not
say
that
that
would
have
been
a
lawful
stop
under
this
statute
then
i
would
say
that
there
could
have
been
no
evidence
to
support
a
conviction
in
that
situation.
mr.
renea
hicks
but
the
--
one
of
--
that
is
only
one
of
several
elements
in
the
statute.
again,
i
go
back
to
arguing
that.
it's
a
terry
versus
ohio
stop
that
is
suggested.
mr.
renea
hicks
that
is
correct.
there
would've
been
no
evidence
on
that
point.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
main
problems
in
this
case.
there
--
i
do
think
that
there
is
support
in
texas
law,
statutory
law
for
the
argument
that
this
is
a
terry
versus
ohio
stop
and
again
i
cite
the
texas
code
construction
at
which
governs
the
texas
penal
code
in
which
says
the
technical
terms
or
terms
that
have
acquired
a
special
meaning
retain
that
special
meaning
in
the
codes
of
texas.
and
there's
also
a
provision
that
texas
courts
are
to
construe
statutes
so
as
to
avoid
findings
unconstitutionality,
kind
of
black
literal
problem.
i
did
want
to
address
the
following
norwell
versus
connecticut
which
mr.
caballero
cited
as
supporting
his
first
amendment
argument
and
i
do
believe
the
reading
of
that
case
will
reflect
that
the
gentleman
that
was
convicted
of
disorderly
conduct
in
that
case
had
his
conviction
reversed
by
this
court
because
of
something
he
had
said.
it
was
his
--
his
convictions
was
not
--
mr.
renea
hicks
--
because
of
something
that
he
had
said.
mr.
renea
hicks
cincinnati,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
renea
hicks
it
was
because
--
it
was
a
first
amendment
question
because
it
--
the
record
reflected
in
that
case
that
he
was
convicted
for
what
he
had
said
not
for
violation
of
the
statute.
he
had
non-provocatively
responded
to
the
officers
accosting
him.
in
this
situ
--
in
this
case
the
record
reflects
that
he
was
arrested
simply
for
refusing
to
give
his
name
after
a
lawful
stop
by
the
police
officer.
i
did
want
to
also
distinguish
this
case
from
cases
such
as
(inaudible)
and
the
other
cases
that
have
held
vagrancy
statutes
unconstitutional
because
this
statute
punishes
conduct
not
status.
i
think
there's
an
important
difference
in
(inaudible),
that
the
statute
was
held
unconstitutionally
vague
because
underlying
that
decision
i
think
was
the
feeling
that
people
were
convicted
for
what
they
were
not
for
what
they
had
done.
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
situation
in
this
case.
i
also
wanted
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
mens
rea
requirement
in
the
statute
that
requires
an
intentional
refusal.
i
think
this
is
the
same
which
is
this
somewhat
from
the
defillippo
case
which
not
--
did
not
clearly
contained
a
mens
rea
requirement.
and
i
think
the
intentional
element
the
mens
rea
requirement
does
under
various
decision
of
this
court
say
the
statute
from
any
vagueness
that
this
court
not
find
otherwise.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
i
do
believe
that
is
a
valid
obligation
and
i
don't
--
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
and
i'd
--
as
i
say
i
believe
it
is
a
valid
statute
and
the
obligation
is
fair.
it's
not
asking
--
i
don't
believe
too
much
to
ask
citizens
in
these
narrowly
circumscribed
situations
to
aid
the
law
enforcement
community
in
investigating
possible
crimes.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct.
mr.
renea
hicks
if
there
is
not
reasonable
suspicion
i
believe
that
is
a
different
a
case
than
this
one.
and
i
believe
as
the
discussion
in
defillip
--
in
the
defillippo
argument
proceeding
this
one
indicating
that
it's
quite
possible
for
a
state
to
enact
the
statute,
making
it
a
crime
whether
there
is
a
lawful
stop
or
not
to
refuse
to
give
your
name.
mr.
renea
hicks
again,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
renea
hicks
i
don't
believe
i
said
that.
i
may
have
it
--
mr.
renea
hicks
i
believe
it
may
be
possible.
again,
i'm
not
argue
--
i'm
not
trying
to
argue
the
statute
--
mr.
renea
hicks
alright,
that's
correct.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct,
and
it
involved
the
penal
statute
but
it
did
involve
a
situation
where
there
had
been
an
accident
of
some
sort.
and
i
believe
in
under
--
although
the
issue
wasn't
presented
in
byers,
there
could
have
been
grounds
for
a
probable
stopping
situation.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct.
i
believe
that's
so.
if
at
the
scene
or
within
the
general
surroundings
of
the
murder
several
months
later
it
may
be
different.
mr.
renea
hicks
thank
you.
mr.
renea
hicks
your
honor,
i
wish
to
have
one
more
minute.
mr.
renea
hicks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
last
argument
that
i
would
like
to
address
or
the
last
issue
that
i
would
like
to
address
is
just
briefly
is
the
fifth
amendment
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
brief
on
appeal
by
mr.
brown's
attorney.
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
this
is
an
attack
on
the
statute
on
its
face
and
all
the
issues
that
are
not
in
particular
at
this
point
on
the
fifth
amendment
question.
and
the
fifth
amendment
self-privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
not
a
right
that
can
be
asserted
vicariously
on
behalf
of
large
groups
of
people.
this
court
has
many
times
held
that
is
a
personal
privilege
that
must
be
asserted
which
brings
me
to
my
second
point
on
this
and
that
is
that
mr.
brown
nowhere
in
the
proceedings
until
the
motion
to
dis
--
set
aside
the
information
was
filed
invoked
the
fifth
amendment.
in
fact,
on
the
way
down
to
the
booking
station
he
told
them
his
name.
another
point
i
would
like
to
make
use
under
california
versus
byers
at
least
in
a
plurality
opinion,
this
court
has
written
that
a
person's
name
and
his
address
is
just
a
neutral
adamant
information
which
is
not
incriminating
in
anyway
and
it
can
be
analogized
to
the
taking
of
blood
samples,
the
exhibition
of
the
person
at
a
lineup
in
such
situations.
one
question
that
has
not
come
up
here
so
far
and
was
brought
up
in
the
defillippo
case,
i
think
mr.
justice
white
asked
it,
was
--
what
about
the
miranda
situation?
but,
is
it
required
that
miranda
warnings
be
given?
i
didn't
want
to
point
out
that
miranda
spoke
briefly
to
this
issue
when
it
said
that
it
did
not
apply
to
general
on
the
scene
question
in
circumstances
where
a
crime
might
have
been
committed
or
something
like
that.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
that's
true,
this
particular
crime
was
not.
and
what
i
was
saying
is
as
going
back
to
my
argument
that
a
lawful
stop,
in
the
terry
versus
ohio
stop,
miranda
seem
to
side
that
in
a
situation
like
that
you
don't
need
to
give
miranda
warnings
because
general
on
the
scene
question
is
not
covered.
i
think
oregon
versus
methieson
kind
of
expanded
this
idea.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
that's
true.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
a
person
that's
reasonably
stopped
--
mr.
renea
hicks
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
renea
hicks
he
has
been
detained
in
the
fourth
amendment
i
agree.
and
--
mr.
renea
hicks
he
is
in
custody
when
he's
placed
under
arrest.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
renea
hicks
yes,
correct.
i
just
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
not
even
be
workable
in
such
a
situation.
mr.
renea
hicks
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
the
question.
mr.
renea
hicks
no,
he
is
not.
he
--
he
has
been
detained
but
whether
that
is
--
mr.
renea
hicks
the
person
is
in
--
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
again
i'm
relying
on
cases
like
the
rosco
and
miranda
and
the
situation
in
oregon
versus
mathieson
where
the
court
--
oregon
versus
mathieson
law
situation
where
a
person
was
under
suspicion
and
had
been
asked
to
voluntarily
come
down
to
the
police
station.
he
was
--
mr.
renea
hicks
correct,
but
he
was
in
a
policeman's
office
for
two
hours
or
so
locked
up
in
there.
mr.
renea
hicks
and
this
court
held
that
that
no
miranda
warnings
were
required.
mr.
renea
hicks
in
that
--
mr.
renea
hicks
i
--
i
think
there's
no
doubt
that
there's
some
element
of
involuntariness
in
it
that
the
person
is
detained.
and
that
the
whole
thrust
of
terry
was
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
involved
in
those
situations.
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
true.
mr.
renea
hicks
well,
that
--
that's
the
point
i
was
making
that
the
person
--
the
--
mr.
renea
hicks
that's
correct.
they
can
pat
him
down
or
frisk
him
to
see
if
he
has
a
gun
if
circumstances
are
present
which
indicate
that
they
may
need
to
protect
themselves.
mr.
renea
hicks
oh,
i'm
not
arguing
that
there
isn't
under
terry
in
situation
like
this
but
it
is
not
--
mr.
renea
hicks
i've
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
suggestion
that
it
would
be
applicable.
i
just
don't
see
how
it
would
be.
and
that's
all.
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you.
