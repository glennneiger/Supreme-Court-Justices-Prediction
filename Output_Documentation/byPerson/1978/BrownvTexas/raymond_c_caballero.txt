mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
don't
know
the
quorom
was.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
brown
versus
texas
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
county
court
at
law,
number
2
for
el
paso
county,
texas.
from
a
misdemeanor
conviction
for
the
failure
to
identify
himself
by
appellant
and
to
the
report
of
his
name
and
address.
the
facts
are
that
on
december
9,
1977
at
approximately
noon,
two
uniformed
el
paso
police
patrolman
in
the
squad
car
looked
down
an
alley
and
noticed
appellant
and
another
individual
who
were
apparently
only
a
couple
of
feet
apart
walking
in
opposite
directions.
the
officer
could
not
tell
if
the
individuals
had
met
or
had
spoken.
both
men
were
black.
no
other
activity
was
noticed.
there
was
no
report
of
suspicious
or
criminal
activity.
the
officer
stated
that
they
decided
to
stop
appellant
to
ask
him
his
name
and
that
that
was
the
sole
purpose
for
the
stop.
the
appellant
was
stopped
and
the
officers
did
ask
him
for
his
name
and
also
for
the
reason
for
his
presence
in
the
alley.
appellant
protested
the
stop
stating
that
the
officer
had
neither
right
nor
reason
to
detain
him.
he
did
not
resist
the
arrest
or
stop.
brown
was
padded
down
then
and
no
weapons,
drugs
or
any
of
the
contraband
were
found
on
his
person.
but
he
was
placed
under
arrest
for
the
failure
to
identify
himself.
the
other
individual
in
the
alley
was
never
stopped
or
questioned.
now
on
the
way
to
jail,
appellant
gave
the
officers
his
name
but
he
was
still
booked
for
the
offense
the
officers
stating
within
his
viewpoint
the
offense
was
complete
at
that
point.
he
was
later
on
found
guilty
in
an
on-jury
trial
and
was
fined
500
--
$45.00.
now,
the
provision
in
question
does
not
carry
any
term,
jail
term
or
imprisonment
simply
provides
for
a
maximum
penalty
of
a
$200.00
fine.
the
provision
is
section
3802
of
the
texas
penal
code
which
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
refuse
to
give
a
report
of
one's
name
and
address
to
a
peace
officer
who
has
lawfully
stopped
one
and
requested
that
information.
this
case
is
significant
and
different
from
defillippo
that
you've
just
heard
in
the
following
respects.
the
detroit
ordinance
at
least
attempts
to
put
in
some
sort
of
a
terry
standard
that
there
must
be
suspicious
conduct
or
criminal
conduct
afoot
which
would
allow
a
police
officer
to
investigate
further
and
ask
for
one's
name.
the
texas
statute
does
not
have
any
such
requirement.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
think
your
honor
that
if
you
use
the
word
lawful
in
a
statute
such
as
this,
you
can
i
suppose
read
in
all
kinds
of
standards.
however
to
the
person
reading
the
statute
on
its
phase
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
what
i'm
saying
is
simply
by
reading
unlawful,
there's
nothing
to
tell
you
whether
it
must
be
criminal
activity
for
example.
it
may
be
that
the
texas
legislature
thought
it
was
lawful
for
a
person,
police
officer
to
stop
a
person
on
walking
down
the
street
and
asking
for
his
name
for
no
other
reason.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i'm
suggesting
they
probably
didn't
consider
it
carefully
enough
your
honor.
the
statute
is
not
drafted
carefully
enough
to
set
forth
what
is
lawful
and
what
is
not
and
that
is
one
of
our
principal
arguments
here.
now,
also
in
the
defillippo
there
was
evidence
of
other
criminal
activity,
drunkenness,
perhaps
some
sort
of
indecency
or
sexual
conduct,
possession
of
drugs,
possibly
impersonation
of
a
police
sergeant.
in
this
case
here,
we're
solely
dealing
with
an
offense
involving
only
one
type
of
criminal
conduct
and
that
was
the
offense
of
failing
to
identify
himself.
now,
defillippo
did
not
involve
a
prosecution
for
failure
to
identify.
this
case
it
does
involve
that
kind
of
prosecution.
also,
in
defillippo,
of
course
it
was
a
question
of
good
faith
reliance
by
the
police
officer
on
the
ordinance.
before
the
trial
court
and
before
this
court,
the
appellant
has
challenged
its
unconstitu
--
the
constitutionality
of
the
texas
statute
for
facial
vagueness
and
for
overbreadth
because
it
punishes
not
innocent
conduct
your
honor
but
protected
conduct
and
there's
a
big
difference.
conduct
protected
by
the
first,
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution
making
the
statute
therefore
invalid
under
the
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
first
question
is
comes
up
into
the
vagueness
argument,
can
a
police
officer
ask
someone
questions.
this
is
apart
from
the
ability
to
stop
someone.
can
he
ask
someone
a
question?
point
brought
up
by
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
i
agree
with
it.
he
has
the
same
rights,
i
can
ask
people
questions.
i
think
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
it
is
correct.
he
has
the
same
rights
as
any
other
citizen
to
ask
questions.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
up
to
a
point
your
honor
where
it
becomes
harassment
or
where
you're
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
simply
that
point,
for
example,
if
i'm
arguing
the
case
up
here
and
the
police
officer
came
up
to
me
right
now
and
asked
me
what
is
my
name,
i
don't
know
if
that
would
be
a
reasonable
type
of
inquiry
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
conceivably
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that's
correct
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
conceivably
there
could
be
limitations
on
a
person's
right
to
ask
questions.
but
i
think
as
a
general
proposition
under
most
fact
situations
he
does
have
a
right
to
ask
questions.
now,
what
about
the
stop?
the
way
i
read
davis
versus
mississippi,
the
fourth
amendment
is
applicable
to
any
kind
of
stops,
detentions,
arrest,
they're
all
the
same
as
i
understand
the
reading
of
davis
versus
mississippi.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
believe
it
did
your
honor.
in
that
case
i
can
explain
terry
versus
ohio,
judge
--
your
honor.
the
only
way
i
can
see
it
is
that
under
terry,
you're
simply
trying
to
protect
the
life
of
a
police
officer
who
--
thinking
there
is
criminal
activity
afoot,
number
one
and
two
thinking
that
he
might
be
in
a
dangerous
position
is
simply
able
to
pat
someone
down
before
he
starts
asking
the
questions.
let's
move
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
your
honor
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
that's
the
problem
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--
with
this
case,
it
is
not
limited
to
civil
or
criminal
incidents.
and
what
i
suggested
to
the
court
in
my
brief
was
that
texas
used
to
have
a
predecessor
statute
which
was
not
a
penal
statute,
kind
of
a
material
witness
type
statute
provided
that
the
police
officer
could
round
up
the
witnesses
to
a
civil
or
a
criminal
incident
which
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
your
honor,
the
statutes
that
i'm
talking
about
does
not
make
you
identify
yourself.
you
have
a
choice
of
doing
two
things.
first,
you
can
identify
yourself
or
if
you
stand
mute
and
refuse
to
identify
yourself,
then
the
officer
must
take
before
a
neutral
magistrate
at
that
time
make
a
provision
for
a
material
witness
bond
or
to
identify
yourself.
but
no
statute
--
i'm
not
suggesting
to
this
court
that
any
statute,
civil
or
criminal
can
make
you
under
the
pain
of
criminal
violation
state
what
your
name
is
or
say
anything.
anything
that
comes
from
your
mouth
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
your
honor
is
a
violation
of
both
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
if
its
orally
compelled.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
then
he
places
you
under
material
witness
bond.
if
you
can't
make
a
bond
then
you're
in
jail
your
honor.
now,
i
am
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
let
me
talk
about
the
first
amendment
then
your
honor.
let's
assume
that
you
have
a
fact
situation
of
nwacp
v.
alabama
that
is
the
situation
where
you
have
the
group
persons
who
for
their
own
protection
are
trying
to
unite
and
let's
say
get
rid
of
racial
segregation
which
was
the
case
there.
and
the
state
wasn't
violently
opposed
to
--
at
that
point
that
leads
to
the
nwacp.
and
you
want
to
find
out
as
a
state
officer
who
the
members
are
of
the
nwacp.
now,
this
court
held
under
nwacp
v.
alabama
that
you
could
--
a
court
could
not
compel
nwacp
to
give
up
its
membership
lists.
i'm
suggesting
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
violation
potentially
here
if
i
could
stop
every
single
person
who
had
attended
an
nwacp
meeting
on
their
way
out
of
the
meeting
and
ask
them,
"what
is
your
name?"
a
person
refuses
to
give
his
name
then
i'm
marching
him
on
down
to
jail,
have
him
fingerprinted
and
try
to
ascertain
your
identification
through
some
other
means.
i
am
suggesting
your
honor
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
violation.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
in
nwacp?
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
they
spoke
more
broadly
than
that
your
honor.
i
believe
they
said
that
privacy
in
one's
associations
are
involved
in
the
freedom
of
the
association
that
in
some
instances
your
freedom
to
associate
if
endangered
if
the
privacy
is
not
there,
the
arraigning
student
type
thing
or
the
--
your
ability
to
redress
and
to
protest
anonymously
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
no,
your
honor.
i
think
my
client's
activity
is
closer
and
still
first
amendment
protected
right
which
this
court
decided
in
norwell
versus
cincinnati
wherein
a
police
officer
approached
a
gentleman
walking
under
--
with
a
suspicious
person
activity
--
report
afoot
and
he
stopped
to
mr.
norwell
and
he
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
there
at
that
time
of
the
night
and
mr.
norwell
simply
said,
"i
don't
tell
you
anything",
in
those
words.
and
this
court
held
out
it
was
protected
activity
at
a
non-provocative
protest
of
an
arrest.
and
i
think
my
case
is
closer
to
that
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
believe
you
just
said
it
was
protected
activity.
i
can
only
assume
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
he
did
say
something
your
honor
and
he
did
pretty
much
the
same
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
they
didn't
--
he
was
arrested
for
what
he
did
not
say.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
but
he
did
say
something
and
that
was
that
he
protested
the
right
and
reason
of
the
officers
to
detain
him
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case.
by
implication,
if
you
say
to
take
the
question
earlier
what
lawfully
means,
by
implication
if
i
only
have
to
give
my
name
under
the
texas
statute
when
i'm
lawfully
stopped
it
would
mean
that
if
i
am
not
lawfully
stopped
then
i
don't
have
to
give
my
name.
now
when
in
--
is
one
person
supposed
to
know
that
he
is
not
lawfully
stopped
under
the
city
civil
case,
under
terry,
under
davis
versus
mississippi,
a
person
--
let's
assume
you
had
a
constitutional
scholar
walking
down
the
street
and
he
knew
about
those
cases
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
you're
not
--
you
don't
--
you're
simply
arrested,
that's
a
fact.
but
in
this
case,
apparently
a
person
has
an
option
at
least
for
a
little
while
to
think,
"is
this
a
lawful
arrest
or
is
it
not?"
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
alright
sir.
then
you're
getting
into
a
different
area
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
no,
i
don't
think
you
can
your
honor
because
he's
still
protected
activity.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
no.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
no,
your
honor.
that's
getting
out
of
the
vagueness
and
--
then
you're
getting
into
the
area
of
overbreadth
because
at
that
point
what
you're
doing
is
you're
making
criminal
conduct
which
is
protected
by
the
first,
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
not
because
of
vagueness.
you're
setting
aside
the
vagueness
argument
at
that
point.
now,
the
california
statute,
the
detroit
ordinance
in
this
case,
the
henderson
city
ordinance
all
kind
of
incorporate
a
little
bit
better
than
this
statute
does,
the
terry
type
criteria.
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing,
i
don't
think
you
can
read
anything
near
terry
into
the
words
lawfully
in
this
case.
also,
what
is
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
by
following
the
motions
to
suppressed,
i
did
not.
i
challenged
the
statute
on
its
face
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
think
that
my
client's
activity,
let's
say
in
this
case
if
they
did
have
probable
cost
to
stop
my
client,
i
could
still
challenge
the
statute.
i
don't
think
you
can
assume
lawfulness
in
this
case.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
may
conceivably
be
cases
where
it
would
not
be
a
lawful
stop.
this
may
or
may
not
be
a
lawful
stop.
i'm
not
conceding
and
it
did
not
at
the
trial
court
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
did
your
honor.
i
state
--
at
page
25
--
page
18
of
the
record,
if
the
purpose
of
the
stop
was
i
want
to
ask
this
fellow's
name
then
of
course
i
would
contend
that's
--that
that's
not
a
lawful
purpose.
that's
in
the
middle
of
page
18
of
the
record.
i
have
never
conceded
that
this
stop
was
lawful.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that's
great,
that
point
i
didn't
know
your
honor.
i
already
had
--
heard
the
evidence
and
that
was
before
the
trial.
but
i
have
never
can
assume
--
assumed
or
conceded
that
this
was
a
lawful
stop
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
your
honor,
i
have
all
--
no
i
did
not.
i
have
always
argued
that
the
statute
on
its
face
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
no,
i
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
the
reason
i
have
attacked
it
on
its
face
your
honor,
i
can
see
--
i
can
--
eye
to
eye,
my
position
before
this
court,
this
is
the
same
kind
of
case
as
see
versus
seattle
and
camara
versus
municipal
court
of
san
francisco
and
that
is
in
those
cases
they're
attempting
to
make
criminal
a
person's
implication
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
no
motion
is
suppressed,
no
nothing,
simply
an
attack
on
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
have
a
motion
to
suppress
in
order
to
raise
facial
invalidity
on
fourth
amendment
grounds.
and
you
did
not
have
to
have
it
as
see
versus
seattle
or
camara
versus
municipal
court.
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
no,
your
honor.
not
if
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
--
you're
looking
at
the
state
statute
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
this
case
here
may
have
been
a
valid
stop,
may
--
you
can
assume
that
it
was.
that's
correct
your
honor.
for
my
purposes
i'm
arguing
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
you
would
have
to
assume
that
but
for
purposes
of
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
for
purpose
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
my
understanding
of
the
term
vagueness
mr.
justice
stevens
is
a
person
reading
the
statute
would
be
able
to
tell
whether
his
conduct
was
criminal
or
not.
i
thought
that
was
a
test
of
vagueness
not
whether
the
court
somewhere
knew
what
terry
versus
ohio
held.
but
maybe
i
misunderstood
it.
that's
what
i
thought
vagueness
meant.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
in
this
case,
if
you
were
to
--
if
i
were
to
--
had
said
my
conducts
--
the
conduct
of
my
client
in
this
case
was
protected,
it
was
not
criminal,
that
would
be
correct
your
honor.
but
if
you
are
raising
facial
invalidity
and
vagueness,
i
would
say
no
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
constitutional
issue
or
you
can
simply,
the
court
below
could
have
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal
and
i
suppose
this
court
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
then
that's
the
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i'm
not
to
be
just--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
your
honor,
the
constitutional
grounds
would
be
basically
fourteenth
from
the
due
process
which
would
also
bring
in
the
first,
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
not
reach
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
i
was
simply
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes,
your
honor.
on
its
--
as
applied
and
also
on
its
face.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
no,
your
honor.
this
question
came
up
earlier
and
i
can
answer
your
question
i
believe
in
this
manner.
if
the
statute
provides
a
pretext
for
an
arrest
such
as
for
example
in
defillippo,
you
find
drugs
or
other
violations,
you
never
see
this
kind
of
prosecution
arise.
it's
a
very
rare
instance
i
don't
even
know
how
we
got
this
far
but
usually
at
that
point
prosecutors
have
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
your
honor
i
was
only
just
defending
my
client.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
at
that
point,
the
prosecutors
are
simply
not
interested
in
prosecuting
someone
for
the
mere
refusal
to
give
his
name.
and
you
don't
see
this
kind
of
prosecution.
no
texas
appellate
court
to
my
knowledge
and
i've
checked
has
ever
considered
the
issue.
in
sunny
shell
versus
texas
that
i
have
cited
in
my
reply
brief
they
didn't
cite
the
statute
but
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
give
you
its
viewpoint
concerning
the
lawfulness
of
stopping
someone
on
the
street
and
asking
their
name
and
i
was
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
he
gave
that
explanation
your
honor.
i
don't
see
that
anyone's
fourth
amendment
rights
are
diminished
in
any
respect
because
he
happens
to
be
walking
through
a
so-called
high
drug
area.
i
don't
think
he
alludes
any
of
your
fourth
amendment
rights
because
he
happened
to
be
walking
through
such
an
area.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
that's
--
that
was
his
submission
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
if
that
were
the
case
though
your
honor,
i
would
imagine
that
he
wanted
to
stop
the
other
party
to
the
drug
transaction
and
also
ask
him
a
question
or
two
which
they
never
did.
i
guess
they
assumed
that
the
drugs
were
flowing
from
my
client
to
the
other
which
in
the
case
--
if
they
really
did
believe
that
they
wanted
to
make
a
drug
arrest
they
would
certainly
stop
both
parties,
if
they
thought
my
client
sold
then
the
second
party
would
have
them.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
the
only
thing
in
the
record
was,
he
was
never
stopped
or
questioned
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes,
sir.
reading
terry
into
the
words
lawfully
stopped
looking
through
the
record
there
i
don't
know
that
the
court
below
ever
considered
terry.
and
i
can't
see
simply
by
saying
a
state
legislature
putting
in
the
words
lawful
or
unlawful
reads
in
or
reads
out
supreme
court
decisions.
and
under
the
decision
in
this
court,
connally
versus
general
construction
company,
the
terms
of
a
penal
statute
creating
a
new
offense
must
be
sufficiently
explicit
to
inform
those
who
are
subject
to
it.
that's
the
test
of
vagueness
not
that
some
court
some
place
may
be
able
to
read
in
terry
or
read
it
out
in
a
particular
situation.
otherwise,
all
you
have
to
do
to
make
a
statute
pass
the
vagueness
test
here
would
be
just
to
put
in
the
words
lawfully
stopped
or
unlawful
detention
or
whatever
you
may
want
to
read
into
the
statute
by
those
words.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
agree
with
you
sir.
in
the
situation
where
you
read
in
the
words
lawful
there
are
other
standards
for
example
unlawfully
on
the
premises
normally
takes
to
me
you're
on
the
premises
and
you
don't
have
permission
to
be
there.
but
the
words
lawfully
stopped
are
so
vague
it's
a
question
of
degree
i
agree
with
you.
that
they
are
so
vague
lawfully
stopped
that
in
this
case
for
example
this
court
under
facts
that
i
would
consider
that
it
was
not
a
lawful
stop
simply
stopping
the
person
in
an
alley
who
had
not
been
doing
anything
wrong,
no
suspicion
or
report
that
he
had
been
doing
anything
wrong.
court
held
below
that
it
was
a
lawful
stop.
now
what
the
court
did
below,
the
court
had
serious
reservations
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
but
simply
presumed
that
the
statute
was
valid
and
read
in
to
the
statute
apparently
that
this
was
also
a
valid
stop
as
applied
in
this
particular
case.
now
if
the
stop
had
been
unlawful,
necessarily
my
client
would've
been
acquitted
and
you
would
not
be
reviewing
the
statute.
if
the
stop
is
lawful,
excuse
me,
if
the
stop
was
unlawful
under
the
facts
of
the
case
then
it
would
be
like
norwell
where
you
simply
apply
in
the
--
there
was
protected
activity,
it
never
reached
the
constitutional
issue
by
that
means.
and
incidentally
in
norwell
versus
cincinnati,
i
went
back
and
looked
at
it,
you
--
this
court
did
say
we
are
persuaded
at
the
ordinance
as
applied
to
this
petitioner
on
the
facts
of
this
case
operated
to
punish
his
constitutionally
protected
speech.
so
that
was
decided
on
first
amendment
grounds.
the
fifth
amendment
question
in
this
case,
it's
very
difficult
sometimes
to
see
how
the
invocation
of
that
right
to
--
under
the
fifth
amendment
can
be
valid
or
it
applies
to
a
name
only.
however,
in
the
situation
where
for
example
i
saw
a
case
out
of
texas,
the
miller
case
cited
on
the
brief
where
a
person
had
made
a
false
claim
for
insurance.
he
claimed
that
he
was
dead,
the
claim
was
made
through
his
wife.
later
on
he
was
arrested.
had
he
given
his
name
joe
dolks
or
anything
else,
that
person
had
never
would've
put
the
crime
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
isn't
that
also
incrimination?
incrimination
goes
beyond
mere
evidence
presented
in
court.
incrimination
means
something
that
they
may
subject
me
to
prosecution.
and
i
can't
see
how
you
can
totally
separate
the
concepts
of
evidence
in
court
and
probable
cause
also
evidence
to
give
someone
a
reasonable
cause
to
arrest
him
--
a
person.
i
--
separating
the
two,
i
have
a
difficult
time
with
that.
to
me
they're
both
incrimination.
one
allows
evidence
to
be
presented
in
court.
the
other
one
allows
my
arrest.
in
either
case
it's
incrimination.
but
reaching
the
cons
--
how
would
you
ever
--
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
how
would
you
ever
test
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
if
you
didn't
get
beyond
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
find
out
whether
there
was
constitutionally
protected
conduct
which
was
being
punished
by
the
statute
here
which
is
exactly
what
appellant
is
trying
to
do.
and
is
there
constitutionally
protected
conduct
which
this
--
the
statute
in
this
case
makes
criminal.
the
fact
is
you
do
have
a
right
to
walk
down
the
street
and
stand
mute.
under
the
case
norwell
versus
cincinnati,
you
do
have
the
right
to
walk
down
the
street
and
tell
the
policeman
i
don't
want
to
tell
you
anything.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
my
client
said
he
protested
the
reason
and
the
right
of
the
officers
to
stop
him.
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
alright.
yeah,
under
norwell,
whether
norwell
was
being
prosecuted
for
saying
something
or
not
doing
something,
the
point
is
that
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
it
was
constitutionally
protected
speech.
in
other
words,
telling
the
police
officer
i
don't
want
to
tell
you
anything,
this
court
held
was
constitutionally
protected
speech.
if
someone
is
asking
my
name
and
i
tell
them,
"i
don't
want
to
tell
you
anything"
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
alright,
then
you
get
closer
to
the
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
the
first
amendment
claim
i
see
is
a
very
real
problem
not
so
--
aside
from
the
norwell
case,
the
case
of
a
person
who
wishes
anonymously
to
protest
goes
to
a
meeting
but
doesn't
want
anyone
to
know
that
he
is
there.
i
think
it
is
a
very
real
problem
under
the
first
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
i
think
it
ought
to
be
pinned
on
the
first,
fourth,
and
fifth.
your
honor,
they
all
are
bundled
so
close
together
that
i
don't
think
any
one
amendment
ought
to
decide
this
case.
i
think
this
is
a
group
of
rights
that
are
so
close
in
this
case
--
mr.
raymond
c.
caballero
well,
it
may
be
a
shotgun
approach
but
i
legitimately
believe
that
the
first,
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
all
protect
the
conduct
in
this
case.
thank
you
your
honor.
