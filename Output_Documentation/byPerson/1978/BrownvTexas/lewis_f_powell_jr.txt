justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
come
back
to
the
question
you've
just
been
discussing?
one
of
the
elements
on
this
statute
is
that
the
stop
must
be
lawful.
now
that's
what
the
statute
says.
i
realize
you
argued
that
lawful
could
mean
a
lot
of
things.
but
it
seems
to
me
from
the
record
that
that
element
of
the
offense
maybe
absent
in
this
case,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
mr.
paton
on
page
15
of
the
appendix
concedes
that
the
stop
must
be
lawful.
he
said
an
officer
cannot
go
up
to
anyone
on
the
street
and
ask
his
name
unless
the
stop
is
lawful.
and
if
you
look
at
what
the
officer
said
back
on
page
28
and
later
at
31,
i
think
the
response
to
your
questions
at
the
bottom
of
page
28,
you
inquire,
did
you
--
was
any
action
by
my
client
that
he
was
armed
or
committed
a
crime
at
that
time,
the
answer
was
no.
the
only
thing
you
wanted
to
do
was
to
stop
him
and
ask
him
for
his
name.
and
the
answer
was
correct.
so
doesn't
that
why
should
the
element
of
a
lawful
stop
better
this
case
altogether?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that
perhaps
but
why
do
you
have
to
get
to
the
constitutional
issue
if
an
element
of
the
statutory
offense
is
by
concession
absent?
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
i
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
counsel,
i
take
it
then
you're
suggesting
that
we
should
judge
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
validity
of
the
statute
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
permits
an
officer
to
stop
any
person
at
any
time
regardless
of
the
circumstances
and
ask
his
name
and
if
the
person
refuses
to
arrest
him.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
asking
though,
i'll
ask
you
then,
is
it
a
lawful
stop
to
just
stop
any
person
indiscriminately
and
ask
the
name?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
help
you
out.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
if
you
assume
they
knew
what
the
law
was,
do
you
--
you
would
think
it
was
at
least
a
terry
stop,
is
that
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
he
did
more
than
that.
he
verbally
and
negatively
protested.
now
in
your
case,
you
don't
have
anything
said
at
all.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
he's
being
arrested
for
not
speaking
to
with
--
identifying
himself.
i
think
it's
a
very
different
case
from
norwell.
i
think
your
first
amendment
argument
is
frivolous.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
of
course
it
protects
speech,
that's
the
first
amendment.
the
question
here
is
there
is
a
lack
of
speech.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
you
have
much
stronger
arguments
on
other
amendments
than
you
do
on
the
first
amendment
and
i
think
you're
spinning
your
wheels
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
want
to
pin
your
case
in
the
first
amendment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
maybe
one
of
the
troubles
of
the
case
you
have
a
shotgun
approach
you,
then
everything
possible.
