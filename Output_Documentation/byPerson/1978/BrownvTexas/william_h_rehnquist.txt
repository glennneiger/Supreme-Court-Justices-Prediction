justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
that
decided
at
least
in
part,
to
--
on
the
theory,
the
freedom
to
assemble
and
petition
for
redress
of
grievances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here,
your
client
i
take
it
wasn't
engaged
in
any
comparable
activity
to
that
--
in
nwacp
versus
alabama.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
on
its
face
mr.
caballero
i
know
--
in
your
index
of
authority,
its
in
front
of
your
brief,
the
only
texas
case
you
cite
is
one
saying
that
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
jurisdiction
only
where
the
fine
level
is
over
$100.00
and
it
very
likely
is
not
your
fault
that
you
can't
get
to
a
higher
texas
appellate
court.
have
there
--
but
have
there
been
any
texas
appellate
decisions
construing
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
unless
you
get
a
fine
of
over
$100.00
you
will
never
get
a
case
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
under
this
case
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
the
state
of
texas
passed
a
statute
saying
that
every
citizen
when
he
left
home
during
the
day
had
to
call
the
local
police
station,
tell
them
he
was
leaving
and
where
he
was
going
or
when
he'd
be
back
and
made
a
vio
--
made
a
pros
--
a
violation
of
that
command
or
criminal
offense
punishable
by
a
fine?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
general
due
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
el
paso
county
court
says
lawfully
stopped
under
the
statute
means
lawful
for
purposes
of
federal
constitutional
laws
as
well
as
texas
law
and
i
conclude
this
was
a
valid
terry
stop.
and
this
court
which
is
hearing
the
case
now
says,
"no.
we
do
not
think
it
was
a
voluntary
stop."
we
would
--
we'd
simply
reverse
on
it
as
applied
basis,
wouldn't
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
difficulty
with
your
case
is
that
we
don't
have
an
opinion
from
the
texas
court
and
so
we
don't
know
whether
it's
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
state
statute
that
maybe
troublesome
constitutionally
or
whether
it's
an
evaluation
of
the
evidence
under
a
perfectly
permissible
interpretation
of
the
state
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
many
statutes
in
fact
do
that,
for
instance,
criminal
test
which
statutes
doesn't
--
oh,
unlawfully
on
the
premises
and
--
it
may
be
a
question
of
considerable
doubt
in
that
particular
case
whether
a
person
is
or
is
not
lawfully
on
the
premises.
