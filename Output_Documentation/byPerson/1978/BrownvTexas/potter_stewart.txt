justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
a
yes.
he
can
ask,
can
he?
justice
potter
stewart
it
takes
--
the
police
officer
can.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
least
those
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
but
to
inquire
what
is
your
name?
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
brown
wasn't
arguing
a
case
here,
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
terry
against
ohio
said
the
same
thing,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
court
in
this
case
held
that
this
was
a
lawful
stop.
it
had
to
hold
so
in
order
to
convict
this
person.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
that's
the
way
we
have
to
read
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
highest
court
in
which
we
have
any
construction
of
this
texas
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
and
whereas
my
brother
rehnquist
suggest
we're
not
likely
to
get
it
from
any
higher
court.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
possible,
we
haven't
yet.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
the
sole
construction
of
the
statute
we
have
that
the
stop
by
this
policeman
of
this
petitioner
was
a
lawful
stop
or
else
there
couldn't
have
been
a
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
indication
in
this
case
that
it
does.
none,
in
fact
all
the
indications
are
on
the
other
way,
the
very
fact
that
this
person
was
convicted
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you
have
no
basis
for
submitting
that
this
law
requires
at
least
in
--
a
justification
equivalent
to
the
terry
against
ohio
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
--
no
basis
on
this
case
for
saying
so?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
terry
versus
ohio
in
that
case
the
court
upheld
what
the
police
officer
did.
there
was
no
statute
ordinance
covering
what
he
did.
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
say
that
he
couldn't
have
done
more
or
less,
it
just
simply
upheld
what
he
did.
why
--
why
are
you
suggesting
that
that's
a
limit
of
what
a
police
officer
can
ever
do?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
just
did.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
telling
us
that
terry
against
ohio
represents
the
limit
of
what
a
lawful
stop
would
be,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
norwell
against
cincinnati?
justice
potter
stewart
cincinnati,
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
this
statute
makes
it
an
obligation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
contrary
i
think
--
what
i
understood
you
to
answer
a
few
minutes
ago
that
you
didn't
think
a
state
could
validly
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
misunderstood
you
then.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
telling
us
that
this
statute
doesn't
go
that
far.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
crime
wasn't
committed
until
after
the
question
was
asked?
