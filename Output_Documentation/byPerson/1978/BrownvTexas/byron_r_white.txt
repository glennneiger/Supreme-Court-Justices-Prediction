justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it
has
the
word
awful.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
you
assume
that
the
texas
courts
understood
what
a
lawful
stop
was
and
convicted
this
person,
you
would
have
thought
that
that
as
a
initial
matter,
they
thought
to
stop
was
a
lawful
and
that
therefore
there
was
at
least
a
voluntary
stop.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that's
a
vagueness
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
vague
--
you're
making
a
vagueness
argument
but
you
were
just
making
a
statement
that
the
texas
statute
didn't
have
any
standard
in
a
--
different
from
the
michigan
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
you
--
you
do
are
suggesting
that
neither
the
texas
legislature
nor
the
texas
courts
knew
what
lawful
meant?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
when
is
--
somebody
is
supposed
to
know
when
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you.
what
if
the
--
what
if
there's
a
probable
cause
--
what
if
a
policeman
thinks
there's
probable
cost
to
arrest
and
then
he
arrests
him
then
he
--
and
he
ask
him
his
name?
do
you
think
the
state
could
then
make
the
refusal
to
give
the
name
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
will
be
vague?
because
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
will
be
vague?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
we
have
to
have
some
constitutional
basis
for
setting
aside
the
state
conviction.
i
don't
care
what
kind
of
--
i
do
care
what
the
ground
might
be
but
there
has
to
be
some
constitutional
ground
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
are
you
suggesting
that
there
wouldn't
--
that
it
was
without
any
evidence
and
whatsoever,
is
that
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
to
be
a
fourth
amendment
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i'm
--
i
take
it
that
whatever
level
of
suspicion
there
might
have
been
in
this
case,
in
the
state
courts
have
apparently
said
it
under
the
statute
it's
enough
and
so
that
poses
at
least
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
have
been
--
mr.
caballero,
it's
because
you
brought
it
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
even
have
nothing.
that
wouldn't
be
the
necessary,
the
ground
that
it
would
just
be
that
the
evidence
isn't
enough
to
justify
a
terry
stop.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think
--
you
say
that
issue
wasn't
presented
in
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
assumed
that
--
if
he
assumed
the
reason
then
one
of
the
constitutionality
passed
on
he
didn't
present
the
lawfulness
of
the
stop.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
--
are
you
conceding
that,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
not
contending
here
then
that
they
--
that
you
can
make
a
crime
up
to
--
as
to
that
a
state
could
make
it
a
crime
to
refuse
to
give
your
name
whenever
you're
stopped
for
whatever
reason
or
no
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know.
yes,
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
would've
been
plenty
of
evidence
to
support
a
conviction
refusing
to
give
your
name
if
he
refused
to
give
his
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
wouldn't
be
any
evidence
of
a
lawful
stop.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there's
a
reasonable
suspiciousness
doctrine.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
happen
to
think
the
issue
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
stop
was
properly
here
in
the
sense
was
there
a
terry
grounds
for
stopping?
if
that
issue
is
here
and
we
decided
there
were
not
sufficient
grounds
to
make
a
terry
stop
then
before
we
could
reverse
we
would
have
to
say
that
the
state
may
not
make
a
person
identify
himself
unless
on
terry
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
there's
a
--
it's
probably
unlawful
in
texas
for
an
eyewitness
to
a
murder
to
refuse
to
identify
himself,
i
suppose.
