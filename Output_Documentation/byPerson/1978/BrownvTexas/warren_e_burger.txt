chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
brown
against
texas.
we'll
wait
just
a
moment
mr.
caballero.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
need
six
to
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
caballero,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
--
for
hypothetical
purposes,
out
of
the
criminal
area
and
say
that
a
police
car
called
to
an
automobile
collision
and
there
are
a
number
of
people
around.
do
you
suggest
that
the
state
has
no
police
power
to
require
the
persons
who
observed
that
automobile
collision
to
give
their
names
to
the
police
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
just
to
take
one
step
at
a
time,
the
first
amendment
is
no
barrier
to
a
statute
requiring
a
person
to
identify
himself
to
a
police
officer
at
high
noon
with
no
criminal
activity
going
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
if
you
refuse
to
do
that
before
the
magistrate
in
this
hypothetical
situation
then
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
pretty
well
washes
out
the
first
amendment
arguments
you're
making.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
was
arrested
for
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
he
arrested
for
what
he
did
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
that's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
fact
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
go
on
and
say
i
am
assuming
the
state
here
through
its
police
officers
had
some
reason
to
make
an
initial
stop.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
somewhere
in
your
observations
you
said
that
the
police
officer
gave
no
explanation
except
that
he
wanted
his
name.
i
--
i
suggest
that
isn't
quite
accurate.
the
police
officer
has
said
that
at
page
29,
just
above
the
middle,
he
referred
to
this
being
a
high
drug
area
and
it
is
--
this
is
certainly
related
to
the
reason
he
made
the
stop.
that's
a
part
of
the
officer's
explanation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
going
to
a
legal
argument
which
is
your
privilege.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
the
officer
did
give
a
reason.
the
reason
was
that
he
was
being
more
observant
in
a
high
drug
area
when
two
people
come
together
in
an
alley
obviously
because
they
might
be
engaged
in
a
drug
transaction.
they
might
not
be
but
that's
his
--
there
is
a
reason
given
by
the
officer
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
(voice
overlap)
of
frivolous
or
whimsical
idea.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
evidence
what
happened
to
other
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
caballero.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hicks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
pursue
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
hypothetical,
under
this
kind
of
an
ordinance
the
really
only
safe
way
that
is
--
this
can
avoid
embarrassment
at
least
is
to
carry
some
form
of
identification
on
him
at
all
times,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
view
that
the
texas
courts
concluded
that
there
was
a
lawful
stop
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
otherwise
he
couldn't
have
convicted,
could
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
it's
certainly
a
hornbook
that
the
whole
record
is
viewed
by
that
judge,
necessarily
by
us
but
by
that
--
the
judge
reaching
that
conclusion.
part
of
that
record
is
that
this
somewhat
inarticulate
policeman
and
brand
new
policemen
as
well
said
that
part
of
his
motivation
--
implied
the
part
of
his
motivation
was
that
it
was
in
a
high
drug
area.
is
it
reasonable
to
conclude,
do
you
think
we
could
conclude
that
the
judge
made
the
decision
that
the
lawfulness
was
demonstrated
in
relation
to
the
high
drug
area
that
the
policeman
said
was
part
of
his
reason?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
--
then
is
that
decision
reviewable
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
there
were
no
reference
by
the
policeman
in
this
record
to
the
fact
that
he
was
observing
two
men
in
an
alley,
in
a
high
drug
area
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
except
that
he
just
wanted
to
find
out
the
man's
name.
would
you
think
that
would
be
a
lawful
stop
or
a
permissible
stop
under
this
statute,
permissible
first
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
--
did
say
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
presuppposes
--
that
presupposes
that
there
is
a
valid
obligation
to
answer
the
question,
"what
is
your
name
and
identify
yourself?"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
byers
against
california
of
course
did
require
a
man
to
identify
himself
but
that
was
in
relation
to
the
driving
of
an
automobile,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
at
1
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
completed
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
very
well,
you
may
resume
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you're
certainly
restrained
if
someone
is
searching
you
for
weapons.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
the
genesis
of
the
voluntary
concept
that
it's
part
of
an
investigation
for
a
possible
criminal
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
isn't
just
to
see
whether
the
man
has
got
a
gun.
the
primary
trust
is
to
investigate
possible
criminal
activity
but
in
that
process
this
court
has
said,
they
may
search
the
person
to
see
whether
he
has
got
a
gun
and
that's
a
prophylactic
thing
so
that
the
officer
doesn't
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
there
is
a
--
there
is
an
element
of
detention
very
clearly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
has
never
been
thought
in
the
--
it
has
never
been
suggested
in
any
opinion
that
that
detention
or
custody
whatever
it
may
be
figures
the
miranda
warning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
caballero
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
aren't
you
confusing
probable
cause
with
incriminating?
the
disclosure
of
the
name
may
lead
to
the
arrest
but
the
disclosure
of
the
name
per
se
doesn't
incriminate
him?
it
merely
sets
in
motion
the
chain
of
events
that
will
bring
him
on
to
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
