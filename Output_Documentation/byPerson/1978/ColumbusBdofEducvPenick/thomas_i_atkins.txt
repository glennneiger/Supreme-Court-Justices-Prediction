mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
simply
stating
what
the
respondents
seek
from
this
court.
we
ask
that
this
court
sustain
the
finding
made
by
the
district
court
below
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
indeed
under
the
controlling
legal
principles
here
before
announced,
a
dual
system
existed
in
columbus
at
the
time
of
the
brown
decision
from
this
court.
and
that
the
existence
of
that
dual
system
imposed
an
affirmative
duty
under
green
and
we
ask
this
court
on
its
review
of
the
record
as
the
district
court
below
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
to
find
default
by
the
local
officials
in
carrying
that
affirmative
responsibility
a
failure
to
dismantle
the
dual
system.
we
ask
this
court
to
reject
the
petitioners'
preposition
that
you
can
treat
a
system-wide
cancer
such
as
segregation
with
a
band
aid.
and
instead
to
remain
true
to
its
holdings
in
brown,
in
green,
in
swann,
in
keyes,
in
milliken,
and
we
believe
in
dayton
that
where
a
system-wide
violation
has
been
shown
to
exist.
only
a
system-wide
remedy
is
capable
of
correcting
the
condition
that
offends
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
read
page
58
of
the
district
court's
opinion
to
be
simply
another
way
of
saying
what
this
court
said
in
swann
in
addressing
the
question
of
the
permissible
scope
of
transportation
as
the
remedial
implement.
and
it
said
we
cannot
precisely
define
for
every
case
how
much
will
be
permissible.
it
is
not
possible
to
do.
the
district
court
after
sitting
through
a
trial
with
70
witnesses
over
700
exhibits
and
nearly
7,000
pages
of
transcript
said,
“what
i
have
seen
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record
before
me
is
segregative
intent
specifically
carried
out
through
active
--
actions
of
the
public
officials
with
an
impact
which
is
system-wide
in
scope.”
here,
he
speaks
specifically
to
the
interaction
between
the
school
segregation
these
petitioners
caused
and
the
housing
segregation
in
the
neighborhoods
around
the
schools.
he
says
here,
as
he
does
in
other
points
throughout
his
opinion,
“far
from
the
schools
being
segregated,
because
the
neighborhoods
were
segregated,
the
neighborhoods
are
in
part
segregated
because
they
segregated
the
schools.”
i
don't
find
any
inconsistency
here.
and
in
this
court's
teaching
in
dayton
where
it
calls
for
the
most
careful
kind
of
scrutiny
of
the
violations
being
urged
upon
the
district
court
by
whoever
comes
to
it
seeking
relief.
we
believe
and
we
think
the
record
shows
that
the
district
court
was
very,
very
careful
in
evaluating
that
record.
it
fully
credit
it.
the
evidence
offered
by
the
defendants,
it
examined
it
carefully.
it
made
in
many
instances,
as
they
have
cited
statements
about
that
evidence.
it
found
by
the
clear
convincing
weight
of
all
of
the
evidence
before
it,
including
their
evidence,
that
there
was
system-wide
segregation
and
that
the
segregation
was
not
adventitious.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
i
think
the
court
recognized,
as
this
court
did
in
keyes,
that
state
action
can
take
place
either
by
the
passage
of
a
law
in
a
legislature
or
by
the
action
of
a
school
official
imbued
with
the
power
of
the
state
constitution
and
legislature.
it
found
in
this
case
as
in
keyes,
that
the
state
action
which
offended
the
constitution
were
the
specific
policies
which
pre-1954
created
the
five
black
schools
overnight
in
several
instances
which
had
a
specific
policy
of
assigning
all
the
black
faculty
only
to
the
black
schools
which
as
my
brother
counsel
fails
to
point
out
to
the
court.
when
this
court
found
construction
violations
that
created
a
black
school,
it
was
also
a
finding
as
this
court
has
noted,
a
reciprocal
effect
necessarily
upon
the
white
schools
whose
boundaries
were
changed
to
accommodate
the
warehouse
being
built
for
black
students.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
respondents
are
not
so
arguing
because
we
think
that
is
not
common
sense.
we
think
that
a
--
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
--
finding
of
a
single
violation
with
a
single
school
even
taking
into
account
whatever
reciprocal
effects
there
might
have
been
would
certainly
not
justify
a
system-wide
remedy
and
we
are
not
arguing
that
here.
that's
not
the
facts
here.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
i
think
--
and
i
think
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
if
i
might
say,
each
wrestled
with
that
problem
as
indeed
this
court
has
wrestled
with
it.
it's
not
an
easy
determination
to
make.
part
of
what
goes
into
making
that
determination
is
for
the
court
to
evaluate
the
intent
of
the
policymakers
because
if
the
court
finds
that
what
they
set
out
to
do,
what
they
intended
to
do
was
in
every
instance
possible
to
segregate
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
fact
that
they
may
have
been
incompetent
and
therefore
unsuccessful
in
some
instances
is
not
exculpatory.
that's
a
factor
to
be
considered.
the
court
has
to
consider
whether
the
racial
segregation
in
a
particular
school
is
the
result
of
patterns
over
which
the
school
officials
did
not
have
control
and
could
not
be
thought
reciprocally
to
have
impacted.
housing
is
one
such
instance
where
it
can
be
shown
their
policies
of
segregation
did
not
either
precede
or
go
lockstep
with
segregative
policies
on
the
part
of
the
other
state
empowered
people
such
as
realtors
or
licensed
people
such
as
brokers.
that's
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account.
this
court
specifically
noted
that
it
took
into
account
the
columbus
official's
system-wide
policy
with
respect
to
what
to
do
with
black
children
in
the
pre-1954
era.
and
the
answer
was
clear.
as
the
record
shows,
put
them
in
black
schools
wherever
possible.
it
said
it
considered
the
system-wide
policy
as
related
to
faculty,
a
policy
which
started
at
least
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
which
lasted
at
least
as
long
as
1974
when
they
couldn't
do
it
anymore
because
the
state
said
stop.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
1973.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
the
trial
was
1975-1976.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
that
was
essentially
the
claim,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
i
must
--
in
attempting
to
respond
to
that
--
complete
the
answer
i
didn't
want
to
fully
give
when
you're
asking
the
question.
the
claim
in
its
totality
was
that
the
school
officials
in
columbus
had
set
out
on
a
deliberate
policy
to
segregate
the
students
by
race
and
that
that
included
pre-brown
segregation
and
specific
maintenance
of
the
segregated
system
after
brown.
at
the
time
of
trial
--
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
that's
correct,
and
our
--
and
we
believe
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
court,
both
courts
below,
was
that
because
--
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
all
one-race
schools,
i
don't
know
the
specific
number.
that
was
not
the
claim
made
by
plaintiffs
that
they
were
all
one-race
schools.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
yes,
but
this
was
before
the
court
and
it
is
in
this
record
before
the
court
in
the
appendices.
i
don't
happen
to
recall
the
specific
number
of
schools
but
the
claim
made
by
the
plaintiffs
was
that
the
system
was
segregated
because
the
number
of
specific
segregative
actions
taken
by
the
defendants,
unremedied,
infected
a
substantial
portion
of
the
columbus
school
system
at
the
time
of
trial.
that
was
the
claim
and
it
was
a
claim
which,
on
the
basis
of
the
record
evidence
before
it,
the
court
credited
it.
we
believe
the
evidence
in
this
case
will
support
a
finding
that
--
and
the
brief
sets
it
out
more
fully
than
i
will
attempt
to
do
here
at
least
77
specific
constitutional
violations
affecting
at
least
149
schools
doing
the
part
--
during
the
period
of
time
covered
by
the
court's
analysis.
this
is
not
a
case
--
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
--
of
isolated
instances.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
i
understand.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
i
understand.
and
at
the
time
of
trial
--
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
the
evidence
at
the
time
of
trial
showed
as
i
recall
the
statistics,
that
70%
of
the
black
students
then
in
columbus
elementary
schools
were
in
schools
which
had
been
mentioned
by
record
evidence
before
the
district
court
as
having
been
specifically
impacted
by
segregative
activity.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
i
understand.
i've
already
answered
the
question
to
the
extent
--
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
i
can
--
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
--
by
saying
i
don't
know
the
specific
--
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
--
number
of
schools.
mr.
thomas
i.
atkins
i
didn't
count
that.
but
that
information
was
before
the
courts
below
as
it
is
here.
we
find
the
effort
by
the
petitioners
to
suggest
that
this
court
should
disregard
the
remedial
principles
that
have
so
clearly
and
we
think
consistently
set
forth
to
be
a
claim
which
should
be
rejected,
a
plea
which
should
be
rejected
by
this
court.
we
believe
the
record
shows
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
with
full
regard
to
the
teachings
of
this
court
evaluated
the
evidence
to
determine,
first,
the
scope
of
impact
from
the
violations
which
had
been
committed.
secondly,
the
extent
to
which
the
defendants
carried
the
burden
this
court
has
imposed
to
show
that
other
segregation
which
existed
was
not
also
the
result
of
their
impermissible
activity.
and
third,
to
articulate
a
remedial
plan
formulated
by
the
defendants
capable
of
addressing
the
full
reach
of
the
violation.
we
believe
that
has
happened
and
we
think
the
efforts
on
the
one
hand
to
characterize
the
record
as
a
record
showing
only
isolated
instances.
on
the
other
hand,
to
ignore
the
substantial
basis
for
the
district
court's
finding
of
a
pre-brown
dual
system
to
ignore
the
continuing
segregative
activity
this
court
--
the
courts
below
found
to
have
been
carried
out
by
these
defendants,
specifically
through
the
use
of
optional
zones
and
discontiguous
areas
not
solely
the
use
of
construction
but
including
that
by
the
faculty
and
administrative
assignment
policies
they
created
and
carried
out.
we
believe
on
that
record,
the
remedy
ordered
below
is
appropriate.
and
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
that
remedy
and
to
permit
the
students
in
columbus
to
receive
for
the
first
time
in
a
century
a
fully
adequate
and
fully
constitutional
education
in
the
public
school
systems
because
the
record
is
clear,
if
you
don't
permit
that
to
happen,
the
petitioners
will
certainly
not
make
it
happen.
we
have
no
place
to
go
from
here.
we
cannot
go
back
there
expecting
a
difference
from
the
patterned
behavior
which
has
up
to
this
point
been
proven
and
found.
and
we
ask
this
court,
we're
approaching
the
25th
anniversary
of
the
brown
decision.
in
columbus,
it
hasn't
meant
a
thing
and
we
ask
this
court
to
send
brown
to
columbus.
and
i
thank
you
very
much.
