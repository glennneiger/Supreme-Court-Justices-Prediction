mr.
samuel
h.
porter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
application
of
presumptions
of
intent
in
order
to
extrapolate
a
judgment
of
system-wide
liability
in
the
imposition
of
a
system-wide
racial
balance
remedy
from
conduct
where
a
system-wide
racial
balance
remedy
is
not
warranted
by
the
incremental
segregative
effects
of
the
identified
constitutional
violations.
i
wish
to
make
at
the
outset
a
brief
statement,
an
overview
of
the
columbus
public
school
system
in
the
remedy
that
the
court
ordered
in
this
matter
before
i
go
to
a
discussion
of
the
specific
errors.
and,
initially,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
ohio
state
board
of
education
was
a
party
below
and
has
filed
a
brief
concurring
with
the
petitioners'
view
and
their
position
is
fully
supportive
of
ours
and
we
in
turn
are
supportive
of
what
they
have
to
say
and
we
recommend
that
brief
to
the
court.
the
columbus
public
school
system
is
the
fourteenth
largest
city
school
system
in
the
united
states
and
like
most
school
systems
during
the
‘50s
and
‘60s.
it
went
through
an
enormous
period
of
growth.
in
1950,
it
had
a
school
enrolment
of
about
46,000
students.
it
grew
to
1971
of
--
to
about
110,000.
at
the
same
time,
its
area
increased
from
some
45
square
miles
to
170
square
miles,
one
of
the
largest
growths
that
took
place
anywhere
in
this
country.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
not
entirely,
mr.
justice
stewart.
they
--
there
are
some
exceptions
that
took
place
by
virtue
of
some
legislation
in
1958
which
made
it
that
time.
they
didn't
have
to
follow
each
other.
they
are
for
the
most
part
however,
particularly
since
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
1956
ordered
--
approved
a
transfer
of
a
number
of
pieces
to
the
city
of
columbus
that
had
been
authorized
by
the
ohio
state
board
of
education,
so
that
they
are
at
this
time
for
the
most
part
contiguous
but
not
entirely.
during
this
period
of
time,
the
school
system
added
103
school
buildings
and
they
added
145
additions
to
various
facilities,
some
old
and
some
that
were
build
during
that
time.
so
that,
at
the
time
of
trial,
the
system
consisted
of
170
school
buildings
with
97,000
students,
67
--
approximately
67%
white
and
approximately
32%
non-white.
school
--
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
37
--
67.5
white,
32.5
non-white.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
there
are
very
few
others.
there
are
a
few
but
they
are
insignificant.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
they
are
non-white.
in
the
early
‘70s
or
the
late
‘60s,
the
columbus
public
school
system
set
out
on
a
system
that
was
in
design
to
bring
about
voluntary
integration
of
its
school
system
and
it
entered
into
what
it
refers
to
and
what
is
described
in
the
court's
opinion
as
the
columbus
plan
racial
transfer.
they
also
set
about
a
program
of
magnet
and
alternative
schools,
a
series
of
career
centers
that
are
located
throughout
the
system,
and
they
attempted
to
what
--
new
attendants
areas
to
improve
racial
balance.
all
of
these
things
were
expanded
each
year
during
the
1970s.
and
although
the
racial
--
there
is
not
racial
balance
within
the
columbus
public
school
system
or
was
not
at
the
time
of
trial.
all
--
virtually
all
schools
were
racially
mixed
and
the
balance
within
the
schools
of
columbus,
their
racial
balance
was
superior
or
a
better
balanced
than
that
which
existed
within
the
residential
patterns
of
the
city
of
columbus
at
that
time.
all
schools
at
the
time
of
trial
had
balanced
faculties.
on
march
8,
1977,
the
district
court
found
that
the
entire
columbus
public
school
system
was
unlawfully
segregated
and
based
on
this
general
conclusion
of
system-wide
liability
and
without
determining
the
incremental
segregative
effect
ordered
a
system-wide
racial
balance
remedy.
and
they
did
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
determined
at
the
same
time
that
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
have
had
within
the
public
school
system
of
columbus
without
any
act
of
unconstitutional
conduct,
a
racially
balanced
system,
and
that
is
part
of
the
lower
court's
finding.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
if
the
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
it,
if
it
--
if
the
question
is,
“is
that
an
appropriate
finding
of
system-wide
liability
by
the
court
of
appeals?”
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
not.
if
the
question
is,
“are
we
raising
at
this
time
or
attacking
the
findings
by
the
district
court
with
respect
to
specific
violations?”
no,
we
are
not.
we
are
assuming
that
those
findings
were
correct
that
what
our
position
is
that
they
were
isolated
findings
and
that
they
cannot
support
a
system-wide
remedy.
and
we
go
further
and
say
that
the
sixth
circuit
--
that
judge
edwards
cannot
overcome
the
failure
to
make
specific
findings
simply
by
making
the
statement
that
he
does
make.
we
believe
that
he
is
required
under
the
date
and
case
to
make
specific
findings
of
fact
and
then
determine
the
incremental
segregative
effect.
the
order
that
the
district
court
--
the
order
of
desegregation
which
the
district
court
approved
ordered
the
reassignment
of
some
42,000
school
children,
it
ordered
the
transportation
for
a
racial
balance
of
37,000.
it
required
the
purchase
of
some
213
buses
with
an
--
with
using
those
buses
plus
the
old
fleet,
it
requires
four
starting
times
and
four
ending
times
during
the
day.
and
this
was
done
as
i
said,
even
though
the
court
had
found
that
if
the
columbus
system
had
never
acted
improperly,
the
racial
balance
would
not
be
accurately
reflected
within
the
system.
if
it
--
the
district
court
recognized
in
their
--
his
march
8,
1976
opinion
--
1977
opinion
that
racial
balance
--
imbalance
was
due
to
the
residential
patterns
within
the
city
of
columbus.
we
believe
that
the
question
that
they
presented
here
is
where
there
is
no
history
of
absolute
segregation
whether
compelled
by
statute
or
otherwise,
and
the
system
serves
urban
areas
with
large
and
highly
concentrated
black
population
where
there
is
substantial
residential
segregation.
can
you,
under
those
circumstances,
use
standards
and
presumptions
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
system-wide
remedy?
the
first
and
most
obvious
error,
was
that
the
court
--
lower
courts
failed
to
determine
the
current
incremental
segregative
effect
in
the
manner
required
by
dayton
i.
the
second
was
that
lower
courts
concluded
that
columbus
was
a
dual
system
through
the
improper
use
of
legal
presumptions
and
shifting
burdens
of
proof.
and
third,
the
lower
court
applied
an
erroneous
standard
for
determining
segregative
intent.
we
believe
that
dayton
i
sets
forth
the
required
approach
that
federal
courts
must
take
in
the
trial
of
school
desegregation
cases.
thus,
the
first
step
is
to
make
a
factual
determination
whether
there
were
specific
instances
where
the
school
board
attended
to
and
did
in
fact
discriminate
against
minorities.
and
if
such
constitutional
violations
are
ascertained,
then
the
court
must
determine
the
current
incremental
segregative
effect
of
these
violations
have
had
on
the
present
racial
school
population.
the
incremental
effect
is
to
be
measured
by
comparing
the
present
racial
distribution
in
the
schools
to
what
it
would've
been
if
the
constitutional
violations
had
not
occurred.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
yes,
because
--
mr.
justice,
because
the
--
simply
the
statement
that
there
is
a
finding
of
system-wide
is
meaningless
by
itself.
the
--
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
determination
of
what
was
the
effect
of
those
violations
presently,
what
--
and
what
is
the
incremental
segregative
effect
and
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
eliminate
it.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
we
believe
that
swann
and
green
are
remedy
cases.
they
are
de
jure.
we
believe
that
in
those
cases
that
you're
dealing
solely
with
remedy.
here
the
question
is
--
first,
violation.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
you
could
the
--
you
could
very
well
be
required.
the
court
could
very
well
be
required
to
make
a
finding
of
fact,
present
of
fact.
for
example,
suppose
the
system
has
gone
through
desegregation,
suppose
it
has
gone
through
racial
balance
and
it
in
fact
is
racially
balanced
such
as
in
pasadena
and
it
is
racially
balanced
and
then
it
gets
out
of
balance.
question
becomes
whether
or
not
there's
a
duty
and
obligation
and
so
forth
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
before
you
could,
you
would
have
to
make
the
determinations.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
if
i
followed
it
and
i
may
have
lost
it,
i
beg
your
pardon.
we
feel
that
there's
a
difference.
we
think
you
have
to
make
the
findings.
we
don't
think
that
you
can
get
to
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
system-wide
violation,
whether
there
is
de
jure
or
whether
there
are
state
imposed
constitutional
violations
throughout
the
system
without
making
the
types
of
factual
determinations
that
dayton
i
would
seem
to
indicate.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
no,
mr.
justice
powell,
not
in
dayton.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
when
it
went
back,
i'm
not
sure.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
recall.
i
know
very
well
what
the
--
this
court
said
about
swann,
and
--
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
the
swann?
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
the
--
this
court
discussed
it
as
a
starting
point
for
the
fashioning
of
a
remedy
and
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
what
we
say
is
that
you
can't
get
to
the
scope
of
the
remedy
until
you
determine
what
the
magnitude
of
the
wrong
is
and
you
can't
supply
the
wrong
or
its
magnitude
simply
by
the
statement
that
it
is
a
dual
system
or
that
it's
system-wide.
that
is
our
position
and
i
might
say
that,
in
studying
the
lower
court's
opinions,
one
has
to
very
careful
because
it's
obvious
after
a
reading
or
two
or
a
thought,
that
segregation
is
related
in
--
to
a
high
degree
within
those
opinions
to
racial
imbalance
and
the
two
we
would
suggest
are
not
the
same
but
they're
treated
to
a
high
degree
the
same.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
the
lower
court
--
the
trial
court
felt
that
there
were
specific
acts
of
unconstitutional
conduct
and
i
think
he
thought
that
they
were
those
10
or
11
which
he
identified
and
i
think
that
he
felt
that
there
was
racial
imbalance
throughout
the
system.
and
i
think
that
he
felt
that
there
was
an
obligation
to
remove
that
racial
imbalance
particularly
because
he
found
that
there
was
a
dual
school
system
in
1954.
and
what
--
and
he
really
runs
down
two
tracks
at
the
same
time.
one
is
the
dual
school
system
which
he
finds
required
the
dismantling.
the
second
is
a
separate
line
of
specific
unconstitutional
violations
after
1954
and
he
puts
them
all
together.
i
don't
know
how
to
--
i
don't
know
that
i
can
answer
your
question.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
well,
he
may
have,
although
i
don't
think
the
record
would
support
it.
but
i
would
point
out
that
if
that's
so
that's
the
very
reason
that
you
need
to
go
to
look
to
the
effect
to
see
what
is
the
scope
of
the
remedy
that's
going
to
be
required
in
order
to
rectify
whatever
that
wrong
was.
i
might
add
with
respect
to
reciprocal
effect
there
is
very,
very
little
in
the
record
on
reciprocal
effect.
i
think
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
was
from
mr.
sloane
who
said
that
he
had
never
studied
the
columbus
system
and
he
talked
about
it
in
the
general
way.
mr.
ta
--
dr.
taeuber
may
have
mentioned
the
principal
emphasis
on
reciprocal
effect
comes
in
the
appendix
to
the
respondents'
brief
which
was
of
course
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
we
would
--
i
would
like
to
talk
just
briefly,
i
think,
about
the
matter
of
presumptions.
before
i
do,
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
the
system
looked
like
in
1976
at
the
time
of
trial
with
regard
to
the
violations
that
have
been
found
by
the
district
court.
and
there
are
some
11
or
13
depending
on
how
you
count
them.
there
were
a
group
of
so-called
black
schools
enclave
which
he
found
had
been
created
prior
to
the
second
world
war
over
a
period
of
years.
three
of
those
schools
--
three
of
the
five
remained
in
1976
and
they
housed
3%
of
the
black
students
within
the
columbus
public
school
system.
he
found
that
there
were
two
sites
which
he
felt
run
--
unconstitutionally
selected.
one
of
them
had
been
eliminated
in
1973
with
an
integrative
effect.
one
of
them
remained
and
it
was
surrounded
by
black
schools.
there
were
three
optional
on
this
which
he
talked
about.
two
have
been
eliminated
in
the
early
‘60s.
one
in
1975,
so
that
there
were
none
at
the
time
of
trial
and
the
one
in
1975
involved
two
youngsters
and
they
went
to
racially
balanced
schools.
there
were
two
so-called
discontiguous
zones,
one
of
which
have
been
abolished
in
1963
and
one
of
which,
he
stated
or
the
inferences
from
his
statement
and
the
exhibits
will
show,
was
integrative
in
1968.
and
finally,
there
was
the
so-called
paring
of
innis
and
cassady
where
the
school
board
and
the
court
disagree
and
innis,
at
the
time
of
trial,
was
racially
balanced.
now,
these
are
the
violations
and
that's
all
there
were.
and,
it's
--
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
no.
we
think
that
the
evidence
fully
supported
your
honor,
a
finding
to
the
contrary
but
this
--
but
we
are
not
here
to
argue
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong.
that's
what
we
have
and
we
--
our
position
is
that
he
took
that
and
then
used
it
to
make
presumptions
of
system-wide
liability.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
and
this
argument,
we
will
not
take
issue
with
those
findings.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
over
the
75
years,
there
are
11
or
13
findings
or
specific
instances,
depending
on
how
one
counts
them.
i
think
that
is
accurate.
they
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
they're
discussed
in
detail
within
the
brief.
and
the
point
--
simply
the
point
that
we
want
to
make
is
that
you
can't
end.
i
would
point
out
that
the
record
and
his
opinion
does
not
support
the
proposition
that
they
are
examples.
they
are
not
examples
and
his
opinion
is
clear
that
they're
not
examples.
they
were
his
findings
of
fact.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
they
are
the
sum
total.
and
it's
--
this
is
the
springboard
for
the
moving
of
some
37,000
people
and
racially
balancing
170
schools.
and
what
--
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
about
1887
and
i
think
the
court
had
found
that
this
school
system,
racially
balanced
beginning
in
1881.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
mr.
justice
marshall,
that's
--
that
is
what
he
found.
he
also
stated
--
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
the
question
that
i
was
addressing
was
the
--
mr.

--
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
my
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart
was
that
the
columbus
public
school
system
was
in
--
an
integrated
system
in
1881.
and
as
stated
by
judge
duncan
in
his
opinion
and
order
that
condition
continued
until
the
early
1900s.
it
was
his
view
then
that
there
was
a
departure
about
1905
or
1906
which
at
that
time
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
what
he
found
was
the
creation
of
a
black
school.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
in
1954,
it
was
the
lower
court's
view
that
there
were
five
schools
which
constituted
an
enclave
in
the
center
of
the
city
--
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
--
which
had
been
--
which
were
the
result
of
unconstitutional
conduct.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
the
columbus
public
school
system
was
not
a
dual
school
system
in
1954
and
it
was
not
a
dual
school
system
in
1976.
there
was
substantial
racial
mixing
within
the
columbus
public
school
system
in
1976.
if
one
will
look
at
our
brief
for
example,
there
are
some
13
high
schools
in
existence
at
that
time
half
of
which
were
within
the
plus
or
minus
15%
of
the
racial
balance
requirement
of
judge
duncan,
half
of
the
columbus
public
school
high
schools.
and
several
of
them
are
within
a
point
or
two
and
it
is
our
position
that
under
those
circumstances
you
do
not
have
a
dual
school
system
and
you
cannot
use
simply
the
phrase,
“you
have
system-wide
liability,
dual
school
system
is
a
jumping
off
point
for
ordering
the
reassignment
of
42,000
people.”
and
we
think
that
dayton
is
correct.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
inconsistent
with
keyes,
which
i'm
obviously
not
going
to
get
to
but
we
think
that
the
presumption
in
keyes
is
not
inconsistent
with
dayton.
the
presumption
deals
with
intent.
it
deals
with
violation
and
there
was
no
finding
of
a
substantial
effect
on
the
columbus
public
school
system
in
1976
of
any
violations.
and
it
is
our
view
that
under
those
circumstances
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
ordered
the
remedy
that
he
ordered.
there
is
a
third
matter
that
appears
in
our
brief
that
deals
with
segregative
intent.
we
believe
that
the
wrong
standard
was
used.
we
think
that
--
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
five
or
six
or
eight
or
ten
in
a
system
of
170
square
miles
does
not
constitute
a
dual
school
system.
mr.
samuel
h.
porter
and
it
was
used
--
it
was
then
used
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
purpose
of
equating
whether
or
not
the
acts
of
the
school
system
tended
to
or
did
in
fact
improved
racial
balance.
and
we
suggest
and
argue
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
an
ap
--
the
appropriate
way
of
going
about
it.
that
obviously,
the
school
system
--
a
neighborhood
school
system
is
going
to
reflect
the
housing
patterns
of
the
community.
some
will
be
balanced,
some
will
not
be,
some
will
be
close,
and
so
forth.
i
would
like
to
conclude
simply
by
asking
this
court
or
pointing
out
to
the
court,
i
guess
more
accurately,
that
in
ohio
there
are
about
six
school
cases
going
on:
cleveland,
columbus,
dayton,
cincinnati,
akron,
youngstown.
they're
in
various
stages.
several
have
been
tried.
two
have
reached
one
result
in
the
district
court.
two
have
reached
another
result.
and
we
think
that
before
a
school
system
which
is
insolvent
is
asked
to
go
through
massive
relocations
and
massive
reassignments
that
there
should
be
--
the
district
court
should
be
required
to
make
very
definite
specific
findings
and
they
should
be
required
to
make
the
type
of
inquiry
that
dayton
i
calls
for.
if
it
isn't
dayton
i,
with
all
due
respect,
then
it
should
be
something
else
but
it
should
not
be
sufficient.
it
should
not
be
sufficient
to
simply
say
in
broad
generalities
that
a
condition
exists,
you
go
out
and
remedy
it.
there
are
many,
many,
many
remedies,
some
of
which
look
to
racial
balancing.
this
remedy
was
obviously
of
racial
balance,
was
the
only
thing
considered
by
the
district
court
and
it
was
the
only
thing
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
inappropriate
and
that
in
order
to
deal
with
this
type
of
situation
at
least
in
the
state
of
ohio,
specific
instructions
from
this
court
as
to
what
the
trial
courts
should
do
and
the
type
of
findings
that
they
should
make,
we
would
suggest
to
this
court
would
be
very
helpful.
and
i
wish
to
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
of
appearing.
