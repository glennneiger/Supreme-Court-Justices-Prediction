mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
turn
to
matters
that
i
want
to
specifically
address
in
my
argument,
i'd
like
to
try
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
with
respect
to
the
state
of
segregation
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
brought
to
trial.
at
the
time
of
trial
the
statistics
reflect
that
the
district
was
32%
black,
70%
of
the
black
children
attended
schools
that
were
80%
are
better
and
50%
of
the
schools
were
90%
of
one
race
or
the
other.
so
there
was
a
high
degree
of
racial
segregation.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
was
simply
trying
to
assist
the
court
based
upon
the
record.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
there
were
virtually
all-black
schools
in
columbus
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
would
think
not
because
of
the
record
in
this
case
which
is
that
there
was
no
state
statute
in
effect
at
the
time.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
it
was
not
the
type
of
complete
segregation
that
was
in
effect
in
--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
think
it's
also
helpful
to
understand
that
while
there
were
some
schools
in
the
district
at
the
time
of
trial
that
were
majority
black
and
majority
white,
they
reflected
a
continuation
of
a
pattern
that
was
in
effect
in
1954
when
the
court
found
that
five
schools
were
100%
all-black,
not
only
in
terms
of
their
student
body
but
their
faculty.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
that's
probably
true.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
that
the
information
with
respect
to
the
condition
of
the
schools
in
1954
reflects
the
fact
that
there
was
an
expressed
constitutional
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
board
as
of
1954
to
try
to
dismantle
a
system
that
was
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
dual
given
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
but
what
i'd
like
to
turn
to
is
really
--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
teachers?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
i
think
there
was
one
exception
to
--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
not
at
the
time
that
this
suit
was
brought.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
in
1954.
but
of
course,
at
the
time
that
this
suit
was
filed,
the
columbus
school
board
had
not
dismantled
the
system
that
involved
racial
assignment
of
teachers.
there
was
none
until
1974,
that
is
a
year
after
this
suit
was
filed,
that
the
columbus
school
board
finally
started
assigning
teachers,
not
based
upon
their
race
but
based
upon
neutral
principles.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
applied
the
principles
of
dayton
in
view
of
its
determination
that
a
system-wide
violation
existed
and
mr.
porter
has
indicated
here
today
that
he
accepts
those
findings
for
purposes
of
this
argument.
therefore,
columbus
is
a
remedy
case.
in
holding
that
judicial
remedies
must
be
addressed
to
the
incremental
segregative
effects
of
a
school
board's
discriminatory
policies,
dayton
i
did
not
establish
new
principles,
we
would
argue.
rather,
it
reiterated
the
subtle
precept
that
a
remedy
must
be
tailored
to
cure
the
condition
that
offends
the
constitution
by
eradicating
the
effects
of
that
violation.
when
there
have
been
only
isolated
and
sporadic
acts
of
school
board
discrimination
affecting
a
limited
number
of
schools
or
students,
a
similarly
limited
remedy
is
appropriate.
this
is
what
we
understand
to
be
the
teaching
of
dayton.
on
the
other
hand,
where
there
has
been
a
general
policy
of
discrimination
in
the
operation
of
a
school
system
as
a
whole
pervasively
eliminating
whatever
opportunities
existed
for
substantial
racial
integration,
a
system-wide
remedy
will
generally
be
required.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that's
an
issue
that
was
not
directly
addressed
in
the
dayton
decision.
it
does
not
address
what
we
think
is
the
central
issue
here,
which
is
the
proper
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
at
the
remedial
stage
when
a
court
must
enter
a
decree
that
eliminates
the
discriminatory
patterns,
the
root
and
branch.
we
think
that
based
upon
the
teachings
of
swann
and
keyes,
the
burden
of
showing
to
what
extent
the
system-wide
remedy
is
inappropriate
falls
upon
the
school
board.
keyes
and
swann
established
that
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
school
board
practices
that
have
been
system-wide
have
a
system-wide
effect.
it
presumes
that
the
discriminatory
practices
have
achieved
their
full
potential
in
the
school
system.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
what
is
the
issue?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
seems
to
me,
the
issue
has
to
be
a
showing
by
the
school
board
of
ways
in
which
its
own
discriminatory
pattern
did
not
in
fact
have
an
impact
upon
specific
schools
or
specific
areas
of
a
system,
but
that
burden
falls
upon
the
school
board.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we
do
not
contend
that.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
the
tipping
point
is
when
the
court
finds
that
there
is
a
system-wide
violation,
that
is,
where
the
discriminatory
practices
infect
the
entire
system.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
it
is
not
for
the
court
to
ask
questions
of
itself.
it
is
for
the
school
board
to
make
showings
of
ways
in
which,
for
example,
the
racial
assignment
of
faculty
did
not
have
an
impact
upon
certain
schools.
but,
you've
said
if
there
is
just
one
school
and
one
isolated
thing,
the
burden
doesn't
shift.
it's
not
up
to
the
school
board
and
that
--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
right
because,
by
definition,
if
it's
an
isolated
violation
then
one
can
easily
determine
--
a
court
can
easily
determine
what
the
remedy
will
be.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
burden
shifts
when
there's
an
establishment
of
a
system-wide
violation.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
and
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
where
the
court
pursued
questions
of
whether
faculty
assignments
were
discriminatory,
whether
citing
policies
were
discriminatory,
whether
optional
zones
and
discontiguous
zones
were
discriminatory,
once
it
arrived
at
a
judgment
that
the
system
was
segregated,
then
the
burden
shifted
to
the
school
board.
and
in
determining
what
constitutes
a
system-wide
violation,
courts
really
have
to
look
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
we
think
that
it's
appropriate
after
dayton
to
continue
to
believe
that
the
burden
for
showing
the
incremental
segregative
effects
should
fall
upon
the
school
board.
if
there
is
a
risk
of
uncertainty,
it
should
not
be
borne
by
the
victims
of
illegal
action.
this
is
particularly
applicable
in
cases
such
as
this
where
plaintiffs
seek
to
vindicate
rights
that
are
at
the
core
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
victims
of
purposeful
school
segregation
are
entitled
to
a
remedy
that
eliminates
the
effects
of
discrimination
root
and
branch.
and
clearly
a
system-wide
remedy
would
achieve
that
end
because
it
would
remove
the
racial
identifiability
of
the
dual
system
but
it
would
also
visibly
rectify
the
stigma
of
inferiority
which
is
indeed
the
product
of
pervasive
violations.
if
a
school
board
wishes
to
contend
that
a
less
inclusive
decree
would
purge
all
taints
of
its
proven
system-wide
racial
discrimination,
it
has
the
burden
of
showing
exactly
what
that
limitation
entails.
in
this
case,
the
columbus
board
did
not
carry
this
burden.
as
the
trial
court
stated,
defendants
had
ample
opportunity
at
trial
to
show,
if
they
could,
that
the
admitted
racial
imbalance
of
columbus
public
schools
is
a
result
of
social
dynamics
or
of
the
acts
of
others
for
which
defendants
owe
no
responsibility.
this,
they
did
not
do.
in
our
estimation,
given
the
establishment
of
a
system-wide
violation
and
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
columbus
school
board
to
show
why
that
system-wide
violation
did
not
warrant
a
system-wide
remedy
--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
judge
duncan,
when
he
issued
the
statement
that
your
honor
quoted
earlier,
was
of
course
operating
without
the
guidance
of
dayton.
that
was
a
march
opinion
and
of
course
dayton
came
down
several
months
later.
after
the
dayton
decision
came
down,
i
think
the
trial
court
understood
that
there
might
be
a
variety
of
considerations,
but
the
school
board
had
that
burden.
and
i
think
that
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
swann,
where
there
are
certain
one-race
schools
that
remain
after
there
has
been
a
showing
of
a
violation,
the
school
board
has
to
come
show
--
forward
and
show
why
those
one-race
schools
do
not
reflect
the
continuation
of
the
dual
system.
i
think
what
this
court's
decisions
have
indicated
is
that
these
types
of
decisions
have
to
be
made
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
on
a
case
by
case
basis
given
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
and,
given
--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
what
swann
says,
your
honor.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
there
is
a
significance,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
one
that
should
have
great
consequence
because
i
think,
in
the
dayton
case,
the
court
of
appeals
had
had
a
great
deal
of
experience
with
the
facts,
had
gone
through
the
record
on
several
occasions.
so
to
the
extent
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
factual
determinations
itself,
i
believe
that
those
findings
should
be
upheld
by
this
court.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
justice
--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--
white,
i
--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
don't
have
that
authority
at
the
tip
of
my
tongue,
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
think,
as
a
general
matter,
courts
of
appeals
would
remand
for
further
determinations
using
proper
principles,
but
i
think
it
is
not
unusual
nor
irregular
for
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
circumstances
of
a
case
such
as
this
to
make
its
own
determinations.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
recall
that
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
austin
case,
at
several
earlier
stages,
the
court
of
appeals
made
its
own
determinations
based
upon
the
record
of
facts
that
were
available
to
it.
so,
we
don't
have
a
court
of
appeals
either
there
or
here
making
determinations
outside
the
record
but
simply
drawing
from
the
record
facts
the
types
of
deductions
that
the
case
law
wants.
thank
you.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
i
may
have
created
some
confusion.
we
are
not
accepting
the
statements
of
the
district
court
concerning
system-wide
liability
or
the
need
for
system-wide
remedy,
which
simply
those
violations
for
the
purposes
of
this.
that's
all
i
have,
your
honor.
