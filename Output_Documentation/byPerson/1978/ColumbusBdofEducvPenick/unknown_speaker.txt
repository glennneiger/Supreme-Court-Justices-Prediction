mr.
porter,
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
this
should
be
done
even
if
there
is
a
supportable
finding
of
a
system-wide
violation.
unknown
speaker
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
there
were
de
--
a
de
jure
case
such
as
the
swann
case?
are
you
asking
us
to
reconsider
swann?
unknown
speaker
but
my
question
was
assuming
that
you
had
a
supportable
finding
of
a
system-wide
violation.
that
was
my
question.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
the
question
a
little
differently.
supposing
you
have
two
cases,
one,
a
de
jure
case
and
another
a
de
facto
case
in
which
there
is
admittedly
a
system-wide
violation.
and
in
both
cases
that
it
would
be
rather
clear
that
there'd
never
been
any
violation
at
all.
you
wouldn't
have
total
integration.
would
you
say
the
remedy
authorized
in
swann
is
appropriate
or
inappropriate
or
would
you
say
there's
a
difference
between
the
two
cases?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
