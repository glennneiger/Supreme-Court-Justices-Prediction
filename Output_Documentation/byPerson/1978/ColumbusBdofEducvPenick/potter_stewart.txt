is
the
school
district
--
are
there
boundaries
of
the
school
district
coterminous
with
the
boundaries
of
the
city
of

justice

stewart
all
the
others,
it
adds
up
to
99%.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
either
--
what
are
they
--
a
certain
--
white
or
non-white.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
concede
that
these
were
constitutional
violations?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
in
its
present
posture,
do
you
acknowledge
that
they
were
constitutional
violations?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
were
how
many,
three
--
four?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
the
sum
total.
justice
potter
stewart
and
racial
segregation
in
public
schools
has
been
illegal
under
the
law
of
ohio
since,
what,
the
1880s?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
any
constitutional
violations,
but
you've
earlier
told
us
and
i
thought
that
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
you
acknowledge
that
there
were
at
least
some
constitutional
violations.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
as
i
understand
it,
this
lawsuit
was
brought
in,
what,
1976?
justice
potter
stewart
1973
justice
potter
stewart
alleging
and
the
basis
for
the
lawsuit
was
and
had
to
be,
a
claim
that
the
columbus
school
board
was
then
violating
the
law
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
by
maintaining
a
dual
school
system,
i.e.
a
school
system,
ones
--
some
schools
for
negros
and
other
schools
for
white
people.
is
that
it?
that
was
their
claim,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
at
that
time,
how
many
all-white
or
all-black
schools
were
there
in
the
system?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
--
but
the
gist
of
the
lawsuit
had
to
be
that
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
school
board
of
columbus
was
maintaining
and
--
a
school
system
that
was
illegal,
incidentally,
under
the
law
of
ohio
and
also,
most
relevantly
here,
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
as
of
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
isn't
it?
doesn't
it
--
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
to
be
that?
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all,
what's
your
answer
before
you
get
too
far
away
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
my
question,
how
many
schools
at
that
time
were
all
one-race
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
a
dual
school
system,
i
think
--
i
should
suppose
that
would
be
rather
relevant
evidence.
i
mean,
if
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
--
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
relevant
time
is
the
time
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
claim
had
to
be
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
of
that
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
columbus
school
board
was
administering
an
officially
segregated
system.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
would
suppose
that
evidence
quite
relevant
to
that
was
how
many
schools,
as
of
that
time
were
all-white
and
all-black.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
doesn't
answer
my
question
at
all,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
that
really
doesn't
answer
my
question
either,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
schools
that
were
involved
in
brown
against
board
of
education
were
all-black
schools
and
all-white
schools
officially,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
any
of
these
in
columbus?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
any
of
the
kind
that
were
dealt
with
in
brown
against
board
of
education?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
--
what
i
meant
is,
does
the
record
show
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
what
was
involved
in
the
brown
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
would
agree,
i
suppose,
general
days,
would
you
not,
that
it's
pretty
well-established
that
what
the
constitution
requires
is
a
school
system
that's
racially
neutral,
that
no
child
and
no
parent
of
that
child
has
any
constitutional
right
to
attend
a
particular
school
with
any
particular
race
or
racial
balance.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
suppose
if
you
went
back
to
1854,
you
could
find
that
there
were
no
schools
for
negros
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
all
of
the
schools
were
100%
white.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
brought?
