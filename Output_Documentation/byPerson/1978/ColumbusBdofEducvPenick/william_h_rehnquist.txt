justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
porter,
don't
you
think
that
the
district
court's
findings
are
pretty
well-insulated
from
review
by
the
language
from
judge
edward's
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
which
is
at
page
199
of
the
petition
where
he
says
if
the
detailed
findings
in
this
paragraph
tracking
the
language
of
the
date
and
case,
and
he's
referring
to
the
district
court's
postdated
opinion,
cannot
appropriately
be
implied
from
the
district
judge's
post
datement--
date
and
opinion,
and
we
think
they
can
and
should
be.
we
now
enter
these
findings
as
the
findings
of
this
court
based
upon
the
6,600
pages
of
evidence
in
the
record
made
before
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
porter,
along
the
lines
of
justice
stevens'
question,
on
page
73
of
the
appendix
to
your
petition
which
has
judge
duncan's
opinion
in
it,
he
says
the
finding
of
liability
in
this
case
concerns
the
columbus
school
district
as
a
whole.
actions
and
omissions
by
public
officials
which
tend
to
make
black
schools
black
are
necessarily
have
the
reciprocal
effect
of
making
white
schools
whiter.
do
you
think
he
would've
found
the
system-wide
violation
if
there
had
just
been
segregation
in
one
school?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
don't
you
detect
at
least
from
that
part
of
his
opinion
that
he
perceived
a
ripple
effect
from
any
unconstitutional
act
of
segregation
that
would
eventually
have
--
make
its
effect
felt
throughout
the
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
atkins,
you
speak
of
the
court
remaining
true
to
its
teachings
in
dayton
and
i'd
like
to
ask
you
about
a
finding
of
judge
duncan
and
then
ask
you
about
some
language
from
dayton.
on
page
58
of
the
appendix
in
judge
duncan's
opinion,
he
says
in
the
middle
paragraph
there,
“the
interaction
of
housing
in
the
schools
operates
to
promote
segregation
in
each.
it
is
not
now
possible
to
isolate
these
factors
and
draw
a
picture
of
what
columbus
schools
or
housing
would've
look
like
today
without
the
other's
influence.
i
do
not
believe
that
such
an
attempt
is
required.”
and
then,
compare
that
with
our
language
in
dayton,
“if
violations
are
found,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
must
determine
how
much
incremental
segregative
effect
these
violations
had
on
the
racial
distribution
of
the
dayton
school
population
is
presently
constituted.
and
when
that
distribution
is
compared
to
what
it
would've
been
in
the
absence
of
such
constitutional
violations.”
don't
you
detect
some
inconsistency
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
think
the
court
meant
by
“system-wide
segregation?”
it
certainly
wasn't
the
sort
of
system
that
you
had
in
many
southern
states
at
the
time
of
brown
i
where
races
were
forbidden
to
attend
the
same
school
by
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
that
just
happened
once,
just
one
site
selection
that
taken
place
with
a
deliberately
segregative
attempt
on
--
intent
on
the
part
of
one.
do
you
think
that
would
justify
a
finding
of
system-wide
segregation
in
a
school
system
the
size
of
columbus
because
of
the
ripple
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
what
--
there
is
some
intermediate
finding
then,
i
take
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
everybody
concedes
that
the
district
court
has
to
make
between
a
single
segregative
act
and
the
imposition
of
a
system-wide
remedy.
what
factors
does
the
district
court
consider
in
making
that
finding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
days,
what
factors
does
the
court
consider
or
what
findings
ought
it
to
make
in
distinguishing
between
the
two
types
of
cases
that
you've
just
described?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
--
regardless
of
the
presumptions,
what
is
the
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say
that
if
you
proved
even
one
isolated
segregated
instance
that
that
would
shift
the
burden
to
the
school
board,
and
the
school
can
--
schools
district
consisting
of
176
schools
like
this,
to
show
that
none
of
the
others
have
been
affected?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
where
is
the
tipping
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
how
--
what
question
does
it
ask
itself
to
make
that
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
at
what
point
does
the
burden
shift?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
general
days,
judge
duncan
said
he
wouldn't
even
attempt
to
consider
the
influence
of
housing.
what
other
social
dynamics
could
the
school
board
have
called
to
his
attention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
days,
could
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
the
government
has
briefed
both
these
cases
together
and
--
can
we
assume
from
that
and
from
the
comment
on
page
44
of
your
brief
that
you
don't
regard
it
as
significant
that
judge
duncan's
findings
were
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
judge
rubin's
were
reversed?
