justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greer,
as
i
understand
it,
some
states
permit
different
elements
of
damages
and
recovery
for
wrongful
death
of
children
on
the
part
of
parents
and
others.
and
i
suppose
perhaps
the
tuning
that
you're
talking
about
might
have
something
to
do
with
what
elements
of
damages
are
permitted.
what
elements
of
damages
does
georgia
permit
you
to
recover?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it
--
it
could
include
a
loss
of
consortium
type
of
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
isn't
just
a
monetary
thing
that
the
child
would
have
supplied
you
with
so
much
money
over
the
year.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
possibility
of
double
recovery
if
you
prevail
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
do
you
think
this
court
goes
around
awarding
rights
to
various
--
in
the
relatives
to
recover
under
state
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
options
to
the
various
participants
in
this
case?
who
would
get
the
money?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
he'd
be
equally
surprised
to
find
he
had
an
action
for
wrongful
death
on
a
part
of
the
child
before
he
went
to
a
lawyer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
he
might
be
equally
surprised
to
find
out
that
he
had
a
lawsuit
for
wrongful
death
of
the
child
before
he
walked
into
a
lawyer's
office?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greer,
before
lunch
you
said
a
state
--
you
felt
there
is
emergence
--
propositions
require
a
state
to
strike
kind
of
a
middle
ground.
supposing
that
there
were
a
foster
father
of
this
child
who
had
done
everything
that
your
client
had
for
the
child
except
conceive
him.
would
you
think
the
state
had
to
permit
him
to
recover
under
wrongful
death
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
--
you
would
have
a
tougher
time
with
a
jury,
would
you
not
if
neither
parent
were
alive
simply
having
a
court
appointed
administratrix
testify
than
if
you
had
alive
mother
or
father
when
you're
testifying
under
the
issue
of
loss
the
value
of
companionship.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
lots
of
children
have
a
more
meaningful
relationship
with
their
parents
when
they're
seven
than
they
do
when
they're
15.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
particular
reason
--
i
notice
your
co-counsel
is
from
--
your
opponent
is
from
carleton
which
i
gather
is
in
western
georgia
and
that
this
suit
was
filed
in
the
richmond
county
court
which
i
gather
is
augusta.
is
there
any
venue
provision
that's
involved
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mr.
miller,
do
you
represent
the
maternal
grandmother
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
she
is
the
other
plaintiff
whose
action
you
said
was
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
represent
the
defendant
who
is
being
sued
for
negligence
as
a
result
of
the
wrong
--
claim
of
wrongful
death.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
a
little
difference
in
incentives
here
as
compared
to
the
inheritance
cases,
don't
you?
in
the
inheritance
cases,
it's
generally
the
illegitimate
child
who
is
striving
to
show
paternity
and
here
it's
a
little
bit
like
the
unknown
heirs
of
property
on
which
oil
is
discovered,
you
conceivably
have
the
incentive
in
the
illegitimate,
the
parent
who
fathered
the
illegitimate
child
rather
than
in
the
illegitimate
child.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
like
there
may
be
more
than
one
unknown
error
at
the
wellhead
where
oil
is
found.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
on
page
4
of
the
appendix,
because
the
natural
father,
he'd
execute
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
birth
certificate.
