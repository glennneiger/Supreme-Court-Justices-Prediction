but
he
would've
been
under
a
legal
duty
in
georgia,
wouldn't
he,
to
support
a
minor
child
if
he
were,
if
it
were
clear
that
he
was
the
father?
justice
potter
stewart
not
until
he's
identified?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
father,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
surprise
was
to
find
that
under
georgia
law,
he
didn't.
justice
potter
stewart
you'd
have
a
very
hard
time
proving
damages
among
other
things,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
how
old
was
this
child
at
the
time
of
his
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
seven?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
of
his
death.
justice
potter
stewart
is
gender-based
discrimination,
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
the
child's
mother
is
dead.
justice
potter
stewart
killed
in
the
same
accident.
so
and
under
georgia
law,
i
suppose
the
child
would
have
been
--
become
a
legitimate
child
had
the
mother
and
father
been
married
after
his
birth?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
--
been
the
only
way
to
make
the
child
illegitimate,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
to
legitimate
the
child?
justice
potter
stewart
how
to
--
what?
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
to
acknowledge
paternity
but
to
legitimate
the
child.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
child
from
bastard
he
is
--
correct
word
to
--
to
a
legitimate
child.
justice
potter
stewart
or
whether
she
was
married
to
somebody
else?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
under
georgia
law,
had
she
been
married
to
somebody
else
when
the
child
was
born,
it
would've
been
her
husband's
child,
by
presumption
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
but
if
the
mother
and
father
were
married
and
the
child
were
illegitimate,
they
would
not
share
under
georgia
law,
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
the
mother
gets
it
all,
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
would
be
a
valid
interest
if
this
were
a
question
of
whether
or
not
an
illegitimate
father
could
inherit
or
something
like
that
but
you
don't
have
to
look
for
parents.
see,
there's
a
plaintiff
in
a
lawsuit.
he
found
himself
and
walked
into
court
and
filed
a
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
hadn't
you
would
have
no
duty
whatsoever.
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
under
georgia
law,
the
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child
can
sue
for
the
wrongful
death
of
that
child.
a
father
who
has
legitimated
the
child
can
also
sue
for
the
wrongful
death
of
the
child
if
there
is
no
mother.
a
father
who
has
not
legitimated
a
child
however
is
precluded
from
maintaining
a
wrongful
death
action.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
this
statutory
scheme
violates
the
equal
protection
or
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
denying
a
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
who
has
not
legitimated
the
child
the
right
to
sue
for
the
childâ€™s
wrongful
death.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
the
georgia
law
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
an
opinion
i
have
filed
this
morning,
which
has
been
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
well
as
the
reasons
set
out
in
a
concurring
opinion
filed
by
mr.
justice
powell,
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
mr.
justice
blackmun,
have
joined.
