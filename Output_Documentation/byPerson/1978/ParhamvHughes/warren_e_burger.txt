chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
parham
against
hughes.
mr.
greer,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
the
charge
in
legislature
could
abolish
the
old
claims
for
deaths
by
wrongful
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case
whether
the
mother
is
living
or
dead
or
whether
the
child
ever
saw
the
father?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
a
constitutional
obligation
on
every
state
to
attune
its
statutes
to
fit
every
conceivable
situation
that
may
arise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
do
you
mean
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
in
each
case,
the
court
just
got
to
inquire
into
the
degree
how
much
was
contributed
to
what
the
personal
relationship
was
between
the
father
and
the
child
in
order
to
make
the
evaluation
on
--
that
you're
pressing
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
meet
what,
to
meet
equal
protection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
is
the
consequence
of
the
certificate
or
the
paper,
whatever
it
was
that
you
found
after
the
child's
birth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
have
been
any
more
difficult
to
acknowledge
that
paternity
and
legitimatize
the
child
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
you're
making
those
all
these
alternative
arguments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
strong
interest
but
it
hadn't
been
strong
enough
to
lead
him
to
change
the
child's
status
to
one
of
legitimacy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
didn't
have
any
trouble
going
to
a
lawyer
and
getting
some
legal
advice
after
the
child's
death,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
know
that
he
had
done
everything
that
he
knew
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
it
an
equally
possible
hypothesis
that
he
is
willing
to
go
that
far
but
he
didn't
want
to
take
the
steps
to
make
the
child
legitimate
because
it
might
increase
his
liabilities
and
responsibilities.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
mother
had
been
killed
in
the
accident
--
had
not
been
killed
in
the
accident?
she
survived,
i
take
it,
it
would
be
your
position
that
the
mother
and
the
father
would
share
in
a
claim
for
death.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
would
claim
here
if
she
survived
and
brought
the
action
that
he
could
intervene
and
share.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
talking
about
some
other
statute.
i'm
talking
about
the
statute
of
georgia
as
it
is
today.
would
you
claim
the
mother
and
the
father
would
have
to
share
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
not
a
--
not
in
a
joint
suit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
under
georgia
law,
that
does
not
make
the
child
illegitimate,
is
that
what
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
to
file
a
petition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
miller.
do
you
have
anything
further
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case
if
the
father
had
never
seen
the
child
after
the
child's
birth,
hadn't
filed
--
hadn't
done
anything
about
the
birth
certificate
on
your
equal
protection
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
red
light
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
will
tell
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
disposition
of
78-3,
parham
against
hughes
will
be
announced
mr.
justice
stewart.
