mr.
a.
montague
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
perhaps
one
of
those
unusual
cases
when
insofar
as
the
appellee
is
concerned,
the
defendant
in
the
lower
court,
it
really
makes
no
difference
to
him
whether
he
wins
or
loses
before
this
court.
the
facts
i
think
in
order
to
clarify
the
reason
for
a
lack
of
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
the
defendant
was
sued
by
both
the
father
of
the
illegitimate
child
and
by
the
grandmother
as
administrarix
of
the
estate.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
no
sir.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
net
effect.
the
mother's
case
has
already
been
settled
because
there
were
no
hindrances
in
that
action
as
they
are
here
and
they
will
be
if
this
court
rules
a
statute
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir,
that's
my
approach
here.
of
course
as
a
lawyer
having
to
practice
in
the
state
of
georgia,
i
would
defend
the
statute
vigorously.
i
think
that
it's
difficult
for
the
court
sometime
to
understand
the
problems
that
we
have
in
the
area
of
illegitimate
children
and
fathers
who
cannot
be
located.
and
i
think
that
it
is
a
real
interest
to
be
protected
of
the
state
of
georgia
in
passing
the
act
which
they
did
pass.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
it's
code
section
105-1309
provides
that
--
mr.
a.
montague
miller
there
is
no
windfall
whatsoever.
and
the
measure
of
damages
may
it
please
the
court,
is
the
full
value
of
the
life
of
the
decedent
without
deduction
for
necessities,
whether
that
be
for
an
adult,
an
illegitimate
child
or
a
legitimate
child.
the
measure
is
the
same.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
the
recover
for
the
estate
would
be
the
full
value
of
the
life
of
the
decedent
without
deduction
for
necessities
as
set
forth
by
demands
of
an
enlightened
and
impartial
jury.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
it
is
the
same
the
measure
in
writing.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
i'm
referring
mr.
justice
white
to
the
estate
of
the
child
in
this
instance.
but
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make
is
that
the
measure
of
damages
is
the
same
whether
the
suit
is
by
a
mother
for
the
death
of
a
child,
by
a
father
for
a
death
of
the
child
or
by
the
administrator
or
administratrix
for
the
death
of
a
child
or
for
a
grown
up
for
that
matter.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
no
sir.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
certainly
can't
deny
that
that
is
a
problem
which
would
present
itself
but
likewise
i
cannot
deny
that
when
a
child
is
dependent
upon
a
parent
that
increases
perhaps
the
value
of
that
child's
life.
i
don't
see
how
you
could
ever
get
around
that.
and
i
think
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
child
is
seven
or
21
or
whether
the
mother
and
child
had
a
meaningful
relationship.
or
any
other
number
of
things
which
would
throw
some
light
on
the
valuable
person's
life.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
again
i
think
that
the
court
should
understand
the
posture
in
which
the
case
got
here
and
that
is
that
the
defendant
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
pending
action.
and
that
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
defendant
was
opposed
by
an
affidavit
of
the
father
of
the
illegitimate
child
and
those
are
all
of
the
facts
that
happened
to
be
before
the
court.
so
there
may
be
some
facts
that
the
court
has
inquired
about
that
no
one
knows
because
the
superior
court
of
richmond
county
here
that
the
affidavit
of
the
father
has
two
of
these
facts
were
taken
as
true
and
therefore
rendered
its
decision
based
upon
that.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
that
that
is
a
correct
statement
and
i
think
that
it
is
also
correct
that
the
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child
does
not
inherit.
and
i
think
that
is
the
better
question
which
should
be
brought
to
this
court
for
the
decision
and
that
is
who
the
heirs
at
law
of
a
person
who
is
illegitimate.
and
i
think
that
that
would
eliminate
an
awful
lot
of
problems
that
would
be
brought
forth
in
the
event
that
this
court
would
hold
the
georgia
statute
unconstitutional
because
eventually
you
will
find
that
if
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
then
of
course
the
right
of
action
in
the
mother
is
unconstitutional.
perhaps
the
right
of
action
vested
in
the
mother
of
a
legitimate
child
to
the
exclusion
of
the
father
is
unconstitutional
and
then
we
don't
have
any
rights
of
action
for
wrongful
death
in
the
state
of
georgia
because
they're
all
based
thereon.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
it
would
be
a
windfall
then.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
well
they
don't
have
much
time,
it'd
be
awhile.
they're
only
in
session
for
40
days
when
they
had
begun,
they'll
finish
in
january,
the
first
part
of
their
work.
i
think
that
in
this
case,
that
we
should
think
for
a
minute
about
not
only
the
problems
that
might
be
caused
but
by
the
manner
in
which
the
state
of
georgia
has
treated
illegitimate
children.
georgia
by
statute
has
allowed
a
father
to
file
a
petition
to
legitimate
the
child
and
it's
a
very
simple
matter.
it's
simply
a
petition
brought
in
the
county
where
the
trial
resides,
stating
that
he
is
a
father
and
he
can
have
the
child
assume
his
name
if
he
so
decides.
it's
not
a
very
difficult
thing
and
i
think
to
decide
a
case
based
upon
the
level
of
awareness,
it
might
exist
through
the
citizens
to
the
state
for
a
law
that
has
been
on
the
books
now
for
92
years
and
has
never
been
challenged
by
anyone,
father,
mother
or
otherwise.
so
it
must
be
a
very
unique
situation
in
one
which
i
would
submit
to
the
court
would
allow
the
state
to
proceed
as
it
did
and
to
hold
that
this
particular
statute
is
constitutional.
it
was
passed
in
1887
and
amended
one
time
in
1952.
prior
to
that
time,
of
course
there
was
no
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
by
common
law.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
suit
must
be
brought
in
the
county
of
the
residence
of
the
defendant
if
he
is
a
resident
of
the
state
where
the
acts
did
occur
so
that
was
his
only
venue.
we
also
in
the
codification
of
the
laws
have
stated
on
numerous
occasions
in
the
statutes
that
there
can
be
no
discrimination
on
account
of
a
person
being
illegitimate
that
there
can
be
no
defense
of
a
child
being
illegitimate
in
action
brought
by
the
mother
whether
in
her
own
right
or
in
a
representative
capacity
or
as
the
mother.
and
that
a
mother
can
proceed
to
file
an
action
and
collect
the
proceeds
arising
out
of
the
death
of
her
child,
natural
child
whether
it
be
legitimate
or
not.
i
can
find
no
reason
to
vary
from
the
most
recent
decision
of
lalli
v.
lalli
or
the
quilloin
decision
in
arriving
at
the
constitutionality
of
this
case.
in
the
quilloin
v.
walcott,
the
options
that
are
available
and
were
available
to
this
father,
here
the
father
are
the
same.
and
mr.
justice
marshall
writing
on
a
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court
stated
that
necessarily
it
existed
that
the
father
could
have
brought
a
petition
to
legitimate
the
child
and
therefore
obtain
a
veto
right
over
the
adoption
of
the
child.
and
i
would
think
that
it
must
be
that
the
interest
of
a
father
in
being
able
to
veto
the
adoption
of
a
child
would
far
outweigh
the
right
of
a
father
to
bring
an
action
for
damages
for
the
death
of
a
seven-year
old
child.
it
is
incomprehensible
to
me
that
that
would
not
be
true
and
this
court
held
that
since
that
was
some
middle
ground
that
the
father
could
take
that
is
between
exclusion
in
a
case-by-case
method
or
in
the
trimble
case
having
to
marry
the
mother
that
he
could
in
this
instance
bring
a
very
informal
petition
and
legitimate
the
child
and
thereby
could
have
obtained
the
veto
rights
to
their
adoption.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
no
sir,
i
represent
the
defendant.
the
maternal
grandmother
is
the
other
plaintiff.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
that's
correct.
in
the
lalli
case
of
course
this
court
again
held
in
looking
at
the
new
york
statute,
mr.
justice
powell
writing
the
decision
that
the
father,
punitive
father
could
have
in
that
instance
brought
a
petition,
i
think
it
would
be
a
petition
to
legitimate
the
child
by
simply
doing
his
lifetime
acknowledging
the
child
and
thereby
the
child
would
have
been
able
to
inherit
from
the
father's
estate.
and
although
the
decision
was
five
to
four,
i
submit
that
the
rationale
there
is
the
same
as
exists
here
and
that
the
interim
step
was
also
available
to
the
father.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
a
value
to
the
state
in
my
opinion
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
a
value
to
the
state
in
that
we
are
able
to
dispose
of
litigation
without
having
to
look
for
parents
and
i
realize
while
it
might
appear
that
this
court
has
rejected
that
before
i
think
that
it
is
now
a
valid
argument.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
that
is
--
mr.
a.
montague
miller
that's
correct
but
it's
not
unusual
in
our
state
to
have
more
than
one
person
and
sometimes
several
making
claims
to
one
source.
and
what
it
means
just
very
practically
is
that
you
cannot
so
with
any
punitive
father
until
you
have
a
decision
from
the
highest
court
in
that
state
--
mr.
a.
montague
miller
--
that
he
is
the
father.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
and
that
means
that
i've
got
to
defend
everyone
of
them.
i
can't
settle
it
and
another
jury
two
months
from
there
may
decide
that
the
facts
in
that
case
prove
this
case
and
then
i
don't
have
a
double
recovery
which
i
think
is
a
real
issue.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
that's
the
way
the
record
appear,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
what
happened
--
mr.
a.
montague
miller
the
state
would
not
have
had
i
do
not
think
any
trouble
to
--
mr.
a.
montague
miller
i
don't
think
i
would
have
any
trouble
locating
this
man.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
because
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
that
what
you
do
if
you
rule
a
statute
unconstitutional
that
you
would
have
to
extend
some
law
to
say
that
this
was
a
formal
acknowledgment
and
a
formal
acknowledgment
is
all
that's
necessary.
now,
what
happened
is
simply
that
either
the
mother
or
father
signs
a
birth
certificate.
and
that's
all
that
happened.
the
father
signed
the
birth
certificate.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
no
sir.
the
birth
certificate
as
your
honor
knows
have
been
issued
retained
--
mr.
a.
montague
miller
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
i
cannot
answer
that
yes
or
no
but
i
--
the
state
is
by
law
has
placed
a
burden
of
obtaining
birth
certificates
not
on
the
past
but
rather
on
the
hospital
or
physicians
that
deliver
the
child.
and
i
would
like
to
answer
your
question
no
because
i
don't
recall
it
being
that
way
but
i
would
be
presumptuous
to
do
so.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
that's
correct
sir.
i
agree
with
that.
but
with
a
pool
of
money
comes
perhaps
more
than
one
punitive
father
and
they're
in
lines
of
a
real
problem.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir
and
as
each
well
is
struck,
the
heirs
generally
come
forward.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
he
signed
the
birth
certificate.
either
the
mother
or
the
father
signed
the
birth
--
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
what
else
did
the
state
need
more
than
that?
mr.
a.
montague
miller
the
statute
says
that
he
has
a
right
to
legitimate
the
child
and
i
don't
think
that
the
state
of
georgia
has
to
acquiesce
and
say
that
that
is
sufficient
acknowledgment
of
a
child
to
make
the
child
no
longer
illegitimate.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
no
sir,
it
does
not
make
the
child
legitimate.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
or
marry
the
mother.
either
or.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
no
sir.
i
doubt
that
very
seriously.
i
would
think
he'd
probably
love
the
child.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
montague
miller
they
do
not
locate
them.
they
leave
that
either
to
the
child
or
to
the
mother
to
bring
that
action.
it
is
a
criminal
statute
but
--
also
but
i
never
heard
of
that
being
applied
by
the
state
unless
it
was
to
recoup
some
benefits
that
have
been
paid
or
an
action
was
requested
by
the
child
or
by
the
mother.
and
lastly
i
think
that
i
wanted
to
point
--
i
wanted
to
cover
is
that
i
know
of
no
way
really
that
a
mother
can
legitimate
a
child.
i
do
believe
that
if
that
were
true,
there'd
be
very
few
cases
in
which
a
child
would
remain
illegitimate.
i
think
on
some
occasions
certainly
a
mother
would
not
want
to
legitimate
a
child
but
if
it
didn't
require
her
to
marry
the
father
but
simply
legitimate
the
child,
i'm
sure
that
there
would
be
no
illegitimate
children
and
therefore
no
problems
that
we
have
today
in
this
particular
action.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
rational
and
reasonable
state
interest
to
be
protected
and
i
submit
that
the
vague
generalities
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
do
not
require
that
each
case
be
decided
on
its
merits
which
would
be
certainly
not
required
and
that
they
can
do
as
they
did
in
enacting
the
statute
provide
that
the
father
could
recover
for
the
death
of
the
child
if
he
married
the
mother
or
filed
a
petition
to
legitimate
the
child.
thank
you.
