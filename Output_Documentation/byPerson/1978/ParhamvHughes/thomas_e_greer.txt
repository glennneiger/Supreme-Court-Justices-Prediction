mr.
thomas
e.
greer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
georgia
may
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
united
states
constitution
allow
the
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child
to
recover
for
the
wrongful
death
of
that
child
and
deny
that
right
to
the
father
of
the
child
despite
the
fact
that
the
mother
is
deceased
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
father
maintained
a
meaningful
relationship
with
that
child.
and
it
presents
to
relate
a
question
of
whether
the
present
classification
constitutes
impermissible
gender-based
discrimination.
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
this
opinion
makes
the
point
over
and
over
again
that
the
legitimate
state
interest
to
be
promoted
by
the
present
classification.
there's
a
discouragement
of
an
illegal
act.
the
illegal
act
that
classifications
is
purported
to
discourage
is
the
creation
in
the
birth
of
children
out
of
wedlock.
that
illegal
act
has
two
participants,
each
of
an
equal
degree
of
participation
and
each
of
an
equal
degree
of
complicity.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
that
they
could
abolish
all
claims
for
a
death
by
wrongful
act?
i
would
think
to
say
that
georgia
could
constitutionally
do
that.
and
yet
despite
the
fact
that
these
parties
have
an
equal
degree
of
participation
in
the
act
that
the
state
seeks
to
discourage,
one
of
those
parties
has
accorded
all
the
rights
of
a
natural
parent.
she
has
accorded
all
the
rights
of
a
natural
parent
without
regard
to
what
her
actual
relationship
with
the
child
was
and
she
has
re
--
she
has
accorded
those
rights
without
the
necessity
of
being
affirmative
action
on
her
part.
by
contrast,
the
state
has
singled
out
the
other
participant
in
the
illegal
act
as
the
member
who
will
serve
as
the
state's
means
of
discouraging
that
act.
he
has
accorded
none
of
the
rights,
accorded
a
natural
parent
unless
he
takes
affirmative
action.
appellant
submits
that
in
cases
like
the
present
one
that
the
classification
before
the
court
constitutes
impermissible
gender-based
discrimination
and
is
otherwise
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clause.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor,
i
think
it
makes
a
tremendous
amount
of
difference
because
i
don't
think
the
georgia
legislature
is
obligated
to
absolutely
guarantee
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
the
right
to
participate
in
the
recovery.
i
think
that
the
message
of
trimble
versus
gordon
and
stanley
versus
illinois
and
weber
versus
aetna
casualty
is
that
the
state
must
carefully
attune
its
alternatives
in
this
area.
i
think
that
georgia
has
failed
to
carefully
tune
its
alternatives.
i
think
it
could
have
a
carefully
tuned
statute
like
it
--
like
several
other
states
have.
for
example,
washington
state
has
a
statute
which
establishes
a
preferential
scheme
of
recovery
that
allows
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
to
participate
in
that
recovery
if
he
had
done
one
of
two
things.
no,
if
he
done
both
two
things,
if
he
could
prove
his
paternity
and
if
he
had
regularly
contributed
for
the
support
of
the
child.
maryland
has
a
similar
statute.
maryland
allows
him
to
participate
in
the
recovery
if
he
can
prove
that
he
either
had
his
paternity
judicially
established,
that
he
acknowledge
his
paternity
in
writing
or
that
he
had
openly
and
notoriously
acknowledged
the
child
as
his
own
during
the
child's
life.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
your
honor,
not
every
conceivable
situation
that
may
arise.
i
do
think
a
blanket
exclusion
of
fathers
of
illegitimate
child
--
illegitimate
children
offends
the
equal
protection
clause
when
a
state
may
carefully
attune
its
alternatives
and
still
protect
its
interest
in
the
area
which
i
think
the
state
of
georgia
has
failed
to
do
in
the
present
matter.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
georgia
allows
recovery
for
the
value
of
the
life
of
a
child,
it's
a
--
and
then
its
subject
purely
to
the
jury's
discretion
from
that
point
forward.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
it
includes
--
instructions
have
been
approved
which
allow
the
jury
to
consider
the
loss
of
companionship
issue.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
georgia
legislature
expressly
repealed
the
statute
in
1952
that
require
the
contribution
by
the
minor
to
the
support
of
the
parents.
the
minor
child,
lemuel
parham
was
born
of
course
to
the
appellant
curtis
parham
and
cassandra
moreen
out
of
wedlock.
the
child's
mother
cassandra
moreen
was
killed
in
the
same
accident
which
took
the
child's
life.
this
original
action
was
instituted
in
the
superior
court
of
richmond
county.
that
court
held
the
georgia
wrongful
death
statute
unconstitutional
and
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
in
doing
so,
they
made
several
findings
of
fact
which
i
think
are
critical
to
this
case.
they
found
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
your
honor,
not
as
much
--
no,
your
honor,
they
were
not.
they
found
that
while
the
deceased
child
was
an
illegitimate
child
that
the
father
had
executed
the
child's
birth
certificate
at
his
birth,
acknowledging
his
paternity
that
the
father
had
paid
the
birth
expenses,
that
he
had
regularly
supported
the
child
from
its
birth
until
its
death
that
he
had
at
all
times
acknowledged
the
child
as
his
son
and
was
acknowledged
by
the
child
as
his
father.
the
record
reflects
that
the
child
utilized
the
father's
name
and
not
the
mother's.
the
court
went
on
to
find
that
in
addition
to
paying
regular
support
that
the
appellant
had
maintained
charged
accounts,
had
grocery
stores
to
further
provide
necessities
for
the
support
of
a
child.
and
the
court
found
finally
that
he
had
maintained
a
consistent
relationship
of
visitation
and
in
fact
visited
with
the
child
virtually
everyday
and
have
the
child
for
many
complete
weekends
and
by
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor
that
action
is
pending.
it
has
been
enjoined,
the
administratrix
system,
maternal
grandmother.
with
regard
to
that
point
your
honor,
think
the
court
--
that
is
the
point
made
by
the
appellee
in
the
appellee's
brief
is
that
it
is
not
as
though
there
has
been
no
provision
for
recovery.
i
think
this
court
made
the
point
in
weber
versus
aetna
casualty
that
the
real
question
in
referring
back
to
levy,
the
real
question
is
not
whether
there
is
a
steam
of
recovery
but
whether
there
is
a
scheme
of
recovery
which
comports
with
the
mandate
of
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
united
states.
so
there
is
another
action
pending
but
i
think
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
scheme
of
recovery
that
exists
is
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
trial
court
found
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
your
honor.
i
represent
the
appellant
mr.--
of
the
actual
father.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
pending
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
legitimate
children,
she
would.
in
the
case
an
illegitimate
child,
the
father
is
blanketly
excluded
from
participation.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
think
the
--
there
would
be
a
prospect
of
an
invalidation
of
--
well,
i
can
see
theoretically
how
that
case
could
proceed
and
the
question
might
be
who
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
recovery
of
the
proceeds
but
the
superior
court
of
richmond
county
chose
to
enjoin
that
case
pending
a
decision
in
this
case
for
fear
that
it
might
proceed
with
that
trial
and
the
father
might
be
declared
the
proper
party
to
maintain
the
action.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no,
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
and
maybe
i
didn't
make
myself
clear
enough.
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
the
proper
--
that
a
proper
decision
in
this
case
would
be
that
the
georgia
statute
is
not
at
the
present
time
carefully
tuned
alternative
considerations
and
that
would
leave
georgia
any
number
of
options.
perhaps,
i
realize
this
court
does
not
award
an
explicit
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
this
case,
the
father
would
be
the
appropriate
party
if
he
prevailed
in
this
action.
the
father
of
a
legitimate
child
is
given
that
benefit.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor
that
is
correct
and
that
is
an
issue
i
think
the
paramount
and
pollex
in
this
case
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
address
it
now.
mr.
justice
marshall
in
a
unanimous
opinion
for
this
court
in
quilloin
versus
walcott
declined
the
rest
of
decision
of
that
court
--
of
this
court
in
that
case
on
the
fact
that
the
father
had
an
option
to
legitimate.
he
did
so
in
that
case
based
on
the
fact
that
there
were
some
indication
in
the
record
that
he
did
not
know
the
availability
of
it.
and
at
least
two
other
cases,
trimble
versus
gordon
and
stanley
versus
illinois,
this
court
has
also
declined
to
decide
those
cases,
those
respective
cases
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
an
option
to
legitimate.
in
those
cases,
the
argument
was
that
he
was
no
insurmountable
barrier
to
recovery,
that
the
father
could
have
legitimated
the
child
which
is
the
argument
made
here,
that
he
could
have
left
a
will
providing
for
the
child.
but
the
court
ruled
in
those
cases
that
the
--
when
attacked
on
equal
protection
grounds,
it
must
survive
traditional
equal
protection
analysis.
and
at
the
presence
or
absence
of
an
insurmountable
barrier
can
alter
those
considerations.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
excuse
me?
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
yes
sir
i
do
think
--
i
think
the
danger
of
resting
a
decision
of
this
importance
on
that
issue
is
--
but
i
think
it
would
be
ironic
if
you
have
the
relationship,
the
degree
of
a
relationship
that
you
have
between
a
father
and
a
child
in
this
case.
and
if
you
rest
the
decision
on
these
grounds,
i
think
it's
ironic
that
mr.
parham
in
this
case
could
have
legitimated
the
child,
a
naked
formality,
he
could've
had
no
relationship
whatsoever
with
that
child,
never
supported
it,
never
visited
it,
never
had
any
contact
with
it
all
and
presumptively
would
been
--
would've
been
entitled
to
bring
this
action.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
he
is
under
a
legal
duty
anyway.
without
regard
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
yes
sir.
i
mean
but
the
--
primary
support
obligation
for
an
illegitimate
child
is
placed
on
the
father.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
yes
sir.
but
it
would
be
ironic
that
he
could've
observed
that
formality
and
been
entitled
to
recover
without
regard
with
relationship
and
yet
he
has
the
degree
of
relationship
that
he
has
and
might
be
denied
that
right
because
he
didn't
observe
the
formality
and
i
think
that
that
argument
assumes
a
level
of
awareness
with
regard
to
the
necessity
and
the
availability
of
legitimating
petitions
that
in
reality
just
doesn't
exist.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
would
never
file
a
petition,
no
sir,
the
appeal
if
he
had
not
had
a
relationship
with
the
child.
i
don't
have
any
question
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
deny
a
father
who
has
never
had
a
relationship
with
his
child
an
absolute
failure
to
participate.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
she
certainly
does
and
i
think
that
maybe
another
problem
with
the
statute
that
there's
not
one
which
the
issue
in
this
case
address
but
i
think
it
certainly
--
i
think
it's
certainly
is
a
potential
problem.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no,
and
i
think
that
--
i
think
in
the
first
instance,
i
wouldn't
take
it
to
a
complete
extreme.
i
think
as
this
court
said
in
stanley
versus
illinois
that
the
constitution
recognizes
high
values
in
speed
and
efficiency.
i
think
you
have
to
be
reasonable
within
that
context
and
i
think
that
the
state
surely
has
an
interest
to
protect
but
i
think
in
the
point
i
made
earlier
is
that
i
think
that
a
state
has
to
strive
for
a
middle
ground
between
an
absolute
right
to
recover
on
the
part
of
these
fathers
and
an
absolute
exclusion
of
these
fathers
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
yes
sir,
to
satisfy
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
the
present
it
obviates
an
argument
made
by
the
appellee
and
that
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
avoiding
problems
with
proof
of
paternity.
i
think
this
case
and
cases
like
trimble
or
the
cases
which
make
it
clear
how
dangerous
it
is
to
engage
in
blanket
exclusion
because
in
this
case,
where
the
man
execute
the
birth
certificate,
i
think
he
obviously
would
have
carried
this
burden
of
proof.
i
think
that
state
certainly
entitled
to
exact
a
strict
standard
of
proof
on
the
father
in
these
cases
and
put
the
burden
only
in
like
washington
and
maryland
and
california
do.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor,
i
think
--
the
point
i
would
make
there
is
the
point
i
made
before
and
i'd
like
to
elaborate
on
it.
i
think
that
argument
assumes
a
level
of
awareness
about
the
necessity
of
legitimation
that
doesn't
exist.
and
when
i
say
that,
the
appellant
parham
would
be
very
surprised
to
find
that
he
had
to
do
anything
to
prove
to
the
world
that
this
was
his
child.
the
child
used
his
name
instead
of
the
mother's.
he
had
gone
for
them
the
day
of
the
child's
birth
and
executed
the
birth
certificate
acknowledging
the
world
that
it
was
his
child.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
your
honor.
i
think
given
the
degree
of
the
relationship
that
he
had
with
his
child
that
he
probably
expected
that
he
were
--
he
was
--
would
be
the
logical
alternative
to
the
child's
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
that
was
his
surprise.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
think
it
is
--
well,
i
think
it
is
addressed
to
both.
i
think
this
is
a
particularly
appropriate
case
because
the
relationship
had
existed
between
the
father
and
child
but
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
it
is
invalid
on
its
face
because
it
blanketly
excludes
him
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
don't
think
that
i
will
be
in
a
position
to
suggest
to
this
court,
to
the
state
or
to
more
carefully
tune
its
alternatives
if
i
wasn't
representing
a
client
who
would
be
within
those
carefully
tuned
alternatives
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
absolutely.
that
would
be--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
--
a
major
problem
you're
probably
subject
to
directed
verdict
for
damages
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
seven
years
old
at
the
time
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
--
of
his
death.
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
it
is
facially
unconstitutional
and
it's
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
appellant
parham.
i
--
yes
sir,
it
is
facially
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
gender-based
discrimination
i
think
is
--
requires
a
little
bit
of
separate
attention.
i
think
that
there
have
been
two
emerging
propositions
in
the
area
of
gender-based
discrimination,
both
of
which
i'm
comfortable
with
the
purposes
of
this
case,
warranty
is
that
that
the
classification
must
support
some
valid
governmental
objective
and
most
importantly,
it
must
be
substantially
related
to
the
promotion
of
that
objective
that
that
was
present
in
quilloin,
i
think.
the
asserted
state
interest
was
the
promotion
of
the
legitimate
family
relationships.
the
direct
result
to
this
court's
decision
in
quilloin
was
to
establish
a
legitimate
family
relationship
that
recognized
the
preferences
of
the
child
in
that
case,
it
recognized
an
existing
family
union.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
way
that
this
classification
which
penalizes
one
participant
and
--
to
the
illegitimate
act
and
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
begun
to
address
the
issue
of
gender-based
discrimination
in
the
present
case.
the
state
had
previously
there
appeared
to
be
two
emerging
propositions
in
the
area
of
gender-based
discrimination.
the
first
is
that
the
classification
must
support
a
valid
governmental
objective.
in
addition
it
must
be
substantially
related
to
the
promotion
of
that
objective.
i
think
the
present
classification
while
it
recognizes
a
valid
state
interest
that
is
the
promotion
of
legitimate
family
relationships
could
never
promote
that
legitimate
state
interest.
as
justice
douglas
said
in
glona,
it
is
preposterous
to
assume
that
people
would
give
birth
to
illegitimate
children
in
contemplation
of
the
fact
that
they
may
one
day
be
allowed
to
recover
for
the
wrongful
death.
as
this
court
stated
in
weber
versus
aetna
casualty,
it
is
illogical
to
assume
that
people
would
shun
illicit
relationships
for
fear
that
their
children
may
not
one
day
be
able
to
reap
the
benefits
of
a
workman's
compensation
law.
and
as
justice
hill
in
his
dissenting
opinion
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
stated,
the
sanction
employed
by
the
state
in
this
case
comes
too
late
to
have
possibly
promote
the
legitimate
state
interest.
so
i
think
it
fails
that
emerging
proposition
in
the
area
of
gender-based
discrimination.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor
i
think
you
more
nearly
approach
the
situation
of
trimble
versus
gordon
there
where
you
had
an
existing
family
unit.
in
that
situation,
it's
certainly
a
different
question
from
the
present
one.
i
think
it
would
be
very
unlikely
that
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
a
foster
father
and
a
natural
father,
both
having
meaningful
relationships
with
the
child.
i
think
this
court
has
traditionally
recognized
the
strong
interest
of
the
natural
parent
has
in
its
child
and
i
think
that
should
be
some
consideration.
the
second
emerging
proposition
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor,
as
i
said
before,
i
think
that
that
argument
is
dangerous
because
it
assumed
a
level
of
awareness
about
the
necessity
of
that
step.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
once
the
child
was
deceased
i
think
it
would
normally
in
an
action
where
there
is
apparently
clear
negligence
or
where
a
person
feels
another
person's
responsible.
well
i
think
it's
not
illogical
that
a
person
might
consider
that
he
might
be
entitled
to
recover
for
the
injury.
on
the
other
hand
in
a
situation
where
he
had
done
everything
he
knew
to
do,
to
indicate
to
the
public
and
the
world
that
the
child
was
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor,
the
record
establishes
that
he
had
executed
the
birth
certificate,
that
he
had
given
the
child
his
name,
that
he
had
supported
the
child,
most
of
the
acts
normally
associated
with
the
father-son
relationship.
and
beyond
that,
you
get
to
the
point
where
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
as
a
logical
hypothesis
in
the
present
case,
for
the
simple
reason,
--
i
mean
the
appellee
has
made
the
point
that
maybe
he'd
rather
do
support
because
there
were
criminal
sanctions
if
he
didn't.
well
if
that's
the
point
to
be
made
then
he
could
have
provided
a
minimal
level
of
support
and
avoided
the
criminal
sanctions
but
he
didn't
have
to
go
to
the
further
extreme
of
visiting
with
the
child
on
a
daily
basis
and
he
certainly
didn't
have
to
maintain
additional
charge
accounts
for
the
benefit
of
the
child
to
provide
as
additional
support.
i
think
its
good
faith
as
a
parent
has
been
demonstrated
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
deceased.
killed
in
the
same
accident
that
took
the
life
of
the
child.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
he
could've
filed
a
petition
for
legitimation.
he
could've
filed
a
petition
to
legitimate
the
child
without
marrying
the
child
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
there
is
a
procedure,
statutory
procedure
in
georgia
by
which
the
father
may
file
a
petition
to
legitimate
the
child
if
he
chooses.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
but
to
legitimate
the
child.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
--
yes,
your
honor.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
proposition
stated
by
the
court
in
trimble
and
in
stanley
that
this
equal
protection
question
should
be
decided
on
its
own
merits
and
not
in
regard
to
the
presence
or
the
absence
of
an
insurmountable
barrier,
still
the
proper
way
to
decide
the
case.
in
fact,
to
discuss
this
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor,
that
--
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
maintained
charged
accounts,
the
grocery
store
says.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
that
was
--
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
they
were
in
the
child's
name
and
that
he
maintained
charged
accounts
utilized
the
additional
support
of
the
child.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
sir,
they
did
not.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
sir,
your
honor.
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
she
was
married
to
someone.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
your
honor
that
is
the
final
point
that
i'd
hope
to
address
before
i
sit
down
and
that
gets
in
the
second
area
that
this
court,
the
term
that
this
court
has
talked
off,
that
is
the
area
of
engaging
an
overbroad
generalizations
with
regard
to
proclivities
and
tendencies
of
the
sex.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
think
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
statistical
indications
to
that
regard,
i
think
it
may
still
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
the
court
does
not
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
as
applied
to
this
appellant,
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
point
because
the
present
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
well
the
point
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
think
in
reality
your
honor
that
the
statistics
if
they
were
available
would
be
shocking.i
think
they
would
reveal
that
some
illegitimate
children
are
raised
by
their
mothers,
some
are
raised
by
collateral
relatives,
some
would
be
raised
by
grandparents,
some
would
be
raised
by
neighbors
and
friends.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
not
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
no,
i
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
in
the
first
instance,
i
think
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
legislature
or
the
supreme
court
had
at
its
disposal
any
statistics
even
approaching
that
regard.
i
think
the
statistics,
the
empirical
data
in
support
of
the
propositions
in
cases
like
califano
versus
goldfarb,
weinberger
versus
wiesenfeld
were
much
more
compelling
than
what's
been
offered
here.
all
that's
been
offered
here
is
legitimization
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
unsupported
by
any
statistics.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
conceded
that
a
statute
which
provided
for
an
effort
in
that
area
would
more
nearly
comport
with
reality
and
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
because
it
would
more
nearly
comport
with
reality
because
in
those
cases
where
he
could
not
prove
his
paternity
or
could
not
prove
a
contact
with
the
child
then
the
state
could
justifiably
exclude
him
from
participation.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
that
has
been
the
position
of
this
court.
as
i
understand
it,
administrative
convenience
is
not
sufficient
legitimate
state
interest
to
warrant
the
total
exclusion
of
a
child.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
think
the
court
may
be
the
one
that
would
be
confronted
with
that
question
in
an
area
of
legitimate
children
where
georgia
prefers
mothers
over
fathers
in
the
area
of
legitimate
children.
georgia
does
--
the
majority
of
the
states
allow
the
mother
and
the
father
to
share
in
that
recovery.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
if
he
could
prove
--
i
think
a
statute
like
maryland's
or
washington's
is
desirable
where
they
require
him
to
prove
more
than
the
fact
that
he's
the
father
that
he
needs
to
establish
his
paternity
and
a
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
all
of
the
facts
of
the
present
case,
i
think
that
would
be
the
constitutional
answer.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
under
georgia
law,
as
it
presently
exists
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
but
i
think
it
should
be
that
way
in
both
cases.
and
i
certainly
think
it
should
be
that
way
with
legitimate
children.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
yes
sir.
and
as
a
final
comment
before
i
conclude,
i
think
the
kind
of
generalizations
the
georgia
supreme
court
engaged
in
and
the
kind
that
this
court
has
traditionally
not
tolerated
the
generalizations
like
to
the
father
of
the
child
who
does
not
take
the
trouble
to
legitimate
the
child
suffers
no
real
loss
when
the
child
is
killed.
i
think
the
present
facts
illustrate
the
fallacy
of
that
argument.
the
overbroad
generalization
that
it
is
the
father
who
has
control
over
whether
a
legitimate
family
unit
will
exist,
that
almost
assumed
that
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
could
force
a
marriage
with
the
mother
if
he
wanted
to.
unlike
califano
and
other
cases
those
propositions
are
not
supported
statistically
in
any
regard
and
i
don't
think
they
can
justify
the
present
classification.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
if
i
may
be
permitted.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
counsel
for
appellee
makes
the
point
that
these
facts
may
be
subject
to
speculation
with
regards
with
relationship
between
the
father
and
child
because
they
were
only
documented
in
affidavit.
what
counsel
for
appellee
does
not
point
out
is
that
it
is
a
matter
of
record
in
this
court
now
that
that
affidavit
and
every
other
pleading
and
every
brief
that's
been
filed
in
this
case
was
served
on
the
maternal
grandmother
through
her
attorney
for
the
expressed
reasoning
of
giving
them
an
opportunity
to
contest
those
facts
if
there
were
any
--
if
they
existed
to
the
contrary.
there's
been
no
effort
to
intervene
in
these
proceedings,
although
under
georgia
law,
they
are
fully
entitled
to
do
so.
there's
been
no
response
in
the
affidavit,
no
response
in
the
brief
from
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
no
response
to
the
brief
in
this
court
and
they
were
served
with
all
those
documents.
appellee
asked
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
relying
on
quilloin
versus
walcott.
i
think
that
that
case
is
distinguishable
in
several
regards.
i
think
the
relationship
between
the
father
and
the
child
there
was
sporadic,
number
one.
number
two,
the
father
there
was
at
least
according
to
the
hearing,
the
state
properly
applied
the
best
interest
of
the
child
test
and
the
father
lost
in
that
hearing.
he
is
not
even
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
on
the
equal
protection
argument?
yes
your
honor,
i
think
it
does.
well
i
think,
the
whole
point
i
hate
to
be
redundant
is
that
i
think
the
failing
of
--
the
failure
of
the
state
of
georgia
is
the
failure
to
recognize
a
middle
ground
between
what
your
honor
talks
about
and
total
exclusion.
i
think
--
a
total
exclusion
by
absolute
right
to
recovery,
i
think
that's
the
failure.
i
think
the
court
in
quilloin
was
distinguishing
between
the
rights
of
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
and
of
the
--
of
a
divorced
father.
i
think
arguably
it
might
promote
the
objective
of
legitimate
family
relationships
there.
but
here
the
present
classification
distinguishes
between
two
participants
in
an
illegitimate
act
purportedly
to
discourage
that
illegitimate
act
and
i
fail
to
say
i
could
ever,
ever
promote
that
state
interest
to
this
service.
is
the
time
mean,
i'm
--
the
red
light
is
there,
okay.
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
i
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
the
--
mr.
thomas
e.
greer
there
was
the
implication
made
by
counsel
for
appellee
that
this
father
has
only
come
forward
when
there's
monetary
advantage
involved.
and
i
think
that's
another
overbroad
generalization.
it's
not
supported.
this
father
didn't
do
that.
he
was
a
father
to
this
child
from
the
beginning
to
the
end.
and
i
think
that
warrants
some
sort
of
deference
and
i
think
that's
been
the
message
of
this
court.
i
thank
the
court
for
the
privilege.
