you
know
that's
not
--
don't
you
have
to
only
answer
that
in
a
sex
discrimination
case
were
the
basis
of
review,
i
take
it
you
urge
in
somewhat
above
the
near
rationality
standard,
that
administrative
convenience
just
isn't
at
least
if
--
at
least
if
it's
not
much
very
burdensome
to
individualize
that
the
state
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
individualize.
justice

either
way,
it
could
be
the
same.
justice

what
would
the
--
what
could
the
recovery
be
for
in
a
estate?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
the
same
measure
as
might
be
available
to
a
mother?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
mother
--
suppose
both
parents
were
dead
and
but
there's
a
cause
of
action
available
to
the
estate
of
the
child
or
the
estate
of
the
mother,
is
that
it?
which
estate
are
you
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
isn't
--
so
the
major
damage
when
the
mother
is
suing
is
not
the
pecuniary
value
that
the
continued
life
of
the
child
might
mean
to
her.
justice

i
feel
the
legislature
got
busy.
