mr.
greer,
under
georgia
law,
the
unwed
father
could
legitimate
the
child
by
filing
a
petition
in
the
superior
court
in
the
county
in
which
the
child
was
born
i
think,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
in
trimble,
the
father
had
to
marry
the
mother.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say
in
trimble,
illinois
law
required
marriage
as
a
mode
of
legitimating.
and
that's
a
bit
more
serious
than
going
down
to
the
court
and
filing
a
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
you
had
a
mother
who
had
never
got
anything
for
the
child
from
the
day
of
birth
so
she
would
have
a
right
under
the
georgia
statute
to
bring
this
action,
wouldn't
she?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
greer,
before
--
following
up
on
one
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
questions
about
the
relationship,
supposing
that
the
legislature
had
made
a
study
of
the
problem
that
this
case
illustrates
and
found
that
in
about
94
and
95%
of
the
cases,
the
fathers
were
unknown
and
unidentified
and
about
5%
of
the
cases,
the
fathers
did
legitimate
the
child.
there
are
only
a
handful
of
cases
like
this
one
where
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
has
a
meaningful
relationship
with
the
child.
would
you
say
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
supposing
it's
overbroad
to
the
extent
that
2%
of
the
cases
that
are
subject
to
the
statute,
is
it
unconstitutional
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
--
this
is
the
only
case
that
this
situation
happens
and
is
it
still
unconstitutional?so
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
know
whether
that's
not
the
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
its
certainly
is
rather
unusual
for
the
mother
and
the
child
to
be
killed
in
the
same
accident
than
--
and
then
have
the
father
both
be
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
and
one
who
has
a
meaningful
relationship
with
the
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
really
don't
know,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
legislature
thought
they
were
at
--
the
case
was
with
the
one
i
described
for
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
legislature
assumed
perhaps
incorrectly
that
if
a
study
were
made
it
would
--
which
show
the
figures
i've
described,
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
would
the
statute
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
one
difference
and
that
is
you
in
effect
conceded
that
in
the
cases
where
the
father
was
unidentified
and
had
no
relationship
there
would
no
--
be
no
--
nothing
unconstitutional
about
denying
recovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
(inaudible)
that
it
makes
no
difference,
are
you
conceding
the
liability
to
someone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
miller,
did
--
but
mr.
greer
tell
us
that
the
georgia
law
requires
unwed
fathers
to
support
their
children
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
regardless?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
georgia
go
about
locating
them?
