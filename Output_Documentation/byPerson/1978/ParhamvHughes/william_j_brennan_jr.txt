brennan,

were
the
parents
living
together
or?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
greer,
let
me
ask
you
too,
there's
a
suggestion
that
a
cause
of
action
by
the
administratrix
is
pending,
is
that
still
pending?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
representing
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
haven't
--
you're
not
in
the
administrative's
lawsuit
in
any
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
that
being
held
up?
pending
disposition
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
agreed
that
that
--
that
the
administratrix
occupies
a
secondary
capacity
to
either
parent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
is
that
case
being
held
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
honor
that
is
an
argument
that
the
appellee
has
made.
i
have
--
i
think
it
absolutely
does
not
exist.
and
the
reason
that
i
say
it
does
not
exist
is
in
glona
versus
underwriters,
this
court
awarded
to
the
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child
a
right
to
recover
for
that
child's
death.
implicit
in
the
court's
decision
in
that
case
allowing
the
mother
to
recover
was
a
decision
that
other
collateral
relatives
or
other
people
in
the
statutory
scheme
would
not
be
entitled
to
recover.
the
same
is
true
in
levy
versus
louisiana.
they
complicit
in
that
court's
decision
that
the
children
could
recover
for
the
wrongful
of
the
mother
would
be
a
decision
that
she
would
be
entitled
to
recover
after
the
exclusion
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
father
had
not
taken
any
part
in
supporting
the
child?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
greer,
do
i
understand
the
colloquy
for
the
last
few
minutes
is
suggesting
that
your
argument
here
is
addressed
to
the
statute
as
applied
not
facially?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
don't
understand
why
you
answered
that
had
there
not
been
evidence
here
of
this
--
of
the
support
of
this
child,
you
would
not
have
tried
to
bring
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
want
to
understand
as
you
submit
it
has
two
questions
to
ask,
it
is
that
the
statute
is
facially
unconstitutional
in
the
equal
protection
clause,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
the
child
lived
with
the
mother?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
father
did
support
the
child.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
said
charged
accounts.
what
charged
accounts
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
child's
name?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
there
would
be
settlement
then
as
i
understand
you
either
with
the
administratrix
or
with
the
father
if
he
should
prevail
here.
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
this
is
your
approach.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
that
we
affirm,
is
georgia
law
clear
that
the
state
has
a
cause
of
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
there's
no
windfall
to
your
client.
