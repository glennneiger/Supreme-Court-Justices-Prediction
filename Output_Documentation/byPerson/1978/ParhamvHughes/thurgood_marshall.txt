mr.
miller,
are
you
--
some
kind
of
tell
me
why
that's
a
value
to
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
this
case
the
father
gave
his
own
name
to
the
boy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
the
way
the
record
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
state
didn't
have
any
trouble
then,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
wouldn't
need
them,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
did
the
necessity
going
to
this
petition
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
father
here
kept
the
birth
certificate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
affidavit,
it
said
that
the
father
was
the
one
who
went
to
obtain
the
birth
certificate.
isn't
that
what
this
record
shows?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
the
father
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
else
did
the
state
need
more
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
admits
it's
his
child.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
think
you
went
to
the
trouble
of
executing
that?
just
for
the
sake
of
a
writing
in
a
piece
of
paper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
