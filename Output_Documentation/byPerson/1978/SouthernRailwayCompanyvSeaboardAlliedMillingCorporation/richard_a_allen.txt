mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
urging
the
position
that
agrees
in
some
respects
and
disagrees
in
other
respects
with
both
sides
in
this
controversy.
first,
we
agree
with
the
commission
that
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
essentially
because
in
our
view
the
commission's
decision
was
not
a
final
decision
that
is
reviewable
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
because
the
complaining
shippers
had
not
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies.
in
that
respect,
we
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
with
the
complaining
shippers.
second,
however,
we
disagree
with
the
commission's
position
that
its
decision
not
to
conduct
an
investigation
under
section
15
is
never
judicially
reviewable.
we
submit
that
decision
may
be
judicially
reviewed
after
the
commission
has
made
a
final
decision
on
the
lawfulness
of
rates
under
a
section
13
proceeding
that
any
aggrieved
shipper
can
compel
the
commission
to
undertake
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
inevitable
that
you
decide
it
or
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
this
case.
perhaps
not
absolutely
necessary
but
in
order
to
determine
and
to
conclude
as
we
submit
you
should
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
there
are
two
alternative
theories
for
accepting
that.
the
first
theory
is
the
commission's
theory
that
this
is
simply
one
of
those
kind
of
agency
actions
that
is
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law
and
therefore
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
wholly
immune
from
judicial
review
at
anytime.
the
other
position
is
our
position
which
is
quite
different
which
is
that
it
is
not
one
of
those
kind
of
actions
but
rather
the
court
of
appeals
lack
jurisdiction
on
finality
principles
and
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
our
position
is
based
on
our
view
that
under
the
particular
scheme
by
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
principle
consequence
that
a
commission's
decision
not
to
conduct
an
investigation
under
section
15
is
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
question
of
the
lawfulness
of
rates
from
carriers
wold
be
under
section
15
to
shippers
where
it
would
be
under
section
13.
that
consequence
is
expressly
provided
for
by
in
the
act
and
it's
an
important
aspect
of
the
scheme
of
the
act.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
decisions.
if
the
commission
conducts
and
decides
to
conduct
an
investigation
under
section
15,
that
section
expressly
provides
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
carrier
to
show
that
the
proposed
change
in
rates
is
just
and
reasonable.
if
the
commission
does
not
investigate
under
section
15,
any
aggrieved
shipper
can
file
a
complaint
under
section
13
and
compel
a
commission
to
adjudicate
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
but
in
that
case,
the
burden
is
on
the
complaining
shipper
to
show
that
the
rates
are
unlawful.
i'd
like
to
take
briefly
our
reasons
for
agreeing
with
the
commission
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
reviewing
this
case
and
devote
the
preponderance
of
my
time
to
the
point
in
which
we
disagree
with
the
commission.
the
commission's
decision
not
to
investigate
under
section
15
was
not
reviewable
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
view
because
it
was
not
a
final
decision
within
the
meaning
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
within
the
meaning
of
28
united
states
code
section
23425
which
gives
the
courts
of
appeals
jurisdiction
to
review
final
orders
of
the
commission.
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
commission's
decision
not
to
investigate
under
section
15
did
not
constitute
or
expressly
or
in
effect
a
determination
on
the
lawfulness
of
the
proposed
rate
changed.
the
statute
gives
shippers
an
adequate
remedy
in
section
13
to
compel
the
commission
to
decide
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
principles
of
exhaustion
administrative
remedies
require
shippers
to
use
and
employ
that
procedure
before
they
can
invoke
judicial
review.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
do
not
because
we
do
perceive
a
distinction
between
the
review
of
a
decision
not
to
investigate
and
a
review
of
a
decision
not
to
suspend
the
rate.
in
arrow
and
scrap,
the
court
explained
that
decision
of
the
commission
not
to
suspend
a
rate
were
not
reviewable
but
for
very
particular
and
persuasive
reasons
that
were
evident
in
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
congress
had
not
intended
to
be
reviewable
because
the
suspension
power
itself
was
enacted
to
prevent
the
practice
that
it
previously
occurred
of
district
courts
in
joining
rates
and
therefore
creating
a
great
disparity
in
rates
contrary
to
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
we
believe
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist
as
mr.
evans
explained.
the
this
--
they
--
the
power
to
investigate
is
not
necessarily
a
power
preliminary
to
a
decision
to
investigate.
it
is
a
power
that
is
exercised
at
the
same
time
or
even
independently.
the
commission
can
refuse
to
suspend
the
rate
and
nevertheless,
investigate
its
lawfulness
under
section
15
in
which
the
carriers
have
the
burden
of
proof.
it
can
suspend
the
rate
and
still
investigate
under
section
15.
it
doesn't
conduct
the
investigation
before
it
decides
whether
to
suspend
or
not
to
suspend.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
perha
--
perhaps
analogous.
perhaps
analogous.
there
are
circumstances
as
i
will
explain
in
a
minute
in
which
they
can
be
easily
imagine
and
not
extremely
farfetched
in
which
the
commission's
decision
not
to
conduct
an
investigation
would
be,
we
think
plainly
contrary
to
the
statute
or
plainly
arbitrary
and
capricious.
we've
given
some
examples
in
our
brief
but
for
the
present,
let
me
outline
the
precise
reasons
that
we
disagree
with
the
commission's
position.
as
i
said,
we
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
in
this
case
now.
but
the
commission
goes
further
and
contends
that
its
decision
not
to
investigate
is
never
subject
to
judicial
review
even
after
a
final
decision
by
the
commission
on
the
merits
of
the
lawfulness
of
rates
because
in
the
commission's
view,
the
decision
not
to
investigate
is
one
of
those
actions
which
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law
and
therefore
wholly
unreviewable.
according
to
the
logic
of
the
commission's
position,
therefore
it
believes
that
its
discretion
not
to
investigate
is
analogous
to
the
discretion
of
the
public
prosecutor
not
to
investigate
or
prosecute
someone
for
violations
of
criminal
law.
with
that
proposition,
we
strongly
disagree.
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
two
points
in
connection
with
our
disagreement.
the
first
is
that
we
believe
that
the
commission's
position
is
contrary
to
general
and
important
principles
that
this
court
has
established
determining
the
availability
of
judicial
review
of
administrative
action.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
while
it
may
be
that
there
is
not,
that
there
will
not
be
a
practical
difference
or
that
there
will
be
little
practical
difference
between
our
position
and
the
commission's
position
in
most
cases.
there
may
be
some
cases
in
which
it
is
of
significant
practical
consequence.
and
we
believe
that
an
example
of
the
kind
of
case
where
it
may
make
a
difference
has
already
been
before
this
court
in
the
atchison,
topeka,
and
santa
fe
railway
case
versus
wichita
board
of
trade
case
in
412
u.s.
discussed
in
our
brief
at
pages
35
to
37?
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
this
court
has
established
and
stated
in
many
cases
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
establishes
a
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
judicial
review
of
administrative
action
and
there
are
only
two
circumstances
in
which
review
can
be
precluded.
first,
where
a
statute
expressly
precludes
review
or
second,
where
the
statutory
scheme
provides
some
particular
and
persuasive
reason
why
review
would
not
be
appropriate.
in
this
case,
so
long
as
review
is
deferred
until
after
a
commission
decision
under
merits
of
rates
under
section
13
which
is
reviewable
in
a
court
in
any
event.
there
is
nothing
in
the
scheme
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
would
indicate
that
review
of
the
no
investigation
decision
was
--
is
inappropriate.
and
the
commission
is
cited
nothing
in
the
purposes
or
procedures
of
the
act
that
would
be
undermined
by
review
of
a
no
investigation
decision
in
the
context
of
the
normal
judicial
review
of
final
commission
decisions.
accordingly,
we
think
that
rejection
of
the
commission's
position
is
important
as
a
matter
of
general
principles.
in
respect
to
my
second
point,
there
may
be
as
i've
said
little
practical
difference
between
our
position
and
the
commission's
in
most
cases.
we
believe
that
we
think
that
the
commission's
discretion
in
this
matter
is
quite
broad
although
not
unlimited.
and
it
may
be
--
there
may
be
and
probably
are
very
few
cases
in
which
a
court
could
ultimately
find
that
the
commission
had
abused
its
discretion
in
not
investigating
a
rate.
and
yet
in
which
at
the
same
time
the
commission
in
a
section
13
proceeding
found
that
the
complaining
shippers
had
not
met
their
burden
of
selling
that
the
rates
were
unlawful.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
you
do
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
this
court
has
equated
action
and
non-action
in
the
past.
i
think
the
chicago
board
of
trade
case
can
be
viewed
as
an
example
of
that.
but
in
any
event,
there's
no
principle
which
i
can
perceive
for
saying
that
action
and
non-action
are
different
in
terms
of
judicial
reviewability.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
not
in
this
text.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
a
sense,
i
suppose
that
is
true
although
it
is
very
farfetched
and
unrealistic.
a
case
in
which
it
might
be
that
a
section
13
proceeding
was
initiated
years
after
the
commission
that
decline
to
investigate
the
tariff
over
the
protest
of
complaining
shippers.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
--
in
probably
in
most
cases
but
it
is
by
no
means
farfetched
to
imagine
cases
in
which
it
might
be
a
practical
significance.
we
have
given
examples
in
our
brief,
hypotheticals
where
the
commission
fails
to
investigate
for
solely
and
for
manifestly
erroneous
legal
reasons.
so
because
for
example
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
i
think
the
court
could
do
that.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
that
question.
we
would
be
perfectly
happy
with
the
decision
that
says
whatever
the
ultimate
reviewability
it
is
not
final
at
this
time.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
whether
or
not
that
would
be
appropriate
is
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
administration
is
more
of
your
question
than
mine.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
certainly
that's
true
mr.
chief
justice.
my
last
point
though
is
that
it
is
not
farfetched
to
imagine
such
cases
and
in
our
view,
a
good
example
is
that
situation
that
it
has
already
confronted
this
court
in
the
wichita
board
of
trade
case.
and
although
the
posture
of
that
case
was
somewhat
different,
we
think
that
it
does
stand
in
principle
for
the
proposition
that
we
support
namely
that
no
investigation
decisions
are
subject
to
judicial
review
for
an
abuse
of
discretion.
we
have
discussed
that
case
in
our
brief
and
i
rely
on
the
discussion
unless
there
are
any
questions
from
the
court.
thank
you
very
much.
