mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
they
present
a
discrete
issue
of
reviewability.
are
the
courts
empowered
to
review
an
icc
decision
not
to
investigate
a
proposed
railroad
rate
change
before
the
change
takes
effect?
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
such
a
decision
is
reviewable
and
we
argued
that
it
is
not.
the
case
started
in
august
1977
when
the
southern
railroads
filed
tariffs
proposing
a
20%
seasonal
increase
on
the
rates
for
the
transportation
of
grain
in
the
southern
territory.
the
tariff
was
to
last
for
three
months
and
it
was
among
the
first
of
the
tariffs
filed
under
the
1976
legislation
which
directed
the
commission
to
allow
the
filing
of
such
demand
sensitive
rates.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
give
shippers
an
incentive
to
reduce
peak
period
transportation
and
to
better
use
the
national
car
pool
of
railroad
freight
cars.
several
groups
of
shippers
including
the
respondents
here
filed
protest
with
the
commission
arguing
that
the
increase
has
violated
a
variety
of
sections
of
the
act
and
they
asked
the
commission
to
suspend
and
investigate
the
rates
under
section
15.
the
commission
decided
not
to
suspend
or
investigate
essentially
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
was
not
convinced
that
the
shippers
had
made
convincing
arguments
on
the
merits
of
their
claims
of
unlawfulness,
and
second,
because
the
commission
wanted
to
carry
out
the
congressional
policy
of
creating
a
regulatory
climate
that
would
be
conducive
to
this
kind
of
experimentation
in
railroad
ratemaking.
the
shippers
filed
a
petition
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
they
sought
and
we
got
a
stay
from
the
court
for
approximately
eight
days
which
enjoined
the
railroads
from
collecting
the
rates
during
that
period.
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
review
the
commission's
decision
not
suspend
the
rates
but
it
held
that
it
could
review
the
decision
not
to
investigate
the
rates.
a
decision
that
is
characterized
as
a
termination
of
an
investigation
into
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates,
court
of
appeals
reasoned
that
shippers
--
the
shippers
had
made
substantial
allegations
that
the
tariffs
were
patently
unlawful
that
the
commission
had
a
duty
to
investigate
and
that
it's
what
it
referred
to
as
a
premature
termination
of
the
investigation
was
improper.
the
decision
was
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
had
held
unreviewable,
a
commission
decision
not
to
investigate
under
section
15
of
the
act.
the
key
to
the
case,
i
believe
is
in
the
structure
of
the
acts,
rate
investigation
and
complaint
procedures.
there
are
two
ways
that
the
commission
can
investigate
a
railroad
rate.
under
section
15,
it
has
the
power
before
the
effectiveness
of
the
rate
to
institute
an
investigation
and
during
that
period
to
suspend
the
rate
for
up
to
seven
or
ten
months
depending
on
whether
it
seeks
an
extension
of
time
pending
the
completion
of
the
investigation.
if
it
decides
against
instituting
a
section
15
investigation,
anyone
can
complain
under
section
13
and
the
commission
must
investigate
in
response
to
their
complaint.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
must
investigate,
it
must
begin
a
proceeding.
it
is
an
effect
an
adjudicator
of
the
proceeding,
basically,
a
dispute
between
the
complaining
party
on
the
one
hand
and
the
carrier
on
the
other.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
think
it's
more
the
former.
it
does
not
necessarily
actively
participate
in
the
investigation
by
the
same
token
of
course
has
the
power
to
develop
the
record
if
the
record
is
not
being
adequately
developed.
but
investigation
is
a
term
that
was
used
in
the
original
act.
it
really,
in
the
recodification,
it's
been
changed
to
the
word
proceeding.
it's
a
proceeding
before
the
agency.
and
it
can
be
instituted
either
on
its
motion
in
which
case
there
may
not
be
complaining
party
in
which
case
it
would
developed
the
record
or
could
be
instituted
in
response
to
a
complaint.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
essentially
the
same,
there
are
several
procedural
differences.
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
some
issues
is
on
the
carrier
in
a
section
15
case.
that
is
the
one
that
would
be
instituted
in
advance
of
the
rates
effectiveness.
on
the
question
of
whether
the
rates
are
reasonable
are
these,
are
they
high
enough
or
too
high.
the
carrier
their
bears
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
evidence.
as
to
other
issues,
the
burden
remains
the
same.
in
either
proceeding,
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
an
initial
showing
on
question
such
as
discrimination
or
violations
of
the
long
and
short
whole
clause
which
are
the
issues
that
we
have
in
this
case
rest
with
the
shippers.
there
are
some
differences
in
the
result
of
the
proceeding.
in
a
section
15
proceeding,
the
commission
may
order
refunds
if
it
finds
that
the
rates
are
unjustified.
in
a
section
13
proceeding,
the
result
is
damages
in
favor
of
the
shipper
if
he
can
demonstrate
that
he's
been
financially
injured
by
the
unlawful
rate.
and
they
are
slightly
different
statutory
time
limits
that
govern
the
proceedings
under
section
15.
the
commission
is
under
an
obligation
to
complete
the
proceeding
in
seven
months
with
a
possible
three-month
extension.
there's
not
that
same
statutory
limit
in
a
section
13
proceeding
but
there
are
some
internal
some
procedural
limits
within
the
proceeding
itself.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
refers
to
the
examination
made
after
the
suspension
or
after
the
decision
to
investigate.
that's
critical
to
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
mentioned
characterized
what
the
commission
did
here
as
a
premature
termination
of
an
investigation.
the
term
investigation
is
used
in
the
statute,
the
statutes
that
we
codify
the
word
is
now
proceeding.
what
it
means
is
the
process
that
can
lead
to
a
final
judgment
on
the
--
or
final
order
of
the
commission
adjudicating
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
quite
the
reversed
mr.
justice
is
if
it
in
order
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i'm
sorry.
well,
in
a
--
the
decision
whether
to
investigate
and
suspend
is
simultaneous.
a
rate
is
filed.
it
is
up
to
the
commission
in
response
to
protest
to
decide
whether
first
of
all
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
the
rate.
if
it
decides
that
it
will
investigate
at
that
stage
for
the
rates
effectiveness,
it
may
but
need
not
also
suspend
the
effectiveness
of
the
rates
for
up
to
seven
months.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
maybe
i'm
not
being
clear.
the
suspension
happens
at
the
outset.
a
suspension
is
basically
an
injunction,
temporary
injunction.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pending
a
final
decision.
the
final
decision
is
the
result
of
the
investigation.
the
suspension
carries
with
the
investigation
and
terminates
the
end
of
the
investigation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
it's
a
very
rapid
necessary
so,
very
rapid
decision
at
the
administrative
stage.
the
rates
come
in,
tariffs
cannot,
brought
along
some
tariffs
just
you
could
see
what
we're
talking
about.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
protest
come
in
with
--
the
tariffs
have
to
followed
with
at
least
30
days
notice.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
a
tariff
comes
in,
it
is
--
protest
must
be
in
under
the
rules
by
12
days
before
the
effective
date.
the
carrier
can
reply
to
the
protest
by
the
fourth
working
day
before
the
effectiveness
of
the
rate.
by
the
third
working
day,
before
the
effectiveness
of
the
rate,
the
commission's
suspension
board
makes
a
judgment
whether
it
will
investigate
and
suspend
or
investigate
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there's
an
appraisal.
it's
a
very
rapid
informal
assessment
(voice
overlap)
absolutely.
it
is
not
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
an
investigation
is
that
phrase
it's
used
within
the
statute.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i'm
not
making
this
clear,
i
guess
but
the
decision
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
it
is
possible
for
the
commission
to
investigate
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
without
suspending.
it
cannot
suspend
without
investigating.
in
other
words,
the
suspension
--
purpose
of
the
suspension
is
much
like
a
preliminary
injunction.
you're
holding
the
rain
off
while
you're
investigating.
if
you
have
an
investigation,
there's
no
reason
to
suspend.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there's
no
foundation
for
a
suspension.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
without
suspension,
precisely.
it's
the
same
investigation.
it's
just
that
one
case,
the
commission
feels
it
necessary
to
hold
the
rate
from
being
effective
and
the
other
case
it's
will
and
when
it
come
to
effect.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
even
broader,
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
no
statutory
standards
that
govern
the
exercise
of
the
suspension
and
investigation
authority.
the
statute
is
simply
the
commission
may
investigate
and
may
suspend.
there
are
very
clear
statutory
standards
that
come
into
play
in
response
to
a
section
13
complaint.
there
the
commission
must
investigate
it.
it
has
no
discretion
unless
it
finds
that
the
complaint
is
completely
without
substance.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
in
effect,
that's
right.
a
--a
shipper
who
seeks
unsuccessfully
to
have
her
rate
investigated
at
the
outset
can
just
turn
around
the
next
day
and
file
a
complaint
and
secured
investigation,
they
compel
it,
they
can
compel
it.
what
the
respondents
in
this
case
did
was
go
to
court.
they
could
have
simply
filed
the
complaint
with
the
commission
the
next
day
and
the
investigation
probably
would
be
over
by
now.
the
commission's
discretion
at
that
stage
is
even
broader
than
a
court.
this
is
not
limited
to
questions
of
likely
harm
and
so
forth.
that
is
clearly
part
of
the
suspension
board's
consideration.
it
considers
questions
like,
is
it
likely
that
this
rate
is
going
to
be
found
unlawful?
is
it
likely
that
the
public
is
going
to
be
significantly
harmed?
but
it
also
takes
into
account
things
like
the
availability
of
commission
resources
for
the
investigation.
and
it
takes
it
to
account
things
like
the
overriding
congressional
policy
that
the
commission
found
decisive
here.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it's
a
little
bit
narrower
than
that
mr.
justice,
its
--
the
burden
is
on
the
carrier
to
demonstrate
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
now,
there
are
other
issues
embraced
within
the
phrase
lawfulness.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
in
the
section
15,
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
the
remedy
normally
is
refunds.
in
fact,
the
statute
requires
refunds.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
if
the
commission
finds
that
the
rates
were
unjustified,
now
that
doesn't
always
happen.
sometimes
the
commission
can
find
that
the
rates
were
not
lawfully,
were
not
shown
to
be
just
reasonable
or
not
shown
to
be
lawful.
in
which
case,
the
remedy
might
not
be
refunds.
but
refunds
are
unavailable
remedy.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
went
wrong
i
believe
for
basically
three
reasons.
first,
we
discussed
that
it
characterized
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
as
a
termination
of
investigation.
in
fact,
the
investigation
was
never
begun.
that's
critical
because
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
city
of
chicago
case,
that
distinction
was
of
the
size
of
significance.
the
court
held
there
that
a
commission
decision
terminating
an
investigation
of
a
--
the
lawfulness
of
train
discontinuance
was
reviewable
because
it
was
a
decision
on
the
merits
just
like
any
other
decision
on
the
merits.
the
same
time
it
stated
in
that
case
the
corollary
principle
that
the
commission
need
not
institute
the
investigation.
that
matter
according
to
court
was
a
matter
committed
to
the
agency's
discretion
and
not
reviewable.
the
second
error,
the
court
made
was
that
it
seemed
to
think
that
section
13
complaint
procedures
under
section
13
would
not
be
available
for
certain
categories
of
claims.
that's
just
not
the
case.
any
issue
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
can
be
raised
in
the
section
13
complaint
just
as
it
could
in
the
section
15
proceeding.
and
finally,
it
believed
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
not
to
investigate
was
tantamount
to
a
finding
that
the
rates
were
lawful
and
that's
not
the
case.
this
court
held
as
much
in
the
first
scrap
decision,
a
refusal
to
investigate
leaves
the
rates
fully
subject
to
complaint
investigation.
it
forecloses
no
argument
as
to
the
lawfulness.
i
began
to
point
to
these
tariffs
i
brought
along
here
that
illustrate
the
kind
of
thing
the
commission
deals
with.
i
asked
the
tariff
people
to
give
me
a
sampling,
a
big
one,
a
medium
one,
and
a
little
one.
that
is
a
one
tariff,
that's
about
average
i'm
told,
the
middle
one,
that's
a
small
one.
the
commission
receives
52,000
of
this
a
year
roughly
and
it
considers
for
suspension
and
investigation
in
response
to
protest
for
a
smaller
number.
but
even
so,
there
are
a
within
each
tariff
maybe
one
or
two
but
as
many
as
thousands
of
individuals
rate
changes,
this
is
a
mammoth
undertaking.
the
commission
examines
all
the
tariffs
that
it
receives
and
when
it
receives
protest,
it
considers
the
issues
of
lawfulness
of
the
raise.
but
these
are
the
kinds
of
judgments
that
are
being
made
rapidly
in
the
face
of
the
day
after
getting
the
railroads
reply.
they're
the
kind
of
judgments
that
are
made
basically
from
gut
because
it's
just
impossible
to
deal
with
more
effectively
in
that
stage
than
from
the
gut.
and
in
our
view,
that's
not
the
kind
of
decision
the
courts
are
very
well-equipped
to
undertake
review
of.
there
are
a
number
of
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
the
department
of
justice
argued
there
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
was
reviewable
then.
right
there
in
that
court.
in
fact,
the
--
much
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
a
reflection
of
the
brief
that
was
submitted
by
the
department
of
justice
in
that
case.
we
have
been
consistent.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
quite
different,
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
hesitate
to
embrace
the
adjective
but
it
certainly
has
appeal.
i
just
want
to
make
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pardon
me?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
i
have
a
few
others.
the
one
i
used
was
curiously
cumbersome.
i
just
want
to
make
one
other
point,
that
is
if
the
respondent's
arguments
here
really
hinged
on
a
notion
that
these
rates
are
patently
obviously
ridiculously
unlawful
and
their
whole
argument
hinges
on
the
court's
willingness
to
make
that
finding.
it's
really
trying
to
drag
--
they're
really
trying
to
drag
this
court
into
the
merits
of
this
case
even
before
they've
given
the
commission
an
opportunity
to
address
those
merits
finally.
there
is
doubt
about
the
lawfulness
notwithstanding
what
they
will
tell
you
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
court
need
not
enter
the
matter
until
the
commission
has
spoken.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
thank
you.
both
mr.
caldwell
and
mr.
spencer
have
argued
that
the
commission
is
required
to
suspend
these
rates
to
stop
them
from
taking
effect.
the
argument
that
before
the
court
of
appeals
made
did
not
prevail.
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
only
that
the
commission
must
investigate
it.
did
not
hold,
did
not
order,
the
commission
take
the
steps
that
the
respondents
here
asked
for.
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
the
question
of
the
reviewability
the
suspension
order
they
failed
across
petition
in
our
view
the
issue,
the
argument
that
they
make
are
simply
impermissible
at
this
stage.
beyond
that
it's
simply
not
the
case
that
the
issues
that
were
raised
by
the
shippers
in
this
case
could
be
intuited
on
the
face
of
the
papers
before
the
commission.
what
was
filed
were
supplements
to
very
large
tariffs,
i'm
told
not
quite
large
as
the
big
one
but
almost
as
large
as
the
big
one
with
thousands
of
individual
rates
dealing
with
thousands
of
points
in
the
southern
territory.
the
supplements
themselves
were
relatively
small
but
they
converted
all
the
rates
in
the
broader
tariffs
into
20%
larger
numbers.
the
allegations
of
fourth
section
violations
that
is
long
and
short
haul
violations
were
presented
by
the
shippers
in
their
protest
filed
three
weeks
after
the
tariffs
themselves
were
filed
an
allegation
was
made
that
the
tariffs
these
thousands
of
rates
reflected
hundreds
of
violations.
they
cited
one
example,
that
one
example
respondents
have
now
admitted
on
briefs
was
an
error.
two
days
before
the
effective
date,
they
submitted
the
supplementary
petition
attaching
five
more
examples
again
saying
that
these
are
just
exemplary
pervasive
violations.
well,
the
commission
has
limited
resources
itself.
the
shippers
who
were
most
effective
were
able
to
dig
up
a
total
of
six
one
of
which
was
wrong
in
a
period
up
to
the
second
day
before
the
effective
date.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
the
commission
could.
i
don't
think
the
commission
would.
in
our
view,
there's
no
requirement
that
a
rate
of
the
commission.
but
even
the
rate
of
the
commission
believes
is
clearly
likely
to
be
unclear
to
be
unlawful.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
i
do.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
indeed.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
sure.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
where
the
commission
has
suspended
a
rate
that
it
has
no
authority
to
suspend
or
at
least
the
allegations
that
it
has
not
authority
to
suspend.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
say
it's
different
if
the
allegation
goes
to
the
commission's
exercise
of
the
suspension
discretion
and
acknowledge
discretion.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
i
think
that
arguably
is
a
reviewable
issue.
so
long
as
the
remedy
sought
is
not
a
direction
to
suspend
or
direction
to
investigate,
or
direction
to
exercise
discretion.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
so.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
the
commission
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
sir.
the
commission
in
my
judgment
does
not
have
an
obligation
to
suspend
even
in
the
face
of
tariffs
that
it
finds
are
apparently
unlawful.
it
ordinarily
will
take
action
of
that
sort
but
is
not
required
to
do
so.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
and
the
argument
that
the
analogous
argument
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
if
the
argument
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
that
the
commission
refused
has
declined
to
consider
whether
to
suspend.
if
it
has
refused
to
exercise
a
discretion
it
lawfully
has
i
think
that
the
court
may
review
the
refusal
to
exercise
the
discretion
and
an
order
of
the
commission
to
exercise
its
discretion.
that
is
the
analogy
to
the
taps
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
the
allegation.
it
did
not
fails
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
expected,
it
could
be
argued
that
it's
not
but
the
point
is
it
is
not
even
before
the
court.
the
that
--
the
argument
was
made
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
was
not
accepted
by
the
eighth
circuit.
the
eighth
circuit
held
only
that
the
commission
was
required
to
investigate
and
order
the
investigation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
of
the
respondents
have
been
making
is
that
these
tariffs
were
facially
unlawful.
the
commission
had
no
alternative
but
to
stop
them
from
taking
effect.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
correct.
what
the
commission
was
faced
with
here
were
tariffs
that
were
--
it
was
not
even
clear
to
the
commission
on
the
face
of
it
that
this
were
not
plainly
paper
rates.
it's
not
clear
to
these
shippers;
in
fact
they've
never
really
alleged
that
they're
going
to
be
hurt
by
these
rates.
it's
an
ideal
occasion
for
remitting
shippers
to
their
section
13
remedies
which
are
available
for
someone
who's
actually
injured.
i
want
to
correct
one
other
point
and
that
is
that
the
section
13
remedy
is
available
and
the
commission's
precedent
so
hold
to
raise
and
adjudicate
section
4
issues.
and
if
a
violation
of
section
4
is
found
in
a
section
13
complaint
proceeding,
damages
are
available.
the
measure
of
damages
may
draw
upon
concepts
of
reasonableness
and
discrimination
but
damages
are
available
even
if
the
only
violation
is
alleged
in
the
section
4
violation.
our
reply
brief
points
that
out.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it's
--
it's
ambiguous,
quite
frankly.
i've
read
it
a
number
of
different
ways,
a
number
of
different
times.
i
think
it
can
be
read
either
way.
the
court's
emphasis
throughout
its
opinion
is
on
the
alleged
violations
of
section
4
but
it
also
speculates
towards
the
end
of
its
opinion
that
there
may
also
be
a
problem
with
sections
2
and
3
involving
private
cars
and
railroad
cars
that
mr.
spencer
alluded
to.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
commission
has
not
determined
it.
i
don't
have
a
position
on
it.
it's
simply
not
been
resolved.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
commission
can
--
yes,
the
commission
can
make
a
judgment
whether
it
agrees
that
they
are
patently
unlawful
and
even
so
whether
it
needs
to
take
the
action
that
the
respondents
have
asked
for.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
what
in
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
commission
did
not
ignore
these
violations,
these
alleged
violations.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
has
not
resolved
it
but
it
alluded
to
the
fact
that
there
were
alleged
section
4
violations.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
allegations
were
that
they
were
patent.
so
commission
obviously
didn't
see
it
that
way.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
dont
think
the
language
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
