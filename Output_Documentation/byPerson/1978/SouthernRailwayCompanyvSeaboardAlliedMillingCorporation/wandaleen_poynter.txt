ms.
wandaleen
poynter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
representative
of
the
railroads,
i
would
like
to
approach
essentially
and
very
emphatically
the
overriding
public
policy
problems
as
well
as
the
congressional
mandate
avoidance
problems,
if
you
will
that
we
will
face
if
and
i
do
without
completely
the
position
that
the
commission
has
taken
in
this
regard
that
the
court
below
has
simply
intruded,
it
is
a
classic
example
of
an
intrusion
into
an
administrative
proceeding.
they
absolutely
took
this
case,
they
entered
a
suspension
as
only
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
do
under
15
(8)
and
as
this
court
has
held
emphatically,
a
completely
a
part
from
court
interference.
they
then
proceeded
to
take
every
step
available
under
section
15
(8)
to
the
commission.
they
made
a
determination
in
light
of
the
evidence.
they
issued
a
refund
order
and
they
then
proceeded
to
set
an
investigation.
they
literally
remanded
to
the
commission
and
said
to
the
commission
you
will
investigate
and
you
will
make
findings
on
two
specific
areas.
in
1976,
congress
passed
the
railroad
revitalization
and
regulatory
reformat
and
within
that
as
the
commission
has
indicated
were
provisions
which
drastically
changed
the
rate
making
regulation
allowed
to
the
commission
and
in
most
instances
definitely
decrease
the
authority
that
the
commission
had
to
step
in
especially
at
pre-effective
stage
to
literally
interfere
with
railroad
made
rates.
carrier
initiation
of
rates
isn't
absolute.
there
is
only
the
suspension
stage
which
interferes
with
carrier
initiation
of
rights.
one
of
the
provisions
was
the
provision
allowing
the
publication
of
demand
sensitive
rates.
the
allegations
which
have
been
made
of
patent
illegalities
by
the
protestants
were
desperate
attempts
literally,
11th
hour
attempts
on
part
of
one
of
the
protestants
simply
to
get
before
a
court
to
avoid
the
restrictions
that
have
been
placed
by
congress
within
15
(a)
including
and
i
address
the
question
which
was
initially
requested
of
mr.
evans.
the
suspension
state
is
more
like
a
petition
for
a
stay
to
a
court.
at
this
particular
time
and
it
was
prior
to
february
of
1976
because
indeed
now
a
complainant
to
the
commission
requesting
that
a
rate
be
suspended
or
investigated
or
both
must
show
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
substantial
harm
and
that
there
is
a
likelihood
that
the
complainant
will
prevail
on
the
merits.
neither
the
complainants
represented
before
this
court
today
did
that.
in
seeking
appeal
to
the
eighth
circuit,
the
complainants
in
essence
avoided
their
recourse
through
the
commission
and
mislead
the
court
in
a
sense
by
requesting
suspension
on
patent
illegalities
when
it
had
not
been
proved
to
the
commission.
the
court
below
misconstrued
what
the
complainants
were
saying
to
the
court
and
that
is
where
we
find
ourselves
today
before
this
court.
if
the
lower
court
decision
is
not
reversed,
it
literally
will
open
floodgates
to
allow
shippers
to
avoid
the
restrictions
that
have
not
been
placed
against
them
by
congress
by
allowing
is
equivalent
to
a
pre-1910
situation
where
the
courts
will
be
telling
the
commission
when
they
will
and
when
then
they
will
not
investigate
and
at
what
time.
the
most
compelling
example
of
this
is
the
position
represented
to
this
court
today
by
the
chicago
board
of
trade
and
its
co-respondent
parties.
they
have
simply
alleged
simple
violations
of
two
sections
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
deal
with
discriminatory
or
prejudicial
practices,
most
definitely,
areas
with
which
only
the
commission
is
qualified
to
act.
if
the
lower
court
decision
is
upheld,
it
will
only
be
necessary
for
a
complainant
to
go
before
the
commission
and
to
make
any
allegation
of
patent
illegality
and
then
put
that
before
in
appeals
court
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
they
have
raised
a
substantial
question
or
not,
not
to
allow
the
commission
to
make
that
determination.
