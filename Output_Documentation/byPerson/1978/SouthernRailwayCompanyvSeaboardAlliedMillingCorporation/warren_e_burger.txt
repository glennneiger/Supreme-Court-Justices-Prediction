whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
you
might
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
you
analogize
it
to
an
injunction,
is
it
the
same,
broadly
the
same
kind
of
discretion
to
be
exercised
by
the
board
as
a
court
would
--
of
equity
would
exercise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
that
the
discretion
is
broader
in
part
because
they
have
absolutely
feel
a
safe
way
of
protecting
everybody?

it
inevitable
that
we
must
decided
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

is
something
in
nature
of
at
least
to
analogous
to
probable
cause
and
the
--
that
enters
into
their
thinking

that
stage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
to
equate
action
and
non-action
to
sustain
your
position,
don't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
just
have
to
put
you
foot
in
the
door
for
future's
development.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
even
if
your
foot
isn't
in

door,
you'd
like
to
have
the
door
left
open.
chief

well.
mr.

chief

emphasis
on
the
limited
order
