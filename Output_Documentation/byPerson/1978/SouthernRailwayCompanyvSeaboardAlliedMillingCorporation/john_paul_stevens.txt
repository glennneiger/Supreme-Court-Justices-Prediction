paul

mr.
evans,
can
you
help
me
in
one
perhaps
it's
an
awfully
narrow
question
but
under
a
section
15
proceeding,
if
folks
see
the
word
investigate.
does
the
word
investigate
refer
to
what
the
commission
should
do
before
it
decides
whether
or
not
to
suspend
or
does
it
refer
to
the
examination
made
after
the
suspension?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
doesn't
it
always
follow
that
if
the
commission
has
decided
not
to
suspend,
it
is
also
necessarily
decided
not
to
investigate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
--
then
your
answer
was
misleading.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
got
me
confused.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
an
investigation
may
be
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
to
suspend?
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
you
still
have
me
confused
about
one
thing.
it's
still
seems
to
me
that
if
the
investigation
under
the
statute
is
the
post
suspension
proceeding,
necessarily
a
decision
not
to
suspend
would
include
a
decision
not
to
investigate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
investigation
in
other
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
--
the
word
investigate
under
the
statute
can
refer
two
different
kinds
of
investigations.
one,
a
post-suspension
investigation
and
alternatively,
an
investigation
without
a
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
in
the,
if
there
is
an
investigation
pursuant
to
section
15
not
the
section
13,
the
burden,
i
take
it
is
on
the
carriers
to
demonstrate
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
other
question
was,
in
such
a
proceeding
is,
are
reparations
a
possible
form
of
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
still
the
rate
was
--
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding,
it
was
determined
that
the
rate
have
been
unreasonable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
section
15
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
evans,
i
assume
that
your
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
the
icc's
provision
was
different
and
not
taken
by
the
department
of
justice
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allen,
is
there
a
time
within
which
a
section
13
(1)
proceeding
must
be
commenced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
under
analysis,
a
decision
not
to
investigate
never
become
final
unless
such
a
proceeding
was
some
time
of
two
or
three
years,
some
time
rather
commits
because
there
will
always
be
a
potentiality
that
such
a
proceeding
can
be
commenced
and
terminated
then
that
would
have
the
effect
of
making
final.
the
earlier
decision
by
the
commission
not
to
investigate,
that's
your
theory,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
that's
about
equally
probable
as
you
say
there's
really
little
practical
difference
between
your
position
and
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
that
they
voilated
the
dispose
of
this
case
assuming
either
you
are
the
icc
is
correct.
is
it
the
long
the
line
suggested
by
the
chief
justice
to
say
that
even
assuming
that
the
matter
is
not
entirely
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission.
nevertheless
the
order
is
plainly
not
final.
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
necessary
to
decide.
it
really
is
not
necessary
to
decide
the
difficult
question
you
argue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
caldwell,
if
all
that's
clear,
could
you
not
file
a
13
(1)
proceeding
and
you
get
prompt
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
it's
perfectly
obvious
there's
a
violation
but
you're
saying
because
the
commission
exercises
discretion
not
to
suspend
and
not
to
investigate
even
though
the
patent
violation
were
disclosed
of
the
commission,
as
a
matter
of
pride,
they
wouldn't
rule
that
way?
why
wouldn't
they
rule
that
way
if
you
could
see?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
united
states
and
the
commission
of
represented
to
us
that
the
issue
you
want
raise
would
be
open
in
the
section
13
proceeding.
you're
telling
us
they
are
misrepresenting
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me.
you
described
from
patent
violations
on
the
long
haul
short
haul
relationship
rates
and
your
opponent,
the
icc
points
out
this
tariff
are
quite
large
and
may
contain
thousands
of
changes
in
rates.
roughly,
how
many
changes
are
there
in
this
tariff
and
how
many
violations
do
you
think
they're
patent,
is
it
like
1%
of
it
or
50%
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
out
of
how
many?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thousands?
justice
john
paul
stevens
hundreds
of
thousands?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
did
you
identify
in
your
pleadings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
identified
five
specific
examples
out
of
several
thousands.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend
they
should
decide
the
question
of
law
just
on
the
pleadings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
on
the
basis
of
the
tariff
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
evans,
do
you
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
ordered
a
complete
investigation
of
the
entire
tariff
or
just
to
the
five
instances
that
they
say
were
finally
unlawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
take
the
position
of
these
five
examples
are
or
are
not
unlawful.
