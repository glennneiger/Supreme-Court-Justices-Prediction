mr.
john
h.
caldwell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondents
feel
as
if
there
are
two
separate
cases
that
are
being
presented
to
this
case
--
to
this
court.
the
case
being
argued
--
or
maybe
three
cases,
the
case
being
argued
by
the
united
states,
the
case
being
argued
by
the
railroads
and
the
commission,
and
the
case
which
we
presented
to
the
court
below
which
we
argue
before
this
court.
the
icc,
the
railroads
before
this
court
in
an
abrupt
change
of
its
position,
the
united
states
all
have
repeatedly
mischaracterize
this
case
as
only
involving
a
routine
normal
determination
not
to
suspend
or
investigate
under
section
15
(8).
what
happened
however
was
a
far
different
situation,
what
happened
was
an
unprecedented
abuse
of
statutory
authority
in
the
form
of
commission
action
taken
in
opposition
to
the
clearly
stated
requirement
of
section
4
(1)
in
contrary
to
the
absolute
prohibition
of
that
section
and
that
rates
were
approved
to
become
binding
and
effective
and
harmful
on
all
segments
of
the
public
without
compliance
with
a
clearly
stated
requirement
to
section
4.
now,
what
this
case
is
--
is
an
abuse
of
statutory
authority
of
an
unprecedented
nature
under
section
4
(1),
an
example
of
statutory
misinterpretation
by
the
commission
and
approval
of
rates
as
effective
and
binding
on
the
final
basis
and
an
issuance
of
orders
notably
lacking
any
rational
basis
or
findings.
what
the
case
is
not
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
it's
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
orders
that
were
issued
by
the
commission
as
reviewed
by
the
court
and
that
the
commission
failed
to
resolve
the
allegations
that
the
rates
on
their
face
were
patently
illegal
and
could
not
be
permitted
to
take
effect.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
it
can
be
easily
and
could
have
been
easily
resolved
by
mere
examination
of
the
face
of
the
tariffs
that
had
been
filed
by
the
carriers
with
the
railroads
and
should
have
been
resolved
when
the
allegation
was
made
by
our
side
that
the
rates
on
their
face
could
not
be
allowed
to
take
effect
because
they
were
substantively
annullity
and
that
they
contain
long
and
short
haul
departures.
now,
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
kind
of
appraisal,
i
just
referred
to
and
a
subsequent
15
(8)
type
of
investigation.
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
automatic
prohibition
of
section
401
was
triggered
when
we
made
our
allegation
and
provided
substantial
examples
that
the
tariffs
on
their
face
were
invalid.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
the
statute,
section
4
(1)
prohibits
the
establishment
of
tariffs
that
contain
on
their
face
this
mathematical
relationship
but
longer
charge
--
but
greater
charges
for
shorter
distance
and
a
longer
distance
over
the
same
route
of
haul.
in
effect,
the
commission
ignored
the
statutory
prohibition.
it
was
a
very
simple
and
very
easy
task
for
it
to
have
its
tariff
people
to
simply
look
at
the
tariffs,
even
in
the
absence
of
any
demonstrated
violations
documented
as
such
as
we
document
it.
and
quickly
have
determined
that
these
tariffs
contain
long
and
short
haul
departures.
instead,
the
commission
merely
turned
its
head
and
said
that
it
would
not
reject
and
said
it
would
make
no
findings
and
leave
unresolved
the
question
of
whether
on
their
face,
these
tariffs
were
substantively
invalid
in
violation
of
the
clearly
state
prohibition.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
the
exact
number
of
pages
but
it
was
not
a
substantially
difficult
job
for
the
commission
to
evaluate
the
tariffs
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
pleadings
which
were
evaluated
by
the
commission
in
this
case
were
about
half
the
size
of
the
yellow
pages
of
the
washington
phonebook.
if
the
commission
was
capable
of
analyzing
digesting
that
material,
it
certainly
could
have
its
tariff
people
look
at
the
tariffs.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
this
is
the
approximate
size
of
the
pleadings
that
were
filed
and
resolved
and
digested
by
the
commission
prior
to
its
action
authorizing
the
tariff
to
take
effect.
this
is
the
appendix.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
they
do
it
in
--
in
this
case,
your
honor,
they
did
it
and
i
think
a
little
more
than
four
days
but
this
is
not
an
unusual
section
15
(8)
kind
of
record.
some
of
them
are
even
greater
than
that.
but
our
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
commission
is
entrusted
with
the
enforcement
of
the
section
401
prohibition.
we
provided
specifically
uncontroverted
examples
that
on
the
face
of
these
tariffs,
they
contain
violations
of
the
cause.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
your
honor,
neither
the
commission
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
i
don't
know
what
the
commission
specifically
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
they
haven't
agreed
that
there
were
violations
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
because
apparently,
they
never
had
their
tariff
people
look
at
the
face
of
the
tariffs.
they
haven't
denied
our
position.
they
commission
in
the
railroads
have
not
denied
that
these
rates
contain
violations
on
their
face.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
no,
sir.
we
could
not
your
honor
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
commission
does
not
grant
refunds
in
section
13
proceedings
for
violation
by
itself
of
its
own
statutory
mandate.
it
is
simply
does
not
do
that.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
we
could
not
have
obtained
the
sort
of
review
we
sought
in
the
court
here
by
submitting
the
section
13
complaint.
the
commission
would
not
agree
in
that
proceeding
that
it
had
allowed
illegally
established
tariffs
become
effective.
that
would
have
been
a
futile
exercise
on
our
part.
secondly,
the
commission
historically
does
not
grant
refunds
in
section
13
complaint
cases
or
section
4
violations
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
as
a
matter
of
case
history,
the
commission
takes
a
position
that
overcharges
and
refunds
cannot
be
established
in
s
section
4
proceeding.
in
their
reply
brief,
your
honor,
they
even
state
that
overcharges
are
alien.
and
that's
the
word
they
used,
alien
to
the
concept
of
a
section
13
complaint
proceeding.
historically,
the
commission
takes
a
position
if
you
file
a
section
13
complaint
you
must
established
that
the
rates
are
unreasonable
and
violate
some
other
section
of
the
act
beyond
section
4.
so
even
under
their
own
case
precedent
and
long
established
history,
a
process
in
the
section
13
complaint
case,
we
could
have
obtained
more
no
relief,
but
importantly
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
that's
correct,
they
are.
they
are
misrepresenting
in
the
sense
that
we
could
obtain
refunds
or
overcharges
in
the
section
13
complaint
case
and
we
so
cited
cases
to
that
effect.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
no,
sir.
the
united
states
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
the
united
states
position
is
that
we
would
now
have
to
file
section
13
complaints
and
then
if
we
were
unsuccessful,
we
would
have
to
go
back
to
court
and
at
that
time
obtain
a
review
or
the
failure
to
investigate.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
if
they
had
investigated
and
had
not
suspended,
they
would
have
been
refunds
available.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
assuming
that
the
allegations
have
ultimately
been
established.
but
our
point,
your
honor
is
that
this
is
not
a
section
15
(8)
case
involving
commission
discretion
to
suspend
or
to
investigate.
this
is
a
section
4
case
of
the
type
decided
in
the
mclean
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
type
decided
by
the
seaboard
allied
case
before
the
western
district
of
missouri
where
the
commission
is
violating
on
the
face
of
the
statute
a
prohibition
by
refusing
to
reject
or
suspend
of
for
that
matter
investigate
tariffs
that
were
invalid
on
their
face.
now,
i
think
the
important
thing
the
court
must
understand
is
that
very
coy,
in
a
very
coy
way,
the
railroads
have
never
denied
that
these
departures
exist.
they're
either
in
the
tariffs
or
they
aren't
in
the
tariffs.
the
railroads
have
the
obligation
to
clear
them
out
of
the
tariffs
before
the
file
them
or
file
special
application
for
pre-effectiveness,
permission
to
make
those
tariffs
effective.
the
carriers
have
never
denied
that
these
departures
exist
on
the
face
of
the
commission
--
of
the
tariffs
nor
for
that
matter
has
a
commission
made
such
a
denial.
now
this
case
had
other
unusual
aspects
about
it
beyond
that
fact
it
involved
the
section
401
prohibition.
it
involved
a
special
increase
under
a
specially
delegated
power
from
the
congress
in
section
15,
17.
it
involved
rates
that
were
proposed
at
the
time
of
the
year
when
effective
shippers
had
no
alternative
but
to
pay
the
rates
in
ship
and
suffer
the
injury
that
was
caused
by
the
unlawful
rates.
there
was
a
unique
method
of
processing
the
case
by
the
commission
contrary
to
the
normal
15
(7)
or
15
(8)
type
procedure.
the
commission
established
a
formal
docket
number
and
assigned
it
to
the
case.
it
assigned
the
case
to
processing
by
the
full
commission
and
by
division
two
of
the
commission.
and
finally
and
most
importantly
it
issued
to
formal
written
orders
in
which
it
purported
to
make
findings
on
various
issues
but
in
effect
brushed
aside
the
section
4
(1)
issues.
it's
our
position
that
the
commission
in
effect
has
abrogated
its
responsibility
in
enforcing
section
4
(1)
and
that
this
was
found
by
the
lower
court
and
was
the
reason
why
the
lower
court
ordered
the
case
back
to
the
commission
for
completion
of
the
investigation.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
investigation
of
the
commission
should
have
made
was
one
prior
to
allowing
these
rates
to
take
effect.
they
were
not
self-executing,
they
could
not
be
allowed
to
take
effect
until
these
departures
were
either
cleared
out
of
the
tariffs
or
the
carriers
obtained
permission
for
those
violations.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
i'd
say
that
it's
permissible
whenever
there's
a
statutory
violation
and
i'd
say
that
the
court
should
have
the
power
to
intervene
whenever
the
commission
is
violating
either
its
own
regulations
or
an
organic
statute
which
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
you
could
allege
it
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
would
intervene
and
it
--
that
but
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
only
in
the
event
of
valid
showing
as
they
may.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
we're
not
--
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
talking
in
terms
of
the
semantics
involved.
the
mere
fact
we
made
these
allegations
and
called
them
patent
is
not
to
determining
fact
--
determinative
fact.
the
determinative
fact
is
what
the
commission
did
in
response
to
the
allegations.
it
in
effect,
refused
to
make
any
finding.
it
left
the
allegations
undetermined.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
the
commission
had
two
alternatives.
the
first
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
it
could
have
said
so.
it
could
have
said
that
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
i
could
not
do
that
under
section
4
without
violating
the
congressional
intent
that
rates
of
this
type
not
be
allowed
to
take
effect.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
the
commission
was
dealing
with
a
different
section
then
it
normally
deals
within
a
section
15
(8)
case
and
that
section
makes
clear,
the
commission
has
not
discretion
to
leave
unresolved
allegations
that
there
are
facially
invalid
rates
that
have
been
filed.
this
is
not
a
section
15
(8)
case
in
its
normal
context.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
the
standard
is
a
standard
that
congress
established
in
section
4
(1).
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
the
commission
has
a
couple
of
alternatives,
your
honor.
the
first
is
to
say
that
we
find
the
allegations,
let's
say
frivolous
or
incorrect
because
no
four
section
of
the
court
has
been
established.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
it's
not.
it's
like
a
little
bit
of
pregnancy.
it's
not
evenly
balance.
there's
no
way
that
you
could
evenly
balanced
it.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
well,
with
all
due
respect
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
well,
your
honor,
those
cases,
i'm
unaware
of
would
--
if
they're
under
section
4
(1).
section
4
(1)
is
absolutely
crystal
clear.
it
doesn't
leave
any
room
for
discretion
or
application
of
transportation
judgment
by
the
commission.
and
unless
it
acts
on
an
application
submitted
prior
to
making
the
rates
effective
and
determines
that
a
special
case
has
been
made.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
they
do
not,
your
honor,
because
as
i
earlier
indicated
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
commission
will
not
grant
refunds
that
would
grant
reparations
only
in
the
event
a
shipper
could
establish
unlawfulness
under
other
sections
of
the
act
other
than
section
4
and
the
commission's
cases
clearly
show
that
it
does
not
grant
refunds
or
overcharges
where
illegally
established
rates
in
violation
of
section
4
(1)
have
been
filed.
our
position
here
is
that
this
is
a
commission
violation.
in
other
words,
we
can't
be
required
to
go
to
the
commission
fairly
and
have
adjudicated
the
commission's
violation
of
its
own
statute.
this
is
a
leading
be
kind
sort
of
situation
and
not
a
normal
15
(8).
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
our
--
the
gentleman
who
did
the
checking
of
these
tariffs
for
us
called
me
at
home
last
night
and
said
that
he
stopped
counting
at
500.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
out
of
the
all
the
various
points
involved
and
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
how
many?
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
there
may
be
but
not
hundred
of
thousands,
possibly
thousands,
there's
a
good
chance
that
were
thousands
of
violations
in
the
tariff.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
we'd
--
we
identified
in
our
pleadings
before
the
commission
five
specific
documented
examples
showing
the
tariff
rate
showing
the
points
involved.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
and
we
said
they
were
illustrative
of
hundreds.
we
made
that
allegation.
our
point
is
your
honor,
had
we
not
even
made
that
allegation
documented
it.
the
commission
had
an
obligation
to
at
least
look
at
the
allegation
and
tell
us
where
right
or
wrong.
it
was
very
simple,
the
commission,
mr.
justice
white,
all
it
had
to
do
was
issue
an
order
saying
we
find
the
allegations
frivolous
or
incorrect.
for
the
following
reasons
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
not
our
position,
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
where
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
no,
our
position
is
not
if
any
allegation
whatsoever
is
made
that
the
rate
might
have
some
unlawfulness
and
that
the
commission
must
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
take
the
remaining
amount
of
time
to
answer
the
question
that
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
white
before
the
recess
and
also
deal
on
a
few
other
remaining
points.
mr.
justice
white
inquired
whether
under
our
interpretation
statute
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
icc
issue
or
render
findings
on
any
violations
alleged
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
no,
the
point
here
your
honor
is
that
this
is
not
just
an
allegation
of
unlawfulness
that
can
be
rendered
or
determined
in
a
post
effectiveness
investigation.
this
was
an
allegation
that
the
tariffs
were
not
--
could
not
be
allowed
to
take
effect
because
of
the
clear
language
of
section
4
which
proscribes
any
of
these
tariffs
in
becoming
effective.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
our
case
is
based
on
the
section
4
prohibition
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
--
which
is
organic
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
to
that
extent,
the
commission
cannot
let
rates
take
effect
which
contain
those
violations
on
their
face.
now
as
far
as
other
violations
of
the
act
are
concerned
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
or
sh
--
where
they
should
not
have
committed
the
rates
to
take
effect.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
so
it
should
have
either
rejected
or
suspended
but
at
a
minimum
they
should
have
ordered
a
section
15
(8)
investigation
to
determine
if
the
allegations
without.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
as
far
as
but
that
issue
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case
because
the
lower
court
was
not
reviewing
the
no
suspend
decision
but
the
no
investigate
decision.
so
the
question
of
whether
the
future
court
could
intervene
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
yes,
we
would
say
that
your
honor.
they
had
to,
they
should
have
suspended
or
rejected
because
of
the
obvious
proscription
in
section
4
(1)
and
the
court
should
be
allowed
to
intervene
to
correct
that
unlawfulness
but
short
of
that
the
commission
should
have
investigated
if
it
had
any
doubt
in
its
mind
that
these
violations
existed
in
the
face
of
the
tariffs.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
refusal
to
suspend
in
the
sense
that
the
agency
is
acting
within
its
discretionary
judgment,
your
honor
or
applying
transportation
judgmental
factors
to
the
record.
it
was
not
obliged
to
do
that
here.
this
was
an
abuse
of
statutory
authority
that
comes
within
the
exception
to
the
arrow
rule
as
recently
announced
by
this
court
in
the
taps
case
in
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
so
what
we're
asking
here
is
that
the
court
examine
this
case
in
light
of
the
exception
to
arrow
and
scrap
recently
announced
in
the
taps
case
as
well
as
left
for
remaining
determination
in
footnote
22
in
scrap
one.
in
which
the
court
held
at
that
time
that
it
would
leave
for
future
determination
whether
or
not
exercise
of
failure
to
exercise
the
suspension
power
was
an
abused
to
statutory
authority.
now
with
respect
to
the
patents
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
yes,
sir.
and
oestereich
and
other
such
cases
in
allowing
judicial
intervention
where
there's
a
clear
abuse
of
statutory
authority.
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
tariffs
contained
departures,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
reply
by
the
railroads
at
page
272
of
the
joint
appendix
as
opposed
to
their
later
reply
at
page
292
of
the
appendix.
in
the
first
reply,
they
provided
a
tariff
citation
in
the
specific
demonstration
that
there
was
not
a
departure.
in
the
second
reply,
with
all
due
respect
on
page
292,
there
was
various
mumbo
jumbo
and
legal
language
to
the
effect
that
there
might
be
departures.
but
if
they
were,
they
should
be
excused.
with
respect
to
the
commission's
ability
to
verify
the
departures,
the
commission's
rules
provide
that
that
an
application
should
be
filed
in
advance
or
with
the
filing
of
a
tariff
that
contains
departures
and
provides
it
under
normal
circumstances,
that
application
should
be
filed
30
days
in
advance
of
the
filing
of
the
rate
and
only
after
investigation
under
the
statute
and
finding
the
special
case
can
such
rates
such
as
this
be
to
take
effect.
the
railroads
could
have
filed
an
application
under
section
4.
they
have
months
ahead
of
the
time
they
filed
these
rates
and
that
application
could
have
subject
to
disposition
by
the
commission
pursuant
to
the
clearly
required
standards
of
section
4.
now,
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
the
section
13
relief
provision,
in
scrap
two,
it
was
held
that
whatever
else
remains
for
consideration
of
section
13
proceeding,
the
adequacy
of
the
commission's
determination
of
an
environmental
consideration
did
not
remain.
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
whatever
else
remain
for
determination
in
the
section
13
case,
the
commission's
earlier
failure
to
resolve
the
issue
of
illegality
on
the
face
of
the
tariffs
and
its
failure
to
proscribe
the
tariff
from
becoming
effective
could
not
be
determined
in
the
subsection
section
13
case
on
the
same
rational
it
was
employed
in
scrap
2,
i
--
mr.
john
h.
caldwell
i
appreciate
that
sir.
and
that
mr.
spencer
will
take
the
remaining
time.
