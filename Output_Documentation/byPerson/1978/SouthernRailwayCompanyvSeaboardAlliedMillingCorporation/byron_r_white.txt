quite
different
from
its
position
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
from
your
answer
to
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
its
esoteric?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
arcane,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
yourself?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wish
you
thought
of
it
yourself?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
caldwell,
do
i
understand
the
commission
still
doesn't
agree
with
you
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
they
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
have
--
they
haven't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
agreed
with
you
even
after
all
this
time.
after
bidding
everything
you
ever
said
about,
they
still
haven't
agreed
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
is
your
objection,
the
united
states
position
would
take
care
of
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
would
go
back
and
say
that
they
should
have
investigated.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
say
that
the
decision
did
not
--
to
investigate
was
wrong
and
they'll
put
you
back
in
a
position
that
as
if
the
commission
had
been
investigating.
if
the
commission
has
investigated
here
and
found
the
rates,
shouldn't
be
filed
but
haven't
suspended
them,
there
would
be
a
refund
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
is
its
standard
under
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
would
you
say
the
commission,
when
these
allegations
are
made,
should
it
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
they
say
well,
it's
about
evenly
balance
so
they're
arguable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
i
know
but
(voice
overlap)
sometimes
things
are
not
that
clear
about
what
the
statute
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
sometimes,
the
commission
and
other
agencies
have
changed
their
mind
and
have
been
upheld
on
both
occasions.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
say
that
anytime
you
alleged
a
statute,
so-called
statutory
violation
whether
it's
four
or
some
other
statutory
violation
that
the
commission
must
adjudicated
in
its
suspension
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
investigate
and
then
adjudicate
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
however,
have
rulings
on
legal
points?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
allegation
that
would
have
that
effect,
you
say
the
icc
would
have
to
rule
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
saying
that
they
could
not
--
are
you
saying
they
just
have
to
investigate
or
they
could
not
â€“
that
they
could
not
refuse
to
suspend?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
their
refusal
to
suspend
then
is
reviewable
for
the
same
reason
as
well
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
were
wrong
on
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
refusal
to
suspend?
what
if
the
commission
could
refuse
to
suspend
despite
your
allegation
of
the
section
4
violation?
would
you
say
that
commission
nevertheless
erred
in
refusing
to
investigate?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
suppose
the
allegations
have
been
they
said
there
are
hundreds
and
they
are
as
follows
and
they
listed
500
of
them
and
they
were
as
clear
as
the
bells.
what
about
the
--
which
should
the
commission
do
then
could
they
refuse
to
suspend
and
refuse
to
investigate?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
united
states
and
commission's
position
the
same
in
the
trans
alaska
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
remember
the
footnote?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
gain
and
the
trans
alaska
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
still
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
say
--
this
footnote
says
in
this
court
the
united
states
is
modified
that
position
and
now
apparently
concedes
that
courts
have
jurisdiction
in
view
of
the
suspension
orders
to
the
limit
and
extent
necessary
to
ensure
that
such
orders
do
not
overstep
the
commission's
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
it's
different
if
you
say
it's
alleged
that
you
have
no
authority
to
refuse
to
suspend?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
allegations
say
they
have
absolutely
no
authority
to
suspend
in
the
circuit
---
to
refuse
to
suspend
in
these
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
allegation?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
--
you
say
you've
been
absolutely
consistent
and
are
you
remaining
consistent?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
what
you
said
how
illegal
it
was
alleged
the
rates
were
claimed
to
be
under
section
4,
the
commission
could
refuse
to
suspend
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
having
any
--
without
their
being
reviewability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
they
refuse
to
suspend
it's
reviewable
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
--
then
reviewable?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it's
alleged
here
that
the
commission
has
absolutely
no
discretion
to
refuse
to
suspend
in
this
case
when
it
so
clearly
claimed
that
there's
a
violation
of
section
4
on
the
face
of
the
tariffs.
that's
the
allegation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
that
is
within
the
reviewability
concession
in
taps?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
you
would
make
the
same
argument
between
investigation
and
suspension.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
submission
then
that
even
if
they
are
patently
violative
of
section
4,
the
commission
they
reach
is
suspended?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
they
never
--
there's
not
a
murmur
as
to
whether
they
think
they
are
patently
unlawful
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
are
patently
unlawful?
i
just
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
just
answered
my
brother
stevens
that
the
commission
has
not
passed
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
patently?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
commission
thought
they
were
patent,
could
they
still
refuse
to
suspend?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
what
--
