justice
william
h.
rehnquist
am
i
right
in
thinking
mr.
evans
that
under
section
13
complaint,
the
commission
doesn't
simply
set
as
an
adjudicator
but
it
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
investigate
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
it
just
seat
back
and
say
you
two
contestants
bring
your
evidence
before
we
will
decide
or
does
it
have
to
participate
in
the
investigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
investigation
is
the
same
under
either
13
or
15?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
just
developed
its
esoteric
theory
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
that
arrow
and
scrap
then
are
the
cases
that
control
this
particular
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
congress
just
hadn't
intended
them
to
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
it
follow
if
congress
had
not
intended
review
of
the
suspension
power?
it
would
likewise
had
not
have
intended
review
of
the
authority
to
investigate
preliminary
to
a
suspension?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
something
that
this
loud
point
that
you
just
made
not
the
one
that
it's
just
about
me,
something
that
will
be
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
allegation
one
capable
of
being
resolved
simply
on
the
face
of
your
protest
without
some
sort
of
investigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
okay,
you
use
the
word
substantial
examples
that
the
tariffs
on
their
face
were
invalid,
is
it
your
position
that
the
icc
could
simply
by
having
looked
at
the
tariffs
and
looked
at
the
section
of
the
statute
you
rely
on
concluded
without
any
further
factual
investigation,
the
tariffs
were
invalid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
pages
did
the
tariffs
consist
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
pleadings
were
half
the
size
of
the
yellow
pages
of
the
washington?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
supposed
to
do
that
in
four
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
this
court
serve
court
intervention
is
permissible
only
when
a
violation
of
4
(1)
is
claimed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
you
can
alleged
that
anytime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
it
has
the
power
to
intervene
if
it
thinks
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
valid,
substantial,
you
know
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
caldwell,
let
me
ask
this,
what
if
the
commission
thought
the
allegation
were
simply
frivolous?
it
said
nothing
about
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
it
said
nothing
but
they
thought
they
were
frivolous.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
judicial
review
of
refusal
to
suspend
covered
by
arrow
and
scrap?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
question,
is
when
that
access
is
granted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
the
language
itself
says
“may”
doesn't
it?
