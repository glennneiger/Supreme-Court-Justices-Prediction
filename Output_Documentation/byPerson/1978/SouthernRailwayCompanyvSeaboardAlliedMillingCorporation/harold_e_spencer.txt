mr.
harold
e.
spencer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
from
the
standpoint
of
my
clients
the
crucial
issue
in
this
case
simply
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
the
case
is
--
the
court
is
going
to
decide
our
case
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
and
the
merits
of
our
case
whether
it's
going
to
extend
the
arrow
principle
to
cover
every
situation
where
the
commission
allows
a
rate
to
become
effective
regardless
of
circumstances
and
regardless
of
how
arbitrary
the
commission's
action
is.
i
think
it's
quite
obvious
that
this
case
is
not
like
arrow
and
that
the
arrow
rational
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
the
tariffs
here
are
unlawfully
discriminatory
per
se.
there
is
no
primary
jurisdiction
question
involved.
no
question
of
reasonableness.
there's
no
question
of
injunction
pending
in
investigation.
we
did
not
ask
for
the
investigation
that
was
the
theory
of
the
department
of
justice.
there
are
no
disputed
issues
of
fact.
the
tariff
in
the
case
was
about
four
or
five
pages
long
in
an
answer
to
a
question
raised
earlier
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
it
is
obvious
that
the
issue
could
have
been
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
tariff,
the
protest
and
the
reply.
a
straight
question
of
law
is
involved.
and
on
the
straight
question
of
law,
no
ruling
by
the
commission
is
necessary
and
if
they
had
made
a
ruling
it
would
not
be
binding
on
the
courts.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
question
of
law
which
has
right
for
a
review
at
this
time.
we
say
that
it
is
wrong
to
extend
the
arrow
principle
to
cover
this
type
of
situation
for
reasons
which
i
state
it
is
wrong
for
the
shippers
who
are
involved
in
this
case
and
it
would
be
wrong
for
shippers
in
other
cases
where
the
situation
represented
by
the
amicus
in
this
case
whose
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
being
delayed
pending
a
decision
in
this
case.
the
petitions
here
argue
that
a
decision
for
the
shippers
would
create
an
undue
burden
on
the
courts.
i
submit
that
this
is
a
diversionary
argument.
this
case
is
not
a
typical
15
(8)
case.
it
is
a
very
limited
type
of
situation
and
it
would
occur
very
infrequently.
it
would
not
occur
any
more
often
than
the
alaska
pipeline
type
of
situation
would
occur.
but
more
importantly,
i
submit
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
courts
to
disregard
the
merits
of
individual
cases
in
order
to
make
life
easier
for
the
commission
of
railroads
or
even
for
the
courts.
the
law
clearly
imposes
on
the
commission
certain
obligations
and
clearly
grants
two
shippers
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts
to
correct
arbitrary
action,
abuse
of
discretion
and
other
unlawful
action.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
and
i
believe
it's
very
clear
that
in
this
type
of
situation,
that
access
should
be
granted
when
the
commissioner
refuses
to
suspend
and
investigate.
and
i
shall
like
to
make
it
clear
that
i
draw
no
distinction
between
suspension
and
investigation.
the
commission
in
this
case
should
have
taken
whatever
action
is
necessary
to
prevent
these
tariffs
from
becoming
effective.
now,
normally
that
would
be
rejection
of
the
tariffs
but
suspension
accomplishes
the
same
thing.
so
i
say
that
either
of
those
actions
is
reviewable
and
i
believe
for
the
very
reasons
that
you
heard
here
today,
that
the
shippers
need
the
protection
of
the
courts
more
now
than
on
any
time
of
commission's
history
when
the
commission
is
now
engaged
in
a
program
of
defect
of
deregulation
without
regard
of
the
statutory
standards.
before
our
act
which
you've
heard
a
good
deal
about
today
did
not
repeal
section
2
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
section
2
prohibits
personal
discrimination
in
freight
rates
and
i
submit
that
if
the
railroads
would
attempt
to
raise
rates
for
an
individual
and
not
for
a
corporation,
or
for
women
and
not
for
men,
no
one
could
suggest
that
that
could
not
be
judicially
reviewed
at
the
time
those
rates
became
effective.
this
case
is
no
different
because
the
whole
history
of
the
commission
says
that
when
the
shipper
furnishes
the
car,
he
should
be
compensated
by
the
payment
of
allowance
which
is
what
was
done
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
here
have
studiously
avoided
any
discussions
of
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
i
suggest
that
if
they
could
refute
to
merits,
they
would
have
attempted
to
do
so.
their
principle
argument
is
that
we
can
make
this
same
argument
in
the
complaint
case
to
the
commission
and
that
is
true.
and
that
is
true,
we
can.
but
i
think
that
that
is
meaningless
and
irrelevant
in
this
situation
because
why
should
be
--
we
be
required
to
do
that?
what
do
we
need
to
know
that
we
don't
know
already?
there
aren't
any
disputed
issues
of
fact.
we
know
that
the
railroads
made
a
20%
increase
in
railroad
cars
but
not
in
private
cars.
we
knew
that
the
rates
before
the
increase
were
the
same
and
we
know
that
the
shippers
whose
furnished
private
cars
are
compensated
by
a
published
allowance
as
required
by
section
15
paragraph
(15)
of
the
act
as
it
formally
existed.
furthermore,
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
because
i
don't
--
because
we
want
to
settle
this
principle
and
i
think
in
this
case,
what
we
had
here
was
the
seasonal
rate.
we
had
a
rate
was
in
effect
for
three
months
and
i
believe
that
we
were
entitled
to
raise
the
issue
in
this
case
as
to
the
right
of
the
railroads
to
put
this
in
discriminating
between
the
two
different
types
of
cars.
now
by
the
time
the
court
would
reach
the
decision
on
the
merits,
the
suspension
problem
had
become
moot
because
the
rates
were
already
in
and
were
out.
so,
i
think
the
issue
could
be
settled
but
it
is
an
extremely
important
question
of
principle.
now,
they
also
say
in
the
reply
brief,
they
cite
some
cases
which
they
say
refutes
our
argument.
this
is
not
correct.
they
say
that
in
the
you
are
rendered
to
arraign
case
that
the
commission
found
lawful,
rates
of
a
million
dollars
a
year
and
railroad
furnished
cars
and
$700,000.00
and
shipper
furnished
cars.
that's
an
incorrect
statement.
the
commission
found
the
rates
in
a
railroad
equipment
to
be
unlawful.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
found
the
whole
rent
a
train
scheme
to
be
unlawful
in
so
far
as
the
railroads
cars
are
concerned.
the
other
cases
they
cite,
the
other
two
cases
arose
during
the
period
of
federal
control
and
more
one
and
none
of
the
cases
was
an
allowance
involved.
in
the
allowance,
we
don't
deny
that
the
railroads
can
publish
rates
in
private
cars,
and
that
those
rates
would
be
different
or
could
be
different
from
the
rates
in
railroad
cars
so
long
as
they
don't
pay
an
allowance.
there
are
rates
to
that
effect
today
but
what
we
say
is
that
they
can't
do
both.
that
they
can't
pay
an
allowance
and
then
make
a
discriminatory
rate
on
top
of
it
and
there
is
no
case
in
the
history
of
the
commission
that
says
that
they
can
up
to
this
time.
so
all
we
really
want
to
do
is
to
have
the
opportunity
to
show
the
reviewing
court
that
the
tariffs
were
in
fact
discriminatory
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
if
we
can't
show
that,
we're
out
of
court.
but
if
we
can
show
it,
then
i
think
we're
entitled
of
the
relief
that
we
ask
for.
and
i
would
just
like
in
closing
to
make
one
remark
that
i
believe
that
the
question
of
reviewability
and
the
question
of
remedy
selected
by
the
court
below
are
really
two
different
questions.
the
court
below
correctly
held
that
the
commission's
action
was
reviewable.
now,
as
i
say
when
the
case
was
first
presented
to
the
court
below,
they
denied
the
tro
but
they
denied
it
on
the
merits.
they
didn't
deny
it
because
of
failure
to
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
that
kind
of
an
argument
or
to
hear
that
kind
of
a
case.
they
denied
it
on
the
balance
of
the
equities.
but
i
think
that
on
the
question
of
reviewability
that
it
is
very
clear
that
that
is
reviewable.
now,
i
suggested
that
since
a
straight
question
of
law
is
involved
that
this
court
can
decide
that
question
and
simply
tell
the
eighth
circuit
to
order
refunds
in
the
case.
i
think
also
it
would
be
quite
appropriate
for
this
court
simply
to
tell
the
eighth
circuit
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
question
of
law.
but
i
don't
think
an
investigation
is
necessary
as
i
say,
we
didn't
ask
for
it.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
we
put
up
and
request
on
the
law
that
we
submitted
to
the
eighth
circuit.
we
submitted
the
brief
on
the
legal
issue.
thank
you
your
honor.
