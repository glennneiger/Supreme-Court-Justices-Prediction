powell,

you
are
using,
the
labor
board's
definition
of
patient
care,
aren't
you
mr.
come?
the
doctor's
testimony
quite
explicitly
associated
patient
care
with
somewhat
now
of
these
public
areas
and
that
testimony
is
undisputed.

talked
about
work
areas?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
corridors
of
the
hospital
were
not
associated
with
patient
care?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

does
the
board
apply
its
rule
to
hospital
corridors?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
light
of
that
testimony,
what
happened
to
it?
you
say
it's
out
of
the
case.

i'd
like
to
get
back
to
your
statement,
about
this
corridor
that's
not
being
used
for
treatment.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
the
first
thing
doctors
not
try
to
do
following
surgery
is
to
get
that
patient
out
into
the
corridors
and
into
the
rooms
or
the
sitting
rooms,
or
waiting
rooms
or
where
they
visit
with
families
and
friends,
then
they
move
up
and
down
as
the
record
clearly
shows
on
wheelchairs,
on
stretchers
to
and
from
treatment
rooms
and
nobody
can
tell
in
advance
when
a
patient
will
be
so
postured.
but
coming
back
to
the
original
point,
i'd
like
to
know
whether
the
corridors
in
this
case
are
there.
i
thought
they
were
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gold,
i'm
sorry,
i
beg
your
pardon
right
there.
you
referred
to
testimony
on
pages
60
and
61
but
if
you
keep
reading,
i
don't
suggest
you
do
it
now,
you
can
take
my
word
for
it,
and
if
i'm
wrong
and
then
you
can
speak.
top
of
page
62,
the
same
doctor
when
asked
about
the
effect
on
patients.
he
said,
that
doesn't
have
to
be
a
fight
or
argument
or
heated
discussion.
if
the
patients
get
the
idea
that
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
taking
care
of
them,
have
their
mind
on
something
else,
they
are
not
very
happy
about
it.
