mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
continue
with
the
point
that
mr.
come
was
discussing,
it
is
our
understanding
that
under
the
board's
present
approach,
the
first
inquiry
is
in
--
is
whether
a
particular
area
is
an
immediate
patient
care
area
or
not.
their
factual
and
legal
problems
in
making
that
determination
just
as
there
are
in
making
any
other
determination
and
the
board
has
not
yet
articulated
its
approach
to
solving
all
the
questions
and
arriving
at
the
lines
of
demarcation
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
blue
brief
we
reprint
our
submission
to
the
board
in
a
series
of
cases
which
have
come
back
to
the
board
after
beth
israel,
where
we
discussed
an
approach
to
the
differing
rules
that
could
be
applied
at
page
40
through
42
that
could
be
applied
in
the
different
flat
functional
areas
of
the
hospital
if
that
is
the
board's
view
to
the
proper
approach.
but
in
any
rate,
corridors
are
in
the
case,
this
case
but
they're
treated
under
the
board's
order
only
by
a
distinction
between
patient
care
and
nonpatient
care
areas
and
that
has
to
be
made
more
concrete
depending
on
what
happens
in
this
court
in
handling
the
basic
question
of
whether
the
overall
board
approach
is
right
or
at
least
right
with
regards
to
areas
other
than
cafeterias.
i'd
like
to
spend
the
remainder
of
my
time
making
three
basic
points.
the
first
is
that
the
overall
presumption
here
seems
to
us
to
be
a
common
sense
way
of
developing
the
law.
it
rests
on
two
basic
premises
of
the
act.
one
is
that
stated
by
this
court
in
the
magnavox
case
in
415
u.s.
that
the
working
place
or
at
least
nonworking
areas
of
the
working
place
are
uniquely
appropriate
for
employee
communication
that
they
are
presumptively
saved
to
the
employees
for
distribution
and
solicitation.
and
secondly,
a
point
made
in
numerous
labor
law
cases,
most
specifically
i
would
think
in
the
allen
case
373
u.s.
that
the
party
with
the
facts
and
the
knowledge
is
the
one
who
ought
to
have
the
burden
of
proof
of
demonstrating
its
position.
and
here
of
course,
the
hospital
position
is
that
patient
care
would
suffer
at
least
in
certain
regards
if
solicitation
distribution
is
allowed.
the
hospital
claims
to
have
the
expertise
in
--
with
regard
to
these
medical
questions
and
it's
appropriate
it
seems
to
us
to
put
the
burden
on
the
hospital.
this
is
a
rebuttable
presumption.
this
is
not
a
rule
of
law
that
we're
discussing
here.
the
board's
position
that
a
broad
ban
on
employee
discussion
is
presumptively
unlawful
in
the
hospital
can
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
we're
simply
--
mr.
laurence
gold
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
would
be
occasions
where
it
might.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
best
way
i
can
answer
that
question
is
to
turn
to
(a)
(66)
of
the
record.
the
--
at
that
point,
mr.
french
who
did
the
soliciting
here
for
the
union
stated
what
solicitation
was
and
we're
talking
about
an
abstraction
here
and
i
think
helps
to
make
it
more
concrete.
he
said,
he
solicited
in
the
cafeteria
and
he
said
i
asked
if
i
could
join
people,
other
employees
who
were
sitting
down
taking
a
break
and
eating,
and
sat
down
and
talked
with
them.
that's
what
solicitation
is.
it's
not
a
something
that's
unusual
for
people
to
do
on
their
breaks.
people
whether
they're
bell
boys,
whether
hospital
personnel.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
--
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
it
was
a
nonworking
area
for
them
and
whether
they
were
on
nonworking
time.
the
reason
i
responded
as
i
did
was
that
it
depends,
i
would
think
on
what
they
do.
if
you
have
two
bell
boys,
to
use
your
example,
who
are
taking
a
break
which
is
permitted
to
them
in
a
corner
of
a
hospital
and
one
says
to
the
other,
we
don't
have
a
union
here
it
would
be
good
if
we
had
one.
and
they
have
a
quiet
conversation
in
the
first
--
and
the
person
who
to
whom
that
subject
is
brought
says,
either
that's
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea.
i
don't
see
why
--
what
employer
interest,
what
hospital
interest,
what
hotel
interest
ought
to
say
that
that
is
inappropriate.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
are
standing
at
the
front
desk
holding
a
customer's
suitcases
and
having
that
conversation
with
the
customer
standing
there
when
they
are
in
working
time,
that's
a
very
different
case.
so
all
i
was
trying
to
say
is
that
solicitation
is
the
task
of
normally
of
discussing
and
if
it
happens
in
an
area
where
such
discussions
are
common,
where
there
is
conversation,
people
walking
around,
conversing
on
many
different
subjects,
it's
difficult
for
us
to
see
why
off
duty
employees
in
a
nonworking
area
should
not
be
permitted
to
engage
in
that
activity.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
the
nonhospital
context
or
at
least,
the
factory
context
maybe
a
better
word,
solicitation
has
been
permitted
in
working
areas
during
nonworking
time
but
not
distribution.
that
is
a
rule
that
i
doubt
if
the
board
would
follow
in
areas
where
the
public
is
present.
and
the
reason
that
i've
taken
your
time
to
stress
the
point
i've
made
is
that
the
medical
testimony
in
this
case
seems
to
us
to
suffer
from
a
basic
defect.
it
is
that
the
doctors
didn't
know
what
solicitation
was.
again,
i'd
like
to
direct
you
to
page
61
of
the
record.
dr.
ricketson
after
testifying
for
a
length
of
time
that's
reflected
in
pages
51
through
60
of
the
record
is
cross-examined
and
the
question
is
union
solicitation,
do
you
know
what
effect
it
would
have?
answer,
first
may
i
ask
the
question
to
be
sure
you
and
i
understand?
what
is
union
solicitation?
what
does
it
consists
of?
the
medical
testimony
by
and
large
assumes
that
union
solicitation
involves
turmoil
confusion,
loud
noises,
speeches,
and
so
on.
we
think
no
matter
what
the
basic
legal
rule
is
that
whether
there
is
a
presumption
for
or
against
solicitation,
the
ultimate
question
ought
to
be
that
whatever
the
ultimate
basic
point
ought
to
be
that
whatever
standard
an
employer
adopts
if
it
bears
more
heavily
on
union
solicitation
of
a
kind
that
i've
indicated
goes
on
in
this
case,
then
on
cognate
nonunion
activities
discussion
of
other
issues
which
may
have
just
as
great
in
effect
on
somebody
maybe
just
as
likely
to
result
on
an
argument.
now,
my
working
experience
says
that
the
most
likely
areas
for
argument
are
questions
of
who
is
going
to
win
the
world
series
and
foreign
policy
and
so
on.
if
you
have
general
discussion,
union
discussion
ought
to
be
permitted.
that
is
the
basic
point,
we
submit.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
may
i
respond
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
laurence
gold
if
i
have
time
i
have
plan
to
go
on
to
that
but
the
reason
that
we
think
the
board
could
disregard
that
testimony
is
the
reason
i
concluded
with.
certainly,
if
the
hospital
goes
to
the
point
of
saying
that
employees
in
the
cafeteria,
employees
on
breaks
wherever
there
is
--
wherever
members
of
the
public
may
be
can't
talk
to
each
other
about
anything,
then
perhaps
that
rationale
makes
some
sense
but
that
isn't
the
way
this
hospital
works.
this
is
just
like
beth
israel
where
they
tell
to
the
people
who
work
at
the
hospital
that
if
they
discuss
patient
care,
they
should
be
careful
not
to
be
overheard.
there
isn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence
here
that
if
anybody
senses
employee
conversations
on
any
issue
other
than
union
issues.
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
first
point.
that
testimony
is
testimony
that
has
nothing
to
with
the
real
world.
the
hospital
permits
tv,
it
permits
radio,
patients
talk
to
each
other,
visitors
talk
to
each
other,
that's
the
test.
