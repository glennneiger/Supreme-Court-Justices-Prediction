mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
that
involves
the
application
of
the
principles
for
determining
the
validity
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
rules
barring
employee
union
solicitation
and
literature
distribution
in
hospitals
which
were
enunciated
by
this
court's
decision
in
beth
israel
hospital
last
term.
the
facts
are
briefly
these.
this
baptist
hospital
is
a
nonprofit
hospital
located
in
nashville.
it
has
600
patient
beds
and
more
than
1,800
employees.
for
a
number
of
years
prior
to
october
1974,
the
hospital
maintained
the
rule
which
prohibited
anyone
to
solicit
patients
or
visitors
while
on
hospital
premises
without
written
approval
of
the
administration.
in
august
of
1974,
congress
enacted
the
health
care
amendments
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
bringing
nonprofit
hospitals
under
the
act's
coverage.
in
response
to
these
amendments
and
to
the
fact
that
the
union
had
began
a
campaign
to
organize
the
hospitals
employees,
the
hospital
after
consulting
with
its
lawyers
but
not
with
any
doctors
issued
in
october
1974
a
revised
rule.
the
rule
provided
in
pertinent
part
that
no
solicitations
of
any
kind
including
solicitations
for
union
membership
will
be
permitted
by
employees
at
anytime
including
work
time
and
non-work
time
in
any
area
of
the
hospital
which
is
accessible
to
or
utilized
by
the
public.
solicitation
was
barred
in
other
areas
by
employees
who
were
supposed
to
be
working
or
when
conducted
in
such
a
way
as
to
interfere
with
employees
who
are
working.
the
effect
of
this
rule
is
to
bar
employee
solicitation
and
literature
distribution
in
such
public
areas
as
the
hospital's
cafeteria,
gift
shop,
lobbies,
public
restrooms,
entrances
and
even
the
parking
lot
across
the
street
from
the
hospital
and
to
confine
such
activity
to
nonpublic
areas
which
were
not
--
or
where
not
all
the
employees
were
accessible.
the
board
upon
charges
filed
by
the
union
concluded
that
the
revised
rule
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
to
the
extent
that
it
prohibited
employees
on
soliciting
the
union
during
their
non-work
time
in
areas
of
the
hospital
other
than
the
immediate
patient
care
areas,
the
board
in
short
followed
its
decision
in
saint
john's
hospital
that
held
while
a
hospital
could
lawfully
bar
employee
solicitation
or
literature
distribution
in
immediate
patient
care
areas
such
as
the
patient's
rooms,
operating
rooms,
and
therapy
rooms
are
barred
on
that
activity
in
other
areas
was
presumptively
invalid
absent
a
showing
by
the
hospital
that
was
necessary
to
avoid
disruption
of
patient
care.
and
the
board
adopting
the
findings
of
the
administrative
law
judge
concluded
that
the
hospital
had
not
made
that
showing
of
special
need
here.
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
decision
rendered
before
this
court's
decision
in
beth
israel
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
order.
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
the
testimony
by
the
hospital
and
two
doctors
as
to
the
necessity
for
creating
and
maintaining
a
tranquil
atmosphere
throughout
the
hospital
for
patients
and
visitors
was
sufficient
to
establish
special
circumstances
that
warranted
the
hospital's
restriction
of
employee
solicitation
and
distribution
in
these
public
areas.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
not
applying
the
principles
that
this
court
enunciated
in
the
beth
israel
case.
in
beth
israel,
the
court
held
that
the
board's
general
approach
of
requiring
a
health
care
facilities
to
permit
employee
solicitation
and
distribution
during
nonworking
time
in
nonworking
areas
where
the
hospital
had
not
justified
the
prohibitions
as
necessary
to
avoid
disruption
of
healthcare
operations
was
consistent
with
the
act.
and
the
court
went
on
to
find
that
the
board
had
reasonably
applied
that
principle
in
concluding
that
the
hospital
had
overstepped
the
line
in
prohibiting
employee
solicitation
in
its
cafeteria
which
was
used
primarily
by
employees
but
also
by
patients
and
visitors.
now,
this
case
differs
from
beth
israel
in
that
it
involves
not
only
the
hospital
cafeteria
but
other
public
areas
accessible
to
patients
and
their
families.
in
addition,
as
i
indicated,
there
was
a
testimony
by
the
hospital
administrator
and
the
two
of
its
doctors
in
an
effort
to
justify
the
rule.
now,
let's
look
at
the
facts
here.
a
hospital
cafeteria
here
is
essentially
similar
to
that
in
beth
israel.
the
hospital
study
of
cafeteria
usage
is
not
as
detailed
as
it
was
in
beth
israel.
however,
it
shows
that
the
employee
usage
was
nonetheless
substantial,
68%
on
weekdays
and
at
least
47%
on
weekends,
at
least
of
those
that
went
through
the
line.
the
percentage
of
patients
in
the
remaining
32%
or
53%
of
the
cafeteria's
patrons
is
not
shown
by
the
hospital
study
but
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
patients
used
the
cafeteria,
most
of
them
obtained
their
meals
in
their
rooms
and
they
can
only
go
down
to
the
cafeteria
if
they
receive
special
permission
to
go
down
there.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i'm
emphasizing
it
to
show
that
the
--
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
the
use
of
the
cafeteria
was
a
predominant
part
of
the
hospital's
therapeutic
treatment
here.
that
the
use
of
the
--
that
the
cafeteria,
the
testimony
shows
was
primarily
a
place
of
the
employees
took
their
breaks
and
want
to
relax
and
the
patient
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
and
here,
as
in
beth
israel,
the
same
fact
is
present.
similarly,
the
other
public
areas
in
which
employee
solicitation
and
distribution
was
barred
are
areas
which
the
hospital
did
not
consider
to
be
patient
care
or
work
areas.
there's
testimony
by
the
hospital
administrator,
dr.
victory
to
the
effect
that
none
of
these
areas
were
regarded
as
a
work
area
or
an
area
of
patient
care
or
treatment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
i'm
going
by
the
testimony
of
the
hospital
administrator
who
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
he
defined
a
work
area
as
an
area
where
a
patient
received
care
or
treatment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i'm
not
but
the
--
but
we
do
not
have
the
corridors
of
the
hospital
involved
in
this
case.
what
we
have
here
is
the
cafeteria,
two
lobbies,
and
the
gift
shop
and
a
parking
lot
and
the
entrances
which
except
for
the
emergency
rooms
were
considered
by
the
hospital
administrator
not
to
be
patient
care
areas.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
baylor
hospital
found
that
it
had
and
the
board
was
reversed
on
that
because
on
the
ground
that
the
--
there
was
not
--
the
hospital
had
shown
enough
facts
to
indicate
that
those
hospitals,
that
those
corridors
were
associated
with
patient
care.
we
do
not
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
hospital
in
this
case
permitted
solicitation
in
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
you
could
--
it
would
--
the
hospital
could
show
that
those
were
patient
care
areas
and
i
think
in
most
hospitals,
it
would
be
easy
to
show
that.
what
you
have
here
is
just
as
a
blanket
rule
that
bars
solicitation
in
any
--
in
every
public
area
of
the
hospital.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
--
i
think
that
it
would
depend
upon
whether
it
could
be
shown
that
that
was
a
work
area
or
a
patient
care
area.
that
has
not
been
litigated
to
my
knowledge
in
any
of
these
cases,
so
far.
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
will
be
as
we
get
into
these
cases
more
fully.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
--
i
would
think
so.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
know
your
honor
what
the
board
has
done
as
to
take
back
some
of
the
other
hospital
cases
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that?
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
know
of
no
specific
case
involving
the
corridors.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
what
the
board
order
says
is
that
the
hospital
just
cannot
have
a
blanket
ban
in
these
public
areas.
what
they
have
to
do
is
to
define
with
more
precision
what
are
their
patient
care
areas
and
even
with
respect
to
nonpatient
care
areas.
what
are
areas
where
it
is
likely
that
this
sort
of
activity
would
interfere
with
patient
care?
they
have
not
done
any
of
that
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i'd
like
to
get
to
that
testimony
but
i
will
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
--
that
testimony
in
short
merely
indicated
that
--
and
it
was
given
after
the
rule
was
promulgated,
it
was
essential
to
keep
a
tranquil
atmosphere,
well,
throughout
the
hospital,
that
when
the
doctors
were
asked
about
union
solicitation,
as
my
brother,
mr.
gold
will
indicate
in
more
detail,
he
indicated
that
what
they
were
concerned
about
was
loud
or
hostile
or
volatile
union
solicitation
and
that
peaceful
solicitation
one
on
one,
they
did
not
think
would
affect
patient
care.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
this
is
not
in
a
patient
care
area.
it
is
not
--
it
is
when
the
employees
are
off
duty.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
they're
in
unless
the
hospital
is
able
to
demonstrate
that
they
are
patient
care
areas
or
that
the
activity
there
would
interfere
with
patient
care.
they
are
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
either.
either,
either.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
did
because
they
found
that
the
hospital
there
had
introduced
evidence
which
showed
that
the
corridors
were
not
--
were
patient
care
areas.
that
there
was
enough
evidence
to
put
in
there
to
show
that
the
corridor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
baylor
hospital.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
their
only
cafeteria
was
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
in
turn
remanded
that
the
cafeteria
issued
back
to
the
board.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
corridor
issue
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
you
did,
your
honors.
mr.
norton
j.
come
right,
because
what
the
reason
for
denying
cert
was
that
the
court
viewed
it
as
a
substantial
evidence
question
in
that
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
what
the
opinion
for
the
court
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
said.
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
