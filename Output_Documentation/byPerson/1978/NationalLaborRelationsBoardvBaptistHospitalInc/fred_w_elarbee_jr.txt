mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i'd
like
to
visit
with
the
court
for
a
moment
before
i
start
my
argument
and
particularly
with
mr.
justice
stewart,
some
24
years
ago
in
1955,
i
argued
my
very
first
case,
the
court
of
appeals
in
cincinnati.
at
that
time,
i
was
representing
the
ironworkers
international
union.
since
that
time
i
was
going
to
the
other
side,
i
want
to
say
that
justice
stewart
was
on
that
panel.
it's
a
pleasure
to
get
--
to
see
you
again
justice
stewart.
i
might
say
in
passing
that
i
hope
better
i
had
better
luck
here
today
than
i
had
that
day
24
years
ago.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
yes,
hope
so.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
if
the
court
please,
what
we
have
here
is
an
attempt
by
the
board
to
establish
a
rule
that
arises
out
of
an
industrial
setting
to
a
hospital
situation
which
simply
does
not
fit.
it's
quite
one
thing
when
you
talk
about
a
manufacturing
plant
where
all
the
employees
are
involved
and
another
when
you
talk
about
a
situation
where
third
parties'
rights
and
interests
are
involved.
of
course
the
board
got
into
that
in
the
retail
store
cases,
but
here,
you
have
even
a
further,
more
direct
and
important
interest
involved,
it
seems
to
me,
and
that
is
the
right
of
the
patient,
or
what
the
patient
can
expect
when
he
goes
to
the
hospital
sometimes
quite
ill.
and
what
the
patient's
attitude
is
with
respect
to
what's
happening
to
him
and
those
around
in
the
hospital.
so
i
think
the
board
in
establishing
a
rule
that
simply
says
immediate
patient
care
areas
and
speaks
to
such
areas
such
as
the
operating
room,
the
patient's
room
and
perhaps
the
x-ray
room.
it's
far
to
a
limited
rule
given
a
modern
day
hospital
when
as
this
record
shows
as
in
baptist
hospital
patients
are
likely
to
be
all
with
the
hospital.
the
patients
who
are
ambulatory,
patients
who
are
transported
to
different
places
in
the
hospital,
the
rule
simply
doesn't
fit
in
light
of
the
testimony
of
this
record.
in
beth
israel,
justice
blackmun
expressed
this
concern
in
a
concurring
opinion.
i
fear
that
this
unusual
case
will
be
deemed
to
be
an
example
for
all
hospital
eating
facility
cases
and
that
the
board
and
the
courts
now
will
go
further
down
the
open
solicitation
rule
than
they
would
have
done
had
a
more
usual
hospital
case
than
the
first
one
to
come
here.
justice
brennan
in
writing
the
majority
opinion
advised
the
board
to
follow
the
cases
and
the
hospital
cases
as
it
came
before
them
not
to
take
beth
israel
as
a
standard,
it
necessarily
was
to
be
applied
in
all
cases.
and
i
think
what
we
have
is
the
board
taking
its
rule
as
enunciated
in
st.
john's
hospital
and
which
form
the
foundation
for
beth
israel
which
this
court
decided
earlier
on
a
completely
and
vastly
different
record.
it's
taking
its
rule
in
st.
john's
has
applied
it
again
in
this
case
without
even
a
discussion
of
the
record
evidence
in
his
decision
than
on
a
basis
of
a
footnote.
but
we're
following
st.
john
in
a
footnote,
so
what
we
have
first
of
all
it
seems
to
me
is
a
board
establishing
a
rule
that
rises
primarily
out
of
an
industrial
situation,
a
manufacturing
plant,
attempting
to
transpose
it
with
some
modern
modification
to
a
hospital
with
immediate
patient
care
areas
and
it
simply
will
not
fit
for
a
hospital
such
as
baptist.
first
of
all,
i
like
to
point
out
that
there
were
substantial
differences
in
the
record
evidence
in
this
case
that
was
presented
this
court
in
the
beth
israel
case.
justice
blackmun
anticipated
that
this
--
justice
powell
in
his
concurring
opinion
anticipated
that
this
might
very
well
arise.
some
of
the
things
that
are
substantially
different
it
seems
to
me
is
in
a
much
greater
showing
in
this
case
that
there
was
public
use,
visitors
and
relatives
in
the
baptist
hospital
cafeteria
and
i
suppose
along
with
that
non-employees
are
perhaps
patients,
it
doesn't
show.
but
it
does
show
that
about
32%
of
the
patrons
in
the
cafeteria
during
weekdays
were
visitors
or
were
nonemployees.
it
could've
been
patients
and
visitors,
i
suppose.
about
53%
or
a
majority
on
the
weekends
were
not
employees
in
the
cafeteria.
in
the
medical
testimony,
the
unrefuted,
uncontradicted
testimony
was
that
it
has
anything
unsettling
that
occurs,
circumstances
that
occur
to
a
relative
of
the
patient
is
inevitably
rubs
off
from
the
patient
and
could
certainly
affect
the
recovery
or
the
progress
of
the
patient
with
respect
to
the
treatment
he
was
receiving
at
the
hospital.
so
you
have
contrasted.
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
said
i
believe
in
beth
israel
what
seems
to
be
a
typically
employee-oriented
cafeteria.
that's
not
the
record
in
baptist
hospital
where
certainly
on
weekends,
a
majority
at
least
according
to
the
surveyor,
it
was
a
limited
survey
according
to
the
record
shows
that
majority
of
the
people
visiting
the
cafeteria
over
weekends
were
nonemployees,
are
visitors
to
the
hospital.
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
further
and
if
you
read
this
record,
all
through
it,
the
medical
experts,
the
doctors,
treated
the
hospital
as
a
whole,
as
a
patient
care
area,
those
area
of
the
hospital
where
the
patients
were
likely
to
be
found.
they
did
not
distinguish
between
the
operating
room
or
the
patient's
room
or
the
gift
shop
where
patients
visit
to
get
a
newspaper
or
perhaps
cigarettes
or
some
other
reason.
those
doctors
did
not
distinguish
between
these
areas
and
immediate
patient
care
areas
as
the
board
has
done.
another
thing
that
was
so
vastly
different
about
beth
israel
and
is
not
true
in
this
case,
the
record
evidence
in
that
case
showed
that
the
hospital
itself,
apparently
because
there
were
only
about
9%
--
the
business
of
that
cafeteria
were
9%
of
the
visitors
had
used
it
for,
had
allowed
individual
one
on
one
solicitation
prior
to
this
case
arise,
it
had
used
it
for
the
types
of
solicitation
for
charities,
various
types
of
charities.
it
had
established
a
table
and
display
rack
for
brochures
and
other
important,
other
employee
information.
that's
not
true
in
baptist
hospital.
this
record
shows
that
this
rule
had
been
imposed
for
many
years.
they
had
not
allowed
solicitation
in
the
cafeteria.
it
even
shows
that
mr.
victory,
i
believe
it
was
his
testimony
that
one
employee
attempting
to
sell
avon
products
in
the
cafeteria
was
disallowed
prior,
long
before
this
case
arose.
it's
been
a
consistent
rule
consistently
applied.
i
think
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
if
they're
going
to
apply
the
rule
as
they
say
they
did.
they
say
that
solicitation
is
to
dig
that.
they
mean
it,
they
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
according
to
the
rule
mr.
justice,
the
solicitation
or
selling
things
of
that
sort
are
not
permitted
in
the
public
access
areas.
i
think
the
hospital
demonstrated
in
this
record
with
a
testimony
that
the
doctors
had
good
reason
for
that.
and
i
suppose
the
patient
might
get
away
with
something
like
that
but
certainly
it's
not
permitted
on
the
rule.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
he
could
invite
him
to
his
room
and
i
suppose
that
might
be
alright
if
only
the
patient,
his
insurance
salesman
was
there.
but
certainly
they
would
not
want
--
they
would
not
want
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
no,
sir.
although
people
are
permitted
i
think
from
time
to
time
to
visit
the
ward
but
i
don't
think
they
want
anybody
selling
anybody,
anything
in
the
hospital
ward.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
i
suppose
he
could
talk
to
him
about
important
matters
such
as
will,
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
but
mr.
justice
marshall,
i'd
like
to
get
to
a
point
here
i
think
it
may
be
somewhat
misleading.
there's
no
need
for
this
court
or
for
us
or
any
of
us
to
assume
that
union
solicitation
is
just
another
type
of
ordinary
conversation
carried
on
between
two
people
in
a
quiet
and
unassuming
manner.
this
court
long
ago
recognized
in
one
of
the
early
free
speech
cases
and
i
think
the
language
was
something
like
the
language
of
the
picket
line
is
not
the
parlance
of
the
power.
i
don't
know
whether
metamora
days,
one
of
the
old
free
speech
cases
long
time
ago.
well,
certainly
this
is
not
a
picket
line
but
the
board
has
itself
recognize
that
union
solicitation
can
be
unsettling.
it
said
it
in
st.
john's.
it
said,
admittedly
union
solicitation
would
be
unsettling
but
they
said
in
immediate
patient
care
areas.
now
how
can
you
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
well,
i
could
go
along
with
you
a
little
bit
on
that
context.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
pardon,
sir?
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
really
couldn't.
i'd
say
that
the
facts
are
completely
distinguished
however
from
what
it
appeared
in
beth
israel
and
i
think
that
this
--
the
question
you
raised
was
also
applicable
to
the
board's
standard
of
immediate
patient
care
area.
if
something
is
unsettled,
certainly,
it
can
be
unsettling
in
the
gift
shop,
in
the
cafeteria,
in
the
corridor
as
well
as
in
the
patient's
room
for
instance.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
draw
that
kind
of
line.
first
of
all
i
think
it's
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
the
court
below
did
too.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
yes,
sir.
according
to
the
record,
this
hospital
allows
people
during
nonwork
time
employees
in
the
nurses'
stations
to
carry
on
solicitation
in
those
locations.
the
record
shows
that
it
has
occurred
in
those
locations
and
the
hospital
is
not
doing
anything
about
it
or
it
has
reprimanded
employees
for
it.
now,
beyond
that,
where
do
you
want
me
to
go?
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
record
shows
that
employees
take
breaks
in
the
nurses'
stations.
it
also
shows
that
the
nurses'
stations
are
rather
large
areas.
i
believe
it's
20
by
40
feet.
and
i'm
sure
most
of
us
have
been
on
hospitals
and
seen
people
sitting
in
the
nurses'
station
drinking
coca-cola,
drinking
coffee
and
not
at
work.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
well
i
--
but
at
least
the
record
--
pardon
sir?
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
it
is
primarily
as
i
understand
it
sir
a
work
area
but
according
to
the
evidence
in
this
record
at
this
hospital,
it
is
used
for
employees
for
breaks
also
and
the
utility
rooms
next
door.
that's
unrefuted
in
the
testimony.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
is
a
work
area
separated
from
the
patients
and
the
public
by
glass
partitions
according
to
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
question
was
asked
why
would
a
hospital
permit
it?
the
only
reason
that
i
can
assume
is
that
it
is
a
rather
large
area.
they
do
take
breaks
in
the
area
and
if
they
are
not
at
work
then
i
suppose
a
hospital
says
it's
a
public
or
the
patients
are
not
involved.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
only
to
this
extent,
this
court
considered
the
fact
that
in
beth
israel,
and
it's
has
been
considered
in
many
other
cases.
there
were
not
places
or
sufficient
places
for
people
to
communicate
with
respect
to
section
7
rights,
things
of
this
sort.
but
in
this
case
the
record
shows
that
there
are
26
nurses'
stations,
28
utility
rooms
that
have
coffee
machines
and
some
of
them
may
use
break
areas,
employee
lounges
i
believe
two
with
vending
machines,
the
laundry
building,
maintenance
building,
employees'
restrooms
and
the
parking
lot
which
are
available
for
solicitation
in
this
case.
so
it's
an
entirely
different
record
from
what
we
had
in
baptist
hospital.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
pardon?
i
mean
in
beth
israel.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
solicitation?
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
say
not.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
that
particular
set
of
facts
has
not
brought
up.
i
can't
answer
you
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
your
honor,
i
view
a
discussion
between
two
people
as
a
little
bit
differently
as
when
i
view
solicitation
as
such.
solicitation
involves
an
individual
going
from
one
person
to
another
solicit
to
take
some
action
and
this
case
with
respect
to
the
union.
but
the
record
is
clear
and
the
doctors
did
not
distinguish
between
union
solicitation
or
any
other
form
of
solicitation
or
conduct
which
would
simply
be
unprofessional
in
their
view.
i
would
distinguish
if
two
people
simply
having
conversation
but
in
terms
of
distributing
union
cards,
in
terms
of
going
around
soliciting
people
to
join
them,
let's
go
to
the
meeting
tomorrow
night
which
could
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
not
in
those
areas
accessible
to
the
public
in
the
hospital,
sir.
there
are
other
areas
which
will
be
available
for
that
purpose
but
not
in
those
areas
that
are
accessible
to
the
public.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
nurses'
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
the
nurses'
stations,
the
utility
rooms,
the
two
employee
lounges
where
one
is
a
cafeteria
type
lounge
that
have
vending
machines,
seats
approximately
50
people,
another
one
seats
25
to
30
and
apparently
in
the
entire
maintenance
building
at
least
after
the
testimony
and
the
laundry
building
is
also
in
the
testimony,
employee
restrooms
and
the
parking
lot.
now,
there
are
some
50
odd
locations
where
these
activities
can
take
place
that
are
not
accessible
to
the
public.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
laundry
building
is
what
they
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
not
a
great
deal.
our
record
as
it
is
--
the
ideal
place
to
solicit.
but
then
again
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
point
to
this
court.
we're
not
here
and
i
don't
think
the
union
is
entitled
to
say
we
are
entitled
to
ideal
circumstances
to
carry
on
our
activities.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
that's
right.
i
mean,
there's
must
be
an
accommodation.
after
all,
we're
talking
about
a
hospital.
we're
talking
about
patients
and
if
you
a
had
sick
one
in
the
hospital,
i'm
sure
you
will
realize
if
they
are
truly
sick
just
overhear
two
nurses
talking
about
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
go
the
beach
the
next
day.
it's
irritating
and
upsetting
to
a
person
who's
sitting
and
wondering
if
they
are
going
to
live
or
die
or
something
is
seriously
wrong
with
him.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
testimony
of
the
doctors
was
that
any
type
of
conduct
or
conversation
which
was
unprofessional
or
would
show
the
patient
or
the
patient
might
be
led
to
believe
that
these
people
are
more
concerned
with
something
rather
than
patient
care
or
need
would
be
upsetting
to
a
patient
and
they
did
not
distinguish
justice
marshall
between
patient's
stamina
or
a
patient.
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
well
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
i
suppose
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
well,
yes
and
no.
i
suppose
we
could
speculate
here
what
kind
of
conversations
would
be
permitted,
were
they
ordinary
average
conversation
between
--
mr.
fred
w.
elarbee,
jr.
alright
sir.
well,
what
were
they
talking
about
is
a
right
to
solicit
union
memberships
on
the
premises
and
the
board
recognizes
the
unsettling
effects
of
union
solicitation,
it
said
that
in
st.
john's.
given
that,
how
can
you
say
that
if
you
ought
to
be
limited
to
the
operating
room
or
the
patients'
room.
i
think
that
the
board
is
either
saying
one
of
two
things.
they
are
either
saying
that
it
would
not
have
unsettling
effects
in
other
places,
it's
either
saying
that
or
it's
either
saying
it
will
only
upset
a
few
and
therefore
we
should
allow
it.
i
don't
think
that's
an
acceptable
standard.
i
don't
believe
--
i
believe
i've
basically
covered
the
point
to
the
court.
i
urge
the
court
again
that
the
court
below
reviewed
the
record
and
found
that
in
so
far
as
the
board
had
concluded
that
the
hospital
here
showed
special
circumstances
that
the
board
limited
those
special
circumstances
to
the
immediate
patient
care
area,
the
court
below
specifically
found
that
is
not
the
evidence
in
this
record,
and
so
there
was
no
justification
for
the
board
concluding
in
the
fact
of
this
case
that
it
should
be
limited
to
“immediate
patient-care
areas”
and
i
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
below
which
i
believe
to
be
correct,
your
honor.
