justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
come
doesn't
this
case,
i
know
you
said
it
but
doesn't
this
case
involve
the
corridor
at
least
to
this
extent
even
though
the
solicitation
was
not
in
the
corridor,
the
board's
order,
if
one
reads
it
one
way,
does
prohibit
solicitation
in
the
corridor,
if
one
reads
it
another
way,
it
doesn't.
and
i
read
it
frankly
to
prohibit
solicitation
in
the
corridor
because
i
thought
the
board
didn't
treat
corridor
as
patient
care
areas.
i
think
that's
what
mr.
justice
powell
was
asking
you
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
substantial
testimony
in
this
case,
mr.
come,
about
the
corridors
and
the
use
to
which
they
were
put.
