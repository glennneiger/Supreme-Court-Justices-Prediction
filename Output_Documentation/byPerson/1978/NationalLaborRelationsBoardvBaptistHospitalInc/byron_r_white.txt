the

is
the
board
still
applying
the

its

to
corridors
in
any
hospitals
after
the

in
the

or

in
some
other
circuits,
what

justice

white
what
about
the
general
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
could
a
patient
make
an
appointment
with
his
insurance
broker
to
meet
him
in
the
cafeteria
say
if
he
needs
some
insurance
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
in
the
sitting
room
just
a
place
to
--
a
place
where
patient
--
the
only
place
the
patient
can
probably
talk
to
somebody
outside?
i
suppose
you
can
make
it
--
i
suppose
you
can
make
appointment
with
your
brother
to
visit
with
him
and
the
next
half
hour,
you
say
you
couldn't
have
--
be
chatting
with
your
insurance
agent..
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
he's
in
the
ward
a
fortiori,
he
couldn't
invite
him
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
show
that
suppose
it
makes
any
difference,
if
it's
30%,
10%
patients
in
the
cafeteria
or
60%.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
would
suggest
that
we
were
wrong
in
beth
israel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
very
far
though
on
this
argument
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't
go
very
far
with
this
on
beth
israel,
making
this
argument
you're
making
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
patients
don't
use
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case
or
the
rationale
of
this
case
if
there
aren't
any
patients
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
employees,
is
there
a
rule
against
employees
talking
with
each
other
about
whether
or
not
to
join
a
union
just
to
get
away
from
this
word
solicitation?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
may
employees
talk
about
and
get
into
an
argument
about
that?
neither
--
none
of
them
is
a
solicitor
for
a
union
but
they
are
just
arguing
pro
and
con
union.
can
they
--
are
they
suppose
to
do
that
in
the
restroom
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
say
not.
does
the
rule
forbid
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
you
get
into
the
big
argument
in
the
cafeteria
about
whether
ought
to
be
a
united
fund
or
separate
fund
drives
for
red
cross?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
employee
can't
--
couldn't
circulate
a
petition
in
an
election,
not
a
union
election,
but
couldn't
get
to
have
â€“-
to
get
signatures
to
put
somebody
on
a
ballot
for
city
council?
