harry

blackmun
now,
mr.
come,
what
significance
is
your
reference
to
special
permission?
of
course
that's
routine
in
the
hospital.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
just
wonder
why
are
you
emphasizing
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
wouldn't
a
special
permission
to
be
relevant
to
the
question
whether
patients
who
went
to
the
cafeteria
were
at
least
thought
to
be
well
enough
to
associate
with
the
public
as
opposed
to
secret
people.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
board
apply
rules
to
nurse
stations?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
i'm
going
to
ask
your
opposition
why
but
does
the
board
apply
its
rules
to
nurse
station?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what's
the
board's
attitude
about
nurse
stations,
if
any?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
take
it
then
to
constant
care
area
which
is
becoming
more
and
more
popular,
probably
the
board
would
be
fairly
lenient
there.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
absolutely.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
going
to
mention
nurses'
station
situation
at
this
hospital
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
just
wondered
whether
you
thought
that
was
consistent
with
your
position
on
after
the
cafeteria
and
other
places.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
i.
not
i
in
the
hospitals
i
know
of.
