these
cases
you
refer
to
were
not
hospital
cases,
were
they?
chief

warren
e.

don't
you
think
there's
quite
a
difference
between
a
factory
or
something
of
that
kind
in
a
hospital
or
a
hotel?
do
you
suggest
if
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
solicitations

take
place
in
the

a
hotel?
chief

you
moved
in
to
the
cafeteria.
i'm
talking
about
public
areas
of
a
hospital
that
would
correspond
somewhat
to
the
public
areas
of
a
hotel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
they
can
just
--
they
can
solicit
without
any
interference
with
working
functions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
mr.
come
is
willing
to
give
you
his
time?

you've
covered
those
points
so
far.

warren
e.
burger
well,
as
a
defector,
you're
familiar

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
patient
wants
to
see
his
insurance
agent,
he
can
invite
him
to
his
room
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
any
patients
out
on
the
parking
lot
very
often,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
which
ones
do
you
mean,
the
locker
room
and
the
parking
lot?
chief

which
ones?
chief
