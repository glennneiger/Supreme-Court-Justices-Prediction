restrict
this
to
a
nonworking
area
and
nonworking
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
both?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
let's
get
close
to
the
home.
can
a
lawyer
go
and
see
his
client
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
write
a
will?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
closer
to
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
we
can
draw
a
line
between
the
operating
room
and
the
parking
lot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
mean,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
in
beth
israel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
laundry,
can
you
hear
anything
in
the
laundry
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
hear
anything
--
have
you
ever
been
in
laundry
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
been
able
to
hear
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
there
are
some
people
that
have
been
in
a
hospital
and
hearing
nurses
talking
about
when
they
are
going
to
get
their
promotion
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
union
but
that's
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
am
worried
about
is
that
they
decide
what
is
good
conversation
and
what
is
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
think
some
people
don't
like
other
people
deciding
what
they
should
talk
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
that.
