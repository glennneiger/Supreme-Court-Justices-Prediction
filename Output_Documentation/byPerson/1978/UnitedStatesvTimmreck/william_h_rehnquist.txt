justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
was
there
anything
said
in
hill
about
prejudice?
i
had
read
hill
to
simply
mean
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
for
which
you
can
have
collateral
relief,
period.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
--
is
it
because
the
nature
of
the
fundamental
defect
is
such
that
the
defect
will
inevitably
in
every
case
result
in
a
denial
of
justice
or
is
it
a
question
of
prejudice
case
by
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
way
you
read
hill?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
just
can't
have
collateral
review
on
it
for
a
rule
32
violation
no
matter
how
badly
you
are
prejudiced
by
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
include
stone
against
powell
along
with
hill
and
davis,
in
stone
against
powell
there
was
a
clear
claim
of
a
constitutional
violation
that
would,
except
for
some
other
rule
be
cognizable
on
2255,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
one
were
sentenced
to
10
consecutive
terms
in
open
court,
he
wouldn't
start
actually
serving
the
10th
consecutive
term,
say
of
5
years
for
45
years.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
a
strange
colloquy
to
say
for
the
--
this
is
--
for
the
district
court
to
say,
are
you
aware
of
the
consequences
of
your
guilty
plea?
and
for
the
defendant
to
say,
no.
and
neither
the
judge
nor
any
of
the
two
lawyers
present
say
anything.
is
that
what
happened?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
is
that
all
we
have
to
go
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
i'm
concerned
of
is
not
what
this
court
was
doing
but
what
the
district
court
was
doing,
what
you
were
doing,
and
what
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
was
doing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
can
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
can
see
that,
but
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
somewhere
in
the
record
there
is
a
q
and
an
a.
and
the
q
is
from
the
district
judge's,
he
says,
are
you
aware
of
the
consequences
of
your
plea?
and
the
a
is,
no,
i
am
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
nothing
further
was
said
by
either
of
the
judge
or
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
judge
didn't
look
at
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
judge
just
didn't
leave
it
hanging
after
your
--
the
client
responded
"no."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
of
the
time
your
client
was
sentenced,
was
there
an
obligation
on
the
district
court
in
taking
a
guilty
plea
to
advice
the
defendant
that
he
had
the
right
to
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
hope
not.
