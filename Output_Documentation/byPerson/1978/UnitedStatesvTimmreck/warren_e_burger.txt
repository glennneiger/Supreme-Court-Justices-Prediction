we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
timmreck.
mr.
geller,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
failure
to
inform?
assume
a
failure
to
inform
the
client
before
the
rule
11
hearing
that
the
minimum
mandatory
was
three
years
before
parole
could
be
considered,
would
the
failure
to
inform
the
client
of
that
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
a
whole
record
of
this
kind
of
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
representation
at
least
as
the
district
judge
construed
it
was
that
the
represent
--
that
the
defense
counsel
had
represented
that
he
had
informed
his
client
with
all
these
elements,
was
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
--
is
there
in
effect
a
fact
finding
that
was
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
not
a
line
of
civil
cases
with
respect
to
wills
and
to
some
extent,
some
of
them
notarial
acknowledgments
that
years
after
the
event
where
the
notary
or
the
witness
to
a
will
cannot
have
any
--
and
he
says
he
does
not
have
any
personal
recollection
of
the
event
but
that
his
practice
was
never
to
sign
a
will
unless
he
saw
the
testator
sign
it
or
never
to
take
an
acknowledgment
unless
the
person
personally
appeared
before
him.
that
line
of
cases
is
that
the
testimony
as
to
general
practice
is
sufficient
to
carry
the
day.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
apply
that?
do
you
think
that's
equally
applicable
to
a
criminal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
geller.
mr.
mogill.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
we
free
to
rely
on
the
colloquy
that's
in
the
record,
the
(voice
overlap)
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
don't
contend
that
this
transcript
is
inaccurate
in
any
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
district
judge's
finding
that
he
was
informed
--
was
not
permissible
under
your
representation
that
that
was
your
practice
to
inform
the
client
and
--
but
that
you
didn't
have
any
independent
recollection
at
the
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
in
effect
made
a
--
such
a
finding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
concluded
that
the
--
that
your
--
that
you
had
adequately
informed
your
client.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
as
you
say
he
responded
that
he
did
not
understand
fully
and
the
judge
told
him
he
was
subject
to
a
15
year
imprisonment,
what
was
your
obligation
to
the
court
at
that
time
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
your
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
your
obligation
to
the
court
and
to
your
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
ever
raised
at
any
stage
or
has
it
been
suggested
at
any
stage
that
there
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
your
part?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
recommend
to
your
client
that
that
was
one
issue
that
could
be
raised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
where
does
that
obligation
arise
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
obligation
of
counsel
to
give
the
client
full
advice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
a
constitutional
issue,
effective
assistance
of
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
it
arises
out
of
the
relationship
of
client
and
counsel
and
linked
with
the
constitutional
sixth
amendment
right,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
represented
at
page
9
when
the
court
said
to
you,
"mr.
mogill,
are
you
of
the
opinion
there's
a
factual
basis
for
this
plea?"
and
you
answered
"yes,
i
am."
"and
that
your
client
knows
full
well
the
consequences
of
a
guilty
plea
might
be?"
"that's
correct."
you
were
surely
representing
to
the
court
there
affirmatively,
not
by
inference
but
affirmatively,
that
you
had
fully
--
full
well
informed
your
client
of
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
two
years
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
time
of
the
rule
11
hearing,
which
is
the
fulcrum
there,
you
--
it's
perfectly
clear
that
you
represented
to
the
courts
that
your
client
had
been
fully
informed.
and
it
does
not
do
for
me,
individually,
as
a
member
of
the
court
to
have
you
say
the
record
speaks
for
itself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
colloquy
that
i'm
referring
to
conceivably
might
have
at
least
raised
the
question
in
your
mind
whether
you
could
appropriately
continue
to
represent
this
man
without
letting
some
other
counsel
come
in
and
raise
the
question
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
which
might
or
might
not
be
a
stronger
case
being
a
constitutional
violation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mogill.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
said
that
based
upon
your
representations
at
the
bottom
of
page
9
to
the
court
notwithstanding
any
other
views
that
the
solicitor
general
might
have
about
it,
based
on
that
there
was
a
finding.
the
judge
said,
"i
find
on
this
record."
there
was
a
finding
and
that
that
finding
is
not
clearly
erroneous.
then,
you
wouldn't
have
any
open
door
to
the
kind
that
you've
been
suggesting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
just
said
that
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
said
on
the
basis
of
what
you
told
him,
"i
find
on
this
record."
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
apply
to
this
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
mogill.
mr.
geller,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
