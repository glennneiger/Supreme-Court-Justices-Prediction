i
take
it
then
if
the
claim
was
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel,
you'd
have
a
different
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
procedural
default?
certainly,
pleading
guilty
doesn't
waive
inadequate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
can
it
--
inadequate
counsel
claim,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
procedural
default
would
bar
a
--inadequate?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
until
they
--
not
if
they
took
it
back
to
the
state
courts
and
exhaust
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you've
exhausted
it
in
the
state
courts,
you've
exhausted
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
he
didn't
testified
that
he
informed
him
specifically
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
said,
generally,
his
practice
is
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
had
no
specific
recollection
of
advising
this
person
of
this
particular
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
devastating
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
next
page
--
on
that
couple
of
pages,
you
took
that
back.
you
said
that
if
you
failed
--
that
you
really
didn't
mean
to
represent
that
you
remembered
that
he
had
--
that
you
had
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
it,
unless
his
attorney
advises
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
reasonable
to
infer
that
if
there
had
been
a
dramatic
difference
between
the
actual
sentence
and
the
anticipated
sentence,
that
that
proposition
would've
been
considered?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
there
been
cases
holding
that
the
failure
to
advice
about
this
particular
special
parole
provision
is
a
violation
of
rule
11?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
doesn't
--
can't
concede
what
the
rule
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
rule
11.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
government
wins
this
case,
wouldn't
it
also
win
the
case
where
the
defendant
wasn't
advised
at
all
of
the
sentence
and
pleaded
guilty,
no
appeal,
collateral
attack
saying
he
wasn't
advised
of
the
sentence
at
all
in
violation
of
rule
11?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
mr.
geller,
is
that
--
when
you're
talking
about
prejudice
and
whether
he
would've
pleaded
guilty
anyway,
are
you
talking
about
the
time
he
was
in
court
before
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
its
still
automatic
answer
to
you
--
for
you
against
the
defendant
if
a
week
ago
he
was
told
about
the
parole
term?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
is
there's
no
obligation
to
advice
about
the
consequences
of
violating
a
parole.
justice
byron
r.
white
yet.
