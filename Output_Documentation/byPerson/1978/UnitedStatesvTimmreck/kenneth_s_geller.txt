mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
issue
is
whether
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
collateral
relief
from
his
conviction
under
28
u.s.c.
2255
merely
because
the
district
judge
failed
to
follow
the
formal
requirements
of
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
in
accepting
his
guilty
plea.
we
believe
that
under
this
court's
consistent
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
for
non-constitutional
errors,
respondent
was
not
entitled
to
section
2255
relief
as
a
result
of
this
violation
of
the
rule
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
erred
in
reversing
the
district
court's
order
denying
the
writ.
the
facts
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
follows.respondent
was
one
of
22
defendants
named
in
a
narcotics
conspiracy
indictment
filed
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
in
may
1972.
after
extensive
plea
bargaining,
respondent
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to
the
conspiracy
count
of
the
indictment.
in
return,
the
government
agreed
to
drop
the
remaining
17
substantive
counts
and
also
agreed
not
to
pursue
an
unrelated
bail
jumping
charge
against
him.
the
district
court
then
conducted
a
rule
11
proceeding
at
which
it
questioned
respondent
prior
to
determining
whether
to
accept
his
plea.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
court's
inquiry
at
this
proceeding
fully
complied
with
rule
11
in
every
respect
except
one.
although
the
court
mentioned
that
if
respondent
pleaded
guilty
he
could
be
sentenced
to
15
years
imprisonment
and
a
5
--
and
$25,000
fine.
the
court
neglected
to
add
that
responded
could
all
--
would
also
be
subject
to
a
mandatory
special
parole
term
of
at
least
three
years.
four
months
later,
respondent
was
sentenced
to
10
years
in
prison,
5
years
special
parole,
and
to
a
$5,000
fine.
now,
respondent
did
not
appeal
his
conviction
nor
during
the
following
two
years
did
he
signal
his
displeasure
with
any
other
aspect
of
his
plea
in
any
way.
in
august
1976
however,
respondent
moved
to
vacate
his
sentence
under
section
2255,
alleging
for
the
first
time
that
the
district
court
had
violated
rule
11
in
it
--
by
failing
to
mention
the
special
parole
term
at
the
time
of
his
plea.
motion
is
set
out
at
page
11
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
alleges
only
that
rule
11
was
violated.
it
doesn't
expressly
state
that
respondent
was
actually
unaware
of
the
special
parole
provisions
when
he
pleaded
guilty
and
more
important,
it
doesn't
claim
that
respondent
wouldn't
have
entered
the
exact
same
guilty
plea
if
the
judge
had
notified
him
on
the
record
of
the
special
parole
requirement.
in
fact,
the
motion
doesn't
allege
that
respondent
was
prejudiced
in
any
way
by
a
violation
of
the
rule.
and
the
same
can
be
said
for
respondent's
allegations
in
his
memorandum
in
support
of
his
motion
which
is
set
out
beginning
at
page
14
of
the
appendix
and
the
oral
argument
that
the
hearing
on
that
motion
which
begins
at
page
18
of
the
joint
appendix.
no
allegation
of
actual
prejudice.
now,
the
district
court
denied
respondent's
2255
motion.
the
court
acknowledged
that
it
hadn't
complied
fully
with
rule
11
in
taking
respondent's
plea
but
it
concluded
that
respondent
had
--
respondent
hadn't
been
harmed
in
any
way
by
the
technical
error
and
that
he
therefore
was
entitled
to
section
2255
relief.
the
court
noted
that
there
were
strong
indications
in
the
record
that
respondent
had
been
informed
by
his
attorney
of
the
consequences
of
his
plea
prior
to
pleading
guilty.
but
that
even
if
he
hadn't
in
light
of
all
the
factors
involved
in
the
plea
bargain,
knowledge
of
the
special
parole
provisions
wouldn't
have
influenced
respondent's
decision
to
plea
guilty.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
with
instructions
to
vacate
respondent's
conviction
and
to
allow
him
to
plead
anew.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
dispute
any
of
the
district
court's
fact
findings
but
it
held
relying
primarily
on
this
court's
decision
in
mccarthy
against
the
united
states
that
since
rule
11
had
been
violated,
respondent
was
automatically
entitled
to
withdraw
his
plea
without
regard
to
whether
he
was
actually
prejudiced
by
the
defect
or
whether
he
had
raised
the
rule
11
violation
on
direct
appeal
or
on
collateral
attack.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
for
me
to
begin
my
discussion
by
explaining
the
limits
of
the
government's
submission
in
this
case.
we
certainly
don't
contend
that
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
is
there
ever
foreclosed
from
ever
attacking
his
guilty
plea.
defendant
has
a
number
of
adequate
remedies.
he
can
move
to
withdraw
his
plea
before
sentencing
and
under
rule
32
(d),
withdrawal
for
virtually
any
reason
is
to
be
freely
allowed
at
that
stage.
and
after
sentence
has
been
imposed,
the
defendant
may
appeal
his
conviction
and
may
of
course
raise
any
objections
he
may
have
to
the
plea
taking
procedure
or
to
the
plea
itself.
and
even
after
the
time
for
appeal
has
run
and
the
conviction
has
become
final,
a
defendant
unquestionably
may
always
attack
his
conviction
collaterally
under
section
2255
if
the
plea
was
involuntary
or
otherwise
constitutionally
defective.
our
contention
here
is
simply
that
a
defendant
who
foregoes
all
of
these
remedies
is
not
entitled
to
collateral
relief
from
his
conviction.
often
as
in
this
case,
years
after
his
guilty
plea
when
all
that
he
can
show
is
that
some
portion
of
rule
11
was
not
complied
with
when
his
plea
was
accepted.
we
believe
that
on
collateral
attack
there
must
also
be
some
showing
of
substantial
prejudice
to
the
defendant
either
in
the
sense
that
the
rule
11
error
materially
affected
the
defendant's
decision
to
plead
guilty
or
because
for
any
other
reason
it
would
be
manifestly
unjust
to
hold
him
to
his
plea.
this
standard
of
collateral
review
of
non-constitutional
errors
is
one
that
this
court
has
frequently
applied.
and
perhaps
the
case
closest
in
point
is
hill
against
the
united
states
in
368
u.s.
that
case
like
this
one
involved
a
motion
to
vacate
sentence
under
section
2255
by
a
defendant
who
claimed
that
his
conviction
had
been
entered
in
violation
of
a
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
the
rule
involved
there
was
rule
32
(a)
which
gives
a
defendant
an
absolute
right
to
make
a
statement
prior
to
sentencing.
although
the
court
acknowledged
in
hill
that
the
right
guaranteed
to
defendant
by
rule
32
(a)
was
an
important
one
and
that
the
defect
would've
required
vacation
of
the
defendant's
sentence
if
it
had
been
raised
on
direct
appeal,
the
court
denied
collateral
relief,
saying
that
the
error
was
not
a
fundamental
defect
that
inherently
results
in
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
court
could
have
decided
hill,
i
think,
on
the
ground
that,
not
having
appealed,
hill
was
foreclosed
from
getting
collateral
relief.
but
it
went
on.
it
didn't
go
off
on
that
ground.
it
went
on
to
discuss
what
the
requirements
are
for
getting
collateral
relief
for
a
non-constitutional
plea
and
it
set
forth
the
standard
that
we
rely
on
here
which
is
that
there
must
be
a
fundamental
defect
that
inherently
results
in
a
substantial
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
there
must
be
a
case
by
case
determination.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
hill
says
that
on
the
--
for
a
rule
32
error,
the
only
remedy
is
a
direct
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
except,
i
suppose,
in
the
situation
of
a
change
in
law
such
as
in
the
davis
situation.
that
made
that
to
limited
exception
but
otherwise
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
the
court
added
in
hill
that
collateral
relief
as
i
said,
is
not
available
in
that
type
of
situation.
and
the
same
statements
that
the
court
made
in
hill
were
repeated
even
more
recently
in
the
davis
case
in
417
u.s.
and
again
in
stone
against
powell.
in
light
of
these
decisions,
we
think
it's
rather
clear
that
respondent's
claim
which
as
the
district
court
noted
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
the
assertion
that
rule
11
was
violated
when
he
pleaded
guilty
is
not
cognizable
under
section
2255.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
there
were
other
reasons
aside
from
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
which
led
the
court
--
stone
against
powell
not
to
grant
the
writ
--
reasons
that
related
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
that
would
be
a
constitutional
error
that
--
assuming
there
was
no
procedural
default
which
would
prevent
its
being
raised
on
collateral
attack,
we
concede
would
be
--
section
2255
relief
would
be
available.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
assume
not.
inadequacy
of
counsel
claim
has
never
been
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
assume
if
the
new
counsel
handled
an
appeal
and
decided
not
--
for
whatever
reason,
decided
not
to
raise
inadequacy
of
counsel
at
trial
on
the
direct
appeal
that
might
preclude
habeas
corpus
relief
later
on.
but
that
again
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
when
you're
dealing
with
2254
relief,
there
may
be
questions
of
comity
but
i
think
in
section
2255
that
absence
of
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right,
but
if
there
is
cause
for
not
raising
the
issue
on
direct
appeal
then
there
may
be
--
that
may
be
allowable
to
raise
the
section
on
22
--
raise
the
claim
on
section
2254
or
2255.
but
that
of
course
is
the
rule
in
cases
of
constitutional
errors
and
the
court
has
always
drawn
a
distinction
between
a
constitutional
and
non-constitutional
error
as
far
as
the
availability
of
collateral
attack.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
hesitate
to
answer
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
think
not.
not
as
--
that's
our
argument
here,
essentially
that
what's
important
is
whether
the
defendant
would
have
pleaded
guilty
nonetheless.
if
he
would
have,
even
if
he
had
been
given
this
advice
which
he
says
he
was
not
given,
then
we
don't
see
how
he
has
been
prejudiced
and
in
the
absence
of
prejudice
he's
not
entitled
to
collateral
relief.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
the
district
court
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
one
of
the
grounds
we
rely
on.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
that's
correct.
there
are
--
they
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
are
two
things
that
petitioner
of
course
rely
on.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct
but
although
the
district
court
relied
on
two
separate
statements
by
defense
counsel.
one
was
a
statement
at
the
rule
11
proceeding
itself
that
he
had
advised
his
--
that
he
was
--
of
the
view
that
his
client
was
aware
of
the
consequences
of
his
plea.
and
then
the
second
statement
is
the
one
that
you
just
referred
to
justice
white,
which
is
at
the
section
2255
hearing
a
few
years
later
when
counsel
said
that
it
was
his
practice
before
allowing
a
client
to
plead
guilty
to
advice
that
client
of
the
consequences
of
the
plea
although
he
couldn't
say
whether
in
this
particular
case,
two
years
or
so
having
past,
he
had
actually
done
so.
but
there
were
two
separate
statements
by
counsel
that
the
district
court
relied
on
in
inferring
that
respondent
actually
knew
of
the
special
parole
term.
but
that
wasn't
the
only
string
to
the
district
court's
bow
and
it's
not
ours.
we
also
alleged
that
respondent
would
not
have
changed
his
plea
from
not
--
from
guilty
to
not
guilty
if
he
had
been
informed
of
the
special
parole
term.
the
district
court
make
that
finding
also
and
we
think
that
that
finding
which
respondent
has
never
challenged
is
amply
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
agree
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
it
is
of
probative
value
that
defense
counsel
stated
at
the
section
2255
hearing
that
it
was
his
practice
not
to
allow
a
client
to
plead
guilty
before
making
certain
that
that
client
was
aware
of
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
and
i
think
it
was
certainly
open
to
the
district
court
to
take
that
into
account
than
making
the
fact
finding
which
we
rely
on
here.
now,
as
i
mentioned
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
you'd
have
to
engage
in
the
same
sort
of
inquiry
we
suggest
here
which
is,
that
if
the
defendant
had
not
been
told
of
his
ineligibility
for
parole.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
don't
say
that
there
--
there
would
not
be
a
per
se
rule.
you
would
have
to
make
a
determination
whether
--
oh,
excuse
me,
i
am
to
assume
that
he
wouldn't
have
pleaded
guilty
if
he
had
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
oh,
assuming
that
he
had
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
the
rule
--
we
--
you
would
still
have
to
engage
in
the
case
by
case
analysis
that
we
suggest
here
on
collateral
attack
to
determine
whether
that
defendant
if
he
had
been
told
that
he
was
ineligible
for
parole
would've
changed
this
plea
from
guilty
to
not
guilty.
i
think
that
arose
in
a
number
of
seventh
circuit
cases.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
when
the
question
is
--
has
rule
11
been
violated.
certainly,
rule
11
requires
the
district
court
to
tell
the
defendant
certain
things,
but
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
would
be
a
violation
of
rule
11.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
on
collateral
attack,
certainly
it's
exceedingly
important
what
the
defendant
knew
and
not
who
told
him
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
prejudice
in
holding
him
to
his
guilty
plea.
certainly
it
would
be
exceedingly
relevant
if
--
although
the
district
court
violated
rule
11
in
not
telling
the
defendant
certain
things
his
attorney
told
him
that
information,
certainly.
but,
as
i
mentioned
here
respondent
has
never
alleged
that
he
wouldn't
have
pleaded
guilty
if
he
had
known
about
the
special
parole
term.
and
the
district
court
expressly
found
that
the
rule
11
error
had
no
effect
on
its
decision
to
enter
his
plea.
and
this
fact
finding
certainly
supported
by
the
evidence,
respondent
obtained
the
dismissal
of
17
serious
narcotics
counts
and
a
bail
jumping
charge
by
pleading
guilty
to
the
one
count
in
this
case
and
he
unquestionably
knew
that
his
guilty
plea
could
result
in
a
sentence
to
about
15
years
in
prison
and
a
$25,000
fine.
i
might
also
add
in
this
regard
that
at
the
time
the
respondent
pleaded
guilty
several
of
his
codefendants
were
undergoing
a
trial
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
at
which
the
government
was
presenting
devastating
evidence
against
them,
evidence
that
would've
been,
i
think,
equally
probative
of
respondent's
guilt.
that
also,
i'm
sure,
entered
into
respondent's
decision
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--
to
plead
--
yes,
it
is,
during
the
section
2255
hearing.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
well,
actually,
the
court
does
make
certain
statements
during
the
rule
11
proceeding
about
how
the
trial
was
going
on
at
the
moment
and
either
in
that
proceeding
or
in
the
section
2255
hearing
he
does
make
certain
statements
about
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence
that
was
being
introduced
at
that
trial.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
judge
was
trying
that
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
so,
like
the
district
court
in
light
of
these
factors,
we
think
it's
exceedingly
improbable
that
that
respondent
would've
changed
his
mind
about
the
plea
bargain
if
he
had
been
informed
that
he
could
also
be
sentenced
to
a
term
of
special
parole
which
would
not
have
any
appreciable
effects
upon
him
unless
he
were
years
later
to
violate
the
conditions
of
the
parole.
moreover,
there's
no
manifest
in
justice
in
holding
respondent
to
this
guilty
plea.
as
i
just
mentioned,
respondent
knew
he
--
when
he
pleaded
guilty
that
he
could
be
sentenced
up
to
15
years
imprisonment.
and
his
eventual
sentence
of
10
years
imprisonment
plus
5
years
special
parole
is
therefore
no
greater
for
practical
purposes.
it's
substantially
less
than
he
was
told
he
could
receive.
even
if
respondent
violates
the
conditions
of
the
special
parole
and
the
parole
commission
determines
to
send
him
back
to
prison
for
that
5-year
period
he
can't
serve
more
than
the
15
years
in
prison
that
he
knew
was
his
exposure
when
he
pleaded
guilty.
now,
perhaps
the
most
important
reason
in
our
view
why
respondent
isn't
entitled
to
section
2255
relief
as
a
result
of
this
non-constitutional
violation
is
that
this
is
hardly
a
situation
where
as
the
court
said
in
hill,
the
need
for
the
remedy
afforded
by
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
apparent.
there's
no
reason
why
this
rule
11
defect
couldn't
have
been
raised
on
direct
appeal.
all
the
relevant
facts
relating
to
the
violation
are
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
record.
and
respondent
who
had
the
advice
of
counsel
should've
been
aware
at
the
time
of
sentencing
that
the
trial
judge
had
neglected
to
mention
the
special
parole
term
when
the
plea
was
taken.
this
is
especially
true
i
would
think
when
a
--
if
a
defendant's
ignorance
of
the
special
parole
term
truly
played
a
meaningful
role
in
his
decision
to
enter
the
guilty
plea.
there's
no
reason
why
a
defendant
such
as
respondent
should
be
allowed
to
forego
direct
appeal
and
to
wait
several
years
to
raise
a
claim
such
as
this.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
now
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
mccarthy
was
a
case
just
like
that.
guilt
--
it
was
a
direct
appeal
after
a
guilty
plea.
there's
no
bar
to
doing
it
if
the
violation
relates
to
the
plea
taking
procedures
itself
rather
than
some
antecedent
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
a
guilty
plea
waives
any
antecedent
constitutional
violations.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
you
can
take
an
appeal
although
you
won't
be
very
successful,
i
would
assume.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
fact
is
he
was
sentenced
to
a
special
parole
term.
so,
he
knew
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
he
had
the
advice
of
counting
--
assistance
of
counsel
this
time.
if
in
fact
he
pleaded
guilty
because
he
didn't
know
anything
about
a
special
parole
term
and
he
never
thought
he
would
be
exposed
to
one,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
should've
been
curious
about
what
it
was
when
he
was
sentenced
to
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
but
he
should've
been
aware
of
it
at
that
point
and
if
he
thought
he
got
sentenced
to
something
greater
than
he
had
bargained
for,
i
want
to
assume
he
would've
raised
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
true,
but
he
--
if
he
was
aware
of
it
at
that
point,
presumably
he
would--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right
but,
presumably
he
should
be
aware
at
that
moment
if
he's
been
given
a
greater
sentence
than
he
thought
he
was
exposing
himself
to
by
pleading
guilty.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
necessarily
disagree
with
any
of
the
ar
--
many
of
the
arguments
that
i've
just
made
about
the
scope
of
collateral
attack.
in
fact,
the
sixth
circuit
candidly
remarked
that
the
rule
11
violation
at
this
case
--
in
this
case
did
not
seem
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
?fundamental
defect
which
inherently
results
in
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice.?
nonetheless,
the
court
felt
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
relief
because
of
the
presumptive
prejudice
rule
of
mccarthy.
the
court
read
mccarthy
as
holding
that
a
rule
11
violation
is
per
se
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
and
thus
satisfies
the
hill
and
davis
test.
now,
we've
explained
in
our
brief
why
we
think
that
the
automatic
reversal
rule
of
mccarthy
which
was
announced
in
the
exercise
of
this
court's
supervisory
powers
rather
than
as
a
rule
of
constitutional
law
may
have
outlived
its
usefulness
especially
since
there's
now
a
new
version
of
rule
11
in
effect.
but,
whether
or
not
some
of
the
premises
of
mccarthy
should
now
be
reexamined
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
automatic
reversal
rule
has
no
place
in
a
motion
to
vacate
sentence
under
section
2255
where
the
sole
relevant
inquiry
is
whether
the
particular
defendant's
detention
is
unlawful.
mccarthy,
of
course,
was
a
direct
a
appeal
and
there's
nothing
in
the
court's
opinion
to
suggest
that
every
violation
of
rule
11
constitutes
the
sort
of
substantial
prejudice
or
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice
that
would
entitle
a
defendant
to
habeas
corpus
relief.
in
fact
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
you
can
but
i
think
what
you
have
to
confront
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
held
in
this
case
which
is
that
the
automatic
reversal
rule
that
this
court
promulgated
in
mccarthy
has
no
application
on
collateral
attack.
i
think
you'd
have
to
say,
which
is
what
we
suggest
the
correct
rule
is,
that
on
collateral
attack,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
presumptive
prejudice.
the
defendant
has
to
show
that
he
has
actually
been
prejudiced.
now,
i
think
if
the
court
adopts
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
he's
never
alleged
that
he
has
been.
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
except
as
i
say,
if
he
doesn't
have
to
prove
prejudice
to
be
entitled
to
relief
because
of
a
rule
11
violation,
which
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
we
think
this
court
should
reject
the
notion
that
on
collateral
attack
a
presumptive
prejudice
rule
should
apply
and
that
it
should
be
up
to
the
defendant
on
a
2255
motion
to
show
actual
prejudice
which,
as
i
agree
with
your
honor,
he
can't
do
in
this
case.
now,
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
strong
societal
interest
in
the
finality
of
judgments
in
criminal
cases
and
while
society
may
be
willing
to
incur
the
substantial
costs
associated
with
collateral
attacks
in
order
to
correct
or
--
errors
of
constitutional
magnitude
or
cases
where
a
prisoner
has
been
grievously
harmed
and
the
writ
is
the
only
effective
means
of
preserving
his
rights.
we
believe
that
a
contrary
result
is
clearly
dictated
in
cases
involving
non-constitutional
violations
especially
where
those
violations
could've
been
raised
on
direct
appeal.
since
the
rule
11
error
in
this
case
didn't
influence
respondent's
decision
to
plead
guilty
or
otherwise
lead
to
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice
we
believe
that
respondent
should've
raised
the
technical
violation
on
direct
appeal
or
not
at
all.
the
interest
of
justice
is
certainly
not
served
by
allowing
defendants
such
as
respondent's
unlimited
time
and
a
free
option
to
undo
their
convictions
by
establishing
a
non-prejudicial
omission
on
their
rule
11
inquiry.
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
view
therefore,
erred
in
holding
that
respondent
was
automatically
entitled
to
vacate
his
conviction
under
section
2255.
we
submit
that
accordingly,
this
court
should
reverse
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
didn't
mean
to
mislead
you
justice
stevens,
in
regard
to
my
answer
concerning
your
ineligibility
for
parole
hypothetical.
our
approach
would
be
exactly
the
same.
there
would
have
to
be
an
inquiry
on
col
--
if
it
were
raised
on
collateral
attack
into
whether
the
defendant
was
actually
prejudiced.
our
approach
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
the
approach
the
seventh
--
you
took
as
the
member
of
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right,
but
we're
--
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
it
would
be
automatic.
secondly,
i
think
that
the
notion
that
it's
either
not
feasible
or
not
seemly
to
inquire
into
prejudice
when
there's
been
a
defect
in
a
guilty
plea
proceeding
and
it's
raised
on
collateral
attack
is
rebutted
by
this
court's
decision
in
henderson
against
morgan
in
426
u.s.
which
was
a
case
of
a
defective
guilty
plea
proceeding.
everyone
agreed
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
had
not
been
told
about
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
to
which
he
pleaded
guilty
but
the
court
didn't
stop
there.
it
didn't
inquire
to
see
whether
he
might
have
had
that
information
from
somewhere
else.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
that's
correct.
and
you
have
to
measure
voluntariness
by
what
he
knew
at
the
time
he
pleaded
guilty
or
what
he
would've
done
at
the
time
he
pleaded
guilty
if
he
had
been
told
what
he
now
claims
he
should've
been
told.
and
subsequent
events
are
only
relevant,
i
think,
in
determining
whether
it's
fair
to
hold
him
to
his
plea
which
is
a
separate
sort
of
an
inquiry
although
an
equal
ground
for
allowing
collateral
attack.
the
final
thing
i
want
to
say
is
that
mr.
mogill
made
the
statement
a
moment
ago,
i
think
in
an
attempt
to
show
prejudice
for
the
first
time
since
this
motion
never
alleged
prejudice
that
his
client
could
be
in
prison
for
longer
than
he
was
told
or
at
least
subject
to
supervision
for
longer
than
he
was
told.
he
can't
serve
more
than
15
years
because
he
got
a
10-year
prison
sentence
and
a
5-year
special
parole
term.
even
if
he
began
to
serve
his
special
parole
term
and
after
two
or
three
years
he
violated
it,
he
couldn't
be
returned
to
prison
for
more
than
5
years
of
this
special
parole
term.
that's
not
unusual.
almost
every
defendant
could
make
the
same
claim.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right,
but
he
would
only
be
in
prison
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
he
couldn't
serve
more.
he
could
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--
under
supervision
for
it,
but
i
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
plus
four
years.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right,
but
that
could
happen
to
any
defendant.
let's
assume
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
to
a
15-year
felony,
it's
not
a
drug
case.
let's
assume
we
don't
have
a
special
parole
problem
and
he
gets
15
years
and
he's
told
he
could
get
15
years.
he
gets
15
years
presumably
no
rule
11
violation.
after
10
years,
he's
paroled.
he
then
begins
to
serve
his
5-year
parole
term.
after
three
years,
let's
assume
he
violates
the
conditions
of
his
parole.
the
parole
commission
could
send
him
back
to
prison
for
five
years.
so,
that
defendant
also
would
serve
15
years
in
prison
and
be
under
supervision
for
a
couple
of
extra
years.
no
one's
ever
suggested
that
those
sorts
of
nuances
have
to
be
explained
to
the
defendant.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no
one
has
suggested
that
that's
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yet.
thank
you.
