justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
before
you
go
on,
if
i
understand
the
government's
position
correctly
the
district
court
should
not
even
have
had
a
hearing
because
the
allegations
really
weren't
sufficient
to
raise
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
they
did
have
the
hearing
here.
and
you've
--
you
attach
weight
to
whether
he
would've
pleaded
guilty
or
not.
there
were
a
group
of
cases
about
10
years
ago
on
the
question
when
there
is
no
eligibility
for
parole
in
a
failure
--
i'm
sure
you've
read
some
of
those
cases,
failure
to
advice
the
defendant
of
ineligibility.
under
your
view,
would
that
be
ground
for
collateral
damage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
that,
violation
of
rule
11
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
just
say,
assume
that
he
was
not
advised.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore
a
violation
of
rule
11.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
we
never
put
it
off
on
that
ground
though.
we
didn't
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
say
that
anything
counsel
tells
him
the
judge
needn't
tell
him
even
though
rule
11
requires
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
yes
i
agree
there'd
--
that'd
be
a
violation
but
how
about
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
how
about
collateral
attacks?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
a
time
problem
too,
he'd
do
it
promptly.
but,
what
--
does
the
record
show
when
the
defendant
here
first
became
aware
of
the
special
parole
term?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
we
don't
know
whether
he
knew
it
before
the
time
of
appeal
had
run.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
if
it's
in
writing
he
may
--
you
know,
he
said
documents
are
rather
complicated
to
read
in
some
ways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
he
didn't
start
to
serve
it
right
away.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
just
said
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
he
became
aware
of
it
until
after
the
appeal
time
it
ran.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he
was,
we
don't
know
whether
he
was
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mogill,
your
statement
or
your
conclusion
that
he
did
not
know
about
the
mandatory
special
parole
term
is
based
on
his
statement
that
when
he
was
told
of
it
--
it
could
be
as
much
as
15
years
in
jail,
he
said
i
know
it
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
you
think
that
necessarily
forecloses
the
possibility
that
he
did
know
about
the
mandatory
special
parole
term?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
all
the
consequences?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
no,
it
doesn't
mean
he
didn't
know
about
any
of
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright,
but
anyway,
that's
what
your
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
but
mr.
mogill,
they
conceded
the
applicability
of
that
rule
in
the
sixth
circuit.
it
was
not
the
rule
on
other
circuits
in
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
it
wasn't
the
rule
in
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
one
other
feature,
mr.
mogill,
just
so
we
have
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
--
in
page
9
of
the
abstract,
you
were
asked
by
the
court
at
the
plea
hearing,
"are
you
of
the
opinion
there's
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea?"
and
you
said,
"yes."
and
then,
"and
that
your
client
knows
full
well
the
consequences
of
the
guilty
plea
might
be?"
"that's
correct."
so,
you
were
of
the
opinion
then
that
he
was
fully
advised?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
necessarily
because
you
could
have
advised
him
and
you're
statement
would
still
have
been
100%
accurate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
a
matter
of
what
we've
talked
about
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
seventh
circuit
agrees
with
you
on
this
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mogill,
mr.
geller
gave
precisely
the
ac
--
the
opposite
answer
to
that
question
when
i
asked
it
about
the
mandatory
failure
to
advice
about
ineligibility
for
parole.
he
said
there'd
be
a
different
case
because
there
might
be
prejudice.
at
least
that's
what
i
understood
him
to
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
mr.
justice
white's
example
is
even
farther
removed
than
that
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
i
may
be
right
that
the
court
would
rule
that
way,
probably
not
the
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
as
i
understand,
is
either
--
if
the
plea
is
either
involuntary
or
if
it's
fundamentally
unfair,
whatever
the
violation
was,
it
was
fundamentally
unfair,
then
collateral
attack
is
appropriate.
and
if
you
say
there's
no
advice
whatsoever
about
sentence
and
he
gets
put
away
for
20
years,
that
strikes
me
as
being
pretty
unfair.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think,
well,
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
you
concede,
i
understand
--
at
least
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
he
on
such
a
collateral
attack
prove
that
he
would
not
have
made
or
enter
the
plea
had
he
understood
it,
then
you
would
agree
that
was
fundamentally
unfair
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
the
collateral
attack
would
be
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
mean
automatic,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
you.
if
after
four
years
of
special
parole
he
violates
the
parole,
can
he
not
then
go
to
jail
for
five
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
he
could
serve
more
than
a
total
of
15.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
could
have
15
years
of
prison
time
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
plus
four
years
of
parole.
