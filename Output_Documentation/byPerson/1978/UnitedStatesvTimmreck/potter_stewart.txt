a
guilty
plea?

on
a
conviction
basically.
justice
potter
stewart
it
used
to
be
considered
a
little
odd
for
somebody
who
had
pleaded
guilty
and
been
found
--
and
had
been
convicted
on
the
basis
of
his
plea
of
guilty
immediately
to
take
an
appeal.
i
guess
it's
--
there's
no
problem
about
that
anymore,
is
there?
justice
potter

well,
is
there
any
bar
anyway?

grounds.
justice

well,
mr.
mogill,
if
the
trial
judge
had
asked
a
convicted
defendant,
"are
you
aware
of
the
consequences
of
--
or
a
guilty
pleading
defendant?"
are
you
aware
of
the
consequences
of
your
guilty
plea?"
and
defendant
had
said,
"yes,
i
am."
that
wouldn't
have
proved
--
been
any
indication
or
any
proof
that
he
was
in
fact,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
rule
imposes
a
duty
upon
the
trial
judge
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
advice
him
whatever
the
response
is,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
he
--
cause
even
if
the
defendant
says,
"yes,
i
am."
he
might
be
quite
misinformed
about
the
consequences.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
any
event,
the
government,
as
i
understand
it,
concedes
that
there
was
a
rule
11
violation
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
or
whether
or
not
he
knew
it
was
mandatory.
