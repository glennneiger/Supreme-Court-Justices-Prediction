mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
continuing
availability
of
section
2255
relief
to
persons
who
have
no
other
remedy
available
to
them
and
were
in
custody
in
consequence
of
police
taken
without
advice
of
the
full
penal
consequences
of
their
pleas.
also
at
issue
is
the
standard
of
review
to
be
applied
in
cases
raising
such
claims.
i
think
it's
important
initially
to
make
clear
that
the
statement
of
facts
offered
by
the
government
is
inadequate
and
it
does
not
fully
represent
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly,
and
i
would
like
briefly
however,
to
point
out
to
the
court
where
the
facts
offered
by
the
government
are
insufficient.
it
is
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly
not.
in
fact
i'm
relying
on
the
transcript
in
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
at
the
time
mr.
timmreck
offered
his
plea
he
specifically
affirmatively
stated
to
the
district
judge
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
consequences
of
his
plea.
the
district
judge
advised
mr.
timmreck
that
he
was
subject
to
a
potential
15
years
maximum
incarceration.
the
district
judge
did
not
advice
mr.
timmreck
that
a
mandatory
special
parole
term
of
three
years
must
be
applied,
if
a
custodial
sentence
were
imposed,
and
the
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
don't
think
the
district
judge
made
a
finding
that
mr.
timmreck
was
informed.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
he
concluded
that
--
well,
i
think
the
report
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
important
points
here
are
two.
one,
regardless
of
whether
i
informed
mr.
timmreck
of
the
mandatory
special
parole
term,
it
is
clear
that
at
the
time
he
offered
his
plea,
he
was
not
aware
of
it.
he
so
indicated
to
the
judge.
and
the
second
point
that
is
important,
and
its
part
of
the
reasoning
underlying
the
particular
requirements
of
rule
11
is
that
rule
11
is
designed
to
ensure
that
the
adequacy
of
the
record
of
voluntary
plea
appears
from
the
four
corners
of
the
record
of
the
plea
and
it
does
not
require
any
fact
finding
outside
that
record
in
it.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
my
obligation
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
my
obligation
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
both
of
us
candidly
apparently
missed
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
failed
to
advice
him.
had
i
caught
it,
it
would've
been
my
obligation
to
advice
the
court
that
it
failed
to
mention
that
a
mandatory
special
parole
term
of
at
least
three
years
and
possibly
up
to
life
was
to
be
imposed
in
the
event
of
a
custodial
sentence.
it
would
also
have
been
the
assistant
united
states
attorney's
obligation.
i
think
that
it's
important
for
the
court
to
note
that
both
parties
--
counsel
for
both
parties
inadvertently
for
the
same
reasons
as
the
district
judge
inadvertently
neglected
to
advice
respondent
of
the
mandatory
special
parole
term
but
that
in
fact,
that
did
occur
and
that
respondent
had
indicated
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
consequences.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
there
were
no
problems
in
terms
of
communication
with
my
client.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
indicating
the
time
period
involved
in
communication
between
counsel
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
have
no
present
recollection.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
but
the
record
indicates
that
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
as
the
record
reflects
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--
that
i
indicated
to
the
district
judge
that
i
do
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
have
no
recollection
whether
i
did.
the
important
point
is
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
not
if
my
client
didn't
know
regardless
of
whether
he
was
advised
by
counsel.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
not
necessarily.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
justice
marshall,
i
think
the
important
point
here
is
that
regardless
of
whether
he
is
advised
by
counsel
the
important
cons
--
the
important
inquiry
is
whether
he
was
advised
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea
and
whether
he
knew
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea.
the
fact
is
he
didn't
know
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea.
he
indicated
as
much
to
the
district
judge.
the
government
has
never
alleged
and
i
don't
take
it
to
be
alleging
now
that
anyone's
memory
is
conveniently,
you
know
lapsed
or
anything
like
that
and
i
--
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
suggest
that
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
--
and
immediately
prior
to
that
when
the
judge
asked
him,
?are
you
aware
of
the
consequences
of
your
plea??
he
affirmatively
said,
no.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
it
indicates
to
anyone
reading
that
record
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
consequences
of
his
plea.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
and
the
mandatory
special
parole
term
is
a
direct
consequence.
in
fact,
the
government
concedes
it
to
be
a
direct
consequence
of
the
plea.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
it
--
i
think
it
speaks
for
itself
and
whatever
interpretations
of
the
reader.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
again
the
record
speaks
for
itself
in
that
regard.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
believe
that
it
is
--
hopefully
what
the
court
will
be
doing
in
part
in
this
case
is
addressing
itself
to
the
standard
of
review
to
the
part
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
all
the
parties
were
interested
in
seeing
that
the
rule
11
proceeding
was
adequate.
the
district
judge,
i
assume
inadvertently
neglected
to
advice
mr.
timmreck
that
a
mandatory
special
parole
term
of
at
least
three
years
and
as
much
as
life
was
involved.
counsel
for
the
government
neglected
to
catch
the
error.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
defense
counsel
neglected
to
catch
the
error.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
--
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no.
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
the
judge
informed
mr.
timmreck
that
he
was
subject
up
to
15
years.
the
judge
did
not
say
that
if
a
custodial
sentence
was
imposed
for
the
violation
to
which
he
was
pleading
guilty,
there
must
also
be
a
mandatory
special
parole
term
of
at
least
three
years
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--
and
possibly
up
to
life.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no,
but
he
did
not
fully
inform
mr.
timmreck
and
in
fact
he
misled
him
by
failing
to
advice
him
of
the
mandatory
special
parole
term.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
correct
and
again
it
goes
to
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
rule
to
make
a
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
and
regardless
of
whether
counsel
has
advised
him
or
not.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
correct
or
if
he
was
--
even
if
he
was
accurately
informed,
the
district
judge
has
the
same
obligation.
in
fact
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
it
has
not
been.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
don't
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
do
not
believe
that
that
issue
came
up.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
however
that
at
the
time
the
petition
--
the
2255
petition
was
initially
filed
in
this
case,
the
government
conceded
the
applicability
of
a
sixth
circuit
case,
wolak,
and
virtually
conceded
the
merit
of
the
2255
petition.
the
argument
the
government
is
raising
today
was
filed
in
a
supplemental
--
it
was
first
raised
in
a
supplemental
memorandum
filed
the
day
before
or
rather
the
day
of
the
hearing.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no,
this
case
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
--
of
course.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i'm
sorry,
which
obligation?
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
as
a
part
of
counsel's
general
obligation
to
render
effective
assistance.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes,
the
purpose
of
rule
11,
one
of
the
purposes
of
rule
11
though
is
to
avoid
this
kind
of
inquiries,
is
to
ensure
that
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea
reflects
the
defendant
was
fully
advised
and
fully
--
and
made
a
fully
knowing
waiver.
so,
the
kind
of
collateral
inquiries
that
became
involved
in
this
case
are
unnecessary.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
clearly,
i
had
missed
the
fact
that
the
judge
had
missed
advising
mr
.timmreck
of
the
mandatory
special
parole
term.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
right,
but
even
if
it
was,
it
was
clear
that
mr.
timmreck
had
forgotten
that
or
didn't
know
or
hadn't
paid
any
attention
at
the
time
he
offered
his
plea.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
in
this
case
subjected
mr.
timmreck
to
a
potential
combined
custodial
and
parole
--
incarceration
and
parole
custody
of
ex
--
of
an
excess
of
15
years.
in
fact,
the
combined
sentence
here
subjected
him
to
a
possible
combined
custody
of
20
years
less
1
day
and
it
--
that
is
so
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
the
mandatory
special
parole
term.
mr.
timmreck
was
sentenced
to
10
years
in
custody
on
his
initial
sentence
and
five
years
mandatory
special
parole.
because
of
the
unique
provisions
of
the
mandatory
special
parole
term,
he
could
serve
4
years,
11
months
and
29
days
and
if
he
violated
on
the
last
day,
still
be
sentenced
to
5
years
--
the
full
5
years
in
custody.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
oh,
the
record
speaks
for
itself
in
that
regard.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
--
the
statement
to
which
you're
referring
to
mr.
justice
white
was
from
the
hearing
on
the
2255
and
yes,
i
would
agree
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well,
the
only
point
i
wish
to
make,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
i
have
no
specific
recollection
at
this
point
in
time
what
my
conversations
were
with
my
client.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes,
it
does.
yes
it
does.
with
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that
was
certainly
mr.
timmreck's
choice
and
he
chose
to
retain
me
on
the
2255
petition.
at
the
time
mr.
timmreck
was
sentenced
in
this
case
he
was
not
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
direct
appeal.
and
it
is
also
important
to
note
in
terms
of
this
court
being
fully
advised
of
the
facts
that
the
government
below,
not
only
initially
conceded
that
the
sixth
circuit
case,
wolak,
controlled
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
at
that
time.
but
also,
the
government
didn't
allege
that
mr.
timmreck
would
have
continued
with
his
plea
had
he
been
advised
of
the
mandatory
special
parole
term.
the
government
didn't
allege
that
he
deliberately
bypassed
his
right
to
appeal.
the
government
didn't
allege
that
there
was
an
intentional
delay,
and
the
government
didn't
allege
that
its
ability
to
re-prosecute
was
in
any
way
impaired
by
the
passage
of
time
involved
here.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no,
rule
--
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
32
(a)
(2),
to
this
day
does
not
require
a
district
judge
to
advice
a
guilty
pleading
defendant
of
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
at
the
same
time
however,
for
the
government
to
argue
that
a
direct
appeal
is
an
adequate
remedy
is
somewhat
undercut
by
the
fact
that
there
was
no
record
--
that
there
was
no
likelihood
that
a
guilty
plea
in
person
is
in
fact
going
to
know
of
that
remedy
in
time
to
make
use
of
it.
and
it's
that--
it's
for
that
reason
that
it's
significant
to
remind
the
court
that
32
(a)
(2)
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
not
necessarily.
i
don't
like
being
in
the
position
of
suggesting
that
certain
inferences
should
or
should
not
be
drawn.
however,
if
the
purpose
of
rule
11
is
what
it
plainly
is
to
avoid
extra
--
to
avoid
colloquy
outside
of
the
record,
i
think
that
those
kind
of
inferences
have
to
avoided
because
they
require
speculation
as
to
facts
outside
the
record.
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
to
indicate
whether
or
not
mr.
timmreck
was
advised
of
his
right
to
appeal
and
whether
or
not
he
was
advised
of
collateral
relief,
whether
or
not
he
was
surprised
at
the
length
of
the
sentence.
the
fact
is
i
think
that
if
we're
going
to
engage
in
inferences,
i
think
there
is
a
very
inference
that
a
person
who
had
no
criminal
record
before
and
who
has
just
been
sentenced
to
a
very
lengthy
prison
term
is
going
to
be
very
much
taken
aback
by
that
and
may
not
be
in
a
position
to
think
clearly
about
whether
or
not
to
request
advice
from
counsel
as
to
remedies
until
the
initial
shock
wears
off.
and
by
that
time,
the
time
for
appeal
may
well
have
passed.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
it's
conceded
by
the
government.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
sixth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i'm
sorry,
justice
white.
the
ninth
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit,
obviously,
the
first
circuit,
and
the
third
circuit,
and
i
believe
the
circuits
not
only
hold
that
but
also
find
collateral
relief
available.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
right,
the
point
i
was
--
the
finish
to
the
answer
was
that
the
circuits
which
do
not
find
collateral
relief
available
also,
i
believe,
unanimously
agreed
that
this
is
a
direct
consequence
of
the
plea
to
--
and
that
failure
to
advice
would
be
a
violation.
they
disagree
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
of
rule
11.
they
disagree
as
to
whether
or
not
collateral
review
would
be
available.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
he
pronounced
sentence
of
10
years
incarceration,
5
years
mandatory
special
parole,
and
a
$5,000
committed
fine.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
at
that
time
those
words
had
been
uttered,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
whether
or
not
he
understood
the
significance
of
it
and
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
the
keyword
to
somewhat
who
is
being
sentenced
his
parole
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
different
kind
of
parole
that
applies
only
in
drug
cases
and
only
since
1970
and
does
not
apply
in
other
circumstances
in
the
federal
system
might
easily
escape
the
person
who's
being
sentenced
in
terms
of
the
significance
and
in
terms
of
the
differences
between
the
mandatory
special
parole
and
traditional
parole.
section
2255
exists
to
ensure
the
capacity
of
our
legal
system
to
provide
substantive
justice
and
to
ensure
a
forum
for
releasing
all
cases
of
illegal
restraint.
it
is
a
flexible
remedy
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
language
in
its
opinion
in
davis
there
is
nothing
in
the
holdings
of
--
in
the
prior
holdings
of
this
court
to
indicate
that
the
availability
of
2255
is
in
any
way
reduced
where
the
allegation
of
illegal
custody
is
one
grounded
in
laws
as
opposed
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that's
an
--
by
way
of
background,
that
undercuts
the
government's
argument
with
respect
to
the
non-constitutional
nature
of
the
argument
here.
additionally,
i
think
that
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
consider
the
role
of
rule
11
in
protecting
the
adversary
system.
that
in
contrast
to
a
trial
situation
and
a
collateral
attack
after
a
trial,
such
as
occurred
in
davis,
where
there
is
adversary
litigation
as
to
numerous
questions
of
law
and
where
there
is
a
full
fact
finding
process,
the
likelihood
of
any
one
error
being
prejudicial
or
being
fundamentally
prejudicial
is
reduced.
in
a
guilty
plea
proceeding
however,
where
the
charges
are
not
disputed
and
where
a
person
is
convicting
himself
or
herself
out
of
his
or
her
own
mouth,
an
indi
--
an
error
that
fails
to
advice
the
defendant
of
an
important
consequence
of
the
guilty
plea
assumes
much
more
fundamental
dimensions.
when
the
additional
fact
that
approximately
85%
of
the
convictions
in
the
federal
system
are
the
result
of
guilty
pleas
is
taken
into
account,
i
think
that
the
significance
to
the
importance
--
to
maintaining
the
principles
underlying
the
adversary
system
is
enhanced.
and
it's
for
that
--
taking
those
matters
into
account,
i
think
that
the
government's
argument
with
regard
to
restricting
the
scope
of
collateral
review
has
to
be
unpersuasive.
i
think
that
the
government's
argument
with
regard
to
direct
appeal
being
a
sufficient
remedy
is
further
undercut
by
the
fact
that
the
rule
32
(a)
(2)
does
not
require
an
accused
to
be
advised
of
the
right
to
appeal
and
in
point
of
fact,
mr.
timmreck
here
was
not
advised
of
his
right
to
appeal.
and
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
mandatory
special
parole
term
is
a
unique
provision
which
operates
very
differently
from
traditional
parole
and
can
result
in
incarceration
for
the
entire
period
of
the
mandatory
special
parole
term
even
if
the
violation
occurs
on
the
last
day.
also,
that
the
risk
of
re-incarceration
is
not
minimal.
the
statistics
would
indicate
that
between
35%
and
45%
of
persons
placed
on
parole
are
subsequently
returned
to
prison
for
violations
and
that
approximately
2/3
of
those
violations
are
technical
and
rather
than
being
for
commission
of
additional
felonies.
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
that
particular
prejudice
ought
to
be
shown
is
similar
to
its
argument
in
mccarthy
that
substantial
compliance
with
rule
11
was
sufficient
for
purposes
of
direct
appeal.
the
rejection
of
that
argument
in
mccarthy,
i
think,
applies
with
equal
force
here
because
as
this
court
noted
in
mccarthy,
a
violation
of
rule
11
inherently
prejudices
the
accused
because
it
deprives
him
or
her
of
the
rule's
procedural
safeguards
that
are
designed
to
facilitate
the
ac
--
an
accurate
determination
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
similarly,
the
government's
argument
that
particular
prejudice
ought
to
be
shown,
i
think
would
create
a
standard
which
is
more
difficult
to
administer
than
the
objective
standard
applied
by
the
sixth
circuit
here.
it
would
involve
the
district
courts
in
hearings
on
the
question
of
particular
prejudice.
it
would
involve
the
courts
in
--
it
would
be
more
time
consuming
in
terms
of
judicial
time.
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
achieve
uniform
results
and
it
would
make
it
difficult
to
any
defendant
regardless
of
whether
the
defendant
would
in
fact
have
continued
with
the
guilty
plea
to
meet
the
burden
of
proof.
i
think
it
would
be
con
--
i
would
hope
that
the
government
would
concede
that
persons
plead
guilty
for
numbers
of
--
any
number
of
reasons,
some
of
which
are
beyond
the
comprehension
of
experienced
counsel
and
judges.
and
that
in
these
--
some
circumstances,
persons
would
not
have
continued
to
offer
their
pleas.
the
standard
that
the
government
proposes
is
one
which
would
make
it
difficult
for
all
persons
including
them
to
sustain
their
burden
of
proof.
an
objective
test
would
promote
judicial
economy
by
results
being
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings
and
it
would
provide
an
additional
incentive
not
only
to
defense
counsel
and
to
government
counsel
on
the
basis
of
their
general
ethical
responsibility,
but
by
an
additional
incentive
because
of
the
standard
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that's
more
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
more
or
le
--
well,
more
or
less.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
prejudice
is
inherent
a
violation
of
rule
11
for
the
reasons
i've
indicated
and
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
in
district
court?
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
there
shouldn't
have
been
--
had
an
objective
standard
been
applied
by
the
district
judge,
there
would've
been
no
need
for
a
hearing.
the
pleadings
--
the
record
of
the
case
below
would
have
entitled
mr.
timmreck
to
relief
in
a
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
depending
on
the
circumstances.
where
this
has
been
a
violation,
that
should
be
sufficient
because
the
violation
is
one
that
is
so
fundamental
to
the
dis
--
to
the
defendants
offering
of
a
knowing
and
voluntary
guilty
plea.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
a
rule
--
if
an
objective
standard
were
adopted,
the
government
would
have
an
incentive
to
ensure
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
further
litigation
because
the
government
would
have
an
additional
incentive,
as
the
sixth
circuit
noted
in
its
opinion
here
to
ensure
that
mistakes
such
as
the
judge
and
both
counsels
failed
to
catch
here
did
not
occur.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes?
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
do
not.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
that
i
--
i
read
stone
v.
powell
carefully
and
i
don't
think
that
the
government
other
than
mentioning
it
in
passing,
is
really
relying
on
it
in
this
case.
i
think
their
primary
reliance
is
on
davis
and
on
hill.
i
think
that
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
the
facts
and
the
issue
involved
in
stone
v.
powell
are
sufficiently
different
dealing
as
they
do
with
questions
of
state
federal
relations,
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
dealing
with
the
question
and
ultimately
turning
on
the
opportunity
for
full
hearing
in
the
state
courts
that
in
my
preparation
of
my
presentation,
it
did
not
strike
me
as
a
case
that
would
involve
itself
in
this
court's
decision
here.
to
the
extent
however,
justice
blackmun,
that
the
question
does
arise,
i
think
that
the
question
of
opportunity
for
hearing
as
being
critical
in
stone
v.
powell
is
in
some
respect
similar
to
the
fact
that
here,
there
was
no
opportunity
--
there
was
no
advice
of
the
right
to
appeal
and
therefore,
there
was
no
assurance
that
the
defendant
knew
of
his
opportunity
to
have
an
immediate
hearing
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
obviously,
that
would
depend
in
part
on
the
grounds
that
the
court
--
you
know,
states
in
support
of
its
decision.
i
think
that
if
the
--
depending
on
grounds
that
this
court
were
to
chose
for
rendering
its
decision
in
this
case,
that
if
an
--
if
a
subjective
standard
were
adopted,
such
as
the
government
is
suggesting,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
a
person
who
was
not
advised
of
their
penal
consequences
who
for
whatever
reasons
did
not
take
an
appeal
and
later
challenged
the
--
their
conviction
but
who
in
fact
would
not
have
offered
a
guilty
plea
maybe
out
the
door
even
though
as
a
gut
matter,
they
should
be
entitled
to
relief.
and
assert
one
--
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
government's
position
is
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
there
are
obviously
cases
that
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
point
is
i
think
the
government's
--
regardless
of
what
the
government
is
saying
here
today,
if
this
court
adopts
the
government's
proposed
test,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
a
person
who
is
not
advised
of
a
mandatory
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
also
would
urge
on
this
court
that
failure
to
advice
a
guilty
pleading
person
that
a
direct
consequence
of
his
or
her
plea
is
a
mandatory
special
parole
year
--
special
parole
term
of
three
years
to
life
also
is
a
fundamental
defect.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes?
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
i
understand
the
court's
question,
i
believe
that
judge
feikens'
language
is
somewhat
inappropriate
for
the
reason
that
anybody
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--
whether
it's
a
judge
or
anybody
else,
is
only
speculating
what
the
defendant
has
done.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
understand
that
that
was
his
language.
i
--
what
i'm
suggesting
and
i
think
that,
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
page
case,
judge
borman
from
the
fourth
circuit
says
that
--
he
says,
as
it
point
out,
i
want
to
make
known,
that
is
that
it's
pure
speculation
what
the
defendant
would've
done.
and
for
the
judge
to
conclude
that
mr.
timmreck
would
have
continued
to
offer
his
plea
is
in
fact
a
matter
of
opinion.
it
can't
be
construed
as
a
finding
of
fact.
and
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
don't
believe
that
the
nature
of
that
statement
by
the
judge
is
a
finding
of
fact
so
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
would
come
into
play.
thank
you
very
much.
