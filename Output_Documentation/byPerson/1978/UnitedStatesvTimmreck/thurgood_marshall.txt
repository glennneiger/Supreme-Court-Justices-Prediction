justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
the
judge
know
about
what's
going
on
in
somebody
else's
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
geller,
couldn't
we
maintain
your
position
by
merely
saying
the
two
findings
that
the
district
court
were
enough
and
not
get
into
the
general
rule
of
how
far
2255
goes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
alright
but
as
i
understand
this
party
himself
in
the
district
court
said
in
so
many
words
that
he
hadn't
been
prejudiced.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't.
well,
isn't
that
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you
have
several
days
talking
to
your
client?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
--
you
mean
he
forgot
it
for
a
whole
lot
of
days?
how
long
were
you
talking
to
him
before
he
pleaded
guilty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
before
he
walked
into
the
corridor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
before
you
walked
in
the
courtroom,
you
entirely
advised
yourself
as
to
the
law
involved,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
well,
don't
you
usually
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
find
out
what
the
law
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
this
time
you
didn't?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
you
did
have
a
recollection,
your
client
would
be
out
of
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
if
you
happen
to
recollect
that
you
did
tell
him,
your
client
would
be
out
of
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
rule
11
doesn't
put
any
requirement
on
the
defense
counsel
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
just
filed
a
piece
of
paper
and
say,
"judge
jones
didn't
advice
me
of
the
special
parole,"
and
automatically
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
automatically,
you
get
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
need
a
little
more
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
had
a
hearing
here,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
saying
that
they're
asking
for
more
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
even
ask
for
that
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
irony
of
a
2255
is
you
file
of
piece
of
paper
and
that's
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
you
think
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
a
hearing?
