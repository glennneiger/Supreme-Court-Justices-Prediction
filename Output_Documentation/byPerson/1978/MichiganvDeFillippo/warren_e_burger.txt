chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
michigan
against
defillippo.
mr.
baughman
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
arresting
officer
had
some
other
grounds
on
which
to
arrest
this
man,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
may
have
one,
he
represented
that
he
was
a
police
officer
is
it
not
a
crime
of
some
kind
in
detroit
and
in
michigan
for
a
person
to
impersonate
a
police
officer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
baughman
this
case
is
not
one
prosecution
for
violation
of
ordinance
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
of
any
instances
in
your
city
where
one
has
been
prosecuted
for
violating
the
ordinance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
a
prosecuting
attorney
are
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
ever
prosecuted
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
ever
be
determined
if
no
prosecutions
were
ever
brought
under
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
except
the
prosecution
as
--
and
determine
what
they
want
to
prosecute
for.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
you're
standing
on
the
presumptive
validity
of
the
ordinance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
were
not
so
i
suppose
the
officer
would
be
subject
to
leisure
to
suit
for
unlawful
arrest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
terry
authorizes
the
stop.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
basis
of
facts
observed
by
the
officer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you're
saying
that
what
the
officer
observed
gave
him
all
the
right
to
make
a
terry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
that
may
furnish
probable
cause
for
his
arrest,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
incriminate
him,
that's
your
position.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
howarth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
doing
that
they
were
rejecting
the
terry
type
of
situation
were
they
were
not
--
they
were
saying
this
was
not
a
terry
stop.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
time
of
the
day
or
night
was
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
any
of
these
accurate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
can't
offer
a
proof
before
this
court
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
telling
us
we
should
not
accept
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
read
to
you
out
of
the
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
either
accept
it
or
we
don't,
and
if
we
accept
it
we
can't
accept
any
of
your
hypotheses.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
would
you
say
that
at
that
time
and
in
those
circumstances
in
an
alley,
after
10:00
o'clock
at
night,
presumably
after
dark
that
the
police
officer's
suspicions
were
being
aroused
by
at
least
the
ambiguity
that
you
are
suggesting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
don't
need
a
document
to
identify
yourself
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
other
people
we
nearby
in
this
dark
alley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
that
means
up
here
that
there
were
only
two
people
on
this
record
and
the
court
has
so
indicated
that
michigan
courts
have
taken
that
for
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
only
treating
one
situation
here
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course,
if
we
only
put
it
this
way
the
question
in
detroit
or
michigan
can
people
be
detained
as
material
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
police
officers
don't
get
the
witnesses
then
and
there
very
often
the
odds
are
they
won't
get
them
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
point
to
anything
in
any
of
the
opinions
of
the
michigan
courts
that
indicate
they
thought
what
you
are
presenting
to
us
now
in
this
brandeis
concept
was
relevant
to
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
we
should
spend
any
time
considering
it
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
let's
take
one
that's
very
specific,
speed
limit
of
55
miles
adopted
by
a
state
not
a
federal
and
a
the
car
is
arrested
going
75
miles
an
hour,
is
the
question
of
good
faith
there
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
officer
is
under
a
mandate
to
arrest
people
going
over
55
miles
an
hour
isn't
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
suppose
that
a
search
of
the
car
disclosed
that
the
car
was
loaded
with
heroin.
later
if
that's
determined
by
this
car,
the
55
mile
an
hour
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
an
under
burden
on
interstate
commerce
let
us
assume
does
that
mean
they
suppress
the
heroin
in
that
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
