the
court

detroit,
the
court
of
general
criminal
jurisdiction.

certainly
martinez-fuerte
which
was
i
think
the
last
round
of
the
alley
search
cases,
says
that
you
can
detain
under
particular
circumstances
without
regard
to
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
is
dangerous
if
you
suspect
an
offense.
justice
william

mr.
howarth
on
page
12
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
first
page
of
the
opinion
of
michigan
court
of
appeals
which
is
the
court
that
laid
down
the
rule
that
we
are
reviving
here,
i
take
it.
the
court
says,
when
asked
for
his,
defendant
did
not
appear
intoxicated
but
when
he
was
asked
for
his
identification
he
replied
that
he
was
sergeant
mash,
a
detroit
police
officer,
when
asked
for
his
badge
number
defendant
replied
that
he
was
working
for
sergeant
mash.
now
that's
the
hypothesis
we
have
to
work
from
here,
isn't
it,
even
though
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
found
it
differently,
had
the
case
been
argued
different.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
we
independently
make
some
factual
determination
that's
never
been
made
in
the
state
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
predicate
for
all
of
this
is
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
behavior
of
an
individual
wants
further
investigation
and
if
you
define
that
as
a
grounds
for
a
terry
type
stop,
you
have
certainly
eliminated
a
lot
of
people
from
the
purview
of
the
ordinance,
haven't
you?
