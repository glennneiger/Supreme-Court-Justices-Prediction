that
is
true
that
the
ordinance
makes
criminal
only
a
refusal
not
an
inability.
justice

and
there
is
a
difference.
justice

a
person
in
a
bathing
suit,
you
can
and
ask
him
his
name,
he
just
gives
you
his
name
you
ask
him
for
his
driver's
license,
he
says
i
am
sorry
i
don't
have
my
driver
license
in
my
bathing
suit,
that's
not
a
refusal.
justice
potter
stewart
but
an
inability
is
not
criminal
under
the
ordinance.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
there
is
a
difference
let's,
you
are
saying
that
you
may,
your
case
has
good
many
familiar
names,
because
i
have
wrote
some
of
those
and
wouldn't
there
be
a
difference
--
let's
say
a
state
legislature
should
say
no
warrant
will
ever
be
required
in
this
state
for
the
arrest
or
search
of
anybody.
well
that
would
clearly
be
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment,
it
will
be
an
invalid
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
but
here,
and
therefore
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
would
still
regardless
of
that
statute
would
still
be
unconstitutional
unless
it
were
with
one,
under
one
of
the
exceptions
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but
here
the
question
is
if
you
have
a
criminal
ordinance
on
the
books
that
has
never
been
held
by
anybody
to
be
an
invalid
ordinance,
and
a
policeman
arrest
somebody
for
violation
of
that
ordinance
is
that
a
wrongful
arrest,
that's
quite
a
different
question
isn't
it?
