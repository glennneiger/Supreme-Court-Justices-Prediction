justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
baughman
you
stated
the
one
that
petitioner
who
responded
rather
refused
to
identify
himself
he
was
arrested.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
ordinance
doesn't
provide
for
an
arrest
in
that
situation
or
is
that
considered
to
be
an
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
under
the
general
code
rather
than
the
sentence
that
says,
if
the
person
is
unable
to
provide
reasonable
evidence
of
his
true
identity
the
police
officer
may
transport
him
to
the
nearest
precinct
in
order
to
ascertain
his
identity,
that's
not
what
you
are
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
revision
of
the
ordinance
is
not
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
due
process
defect
or
any
defect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
stone
against
powell,
the
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
had
held
that
search
to
be
invalid
was
that
it
held
a
ordinance
of,
that
was
at
henderson
in
nevada,
the
vagrancy
ordinance
was
an
invalid
ordinance
it
held
it
after
the
fact,
after
the
search.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
court
either
approved
or
disapprove
that
reasoning
in
stone,
did
this
court
in
stone
against
powell
either
approve
or
disapprove.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
court
rather
assumed
that
it
was
an
illegal
search
because
the
vagrancy
ordinance
was
an
invalid
ordinance
although
the
placement
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
had
no
reason
to
believe
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
that
throws
any
light
on
your
question
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
that
was
the
fact
wasn't
in
stone
against
powell.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reason
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
was
an
invalid
arrest
was
that
the
ninth
circuit
after
the
fact
decided
it
was
invalid
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
your
primary
understanding
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
understanding
that
this
was
in
ordinance
duly
enacted
by
the
city
of
detroit
that
there
was
a
reasonable
cause
believe
that
the
respondent
was
violating
that
ordinance
and
that
therefore
the
policemen
arrested
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
your
submission
is
a
valid
arrest
without
reference
to
whether
or
not
some
court,
this
court
or
some
other
court
might
subsequently
find
that
ordinance
to
have
been
invalid.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
purposes
to
stop
under
terry
must
be
to
search
the
stop
being
for
weapons
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
terry's
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
based
on
suspicion
that
he
is
armed
in
dangerous
and
the
stop
is
for
the
purpose
of
searching
him
for
weapons
and
if
necessary
disarming
him,
is
that
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say,
what
would
the
investigator
stop.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
justification
for
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
you
said
two
possibilities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
forcible
or
consensual.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
the
women.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
the
protection
against
the
compulsory
self-incrimination
is
not
involved,
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it
may
not
be,
i
mean
what
if
name
is
john
dillinger?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
likely
not
because
john
dillinger
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
aren't
there
cases
arising
under
the
constitutional
guarantee
against
compulsory
self
incrimination
which
protect
a
witness
from
even
giving
his
name.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
witness
stand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
you
conceive
of
such
a
situation
existing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
his
name
is
john
dillinger
or
al
capone
transferring
his
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
there
but
you
say
statute
or
ordinance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
making
it
a
criminal
office
for
a
person
to
refuse
an
inquiry
by
a
police
officer,
knowing
him
to
be
police
officer,
what
is
your
name
would
that
would
be
a
invalid
statute
or
ordinance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan
in
this
case
had,
what
was
wrong
with
this
ordinance
was
that
it
seeks
to
make
criminal
conduct
which
is,
make
criminal
conduct
which
is
innocent,
but
that's
true
with
every
criminal
statute,
it's
innocent
to
drive
over
55
miles
an
hour
on
a
highway
and
the
correct
statute
tells
you
its
criminal
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
really,
i
think
that's
--
arrest
of
that
doubtful
validity
of
a
statute
such
as
we
have
hypothecated,
that
it
makes
criminal
conduct
which
is,
was
before
this
ordinance
was
passed
was
innocent
conduct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
that,
i
mean
isn't
that
true
with
every
criminal
statute
-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
one
believes
in
natural
law
of
some
kind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
you
have
a
lawful
arrest,
the
violation
of
a
valid
criminal
statute
at
the
time
of
arrest,
you
can
search
that
person
lawfully.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
established
fourth
amendment
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
vagueness
and
over
breath
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment
--
with
due
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
to
do
with
due
process.
