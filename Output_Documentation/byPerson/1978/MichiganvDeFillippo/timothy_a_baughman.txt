mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
discuss
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
detroit
stop
and
identify
ordinance
i
would
first
like
to
discuss
whether
the
constitutionality
of
that
ordinance
is
necessarily
relevant
to
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
phencyclidine
seized
from
respondent
is
admissible
against
him
in
a
trial
for
possession
of
phencyclidine
and
the
facts
are
these.
on
september
14th,
1976
at
approximately
10:00
pm
two
detroit
police
officers
answered
a
radio
run
to
investigate
a
complaint
regarding
two
persons
drunk
in
an
alley
by
a
garage.
as
they
pulled
their
scout
car
into
the
alley
and
questioned
they
observed
respondent
and
a
woman
who
was
in
the
process
of
talking
her
pants
down.
they
drove
on
into
the
alley
and
while
seated
in
the
scout
car
directed
questions
to
these
persons.
the
woman
stated
that
she
had
to
go
to
the
bathroom.
respondent
was
asked
for
identification
and
stated
that
he
was
sergeant
mash.
he
was
asked
for
his
badge
number
and
he
gave
a
number.
he
was
again
asked
for
identification
and
this
time
he
stated
that
he
worked
for
sergeant
mash.
at
this
point
the
female
approached
the
scout
car
and
she
was
asked
for
identification.
her
response
was
to
dump
the
contents
of
her
wallet
through
the
open
police
car
window
on
to
the
lap
of
the
officer
who
was
seated
inside.
she
was
then
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct
because
of
her
intoxicated
condition.
the
respondent
was
arrested
for
a
violation
of
the
detroit
ordinance
for
refusing
to
identify
himself.
he
was
searched
and
on
his
possession
a
quantity
of
marijuana
was
found.
also
taken
from
him
was
a
package
of
cigarettes
and
in
that
package
the
officer
observed
a
tin
foil
packet.
that
packet
was
ultimately
determined
to
contain
a
quantity
of
phencyclidine
and
it
was
for
possession
of
phencyclidine
that
respondent
was
ultimately
charged.
he
was
bound
over
for
trial
in
detroit
recorder's
court
and
a
motion
to
quash
the
information
was
brought
before
the
12
judge
and
denied.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
granted
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
ordered
that
the
information
bequest
and
the
case
dismissed.
the
michigan
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
handles
all
criminal
matters
in
the
city
of
detroit
both
felony
and
misdemeanor.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
considered
to
be
an
arrest.
the
ordinance
declares
that
it
as
unlawful
to
refuse
to
identify
oneself
and
an
unlawful
act
under
a
general
penalty
provision
of
the
detroit
city
code
calls
for
a
90
day
penalty
and
a
$500
fine.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct,
i
believe
that
is
separate
provision
from
the
refusal
to
identify
portion,
i
think
that's
made
more
clear
in
the
ultimate
revision
of
the
ordinance
by
the
detroit
city
counsel.
that's
a
separate
provision.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no
i
think
the
revision
only
makes
clear
what
was
intended
all
along,
i
see
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
he
may
have,
that
has
not
been
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
is
and
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
he
may
well
have
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
false
personation
of
a
police
officer
at
that
time.
you
cannot
be
convicted
of
false
personation
of
an
police
officer
in
michigan
unless
you
act
as
such,
but
that
does
not
of
course
mean
there
was
not
probably
cause
to
arrest
the
fact
he
could
not
have
been
convicted,
so
that
may
well
be
true.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well
it
is
our
position
that
by
giving
a
false
and
admittedly
false
answer
when
he
later
changed
the
answer
that
that
is
tantamount
to
refusal
to
identify.
in
this
record
it
appears
that
he
never
did
state
that
he
was
gary
defillippo.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well
i
think
if
he
gave
a
name
then
we
would
go
on
to
the
next
portion
of
verifiable
proof
written
or
oral
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
that
point
was
not
reached
in
this
case,
because
we,
they
never
got
the
identification
portion.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no
it
not,
this
is
a
derivate
evidence
case.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
am
not
personally
aware
of
those,
those
would
be
tried
by
the
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes
i
am.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no
i
have
not,
they
are
not
prosecuted
by
the
wayne
county
prosecutor's
office,
they
are
prosecuted
by
the
city
of
detroit
corporation
counsel
as
they
are
ordinance
violations
and
not
state
law
violations.
i
am
not
familiar
with
whether
if
they
are
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
the
only
other
method
would
be
a
possibility
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
in
michigan
law
which
would
be
allowed.
but
i
believe
that
if
the
issue
of
no
prosecution
has
ever
been
brought
in
this
ordinance
would
have
to
be
raised
in
the
trial
court
by
a
defendant
claiming
that
this
was
his
only
method
of
attacking
it
and
that
was
not
done
in
this
case
and
i
don't
think
this
record
demonstrates
whether
or
not
there
has
been
prosecution.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct,
i
am
just
saying
that
i,
on
this
record
and
personally
i
do
not
know
if
persons
have
been
prosecuted
and
they
well
have
been
but
that
within
the
knowledge
of
the
detroit
corporation
counsel
and
i
do
not
know.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
phencyclidine
seized
from
respondent
is
admissible
against
him
and
that
his
arrest
was
valid
regardless
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance.
this
court
has
stated
that
the
question
of
the
good
faith
of
the
police
officers
only
arises
after
a
constitutional
violation
has
been
found,
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
suppression
remedy
should
be
applied
but
whether
or
not
a
constitutional
violation
occurred
at
all,
it
turns
on
a
objective
assessment
of
the
officer's
actions
in
light
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
confronting
him
at
the
time
he
acted.
it's
our
position
that
when
an
officer
enforces
a
presumptively
valid
penal
ordinance,
the
violence
of
which
has
occurred
in
his
presence
as
is
his
duty,
and
objective
assessments
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
known
to
him
at
that
time
cannot
include
that
which
was
not
known
to
him
at
that
time
that
in
the
appellate
court
would
subsequently
hold
the
penal
ordinance
to
be
unconstitutional.
when
that
legislature
enacts
the
penal
ordinance
or
statute
and
ultimately
there
is
determined
to
be
a
due
process
defect
in
that
ordinance.
this
means
that
a
person
cannot
be
incarcerated
pursuant
to
a
conviction
for
violation
of
that
ordinance
without
his
fourteenth
amendment
rights
being
violated.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
any
defect
that's
correct,
but
it
does
not
mean
that
when
he
is
arrested
for
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
violated
that
ordinance
by
a
police
officer
when
the
ordinances
of
that
time
presume
valid
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated.
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
precisely
in
this
manner
and
these
are
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
in
those
cases
that
court
has
refused
to
reach
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
underlying
ordinance
in
derivative
evidence
cases,
holding
that
that
question
is
not
relevant
to
the
fourth
amendment
question
and
holding
that
when
a
person
is
arrested
on
probable
cause.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well
our
charge
is
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
they
said
the
arrest
was
valid
and
saying
that
the
arrest
was
valid
i
would
take
to
me
that
they
were
saying
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation.
they
also
went
to
say
that
the
application
of
exclusionary
rule
in
that
context
would
not
serve
any
purpose.
and
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
even
if
there
had
been
a
fourth
amendment
violation
and
we
take
both
of
those
positions.
we
believe
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation
in
this
case
but
if
there
was
a
fourth
amendment,
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied.
in
almeida-sanchez,
this
court
did
hold
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation
occurred
in
a
case
where
officers
did
act
in
reliance
on
a
statute
which
had
not
been
declared
unconstitutional.
but
we
believe
that
the
difference
there
is
that
that
statute
was
not
a
penal
statute,
its
sole
purpose
was
to
authorize
searches
in
certain
circumstances,
to
authorize
what
might
determine
fourth
amendment
activity.
now
this
ordinance
does
have
a
portion
that
authorizes
fourth
amendment
activity,
the
stop
of
the
person.
but
we
believe
that
that
portion
of
the
ordinance
is
not
at
issue
here
either
factually
or
legally.
it's
a
codification
of
terry
versus
ohio
and
we
believe
that
the
facts
in
the
instant
case
plainly
show
grounds
for
a
stop
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
lower
court
has
held
to
the
contrary.
the
question
is
the
penal
portion
of
the
ordinance,
the
substantive
offense
portion
of
the
ordinance
i
think
is
what
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
correct,
but
the
ordinance
provides
that
when
one
is
stopped
pursuant
to
terry
versus
ohio,
he
must
upon
request
state
his
identity.
it
is
making
the
conduct
of
refusing
to
state
identity
a
crime
that
this
court
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
do
not
believe
so,
no.
i
think
it
was
before
the
court
is
whether
the
legislature
ultimately
as
far
as
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
goes,
its
whether
or
not
the
legislature
can
make
this
conduct
of
crime
but
what
they
did
here
is
create
a
substantive
offence
and
we
agree
that
the
legislature
cannot
make
valid,
make
valid
conduct
which
is
unconstitutional
under
the
fourth
amendment
when
they
act
procedurally
as
in
almeida-sanchez
but
where
they
create
a
substantive
offense,
where
the
legislature
acts
pursuant
to
its
exclusive
function
of
defining
crime
and
ordaining
punishment
whether
or
not
it
has
drawn
the
statute
constitutionally,
whether
or
not
it
can
prohibit
the
conduct,
it
feats
to
prohibit
as
a
fourteenth
amendment
question.
whether
or
not
the
person
was
arrested
pursuant
to
probable
cause
for
violation
of
that
ordinance
is
the
fourth
amendment
question
and
we
submit
that
plainly
here
there
was
more
than
probable
cause
to
believe
that
mr.
defillippo
had
violated
the
ordinance.
there
being
probable
cause
his
arrest
did
not
violate
his
fourth
amendment
rights
in
the
search
of
person
incident
to
that
arrest
was
proper.
now,
if
this
court
is
to
hold
that
the
seizure
of
respondent's
person
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
inquiry
is
not
over
for
then
consideration
of
(inaudible)
is
appropriate
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied.
now
justices
paul
and
rehnquist
stated
in
concurring
in
brown
versus
illinois
that
there
was
no
legitimate
justification
for
depriving
the
prosecution,
a
reliable
and
prohibitive
evidence
in
cases
of
technical
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
they
gave
us
an
example
when
a
person
is
arrested
pursuant
to
a
statute
which
is
not
yet
been
declared
unconstitutional.
but
we
stated
our
position
that
we
believe
that
this
conduct
is
not
even
a
technical
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
if
this
court
so
views
it,
then
we
fully
agreed
that
the
application
of
exclusionary
rule
in
this
situation
would
serve
no
valid
purpose.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
don't
i
think
the
majority
did
not
reach
that
question
deciding
the
case
on
the
habeas
corpus
issue
instead
the
working
current
opinions
which
disagreed
with
the
application
of
exclusionary
role
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i'm
not
certain
if
that
may
well
have
been
in
underlined
assumption
of
the
court,
i
believe
that
it
just
stood
for
the
proposition
that
those
kind
of
claims
could
not
be
brought
for
habeas
corpus
valid
or
not
i
don't
think
it
really
settles
whether
or
not
the
claim
was
valid.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that
was
the
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
certainly
and
that
demonstrates
that
there
was,
there
is
split
among
the
circuits
because
the
fifth
circuit
is
held
to
the
contrary.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that
was
in
brown
versus
illinois.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes
he
was.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
occurred
after
the
arrest.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
believe
it
is,
it
is
not
necessary
ultimately
for
this
court
to
decide
that
issue
to
decide
that
phencyclidine
is
admissible
against
respondent
in
this
case
because
this
court
could
hold
that
that
even
if
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional,
phencyclidine
is
admissible
because
either
the
arrest
was
valid
or
because
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
apply
to
this
conduct
in
any
event
and
therefore
not
reach
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance,
it
then
being
relevant
but
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
believe
it
would
the
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
my
primary
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation
occurred.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct,
that
is
our
first
position.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
we're
standing
on
the
proposition
that
that
even
if
a
person
cannot
be
convicted
badly
for
violating
a
penal
statute
when
he
is
arrested
before
that
finding
of
unconstitutionally
occurs
upon
probable
cause
to
believe
he
violated
it
that
no
constitutional
violation
has
been
committed
by
the
officer.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
he
may
have
a
good
faith
defense
on
the
civil
suit
but
then
the
suit
maybe
brought
against
him,
that's
possible.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
don't
believe
there's
a
fifth
amendment
problem
here
and
we
rely
heavily
on
the
cases
from
the
california
courts
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well
there,
in
asking
someone
to
identify
themself
under
these
circumstances,
a
person
is
not
being
compelled
to
give
incriminating
information
i
think
california
versus
byers
is
somewhat
on
point
although
i
think
the
facts
are
stronger
in
this
case,
in
california
versus
byers
that
only
did
a
person
identify
himself
but
by
so
doing
they
indicated
that
there
were
a
person
involved
in
an
accident
and
this
court
indicated
there
that
identification
is
essentially
a
neutral
act.
this
person
has
just
been
asked
to
identify
himself
and
not
indicate
that
he's
in
a
accident
or
any
other
provision.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes,
but
it
was
a
criminal
violation
to
fail
the
stop
at
the
scene
and
leave
your
name
and
address
that
was
a
penal
statute.
in
this
case,
the
person
is
just
asked
to
give
their
name,
name
is
not
incriminating
this,
the
government
can
obtain
a
person's
name
in
any
other
context.
they
can
get
it
through
--
send
out
jury
questionnaires
to
perspective
jurors,
tax
forms,
census
forms.
it's
a
multitude
of
ways
in
which
the
government
can
compel
a
person
to
give
up
their
name,
a
testimony
in
a
courtroom
person
maybe
called
and
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
cases.
it
is
our
position
that
there's
not
a
fifth
amendment
problem
because
no
testimonial
information
is
compelled
from
a
person
in
this
situation.
now,
it
may
be
possible
to
conceive
of
circumstances
where
other
statutes
require
an
identification
in
different
context
may
raise
self-incrimination
problems.although
i'm
hard
put
to
think
of
any
but
i
don't
think
that
this
statute
raises
such
problems.
i
think
the
california
case
is
correct
in
this
point.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
believe
there
was
responsible
cause
to
believe
criminal
activity.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
there
are
several
possibilities
but
i
think
the
officer
had
at
least
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
either
consensual
or
forcible
criminal
sexual
conduct
may
have
been
afoot.
i
think
once
he
observed
the
respondent
in
the
alley.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
there's
not.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
my
supposition
from
the,
the
women
being
in
the
alley
taking
her
pants
down
and
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
that
of
course
that
occurred
after
the
incident,
they
had
stopped.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
think
the
stop
had
already
occurred
at
that
point
and
under
the
ordinance
then
the
officers
were
entitled
to
ask
for
identification.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct
and
that
the
ordinance
then
gave
him
the
right
to
arrest
for
the
violation
of
the
law
that
the
respondent
committed
by
not
identifying
himself.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that
assumes
also
that
there's
a
reasonable,
further
reasonable
suspicion
that
he's
armed
and
dangerous.
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it's
also
for
investigation
i
believe,
the
stop
itself.
if
risk
is
for
protection,
the
stop
is
for
investigation.
this
court
has
said
several
times
in
terry
and
adams
versus
williams
that
the
stop
in
order
to
determine
identity
maybe
the
wisest
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes,
i
think
the
detention
portion
of
terry
i
believe
is
for
investigation,
the
frisk
only
occurs
and
can
only
occur
if
there
is
a
further
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous,
and
then
you
can
frisk
but
the
stop
is
an
investigatory
stop
i
believe.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
in
this
case
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
in
the
general
context.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
in
this
case,
the
officers
when
they
had
the
complaint
of
two
drunks
in
an
alley
and
pulled
into
the
alley
and
saw
respondent
and
the
woman
taking
her
pants
down
and
i
think
that
two
possibilities
were
consensual
or
forcible
criminal
sexual
conduct.
i
think
they
at
least
had
a
duty
to
proceed
into
the
alley
and
investigate
what
was
occurring.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
two.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
forcible
or
consensual,
there
are
varieties
of
statutes
on
either
point.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
is
no
longer
a
criminal
office,
it
was
at
that
time,
there
is
no
new
set
of
statutes
that
deal
with
that
situation.
i
would
point
out
that
openly
it
did
not
appear
that
respondent
was
drunk,
just
the
women.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
just
the
women
appeared
to
be
drunk
after
the
investigation
occurred.
i
would
like
to
return
just
for
moment
to
the
application
of
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case
and
turn
to
the
question
of
what
would
not
apply
in
the
exclusionary
rule
to
these
facts,
i
mean
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
arrest
under
the
ordinance
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
submit
that
it
would
not
result
in
lawless
police
conduct,
but
in
police
continuing
to
do
their
duty
to
enforce
the
violation
of
ordinance
when
they
occur.
if
anything
it
would
deter
a
police
officers
to
not
act
as
courts
reviewing
legislation
before
they
decide
whether
or
not
to
enforce
it.
now
if
the
rule
were
to
be
applied
to
these
facts,
what
would
it
mean.
i
believe
that
hopefully
its
application
should
not
and
would
not
alter
future
police
behavior.
for
the
police
did
that
which
we
would
expect
him
to
do
and
which
we
want
them
to
do
in
the
future.
as
mr.
justice
white
stated
in
his
dissent
in
stone
versus
powell,
that
excluding
the
evidence
in
these
sorts
of
circumstances
can
no
way
affect
future
police
conduct
unless
it
is
to
make
the
officer
less
willing
to
do
his
duty.
now
this
court
and
i
think
wisely
so
and
legislatures
also
wanted
to
maximize
control
of
the
police
officers,
to
reduce
as
low
as
possible
their
area
of
discretion
without
keeping
them
from
operating
at
all.
we
want
suicidal
control
of
their
actions,
but
the
exclusionary
rule
was
applied
in
the
case,
exactly
the
opposite
affect
would
occur
than
the
exclusionary
rule
seeks
to
achieve
for
the
officers
would
then
have
unbridled
discretion
to
decide
what
laws
they
are
going
to
enforce
before
they
enforce
them
and
i
don't
think
that
is
a
result
once
the
exclusionary
rule
is
attended
to
accomplish.
if
then
there
is
no
affect
on
future
police
behavior,
if
there
is
no
removal
of
any
inducement
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
submit
plainly
there
would
be
no
removal
of
any
inducement
in
this
case,
in
suppressing
the
truth
in
the
criminal
proceeding
will
occur
and
nothing
will
have
been
gained.
i
would
also
like
to
briefly
point
to
the
argument
from
judicial
integrity
on
which
i
believe
respondent
heavily
relies.
this
court
has
already
held
that
judicial
integrity
is
not
offended
if
law
enforcement
officials
reasonably
believe
in
good
faith
that
their
conduct
is
in
accordance
with
the
law,
the
time
they
act
even
if
subsequent
decisions
hold
that
their
conduct
was
not
permitted
under
the
constitution
and
here
the
police
acted
as
we
would
want
them
to
act
when
a
violation
of
the
law
occurs
in
their
presence.
since
the
trial
and
is
a
search
for
truth,
to
exclude
the
truth
in
the
absence
of
an
insolent
use
of
police
authority,
in
the
absence
of
achievement
of
any
affect
on
future
police
behavior,
i
submit
as
itself
in
front
to
judicial
integrity.
and
we
have
for
the
purposes
of
argument
here,
assume
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
but
as
i've
indicated
on
the
merits
we
do
not
concede
that
that
ordnance
is
unconstitutional
and
i
would
point
out
that
i
believe
looking
at
the
revision
only
for
clarification
purposes
that
it
does,
the
ordinance
has
three
parts.
there
is
the
stop
portion
which
i
have
discussed.
there
is
a
substantive
offence
portion
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
refuse
to
identify
oneself
and
also
makes
it
a
crime
to
refuse
to
provide
verifiable
proof
written
or
oral
of
that
identification.
the
inability
portion
of
the
statute,
which
justice
stevens
referred
to
i
believe
is
separate
from
the
criminal
portion.
for
person
rather
than
refusing
to
identify
himself
is
unable
somehow
to
provide
verifiable
proof,
he
maybe
detained
into
as
identification
is
verified
and
then
he
is
to
be
released.
this
portion
of
the
ordinance
is
very
similar
to
the
uniform
arrest
act,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
which
allows
two
hour
detention
to
similar
circumstances
and
i
believe
that
portion
is
not
a
issue
in
this
case,
this
is
not
an
inability
to
indentify
this
is
a
refusal
to
indentify
case.
now
the
key
question
it
seems
to
me
is
whether
or
not
the
government
can
make
this
conduct
criminal,
refusal
to
identify.
i
have
already
stated
that
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
problem,
i
think
the
key
question
is
whether
or
not
any
right
of
the
respondent
is
violated
by
the
government
making
this
conduct
criminal
and
the
only
one
that
i
can,
that
comes
to
mind
is
possibly
a
claim
of
an
interference
with
the
right
to
privacy.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
a
governmental
interest
served
in
allowing
and
making
this
conduct
criminal
and
i
think
this
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
question--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
i
would
not
and
i
would
point
out
this
is
a
carefully
circumscribed
ordinance
which
limits
that
authority
to
when
there
has
been
a
voluntary
stop.
only
in
that
circumstance
can
a
officer
demand
identification
and
only
in
that
circumstances,
it
is
a
crime
to
refuse,
not
any
one
on
the
street
can
be
stopped.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
because
the
giving
of
one's
name
is
a
neutral
act
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
the
fact
he
was
john
dillinger--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
that
mean
it
was
apprehension,
but
the
fact
that
he
is
indentified
as
a
person
who
he
is,
is
no
more
incriminating
in
taking
his
finger
prints,
his
blood
his
hair,
other
his
handwriting
example
or
other
activities
this
court
has
held
are
not
testimonial.
a
link
in
a
chain
to
conviction
as
this
court
held
in
byres
leading
to
his
apprehension
does
not
mean
that
the
information
he
imparts
as
testimonial
can
be
used
against
him.
i
don't
believe
he
is
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
although
he
is
compelled
to
give
information.
persons
are
compelled
to
give
information
by
the
government
all
the
time.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
if
it
is
conceivable
under
the
circumstances
that
his
name
alone
would
be
incriminate
him
that
by
which
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
not
under
these
not
under--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that
he
is,
may
subject
into
prosecution
but
not
his
name
itself
is
not
incriminating
piece
of
evidence.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
my
position,
i
believe
that's
what
the
california
courts
have
held
and
i
think
california
v.
byers
would
support
that
proposition.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
i
think
any
officer
can
ask
that
to
any
citizen
but
he
can't
arrest
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
don
not
believe
that
legislature
can
make
it
a
crime
to
refuse
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
upon
no
other
facts.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i
think
that
it's
just
a
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
question
is
whether
a
governmental
interest
to
serve
and
whether
the
means
employed
are
recently
related
to
the
end.
if
the
end
as
i
see
in
this
case
is
the
same
end
that
terry
talks
about
effective
crime
prevention
and
detection.
i
don't
believe
that
the
means
employed
in
that
case
would
be
recently
related
to
achieve
in
that
end
and
also
i
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
cases
state
that
the
means
cannot
be
unduly
impressive
on
individuals,
and
i
believe
that
probably
it
would
be
unduly
impressive,
if
you
do
not
limit
it
at
least
to
the
terry
situation.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
believe
the
constitution
of
the
ordinance
says
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that
would
be
a
fourth
amendment
question
but
i
don't
believe
that's
what's
before
us
here.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that
he
could
i
think
any
citizen
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
then
it
will
be
a
problem
even
if
there
was
a
statute
i
think
certainly
without
a
statute
it
could
be
a
problem.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
assuming
without
any
terry
basis
just
anybody
on
the
street,
it
mean,
i
am
not
saying
it
would
for
certain,
i
think
there
would
be
a
much
more
problems
with
that
ordinance
than
this
one.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
because
i
do
not,
because
the
end
the
effective
crime
prevention
and
detection
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
reasonably
related
to
the
means
stopping
anyone
on
the
street
to
ask
them
their
name
as
it
is
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
might
be
unduly
impressive
on
individuals,
which
is
also
a
due
process
test.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
there
maybe,
there
maybe
there
is
a
different
governmental
interest
served
there
when
you
have
a
request
for
certain
document
as
the
--
it's
not
effective
crime
prevention
and
detection
that's
been
served
in
that
case
it's
the
enforcement
of
the
draft
laws
and
that
might
be
a
different
circumstance.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
any
law
making
conduct
which
is
not
an
element
say
criminal
makes
criminal
conduct
which
is
innocent.
so
i
don't
see
the
point
of
the
michigan
decision
in
that
regard.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
is
true
of
every
criminal
statute.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
thank
you.
