mr.
james
c.
howarth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
which
was
also
the
position
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
a
position
not
reached
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
is
that
the
particular
case
before
the
bar
involves
the
one-on-one
search
of
an
individual
american
citizen
by
the
name
of
gary
defillippo
who
in
september
of
1976
was
standing
harmlessly
on
a
back
street
of
detroit.
in
making
that
statement
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
certainly
it
was
not
a
terry
stop
and
it
was
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
10:00
pm,
it
was
at
10:00
o'clock
at
night,
but
it
was
made
very
clear
in
the
cross
examination
of
the
police
officer,
officer
bednark
at
the
preliminary
examination
that
there
was
no
fear
of
weapons
that
the
arrest
was
being
made
for
no
other
reason
other
than
the
fact
that
mr.
defillippo
did
not
satisfy
the
particular
standards
of
that
police
officer
regarding
his
identification.
we
would
submit
that
the
statement
of
facts
which
mr.
baughman
has
presented
to
the
court
while
those
statements
can
be
interpreted
from
the
facts
it
can
be
interpreted
from
the
some
what
sketchy
record
before
us
that
mr.
defillippo
did
indeed
attempt
to
identify
himself
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
that.
certainly
mr.
defillippo
in
a
city,
the
size
of
a
city
of
detroit
would
not
know
the
police
officer
personally.
by
stating
to
officer
bednark,
i
am
gary
defillippo,
if
he
certainly
did
not
have
with
him
a
driver's
license,
that
statement
would
certainly
not
satisfy
this
ordinance
if
officer
bednark
said,
well,
i
don't
know
that
you
are
gary
defillippo,
you
don't
have
some
piece
of
identification
a
draft
card,
you
don't
have
a
birth
certificate,
you
don't
have
a
credit
card.
now
gary
defillippo
allegedly
talked
about
the
subject
of
a
sergeant
mash.
the
question
i
think
that
remains
unresolved
is
what
did
gary
defillippo
actually
say,
i
don't
think
that
that
has
ever
been
clarified
because
the
police
officer
perceived
at
first
mr.
defillippo
to
say
i
am
sergeant
mash,
the
police
officer
admitted
subsequently
that
mr.
defillippo
may
well
have
said
to
him,
i
work
for
sergeant
mash
or
i
know
sergeant
mash.
there
are
actually
three
explanations
to
the
two
questions.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
yes
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
although
the
question
was
not
explored
fully
at
the
preliminary
exam
stage
officer
bednark
was
asked
whether
in
fact
there
was
an
officer
mash,
there
is
an
officer
by
that
approximate
name
working
for
the
detroit
police
department
and
if
i
could
be
allowed,
an
informal
offer
of
proof
before
this
court.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
alright
but
the
question
having
been
was
that
in
fact
accurate,
i
wanted
to
answer
by
responding
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
that
there
was
certain
proof
that
mr.
defillippo
did
in
fact
work
for
sergeant
mash.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
would
agree
with
that.
the
only
point
that
we
make
on
that
is
that
it
is
not
100%
certain
that
mr.
defillippo
did
in
fact
continue
to
represent
to
the
officer
that
he
was
in
fact
a
fellow
detroit
police
officer.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
no
i
am
not,
what
i
am
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
what
i
would
say
merely
is
that
the
joint
appendix
filed
with
the
court
makes
three
references
to
the
answer
given
by
mr.
defillippo.
one,
i
am
sergeant
mash,
two
i
work
for
sergeant
mash
and
three,
i
know
sergeant
mash
and
the
only
that
we
make
is
that
it
is
not
crystal
clear
exactly
what
response
mr.
defillippo
was
making
to
the
police
officer.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
police
officer
could
have
been
suspicious.
i
have
no
problem
with
the
fact
that
the
police
officer
may
have
been
suspicious
and
may
have
had
his
suspicions
aroused
as
to
who
in
fact
is
this
man.
however
we
do
point
out
that
we
do
not
believe
that
the
record
would
indicate
the
criminal
activity
portion
of
the
argument
which
mr.
baughman
makes.
mr.
defillippo
was
not
shown
to
even
be
in
close
proximity
to
the
young
lady.
mr.
defillippo
was
not
shown
to
be
doing
anything
which
had
a
sexual
overtone
about
it.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
they
may
have
although
mr.
justice
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
difficulty--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
difficulty
that
i
have
had
with
this
particular
proposition
and
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
in
the
state
of
michigan
probable
cause
is
not
sufficient
to
arrest
for
an
ordinance
violation,
an
officer
must
have
actual
proof
of
the
existence
of
an
ordinance
violation.
this
is
not
a
felony.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
certainly
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
went
directly
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance.
and
it
has
not
yet
this
morning
been
discussed
the
problem
of
the
particular
vagueness
of
the
ordinance
in
question
which
is
what
i
would
like
to
turn
to.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
while
they
did
find
that
the
statute
was
perhaps
overbroad
and
then
use
the
terminology
that
the
statute,
the
ordinance
made
criminal
what
was
otherwise
innocent
conduct,
i
don't
believe
and
i
would
agree
with
mr.
baughman
that
that
in
and
of
itself
would
not
be
a
sufficient
reason
to
strike
down
the
ordinance.
however,
we
would
submit
that
when
a
statute
takes
very
presumptively
innocent
conduct
such
as
a
person
walking
from
his
own
home
to
go
up
to
the
corner
to
buy
a
newspaper,
that
when
a
statute
can
make
that
conduct
potentially
illegal
it
must
do
so
in
terms
which
are
clear,
in
terms
in
which
the
ordinary
man
of
average
intelligence
will
have
no
difficulty
understanding
and
we
submit
that
the
detroit
common
counsel
in
august
of
1976
in
passing
this
particular
ordinance
did
not
set
any
such
standards.
the
standard
in
the
ordinance
itself
uses
the
term
identification
without
any
explanation
of
what
will
be
sufficient
or
what
will
be
reasonable
identification.
i
would
submit
that
there
are
many
citizens
in
the
city
of
detroit
who
by
their
age
or
by
their
lack
of
a
particular
occupation
are
going
to
be
unable
to
have
a
really
much
of
any
identification
at
all.
this
ordinance
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
passed
simultaneously
with
a
curfew
ordinance
in
the
city
of
detroit
and
when
one
reads
the
preamble
to
the
ordinance,
one
sees
that
this
ordinance
was
aimed
at
the
curbing
of
juvenile
gangs
in
detroit.
there
are
going
to
certainly
many
people
who
are
12
or
13
years
old
who
could
be
on
the
streets
of
detroit
and
be
unable
to
provide
any
identification
whatsoever.
there
are
going
to
be
many
people
who
will
substantially
older
than
that,
who
will
happen
not
to
have
their
drivers
license
with
them,
or
happen
not
to
carry
a
birth
certificate
with
them.
those
people
should
they
be
unfortunate
enough
to
be
standing
innocently
in
the
area
of
suspicious
activity,
stand
to
be
arrested
by
detroit
police
officers.
the
ordinance
also
talks
in
terms
of
unable
to
provide
and
refuse
to
provide.
you
maybe
detained
in
either
instance
under
the
detroit
ordinance,
certainly
you
maybe
arrested
if
the
officer
feels
that
you
have
refused
to
provide
identification,
you
maybe
detained
for
merely
being
unable
to,
therefore
a
person
who
himself
was
the
victim
of
a
crime
will
had
his
wallet
taken.
a
person
who
is
on
a
public
beach,
in
a
bathing
area,
these
people
will
probably
not
refuse
to
provide
identification
to
police
officers,
but
clearly
they
would
be
unable
to
provide
identification
to
police
officer.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
unclear
under
the
detroit
ordinance.
the
ordinance
when
originally
written
and
the
ordinance
that
we
deal
with
today
did
not
discuss
whether
the
identification
need
be
written
or
oral,
however
there
was
evidence
before
the
detroit
common
counsel
in
the
way
of
testimony
on
the
day
that
the
ordinance
was
passed,
showing
that
some
of
the
proponents
of
that
ordinance
felt
that
written
identification
would
be
required.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
correct,
but
it
would
allow
a
detention.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
no,
but
it
would
be
an
inability
and
it
could
cause
his
detention.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
no
it
would
not.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
you
have
mr.
justice
rehnquist
eliminated
many
people
but
certainly
not
all
people
because
anybody
who
is
in
the
vicinity
of
criminal
activity
might
be
considered
to
be
in
a
suspicious
circumstance,
such
as
mr.
defillippo.
we
would
concede
that
the
young
lady
in
question
was
almost
undoubtedly
engaged
in
some
type
of
illegal
activity.
i
think
the
actual
arrest
was
disorderly
conduct
due
to
consumption
of
alcohol.
however,
mr.
defillippo
could
have
been
an
aider
and
abettor
in
a
situation
of
public
intoxication.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
record
is
unclear,
the
record
merely
states
that
the
officers
observed
two
people.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
answer
which
i
gave
earlier
stating
that
many
people
could
have
been
involved
would
not
necessarily
apply
to
the
particular
situation
in
defillippo,
but
in
many
situations
which
could
occur.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
understand.
i
merely
i
am
addressing
that
to
difficulties
with
the
application
of
this
ordinance
generally,
that
it
could
be
used
in
many
ways
to
cause
wholesale
arrests
of
people
who
are
in
the
vicinity
of
what
was
suspicious
criminal
activity,
which
is
one
of
the
potential
first
amendment
problems
with
the
ordinance.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
material
witness
statute
in
the
state
of
michigan
which
would
allow
detention
of
people
on
the
street,
however
applying
your
question
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
correct
the
and
certainly,
if
this
had
been
a
felony
arrest
as
opposed
to
misdemeanor
arrest,
the
officer
would
have
the
obligation
to
produce
res
gestae
witnesses
and
mr.
defillippo
could
have
been
considered
a
res
gestae
witness
to
whatever
crime
the
young
lady
was
being
arrested
for,
but
the
young
lady
arrested
for
a
misdemeanor
and
there
is
no
res
gestae
rule
in
the
state
of
michigan
which
requires
the
police
officer
to
ascertain
the
names
of
all
parties
in
the
presence
of
a
misdemeanor
arrest.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
yes.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
evidence
in
the
record
comes
form
two
sources.
it
comes
generally
form
the
way
in
which
this
particular
ordinance
was
passed.
the
particular
emergency
and
response
to
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
we
had
hoped
to
included
in
the
brief
before
the
court
under
the
principle
of
a
brandeis
brief
and
that
it
is
documented
material
that
we
have
put
into
the
statement
of
facts,
and
we
had
asked
the
court
to
consider
that.
however,
what
could
be
considered
part
of
the
record
is
that
we
know
what
the
ordinance
stated
and
there
are
decisions,
there
are
two
decisions
in
the
michigan
supreme
court
that
would
indicate
that
the
detroit
common
council
was
acting
in
an
area
which
was
preempted
by
state
law
to
begin
with
and
we
had
presumed
that
the
michigan
common
council
was
aware
of
the
state
of
law
in
the
state
of
michigan,
that
they
could
not
use
ignorance
of
michigan
supreme
court
decisions
principally,
the
decision
in
walsh
versus
city
of
river
rouge.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
no
and
the
reason
for
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
well,
the
issue
was
raised
before
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
but
not
reached,
and
we
thought
that
under
the
position
of
this
court
in
smith
versus
(inaudible),
a
fact
that
if
facts
as
we
allege
them
are
true,
that
perhaps
the
matter
should
be
remanded
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
to
reach
that
question,
it
has
been
raised
before
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
a
state
preemption
problem
involved
in
this
case,
that
ordinance
violations
dealing
with
emergency
situations.
in
other
word
riots
or
states
of
emergency
in
the
cities
in
the
state
of
michigan
is
a
matter,
which
is
particularly
reserved
to
the
state
government
and
had
been
so
held
since
the
early
1960s
and
it
was
raised
for
that
reason.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
yes
mr.
justice
powell
we
did
--
the
state.
we
did
state
that
if
one
reads
the
ordinance
section
which
follows
the
particular
ordinance
here,
that
section
states
that
if
an
arrest
is
made
under
section
52.3,
that
all
the
police
officer
can
do
is
make
a
pat-down
for
dangerous
weapons.
so
the
officer
was
specifically
excluded
under
the
same
law
that
he
sought
to
enforce
to
make
a
full
blown
search
for
any
fruits
of
any
crimes
and
yet
the
officer
admitted
that
he
was
not
making
a
pat-down
merely
for
weapons
but
that
he
was
going
beyond
that
and
we
would
maintain
that
the
officer
then
was
in
a
very
similar
position
to
the
officer
in
sibron
versus
new
york
and
that
he
was
not
looking
for
weapons
as
he
was
allowed
to
do
under
stop-and-frisk
statute
but
was
in
fact
looking
for
drugs
and
in
fact
find
drugs
and
that
is
where
we
allege
that
if
the
good
faith
issue
is
to
be
considered
that
there
is
a
high
potential
of
a
lack
of
good
faith
on
the
officials
who
put
this
particular
situation
into
existence.
that
would
be
both
the
counsel
and
the
officer
involved.
this
court
has
been
asked
to
consider
the
case
of
almeida-sanchez
and
how
it
applies
to
the
instant
situation
and
we
maintain
before
this
court
that
the
almeida-sanchez
decision
is
actually
dispositive
of
the
case
at
bar,
that
there
is
not
an
actual
difference
that
can
be
found.
the
petitioner
has
alleged
that
the
difference
is
that
almeida-sanchez
was
a
statute
which
authorized
searches
and
that
was
as
opposed
to
the
ordnance
in
detroit,
which
does
not
specifically
authorize
searches
but
actually
defines
criminal
conduct.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
think
they
did
not.
the
ordinance
might
appear
to
allow
for
full
searches
on
suspicion,
the
difficulty
is
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
don't
know
that
we
would
necessarily
be
compelled
to
accept
the
ruling
of
the
state
court
on
that.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
would
be
correct
under
the
robison
decision.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
following
section
to
the
ordinance,
the
ordinance
in
question
is
ordinance
number
52.3,
the
following
section
is
section
52.4,
section
52.4
is
the
section
which
states
that
if
an
arrest
is
made
under
section
52.3.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
correct
as
the
law
now
stands.
section
52.4
in
time
preceded
section
52.3.
therefore
when
section
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
it
was
enforced,
it
is
still
enforced
today.
it
has
never
been
taken
off
of
the
ordinance
even
when
section
52.3
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
no,
and
the
reason
i
believe
for
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correctly
holding
that
under
united
states
versus
robinson,
once
an
arrest
is
made
even
for
a
traffic
stop,
even
for
an
ordinance
violation,
this
court
has
held
that
a
full
search
maybe
made
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
correct
and
we
believe
that
under
section
52.4
the
city
officers
actually
were
restricted
from
doing
anything
other
than
making
a
terry
type
pat-down.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
tin
foil
packet
was
found
on
the
scene,
tin
foil
packet
was
not
searched
to
determine
the
presence
of
phencyclidine
until
he
got
to
the
station
house.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
correct.
although
it
does
not
go
beyond
what
has
been
allowed
under
traditional
fourth
amendment
principles
announced
in
the
robinson
case.
this
court
has
on
many
occasions
faced
the
situation
of
a
claim
or
a
presumed
claim
that
an
officer
has
acted
in
good
faith
under
an
executive,
under
a
legislative
or
under
a
judicial
ruling
of
the
state
from
which
the
officer
comes.
to
rule
that
good
faith
reliance
upon
executive
action,
upon
legislative
action
or
upon
judicial
action
within
the
state
renders
that
conduct
higher
than
the
fourth
amendment
would
require
in
our
position,
the
overruling
of
almeida-sanchez
case,
would
require
the
overruling
of
this
court's
decision
in
berger
versus
new
york
and
which
a
wiretapping
warrant
was
specifically
allowed
under
a
state
statute
even
though
the
standards
set
down
by
that
statute
were
too
vague
to
be
allowed
under
fourth
amendment
principles
would
require
the
overruling
of
the
case
of
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire,
the
attorney
general
warrants
which
were
specially
allowed
by
state
statute
would
require
an
overruling
of
at
least
the
reasoning
which
was
presented
in
the
case
of
mincey
versus
arizona.
the
reliance
and
i
am
certain
that
had
been
good
faith
reliance
upon
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state
allowing
an
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
perceive
them
as
being
more
similar.
the
question
is
certainly
one
of
degree
as
opposed
to
one
of
kind.
this
court
has
stated
that
if
a
state
legislature
or
a
town
counsel
were
to
pass
an
ordinance
saying
that
police
officers
could
arrest
all
suspicious
persons
that
that
would
not
pass
constitutional
muster.
certainly
there
will
be
different
gradations
of
that
problem,
certain
degrees
but
i
think
that
the
case
at
bar
is
a
merely
a
case
of
degree.
you
have
an
a
statute
or
an
ordinance
very
much
like
the
loitering
statues
and
you
have
one
that
has
no
standards
that
a
police
officer
can
even
rely
on
in
good
faith.
if
the
police
officer
cannot
point
to
some
standards
upon
which
he
relied
the
question
of
his
good
faith
becomes
very
difficult
to
ascertain.
if
you
cannot
ascertain
whether
he
truly
had
good
faith
or
not,
we
might
be
in
a
position
of
saying
that
since
all
state
statutes
and
all
ordinances
are
presumptively
valid
the
police
officers
can
make
arrest
and
make
full
blown
searches
on
any
ordinance
that's
passed
until
such
time
as
that
ordinance
can
be
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
there
should
not
be
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
agree.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
would
think
not
and
the
difference
being
that
we
will
be
talking
about
a
statute
which
i
perceive
to
have
been
something
this
court
has
discussed
as
a
technical
violation
of
the
constitution
as
opposed
to
what
this
court
talked
about
in
sibron
versus
new
york
being
those
statutes
which
themselves
trench
on
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
hypothetical
case
which
you
have
presented
would
certainly
not
trench
on
any
fourth
amendment
rights
directly
in
the
statute.
we
submit
that
the
detroit
ordinance
did
so
by
setting
up
a
vague,
setting
up
an
ambiguous
statute,
setting
up
one
that
did
not
have
standards
and
which
allowed
police
officers
at
mere
whim
and
caprice
to
make
arrest
under
a
speeding
statute
of
course
a
police
officer
would
have
to
be
able
to
point
to
the
fact
of
why
specifically
the
person
was
going
over
the
speed
limit,
how
he
determined
that
and
i
think
that
he
would
have
excellent
standards
upon
which
he
could
base
that
determination.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
vagueness
and
over
breath
can.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
they
are
due
process
arguments.
the
standard
however
is
that
since
a
warrantless
arrest
depends
on
the
validity
of
the
arrest
to
determine
probable
cause
when
the
arrest
cannot
ever
be
found
to
be
valid
because
there
are
no
standards
then
you
have
a
warrantless
arrest
which
is
in
itself
unreasonable.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
standard
would
not
deal
with
the
terry
standard
as
much
as
would
deal
with
the
identification
standard
which
is
the,
which
is
the
real
problem.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
vagueness
dealing
with
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
the
standard
dealing
with,
whether
the
citizen
will
know
when
he
must
provide
identification
no
i
do
agree
with
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
on
that.
it
must
be
--
mr.
james
c.
howarth
i
don't
know
that
the
terry
standard
gave
no
recognition
to
the
fact
that
a
citizen
must
answer
questions
and
i
have
--
we
have
no
objection
with
the
right
of
the
police
officer
to
ask
questions
of
the
citizen,
it
the
question
of
whether
the
citizen
must
be
compelled
to
answer.
mr.
james
c.
howarth
well,
we
had
interpreted
it
as
being
the
really
the
arrest
--
