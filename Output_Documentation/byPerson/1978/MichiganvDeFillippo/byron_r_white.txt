justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
the
defendant
refused
to
identify
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
looking
backwards
that's
right
i
guess,
yeah.
so
what
if
a
man
he
asked
a
person
--
asking
him
name,
he
gives
you
a
name,
has
he
violated
the
ordinance
if
it
later
turns
out
that
it
was
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
in,
that
is
also
a
part
of
the
ordinance
you
are
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
totally
different
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
say
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation
or
that
the
evidence
shouldn't
be
excluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
said
the
first,
well
they
would
say
the
second
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there
had
been
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
must,
you
certainly
must
not
only
say
there
is
a
grounds
for
a
terry
stop
search
but
there
must
have
been
grounds
for
an
arrest
and
a
search.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
this
--
so
was
there
any
question,
ever
any
question
in
this
case
raised
about
the
grounds
for
the
so
called
stop?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
case
did
you
mention
justice
powell's
concurring
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
the
author
of
stone
against
powell.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
cases
held
or
do
you
know
many
cases
where
there
has
been
a
terry
stop
has
anyone
ever
held
that
as
soon
you'd
stop
and
make
a
terry
stop
you
must
get
miranda
warnings?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
baughman,
at
the
time
the
officer
first
approached
the
respondent,
was
there
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
he
was
engaged
in
criminal
activity?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
criminal
activity
by
the
respondent?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
in
the
testimony
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
your
supposition
that
found
in
the
alley
--
you
might
have
assumed
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
her
purpose
was
explained
to
something
quite
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
soon
as
they
asked
her.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
standing
there
and
he
was
fully
clothed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
suggest
that,
you
could
make
a
criminal
refuse
to
give
their
name
to
any
officer
who
just
happens
to
stop
you
in
the
street.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
baughman
you
seem
to
assume
that
if
here
were
no
criminal
connection
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
ordinance
to
require
or
to
authorize
a
police
and
to
just
go
up
to
a
citizen
in
the
corner
right
in
front
of
the
court
house,
say
what's
your
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
could
a
make
a
crime
for
the
citizen
to
refuse
to
tell
him.
you
say
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
constitutional
objection
to
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
it's
a
due
process
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
there
be
a
fourth
amendment
issue
though
if
the,
without
any
reason
whatsoever
the
officer
went
up
to
a
person
and
detained
him
while
he
ask
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
walked
up
and
walked
along
side
of
him,
and
just
followed
him
along
and
asked
him
what
his
name
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
can
do
certainly
that
there
is
no
problem
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
identity
if
the
person
said
no
i
give
it
you
and
then
if
he
arrested
and
you
think
then
there
is
a
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
when
the
draft
was
enforced
that
was
a
violation
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
an
officer
walked
up
to
somebody
and
said
let
me
see
your
draft
card
and
person
said
awfully
sorry,
but
it's
none
of
your
business.
if
there
was
a
statute,
that
made
that
a
crime,
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
agree
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
proceeded
on
the
basis
at
least
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
for
a
stop
and
then
also
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
under
the
ordinance
and
then
struck
down
the
ordinance.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
have
been
passed
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so
but
the,
i
don't
know,
suppose
the
michigan
appellate
court
would
just
unnecessarily
breach
the
constitutional
question
then
would
abide
on
by
these
preliminary
questions,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
a
moment,
how
you
interpret
this
statement
of
the
appellate
court,
you
can
probably
explain
it.
it
says
that
detroit
ordinance
sanctions
full
searches
on
suspicion
without
regard
for
dangerousness
of
those
persons
whose
activities
fall
within
the
vague
parameters
of
the
ordinance.
now
does
it
read
the
ordinance
the
way
you
do
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aren't
we
rather,
shouldn't
we
take
for
granted
that
what
the
statute
means
if
such
state
court
has
construed
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
apparently,
that
maybe
true
under
the
fourth
amendment
but
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
the
state
has
in
this
very
ordinance
has
restricted
the
officer's
freedom
to
make
a
full
search
even
if
he
makes
a
valid
arrest
under
this
ordinance.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
if
you
arrest
a
person
for
refusing
to
identify
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
52.4
enforced
that
time
this
arrest
was
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
suggesting
that
under
state
law
this
ordinance,
this
search
was
invalid
even
if
the
ordinance
was,
even
if
the
ordinance
was
valid,
even
if
the
arrest
was
valid,
the
search
was
invalid
because
of
52.4.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
as
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned
but
certainly
it
doesn't
say
that
a
state
may
not
restrict
the
power
of
its
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this,
the
substance
for
the
possession
of
which
he
was
prosecuted
was
found
on
package
of
cigarettes
after
he
was
taken
to
the
station
house,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
the,
do
you
think
the
search
that
found
the
tin
foil
went
beyond
the
search
that
the
ordinance
authorized
for
a
valid
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
are
suggesting
is
that
any
statute
that
happen
to
pick
up
the
standard
that
terry
announced
would
be
unconstitutionally
vague.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
aren't
defending
the
other
part
then
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
opinion
on
vagueness.
justice
byron
r.
white
standard,
no
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
just
must
means,
that
just
means
that
the
terry
standard
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
might
also
ask
or
say
that
your
52.4
just
says,
seems
to
me
that
if,
if
you
make
a
kind
of
a
stop,
a
52.3
contemplate
so
you
may
pat
him
down
if
you
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
dangerous.
it
doesn't
say
that
if
he
refuses
to
identify
and
then
you
arrest
him
that
you
can't
make
a
full
search.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
apparently
you
do
interpret
it
that
way,
but
that
certainly
isn't
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
it.
