justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
come
back
to
the
sort
of
what
happened
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
did
the
pat-down
occur
before
or
after
the
arrest?
justice

f.
powell,

after
the
arrest.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

and
would
you
state
again
exactly
what
the
issue
is
before
us
is
the
validity
of
the
ordinance
before
us
in
this
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
we
could
hold
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
this
arrest
and
the
search
would
have
been
incident
to
that
arrest
and
would
end
the
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
we
were
to
reach
the
constitutional
question,
do
you
see
any
fifth
amendment
problem
here,
you
discussed
the
fourth
amendment,
is
there
a
fifth
amendment
problem
with
the
respect
to
an
ordinance
that
allows
an
officer
who
makes
a
crime
to
decline
to
identify
oneself
or
when
an
officer
is
arrested
for
any
purpose.

public
drunkenness
is
an
offence
in
detroit?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
howarth,
part
three
of
your
brief
you
state
and
argue
that
the
detroit
common
council
lacked
good
faith
in
enacting
this
ordinance.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
that
rather
serious
charge.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
this
in
the
record,
is
this
in
the
record?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
it
argued
to
the
michigan
court
that
the
police
officer
also
acted
in
bad
faith
another
charge
you
make
in
your
brief?
