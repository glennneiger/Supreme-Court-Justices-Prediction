justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
making
any
point
what
the
corporation
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
vote,
six
to
nothing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
on
a
corporation,
that
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
that
state
into
a
serve
by
removing
a
requirement
of
unanimity,
i
don't
quite
understand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
an
unfair
question
and
i
hope
it
hasn't
been
asked
when
i
was
out
of
the
room.
supposed
the
louisiana
statute
provided
for
a
seven-man
jury
and
the
vote
were
six
to
one,
do
you
think
under
the
result
in
ballew
that
that
conviction
would
hold
up
constitutionally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
the
10
out
of
12?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
in
ballew
many
members
of
the
court
weren't
very
impressed
with
what
they
called
the
numerology
of
the
studies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you're
less
impressed
to
hear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
ballew
wasn't
a
court
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
peebles,
i'm
not
being
critical
because
as
you
know
in
--
what
was
written
in
ballew
case,
i
gave
substantial
weight
to
the
studies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
everybody
was
in
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mrs.
korns,
is
it
speculation
--
do
you
contend
that
it
would
be
speculation
that
its
--
would
be
harder
to
persuade
five
out
of
five
to
convict
than
it
would
be
to
persuade
five
out
of
six
to
convict.
is
that
just
speculation
or
--
doesn't
seem
rather
obvious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
did
in
this
time
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
could
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
that
really
--
it
does
not
respond
to
my
question.
my
question
is
to
compare
the
requirement
of
unanimity
in
a
five-man
jury
which
the
court
has
held
is
not
enough.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
the
requirement
of
getting
five
out
of
six
to
convict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
not
agree
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
that
it's
easier
to
get
five
out
of
six
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
finish
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
--
would
you
not
agree
that
its
easier
to
get
five
out
of
six
to
convict
than
it
is
to
get
five
out
of
five
to
convict?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
think
it
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
i'd
like
you
to
answer
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
understand,
you
just
don't
want
to
answer
my
question.
i
don't
suppose
the
answer
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
(voice
overlap),
that's
probably
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
case,
do
not
answer
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
asking
you
whether
you
think
we
need
statistics
to
demonstrate
what
i
regard
as
a
rather
obvious
proposition
that
it
would
be
harder
to
persuade
five
out
of
five
to
convict
than
it
would
be
to
persuade
five
out
of
six
to
convict?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
your
argument
mrs.
korns,
i
--
you
say
my
question
is
totally
irrelevant
to
that
analysis.
but
under
your
analysis
then,
four
out
of
six
would
also
be
adequate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
still
have
your
six
people.
in
fact
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
three
out
of
six
would
be
adequate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact
i
don't
know
why
under
your
analysis
you
couldn't
have
a
jury
that
said
if
any
one
of
the
six
believes
he's
guilty,
that's
enough.
