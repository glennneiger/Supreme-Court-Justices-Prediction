mrs.
korns,
do
you
--
are
you
saying,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand,
i
haven't
read
that
particular
study
but
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
do
you
--
it
suggests
that
its
easier
for
the
prosecutor
to
get
a
conviction
when
he
asks
to
convince
12
people
to
agree
unanimously
than
it
is
to
convince
a
majority
of
six
persons?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
some
rather
improbable
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
but
is
he
advocating
it
on
the
ground
that
it
is
harder
to
persuade
a
majority
of
six
to
convict
than
it
is
to
persuade
all
12
of
the
12
man
jury
to
convict,
is
he
(voice
overlap)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
you
support
that
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
don't
know,
im
just
listening.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
wouldn't
understand
that
one
either
now.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
maybe
the
term
numerology
may
apply
to
what
he
wrote
rather
than
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
wrote.
