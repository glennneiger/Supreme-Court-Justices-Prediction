ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course,
it's
the
state
of
louisiana's
position
in
this
case
that
because
this
court
approved
a
six-man
jury
in
williams
versus
florida
in
majority
verdicts
when
a
substantial
number
of
the
jurors
agree
in
apodaca
cersus
oregon
and
johnson
versus
louisiana
that
a
five
out
of
six
jury
verdict
is
constitutionally
unassailable.
under
all
the
reasons
brought
forward
by
this
court
in
williams
and
apodaca
and
johnson
that
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
there
we
get
to
the
slippery
slope
argument
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
don't
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
our
position
your
honor
is
anchored
right
on
this
case.
we
have
a
six
member
jury
and
five
of
them
brought
back
a
verdict
and
that
the
defense
in
this
case
made
no
attempt.
i'd
like
to
jump
to
an
argument
that
was
made
during
my
predecessor's
argument
where
it
has
appeared
that
the
only
-
that
the
two
horns
of
the
dilemma
were
social
studies
on
one
side,
judicial
hunch
on
the
other.
it's
the
state
of
louisiana's
position
that
there's
a
third
position
and
it's
the
only
valuable
position
that
is
actual
court
studies
taken
--
which
take
place
not
grabbing
fifteen
cases
here
or
some
but
with
all
the
computers
and
everything
available
today
it
would
be
not
impossible
and
not
all
that
difficult
to
actually
put
into
the
computer
every
majority
verdict
to
case
in
louisiana
compared
to
a
light
number
of
cases
and
other
unanimous
jurisdictions.
this
has
never
been
done
although
this
court
suggested
in
johnson
versus
louisiana
that
until
such
evidence
was
presented
it
was
not
going
to
set
aside
the
judicial
--
the
will
of
the
louisiana
legislature
in
its
presumption
that
a
majority
verdict
was
perfectly
constitutional.
now,
let
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
he'll
be
particularly
interested
in
this
and
i
was
particularly
interested
in
it
because
of
his
reliance
on
empirical
data
in
ballew.
and
i
point
out
my
brief
that
the
data
is
sort
of
divided
not
completely
but
in
general
that
on
the
same
actual
life
studies
of
these
majority
verdicts
or
smaller
jury's
judicial
proceedings
favor
the
actual
or
in
place
studies
generally
favor
these
smaller
juries
and
these
majority
verdicts
where
the
mock
juries
and
deductive
modelling
ones
generally
tend
to
disfavor
them.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
coming
right
out
right
now
are
articles
by
professor
bernard
grofman,
associate
professor
of
social
scientist
at
the
university
of
california,
irvine.
he
has
brought
one
out
in
19
--
at
the
end
of
last
year
the
case
for
statistic
for
majority
verdict,
he's
bringing
more
now
right
now.
by
the
way
i
--
just
put
in
parenthesis,
he's
being
funded
in
this
by
the
national
science
foundation,
its
social
sciences
and
law
program.
he's
been
funded
in
this.
he's
brought
out
the
case
statistical
verdicts
--
i
mean,
from
majority
for
majority
verdicts,
the
statistical
case
of
majority
verdicts
and
two
other
articles
which
he
has
sent
to
this
court
barely.
but
anyway,
the
state
of
louisiana
does
not
want
the
court
to
rely
on
this
but
just
nearly
points
out
that
even
the
--
that
this
statistical
data
professes
are
sharply
divided.
they'll
--
professor
stewart
niegel
will
tell
you
by
all
kind
of
formulas
that
this
long
and
xs
and
parenthesis
that
the
chances
of
convicting
an
innocent
person
increase
as
you
get
five
out
of
six
whereas
professor
bernard
grofman
will
tell
you
by
these
other
formulas,
equally
lined
and
complicated
that
his
position
that
he
urges
in
these
articles
and
it's
surprising
anyway
because
it's
counter-intuitive
is
that
a
six
member
majority
verdict
jury
is
more
likely
to
protect
the
innocent
than
a
12
member
unanimous
verdict
jury.
now,
i'm
not
telling
this
court
this
because
i
urge
them
to
rely
on
this.
i'm
just
telling
them
this
to
show
them
that
the
disarray
that
exist
among
this
theoretical
thinkers
on
the
subject
and
our
position
is,
if
the
national
science
foundation
can
fund
a
statistical
research
program
like
this,
why
can't
they
fund
a
naturally
in
place
study
of
what
actually
happens
in
louisiana
under
the
majority
verdict
system
that'll
go
on
for
maybe
three
or
four
years
and
collect
actual
hard
figures.
so
that
we'll
no
longer
be
speculating
about
what
happens
but
we'll
see
what
happens
but
--
ms.
louise
korns
just
coming
out.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
and
i'm
just
telling
you
what
--
ms.
louise
korns
--
professor
bernard
grofman's
article
is
one
of
the
things
that
he
proves
with
these
formulas
that
he
--
he
advances,
he
concludes,
does
it
so,
that
--
well
first
of
all,
i
have
to
admit
in
all
honesty
that
he
prefers
a
12
man
jury
to
a
six-man
jury.
but
his
proposition
is
that
if
this
court
finds
a
certain
group
of
people
constitutionally
adequate
or
six-man
jury
like
in
williams
versus
florida
then
there's
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
the
majority
verdict.
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
advocate
a
simple
majority.
simple
majority
which
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
apparently
he
is
your
honor
but
i
don't
understand
all
his
formulas.
ms.
louise
korns
your
honor,
as
i
say
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
don't
understand
these
mathematical
formulas
--
ms.
louise
korns
--
just
to
tell
you
the
truth.
i
know
--
i
don't
have
any
mathematical
background
and
all
of
these
articles
are
great
to
me
as
far
as
the
underlying
reasoning
goes.
ms.
louise
korns
i'm
--
i
just
site
this
to
this
court
as
i
say
because
his
professor
stuart
nagel
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
louise
korns
oh,
he
is
not
--
ms.
louise
korns
right.
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
--
excuse
me,
i
think
he
is
working
though
not
on
actual
court
studies
at
all,
that's
what
i'm
telling
you.
this
is
one
of
those
fanciful
things.
he
is
working
on
figures
that
he
gleans
just
like
professor
stuart
nagel
does
from
ziffle,
you
know,
i'd
forgotten
it,
kelvin
and
ziffle
taken,
will
death
--
what
all
these
other
people
did
taking
these
figures
out
of
that
then
getting
their
computers
out
and
working
out
all
this
formulas.
but
anyway,
as
i
say,
i
just
mentioned
it
to
this
court
because
i
think
particularly
mr.
justice
blackmun
would
be
interested
in
this
articles
because
they
are
coming
right
out
in
the
university
of
california
and
they
were
right
on
this
point.
but
fortunately
for
us,
they
are
on
our
side
this
time.
anyway,
the
states
whole
position
is
--
in
this
case,
state
of
louisiana's
whole
position
in
this
case
of
course
is
that
under
williams
and
under
johnson
and
apodaca,
a
five
out
of
six
jury,
it
is
perfectly
constitutional.
we
feel
that
if
any
kind
of
data
are
going
to
be
used
against
our
position,
we
feel
that
at
least
these
experts
ought
to
be
put
on
the
witness
stand
in
the
trial
court
qualified
as
experts
like
a
doctor,
anybody
who's
going
to
testify
about
insanity.
give
testimony
the
same
kind
as
a
right
in
these
articles
and
be
subjected
to
cross-examination
on
conflicting
articles.
just
like
as
a
psychiatrist
is
when
he
gets
up
and
testifies
about
insanity.
we
feel
that
if
louisiana's
majority
verdict
is
going
to
be
thrown
aside,
it
ought
to
be
on
concrete
evidence
showing
that
unfairness
is
--
results
and
not
on
speculation
which
is
just
in
the
realm
of
very
interesting
theories
but
which
have
never
been
--
ms.
louise
korns
our
position
is
in
a
five
out
of
six
jury
justice
stevens
which
is
what
we
have
here,
this
jury
which
would
have
reach
the
unanimity,
95%
of
them.
in
other
words
--
ms.
louise
korns
they
didn't
this
time
but
if
a
six-man
jury,
five
of
whom
--
if
a
six-man
jury
have
to
be
unanimous
they're
going
to
become
unanimous
95%
of
the
time.
ms.
louise
korns
and
once
the
vote
reaches
one
to
five,
it's
not
going
to
--
the
one
is
not
going
to
turn
around
the
five.
ms.
louise
korns
so
all
he's
going
to
get
is
a
5%
chance
of
a
hung
jury
and
the
state
can
try
him
again
and
have
just
as
good
--
i
mean,
a
very
(inaudible).
so,
what
is
he
losing
really?
ms.
louise
korns
right.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
i
understand,
yes.
ms.
louise
korns
right.
ms.
louise
korns
in
other
words
why
if
ballew
is
no
good
--
ms.
louise
korns
--
aren't
we
any
good.
ms.
louise
korns
oh,
your
honor
i'm
going
to
avoid
that
question
because
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue.
the
issue
here
is
one,
--
ms.
louise
korns
--
is
the
six-man
panel.
ms.
louise
korns
the
issue
we
think
is,
is
a
six-man
panel
valid
as
a
cross-section
of
the
community
as
a
protection
against
tyranny
is
--
so
and
so,
which
this
court
not
only
found
in
williams
but
upheld
and
reaffirmed
in
ballew.
ms.
louise
korns
we
rely
--
ms.
louise
korns
we
rely
--
alright,
we
rely
on
apodaca
versus
oregon
and
johnson
versus
louisiana
and
when
the
present
louisiana
constitution
would
--
ms.
louise
korns
whether
its
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes.
but
this
court
didn't
strike
down
the
five
out
of
five
jury
on
that
basis,
it
struck
it
down
because
it
wasn't
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community.
ms.
louise
korns
that
when
you
get
below
six,
you
--
so,
that
--
respectfully,
i
don't
think
that's
an
issue
here
because
of
the
reasons
of
striking
down
ballew
are
not
here.
this
court
said
in
ballew,
you've
got
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
and
you
withdraw
it
at
six.
and
we
reaffirm
our
holding
in
williams
and
williams
--
a
six-man
jury
gives
a
sufficient
cross-section
of
the
population,
provides
a
bullock
against
tyranny.
as
a
number
of
--
ms.
louise
korns
of
course,
--
ms.
louise
korns
of
course
in
williams
this
court
said
--
the
whole
argument
was
how
far
are
we
going
to
go?
ms.
louise
korns
well,
most
--
even
scotland,
scotland
from
time
immemorial
has
had
a
bare
majority
verdict.
and
as
i
say
there
are
people
who
argue
like
this
professor
grofman
that
once
a
jury
has
swung
to
a
bare
majority,
the
chances
that's
it
going
to
go
back
--
oh,
so
infinitesimal
that
you
may
as
well
come
out
then.
i
don't
take
any
position
on
that
because
that's
not
my
case
and
in
williams
i
think
members
of
this
court
asked,
“how
far
down
are
we
going
to
go?”
and
the
answer
in
that
case
was,
“we'll
stop
at
some
time.”
and
in
ballew
they
--
this
court
stopped
it.
now,
i
don't
think
its
--
frankly,
a
question
here
that
if
you
up
hold
five
out
of
six
then,
you're
going
to
have
to
--
i
mean
its
clear
from
ballew
where
you
drew
the
line
under
williams
that
if
uphold
five
out
of
six,
doesn't
mean
at
all
that
you
have
to
uphold
anything
more
under
that.
and
having
upheld
ten
out
of
twelve
in
apodaca,
five
out
of
six
is
just
half
of
it
and
even
i
can
understand
that.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
this
court
has
said
you
can
go
below
six
so
obviously
we're
not
going
to
get
six.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
your
honor.
we
have
six,
five
out
of
six
where
i
mean,
we
have
to
have
a
six-man
jury.
ms.
louise
korns
right.
ms.
louise
korns
the
total
number
and
reaffirmed
williams
many
times.
mr.
justice
blackmun
said,
“we
reaffirmed
everything
we
said
in
williams
as
far
as
it
been
16
enough
and
6
rep
--
serving
all
these
important
constitutional
functions
of
a
jury.”
ms.
louise
korns
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
this
case
that
obviously
the
vote
of
one
did
count
and
he
was
listened
to
because
the
jury
deliberated
for
15
minutes.
it
was
unanimous
from
the
corporation
and
five
to
one
for
burch.
now,
those
very
facts
show
that
the
juror's
one
vote
did
count.
he
voted
one
way
and
one
and
one
the
other.
and
it's
really
--
i
mean,
its
obvious
just
from
those
facts
that
they
listened
to
him,
that
he
voted
one
way
and
one
and
one
on
the
other
and
that
his
--
that
he
never
would've
turned
around
the
other
five
in
the
burch
case.
ms.
louise
korns
no
doubt
about
that,
absolutely.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
if
this
court
--
the
members
of
this
court
don't
have
any
further
questions
i'll
submit
the
matter
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
grofman?
ms.
louise
korns
no,
i
said
that
both
professor
nagel
and
kelvin,
and
ziffel
and
everybody
agreed
that
it
was
--
ms.
louise
korns
no
--
if
i've
said
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
nobody
has
ever
kept
--
that's
my
very
point
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
oh,
95%
of
the
time,
they
would
under
general
rules
of
way
jurors
behave.
ms.
louise
korns
the
--
and
the
others
are
tired
of
listening
to
it
and
they
either
bully
or
persuade
the
other
person
to
give
in
just
like
in
the
old
days,
they
wouldn't
give
him
any
light,
heat,
a
food
and
they
drag
him
from
courts
from
one
stand
to
the
other
until
finally
they
all
say
--
ms.
louise
korns
we'd
like
to,
i
think
your
honor
but
we
can't.
thank
you
your
honors.
