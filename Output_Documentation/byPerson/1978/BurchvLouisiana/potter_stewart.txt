including
a
not
guilty
verdict,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
the
six
could
be
for
the
finding
of
guilty
but
of
the
other
five
are
for
a
finding
of
not
guilty,
that's
the
verdict?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
five
out
of
just
--
could
say,
lets
say
it
was
negro
defendant
and
one
of
the
six
jurors
were
a
negro.
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
five
others
could
just
say
will
you
go
there
and
play
solitary
in
the
quarter
and
we
will
decide
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
all
that
the
court
can
do
is
deal
with
the
system.
with
the
rule
you
can't
deal
with
individual
jurors
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
even
with
the
12
member
unanimous
jury
you
might
have
12
peas
in
the
pot.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
any
particular
jury
didn't
know
cross-section
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
but
one
deals
with
the
system.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
court
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
--
your
reasoning
then,
four
out
of
seven
would
be
unassailable
too.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
--
since
we've
approved
a
six
member
jury,
then
a
fortiori
we
would
have
approved
a
seven
member
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
that's
all
of
this,
just
the
numbers
then
four
out
of
seven
would
--
as
i
understand
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
may
be.
justice
potter
stewart
it
may
be
that
a
prosecutor
and
the
jurisdiction
that
he
studied
doesn't
bring
a
case
for
violation
of
the
misdemeanors
that
have
six-man
jury
unless
the
proof
of
guilt
is
overwhelming.
justice
potter
stewart
or
if
he
does,
bring
felony
prosecutions
if
there's
probable
cause
to
bring
the
prosecution
before
a
12
member
jury.
there
are
all
sorts
of
facts
that
could
skew
those
findings.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly
your
honor.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
two
out
of
three
would
be
even
better.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
you're
five
in
your
state.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
vote
of
one
of
them
doesn't
count,
it
isn't
six?
does
it
even
know
that
person
maybe
sitting
in
the
back?
justice
potter
stewart
i
call
the
people
who
voted
for
outland
in
1936,
their
votes
were
counted
but
frank
d.
roosevelt
was
president.
