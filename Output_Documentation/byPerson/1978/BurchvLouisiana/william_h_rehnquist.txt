justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
theory
then
any
one
who
is
convicted
in
louisiana
under
this
particular
section
of
the
constitution
even
though
by
a
unanimous
six
men
jury
or
six
person
jury
would
be
entitled
to
be
free?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
some
interest
too
on
the
part
of
the
state
in
not
taking
people
away
from
gainful
employment
in
order
to
serve
as
jurors
if
they
can
get
by
with
less?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
a
mathematical
proposition,
a
hung
jury
can
be
a
benefit
to
a
defendant
on
a
five
to
one
basis
just
to
sure
--
four
or
two
basis
just
to
surely
as
it
can
be
to
the
prosecution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
louisiana
constitution
and
code
of
criminal
procedure
provide
that
nonpetty
criminal
cases
shall
be
tried
before
a
jury
of
six-persons,
five
of
whom
must
concur
to
render
a
verdict.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
particular
case
to
decide
whether
conviction
by
a
nonunanimous
six-person
jury
in
a
state
criminal
trial
for
a
nonpetty
offense,
as
contemplated
by
provisions
of
the
louisiana
law
violates
the
right
of
an
accused
to
trial
by
jury
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
facts
are
quite
simple.
petitioners,
burch
and
wrestle,
inc.,
a
corporation
were
jointly
tried
before
a
six-person
jury
on
obscenity
charges.
both
were
found
guilty
and
a
poll
of
the
jury
after
verdict
indicated
that
the
jury
had
voted
unanimously
to
convict
wrestle,
inc.
and
had
voted
5-to-1
to
convict
burch.
on
appeal,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
affirmed
petitioner’s
convictions
holding
that
conviction
by
a
nonunanimous
six-person
jury
does
not
offend
the
constitution.
we
hold
first
in
our
opinion
that
wrestle,
inc.
lack
standing
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
provisions
of
louisiana
law
that
allow
a
conviction
by
a
nonunanimous
six-person
jury
because
it
was
in
fact
convicted
by
a
unanimous
six-member
jury.
and
since
we
held
just
last
term
in
ballew
against
georgia,
the
conviction
by
a
six-member
jury
is
constitutional.
we
affirm
the
conviction
of
wrestle,
inc.
while
the
question
as
to
burch
is
a
close
one,
we
further
hold
that
burch
who
was
convicted
by
the
nonunanimous
six-person
jury
was
deprived
of
his
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
a
jury.we
therefore
reverse
his
conviction.
our
cases
have
held
that
the
constitution
permits
juries
of
less
than
12
members
but
that
it
requires
at
least
six.
and
we
have
approved
the
use
of
certain
nonunanimous
verdicts
in
cases
involving
12
member
juries.
this
case
lies
at
the
intersection
of
our
cases
on
jury
size
and
on
unanimity.
we
don’t
pretend
to
see
a
bright
line
below
which
the
number
of
jurors
participating
in
the
trial
or
verdict
would
not
permit
the
jury
to
function
the
manner
required
by
our
prior
cases
but
it
is
inevitable
that
lines
must
be
drawn
somewhere
if
the
substance
of
the
jury
trial
right
is
to
be
preserved.
we
believe
that
conviction
by
unanimous
six-person
juries
sufficiently
threatens
the
substance
of
the
jury
trial
rights
so
as
to
violate
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution.
and
we
therefore
reverse
burch’s
conviction.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
