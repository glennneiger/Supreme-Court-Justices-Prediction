mr.
jack
peebles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
hereby
way
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
question
involved
is
whether
the
louisiana
constitutional
provision
for
trial
by
a
jury
of
six
persons
in
certain
criminal
cases
with
five
required
to
deliver
a
verdict
meets
our
offense,
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution.
in
the
louisiana
constitution
of
1974
which
is
now
in
service,
we
have
three
categories
for
our
criminal
juries.
in
capital
cases,
12
out
of
12
are
required
for
conviction.
in
cases
requiring
hard
labor,
10
out
of
12
were
required
for
conviction
and
in
lesser
felony
such
as
the
one
in
this
case
where
the
judge
may
impose
hard
labor
but
that
does
not
necessarily
have
to.
you
have
a
jury
provision
of
six
persons,
five
of
whom
must
concur
in
any
verdict.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
in
this
case
the
defendant,
daniel
burch
and
russel
incorporated,
the
corporation
involved,
were
each
convicted
on
two
counts
of
obscenity
under
the
state
of
sanity
statute.
specifically
they
were
alleged
to
have
shown
obscene
movies
in
a
coin-operated
machine
in
downtown
new
orleans.
there
were
two
charges,
two
convictions
and
burch
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
two
seven
month
terms
of
imprisonment
which
were
suspended.
he
was
fined
a
thousand
dollars.
the
corporation
received
a
six
hundred
dollar
fine
on
each
count.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
submitting
that
their
case
should
be
considered
along
with
burch's.
mr.
jack
peebles
the
only
rationale
we
can
present
to
the
court
as
to
why
they
--
their
case
should
be
considered
is
that
they
were
tried
under
the
same
statute.
by
way
of
analogy,
we
would
submit
the
duncan
versus
louisiana
shows
an
analogous
situation.
there
if
the
court
will
recall,
this
court
determined
that
for
the
first
time
that
a
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
jury
in
a
serious
criminal
case.
in
duncan's
case,
the
maximum
sentence
could've
been
imposed
under
the
statute
was
two
years.
in
fact,
duncan
was
only
sentenced
to
60
days
and
had
argument
the
--
mr.
jack
peebles
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
correct.
and
i'm
saying
it
by
analogy
as
in
duncan,
the
case
of
duncan
there
the
state
of
louisiana
argued
that
since
duncan
in
fact
received
the
sentence
which
was
not
in
legal
terminology
of
serious
sentence,
he
should
not
be
permitted
to
argue
his
case.
nonetheless
the
court
did
reach
the
merits
on
that
case.
that's
the
only
analogy
that
i
can
think
of
which
would
support
this
court's
entertaining
the
argument
of
russel
incorporated
here.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
--
i
don't
know
that
the
decision
would
have
to
be
retroactive
but
i
think
they
could've
raised
that
point
under
that
argument,
yes
your
honor.
however
there's
no
question
but
that
burch
who
was
convicted
by
a
five
to
one
vote
is
properly
here
whether
or
not
russel
should
be
considered
by
this
court.
our
argument
is
essentially
that
the
combination
of
the
non-unanimity
and
the
reduced
panel
--
offense,
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
this
court
has
said
in
williams
versus
florida
that
six
out
of
six
is
constitutional,
to
that
--
1970
and
in
ballew
versus
georgia
you
said
the
five
out
five,
offense,
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now
here
we
have
a
case
where
you
have
five
out
of
six
and
the
court
must
decide
whether
that
model
offense,
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
in
many
of
the
arguments
that
we
might
use
would
apply
to
the
ballew
decision,
five
out
of
five
and
many
of
the
arguments
that
the
state
might
make
might
apply
with
equal
vigor
to
the
williams
versus
florida
decision
regarding
six
out
of
six.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
court
has
decided
that
issue
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
in
this
case
your
honor
the
--
its
constitution
--
mr.
jack
peebles
you
still
have
six
people
voting
to
convict
that
are
to
acquit,
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
that's
not
required
by
the
statute
--
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
here
you
have
both
aspects,
the
non-unanimous
character
of
the
louisiana
statute
and
the
fact
that
only
six
are
required
to
constitute
the
jury
with
only
five
required
mr.
jack
peebles
no,
no,
i
--
if
--
that
was
foreclosed
by
williams
versus
florida.
mr.
jack
peebles
so
this
court
has
said
that
the
six-man
jury
with
a
unanimous
verdict
--
mr.
jack
peebles
--
is
constitutional,
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
peebles
no,
sir.
in
williams
however
the
court
did
indicate
that
it
preferred
the
unanimity
factor
and
in
the
court
statement
at
that
time
in
the
opinion
you
said
that
you
did
not
feel
that
there
were
any
major
reasons
why
the
six-man
jury
would
not
be
constitutional
as
contrasted
with
the
12
man
jury
particularly
if
their
--
the
jury
was
required
to
come
back
with
a
unanimous
vote.
but
of
course
we
do
not
have
a
unanimous
vote
here.
so,
the
questions
arises
if
you
don't
have
a
unanimous
vote
does
that
then
change
the
character
of
this
body
which
we
call
the
jury
so
that
the
essential
features
of
the
jury
and
its
classical
institutional
form
are
inhibited.
we
submit
that
it
does.
mr.
jack
peebles
the
--
mr.
jack
peebles
that
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
no,
your
honor.
i
was
referring
to
the
purposes
for
the
jury
that
the
court
has
perviously
indicated
requiring
adequate
deliberation,
a
cross-section
of
the
community,
that
sort
of
thing.
i
think
the
question
that
this
court
must
decide
is
whether
the
non-unanimous
six-man
in
jury
adequately
protects
those
features.
mr.
jack
peebles
there
was
your
honor.
and
so
that
--
mr.
jack
peebles
in
the
case,
less
deliberation
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
because
of
the
split
vote
well,
i
the
believed
that
some
of
the
sociological
studies
indicated
in
the
ballew
decision,
indicate
that
if
there
is
a
split
vote
so
that
only
a
majority
is
required
or
a
percentage
with
not
a
unanimous
vote
then
there
is
less
deliberation
insofar
as
time
is
concerned
then
there
ordinarily
would
be.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
our
argument
your
honor.
we
submit
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
peebles
not
in
--
we
do
not
know
what
happened
in
the
jury
room
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
we
are
â€“
we're
not
suggesting
any
hypotheses.
mr.
jack
peebles
well
--
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
of
course
your
honor,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
what
goes
on
in
a
jury
room
but
--
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
sir.
but
it
would
seem
logical
to
me
that
a
jury
which
requires
only
five
out
of
six
would
not
have
a
vigorous
debate
that
a
jury
would
have
--
if
all
six
members
were
required
to
bring
back
a
verdict.
i
think
some
--
now
with
the
sociological
studies
have
indicated
that
in
cases
where
a
non-unanimous
jury
was
the
one
in
question,
the
time
that
they
stayed
out
was
less.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
peebles
those
were
the
same
studies
your
honor.
our
position
here
is
that
you
have
said
in
ballew
that
five
men
are
not
adequate
to
represent
a
cross-section
of
the
community
and
to
give
adequate
deliberation
in
a
jury
room.
now
our
suggestion
--
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
if
all
along
--
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
sir.
and
our
position
here
is
that
i'm
merely
adding
another
individual
to
that
jury
who
does
not
--
whose
vote
is
not
required
in
order
to
bring
back
a
verdict.
you
have
not
essentially
change
the
nature
of
that
jury.
it
still
remains
essentially
a
ballew
jury.
and
in
some
respect
it's
even
worst.
one
of
the
points
made
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
the
ballew
decision
was
that
the
smaller
jury
resulted
in
less
hung
jury
which
ordinarily
inures
to
the
benefit
of
the
accused.
now
of
course
in
our
situation
where
you
have
five
out
of
six
as
contrasted
with
five
out
of
five,
you're
likely
to
have
even
fewer
hung
juries.
therefore
it's
even
more
to
the
detriment
of
the
defendant.
mr.
jack
peebles
how
many
would
we
need
in
order
to
have
another
--
the
cross-section?
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
it
would
be
--
i
would
be
the
perfect,
how
do
you
--
i
suppose
sir,
this
court
has
said
that
six
is
adequate
--
mr.
jack
peebles
--
in
williams
versus
florida.
mr.
jack
peebles
the
court
has
said
that
and
we
don't
call
with
opposition.
the
court
--
the
question
is,
is
that
the
absolute
minimum
required
so
that
no
change
can
be
made
which
would
reduce
the
potential
for
deliberation
and
cross-section
argument.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
jack
peebles
that
is
right.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
correct.
in
reducing
the
jury
to
six,
you
have
really
gotten
we
suggest
to
the
very
minimum
that
you
could
have
by
way
of
cross-section
as
--
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
ballew
decision
if
you
have
a
segment
of
10%
of
the
community
which
represents
a
particular
view
point
and
you
only
have
a
six-man
jury
then
statistically,
on
the
average
more
than
half
of
the
juries
you
select
will
not
have
any
representatives
of
that
ten
percent
view
point.
now,
the
court
has
held
that
six
out
of
six
is
constitutional.
but
as
you
add
to
that,
the
factor
that
not
all
six
votes
are
required
in
order
to
bring
back
a
verdict.
we
submit
that
if
then
there
is
any
legitimacy
to
the
argument
that
five
jurors
may
be
less
than
fully
impressed
with
the
argument
of
that
six
juror
then
you
have
gone
below
the
line
of
that
which
is
constitutional.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
would
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
some
of
the
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
courts
which
do
that,
their
--
maybe
the
case.
i'm
--
i
don't
think
there
are
any
other
courts
which
permit
it
in
criminal
cases
other
than
louisiana.
we
would
also
suggest
that
there
is
not
legitimate
state
interest
which
would
validate
their
reducing
the
number
of
jurors
required
to
convict
to
below
six.
as
the
court
has
said
in
the
ballew
decision,
if
such
an
interest
did
exist
and
of
course
there
would
be
maybe
argument
or
reason
for
permitting
these
five
out
of
six
model.
however,
the
only
results
here
that
might
be
of
--
might
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
state
would
be
the
reduced
time
required
for
jury
deliberations
and
the
reduced
number
of
hung
juries.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
reason
but
if
you're
--
we
are
suggesting
simply
that
that
type
of
reason
which
i
think
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
argument
i
suggested
that
they
would
reduce
a
deliberation
time,
same
kind
of
thing
is
simply
counterbalanced
by
the
fact
that
you
are
reducing
the
very
nature
of
the
jury.
beyond
that
which
people
commonly
conceive
to
be
a
jury
is
something
less
than
a
jury,
we
would
suggest.
mr.
jack
peebles
oh,
it
does
not.
i
have
understood
from
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
he
was
speaking
of
the
six-man
jury.
he
would
not
affect
the
situation
because
we
still
have
to
have
six
people
there
--
mr.
jack
peebles
--
no
matter
what
and
they
have
to
be
paid.
presumably,
they
would
not
hang
as
often
and
they
would
be
out
for
a
shortly
--
shorter
periods
of
time.
we
suggest
that
these
are
simply
not
sufficient
reasons
for
the
state
to
--
the
counterbalance
the
--
what
we
think
of
the
grave
problems
that
we
will
be
presenting
with
this
type
of
jury.
the
statistics
have
shown
that
--
and
is
indicated
in
footnote
10
of
ballew
that
with
the
12
man
of
jury
you
have
a
juries
that
hung
if
the
12
men
are
required
to
come
back
unanimously
about
five
percent
of
the
time.
if
you
reduce
that
same
panel
to
six
with
a
unanimous
return
you
have
about
half
of
that
number
of
juries
that
will
hang.
well
now,
if
you
still
--
then
go
further
and
eliminate
one
of
those
jurors
as
a
mandatory
vote.
i
would
suggest
that
you
have
practically
eliminated
the
hung
jury
in
our
system.
and
given
our
values
that
we
would
rather
see
ten
guilty
men
go
free
than
convict
one
innocent
man
i
would
suggest
that
the
hung
jury
has
its
place.
mr.
jack
peebles
that
--
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
that
regard
we
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
professor
--
as
i
saw,
i
believed
he
was
pointed
out
and
this
was
quoted
in
the
ballew
decision.
the
average
juror
has
a
propensity
to
convict
so
that
although
that's
mathematically
correct
it
would
not
probably
result
that
way.
most
juries
that
are
hung
or
hung
in
favor
--
most
votes
in
favor
of
conviction
but
with
one
or
two
holding
out
for
not
guilty,
i
believe
the
statistics
will
show
that.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
that
would
be
a
closer
question
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
not.
quite
frankly,
if
you
ask
my
impression,
my
impression
is
that
--
if
you
get
any
further
away
from
the
--
what
has
been
considered
the
classical
jury
system,
12
out
of
12.
you're
reducing
the
protection
below
the
constitutional
minimum.
and
i
would
say
that
anything
that
does
not
required
a
unanimous
jury
below
six
would
not
be
constitution.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
the
court
has
held
that
is
constitutional.
mr.
jack
peebles
but
you
have
more
total
numbers
there
of
the
jury.
if
i
may
address
myself
to
that
point
your
honor,
the
studies
have
shown
that
when
you
have
as
many
as
12
jurors
and
you
have
a
minority
of
two
or
three,
they're
most
--
more
likely
to
maintain
there
minority
view
point
in
the
course
of
deliberations.
then
you
are
if
you
have
a
very
small
jury
of
about
six
or
perhaps
only
one
as
a
minority
view.
he's
much
more
likely
to
be
to
--
as
a
result
of
the
conformity
pressures
on
him
to
give
up
his
views.
so
that
he
is
entirely
likely
that
although
nine
out
of
12
is
in
johnson
versus
louisiana
or
ten
out
of
12
is
in
apodaca
versus
oregon.
eleven
out
of
12?
well,
the
court
held
that
that's
legitimate
and
that's
constitutional.
but
you
have
enough
jurors
there
so
that
if
you
do
have
a
minority
of
two
or
three
they
can
still
work
together
and
hold
out
with
this
minority
view
point.
if
you
reduce
that
down
to
as
low
as
six
however,
then
--
and
you
only
have
one
minority
number,
we
submit
that
he
is
much
more
likely
to
give
in
and
thus
the
panel
loses.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
well
--
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
was
a
court
judgment,
yes.
so
there
were
number
of
opinions
in
that
court
and
i
recognize
the
fact
that
members
of
the
court
differ
over
the
approach
in
ballew.
i
thought
i
should
address
myself
to
it
because
it
certainly
was
there
and
as
your
honor
have
said,
if
you
don't
rely
to
some
extent
on
the
social
studies
then
you
come
close
to
just
using
judicial
hunch
and
if
you're
not
going
to
rely
on
history
as
--
or
at
least
if
you
conclude
that
history
is
not
going
to
give
us
a
final
answer
as
to
what
this
jury
--
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
help
that
the
court
would
review
the
question
of
the
history
of
the
jury
system
which
had
held
not
to
be
controlling
in
the
williams
decision
and
subsequently
in
apodaca.
amicus
brief,
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case
as
presented
even
further
evidence
with
regard
to
the
intent
of
the
primers
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
the
court
may
wish
to
consider.
i
do
not
think
that
a
review
of
that
question
is
mandatory
to
a
favorable
decision
for
the
petitioner
burch
in
this
case.
but
we
would
certainly
have
no
objection
to
the
court
considering
it.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
that
will
conclude
my
argument.
mr.
jack
peebles
thank
you.
mr.
jack
peebles
not
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
your
honor.
