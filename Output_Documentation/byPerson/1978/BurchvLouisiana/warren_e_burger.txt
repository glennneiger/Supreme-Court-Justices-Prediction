we'll
hear
argument
next
in
burch
against
louisiana.
mr.
peebles,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
classical
form,
traditional
form
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
12?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
12?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
sir.
they
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
not
suggest
that's
present
in
this
case
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you're
not
suggesting
any
hypothesis
about
that
processes
about
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
on
that
point
that
you
were
discussing
with
mr.
justice
white,
when
i
was
in
law
school
it
was
common
for
the
lecturer
to
say
that
divided
court
opinion
carries
more
weight
than
a
unanimous
opinion
of
a
multi
judge
court
whether
it
was
three
under
the
part
of
appeals
or
nine
here
because
that
showed
that
the
contest
--
the
issue
was
contested
right
--
to
the
end
of
the
line.
how
do
you
square
that
with
the
sociological
studies
i
suppose
--
that
each
of
them
has
about
the
same
value
perhaps.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
was
the
wisdom
of
lawyers
and
law
teachers
until
--
at
least
a
few
years
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
and
now
what
goes
on
in
the
conference
room
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
a
state
supreme
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
are
the
same
sociological
studies
that
said
a
jury
of
less
than
12
is
bad
because
it
reduced
the
chances
of
an
acquittal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
by
the
same
token,
a
jury
of
24,
36
or
48
would
cut
the
other
way,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
--
if
they're
all
alone
--
if
they
don't
have
a
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
number
of
six
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
relate
this
to
the
burden
of
proof
in
criminal
cases
as
distinguished
from
the
burden
of
proof
in
civil
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
most
of
the
states
permit
a
five
or
six
verdict
in
civil
cases,
do
they
are
not
after
--
sometimes
after
a
certain
lapse
of
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
korns.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
all
ballew
decided
was
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
total
number.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
korns,
you
missed
an
opportunity
to
point
out
that
this
court
allows
dissenting
opinions
and
dissenting
votes
but
we
count
them
anyway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
do
you
have
anything
mr.
peebles?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
burch
against
louisiana
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
