where
do
you
see
the
line
that
the
court
of
appeals
drew,
not
the
line
that
you
draw,
but
where
do
you
see
the
line?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
conduct
your
questioning
where
did
they
say
you
went
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
say
it
is
time
and
not
subject
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
abrams,
assume
this
went
to
trail,
you
couldn't
then
ask
him
whether
he
believed
it
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
at
the
trial,
you
say
that
you
believe
it
when
he
told
you
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
this
same
man
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
mike
wallace
is
on
the
witness
stand
and
if

particular
phase
in
your
did
you
believe
that
man
for
telling
the
truth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
i
am
talking
about
did
you
believe
him
when
he
told
you?
i
can't
get
this
line
between
the
two?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
example
i
know
what
the
answer
would
be
but
i
assume
you
say
that
he
couldn't
answer
the
question,
did
you
do
this
with
the
reckless
disregard?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
to
say
you
couldn't
ask
him
that
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn't
object
to
it
because
you
would
know
what
the
answer
would
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
abrams,
let's
get
a
way
--
away
from
this
case.
the
reporter
has
a
transcript
of
a
trial
in
california,
and
he
selects
out
of
it
portions
to
read
them
on
his
television
show.
could
you
ask
him
about
what
discussions
he
had
with
people
about
which
one
of
those
portions
he
should
read?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
and
he
picks
and
chooses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
does
that
with
discussion
with
other
people
in
his
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
do
you
get
the
chilling
there,
who
gets
chilled?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
gets
chilled?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
get
chilled,
reporters
get
chilled?
