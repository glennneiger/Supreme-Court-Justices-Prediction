justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
this
court
has
developed
that
--
you
mean
that
there
was
no
inquiry
on
the
other
arm
of
knowing
falsehood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
are
you
telling
us
that
he
did
answer
questions
directed
to
knowing
falsity
of
some
of
the
things
that
were
shown
on
the
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
can
you
illustrate,
for
example?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
illustrate
just
that?
do
you
have
one?
i
don't
want
to
take
all
your
time,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
speaking
now
of
mr.
lando?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
he
also
refused
to
answer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
lubell
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that
stage,
was
there
any
controversy
whether
some
of
the
matters
shown
on
the
"60-minutes"
program
was
or
was
not
false?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
stating
at
that
stage
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
issue
of
falsity
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
very
much
in
this
case,
still
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
still
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
there
ever
any
suggestion
that
the
issue
of
falsity
should
be
determined
before
you
get
into
the
question
of
malice
because
unless
something
was
false,
i
gather
you
wouldn't
have
a
case,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
on
the
issue
of
so-called
editorial
privilege
or
whatever
you're
going
to
call
this,
a
privilege,
i
take
it
that
wouldn't
even
be
in
the
case
unless
there
was
first
the
finding
of
falsity
of
something
about
this
program,
would
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it
immunized
in
the
sense
that
it
was
privileged
in
some
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
avoid
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
forgive
me,
i
shouldn't
have
taken
so
much
of
your
time
but
i
gather,
you
have
allegations,
i
take
it,
do
you
not,
on
which
you
rely
of
falsity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
are
they
very
--
about
many,
many
matters
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
a
few,
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
of
which,
as
you
say
falsehoods.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
depicted
in
the
60-minutes
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
interviewed
john
jones,
i
did.
what
did
he
tell
you?
he
told
me
so-and-so.
didn't
you
know
that
john
jones
have
said
not
that
but
this
to
somebody
else?
couldn't
you
ask
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
don't
have
any
court
opinion
anyway,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
no
court
opinion
from
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
which
opinions
are
you
talking
about
when
--
what
you're
about
to
say?
judge
kaufman's
or
judge
oakes'?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
can't
say
did
you
believe
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
certainly
you
have
no
problem
about
those
sources
here,
did
you
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
does
--
did
you
believe
him?
why
does
that
also
go
to
that
absolute
core?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
does
that
go
to
the
absolute
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but,
didn't
i
understand
you
to
answer
my
brother
white
that
did
you
believe
him
would
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
question
mr.
abrams
not
that
you
believed
him.
didn't
you
know
that
he
had
told
a
different
story
to
john
smith,
how
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
what
about
it,
is
that
within
or
outside
the
protective
code?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
abrams,
what
of
mr.
lubell's
comment
on
editorial
process,
all
of
that's
been
revealed
in
mr.
lando's
article
in
the
atlantic
monthly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
it
applies
to
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
haven't
seen
it.
is
it
in
the
record
here?
