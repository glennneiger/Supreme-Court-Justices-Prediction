chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
1105,
herbert
against
lando.
mr.
lubell
i
think
you
can
safely
proceed
now,
and
be
heard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
of
this
is
directed
at
what,
at
the
presence
or
absence
of
malice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
should
be
our
focus,
should
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
here
you
are
suggesting
that,
the
responses
where
force
coming
as
to
the
state
of
mind
when
it
helped
the
defendant's
case,
but
not
when
conceivably
it
might
harmed
the
defendant's
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lubell,
let
me
interrupt
you.
you
can
reflect
on
that
during
lunch
hour,
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lubell,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
majority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
assuming
now
mr.
lubell
the
question
suggested
by
justice
white
has
been
answered,
in
that
he
has
had
two
statements
made
to
that
are
not
consistent.
under
this
opinion
or
of
these
collective
opinions,
do
you
think
you
cannot
ask
why
did
you
publish
this
and
why
did
you
omit
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
miami
herald
bear
on
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
that
wasn't
involved
in
the
miami
herald
case
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
probably
beyond
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that's
an
unfair
strategy
in
war?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
this
if
the
statement
were
false
and
that
it
was
known
that
it
was
false,
then
it
might
be,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
mr.
abrams
is
that
under
in
new
york
times
and
sullivan
malice
is
a
state
of
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
the
question
then
in
the
cases
how
the
plaintiff
finds
that
out,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
they
find
out
what's
cbs?
knew
except
by
asking
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
concede
then
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
when
you
ask
the
cbs
representative
when
you
said
this,
did
you
know
'a,'
'a,'
'a?'
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you've
emphasized
--
you've
emphasized
objective,
mr.
abrams,
in
a
number
of
your
responses.
at
least
three
places
i
observe
in
the
sullivan
case,
the
court
refers
to
malice
as
a
state
of
mind
and
i
gathered
earlier
you
did
not
--
you
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
that
malice
is
a
state
of
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
probe
for
the
presence
or
absence
of
malice
if
you
can't
ask
what
was
the
state
of
mind
at
the
time
this
or
that
was
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
take
a
criminal
case
for
example,
and
the
defense
is
self-defense.
you
wouldn't
suggest,
would
you,
that
you
can't
ask
the
prosecutor,
once
the
defendant
has
taken
the
stand
asserting
self-defense,
that
he
can't
cross-examine
him
without
limit
on
his
state
of
mind
with
respect
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
the
state
of
mind
be
relevant
to
self-defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
or
course,
you
can't
prove
his
state
of
mind
if
he
isn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
a
civil
case,
you
can't
do
that,
can
you,
you
must
take
the
stand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
suggest
that
privilege
of
a
reporter
is
different
from
the
privilege
of
some
other
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
are
many
libel
cases
brought
against
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
journalism,
aren't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
now
let's
narrow
it
down
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
let's
narrow
it
down
to
two
different
kinds
of
defendants
in
libel
cases,
one
is
a
media
reporter
and
one
is
just
another
taxpayer
who
happened
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
just
make
some
very
bad
statements
about
someone,
not
a
writer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
another
citizen
who
is
not
--
doesn't
purport
to
be
a
professional
writer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
there
is
a
difference
in
the
scope
of
probing
the
mind
of
the
one
from
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
of
any
case,
none
in
this
court
of
course,
but
any
case
in
any
court
which
has
put
a
limit
on
the
cross-examination
of
the
witness
when
the
issue
is
malice,
whether
it's
a
murder
case
or
whatever
kind
of
case
it
may
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
true
in
civil
cases,
is
it
not
in
federal
tort
claims
cases
against
the
government,
one
of
the
classic
cases
in
this
court?
the
government
said
they
could
not
respond
about
all
the
gadgetry
and
things
that
were
in
the
experimental
plane
because
this
would
give
away
national
secrets.
and
so
the
courts
said,
if
you
can't
respond,
then
the
court
will
presume
the
worst
and
enter
judgment
against
the
government
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
or
course,
theoretically,
the
united
states
could
have
told
the
court
in
philadelphia
in
that
case
that,
no,
we
will
not
respond
because
this
is
a
national
security
matter,
which
is
about
what
it
did,
then
the
court
said,
if
you
don't
respond,
we'll
enter
judgment
against
you,
we'll
presume
the
worst.
that's
the
effect
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
just
one
more
question
about
your
reference
to
discussions
within
the
publisher's
establishment.
i
was
just
focusing
on
the
language
of
the
opinion
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
and
let
me
read
it
to
you.
finally,
there
is
evidence
that
the
times
published
without
checking
its
accuracy
against
the
news
stories
in
the
times
own
files,
you
remember
that
was
an
ad,
not
a
news
story.
the
mere
presence
of
the
stories
in
the
files
does
not,
of
course,
establish
that
the
times
knew
and
the
court
put
that
word
in
quotation,
"knew"
that
the
advertisement
was
false,
since
the
state
of
mind
required
for
actual
malice
would
have
to
be
brought
home
to
the
persons
in
the
times
organization,
having
responsibility
for
the
publication.
now
how
would
you
get
at
that
if
you
couldn't
ask
these
people
what
was
in
their
minds
at
the
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
editor,
to
ask
him
what
was
in
the
files?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
get
a
hint
from
some
of
the
things,
at
least
between
the
lines
of
your
argument
mr.
abrams,
that
perhaps
some
misreading
of
the
opinions
has
taken
place.
is
that
a
reasonable
conjecture
on
my
part?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
opinions
of
the
second
circuit,
that
some
people
may
be
misreading
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
few
minutes
left,
mr.
lubell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
1105,
herbert
against
lando
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
white.
