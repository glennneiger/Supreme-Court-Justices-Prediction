justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
lubell?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
any
questions
that
started
out,
did
you
know
would
be
barred
by
this
ruling?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
know
a
particular
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
couldn't
inquire
whether
a
particular
fact
was
true
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
find
out
what
he
was
told?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
ask
--
justice
byron
r.
white
couldn't
you
ask
--
couldn't
you
ask
did
you
ever
learned
that
so
and
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
--
you
really
read
it
to
me
that
you
cannot
inquire
from
the
reporter
the
state
of
his
knowledge,
that
whether
he
knew
a
certain
facts
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
couldn't
say,
were
you
ever
told
by
anybody
else
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
couldn't
you
go
on
and
say,
did
you
ever
learn
from
any
other
source
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
that
imply
that
you
can
ask
anything
--
ask
him
whether
he
knew
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
if
either
--
if
there
are
only
two
people
supporting
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
either
one
of
them
says
that
something
is
discoverable,
it's
discoverable
under
that
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
ask
--
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
fair
implication
from
what
you
read
a
moment
ago
that
you
could
say
when
you
went
into
this
process,
did
you
know
it
and
when
you
came
out
of
the
process,
did
you
know
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
he
came
out
of
it
knowing
it,
he
learned
it
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
ask
him
a
particular
question,
did
you
know
so-and-so?
or,
did
you
not
know
so-and-so?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
else
do
you
prove
a
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
that
the
--
then
in
this
judgment
you
could
not
ask
where
you
ever
told
something
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
somebody
on
the
within
the
editorial
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
were
told
him
by
some
outsider,
you
could
inquire
into
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
ask
whether
he
thought
it
was
true
or
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
can't
ask
whether
he
thought
some
witness
was
truthful
or
not
whether
he
was
telling
a
falsehood
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
from
that
what
judge
kaufman
said
that
he
wasn't
indicating
that
the
plaintiff
would
be
limited
in
finding
out
what
information
the
newspaper
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
except
perhaps
what
the
individual
reporter
may
have
learned
during
the
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
terms
of
out
â€“
of
what
information
he
had
from
outside
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
learn
or
what
did
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
saying
he
shouldn't
be
asked,
he
shouldn't
be
required
to
answer,
did
you
know
he
was
a
liar?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
he
was
telling
the
falsehood
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
objected
to
a
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
at
the
time
you
had
this
interview
with
this
particular
source,
did
you
believe
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
too
involved
some
sort
of
cognition?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
you
i
gather
you
would
think
that
he
could
be
asked,
were
you
told
us
something
to
the
contrary
by
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
would
be
say
--
and
you
did
not
put
this
on
the
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
any
kind
where
an
intent,
where
any
kind
of
a
fraud
case,
civil
fraud
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
10(b)(5)
case,
now,
how
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
state
of
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
while
i've
got
you
interrupted,
i
take
it
that
your
submission
here
is
not
just
that
the
state
of
--
that
there
should
be
no
inquiry
into
state
of
mind,
but
there
shouldn't
be
any
inquiry
into
the
editorial
process,
the
decision-making
process,
and
for
example,
you
would
say
that
it
would
be
an
improper
question
to
say,
what
did
another
one
of
your
editors
tell
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
what
did
you
tell
one
of
your
senior
editors?
any
conversations
in
that
process?
it's
sort
of
similar
to
sort
of
an
executive
privilege
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
sometimes
what
happens
with
the
government
when
they
claim
the
privilege
is
what
the
government's
interest
--
if
they
want
to
claim
the
privilege,
they
must
give
up
the
interest.
in
a
criminal
case,
for
example
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
claim
--
they
want
to
claim
a
privilege,
i
mean
they
have
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
and
if
the
government
wants
to
pursue
someone
civilly
and
still
claim
a
privilege
for
some
information
they
have,
they
may
not
be
able
to
press
their
claim
very
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
this
never
happened
under
the
old
libel
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
conversations
whatsoever
in
the
editorial
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
conversations
in
the
editorial
process
may
not
be
inquired
into?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
considerably
different
kettle
of
fish
than
just
talking
about
state
of
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
involves
a
defamation
action
which
began
when
petitioner,
anthony
herbert,
sued
columbia
broadcasting
system
and
two
principal
participants
in
the
cbs
network
broadcast
containing
various
statements
about
herbert
that
allegedly
were
false
and
damaging
to
his
reputation.
because
herbert
was
a
public
figure
as
that
term
is
understood
in
the
law
of
libel
and
slander,
his
burden
was
to
prove
not
only
false
and
damaging
publication
but
one
that
the
defendants'
knew
or
should
have
known
was
false.
during
discovery
and
in
the
course
of
taking
the
deposition
of
barry
lando,
the
producer
of
the
program,
herbert's
attorney
made
various
inquiries
into
lando's
thoughts,
opinions,
and
conclusions
about
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
material
gathered
by
him
as
well
as
inquiries
about
his
conversations
with
his
editorial
colleagues.
lando
declined
to
answer
both
categories
of
questions
claiming
that
the
first
amendment
privileged
him
to
do
so.
the
district
court
disagreed
and
directed
that
the
questions
be
answered.
this
interlocutory
ruling
was
certified
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
a
divided
panel
of
that
court
reversed
holding
that
the
first
amendment
relieved
lando
from
any
obligation
to
answer
the
questions
at
issue
even
though
the
answers
might
produce
important
evidence
relevant
to
the
proof
of
herbert's
case.
we
granted
herbert's
petition
for
certiorari
and
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
an
opinion
in
which
six
of
us
concur,
we
explain
that
the
first
amendment
has
not
heretofore
been
construed
to
protect
defendants
in
libel
suits
from
answering
questions
about
their
knowledge
or
beliefs
concerning
the
truthfulness
of
their
material
or
about
their
motives
for
publishing
it.
indeed,
it
has
been
common
place
and
essential
in
libel
and
slander
suits
where
conditional
privileges
or
punitive
damages
have
been
claimed
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
mind
of
the
publisher.
it
has
never
been
thought
that
the
federal
constitution
was
an
obstacle
to
the
introduction
of
such
evidence
and
our
most
recent
relevant
cases
have
reflected
this
same
understanding.
because
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
the
plaintiff's
burden
in
this
case
was
to
prove
a
knowing
or
reckless
falsehood
and
we
do
not
agree
that
the
amendment
should
also
prevent
the
plaintiff
from
seeking
direct
evidence
from
the
defendants
about
a
critical
part
of
his
case.
we
leave
the
first
amendment
as
it
is
and
decline
to
construe
it
to
create
the
absolute
privilege
for
the
categories
of
evidence
involved
in
this
case.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
reversed.
mr.
justice
powell
while
joining
the
court's
opinion
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in
part.
he
agrees
with
the
majority
that
lando
was
not
privileged
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
about
his
own
beliefs
as
to
the
truth
of
the
material
he
gathered.
but
mr.
justice
brennan
would
protect
against
inquiry
into
editorial
conversation
until
there
has
been
a
prima
facie
showing
of
falsehood
as
a
publication.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
