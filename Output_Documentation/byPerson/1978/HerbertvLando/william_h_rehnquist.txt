justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
you
say
their
state
of
mind
as
to
matters?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
be
a
little
more
precise
for
what
issue
were
you
directing
would
those
answers
have
been
relevant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lubell,
in
an
ordinary
lawsuit,
in
the
discovery
stage
of
the
case,
you
have
to
do
your
discovery
for
all
of
the
issues
that
you
think
will
be
necessary
to
prove
at
trial
before
you
ever
get
to
trial,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
in
a
deposition
that,
that
sort
of
thing
had
happened?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
question
of
new
york
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
question
of
new
york
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
question?
what
did
you
believe
as
the
mr.
justice
brennan
said
when
you
were
told
that,
what
was
your
reaction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
a
real
problem
for
plaintiffs
in
cases
like
this
that's
having
in
my
own
practice
been
a
party
on
both
sides
to
fraud
cases
and
defamation
cases,
you
don't
get
admissions
out
of
defendants
mouths
that
they
lied,
you
have
to
go
after
them
in
tangential
ways?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case
of
the
new
york
times
against
sullivan
what
justice
marshall
was
asking,
isn't
it?
one
of
the
ultimate
facts
that
a
jury
has
to
determine
is
whether
he
did
that
with
reckless
disregard
to
the
two?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
have
thought
--
moved
over
--
you
said
a
question
about
belief
in
the
truth
of
something
could
not
be
asked?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
amounts
as
though
the
soft
pitches
you
can
hit
and
the
hard
ones
you
can
duck?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
but
in
--
but
the
kind
of
questions
that
you
say
are
not
answerable
and
to
go
further
in
the
process,
certainly
no
producers
is
going
to
say,
i
didn't
believe
what
i
put
on
the
program,
but
if
you
go
further
back
in
the
process
and
say
what
did
you
think
after
you
learned
that
'x'
said
such
and
such,
you
may
get
a
string
of
answers
that
may
permit
a
jury
to
infer
that
he
didn't
believe
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
before
1965,
it
happened
all
the
time,
before
new
york
times
against
sullivan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
for
punitive
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
actual
malice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
at
the
very
beginning,
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion
says,
appeal
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
1292(b)?
