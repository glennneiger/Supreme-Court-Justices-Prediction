mr.
lubell,
could
you
give
us
perhaps
the
most
persuasive
example
you
can
think
of,
of
a
question
that
you
asked
and
that
he
refused
to
answer?
one
of
the
things
i
have
trouble
with
in
this
case
is,
it's
awfully
general.
justice
john
paul
stevens
specifically,
you
question
in
--
is
this
a
fair
paraphrase?
why
did
you
not
include
any
reference
to
such
and
such
an
interview
and
he
refused
to
answer
any
such
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
question
he
refused
to
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
abrams,
before
you
sit
down,
when
you
started,
you
called
my
attention
to
page
53
(a)
of
the
appendix.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
you
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
be
interested
in
your
response.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
think
that
the
question
would
be
proper
if
it
were
asked
this
way,
in
the
light
of
what
these
other
four
persons
had
to
say,
did
you
have
any
doubt
about
the
credibility
of
mr.
potter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
he
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
was
mr.
potter
telling
the
truth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
this
wasn't
on
the
program
but
it
was
just
one
that
was
slightly
different.
well,
you'd
say
that
could
be
not
inquired.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
one
involved
editorial
process
any
more
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
process
wasn't
broadcast
--
the
product
of
the
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
permissible
to
ask
why
he
put
potter's
statement
on,
but
it
is
not
permissible
to
ask,
why
did
you
not
put
the
other
four
statements
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
there
were
a
second
statement
by
mr.
potter,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
am
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
statement
by
mr.
potter
was
somewhat
similar,
but
was
not
actually
put
on
the
air.
it
would
not
be
permissible
to
say,
did
you
believe
that
statement
by
mr.
potter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lubell,
let
me
ask
you
just
one
question.
at
the
end
of
judge
oakes'
opinion,
his
last
sentence,
it
refers
to
that
he
concurs
in
the
general
answer
of
chief
judge
kaufman
to
the
certified
question.
was
there
a
single
question
certified
to
the
court?
that's
on
page
46(a)
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
a
single
--
where
is
it
in
the
papers
that
have
been
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
certificate
of
the
district
judge
would
be
under
1292(b)
saying
an
interlocutory
appeal
is
ordered,
is
that
what
he's
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
