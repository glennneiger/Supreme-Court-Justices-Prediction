mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
reversing
a
discovery
order
of
the
district
court
and
establishing
an
absolute
privilege
of
non
disclosure
of
the
editorial
process.
this
is
a
sullivan
defamation
case.
it
arises
from
a
cbs
60
minutes
program,
produced
by
barry
lando
and
mike
wallace.
in
that
program,
the
plaintiff
colonel
herbert,
was
portrayed
as
a
liar,
as
one
capable
of
committing
acts
of
brutality
in
vietnam,
as
an
opportunist
who
had
used
the
war
crimes
charge
to
cover
up
his
own
relief
from
command
and
is
a
perpetrator
of
a
hoax
on
the
american
public.
plaintiff
after
the
broadcast,
brought
the
libel
action
which
is
now
before
this
court.
during
the
course
of
pre-trial,
plaintiff
sought
to
discover
what
the
defendants
had
done
and
learned
in
the
course
of
their
investigation
preparing
for
the
program,
and
what
the
defendant's
state
of
mind
was
on
the
matters
which
they
had
investigated
and
learned
about
during
that
investigation.
questions
were
posed
within
that
context
to
mr.
lando
and
mr.
wallace,
as
to
what
their
state
of
mind
was,
as
to
matters
actually
presented
on
the
program,
as
well
as
matters
not
presented
on
the
program,
and
contradictory
to
the
matters
presented
on
the
program.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes.
the
issue
--
the
legal
issue
we
were
directed
to
was
the
issue
of
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant's,
whether
there
in
fact
they
entertained
that
serious
doubts
as
to
the
truth
of
matters
presented
on
the
program.
specifically
it
evolves
in
various
contexts.
for
example,
during
the
deposition
of
mr.
lando,
we
ascertained
that
he
had
interviewed,
in
one
example,
a
group
of
five
different
soldiers
and
who
had
served
with
colonel
herbert
in
vietnam.
four
of
those
soldiers
told
him
certain
things
about
colonel
herbert's
treatment
in
regard
for
the
vietnamese
population.
a
fifth
soldier
told
him
a
contrary
story.
mr.
lando
presented
on
the
program
only
the
statement
of
the
fifth
soldier,
and
failed
to
include
on
the
program
any
reference
to
the
statements
of
the
four
other
soldiers
which
indicated
the
care
and
concern
that
colonel
herbert
had
shown
while
he
served
in
vietnam.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
within
the
absence
of
actual
--
presence
or
absence
of
actual
malice
within
the
reckless
disregard
branch
of
that
actual
malice
definition.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
we
had
--
the
knowing
falsehood
issues,
we
have
asked
questions
of
mr.
lando
regarding
knowledge
of
certain
things
which
were
directly
contrary
to
matters
presented
on
the
program,
which
indicate
a
knowledge
of
the
falsehood
of
certain
malice.
in
fact
mr.
lando
has
answered
those
questions.
the
concrete
posture
of
the
questions
which
have
not
been
answered
is
all
of
those
questions
appear
to
involve
the
reckless
disregard
branch,
although
our
same
argument
would
apply
to
his
state
of
mind
on
the
knowledge
of
the
falsity.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
he
answered
questions.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
he
answered
questions
for
example,
during
the
--
on
the
program
mike
wallace
stated
that
nobody
that
they
interviewed
could
told
them
that
colonel
herbert
had
reported
any
of
the
war
crimes
while
in
vietnam.
he
produced
during
the
depositions,
sworn
statements
of
a
captain
jack
donovan,
which
stated
that
captain
donovan
was
present
at
brigade
headquarters
when
colonel
herbert
was
reporting
the
killings
of
the
vietnamese
at
cu
loi
on
february
14,
1969.
he
produced
those
documents.
we
asked
him
questions
about
those
documents.
we
did
not
specifically
ask
the
question,
did
he
know
that
what
was
stated
on
the
program
was
false?
so
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
as
such.
in
terms
of
questions
that
he
did
answer
during
the
deposition,
mr.
lando
as
well
as
mr.
wallace
did
answer
a
number
of
questions
involving
their
state
of
mind.
in
addition,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
case
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
yes.
for
example,
as
to
the
question
--
as
to
the
questions
of
whether
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
in
his
--
in
what
he
had
obtained
from
interviews
between
a
colonel
and
a
major
who
were
in
hawaii
early
in
february
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
mr.
lando
--
in
terms
of
he
had
interviewed
a
colonel
nicholson
and
a
major
who
had
been
in
--
a
major
crouch
--
who
had
been
in
hawaii.
and
one
of
the
questions
that
was
involved
is,
when
did
franklin
return
from
hawaii
to
vietnam?
questions
were
asked
in
his
interviews
of
these
two
people
about
--
when
mrs.
franklin
had
left
hawaii.
i
asked
mr.
lando
whether
he
thought
there
was
a
conflict
or
contradiction
between
the
information
he
got
from
these
two
interviewees.
he
said
that
he
thought
that
their
statements
regarding
mrs.
franklin's
leaving
hawaii
were
contradictory.
so
he
did
give
us
certain
answers
regarding
his
state
of
mind.
there
is
no
consistency
as
to
which
answers
he
didn't
give
regarding
his
state
of
mind
and
which
he
did
not.
perhaps
the
only
consistency
is
that,
as
the
deposition
proceeded,
mr.
lando's
counsel
and
counsel
for
cbs
decided
to
take
a
firm
position
that
they
would
answer
no
questions
regarding
state
of
mind.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
yes.
the
questions,
for
example
--
the
example
that
i
posed
before,
he
had
interviewed
a
number
of
soldiers
who
had
given
him
detailed
information
as
to
colonel
herbert's
treatment
of
the
vietnamese.
he
puts
none
of
that
information
on
the
program.
he
does
not
refer
to
the
fact
that
there
was
information
that
land
--
that
colonel
herbert
had
shown
particular
care
that
war
crimes
not
be
committed
in
vietnam.
we
asked
him
questions
as
to
the
basis
upon
which
he
did
not
include
any
reference
to
those
interviews
in
his
program,
and
nevertheless
included
a
quote
from
general
barnes
that
colonel
herbert
was
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
what
was
the
--
actually,
we
didn't
say
why
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
we
said,
what
was
the
basis
for
not
including
the
--
any
excerpts
from
those
interviews?
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes.
in
addition,
we
asked
him
for
his
opinions
of
the
creditability
and
veracity
of
persons
whose
statements
he
did
include
on
the
program.
we
think
that
was
directly
relevant
to
whether
he
entertained
serious
doubts
as
to
matters
included
on
the
program.
we
think
that
is
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
those
he
refused
to
answer
too,
your
honor.
now,
when
the
defendants
lando
and
wallace
refused
to
answer
questions
in
these
areas
of
state
of
mind,
plaintiff
made
a
rule
37
motion,
which
was
brought
before
judge
haight,
the
district
court
judge.
judge
haight
considered
the
sullivan
principles
and
specifically
considered
the
burden
of
proof
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
which
applies
in
the
sullivan
case,
considered
the
subjective
nature
of
the
state
of
mind
that
must
be
proven,
found
that
the
questions
which
he
had
--
which
lando
in
particular
and
wallace
to
some
extent,
because
there
were
very
few
questions
open
around
mike
wallace,
that
the
questions
that
they
had
refused
to
answer
were
directly
relevant
to
the
subjective
state-of-mind
issue,
that
the
issue
of
the
subjective
state
of
mind
was
a
core
issue
in
the
case,
and
that
the
information
as
to
the
defendants'
state
of
mind
could
only
be
obtained
from
the
defendants
by
the
very
nature
of
the
subject
matter.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
the
defendants
take
the
position
that
the
matters
presented
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
at
that
stage,
no.
the
issue
--
at
that
stage
before
the
district
court
judge,
the
issue
was
whether
the
questions
were
privileged
in
terms
it
oppresses
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
falsity
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
the
issue
of
falsity
is
in
the
case,
very
much
in
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
i
don't
think
the
defendants
have
conceded
that
the
statements
made
on
the
program
are
false.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
right,
there
was
no
suggestion.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
discovery
process
has
proceeded
in
uncovering,
trying
to
uncover
both
issues
simultaneously.
and
i'm
sure
as
your
honors
appreciate
both
issues
are
intertwined
because
as
we
learned
the
facts,
we
also
learn
what
it
was
that
cbs
ascertained.
so
we
also
learn
what
cbs
is
--
also
learn
some
evidence
of
cbs'
state
of
mind
as
we
learned
the
facts,
in
order
to
prove
that
the
program
contained
serious
falsehoods.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
is
so
because
what
the
circuit
court
did
is
take
this
entire
range
of
media
activity,
which
they
call
the
editorial
process,
and
immunized
it
from
discovery
by
a
plaintiff.
now,
it
is
possible
that
in
our
search
for
the
facts
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
in
the
sense
that
it
was
privilege,
we
could
not
obtain
what
happened
during
that
editorial
process
and
i
suggest
that
it
is
possible
that
during
that
editorial
process,
certain
things
may
have
a
vision
which
relate
to
the
question
of
truth
and
falsity
as
well.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes.
yes,
your
honor
and
that
is
the
way
we
proceeded
in
this
lawsuit
that
we
have
asked
questions
of
lando
and
wallace
and
the
other
persons
we've
deposed,
directed
to
the
issues
of
truth
and
falsity,
to
the
issue
of
actual
malice,
both
issues.
and
i
don't
--
i
might
suggest,
i
don't
see
in
this
type
of
case
how
it
is
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
--
as
a
practical
matter
ever
able
to
be
distinguished.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
judge
haight's
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
oh,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
they
are.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
we
maintain
that
the
program
as
a
whole
as
well
as
many
specific
matters
presented
in
the
program
are
false.
and
as
i
indicated
in
the
in
my
opening
comments,
that
the
falsity
concerns
whether
herbert
was
a
liar,
as
to
the
cover
up
of
war
crimes
in
the
173rd
airborne
brigade,
whether
herbert
himself
was
capable
of
committing
acts
of
brutality
against
the
vietnamese,
whether
herbert
had
used
the
war
crime
issue
as
an
excuse
for
his
own
relief
from
command,
and
whether
herbert
had
perpetrated
a
hoax
upon
the
american
people.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
all
of
which
are
falsehood.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes.
yes,
we
say
they
are.
yes,
your
honor.
i
wanted
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
the
defendants
discussing
or
disclosing
parts
of
their
state
of
mind.
there
is
another
fact
in
this
case,
which
makes
it
unique
in
another
way
and
that
is,
after
the
program,
barry
lando
wrote
an
article
for
atlantic
monthly.
it
is
the
other
cause
of
action
in
this
case
which
is
not
before
this
court.
however,
the
article
itself
is
a
full
discussion
of
what
was
the
purported
editorial
process
in
producing
the
program.
not
only
that,
but
the
article
time
and
time
again,
speaks
of
mr.
lando's
state
of
mind
on
matters
that
he
was
looking
at
while
he
was
preparing
the
program.
so
we
have
a
situation
where
the
press
has
publicly
gotten
a
shot
at
saying
what
its
state
of
mind
is
and
now
would
prevent
a
plaintiff
from
examining
the
press
in
a
lawsuit
in
which
a
district
court
judge
can
regulate
whether
there's
any
abuse
of
discovery,
from
examining
the
press
as
to
that
state
of
mind
which
is
critical
in
a
sullivan
defamation
action.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
we
are
suggesting
that.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i
don't
believe
so.[attempt
to
laughter]
now
the
heart
of
our
argument
before
this
court
is
that
by
--
the
court
of
appeals,
by
creating
this
editorial
process
privilege
has
upset
the
balance
struck
by
this
court
in
sullivan
and
it's
progeny
because
what
and
succinctly
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
is
deprived
the
plaintiff
of
the
opportunity
of
ascertaining
direct
evidence
of
this
subjective
state
of
mind
in
case,
where
the
plaintiff
has
to
satisfy
a
clear
and
convincing
burden
of
proof.
in
substance
what
the
second
circuit
has
done
is
by
a
rule
which
creates
that
privilege
eliminated
substantially
all
plaintiff's
possibilities
that
we're
recovering
under
insolvent
principles.
and
we
submit
that
it
was
not
the
purpose
of
this
court
in
sullivan
and
it's
progeny
to
preclude
public
officials
or
public
figures
from
recovering
for
defamatory
statements,
when
those
statements
will
maliciously
made.
the
court
of
appeals
relies
in
part
upon
this
court's
decision
in
branzburg
as
well
as
the
line
of
cases
concerning
confidential
source
disclosure.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
error,
when
it
relies
upon
on
branzburg
and
the
confidential
source
disclosure
cases.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
branzburg
has
provoked
a
great
deal
of
discussion
both
from
lower
courts
and
in
learning
journals.
but
there
is
one
thing
that
is
undisputed,
branzburg
did
not
create
an
absolute
privilege.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
other
hand
creates
an
absolute
privilege.
in
addition,
the
plurality
in
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
that
the
court
of
appeals
drew?
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i
think
that,
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
the
--
i
think
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
i
think
they
would
say
any
inquiry
into
what
the
media
or
the
press
did
after
obtaining
the
interview
from
that
time,
until
the
time
that
the
finished
product
is
broadcast
we
could
not
inquire
into.
we
could
not
find
out
whether
in
fact
during
that
time
for
example
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
it
will
receive
as
both
a
period
of
--
i
think
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
which
one
is
the
more
powerful
aspect.
we
submit
both
are
powerful
in
terms
of
upsetting
solvent
completely,
but
one
is
you
cannot
inquire
into
the
subjective
state
of
mind,
which
is
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
yes
we
believe.
we
believe
that
would
pertain
to
the
state
of
mind
of
the
reporter.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
we
could
inquire
as
to
who
he
interviewed.
we
could
not
inquire
as
to
whether
he
knew
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
what
he
was
told,
but
we
couldn't
inquire
for
example,
as
to
whether
he
knew
the
person
he
was
interviewing
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i
am
sorry.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i
believe
that
when
chief
judge
kaufman
talked
about
any
intrusion
into
the
mental
process
of
the
press,
i
believe
that
he
speaks
of
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
we
can
inquire
as
to
--
i
believe
we
can
inquire
as
to
what
he
did,
but
i
do
not
believe
we
can
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
it
is
my
opinion
that
chief
judge
kaufman's
opinion
is
not
clear
as
to
whether
that
question
is
permissible
when
he
states
that
any
intrusion
into
the
mental
process
of
the
reporter
is
precluded.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
that
you
could
ask,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i
think,
your
honor,
you
get
closer
to
an
inquiry
regarding
the
state
of
mind.
i
must
say
i
believe
chief
judge
kaufman's
decision
as
it
stands
now
creates
several
different
interpretations
on
that
issue.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
thank
you.
[luncheon
break]
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
answer
to
the
open
question,
so
to
speak,
it's
difficult
to
give
a
precise
answer
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
means
in
connection
with
whether
questions
of
--
whether
the
defendant
knew
of
certain
things
would
be
permitted.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i'm
sorry?
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
no,
no
majority
opinion.
there's
an
opinion
by
chief
judge
kaufman
who
seems
to
indicate
that
perhaps
you
can
ask
questions
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
well,
i
think
the
chief
judge's
opinion
at
page
40
--
at
22a
of
the
appendix
describes
what
plaintiff
has
already
done
in
the
course
of
discovery
and
states
that
he
has
already
discovered
what
lando
knew,
saw,
said
and
wrote
during
his
investigation.
then
subsequently,
he
states,
now,
herbert
wishes
to
probe
further
and
inquire
into
lando's
thoughts,
opinions,
and
conclusions.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes
it
does.
however,
when
you
get
into
the
question
of
the
editorial
process
issue
and
look
not
only
to
the
chief
judge's
opinion
but
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
oakes,
where
he
states
at
42a,
it
is
quite
another
--
i'm
sorry,
it
starts
off,
“thus,
it
is
one
thing
to
tell
the
press
that
its
end
product
is
subject
to
the
actual
malice
standard
and
that
a
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
prove
actual
malice.
it
is
quite
another
to
say
that
the
editorial
process,
which
produced
the
end
product
in
question,
is
itself
discoverable.”
now,
if
during
the
editorial
process
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
however,
if
it's
discoverable
in
a
time
period
that
might
be
described
as
the
editorial
process
time
period,
which
both
of
the
opinions
say
cannot
be
inquired
into.
for
example,
if
we
were
to
ask
whether
during
the
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
what
--
i
don't
--
i
think
we
possibly
could
ask
that.
however,
what
we
could
not
ask
is
what
it
is
he
knew
or
came
to
know
during
that
process.
for
example
what
if
mike
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
the
problem
is,
we
wouldn't
know
what
is
is
he
came
out
with
knowing.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
we
would
have
to
ask
him
every
--
knowing
every
issue
on
every
aspect
of
the
case,
we
would
not
be
able
to
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
but
we
would
not
be
able
to
find
out
what
--
how
it
is
that
he
came
to
know
something.
for
example,
what
if
during
the
process,
mike
wallace
said
to
barry
lando
or
somebody
else
from
cbs
said
to
barry
lando,
i
went
in
to
this
person
who's
involved
in
your
program,
who
you've
interviewed,
and
he
tells
me
something
which
is
contrary
to
what
he
told
you.
this
is
during
the
editorial
process,
the
conversation
within
cbs.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i
think
that
it's
possible
that
the
defendants
could
raise
the
question
that
if
it
was
told
to
the
defendants
during
the
editorial
process
by
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
in
the
course
of
the
editorial
process
yes
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
it
may
well
--
i
can't
say,
i
would
argue
obviously
if
it
came
up
in
the
district
court,
i
would
argue
if
you
could,
but
i
don't
--
i
cannot
say
with
confidence
that,
that
answer
is
supported
by
the
two
decisions
which
form
the
majority.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
no,
i
do
not
think
and
it
would
be
quite
clear
on
this,
i
do
not
think
we
could
ask
that.
what
we
cannot
ask
is
what
did
he
think
about
what
he
learned,
or
what
he
knew.
for
example
and
this
i
a
concrete
example
in
this
case
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
that's
right,
that's
right.
i
do
not
think
we
can
ask
that
question.
for
example
he
interviewed
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
we
can't
--
that's
right
and
also
we
can't
answer
whether
--
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
or
did
you
think
you
had
to
check
it
further.
for
example
he
interviewed
an
assaulter
by
the
name
of
the
name
of
bob
stanley.
the
defendant
produced
notes
which
they
have
to
check
with
stanley
further.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
no,
in
fact
there
was
a
question
of
sources
which
was
then
waived
by
cbs,
there
is
no
source
problem
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
say
i
see
that
white
light
is
on,
i
want
reserve
a
little
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
did
want
just
focus
on
the
branzburg
analysis
by
the
plurality
of
this
court,
plus
justice
powell's
concurrence
in
branzburg,
as
it
was
further
elucidated
by
the
justice
in
footnote
3
in
gertz
that
the
proper
approach
to
questions
of
discovery
where
the
first
amendment
is
implicated
is
a
case
by
case
approach,
with
questions
of
specificity
relevance
in
materiality,
importance
to
the
court
issues
of
the
case
explored
by
the
district
judge.
and
district
judge
haight
in
this
case
did
explore
those
issues,
and
did
attempt
to,
and
came
to
conclusions
giving
due
care
and
consideration
for
the
first
amendment
values.
what
he
did
not
do
and
apparently
what
the
respondents
complain
of,
he
did
not
established
a
privilege
by
which
the
defendants
can
refuse
to
answer
questions
involving
their
subjective
state
of
mind,
the
very
issue
in
a
sullivan
case.
i
would
reserve
to
this
of
my
time
thank
you.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
very
briefly,
in
regard
to
reference
to
the
sullivan
decision
itself,
the
reference
to
the
looking
at
the
files,
the
issue
that
gets
raised
now
by
the
second
circuit
decision
is
suppose
an
editor
at
the
time
that
the
work
product
was
being
worked
up,
the
editorial
process
was
going
on,
went
to
the
files
and
looked
at
the
files
during
that
editorial
process.
the
question
is,
could
we
ask
a
question
about
what
was
done
during
the
editorial
process?
i
think
that
question
is
a
serious
question
in
light
of
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
which
appears
to
say
that
we
can't
inquire
as
to
what
was
done
during
that
process.
in
addition,
in
the
sullivan
case
itself,
in
reference
to
whether
the
media
are
the
only
groups
of
people
that
are
protected
under
the
sullivan
principles,
i'm
sure,
needless
to
say,
the
court
is
aware
that
individuals
were
as
well,
petitioners
before
this
court
in
sullivan,
the
ministers
themselves,
and
they
were
afforded
the
protection
of
the
sullivan
principles
as
well
as
the
new
york
times.
so
i
think
from
sullivan
on,
there
has
been
at
least
an
implied
recognition
that
the
sullivan
principles
protect
anyone
who
exercises
his
first
amendment
rights,
first
in
regard
to
public
officials,
and
subsequently
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
regard
to
public
figures.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i
believe
what
he
is
referring
to,
your
honor,
is
the
certification
memorandum
opinion
and
order
because
as
to
whether
you
can
specify
and
focus
upon
a
specific
certified
question,
i
don't
find
it.
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
i
believe
so,
and
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
second
memorandum
opinion
and
order
of
judge
haight,
beginning
at
90(a)
to
the
petition
in
which
he
certifies
under
1292(b).
mr.
jonathan
w.
lubell
yes,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
it
came
up
on
a
certified
--
on
a
certification
procedure
and
the
certified
question
involved
the
same
question
that
judge
haight
said
was
a
question
of
first
impression,
which
had
to
do
with
the
state
of
mind,
or
whether
there
was
a
privilege
for
the
editorial
process
of
the
press.
further,
in
regard
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
posed
to
mr.
abrams
as
to
criminal
cases
where
defendant
does
take
the
stand,
or
any
civil
case
where
defendant
does
take
the
stand,
and
the
issue
of
state
of
mind
is
an
issue,
whether
it
would
be
because
malice
or
intent
required.
obviously,
the
defendant
must
answer
those
questions
unless
a
testimonial
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
one
of
the
recognized
testimonial
privileges
is
asserted.
in
this
case,
in
fact,
the
defendant,
in
a
pre-trial
sense,
took
the
stand.
he
submitted
himself
to
a
deposition
and
questions
were
asked
to
him
about
his
state
of
mind
within
concrete,
factual
contexts
only
because
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
subjective
state
of
mind
has
become
the
critical
sullivan
issue.
in
regard
to
the
--
again,
back
to
the
question
of
what
questions
appeared
to
be
allowable,
or
would
not
appear
to
be
allowable,
i
would
note
that
the
defendants
have
objected
at
the
deposition
stage,
and
have
contended
throughout
the
appeals
here,
that
questions
as
to
the
defendants'
view
of
the
credibility
and
veracity
of
persons
who
appeared
on
the
program,
as
well
as
persons
who
did
not
appear
on
the
program,
were
not
proper.
so,
that
it's
not
limited
to
somebody
who
did
not
appear
on
the
program.
i
see
both
my
lights
are
on
and
in
conclusion,
we
contend
that
by
precluding
a
plaintiff
from
obtaining
any
direct
evidence
of
state
of
mind
in
a
sullivan
case,
or
obtaining
any
evidence
of
what
happened
in
the
editorial
process,
whichever
way
you
interpret
the
two
aspects
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
completely
unbalances
the
accommodation
struck
by
this
court
in
sullivan
and
its
progeny.
thank
you.
