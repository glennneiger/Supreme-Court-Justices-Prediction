mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
if
i
may
my
outlining
briefly
what
we
considered
at
the
time
and
still
consider
the
vice
of
the
district
court
opinion
and
then
to
proceed
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
some
of
the
questions
which
members
of
this
court
have
addressed,
to
mr.
lubell.
the
crux
of
the
district
court
opinion,
mr.
lubell
to
the
contrary
was
not
that
the
questions
asked
went
to
the
core
of
the
case,
and
it
was
not
that
the
questions
asked
provided
information
which
could
only
be
obtained
from
the
journalists
involved.
those
were
not
findings
of
the
district
court
and
indeed
as
i
read
the
district
court
opinion
they
are
inconsistent
with
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
concluded
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
concept
of
editorial
process
which
we
urged
upon
him,
stemming
from
cases
of
this
court
such
as
of
the
miami
herald
case,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
the
scope
of
pretrial
discovery
in
the
sullivan
case.
at
that
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
our
argument
mr.
chief
justice
is
this.
we
think
that
what
the
court
establish
in
the
tornillo
case
was,
that
it's
now
it
was
of
course
of
the
right
of
reply
statute
was
unconstitutional,
but
broader
than
that,
we
think
it
established
a
first
amendment
proposition,
that
at
least
to
close
inquiry
into
the
editorial
process
of
a
newspaper
or
in
this
case
a
broadcaster,
is
itself
barred
or
at
least
presumptively
barred
under
the
first
amendment.
if
it
i
can
give
you
a
hypothetical;
if
florida
had
respondent
to
this
courts
ruling
in
the
tornillo
case,
by
passing
a
new
statute
requiring
that
a
newspaper
which
did
not
print
an
answer
have
to
disclose
why
it
didn't
print
an
answer.
mr.
floyd
abrams
absolutely
not.
i
am
not,
your
honor
i
am
not
urging
that
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
am
without
question
or
going
beyond
that
case,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
underlying
theory
of
that
case
ought
not
to
be
limited
to
right
of
reply
statutes
any
more
than
you
would
limit
i
think,
mills
versus
alabama
to
limitations
on
what
occurs
on
election
day,
and
what
can
be
printed
by
a
newspaper
on
election
day.
we
think
what
the
court
should
do,
but
it
has
not
yet
done,
and
this
was
the
first
case
since
tornillo
in
which
this
is
raised,
excuse
me
and
what
we
think
the
second
circuit
concluded
as
well
as
that
the
underlying
basis
of
tornillo
is
not
alone.
that
right
of
reply
statutes
are
unconstitutional,
but
that
the
choice
of
material
by
editors
to
go
in
newspapers
are
on
broadcast,
the
treatment
of
material
to
go
and
the
nature
of
content,
as
at
least
presumptively
protect
to
just
as
i
think
it
would
be,
if
in
the
florida
case,
the
florida
legislature,
again
in
the
hypothetical.
if
the
florida
legislature,
after
your
ruling
has
subpoena
to
the
editor
of
the
editor
of
the
miami
herald
and
asked
him
the
very
questions,
the
very
questions
asked
of
barry
lando
in
this
case,
in
affect
why
did
you
print
this
and
not
that?
what
was
the
nature
of
your
editorial
decision
making?
i
do
not
suggest
that
this
is
what
the
court
held
in
tornillo,
of
course
it
did
not.
but
we
do
think
that
it
is
consistent
with
tornillo
and
that
the
kind
of
dedication
to
the
notion
of
editorial
process
protection
which
is
embodied
in
tornillo
itself,
ought
to
be
embodied
here
as
well.
i
think
i
can
best
illustrate
it
by
reference
to
mr.
lubell's
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens
earlier
in
which
he
was
asked
what's
the
best
example
that
you've
got.
what
is
that
you
are
really
loosing?
what
kind
of
questions
aren't
being
answered
here
and
mr.
lubell
gave
an
example
which
i
think
is
a
fair
example,
of
a
situation
in
which
a
particular
individual
was
interviewed
on
the
program.
on
the
page
reference,
if
the
court
wishes
to
see
it
later,
is
at
53(a)
of
the
appendix
and
this
person
who
had
served
with
colonel
herbert
in
the
army,
bruce
potter
by
name,
said
on
the
program,
that
he
was
in
a
helicopter
with
colonel
herbert
and
that
in
the
helicopter
next
to
colonel
herbert,
colonel
herbert
had
suggested
by
thrusting
a
prisoner
of
war
towards
the
open
door
of
the
helicopter,
that
he
might
throw
him
out.
and
the
colonel
herbert
had
as
well
thrown
sand
bags
out
to
suggest
to
people
on
the
ground,
a
prisoner
on
the
ground
that,
there
were
people
being
thrown
out
of
planes
and
that
therefore
they
should
talk,
and
that's
what
bruce
potter
said.
mr.
floyd
abrams
your
honor
i
don't
think
it's
defamatory,
it
is
their
position
that,
that
is
defamatory
per
se.
i
don't
think
that
even
states
a
cause
of
action
to
say
colonel
herbert
is
quote
“capable
of
brutality”.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
don't
think
it
would
be
defamatory
even
then
in
times
of
war.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
am
sorry
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
yes
that's
a
question
of
new
york
law,
and
i
think
new
york
law
is
to
some
extent
at
least
has
been
constitutionalised
as
to
what
is
defamatory.
this
court
hasn't
yet
ruled
on
the
scope
of
first
amendment
protection,
if
any,
in
terms
of
the
definition
of
what
is
defamatory,
but
there
is
a
second
circuit
ruling
which
so
holds
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
your
honor
i
fully
agree
that
in
order
to
prevail
a
plaintiff
in
a
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
case
must
either
prove
that
in
this
case,
cbs
knew
what
it
was
broadcasting
was
untrue
or
broadcasts
with
reckless
disregard
of
truth
or
falsity
meaning
with
serious
doubts
has
to
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
don't
dispute
that
at
all.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
the
plaintiff
finds
it
out
your
honor
first
of
all
that
it
kind
of
material
he
was
given.
there
was
extraordinary
amount
of
production
in
this
case.
i
don't
want
to
limit
it
or
argument
that
i
just
did
in
this
case,
but
i
think
that
judge
kaufman's
opinion
is
clearly
informed
by
what
it
is
that
the
plaintiff
had
in
this
case.
and
if
i
may
say
so
there
is
no
suggestion
at
all
in
any
opinion
of
any
court
in
this
case,
if
there
was
a
selective
production
for
the
purpose
of
making
cbs
look
any
better
and
what
judge
kaufman
said.
mr.
floyd
abrams
exactly
mr.
justice
white,
here
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
perhaps
that
and
even
that
was
not
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
all
questions
that
were
asked
about
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
what
did
you
learn
or
what
did
you
know?
who
did
you
talk
to?
who
did
you
interview
as
judge
kaufman
said
the
form
and
frequency
of
communications
with
sources,
including
transcripts
of
interviews.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
that
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
gets
a
lot
closer
to
what
answers
were
not
given
in
this
case.
mr.
floyd
abrams
you
are
right.
if
to
refer
the
questions
involved
here,
i
will
assert
to
you
at
least
that
there
are
setup
questions
for
our
side.
these
are
not
difficult
questions
to
ask.
we
may
be
right
or
wrong
on
the
principle
that
we
assert
to
you
today
about
first
amendment
protection,
but
these
are
not
difficult
questions
to
answer.
these
are
questions
were,
“were
you
interested
in
showing
a
balanced
view
point
as
to
colonel
herbert's
treatment
of
the
vietnamese?”
now,
no
--
at
least
in
my
experience,
i
don't
know
anybody
would
have
much
trouble
responding
to
that
kind
of
question.
now,
that
may
or
may
not
implicate
editorial
process.
editorial
process
may
or
may
not
be
protected,
and
we
think
it
is,
and
we
think
that's
it.
but
i
think
it's
very
important
and
i
have
just
been
asked
as
well
how
is
the
plaintiff
to
prove
this
case?
well,
what
does
the
plaintiff
have
to
do?
what
kind
of
evidence
can
he
have
and
our
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
to
prove
his
case
first
by
all
of
the
facts,
all
of
the
objective
facts.
what
happened?
who
did
he
interview?
what
did
he
know
and
what
was
really
happening?
if
the
program
is
wrong,
if
there
are
people
on
the
outside
who
will
come
in
and
testify,
that
it
is
not
true,
that
certain
things
occur
and
that
for
some
reasons
cbs
knew
that
it
wasn't
true.
what
would
be
more
prohibitive
than
that
and
that's
the
way
you
prove
the
security's
case.
mr.
floyd
abrams
those
questions
have
all
been
answered,
your
honor.
there
is
really
no
dispute
in
this
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
sir,
but
there
is
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
all
the
questions
about,
what
cbs
knew
have
been
answered.
what
have
not
been
answered
are
questions
which
as
judge
kaufman
characterizes
a
small
number
of
questions
relating
to
his
beliefs,
opinions
and
intent
and
conclusions
and
preparing
the
program.
now,
i
would
concede
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
right.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
let
me
say
that
if
he
will
ask
the
question
and
he
was
not,
did
you
believe
what
was
on
the
program,
and
there
are
no
such
questions
at
issue
here,
we
would
not
have
objected
and
i
do
not
read
the
opinions
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
that,
that
falls
within
the
area
of
protected
information,
your
honor.
let
me
say
that
i
think,
that
one
could
make
and
rather
easily
make
some
gradations
of
protection
here.
to
the
extent
that
one
takes
as,
one's
load
star
here
a
notion
of
--
and
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
it
is
necessarily
and
amorphous,
a
developing
concept
to
editorial
process.
what
is
most
important
is
what
was
on
the
program
and
what
was
off
the
the
program
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
single
most
protected
thing
in
this
area
are
questions
such
as
mr.
lubell
referred
to
earlier
which
is
why
didn't
he
put
the
four
people
on,
who
had
good
things
about
colonel
herbert.
now,
that
it
seems
to
me
goes
to
the
absolute
core
of
what
should
be
protected
in
this
area.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
--
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
let
me
say,
i
was
distinguishing,
i
meant
to
distinguish
between
the
example
that
i
just
posed
and
the
did
you
believe
question,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
necessarily
a
step
away.
as
i
have
said
we
have
not
urged
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
think
that,
that
should
fall
as
well
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
within
the
area.
mr.
floyd
abrams
because
it
seems
to
me
that,
that's
a
probe
that
deeply
into
the
mind
of
the
journalist
is
first
of
all
not
necessary
in
order
to
allow
the
plaintiff
to
prove
his
case.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
question
which
is
historically
led
so
far
as
i
know
any
plaintiff
to
win
a
libel
case
governed
by
new
york
times
against
sullivan.
and
i
think
that,
and
this
is
the
question
before
you,
i
think
that
to
make
the
journalist
answer
the
question,
not
about
did
you
believe
what
was
on
the
program
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
question
wasn't
ask
and
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
will
think
that
questions
as
to
what
the
journalist
knew
are
questions
which
he
ought
to
answer,
but
it
seems
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
some
sort,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
aren't
any
kind
of
grade
scale
that
--
as
you
go
down
that
road,
at
the
end
of
it
at
least,
is
why
didn't
you
put
these
four
people
on,
who
said
something
good
about
colonel
herbert.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there's
is
no
objection
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
and
there
was
no
objection
to
any
such
questions.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
an
objection
were
made
mr.
justice
marshall
by
the
defendant
in
this
case,
any
question
that
was
objected
to,
it
seems
to
me
could
not
be
testified
affirmatively
to
by
the
press.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
that
if
we
object
to
any
question
on
this
basis
at
pre-trial,
we
could
hardly
be
the
ones
to
introduce
evidence
to
that
effect
at
the
trial.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
am
sorry
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
have
taken
the
decision
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
all
questions
are
proper
as
to
what
was
on
the
program
that
is
to
say,
did
you
believe
so
and
so
insofar
as
what
he
said
on
the
program
we
think
is
a
proper
question
and
we
would
not
have
objected
to
such
questions.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
it
was
broadcast
on
the
program,
my
answer
to
you
is
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
think
that
justice
marshall
that
question
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
know
what
the
answers
would
be
to
all
of
these
questions.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
right
--
and
what
i
said
is
that,
we
have
not
--
mr.
lubell
has
not
asked
these
question,
but
we
would
not
have
objected
it
and
we
do
not
maintain
that
the
privilege
that
we
seek
here
protects
against
a
response
to
the
question
about
whether
anything
that
was
on
the
program
was
believed
by
the
journalist
or
was
known
by
the
journalist
to
be
untrue.
that
it
seems
to
me
is,
if
nothing
else
waived
by
the
very
fact
of
putting
it
on
the
program.
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
is,
questions
as
to
the
selective
process
of
inclusion
and
exclusion
and
particularly
the
material
that
was
excluded
from
the
program.
mr.
floyd
abrams
but
when
i
concluded
from
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
a
question
as
to
the
belief
of
material
which
was
actually
broadcast
on
the
program.
and
what
i
have
said
is
that
--
that
which
is
broadcast
on
the
program
or
printed
in
the
newspaper,
it
seems
to
us
is
material
which
the
journalist
ought
to
be
prepared
to
respond
to.
where
we
start
to
differ
is
that
material
that
was
either
not
broadcast
on
the
program
or
beliefs,
conclusions
about
witnesses
in
general,
not
about,
particular
material.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
your
honor,
there
are
no
--
i
ask
you
to
look
at
the
questions
here,
that's
not
a
question
i
couldn't
answer.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
it
would
be
a
very
rare
liable
case
indeed.
if
the
kind
of
answers
that
you
would
get
to
kind
of
questions
that
you
raise
or
the
kind
of
questions
asked
here,
did
you
consider
doing
something
that
you
didn't
do,
these
are
not
difficult
questions,
at
least
in
my
experience.
i
think
in
the
st.
amant
case,
this
court
indicated
by
way
of
illustration
i
think,
but
indicated
the
kinds
of
ways
to
prove
reckless
disregard.
and
the
kind
of
examples
that
the
court
gave
there
were
where
the
story
is
fabricated,
where
the
story
is
a
product
or
the
reporter's
imagination,
where
the
story
is
based
upon
an
unverified,
anonymous
telephone
call,
where
the
publisher's
allegation
is
so
inherently
improbable
that
only
a
reckless
man
would
have
put
them
in
circulation,
where
there
are
obvious
reasons
to
doubt
the
veracity
of
the
informant
or
the
accuracy
of
his
reports,
we
are
providing
all
the
objective
information
from
which
those
kinds
of
things,
and
more
can
be
determined.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
correct.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
way
it
has
been
done
in
libel
cases,
and
the
way
it
is
routinely
done
in
criminal
cases,
and
security's
act
cases,
and
antitrust
cases,
is
for
a
jury
to
infer
a
particular
state
of
mind
from
a
particular
set
of
facts.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
once
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
in
that
type
of
situation,
and
to
the
extent
that
that's
a
relevant
issue,
he
certainly
can.
but
the
fact
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir,
it
would.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
a
more
standard,
or
another
criminal
example
would
be
whether
the
defendant
doesn't
take
the
stand
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
but
the
question
before
you
is,
are
we
entitled
not
to
respond
to
certain
questions?
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
analogy
to
the
defendant
who
has
respects
to
--
who
does
not
make
a
self-defense
argument,
but
simply
puts
the
prosecution
to
its
proof
and
in
that
type
of
situation
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
unless
you
are
--
you
must
take
the
stand.
but
unless
you
are
privileged
not
to
respond
to
certain
questions,
and
that
is
indeed
the
question
before
you.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
this
will
take
a
moment
or
two,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
is
yet
to
rule
on
whether
the
gertz
case,
first
of
all
applies
alone
to
the
press
and
the
media
or
to
other
entities
and
so
that
would
be
a
threshold
ruling
for
the
court
to
make
as
to
whether
there
is
any
different
treatment
under
libel
law,
or
under
slander
law.
if
the
treatment
is
the
same,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
there
are
special
reasons
why
reporters
need
this
protection.
i
do
not
take
the
position
that
individual
speakers
cannot
get
the
protection.
i
don't
think
that's
before
you,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
in
fact
the
only
people
that
engage
in
the
kind
of
process
we're
talking
about
here
tend
to
be
journalists.
i
suppose
i
could
conceive
a
situation
where
that
were
not
true,
but
certainly
on
a
regular
basis
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
are
manly
libel
cases,
and
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
the
only
open
question
is
whether
this
protection
ought
to
go
to
the
“press,”
including
a
lot
more
than
journalists
--
or
to
the
press
and
speakers
as
well
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--
or
to
the
press
and
speakers
as
well.
mr.
floyd
abrams
write
a
book
or
a
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
floyd
abrams
right.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
saying
the
first
thing
i
would
have
to
know,
your
honor,
is
whether
new
york
times
against
sullivan
protects
the
individual
in
that
type
of
situation
and
what
i
was
observing
is
that
i
don't
think
this
court
has
yet
ruled
on
the
question
of
whether
the
sullivan
case
does
afford
such
protection.
if
it
does,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
particular
reasons
why
the
press
needs
this
protection
because
of
the
nature
of
the
process
it
is
engaged
in,
the
regularity
of
it
and
the
like,
but
that
i
certainly
wouldn't
oppose
it
for
anyone
else.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
often
get
cases
before
you,
which
have
peculiar
applicability
to
one
or
another
body
of
life
in
the
country.
the
tornillo
case
is
one.
it
may
not
be
just
a
press
case,
but
it
is
unlikely
to
arise
in
the
context
of
a
statute
requiring
individuals
to
speak
in
reply
to
things
that
other
people
have
said
and
i
think
that
that's
the
same
proposition
here.
you
need
not
say,
and
we
don't
urge
you
to
say,
that
the
first
amendment
protection
that
we
think
exists
here,
and
should
exist
here,
is
limited
to
the
press.
but
in
all
candor,
i
have
to
tell
you,
i
don't
know
that
it
will
often
arise
in
situations
which
don't
involve
the
press
or
writers
or
people
who
are
engage
in
the
kind
of
process
which
cbs
news,
in
this
case,
has
in
fact
engaged
in.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
the
only
type
of
situation
is
that
--
i'm
trying
to
think
of
cases
where
malice
is
in
fact
at
issue.
our
case
here
is
the
first
libel
case
on
one
side
or
another
which
relates
to
this
question.
insofar
as
criminal
cases
are
involved,
they
wouldn't
really
involve
malice.
i
can't
think
offhand
of
an
answer.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
10(b)
--
i
was
limiting
my
answer
to
the
question
of
malice
but
in
terms
of
intent
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
state
of
mind
or
intent
is
routinely
proved
in
10(b)(5)
cases
by
reference
to
what
the
person
did
and
what
the
person
knew.
kw
but
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
there
shouldn't
be
cross-examination
about
his
state
of
mind?
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
i
would
not
suggest
that
and
i
have
no
reason
to
think
of
that
is
constitutionally
privileged.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
as
a
general
matter,
certainly.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
it
is
indeed
one
of
the
analogies
that
we
urge
on
you
in
our
brief
is
that
of
executive
privilege,
is
that
indeed
as
the
court
observed
in
the
nixon
case,
that
human
experience
teaches
us
that
people
will
speak
less
freely
in
that
type
situation
if
they
know
that
what
they're
going
to
say
is
going
to
be
exposed
to
public
dissemination.
there
are
similar
rulings
with
respect
to
far
lower-level
people
in
the
executive
branch,
the
mental
processes
of
which
are
at
least
generally
barred
from
disclosure.
similar
rulings
under
that
speech
and
debate
clause
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
in
a
criminal
case,
that
is
correct.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
appreciate
that.
i
think
that
would
be
a
high
price
to
put
on
this
privilege,
if
you
should
sustain
the
privilege.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
our
position
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not
that
we
cannot
respond,
but
that
you
ought
to
rule
that
we
need
not
respond,
and
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
that
were
the
nature
of
any
privilege
granted
by
the
court
in
this
area,
it
would
not
be
very
expansive.
mr.
floyd
abrams
he
can
certainly
have
the
whole
transcript
at
the
outset,
in
order
to
make
judgments
based
on
that.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
and
if
the
process
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
those
kinds
of
discussions
in
the
office,
as
opposed
to
the
facts
of
what
he
had,
what
he
knew,
and
what
he
did,
should
indeed
be
protected
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
precise
analogy
to
that
is,
in
fact,
the
executive
privilege
cases
and
the
variety
of
other
cases
about
the
nature
of
discussions
in
situations
like
that.
at
the
very
least,
it
is
our
view
that
they
should
presumptively
be
protected,
and
that
if
they're
to
be
overcome,
they
should
be
overcome
in
very
rare
circumstances.
one
of
the
worst
problems
with
this
case
is
that
the
effect
of
it
is
that
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
what
is
chilled
are
the
people
who
speak
to
each
other
in
the
newsroom,
aware
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
oh,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
has
happened.
on
the
other
hand,
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
discovery
has
gone
on
for
26
days
and
2900
pages
in
a
libel
case.
if
this
case
is
lost,
mr.
justice
marshall,
or
if
i
may
say
so,
if
there
is
no
protection
at
all
here,
i
think
it
fair
to
predict
that
questions
like
this
will,
for
the
first
time,
become
routine,
that
public
officials
and
pubic
figures,
the
very
people
set
out
by
this
court
in
sullivan
as
being,
for
a
variety
of
societal
reasons,
people
who
will
receive
less
protection
against
defamatory
falsehoods
than
other
people,
will
be
able
to
commence
libel
actions
and
immediately
plunge
into
the
core
questions
at
issue
here,
why
did
you
write
these
bad
things
about
me?
why
didn't
you
put
on
the
good
things
about
me?
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
never
did,
i
don't
want
to
follow
that
up,
but
it
never
did.
mr.
floyd
abrams
not
state
of
mind
inquiry
because
at
that
point
the
test
was
wholly
truth
or
falsity,
was
it
privileged
under
sullivan
statement.
mr.
floyd
abrams
for
punitive
damages,
it
sometimes
came
up
in
very
specific
and
narrow
circumstances,
not
questions
as
to
why
certain
material
was
included
and
excluded.
punitive
damage
questions
were
historically
the
questions
about,
what
did
you
think
of
him?
what
was
your
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
actual
malice
in
non-constitutional
terms.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
first
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
don't
think
it
so,
your
honor.
i
have
read
the
article.
there's
been
no
finding
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
sir.
there's
been
no
finding
by
any
lower
court
that
that
is
the
case.
if
there
is
a
waiver
problem
here
at
all,
either
by
virtue
of
the
atlantic
monthly
article,
or
by
virtue
of
any
answers
which
were
inadvertently
given
in
the
course
of
the
26
days
over
which
this
was
spread.
it
seems
to
me
that's
something
for
the
district
court
to
deal
with.
we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
waiver.
mr.
floyd
abrams
you
would
ask
the
person
in
charge
of
advertising
acceptability
at
the
new
york
times,
what
did
you
know?
did
you
look
at
the
files?
what
was
in
the
files?
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
let
me
say
first,
your
honor,
that
the
files
here
have
been
turned
over.
so
insofar
as
the
files
as
such
are
concerned
--
and
they
objectively
reflect
what
is
at
issue
that
can
be
obtained.
what
cannot
be
obtained
are
directly
by
way
of
questions,
in
our
view
when
i
think
in
view
of
both
judge
kaufman
and
judge
oakes,
are
the
individualistic,
tentative,
probing,
conclusions,
musings,
whatever,
of
journalists
as
they
go
about
their
job.
but
all
the
objective
questions
as
to
what
was
there,
what
happened,
what
happened
next,
what
didn't
they
look
at,
what
did
they
look
at,
that's
what
was
lacking
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
for
the
plaintiff
to
have
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
are
what?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
seems
to
us
that
conversations
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
that
is
--
it
is
a
different
area,
your
honor,
it
is
and
it
seems
to
us
that
that
also
should
be
privileged,
but
that
the
policy
basis
for
some
of
these
are
somewhat
different
and
i
tried
to
set
forth
but
they
aren't.
mr.
floyd
abrams
misreading
of
the
opinions
by
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
--
yes.
yes,
i
think
that
this
is
true.
that
it
is
certainly
misread
if
it
is
read
as
an
end
to
libel
law,
and
it
is
misread
if
it
is
read
as
a
total,
absolute
privilege
in
every
case
which
could
conceivably
be
characterized
as
“editorial
process.”
i
don't
think
that's
what
it
says,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
either
judge
kaufman
or
judge
oakes
have
to
say.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
started
to
respond
to
a
question
that
you
had
asked
mr.
lubell.
mr.
floyd
abrams
starting
about
halfway
down
on
page
53
(a),
there
was
an
interview
on
the
program
with
bruce
potter,
and
that
was,
i
think
what
mr.
lubell
was
adverting
to
earlier
and
i
described
it
briefly
about
how
mr.
potter
said
that
in
his
presence
colonel
herbert
had
thrown
a
sandbag
out
and
as
well
had
made
threatening
gestures
towards
a
prisoner
of
war.
mr.
lubell's
examples
was
that
example,
and
what
he
said
to
you
was
that
there
were
four
people
on
the
other
side.
what
i
wanted
to
say
in
response
to
that
was,
first
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
four
people
were
not
on
the
helicopter
and
had
nothing
to
say
as
such
about
what
happened
there.
but
what
they
did
say
were
good
things
about
colonel
herbert
in
terms
of
his
desire
to
care
for,
to
be
compassionate
towards
prisoners
of
war
and
they
were
not
on
the
program.
although
what
was
on
the
program
was
a
statement
of
mr.
wallace,
saying
in
so
many
words,
that
there
are
people
who
they
had
interviewed,
who
cbs
had
interviewed,
who
took
the
position
that
colonel
herbert
was
not
capable
of
brutality.
the
point
that
i
was
going
to
make
was
only
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
very,
very
dangerous
line
for
libel
law
to
go
down,
either
substantively
or
procedurally,
if
we're
talking
about
procedure
today,
and
allowing
questions
about
that
because
the
nature
of
those
questions
is
nothing
less
than,
why
didn't
you
put
the
good
material
on?
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
certainly
wouldn't
have
objected
to
a
question
asking
whether
he
had
any
doubt
about
the
credibility
of
what
mr.
potter
had
to
say
on
the
program.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
sorry?
mr.
floyd
abrams
in
what
he
said
on
the
program?
we
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
then
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
further
step
away.
it
seems
to
me
that
journalists
ought
to
be
responsible
for
what
they
put
on.
mr.
floyd
abrams
because
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
put
it
--
i
think
they
both
involved
conceptually
the
editorial
process,
but
when
the
process
is
broadcast,
it's
out.
mr.
floyd
abrams
when
the
segment
at
page
53
and
54
(a)
is
on
the
program,
it
seems
to
me,
even
though
that
is
a
result
of
a
process,
the
journalist
has
to
respond
to
the
question
as
to
whether
he
believed
it
or
not.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
permissible
to
ask,
did
you
believe
the
statement
of
mr.
potter
which
you
broadcast
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
questions
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
the
effect
of,
why
did
you
put
it
on
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position
that
that
should
not
be
permissible.
we
think
that
the
product
broadcast
ought
to
be
what
is
at
issue,
and
that
that
can
be
inquired
into,
but
not
the
process
by
which
other
things
did
not
get
put
on.
mr.
floyd
abrams
thank
you,
your
honor.
