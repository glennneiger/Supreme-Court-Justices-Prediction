mr.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission,
now
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
validly
interpreted
the
natural
gas
act
when
it
held
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act
for
the
commission
to
approved
as
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
above
the
otherwise
applicable
ceiling
rate
and
for
the
commission
thus
to
pass
through
to
interstate
pipelines
and
hence
to
the
consuming
public
incremental
royalty
costs
based
on
the
price
of
natural
gas
in
the
unregulated
intrastate
market.
respondents
shell
and
pennzoil
produced
gas
from
a
field
in
southern
louisiana
and
sell
it
in
interstate
commerce
under
certificates
granted
by
the
commission
to
united
gas
pipeline
company,
an
interstate
pipeline.
the
gas
is
produced
by
shell
and
pennzoil
under
leases
granted
by
the
landowner
lessor,
williams
in
1934
and
1952.
the
1934
lease
provides
for
royalty
to
williams
of
one-eighth
of
the
value
of
the
gas
produced.
the
1952
lease
provides
for
royalty
of
the
one-fourth
of
the
value
of
the
gas
produced.
in
each
case,
the
value
is
to
be
calculated
at
the
market
price
or
the
market
rate
prevailing
at
well.
shell
and
pennzoil
had
always
computed
and
paid
their
royalties
as
fractions
of
the
market
rates
that
they
actually
received
by
selling
the
gas
to
united,
rates
in
which
since
this
court's
1954
decision
in
the
phillips
case
have
been
set
by
the
commission.
thus
in
1975,
the
applicable
commission
rates
to
the
gas
in
this
case
were
approximately
31
cents
and
approximately
60
cents.
beginning
in
1973,
however,
williams
demand
that
payment
from
shell
and
pennzoil
of
royalties
based
on
the
market
value
of
the
natural
gas
in
the
unregulated
intrastate
market.
these
values
were
said
by
williams
to
range
from
35
cents
to
70
cents
per
mcf
for
the
period
through
mid
1974
and
then
from
1974
to
1975
from
a
$1.30
to
$1.40
per
mcf.
when
shell
and
pennzoil
refused
to
pay
these
higher
royalties,
williams
purported
to
terminate
the
leases.
shell
and
pennzoil
then
sued
williams
over
this
question
in
louisiana
state
court.
before
the
court
made
a
ruling,
the
parties
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
contingent
on
approval
by
the
commission.
the
settlement
provides
that
shell
and
pennzoil
would
apply
to
the
commission
for
permission
to
pay
specified
increased
royalties
to
williams
and
to
pass
through
these
increases
to
united.
the
royalties
provided
for
in
the
settlement
were
royalties
based
on,
that
is
the
appropriate
fraction
of
either
a
price
of
78
cents
per
mcf
increasing
1.5
cents
a
year
after
1975.
or
based
on
a
price
of
a
150%
of
the
highest
rate
set
by
the
commission
whichever
was
higher
that
is
whichever
the
78
cents
or
the
150%
of
the
commission
rate
was
higher.
as
an
alternative,
the
settlement
provided
that
shell
and
pennzoil
would
ask
the
commission
for
permission
to
abandon
the
portion
of
the
gas
that
was
attributable
to
the
royalty
interest
that
is
one-eighth
or
one-fourth
so
that
that
gas
could
be
paid
to
williams
as
a
royalty
in
kind
for
sale
by
williams,
wherever
williams
wanted
to
sell
it
presumably
in
the
intrastate
market.
shell
and
pennzoil
then
duly
took
this
agreement
to
the
commission
seeking
its
approval.
the
commission's
administrative
law
judge
denied
the
petition
for
the
special
relief
for
the
higher
rate
that
would
pass
through
this
increment
of
royalties
to
the
pipeline.
the
judge
concluded
that
special
relief
from
an
area
or
a
national
rate
is
warranted
only
when
a
producer
can
demonstrate
that
his
overall
cost
from
the
operation
in
question
are
higher
than
the
commission
ceiling
or
that
is
out
of
pocket
expenses
will
exceed
revenues.
the
judge
found
that
pennzoil
had
made
no
attempt
to
make
any
such
cost
showing
and
that
while
shell
had
made
such
an
attempt,
shell
had
failed.
the
judge
found
in
particular
that
if
shell
were
to
pay
royalties
based
on
the
78-cent
rate
in
the
settlement,
shell
will
still
make
a
profit
of
something
like
$290.00
a
year,
on
the
leases
in
question
under
the
commission's
ceiling
that
is
would
not
need
a
higher
rate
to
make
that
profit.
the
judge
further
found
that
even
if
shell
--
mr.
barnett
well,
we
think
they
are.
mr.
barnett
well,
if
the
standard
is
whether
--
if
the
standard
is
that
in
order
to
obtain
special
relief
from
a
commission
rate,
you
have
to
show
that
you're
cost
would
exceed
your
revenues.
mr.
barnett
well,
if
you
like,
yes.
then
it
certainly
is
meaningful
to
show
that
you
are
making
a
profit
rather
than
a
loss.
mr.
barnett
well,
after
all
costs
that
shell
showed
here.
shell
was
given
an
opportunity
to
show
whatever
costs
it
could
and
after
all
costs
that
showed,
the
administrative
lawyer
judge
found
that
it
would
still
have
a
profit.
mr.
barnett
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor,
except
that
one
can
figure
that
out
by
adding
the
incremental
royalties
to
the
--
to
what
the
administrative
lawyer
judge
found
that
their
profit
would
be
without
it.
in
addition
to
the
denying
the
price
relief,
the
administrative
lawyer
judge
also
denied
the
alternative
abandonment
relief.
the
commission
affirmed
the
denial
of
the
requested
rate
increase
but
on
a
broader
ground
that
the
administrative
lawyer
judge
had
taken.
the
commission
found
that
the
impetus
for
the
settlement
is
the
market
value
of
the
royalties
and
held
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
natural
gas
act
for
it
to
allow
the
pass
through
as
just
and
reasonable
rates
under
the
act
of
such
incremental
royalty
costs
that
were
based
on
the
market
value
of
natural
gas
and
the
unregulated
intrastate
market.
mr.
barnett
the
commission
never
said
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
the
commission
did
put
its
holding
in
terms
of
lacking
authority
that
it
--
mr.
barnett
i
don't
think
it
is
because
the
commission
did
consider
the
question.
the
commission
had
a
full
hearing
and
considered
whether
it
should
grant
the
relief
requested
and
decided
that
it
should
not
because
to
grant
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act.
now
the
commission
phrased
that
holding
in
terms
of
lacking
authority
under
the
act
but
the
commission
made
the
decision
that
it
lack
the
authority.
the
holding
would
be
no
different
if
the
commission
had
simply
said
we
hold
that
the
grant
relief
based
on
incremental
royalties
based
on
the
intrastate
market
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
texaco.
so
while
the
decision
is
phrased
largely
in
terms
of
lacking
authority,
it's
also
phrased
in
terms
of
being
inconsistent
with
the
act.
the
commission
decided
that
it
lack
authority,
it
was
a
decision
made
by
the
commission
and
thus
we
submit
that
the
question
before
the
court
here
is
whether
this
was
a
valid
interpretation
of
the
act
by
the
commission.
mr.
barnett
it
considered
this
case
and
--
mr.
barnett
with
particular
factor.
i
mean
it
decided
that
it
could
not
grant
relief
for
incremental
royalties
based
on
the
intrastate
market.
what
it
decided
that
it
could
not
consider
was
whether
this
particular
royalties
were
reasonably
incurred
and
the
reason
it
decided
that
it
could
not
consider
that
was
because
it
had
decided
as
a
matter
of
law
that
when
the
royalties
are
based
on
the
intrastate
market,
to
allow
them
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act.
the
only
thing
it
refused
to
consider
was
the
particularized
question
of
whether
these
royalties
were
reasonably
incurred.
the
commission
also
--
mr.
barnett
yes,
the
commission
decided
that
it
would
violate
the
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
texaco
case
for
it
to
grant
relief
in
this
case
or
in
any
similar
case
where
special
relief
is
sought
based
on
incremental
royalties
based
on
the
unregulated
market
price.
mr.
barnett
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
commission's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor
so
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
think
it
is
the
position
that
commission
took
in
its
order
and
its
orders
on
rehearing.
mr.
barnett
i
think
it
does.
i
think
--
mr.
barnett
i
think
it
does
as
in
the
previous
case
if
i
were
writing
the
commission's
opinion
just
as
if
i
were
writing
the
act
of
congress.
i
like
to
think
i
could
a
better
job
but
i
think
here
the
commission's
decision
is
entirely
adequately
recent
by
the
applicable
standards.
the
commission
made
clear
relying
on
this
court's
holding
in
the
texaco
case
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act
for
it
to
establish
as
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
royalties
are
rate
that
is
based
on
cost
based
on
the
intrastate
price,
the
unregulated
intrastate
price.
mr.
barnett
oh!
no,
no,
not
at
all,
the
commission
said
we
have
no
power
under
the
act
to
grant
it
or
we
decide
under
the
act
that
we
will
not
grant
it
if
the
higher
cost
you
are
talking
about
are
higher
cost
that
are
simply
based
on
the
unregulated
price
of
gas
which
the
commission
found
that
the
cost
here
were.
mr.
barnett
no,
no,
the
commission
took
it
into
consideration
here
and
decided
that
under
the
act
it
may
not
grant
a
higher
--
mr.
barnett
well,
the
commission
decided
here
that
it
have
no
power.
yes,
based
on
its
interpretation,
yes.
mr.
barnett
well,
yes
but
the
point
is
that
as
respondents
present
the
case
that's
simply
a
procedural
matter
and
the
commission
here
has
refused
even
to
consider
anything.
that
is
not
how
we
think
it
was.
the
commission
fully
considered
the
issue
and
decided
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
its
interpretation
of
the
act
that
the
grant
to
relief
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act.
it
did
consider
the
issue.
mr.
barnett
well,
that's
true
but
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
commission
never
said
it
lack
jurisdiction.
it
did
use
the
word
authority.
but
we
assert
that
saying
--
mr.
barnett
yes,
that
it
simply
a
legal
decision.
there
is
no
different
effect
between
it
saying
it
lacks
authority
under
the
act
and
it
saying
as
we
interpret
the
act
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act
for
us
to
do
this.
mr.
barnett
always
in
this
case?
mr.
barnett
well,
this
was
the
first
case
presented
to
it
that
presented
this
issue,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
barnett
about
a
--
about
a
royalty
based
on
market
value
royalty
which
was
interpreted
to
refer
to
the
unregulated
intrastate
market.
mr.
barnett
oh!
i'm
sorry.
are
you
referring
to
el
paso
and
kimberlin?
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
earlier
cases?
mr.
barnett
yes.
well,
they
are
distinguishable.
the
el
paso
case
involves
a
pipeline
as
distinguished
from
an
independent
producer
--
mr.
barnett
well,
it's
the
same
section
except
that
the
section
that
provides
section
2.66
of
the
commission's
regulations
does
provide
as
pennzoil
states
that
pipelines
as
well
as
independent
producers
are
subject
to
the
applicable
ceiling
price.
however,
in
fact,
el
paso
was
granted
an
exception
from
the
provision
in
the
very
el
paso
case.
and
under
that
exception,
el
paso's
rates
were
established
on
a
strict
cost
of
service
basis.
that
is
established
individually
for
el
paso
so
it
was
not
a
question
of
special
relief
from
an
otherwise
applicable
rate.
now
in
the
columbia
case
which
is
also
cited.
that
was
a
case
involved
that
where
a
pipeline
made
some
purchases
of
gas
which
were
held
to
be
none
--
which
had
previously
been
held
to
be
non-jurisdictional
purchases,
that
is
the
sale
of
the
gas
to
the
pipeline
was
not
regulated
by
the
commission.
and
the
question
was
whether
the
price
that
the
pipeline
paid
in
an
unregulated
purchase
could
be
included
in
the
pipeline's
rate
and
the
commission
held
that
it
could.
well,
apart
from
the
fact
that
--
mr.
barnett
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
barnett
well,
i
think
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
that
is
a
special
case
involving
jurisdictional
purchases
of
gas
to
how
else
are
you
going
to
treat
that?
mr.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
non-jurisdictional
purchase.
mr.
barnett
that's
right,
the
royalties
are
non-jurisdictional
too.
we
think
--
mr.
barnett
well,
we
think
the
commission
was
justified
and
thinking
that
there
is
a
difference
because
if
you
allow
the
past
through
of
non-jurisdictional
market
value
royalty
rates,
market
value
royalties
being
so
common.
you
are
going
to
completely
undermine
the
regulated
rates
for
the
sales
that
the
producers
make.
whereas
to
do
it
in
an
individual
case
like
columbia,
those
non-jurisdictional
purchases
which
do
not
underlie
a
whole
--
mr.
barnett
you're
still
construing
the
same
statute
but
the
commission
could
make
the
decision
that
if
it
granted
a
relief
and
the
market
value
royalty
cases,
it
would
be
undermining
the
entire
regulatory
scheme
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
texaco
which
was
another
case
where
a
whole
regulatory
scheme
would
be
undermined
and
there
is
no
such
effect
in
an
individual
case
of
non-jurisdictional
purchases
such
as
columbia.
mr.
barnett
the
commission
did
not
address
itself
to
the
administrative
law
judge's
holding
that
this
case
turned
--
mr.
barnett
the
administrative
law
judge
really
address
the
question
the
commission
addressed
either.
he
simply
said,
the
threshold
for
such
relief
is,
can
you
show
that
you're
operating
at
a
loss
and
this
had
not
been
shown.
the
commission
didn't
look
at
that
question,
it's
--
mr.
barnett
well,
it
said
that
under
the
act
it
would
be
illegal
for
us
to
grant
relief
in
this
case.
the
commission
did
not
however
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
commission's
holding
is
not
applicable
to
a
case
where
that
kind
of
a
showing
was
made.
if
the
producer
did
show
that
their
costs
exceeded
their
revenues,
so
that
they
had
made
a
case
for
confiscation,
the
commission
has
not
addressed
that
issue.
the
commission's
decision
--
mr.
barnett
well,
yes
it
might
be.
the
commission
here
does
not
interpret
the
act
to
require
or
to
do
something
unconstitutional
which
it
would
be
to
impose
a
confiscatory
rate.
and
thus
again,
the
commission's
decision
is
an
interpretation
of
the
act
as
applied
to
market
value
royalties
based
on
the
unregulated
market
in
a
situation
that
does
not
present
a
case
of
confiscation.
now
the
reason
the
commission
interpreted
the
act
this
way
was
largely
this
court's
decision
in
texaco
where
the
court
made
quite
clear
as
it
said
that
the
prevailing
price
in
the
marketplace
cannot
be
the
final
measure
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
mandated
by
the
act.
and
if
further
pointed
out
there
that
while
the
commission
had
said
that
the
rates
would
be
subject
to
refund
if
they
were
unreasonable,
reasonableness
was
apparently
to
be
judged
by
the
standard
of
the
marketplace.
now,
there
are
one
or
two
factual
differences
between
this
case
and
texaco
which
i
assume
my
colleagues
will
point
out
and
which
i
would
therefore
like
to
address.
it
is
--
there
are
two
what
i
would
call
quantitative
differences
only.
it
is
true
that
in
texaco,
it
was
the
entire
rates
of
the
small
producers
whose
reasonableness
was
to
be
judged
by
the
standard
of
the
marketplace
whereas
here
the
royalties
are
only
a
fraction
of
the
market
price,
one-fourth
or
one-eighth
here
as
against
the
entire
market
price
in
texaco.
another
quantitative
difference
is
that
here
again
you
would
--
here,
that
in
texaco,
again,
you
are
talking
about
the
entire
price
charged
by
the
small
producers
whereas
here
the
royalty
increment
is
only
a
portion
of
the
price
that
the
producers
would
be
charging
the
pipelines.
we
submit
that
neither
of
these
quantitative
differences
changes
the
applicable
principle.
the
second
difference
can
be
readily
dismissed
as
a
matter
of
law
because
the
incremental
royalty
here,
even
though
it's
only
an
increment.
even
though
it
would
only
be
a
part
of
the
price
that
producer's
charge
the
pipeline,
was
the
entire
rate
that
the
producers
are
asking
the
commission
to
approve
as
just
and
reasonable.
it
was
the
entire
incremental
royalty
that
had
to
be
shown
to
be
just
and
reasonable
and
thus
the
commission's
refusal
to
find
it
just
and
reasonable
and
the
commission
exactly
said
as
much
that
it
had
to
find
the
entire
incremental
royalty
to
be
just
and
reasonable
is
completely
consistent
with
texaco.
now,
the
other
difference,
one-fourth
and
one-eighth
versus
the
whole
thing
is
again
clearly
not
a
difference
in
principle.
the
court
said
as
much
in
texaco
417
u.s.
at
399
where
it
said
“even
if
the
effect
of
increased
small
producer
prices
would
make
a
small
dent
in
the
consumer's
pocket
when
compared
with
the
rates
charged
by
large
producers,
the
act
makes
unlawful
all
rates
which
are
not
just
and
reasonable
and
does
not
say
a
little
unlawful
--
a
little
unlawfulness
is
permitted.”
thus,
it's
true
of
the
incremental
rate
that
the
producer's
wanted
pass
through
here
just
as
it
was
true
of
the
rate
in
texaco
that
it
would
be
just
exclusively
by
the
market
price
and
thus,
we
submit
the
commission
was
entirely
justified
in
relying
on
texaco
for
its
conclusion
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act
to
allow
the
pass
through
as
just
and
reasonable
rates
of
royalties
based
on
the
unregulated
market.
another
reason
for
the
commission's
decision
is
pointed
out
by
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below.
the
decision
that
we
asked
the
court
to
reversed.
respondents
attempt
to
address
that
decision
in
sheik's
clothing
and
argue
that
it's
simply
a
procedural
issue
that's
at
stake
here
seizing
on
the
commission's
language
about
authority
and
thus
for
example,
if
shell
says
in
its
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
require
the
commission
of
fine
for
the
producer.
the
commission
was
merely
required
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
producer's
position.
well,
that
sounds
fine.
the
short
answer
first
is
that
the
commission
here
did
consider
the
merits
of
the
producer's
position.
it
did
consider
whether
it
should
grant
the
producers
the
relief
they
seek.
and
it
decided
not
to,
it
decided
that
it
would
not
do
so,
it
could
not
do
so
because
to
do
so
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
texaco.
but
further,
the
fact
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
clearly
would
require
the
commission
to
grant
relief
and
not
simply
to
consider
doing
so.
the
--
for
example
the
court
of
appeals
said,
this
is
page
7
(a)
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
this
is
not
to
say
that
every
additional
cost
must
be
past
through
to
the
customer
to
protect
the
producer's
level
of
profits.
the
commission
has
authority
to
consider
the
reasonableness
of
any
cost
incurred.
but
the
kicker
is
under
that
ad
hoc
reasonableness
standard.
the
commission
would
be
required
to
find
the
cost
to
be
reasonable
in
any
case
of
a
market
value
royalty
that
was
held
to
apply
to
the
intrastate
market.
shell
and
pennzoil
when
they
depart
momentarily
from
their
minimalist
portrait
of
the
decision
below,
admit
as
much,
they
argued
that
the
commission
would
be
required
to
grant
them
relief
for
several
reasons.
that
these
leases
were
entered
into
before
the
natural
gas
act
or
before
phillips
that
the
royalty
provisions
were
consistent
with
the
industry
standard
at
that
time
and
that
the
price
increase
would
generate
no
profits
since
it
would
simply
be
pass
through.
well,
that
would
be
true
generically,
typically
of
market
value
leases
in
any
state
where
such
leases
had
been
held
or
might
be
held
to
refer
or
the
intrastate
market.
thus,
if
all
the
commission
could
consider
was
whether
a
particular
royalty
had
been
entered
into
reasonably,
it
would
have
to
find
that
it
was.
and
that's
what
at
stake
here
is
not
simply
a
procedural
issue
but
whether
the
commission
must
grant
relief
on
a
generic
basis
for
such
market
value
royalties
and
the
commission
held
consistently
with
texaco
that
it
may
not
do
so.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
barnett
sure.
mr.
barnett
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
blackmun
we
filed
that
in
typescript
with
the
permission
of
the
clerk
last
wednesday.
we
did
have
a
printing
problem
--
mr.
barnett
well,
we
don't'
think
--
mr.
barnett
well,
we
don't
try
to
downplay
it.
we
–
that
is
the
commission's
view
of
the
impact
of
the
act.
the
act
has
considerable
impact
in
many
ways.
however,
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
the
ceiling
price
for
--
the
ceiling
price
provided
by
the
new
act
for
gas
that
was
already
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
under
the
old
act
would
remain
the
ceiling
price
that
had
been
set
by
the
commission
as
adjusted
for
inflation
or
that
had
been
increased
by
the
commission
under
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
of
the
new
act.
thus,
the
prices
applicable
to
this
gas
under
the
new
act
are
based
on
the
prices
applicable
under
the
old
act
and
that
in
very
brief
is
why
we
think
the
issue
is
still
alive
and
needs
decision
although
admittedly
in
the
future
as
the
two
markets
converge
the
practical
significance
of
the
issue
may
be
expected
to
decrease.
thank
you.
mr.
barnett
just
a
couple
of
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
with
respect
to
the
mobil
case
which
my
brothers
rely
on.
the
court
said
there
that
mobil's
argument
is
hypothetical
at
this
stage
and
that
in
any
event
and
effective
producer
is
entitled
to
seek
individualize
relief.
the
court
went
on
to
quote
the
d.c.
circuit
which
said,
if
there
are
subsequent
events
developed.
the
producers
are
put
in
a
bind
by
their
royalty
obligations,
they
may
certainly
petition
fpc
for
individualize
relief.
permian
contemplated
it
and
of
this
court's
quote.
well,
we
would
say
first
of
all
that
producers
here
were
entitled
to
seek
individualize
relief.
they
did
seek
it
and
the
commission
decided
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
act
to
grant
it.
further,
we
were
denied
that
the
producers
here
have
been
put
in
a
bind
in
the
terms
of
the
mobil
decision.
the
court
went
on
to
say
permian
contemplated
it.
well,
what
did
permian
contemplate?
if
one
looks
at
the
relevant
language
in
the
permian
decision,
390
u.s.
at
770,
the
court
there
said
the
commission
declared
that
our
producer
should
be
permitted
appropriate
relief
if
it
establishes
that
it's
out
of
pocket
expenses
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
a
particular
well
exceed
its
revenue
from
the
well
under
the
applicable
area
price.
the
commission
acknowledged
that
there
might
be
other
circumstances
in
which
relief
would
be
given
but
decline
to
enumerate
them.
mr.
barnett
yes,
we
would
interpret
it
that
way
and
we
would
rely
on
the
reference
to
permian
which
did
precisely
interpret
the
relief
provision
that
way.
to
respond
to
the
point
about
whether
the
commission
here
did
in
fact
rely
on
the
fact
that
these
proposed
incremental
royalties
were
based
on
the
intrastate
rate,
we
submit
that
that's
clear.
at
page
8261
of
the
appendix,
the
commission
said
in
the
instant
proceeding,
the
impetus
of
the
settlement
is
the
market
value
of
the
royalties
and
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
regulated
rates.
on
rehearing
8290,
the
commission
said,
i'm
sorry,
291
to
292,
“it
is
plain
that
the
royalty
has
to
be
based
on
78
cents
which
is
the
settlement's
reflection
of
market
prices
that
are
above
the
area
ceiling
prices.”
the
court
of
appeals
petition
appendix
3
(a)
stated
that
in
the
louisiana
state
court,
a
lessor
asserted
royalty
claim
based
on
intrastate
prices
for
natural
gas
which
greatly
exceed
the
ceiling
rates
to
establish
by
the
fpc
for
interstate
sales.
similar
statements
can
be
found
in
the
appendix
and
the
initial
decision
at
(a)
116
--
mr.
barnett
the
record
does
not
disclose
what
the
connection
was
mr.
justice.
mr.
barnett
the
alternative
to
the
78
cents
--
oh!
yes,
the
--
mr.
barnett
the
--
mr.
barnett
the
78
cents
was
in
fact
a
150%
of
the
regulated
rate
for
small
producers.
mr.
barnett
well,
--
mr.
barnett
well,
it
may
well
have
if
the
unregulated
price
was
about
--
the
claim
was
about
140
or
150
or
78
cents
may
well
have
been
thought
to
be
about
half
of
it.
but
the
short
answer
is
--
mr.
barnett
yes,
but
--
mr.
barnett
well,
so
my
colleague
says
but
we
would
submit
--
mr.
barnett
i
haven't
seen
it,
i
certainly
wouldn't
challenge
it.
mr.
barnett
well,
there's
less
–
yes,
for
example,
855
testimony
of
mr.
smith
for
united
gas
pipeline
company,
who
says
the
78
cents
price
is
very
--
which
i
feel
is
very
reasonable
in
light
of
today's
market
prices.
856,
we
are
prepared
to
show
what
the
latest
arm's-length
intrastate
prices
are
in
this
area
of
south
louisiana
and
it
will
show
and
i
read
this
numbers,
the
very
reasonable
price
level
of
78
cents
for
the
settlement.
but
a
part
from
all
that
--
mr.
barnett
yes.
but
apart
from
all
that,
we
would
say
the
computation,
the
mode
of
computation
is
irrelevant.
it's
clear
that
the
suit
was
for
market
value
royalties
based
on
the
intrastate
rate
price.
the
settlement
is
to
get
rid
of
the
suit.
the
means
of
computation
that
has
no
legal
impact
we
would
say.
thank
you
very
much.
