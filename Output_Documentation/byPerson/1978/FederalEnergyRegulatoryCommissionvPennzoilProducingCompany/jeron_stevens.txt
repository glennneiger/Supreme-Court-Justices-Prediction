mr.
jeron
stevens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
say
that
i've
been
increasingly
intrigued
as
this
case
has
developed
on
its
way
from
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
particularly
in
the
position
that
the
commission's
been
taking.
i
didn't
prepare
these
remarks
to
begin
this
way
but
let
me
take
a
few
minutes
of
my
time
and
tell
you
why
i'm
so
intrigued.
that
is
the
commission
in
its
opinion
and
the
opinion
on
the
case
below
said,
“we
cannot
permit
any
incremental
royalty
costs
resulting
from
this
settlement
or
resulting
from
any
judgment
by
state
court
regarding
royalty
payments
to
be
based
on
--
to
be
passed
on
to
the
pipeline
if
these
incremental
royalty
costs
were
based
on
any
further
factors
than
the
regulated
just
and
reasonable
right.
they
did
not
say,
we
cannot
permit
any
right
based
on
intrastate
rates
to
be
passed
on.
they
said
any
factor
other
than
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
and
of
course
there
are
number
of
other
factors
that
should
be
involved
in
any
case
like
this
and
they're
involved
in
the
case
below
that
we
had
witnesses
valid
and
all
that.
the
interesting
thing
about
this
is
the
commission
decided
it
had
no
authority.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
fifth
circuit
as
a
question
of
authority.
mr.
jeron
stevens
jurisdiction,
if
you
will
your
honor.
mr.
jeron
stevens
i
agree
and
that's
why
we
--
mr.
jeron
stevens
no,
sir.
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
mr.
jeron
stevens
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeron
stevens
that's
the
word
i
would
use.
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
the
interesting
thing
about
it
though
is,
that
as
the
record
below
shows
the
settlement
in
this
case,
it
was
a
settlement
of
royalty
litigation
under
market
value
lease.
the
settlement
had
the
royalty
to
either
78
cents
or
150%
of
the
national
rate.
at
the
time
the
settlement
was
executed,
the
commission
had
before
it
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding,
the
proposal
to
permit
small
producers
to
collect
150%
of
the
national
right.
this
settlement
was
tied
exactly
to
that.
at
that
time
the
national
rate
as
reflected
in
the
record
below
is
52
cents
per
mcf
and
78
cents
is
exactly
150%
of
that.
this
settlement
was
tied
directly
to
commission
set
rates
and
not
to
intrastate
rates.
unfortunately,
the
only
direct
testimony
in
this
point
was
produced
by
pennzoil's
witness
gray,
which
is
found
at
page
36
of
the
transcript
in
this
case
which
because
why
the
case's
brief
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
of
course
it
is
viable
to
the
ourt,
if
the
court
wish
we
would
file
that
as
a
supplemental
appendix.
those
are
the
facts
of
how
that
case
got
to
the
fifth
circuit.
now,
we've
been
seeing
this
evolving
argument
and
it
comes
out
very
expressly
for
the
first
time
at
page
12
of
the
reply
brief
that
was
filed
last
wednesday.
when
the
commission
finally
makes
the
assertion
that
the
commission
based
its
decision,
and
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i'm
talking
about
the
typewritten
copy
and
not
the
printed
copy.
mr.
jeron
stevens
that
is
that
the
commission
based
its
holding
on
the
record
to
the
effect
that
this
settlement
royalty
was
based
on
intrastate
rates.
that
is
just
not
the
fact.
if
that
is
now
the
argument
that
the
commission
is
relying
on,
then
i
suggest
that
they
have
a
serious
problem
under
section
19
(b)
of
the
act
because
that
would
be
a
factual
finding.
and
as
i
read
section
19
(b)
of
the
gas
act,
it
requires
all
factual
findings
to
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
there
is
not
only
no
substantial
evidence,
there
is
no
evidence.
mr.
jeron
stevens
yes,
sir.
i
suggest
exactly.
mr.
jeron
stevens
yes,
sir.
i'm
suggesting
exactly
that.
mr.
jeron
stevens
your
honor?
mr.
jeron
stevens
well,
your
honor,
i'm
certainly
aware
that
this
court
has
held
that
it
would
be
improper
to
--
in
the
burlington
trucking
line
--
trucking
case
to
affirm
lower
a
commission
decision
based
on
post
talk
rationalization.
and
yes
sir,
i'm
suggesting
if
that's
the
basis
of
the
primary
thrust
of
their
argument
at
this
point
that
the
court
cannot
and
should
not
affirm
it
on
that
basis.
now,
if
the
court
wishes
to
affirm
it
on
the
question
of
authority,
which
is
what
we
briefed
in
the
fifth
circuit
argued
there
and
i
thought
we
were
arguing
here,
then
of
course,
the
court
is
free
to
do
that
because
the
commission
did
address
that
issue
also.
and
i
will
suggest
that
the
basic
reason
that
the
commission
has
reached
the
position
that's
it's
in,
in
this
case,
is
because
it
did
read
texaco
but
it
misread
it.
we
read
texaco
as
being
the
case
basically
where
the
commission
was
attempting
to
deregulate
small
producer
rates
by
tying
them
directly
and
solely
to
intrastate
process.
we
read
texaco
as
holding
that
the
commission
cannot
deregulate
something
over
which
it
has
the
right
jurisdiction.
but
that
if
the
commission
wishes
to
regulate
indirectly,
it
must
consider
all
factors
and
not
solely
intrastate
price
levels.
we're
not
asking
permission
in
our
case
to
deregulate
anything.
as
mr.
barnett
candidly
admitted,
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
royalty
cost.
they
do
that
jurisdiction
over
our
entire
right.
now,
we
brought
forth
a
request
for
inquiries
on
that
regulated
right.
and
we
ask
them
to
consider
all
the
relevant
factors
and
there
were
several
put
out
in
the
testimony
and
case
below
at
the
hearing
before
--
mr.
jeron
stevens
your
honor,
certainly,
we
agree
that
the
impetus
of
the
litigation
and
the
impetus
of
the
settlement
and
the
impetus
of
our
application
for
relief
was
the
litigation
that
was
requesting
market
value
be
based
on
intrastate
or
other
process.
simply
because
that
is
what
that
cause
this
whole
thing
to
get
going.
it
doesn't
mean
that
that's
what
the
settlement
was
based
on.
we
view
their
holding
as
set
out
on
page
261
of
the
joint
appendix
and
the
second
sentence,
the
one
i
quoted
earlier
as
saying
they
have
no
authority.
and
that
certainly
laid
the
commission
brief
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
that's
the
way
we
briefed
it.
i
would
suggest
that
since
we're
not
asking
the
commission
to
based
any
component
of
our
right
on
intrastate
rights
solely,
even
assuming
that
our
process
were
based
in
part
on
intrastate
rights,
we
can't
see
how
as
a
matter
of
logic
the
answer
of
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
has
authority
should
be
any
different.
though
we
think
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
do
the
same
thing
it
did
in
texaco
and
that
is
to
focus
solely
on
one
comparison
that
is
the
comparison
of
the
settlement
right
here
with
intrastate
process
and
then
to
say,
“we're
sorry
pennzoil,
we're
sympathetic
to
your
plot
but
texaco
tells
us
that
we
can't
focus
solely
on
this
comparison
and
grant
your
rate
increase.”
pennzoil
believes
that
our
argument
is
consistent,
our
reading
of
texaco,
pardon
me,
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
with
this
court's
previous
decisions
and
with
the
commission's
previous
representations
to
the
court.
and
i'm
talking
specifically
here
about
the
mobil
case
in
review
of
the
southern
louisiana
area
rate
case.
in
the
commission's
brief
in
that
case,
they
specifically
told
the
court
that
the
producers
in
a
market
value
royalty
bond
could
petition
for
individualize
relief.
we
believe
that
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
commission
was
affirmed
in
setting
area
rights
on
that
point.
mr.
jeron
stevens
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
jeron
stevens
yes,
sir.
there
--
mr.
jeron
stevens
yes,
sir.
there,
your
honor,
the
item
in
question
that
was
being
priced
was
not
an
item
over
the
--
for
which
the
commission
had
direct
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeron
stevens
and
they
did
over
the
small
producers
in
texaco.
the
commission
look
at
the
merits
as
i
understand
it
in
the
columbia
case
of
the
process
--
mr.
jeron
stevens
that's
right.
your
honor,
our
view,
the
columbia
case,
the
texaco
case,
and
pennzoil's
position
on
this
case
is
being
entirely
consistent.
and
the
columbia
case
what
the
commission
did
basically
was
to
look
at
those
costs
that
were
being
included
those
purchase
costs
that
were
being
included
in
the
pipeline's
flow
through
and
their
rights.
and
so
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
those.
we
can't
automatically
exclude
them
because
solely
because
they're
equal
to
or
based
upon
or
tied
to
or
related
to
in
some
way
market
value
cost
though
we
do
have
the
authority
to
review
them
on
the
merits
and
determine
whether
or
not
they
make
statutory
section
for
just
and
unreasonable
test.
and
that's
what
we're
here
claiming
the
commission
has
authority
to
do
in
our
case.
i
think
this
is
also
consistent
with
el
paso
case
which
you
asked
about
earlier.
in
the
el
paso
case,
the
commission
in
fact
granted
the
flow
through
and
the
jurisdictional
right
of
a
royalty
component
that's
virtually
identical
to
the
one
that
pennzoil
is
asking
for
the
flow
through,
your
honor,
virtually
identical
to
it.
though,
they
tried
to
distinguish
that
in
their
brief
and
in
this
argument,
on
the
basis
that
that's
a
pipeline
and
their
cost
of
service
is
regulated
individually.
the
face
of
the
order
in
that
opinion
at
page
5
shows
that
they
in
fact
had
to
waive
the
national
rate
regulations
which
were
then
applicable
to
el
paso's
rights
in
order
to
grant
them
relief.
it
also
shows
the
25%
of
el
paso's
production
would
continue
with
price
that
the
applicable
national
rate
for
producers.
but
that's
not
really
the
point.
the
point
really
is
that
section
4,
the
natural
gas
act,
applies
equally
to
producers
on
the
pipelines.
and
if
they
have
the
authority
to
do
it
for
pipelines,
they
have
the
authority
to
do
for
producers.
now,
we're
not
here
arguing
and
we
didn't
argue
before
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
commission
is
compelled
to
regulate
producers
the
same
way
it
regulates
pipelines.
if
it
can
find
reasonable
reasons
for
distinguishing,
for
putting
one
method
of
regulation
for
pipelines
and
one
for
producers,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
assuming
they
can
support
that
on
some
reasonable
basis.
our
only
point
is
that
it's
the
same
statute
and
the
authority
basically
has
to
be
the
same.
and
i
characterize
the
question
of
authority
as
more
quite
frankly
than
merely
procedural.
i
believe
it
is
more
than
procedural.
the
national
--
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978,
of
course
we
have
not
filed
a
brief
on
that,
i
only
have
one
brief
comment
on
it,
and
that
is
that
under
section
502
(c)
of
that
statute,
it
appears
to
expressly
grant
the
commission,
the
authority
to
permit
rate
relief
to
any
individual
gas
producer.
notwithstanding
that
the
end
result
of
that
rate
would
no
longer
be
just
and
reasonable
under
the
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act.
we
are
not
arguing
that
as
a
basis
for
overturning
the
commission's
opinion
because
it
is
not
in
effect
at
that
time.
but
i
thought
it
would
be
pertinent
to
at
least
call
it
the
court's
attention.
mr.
jeron
stevens
no,
sir.
that
is
not
our
point.
we
believe
that
on
remand
on
the
merits,
we
will
be
able
to
show
that
our
request
is
just
and
reasonable
that
it
was
prudently
incurred
and
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
gas
consumers,
of
united
gas
pipeline
and
of
pennzoil
and
we'll
show
in
fact
and
did
show
in
fact
that
more
gas
will
be
produced
for
the
consumers
and
that's
why
united
has
been
supporting
this
case
all
the
way
along.
thank
you
very
much.
