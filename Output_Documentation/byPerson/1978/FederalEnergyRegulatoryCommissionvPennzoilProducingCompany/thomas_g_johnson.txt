mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
g.
johnson
representing
shell
oil
company.
i
would
like
to
address
first
the
question
or
the
basis
of
the
commission's
decision
which
i
believe
is
clear
from
the
face
of
the
opinion.
if
the
court
will
refer
to
page
27261
of
the
appendix,
the
commission
said
at
that
point
we
cannot
permit
any
incremental
royalty
cost
resulting
from
this
settlement
or
resulting
from
any
judgment
by
state
court
regarding
royalty
payments
to
be
passed
on
to
the
pipeline
if
this
incremental
royalty
costs
are
based
on
any
other
factors
than
the
regulated
just
and
reasonable
rate.
i
believe
the
commission
is
saying
and
reading
texaco
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
authority
to
grant
the
relief
requested
by
shell
and
pennzoil
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
previous
sentence
to
make
the
record
complete
says
that
an
impetus
of
the
settlement
is
the
market
value
of
the
royalties
and
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
regulated
rates.
and
that's
the
way
the
commission
reads
texaco.
if
confirmation
is
needed,
i
believe
it
appears
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
pages
6
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
commission
concluded
that
it
was
not
free
to
allow
royalty
costs
which
are
based
on
market
values
to
be
passed
on
to
the
pipelines
as
just
and
reasonable
rates.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
and
i
believe
what
it
says
is
that
the
commission
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
whether
the
increase
royalty
cost
would
result
in
a
ceiling
rate
being
imposed
on
shell
and
pennzoil
which
is
consistent
toward.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
the
administrative
law
judge
disagreed
with
our
position.
the
commission
did
not
reach
it.
with
reference
to,
another
issue
which
the
commission
did
not
decide
because
of
its
position
is
whether
the
increase
royalty
cost
was
prudently
and
reasonably
incurred.
this
was
specifically
reserved
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
commission
on
remake.
if
this
issues,
if
the
commission's
position
is
affirmed
here,
the
commission
will
never
reach
these
issues
because
it
contends
that
it
has
no
authority
to
decide
them.
i
would
now
like
to
discuss
the
reference
to
justice
blackmun's
question
about
the
natural
gas
policy
act
and
whether
congress
has
undermined
the
import
of
texaco.
we
believe
that
while
the
natural
gas
policy
act
fixes
different
categories,
price
categories
for
gas,
it
still
makes
a
difference
as
to
whether
the
gas
was
sold
on
the
intra
or
interstate
market.
that
as
far
as
the
rational
of
texaco
is
concerned
it
is
no
longer
material
because
the
ceiling
prices
set
up
prospectively
in
the
natural
gas
policy
act
apply
across
the
board
whether
the
sale
is
interstate
or
intrastate.
in
fact,
as
a
portion
of
that
act,
section
105
the
congress
specifically
approved
the
intrastate
contract
prices
for
past
periods
as
being
the
maximum
lawful
price
permitted
under
the
act.
we
therefore
believe
that
the
commission
in
this
court's
earlier
concern
about
the
unrated
regulated
market
is
no
longer
material
under
this
act.
as
mr.
stevens
pointed
out,
this
commission
has
itself
utilized
the
intrastate
prices
along
with
other
factors
in
determining
producer
rates
in
past
cases.
in
the
area
rate
proceedings,
specifically
the
other
southwest
area
rate
case,
the
commission
did
utilize
intrastate
prices
in
determining
the
producer
rates.
this
use
was
attacked
on
appeal
on
the
fifth
circuit
and
was
specifically
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
this
court
denied
certiorari.
in
the
first
national
rate
proceeding
on
this
gas,
shell
oil
company
v.
fpc
at
520
f.
2d,
the
issue
was
again
raised
in
the
national
rate
case.
the
commission
relied
on
intrastate
prices
as
one
of
the
factors
that
it
looked
at
in
determining
producer
raised.
it
was
again
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court,
this
court
again
denied
certiorari.
mr.
stevens
has
already
referred
to
the
pipeline
cases
which
we
believe
are
squarely
in
point
here.
the
commission
also
in
dealing
with
the
prices
on
emergency
sales
for
natural
gas,
and
limit
the
terms
sales,
by
producers
has
reference
to
comparable
prices
in
the
intrastate
market
in
determining
whether
these
sales
are
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
the
commission
collects
data
on
the
intrastate
market
on
form
45
and
quarterly
publishes
reports
of
that
data
which
it
utilizes
in
producer
rates.
we
therefore
do
no
believe
the
commission
acts
consistently
when
it
says
that
it
cannot
look
to
intrastate
prices
for
any
purpose.
we
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
we
believe
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
texaco
because
the
royalty
provides
only
one
of
the
cost
components
which
the
commission
looks
to
in
determining
producer
rates.
the
price
of
the
other
cost
components,
steel
pipe,
labor,
federal
income
taxes
is
not
subject
to
commission
regulation
either.
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
these
prices
are
used
as
determinates
in
the
commission
rate.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
a
quotation
which
appears
in
the
state
of
louisiana
brief
from
the
mississippi
river
fuel
case
decided
by
the
d.c.
circuit
because
it's
very
pertinent
here
“expenses
are
facts".
they
are
to
be
ascertained
not
created
by
regulatory
authorities.
if
properly
incurred
they
must
be
allowed
as
a
part
of
the
composition
of
the
rates,
otherwise,
the
so-called
allowance
on
the
return
of
investment
as
being
amount
over
and
above
expense
would
be
a
farce.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
justice
white,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
in
three
ways.
first
of
all,
your
question
accepted
the
question
of
confiscatory
rates.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
and
we
believe
that
is
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
which
the
commission
refused
to
consider.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
secondly,
in
the
permian
case,
part
of
the
reason
why
this
court
affirmed
the
area
rate
was
the
exception
which
the
commission
said
it
would
grant
in
special
cases
like
this
case.
and
thirdly,
in
the
mobil
case,
the
commission
expressly
was
faced
with
the
situation
here
and
asked
by
the
producers
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
rate
proceeding
and
the
southern
louisiana
area
rate
proceeding
which
became
the
mobil
case
in
this
court
to
allow
relief
or
this
very
problem,
the
market
value
roll
the
question
on
an
area
or
national
basis.
the
commission
refused
to
do
so.
and
in
saying
it
refused
to
do
so
on
a
national
or
an
area
rate
basis,
it
said
that
it
took
the
position
that
producers
could
bring
special
relief
cases
like
this
case
in
order
to
get
those
question
result.
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
affirmed
the
commission
on
that
basis
and
the
fifth
circuit's
language
if
i
could
just
quote
it
is
this,
“if
a
subsequent
advanced
developed
the
producers
are
put
in
a
bind
by
their
royalty
obligations,
they
may
certainly
petition
the
fpc
for
individualize
relief.
that
language
from
the
fifth
circuit
was
quoted
in
this
court's
opinion
in
mobil
with
approval.
now,
the
producers
are
here
before
this
court
asking
for
the
specific
kind
of
individualize
relief
which
this
court
indicated
in
mobil
it
would
grant.
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
again,
i
would
refer
to
the
permian
case
and
as
i
read
permian,
that
was
one
of
the
basis
that
this
court
utilize
in
affirming
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
think
it
would
be
contrary
the
act
if
the
commission
in
so
doing
imposed
a
confiscatory
rate.
and
the
purpose
of
the
exception,
specific
exception
for
individual
case
is
to
allow
the
commission
to
consider
this
question.
and
i
believe
other
cases
in
this
court
have
indicated
that
the
commission
cannot
impose
a
confiscatory
rate,
even
an
area
rate
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
what
we're
asking
for
in
this
case
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
--
is
the
precise
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
well,
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
i
think
if
i
could
restate
our
position.
i
think
what
we're
asking
is
this.
since
the
commission
expressly
refused
to
consider
this
problem
in
the
area
in
national
cases
and
told
this
court
that
this
was
the
kind
of
case
they
would
consider
that
we
believe
we're
entitled
to
that
kind
of
consideration.
now
the
commission
can
hold
against
us
on
the
merits.
and
if
this
court
affirms
the
court
of
appeals,
that
will
the
case
would
go
back
before
the
commission
on
remand
and
it
will
consider
the
merits
of
the
confiscation
question.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
commission
is
affirmed
this
question
will
never
be
considered
because
the
commission
will
have
been
found
without
authority
to
consider.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
would
not
be
satisfied.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
what
we
want
is
a
fair
trial
on
the
merits
and
that's
what
we're
asking.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes,
i
think
the
merits
also
go
to
the
question
if
whether
royalty
cost
is
reasonable
and
prudently
incurred.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
this
is
the
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
--
the
historic
test
which
the
commission
is
utilized
and
determined
why
the
costs
are
granted.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
that
is
correct.
and
as
i
understood
your
honor's
question
when
addressed
to
me
that
was
what
the
commission
would
be
required
under
the
law.
but
we
believe
they
should
also
consider
whether
or
not
these
costs
are
prudently
incurred.
if
i
could
turn
now
to
another
point,
the
end
result
test
is
the
test
which
this
court
has
historically
imposed
on
commission
decisions.
i
would
like
if
it
consider
for
this
court's
attention
just
for
a
moment,
the
end
result
on
the
parties
of
the
commission's
opinion
when
shell
got
in
this
bind
as
described
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
executing
its
lease
in
1934,
before
the
natural
gas
act
was
even
passed.
and
secondly,
lease
1952
was
executed
two
years
before
this
court's
phillips
decision
and
the
commission
was
not
regulating
producers.
it
wasn't
until
1965
in
the
permian
case
when
the
commission
decided
that
it
would
reject
the
individual
company
cost
of
service
as
the
method
of
regulation
of
producers
and
would
also
reject
the
market
value
studies,
economic
studies
or
market
value
and
would
rely
instead
on
the
composite
industry-wide
cost
of
service
which
incidentally
included
a
royalty
cost
of
12-1/2%.
it
was
not
until
hubert
and
valor
cases
were
decided
in
1966
and
1968
that
the
producers
suspected
that
the
lessor
would
be
entitled
to
describe
a
higher
price
to
their
royalty
percentage
and
the
lessee
was
permitted
to
charge
under
regulation.
it
was
not
until
the
mobil
case
decided
with
the
d.c.
circuit
in
1971
that
the
commission
was
held
not
to
have
the
authority
to
impose
the
same
ceiling
on
the
lessor.
when
the
producers
found
out
they
were
in
this
bind
to
ask
the
commission
for
relief
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
and
southern
louisiana
area
rate
cases,
the
commission
was
assured
that
if
we
came
back
in
an
individual
relief
case,
they
would
grant
relief
there.
this
is
that
case
in
the
commission
now
contends
they
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
this
relief.
if
i
could
turn
for
just
a
moment
to
the
abandonment
question,
here
again,
we
believe
the
commission
has
not
fully
considered
the
case
on
the
merits.
the
only
point
considered
by
the
commission
was
whether
that
if
shell's
leases
were
cancelled
and
the
lessor
became
the
owner
of
all
of
the
gas
and
the
leases.
it
would
be
required
to
continue
to
sell
that
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
of
course,
this
court
have
and
opinion
holds
that
the
lessor
would
be
so
required.
but
i
believe
the
commission's
duty
under
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
test
of
section
7
goes
further.
now,
we
believe
that
commission
must
consider
the
end-result
on
all
the
parties.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
lessee,
the
end
result
of
the
denial
of
the
abandonment
is
--
the
end
result
of
the
denial
of
the
abandonment
is
the
confiscation
of
the
lessee's
leases.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
lessor
and
the
standpoint
of
the
consumer,
the
consumer's
price
will
go
up
and
i'll
leave
that
discussion
to
my
brief.
thank
you,
your
honor.
