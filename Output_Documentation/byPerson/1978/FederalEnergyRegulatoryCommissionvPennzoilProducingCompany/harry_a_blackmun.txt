mr.
barnett,
before
you
sit
down.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
reply
brief
filed
yesterday
which
is
at
my
desk
just
this
morning.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
not
being
critical,
i
knew
they
would
like
to
have
you
make
one
or
two
sentence
comment
on
the
effect
of
the
78
act
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
new
act
makes
the
underlying
rational
of
texaco
almost
inapplicable
from
here
on
end.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
was
just
trying
to
downplay
it
in
your
brief
but
maybe
i
should
ask
this
question
in
closing
counsel
but
at
least
i'd
like
some
comment
from
you.
