justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
that
the
commission
decided
that
it
would
violate
the
act
for
them
to
grant
relief
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
position
the
commission
took
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
commission
adequately
states
the
reasons
for
its
decision
in
its
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
ordinary
administrative
practices
of
explaining
clearly
enough
what
the
grounds
for
the
decision
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
someone
comes
in
and
just
says,
i'm
now
having
to
pay
more
for
my
gas
than
i
used
to
and
i
want
a
rate
adjustment.
and
the
commission
says,
we
have
no
power
under
the
act
to
grant
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
they
have
no
power
to
grant
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
about
an
independent
producer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that's
an
ambiguous
term
too,
i
supposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
no
word
about
jurisdiction
in
this
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
isn't
in
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
refer
to
it
as
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
could
sensibly
call
it
a
matter
of
authority
if
the
question
was,
is
it
legal
under
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
to
do
what
the
commission
was
asked
to
do
was
illegal
under
the
act
you
could
say
that
they
had
no
authority
to
grant
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
itself
found
that
the,
i
think
that
this
is
an
accurate
quote
that
the
commission
found
that
the
impetus
of
the
settlement
is
the
market
value
of
the
royalties
and
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
regulative
rates.
so
the
commission
equated
this
request
with
an
intrastate
unregulated
market
request.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
columbia
cases
consistent
with
texaco?
i
know
that
one
is
a
pipeline
and
the
other
isn't
connected.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
there
the
request
was
based
on
an
unregulated
rate
or
unregulated
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
market
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
have
any
--
they
didn't
have
any
jurisdiction
over
the
prices
that
were
being
charged
in
unregulated
market.
just
like
they
didn't
have
any
--
they
don't
any
jurisdiction
over
the
royalty
charges
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
the
commission
has
required
to
grant
you,
your
client
the
relief
you
asked?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
sentence
starts
out
as
such.
and
i
suppose
that
refers
to
the
previous
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
still
the
very
language
of
the
commission
used
in
the
same
paragraph.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
sir.
suppose
the
commission
had
talked
about
authority
or
what
the
statute
required
also
rights.
what
you
just
said
that
we've
been
setting
area
rates
and
our
rule
is
and
we
think
it's
consistent
with
the
statute.
our
rule
is
we'll
change
an
area
rate
to
just
base
on
some
single
cost
factor.
or
at
least
we
will
grant
no
exceptions
from
an
area
rate
that
we've
set
for
an
individual
producer.
unless
he
shows
that
there's
some
confiscatory
element
in
the
picture.
we
might
have
authority
to
have
a
different
rule
but
this
is
our
rule.
we're
just
not
going
to
grant
any
individual
exceptions
to
an
area
rate.
if
royalties
go
up
or
something
like
that,
maybe
we
will
set
a
new
area
rates
sometime.
but
until
somebody
is
being
put
into
business,
we're
not
granting
any
exceptions,
would
that
be
in
consistent
with
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
was,
would
it
be
contrary
to
the
act
for
the
commission
to
have
the
rule
that
i
posited
and
you
said,
up
to
now
it
hasn't,
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
that
rule
that's
all
you
said
so
far.
but
is
it
your
position
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
act
if
the
commission
said
we're
just
not
going
to
grant
any
exceptions.
we'll
unless
there's
some
kind
of
confiscatory
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
position
is
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
be
satisfied
in
this
case
if
the
commission
said
that
we'll
grant
you
relief
when
and
if
you
show
that
it
is
confiscatory?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
all
you're
asking.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
all
you're
asking.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
asking
them
to
--
in
any
event
that
they
must
or
at
least
they
got
the
authority
to
re-determine
the
just
and
reasonableness
of
a
rate
base
on
new
royalty
cost
in
any
case
whether
it's
confiscatory
or
not.
isn't
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
be
satisfied
then
if
the
only
thing
that
were
left
open
on
remand
is
whether
or
not
the
result
would
be
confiscation
if
your
request
is
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wanted
more
than
that,
i
would
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
merits
are
more
than
just
the
question
of
confiscation?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
confiscation
item
that
you
want.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
others
wouldn't
hurt?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
into
what
extent
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
has
authority
to
grant
special
rate
relief
to
natural
gas
producers
who's
royalty
cost
have
escalated
they
are
tied
to
the
price
of
natural
gas
in
unregulated
market,
the
intrastate
market.
the
commission
in
its
initial
opinion
seemed
to
indicate
that
it
was
without
authority
to
grant
such
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
disagreed
and
strongly
indicated
that
the
commission
should
grant
such
relief
if
it
was
necessary
to
maintain
the
profit
margins
of
the
producers.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
have
filed
an
opinion
that
does
not
exactly
agree
with
either
of
the
commission
or
the
court
of
appeals.
if
the
commission
is
to
be
read
in
its
opinion
as
indicating
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
such
relief,
we
think
it
was
clearly
and
error
and
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
respect.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
confine
far
too
narrowly
the
discretion
of
the
commission
when
such
rate
relief
is
at
issue
and
particularly
we
do
not
belief
the
standard
is
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
announced.
we
do
think
the
--
however
that
the
entire
case
should
be
returned
to
the
commission
so
that
the
commission
may
dispose
of
the
case
under
the
right
standards.
and
this
remand
of
the
commission
carries
with
it
also
a
related
issue
about
abandonment
on
which
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
also
erred.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
vacated
and
that
court
is
directed
to
return
the
case
to
the
commission.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
