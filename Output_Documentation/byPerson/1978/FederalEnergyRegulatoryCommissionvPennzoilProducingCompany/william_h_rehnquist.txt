justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnett,
did
they
actually
take
the
position
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
pretty
much
the
same
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
decided
that
it
simply
could
not
consider
this
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
see
i
considered
the
case
but
it
could
not
consider
this
particular
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
simply
a
factor
which
the
commission
will
not
take
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
a
higher
rate
should
be
granted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
have
no
power
to
grant
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
all
i
asked
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
had
two
or
three
cases
here
in
the
short
time
i've
been
on
the
court
coming
from
the
predecessor
of
the
ferc
where
the
commission
started
out
taking
the
position.
we
simply
have
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
this.
and
by
the
time
it
gets
here,
it
turns
out
they
have
jurisdiction
by
they
could
easily
decided
at
the
way
they
did
on
the
basis
--
in
administrative
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
just
a
legal
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
has
the
commission
always
taken
this
position
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
in
other
cases,
similar
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
cases
that
depends
--
refers
to
the
pipeline
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
was.
but
now
i'm
asking
you
about
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
same
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
was
an
individual
case.
it
already
been
a
ceiling
price
establish
in
columbia,
hadn't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
non-jurisdictional
purchase.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
is
non-jurisdiction
here
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what's
the
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
still
construing
the
same
section
of
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
i
take
it
that
the
commission
didn't
agree
with
the
administrative
law
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
the
administrative
law
judge
sought
that
the
commission
had
legal
power
under
the
statute
that
the
commission
said
it
didn't
have.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
said
--
it
said,
we
can't
get
there?
that's
it.
it's
illegal
for
us
to
get
to
that
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
they
would
--
then
suddenly,
it
would
be
legal
to
recognize
the
extra
royalty
cost
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
argument
made
by
the
plaintiff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
do
you
suggest
that
what
the
government
argues
here
in
its
reply
brief
or
elsewhere
does
not
agree
with
what
the
commission
itself
found
in
its
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you're
saying
that
they
want
affirmance
on
the
ground
different
from
what?
