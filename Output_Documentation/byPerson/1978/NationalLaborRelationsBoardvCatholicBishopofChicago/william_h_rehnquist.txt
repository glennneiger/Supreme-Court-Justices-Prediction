justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
you
apparently
feel
that
the
statutory
issue
is
clear,
simply
because
of
the
general
language
and
yet,
an
exception
was
found
in
mcculloch
versus
sociedad,
where
the
general
language
was
equally
clear.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
it
just
as
permissible
in
inference
in
the
light
of
the
reasoning
in
mcculloch
to
say
that
assertion
of
congressional
jurisdiction
over
a
parochial
school
and
the
bishop
of
chicago,
where
they
require
an
expressed
statement
because
of
a
possible
first
amendment
implication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
board
be
bound
by
the
bishop's
determination
as
to
the
issue
of
heresy
in
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
doesn't
every
church
function
as
an
employer
in
a
sense
when
they
hire
a
pastor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
have
a
hard
time
getting
one
with
one,
wouldn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
all
clergy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
state
safety
regulations,
fire
regulations,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
i
take
it
that
you
concede
the
state
may
apply
those.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
that
extent,
the
bishop
isn't
the
absolute
authority
over
the
school?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
there
constant
litigation
over
the
nlrb's
assumption
of
jurisdiction
here
when
there
is
an
over,
say
zoning
of
churches
or
is
there
a
constant
litigation
over
zoning
of
churches?
