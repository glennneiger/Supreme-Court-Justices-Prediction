mr.
solicitor
general
this
case
only
involves
layman,
and
only
problems
involved
are
working
conditions,
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
to
the
state
regulations.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
state
can
also
take
away
their
accreditation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
school
cannot
operate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
accreditation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
compulsory
attendance
law
in
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
to
be
subject
to
that
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
bishop
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
labor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
bishop
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction
over
the
labor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
whole
point
was
that
the
bishop
was
the
boss.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
your
whole
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
that,
but
why
is
he
subject
to
the
nlrb
and
the
teacher
is
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
could,
and
i
know
you
can,
name
me
one
non-catholic
janitor
in
chicago
public
catholic
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
we
need
to
get
the
janitors
(voice
overlap).
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
want
to
put
it
to
any,
it
is
all
right
with
me,
but
don't
count
me
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rueben
isn't
it
true
as
the
fact
that
most
law
in
cities
that
they
don't
write
or
heard
on
the
parochial
school,
they've
been
running
a
year,
they
just
let
them
go?
i
don't
think
it
matters
in
this
case
at
all,
but
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
do
supervise?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
they
do,
but
i
mean
did
the
fire
commission
walk
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
want,
now
where
does
the
parent
go,
they
go
to
the
bishop?
