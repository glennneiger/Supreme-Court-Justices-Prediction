justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
you
support
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that
was
my
next
question,
because
i
gathered
a
lukewarmness
in
your
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
does
this
not
involve
the
board
in
the
determination
what
is
completely
religious
versus
what
is
merely
religiously
associated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
it
does,
doesn't
that
get
beyond
the
limit
constitutionally
over?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
or
not,
whether
is
or
not
it
has
applied
it,
it
may
involve
the
board
in
examining
in
the
religious
principles
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
would
not
qualify
the
--
if
it
did,
that
would
not
qualify
the
school,
would
it
for
eight
parochial
schools,
constitutionally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
why,
and
yet
you
say
if
that
distinction
would
be
enough
to
bring
it
within
the
board's
jurisdiction,
not
withstanding
the
examination
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
at
least
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
take
the
position
that
even
a
completely
religious
schools
would
be
subject
to
the
board's
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
why
defend
this
dichotomy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
sense
of
a
burden
on
free
exercise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
what
kind
of
burden
mr.
solicitor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
general
mccree,
may
i
ask
a
factual
question
that
perhaps
you
know.
is
the
bargaining
unit,
let's
say
in
the
quigleys,
where
there
are
30
religious
members
of
faculty
and
46
lay
members,
aren't
there
any
religious
persons,
members
of
the
bargaining
unit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
bishop
to
prefer
in
hiring
and
discharge
and
the
like
clerics,
overlay
persons?
