this
case
presents
a
question
whether
application
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
roman
catholic
operated
secondary
schools
were
both
secular
and
religious
subjects
are
taught
violates
the
establishment
clause
or
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
respondents
suggest
the
additional
question,
whether
the
national
labor
relations
act
applies
to
private
religious
schools
at
all.
our
reply
brief
incorrectly
and
inadvertently
stated
on
page
1
or
footnote
1
of
page
2
that
the
employers
did
not
present
this
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals.
we
were
partly
in
error,
respondent,
the
catholic
bishop
of
chicago
did
not
present
this
argument,
but
the
respondent
diocese
of
fort
wayne-south
bend,
inc.
has
statement
in
its
brief
that
properly
presented
this
issue
to
the
court
below.
and
we
apologize
and
raise
the
record
to
show
that
that
issue
is
still
before
the
court.
however,
as
we
show
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
our
understanding
sir.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
believe
that
that
issue
is
not
a
substantial
issue
and
as
we
have
endeavored
to
show
in
our
reply
brief,
the
congress
in
amending
the
act
in
1974
to
eliminate
the
exemption
in
section
2
(2)
for
nonprofit
hospitals,
expressly
approved
the
board's
policy
of
asserting
jurisdiction
over
private,
nonprofit
organizations.
and
we
believe
the
consistent
legislative
history
shows
no
congressional
intention
to
exempt
nonprofit
or
religiously
affiliated
employers
from
the
scope
of
the
act.
in
this
respect,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
concluded
that
the
act,
and
i
quote,
“clear
on
its
face
could
not
be
understood
to
preclude
jurisdiction.”
the
facts
maybe
briefly
stated.
respondent,
the
catholic
bishop
of
chicago,
a
corporation
sole,
operates
two
secondary
schools
for
boys,
quigley
north
and
quigley
south,
which
we
refer
to
as
the
quigleys.
these
schools
offer
a
secular
curriculum
in
all
respects,
indistinguishable
from
the
high
school
curriculum
afforded
by
the
public
schools.
but
in
addition,
it
also
offers
special
religious
training,
along
with
its
secular
curriculum.
the
admission
requirements
to
the
quigleys
are
different
from
those
of
the
public
schools
however.
the
quigleys
initially
admitted
catholic
boys
who
were
recommended
by
their
pastors
as
having
expressed
their
desire
to
pursue
their
priesthood.
subsequently,
other
catholic
boys,
also
recommended
by
their
pastors
were
allowed
to
matriculate,
if
their
pastor
believed
that
they
had
a
potential
for
their
priesthood,
even
though
it
had
not
been
recognized
or
expressed.
the
full-time
teachers
at
the
quigleys
have
contracts
with
the
respondent,
and
the
operating
budgets
of
the
quigleys
come
within
the
monetary
jurisdictional
standards
that
the
board
has
established.
a
million
dollars
in
revenue
in
a
given
year
and
more
than
$65,000.00
worth
of
goods
in
a
given
year
brought
directly
from
out
of
state.
the
quigleys
operate
primarily,
as
the
board
found,
as
college
preparatory
schools.
they
are
fully
accredited
by
the
state
and
by
the
north
central
accrediting
association.
they
send
however,
a
majority
of
their
students
to
secular
colleges.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
their
1974
graduation
class,
only
16%
went
on
to
diocesan
seminary
college,
niles
college.
the
other
respondent,
the
diocese
of
fort
wayne-south
bend,
inc.
operates
five
high
schools
in
14
counties
in
north
east
indiana.
these
schools,
like
the
quigleys
offer
full
program
of
college
preparatory
high
schools
subjects,
and
also
include
religious
subjects.
they
differ
from
the
quigleys
in
this
respect,
the
south
bend-fort
wayne
schools
admit
catholic
boys
who
have
not
express
the
desire
to
pursue
the
priesthood
or
have
the
potential
for
their
priesthood,
and
they
also
admit
some
non-catholic
students.
the
south
bend-forth
wayne
schools
also
satisfy
the
board's
self-imposed
monetary
jurisdictional
standard.
the
faculties
of
these
schools
are
interesting.
the
quigleys
employ
a
total
of
76
full-time
faculty
persons
of
whom
46
are
lay
teachers,
and
so
a
clear
majority
of
the
quigleys'
faculty
is
a
lay
faculty.
the
fort
wayne-south
bend
diocese
in
1974
employed
a
total
faculty
of
207
teacher,
182
of
which
were
lay
teachers,
and
of
course
only
25
affiliated
with
religious
orders.
in
september
and
october
1975,
pursuant
to
separate
representation
petitions
filed
by
the
quigley
education
association
and
the
community
alliance
for
teachers
of
catholic
high
school
that
has
a
felicitous
acronym
catch,
elections
were
conducted
in
two
units,
both
quigleys
combine
four-unit,
and
the
fort
wayne-south
bend
schools,
five
schools
as
a
unit.
the
unit
was
composed
of
all
lay
faculty
and
the
unions
won
and
were
duly
certified.
the
employers
refuse
to
bargain
and
the
regional
director
issued
complaints
charging
violations
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
(5).
and
the
employers
admitted
their
refusal
to
bargain,
because
first
that
their
schools
were
completely
religious
instead
of
religiously-affiliated
which
is
a
dichotomy
that
the
board
has
establish
to
determine
whether
it
will
exercise
its
jurisdiction
over
private
religious
schools.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
board
adheres
to
that
dichotomy,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
its
discretion
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
believes
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
all
that
come
within
that
affect
commerce.
but
it
is
preferred
to
follow
this
distinction.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
do
i
support
it
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
the
board
is
not
required,
as
i
understand
it,
to
exercise
its
full
jurisdiction.
for
a
number
of
years,
the
board
refrained
from
exercising
jurisdiction
at
all
over
private
schools,
not
just
religious
schools.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
might
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan
it
might
from
the
phraseology
employed,
but
that
is
not
the
way
it
has
applied
this
test.
it
is
applied
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
might
accept
the
board
looks
solely
to
secular
aspects
of
the
schools
in
making
this
dichotomy.
for
example,
if
the
school
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
public
school,
if
it
offers
a
full
secular
course,
and
then
has
religious
courses.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
that
certainly
would
not.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
i
suggest
that
the
board
has
statutory
jurisdiction
into
consider
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
do.
it
is
our
position
that
the
board
has
jurisdiction
over
completely
religious
schools.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
don't
feel
that
i
have
to
defend
the
dichotomy.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
except
to
suggest
that
i
think
that
the
board
has
the
discretion
to
decide
whether
it
will
exercise
this
jurisdiction,
but
we
contend
that
it
has
jurisdiction
over
both
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
that
is
not
the
reason
the
board
has
adopted
it,
because
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
think
probably
not,
the
board
apparently
is
looking
to
see
whether
what
is
its
impact
on
commerce,
and
it
is
determined
that
the
completely
religious
schools
which
have
been
schools
in
its
experience
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
that
afforded
after
school
religious
instruction
and
were
not
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
public
schools,
didn't
have
the
requisite
impact.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
they
have
not
applied
it
in
that
fashion.
they
have
applied
it
if
the
seminary
that
trains
priest
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
regular
high
school.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
or
grade
school,
they
have
applied
it.
they
have
refrain
from
doing
so,
only
with
the
after
school,
strictly
religious
program.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i've
heard
that
expressed.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
believe
it
does
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
is,
but
fortunately
we
do
not
think
that's
involved
here
in
this
case.
we
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
question
whether
the
exercise
of
its
statutory
authority
of
these
schools
that
are
in
fact,
the
functional
equivalent
of
high
schools,
but
also
teach
religious
subjects
is
forbidden
because
of
conflict
either
with
the
establishment
clause
or
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well
the
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
concede
that
the
general
language
was
equally
clear,
but
the
mcculloch
case,
if
memory
serves,
is
a
case
involving
seaman
on
foreign
vessels.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
whether
they
would
be
within
the
ambit
of
--
whether
they
would
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board.
and
there
it
was
felt,
because
of
the
international
aspects
or
because
of
the
possible
international
repercussions
of
asserting
jurisdiction
over
foreign
seaman,
over
foreign
flag
vessels
would
require
an
expressed
statement
of
congress'
intention
to
bring
them
under
this
rule.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
submit
that
it
is
not,
because
of
other
regulatory
measures
have
been
held
applicable
to
religiously
affiliated
schools,
fire
regulations,
attendance
laws,
health
and
safety
provisions.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
nor
does
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
nor
does
the
ordering
question
here
affect
the
kind
of
teaching.
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
only
order
here
is
an
order
to
bargain
about
rates
of
pay,
wages,
conditions
of
employment,
and
if
an
agreement
is
reached
to
embody
it
in
an
order.
they're
not
told
what
to
teach,
but
merely
to
bargain
on
the
items
that
i've
just
referred
to
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
now,
we
submit
that
it
would
have
no
impact
at
all
on
methods
of
teaching
or
content
of
teaching
if
limited
to
these
aspects
that
i've
mentioned,
wages,
hours,
conditions
at
that
point.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
don't
believe
--
i'm
not
aware,
i
am
not
aware
that
any
curriculum
content
or
pedagogical
techniques
have
been
made
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
in
the
public
school
area.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
there
may
be
some
indirect
impact,
but
that's
not
before
us
today.
in
1963,
this
court
considered
the
case
of
the
associated
press
versus
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
there,
it
was
suggested
that
there
might
come
a
time,
when
the
first
amendment
guarantee
a
freedom
of
speech,
it
might
be
implicated,
if
the
labor
board
took
cognizance
of
--
or
extended
its
jurisdiction
over
employees
of
newspapers
or
in
this
case,
the
associated
press,
which
is
a
coalition
of
them.
and
this
court
stated
then
that
it
would
not
decide
hypothetical
situations
that
might
not
ever
be
presented
to
it
for
its
decision.
and
it's
interesting
that
in
the
42
years,
since
associated
press
was
decided,
this
court
has
never
had
to
decide
whether
affording
recognition
to
the
rights
of
newspaper
of
journalist
to
collectively
bargain
has
never
implicated
a
first
amendment
violation.
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
what
we
have
here,
and
we
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
when
it
decided
based
upon
these
hypothetical
problems
that
this
would
be
somehow
a
violation
of
both
the
establishment
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
in
blurring
the
distinction
between
these
two
clauses,
and
we
think
that
this
case
presents
primarily
a
question
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
and
that
it
does
not
constitute
an
establishment
of
religion.
but
if
anything
at
all,
as
i
would
suggest,
a
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
yes.
and
there
of
course
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
below
suggested
that
somehow
it
would
inhibit
the
exercise
a
freedom
of
religion,
and
we
suggest
in
this
respect
that
the
free
exercise
clause
is
absolute
insofar
as
it
applies
to
belief.
and
that
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
cannot
legislate
to
control
a
person's
belief.
but
it
is
not
absolute
insofar
as
it
impinges
upon
conduct;
believe
to
be
mandated
by
or
consistent
with
belief.
and
this
is
the
distinction
that
this
court
has
made.
and
so
we
suggest
that
the
threshold
question,
when
one
approaches
a
claim
of
violation
with
the
free
exercise
clause
is
first,
whether
the
conduct
complained
of
is
indeed
mandated
or
directed
by
religious
belief.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
and
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
understand
it
to
say
that
too,
but
i
suggest
here
that
to
bargain
collectively
with
labor
unions
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
religious
beliefs
of
these
respondents,
and
they
don't
say
so
either.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
might
have
a
different
problem
then.
we'd
have
problem
such
as
this
court
confronted
in
yoder,
where
the
amish
children
were
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
didn't
believe
in
pursing
education
beyond
the
ninth
grade
or
the
eighth
grade.
and
that
was
clearly
a
religious
belief
of
theirs
and
this
court
determined
that
it
was
possible
to
allow
this
free
exercise,
because
there
was
no
showing
of
an
overriding
governmental
interests.
but
it
did
engage
in
the
balancing
test,
but
here
we
suggest
that
this
isn't
the
seventh
day
adventist
appeal
or
case,
this
is
a
case
involving
the
catholic
parochial
schools
and
we
suggest
that
the
catholic
position,
as
far
as
labor
unions
are
concerned,
is
one
of
support.
we
would
refer
the
court
to
an
encyclical
of
pope
leo
xiii,
rerum
novarum
which
recognized
the
right
of
employees
to
organize
and
bargain
collectively.
and
more
recently,
mater
et
magistra
which
is
an
encyclical
of
pope
john
xxiii,
i
believe
in
1961,
which
also
took
the
same
position.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
understand
them
not
to
say
that
to
have
to
bargain
does
that,
they
are
supposing
consequences
subsequent
to
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
this
is
the
same
approach,
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
associated
press.
it
was
decided
in
1936
and
this
court
said,
we
will
decide
that
when
it
becomes
necessary
and
it's
interesting,
as
i
indicated,
it
has
not
become
necessary
in
this
other
first
amendment
area.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
certainly
would
and
i
find,
as
this
court
has
found
a
difficult
at
times
to
reconcile
the
establishment
clause
with
a
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
in
walz,
i
believe
this
court
said
that
there
has
to
be
some
giving
in
the
joints,
where
they
come
together,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
free
exercise
clause
philosophically
has
some
--
creates
some
problems
under
the
establishment
clause,
because
it
allows
a
person
who
professes
religion
as
motivating
his
behavior
to
raise
--
i
present
arguments
that
a
person
who
does
not
profess
religion
to
present.
and
in
that
respect,
it
impinges
somewhat
upon
the
establishment
clause,
and
that's
what
makes
these
cases
extraordinarily
difficult.
now,
we
believe
what
this
case
demonstrates
is
that
with
these
respondents,
the
order
which
is
merely
an
order
to
bargain
with
a
duly
elected
representatives
does
not
contravene
any
religious
belief
that
is
asserted.
and
therefore,
under
the
free
exercise
clause
we
don't
have
to
pursue
it
any
further.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
they
are
not.
the
definition
of
the
unit
that
was
made
was
consisted
just
of
the
lay
teachers,
none
of
the
members
of
a
religious
order.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
a
difficult
question
to
answer,
i
would
think
probably
not,
unless
it
had
anti-union
animus.
i
would
think
it
would
be
appropriately
within
his
power
to
prefer
to
have
a
member
of
a
religious
order
added
to
the
faculty
for
a
specific
purpose,
in
preference
to
a
lay
person,
who
might
not
even
be
a
member
of
his
faith.
but
if
it
was
done
for
an
anti-labor
reason,
with
anti-labor
animus,
then
it
might
be
an
unfair
labor.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
my
answer
would
be
the
same
mr.
chief
justice,
because
there
you
would
focus
whether
there
was
an
anti-union
animus.
if
i
may
just
answer
just
a
little
further,
there
is
a
case
that
we
cite
that
has
a
reason
in
which
it
was
asserted
that
the
principal
of
the
school
read
a
particular
scripture
passage
that
contained
a
threat
against
union
activity.
and
the
board
heard
that
and
decided
in
favor
of
the
bishop,
who
is
the
employer
in
this
case,
finding
that
it
did
not
--
which
didn't
require
to,
do
anything
except
determine
whether
this
attitude
was
threatening,
and
which
again
is
a
secular
reference,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
in
that
case
the
board
would
have
a
problem
that's
not
dissimilar
from
problems
that
it
entertains
everyday,
when
an
employee
is
discharge
from
being
a
poor
worker,
but
for
being
a
union
activist.
and
there
the
board
makes
a
determination
what
was
the
real
reason.
and
if
it
satisfied
that
the
real
reason
was
one
prohibited
by
the
act
then
it
will
hold
for
the
employer,
otherwise
it
will
uphold
--
i
mean
the
employee
otherwise
it
will
uphold
the
employer.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
oh!
i
would
think
so.
i
would
think
the
board
could
not
look
into
whether
the
alleged
conduct
was
in
fact
heretical.
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
we're
not
to
look
into
the
validity
of
religious
doctrine.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
a
reference
of
reading
list
would
be
a
secular
reference
and
this
is
was
--
if
there
was
in
fact
a
(voice
overlap).
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
if
a
teacher
went
beyond,
even
a
lay
teacher,
went
beyond
a
prescribed
reading
list,
this
would
give
a
ground
for
disciplinary
action
that
wouldn't
at
all
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice.
a
teacher
hasn't
a
right
to
use
his
or
her
own
judgment
about
what
should
be
taught.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
oh!
i'm
certain
they
have
and
they
will,
but
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't
be
surprise
if
they
hadn't
do,
but
i
will
suggest
to
you
what
should
the
law
be
on
the
subject.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
this
is
what
we've
endeavored
to
say
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
i
might
just
conclude
by
suggesting
that
when
a
religiously
affiliated
organization
chooses
to
enter
into
an
enterprise
that
affects
commerce,
it
must
accept
the
same
obligations
to
respect
laws
enacted
for
the
protection
for
societal
interest
that
is
imposed
on
similar
enterprises,
not
having
a
religious
organization.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
in
some
church
act,
if
the
church
functions
as
an
employer,
it
would
present
a
very
difficult
question.
i
suppose
if
a
church
ran
a
business,
an
industrial
business,
i'm
not
at
all
aware
that
that
business
would
be
exempt
from
the
thrust
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
just
because
of
its
religious
nature.
it
couldn't
deny
its
employees
the
benefits
at
the
congress
that's
decided
upheld.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
might
very
well
be.
and
i
have
no
difficulty
with
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
a
church
might
and
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know,
i'm
advised
if
the
court
please
that
there
are
religions
that
have
no
clergy
whatsoever
and
that
any
person
is
eligible.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
all
clergy,
we
used
to
encounter
that
during
the
war
if
you
recall.
