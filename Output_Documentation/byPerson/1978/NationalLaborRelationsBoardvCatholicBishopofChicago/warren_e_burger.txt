chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
arguments
next
in
752
national
labor
relations
board
against
the
catholic
bishop
of
chicago.
mr.
solicitor
general
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
not
agree
that
this
dichotomy
shed
some
light
upon
the
problem
of
whether
there
is
an
interference
or
an
impact
on
religion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
not,
perhaps
not,
but
do
you
--
my
question
is
would
you
agree
that
it
shed
some
light
on
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
that
you
mean
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
rather
completely
religious,
do
you
mean
the
seminary
that
trains
priests
among
other
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
grade
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
has
it
not
been
a
tenet
of
the
catholic
faith
and
of
some
others
faiths
that
operates
schools,
that
if
the
children
are
inculcated
with
the
principles
of
the
faith
and
of
religion
and
morals
in
the
first
dozen
years
of
their
lives,
then
they
are
adherence
to
that
faith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
permeate
the
literature
on
the
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
contrary
of
that
is
--
some
of
the
antireligious
countries,
communist
for
example,
who
make
it
a
felony
to
teach
religion
to
a
child
under
12
or
under
15,
there's
some
relationship
there,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
none
of
those
affect
the
kind
of
teaching,
do
they?
that
goes
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
their
own
neutral,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
--
from
that
i
take
it
that
it's
your
position
that
the
bargaining
process,
the
total
bargaining
process
would
have
new
impact
whatever
upon
methods
of
teaching
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
suggest
that
that's
true
with
the
public
schools
that
the
process
has
not
had
any
impact
on
how
teaching
has
been
conducted,
even
though
there
it
is
limited
to
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
neither
directly
nor
indirectly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
concede
that
there
is
perhaps
some
difference
between
free
press,
free
expression
on
the
one
hand
and
the
two
religion
clauses
on
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we've
said
in
some
opinions,
there's
a
tension
between
the
two.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
answer
be
the
same,
if
the
hiring
authority
preferred
members
of
the
faith
over
members
of
other
faiths
or
persons
who
have
none?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
a
teacher,
a
lay
teacher,
of
some
either
a
member
of
the
same
faith
or
not
assigned
the
reading
of
books
which
were
condemned
by
the
hiring
authority,
so
these
books
are
not
on
the
reading
list.
the
teachers
said,
“yes,
they
are.”
who's
going
to
ultimately
decide
content
in
that
course?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i'm
assuming
that
it
was
declared
by
the
authority
of
the
church,
that
it
impinged
on
the
faith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
bargaining
agents
have
never
both
suggested
and
supported
the
power
of
a
teacher
in
a
public
school
to
do
just
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
maintained
it
was
strikes
and
threats
of
strikes,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
not
also
be
true
if
the
operations
of
a
church
itself,
does
not
every
church
purchase
something
that
is
moving
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
pastors
are
moved
from
one
place
to
another
in
some
faiths.isn't
that
possible,
if
that
would
--
the
church
itself
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
book
publishing
company
might
be
an
example
of
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
rueben.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
janitors
and
the
people
who
run
the
building?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
they
have
not
met
the
qualifications
required
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
more
question
before
you
sit
down.
i
suppose
when
the
state
withdraws,
if
it
did
withdraw,
the
certification
of
an
amish
school
or
a
lutheran
school
or
a
catholic
school,
because
they're
spending
the
arithmetic
time
on
religion,
it
isn't
because
they're
teaching
religion,
but
because
they're
not
teaching
mathematics?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
at
1
o'clock.
thank
you
gentlemen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
