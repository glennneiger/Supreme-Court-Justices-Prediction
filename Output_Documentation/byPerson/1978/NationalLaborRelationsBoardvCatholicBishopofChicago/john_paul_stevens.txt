john
paul
stevens
what
about
minimum
wage
regulations,
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
don't
you
have
the
problem
that
some
of
the
catholic
schools,
they
pay
a
lesser
wage
scale,
i
suppose
for
lay
teachers,
who
are
perhaps
dedicated
persons
willing
to
donate
their
services
or
something
like
that.
and
perhaps
raising
the
wage
level
might
deny
them
the
opportunity
to
get
the
faculty
they
need.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
hire
non-catholic
attorneys,
i
think.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
suppose
that
can
be
said
too
of
the
private
secular
school,
can
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
talking
about
competition,
and
i'm
merely
saying
that
the
private
school
has
the
competition
angled
who
to
buck.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rueben,
what
about
certification
of
schools
in
the
state
law,
how
about
getting
them
certificated
as
kinds
of
places
that
will
be
acceptable
for
public
education?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
almost
a
contradiction
in
these
terms,
isn't
it
what
you
just
said?
you
said
one
thing,
then
another.
you
say
it's
almost
mechanical.
it's
mechanical,
as
long
as
they
don't
fill
the
mathematics
room
with
religion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
let's
assume
mathematics
class
teaches
nothing
but
religion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not
going
to
get
certificate,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
accept
what
i
said,
it
doesn't
teach
anything,
but
religion
in
the
mathematics
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
exactly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
how
about
half,
half
the
class,
half
everyday
in
mathematics?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
they
come
into
ground.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
teacher
qualifications,
in
that
process
of
certification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i'm
just
curious,
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is,
in
illinois,
must
the
catholic
schools
employ
certified
teachers
as
they
want
to
be
a
certified
school?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
they
did?
