was
it
dealt
with
by
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
was
it.
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
we
decided
in
your
favor
on
the
constitutional
issue
it
might
be
appropriate
to
remand
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
decision
in
the
first
instance.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
its
discretion
rather
than
it's
a
matter
of
--
its
understanding
of
constitutional
compulsion.
justice
potter
stewart
this
dichotomy
is
not
an
issue
here.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
leaves
me
to
ask
you
mr.
solicitor
general
about
the
hypothetical
case
and
according
to
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
here,
it's
not
a
hypothetical
case,
it
might
be
a
real
case
of
a
religious
group,
who's
religious
tenets
taught
that
organization
of
labor
unions
were
wrong,
i'm
talking
about
the
seventh
day
adventist
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
it
says
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
it
were?
what
if
these
were
a
seventh
day
adventist
school?
justice
potter
stewart
just
didn't
believe
in
education
to
be
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
general,
in
any
event,
despite
those
encyclicals
that
you
or
i
might
read
to
say
that
and
perhaps
they
do,
we
know
that
in
this
case
that
these
respondents
say
that
to
be
ordered
a
bargain
with
the
other
ends
would
violate
their
rights
under
the
first
amendment
whatever
those
encyclicals
might
say.
justice
potter
stewart
which
they
say
would
inevitably
follow
from
their
duty
if
they
were
--
there
was
imposed
upon
them
a
duty
to
bargain
with
these
labor
unions.
