mr.
don
h.
rueben
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
rely
not
only
upon
a
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause
but
believe
that
this
case
is
also
governed
by
the
entanglement
principles
that
renunciated
in
the
lemon
and
meek.
the
schools
that
are
before
this
court
are
the
same
schools
that
have
a
numerous
times
been
described
by
opinions
of
this
court,
as
schools
that
are
created
to
perpetuate
the
faith
and
to
propagate
the
faith.
these
are
the
typical
parochial
schools,
where
the
mission
is
to
bring
religion
to
the
children.
if
there's
a
difference
here
at
the
quigley
seminary,
is
designed
and
created
to
bring
people,
young
men
into
the
priesthood
which
we
described
at
our
brief
as
the
lifeblood
of
the
church
without
priests,
the
catholic
church
cannot
prevail
or
continue.
now,
because
of
the
religious
missions
involved,
and
the
court
has
noted
this
in
many
of
its
cases.
the
bishop
has
complete
and
absolute
authority
over
what
is
taught
to
the
schools,
that's
--
the
bishop
is
the
arbiter
of
what
is
taught
in
the
schools,
subject
only
to
the
usual
state
regulations
in
order
to
allow
(voice
overlap).
mr.
don
h.
rueben
only
the
neutral
state
regulations
of
compulsory
attendance
and
minimum
subjects
that
are
necessary
to
obtain
accreditation,
but
if
the
bishop
wants
for
example,
in
a
mathematics
class
to
have
religion
taught
as
examples
have
been
given
in
the
court's
opinion,
he
may
do
so.
he
is
the
supreme
authority
of
what
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
yes,
the
state
can
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
or
the
school
may
operate
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
we
do,
but
as
a
(voice
overlap).
mr.
don
h.
rueben
they
would
indeed,
except
that
your
honor,
in
yoder,
your
honors
decided
that
after
eighth
grade
the
state's
interest
didn't
compulsory
attendance
was
not
as
great
as
the
religious
principles
involved.
and
so,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
all
the
parochial
cases
that
have
been
decided
up
here,
in
each
instance,
what
has
been
noted
is
that
the
lay
teacher
is
subject
to
the
authority
and
to
the
jurisdiction,
and
to
the
command
of
the
bishop.
now,
the
nlrb
act
i
submit
to
the
court,
is
the
antithesis
of
what
is
the
religious
belief
that
the
religious
school
should
be
composed
of,
because
the
stated
purpose
of
the
nlrb
act
is
to
have
a
greater
parity
between
the
employer
and
the
employee,
that's
the
initial
statement
in
the
purposes
of
the
act,
it's
because
of
the
inequality
of
bargaining
power
between
employees
and
their
employers
that
the
act
was
created.
and
on
its
face,
the
nlrb
incursion
into
the
religious
schools
is
just
an
absolute
collision
of
the
first
amendment.
for
example,
the
board
has
the
power
to
conduct
elections
and
then
to
require
bargaining
and
bargaining
in
good
faith,
which
means
give
and
take.
it
has
the
right
to
order
reinstatement,
especially
if
it
determines
that
the
motive
is
mixed
that
is
there
is
an
anti-union
motif
and
another
motive.
it
has
the
right
to
take
action
against
the
employer
who
acts
in
a
way
that
frustrates
unionism
or
affects
it,
even
though
there
is
not
an
anti-union
intention.
and
the
board,
when
it
finds
a
violation,
receives
reports
or
may
order
receiving
reports
from
the
employer
as
to
compliance
and
what
have
you.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
this
type
of
power
can
square
with
the
deep-rooted
religious
conviction
that
the
bishop
is
the
final
and
absolute
authority
over
his
schools.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
absolutely.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
does
not
involve
teaching,
and
my
remarks
really
addressed
to
the
millieu
of
the
teaching
within
the
school,
and
there's
no
question
that
the
state
can
subject
the
school
to
zoning
regulations
and
health
regulations
and
what
have
you.
i'm
talking
about
bargaining
over
teaching.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
well,
your
honors
held
--
the
court
is
held
the
usury
case
that
the
states
have
that
power
reserve.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
minimum
wage
problem
is
the
same
problem,
because
you
do
not
have
as
you
do
in
the
typical
bargaining
history
of
collective
bargaining
with
teachers
the
dialogue
that
starts
with
wages
and
ends
up
with
curriculum
textbooks
and
what
have
you.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
if
pushed
to
it,
i
would
say
that
the
minimum
wage
law
should
not
apply
to
the
lay
school
teacher
in
the
religious
school.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
i
have
no
problem
and
think
the
janitors
have
every
right
to
have
the
nlrb
intrude.
that
does
not
involve
bargaining
over
teaching.
and
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
i
didn't
hear
you,
your
honor.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
yes.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
the
bishop
and
the
labor
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
no
sir,
i'm
saying
the
bishop
is
the
supreme
arbiter
when
it
comes
to
the
teaching
function.
the
bishop
is
the
boss
of
the
janitor,
your
honor,
but
the
janitor
does
not
involve
himself
in
the
teaching
function.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
because
in
connection
with
the
janitor,
you
do
not
have
an
encouragement
to
religious
beliefs,
you
will
not
have
as
i
perceive
it
an
unfair
labor
practice,
where
there
is
challenging
the
bishop
as
to
whether
or
not
his
discharged
with
cause
for
religious
grounds
or
because
of
an
anti-union
animus.
with
the
janitor,
you
will
not
have
an
unfair
labor
of
practice
over
the
composition
of
the
faculty.
for
example,
when
the
labor
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
oh!
i
think
if
i
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
i
think
that
that's
a
perfect
answer
to
the
question
and
i'll
stop
when
i
may
had.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
many
have
your
honor.
there
can
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
over
the
composition
of
the
faculty.
when
the
labor
relations
act
began,
88%
of
the
faculty
was
clergy,
now
it's
far
less.
if
the
bishop
elected
to
increase
as
it
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so,
his
faculty,
an
increase,
that's
something
though
have
to
be
bargained.
the
admission's
policy,
because
that
has
--
goes
to
the
workload.
the
textbooks,
the
method
of
teaching,
all
manor
of
things
and
look
at
what
happens.
it
is
very
clear
that
the
necessary
consequence
of
this
is
first
that
the
bishop
is
chilled.
he
will
try
to
avoid
the
zone
of
regulation
if
he
can.
second,
i
suggest
to
you
the
kind
of
inquiries
that
will
be
made
in
this
context,
are
far
greater
in
terms
of
entanglement
than
the
kind
of
activity
that
was
condemned
in
meek,
the
public
employee
going
into
the
catholic
schools
to
remedial
reading
or
the
wolman
case,
where
the
court
found
that
field
trips
were
an
unnecessary
entanglement.
and
the
labor
board
will
never
be
neutral,
when
it
comes
to
a
controversy
of
this
kind.
and
we
don't
have
to
have
a
parade
of
horribles
in
this
case.
we
have
fine
examples
of
what
will
happen.
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
one,
where
the
bishop
of
gary
was
cited
for
an
unfair
labor
practice,
because
of
a
prayer
that
he
gave,
citing
from
the
scriptures.
he
ultimately
was
sustained
by
the
nlrb,
but
it
took
531
pages
of
proceedings
to
do
so.
the
bishop
in
fort
wayne
was
cited
for
an
unfair
labor
practice,
because
he
disapproved
of
a
teacher
teaching
johnson
and
masters
in
the
courtroom.
he
also
was
cited
for
an
unfair
labor
practice,
because
he
wanted
to
terminate
an
employee
who
had
married
a
divorced
catholic.
he
also
was
cited
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
of
an
argument
between
a
lay
teacher
and
the
bishop
over
religious
instruction
and
how
it
will
be
given.
if
your
honors
look
at
what
happened
in
brooklyn,
where
since
1974
there's
just
been
enormous
litigation
that
the
church
school
was
forced
to
employ
somebody
that
regarded
as
a
person
teaching
heresy.
the
board
is
just
not
equipped
to
avoid
entangling
itself
in
this
area.
it
is
an
industrial
millieu
that
it
deals
in
and
it
started
out
on
a
very
strange
path,
which
everybody
tries
to
avoid
between
completely
religious
and
the
religious
associated.
a
path
or
a
test
of
unconstitutional,
a
test
that
the
af
of
l
in
filing
its
amicus
brief
here,
flatly
admits
it's
an
unconstitutional
test.
the
way
it
handled
this
profound
problem
that
is
now
here
in
very
summary
fashion.
the
questions
that
were
asked
if
you
read
the
proceedings
that
occurred
in
these
very
cases,
the
bishop
doing
a
good
job
of
what
is
a
liturgy
and
what
have
you.
it
is
an
entanglement
that
pails
into
insignificance,
the
entanglement
of
the
court
has
found
unconstitutional
in
past
cases.
it
is
impermissible
entanglement.
and
what
is
the
interest
that's
being
served
to
bring
on
this
pandora's
box,
this
parade
of
horribles.
97%
of
the
teachers
in
the
united
states
by-law
ought
not
allowed
to
have
the
nlrb
or
collective
bargaining,
they're
public
school
teachers.
the
commerce
involved
in
connection
with
parochial
schools
and
seminaries
is
very
limited.
and
indeed,
it's
intertwined
with
subsidies
and
i
wonder
when
someday
we
won't
see
bargaining
between
the
bishop
and
the
faculty
of
the
school
if
the
government's
position
sustained
here
as
to
the
amount
of
subsidies
that
the
bishop
should
put
forth.
both
of
these
schools
have
to
be
subsidized;
quigley
i
think
it's
$600,000.00
a
year
and
its
$750,000.00
in
fort
wayne.
the
schools
before
your
honors,
do
have
a
grievance
procedure,
in
both
instances
so
that
the
teachers
are
not
left
helpless
or
just
to
whim
of
the
bishop.
furthermore,
there's
a
very,
very
important
governing
factor
here
in
all
of
these
schools,
this
called
the
marketplace.
when
these
schools
come
and
compete
for
lay
teachers,
they're
competing
with
the
public
school,
and
that's
why
i
answered
mr.
justice
stevens
questions
concerning
minimum
wage.
and
now,
they're
competing,
there
are
3%
employer
competing
with
a
97%
employer
and
if
they
do
not
do
right
and
proper
by
their
teachers,
they
will
not
employ
them
and
they
will
not
have
teachers
to
staff
their
school.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
that's
correct,
the
difference
is
that
in
the
private
sector,
you
do
not
have
the
first
amendment
consideration,
so
it's
simply
and
it's
an
entirely
different
question.
you
do
not
have
the
entanglement.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
i
concede
that.
in
the
parochial
cases
the
court
has
made
a
point
of
the
political
strife
that
can
occur,
the
dialogue
that
will
occur
in
the
legislature
every
time
an
annual
appropriation
is
requested.
it
is
perfectly
obvious
from
what's
occurred
here
since
1974,
when
the
board
took
jurisdiction
that
there
will
be
constant
litigation
over
the
bishop's
authority
because
now
he
must
share
it
with
the
nlrb
and
the
union.
and
i
can
foresee
efforts
in
the
congress
to
undo
what
the
nlrb
might
do.
and
i'm
sure
that
if
one
went
into
the
precincts
of
brooklyn
they
would
discover
that
raw
motion
and
great
religious
dialogue
and
bitterness
has
occurred
because
of
what
happened
in
the
brooklyn
schools.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
because
mr.
justice
rehnquist
as
i
guess
said
walz
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
the
zoning
cases
decided
once
in
court,
the
interaction
between
the
school
teacher
and
the
bishop
is
a
day-by-day
occurrence,
conditions
changed
constantly.
we're
dealing
with
the
dynamics
of
education.
we're
dealing
with
something
that
is
not
a
constant.
once
the
building
is
built
we're
done
with
the
zoning.
once
you
comply
with
the
fire
code,
we're
done.
that's
not
true
in
terms
of
what
happens
in
the
classroom
or
the
kind
of
things
that
can
be
collectively
bargained
about
by
teachers.
and
in
our
brief
we
discussed
the
fact
that
those
who
have
studied
the
history
of
collective
bargaining
in
educational
institutions
have
discovered
that
what's
starts
out
to
be
as
the
solicitor
general
suggested
wages
and
hours,
as
i
think
a
very
simplistic
notion
of
what
happens,
because
it
isn't
very
long
before
the
whole
warp
and
woof
of
the
school
and
the
way
it's
run
is
a
matter
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
i
think
there
again,
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
that
like
the
tax
exemption
is
something
that
has
occurred
for
years.
it's
a
fairly
almost
mechanical
test.
there's
no
religious
inquiry,
there's
no
preclusion
or
encouragement
to
the
beliefs
of
anybody
or
the
faith
of
anybody,
it's
just
are
the
subjects
taught
and
taught
in
a
manner
that's
acceptable,
and
there
all
secular
subjects.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
no,
i
think
the
court
has
set.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
well,
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
it
depends
whether
after
the
mathematics
class
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
then
it's
really
not
a
mathematics
class.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
well,
i
take
it
that
in
the
subject
like
mathematics,
and
i
think
it
was
justice
douglas
gave
the
example
that
in
a
mathematics
class
you
can
inject
religion
and
have
40,000
nuns
and
does
it
equal
40,000
priests
and
what
have
you,
i
take
it
that
the
test,
when
one
is
through
is
whether
they
take
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
more
than
that
whether
the
student
by
an
objective
test
can
divide,
understands
his
fractions,
knows
the
multiplication
tables,
there's
no
inquiry
as
to
as
religious
beliefs.
and
certification
is
i
think
--
and
i'm
not
suggesting
this
is
a
field
of
absolute.god
knows
the
court's
opinion
suggest
otherwise,
it's
a
matter
of
degree,
and
i
think
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
well,
the
certification,
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
certifies
teachers
regardless
of
race,
religion
or
what
have
you,
and
there
isn't
really
an
incursion
into
the
ability
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
i
don't
know
the
answer,
but
i
do
know
--
mr.
don
h.
rueben
well,
i
think
that
i
would
have
no
trouble
with
that,
because
that
would
be
in
effect
the
licensing
before
the
person
began
to
teach.
however,
if
you
go
back
into
the
history
of
parochial
schools,
when
the
parochial
schools
were
88%
staffed
by
nuns
and
priest
and
brothers,
i
suspect
there
was
no
certification.
and
so
long
as
the
end-product
resulted
in
an
acceptable
primary
or
secondary
education,
the
result
was
acceptable
and
the
certification
authority
was
satisfied.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
i
wish
it
were
so.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
i
wish
it
were
so,
the
parochial
school
must
comply
with
all
of
the
fire
regulations,
all
of
the
certification
regulations.
and
there
is
a
great
pleasing
authority
(voice
overlap).
mr.
don
h.
rueben
oh!
there
are
fire
inspections
and
there's
an
even
greater
policing
authority
its
called
parents.
and
they
will
react
very
quickly
if
their
children
are
not
being
educated
properly.
mr.
don
h.
rueben
that
is
correct.
now,
in
the
last
analysis,
i'd
like
to
conclude
by
suggesting
to
your
honors,
that
the
court
in
the
seventh
circuit
properly
described
the
situation
of
these
parties
here
as
in
a
no
lose
situation
--
no

situation.
in
this
case,
we
are
religious
associated
and
the
government
would
have
the
nlrb
being
able
to
come
into
the
school
and
cause
bargaining
that
would
necessarily
raise
the
cost.
the
cost
of
parochial
school
education
as
the
court
knows
has
gone
up
over
the
years,
so
that
the
states
have
strived
very,
very
hard
to
find
ways
to
get
money
to
the
parochial
schools.
and
the
court
has
found
that
this
in
most
instances
impermissible
entanglement.
and
now,
to
have
the
same
schools
to
be
treated
as
secular
and
not
eligible
for
money,
but
eligible
for
regulation,
not

me

of
the

offends

my
notions
of

mr.

that's
correct
and
the
state
--
the
states
only
concern
is
secular,
the
state
does
not
entangle
itself
by
that
kind
of
inquiry.
