mr.
h.
ober
hess
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
the
essence
of
this
case,
i
think,
is
best
presented
by
supposing
three
identical
camps.
the
first,
a
non-profit
camp
owned
by
a
governmental
body,
the
second,
a
non-profit
camp
owned
by
a
non-governmental
body,
and
the
third
of
which
there
are
a
significant
number
in
this
country,
a
private
commercial
camp
operated
for
the
profit
of
the
owner.
i
would
take
it
that
petitioner
has
conceded
that
a
camp
owned
by
a
governmental
body
is
entitled
to
just
compensation
determined
according
to
the
substituted
facilities
doctrine.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
i
take
it
then,
if
i
may
rephrase
my
sentence,
not
to
dispute
it
at
this
time.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
certainly,
it
is
open
to
this
court
despite
that
very
nice
dictum
of
chief
justice
taft
in
the
brown
case.
it's
open
to
this
court
to
demolish
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine.
i
would
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
to
demolish
it
to
the
extent
that
it
has
been
followed,
if
the
court
please,
in
10
circuits
and
rejected
in
none
and
in
some
state
courts
as
well.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
indeed,
not.
and
my
point
merely
is
that
it
has
had
really
a
universal
acceptance
in
the
district
--
in
the
circuits,
but
whether
it
concedes
it
or
not
is
not
all
together
the
point
here.
the
point
is
that,
as
the
decided
cases
in
the
circuits
now
stand,
a
camp
owned
by
a
governmental
body
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well,
i
would
--
i
cannot--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
i
base
by
statement
that
it
would
upon
the
comparable
cases
involving
bath
houses,
recreation
centers,
playgrounds,
and
public
parks.
i
would
put
them
in
an
indistinguishable
category
with
camps.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
yes.
now,
as
to
the
commercial
not-for-profit
camp,
it
clearly
is
not
entitled
to
have
its
award
determined
under
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine.
the
question
here,
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
just
compensation
for
a
non-profit
camp
owned
by
a
non-governmental
body
is
to
be
determined
as
it
is
for
a
governmental
camp
or
as
it
is
for
the
commercial
camp.
the
governmentally
owned
camp
receives
an
award
based
on
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine
when
three
conditions
are
met.
first,
that
the
fair
market
value
is
insufficient
to
obtain
a
functionally
equivalent
camp.
it's
not
a
question
of
the--
whether
there
is
some
kind
of
a
market
for
the
disposition
of
the
condemned
camp
but
whether
there
is
a
replacement
market
in
which
a
substitute
could
be
purchased
for
the
equivalent
of
the
award.
that's
the
first
test.
the
second
is
that
the
camp
was
fully
used
before
the
taking
and,
third,
that
the
taking
itself
did
not
eliminate
the
use
for
the
camp.
there
would
be
no
qualitative
evaluation
of
the
benefit
of
the
camp
or,
for
that
matter,
of
a
bath
house
or
school
or
a
playground
or
park.
the
benefit
in
the
cases
of
governmentally
owned
faci
--
operated
and
owned
facility,
the
benefit
is
presumed
from
the
fact
that
the
governmental
entity
decided
to
have
a
camp
and
that
the
camp
was
fully
used.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
governmental
unit
be
legally
obligated
to
replace
the
condemned
facility
and
that
is
all
spelled
out
very
clearly
in
a
note
in
the
yale
law
journal
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
the
synod,
the
respondent
seeks
the
same
treatment
here,
nothing
more
or
less.
it,
too,
must
demonstrate
that
the
fair
market
value
will
not
be
sufficient
to
obtain
a
functionally
equivalent
camp
in
the
replacement
market.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
--
or
immediately
prior
to
our
noon
recess,
i
was
pointing
out
that,
under
existing
decisions,
a
non-profit
camp
operated
by
a
governmental
body
would
have
to
show,
in
order
to
bring
into
play
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine,
three
things.
the
synod,
this
petitioner,
just
seeks
precisely
the
same
treatment
here.
it,
too,
must
demonstrate
that
fair
market
value
will
not
be
sufficient
to
obtain
a
functionally
equivalent
camp.
it's
the
replacement
market
that
must
be
taken
into
account.
and
secondly,
that
its
camp
was
fully
used
prior
to
the
taking
and,
thirdly,
that
the
taking
itself
did
not
eliminate
or
destroy
the
use.
the
benefit
of
the
camp,
as
in
the
case,
the
governmentally
owned
camp
is
presumed
from
the
fact
that
it
is
running
on
a
non-profit
basis
and
is
devoted
to
public
charitable,
educational,
or
religious
purposes.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
in
this
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
the
third
is
included
because
this
is
the
familiar
category
in
which
non-profit
activities,
which
are
classified
in
the
quasi-public
corporation
category,
are
expressed.
this
is
the
way
the
category
is
expressed.
it's
so-expressed
in
many
places
in
the
law.
a
non-profit
corporation
operated
for
charitable,
educational,
or
religious
purposes
--
public
charitable,
education,
or
religious
purposes.
that
is
the
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
yes,
a
number
of
times
in
the
code
and
elsewhere
in
our
jurisprudence.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
now,
in
this
case,
we're
not
talking
about
the
tennis
club
or
the
swimming
club
or
the
country
club.
excuse
me?
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well,
in
the
constitution
of
pennsylvania,
for
example,
and
in
real
estate
tax
exemption
cases
such
as
existed
in
new
york
which
came
under
inspection
in
walz
versus
the
tax
commission,
to
which
i
will
presently
refer
it
in
another
context.
as
i
say,
we're
not
talking
about
country
clubs.
they
certainly
would
not
qualify.
in
a
sense,
they're
non-profit,
but
they
are
not
devoted
to
public,
charitable,
educational
purposes
and
have
no
proper
claim
to
be
included
with
non-profit
organizations
which
operate
and
which
are
encouraged,
i
submit,
by
our
public
policy
to
operate.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well,
i
would
not
think,
your
honor,
that
that
would
put
it
in
the
category
of
a
non-profit
corporation
operated
--
organized
and
operated
for
public,
charitable,
educational,
or
religious
purposes.
no,
i
would
not
think
so.
now,
these
non-profit
corporations
i
refer
to
which
do
operate
and
are
encouraged
by
a
public
policy
to
operate
non-profit
facilities
for
public,
charitable,
educational,
and,
yes,
too
religious
purposes.
we're
talking
about
that
category
alone,
such
as
the
synod
in
this
case
and
we're
talking
about
non-profit
camps
and
schools
and
hospitals
and
homes
for
the
aged
and
similar
ilimasinary
institutions.
for
fifth
amendment
purposes,
we
submit
they
are
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
commercial
condemnee.
they
stand
rather
in
a
position
identical
with
the
governmental
condemnee.
now,
the
commercial
camp
owner,
and
this
is
an
important
point,
the
commercial
camp
owner,
having
decided
to
use
his
capital
in
the
commercial
market
place,
must
also
have
his
just
compensation
determined
in
the
commercial
marketplace,
and
that's
no
hardship.
the
value
of
his
facility
takes
into
account
its
profitability
and
its
earning
power,
and
he
is
made
whole
by
an
award
that
provides
him
with
an
opportunity
through
investment
or,
otherwise,
to
receive
a
comparable
return
on
his
capital
investment.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
that
would
contradict
the
non-profit
--
it
might
go
to
contradict
it.
it
would
depend
on
many
other
things.
i
--
that's
--
you
know
your
one
swallow
doesn't
make
a
summer,
but
it
would
certainly
go
a
long
way
to
contradict
the
non-profit
status,
if
it
were
just
a
way
for
--
to
slice
him
off
a
huge
salary
for
some
persons
that
private
benefit.
that's
not
this
case.
it's
not
contended
that
that
is
this
case.
now,
i've
just
said,
and
i
mean
to
emphasize
this
point,
that
non-profit
corporations
are
encouraged
by
public
policy
in
this
land
to
operate
these
non-profit
facilities
for
public,
charitable,
and
educational
purposes,
and
religious
too,
i
include
that,
that
this
policy
just
lies
so
deep
in
the
american
tradition,
which
leaves
large
measures
of
public
good
to
be
provided
in
whole
or
part
by
a
non-profit
organizations,
countless
voluntary
hospitals
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
homes
for
the
aged,
and
schools
and
colleges.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
i
am
not
asking
the
government,
your
honor,
to
give
us
any
money.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
i
am
asking
the
government
to
give
us
just
compensation.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
i
am
asking
for
just
compensation,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
in
dollars
and
cents,
i
am
asking
for
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
i
am
asking
--
our
evidence
was
the
effect
and
wasn't
contradicted
because
we
didn't
get
into
that
phase
at
the
trial.
the
government
had
a
witness
there
on
replacement
--
or
in
the
--
on
substitute
facilities
value.
it
was
not
called
because
we
didn't
get
into
that
phase
of
the
case.
our
testimony
was
the
effect
that
the
--
a
substitute
facility
would
cost
around
$4
million-3,
and
it's
not
--
that's
not
easy.
it
shouldn't
be
a
shocking
figure
because
this
was
a
big
operation.
this
had
a
capacity
of
600
children
at
a
time.
these
three
camps
combined
and,
out
of
that
three,
i
don't
remember
off
hand,
although
it's
in
the
record
what
went
to
make
up
that
total
of
$4
million
and
3,
but
two
items
that
had
come
to
my
mind.
replacing
the
sewage
facilities
alone
was
400,000-plus.
replacing
the
water
system
was
400,000-plus,
which
makes
ridiculous
that
$740,000.00-fair
market
figure
if
we
come
to
consider
the
question
of
what
is
just
compensation.
what
is
just?
it's
according
to
the
cases,
it's
what's
equitable,
what's
fair.
and,
we
submit
that
that's
not
fair
and
we
say
that
the
public
policy
of
this
country,
which
i
was
referring
to,
entitles
us
to
be
treated
the
same
as
the
governmental
condemnee
because
we
are
in
that
category
and,
in
a
very
real
sense,
the
government
does
not
and
need
not
and
probably
should
not
do
all
and
provide
all
these
facilities.
there
should
be
some
range
left
for
the
type
of
facility
we
are
talking
about
here
and,
to
a
large
extent,
these
non-profit
corporations
in
this
category
are
really
surrogate
to
government
and
when
their
facilities
are
condemned,
our
position
is
that
they
should
not
be
treated
differently
from
the
governmental
owner
of
similar
facilities.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
and
it's
this
very
policy
of
encouraging
volunteerism
which
makes
non-profit
corporations
of
this
category
quasi-public
corporations
in
the
language
which
was
used
in
walz
versus
the
tax
commission.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
now,
your
honor,
that's
a
different
category,
as
i
endeavored
to
point
out.
the
commercial
corporation,
when
its
facility
is
condemned,
take
the
commercial
camps,
as
i
--
take
the
closest
thing
to
it,
the
--
a
very
important
item
of
evidence
on
value,
for
condemnation
purposes,
would
be
the
profitability
of
the
facility
and
the
commercial
camp
would
in
--
would
and
should
get
an
award
that
would
be
sufficient
to
protect
that
profitability.
it
may
not
be
enough
to
buy
another
camp
because
the
price
of
facilities
may
have
gone
up
so
greatly
that
it
would
be
folly
to
take
that
money
and
put
it
into
another
camp,
but
it
ought
to
be
enough
to
produce
a
yield
comparable
to
what
the
commercial
camp
produced
and
that,
i
say,
is
fair.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well,
you
mean,
to
us,
a
non-profit
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
oh!
but,
if
your
honor
please,
in
a
condemnation
case,
the
value
of
the
real
estate
would
take
very
largely
into
account
its
profitability.
that's
a
common
type
of
evidence
where
a
commercial
facility
is
condemned.
the
jury
takes
into
account
how
--
whether
that
was
a
profitable
facility.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
yes.
now
well,
i
think
i've
said
enough
about
the
public
policy
involved
here,
the
public
policy
which
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
we
should
have
treatment
comparable
to
the
governmental
condemnation.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
yes,
it
has
to
be.
the
three
tests
that
the
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
that
would
be
another
case.
that
would
be
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
no,
if
the
court
please,
may
i
repeat
the
three
test.
the
operation
must
be
conducted
on
a
non-profit
basis.
it
must
be
conducted
for
charitable
educational,
etcetera
purposes.
it
must
be
fully
used
at
the
time
of
the
taking
and
the
taking
must
not
have
destroyed
its
use.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
that
would
have
bearing
upon
full
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
the
case,
your
honor,
supposes
is
different
from
the
case
here.
if
the
cap
were
in
its
death
rows
by
coincidence,
just
happen
to
be
in
its
death
rows,
when
the
condemnation
proceedings
came
along
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
that
would
bear
on
the
full
use
at
the
time
of
the
taking.
it
would
bear
on
the
full
use
at
the
time
of
the
taking.
now,
if
you've
got
one
of
those,
as
i
say
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
such
a
rare
coincidence
case
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
it
would
be
a
different
case
from
this.
this
case
was
in
--
we
were
in
full
swing.
it
was
fully
used
before
the
taking
and
no
--
the
taking
did
not
itself
destroy
the
use,
as
in
the
case
of
a
country
road
leading
through
a
condemned
dam
site
to
know
where.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
that
would
not
be
this
case
or
anything
closely
reassembling
it
in
our
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
yes.
well,
yes,
it's
a
broader
word
than
“non-profit.”
mr.
h.
ober
hess
charitable
embraces
a
whole
dictionary
of
considerations.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well,
if
it's
operated
on
a
non-profit
basis
for
wealthy
people
who
could
pay
and
don't,
it's
--
i
suppose
that
puts
it
in
the
category
of
a
country
club,
but
it's
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well,
the
episcopalians
have
the
money,
and
the
lutherans
have
the
good
intentions.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
precisely.
we
submit
that
whether
the
condemnee
is
a
municipal
corporation
or
a
non-profit,
charitable,
educational
corporation,
just
compensation
should
be
the
same
and
i
think
the
third
circuit
put
its
--
put
it
very
well
in
its
opinion.
on
the
first
appeal,
we
are
not
dealing
with
congressional
or
just.
it
comes
back
to
your
honor's
question.
we
are
not
dealing
with
congressional
or
just
which
might
justify
a
distinction
between
governmental
and
non-governmental
community
facilities.
rather,
says
the
third
circuit,
we
are
dealing
with
judicial
interpretation
of
the
taking
clause.
accepting
the
interpretation
that
it
protects
the
value
of
community
uses,
there
is
no
basis
for
distinguishing
between
governmental
and
private
community
uses.
that's
the
third
circuit
and
i
might
just
add
this
further
indicative
of
this
approach,
the
communi
--
the
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws
have
promulgated
and
recommended
for
the
adoption
by
the
states
a
code
on
condemnation
containing
a
--
in
which
they
have
a
adopted
the
substitution
doctrine
for
non-profit
corporations
on
a
basis
similar
to
what
we
are
contending
for
here.
now,
the
government
does
not
dispute
--
i
think
they
don't
dispute
and
it
has
been
uniformly
decided
in
every
case
where
it's
come
and
get
--
come
up
to
date
that
subordinate
state
governmental
units
get
their
condemnation
awards
under
and
only
under
the
same
fifth
amendment
clause
which
applies
to
us.
for
this
purpose,
cities
and
school
districts,
townships
and
towns
are
treated
as
the
same
as
private
condemnees
because
the
fifth
amendment
clause
refers
to
the
taking
of
private
property
for
public
purposes.
and
for
this
purpose,
these
state
units
are
treated
the
same
as
we
are.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
the
federal
government?
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
the
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well,
of
course,
many
subordinate
governmental
units
also
lack
eminent
domain.
that's
a
statutory
matter
in
each
state.
it's
a
state
statutory
matter.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
we
want
to
say
we
want
an
award
of
just
compensation.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
yes,
it
is.
now,
the
government
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
what?
had
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
well,
the
southeastern
pennsylvania
synod
of
the
lutheran
church
in
america
is
the
respondent
here.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
that's
right.
they
are
the
owner
of
the
property.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
that
is
the
cost
of
the
substitute.
so,
it's
4
million-3,
i
think,
according
to
the
testimony,
but
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
and
the
same
thing
was
true
of
the
bath
house
case
in
new
york.
the
award
that
was
given
before
the
substitute
facilities
applied
was
simply
--
or
at
least
the
testimony
was,
it
was
about
5
million
and
about
1.5
million
was
what
was
determined
under
the
substitute
facilities
application.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
this
further
point.
the
--
the
government
tries
to
make
a
distinction
by
saying
the
governmental
unit
is
under
some
kind
of
a
legal
necessity
and
we
are
not.
now,
that
distinction
i
think
fails
on
two
counts.
firstly,
the
legal
necessity
has
been
ruled
out
at
least
in
the
second
and
eighth
circuits,
and
a
different
test
applied
which
makes
it
discretionary
with
the
governmental
unit.
but,
secondly,
in
this
case,
it
can
be
guaranteed
that
we'll
use
the
--
if
there's
any
doubt
about
it,
that
we
will
use
the
award
for
the
creation
of
a
substitute
facility
and
it
can
be
done
so
under
section
285
of
the
condemnation
--
the
federal
condemnation
statute
by
making
the
award
in
trust
for
release
as
the
facility
is
built.
this
--
this
treatment
is
available,
in
our
opinion,
under
the
general
language
of
section
285
(a)
in
the
yale
law
journal
note
cited
in
our
brief,
i
think
so,
too.
now,
one
final
point.
the
government
charges
that
to
apply
the
substitute
facilities
rule
to
us
is
to
give
us
a
windfall,
and
i
think
this
might
be
in,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall's
mind.
the
government
says
that
we
will
get
new
buildings
for
what
may
have
been
dilapidated
buildings
with
no
adjustment
for
depreciation.
now,
this
assertion
is
without
foundation,
first,
on
a
factual
basis
because
the
fact
is
and
the
evidence
shows
it
that
our
structures
were
not
dilapidated
but
were
well-maintained.
the
further
fact
is
that
we
have
--
mr.
h.
ober
hess
they
weren't
new.
mr.
h.
ober
hess
they
weren't
new.
the
further
fact
is
that
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
that
an
adjustment
should
be
made
in
the
substitute
facilities
award
for
the
economies
which
new
structures
would
afford.
now,
we
do
not
concede
that
depreciation
should
be
deducted.
that's
a
technical
term
and
one
that
i
think
has
been
used
too
loosely
in
some
of
the
cases.
we
do
not
concede
that
depreciation
should
be
deducted.
depreciation
is
arbit
--
is
an
arbitrary
commercial
accounting
technique,
whereby
cost
is
recovered
under
current
profits.
in
substitute
facilities
cases,
there
is
a
projection
of
the
cost
of
the
equivalent
with
a
discount
in
the
language
that
was
used
by
the
second
circuit.
these
are
the
second
circuit's
words,
“a
discount
by
reason
of
the
benefit
which
accrues
to
the
condemnee
when
a
new
building
replaces
one
with
expired
useful
years.”
now,
the
second
circuit
was
very
careful
not
to
refer
to
depreciation
but,
instead,
did
carefully
refer
to
a
discount
by
reason
of
the
benefit
which
accrues.
and
the
second
circuit
also
reassured
the
government
with
these
further
words,
“even
when
substitution
is
required,
sumptuous
awards
need
not
be
feared.
exact
duplication
is
not
essential.
the
substitute
need
only
be
functionally
equivalent.
the
equivalence
is
one
of
utility.”
the
--
my
friend
raises
a
further
point,
which
i
think
is
purely
spectral,
that
we
may
take
the
award
and
apply
it
for
totally
unrelated
uses.
the
same
could
be
said
for
the
award
to
a
city
for
bath
houses
and
recreation
centers
but,
again,
the
condemnation
statute
will
protect
this
situation
perfectly
be
the
condemnee,
a
municipal
corporation
or
a
non-profit
corporation.
as
to
the
future,
the
specter
has
projected
and
the
government
says
we
may
rebuild
the
camp
and
later
discontinue
its
use
as
such.
again,
we
say
that
the
same
comment
applies
equally
to
the
governmental
condemnee.
short
of
a
sale
of
the
camp,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
use
of
such
a
single-purpose
facility
could
be
greatly
altered
and
if
it
is
sold
for
other
purposes,
the
price
realized
will
contain
its
own
penalty,
in
that,
the
proceeds
will
in
all
likelihood
be
as
deficient
as
is
the
market
value
award
already
entered
in
this
case.
in
closing,
may
it
pleas
the
court,
the
question
in
human
terms
in
this
case
is
whether
the
non-profit
condemnees
camp
can,
with
constitutional
impunity,
be
expropriated
and
its
full
use,
purpose,
and
function
forever
destroyed.
that's
the
result
the
government
seeks
sanction
for
here.
thank
you.
