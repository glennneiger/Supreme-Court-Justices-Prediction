justice
william
h.
rehnquist
am
i
right,
gener
--
i'm
thinking
that
this
court
has
even
applied
that
doctrine
to
public.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
the
case
too
in
cors,
wasn't
it,
where
the
ships
condemned
had
risen
in
value
and
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
said
the
award
--
the
just
compensation
award
need
not
be
sufficient
to
enable
the
owner
to
buy
ships
at
an
inflated
value
because
the
inflated
value
had
been
created
by
the
government.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
understood
--
i
didn't
understand
it
to
concede
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
court
has
never
so-held.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
surely,
we're
not
bound
by
the
holdings
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it's
expressed
in
many
places
of
the
law,
like
the
internal
revenue
code,
or
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
other
than
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
country
club
gave
a
free
golf
clinic
once
a
week?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
non-profit
company
paid
its
director
a
salary
that
the
government
claimed
was
three
times
what
a
comparable
director
would
receive?
would
that
be
a
litig
--
litigable
issue
in
the
served
condemnation
that
it
called
itself
a
non-profit
company
but
was
really
a
way
to
give
a
very
fancy
salary
to
the
chief
executive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hess,
did
this
“charitable”
mean
something
more
than
non-profit
in
your
definition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
assuming
it's
non-profit,
what
more
does
“charitable”
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
instead
of
lutheran,
these
have
been
very
wealthy
episcopalians
that
had
gone
to
this
camp?
