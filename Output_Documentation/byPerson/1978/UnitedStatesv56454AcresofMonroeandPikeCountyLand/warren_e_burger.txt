chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
land
in
monroe
and
pike
county.
mr.
barnett,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
isn't
very
helpful
to
use
a
capitalization
approach
on
a
voice
camp
which
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
barnett,
where
lies
the
authority
to
define
what
is
just
compensation,
exclusively
with
congress
or
is
it
with
the
courts
or
where?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
court
could
say,
in
your
view,
that
just
compensation
means
to
do
justice
presumably,
and
that
when
you
take
something
away
from
a
person,
you
want
to
give
him
the
equivalent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
only
addressing
myself
to
the
ultimate
authority.
in
your
view
then,
i
take
it,
that
if
the
principle
of
such
a
longstanding
in
our
jurisprudence
were
to
be
changed,
it
should
be
changed
not
that
by
the
court
but
by
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
just
talking
about
enlargement
substitution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
certainly,
when
i
--
taking
demolishes,
let
us
say,
a
small
college
in
an
isolated
place,
a
non-denominational,
so
you
keep
away
from
the
first
amendment
that
you're
about
to
address.
there's
no
market
for
small
colleges
in
isolated
areas,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
isn't
the
kind
of
market
you
have
for
real
estates
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
washington.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
i
said
“no
market,”
there's
not
a
very
good
market
for
colleges
campuses
and
things
of
that
kind,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
case
illustrates
something
about
the
marketability
and
how
much
market
there
is
for
boy's
camps,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
because
it's
up
in
pocono.
you
do
have
a
large
area
there,
don't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
hess.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock,
mr.
hess.
mr.
hess,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
barnett,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
he
--
i
thought
he
cleared
that
up
somewhat
when
he
analogized
it
to
a
charitable
hospital.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
public
service
he
is
turning
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
that
different
from
allowing
the
national
cathedral,
which
i
assume
is
tax
exempt,
or
the
shrine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
giving
of
public
money
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
distinguished
from
a
recompense
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
for
a
taking.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
barnett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
