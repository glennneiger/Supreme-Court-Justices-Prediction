but
that's
just
--
that
will
be
--
just
be
the
government's
opinion
as
to
what
the
constitutional
law
might
be.
it
certainly
doesn't
concede
his
concession
might
not
control
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
court
has
never
decided
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
not
to
embrace
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
camp
--
does
the
public
or
does
the
non-profit
facility
have
to
be
in
existence
and
operating
to
invoke
your
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
government
condemned
the
day
after
the
organization
passed
a
resolution
saying,
“our
--
we've
been
doing
a
great
job,
but
our
facilities
are
worn
out
and
we
can't
afford
to
replace
them,
so
we're
closing
down
at
the
end
of
the
year.”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
still
be
the
same
valuable
function.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
in
my
example
the
only
reason
this
very
valuable
public
function
doesn't
go
on
is
that
there
isn't
--
that
the
organization
doesn't
have
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
similarly,
in
the
actual
case,
if
there's
a
condemnation
and
they
play
only
the
fair
market,
the
only
reason
the
organization
does
--
won't
continue
is
that
it
doesn't
have
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
death
row
is
only
because
they
didn't
have
the
money
to
replace
the
sewer
plant
or
the
water
facility.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
would
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
also
make
your
argument
in
the
case
where
an
organization
was
about
to
--
had
the
great
plans
to
build
a
camp.
then
they
got
right
up
to
it
and
then
they
suddenly
announced
it
“we're
abandoning
our
plans
because
we
haven't
got
the
money
to
build
it,”
and
then,
the
government
condemned
and
you
said,
"well,
gee!
it
would
be
nice
if
you
paid
us
enough
money
for
this
land
to
build
a
camp.”
justice
byron
r.
white
even
a
lutheran
country
club?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
weren't
new
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
weren't
depreciated.
