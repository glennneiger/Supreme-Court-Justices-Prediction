mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
when
the
government
condemns
facilities
that
are
operated
on
a
not-for-profit
basis
by
a
church
or
another
private
entity,
the
measure
of
just
compensation
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
is
the
fair
market
value
of
facilities
taken
or
whether,
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
the
cost
of
constructing
substitute
facilities.
the
respondent,
the
southeastern
pennsylvania
synod
of
the
lutheran
church
in
america,
owned
three
separate
parcels
of
land,
totaling
about
300
acres
on
the
delaware
river
in
northeastern
pennsylvania
which
had
used
those
three
summer
camps
for
the
young
people.
in--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
564
acres,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
included
a
number
of
tracks
besides
the
three
owned
by
the
synod.
at
the
beginning
of
the
appendix,
you'll
find
the
declarations
of
taking
applicable
to
all
the
tracks,
and
the
synod
tracks
are
three
of
them.
in
june
of
1970,
the
united
states
condemned
these
three
parcels
for
a
river
project.
six
years
before,
in
1964,
anticipating
that
the
land
would
be
condemned,
respondent
had
purchased
some
3,800
acres
of
land
in
the
nearby
pocono
as
a
replacement
site
for
its
camps.
when
the
land
on
the
river
was
taken,
the
government
offered
to
pay
$485,000.00
as
the
fair
market
value
of
the
camps
taken.
respondent,
however,
rejected
the
offer,
claiming
that
the
cost
of
developing
equivalent
camps
at
the
new
site
would
be
something
in
excess
of
$5
million.
respondent
accordingly
asked
the
court
to
rule
that
the
appropriate
standard
was
the
cost
of
constructing
the
new
facilities,
not
the
fair
market
value
of
the
old
facilities.
the
district
court
ruled
against
that
contention.
the
respondent
took
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
that
the
substitute
facility's
measure
of
compensation
is
available
to
private
owners
of
non-profit
community
facilities
in
certain
cases,
as
well
as
to
public
owners,
that
is
governmental
entities,
as
it
had
previously
recognized
--
been
recognized
to
be
available.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
true.
this
court
has
never
endorsed
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine
even
for
public
entities.
the
brown
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
was
a
case
in
which
congress,
after
one
town
was
flooded
by
a
public
project,
congress
appropriated
money
to
condemn
another
area
as
a
substitute
site
and
the
question
was
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
subsequent
taking,
whether
that
was
a
public
use
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
held
that
it
was
and
the
court's
language
talked
about
how
it's
a
reasonable
thing
to
substitute
a
new
town
for
the
old
town,
but
the
question
was
not
the
scope
of
compensation
for
a
taking.
so,
this
court
has
never
approved
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine.
in
any
event,
the
third
circuit
here,
in
its
first
opinion,
said
that
the
doctrine
can
be
applicable
to
a
private
non-profit
entity
in
certain
circumstances.
it
described
the
key
circumstance
as
one
in
which
the
facilities
taken
are
reasonably
necessary
to
public
welfare.
on
remand,
the
trial
was
divided
into
two
phases.
the
issue
in
the
first
phase
was
whether
the
substitute
facility's
measure
of
compensation
applied
to
the
taking
of
these
camps.
after
a
10-day
trial,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict,
by
special
interrogatory,
finding
that
the
doctrine
did
not
apply
here.
the
second
phase
of
the
trial
was
devoted
to
the
issue
of
the
fair
market
value
of
the
condemned
camps.
respondent
sought
to
establish
the
fair
market
value
by
what
is
called
the
cost
approach.
that
is,
the
reproduction
cost
of
the
camps
minus
depreciation.
that
is,
the
reproduction
cost
of
the
buildings
minus
the
depreciation
of
the
buildings
plus
the
value
of
the
underlying
land.
the
government
used
two
evidentiary
approaches
to
show
the
fair
market
value.
one
was,
again,
the
cost
approach
and
the
other
was
the
so-called
market
data
approach,
that
is,
comparable
sales.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
--
an
award
of
$740,000.00
as
the
fair
market
value
of
the
camps
which
was
a
compromise
between
the
positions
taken
by
the
opposing
sides,
which,
of
course
often
happens
in
these
cases.
respondent
then
took
a
second
appeal,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
again.
in
addition
to
finding
error
in
comments
to
the
jury
in
closing,
the
court
held
that
the
district
court's
instructions
on
application
of
the
substitute
facility's
measure
of
compensation
have
been
erroneous.
as
the
court
of
appeals
restated
the
doctrine,
it
has
three
requirements,
the
property
must
be
operated
on
a
not-for-profit
basis,
there
must
be
no
ready
market
for
the
particular
type
of
property,
and
the
facilities
must
be
reasonably
necessary
to
the
public
welfare.
that
is,
i
should
have
made
clear,
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
restatement
of
what
it
held
the
first
time.
the
court
of
appeals
then
went
on
to
elucidate
further
what
it
meant
and,
with
respect
to
the
no-ready-market
test,
for
example,
the
court
held
that
even
if
respondent
could
have
sold
its
camps
and
even
if
they
had
a
fair
market
value,
as
the
jury
had
found
that
they
did,
this
condition
of
the
substitute
facilities
test
was
met
if
respondent
could
not
have
replaced
the
camps
in
the
market
place
for
a
cost
roughly
equal
to
their
fair
market
value.
with
respect
to
the
third
condition
that
the
facility
be
reasonably
necessary
to
the
public
welfare,
the
majority
explained
that
what
it
meant
by
this
was
not
really
necessity,
but
simply
that
the
condemned
facility
must
“provide
a
benefit
to
the
community
that
will
not
be
as
fully
provided
after
the
facility
is
taken.”
thus,
the
court
gave
as
an
example,
if
the
camps
here
did,
as
respondent
contended,
help
to
reduce
juvenile
crime
by
taking
some
youngsters
from
inner
city
philadelphia
and,
thus,
helping
to
alleviate
the
gang
problem
in
inner
city
philadelphia.
then,
the
court
said
these
camps
will
provide
to
the
entire
community
of
eastern
pennsylvania,
not
just
to
the
campers.
judge
stern
concurred
in
the
opinion
under
compulsion
of
the
court's
earlier
opinion,
but
his
opinion
is
essentially
a
dissent
on
the
merits.
judge
rosen
dissented
but,
from
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
earlier
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial
pursuant
to
its
newly
articulated
standards
and,
at
that
point,
this
court
intervened
by
granting
certiorari.
well,
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine
with
which
we
deal
here
and
which,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
this
court
has
never
approved
is,
in
any
event,
an
exception
to
what
this
court
has
made
clear
is
the
standard
method
of
computing
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
method,
of
course,
if
fair
market
value.
the
court
has
defined
just
compensation
as
the
full
monetary
equivalent
of
the
property
taken
in
the
reynolds
case
and,
as
stated
in
almota,
the
court
earlier
established
the
concept
of
market
value.
the
owner
is
entitled
to
the
fair
market
value
of
his
property
at
the
time
of
taking.
now,
the
court
has
also
made
clear
that
where
the
property
is
so
special
that
market
data,
such
as
comparable
sales,
may
be
few,
resort
must
be
had
to
other
data
to
ascertain
its
value,
this
is
the
miller
case.
and,
those
other
approaches
are,
for
one,
the
income
approach,
capitalization
of
net
income,
which
can
be
used
for
business
properties,
or
the
cost
approach,
reproduction
cost
minus
depreciation,
which
in
fact
was
used
here
in
the
fair
market
value
aspect
of
the
trial.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
it
will
not
be,
and
nobody
--
(voice
overlap)
--
and
nobody
suggested
that
that
approach
be
used
here,
mr.
chief
justice.
but,
the
court
has
indicated
that
these
approaches
“may
have
relevance
but
only,
of
course,
as
bearing
on
what
a
prospective
purchaser
would
have
paid.”
they
are
all
approaches
that
are
designed
to
determine
fair
market
value.
now,
the
difference
with
the
substituted
facilities
doctrine
is
that
it
concedingly
is
not
a
method
of
determining
value
at
all.
it
is
--
or
at
least
certainly
not
fair
market
value.
it
is
a
completely
different
avenue.
as
the
respondents
here
--
as
respondent
here
says
in
its
brief
at
page
23,
the
doctrine
is
not
used
in
conjunction
with
the
market
value
approach
evaluation
but
as
an
alternative
to
it.
and,
thus,
the
difference
which
is
indicated
by
the
facts
of
this
case
where
the
fair
market
value
was
found
to
be
$740,000.00
and
yet,
respondent
claims
that
the
cost
of
substitute
facilities
would
be
$4
million
or
$5
million.
now,
respondent
has
attempted
to
justify
the
use
of
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine
here
on
the
basis
that
this
case
is
unique
or
at
least
very,
very
special,
that
it
is
a
situation
that
arises
infrequently.
what
is
rare
about
it?
well,
respondent
says
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
property's
chief
value
is
in
its
use,
not
its
status
in
the
marketplace.
and
this
theme
that
the
true
value
of
this
property
is
in
its
use
and
that
that
makes
this
case
very
rare
and
different
recurs
throughout
respondent's
brief.
in
the
first
place,
we're
not
sure
what
this
means,
that
the
true
value
is
in
its
use.
it
may
means
simply
that
the
property
is
adopted
for
a
particular
use,
in
this
case,
camps,
and
that
makes
it
particularly
valuable.
if
that
is
all
it
means,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
it
whatever.
it
is
what
this
court
has
said,
for
example,
in
the
mitchell
case.
well,
if
it
means
more
than
that,
we
see
nothing
so
rare
about
this
case
and
no
justification
here
for
deviating
from
the
principles
of
fair
market
value
that
this
court
has
laid
down.
if
it
simply
means
that
there
is
a
disparity
here,
as
respondent
emphasizes,
between
what
the
property
owned
would
be
seen
by
way
of
fair
market
value
and
what
the
property
owner
needs
in
order
to
preserve
the
use
to
which
the
property
was
devoted,
well,
that
happens
very
commonly.
it
often
happens
that
a
property
may
be
--
may
suffice
for
its
owner's
use,
even
be
uniquely
well
adapted
for
that
use
and
yet,
when
it's
condemned,
the
fair
market
value
fall
short
of
what
the
owner
would
have
to
pay
to
acquire
a
property
equally
suitable
for
carrying
on
that
use.
it
may
happen,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
an
old
factory
specially
adapted
for
the
owner's
use.
for
example,
in
the
certain
property
in
manhattan
case,
306
f.2d
439,
one
of
the
issues
involved
the
printing
plant
of
a
newspaper,
il
progreso,
in
manhattan
which
was
an
old
printing
plant
but
very
well
adapted
to
putting
out
this
particular
newspaper.
however,
the
evidence
was
that
if
anybody
bought
the
property,
they
would
tear
the
building
down
and
use
it
for
something
else,
that
is,
it
--
the
fair
market
value
of
the
structure
as
a
printing
plant
was
nil,
and
the
court
held
that
there
would
be
no
compensation
for
that
structure.
and,
that
is
one
example.
another
example
would
be
an
old
and
man-shackled
house,
very
commodious,
very
convenient
for
the
family
living
in
it,
but
if
the
house
were
condemned,
its
age
--
and
i
suppose
we're
not
talking
about
a
house
in
washington,
d.c.
but
elsewhere,
its
age
might
bring
it
a
reduced
price
on
the
market
which
would
not
suffice
to
buy
a
new
house
or
any
house
of
equal
size
and
convenience.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
i
guess,
that
would
be
true.
the
--
similar
with
an
old
church,
the
fair
market
value
might
be
insufficient
to
purchase
a
new
church
equally
suitable
to
the
needs
of
the
congregation.
on
the
other
hand,
it
might
not
be
the
case.
the
reproduction
cost
of
the
old
church,
if
it's
not
a
worn
out
old
church,
but
a
well-preserved
old
church,
the
reproduction
cost
conceivably
could
be
higher
than
the
cost
of
building
a
new
plastic
church.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes.
indeed,
this
follows
almost
necessarily
from
the
consideration
of
the
depreciation
and
new
regulatory
requirements.
the
old
building
is
going
to
have
depreciated
and
it
is
going
to
follow
almost
necessarily
that
a
new
building
will
cost
more.
also,
if
there
are
new
regulatory
requirements,
as
one
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
we
do
--
we're
not
sure
that
they
do
it
at
all,
mr.
justice
stevens.
they
have
said
in
their
brief
--
they
have
said
that
if
there
are
what
they
call
maintenance
and
capital
savings
from
the
new
camp,
they
should
be
deducted
from
the
rewa
--
from
the
award.
we're
not
sure
what
they
mean
by
maintenance
and
capital
savings.
if
they
meant
depreciation
cost,
one
would've
thought
they
would
say
so,
but
that
certainly
was
not
their
position
below.
even
the
trial
court,
as
we
explained
in
our
reply
brief,
they
argue
precisely
for
the
entire
cost
of
constructing
these
camps,
as
testified
to
by
their
expert,
without
any
depreciation.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
we
still
would
object
to
it.
but,
it's
--
it's
noteworthy
that
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine,
as
applied
to
public
entities,
more
often
than
not
has
been
applied
without
a
deduction
for
depreciation.
and
the
trial
court
here
so-ruled,
at
page
650
of
the
transcript,
the
court,
after
stating
the
synod
argues
that
depreciation
cannot
be
concerted
in
a
substitute
facilities
evaluation,
that's
page
657,
the
court
went
on
to
rule
at
page
650,
“i
think
that
the
depreciation
is
not
a
proper
deduction
for
taking
a
public
property
and,
therefore,
it
should
not
be
permitted
when
it
is
private.”
and,
indeed,
if
the
purpose
of
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine
is
to
allow
substitution,
replacement
of
the
facility,
it
is
certainly
arguable
that
that
purpose
is
frustrating.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
one
certainly
could
say
that.
we
would
say
that
you
are
entitled
only
to
the
fair
market
value
of
what
you
have
and
you
are
not
entitled
to
replacement
at
all.
one
reason
for
that
is
the
tremendous
--
and
a
point
that
we
--
that
has
not
really
been
emphasized
so
far
in
this
case
is
the
tremendous
flexibility
and
leeway
that
comes
in
by
way
of
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine.
it
is
suppose
to
be
a
functional
equivalent
substitute
facility.
and
this
case
well
illustrate
how
much
flexibility
can
come
in
there.
for
example,
here,
respondent
had
300
acres
of
flat
land
along
the
river
where
its
camps
were
located.
it
went
out
and
bought
3,800
acres
of
wooded
hilly
land
on
which
the
only
water
was
a
creek.
thus,
in
order
to
functionally
equivalent
aquatic
facilities,
it
is
necessary
to
dam
the
creek
to
create
a
small
lake
for
which
respondent
would
have
$1
million
to
build
the
dam.
respondent
wants
three
beaches
to
put
in
on
the
small
lake.
respondent
has
to
build
a
bridge
to
get
over
the
new
lake.
the
old
camps
were
on
a
public
road.
respondent
has
to
build
a
new
access
road
of
1.6
miles
to
get
to
the
new
camp
plus
substantial
interior
road
facilities.
the
trial
court
charged
that
this
was
all
alright,
that
so
long
as
the
jury
found
that
the
new
camp
was
adequate,
that
the
new
site
was
adequate
to
respondent's
needs,
the
cost
resulting
from
new
conditions
at
the
site
should
be
taken
into
account
in
computing
the
cost
of
substitute
facilities,
and
that
is
the
one
of
the
huge
reasons
for
the
difference
between
reproduction
cost
of
the
old
facilities
and
the
cost
of
substitute
facilities.
well,
respondent
argues
that
the
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
private
facilities
and
asks
to
put
a
hard
case.
why
should
it
be
that
when
a
city
takes
--
or
when
the
united
states
government
takes
a
city
school,
a
public
school,
the
city
is
compensated
with
the
cost
of
constructing
a
new
school,
but
if
the
city
were
to
take
a
parochial
school
right
across
the
street,
the
non-profit
church
that
owns
the
parochial
school
would
not
be
entitled
to
such
compensation
but
only
to
the
fair
market
value?
well,
we
think
there
are
a
number
of
explanations,
even
assuming
that
the
doctrine
should
be
applied
to
the
public
facility
in
the
first
place
or
even
assuming
that
it
should
be
applied
in
particular
to
public
facilities
like
schools
for
which
fair
market
values
can
be
established
as
distinguished
from
where
the
doctrine
started,
streets
and
highways
which
had
no
fair
market
value.
for
one
thing,
the
public
entity
is
often
under
--
the
assumption
in
the
case
of
the
public
entity
for
the
doctrine
being
applied
is
that
it
is
under
a
requirement
to
replace
the
facility.
now,
this
requirement
can
be
legally
enforced
in
various
ways
in
the
case
of
the
public
entity.
now,
it
is
true
that
a
private
entity,
such
as
the
church,
may
say
that
it
too
is
required
to
replace
its
school.
it
needs
its
school
for
its
purposes.
it
has
children
who
are
attending
the
condemned
school,
and
so
forth.
one
answer
is
that
in
the
--
one
difference
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
public
entity
the
requirement
is
legally
enforceable.
a
further
answer
is
that
if
simply
need
to
replace
is
the
test,
why
stop
with
private
non-profit
entities?
a
business
firm
which
has
its
only
establishment
taken,
its
only
manufacturing
establishment,
its
only
sales
establishment
is
surely
under
as
much
factory
need
to
replace
it
as
a
non-profit
entity
would
be
or
as
a
government
would
be
and,
yet,
no
one
has
suggested
that
all
this
court's
prior
ruling
should
be
thrown
out
and
substitute
facilities
be
substituted
across
the
board
for
the
fair
market
value
test.
a
third
difference
is
that
if
the
facility
is
not
in
fact
constructed
with
the
substitute
facilities
award
or
if
it
is
constructed
and
subsequently
sold
or
devoted
to
another
purpose,
in
the
case
of
the
public
facility
area,
the
assurance
is
that
only
the
public
will
benefit
from
the
money
in
any
event,
whereas,
in
the
case
of
the
non-profit
private
facility,
one
cannot
have
that
assurance.
a
further
difference
is
the
need
for
a
very
difficult
task
of
devising
standards
that
arises
once
one
goes
beyond
public
facilities,
and
that
difficulty
is
well
illustrated
by
this
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
first
said
the
standard
was
whether
the
non-profit
facility
was
reasonably
necessary.
then,
as
to
the
jury's
negative
verdict,
the
court
relaxed
its
standard
and
said
the
test
is
whether
the
facility
provides
the
community
benefit.
and,
when
we
pointed
out
some
of
the
difficulties
in
determining
what's
the
community
and
what's
the
benefit,
respondent
now
does
not
defend
the
court
of
appeals
latest
opinion
either
and
respondent
simply
contends
that
all
non-profit
entities
are
entitled
so
long
as
their
facility
is
devoted
to
any
religious
public
charitable
or
educational
purpose.
the
problem
with
that
is
it
would
cost
a
lot
of
money,
for
one
thing,
and
we
find
it
hard
to
find
in
the
constitution
anything
that
says
all
non-profit
entities
are
entitled
by
constitutional
command
to
the
substitute
facility's
measure
of
compensation,
whereas,
profit
entities
are
not.
in
addition
to
--
so,
those
are
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
if
the
doctrine
is
to
be
recognized
at
all,
that
it's
a
very
good
reason
for
limiting
it
to
public
governmental
entities.
finally,
there
are
in
this
case
the
first
amendment
problems
that
we
have
--
had
noted
where
a
church
is
concerned.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
oh,
i
think
it's
in
the
courts,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
a
constitutional
requirement,
which
i
think
the
courts
have
authority
to
--
that
is,
the
constitutional
requirement
of
just
compensation,
i
think,
is
in
the
province
of
the
court
to
delineate.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
court
could
say
that,
but
it
will
be
inconsistent
with
what
the
court
has
said.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
in
--
in
the
recent
budcore
case,
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
said
something
very
much
like
that,
that
our
duty
in
just
--
in
eminent
domain
cases
is
to
do
justice.
this
court
reversed
saying,
among
other
things,
the
one
principle
to
which
it
has
always
adhered
is
that
compensation
is
for
the
property
and
not
to
the
owner.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
congress
can
add
to
the
compensation
to
be
provided.
congress
has
done
so
in
the
uniform
location
act,
for
example,
but
i
think
congress
could
not
take
away
from
what
this
court
decided
was
required
by
the
constitution
as
just
compensation.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
enlargement
certainly
could
be
done
by
congress
or
by
state
legislatures.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that's
a
difficult
question.
in
a
federal
taking,
i
would
suggest
perhaps
not.
in
a
state
taking
where
the
forth
amend
--
fourteenth
amendment
is
the
vehicle,
perhaps
it
will
have
more
leeway.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
not
that
i
know
of.
yes,
i
meant
a
state
taking
of
private
property.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
there
may
be
a
market
for
college
type
facilities
for
campuses
in
isolated
areas.
businesses
use
them.
all
sorts
of
schools,
other
than
colleges,
use
them.
all
sorts
of
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no
and,
in
such
a
case,
you
have
to
look
further.
the
newton
girl
scouts
case,
which
is
cited
by
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
in
the
appendix,
makes
clear
that
when
you
have
a
fairly
special
kind
of
facility,
you
may
have
to
look
across
the
country
rather
than
just
in
the
neighborhood,
but
it
doesn't
--
and
you
may
have
to
wait
longer
to
get
a
purchaser.
it
doesn't
follow
that
there's
no
market
at
all
for
the
facility.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
there
may
be
--
it
may
not
be
terribly
active
but,
certainly,
the
land
is
marketable
and
the
buildings,
depending
on
how
many
other
things
they're
suitable
for,
there
are
all
sorts
of
conference
centers
and
retreats
these
days
that
thrive
on
being
in
isolated
places.
so,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
we
put
in
testimony
showing
that,
indeed,
there
were,
that
there
had
been
11
comparable
sales
within
a
7-year-period
in
this
very
county
of
camps.
of
course,
that
evidence
was
disputed.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
think
so.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
just
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may.
my
brother's
key
argument
for
the
applicability
of
the
substitute
facilities
doctrine
here
to
an
entity
like
the
synod
for
this
camps
is
that,
as
he
says,
public
benefits
are
presumed
from
the
fact
that
the
facility
has
run
on
a
non-profit
basis
and
devoted
to
a
charitable,
educational,
or
religious
purpose.
now,
i'm
not
clear
from
his
position
whether
the
reliance
is
on
the
public
benefit
that
these
camps
are
said
to
provide
or
whether
it
is
simply
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
religious
institution
and
anything
done
by
this
religious
institution
would
qualify.
some
of
his
language
would
cut
either
way,
but
if
it's
the
public
benefit,
then
we
see
these
problems
under
the
first
amendment.
this
is
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
that's
it.
if
he
is
then
relying
on
the
good
works,
the
public
benefit
that
these
camps
provide
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
to
that
extent,
it
is
similar
to
the
benefit
to
the
community
test
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
see
those
problems
with
that
under
the
first
amendment.
it
has
the
court
involved
in
determining
whether
what
a
religious
entity
does
provides
a
community
benefit
or
not.
in
the
walz
case,
397
u.s.
at
664,
this
court
said
something
very
apropos
to
that.
“we
find
it
unnecessary
to
justify
the
tax
exemption
on
the
social
welfare
services
or
good
works
that
some
churches
perform
for
parishioners
or
others
to
give
emphasis
to
so
variable
in
aspect
to
the
work
of
religious
bodies
will
introduce
an
element
of
governmental
evaluation
and
standards
as
to
the
worth
of
particular
social
welfare
programs."
if,
on
the
other
hand,
my
brother's
position
is,
and
that's
what
the
language
in
their
reply
brief
would
imply,
that
any
religious
purpose
qualifies,
then,
they
are
saying
that
simply
because
of
the
church
doing
something
religious,
it
qualifies
and
it
wouldn't
matter
then
whether
these
camps
were
converted
into
purely
religious
facilities
or
not.
now,
on
that
basis,
we
have
the
constitutional
problem
that
the
award
here
on
a
substitute
facilities
basis
of
much
more
than
the
fair
market
of
the
camps
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
differences
between
the
tax
exemption
created
by
a
legislature
and
this
court
saying
that
this
is
what
the
fifth
amendment
requires
and
that
the
fifth
amendment
draws
that
line
between
non-profit
entities
and
profit-making
entities.
the
analogy
is
not
the
walz
case,
but
tilton
versus
richardson
or
the
nyquist
case.
in
both
of
those
cases,
this
court
struck
down.
in
tilton,
it
struck
down
unanimously
the
federal
aid
grants
for
the
construction
of
facilities
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
we
would
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
we
would
suggest
that,
here,
when
the
award
would
be
so
much
more
than
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property,
that
it
would
amount
to
more
than
compensation.
it
would
amount
to
a
giving
and
that,
on
that
basis,
it
would
have
constitutional
problems
when
the
recipient
is
a
religious
institution
and
the
facility
could
be
engaged
on
the
second
theory
entirely
on
a
religious
function.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
if
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
but
their
theory
for
getting
the
4
or
5
million
is
that
they
would
stay
in
the
same
business.
that
is
under
--
at
least
under
the
court
of
appeals
approach,
that
is
the
premise
on
which
they
would
be
given
a
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
that's
precisely
our
point,
that
we
could
not
hold
them
to
that
if
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
because
under
the
court
of
appeals
theory
that
would
be
the
basis
for
giving
him
that
amount
of
money
so
that
the
camps
could
continue
to
function.
we
do
not
espouse
that.
we
say
the
government
should
not
be
involved
in
trying
to
monitor
what
a
church
does
with
its
money.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
thank
you.
