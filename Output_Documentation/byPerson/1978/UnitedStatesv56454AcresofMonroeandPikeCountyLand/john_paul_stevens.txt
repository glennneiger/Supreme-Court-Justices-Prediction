i
suppose,
mr.
barnett,
you
take
the
same
position
with
regard
to
an
old
church,
too.
say,
this
had
been
a
church
instead
of
a
camp.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
as
i
understand
their
test,
it's
substitution
cost
less
depreciation.
they
do
would
allow
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
still
object
to
the
alternative
approach
even
if
they
did
allow
a
factor
for
depreciation
or
betterment
in
the
insurance
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
ultimate
purpose
is
to
provide
just
compensation
as
required
by
the
constitution
and
it
--
and
one
could
say
that
that
means
you've
got
to
have
full
compensation
and
able
to
replace
it,
but
you're
not
entitled
to
a
profit
on
the
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hess,
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
doctrine
would
apply
to
a
government-owned
piece
of
property,
such
as
a
camp?
as
i
understand,
there
is
some
argument
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
in
the
lower
courts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
is
the
same
uniformity
of
that
category
of
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hess,
on
your
emphasis
on
the
justice,
which
of
course
is
the
bottom
line
in
a
case
like
this,
is
it
really
just,
if
your
view
is
correct,
to
treat
a
profit
corporation,
take
--
give
it
$700,000.00
when
it
cost
it
$5
million
to
stay
in
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
let's
take
this
example.
supposing
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
is
$700,000.00,
but
the
earnings
of
this
camp
are
enough
to
justify
a
$5-million
investment,
but
it
just
doesn't
have
it.
it
just
--
what
should
be
paid
in
that
case,
just
the
700,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
want
to
try
and
think
it
through
in
terms
of
a
profit-making
corporation.
assume
that
they're
a
very,
very
profitable
camp,
but
there
only
has
a
--
the
real
estate
only
has
a
fair
market
value
of
$700,000.00.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
all
the
comparable
sales
were
at
700,000?
