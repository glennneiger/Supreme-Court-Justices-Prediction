justice
thurgood
marshall
could
they
set
the
guidelines?
that's
--
that's
where
i
get
in
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
were
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hess,
i
agree
on
tax
exemption
and
all
those
things
but,
here,
you're
asking
the
government
to
give
you
some
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
asking
the
government
to
give
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
given
--
you're
asking
the
government
to
give
you
the
difference
between
740,000
and
3
million.
that's
what
you're
asking
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
dollars
and
cents,
what
you're
asking?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
asking
for
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
should
the
federal
government
be
moved
eminent
domain,
while
we're
at
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
say
it's
just
like
a
county,
or
a
city,
or
anything
else,
but
you
don't
have
eminent
domain.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
have
anything
close
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
still
want
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
just
compensation
is
in
dollars
and
cents?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
asked
the
government
giving
that
money
to
church.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
i
said,
does
that
mean
that
the
government
will
be
giving
the
church
that
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
lutheran
church
that
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
who
should
be
getting
the
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
the
difference
is
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
same
amount
of
40.
i'm
talking
about
the
difference
of
740
and
5
million.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
guess
to
the
millions,
it's
millions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
might
stay
on
it,
but
they
might
not
stay
in
the
same
business.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
can
give
them
the
740,000
and
they
could
stop
the
business,
couldn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
you
could
hold
them
to
that.
how
long
you
can
hold
them
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
does
he
have
a
right
to?
