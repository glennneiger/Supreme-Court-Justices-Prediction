--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
fundamental
change
between
35
and
now?
there's
no
change
at
all,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
in
the
whole
factual
situation,
it
said
that
there's
more
money
involved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
relationship
between
new
york
and
the
labor
market,
and
the
federal
government
and
the
labor
market,
is
the
same
as
there
was
in
'35,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
this
we're
in
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
not
selling
apples
yet.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
that
means
seriously
the
relationship,
this
whole
point
was
considered
in
'35.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
understood.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
understood
that
the
management
would
pick
up
this
bill?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wasn't
understood
in
'35?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
understood
in
'35?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
right,
so
'36?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
'37?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
what
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
that
way,
ever
since?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
congress
has
known
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
bothered
to
let
congress
know
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
bothered
to
let
congress
know
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
your
client
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
second
circuit
relied
on
that
very
case,
didn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
second
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case
relied
on
the
lodge
'76
case,
did
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
that
i
knew
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
your
view
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
state
of
adopt
the
law
that
in
any
strike
these
unions
shall
pay
for
the
loss
of
management?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
in
any
strike,
during
the
time
of
the
strike,
the
union
shall
pay
management
its
losses,
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
suppose
the
new
york
states
said
that
where
there
is
a
strike,
the
management
shall
contribute
to
the
unemployment
insurance,
whatever
amount
there
is
left
over
what
they
lose
in
the
strike.
justice
thurgood
marshall
fund.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
just
trying
to
get
something
that
has
something
to
do
with
unemployment,
and
i
assume
financing
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
you
need
to
take
the
position
of
the
states,
are
left
free
to
do
whatever
they
please.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
what
you
keep
saying,
you
don't
need
it
for
this
case,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then,
why
keep
pushing
for
it?
