justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
benetar.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
this
were
unemployment
benefits
for
a
lock
out
that
was
called
by
the
employer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
benetar,
what
percent
of
the
wages
that
a
person
earns
is
paid
by
unemployment
compensation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supremacy
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
the
extent
that
congress
required
the
states
to
pay
unemployment
compensation
to
an
unemployed
person
who
refused
to
cross
a
picket
line,
they
did
then
insert
themselves
in
a
certain
extent
into
the
or
perhaps
a
better
way
to
put
it
is,
they
required
the
states
to
insert
themselves
into
the
economic
warfare.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
moved
the
other
way
from
the
recommendation
of
the
president's
committee.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
they
moved
only
a
slight
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
labor
disputes
under
that
are
governed
by
the
railway
labor
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
one
of
them
that
you've
just
point
out
that's
quite
different
is
that
congress
requires
the
payment
of
benefit
--
unemployment
benefits
to
striking
railroad
workers,
whereas
it
doesn't
to
striking
workers
in
other
areas.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
that's
the
issue
in
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
what
you're
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
basically
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
district
court's
findings
are
correct
and
therefore,
we
will
not
review
them
on
a
clearly
erroneous
basis.
we
nonetheless
find
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
can
be
one
of
economic
fact
though,
can
it?
