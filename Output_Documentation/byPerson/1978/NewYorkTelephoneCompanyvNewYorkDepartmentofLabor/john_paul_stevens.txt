justice

paul

mr.
benetar,
to
distinguish
welfare,
what
would
you
do
if
you
had
unemployment
compensation
financed
by
the
state,
$49
million
paid
by
the
state,
instead
of
the
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
was
financed
by
the
state
for
general
revenues
rather
than
by
the
employer,
would
your
case
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
at
that
time,
mr.
benetar,
had
the
rule
of
neutrality
ever
really
been
discussed
by
congress?wasn't
that
something
that
court
found
a
few
years
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
isn't
much
legislative
history
discussing
the
rule
of
neutrality,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
your
opponent
thinks
that
new
york
and
rhode
island
have
an
unreasonable
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
fair
statement
of
their
position.
they
relied
very
heavily
on
the
trial
court
findings
that
here
there's
an
actual
impact
on
the
bargaining
positions
of
their
respective
parties.
it
seems
to
me
that
consistently
with
that
view,
they
admit
for
example,
welfare
payments
are
all
right,
that
there
could
be
lesser
amounts
of
money,
something
much
less
than
$40
million
--
$49
million,
they
would
not
tip
the
scales,
and
i
don't
think
they're
argument
goes
to
sort
of
an
automatic
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
extent
of
neutrality
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
can
see
welfare
benefits
are
all
right,
i
don't
know
why
they
wouldn't
concede
unemployment
benefits
of
no
greater
amount
or
something
like
that
wouldn't
also
be
fair.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
well,
even
if
they
concede,
then
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
much
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
we
have
to
do
decide
when
there
is
admitted,
you
don't
deny
the
finding
of
a
national
impact
in
the
bargaining
process.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
take
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
one
step
further.
in
the
briefs
the
government
filed,
they
give
you
the
hypothetical
example
of
requiring
100%
of
the
wages
during
the
period
of
the
strike,
and
they
seem
to
say
that
would
be
pre-empted,
a
statute
that
provide
it,
would
you
agree
with
that
concession
by
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
new
york
telephone
company
case,
the
question
is
whether
federal
law
prohibits
the
state
of
new
york
from
paying
unemployment
compensation
to
strikers.
the
case
arises
out
of
the
prolonged
strike
against
the
new
york
telephone
company
by
members
of
the
communication
workers
of
america.
during
a
period
of
approximately
five
months,
the
state
paid
weekly
benefits
averaging
roughly
$75
a
week
per
employee
to
about
33,000
striking
employees.
because
the
state's
unemployment
compensation
program
is
largely
financed
by
taxes
assessed
against
employers,
most
of
the
$49
million
in
benefits
was
ultimately
paid
by
the
company.
petitioner,
the
new
york
telephone
company,
brought
this
action
against
the
new
york
state
department
of
labor
and
its
responsible
officials
seeking
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
new
york
statute
and
award
recovering
the
increased
taxes
paid
as
a
result
of
the
disbursement
of
benefits
to
striking
employees.
after
an
eight-day
trial,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
found
that
the
payment
of
benefits
had
a
measurable
impact
favorable
to
the
union
on
the
progress
of
the
strike,
concluded
that
the
new
york
program
violated
the
federal
labor
policy
of
neutrality
in
collective
bargaining
and
granted
relief
to
the
company.
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed.
that
court
held
that
congress
had
not
expressly
forbidden
state
unemployment
compensation
for
strikers
and
after
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
title
ix
of
the
social
security
act
concluded
that
congress
did
not
implicitly
prohibit
the
states
from
paying
this
kind
of
compensation
to
striking
employees.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
issue,
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
reasons
for
the
court's
conclusions
are
set
forth
in
three
separate
opinions.
i
would
only
say
about
those
reasons
that
they
make
it
clear
that
the
question
is
not
a
constitutional
question
but
rather
is
a
question
of
what
congress
has
intended
in
the
various
--
in
the
relevant
statutes
that
it
has
enacted.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
joined
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart
have
joined.
