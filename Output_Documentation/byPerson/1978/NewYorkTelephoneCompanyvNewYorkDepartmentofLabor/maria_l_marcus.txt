ms.
maria
l.
marcus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
maria
l.
marcus,
special
assistant
attorney
general
representing
respondents
here.
pre-emption
is
a
doctrine
designed
to
give
effect
to
congressional
intent
not
to
overcome
it.
and
as
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
points
out,
the
key
to
that
intent
is
in
the
social
security
act,
not
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
for
the
nlra
contains
no
specific
direction,
as
to
the
extent
to
which
states
are
permitted
to
regulate
labor
management
controversies.
now,
when
congress
faces
up
to
the
pre-emption
question,
in
enacting
second
law,
this
court
has
looked
to
the
more
pertinent
federal
provision
in
disposing
in
pre-emption
claims.
most
recent
example
of
this
was
in
malone
versus
white
motor
corporation
where
the
employer,
like
petitioners
here,
argued
that
the
nlra's
policy
of
free
collective
bargaining
was
absolute.
and
that
therefore,
the
state's
statute
there
which
actually
altered
the
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
must
violate
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
and
be
struck
down.
but,
this
court
upheld
the
state's
right
to
act,
pointing
to
the
welfare
of
pension
plans
disclosure
act
as
a
better
indicia
of
congressional
intent.
now,
petitioners
here
say
that
this
court
should
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
general
pre-emption
principles
derived
from
the
nlra
hold
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
give
unemployment
benefits
to
strikers.
now,
congress
directly
faced
this
question
in
enacting
the
social
security
act
and
it
decided
that
with
three
very
narrow
exceptions
that
the
state
was
free
to
grant
such
benefits
or
to
refuse
to
do
so.
social
security
act
received
its
impetus
as
this
court
has
recognized
from
the
president's
committee
on
economic
security,
whose
advisory
counsel
said,
when
you
enact
the
social
security
act,
don't
let
the
states
pay
unemployment
benefits
to
strikers.
senator
wagner,
who
was
the
sponsor
of
both
nlra
and
the
social
security
act
and
was
also
the
first
witness
in
the
hearings
on
this
social
security
act,
took
a
different
view.
he
said,
there
should
be
practically
no
restrictions
on
the
states,
in
the
kind
of
programs
that
they
can
write.
now,
congress
ultimately
did
pass
some
restrictions,
dealing
with
the
payment
of
unemployment
compensation
during
strikes,
but
aside
from
those
restrictions,
consciously
left
the
rest
to
the
states
for
determination.
it
was
extremely
important
at
that
time
that
all
the
states
pass
unemployment
compensation
laws,
because
if
they
didn't,
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
would
have
been
frustrated.
and
to
make
sure
that
all
the
states
came
into
the
field,
congress
enacted
extremely
strong
and
elaborate
incentives
to
induce
the
states
to
come
in.
the
senate
finance
committee
report
in
explaining
the
approach
of
congress
passing
the
social
security
act
said
that
they
wanted
the
states
to
proceed
without
dictation
from
washington
and
they
recognized
new
york,
whose
statute
was
already
in
existence
and
substantially
the
same
form,
as
we
have
it
today,
as
one
of
the
kinds
of
laws
that
they
sought
to
encourage
the
other
states
to
pass.
now,
as
far
as
the
experience
rating
aspect,
which
counsel
has
referred,
which
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
about,
the
fact
is
that
on
the
face
of
new
york's
law
it
was
already
indicated
that
new
york
was
contemplating
passing
such
a
provision,
and
what's
more
important,
congress
itself
wanted
all
the
states
to
have
experience
rating
provisions
and
included
incentives
to
persuade
the
states
to
put
experience
rating
into
all
their
law,
so
they
wanted
the
states
to
proceed
on
that
basis.
the
social
security
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
were
passed
during
the
same
five-week
period,
by
the
same
congress
sitting
in
the
same
session.
now,
there
is
no
pre-emption,
there
is
not
a
vestige
of
support
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
any
such
pre-emption.
the
national
labor
relations
board
choose
the
agency
in
charge
of
interpreting
and
enforcing
the
law,
said
that
there
is
no
pre-emption
here,
as
does
the
united
states
of
america,
who
has
come
in
on
the
same
brief,
as
amicus
curiae
in
this
court.
the
question
of
pre-emption
is
not
as
counsel
has
been
indicating
a
constitutional
principle.
this
court
said
in
retail
clerks
versus
schermerhorn
that
pre-emption
is
merely
a
rationalization
of
the
co-existence
of
federal
and
state
agencies
in
the
same
labor
relations
field,
it's
not
a
constitutional
principle
at
all.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
becomes
a
constitutional
matter
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
if
the
two
laws
are
inconsistent,
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
--then
the
federal
law
is
stronger,
but
what
the
court
--
i
believe
what
this
court
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
right,
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution,
but
this
what
this
court
meant
in
stating,
directly
stating,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
decision
of
that
pre-emption
is
not
a
constitutional
principle,
it
simply
meant
that
the
idea
of
not
having
the
states
in
the
field
at
all
is
not
part
of
the
pre-emption
concept.
the
pre-emption
concept
simply
points
to
what
congress
had
in
mind,
congress,
the
ultimate
top
stone
of
deciding
whether
in
fact
it
wishes
to
have
some
states
regulation,
have
a
great
deal
or
to
have
none
at
all.
now,
in
the
social
security
act,
the
incentives
that
i
referred
to
were
a
really
very
strong
either/or,
and
to
give
you
the
idea
of
what
that
either/or
was.
for
the
states
that
refused
to
pass
a
law,
this
is
what
would
happen.
their
employers
would
have
to
pay
a
3%
payroll
tax
on
a
portion
of
the
salaries
of
all
their
employees
and
that
money
would
never
be
returned
to
the
states
in
any
form,
but
would
simply
go
to
the
federal
government,
in
fact
support
unemployment
insurance
programs
in
other
states.
that's
what
would
happen
if
the
state
refuse
to
pass
an
unemployment
compensation
law.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
passed
one,
each
employer
would
receive
a
90%
tax
credit,
which
he
would
receive
merely
by
virtue
of
paying
the
state
tax,
whatever
that
state
tax
was,
when
the
state
tax
was
at
the
maximum
that
the
state
set
or
nothing
at
all,
he
would
still
receive
that
90%
tax
credit.
and
the
other
10%,
which
was
not
wiped
out
by
the
credit,
would
in
any
event
be
returned
to
the
states
either
to
support
federal
benefits
or
to
help
administer
the
program.
so,
that
was
an
extremely
pervasive
kind
of
incentive,
in
fact
so
much
so
that
the
law
was
challenged.
as
usurping
state
powers,
as
coercing
the
states
to
come
into
the
field.
and
this
court
considered
that
question
in
steward
versus
machine
company
and
it
decided
that
yes,
these
were
very
pervasive
incentives,
but
because
of
the
latitude
given
to
the
states
in
developing
their
own
program,
that
congress
what
entitled
to
keep
those
incentives
in
the
law.
so
that
congress
has
from
the
very
inception
of
both
the
nlra
and
the
social
security
act
considered
the
interrelation
of
unemployment
insurance
and
the
economics
of
labor
disputes
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
from
the
very
beginning,
they
had
what
was
a
strong
and
flat
out
recommendation
by
the
very
group
that
was
the
impetus
for
the
passage
of
the
law.
don't
let
the
states
pay
and
what
congress
did
at
that
point
was
say,
"well,
we're
going
to
look
into
that
area
and
we
will
put
down
some
restrictions
which
they
did
but
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
those
restrictions
for
example
were
that
if
a
worker
refused
to
seek
new
work,
to
accept
new
work
at
a
struck
job
that
he
couldn't
be
denied
unemployment
benefits.
also
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
in
other
words,
the
question
as
to
what
kind
of
new
work,
under
all
unemployment
plans,
under
all
state
laws,
a
person
is
obliged
to
seek
other
work.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
right.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
and
the
--
what
congress
want
to
make
sure
of
is
that
the
state
didn't
say
to
this
worker,
you've
got
a
possible
job,
you
can
go
and
work
at
x
plant,
which
is
being
struck
by
its
employees.
and
congress
said
no.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
you
can't
deny
benefits
to
somebody
because
they
refuse
to
work
for
an
employer
who
was
involved
in
a
labor
controversy.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
and
the
other
restrictions
involved
such
things
as
not
permitting
denial
of
benefits
for
somebody
who
refused
to
work
for
less
than
the
prevailing
wage
in
an
area.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
and
refused
to
join
a
place
where
they
were
not
allowed
to
be
union
members.
so,
those
were
some
of
the
restrictions
which
congress
did
impose,
and
which
were
in
the
area
of
labor
management
controversy,
but
they
refused
to
go
along
where
the
recommendation
of
the
president's
committee,
despite
its
pre-eminent
position
as
the
actual
impetus
of
the
whole
act.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
to
prevent
any
state
plan
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
--
from
paying
under
the
various
options
that
already
exist
from
paying
unemployment
compensation.
and
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
they
certainly
were
thinking
along
the
lines
that
the
president's
committee
asked
them
to
think
along
and
what
they
said
was
we
will
put
this
restriction
on
the
states,
but
we
will
not
put
down
the
flat
restrictions
that
the
president's
committee
asked
us
to
do.
we
will
do
this,
we
will
put
in
this,
that
has
to
do
with
labor
management
controversies,
but
we
won't
go
as
far
as
we're
asked
to
do
and
flatly
prevent
the
state
from
developing
its
own
programs.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
that's
correct.
and
so
we've
got
the
social
security
act,
which
i
think
in
itself
provides
a
basis
for
the
rejection
of
the
pre-emption
claims
here.
but
in
addition,
there
are
others,
an
independent
ground
for
dismissal
of
these
claims.
now,
petitioners
have
said
that
a
uniform
national
standard
on
the
payment
of
unemployment
benefits
during
industrial
controversies
is
essential
to
the
federal
labor
scheme.
now
we've,
congress
thinks
otherwise
and
its
views
rather
than
economic
theory
which
are
controlling.
congress'
view
has
come
out
in
a
variety
of
different
statutes.
now,
we've
noted
that
the
nlra
and
the
social
security
act
were
passed
at
the
same
time,
by
the
same
congress
sitting
in
the
same
session.
in
1947,
there
was
an
attempt
to
amend
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
fact,
the
house
passed
amendments,
which
said
that
any
employee
who
receive
unemployment
compensation,
while
he
was
on
strike
would
be
deprived
of
his
protection
and
status
as
an
employee
under
the
nlra.
now,
house
minority
report
in
commenting
on
that
interestingly
enough
pointed
to
the
social
security
act
as
the
core
of
congress'
intent
on
this
question
and
said,
under
the
social
security
act,
this
matter
has
advisedly
been
left
to
the
states
and
that
was
a
criticism
of
the
house
amendments.
the
senate
refused
to
go
along
with
those
amendments
and
they
were
dropped.
then
in
the
railroad
unemployment
insurance
act
you
have
a
situation,
which
has
lasted
for
more
than
40
years,
where
there
is
a
requirement
of
paying
unemployment
benefits
to
striking
railway
workers.
and
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
amendments
of
that
original
schemes,
amendments
to
raise
the
benefit
levels
and
increase
the
duration
of
paying
benefits,
but
from
its
inception
it
has
been
an
all
employer
financed
scheme.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
they
are
and
while
there
are
some
differences
in
the
structure,
this
court
pointed
out
in
locomotive
engineers
versus
baltimore
and
ohio
that
those
differences
go
to
the
beginning
of
the
labor
dispute,
where
there
are
various
mediation
provisions
which
must
be
followed,
but
that
once
those
initial
stages
are
over,
the
parties
are
in
the
same
position
as
they
are
under
the
nlra,
self-helped
and
collective
bargaining.
so,
there
are
obviously
similar
features
in
both
laws.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
does
not
require
them
your
honor,
but
it
permits
them
under
the
plan
of
the
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes
it
is.
under
the
--
under
the
plan
of
the
social
security
act,
i
think
it
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
what
that
plan
was,
the
plan
was
to
give
permissions
to
the
states,
which
were
plenary
and
general
and
to
spell
out
only
those
few
areas,
in
which
the
states
were
restricted,
that's
how
the
law
is
setup.
it
wasn't
setup
with
you
may
do
this,
and
this,
and
this,
and
this,
and
this
but
rather
because
of
the
need
to
bring
the
state
into
the
field,
the
urgent
federal
state
cooperation
that
was
absolutely
essential
to
the
success
of
the
social
security
act,
the
plan
was
to
make
clear
to
the
states
that
they
had
this
broad
latitude
that
there
would
be
no
dictation
from
washington
and
that
they
would
be
restricted
in
only
a
few
particulars,
all
of
which
was
set
out
in
the
act.
so,
that
was
how
the
act
was
structured.
then
when
congress
considered
the
question
of
food
stamps,
and
whether
they
should
be
granted
to
strikers,
congress
had
another
opportunity
to
look
at
the
relation
of
the
payment
of
public
benefits
and
the
economics
of
labor
disputes,
and
what
they
said
there
was
that
food
stamps
must
be
paid
to
strikers.
and
the
reason
that
they
gave
was
that
to
deny
benefits
would
be
to
take
sides
in
labor
disputes.
so
obviously,
the
idea
of
neutrality
which
petitioners
are
trying
to
present
here
is
quite
different
from
congress'
idea
of
neutrality.
in
afdc-u,
that
is
aid
to
families
of
dependent
children
with
unemployed
fathers,
uniform
definitions
were
established
by
congress
but
the
atw
secretary
under
a
regulation
upheld
by
this
court
did
preserve
local
options
to
the
states,
who
could
take
their
choice
as
to
whether
to
grant
benefits
or
to
refuse
to
do
so.
a
contemporary
congressional
expression
about
the
social
security
act
also
occurred
when
the
nixon
administration
in
the
91st
congress
era
asked
that
the
congress
supply
the
bar
against
striker
benefits,
which
the
petitioners
are
now
asking
from
the
judiciary,
they
said,
don't
let
the
states
pay
unemployment
benefits
to
strikers.
now,
congress
refused
to
go
along
with
that
recommendation
and
representative
mills,
who
was
chairman
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
said
in
floor
debate,
well,
for
example,
there
are
states
that
pay
unemployment
benefits
to
strikers,
i
wouldn't
vote
for
it,
but
if
they
want
to
do
it,
why
shouldn't
they
have
the
latitude
to
write
the
program
they
want.
so,
it's
clear
for
me
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
the
vast
majority
of
states
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
the
vast
majority
of
states
your
honor
do
pay
under
a
variety
of
different
schemes.
some
for
example
pay
if
the
employer
continues
an
operation
during
the
strike.
some
pay
if
there
is
a
strike
protesting
against
hazardous
conditions.
some
pay
if
the
employer
violates
his
own
labor
contract.
some
pay
if
the
employer
violates
federal
labor
law,
some
pay
if
the
employer
violates
state
labor
law.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
i
don't
know
of
--
either
they
have
the
provision
that
we
have,
which
provides
a
suspension
period
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
--
which
eliminates
the
vast
bulk
of
strikes
from
consideration
altogether
or
they
fix
on
particular
circumstances
under
which
the
benefits
should
be
paid,
either
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
in
other
words,
how
many
like
new
york's
law
and
have
the
suspension
period.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
rhode
island
and
possibly
the
virgin
islands,
but
rhode
island
has
a
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
has
our
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
--
suspension
period
approach.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
which
eliminates
the
vast
majority
of
strikes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
correct,
that
hawaii
has
the
same
kind
of
statute
as
this
court
upheld
in
the
kimbell
case,
that
is
if
the
employer
continues
in
substantial
operation,
then
the
benefits
will
be
paid.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
have
this
particular
approach.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
but
pay
nothing
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
during
the
suspension
period,
which
eliminates
most
strikes
from
any
payment
altogether.
whereas,
the
other
schemes
by
enlarge
pay
at
the
outset
of
a
strike
after
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
--the
normal
waiting
period,
after
the
normal
waiting
period,
if
these
circumstances
are
what
the
statute
includes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
our
position
is
that
what
congress
did
in
the
social
security
act
was
to
give
plenary
and
general
permissions
to
the
states
to
develop
whatever
kind
of
program
they
wished
and
what
was
setout
in
the
social
security
act
where
there's
restrictions
and
not
the
permissions.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
the
congress
certainly
didn't
prohibit
any
of
the
possible
options,
but
it
would
be
unfeasible
and
unpolitical
to
have
anything
like
that
happen.
and
i
think
if
it
did,
of
course
congress
would
move
in
as
it
has
left
itself
room
to
do
by
a
provision
in
the
social
security
act
that
says
no
vested
rights
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
i
think
that
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
there
--
congress
did
not
prohibit
whatever
option
the
states
adopt,
however,
i
think
that
the
wisdom
of
congress
in
supposing
that
the
states
will
act
reasonably,
because
the
example
that
your
honor
gives
is
very
unreasonable
and
given
that
policy
but
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
not
that
particular
example,
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
--
but
i
think
that
congress
--
the
confidence
that
congress
had
that
obviously
the
states
would
not
do
something
unreasonable
has
been
justified
by
the
fact
that
in
40
years
in
50
different
states
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
--
nothing
like
that
has
ever
occurred,
no
state
has
ever
passed
on
such
unreasonable
law
and
we've
had
50
jurisdictions
to
experiment
in
and
more
than
40
years
for
that
to
have
happened,
but
in
fact
i
think
the
states
have
justified
congress'
confidence
and
not
having
gone
to
any
such
bad
policy
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
but
the
example
that
mr.
justice
stewart
had
cited
is
very
far
from
anything
that
has
occurred
or
i
think
would
occur.
now,
we
are
looking,
it's
clear
from
the
examples
of
all
these
different
statutes
that
a
uniform
policy
on
the
payment
of
unemployment
benefits
to
strikers
is
not
essential
to
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
that
congress
has
repeatedly
said
so,
and
indicated
so.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
we
are
looking
in
presenting
this
legislative
history
to
this
court
at
the
same
kind
of
documents,
the
same
kind
of
amendments,
refusals
to
amend,
specific
legislative
reports,
floor
debate,
the
exact
same
kind
of
documents
that
this
court
considered
in
hodory
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
my
understanding
of
what
the
petitioner
is
urging
here
is
that
the
payment
of
unemployment
benefits
during
strikes,
which
includes
all
the
different
options
that
all
the
different
states
have
adopted
can't
be
done.
and
that
therefore,
the
uniform
policy
that
they're
presupposing
is
you
don't
pay
any
unemployment
benefits
during
strikes
under
any
possible
option
or
approach.
now,
that
is
a
uniform
policy
and
in
fact,
the
words
that
used
a
number
of
different
times,
in
the
petition
and
in
petition's
brief
that
the
federal
government
requires
a
uniform
national
policy
in
the
question
and
that
policy
is
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
though
in
this
precise
area.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
in
the
question
of
paying
unemployment
benefits
to
strikers,
no
matter
what
the
option
is,
no
matter
what
the
version,
no
matter
what
the
money,
no
matter
what
the
circumstances,
no
pay
under
any
circumstances.
and
they
have
repeatedly
used
the
phrase.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
they
have
repeatedly
used
the
phrase
that
a
uniform
national
policy
is
essential,
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
to
the
extent
that
you
can't
pay
unemployment
benefits
during
strikes.
and
that's
what
the
vast
majority
of
states
differ.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
i
think
that's
an
inconsistency
in
their
position,
but
i
think
it's
there
that
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes
indeed
we
do
your
honor.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
i
think
what
the
second
circuit
was
doing.
they
didn't
really
discuss
or
consider
the
facts
at
all.
they
simply
said
that
even
viewing
petitioner's
case
in
its
best
light
and
even
assuming
there
were
such
a
conflict,
it
wouldn't
matter,
because
congress
has
said
that
the
states
may
legislate.
and
i
think
that's
absolutely
true.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
i
think
by
large,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
were
--
in
other
words,
we
don't
feel,
we
feel
that
the
record
overwhelmingly
refutes
the
impact,
because
of
the
statistics
that
we
evolved.
but
that
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
issue
here,
because
the
question
is
what
did
congress
intend?
and
that
intention
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
not
only
the
social
security
act,
but
all
the
other
statutes
in
which
congress
has
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
this
question.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
think
they
weren't
--
they
were
not
interested
in
the
facts
and
properly
so,
because
the
question
of
pre-emption
is
not
one
of
the
economic
theory,
it's
one
of
congressional
intention.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
but
here,
the
question
is
did
congress
permit,
did
congress
intend
that
the
states
have
the
latitude
that
we
say
that
the
social
security
act
and
these
other
statutes
demonstrated.
and
if
that
is
so,
then
the
state
has
a
right
to
choose
whatever
option
it
wishes.
now,
the
new
york
statute
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
that
hasn't
to
do
with
unemployment
compensation,
so
i
couldn't
say
what
restrictions
there
might
be
on
that.
the
issue
here
really
is
what
--
did
the
social
security
act
allow
the
state
to
do
as
far
as
the
payment
of
unemployment
compensation
is
concerned.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
that
the
employer
should
contribute
to
the
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
the
method
of
financing,
the
unemployment
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
the
method
of
--
as
far
as
the
method
of
financing
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
perhaps
we
don't,
but
i
believe
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
was
i
believe
an
answer
to
a
question
about
what
the
social
security
act
did
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
its
structure
was
to
give
this
broad
permission,
but
what's
i
think
equally
significant
here
is
that
new
yorks
law
existed
at
the
time
that
the
social
security
act,
the
national
labor
relations
act
were
passed.
and
so
it's
clear
that
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
i
really
wouldn't,
because
i
think
the
--
as
i
said
the
social
security
act
did
give
a
plenary
and
general
permission.
however,
that
would
be
unfeasible
and
politically
--
it's
a
thing
that
couldn't
happen,
but
it's
a
thing
that
congress
would
have
to
move
in
then
to
prevent
as
it
can
and
frequently
does.
but
as
i
said
before,
the
confidence
that
congress
visited
in
us
has
not
been
abused
by
that
sort
of
provision.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
say
that
at
stake
in
this
case
is
the
state's
right
to
determine
what's
in
the
best
interest
of
new
york
citizens.
and
congress
has
given
new
york
that
right,
given
that
right,
knowing
exactly
what
new
york's
law
said
at
the
time
that
it
passed
both
the
statutes
that
were
speaking
of.
and
it's
rare
that
you
have
so
many
different
indications
of
congressional
intent,
all
pointing
in
the
same
direction.
and
petitioner's
proffering
response
only
a
general
pre-emption
principle
derived
from
the
overall
plan
of
the
nlra,
which
has
never
been
held
to
be
absolute.
and
for
this
reason,
we
urge
the
affirmance
of
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
second
circuit.
