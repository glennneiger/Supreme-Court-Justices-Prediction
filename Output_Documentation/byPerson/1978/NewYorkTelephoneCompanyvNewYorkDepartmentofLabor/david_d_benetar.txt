mr.
david
d.
benetar
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
up
for
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
reversing
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district,
judgment,
after
a
trial,
nine-day
trial,
holding
that
the
york
state
statute
granting
unemployment
compensation
to
strikers
was
unconstitutional,
the
reversal
reinstated
the
statute.
under
the
statute,
payments
are
made
to
strikers
after
seven
weeks
waiting
period
plus
the
one
week
required
of
all
claimants
for
compensation.
the
cost
of
unemployment
insurance
or
compensation
is
borne
by
the
employer
against
whom
the
strikers
called.
after
this
trial,
the
district
court,
and
i'll
briefly,
very
briefly
sketch
the
outstanding
holdings
or
findings
of
the
district
court.
the
statute,
he
held,
was
in
direct
and
substantial
conflict
with
the
national
policy
of
neutrality
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
so
far
as
economic
contest
are
concerned
in
the
field
of
collective
bargaining.
he
held
that
the
state
intervention,
on
behalf
of
strikers
causing
employers
to
finance
strikes
against
themselves.
therefore,
he
held
that
the
law
was
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended,
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
substantial
impact
of
new
york's
law
on
bargaining
and
strikes
was
evidenced
if
indeed
it
is
itself
evident.
by
documentary
proof
emanating
in
considerable
measure
from
involved
unions,
those
involved
in
the
strike
and
major
unions
generally
in
the
country.
from
economic
data,
from
expert
opinion,
and
from
employers'
views,
and
perhaps
most
concretely
it
was
evident
or
evidenced,
from
the
fact
that
$49
million
in
unemployment
compensation
was
paid
out
in
the
course
of
the
particular
strike
which
led
up
to
this
lawsuit.
now,
the
second
circuit
accepted
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
they
acknowledged
the
conflict,
which
the
district
court
found
between
the
national
policy
of
neutrality,
and
the
state
statute
in
question.
nevertheless,
although
they
said
in
their
words
that
a
positive
expression
of
congressional
intent
is
lacking,
nevertheless
they
said
we
will
reverse
because
by
resorting
to
inference,
we
find
that
congress
intended
to
tolerate
this
conflict.
and
that
they
saw
this
wholly
area
of
payment
to
strikers
as
one
inviting
to
state
experimentation,
on
a
state
by
state
basis.
uncertain
and
unambiguous
legislative
history,
which
we
contend
is
all
there
is
in
this
case,
falls
far
short
of
the
standard
of
clarity
that's
required
to
justify
an
invasion
of
the
neutrality
principle.
the
direct
opposite
of
what
the
second
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
sorry.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
i
think
that
on
principle,
the
position
would
have
to
be
the
same.
but
in
the
case
of
a
lock
out,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
aware
of
the
same
kind
of
statistics
concerning
impact,
concerning
frequency
for
example,
strikes
and
lock
outs
are
just
not
comparable
in
numbers.
so,
i
would
want
to
look
into
that
question,
because
we
in
this
case
develop
impact
very
thoroughly.
but
on
principle,
as
i
said
at
the
opening
of
my
answer,
i
think
they
would
both
have
to
be
controlled
by
the
same
considerations.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
no,
i
would
not
sir,
i
would
not.
i
see
welfare
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
in
a
few
ways,
and
what
happened
in
this
case
sort
of
dramatizes
the
difference,
because
with
33,000
workers
who
collected
unemployment
compensation
and
1,000
who
applied
for
welfare.
now,
the
difference
that
i
see,
the
differences
are
manifold.
number
one,
unemployment
insurance
is
fixed,
certain,
and
promised.
you
know
that
it's
coming
after
a
certain
number
of
weeks.
you
know
the
amount.
number
two,
there
is
no
needs
test,
because
unemployment
compensation
wasn't
intended
in
this
origins.
people
--
the
congress
wasn't
thinking
in
these
origins
about
needs,
except
those
created
by
the
great
depression,
when
people
were
looking
for
work
and
couldn't
find
it.
so,
there
was
no
--
there's
no
needs
test
and
finally,
if
the
court
pleases,
welfare
is
not
subsidized,
paid
for
by
the
very
employer
against
whom
the
strike
is
being
called
and
maintained.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
it
may
--
well,
in
our
case,
as
your
honor
can
see
from
the
figures,
the
impacts
of
welfare
and
unemployment
insurance
were
nowhere
nearly
equal.
the
unemployment
compensation
far
outweighed
the
impact
of
welfare.
and
i
think
that
there's
another
aspect
to
this
and
that
is
that
in
the
case
of
welfare,
one
would
have
to
consider
perhaps
and
weigh
the
interest
of
this
state.
if
it
was
out
in
out
trying
to
protect
welfare,
not
other
the
guise
of
unemployment
insurance,
but
i
do
not
see
and
i've
never
seen
any
proof
to
indicate
impact
to
the
extent
that
i
have
described
to
the
court
in
these
few
opening
sentences.
if
there
were
such
proof,
perhaps
the
situation
might
be
changed.
but
as
far
as
i
know
and
as
far
as
i
read
the
situation,
they
do
stand
on
a
different
fitting
--
footing
welfare
and
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
if
it
was
what?
mr.
david
d.
benetar
it
would
be
different
but
not
in
any
way
basically
ordered.
it
would
be
different
because
the
direct
subsidy
by
the
employer
involved,
of
course,
underscores
and
emphasizes
the
extent
of
the
invasion
of
the
principle
of
neutrality.
you're
not
only
helping
the
striker,
but
you're
putting
the
burden
on
it
--
of
it
on
the
man
against
whom
the
strike
is
being
called.
so
in
my
judgment,
if
the
only
thing
that
was
present
were
the
payout
of
$49
million,
i
would
still
say
that
under
unemployment
compensation
statute,
this
was
an
unlawful
and
preempted
statute
and
that
the
payment
should
not
be
made.
now,
the
--
in
a
way
i've
said
in
my
answers,
what
i'm
about
to
say
now,
but
i
think
it's
important,
this
case
touches
on
the
core
of
our
national
policy,
this
is
no
glancing
blow.
it
goes
to
the
core
of
our
national
policy
of
neutrality,
a
policy
leaving
the
resolution
of
economic
disputes
to
the
free
play
of
economic
forces.
congress
enacted
this
comprehensive
policy
because
at
this
--
as
this
court
has
said,
because
of
the
perceived
inadequacy
of
the
states
to
create
a
comprehensive
and
equitable
way
of
dealing
with
the
adjustments
between
parties
to
labor
disputes,
that
was
the
genesis
of
this,
to
get
a
federal
law
that
would
wipe
out
the
state
differences
and
they
were
wide
and
varied.
and
make
this
principle
of
neutrality,
a
principle
across
the
land.
now,
as
we
see
the
precise
question
here
then,
it
is
this,
can
congress
reasonably
be
said
to
have
intended
by
the
social
security
act,
to
invite
the
states
to
re-enter
through
the
vehicle
of
unemployment
compensation,
the
field
that
congress
had
just
preempted
five
or
six
weeks
before
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that's
the
time
relationship
between
the
two
acts.
and
invite,
did
they
intended
then
within
five
or
six
weeks
invite
the
states
to
re-enter
this
preempted
territory
and
substitute
their
several
concepts
of
neutrality
and
of
the
balance
of
economic
forces
or
power
in
place
of
the
balance
struck
by
congress?
that's
what
we
see
as
the
question
in
the
case,
and
we
think
too
a
very
considerable
extent
it
answers
itself.
now
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
david
d.
benetar
between
1935
and
now?
mr.
david
d.
benetar
yes,
in
the
new
york
law,
do
you
mean?
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
there
are
changes
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
not
entirely,
because
in
'35,
we
were
in
the
--
as
your
honor
remembers,
we
were
in
a
deep
depression.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
the
president
has
characterized
it
otherwise,
and
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
all
of
us
feel
that
regardless
of
the
untoward
events
that
had
been
happening
to
us,
this
is
not
a
deep
depression.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
no,
well
and
the
threat
is
inimminent,
for
any
of
us,
we
don't
feel
it
the
same
way.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
the
point
that
i'm
making?
mr.
david
d.
benetar
no
sir,
with
all
deference,
i
would
answer
you
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
no
sir.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
no
sir,
no.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
in
1935,
there
was
no
experience
rating
under
the
new
york
law.
in
fact,
if
your
honor
pleases,
payouts
under
the
new
york
law
weren't
made
for
a
year
or
two
after
1935,
so
nobody
knew
what
the
extent
of
the
payments
were
then.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
or
'37.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
i'm
not
sure
of
the
date.
but
the
question
of
imposing
the
cost
on
the
employer
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
--
through
experience
rating
was
at
least
ten
years
later
and
maybe
more.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
it
has
been
that
way
ever
since.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
congress
has
known
it
as
a
concept
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
i
haven't
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
i'm
not
aware
that
they
have
done
so,
because
we
are
of
the
belief
that
this
doesn't
require
any
further
congressional
action.
we
don't
think
that
congress
ever
conceived
of
the
kind
of
situation
that
we're
presenting
to
this
court
today,
in
terms
of
payout,
in
terms
of
double
violation
of
the
neutrality
concept,
i
don't
think
congress
has
the
remotest
notion
of
it
in
1935.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
what
should
it
do?
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
i
think
that
the
congress
would
have
the
right
to
change
the
concept
of
neutrality,
but
i
don't
think
that
they
would,
could
or
would
do
that
without
measuring
the
effect
of
so
drastic
and
invasion
of
the
forbidden
area
under
one
hand
with
the
desire
if
there
was
one
on
new
york's
part
to
keep
using
unemployment
compensation
as
a
vehicle
for
paying
out
money,
not
on
a
basis
of
needs.
i
just
don't
think
that
it
would
happen
that
way.
now,
a
few
words
about
the
strike
that
led
to
this,
before
it
was
over
or
i
should
say
this,
that
on
july
14th
of
1971,
a
cwa
communication
workers
called
a
nationwide
strike
against
the
bell
system
companies
who
are
bargaining
with
that
at
that
time,
including
these
petitioners.
four
days
later,
an
agreement
was
reached,
the
union
recommended
it
to
the
members,
urged
ratification,
and
was
ratified
on
the
national
basis,
except
in
new
york,
where
it
was
turned
down.
and
new
york
went
on
strike
and
ultimately,
the
national
union
sort
of
joined
the
strike
in
the
sense
that
the
new
york
authorities
insisted
on
conducting
it,
so
the
national
union
went
along
with
it.
before
the
strike
was
over
in
new
york,
seven
months
had
elapsed,
$49
million
as
i've
said
were
paid
out
to
some
33,000
strikers,
and
the
unemployment
insurance
account
of
telephone
company
alone
was
depleted
by
$40
million,
which
was
required
to
replace
and
it's
in
the
process
of
replacing.
the
employers
were
influenced
to
settle
against
their
better
judgment,
this
was
all
in
the
findings
which
were
accepted
on
terms
in
new
york,
which
broke
the
national
pattern.
they
didn't
want
to
do
that
but
they
felt
that
the
strikers
had
several
more
weeks
if
not
months
of
unemployment
compensation
coming
and
that
there
just
wasn't
any
use
in
carrying
the
fight
any
longer.
contrasted
with
the
$49
million
paid
out
by
the
companies
through
vehicle
of
unemployment
compensation
was
$14
million
paid
out
of
the
union's
strike
fund.
small
wonder
under
those
circumstances
that
we
find
the
union
leader
who
conducted
this
strike
in
new
york,
bulletenizing
his
members
immediately
after
the
strike
was
over
and
saying
to
them,
the
fact
that
we
kept
out
33
or
whatever
thousand
people
it
was
on
strike
for
280%
of
the
membership
for
218
days
he
says,
that
factor
is
an
incredible
phenomenon
and
it's
due
to
three
outstanding
causes:
1)
dedication
and
spirit
of
the
strikers;
2)
unemployment
insurance;
3)
the
effectiveness
of
the
cwa's
strike
fund.
and
the
strike
fund
rightfully
took
third
place
in
view
of
what
i've
said
to
you
about
the
comparative
figures
between
them.
the
union
involved
in
the
strike
publicly
referred
to
the
strike
as
our
strike
weapon.
they
saw
it
very
realistically
that
what
this
was,
was
a
strike
weapon,
an
economic
weapon
and
that's
what
accounted
for
what
they
call
the
phenomenon
of
the
218-day
hold
out.
now,
it
should
not
be
the
--
suppose
for
a
moment
that
this
was
an
isolated
instance,
according
to
the
new
york
labor
department
of
statistics,
almost
10%
of
the
strikes
over
a
period
of
some
15
or
20
years,
published
statistics,
almost
10%
lasted
eight
weeks
or
more.
13.8%
of
all
employees
involved
in
strikes
were
involved
in
such
lengthy
strikes,
and
51%
of
all
man
days
made
idle
by
these
lengthy
strikes
or
rather
51%
all
man
days
made
idle
in
all
strike
were
attributable
to
this
lengthy,
more
than
eight
weeks
strikes.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
up
to
50%.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
up
to
50%
tax
free.
and
the
testimony
at
the
trial
was
that
what
they
get
from
unemployment
compensation
is
enough
to
take
care
of
the
necessities
of
life.
it's
more
than
they
get
from
most
unions
in
strike
benefits,
considerably
more.
in
fact,
this
union
stopped
giving
out
benefits
for
food,
as
soon
as
unemployment
compensation
took
over.
they
were
relieved
of
that
burden,
which
was
rightfully
theirs
if
the
neutrality
principle
is
to
control.
in
the
brief
of
the
rochester
telephone
company
and
others
as
amicus
here,
are
listed
in
addition
to
the
statistics
i've
given
you,
pending
actions,
where
other
employers
in
new
york
state
have
been
injured
by
the
situation
i've
just
been
describing.
now,
the
guiding
principles
against
which
the
miscellaneous
items
of
legislative
history
and
i
characterized
them
that
way,
because
i
think
that's
what
they
are,
strung
together
miscellaneous
items,
some
pointing
in
one
direction,
some
pointing
in
another,
but
none
of
them
speaking
out
and
saying,
"it
is
congress'
intent
to
allow
this
as
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
neutrality."
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
i
think
that
the
rule
of
neutrality,
of
course,
was
discerned
and
laid
down
by
this
court,
and
i
presume
that
this
court
discernment
went
to
the
question
of
what
congress
intended
in
the
first
place
by
it?
and
as
i
look
at
the
picture
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
but
the
legislative
history
summarized
in
lockridge,
says
that
congress
acted
because
of
the
perceived
inability
of
the
states
to
handle
these
problems
in
a
uniform
coherent
manner
and
to
balance
the
respective
equities
or
strengths
of
the
parties.
congress
was
dissatisfied
with
the
way
once
they
would
go
one
way,
helping
unions
in
another
state,
would
go
another
way,
helping
employers.
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
structure
of
that
act
and
you
see
how
government
access
a
policeman,
but
in
no
place
does
it
come
in
to
the
actual
bargaining,
i
believe
the
doctrine
of
neutrality
was
implicit
in
there
from
the
date
the
statute
was
signed
in
the
law
by
the
president.
and
i
believe
that
when
this
court
announced
what
that
case
meant,
i
think
they
were
reading
congress'
mind
in
the
clearest
possible
way.
now,
these
principles
which
have
been
discerned
in
this
area,
that
states
may
not
legislate
with
the
tendency
to
frustrate
the
operation
of
federal
law
scheme
or
which
creates
substantial
risk
of
conflict
with
policies
central
to
the
federal
labor
law.
free
collective
bargaining,
dictating
government
neutrality
and
banning
strikes,
out
of
state
entry
into
areas
left
to
the
free
play
of
economic
forces.
and
by
the
way,
my
remarks
are
sprinkled
with
quotations
from
this
court.
it's
hard
to
talk
about
this
subject
without
picking
up
the
phrases
that
have
gone
through
the
decisions
here
as
the
court,
through
what
it
calls
the
process
of
elucidating
litigation
has
clarified
the
intent
of
congress
by
the
kind
of
phrases
that
i've
been
using,
they
are
not
mine,
most
of
them
are
borrowed
from
supreme
court
decisions.
free,
oh
i've
covered
that
and
lodge
'76
tells
us
that
this
neutrality
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
federal
policy.
now,
the
use
of
economic
forces
by
either
party
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
process
and
not
a
grudging
exception.
if
the
parties
look
for
economic
combat,
they
must
look
to
themselves
to
carry
it
on.
and
this
is
the
catalyst
which
congress
in
this
court
looks
for
to
bring
about
settlements.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
if
they
did
i
don't
recall
they're
citing
lodge
'76.
yes
they
did,
yes
they
did
but
one
can
cite
a
case,
but
when
you
read
lodge
'76,
there
is
no
way
in
my
opinion
of
its
supporting
with
the
second
circuit
did,
because
the
case
reaffirms
in
the
clearest
terms
that
what
i've
said
is
true
and
that
the
catalyst
relied
on
by
congress
and
by
this
court
as
seen
from
the
words
of
the
act,
the
catalyst
relied
on
is
the
unaided
struggle
between
the
parties
leading
one
of
them
just
say,
"we've
had
enough",
and
the
government
is
not
suppose
to
enter
into
that
area.
in
a
presumption
case
such
--
pre-emption
case
such
as
this,
such
as
lodge
'76,
the
crucial
inquiry
is
whether
congress
intended
this
field
to
be
unregulated
because
it
was
left
to
be
uncontrolled
--
to
be
controlled
by
the
free
play
of
economic
forces.
and
that's
where
lodge
'76
was
cited
mr.
justice
marshall,
that's
where
it
was
cited
by
the
second
circuit.
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
i
simply
want
to
do
confirm
--
mr.
david
d.
benetar
well,
my
view
of
it
is
that
the
area
below
was
compounded
by
their
recognition
of
the
principle
without
giving
an
effect,
that's
my
view
of
it.
i
think
what
they
did
was
to
take
a
principle
of
great
weight
and
then
from
these
fragments
of
so-called
legislative
history,
they
drew
an
inference
admitting
that
congress
had
not
spoken
clearly
on
this.
they
drew
an
inference
that
congress
intended
to
violate
the
very
policy
which
they
were
quoting
from.
and
i
don't
think
that
when
you
take
inference
from
ambiguous,
uncertain
legislative
history
which
points
in
two
directions
and
you
pitted
against
the
centerpiece
of
the
national
scheme
that
you
can
come
out
with
a
result,
which
justifies
the
piercing
with
a
violation
or
the
invasion
of
the
national
scheme.
now,
the
proven
effect
of
the
new
york
statute,
no
doubt
about
it,
acknowledged
by
the
second
circuit,
that
they
acknowledged
too
that
there
is
this
conflict,
is
the
proven
effect
is
to
order
the
balance
of
power
between
the
parties.
now,
let's
just
briefly
take
a
look
at
that
history
in
an
overall
sense,
because
we
brief
the
details
of
it.
the
court
of
appeals
as
i've
said
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
positive
expression
of
congressional
intent.
the
first
circuit
in
grinnell
went
through
that
whole
list
of
items
of
congressional
history,
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
clear
to
establish
congressional
intent,
either
way
and
prior
to
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
this
case,
every
other
federal
court
that
considered
the
matter
reach
the
same
conclusion.
and
an
inconclusive
legislative
record,
we
submit
is
not
an
adequate
basis
for
permitting
new
york's
interference
with
federal
policy
as
found
by
the
courts
below
and
wherein
a
particularly
tender
area,
as
professor
cox
has
said,
where
a
state
law
is
based
on
an
accommodation
of
the
special
interest
of
employer's
unions
and
employees
in
collective
bargaining,
the
balance
struck
by
congress
among
those
same
interest
requires
exclusion,
unless
congress
has
provided
otherwise.
well,
congress
has
not
provided
otherwise,
and
there
is
no
reliable
indication
that
it
even
intended
to
provide
otherwise.
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
the
malone
case
stresses
the
question
of
clarity,
how
much
clarity
is
really
needed
before
one
can
say
that
a
key
tenet
is
a
federal
policy
has
been
violated.
