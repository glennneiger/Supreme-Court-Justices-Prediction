justice
potter
stewart
well,
pre-emption
generally
is
a
constitutional
principle
stemming
from
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
federal
law
prevails.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
because
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
specifically
the
supremacy
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
say
as
though
that
statement
followed
from
what
you
told
us,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
does.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
were
those
restrictions?
justice
potter
stewart
that
if
he
failed
to
seek
new
work
he
could
be
denied,
that's
what
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
to
seek
new
comfortable
work.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
to
prevent
any
state
plans
from
allowing
--
justice
potter
stewart
--on
employment
compensation
to
strikers.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
states
do
pay
benefits?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
it
was
your
brief
but
i
haven't
read
that
for
a
long
time.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
pay
just
indiscriminately
to
any
economic
strike?
justice
potter
stewart
a
waiting
period,
a
waiting
period,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
my
question
was
how
many
do
not
fix
on
particular
circumstances?
justice
potter
stewart
like
new
york,
which
perhaps
with
a
waiting
period,
but
otherwise
this
condition.
justice
potter
stewart
rhode
island?
justice
potter
stewart
and
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
hawaii
had
that
--
if
the
employer
stays
in
business
with
80%
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
but
only
new
york
and
rhode
island,
and
possibly
the
virgin
islands.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
pay
out
in
any
economic
strike,
at
least
after
a
waiting
period?
justice
potter
stewart
during
the
waiting
period.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
meets
certain
conditions?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
your
brief
retreats
from
the
rational
conclusion
of
that
position,
i.e.
if
a
state
decided
to
pay
double
wages
to
strikers,
you'd
have
a
hard
time.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
think
there
would
be
no
pre-emption
of
that,
if
the
state
decided
about
economic
strikers,
we're
going
to
pay
double
what
they
get
by
working?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
there
would
be
no
pre-emption
problem
with
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
it's
given
in
your
brief,
it's
given
in
your
brief
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
some
amicus
brief
or
something.
justice
potter
stewart
but
sometimes
that
quite
a
violent
assumption.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
precise
area?
justice
potter
stewart
your
opponent
doesn't
question
at
all
the
autonomy
of
the
states
to
indulge
in
all
the
variety
they
want
to
in
other
areas
of
unemployment
compensation.
justice
potter
stewart
despite
the
two-court
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
future
findings
by
the
district
court
which
were
not
upset
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
your
familiar
course
with
the
two-court
rule,
aren't
you?
