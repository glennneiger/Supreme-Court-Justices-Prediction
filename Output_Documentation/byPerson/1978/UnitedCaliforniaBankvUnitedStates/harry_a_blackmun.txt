justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
gother
in
your
primary
brief
you
didn’t
say
it
foster
lumber?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
cited
it
in
or
rather
collaterally
in
your
reply
brief.
do
you
feel
that
foster
lumber
has
no
significance
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that’s
conceded
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
isn’t
the
--
we
know
a
lot,
isn’t
the
general
principle
the
same
however,
here
is
the
fairly
--
here’s
a
statute
that
seems
to
say
one
thing
and
they
conceded
intent
of
congress
the
other
way.
and
i
just
wondered
whether
your
failure
to
cite
is
indicative
of
the
fact
that
maybe
it’s
against
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
we
get
down
to
then
and
your
approach
is,
it
is
whether
the
estate
is
a
conduit,
nothing
more?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
to
the
government
not
only
does
not
object
but
it
actually
concedes
that
with
respect
to
a
taxable
distributee,
this
is
the
correct
method
under
the
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
will
in
the
record
incidentally
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
ferguson
in
the
government’s
view,
who
held
title
to
this
share
of
the
residue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
do
concede
that
legal
result?
