mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
afraid
our
differences
are
more
basic
than
i
had
originally
anticipated
from
reading
the
briefs.
the
government
simply
does
not
accept
the
basic
premise
that
there
are
three
pots
or
three
conduits
or
three
shells,
whatever
they
are.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
sir
i
would
have
to
say
that
first
of
all,
the
estate
is
nonetheless
a
tax
payer,
a
private
tax
payer
under
the
provisions
of
the
code
as
it
would
be
in
any
other
case.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
i
think
that
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
i
think
it
is
that
simple.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
the
provisions
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
distribution
to
a
charity
qualify
as
a
charitable
deduction
for
the
state.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
if
it
does
then
the
charitable
deduction
would
eliminate
any
taxable
income
assuming
--
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
i
agree.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
i
agree
that
as
long
as
it’s
a
charitable
deduction
which
qualifies
and
the
amount
of
that
deduction
equals
the
gross
income
there
would
be
no
net
tax
due
from
the
estate.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
exactly.
there
are
certain
limitations
on
the
charitable
deduction
which
applied
to
an
estate
which
would
not
have
applied
to
the
decedent
and
there
are
likewise
certain
benefits
or
allowances
which
would
not
have
been
permitted
to
the
decedent
during
his
life.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
no
your
honor
i
don’t,
i
think
that
the
ultimate
intent
of
congress
was
to
treat
the
estate
as
a
tax
payer
separate
and
apart
from
the
decedent
on
the
one
hand
and
separate
and
apart
from
the
distributees
and
beneficiaries
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
your
honor
your
example
posited
a
particular
kind
of
estate,
one
in
which
the
entire
residue
was
to
go
to
charity.
in
that
case
i
would
assume
that
the
provisions
of
the
estate
would
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
conditions
of
the
charitable
deduction
and
leave
no
net
taxable
income.
for
that
reason
i
answered
your
first
question
that
there
would
be
no
net
taxable
income.
in
response
to
your
last
question
which
was
whether
there
is
a
general
intent
of
congress
to
exempt
all
income
going
ultimately
to
charities,
as
my
learned
friend
suggested,
i
must
disagree
with
that.
i
think
that
the
clear
intent
of
congress
was
to
strain
all
items
of
gross
income
coming
in
to
the
custody
and
management
of
the
estate
through
the
estate’s
gross
income
and
through
the
deductions
which
are
allowable.
so
as
to
make
sure
that
any
amounts
which
are
paid
out
or
set
aside
to
charity,
meet
the
conditions
of
the
charitable
deduction
and
if
they
do
not
then
the
estate
has
a
tax,
a
tax
which
it
pays
and
which
obviously,
ultimately
becomes
a
burden
on
that
part
of
the
residual
estate
indicated
by
the
will
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
tax.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
we
do
not
dispute
that
under
the
provisions
of
california
law,
title
to
all
parts
of
the
residue
personality
and
realty
was
vested
as
of
the
moment
of
death
in
the
ultimate
takers,
charitable
and
non-charitable.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
oh!
indeed
we
think
however,
that
is
irrelevant.
in
fact,
i
had
not
thought
that
there
was
a
significance
to
that.
the
tax
payer
did
not
contest
on
brief
that
the
estate
was
a
tax
payer
with
respect
to
the
property
which
it
was
administering.
even
this
ingenuous
argument
which
is
suggested
because
of
some
dicta
in
bowers
versus
slocum
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
gross
income
arising
from
the
sales
which
the
estate
made
was
not
gross
income
of
the
estate.
indeed
it
is
gross
income
of
the
estate,
all
of
it.
there
is
a
case
not
cited
in
the
party's
briefs
in
which
the
tax
court
considered
the
effect
of
california
law
and
that
case
is
estate
of
kahn,
8
tax
court
784.
the
tax
court
followed
the
general
rule
which
had
been
followed
in
many
other
earlier
cases
that
title
to
property
does
not
define
the
gross
taxable
assets
in
the
estate.
the
estate
for
sub-chapter
(j)
purposes,
sub-chapter
(j)
being
those
sections
dealing
with
the
income
taxation
of
estates
is
defined
in
section
641
to
include
all
income
arising
from
assets
within
the
custody,
management
and
control
of
the
executor.
these
assets,
the
shares
of
stock
in
walt
disney
productions
were
clearly
assets
of
the
estate
and
when
those
assets
where
sold,
they
generated
gross
income
for
the
estate.
the
estate
indeed
is
bowers
versus
slocum
pointed
out
at
page
351
of
that
second
circuit’s
opinion
and
i
quote
from
page
351
“cannot
escape
from
taxation
except
by
taking
the
deductions
provided
therefore
in
the
statutory
scheme.
so,
i
think
that
the
question
properly
framed
is
whether
the
payments
here
in
question
constitute
a
deduction
which
is
allowable
under
1201
(b)
in
the
calculation
of
the
alternative
tax.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
yes
sir
that
is
correct.
sub-chapter
(j)
i
think
makes
it
clear
that
in
estate
like
a
trust
is
a
taxable
entity
which
is
taxable
as
if
it
were
an
individual
according
to
section
641
with
the
various
modifications
in
that
general
scheme
is
set
forth.
one
of
the
modifications
which
is
critical
here
is
the
different
kind
of
charitable
deduction
permitted.
an
individual
for
example
can
take
a
charitable
deduction
by
giving
property
to
a
charity,
an
estate
may
not.
an
estate
may
only
claim
a
charitable
deduction
if
it
can
establish
that
the
amount
paid
to
charity
was
out
of
its
gross
income.
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
the
capital
gains
which
were
set
aside
for
the
charity
were
out
of
the
estate's
gross
income.
i
have
not
thought
there
was
such
a
dispute
anyway.
the
45%
of
the
residue
of
the
estate
which
was
earmarked
for
qualified
charities
meant
that
45
%
of
the
capital
gains
generated
by
the
estate,
its
capital
gains
qualified
for
the
charitable
deduction
set
aside
in
arriving
at
the
estates
taxable
income.
and
i
think
that’s
where
we
must
begin
as
judge
sneed
in
the
ninth
circuit
by
pointing
out
that
in
the
normal
computation
of
an
estate's
taxable
income,
it’s
capital
gains
are
first
computed,
including
all
of
the
sale
of
these
shares
of
stock,
the
1202
deduction,
the
deduction
of
50%
of
the
capital
gains
is
then
computed
on
the
full
amount
of
those
gains
which
would
include
the
45%
as
tax
payer's
first
position
had
indicated
and
then
the
balance
left
in
taxable
income
after
an
appropriate
adjustment
for
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
1202
deduction
already
for
part
of
those
capital
gains,
is
then
permitted
as
a
deduction
under
section
642
(c)
as
long
as
it
meets
the
conditions
of
that
section,
that
is
they
must
be
permanently
set
aside
for
charity.
the
set
aside
deduction
is
really
a
rather
special
deduction
because
it
involves
allowing
an
estate
to
take
a
deduction
for
an
amount
not
actually
paid
out.
there
is
obviously
a
room
for
abuse
for
sheltering
income
which
will
be
going
to
the
private
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
and
for
that
reason
they’ve
set
aside
deduction
like
the
rest
of
the
charitable
deduction
in
642
(c)
as
restricted
to
gross
income
items.
now,
if
i
may
proceed
from
that
basic
point
which
i
think
is
the
statutory
scheme
that
the
estate
must
report
and
take
into
account
all
of
the
gross
income
which
it
generates
by
sale
of
estate
assets?
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
i
had
not
thought
so.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
we
come
now
to
the
question
of
whether
the
estate
in
computing
its
--
its
tax
on
its
net
taxable
income
can
achieve
a
lower
rate
by
using
the
so-called
alternative
tax
under
1201
(b)
by
combining
this
deduction
for
charitable
contributions
with
the
1201
(b)
alternative
lower
tax
rate
by
off
setting
it
against
capital
gains.
i
think
that
the
reasoning
of
the
weil
case,
the
reasoning
of
judge
sneed
below,
and
the
reasoning
of
the
tax
court
in
the
statler
trust
case
which
was
reversed
by
the
second
circuit,
all
are
perfectly
consonant
with
the
assumption
which
this
court
made
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
foster
lumber
that
the
alternative
capital
gains
tax
is
a
tax
upon
all
of
the
capital
gains
of
the
taxpayer,
unreduced
by
deductions
which
as
my
learned
friend
has
described
them
are
taken
into
account
in
arriving
a
taxable
income,
so-called
ordinary
deductions,
ordinary
income
deductions.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
that’s
quite
true
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
the
tax
court
decision
in
statler
trust
which
the
second
circuit
by
a
divided
vote
reversed.
so
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
if
i
can
refer
to
it
this
way,
the
line
up
of
authorities
directly
on
point
would
be
the
statler
trust
tax
court
decision,
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion
below
in
this
case
and
the
sixth
circuit’s
decision
on
the
weil
case
and
of
course
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
dooling
in
the
second
circuit
against
the
majority
opinion
in
statler
trust.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
the
weil
case
was
a
charitable
deduction
case
involving
an
individual.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
that
your
honor
is
a
place
where
we
do
depart
from
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
however,
i
would
suggest
that
the
statutory
scheme
which
we
must
look
at
is
1201
and
1202
together.
1202
which
is
the
normal
method
of
tax,
if
the
alternative
computation
is
not
used,
specifically
provides
that
capital
gains
which
are
distributable
to
beneficiaries
under
662
and
661
which
do
not
include
charities.
these
are
the
so-called
private
or
taxable
beneficiaries,
are
not
taken
into
account
in
making
the
capital
gains
computation
of
the
estate
or
trust.
that
is
because
the
statutory
scheme
of
sub-chapter
(j),
as
we
have
heard
from
the
taxpayer,
treats
the
taxable
entity
of
the
estate
or
of
the
trust
as
essentially
sharing
in
the
income
with
its
taxable
beneficiaries
to
the
extent
the
income
is
currently
distributed.
now,
to
the
extent
the
income
is
currently
distributed,
the
conduit
rule
which
has
been
taken
out
of
context
and
used
for
the
charitable
deduction,
but
the
conduit
rule
as
congress
explained
it
in
the
committee
reports
is
appropriate
to
treat
the
estate
income
currently
paid
out
as
carrying
with
it
a
share
of
all
of
the
various
categories
of
income,
including
capital
gain.
since
the
individual
beneficiaries
will
receiving
it,
a
part
of
the
capital
gain
currently
of
the
estate,
will
each
make
their
own
election,
whether
they
use
1202
or
1201
(b),
i
really
shouldn’t
call
any
election,
that’s
an
alternative
tax
computation
requirement.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
right,
that’s
a
requirement,
but
since
each
will
make
their
own
individual
computation,
the
applicability
of
1202
or
1201
(b)
to
each
beneficiary
will
be
separately
determined.
it
would
have
been
clearer
if
a
similar
sentence
had
also
appeared
in
1201
(b)
with
respect
to
taxable
beneficiaries.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
your
honor,
there
are
two
cases
below
which
involved
just
--
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
no.
the
answer
is
no
because
a
charity
and
the
two
cases
which
have
reached
this
question
in
the
court
of
claims
in
the
mott
case
and
the
tax
court
very
recently
in
the
o’conner
case,
have
both
held
that
the
charity
cannot
be
a
distributee
of
dni
under
any
circumstances.
it
is
not
a
beneficiary
within
the
661,
662
scheme.
in
fact
section
663
as
judge
sneed
to
point
it
out
specifically
holds
out
charities
from
the
scheme.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
that’s
right
your
honor
because
--
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
right
and
distributees
are.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
so
that
a
charity
--
that
the
allowance
for
a
charity
is
the
charitable
deduction
which
is
a
true
deduction
from
taxable
income.
now
the
691
(c)
cases
which
deal
with
a
--
with
what
is
clearly
a
deduction
i
think
under
691
(c)
are
by
their
terms
not
deductions
in
arriving
a
taxable
income.
it’s
a
special
deduction,
as
indeed
the
micener
case
made
this
point
and
it
distinguished
the
tax
court’s
decision
in
stratford
or
in
the
stratford
trust
case
and
also
distinguished
the
weil
case
and
it
said
those
cases
involved
deductions
in
arriving
at
taxable
income.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
real
deductions.
and
it
said
that
691
(c)
in
some
pickwickian
sense
perhaps
was
like
a
credit.
it
was
like
an
offset
to
the
capital
gain.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
indeed
it
is
and
as
you
know
the
united
states
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
accepting
that
line
of
cases
but
the
cases
themselves
distinguished
the
691
(c)
deduction
from
the
deduction
which
we
are
here
considering
and
i
think
properly
so.
i
think
that
the
cases
here
flow
from
the
same
or
the
decision
below
is
consonant
with
both
opinions
in
foster
lumber,
in
that
the
decisions
do
recognize
that
the
1201
(b)
computation
relates
to
all
capital
gains
without
subtraction
for
deductions
in
arriving
at
taxable
income.
the
special
691
(c)
deduction
i
think
can
be
explained
as
an
off
set
in
the
nature
of
the
credit
to
make
sure
that
items
which
were
taxable
were
subject
to
the
estate
tax
are
not
again
subject
to
an
income
tax
which
might
duplicate
and
indeed
exceed
the
principle
amount
of
the
item
itself.
there
are
special
considerations
there
which
i
think
just
are
not
present
in
any
of
the
so-called
ordinary
deductions
described
in
the
tax.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
assuming,
your
honor
if
i
may
add
one
more
fact
i
can
agree
with
you,
assuming
that
the
gross
income
of
the
estate
could
be
off
set
by
a
deduction
under
642
(c)
which
met
the
various
requirements
of
that
deduction
section
i
would
agree.
mr.
m.
carr
ferguson
well,
your
honor
again
i
have
to
disagree.
perhaps
i
can
offer
another
illustration
of
why
we’re
having
trouble
coming
to
a
common
agreement
as
the
nature
of
the
taxable
estate.
let
us
suppose
that
the
executor
had
the
duty
to
make
payments
from
income
or
corpus
as
necessary
to
provide
for
the
comfort
and
well
being
of
mrs.
disney
and
the
children,
but
that
any
amount
not
so
expended
would
then
be
left
in
its
entirety
to
charity.
in
that
case,
because
of
the
discretion,
the
conditions
in
642
(c)
would
not
be
met,
the
amount
going
to
charity
would
not
be
guaranteed
and
the
estate
would
be
fully
taxable
on
all
that
income,
there
would
be
no
refund
for
the
amount
--
excuse
me,
ultimately
determined
to
go
to
charity.
the
charity
indeed
would
take
the
amount
which
it
will
take
here
as
a
residuary
legatee
reduced
by
whatever
expenses,
including
income
tax
as
the
estate
encounters
during
the
course
of
administration.
i
think
that
in
every
case
even
the
extreme
case
you
have
suggested
of
an
estate
left
outright
to
charity,
the
estate
must
file
an
income
tax
return,
report
its
gross
income
and
demonstrate
that
the
income
earned
does
qualify
for
the
charitable
set
aside
deduction.

clearly
in
that
case,
the
lower
tax
would
be
the
regular
tax
and
there
would
be
a
zero
rate.

no
your
honor
we
don’t
feel
it
does,
we
think
that
that
has
been
decided
long
ago
that
the
placement
of
title
is
irrelevant
to
custody
and
management
of
the
assets
which
is
the
activity
generating
tax
liability
and
the
reason
that
congress
has
seen
fit
to
treat
the
estate
as
a
tax
payer.
now
the
--
if
i
may
return
for
one
moment
to
the
so-called
confusion
as
to
the
development
of
the
charitable
deduction,
i
think
that
the
preoccupation
of
the
second
circuit
and
of
counsel
for
the
tax
payer
on
section
643
and
the
computation
of
dni
is
irrelevant.
i
think
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
we
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
tax
payer's
version
of
the
computation
of
distributable
net
income
and
its
attack
on
the
example
which
we
set
out
in
our
brief
is
correct,
but
we
do
submit
that
that
is
just
utterly
irrelevant.
you
come
to
the
question
of
distributable
net
income
only
after
you
have
arrived
at
taxable
income
and
in
the
course
of
that,
the
taxable
income
of
the
estate
has
started
out
with
gross
income
which
includes
all
of
the
capital
gains
and
then
has
been
diminished
by
that
part
of
a
charitable
deduction
which
or
that
part
of
a
set
aside
for
charity
which
comes
out
of
gross
income.
and
it’s
only
at
that
point
after
you’ve
arrive
at
taxable
income
that
the
dni
or
distributable
net
income
adjustments
become
relevant.
we
suggest
that
the
only
point
of
looking
at
the
distributable
net
income
scheme
is
to
demonstrate
as
judge
sneed
did
that
the
only
conduit
theory,
the
only
distribution
theory
of
sub-chapter
(j)
has
to
do
with
private
beneficiaries
who
share
in
the
tax
load
to
the
extent
there
is
a
current
distribution
of
income.
to
the
extent
the
income
is
retained
that
remains
taxable
to
the
estate
regardless
of
how
it
is
ultimately
distributed
and
the
charitable
set
aside
deduction
of
642
(c)
is
simply
one
of
the
deductions
in
arriving
a
taxable
income.
when
you
go
to
look
at
the
alternative
tax
in
1201
(b),
we
suggest
that
there’s
no
more
reason
for
pulling
out
the
charitable
deduction
than
there
would
be
for
pulling
out
the
executors
commissions
which
maybe
deductions
in
looking
at
the
way,
the
computation
of
net
capital
gains
is
to
be
made.
we
suggest
the
court
was
quite
correct
in
its
assumptions
and
both
opinions
in
foster
lumber
that
net
capital
gains
means
net
capital
gains
for
purposes
of
the
alternative
tax.
thank
you
very
much.
