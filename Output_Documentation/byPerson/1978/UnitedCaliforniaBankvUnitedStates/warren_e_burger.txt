chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
hear
arguments
next
in
united
california
bank
against
the
united
states.
mr.
gother
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you’re
saying
when
you
say
that
is
that
the
tax
exempt
entity
is
the
de
facto
owner
from
that
instant
of
death,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
are
saying
that
congress
has
indicated
that
in
these
statutes
that
that
exemption
should
attached
from
the
outset
and
it
continue
wherever
it
goes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ferguson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
mr.
ferguson
about
justice
white’s
hypothetical
case,
if
the
entire
state
you
were
given
to
the
university
of
california
or
some
totally
recognizable
tax
entity
that
was
exempt,
income
on
these
earnings
during
the
period
of
probate
proceedings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
until
distribution,
the
entity
takes
on
the
cloak
of
the
decedent
and
not
the
cloak
of
the
legatee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
it
just
that
simple
in
the
long
run?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
it
has
the
same
status
under
that
theory
as
though
the
decedent
had
made
an
inter
vivos
gift
on
the
last
day
of
his
life?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
seem
to
agree
that
that
was
the
basic
intent
of
congress
to
put
the
ultimate
legate
to
the
legatee,
the
ultimate
distributee
in
the
shoes
of
the
--
just
who
made
the
gift
inter
vivos?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
hear
you
correctly
you’ve
answered
the
same
question
in
two
different
ways
now
mr.
ferguson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ferguson
earlier
i
said
you
seemed
to
answer
the
same
question
two
different
ways
and
i
realized
that
in
this
exchanges
here
a
word
here
or
there
can
make
the
difference
and
let
me
try
again,
even
if
there
is
an
over
simplification.
taking
mr.
justice
white’s
hypothetical
case,
mr.
disney
left
everything,
his
entire
estate
after
the
expenses
with
the
administration
to
this
tax
exempt
entity
charitable.
do
i
understand
you
to
concede
no
income
tax
during
the
pendency
of
the
probate
proceeding,
no
income
tax
after
the
date
of
death,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
tax
exempt
ultimate
to
distributees
takes
hold
at
the
instant
of
death,
rather
than
having
the
executors
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
decedent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
ferguson.
you
have
a
few
minutes
left
mr.
gother.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
to
avoid
double
taxation
of
the
taxable
distriburtee
in
part,
that
deduction
allowance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
it's
tax
in
your
estate
as
income
and
then
taxed
again
to
the
distributee
as
income?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
state
--
united
california
bank
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white
along
with
corbitt
against
new
jersey.
