rehnquist
this
maybe
elementary
mr.
ferguson,
but
i
take
it
the
governmentâ€™s
submission
is
and
perhaps
as
conceded
by
both
parties
that
for
income
taxation
an
estate
is
treated
as
an
entity
in
a
way
that
it
is
not
in
a
way,
in
most
states
for
purposes
of
decedents'
estates
where
you
have
the
executor
as
an
individual
and
the
distributee
as
an
individual,
but
the
estate
is
simply
an
accumulation
of
assets
for
income
taxation
an
estate
is
an
entity?
