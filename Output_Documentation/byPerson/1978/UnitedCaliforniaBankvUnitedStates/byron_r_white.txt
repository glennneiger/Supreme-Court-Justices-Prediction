so
they
wouldn’t
take
that
out
of
the
fiduciaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
part
of
capital
gain.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
you’re
saying
that
it
ought
to
be
the
same
for
both
thoughts
for
both
the
charity
and
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
government
says
that
they
can
be
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
government
position
doesn’t
reduce
the
amount
distributable
to
the
charity,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
just
that
there’s
not
much
and
there’s
just
less
money
in
the
estate,
i
mean
you
pay
out
more
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn’t
reduce
the
amount
distributable
to
the
charity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
in
this
case,
does
the
charity
hurt?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
--
in
this
case
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
that
current
income
is
distributable
to
a
charity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
is
what’s
the
estates
income
tax
for
a
year,
is
that
right?
for
particular
year,
is
that
the
question
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
an
income
tax
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
a
question
about
the
income
tax
of
an
estate?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
a
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
--
now
we're
together.
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
the
basis
in
this
case
for
saying
that
the
income
that
was
earned
in
the
years
in
question
was
distributable
to
a
charity?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
all
current
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
i
meant,
the
will
say
currently
distribute
this
year’s
income
to
a
charity
or
was
it
just
a
question
of
saying
whenever
you
call
the
estate
give
the
--
45%
of
the
residue
to
the
charity.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
i
die
and
i
have
a
business
in
my
--
i
tell
my
executor
operate
my
business
until
you
can
sell
it,
then
sell
it,
sell
all
my
stocks
and
bonds
and
then
take
the
cash
that’s
all
left
and
give
it
to
a
charity.
do
--
say
it’s
everything
to
a
charity.
now
is
there
--
does
the
estate
pay
any
income
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
the
charity
gets
only
the
residue
you
can’t
take
out
of
the
residue,
any
income
earned
before
you
distribute?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
argument
about
that
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
there’s
now
question
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
this
case
you
were
saying
that
the
government’s
position
in
effect
reduces
the
amount
distributable
to
the
charity
contrary
to
will
of
congress,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
make
the
same
contention
with
respect
to
the
word
excess
in
1202?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
pay
--
does
it
pay
taxes
or
doesn't
it,
on
its
current
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
it
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
while
the
state,
while
the
estate
is
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
essentially
you
agree
with
your
brother’s
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
qualification
that
it's
a
qualified
charitable
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
if
in
this
case
the
income
had
been
currently
distributable
in
these
years
to
a
charity,
would
you
agree
then
that
the
charity
should
be
treated
like
the
taxable
distributees?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
said
yes
from
your
description?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
california
bank
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
we
agree
to
take
and
review
the
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
had
arrived
at
a
different
answer
to
the
issue
involved
here.
that
issue
is
how
a
decedent's
estate
part
of
the
residue
of
which
is
reserved
for
charity
is
to
calculate
his
income
tax
for
years
in
which
it
has
substantial
long
term
capital
gains.
because
in
the
light
of
recent
amendments
to
the
tax
laws,
this
case
very
likely
has
no
prospective
significance
and
because
in
any
event,
it
would
not
measurably
advance
the
law
to
attempt
orally
to
explain
the
intricacies
of
this
case.
i
shall
simply
say
that
we
agree
with
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
with
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
for
those
interested
enough,
our
reasons
are
set
out
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk.
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stewart
and
rehnquist
have
joined.
