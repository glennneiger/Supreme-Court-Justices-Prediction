justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
mr.
gother.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
weil
case
is
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don’t.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
take
the
position
that
the
word
excess
of
a
long-term
gain
over
net
short-term
capitalized
means
thing
for
a
fiduciary
and
another
thing
for
an
individual
tax
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
fact
that
1201
(b)
refers
to
any
taxpayer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
1201
(b)
starts
out,
if
for
any
taxable
year
then
that
long-term
capital
gain
of
any
taxpayer
and
it
goes
on
and
i
would
read
it
as
prescribing
the
same
procedure
for
individual
taxpayers
as
for
fiduciary.
but
you
--
i’m
just
questioning
your
literal
argument
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
help
me
in
one
problem
i
have
with
the
whole
case.
one
way
of
stating
the
issue
for
the
year
1967
would
be
i
think
to
say
that
you
are
contending
that
the
word
excess
in
1201
(b)
1,
the
alternative
tax
computation,
this
$275,000.00.
the
government
contends
its
$500,000.00
because
you
take
the
45%
out
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
contend
its
$275,000.00
in
either
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
did
not
so
compute
it
when
you
stipulated
what
the
ordinary
tax
would
be,
that’s
one
thing
that
puzzled
me.
you
treated
this
$500,000.00
in
your
statement
of
why
you
have
to
use
this
--
the
1201
(b)
procedure
to
get
the
lower
tax,
you
agree
to
the
government’s
computation
under
1202?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn’t
follow
the
text
form
on
your
computation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see
what
my
problem
is?
i
think
you
stipulated
there
was
$500,000.00
under
1202
and
you’ve
argued
that
it’s
275
under
1201
(b)
and
i
don’t
know
how
you
can
have
it
both
ways?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
you’ve
made
an
unwise
stipulation
i
don’t
know
but
i
think
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
your
return
is
$500,000.00
for
that
purpose
by
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
your
return
used
$500,000.00
for
that
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
have
precluded
the
275
from
the
very
beginning
it
seems
to
me
and
had
quite
different
figures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fact
that
you
didn’t
suggest
it
to
me
that
you
thought
the
word
“excess”
had
a
different
meaning
in
the
two
different
sections.
now
you
say
that
really
isn’t
you’re
the
theory
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ferguson
is
that
quite
fair
to
treat
the
weil
case
because
that
wasn’t’
an
estate
case
obviously?
justice
john
paul
stevens
an
individual
so
it
really
didn’t’
present
this
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you’re
right
that
in
the
alternative
tax
computation
1201
(b),
you
do
not
reduce
capital
gains
by
deductions
which
maybe
taken
against
ordinary
income.
how
do
you
respond
to
the
argument
in
their
reply
brief
about
reducing
the
capital
gain
for
deductions
or
distributions
to
non-charitable
beneficiaries?
