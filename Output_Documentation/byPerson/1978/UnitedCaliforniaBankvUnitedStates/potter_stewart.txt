because
there
is
no
really
no
argument
about
any
of
these?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
not
thought
so
either.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
a
requirement?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
that
difference
mr.
ferguson
that
makes
you
say
that
the
administrative
practice
with
respect
to
non-charitable
distributees
described
in
your
petitioner’s
reply
brief
is
not
inconsistent
--
under
which
you
basically
do
follow
the
conduit
concept,
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
arguments
you’re
making
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
that
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
that
a
charity
cannot
be
a
beneficiary
or
is
not
a
statutory
beneficiary?
justice
potter
stewart
and
distributees
are.
justice
potter
stewart
real
deductions?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it’s
called
the
deduction?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it
does
in
the
chief
justice’s
question
even
though
the
entire
income
is
capital
gains
income,
you
wouldn’t
need
the
alternative
tax,
you
would
just
make
the
deduction
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
regular
tax
without
the
alternative
tax,
without
any
you’re
required
to
figure
the
alternative
tax
i
guess
but
you’d
figured
and
discard
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
some
deductions
are
unlimited?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
are
limitations
for
another.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
your
second
point
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
contrary
to
the
ordinary
concept
of
a
deduction?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
have
to
say
just
before
you
sit
down
mr.
gother
about
then
mr.
ferguson’s
explanation
of
the
administrative
practice
pointed
out
in
your
reply
brief
that
you
assert
is
inconsistent
with
his
--
the
position
of
the
government
takes
in
this
case.
you
know
what
i’m
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government's
treatment
of
non-charitable
devices,
legatees,
distributees
is
said
to
be
in
your
--
administratively
as
said
to
be
in
your
reply
brief
inconsistent
with
the
argument
that
the
government
is
making
in
this
case
in
that,
that
administrative
treatment
of
non-charitable
distributees
seems
to
rely
upon
or
recognize
the
conduit
theory
and
now
you
heard
mr.
ferguson’s
explanation
of
the
difference,
i.e.
that
charities
are
not
beneficiaries
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
that
that
explains
the
difference
in
practice
which
he
concedes
does
not
follow
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
with
the
respect
to
non-charitable
distributees
but
what
