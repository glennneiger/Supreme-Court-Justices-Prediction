mr.
ronald
e.
gother
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
involved
the
estate
of
walt
disney.
under
mr.
disney’s
will,
he
provided
that
45%
of
the
residue
of
his
estate
was
to
pass
to
the
disney
foundation
where
it
was
to
be
held
for
certain
charitable
and
educational
purposes
primarily
for
the
support
of
california
institute
of
the
art,
a
school
which
he
helped
to
found.
during
1967
and
1968,
the
executors
of
his
estate
sold
stock
of
walt
disney
productions
at
a
substantial
gain.
in
computing
its
tax
for
those
years
in
which
the
gain
was
incurred,
the
state
excluded
from
tax
45%
of
the
gain,
being
the
gain,
which
was
permanently
set
aside
for
and
would
ultimately
pass
to
the
charity,
and
paid
tax
therefore
on
only
55%
of
its
gain.
such
55%
passed
basically
to
taxable
taxpayers,
a
trust
for
the
family
of
walt
disney.
the
irs
has
taken
the
position
that
if
the
estate
wanted
to
exclude
45%
of
the
gain
which
was
passing
to
charity,
that
in
computing
it’s
tax
on
the
55%
of
the
gain
passing
to
taxable
beneficiaries,
it
had
to
compute
such
gain
--
it
could
not
use
i
should
say,
it
could
not
use
in
computing
the
tax
on
such
gain
the
alternative
tax
rate
which
during
those
years
placed
a
25%
limit
on
the
amount
of
tax
on
capital
gains.
what
the
internal
revenue
service
said
was
that
if
you
wanted
to
use
the
25%
tax
rate,
that
tax
rate
must
be
applied
against
100%
of
the
gain,
including
the
45%
of
the
gain
that
passed
to
charity.
while
the
facts
in
the
case
are
easy
to
understand,
unfortunately,
the
law
is
not,
and
this
is
due
to
some
very
complex
style
of
legislative
drafting
and
also
to
the
interrelationship
of
several
different
code
sections.
i
believe
that
the
taxpayer
has
accurately
interpreted
these
code
sections
and
put
together
the
puzzle
of
these
code
sections
in
a
way
that
carries
out
the
intent
of
congress
and
makes
sense.
and
i
would
say
that
the
correctness
of
our
interpretation
must
be
judged
against
the
two
basic
intents
of
congress
which
are
quite
evident
from
this
particular
fact
pattern.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
i
believe
it
has
no
significance
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
first
is
that
it
was
dealing
with
entirely
different
set
of
code
sections.
we
were
not
--
it
was
not
dealing
with
the
charitable
set
aside
deduction.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
it
was
not
dealing
with
the
taxation
of
within
an
estate,
which
is
i
think
a
major
factor
here.
it
was
dealing
with
the
carrying
back
of
a
loss
carrying
back
to
a
prior
year
during
which
the
taxpayer
calculated
his
tax
using
the
alternative
tax
rate.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor
at
all.
i
think
also
that
our
interpretation
of
the
code
is
a
literal
one
in
that
we
are
literally
interpreting
our
code
section
correctly
and
that
the
government
is
not.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
in
part
there,
in
part
and
whether
that
conduit
system
is
applicable
to
the
1201
(b)
(2)
alternative
tax
rate
calculation,
yes.
foster
lumber
is
no
different
than
the
weil
case
in
essence
that
you
had
an
excess
of
an
ordinary
deduction
which
you
couldn’t
use
against
your
alternative
tax
rate
and
that
was
a
regular
ordinary
loss
carry
forward
deduction.
i’m
saying
that
our
charitable
set
aside
deduction
is
an
entirely
different
animal.
that
it
is
not
an
ordinary
deduction
that
an
individual
taxpayer
individual
or
corporate
such
as
in
foster
lumber
had,
but
it
is
a
different
type
of
deduction
and
it
is
more
of
a
manifestation
of
this
conduit
theory.
also
in
foster
lumber
the
issue
was
the
definition
of
taxable
income.
well,
if
there’s
anything
that
is
relatively
clear
in
the
internal
revenue
code
is
the
definition
of
taxable
income
and
i
don’t
believe
that
that
is
in
issue
here
at
all.
we
say
there
are
two
basic
intents
of
congress
here
that
are
evident.
one
is
that
there
is
to
be
no
tax
imposed
on
that
part
of
any
capital
gain
which
an
estate
realizes
or
any
income,
which
an
estate
realizes,
be
it
ordinary
or
on
capital
gain,
which
passes
ultimately
to
a
charity.
642
(c)
of
internal
revenue
code
says
that
any
gain,
any
income,
any
item
of
income
gain
or
ordinary
income
which
is
permanently
set
aside
for
charity
is
entitled
to
a
100%
deduction,
even
though
it’s
not
paid
out.
so
that
we
have
a
100%
deduction,
whether
we
pay
it
or
don’t
pay
it
out
in
the
particular
year.
it’s
referred
to
as
the
set
aside
deduction.
it's
perfectly
clear
from
that
that
intent
of
congress
was
to
exempt
from
tax
that
part
of
income
realized
by
a
fiduciary.
the
second
intent
of
congress,
which
is
perfectly
evident,
is
that
capital
gains
were
to
be
taxed
in
those
years
at
a
maximum
of
25%.
now
you’ve
got
these
two
intents
and
i
believe
they
are
perfectly
reconcilable
in
our
case
and
in
due
--
and
our
interpretation
carries
both
to
those
out.
the
government's
does
--
the
government’s
interpretation
does
violence
to
one
if
not
both
of
those.
the
basic
issue
which
separates
our
self
and
the
government
is
best
explained
in
the
question
of
whether
the
capital
gains
tax
base
for
computing
the
alternative
tax
rate
under
section
1201
(b)
2
includes
the
gain
going
to
the
charity.
this
is
by
far
the
biggest
area
of
disagreement
between
ourselves
and
the
government.
section
1201
(b)
is
set
forth
on
pages
8
(a)
and
9
(a)
of
the
appendix
of
the
government
brief.
before
getting
into
the
specific
language
of
those
sections,
i
think
it’s
essential
to
take
--
stand
back
just
a
bit
and
take
a
look
at
what
is
the
over
all
concept
of
the
taxation
of
estates
and
trusts.
we
have
a
peculiar
system
of
taxation
here
because
we
have
interposed
a
fiduciary,
a
third
party
here.
we
don’t
have
a
taxpayer
and
his
tax.
we
have
a
fiduciary
and
the
system,
the
basic
system
for
taxation
of
estates
or
trusts
is
first
you
determine
what
part
of
the
income
that
the
fiduciary
realizes
is
either
required
to
be
distributed
or
will
be
distributed
or
is
distributed
to
a
taxable
beneficiary
and
that’s
one
set
of
income
and
you
put
that
of
to
a
side.
the
next
is
that
you
look
to
see
if
there
is
any
income
permanently
set
aside
for
charity,
under
642
if
it
is,
you
set
that
aside.
you're
then
left
with
a
third
group,
a
third
body
of
income
that
is
taxed
to
the
fiduciary
and
then
the
question
is
what
tax
rate
applies
to
that
tax
income.
now
you
go
to
section
1201.
1201
(b)
says
that
if
you
have
some
capital
gains
in
that
year,
you
compute
your
tax
in
a
two-step
approach.
you
divide
this
taxable
income
that
i
have
over
here
into
its
component
parts.
the
first
part
being
ordinary
income,
the
second
part
being
capital
gain,
and
you
do
that
by
taking
the
taxable
income
that
you
had
here
and
deduct
out
the
part
that
is
capital
gain
and
on
the
remaining
part
you
compute
your
tax
at
your
ordinary
income
rate,
that’s
your
ordinary
income.
the
part
that
is
capital
gain,
you
then
tax
at
a
maximum
of
25%.
now
our
position
is
that
if
you
look
at
1201
and
apply
it
literally
to
what
is
the
taxable
income
of
the
estate,
our
interpretation
is
as
literal
as
any
interpretation
can
be
of
that
code
section
that
the
capital
gains
referred
to
in
that
section,
the
long-term
capital
gain
is
the
long-term
capital
gain
that’s
in
this
part
taxable
to
the
estate.
it’s
not
in
the
part
that’s
going
out
to
the
taxable
beneficiaries.
it’s
not
the
gain
that’s
in
the
part
over
here
for
charity
and
the
best
way
i
think
i
can
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
no.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
it’s
just
not
in
a
fiduciary
context.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
i
believe
that’s
correct.
because
we
have
a
fiduciary.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
any
taxpayer?
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
well
i
think
you’re
talking
about
the
taxable
income
of
that
taxpayer.
if
you
look
at
1201
(b)
1
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
well,
my
literal
argument
says
that
--
of
any
taxpayer
is,
it
presupposes
that
you’re
talking
about
the
taxable
income
of
that
taxpayer
not
in
the
fiduciary
context.
so
that
in
the
fiduciary
context
that
is
literally
being
applied
to
this
other
part
of
income
that’s
over
here,
not
to
these.
and
i
think
another
way
of
emphasizing
then
is
look
at
1201
(b)
1
which
now
talks
about
the
computation
of
the
partial
tax.
the
partial
tax
is
computed
on
taxable
income.
well
again,
that
has
got
to
be
the
taxable
income
that
is
taxed
to
the
taxpayer.
it
can’t
be
some
taxable
income
that’s
sitting
over
that’s
taxed
to
somebody
else.
it
seems
to
me
we
are
applying
it
as
literally.
let
me
show
you
that
the
government
doesn’t
apply
that
literally.
it
doesn’t
even
come
close
to
applying
it
literally
in
the
context
of
gain
which
is
set
aside
or
a
gain
which
is
to
be
distributed
or
is
distributed
to
a
taxable
taxpayer.
remember
i’ve
got
that
gain
sitting
over
here.
if
we
had
gain
that
is
to
being
distributed
to
a
taxpayer,
a
taxable
taxpayer,
it’s
sitting
over
in
this
other
pile.
the
government
doesn’t
contend
that
when
you
compute
the
1201
tax
that
this
reference
to
the
excess
of
capital
gains
of
excess
long-term
capital
gain
includes
that
taxable
gain
that
goes
over
the
taxpayer.
no,
that
is
already
out.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
they
would.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
and
yet
if
you
want
to
read
that
as
literal
as
the
government
seems
to
read
it
literally
that
shouldn’t
happen,
that
the
tax
should
be
on
25%
of
the
100%
of
the
gain.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
that’s
exactly
my
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
i
haven’t
seen
that
in
their
briefs
but
we
have
computed,
we
have
given
a
exhibit
in
our
reply
brief
of
the
instructions
in
computing
your
tax
under
1041
and
in
the
example
of
working
it
out
in
the
form.
the
court
in
statler
made
the
same
observation
and
i
don’t
anticipate
that
the
government
would
refute
that.
so
they’re
not
applying
it
literally.
they’re
not
even
applying
it
literally
in
another
context
and
that’s
in
the
context
of
the
691
deduction.
691
deduction
is
a
for
the
amount
of
the
state
tax
attributable
to
income
in
respect
of
a
decedent
item.
there
are
series
of
cases
which
says
that
that
deduction
if
it
relates
to
capital
gain
taxable
to
an
estate,
that
deduction,
the
word
it
is
a
deduction,
works
as
an
exclusion
from
the
capital
gains
tax
base
and
the
government
itself
in
(inaudible)
case
argued
that
that
691
deduction
reduced
the
capital
gains
tax
based
from
a
100%
to
something
less
than
a
100%.
so
clearly
the
literal
interpretation
is
not
one
which
is
there
for
the
government.
our
interpretation
it
seems
to
me
is
--
as
literal
as
theirs
and
ours
does
no
offense
to
the
basic
contents.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
well,
that’s
correct
that’s
their
position
here
is
that
no
the
charities
are
somehow
different.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
you
pay
out
more
tax.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
that
would
depend
upon
how
the
tax
is
allocated
under
your
will,
how
the
tax
burden
is
allocated.
they
are
either
taxing
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
yes,
any
tax
payable
out
in
the
residue
of
this
estate
is
going
to
reduce
the
amount
going
to
charity
under
the
terms
of
mr.
disney’s
will.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
the
will
is
specific
and
that
the
charity
shared
in
the
net
residue,
45%
of
the
net
residue
this
would
be
a
residue
charge.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
yes
it
is
your
honor.
one
of
the
--
getting
to
the
conduit
argument,
one
other
point
that
i
want
to
emphasis
very
much
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
government
both
contend
that
this
conduit
principle
doesn’t
apply
to
the
amount
going
in
this
part
over
here
in
the
charity
and
they
cite
as
example
of
that
section
643
(a)
3.
now
643
(a)
3
has
a
very
complex
section,
but
the
position
they
take
is
that
that
section
provides
that
capital
gains
that
are
in
the
pot
going
to
charity
are
included
or
added
to
distributable
net
income.
that
is
absolutely
wrong,
absolutely
wrong.
if
you
read
through
643,
643
starts
with
the
concept
of
taxable
income.
you
have
some
taxable
income
now
and
you
want
to
determine
how
much
of
that
taxable
income
is
going
to
be
taxed
to
a
taxable
beneficiary.
so,
taxable
income
already
has
a
distributions
deduction
off,
already
has
a
charitable
deduction
off
and
so
you’ve
got
to
get
--
you’ve
got
to
kind
of
gross
this
back
up
to
see
how
much
is
going
to
be
taxed
to
the
beneficiary.
and
in
the
process
of
grossing
up,
one
of
the
things
that
they
gross
up,
or
one
of
the
things
they
do
is
that
643
(a)
3
says
you
exclude
all
capital
gains.
so
you
--
they
were
in
taxable
income
but
now
you
got
to
take
them
out.
when
you
take
them
out,
if
you
take
out
a
100%
of
capital
gain,
you
already
--
you
would
take
out
also
those
capital
gains
which
are
going
to
charity
which
would
mean
--
but
they
are
already
out
of
taxable
income
so
you
will
be
taking
them
out
twice
if
you
did
that
so
the
statute
has
a
double
negative
in
there
and
they
said
no,
no,
don’t
take
out
all
the
capital
gains,
leave
in
their
the
capital
gains
that
are
going
to
stay
in
the
trust
and
are
going
to
be
taxable
to
the
trust
and
the
gains
that
are
permanently
set
aside
for
charity,
those
having
already
been
deducted
above.
so
you
cannot
contend
that
distributable
net
income
includes
any
capital
gains
passing
to
charity.
it’s
a
basic
error
in
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion,
a
basic
error
in
the
government’s
brief.
as
example
of
that
--
the
ninth
circuit
then
goes
on
to
say
another
example
of
why
the
conduit
theory
doesn’t
apply
to
this
part
of
gain
going
--
setting
aside
for
charity
over
here
is
that
section
663
(a)
2
says
that
in
--
662
(a)
2,
says
that
when
you
are
going
to
allocate
distributable
net
income
in
a
particular
circumstance
among
taxable
beneficiaries,
you
take
distributable
net
income
and
then
it
says
(and
add
to
it)
the
amount
of
the
deduction
that
you
have
taken
for
charity
under
642
(c).
well
obviously
distributable
net
income
therefore
doesn’t
include
anything
going
to
charity
for
the
limited
purpose
of
662
they
add
--
have
that
added
back.
so
basic
error
that
643
does
not
provide
that
distributable
net
income
includes
an
amount
going
to
charity.
the
limited
purpose
of
this
add
back
in
662
of
the
642
charitable
deduction
has
nothing
to
do
with
estates
as
such.
the
very
solemn
could
apply
to
the
estates
has
something
to
do
with
taxable
income
of
trusts
and
has
to
do
with
this
concept
of
a
tier
beneficiaries
that
they
wanted
to
make
sure,
congress
want
to
make
sure
that
the
income
tax
--
that
the
taxable
beneficiary
for
whom
income
was
required
to
be
distributed
would
pay
the
tax
on
the
maximum
taxable
income
not
reduced
by
anything
that
was
permanently
set
aside
for
charity
and
it
just
sets
up
an
order
of
priorities
as
we
see
it
of
this
policy.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
excuse
me,
i’m
not
sure
i
followed
the
question.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
keep
going
again,
i’m
still
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
yes
it
is.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
yes.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
for
a
year.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
okay.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
the
terms
in
the
will
provide
that
45%
of
our
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
that
would
include
current
income.
that
just
a
matter
of
state
law,
45%
of
the
current
income,
45%
of
the
principle
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
it’s
the
latter.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
no
it
does
not
your
honor,
never.
that’s
the
essence
of
the
642
(c),
642
(c)
charitable
deduction
is
an
unlimited
deduction
and
it
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
that’s
the
law,
the
law
would
say
that
all
of
the
in
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
no,
all
of
the
income
earned
during
the
course
of
the
estate
proceeding,
in
an
estate
where
the
will
provides
that
ultimately,
all
of
the
assets
are
to
pass
to
charity,
all
of
the
income,
even
if
that
estate
were
open
ten
years
would
be
free
of
tax.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
no
question
about
that.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
we
are,
we’ve
even
cited
the
probate
code
section
in
california
which
embodies
that
concept
that
in
an
estate
proceeding,
the
assets
of
an
estate
really
title
vest
in
the
beneficiary
subject
only.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
exactly.
that’s
exactly
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
it
has
to,
yes
your
honor.
i’d
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
remaining
for
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
that’s
right.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
identical.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
not
when
we
get
to
the
computation
of
the
alternative
tax?
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
only
because
that
was
the
way
the
form
is
set
up.
we
were
not
doing
it
because
we
were
saying
that
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
no
we
did
not,
we
couldn’t.
we
had
to
--
the
computation
that
we
use,
we
had
to
exclude
at
some
point
this
45%
of
the
gain
go
into
charity.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
well,
that’s
because
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
perhaps
i’m
not
sure,
but
maybe
the
confusion
is
with
the
1202
section
itself,
the
amount
that
passes
to
charity
in
the
capital
gain
situation
really
gets
deducted
the
way
the
code
sets
it
up
in
two
categories.
a
half
of
that
capital
gain
gets
deducted
in
the
642
(c)
charitable
deductions
and
the
other
half
in
the
1202.
now
those
two
inter
relate
in
643
--
642
has
a
cross
reference
to
the
1202
but
you’re
taking
it
both
places.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
pardon,
excuse
me?
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
what
we
have
--
because
we
had
to
get
all
of
the
game
going
out
to
charity
deducted
out
in
two
places.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
yes
we
could
have.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
came
up
in
the
ninth
circuit
argument.
we
could
have
in
the
very
basic
capital
gain
schedule
when
we
had
500,
we
could
have
deducted
45%
there
and
then
went
on
with
the
calculation.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
if
you
did
one,
i
prepared
the
tax
return
i
changed
my
mind
at
this
point
in
time.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
thank
you
your
honor,
just
one
quick
point.
don’t
be
misled
by
the
use
of
the
word
“deduction”
in
642.
642
speaks
of
it
in
terms
of
a
deduction
and
i
think
government
is
emphasizing
that
word
more
than
need
be.
642
provides
for
an
unlimited
deduction
and
it
provides
that
it
is
available
even
if
there
is
not
a
distribution.
you
put
those
two
concepts
together
and
you
got
something
other
than
a
deduction.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
some
deductions
are
unlimited
--
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
--
but
only
if
you
pay
them
out.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
my
second
point
is
that
you
don’t
even
have
to
pay
it
out,
but
it’s
on.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
also,
the
deduction
that
you
get
for
distributing
amounts
to
a
taxable
beneficiary
under
661
to
a
taxable
beneficiary
is
worded
as
a
deduction.
same
word
“deduction,”
but
it
works
to
take
that
capital
gain
out
as
an
exclusion.
so
don’t
be
misled
by
the
words
deduction.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
no.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
charitable
entity
doesn’t
need
this
deduction,
this
distribution.
it
is
not
a
--
it
doesn’t
need
to
be
a
distributee
to
get
the
deduction.
the
taxable
beneficiary
needed
that
and
that’s
the
conduit
which
carries
the
taxable
amount
off
to
the
taxable
beneficiary.
the
charity
because
of
the
fact
that
it
gets
this
deduction
without
a
distribution
just
didn’t
--
just
wasn’t
unnecessary
to
deal
with
a
charitable
entity
as
being
a
distributee.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
no
i
don’t
think
it
relates
to
the
double
tax
issue.
mr.
ronald
e.
gother
oh
yes
that‘s
right,
you
need
the
distribution
out
to
cause
--
to
eliminate
the
double
tax
on
that
and
in
the
case
of
the
charity,
you
don’t
have
that,
you’re
not
eliminating
a
double
tax.
thank
you,
your
honor.
