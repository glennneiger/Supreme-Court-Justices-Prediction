mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
few
cases
raised
a
variety
of
different
issues
and
i
thought
it
might
be
useful
to
briefly
sketch
out
what
they
are.
first,
there
is
a
statutory
claim
in
this
case
is
which
has
the
chief
justice
noted
in
the
last
argument
ordinarily
as
a
claim
to
this
result
prior
to
decision
in
any
constitutional
claims.
we
alleged
that
under
section
2
or
the
voting
rights
act,
the
at-large
election
is
using
these
cases
violates
section
2
and
we
rely
in
particular
on
statement
by
attorney
general
katzenbach
which
is
quoted
by
this
court
in
footnote
31
in
allen
which
says
that
section
2
covers
purpose
or
effect
that
it
has,
i
would
paraphrase
that,
the
same
meaning
of
section
5
does
but
with
a
different
burden
of
proof.
second,
there
is
a
constitutional
claim
under
white
against
regester.
now,
with
regard
to
that,
we
are
in
agreement
with
the
government
that
we
seek
only
to
apply
decisions
of
this
court
in
white
and
before
and
after
it
which
i
think
it
fairly
well-established.
we
are
in
disagreement
with
the
government
which
reads
some
intent
requirement
in
to
white.
we
see
no
intent
requirement
in
white
and
we've
set
out
at
length
in
our
brief
why.
third,
we
claim
that
in
this
case
is
the
systems
election
are
maintained
because
of
a
deliberate
decision
to
keep
blacks
from
public
office.
we
maintained
that
the
hypothetical
posed
by
justice
stevens
is
in
fact
the
case.
mr.
eric
schnapper
excuse
me?
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
our
answer
would
be
slightly
different
in
the
two
cases,
i
mean
we
would
say
the
state
in
the
constitutional
sense
but
i
think
that
it
is
more
complex
than
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
right.
in
--
in
the
case
in
the
city
case
the
as
mr.
justice
stevens
noted,
those
direct
testimony
by
members
of
legislature
who
were
there
at
the
time
the
decisions
are
made
not
to
authorize
single-member
districts,
although
that
decision
was
made
for
racial
reasons
and
they
were
made
essentially
by
the
members
of
legislature
from
mobile.
that's
the
way
the
legislature
operates.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that
seems
to
be
an
important
part
of
analysis
of
the
school
board
case.
it
is
not
critical
to
the
analysis
of
the
city
case.
in
the
school
board
case,
we
have
a
rather
complicated
serious
facts
which
are
set
out
in
our
brief
involving
the
introduction
and
passage
of
deliberately
defective
legislation
in
the
legislature
in
order
to
prevent
the
federal
litigation
from
going
forward
and
that
becomes
i
think
the
operative
decision
and
as
a
practical
matter
of
those
decisions
were
made
by
the
defendant
school
board
members
and
it
is
their
contention
below
and
i
think
correctly
that
they
were
calling
the
shots
in
the
legislature
about
what
was
being
introduced
in
the
past.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
do
not
want
to
recount
there.
the
history
of
discriminatory
devices
that
have
exists
in
alabama
over
the
years.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
i
think
this
intentional
scheme
to
discriminate
on
the
part
of
the
state
wouldn't
work
if
you
did
not
also
have
black
vote.
mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
that
if
we
are
right
and
mr.
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
was
the
case
mainly
that
this
election
system
is
being
maintained
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
keeping
blacks
and
being
elected.
a
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
officials
of
the
state
of
alabama,
that
that
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
i
had
nothing
in
this
decision
of
this
court
suggest
that
a
motive
to
--
a
racial
motive
which
is
not
denying
in
nature
but
here
clearly
vicious
can
somehow
rather
be
sanctioned
because
it
only
works
because
of
private
discrimination
as
well.
i
think
that
it
would
be
analogous
to
a
situation
where
for
example
the
state
as
happened
in
1903
expressly
authorized
the
state
parties
to
exclude
the
voters
on
the
basis
of
race
and
then
the
parties
did
that.
i
mean
there
was
such
action
which
was
less
state
action
than
the
actions
of
the
legislature
although
it
may
be
for
constitutional
purposes
that
was
also
state
action
with
the
part
even.
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
part
of
the
cause
on
mechanism
is
of
any
relevance.
i
think
the
state
acts
from
hostile
racial
motive
that
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
fifteenth
amendment
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
in
addition,
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
have
a
situation
here
exactly
like
arlington
heights.
in
arlington
heights
there
had
been
a
zoning
classification,
the
court's
opinion
show
if
not
win
in
origin.
but
a
dispute
arose
as
to
the
decision
of
arlington
heights
not
to
change
the
zoning
classification
and
the
court
held
and
i
think
properly
that
if
that
refusal
to
change
had
been
racially
motivated,
the
zoning
would
have
been
unconstitutional
and
it
was
of
no
importance
when
or
how
that
zoning
classification
had
come
into
existence
and
that's
our
contention
here.
we
just
ask
you
in
that
regard
to
follow
arlington
heights.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
--
i
think
the
question
would
be
who
are
the
people
that
actually
making
a
decision.
if
the
legislature
effectively
delegates
control
over
this
to
a
single
legislature
as
indeed
exists
in
alabama.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
way
the
system
works
is
ability
of
the
sort
affecting
--
ability
affecting
the
situation.
affecting
only
mobile
would
have
to
be
approved
by
the
legislative
delegation
from
mobile
and
of
course,
the
role
in
the
senate
is
that
that
any
single
member
of
the
state
senate
can
veto
a
mobile
bill
and
that's
precisely
what
happened.
so
it
was
one
center.
the
question
is
not
one
of
numbers;
the
question
is
who
is
making
the
decision
on
behalf
of
the
state?
mr.
eric
schnapper
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
in
that
way
but
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
the
--
your
honor,
if
the
state
of
alabama
and
the
legislature
delegates
the
authority
for
making
decision
to
one
member
of
legislature
and
the
district
court
found
that
that
was
a
case
and
it's
not
with
finding
it's
contested
then
the
motives
of
the
person
that
makes
that
decision
is
the
operative
motive
for
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
eric
schnapper
what?
and
i
think
you're
bound
by
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
they
could
have
changed
their
mind
but
they
didn't.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
no
other
conceivable
rule
is
possible.
i
mean
otherwise
you
could
simply
nullify
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
systematically
referring
any
legislation
as
you
wanted
to
undertake
with
it's
nullify
motive
to
single
legislative
who
would
then
act
from
racial
motives
and
then
that
you
come
in
to
defend
the
suit
and
say
well
you
know,
it
was
only
senator
so
and
so,
and
the
rest
of
us
never
even
thought
of
that.
i
mean
that
just
would
be
i
think
a
rule
that
would
be
an
invitation
to
evasion
of
constitutional
commands
in
this
area.
finally,
i
was
just
trying
to
sketch
out
here
what
the
arguments
were
presented
by
the
case.
there
is
a
claim
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
as
i
think
mr.
turner
noted
that
is
somewhat
narrower
in
its
impact
than
our
claim
under
white
against
regester
because
of
course
it
would
be
in
limit
as
to
racial
issues.
both
government
and
we
contend
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
not
limited
to
nstances
of
discriminatory
purpose.
i
think
we
have
a
somewhat
different
approach
to
it.
we
were
like
particularly
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
concern
of
the
product
congress
by
adopting
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
ensure
that
blacks
were
armed
with
an
effective
franchise
by
which
they
could
protect
themselves
against
government
discrimination.
we
think
the
record
clearly
shows
that
they
do
not
have
that
in
this
case.
the
government
advances
an
argument
i
think
closer
to
that
suggested
by
mr.
justice
white
to
wit
that,
we
have
something
here
at
akin
to
the
terry
against
adams
and
that
is
and
i
think
you
were
articulating
it
of
the
democratic
party
has
picked
its
candidates
on
the
basis
of
race
and
that
decision
is
effectively
state
action
because
it
controls
the
outcomes
of
the
elections.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
it
is
as
free
and
open
as
the
primary
in
bexar
county,
texas
which
this
court
unanimously
held
violated
white
against
regester
and
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
not
in
bexar
county,
only
in
dallas
county.
mr.
eric
schnapper
b-e-x-a-r,
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
what?
san
antonio.
the
--
there
was
this
in
expressed
finding
effective
to
recent
slating
in
that
case
and
i
thing
that's
quite
clear.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
was
slating
in
dallas.
there
was
not
slating
in
bexar
county.
there's
not
slating
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
an
active
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
i
think
we
are
in
agreement.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
there
is
none.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no
claim
of
that.
well,
there's
a
little
claim
of
that
on
the
part
of
the
other
side
but
they
certainly
present
that
on
their
own.
mr.
eric
schnapper
in
the
case
of
this
--
in
the
case
of
the
(inaudible),
i
don't
believe
so.
my
understanding
is
that
its
just
an
ordinary
primary
you've
got
to
be
dominated
by
one
of
the
parties
and
nomination
by
the
democratic
parties
equivalent
of
election.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
there's
a
general
election
but
it's
often
uncontested.
it
was
uncontested
this
year
for
example.
mr.
eric
schnapper
you
get
the
nomination
to
republican
party.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
non-partisan
voters,
they
gets
in
a
party,
it
was
private
organization
that
endorse
people.
mr.
eric
schnapper
what?
mr.
eric
schnapper
only
if
they
can
get
a
party
to
nominate
and
they
are
like
the
ffl
or
any
public
interest
group.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
has
to
be
a
party.
well,
those
are
the
four
claims
before
the
court.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
record
does
not
reflect
to
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
may
be
procedure
that
sort
of,
it
was
not
part
of
the
case
as
it
was
litigated
below
it's
not
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
oh!
i'm
sorry.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
our
claim
is
that
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
prohibits
the
state
from
adopting
election
systems
which
have
a
discriminatory
effect
and
this
we
claim
is
such
the
system.
that
--
that
doctrine
is
somewhat
different
than
the
doctrine
we
find
in
white
against
regester
for
variety
of
reasons
not
the
list
of
which
this
that
it
is,
why
is
it
limited
to
the
problem
of
at-large
election
systems?
the
fifteenth
amendment
will
cover
any
election
law
but
on
the
other
hand
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
limited
to
questions
of
race.
mr.
eric
schnapper
for
purposes
of
my
motive
argument,
i
would
say
adopted
or
maintained,
yes.
with
regards
to
the
fifteenth
amendment,
we
place
particular
emphasis
on
the
phrase
on
two
things
first.
these
are
the
phrase
abridge
in
the
language
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
if
you
recall
the
history
of
the
times
when
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
adopted
there
was
nothing
then
towards
that
could
correspond.
the
south
was
under
the
control
of
the
union
army
and
blacks
were
free
to
vote
everywhere.
the
concern,
i
think
we
think
of
congress
in
adding
the
word
abridge
was
not
merely
that
when
the
whites
came
back
and
the
power
after
reconstruction
they
would
strip
blacks
of
the
right
to
vote
of
all
but
that
new
forms
of
discrimination,
new
devices
might
be
adopted
that
had
these
kinds
of
impact.
i
know
justice
white
that
there
was,
i
think
an
understandable
concern
in
washington
against
davis
about
the
ramifications
of
having
an
effect
to
one
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
would
call
on
the
question
wide
variety
of
governmental
programs,
housing,
taxes,
and
all
sorts
of
things.
and
we
think
that
those
problems
aren't
raise
by
the
effect
to
what
we
urge
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it's
our
contention
--
it
obviously
its
scope
would
be
limited
to
claims
of
discrimination
in
voting
and
we
think
it
appropriate
that
a
voting,
the
blacks
be
protected
in
voting
to
a
greater
degree
than
other
areas.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
i
mean
that's
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
is
it.
the
role
of
state
is
in
creating
and
maintaining
the
at-large
system.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
at
this
point.
well,
there's
one
other
point
i
think
which
does
separate
us
from
the
appellants
in
both
of
these
cases.
i
think
we
have
a
very
different
view
of
what
were
the
appellate
courts
are
in
resolving
these
cases.
i
think
it
--
listening
to
their
argument
i
had
sense
that
we
were
back
on
the
trial
court
and
that
you
are
sitting
easy
prayers
or
perhaps,
writing
circuit
as
occurred
in
the
old
days.
i
think
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
that
role
of
the
court
is
more
limited.
that
absent
some
sort
of
palpable
error
which
i
don't
think
is
present
here
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
really
do
have
to
be
accepted.
in
our
view,
they
are
sufficient
to
manage
judgment
for
us.
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
you
hold
that
--
let
me
make
sure
that
is
right
that
the
district
court
didn't
find
intent
but
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
intent.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
do
not,
well
that's
not
under
the
two-court
rule.
i
think
in
all
candor
that
the
practice
of
the
court
in
that
situation
is
to
come
very
close
to
putting
itself
in
the
shoes
of
the
court
of
appeals.
so
i
don't
think
the
same
difference
would
exist
if
it
were
merely
a
court
of
appeals
finding
of
intent.
mr.
eric
schnapper
washington
against
davis
was
decided
before
the
cases
went
to
trial
and
so
at
time
the
cases
went
to
trial
there
was
already
a
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
you
needed
intent
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
maintain
there
as
do
now
that
the
equal
protection
clause
has
two
distinct
branches.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
surprising
of
this
case
is
only
four
years
old.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
the
ordinary
practice
of
the
court
is
the
same
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that's
several
questions.
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
answer
them
all.
first,
i
think
that
the
first
question
you
probably
ought
to
reach
consistent
with
the
general
practice
of
the
court
would
be
the
statutory
issue
and
i
say
it
not
because
we
prefer
to
win
on
one
theory
or
not
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
is
a
direct
appeal
but
i
think
the
court's
normal
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
we
are
entitled
as
we
are
in
any
case
to
urge
in
support
of
the
decision
below
any
ground
that
was
raised
below.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
--
and
that's
where
the
ground
was
raised
below.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
have
no
right
to
that
and
no
intention
of
trying
to
do
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
i
--
i
meant
only
to
recall
to
you
the
normal
practice
of
the
court
which
is
to
decide
statutory
issues
first.
we
have
no
preference
on
that,
if
you
want
to
decide
the
most
sweeping
constitutional
issues
then
the
narrow
constitutional
issues
then
the
statutory
issues
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
our
position.
so,
now
--
but
i
think
you
had
another
question
i
don't
think
i
fully
answered.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
the
truth,
right.
our
position
would
be
that
the
two-court
rule
is
as
applicable
here
as
always.
the
two-court
rule
does
not
preclude
you
from
deciding
constitutional
issues.
it
--
it
only
suggests
that
with
regards
to
specific
factual
matters
that
you
generally
uphold
the
findings
of
the
two
courts
below
unless
there
is
an
unusual
circumstance.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
is
our
contention
that
they
are
indeed
enough
and
they
are
enough
under
white
against
regester,
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
although
for
somewhat
different
reasons
because
the
rational
of
each
of
those
rules
is
different.
with
regard
to
that
i
think
perhaps
i
should
answer
a
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
earlier
about
zimmer
versus
mckeithen.
the
--
both
parties
in
court
of
appeals
relied
on
zimmer
against
mckeithen
and
you
will
find
in
the
brief
for
the
school
board,
the
statement
which
says
they
think
zimmer
against
mckeithen
is
correct.
i
think
we
were
all
obligated
to
operate
in
the
context
of
zimmer
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
think
here,
it
is
indeed
argue
that
zimmer
was
too
constricted
in
its
application
of
white
against
regester
and
that
that
left
proof
is
required
and
is
elaborated
in
zimmer
and
we
also
have
disagreement
with
the
part
of
nevett
against
sides
which
is
of
course
subsequent,
which
holds
that
intent
is
in
fact
necessary
under
white
or
zimmer.
we
say
there's
a
reason
for
that
contention
in
our
brief
at
length.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
touch
very
briefly
on
our
claim
under
the
voting
rights
act
which
we
think
is
the
issue
which
the
court
ought
to
begin.
we
--
we've
--
we've
noted
that
the
legislative
history
on
this
matter
as
such
as
this
quite
clear
that
attorney
general
katzenbach
testified
on
the
very
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
covered
purpose
and
effect
and
it
said
that
it
did.
we
think
if
we're
at
the
substantive
standard
under
the
voting
rights
act
under
section
2
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
substantive
standard
under
section
5
which
is
to
say
that
if
the
election
law
permits
white
voters
to
nullify
the
electoral
preferences
of
blacks
that
it
falls
under
the
voting
rights
act.
the
difference
--
the
only
difference
that
we
see
between
section
5
and
section
2
is
a
procedural
one.
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
state
under
section
5,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff
under
section
2.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
it's
almost.
i
think
the
word
almost
appears
and
i
think
that's
--
the
value
of
that
is
little
hard
to
know
because
nobody
i
think
at
that
point
necessarily
knew
what
the
fifteenth
amendment
mean.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
he
said
purpose
or
effect.
he
was
quite
clear
about
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
currently,
the
congress
does
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
not
in
--
not
in
the
senate.
not
in
the
senate.
if
we
write
in
our
contention
the
standard
of
section
2
and
section
5
are
the
same
then
i
think
there
was
also
the
case
would
be
clear.
i
think
if
alabama
had
exempted
to
switch
to
the
system,
from
the
single-member
system
there'll
be
no
question
that
they
couldn't
do
it
and
we
think
section
2
invalidates
it
for
that
reason.
mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
turning
to
the
substantive
issues
presented
by
the
case,
i
think
it
might
be
useful
to
lay
out
some
of
the
procedural
problems
about
the
way
the
court
will
choose
to
address
the
variety
of
issues
presented
here.
some
of
them
have
come
up
before,
some
of
them
have
not.
one
issue
which
mr.
allen
raised
and
which
has
been
raised
by
earlier
questions
is
--
is
whether
or
not
to
deal
with
the
statutory
question
that
is
i
think
unquestionably
presented
by
the
case.
the
court
has
for
many
years
maintained
a
policy
which
it
has
attempted
to
persuade
the
lower
courts
to
follow
of
deciding
statutory
issues
first
and
only
reaching
constitutional
issues
if
necessary.
as
this
case
and
beazer
and
bakke
all
illustrate
the
lower
courts
have
not
been
assiduous
in
attending
to
that
rule.
and
the
--
the
question
before
the
court
is
--
is
how
the
court
is
to
act
when
the
lower
court
has
not
followed
your
preferred
procedure.
i
think
that
there
are
three
options,
one
of
which
should
not
be
taken.
the
one
that
should
not
be
taken
is
the
--
is
the
option
taken
in
arlington
heights,
which
is
to
decide
the
constitutional
question
and
remand
for
decision
on
the
statutory
question.
as
you
may
remember,
after
ruling
for
the
defendants
on
the
constitutional
question
in
that
case
that
an
opinion
which
provoked
some
dissents
and
made
a
lot
of
law
that
may
or
may
not
--
had
not
been
necessary,
on
remand
the
district
court
of
appeals
reached
the
statutory
issue
ruled
for
the
plaintiff
and
this
court
denied
search.
so
that
an
entire
opinion
with
all
its
ramifications
and
we
deal
with
many
of
them
today
was
unnecessary.
i
think
that
--
that
following
that
course
would
be
unwise
not
only
because
it
leads
you
into
deciding
unnecessary
issues
but
because
it
doesn't
--
i
would
lead
the
courts
of
appeals
by
example
and
that
was
not
the
kind
of
example
i
think
you
wanted
to
give
them.
and
i
think
the
two
options
you
have
are,
first,
and
i
think
this
is
probably
the
proper
option
to
do
what
you
did
in
bakke,
to
decide
the
statutory
issue
first,
reach
the
constitutional
issue
if
necessary.
or
you
could
wipe
the
whole
case
out
and
send
it
back
and
tell
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
it
right
the
first
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
--
i
think
they've
got
to
look
through
a
different
volume.
they've
got
to
look
through
the
appendix
and
take
a
look
at
the
complaint.
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
it's
in
the
complaint
that's
one
thing.
i
would
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
would
be
listing
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
the
--
the
practice
of
this
court
has
generally
not
been
to
permit
litigants
to
raise
issues
which
in
no
way
have
been
raised
below.
so
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
and
i
think
consistent
with
the
past
practices
of
the
court
that
if
a
litigant
wanted
to
raise
a
statutory
issue
which
had
in
no
way
been
raised
by
the
complaint
or
briefs
below,
to
preclude
them
from
--
from
doing
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
would
think
that
would
be
terribly
unwise
and
i
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
--
i
would
say
it
was
an
error
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
done
that.
i
think
it
would
be
entirely
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
refuse
to
entertain
a
new
statutory
claim
for
the
--
in
the
first
instance
here.
on
the
other
hand,
quite
frankly,
there
have
been
cases
where
you've
chosen
to
entertain
new
statutory
issues
for
reasons
having
to
do
with
subsequent
developments
and
--
and
also
some
suggest
--
i
wouldn't
want
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
suggest
that
you
lock
yourself
into
a
ritual
that
you'll
never
do
that.
i
think
you've
got
--
you
ought
to
retain
the
power
to
go
either
way.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
depends
--
then
i
would
deny
cert.
mr.
eric
schnapper
because
it
was
a
defendant's
cert
petition.
they'd
won
below,
and
you
can't
file
--
at
least
i
have
not
taken
the
filing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
if
the
defendants
had
wanted
to
come
in
and
concede
the
existence
of
a
private
--
of
a
statutory
claim
and
won
and
asked
for
a
decision
on
the
constitutional
claim,
i
assume
the
district
court
would
have
accepted
their
concession,
ruled
for
the
plaintiffs,
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
can't
imagine
why
a
district
judge
facing
a
concession
of
liability
under
statute
would
decide
a
constitutional
issue
as
well.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
--
just
--
no
district
judge
it
seems
to
me
would
be
--
would
act
properly
to
let
the
--
the
defendant
control
the
order
of
decisions
and
to
ignore
the
policies
of
this
court
to
decide
statutory
issues
first.
that's
the
rule
from
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
there
are,
too,
and
there
are
some
courts
of
appeals
judges
who
don't
and
that's
--
and
that
it
is
from
that
point
that
i
began
my
suggestion
that
you
deal
with
this
the
way
you
wanted
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
to
deal
with
it
and
that
is
to
decide
the
--
the
statutory
issue
first.
the
--
the
second
problem
pertains
to
something
quite
related
to
this
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
new
issues
can
be
raised
for
the
first
time
here
on
appeal
and
we've
got
two
things
that
seem
to
be
in
that
posture.
the
first
one
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
white
against
regester
apply
--
in
the
doctrine
therein
applies
to
municipal
governments.
this
case
is
in
precisely
the
same
posture
as
wise
against
lipscomb.
it
was
never
raised
below
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
the
policy
of
this
court
is
not
to
permit
things
to
be
raised
at
the
last
moment
and
--
and
we
think
you
should
adhere
to
that.
on
my
reading
of
the
record,
the
same
thing
is
true
about
whether
or
not
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
under
section
2.
as
you
recall,
with
the
exception
of
mr.
justice
stewart,
most
members
of
the
court
were
of
the
view
in
bakke
that
that
issue
not
having
been
raised
below
could
not
be
raised
in
that
particular
case
at
the
first
instance
here.
and
we
think
that
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
private
cause
of
action
under
the
voting
rights
act
is
in
that
posture
--
in
the
same
posture
that
the
private
cause
of
action
under
title
6
was
in
bakke.
now,
i
--
i
say
that
without
meaning
to
signal
any
lack
of
confidence
in
our
argument
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action,
but
again
as
a
procedural
matter
the
court
has
practices
which
would
be
applicable
to
the
--
to
dealing
with
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
right,
just
like
the
trial
court
in
bakke
didn't
rest
on
the
statute.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
(voice
overlap)
--
as
i
recall,
they
--
they
didn't
think
a
whole
lot
of
the
argument
but
there's
a
--
as
i
remember,
there
was
a
companion
case
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--
(voice
overlap)
explain
why
they
didn't
want
to
reach
the
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
don't
think
you
could
read
that
into
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
--
i
think
--
i'm
trying
to
give
you
an
agenda
of
the
problems
in
the
case
and
that's
one
of
the
issues
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--
you're
going
to
have
to
--
to
sort
out.
i
think
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
if
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
that's
right.
that's
right.
there's
no
question
about
that.
third,
there's
a
--
there's
a
problem
raised
in
both
of
the
cases
here
about
what
we
referred
to
loosely
as
the
two-court
rule.
for
--
with
regard
to
our
particular
cases,
i
think
particularly
justice
stevens'
questions
have
pointed
out,
we
maintain
that
there
is
a
finding
of
intentional
discrimination.
and
mr.
allen
takes
the
position
that
if
there
is
such
a
finding
it
isn't
justified
on
this
record.
if
the
court
were
sitting
nisi
prius
or
you
were
righting
a
circuit,
of
course
we
would
be
in
a
very
different
posture
than
we're
in
now.
but
the
normal
practice
of
this
court
and
the
salutary
practice
of
that
is
not
to
get
into
factual
issues
of
that
sort
when
they've
been
resolved
by
the
lower
courts.
the
factual
record
on
which
the
district
court
finding
is
based
is
much
more
substantial
than
mr.
allen
suggests.
there
was
first
direct
testimony
by
members
of
the
legislature
as
to
the
motives
of
the
legislature
in
dealing
with
redistricting
legislation.
there
was
a
long
history
of
racial
discrimination
in
alabama
including
a
number
of
cases
in
which
multi-member
districting
plans
adopted
by
the
state
legislature
had
been
held
by
federal
courts
in
other
cases
to
have
been
racially
motivated.
and
the
discriminatory
impact
of
this
system
on
blacks
was
not
only
--
is
not
only
pronounced,
it
was
known
to
everybody
in
the
state
and
to
the
school
board
at
the
time.
so
that
this
case
presents
all
the
kinds
of
evidence
which
arlington
heights
suggested
were
--
were
relevant
to
this
sort
of
inquiry
and
we
think
the
district
judge
had
no
choice
but
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
he
did.
finally,
there
is
a
--
there's
a
problem
here
that
really
is
--
fairly
characterizes
the
problem
of
stare
decisis
and
it
goes
particularly
to
--
to
whether
white
is
--
white
against
regester
is
good
law.
the
briefs
deal
with
this
in
somewhat
greater
length
and
the
arguments
have
until
now.
i
think
the
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
excuse
me?
still
in
existence
or
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
both
of
those
things.
the
--
as
we've
noted
in
our
brief,
white
against
regester
was
based
on
a
series
of
decisions
before
then.
it's
been
cited
with
approval
in
half
a
dozen
decisions
since
white,
some
of
them
after
washington
against
davis.
white
itself
was
a
unanimous
decision
and
a
decision
only
six
years
ago.
and
we
think
the
court
should
not
entertain
a
general
practice
of
--
of
reopening
recent
constitutional
decisions
and
--
and
this
one
we
suggest
was
in
an
--
in
any
event
quite
properly
decided.
we
also
note
that
the
argument
against
for
overturning
white
is
really
two
legs.
one
of
them
is
that
washington
against
davis
has
--
has
somehow
rather
changed
the
underlying
law
in
this
area.
we've
suggested
in
our
briefs
that
washington
against
davis
and
--
and
white
against
regester
deal
with
two
different
branches
of
equal
protection
law
that
washington
against
davis
is
concerned
with
the
branch
of
equal
protection
law
forbidding
racial
classifications
whereas
white
against
regester
is
part
of
the
reynolds
against
sims
branch
of
equal
protection
law
concerning
special
protections
for
particularly
important
and
fundamental
rights.
the
other
basis
of
the
attack
on
white,
and
one
which
i
think
has
been
recurrent
in
the
questions
before
the
court
today,
is
whether
white
makes
any
sense.
and
--
and
i
think
our
arguments
about
wouldn't
all
this
go
away
if
blacks
lived
everywhere
and
can't
blacks
be
elected
in
los
angeles
and
the
like,
and
all
of
which
i
think
on
the
merits
are
--
are
unpersuasive.
in
the
final
analysis,
there
are
arguments
that
white
against
regester
was
wrongly
decided.
and
--
and
we
think
that
the
court
ought
not
be
entertaining
that.
i
think
we
--
you
should
start
with
white
against
regester,
enforce
it
and
we
think
it
would
be
dispositive
to
this
litigation.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
--
on
other
issues
that
arose
earlier.
when
we
were
here
in
the
spring,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
whether
in
--
well,
he
raised
the
following
question,
we
were
discussing
apparently
inconsistent
statements
about
the
voting
rights
act.
attorney
general
katzenbach
was
quoted
by
our
side
as
--
as
stating
that
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
encompassed
the
purpose
or
effect
standard.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
noted
that
senator
dirksen
had
made
a
remark
about
section
2
almost
meaning
the
same
thing
as
--
as
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
i'd
like
to
return
to
that
subject
because
i
think
it's
important
particularly
in
view
of
my
position
that
the
statutory
issue
ought
to
be
decided
first.
if
you
will
revert
to
the
dirksen
quote,
you'll
notice
that
it
doesn't
happen
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
it
happens
during
a
hearing,
indeed
the
very
hearing,
almost
at
the
very
hour
when
katzenbach
testified.
dirksen
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
and
was
according
to
the
transcript,
in
the
room
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing.
dirksen
sat
there
while
katzenbach
said
section
2
means
purpose
or
effect.
a
few
pages
later,
senator
dirksen
says
the
fifteenth
amend
--
section
2
means
almost
the
same
thing
as
the
fifteenth
amendment.
now,
either
those
people
just
--
one
has
to
try
to
reconcile
those
statements
and
of
course
one
could
reconcile
them
by
accepting
our
view
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
but
i
think
that
--
that
the
government's
footnote
and
justice
stevens'
opinion
in
bakke
suggest
a
more
sensible
resolution
of
it
which
is
to
say
that
those
two
statements
were
regarded
by
their
spokesmen
as
--
as
consistent
with
one
another.
because
congress
at
that
point
in
time
regarded
section
2
in
--
as
incorporating
the
purpose
or
effect
standard
which
they
thought
was
in
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
there's
a
passage
in
--
justice
stevens,
in
your
opinion
in
bakke
which
describes
title
vi
in
the
same
kind
of
way,
but
--
but
suggests
that
title
vi
has
independent
force
and
it
doesn't
merely
incorporate
whatever
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
be
held
to
mean
by
this
court,
without
wanting
to
get
it
--
reopen
the
particular
issues
that
were
involved
in
bakke.
i
think
that
method
of
analysis,
however
persuasive,
run
persuasive
in
bakke
is
the
correct
method
of
analysis
here.
the
second
thing
that
--
that
comes
out
when
you
reread
that
passage
is
the
context
in
which
it
was
made.
as
you
will
doubtless
recall,
one
of
the
primary
arguments
that
was
made
against
the
voting
rights
act
was
that
it
was
regional
in
nature.
that
it
only
--
that
it
singled
out
a
group
of
southern
states
for
treatment
different
than
the
treatment
of
--
that
was
being
afforded
to
the
rest
of
the
country.
senator
dirksen,
in
--
in
making
that
remark
about
section
2,
makes
it
--
in
the
context
of
a
paragraph
in
which
he
says
look
at
section
2,
section
2
covers
texas,
as
you
recall,
texas
was
the
big
bone
of
contention
because
the
president
was
from
texas
and
it
wasn't
(inaudible)
section
2
covers
texas,
so
that
--
so
texas
is
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act,
too.
now,
if
--
if
section
2
is
merely
the
fifteenth
amendment
in
a
purposes
standard,
then
that
statement
makes
no
sense
at
all
but,
if
it
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
--
the
dispute
was
about
whether
the
--
why
the
voting
rights
act
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
sir.
but
the
--
the
criticism
that
was
being
made
about
the
voting
rights
act
was
that
section
5
didn't
apply
to
all
states.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
in
response
to
that,
dirksen
said,
“oh,
yes,
but
section
2
does
so
the
act
applies
all
over.”
now,
if
section
2
had
no
substantive
force
at
all,
if
it
had
a
different
standard
than
section
5,
a
lower
standard,
the
only
purpose
would
give
you
a
cause
of
action.
then
it
wasn't
a
very
--
and
that
was
the
same
standard
as
the
fifteenth
amendment,
than
to
say
section
2
covers
texas
so
the
act
applies
there
was
rather
--
is
rather
unpersuasive
because
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--
section
2
wasn't
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
it
didn't
make
sense
as
an
argument
unless
it
meant
some
--
it
meant
the
same
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
as
an
argument
to
convince
other
members
of
the
committee
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
as
rhetoric
to
convince
other
members
of
the
committee
that
--
that
the
act
was
--
was
equally
applicable
to
all
states,
that
only
makes
sense
if
the
substantive
meaning
of
section
2
was
the
same
as
the
substantive
meaning
of
the
provisions
which
applied
to
the
southern
states.
and
as
we've
noted
in
our
brief,
the
history
of
the
voting
rights
act
reflects
great
sensitivity
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
the
possibility
of
a
regional
rule.
we
don't
think
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
except
in
the
very
narrow
area
which
we
have
noted,
having
to
do
with
literacy
tests,
to
create
a
situation
in
which
the
same
sort
of
districting
system
would
be
illegal
in
prince
edward
county,
virginia
and
legal
in
prince
george's
county,
maryland.
and
we
don't
think
congress
should've
presumed
to
have
made
that
kind
of
distinction
unless
it's
crystal
clear
that
it
did.
so
that
we
--
that
we
find
the
--
the
dirksen
statement
consistent
with
the
katzenbach
statement
and
with
our
view
of
the
law.
in
addition
--
well,
justice
stevens,
you
asked
earlier
what
the
relevance
of
intent
was
and
it's
a
rather
complicated
problem
which
i'd
like
to
deal
with
very
--
very
briefly.
it's
complicated
because
it's
relevant
to
a
--
to
a
whole
host
of
issues.
this
is
a
case
that
presents
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
sure.
mr.
eric
schnapper
absolutely
not.
it
was
entirely
irrelevant.
as
we've
laid
out
in
our
brief,
this
court
has
three
times
described
the
rule
in
white
as
a
rule
that
means
--
that
is
--
in
these
terms,
designedly
or
otherwise
diluting
the
block
vote.
white
--
whitcomb
began
with
a
statement
that
it
was
conceded
that
there
was
no
discriminatory
intent
and
then
went
on
to
write
for
four
or
five
pages.
so
i
think
it
is
crystal
clear
that
intent
was
no
part
of
the
white
against
regester
holding.
with
regard
to
the
relevance
of
intent
here,
this
is
a
case
as
we
noted
in
the
spring
that
raises
five
or
six
different
legal
theories
and
intent
is
of
different
relevance
to
the
--
to
various
of
them.
with
regard
to
our
claim
that
this
election
system
is
intentionally
maintained
to
prevent
the
election
of
blacks,
the
relevant
intent
--
discriminatory
intent
is
the
intent
of
the
people
who
make
laws.
i
phrase
it
that
way
because
the
--
the
practical
political
control
of
the
legislative
process
is
rather
complicated,
involves
primarily
the
legislative
delegation
to
a
significant
extent,
in
this
case
the
school
board
itself.
but
--
and
so
i
don't
phrase
it
in
terms
of
the
legislature,
but
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
way
you
were
phrasing
the
question
earlier.
with
regard
to
our
claim
under
white
against
regester,
it
is
our
position
that
--
that
racial
discrimination
by
the
elected
officials
is
of
some
relevance
to
proving
the
cause
of
action
which
we
think
we've
proved
here.
we
don't
think
it
is
of
much
importance
as
--
as
zimmer
against
mckeithen
does.
we
think
that
racial
discrimination
by
the
all-white
elected
government
tends
to
confirm
our
claim
that
they
are
essentially
elected
solely
by
the
whites
and
are
solely
responsive
to
the
whites
in
town.
with
regard
to
our
fifteenth
amendment
claim,
in
--
in
arguing
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
covers
discriminatory
effect,
we've
resorted
in
particular
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
pointing
out
that
the
framers
of
that
amendment
were
concerned
to
protect
not
the
right
of
blacks
to
put
x's
on
pieces
of
paper
but
to
give
blacks
a
right
that
would
allow
them
to
protect
themselves
from
racial
discrimination
by
state
and
local
governments,
particularly
at
the
end
of
reconstruction
which
everybody
by
1869
or
1870
knew
was
inevitable.
if
--
if
we
are
correct
in
--
in
that
construction
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
then
it
would
--
it
would
demonstrate
the
--
the
particular
relevance
of
the
effect
meaning
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
the
right
to
vote
such
as
it
exists
in
mobile
for
blacks
is
clearly
not
carrying
out
the
effect
of
congress,
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
gomillion
is
fairly
described
as
opaque.
one
must
recall
that
at
the
time
of
gomillion
there
were
decisions
of
this
court,
a
line
of
decisions
which
continued
up
until
palmer
against
thompson
and
o'brien
against
united
states,
which
suggested
that
--
that
an
inquiry
into
the
intent
of
legislature
was
impermissible.
so
that
as
of
the
date
of
gomillion,
opinions
were
being
phrased
rather
carefully
so
they
didn't
exactly
find
intent
and
they
didn't
exactly
find
purpose,
they
were
just
sort
of
outraged
and
said
you
couldn't
do
it
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--
and
i
think
gomillion
is
in
that
posture.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
--
i
couldn't
read
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--
gomillion
in
--
in
that
way.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
don't
read
gomillion
in
that
way.
i
mean
i
--
i
think
that
was
the
intent
involved,
but
i
think
that
the
--
the
opinion
is
--
is
phrased
to
avoid
making
that
kind
of
statement.
it
would've
--
at
the
time
have
been
quite
arguably
improper
to
make
--
to
put
that
kind
of
conclusion
of
law
in
an
opinion.
mr.
eric
schnapper
thank
you
very
much.
