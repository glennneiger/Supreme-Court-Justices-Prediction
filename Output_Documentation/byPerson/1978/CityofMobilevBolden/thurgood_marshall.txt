justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

your
polarization
changes,
what

kkk.
justice
thurgood

1500

justice
thurgood
marshall
i've
seen
the
newspaper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
local
news.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
communist

justice
thurgood
marshall
in
new
york,
the
communist
got
elected
ever
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
was
it
prevented

doing
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
negroes
weren't
allowed
to
elect
the
man
of
their
own
choice
and
my
question
was
how
were
they
denied
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
understand
from
mr.
rhyne
that,
maybe
you
can
help
him,
he
wants
to
know
the
constitutional
division
that
prevents
white
people
for
voting
for
white
people
and
negro
or
black
people
from
voting
for
black
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
so.
you
agree
with
doing
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fifteenth
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
explicit
on
that
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
a
block
voting
for
that
on
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
take
and
you
don't
read
mr.
rhyne
anymore?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
negroes
in
the
state
legislate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
been
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
fred
gray
has
been
there
at
least
a
dozen
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
you
find
a
single
word
in
any
of
those
white
primary
cases
that
apply
to
the
city.
i
have
serious
doubt,
it
were
limited
to
united
states
senators,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
the
election
complained
about
was
in
national
election,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right
but
in
elections
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
united
states
senate
wasn't
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allen,
it
just
so
happened
that
there
weren't
any
negroes
in
the
democratic
part.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
shouldn't
he
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
just
so
happened
that
there
weren't
any
negroes
in
any
democratic
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
was
a
democratic
party
that
controlled.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
a
republican
ever
get
elected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
he
was
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
negroes
there
have
access
to
that
slate
in
mobile?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
for
my
question
is
right
from
left,
come
at
the
slate,
the
group
that
has
put
up,
the
group
that
is
always
elected.
the
negroes
in
mobile
have
never
gotten
on
that,
have
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
please,
at
the
end
on
the
slate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
judgment
for
the
slate,
didn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
polling
booth
pick
the
slate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
slate
had
been
picked
by
a
group
of
people
in
the
democrat,
is
it
or
isn't
that
then
the
democratic
party
in
mobile
that
did
it
or
maybe
on
the
democratic
part?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
that
the
judge
know
more
about
it
than
you
and
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
the
fifteenth
amendment
doesn't
require
state
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
presumed
by
whom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
has
continued
and
keep
them
from
voting,
the
city,
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
is
maintaining
this
discrimination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
mobile
controls
the
legislature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
legislatures
do
you
need
to
maintain
your
point
of
majority?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
legislature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
can
say
that
the
whole
legislature
of
alabama
including
fred
gray
is
guilty
of
racial
prejudice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
think
you
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we're
bound
by
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
happens
after
the
democratic
primary
by
the
school
board?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
it
is
contested,
why
do
you
contest
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
non-partisan
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
they
get
somebody
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
get
somebody
on
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
to
be
a
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
mechanism
for
the
nominated
by
petition
after
the
primary
or?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
adopt.
sdo
you
mean
you
maintain,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
bearing
in
mind
that
this
is
a
direct
appeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
it
that
we
are
limited
from
changing
under
your
concept
of
the
two-court
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
the
first
thing
you
got
to
pass
on
is
the
constitutionality?
the
first
thing,
we
have
passed
are
direct
appeal,
don't
we?
and
secondly,
we
don't
have
the
power
the
two-court
rule
on
constitutionality,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
direct
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
before
us
on
a
direct
appeal?
that
constitutionality
of
a
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
sure
but
i
don't
think
you
are
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
think
you
have
the
right
to
prevent
us
from
considering
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that's
involved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
--
in
your
record
that
shows
who
pays
for
all
of
this
advertising,
their
political
stuff?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
who
pays
for
these
advertisements
and
other
things
that
normally
help
in
political
campaigns?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
think
i
know
enough
about
politics
that
money
doesn't
come
out
of
the
clear
blue
sky.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
doesn't
(voice
overlap)
