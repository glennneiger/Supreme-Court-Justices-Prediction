the
case
is
submitted
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
1844,
city
of
mobile
against
bolden
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
rhyne
we'll
wait
for
the
court
going
to
be
clear
a
little
bit.
i
think
we
may
proceed
now
whenever
you're
ready
mr.
rhyne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
there
are
common
denominator
in
terms
of
having
them
exercise
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
both
executive
and
legislative
functions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
common
denominator
of
the
commission
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
form,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
indicated
before
that
the
distinguishing
factor
perhaps
was
that
this
people
exercise
both
legislative
and
the
executive
functions
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
differed
that
distinguished
it
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
qualification
factor
is
relevant
here
at
all
---
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
only
evidence
of
qualification
is
that
the
three
negroes,
who
run,
you
said
according
to
this
record,
did
not
carry
the
negro
or
doting
wards
and
isn't
that
about
all,
we
can
deal
with
on
qualifications?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
not
the
record
here
--
is
not
the
record
here
that
the
three
negro
candidates
didn't
carry
the
negro
wards
in
conflict
to
some
extent
with
the
district
court's
finding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
blacksher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
city
do
a
general
utterly
or
does
it
take
for
state
legislative
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
inferences
should
be
drawn
if
any,
from
the
fact
that
if
you
had
district
representation
here
the
three
negro
candidates
run
would
not
have
been
elected
in
their
own
predominantly
negro
districts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
come
back
to
what
i
suggested
to
you
before
about
the
fact
that
three
negroes
candidates
couldn't
even
carry
their
own
districts
and
you
responded
by
saying
that
the
--
at
least
as
i
understood
it,
that
the
negro
leaders
in
the
community
knew
that
it
was
a
futility
to
run
and
so
they
didn't
bother
putting
up
good
candidates
but
that's
a
good
deal
of
speculation,
that's
really
not
hard
evidence.
your
--
your
whole
arguments
about
block
voting,
block
voting
are
undermined
by
this
reality
that
is
in
the
record
that
the
negroes
did
not
vote
for
negro
candidates.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
turner.
we'll
resume
at
1
o'clock
at
this
point.
we'll
you
be
continuing
or
will
you
be
reserving
any
time
you
have
left
or
mr.
turner,
i
guess
it
would
appear
that
you're
on
deck.
he's
got
two
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
before
you
go
into
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
--
it's
more
likely
than
not,
isn't
it
that
where
the
function
is
legislative
and
executive,
that
is
to
have
to
commissioners
or
councilmen
assigned
to
be
the
chief
executive
of
a
particular
department
that
that's
very,
very
large
number
of
municipal
governments
today,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
anyone
would
have
a
complaint
pursuant
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
point
more
fully
with
this
hypothetical?
the
governor,
the
lieutenant
governor,
the
attorney
general
being
regarded
as
three
of
the
most
important
positions
in
the
state
government
surely,
all
the
elected
at-large
as
they
are
i
suppose
everywhere
where
they
are
elected,
doesn't
it
produce
the
same
impact
in
the
statewide
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
southern
third
of
the
state
is
all
people
with
spanish
surnames
and
one
of
the
first
or
second
generation
mexican-americans,
they
aren't
going
to
on
theory,
they
have
been
advanced
here
as
they,
they
aren't
going
to
have
much
chance
of
electing
a
governor,
lieutenant
governor
or
an
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
the
governor
has
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
when
he
can
veto
a
bill
that
gives
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
turner
do
you
agree
with
one
of
the
earlier
observations
that
if
the
residential
pattern
of
mobile
was
totally
integrated.
totally
integrated
there
would
be
a
delusion
of
the
voting
strengths
that's
being
argued
for
here
today
of
negroes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
objective.
that's
certainly
the
objective
is
it
not
to
produce
that
kind
of
city
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
doesn't
the
contrary,
isn't
that
the
corollary
that
the
result
you're
arguing
for
would
encourage
the
maintenance
of
ghettos
in
order
to
maintain
voting
strength.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rhyne,
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
these
members
performed
no
executive
functions
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
usual
reasons
for
at
least
whether
you
are
thought
to
be
the
usual
reasons,
people
running
for
public
office
that
pay
us
30-40,000.00
a
year
or
even
25,000.00
aren't
present
in
the
school
board
election?
chief

e.

it's
just
work
and
public
service?
chief

warren
e.
burger
dedication.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
allen.
mr.
schnapper.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
then,
i
take
it,
relate
the
historic
hostile
motive
of
what
existed
back
in
1826
and
1836
due
to
a
hostile
motive
today
because
the
legislature
did
not
change
the
structure
--
we
have
a
different
kind
of
discrimination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
from
the
legislature
as
a
whole
in
your
hypothetical
your
explanation
delegated
that
power
to
one
man
they
in
advanced
adopted
the
action
he
was
taking
in
the
motives
that
motivated
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
1844,
city
of
mobile
against
bolden
and
the
consolidated
case
of
williams
against
brown.
mr.
rhyne,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
blacksher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
the
executive
functions
of
the
commissioners
and
particularly
of
the
one
who
is
the
mayor
from
the
executive
functions
of
the
governor
of
a
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
percentage
--
what
percentage
--
does
this
record
show
what
percentage
of
the
negro
voters
actually
vote?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
all
of
the
negroes
registered
and
all
of
them
voted,
isn't
it
likely
that
they
could
on
this
record
elect
at
least
one
commissioner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
know
they
found
it,
but
does
this
--
did
they
find
it
with
respect
to
that
proposition
that
if
every
negro
eligible
to
register
did
register
and
every
registered
negro
voter
negro
voter
voted,
did
they
make
a
finding
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
does
that
--
does
that
inference
--
finding
by
inference
that
you
suggest
stand
--
stand
up
under
a
mathematical
analysis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
catholics
in
mobile,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
show
how
many
there
are?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
turner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
mormons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
turner,
you
speak
for
the
united
states
here,
for
the
department
of
justice.
now,
over
recent
years
the
federal
government
has
engaged
in
a
great
many
activities,
legislative,
executive
and
otherwise
to
--
to
ensure
the
rights
of
minorities
to
have
housing
in
--
in
an
integrated
way
with
all
other
people.
is
that
not
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
if
you
succeed
in
that
enterprise
widely,
then
district
--
or
elections
won't
help
very
much,
will
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
not
that
it
is
right
now,
but
if
you
succeed,
if
your
objective
is
a
sound
objective,
and
--
and
congress
has
decided
that
it
is,
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
insistence
on
a
program
that
will
furnish
an
incentive
for
people
of
a
particular
category
to
live
in
enclaves,
whether
they
be
indians,
puerto
ricans,
orientals,
spanish
surnamed
people,
whatever?
how
do
you
reconcile
these
two
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
state
law
or
federal
law
that
--
that
would
prohibit
that
process
of
circulating
it
in
other
districts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
district
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
district
elections
wouldn't
help
that
situation,
would
it?
women
don't
tend
to
live
in
particular
enclaves
or
ghettos.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
turner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rhyne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
those
exhibits,
mr.
rhyne,
do
show
that
apparently
there's
some
evidence
that
there
was
block
voting
on
racial
lines
there,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
rhyne.
mr.

you
may
proceed

chief

whenever

ready.
chief

it
a
