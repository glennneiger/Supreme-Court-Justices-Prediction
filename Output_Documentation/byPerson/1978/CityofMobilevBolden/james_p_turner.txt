mr.
james
p.
turner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
appear
as
amicus
to
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgments
below
in
both
numbers
77-1844
and
78-357
which
will
be
argued
next.
although
there
are
slight
differences
in
the
legal
analyses
which
are
apparent,
i
believe,
from
the
briefs
we
concur
fully
with
the
appellees
that
the
maintenance
of
the
at-large
voting
system
for
mobile
city
commission
and
school
commission
in
all
circumstances
of
these
cases
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
and
alternatively
and
independently
the
fifteenth
amendment.
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause,
our
analysis
like
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
accepts
the
fact
that
washington
versus
davis
requires
aggrieved
parties
to
make
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the
challenged
system
is
purposefully
discriminatory.
our
submission
is
that
the
exhaustive
records
in
these
cases
demonstrates
such
purposeful
discrimination
that
the
careful
factual
findings
made
by
the
district
court
and
thoroughly
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
given
great
difference
and
that
the
at-large
election
system
cannot
be
sustained
in
the
circumstances
because
it
impairs
if
not
submerges
meaningful
access
to
the
political
process
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
starting
point
of
our
analysis
is
white
versus
regester
and
its
antecedents
whitcomb
versus
chavis.
our
reading
of
white
is
that
the
ultimate
inquiry
is
whether
black
citizens
of
mobile
city
and
county
had
been
excluded
from
meaningful
access
to
the
political
process
because
of
their
ways.
in
white
versus
regester
with
all
the
justices
joining
us
to
this
point,
the
court
reiterated
several
factors
alluded
to
in
whitcomb
and
in
judging
whether
the
at-large
scheme
at
issue
has
been
purposefully
operated
and
maintained.
it
is
our
view
reference
to
these
factors
set
forth
in
white
versus
regester
supplies
the
purpose
evidence
that
washington
versus
davis
requires.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
--
i
believe
it
to
be
a
substantial
number.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
don't
know
on
that.
the
factual
inquiry
suggested
in
white
against
regester
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
think
only
in
minority
have
what
would
be
comparable
to
mobile's
commission
system.
most
of
those
in
the
--
that
have
that
commission
system
were
legislative
and
executive
functions
are
combined
into
one
body,
most
of
those
are
elected
at-large
however
there
is
a
small
number
of
those
that
are
elected
from
districts
and
then
assigned
after
election
as
mobile's
former
practice
was
to
particular
executive
responsibilities.
and
the
first
criteria
then,
under
white
versus
regester
is
that
there
be
a
present
disparate
effect.
the
at-large
system
in
these
cases
has
produced
no
black
elected
officials
certainly
no
one
contains
that
this
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry
but
it
is
the
beginning.
the
exclusion
of
one-third
of
all
mobile
residents
from
representation
in
public
office
is
consistent
with
the
discriminatory
purpose.
the
second,
white
versus
regester
category
of
the
factual
inquiry
is
a
history
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
jurisdiction
of
such
a
nature
i
would
take
it
form
washington
v.
davis
that
it
suggest
purposeful
action.
this
record
documents
the
history
of
opposition
to
effective
black
exercise
of
the
franchise
that
is
both
long
and
strong
and
we've
set
out
as
much
as
we
could
in
our
brief
some
details
of
that
history.
the
highlights
include
that
right
up
until
the
time
of
trial;
a
single
mobile
state
senator
had
vetoed
consideration
of
single-member
districts
for
the
city.
another
highlight
is
that
the
state
legislature,
which
would
have
to
approve
any
changes
in
local
government
such
as
this
was
singularly
and
responsive.
in
1970
for
example
when
all
other
barriers
in
alabama
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
there
are
now.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
and
they
haven't
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
yes,
sir
but
i
believe
he
was
among
the
first
and
we're
talking
about
a
history
of
much
longer
than
mr.
gray's
incumbency.
mr.
james
p.
turner
our
appraisal
of
the
zimmer
case
would
run
something
like
this.
i'm
not
sure
that
everyone
one
of
those
factors
has
to
be
shown
in
a
delusion
case,
however
they
do,
and
zimmer
set
forth
the
kind
of
intense
scrutiny
that
you
have
to
undergo
in
delusion
case.
we
think
that
white
versus
regester
and
the
three
general
criteria
that
i'm
going
through
is
a
much
more
workable
and
useful
approach.
mr.
james
p.
turner
to
the
extent
that
it
is
inconsistent
and
i
think
that
it
is
in
places
with
the
white
versus
regester
criteria
that
i'm
going
through
it
would
not
in
my
judgment
be
good
law.
the
--
as
late
as
1970
in
the
alabama
legislature
after
all
barriers
to
block
voting
in
alabama
had
been
dealt
with
by
federal
court
orders,
there
was
one
that
remained
and
that
was
the
use
of
multi-member
districts
and
then
the
alabama
district
court
in
saints
versus
amos
finally
had
to
adopt
single-member
districts
for
the
alabama
legislature.
and
that's
about
the
time
that
mr.
gray
and
some
of
his
associates
became
representatives.
the
third,
white
versus
regester
criteria
is
the
unresponsiveness
of
the
elected
officials
to
minority
constituents.
the
question
here,
i
take
it
is
what
officials
do
after
election
and
not
what
they
promised
at
campaign
time.
again,
the
details
set
forth
in
our
brief
show
a
pervasive
lack
of
response
to
or
interest
in
issues
of
concern
to
black
mobilians.
no
matter
which
level
of
elected
officials
you
study,
there
is
apparent
evidence
of
unresponsiveness.
mr.
james
p.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
well,
i
can
certainly
agree
with
you
as
to
the
city
case
that
does
have
the
additional
element
of
the
executive
branch
election
and
one
would
have
to
make
that
translation
with
respect
to
the
school
board
case
and
i
realize
you
haven't
heard
argument
on
the
facts
yet.
but
you'll
see
there
that
it
is
pretty
much
a
garden
variety
case.
mr.
james
p.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
if
this
--
that
the
school
board
have
the
standard
power
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
that's
--
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
p.
turner
well,
i've
--
i
would
argue
not
mr.
chief
justice
the
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
the
commission
form
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
that's
correct
if
they
were
block
voting
on
the
basis
of
race.
but
again
here
there
is
a
legislative
element
to
these
positions.
local
government
is
historically
at
least
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
representative
government.
mr.
james
p.
turner
well,
that's
right
i
guess
we
could
divide
the
president
up
into
five
or
six
different
offices
if
we
follow
that
to
its
logical
extreme.
but
i
think
we
need
not
do
that
here,
we
conclude
in
short
that
all
of
the
factors
mentioned
in
white
versus
regester
had
been
satisfied
by
the
findings
below
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
we
urge
you
to
give
great
difference
to
them
and
turn
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
if
our
conclusion
is
right,
that's
the
at-large
system
is
mobile
has
given
white
voters
the
means
to
abolish
or
abridge
the
effective
black
electoral
participation
because
of
race,
it
necessarily
follows
that
violates
the
fifteenth
amendment.
but
a
second
part
of
our
submission
here
is
that
independently,
the
fifteenth
amendment
provides
a
basis
for
affirming
the
judgments
below.
now,
we
get
that
as
white
primary
cases,
we
say
that
in
the
terry
versus
adams,
the
jade
bird
club
was
a
discriminatory
private
organization
but
because
the
state
magnified
that
discrimination
and
made
it
meaningful
in
elections
that
this
court
turned
it
down
and
said
that
that
violated
the
fifteenth
amendment.
in
many
ways,
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
a
much
cleaner
and
more
direct
way
of
dealing
with
this
question.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
believe
the
terry
versus
adams
was
a
county
political
organization
that
endorsed
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
--
that
endorsed
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
my
recollection
is
that
they
endorsed
the
candidates
regularly
in
the
jade
bird
club,
which
was
an
all
white
club.
mr.
james
p.
turner
for
local
elections.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i'm
sure
if
you
say
it
was
mr.
justice
you
have
more
experience
than
i,
but
the
case
will
speak
to
itself.
mr.
james
p.
turner
no,
sir.
i
think
the
same
constitutional
principles
apply.
there
is
the
distinction
that
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
which
i
acknowledged
but
do
not
accept
this
having
constitutional
significance.
this
is
a
classical,
in
my
judgment
equity
case.
the
record
shows
and
i
urge
you
to
read
the
record
because
it's
very
revealing
that
in
all
forms
of
political
activity
in
mobile,
mobile
city,
mobile
county,
mobile
county
commission,
race
has
never
very
far
from
the
surface.
white
voters
the
majority
set
aside
under
this
record
all
other
considerations
when
race
is
injected
either
in
the
form
of
the
candidate
or
his
or
hers
supporters.
not
only
are
blacks
unable
to
win,
the
whites
they
support
yet
the
kiss
of
death
and
the
only
way
blacks
have
political
influence
is
to
bargain
it
away,
and
i
think
the
fifteenth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
them
more
than
that
kind
of
closet
courtship.
mr.
james
p.
turner
in
the
section
2
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act
in
terms
very
much
likely
fifteenth
amendment
prescribes
discrimination
and
voting
on
the
basis
of
race.
our
original
perception
was
that
while
certainly
section
2
would
be
violated
if
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
violated
that
you
don't
save
much
constitutional
energy
by
addressing
the
section
2.
appellees
will
argue
you
that
that's
incorrect
and
certainly,
if
they're
right,
you
certainly
will
take
a
careful
look
at
whether
section
2
is
broader
and
gives
more
remedies
than
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
james
p.
turner
it
was
mr.
justice
and
we
entered
an
objection
to
that
and
it
cannot
legally
at
this
time
be
implemented.
mr.
james
p.
turner
that's
right.
all
the
proposed
change
was
in
act
823
was
to
make
formal
the
practice
which
mr.
rhyne
has
described
to
you
and
the
other
counsel
spoke
about.
because
of
our
belief
and
our
determination
under
the
voting
rights
act
that
this
would
lock
in
the
commission
system
and
the
at-large
voting
that
went
with
it.
we
could
not
be
persuaded
that
the
burden
of
proof
had
been
carried
by
the
submitting
authority
who
entered
an
objection.
mr.
james
p.
turner
in
contemplation
of
law,
yes
mobile
does
not
have
specialized
commissioners
who
run
for
special
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
de
jure
offices.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
that
i
agree
with
the
answer
that
was
given
that
that
circumstances
is
so
likely
to
be
remote
or
so
unlikely
to
exist
that
it's
hard
to
frame
an
answer.
the
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
oh,
that
would
be
greatly
welcome.
mr.
james
p.
turner
it
-
it's
really
an
academic
question
mr.
chief
justice.
in
mobile,
the
district
court
found
according
from
a
defendant's
stud
--
that
one
in
the
universities,
that
mobile
was
so
residentially
segregated
that
they
couldn't
divide
it
into
three
districts
without
one
of
them
being
majority
black.
i
mean,
it's
that
kind
of
intensive
neighborhood
discrimination
that
we're
talking
about
and
that's
why
it's
so
awkward
for
me
to
try
to
answer
a
question
possibly
on
the
grounds
of
everything
is
salt
and
pepper.
it
--
it
isn't
in
this
case.
mr.
james
p.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
would
associate
myself
with
that
response.
thank
you.
mr.
james
p.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
well,
that
--
that's
a
question
on
which
the
court
has
thus
far
given
us
very
little
guidance.
certainly
the
--
the
purpose,
the
original
purpose
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
to
secure
the
franchise
for
newly
freed
black
citizens.
mr.
james
p.
turner
so
that's
clearly
covered.
it's
also
on
occasion
been
applied
in
other
circumstances
to
other
ethnic
minorities.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
would,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
think
they
would
be
covered
as
well,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
have
no
opinion
about
socialists,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
really
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
we
ought
to
approach
questions
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
we
do
in
other
areas
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
involving
blacks.
what
we
have
in
the
united
jewish
organization
was
a
case
involving
hasidic
jews
and
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
--
in
each
one
you're
going
to
be
able
to
make
a
--
an
assessment
of
the
factual
situation,
you're
going
to
be
able
to
compare
the
legislative
history
and
the
constitutional
history
and
make
a
coherent
judgment.
mr.
james
p.
turner
none
at
all.
mr.
james
p.
turner
because
i
think
that
one
of
the
touchstones
that
i
get
out
of
this
court's
opinions
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
that
it
is
--
is
directed
towards
the
protection
of
the
suffrage
rights
of
traditionally
discriminated
against
groups.
and
i
think
that
includes
hispanics,
includes
puerto
ricans,
it
may
in
cases
include
asian-americans.
mr.
james
p.
turner
surely,
as
the
--
as
the
court
at
least
the
majority
seemed
to
say
in
united
jewish
organization.
mr.
james
p.
turner
that
would
be
a
religious
group
and
i
know
of
no
basis
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
directly
to
cover
mormons
although
if
there
were
compelling
circumstances
and
they
were
a
discriminated
against
group,
it
strikes
me
that
the
court
might
well
entertain
the
argument
although
i
don't
know
how
it
would
come
out.
the
one
underlying
concern
that
i
think
many
people
have
about
this
case
is
its
scope.
there
are
lots
of
large
elections
in
this
country,
there
are
lots
of
different
minorities,
as
we
have
just
gone
through,
and
the
question
i
think
suggests
itself
of
whether
by
affirming
the
decisions
below,
the
court
would
be
taking
a
giant
step
towards
requiring
constitutional
reform
of
hundreds
of
cities.
now,
if
i
make
no
other
point
today,
i
want
to
argue
that
on
this
record
the
electoral
practices
in
mobile
are
in
a
special
category.
these
cases
do
not
present
the
normal
operation
of
your
regular
garden
variety
at-large
election
system
that
all
of
us
are
familiar
with
and
which
have
produced
competent
governments
across
the
land.
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
p.
turner
we
have
made
in
my
department
every
effort
to
enforce
the
fair
housing
act
which
so
far
we
have
regarded
as
a
freedom
of
choice
statute.
mr.
james
p.
turner
not
if
we
succeeded
but
these
measure
of
success
is
not
so
great
at
this
point
or
foreseeable
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
--
that
that
can
happen.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
--
i
think
that
as
long
as
you
have
a
situation
as
in
mobile,
where
at-large
systems
are
used
racially
to
dilute
minority
votes,
there
will
be
no
progress
away
from
block
voting.
and
when
minorities
are
able
to
elect
members
of
the
government,
our
experience
is
that
the
stigma
that
once
attached
to
race
quickly
dissolves.
birmingham
is
an
example
that
mr.
rhyne
mentioned.
tomorrow
a
black
councilman,
not
a
private
citizen
but
a
councilman
is
in
the
runoff
for
mayor.
while
there
is
no
record
of
the
facts
there
of
the
participation,
the
--
his
participation
in
local
government
certainly
was
of
assistance
in
getting
him
into
the
runoff.
so
i
think
that
at
this
stage
in
the
history,
where
there
are
ghettos
and
where
there
are
separate
residences,
and
the
--
and
the
record
here
shows
that
you
couldn't
divide
mobile
into
three
districts
without
one
of
them
being
majority
black,
it's
that
kind
of
housing
segregation
we're
talking
about.
and
no
effort
by
my
department
to
--
to
enforce
the
fair
housing
act
is
going
to
change
that
in
the
next
few
years.
the
--
so
this
--
mobile
it
seems
to
me
is
not
a
situation
like
marion
county,
indiana
in
the
chavis
case
where
blacks
just
got
on
the
wrong
side
in
elections
and
therefore
lost.
here,
the
blacks
have
formed
a
political
group,
the
non-partisan
voters
league
and
repeatedly
have
attempted
to
form
coalitions
with
like-minded
white
voters
but
has
been
repeatedly
unsuccessful.
my
time
is
very
short
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
couple
of
things
to
you.
and
mr.
rhyne
has
spoken
about
the
powers
of
the
league's
endorsement.
this
endorsement
is
made
on
a
pink
sample
ballot
and
it
is
true
that
many
candidates
seek
this
support
but
has
not
described
as
how
the
league
has
to
withhold
release
of
that
endorsement,
keep
it
secret
until
sometimes
within
hours
of
the
poll
operations.
a
state
senator
edington,
a
white
senator,
testified
that
he
has
20
years
experience
in
mobile
politics.
he
says
it
has
to
be
held
up
before
the
election
because
those
who
don't
get
the
endorsement
want
to
get
copies
and
spread
them
out
to
other
areas
in
mobile
county
to
use
against
the
candidates
that
were
endorsed.
the
result
is
that
black
supported
candidates
frequently
get
into
the
runoff
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
no.
but
what
we're
--
what
we're
trying
to
find
out,
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
mobile
is
a
situation
like
marion
county,
indiana,
where
blacks
were
democrats
and
they
lost
elections
and
they
came
to
this
court
complaining
that
they
lost
more
elections
than
they
should
and
they
didn't
have
enough
representation.
and
the
court
said,
“that's
tough
because
you've
made
political
choices
and
you
had
a
fair
chance.”
now,
if
mobile
was
like
that,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
but
the
two
courts
below
have
said
it
isn't
like
that
and
i
am
trying
to
point
out
the
basis
for
their
reasoning.
and
so
that
when
you
get
to
the
runoff
election
and
there's
a
black
supported
candidate
whose
pink
endorsement
has
been
made
known
now,
there's
no
way
to
hide
it
any
longer
and
that
is
where
you
get
what
one
expert
called
the
"kiss
of
death."
the
record
has
several
examples.
let
me
just
give
you
one.
if
you
turn
to
page
593
in
volume
ii
of
the
appendix
in
the
mobile
case,
that's
no.
77-1844,
the
numbers
are
at
the
bottom
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
593,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
turner
volume
ii.
mr.
james
p.
turner
the
numbers
are
at
the
bottom.
mr.
james
p.
turner
the
numbers
are
at
the
bottom,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
turner
there
was
a
mobile
person,
mrs.
gerre
koffler,
a
white
resident,
who
decided
to
run
for
the
school
board
in
1972
because
she
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
some
way
we
could
make
the
april
supreme
court
decision
work
in
mobile,
that's
your
decision
in
davis.
she
obtained
the
league's
endorsement.
she
got
into
the
runoff
and
if
you
look
at
page
593
you
will
see
the
kind
of
ad
that
came
out
after
the
endorsement
was
made
public.
it
shows
a
picture
of
a
--
of
a
black
leader,
john
leflore,
it
shows
the
white
candidate,
it
alleges
such
scurrilous
things
that
she
has
entertained
blacks
in
her
home,
she
has
been
seen
and
photographed
in
company
of
blacks,
but
it
also
shows
the
exact
vote
she
got
in
each
black
ward
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
am
unaware
of
that,
your
honor.
i'm
sure
local
counsel
would
be
able
to
enlighten.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i'm
not
sure
whether
they're
a
majority
or
a
minority.
i
believe
by
most
accounts
they
are
a
slight
preponderance.
mr.
james
p.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
turner
no.
mr.
james
p.
turner
not
--
not
in
my
experience,
no
sir.
if
you
turn
to
page
595,
you'll
see
a
similar
ad
run
in
the
same
runoff
election
against
another
white
candidate
whose
black
support
had
been
revealed
by
the
primary
election,
and
it
is
the
same
story.
the
--
the
"kiss
of
death"
is
right
there.
so
it's
not
just
this
kind
of
racial
voting,
there
is
more
in
this
record.
there's
other
aspects
in
mobile
that
are
unique,
is
the
at-large
elected
--
in
one
at-large
legislative
election,
white
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
--
democrats
and
republicans
agreed
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
well,
it's
a
--
it's
a
very
troublesome
thing
and
i
think
it
may
depend
on
which
amendment
you
want
to
talk
about.
intent
is
very
nebulous
especially
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
james
p.
turner
okay.
i
understand
that
as
in
norwood
versus
harrison,
where
mississippi
since
1940
had
maintained
a
textbook
program
and
then
when
desegregation
of
schools
came
that
program
mushroomed
to
provide
books
to
the
private
schools.
it
was
the
evolution,
the
changing
circumstances
that
eroded
what
had
been
a
perfectly
proper
state
purpose
into
an
illegitimate
unconstitutional
one
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
so
if
you're
talking
about
that
kind
of
--
of
change,
that
kind
of
evolutionary
change
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
--
it
is
very
hard
to
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
right.
mr.
james
p.
turner
well,
it's
the
same
thing
in
--
in
norwood,
i
submit.
but
here,
if
you
go
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
say
you
look
at
the
legislative
intent.
mr.
james
p.
turner
the
state
legislature.
mr.
james
p.
turner
no.
now,
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
if
you
have
--
if
you
go
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
cases,
your
honor.
we
have
outlined
in
the
brief
how
this
court's
precedents,
especially
terry
versus
adams,
have
held
that
by
a
state
adopting
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
--
private
purposeful
discrimination
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
i'm
not
sure,
certainly
not
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
because
it
is
our
submission
that
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
what
the
--
that
there
certainly
state
involvement
in
running
elections
and
in
running
at-large
elections
in
mobile,
and
there
certainly
is
private
discrimination,
just
like
there
was
in
the
jaybird
club.
and
by
the
state
magnifying
and
making
use
and
making
effective
that
private
discrimination,
it's
the
same
principle
as
terry
versus
adams
that
would
apply.
so
you
use
private
discrimination
that's
implemented
by
state
procedures.
mr.
james
p.
turner
thank
you.
