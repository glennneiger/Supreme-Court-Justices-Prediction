justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rhyne,
how
could
you
know
whether
a
particular
individual
black
or
white
is
“qualified”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
i
might
be
anecdotal
too,
i
grew
up
in
milwaukee,
we
have
a
city
council
of
23
members,
and
12
of
them
were
tavern
keepers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
say
that
given
the
fact
of
polarization
as
it's
been
referred
to
generally
in
the
case,
it
does
not
require
a
finding
of
intent
in
the
structuring
of
the
governmental
unit
to
discriminate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
before
you
get
to
the
question
of
remedy
let's
talk
about
the
constitutional
violation.
do
--
you
said
that
it
does
not
have
to
be
by
intent,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
supposing
that
instead
--
mobile
and
instead
of
being
roughly
65-35
was
85-15
and
they
had
head
a
longstanding
three
commissioners
at-large
system
and
could
the
district
court
then
tell
them
they
had
to
go
from
three
commissioners
to
five
commissioners
because
even
three
commissioners
split
up
geographically
would
not
enable
the
negro
population
to
have
a
representative
on
the
council?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
have
that
finding
by
the
district
court,
look
at
page
32
(b)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
i
thought
that
judge
pittman
came
right
after
the
hurdle
and
then
kind
of
backed
off
saying
that
washington
against
davis
had
not
change
the
delusion
cases
and
it
was
and
no
intent
does
require
there
so
it
didn't
find
it?
see
the
top
of
page
32
(b)
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
turner
does
the
government
think
that
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
and
zimmer
against
mckeithen
remains
a
good
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
workableness
and
usefulness
aren't
usually
thought
of
as
being
necessarily
constitutional
factors.
if
you
say
something
as
more
workable
and
more
useful,
does
that
mean
you
don't
think
zimmer
is
any
longer
good
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
allen,
i
have
joined
opinions
which
refer
to
the
term
slating
and
i
must
confess
i
am
not
entirely
sure
what
it
means.
could
you
give
me
your
understanding
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
concluded
that
the
trial
court
did
not
find
that
there
was
an
intent
to
discriminate,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
there
was
an
intent
to
discriminate?
now
is
that
a
two-court
finding
that
we
ought
to
affirm?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
a
problem
here
in
what
standards
are
applied,
isn't
it
because
washington
against
davis
came
down
after
this
litigation
had
started
and
as
i
understand
that
the
nevett
brought
force
or
whatever
was,
was
decided
that
intermediate
stage
of
this
litigation
so
that
you
have
a
little
bit
of
a
shifting
of
legal
standards?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
litigation
was
eight
or
nine
years
old.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
opponent
cites
that
senator
dirksen
statement
that
sentence
in
section
2
is
just
a
restatement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
attorney
general
katzenbach
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
passes
laws?
the
attorney
general
or
the
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
blacksher,
forgive
me
if
i've
interrupted
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question.
i
wasn't
sure
whether
you
were
finished
or
not.
if
--
if
you're
right
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
here
because
blacks
are
not
being
permitted
to
have
their
impact
felt
in
the
electoral
--
in
the
electoral
process,
how
far
out
can
that
process
be
--
line
of
reasoning
be
extended
under
your
theory?
how
many
other
groups
can
claim
that
they
were
discriminated
against
by
the
state
legislature
because
the
state
legislature
just
didn't
happen
to
like
that
particular
group?
i
mean
catholics,
jews?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
it
derive
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
--
what
result
do
you
get
in
reliance
on
the
amendments
you've
recited
to
justice
stewart
and
the
statutes
in
respect
to
--
my
question
is
to
who,
other
than
blacks
can
make
this
same
claim
that
although
they're
allowed
to
vote
there
are
--
they
are
--
their
representation
is
diluted
because
of
the
way
of
the
district
--
the
districting
goes,
even
though
one
man,
one
vote
is
complied
with?
i
take
it
from
your
referral
to
yick
wo
that
asian
americans
could
rely
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
--
where
--
and
that's
a
statutory
showing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
constitutional
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
would
it
--
would
it,
mr.
turner,
include
any
national
group
that
was
the
subject
of
--
their
object
of
determination
of
discrimination
rather?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
--
you
had
no
trouble
saying
that
hispanic
americans
would
--
would
be
included.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
--
what
leads
you
to
be
able
to
answer
that
question
so
easily
and
yet
shy
away
from
any
expansion
into
other
national
origin
areas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
allen,
to
--
taking
that
page
of
the
appendix
to
which
you're
addressing,
the
last
sentence
in
the
paragraph
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
court
says
there
is
a
"current"
condition
of
dilution
of
the
black
vote
resulting
from
intentional
state
legislative
inaction
which
is
as
effectual
as
the
intentional
state
action
referred
to
in
keyes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
you
at
least
concede
that
that
is
a
finding
of
intentional
state
legislative
inaction?
not
--
you
may
feel
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
--
as
intentional
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
--
is
your
act
--
is
your
response
to
justice
white's
question
predicated
in
--
in
any
way
on
an
assumption
that
there
is
or
is
not
a
private
cause
of
action
under
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you
--
your
first
option
which
you
say
you
prefer
is
going
to
lead
to
some
undesirable
practices,
too,
on
the
part
of
people
who've
lost
on
a
constitutional
question
in
a
lower
court
because
they
can
just
look
through
the
statute
books
and
if
they
can
find
a
statute
that
they
say,
“gee,
the
others
i
might
have
won
on
this
statute”,
therefore
it
was
unnecessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
question,
they'll
have
a
built-in
argument
for
at
least
to
a
remand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
don't
have
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
notice
pleading
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
you
don't
have
to
state
the
statute
you
rely
on,
all
you
have
to
do
is
plead
alleged
facts
sufficient
to
support
a
claim
for
relief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
in
arlington
heights
the
defendants
there
had
said
we
--
we
simply
are
--
want
a
decision
on
the
constitutional
question,
we're
willing
to
assume
the
complaint
states
a
claim
for
relief
under
the
federal
statute
and
all
we
want
to
litigate
is
a
constitutional
question,
what
should
the
district
court
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
should
the
district
--
what
should
the
district
court
have
done
in
deciding
the
thing
in
the
first
instance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
it
--
it
could
not
then
go
to
the
constitutional
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
--
what
if
the
defendant
say,
“let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
we
don't
concede
but
we
--
we
think
the
most
important
thing
here
is
the
constitutional
question”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
but
there
are
--
i
think
there's
a
--
a
lot
of
district
judges
that
don't.
