mr.
rhyne,
before
you
--
before
you
conclude,
in
your
--
earlier
in
your
argument
you
suggested
that
the
people
whose
intent
would
be
most
relevant
would
be
the
intent
of
the
three
commissioners,
the
defendants.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
do
you
read
the
district
court
findings
and
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
whose
intent
do
you
think
those
courts
were
talking
about?
the
opinions
are
a
little
bit
unclear
to
me.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
think
it's
definitely
the
intent
of
the
legislature?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
some
of
the
material
under
the
zimmer
factors
wouldn't
really
bear
on
the
intent
of
the
legislators
very
much
and
they
seem
to
rely
on
those
factors.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
it
ever
include
whites?

the

justice

oh.
justice
harry

blackmun
mr.
turner
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
always
puzzles
me
in
these
cases.
the
--
i
don't
know
whether
these
are
--
who
sponsored
these
ads
but
no
doubt
a
--
a
group
of
people
who
were
against
having
blacks
be
elected
to
public
office.
whose
intent
is
really
most
important
here?
i
suppose
you
can
always
find
in
a
community
some
very
strong
anti-black
sentiment,
maybe
in
the
legislature,
maybe
in
the
city
council.
what
--
what
group
of
people
if
any
should
we
focus
on
in
the
intent
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
--
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
understand
it
to
mean
or
what
do
you
understand
the
court
below
to
have
held
on
the
intent
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice

--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
here,
we're
talking
about
a
refusal
to
make
a
change.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
in
that
--
this
kind
of
case,
whose
intent
should
we
look
at?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
state
legislature?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
each
of
these
pamphlets
here
are
not
relevant
on
that
intent
issue.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
it
have
any
relevance
at
all
to
the
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
put
the
question
this
way.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
put
the
question
this
way.
if
it's
the
legislative
intent
that's
controlling,
supposing
everybody
in
mobile
wanted
to
have
blacks
fairly
represented
and
was
giving
them
excellent
services
and
were
promptly
prosecuting
people
who
burned
crosses
and
everything
was
going
along
fine.
but
you
had
the
majority
of
the
state
legislature
who've
said,
“we
don't
want
any
blacks
in
the
government
in
mobile.”
would
it
be
the
same
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
if
there's
block
voting
on
the
school
board
or
on
the
county
election,
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
there'd
be
block
voting
on
the
--
justice
harry
a.

--
on
the
other
kinds
of
(voice

--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
not
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there's
some
overlap,
isn't
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
challenge
the
district
court
finding
that
there
was
racial
block
voting
in
this
--
within
the
jurisdiction
we're
talking
about?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
whoever
put
out
these
pamphlets
apparently
thought
it
was.
