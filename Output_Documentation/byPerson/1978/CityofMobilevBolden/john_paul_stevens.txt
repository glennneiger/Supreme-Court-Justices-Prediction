justice
john
paul
stevens
the
difficulty
that
--
in
this
case
though,
i
know
you're
talking
about
the
rest
of
the
country,
but
this
case,
the
district
courts
finding
are
as
i
remember
them,
that
the
color
of
the
man's
skin
is
of
critical
importance
in
the
election.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
we
have
to
look
at
mobile
rather
than
oakland
and
cleveland
and
other
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
we
accept
those
findings
or
do
we
not
for
purposes
of
our
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rhyne,
do
we
--
do
we
accept
those
findings
for
purposes
of
our
decision
or
do
we
â€“
do
you
ask
us
to
reexamine
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
critical
to
your
case
if
we
reexamine
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
mr.
rhyne
did
not
the
district
court
find
that
the
blacks
were
not
getting
the
same
services
from
their
government
but
the
whites
were.
isn't'
that
the
district
court's
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
but
i
am
not
saying
you
necessarily
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
we
have
to
deal
with
the
findings
of
the
district
court
rather
than
the
changing
conditions
that
you
described
they
are
taking
place
today
or
do
we,
normally
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
we
deal
with
the
findings
the
district
court
made.
we
got
to
live
with
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
the
gomillion
case
would
have
decided
differently
if
there
have
been
showing
that
there
is
no
impediment
to
the
voting
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
this
--
suppose
this
was
out
and
out
in
a
sense
that
the
legislature
and
the
commissioner
said
the
reason
we
want
to
maintain
our
plan,
our
commission
form
a
government,
is
because
we
do
not
want
blacks
to
be
in
the
--
elected
as
commissioner,
would
it
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
blacksher,
supposing
in
chicago,
the
city
council
decided
they
didn't
want
anymore
republicans
and
they
passed
an
at-large
system
there
which
would
effectively
exclude
the
republicans
from
the
city
council.
i
suppose
the
republicans
or
group
are
entitled
to
equal
protection,
under
your
theory
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
significant
thing
about
them
i
suppose
is
they
vote
as
blocks.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
that's
because
we
don't
want
these
members
of
this
black
in
our
legislature,
does
that
make
it
invidious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
are
you
saying
that
a
political
party
that
frankly,
a
political
party
like
the
republicans
are
not
entitled
to
the
--
or
they
can
be
subjected
to
discrimination
simply
because
they
are
republicans?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
this
case
be
different
if
all
the
black
citizens
in
mobile
organize
a
political
party
to
have
the
black
political
action
group
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schnapper,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
--
your
point
in
mr.
allen
is
said
that
when
you
really
analyze
the
facts,
the
case
boils
down
to
as
block
voting
plus
at-large
and
at-large
system
plus
the
minority
of
blacks
in
the
voting
population
and
in
your
brief,
you
emphasize
those
very
facts
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
as
distinguish
other
cases,
do
you
think
those
facts
were
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
blacksher,
before
you
get
to
remedy,
whose
intent
are
we
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
blacksher,
if
we
just
for
the
moment
confine
ourselves
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
again,
i
understand
your
separate
argument
on
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
fifteenth
amendment.
i'd
like
to
pursue
the
thought
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
suggested
earlier
about
--
you
would
say
the
same
theory
would
apply
to
catholics,
a
--
or
religious
or
an
ethnic
group
as
well
as
to
blacks.
what
about
a
political
group
such
as
republicans?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allen,
let's
proceed
one
step
further
beside
--
beyond
the
assumptions
mr.
justice
white
made.
assume
the
record
does
demonstrate
there's
an
appropriate
finding
of
a
present
intent
to
maintain
the
system
in
order
to
prevent
black
participation
in
the
school
board.
would
that
constitute
a
constitutional
violation
when
the
original
rule
was
lawful
when
adopted?what
is
your
view
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
throw
another
question
at
you
at
the
same
time
while
you're
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
intent
was
an
essential
part
of
the
holding
in
white
against
regester?
do
you
think
the
court
relied
there
on
impact
or
--
