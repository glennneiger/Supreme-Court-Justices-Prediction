justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
want
to
suggest
to
you
that
the
commission
form
of
government
as
you
described
in
mobile
is
certainly
very
different
from
the
commission
of
form
of
government
as
we
knew
it
in
new
jersey
when
my
father
was
for
13
years
a
member
of
the
city
commission
of
new
york.
and
there
you
had
as
many
as
80
candidates
and
the
first
five
were
elected
and
then
the
five
of
them
by
majority
vote
decided
which
should
be
director
of
public
safety,
which
should
be
director
of
public
affairs
and
so
forth.
and
one
did
not
run
because
he
was
supposed
to
be
an
expert
in
any
particular
field.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
am
not.
i
am
speaking
of
the
city
of
new
york.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
the
commission
form
of
government
in
new
jersey
for
some
25
years
and
most
of
the
major
cities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
takes
to
be
back
to
my
government.
the
rightful
welcome
is
the
mayor
who
made
the
assignment
of
the
places.
so
there
are
as
you
pointed
out
all
variations
but
i
join
mr.
justice
white
in
asking
whether
your
case
would
be
the
same
without
a
please
contest
standing
for
a
place.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
allen,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
this.
as
i
understand
that
your
point,
there
is
no
slate
making
committee
within
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
what
you're
saying
is
that
anytime
a
democrat
is
a
candidate
for
the
nomination
of
this
party,
he's
just
decided
to
run
himself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
is
this
an
unusual
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
allen,
i
suppose
your
answer
to
a
question
mr.
justice
black
asked
in
the
other
case
might
be
somewhat
different
in
the
one
that
was
given.
i
think
you've
taken
--
you
take
that
there
is
a
difference
between
this
case
and
the
other
case,
or
maybe
you
don't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
ask
you.
do
you
think
there
are
differences?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
have
any
significance
on
the
outcome?
if
we
dedide
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
one
way,
do
you
think
they
both
should
go
the
same
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
if
there
is
evidence
to
support
the
finding
that
there
was
a
deliberate
maintenance
of
the
at-large
system
in
the
other
case,
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
absence
of
such
evidence
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
they
were
not
adopted
in
that
sort
of
thing
but
there
was
not
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
other
words,
if
this
finding
were
supported
by
evidence
would
that
make
your
legal
position
any
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
a
hard
case,
suppose
somebody
said
let's
have
--
change
the
system
so
that
there
would
be
some
kind
of
a
proportional
representation
and
everybody
is,
well
not
do
that
then
you
might
get
some
blacks
on
the
school
board,
would
the
case
be
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
arguably
the
other
cases
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
arguably,
the
other
cases
are
more
like
that
than
this.
