mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
the
case
that
i
present
to
you
is
whether
mobile's
election
system,
under
which
it
elects
its
commissioners
in
at-large
election
is
constitutional.
now
mobile
is
a
city
of
a
190,000
people.
one-third
of
them
are
black.
there
has
never
been
a
black
commissioner
elected
and
i
think
that
the
ultimate
issue
that
is
presented
to
this
court
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
these
blacks
who
are
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
deprived
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
are
they
deprived
of
equal
access
and
equal
participation
in
the
election
system
on
mobile
as
they
alleged
in
their
complaint?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
they
do.
that's
really
the
big
distinction
between
a
commission
form
of
government
and
say
the
merit
council.
each
commissioner
is
elected
as
the
finance
commissioner,
or
the
safety
commissioner,
or
the
public
works
commissioner.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
it
did.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
believe
that
as
a
matter
fact
the
specialization
in
so
far
as
prescribed
by
the
law
was
laid
out
in
1965.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
it
has
always
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
anyone
who
run
for
the
commission.
say,
i'm
running
for
the
finance
post
because
i'm
an
expert
in
finance.
i
am
running
for
the
police
or
safety
post
because
i
am
an
expert
in
police
or
i
am
running
for
the
public
works
department
because
i
am
an
expert
in
them.
i
guess
a
big
difference
between
the
commission
form
which
is
more
like
the
city
manage
of
form
than
any
other
class.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
is.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
true.
they
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
all
of
the
powers.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
it's
right.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
right.
and
i
was
saying
that
when
they
do
the
administrative
executive
work
then
will
exceed
the
managers
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
also
enact
the
ordinances,
but
the
people
know
which
of
the
three
are
responsible
for
each
of
the
functions
of
the
city
and
as
of
necessity
this
form
of
government
which
began
around
the
turn
of
the
century
was
elected
to
wipe
out
the
corruption
mayor
alderman
form
that
was
causing
a
lot
of
problems
at
that
time
and
it
gives
each
commissioner
absolute
responsibility
to
each
voter,
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
i
think
one
of
really
great
things
about
the
field
of
the
municipal
government,
and
i've
been
in
since
1937
as
every
city's
different
when
you
come
right
down
to
it.
you
can't
say
that
one
city
is
precisely
like
another,
i
don't
care
how
you
go
about
it
and
how
you
describe
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
it
is
and
they
have
to
adopt
the
policies
and
then
carry
them
out,
but
i
think
the
major
thing
is
that
the
people
know
when
they
vote
for
them
that
they're
voting
for
this
man
but
of
course
he
is
an
expert
in
finance
and
this
man
is
an
expert
in
police
safety
and
this
man
of
because
he
is
an
expert
in
public
works,
and
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
run
as
such
as
they
did
not
prior
to
1965,
it
was
always
understood
that
this
man
was
running
for
this
post
and
that
man
was
running
for
that
post.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
right,
it
is
non-partisan
election.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
four
years.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
they
are.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
no,
there
is
no
primary,
it's
a
non-partisan
election
and
there
are
no
impediments
to
anybody
registering,
anybody
qualifying
to
be
a
candidate
for
anyone
of
the
places
even
thought
they
are
not
an
expert
in
finance
or
an
expert
in
one
of
the
others
and
there
is
no
question
of
what.
there
is
equal
participation
in
the
electoral
process
and
that
the
votes
are
counted
equally.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
now
negroes
have
run,
three
negroes
run
in
1973.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
say
in
this
how
they
stood
for
election
and
you're
right.
they
stood
for
election
in
1973.
but
as
the
district
court
pointed
out
they
were
young,
inexperienced
and
run
rather
limited
campaigns
and
even
care
of
the
black
awards.
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
none
whatever.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
there
was
a
manner
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now
mr.
arendall
is
here,
he
is
a
great
expert
trying
to
make
an
expert
on
me
but
i'm
saying
there
isn't
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
absolutely
not.
so
anybody
can
run.
now,
this
is
the
first
case
that
i
know
of
the
handed
for
this
court
that
really
is
quarreling
in
laws
at-large
elections
in
the
municipal
level.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
pretty
hard
question,
but
i
would
say
that
my
case
would
not
be
different
because
in
every
commission
form
of
government
that
i
know
of,
the
people
always
know
who
that
commissioner
is
running
for
and
who
they
are
voting
for
and
then
you
have
some
larger
experience
and
since
now
they
were
proportional
representation
on
voting
in
such.
but
i
say
coming
back
to
my
point
that
this
is
the
first
case
before
this
court
involving
at-large
election,
we
have
67%
of
the
cities
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
but
you
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
agree
except
i
think
here
you
have
a
special
reason,
because
the
people
can
better
hold
these
commissioners
responsible
for
their
actions
because
they
know
who
takes
the
actions.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
commission
form
of
the
government,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
right
and
you
have
a
city
manager,
you
have
a
mayor
who
runs
the
overall.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now,
you're
speaking
of
a
county,
are
you
not?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
have
the
commission
form,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
that
on
reconsideration
i
would
stay
with
this
thing.
i
think
that
the
election
at-large
is
the
important
thing
here
and
it
is
true
though
that
there
is
a
tremendous
battle
about
the
qualifications
of
the
various
commissioners
because
i
too
mr.
justice
brennan
grew
up
and
my
father
run
in,
that's
too
long
ago
i
don't
remember
how
many
candidate
but
this
was
county
and
not
city
in
selecting
this
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
right.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
from
the
usual
merit
council
form
of
government
that
is
very
clear.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
right
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
the
judges
are
laymen
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
in
missouri
where
our
present
chairman
was.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
a
judge
is
the
layman
in
illinois,
but
let
me
get
back
to
this
fact.
one
of
the
most
interesting
thing
to
me
is
that
these
plaintiffs
have
brought
this
suit,
they
have
35%
black
but
never
has
a
qualified
black,
run
for
office
in
mobile.
now
if
there's
any
one
thing
that
this
court
can
judicially
notice
and
then
mr.
justice
marshall
knows
better
than
anybody
else
that
it's
this,
when
i
first
start
representing
cities
in
1937,
there
wasn't
a
single
black
that
i
know
of
on
any
city
council
and
certainly
no
black
mayor.
today,
we
have
a
tremendous
number.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
he
has
state
his
qualifications
and
the
people
vote
for
him
on
the
basis
of
his
qualifications.
it
puts
forth
these
qualifications
in
the
race.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
the
city
council
of
milwaukee
doesn't
really
run
the
city,
the
mayor,
there
was
mayor
home
probably
then
and
a
city
manager,
generally
run
the
city.
but
the
thing
is
that,
here
you've
got
mayor
bradley
running
out
in
los
angeles
in
a
city
that's
17%
black.
he
run
once,
he
was
defeated.
he
run
the
next
time,
he's
been
elected
and
then
elected
over
and
over
again.
and
i
see
around
this
nation
and
we
cite
them
on
page
of
11
and
12
of
our
brief
with
many
illustrations
raleigh,
north
carolina,
22%
black,
black
mayor.
got
a
black
mayor
of
atlanta,
black
mayor
in
new
orleans,
black
mayor
of
newark,
black
mayor
of
oakland,
i
could
name
a
hundred
of
them
almost
because
i
worked
with
them
almost
daily
and
i
am
saying
that
we've
reached
the
point
in
our
nation
where
the
color
of
a
man's
skin
in
the
political
area
doesn't
count
as
much
is
his
ability
to
prove
that
he
can
do
the
job.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
did
not
hear
the
question.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now,
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
you
probably
knew
john
leflore
very
well.
he
is
one
of
the
ablest
americans,
who
have
live,
but
i'm
sorry,
he
was
plaintiff,
he
is
dead.
now,
i
would
be
awfully
hard
to
convince
that
if
john
leflore
run
with
35%
black
that
he
wouldn't
get
enough
quite
votes
to
win
and
my
statement
to
you
is
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
pardon?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
he
was
brilliant
man.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
but
he
is
a
politician
and
you
know
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
he
organized
the
only
misleading
organization
that
existed
in
mobile
the
non-partisan
voters
league
which
is
back.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
it's
very
relevant
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
shows
the
sophistication
of
the
voters
today
and
i
think
it
also
shows
that
the
voters
are
looking
at
the
qualifications
of
the
candidates
rather
than
the
color
of
their
skin
or
they
would
have
gotten
35%
of
the
votes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
read
“the
kiss
of
death”
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
read
what
the
judge
said
about
polarization.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
say
that
the
findings
are
based
on
my
minefield
evidence
because
the
expert
testified
that
polarization
was
lessening
all
the
time
and
there
were
witnesses
who
testified
that
a
black
man
would
have
a
reason
an
opportunity
to
win.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
ask
you
to
reexamine
them
because
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
not
particularly
i
think
that
which
you
have
here
is
a
legal
conclusion
rather
than
a
fact
because
what
did
the
court
do?
in
a
voting
rights
case
you've
got
to
find
some
barrier,
some
obstacle.
now
in
mobile,
you
have
full
access,
full
participation
by
blacks.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
say
to
that,
that
the
evidence
is
at
polarization
is
growing
less
and
less
all
the
time
and
that
this
court
must
pay
some
attention
to
the
fact
that
blacks
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
don't
follow
its
activities
quite
as
close
i
am
afraid.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
ku
klux
klan
as
far
as
i
know
of
it
is
fading
as
a
factor
in
the
south
just
as
polarization
of
the
black
vote
is
fading.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
my
position
is
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
right.
i
think
as
long
as
they
have
equal
access
and
equal
participation
and
their
votes
are
counted
equally,
that's
all
the
constitution
requires
and
they
have
that
in
mobile.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now,
they
are
equal.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
right
because
testimony
is
this,
that
the
black
vote
is
decisive.
all
the
candidates
for
commissioner
campaign
very
hard
for
the
black
vote
and
on
pages
141,
142,
143
you
have
reverend
hope
saying
that
he
feels,
he's
head
of
the
non-partisan
voters
league.
he
feels
that
the
three
white
candidates
or
three
white
commissioners
who
now
are
those
officers
treat
the
blacks
very
well
and
we
have
over
and
over
again
the
fact
that
these
commissioners
have
the
open
door
policy,
they
see
the
blacks,
they
try
to
care
of
their
problem,
sure
they
can
take
care
of
them
all,
all
cities
have
problems
but
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
the
finding
on
services,
there
are
other
remedies
for
that
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
doesn't
have
to
do
with
voting.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
don't
think
you
can
decide
this
case
in
a
vacuum,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
entirety
of
the
picture
which
going
on
in
the
world
today.
i
think
that
in
this
instance
where
there's
no
impediment
in
the
voting
process,
whatever.
everybody
can
register,
every
can
run
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
the
gomillion
case
is
entirely
different
from
this.
the
gomillion
case
was
an
out-and-out
discriminatory
action
and
you
got
those
discriminations
here.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
could
be
but
you
don't
have
that
here.
you
don't
have
any
intentional
discrimination.
you
have
absolutely
quality
of
voters
to
the
voting
process.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
white
there's
no
such
finding
what
they
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
even
on
that
as
i
say
that
the
testimony
was
by
the
expert
boyles
that
polarization
is
lessening
in
the
government
in
each
brief
concedes
that
race
was
not
an
issue
in
the
1973
election
but
it
was
the
last
election.
now,
what
the
court
did,
the
district
court
did
was
it
couldn't
find
an
obstacle.
it
couldn't
find
an
impediment
and
found
that
everybody
have
an
unfettered
right
to
vote.
so
what
it
did
was
and
i
quote
the
court,
“the
court
concludes
that
an
at-large
system
is
an
effective
barrier
to
blacks
seeking
public
life.
well,
that
simply
isn't
true,
it
simply
is
not
true.”
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
absolutely,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
want
to
step
further
and
said
that,
that
existing
so
that
so-called
barrier
to
blacks
seeking
public
life
establishes
the
element
of
intent.
now,
i
think
that
this
case
is
enormously
important
because
having
found
that
the
system
itself
was
the
barrier
all
the
court
could
do
was
to
polish
it
and
what
did
they
do,
they
wrote
an
entire
new
city
chart
with
a
mayor
and
non-city
councilman
because
they
said
that
the
only
way
and
i
quote
this
court
again,
“you
can
provide
blacks
with
the
realistic
opportunity
to
elect
blacks
to
the
city
governing
body
is
to
wipe
out
the
existing
government
and
put
in
a
mayor-council
plan
was
single
member
district.
i
don't
think
these
courts
in
the
business
of
fixing
elections
or
guaranteeing
that
a
person
is
going
to
be
able
to
vote
and
put
in
office
a
man
of
his
own
color.
they
have
an
equally
right
to
an
equal
shot
one
man
one
vote.”
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
i
think
the
vicious
part,
you
are
right.
the
vicious
part
of
this
decision
is
that
it
more
or
less
freezes
segregation.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
if
you're
going
to
chop
up
mobile
into
non-single
member
districts
and
the
black
start
moving
out
of
the
district,
they
lose
control
of
it.
so
i
think
that's
really
to
me,
we've
reach
the
point
i
say
when
color
should
not
count
and
it
has
not
counted
throughout
the
nation
and
i
think
this
court
should
say
so
that
you're
not
going
to
provide
proportional
representation
by
race,
you
never
had
and
the
city
and
that
state
would
say
no,
it
would
vote
yes,
equal
access
yes,
equal
participation
yes,
but
not
proportional
representation
by
race.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes
and
it
didn't
work
very
either
place.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
alright,
but
(inaudible)
he
put
it
in
and
since
that
they
told
me
i
wasn't
working
really
good
and
so
you
got
rid
of
it
but
i
am
saying
that
proportional
representation
by
race
is
not
guaranteed
with
the
country.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
didn't
quite
understand
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
i
wasn't
sure
that
i
had
any
minutes
left
but
let
me
answer
one
question
for
mr.
justice
stewart.
according
to
the
municipal
year
book
and
i
guess
it's
fairly
accurate
67%
of
all
the
cities
are
--
have
elections
apart.
now,
the
government
here
and
its
brief,
says
the
measure
of
the
effect
of
an
electoral
system
is
not
proportional
representation
but
fair
representation
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
as
they
review
the
record
in
this
case,
they're
going
to
find
that
blacks
have
been
fairly
represented
in
mobile.
we
quote
on
pages
10,
and
i
guess
9
and
20,
reverend
hope
who
had
some
non-partisan
voters
league
and
he
says
that
the
current
commissioners
fairly
represent
the
blacks
in
mobile.
and
for
16
years,
there
was
a
commissioner,
mr.
langan
who
was
noted
for
the
fact
that
he
represented
the
blacks.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
blacks
were
indeed
their
support
the
kiss
of
death.
he
was
there
an
awful
long
time.
now
in
conclusion,
i
believe
very
strongly
in
the
right
to
vote,
on
an
equal
vote
and
i
believe
that
that's
what
mobile
provides
here.
it
provides
equal
access
to
the
voting
system,
equal
participation
in
that
system
and
an
equal
count
of
those
votes.
i
think
that's
all
the
constitution
requires
and
polarization
is
the
only
thing
that
they've
offered
here
to
prove
invidious
discrimination,
and
i
don't
think
that's
enough.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
question
of
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
the
abolition
of
the
mobile
commission
form
of
government
elected
at
large.
this
is
the
first
case
involving
a
state
or
a
local
government
where
the
entire
form
of
government,
not
just
the
manner
of
its
election,
has
been
held
unconstitutional.
mobile
is
one-third
black.
the
district
court
held
that
only
the
abolition
of
the
commission
form
of
government
in
its
entirety
could
"provide
blacks
a
realistic
opportunity
to
elect
blacks
to
the
city
governing
board."
the
district
court
also
held
that
equal
opportunity
included
the
election
of
representatives
of
their
choice.
now,
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
only
way
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement
of
equal
protection
--
or
equal
participation
in
the
voting
processes
of
a
government
is
by
electing
a
black
to
the
mobile
governing
body.
now,
the
district
court
held
that
while
it
was
making
all
of
the
findings
about
various
subjects
that
i
just
mentioned,
that
blacks
did
not
participate
effectively,
and
we
say
this
is
a
clearly
erroneous
error
because
the
record
establishes
beyond
question
that
in
every
contested
election
in
the
city
of
mobile,
and
the
last
one
was
in
1973,
the
black
vote
is
decisive.
in
1973,
for
example,
commissioner
greenough
ran
against
commissioner
bailey,
who
had
defeated
commissioner
langan,
who
had
been
elected
and
re-elected
16
years
with
black
support.
and
in
the
first
election
he
received
only
15%
of
the
black
vote.
in
the
runoff
he
received
43
and
not
elected.
and
as
we
state
and
quote
on
pages
9
and
10
of
our
brief,
the
judge
is
questioning
reverend
hope,
who
is
the
black
president
of
the
non-partisan
voters
league,
and
he
asked
him,
"isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
black
vote
in
the
greenough
race
was
the
difference,
and
in
the
mims
race,
the
other
commissioner?”
and
he
said,
"yes."
and
then
in
addition
to
that,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
commissioner
doyle
had
no
opposition
but
he
testified
that
when
he
first
ran,
that
he
went
to
the
non-partisan
voters
league,
which
is
the
only
slating
organization
in
mobile
and
it's
black.
and
he
was
screened
by
them
and
they
endorsed
him.
and
each
one
of
these
appellants
have
gone
to
that
league
and
received
its
endorsement
after
being
screened
by
them.
and
so
the
blacks
do
participate
very
vigorously
in
the
electoral
processes
of
mobile.
and
so
i
say
that
where
the
elections
are
--
are
non-partisan
and
where
each
of
the
appellants
go
and
seek
the
black
vote,
and
where
it's
decisive,
it
cannot
be
said
to
be
submerged
or
diluted.
now,
the
reverend
hope,
when
he
was
testifying
in
his
final
statement
that
we
quote
on
page
10,
makes
just
one
sentence
which
i
would
like
to
quote
to
the
court
because
i
think
it's
important,
because
he
was
talking
about
the
fact
that
he
was
speaking
for
the
entire
league,
which
is
all
--
all
black
and
the
most
important
slating
organization.
he
said,
"they
feel
the
candidates
they
have
elected"
--
now
these
are
the
three
appellants
who
are
here,
and
by
"they"
he
means
the
non-partisan
voting
league
--
"have
done
a
very
good
job
along
that
line
of
--
of
serving
blacks."
and
over
and
over
again
this
record
is
full
of
instances
in
which
blacks
testified
that
when
they
supported
these
appellants,
they
went
down
to
city
hall
and
they
asked
for
what
they
wanted,
and
if
it
was
possible
in
law
and
money,
they
got
it.
and
i'm
not
going
to
read
the
long
list,
but
i
can
say
this,
eight,
the
only
eight
of
the
witnesses
of
the
plaintiffs
who
were
asked
if
they'd
been
down
to
city
hall,
and
under
this
open
door
policy
that's
maintained
by
these
commissioners
who
exercise
dual
functions
under
the
commission
form
of
government,
they
have
both
legislative
and
executive
powers
so
they
can
in
effect
do
it
all.
they
--
if
they
tell
one
of
these
blacks,
"we're
--
you're
going
to
get
a
pavement."
"you're
going
to
get
this."
they
get
it
because
they
have
the
power
to
do
it.
and
so
the
fact
that
they
not
only
take
part
in
the
entire
voting
process
from
registration
all
the
way
through
but
they
then
in
effect
collect
on
their
political
obligations
shows
that
they
play
an
extremely
important
part
in
the
political
processes
of
mobile.
now,
we
had
one
time
in
1973
where
three
blacks
ran
and
those
three
blacks
didn't
carry
the
black
wards.
now,
as
witness
alexander,
dan
alexander
who
is
a
witness
for
the
plaintiff,
testified
in
his
testimony
for
the
plaintiff,
an
election
for
a
commissioner
and
an
election
for
the
school
board
are
two
entirely
different
things.
when
you
run
for
the
school
board,
and
dan
alexander
is
a
member
of
the
school
board,
you
talk
about
what
you
can
do
for
the
school
kids
and
it's
county-wide.
when
you
run
for
commissioner,
you
talk
about
what
a
good
businessman
or
woman
you
are
because
the
commission
form
of
government
is
supposed
to
elect
businessmen
to
run
cities.
that's
why
it
came
into
existence
and
that's
why
over
and
over
again
when
they've
had
referendums
in
mobile
--
well,
they've
had
them
in
1963
and
1973,
according
to
--
to
the
record,
the
people
have
overwhelmingly
supported
this
businessman
form
of
local
government.
now,
the
court
below
held
that
the
intent
that
was
important
here
was
not
the
intent
of
the
three
defendants
but
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
now,
the
legislature
is
not
a
defendant
here.
no
state
official
is
a
defendant.
and
they
go
on
and
on
and
on
talking
about
bills
that
have
gone
up
to
montgomery
to
change
the
form
of
government.
and
when
you're
talking
about
legislative
intent
you're
talking
about
a
very
nebulous
thing.
but
in
their
supplemental
brief
they
cited
the
fact
that
senator
buskey,
a
black
senator,
had
introduced
a
bill
to
give
the
people
of
mobile
a
chance
to
vote
on
another
referendum
about
changing
its
government
and
they
go
on
and
on
about
how
the
fact
that
that
bill
went
through
the
house
and
then
lost
in
the
senate.
what
they
don't
tell
you
is
this,
that
that
bill
reached
the
senate
on
its
28th
legislative
day.
it
got
its
first
reading
that
very
day
which
is
very
unprecedented.
it
got
its
second
reading,
and
this
is
on
page
10
and
11
that
they
discuss
this,
its
second
reading
on
the
29th
legislative
day.
and
then
it
got
lost
in
the
usual
pile-up
of
bills
in
state
legislatures
on
that
last
day.
the
thing
that
--
that
interests
me
is
that
the
black
senator
from
mobile,
according
to
the
journal,
had
absolutely
nothing
to
say.
the
bill
died.
now
--
but
again,
it
was
a
--
going
to
give
the
people
of
mobile
a
chance
to
have
a
referendum.
so
i
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
relevant
intent
that
you're
going
to
consider
intent
is
that
of
the
three
defendants,
the
three
commissioners
that
are
before
you,
and
you
can't
find
in
this
record,
if
you
read
it
from
beginning
to
end,
any
instance
in
which
they
who
must
have
the
votes
of
the
blacks
to
win
have
discriminated
against
the
blacks.
the
black's
votes
are
equally
counted.
they
have
an
open
door
policy.
they
see
them.
and
as
i
say,
the
only
eight
witnesses
of
the
plaintiff
who
were
asked
testified
unequivocally
that
when
they
went
to
city
hall,
they
saw
the
appellants
and
they
got
what
they
went
for
if
it
was
legally
or
financially
possible.
and
so
it's
not
the
state
intent
that's
so
important
here.
it
is
the
intent
of
these
three
appellants.
if
it
was
the
state
intent,
why
don't
they
have
the
state
here?
yet
the
very
basis
of
the
district
court
decisions
and
the
very
basis
of
the
appellate
court
decision
is
the
inference
that
they
draw
from
the
fact
that
no
black,
and
the
district
court
repeats
this
three
times,
has
ever
won
a
seat
as
commissioner
of
mobile.
he
doesn't
add
the
next
part
of
it
which
is
that
no
qualified
blacks
ever
run.
and
the
other
inference
they
draw
is
that
state
inaction
is
circumstantial
evidence
of
invidious
intent
against
what?
these
three
appellants?
what
do
they
have
to
do
with
the
--
the
state
legislature's
intent?
and
it's
the
most
nebulous,
hardest
thing
to
get
at
in
the
whole
world.
it's
like
asking
barry
goldwater
what
senator
mcgovern's
intent
was
on
a
bill.
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
relevant
intent
is
that
of
the
state
legislature
but
the
relevant
intent
is
that
of
the
appellant
commissioners.
they're
the
only
defendants.
they're
the
only
ones
that
are
before
this
court.
and
so
i
urge
indeed
that
they
have
never
been
shown
to
have
a
racial
purpose.
they
have
been
shown
over
and
over
again
to
be
very
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
blacks.
and
there
is
no
racial
purpose
that
can
be
attributed
to
them
in
any
way
or
how
can
they
get
over
and
over
the
endorsement
of
the
blacks
and
how
can
they,
when
these
only
three
blacks
ran,
carry
even
the
black
wards?
so
another
point
that
i
would
make
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
a
very
strong
city
governmental
intent
in
at-large
elections
in
mobile
because
they
were
brought
in
to
wipe
out
ward
healing,
corrupt
government,
and
that
this
--
this
government
has
served
mobile
well
for
68
years
without
any
charges
of
corruption
or
--
or
anything
else.
and
that
is
the
good
government
that
they're
asking
this
court
to
uphold
the
abolition
of.
now,
the
failure
of
the
court
below
to
find
this
--
that
in
this
record
over
and
over
again
that
the
blacks
are
such
an
important
element
of
the
political
processes.
they
get
on
the
stand
and
they
brag
about
how
important
they
are.
wiley
bolden
said,
“sure,
they
follow
the
pink
sheet.”
that
the
pink
sheet
is
the
one
that
has
the
names
of
the
people
that
the
blacks
have
endorsed.
and
when
the
blacks
ran,
they
endorsed
some
of
the
blacks,
but
they
also
endorsed
the
whites
and
the
appellants.
so
i
urge
upon
you
that
the
intent
that
is
important
is
the
intent
of
these
appellants
that
they
have
done
absolutely
nothing
that
can
be
called
on
this
record
invidious
discrimination.no
black
has
ever
lost
an
election
in
mobile
because
of
polarized
voting.
and
if
you're
going
to
draw
inferences,
why
do
you
have
to
stop
--
they
--
they
point
to
montgomery,
they
point
to
birmingham
where
tomorrow
we
may
learn
something
because
the
men
who
got
more
votes
than
i
think
all
three
candidates,
white
candidates,
for
mayor
is
up
for
the
final
vote.
i
think
he
got
30-something-thousand
and
the
other
three
got
30-something-thousand.
but,
look
at
atlanta.
look
at
new
orleans.
look
at
detroit.
look
at
newark.
and
my
prime
example
of
all
and
--
because
i'm
leaving
to
go
out
there
tomorrow,
is
los
angeles.
look
at
bradley.
bradley
ran
when
only
17%
of
the
people
of
los
angeles
were
black.
he
was
defeated
the
first
time
around
but
he
pulled
himself
up
and
ran
again
and
he's
been
elected
over
and
over
and
over
again.
but
yet
in
here,
they
talk
about
discouragement
as
being
the
reason
that
no
qualified
black
has
ran
in
mobile
even
though
they
have
equal
opportunity,
equal
access,
equal
everything,
and
all
they
need
is
a
qualified
candidate.
now,
it's
true
that
on
the
record
there
was
some
dispute
about
whether
qualified
blacks
could
win.
the
interesting
thing
to
me
was
is
the
judge
was
working
over
mr.
langan,
who
had
won
for
16
years
straight
and
then
the
blacks
turned
against
him
so
he
lost.
he
was
trying
to
get
him
to
say
that
no
black
could
be
elected.
and
he
said,
"well,
it
depends
on
the
person."
and
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
that
the
color
of
a
man,
the
color
of
a
woman,
doesn't
count
in
politics
any
more,
it's
their
qualifications.
and
this
commission
form
of
government,
above
all
emphasizes,
as
dan
alexander
said,
the
business
capacity
of
those
who
want
to
be
commissioners.
another
aspect
of
this
is,
there
are
enormous
differences
between
a
city
and
a
state.
i
don't
think
that
your
decisions
that
relate
to
state
governments
really
apply
here.
if
you
wipe
out
a
multi-member
state
district,
it
doesn't
change
overall
the
state
government.
if
you
wipe
out
the
commission
form
of
government
in
mobile,
you
disestablish
the
whole
government
and
bring
in
a
whole
--
whole
new
government,
a
mayor
and
nine
councilmen
and
the
councilmen
meet
once
a
week
and
get
$50
for
a
meeting,
they
can
only
talk
to
the
mayor,
they're
not
allowed
to
talk
to
the
employees.
and
so
the
blacks
really
are
diluted
by
that
order
because
now
they
can
go
down
and
see
any
one
of
the
commissioners
and
get
anything
they
want,
talk
to
the
head
man,
because
they
see
them
all.
and
under
the
court's
order
they
have
to
go
down
and
see
the
mayor
and
wait
in
line,
and
they
don't
have
the
clout
under
the
order
that
they
have
now.
so
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
looks
like
there
would
be
three,
yes.
and
so,
now,
reverend
hope,
for
example,
would
have
one
of
those
who
he
could
go
see
and
he
would
go
down
to
city
hall.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
so
now,
as
the
situation
is,
according
to
his
testimony,
he
goes
down
and
sees
one
of
the
commissioners
directly,
and
the
commissioner
can
order
anything.
and
so
they
can
do
it
all.
so
actually
they're
being
diluted.
now,
the
--
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
comments
about
the
political
scientists
have
made
about
this.
they
say
that
the
form
of
government
is
--
local
government
is
peculiarly
something
for
the
people
of
the
locality.
i
think
i've
probably
read
more
charters
and
i
don't
mean
to
brag
about
it,
than
any
other
man
alive,
because
i've
lived
my
life
here.
i
once
went
out
to
--
to
denver
and
met
quigg
newton
and
people
when
they
were
redoing
the
denver
thing,
and
i
took
a
stack
of
charters.
i
can
tell
you
that
there
is
not
a
single
city
charter
that
is
identical
with
any
other.
they
are
always
adapted
to
the
needs
of
that
locality.
and
i'm
not
sure
if
the
courts
are
political
scientists
enough
to
tell
local
governments
what
kind
of
government
is
good
for
them.
but
i
come
back
to
the
point
i
mentioned
below
already,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
it
because
i
think
it's
important.
here,
we
have
a
good
government
being
wiped
out
based
on
inferences
and
circumstantial
evidence
and
--
as
against
the
record
of
the
election
of
qualified
blacks
nationwide.
to
me
it
just
doesn't
stand
up,
and
to
me,
the
constitutional
requirement
is
full
participation
in
the
political
process,
not
a
guarantee
of
end
result.
now,
we
talk
about
proportional
representation
of
a
race,
and
you've
said
you're
never
going
to
grant
that.i
once
went
out
to
cincinnati
and
talked
to
mayor
seasongood
for
half
a
day
trying
to
understand
proportional
representation.
i
never
did.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
--
i
suppose
that
you
did.
but
all
of
this,
thousand
over
ten
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff
kind
of
left
me.
now
--
so
i
conclude
by
simply
saying
that
this
case
is
enormously
important
not
just
to
mobile
but
to
the
67%
of
cities
throughout
the
nation
that
elect
at
large.
look
at
the
new
england
town
meeting.
there's
a
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
right.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
were
talking
about
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
oh,
yes.
they
pinned
everything
on
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
haven't
said
anything
about
some
of
the
zimmer
factors,
the
service
factors.
there
are
other
remedies
for
that
and
i
just
don't
think
they
belong
in
a
voting
rights
case
and
so
i
haven't
gone
into
that.
and
--
but
there's
no
question
but
what
both
courts
looked
to
the
intent
of
the
legislature,
not
the
intent
of
these
appellants,
because
if
you
look
to
the
intent
of
the
three
defendants
here,
it's
so
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
the
blacks.
there's
nothing
on
the
other
side.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
with
respect
to
the
voting
rights
act,
i
think
that
there
has
been
no
change
here
and
the
footnote
in
circuit
court
of
appeals,
footnote
14
where
they
say
it's
problematic,
they've
never
heard
of
it
being
applied
this
way
in
a
dilution
case.
i
don't
believe
the
voting
rights
act
has
any
application
whatever.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
was.
and
if
they
didn't
like
the
way
it
was
ruled
on
there
they
could
have
appealed
and
didn't
so
i
don't
think
it's
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
fifteenth
amendment,
the
district
court
really
didn't
say
anything
about
the
court
of
appeals,
said
it
required
intent,
so
you
--
they
really
brought
it
down
to
about
the
same
thing
as
--
as
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
again,
they
didn't
appeal
from
that
ruling
and
so
i
don't
think
it's
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
my
answer
would
be
that
it
cannot
be
on
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
right,
entirely.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
if
the
court
please,
i
only
have
two
comments
and
then,
unless
the
court
has
some
questions,
i
have
no
further
argument.
i'm
really
amazed
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
would
try
to
use
a
school
board
race
exhibit
on
593
and
a
county
commission
race
on
595
against
the
city.
i
pointed
out
in
my
argument
that
the
two
are
entirely
different
and
i
think
that
this
shows
how
weak
their
case
is
if
they
would
stoop
that
low.
now,
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
any
questions
the
court
has,
but
my
time
is
just
about
up
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
but
--
but
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
the
school
board
is
county-wide
and
the
county
is
county-wide.
it's
an
entirely
different
constituency,
as
mr.
alexander
pointed
out
in
the
record,
from
the
constituency
in
the
city.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
so
to
try
to
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
oh,
there's
some
overlap,
sure.
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
deny
that
for
one
minute.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
i
do.
it's
--
it's
lessening,
according
to
expert
boyles
and
that
more
and
more
throughout
the
south
as
well
as
in
mobile,
race
is
not
a
factor
in
elections.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
that
those
pamphlets
were
used
in
a
different
race,
for
a
different
purposes
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
city
and
that's
my
own
point
about
it.
thank
you.
