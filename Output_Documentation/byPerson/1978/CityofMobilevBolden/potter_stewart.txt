justice
potter
stewart
can
you
tell
me
mr.
rhyne,
i
know
that
commissioner
form
of
municipal
government
is
a
very
common
one
but
its
one
with
which
i
have
only
a
passing
familiarity.
commissioners
have
both
executive
and
legislative
powers?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
specialization's
been
true
only
fairly
recently.
the
--
the
commission
form
of
government
as
i
remember
from
reading
the
briefs
again
in
mobile
in
1911,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
specialization,
at
least
officially,
the
specialization
is
more
recent,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
always
been
an
effect
to
those
special
instances?
justice
potter
stewart
unlike
the
two.
justice
potter
stewart
but
am
i
then
correct
in
understanding
that
all
of
the
legislative
power,
and
all
of
the
executive
power
of
the
municipality
resigned
in
these
three
commissioners?
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
those
powers?
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
city
manager
for
the
government
of
course
the
city
managers
and
exclusively
an
executive.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
council
is
the
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
they
also
enact
the
ordinances,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
another
question?
did
they
run
as
a
trio
on
a
ticket?
i
know
it's
a
non-partisan
election,
at
least
that's
my
understanding
of
the
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all,
what
is
the
term
of
the
commissioner?
justice
potter
stewart
and
are
they
are
all
elected
at
the
same
time?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
--
do
they
run
as
a
slate
of
three?
justice
potter
stewart
and
have
negroes
been
--
they
have
run?
justice
potter
stewart
there
must
be.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
signature
requirement
of
any
instances?
justice
potter
stewart
the
city
council,
generally
speaking
as
a
generality
has
only
legislative
power?
justice
potter
stewart
not
executive.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
your
argument
mr.
rhyne
was
that
even
accepting
polarization
nothing
in
either
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment
requires
that
this
at-large
form
of
election
which
has
been
the
form
adopted
mobile
since
the
year
1911
to
be
altered,
even
accepting
that
negroes
voters
vote
negroes
and
white
voters
vote
white
people.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
fifteenth
amendment
or
any
other
part
of
it
that
requires
alabama
to
change
its
system
of
voting.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
one
man
one
vote
problem
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
deprivation
of
anybody's
voting
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
based
on
his
race
or
color.
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
the
proportional
representation
that
is
the
hare
system
of
proportional
representation
has
existed,
i
think
only
two
municipalities
in
united
states,
new
york
city
for
a
while
and
cincinnati,
ohio
for
a
longer
period
and
that
was
attack
as
being
unconstitutional
on
stage?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
want
an
argument
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
cincinnati
i
got
elected.
you
know,
i
thought
in
working
on
this
case
really,
one
of
the
most
interesting
things
was
the
footnote
that
mr.
justice
white
wrote
in
whitcomb
versus
chavis
where
he
pointed
out
that
a
white
man
won
in
a
black
ward,
and
a
black
man
won
a
in
a
white
ward,
and
i
hope
that
i
have
lived
to
see
the
day
where
that
is
america
because
if
you
start
carving
up
cities
just
because
you
got
to
guarantee
black
sits
on
the
governing
board,
you're
going
to
have
to
carve
out
in
almost
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
election
for
the
governor
of
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
executive
power
of
the
government
of
mobile
at-large
in
these
three
commissioners,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
so
in
that
extent,
there's
no
difference.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
constitution,
ultimately
what
you're
saying
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
constitution
requires
that
one
of
these
three
commissioners
be
a
negro.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
thrust
of
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
voter
is
still
not
always,
in
many
time,
i
am
sure
you've
shared
this
experience
was
many
of
the
others
who
are
fellow
citizens,
your
preferences
hasn't
been
nominated
by
either
party
or
any
party.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you're
voting
as
between
not
first
choices
of
yours?
justice
potter
stewart
yet
that's
not
involved
here,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
not
that
concept
was
in
reynolds
against
sims?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
the
original
one
person,
one
vote
was
a
purely
a
mathematical
concept
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
exclusively?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
--
just
go
ahead,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
says
so.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
municipalities
in
the
country,
if
you
know,
approximately
have
at-large
systems
of
voting
for
their
municipal
government?
justice
potter
stewart
most
of
them
do,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
a
majority?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
white
and
whitcomb
cases
involved
legislative
apportionment
or
reapportionment?
justice
potter
stewart
i.e.
that
it
involved
in
context
of
representative
democracy
and
in
the
legislative
area
and
at
least
arguably
this
system
is
more
like
a
statewide
election
of
governor,
quite
a
different
context,
at
least
arguably.
i
mean,
it's
not
all
that
clear
that
the
concepts
of
the
white
and
whitcomb
case
are
freely
translatable
into
this
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
more
like
a
hadley?
justice
potter
stewart
which
of
course
--
justice
potter
stewart
except
for
the
white
against
regester,
whitcomb
against
chavis
are
cases
have
dealt
with
the
one
man,
one
person,
one
vote
concept
which
hasn't
no
basis
on
the
attack
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
mentioned
the
voting
rights
act
as
your
predecessor
council
did.
do
you
think
that's
involved
here
at
all,
vote
rights
act
of
1965?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
1965
legislative
change,
which
formalized
the
specialization
among
the
commissioners
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
under
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
potter
stewart
why,
what
happened?
i
mean
you
ought
to
get
an
objection
to
it.
wouldn't
that
made
it
invalid,
didn't
it
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
attorney
general
had
an
objection
which
invalidated
or
at
least
suspended
the
operation
of
that
legislation
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
de
jure?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
predecessor
answered
as
i
understood
him
to
be
a
fact
that
if
there
were
in
fact
complete
dispersal,
racial
dispersal
and
all
the
geographic
areas
in
the
city
it
would
be
highly
unlikely
that
there
would
block
voting.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
two
go
together,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
the
time
of,
that
would
be
1836
or
later,
only
white
people
voted,
only
white
people
were
elected
to
the
school
board,
and
only
white
students
went
to
the
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
controversy
in
this
case
about
what
you've
told
us?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
non-paid
jobs.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
board
have
any
independent
taxing
power?
justice
potter
stewart
some
states
they
do
some
don't.
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
are
the
functions
of
the
members
of
the
school
board?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
not
my
question.
does
it
select
textbooks
and
those
things
or
is
that
done
at
the
state
level?
justice
potter
stewart
so
then
does
it,
i
suppose
it
promulgates
rules
and
regulations
but
except
in
that
sense
doesn't
have
legislative
power?
justice
potter
stewart
but
finally
a
policy
making
and
administrative
sort
of
body?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
they
may
not
be
important
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
the
partisan
in
this
--
they
republican
are
democrat
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
are
they
partisan
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
some
local?
justice
potter
stewart
yet,
the
municipal
elections
of
district
are
non-partisan.
justice
potter
stewart
formally,
it's
the
slating
as
the
sort
of
a
nomination
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
an
group
of
candidates
and
whom
in
turn
that
group
supports
then.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
primaries.
justice
potter
stewart
which
and
the
winner
of
the
primary
would
be
the
slated
candidate
knowing
the
candidate
--
justice
potter
stewart
who
would
be
supported
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
while
in
that
setting,
it
was
equivalent
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
nomination
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
an
organized
group?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
happen
in
this
county
here?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
the
nominee
if
you
run
in
the
primary,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
nomination
for
election
to
the
school
board
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
they
--
if
you
win
the
primary
then
you're
party
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
presumably
supports
you.
justice
potter
stewart
page
34
(a)
of
not
of
the
jurisdictional
statement?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
appendix
and
what
is
the
middle
paragraph?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
ultimately
it
is
the
voters,
isn't
it?
except
for
this
so-called
block
voting,
nothing
the
legislature
could
do
and
the
state
capital
or
the
city
or
the
school
board
could
do
or
could
prevent
negroes
being
elected?
justice
potter
stewart
but
ultimately,
it's
the
voters?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
to
and
that's
within
the
voluntary
control
of
each
individual
voter.
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
there
any
issue
here
as
to
--
is
there
any
claim
that
the
party
primary
the
democratic
primary
is
not
a
free
and
open
primary,
open
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
legislating
there
if
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
b-e-x-a-r?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
--
i
know
it
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
wasn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
just
a
nomination
by
a
party
primary
in
which
any
qualified
democrat
can
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
his
race?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all
conceded,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
secret
that
the
inside
groups
that
slates
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
no
claim
that
there
is?
justice
potter
stewart
are
the
two-court
rule
under
factual
finding?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
a
single
senator?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
remedy
decreed
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
predictably
there
would
be
a
minority
of
negroes
in
the
city
council,
wouldn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
they'd
be
a
minority?
justice
potter
stewart
after
he
have
to
run
under
it,
don't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rhyne,
before
you
sit
down,
you've
indicated
in
your
oral
argument
and
also
i
think
in
your
briefs
that
it's
your
position
that
only
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
involved
in
this
case
and
only
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
your
brothers
talk
about
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
as
well
as
the
fifteenth
amendment,
in
addition
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
gather
you
think
they're
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
part
of
the
--
was
that
included
as
a
ground
of
the
cause
of
action
in
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
they
--
if
the
judgment
can
be
supported
on
the
basis
of
either
the
statute
or
the
fifteenth
amendment
i
suppose
they're
entitled
to
support
it.
justice
potter
stewart
on
those
grounds,
on
either
of
those
grounds.
justice
potter
stewart
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
as
you
understand
them
were
grounded
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
helps
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
would,
rather
a
--
an
expression
of
unwillingness
to
join
in
forcing
a
state
to
do
anything,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
said
the
constitution
didn't
require
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
think
it
follows
that
the
constitution
does
require
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
well
no,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
part
of
the
constitution
are
you
relying
on
when
you
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
--
the
voting
rights
act,
that
is
the
section
with
which
this
court
has
dealt
primarily
has
to
do
with
a
--
a
change
in
the
method
of
--
in
some
scheme
or
device
or
some
change
in
the
--
in
the
method
of
election.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
rely
on
section
2,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
doesn't
purport
to
confer
any
private
cause
of
action,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
explicitly
do
so,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rely
on
the
voting
rights
act,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
could
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
it
in
a
footnote,
i
think,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
we
agree
that
that
was
a
knotty
question,
i
suppose
it
would
be
our
duty
to
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
we
thought
that
was
a
dispositive?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event
mr.
blacksher,
when
i
interrupted
you
with
my
question,
you
were
relying
on
the
constitution,
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
the
fifteenth
amendment,
not
the
fourteenth,
upon
which
you
rely?
justice
potter
stewart
because
reynolds
versus
sims
and
it's
all
those
related
cases
involve
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
and
that
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
case?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
those
rights
are
denied
when
you
have
an
at-large
election
for
the
governor
of
the
state
of
alabama,
for
example?
justice
potter
stewart
well
they
--
these
people
are
--
have
legislative
duties
but
they
also
have
executive
and
administrative
duties,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
a
pure
legislature.
this
is
not
representative
democracy.
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
simply
seeking
on
behalf
of
the
black
people
of
mobile
the
opportunity
to
participate
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
in
the
state
of
alabama
generally,
when
they
elect
the
governor?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
--
what
proportion
of
the
state
of
alabama
are
--
are
negro
voters?
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
ever
been
a
negro
governor
of
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
the
same
constitutional
claim
be
assertable
in
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
each
--
each
has
a
different
set
of
duties,
doesn't
he?
isn't
one
finance
and
the
other
safety,
or
something
and
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
--
it
is
true
now,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he's
the
executive
of
the
city
of
mobile?
justice
potter
stewart
who
is?
that's
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
but
the
three
commissioners
have
the
executive
power,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but

did
they?
justice

that's

isn't
that
an
issue,
one
of
the
issues
here
suggested
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
concurring
opinion
in

against
lipscomb?

stewart
you
haven't

you
haven't
talked
about
that
at
all.
justice

i
know
--
you're

you're
mixing
up
an
awful
lot
of
things.beer
was
a
--
was
a
voting
rights
act
case
not
a
constitutional
case.
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
those
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
those
and
they
came
under
the
statute.
justice

stewart
because
the
statute
covers
political
subdivisions.

right.
justice

right.

a
majority
of

of

of
the
population
generally?
justice

but
you
don't
know
about
the
voters
in

justice

stewart
is
that
the
same
league
that
we
heard

--
about
in
the
other
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
city
--
the

justice

stewart
not
just
two
organizations.
justice

with

thank
you.
justice

i

i

of
what?
of

--

stewart
34a
of
the
appendix?
justice

stewart
and
it
begins
at
the
top
of
the
page,
"this
is
not
to
say,"
quoting?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
wait
a
minute.
i
--
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
first
of
all,
i
didn't
understand
the
reference
to
me.i
think
it
was
intended
to
be
referenced
to
justice
white
but
that's
neither
here
nor
there
in
the
bakke
case.
what
--
what
i
don't
understand
here
is
--
is
what
you've
just
told
us
about
the
--
whether
or
not
the
private
right
of
action
under
title
ii,
section
2
exists.
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
in
this
case
didn't
rest
at
all
on
the
statute.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
the
court
of
appeals
relegated
the
issue
to
a
footnote,
is
that
also
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
did
the
footnote
say?
the
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
one
of
the
reasons
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)whole
a
lot
of
the
argument
was,
they
might
have
thought
offhand,
my
golly,
there's
no
private
right
of
action
under
section
2.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly
section
2
is
not
dispositive
and
couldn't
be
here
if
there
is
no
private
right
of
action
under
section
2.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
the
fifteenth
amendment
covers
texas.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
potter
stewart
section
2
covers
all
--
each
of
the
50
states
and
so
does
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
true
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
true
that
section
2
covers
every
state,
whatever
it
means.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
covers
every
state,
whatever
it
means.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
little
rhetoric
perhaps.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
view
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
consistent
with
the
--
the
court
opinion
in
gomillion
against
lightfoot?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
wasn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
there
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
in
the
gomillion
opinion,
which
i
have
not
read
recently,
upon
the
fact
that
this
could
--
this
particular
--
this
--
the
city
boundaries
in
that
case
could
only
here
been
attributable
to
an
intent
to
disenfranchise
non
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
non-whites?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
city
of
mobile,
alabama
has
since
1911
been
governed
by
a
city
commission
consisting
of
three
members
elected
by
the
voters
of
the
city
at
large.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
at
large
system
of
municipal
elections
violates
the
rights
of
mobile's
negro
voters
in
contravention
of
federal
statutory
or
constitutional
law
as
held
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
for
the
reasons
expressed
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
powell,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
have
concluded
that
mobile's
electoral
and
governmental
system
does
not
on
the
record
in
this
case
violate
the
united
states
constitution
or
federal
law.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
explaining
why
he
has
reached
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
accordingly,
the
judgment
before
us
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
statement.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
almost
all
of
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
also
joined.
