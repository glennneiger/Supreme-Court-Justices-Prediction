justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rhyne,
you've
just
explained
that
the
people
run
on
a
place
basis
here
in
mobile.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
grew
up
in
a
place
where
we
had
the
commission
form
of
government
but
each
one
was
appointed
by
the
mayor
to
the
public
works
or
public
safety
or
what
it
was.
but
here,
the
candidates
run
for
a
specific
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
some
prerequisites
for
getting
on
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
--
there
isn't
a
filing
fee?
i
suppose
some
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
a
signature
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
rhyne
before
you
go
on
with
that,
you
might
just
tell
me
why
you
thought
it
was
important
to
say
that
these
commissioners
either
formally
or
informally
stood
for
election
for
certain
positions.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
just
assume
that
they
didn't,
would
your
case
be
different?
let's
suppose
they
just
run,
all
they
run
was
for
three
commissioners
and
no
one
ever
knew
what
they
were
running
for
except
they
are
running
for
commissioners
and
they
have
the
full
legislative
power.
it
might
so
happen
that
after
they
were
elected,
one
would
assume
this
kind
of
executive
responsibility
and
one
would
assume
another.
but
suppose
they
just
run,
when
they
run
no
one
understood
anything
other
that
they
were
running
for
three
commissioners
exercising
legislative
power,
would
your
case
be
different
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
--
i
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
the
case
would
be
the
same
if
there
was
at-large
election
for
city
councilman.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
want
us
to
confine
our
decisions
or
to
address
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
commission
form
of
government
where
you
run
for
a
spot?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
bur
mr.
justice
stevens
points
out
that
the
district
courts
as
you
may
have
complete
access
until
the
voters
get
into
the
voting
booths
and
then
there's
voting
on
the
basis
of
color
and
no
black
has
ever
been
elected.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that's
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let's
just
assume
that
that
is
--
just
accept
those
findings
and
you
say,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
accept
the
findings
that
there
is
a
racial
voting
at
the
polls?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
based
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
at
some
point
in
the
process,
you
haven't
deliberate
discrimination
in
the
voting
booth.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
suggesting
but
i'm
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'll
call
it
polarization
then.
racial
voting
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rhyne,
i
suppose
it's
only
--
it's
just
the
residential
pattern
that
would
allow
that
would
afford
the
kind
of
a
remedy
the
district
court
gave
here.
if
blacks
and
whites
were
equally
distributed
around
the
city
of
mobile
and
yet
the
same
results
had
occurred
down
in
the
past
there
weren't
any
blacks
elected.
the
only
remedy
would
be
of
system
of
racial
proportional
representation,
but
this
single
member
district
remedy
would
only
work
because
of
residential
patterns
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
residential
segregation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
after
the
election
they
then
decide
which
of
them
would
take
what
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
discrimination
in
this
case
was
effected
in
the
voting
booths,
is
that
where
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
our
city
should
not
provide
the
kind
of
a
system
that
makes
effective
that
kind
of
voting,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
at-large
--
at-large
voting
is
just
in
the
cities
say
is
out
is
unconstitutional
if
over
a
period
of
time
a
substantial
black
or
some
other
minority
group
is
without
representation
and
that
the
court
finds
that
there
is
discriminatory
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do
in
this
case,
if
the
blacks
and
the
whites
have
been
equally
distributed
throughout
the
city
rather
than
what
would
have
been
your
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
will
make
the
same
argument
about
catholics
or
jews
or
any
other
identifiable
group
that
live
in
some
area,
i
suppose,
italians,
poles,
and
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
making
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
factual
answer
to
my
question.
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
has
the
case
of
controversy
versus
with
whom
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
or
controversy
does
a
name
--
do
the
named
plaintiffs
have
with
the
city
of
mobile?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
ever
run
everyone
in
the
world?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
named
plaintiffs?
justice
byron
r.
white
general
turner,
are
you
drawing
distinction
between
the
two
cases
that
are
before
us,
the
one
involved
in
commissioners
and
the
one
involved
in
the
school
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
suppose,
suppose
in
mobile
let's
run
the
way
it
is
but
in
the
adjoining
city,
democrats
always
been
the
general
elections
but
the
candidates
get
put
up,
are
chosen
by
the
democratic
party
in
it's
own
low
conclave
at
a
convention
or
in
a
back
room
somewhere
and
it's
freely
conceded
that
in
the
choosing
of
the
democratic
candidates
in
the
general
election
that
there
is
racial
voting.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
just
that
the
people
the
people
who
are
getting
together
in
the
democratic
party
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
are
getting
together
in
the
backroom.
there's
plenty
of
negroes
there
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
there
are
more
whites.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
backroom
they
all
---
they
have
show
hands
and
they
make
nominations
and
some
win
and
some
lose
and
always
the
whites
win
and
the
blacks
lose
and
then
the
party
comes
up
with
this,
if
you
want
to
call
this
slate
of
white
candidates.
would
that
be
the
same
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
only
people
who
go
into
a
democratic
primary
are
the
registered
democrats.
and
the
only
people
in
the
backroom
in
the
adjoining
city
are
the
democrats
who
choose
candidates.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
has
there
any
been
a
negro
in
the
--
on
ballot
of
the
general
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
the
election,
there's
never
been
a
democratic
candidate
who
is
a
negro
in
the
general
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that,
one
of
the
operative
facts
in
the
exclusion
or
the
failure
of
negroes
to
be
nominated
or
to
be
elected
in
one
of
the
operating
facts
is
the
block
voting.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
is
--
so
that
there
is
a
--
certainly
there
is
purposeful
exclusion
of
negroes
from
office
but
i
suppose
your
answer
to
that
is
well
the
state
is
just
not
responsible.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there's
no
question
whatsoever
and
i
take
it
from
--
it
argues
of
anybody
that
at
some
point
in
this
process
there
is
purposeful
exclusion
it's
just
a
question
of
by
whom.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
whitcomb
against
smokey
(ph)
might
become
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
hope.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fifteenth?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
isn't
state
action.
i
take
it
is
that
here's
as
a
state
or
a
city
that
provides
a
primary
mechanism
for
the
selection
of
candidates
and
it
permits
a
--
and
within
that
system
deliberate
discrimination
goes
on
by
the
people
who
entered
the
ballot
box.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
anybody
who
get
on
the
general
election
ballot
except
by
the
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
haven't
quite
explained
on
your
theory
why
you
think
the
fifteenth
amendment
claim
is
any
different
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
claim?
or
with
--
with
respect
to
how
the
state
is
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
--
the
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
still
has
to
be
made
by
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
tell
me
how
the
state
is
involved
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
say
the
state
is
efficiently
involved
if
it
maintains
the
system
which
permits
individual
discrimination
at
the
polls?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
it,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
we
decide
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
a
city
has
got
clear
--
if
a
city
--
if
the
republicans
and
the
democrats
are
segregated
by
area
in
a
city,
do
you
think
a
city
may
draw
their
--
their
electoral
districts
based
on
those
lines
so
as
to
clearly
to
determine
--
predetermine
who's
going
to
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
let's
assume
that
there'd
never
been
a
republican
elected
in
mobile
in
history.
i
suppose
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
--
let's
suppose
that
it
--
that
it
had
been,
a
history
like
that.
and
--
and
you
--
and
it
was
--
there
was
proof
that
it
was
--
that
the
at-large
system
was
maintained
to
maintain
the
democratic
majority
and
the
democratic
control.
now,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
would
--
you
would
say
that
you
would
come
out
the
same
way
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
--
i
know
it
is
possible,
but
how
about
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
would
you
be
making
this
same
argument
here
or
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
--
it
depends
a
lot
i
suppose
it
--
whether
you
are
or
not
depends
on
how
strong
your
fourteenth
amendment
argument
is
as
distinguished
from
your
fifteenth
and
your
voting
rights
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
i
suppose
in
the
voting
rights
act
because
you
claim
it
covers
effect
as
well
as
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
--
i
know
but
you
wouldn't
even
need
to
affirm
that,
you
could
assume
it
if
you
take
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there's
a
purpose
rather
than
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do
but
--
but
if
we
weren't
convinced
on
purpose,
you
would
say,
well,
nevertheless
there
is
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
there
were
a
private
cause
of
action
in
the
voting
rights
act,
what
do
you
say
about
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
government
doesn't
think
necessarily
that
purpose
is
essential
in
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
not
--
you're
not
really
making
much
of
a
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
--
let
me
--
let
me
go
at
this
in
--
in
two
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
two
steps.
one,
do
you
think
the
argument
is
available
in
this
court
by
an
appellee
that
the
voting
rights
act
is
an
issue
here
and
should
be
disposed
of
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
voting
rights
act
covers
effect
as
well
as
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
issue
is
fairly
--
the
issue
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
fairly
here,
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
issue
of
the
voting
rights
act
covering
effect
as
well
as
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
that,
as
you
understand
our
cases,
we
should
dealing
with
the
voting
rights
act
first
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
any
opinion
that
we
write
in
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
least
--
at
least
either
--
either
on
--
on
the
merits
or
at
least
put
the
issue
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
--
i
take
it
as
--
pretty
fairly
your
position
that
a
municipal
at-large
election
or
a
--
for
the
purposes
of
state
legislatures,
a
--
say,
a
county-wide
at-large
election
or
--
or
a
multi-number
district,
electoral
district
for
the
election
of,
say,
10
state
representatives,
neither
of
those
arrangements
at-large
is
--
is
shown
to
be
unconstitutional
if
you
have
also
a
very
clear
proof
of
voting
on
racial
lines
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
--
let's
say
anybody
in
his
right
mind
would
say
yes,
there's
pretty
clearly
racial
lines
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
putting
those
two
together,
it
doesn't
--
equals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
parties
must
reach
--
raise
a
possible
statutory
issue
along
with
a
constitutional
issue?
i
suppose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
parties
constructed
their
case
just
as
a
constitutional
case,
if
they
want
to,
can't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
unwise
but
they
--
but
they
may.
but
i
--
it
may
be
--
i
suppose
your
answer
might
be
that
even
if
they
do,
perhaps
here
the
court
would
have,
if
it's
to
come
--
they
come
from
federal
courts,
you
--
i
suppose
this
court
would
have
the
power
to
insert
another
issue
into
it.
but
you
wouldn't
say
it
was
error
for
lower
courts
to
decide
the
constitutional
issue
if
the
parties
had
never
raised
anything
but
the
constitutional
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
do
you
mean,
still
in
existence
or
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
do
you
mean,
still
in
existence?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
equivalent
to
purpose
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
from
what
you
answered
me
before
or
an
answer
to
someone,
when
you
were
up
before,
that
if
--
if
it
were
satisfactorily
shown
that
a
multi-member
district
was
adopted
or
that
if
it
was
refused
to
dissolve
it
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
effects
of
racial
block
voting
that
you
would
have
a
tough
time
defending
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
all
--
you
can
have
all
the
legislative
purpose
you
want
but
if
--
if
the
racial
block
voting
suddenly
falls
apart
and
they
start
voting
on
the
merits
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
