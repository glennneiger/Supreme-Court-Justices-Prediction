mr.
william
h.
allen
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
part
of
these
proceedings
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
the
way
mobile
county's
school
commissioners
are
elected
and
since
no
later
than
1836,
these
commissioners,
the
members
of
the
mobile
county
school
board,
if
you
will,
had
been
elected
by
the
voters
of
the
county
at-large.
there
were
so
elected
when
this
action
was
brought
by
black
residents
of
the
county
complaining
that
this
at-large
electoral
system
unconstitutionally
diluted
their
voting
power.
as
you
have
heard,
blacks
make
up
about
a
third
of
the
population
of
mobile
county
slightly
greater
proportion
of
the
population
the
city
itself
that
is
around
the
third
the
entire
county.
the
district
court
sustained
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
and
the
court
of
appeals
summarily
affirmed.
the
issue
that
is
posed
by
that
decision
is
whether
an
at-large
method
of
election
in
a
school
district
that
has
a
significant
black
minority
is
unconstitutional
merely
because
there
is
racially
polarized
voting
and
black
minority
candidates
have
not
been
elected
to
the
board
however
deeply
rooted
the
at-
large
method
of
election
may
be
in
history
and
non-racial
policy.
i
hope
in
describing
the
proceedings
and
the
decisions
below
to
demonstrate
that
the
case
poses
the
issue
just
that
boldly.
then
i
will
try
to
explain
why
the
resolution
of
that
issue
by
the
district
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
inconsistent
with
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
with
this
court's
decisions
construing
them.
but
first,
the
facts
and
how
they
give
rise
to
the
issue
i've
stated.
the
longstanding
commitment
of
alabama
to
the
at-large
election
of
the
members
of
the
governing
body
of
the
mobile
county
schools
is
undoubted.
the
pub
--
the
mobile
public
school
system
was
established
in
1826,
28
years
before
a
statewide
system
of
schools
and
public
school
was
established
in
alabama.
either
that
original
enabling
act
in
1826
that
seems
to
be
ambiguous
or
if
not
that
then
a
replacement
stature,
there
was
an
act
in
1836,
established
a
system
of
at-large
election
that
has
prevailed
continuously
since.
as
your
honors,
had
may
have
learned
from
the
perusal
of
the
briefs,
the
statute
that
provided
for
single-member
districts
was
an
enacted
in
1975
but
was
voided
because
of
a
technical
defect
in
the
giving
of
notice.
the
original
provision
for
the
at-large
election
of
mobile
county
school
commissioners
in
the
early
1800's
and
the
enactment
in
1919
of
the
at-large
election
legislation
that
governs
today
were
not
motivated
by
any
consideration
of
the
impact
that
at-large
voting
might
have
on
black
residents.
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
no
one
thought
of
the
possibility
that
blacks
might
vote
at
that
time
in
1836.
in
1919,
when
the
present
enabling
statue
was
enacted,
blacks
have
been
effectively
disenfranchised
in
alabama
by
the
constitution
of
1901,
a
situation
that
prevailed
until
about
the
time
of
the
second
world
war
and
shortly
thereafter.
now,
there's
another
key
fact
that
appears
from
the
record.
notwithstanding,
the
history
of
which
we're
all
aware
and
to
which
government
counsel
referred,
of
racial
discrimination
in
many,
many
aspects
of
the
life
of
alabama,
there
are
today
no
formal
or
informal
barriers
to
full
participation
by
black
residents
in
the
political
process
in
mobile
county
including
in
particular
school
board
elections.
blacks
are
able
freely
to
register
and
to
vote,
they
participate
in
both
parties
in
the
partisan
process
that
leads
to
the
election
of
school
board
members.
any
candidate
who's
interested
in
running
for
the
school
board
may
do
so,
and
it
doesn't
cost
much
to
run
for
the
school
board.
mr.
william
h.
allen
up
to
this
point,
i
am
paraphrasing
findings
of
the
district
court.
i
am
paraphrasing
findings.
he
did
not
advert
to
this
other
possible
obstacle
but
campaign
cost,
but
in
fact
there
is
testimony
that
cost
them
no
more
than
$5,000.00
more
usually
about
$2,000.00
to
mount
a
perfectly
effectively
campaign
in
the
office.
mr.
william
h.
allen
they're
non-paid
job
tab
them
up
to
very
recently.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i've
--
i've
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--
the
--
the
school
board
is
like
any
other
traditional
american
school
board,
it
sets
policy
and
it
hires
the
executive
in
higher
school
superintendent.
he's
not
elected
separately,
so
that
executive
responsibility
ultimately
is
lodged
in
the
school
board
members
and
i
take
it
and
this
is
highly
personal
knowledge
just
from
acquaintanceship
with
neighbors
that
school
board
members
are
held
very
closely
accountable
for
what
goes
on
in
schools
by
the,
by
parents
and
others
who
are
interested.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
i
do
not
know.
no,
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
that's
correct,
yes.
yes,
no
this
board
apparently
is.
mr.
william
h.
allen
to
set
and
make
policy
about
the
schools,
to
design
on
school
construction.
to
hire
the
superintended
certainly
and
ultimately
i
would
guess
to
decide
on
hirings,
if
it's
a
typical
school
board.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
does
select
textbooks.
mr.
william
h.
allen
legislative
power
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
that
quite
means
in
this
contest
but
it
does
whatever
policy
is
to
be
made
it
makes,
if
that
is
what
legislation
is.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes
and
it
combines
the
two
functions
i
think
it's
fair,
i'm
sorry
that
i'm
afraid
this
was
all
taken
much
for
granted
and
doesn't
appear
on
the
record
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
--
i
apologize
but
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
approximately
the
situation.
let
me
go
on.
in
addition,
another
fact
that
appears
there's
no
white-oriented
slating
organization
operating
in
mobile
county.
mobile
county,
the
school
election,
i
should
emphasize
are
different
from
the
city
elections
and
that
they
are
partisan
but
the
fact
is
that
the
only
effective
political
endorsing
organization
is
the
non-partisan
voters
league
which
is
a
predominantly
black
organization.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no.
mr.
william
h.
allen
they
are
partisan
in
republican-democrat,
which
i
think,
has
traditionally
meant
democrat.
the
primary
and
the
run-off
primary
election
are
the
decisive
elections
or
that
appears.
mr.
william
h.
allen
they
are
non-partisan.
now
as
i've
indicated,
what
i've
recited
heretofore
are
findings
that
made
by
judge
pittman
and
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
judge
pittman
also
found
that
there
was
racially
polarized
voting
in
mobile
county
and
he
said
further
that
this
tendency
to
vote
according
to
race
made
it
difficult
for
a
black
person,
a
member
of
this
minority
to
be
elected
to
the
school
board
in
at-large
election.
in
fact,
four
black
candidates
run
for
the
school
board
between
1962
and
1974.
each
of
them
was
running
for
office
for
the
first
time,
each
of
them
reached
the
run-off,
none
was
elected.
judge
pittman
looked
at
these
facts
in
the
course
of
an
analysis
of
the
case
that
he
felt
himself
compelled
to
follow
because
of
the
court
of
appeal's
decisions
in
zimmer
against
mckeithen
and
other
cases
that
have
followed
zimmer
which
have
made
the
zimmer
factors
decisive
in
fifth
circuit
voting
delusion
cases.
you
can't
really
understand
what
happened
below
not
knowing
something
about
these
zimmer
factors.
and
the
first
zimmer
factor
that
judge
pittman
analyzed
relates
to
minority
access
to
the
slating
or
candidate
selection
process.
he
made
a
finding,
nominally
a
finding
that
blacks
were
denied
equal
access
to
the
slating
or
candidate
selection
process
i
quote
in
there.
but
this
finding
was
obviously
a
mere
function
of
his
view
that
potential
black
candidates
were
discouraged
from
running
because
of
the
history
of
losing
elections.
and
the
candidates
lost
those
elections
because
they
were
members
of
a
racial
minority
in
a
community
in
which
there
was
racially
polarized
voting.
i
submit
that
in
truth
that
it
is
to
saying
nothing
more
than
that
racially
polarized
voting
has
prevailed
in
mobile
county.
that
is
all
that
that
lack
of
access,
conclusion.
i
will
not
dignify
it
by
calling
it
a
finding
of
the
district
court
amounts
to.
mr.
william
h.
allen
nomina
--
for
that
--
for
the
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
that's
right.
but
what
the
district
judge
was
saying
was,
he
had
found
initially
that
there's
nothing
to
prevent
anybody
from
running
in
the
democratic
primary.
one
is
freely
able
to
run
and
there's
no
organization
that
controls
who
has
access
to
the
primary.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
william
h.
allen
they've
--
they
run
in
primaries,
your
honor.
they
have
not
been
elected.
they
have
not
been
selected
in
the
primary
that's
what
he
was
relying.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
democratic
that
he
was
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
not
at
all.
not
at
all.
it
was
a
democratic
primary.
mr.
william
h.
allen
oh!
yes,
your
honor
but
he
was
talking
about
the
habit
of
democratic
voters
of
voting
according
to
race.
that's
what
he
was
talking
about
in
there.
mr.
william
h.
allen
in
the
primaries,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
would
be
the
party
candidate.
mr.
william
h.
allen
what
i
understand
that
the
slating
--
the
slating
criteria
and
has
derived
from
white
against
regester
has
to
do
with
an
earlier
stage
in
the
process
where
a
group
was
put
up
with
some
sort
of
sanction
in
the
democratic
party.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
but
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
my
understanding
is
that
an
organization
within
the
democratic
party.
the
leadership
if
one
will,
they
put
up
a
slate
of
candidates
in
the
primary
and
that
slate,
either
nobody
runs
against
them
or
they
always
win.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
my
understanding
from
white
against
regester,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
william
h.
allen
you
run
in
the
primary.
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
then
you
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
you
win
the
election
has
been
true
up
till
now
if
you're
a
democrat.
mr.
william
h.
allen
racial
voting
nothing
more
than
that?
or
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
understand
what
you're
telling.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
guess
your
honor
i
think
it
would
depend
--
i've
not
thought
precisely
about
that
but
it
would
depend,
i
take
it
on
whether
one
were
at
the
poll
of
a
real
election
or
at
a
poll
of
the
backroom
deal
that
determines
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
are
some
are
the
registered
democrats.
i
suggest
that
may
make
a
difference,
your
honor.
i
suggest
that
may
make
a
difference,
that
here
where
one
has
unquestioned
access
to
a
very
formal
method
of
choosing
candidates
that
amounts,
that
amounts
in
this
community
to
election.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
negroes
are
able
to
run
in
the
democratic
primary
without
hindrance.
mr.
william
h.
allen
they
have
not
won
a
primary
run-off
election.
that
is
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
they
had
never
been
the
democratic
nominee.
that
none
of
them
has
been
the
democratic
nominee.
mr.
william
h.
allen
if
he
meant
anything
by
the
slate
that
had
to
be,
what
he
meant
and
he
meant
again
that
it
was
result
of
people's
action
in
the
polling
booth
that
blacks
were
not
able
to
be
the
democratic
party
nominees.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
the
democratic
primary.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
your
honor
that
is
what
this
record
shows
is
that
there
was
a
free
and
formal
primary
election.
mr.
william
h.
allen
in
the
general
election?
in
an
at-large
election?
i
just
don't
know
whether
other
parties
or
republicans
had
put
up
and
it
was
taken
for
granted
on
this
record
that
the
democratic
nomination
that
matters
to
the
election.
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
for
the
school
board
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
no,
they
run
four
times,
i
mean
different
black
candidates
run
four
times
in
the
period
we're
concerned
with
each
among
got
to
the
run-off,
each
of
them
was
failed
of
nomination.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that's
correct
your
honor,
exactly
correct.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it's
a
non-paying
job,
anybody
apparently
five,
six,
eight
people
run
each
time
for
each
of
these
positions
and
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
judge
know
more
about
it
than
you
and
i
but
i
really
think
i
am
faithfully
rendering
what
the
judge
said
your
honor
i
mean,
the
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
no,
no.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
allen
public
service,
whatever
motivates
people
to
undertake
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
public
serv
--
public
service,
that's
correct
your
honor
yes,
yes.
the
--
i
will
skip
over
for
a
moment
a
couple
of
the
zimmer
factors
that
the
district
judge
and
just
state
that
his
overall
conclusion
was
quite
predictable.
he
paraphrased
passages
from
some
of
these
courts
voting
delusion
opinions
and
then
he
concluded
that
the
plaintiffs
had
met
their
burden
by
showing
an
aggregate
of
the
factors
catalogue
in
zimmer,
and
the
court's
remedy
for
this
constitutional
violation
had
therefore
found
was
also
predictable.
judge
pittman
professed
not
to
endorse
quota
voting
or
quota
elections
but
he
adopted
a
plan
that
was
designed,
these
are
his
words.
to
provide
blacks
a
realistic
opportunity
to
elect
blacks
to
the
board
of
school
commissioners.
in
fact,
two
of
the
five
single
member
districts
that
he
created
would
have
weighted
--
would
have
weighted
black
populations
of
more
than
55%
and
the
remaining
three
districts
would
have
weighted
black
populations
of
less
then
14%.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
decision
according
to
the
zimmer
factors.
it
said
that
the
district
court
that
applied
the
proper
standards
and
that
he's
findings
were
not
clearly
erroneous
and
decided
just
one
case
the
decision
of
a
different
panel
on
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
city
of
mobile's
case.
now
a
good
deal
of
argument
has
gone
on
about
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
thereby
decided
and
whether
in
particular
the
court
of
appeals
decided
and
whether
it
is
necessary
to
make
out
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
show
purposeful
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
state.
the
correctness
of
that
view
which
i
think
clearly
is
correct
that
purposefulness
is
required
is
contested.
so
let
me
turn
first
by
way
of
analysis
of
that
to
a
couple
of
points
that
i
think
cannot
be
contested.
one
is
that
no
one
has
asserted
or
even
suggested
that
the
at-large
system
here
was
conceived
in
racial
animus
with
a
deliberate
purpose
of
discriminating
against
blacks
or
submerging
the
votes
of
blacks.
the
second
is
that
the
district
court
made
its
decision
on
the
basis
of
an
understanding
that
the
court
of
appeals
as
zimmer
factors
captured
the
effects
of
an
at-large
system
on
minority
voters
and
candidates
not
on
the
understanding
that
those
factors
go
to
an
intent
to
discriminate.
at
that
point
we
get
into
more
contentious
ground.
at
one
point
in
his
opinion,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
referred
to
the
parallel
point
in
this
opinion
in
the
city
of
mobile's
case,
at
one
point
in
his
opinion
removed
from
his
zimmer
analysis.
judge
pitts
--
judge
pittman
said
that
it
was
possible
to
perceive
a
present
purpose
to
dilute
black
votes
based
on
legislative
in
action,
based
on
the
failure
of
the
legislature
to
do
anything
about
this
at-large
system
that
had
been
created
so
many
years
before.
i
can
think
that
the
person
reading
that
passage,
it's
at
page
34
(a)
of
the
appendix
in
our
case,
will
agree
that
this
is
no
finding.
no
finding
of
a
present
purpose
to
discriminate
even
though
that's
how
the
plaintiffs
now
like
to
describe
it.
it's
in
a
section
titled
“conclusions
of
law.”
it's
not
proceeded
by
any
factual
analysis,
it's
exactly
the
same
language
that
used
in
the
different,
factually
different
city
of
mobile
case
yet
it
simply
--
i
think
fairly
cannot
be
considered
a
finding
to
which
any
deference
is
owed.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
of
the
appendix.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes,
the
middle
paragraph,
the
last
two
paragraphs,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
in
what
respect
your
honor?
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
are
differences.
i
think
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
no.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes,
i'm
persuaded
of
that,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
didn't
suggest
that
there
was
--
i'm
sorry
i
can't
understand
your
honor's
question
now.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
the
presence
of
such
evidence.
i
merely
meant
that
there
was
no
rule
or
factual
analysis
that
preceded
this
statement
in
either
case.
in
either
--
no
it's
exactly
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
was
not
that
same
kind
of
thing
here
that's
quite
right,
your
honor,
yes
so
to
that
extent
it
may
be
different
but
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
if
--
if
there
were
some
evidence
that
the
legislature
had
deliberately
acted
lately
to
ratify
or
otherwise
to
confirm
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
can
imagine
a
case
of
that
sort
of
thing
being
different.
i
think
it
is
a
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
it's
a
dangerous
inquiry
to
get
into,
your
honor.
the
difficulty
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
well
it
may
--
i
don't
just,
i'm
not
that
well-versed
in
the
legislative
goings
on
in
the
other
case
to
know
that
but
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
and
what
i
said
in
comparing
the
two.
the
--
i
was
at
the
point
where
we
were
talking
about
whether
a
present
purpose
to
discriminate
was
found
here
and
in
its
opinion,
in
the
city
of
mobile's
case
which
was
cited,
in
this
case
is
decisional
authority.
the
court
of
appeals
was
more
specific.
it
said
in
that
case
that
when
you've
aggregated
the
zimmer
factors
and
they
add
up
to
voting
delusion,
then
at
least
when
the
delusion
is
longstanding,
there's
the
requisite
intent
if
the
legislative
body
has
not
acted
to
change
the
situation.
that
is
substantially
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
i
understand
but
that
sort
of
intent
i
submit
is
a
construct.
it's
artificial.
it's
the
same
as
saying
really
that
the
zimmer
factors
themselves
are
enough
if
the
system
of
at-large
elections
is
old
enough
to
permit
of
the
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
there's
--
that
is
all
that's
a
bit,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
it.
mr.
william
h.
allen
oh,
yes.
yes,
there
seems
to
be
a
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
state
is
not
responsible
i
think
none
of
this
court's
decisions
comprehends
a
state
action.
the
action
of
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
by
whom
and
it's
by
individual
voters
of
voting
their
will.
that
that
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i
suggest
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
says
--
well
it
requires
action
by
state
or
the
united
states,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
fifteenth
shall
not
be
abridge,
denied
or
abridged
by
the
united
states
or
any
state
on
account
of
race,
color
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
but
they
seem
to
vote
according
to
race
and
at
least
some
races
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
what
it
amounts
to.
mr.
william
h.
allen
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
h.
allen
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
legality
of
the
way
the
commissioners,
the
school
commissioners
of
mobile
county
are
elected.
mobile
county
encompasses
the
city
of
mobile
and
a
rather
large
surrounding
area
which
includes
some
other
smaller
cities.
overall,
the
population
of
the
county
is
divided
racially
in
about
the
same
proportions
as
the
city.
blacks
make
up
32%
of
the
county's
population
and
i
think
24%
of
its
voters.
mobile
county's
school
system
was
the
first
to
be
established
in
alabama
in
1826,
seven
years
after
statehood.
since
that
time
probably,
and
at
least
since
1836,
when
a
new
statute
governing
the
school
system
was
enacted,
the
members
of
the
governing
body
of
the
school
system
have
been
elected
from
the
county
at
large.
the
current
statute
under
which
they
have
been
elected,
it
was
enacted
in
1919,
provides
for
the
at-large
election
of
five
commissioners.
they
are
elected
in
partisan
elections
held
in
even
numbered
years
for
six-year
staggered
terms.
as
a
board,
the
commissioners
are
responsible
for
the
overall
direction
and
management
of
the
mobile
county
schools.
they
hire
a
superintendent
who
is
responsible
under
their
direction
for
the
day-to-day
management.
now,
certain
salient
points
appear
from
the
findings
below
and
the
--
or
the
undisputed
evidence
of
record
concerning
the
school
board's
elections
and
their
relation
to
the
black
population
of
the
county.
first,
the
system
of
at-large
elections
for
mobile
county
school
board
members
was
not
created
for
any
racially
discriminatory
reasons.
as
i
have
already
indicated
the
system
has
deep
roots
in
the
history
of
alabama
and
of
mobile
in
particular.
it
was
first
established
in
1836,
no
later,
at
a
time
when
blacks
did
not
vote
and
the
last
reestablished
in
1919
at
a
time
when
blacks
were
still
effectively
disfranchised.
second,
the
second
salient
point
notwithstanding
the
history
of
racial
discrimination
in
alabama
and
mobile,
there
are
today
no
barriers,
no
barriers
formal
or
informal
to
black
participation
in
mobile
county's
political
process.
blacks
are
free
to
register
and
vote
and
they
do
vote
nearly
in
proportion
to
their
proportion
of
the
voting
age
population.
their
votes
are
sought
for.
the
only
significant
candidate
endorsing
body
that
appears
to
operate
county-wide
in
mobile
county
is
what
you
have
heard
about,
that's
the
non-partisan
voters
league.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
that
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
operates
in
the
county
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--
and
city
as
well,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
the
same
organization.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
they're
predominantly
a
black
group.
and
there's
no
comparable
white
group,
there's
no
backstage
or
--
or
even
front-stage
slating
organizations
of
the
kind
the
court
may
have
been
concerned
with
in
some
other
cases,
no
slating
really
in
that
sense.
mr.
william
h.
allen
this
--
in
my
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
is
not,
your
honor.
one
can
infer
that
the
advertisements
were
paid
for
by
the
candidate
running
against
the
candidate
who
is
--
who
is
disfavored
in
those
ads,
if
that's
what
your
honor
means.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
i
--
there
is
--
there
is
no
evident
--
record
evidence
about
the
sources
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--
of
campaign
funds.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
but
in
any
event,
in
that
regard,
anyone
is
free
to
run
for
office
and
--
and
the
fact
is
that
a
school
board
campaign
does
not
cost
very
much.
up
until
very
recently
--
up
until
very
recently,
the
school
board
members
have
not
been
paid
at
all
and
they're
still
paid
rather
nominally.
so
a
typical
campaign
budget
runs
no
more
than
$2,000,
$3,000,
$5,000,
it's
according
to
the
record.
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
are
five
members.
mr.
william
h.
allen
they
are
elected
for
six-year
staggered
terms,
they're
two,
two,
and
one
system.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
--
it
is
a
per
--
per
meeting
kind
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--
of
compensation
now.
yes,
yes,
yes.
now,
the
third
salient
point,
and
i
have
to
acknowledge
this
on
the
record
of
this
case,
whatever
may
be
the
case
in
the
city's
case,
there
does
appear
to
be
racial
polarization
in
voting.
four
black
candidates
ran
in
the
democratic
primary
for
the
school
board
between
1962
and
1974.
each
of
them
reached
the
runoff
election,
although
each
was
a
first-time
candidate
for
public
office.
each
was
defeated
in
a
runoff
against
a
white
opponent.
now,
on
the
basis
substantially
of
what
i've
recited
plus
a
few
more
rather
tangential
items,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
at-large
manner
of
electing
mobile
county
school
commissioners
violates
the
fourteenth
and
perhaps
the
fifteenth
amendments.
the
district
court
made
its
analysis
of
this
issue
within
the
framework
of
the
so-called
zimmer
factors,
factors
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
professed
to
distill
from
this
court's
opinions.
the
court
of
appeals
performed
that
distillation
in
a
case
called
zimmer
against
mckeithen
before
washington
against
davis
was
decided,
and
they
were
obviously
--
the
zimmer
factors
were
intended
to
measure
the
discriminatory
effects
of
an
--
of
an
at-large
system.
the
district
court's
ultimate
conclusion
in
this
case
was
that
the
plaintiffs
had
met
their
burden
by
showing
an
aggregate
of
the
factors
catalogued
in
zimmer.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
a
very
short
per
curiam
opinion
without
hearing
argument
and
referring
merely
to
a
prior
decision
in
the
city
of
mobile's
case.
the
district
court's
remedy
for
the
constitutional
violation
it
found
was
to
create
five
districts,
two
of
which
are
preponderantly
black
in
population.
the
court
of
appeals
also
affirmed
this
remedy,
the
judgment
was
not
stayed,
elections
were
held
and
the
two
predominantly
black
districts
in
1978,
two
black
candidates
were
elected
to
the
board
and
now
sit.
i
am
not
going
to
dwell
this
morning
on
the
district
court's
zimmer
analysis
in
what
we
conceive
to
be
its
flaws
which
are
thoroughly
explored
in
our
briefs.
if
the
plaintiffs
continue
to
defend
that
analysis
either
as
it
was
actually
engaged
in
by
the
district
court
or
as
it
was
transmuted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
other
cases
into
the
equivalent
of
a
finding
of
purpose
rather
than
effect,
they
do
so
i
think
very
faintly
at
this
stage.
what
the
plaintiffs
essentially
rely
on
in
this
court
is
something
different,
a
passage,
one
passage
of
the
district
court's
opinion
that's
wholly
removed
from
the
analysis
on
which
it
purported
to
base
its
opinion.
that's
a
passage
in
which
the
court
does
indeed
talk
about
a
present
purpose
to
discriminate.
now
let
me
take
up
the
--
the
district
court's
opinion.
it
--
it
first
made
findings
of
fact
arranged
under
each
of
the
zimmer
headings.
these
are
at
pages
9
to
22
of
the
appendix.
and
then
it
turned
to
the
conclusions
of
law.
the
passage
on
which
the
plaintiffs
rely
appears
in
a
section
of
the
conclusions
of
law
where
the
court
was
dressed
--
addressing
itself
for
nine
pages
to
the
impact
of
washington
against
davis
in
vote
dilution
cases.
it
asked
whether
washington
against
davis
was
dispositive
of
this
case
so
as
to
preclude
application
of
the
zimmer
factors.
now,
at
page
34
it
--
it
made
a
comment
about
the
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
of
the
--
of
our
appendix,
34a
of
the
appendix.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
talked
about
a
present
purpose
to
dilute
the
black
vote.
now,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
finding
of
a
present
purpose
to
discriminate.
plaintiffs
have
tried
to
make
of
it
a
finding,
have
talked
even
about
the
two
court
rules
and
urged
deference
to
that
finding,
but
it
isn't
a
finding,
isn't
even
really
a
legal
conclusion,
the
sort
of
conjecture
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
at
the
best
and
really
more
likely
the
statement
of
a
--
of
a
discarded
alternative
legal
theory
for
deciding
the
case.
what
the
--
because
what
the
court
finally
says
down
near
the
bottom
of
page
34
is
that
more
basic
and
fundamental
than
any
of
the
above
approaches
is
that,
and
then
it
goes
on
and
i
suggest
says
that
washington
against
davis
established
no
new
purpose
test
so
far
as
voting
dilution
cases
are
concerned.
and
that
was
the
answer
to
the
question
that
it
posed
itself
at
the
beginning
of
this
part
of
its
opinion
and
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
h.
allen
we
have
the
--
the
city's
appendix,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
the
--
our
appendix.
mr.
william
h.
allen
34a
of
the
appendix.
i'm
very
sorry.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
--
sir
--
i
suggest,
your
honor,
what
i
--
what
i
was
--
the
point
i
sought
to
make
was
that
i
do
not
consider
that
a
--
i
do
consider
it
indeed.
it
is
a
statement
of
whatever
is
said
there.
it
is
not
i
suggest
a
finding
in
any
--
in
any
customary
sense
of
that.
he'd
made
his
findings
of
fact
elsewhere
and
--
and
he
really
had
not
addressed
himself
at
--
at
any
length
to
what
might
underlie
a
--
a
finding
of
a
--
in
--
current
intentional
state
inaction.
but
i
will
go
on
and
say
that
we
can
suppose
--
we
can
suppose
that
this
passage
really
did
mean
to
conclude
far
more
than
it
--
than
it
seems
to
have
on
its
--
on
--
on
its
face,
that
the
at-large
elections
involves
a
present
purpose
to
discriminate
through
state
inaction.
now
--
now
the
--
the
further
question
is
what
record
facts
are
there
that
might
support
such
a
conclusion.
the
court
mentioned
one
specific
fact
on
the
preceding
page
and
there
it
said
--
and
these
are
its
words
approximately,
whenever
a
redistricting
bill
of
any
type
is
proposed
by
a
member
of
the
mobile
county
legislative
delegation,
a
major
concern
is
centered
around
how
many
if
any
blacks
would
be
elected.
he
does
say
that.
now,
the
fact
is
that
in
spite
of
that
concern
--
in
spite
of
that
concern,
or
perhaps
even
because
of
it,
the
legislature
in
1975
did
enact
districting
legislation
for
the
mobile
county
school
system.
that
legislation
was
voided
on
the
suit
of
the
school
board
because
of
a
defect
in
notice
that
rendered
it
invalid
under
the
state
constitution.
now,
the
--
the
plaintiffs
met
to
seek
to
make
a
great
deal
of
this
invalidation.
i
think
what
they
would
have
this
court
rule
is
that
the
districting
legislation
and
its
invalidation
somehow
constitute
evidence
of
a
present
purpose
to
discriminate.
the
least
that
can
be
said
in
response
to
that,
your
honors,
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
so
treat
it
and
made
no
such
finding.
and
i
would
suggest
further
that
the
federal
judicial
inquiry
that
might
even
yield
such
a
finding
would
be
an
undertaking
of
extreme
delicacy.
i
submit
that
this
court
should
not
be
asked
to
make
the
sort
of
judgment
on
the
alabama
legislature
that
appellees
state
or
imply
on
the
basis
of
nothing
more
than
what
appears
in
this
record.
so
when
the
specifics
are
out
of
the
way
that
the
district
court
cited
and
if
we
forget
the
1975
enactment
that
on
its
face
looks
the
other
way,
what
we
have
at
the
very
most,
at
the
very
most
is
state
legislative
inaction
that
maintains
a
non-racially
motivated
at-large
voting
system
and
an
awareness
on
the
part
of
at
least
some
legislators
of
the
disparate
racial
effects
of
that
system.
now,
i
submit
that
to
make
a
finding
or
to
draw
a
conclusion
of
a
present
purpose
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
this
perpetuation
arguably
of
discriminatory
effects
through
inaction
is
exactly
--
is
exactly
what
this
court
rejected
last
term
in
personnel
administrator
against
feeney,
and
indeed
in
the
feeney
case
there
was
more
than
mere
inaction.
the
massachusetts
veterans
preference
law
had
been
amended
from
time
to
time
and
effectively
reenacted,
and
the
court
did
not
blink
at
saying
that
there
must
have
been
full
awareness
on
the
part
of
the
general
court
that
the
legislation
--
that
the
legislation
was
keeping
a
disproportionate
number
of
women
out
of
the
higher
levels
of
the
civil
service.
but
that
wasn't
enough.
that
wasn't
enough.
to
have
made
it
enough
would
have
undermined
the
rule
of
constitutional
law
with
which
the
court
began
its
analysis
in
feeney.
and
that
rule
stated,
even
in
the
paradigm
case
of
race,
that
is
what
the
court
said,
even
if
a
neutral
law
has
a
disproportionately
adverse
effect,
it
is
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause
only
if
that
impact
can
be
traced
to
a
discriminatory
purpose.
now,
let
me
stop
there
for
a
moment
and
just
say
a
word
about
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
the
companion
cases,
one
doesn't
know
what
the
court
meant
to
hold
in
our
case
because
its
--
its
opinion
is
not
at
all
revealing.
but
in
the
companion
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
imposes
the
same
purpose
requirement,
and
we
have
urged
in
our
briefs
--
i
will
not
--
i
will
not
expand
upon
the
points
now
but
i
think
they're
adequately
made
there
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
right
that
--
that
one
does
not
escape
the
problem
that
is
posed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
case
by
turning
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
would
say
--
i
was
just
about
to
turn
to
that,
your
honor,
and
i
would
say
further
two
things
under
the
voting
rights
act.
one,
the
argument
that's
made
here
is
made
most
belatedly.
to
be
sure
--
to
be
sure,
the
voting
rights
act
has
been
in
the
case.
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
has
been
in
the
case
from
the
beginning.
it
has
never
been
suggested
until
we
reached
this
court
that
it
might
have
a
different
content
from
the
--
from
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
what
the
government
says
in
its
amicus
brief
about
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act,
seems
to
me
the
capsule,
what
it
is
and
why
it
also
does
not
--
does
not
offer
a
way
out
of
--
of
what
may
be
the
problem
posed
by
this
case.
in
a
footnote
on
page
84
of
its
brief,
the
government
says
section
2
represents
congress'
rearticulation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
that
is
what
it
amounts
to.
the
--
that
the
standards
--
it
is
not
section
5.
it
does
not
read
the
same
way
as
section
5.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
government
does
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
oh,
i
understand
that
but
--
but
i
was
--
independently
of
what
the
government
says,
we
believe
that
--
that
the
legislative
history
does
indeed
show
that
all
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
well
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
--
i
will
answer
the
first
part
of
the
question.
i
say
i
think
the
issue
is
here.
whether
the
court
would
wish
to
remand
for
development
of
the
point
is
a
separate
subject
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
oh,
do
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
issue
here?
i
think
yes.
i
think
that
is
all
the
more
reason
for
--
for
a
remand
were
the
court
not
to
think
that
on
its
face
section
2
is
a
mere
restatement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
think
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
because
i
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
put
the
--
the
issue
aside.
i
think
it
would
also
be
fair,
i
mean,
i
happen
to
believe
on
the
merits
that
--
that
the
voting
acts
--
voting
act
meaning
issue
is
not
--
is
not
a
difficult
one
and
that
--
that
it
does
come
down
to
meaning
the
same
thing
as
whatever
your
honors
think
the
fifteenth
amendment
means.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
believe,
if
he
asked
me
to
make
that
assumption.
that
is
the
first
obstacle
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--
that
has
to
be
hurdled
in
getting
to
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act,
to
be
sure,
and
we
have
--
we
have
urged
in
the
--
in
our
reply
brief
at
some
length
why
it
should
not
be
read
as
creating
a
private
cause
of
action,
never
been
so
read
to
this
time
that
i'm
aware
of.
let
me
return
--
let
me
return
to
feeney
and
make
one
final
point
in
--
in
respect
to
that
--
that
opinion
as
it
bears
on
our
case.
the
court
there
spoke
of
the
impact
of
veterans'
preference
on
women
as
essentially
an
unavoidable
consequence
of
a
legislative
policy
that
has
always
been
deemed
to
be
legitimate.
so
far
as
the
legitimacy
of
state
policy
is
concerned,
if
veterans'
preference
is
a
legitimate
legislative
policy
then
surely
the
policy
of
at-large
municipal
elections,
the
policy
that
antedates
the
constitution
still
prevails
in
hundreds,
even
scores
of
communities
throughout
the
country,
is
a
legitimate
policy.
and
as
for
the
inevitability
of
the
adverse
consequences
of
pursuing
the
policy,
one
can
hope
--
one
can
hope
that
the
unfortunate
consequences
of
at-large
elections
are
not
unavoidable
or
inevitable
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
even
the
--
i
mean,
even
though
one
has
that
proof
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
even
though
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
does
not
add
up
to
the
constitutional
or
statutory
violation
that
that
--
on
which
this
case
is
based.
yes,
that
is
exactly
your
honor
--
our
point,
your
honor.
we
think
--
we
believe
that
that
--
that
is
the
beginning
point
of
analysis.
the
problem
arises,
somebody
gets
to
exercise
and
brings
a
lawsuit
when
he
--
when
he
sees
an
at-large
system
of
elections
and
what
can
be
termed
racial
--
racially
polarized
or
block
voting.
the
inquiry
proceeds
from
that
point,
the
inquiry
proceeds
from
that
point,
it
doesn't
end
there,
and
we
--
our
concern
here
is
that
the
--
that
we
think
the
district
court
essentially
ended
its
inquiry
there.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
--
all
i
can
say
in
answer
to
that,
your
--
your
honor,
is
that
if
there
were
indeed
the
basis
for
and
the
kind
of
finding
that
i
would
hope
this
court
would
insist
upon,
the
kind
of
record
that
this
--
i
hope
this
court
would
insist
upon
to
find
a
present
intent
of
the
--
of
a
legislature,
then
i
would
have
a
hard
time
distinguishing
that
case
from
the
case
in
which
the
--
the
statute
added
in
its
inception
was
racially
discriminatory.
mr.
william
h.
allen
thank
you
your
honor.
i
think
i
only
have
one
point
and
--
and
that
is
that
i
hope
it
is
not
we
who
are
being
accused
of
--
of
thinking
that
white
against
regester
represents
something
less
than
good
law.
the
--
the
fact
is
that
the
opening
of
the
analysis
in
white
against
regester
begins
this
way.
we
have
entertained
claims
that
multi-member
districts
are
being
used
invidiously
to
cancel
out
or
minimize
the
voting
strengths
of
racial
groups.
to
sustain
such
proof,
it
is
not
enough
that
the
racial
group
has
not
had
legislative
seats
in
proportion
to
its
voting
potential.
the
plaintiffs'
burden,
paraphrasing
now,
is
to
produce
evidence
that
would
support
findings
that
the
political
processes
leading
to
nomination
and
election
are
not
equally
open
to
participation
by
the
groups
in
question.
and
that
we
submit
is
what
was
lacking
from
the
proofs
offered
in
the
--
in
the
county
or
the
--
the
school
district's
case
here.
mr.
william
h.
allen
excuse
me?
i
think
it
--
i
think
that
what
was
--
that
the
circumstances
of
which
that
--
that
general
rule
was
applied
in
white
against
regester
was
the
equivalent
of
a
purpose
to
exclude
from
participation,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
would
have
a
--
i
would
have
a
tough
time
--
we'd
--
we
have
--
i
should
say
this
much
about
white
against
regester.
we
have
indeed
urged
although
that
the
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
then
you
have
not
affected
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--
the
discrimination.
that
is
quite
--
that's
quite
true.
one
would
have
to
find
that.
one
would
have
to
find
that
the
--
that
the
group
claiming
to
be
disadvantaged
was
indeed
disadvantaged,
to
be
sure.
but
where
all
one
has
--
where
all
one
has
is
the
block
voting
and
a
--
and
a
statute
neutral
in
its
inception
then
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
what
is
not
enough.
thank
you.
