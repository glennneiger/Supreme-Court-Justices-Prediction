mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
if
i
may
to
some
of
the
questions
concerning
the
commission
form
of
government
in
mobile.
briefly,
the
history
of
commission
government
mobile
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
began
in
1911.
the
original
statute
did
not
require
but
did
authorized
the
commissioners
once
they
were
elected
to
divide
up
the
executive
functions
among
themselves
and
it
certainly
was
the
practice
and
custom
in
mobile
almost
from
the
beginning
for
the
commissioners
to
do
this.
in
fact,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case
but
there
was
lawsuit
in
1920's
by
some
politicians
who
were
unhappy
that
commission
had
adopted
that
course
rather
than
act
in
this
as
a
board
of
directors
in
common.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that's
correct
and
in
1939,
pardon
my
understanding,
that
the
law
was
explicitly
changed
to
provide
for
one
place
to
be
the
mayor
in
advanced
to
the
election
and
the
two
associate
commissioners
would
be
assigned
to
executive
functions
after
the
election.
that
plan
also
run
on
some
technical
problems
in
the
alabama's
state
courts
and
it
ended
up
in
1965
for
the
first
time
of
the
executive
functions
of
the
three
commissioners
were
designated
by
law
before
they
run.
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
never
objected
to
the
retention
of
the
commission
form
of
government
which
permitted
the
use
of
single-member
districts.
it
was
a
position
of
the
defendant
city
in
this
case
form
the
time
it
filed
it's
answer
through
its
arguments
in
the
pretrial
motions,
the
pretrial
document,
pretrial
briefs
and
on
into
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
assignment
of
executive
functions
to
the
three
commissioners
foreclosed,
absolutely
foreclosed
any
remedy
in
this
case.
that
in
fact
was
i
think
a
key
stone
on
their
defense.
based
on
that
representations
which
can
also
be
found
by
the
way
in
their
answer
on
page
33
of
the
appendix,
that
in
order
for
single-member
districts
to
be
provided
in
mobile,
a
change
in
a
form
of
government
will
have
to
come
about
at
the
court
acting
in
its
equitable
discussion
when
it
was
forced
to
enter
an
order
of
its
own,
when
the
city
of
mobile
and
the
state
of
alabama
refused
after
the
court's
invitation
to
supply
some
legislative
response
to
the
infirmities
of
the
at-large
election
system.
then
the
court,
taking
the
advice
of
the
defendants
themselves
changed
to
an
optional
form
of
government
which
is
provided
in
the
state
of
alabama
by
other
statutes.
state
of
alabama
has
several
optional
forms
of
municipal
government
including
the
ancient
mayor-aldermanic
form
of
government
which
mobile
was
using
back
in
1900
including
a
new
mayor
council,
newer
mayor
council
form
that
was
devised
specifically
for
mobile
in
1963
and
including
a
special
legislation
that
governs
montgomery
for
example
and
birmingham
which
had
adopted
the
so-called
strong
mayor
that
everyone
in
this
trial
agreed
was
preferable
to
the
weak
mayor
where
the
council
could
interfere
in
the
day
to
day
business
of
the
executive.
but
to
repeat,
it
is
true
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
end
when
asked
proposed
a
remedy
suggested
a
change
to
a
mayor
council
only
because
the
defendants
were
urging
that
any
other
use
of
the
form
government
in
the
context
to
stay
along
with
districts
would
be
inequitable
and
inappropriate
in
mobile.
the
court's
remedy
list
open
at
the
state
alabama.
the
option
of
adopting
by
legislation,
a
commission
form
of
government
that
does
permit
of
the
use
of
single-member
districts,
that
is
still
open
to
alabama
if
it
wishes
to
use
it,
but
there
has
been
no
movement
on
the
part
of
anyone
in
the
legislature
or
in
city
government
to
seek
or
to
bring
about
such
change.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
city
took
the
position
from
the
beginning
that
it
locked,
entirely
locked
any
authority
to
change
it's
election
system
or
it's
form
of
government
and
that
in
fact
we
had
to
look
to
the
legislature
of
alabama
for
our
remedy.
and
it
--
it
filed
the
motion
to
strike
our
prayer
for
relief
that
the
election
system
be
changed
to
single-member
districts
because
they
lack
the
authority
to
provide
that
relief.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
not
exactly
mr.
justice
white.
we
do
not
take
position
that
voters
are
somehow
practicing
that
prohibited
--
constitutional
prohibited
form
of
discrimination
when
they
vote
long
racial
aims.
what
our
position
is
that
given
that
situation,
a
situation
by
the
way
which
has
been
reinforced
by
a
hundred
years
of
official
state
access
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that's
absolutely
correct.
in
--
in
mobile,
i
doubt
that
one
could
devise
an
electoral
form
that
more
carefully
and
distinctly
focused
the
electoral
power
of
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
polarized
voting,
we
do
not
even
say
that
every
at-large
system
under
those
circumstances
would
have
the
proscribed
effect.
after
all,
if
someone
here
pointed
out
there
were
in
a
true
at-large
system
and
a
true
at-large
system
as
in
this
case
that
the
top
three
vote
getters
would
be
elected
and
you
can
have
a
plurality
victories
and
it
made
then
that
under
such
a
system
blacks
in
mobile
representing
33%
of
the
population
would
have
had
the
clout
to
do
it.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
--
you
--
mr.
justice
white
you
are
correct
that
we
would
have
had
no
remedy
through
the
districting
formula
and
in
the
first
instance
we
think
that
it's
unrealistic
to
consider
such
a
possibility
sense
if
in
fact
blacks
and
whites
were
residentially
homogenized
throughout
the
entire
district,
it
is
unlikely
that
the
social
phenomenon
of
polarized
racial
voting
would
have
occurred
in
the
first
instance.
but
if
it
did
occur
in
that
circumstance
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
election
form
at-large
voting
would
not
be
the
specific
cause
of
the
delusion
of
their
vote
because
as
you
say
changing
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
changing
the
districts
would
not
provide
them
such
a
remedy
that
the
issue
of
course
is
not
presented
here,
the
evidence
was
and
the
court
found
that
mobile
one
of
the
most
racially
segregated
cities
in
the
country.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
yes,
sir.
that
was
a
factual
issue
that
was
debated
a
great
length
in
the
trial
court
and
all
of
the
facts
indicated
in
the
trial
court
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
its
90
that
it
was
only
one
--
it
was
an
indication
that
no
well-known,
well-financed
black
candidate
was
even
going
to
attempt
a
race
in
the
city
of
mobile
where
all
of
the
politicians
including
the
defendants
conceded
that
it
took
$30
to
$50,000.00
towards
a
successful
campaign.
when
all
of
the
black
politicians
including
the
floors,
non-partisan
voters
list
represented
to
the
court
that
they
would
not
even
attempt
to
launch
a
black
candidate
given
the
pattern
of
racially
polarized
voting.
this
was
a
situation
where
the
one
champion
of
black's
interest
in
the
city
of
mobile,
a
white
commissioner
name
joe
wagon
had
been
defeated
by
that
same
racially
polarized
voting.
his
situation
provided
the
centerpiece,
i
think
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
blacks
in
this
case
did
not
contend
that
they
had
a
right
to
have
a
districting
remedy
that
will
permit
them
elect
blacks.
they
wished
to
elect
a
candidate
of
their
choice.
they
weren't
--
their
evidence
indicated
that
they
were
not
even
permitted
by
the
way
of
majority
to
elect
a
white
candidate
who
was
at
all
connected
with
or
interested
in
their
concern.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
they
would
denied
that
right
by
the
block
voting
white
majority
operating
in
an
at-large
election
system
that
involved
the
majority
vote
requirement.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
there
is
no
such
constitutional
prohibition,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
certainly
do.
always
have.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that
is
the
position
we
take.
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
under
the
equal
protection
cause
of
action
such
a
find
of
intent
was
required
at
least
the
majority
opinion
did
and
although
it
did
sort
of
indicate
that
the
intent
would
not
be
required
under
a
fifteenth
--
well,
i'm
sorry,
the
majority
did
hold
as
well
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
would
require
a
showing
of
intent.
but
it
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
neither
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
certainly
not
the
voting
rights
act
requires
that
a
districting
system
which
operates
to
minimize
or
cancel
out
the
voting
strengths
of
a
protected
minority
requires
a
demonstration
that
that
electoral
system
was
motivated
in
the
first
instance
or
at
any
point
in
time
by
an
invidious
motive.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
your
honor,
the
governor
of
alabama
is
an
executive
function,
it
is
one
office.
he
must
run
statewide.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that's
correct
except
that
what
we
don't
foreclose
is
the
possibility
that
a
commission
system
could
have
been
retained
where
all
three
would
have
elected,
would
have
exercise
the
executive
power
and
still
have
been
elected
from
single
member
districts
and
without
validating
the
voting
rights
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
any
of
the
citizens
in
mobile
who
elected
them
from
single-member
districts.
we
say
that
that
certainly
is
an
option
which
is
used
in
other
the
cities,
has
not
been
challenged.
it
was
not
directly
challenged
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we're
not.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
it
is,
we
have
seen
that
the
constitution
requires
that
in
a
situation
where
there
is
block
voting
is
powerful
and
it's
rigid
as
there
is
in
mobile,
the
constitution
requires
that
an
electoral
system
be
provided
which
gives
blacks
an
opportunity
to
have
their
preferences
registered
in
the
election
system.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
and
their
preference
may
or
may
not
be
a
black
candidate.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
not
yet,
every
voter
doesn't
have
a
right
of
course
to
have
his
preference
registered
on
every
occasion,
but
the
concept
of
delusion
grew
out
of
this
court's
one
person,
one
vote,
one
occasion.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
mathematical
concept
of
one
person
at
one
vote
is
not.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that
is
--
that
is
not
with
fortson
versus
dorsey
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
specific
concept
in
reynolds
was
a
mathematical
concept.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
but
the
language
of
reynolds
is
much
broader
than
that,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
it
talks
about
the
right
of
every
american
citizen
to
have
a
full
undiluted,
equally
weighted
vote
and
from
the
beginning
of
that
line
cases,
this
court
has
recognized.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
has
recognized
then
in
laying
down
the
rule
that
such
a
delusion
or
debasement
of
a
person's
vote
could
occur
by
a
geographical
apportionment
scheme
by
mathematics
as
you
say.
then
in
providing
a
remedy
for
that,
a
local
government
could
go
to
an
at-large
election
scheme.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that
is
our
position.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
if
the
system
operated
given
all
of
the
premises
of
the
hypothetical
question
that
there
was
rigid
polarized
voting
which
strictly
precluded
on
every
occasion
consistently
over
a
period
of
time
the
preferences
of
the
15%
black
minority
from
being
registered
in
the
at-large
system
then
it
would
be
functionally
no
different
than
a
districting
system
in
which
blacks
were
in
one
district
that
had
no
representatives
and
the
whites
were
in
one
district
that
had
all
of
the
representatives.
that's
our
position.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
don't
attempt
to
make
that
argument
here
mr.
justice
white
but
the
argument
might
be
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
argument
might
be
made
under
the
presence
this
court
has
established
if
it
could
be
shown
by
catholics
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
our
experience
it
has
not
been
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
possible
to
show
this
that
catholics
consistently
voted
as
a
black
that
or
rather
that
the
majority
of
non-catholics
voted
as
a
black
to
defeat
catholic
candidates
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
well,
whether
or
not
to
the
case
applies
to
the
catholics
or
poles
or
other
groups
is
a
questions
was
simply
or
course
requires
additional
consideration
of
other
factors
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
passed
primarily
to
protect
the
voting
rights
of
blacks.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
mr.
chief
justice
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
in
the
record
where
blacks
had
run
in
the
city
of
mobile
for
other
government
such
as
the
school
board,
the
legislature
had
attempted
time
and
again
to
seek
election
and
have
been
defeated
by
a
solid
black
vote
by
the
majority
of
whites.
as
well
as
other
white
candidates
both
in
the
city
commission
elections
and
in
school
board
elections.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
case
or
controversy
is
between
the
plaintiff
class
of
black
citizens
of
mobile
and
the
state
of
alabama
operating
through
its
agency,
the
state
of
mobile.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
case
in
controversy
involves
the
law
from
this
in
the
constitutionality
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
evidence
was
that
they
have
frequently
run
in
the
past,
have
expressed
the
desire
to
run
in
the
future.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
john
leflore
for
one,
run
for
the
state
legislature
as
soon
as
the
federal
court
in
montgomery
provided
single-member
districts
that
provided
him
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
elected.
may
it
please
the
court
i
would
like
to
pint
out
that
contrary
to
mr.
rhyne's
opening
statement
that
this
case
is
strictly
an
equally
protection
case,
that
there
are
at
least
four
independent
legal
theories
supporting
a
judgment
below.
the
court
is
confronted
with
the
findings
effect
the
two
courts
below
that
mobile
are
at-large
election
system
has
not
only
the
effect
but
the
purpose,
the
motive
of
discriminating
against
black
voters.
based
on
these
findings,
this
court
can
affirm
the
judgments
below
first
on
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
which
explicitly
prohibits
any
election
laws
which
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
abridging
blacks
voting
rights.
secondly,
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
cause
of
action
drawing
out
of
white
versus
regester,
whitcomb
versus
chavis,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court's
stop
in
their
monetarily
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
even
stronger
and
all
the
critical
aspects
than
was
the
evidence
in
white
versus
regester.
thirdly,
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
any
state
law
that
is
supported
by
a
racial
--
invidious
racial
motive;
and
fourth,
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
provides
and
proscribes
any
state
law
which
has
either
the
purpose
or
effect
of
abridging
the
voting
rights
of
the
blacks.
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
your
honor,
we
simply
don't
take
a
position
on
whether
or
not
republicans
are
protected.
i
am
thinking
about
that
question.
it
certainly
occurs
to
me
first
of
all
that
the
political
parties
are
vehicles
that
we
have
in
this
society
adopted
as
a
convenient
means
of
carrying
on
the
political
dialogue
itself.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
they
voted
as
blocks,
that
is
correct
but
the
question
is
whether
they
--
whether
the
vote
against
them
is
invidious
in
nature.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
no,
sir,
certainty
not
on
its
face.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i'm
saying
--
i'm
trying
to
avoid
taking
a
position
one
way
of
the
other
simply
because
it
involves
clearly
different
kind
of
issues
which
requires
thorough
exploration.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
it
would
be
different
if
it
showed
that
the
block
voting
was
on
the
basis
of
the
ideals
and
the
positions,
ideologies
espoused
by
this
particular
organization
which
cross
the
racial
lines.
the
constitution
forbids
invidious
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
voting
rights
act
forbids
invidious
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
of
this
country
to
vote
in
a
block
fashion
of
course.
the
question
is
whether
the
state
can
reinforce
and
guarantee
the
defeat
of
the
minority
through
a
particular
election
form
which
is
what
they
have
done
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
don't
--
there's
been
very
little
that
we've
agreed
upon
it
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
--
i
would
like
to
close
by
pointing
out
that
after
the
white
and
whitcomb
cases
and
the
voting
rights
act
may
have
been
analyzed
to
death
that
the
issue
from
my
client
standpoint
very
simply
is
whether
or
not
they
will
be
permitted
to
enter
at
last
the
mainstream
of
politics
in
the
city
of
mobile?
if
this
court
stands
by
it's
prior
precedents
and
white
and
whitcomb,
if
it
observes
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
voting
rights
act,
if
it
observes
precedent
it
established
in
gomillion
versus
lightfoot
and
arlington
heights
regarding
a
racially
motivated
state
law,
then
given
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
two
concurrent
courts
below
the
judgments
below
must
be
affirmed.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
what
the
--
the
argument,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
argument
that
the
court
is
rejecting
here
is
the
argument
that
the
defendant
city
depended
upon
throughout
trial
and
that
is
that
plaintiffs
had
to
show
intent
in
the
origination,
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
you'll
notice
that
court
says
that
washington
versus
davis
did
not
establish
a
new
supreme
court
purpose
test
that
requires
initial
discriminatory
intent.
the
preceding
paragraph
contains
the
finding
that
there
is
a
current
condition
of
the
delusion
of
the
black
vote
resulting
from
intentional
state
legislative
in
action.
now
we
fought
for
the
lower
courts
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
this
argument
that
if
we
couldn't
prove
that
in
1911,
there
was
racial
motive
involved
then
we
we're
out
of
court
and
that
issue
that
district
court
was
addressing
in
that
passage.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
really
only
two
issues
that
this
court
must
address
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
the
case
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
statute,
the
voting
rights
act,
or
whether
it
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
constitution.
and
the
second
issue
is
whether
this
court
will
affirm
and
leave
undisturbed
the
findings
of
two
courts
below
that
the
at-large
election
system
in
mobile,
alabama
is
maintained
for
invidiously
discriminatory
reasons.
we
believe
that
particularly
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
last
term,
cannon
versus
university
of
chicago
in
particular,
that
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
inescapable.
under
the
facts
of
cort
versus
ash,
there
is
virtually
no
difference
between
the
application
of
that
case
to
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
title
9
of
the
education
amendments.
that
has
been
briefed
and
i
will
not
go
to
--
into
it
in
further
detail.
with
respect
to
the
findings
of
fact
that
there
is
an
invidious
purpose
in
the
maintenance
of
this
election
system,
we
believe,
as
we
have
said
in
the
supplemental
brief,
that
columbus
and
dayton
and
indeed,
personnel
administrator
of
massachusetts
against
feeney,
virtually
require
this
court,
following
the
same
principles,
to
affirm
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
at-large
election
system
first
put
into
effect
in
1911
has
not
been
changed,
notwithstanding
attempts
to
do
so,
because
of,
not
in
spite
of
but
because
of,
the
knowledge
that
the
at-large
system
prevents
blacks
from
having
their
electoral
choices
registered
in
the
election
process.
now,
with
respect
to
the
remedy
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we're
talking
about
the
legislators'
intent.
we
believe
if
we
correctly
read
washington
versus
davis
and
arlington
versus
metropolitan
housing
authority,
if
we
correctly
read
--
read
those
cases
we
are
talking
about
the
lawmakers'
intent
if
we
are
investigating
the
question
of
invidious
purpose
behind
particular
legislation.
if
we
are
talking
about
the
intent
of
the
people
who
operate
the
statute
then
we've
got
what
i
suppose
would
be
a
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
type
of
--
of
case
in
--
in
which
case
we
would
shift
our
gaze
to
the
--
and
scrutiny
to
the
actions
of
the
--
of
the
people
who
were
actually
operating
the
election
system.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
and
not
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
question
has
to
be
answered
in
the
context
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
this
court
first
must
look
to
the
question
whether
or
not
the
judgments
below
must
be
sustained
on
the
basis
of
the
voting
rights
act,
which
specifically
addresses
race
or
the
fifteenth
amendment
in
the
cases
decided
under
it.
i
believe
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
it's
important
to
recall
that
the
dilution
principle
did
not
derive
constitutionally
from
the
principle
of
one
person,
one
vote.
racial
abridgement
--
the
abridgment
of
voting
rights
on
the
basis
of
race
did
not
derive
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
principles
of
a
full
and
effective
vote
in
one
person,
one
vote.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
it
derived
from
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
statutes
enacted
under
it.
what
i
wanted
to
point
out
was
that
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
this
court
had
to
look
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
to
the
cases
decided
under
it,
specifically
lane
versus
william
--
wilson,
gomillion
versus
lightfoot,
brown
versus
the
board,
to
find
in
the
equal
protection
clause
a
principle
that
says
that
there
is
a
full
and
effective
vote
for
other
classes
of
people.
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
analogy
or
that
juxtaposition
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
fourteenth
that
there
was
ever
developed
a
one
person,
one
vote
principle.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
--
that
the
--
the
fundamental
disagreement
that
justice
stewart
had
with
the
reynolds
case
all
through
the
years
has
been
that
it
was
too
simplistic,
sixth
grade
arithmetic.
and
did
not
take
into
account
the
realities
of
the
political
process
to
which
the
constitution
must
address
itself.
for
example,
and
i
--
i
cite
--
i
quote
here,
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
momentarily
from
--
from
justice
stewart's
dissent
in
lucas
versus
the
colorado
assembly.
"i
could
not
join
in
the
fabrication
of
a
constitutional
mandate
which
imports
and
forever
freezes
one
theory
of
political
thought
into
our
constitution
and
denies
to
every
state
any
opportunity
for
enlightened
and
progressive
innovation
in
the
design
of
its
democratic
institutions
so
as
to
accommodate
within
a
system
of
representative
government
the
interests
and
aspirations
of
diverse
groups
of
people
without
subjecting
any
group
or
class
to
absolute
domination
by
geographically
concentrated
or
highly
organized
majority."
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
believe
it
does
justice
stewart
because
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
confess
that
in
that
--
in
that
particular
decision,
your
attention
was
directed
to
the
prerogatives
of
the
state
legislature
not
to
what
the
constitution
requires.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
you
said
the
constitution
did
not
require
the
imposition
of
strict
population,
that
one
person
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
believe
the
constitution
does
require
that
the
right
of
persons
to
vote
not
be
abridged
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that
much
we
know.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
this
case
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendments
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
below.
and
we
relied
from
the
beginning
on
the
voting
rights
act
which
was
discussed
earlier
as
another
statutory
as
the
first
cause
of
action
that
the
court
ought
to
approach
which
of
course
is
decided
under
the
enforcement
provision
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that
is
section
5
of
the
act.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
rely
on
section
2,
which
is
the
general
provision
of
the
voting
rights
act
which
extends
substantive
rights
to
voters.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
believe
that
it
does.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
it
does
not
explicitly
do
so
any
more
than
title
9
of
the
education
amendments
did.
but
all
of
the
elements
including
an
expression
of
understanding
on
the
part
of
the
congress
that
it
does
confer
a
private
cause
of
action
on
private
individuals
as
expressed
in
debates
on
the
floor,
as
expressed
in
the
--
in
the
enactment
of
a
--
an
attorney's
fee
provision.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
in
its
motion
to
dismiss
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
--
early
in
the
case,
it
held
that
we
did
have
a
cause
of
action.
when
it
wrote,
at
the
end
of
the
case,
it
did
not
even
address
this
--
the
--
the
voting
rights
act
issue.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
in
a
footnote
it
said,
we're
going
to
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
anyway
because
we
are
--
we've
got
nevett
versus
sides
with
us
today.
and
so
we're
not
going
to
--
to
go
into
the
knotty
--
what
we
see
as
a
knotty
question
of
whether
there's
a
private
cause
of
action
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
there's
a
possibility.
in
the
--
in
the
beazer
case
last
term,
the
possibility
of
remanding
it
was
objected
and
the
court
went
ahead
and
reached
the
statutory
issue
first
at
--
at
this
juncture.
and
we
believe
that
since
what
we
are
talking
about
is
not
a
review
of
the
factual
circumstances
in
light
of
the
statutory
standards,
that
it
makes
little
sense
for
this
court
to
remand
which
is
essentially
a
legal
question.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
from
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
oh,
what
we're
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
was
responding
to
justice
rehnquist
in
this
vein,
we
have
understood
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
it
was
and
we
rely
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
certainly
believe
they
could,
if
they
can
show
that
they've
been
treated
the
way
the
black
folks
have
been
treated
in
mobile.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that
would
be
our
understanding
of
the
reynolds
principle
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
and
i
confess
i
got
into
it
a
little
bit
obliquely
is
this.
we
understand
the
argument
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
to
be
that
if
this
court
determines
that
the
election
system
in
mobile
satisfies
the
one
person,
one
vote
principle,
you
ought
to
let
it
alone.
that
there
ought
not
be
any
further
federal
inquiry
or
intervention
into
the
actual
workings
of
the
political
process
to
determine
whether
or
not
blacks'
rights
are
nevertheless
being
abridged.
and
i
am
simply
pointing
out
that
that's
letting
the
tail
wag
the
constitutional
dog.
that
if
--
if
there
is
a
one
person,
one
vote
principle
it
is
because
the
constitution
spoke
first
to
the
equal
rights
and
to
the
voting
rights
of
black
people.
and
whatever
--
whatever
rights
other
groups
may
have
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
principles
developed
under
reynolds,
surely
the
important
rights
of
blacks
which
the
civil
war
amendment
was
designed
to
protect
cannot
be
forgotten
in
the
shuffle.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
no,
sir,
because
the
governor
is
one
office
and
it
is
not
a
representative
office
in
the
nature
of
a
legislature
or
one
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
well
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
are
not
attacking
majority
rule.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
approximately
between
--
approximately
30%
of
the
--
or
35%.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
there
has
never
been
a
black
governor.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
say
it
does
not.
as
i
say,
it
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
--
of
the
body
that
we're
talking
about.
where
more
than
one
person
is
elected
for
the
purpose
of
representing
diverse
interests
in
the
community,
as
in
--
to
use
your
language,
there
--
there
would
be
no
need
to
have
three
commissioners
for
the
city
commission.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
he
does
by
virtue
of
statute.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
at
one
time
before
1965
there
was
not
a
statutory
requirement
that
they
divide
up
those
duties.
that
was
something
that
was
put
into
the
law
in
1965.
it's
something
by
the
way
that
the
1979
bill
that
mr.
rhyne
was
talking
about
would
have
taken
out.
it
would
have
allowed
the
commission
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
it
is
true
now.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
three
commissioners
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
--
and
the
mayor.
the
mayor
is
the
nominal
chief
executive
of
the
--
of
the
city
and
that's
a
rotating
position
among
the
three
commissioners.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
they
do
--
they
have
the
executive
power.
they
had
the
legislative
power.
they
had
the
administrative
power
and
to
some
extent
the
judicial
power.
although
we
have
a
municipal
court
that
exercises
most
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
city.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
need
to
distinguish
those
executive
functions,
chief
justice
burger.
i
believe
that
with
respect
to
the
executive
functions
there's
no
reason
to
say
that
blacks
must
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
elect
a
person
in
every
executive
office
or
every
executive
department.
what
they
do
or
what
they
are
entitled
to
is
a
right
to
share
fairly
and
effectively
in
the
administrative
and
legislative
group
determinations
that
government
carries
out
in
mobile.
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
latest
--
the
latest
turnout
figures
that
we
were
able
to
come
up
with
would
indicate
that
black
voter
registration
was
around
65%
and
that
black
turnout
was
something
like
--
well,
is
about
the
same
as
whites
in
--
in
elections
where
there
were
black
candidates
and
less
than
whites.
and
when
it
was
a
good
as
the
white
turnout
it
was
around
36-40%.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
not
in
the
city.
that
--
that
was
a
fact
that
the
court
found
for
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
although
it
was
not
cast
in
those
terms,
the
court's
language
can
be
read
to
include
that
implication
which
was
discussed
during
the
trial.
and
that
--
i
think
the
court
says
there's
no
reasonable
opportunity
for
blacks
to
have
their
choices
elected
in
the
at-large
system.
it
is
not
necessary,
however,
and
the
court
did
not
rule
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
it
has
to.
blacks
are
35%
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
--
of
the
population
of
--
of
mobile.
they
are
less
than
that
of
the
voting
age
population
of
mobile.
i
think
it
is
closer
to
--
to
30%
or
32%.
and
if
they
were
registered
at
the
same
rate
as
--
as
whites
they
would
still
be
a
political
minority
in
the
community
by
a
substantial
margin.they
are
not
close
to
being
a
majority.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
there
--
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
was
not
polarization
of
electoral
processes
along
religious
lines
or
along
ethnic
lines
in
mobile,
alabama.
that
the
only
discernible
polarization
from
a
social
standpoint
was
along
the
lines
of
race.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
was
asked
that
--
that
question
i
believe
at
the
first
argument,
justice
stevens,
and
my
reply
would
be
the
same.
i
--
i
believe
that
--
that
political
groups
probably
would
be
protected.
although
i
think
there's
a
difference
in
that
--
as
i've
--
as
i've
said
before,
i
think
politics
is
the
--
the
vehicle
or
the
forum
through
which
we
operate
the
political
process.
that
it
is
a
--
a
volitional
choice
which
party
you
are
in,
and
that
may
cause
some
differences,
differences
which
i
simply
have
not
explored
and
which
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
at
this
point.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
certainly
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
believe
that
the
city
can
draw
their
district
lines
anywhere
that
they
fairly
choose
so
long
as
it
cannot
be
demonstrated
that
the
particular
ethnic
or
political
group
you're
talking
about
has
not
--
has
been
systematically
excluded
from
the
political
process.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
oh,
no,
they
have
--
mobile
is
growingly
republican.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
believe
that
it's
possible
to
if
you
can
show
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
well,
i
believe
that
--
that
we
have
to
refer
back
to
white
versus
regester
for
the
realm
of
possibilities.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
as
i
just
said,
i
may
or
i
may
--
i
don't
know
the
difference
--
whether
the
difference
in
political
concerns
makes
the
kind
of
difference
that
--
that
distinguish
it
from
ethnic
or
religious
or
in
this
case
racial
classifications,
and
i'm
just
not
prepared
to
--
to
take
a
final
position
on
that,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
well,
the
thrust
of
my
argument
today
has
been
that
i
think
that
the
voting
rights
and
--
the
voting
rights
act
and
fifteenth
amendment
arguments
are
clearly
the
strongest
because
of
their
constitutional
mandate.
because
--
because
we're
not
dealing
with
a
--
a
political
theory
that
we
are
inventing
out
of
whole
cloth,
we
are
dealing
with
constitutional
commands.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
question
if
you
affirm
the
findings
of
purpose
below.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
assume
what,
may
it
please
the
court?
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
do
not
assume
that
there's
purpose
rather
than
effect.
we
--
we
think
we've
proved
it.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
we
would.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
would
like
to
--
to
leave
by
referring
again
to
white
versus
regester
because
the
facts
in
this
case
were
so
much
stronger
than
those
in
white
with
respect
to
showing
that
there
was
a
systematic
denial
and
abridgement
and
submergence
of
the
black
voting
rights
and
interests
in
mobile,
alabama
than
there
were
in
dallas
and
bexar
county
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
it
was
the
state
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
the
state
legislature.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
but
the
principle
of
white
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that's
correct.
we
wouldn't
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
i
--
i
would
mention
it.
i
would
say
that
i
think
that
the
issue
is
foreclosed
by
some
earlier
opinions.
and
i
think
allen
versus
state
board
of
elections,
perkins
versus
matthews,
city
of
petersburg,
city
of
richmond,
beer
against
united
states,
united
states
versus
sheffield
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
they
were
all
--
all
of
the
cases
i
cited
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
--
were
voting
rights
cases
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
which
recognized
that
dilution
was
a
wrong
for
which
there
was
a
federal
remedy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
avery
versus
middle
--
midland
county
extended
the
one
person,
one
vote
principle
to
the
local
level
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
and
that
was
what
justice
stewart
was
i
think
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
--
getting
to.
where
--
mr.
j.
u.
blacksher
where
is
the
constitutional
precedent
for
extending
dilution
or
white
versus
regester
to
the
local
level?
and
that
gets
back
i
guess
to
what
i
was
saying
earlier.
if
--
how
can
you
extend
one
person-one
vote
to
the
local
level
and
say
that
it's
a
--
a
more
fundamental
principle
than
the
right
of
blacks
not
to
have
their
voting
rights
abridged
which
is
what
the
constitutional
mandate
is
in
the
beginning
--
in
the
first
place.
thank
you.
