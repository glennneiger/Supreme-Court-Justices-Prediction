mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes
sir.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
and
pretty
much
undisputed.
i'll
go
over
them
briefly
and
we
will
launch
into,
all
the
multi-faceted
issues
that
this
case
ultimately
presents.
jacque
hunter
and
a
codefendant
were
convicted
on
guilty
pleas
--
a
burglary
charge
then
in
terrell
superior
court
then
in
south
georgia
near
albany.
they
were
each
sentenced
of
the
two
years
probated,
provided
that
they
each
paid
fines
and
costs
and
attorney's
fees
that
amounted
to
some
$250.00.
codefendant's
family
was
there
in
court.
he
paid
the
fine
reasonable
promptly
or
they
paid
the
fine,
it's
not
clear
or
even
relevant
i
guess
who.
but
in
any
event,
he
was
released.
jacque
hunter,
when
the
court
--
the
trial
judge
inquired
of
her
whether
she
could
pay
a
fine,
had
indicated
to
her
that
she
thought
to
him,
that
she
thought
so,
and
named
two
cousins
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
she
said,
“yes,
sir,”
but
i
don't
think
i'm
mischaracterizing
it
to
put
it
that
way,
i
think
that
this
is
a
--
i
think
this
whole
episode
has
to
be
viewed
as
a
typical
one
and
that
is
when
a
defendant
is
appearing
for
pronouncement
of
sentence.
i
think
always,
his
hopes
outrun
his
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
sir,
she
didn't.
but,
i
think
the
gist
of
them
are
that,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
important
either.
but,
in
any
event,
she
did
indicate
that
she
could
pay
a
fine.
when
the
judge
inquired
further,
she
named
two
cousins
that
she
was
going
to
look
to,
to
pay
the
fine.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no,
sir,
there
was
no
explanation
was
ever
tendered
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
but
of
course,
it's
not
a
dispute
that
they
did
not
pay
the
fine
or
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
sir,
they
had
--
subsequently,
ten
months
after
this
sentence
was
--
i
mean
ten
weeks
after
the
sentence
was
passed
and
it
became
apparent
that
her
hopes
or
expectation
of
whatever
they
were,
were
not
going
to
come
to
pass.
she
sued
out
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
terrell
superior
court
with
volunteer
counsel.
ironically,
the
hearing
occurred
before
the
same
–
before
the
trial
judge
which
is
not
normally
--
it
would
simply
be
a
coincidence
on
georgia
law.
also
coincidentally,
it
occurred
within
the
term
of
court
when
he
still
had
plenary
power
over
the
sentence
in
all
respects.
but
in
any
event
at
that
particular
hearing,
which
i
don't
believe
is
part
of
the
record
before
this
court,
there
was
no
testimony
taken.
the
parties
just
simply
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
she
was
in
jail
because
she
had
no
money.
there
was
no
detailed
explanation
made
at
that
time.
no
inquiry
even
made
at
that
time
as
to
why
the
cousins
hadn't
paid
or
even
what
basis
she
had
had
for
making
that
original
statement.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
but
in
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
sir,
that's
not
correct.
i
think
that
this
might
be
a
misimpression
that
inadvertently
arouse
from
one
of
the
state's
arguments,
that
is
the
fine
is
somehow
stake.
it's
not
a
stake
in
a
positive
sense
because
the
fine
once
paid
is
lost,
even
successful
completion
of
probation,
even
if
she
had
been
discharged
as
a
model
citizen
after
one
year
wouldn't
have
resulted
in
that
money
being
refunded.
to
this
degree,
it
does
represent
--
there
is
an
added
risk.
i
might
add
here
that
an
affluent
defendant
faces,
when
he
pays
the
fine
immediately
and
hits
the
street.
if
jacque
hunter
for
example,
had
been
given
leave
to
pay
in
installments
and
had
validated
her
probation
after
two
weeks,
the
relative
amount
of
money
she
would
lose
would
be
--
she
would
have
lost
the
$250.00,
probably
just
only
a
small
part
out
of
it.
but
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
your
honor,
that
obviously
is
a
question
that
arises
out
of
this
but
it's
not
our
case.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
it's
not
our
case.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
having
been
afforded
a
fair
opportunity
to
pay
the
fine
in
installments
that
her
probation
could
be
revoked
if
she
failed
to
do
it.
now,
obviously
we're
talking
about
a
gray
area.
there's
very
large
gray
area
here
because
it's
obviously
a
very
easy
question
if
she
willfully
fails
to
pay
the
fine
if
she
had
squandered
a
fair
opportunity
to
make
installment
payments.
it's
quite
another
--
it's
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
if
she
goes
out
and
pounce
every
door
in
the
county
looking
for
a
job
and
she
can't
get
one.
but,
i
think
that
particular
kind
of
question
is
probably
going
to
be
buried
in
the
proper
use
of
the
court's
discretion
when
it's
faced
with
ratification
petition
if
one
has
ever
filed
on
that
particular
ground.
and
indeed,
your
honor,
one
may
not
ever
be
filed
on
that
particular
ground
because
our
probation
officer
may
understand
what
effort
she
is
making
and
simply
not
prefer
those
kind
of
charges.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
if
i
fully
understand
what
you
mean
your
honor,
if
you
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think.
and
i
think
that's
fair
characterization
of
what
happened
here
according
to
the
view
of
the
state
takes.
but,
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
grounds
--
i
think
she'd
have
the
same
kind
of
claim.
the
question,
which
would
be
before
the
court
on
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
whether
she
is
being
confined
essentially
for
failure
to
pay
money.
and
i
think
once
you've
got
that,
you
enter
into
an
equal
--
the
full
panoply
of
equal
protection
considerations
arises.
but
let
me
run
back
just
a
minute
to
a
question
that
you
asked.
we
were
talking
about
the
gray
area.
there
--
what
i
want
to
avoid
is
the
impression.
there's
no
part
of
my
argument
that
says
that
jacque
hunter
can't
be
locked
up
if
she
can't
pay
the
fine.
obviously
if
it
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
because
obviously,
if
we
did
anything
else,
we
would
immunize
jacque
hunter
possibly
from
any
punishment
and
that's
not
our
claim.
we
don't
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
a
proper
inquiry
would
involve
that
your
honor.
that
certainly
--
if
the
judge
is
thinking
in
terms
of
a
fine
at
all,
as
a
precondition
or
a
condition
or
probation
or
anything,
in
common
sense
says
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i
think
you've
got
the
same
case
we
got
here,
we've
got
an
equal
protection
problem.
now
your
honor,
we
got
that
particular
kind
of
case
here.
i
mean,
we
got
--
we
would
have
that
particular
kind
of
case
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave.
simply
because
in
that
case,
as
in
this
case,
based
on
that
colloquy,
we
would
have
the
poverty
factor,
the
precondition
payment
isolated
and
highlighted
as
the
sole
feature
on
which
liberty
or
not
turns.
that's
a
unique
feature
of
this
case.
it's
not
going
to
exist
in
a
normal
case.
in
a
normal
case,
when
a
judge
is
passing
sentence,
and
incidentally,
i
want
to
stress
too
that
we're
not
making
any
suggestion
at
all
that
the
judge
should
not
consider
or
should
not
be
aware
of
economic
status.
it's
our
position
that
the
more
he
knows
about
that
infinite,
the
wiser
and
the
better
his
judgment
can
be.
but
he's
got
to
treat
that
factor
like
raise
as
justice
jackson
said
in
edwards
versus
california
as
a
neutral
fact,
one
that
is
neither
the
source
of
rights
nor
a
basis
for
denying
them.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
she
would
have
the
same
equal
protection
claim,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well
now
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
you're
hitting
what
--
i
suppose
we're
talking
about
--
were
are
not
--
if
you've
got
a
--
if
a
judge
is
faced
with
two
comparably
situated
codefendants,
one
is
rich
and
one
is
poor,
there's
no
requirement
that
he
impose
the
same
sentences.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
all
probability,
the
sentence
is
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
it's
a
question.
here
we're
getting
into
a
question
of
--
it's
a
different
question
here.
the
judge
may
very
well
decide
that
a
thousand
dollar
fine
would
be
sufficient
to
punish
the
relatively
affluent
defendant.
he
may
decide
that
a
fine,
you
know,
that
--
the
poor
codefendant
who
can
pay
no
fine
should
also
be
punished
but
obviously,
perhaps
there
are
difficulties
in
punishing
though
a
fine
or
him
through
a
fine.
and
therefore,
he
could
impose
a
term,
you
know,
obviously,
if
it's
ten
days,
it's
a
very
simple
question.
if
we
got
this
case
here
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i
think
that
illustrates,
i
think
that
illustrates
how
poverty
has
to
be
--
how
it
can
be
considered,
how
it
has
to
be
considered
in
molding
whatever
the
appropriate
punishment
is.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
sir,
obviously,
you've
got
a
problem.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
you've
got
the
same
problem
that
we've
got
here,
i
think
in
that
situation.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
but
what
--
you
were
talking
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
we're
talking
about
the
question
of
degrees,
i
think
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
post,
we've
got
a
judge
who's
looking
to
a
codefendants,
he
wants
to
punish
him,
say
comparably,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
can
come
in
and
claim,
“hey,
wait
a
minute
now.
a
real
comparable
punishment
would
have
been
to
lock
him
up
for
one
day,
not
ten,
or
for
two
years
not."
you
know,
i
mean
you
get
into
a
question
where
you're
quibbling
with
considerations
that
only
a
trial
judge
can
make.
now,
again,
anytime
the
problem
with
posing
hypothetical
is
that
any
hypothetical
you
give,
it's
easy
to
isolate
economic
factor
in
a
way
that's
similar,
to
the
way
it's
isolated
here.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
in
a
way
he
did,
but
again,
the
thousand
dollar
fine
for
onasis
and
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
--
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
you
can
ever
put
her
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
we
get
back
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
there
may
be
a
point
when
she
is
exposed
to
jail
because
for
indigence,
you
know,
talking
about,
not
the
gray
area,
the
black
or
white
where
she
willfully
fails
to
get
a
job
and
the
make
the
payments.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
can,
if
it's
treated
as
a
neutral
fact,
if
it
goes
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
sir,
it
wasn't.
indigency
was
made
the
sole
condition
on
which
your
going
to
jail
and
staying
free
a
turn
or
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
sometimes
it
can
be.
but
it
the
normal
case,
we'll
never
know.
because
in
a
normal
case
of
whatever
judgment
is
passed,
it's
going
to
be
weighed
and
balanced
against
the
multitude
of
factors
and
we'll
never
be
able
to
go
into
that
even
a
question
of
proof
aside.
we
would
never
be
able
to
go
into
that
and
say,
“this
man
got
this
particular
sentence
because
he
was
black
or
poor
or
rich
or
had
blue
eyes,”
or
something
like
that.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
sir,
that
obviously
is
a
common
situation,
there
is
something
quite
right
with
that.
what
is
right
with
that
is
that
the
judge
has
used
that
economic
factor
rationally,
obviously,
it's
very
rational
and
hypothetical
you
gave.
that's
the
problem
essentially
with
the
use
of
it
here.
the
state
justifies
the
use
of
this
exclusion
for
poverty.
for
one,
well,
basically,
for
a
multitude
of
reasons.
they
say,
this
reflects
the
family
support
and
reflects
their
control.
it
reflects
an
ability
to
live
without,
you
know,
without
creating
further
offenses.
that's
where
their
argument
i
think
basically
fails
against
the
traditional
test
of
showing
a
rational
connection.
they
have
used,
they've
taken
a
fine
and
they've
used
it
here
as
a
blunderbuss.
instead
of
making
the
specific
inquiries
in
what
control
is
the
family
going
to
offer,
what
kind
of
support
are
they're
going
to
give.
is
she
going
to
be
able
to
live
alike
without
crime?
they've
taken
one
factor,
whether
she
can
pay
a
certain
fine,
period.
and
they've
used
it
as
a
substitute,
as
a
very
crude
and
clumsy
substitute
for
these
things
that
ought
to
be
precise,
careful
evaluations.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
sir,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
the
problem
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
we
would
have
not
no
way
of
saying
that
two-year
sentence
wasn't
inappropriate
punishment,
we'd
have
no
launching
pad
here,
you
know,
to
bring
us
here.
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
in
what
you
outlined,
we
would
have
a
case
where
the
judge
would
properly
exercise
this
discretion.
now
again,
maybe
fundamentally,
we
have
somebody
who
is
in
jail
because
of
the
neutral
fact
that
they
can't
pay
or
they
can't
be
punished
any
other
way.
but,
we
can't
--
you
know,
we
can't
launch
ourselves
into
this.
we
shouldn't
launch
ourselves
into
this
inquiry
into
what
role
all
of
this
play
and
how
it's
going
to
fit
in
with,
say
your
prior
record
in
this
kind
of
thing.
on
the
face
of
it
that
would
look
like
an
appropriate
sentence.
we'd
have
no
claim.
now
again,
this
is
--
that
illustrates
the
problem
with
hypothetical.
when
you
give
a
hypothetical,
it's
very
neat
and
simple
to
say,
to
isolate
that
economic
factor
on
through.
and
i
think
any
time,
you
got
that,
then
the
position
i'm
taking
is
somewhat
kind
of
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well
--
yeah,
i
think
here,
what
we've
got
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
that
--
no,
it's
not
a
relativity
argument.
i
admit
we
would
have
difficulties
on
our
habeas
hearing.
a
judge
can
come
back
and
said,
“okay,
well
you
can't
pay
a
fine,
then
i
sentence
you
to
one
year,
12
--
you
know,
and
11
months.”
or
something
like
that.
we
could
run
into
some
problems
at
that
particular
extreme.
but
neither
then,
as
i
say,
the
critical
thing
here,
what
were
talking
about,
you
know,
it's
a
very
modest
modification
of
that
particular
requirement
in
order
to
give
this
defendant
the
choice
that
is
open
to
affluent
codefendant
under
the
same
sort
of
sentence.
and
again,
i
want
to
stress
that
we're
not
saying
that
the
judge
be
blind
to
economic
condition
anymore
that
he
should
be
blind
to
the
call
of
the
man
who
stands
in
front
of
him
or
the
sex
of
the
person
who
stands
in
front
of
him.
these
are
things
that
the
judge
is
going
to
know.
but
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
that
statute
controls
and
it's
never
refundable.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
it
means
that
once
the
money
is
paid
in
it
sticks.
i
think
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
even
though
you
end
up
--
yeah,
you
could
serve
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
one
year
--
i
mean,
two
years
less
one
day,
and
if
you
paid
the
whole
fine
and
put
the
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
that's
not
–
that's
just
simply
our
attempt
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
if
you
browse
through
the
georgia
code,
you
can
come
up
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yeah,
i
think
it's
the
head
off
that
argument
exactly.
but
as
far
as
i
know,
none
of
that
money
has
ever
refunded.
if
the
state
of
georgia
gets
it,
it's
got
it.
now,
this
does
point
out
a
disparity
i
suppose
between
the
affluent
man
who
pays
his
money
right
away
and
then
stands
two
years
of
risking
and
losing
it
all
and
somebody
who's
on
an
installment
payment
who
plan
who
might
only
lose
part
of
it.
but
i
think
once
you
talk
--
i
think
that
de
minimis
disparity.
and
i
think
that,
you
know,
to
countervail
against
it,
the
man
who
is
able
to
pay
all
of
the
fine
at
one
point
has
that
one
condition
that
he
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
throughout
his
probation.
the
indigent
on
an
installment
program,
although
he
may
end
up
saving
money
that
he
doesn't
have,
you
know,
by
not
paying
it,
because
he's
locked
up,
nonetheless
has
to
suffer
under
that
additional
condition.
as
i
say,
the
basic
point
i
just
wanted
to
make
is
that
that
we
fully
agree
that
any
kind
of
decision
to
probate
is
part
of
this
state's
argument
is
necessarily
a
delicate
one
and
one
that
should
be
taken
with
great
care.
our
point
is
that
when
it's
made
to
turn
solely
upon
poverty,
on
a
financial
consideration,
then
it's
simply
not
rational.
that
kind
of
judgement
is
again
a
blunderbuss.
it's
a
--
it's
no
substitute
for
the
kind
of
evaluations
that
the
state
claims
that
it
stand's
for.
here,
for
example,
if
the
judge
has
decided
that
jacque
hunter
shouldn't
be
on
probation
because
her
family
was
going
to
provide
a
negative
influence
on
her,
you
know,
and
maybe
the
poverty
of
the
family
and
so
forth,
would
play
some
role
in
all
that,
and
then
had
to
put
on
probation,
we
wouldn't
have
a
case.
i
mean,
there
again,
the
judge
would
have
made
a
specific
evaluation,
a
specific
judgement
and
we
couldn't
impeach
it,
and
we
couldn't
get
behind
it.
even
though,
you
know,
poverty
may
have
played
some
particular
role
in
it,
in
a
non-hypothetical
way.
obviously
again,
once
we
get
in
a
hypothetical
situation,
then
we're
exactly
where
we
are
here
because
we
can
take
that
one
fact
and
track
it
all
that
way
down
and
we
can
play
with
it
and
see
how
it
may
have
been
used
rationally.
but
in
a
normal
case,
we're
not
going
to
have
that
particular
opportunity.
we're
going
to
have
to
presume
that
whatever
weight
the
judge
gave
to
it,
was
a
proper
weight.
that
like
race
and
certainly,
any
judge
who
can
see
is
going
to
be
aware
of
the
race
of
the
defendant
in
front
of
him,
and
that
might
mean
something
in
some
context.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
there
has
been
some
movement
in
that
direction,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that's
any
chance
at
all.
i
might
say
here
as
a
practical
matter
that
not
all
probated
sentences
pass
this
way
or
enforced
this
way
in
a
lot
--
the
great
majority
of
them
that
have
fine
conditions,
accommodate
that
particular
problem,
particularly
in
the
atlanta
metropolitan
area
and
some
of
the
other
metropolitan
areas.
but,
i'm
not
sure
what
they
do
this
--
you
know,
i'm
not
sure,
just
whether
they're
operating
under
that
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i
don't
believe
here,
your
honor,
that
there
is
some
risk
of
that.
what
we're
asking
for
is
a
slight
accommodation
of
that
sentence,
a
very
modest
accommodation
of
that
sentence,
modification
of
that
sentence,
and
one
that
in
practical
matter
is
quite
commonly
--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
we're
asking
basically
your
honor,
that
she'd
be
given
an
opportunity
to
pay
that
fine
in
installments,
in
reasonable
installments.
and
we
would
have
no
objection
to
it
if
the
state
wanted
to
--
there
is
no
reason
why
the
installments
should
stretch
over
the
entire
24-month
period
either.
it's
all
a
question
of
what's
reasonable
but
we
have
no
objection
if
she
is
required
to
pay
them
all
relatively
early
in
the
probation.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
sir,
this
is
a
--
this
again
is
something
that
a
trial
judge
is
going
--
you
know,
would
have
to
look
at.
obviously,
he's
going
to
have
to
evaluate
her
employment
potential,
the
job
market
possibly
in
the
area,
a
variety
of
things
like
this
and
determine
what's
reasonable.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
you
mean,
this
penological
theory
or
something?
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i
see
no
problem
with
the
fine
and
all
as
a
penalty.
you
know,
i
think
the
only
problem
here
is
the
indigency
has
to
be
accommodated
when
a
judge
in
the
name
of
the
state
decides
that
a
money
payment
and
probation
will
satisfy
penological
interest
of
the
state.
but
i
don't
see
--
i
think
justice
harlan's
concurring
opinion
in
williams,
made
the
point
that
the
effect
of
a
fine
is
liable
to
be
it's
pinch
on
the
purse
rather
than
the
manner
in
which
it
collected.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
that.
if
i
have
any
time
left,
i
would
try
to
save
them.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
your
honor,
i
didn't
draft
that
petition,
but
i
think
the
prayer
was
for
release
out
right.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
sir.
the
inquiry
never
got
into
that
fine
of
stage
because
what
it
happened
in
this
particular
case
is
that
the
court,
basically,
adjudicated
on
the
basis
of
the
prior
decisions
in
the
state's
supreme
court,
on
just
the
naked
legal
issue,
and
that
what
the
calhon
and
the
barnet
case.
the
hearing
was
really,
you
know,
if
you
call
them
hearing,
it's
sort
of
in
quotations
marks,
because
there's
no
evidence
taken.
there
was
no
proffer
of
anything
like
that.
it
was
a
rather
summary
type
of
thing,
more
legal
argument.
let
me
save
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
have
any.
