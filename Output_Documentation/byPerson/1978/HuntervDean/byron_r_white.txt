justice
byron
r.
white
well
she
certainly
didn't
use
those
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
the
record
would
have
to
show
some
--
also
some
finding
or
some
consideration
of
whether
she
could
pay
in
installments.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
says,
“i'm
thinking
that
$500.00
fine,
can
you
pay
it?”
she
says,
“no,
i
haven't
got
$500.00,
but
i'm
quite
willing
to
try
to
work
it
out.”
and
he
says,
“well,
if
you
can't
pay
it,
go
to
jail.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
judge
had
determined
that
this
person
couldn't
have
paid
any
fine
and
installments
or
otherwise
and
faced
by
debt
to
it.
that
first,
is
really
indigent
and
couldn't
pay
as
hard
as
she
tried.
she
is
just
disabled
for
example.
and
said,
“therefore,
two
years
in
jail.”
you
would
still
be
here,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you
require
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
say
instead
of
an
automatic
two
years
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
part
of
your
argument
is
that
there's
hardly
any
relationship
between
two
years
of
jail
and
a
$165.00
in
terms
of
serving
the
state's
penological
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
anything
--
are
you
arguing
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
other
possibility
is
that
they
were
just
saying
that
we
can
punish
you
not
only
by
a
fine
but
by
imprisonment?
because
that
it
might
be
--
that
the
inference
might
be
that
you
can
be
only
fined
or
imprisoned.
if
i
break
probation
and
sent
to
jail
i
should
get
my
money
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
asking
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
parker,
just
taking
short
of
any
relevance
to
the
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
there
we
had
a
texas
statute,
do
we
not,
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whatever
the
statute
but
we
had
an
attack
on
a
statute
there
i
think,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it
your
submission
is
that
30
days
or
$30.00
is
always
a
good
sentence
and
if
the
indigent
--
and
if
a
person
is
indigent
can't
pay
the
$30,00,
30
days
is
always
null.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
you
haven't
said
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
lump
sum?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
need
to
pay
in
lump
sum
or
you
have
the
specified
time
in
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
here
the
--
the
maximum
was
the
statutory,
what
was
it
--
well,
it
was
within
the
statutory?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
--
and
the
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
--
yeah,
but
then
how
much
probation
is
revoked
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what's
the
jail
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
was
it
in
this
case?
what
was
it
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
two
years,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
crime
for
which
she
was
indicted
carry
the
one
to
20-year
sentence.
in
this
case,
she
received
a
two-year
probated
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
so
as
well
within
the
statutory
limits
of
the
jail
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
--
you
would
say
the
judge
could
say
to
the
defendant,
either
pay
the
fine,
you
violated
probation,
now
either
pay
the
fine
in
a
lump
sum
or
go
to
jail
and
the
defendant
says,
“i
will
--
i
just
cant
pay
it
in
a
lump
sum.”
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can
pay
it
in
installments.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
not
violate
the
constitution
you
say
if
the
judge
said
“awfully
sorry,
but
either
lump
sum
or
nothing.”
