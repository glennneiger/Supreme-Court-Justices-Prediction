mr.
bonner,
if
you
prevail
here,
is
it
likely
that
georgia
will
enact
strictly
with
legislation,
and
impose
and
call
for
mandatories
prison
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
sometimes,
one
can
win
a
case
and
loose
a
lot
more
in
the
long
run.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
there
any
theoretical
difference
between
paying
it
at
once
or
paying
it
in
installments
as
far
as
the
legal
theory
is
concerned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
legal
theory
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
time
had
she
served
before
she
was
released
on
that
first
offense.
