justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bonner
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
fines.
i
notice
the
statute
provides,
as
a
proviso
in
it
that
provided
such
defendant
shall
not
be
entitled
to
any
rebate
or
refund
of
any
part
of
such
fine
so
paid
in
case
such
probation
shall
be
revoked
by
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
fair
to
infer
from
that
that
if
the
defendant
had
paid
the
fine,
had
been
put
on
probation
and
served
it
without
any
wrong
doing,
that
the
expiration,
the
period
of
probation,
the
fine
would
have
been
repaid
to
her?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bonner,
i
don't
understand
on
how
you
can
give
us
the
answer
you
did
to
both
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white,
i
though
you
said
that
if
she
came
in
and
said
that
it
would
be
$500.00
and
she
said,
“i
think,
i
can
pay
up,”
and
then
she
turns
out
she
can't.
he
cannot
put
her
in
prison.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
said
that
if
he
had
one
that's
a
rich
defendant
who
can
pay
a
thousand
dollars
and
a
poor
defendant
who
can't
pay
anything,
he
can't
put
–-
justice
john
paul
stevens
lets
--
i
don't
understand
the
difference
that
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
only
reason
the
poor
one
goes
to
jail
is
she
can't
raise
any
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
very
simple
if
the
only
reason
the
person
goes
to
prison
is
because
the
person
is
an
indigent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
that's
an
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
not
just
what
the
judge
did
here.
he
said,
“if
you
can
raise
a
$165.00,
you
get
probation.
if
you
can't,
you
go
to
jail.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here,
he
obviously
tried
to
treat
these
two
people
equally?
i
don't
know
how
it
could
be
more
plain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
let's
keep
it
to
the
165
then.
why
--
if
you
can
ever
put
person
in
jail
for
because
of
indigence
and
that's
the
only
reason,
for
me
it's
a
critical
reason,
why
can't
you
do
it
here?
that's
really
the
heart
of
the
case,
i
quite
understand
it
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
he
did
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
assume
its
all
was
non-willful,
let's
leave
willful
cases,
put
them
all
on
one
side,
just
the
inability
to
pay,
can
that
ever
justify
a
jail
sentence?
and
i
think
you
said
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
it
treated
as
a
neutral
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bonner,
can
i
go
back
for
one
second.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
question
i
started
with
about
the
proviso
on
the
statute
about
money
being
paid
back,
you
said
it's
not
normally
the
case
that
the
fined
is
refundable,
is
it
ever
the
case
under
your
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
its
never
--
the
proviso
just
is
--
it's
just
really
meaningless,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
proviso
is
that
it
won't
be
revoked
if
probation
is
revoked
--
i
mean,
it
won't
be
refunded
if
probation
is
revoked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
gives
rise
to
the
suggestion
that
it
would
be
refunded
if
probation
was
not
revoked?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
--
that
just
never
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
more
question,
i'm
sorry.
but
in
your
habeas
corpus
petition,
did
you
ask,
did
you
tender
an
amount
that
you
said
your
client
could
pay
or
did
you
ask
fore
release?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
your
client
could
pay
$25.00
immediately
even?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
parker,
did
you
say
earlier
that
the
petitioner
here
is
actually
out
on
her
won
recognizance
during
the
pendency
of
the
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
she's
till
out
right
now
then?
