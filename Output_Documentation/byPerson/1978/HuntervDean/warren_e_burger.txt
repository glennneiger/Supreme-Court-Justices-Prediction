chief

warren
e.

well,
since,
we're
dealing
with
hypotheticals
and
you've
just
mention
the
rich.
suppose
a
judge
has
a
man
before
him
who's
a
multi-millionaire
and
that
the
end
of
the
evidence,
he
finds
him
guilty
and
says,
“i
observed
that
you've
been
found
guilty.
now,
for
the
third
time,
driving
while
intoxicated,
endangering
people's
lives
and
each
time
we've
increased
the
fine,
very
clearly
fines
are
no
deterrent
to
you.
you
can't
be
punished
by
fines
because
you've
got
so
much
money.”
and
he
puts
all
this
on
the
record.
if
i'm
going
to
send
you
to
jail
for
30
days.

fulcrum
of

decision
has
been
because
he
is
so
rich.

well,
didn't

burger
didn't
she
say
categorically
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
she
say
categorically,
yes,
she
could
pay,
and
then
when
the
judge
took
a
further
step,
the
judge
said,
“how
are
you
going
to
pay
it?”
and
then
she
said,
“my
cousin
will
pay
it."
