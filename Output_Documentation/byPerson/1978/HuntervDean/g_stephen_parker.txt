mr.
g.
stephen
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
overwriting
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
it
is
constitutional
for
a
state
trial
judge
to
condition
probation
upon
prepayment
of
a
fine
where
the
defendant
represents
to
the
court
that
he
or
she
is
able
to
pay
a
fine
but
subsequently
is
unable
to
pay
the
fine.
and
for
that
reason,
is
not
allowed
to
serve
the
sentence
on
probation
but
rather
is
incarcerated.
an
underlying
issue
is
whether
or
not
a
trial
judge
is
should
be
able
in
the
exercise
of
their
vast
although
not
unlimited
discretion
to
consider
the
financial
resources
available
to
a
defendant
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
is
at
good
risk
for
probation.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
appeared,
in
the
superior
court
of
carol
county
in
december
1976
after
having
been
indicted
with
one
other
person
for
a
residential
burglary.
as
mr.
bonner
has
recited
the
plea
of
guilty
entered
at
that
point,
the
trial
judge
has
turned
his
attention
to
the
question
of
what
an
appropriate
sentence
would
be.
the
--
upon
inquiry,
the
petitioner
responded
affirmatively
that
she
would
be
able
to
pay
a
fine
and
that
a
cousin
would
be,
probably
called
upon
to
help
her
with
that.
trial
court
then
imposed
a
two-year
probated
sentence
or
two-year
sentence
on
each
defendant
to
be
probated
upon
the
condition
that
each
of
them
pay
a
fine
of
a
$165.00
plus
court
cost.
subsequently,
the
additional
portion
of
that,
the
money
for
the
attorney's
fees
was
stricken
with
trial
court
after
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
the
codefendant
was
able
to
pay
his
fine
and
was
released.
petitioner
however
did
not
pay
her
fine
and
remained
incarcerated.
she's
had
been
on
a
personal
recognizance
bond
for
the
duration
of
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
which
were
file
in
the
superior
court
of
carol
county,
there
was
a
hearing
held
at
which
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
other
than
the
transcripts
of
the
prior
proceedings.
now,
at
that
hearing,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
transcript
of
that
hearing
only,
very
recently
became
available
to
the
parties
and
the
time
the
briefs
were
filed
in
this
case,
that
transcripts
was
not
in
fact
available.
but
at
that
--
what
that
transcript
does
reflect
is
that
at
that
hearing,
there
was
an
assertion
by
her
attorney
that
he
believed
she
could
pay
the
fine
in
installments.
there
was,
however,
no
testimony
about
the
petitioner
in
this
regard.
that
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
the
possibility
of
calling
her
as
a
witness
in
this
habeas
corpus
preceding
which
of
course
could've
been
done
to
the
georgia
habeas
corpus
statute.
i
would
point
out
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
in
other
words,
your
honor,
the
attorney,
a
different
attorney
who
represented
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
could
have
there
roughly
understand
and
had
her
testified
-–
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
he
just
--
more
or
less
argued
the
law.
he
maintained
that
he
believed
that
she
could
pay
a
fine
and
installment,
but
there
were
no
specifics
and
she
offered
no
testimony.
now,
i
also
would
point
out
that
at
this
habeas
corpus
hearing
at
the
state
stipulated
that
she
was
an
indigent
at
that
point
in
time.
the
extent
that
we
do
not
have
that
transcript,
there
is
an
error
in
footnote
4
of
our
brief,
which
states
that
the
installment
issue
was
not
raised
until
appeal.
our
brief
was
an
error
on
that
one
point
on
footnote
4.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
she
remained
incarcerated
as
a
result
for
failure
to
pay.
and
then
at
the
hearing,
the
attorney
who
represented
her
at
that
time
advised
the
court
the
she
couldn't
pay
and
that
when
he
also
advised
the
court
of
his
belief
that
he
though
she
could
pay
on
the
installment
payments.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
he
could
have.
under
georgia
law,
a
judge
who
imposes
a
probated
sentence
maintains
control
over
that
sentence
for
the
term
of
probation.
otherwise,
he
would
lose
it
at
the
end
of
the
term
of
court.
now,
we
have
not
disputed
petitioner's
assertions
that
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
to
judicial
action
as
well
as
the
legislative
ones.
however,
i
believe
that
it
is
important
to
point
out
this
distinction
and
to
point
out
the
fact
that
the
basic
statutory
scheme
which
authorizes
the
sentence
in
this
case
has
not
been
challenged
at
any
time
by
the
petitioner.
this
court,
in
this
case
today
is
not
reviewing
the
application
of
the
statute
challenge
is
unconstitutional,
but
instead
as
being
after
declared
unconstitutional
an
active
individual
judicial
discretion
and
sentencing.
now
we
contend
that
this
is
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
i
understand
that
your
honor.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
i
understand
this
equal
protection
clause
and
nothing
more.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
your
honor,
it
certainly
has
relevance,
but
we
certainly
believe
as
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
that
the
facts
of
the
case
distinguish
it
primarily
because
that's
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
there
was
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
in
both
--
that
case
and
also
williams
versus
illinois,
there
were
statutory
provisions
and
question
which
authorizes
specific
sentence
in
that
case.
and
as
i
stated
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
a
challenge
to
the
statute
but
rather
just
to
the
judges
action
and
conditioning
probation
upon
pre-payment
of
the
fine.
as
we
noted
in
our
brief
and
i
will
not
(inaudible)
with
the
point.
decisions
of
this
court
have
not
treated
indigents
as
a
suspect
class
for
the
purposes
of
equal
protection
analysis
in
each
and
every
case.
for
this
reason,
we
contend
that
even
though
this
case
arises
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
that
pass
of
strict
scrutiny
is
not
the
applicable
test
but
rather
the
rational
basis
test
is
the
applicable
test.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
a
trial
judge
to
consider
a
defendant's
economic
status
in
determining
whether
he
has
a
risk
for
probation.
recent
decisions
of
the
court
have
underscored
this
point
in
cases
such
as
the
san
antonio
school
district
case,
more
recently
the
abortion
case,
meyer
versus
roe.
these
decisions
all
involve
legislative
or
administrative
classifications
but
they
did
make
clear
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
impact
of
a
challenged
statute
or
regulation
does
fall
most
heavily
upon
the
indigent
is
not
sufficient
to
constitute
discrimination
against
the
suspect
class.
now,
the
petitioner
contends
that
there's
a
distinction
between
cases
involving
public
funding
of
schools,
welfare
and
related
programs
and
between
cases
arising
under
the
criminal
justice
system
such
as
this
case.
there
are
some
supports
for
that
argument.
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
meyer
versus
roe
opinion
indicating
that
the
principals
of
griffin
versus
illinois
have
not
been
applied
to
legislative
classifications
generally.
but
i
will
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
contrary
indications
such
as
the
language
in
the
san
antonio
school
district
case
in
which
the
very
cases
of
tate
versus
short,
and
williams
versus
illinois
were
discussed
at
some
length
by
the
court
and
of
the
majority
opinion.
and
the
opinion
that
it
flatly
stated
that
all
of
the
judges
often
do
consider
a
defendant's
ability
to
pay
a
fine
and
imposing
a
fine
that
in
doing
so
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
sir?
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
your
honor,
the
georgia
provides
legal
aid
in
order
to
provide
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
trail
level
with
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
there
is
a
recognition
to
that
need.
the
discussion
of
the
tate
case
and
of
the
williams
case
which
is
contained
in
the
san
antonio
opinion
pointed
out
or
stated,
in
dicta
admittedly,
that
in
imposing
fines,
judges
are
guided
by
sound
judicial
discretion
rather
than
constitutional
mandates.
there
are
in
fact
a
number
of
cases
within
the
criminal
justice
system
in
which
this
court
has
refused
to
apply
strict
scrutiny
test
in
an
equal
protection
analysis.
for
example,
in
ross
versus
muffet,
the
court
in
1974
decision,
in
which
it
was
held
at
the
equal
protection
clause
nor
the
due
process
clause,
neither
of
them
required
the
state
to
appoint
counsel
for
indigents
on
discretionary
appeals
after
direct
appeals
had
been
exhausted.
there
was
reference
in
that
case
to
the
other
decisions
outside
of
the
criminal
law
area
in
which
indigents
have
not
been
considered
a
suspect
class.
i
would
submit
that
ross
versus
muffet
is
a
recognition
by
this
court,
that
is
it
is
not
possible
to
have
absolute
equality
within
the
criminal
justice
system.
there
are
other
cases.
now,
for
example,
the
court
rejected
an
equal
protection
challenge
in
a
case
involving
new
york
parole.
a
new
york
statute
said
in
parole
eligibility,
that
are
in
clearly
favor
in
those
who
had
been
or
just
clearly
discriminated
in
those
who's
been
unable
to
make
bond
prior
to
their
trials.
an
equal
protection
argument
was
summarily
rejected
in
that
case,
mcginnis
versus
roister.
would
also
point
out
that
an
examination
of
the
case
as
such
as
griffin
versus
illinois
and
it's
progeny
reveals
that
the
court
has
in
fact
invalidates
statutes
and
practices
which
have
placed
the
indigent
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
criminal
justice
system
for
no
rational
reason.
the
lack
of
a
rational
reason
i
submit
is
a
compelling
factor
in
all
of
those
cases.
now,
for
example,
in
the
griffin
case,
the
courts
found
and
i
think
very
correctly,
that
there's
no
rational
relationship
between
the
defendant's
ability
to
pay
calls
for
an
appeal
in
advance
in
its
guilt
or
innocence,
there's
just
couldn't
be
any
relationship.
and
for
that
reason,
and
others,
the
illinois
requirement
was
struck
then.
the
irrationality
simply
being
in
the
fact
that
the
merits
of
a
post
trial
motion
is
in
nowhere
related
to
a
defendant
financial
status.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
no
sir,
that's
is
not
our
position
at
all.
our
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
our
position
your
honor
is
that,
it
is
permissible
for
a
judge
to
convict,
to
impose
probation
and
to
provide
as
a
condition
of
that
probation
that
a
fine
be
paid.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
in
a
lump
sum.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
your
honor,
there's
certainly
limitations
on
what
a
judge
could
do
and
in
fact
the
georgia
supreme
court's
opinion
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
and
due
process
limitations
is
set
forth
by
this
court's
decision.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
your
honor.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
the
judge
could
have
fined
her
up
to
$2000.00.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
the
statute
provides
that
a
fine
may
be
imposed
as
a
condition
of
probation,
provides
that
the
fine
can
be
up
to
$2000.00.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
if
probation
is
revoked
then
the
defendant
would
be
required,
would
get
credit
for
the
time
spent
on
probation.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
the
max
--
well
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
and
this
case
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
and
there
you
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
at
that
point
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
at
that
point,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
for
the
court's
discretion.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
we
contend
that
it
does
not
violate
the
constitution
for
the
judge
in
the
exercise
of
his
sentence
in
discretion
to
impose
a
lump
sum
payment
upon
an
individual
in
the
condition
of
their
probation
upon
them
being
able
to
pay
that
fine.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
your
honor.
the
plea
of
guilty
was
to
the
crime
of
burglary
and
the
crime
period
sentence
--
does
carry
a
sentence
from
one
to
20
years
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
use
the
balance
of
my
time
for
our
basic
arguments
about
sentence
in
discretion
and
hopefully
cover
some
of
your
questions,
justice
white,
what
our
position
is
with
regards
to
what
the
judge
can
or
should
be
able
to
do.
let
me
just
first
state
three
basic
propositions,
which
we
are
advocating
with
regard
to
the
judge's
sentence
in
discretion.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
it's
not
constitutionally
required
to
--
or
it
should
not
be
required
--
the
court
should
not
be
prohibited
from
considering
the
defendants
financial
status
and
all
other
relevant
factors
in
determining
whether
he
or
she
is
a
good
risk
for
probation.
secondly,
we
contend
that
the
trial
judge
in
assessing
the
sentence
or
determining
what
appropriate
terms
of
probation
would
be
or
should
be
allowed
to
rely
upon
the
defendant's
assertion
that
he
or
she
would
be
able
to
pay
a
fine.
now,
in
this
case,
i
would
point
out
that
the
defendant
was
represented
by
appointed
counsel
and
there's
no
challenge
to
counsels
confidence
and
no
challenge
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
no,
your
honor.
she
said
she
could
pay,
he
didn't,
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
what
--
she
didn't
say
it
in
response
to
the
amount
that
was
given
but
she
said
she
could
pay
a
fine
without
to
the
amount
and
there's
no
indication
that
counsel
was
there
looking
his
duty
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
she
said
she
could
pay
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
yeah.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
that
is
right
mr.
chief
justice,
she
--
the
judge
did
not
simply
rely
upon
her
assertion
that
she
could
pay.
he
asked
her
how
she
could
pay.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
no
sir,
i
know
what's
on
the
record.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
that
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
he
said
--
to
be
verbatim,
he
said
“jacquelyn,
how
can
you
pay
a
fine?”
and
then
that
point,
she
responded
with
the
statement.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
well,
i
apologize
for
any
presumption.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
but
we
--
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
where
a
defendant
is
represented
by
counsel
and
indicates
to
the
court,
after
having
been
advised
with
counsel
and
after
having
into
a
plea
of
guilty,
that
she
can
in
fact
pay
a
fine.
and
then
i
should
also
point
out
that
there
was
no
effort
made
to
withdraw
the
guilty
plea
at
that
time
where
there
was
no,
at
least
the
record
reflects,
no
complaint
of
any
type
about
either
the
sentence
or
the
fine
or
any
other
aspect
of
the
case.
our
position
is
that
the
--
to
allow
that
the
sentencing
court
to
consider
all
pertinent
factors
is
a
very
consistent
of
what
this
court
has
decided
in
numerous
cases,
such
as
william
versus
new
york
in
1949
case,
in
which
the
court
stated
emphatically
that
under
the
modern
philosophy
of
penology,
the
punishment
is
supposed
to
fit
the
offender
and
not
merely
the
crime.
the
rational
of
that
decision
was
recently
reiterated
by
the
court,
and
the
decision
handed
down
on
june
26
of
this
year.
i
--
after
the
filing
of
that
brief,
united
states
versus
grayson,
in
which
the
majority
of
this
court
held
that
--
upheld
the
action
of
a
federal
trial
judge
who
had
stated
on
the
record
that
he
had
given
a
particular
defendant
a
longer
sentence
because
of
his
personal
belief
that
the
defendant
had
lied
on
the
stand
while
he
is
testifying
his
own
behalf.
the
grayson
court
concluded
that
a
defendant's
truthfulness
or
mendacity
was
relevant
to
his
prospects
of
rehabilitation
as
a
reflection
of
his
attitude
towards
society.
the
facts
are
obviously
quite
different,
but
we
submit
that
under
the
rationale
of
grayson
and
similar
cases
that
to
allow
sentencing
judge
to
consider
along
with
many
other
factors,
the
financial
resources
available
to
a
defendant
in
the
event
he
is
sentenced
to
probation
is
constitutional
and
is
in
fact
desirable.
now,
we
do
point
out
in
our
brief
that
in
probably
the
majority
of
cases
would
not
even
be
a
germane
factor.
in
some
case,
very
serious
crimes,
there
would
not
be
any
factor
at
all
to
consider.
but
nevertheless,
the
court
should
not
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
recognize
that
someone
is
perhaps
a
better
risk
for
probation
because
of
their
ability
to
pay
a
fine
into
the
court
under
such
circumstances
as
the
court
dictates.
now,
to
ignore
that
factor
would
in
fact,
be
to
ignore
reality
and
i
believe
that
an
example
of
the
reality
of
that
is
that
since
1945,
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
have
provided
that
a
pre-sentence
investigation
shall
contain
an
information
about
the
defendant's
financial
condition
along
with
many
other
factors.
the
decision
to
grant
probation
is
in
fact
difficult
or
perhaps
more
difficult
in
the
decision
of
what
number
of
years
to
give
one
who
is
going
to
be
incarcerated,
has
great
consequences
for
the
defendant
obviously,
and
also
for
society.
we
submit
that
the
trial
judge
should
not
be
encumbered
in
carrying
out
this
very
difficult
function.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
she
was
granted
a
personal
recognizance
bond
of
some
type
but
the
u.s.
district
court
from
the
middle
district
of
georgia,
and
i
believe
that
occurred
after
a
federal
habeas
petition
was
filed.
the
petition
was
held
in
advance
pending
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
but
she
was
out
on
this
--
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
yes
sir,
as
far
as
i
know,
she
is.
mr.
g.
stephen
parker
the
guilty
plea
was
entered
on
december
13,
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
was
on
february
