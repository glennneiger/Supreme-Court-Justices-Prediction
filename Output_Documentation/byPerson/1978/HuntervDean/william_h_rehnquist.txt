what
if
she
had
been
sentenced
to
pay
the
fine
in
installments
which
she
was
concededly
able
to
pay
at
the
time
and
she
with
the
sentence
was
imposed.
and
then
four
months
later,
she
defaulted
on
an
installment
and
offered
testimony
on
habeas
that
she
is
simply
wasn't
able
to
financially
pay
that
installment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
what's
your
answer
to
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
that
suggest
that
there
is
a
point
in
time
at
which
the
court
has
to
make
it's
decision
and
the
factors
that
go
into
the
constitutionality
of
it's
decision,
it
has
to
be
judge
as
of
that
point
in
time
rather
than
four
months
later
or
six
months
later?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
--
supposing
in
this
case
that
the
trial
judge
was
assured
by
her.
now,
if
the
record
is
apparently
muddy
and
you
claim
otherwise,
that
she
was
able
to
pay
the
fine
or
someone
would
pay
it
on
her
behalf,
and
he
therefore
quite
consciously
decided,
“i
will
suspend
the
imposition
of
sentence
and
impose
a
fine
on
you.”
now,
can
she
come
in
four
months
later
and
say,
“well,
i
know
that
the
representation
was
made
at
the
sentencing,
i
could
pay
the
fine.
but
in
fact,
i
couldn't
have
paid
it
then.”
is
that
grounds
for
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right
at
the
time
of
the
sentence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right
at
the
time
sentence
is
imposed.
a
judge
can
look
at
a
wealthy
defendant
and
say,
“i
fine
you
a
thousand
dollars,”
he
can
look
an
indigent
defendant
convicted
at
the
same
offense
pleading
guilty
with
the
same
offense
and
say,
“i
know
you
can't
pay
any
fine,
so
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
to
10
days
in
jail.”
