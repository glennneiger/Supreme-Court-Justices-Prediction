mr.
oberly
did
the
police
officer
asked
if
the
driver
had
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
didn’t
i
know,
but
would
you
say
would
the
state
have
--
would
it
permissible
for
him
to
inquire
of
the
driver
on
that
subject
on
a
random
basis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
officer
had
the
right
i
suppose
to
ask
the
man
if
he
had
a
drink
within
the
last
hour?
justice
john
paul
stevens
apart
from
the
state
policy
is
there
any
--
does
the
record
show
whether
this
particular
officer
was
working
pursuant
to
any
local
policy
or
is
it
just
his
own
initiative?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
oberly
you
mentioned
the
hundreds
of
people
would
be
inconvenienced
by
the
suggestion
mr.
justice
powell
made.
does
the
record
tell
us
how
often
these
random
stops
are
made,
are
there
hundreds
of
people
stopped
or
is
it
--
and
if
they
are
not
is
this
--
how
can
you
be
sure
this
is
more
effective
than
the
other
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
about
this
particular
officer,
we
don’t
know
how
often
he
does
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
suppose
that
means,
maybe
a
couple
of
times
a
week
or
couple
of
times
a
day
or
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
does
it
say
two
or
three
times
a
week,
this
a
really
a
very
significant
deterrent,
is
he
going
to
catch
very
many
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don’t
know
that
they
all
do
it.
you
told
us
there
is
no
state
policy
or
any
local
policy.
this
is
one
individual
happens
to
be
out
--
extra
time,
he
thought
he'd
somebody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
tell
us
how
often
or
how
successful
the
program
is,
how
many
people
they
actually
find
without
driver’s
license
or
you
don’t
really
have
any
information
that
tell
us
how
wise
this
policy
is,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lukoff,
just
stopping
and
asking
for
a
driver’s
license,
how
would
they
find
a
man
in
the
trunk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lukoff,
do
you
understand
the
state
of
delaware
to
be
seeking
to
justify
this
practice
on
the
basis
that
there’s
some
probability
or
at
least
the
possibility
that
by
stopping
cars,
they
may
find
some
dead
bodies
and
guns
and
so
forth
on?
is
there
a
justification
for
this
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
if
it
was
you
could
stop
people
in
high
crime
areas
and
say
do
you
have
a
gun
and
frisk
them
and
a
lot
of
ways
you
can
find
evidence
of
crime
if
you
don’t
have
any
limitation
on
the
amount
of
stopping
and
searching
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lukoff,
on
the
question
that
was
raised
before
your
opponent
says
the,
suggests
that
the
test,
the
ultimate
test
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
one
of
reasonableness
and
in
your
view
is
there
any
difference
in
the
strength
of
the
presumption
of
reasonableness
of
state
action
depending
on
whether
the
policy
determination
that
has
been
made
by
a
state
legislature
on
the
one
hand
or
by
an
isolated
police
officer
on
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lukoff
i
have
a
rather
serious
question
to
ask.
the
record
as
i
understand
it
shows
mr.
prouse
was
not
the
driver
of
the
car.
there
were
three
passengers
in
the
car
and
the
officer’s
testimony
suggest
he
was
not
the
driver.
so
i
don’t
think
under
the
rakas
against
illinois
he
has
standing
to
raise
the
federal
constitutional
issue.
so
isn’t
it
necessary
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improperly
granted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
officer
testified,
“i
don’t
believe
he
was
the
driver,”
it
indicates
here
as
one
arrested
--
this
page
a12
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
record
shows
he
was
the
owner
of
the
vehicle?
