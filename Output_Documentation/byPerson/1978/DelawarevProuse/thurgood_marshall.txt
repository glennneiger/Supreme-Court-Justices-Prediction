justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
the
word
random.
is
that
really
the
word
or
do
they
stop
whoever
they
have
some,
the
phrase,
gut
reaction
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
have
to
stop
every
fourth
car
that’s
what
i’d
think
it
would
be
random.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
restriction
on
who
can
be
stopped?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
a
police
officer
stop
all
negroes
and
would
that
be
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
he
stopped
20%
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
stopped
all
women
that
would
be
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
alright
to
stop
all
women?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
only
stopped
whoever
he
wants
to
stop?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
terry
does
not
supply
that,
any
help
for
you
there
at
all,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
he
stop
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
this
court
went
to
great
details
in
explaining
what
happened
in
terry,
that
policeman
was
--
terry
for
about
three
or
fours
hours,
didn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
terry
the
policeman
barged
man
casing
the
joint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
this
driver
casing
any
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
he
doing?
he
was
driving
the
car.
there’s
nothing
illegal
in
that
at
all,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he
didn’t
stop
him
to
see
if
he
has
a
sticker?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
hope
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
say
about
treated
equally,
when
it
depends
on
which
policeman
you
pass
by?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
stop
--
in
the
situation
in
delaware.
it
depends
on
whether
the
policeman
wants
to
stop
you
or
not.
now
that
can
apply
to
everybody.
that
applies
to
whoever
is
in
the
area
of
a
policeman
who
feels
like
he
ought
to
somebody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that
isn’t
equal
to
everybody,
that’s
up
to
the
whim
of
that
policeman
at
that
time,
more
likely
whether
he
had
bad
coffee
for
breakfast
or
not,
isn’t
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
isn’t
what
you
try
to
keep
away
from
with
policeman?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
for
example
the
policeman
said
he
knew
the
smell
of
marijuana,
how
did
he
happen
to
know
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
why
do
we
have
them
dogs
specially
trained
to
smell
marijuana
if
they
are
police
who
can
smell
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
regulation,
statewide
regulation
of
the
police
department
which
says
that
you’re
authorized
to
do
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
don’t
you
have
a
[inaudible]
arrested
and
things
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
not
have
a
manual
for
the
police
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
manual
for
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
is
that
in
the
training
manual?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don’t
know
any
statewide
regulation
which
requires
the
police
officer
to
do
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
ask
you
there
are
more
drivers
than
there
are
hunters.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
describes
you
as
a
driver
and
you
are
not
a
hunter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
that’s
the
state
policy
and
the
policy
of
one
police
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
have
authority
to
speak
for
the
state
of
delaware?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
said
we
ruled
that
before
the
government
may
single
out
an
automobile
to
stop
it,
there
must
exist
specific
facts
justifying
the
intrusion,
conversely
a
random
stop
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
justifying
facts
is
unreasonable
and
unconstitutional,
that's
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
delaware?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
does
have
as
much
authority
as
the
designate
of
the
attorney
general?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
the
policemen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
understand
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
not
a
federal
case
on
that
date,
not
one.
there’s
a
pennsylvania
case,
a
new
york
case,
a
nebraska
case,
a
south
carolina
case,
but
not
one
federal
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
there’s
a
problem
in
the
last
paragraph.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
last
paragraph
of
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
opinion
says
specifically
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states’
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
did
mention
the
federal
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
something
i
think
the
last
paragraph
of
opinion
is
the
opinion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
hold
that
for,
which
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay.
