justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
delaware
pursue
the
practice
also
of
setting
up
random
check
points
at
which
the
license
of
every
driver
is
checked?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
many
states
do.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
not
talking
about
border
searches,
i
am
talking
about
random
check
points
that
may
vary
from
hour
to
hour
so
long
as
you
stop
every
car
that
comes
along
say
for
20
minutes
or
for
an
hour,
you
slow
up
traffic
temporarily,
that’s
done
routinely
in
my
city
of
richmond,
virginia.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
you
have
a
real
problem,
the
chances
of
catching
people
who
violate
say
a
license
law
would
be
much
greater
if
you
could
stop
500
cars
in
20
minutes,
then
if
you
go
around
at
total
random
picking
up
one
here
or
there
and
yonder,
don't
you
think?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
question?
does
delaware
have
game
wardens
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
game.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
a
hunter?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
or
perhaps
you’re
not
familiar
with
the
practice
of
game
wardens
of
making
random
stops
to
see
whether
the
hunters
have
licenses
and
also
to
see
whether
or
not
they
have
game
in
that
bag
that’s
unauthorized
to
be
killed
at
that
time
or
perhaps
duck
hunters
have
killed
wasn’t
the
limit.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
can
tell
you
personally
that’s
the
case.[laughter]
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
also
true
with
federal
game
wardens,
they
sometime
use
helicopters.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you’re
not
suggesting
that
protecting
game
is
more
important
than
protecting
the
public
from
unlicensed
drivers,
are
you?
