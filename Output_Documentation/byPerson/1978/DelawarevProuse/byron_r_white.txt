justice

this
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
delaware.
the
facts
were
simple.
a
delaware
policeman
and
a
policeman
cruiser
stopped
the
car
in
which
the
respondent
prouse
was
riding.
at
the
time
of
the
stop,
the
officer
had
no
suspicion
and
no
probable
or
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
car
was
being
operated
contrary
to
any
traffic
or
safety
law
or
that
any
occupant
of
the
car
had
violated
any
law
or
was
subject
to
detention
or
to
interrogation.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
stop
was
a
purely
random
stop
to
check
the
license
of
the
driver
and
the
registration
of
the
car.
as
it
turned
out
however,
there
were
incriminating
materials
in
plain
sight
in
the
car.
the
office
seized
the
materials
and
prouse
was
convicted
based
on
this
evidence.
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
set
aside
the
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
the
stop
of
the
car
without
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
some
crime
was
being
committed
violated
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
that
the
evidence
which
was
a
product
of
that
illegal
stop
was
less
than
admissible
in
evidence
with
the
purpose
of
convicting
brother
prouse.
the
conviction
was
set
aside
and
the
state
of
delaware
challenges
that
holding
in
this
court,
but
for
the
reasons
which
we
state
in
opinion,
we
have
filed
today,
we
agreed
with
the
delaware
supreme
court
that
this
stop
violated
the
fourth
amendment
and
we
consequently
affirmed
this
judgment.

justice
blackmun

powell

opinion.
