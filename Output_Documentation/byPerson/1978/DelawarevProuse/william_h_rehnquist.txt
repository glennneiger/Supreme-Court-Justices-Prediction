justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
doesn’t
random
by
definition
mean
nothing
more
than
the
person
is
driving
a
motor
vehicle
on
the
highway
that
there
isn’t
any
other
ground
for
stopping
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
delaware
have
a
safety
inspection
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
man
was
a
state
policeman?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
many
counties
are
there
in
delaware?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
percentage
of
the
population
delaware
is
concentrated
in
new
castle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
the
delaware
turnpike
between
wilmington
south
to
newark
and
stanton
in
new
castle
county.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
lanes
are
there
each
way
on
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question,
we
understood
each
other
including
all
the
police
in
delaware,
city,
county,
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
oberly
it
may
be
of
no
legal
significance
but
as
i
read
the
record
there
was
no
conviction
in
this
case,
was
there?
it
was
the
trial
judge
grant
the
motion
to
suppress
and
the
appeal
to
supreme
court
of
delaware
before
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
conceded
that
it
was
an
important
interest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
the
state
of
delaware
has
determined
apparently
that
the
way
it
will
further
that
interest
is
by
the
policy
of
random
stops
that
apparently
everyone
has
agreed
upon
and
discussing
that
you
describe
it
as
arbitrary,
the
state
describes
it
as
random
of
when
a
police
officer
isn’t
called
out
on
any
other
thing
more
major,
he
simply
will
stop
a
car
at
random
without
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
doesn’t
have
a
license
and
without
any
articulable
grounds
for
suspicion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
well
and
that’s
their
policy,
that’s
what
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
officer
--
well
that’s
what
officer
vena
did
anyway.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
let’s
say,
it
was
the
policy
of
this
particular
officer
to
do
that,
no
one
disagrees
about
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
unless
the
constitution
forbids
him
from
doing
it,
he’s
entitled
to
it
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you’re
response
to
the
chief
justice
certainly
differs
from
--
it
shows
that
you
differ
at
least
from
my
understanding
of
constitutional
law
that,
i
would
think
that
the
action
taken
by
the
state
here
and
represented
by
a
state
attorney,
represents
the
policy
of
the
state,
albeit
you
cannot
argue
that
it
is
a
uniformly
applied
policy
and
that
for
the
legislature
placed
its
imprimatur
on
the
policy,
it
doesn’t
make
it
any
different
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say,
would
you
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
was,
felt
itself
constrained
by
the
federal
constitution
or
that
it
was
simply
ruling
as
a
matter
of
state
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
didn’t
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
go
off
on
that
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute,
you’re
referring
to
as
a
safety
inspection
not
a
driver’s
license
or
motor
vehicle
registration
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
anyway
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
didn’t
rely
on
that
statute
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
motor
–
the
officer
exceeded
his
authority
under
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
whole
argument,
which
is
like
the
state’s
is
a
little
bit
of
an
amalgam
of
everything,
isn’t
it?
i
mean,
you
wouldn’t
want
to
subtract
the
nighttime
element
from
your
case
anymore
than
the
state
would
want
to
subtract
some
of
the
elements
from
its
case,
that’s
what
the
fourth
amendment
is
all
about,
reasonableness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
then
that
the
nighttime
aspect,
it
simply
doesn’t
making
any
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
officer
vena
had
testified
that
he
made
stops
only
between
sunrise
and
sunset
because
he
realized
it
was
kind
of
a
hairy
experience
for
somebody
to
have
the
whirling
red-light
pull-up
behind
him
at
night,
would
you
think
your
case
is
any
weaker?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn’t
there
a
factor
on
the
other
side
of
though
there
as
to
the
reasonableness
element
in
that
if
you
try
to
conduct
a
road
block
on
the
delaware
turnpike
when
it’s
--
at
a
busy
time
you
are
not
just
going
to
intrude
the
same
amount
on
the
people
you
actually
stop.
you
are
going
to
slow
down
and
stop
a
whole
of
bunch
of
people
who
you
–
is
an
--
inconvenience
them
in
a
way
that
you
don’t,
if
you
follow
the
policy
followed
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
as
someone
driving
i-95
delaware
turnpike
during
rush
hour
would
feel
confident
that
he
at
least
would
never
be
asked
for
his
driver’s
license
or
his
motor
vehicle
registration
because
the
state
couldn’t
setup
a
road
block
at
that
time.
