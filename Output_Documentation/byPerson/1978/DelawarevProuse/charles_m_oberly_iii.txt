mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
that
is
presently
before
this
court
for
consideration
concerns
a
very
narrow
question
of
whether
police
officers
will
be
permitted
to
stop
motor
vehicles
for
the
sole
limited
purpose
to
conduct
a
license
and
a
registration
check.
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
are
not
in
dispute.
on
november
30th
1976,
an
officer
at
newcastle
county
police
department
stopped
a
motor
vehicle
in
which
the
respondent
mr.
prouse
was
an
occupant.
the
stop
was
motivated
solely
to
check
for
a
driver’s
license
and
registration
of
the
driver
of
that
vehicle.
there
was
no
other
wrongdoing
or
facts
indicating
suspicion
at
the
time
the
vehicle
was
stopped.
upon
approaching
the
vehicle,
the
officer
noticed
the
smell
of
marijuana.
a
subsequent
search
and
arrest
ensued
in
which
marijuana
was
found
in
the
car
and
on
the
person
of
mr.
prouse.
at
the
trial
court,
a
motion
was
made
to
suppress
the
evidence
which
was
granted
and
the
holding
was
then
appealed
by
the
state
of
delaware
to
the
delaware
supreme
court.
on
january
30th
1978,
the
delaware
supreme
court
affirmed
the
trial
court’s
ruling
and
holding
that
random
stops
without
articulable
facts
to
justify
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
there
is
evidence
of
wrongdoing
or
unconstitutional
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
state
of
delaware
respectfully
disagrees
with
that
holding
and
sought
certiorari
in
this
court.
in
so
ruling,
the
delaware
supreme
court
specifically
recognized
that
there
was
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
its
motor
vehicle
laws.
furthermore,
the
delaware
supreme
court
noted
that
it
was
adopting
what
it
called
a
rigid
invalidity
rule
and
the
state
submits
that
such
rigid
rules
have
been
eschewed
by
this
court
where
they
do
exact
a
high
toll
on
the
public
and
where
they
can
frustrate
legitimate
law
enforcement
efforts.
it’s
the
state’s
position
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
reading
of
the
fourteenth
and
fourth
amendments,
a
requirement
of
articulable
suspicion,
erred
in
failing
to
apply
the
reasonableness
test
that
has
been
used
by
this
court
since
terry
and
brignoni-ponce.
the
reasonableness
test
to
measure
police
conduct
has
been
applied
on
numerous
instances
and
it
caused
the
court
to
consider
the
interest
of
society
measured
against
the
individual
rights
that
are
involved
in
a
particular
case.
the
test
that
has
been
set
out
caused
for
the
court
weight
the
factors
of
the
purpose
and
the
degree
of
protection.
the
public
perception
of
the
stop
or
seizure
that
maybe
involved
in
a
particular
case
and
the
alternative
methods
or
procedures
that
would
be
available
to
conduct
the
particular
search
or
stop
in
an
alternative
manner.
after
considering
these
factors,
the
expectation
of
privacy
of
the
individual
should
be
considered
and
the
intrusiveness
of
that
particular
search.
it’s
the
state’s
contention
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
erred
in
failure
to
give
full
consideration
to
these
factors.
that
had
it
done
so,
that
the
interests
of
society
would
clearly
have
indicated
that
such
stops
should
have
been
permitted.
initially
the
state
would
note
that
there
is
a
legitimate
state
purpose
in
determining
who
has
a
driver’s
license
and
who
has
proper
registration.
there
is
perhaps
no
area
of
american
life
that
is
more
regulated,
more
subject
to
rules
than
the
use
of
the
automotive
vehicle.
when
i
walk
out
of
this
court
room
i
will
be
effective
within
seconds
by
the
motor
vehicle
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia,
the
entire
way
home
will
be
affected.
the
state
of
delaware
and
other
surrounding
states
and
jurisdiction
has
a
paramount
concern
as
to
who
can
drive,
when
you
can
drive,
where
you
can
drive,
who
has
insurance
and
who
doesn’t
have
insurance
and
it’s
submitted
that
this
is
more
than
just
a
minimal
state
interest,
it’s
a
substantial
state
interest.
and
i
needn’t
burden
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
in
this
particular
case
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
yes,
justice
stevens.
in
delaware
a
registration
cannot
be
obtained
which
is
kept
inside
the
car
unless
there’s
insurance.
it’s
stamped
on
your
registration
that
it
is
valid.
so
in
order
to
even
get
the
stamp
you
have
to
show
that
you
have
insurance.
in
the
interim,
if
the
insurance
had
expired
during
that
period
of
time,
the
state
would
submit
that
you
would
be
able
to
inquire
because
delaware
statute
does
require
that
all
motor
vehicle
drivers
carry
a
certain
minimum
of
insurance
for
personal
liability.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i
don’t
believe
that
he
would
have
that
right
unless
he
had
some
articulable
suspicion
to
pursue
it
any
further
than
that.
the
state
is
asking
for
solely
a
limited
right
simply
to
check
whether
or
not
the
individual
is
qualified
to
drive
and
whether
or
not
that
vehicle
is
properly
registered.
it’s
not
asking
that
they
given
permission
to
go
any
further
than
that.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
your
honor
justice
marshall
i
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i
think
if
you
use
a
classic
definition
of
a
random
that
could
possibly
would
be
correct.
the
delaware
supreme
court
and
the
state
has
used
random
as
just
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
not
by
using
the
test
of
delaware.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that
would
certainly
not
be
alright.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
it
would
be
certainly
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
if
20%
of
the
drivers
in
the
state
of
delaware
happened
to
be
negroes
then
i’d
submit
that
that
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i
think
your
honor
as
you’re
indicating
upon
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that
would
be
correct
your
honor.
that
they
would
be
able
to
stop
whomever
they
want,
but
however
if
there
are
objective
criteria
that
came
forth
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i
believe
terry
does
supply
some
help
there.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no,
but
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that
is
the
state’s
contention
yes
justice
rehnquist.
and
i
would
indicate
that
in
terry,
the
court
did
state
that
it
was
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
harassment
against
either
racial
minorities
or
other
minorities
and
it
was
contended
in
the
opinion
that
it’s
virtually
impossible
and
a
futile
protest
to
lay
down
rigid
and
validity
rules
that
can
basically
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
yes
he
did
and
that
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i’m
sorry.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that’s
correct,
he
was
doing
nothing
more
than
driving
the
car
at
the
point
he
was
stopped.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that’s
correct.
this
is
a
threshold
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that’s
correct.
the
registration
would
necessarily
include
that,
that
car
is
properly
titled
in
the
name
to
whom
it’s
registered.
and
that’s
all
the
state
seeks
is
a
threshold
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
occupant
or
the
driver
--
i’m
sorry,
the
driver
of
a
particular
vehicle
is
qualified
and
fit
to
occupy
a
4,000
pound
vehicle
on
our
highways
or
in
the
states.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
delaware
has
a
yearly
inspection
of
the
automobile,
at
which
time
it
is
run
through
a
inspection
point
to
test
for
brakes,
safety
and
the
registration
is
signed
and
a
fee
is
paid
and
the
sticker
is
given
to
driver
and
it’s
put
on
the
license
and
the
car
owner
indicating
the
ownership
of
the
vehicle
is
unstamped
which
indicate
that
the
proper
insurance
is
all
there.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no,
the
sticker
is
displayed
on
the
license
plate.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that’s
only
yearly
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
there
is
no
set
policy
by
any
of
the
police
departments
in
delaware
that
i
am
aware
of,
that
requires
any
officers
to
conduct
random
stops.
random
stops
are
frequently
conducted,
however
and
have
been
conducted
by
the
police
departments
in
the
state
of
delaware.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
the
record
clearly
indicates
it
was
his
own
initiative.
at
that
particular
time
he
stopped
the
automobile
in
which
or
the
vehicle
in
which
mr.
prouse
was
located
in,
he
had
a
law
inactivity,
he
was
not
responding
to
any
other
crime
scenes
and
he
saw
the
vehicle
and
he
decided
to
stop
it
for
the
license
and
registration
check,
but
he
was
acting
on
his
own
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
as
soon
as
he
walked
up
to
the
car
he
never
had
a
chance
even
to
engage
in
initial
questioning
before
he
smelled
the
marijuana.
he
smelled
the
marijuana,
walked
back
to
the
patrol
car,
called
for
radio
assistance,
since
the
stop
was
going
to
obviously
longer
than
he
anticipated,
went
back
to
the
car,
asked
the
driver
and
the
passengers
to
exit
the
vehicle
at
which
time
the
marijuana
was
seen
in
plain
view
and
a
subsequent
arrest
of
mr.
prouse
and
a
frisk
of
him
found
the
marijuana,
the
additional
marijuana
on
his
person.
as
i
have
indicated
that
the
delaware
law
requires
that
every
driver,
except
in
very
limited
circumstances
be
licensed
and
to
be
licensed
it's
the
state’s
contention,
that
is
the
minimal
standard
which
has
been
setup
by
legislature
to
determine
who
may
drive
a
motor
vehicle.
also
the
legislature
has
set
up
a
minimal
standard
that
in
order
to
drive
an
automobile
vehicle,
so
that
the
citizens
of
the
state
be
protected
you
have
to
have
certain
minimal
levels
of
viability
insurance.
and
it’s
the
state's
further
contention
that
unless
the
police
officers
are
given
the
right
to
stop
the
vehicles
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
licensed
driver
and
whether
or
not
that
vehicle
was
properly
registered
with
insurance,
then
that
the
enforcement
of
the
state
motor
vehicle
laws
would
become
a
mere
novelty
and
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
well
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
it’s
combination
of
both.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that
is
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that
is
a
possibility.
however,
as
noted
in
the
footnote
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
opinion
that
all
sides
are
in
basic
agreement,
that
the
marijuana
found
in
this
case
was
in
plain
view,
that
actually
there
was
articulable
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
it
was
illegally
seized
and
never
even
got
the
trial
and
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
we
would
like
the
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
yes,
the
delaware
supreme
court
explicitly
held
that
the
stop
violated
the
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that
is
the
effect
of
the
holding,
that
we
are
no
longer
allowed
to
stop
people
unless
there
is
articulable
facts
that
they
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i
submit
that
what
--
that
the
test
that
the
supreme
court
applied
is
a
wrong
interpretation
of
what
the
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
is.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
as
to
other
crimes.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
it's
the
state's
contention
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that’s
the
state
contention,
we
cannot
possibly
enforce
these,
unless
we
have
that
right.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
your
honor,
it’s
the
state’s
belief
that
if
we
are
not
able
to
stop
absent
articulable
suspicion
and
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
ruling
is
affirmed,
the
meaning
of
that
would
basically
be
that
any
person
without
a
driver’s
license,
who
has
a
suspended
license,
a
revoked
license
or
no
insurance
is
being
given
notice
that
you
may
drive
upon
the
roads
of
the
state
of
delaware
unless
you
are
unfortunate
enough
to
either
drive
past
the
officer
who
previously
arrested
you
or
you
violate
some
other
rule
of
the
road
and
then
we
submit
that
it's
possibly
too
late
at
that
point
that
the
determination
of
who
is
fit
and
who
is
not
fit
is
whether
or
not
you
possess
that
license,
not
whether
or
not
you
violate
a
law
and
then
you're
found
not
to
posses
a
license.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no
it
does
not
your
honor
and
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
some
states
do.
it’s
my
understanding
of
course
the
boarders
patrol
searches
are
a
fine
example.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
it’s
the
states
contention
that
the
use
a
road
block
type
of
procedure
is
much
more
than
is
required
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i
have
never
seen
a
road
block
or
participated
in
one.
however,
i
submit
that,
that
does
not
solve
the
basic
problem.
one
it
inconveniences
literally
hundreds
of
people;
two,
it
necessarily
makes
police
officers
exercise
random
stops
only
at
certain
periods
of
times
in
certain
localities
pursuant
to
concerted
plans
or
efforts,
whereas
police
officers
maybe
driving
around
on
their
procedures
and
their
routine
patrols
and
may
have
laws,
may
have
times
when
they
really
do
not
have
anything
else
to
do
it
would
require
greater
effort,
additionally,
and
in
lieu,
in
addition
to
the
amount
of
inconvenience
it
causes
every
driver,
i
don’t
believe
it
necessarily
is
required.
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
a
case
in
which
there
has
been
no
evidence
whatsoever
presented
by
respondent
of
discrimination
the
state
submits
is
not
called
for
in
this
case.
the
only
possible
use
of
the
road
block
type
situation
would
be
to
minimize
the
conceivable
possibility
of
discrimination,
so
that
everyone
is
treated
equally
and
it
would
be
the
state’s
contention
that
while
that
could
possibly
be
the
effect,
on
the
other
hand
you
are
inconveniencing
literally
hundreds
of
individuals
to
gain
a
benefit
on
the
one
hand
and
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
in
your
random
stop
situation
you
are
referring
to?
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that’s
correct
and
there
is
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
the
state
doesn’t
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
the
state
does
not
believe
that
that
is
true,
there
is
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i
believe
he
knew
that
from
his
prior
experience,
prior
arrest.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
situations
involving
dogs
involves
suitcases,
luggages
where
it’s
not
burned
and
the
animals
are
able
to
ascertain
a
smell
that
human
wouldn’t
be
able
to
ascertain.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
referring
to
hundreds
of
people
i
am
referring
to
the
possibility
of
a
road
block
which
would
have
stopped
some
through
fair
and
line
cars
up.
i
am
presupposing
it
would
have
stopped
hundreds.
there
are
no
statistics
in
delaware
of
which
i
am
aware
as
to
how
many
random
stops
have
been
made
each
year.
the
only
statistic
–
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
he,
as
the
record
indicates
in
our
writ
of
certiorari,
he
does
it
a
case
only
when
he
has
a
law
–
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
unfortunately
the
record
was
never
explored
further.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
your
honor,
that
individual
does
it
two
or
three
times
week
times,
the
400
police
officers
in
the
state.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,

your
honor,
that
is
correct,
although
i
do
know
that
he
has
done
throughout
the
state
but
i
cannot--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,

no
there
are
no
statistics
kept
in
delaware
that
i
am
aware
upon
now.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no
there
is
not
any
state
authorize
except
the
statement
in
the
law
which
the
police
are
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
all
laws
of
the
state
in
the
motor
vehicle
laws
or
laws.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no,
no
we
don’t
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
there
is
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
there
are
police
training
manuals
which
acts
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
not
that
i
am
aware
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no,
i
do
not
know
of
any.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no
he
was
a
new
castle
county
police
officer.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
there
is
three
counties,
new
castle
county
has
its
own
separate
police
department
of
approximately
200
officers.
there
is
the
delaware
state
police
which
covers
the
entire
state
which
has
400
plus
officers
--
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
approximately
75%.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
the
entire
portion
of
turnpike
is
in
new
castle
county.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
there
is
three
lanes
in
each
direction.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
yes
i
am
not
aware
of
any
written
policy
in
this
area.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
the
bona
types
for
agriculture
products
like
california?
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no,
i’ve
been
a
life
long
resident
of
delaware,
i
do
not
know
of
any
policy
that
california
has
and
some
of
the
western
states
have.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
no
there
is
only
one
weighing
station
that
has
just
been
implemented
in
the
state
of
delaware
but
there
is
not
a
weighing
process
that’s
utilized
for
all
states
that
are
using
the
highway
either.
they
are
just
simply
stopped
again
same
way
on
usual
stop
to
check
whether
or
not
the
truck
drivers
have
their
correct
papers,
whether
those
are
interstate
commerce
papers
are
not
then
that’s
not
on
a
random
basis
likewise.
against
this
--
the
state
submits
is
a
substantial
interest
in
this
case.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
of
crucial
significance.
it's
submitted
at
the
encroachment
on
individual’s
liberty
is
minimal.
the
state
is
not
asking
for
anything
more
than
the
right
to
simply
check
the
license
and
registration.
it’s
not
asking
it'd
be
given
the
right
to
conduct
flash
light
searches
and
numerous
other
horribles
that
are
paraded
before
the
court
in
the
respondent’s
brief.
the
intrusion
is
minimal
at
best
and
the
anxiety
and
the
stigma
that’s
been
attached
is
been
submitted
grossly
over
played.
i
don’t
believe
that
any
of
the
citations
used
by
the
respondent
to
support
their
arguments,
certainly
the
use
of
brignoni-ponce
in
footnote
8
doesn’t
support
your
argument
and
the
reservation
in
martinez-fuerte
of
this
court
in
footnote
14
doesn’t
support
the
argument
that
this
court
has
in
any
way
laid
down
the
rule
to
guide
in
these
particular
type
cases.
lastly,
it
would
be
the
state's
contention
that
we
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
apply
the
use
of
the
word
reasonableness
in
interpreting
what
the
fourth
amendment
requires
in
weighing
the
society’s
interest,
the
loss
of
life,
the
property
damage
of
who
is
fit
to
drive
and
who
can
be
insured
and
weigh
that
against
the
minimal
inconvenience
of
a
driver
who
is
stopped
and
it’s
the
state’s
contention
that
that
would
come
down
in
the
side
of
the
state
to
exercise
this
type
of
activity.
there
has
been
no
allegation
of
discrimination
by
the
respondent.
there
are
no
facts
other
that
supposition
or
hypothesis
that
this
could
be
abused.
the
case
law
is
clear
that
in
situations
where
there
is
abuse
it
can
be
shown.
it
was
shown
in
the
highland
case
cited
by
the
defendants
where
long
haired
individuals
were
stopped
and
no
case
of
which
the
state
is
aware
has
the
exclusionary
rule
ever
been
extended
to
a
situation
in
which
there
has
been
no
proof
of
illegal
police
conduct
and
we
would
submit
that
that
would
be
an
erroneous
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
any
comment
that
the
state
would
like
to
make
is
again
the
respondents
relied
on
the
brignoni
heavily
and
i
submit
that
this
court
in
brignoni
noted
that
it
gave
border
patrol
officers
the
right
to
stop
cars
for
questioning
for
the
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws
and
it
used
the
test,
basically
articulable
suspicion
test,
and
the
reason
i
submit
or
the
state
submits
the
court
utilized
that
test
was
in
that
opinion
it
specifically
states
that
there
are
objective
criteria
in
which
you
can
determine
that
articulable
suspicion
such
as
somebody
might
use
a
car
of
a
certain
length.
it
might
be
mexicans
who
have
a
hair
cut
that
you
could
tell.
there
maybe
people
ducking
down
the
seat,
there
maybe
information
that
the
border
patrol
agents
have
received
that
would
give
the
articulable
suspicion
to
stop.
and
the
difference
between
those
cases
and
this
case
is
there
is
absolutely
no
indicia
or
criteria
that
a
police
officer
can
look
at
and
say
that
person
doesn’t
have
insurance,
that
person
doesn’t
have
a
license.
in
lacking
that
they’ve,
if
the
state’s
motor
vehicle
laws
are
to
be
enforced,
they
have
to
be
given
that
right,
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
abuse
which
can
be
dealt
with,
or
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
a
pretext
and
there
was
none
here,
then
it’s
not
proper
for
the
court
to
extend
the
exclusionary
rule
just
on
a
hypothetical
situation
that
does
not
exist.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
as
i
read
the
delaware
supreme
court
opinion,
it
simply
said,
“our
article
1
section
6
is
like
the
federal.
we
will
interpret
the
federal
constitution.
if
the
federal
constitution
would
require
a
certain
test,
we
will
go
along
with
that
and
it
is
very
clear--”
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i
don’t
know
whether
they
read
it,
as
they
were
compelled
to,
but
it’s
my
clear
reading
that
opinion
that
they
did
not
consider
state
constitution
separate,
independently.
they
took
this
solely
on
the
fourth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
m.
oberly,
iii
i
would,
don’t
believe
it
necessary
be
appropriate
i
think
the
supreme
court
has
very
clearly
indicated
that
they
interpret
this
as
a
fourteenth
–
a
fourth
amendment
case,
but
i
imagine
that’s
a
possibility.
