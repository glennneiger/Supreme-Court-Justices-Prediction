mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
in
this
argument
is
whether
police
officers
may
randomly
stop
motor
vehicles
for
license
and
registration
checks.
i
think
we
first
have
to
look
at
the
facts,
specifically
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
some
additional
facts.
we
do
not
disagree
with
the
state’s
position
the
fact
stated
in
their
appendix.
however,
there
are
some
additional
facts
which
i
believe
are
important.
first
of
all
this
was
a
night
time
seizure.
secondly,
the
word
random
is
very
important.
the
delaware
supreme
court
used
the
word
random,
the
delaware
superior
court
used
that
word.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
officer
vena's
answer
to
question
as
to
what
random
meant
to
him.
he
was
asked
by
the
prosecutor,
was
the
stop
in
a
random
manner,
that
was
essentially
the
question.
his
response
was,
i
saw
the
car
in
the
area
and
i
wasn’t
answering
any
complaints,
so
i
decided
to
pull
them
off.
if
we
define
random
in
that
way,
we
are
using
the
word
as
meaning
arbitrary.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
chief
justice
unless
there
were
some
facts
that
would
help
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
the
ultimate
result
of
this
rule
would
be
that
that
could
not
be
used.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
there
is
obviously
no
question
that
they
could
assist
the
victim,
that’s
the
first
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
i
think
the
ultimate
result
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
that
is
in
fact
the
case,
because
that
evidence,
because
the
seizure
will
be
invalid.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
the
example
in
the
kidnapping
case,
if
i
may
go
to
that
for
a
moment,
of
course
the
victim
could
testify
and
there
would
be
evidence
from
that
victim.
the
possession
of
the
person
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
you
cannot
testify,
that
was
my
understanding
of
you
change.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
is
not
their
justification
as
i
see
it.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that
is
in
fact
the
case.
the
state
is
not
asking,
as
i
understand
it
to
have
the
authority
to
go
beyond
just
the
initial
seizure.
they
are
not
attempting
to
search
the
vehicle
or
--
and
stop
the
vehicle
in
any
manner
looking
for
other
evidence.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
difficulty
of
course
is
that,
that
is
not
the
direct
state
interest.
it
would
--
i
think,
it
would
follow
as
the
most
horrible
situation
perhaps
that
assuming
that
in
fact
the
body
is
in
the
back
of
the
car,
that
if
the
seizure
is
invalid,
the
seizure
is
unconstitutional,
that
it
would
therefore
follow,
that
evidence
would
be
excluded,
but
that
is
not
what
the
state
is
looking
for
nor
asserting
as
an
interest
here.
their
interest
they
claim
is
one
of
traffic
safety.
that
the
documents
that
are
possessed
by
the
individual
in
someway
are
going
to
assist
them
in
that
traffic
safety.
the
other
--
yes
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
it’s
my
understanding
mr.
justice
powell
that
they
have
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
fishing
game,
they
have
an
environmental
protection
officer’s
game
warden,
similar
i
believe
there.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
i’m
not
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
i’m
not
familiar
with
that
procedure
although
it
would
appear
that
if
that
is
the
case
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
i
would
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
it
would
be
respondent’s
position
mr.
justice
powell
that
there
is
a
substantial
interest
if
nothing
else
to
protection
of
game
which
this
kind
of
seizure
or
the
person
who
is
licensed,
a
specific
hunting
license
to
carry
a
weapon
be
it
a,
any
antique
weapon
or
a
modern
gun.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
from
unlicensed
drivers?
if
it’s
merely
a
question
of
unlicensed
drivers
i
think
that
there
perhaps
is
a
greater
protection
or
at
least
the
same
protection,
but
from
unsafe
drivers
it’s
a
different
question.
unsafe
drivers
are,
we’d
submit
are
greater.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that
is
also
true
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
they
are
at
least
equally
important
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice.
another
important
factor
that
i
believe
was
brought
out
by
mr.
justice
powell
was
that
there
are
no
regulations.
if
this
such
an
important
interest
to
the
state
why
does
not
the
state
through
legislation
or
through
the
attorney
general’s
opinions
or
through
police
officers,
superior
police
officers'
guidelines,
setup
regulations
for
these
types
of
stops.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
did
not
concede
that
--
we
concede
that
traffic
safety
is
an
important
interest
and
that
is
the
asserted
interest
that
the
state
has
presented
here.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that
is
what
the
state
is
attempting
to
get.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
i
would
disagree
sir.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that
is
not
as
i
understand
it
the
state
policy
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
refer
specifically
to
questioning
of
officer
vena
in
the
suppression
hearing
in
which
he
was
asked
about
whether
there
are
departmental
regulations
and
he
answered
in
the
negative,
none
that
he
knew
of.
whether
there
was
an
attorney
general
guideline
and
he
also
answered
in
the
negative
and
i
have
reviewed
the
statutes
and
there’s
nothing
in
the
statutes
which
permit
this.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
well,
the
disagreement
is
that
he
said
he
does
it
sometimes.
i
don’t
know
if
it’s
full
blown
policy,
but
the
problem
there
of
course
is
that
leads
to
individual
officer’s
whim,
it’s
arbitrary,
he
can
choose
whom,
whoever
he
pleases,
for
whatever
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
our
position
is
that
the
constitution
in
fact
forbids
him
from
doing
it,
the
fourth
amendment
specifically.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that
is
true
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
chief
justice,
the
difficulty
with
the
randomness
is
how
you
test
whether
it
is
truly
random.
if
there’s
a
--
some
form
of
electronic
device
which
picks
every
tenth
car
in
a
truly
random
matter
that
maybe
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
we
can
assume
that
but
we
can’t
assume
that
he
is
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
he
doesn’t
need
that
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
difficulty
is
that
how
do
we
check
as
to
whether
he
in
fact
is
doing
it.
again,
it’s
arbitrary.
if
he
--
all
he
says
as
i
stop
the
tenth
car,
we
don’t
know
it
wasn’t
the
11th
or
the
9th.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
chief
justice
that
presents
a
slightly
different
problem.
there
are
different
legal
issues
that
maybe
involved.
if
the
legislature
has
spoken
being
the
duly
elected
officials
of
the
people,
the
question
there
is
again
there’d
have
to
be
someway
to
test
the
guidelines
we
submit.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
well
the
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
state
has
not
taken
upon
itself
to
give
us
any
guidance.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
that
can
be
shown
or
that
i
know
of
personally
about
the
state
of
delaware
in
which
they
have
said
this
procedure
can
be
followed.
it
is
true
the
state
has
appealed
this
case,
has
brought
writ
of
cert
to
this
point,
but
that
doesn’t
give
it
the
sanction
that
the
defense
would
submit
is
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
yes,
it
does
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
marshall,
i've
spoken
to
that
issue.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
at
being
one
of
the
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
clearly
as
much
authority,
if
not
greater.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
was
brought
out
in
our
brief
in
our
third
point,
the
question
of
whether
they
were
adequate
state
grounds.
we
brought
that
out
because
we
felt
the
court
should
be
aware
of
that.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
did
not
refer
to
brignoni,
did
not
refer
to
martinez
to
support
his
opinion.
there
is
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
significance
is
that
there’s
an
ambiguity
in
the
delaware
opinion
as
to
whether
they’re
relying
solely
upon
a
federal
question
or
in
fact,
they
were
also
relying
upon
independent
state
grounds.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
it
appears
to
rely
upon
on
both
but
again
it’s
ambiguous.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
if
it
does
rely
upon
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds,
then
this
court
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that’s
the
difficulty
with
the
ambiguity.
if
it
in
fact
relies
upon
those
grounds
then
this
court,
i
would
submit
would
have,
not
have
the
jurisdiction
because
it
would
be,
it
could
be
possibly
be
advisory
opinion
this
court
could
render.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
there
maybe
the
presumption
of
legitimacy
or
stronger
case
when
the
legislature
has
spoken
because
the
legislature
we
assume
speaks
for
the
people
and
perhaps
the
people
have
accepted
this
kind
of
intrusion,
but
we
don’t
know
that
in
this
case
because
delaware
has
not
spoken
to
this
specific
issue.
however,
it
has
spoken
through
statute
to
the,
specifically
to
the
question
of
non
annual
inspections
of
vehicles
in
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
title
21,
section
2144
in
which
delaware
said
in
essence
that
a
police
officer
may
upon
reasonable
cause
stop
a
vehicle
for
an
inspection.
that,
the
legislature
has
spoken
in
that
area,
spoken
about
non
annual
inspections
and
it’s,
that
appears
to
be
important
to
us
because
they’ve
already
made
a
decision
specifically
in
that
area
and
the
words
“reasonable
cause”
can
be
readily
be
interpreted
as
on
articulable
facts.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
the
question
of
safety
although
raised
didn’t
come
up
quite
as
clearly
perhaps
as
in
this
case?
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
it’s
a
safety
inspection,
but
then
the
registration
statute
is
also
safety
inspection
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
is
a
safety
inspection.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
they
did
not.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
they
didn’t
rely
upon
that
statute
in
reaching
their
opinion.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
yes,
we
did
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
yes,
we
did.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
they
do
not
speak
of
the
state
constitution
in
the
last
paragraph,
that
is
true.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
they’ve
clearly
mentioned
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
they
also
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
first
paragraph
spoke
about
both
a
violation
of
the
federal
and
state
constitutional
guarantees,
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
opinion.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
i
agree.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
again,
not
referring
to
the
state
constitution.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
the
delaware
supreme
court
interpreted
the
state
constitution
as
being
essentially
the
same
as
--
the
state
constitution
provision
as
being
essentially
the
same
as
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
i
believe
that
may
have
been
how
the
question
was
asked,
it
was
referred
to
on
briefs
by
both
sides
and
the
issue
was
argued
on
a
federal
constitutional
grounds
below
even
though
the
state
constitution
obviously
has
provisions
which
are
comparable
to
the
federal
constitution.
beyond
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
we’re
talking
about
here,
i
think
it’s
important
that
the
court
look
at
the
nature
of
the
intrusion.
here’s
a
night
time
stop,
7:20
in
the
evening,
november.
the
lights
are
used.
there’s
clearly
the
anxiety,
the
concern,
the
fear,
the
similar
kinds
of
anxiety
and
subjective
intrusion
that
this
court
has
considered
so
important
in
brignoni.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
it
would
not
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
chief
justice,
it
wouldn’t
be
different
in
the
constitutional
aspects.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
the
nature
of
the
–
the
reason
i
brought
in
the
fact
that
it
was
nighttime
is
because
it
shows
that
this
type
of
arbitrary
seizure
can
be
accomplished
at
anytime
of
the
day
or
night.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
it
does
not,
it
does
not.
it
goes
to
the
subjective
nature
of
the
intrusion
to
some
extent,
it’s
a
factor.
the
individuals,
sudden
appearance
of
the
vehicle,
the
police
vehicle
with
the
lights
and
the
siren
etcetera,
this
is
the
nature
of
the
subjective
intrusion
how
it’s
affecting
the
individual
who
is
being
seized.
the
day
or
night
is
a
factor,
but
not
a
constitutional
factor
in
that
sense
it
goes
to
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
itself.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
whether
or
not
it
was
day
or
night,
in
the
balance,
in
the
reasonableness
balance
not
--
we
submit
make
a
difference.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
it’s
one
additional
factor.
it
doesn’t
in
the
ultimate
testing,
it’s
in
a
factor
and
only
that
the
stop
was
nighttime,
it’s
a
fact
that
was
there.
the
court,
i
don’t
believe
could
fashion
a
rule
that
said
it’s
okay
in
the
day
time,
but
not
at
nighttime,
we
are
not
asking,
we’re
suggesting.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
position
of
the
defendant
is
that
the
random
checkpoint
stops
which
the
state
of
delaware
specifically
did
not
reach
in
the
lower
opinion
or
as
this
court
has
held
less
intrusive
in
terms
of
the
both
subjective
and
the
objective
intrusiveness
i
believe
that
was
held
in
martinez
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
it’s
less
intrusive,
but
it
raises
other
issues.
it
is,
we
believe
would
be
a
one
factor
in
deciding
the
nature
of
--
the
difficulty
of
course
is
that
the
random
stop,
excuse
me
the
road
block
point
does
eliminate
some
of
the
intrusiveness.
whether
it
is
still
constitutionally
permissible,
makes
a
more
difficult
question,
to
say
the
least
because
of
the
less
intrusive
nature.
in
the
balancing
test
it
may
sway
the
scales
towards
the
validity
of
the
stop.
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
say
that
it
in
fact
does
do
that.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
that
maybe
true
based
--
but
again
the
requirement
i
think
if
you
use
the
road
block
type
of
--
assuming
the
road
block
is
a
valid
constitutional
mechanism,
if
you
use
it,
it
would
appear
important
to
say
the
least
that
the
state
setup
guidelines
as
to
when
it
can
be
used
and
what
time
so
to
lessen
that
kind
of
inconvenience
that
would
perhaps
come
out
of
an
i-95,
the
delaware
turnpike
rush
hour
problem.
i
think
that
that
kind
of
problem
can
be
circumvented
by
using
--
by
setting
up
your
road
blocks,
if
you
are
going
to
use
them
and
if
that
is
a
permissible
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
no
i
am
not
suggesting
they
can’t
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
i
believe
the
factors
--
the
time
element
is
important
in
the
decision
as
to
whether
a
road
block
would
be
effective
and
there
maybe
a
greater
interest
in
lack
of
inconvenience
--
in
the
inconvenience
to
the
generally
lawfully
motoring
public
than
there
would
be
gained
from,
in
a
safety
manner
from
stopping
every
vehicle.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
record
is
ambiguous.
there
is
some
question
--
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
he
talked
about
--
the
officer
did
testify
in
that
regard
and
--
but
he
wasn’t
clear
totally,
and
a
part
of
that
difficulty
of
course
is
that,
it’s
clear
from
the
record
that
mr.
prouse
was
the
registered
owner
of
the
vehicle
that
he
had
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
vehicle
because
of
his
ownership.
i
don’t
believe
rakas
would
apply
in
a
standing
aspect
here
because
if
i
recall
rakas
that
type
of
--
they
didn’t
reach
the
decision
as
to
whether
the
registered
owner,
or
if
they
did
they
spoke
the
registered
owner
had
the
proprietary
interest,
the
rakas
as
i
understand
spoke
about
the
passengers,
who
had
no
proprietary
interest.
mr.
david
m.
lukoff
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
am
looking
at
the
state’s
appendix
referring
to
a10
and
the
answer
is,
“i
know
the
car
was
registered
to
him,
but
i
don’t
know
who
is
driving.”
so
that
develops
both
the
ownership
of
his
but
also
the
ambiguity
as
to
who
was
driving
as
to
that
answer.
obviously
this
whole
page
has
a
lot
to
do
with
police
officers
discretion
and
this
court
has
throughout
its
history
spoken
about
the
concept
of
unfettered
discretion
in
police
officers,
and
their
ability
to
take
actions
without
guidelines
or
controls.
it’s
our
position
that
the
state
interest
asserted
as
safety
is
not
in
fact
enhanced
by
these
stops.
it’s
further
our
position
that
a
rule
permitting
these
kind
of
stops
would
allow
uncontrolled,
unfettered
discretion
of
the
police
officers
to
stop
whomever
they
please.
according
to
the
delaware
safety
council
148,900,000
vehicles
are
on
the
roads
today.
the
rule
the
state
would
have
you
determine
is
the
ability
of
a
police
officer
to
stop
any
one
of
those
vehicles
at
anytime
of
the
day
or
night
without
any
cause
on
the
pretext
of
checking
licenses
and
registrations.
that’s
--
that
power
is
great.
as
is
true
in
many
instances
that
power
should
not
be
abused.
absolute
discretion
like
absolute
power
corrupts
absolutely.
thank
you.
