justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
was
not
--
i
didn’t
think
the
issue
here
whether
or
not
the
state
could
do
this,
the
question
was
whether
having
done
it
in
the
manner
it
was
done
here
the
marijuana
seized
could
be
used
as
evidence
against
the
driver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
be
denied
that
without
being
denied
any
authority
to
stop?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
make
traffic
checks?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
i
thought
the
issue
really
was
whether
or
not
you
lost
the
conviction
of
mr.
prouse
on
the
ground
that
this
evidence
was
illegally
admitted,
didn’t
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
want
is
that
the
conviction
be
reinstated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don’t
see
if
he
moves
and
there
is
an
affirmative
of
that
at
all
stops
delaware
from
making
new
stops.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suggest
that’s
not
really
what’s
involved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
does
delaware
have
one
of
these
programs
for
checks
of
agricultural
products.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what’s
the
significance
for
the
sentence?
the
delaware
constitution,
article
1,
section
6,
is
substantially
similar
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
a
violation
of
the
latter
is
necessarily
a
violation
of
the
former.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
that’s
decision,
that’s
this
decision
rests
both
on
the
delaware
constitution
and
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
it
does
rely
on
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
does
rely
on
both
and
it
does
rely
on
an
adequate
--
independent
grounds,
is
that
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
oberly
would
you
comment
on
the
suggestion
that
this
decision
may
rest
on
the
delaware
constitution
as
well
as
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
it
didn’t,
i
don’t
read
it
as
saying
or
do
you,
that
we
are
compelled
by
the
interpretations
of
the
fourth
amendment
similarly
to
interpret
the
delaware
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
if
it’s
kind
of
case,
we’ve
had
several
of
them.
we
have
remanded
to
the
state
supreme
court
to
tell
us
whether
they
did
or
didn’t
rest
on
the
state
constitution.
do
you
suppose
that
might
be
appropriate
here?
