chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
delaware
against
prouse.
mr.
oberly,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there’s
nothing
illegal
in
it
and
driving
the
car
if
he
has
a
license
and
if
he
has
insurance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
doesn’t
have
a
license
then
it
is
illegal,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
point
is
that
delaware
claims
the
right
to
stop
any
car
to
see
whether
he
has
number
one,
the
license
to
drive
it
which
implies
carrying
insurance
and
that
driver
has
the
title
papers
to
the
car,
i
suppose
to
check
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
was
the
marijuana
package
in
plain
sight
or
did
he
detect
that
first
from
the
odor
of
the
marijuana?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lukoff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
is
it
your
position
that
anything,
anything
that
was
found
in
the
car
following
the
stop
may
not
used
in
evidence
in
any
criminal
case
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
instead
of
the
prohibited
drugs
they
had
found
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
a
human
being
bound
and
gagged
who
was
being
kidnapped,
you
couldn’t
prosecute
the
kidnapper
for
that
offense
on
your
theory
and
on
the
theory
of
the
supreme
court
of
delaware.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
take
the
same,
take
the
same
facts
precisely
with
instead
of
marijuana
it’s
a
14-year
old
girl
bound
and
gagged
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
but
still
alive.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
not
be
used.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
mr.
justice
stevens
is
the
entire
point.
the
state
is
asking
here
for
the
mere
opportunity
to
seize
the
vehicle
for
a
moment
as
they
state
for
checking
license
and
registration.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
add
a
fact,
the
victim
hearing
some
conversation
makes
enough
noise
in
the
back
of
the
trunk,
so
that
the
suspicions
and
the
policemen
are
excited
and
aroused.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
assist
the
victim,
just
save
the
victim
but
not
prosecute
the
kidnapper.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
having,
let
me
extend
that
beyond
instead
of
a
live
victim,
who
could
tap
on
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
get
some
attention,
policemen
having
found
some
illegal,
some
contraband
material,
marijuana,
heroin,
guns,
a
bag
full
of
currency
in
large
amounts
then
decides
to
search
the
entire
car,
and
he
finds
a
dead
body
in
the
back
and
your
theory
he
can’t
be
prosecuted
for
a
possession
of
a
dead
body
if
that’s
a
crime
in
delaware
or
for
the
murder
if
he
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
why
removed
to
somebody
who
to
somebody
who
can’t
testify.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
you
return
to
my
question
now
and
complete
your
answer
about
the
body
in
the
back
of
the
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn’t
think
the
conservation
of
game
was
more
important
than
the
control
of
marijuana
and
heroin
and
what
not,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
random
problem
has
no
relevance
here,
it
really
doesn’t.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
can’t
you
assume
that
a
policemen
can
count
up
to
ten?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
doesn't
an
electronic
device
to
stop
every
tenth
car,
does
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
response
to
mr.
justice
white
indicates
that
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
for
your
case
and
the
position
you’re
taking
whether
the
state
legislature
had
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
promulgate
rules,
guidelines
and
he
promulgated
them
and
said
the
officers
may
do
thus
and
so,
you’d
still
make
the
same
points?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
clearly
one
constitutional
–
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
if
it
been
high
noon
on
a
sunny
day
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
it
would
be
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
that
all
we’re
talking
about
here,
the
constitutional
aspect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
well
--
one
explanation
and
it
seem
to
be
an
obvious
one
that
at
12
midnight,
a
policeman
probably
has
more
time
to
make
random
stops
than
he
does
at
high
noon
and
therefore
he
might
do
it
more
often.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
actually
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
to
your
constitutional
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
lukoff.
do
you
have
anything
further
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
1571,
delaware
against
prouse
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
