chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
arizona
public
service
company
against
snead.
mr.
mcauliffe,
will
you
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
leave
that
entirely
in
your
hands
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
within
the
state
or
out
or
can
it
be
either?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
party
who
generates
the
electricity
may
sell
it
to
wholesaler
within
the
state
or
without,
is
that
so
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
just
the
one
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
unna.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
the
net
effect
the
test?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
net
result
of
the
transaction
is
that
the
electricity
each
kilowatt
hour,
it
goes
outside
of
the
state
pays
a
higher
tax
after
the
refund
is
when
adjusted,
then
that
consumed
within
the
stages,
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
because
we
get
what
it's
for,
let's
just
talk
about
the
mathematics
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
each
kilowatt
hour
which
goes
across
the
borders
of
the
state
and
into
another
place,
ultimately
pay
a
higher
tax
than
that
consumed
within
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
impression
that
in
your
brief
you
had
argued
somewhere
and
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
it
now
that
the
producing
states
has
to
suffer
all
the
environmental
disadvantages
of
presumably
coal
or
oil
whatever
is
used,
produce
it
or
that's
atomic
to
all
those
risks
necessary
whatever
they
are
and
did
that
justify
a
different
treatment
for
the
electrical
energy
which
was
exported
where
the
consumers
would
not
have
to
suffer
and
be
subject
to
these
environmental
disadvantages,
am
i
right
that
you've
argued
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
something
like
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
stay
on
my
question
if
you
don't
mind
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
argue
that
the
state
in
which
the
generator
is
located
puts
up
with
a
lot
of
burdens
that
the
consuming
state
or
the
republic
of
mexico
doesn't
have
to
suffer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
so,
why
that
would
appear
to
me
that
you
are
undertaking
to
justify
a
differential
treatment
between
instate
and
outstate
consumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what's
the
argument
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you've
have
anything
further
mr.
mcauliffe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
was
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
1810,
arizona
public
service
company
against
snead
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
