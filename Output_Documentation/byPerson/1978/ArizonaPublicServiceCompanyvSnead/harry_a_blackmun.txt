justice
harry
a.
blackmun
perhaps
i
am
wrong,
but
isn't
the
distinction
really
on
what
one
looks
at
if
it
one
looks
at
the
energy
tax
in
isolation
and
it's
discriminatory.
if
one
looks
at
the
entire
burden
according
to
your
approach
it's
non
discriminatory.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
people
who
retail
or
generate?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
unna,
could
i
focus
on
section
391
a
minute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
that
came
out
of
the
senate,
is
there
any
question
that
it
concededly
was
aimed
to
invalidate
new
mexico's
tax?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
what's
legislative
history
is
there
in
connection
with
statute
to
suggest
that
the
congress
adoption
of
the
phrase
“greater
tax
burden”
signaled
to
design
to
shift
the
focus
of
the
discrimination
inquiry
into
state
tax
system
as
a
whole?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
was
the
barrier
when
west
virginia
was
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
think
because
of
the
west
virginia
barrier,
you
had
a
completely
different
result
then,
as
to
new
mexico
then
when
it
left
the
senate?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
new
mexico's
benefits
accordingly?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
isn't
that
all
the
legislative
history
you
have,
those
two
letters?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes
but
beyond
the
senate
aren't
those
two
letters
all
the
legislative
history
you
have?
once
the
bill
came
out
of
the
senate,
once
in
the
house
and
in
the
conference
you
have
two
letters,
no
more.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
that
pretty
thin
legislative
history
to
support
your
view,
when
it
was
so
clear
in
the
senate
side
that
the
bill
was
aimed
at
the
new
mexico
tax?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
exactly.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
how
did
it
over
come,
how
was
it
overcome,
by
those
two
letters?
