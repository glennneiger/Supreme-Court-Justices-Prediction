justice
john
paul
stevens
just
before
you
leave
the
statute,
it's
of
course
you
rely
primarily
on
the
second
sentence
of
the
statute
i
guess
rather
than
the
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
the
discrimination
against
the
out-of-state
manufacturers
and
there's
no
out-of-state
manufacturer
that
is
being
discriminated
against
here,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
not
what
it
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
fact
you
read
that
as
broadening
the
first
sentence
basically.
the
first
sentence
literally
just
doesn't
apply
as
i
read
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
against
out-of-state
manufacturers,
producer's
etcetera,
but
you're
not
an
out-of-state
producer
within
the
meeting
of
this,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcauliffe
you
may
have
covered
this,
i
might
have
missed
it,
but
does
the
state
give
a
credit
on
the
gross
receipts
tax
to
an
out-of-state
generator
who
might
sell
electricity
within
the
state,
for
similar
tax
imposed
by
the
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
9(a)
does
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
amount
of
the
credit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
it
was
a
full
4%
then
it
conceivably
they
pay
no
gross
receipts
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
constitution,
you
would
agree
we
would
have
to
decide
the
statutory
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
unna
can
i
interrupt
once
more?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
no
tax
burden
whatsoever.
don't
they
pay
real
estate
tax
and
personal
property
tax
and
income
tax
and
various
other
taxes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
want
us
to
look
at
the
total
picture
or
we
just
look
at
those
on
electricity
per
se.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
unna
you
omit
the
possibility
that
the
electricity
sold
elsewhere
maybe
subject
to
a
tax
elsewhere?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
true
nevertheless?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
electricity
maybe
subject
to
a
tax
at
the
retail
level?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
correct
that
before
the
generation
tax
was
paid
there
was
4%
gross
receipts
tax.
that's
all
there
was
and
then
arizona
decided
that
it
wanted
to
--
new
mexico,
wanted
to
get
some
money
out
of
the
generation
so
that
they
are
placing
a
tax
either
two
plants
in
the
four
corners,
one
sells
entirely
within
the
state,
one
sales
entirely
without
the
state.
the
entire
burden
of
the
new
tax
falls
on
the
plant
itself
outside
the
state,
isn't
not,
doesn't
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
the
two
power
plants
i
described
just
one
of
them
would
really
bear
the
entire
burden
of
the
new
tax.
one
sells
out
of
state
one
sells
only
instate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
unna,
may
i
ask
you
question
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
with
specific
reference
to
west
virginia?
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
difference
between
the
west
virginia
generating
tax
and
the
tax
that
we
have
before
us
here
is
in
west
virginia
there
was
no
credit
against
on
any
gross
receipts
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
theory
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
total
tax
burden
--
you
taken
into
accrued
taxes
imposed
by
neighboring
states
on
the
retail
sale,
at
least
of
the
idea.
west
virginia
had
no
gross
receipts
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
significant
difference
between
west
virginia
and
new
mexico
is
the
absence
in
that
state
of
the
credit
against
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
taking
the
analogies
there
further,
go
back
to
my
hypothetical
of
two
power
plants
in
the
four
corners
area,
one
selling
out
of
state,
one
selling
instate.
if
you
had
followed,
if
you
had
done
what
west
virginia
did
both
would
have
paid
the
2%
tax
without
any
credit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
because
there's
another
tax
in
additional
to
generating
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
state
have
come
our
about
the
same
and
would
you
agree
that
it
would
have
been
constitutional
to
do
it
this
way,
to
impose
the
2%
generation
tax
on
both
the
instate
and
out
of
state
sellers
and
to
reduce
the
gross
receipts
tax
across
the
board
to
2%,
that
would
have
been
constitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
dollars
would
probably
come
out
about
the
same
to,
isn't?
