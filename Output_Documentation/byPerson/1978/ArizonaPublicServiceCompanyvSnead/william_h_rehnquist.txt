william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
look
at
the
overall
effect
of
the
tax,
the
tax
structure
of
new
mexico,
new
mexico
consumers
of
electricity
may
well
pay
just
as
much
as
consumers
in
other
states,
isn't
that
true?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
wholesale
level,
you
mean
sales
by
the
generator
to
others
who
in
turn
sell
at
retail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
the
opinions
below
indicate
how
substantial
a
portion
of
the
total
business,
the
wholesaling
of
electricity
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
a
state
cannot
make
the
generation
of
electricity
a
taxable
event?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
indicate
whether
arizona
public
service
sells
it
retail
any
of
its
electricity
in
new
mexico?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
is
your
position
basically
that
new
mexico's
tax
is
not
all
that
different
from
the
used
tax
that
states
devised
in
the
1930's
to
make
up
for
a
lost
revenue
in
the
situation
if
they
couldn't
get
by
sales
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
make
some
difference
in
this
case
whether
the
business
of
generating
and
selling
electrical
energy
is
setup
like
the
grocery
business
where
you
have
three
levels,
manufacture
at
least
--
manufacture,
wholesale
and
retail
or
whether
there
is
some
difference
between
the
two?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
my
thought
is
that
our
cases
have
said
that
the
practicalities
influence
a
great
deal
whether
a
tax
is
discriminatory
or
not
and
who
bears
the
burden
and
that's
sort
of
a
thing.
and
if
in
fact
the
concept
of
someone
who
wholesales
electricity
does
not
loom
large
in
the
business
of
the
generation,
distribution
of
electrical
energy,
it
--
does
that
--
should
that
play
any
part
in
our
decision
as
compared
to
a
situation
where
there
are
three
identifiable
tiers,
a
manufacturer
or
wholesaler
and
retailer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
rea
in
your
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
do
they
sell
wholesale
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
wholesaler
argument
that
you
are
making
now
made
to
the
new
mexico's
supreme
court?
