mr.
jan
e.
unna
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
heart
of
this
case
is
in
two
issues,
the
tax
reform
act,
section
391
and
in
the
constitutional
case
law.
i
want
to
discuss
the
constitutional
case
law
first
and
then
turn
to
the
tax
reform
act
provision.
in
discussing
first,
the
constitutional
case
law,
i
want
to
weave
it
in
with
the
actual
operation
of
the
tax
to
show
why
new
mexico's
tax
restructuring
with
its
electrical
energy
tax
act
is
clearly
non-discriminatory
under
the
case
law
from
this
court.
before
the
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes
and
i
think
the
statue
is
the
more
important
issue
really.
before
the
electrical
energy
tax
act,
which
established
this
generation
tax
and
the
tax
credit
was
enacted,
the
tax
on
electricity
generated
in
new
mexico,
but
sent
elsewhere
to
southern
california
and
arizona
was
zero.
there
was
no
tax
burden
whatsoever
on
electricity
generated
and
consumed
or
sent
outside
the
state.
there
was
however
a
local
tax,
a
gross
receipts
over
sales
tax
on
electricity
sold
in
new
mexico,
a
4%
gross
receipts
tax.
so
that
if
i
use
arizona
public
service
one
of
the
generators
and
sellers
of
electricity
elsewhere
and
export
of
electricity
from
new
mexico
compare
that
with
public
service
company
which
is
the
largest
generator
and
retailer
of
electricity
in
the
state,
compare
their
burdens
for
ease
of
comparison
for
illustration
purposes.
arizona
public
service
was
subject
to
absolutely
no
tax
burden
before
this
generation
tax
was
passed.
public
service
company
of
new
mexico
however
was
subject
to
a
4%
burden.
then
we
have
the
generation
tax
passed
in
1975
with
the
credit
at
four-tenths
of
a
mil
per
kilowatt
hour,
which
works
out
to
a
2%,
approximately
a
2%
tax.
after
the
electrical
energy
tax
act,
we
have
arizona
public
service
now
subject
to
a
2%
tax
burden,
generation
tax
burden,
no
gross
receipts
tax
burden,
because
it
doesn't
sell
its
electricity
in
new
mexico.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
the
burden
on
electricity
per
se
was
zero.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
and
for
purposes
at
least
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
the
commodity
of
electricity
as
it's
referred
to
in
the
case
law.
after
the
electrical
energy
tax
act
is
passed,
we
have
public
service
now
subject
to
a
2%
generation
tax
burden
also,
but
it
is
allowed
to
credit
this
2%
burden
against
its
4%
gross
receipts
tax
liability.
so
that
its
total
burden
is
4%
that
is
2%
generation
tax
burden
and
4%
gross
receipt
tax
minus
2%
generation
tax
producing
a
total
burden
of
4%.
so
the
instate
burden,
i'm
referring
to,
instate
meaning
electricity
generated,
but
consumed
in
new
mexico,
the
instate
burden
is
4%,
the
out
of
state
burden
is
2%.
obviously
the
burden
on
electricity,
the
instate
electricity
is
greater
than
on
the
outer
state
electricity.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
all
generators
in
new
mexico
pay
the
tax,
but
it
is
not
true
that
the
tax
is
applied
only
to
out
of
state
electricity
that
is
electricity
generated
in
new
mexico
moving
outside
the
state.
public
service
company
and
everybody
in
new
mexico
pays
the
tax
as
well.
they
simply
are
allowed
to
credit
that
energy
tax,
the
generation
tax
against
their
gross
receipts
tax
liability.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
a
minor
portion
is
sold
to
the
companies
that
mines
coal
at
the
four
corners
power
plant
and
it's
a
minuscule
amount
and
basically
i
think
that's
all
they
sell
in
new
mexico.
all
this
electricity
from
the
four
corners
plant
in
san
juan
generating
station
is
two
plants
is
north
west
new
mexico,
all
of
that
basically
moves
outside
the
state,
except
for
public
service
company,
new
mexico
and
el
paso
electric
those
are
two
generators
who
also
sell
electricity
in
new
mexico.
there
is
a
small
portion
of
it.
let
me
give
the
court
three
hypotheticals,
which
will
i
hope
illustrate
the
non-discriminatory
aspect
of
the
tax.
in
the
first
hypothetical,
assume
a
state
has
a
2%
generation
tax
and
no
other
taxes
on
electricity
per
se
and
that's
obviously
non-discriminatory
because
the
2%
tax
applies
to
all
electricity,
no
matter
where
it's
sold.
in
the
second
example,
assume
that
the
state
later
imposes
a
sales
tax
of
2%,
a
flat
2%.
the
total
tax
burden
on
instate
electricity
would
then
be
4%
and
the
total
tax
burden
on
out
of
state
electricity
would
be
2%,
only
the
2%
generation
tax.
obviously,
again
the
burden
is
greater
on
instate
electricity
than
on
out
of
state
electricity
and
it's
non-discriminatory.
in
the
third
example,
assume
that
the
state
had
only
a
sales
tax
and
no
generation
tax.
it
later
decides
to
add
a
generation
tax,
but
does
not
want
to
raise
the
total
tax
burden
for
instate
electricity,
so
it
allows
that
2%
generation
tax
to
be
credited
against
its
sales
tax
and
this
is
not
hypothetical
at
all,
this
is
actually
new
mexico's
situation.
the
total
tax
burden
on
instate
electricity
is
still
4%
and
the
total
tax
burden
on
electrify
generated,
but
marketed
and
sold
elsewhere
is
still
2%
and
the
burden
is
greater
on
instate.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
under
the
constitutional
case
law
that's
not
relevant,
on
my
reading
of
it
anyway.
the
inquiry
is
to
a
state's
tax
structure
ends
at
the
borders
of
the
state
that
you
are
looking
at
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
what?
mr.
jan
e.
unna
of
course
a
light
burden
of
such.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
your
honor
it's
not
true.
all
generators
pay
the
tax.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
they
get
the
credit
against
their
gross
receipts.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
but
they
pay
a
higher
tax.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
not
from
new
mexico
there
is
no
way
we
could
give
it
back.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well,
they
may
get
it
from
arizona
i
don't
know.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
you
haven't.
the
net
effect
of
it
is
true,
but
it's
easy
to
slide
over
the
fact
that
instate
generators
do
actually
pay
this
tax,
the
generation
tax.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
then
the
total
tax
burden
under
constitutional
case
law
is
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
on
the
commodity
of
electricity.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
i'm
not
sure
that
the
case
law
says
that
you
couldn't
add
up
the
total
tax
burden
on
different
tax
payers
so
long
as
it's
on
the
commodity
of
electricity.
you
don't
have
to
have
one
single
as
i
read
public
utilities
district
number
2,
the
73
case
alaska
versus
arctic
maid,
involving
fishing
in
local
canneries,
it
doesn't
say
that
you
have
to
have
one
tax
payer
and
compare
the
burden
on
one
tax
payer.
you
add
up
to
total
tax
burden
on
the
commodity
is,
in
alaska
versus
arctic
maid
as
61
case
it
was
fish,
local
canneries
versus
one
other
state
or
interstate
transaction.
you
don't
have
to
have
just
one
tax
payer.
as
far
as
the
record
goes
here
with
respect
to
wholesale
sales
however,
there
is
no
factual
record,
for
example
that
there
is
any
instate
generator
like
public
service
company
that
even
makes
a
wholesale
sale.
as
far
as
what
is
being
argued
by
the
other
side
is
that's
basically
an
after
thought,
because
the
record
has
no
facts
even
to
show
that
there
is
even
a
wholesale.
i
presume,
i
don't
have
the
facts
either,
but
there
are
-–
mr.
jan
e.
unna
of
the
electricity?
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
i
think
that
the
way
we
have
a
tax
structure
that
we
have
is
–-
mr.
jan
e.
unna
the
way
we
have
your
honor.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
we
have
no
control
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well,
arizona
is
free
to
do
whatever
it
wants
to
but
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well,
under
the
constitution
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
the
total
tax
burden
on
electricity
is
4%
interstate,
the
total
tax
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
i
am
sorry.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
the
tax
burden
on
instate
electricity
that's
sold
in
new
mexico
is
twice
the
burden
on
electricity
that
is
generated
and
sold
in
arizona.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
i
see
what
was
your
question
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
he
pays
more
your
honor.
he
pays
a
2%
generation
tax
and
he
pays
in
effect
2%
gross
receipts
tax
and
that's
4%,
yes
he
does.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes
your
honor
but
he
gets
it
back
against
his
sales
tax
reverse
receipts
tax
which
he
also
pays,
that's
a
4%
tax
rate.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well,
there
is
no
factual
record
your
honor.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
i'm
taking
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
what
your
honor?
mr.
jan
e.
unna
a
sale
by
a
new
mexico
generator
is
not
subject
to
the
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
it's
not
correct,
i
think
the
net
result
of,
for
purposes
of
the
constitutional
case
law
is
that
a
higher
tax
is
paid
on
instant
electricity.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
alright.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
your
honor,
it's
doesn't.
the
electricity
generated
in
new
mexico
and
sent
to
arizona
pays
the
2%
generation
tax.
electricity
generated
in
new
mexico
and
consumed
in
new
mexico
pays
the
2%
generation
tax.
that
2%
generation
tax
is
then
credited
against
the
4%
gross
receipts
tax.
so
that
ultimately
the
total
burden
on
instate
electricity
is
4%,
the
total
burden
on
outer
state
electricity
is
2%
and
under
the
constitutional
case
law
that
and
equivalence
of
the
taxation
rule
under
the
public
utilities
district
number
2
case,
alaska
versus
arctic
maid
and
the
south
carolina
power
case,
the
relevant
inquiry
is
at
the
borders,
stops
at
the
borders
of
the
state
that
you
are
looking
at.
you
don't
waive
sister
state
burdens
into
the
equation.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
that's
true.
there
is
an
additional
burden
as
a
result
of
the
electrical
energy
tax
act
and
that
additional
burden
isn't
shared
by
instate
electricity.
the
instate
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
that's
right.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
there
is
additional
tax
burden
that's
not
shared
by
instate
electricity,
but
the
relevant
--
that
is
not
the
test
under
the
constitutional
case
law.
that
constitutional
case
law
test
is
whether
there
is
a
greater
tax
burden
on
the
outer
electricity
than
on
the
instate
electricity
and
the
out
of
state
electricity
has
moved
basically
from
0
to
2%,
they
weren't
paying
any
tax
before.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
that's
basically
it,
yes.
in
those
cases
those
are
equivalent
taxes
of
4%
use
tax
and
4%
sales
tax.
here
the
tax
burden
is
even
greater
on
instate
electricity;
it's
4%
versus
2%.
the
equivalents
of
taxation
rule
allows
the
state
to
do
exactly
what
new
mexico
has
done
in
restructuring
it's
taxation
with
respect
to
electricity.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
your
honor
the
case
law
is
very
clear.
you
are
not
look
at
as
i
read
the
cases
one
is
not
to
look
at
the
tax
in
isolation,
one
is
to
add
up
the
total
tax
burden.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well,
if
you
look
solely
at
the
tax
burden
on
a
generator
and
a
wholesaler.
all
generators,
wholesalers
pay
the
tax,
the
instate
generator
and
wholesaler
actually
pays
the
tax
too.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
--
he
doesn't
pay
it.
he
doesn't
pay
it
and
you
can
look
around
all
you
want
to
and
he
doesn't
pay
gross
receipts
tax.
but
he
does,
he
actually
pays
it,
but
then
gets
a
credit
on
an
even
higher
tax
for
instate
electricity.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
not
in
our
state
your
honor.
it's
imposed
on
the
same
public
service
company
or
the
retailer
of
electricity,
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
seller
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
of
the
gross
receipts,
no,
that's
true.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
there
is
any
wholesale
selling
of
electricities.
most
of
it,
i
submit
from
my
experience
as
a
consumer
in
new
mexico
is
well
is
not
in
the
paper
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
mostly
electricity
where
i
come
from
is
sold
by
public
service
company,
new
mexico.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
what
about
it?
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well,
the
only
purpose
of
the
mandatory
credit
in
the
forgiveness
of
paying
back
of
the
generation
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
he
paid
the
generation
tax.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
he
would
get
it
back
against
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
that's,
that's
speculative.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
is
such
a
person.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
but
the
record
is
silent,
it
wasn't
a
point
that
was
developed
by
the
utilities
in
this
case.
it
was
never
tried
to
the
lower
court
to
the
trail
court,
but
the
case
wasn't
tried,
but
the
case
was
submitted
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
but
there
is
no
factual
information
on
a
discrimination
against
wholesalers.
to
me,
my
way
of
thinking
would
be
the
argument
about
discrimination
against
wholesalers
assumes
the
very
proposition
of
discrimination
that
we
are
arguing
about
because
they
would
have
you
assume
that
the
tax
burden
on
instate
generators
is
zero
and
there
is
still
a
4%
gross
receipts
tax
burden
that's
not
the
case.
the
tax
burden
on
instate
generators
is
in
fact
still
2%.
there
is
an
equivalent
tax
burden
on
generators
and
then
we
then
have
in
effect
only
lowered
our
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
the
out-of-state?
mr.
jan
e.
unna
he
can't
get
back
from
new
mexico.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
aimed
at
invalidating
new
mexico's
tax
and
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
i
don't
know
that
the
senate
finance
--
the
senate
finance
committee
version,
there
was
a
great
difference
i
think
in,
well
not
a
great
difference,
there
was
difference
between
the
senate
finance
committee
version
and
the
greater
tax
burden
version.
in
my
view
the
proponents
of
the
test
had
problems
in
that
they
couldn't
invalidate
west
virginia's
tax
structure
with
respect
to
electricity
or
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
and
they
would
have
lost
their
whole
test
of
discrimination
to
invalidate
new
mexico's
tax.
if
they
would
have
heard
washington,
west
virginia
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
i
think
they
had
to
water
down
the
tests
so
substantially
however,
that
it
resulted
in
a
restatement
of
the
case
law
and
the
test
of
discrimination
in
the
second
part
of
section
391,
i
think
makes
that
very
clear.
it
speaks
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
of
course
if
it's
a
restatement
then
our
tax
is
constitutional
and
if
it's
a
restatement
under
the
constitutional
case
law
there
is
no
question
that
new
mexico's
tax
structure
would
survive
in
time.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
i
don't
quite
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well,
i
think
that
wholesaling
doesn't
play
a
large
part
in
the
distribution
of
electricity.
they
are
in
the
record
in
response
to
our
interrogatory.
there
is
--
there
is
some
--
are
some
answers
about
wholesaling
of
electricity
amongst
the
plaintiffs
and
amongst
instate
utilities,
but
those
were
economy
interchanges
simply
one,
one
utility
is
--
gets
low
and
needs
more
electricity
it
takes
some
more
of
one
of
the
others
as
part
of
the,
in
part
of
the
power
pool,
but
there
is
no
record
here
basically
on
wholesaling
of
electricity
and
to
my
knowledge
basically
we
have
instate
generators
who
also
retail
and
so
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
we
don't
in
my
knowledge.
there
are
some
federal
power
lines
but
not
--
the
rea
to
my
knowledge
is
not
in
our
state.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
i
have
not
argued
a
constitutional,
a
case
law
discrimination
been
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
we
have
argued
that
consistently
the
utilities
raised
below
at
the
trail
level
that
their
rights,
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
rights
were
being
violated
by
this
tax
which
raised
a
question.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
sure.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
oh,
yes.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
i'm
not
saying
we
can
discriminate
because
there
is
so
much
pollution
there.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well,
to
show
annexes
with
the
taxing
state
that
there
were
a
tremendous
amount
of
costs
and
benefits
to
the
utilities
as
a
result
of
having
their
plants
in
the
north
west
corner
of
new
mexico,
just
to
set
the
case
in
context.
it
was
submitted
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
we
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
was
well
established
at
the
trail
level
that
there
was
nexus
sufficient
for
taxing
purposes.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no,
your
are
correct.
the
west
virginian,
it's
a
tax
on
the
gross
proceeds
of
electricity.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
which
and
there
was
fear
that
the
senate
finance
committee
version
of
higher
gross
in
that
tax
would
sweep
up
west
virginia's
tax
and
incur
the
wrath
senate
burden
and
so
on.
the
tax
then
was
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well,
now
i
think
the
fear
was
simply
using
the
word
gross.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
gross,
it
would
have
up
swept
up
gross
proceeds
tax.
it
would
have
set
the
burden
is
higher.
the
test
was
significantly
changed
though
to
put
in
the
greater
tax
burden
language
on
electricity
and
that's
straight
out
of
the
case
law,
that's
the
case
law
test.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
yes,
but
the
higher
gross
or
net
tax
language
seem
to
focus
on
a
credit
situation
such
as
new
mexico's
and
look
at
a
generation
tax
in
isolation
and
then
when
that
language
has
abandoned,
higher
gross
or
net
tax,
you
go,
we
move
to
straight
to
the
greater
tax
burden
test
which
is
precisely
the
constitutional
test
and
that's
why
i
say
it's
a
restatement.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yes,
i
think
west
virginia
had
a
tax
on
the
different
level
of
distribution
but
under
the
total
tax
burden
test
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference
and
so
i
think
i'm
not
sure
also
i'm
not
familiar
with
west
virginia's
tax
situation
exactly
but
i
think
the
rate
of
taxes
for
the
two
different
plants
were
slightly
different
your
honor.
i
think
that
instate
burden
was
greater
than
that
is
using
your
two
plants
example
the
one
plant
producing
instate
electricity
would
have
been
at
a
higher
tax
burden
than
the
one
going
outside
the
state.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
yeah
there
were
--
i
think
there
were
two
tax
statutes
there
involved
but
that's
also
our
case
in
that
sense.
the
difference
between
the
senate
finance
committee
version
and
the
final
form
of
the
test,
the
greater
tax
burden
test
is
significant
because
that's
the
operative's
test
of
discrimination
under
section
391
and
if
you've
changed
the
test
of
the
discrimination
you've
changed
the
whole
ballgame
as
far
as
discrimination
goes.
so,
it
is
also
important
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
391
that
nowhere
does
it
repudiate
the
constitutional
case
law
test
of
discrimination,
so
we
end
up
with
two
tests
of
discrimination
existing
side
by
side
supposedly
one
in
391
is
a
new
test
but
its
language
is
couched
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
case
law
test.
moreover
it
doesn't
repudiate
the
constitutional
case
law
test.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
it's
still
a
legislation
your
honor,
but
that's
all
politically
the
utilities
were
able
to
accomplish
them
and
that's
set
forth
clearly
i
think
in
pages
85
through
88
of
the
appendix
where
arizona
public
services
council
writes
directly
to
senator
fannin
proposing
the
greater
tax
burden
test
to
get
around
west
virginia
and
the
strategy
is
made
very
clear
at
the
end
of
page
88
and
he
says,
finally
its
imperative
that
a
clear
legislative
history
be
made,
without
it
we
could
dream
up
another
dozen
arguments.
so
they
knew
that
they
had
innocuous
test
basically
that
restated
the
case
law
and
so
they
wanted
to
make
legislative
history.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
no
there
is
legislative
history
about
the
discriminatory
nature
of
new
mexico's
tax.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
i
think
basically
that's
all
we
have
and
i
think
that's
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
well
it
was
so
clear
but
it
related
to
a
different
test
of
discrimination
your
honor,
it
related
to
higher
gross
or
net
tax
that's
a
substantially
different.
mr.
jan
e.
unna
the
senate
finance
committee
--
mr.
jan
e.
unna
the
test
was
changed
and
none
of
the
official
legislative
history
relates
to
the
second
test,
the
greater
tax
burden
test
and
that's
the
crucial
test
that
we
have
here.
so,
all
of
the
legislative
history
is
irrelevant
to
the
final
test
that
was
enacted.
thank
you.
