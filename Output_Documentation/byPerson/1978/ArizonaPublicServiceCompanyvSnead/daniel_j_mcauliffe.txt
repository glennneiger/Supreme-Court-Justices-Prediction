mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
not
contended
to
present
separately
the
underlying
facts
of
this
proceeding
nor
a
description
of
the
proceedings
which
bring
us
here,
except
those
maybe
pertinent
to
argument
or
to
questions
from
the
court.
i
would
be
happy
to
state
the
facts
separately
if
the
court
so
desires,
otherwise
i
will
proceed
with
the
argument.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
i
believe
that
they
are
adequately
set
forth
in
the
briefs.
essentially
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court,
this
is
a
discrimination
case.
it
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
mexico
electrical
energy
tax
act.
let
me
explain
initially
exactly
how
that
energy
tax
act
operates
and
i
think
you
will
understand
the
discriminatory
operation
of
the
tax.
section
3
of
the
tax
purports
to
impose
a
levy
on
the
generation
of
electricity
generated
in
new
mexico
for
the
states
that
is
on
the
privilege
of
generating
electricity
for
sale.
while
that
appears
even
handed,
section
9
of
the
act
significantly
affects
the
way
that
tax
operates.
section
9
is
the
credit
provision
and
the
two
pertinent
provisions
we
believe
are
sections
9(b)
and
(c).
section
9(b)
provides
that
a
generator
who
produces
electricity
in
new
mexico
which
will
be
consumed
in
new
mexico
may
take
energy
tax
that’s
imposed
and
credit
it
against
a
gross
receipts
tax
liability,
which
it
will
incur
upon
the
retail
sale
of
the
electricity.
again,
that
credit
provision,
section
9(b),
is
available
and
applies
only
if
the
electricity
is
generated
and
consumed
in
new
mexico.
section
9(c)
deals
with
a
separate
situation,
because
if
you
look
at
the
wholesaler
of
electricity,
the
local
generator
for
example,
who
will
sell
the
electricity
initially
for
resale,
the
section
9(b)
credit
is
of
no
assistance
to
that
entity.
the
simple
reason
that
the
gross
receipts
tax
does
not
apply
to
a
sale
for
resale
at
the
wholesale
level.
as
a
result,
there
is
no
gross
receipts
tax
liability
against
which
to
credit
the
energy
tax
assessment.
section
9(c)
takes
care
of
that
situation.
indeed
it
was
included
in
the
act
specifically
to
take
care
of
that
situation.
what
section
9(c)
provides
is
that
the
credit
granted
by
section
9
will
be
assigned
forward
by
the
wholesale
seller
which
for
purposes
of
argument
i
will
call
the
generator,
generally
is
–
because
there
is
some
confusion
generated
when
you
try
and
describe
both
parties
of
that
transaction,
the
generator
is
normally
the
seller
in
the
wholesale
transaction.
the
generator
assigns
that
credit
forward
to
the
purchaser
in
the
wholesale
transaction
who
is
generally
the
retail
seller.
in
exchange
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
the
credit
is
assigned
for;
it’s
only
with
respect
to
electricity
that
will
be
consumed
in
new
mexico.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
he
may.
again
the
section
9(c)
credit
though
will
be
limited
to
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
to
just
the
one,
where
the
electricity
is
eventually
consumed
in
new
mexico.
in
exchange
for
the
assignment
forward
of
that
credit,
the
generator
will
eventually
receive
a
monetary
reimbursement
from
the
retailer
in
the
amount
of
any
credit
actually
received
by
application
against
the
gross
receipts
tax
liability
of
the
retailer.
the
net
effect
of
these
provisions
throughout
the
course
of
this
litigation
has
been
undisputed.
the
energy
tax
applies
only
to
electricity,
which
is
generated
in
new
mexico
and
transmitted
to
other
states
for
retail
sale
and
consumption.
it
collects
no
revenue
whatsoever
from
electricity
which
is
generated
and
consumed
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
we
contend
that
tax
is
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
at
the
consumer
level,
i
am
not
sure
that
that's
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
then
you
are
talking
into
account
whatever
tax
maybe
applied
at
the
consumption
level
and
the
state
of
consumption.
new
mexico
consumers
pay
a
total
tax
or
the
total
tax
if
you
take
it
all
the
way
down
to
the
level
of
consumption
in
new
mexico
is
a
4%
gross
receipts
tax
imposed
by
the
state.
and
when
we
get
to
the
constitutional
argument,
our
position
is
that
--
the
state's
position
is
obviously
that
saves
the
energy
tax,
but
our
position
is
that
even
when
you
look
at
the
whole
scheme
of
taxation,
looking
at
the
treatment
of
wholesalers
you
do
not
have
that
equality
of
treatment.
you
have
a
facial
equivalence
looking
at
the
scheme
as
a
whole,
but
at
the
wholesale
level
there
is
no
new
mexico
tax.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
sell
for
retail,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
initial
aspect
of
the
discrimination
issue
is
that
which
involves
the
tax
reform
act
of
1976
which
was
passed
during
pendency
of
this
litigation,
we
have
particular
reference
to
section
2121(a)
which
is
codified
as
title
15,
united
states
code,
section
391.
that
statute
provides
in
effect
that
no
state
may
impose
a
tax
on
or
with
respect
to
the
generation
or
transmission
of
electricity
which
discriminates
against
out
of
state
producers,
generators,
wholesales,
retailers
or
consumers.
the
statute
also
defines
what
is
discriminatory
and
that
is,
if
it
imposes
a
greater
tax
burden
on
electricity
whether
directly
or
indirectly
on
electricity,
which
is
generated
and
transmitted
in
the
interstate
commerce.
we
believe
that
the
new
mexico
electrical
energy
tax
clearly
satisfies
that
definition.
there
has
never
been
any
dispute
that
it
is
a
tax
on
or
with
respect
to
the
generation
or
transmission
of
electricity
and
it
is
discriminatory.
it
imposes
a
greater
tax
burden
on
electricity
which
is
generated
and
transmitted
to
other
states,
states
outside
of
new
mexico
that
has
never
been
disputed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
we
believe
confirms
that.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
yes
it
does
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
well,
it
was
not
really
amended
the
--
let
me
explain
the
course
of
the
legislative
history.
there
was
a
provision
in
the
senate
finance
committee,
which
was
reported
to
the
senate
floor
and
passed
by
the
senate.
this
was
the
provision
that
senate
have
managed
to
move
to
strike
in
its
entirety.
and
that
said
that
--
and
if
the
state
imposed
a
higher
gross
or
net
tax
on
electricity
then
it
would
be,
that
was
the
statutory
definition
of
discrimination
with
that
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
we
have
no
legislative
record
of
that
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
don't
believe
the
state's
briefs
cites
anything
in
the
legislative
record
to
support
that
contention.
there
was
a
bill
introduced
approximately
a
year
before
the
tax
reform
act,
which
would
have
stricken
down
all
state
generation
taxes.
there
was
a
hearing
held
on
that
bill
in
march
of
1976
and
representatives
from
the
states
of
west
virginia
and
washington
appeared
and
questioned
whether
–-
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
the
reference
they
used
in
the
hearings
was
this
is
an
over
reaction
to
the
specific
situation
in
arizona
and
new
mexico,
it
goes
too
far.
you
are
not
just
striking
the
discriminatory
taxes.
that
bill
we
have
no
idea
what
happened
to
it.
we
then
pick
up
a
separate
legislative
history
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
it
was
not
enacted;
let
me
get
to
the
tax
reform
act.
now
the
change
which
was
made
was
when
the
different
versions
passed
by
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
went
to
a
conference
committee
and
the
conference
committee
changed
the
language
to
its
present
formulation.
the
conference
committee
report
both
in
the
house
and
the
senate
says
that
it
is
adopting
the
senate
amendment.
there
is
no
other
explanation
for
the
change
and
i
think
without
inquiry
and
speculation
of
the
legislative
record,
we
are
entitled
to
assume
that
they
adopted
the
intent
of
the
senate
as
well
and
the
intent
of
the
senate
at
least
is
reflected
in
debate
was
quite
clear.
the
senate
finance
committee
describes
the
type
of
tax
they
are
talking
about
and
it
describes
on
all
force
the
electrical
energy
tax
that
was
stated
in
new
mexico.
senator
domenici
appeared
at
the
time
the
bill
was
introduced
for
debate
and
moved
to
strike
in
its
entirety
and
the
exchange
between
he
and
senator
fannin
and
senator
goldwater
makes
perfectly
clear
that
what
his
concern
was
that
this
would
reach
the
new
mexico
tax
and
senator
domenici's
amendment
was
defeated.
so
we
think
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
on
that
one
point.
the
lower
court
in
affect,
we
believe
disregarded
this
statute
and
said
that
it
incorporated
a
constitutional
test.
we
submit
that's
a
very
strange
reading
of
it.
the
statute
refers
to
not
only
a
tax,
it
refers
to
a
particular
class
of
taxes,
a
tax
on
or
with
respect
to
the
generation
or
transmission
of
electricity.
as
i
turn
then
to
the
constitutional
argument,
again,
the
energy
tax
as
we've
described
is
discriminatory
in
its
actual
operation.
the
state
contends
that
although
the
impact
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
i
don't
know,
but
we
say
we
rely
anymore
on
one
sentence
than
the
other
because
the
first
sentence
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
according
to
the
state
of
residence,
they're
out-of-state,
but
the
statute
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
we
would
rely
on
the
second
--
the
second
sentence
contains
the
test
of
discrimination
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
well,
the
first
sentence
says
that
no
state
shall
discriminate
which
is
in
a
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
i
don't
know,
the
statute
doesn't
define
what
an
out-of-state
producer
is.
i
would
argue
that
it
refers
to
a
producer
who
is
producing
electricity
principally
for
consumption
out-of-state.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
there
are
out-of-state
manufacturers
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
i
will
review
it
mr.
justice
stevens.
turning
then
to
the
constitutional
argument,
the
state's
defense
of
the
statute
is
that
you
can't
view
the
energy
tax
in
isolation
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
state's
entire
scheme
of
taxation.
even
adopting
that
as
the
constitutional
test,
it
does
not
save
the
energy
tax,
because
we
believe
that
test
involves
considerably
more
than
simply
looking
at
tax
incidences
and
tax
rates
and
discovering
whether
there
is
some
glaring
in
equality.
if
that
were
the
analysis
and
that
is
the
analysis
the
state
employs,
then
the
halliburton
case
would
have
been
decided
differently,
because
in
the
halliburton
case
there
was
facial
tax
equivalence
between
the
sales
tax
and
the
used
tax.
the
difficulty
in
halliburton
was
that
one
component
of
that
facially
equivalent
tax
structure
affected
a
class
of
taxpayers
differently
depending
upon
whether
they
were
involved
in
the
interstate
commerce
or
not
that
is
exactly
what
happens
here
when
you
look
at
the
wholesale
transaction.
again,
if
the
wholesaler
sells
that
electricity
for
consumption
in
new
mexico,
it
will
eventually
receive
a
tax,
a
private
tax
rebate
from
the
retail
seller
in
the
amount
of
any
credit
actually
received
which
will
wholly
erase
any
energy
tax
liability.
the
interstate
wholesaler,
the
wholesaler
who
markets
that
electricity
which
is
consumed
in
other
states
receives
no
such
credits
and
pays
the
energy
tax.
in
effect,
the
interstate
transaction
is
taxed;
the
intrastate
transaction
is
tax
free.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
they
do
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
opinions
below
do
not
address
the
issue
of
discrimination
as
wholesalers
at
all.
in
the
appendix
and
our
answers
to
the
bureau
of
revenues'
interrogatories
reading
them
together
with
the
affidavits
which
were
submitted
in
connection
with
our
initial
motion
for
summary
judgment,
you'll
find
the
most
complete
figures
available
after
1974
and
they
are
only
partial,
they
do
not
include
figures
for
southern
california
edison.
they
indicate
that
our
purchases
of
wholesale
of
electricity
were
approximately
four
and
a
half
million
kilowatt
hours
of
electricity
and
our
sales
of
electricity
were
approximately
--
at
the
wholesale
level
were
approximately
7.5
million
kilowatt
hours
for
a
total
of
1.2
billion
kilowatt
hours
of
electricity.
that
is
roughly
10
to
12%
of
the
total
electricity
generated
by
us
in
new
mexico
that's
the
approximate
volume
of
it.
it's
of
course
going
to
fluctuate
year-by-year
depending
upon
demand
and
whether
particular
facilities
are
online
or
offline,
but
i
think
that's
a
fair
rough
approximation.
under
the
halliburton
case,
the
test
is
whether
the
component
tax
provides
equal
treatment
to
in-state
and
out
of
state
taxpayers
similarly
situated.
we
contend
that
this
tax
does
not.
when
you
compare
the
situation
of
the
wholesaler
who
sells
intrastate
with
the
situation
of
the
wholesaler
who
sells
interstate,
there's
no
evenhanded
treatment.
they
are
subject
to
disparate
burdens
and
that
is
discriminatory
and
although
there
has
been
a
significant
change
in
recent
years,
a
reformulation
of
the
test
which
this
court
will
apply
to
state
taxation
and
interstate
commerce
that
principle
remains
unchanged
and
that
is
that
a
state
tax
may
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
we
also
contend
that
this
tax
imposes
undue
burdens
upon
interstate
commerce.
the
state's
response
to
this
is
that
the
tax
cannot
impose
an
undue
or
what
used
to
be
called
a
multiple
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
because
it
only
applies
to
the
active
generation,
which
only
happens
in
new
mexico,
we
contend
that
is
a
fiction.
as
a
practical
matter,
you
cannot
--
at
the
time
electricity
is
generated
in
new
mexico,
under
the
state's
own
regulations
it
is
subject
to
a
potential
credit
whether
that
credit,
the
potential
credit
becomes
actual
or
whether
it
vanishes
depends
upon
a
subsequent
determination
as
to
the
state
of
consumption.
at
the
time
that
that
determination
is
made
that
electricity
is
already
in
the
transmission
pipeline,
if
you
will,
traveling
at
the
speed
of
light.
the
tax
is
whether
it's
phrased
a
tax
on
sale
or
a
tax
on
consumption,
liability
for
that
tax,
assessment
of
the
amount
of
that
tax
that
is
due
cannot
be
made
at
the
point
of
generation.
it
can
only
be
made
at
the
time
that
this,
that
is
determined
whether
that
tax
is
consumed.
so
we
contend
that
the
tax
is
perfectly
analogous
to
the
tax
of
michigan
wisconsin
pipeline
versus
calvert.
there
the
tax
was
imposed
on
the
taking
of
gas,
taking
of
natural
gas
and
the
principle
vice
of
the
tax
was
that
it
was
imposed
on
the
entire
volume
of
gas
taken.
this
court
has
sensibly
held
that
the
vice
there
was
on
a
portion
to
activities
within
the
state.
this
is
exactly
the
same
tax.
this
is
a
privilege
tax.
this
is
the
tax
in
what
michigan
wisconsin
was.
this
is
a
tax
which
is
imposed
on
the
entire
volume
of
gasoline
that
is
taken,
the
entire
volume
of
electricity
taken
outside
of
the
state.
this
is
just
as
much
a
tax
on
the
exit
from
the
borders
of
new
mexico
of
electricity
as
was
the
tax
in
michigan
wisconsin.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
no,
i'm
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
tax
does
not
do
that
because
this
tax
if
--
this
tax
does
not
impose
a
levy
on
all
generation
of
electricity
and
because
it
credits
or
exempts
certain
generation,
you
cannot
determine
whether
you're
liable
for
this
tax
until
something
after
generation
happens.
it
has
to
be
transformed
and
transmitted
and
the
place
of
consumption
determined
before
you
know
whether
this
tax
is
due.
a
straightforward
generation
tax
such
as
was
involved
in
utah
power
&
light,
it
can
be
determined
at
the
point
of
generation
whether
that
tax
has
to
be
paid,
it
can't
be
done
here.
the
state
of
new
mexico's
bureau
of
revenue
concedes
that.
one
of
its
regulations
that
says
that
energy
that's
generated
at
that
point
in
time
are
subject
to
a
potential
credit.
the
act
doesn't
refer
to
any
such
potential
credit
concept,
but
if
you're
going
to
straightforwardly
apply
this
tax
then
you
have
to
have
a
potential
credit
at
that
point,
because
at
that
point
the
tax
is
potential,
it's
held
in
abeyance
until
such
time
as
you
determine
the
place
of
consumption.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
yes,
it
does
that's
section
9(a).
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
and
that
--
all
that
provides
is
that
if
there
is
a
tax,
a
generation
tax
imposed
by
another
state
and
the
energy
is
transmitted
to
new
mexico
and
consumed
there,
then
you're
entitled
to
take
a
--
if
it's
retailed
in
new
mexico
you
owe
gross
receipts
tax
and
you're
entitled
to
take
a
credit
against
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
it's
whatever
tax
is
imposed
by
the
other
state.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
i
would
assume
so
mr.
justice
stevens
our
position
is
that
obviously
cannot
cure
the
problem.
that
is
the
same
offer
of
reciprocity
that
was
made
in
austin
versus
new
hampshire.
it
is
exactly
the
situation
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with
when
they
passed
the
tax
reform
act
that
what
you
would
be
producing
as
a
taxing
or
between
the
states
over
the
subject
of
electricity.
this
is
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
court
exactly
what
this
court
described
in
the
complete
auto
transit
case
in
the
footnote.
this
is
a
privilege
tax;
it
is
a
tailored
privileged
tax.
it
has
to
be
subjected
to
strict
scrutiny
and
when
it
is,
it
produces
the
affects
which
this
court
has
always
held
are
prohibited
by
the
commerce
clause.
it
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
pure
and
simply
and
it
transgresses
the
provisions
of
the
tax
reform
act
of
1976.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
a
few
very
brief
points.
mr.
justice
blackmun
let
me
clarify
one
thing,
they
do
not
have
those
two
letters
after
the
bill
leaves
the
senate.
those
two
letters
are
both
at
least
a
month
and
half
prior
to
the
debate
on
the
senate
floor,
the
letters
in
the
appendix.
the
state
asks
us
to
entertain
several
assumptions
as
a
basis
for
justifying
the
tax.
the
first
is
that
we
should
assume
that
there
are
no
wholly
intrastate
new
mexico
wholesalers.
the
problem
with
that
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
if
there
are
no
holding
new
mexico
intrastate
wholesalers
then
why
is
section
9
(c)
in
the
act
and
in
our
legislative,
our
treatment
of
the
legislative
history
before
the
state
legislature,
it's
very
clear
which
is
set
forth
in
our
opening
brief
that
what
they
were
concerned
with
was
the
fact
that
an
intrastate
wholesaler,
which
plenty
of
them
exist
could
not
take
advantage
of
the
section
9
(b)
credit.
so,
obviously
the
new
mexico
legislature
was
legislating
to
take
care
of
a
specific
situation
which
did
in
fact
exist.
the
second
assumption
they
ask
us
to
entertain
is
that
new
mexico
has
in
fact
passed
some
different
tax
that
they
have
in
effect
reduced
their
sales
tax
to
2%
and
imposed
the
generation
tax
even
handedly.
i
think
we've
adequately
shown
that
that
is
not
in
fact
what
they've
done
and
we
cannot
save
this
tax
of
by
referring
to
some
hypothetical
tax
which
new
mexico
might
have
enacted
but
concededly
did
not.
the
final
assumption
is
that
the
constitutional
case
law
establishes
an
equivalence
of
tax
rule.
i
think
that
is
an
over
statement
in
–
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
public
service
company
of
new
mexico,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
4%.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
i'm
assuming
that
it
pays
the
gross
receipts
tax
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
pays
it
or
whether
it
just
collects
it
from
the
consumer.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
so
the
fully,
we
are
both
generating
retails,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
that's
correct
2%
energy
tax.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
not
at
that
level,
but
we
are
not
comparable
at
that
level
because
we
don't
retail
in
new
mexico.
you
are
comparing
public
service
of
company
to
new
mexico's
retail
transaction
with
our
wholesale
transaction.
what
we
say
is
that
we
are
wholesalers,
that's
a
significant
segment
of
economic
activity.
public
service
company
in
new
mexico
also
engages
in
the
wholesale
transaction.
at
the
wholesale
level
public
service
company
in
new
mexico
pays
nothing,
it
will
receive
back
if
it
sells
–
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
well,
i
believe
it
sells
to
points
electric,
gnt.
there
is
reference
in
there
in
the
new
mexico
legislative
history
that
there
is
at
least
a
south
west
co-op
which
could
not
recoup
the
entire
energy
tax
liability
as
the
tax
was
initially
formulated.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
i
believe
that's
correct.
it
was
a
wholesaler
or
a
–
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
i
don't
believe
the
record
reflects
that.
i
believe
it
in
the
legislative
history
before
the
new
mexico
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
in
the
legislative
history
before
the
new
mexico
legislature
there
are
references
to
the
fact
that
there
are
new
mexico
intrastate
wholesalers
i
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
yes,
the
transcript
on
this
appeal
will
include
the
legislative
history
before
the
new
mexico
legislature.
we
are
under
discussion
of
the
need
for
the
section
9
(c)
credit.
they
discuss
it
specifically
on
the
basis
that
it
is
necessary
to
save
wholesalers
from
the
impact
of
the
energy
tax,
the
new
mexico
intrastate
wholesalers.
what
is
bothering
me,
at
the
moment
is
memory
does
not
serve
me
as
to
whether
they
identify
particular
intrastate
wholesalers
to
whom
they
are
trying
to
protect.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
not
on
a
wholesale
transaction,
that
is
correct.
gross
receipts
tax
will
not
apply
to
a
wholesale
transaction.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
yes
it
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
it
was
just
not
out
within
in
the
court
below.
that
concludes
the
final,
you
might
you
know
the
final
assumption
which
is
that
we
only
look
at
the
facial
tax
equivalence.
the
rule
is
taxpayers
pay
taxes
and
we
look
at
the
treatment
of
individual
tax
payer
similarly
situated
tax
payers.
that's
what
halliburton
says
and
when
we
look
at
similarly
situated
tax
payers
in
this
case
at
the
wholesale
level
again
under
the
constitutional
test
as
the
state
advocates
it
to
be
this
tax
is
discriminatory.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
i
suppose,
i
have
never
focused
specifically
on
that
question,
i
think
it
would
remove
the
credit
provision
in
the
discriminatory
treatment
of
which
we
complaint
at
the
present
time.
mr.
daniel
j.
mcauliffe
again
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
never
tried
to
cross
that,
i
believe
my
time
has
expired
mr.
chief
justice.
