justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
you
tax
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
you
give
it
back.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
can't
get
the
money
back
from
arizona?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
never
give
the
money
to
arizona?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
couldn't
give
it,
arizona
couldn't
give
it
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
here
i
just
don't
understand

state
free
in

is
a
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall

is
there
a
difference
at
the
end
of
the
year
between
the
electricity
sold
to
arizona
and
electricity
sold
in
new
mexico?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
difference
in
the
tax
paid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
generator
as
i
am
talking
to,

he
pay
less
if
he
sells
his
electricity
in
new
mexico?
justice
thurgood
marshall

true.
