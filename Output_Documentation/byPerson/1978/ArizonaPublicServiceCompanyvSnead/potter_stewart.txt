well
doesn't
the
legislative
history
show
that
federal
law
was
enacted
â€“-
was
this
statute
a
direct
target?
justice
potter
stewart
then
of
course
it
was
amended
and
your
brother
on
the
other
side
claims
that
it
was
during
the
course
it
was
being
amended
it
was
whittled
down
to
being
almost
meaningless
and
not
to
cover
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
couple
of
the
other
states
west
virginia
and
washington
got
disturbed.
justice
potter
stewart
anyway
it
was
not
enacted.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
that
is
not
what
it
says.
that
is
not
what
it
says.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
talk
about
productions
for
sale
out-of-state.
it
seems
to
me,
the
first
sentence
would
apply
to
an
out-of-state
generating
plant
that
was
selling
electricity
into
your
state
and
you
had
higher
tax
on
that
electricity
than
on
locally
produced
electricity
and
that's
not
this
case,
but
the
second
sentence
i
would
say
it
does
read
against.
justice
potter
stewart
and
isn't
it
also
true
that
so
far
as
new
mexico
generators
of
electricity
go,
those
who
generate
or
that
part
of
the
electricity
that
they
generate
that
is
sole
inside
of
new
mexico
is
not
subject
to
any
generation
tax
and
not
part
of
the
electricity
that
the
new
mexico
generators
sell
that
is
sold
outside
of
the
state
is.
justice
potter
stewart
but
those
who
generate
electricity
that
is
sold
in
new
mexico
get
to
get
it
back.
justice
potter
stewart
they
get
it
all
back,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
who
sell
electricity
that
is
in
turn
sold
at
retail
outside
of
new
mexico
don't
get
it
back?
justice
potter
stewart
or
from
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
far
as
new
mexico
goes,
the
net
effect
is
that
the
sellers
of
electricity,
the
wholesale
sellers
of
electricity
that
in
turn
is
sold
instate
are
not
taxed
and
those
who
sell
electricity
that
is
sold
at
retail
out
of
state
are
taxed,
isn't
that
correct
or
have
i
missed
something?
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
all
the
tax
payers
in
the
state.
the
total
tax
burden
on
a
single
tax
payer.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
by
a
tax
payer.
well,
maybe
five
different
people
pay
taxes
with
respect
to
the
commodity
of
electricity,
but
you
have
to
measure
it
by
its
affect
on
a
tax
payer,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
add
by
two
different
tax
payers.
justice
potter
stewart
the
generator
pays
a
2%
generation
tax
that
he
gets
back
if
the
electricity
is
ultimately
sold
inside
the
state,
isn't
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
the
generator
for
sale
in
wholesale
is
subject
to
gross
receipt
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct
as
a
matter
of
arizona
law
or
i
misunderstood
that
too?
justice
potter
stewart
that
a
sale
by
the
generator
at
wholesale
is
not
subject
to
the
gross
receipts
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
he
doesn't
pay
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
higher
tax
is
imposed
on
the
ultimate
consumer.
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
retail
seller?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
there
for
on
the
wholesaler
or
on
the
generator?
justice
potter
stewart
on
page
35
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
argument
this
statute
is
meaningless
and
unnecessary
is
that
correct
or
if
it
doesn't
add
or
subtract
anything
from
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico,
this
number
is
77-1810.
the
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
new
mexico
tax
imposed
upon
the
privilege
of
generating
electricity.
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
upheld
the
validity
of
this
energy
tax
against
federal
statutory
and
constitutional
attacks
and
the
issues
have
been
brought
to
this
court
by
way
of
a
direct
appeal
under
section
1257(2)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
the
appellants
contend
that
the
new
mexico
tax
is
invalid
under
a
specific
federal
statute
as
well
as
under
the
commerce,
due
process,
and
import-export
clauses
of
the
constitution.
for
the
reason
set
out
in
the
court's
written
opinion,
we
conclude
that
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
tax
is
invalid
by
reason
of
the
federal
statute,
and
accordingly,
we
reversed
the
judgment
without
reaching
the
substantive
constitutional
issues.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
he
has
been
joined
by
mr.
justice
white.
