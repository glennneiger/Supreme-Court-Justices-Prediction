chief
justice

e.

we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
78-432,
united
steelworkers
against
brian
weber
and
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
powers,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
employers
and
union
could
do
it,
if
congress
would
let
them
do
it,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
for
example
congress
had
a
statute
which
i,
i
will
try
to
draft
the
statute
here
but
something
to
this
effect
that
provided
however,
applying
to
all
existing
statutes
that
nothing
in
this
statutes
would
prohibit
an
employer,
unilaterally
or
by
contract
with
the
union
from
agreeing
to
carry
out
a
program
of
the
kind
we
have
here,
the
preferential
treatment
to
minorities
who'd
been
denied
equal
opportunities
in
the
past
in
order
to
remedy
that.
now,
there
wouldn't
be
any
state
action
in
that,
would
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
next,
do
you
think
that
would
run
foul
any
constitutional
prohibition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
assuming
from
statutory
recitals
of
past
discrimination
and
exclusion
including
the
longstanding
union
activities
that
prohibited
minorities
particularly
negroes
from
getting
into
apprentice
programs
or
even
membership
in
the
union.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
powers.
mr.
gottesman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
history
mr.
gottesman
of
this
union
having
done
as
so
many
unions
did
the
building
trades
unions
for
example
excluding
negroes
particularly
from
membership
in
the
union?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
doubt
is
there
that
quite
a
number
of
unions
have
had
a
systematic
exclusion
for
past
years
in
this
respect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
have
they
not
trained
them
or
have
excluded
them
from
membership
which
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
would
agree
with
your
colleague
who
just
said
that
congress
could
easily
clarify
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
present
statute,
could
an
employer
lawfully
announce
and
execute
a
program
saying
that
he
would
hire
approximately
50%
people
who
had
been
convicted
of
criminal
acts
and
were
released
either
on
preliminary
parole
or
permanently
released.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
within
that
range
of
50%
you
would
get
a
wide
range
of
racial
groups,
no
doubt
wouldn't
you
and
ethnic
groups?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said,
with
no
prohibition
an
employer
could
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
must
--
i
was
hypothesizing
an
employer
who
consciously
and
deliberately
wanted
to
try
to
help
rehabilitate
people
who
had
been
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
other
statute
that
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
is
that,
under
your
theory
you
can
discriminate
for
good
motives
that
count
for
bad
motives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
it
have
been
quite
easy
for
congress
to
express
these
concepts
in
the
terms
that
i
outlined
in
very
rough
suggestion
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
griggs,
mr.
wallace,
did
it
not
the
court
note
that
there
was
no
question
about
any
bad
faith
or
bad
motivation
of
the
employer?
and
then
on
the
contrary
the
employer
had
been
conducting
educational
programs
to
bring
its
minority
employees
up
to
high
school
equivalence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
turned
on
the
impact
not
on
the
intention.
was
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
covered
all
that
in
your
brief
now,
i
believe.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
--
oh!
we're
not
ready
for
you
yet
mr.
powers.
mr.
fontham.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
understand
that
there
is
any
challenge
to
the
idea
that
this
is
quota
program.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
have
misread
some
of
the
briefs
here.
perhaps
i'm
confusing
the
union's
brief
here,
with
some
of
the
unions'
amicus
brief
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fontham,
you
perhaps,
do
you
have
in
mind
the
hypothetical
amendment
to
title
vii
that
i
outlined
to
your
friends
in
their
oral
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
that
if
congress
passed
such
an
amendment
or
such
a
statute
that
an
employer
could
proceed
to
try
to
achieve
racial
balance
by
programs
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
(voice
overlap)
just
passing
statutes,
state
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we're
not
worried
about
that
in
this
case,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
projecting
into
the
future.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
powers,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
was
not
my
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
