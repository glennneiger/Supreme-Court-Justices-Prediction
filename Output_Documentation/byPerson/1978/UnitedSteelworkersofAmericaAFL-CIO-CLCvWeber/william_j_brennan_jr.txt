and
really
the
very
narrow
question,
you
could
have
done
this
as
my
brother
stewart
said
before
1964.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
only
narrow
and
very
narrow
question
is
whether
1964
act
forbids
you
from
doing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
that
there
is
to
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
all
there
is
to
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
you
opened
by
saying
that
you
did
not
think
the
issue
is
the
one
that
phrase
at
the
outset
of
this
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
you
do
agree,
don't
you,
that
the
only
question
here
is
whether
this
program
is
prohibited
by
title
vii?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
question
here?
