justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
bakke
case
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
one.
the
bakke
case
was
decided
by
majority
of
the
court
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
wholly
inapplicable
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
as
lawyers
and
judges,
it's
quite
different
isn't
it?
it
doesn't
involve
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
it
involved
the
1964
act
of
congress?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
pretty
clear
that
--
it's
entirely
clear
i
suppose
saying
the
one
side
the
post-civil
war
legislation
that
until
1964
your
client
could
have
had
a
training
program
for
all
white
people,
all
women,
all
negroes,
or
all
anything
else
and
it's
only
because
of
this
active
congress
that
this
lawsuit
arises,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitution
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
isn't
it?
isn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
only
your
position,
that's
the
fact
of
the
matter,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gottesman,
i
know
that
your
ultimate
position
is
that
this
simply
is
not
a
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
1964
act
but
isn't
it
despite
what
you
just
told
us,
isn't
it
on
its
face
--
prima
facie
a
violation.
it's
an
evident
discrimination
against
white
people,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
training?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
you
said,
i
assume
in
a
lawsuit
would
be
defensive,
wouldn't
it?
and
the
plaintiff
could
certainly,
be
it
mr.
weber
or
any
other
life's
similarly
situated
could
bring
a
lawsuit.
this
is
a
prima
facie
colorable
violation
and
then
what
you
said
would
be
a
complete
defense,
if
you're
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
whatever
it
may
be
or
may
not
be
discrimination
but
it's
not
a
violation
of
title
vii.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wallace,
if
we
accept
mr.
gottesman's
position
on
behalf
of
his
client,
we
don't
need
to
decide
whether
you're
right
or
wrong
as
to
the
extent
of
this
court's
remedial
power,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be,
perhaps
it
will
be
proper
for
the
court
to
reach
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
precisely
what
mr.
gottesman
does
not
do.
he
has
choose
all
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he's
correct
then
the
court
need
not
and
probably
should
not
reach
the
question
of
what
a
district
court
could
do
by
way
of
a
remedial
order
and
need
not
and
probably
should
not
reach
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
executive
order.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
basic
position,
does
it?
am
i
or
do
i
wholly
misapprehend
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
this.
i
think
mr.
gottesman
accepted
that
this
on
its
face
is
a
gross
violation
of
title
vii.
his
claim
simply
is
that
he
has
a
complete
defense
that
on
inspection,
it
turns
out
not
to
be
a
violation
of
title
vii.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
on
the
(voice
overlap)
obviously
are
under
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
if
you
will.
this
is
on
its
face
a
gross
violation
of
title
vii.
but
his
position
is
that
in
this
particular
context,
it
turns
out
not
to
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
if
he's
correct
then
what
possible
business
is
it
of
the
court's
in
this
case
to
reach
the
question
of
what
with
appropriate
remedy
be
in
the
event
of
a
violation
of
title
vii.
and
certainly,
what
business
is
of
the
court
in
this
case
to
reach
the
validity
of
the
executive
order.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
violation
was
found?
justice
potter
stewart
and
after
a
violation
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fontham
there
is
a
--
these
briefs
both
of
the
parties
and
amici
are
sprinkled
with
euphemisms
but
we
can't
decide
this
case
on
what
something
is
called
rather
than
on
what
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
equating
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
as
any
real
question
or
controversy
here
as
to
what
this
program
is
and
what
it
provides.
justice
potter
stewart
discriminate
against
some
white
people.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
don't
think
there's
any
service
of
opinion
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
there
in
any
event
mr.
fontham
that
even
if
mr.
weber
had
not
been
accepted
in
this
program
because
he
might
have,
there
might
have
been
white
people
of
more
seniority
than
people
of
more
seniority.
the
fact
is
that
some
people
were
excluded
from
acceptance
because
they
were
white
and
i
think
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there
is
no
controversy
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that's
not
the
union's
position
but
i
think
the
union's
position
would
be
that
if
there
is
a
conspicuous
disparity
in
the
workforce
and
then
that
90%
or
95%
or
98%
of
the
craft
employees
were
negro
and
only
2%
white,
i
think
as
i
understand
the
union's
position,
it
would
be
that
the
employer
and
the
union
could
cooperatively
and
voluntarily
agree
to
put
in
this
kind
of
a
program
until
a
more
representative
workforce
were
in
placed.
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
understand
it
the
same
way?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
way
i
understood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
the
difference
is
between
the
union's
position
and
the
employer's
position
and
the
government's
position.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
very
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
more
than
i
do,
if
you
will.
justice
potter
stewart
oh
that
would
depend,
the
validity
of
that
would
depend
upon
the
meaning
of
subsection
(j),
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
wouldn't
it
--
wouldn't
that
question
whether
the
validity
of
that
would
depend
would
it
not
upon
what
is
prohibited
by
subsection
(j)?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
yes
but
that
would
be
the
question,
wouldn't
it?
what
does
subsection
(j)
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
have
the
meaning
of
that
prohibition
here
because
government
has
not
justice
potter
stewart
--
sought
to
impose
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
conceded
that
this
was
a
voluntary
action
between
the
lawyer
and
the
union?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
there's
been
no
directive
or
prohibition
or
requirement
by
any
agency
of
government
in
this
case,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
subsection
(j)
only
has
to
do
with
what
may
not
be
required
by
government,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
case
doesn't
stem
from
anything
that
was
required
by
government,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
voluntary.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
your
honor?
