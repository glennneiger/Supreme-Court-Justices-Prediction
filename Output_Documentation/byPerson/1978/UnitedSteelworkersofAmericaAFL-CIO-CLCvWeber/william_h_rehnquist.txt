justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
powers,
supposing
that
the
quest
--
the
answers
you've
given
to
my
brother
white's
and
blackmun's
questions
previously
were
different,
that
there
wasn't
even
any
arguable
showing
that
your
company
had
discriminated
in
the
past.
do
you
think
that
the
program
you
instituted
1974
would
be
permissible
under
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
title
vii
isn't
the
executive
order,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
said
that
even
though
there
--
nobody
could
have
made
out
even
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
against
your
company
in
court,
nonetheless
this
agreement
was
permissible
under
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
--
can
you
answer
the
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
to
the
extent
that
creates
discriminate
situations
or
discrimination.
what's
your
position
as
to
whether
it
does
or
does
not
create
that
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
true
of
your
union,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
union
shop
type
of
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
is
left
of
mcdonald
then
if
your
view
would
prevail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
dealt
with
testing,
isn't
griggs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
the
case
involving
a
voluntary
agreement
between
management
and
labor,
we
should
go
ahead
and
decide
what
courts
could
if
the
matter
were
litigated
in
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
violation
was
found.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace
supposing
that
the
respondent,
the
plaintiff
here
had
come
in
the
court
alleging
the
same
facts
as
he
did
in
this
case.
i
take
it
under
your
view,
the
company
--
neither
the
company
nor
the
union
would
be
entitled
to
summary
judgment
or
motion
to
dismiss.
they
would
have
to
come
up
with
some
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
--
give
me
an
example
of
what
sort
of
evidence,
what
tangible
types
of
evidence
they
could
come
up
with
that
would
meet
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
--
the
complaint
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
you
produce
--
do
such
an
evidence
in
court?
i
mean
you
are
the
lawyer
for
the
union
or
the
lawyer
for
the
company.
how
do
you
show
in
court
in
response
to
a
point
is
that
you're
“vulnerable”
to
a
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fontham,
let
me
interrupt
you
just
a
minute.
as
my
brother
stewart
has
said
the
case
and
the
briefs
in
the
arguments
are
sprinkled
with
euphemism
you
have
used
the
term
remedy
once
and
your
brothers
and
sisters
have
used
it
and
you
now
used
the
term
goal.
what
do
you
mean
by
remedy
and
what
do
you
mean
by
goal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
use
the
word
remedy,
do
you
mean
you
suddenly
claim
that
a
particular
individual
had
against
you
for
damage
that
you
had
done
to
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fontham,
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
answer
to
the
union's
argument
that
703
(j)
when
it
says
that
nothing
contained
in
this
subchapter
shall
be
interpreted
to
require
any
employer.
attaches
special
significance
to
where
it
require
and
by
implication
permits
if
although
it
does
not
require
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
in
effect
that
the
explicit
language
of
(a)
and
(d)
prohibits
the
drawing
of
the
implication
that
the
union
draws
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
if
there
was
an
arguable
case,
the
entering
into
this
program
would
not
have
prevented
any
of
the
plaintiffs
in
that
arguable
case
from
suing
kaiser
or
the
union.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
that
sense,
neither
kaiser
nor
the
union
by
entering
into
this
agreement
immunize
themselves
from
suits
for
actual
discrimination.
