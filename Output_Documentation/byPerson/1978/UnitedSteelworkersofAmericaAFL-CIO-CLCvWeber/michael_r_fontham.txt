mr.
michael
r.
fontham
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
michael
fontham
and
i
represent
the
respondents
in
this
case,
brian
weber
and
the
class
of
the
non-minority
employees
at
the
kaiser
plant
in
gramercy,
louisiana
who
were
eligible
to
bid
for
on-the-job
training
programs.
the
issue
present
in
this
case
is
not
the
issue
stated
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
but
instead
as
whether
a
company
in
the
labor
union
may
institute
a
50%
racial
quota
for
entry
into
craft
training
program
that
discriminates
against
non-minority
employees
and
prefers
minority
employees
solely
to
achieve
a
certain
statistical
ratio
and
in
the
absence
of
any
past
discrimination
by
the
company
or
the
union,
against
the
preferred
individuals,
and
in
fact
in
the
absence
of
any
past
discrimination
at
the
plant
in
question.
in
the
course
of
argument,
i
would
like
to
first
of
all
address
three
factual
areas
which
i
think
are
of
concern
and
have
not
adequately
been
covered
discussed
the
law
if
i
have
an
opportunity
to
do
so
and
some
of
the
arguments
raised
by
my
opponents.
first
of
all
with
respect
to
the
facts,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
what
the
operation
of
the
quota
was
in
this
case
because
kaiser
and
the
union
have
instituted
training
programs
in
the
past
and
the
basis
for
entry
into
those
training
programs
in
additional
to
the
skills
required
or
the
absence
of
physical
handicaps
was
seniority.
and
that
seniority
criterion
was
a
plant-wide
seniority
criterion
at
this
plant
available
to
all
individuals
whether
they
were
white
or
black
or
other
minority
whether
they
were
male
or
female.
every
person
who
was
hired
at
the
gate
at
the
kaiser
plant
of
obtained
his
or
seniority
status
and
was
treated
equally
with
respect
to
that
seniority
system.
but
with
respect
to
the
craft
training
programs
and
i
might
add,
that
the
union
had
been
negotiating
for
its
members
to
have
this
training
opportunities.
the
members
of
the
union
were
unskilled
laborers
at
the
plant
and
the
opportunities
presented
by
the
training
programs
were
considered
very
important
by
these
persons.
an
opportunity
to
advance,
to
learn
a
skill,
which
skill
can
be
obtained
only
after
years
of
training
and
schooling.
and
so
it
was
very
important
to
this
people
who
thought
that
they
could
obtain
higher
wages,
better
working
conditions
and
even
more
importantly
more
security.
but
in
addition
to
this
seniority
criterion
for
entering
into
the
training
programs,
kaiser
and
union
imposed
a
50-50
racial
quota
which
said
that
for
every
non-minority
individual
who
entered
a
training
program,
they
must
take
a
minority
individual
so
that
if
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
it
certainly
is
a
quota
program.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
only
difference
is
that
some
of
the
parties
choose
to
call
the
quota
a
race-conscious
program.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
means
of
applying
the
race
consciousness
is
a
50-50
numerical
ratio
which
has
the
effect
of
actually
segregating
the
seniority
lines.
making
an
all
white
seniority
line
and
all
men
are
the
seniority
line
and
for
entry
into
the
training
programs
choosing
the
top
person
from
each
seniority
line.
but
which
also
has
the
concomitant
effect
of
advancing
members
of
minority
groups
over
whites
in
the
seniority
line
because
they
were
more
seniority
whites
in
the
seniority
line.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
absolutely
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
your
honor
is
that
the
effect
of
the
application
of
the
numerical
ratio
was
to
take
away
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
take
away
not
only
to
discriminate,
your
honor
but
in
addition
to
take
away
and
devalue
accrued
seniority
rights.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
they
had
been
built
up
over
years
of
service
to
kaiser
by
these
employees.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor?
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
mr.
weber
personally
had
been
employed
at
the
plant
i
believe
since
1968
or
1969.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor
but
the
seniority
system
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
they
are
plaintiffs.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
that's
correct.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
address
the
question
of
the
supposed
or
alleged
prima
facie
case
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
absolutely,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor,
i
was
simply
saying
that
i
didn't
--
i
would
phrase
it
differently
than
the
way
kaiser's
attorney
phrased
it.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
alleged
or
assumed
or
i
believe
the
word
that
is
used
in
this
case
is
arguable
past
discrimination
because
the
important,
i
think
the
important
fact
with
respect
to
the
record
is
that
two
courts
have
already
held
that
there
was
no
past
discrimination
in
kaiser.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
the
union
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
the
union
attempted
to
prove.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
the
black
in
place
at
the
plant,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
there
--
there
were
no
interveners
if
that's
the
question.
also
this
your
honor,
that
every
pleading
in
this
case
was
sent
to
the
national
office
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
based
on
testimony.
it
was
based
on
an
analysis
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
testimony
of
the
kaiser
officials.
statistics
with
respect
to
what
the
work
laws
were
comprise
of.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
expect
them
to
say
that.
but
i
do
know
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
the
union
tried
to
say
that
the
district
court,
your
honor.
the
union
filed
two
briefs
on
the
issue
and
filed
another
brief
on
the
issue
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
it's
the
same
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
it's
the
same
argument
that
the
government
raises
in
this
case
the
asserted
statistical
disparity
which
i
would
like
to
address.
what
i
do
think,
your
honor
that
the
fact,
the
question
of
kaiser's
past
employment
practices
was
covered
at
the
trial.
the
evidence
established
that
kaiser
would
have
a
plant-wide
seniority
system
and
that
the
seniority
system
granted
seniority
rights
to
minority
group.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no,
your
honor
to
all
employees.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no,
your
honor
just
simply
in
the
crafts.
in
the
crafts
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
sir.
well,
your
honor,
no
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
2%
of
the
skill
craftsmen
at
the
plant
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor
the
seniority
system
was
applicable
with
respect
to
the
unskilled
laborers
at
the
plant.
i
--
the
craft
positions
of
the
plant
are
in
a
separate
category
and
2%
of
the
persons
in
the
craft
positions
were
members
of
minority
groups
but
the
record
establishes
that
kaiser
attempted
a
number
of
affirmative
action
measures
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
racial
ratio
to
try
to
obtain
more
minority
craftsmen.
kaiser
had
a
separate
craft
application
filed
that
was
blacks
only
and
went
to
that
craft
application
file
first
whenever
an
open
occurred
in
the
craft
petitions.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
kaiser
advertised
in
minority
--
predominantly
minority
newspapers
in
the
area.
kaiser
attempted
the
establishment
of
goals
of
timetables
in
conjunction
with
the
requirements
of
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
and
the
fact
was
in
the
evidence
in
this
case
establishes
that
persons
who
were
treating
craftsmen
with
the
requisite
skills
were
not
available
in
the
area
and
that
in
fact
the
statistical
utilization
if
i
can
use
that
term.
a
minority
craftsman
in
the
kaiser
plant
was
no
smaller
than
the
availability
of
craftsmen
in
the
workforce
at
large.
the
simple
fact
is
that
for
reasons
of
--
whatever
reasons
exist,
societal
discrimination
or
whatever
either
reasons
but
minority
craftsmen
with
the
requisite
skills
were
not
available
and
kaiser
was
not
able
to
get
them.
and
as
a
result
of
that
fact,
even
though
kaiser
---
i
believe
judge
wisdom's
opinion
said
that
kaiser
had
made
good
faith
efforts,
a
laudable
efforts
to
try
to
seek
and
find
minority
craftsmen.
but
here
they're
not
able
to
do
so.
so
the
record
reflects
that
there
was
not
past
discrimination.
judge
wisdom
indicated,
although
he
would
draw
some
different
conclusions
about
possible
arguable
discrimination
based
on
pure
statistical
data
and
in
fact
comparison
not
of
persons
with
the
requisite
skills
but
a
different
comparison
that
he
conceded
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
would
not
be
overruled
under
the
applicable
standard
of
review
of
those
findings.
and
the
evidence
in
this
case,
your
honor,
we
did
go
into
the
evidence
about
whether
or
not
kaiser
discriminated
in
the
past.
i
think
if
you
heard
the
director
of
equal
employment
opportunity
affairs
with
kaiser
in
his
statements
on
the
question
of
race
relations,
in
united
states,
you
would
have
found
the
huge
and
very
sincere
and
forthright
and
honest
individual
and
spoke
very
convincingly.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no,
your
honor
i
don't
assume
that.
i
said
heard
it
and
i
think
that
that
does
make
a
difference
because
this
was
to
me
impressive.
but
i
think
that
the
important
thing
that
has
to
be
remembered
is
that
this
was
not
--
the
evidence
is
unambiguous
with
respect
to
why
this
was
done.
it
was
not
done
as
an
assertive
remedy.
this
was
done
because
kaiser
felt
the
need
under
ofcc
requirements
or
whatever
to
voluntarily
take
action
to
change
the
statistics.
the
fact
is
that
kaiser
knew
very
well
that
minority
craftsmen
were
unavailable
and
they
were
not
under
utilized
if
the
comparison
was
pertinence
with
the
skills.
but
kaiser
knew
that
the
government
might
say
that
you
have
to
compute
the
2%
to
the
overall
general
availability
of
minorities
which
were
39%.
so
kaiser
said
we've
got
to
change
the
ratio
and
what
they
did
was
they
imposed
this
50-50
ratio
for
selection
as
a
means
of
achieving
an
overall
39%
representation.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
it
would
not
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
i
want
to
make
a
point
as
strongly
as
i
can
that
we're
not
talking
about
even
that
situation,
that
the
fact
is
whether
it
would
make
a
difference
or
not
is
not
important
here
because
kaiser
never
undertook
an
analysis
at
the
gramercy
plant.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
we
found
that
there
was
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
that
with
respect
to
your
earlier
statement,
your
honor,
the
statement
made
by
my
opponent
is
rather
artfully
worded
and
it
says
that
kaiser
could
have
believed.
it
--
it
doesn't
say
that
kaiser
undertook
an
analysis
and
made
that
determination.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor
and
he
couldn't
have.
if
you
use
the
persons
with
a
requisite
skills
in
the
labor
force,
the
only
way
that
you
could
have
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
in
this
instance
would
have
been
to
compare
the
statistics
for
skilled
craftsmen
which
the
national
bureau
of
apprenticeship
says
can
take
up
the
five
years
of
training
in
and
schooling
and
which
kaiser
spent
$15-20,000.00
per
year
per
person
in
the
training
programs
including
on-the-job
training
and
significant
schooling.
if
you
took
that
statistics
the
2%
and
compared
that
to
everybody
in
the
labor
force
who
was
a
member
of
the
minority
group,
you
could
have
a
prima
facie
case
but
this
court
said
you're
not
suppose
to
that.
i
believe
it
said
that
and
instead
that
the
applicable
comparison
even
if
you're
trying
to
show
a
prima
facie
case
is
present
with
the
requisite
skills
so
you
would
compare
lawyers
in
the
law
firm
with
persons
who
have
a
law
degree
and
are
qualified
to
be
a
lawyer
or
doctors
in
a
medical
clinic
with
persons
who
are
qualified
to
practice
medicine
in
making
a
determination
of
whether
the
employer
had
discriminated.
but
in
this
case,
what
the
company
and
the
union
did
was
they
set
their
goal
which
is
what
they
call
it
as
the
ultimate
place
to
which
they
wanted
to
go.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
okay,
your
honor,
let
me
say,
hopefully
i
said
this
was
not
a
remedy.
i
did
use
the
term
remedy
and
when
i
say
remedy,
this
is
what
i
mean.
i
mean
that
you
have
an
individual
like
this
court
has
said
in
numerous
several
occasions
and
you
assertedly
or
allegedly
or
even
you
may
admit
that
you've
done
something
to
that
individual.
and
therefore,
you
remedy
that
by
returning
that
individual
to
where
he
would
be,
may
pay
him
some
money,
or
you
may
put
him
in
his
rightful
place
in
the
seniority
line
or
whatever.
i
think
that
it
is
incorrect
to
say
that
and
i
think
that
it's
very
unfortunate
that
the
argument
is
being
made
here
that
because
a
person
is
a
member
of
a
minority
group
that
someone
can
assert
or
allege
that
you
did
something
to
“x"
and
then
you
can
grant
a
preference
to
a
totally
different
individual
“y”
and
say
that
was
a
remedy.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
mean
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
the
legal
technical
sense
necessarily.
i
--
i
just
think
that
the
word
remedy
has
to
be
confined
in
the
individual
as
oppose
to
a
class.
it's
--
it's
not
remedial.
if
somebody
says
that
somebody
in
a
class
was
discriminated
against
and
we
pick
out
people
that
every
one
in
this
case
concedes
were
not
discriminated
against.
even
the
government
says,
they're
not
identified
victims
of
past
discrimination.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
by
kaiser,
yes,
your
honor
that's
true.
and
grant
them
preference.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
there's
no
doubt
and
i
fully
concede
that
societal
discrimination
has
occurred
with
respect
to
blacks
in
this
country
and
particularly
in
louisiana.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor,
i
think
but
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
we
have
in
this
case
what
is
happening
and
what
we
object
to
is
that
the
company
and
the
union
and
the
government
is
assumedly
have
decided
that
the
social
goal
which
i
think
is
a
lot
of
social
goal,
uplift
minority
groups
should
be
achieved.
but
what
they
decide
--
how
they
decided
to
do
it
is
to
have
the
unskilled
labor
force.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no,
your
honor.
in
my
opinion,
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor,
yes
they
did
in
the
sense
of
eliminating
barriers.
do
not
discriminate
in
the
future
is
what
congress
said
and
this
is
what
your
honor
said
in
mcdonald
that
no
discrimination
can
occur
against
any
individual
on
the
ground
of
race
and
i
think
your
honor
that
congress
has
said
that
affirmative
action
can
be
taken
to
break
down
barriers,
to
allow
everyone
an
equal
opportunity.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor?
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
i'm
very
sorry
to
hear
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
obvious
question
would
be
state
--
whether
there
were
federal
government
or
state
action
that
might
create
a
constitutional
problem
but
in
the
absence
of
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor,
the
question
is
would
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
be
enforcing
it
but
if
it's
not,
if
congress
wants
to
return
the
situation
to
pre-1964,
i
think
you're
absolutely
right.
they
could
do
that
and
employers
and
unions
could
try
to
achieve
social
goal
with
race
discrimination.
i
certainly
hope
that
congress
doesn't
decide
to
do
that
but
i
think
congress
is
definitely
as
of
now
decided
that
there
should
be
no
race
discrimination.
and
what
i
was
going
to
say
previously
is
that
what
kaiser
and
the
union
and
the
government
have
apparently
have
decided
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
achieve
the
social
goal
which
is
quite
laudable.
but
by
the
same
token,
kaiser
is
not
paying
the
cost
nor
is
the
union.
instead
the
entire
the
cost
of
this
program
is
placed
on
the
shoulders
of
the
non-minority
group
members
and
the
unskilled
labor
force
at
kaiser.
and
these
persons,
with
respect
to
these
persons,
i
don't
even
think
that
the
word
remedy
in
the
broadest
sense
could
be
applied
because
they
work
side
by
side
with
the
minority
group
members.
they
have
the
same
skills.
they
have
the
same
economic
standing.
they
have
the
same
seniority
rights.
they
have
the
same
opportunities
to
advance
within
the
plant
and
yet
the
non-minority
group
members
find
it
the
company
post
bids
with
one
of
the
bids
saying
that
for
this
opportunity
it
won't
be
seniority
but
it
would
instead
the
sole
criterion
will
be
that
only
a
member
of
the
minority
group
can
apply.
and
with
respect
to
other
bids,
that
it's
not
seniority
but
that
at
least
half
of
the
persons
that
we're
going
to
select
would
be
members
of
minority
groups
and
say
that
there
are
one
means
of
advancement
within
this
plan,
under
the
company
union
agreement,
seniority
is
accrued
after
years
of
service
to
the
employer
in
the
union
and
is
the
most
really,
i
think
even
this
court
has
said
the
most
fundamental
kind
of
important
right
for
a
person
who
works
in
the
labor
force
such
as
this
taken
away
that
the
accrued
rights
of
the
non-minority
employees
are
simply
taken
away
and
race
becomes
the
factor
for
determining
who
enters
into
the
training
programs
superimposed
upon
the
seniority
system.
and
it
is,
i
think
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
teamsters
case
where
even
in
the
case
of
the
–-
a
finding
of
past
discrimination
and
even
in
the
case
where
you're
talking
about
a
fair
degree
of
clarity
that
the
persons
being
preferred
had
been
discriminated
against
in
the
past.
the
court
is
saying,
only
with
respect
to
the
individuals
that
government
must
bear
its
burden
of
proving
that
the
individuals
here
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
but
that
the
individuals
had
been
discriminated
against
in
the
past.
in
--
in
this
case
we
have
a
pure
out
and
out
preference
being
granted
to
members
of
minority
groups.
we
feel
that
under
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
and
under
title
vii,
this
is
illegal.
title
vii
says
in
section
703
(a)
and
i
will
discuss
the
legislative
history,
in
fact
maybe
i
should
do
that
first,
i
think
that
the
inferences
drawn
by
the
union
in
this
case
are
very
difficult
to
adopt.
i
think
that
the
union's
brief
demonstrates
very,
very
substantially
that
there
was
nothing
sporadic
and
there
was
nothing
infrequent
about
the
statements
of
the
supporters
of
title
vii
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
quotas,
with
respect
to
the
issues
of
preferences
and
of
achieving
racial
balance.
the
fact
is
that
what
happened
when
title
vii
was
passed
was
that
the
opponents
got
up
and
they
began
making
claims
which
were
regarded
almost
as
outrageous
by
these
supporters
and
the
claims
were,
well,
this
would
permit
quotas
to
advance
minorities.
and
senator
humphrey
saying
a
quota
would
violate
title
vii
and
upon
the
same,
this
would
permit
attempting
to
achieve
a
racial
balance
and
senator
williams
and
senator
clark
and
senator
case,
the
persons
who
are
really
behind
say
no,
title
vii
says
no
discrimination
against
anyone
whether
he
be
a
member
of
a
minority
group
or
a
member
of
a
non-minority
group
and
just
as
we
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii,
i
think
that
this
is
the
thing
that
comes
through
the
most
fully.
in
fact,
the
union
was
able
to
find
90
pages
or
80-some
pages
of
legislative
history
all
in
the
same
subject
and
all
of
them
expressing
the
same
thing
the
opponent
is
saying
you
could
have
ratios.
the
supporters
saying
this
is
a
non-discrimination
statute
that
has
prospective
effect
that
will
allow
the
breaking
down
of
barriers.
and
then
if
you
would
say
section
703
(j)
says
you
can't
require
quotas,
they
will
put
that
in
there
because
the
opponents
were
saying
some
government
agency
is
going
to
require
quotas
which
that's
what
kaiser
and
the
union,
thought
the
government
was
doing
in
this
case,
and
the
supporters
saying
they
can't
do
that.
it
would
violate
title
vii.
and
in
--
so
what
does
the
statute
say
that's
applicable
to
this
case.
it
says
that
there
can
be
no
discrimination
against
any
individual
with
respect
to
their
employment
opportunities
on
the
ground
of
race,
color,
sex,
national
origin,
and
the
other
factors.
and
section
703
(d),
what
does
it
say?
because
it's
very
important
with
respect
to
this
argument,
this
is
a
new
program
and
it
gave
opportunities
to
everybody.
well,
the
fact
is
that
section
703
(d)
says
that
a
company
or
a
union
or
a
joint
labor
management
command
may
not
discriminate
against
any
individual
with
respect
to
entry
into
training
programs
or
with
respect
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
training
and
opportunities
provided
under
training.
and
i
think
from
my
own
standpoint
at
least,
the
court's
decision
in
mcdonald
answered
any
ambiguities
about
construction
of
title
vii.
mcdonald
came
out
of
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
had
dismissed
the
case
of
a
white
individual
who
allegedly
had
been
stealing
and
assertedly
some
minority
employees
were
not
dismissed
and
the
case
was
kind
of
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
fussy
manner
that
left
it
open
whether
the
white
individual
had
any
cause
of
action,
one.
and
number
two,
whether
the
same
standards
were
applicable
to
the
claim
of
the
white
individual
because
he
might
have
construed
the
fifth
circuit
as
having
said
that
well
there
is
a
cause
of
action
but
your
review
is
different
because
possibility
of
invidiousness
or
nastiness
of
the
discrimination.
so
the
case
was
brought
up
here
and
the
court
said
that
first
of
all
a
white
individual
does
have
a
cause
of
action
under
title
vii
and
secondly
and
most
importantly,
the
same
standards
are
applicable
as
if
that
white
individual
were
a
member
of
the
minority
group.
and
if
you
apply
the
same
standards
to
this
case,
what
if
kaiser
and
the
union
imposed
a
discriminatory
quota
against
members
of
minority
groups
to
achieve
what
they
thought
was
a
desirable
ratio
in
the
workforce.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor
but
i
think
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
to
me
there
were
differences
between
what
the
union
argued
in
oral
argument
and
in
the
brief
but
i
think
your
honor
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no
doubt,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
think,
however,
that
if
the
union
and
the
company
did
that,
there's
no
doubt
that
if
it
discriminated
against
negroes
or
other
members
of
minority
groups,
it
wouldn't
last
a
minute
in
this
court
or
any
other
court,
federal
court
virtually.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
the
first
place,
that's
solely
inference.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
say
it's
permitted
they
could.
in
the
second
place,
you
cannot
possibly
read
that
provision
in
conformity
with
section
703
(a)
and
section
703
(d).
the
requirements
saying
that
there
has
to
be
none
discrimination
against
anyone
because
if
as
long
as
the
attempt
to
achieve
the
racial
balance
discriminates
against
any
individual
then
it
would
be
wrong
under
title
vii.
i
think
also
that
the
union's
argument
really
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
supporters
of
title
vii
finally
said
if
the
opponents
are
going
to
say
this
and
say
this
and
say
this,
we'll
just
put
a
provision
in
the
statute
about
it.
and
if
you
read
the
newsletter
or
i
don't
know
exactly
the
term
that
you
use
but
when
mr.
--
senator
humphrey
explained
it
and
explained
what
senator
dirksen
wanted,
they
said
this
does
not
change
the
substance
of
the
statute.
what
we
are
doing
is
we
are
trying
to
simply
answer
the
contention
that
this
would
be
required
by
the
government
or
it
could
be
required
by
the
court.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
also
the
decisions
of
this
court
if
pretty
much
precluded
drawing
that
inference
because
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
you
cannot
discriminate
against
individuals.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
it
applies
i
know
to
state
and
local
governments
and
i'm
not
sure
about
the
extent
to
which
it
applies
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor,
because
this
court
had
said
so.
in
the
furnco
construction
corp.
against
waters
case,
it
is
clear
beyond
cavil
that
obligation
imposed
by
title
vii
to
provide
--
is
to
provide
an
equal
opportunity
for
each
applicant
regardless
of
race
without
regard
to
whether
members
of
the
applicants'
race
are
already
proportionately
represented
in
the
workforce.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
i
am
--
i
have
to
admit
that
i
did
not
read
all
the
legislative
history
of
title
iv.
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
they
were
passing
title
iv
at
the
same
time,
they
were
passing
title
vii,
however,
would
be
a
valid
ground
for
this
it
seems
to
me
extremely
tenuous
inference
drawing
from
language
that
on
it's
face,
actually
like
its
on
my
side
that
you
can't
require
racial
ratios
in
the
workforce
and
it
seems
to
me
as
well
to
say
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
think
so.
i
think
also
the
other
--
some
of
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
support
our
side
of
this
case.
the
decision
of
the
court
in
griggs
against
duke
water
indicates
specifically
stated
that
preferences
in
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
preference
that
discriminates
to
any
group
minority
or
majority
is
exactly
what
is
proscribed
by
title
vii.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
against
manhart,
i
think
is
very
important
because
in
that
case,
although
it
wasn't
a
race
discrimination
case,
the
court
stated
that
the
emphasis
in
title
vii
is
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
the
individual
and
that
it's
made
it
clear
that
these
rights
are
personal
rights.
and
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
this
asserted
justifications
being
brought
up
on
a
class
basis
in
which
the
minority
classes
are
amorphised
and
made
into
non-individuals.
in
the
sense
where
--
when
you
have
preferences
being
granted
to
individuals,
the
claim
is
made
that
these
are
remedies
because
they
are
members
of
the
class
and
yet
at
the
same
time
we
have
very
overt
discrimination
against
white
workers
that
has
the
same
kinds
of
economic
impact
or
frustration
or
raising
potential
loss
of
the
opportunity
to
advance
that
20,
30,
40
years
ago
was
the
rule
for
the
minority
group
members
in
this
country.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
decision
is
important,
very
important
to
this
case.
the
emphasis
should
be
on
the
individual.
in
the
teamsters
case,
this
court
made
it
very
clear
that
the
emphasis
is
on
the
individual
that
we
cannot
have
in
this
country
decisions
that
are
made
on
the
basis
of
race
or
class,
at
least
as
long
title
vii
is
operative
that
when
the
government
came
in,
in
teamsters
and
said,
well,
we
had
a
fair
degree
of
specificity
here,
why
don't
the
court
just
say
they're
all
members
of
the
class
and
its
okay
to
grant
them
a
remedy.
the
court
said,
prove
that
they
were
discriminated
against
in
the
past
on
an
individual
basis.
and
this
is,
one
thing
that
isn't
present
in
this
case
conceded
by
everyone,
none
of
these
persons
had
been
discriminated
against
in
the
past
by
kaiser.
instead
they
had
equal
rights
with
the
non-minority
members
of
the
unskilled
labor
force.
equal
rights
to
advance,
their
seniority
status
was
the
same
as
everyone
else's
except
in
some
cases
they
have
been
working
at
the
plant
for
less
time.
but
where
kaiser
and
the
union
did
was,
they
said
that
the
persons
who
had
been
working
at
the
plant
for
more
time
who
had
accrued
economic
expectations,
we
have
to
step
back
because
kaiser
understood
that
the
government
wanted
to
achieve
this
social
goal
and
kaiser
was
going
to
help
the
government
do
it
and
by
placing
all
the
cost
on
its
workers
rather
than
any
of
the
cost
on
itself
or
any
of
the
cost
on
the
union.
i
think
that
this
in
other
factor
that
is
very
important
that
should
be
answered,
these
pieces
of
voluntary
compliance.
the
one
thing
i
think
that
the
court
does
not
want
to
do
is
to
allow
employers
and
unions
be
the
arbiters
of
what
title
vii
means.
because
the
one
thing
you
can
expect
the
company
to
do
and
the
union
to
do,
just
naturally,
and
i'm
not
trying
to
say
that
this
is
done
in
wrong,
i
mean
with
the
wrong
intent
or
whatever
but
the
fact
is
that
if
they
can
put
the
cost
elsewhere,
they
will.
and
in
this
case,
that's
what
happened.
they
put
the
cost
elsewhere.
and
even
if
you
assume
that
there
was
an
arguable
case,
if
it
cost
on
the
unskilled
labor
force,
who
themselves
had
no
training
skills,
who
themselves
have
never
been
to
a
training
program,
who
themselves
have
never
been
to
a
training
program,
who
themselves
have
never
been
in
a
construction
union.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
think
that's
correct
too,
your
honor.
there
--
i
think
the
one
thing
that
the
courts
would
not
do
is
say
because
there
was
an
asserted
remedy
which
in
fact
was
a
preference
to
one
member
of
the
minority
group
that
another
individual
who
was
actually
discriminated
against
was
barred
from
suing.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
they
immunize
themselves
from
was
harassment
or
in
their
view,
harassment
by
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance.
in
other
words,
the
compliance
officers
under
the
federal
contract
program
require
this
utilization
analysis
which
focus
on
the
statistics
and
if
the
statistics
are
low,
then
the
possible
things
that
can
happen
are
the
lost
of
federal
contracts
and
reporting
you
to
the
justice
department
and
publication
of
the
company's
name
and
even
this
matter
which
all
the
company
lawyers
think
is
the
denial
of
due
process,
the
absence
of
the
hearing
on
the
debarment
from
future
contract
opportunities,
and
this
is
what
they
avoided.
it
really
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
litigation
at
gramercy.
there
may
have
been
some
litigation
at
some
other
plants
but
the
main
thing
that
they
were
trying
to
do
is
getting
compliance
with
the
ofcc.
now,
what
they
did
was
they
went
even
beyond
what
the
ofcc
has
ever
required
and
actually
instituted
a
quota
that
took
away
accrued
seniority
rights.
all
that
the
government
has
ever
said
that
it's
for
previous
to
today
is
these
goals
and
timetables
and
if
you
read
the
back
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
you'll
find
that
you
know
they
even
say
that
were
quotas
aren't
good.
and
if
you
read
what
the
eeoc
said
when
they
issued
their
guidelines
they
said,
“huh,
somebody
thought
that
when
you
said
numerical
ratios
in
our
preliminary
guidelines
that
we
meant
quotas
but
we
really
didn't”
so
they
deleted
it.
so
i
think
that
this
is
important
too
cause
everybody
says
to
me,
well
is
this
the
end
of
affirmative
action
if
whoever
wins
this
case.
and
the
fact
is
that
affirmative
action
has
never
gone
so
far
as
kaiser
and
the
union
wanted
to
go
in
this
case.
the
government
has
not
said
that
quotas
are
alright.
certainly,
nothing
ever
fixed
the
rigid
nature
and
in
enforcing
its
affirmative
action
programs
in
addition
to
that
the
taking
away
of
accrued
rights
has
been
stayed
away
from
by
the
courts.
even
when
you
have
these
instances
of
terrible
refusal
to
comply
with
the
requirements
to
breakdown
barriers
at
the
entry
level
sometimes,
the
lower
courts
has
said,
"well
if
the
state
police
just
won't
comply,
we'll
make
them
higher
a
certain
percentage
for
a
while
but
they
have
stayed
away
from
doing
that.
with
respect
to
accrued
rights
and
that's
what
in
the
case
where
there
is
a
violation
of
title
vii.
but
in
this
case,
they
go
beyond
any
type
of
an
affirmative
action
measured
that's
been
used
in
the
past
and
admitted
to
be
used,
a
quota
that
takes
away
accrued
seniority
rights
and
that
is
in
the
absence
of
any
past
discrimination
and
i
think
if
the
court
rules
in
favor
of
my
side
in
the
case,
it
doesn't
change
anything
in
terms
of
affirmative
action
actually
or
substantively.
on
the
other
hand
if
the
court
says
that
a
company
and
the
union
or
the
federal
government
can
require
quotas,
50-50
racial
quotas
and
as
in
this
case
that
quota
can
discriminate
against
whites
and
take
away
their
accrued
rights
and
the
sole
purpose
of
the
quota
is
to
achieve
the
statistical
parity
and
in
this
case,
if
your
honors
will
review
the
record
you
will
find
that
even
after
they
achieve
the
39%
representation
in
the
workforce,
that
they
will
then
use
the
quota
of
how
many
minority
group
members
are
in
the
workforce
at
large
indefinitely
in
order
to
keep
in
the
crafts
in
perpetuity
the
exact
statistical
percentage
of
the
minority
group
representation
in
the
population
at
large
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
we
do.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
i
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
projecting
in
the
future
but
i
think
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
if
the
court
were
to
say
that's
alright.
i
think
that
there
are
agencies
poised
to
enforce
that
decision
and
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
while
the
government
has
not
wanted
to
overtly
say
that
in
the
past
because
of
what
title
vii
says
that
it's
possible
and
very
likely
in
fact
and
specially
in
view
of
the
proposed
eeoc
guidelines
that
were
later
changed
that
the
government
would
require
every
contractor
in
the
nation
to
achieve
this
kind
of
statistical
parity
to
have
a
perfectly
proportionate
representation
in
the
workforce
at
large
on
a
basically
a
national
scale
which
–-
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
meaning
of
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
i
think
subsection
(j)
would
indicate
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
think
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
think
in
this
case
what
you
have
is
what
the
government
requires
is
the
employee
to
do
its
self-analysis.
so
the
government
doesn't
actually
say
that
the
company
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
absolutely.
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
what
i
thought.
i
do
think
though
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
the
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
it
was
a
voluntarily
inactive
program,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
recognize
that
that
statement
was
in
mcdonald.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
but
your
honor,
the
--
i
think
it's
a
--
what
the
court
also
said
was
that
title
vii
protects
all
individuals
whether
they
be
members
of
a
minority
group
or
not
members
of
a
minority
group,
and
that
those
persons
have
a
right
to
sue
and
to
have
a
relief
and
to
have
non-discrimination
on
an
individual
basis
under
title
vii.
and
even
if
an
affirmative
action
program
that
breaks
down
past
barriers
may
be
alright,
the
point
of
the
court's
decision
was
that
you
cannot
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
i
think
that
certainly
i
draw
from
that
decision
that
rights
cannot
be
discriminated
against.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor?
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
think
that
the
court
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
in
closing,
i
think
the
main
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
individuals
have
been
discriminated
against
in
this
case.
they've
lost
their
employment
status.
they've
lost
their
seniority
rights.
the
goals
or
desires
of
the
government
or
the
union
or
the
company
may
have
been
laudable
or
objectives
that
may
reach
some
social
desirable
point
but
the
fact
is
that
they
can't
try
to
accomplish
that
by
discrimination
against
non-minority
employees.
the
statements
of
title
vii
which
prohibit
any
discrimination
against
individuals,
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii
where
the
statements
are
repeated
and
repeated
and
repeated
and
repeated
that
it
would
not
permit
preferences
that
discrimination
against
non-minority
group
members
is
prohibited.
it
indicate
and
decisions
of
this
court
saying
that
why
individual
cases
are
to
be
trying
into
the
same
standards
as
cases
brought
by
members
of
minority
groups
all
say
that
the
class
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
brian
weber
and
the
other
individuals
who
lost
their
seniority
status
who
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
enter
these
training
programs
have
been
subjected
to
a
violation
of
title
vii
and
there
was
no
past
discrimination
in
this
case
that
could
justify
that
in
any
way.
there
was
no
discrimination
against
the
individuals
who
are
being
preferred
and
in
fact
there
was
no
discrimination
at
the
plant
at
large.
seniority
rights
were
granted
on
a
plant-wide
basis
to
everyone
and
everyone
had
an
equal
opportunity
to
advance
and
minority
group
members
will
advance
to
that
seniority
system
and
some
day
minority
group
members
will
be
fully
represented
in
the
craft
positions
at
that
plant.
it
may
not
be
as
speedy
as
some
planners
would
desire
but
even
so
those
planners
cannot
reach
that
point
via
discrimination
against
non-minority
group
members.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
that
if
--
i
that
there's
a
good
chance
he
would
be
on
my
side.
i
can't
say
for
sure
though.
