justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
--
do
you
concede
that
the
figures
would
have
made
out
of
prima
facie
case
requiring
kaiser
to
come
forward
with
some
explanation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
i'm
asking
whether
ultimately
whether
you
concede
that
after
the
case,
that
you
could
not
make
out
any
defense
but
do
you
concede
that
the
figures
would
make
a
prima
facie
case
that
would
require
you
to
come
forward?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this.suppose
when
title
vii
was
adopted,
there
was
an
employer
who
had
said
to
himself,
i
think
just
to
be
fair
i'm
going
to
have
my
workforce
mirror
the
racial
composition
of
the
community
in
so
far
as
blacks
and
whites
are
concerned.
suppose
it
was
70-30
and
he
hired
on
that
basis
all
the
time
and
he
maintained
as
near
as
he
could
70-30.
then
title
vii
occurred,
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
that
that
would
not
be
invalid
under
title
vii.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
still
approaching
it
then
as
a
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
did
you
answer
me
awhile
ago
the
way
you
did
that
an
employer
with
a
racially
balance
workforce
would
be
violating
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
said
he
was,
i
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
but
the
reason
the
words
you're
reading
there
read
on
my
example
too,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
arguing
that
this
collective
bargaining
contract
violates
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
how
long
your
submission
--
for
how
long
may
the
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
view
then,
mr.
wallace
that
when
it
reaches
that
--
when
it
finally
does
reflect
the
community
or
the
composition
of
the
workforce,
may
the
company
and
the
union
then
agree
to
maintain
that
balance,
consistent
with
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
care
to
say
yes
or
no,
it
would
or
wouldn't
violate
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
answer
is
that
in
your
present
submission
is
that
that
would
violate
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
fontham.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
suppose
that
just
on
the
figures
or
on
the
statistics
a
plaintiff
--
a
black
plaintiff
could
have
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
that
would
have
required
kaiser
to
put
on
some
evidence.
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
promised
to
agree
with
you
on
that
but
as
i
understand
your
position,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
in
this
program
and
if
kaiser
sat
down
with
his
lawyers
and
they
look
over
the
situation
and
in
their
opinion
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
could
be
made
out.
you
would
still
say
that
this
response
would
be
illegal
under
title
vii.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
they
freely
denied
that
--
freely
they
refused
to
admit
that
a
prima
facie
case
could
have
been
laid
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
kaiser?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
fontham,
i
take
it,
title
vii
now
applies
to
local
governments,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
to
state
and
local
government
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
does.
would
it
--
suppose
a
school
district
or
had
decided
to
integrate
its
faculty
or
to
have
racial
balance
in
its
faculty.
they
were
going
to
just
voluntarily
decided
to
have
racial
balance
in
their
schools
and
voluntary,
have
racial
balance
in
the
--
among
the
faculty?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
that
that
would
violate
title
vii
in
so
far
as
the
faculty
was
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
the
union
argues
that
there's
a
tie
between
title
iv
and
title
vii,
and
that
in
the
title
iv
discussion
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
congress
wasn't
objecting
to
voluntary
decisions
of
school
boards
to
integrate
their
faculty
this
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
avoid
--
you
can't
avoid
discrimination
by
discriminating.
that's
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
thanks
very
much.
