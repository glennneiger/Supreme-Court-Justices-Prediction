mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
at
issue
is
whether
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
permits
an
employer
and
a
union
to
remedy
the
past
exclusion
of
minorities
and
women
from
craft
employment
by
establishing
a
new
craft
training
program
which
takes
account
of
race
and
sex
in
selecting
those
to
be
trained.
let
me
begin
by
stating
one
central
fact,
the
provisions
of
the
1974
kaiser
steelworker
labor
agreement
which
are
being
challenged
in
this
case
where
a
remedial
measure
adopted
in
response
to
employment
discrimination
litigation
concerning
a
lack
of
minorities
and
women
in
craft
employment.
those
are
not
simply
my
words.
they
are
contained
in
the
provisions
of
the
labor
agreement
itself
and
they
appear
in
paragraph
5
of
plaintiff's
complaint
in
this
case
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
at
page
11
and
they
were
admitted
not
only
by
the
company
but
by
the
union
in
its
answer
to
the
complaint
which
appears
in
page
17
of
the
joint
appendix.
so
the
character
of
the
program
is
not
really
in
dispute.
it
was
remedial
and
it
sought
to
do
more
than
remedy
or
achieve
racial
balance
for
society
sake.
the
program
was
explicitly
focused
in
response
to
employment
discrimination
litigation
in
which
both
kaiser
and
the
steelworkers
were
then
engaged.
to
meet
the
situation,
the
kaiser
steelworker
agreement
established
a
new
program
at
15
company
plants
under
which
kaiser
employees
who
had
no
prior
craft
experience
could
achieve
training.
and,
as
was
being
done
in
the
steelworks
consent
decree
to
which
the
steelworkers
were
a
party,
the
agreement
provided
that
50%
of
the
training
opportunities
would
be
allotted
to
minorities
and
women.
one
of
those
15
clients
is
the
gramercy
louisiana
plant
which
is
engaged
--
which
is
the
site
of
this
litigation.
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
the
company's
desire
to
assure
compliance
with
its
title
vii
and
executive
order
obligations
were
not
simply
involved
in
the
establishment
of
the
1974
program,
they
were
the
reason
for
it.
if
the
company
had
been
able
to
recruit
what
it
regarded
as
adequate
numbers
of
minorities
and
women
who
were
already
fully
trained,
then
it
would
have
had
every
reason
to
continue
to
take
advantage
of
its
ability
to
recruit
fully
trained
craftsmen
and
save
the
substantial
cost
that
training
involved.
as
it's
clear
from
the
record,
at
the
gramercy
plant
alone,
by
agreeing
to
this
training
program,
the
company
undertook
an
obligation
that
could
be
expected
to
cost
it
$400.00
up
to
$400,000.00
a
year.
now,
this
training
program
provided
opportunities
not
only
for
blacks
and
women
but
for
white
males
who
had
no
prior
craft
experience.
the
respondent
brian
weber
was
one
of
those
employees
who
had
no
prior
craft
experience.
and
when
opportunities
came
to
bid
in
this
new
craft
training
program,
he
bid.
and
when
he
was
not
selected,
he
filed
a
charge
under
title
vii
alleging
that
he
would
have
been
discriminated
against
because
blacks
less
senior
than
he
had
been
selected.
the
lower
courts
--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
kaiser
does
not
admit
past
discrimination.
it
does
concede
that
both
the
substantially
low
employment
of
minorities
and
women
in
craft
jobs
at
the
time
and
the
fact
that
it
had
insisted
on
prior
experience
as
a
condition
not
only
for
employment
as
a
full
craftsman
but
also
for
entry
to
into
training
programs
where
factors
that
a
court
might
have
used
in
finding
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
kaiser
does
not
concede
discrimination
under
title
vii.
it
does
not
concede
that
the
executive
order
required
this
action.
it
recognize
--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
we
certainly
would
concede
that
it's
arguable
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
parson
against
kaiser
which
involves
a
neighboring
plant
of
kaiser
to
the
gramercy
plant
and
one
that
is
also
subject
to
this
1974
agreement
shows
that
courts
could
reach
that
conclusion.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
i
don't
concede.we
don't
concede
that
there
is
a
prima
facie
case.
we
do
recognize
that
there
are
the
elements
that
a
court
might
use
to
find
such
a
prima
facie
case.
the
two
points
that
we
want
to
stress
at
this
time
are
these,
in
our
judgment
the
standard
which
the
fifth
circuit
adopted
and
which
the
lower
court
and
which
the
respondents
argue
for
that
there
must
be
a
proof
of
prior
discrimination
and
an
identification
of
the
victims
of
that
discrimination.
well,
literary
in
affirmative
action,
if
that
is
the
price
that
employers
and
unions
must
pay,
in
order
to
try
to
remedy
the
exclusions
of
the
past,
it
is
in
our
judgment
prohibitive.
secondly,
we
consider
that
the
type
of
remedial
action
that
was
taken
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
the
standards
which
a
majority
of
this
court
approved
in
the
bakke
case
and
are
otherwise
reasonable.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
we
believe
your
honor
that,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
standard
is
no
stricter
for
approving
race
conscious
action
under
title
vii.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
it
does
not
involve
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
that
is
correct.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
that
is
correct.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
that
is
our
position
and
we
believe
that's
clear.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
excuse
me?
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
yes,
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
oh!
there's
no
question
--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
that
is
correct.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
and
in
our
judgment
--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
i
believe
it
is
all.
and
we
would
say
furthermore,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
we
believe
far
from
prohibiting
this
type
of
action,
we
believe
that
title
vii
encourages
it.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
we
believe
that
title
vii
may
require
employers
to
take
action
which
prevents
them
from
importing
into
their
own
workforce
discrimination
which
others
have
--
are
responsible
for.
we
believe
that
that
is
certainly
the
way
the
executive
order
seems
to
have
been
interpreted
and
upheld.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
it
is
not
but
it
is
our
understanding
that
the
two
are
to
be
construed
--
are
to
be
reconciled
and
as
we
read
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii,
the
64
legislative
history,
the
congress
was
aware
that
there
was
an
executive
order
and
it
sought
to
provide
that
that
programming
including
the
affirmative
action
elements
of
it,
would
be
allowed
to
continue.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
what
i'm
--
my
point
is
this
that
we
think
there
must
be
--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
yes,
sir.
my
difficulty
is
simply
in
responding
to
you
as
to
whether
or
not
an
employer
can
be
charged
with
discrimination
when
he
acts
in
such
a
way
that
brings
the
practices
of
others
into
his
own
workplace.
some
would
say
that
that
creates
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
on
the
part
of
that
employer.
it
isn't
what
the
employer
has
initiated
but
what
he
perpetuates
in
his
workplace
to
the
extent
that
that
creates
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
then
that
is
a
situation
comparable
to
the
one
in
which
kaiser
found
itself.
it
was
trying
to
utilize
experienced
craftsmen
trained
by
others
under
conditions
which
it
seems
to
me
were
clearly
recognized
as
being
discriminatory.
i
cited
some
--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
i
come
back
to
my
first
answer
to
mr.
justice
white.
we
denied
that
the
company
discriminated.
we
recognize
that
there
are
questions
as
to
whether
certain
conduct
may
be
regarded
as
creating
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
and
required
justification.
we
think
that
employers
and
unions
must
be
allowed
to
take
this
kind
of
remedial
action
recognizing
that
the
outcome
of
litigation
may
be
in
doubt.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
we
believe
that
congress
could
specifically
authorize
this
type
of
action.
it's
our
position
that
it
did
not
prohibit
it.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
well,
i
suppose
that
legislation
would
have
to
pass
the
equal
protection
standards.
we
believe
if
an
adequate
basis
was
laid
it
could
be
time
to
be
lawful.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
well,
i
mentioned
the
equal
protection
question.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
an
adequate
basis
in
a
finding
that
this
remedial
action
is
necessary
it
would
be
upheld.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
we
would
think
that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i'll
be
very
brief.
first,
let
me
say
that
this
is
not
an
unheard
or
form
of
an
affirmative
action.
in
the
two
largest
consent
decrees
which
have
been
entered
in
this
country,
the
at&t
consent
decree
and
the
steel
industry
consent
decree,
this
very
form
of
action
was
proposed,
was
adopted
by
the
lower
courts
that
affirmed
on
appeal.
secondly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
we
do
not
believe
that
a
congressional
amendment
is
required
to
approve
the
type
of
action
that
was
taken
here.
we
think
that
--
mr.
noyes
thompson
powers
we
think
that
nothing
could
be
clear
and
that
the
congress
intended
that
this
type
of
voluntary
action
be
taken
consistent
with
the
broad
remedial
purposes
of
the
statute.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
counsel
have
engaged
in
euphemisms.
let
me
stress
that
we're
not
suggesting
that
this
matter
should
be
solved
in
terms
of
a
label
that's
placed
on
it.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
action
that
the
company
and
the
union
have
taken
here
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
words
of
this
court
in
albemarle
paper
against
moody,
when
it
suggested
that
it
wanted
to
provide
the
spur
or
catalyst
that
causes
employers
and
unions
to
self-examine
and
to
self-evaluate
their
employment
practices
and
to
endeavor
to
eliminate
so
far
as
possible
the
last
vestige
of
an
unfortunate
and
ignominious
page
in
this
country's
history.
we
believe
that
what
the
company
and
the
union
have
done
in
this
case
meets
that
standard.
we
would
suggest
that
far
from
debasing
or
taking
away
from
brian
weber
and
other
white
employees
who
lack
craft
experience
at
the
gramercy
plant
and
at
other
kaiser
plants.
what
the
company
and
the
union
did
here
enhance
their
seniority.
it
gave
them
an
opportunity
along
with
black
employees
and
other
minority
employees
and
female
employees
to
become
craft
qualified.
it
set
up
that
program
in
the
best
way
that
the
company
and
the
union
could
find
to
both
respond
to
the
value
and
virtues
of
seniority.
and
yet
to
make
a
demonstration
that
the
old
barriers
for
minorities
and
women
had
ended
and
that
the
new
opportunities
promised
by
title
vii
were
in
fact
real.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
commendable
example
of
what
can
be
achieved
through
collective
bargaining.
but
we're
not
here
asking
for
commendation,
we
ask
only
that
our
right
to
continue
this
program
be
upheld.
thank
you.
