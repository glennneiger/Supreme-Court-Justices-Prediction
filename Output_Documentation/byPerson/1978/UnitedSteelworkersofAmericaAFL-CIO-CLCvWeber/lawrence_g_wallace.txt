mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
agrees
that
the
plan
at
issue
before
the
court
is
a
valid
plan
but
with
--
there
are
many
differences
between
our
position
and
that
of
the
union
we
just
spoke.
we
also
agree
that
that
the
issue
is
a
statutory
issue
of
reconciling
the
broadly
worded
prohibitions
of
title
vii
with
the
statutes
remedial
purposes
and
with
its
emphasis
on
voluntary
compliance.
however,
we
believe
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
read
the
language
of
title
vii
as
it
was
drafted
in
1964
and
snippets
of
the
many
thousand
of
pages
of
legislative
history
as
dealing
with
the
question
of
voluntary
programs
of
this
kind.
they
were
not
in
existence.
they
were
in
a
realistic
sense
to
fire
this
thing
from
the
mind
of
the
draftsmen
of
title
vii
at
that
time.
and
while
the
case
immediately
concerns
an
issue
of
voluntary
compliance
program,
the
contentions
that
have
been
made
before
this
court
cut
much
more
deeply
than
that
into
the
remedial
fabric
and
effect
of
enforcement
of
title
vii.
the
respondents
and
i
regret
to
say,
the
petitioner
union,
are
asking
the
court
in
this
case
to
repudiate
the
numerous
federal
court
decisions
over
the
years
that
have
upheld
the
propriety
of
the
ordering
or
numerical
race
conscious
relief
to
rectify
the
effects
of
an
employer's
proven
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
be
possible
for
the
court
not
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
of
the
parties
are
arguing
on
the
basis
of
premises
as
to
the
symmetry
or
lack
thereof
between
remedial
orders
litigated
decrees,
consent
decrees
and
voluntary
action
can
be
undertaken.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
his
brief
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
his
brief
he
asks
the
court
to
hold
that
the
line
of
cases
cited
in
footnote
14
of
our
brief
on
page
26
were
wrongly
decided.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
his
position
can
stand
without
it.
obviously,
the
result
can
stand
without
it
because
we
argue
for
the
same
result.
however,
the
premise
is
that
he
was
stating
orally
to
the
court
are
not
easy
to
reconcile
with
the
first
major
decision
of
this
court
under
title
vii,
griggs
against
duke
power
company
which
rejects
the
notion
that
invidiousness
evil
purpose
is
an
element
of
the
prohibitions.it
seems
to
me
a
revision
is
view
of
all
of
the
holdings
under
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
dealt
with
testing
but
it
said
that
even
unintentional
disparate
of
facts
on
racial
groups
can
be
a
violation
of
the
act
despite
complete
lack
of
evil
purpose,
invidiousness,
or
any
of
the
other
terms
that
were
just
submitted
to
this
court
as
properly
to
be
read
in
to
section
703
(a)
and
703
(d).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
agree
with
the
bottom
line.
yes,
we
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
difficult
to
decide
the
case
in
isolation
from
other
holdings
interpreting
title
vii
in
a
comprehensive
way,
i
think
it's
quite
true
that
narrowly
speaking,
the
court
could
avoid
the
question
whether
programs
of
this
type
could
be
approved
in
consent
decrees,
as
they
had
in
many
cases
or
whether
they
could
be
ordered
as
remedies
in
litigated
cases.
the
question
has
been
put
the
court
many
times
in
petitions
for
certiorari
arising
from
the
eighth
courts
of
appeals
that
if
it
proved
such
relief
and
the
court
has
always
declined
to
hear
the
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
nonetheless,
the
employers
have
been
found
to
violate
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
and
the
respondent
here
has
submitted
that
the
same
type
of
prima
facie
case
about
impact
on
him
through
the
use
of
a
racial
criterion
that
requires
a
response
and
that
has
been
in
our
view
rebutted
by
the
circumstances
in
which
this
program
arose.
and
the
reasons
for
which
the
program
was
adopted
but
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
reconcile
with
the
interpretation
of
title
vii
that
this
court
has
adopted
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
revisions
to
title
vii
and
the
consistent
views
of
the
agencies
that
administered
title
vii,
the
idea
that
this
is
not
a
prima
facie
showing
of
the
violation
of
title
vii
because
it
was
not
done
with
an
invidious
purpose.
and
that
the
broad
prohibitions
are
to
be
read
more
narrowly
and
that
somehow
by
negative
implication,
every
employer
is
left
free
which
is
the
reading
of
section
703
(j),
as
the
court
has
been
invited
to
make.
every
employer
is
left
free
to
achieve
balance
with
respect
to
every
element
of
his
workforce
by
race
or
by
sex.
and
so
that
anywhere
where
blacks
are
overrepresented
or
women
are
overrepresented
or
men
are
overrepresented.
he's
free
to
rectify
that
without
any
reasonable
basis
to
think
that
he
could
be
liable
to
an
action
under
title
vii
or
that
he
might
be
violating
the
executive
order
program.
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
the
court
is
being
invited
to
say
and
it
goes
far
to
it
undermining
both
the
subtle
interpretation
of
the
prohibitions
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
and
the
effectiveness
of
any
possible
enforcement.
it's
--
the
contention
is
that
what
the
court
referred
to
an
albemarle
paper
company
is
the
spur
or
catalyst
that
encourages
voluntary
compliance
is
to
be
removed
and
the
court
is
to
take
it
on
faith
that
employers
like
kaiser
will
continue
to
spend
hundreds
of
thousand
of
dollars
even
though
there's
no
possibility
that
a
court
could
order
them
to
adopt
a
similar
program
and
that
unions
will
continue
to
agree
to
such
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
--
the
contract
is
consistent
with
title
vii.
that
is
our
view.
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
the
interpretation
of
the
union
has
asked
this
court
to
make
of
title
vii
with
underlying
effective
enforcement
of
title
vii.
now,
it's
possible
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
for
the
court
not
to
reach
that
question.
but
nonetheless,
the
interpretation
that
was
just
stated
orally
is
one
that's
inconsistent
with
effective
enforcement
of
the
prohibitions
of
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
a
symmetry
between
of
the
relief
that
courts
can
order
and
of
the
voluntary
programs
that
can
be
entered
into.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
otherwise,
the
use
of
a
racial
criteria
and
presents
a
problem.
now,
i
--
the
tener
of
the
questioning
is
that
somehow
we
are
not
supporting
the
validity
of
the
program
but
are
submission
is
quite
to
the
contrary
that
the
way
in
which
we
are
supporting
the
validity
of
the
program
is
a
rational
that
will
make
it
possible
for
such
programs
to
continue
in
existence
and
to
be
expected
to
continue
in
existence.
otherwise,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
program
has
many
features
that
are
consistent
with
the
proper
remedial
approach
under
title
vii.
it's
a
program
that
is
finite
and
that
it
has
a
one
for
one
obligation
that
will
expire
when
the
local
workforce
ratio
is
reflected
in
the
plant.
in
this
case,
it's
39%.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
--
it
create
a
difficult
problem
under
title
vii
that
they
would
be
turning
away
people
from
employment
on
the
basis
of
their
race.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
hard
to
say
just
on
this
--
on
that
bare
hypothetical
but
i
will
say
that
if
a
person
black
or
white
is
turned
away
from
employment
on
the
basis
of
his
race
because
the
employer
wants
to
maintain
a
certain
balance.
there
has
to
be
more
of
a
justification
than
a
negative
implication
right
into
section
703
(j).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
the
face,
it's
a
prima
facie
violation
and
the
rest
it's
justified
there
is
a
violation
there.
now,
this
program
represents
what
to
us
is
an
example
of
the
way
title
vii
should
operate
in
a
litigated
decree
or
consent
decree
or
a
voluntary
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
whether
in
the
case
of
voluntary
program
it
is
a
reasonable
basis
to
think
that
a
violation
could
be
shown
unless
something
was
done
to
rectify
the
situation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
they
did.
they
agreed
on
this
program
and
it
was
a
reasonable
program
for
them
to
agree
on
in
the
circumstances
and
i
want
to
say
why
if
i
may.
we
had
here
a
situation
where
there
was
46%
local
population
--
46%
black
local
population,
a
local
labor
force
that
was
39%
black.
and
at
the
time
this
program
was
agreed
to
less
than
2%
of
the
skilled
craft
workers
in
this
plant
were
minority.
and
this
has
been
changed
in
the
statistics
set
forth
in
the
appendix
in
the
chart
on
page
167,
as
a
result
of
the
operation
of
the
program
this
has
been
increased
to
4.43%
in
a
situation
where
not
only
the
total
workforce
is
39%
black
but
the
figures
that
we
have
been
able
to
glean
from
the
census
data
show
that
even
among
skilled
craft
people
in
the
area,
you
would
expect
15
or
20%
minority.
and
a
similar
program
was
adopted
that
changed
the
representation
in
the
plant
as
a
whole
from
some
10%
minority
over
a
course
of
5
years
from
1969
to
1974
to
14.8%
minority.
the
program
was
one
that
was
adopted
in
an
atmosphere
where
the
employer
was
definitely
had
a
reasonable
basis
to
think
that
he
was
subject
to
the
making
of
a
prima
facie
case
that
he
was
guilty
of
employment
discrimination
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
parsons
case
brought
against
the
neighboring
plant
of
kaiser's
based
on
very
similar
statistics
said
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
a
prima
facie
case
had
been
shown.
the
actual
selection
of
people
under
the
program
while
it
was
50-50
for
the
training
program
at
the
same
time
skilled
craftsman
were
being
hired
outside
the
training
program,
22
were
hired
that
year.
journeymen
from
the
community
at
large
of
whom
only
one
was
black,
21
were
white,
seven
blacks
and
six
whites
were
taken
into
the
training
program
so
that
altogether
the
entry
into
craft
jobs
under
the
program
in
its
first
year
of
operation
was
in
the
sense
a
rather
modest.
it
was
about
23%
minority.
the
program
offered
new
opportunities
for
white
workers
to
enter
the
crafts.
it
did
not
in
anyway
abrogate
established
seniority
rights.
you
don't
have
the
problem
under
703
(h)
that
you
had
in
the
teamsters
case
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
and
we
believe
that
this
program
should
be
upheld
as
a
reasonable
response
to
the
situation
that
the
company
and
union
were
in.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
very
kind
of
evidence
that
i've
been
pointing
to
meets
the
respondent's
case
here.
and
was
your
question
related
to
a
complaint
by
a
minority
worker?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
complaint
in
this
case
is
the
very
evidence
that
i've
been
pointing
to
of
the
vulnerability
of
the
employer
to
a
suit.
now
we
don't
have
in
this
record
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
evidence
was
produced
here
mr.
justice.
witnesses
for
the
company
testified
that
they
were
concerned
about
compliance
with
the
executive
order
program
and
about
the
possibility
of
lawsuits
that
lawsuits
had
been
brought
elsewhere.
the
statistical
evidence
was
introduced
that
i
just
reviewed
that
showed
a
sufficient
disparity
to
itself
be
a
prima
facie
case
under
this
court's
holding
in
dothard
against
rawlinson,
so
that
the
evidence
was
actually
in
the
case.
this
is
an
example
of
how
the
evidence
can
be
shown
that
does
rebut
a
prima
facie
case
and
our
view
is
that
a
prima
facie
case
was
rebutted
on
this
record.
and
that
was
the
reason
why
the
program
should
be
upheld.
