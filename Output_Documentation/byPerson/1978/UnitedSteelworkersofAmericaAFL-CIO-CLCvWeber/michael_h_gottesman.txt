mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
that's
here
today
reflects
one
small
part
of
what
was
the
nationwide
program
undertaken
by
the
steelworkers
union
in
1974.
in
that
year,
it
negotiated
not
just
with
this
company,
and
not
just
with
this
industry
but
with
all
the
major
industries
whose
employees
it
represents
programs
similar
to
this
at
every
plant
providing
that
where
a
racial
imbalance
exists
as
between
the
production
jobs
and
the
craft
jobs.
a
quota
would
be
instituted
awarding
50%
of
those
jobs.
the
craft
jobs
and
craft
training
jobs
to
minorities
until
that
imbalance
had
been
eliminated.
the
union
has
since
reconfirmed
its
commitment
to
that
program
at
three
successive
conventions
despite
robust
debate
including
arguments
against
that
program
from
delegate
brian
weber
at
the
most
recent
convention
which
followed
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
and
the
union
is
most
anxious
to
sustain
as
lawful
its
right
to
negotiated
contracts
of
this
type.
now,
the
union's
view
as
to
what
title
vii
permits
is
somewhat
different
from
that
of
the
company
and
it's
broader.
in
our
view,
congress
in
prohibiting
discrimination
in
title
vii
did
not
intend
to
prohibit
any
form
of,
and
i
would
call
it
affirmative
action.
congress
did
not
intend
to
take
from
private
employers
and
unions
the
right
to
adopt
the
program
where
they
had
a
segregated
workforce
regardless
whether
that
segregation
was
their
own
fault,
was
the
fault
of
other
societal
factors
and
without
the
need
to
have
to
conduct
the
major
investigation
to
trace
just
what
the
cause
of
that
segregation
was.
that
the
mere
existence
of
that
segregation
was
an
undesirable
phenomenon
which
that
company
and
union
could
address
by
the
adoption
of
the
court.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
on
the
contrary,
we
think
that
would
be
the
zone
of
permissive
action
as
we
understand
it
is
not
that
an
employer
and
union
can
opt
as
a
permanent
matter
forever
to
hire
on
a
racial
basis.
it's
not
that
they
can
maintain
racial
balance
for
its
own
sake.
this
owner
permission
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it's
remedial
in
the
sense
that
if
a
segregated
workforce
is
a
bad
thing
to
have,
it's
something
you
ought
to
be
able
to
remedy
but
not
necessary
remedial
in
the
sense
of
we
committed
a
sin
therefore
we
have
to
correct
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
the
history
of
this
union
is
that
it
was
built
with
black
members
first.
and
that
in
the
1930s
and
40s
when
it
was
against
the
law
in
the
south
to
conduct
integrated
meetings,
the
leadership
of
this
union
was
dragged
off
to
jail
every
month
because
the
union
refused
to
hold
segregated
meetings
even
where
the
law
required
that
and
there's
no
history,
and
this
is
important,
to
our
problem
in
trying
to
uphold
this
agreement
(voice
overlap).
pardon
me?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
interracial.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
there's
no
question
about
that
from
historic
that
this
union
never
segregated
in
any
respect
whatever.
nor
is
there
any
question
that
this
union
had
no
responsibility
for
the
picture
of
white
exclusion
from
the
crafts.
unfortunately,
the
companies
would
not
give
the
union
a
voice
in
craft
selection
so
the
union
did
not
have
the
opportunity
even
if
that
had
been
its
vent
to
commit
discrimination.
the
union
had
been
fighting
for
years
as
this
record
shows
to
get
this
company
to
institute
training
program
so
that
the
whites
and
blacks
in
the
plant
would
be
able
to
qualify
for
this
craft
jobs.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think,
your
honor,
it
is
not
correct
of
industrial
unions
that
there
is
such
a
history.
there
are
findings
by
court
that
some
of
the
building
trades
unions
had
that.
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
that.
i
know
that
courts
have
so
found.
and
the
company
testified
below
the
trial
that
they
believe
the
reason
they
could
not
find
black
craftsman
when
they
went
out
to
hire
was
that
those
unions
which
provided
training
in
louisiana
prior
to
1974
had
not
trained
blacks.
so
they
pointed
to
this
element
of
societal
discrimination
as
the
source
of
the
different
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
what
they
testified
was
that
they
had
not
provided
them
training.
it
was
the
lack
of
training
which
disabled
kaiser
from
hiring
them
because
they
didn't
have
to
train
black
craftsman
in
the
community.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
our
union
takes
into
membership
who
the
company's
hire.
we
don't
train
people.
we
--
the
membership
of
industrial
unions
generally
and
of
the
steelworkers
in
particular
is
all
the
employees
employed
at
the
plants
that
the
union
represent.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
union
shop
or
where
it's
permissible
and
if
not
then
whatever
of
those
we
represent
them
all
and
whoever
chooses
to
join
in
most
happily
do
but
the
union's
membership
reflects
whoever
the
company
chooses
to
hire
and
the
union
doesn't
conduct
craft
training
programs.
the
union
negotiates
to
get
the
employer
to
adopt
craft
training
programs
as
one
of
the
benefits
that
it
provides
to
its
employees.
now,
if
i
may,
our
position
is
broader
in
terms
of
what
we
say
congress
left
to
private
parties.
our
position
is
wherever
you
have
a
segregation
in
your
workforce,
you
may
adopt
the
temporary
quota
to
eliminate
it
and
it's
our
burden
of
obviously
to
convince
this
court
that
congress
indeed
did
leave
that
area
unregulated
in
1964.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
pointed
out,
there's
no
question
that
until
1964,
companies
and
unions
could
do
this
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
no
matter
what
this
court
decides,
congress
can
easily
clarify
it
if
this
court's
decision
does
not
coincide
with
what
congress
believes
to
be
the
right
result.
the
question
is
that
at
this
moment
in
time
with
the
statute
now
on
the
books,
what
can
we
discern
to
have
been
congress
has
intent
to
date?
and
as
we
read
both
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
title
vii,
the
decision
that
congress
made
in
1964
was
not
to
take
the
choice
to
have
programs
such
as
this
from
the
private
sector.
now,
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
section
703
(a)
and
(d)
do
indeed
say
that
it
will
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
discriminate
against
any
individual
in
employment
and
in
training.
and
so
i
suppose
the
ultimate
question
is,
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
used
the
word
“discriminate”?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
this
statute
only
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
sex,
national
origin,
and
religion,
your
honor,
so
the
employer
is
free
to
discriminate
on
other
grounds.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
sure,
unless
that
would
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
think
unless
it
were
a
subterfuge
for
some
type
of
invidious
discrimination
that
this
statute
proscribes
and
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there's
nothing
in
this
statute
to
preclude
that
your
honor
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
can't
say
that
i
do
but
i
don't
want
to
have
confidence
that
i
know
all
the
statutes
that
i
know
all
the
statutes
that
might
come
into
play.
there
is
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
when
congress
use
the
word
“discriminate”
in
703
(a)
and
(d)
that
it
had
in
mind
what
some
people
have
called
in
invidious
discrimination
not
just
the
literal
sense,
every
choice
you
make
is
an
act
of
discrimination.
congress
talked
about
acts
of
ugliness,
intolerance,
bigotry,
bias,
prejudice,
as
the
kind
of
acts
which
this
statute
was
directed
at.
but
more
than
just
there
is
an
obvious
ambiguity
in
the
word
discriminate
in
703
(a)
and
(d)
and
you'd
want
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
in
any
event
to
find
out
what
congress
intended.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
is
a
race
conscious
decision
which
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
requires
the
selection
of
blacks
rather
than
whites
in
certain
instances.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
in
the
literal
sense,
it
is
discrimination.
as
we
said,
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
but
one
could
say
it
that
way,
our
--
the
defense
would
be
no
more
though
than
simply
saying
that
we
have
a
segregated
workforce
and
we
have
adopted
a
quota
which
does
no
more
than
eliminate
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
that
is
not,
once
we've
shown
that,
that
is
not
discrimination
as
congress
intended
that
term.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mcdonald
prohibits
the
kind
of
discrimination
against
whites
that
congress
passed
this
statute
to
prohibit
against
blacks.
acts
of
ugliness,
intolerance,
bigotry,
bias,
prejudice,
and
the
legislative
history
shows
and
the
legislative
history
from
which
this
court
found
in
mcdonald
that
whites
would
protect
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it's
not
so
much
the
motive.
there
are
certain
acts
taken
in
certain
circumstances
which
congress
did
not
intend
to
fall
within
the
prohibition
of
the
statute.
and
i'd
like
tor
turn,
there
is
another
provision
on
the
face
of
the
statute
terribly
important
to
that
assessment
and
that
is
703
(j),
in
which
congress
said
nothing
in
this
act
requires
an
employer
and
the
union
to
adopt
the
quota
to
eliminate
racial
imbalance.
now,
while
it
may
not
be
definitive
that
it's
worthy
that
way,
it's
hard
to
believe
that
the
drafters
of
that
provision
if
they
thought
it
would
be
unlawful
to
adopt
the
quota
of
this
type
would
have
chosen
the
set
of
words,
nothing
in
this
act
requires
an
employer
and
the
union
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
would
have
been
easy,
your
honor.
it
would
have
been
easier
for
both
us
and
the
court
if
they
had
done
so.
but
we
suggest
that
indeed
in
the
legislative
history,
the
principle
sponsors
made
clear
that
that
is
in
fact
what
they
intended.
now,
it's
an
important
dynamic
to
understanding
that
legislative
history
that
the
balance
of
power
here
was
held
by
a
group
of
conservative
congressman
whose
votes
were
critical
and
who
normally
were
resistant
to
government
regulation
of
business
and
to
state
it
as
the
credo
as
really
the
price
for
their
support
for
this
bill.
but
look,
these
are
evils
and
we
want
to
eradicate
these
evils
and
we
prepared
to
vote
with
you
to
do
so.
but
we've
got
to
do
so
with
the
minimum
intrusion
necessary
upon
management
prerogatives
and
union
freedoms.
and
since
this,
what
we
are
doing
here
was
not
the
evil
which
was
in
congress'
cites
when
they
enacted
the
statute.
it
was
not
the
view
of
these
people
that
the
freedom
which
employers
and
unions
previously
had
to
adopt
the
program
like
this
was
to
be
taken
away.
and
the
most
compelling
evidence
of
that
was
the
explanation
provided
by
representative
macgregor
who
was
one
of
the
leading
house
members
of
the
judiciary
committee
shepherding
this
bill
through.
and
these
were
his
words
spoken
literally
moments
before
the
final
vote
on
this
bill.
indeed,
on
the
same
day,
that
the
bill
was
enacted
and
assigned
by
the
president,
he
said
the
important
is
the
scope
in
extent
of
this
bill
is
it
is
also
vitally
important
that
all
americans
understand
what
this
bill
does
not
cover.
and
he
then
listed
the
areas
of
racial
balancing
in
the
public
schools
and
preferential
treatments
are
quotas
in
employment
and
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
that
linkage.
and
he
said
there
is
a
mistaken
belief
that
congress
is
legislating
in
these
areas
in
this
bill.
when
we
drafted
this
bill,
we
excluded
this
issue.
and
he
went
on
to
say
these
are
controversial
people
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
want
to
say
that
he
would
be.
what
i
want
to
say
is
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
may
have
overstated
my
view.
that
is
a
completely
different
question
from
whether
you
can
do
what
we're
doing.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
except
i
think
if
i
get
to
the
end
of
the
quote,
what
congressman
mcgregor
said
was
that
congress
had
spelled
out.
the
senate
had
spelled
out
in
703
(j)
our
intentions
more
specifically.
and
what
703
(j)
said
was
not,
did
not
address
maintaining
a
racial
balance.
it
said
nothing
in
this
statute
will
require
you
to
adopt
the
quota
to
eliminate
a
racial
imbalance.
and
so
what
congressman
mcgregor
was
saying
is
that's
the
area
we
have
carved
out
and
left
to
the
private
sector.
we've
done
so
not
because
we
think
its
necessary
good
or
necessarily
bad,
but
because
it's
controversial
and
we
decided
not
to
take
that
choice
away
from
where
it
previously
recited
in
the
hands
of
employers
and
unions.
now,
if
i
can
be
allowed,
i
know
i'm
at
my
end,
30
seconds
to
note
the
posture
in
which
this
case
is
really
before
this
court.
there's
a
lot
of
evidence
and
we've
cited
in
our
brief
that
congress
thought
this
to
be
a
controversial
issue
and
concluded
therefore
not
to
embrace
it
within
this
built.
to
leave
it
where
it
had
been.
there'd
been
a
lot
of
briefs
filed
with
this
court
suggesting
cutting
lines
why
you
should
be
allowed
to
have
affirmative
action
in
this
circumstance
but
not
that
one,
all
very
prudential
lines
but
we
submit
not
lines
that
this
court
should
be
drawing
but
that
congress
should
be
drawing.
congress
in
1964
said,
private
parties
are
free
if
they
choose
to
have
affirmative
action
programs.
if
congress
becomes
dissatisfied
with
what
those
private
parties
are
doing,
congress
is
free
to
draw
some
lines.
but
we
submit,
it's
not
for
this
court
to
draw
them,
it's
for
this
court
to
discern
if
we've
accurately
read
the
legislative
history
that
congress
made
a
deliberate
judgment
in
1964.
we
shall
not
regulate.
this
s
not
a
bill
to
forbid
affirmative
action,
this
is
a
bill
to
correct
some
real
evils
that
we
found
and
we've
got
this
other
controversial
question
and
we
choose
to
live
it
for
the
time
being
where
it
was
in
private
hands.
and
on
that
basis,
we
submit
all
affirmative
action
programs
of
this
type
are
lawful.
