justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
grand
jury
of
vote
have
to
unanimous
in
tennessee?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
otherwise
it
takes
a
vote
of
12.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
under
tennessee
law
before
a
person
can
be
tried
for
this
kind
of
an
offense
must
he
be
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
or
can
there
be
an
information?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general
just,
so
i'll
be
sure
i
understand
your
position,
i
had
understood
it
to
be
that
quite
without
regard
to
the
foreman,
let's
assume
that
you
didn't
have
any
foreman,
you
had
a
12-man
jury
that
on,
a
grand
jury
that
indicted
the
defendant
and
there
after
the
defendant
was
tried
before
a
petit
jury,
the
composition
of
which
was
not
questioned
and
the
defendant
was
found
guilty,
and
then
the
case
went
its
way
through
direct
review
and
ends
up
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
and
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
federal
habeas
corpus,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
does
not
apply
to
that
type
situation,
it
cannot
be
invoked
to
review
the
question
whether
or
not
the
grand
jury
was
properly
composed,
is
that
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
i
wonder,
why
you
talk
so
much
about
the
foreman,
i
take
it
that's
an
alternative
position.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
how
many
cases
was
it
extended
to
the
grand
jury
and
habeas
corpus
while
the
composition
of
the
petit
jury
also
had
not
been
attacked.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
how
many?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
question
ever
raised
in
any
of
those
cases.
perhaps
it
was,
i
don't
know,
i
am
asking
for
information.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
kurtz--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
coming
back
to
the
stone
v.
powell
issue
because
i
like
to
ask
you
some
questions
whenever
it's
appropriate.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now
if
you
arguing
another
point
but
you
mentioned
castaneda
and
some
other
cases
a
little
while
ago
and
i
thought
you
are
going
to
continue
with
the
stone
v.
powell
argument.
alright
carry
on
and
let
me
know
when
you
get
to
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
alright.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
we
start
out
by
my
asking
you,
who
was
injured
in
this
case
by
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
having
been
selected
in
a
discriminatory
manner?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
was
he
injured?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
were
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
in
what
respect?
are
you
challenging
the
composition
of
the
petty
jury?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
any
error
before
us
today
in
the
trial
that
you
are
citing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
stand
here
today
challenging
only
the
validity
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
again
i
ask
you
how
was
your
client
injured
if
he
was
tried
and
convicted
by
a
jury
properly
selected?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
were
your
clients
rights
violated
in
terms
of
judicial
integrity
as
you
use
that
term
anymore
than
the
public
generally?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
concede
your
client
had
fair
trial
and
he
was
found
guilty,
that
guilt
has
been
affirmed
by
at
least
three
courts.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you're
not
challenging
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
what
is
the
purpose,
the
historical
purpose
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
had
something
to
do
with
innocence,
didn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
innocence
involved
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
alright.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
is
there
any
unlawful
confinement
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
indictment.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
is
the
first
case
you
rely
upon?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
attack
that
was
on
the
petty
jury
as
well
as
the
grand
jury.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
was
the
next
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
the
issue
you're
arguing
here
today
argued
in
that
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
case
was
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
that
a
habeas
corpus
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that's
a
very
different
case
then.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
novel
case
in
that
respect.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
my
point.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
kurtz.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
a
question,
obviously
the
integrity
of
the
grand
jury
is
important
to
society
no
one
questions
that,
what
other
ways
may
the
grand
jury
integrity
be
protected
legally
apart
from
the
type
of
action
that
you
have
here
today?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
turner
against
fouche.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right
and
of
course
they
can
be
direct
attack
on
direct
appeal.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
state
courts
and
this
court
also.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
at
least
three
other
ways
without
resorting
to
habeas
corpus.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
issue
as
to
full
and
fair
trail
as
i
have
understood
it
didn't
relate
to
whether
or
not
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
had
been
properly
selected,
the
issue
so
far
has
habeas
corpus
being
a
proper
remedy
it
relates
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
full
and
fair
trial
of
the
defendant
by
the
petit
jury
and
the
judge
who
presided
over
it.
