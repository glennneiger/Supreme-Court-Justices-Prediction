mr.
william
m.
leech
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
had
its
origin,
or
its
genesis
in
late
october
of
1972,
when
the
respondents
in
this
case
were
arrested
for
murder
in
shelby
county
for
a
homicide
committed
in
tipton
county,
tennessee.
they
were
indicted
on
november
of
1972,
before
the
grand
jury
of
tipton
county
which
was
chaired
by
an
acting
foreman
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
trial
judge
under
tennessee
system
of
appointing
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury.
the
acting
foreman
was
accompanied
on
the
grand
jury
by
12
other
grand
jurors
selected
from
the
general
venire
list
of
tipton
county.
there
was
a
pro
se
plea
in
abatement
to
that
indictment.
a
hearing
was
held
in
the
trial
court
and
evidence
was
taken,
the
trial
judge
overruled
the
plea.
it
went
on
to
trial
and
the
conviction
was
had
against
both
respondents
and
each
was
sentenced
to
60
years.
the
respondents
then
perfected
their
appeal
to
the
intermediate
court
of
criminal
appeals,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
considered
the
same
assignments
of
error
in
their
original
plea
which
attacked
the
method
of
selecting
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
and
that
the
plea
originally
alleged
systematic
exclusion
in
the
appointment
of
the
acting
grand
jury
by
the
trial
judge.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
favorable
for
the
state
and
against
the
plea,
it
then
was
appealed
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court
certiorari
was
denied
and
a
per
curium
opinion.
the
court
found
that
the
case
had
been
adequately
dealt
with
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
thereafter
in
1975
petitions
were
filed
by
respondents
and
the
district
court
at
memphis
for
petitions
of
habeas
corpus,
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
thereafter
the
reference
to
the
magistrate
was
had
by
judge
bailey
brown
on
the
bench
and
the
magistrate
did
take
proof,
responses,
the
trial
were
filed,
the
trial
record
was
filed
and
affidavits
were
submitted.
subsequently
the
case
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
and
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
had
been
selected
for
other
reasons
than
racial.
in
essence
the
proof
before
the
court
at
that
time
was
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
had
selected
the
acting
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
because
of
his
prior
experience
in
the
satisfactory
manner
in
which
he
had
performed
that
duty.
petition
to
rehear
was
filed
before
the
district
court
which
was
further
considered
and
overruled
and
then
the
appeal
of
course
was
taken
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
action
of
the
federal
district
court
at
memphis
was
reversed
and
the
sixth
circuit
did
find
that
there
was
a
systematic
exclusion
in
the
selection
of
foreman
of
the
grand
jury.
our
arguments
and
contentions
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
tennessee
basically
are
--
that
judge
brown’s
finding
was
correct.
and
that
the
foreman
was
selected
for
reasons
other
than
racial
and
that
the
foreman
had
been
selected
acting
foreman
to
fill
the
vacancy
of
the
normal
foreman
who
was
unavailable
during
that
term
of
court
and
the
trial
judge
affidavits
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
foreman
of
that
grand
jury
both
indicated
that
it
was
for
prior
experience
and
satisfactory
work
well
done.
further
at
that
time
it
should
be
noted
that
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
did
not
vote
in
indictment.
the
indictment
can
--
the
voting
of
the
indictment
was
by
12
grand
jurors
who
were
selected
from
the
general
venire
list,
raised
further
that
the
record
indicates
that
the
raise
of
the
defendants
who're
respondents
here
was
unknown
to
them
at
that
time
and
that
there
was
no
mention
or
there
was
no
alluding
to
the
race
of
the
respondent
defendants.
mr.
william
m.
leech
no
sir
it
requires
that
12
grand
jurors
indict.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir
and
the
foreman
is
under
tennessee
law
the
13th
grand
juror
and
may
vote.
mr.
william
m.
leech
must
be
grand
jury
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir,
yes
sir
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir.
the
record
does
show
that
the
race
of
the
victims
was
also
black,
as
was
the
race
of
the
respondent
defendants.
mr.
william
m.
leech
no
sir,
your
honor.
the
court
below
did
hold
that
a
prima
facie
case
was
made
out
by
the
statement
of
the
prior
grand
jury
foreman
--
some
three
to
four
in
number,
who
said
that
their
recollection,
there
had
never
been
black
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
in
tipton
county.
and
i
think
that
did
make
--
we
do
not
contest
that,
no
sir.
mr.
william
m.
leech
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
not
in
the
record
and
i
have
no
personal
recollection.
mr.
william
m.
leech
no
sir,
either
way.
frankly
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
tipton
county
it's
in
upper
west
tennessee
across
the
mississippi
river
from
missouri
land.
it's
probably
closer
to
the
st.
louis
than
it
is
to
nashville.
the
other
--
i
would
also
add
one
witness
testified
before
this
grand
jury
panel,
that
witness
was
the
arresting
officer,
after
that
a
boat
was
taken
without
--
although
there
were
some
20
other
witnesses
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
at
that
term.
at
the
trial,
there
were
some
five
eyewitnesses
as
to
both
defendants.
we
contend
that
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
finding
that
it
was
based
on
pragmatic
reasons
and
neutralized
or
was
neutral
to
the
race
issue.
second
argument
that
we
put
forth
is
that
even
assuming
that
error
existed
and
there
was
systematic
exclusion
in
the
selection
of
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury,
that
it
would
be
harmless
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
when
the
record
is
viewed
on
the
whole
with
the
evidence
of
guilt
being
overwhelming
at
trial,
free
of
reversible
constitutional
error
and
free
of
any
constitutional
error
as
to
the
petit
jury
makeup
or
to
the
grand
jury
makeup
as
to
the
--
who
were
selected
from
the
general
venire
list.
the
third
argument
in
position
which
the
state
puts
forth
is
that
the
federal
habeas
corpus
should
be
limited
when
the
--
when
we
have
an
issue
involving
the
selection
of
the
foreman
of
a
grand
juror
who
is
one
of
13
with
12
voting
members
and
an
opportunity
has
been
had
for
a
full
and
fair
litigation
in
the
state
system
which
tennessee
has
a
three
tired
court
system
from
the
trial,
actual
trial
before
the
jury
of
a
criminal
offense
and
further
an
extensive
post
conviction
relief
act,
that
further
that
if
the
trial
is
free
from
constitutional
reversible
error
and
no
assignments
are
made
to
the
petit
jury
or
to
the
petit
jury
--
in
essence
an
extension
of
the
stone,
the
stone
versus
powell
case.
we
say
this
knowing
that
this
is
the
first
time
to
our
knowledge
--
to
my
knowledge
that
squarely
there's
been
any
extension
of
the
rationale
in
neil
from
1881
to
extend
to
the
foreman
selection
of
a
grand
jury.
mr.
william
m.
leech
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
the
statutory
prescription
of
the
foreman's
duty
is
in
the
record
further
the--
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes,
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
did
submit
an
affidavit
before
the
federal
magistrate
at
the
district
court
level
in
which
he
stated
in
this
case
that
he
did
not
vote
and
that
he
did
preside
basically
we
contend
that
the
foreman's
chore
is
basically
ministerial
and
administrative
and
that
it
assists
in
the
organizing
of
the
grand
jury
scheduling
of
witnesses.
he
stated
that
since
he
had
been
serving
his
former,
the
grand
jury
which
had
been
many
years
under
tennessee
system,
they
are
usually
reappointed
as
for
statement
of
trial,
he
had
never
voted
except
in
one
case.
mr.
william
m.
leech
no
sir,
he
schedules
the
witnesses,
he
schedules
the
witnesses
who
are
to
appear,
he
asks
them
questions
and
then
he
turns
to
the
other
members
of
the
grand
jury
and
ask
them
if
they
have
any
questions
of
the
witness.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir,
he
is
chairman
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
william
m.
leech
no
sir,
under
tennessee
law
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
he
schedules
them
or
does
the
ministerial
function
of
calling
them.
mr.
william
m.
leech
mr.
justice
marshall
he
does
not
make
the
--
he
is
not
the
solo
arbiter
of
who
testify
--
any
grand
juror
can
insist
on
or
ask
to
hear
from
a
witness,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
most
district
attorney's
general
who
have
charge
of
the
grand
jury
schedule
and
report
on
the
indictment
form
who
the
witnesses
are
as
a
result
of
the
investigation
from
the
law
enforcement
officer.
the
foreman
does
work
closely
with
the
district
attorney
general
during
the,
when
the
grand
jury
is
not
in
session.
in
many
of
tennessee's
counties
the
grand
juries
are
not
in
continuous
session.
of
course
in
the
metropolitan
areas
such
as
nashville,
and
memphis,
and
chattanooga,
they
are
in
continuous
session
and
there
are
usually
two
grand
juries
operating
continuously.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir
on
the
grand
jury,
on
the
grand
jury,
we
would
on
to
the
rationale
encompassed
in
stone
and
that
tennessee
has
a
full
and
fair
trial
and
appellate
practice
and
is
more
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
under
habeas
corpus,
there
is
a
collateral
tag,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
leech
i
would
say
of
course
there
is
a
line
at
some
point
in
which
we,
there
is
a
breaking
point,
obviously
we
haven't
gone
to
the
arresting
officer,
we
haven't
gone
to
the
committing
magistrate
in
the
manner
in
which
that
individual
is
selected.
there
must
be
a
breaking
point,
our
position
is
that
that
breaking
point
should
be
after
the
petit
jury,
for
that
relief.
i
am
candid
to
say
that
if
the
matter
was
brought
before
the
tennessee
appellate
court
and
systematic
exclusion
was
shown,
systematic
exclusions
of
blacks
to
be,
to
serve
as
grand
jurors,
it
should
--
i
maintain
should
be
reversed
by
the
court,
but
as
a
collateral
attachment
there
is
–
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
leech
in
this
particular
case,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
we
just
simply
say
that
since
it
has
never
been
extended
to
the
foreman
it
has
been
extended
as
has
been
pointed
out
to
grand
jury
composition--
mr.
william
m.
leech
a
number
of
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
i
really
don't
know
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
i
really
don't
know
as
to
the
numerical
breakdown.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
that's
correct.
we
are
saying
first
that
federal
habeas
corpus
should
not
be
the
writ
available
for
a
collateral
attack
on
the
grand
jury
composition
itself
in
the
absence
of
--
the
other
fact
is
that,
that
we
discussed
in
stone
versus
powell
or
more
particularly
where
there
has
been
a
full
and
fair
and
impartial
trial
and
appellate
review
and
we
first
say
that
but
then
we
also
say
that
we
certainly
assuming
this
certainly
we
should
not
depart
an
extended
to
include
even
the
selection
of
a
foreman.
mr.
william
m.
leech
on
the
basis
of
constitutional
issue.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir.
also
that's
other
in
addition
to
the
federal
district
judge
being
correct
in
finding
that
the
prima
facie
case
was
rebutted
by
neutral
evidence,
the
decision
was
made
for
other
reasons
other
than
racial.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir
in
the
absence
of
an
actual
showing
of
prejudice
which
i
cannot
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
in
the
absence
of
an
actual
showing
of
prejudice.
mr.
william
m.
leech
well,
if
indictment
itself
is
faulty
in
tennessee
law,
whatever
occurred
in
the
trial
is
void
because
a
defendant
cannot
stand
trial
in
tennessee
without
first
being
indicted
and
so
if
the
indictment
is
faulty
and
it
is
shown
that
it
is
defective
even
in
state
court.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes,
it's
a
matter
of
state
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
no
sir,
not
in
state
court.
in
state
court,
if
you
could
show
that
the
defendant
on
trial
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
leech
i
request
to
reserve
few
moments
in
rebuttal.
mr.
william
m.
leech
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
court.
just
very
briefly
i
would
conclude
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
have
not
always
universally,
uniformly
been
protected
by
vehicle
of
habeas
corpus
such
as
where
a
state
law
requires
that
the
plea
be
filed
in
advance
and
if
it
isn't
done,
then
the
individual
will
be
barred
from
raising
it
for
not
having
raised
it
timely.
another
is
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
guilty
plea
as
in
pollock
(ph)
and
where
guilty
plea
some
20
years
later
the
defendant
could
not
come
back
to
be
heard
and
i
would
simply
say
that
there
are
other
means
for
attacking
discrimination
in
the
systematic
exclusions
of
members
of
recognized
classes
from
participation
in
society
whether
it
be
the
appointee,
whether
or
not
it's
a
school
board
appointment
or
whether
it
affects
the
judiciary,
if
it
affects
the
judiciary,
then
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
involved
may
by
its
inherent
rule
making
power
promulgate
guidelines
and
procedures
to
follow
for
the
trial
bench
and
the
functioning
through
its
appointed
powers.
in
addition
to
the
class
action
in
the
traditional
legal
note--
mr.
william
m.
leech
oh
no
sir
i
said
the
state
court,
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
tennessee
perceives
that,
this
is
a
state
wide
system
we
have,
and
perceives
that
there
have
been
numerous
violations
or
its
not
working
as
a
system
because
the
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
that's
the
heart
of
the
matter,
yes
sir
i
would
say
that
as
opposes
the
deterrent
factor
under
which
the
rationale
of
federal
habeas
corpus
has
been
used
here
for
in
fourteenth
amendment
question.
we
are
simply
saying
in
modern
context
today
that
ample
remedy
is
available
and
that
--
in
this
kind
of
case
where
a
full
and
fair,
impartial
hearing
has
already
transpired
that
should
be
limited.
mr.
william
m.
leech
he
was
passing
on
the
plea
in
abatement
which
went
to
the
selection
of
the
foreman
juror
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
--
which
would
be
his
appointment,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
leech
your
honor,
he
would
be
trying
the
issue
presented
to
him
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was,
and
he
did
submit
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
once
much
--
if
your
honor
please
once
it
might
fall
in
the
proper
procedures
so
much
it
was
the
charge
of
being
discriminating
by
intentionally
and
excluding
black
and
i
don't
think
that
when
his
affidavit
is
read
as
a
whole
submitted
into
the
record
is
what
he
said,
simply
said
he
seldom
ever
appointed
people
and
when
he
did
he
simply
reappointed
those
who
had
been
there
and
then
he
had
to
consider.
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir
and
then
he
also
presided
to
go
further
as
a
trial
judge
for
the
petit
jury
but
then
that
was
reviewed
by
criminal
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
the
entire
record
and
the
supreme
court
in
reviewing
the
record.
mr.
william
m.
leech
on
the
merits
of
the
indictment
--
mr.
william
m.
leech
yes
sir
and
