justice
potter
stewart
he
sits
out
as
a
chairman
or
the
president?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it's
and
on
the
basis
of,
it
was
harmless
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
potter
stewart
and
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
argument
would
it
not
always
be
true
that's
any
defect
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding
will
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
if
you
got
a
finding
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
the
trial
by
the
petit
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
there
ever
be
one
on
the
man
that's
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that'll
be
guilty.
so
doesn't
that
position
--
wouldn't
that
position
effectively
give
the
state
a
free
hand
in
doing
whatever
it
want
to
do
with
grand
juries?
justice
potter
stewart
well
even
if
there
was
prejudice
would
then
still
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
is
prejudice
at
the
grand
jury
stage
because
--
if
the
man
had
a
fair
trial,
if
we
assume
the
man
had
a
fair
trial
was
found
guilty.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
although
i
would
hesitate
saying
it
possible
because
i
could
envision
some
grand
jury
participation
beyond
their
regular
role
or
--.
justice
potter
stewart
well
habeas
corpus
has
to
do
with
release
from
unlawful
confinement
that
may
or
may
not
have
something
to
do
with
innocence
in
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
released
from
unlawful
confinement
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
sometime
it
has
to
do
with
the
innocence,
sometimes
it
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
had
to
do
with
the
exclusionary
rule
and
it
did
as
my
brother
rehnquist
correctly
recollects,
emphasize
the
interest
of
juridical
integrity
in
connection
with
the
exclusionary
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is,
i
would
corollary
to
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general,
you
are
not
suggesting
this
court
to
promulgate
rules
for
the
tennessee
courts
to
follow,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
as
in
this
case
where
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
perceived
there
was
no
problem
and
federal
judges
thought
there
was
a
problem.
then
would,
doesn't
that
--
the
heart
of
the
matter?
justice
potter
stewart
well
is
it,
it
is
generally
considered
a
full
fair
and
impartial
hearing
when
the
judge
who's
conduct
in
under
review
is
the
judge
who
is
reviewing
that
conduct,
which
is
what
we
had
here.
the
trial
judge
was
passing
on
the
sufficiency
of
his
own
handling
of
the
matter,
wasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
which
he
had
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
normally
that
a
fair
and
adequate
--
full
and
fair
hearing
of
the
issue
when
you
have
this
--
the
judge
trying
himself
in
effect?
justice
potter
stewart
the
challenge
was
that
he
had
not
followed
a
proper
procedure,
that
was
the
challenge
and
then
he
is
the
one
who
decided
whether
or
not
he
followed
a
proper
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he
reviewed
his
own
affidavit
and
decided
that
that
didn't
show
discrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
a
different
test
in
the
stone
against
powell
test,
on
the
stone
against
powell,
the
issue
on
the
full
and
fair
hearing
isn't
just
a
trial
it's
whether
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
issue
whether
or
not
the
evidence
had
been
illegally
seized,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
you
are
asking
for
or
you
are
just
saying
whenever
there
is
a
fair
trial
that's
the
end
of
the
matter,
it's
kind
of
an
extension
as
stone
against
powell?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
in
order
for
your
theory
of
stone
against
powell
to
apply,
we
would
have
to
decide
if
there
was
a
full
and
fair
hearing
by
the
judge
on
the
issue
of
discrimination
in
picking
the
grand
jury
foreman.
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well
let's
make
it
precise.
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
was
a
not
a
full
and
fair
hearing
at
the
trial
court
level
in
the
state
system
on
the
question
whether
the
grand
jury
foreman
had
been
picked
improperly.
if
there
was
not
a
full
and
fair
hearing
by
the
trial
judge
in
tennessee,
would
or
would
not
stone
against
powell
bar
review,
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
i
say
would
it
be
reviewed
on
the
federal
court
on
that
hypothesis?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
would
say
stone
against
powell
would
bar
it
even
if
there
was
not
a
fair
hearing
by
the
state
trial
judge
on
the
issue
raised
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
