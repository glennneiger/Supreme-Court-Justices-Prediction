mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
simply
i
feel
the
enforcement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
federal
courts.
the
court
of
appeals
found
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
the
respondents
and
reversed
their
convictions.
the
respondents
are
asking
you
to
affirm
that
judgment.
i
see
the
issues
as
being
three.
one
whether
there
was
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
foreman.
if
so,
what
is
the
proper
remedy?
and
then
the
third
issue
the
stone
versus
powell
issue
is
federal
habeas
corpus
available
in
this
kind
of
issue?
now
the
attorney
general
has
conceived
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well,
i
had
planned
to
begin
with
the
discrimination
issue
in
my
argument,
but
of
course
logically
if
your
honors
were
to
expand
stone
versus
powell.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
the
jurisdiction
--
no,
the
habeas
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
had
planned
to
begin
with
the
discrimination
issue
and
i'll
do
so,
but
i
do
concede
that
point
of
course.
the
attorney
general
has
conceded
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
proven
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
judge
found
it
to
be
a
prima
facie
case
and
of
course
obviously
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
however
disagreed
on
whether
the
prima
facie
case
was
rebutted.
now
what
did
the
state
produce
in
the
district
court
in
an
effort
to
rebut
the
prima
facie
case?
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
your
honor
it
covered
a
period
of
time
from
the
early
‘50s
to
1972,
i
say
the
early
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
that's
what
the
court
of
appeal
found
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
nobody
has
found
there
to
be
gaps,
but
i
--
but
there
were
three
grand
--
prior
grand
jury
foreman
testifying,
one
who
would
served
in
early
‘50s,
all
of
them
testified
that
it
was
in
their
memory
they
could
not
recall
a
black
grand
jury
foreman.
i
suppose
it's
possible
that
there
was
a
grand
jury
foreman
who
served
in
that
period
of
time
not
called
and
in
that
respect
there
maybe
a
gap,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
i
don't
recall
that
your
honor.
as
i
recall
the
record
all
three
said
that
they
could
not
--
they
did
not
believe
there
had
ever
been
a
black
grand
jury
foreman.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
no
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
am
from
nashville,
which
is
approximately
180
miles
from
tipton
county
and
have
no
personal
knowledge
as
the
attorney
general,
it's
a
good
deal
geographically
remote
from
where
i
am.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
covington,
tennessee
is
the
county
seat
your
honor
and
i
would
correct
the
attorney
general
on
one
thing,
tipton
county
does
border
on
shelby
county
and
rather
being
in
northwest
corner
it
is
in
the
southwest
corner
of
the
state.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
your
honor.
some
republicans
there.
i
will
return
to
the
state's
efforts
to
rebut
the
prima
facie
case
in
the
federal
district
court.
they
submitted
an
affidavit
from
the
state
trial
judge
in
which
the
state
trial
judge
says
that
he
had
chosen
the
grand
jury
foreman
that
indicted
the
respondents
because
this
individual
had
served
before
and
his
regular
foreman
was
going
to
be
out
of
the
county.
then
he
sums
up
in
last
sentence
of
his
affidavit,
quote,
this
in
the
appendix
of
page
113.
“i
don't
think
i
have
really
given
any
thought
to
appointing
a
black
foreman,
but
i
have
no
feeling
against
doing
so.”
he'd
never
given
any
thought
to
the
appointing
of
a
black
grand
jury
foreman.
the
state
also
submitted
the
affidavit
of
the
grand
jury
foreman
who
tells
us
that
he
did
not
vote
on
the
indictment.
now
once
a
prima
facie
case
is
shown,
i
say
the
state
has
a
much
greater
obligation
then
to
just
come
into
court
with
an
affidavit
of
the
selecting
officer
saying
that
he
didn't
choose
this
person
because
of
race.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
affidavit
is
much
stronger
than
that
because
the
affidavit
indicates
that
he
did
not
even
consider
blacks,
but
what
didn't
they
show?
there
was
no
proof
that
a
black
had
ever
been
considered.
no
proof
that
a
black
had
ever
served.
no
proof
as
to
what
criteria
was
used.
no
proof
of
any
rational
selection
procedure
like
personal
interviews
etcetera,
and
there
are
absolutely
certainly
no
proof
that
the
blacks
in
tipton
county
were
unqualified
to
serve.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
i
don't
think
so
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
in
tennessee
judges
are
elected.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well,
that's
certainly
true
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
involved
itself
in
the
motivation
of
individual
voters
that
comprise
an
electorate.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
it
may
not
stop
me
mr.
chief
justice,
but
of
course
i'm
not
here
to
argue
that
point.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
but
i
do
think
that
selection
process
there
is
certainly
different.
certainly
susceptible
to
the
exercise
of
racial
prejudice,
but
nothing
to
which
this
court
has
ever
entered
into,
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
be
proper
for
the
court
to
enter
into
that
to
sort
of
political,
almost
a
political
judgment
as
to
why
voters
are
motivated
to
elect
who
they
do.
now
the
prima
facie
case
is
important
and
what
the
state
failed
to
prove
is
important
because
the
prima
facie
case
shifts
the
burden
of
proof.
now
the
judge
did
tell
us
that
he
did
not
consider
blacks.
he
gave
them
no
thought.
a
person
who
selects
members
of
the
grand
jury
has
a
duty
to
become
familiar
with
persons
eligible
for
duty,
for
jury
service,
a
duty
to
refrain
from
a
course
of
conduct
that
naturally
gives
–
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
no
i
guess
i
used
that
and
it's
sort
of
generic
term
your
honor.
i
am
talking
about
the
grand
jury
foreman.
but
a
duty
to
refrain
from
a
course
of
conduct,
and
this
court's
cases
had
never
allowed
a
simple
protestation
that
i
didn't
mean
to
discriminate
to
be
sufficient
to
over
come
a
prima
facie
case.
and
in
this
case
we
have
far
more
than
a
simple
protestation
that
i
didn't
mean
to
discriminate,
we
have
a
statement
that
i
did
not
consider
blacks,
i
didn't
give
them
any
thought
although
i
don't
have
anything
against
it.
i
think
we
clearly
proved
a
case
of
discrimination.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
the
petit
jury
is
chosen
from
the
master
jury
list
or
venire
your
honor
and
it
comes
from
the
same
basic
path
of
jurors
that
the
grand
jurors
are
drawn
from.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
commissioners
chose
the
master
jury
list,
but
then
as
i
recall
the
clerk
administers
a
system
by
which
names
are
put
in
a
pot
and
until
recently
a
10
year
old
child
was
brought
in
and
drew
out
names
at
random.
they
went
to
serve
the
grand
jury,
they
went
to
serve
the
criminal
court
juries,
the
civil
court
juries.
but
then
completely
outside
of
that
is
the
judges'
personal
sort
of
selection
procedure
where
he
can
reach
out
into
the
general
population
and
choose
anybody
he
or
she
wants
as
a
foreman
or
a
fore
person
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well
i
don't
believe
it's
a
clearly
erroneous
test
your
honor,
because
for
one
thing
there
is
no
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court,
none
whatsoever
it
was
based
solely
upon
the
statistical
information
available
that
there
hadn't
been
any
blacks,
the
judge,
and
the
judges'
affidavit.
so
i
don't
think
a
clearly
erroneous
rule
applies
for
an
additional
reason.
also
in
that
we
have
mixed
questions
of
law
in
fact
here
obviously
and
clearly
erroneous
rule
does
not
apply
to
that.
and
also
district
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
they
felt
confident
that
the
district
judge
had
applied
the
facts
or
the
law
improperly
to
the
facts.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
your
honor
and
i
do
disagree
with
you
that
the
district
court
did
not
find
a
prima
facie
case.
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
the
district
courts
decision
on
page
99
of
the
appendix
the
first
paragraph,
this
is
a
district
court
judge
saying
it
would
appear
that
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
with
respect
to
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
foreman
of
the
grand
jury.
only
then
that
the
district
judge
allowed
the
state
an
opportunity
to
file
affidavits
and
only
then
did
the
state
file
the
affidavit
of
the
district
court
judge
or
excuse
me,
the
affidavit
of
the
state
court
judge
and
the
affidavit
of
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
your
honor.
now
let
me
turn
quickly
to
the
issue
of
relief,
which
i
think
is
one
of
the
key
issues
in
this
case,
obviously
and
i
suppose
what
legitimately,
the
legitimate
questions
about
the
fact
that
the
foreman
did
not
vote
in
this
matter.
the
traditional
remedy
has
always
been
avoiding
the
indictment
for
discrimination
in
grand
jury
cases
as
well
as
petit
jury.
but
many
of
this
court's
cases
have
involved
solely
grand
juries.
bush
versus
kentucky
the
first
one
that
involved
solely
a
grand
jury
1883
and
then
through
more
recent
cases
alexander
versus
louisiana,
peters
versus
kiff
and
then
castaneda.
what
are
the
importances
of
the
grand,
the
foremen
in
this
case?
the
record
in
that
regard
does
not
contain
many
facts,
the
only
thing
we
know
on
page
23
of
the
appendix
is
the
foreman
who
served
at
the
--
at
this
particular
grand
jury
panel
is
--
i
usually
question
the
witness
first
to
get
basic
information
to
the
attention
of
the
members
of
the
grand
jury
and
then
i
ask
each
witness
has
been
examined
if
there
is
anyone
in
the
room
that
wants
to
ask
further
question
to
the
witness.
they
are
--
each
and
everyone
given
an
opportunity
to
question
the
witness,
so
he
controls
the
availability
of
the
witness
and
when
to
break
off
the
giving
of
evidence.
but
what
more
does
he
or
she
do?
under
tennessee
law,
the
grand
jury
is
an
entity
made
up
of
13
members
the
foreman
is
the
presiding
officer
and
leader
of
the
grand
jury.
small
group
studies
and
small
group
dynamics
would
certainly
indicate
the
force
that
a
leader
of
such
a
small
group
can
exercise
and
all
of
us
who
practiced
criminal
law
and
have
some
knowledge
of
grand
juries
and
petit
juries
realize
that
the
tremendous
influence
of
the
foreman
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
that
is
also
true
in
tennessee.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well
we
don't
know
exactly
what
goes
on
but
i
think
that
we
are
well
aware
of
certainly
the
power
of
the
foreman
of
the
petit
jury,
the
power
of
any
chairman
or
leader
of
a
small
group
and
we
can
extrapolate
from
that
as
to
the
power
of
the
foreman.
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
no
your
honor,
i
don't
suggest
that
and
i
don't
disagree
with
what
the
attorney
general
said
about
that.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
that
is
the
matter
of
law
but
i
think
as
a
matter
of
just
controlling
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well
absolutely.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
that
is
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
tennessee
is
not
different
in
that
regard
your
honor,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
create
an
impression
of
--
but
i
wanted
to
impart
the
information
that
the
foreman
does
occupy
most
important
role.
in
this
particular
case,
the
foreman
interviewed
the
witnesses
ahead
of
time
and
brought
them
in.
but
i
don't
suggest
that
the
foreman
is
more
powerful
in
that
regard
than
say
the
district
attorney
general.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
your
honor
i
will
reach
that,
but
of
course
i'd
be
glad
to
address
it
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
i
will
definitely
get
to
it
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
i
just
--
further
more
the
grand
jury
foreman
must
sign
indictment
in
tennessee
or
the
indictment
is
void
even
if
the
grand
jury
foreman
does
not
vote
and
of
course
the
grand
jury
foreman
has
certain
statutory
duties
even
out
of
term.
i
think
all
these
things
are
outlined
in
great
detail
in
the
briefs
of
this
case.
why
the
voiding
of
the
indictment?
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
your
honor.
that
the
foreman
is
the
spokesperson
of
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
can
only
act
vis-à-vis
the
court
through
the
foreman,
but
i
don't
suggest
that
the
foreman
could
somehow
refuse
to
sign.
he
would
have
to
sign
or
i
assume
he'd
subject
to
mandamus.
this
court
has
always
supported
the
remedy
of
the
voiding
of
indictments
by
two
theories,
both
used
i
think,
the
presumption
of
prejudice.
certain
circumstances
are
so
susceptible
to
abuse
that
the
court
will
assume
prejudice.
i
think
it
is
the
recognition
of
the
evidentiary
problems
that
are
present
and
if
you
had
to
prove
actual
discriminations
in
court.
grand
jury
secrecy,
most
difficult.
in
the
castaneda
case
for
instance,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
proof
of
actual
prejudice.
this
court
has
always
assumed
that
to
be
a
legitimate
rationale
in
support
of
that
rule.
then
the
rule
of
judicial
integrity.
while
the
rationale
of
judicial
integrity
has
fallen
in
--
well
bad
times
in
the
fourth
amendment
area,
it
has
not
fallen
in
bad
times
in
this
area.
for
instance,
in
your
honor's
case
peters
versus
kiff,
you
allowed
a
white
defendant
standing
to
challenge
grand
jury
discrimination
because
blacks
have
been
excluded.
i
think
that,
that
is
a
strong
statement
that
this
court
adheres
to
the
rationale
of
judicial
integrity.
chief
justice
stone
said
in
an
older
case
hill
versus
texas,
the
conviction
cannot
stand
because
the
constitution
prohibits
the
procedure
by
which
it
was
obtained.
equal
protection
of
the
law
is
something
more
than
an
abstract
right,
it
is
a
command
which
the
state
must
respect
the
benefits
of
which
every
person
may
demand.
not
the
least
of
our
constitutional
system
is
that
its
safeguards
extent
to
all,
the
lease
deserving
as
well
as
the
most
virtuous.
and
mr.
justice
powell
i
will
turn
to
the
stone
argument,
which
i
think
is
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
i
think
the
defendants.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
both
of
them
were
injured
your
honor
because
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
their
personal
fourteenth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
no
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
no
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well,
again
i
must
say
because
their
personal
fourteenth
amendments
rights
were
violated.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well,
i
think
they
were
both
violated
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
for
purposes
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
for
purpose
of
this
hearing
i
do
not
challenge
that
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well,
i
believe
the
historical
purpose
of
habeas
corpus
prior
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
your
honor,
it
had
something
to
do
with
innocence
and
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
no
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
but
habeas
corpus
law
has
changed
considerably
since
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
innocence
as
you
say
and
also
it
has
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
and
congress
is
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
your
honor.
if
you
--
if
we
look
back
over
100
years
of
this
court's
decisions
enforcing
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
conviction
was
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
therefore
under
the
federal
habeas
statute
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well,
there
would
be
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
i
would
start
with
strauder
versus
west
virginia
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
bush
versus
kentucky,
which
as
an
1883
case,
in
which
the
attack
was
solely
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
no,
your
honor
but
there
is
a
case
in
which
the
issue
that
interests
your
honor
was
argued.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
and
that
is
cassell
versus
texas.
a
1950
case.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
the
issue
on
habeas
corpus
has
never
been
addressed
by
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
but
i
would
like
to
submit
that
there
are
tremendous
differences
in
this
case
and
stone
versus
powell,
which
should
not
lead
to
the
same
result.
they
are
the
differences
between
the
exclusionary
rule
and
the
remedy
in
this
case.
the
rationales
are
different.
the
rationale
of
voiding
the
indictment
in
this
case
is
supported
by
presumed
prejudice,
judicial
integrity
and
maybe
deterrence,
but
only
maybe
possibly
deterrence.
now,
this
court's
decisions
have
never
rested
on
that.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
based
on
deterrence
alone
and
the
recognition
that
deterrence
--
the
deterrent
effect
is
attenuated
so
greatly
on
federal
habeas
corpus
that
in
a
balancing
procedure,
this
court
recognizes
that
there
are
certain
interests
more
important
than
the
deterrent
effects
in
enforcement
--
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
no,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
but
as
i
read
stone
versus
powell,
your
honor's
have
rejected
such
irrational
in
the
area
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
if
not
rejecting
it
certainly
entered
into
a
balancing
test,
a
balancing
test
that
has
never
been
used
by
this
court
in
grand
jury
discrimination
cases.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well
i
certainly
recognize
that
and
support
it,
but
i
don't
think
that,
that
rationale
is
supported
by
this
court's
decision
in
stone
versus
powell.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
i
think
that
that
could
raise
substantial
questions
as
to
the
validity
of
the
charges
if
it
was
shown
that
the
racial
discrimination
had
been
exercised
in
the
selection
of
the
prosecutors.
i
would
admit
that
that
would
raise
tremendous
difficulties
in
our
system
of
justice,
that
obviously
would
not
be
as
easy
to
administer
as
this
rule
is
in
the
grand
jury.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
that's
possible.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
well
of
course
the
grand
jury
integrity
could
be
protected
by
federal
criminal
statute,
there
is
such
statute
18
u.s.
code
243.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
class
action
law
suits
as
used
in
carter
versus
the
jury
commissioner.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
your
honor,
the
canyon
case.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
in
the
state
court.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
kurtz
that's
correct,
there
are
alternatives
available
but
i
think
that
there
are
legitimate
differences
between
the
exclusionary
rule
and
the
rule
in
this
case
it
does
not
appear
that
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
and
my
time
is
up
now,
thank
you
very
much.
