justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
i
may
have
missed
your
stating
at
--
but
does
the
record
show
the
race
of
the
victims
in
this
murder
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
challenge
incidentally
the
conclusions
of
the
court
below
that
the
respondents
made
out
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
you
are
saying
there
hasn't
been
any
extension
--
to
a
foreman.
but
wouldn't
your
position
on
the
stone
against
powell
issue
be
the
same
with
respect
to
challenging
the
composition
of
the
entire
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
issue
on
the
grand
jury
just
wouldn't
be
open
in
federal
collateral
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
position
does
encompass
that,
that
and
so
it
really
--
well
i
take
it
you
are
saying
that
even
if
stone
against
powell
would
pick
up
challenges
to
the
grand
jury
in
general,
it
shouldn't
pick
up
challenges
to
the
foreman
is
that
it
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
should
they
both
be
treated
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
federal
habeas
corpuses
has
been
available
on
the
grand
jury
for
a
long
time,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
but
that's
on
the
basis
and
a
constitutional
issue,
it
isn't
on
the
applicability
of
stone
against
powell.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
that
even
be
harmless
beyond
reasonable
doubt
because
you've
been
proven
guilty
at
a
fair
trial?
i
don't
see
how
you're
ever
going
to
have
any
error
under
your
rationale.
maybe
that's
right,
but
it
seems
to
me
we
just
eliminate
the
review
of
grand
jury
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
then
that
grand
jury
could
never
be
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
validly
indicted,
then
his
entire
conviction
must
fall
under
tennessee
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
one
in
federal
habeas
could
say
that
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one
of
those
do
you
read
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
sort
of
non-constitutional
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
stone
against
powell
issue
is
a
--
if
stone
against
powell
bars
any
review
here
we
never
reached
our
constitutional
issue
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kurtz
before
you
get
to
that,
would
you
tell
me
what
period
of
time
your
evidence
covered
with
respect
to
no
black
ever
serving
as
foremen
on
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
continuously?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
the
record
show?
aren't
there
gaps
in
that
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
three
testified
he
didn't
know
at
all.
so
you
are
down
to
two.
