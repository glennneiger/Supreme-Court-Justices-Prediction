are
the
grand
juries
statutorily
regulated
as
to
size
that
they
all
theoretically
are
13?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
as
understood
your
position
to
be
with
respect
to
singling
out
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury,
that
not
necessarily
just
under
federal
habeas
but
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
in
this
particular
case
where
the
foreman
does
invoke
the
general
rule
applying
in
the
presumption
of
prima
facie
case
that
grand
jury
shouldn't
apply
just
because
of
this
particular
foreman.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kurtz
i
am
little
bit
concerned
about
the
same
point
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
raised
with
you
earlier
about
the
actual
existence
of
a
prima
facie
case.
as
i
understand
the
magistrate
to
whom
the
district
court
referred
this
matter
decided
that
you
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case.
the
district
court
then
without
opinion
denied
relief
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court.
now
what
standard
does
the
court
of
appeals
review
that
sort
of
a,
is
that
a
clearly
erroneous
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
send
it
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
it
simply,
it
said
the
habeas
writ
issue,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
state
ever
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut
if
the
prima
facie
case
even
if
the
district
court
had
agreed
with
the
magistrate
that
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
said
the
district
court
said,
gave
the
state
an
opportunity
to
respond?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
the
grand
jury
foreman
signed
the
indictment,
the
indictment
need
be
returned
by
only
12
of
the
13
grand
jurors?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
the
foreman
were
the
13th
and
he
disagreed
with
the
action
of
that
12th,
he
would
nonetheless
be
require
to
sign
it,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
read
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinions
for
the
court
in
elkins
against
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
came
out
a
number
of
years
ago.
i
think
it
spoke
quite
substantially
about
judicial
integrity
in
connection
with
the
fourth
amendment.
