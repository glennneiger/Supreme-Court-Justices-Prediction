chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
rose
against
mitchell.
mr.
leech
you
may
--
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
judges
of
that
court,
what's
the
history
there,
any
negroes
ever
been
judges
of
that
court?
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
no
personal
collection
either
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
point
i
take
it
is
that
whatever
maybe
the
law
with
respect
to
the
membership
of,
the
voting
members
of
the
grand
jury
that
has
no
bearing
on
the
selection
of
the
foreman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
isn't
the
petit
jury
that
determines
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
doesn't
that
wash
out
any
possible
error
in
selection
of
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
that
turned
out
that
there
are
only
ten
grand
jurors
and
the
tennessee
law
requires
12,
then
maybe
there
wouldn't
be
any
indictment,
that's
possible
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
a
matter
of
state
law
is
it
not
essentially?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
kurtz
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
we're
in
that
area
and
since
i
take
it
you
are
a
practitioner
in
that
area,
do
you
know
as
an
officer
the
court
whether
any
judge
of
that
court
has
--
since
1900
let
us
say.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
you
had
a
case,
this
is
hypothetical
now,
where
since
tennessee
was
admitted
to
the
union,
the
records
show
that
the
judge
of
this
courts
that
we
are
dealing
with
had
always
been
a
white
male.
would
you
be
making
the
same
arguments
you
make
here
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not,
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
people
--
the
electorate
can
be
biased
and
discriminatory,
as
well
as
individualist,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
shouldn't
stop
you.
we
have
never
decided
what
the
sixth
circuit
decided
here
either.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
we
often
explore
with
hypothetical
questions
the
reach
of
an
argument
that's
presumptuous.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
process
of
the
petit
jury
that
tries
criminal
case,
who
does
the
selecting
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
--
what's
the
mechanics
of
actually
bringing
40,
or
50,
or
a
100
people
in
at
a
given
time
--
does
it
require
a
commissioner
or
jury
commissioner
or
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
a
member
of
the
grand
jury,
any
member
of
the
grand
jury,
any
member
of
the
grand
jury
can
call
any
witness
he
or
she
wants
to
call?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
implied
in
your
statement
that
the
foreman
dictated
what
witnesses
were
going
to
be
heard
and
that's
not
so
at,
all
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
satisfied
with
what's
presented
to
them
but
that's
one
thing
but
is
not
the
prosecuting
attorney
some
factor
in
what
witnesses
are
going
to
be
presented
to
a
grand
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
the
dominant
factor,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
tennessee
is
different
from
all
the
other
states
of
the
union.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
--
you
said
in
response
to
question
from
mr.
justice
stewart
early
that
indictment
can
be
only
12
votes
of
a
grand
jury
and
not
by
information
as
in
some
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
tennessee
law
allowed
a
charge
to
be
instituted
in
--
even
on
a
homicide
case
by
information
from
the
prosecutor
and
it
appeared
the
prosecutors
for
--
ever
since
tennessee
had
been
member
of
the
union
had
been
white
males
appointed
by
the
governor
since
you
don't
want
to
get
into
the
election
process,
by
appointed
by
the
governor.
your
arguments
would
be
same,
if
the
uncharged
had
been
instituted
by
that
particular
prosecutor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
first
you
try
out
the
prosecutor
before
you
can
try
the
defendant.
as
here
you
want
to
try
out
the
grand
jury
before
you
try
the
defendant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
