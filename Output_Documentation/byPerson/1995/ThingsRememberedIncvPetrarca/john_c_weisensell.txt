mr.
john
c.
weisensell
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
should
affirm,
consistent
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
in
rice
and
thermtron,
that
the
sixth
circuit
holding...
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
sixth
circuit
holding
that
the
sixth
circuit
has
no
jurisdiction
under
1447(d)
and
also
under
1452(b)
to
review
the
district
court
order.
initially,
i'd
like
to
address
some
of
the
comments
that
mr.
cundra
made
and
some
of
the
questions
that
were
posed
by
some
of
the
justices.
justice
ginsburg
accurately
pointed
out
in
asking
mr.
cundra
questions
that
1447
does
preclude
the
relief
sought
here.
there's
nothing
anywhere
in
any
of
the
legislative
history,
and
i
believe
that
justice
o'connor
touched
on
this
also,
to
indicate
that
when
1452
was
enacted,
that
there
was
any
intention
on
congress'
part
to
change
the
provisions
in
1447
that
provide
for
remand
of
cases
on
a
jurisdictional
basis
or
bases
in
a
defect
in
the
removal
procedure.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
anywhere
an
intention
to
change
that,
and
this
court
has
held
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
it
will
not
repeal
legislation
simply
by
implication,
whereas
the
petitioner
argues
here
that
since
1452
does
not
talk
about
a
remand
on
a
jurisdictional
basis,
that
certainly
that's
not
intended
by
1452.
justice
kennedy
also--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--i
believe
1447
does
apply
in
that
case,
your
honor,
depending
upon
the
basis
of
the
remand
order.
if
it's
a
jurisdictional
remand
or
a
remand
based
upon
a
defect
in
the
removal
procedure
itself,
i
think
1447
applies
and
that
case
ought
to
be
remanded
and
there
is
no
review
of
that
order.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
i
think...
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
1447
covers
all
jurisdictional
remands
and
all
remands
on
a
defect
in
the
procedure
of
the
removal.
i
think
that
1452(b)--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--correct,
your
honor,
and
that's--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--and
that's...
but
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
this
is
a
state
court--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
1447
does
talk
about
removal
of
cases.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
civil
action.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
and
any
case
removed
from
a
state
court,
the
district
court
may
issue
all
necessary
orders,
et
cetera.
getting
back
to
the
question,
justice
kennedy,
1452
i
believe
only
provides
for
an
additional
basis
for
remand
in
bankruptcy
cases.
there's...
again,
i'll
get
back
to
the
point
i
made
earlier.
there's
no
indication,
no
intention
that
that
was
going
to
change
the
1447
remands
and
the
fact
that
those
types
of
orders
are
not
reviewable,
and
in
this
case,
this
case
was
not
removed...
excuse
me,
was
not
remanded
on
a
basis
that
is
provided
for
under
1452.
the
petitioner
wants
this
court
to
take
a
strict
constructionist
view
of
that
statute,
and...
but
they
skip
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute.
they
want
the
court
to
jump
right
to
the
second
sentence
of
1452(b),
which
provides
that
in
order
entered
under
this
subsection
remanding
a
claim
or
cause
of
action
or
a
decision
to
not
remand
is
not
reviewable
by
appeal
or
otherwise.
well,
in
order
to
get
to
that
point,
you
need
to
look
back
to
what
are
they
talking
about
under
this
section,
the
court
to
which
such
claim
or
cause
of
action
is
removed
may
remand
such
claim
or
cause
of
action
on
any
equitable
ground.
that
provides
for
an
additional
basis
for
remand
in
bankruptcy
cases,
and
this
case
was
clearly
not
remanded
on
an
equitable
ground,
so
you
don't
get
to
the
second
sentence
of
that
section.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
i
think--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--i
think
under
that
situation,
your
honor,
you
need
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
that
has
developed
since
1887
where
this...
and
then
interpretations
of
this
court
of
remand
orders
generally
that
provide
that
those
types
of
orders
are
not
reviewable
for
the
reasons
of
judicial
economy
and
the
fact
that
parties
should
not
be
litigating
over
where
to
litigate.
that's
the
point
that's--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--i
don't
believe
that
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
i
believe
so,
whether
or
not--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--well,
1447
provides
for
remands
on
jurisdictional
bases.
if
it's
on
a
jurisdictional
bases,
i
believe
that
you
are
within
the
statute,
so
you
don't
get
to
that--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--i
think
that
that
may
be
correct,
your
honor,
but
again
in
this
case
this
is
a
removal
from
a
state
court,
and
also
a
remand
to
a
state
court,
and
i
believe
you
do
tie
back
into
1447
on
that
basis
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
although
the
petitioner
does
point
out
an
example
in
their
brief,
frankly,
in
my
10
years
of
practice
i
have
never
seen
a
case
that
has
been
removed
from
another
federal
court
to
a
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
i...
particularly
the
1452
sections,
subsection
(a)
and
subsection
(b)
of
1452,
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
again,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
had
the
whole
legislative
history
of
1447
and
what
led
up
to
that
and
the
act
of
1887
and
100
years
of
the
statute
and
the
history
behind
that
and
the
interpretations
of
this
court
before
it
when
it
enacted
the
bankruptcy
reform
act
of
1978,
which
put
in
place
i
believe
it
was
1478
at
that
time,
which
became
1452,
and
i
believe
that's
the
reason
why
there
is
no
further
delineation.
the
congress
could
certainly
have
said
in
1452
that
it
expressly
intended
that
these
particular
orders
would
be
the
only
kinds
of
orders
that
there
would
not
be
a
review
of,
and
it
didn't
say
that,
and
that
gets
back
to
my
point
earlier
that
this
court
has
held
on
occasions
that
it
will
not
repeal
legislation
by
implication.
where
there's
a
statute
that
does
not
specifically
repeal
a
prior
code
section,
this
court
is
not
going
to
do
that
as
well.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
well,
i
believe
the
code
sections
say,
your
honor,
that
in
order...
remanding
or
deciding
not
to
remand
is
not
reviewable
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
by
appeal
or
otherwise.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
i'd
say
the
answer's
yes.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
well--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--i
believe
in
the
situation
that
your
honor
just
indicated
i
think
the
answer's
yes,
that
is
not
reviewable,
although
as
mr.
cundra
indicated,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
itself
could
be
reviewed
if
the
case
is
retained
by
the
federal
court
at
the
end
of--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--that
litigation.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
correct.
correct,
but
i
believe
if
the
case
is
remanded
our
position,
and
it's
supported
by
the
statutes,
is
that
it
is
not
reviewable.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
correct,
and
that's
the
intention
of
the
statute,
is
to
get
on
with
the
litigation,
and
that's
the
whole
point
of
why
we're
here.
i
think
this
is
an
important...
the
bankruptcy
reform
act
was
intended
to
be
a
fair
and
credible
statute,
and
to
operate
quickly
and
efficiently,
and
to
have
these
disputes
resolved.
now
we're
here,
3-1/2
years,
going
on
4
years
after
this
simple
state
court
breach
of
contract
action
was
filed
in
summit
county,
ohio.
we're
here
coming
up
on
4
years
on
this
case,
and
we
haven't
litigated
anything
other
than
the
question
of
where
this
case
ought
to
be
litigated.
now,
the
petitioner
had
indicated
in
its
reply
brief
that
that's
because
we
didn't
do
anything
to
prosecute
that
case
in
the
interim.
that
is
not...
not
necessarily
correct,
your
honor,
because
we
did
attempt
to
have...
and
this
ties
in
with
the
question
that
i
believe
justice
kennedy
had
earlier
of
whether
or
not
in
this
case
was
there
a
claim
removed,
or
was
the
entire
case
removed,
and
i
believe
mr.
cundra
indicated
that
the
entire
case
was
removed,
which
is
also
why
you
get
back
to
1447.
but
we
have
attempted
to
litigate
this
case.
we
filed
a
motion
in
the
state
court
to
have
a
status
conference
set
and
get
a
trial
date,
and
the
petitioner's
response
there
was
that
the
trial
court
had
absolutely
no
jurisdiction
over
that
case
because
the
entire
case
had
been
removed
and
was
now
pending
before
the
united
states
supreme
court.
so
we
have
attempted
to
litigate
those
issues,
and
we've
been
estopped
from
doing
that
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court
because
the
entire
case
has
been
removed,
which
answers
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
claim
or
a
case
that
was
removed.
the
entire
case
was
removed.
it
was
removed
from
a
state
court,
and
it
was
remanded
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
i
think
that
ties
you
directly
back
in
to
1447,
and
the
order
is
not
reviewable,
on
appeal
or
otherwise,
by
the
sixth
circuit
or
even
by
this
court.
mr.
cundra
indicated
that
somehow
there
was
a
defect
in
the
remand
procedure
because
the
order...
or,
excuse
me,
the
motion
to
remand
was
filed
sometime
in
november
of
1992.
it's
correct,
as
he
indicates,
that
there
were
two
separate
removals.
one
was
a
removal
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
one
was
another
removal
to
the
district
court.
those
were
ultimately
consolidated.
there
were
two
separate
remand
motions
filed.
one
was
filed
on
october
23
of
1992,
and
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
2a,
it
gives
you
the
chronology
of
those
events.
that's
well
within
the
30
days
provided
for
the
time
to
file
the
remand
motion.
those
cases
were
then
consolidated,
and
judge
white
of
the
bankruptcy
court
addressed
that
issue
and
found
that
the
motion
had
been
timely
filed.
at
any
rate,
this
argument,
similar
to
other
arguments,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
were
not
preserved
because
the
petitioner
did
not
complain
about
the
results
that
came
out
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
they
were
satisfied
with
the
fact
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
was
going
to
ship
the
case
off
to
new
york,
so
when
we
filed
our
appeal,
they
didn't
appeal
any
of
those
rulings.
and
i
would
analogize
this
to,
let's
say,
a
personal
injury
case
where
a
plaintiff
files
a
personal
injury
action
and
gets
a
plaintiffs'
verdict,
but
for
an
amount
that
maybe
that
person
is
not
necessarily
satisfied
with,
or
the
defendant
files
a
notice
of
appeal
on
the
liability
issue.
the
plaintiff
cannot
sit
back
and
go
through
that
whole
procedure
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
come
to
this
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
argue
at
oral
argument
that
they
want
to
have
the
case...
have
an
additional
amount
of
judgment,
that
they're
appealing
the
amount
of
the
verdict
that
was
rendered
in
their
favor.
in
this
case,
they've
waived
their
right
to
raise
a
number
of
these
arguments
that
they're
raising
now.
there
was
a
question
posed
as
to
whether
or
not
thermtron
in
the
bankruptcy
context
reaches
the
correct
result,
that
being
that
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
if
the
case
is...
if,
for
example,
the
bankruptcy
judge
says
that
my
docket
is
too
crowded
and
i
want
to
remand
this,
petitioner's
position
is
that
under
1452,
that
that's
the
correct
result.
well,
that
just
doesn't
make
sense.
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
history
behind
this
court
and
this
court's
decisions
on
the
basis
for
remand.
the
bankruptcy
court
itself
did
rule
on
the
motion
to
remand.
mr.
cundra
indicated
that
the
bankruptcy
court
did
not
do
that.
the
bankruptcy
court
found
that
the
removal
was
not
timely.
the
bankruptcy
court
also
found,
as
i
believe
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
that
the
general
removal
was
timely,
and
again,
that
ties
back
into
our
argument
that
we're
here
on
the
1447
question,
not
on
the
1452
question.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
yes.
1452
is
supplemental.
it
provides
an
additional
basis
for
remand
in
bankruptcy
cases.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
correct.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
justice
scalia
asked
mr.
cundra
a
question
concerning
how
to
read
the
1447
statute,
and
i
think
that
that
was
an
astute
question,
your
honor,
because
even
though
they're
asking
this
court
for
a
strict
constructionist
view
of
the
statute,
in
their
brief
they
in
fact
insert
the
language
that
you
suggested
that
would
need
to
be
inserted
into
1447
in
order
to
reach
the
result
that
petitioner
wants
to
reach.
at
page
26,
they
say
that
the
language
of
1447(b)
actually
reads
as
follows:
an
order
remanding
a
case,
and
then
they
have
in
parenthetical,
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
the
state
court
from
which
it
was
removed,
by
filing
of
a
notice
of
removal...
again,
that's
in
parentheticals...
pursuant
to
section
1446(a)
is
not
reviewable
on
appeal
or
otherwise.
although
they're
asking
this
court
to
strictly
construe
the
statutes,
and
particularly
1452,
they
want
to
insert
language
into
1447.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
i
don't
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
well--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--that's
correct.
if
there
is
a
basis
that
is
not
provided
in
any
statute
anywhere--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--which,
again,
i
don't
believe
is
this
case,
because
i
think
you...
that
this
is
properly
not
reviewable
under
1447.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
in
the
thermtron
case.
the
petitioner's
argument,
and
one
of
the
justices,
and
i
don't
recall
which
one,
indicated
that
if
you
accept
their
argument
there
is
no
mechanism
to
remand
cases
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
a
1452
removal,
that's
correct,
and
that
is
the
basis
why
1447
then
applies
in
those
cases.
1452
creates
an
additional
basis,
but
you
still
have
1447
in
the
jurisdictional
cases.
otherwise,
in
a
1452
case
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
the
court's
stuck
with
the
case,
and
they
can't
remand
it.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
i
suppose--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--i
suppose
it
would,
but
there
have
been
decisions
from
this
court
that
have
held
in
that
situation
that
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
simply
dismiss
the
case
at
that
point.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
well--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
okay.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
i
think
that's
correct--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--but
i
think
i...
unfortunately
i
think
i
also
need
to
concede
that
there
still
is
a
hole
in
the
statute
for
cases
that
are
not
removed
from
state
court.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
if
you
construed
it
that
way,
certainly,
and
one
of
our
arguments
is
also
that
1452
includes
jurisdiction
within
it.
i
was
responding
to
points
that--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--mr.
cundra
made,
and
i
haven't
really
had
a
chance
to--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--get
into
my
portion
of
it,
but--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
and
that
is--
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
--and
that
relates
back
to
the
legislative
history
behind
1452,
where
they
talk
about
such
things
in
that
legislative
history
as
jurisdiction
by
ambush,
and
it's
not
equitable
for
a
party
to
be
subject
to
jurisdiction
in
some
distant
bankruptcy
court
when
all
they
have
is
a
simple
state
court
action
that
they're
entitled
to
have
and
have
a
right
to
have
litigated
in
the
state
forum
of
their
choice,
which
is
precisely
our
case
here.
we
filed
a
simple
state
court
breach
of
contract
action
in
summit
county
common
pleas
court
3-1/2
years
ago,
going
on
4,
it's
been
removed,
their
attempt
to
have
it
removed
to
some
distant
bankruptcy
court
in
new
york.
it's
precisely
the
type
of
situation
that's
covered
by
the
legislative
history
of
1452,
which
uses
terms
like
equity
and
jurisdiction,
to
me
it
appears
as
interchangeably
in
that
legislative
history,
and
that's
why
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
of
1452
intended
to
include
that
within
the
word
equitable,
i
believe
the
layman's
term
use
of
the
word
equitable
as
opposed
to
what
you
or
i
or
other
lawyers
might
mean
by
that
term
when
they
use
that
term
in
another
context.
mr.
john
c.
weisensell
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
a
slightly
different
interpretation,
but
it
serves
the
purpose,
and
i
would
agree
with
your
analysis
that
you
can
plug
that
in,
and
in
fact
a
portion
of
the
legislative
history
does
indicate,
and
i'm
citing
to
the
house
report
and
senate
report
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
reform
act.
and
i'm
on
page
51
thereof,
where
it
indicates
presumably
an
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court
refusing
to
accept
jurisdiction
and
in
effect
remanding
the
matter
to
another
court
would
not
be
appealable
in
the
same
manner
that
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
remanding
a
case
to
the
state
court
from
which
it
was
removed
is
not
reviewable,
on
appeal
or
otherwise.
and
then
they
footnote
there
as
authority
for
that
28
u.s.c.
1447(d),
and
also
this
court's
decisions
in
a
number
of
cases,
including
the
thermtron
case,
so
congress
was
aware
of
the
1447
scheme
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
1447,
and
i
think
your
analysis
can
also
be
used
to
plug
that
in
as
a
1452.
just
one
other
point,
your
honors.
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
there
are
a
number
of
other
special
removal
statutes,
and
we
cited
a
couple
of
cases
under
the
federal
drivers
act,
and
also
under
the
financial
institutions
reform
recovery
and
enforcement
act,
and
those
cases,
in
those
statutes
there
are
specific
removal
and
remand
provisions
that
are
set
up.
and
those
cases
also
indicate,
although
they
are
not
decisions
of
this
court,
they
are
decisions
from
other
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
that
in
enacting
those
statutes,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
set
aside
1447
and
in
fact
1447
does
apply
to
those
other
statutes
that
also
have
very
specific
remand...
removal
and
remand
procedures.
i
cite
the
court
to
that
authority
which
again
is
not
from
this
court,
it's
from
other
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
but
as
authority
for
the
congressional
intent
not
to
repeal
by
implication
1447
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
1452.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'm
concluded.
