mr.
steven
d.
cundra
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
before
the
court
today
concerns
whether
an
order
of
a
district
court
remanding
a
case
on
jurisdictional
or
other
than
equitable
grounds,
a
case
which
had
been
removed
pursuant
to
federal
bankruptcy
court
jurisdiction,
may
be
reviewed
for
error
in
the
circuit
court.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
the
bankruptcy
removal
statute,
1452
of
title
28,
which
prohibits
review
in
the
circuit
court
of
equitable
remands
does
not
apply
to
the
remand
in
this
case,
as
it
was
on
jurisdictional
or
other
than
equitable
grounds,
and
that
the
general
removal
statute,
1447,
has
no
application
in
the
bankruptcy
removal
context.
since
neither
bar
to
review
is
applicable
to
the
remand
in
this
case,
which
was
premised
on
a
demonstrably
erroneous
holding
that
the
removal
was
simply
untimely,
petitioner
things
remembered
should
be
permitted
to
appeal
this
remand
and
to
seek
the
correction
of
that
holding.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
the
statute
that
would
grant
the
right
of
review
would
be
158(d),
i
believe,
of
title
28,
which
grants
review
from
final
orders
or
decisions
of
the
district
court
sitting
as
an
appellate
court
over
bankruptcy
matters.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
i
think
it
is
a
final
order
in
the
context
of
this
court's
holding
in
the
cohen
case,
that
it
is
a...
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
it
finally
determines
a
disputed
issue
between
the
parties,
it's
an
important
issue
that
doesn't
go
to
the
merits
of
the
controversy,
and
would
be
unreviewable
on
appeal.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
yes,
justice.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
yes,
justice.
i
believe
there
are
other
cases
which
address
that
issue
as
well.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
one
has
to
consider
the
context.
the
context
is
the
bankruptcy
reform
act
of
1978.
prior
to
1978,
this
country's
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
was
extremely
limited.
the
only
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
was
that
referees
in
bankruptcy
who
had
the
jurisdiction,
which
was
called
summary
jurisdiction,
which
was
only
property
in
the
actual
or
constructive
possession
of
the
court.
there
was
also
plenary
jurisdiction,
but
it
was
only
by
consent.
in
1978,
congress
determined
that
the
bankruptcy
act
was
not
being
effectively
administered...
chapter
11
cases,
what
are
now
chapter
11
cases
were
not
being
effectively
administered,
and
it
passed
a
brand
new
statute
with
a
very
broad
jurisdiction
over
all
cases
arising
in,
arising
under,
or
related
to
a
bankruptcy
case.
and
congress
determined
that
in
order
to
be
effective
it
had
to
grab
all
litigation
in
whatever
court,
federal,
state,
or
tribal,
and
bring
it
into
one
central
forum
so
that
the
bankruptcy
court
could
adjudicate
the
estate
of
the
debtor
and
adjudicate
in
a
fair
manner
consistent
with
the
interests
of
all
creditors,
not
just
the
two
private
litigants,
and
it
created
the
central
forum.
it
created
a
new
court
which
ultimately
the
delegation
of
power
was
so
great
to
an
article
i
court
this
court
struck
down
that
statute,
or
had
it
amended
in
the
northern
pipeline
and
marathon
decision.
but
that's
what
justified
the
broad
jurisdiction
to
get
all
matters
before
one
court.
it
justified
the
removal
statute,
which
is
unlike
any
other
removal
statute,
reaching
into
any
court,
even
a
federal
court,
to
bring
a
case
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
but
recognizing
there
may
be
inequities
in
that
even
though
it
was
to
prevent
delay
of
bankruptcy
cases,
it
provided
a
broad
remand
power
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
which
would
not
be
reviewable,
and
that
remand
power
that
was
not
reviewable
was
not
only
for
decisions
to
remand
but
also
for
decisions
not
to
remand,
a
bar
to
appellate
review
in
that
context
that
does
not
appear
in
the
general
removal
context,
1447.
a
decision
not
to
remand
is
reviewable
under
1447.
a
decision
not
to
remand
under
1452
is
not
reviewable,
because
it's
a
discretionary
decision.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
under
1447
a
decision
not
to
remand--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--a
decision
not
to
remand
would
not
be
a
collateral
order,
it
would
be
reviewable
at
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
not
immediately
reviewable.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
for
instance.
that's
one
of
the
issues
here.
respondent
would
have
this
court
read
jurisdiction
into
1452(b),
bar
of
appellate
review,
and
if
you
did
that,
or
reinterpret
equitable
to
mean
jurisdictional,
that
means
that
a
district
court's
decision
not
to
remand,
a
district
court's
decision
to
assume
jurisdiction
where
it
has
no
jurisdiction,
would
not
be
reviewable.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
in
a
case
of
a
removal
under
1452--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--that
would
be
governed
by
bankruptcy
rule
9027--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--which
sets
forth
the
time
limits...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
and
the
time
limits
that
are
set
forth
in
9027
can
be
enlarged
by
the
bankruptcy
court
under
bankruptcy
rule
9006,
and
it's
to
treat
any
remand
motion
as
a
contested
proceeding
under
9014.
it
can
determine
what
the
nature
of
the
relationship
is
to
that
estate,
how
important
it
is
to
have
that
case
in
order
to
efficiently
adjudicate
that
debtor's
estate
to
determine
whether
that
entity
is
going
to
be
reorganized,
or
it's
going
to
be
liquidated,
whether
a
major
business
enterprise
will
be
liquidated
or
reorganized.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
in
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--in
the
bankruptcy
context,
if
it
has
not
been
properly
removed
under
1452(a)
from
a
federal
or
state
court,
then
it...
the
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
and
would
have
to
return
it
or
dismiss
it.
the
procedure
in
the
bankruptcy
context
of
how
you
accomplish
that
is
provided
by
9027(d),
which
is
a
motion
to
remand,
to
return
the
case
to
the
jurisdiction
from
which
it
came
in
the
first
place
if
there
was
no
authority
to
remove
it
in
the
first
place.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
one
should
not,
because
they
were
separate
statutory
schemes
which
are
both
comprehensive
in
their
own
domain,
and
exclusive
within
their
own
domain.
they
cannot
be
treated
together.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
in
the
statute,
it
doesn't
use
the
word
remand.
the
bankruptcy
rule
that's
applicable
to
1452,
proved
by
this
court,
does,
and
it
provides
in
9027(d)
that
would
be
by
a
remand
motion
under
9014
of
the
bankruptcy
rules.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
even
if
you
imported
1447
into
1452--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--if
you
were
to
do
that
in
this
case,
it
would
not
change
the
result
that
there
is
no
basis
to
bar
review
of
this
remand
order,
because
1447
requires
the...
to
be
nonreviewable,
the
remand
order...
mot...
order,
rather,
has
to
comply
with
1447(c),
and
when
it
comes
to
procedural
defects,
you
have
to
make
a
motion
to
remand
within
30
days,
or
you
waive
any
objection
to
an
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
in
this
case--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--state,
federal,
and
tribal--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
it
was,
but
1447,
even
if
it
applied,
would
not
provide
a
basis
for
barring
appellate
review,
because
the
case
here
that
was
removed
to
the
bankruptcy
court
was
removed
on
september
25.
the
remand
motion
wasn't
filed
until
november
25.
that's
60
days
later,
and
the
only
bar
to
appellate
review
that's
authorized
under
1447(d)
and
this
court's
holding
in
thermtron
is
a
remand
motion
made
in
compliance
with
1447(c).
a
motion
on
procedural
defects
60
days
after
removal
is
not
in
compliance.
therefore,
there
would
not
be
a
bar--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--under
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
i
believe
it
doesn't
make
sense
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
you
have
to
relate
it
to
what
the
basis
of
the
enactment
is,
which
is
this
broad
expansion
of
jurisdiction
in
the
bankruptcy
courts
with
the
corresponding
remand,
and
with
jurisdiction
not
being
defined,
not
delineated
by
congress...
very
broad,
related
to
the
case,
but
not
delineated,
left
to
the
courts
to
flesh
out
that
jurisdiction.
now,
that
jurisdiction,
because
bankruptcy
courts
before
only
had
summary
jurisdiction,
had
no
in
personam
jurisdiction,
now
that
jurisdiction
of
related-to
means
all
of
this
litigation
we
are
going
to
be
removing
from
state
or
federal
courts
that
were
never
removable
under
bankruptcy
before,
never.
and
how
should
we
delineate
that
related-to
jurisdiction?
congress
didn't
delineate
it.
it
left
it
to
the
courts
to
delineate
it,
and
since
it's
only
being
delineated
or
defined
by
the
courts
in
removal
cases,
we
needed
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
review
that
and
establish
a
nationwide
understanding
of
what
this
new
jurisdiction
is
that
never
existed
in
our
history
before.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
yes.
the
context,
though,
is
an
expansion
in
jurisdiction,
not
an
expansion
in
removal.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
correct.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
the
new
jurisdiction
was
so
broad--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--and
that
you
could
remove
cases
from
any
court
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
a
power
never
before
possessed.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
the
two
schemes
operate
separately
and
independently
of
each
other.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
yes.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
yes.
in
this
case,
the
bankruptcy
court
in
new
york
never
got
to
hear
this
case
and
make
those
decisions.
the
only
bankruptcy
court
that
had
an
opportunity
to
review
this
case
was
the
ohio
bankruptcy
court,
and
it
found
it
had
jurisdiction,
it
ordered
it
transferred
to
new
york,
and
it
said
to
the
home
bankruptcy
court,
so
those
considerations
could
be
evaluated
in
the
context
of
the
debtor's
case.
and
it
did
not
rule
on
the
motion
to
remand.
it
did
not
rule
on
extension.
it
made
no
rulings
in
this
case.
it
deferred
those
to
the
home
bankruptcy
court
who
had
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
but
it
did
find
that
there
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
the
claims
were
specifically
and
exclusively
addressed
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
new
york
bankruptcy
court
in
this
case
entered
an
order
retaining
jurisdiction
of
this
case
when
it
arrived,
which
order
is
still
in
effect.
it
found
jurisdiction
connection
with
its
bankruptcy,
but
it
never
got
there
because
of
the
erroneous
holding
that
a
claim
removed
in
30
days
from
the
time
it's
asserted
is
untimely
because
the
lawsuit
in
which
the
new
claim
had
been
filed
had
been
pending
for
some
period
of
time.
and
that's
one
of
the
great
distinctions
between
the
bankruptcy
removal,
which
is
a
claim
removal
statute,
a
cause
of
action
removal
statute.
it
does
not
remove
the
case.
it's
the
only
removal
statute
that
is
only
claim-specific.
the
general
removal
statute
is
case-general.
you
remove
the
civil
action.
bankruptcy
removal
jurisdiction
is
only
a
claim
removal.
you
could
have
a
20-count
complaint
and
remove
only
one
count,
the
count
that
related
to
the
bankruptcy,
and
that's--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--the
power
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
is
much
greater.
if
they
have
a
question
about
jurisdiction,
all
they
have
to
do
is
remand
for
an
equitable
ground.
if
they
feel
they
have
clear
jurisdiction,
but--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--the
court...
bankruptcy
court
can
simply
by
determining
it's
not
going
to...
if
it
were
late,
beyond
the
90
days
of
905...
of
the
bankruptcy
removal
versus
the
general
removal,
it
can
either
expand
that
time
or
not
in
its
discretion,
that's
true,
and
that
power
does
not
exist
in
the
general
removal
statute.
also
under
bankruptcy
removal,
the
respondent
here
can
wait
a
year
before
he
makes
his
motion
to
remand,
and
the
court
can
still
decide
it.
but
under
the
general
removal
statute,
that
has
to
be
made
in
30
days
or
is
waived,
and
the
judge
has
no
power
to
raise
it
sua
sponte,
a
procedural
defect.
it's
statutory,
1446(c),
and
if
one
were
to
apply
that
in
this
case,
then
that
bar
of
review
for
procedural
defects
does
not
apply
to
this
case
because
the
motion
in
the
bankruptcy
court
was
filed
60
days
later.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
there
is
a...
under
1447
an
immediate
appeal
if
the
motion
was
filed
more
than
30
days
after
removal,
and
then
the
court
remands.
there
is
no
bar
to
a
review
of
that
decision.
it's
only
a
motion
made
within
30
days
on
those
grounds
that
would
not
be
subject
to
appellate
review.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
yes.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
1446(c),
which
describes
the
two
remand
motions
that
are
the
subject
of
1447(d),
which
this
court
held
in
thermtron
must
be
read
in
pari
materia,
that
it's
a
narrow
bar
to
appellate
review,
and
it's
limited
by
what's
in
1446(c),
and
what's
in
1446(c)
as
to
procedural
defects
is
a
motion
made
in
30
days
on
that
grounds--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--perhaps
respondent
better
address
that
in
his
argument.
but
one
of
the
problems
that
that
creates--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--the
court
evaluated
it
under
both
removal
schemes.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
the
district
court
remanded--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--i
think
the
court
remanded
it
under
both
removals.
there
was
a
dual
removal
here
to
two
different
courts.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
correct.
i
believe
that's--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--the
second
sentence
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
finding
of
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
here.
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
words
of
the
district
court
was
the
untimely...
in
the
court's
view,
an
untimely
removal,
even
though
it
was
within
30
days
of
when
the
claims
were
asserted
in
the
action.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
under
the
general
removal,
yes.
under
the
general
removal,
the
jurisprudence
that's
developed
is
that
any
defect
of
that
nature
is
waived
unless
a
motion
is
filed
within
30
days,
and
that
a
court
cannot
sua
sponte
dismiss
it
on
the
basis
of
a
failure
to
meet
the
time.
it's
mandatory,
but
not
jurisdictional,
is
the
jurisprudence
that
has
developed.
with
respect
to
how
you
interpret
(c),
or
(d),
rather,
to
limit
it
to
the
precise
matters
that
are
in
(c),
justice
scalia,
is
the
holding
in
thermtron
that
the
two
can't
be
read
in
pari
materia,
and
that
the
only
remands
which
can
evade
appellate
review
are
ones
that
are
precisely
within
the
four
corners
of
1446(c).
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
the
bankruptcy
court
found
the
removal
was
timely.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
the
only
order
that
the
bankruptcy
court
entered
was
an
order
transferring
venue
to
have
the
remand
decision
handled
by
another
court.
the
remand
decision
was
not
determined
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
it
was
reserved
for
the
home
bankruptcy
court
to
make
the
decision.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
yes.
with
respect
to
the
amended
complaint,
the
new
claims
to
$12
million
that
were
asserted
arising
out
of
the
conduct
of
child
world
in
the
bankruptcy
case
leaves
rejection
damages
under
502
of
the
code.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
civil
action,
removal
of
the
civil
action.
you
can't
remove
a
claim
under
1441
to
1447.
you
either
remove
the
whole
action
or
you
don't.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
then
you
would...
yes.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
yes.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
there
was
a
dual
removal.
one
was
of
the
civil
action
under
1441,
which
went
to
the
district--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--court,
and
then
a
separate
removal
that
was
done
under
the
bankruptcy,
which
went
to
the
bankruptcy
court
in
akron.
they
were
consolidated
later,
but
at
the
time
relevant
here
in
terms
of
the
timeliness,
they
were
in
separate
courts
under
different
removal
schemes.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
if
there
is
no
basis
of
federal
or
diversity
jurisdiction
on
those
other
claims,
correct.
1441--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--only,
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg,
if
those
other
claims
are
separate
and
independent,
and
not
in
any
way
related
or
pendent
to
the
claim
upon
which
you're
removing
federal
jurisdiction,
and
i
think
that's
in
1441,
and
it
provides
for
remand
of
the
separate
and
independent
claims
for
which
there
is
no--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--or
to
remand--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--right,
which
are
remanded.
if
i
have
any
more
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
thank
you.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
two
quick
points.
the
concept
of
reading
jurisdiction
into
1452,
whether
you
consider
it
equitable
to
do
that
or
import
1447
or
not,
cannot...
would
fundamentally
change
the
law
of
jurisdiction
that's
ever
existed
with
respect
to
removal
and
remand,
because
1452
deals
with
the
decisions
not
to
remand
as
well,
so
retention
of
jurisdiction
under
1452
would
be
forever
unreviewable
by
any
court.
1447--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
it
says
a
decision
not
to
remand
under
1452
never
be
reviewed
by
appeal
or
otherwise
at
any
time.
that's
an
absolute
bar.
it's
not
just
a--
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
--yes.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
that
would
be
the
result,
because
that's
the
only
statute
that
makes
unreviewable
a
decision
not
to
remand.
there
are
decisions
to
remand
that
are
unreviewable,
but
that's
the
only
one
that
makes
a
decision
not
to
remand
unreviewable.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
one
would
hope.
mr.
steven
d.
cundra
which
then,
reading
it
in
would
make
it
unconstitutional,
the
statute
to
be
read
as
including
jurisdiction
would
render
it
unconstitutional.
the
two
schemes
do
not
relate
to
each
other.
not
only
do
they
relate
not
on
the
issue
of
remand
or
not
to
remand,
one
is
bankruptcies
of
a
cause
of
action,
1447
is
the
whole
case.
bankruptcies,
any
plaintiff,
any
defendant,
any
other
party,
and
the
second
scheme,
general,
is
only
all
defendants--
