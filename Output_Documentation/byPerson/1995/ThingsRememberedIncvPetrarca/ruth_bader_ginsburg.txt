justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
you
have...
you're
relying
on
the
third
circuit
pacor
case
for
that
preliminary...
for
how
you
characterize
this
as
a
cohen
v.
beneficial--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
you
explain
to
me
what
sense
it
would
make
to
say
that,
in
general,
removal
is
not
reviewable
at
all,
then
we
know
congress
wanted
to
take
into
account
a
different...
to
make
the
remand
larger
rather
than
smaller,
and
then
to
say...
and
for
that
larger,
no
review
but
for
what
was
always
understood
never
to
be
reviewable,
suddenly
in
the
bankruptcy
context
it's
reviewable?
what
possible
sense
does
that
reading
make?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
judge
in
this
case
said,
i'm
not
100
percent
sure
about
strict
time
limit,
but
i
think
you
should
have
come
here
sooner,
so
for
equitable
reasons
i'm
remanding
this
because
i
think
you
dawdled...
an
equitable
notion
like
laches,
no
fixed...
that
would
not
be
reviewable,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
the
judge's
label,
what
he
wants
to
put
on
it.
he
can
make
it
immune
from
review
if
he
says,
laches.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
reviewable
if
he
says,
time
bar
under
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
confused
by
your
answer.
i
thought
under
the
general
removal
remand
scheme
a
remand
order
is
not
reviewable,
period.
are
you
telling
me
that
there
is
something
in
the
1441
to
1447
regime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
sometimes
this
court
has
said,
and
a
rigid
time
bar
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional,
so
do
you
think
that
those
expression
are
wrong
when
they
type
a
rigid
time
bar,
no
give,
no
good
cause
for
extension,
as
mandatory
and
jurisdictional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
it
not
true
that
under
the
general
removal
scheme
you
can
end
up
with
a
claim
rather
than
a
case?
that
is,
under
1441(c),
while
the
case
is
initially
removed,
the
court
can
return
claims
within
that
case
and
keep
only
the
separate
and
independent
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
court
would
have
the
option
to
keep
the
entire
case.
it
doesn't
have
to.
it
can
peel
off
the
pieces
that
would
not
be
independently
reviewable,
and
you
end
up
under
1441(c)
with
essentially
a
claim,
not
a
case,
removed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
provides
for
a
retention
of
the
separate
and
independent
claim--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
return
of
the
others.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
frequent
are
removals
from...
of
the
federal
district
court,
that's
even
strange
language,
because
every
other
place
where
there
is
transportation
within
the
federal
system
it's
called
transfer
and
not
removal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ever.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ever.
you
couldn't
do
it
at
the
end
of
the
trail,
either.
they're
just
simply
not
reviewable,
remand
decisions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
you
remand
a
case
to
state
court,
you
couldn't
at
the
end
of
the
line
come
back
and
argue
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court,
well,
there
was
a
misconstruction
of
the
remand
statute
so
we
should
not
have
had
to
suffer
the
state
court
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
if
it's
retained--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
always
reviewable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
once
you
remand
it
to
the
state
court,
that's
it.
that
question
is
not
going
to
come
up
to
a
federal
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
your
view
on
1452
to
be
it's
essentially
supplemental,
it
applies
to
the
extent
that
it
applies,
and
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
hole,
you
still
have
the
basic
removal
remand
scheme?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
was
something
more
than
just
not
provided
for.
it
was
an
off-the-wall
category,
the
mandamus.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
does
it
have
to
be
the
layman's
approach?
you
are
giving
alternative
arguments.
one
is
that
1452
is
an
add-on.
it
doesn't
displace
1441
to
1447.
the
other
is,
it
is
self-contained,
but
a
judge
in
deciding
what
is
equitable,
what
is
appropriate,
can
say
the
closest
thing
that
i
have
is
the
scheme
of
1441
to
1447,
so
i
will
plug
that
into
the
word
equitable.
it
is
equitable,
appropriate,
to
remand
on
any
ground
that
a
court
would
have
remanded
under
in
14...
under
the
1441
to
1447
regime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it
was
really
a
case
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
constitution
would
trump
any
such
statute,
right,
because
article
iii
says
what
congress
can
tell
the
federal
court
they
can
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
always
reviewable
because
of
the
limitation
on...
the
constitutional
limitation
on
the
court's
authority.
