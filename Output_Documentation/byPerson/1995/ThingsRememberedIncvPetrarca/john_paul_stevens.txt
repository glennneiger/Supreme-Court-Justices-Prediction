mr.
cundra,
are
you
ready?
we'll
now
hear
argument
in
number
94-1530,
things
remembered
v.
petrarca.
mr.
cundra.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question?
the
briefs
mainly
argue
about
whether
either
statute
prohibits
review.
would
you
explain
to
me
what
statute
grants
you
the
right
to
review,
and
in
what
language?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
this
a
final
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
theory
is
it's
a
collateral
order
under
cohen?
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
just
there?
in...
forgetting
bankruptcy
for
a
moment,
a
decision
not
to
remand
is
reviewable
in
the
ordinary
case,
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
prohibited,
but
is
that
a
collateral
order,
a
decision
not
to
remand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
not
immediately
reviewable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
also
your
point
that
that
statute
justifies
remands
to
state
court,
whereas
the
bankruptcy
statute
applies
to
remands
to
both
state
and
federal
courts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
interrupt?
is
it
not
true
that
in
view
of
the
larger
docket
in
the
bankruptcy
courts
they
also
gave
additional
grounds
for
removal
on
any
equitable
ground,
which
presumably
might
have
been
intended
to
pick
up
the
problem
in
the
thermtron
case
that
if
the
docket
is
heavy
in
that
court,
they
think
the
case
might
be
disposed
of
more
promptly
in
the
court
it
was
originally
filed,
therefore
they
have
power
to
remove.
to
remand,
i
mean.
when
you
expand
the
remand
power
there,
doesn't
it
seem
somewhat
inconsistent
to
say
they
would...
and
they
said
no
review
of
those,
so
wouldn't
it
be
more
consistent
with
the
overall
approach
you
describe
to
give
the
bankruptcy
courts
greater
control
over
their
docket
by
letting
them
have
final
authority
on
whether
or
not
to
remand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
accompanied
by
an
expansion
of
the
power
to
remand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
grounds
that
would
not
be
available
in
a
nonbankruptcy
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
not
agree
that
if
they
did
remand...
say
this
is...
a
bankruptcy
court
had
a
case,
a
carbon
copy
of
thermtron,
and
they
decided
to
remand
it,
which
they
could
because
of
their
crowded
docket.
that
remand
would
not
be
reviewable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
weisensell,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
use
the
term
civil
action
in
1446--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
it
is
entire
cases,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
alternative
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cundra,
you
have
about
2
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cundra,
i
think
we
have
your
position.
your
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
