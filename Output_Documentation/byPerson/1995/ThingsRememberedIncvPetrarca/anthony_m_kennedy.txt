justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
theory,
if
an
action
within
1452
is
removed
but
the
removal
is
untimely,
its
motion
is
made
too
late
under
1446,
what
authority
does
the
court
have
to
remand
the
case
back
to
the
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
untimely.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
you've
answered
my
question
in
such
detail
that
i
couldn't
quite
follow
it,
but
my
question
is,
what
is
the
authority
of
the
court
to
remand
a
case
that
is
untimely
removed,
under
your
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
you
say
1447,
then
we
say
that
your
argument
fails,
so
i
have
to
know
what
your
theory
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your
view,
you
cannot
refer
to
1447
for
any
case
that's
removed
under
1452,
or
am
i
misstating
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
much
so
that
there
is
no
express
provision
for
remand
of
untimely
removed
cases
under
1452.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
was
it
clear
that
a
claim
was
removed
but
not
the
entire
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
position
is
that
if
a
claim
is
removed,
then
1447
can't
apply,
because
1447
talks
about
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
your
answer
would
be
no.
that
was
my
question.
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
dual
removal.
a
dual--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
position
is
that
the
two
statutes
cover
the
entire
universe
of
possible
remand
orders.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
it
applies
both
as
an
additional
basis
for
removal
and...
no,
an
additional
basis
for
remand.
that's
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
they're
relying
on
thermtron,
i
guess,
for
doing
that,
aren't
they?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
thermtron
made
it...
said
that
you
don't
read
1447(d)
as
broadly
as
the
plain
language
suggests,
because--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
is
a
category
of
removals
that
is
reviewable
by
mandamus.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
you
have
to
accept
that
result
if
the
removal
was
from
a
federal
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
removal
was
from
a
federal
court
rather
than
a
state
court,
would
not
that
anomaly
exist,
that
there
would
be
no
statutory
basis
for
remand--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
remove?
