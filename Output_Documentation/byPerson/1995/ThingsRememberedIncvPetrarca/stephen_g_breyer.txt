justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
i
don't
know
about
the
facts
of
this
case.
that
is
to
say,
i
thought
we
took
this
case
in
order
to
review
the
relationship
of
the
statutes,
not
whether
some
time
thing
was
complied
with
or
not,
but
i
guess
we'd
have
to
remand
it
on
that
point.
i
haven't
thought
through
that
point.
but
in
terms
of
the
statutes,
doesn't
it
make
what
justice
o'connor
just
said,
perfect
sense?
i
mean,
you
have
two
statutes.
1447
deals
with
jurisdictional
defects
and
with
defects
in
the
removal
procedure,
and
it
says
there,
we're
not
going
to
review
those.
then
in
the
bankruptcy
area,
quite
often
there
are
other
bases
for
remanding.
the
other
bases
are,
you
say
to
the
judge,
do
what
you
think
is
right.
so
they
do
it
on
equitable
grounds,
and
that's
covered
by
52,
and
52
says
you
can't
review
the
ones
under
us,
and
47
says
you
can't
review
the
technical
things
under
us,
and
it
all
seems
to
make
sense.
now,
i'm
putting
that
to
you
so
you
can
explain
why
it
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say...
i'm
sorry.
it
doesn't
say
on
that
ground.
i
mean,
i
take
it
what
their
answer
to
this
point
is
going
to
be
is
you
in
fact
did...
i
can't
remember
which...
i
get
mixed
up
here,
but
whoever
wanted
it
remand,
made
a
motion
to
remand,
all
right,
and
they
made
it
under
52,
and
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
says,
i
don't
think
i
can
do
it
under
52,
but
i
can
do
it
under
47,
so
he
remands
it
under
47,
and
certainly
he
has
the
authority
to
go
on
some
other
statute,
even
if
the
motion
that
was
before
him
mentioned
the
wrong
statute,
and
i
would
think
that
is
what
they're
going
to
say
cures
the
problem
of
the
30
days,
if
i
have
it
right.
you
can
tell
me
i
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that
would
strike
me
as
a
big
problem
with
this
30-day
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
remanded
it.
the
lower
court
remanded
it
under
47.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
district
court
remanded
it
under
47,
and
what
you
want
to
do
is
appeal
that
remand
under
47,
and
now
you
want
to
say
that's
not
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under...
what
i
have
from
their
brief
is,
it
says
the
bankruptcy
court
held
that
tri
had
timely
removed
the
case
under
the
general
removal
statute,
namely
47.
now,
is
that
accurate,
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
did
not,
it
says,
appeal
any
aspect
of
that
ruling,
is
that
accurate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
it's
thermtron,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
anything
that's
not...
i
mean,
in
a
nonbankruptcy
case,
outside
the
jurisdictional
and
defect
in
removal
proceeding
area,
thermtron,
and
so
the
answer
would
be
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
there
a
hole
in
the
statute?
i'm
just
testing
my
own
understanding
of
it,
but
forget
bankruptcy.
outside
the
bankruptcy
area
there
are
all
kinds
of
cases
where
people
remove
cases,
and
then
they
ask
for
remand,
and
there
is
the
case
where
you're
remanding
on
a
jurisdictional
ground,
or
a
defect
in
removal
proceeding
ground,
and
there
may
be
other
grounds,
i
don't
know.
there
could
be
a
million
grounds,
and
the
ones...
the
jurisdictional
or
removal
defect
are
covered
by
47,
and
the
others
are
covered
by
thermtron.
is
that
right?
i'm
asking
because
i'm
trying
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
would
simply
be
governed
by
thermtron,
because
anything
not
covered
under
the
statute...
i
mean,
i
can
call
it
a
hole
or
not
a
hole,
i
just--
--and
thermtron
is
not
a
statute.
no,
that's
right.
that's
right.
and
he's
conceding
that
thermtron
is
not
a
statute.
but
it's
not
un...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
unusual
it
is.
well,
there
would
be
no
hole
in
the
statute
if
you
construed
the
word
equitable
to
read
appropriate.
then
there
would
be
no
hole
in
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
but
the
obvious...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
that
means
that
when
it's
part
of
the
final
judgment
you
wouldn't
look
to
see
if
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
normally,
the
"or
otherwise"
is
because
you
often
review
on
mandamus.
it
really
means
you
never
could
even
look
to
jurisdiction.
