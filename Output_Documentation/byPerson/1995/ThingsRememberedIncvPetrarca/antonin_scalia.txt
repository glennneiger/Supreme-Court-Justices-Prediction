justice
antonin
scalia
and
your...
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
your
argument
about
the
30-day
thing.
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
it
is
that
you
cannot
use
the
second
sentence
of
1447
in
a
case
where
you
can't
use
the
first
sentence,
that
1447(c)
comes
all
of
a
piece,
and
you
can't
use
the
remand
authority
of
1447(c)
in
a
case
where
the
30-day
time
limit
is
not
applicable.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
nothing
in
the
text
that
really
says
that.
i
mean,
if
the
second
sentence
had
begun,
if
at
any
time
before
final
judgment
in
a
case
properly
brought
within
said
30-day
period,
comma,
then
you'd
have
a
good
point,
but
it
really
doesn't
mention
the
30
days
in
the
second
sentence.
i
mean,
what
your
opponent's
going
to
say
is,
we're
not
relying
on
the
first
sentence
of
(c).
we're
just
relying
on
the
second
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
you
removed
all
the
claims
in
the
case?
haven't
you
removed
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
all
the
claims
in
this
case
been
removed?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
a
major
limitation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
in
response
to
justice
kennedy
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
there's
a
big
hole.
1447
only
covers
remand
to
state
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
whole
of
the
universe
is
not
covered.
of...
and
it
talks
only
about
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
with
a
remand
that
is
not
on
an
equitable
ground
as
you
interpret
what
equitable
ground
means...
it's
on
a
jurisdictional
ground...
but
the
remand
is
not
to
a
state
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
that
governed
by?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
not
covered
by
this
statute,
however.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
will
acknowledge
that
this
is
not
a
tightly
drawn
statutory
scheme.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
assert
that
we
have
inherent
authority
to
preclude
not
just
immediate
review,
but
to
preclude
all
review
of
the
decision
to
remand
in
cases
that
fall
between
these
two
statutes.
that
is,
where
the
remand
is
not
to
a
state
court
and
therefore
not
covered
by
1447,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
remand
is
not
for
equitable
reasons.
you
say
that
in
that
situation,
we
have
inherent
authority
simply
to
decline
review.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
that
we
might
have
some
authority
to
say
we
won't
review
it
right
away.
we
won't
allow
an
interlocutory
review.
but
to
say,
we
won't
review
it
at
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be,
but
i
mean,
whatever
other
good
arguments
you
might
have,
one
of
your
good
ones
is
not,
my
opponent's
position
leaves
a
big
hole
that
isn't
covered
by
either
of
the
provisions,
because
your
solution
leaves
a
big
hole
that
isn't
covered
by
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
the
provisions
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say,
well,
we're
just
going
to
have
to
fumble
around
and
do
our
best
with
that,
and
i
suppose
your
opponent
says
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
let's
call
the
hole-in-the-statute
argument
a
draw.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
even
mentions
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
explicitly.
