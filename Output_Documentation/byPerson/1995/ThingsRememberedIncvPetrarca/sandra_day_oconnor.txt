well,
mr.
cundra,
generally
we
don't
find
any
kind
of
repeal
by
implication
of
another
statute
because
a
new
one's
adopted,
and
it's
unclear
to
me
why
you
think
that
section
1447
does
not
remain
available
to
a
district
court
even
though
there
may
be
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
i
mean,
the
district
court
remanded
in
this
case
because
of
a
procedural
defect,
and
i
don't
see
why
1447
wasn't
available
to
the
court
to
rely
upon
to
get
that
defect
corrected.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
import
it.
just
say,
it's
still
on
the
books,
it's
available
to
the
court,
and
that's
what
the
court
can
look
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right--
--yes,
but
this
was
a
remand
to
a
state
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
don't
have
some
of
these
other
potential
problems
here.
this
was
a
remand
to
a
state
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
if
that's
so,
i
would
think
that
your
normal
interpretation
of
statutes
would
lead
you
to
conclude
that
the
court
should
retain
the
power
that
it
has
under
1447
to
remand
cases
or
to
remove
them.
i
mean,
i
just
don't
see
why
under
your
theory
we
should
be
so
restrictive
of
the
power
of
these
bankruptcy
courts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
may
be
other
grounds,
such
as
the
one
in
this
case,
that
isn't
equitable,
and
why
shouldn't
they
have
the
power
to
send
it
back?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
whether
or
not
it
was
timely
is
a
question
dealt
with
by
the
courts
below,
and
we
don't
have
to
address
that.
i
mean,
that's
something
that
on
review
at
the
end
of
the
case
can
be
addressed,
but
under
1447,
there's
no
immediate
appeal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
just
a
state
court,
so
that
brings
us
back.
suppose
it's
to
some
other
state
agency
or
some
other
court.
