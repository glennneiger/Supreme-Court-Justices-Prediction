justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
one
point,
is
it
clear
that
those
channels
are
offered
pursuant
to
this
section
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
we're
looking
at,
when
the
locality
imposes
those
conditions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
the
part
of
subsection
(h)
that
precedes
section
10
which
was
in
the
statute
all
along.
it
says,
any
cable
service
offered
pursuant
to
this
section.
does
what
you
described
fit
within
that
language?
i
want
to
be
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
these
restrictions
you
describe
were
imposed
by
the
locality
rather
than
the
federal
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you.
supposing
congress,
not
in
a
formal
finding
but
committee
reports
and
lots
of
testimony,
everybody
says,
well,
we're
pretty
sure
that
a
lot
of
parents
are
guilty
of
inertia.
they
don't
pay
enough
attention
to
this
problem,
as
they
should.
all
that
was
perfectly
clear
that
that's
what
congress
thought.
would
the
outcome
of
the
case
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
that's
something
we
could
take
judicial
notice
of?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
just
ask
one
question?
i
understand
generally
how
it
works
when
most
of
the
channel
is
a
certain
kind
of
programming,
but
supposing
you
have
a
channel
that
normally
is
athletics,
or
something
very
normal,
but
they
occasionally
put
on
a
medical
program
or
some
unusual
program
that
would
fall
within
the
statutory
definitions.
how
does
it
work
as
a
practical
matter
that...
how
do
they
block
that
and
give
the
people
in
the
audience
a
choice
of
whether
to
see
it
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
some,
you
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
but
there
are
certain
kinds
of
programs
that
would
have
a
public
value
that
would
nevertheless
fall
within
the
definition
of
indecency,
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
isn't
exactly
indecency,
it's
got
different
words
in
the
statute
to
describe
the
kind
of
program.
justice
john
paul
stevens
live
births,
for
example,
might
be
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand,
but
i'm
asking
you
about
the
program
that's
on
the
borderline.
it
might
be
a
movie
with
certain
scenes
in
it,
or
it
might
be...
but
not
one
that
you
just
say,
obviously
this
should
not
be
seen
by
children.
they're
sort
of
borderline
things,
and
being
cautious
the
operator
would
probably
say,
pursuant
to
our
policy,
we'll
treat
this
as
indecent.
having
done
so,
how
can...
how
does
it
work
that
the...
that
that
one
program,
which
is
different
than
the
normal
run
of
programs
on
that
channel,
becomes
available
to
the
public
or
gives
the
public
a
choice
between
either
getting
it
or
not
getting
it?
how
does
it
work
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
are
you
saying
that
category
doesn't
exist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
he
notifies
that
a
program
that's
going
to
be
shown
at
7:00
to
9:00
tomorrow
night
is
arguably
indecent.
what
happens
after
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
decision
is
made
to
block
the
particular
program,
how
does
the
audience
get
the
opportunity
to
make
a
choice
to
have
it
unblocked?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
much
notice,
and
what's...
how
does
it
work
in
the
individual
case?
i
really
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how
much
notice
does
he
get?
it
shows
up
in
the
weekly
tv
guide,
or
whatever
it
is,
we're
going
to
show
a
certain
movie,
and
they
want
to
see
it.
how
do
they...
everybody
has
to
expect--
justice
stevens
the
chief
justice
is
attending
a
judicial
conference
and
will
not
be
with
us
this
morning.
justice
breyer
has
an
opinion
to
announce.
