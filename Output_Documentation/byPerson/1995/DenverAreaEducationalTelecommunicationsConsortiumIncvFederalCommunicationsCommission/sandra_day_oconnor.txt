mr.
greenberger,
how
does
the
1996
act
affect
this
situation?
it
applies
some
blocking
requirement
now
on
nonaccess
channels,
right,
under
the
new
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
just
explain
to
me
what
change
the
new
law
makes
now
that
applies
across
the
board
to
all
kinds--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
we
have
any
cable
operators
and
programmers
here
arguing
that
their
first
amendment
rights
are
being
protected
by
this
legislation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course,
it's
kind
of
a
curious
arrangement,
because
i
guess
on
a
nonaccess
channel
of
a
cable
operator
the
cable
operator
can
charge
a
premium
for
channels
that
have
indecent
material
on
them,
and
many
do,
don't
they?
they
charge
more.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
earn
more
money
for
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
would
be
a
real
incentive
for
them,
then,
to
think
that
this
is
a
dandy
scheme
because
they
can
keep
it
off
the
nonaccess
channels
and
make
more
money
by
selling
their
own.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
precisely
the
argument
here,
and
there
is
some
indication
that
when
you
look
at
the
whole
scheme
that's
what's
happening,
that
the
thumb
has
been
put
on...
the
government's
thumb
has
been
put
on
the
scale
to
eliminate--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--a
certain
type
of
protected
speech.
