what
does
that
have
to
do
with
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
constitutionality
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
congress,
so
long
as
it
passes
the
words
by
majority
vote,
the
words
can
come
from
nowhere
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
all
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
i'm...
the
findings
have
to
be
in
the
bill,
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
floor
debate?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
only
speaks
through
its
statutes.
it
doesn't
speak
through
the
statement
of
one
senator
in
a
floor
debate.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
so
silly.
but
i
don't
want
to
waste
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
that
a
bill
that
comes
to
the
floor,
which
has
so
clearly
a
compelling
interest
that
it
is
immediately
adopted
by
acclamation,
you're
telling
me
that
bill
is
weaker
than
one
which
is
debated
on
the
floor.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
back
to
whether
there
have
to
be
findings
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
back
to
whether
there
have
to
be
findings
or
simply
evidence
from
which
this
court
could
make
a
reasonable
conclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
has
to
be
a
finding.
i
thought
you
just
said
there
didn't
have
to
be
a
congressional
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
keep
going
back
and
forth
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
congress
doesn't
have
to
make
the
judgment.
we
can
make
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
does
have
to
make
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
those
channels
are
blocked,
i
take
it,
unless
you
pay
the
fee.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
how
the
cable
owner
makes
his
profit
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
blocks
them
unless
you
take
the
affirmative
action
of
paying
a
fee,
and
asking
for
them
to
come
into
your
home.
