mr.
greenberger,
do
i
misunderstand
the
d.c.
circuit's
in
banc
decisions
on
this
point?
as
i
read
them,
i
thought
that
the
conflict
lay
in
the
area
of
the
or
block
question.
that
is,
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
one
of
the
judges
accepted
that
if
all
you
had
was
cable
operator,
you
can
ban,
they
all
would
have
found
the
scheme
constitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
asking
you
to
forget
the
either.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
suppose
they
had
had
(a)
and
(c)
and
no
(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
there
was
not
a
one
of
them
that
said,
if
all
you
had
was
(a)
and
(c),
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
greenberger,
isn't
all
precedent
relevant
to
the
issue
of
harm,
so
that
really
your
concentration
should
be
on
the
means
used
to
check
that
harm?
pacifica,
the
act
cases
in
the
d.c.
circuit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
thinking
it
was
pretty
well
accepted
that
there
is
harm
to
children.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
i
understand
your
point
about
the
cable
operators
up
to
a
point,
and
it's
this,
if
the
statute
were
simply,
you
can
ban
it
if
you
want
to,
that's
your
judgment,
but
the
argument,
as
i
take
it,
on
the
other
side
is,
it
isn't
pre-choice
for
the
operator.
by
putting
this,
or
block
into,
you're
pushing
the
choice.
government
is
steering
the
choice
in
favor
of
ban
rather
than
to
make
available.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it...
the
most
vulnerable
part
of
your
case
is
the
or
block
option,
because
the
argument
is
made,
i
think
loud
and
clear,
that
the
government
isn't
being
a
neutral
arbiter.
it
is
making
it
tough
to
give
the
customer
the
choice,
because
it
says,
if
you
do,
you
have
to
first
block,
and
then
you
have
to
turn
on,
instead
of
saying,
make
it
available,
if
the
customer
doesn't
want
it,
the
customer
will
tell
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
wallace,
before
we
get
into
that,
isolating
it
is
not
what
i'm
asking
you
about.
you
said
the
ban
choice
restores
choice
to
the
cable
operator.
the
suggestion
is
that
it
doesn't
restore
choice,
that
it
is
forcing
a
particular
choice,
that
it's
pushing
in
one
direction,
so
that
(a)
and
(b)
have
to
come
together.
they
can't
be
disassociated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
the
question
i
meant
to
address,
mr.
wallace,
because
i'm
powerfully
confused
by
talking
about
state
action
when
you're
dealing
with
a
statute,
and
a
statute
that
concerns
speech,
so
that
statute
is
subject
to
first
amendment
controls--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i
don't
know
how
state
action
got
into
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
like
to
understand
what
your
position
is
on
the
pushing
the
cable
operator
to
make
one
choice,
that
is
to
ban,
and
also
putting
the
subscriber,
the
customer,
in
the
uncomfortable
position
of
having
to
list
yourself
as
someone
who
wants
to
subscribe
to
indecent
programming.
