justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
you
making
this
point
in
order
to
lead
up
to
your
state
action
argument?
is
that
what
you're
laying
the
groundwork
for?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
there
might
be
state
action
even
if
the
government
had
enacted
this
statute
in
the
very
first
instance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
is
a
tendency
to
require
censorship,
editorialization,
however
you
want
to
characterize
it,
that
is
positive.
and
that
has
to
be,
isn't
it
so,
mr.
wallace,
because
otherwise
congress
would
have
been
acting
for
no
purpose
at
all.
wasn't
it
congress'
purpose
to
diminish,
to
restrict,
to
regulate
what's
called
indecent
programming,
and
your
characterization
of
it
seems
to
indicate
that
congress
acted
for
no
purpose
whatsoever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
it
one
of
the
justifications
for
the
bill
that
is
under
the
law
as
enacted,
it
is
easier
for
the
subscribers,
the
viewers,
to
hold
people
to
account
for
what
they
say,
whereas
without
the
act
it's
not
very
clear
to
whom
we
can
object?
is
that
part
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
this
argument
made
in
the
briefs?
maybe
it
was,
and
i
just...
this
idea
of
accountability,
that
the
act
makes
it
more
clear
who
is
accountable
for
producing
and
broadcasting
this
stuff?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
might
be
better
advised
to
spend
your
time
defending
the
scheme
rather
than
saying
that
it's
not
state
action,
mr.--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
on
a
different--
