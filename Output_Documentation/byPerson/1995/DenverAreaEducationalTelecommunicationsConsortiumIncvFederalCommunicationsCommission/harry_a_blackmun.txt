justice
blackmun
this
is
the
opinion
in
denver
area
educational
telecommunications
versus
fcc.
these
cases,
there
are
two
of
them,
involve
first
amendment
challenges
to
three
sections
of
the
cable
television
consumer
protection
and
competition
act
of
1992.
the
first
section,
section
10(a)
applies
to
leased
access
channels
that
are
about
10-15%
of
the
channels,
say,
on
an
80-channel
system
maybe
12
channels,
federal
law
requires
cable
operators
to
reserve
for
commercial
lease
those
channels
that
can
be
leased
or
happen
to
lease
by
affiliated
party.
the
provision
permits
the
cable
system
operator
to
control
either
to
allow
or
to
prohibit
programming
that
the
operator
reasonably
believes
detect
sexual
activity
or
organs
in
a
patently
offensive
manner.
that
is
the
first
one.
the
second
one,
10(b)
also
applies
only
to
this
leased
access
channel.
it
requires
cable
system
operators
to
segregate
this
patently
offensive
programming
from
all
the
other
programming
that
is
run
on
leased
channels
and
then
to
have
it
broadcast
on
a
single
channel
and
then
have
it
blocked
so
that
viewers
to
get
access
have
to
write
in
up
to
30
days
in
advance.
there
is
a
third
section
and
the
third
section
is
just
like
the
first,
that
it
gives
the
cable
operators
control
over
patently
offensive
material
that
this
is
the
material
that
would
be
run
not
on
leased
access
channels
but
on
what
are
called
public
or
educational
or
governmental
channels
which
is
another
set
of
channels
best
known
as
education.
now,
the
circuit
court
of
appeal
to
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
all
three
of
those
provisions
were
constitutionally
permissible.
in
this
opinion,
and
in
the
holdings
today,
we
say
that
two
of
the
three
provisions
violate
the
first
amendment.
the
third
one
does
not.
now
let
me
begin
with
section
10(a),
that
is
the
one
that
we
hold
is
okay.
it
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
that
is
the
one
that
permitted
the
cable
system
operator
himself
to
control
the
patently
offensive
programming
on
leased
channel.
now
in
an
opinion,
in
which
i
am
joined
by
justice
stevens,
justice
o’connor,
and
justice
souter,
the
four
of
us
find
that
the
provision
has
an
important
indeed
a
compelling
regulatory
objective
namely
protecting
children
from
the
broadcast
of
patently
offensive
sexual
material.
a
broadcast
television
program,
unlike
the
individual
telephone
conversations
that
were
at
issue
in
a
different
case
called
sable
communications,
here
this
broadcast
is
in
pervasive,
it
is
intrusive,
and
children
are
often
in
the
audience.
the
opinion
also
finds
that
the
regulation
is
properly
tailored
to
meet
this
child
protecting
objective.
it
is
permissive,
allowing
operator’s
latitude
to
avoid
harming
children
without
necessarily
banning
the
program,
it
will
apply
to
a
relatively
narrow
category
of
material
which
we
discussed,
and
to
a
degree
it
reflects
a
first
amendment
interest
of
the
cable
operators
themselves
in
return
to
those
cable
operator
a
form
of
editorial
control
that
the
operators
had
enjoyed
in
respect
to
those
channels
10
years
earlier
before
congress
had
taken
that
power
away
from
that.
these
and
other
factors
make
the
first
amendment
balance
complex
with
no
precise
analogy
in
this
court’s
earlier
cases.
nonetheless,
the
opinion
draws
support
from
pacifica,
a
case
involving
the
broadcast
of
offensive
material
to
children
which
case
upheld
the
regulation
that
was
likely
more
or
certainly
no
less
restrictive
that
the
regulation
at
issue
here.
the
court
holds
that
the
second
provision,
section
10(b)
requiring
the
blocking
and
segregating
of
offensive
material.
we
hold
that
that
provision
violates
the
first
amendment.
the
opinion
is
for
the
court
in
this
respect,
in
respect
to
this
provision.
it
finds
the
provision
more
restrictive
that
10(a),
a
viewer
could
not
watch
a
scrambled
program
for
example
without
considerable
perhaps
30
days
advance
planning.
program
as
of
individual
programs
could
not
reach
viewers
who
tending
to
think
that
programs
are
judged
by
the
company
they
keep
just
would
not
want
watch
that
patently
offensive
channel
and
viewers
might
here
being
listed
as
people
who
want
patently
offensive
programming.
we
recognize
that
the
justification,
the
protection
of
children,
is
compelling
but
there
are
obvious
significantly
less
restrictive
alternatives
including
alternatives
more
recently
adapted
in
the
1996
telecommunications
act
which
apply
to
all
and
not
just
leased
channel.
we
also
hold
unconstitutional
the
third
provision.
section
10(c)
which
permits
cable
system
operators
to
allow
or
to
prohibit
patently
offensive
programming
on
public,
educational,
and
governmental
channel.
the
opinion,
with
respect
to
this
provision
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
souter
only
have
joined,
recognizes
that
this
provision
looks
identical
to
the
first
one
applying
to
leased
channel.
but
the
record
reveals
several
critically
important
differences.
cable
operators
have
not
historically
exercised
editorial
control
over
these
channel.
for
reasons
that
we
point
out,
the
first
amendment
risks
were
measured
against
the
regulation’s
ability
to
protect
children
are
far
greater
and
the
need
for
the
provision
is
significantly
less.
we
conclude
that
the
government
has
not
shown
a
patently
offensive
programming
problem
on
these
channels
great
enough
to
justify
the
regulation.
to
repeat,
we
hold
that
section
10(a)
is
constitutional
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
that
provision.
we
hold
that
section
10(b)
and
section
(c)
are
not,
and
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
those
provisions.
the
opinion
speaks
for
the
court
with
respect
to
10(b)
only
not
for
10(a)
or
10(c).

stevens
