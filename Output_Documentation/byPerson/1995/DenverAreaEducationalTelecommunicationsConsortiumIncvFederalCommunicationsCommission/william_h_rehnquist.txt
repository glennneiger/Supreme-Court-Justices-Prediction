first
this

educational
telecommunications
consortium

mr.
greenberger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
this
came,
too,
at
the
instance
of
municipalities--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--rather
than
the
national
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
they
sanctioned
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
just
kind
of
ratified
what
was
in--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
refer
to
the
in
banc
court.
only...
there
were
four
dissenting
judges
below,
and
only
two
of
them
agreed
with
the
proposition
that
there
was
state
action,
so
two
of
the
dissenting
judges
thought
there
was
no
state
action
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
you're
saying
that
the
bill
itself
has
to
make
a
finding
that
there's
a
compelling
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
we've
ever
held
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
have
to
make
factual
findings,
but
you
can
make
factual
findings
in
a
bill
that
originates
on
the
floor.
your
suggestion
in
response
to
justice
scalia
that
there's
something
wrong
with
a
bill
that
originates
on
the
floor--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
think
has
any
foundation
in
our
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
congress
go
about,
in
your
view,
showing
that
it
was
using
the
least
restrictive
means?
would
a
boiler
plate
recital
somewhere
that
we
find
this
to
be
a
least
restrictive
means,
would
that
aid
the
adjudication
of
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
about
what?
are
you
saying
that
the
congress
has
to
make
a
finding
that
what
it's
doing
is
the
least
restrictive
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
telling
me
that
sable
holds
that
congress
has
to
find
that
what
it's
doing
is
"the
least
restrictive
means"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
say
there
must
be
a
record
from
which
this
court
could
make
that
determination
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
congress
has
to
make
the
determination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--including,
in
your
view,
a
finding
that
what
we
are
doing
is
the
least
restrictive
means?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
recall
any
case
in
which
i've
seen,
in
the
20
years
i've
been
on
the
bench,
that
i've
read
a
record
where
congress
has
said
we
find
what
we're
doing
is
the
least
restrictive
means.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
then
what
are
we
coming
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--what
if
the
question
were
whether
violent
crime
is
a
problem
in
the
united
states,
and
there
had
been
no
finding
by
congress.
we
could
not
take
judicial
notice
of
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
well,
if
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
a
fact
like
that,
surely
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
other
facts,
too,
so
long
as
they
meet
the
standard
for
judicial
notice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
your
position
is
that
in
some
cases
the
court
cannot
possibly
make
its
own
finding
but
in
others
it
can.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
right?
am
i--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
greenberger.
mr.
lawrence...
or
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
what's
an
example
of
an
access
channel
in
this
region?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
