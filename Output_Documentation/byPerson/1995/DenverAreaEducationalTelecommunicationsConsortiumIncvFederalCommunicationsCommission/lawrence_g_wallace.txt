mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
whole
point
of
this
court's
remand
in
turner
broadcasting
was
based
on
its
holding
that
cable
operators
do
have
first
amendment
rights
and
further
findings
were
needed
to
see
whether
the
must-carry
provisions
at
issue
in
that
case
were
a
valid
restriction
on
those
first
amendment
rights.
indeed,
point
2
of
the
court's
opinion
in
turner
broadcasting
starts
with
the
following
sentence:
there
can
be
no
disagreement
on
an
initial
premise
cable
programmers
and
cable
operators
engage
in
and
transmit
speech
and
they
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
speech
and
press
provisions
of
the
first
amendment,
so
justice
breyer's
question
is
very
much
in
point
here.
access
programmers
are
a
special
category
of
cable
programmers
first
provided
for
by
congress
in
the
1984
act.
of
course,
some
access
programming
had
originated
theretofore.
the
leased
access
programming,
the
commercial
access
programming,
was
far
less
common,
and
that
is
the
kind
that
congress
required
cable
operators
to
set
aside
channels
to
accommodate.
the
public
access
programs,
the
so-called
peg
access
programming,
public,
educational,
and
governmental,
was
already
quite
common
and
congress
merely
authorized
franchising
authorities
to
continue
that
at
their
discretion.
but
what
congress
did
do
that
was
new
was
to
make
access
programmers
a
special
category
by
providing
that
the
operators,
the
cable
operators
would
have
no
editorial
control,
no
editorial
discretion
with
respect
to
programming
on
those
channels.
they
do
have
that
kind
of
discretion
with
respect
to
other
cable
channels.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
time
warner
in
an
amicus
filing
in
our
support
is
an
example
of
that.
there
are
a
great
many
briefs
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
leased
access
channels
are
one
which
the
cable
operators
also
collect
a
fee
from
the
users
of,
and
that
fee
can
be
adjusted
based
on
how
many
viewers
are
attracted,
what
kind
of
commercial
rates
the
programmer
may
be
able
to
charge,
et
cetera.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct,
and
fee
disputes
can
be
taken
to
the
commission
on
that.
now--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
the
cable
operator.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
far
as
i'm
aware.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
talking
about
viewers,
i'm
talking
about
the
programmers
who
lease
the
access.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
lease
is
a
fee-paying
arrangement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
precisely
so,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i...
what
i
want
to
try
to
clarify
in
leading
up
to
addressing
that
is
what
we
see
as
the
scope
of
governmental
action
involved
here
that
is
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
the
first
amendment,
that
does
have
to
comply
with
the
first
amendment,
and
what
is
in
our
view
not
governmental
action.
sections
10(a)
and
10(c)
of
the
1992
act
readjust
the
distribution
of
editorial
discretion
between
the
operators
and
the
programmers
with
respect
to
indecent
programming.
to
that
extent,
an
act
of
congress
does
constitute
governmental
action,
and
has
to
be
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
in
its
analysis
of
the
case,
any
such
adjustment
by
congress
between
these
two
protected
groups
is
what
could
be
described
as
a
move
in
a
zero
sum
game
for
first
amendment
purposes,
because
any
conferral
of
discretion
on
one
correspondingly
diminishes
the
discretion
that
the
other
one
would
have
over
programming.
there's
still
the
same
total
amount
of
programming
available
to
the
viewing
public.
it's
just
a
question
of
who's
exercising
the
discretion.
so
we
have
suggested
that
if
that...
the
adjustment
is
made,
regardless
of
whether
the
1984
act
came
first
or
the
1982
act
came
first,
if
that
adjustment
is
made
in
a
reasonable
manner
that
is
viewpoint
neutral,
then
it
should
be
upheld,
because
congress
is
not
trying
to
influence
what
people
can
hear
by
dictating
views
that
will
be
made
available.
it's
leaving
it
up
to
actors
in
the
private
sector.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
leaving
it
solely
to
the
option
of
the
operators
whether...
we're
talking
about
10(a)
and
(c)
now,
not
the
blocking
provision
of
10(b),
which
of
course
is
governmental
action.
it's
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
would
have
to
differ
with
that
in...
but
it
will
take
a
moment
to
explain
it.
what
congress
thought
was
in
the
public
interest,
at
least
judging
by
the
provisions
it
enacted,
is
that
because
of
a
consideration
this
court
recognized
in
turner
broadcasting,
it's
to
the
advantage
of
the
public
to
have
a
multiplicity
of
sources
available
to
provide
programming
and
therefore
the
access
programming
itself,
which
has
to
be
from
unaffiliated
sources,
that
the
cable
operator
is
required
to
carry,
is
something
that
serves
the
public
interest.
but
congress
was
also
concerned
that
an
operator,
a
cable
operator
who
is
providing
these
services
should
not
be
required
against
its
will
to
become
a
purveyor
of
indecent
programming
over
its
system.
it
is
the
one
with
the
direct
contact
with
the
consuming
public,
and
providing
the
service
and
selling
the
service,
and
so
congress
thought
that
the
operator
should
have
that
option.
and
our
view
is
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
congress
to
sacrifice
one
of
those
aspects
of
the
public
interest
to
the
other,
that
it
can
allow
this
kind
of
programming
to
be
available
on
access
channels
but
at
the
operator's
discretion
in
order
to
serve
both
aspects
of
what
congress
reasonably
concluded
is
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
particularly
on
the
access
channels,
which
are
typically
not
channels
where
any
one
programmer
is
on
the
whole
time,
but
they're
made
available
in
blocks
of
time
that
people
can
afford
to
buy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
would
have
to
say
the
argument
is
more
implicit
than
explicit--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--when
you
articulate
it
that
way.
[laughter]
but
i
think
that
it
is
inherent
in
our
pointing
out
that
congress
had
a
strong
interest
in
allowing
the
operators
the
discretion
to
decide
whether
they
wanted
to
transmit
programming
of
that
nature
while
still
otherwise
requiring
that
they
transmit
access
programming
from
unaffiliated
sources
without
exercising
editorial
control,
because
there
are
special
problems
connected
with
indecency.
but
i've
been
trying
to
lay
the
groundwork,
then,
to
get
to
the
question
that
justice
ginsburg
put
to
me,
which
is
really
the
argument
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
mean,
what
i've
said
so
far
is
consistent
with
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis,
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
to
address
any
first
amendment
intention
based
upon
just
the
redistribution
of
authority
itself,
and
that's
why
the
court
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
goes
to
the
10(b)
segregation
and
blocking
requirement,
which
we
have
argued
is
not
subject
to
the
strictest
scrutiny,
but
it
can
pass
muster
under
the
strictest
scrutiny
test
because
of
what
justice
souter
quite
aptly
called
the
inertia
problem.
in
ginsberg,
this
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
gets
us
back
to
the
state
action
question
in
the
attack
on
the
conferral
of
discretion
on
the
operator
in
10(a)
and
10(c).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the...
well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
have
explained
that
of
course
the
readjustment
of
discretion
itself
is
governmental
action
that
is
subject
to
first
amendment
restrictions,
but
what
the
argument
below
was
on
10(a)
and
10(c)
is
that
while,
on
the
face
of
it,
the
operator
would
be
the
one
deciding
whether
or
not
to
carry
the
indecent
programming,
that
could
have
been
the
way
the
1984
act
was
written
in
the
first
place.
it
isn't
the
change
in
the
act
that
is
so
crucial
here
to
their
argument.
what
they
are
arguing
is
that
that
choice
is
one
where
other
provisions
of
the
statute
and
the
statutory
scheme
so
weigh
on
the
choice,
the
government's
thumb
is
so
heavily
on
the
scales
encouraging
the
operator
not
to
carry
it,
that
the
private
choice
has
to
be
attributed
to
the
government,
and
is
part
of
what
is
implicit
in
the
enactment.
the
mere
fact
that
congress
has
exercised
its
commerce
power
and
made
rules
to
govern
the
relations
between
private
parties
that
preempt
any
state
law
to
the
contrary
is
not
something
unique
to
this
statute.
it's
true
of
any
exercise
of
the
congress'
power.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
something
that
is
not
a
disclosure
to
the
government,
but
something
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
would
be
a
closer
analogy
to
lamont
v.
the
postmaster
general,
it
would
be
more
of
a
problem
of
possible
stigma,
but
this
is
something
that
the
cable
operator
is
required
to
keep
confidential.
it's
just
a
way
of
ordering
services
that
are
offered,
and
those
services
have
been
ordered
by
large
numbers
of
dial-a-porn
customers
in
new
york
city,
for
example,
as
we've
pointed
out,
and
as
the
second
circuit
found
in
its
dial
decision
on
that,
dial
information
services.
the
arguments
that
are
made
seem
to
us
not
to
satisfy
the
test
that
this
court
has
laid
down.
what...
the
starting
premise
on
this
kind
of
inquiry
about
whether
a
private
action
can
be
attributed
to
the
government
is
that
you
can't
just
start
off
saying
that
the
government
is
required
to
prohibit,
is
required
by
the
first
amendment
to
prohibit
a
private
person
such
as
the
operator
from
refusing
to
carry
it,
because
that
would
really
be
an
indirect
way
of
saying
that
private
conduct
is
itself
subject
to
the
first
amendment
if
the
first
amendment
requires
certain
action
on
the
part
of
the
cable
operator.
so
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
the
government
can
normally
be
held
responsible
for
a
private
decision
only
when
it
has
exercised
coercive
power
or
has
provided
such
significant
encouragement
that
the
choice
must
in
the
law
be
deemed
that
of
the
government
rather
than
the
private
actor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
when
we
look
at
what...
at
the
elements
of
what
are
said
to
be
the
government's
thumb
on
the
scales,
they
seem
to
us
not
to
be
substantial
enough
to
meet
this
court's
test.
it's
true
that
members
of
congress
expressed
the
hope
on
the
floor
that
this
might
be
the
result,
but
that
did
not
impose
any
legal
obligation
or
material
inducement
to
the
operators,
nor
would
it
necessarily
even
come
to
their
attention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
obligation
is
on
the
programmer
rather
than
the
operator
to
notify
the
programmer...
to
notify
the
operator.
the
programmer
has
to
notify
the
operator--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
it's
going
to
be
broadcasting
anything
indecent,
so
there's
no
burden
placed
on
the
operator.
it
can
rely
on
certifications
from
the
programmer
and
any
sanctions
would
fall
on
the
programmer.
there's
no
burden
on
the
operator
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that...
segregate
and
block
it.
for
large
systems
that
ordinarily
scramble
programming,
this
is
not
a
substantial
impediment.
they
have
the
technology
to
do
that
as
they
do
with
their
pay-per-view
or
premium
pay
channels.
for
smaller
systems,
in
the
rulemaking
the
commission
said
that
they
can
use
a
lock
box
system
that
is
centrally
controlled,
so
that
there
has
to
be
a
written
request,
unlock
the
box,
the
code,
and
it's
the
operator
who
will
do
the
unlocking.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
think
a
medical
program--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--has
been
anything
ever
found
indecent
by
the
commission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
depends
on--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
depends
on
what--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--is
meant
by
a
public
value.
a
live
birth
might
very
well
not
be
indecent.
the
examples
that
we
give
in
footnote
25
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
which
i
invite
the
court
to
look
into,
are
examples
of
very
graphic
sexual
activities
that
the
commission
has
found
to
be
indecent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
in
the
first
place,
it's
up
to
the
programmer
to
notify
the
operator
that
a
program--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
it's
indecent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
operator,
if
the
operator
is
not
showing
indecent
programming,
if
it
has
exercised
that
choice,
then
that
program
won't
be
shown.
if
it's
doing
the
segregation
and
blocking--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
would
normally
be
put
into
that.
i
mean,
the
operator
is
usually
not
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
view
the
program
in
advance
and
to
make
a
judgment
about
it.
when
there
are
disputes,
there
are
a
number
of
remedial
provisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
a
subscriber
can
notify
the
operator
in
writing
that
it
wants
access
to
the
indecent
programming,
and
will
be
given
access.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
would
have
had
a
blanket...
a
notice
on
a
blanket
basis
that
indecent
programming
on
the
segregated
channels
would
be
made
available
to
that
subscriber,
and
they
will
get
it
the
way
they
would
get
hbo
if
they're
paying
the
fee
for
hbo,
and
the
channel
would
be
available
to
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
right--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
the
first
place,
the
status
quo
is
not
that
most
consumers
have
a
lock
box.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
that
they
can
get
a
lock
box
if
they
know
of
the
existence
of
it
and
know
that
there's
reason
to
have
one
because
indecent
programming
may
be
coming
in
which
they
may
not
even
be
aware
of.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
you
ask
for
it,
and
most
consumers
do
not
have
a
lock
box.
the
problem
that
the
sponsors
of
this
legislation
found
was
over
the
access
channels,
where
programming
is
very
unpredictable
because
you've
got
different
programmers
on
each
hour
or
half-hour.
you
never
know
what
will
be
coming
over
the
access
channels,
and
that's
where
most
of
the
unwanted,
uninvited
indecency
would
crop
up
that
there
was
concern
about
protecting
children
from.
you're
not
going
to
see
it
over
nbc
or
pbs
and
so
on.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
know
of
an
example
in
this
region.
what...
well,
of
course,
the
peg
channels
are
things
like
the
montgomery
county,
or
one
of
the
university
channels
that
use
them
for
educational
programs,
and
they
have
been
much
less
of
a
problem
of
indecency
taking
viewers
by
surprise
and
suddenly
cropping
up.
the
commercial
access
channel
that's
recounted
in
the
record
in
some
detail
is
channel
35,
the
time
warner
channel
in
new
york
city,
which
has
practically
nonstop
indecent
programming
on
it
put
on
by
a
variety
of
programmers
who
come
on
a
first-come,
first-served
basis.
