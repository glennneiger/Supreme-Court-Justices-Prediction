mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
question
of
constitutional
analysis
of
section
10
of
the
1992
cable
act,
which
in
turn
amended
provisions
of
the
federal
cable
act
of
1984
that
dealt
with
public
and
leased
access
channels
on
cable
systems.
it
is
important
to
note
that
public
and
leased
access
channels
are
not
a
creation
of
the
federal
government.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
turner
broadcasting
case
just
18
months
ago,
cable
companies
owe
their
very
existence
to
municipalities
giving
them
by
contract
the
rights
of
way
in
their
community
to
lay
and
string
their
cable.
that's
encompassed
in
a
franchising
agreement.
as
part
of
that
franchising
agreement,
that
contract
between
the
municipal
government
and
the
cable
company,
it
had
become
a
practice
in
the
sixties,
seventies,
and
eighties
for
municipalities,
without
any
inspiration
from
the
federal
government
or
requirement
by
the
federal
government,
to
insist
as
a
condition
of
allowing
entrance
of
the
cable
companies
and
allowing
them
to
speak
in
the
very
first
instance,
that
they
set
aside
channels
for
the
public,
and
those
channels
were
supposed
to
be
used
and
are
used
on
a
first
come,
first
served,
nondiscriminatory
basis,
free
of
editorial
control
and,
in
fact,
in
the
usual
case--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--in
other
words,
does
section
10
apply
to
these
channels?
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
yes.
it
is
definitely...
i
think
there's
no
dispute
between
the
parties
that
public
and
leased
access
channels
are
covered
by--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--yes.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
as
well
as
insisting
upon
leased
public
access
channels,
as
we
noted
in
our
reply
brief,
by
1982
over
350
jurisdictions,
municipalities,
had
insisted
that
leased
channels
be
set
aside.
those
are
channels
which
can
be
used
by
people
who
are
interested
in
doing
commercial
television
and
can't
get
their
programming
on
a
regular
cable
channel.
in
1984--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--yes.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
that's
correct.
there
was
a
general
feeling
and
a
fear
on
the
part
of
municipalities
when
they
opened
their
city
for
the
laying
and
stringing
of
cable
that
they
were
allowing
a
kind
of
monopoly,
or
at
least
a
bottleneck,
into
their
community
with
regard
to
the
speech
over
the
cable
system,
and
they
wanted
to
let
people
unaffiliated
with
the
cable
company...
that
is,
the
public
in
general
and
people
who
wanted
to
use
leased
access...
to
come
on
and
be
able
to
use
that
free
of
editorial
control
by
the
cable
operator.
in
fact,
with
regard
to
public
access,
most
nonprofit
public
access
corporations
are
appointed
by
the
municipal
government
itself.
they're
the
ones
who
are
responsible
for
it.
in
1984,
when
congress
first
got
involved
in
regulating
cable,
they
looked
at
this
process,
made
extensive
studies,
had
findings
in
the
legislation
that
this
was
a
good
thing,
they
sanctioned...
they
did
not
require,
but
they
sanctioned
the
practice
of
municipalities
having
public
access
channels,
and
they
did
require
that
they
be
free
from
editorial
control,
but
that
was
already
a
condition
in
the
franchising
agreements
themselves.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
they
said
that
communities
may
have
public
access
programming.
they
did
not
say,
we
require
it.
they
did
not
say
you
have
to
have
it.
they
didn't
say
how
you
had
to
have
it.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
they
ratified
what
the
cities
had
already
done.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
yes,
i
am
leading
up
to
that
point,
because--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
will
address
that
point,
but
the
one
thing
i
want
to
make
clear
is
that
in
banc
court
of
appeals
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief
refuses
to
acknowledge
what
is
clear
from
the
record
and
nobody
disputes,
is
the
prior
history
of
there
being
no
editorial
control
by
cable
companies
over
public
and
leased
access.
the
cities
didn't
want
it.
they
wanted
their
citizens
to
be
able
to
get
on
free
of
editorial
control.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
right,
and
the
fundamental
mistake
i
think
that
the
nine
judges
made
who
didn't
agree
with
us
below
is
they
refused
to
recognize...
the
in
banc
said
the
1984
act
took
away
editorial
control
in
the
first
instance,
it
was
required
by
the
federal
government,
and
all
the
1992
act
did
was
restore
editorial
control.
the
only
persons
who
challenged
that
were
the
two
dissenting
judges
who
dissented
across
the
board.
now,
our
position
is
the
1992
act,
which
is
a
floor
amendment
without
hearings,
without
studies,
without
reports,
without
house
consideration,
and
handled
in
a
matter
of
minutes
on
the
floor--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--it
certainly--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--justice
scalia,
when
congress
acts
against
the
prohibition
of
the
first
amendment
that
congress
shall
make
no
law,
if
it's
a
content-based
discrimination,
which
we
argue
this
is,
there
must
be
a
compelling
interest
and
the
least
restrictive
means.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
now,
this
court
said
in
sable,
and
the
plurality
repeated
again
in
turner,
that
it's
not
an
agency
proceeding
but
there
must
be
some
record
somewhere,
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
bill
itself...
congress
often
makes
findings
in
bills
as
they
did
in
the
'84
act...
that
there
is
a
compelling
interest--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--what
i'm
saying--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
this
court
has
been
flexible
and
said
both
in
sable,
which
is
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court,
and
in
the
plurality
in
turner,
that
congress
can
do
this
any
way
it
wants,
but
when
it
treads
on
the
rights
of
the
first
amendment
it
has
an
obligation
to
let
this
court
know
some
way
whether
there's
a
compelling
interest
and
whether
the
least
restrictive
means--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--no.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
didn't
understand
that
was
the...
i
agree
with
you
completely
that
the
findings
can
be
in
the
bill
on
the
floor
and,
of
course,
in
this
legislation,
there
were
no
such
findings.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
they
can
be
anywhere.
in--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--in
sable...
i
know
that
you
had
a
separate
opinion
in
sable,
justice
scalia,
but
in
sable
eight
justices
of
this
court
said
somewhere
in
the
floor
debate,
in
the
hearings,
in
the
bill,
somewhere,
this
court
has
to
be
told
that
congress
has
a
compelling
interest.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
that
is--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--if
that's
the
prevailing
view,
justice
scalia,
that
it
can
only--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--the
minority
is
protected
not
by
acclamation
votes
but
by
an
explanation
that
there's
a
compelling
interest,
and
this
court
has
insisted
that
the
congress,
when
it
act
pursuant
to
the
first
amendment,
if
it
has
a
content-based
statute,
which
this
statute
is,
that
it
outline...
not
posit
a
disease,
as
justice
kennedy
said
in
the
turner
broadcasting
case,
they
have
to
show
that
there's
real
harm,
and
they
have
to
show,
if
it's
content-based
discrimination,
that
the
least
restrictive
means
are
used.
in
this
case,
section
10(a)
and
10(c)
provide
the
cable
operator,
the
very
persons
that
the
municipalities
didn't
want
to
get
involved
in
this
situation,
that
they
have
the
discretion
to
ban,
to
impose
a
total
ban
on--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
sable
case,
justice
white
said
that
they
could
go
about
it
in
any
way
they
want
to,
but
they
have
to--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--it
doesn't
have
to
make
a
finding,
but
it
somehow
has
to
allow
this
court,
when
it
makes
a
review,
and
this
court
has
frequently
said
it
has
independent
judgment
over
what
congress
does,
not
de
novo
review
in
this
area,
but
an
independent
judgment.
it
has
to
tell
this
court
why
they're
making
a
law
that's
abridging
freedom
of
speech,
and
if
it's
content-based
discrimination,
what
they
have
to
tell
this
court
is
that
there's
a
real
harm,
a
compelling
interest,
and
that
the
least
restrictive
means
are
being
used,
and
sable
so
holds.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
i...
sable
does,
and
sable
follows
many
precedents,
mr.
chief
justice.
sable
says
there
must
be
a
record,
and--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--no,
it's...
the
cases
make
it
very
clear
that
it's
congress
that's
abridging
the
speech,
and
congress
must
make
the
record--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--and
this
court
reviews
the
record.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
i--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--your
honor,
they
may
not
have
to
say
it
with
those
exact
words.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
but
they
have
to
say...
for
example,
in
sable,
which
dealt
with
dial-a-porn,
which
is,
we
believe,
basically
a
much
more
serious
indecent
problem
than
we're
dealing
with
here,
but
in
sable
the
court
said
there
they
had
an
existing
means
to
regulate
the
problem...
credit
cards,
access
codes...
and
justice
white,
speaking
for
substantial
members
of
this
court,
said
that
in
order
to
put
a
total
ban
in
effect,
which
is
what
sable
did,
congress
must
somewhere
explain
to
this
court
in
a
meaningful
way
why
the
existing
regulation
is
no
longer
the
least
restrictive
means.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
no,
i
don't
feel
the
same
way,
and
i
will
give
you
three
reasons
i
believe
that
the
first
amendment
rights
here
of
the
so-called
cable
companies
are
at
least
accommodated,
if
they
exist
at
all.
in
the
first--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--as
i
mentioned
originally,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
turner,
to
be
able
to
speak
in
the
first
instance,
cable
companies
had
to
come
to
municipalities
and
say,
we
want
to
get
on
your
property,
we
want
to
lay
and
string
cable,
before
they
had
any
rights
to
speak.
and
the
municipalities
universally...
and
congress
recognized
this
in
1984...
universally
said,
fine,
but
you've
got
to
set
aside
space
for
us,
public,
unaffected...
it's
just
like
a
subdivision.
you've
got
to
set
aside
parks
for
the
public.
they
said,
you've
got
to
set
aside
some
of
your
channels.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
well,
the
first
amendment
rights--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
the
first
amendment
rights
are
being
dealt
with
in
a
completely
different
case
that's
like
the
must-carry
case
that
this
court
handled
in
turner.
so
far,
the
united
states
government
has
taken
the
position
that
if
the
cable
operators
have
any
rights
with
regard
to
public
access
and
leased
access,
the
discrimination
against
them
is
content
neutral
because
there's
no
content
involved,
it's
first-come,
first-served,
and
the
district
court
has
so
held.
the
united
states,
when
it
gets
up
here,
has
to
tell
you
that
it
is
arguing
these
cable
operators
don't
have
the
rights
on
leased
access.
in
the
turner
case,
we
had
a
much
harder
question.
in
the
turner
case
it
was,
does
nbc
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
be
carried,
and
the
congress
said
in
that
case,
and
made
a
record,
a
detailed
record,
well,
the
local
nbc
station
does,
because
we
want
to
have
local
content.
now,
most
of
this
court
said
that
was
content-neutral.
some
of
this
court
said
it
was
content-specific
because
it
required
a
local
nature.
in
this
case,
all
the
municipalities
said
was,
first-come,
first-served,
we
don't
care
what
you
say,
and
cable
operator,
stay
out
of
their
way.
so
if
they
have
first
amendment
rights,
if
they
didn't
surrender
it
upon
entering
into
the
cable
business
by
getting
the
municipality
to
let
them
come
on
the
property,
those
rights
have
been
fully
accommodated.
the
united
states
is
so
arguing,
judge
jackson
so
held
in
the
daniels
case,
that
case
is
on
appeal,
and
twe,
time
warner
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--with
regard
to
the
leased
access,
the
cable
company
either
must
ban,
which
is
a
total
ban
for
adults
and
children--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--all
right.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
if
it's...
we
think
there
are
three
things
the
in
banc
court
did
not
deal
with
when
it
decided
this
decision,
three
decisions
of
this
court,
the
turner
case,
the
sable
case,
and
the
skinner
case.
the
turner
case--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--judge
wald
and
judge
tatel
did
agree
that
(a)
and
(c)
were
unconstitutional
in
and
of
themselves,
and
judge
edwards
and
judge
rogers
said
that
(a)
and
(b)
were
unconstitutional
because
they
work
together,
must
block
or...
must
ban
or
block.
but
leave
(b)
to
the
side.
let's
talk
about
(a)
and
(c).
(a)
and
(c)
set
up
content
discrimination.
everybody
who
wants
to
speak
can
get
onto
public
access
or
leased
access
if
they
pay
a
fee
except
those
people
who
have
to
identify
themselves
as
speaking
"indecently"
as
that
is
broadly
defined
in
these
definitions.
so
you
have
people
who
have
a
right
to
get
on,
most
people,
but
if
you
self-label
yourself
indecent,
if
you
self-censor,
you
can't
get
on.
in
our
view--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--you
can...
well,
that
goes
to
our
least
restrictive
means
argument,
but
for
nonaccess
channels
what
they've
said,
is
if
you've
got
indecent
stuff
and
you
don't
want
it
in,
call
up
the
cable
operator
and
tell
them
to
scramble
it.
cable
operator,
you've
got
to
scramble
it.
here
they
say,
for
public
and
leased
access,
what
we're
going
to
do
is
allow,
against
the
municipalities'
wishes...
and
by
the
way,
there
are
no
municipalities
involved
in
this
case,
saying
they're
coming
apart
because
of
the
problems
in
public
and
leased
access,
but
against
the
municipalities'
wishes
they
say,
you
can
totally
ban,
for
adults,
too.
if
under
(a)
you
totally
ban
leased
access,
adults
don't
see
it,
at
all.
in
pacifica,
at
least,
the
very
definition
of
indecency
said,
when
there's
a
risk
that
children
may
be
watching.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
well,
with
regard
to
public
and
leased
access
specifically,
it
did
not
affect
these
regulations
but
did
give
the
cable
operator
the
independent
power
to
ban
editorially
for
obscenity,
nudity,
or
indecency,
which
would
not
be
affected
by
this
case.
with
regard
to
all
other
channels
on
the
cable,
it
gave
in
sections
504
and
505
a
right
to
the
parent
or
the
cable
subscriber
to
call
in
and
ask
that
the
cable
be
blocked
from
its
home.
now,
it's...
i
will
tell
you,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
pretend
to
be
an
expert.
there's
confusion
in
that
statute
about
whether
you
can
only
block
things
you
don't
subscribe
to,
or
whether
you
block
things
that
you
subscribe
to
and
become
a
nonsubscriber,
but
there
is
a
way
of
dealing
with
that
in
the
new
law.
with
regard
to
broadcast
channels,
they
have
the
v
chip.
they
have...
the
broadcast
channels
have
a
year
to
come
up
with
a
voluntary
rating
system,
and
congress
has
required
that
every
television
set
has
to
be
built
so
that
it
can
pick
up
the
microelectronic
wave
and
block
something
that's
indecent
or
violent.
so
when
we
say...
here
we're
talking
about
the
potential
of
a
total
ban
by
cable
companies
who
congress
in
findings
in
1984
said
they
don't
like
public
access
because
it
takes
away
their
valuable
channel
space
and
they
frankly
just
don't
like
these
people
in
jeans
and
earrings
walking
around
telling
big-time
cable
operators
what
they're
going
to
put
on
these
channels.
congress
made
that
finding,
not
in
those
words,
to
be
sure,
but
they
certainly
made
that
clear.
and
basically,
with
regard
to
state
action,
our
view
is
this
court
has
made
it
clear
when
a
law
imposes
burdens
on
speech
based
on
content,
it
is
subject
not
only
to
first
amendment
scrutiny
but
to
the
most
exacting
scrutiny.
this
law
poses
burdens
on
the
public,
who
are
allowed
by
municipalities
to
come
onto
the
thing
if
they
self-identify
themselves
as
being
indecent.
that's--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--except
that
this
was
created
an
exception
to
the
editorial
ban
in
fact,
de
facto
exception.
they
could
for
indecency,
and
in
fact
in
the
new
law
it
does
make
it
clear...
not
that
i
think
it
really
had
to,
but
it
does
make
it
clear
that
the
editors
can
ban
for
obscenity,
indecency,
and
now
nudity.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
that's
exactly
right.
now,
one
other
thing
that's
important,
the
cable
operators
came
to
the
fcc
and
said,
wait
a
minute,
our
franchise
agreements
won't
let
us
do
this.
now,
these
agreements
are
off
of
30
years
in
the
making.
the
community
said,
don't
editorialize,
and
the
cable
operators
said,
well,
in
(a)
and
(c)
you
gave
us
discretion,
but
if
we're
bound
by
the
contracts
we
can't
use
our
discretion,
and
the
fcc
construed
the
statute
and
said
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
not
only
future
franchising
agreements,
but
franchising
agreements
that
were
already
in
existence,
and
in
1984,
congress
was
so
worried
about
the
expectations
in
the
contracts
between
municipalities
and
the
cable
companies,
they
said,
you
can
preempt,
but
you
can't
preempt
existing
contracts.
that's
section
557
of
the
cable
act.
all
of
a
sudden,
out
of
the
clear
blue,
all
of
these
expectations
pushed
to
the
side,
based
on
a
supposed
harm,
a
posited
harm
but
not
a
proven
harm,
and
certainly
not
based
on
the
least
restrictive
means.
we
can
offer
many
suggestions
of
less
restrictive
means.
have
the
parent
call
the
cable
company
and
block
the
channel.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
right.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
it's
accepted,
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
in
fact,
we
support
it.
our
one
argument,
it
isn't
proven
here,
and
with
regard
to
least
restrictive
means,
it's
not
proven
that
this
is
the
least
restrictive
means.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
that's
a
very
good
question,
justice
souter.
congress
made
findings
in
1984
that
lock
boxes
were
fine.
the
fcc
in
implementing
them
said
lock
boxes
are
fine.
congress
has
made
no
findings
here.
they
didn't
even
mention
lock
boxes,
that
parents
are
inert
or
don't
use
lock
boxes
and,
in
fact,
the
d.c.
circuit
uses
not
the
least
restrictive
means
test
but
the
most
effective
means
test,
because
they
thought,
without
any
guidance
from
congress,
that
yes,
some
parents
may
be
inert,
but
there's
no
finding
to
that
effect
at
all.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
justice
scalia,
i
use
the
word--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--i
stand
corrected.
that's
exactly
the
proper
way
to
put
it.
substantial
evidence
from
which
this
court
can
make
a
decision.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
in
the
sable
case,
justice
white
made
it
clear
this
court
cannot
make
de
novo
judgments.
the
first
judgments
has
to
be
made
by
congress.
you
can
review
the
judgment,
you
can
review
it
independently,
but
this
court
is
not
free
to
see
if
something
is
done--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--substantial
evidence.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
substantial
evidence.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
no,
no,
no,
that's
wrong,
justice
scalia.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
congress
has
to
make...
provide
substantial
evidence
in
the
first
instance.
you
get
to
review
it,
decide
whether
it's
satisfactory
enough
to
meet
the
least
restrictive
means
test.
you
can't
make,
i
can't
make,
cable
companies
can't
make
the
judgment
of
when
the
first--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--the
outcome
of
the
case
would
be
much
more
difficult.
it
might
very
well
be
different,
because
then
they
might
say
we
have
a
compelling
reason,
parents
aren't
watching
their
children,
now
we've
got
to
step
in,
this
is
the
least
restrictive
means.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
your
honor,
my
reading
of
the
sable
case
and
the
term
plurality
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
justice
white
said
you
can't
take
judicial
notice.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
you
could,
your
honor,
but
here
the
question
is--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--you
can
take...
my
question
is,
can
you
take
judicial
notice
that
public
and
leased
access
channels
throughout
the
country
are
purveying
indecency,
and
indecency
is
coming
from
those
channels?
you
would
need
expertise
and
help
on
that,
i
do
believe.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
your
honor,
my
view
is
that--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--in
others
it
can
when
it's
so
obvious
as
to
be
unarguable.
that
there's
violence
in
the
united
states,
in
my
view,
in
that
situation
congress
would
have
made
that
clear.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
i
think
you
do
have
to
look
those
findings
over
if
you're
applying
the
least
restrictive
means
test.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
right.
we
argue--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--no,
it's
not
the
view.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
the
definition
of
indecency,
which
is
another
argument
here,
is
so
broad
it's
way
beyond
the
definition
used
in
pacifica,
that
the
public
has
to
decide
what
the
cable
companies--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--yes,
it
is,
so
a
lot
is
swept
into
this
point,
but
our
basic
view
is
that
no
matter
what
happens
a
content-based
distinction
has
been
made
here.
all
decent
speech,
or
whatever
congress
thinks
is
decent,
automatically
has
a
right
to
get
on.
if
it's
indecent,
it
has
to
jump
through
hoops
and
is
subject
to
a
total
ban,
not
just
for
children,
but
for
adults.
there's
no
time
channeling
here.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
again,
the
sable
case
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
the
world
is
perfect.
what
you
have
to
prove
is
that
there's
a
real
problem...
and
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
the
restriction
is
perfect.
there
may
be
people
get
around
it...
that
it's
the
least
restrictive
means.
congress
is
required
to
go
through
that
analysis
by
substantial
evidence,
or
whatever--
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
--and
this
court
has
to
see
whether
they've
done
it.
mr.
i.
michael
greenberger
you
can
take
those
studies
into
account,
but
the
fact
is
that
even
if
that
were
true,
total
banning
is
not
the
least
restrictive
means.
we
know
that
from
section
10(b),
which
has
blocking,
and
parents
can
ask
to
see
the
stuff.
