the
trouble
that
i'm
having
with
this,
and
you
may
come
to
this
later,
in
which
case
at
some
point...
i
just...
is,
it
seems...
i'm
having...
i
find
this
very
difficult,
this
case,
in
part
because
it
seems
to
me
there
are
first
amendment
rights
on
both
sides.
it
isn't
just
that
there's
a
first
amendment
right
of
a
person
who
wants
to
originate
a
program
of
a
certain
kind
and
those
who
want
to
perhaps
see
this
particular
program.
there's
also
a
first
amendment
right
as
an
editor
of
a
person
who
provides
transmission.
if
this
were
the
new
york
times
or
abc,
or
nbc
news,
et
cetera,
would
you
feel
the
same
way?
wouldn't
it
be
obvious?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they...
how...
that's
important,
because
it's
a
question
of
what
framework
we
think
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
why...
look,
i'm
not
certain
that
this
is
a
correct
way
to
view
it,
but
they
are
people
who
provide
to
other
people
lots
of
messages,
and
they
have
to,
of
course,
use
a
cable,
and
nbc
has
to
use
a
piece
of
property
where
they
broadcast
through
the
air.
the
air
was
controlled
by
the
public,
the
spectrum
was
controlled
by
the
public,
so
is
the
cable
place
controlled
by
the
public.
i'm
not
saying
it's
determinative.
i'm
simply
saying,
don't
we
have
an
instance,
and
why
not,
where
there
are
first
amendment
rights
versus
first
amendment
rights--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
first
amendment
rights
against
something
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
respect
to
that,
i've
one
question
on
this.
let
me
assume
that
(a)
and
(c),
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
just
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
they're
treating...
they're
giving
the
channels,
the
cable
operator
the
same
kind
of
discretion
in
respect
to
this
patently
offensive
material
as
nbc,
abc,
or
newspapers
normally
have,
all
right.
that
would
take
care
of
(a)
and
(c).
that's
your
assumption.
now,
let's
look
at
(b).
in
respect
to
(b),
i
take
it
the
status
quo
is
that
a
person
has
a
locked
box,
and
he
can
turn
off
any
indecent
program
that
any
cable
operator
sends,
but
if
the
cable
operator
doesn't
originate
that
program
but
it
comes
over
a
leased
channel,
then
the
lock
box
is
irrelevant.
it's
not
a
question
of
consumer
choice.
rather,
there
it's
automatically
blocked,
and
to
get
that
you
have
to
write
30
days
in
advance.
all
right.
now,
i
want
to
know
what
sense
of
any
sort
that
makes.
i
mean,
if,
in
fact,
you
are
justifying,
because
there
are
first
amendment
interests
on
both
sides,
a
rational
basis
test,
how
could
it
be
rational,
or
anything
a
little
beyond
rational,
if
you're
a
little
tougher,
to
say
that
62
channels
for
their
indecent
material,
it's
of
course
a
system
where
the
person
at
home
turns
a
key
to
block
it,
but
for
the
eight
channels
that
are
leased,
in
fact
to
get
that
the
person
at
home
has
to
write
and
give
his
name
30
days
in
advance?
now,
i
just
don't
understand.
that
was
judge
edwards'
point,
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
just
don't
understand
the
rationality
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--lock
box?
