justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
greenberger,
in
judging
the
burden,
may
i
ask
you
just
to
advert
to
(a)
and
(c)
for
a
moment.
am
i
correct
that
with
the
exception
of
what
i
will
generally
just
call
indecency
there
is
still
a
federal
statutory
ban
on
any
editorial
control
by
the
cable
operators?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
we're
faced
with
a
statutory
regime
in
which
it's
not
the
case
that
the
statute
is
blank
and
suddenly
congress
says,
by
the
way,
you
can
censor
for
indecency.
what
we've
got
is
a
scheme
in
which
congress
has
said,
you
may
not
censor,
you
may
not
exercise
any
editorial
control,
but
you
may
exercise
it
for
indecency.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
your
argument
on
least
restrictive
means
i
think
leaves
out
one
ingredient
of
the
government's
argument,
and
the
government's
argument
is
the
argument
from
inertia.
it
may
very
well
be
that
i
would
agree
with
you
on
least
restrictive
means
if
i
made
the
assumption
that
the
parents
were
sitting
there
and
making
decisions
as
to
whether
they
really
want
the
kids
to
see
it
or
whether
they
don't.
what's
the
response
to
inertia?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
illegitimate--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
is
it
illegitimate
for
us
to
draw
our
own
conclusions
about
the
probability
of
parental
inertia?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i...
we
don't
have
to
find...
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
we
don't
have
to
find
that
these
channels
are
purveying
indecency.
what
we
have
to
be
satisfied
about
are
facts
that
would
go
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
application
of
the
statute
if
there
is
an
opportunity
to
apply
it.
all
we
have
to
conclude
about
indecency
is
that
if
there
is
such
a
thing
being
purveyed,
the
statute
would
work
in
one
way
or
it
would
work
in
another
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
claiming
that
the
statute
is
going
to
be...
maybe
you
are
claiming
that
the
statute
is
going
to
be
applied
on
a
pretextual
basis,
not
because
necessarily
there's
indecency,
but
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
pretext
to
keep
the
people
in
the
jeans
and
the
earrings
from
broadcasting,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
is
that
the
argument
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
grant
you
that,
but
that
is,
too,
a
separate
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
you...
i
suppose
you
win,
accepting
your
premises,
if
we
assume
there
is
one
instance
of
indecency
somewhere
on
some
channel
across
the
united
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
just
a
different
question?
i
guess
it's
the
one
that
follows
the
chief
justice's
question
of
a
moment
ago.
he
spoke
of
our
taking
judicial
notice
of
our
problem
of
violent
crime.
i'm
going
to
make
a
suggestion
which
may
have
no
application.
i
don't
know.
what
if
there
were
on
the
record
study
after
study
after
study
by
supposedly
disinterested
academics
to
the
effect
that
(a)
there's
indecency
coming
over
these
channels,
and
(b)
america's
parents
are
inert.
let's
assume
the
studies
show
that
52
percent
of
american
parents
suffer
from
total
inertia
on
the
subject.
[laughter]
congress
didn't
happen
to
allude
to
them
in
the
legislative
history.
could
we
take
those
studies
into
consideration?
justice
david
h.
souter
to
pay
the
fee
you've
got
to
give
your
name,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that...
and
that's
correct,
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
there's
no
way
to
put
a
penny
in
a
box
or
something,
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
congress
influencing
it,
because
if
congress
did
nothing,
there
would
be
complete
freedom
to...
for
either
party
to
censor
or
not,
as
he
sees
fit.
by
acting,
congress
says,
you
either
editorialize,
or
you
block.
that
has
an
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
can't,
i
suppose,
assess...
certainly
your
opponent's
position
is
that
you
can't
assess
the
significance
of
(a)
without
noticing
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
default
situation
provided
by
(b).
justice
david
h.
souter
would
the
answer
be
different
if
it
were
a
disclosure
to
the
government?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
but
aren't
there
three
elements
that
have
got
to
be
weighed
here?
number
1,
you've
got
a
general
statutory
scheme
that
says
no
editorializing,
and
then
the
government
says,
but
it's
okay
in
cases
of
indecency.
there's
kind
of
a
wink
there.
number
2,
the
government
says,
if
you
don't
exercise
editorial
control
you've
got
to
find
out
what
is
indecent,
and
you've
got
to
block
it
out.
and
number
3,
the
government
says,
if
anybody
wants
it
unblocked,
they've
got
to
make
an
affirmative
act
to
that
effect
and
sort
of
put
their
name
on
file
with
the
cable
operator.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
are
three
sources
of
burden.
how
do
we
weight
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
operator
does
have
the
burden
of
the
choice
of
saying
okay,
once
i
find
that
this
is
going
to
be
coming
over
my
cables,
i've
either...
i
either
have
got
to
say,
you
can't
do
it,
or
i've
got
to
block
it.
