we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-340,
united
food
&
commercial
workers
union
local
751
v.
the
brown
group
doing
business
as
brown
shoe
company.
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
damages
sought
are
back
pay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
liquidated--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
do
you
think
the
reasoning
of
the
eighth
circuit
was
that,
conceding
that
congress
has
authorized
this,
it
violates
article
iii
to
authorize
it,
or
simply
that
it
was
not
clear
that
congress
had
authorized
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
mr.
jenkins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
jenkins--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
does
seem
that
the
remedy
granted
is
not
particularly
designed
to
redress
the
union's
injury,
if
it's
back
pay
for
all
the
members.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that?
i
mean,
ordinarily
you
think
if
the
party
who
is
wronged
by...
the
union
in
this
case,
wronged,
as
you
say,
by
the
lack
of
notice,
that
the
damages
ought
to
be
measured
by
what
harm
that
is
done
the
union,
rather
than
what
harm
is
done
its
members.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
plant
where
there
is
no
union
representing
the
employees?
to
whom
does
the
notice
go
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jenkins.
mr.
walsh,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
does
that
follow
from
the
statute?
i
mean,
if
the
union
is
the
plaintiff,
the
thing
doesn't
even
go
to
the
union
as
a
trustee,
the
award
is
directly
to
the
individuals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
not
before
the
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
not
before
this
court
because
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
so
we
would
ordinarily
take
no
action
with
respect
to
any
such
assertion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walsh.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
gold,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
the
case
is
submitted.
