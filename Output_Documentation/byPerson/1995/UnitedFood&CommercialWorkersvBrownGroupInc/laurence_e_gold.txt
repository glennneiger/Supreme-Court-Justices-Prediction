mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
last
term,
this
court
in
north
star
steel
company
summarized
the
basic
aspects
of
the
warn
act,
which
is
the
statute
which
generates
this
case
as
well.
we
set
out
the
pertinent
portion
of
the
court's
opinion
on
page
9
of
our
opening
brief,
the
blue
brief,
and
very
simply
stated
as
the
court
noted
warn
is
a
statute
which
puts
a
condition
on
employers
on
plant
closings
and
mass
layoffs.
the
employer
is
supposed
to
notify,
among
others,
each
representative
of
the
affected
employees
if
the
facility
is
one
in
which
the
employees
have
an
exclusive
representative.
an
employer
who
violates
the
notice
provision
is
liable
for
penalties
by
way
of
a
civil
action
that
may
be
brought
in
any
district
court,
and
as
the
court
concluded
by
noting,
the
class
of
plaintiffs
includes
both
aggrieved
employees
or
their
unions
as
representatives,
who
may
collect
back
pay
for
each
day
of
violation
not
to
exceed
60
days.
in
this
case,
the
union
brought
a
warn
act
case
concerning
a
plant
closing,
alleging
that
brown
group
had
proceeded
without
providing
the
proper
notice.
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
the
union
did
not
have
standing
to
bring
and
prosecute
that
lawsuit
and
to
seek
the
statutory
remedy.
we
believe
the
standing
holding
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
plainly
wrong.
we
begin
from--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--right,
the
violation
of
its
right
to
get
the
notice--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the
nature
of
the
notice
right
is
not
one
which
inures
to
the
union
as
an
institution,
as
a
person.
the
point
of
the
act,
as
the
sponsors
noted,
and
we
quote
this
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief,
is
that
as
the
collective
bargaining
agent,
the
exclusive
representative,
whether
it
be
an
international
union,
a
regional
union,
or
a
local
union,
has
the
responsibility
and
authority
to
address
changes
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
the
effects
of
a
plant
closing,
and
cooperative
efforts
at
worker
readjustment.
so
the
union
gets
the
notice
in
order
to
facilitate
employee
readjustment,
retraining,
job
location,
to
deal
with
the
employer
in
ways
which
may
even
alleviate
the
entire
problem,
and
as...
what
congress
saw
is
that
if
the
employer
does
not
provide
the
notice,
the
union
is
harmed
by
losing
the
opportunity
to
provide
those
representative
services.
and
what
congress
determined
was
that
where
the
notice
isn't
provided,
and
where
employees
do
not
get
the
opportunity
to
have
this
period
of
readjustment
with
assured
income,
the
closest
that
was
appropriate,
because
congress
particularly
made
the
judgment
that
injunctive
relief
would
not
lie,
that
the
closest
that
was
appropriate
was,
in
essence,
a
form
of
specific
performance.
you
will
get
60
days
with
this
assured
money
at
some
point,
and
have
the
opportunity,
some
opportunity
for
readjustment
in
that
way.
so
the
union,
by
providing
the
substitute,
is
redressing
the
injury
that
it
suffered
by
this
invasion
of
its
legal
right.
now,
certainly
we
would
not
have
balked,
and
i
am
certain
that
we
lobbied
for
institutional
direct
relief
as
well,
but
the
proposition
that
this
is
not
relief
that
redresses
the
lost
opportunities
that
are
generated
by
the
violation
of
the
union's
legal
right
seems
to
me
to
be
without
substance
or
reason.
this
is
a
form
of
redressing
this
particular
form
of
legal
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
correct.
they
are
in
an
amount
of
back
pay.
they're
not
exactly
back
pay
as
we
normally
understand
that
term.
it's
a
formula.
every
day
without
notice
generates
a
certain
amount
per
employee,
whether
or
not
that
employee
actually
found
another
job
or...
it's
a
formula.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
liquidated
damages
or
penalties
is
what
was
referred
to.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
can
only
say
that
at
the
time...
this
was
1992...
people
who
brought
the
case
read
the
statute
and
proceeded
in
the
way
that
they
believed
was
right.
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
congress
did
what
it
did
is
that
for
people
who
are
thrown
out
in
the
job
market,
and
so
on,
to
be
the
named
plaintiff
in
this
kind
of
suit
is
something
of
a
burden.
you're
going
to
get
a
certain
disinclination
among
individuals
to
do
that,
and
this
was
a
purposely
simplified
approach.
i
quite
agree
that
you
could,
and
maybe,
in
the
fullness
of
hindsight,
might
wish
to
do
a
belt
and
suspenders
approach,
and
both
have
the
union
sue
and
have
an
individual
sue
as
an
aggrieved
employee
and
as
a
class
representative.
that's
going
to
complicate
the
proceedings
some,
and
i
can
only
say
that
we
don't
believe
it
is
what
congress
required
here,
any
more
than
it
would
be
required
where
a
union
brings
a
suit
of
comparable
character
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
oh,
absolutely.
i
mean,
we
believe
that
in
this
kind
of
case,
as
in
a
case
like
eoc
and
general
telephone,
you
have
the
union
acting
for
and
on
behalf
of
these
individuals.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
believe
that
this
is
a
direct
standing
case.
i
don't
know
whether...
i'm
on
the
verge
of
discussing
whether
this
is
a
true
class
action
in
rule
23
terms.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
absolutely.
i
mean,
our
overall
point
in
meeting
the
arguments
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
that
there
is
a
range
of
representative
litigation
of
this
kind
that
situations
of
a
pure
association
member
kind
is
only
one
example,
and
that
this,
like
the
collective
bargaining
contract
situation,
or
the
third
party
beneficiary
situation,
is
a
different
form
of
representative
or--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
i...
we
understand
the
eighth
circuit
to
have
said
that
congress
couldn't
proceed
this
way.
they
said
that
congress
formulated
the
employer
duty
and
the
union
right,
as
the
statute
plainly
does,
that
the
union
had
the
right
to
bring
suit,
but
that
the
union
didn't
have
standing
to
seek
the
only
remedy
for
the
violation
of
this
legal
right
that
congress
had
created.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
there
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it
is
the
conjunction.
employers
have
no
duty
to
give
notice
unless
they're
closing
or
engaging
in
a
mass
layoff.
this
is
not
an
abstract
situation.
i
agree
with
that.
if
the
employer
never
closes
the
plant
there's
no
lawsuit,
but--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
i
was
going
to
say,
in
conjunction,
the...
there
is
no
obligation
under
this
statute
to
provide
abstract
information
that
has...
about
something
that
has
no
direct
effect
on
the
people
getting
the
notice.
it
is
the
conjunction
of
an
intention
to
close
or
engage
in
a
mass
layoff.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
but
in
the
trustee
situation--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--all
right,
but--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the
beneficiaries
aren't
incapable,
and
in
this
situation
you
do
have
a
situation
that
congress
took
very
much
into
account.
the
union
is
selected
by
the
group
of
affected
employees
through
a
government
regulated
process
as
their
exclusive
representative.
a
union,
as
such,
cannot
bring
the
suit,
only
an
exclusive
representative
selected
by
the
employees.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right,
and
it
has...
one
of
its
representational
existences
is
to
negotiate
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
bring
suits
like
this,
if
there
is
a
breach,
to
collect
back
pay
and
other
remedies
for
the
individuals.
the
notice
runs
to
the
union,
as
the
passage
i
indicated
to
you
indicates,
so
that
the
union
can
carry
out
these
representational
functions,
so
you're
well
into
the
central
area
of
the
kind
of
representative
that
congress
certainly
can
authorize
to
bring
this
kind
of
lawsuit.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that
was
yet
another...
that
is
yet
another
example
of
the
fact
that
these...
that
representational
litigation
is
not
so
narrowly
defined
as
to
be
for
people
who
are
incapable.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
don't
think
that...
first
of
all,
congress
purposely
simplified
the
remedy
here
so
that
it
is
according
to
a
formula
and
based
on
back
pay.
beyond
that,
i
don't
believe
that
the
individuals
have
to
come
in
in
order
to
perfect
their
rights.
if
the
union
proves
that
there's
a
closing
without
the
notice
and
shows
the
payroll
records
and
who
worked
and
who
didn't,
it
has
proved
up
the
case
and
the
liability.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
terms
of
the
article
iii
point
that
justice
souter
was
pursuing,
the
court
has
decided
the
general
telephone
case,
the
alamo
case
where
the
government
sues
to
enforce
a
public
right
and
to
get
individual
payments
to
people
who
were
harmed.
if
this
was
an
article
iii
question,
title
vii,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
as
well
as
section
301
would
all
be
beyond
the
court's
powers.
i
would
also
note
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
determination
by
congress
that
injunctive
relief,
which
would
keep
the
plan
open,
is
not
available.
if
injunctive
relief
had
been
provided
and
the
union
had
sued,
it
would
be
plain
to
everyone
here
that
the
union
had
standing
to
bring
a
suit.
this
back
pay
is
the
substitute
that
congress
provided.
we
don't
believe
that
article
iii
means
that
the
best
is
the
enemy
of
the
good
in
this
sense
and
precludes
congress
from
making
this
kind
of
measured
judgment,
which
is
very
much
in
the
interests
of
defendants,
i
would
note.
thank
you.
