mr.
alan
jenkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
has
standing
to
sue
under
the
warn
act
both
in
its
own
right
and
as
a
representative
of
terminated
employees.
under
direct
standing
principles,
there's
no
dispute
that
congress,
through
the
warn
act,
imposed
a
legal
duty
on
respondent
to
give
petitioner
60
days'
notice
of
the
shutdown
of
the
dixon
plant.
petitioner
has
alleged
a
breach
of
that
legal
duty
and,
in
doing
so,
has
established
a
direct
and
personal
injury
to
itself.
that
injury
is
neither
hypothetical
nor
speculative.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
an
abstract
violation
occurs
and
anyone
in
the
universe
has
standing
or
even
a
cause
of
action
to
challenge
it.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
union
itself
was
denied
the
notice
that
it
has
a
right
to
under
the
statute.
mr.
alan
jenkins
pardon
me.
mr.
alan
jenkins
we
think
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
congress
provided
unions
right
to
notice
precisely
in
order
to
facilitate
their
role
in
the
readjustment
and
retraining
process.
that
process...
pardon
me,
that
role
is
frustrated
by
the
lack
of
notice,
and
it's
vindicated
by
an
award
of
back
pay
to
injured
employees.
mr.
alan
jenkins
we
think
that's
correct,
but
the
nature
of
the
injury
in
this
instance
is
a
harm,
a
frustration
of
the
union's
ability
to
participate
in
its
statutory
role
and
in
its
organizational
role,
to
participate
both
in
the
retraining
and
readjustment
process
which
congress
found
notice
to
be
relevant
to,
and
its
ability
to
function
as
a
collective
bargaining
representative
under
the
labor
laws.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
don't
think
so,
although
i
do
think
that
deterrence
is
certainly
one
of
the
goals
that
congress
had
in
mind.
but
i
think
in
this
instance,
for
example...
a
union
doesn't
receive
notice.
the
plant
shuts
down.
damages
to
the
union
would
not
speak
to
the
union's
role
in
aiding
the
employees
that
it
represents
in
the
work
place,
nor
would
an
injunction
reopening
a
plant
years
after
it's
closed,
even
if
that
were
feasible,
speak
directly
to
the
union's
lost
opportunities
and
lost
ability
to
speak
to
the
financial
stability
of
the
employees
that
are
represented.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
but
it...
that
would
be
one
remedy
that
would
speak
to
that
harm,
but
under
article
iii
the
requirement
is
simply
that
the
remedy
sought
be
likely
to
redress
the
injury,
not
that
it
necessarily
be
the
best
remedy
to
redress
that.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i...
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
that's
the
only
way
to
tie
this
right
to
the
remedy
that's
imposed.
the
congress
recognized
that
terminated
employees
are
much
better
able
to
participate,
work
with
unions
and
other
resources
for
retraining
and
job
adjustment,
if
they
have
the
financial
stability
to
do
so
and,
of
course,
that
makes
sense,
that
if
someone's
receiving
a
paycheck,
they
can
go
out,
obtain
additional
education,
learn
new
skills,
look
for
jobs.
it's
much
easier
to
do
that,
and
the
union's
role
in
that
process
is
greatly
facilitated.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
for
many
employees--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
certainly
temporally
that's
true,
but
i
think
the
warn
act
is
aimed
in
particular
at
large
scale
layoffs
in
communities
that
are
dependent
upon
particular
industries,
and
so
those
employees
will
still
be
around,
and
the
union
will
still
have
the
ability,
as
will
the
state
dislocated
worker
unit
and
the
unit
of
local
government,
which
also
have
a
right
to
notice
under
the
statute,
will
have
the
ability
to
work
with
those
employees.
i
think
that
was
what
congress--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
don't--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
alan
jenkins
the
first
reason
is
that
unions
are
unique
in
that
they
have
a
right
to
notice
under
the
statute.
the
aclu,
general
people
out
in
the
community
don't
have
a
statutory
right
to
notice.
they
also
don't
have
the
statutory
relationship.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
that's
correct.
then
there
would
still
be
a--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--there
would
still
be
a
requirement
under
article
iii
that
there
be
a
tangible
effect
on
the
plaintiff
through
the
union
of
the
layoff.
a
simple
ideological
disagreement
with
an
abstract
violation
of
law
doesn't
satisfy
article
iii.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct,
but
this
court
has
frequently
recognized
that
that
type
of
impairment
of
an
organization's
ability
to
carry
out
its
functions
not
simply
a
disagreement
or
an
ideological
conflict
with
action
taken
is
sufficient
to
provide
an
injury
in
fact
for
article
iii
purposes.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
don't
think
that's
entirely
so,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
it's
true
that
the
union
has
its
own
independent
injury.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
jenkins
we
think
certainly
so,
and
that
was
my
point
in
saying
that
there's
a
right
to
notice
here,
and
as
you
pointed
out,
it's
an
exclusive
right
to
notice.
it
would
not
be
sufficient
for
respondent
to
have
simply
notified
some
employees
but
not
the
union.
the
union
must
be
notified
to
satisfy
the
warn
act.
mr.
alan
jenkins
the
notice
goes
directly
to
the
employees
under
that
circumstance,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
perhaps
it
would
be
weaker
in
that
narrow
respect.
i
don't
think
article
iii
standing
would
be
lacking
as
long
as
a
union
has
a
legal
right
that's
been
breached,
and
there
are
practical
consequences
of
that
right,
and
in
addition
the
union
has
been
affected
in
a
way
that
distinguishes
it
from
the
public
at
large.
it
would
not
be
enough.
it
would
be
comparable
to
the
lujan
case
if
everyone
in
the
world
had
a
right
to
challenge
an
employer's
failure
to
give
notice.
here,
there
are
certain
specifically
designated
parties
who
are
affected
in
a
practical
way,
and
therefore
have
a
right
to
notice
in
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute.
mr.
alan
jenkins
may
i
answer?
mr.
alan
jenkins
there
is
a
fee
shifting
provision
and
i
believe
it's
discretionary
with
the
district
court.
thank
you.
