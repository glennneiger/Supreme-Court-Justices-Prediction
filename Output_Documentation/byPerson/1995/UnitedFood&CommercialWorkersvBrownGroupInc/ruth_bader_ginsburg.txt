--mr.
gold,
what
is
the
standard
procedure
in
these
cases?
it
struck
me
that
if
you
had
joined
one
worker
suing
on
behalf
of
herself
and
others
similarly
situated,
that
you
would
have
obviated
this
problem,
and
i
was
wondering,
since
it
appears
later
several
workers
came
forward
to
make
claims,
why
that
wasn't
done
from
the
beginning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
that
to
determine
the
compensation
the
employees
must
come
into
this
lawsuit
as
individuals?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jenkins,
is
it
relevant
to
this
inquiry
that
the
union
is
not
stepping
forward
as
a
union?
it
has
standing
under
this
statute
only
as
exclusive
bargaining
agent
of
the
employees,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
workers
get
the
notice,
personally,
when
the
union
is
not
representing
the
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
the
union
is,
that
only
the
union
is
entitled
to
notice
under
the
statute
and
the
workers
aren't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
does
that
distinguish
the
situation
of
the
union
that
has
this
preexisting
representational
obligation
from
an
organization
that
is
merely
a
do
good
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
that
respect
it
would
be
no
different
than
if
one
employee
had
stepped
forward
and
sued
on
behalf
of
the
276
similarly
situated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
we
get
into
the
question
of
characterization,
do
i
understand
that
nothing
more
would
be
required
than
payroll
records
to
determine
the
compensation
due
here?
it's
not
a
question
of
credibility,
just
a
question
of
how
many
hours,
how
many
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
can
understand
that
it
might
be
a
complex
formula,
but
i
don't
understand
why
the
testimony...
if
you
have
time
records,
why
the
testimony
of
the
employee
would
be
necessary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
agreed
with
me
before
that
you
could
have
one
class
representative,
only
one
named
representative
suing
on
behalf
of
all
similarly
situated,
and
that
would
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
for
liability
purposes,
why
shouldn't
we
say
the
same
thing
about
the
union?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
concentrating
on
this
case,
if
the
union
had
joined
one
member,
then
you
would
see
no
problem
and
everything
could
go
forward
without
article
iii
impediment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
that
is
so...
there
would
be
no
article
iii
impediment,
i
think
you're
agreeing...
then
in
view
of
the
debate
that
has
been
going
on
here
and
among
other
courts,
at
the
very
least,
shouldn't
the
union
be
allowed
to
amend
its
complaint
to
join
a
member,
and
then
everything
else
follows.
