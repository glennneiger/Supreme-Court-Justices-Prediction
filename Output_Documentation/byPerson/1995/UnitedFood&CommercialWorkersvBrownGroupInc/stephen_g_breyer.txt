justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
it's
both,
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
doesn't
it
help
the
union
to
give
the
employees
their
money?
i
mean,
the
whole
point
of
the
act,
isn't
it,
is
to
give
the
union,
just
as
mr.
gold
said,
notice
so
it
has
some
time
to
arrange
for
the
employees
to
get
training
or
other
benefits?
it
lost
that
time.
it
failed
in
its
duty
to
the
employees
because
they
didn't
get
notice.
well,
at
least
it
can
get
money
for
them.
i
mean,
isn't
that
something
that
unions
are
there
for,
to
help
the
employees
by
getting
them
money,
by
getting
them
training,
by
getting
other
things,
and
a
failure
to
get
notice
inhibits
that
obligation
of
the
union,
which
is
what
its
purpose
is.
why
can't
congress
under
the...
what
in
the
constitution
prevents
congress
from
saying...
congress
wants
to
say
we'll
restore
the
union
not
completely,
but
we'll
restore
the
union
roughly
to
where
it
might
have
been,
not
by
giving
the
employees
training,
we
can't,
but
at
least
we'll
give
them
some
extra
money?
where
in
the
constitution
does
it
say
that
congress
can't
make
that
judgment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
statute
says
that
a
union
can
come
in,
sue
when
it
doesn't
get
notice,
and
collect
liquidated
damages
in
an
amount
equal
to
the
number
of
days
times
the
average
wage,
which
presumably
it
pays
to
the
workers,
so
the
workers
then
think,
well...
i
don't
know,
does
it
pay
it
to
the
workers
or
not?
maybe
it
just...
i
don't
know
what
happens
to
it,
but
i
think
the
workers
might
feel
better
about
it
if
the
union
has
it
rather
than
the
employer.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
question
i
was
trying
to
ask
is,
why
isn't
the
remedy
aimed
at
redressing
a
real
harm
to
the
union,
namely,
its
inability
to
help
its
workers
by
arranging
for
some
interim
relief
for
the
workers?
what
this
does
is,
it
gives
the
workers
some
money.
that
isn't
precisely
what
the
union
would
have
arranged
for,
though
it
might
have
done.
rather,
it's
roughly
the
kind
of
benefit
the
union
could
have
arranged
for,
so
the
statute
says,
pay
them
that.
at
least
that's
what
i
read
the
statute
as
doing,
irrespective
of
the
statute's
motive.
all
i'm
looking
for
is,
is
that
helping
a
little
bit
to
redress
a
harm,
and
my
question
is
under
the
constitution,
why
doesn't
that
help
redress
somewhat
a
harm
that
the
union
really
suffered?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
injury
that
is
being
redressed
is
the
failure
to
get
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
couldn't
enforce
that
contract
in
a
diversity
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
i've
a
different
question,
which
is...
the
question
that
i'd
have
would
be,
what
about
the
associational
standing?
why,
in
a
contract
case,
i
take
it
a
supplier
and
a
company
could
get
up
a
contract
and
a
measure
of
damages
for
the
breach
of
the
contract
might
have
to
be
what
the
company
had
to
pay
all
of
its
employees,
right?
you
could
have
such
a
contract
case,
of
course.
and
now
you
don't
have
to
bring
the
employees
into
court.
they
aren't
a
necessary
part
of
the
case,
so
why
do
you
say
here
that
the
measure
of
damages,
which
happens
to
be
the
wages
that
would
be
paid
to
the
employees,
makes
the
employees
under
washington
apple
necessary
participants
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
same
would
be
true
in
a
contract
action.
the
same
could
easily
be
true
in
an
action
for
breach
of
contract,
or
some
kind
of
trust
action,
where
the
measure
of
damages
turns
on
precisely
the
same
matters
that
you're
just
describing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no,
but
i
mean,
my
point
is,
why
does
it
require
the
employee
to
come
into
court
or
to
be
a
participant
in
the
case,
any
more
than
in
a
breach
of
contract
action
where
the
measure
of
damages
is
wages
paid
to
individual
employees,
any
more
than
that
kind
of
case
requires
an
employee
to
come
into
court?
it
might,
but
you
might
prove
it
from
paper,
or
you
might
prove
it
in
a
hundred
ways.
it
might
not
even
be
disputed.
