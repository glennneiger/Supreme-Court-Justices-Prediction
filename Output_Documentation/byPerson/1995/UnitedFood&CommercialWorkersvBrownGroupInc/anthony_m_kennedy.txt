it
would
seem
odd
that
if
notice
were
also
required
to
the
employees
that
you
would
have
a
weaker
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
said
one
of
the
reasons
the
union
has
standing
here
is
because
the
union
is
the
only
one
to
get
notice,
and
i
observed
it
would
be
a
rather
odd
statutory
scheme
if
the
notice
also
went
to
the
employees
that
you
would
then
have
a
weaker
representational
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
isn't
your--
--a
statutory
right
would
be
on
even
a
higher
order.
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
if
the
parties
by
contract
can,
in
effect,
confer
standing,
that
congress
by
a
specific
statute
can
do
the
same
thing,
which
is
the
thrust
of
justice
stevens'
point.
