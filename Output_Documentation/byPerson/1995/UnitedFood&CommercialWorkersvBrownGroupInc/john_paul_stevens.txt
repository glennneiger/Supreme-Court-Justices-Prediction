mr.
jenkins,
does
this
statute
provide
for
fees
to
the
plaintiffs?
who
pays
the
cost
of
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
walsh,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that's
concerning
me?
supposing
warn,
instead
of
being
a
statute,
was
all
spelled
out
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
provided
exactly
the
same
remedies
and
notice
requirements
and
all
the
rest,
and
the
employer
failed
to
give
notice
to
the
union
of
an
intended
plant
closing,
and
the
agreement
provided
in
that
event
the
union
could
sue
for
back
wages
payable
to
the
employees,
just
as
it...
measured
by,
just
the
same
remedy
here,
would
you
think
there
would
be
an
article
iii
problem
on
allowing
the
union
to
enforce
that
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
difference
between
a
contract
and
a
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
here
it
has
a
statutory
right,
there
it
has
a
contractual
right.
in
terms
of
injury
to
the
union,
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
has
a
statutory
right
that's
been
breached
here.
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
a
contract
right
entitled
to
greater
protection
than
a
statutory
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
this
statute
it's
the
litigating
agent
for
the
same
people.
i
don't
understand
the
difference,
in
terms
of
constitutional
terms.
why
is
one
injury
redressable
and
the
other
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
different
from
the
statutory
injury
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
admitted
there's
a
statutory
violation
of
a
duty
to
the
union.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
isn't
the
contractual
thing
a
procedural
injury,
then?
