justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gold,
you're
in
one
different
position
here,
i
suppose,
from
the
cba
situation,
because
you're
union
is
in
effect
a
statutory
representative,
so
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
a
union
member
as
a
party
doesn't
really
prevent
you
from
arguing
that
this
is
essentially
a
class
action.
and
while
it's
true,
i
suppose,
that
because
there's
no
union
member
who's
a
party,
there's
no
one
who's
a
named
plaintiff
who
is
going
to
get
damages,
but
i
don't
know
that
that's
an
article
iii
problem,
so
you
can
still
argue
that
it's
like
a
class
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
easy
way,
in
effect,
for
us
to
decide
this
case,
or
the
easiest,
you
might
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
know
it's
not
absolutely
like
it,
but
we're
worried
about
article
iii
here,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
it's,
the
analogy
is,
i
suppose,
close
enough
for
you
to
say
it's,
for
article
iii
purposes
you
ought
to
treat
it
just
like
a
class
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gold,
you
don't
concede,
do
you,
that
in
the
associational
standing
cases
the
members
of
the
association
are
incapable
of
suing?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they're
in
the
same
boat
as
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--union
members
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
these
damages
are
not
going
to
affect
that
in
this...
in
a
given
case.
don't...
aren't
you
reduced
to
saying
that
the
sense
in
which
there
is
a
vindication
of
the
union's
right
by
giving
damages
to
employees
is
essentially
on
a
deterrence
theory,
that
if
you
give
the
damages
to
the
employees
in
this
case,
the
next
employer
is
going
to
know
it,
and
is
going
to
give
the
notice?
isn't
that
as
close
as
you
can
come
to
a
vindication
of
the
union's
interest
in
receiving
the
notice?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
speak
to
it
would
be
an
injunction
against
the
plant
closing,
and
that
is
specifically
what
congress
withheld.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
injury,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
injury
to
the
union
in
depriving
it
of
a
capacity
either
to
negotiate
about
the
actual
decision
to
close,
or
to
retain
those
who
are
going
to
be
put
out
of
work,
and
the
only...
i
should
think
the
only
remedy
that
is
going
to
redress
or
vindicate
the
union's
interest
in
failing
to
receive
the
notice
would
be
a
remedy
that
gives
them
the
statutory
amount
of
time
to
do
that,
and
that
remedy
would
be
an
injunction
against
closing
the
plant
short
of
60
days
for
the
union
to
do
whatever
it
wants
to
do.
the
union
absolutely
cannot
get
that,
so
aren't
we
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
redress
for
the...
i
keep
saying
this...
vindication
of
the
union's
interest
as
such
simply
cannot
be
given
without
an
injunction
unless
you
in
effect
take
a
long
term
deterrence
analysis
and
say,
well,
if
it...
if
the
union
can
make
it
hurt
this
time
by
getting
damages
for
a
third
party,
the
next
employer
won't
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
don't...
as
a
practical
matter,
they
don't
get
the
money
during
the
time
in
which
they
would
want
to
be
doing
this,
do
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
talking...
you're
making
a
very
practical
argument.
you're
saying
the
employee
who
is
getting
the
paycheck
can
afford,
in
at
least
two
senses,
to
go
to
school
and
do
the...
and
get
the
retraining,
but
in
fact
the
employee
is
not
going
to
get
the
paycheck
until
some
period
considerably
down
the
road
when
the
lawsuit
finally
grinds
to
an
end,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
it
may
take
a
long
time
to
get
the
money,
but
it's
going
to
take
a
long
time
to
retrain
and
get
another
job.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
they
ultimately
can
match.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
relationship
between
that
requirement
and
our
associational
standing
cases,
because
in
the
associational
standing
cases,
the
association
doesn't
necessarily
get
any
relief.
it's
members
that
do.
does
that...
is
the
consequence
of
that
that
the
relationship
between
redressability
and
redressability
to
the
named
plaintiff
is
not
an
article
iii
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
none
of
those
requirements
say
that
there
has
got
to
be
a
redress
flowing
directly
to
the
association.
not
that...
there's
no
requirement
that
the
association
in
a
damages
case
get
damages.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
case
in
which
they
have
done
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
the
cases
in
which
there
has
been
equitable
relief,
the
benefit
of
the
equitable
relief
has
always
been
for
the
members
of
the
association,
hasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
organization
without
that
attribution
does
not,
in
fact,
have
an
interest
which
would
be
vindicated
if
it
alone
sued.
if
the
applegrowers,
whatever
the
association
was,
walked
into
court
and
said,
we
are
not
representing
the
members
of
our
association...
this
is
just
us,
applegrowers,
inc.,
or
whatever
they
were
called...
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
relief
that
they
would
have
been
entitled
to,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
they
were
reaching
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
they
never
have.
i
mean,
we--
justice
david
h.
souter
--haven't
held
that
they
couldn't,
and
that's
what
you
want
us
to
do
here,
i
realize,
but
we
never
have.
i
don't
understand
why
it
wouldn't
follow.
i
mean,
you
say
their
members
have
been
injured,
and
that's
enough,
that
their
members
have
been
injured.
you
acknowledge
that...
for
injunctive
relief.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it
is
the
case
that
the
union
and
the
association
members
are
not
suffering
the
same
harm.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
example
you
gave,
the
applegrowers'
case,
the
association
is
saying,
we're
losing
members.
that
isn't
what
the
members
are
saying,
so
you
can't
say
that
the...
i
don't
think
you
can
properly
say
that
the
analysis
depends
upon
everyone
suffering
the
same
wrong
and
hence
everyone,
association
and
members,
getting
the
same
benefit
from
the
injunction
and,
therefore,
if
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
they
have
a
kind
of
representative
standing,
then
that
representative
standing
depends
upon
their
asserting
something
that
the
association
itself
could
not
or
would
not
assert.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
well,
i
want
to
be
sure,
but
just
on
the
terms
that
i
just
gave
you,
doesn't
it
follow
that
you
can't
make
the
argument
that
they
are
all
in
the
same
boat?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we've
called
it
that
repeatedly,
haven't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
don't
we...
let
me
ask
you
a
related
question.
don't
we
have
to
treat
it
that
way,
or
we're
going
to
be
in
trouble
in
class
actions?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
now,
third
hunt
prong,
i
thought
we
had
characterized
that,
number
1,
as
being
merely
prudential,
and
number
2,
if
we
don't
so
characterize
it,
are
we
going
to
be
in
conflict,
in
effect,
with
class
action
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
hasn't
it
been
called
prudential?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
third
prong...
i
think
we're
talking
about
the
same
third
prong,
which
is
that
it
does
not
require
the
appearance
of
individual
third
parties
to
prove
their
damage...
supply
the
evidence
for
the
specific
damages
that
they
have
suffered,
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
well,
in
a
class
action
which
includes
a
damage
remedy,
ultimately
before
the
action
is
over
the
unnamed
third
parties
have...
strike
third
parties.
the
unnamed
class
members
who
got
to
prove
their
damages,
or
there
has
got
to
be
proof
of
their
damages,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
why
wouldn't
that
offend
the
hunt
prong
if
the
hunt...
if
the
third
hunt
prong
is
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
not
the
requirement
we're
talking
about.
we're
talking
about
the
third
prong
that
says,
you
can't
have
associational
standing
if
you
have
to
bring
in
third
parties,
i.e.,
members
of
the
association,
to
prove
their
claims,
and
the
question
is
whether
that's
an
article
iii
requirement.
if
it
is
an
article
iii
requirement,
why
isn't
it
by
analogy
an
article
iii
requirement
in
class
action
cases,
and
it
seems
not
to
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
has
his
own
injury,
but
before
the
class
action
is
over,
the
injuries
of
other
people
have
got
to
be
shown,
and
those
other
people
are
in
the
same
boat,
aren't
they,
as
the
association
members?
justice
david
h.
souter
for
article
iii
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
not
article
iii.
that
is
to
say,
prudential.
do
you
have
any
other
reasons
why
associational
standing
won't
wash
here?
it's
just
the
third
prong,
that's
the
only
objection
you
have
to
associational
standing?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect,
i'm
missing
that
point.
i
don't
see
why
the
third
prong
is
based
on
lack
of
injury.
the
third
prong
is
a
limitation
on
proof
of
other's
injury.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
it's...
i'm
concerned
as
to
whether
it's
a
rule
of
prudence
or
a
rule
of
article
iii
standing.
maybe
you
shouldn't
concede,
mr.
walsh,
that
class
actions
are
associational
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it
has
everything
to
do
with
what
article
iii
requires,
which
applies
to
class
actions
as
well
as
associational
standing
cases,
and
if
the
same
objection
could
be
raised
in
the
class
action
case
that
could
be
raised
in
the
associational
standing
case,
and
it
is
not
effective
in
the
class
action
case,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
has
to
follow
that
it's
not
an
article
third
requirement
in
the
associational
standing
case,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know,
but
they're
both...
class
actions
in
associational
action
cases
are,
standing
cases,
are
subject
to
the
same
bedrock
article
iii
standing
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
it
doesn't
apply
in
one,
then
it
can't
be
an
article
iii
requirement
for
the
other.
that's
the
only
argument
i'm
making,
and
i
don't
think
i
have
an
answer
from
you
yet
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
i'd
just
be
quiet
and
let
you
answer,
i--
[laughter]
--you'd
have
an
easier
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
there's
no
problem
in
the
fact
that
there
has
to
be
extraneous
proof
of
the
various
damages
for
the
various
class
members
once
he's
in,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
know,
it
may
make
him
nasty,
and
we
may
not
certify
the
class
for
just
that
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at
least
there's
no
constitutional
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
right?
no
constitutional
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
no
article
iii
problem,
standing
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we've
never...
i
don't...
and
i
will
stand
corrected
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
don't
think
we've
ever
given...
our
court
has
ever
given
that
as
the
reason.
i
think
the
reason
has
always
been
a
manageability
reason.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
