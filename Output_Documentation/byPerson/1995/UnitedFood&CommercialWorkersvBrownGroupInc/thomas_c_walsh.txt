mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
the
past
20
or
so
years
this
court
has
reiterated
what
it
has
called
the
irreducible
constitutional
minima
for
standing
to
sue
in
the
federal
courts,
and
two
of
those
minimal
requirements
are
involved
in
this
case,
in
our
opinion.
the
first,
of
course,
is
injury
in
fact.
this
court's
cases
require
that
the
injury
claimed
by
the
plaintiff
be
concrete,
real,
immediate,
palpable,
not
speculative,
not
conjectural,
not
abstract,
and
that
injury
must
be
to
a
legally
protectable
interest.
the
second
element
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
that
of
redressability,
which
requires
that
relief
from
the
injury
must
be
likely
to
follow
for
the
plaintiff
from
a
favorable
decision,
and
it
must
redress
the
injury
to
the
complaining
party
even
though
the
judgment
may
benefit
others
collaterally.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no.
in
the
associational
standing
cases,
and
that's
the
hunt
v.
washington
applegrowers
line
of
cases,
the
requirement
is
that
an
association,
in
order
to
sue
on
behalf
of
its
members,
must
show
three
things,
first
that
some
of
its
members
have
injury;
second,
that
the
lawsuit
is
germane
to
the
association's
interests;
and
thirdly,
that
the
participation
of
the
individuals
is
not
required
for
complete
adjudication.
now--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
the
law
has
been
universal
that
an
association
cannot
sue
for
damages
to
its
members.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
it's
been
for
both,
i
think,
justice
souter.
i
think
when
you're
talking
about
declaratory
or
equitable
relief
in
an
associational
context,
i
think
the
analysis
is
that
that
is
a
communal
type
of
relief
which
redresses
what's
deemed
to
be
a
collective
injury,
so
there
is
injury
of
the
members
that's
attributed
to
the
organization,
and
therefore--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
in
that
case
actually
they
did
have
an
interest
because
they
claimed
that
they
were
losing...
they
would
lose
dues
if
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--said
statute
were
not
overturned.
but
they
could
not
walk
in
and
say,
we
are
suing
on
behalf
of
our
members
for
their
lost
profits,
for
instance,
or
their
damages,
and
that's
the
disconnect--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes.
it
depends
on
the
relief
being
sought.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
don't
think
so.
when
you're
talking
about
damages,
justice
scalia,
you
can't
have
the
collective
type
of
analysis
that
you
have
when
you're
talking
about
injunctive
relief,
that
all
together
there,
everybody's
suffering
the
same
wrong.
it's
attributed
to
the
organization
by
reason
of
it
happening
to
the
members,
but
when
it's
damages,
it's
clearly--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
if
that
were
the
case,
that
each
union
or
association
member
were
entitled
to
a
different
form
of
relief,
then
i
think
you
would
have
the
same
kind
of
problem
with
that
as
you
would
with
a
damage
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
depends
on--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
as
the
court
said
in
warth
and
in
brock
again,
the
ability--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--that's
probably
true.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
where
they
are
close
enough
to
being
in
the
same
boat
that
the
relief
sought
will
remedy
the
communal
wrong,
that's
the
rationale
for
allowing
associational
injunctive
cases
and
for
disallowing
damage
cases,
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--the
problem
is,
justice
breyer,
that
there's
no
evidence
anywhere
that
congress
made
such
a--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--the
statute
is
silent
on
the
purpose
of
the
notice.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
there
is
nothing
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
statute
itself
which
suggests
that
that
is
the
so
called
injury
that's
being
redressed.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
money
would
go
to
the
individuals.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
they
have
filed
here
on
behalf
of...
that's
the
language
of
the
complaint,
on
behalf
of
the
individuals.
now,
that,
to
me
means
the
check
that
we
would
have
to
cut
if
we
lost
would
be
payable
to
the
individuals
probably,
but
the
union
also
on
the
check.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
statute
does
contemplate
class
actions,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
i
don't
think
that
could
apply
to
the
damage
part
of
the
case
for
the
same
reasons
that
we've
discussed--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
because
first
of
all,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
breyer,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
suggests
that
that's
the
injury
that's
being
redressed.
there
are
two
other
statutes
that
were
enacted
at
approximately
the
same--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--the
lack
of
notice
to
the
union.
now,
there's
another
statute
which
requires
notice
to
the
local
job
partnership,
the
state
job
partnership,
and
there's
a
statute
that
says
that
that's
the
organization
that
is
supposed
to
bring
the
parties
together
once
the
plant
closing
is
announced.
it's
supposed
to
notify
the
union
within
48
hours
of
it
being
notified,
so
even
if
the
union
didn't
get
notice
here,
it's
required
to
get
notice
under
that
statute,
and
that's
the
one
that
determines
all
these
rights
and
remedies
that
the
union's
talking
about
here,
the
relocation.
there's
also
the
job
training
partnership
act,
which
was
enacted
at
about
the
same
time.
those
deal
with
the
kinds
of
concerns
that
have
been
mentioned
here.
this
is
simply
a
failure
to
give
notice
and
a
remedy
to
the
union,
which
in
legislative
history
and
in
the
statute
and
in
the
pleadings,
i
might
add,
there
is
no
articulation
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--no,
i
do
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
because
the
union
there
is
a
party
to
the
contract.
a
breach
of
the
contract--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--the
injury
to
the
union
is
that
it
is
a
party
to
a
contract
that
has
been
breached.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
before
with
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--because
the
union
is
not
designated
as
the
litigating
agent
of
claims,
statutory
claims
for
its
members.
it
is
under
section
301
and
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
the
litigating
agent
for
breaches
of
the
claim--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--because
as
the
party
to
the
contract
that
has
been
breached
it
has
an
injury.
in
this
situation--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--we
contend
there
is
no
statutory
injury
in
fact.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
that
creates
a
procedural
injury,
in
our
view,
to
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--because
it's
a
breach
of
a
substantive
right
under
the
contract
to
notice
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
congress
certainly
can
create
rights
the
violation
of
which
will
justify
article
iii
standing,
but
it
has
to
be
a
real
right,
it
has
to
be
a
substantive
right,
and
the
violation
of
it
has
to
create
an
injury
in
fact,
and
merely
saying
that
you
have
to
give
somebody
notice
does
not,
in
our
opinion,
create
anything
more
than
a
procedural
right
where
it's
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i'd
say
you
couldn't
enforce
that
contract--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i
would
think
so.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
don't
know.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
because
each
of
the
individualized
determinations
of
damages
for
these
employees
depends
on
a
number
of
variables,
including
his
wage
rate,
his
piece
rate,
how
many
days
he
was
entitled
to
notice
but
he
didn't
get
it,
what
his
benefits
were--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
if
i
am
the
party
to
the
contract,
then
i
have
a
substantive
right
to
enforce
that
contract
and
collect
damages
for
those
who
are
properly
aligned
with
me.
now,
i
can't
collect
damages
for
the
whole
world,
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
that
is
the
hunt
test,
and
the
hunt
test
is,
the
third
prong
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
in
that
situation,
in
the
absence
of
a
contract
or
other
substantive
right,
the
association
as
such
does
not
have
an
injury.
the
association
is
not
itself
injured,
so
it
is
not
permitted
to
assert
others'
rights
in
trying
to
prop
up
its
own
right.
now,
the
government
tries
to
say
that
this
is
a
prudential
requirement,
but
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
i--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--no,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
so.
first
of
all,
the
government
has
mischaracterized
this
prudential
limitation,
which
it
says
is
underlying
the
third
hunt
factor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
some
of
these
piece
rates,
i'm
told,
justice
ginsburg,
vary
from
day
to
day,
from
hour
to
hour,
even,
so
it
takes
an
incredible
amount
of
calculation
and
actually
interviews
probably
with
the
individual
employees
to
determine
what
they're
entitled
to
from
hour
to
hour
and
day
to
day,
so
it
is
a
very
highly--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--oh,
i
think
it's
the
participation
of
the
employee
that's
the
key.
the
employee,
because
he
is
seeking
his
own
damage
remedy,
has
to
come
in
and
be
part
of
the
case
because--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i
said
for
liability
purposes
only,
but
when
you
get
to
damages,
then
the
individual
determinations
under
rule
23,
in
our
opinion,
would
outweigh
the
class
deter--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--because
the
only
remedy
that's
permitted
under
this
act
is
this
back
pay
remedy.
there
is
no
injunctive
relief.
there
is
no
declaratory
relief.
it's
either
back
pay
for
these
members,
or
it's
nothing.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
sir.
it
has
not
ever
been
characterized
as
prudential.
where
it
has
been
discussed
in
hunt
and
warth
and
brock,
it
has
been
discussed
in
the
context
of
a
constitutional
requirement.
what
is
confusing
about
it--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--no.
actually,
the
actual
prudential
rule
that
the
government
is
referring
to
but
which
it
mischaracterizes
is
one
which
says
a
plaintiff
may
not
rest
his
legal
claim
upon
the
legal
interests
or
legal
rights
of
a
third
party,
and
that,
of
course,
appeared
in
warth
v.
seldin,
and
the
court
in
warth
cited
for
that
proposition
tilerston
v.
oman,
and
tilerston
v.
oman
was
a
1943
case
where
a
physician
tried
to
claim
that
an
act
was
unconstitutional
in
restricting
access
to
contraceptives.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes.
yes,
sir.
there
were--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
this--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
i
don't
read
it--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
this
analysis
was
reiterated
in
brock,
and
what
it
means
is...
this
prudential
requirement
that
the
government
is
relying
on
means
that
i
can't
try
to
prop
up
my
claim
by
asserting
the
constitutional
rights
of
third
parties.
that's
prudential.
the
court
can
allow
me
to
do
it,
but
it
has
not
allowed
me
to.
but
that's
not
what
brock
is...
that's
not
what
hunt
is
about.
hunt
is
about
an
association
asserting
damage
claims
for
members
of
that
association
without
having
any
injury
to
itself.
that's
totally
different,
and
that's
article
iii
material.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
does--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--yes.
it
does
not
require
the
participation
of
third
parties.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
because
in
a
class
action,
the
plaintiff
is
a
member
of
the
class.
the
plaintiff
is
injured.
the
plaintiff
therefore
has
the
right,
under
rule
23--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--because
in
the
class
action,
the
plaintiff
has
his
own
injury.
in
the
hunt
context,
the
association--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well...
and
in
a
lot
of
those
cases,
where
the
individual
circumstances,
damages
if
you
will,
are
diverse,
courts
routinely
deny
class
action
treatment.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
for--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--for
manageability
purposes.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
there
is
a
question,
i
think,
about
whether
there's
germaneness,
but
we
haven't
briefed
that,
but
we
do
think...
the
third...
the
eighth
circuit
decided
that
the
third
prong
of
hunt
had
not
been
met,
and
clearly
it
hasn't.
so
the
question
then
is,
is
it
prudential,
can
congress
override
it,
or
is
it
constitutional,
and
because
it's
based
upon
the
lack
of
injury
to
the
organization,
and
also
because--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--it's
not
a
rule
of
evidence,
justice
souter.
it's--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i
don't
think
i--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i
don't
think
i
did.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
don't
think
class
actions
are
associational.
i
think
the
plaintiff
is
an
individual--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--that's
my
view.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
class
actions
are
not
associational
actions.
class
actions
are--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
the
first
question
is,
does
the
plaintiff--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
i'm
sorry,
but
i'm
doing
my
best.
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--the...
in
the
class
action
context,
the
plaintiff
is
a
member
of
the
class
who's
been
injured.
he
has
his
own
claim,
so
he
is
in
court,
he's
properly
in
court,
and
there's
no
article
iii
problem.
then
it's
a
procedural
question
whether
he
should
be
able
to
represent
under
rule
23
others
similarly
situated,
but
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
there
may
be--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i
don't
really
know.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
generally
that's
correct--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i
would
agree,
but
i
think
it
could
create
a
problem
if
one
plaintiff
would
try
to
recover
for
mass
tort
victims,
for
instance,
without
joining
those
people
in.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
if
the
union
had
joined
one
member,
and
that
member
had
asserted
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
himself,
and
he
would
be
injured,
on
behalf
of
himself
and
others
similarly
situated--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--then
possibly
that
would
be
an
appropriate
determination
of
liability
only.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
union
refused,
despite
repeated
admonitions
in
the
lower
court,
to
ask
for
leave
to
amend
until
after
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court
then,
for
the
first
time,
they
asked
for
leave
to
amend,
came
in
and
said
we'd
like
to
join
the
class
members.
the
judge
said,
"where
have
you
been
for
the
last
year
and
a
half?
"
"denied.
"
they
contested
that
before
the
eighth
circuit.
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
on
that
basis.
they
did
not
include
that
in
their
cert
petition
in
this
court,
and
that
is
the
law
of
the
case
at
this
point,
so
amendment
of
the
complaint
to
join
additional
class
members
in
our
view
is
no
longer
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
correct.
it's...
but
a
remand
by
this
court
to
allow
that
to
happen
would--
mr.
thomas
c.

--that's
correct,
yes,
your
honor.
the
union
has
repeatedly
based
its
claim
here
on
the
fact
that
congress
has
acted
and
congress
has
the
right
to
create
standing.
now,
congress,
indeed,
has
the
right
to
create
capacity
to
sue,
but
the
party
seeking
the
review
must
still
be
among
the
injured,
and
as
justice
kennedy
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
lujan,
congress
at
very
least
must
identify
the
injury
it
seeks
to
vindicate
and
relate
the
injury
to
the
class
of
persons
entitled
to
bring
suit.
the
only
way
that
works
in
this
case
is
if
we
speculate
about
what
the
injury
was
and
how
it
relates
to
the
union,
and
it
is
not
unprecedented
for
this
court
to
strike
down
statutes
which
purport
to
allow
people
to
sue
for
a
violation
of
article
iii.
back
in
1911
in
the
muskrat
case,
two
individuals
were
authorized
to
sue
to
determine
the
title
to
some
cherokee
indian
lands.
the
supreme
court
held
that
there
was
no
case
or
controversy,
that
article
iii
will
not
permit
advisory
opinions--

you.
