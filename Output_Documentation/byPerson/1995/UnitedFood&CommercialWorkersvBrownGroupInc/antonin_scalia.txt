justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gold,
why
is
the
injury
in
this
case
the
failure
to
give
notice?
had
there
been
a
failure
to
give
notice
and
the
plant
never
been
closed,
there
would
have
been
no
problem,
i
assume,
right?
it
seems
to
me
the
injury
is
the
closing
of
the
plant,
isn't
it,
without
having
given
the
notice
beforehand?
had
the
plant
not
closed,
there
would
have
been
no
violation,
no
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i
have
a
sort
of
instinctive
resistance
to
the
notion
that
you
can
create
purely
abstract
procedural
rights,
like
the
right
of
everybody
in
the
world,
or
the
right
of
a
particular
union
to
"notice"
without
any
substance
behind
the
notice.
what
i
see
to
be
the
violation,
here,
is
not
the
failure
to
give
the
notice
but
the
closing
of
the
plant.
that's
what
hurt
people,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
no
objection
to
my
considering
the
injury
in
this
case
to
be
not
the
failure
to
receive
notice
but
the
closing
of
the
plant,
without
having
done
that
beforehand,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
another
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
want
us
to
pursue
the
theory
that
justice
souter
was
asking
you
about
of
representational
capacity
on
the
part
of
a
union,
i'm...
again,
my
problem
is
i'm
reluctant
to
acknowledge
that
for
article
iii
purposes
congress
can
make
anybody
the
representative
of
anybody
else
and
just
say,
you
know,
for
purposes
of
vindicating
this
right,
you
know,
john
doe
shall
have
standing
to
sue.
most
of
the
representational
cases
i
know
involve
a
plaintiff
who
is
incapable
of
suing,
so
his
executor
sues,
or
his
trustee.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trustee
owns
the
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
the
person
really
interested
can't
sue.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
is
not
an
organization
formed
just
for
the
purpose
of
this
suit.
it
has
some
independent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--representational
existence.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
consequence
of
that
argument
that
any
organization
which
has
the
interest
of
others
at
heart
can
be
given
standing
to
sue
for
injuries
to
those
others,
because,
after
all,
that's
the
organization's
function?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
suppose
the
american
civil
liberties
union
could
be
given
standing
to
sue
for
any
deprivation
of
civil
liberties
to
anyone
in
the
country,
because
their
whole
ratiocination
is
to
serve
those
people
and
prevent
those
injuries.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
is
this
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
yes,
but
that's
just
to
say
that
congress
has
created
it
here,
and
i'm
saying
congress
could
also
create
it
for
the
aclu.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what's
your
other
argument?
why
else
is
it
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
tangible
effect
here
was
that
it
was
unable
to
provide
the
kind
of
assistance
to
the
people
served
that
it
wanted
to,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
remedy
given
is
not
the
remedy
of
providing
the
people
what
the
people
are
entitled
to.
it
is,
rather,
a
remedy
directed
to
the
organization.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
attribute
their
members
injuries
to
the
association,
why
not
attribute
their
members
compensation
for
the
injuries
to
the
association?
i
mean,
doesn't
the
one
follow
from
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
wrong
can
be
a
very
individualized
wrong
that
the
injunction
is
addressed
against,
for
example,
not
paying
a
certain
level
of
wages,
which
the
association
claims
each
individual
employee
is
entitled
to.
you
get
a
mandatory
injunction
requiring
that
additional--
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well
then--
--the
union...
the
money
doesn't
go
to
the
union,
does
it?
i
thought
the
money
went
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
goes
directly
to
workers.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
it
cannot
be
true
that
any
right
which
could
be
acquired
by
contract,
any
right
to
sue
which
could
be
acquired
by
contract
can,
since
it
can
be
acquired
by
contract,
be
conferred
by
congress
without
violating
the
separation
of
powers.
i
mean,
i
can
acquire
contractual
rights
to
do
all
sorts
of
good
things
for
all
sorts
of
people.
does
this
mean
that
congress
can,
when
i
have
not
entered
such
a
contract,
give
you
the
right
to
sue
on
behalf
of
those
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
end
of
the
doctrine
of
standing,
i
would
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
warth
came
from
a
prudential
error.
i
mean,
anything
you're
basing
on
warth
has
been
superseded
as
far
as
principle
is
concerned
by
later
standing
cases.
was
not
warth
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
whole
function
of
standing
is
to
assure
concrete
adversariness?
isn't
that
the
language
that
was
in
warth?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
been
effectively
overruled
by
later
cases,
which
say
its
purpose
is
not
to
assure
concrete
adversariness
alone,
but
rather
that
it
has
a
constitutional
component,
which
is
what
warth
explicitly
denied,
that
it
had
any
constitutional
component.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you're
trying
to
make
your
case
from
warth,
you're
going
to
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble
because
warth
says
the
whole
thing
is
prudential.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
there's
concrete
adversariness,
which
there
surely
is
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
seem
to
have
accepted
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
thought
in
these
associational
cases
the
association
cannot
demonstrate
any
injury
to
itself,
and
it
is
relying
entirely
upon
the
injury
to
its
members.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
we
do
with
class
actions
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
third
prong.
