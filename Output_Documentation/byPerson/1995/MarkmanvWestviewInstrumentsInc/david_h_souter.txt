justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
opponents
argue,
if
i
understand
it,
that
there
is
an
issue
today,
the
issue
in
this
case,
that
was
not
a
jury
issue,
in
fact
was
not
understood
as
an
independent
issue
at
the
time
that
you
refer
to
as
your
standard
of
practice,
and
that
was
there
was
not
the
modern
notion
of
patent
claim,
and
therefore
there
was
not
an
issue
of
construing
a
patent
claim.
your
opponents
say
that
the
two
kinds
of
issues
that
the
old
juries
considered
were
issues
of
enablement
and
i
guess
issues
of
just
design
identity.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
say
the
specifications
that
you're
talking
about
are
simply
different
kinds
of
statements
from
the
statement
of
claim.
and
you
say
in
your
reply
brief,
well,
the
word
claim
was
not
used
in
the
18th
and
early
19th
century
as
it
is
used
today,
but
that
issue
was
still
there.
and
i...
you
may
be
right
on
that,
but
i
just
i
guess
couldn't
follow
you
to
your
conclusion.
how
do
we
know
the
issue
was
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
that
a
physical
description
of
the
invention?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
know,
this
is
a
box
and
it
has
a
crank
and
a
door--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and
that's
something
quite
different
from
what
we're
talking
about
in
the
modern
sense
of
claim
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
the
specification
of
the
early
cases
includes
the
claim
as
we
understand
it
today.
that's...
is
that
in
a
nutshell
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
take
it
the
specification--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that
were
going
to
be
our
basis
for
decision,
we
wouldn't
be
deciding
very
much,
would
we?
because
we
would
simply
be
saying
that
in
a
patent
case,
as
in
any
other
case,
if
there
is
no
dispute
of
fact
as
to
which
there
could
be
reasonable
disagreement
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
court
must
declare
the
conclusion.
and
that
wouldn't
really
decide
very
much,
would
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
if
we
don't
decide
on
that
extremely
narrow
ground,
do
we
have
to
decide
as
globally
as
the
circuit
did?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
if
you're
to
decide
something
broader
than
that,
can
we
decide
it
on
a
basis
less
globally
than...
less
global
than
the
basis
that
the
circuit
employed?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understood
your
argument
to
be...
i
understood
you
to
be
arguing
two
things
in
your
brief.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
one
was
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
no
reasonable
jury
could
come
to
any
other
conclusion
anyway.
that's
the
narrow
ground.
i
also
understood
you
to
be
arguing
that
even
if
there
were
factual
disputes,
evidentiary
questions,
as
to
which
reasonable
jury
or
reasonable
fact
finders
might
come
to
differing
conclusions,
it
was
still
an
issue
for
the
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
latter
is
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
the
global
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
if
we're
not
going
to
decide
this
as
simply
a
case
about
the
particular
evidence
going
to
this
dry
cleaning
patent,
then
your
position
is
we
do
have
to
decide
it
as
globally
as
the
circuit
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
your...
i
want
to
make
sure.
i
understand
your
argument.
i
understood
your
reply
to
justice
scalia
in
effect
to
be
it
should
be
an
issue
of
law
for
the
court
because
that's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
get
national
uniformity.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
a
fair
summary
of
what
you
said?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
there
was...
at
one
point
in
your
brief...
and
in
fact
a
couple
of
times
this
morning...
i
thought
you
were
making
a
different
argument,
and
that
is
the
very
fact
that
patent
specifications
must
be
made
or
ideally
should
be
made
in
unambiguous
terms
somehow
means
or
results
that
you
don't
have
the
problems
of
construction
in
patent
documents
that
you
may
have
in
contract
documents.
patent
documents
are
somehow
less
likely
to
be
ambiguous,
less
likely
to
be
messy,
and
for
that
reason
it
makes
sense
to
say
there
should
be
no
jury
questions
in
their
construction.
i'll
be
candid
to
say
that
i
didn't
understand
why
that
should
be
so,
but
i
thought
at
one
point
you
were
arguing
that.
do
you
argue
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
supposed
to
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
know,
statutes
are
supposed
to
be
definite
too,
and
they're
frequently
not.
the
fact
that
it...
in
an
ideal
world
the
patent
documents
would
not
be
in
any
way
ambiguous
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
address
the
question
in
the
real
world
that
we've
got,
and
that
is,
how
do
you
determine
what
they
mean
when
you
can't
figure
it
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
understand
that,
but
we
get
into
court
because
there
is
a
dispute
about
what
a
phrase
means
or
a
sentence
means
or
a
word
means,
or
at
least
there
is
a
claim
of
a
dispute
about
that.
and
when
there
is
such
a
claim,
why
is
it
the
case
that
patent
documents
are
somehow
different
from
contract
documents
or
more
like
statutory
documents?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
claim
a
matter
of
subjective
intent?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
second
reason,
if
you
will,
is
basically
a
variant
on
the
first
reason.
your
second...
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying
now,
you're
saying,
look,
patent
documents
are
supposed
to
be
written
in
a
way
that
would
not
raise
questions
of
subjective
intent,
that
would
be
perfectly
clear
to
people
who
read
them,
and
so
on.
and
because
that's
the
way
they're
supposed
to
be
written,
we
should
not
treat
them
as
if
they
were
written
in
other
ways,
e.g.,
to
involve
questions
of
subjective
intent.
and,
therefore,
in
order
to
get
the
definiteness
that
patent
law
requires,
we
must
treat
this
as
a
matter
of
law
for
judges
only
so
that
we
can
ultimately
get
uniformity.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
your...
so,
your
first
argument
for
uniformity
is
buttressed
by,
in
effect,
what
you
say
is
the
intent
of
the
patent
statute
and
that
is
to
provide
some
uniformity.
and
this
is
the
only
way
you
can
get
it,
and
this
is,
therefore,
the
only
way
you
ought
to
read
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
okay.
but
that's
somewhat
contrary
to
the
intuition
one
would
get
from
the
fact
that
apparently
it's
agreed
that
expert
witnesses
are
necessary
in
almost
every
patent
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me.
the
one...
so,
you're
saying
the
one
is
a
matter
of
claim
construction.
that's
always
a
matter
of
law.
the
other
isn't
a
matter
of
claim
construction,
so
maybe
that
would
be
open
to
jury
findings?
justice
david
h.
souter
however,
if
you
do
leave
it
open
to
jury
findings,
what
happens
to
uniformity?
the
jury
on
the
west
coast
says,
gee,
it
seems
perfectly
obvious
to
us.
why
should
he
be
protected?
a
jury
on
the
east
coast
says
quite
the
opposite.
what
happens
to
uniformity
if
you
allow
that
exception?
haven't
you
got
to
go
the
whole
hog
here
and
say
all
of
the
issues
that
go
ultimately
to
the
enforceability
of
the
patent
have
got
to
be
treated
as
issues
of
law
because
otherwise
you
lose
your
uniformity?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
another
analogy
question,
and
i
should
have
done
it
before
but
i
didn't
think
of
it.
on
the
one
hand,
we've
got
the
case
of
statutory
construction,
construction
of
agency
regs,
and
so
on.
we
say
that's
always
a
matter
of
law.
it
never
goes
to
the
jury.
the
kind
of...
the
limits
of
meaning,
the
rules
by
which
we
find
meaning,
the
process
by
which
we
look
for,
quote,
evidence,
unquote,
of
meaning,
those
are
all
things
for...
that
courts
alone
can
do.
easy
case.
at
the
other
extreme,
you've
got
the
question
of
contract
construction,
and
as
you
pointed
out,
one
of
the
issues
in
contract
construction
may
well
be
an
issue
of
subjective
intent.
what
did
these
people
or
one
of
them
have
in
mind?
so,
that
makes
it
a
classic
kind
of
evidentiary
question.
and
you
said,
well,
here
in
a
patent
claim,
we
don't
have
an
issue
of
subjective
intent
simply
because
the
objects
of
stating
patent
claims
rule
out
that
as
a
legitimate
consideration,
and
i
will
accept
that.
but
isn't...
and
here
is
where
i
get
to
my
question.
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
the
terms
that
are
supposed
to
be
used
in
these
claims
are
terms
which
have
meaning
within
the
art
in
question?
so,
therefore,
the
matter
of
meaning
is
something
for
which
we
can
legitimately
look
outside
the
document.
and
isn't
there
a
strong
analogy
between
looking
for
the
understanding
of
the
art
or
the
trade,
something
outside
the
document,
and
looking
for
the
subjective
intent
of
parties,
which
is
also
outside
the
document?
the
evidence
bearing
on
them
may
be
different.
but
isn't
the
fact
finder
engaging
in
essentially
the
same
kind
fact
finding?
in
one
case
he's
saying
contracts,
what
did
they
specifically
have
in
mind
here?
in
the
other
case,
he's
saying,
what
does
this
whole
body
of
people
mean
by
this
term?
isn't
the
analogy
between
those
two
questions
a
strong
analogy?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
explain
that?
[laughter]
you
may
explain
briefly.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
you
wouldn't
use
the
term
if
you
weren't
writing
a
patent.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
it
is
not
as
exciting
as
the
one
that
justice
ginsburg
has
just
described
to
us.
the
issue
is
whether
the
construction
of
a
patent
falls
exclusively
within
the
province
of
the
court,
and
specifically
whether
the
seventh
amendment
requires
that
a
jury
decides
meaning
of
disputed
terms
of
art
within
the
patent
claim,
the
portion
of
the
patent
document
that
defines
the
patentee’s
rights.
the
petitioner
markman
owns
a
patent
to
a
system
that
keeps
track
of
clothing
as
it
moves
through
the
dry-cleaning
process.
markman
sued
the
respondent
westview
instruments
alleging
that
westview’s
products
infringe
the
patent.
although
the
jury
found
that
it
did
infringed
it,
the
district
court
granted
the
directive
verdict
nonetheless
on
the
ground
that
westview’s
device
in
contrast
to
markman’s
is
unable
to
track
what
was
described
as
inventory
as
that
word
is
used
in
the
patent
claim.
markman
appealed
arguing
that
the
seventh
amendment
required
the
jury
not
to
judge
to
interpret
the
term
inventory
when,
as
here,
evidences
introduced
to
trial
without
its
meaning.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
seventh
amendment
the
judges
construe
patent
term.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
seventh
amendment
right
of
trial
by
jury
is
the
right
which
existed
under
the
english
common
law
when
the
amendment
was
adapted
and
we
therefore
looked
to
18th
century
practice
to
assess
the
substance
of
the
common
law
right
that
the
seventh
amendment
was
intended
to
preserve.
given
that
infringement
case
arise
they
were
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
tried
before
a
jury,
we
have
to
determine
whether
particular
trial
issue,
here
a
patent
claim
construction,
must
be
decided
by
jury
in
order
to
preserve
the
essence
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
that
existed
at
the
appropriate
time.
there
is
no
direct
antecedent
to
modern
claim
construction
in
the
historical
sources
and
18th
century
patent
cases
reveal
no
analogous
practice
supporting
the
markman’s
contention
that
juries
construed
the
terms
of
the
patent.
to
the
extent
that
any
analog
responsible
it
seems
to
work
against
markman’s
position
in
fact.
accordingly
we
look
elsewhere
to
characterize
this
issue
in
order
to
allocate
it
as
between
judge
and
jury.
when
we
do
existing
precedents,
the
relative
interpretive
skills
of
judges
and
juries,
and
the
statutory
policy
considerations
to
all
favor
allocating
this
position
to
the
judge.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
construction
of
terms
within
a
patent
claim
or
even
terms
of
art
falls
within
the
province
of
the
court.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
