mr.
william
b.
mallin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
constitutional
case.
it
concerns
the
seventh
amendment
guarantee
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
on
infringement
issues
in
patent
infringement
actions
for
damages.
it
is
established
that
the
seventh
amendment
guarantees
the
constitutional
right
to
jury
trial
in
civil
cases
as
it
existed
in
1791
in
england.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
it
is
decisive
here
that
in
england
in
1791
the
meaning
of
the
terms
of
patents,
the
meaning
of
patent
specifications
were
submitted
to
the
jury.
consistent
with
that
common
law
practice,
that
became
the
early
understanding
in
the
united
states
and
that
early
understanding
was
confirmed
as
the
years
passed
by
outstanding
judges
noted
for
their
efforts
in
the
patent
area,
such
as
justice
thurey
in
the
mid-19th
century
and
judge
learned
hand
in
the
mid-20th
century.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
it...
judge
hand
indicates
that
the
issue
is
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
that
gets
us
under
the
seventh
amendment.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
for
two
reasons.
because
of
the
common
law
practice
and
also--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--under
the
understanding...
under
the
jurisprudence
of
the
seventh
amendment
under
decisions
of
this
case,
factual
issues
on
the
merits
of
a
claim
are
for
the
jury.
in
the
case--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--on
that
precise
point,
we
go
back
to
the
common
law
practice
where
in
liardet
v.
johnson,
awkwright
v.
nightingale,
and
other
cases
at
common
law
the
meaning
of
patent
terms
were
submitted
to
the
jury.
those
particular
cases
involved
validity
issues.
but
it
is...
was
understood
at
common
law
and
it
is
understood
in
law
today
that
the
patent
means
the
same
thing
for
infringement
as
it
does
for
validity.
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
otherwise.
a
patent
can't
mean
one
thing
at
one
stage
of
the
trial
and
another
thing
at
another
stage
of
the
trial.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes,
whether
there
was
sufficient
disclosure--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--whether
it
was
an
advancement
of
novelty
in
a
prior
art,
and
those
kind
of
issues
were
left
to
the
jury
which
necessarily
involved
the
jury
interpreting
what
the
specifications
mean
in
order
to
decide
whether--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--yes.
first
of
all,
at
common
law
it
had
a
specification
that
described
the
invention.
it
was
required
at
common
law
that
the--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--yes.
a
description
by
words.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
and
so
on--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--the
way
you
see
in
patents.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no,
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
and
let
me
explain.
first,
at
common
law
it
was
necessary
that
the
specifications
distinctly
enclose
what...
disclose
what
the
invention
was,
the
disclosure
part
of
it.
early
cases
showed
that
patents
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
would
often
end
with
the
words
i
claim
as
a
way
of
making
it
clear
as
to
what
the
claim
was.
eventually
in
the--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--pardon?
mr.
william
b.
mallin
i
claim.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
i
claim.
eventually
the
statute
in
1836
specifically
referred
to
the
word
claim.
the
statute
of
1870
had
a
specific
requirement,
that
is
the
modern
patent
practice,
that
the
specification
end
with
the
word
i
claim
and
then
set
forth
the
invention.
it
was
always
required
to
set
forth
the
invention.
this
is
just
a
particular
way
in
modern
practice
that
you
set
it
forth,
and
the
claim
in
modern
practice
is
interpreted
in
light
of
the
specifications.
it
would
be
rare
for
the
specification
not
to
include
a
term
that's
in
the
claim.
so,
our
position,
justice
souter,
is
that
that
formal
distinction,
that
rearranging
which
does
not
go
to
the
substance
of
the
matter
cannot
undermine
precedent
at
common
law
that...
where
judges,
lord
mansfield
in
particular,
the
name
of
the
judge
at
common
law,
submitted
the
interpretation
of
the
specification
to
the
jury.
the
formal
differences
in
claim
practices
cannot
eliminate
the
seventh
amendment
right.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
there's
no
substantive
difference
and
the
formalities
were
not
significantly
different--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--but
it
has
no
impact--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--and
it
has
no
impact
on
seventh
amendment
rights.
otherwise,
it
would
be
easy
to
get
rid
of
the
seventh
amendment
in
any
case.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
justice
ginsburg,
because
of
the
seventh
amendment.
the
standard
formula
that
we
often
hear
is
that
the
construction
of
the
claim,
the
construction
of
the
patent
is
an
ultimate
question
of
law,
but
until
recently
it
was
also
said
the
underlying
factual
disputes
are
for
the
fact
finder,
a
judge
when
it's
a
case
for
the
judge
or
a
jury
case.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
it's
determined
by
the
court
and
it
was
determined
by
the
court,
as
far
as
i
understand,
at
common
law.
i
think
the
judge's
decisions
on
the
facts
on
jurisdiction
would
be
appealable
under
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
it's
not...
the
effort
here,
your
honor,
is
to
say
this
matter
of
what
the
claim
means
is
a
legal
question
that...
it's
not
a
factual
question
at
all.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
it's
a
matter,
i
think,
of
terminology
there,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
think
it's
a
legal
question.
it
was
still
a
factual
question.
but
judges
in
all
kinds
of
civil
cases
take
disputes
away
from
the
jury
as
a
matter
of
law
because
there's
no
factual
support
for
it,
petitioners'
particular
contention.
the
judge
has
that
gatekeeper's
role
in
jury
cases
in
that
sense,
and
saying
that
something
doesn't
go
to
the
jury
because
the
judge
decides
it
as
a
matter
of
law
doesn't
change
the
issue
from
fact
to
a
legal
question,
it
simply
says
does
not--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--i...
like
any
factual
question
in
a
civil
jury
case,
if
the
judge
is
able
to
determine
that
it
is
clear
on
the
face
of
the
documents
and
there
is
no
genuine
dispute
of
fact,
then
the
judge
can
determine
that
question
as
a
matter
of
law
in
the
sense
i
indicated--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--no.
the
judge
in
these
cases...
the
trial
judge
first
held
that
this
was
a
legal
question,
exclusively
for
the
judge
in
every
case.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes,
there
was
a
short
concurring
opinion
where
a
concurring
judge
indicated
that
he
didn't
think
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
support
our
position.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
but
that
isn't
what
the
majority
did.
the
majority
said
that
the
question
was
a
legal
question
in
every
case--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--exclusively
for
judges.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
the
particular
question
in
the
case
was
whether
the
word
inventory
used
in
the
claim
in
the
specifications
was
limited
only
to
article
of
clothing
or
could
cover
a
dollar
inventory
reflected
by
invoices
and
dollars
associated
with
the
invoices.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
well,
it
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances,
but
if
the
issue
is
what
does
the
word
inventory
mean
in
the
particular
industry
that's
involved
in
a
contract,
professor
corbin
and
professor
williston
would
say
yes.
that
meaning
of
language
is
a
factual
question
in
a
jury
trial--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--well,
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
factual
question
to
go
to
the
jury,
someone
must
offer
evidence
on
it
as
to
its
meaning
to
the
industry
involved.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no.
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
analogy
is
in
the
particular
contract,
if
this
is
the
relevant
question,
what
does
inventory
mean
in
a
particular
industry
or
to
one
skilled
in
that.
and
the
patent
analogy
to
contract
is
made
sometimes,
but
we
have
to
remember
what
a
patent
and
its
term
is
talking
about.
in
a
patent
case,
the
question
is
what
the
term
means
to
one
skilled
in
the
art.
that
is
a
factual
question
of
what
it
means
to
one
skilled
in
the
art.
if
there's
no
real
factual
dispute,
like
any
other
case
the
judge
can
decide
it,
but
if
there's
factual
evidence--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--williston
and
corbin,
as
we
cite
in
our
brief,
in
some
cases
make
the
distinction
that
is
similar
to
the
distinction
in
patent
law,
that
the
construction
of
the
patent...
of
the
contract
in
your
hypothetical
is
for
the
court,
its
legal
effect,
but
if
there's
a
question
about
the
meaning
of
language,
that's
a
factual
dispute
to
be
resolved
as
a
factual
matter.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
the
interpretation
of
statutes
as
a
matter...
as
a
legal
matter
is
for
the
court.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
i
think
that
that's
a--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--very
collateral
way
because
of
the
direct
authority
from
the
common
law--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--that
would
be
a
factor,
and
on
that
issue,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
a
patent
is
not
like
a
statute.
it's
not
analogous
to
a
statute.
of
course,
it's
not
a
statute.
a
patent
is
not
a
publicly
piece...
a
publicly
enacted
piece
of
legislation
from
the
political
process.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
i
think
to
assert
the
uniformity
is
misdirected
and
contrary
to
the
seventh
amendment.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
it
would
be
nice
to
have
it,
but
it's
the
practicality
of
it.
it's
agreed
by
everybody,
including
the
majority,
that
in
order
to
interpret
the
terms
of
a
patent
to
one
skilled
in
the
art,
that
it's
appropriate
to
take
evidence,
and
whether
the
judge
is
deciding
that
or
the
jury
is
deciding
it,
the
evidence
has
to
be
looked
at.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
i
really
don't
know
quantitatively
whether
there
would
be
many,
but
there
are
many
cases
in
the
books
and
it's
settled
law
at
the
federal
circuit
level
that
in
order
to
interpret
the
patent,
that
it
is
appropriate
to
look
at
what
they
call
extrinsic
evidence:
what
happened
before
the
patent
office,
what
expert
testified,
the
state
of
the
prior
art.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
it--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--pardon
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
they're
intertwined
together
and
you
cannot
separate
the
one
from
the
other.
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
statute
analogy.
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
understand
that
in
200
years
of
litigation
over
patents
in
this
country
and
at
the
common
law,
as
far
as
we
can
find
or
has
been
cited,
the
analogy
to
a
statute
has
never
been
used
before
this
case
before
it
was--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--i
think
a
copyright
is
far
different
than
a
patent.
a
patent
is
not
a
land
grant.
i
have
difficulty
going
off
to
the
analogies
when
we
have
clear
seventh
amendment
rules
and
we
have
the
english
common
law
practice
that
has
been
cited.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
i
don't
know
that
it
has.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
i--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--it
would
have
to
be
looked
at,
the
common
law
action
to
which
the
seventh
amendment
attached.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
it's
a
tort
action.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
and
we're
not
here
contending
that
juries
ought
to
decide
meanings
of
statutes.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
patents
we
say,
on
the
authority
that
we
cite,
that
when
there's
a
genuine
dispute...
and
the
analogy
that
has
been
referred
to
at
common
law
and
by
this
court
has
been
an
analogy
to
contracts
not
statute.
take
a
malpractice
case
where
the
issue
is
what
a
medical
term
means
to
physicians.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
under
the
seventh
amendment
jurisprudence,
the
question
of
what
that
medical
term
means
to
physicians
would
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
in
the
malpractice
case,
my
hypothetical
could
include
wherever
that
medical
term
happened
to
be
used.
it
might
be
in
the
complete
instrument
or
not.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
the
rule
seems
to
be
there
that
the
material,
the
legal
material,
is
proved
as
a
fact
and
then
the
judges
look
at
the
statute--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--no.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
you
do
not.
that...
according
to
the
new
federal
rules
that
have
been
changed.
and
i
don't
know
that
that
has
ever
been
dealt
with--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--as
a
constitutional--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--i
would
like
to--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--your
honor,
in
that
situation
it's
clear
it's
foreign
law,
and
that
is
a
legal
point.
but
this
court
in
the
validity
area,
for
example,
has
made
it
clear
that
the
way
you
look
to
see
that
something
is
factual
when
you're
looking
at
determinations
based
upon
weighing
evidence,
persuasiveness,
and
credibility,
those
are
factual
issues.
and
in
the
validity
context,
the
ultimate
question
of
validity
is
a
question
of
law,
but
nonetheless,
the
underlying
factual
issues
like
the
state
of
the
art
that
go
to
the
determination
of
non-obviousness
are
submitted
to
the
jury
or
the
fact
finder.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
well,
reported
cases
that
we
rely
upon
are
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
if
i
count
them--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--i
can't
just--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--novelty
issue,
some
whether
there
was
an
adequate
disclosure
so
that
one
skilled
in
the
art
could
make
the
machine.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
quickly
then.
the
majority
decided
only
the
general
issue.
that's
the
reason
mr.
markman
lost
his
infringement
verdict.
the
court
never
reached
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
point.
it's
not
up.
there
are
all
kinds
of
validity
issues
where
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
is
clear
that
the
underlying
facts
go
to
the
jury.
and
i
don't
have
time
to
rattle
them
off,
but
it
seems
to
me
completely
inconsistent
with
that
that
we
would
pick
out
this
one
term
analysis
which
is
very
much
the
same
and
say
it
doesn't
go
to
the
jury.
and
when
you're
dealing
with
credibility,
it's
artificial
to
say
that
you're
not
finding
facts.
there
have
been
markman
trials,
so-called,
after
majority
opinion.
we
cite
some
of
them
in
our
brief
where
they
talk
about
the
professor,
how
much
he's
getting
paid,
how
much
he's
getting
in
royalties
for
himself,
all
the
typical
things
about
whether
he's
to
be
believed
or
not,
and
what
those
judges
say
about
whether
they're
deciding
credibility
and
whether
the
witness
is
believable
or
not.
and
as
judge
mayer
pointed
out
before,
when
you
decide
the
meaning
of
the
term
in
an
infringement
case,
most
of
the
time
you've
decided
the
infringement.
the
jury
is
essentially
ejected
out
of
the
infringement
analysis
if
they
are
not
allowed
to
decide
genuine
issues
of
fact
regarding
the
meaning
of
the
term.
if
the
term
is
so
vague
that
the
patent
ought
to
be
invalid,
that's
another
question.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
it
would
be
held
invalid.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
that
still
could
be
the
case
but
it's
more
theoretical
than
real.
once
you
know
what
the
term
means...
there
is
the
accused
device
sitting
there...
you
know
whether
it's
common.
and
that's
all
that...
as
judges
on
the
federal
circuit--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--in
most
cases,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
there
is
very
little
left.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
there's
a
lot
more
left
in
a
contract
case,
your
honor,
but
it
isn't
the
same
thing
in
a
jury
case
where
the
term
analysis,
what
does
that
cover?
when
that's
determined,
what
is
a
genuine
issue
of
fact,
by
the
judge,
there's
really
nothing
significant
left
for
the
jury,
as
judge
mayer
pointed
out.
