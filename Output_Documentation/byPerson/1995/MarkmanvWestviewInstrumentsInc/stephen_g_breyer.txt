justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
had
a
little
trouble
finding
that
confirmation
that
you
seem
to
have
found.
i
mean,
judge
hand's
opinion
seemed
ambiguous
and
it
also
certainly
says
that
in
the
part
that
favors
you,
that
it's
a
question
of
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
where
does
that
get
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
no
doubt
about
that,
but
where
does...
the
question
of
how
people
in
a
particular
industry
see
a
particular
word
and
interpret
it
is
a
linguistic
question.
it
is
a
factual
question
as
to
how
they
interpret
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
where
does
that
get
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
things...
we
just
heard
a
case
where
there
were
all
kinds
of
facts
which
judges
decide.
there
are
many,
many
facts
that
judges
decide.
we
write
about
segregation.
we
write
about
integration.
we
write
about
gerrymandering.
we
write
about
dozens
and
dozens
of
things.
we
write
about
antitrust
laws
which
have
to
do
with
theories
of
economics.
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
facts
that
judges
decide
in
interpreting
statutes
and
rules
of
evidence
in
preliminary
matters.
why
is
this
the
kind
of
question
of
fact
that
the
seventh
amendment
requires
to
go
to
a
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the...
fine.
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
discuss
this
because
i
read
many
of
those,
not
all
of
the
cases,
and
i
couldn't
find
something
that
was
directly
on
point,
not
even
learned
hand,
because
the
earlier
part
of
the
opinion
you're
thinking
of
seems
to
go
just
the
other
way
and
the
part
that
you're
thinking
of
seemed
to
have
involved
a
factual
matter
that
had
to
do
with
the
word
saturation,
which
they
agreed
about
the
meaning
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that's
the
conclusion.
i'm
saying
what
would
you
say
is
the
strongest
case
in
your
favor
in
respect
to
the
factual
question
as
to
how
the
industry
understands
the
meaning
of
a
term
in
a
patent
application,
a
term
that
will
give
the
person
who
holds
it
a
monopoly
under
the
law
to
exclude
competitors.
now,
that's
the
precise
thing.
what
your
opponents
say
is
there
is
nothing
that
favors
you
on
that
precise
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
the
reason...
i
don't
find
them
determinative
yet.
that
is
to
say,
if
they're
not
determinative,
then...
and
i'm
assuming
they're
not...
what
is
the
right
analogy?
there
are
so
many
instances
where
judges
do
take
evidence,
where
they
do
decide
factual
matters
which
don't
have
to
go
to
a
jury,
and
that's
why
i'm
looking
for
the
analogy.
what
about
agency
rules
where
technical
terms
are
used,
where
what
you
want,
if
you're
a
judge
reviewing
that
agency
rule,
is
you
want
to
know
what
the
agency
really
had
in
mind?
you
might
want
to
refer
to
the
industry.
it
might
come
in
in
a
tort
case,
for
example,
you
see,
a
jury
case,
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
you
had
to
leave
up
to
the
jury
the
determination
of
interpreting
the
agency
rule
that
used
a
technical
term.
i
mean,
maybe
it's
such
a
good
analogy
that
it
has
never
come
up
and
therefore
it's
a
bad
analogy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
do
you
see--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--here
you
have
your
jury
and
the
agency
is
up
there
talking
about
dioxin,
so4,
ishkabibble,
whatever,
something
very,
very
hard
to
understand,
and
the
agency
interpretation
is
relevant.
and
the
parties
say
to
the
judge,
judge,
will
you
instruct
the
jury
as
to
what
that
agency
rule
means?
i
don't
think
you'd
have
to
have
the
jury
decide
it
even
though
you
might
take
evidence
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
a
tort
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
think
they'd
ever
say
that
the
jury
has
to
decide
the
meaning
of
a
statute,
and
by
that
i
would
say
the
jury
would
never
have
to
decide
the
meaning
of
an
agency
rule
even
though
it
could
use
technical
terms
on
which
experts
could
differ.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
agency
rules.
and
now
what
about
patents?
where
it
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that...
suppose
i
thought
this
hypothetically.
this
is...
do
you
remember
the
learned
hand
case?
are
you
pretty
familiar
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
at
the
end
of...
suppose
i
thought
this.
in
the
end
of
the
opinion,
they're
talking
about
the
word
saturation,
and
they
say
it
means
that
after
a
certain
point
there
won't
be
a
lot
of
variation
in
electrons.
then
the
question
is,
what's
that
point?
and
they
call
in
some
experts,
and
they
say
plus
or
minus
6
percent.
that's
a
question
of
fact?
he
says,
that's
right.
at
the
beginning
of
the
opinion,
he's
talking
about
the
length
of
a
beam.
do
the
words
in
this
document
mean
you
have
a
long
beam,
or
does
it
mean
long
in
relation
to
the
width?
now,
he
says
there,
assuming
experts
would
say
it
meant
the
latter,
i
still
think
it
means
the
former.
you
see?
suppose
you
thought,
as
a
result
of
that,
sometimes
you
should
send
it
to
a
jury
and
sometimes
you
shouldn't,
and
let's
leave
it
up
to
the
judges
to
decide
because
they
understand
electron
saturation
and
things
50
times
better
than
i
do
after
they
have
heard
4
days
of
testimony
on
it.
suppose
that
was
your
belief
of
what
the
law
should
be.
now,
how
would
you
get
there
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
circuit
seems
to
say
it's
never
a
question
for
the
jury.
it's
always
a
question
for
the
judge.
so,
if
you
thought
sometimes
it
should
be
the
one,
sometimes
it
should
be
the
other,
and
the
district...
how
would
you
get
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
the
seventh...
i
mean,
if
you
go
back
to
the
english
practice,
my
impression
in
reading
this...
but
you
know
it
better
and
will
correct
me...
is
that
questions
like
originality
or
non-obviousness,
et
cetera,
were
quite
close
if
they
weren't
directly
the
kinds
of
things
that
they
did
leave
to
a
jury.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
so,
then
the
question
would
be
if
that's
so,
then
they
have
to
be
left
to
a
jury
i
guess
for
present
purposes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
it
the
case
that
for
you
to
win
this
case,
we
also
have
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
originality,
et
cetera,
or
non-obviousness
is
for
a
judge
or
a
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
do
you
distinguish
it
from
all
those
other
issues
which
probably
were
sent
to
the
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
we'd
like
to
find
is
someone
who
once
went
to
an
english
judge
in
1780
and
said,
judge,
you're
supposed
to
decide
whether
this
document
before
you
is
non-obvious.
to
do
that,
you
have
to
know
two
things:
what
the
document
means
and
what
the
future
world
was
like...
previous
world
was
like.
the
second
part
is
factual.
the
first
part
is
purely
legal.
judge,
instruct
the
jury
as
to
that
first
part.
no
one
ever
said
that.
