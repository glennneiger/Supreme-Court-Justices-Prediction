suppose
that
a
statute
used
the
word
inventory,
say,
in
an
income
tax
refund
case
tried
before
a
jury.
would
the
meaning
of
the
term
inventory
in
the
statute
be
for
the
court,
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
do
you
think
it's
an
appropriate
way
for
us
to
begin
looking
at
this
case
to
ask
whether
or
not
the
patent
is
more
like
a
statute
or
a
contract?
that's
what
the
briefs
discussed.
do
you
think
that's
an
appropriate
way
for
us
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--look
at
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
find
that...
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
how
persuasive
and
clear
that
direct
authority
is,
then
do
you
think
that
we
can
legitimately
decide
this
case
by
asking
whether
or
not
the
patent
is
more
like
a
contract
on
one
hand
or
a
statute
on
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
more
like
a
statute
than
a
contract
in
this
respect.
there
is
an
interest.
maybe
you'll
disagree,
but
i
should
think
there
is
an
interest
in
a
uniform
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
a
particular
patent,
just
as
there
is
with
a
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
interpretation
of
the
patent
is
a
question
for
the
court,
a
question
of
law,
or
at
least
a
question
of
interpretation
makes
a
question
of
law
in
fact...
there
may
be
even
evidence
on
the
point...
that
it's
a
question
properly
reserved
to
the
court
in
order
to
have
uniformity
in
its
interpretation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
important
to
have
uniformity
in
the
patent,
the
construction
of
a
particular
patent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
other
cases
are
there
in
which
you
have
experts
with
conflicting
opinions
called
by
both
parties
where
the
judge
makes
the
decision?
the
case
is
a
difficult
one
because
we're
searching
for
analogies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
malpractice
case,
i
think
we
all
would
agree
that
it
goes
to
the
jury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
if
you
were
to
prevail,
then
in
the
patent
area
we
would
have
more
expert
testimony
being
considered
by
the
judge
than
in
any
other
case
that
we
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
some
idea
of
how
often
conflicting
expert
testimony
is
presented
in
a
patent
case
on
the
issue
of
the
meaning
of
the
patent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
would
have
thought.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
that
consistent
with
the
seventh
amendment?
how
does
the
seventh...
i
think
justice
kennedy
and
i
are
asking
the
same--
