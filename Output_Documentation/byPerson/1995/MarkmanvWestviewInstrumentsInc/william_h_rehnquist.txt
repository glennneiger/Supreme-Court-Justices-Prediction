we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
95-26,
herbert
markman
and
positek
v.
westview
instruments,
inc.--
mr.
mallin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
words
did
you
say
they
ended
with?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
words
did
you
say
that
they
ended
with?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
this...
the
word
inventory
appeared
in
a
contract
and
there
was
no
evidence
aliunde,
as
they
say,
no
evidence
of
intent,
do
you
think
that
a
judge
could
interpret
that
as
a...
without
submitting
it
to
the
jury
even
though
it
was
quite
debatable
on
either
side
as
to
what
it
meant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
then
if
you
have
a
contract
that
uses
the
word
inventory
and
there's
no
testimony
as
to
what
people
meant,
it's
simply
a
documented,
written
kind
of...
that
is
a
factual
question
that
would
go
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay.
supposing
that
i
am...
that
we
have
this
contract
with
the
word
inventory
in
it
and
someone
comes
in
and
says,
i
offer
x
who
will
testify
what
the
parties
meant
when
they
used
the
word
inventory
in
the
contract.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ordinarily
i
understood
the
law
to
be
that
the
terms
of
a
written
contract
are
interpreted
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
isn't
a
question
of
fact.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that's
a
tort
action.
you're
not
talking
about
some
sort
of
a
relatively
integrated
written
instrument
which
i
think
in
different
branches
of
the
law
has
been
treated
differently
than
just
ordinary
oral
testimony.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mallin.
mr.
griffin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
have
to
decide
this
case
on
as
global
a
basis
as
the
federal
circuit
decided
to
say
that
it's
always
thus
or
it's
never
thus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
ever
hear
evidence
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
couldn't
a
fairly
narrow
instruction
be
submitted
to
the
jury
as
to
which
of
the...
if
there
are
two
experts,
as
to
which
of
the
two
experts
you
credit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
in
a
particular
case
it
is.
supposing
the
judge
says
to
himself,
i
know
both
these
experts
are
qualified,
but
i
think
b
is
making
up
his
story.
had
it
been
submitted
to
the
jury,
it
would
have
been
just
the
opposite;
the
jury
thought
a
was
making
up
his
story.
now,
why
should
the
judge's
view
prevail
over
the
jury
on
a
question
of
credibility
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
they
say
figures
don't
lie,
but
liars
do
figure,
and
occasionally
you
do
get
experts
whose
credibility
may
be
in
doubt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
a
question
like
that
go
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
shouldn't
it
be
a
question
of
credibility
of
in-court
testimony
if
the
finder
of
fact,
whether
it's
a
judge
or
a
jury,
decides
that
one
of
the
experts
is
simply
lying?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
see
this
as
simply
taken
out
of
the
normal
factual
review
by
a
jury.
it's
the
same
sort
of
issue
as
foreign
law
or
jurisdiction,
diversity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
sounds
like
a
very
strange
interpretation
of
the
seventh
amendment
to
me.
are
you
saying
that
congress
could
not
confide
more
things
to
the
jury
as
opposed
to
the
judge
than
was
done
at
common
law
in
1791?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
griffin.
mr.
mallin,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mallin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-26,
markman
versus
westview
instruments
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
