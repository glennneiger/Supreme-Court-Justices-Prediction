well,
some
of
the
dissenters
in
this
very
case
thought
that
was
the
situation
here,
didn't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wasn't
there
one
or
more
dissents
written
or
separate
opinions
written
at
the
appellate
court
level?
maybe
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
here
the
question
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
question
is
whether
the
inventory
referred
to
the
articles
of
clothing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
boils
down
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
under
a
patent
scheme
where
the
applicant
for
a
patent
has
to
set
forth
very
clearly
what's
covered
and
how
it
can
be
made
so
that
everyone
is
put
on
notice
of
what
is
patented
and
what
is
claimed
and
how
it
can
be
produced.
and
i
would
think
the
patent
office
wouldn't
want
to
accept
something
about
which
there
might
be
wildly
different
views
of
what's
claimed.
i
mean,
the
whole
scheme
seems
to
me
one
that
is
designed
to
make
it
as
clear
and
simple
as
possible
to
put
people
on
notice,
and
what
you
are
arguing
seems
to
be
at
some
divergence
of
that
approach.
would
there
be
many
cases
today
where
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
a
term
in
the
patent
would
have
to
go
to
a
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
seems
like
most
of
the
cases
you
rely
on
resulted
in
some
kind
of
general
verdict
where
the
patent
ends
up
having
to
be
compared
to
something
quite
different,
and
it's
hard
to
tell
from
those
cases
whether
there's
this
separate
factual
issue
on
the
meaning--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
patent
construction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
question
of
foreign
law
which,
as
i
understand
it,
judges
decide
as
an
issue
of
law
even
though
they
hear
expert
testimony
from
those
skilled
in
what
the
foreign
law
might
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
don't
submit
that
to
the
jury,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
never
did--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--submit
it
to
the
jury,
did
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
proved
as
a
fact.
it's
just
that
oral
testimony
is
heard.
experts
say
what
they
think
the
foreign
law
means.
it
doesn't
change...
the
fact
that
there's
evidence,
that
there's
testimony
doesn't
determine
whether
something
is
a
question
of
fact
or
law.
