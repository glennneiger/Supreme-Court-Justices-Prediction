how
many
english
cases
do
you
have
supporting
this?
because,
you
know,
i'm
a
little
skeptical
of
the
certainty,
or
perhaps
indeed
even
the
existence,
of
the
english
law.
as
you
know,
one
of
the
amicus
says
from
1750
to
1791...
99,
there
were
only
18
patent
decisions
at
common
law
in
england.
there
was
no
coherent
body
of
english
patent
law
to
be
known
by
the
enactors
of
the
seventh
amendment.
how
many
english
cases
do
you
rely
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
six.
and
how
many
of
them
involve
the
definiteness
issue
rather
than
the
nature
of
the
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
them
anyway.
some
of
them
anyway,
maybe
most
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
griffin,
i
was
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that,
you
know,
there
were
really
significant...
didn't
you
say
earlier
if
there
were
a
significant
credibility
problem,
it
would
go
to
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
so...
but
were
that
the
case,
you'd
be
willing
to
entertain
the
notion
that
a
jury
would
decide
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
your
position,
and
i
thought
one
of
the
reasons
you
said
it
has
to
be
left
to
the
judge
is
that
if
you
leave
it
to
a
jury,
you
can
get
divergent
results
as
to
the
meaning
of
one
patent
all
around
the
country
and
no
court
would
be
able
to
reverse
it
because
it
could
be
a
reasonable
determination
either
way,
and
so
you
would
have
to
affirm
the
jury
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
have
a
patent
that
has
different
meanings
throughout
the
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
if
the
judge
decides
it,
ultimately
if
it's
a
question
of
law
for
the
judge,
it
can
be
established
as
the
rule
nationwide.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
is
a
very
important
factor
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
surely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--surely
there's
a
separate
issue
of
whether
there
has
been
an
infringement
or
not.
i
mean,
there's
not
just
the
definition
of
the
patent.
there's
also
whether
the
competing
instrument
was
an
infringement.
that's
still
left
entirely
to
the
jury,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
a
big
question.
it
seems
to
me
a
big
question,
indeed.
i
don't
think
there's
nothing
left
for
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
like
saying
the
contracts
case
is
over
once
the
court
tells
the
jury
what
the
contract
means,
and
thereafter
there's
nothing
left.
of
course,
there's
plenty
left.
the
jury
has
to
decide
whether
the
contract
was
complied
with
or
not.
