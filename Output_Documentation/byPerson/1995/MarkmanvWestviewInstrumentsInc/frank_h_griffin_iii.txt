mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
contrary
to
the
petitioners'
position,
seventh
amendment
policy,
precedent,
and
reason
support
the
conclusion
which
was
reached
by
the
federal
circuit
in
this
case
that
in
a
patent
infringement
action
tried
to
a
jury,
it
is
the
province
of
the
court
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
words
used
in
the
claim
language
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
in
this
case
there
was
no
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
language
in
the
patent...
no
real
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
language
used
in
the
patent.
and
that
was
the
conclusion
by
the
trial
judge,
by
the
eight
judges
writing
in
the
majority,
by
the
two
judges
concurring,
and
judge
newman
who
dissented
did
not
disagree
with
the
interpretation
of
the
patent.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
no,
you
don't
because
i
think
it
is
taking
it...
looking
at
the
interpretation
of
the
claim.
one
here
could
conclude
that
there
was
just
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
jury
verdict
below,
but
if
you
go--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--i
don't--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
that's
the
global
position.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
i'm
not
completely
familiar
with
it,
but
i
understand
it.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
if
that
were
my
belief
as
to
what
the
law
would
be,
i
would
get
there
in
this
case
by
exactly
the
same
route
that
the
district
judge
did
here.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
it's
difficult
for
me
to
consider
because
i...
that's
not
my
view
of
what
the
law
is
or
ought
to
be,
and
it's
a
tough
question
for
me
to
stand
here
and
come
up
with
an
answer
for
you
because
i
think
that
under
this
court's
decisions
and
under
a
proper
seventh
amendment
analysis,
this
issue
of
what
is
the
meaning
of
words,
what's
the
definition
of
a
term
is
a
question
of
law
for
the
court.
and
it
is
in
all
instances,
even
when
the
court
has
to
go
outside
of
the
patent
documents
to
get
information
about
the
meaning
of
the
term.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
that's
what
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
i
did
not
see
anything
in
between
either,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
in
none,
and
it
would
appear
that
the
concurring
judges
would
in
some
instances.
it's
very
difficult
to
say.
when
i...
when
the
case
was
before
the
federal
circuit,
one
of
the
issues
and
one
of
the
questions
was,
can
you
think
of
any
time
when
there
would
be
an
underlying
fact
issue
which
would
be
appropriate
to
go
to
the
jury?
and
i
could
not
think
of
one.
and
as...
and
i
tried
to
think
of
one
today
and
i
can't
think
of
one
because
a
patent
is
a...
a
patent
claim
is
by
statute
required
to
be
definite.
the
patent
claim
is
in
context
of
the
specification
and
the
prosecution
history.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
because
sometimes,
your
honor,
the
court
needs
to
go
outside
of
those
documents
to
learn
about
the
meaning
of
terms.
but
when
the
court
does
that,
it's
hearing
that
information
in
the
context
of
what
the
claim
says
and
in
the
context
of
the
specification
and
the
prosecution
history,
and
it
is
learning
yet
how
the
words
are
used.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
i
don't
think
it
should
get
down
to
that,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
does
get
down
to
that
because
the
question
isn't
one
which
is
a
typical
issue
of
credibility
of
experts
on
the
stand.
it's
not
a
question
where
you're
judging--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--if
there
were
such
an
instance,
that
would
be
a
difficult
question,
sir,
but
i
don't
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
meaning
of
the
term
within
the
context
of
the
patent,
the
claim,
the
prosecution
history,
and
the
information
that's
received,
that
you
will
get
to
a
point
where
credibility
determinations
are
going
to
be
what
a
word
means
to
a
specific--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--i
think
that
that
is
something
that
happens
quite
often.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
because
the
issue
is
not...
is
one
which
is
peculiarly
for
the
judge.
it's
not
going
to
be
an
issue
of
credibility
as
far
as
the
in-court
testimony
goes.
it's
going
to
be
the
question
of
the
logic
of
the
testimony
and
the
information--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--that
would
be
the
same
instance
in
a
question
of
foreign
law,
sir,
if
there
was
one
expert
who
was
telling
the
court
that
the
law
of
france
meant
one
thing
and
another
saying
it
meant
the
other.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
i
said...
i
was
asked
to
assume
that
there
might
be.
i
cannot
believe
that
there
can
be
a
situation,
your
honor,
when
there
can
be
a
significant...
in
defining
the
terms
used
in
a
patent
claim,
as
they
are
framed
within
the
patent
claim
itself,
illuminated
by
the
specification,
illustrated
by
the
prosecution
history,
that
credibility
determinations
among
experts
are
going
to
determine
what
a
term
means
to
a
relatively
skilled
community.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
no.
i
don't
think
it
was
necessary
for
a
jury
to
decide
that.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
well,
you
would
end
up
with
a
patent--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--be
established
as
a
rule
and
would
be
reviewed
de
novo,
and
that
is--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--that
is
a
policy
reason...
very
much,
sir.
it's
a
policy
reason
why
this
ought
to
be
a
matter
of
law
for
the
court.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
well,
the
best--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--the
best
analogies
that
i
can
think
of...
and
i
don't
believe
that
analogies
really
control
in
seventh
amendment
analysis,
justice.
the
best
analogies
i
can
think
of
are
foreign
law--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
can
also
think
of
determination
of
the
meaning
of
agency
regulations,
which
was
referred
to
earlier--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--that
is,
justice,
if
those
who
draft
patents
don't
comply
with
the
requirements
of
section
112
to
make
them
definite
and
to
define
the
terms
which
they
use.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
i
cannot
from
my
own
experience,
although
i
can
tell
you
from
the
suggestions
that
have
been
made
by
the
petitioner
that
it
is
an
issue
in
virtually
every
case.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
the--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--well,
it
should
be
an
issue--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
should
be
an
issue.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
we
argue
that
the
distinction
between
patents
and
contracts
is
that
the
patent
document
is
required
by
statute
to
be
definite.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
it's
supposed
to.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
the
real
world
question
of
how
do
you
determine
what
they
mean
when
you
can't
figure
it
out
is
exactly
what
the
patent
statute
is
supposed
to
guard
against,
which
is
that
it
should
be
a
definite
claim,
that
it
should
be
concise,
that
it
should
enable
one
skilled
in
the
art
to
understand
the
metes
and
bounds
of
the
invention
so
the
public
can
stay
away
from
that
monopoly
if
the
public
chooses
or
the
public
can
license
that--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--because
a
contract...
with
contract,
the
question
is
the
subjective
intent
of
the
parties,
and
with
a
patent
document,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
question
of
subjective
intent.
we're
dealing
with
the
objective--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--not
as
far
as
the
public
is
concerned.
the
public
has--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--yes.
if
it
becomes
a
question
of
definiteness,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
a
question
of
law
for
the
court.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
i
think
that
is
a
result
of
patent
practice,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
don't
think
it
should
be
the
practice.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
if
i
can
recall
the
question
of...
non-obviousness
i
believe
is
a
question...
my
mind
is...
i
don't
know
the
answers.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
if
we
got
to
a
question
of
what
is
the
patent
anticipated
by
prior
art,
that
would
be
a
question
of
fact.
if...
there
are
questions
of
fact
where
what
the
focus
is--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--the
issue
would
be
what
does
the
patent
claim
mean,
and
then
with
the
other
evidence
of
obviousness
it
becomes
a
question
then
of
what...
would
it
have
been
obvious
to
one
skilled
in
the
art.
what
the
federal
circuit
did
in
this
case
was--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
if
the
only
argument
is
the
uniformity
argument,
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
well,
enablement
i
believe
today
is
treated
as
a
question
of
law.
it
was
at
common
law
treated
as
a
question
of
fact.
so,
i
think--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--i
believe
that
that
is
the
holding
of
the
cases,
and
i
don't
have
them
with
me--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--that
would
get
me
back
to
the...
the
seventh
amendment
analysis
here,
that
is...
is
one
of
whether...
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
this
is
a
case
which
is
tried
to
a
jury,
and
so
this
court's
historic
analysis
and
the
cases,
the
so-called
law
equity
cases,
that
the
court
has
dealt
with
in
determining
whether
a
jury
trial
itself
is
applicable
is
not
necessarily
determinative
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
jury
trial
of
what
issues
will
be
eventually
given
to
the
jury
and
what
issues
will
be
reserved
for
the
judge.
it
is
an
indication
of
how
one
might
project
things,
but
it
does
not
fix...
this
court's
precedent
does
not
fix
in
time
in
19...
1791
all
of
the
incidents
of
the
jury
trial.
the
seventh
amendment
requires
that
you
preserve
the
essentials
of
it,
which
is
that
the
jury
decide
those
things
which
will
be
characterized
as
fact
and
that
the...
also
preserves
the
role
of
the
judge
to
decide
those
things
which
are
characterized
as
law
and--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--congress
could
and
congress
in
the
patent
setting
could
enact
a
statute
which
says
that
the...
all
questions
of
patent
infringement
or
validity
are
to
be
tried
by
an
article
i
court
and
that
would
not
violate
the
seventh
amendment.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
no.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
because
the
issue
that's
presented
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
whether
the
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
used
in
the
patent
claim--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--is
appropriately--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--because,
well,
in
the
first
instance
the
juries
in
common
law
england
were
not
asked
to
interpret
the
words
of
a
patent,
and
that
was
for
practical
reasons
as
well
as
legal
reasons.
juries
in
common
law
england
were
often
illiterate.
the
courts
reserved
to
themselves
the
interpretation
of
the
written
word.
what
juries
were
asked
to
do
in
common
law
england,
to
the
extent
that
you
can
discern
it
from
the
few
cases
that
there
are,
is
to
decide
whether
this
specification
was
the
appropriate
recipe
for
how
you
made
this
particular
type
of
stuff
up
or
whether
it
was
able
to
teach
somebody
how
to
make
the
widget,
whatever
it
may
be.
and
the
testimony
which
was
heard
was
not
of
anyone
other
than
the
artisan
coming
in
and
said
i
followed
the
recipe.
i
did--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--i
did
not
see
anything
like
that.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
no.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
valid
concern
because
the
federal
circuit
has
taught
us
that
there
are
a
number
of
issues
that
are
to
be
left
to
the
jury.
but
what
it
does
raise
the
ultimate
question,
which
isn't
in
this
case,
is
whether
there
is
a
seventh
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
patent
case,
and
that's
the
other
issue
and
that's
not
here.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
that's
correct.
and
as
long
as
congress
has
provided
that
patent
infringement
actions
for
damages
are
to
be
tried
to
a
jury
and
the
statute
provides
for
that,
there
is
a
role
for
the
jury
in
patent
cases
from
the
determination
of
issues
of
damages,
as
the
hilton
davis
case
says
in
the
question
of
equivalence.
there
are
a
number
of
issues
which
are
appropriate
for
the
jury.
and
especially
the
jury
deals
with
the
ultimate
question
of
infringement.
does
the
accused
device
invade
the
metes
and
bounds
of
the
patent?
that
is
the
jury's
ultimate
job.
it's
the
court's
job
to
tell
the
jury
what
the
patent
means,
and
this
court
has
said
that
on
numerous
occasions.
it's
the
court's
job
to
tell
the
jury
what
the
patent
means
and
in
the
infringement
case
it's
the
job
of
the
jury
to
find
out
whether
that
accused
devise
invades
that
monopoly,
whether
the
patent
reads
on
the
accused
device.
that
is...
that's
the
essence
and
that's
the
jury
trial
which
we
are
entitled
to
in
patent
cases.
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
no.
i
think
it's
a
very
weak
analogy,
justice,
in
my--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--i
think
it
is
a
weak
analogy
because
the
question
of
what
a
specific
term
used
in
a
contract
to
the
requisite
community
which
is
skilled
in
that
is
something
which
does
not
exist
except
for
the
patent
documents
themselves
which
frame
the--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--and
it
frames
the
inquiry.
and
when
you
are
hearing
outside
the
patent
documents
from
somebody,
you
have
the
documents
themselves
which
are
written
in
an
objectively
directed
fashion
to
judge
what
that
meaning
is.
the
parties
can
mean
anything
that
they
wish
with
their
contracts
as
between
only
two
sides,
and
the
question
of
the
subjective
intent
of
the
parties
in
a
contract
only
gets
decided
by
the
jury
in
many
jurisdictions
if
the
judge
concludes
initially,
after
reviewing
the
contract,
that
he's
not
going
to
interpret
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
or
she's
not
going
to
interpret
it
as
a
matter
of
law--
mr.
frank
h.
griffin,
iii
--from
the
four
corners.
