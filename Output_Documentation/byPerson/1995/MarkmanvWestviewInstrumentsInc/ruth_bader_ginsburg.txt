justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
mallin,
you
agree
i
think
that
the
scope
of
the
claim,
the
construction
of
the
claim
is
a
question
of
law
for
the
court,
but
you
are
distinguishing
interpretation
of
a
term
from
the
ultimate
question.
well,
why
don't
those
two
go
together?
that
is,
if
the
court
is
charged
with
making
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
scope
of
what's
encompassed
within
the
claim,
then
why
shouldn't
subsidiary
matters
on
the
way
to
that
ultimate
determination
also
be
made
by
the
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.
mallin,
i'm
thinking
of
this
kind
of
question.
you
were
careful
to
say
on
the
merits,
if
it's
a
question
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
threshold
questions,
for
example,
jurisdictional
questions
like
diversity
of
citizenship...
there's
a
dispute
about
where
one
of
the
parties
resides...
that's...
and
it's
a
fact
question.
it's
a
fact
question.
but
the
question
of
is
the
jurisdictional
requirement
met
is
a
question
for
the
court,
and
so
we
don't
have
the
jury
hearing
the
evidence.
there
may
well
be
evidence
on
that
question,
but
it's
determined
by
the
court,
right,
even
though
it's
a
fact
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
it
be
a
legal
question
if
you
didn't
have
any
testimony,
if
all
you
had
was
the
claim,
the
specification,
and
the
prosecution
history?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
judge
looks
at
that
material
and
says
i
can
see
that
there's
an
argument
the
other
way,
but
this
is
enough
for
me.
i
think
that
the
term
means
x
based
on
the
documentary
evidence,
and
i
don't
want
to
hear...
i
know
the
parties
are
going
get...
each
one
will
get
an
expert
and
that's
not
going
to
help
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
analogy
in
one
of
the
briefs
to
patents
for
land
and
also
scope
of
copyright?
this
is
in
the
surgical
corporation
brief.
it
gave
those
two
analogies
as
being
perhaps
closer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
griffin,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
division
in
the
federal
circuit...
they
took
this
case
en
banc
because
they
were
internally
divided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
took
the
position
that
it's
always
for
the
jury,
and
one
took
the
position
that
it's
always
for
the
court.
but
i
didn't
see
in
the
division
within
the
circuit
anything
in
between.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
discretion
left
to
the
district
judge.
at
least
of
the
division
within
the
federal
circuit
panels,
judge
newman
would
leave
it
to
the
jury
in
all
cases
and
judge
archer,
chief
judge
archer,
in
none.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
often
can
turn
on
credibility
because
the
judge
may
not
be
able
to
read
the
language
of
the
law.
so,
he
is
informed
by
what
each
expert
says
and
may
make
the
judgment
on
the
basis
of
demeanor,
but
that
doesn't
change
the
issue
from
one
of
law
to
one
of
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
because
it's
the
pto's
job
before
it
accepts
the
statement?
at
least
you
have
a
government
officer
whose
job
it
is
to
see
that
the
claim
is
as
definite
as
it's
supposed
to
be.
now,
that
government
officer
can
err
and,
as
you
said,
often
does
because
you
said
this
question
comes
up
in
almost
every
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
distinguish
the
questions
of
non-obviousness,
enablement?
are
those
also
questions
for
the
court
rather
than
for
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
that's...
one
of
the
concerns
is
if
you
could
narrow
what
the
federal
circuit
has
done
to
the
question
of
how
do
you
read
a
term
of
the
fact...
of
the
claim
when
the
overall
scope
of
the
claim
is
for
the
court,
that's
one
thing.
it
perhaps
could
be
isolated,
but
then
there
are
other
questions
of
a
similar
nature,
are
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
question
is
what
does
the
term
mean
to
someone
ordinarily
skilled
in
the
art,
okay,
why
shouldn't
the
obviousness
question
go
the
same
way?
would
this
invention
be
non-obvious
to
a
person
ordinarily
skilled?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
can
you
distinguish
this
question
of
what
does
the
term
in
the
claim
mean
from
non-obviousness
as
one?
another
one
is
enablement.
could
a
person
skilled
in
the
art
look
at
this
patent
and
build
a
machine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
precedent
that
tells
us
that
today
it's
treated
as
a
question
of
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
give
a
sensible
reason
why
you
would
put
these
things
on
different
sides
of
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
that
a
major
concern
here
that
you've
got
something
that
is
an
action
at
law?
a
patent
infringement
is
an
action
at
law.
and
then
you're
going
to
take
the
issues
one
by
one
and
take
them
away
from
the
jury,
and
pretty
soon
you'll
have
nothing
triable
to
a
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
at
least
everybody
in
the
federal
circuit
agreed
that
there
is.
now,
if
congress
wants
to
concoct
some
entirely
other
regime
like
it
can
make
what
were
once
tort
cases
into
workers'
compensation
cases,
that's
one
thing.
