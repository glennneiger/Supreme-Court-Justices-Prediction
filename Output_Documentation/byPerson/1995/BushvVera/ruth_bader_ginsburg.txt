mr.
aguilar,
before
you
do
that,
remind
me...
i
think
you
mentioned
it
just
a
moment
ago.
didn't
this
court
not
credit
incumbency
on
the
same
line
as
the
traditional
factors
that
were
mentioned
in
the
shaw
opinion?
as
you
pointed
out,
miller
had
not
yet
been
decided,
and
i...
can
you
be
precise
about
how
this
court
treated
incumbency?
did
it
consider
it
a
traditional
districting
factor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
in
this
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
it
treat
it
as
something
that
could
dominate?
my
question
is,
did
the
court
recognize
that
incumbency
should
be
treated
as
a
legitimate
factor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
hair--
--did
it
say--
--justice
kennedy
asked
a
question
earlier,
and
he
said,
if
one
would
concede
that
incumbency
protection
is
a
legitimate
traditional
factor,
still,
how
can
you
justify
giving
effect
to
incumbency
by
using
race?
i
think
that
was
his
question,
and
i'd
like
to
get
your
response
to
that.
the
position
is,
you
got
this
strange
shape
because
in
satisfying
the
incumbents'
desire
to
protect
their
turf,
you
used
race.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is.
of
course
it
is.
just
in
saying,
we
are
going
to
create
three
minority
majority
districts,
race
is
what
we
are
after.
we
want
three
racially
determined
districts.
we
are
willing
to
give
up
the
incumbency
and
everything
else.
we're
willing
to
subordinate
everything
to
race,
and
we
will
have
a
nice
compact
district.
race
is
so
important
that
we'll
subordinate
everything
to
it,
and
it
will
look
just
fine.
that's
okay
under
your
analysis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wasn't
that
in
effect...
texas
is
candid.
it
says,
we
have
a
census.
we
have
additional
seats.
we
want
three
minority
majority...
majority
minority
districts.
that's
our
objective,
and
we're
not
going
to
disguise
it
and
say,
compactness
was
our
objective,
but
we're
going
to
achieve
our
objective
consistent
with
compactness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
just
asking
you,
if
race
is
the
driving
factor--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
troy,
this
is
the
part
of
your
argument
that
i
have
great
difficulty
grasping.
if
race
were
used
alone
and
nothing
else,
that
would
have
been
all
right.
if
the
districts
had
been
created
so
that
they
would
be
majority
minority
districts,
and
then
the
white
incumbents
were
not
part
of
the
picture,
so
we
had
a
district
determined
solely
by
race
and
not
by
incumbency,
and
not
by
anything
else,
that
would
be
all
right.
but
once
you
intrude
something
that's
nonrace,
then
it's
unconstitutional.
that's
the
part
that
i
don't
understand,
the
logic
of
that,
but
you
conceded,
because
that
was
the
first
step
in
the
argument,
that
if...
that
the
state
has
a
goal,
wants
three
majority
minority
districts,
a
racial
goal,
that's
okay.
