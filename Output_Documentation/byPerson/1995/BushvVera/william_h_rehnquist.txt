we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94
805,
george
w.
bush
v.
al
vera,
william
lawson
v.
al
vera,
and
united
states
v.
al
vera.
mr.
aguilar.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
pretty
much
a
question
of
fact,
isn't
it,
mr.
aguilar,
whether
it
was
basically
a
desire
to
preserve
incumbency
or
whether
it
was
the
desire
to
create
majority
minority
districts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
mr.
aguilar,
you
made
this
argument,
i
take
it,
to
the
district
court,
and
you
can
see
it's
a
question
of
fact
as
to
what
the
motivation
for
drawing...
and
the
district
court
rejected
those
findings.
are
you
contending
here
that
they're
clearly
erroneous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
the
number
of
districts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
an
example
of
broad
tailoring,
then,
once
you
find
that
the...
you
want
to
draw
those
kinds
of...
are
there
any
kind
of
boundary
lines
you
can't
have?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
do
recognize
that
narrow
tailoring
would
outlaw
some
kinds
of
districts
drawn
after
a
decision
to
draw
majority
minority...
but
you
say
this
is
narrowly
tailored
in
your
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
aguilar.
mr.
bender,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
bender.
ms.
hair,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
district
that
justice
o'connor
hypothesized
were
drawn
the
same
way,
not
all
whites
but
just
enough
whites
to
guarantee
the
election
of
the
white
incumbent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
intentional
adjustment
of
just
the
right
amount
of
whites.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
never
held
that,
have
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
we've
never
held
that
the
voting
rights
act
is
a
basis
that
survives
strict
scrutiny,
i
don't
believe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hair.
mr.
troy,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
three
judges
of
the
district
court
were
all
texas
judges
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
go
ahead
and
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
look,
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
troy.
the
case
is
submitted.
