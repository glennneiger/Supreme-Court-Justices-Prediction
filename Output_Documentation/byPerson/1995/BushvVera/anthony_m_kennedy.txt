justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
i
want
you
to
get
to
section...
to
page
192,
but
let
me
ask
you
one
question
before
you
do
that.
if
incumbency
protection
is
the
motive,
but
the
means
used
to
effect
it
is
racial
gerrymandering,
is
that
constitutional?
does
that
comply
with
miller?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
i
say
i
want
to
protect
incumbents
and,
incidentally,
i
take
it
this
means
any
incumbent
who
is
an
officeholder
can
protect
his
or
her
interests
by
running
for
some
other
office.
a
state
senator
can
be
a
congressman,
and
that's
incumbency
protection
in
texas.
let's
assume
that
that
is
the
goal,
and
we
say,
in
order
to
do
this
we're
going
to
have
racial
gerrymanders.
does
this...
is
this
consistent
with
the
court's
holding
in
miller?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
that's
not
my
hypothetical.
my
hypothetical
is,
we
want
to
protect
incumbents,
and
the
way
we're
going
to
do
this,
the
principal
way,
the
principal
mechanism
we're
going
to
use
is
assigning
voters
to
districts
on
account...
by
race.
does
that
comport
with
the
command
of
miller?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
one
of
the
things
we're
going
to
ask.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
disagreed
with
that
characterization
of
what
happened,
would
we
have
to
find
that
there
was
an
illegality
that
occurred
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
all
right
to
get
black
voters
just
to
protect
incumbents.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
my
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
race
can
be
used
as
a
surrogate.
