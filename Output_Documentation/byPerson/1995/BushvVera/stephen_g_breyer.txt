justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if,
in
fact...
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
was
accepted
that
under
miller
you
could
use
race
as
a
basis
for
creating
a
section
2
required
district
of
the
voting
rights
act,
a
reasonably
compact
one.
suppose
you
also
thought
that
insofar
as
a
district
departs
from
a
compact
shape,
that's
okay
if
the
motive
for
the
departure
from
the
compact
shape
has
nothing
to
do
with
race,
such
as
protecting
incumbents.
if
you
thought
both
of
those
things,
then
would
you
have
to
remand
this
case
in
order
to
decide
if
the
reason
that
these
districts
depart
from
the
compact
shape
is
incumbency
protection?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--didn't
they
have
actual
computer
printouts
of
how
people
had
voted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
anyone
care
from
a
racial
point
of
view,
the
interest
being
to
elect
a
minority
congressman
or
woman?
that
can
be
achieved
with
a
compact
district,
so
why,
from
that
point
of
view,
would
anyone
care
whether
the
district
is
noncompact?
what
human
motive
could
there
be
for
these
irregular
shapes
other
than
incumbency
protection?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
clear
on
a
person
who
is
interested
in
having
a
black
congressman
or
a
black
congresswoman
would
be
interested,
i
assume,
many,
in
having
a
majority
minority
district
which
could
be
achieved
with
a
compact
district.
now,
given
that
fact,
what
possible
reason
could
a
person
who
has
that
interest
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
seeing
that
it's
an
odd
shape?
in
other
words,
what
would
the
reasoning
be?
i
can
understand
why
you
might
want
an
odd
shape
for
the
purpose
of
incumbency
protection,
but
i
don't
understand
what
the
reasoning
would
be
to
want
an
odd
shape
for
racial
reasons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
unless,
of
course,
you
think
a
lot
of
black
people
happen
to
be
democrats,
but
you
have
the
voting
record,
and
so
you
can
look
at
the
voting
records
and
not
worry
about
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
view,
if
it
were
proved...
i'm
not
saying
this
is
this
case,
but
if
it
were
proved
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
only
reason
that
the
districts
were
not
compact
in
shape
was
to
protect
incumbents,
and
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
race,
under
those
circumstances
would
these...
would
such
districts
be
constitutional,
even
under
miller?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
it
say
on
the...
there
must
have
been
a
computer
printout,
and
it
must
have
shown,
let's
say
block
by
block,
who
the
voters
are,
and
didn't
it
have
in
that
computer
printout,
or
whatever
they
were
looking
at,
the
registration
of
a
voter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
didn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
the
block
level...
at
the
level
of
each
block
they
had--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what's
the
smallest
level
that
they
had
political
party
affiliation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
precinct
level.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
in
your
view,
if
the
legislature
was
trying
to
create
a
district
to
comply
with
voting
right
act
section
2,
and
in
doing
that
they
used
race,
and
i
don't
know
how
else
they
would
do
it,
that
would
be
constitutional.
in
your
view,
if,
after
doing
that,
they
created
an
odd
shape,
and
the
oddness
of
that
shape
had
nothing
to
do
with
race,
it
was
pure...
that
would
be
constitutional,
but
you
think
that's
not
what
happened
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
are
the
two
principles
right?
are
the
two
principles
correct,
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
the
two
principles
are
correct,
and
then
we'd
have
to
argue
about
what
happens
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
is
correct,
isn't
it,
that's
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
a
mere
correlation
is
not
the
kind
of
link
that
you're
condemning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
they're
just
interested...
i
mean,
a
democratic
legislator
or
city
councilman
who
wants
to
be
reelected
i
take
it
is
interested
only
in
one
thing,
people
who
will
vote
for
him,
and
he
doesn't
care
what
their
color.
so
if
he
sees
st.
mary's
church
on
the
corner,
and
thinks
there
must
be
a
lot
of
catholics
in
that
neighborhood,
and
they
usually
vote
for
me
because
they're
a
certain
political
party
affiliation,
or
a
state
legislator
who
thinks,
i
know
the
synagogue
of
a
certain
kind
is
over
there,
and
he
really
knows
it,
and
happens
by
accident
to
tell
somebody
that's
what
he's
thinking,
is
that
now
all
contrary
to
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
answer
the
first
question
that
justice
stevens
asked?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason...
the
reason
is,
at
least
i
break
this
question
into
two
parts,
or
maybe
three,
and
to
get
to
an
answer
i
have
to
have
your
opinion
on
just
his
first
question,
which
was,
if
these
were
compact,
and
drawn
to
comply
with
section
2,
and
race
was
used...
of
course,
section
2
is
about
race...
wouldn't
that
be
a
compelling
interest?
i
agree
that
justice
o'connor
says
under
miller
it's
a
compelling
interest.
would
that
not
be
a
compelling
interest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
then
do
concede--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
what
i
thought
at
the
beginning--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
they're
drawing
them
now
in
order
to
comply
with
section
2--
--why
do
you
concede
that,
counsel?
[laughter]
the
court
has
never
held
that
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act
is
a
compelling
state
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
ask
you
an
alternative--
--i
think
he's
finishing
answering
my
question.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
thing
i
wonder
about
the
particular
finding
on
page
65a
is,
i've
got
the
point
that
if
these
were
compact
maybe
you
apply
strict
scrutiny,
that
section
2
perhaps
we'd
agree
would
justify
it.
if
they
depart
from
the
compactness
solely
for
nonracial
reasons,
i
think
we
agree,
but
i'm
not
certain,
that
solely
for
nonracial
reasons
it
would
be
okay,
and
then
the
question
is,
what
did
they
do
here,
and
what
he
says
is,
in
order
to
protect
incumbents
other
african
american
voters
were
deliberately
fenced
out.
but
what
it
doesn't
say
is
whether
those
african
american
voters
were
fenced
out
because
they
were
african
americans
or
because
there
was
an
inference
about
their
voting
behavior
in
respect
to
one
incumbent
or
another--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
wouldn't
that
be
key
as
to
why
they
were
fenced
out,
just
as
you've
said
you
might
have
jews
in
a
district
knowing
that
they're
jews
and
likely
to
vote
democrat,
and
you
say
okay,
that's
all
right,
if
the
reason
is
that
they're
likely
to
vote
democrat,
and
isn't
this
silent
as
to
what
the
reason
that
the
african
american
voters
were
or
were
not
fenced
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
that
means
you
do
favor,
or
somebody
could
bring
a
lawsuit
in
any
kind
of
city
council
election,
any
of
the
thousands
of
elections
in
the
united
states
and
try
to
show
that
what
the
council
had
in
mind
was,
it...
all
it
knew
was,
this
is
an
irish
neighborhood,
this
is
a
catholic
neighborhood,
this
is
a
some
other
neighborhood,
and
we're
only
interested
in
whether
they
vote
democrat
or
republican,
but
if
you
could
show
that's
in
the
councilman's
mind
at
the
time
and
he's
making
that
inference,
all
this
would
become
unconstitutional,
thrown
into
the
federal
courts,
et
cetera.
