mr.
daniel
e.
troy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
with
regard
to
the
point
that
was
just
being
made,
at
page
19
of
our
brief
we
cite
to
what
the
district
court
says.
what
the
district
court
found
exactly
was
that
texas,
quote,
repeatedly
segregated
african
american,
hispanic,
and
anglo
populations
by
race
1)
to
further
the
prospects
of
incumbent
officeholders...
i'm
adding
the
one...
or
2)
to
create
majority
minority
congressional
districts.
these
districts
were
conceived
for
the
purpose
of
providing
safe
seats
in
congress
for
two
african
american
representatives
and
hispanic
representatives.
your
honors,
the
indirect
and
direct
evidence
overwhelmingly
supports
the
district
court's
finding
that
race
was
the
predominant
factor
in
the
drawing
of
these
bizarre,
single
race
majority
districts.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
your
honor,
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
they
pursued
a
maximization
policy
basically
constructing
these
majority
minority
single...
actually
single
race
majority
districts
essentially
for
their
own
sake,
and
then
race
was
used
as
a
tool
for
partisan
advantage.
that--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--well--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--first
of
all,
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--first
of
all,
in
harris
county
what
they
did
was,
they
were
separating
the
races,
hispanics
and
blacks,
because
the
communities
were
demanding
their
own
districts
for
their
own
sake.
but
with
respect
to
dallas
county
what
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
is
that
the
architect
of
the
district,
eddie
bernice
johnson,
went...
tried
to
create
a
performing
single
race
majority
black
district,
and
the
reason
why...
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
it
was
not
compact,
in
fact
the
court
found
the
predominant
reason
why
it
was
not
compact
was
she
testified
in
the
terrazas
v.
slagle
litigation
that
she
shed
black
voters
in
the
south
dallas
area,
and
she
testified
because
they
tend
to
be
more
transient,
they
tend
to
not
turn
out
as
well,
and
so
then,
in
order
to
preserve
the
single
raceness
of
the
district
she
went
north
into
colin
county,
west
into
tarrant
county,
hither
and
yon
in
order
to
gather
as
many
blacks
as
possible
in
order
to
preserve
that
as
a
single
race
majority
district.
that
was
the
overall
goal.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--miller
says
that
if
the
predominant
motivation
in
drawing
the
district
was
race,
then
it's
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
so
the
only--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
is,
in
essence,
a
hypothetical
that
would
not
really
arise
in
part
because
by
definition,
if
you're
taking
into
account
compactness,
contiguity,
traditional
political
subdivisions,
you
are...
race
is
not
the
predominant
motivation.
it
may
be
an
important
motivation,
but
it
is
one
of
a
number
of
motivations.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
if
you're
creating
a
compact
majority
minority
district,
then
you
are
necessarily
taking
into
account
other
factors,
i.e.,
compactness,
contiguity,
traditional
subdivisions,
and
the
fact
that
you've
got
a
naturally
occurring
community
of
people.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
would
say
that
it
is...
it
is
permissible
to
take
race
into
account
in
districting
so
long
as
it
is
not
the
predominant
factor.
that
is
what
miller
says.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
think
if
you
create
it
consistent
with...
with,
again,
looking
for
naturally
occurring
communities,
so
it
is
clear
that
what
you're
not
trying
to
do
is
achieve
a
certain
racial
goal,
and
that's
not
your
primary...
that's
not
your
predominant--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think
that's...
that,
if...
again,
i
think
if
someone
swears
on
a
stack
of
bibles
the
only
reason
i
tried
to
do
this
was
race,
and
that
was...
then
under
miller
it
would
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
then--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--but
your
honor,
they
did
not
achieve
their
objective
consistent
with
compactness.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
think--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--if
race
is
the
driving
factor,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
miller,
then
it's
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
don't--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--well--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--yes.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
and
i
think
that's...
it's...
sorry.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
totally
agree
with
that.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
think
that--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think
whatever
label
you--
[laughter]
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
yes,
that
is--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--that
is
my
answer.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--miller
explicitly--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--if--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--if
it
so
happens--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--if
it...
if
there
is
a
confluence
and
a
coincidence,
and
race
was
not
the
reason
why,
race
was
not
the
tool
for
finding
out
who
are
democrats,
then
certainly,
if
it
just
so
happens
that
the
district
is
more
black
than
not
and
more
democratic
than
not,
that's
okay,
but--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
they
have
made
that
determination.
the
only
data
that
was
put
on
the
computer
that
was
on
a
block
by
block
level
was
racial
data.
chris
sharman,
who
drew...
the
computer
operator
sat
at
the
computer
and
inevitably
racial
numbers
came
up
no
matter
what.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
think
the
record
does
show
that,
your
honor.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
race
was
used
as
a
tool
for
protecting
incumbents,
and
miller
explicitly
rejects
use
of
race
as
a
proxy.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
you
can't
use
race
for
mere
administrative
convenience.
simply
because
it's
easier
to
use
race
to
determine
who's
a
democrat
does
not
justify
the
use
of
race.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
it
did
not.
registration
data
was
not
available
on
that
computer.
what
was
available
on
that
computer
below
the
block
level...
below
the
precinct
level
was
only
racial
data.
at
the
precinct--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--at
the
level
of
each
block,
of
each
census
block
they
had
racial
data,
and
racial
data
only.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
and
that
was
the
primary
tool
that
was
used
for
dividing
up
these
districts.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
the
precinct
level,
and
they
could
only
bring
up--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--on
this
computer
they
could
only
bring
up
a
single
election,
and
the
district
court
found
that
that
is
really
not
what
they
used.
in
fact,
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
to
the
extent
that
partisan
data
was
used
in
the
process,
it
was
only
known
to
the
congressional
incumbents
and
to
their
staffers,
and
they
might
occasionally
call
up
chris
sharman
and
tell
him
some
stuff,
but
by
and
large
he
used
race
as
the
tool,
and
the
partisan
data
was
not
systematically
available.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
that
is
not...
that
is
exactly
xx
what
happened
here.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
the
two
principles
are
right,
but
that
is
by
no
means
what
happened
here.
what
happened--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--in
harris
county,
they
were--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--if
there's
absolutely
no
link
between
the
shape
and
the
racial
demographics,
then...
then
race
was
not
the
motivating
factor.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--if
the
state
accomplished
its
asserted
goal
of
partisan
gerrymandering
through
the
use
of
nonracial
data,
then
that
is
permissible,
but...
but,
here
they
used
racial
data
to
accomplish
that
goal,
and
that
is
we
think
completely
forclosed
by...
for
example,
if,
in
gomillion,
someone
had
said,
well,
we
didn't
fence
out
the
blacks
in
order
to...
in
order
merely
for
discriminatory
reasons,
we
fenced
out
the
blacks
because
we
wanted
to
be
sure
that
we
could
be
reelected
because
we
know
blacks
won't
vote
for
us,
that
is
completely
impermissible.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
similarly,
in...
this
court
has
never
permitted
a
township
to
say,
well,
we
want
to
maintain
property
values,
and
the
best
way
that
we
could
do
that
is
by
using...
is
by
using
something
that
is
discriminatory
in
purpose,
but
our
real
goal...
our
real
goal
is
to
preserve--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--okay.
that's--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think
if
you
have
two
compact,
contiguous,
naturally
occurring--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
impermissible
for
a
state
to
go
block
by
block
dividing
up
an
integrated
polish
or
jewish
community.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
don't
think
so.
i
do
not
think
you
can
go
block
by
block,
house
by
house--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--absolutely.
a
religious
gerrymander
is
as
impermissible
as
a
racial
gerrymander.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
if
you're
going--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think
if
at
a
certain
point
the
predominant
goal
is
the
separation
of
races
or
religions
or
ethnicities,
if
that
is
the
tool
that
is
used
to
accomplish
incumbency
protection,
then
that
is
constitutionally--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--well,
i
think
i
gave
the
answer
on...
the
motivation...
the
motivation
does
not
matter
if
the
means
is
race
or
ethnicity.
this
court
has
said
it
doesn't
matter
what
your
ultimate
goal
is,
you
cannot
use
certain
forbidden
tools.
race
is
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
be
used
as
a
tool--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--well,
that's
in
essence--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--a
question
of
fact--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--for
the
district
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
predominant
motivation
was
whether
they
were
democrats
or
whether
they
were
blacks.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
again,
it's
a
question
of
fact
as
to
what--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--it
is
not
suspect
to
get
democrats.
it
is
suspect
to
use
race
as
a
tool
or
religion
as
a
tool
to
tell
who
is
of
one
party
affiliation
or
another
because
race
is
immutable
and
politics
are
not,
and
the
use
of
race
is
so
dangerous
that
this
court
has
said
that
it
should
not
be
used
unless
there
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
it
is
being
used
in
a
narrowly
tailored
way.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
well,
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
don't
really
think
i
conceded
that.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
thank
you,
your
honor.
that's
what
i
thought
i
said.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
no,
i
don't
think
i
did.
i
think--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--your
honor,
i
think
if
you
start
out
and
race
is
your
only
goal,
then
maybe
the
voting
rights
act--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--let
me
explain.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
and
if
i
did,
perhaps
i
misspoke.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
okay,
i
misspoke.
[laughter]
i
apologize.
if
your
goal,
your
dominant
goal
is
racial,
then
strict
scrutiny
applies,
okay.
now,
it
may
well
be--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
think
the
voting
rights
act
prohibits--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think
the
department
of
justice's
maximization
policy
was
hanging
like
a
sword
of
damocles
over
this
entire
process.
they
went
in
with
the
assumption...
and
this
case
is
sort
of
miller
but
without
the
department
of
justice
playing
its
heavy
hand.
they
went
in
with
the
assumption
that
so
long
as
they
maximized
they
would
be
okay
with
the
department
of
justice,
and
therefore
they
could
do
anything
else
they
want,
use
race
as
a
tool
for
purposes
of
incumbency
protection,
and
that
they
did
not
have
to
narrowly
tailor
these
districts
to
make
them
comport
to
requirements
of
section
2,
if,
indeed,
section
2
is
implicated.
but
section
2
only
requires
geographically
compact
districts.
these
are
not
geographically
compact
districts.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
it
seems
to
me
if
the
voting
rights
act
requires
you
to
draw
these
districts--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--if
the
voting
rights
act
required
you
to
draw--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
don't
think
i
follow
your
second
question.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
sorry.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
they
have
to
redraw
the
districts.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
your
honor,
we
do
not
think
that
under
the
voting
rights
act
they
can
create
single
race
majority
districts
here
because
the
communities
in
question
do
not
live
in
a
sufficiently
geographically
compact
area
to
require
drawing
of
single
race
majority
districts,
and
that
is
what
they
tried
to
do
here.
they
set
out
to
draw
single
race
majority
districts.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
oh,
yes.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
we
believe
that
if
section
2--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--absolutely.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
if
section
2
required
these
districts
to
be--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--yes.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
that
is
true,
the
court
has
never
held
that,
but--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--we
believe
that
in
trying
to
have
the
state
avoid
the
horns
of
a
dilemma,
a
dilemma
which,
by
the
way,
we
think
they
falsely
posit
because
they
overinterpret
the
voting
rights
act
in
far
too
broad
a
way,
but
we
think
that
if
you
interpret
the
voting
rights
act
in
a
constitutional
way
to
say
that
it
simply
prohibits
discriminatory
packing
and
cracking,
then
avoiding
discriminatory
packing
and
cracking
can
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
but
it
turns
upon,
your
honor,
how
you
interpret
the
voting
rights
act,
and
we
think
that
certainly
if
the
state
sought
to
comply
with
their
interpretation,
or
with
the
department
of
justice's
maximization
policy,
then
it
would
never
be...
it
could
not
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
so
it
depends
upon
how
you
interpret
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
it--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--if
you
start
out
and
your
goal
is
to
create...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
really
have
it
both
ways.
if
you
want
to
say,
we
are
going
to
draw
remedial
districts
to
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act,
then
you're
almost
by
definition,
i
believe,
going
to
be
in
strict
scrutiny,
because
you
are
using
race
for
a
remedial
purpose.
then
the
question--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
you
set
out
to
create
a
racial
goal,
and
your
goal
is
to
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act,
and
that
is
a
remedial
statute,
and
your
purpose
in
complying
with
it
is
remedial,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
your
overwhelming
purpose,
because
we're
talking
about
the
use
of
race
here,
must
be
remedial,
and
that--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--that--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think
that's
right,
that
is
your
starting
point.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
if
you
start
out
with--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--yes.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
if
you
start
out
with
the
goal--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--of
accomplishing
race,
and
you
use
race
as...
at
all
times
to
make
sure...
abandoning
compactness,
abandoning
requirements
of
the
voting
rights
act--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--strict
scrutiny.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
if
race
was
the
predominant
factor
in
drawing--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--strict
scrutiny.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
think,
your
honor,
if
race
is
the
predominant
motivation,
and
you
look--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--right.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
miller
talks
about
the
indirect
and
the
direct
evidence,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
texas
tries
to
say
that
their
only
districting
principle
ever
has
been
incumbency
protection,
and
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
texas
had
traditionally
adhered
to
and
followed
other
traditional
districting
principles
and
it
had,
in
fact,
abandoned
compactness.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
they
were
all
texas
judges.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
if
i--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--your
honor,
in
this
case
the
african
american
and
the
hispanic
communities
in
harris
county
were
simply
pulled
apart
for
their
own
sake.
that
is
what
the
district
court
found.
they
were
pulled
apart
because
the
hispanic
community
said,
we
want
our
own
district,
and
we
don't
care
about
gingles,
we
don't
care
about
compactness,
we
want
our
own
district.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
in
fact,
i
did
not
say
that.
i
said
you
cannot--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--in
fact,
i
did.
i
said
that
neither
race
nor
religion
may
be
used
as
a
proxy
for
determining
political
affiliation.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
the
reason
why
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
happen,
your
honor,
is
because
of
compactness,
contiguity,
respect
for
political
subdivision.
what
i
understand
what
happens
in
city
councils
throughout
the
country
is
they
take
a
look
at
particular
neighborhoods,
particular
areas
of
interest,
where
people
have
things
in
common
like
the
schools
they
go
to,
the
places
they
shop,
the
water
supply,
the
potholes
in
the
streets.
what
they
did
in
this
case
was,
they
abandoned
that
and
they
said
we
are
going
to,
particularly
in
harris
county,
we're
going
to
separate
the
races.
we're
going
to
take
someone
who
lived
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
city
and
who's
always
voted
in
district
18,
who's
hispanic,
we're
going
to
take
al
vera
and
we're
going
to
lump
him
with
the
hispanics
in
the
southwest...
in
the
southeastern
part
of
the
city
because
he
is
hispanic.
that
seems
to
me
to
not
respect
traditional
principles
and
to
be
affirmatively
unconstitutional.
and
your
honors,
in
texas
what
the
court
found,
in
dallas
what
the
court
found
is
that
simply,
there
was
capitulation
to
a
demand
by
the
dallas
black
community
that...
i'm
quoting
the
department
of
justice's
narrative,
the
narrative
to
the
department
of
justice.
this
is
what
texas
told
the
department
of
justice,
that
"the
dallas
black
community
insisted
that
a
safe
black
district
be
drawn
that
had
a
total
black
population
of
at
least
50
percent.
"
that's
at
the
joint
appendix
at
106.
your
honors,
we've
gotten
off
on
the...
because
we've
been
entertaining
hypotheticals
we've
gotten
far
away
from
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
race
was
used
as
a
tool
for
incumbency
protection
only
secondarily.
primarily,
there
was
this
maximization
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
that
everybody
knew
about.
they...
eddie
bernice
johnson
specifically
said,
my
policy
was,
if
it
could
be
drawn
it
must
be
drawn,
and
all
other
concerns
were
subordinated
to
that,
and
so
that
is
what
happened
here,
and
that,
we
submit,
is
unconstitutional.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
caught
your
first
hypothetical,
and
my
time
is
up,
but
i'd
be
happy
if
the
chief
justice
will
permit
me
to--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--the
first
part--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--i
think
if
your
motivations
are
political,
then
your
motivations
are
political.
if
your
motivations
are
racial,
your
motivations
are
racial,
and
if
your
motivations
are--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--political...
for
noncompactness?
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
it
can
be,
yes.
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
noncompactness
on
the
basis
of
race,
no.
if
it's
noncompactness...
if--
mr.
daniel
e.
troy
--if
there
are
just
whites,
and
it's
just
a
democrat,
and
you
jiggle
the
lines,
that's
okay.
