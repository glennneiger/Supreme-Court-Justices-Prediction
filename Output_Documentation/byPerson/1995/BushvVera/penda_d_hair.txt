ms.
penda
d.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
think
i'll
just
pick
up
with
the
last
point,
which
is
whether
race
was
being
used
as
a
surrogate,
and
let
me
use
the
dallas
area
as
an
example.
representative
frost
and
bryant,
congresspeople
frost
and
bryant
were
the
two
white
democrats
that
bordered
on
the
new
opportunity
district
that
was
being
squeezed
in
between
them
in
dallas
county.
they
took
about
483,000
people
out
of
dallas
county
and
of
those
53...
roughly
53,000
were
african
american.
those
two
democrats
were
looking
for
democratic
voters
of
any
race,
and
they
were
looking
for
voters
that
they
had
previously
represented.
the
district
court
erred
because
the
district
court
said
that...
and
it's
a
legal
error.
the
district
court
said
that
protection
of
incumbents
is
the
equivalent
of
a
racial
factor,
so
all
of
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
that
race
predominated
in
the
construction
of
these
districts
is
tainted
by
the
legal
error
that
protecting
incumbents
constituted
a
part
of
the
racial
gerrymander.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
race
was
used
to
decide
whether
a
majority
minority
district
can
be
created,
and
again
i'll
use
dallas
as
the
example.
in
dallas
what
you
see
is,
you
see
the
compact
part
of
the
minority
opportunity
district,
district
30,
is
south
dallas.
it's
a
neighborhood
with
a
community
of
interest
that
is
69
percent
african
american.
it
shows
up
nice
and
almost
oval
on
the
district
map.
the
arms
of
that
district
that
go
to
the
north
are
majority
white,
and
what
happened
is
that
when
congressmen
frost
and
bryant
came
into
dallas
county
and
peeled
off,
as
i
said,
almost
half
a
million
white
voters,
the
district
had
to
go
north
to
pick
up
population.
in
going
north,
race
was
one
of
the
factors
that
was
considered,
but
it
certainly
was
not
the
only
factor.
the
irregular
arm
to
the
west
goes
out
to
grand
prairie
and
picks
up
white
voters.
congressman...
senator,
then
senator
johnson
was
eager
to
represent
those
white
voters
in
grand
prairie
because
they
had
been
in
her
senate
district.
that
was
not
on
the
basis
of
race.
another
arm
to
the
left
goes
out
and
picks
up
the
airport,
and
the
main
northern
arm
goes
up
through
the
center
of
dallas
county,
picks
up
about
20
percent
african
american
voters
and
80
percent
non
african
american
voters.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
yes,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
a
minority
community
of
interest
existed
in
south
dallas
that
could
be
recognized.
it
could
have
been
recognized,
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
in
a
nice
compact
district
that
would
have
been
similar
to
the
districts
that
this
court
upheld
summarily
in
the
california
case,
dewitt.
instead,
what
happened
is
that
that
minority
community
of
interest,
like
all
other
communities
of
interest
across
the
state,
saw
its
district
become
irregular
not
because
of
race...
there
was
a
nice
district
there
that
would
have
satisfied
the
voting
rights
act...
but
because
of
protection
of
incumbents.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
your
honor,
on
page
65a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--the
court
said
that
incumbency
protection
is
part
of
the
racial
gerrymander,
and
the
court
did
that
because
it
confused
the
fact
that
some
african
americans
were
taken
out
of
the
area
that
normally
would
have
been
the
most
compact
version
of
district
30
in
dallas,
for
example,
but
a
lot
more
whites
were
taken
out,
and
that
was
error.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
your
honor,
it
would
not
be,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
that's
a
very
important
question,
because
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
requirement
of
compactness.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
oh,
if
a
minority
opportunity
district
were
compact?
ms.
penda
d.
hair
i
think
the
district
court
would
uphold
it,
but
the
problem--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--but
how
they
look,
and
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
that
is
very
important,
because
my
clients
who
live
in
these
districts
need
to
be
able
to
bargain
and
compromise
in
the
political
process
just
like
all
other
communities
of
interest
across
the
state,
and
to
single
out
minority
opportunity
districts
and
say
that
they
have
to
have
a
special
federal
rule
of
compactness
that
does
not
apply
to
majority
white
districts
or
any
other
districts
in
texas
we
believe
disadvantages
them
in
the
process.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
i
think,
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
constitutional,
and
that
would
be
race
as
predominant,
but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
these
are
integrated
districts
that
were
drawn
with
bare
populations
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
voting
rights
act,
and
then
for
other
reasons
they
became
noncompact.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
intentionally
to--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--to
guarantee
the
election
of
a
white--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
under
the
voting
rights
act.
i'm
sorry,
under
the
constitution,
and
the
difference
is
that
where
you
have
the
voting
rights
act,
the
voting
rights
act
does
provide
a
justification
for
taking
race
into
account,
because
we
do
have
racially
polarized--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--well,
the
court
has
not
explicitly--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--upheld
the
constitution...
the
constitutionality
of
the
gingles
standard,
but
it
has
not
been--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
we
would
submit
that
it
does.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
okay.
with
regard
to
district
30...
it's
at
the
top...
we
conclude
that
the
policy
of
incumbent
protection--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--to
the
extent
it
motivated
the
legislature
was
not
a
countervailing
force
against
racial
gerrymandering.
instead,
racial
gerrymandering
was
an
essential
part
of
incumbency
protection.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
and
our
position
is
that
the
court
was
legally
in
error
when
it
said
that
the
fact
that
congressmen
frost
and
bryant
came
in
and
took
a
huge
amount
of
population,
that
that
was
part
of
a
racial
gerrymander.
that
was
solely
to
get
democratic
voters
that
they
had
previously
represented
and
black
voters,
just
like
a
bunch
of
white
voters,
got
caught
up
in
there.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
your
honor,
our
position
is
that--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--that...
no,
if
you...
the
district
court
committed
legal
error
because
it
confused
taking
people...
taking
democratic
voters
with
taking
people
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
that
caused
it
to
reach
that
conclusion.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
i
think
the
record
is
clear,
your
honor,
that
congressmen
frost
and
bryant
came
in
and
took
voters
of
all
races
that
they
had
previously--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--your
honor,
yes.
if
you
cannot
find
that
incumbent
protection
was
not
equivalent
to
race,
then
i
think
it
should
be
remanded
so
that
we
can
establish
that
in
the
district
court.
