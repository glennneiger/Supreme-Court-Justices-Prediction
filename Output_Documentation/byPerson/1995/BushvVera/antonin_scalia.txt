justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
aguilar,
what
is
this
opportunity
district?
this
is
new
terminology.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
we
just
call
them
majority
minority
districts?
i
mean,
you're
entitled
to
use
whatever
terminology...
you
can
call
them,
you
know,
motherhood
apple
pie
districts
if
you
like,
but
you
will
be
insulting
my
intelligence
every
time
you
say
it.
can't
we
give
it
some,
you
know,
unemotive
terminology
that
we
can
use
in
the
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
aguilar,
let
me
understand
what
you're
saying
about
the
incumbency
justification.
is
it
that
if...
let's
say
you
have
a
black
or
hispanic
congressman.
it
is
okay
to
use
race
as
a
criterion
in
drawing
a
district
so
long
as
its
purpose
is
to
protect
the
seat
of
that
congressman.
that
is,
i
draw
a
majority
black
district
or
a
majority
hispanic
district
because
the
incumbent
happens
to
be
a
black
or
a
hispanic.
is
that...
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
say
that's
a
valid
objective
even
though
race
is
the
means
of
achieving
that
objective,
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
do
you
say
that
race
was
not
used
here?
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
your
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
your
answer
to
my
question
must
be
yes,
then.
if
i
have
a
black
congressman,
i
can
say,
i
want
to
protect
that
congressman's
seat
and
therefore,
simply
because
i
want
to
protect
that
congressman's
seat,
it
is
okay
to
draw
a
black
district.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
thought
that
narrow
tailoring
applied
to
kicking
over
any
more
of
the
normal
criteria
for
district
drawing
than
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
objective.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
of
which
would
be
compactness
and
contiguity.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bender,
is
your
answer
the
same...
well,
let
me
ask
this
first.
the
appellees'
brief
cites
a
law
review
article
in
the
michigan
law
review
which
rates
districts
in
the
country
for
irregularity,
and
according
to
that
law
review
article,
districts
18
and
29
are
tied
for
first
with
one
other
district
in
the
country,
as
the
district
with
the
least
regular
borders
in
the
country.
is
that
accurate
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
up
there...
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
other
area
where
we
allow
this,
where
we
allow
race
to
be
used
as
a
surrogate
for
some
other
desirable
policy?
i
thought
that
what
our
constitution
requires
is
that
no
matter
how
accurate
the
generalization
may
be,
you
can't
use
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
asking
about
this
situation.
do
you
know
any
other
situation
in
the
law
in
which
we
allow
race
to
be
used
as
a
surrogate
for
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
race
is,
in
fact,
as
you
suggest,
a
real
surrogate,
then
you
don't
have
to
use
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
look
for
democrats.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
a
more
thoughtful
racism?
how
was
this
done?
i
thought
that's
why
you
said
this
was
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
wanted
democrats.
we
know,
you
know,
blacks
are
democrats,
and
therefore
we
ended
up
with
these--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
was
there
any
need
at
all
to
consider
their
race
if
they
wanted
democrats?
they
knew
how
people
voted
in
certain
areas,
and
they
knew
that
people
in
certain
areas
both
voted
democrat
and
were
black.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
they
went
beyond
looking
at
the
precinct
lists
to
see
that
they
were
democrats
when
they
did
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
doubt
that
we
ever
assume
that
in
any
case
there
would
ever
be
a
situation
in
which
nothing
but
race
is
considered.
of
course,
there
are
always
other
factors,
but
that
doesn't
prove
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hair,
would
you
help
me
out?
i
looked
at
page
65a
of
the
appendix.
what
is
the
precise
language
you
rely
on
in
the
opinion
on
65a?
i
find
the
court
saying,
we
conclude
that
the
policy
of
incumbent
protection
to
the
extent
it
motivated
the
legislature--
--where
you
are
reading
from?
page
65a
of
the
joint...
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
which
is
what
counsel
cited.
maybe
i
got
the
wrong
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i
take
that
to
mean
that
the
court
says
you
can't...
you
can
protect
incumbents,
but
not
by
using
race
as
the
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
took
them
as
blacks,
that's
what
this
sentence
says,
that
to
the
extent
incumbent
protection
motivated
the
legislature,
it
was
incumbent
protection
achieved
by
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
how
i
read
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
in
assuming
that
it's
okay
to
do
incumbent
protection
not
by
deciding
who
are
democrats,
but
by
deciding
who
are
blacks.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not--
--so--
--that
is
making
one
of
the
traditional
criteria
itself
depend
upon
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
page
65a,
which
we
just
read
before,
said
that.
i
thought
that's
exactly
what
it
said,
that
instead,
racial
gerrymandering
was
an
essential
part
of
incumbency
protection,
it
was
the
tool
for
incumbency
protection.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
in--
--what
does
the
statute
require,
then?
i
mean,
i
certainly
agree
with
you,
i
had
understood
our
constitution
to
prevent
the
use
of
race
as
a
surrogate
for...
however
good
the
objective
may
be,
you
can't
use
it,
but
then
what
does
the...
doesn't
the
voting
rights
act,
or
our
interpretation
of
it
make
the
opposite
assumption?
how
am
i
to
reconcile
the
two?
doesn't
it
assume
that
in
order
to
have
what
is
being
called
here
minority
opportunity
you
need
to
herd
minority
voters
together
because
they
will
all
vote
the
same
way?
isn't
that
the
assumption
of
our
interpretation
of
the
act,
or
of
the
act
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't.
well,
then,
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
are
they
worried
about
creating
minority...
majority
minority
districts
in
order
to
comply
with
the
act,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right--
--it
depends
on
what
miller
means
by
subordinated.
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
if
you
start
out
with
objection
number
1
to
create
a
majority
minority
district,
that
is
your
primary
goal.
everything
else,
even
though
you
follow
other
criteria,
could
be
regarded
as
subordinated
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
your
starting
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
troy,
i
didn't
understand
you
to
say
what
justice
breyer
just
said.
maybe
you
agree
with
him.
i
didn't
understand
you
to
say
that
you
could
include,
let's
say
jews
in
a
district
because
you
know
that
jews
will
vote
democratic.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
just
the
opposite.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
he's
asking
for
noncompactness
on
the
basis
of
race.
