mr.
javier
aguilar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
at
issue
in
this
direct
appeal
is
the
constitutionality
of
three
congressional
districts
that
the
court
below
erroneously
ruled
were
racially
gerrymandered.
these
districts
are
localized
in
two
metropolitan
areas
of
the
state
of
texas,
two
counties,
harris
county
and
dallas
county.
the
districts
involved
are
congressional
districts
18,
which
is
a
black
opportunity
district
that
was
created
originally
in
the
1970's
in
harris
county,
congressional
district
29,
which
is
a
brand
new
congressional
district,
which
is
now
a
hispanic
opportunity
district
in
harris
county,
and
congressional
district
30,
which
is
a
black
opportunity
district
in
dallas
county,
a
brand
new
black
opportunity
district.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well,
it's
a
majority
minority
district
that
was
created
under--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
i'll
refer
to
them
as
majority
minority
districts.
the
district
court
we
believe
legally
erred
in
its
finding
below
that
the
three
districts
were
racially
gerrymandered
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
held
that
race
predominated
in
the
drawing
of
the
districts,
but
it
did
so
because
it
refused
to
recognize
the
state's
customary
and
traditional
redistricting
principle
of
incumbency
protection,
as
well
as
other
principles
that
it
utilized,
including
the
equal
population
rule
that
it
always
follows
and
it
must
follow--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
yes,
sir,
it
is
a
question
of
fact,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case...
they
decided
this
case
before
miller
v.
johnson,
and
i
think
their
opinion
is
clear
that
they
did
not
believe
that
incumbency
protection
should
be
considered
a
traditional
districting
principle
because
it
was
not
among
those
listed
in
the
shaw
v.
reno
case
to
begin
with.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
determination
of
what
is
a
customary
and
traditional
districting
principle
is
something
that
is
determined
by
the
state
and
its
practices,
its
historical
practices,
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
in
this
case
there's
plenty
of
evidence
to
show
that
texas
has
followed
the
traditional
practice
of
incumbency
protection
to
decide
where
it's
going
to
draw
its
districts,
and
incumbency
protection
as
applied
by
the
texas
legislature,
certainly
in
the
1990's,
really
has
four
aspects,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
it
is
not
pairing
incumbents.
it
will
not
vote
for
a
plan
that
does
not
pair
incumbents,
simply
because
they
want
to
preserve
the
state's
congressional
seniority.
second,
it
means
that
if
you're
going
to
have
to
redraw
districts,
which
they
had
to
because
of
the
fact
that
the
population
had
increased
so
greatly
in
texas
that
we
had
been
reapportioned
three
different
districts,
that
you
try
to
maintain
the
constituency
of
each
of
the
congresspeople.
mr.
javier
aguilar
no,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
their
decision
is
legally
wrong
because
it
did
not
properly
apply
the
rule
of
miller
v.
johnson.
now,
in
fact,
quite
frankly
they
didn't
have
it
to
apply
because
it
wasn't
decided
until
sometime
after
the
opinion.
what
we're
saying
is,
they
recognized--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--those
findings
are
tainted,
your
honor,
by
the
legal
error
in
not
recognizing
that
the
state
of
texas
has
a
long
tradition
of
protecting
incumbents,
and
that--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--no,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
that
is--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--it
is
something--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
what
we're
saying
is,
you...
if
you're
going
to
try
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
racial
motivation,
you
look
at
all
the
different
objectives--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that
the
state
utilized.
mr.
javier
aguilar
yes,
your
honor,
and
if
i
may,
they
certainly
considered
that,
and
they
even
acknowledged
in
their
opinion
that
incumbency
protection
was
a
major
objective
in
the
state,
all
over
the
state.
mr.
javier
aguilar
and
they
didn't
particularly
like
it,
and
they
said
as
much,
but
despite
the
fact
that
24
out
of
the
30
districts,
justice
o'connor,
were
challenged
on
these
grounds,
only
these
three
districts
were
found
to
be
racially
gerrymandered,
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
the
court...
refer
to
the
court
to
joint
appendix
at
page
192.
i'd
like
to
use
that
as
an
example,
trying
to
flesh
out
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
javier
aguilar
are
you
asking
in
the
shaw
opinion,
your
honor?
mr.
javier
aguilar
i
think
it
recognized
that
it
was
a
motivation
of
the
legislature
all
over
the
state.
i
think
it
certainly
recognized
and
accepted
that.
i
think
that
in
the
process
of
accepting
that--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--no,
your
honor.
they
believed
that
incumbency
protection
was
not
something
that
this
court
referred
to
in
the
shaw
decision
and,
consequently,
since
it
didn't
fall
within
the...
those
factors
that
this
court
referenced
in
shaw,
therefore
it
wasn't
something
that
they
could
pay
attention
to,
and
i
think--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that
is--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that
is
exactly
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well,
no,
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
you
can...
the
legislature
can
apply
its
traditional
motivation
of
incumbency
protection,
and
just
because
it's
applying
it
in
an
area
where
there
are
blacks
or
hispanics
living,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
end
result
is
a
racial
gerrymander.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well,
if
the
predominant
motivation
is
just
collecting
as
many
minorities
that
you
can
within
one
district,
and
you
don't
care
whether
it
protects
your
incumbents,
you
don't
care
about--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
you
have
to
find
out
why
race
is
considered.
we're
not
saying
that
we
cannot
consider
race,
but
in
our
case,
your
honor--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
in
our...
for
instance,
if
we
had
a
case
where
there
was
no
reason
to
create
this
district...
in
other
words,
there
was
very
little
reason
to
create
a
majority
minority
district
under
the
voting
rights
act,
then
i
would
say
we
would
be
running
afoul
of
this
court's
ruling
in
miller,
but
when
you
have
a
situation
where--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--let
me--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that's
correct,
there
were.
mr.
javier
aguilar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
yes.
mr.
javier
aguilar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well,
they
weren't
drawn
house
to
house,
your
honor,
but
yes,
there
was
in
the
evidence...
in
fact,
the
state
itself
presented
alternative
districts
in
these
three
areas
that
were
geographically
more
compact.
the
plaintiffs
presented
alternative
plans.
their
expert,
mr.
weber,
dr.
weber,
they
had
another
plan,
the
owens
pate
plan.
all
of
their
plans
that
they
presented
were
more
geographically
compact.
the
problem
with
the--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
that's
right.
we
could
draw
other
alternative
districts,
there
was
no
question
about
that.
the
reason
we
didn't--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
our
position--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
our
position
on
narrow
tailoring
is
that
once
there
is
a
reason
to
draw
the
districts
under
the
voting
rights
act,
the
narrow
tailoring
means
you
just
draw
the
district
that's
necessary
that
affords
that
group
an
opportunity
to
elect
someone
of
their
choosing.
mr.
javier
aguilar
the
number
of
districts,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well,
i
think
that...
i
guess
the
best
example
would
be
in
the
miller
case.
the
boundaries
there
were
much...
we're
talking
about
a
totally
different
district
that
spanned
some
200,
250
miles,
that
linked
together
different
cities,
different
disparate
black
populations
that
had
very
little
in
common
with
them,
where
the
district
boundaries
themselves,
the
black
population
was
located
in
the
outer
ridges
of
the
district.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
believe
narrow--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--it's
narrowly
tailored
because
we
first
of
all
realized
that
there
was
a
sufficiently
large
minority
population
in
a
geographically
compact
area,
and
there
was
racially
polarized
voting.
having
made
that
determination,
we
then
drew
a
district
in
that
location.
now,
i
agree
with
the
suggestion
of
justice
o'connor
that
there
were
different
alternatives.
we
could
have
drawn
all
kinds
of
different
boundaries,
but
it
was...
you
know,
politics
is
a
contact
sport--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--and
people
don't
want
to...
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
evidence
is
sufficient
here
to
be
able
to
reverse,
your
honor,
and
render.
i
think
that
the
error
is
one
of
law.
i
think
that--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--i
did
not
complete
my
answer.
the
reason
why
they
didn't,
they
would
not
have,
the
legislature
i'm
talking
about,
would
not
have
accepted
the
proposed
plans
that
the
plaintiffs
proposed
and
even
the
state
plans...
the
districts
that
we
drew
for
litigation
purposes
show
that
we
could,
in
fact,
draw
more
geographically
compact
districts...
was
because
they
would
pair
incumbents.
it's
because
we
would
lose
some
of
our
congressmen
in
congress,
and
we
did
not
want
to
do
that.
mr.
javier
aguilar
if
the
question
ignores
the
requirements
of
the
voting
rights
act,
i
would
say
there
would
be
a
problem,
if
that's
your
only
goal,
but
that's--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--what
i'm
saying,
we
have...
the
texas
legislature
has
the
obligation
to
satisfy
federal
requirements,
and
the
voting
rights
act
is
a
federal
requirement,
but
in
doing
so,
the
state
legislature
ought
to
have,
under
our
federalism,
the
right
to
use
the
same
districting
objectives
as
it
uses
for
all
the
districts.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--race
was
used.
it
had
to
be,
because
our
prime...
because
one
of
our
objectives
was
to
create
a
majority
minority
district--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--pursuant
to
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well,
i
didn't
finish
the
four
different
aspects
of
incumbency.
it's
just
not
protecting
the
incumbent's,
black
incumbent's
seat,
but
rather,
it's
also
protecting
those
around
them,
the
congressmen
around
them,
and
in
this--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
it's--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
no,
your
honor,
not
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
just
posed
to
me,
but
that
was
not
what
we
did
here,
your
honor.
what
we
did
here
was,
we
made
a
determination
that
we--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
in
fact,
many
blacks
that
could
have
been
in
a
more
compact
jurisdiction,
or
a
more
compact
district,
in
fact
didn't
go
into
the
majority
minority
district.
they
remained
in
other
districts,
and
in
fact
they
became
impact
districts,
if
you
will.
mr.
javier
aguilar
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
and
if
i
may
before
my
time
expires,
if
you
look
at
page
192,
that's
the
map
of
the
dallas
area,
district
6
and
district
12
were
not
impacted
by
the
drawing
of
district
30,
and
yet
the
shape
of
both
6
and
12
look
rather
strange.
in
fact--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--they
were
challenged,
your
honor,
but
the
court
held
there
was
no
racial
gerrymandering.
these
are
predominantly
and
overwhelmingly
white
districts.
the
reason
the
districts
look
like
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
race.
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
legislature
was
trying
to
draw
districts
that
those
incumbents
could
be
elected
from,
trying
to
not
only
keep
as
many
constituents
there,
but
also
they're
going
to
have
to
bring
in
constituents,
bring
in
constituents
that
would
be
supportive
of
that
congressman.
