justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
mr.
aguilar,
the
district
court
did
make
findings
that
the
districts
were
formed
in
utter
disregard
for
traditional
redistricting
criteria,
and
were
unexplainable
on
other
than
racial
grounds.
now,
are
those
findings...
do
you
say
either
of
those
are
clearly
erroneous?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
argue
that
protection
of
incumbents
is
a
compelling
state
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
just
saying
it's
a
traditional
state
interest
that
is
followed
in
texas--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
drawing
districts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--all
right,
but
you
did
present
evidence
to
the
district
court
of
protection
of
incumbency.
i
mean,
that
evidence
was
apparently
before
the
district
court,
and
it
nevertheless
found
that
that
may
well
be
so,
but
it
was
overshadowed
here
by
the
decision
in
drawing
the
district
boundaries
to
totally
draw
them
along
racial
lines.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
mr.
aguilar,
was
there
evidence
here
that
majority
minority
districts
could
have
been
drawn
in
18,
29,
and
30
that
would
have
been
more
compact,
and
that
would
not
have
presented
this
racial
gerrymander
problem,
and
nevertheless
have
satisfied
some
of
the
incumbents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
there
were
proposals
made--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--were
there
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
still
would
have
provided
majority
minority
districts
for--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--blacks
and
hispanics.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
wouldn't
have
been
drawn,
you
know,
house
to
house
to
pick
up
certain
particular
voters
in
the
racial
base.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
so
this
case
doesn't
present,
does
it,
a
situation
where
texas
had
no
means
of
assuring
a
racial
composition
and
balance,
even
if
these
peculiar
districts
are
tossed
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
go
to
narrow
tailoring,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
it
might.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
aguilar,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor
you
said
that
they
could
have...
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
answer,
but
i
thought
you
said
that
they
could
have
satisfied
the
minority
majority
district
composition
with
a
more
compact...
that
they
could
have
satisfied
both
incumbency
and
race.
perhaps
you
didn't
complete
your
answer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
you
have
a
district
that's
a
majority
white
district,
and
the
incumbent
says,
look,
we
have
to
redistrict,
and
don't
put
any
blacks
in
my
district.
they
won't
vote
for
me,
and
i
won't
have
it.
you
have
to
protect
me.
now,
is
that
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
the
legislature
then
say,
fine,
we're
concerned
about
you,
mr.
incumbent,
and
so
we'll
exclude
all
blacks
from
your
district.
is
that
constitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
may
have...
it
may
have
been
done
in
reverse.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
no
different
than
in
any
other
state,
is
it?
i
used
to
serve
in
a
state
legislature,
and
i
can
well
remember
scrambling
around
to
protect
incumbents.
that's
a
typical
thing,
isn't
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
think
that
that
overrides
the
need
to
avoid
deciding
boundaries
on
purely
racial
grounds?
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
does
the
state
have
to
follow
the
constitutional
requirement
not
to
draw
lines
on
primarily
a
racial
basis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
there
are
also
degrees
of
incumbent
interest.
some
incumbent
officeholder
might
say,
i
want
a
certain
type
of
voter
in
my
district.
it
wouldn't
double
up
officeholders,
but
nonetheless
i
want
you
to
draw
this
along
racial
lines
because
i
think
i
can
pick
up
voters
that
are
going
to
go
to
the
polls
more
often
than
would
be
the
case
if
it
were
compact.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
suppose
the
same
rule
applies
in
reverse,
that
it
would
not
be
constitutional
for
the
legislature
to
protect
a
white
incumbent
in
a
majority
white
district
by
fencing
out
all
black
voters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
troy,
can
we
go
back
to,
then,
stage
1.
we
have
a
very
compact
district.
it
has
no
arms
or
elbows,
but
it
was
created
to
be
a
minority...
a
majority
minority
district.
race
was
the
consideration,
but
it's
got
wonderfully
compact
bounds,
but
race
was
why
that
district
was
created.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
case,
is
the
evidence
that
the
computer
program
design
used
to
draw
the
lines
such
that
race
became
a
surrogate
for
whatever
was
desired
in
the
incumbency
protection?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
state
didn't
have
to
do
that.
it
could
have
drawn
districts
in
your
view
that
could
have
majority
minority
figures
for
democratic
voters
that
would
enable
a
black
to
be
elected
and
an
hispanic
to
be
elected
in
the
two
adjacent
districts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
did
you
concede
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
did
you
say
it
would
require
strict
scrutiny
if
that
were
the
case?
i
thought
that
was
what
i
understood
your
response
to
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
you
made
some
other
response
to
justice
ginsburg
that
i
missed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you
don't
have
that
here,
do
you?
i
thought
the
finding
was
these
districts
did
not
follow
normal
compactness
and,
indeed,
are
quite
irregular,
so
you
don't
have
the
hypothetical
here,
i
assume.
