justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
is
this
what
you're
saying
in
substance,
that
incumbency
protection
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
number
of
majority
minority
districts.
it
merely
explains
the
shape
of
the
districts,
because
after
you
decided
the
number
you
had
to
satisfy
the
incumbents
and
draw
all
these
squiggly
lines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
they
challenged?
did
anybody
file
suit
to
challenge
6?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your...
may
i
finish
my
question,
please?
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
understanding
of
the
district
court's
holding?
if
the
district
court...
if
the
districts
did
not
have
all
these
strange
appendices,
they
had
precisely
the
same
number
of
majority
minority
black
districts,
but
they
would
be
nicely
shaped
instead,
assuming
that
they
were
given
a
bad
shape
because
of
incumbency
protection,
under
your
view,
would
that
be
an
adequate
remedy
under
the
district
court's
holding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
not...
really
didn't...
i
want...
what
i'm
really
asking
is,
what
is
your
interpretation
of
what
the
district
court
would
do
with
those
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
is
at
issue
is
not
the
number
of
minority
majority
districts,
but
their
shape.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
thought
you
said
in
the
hypothetical
that
it
would
be
compactness
and
other
factors
that
would
be
in
addition
to
race,
and
that's
why
you
say
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
said
if
the
district
were
compact,
the
fact
that
they
might
have
been
motivated
by
an
interest
in
getting
two
or
three
majority
minority
districts
would
not
have
invalidated
the
plan.
you
did
say
that,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
that's--
--did
you
say
that
or
not?
let
me
find
out,
did
you
say
that
or
not?
if
they
were
compact
districts,
contiguous,
nicely
square
in
every
case,
but
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
there
was
a
motive
to
get
two
or
three
majority
minority
districts,
did
you
not
say
that
would
be
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
asking
you,
if
they
were
compact,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
no,
i'm
just
saying,
in
this
case,
if
we
had
compact
districts
such
as
they
started
out
with
before
they
got
into
all
the
incumbency
protection,
would
the
case
be
any
different
in
your
view,
and
i'll
give
you
a
second
question.
you
can
give
me
the
answer
to
both.
under
the
district
court's
reasoning,
if
they
did
create
the
same
number
of
majority
minority
districts
but
they
had
gone
back
to
where
they
had
a
few
more
republican
districts
and
a
few
less
democrat
districts,
as
i
think
would
make
the
difference,
would
that
have
been
all
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
is
the
remedy
that
the
district
court
is
requiring?
they
have
to
redraw
the
districts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
redrawing
them,
can
they
continue
to
have
the
same
number
of
majority
minority
districts
but
differently
shaped?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
one
if
you
do
have
a
minute
left.
supposing
you
started
out
with
three
compact
districts
that
were
contiguous,
and
race
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
drawing
them
that
way,
but
if
you
drew
them
that
way,
the
democrats
were
in
control,
they
found
they
would
create
a
few
more
republican
seats
than
they
wanted
to,
so
they
redrew
them
with
squiggles
to
get
more
democrat
seats...
forget
about
incumbents,
just
party
politics,
simply...
would
that
be
a
permissible
reason
to
do
it,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
a
permissible
reason
to
redraw
and
get
unattractive
districts
in
order
to
protect
the
number
of
democrats,
as
opposed
to
the
number
of
incumbents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
hypothetical
is
that
you
start
with
compact
districts
that
you
would
say
would
barely
pass
muster,
even
though
race
was
an
important
factor
in
picking
them
up,
but
you
get
into
noncompactness
and
gerrymandering
in
districts
like
this
not
to
protect
incumbents
as
such,
but
to
make
sure
that
the
republicans,
who
do
not
control
the
legislature,
won't
get
too
many
seats.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether
a
political
motivation
would
be
a
justification.
