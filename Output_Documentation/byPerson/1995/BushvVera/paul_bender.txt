mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
even
if
strict
scrutiny
is
applicable
to
the
districts
in
this
case,
the
district
court
decision
invalidating
those
districts
was
legally
incorrect
and
it
must
be
reversed.
the
district
court
held
that
although
texas
might
have
a
compelling
interest
in
creating
majority
minority,
or
minority
opportunity
districts
in
dallas
and
houston
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
minorities
in
those
communities,
who
are
the
victims
of
polarized
voting,
to
protect
their
right
to
participate
in
the
process
in
a
fair
way,
that
even
if
texas
had
those
compelling
interests,
the
districts
that
texas
actually
created
were
not
narrowly
tailored.
the
court
held
that
because
it
found
that
texas
could
have
created
three
districts
that
were
more
compact
than
the
ones
that
it
actually
created,
and
that
in
departing
from
compactness,
the
court
flunked
the
narrow
tailoring
test.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
the
niceness
of
the
lines
is
relevant
probably
to
both
aspects
of
it.
one
of
the
ways
that
you
can
depart
from
narrow
tailoring
would
be
to
draw
racial
lines
gratuitously.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
but
i
think
a
state
could
have
a
compelling
interest
to
create
a
majority
minority
district
and
then
put
many
more
minorities
in
that
district
than
were
necessary.
mr.
paul
bender
that
would
be
packing,
and
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
narrow
tailoring
test.
mr.
paul
bender
the
shape
of
the
district
might
be
a
violation
of
the
narrow
tailoring.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
and--
mr.
paul
bender
--and
another
would
be
incumbency
protection.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
and
so
here,
the
fact
that
the
state
could
have
drawn
three
compact
districts,
two
in
houston
and
one
in
dallas...
it
could
have
drawn
a
compact
district
in
dallas
to
provide
black
minorities
there
with
an
opportunity
to
participate
fairly
in
the
process.
it
didn't
do
that,
and
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
on
this.
the
district
court
was
absolutely
clear
on
it.
it
didn't
do
that
because
of
the
interests
of
the
incumbents
who
were
surrounding
that
district.
they
did
not
want
that
compact
district
because
it
took
too
many
democratic
voters
away
from
them,
and
so
they
pulled
democratic
voters
out
of
that
compact
district,
which
required
the
minority
district
to
get
voters
from
some
place
else
in
order
to
both
satisfy
the
one
person
one
vote
requirement
and
remain
a
majority
minority
district.
mr.
paul
bender
i
wouldn't
say
that
they
were
necessarily
tied
for
first,
but
they
are
certainly--
mr.
paul
bender
--among
the
most
irregular
districts
in
the
country,
yes.
i
think
everybody
concedes
that.
in
dallas,
that
irregularity
occurred,
i
think
nobody
doubts
this,
because
of
the
interest
in
protecting
incumbents,
and
texas'
amazingly
strong
interest
in
protecting
incumbents.
that
is
a
very
strong
interest
that
texas
traditionally
has
had
and
continues
to
have
in
districting.
they
used--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think...
but
the
strength
of
it
must
vary
from
place
to
place.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it
doesn't
override
the
need.
the
question
is,
if
a
state
could
draw
a
compact
minority
district
and
it
has
a
compelling
interest
in
doing
that
to
satisfy
the
voting
rights
act
and
perhaps
even
the
constitution,
and
it
also
has
a
very
strong
interest
in
protecting
incumbents,
does
the
state
have
to
choose
between
those
two
interests
and
jettison
one
in
order
to
do
the
other?
mr.
paul
bender
that's
not
a
constitutional
requirement,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
you
said
in
shaw
and
reno
in
writing
for
the
court,
and
justice
kennedy
repeated
for
the
court
in
miller
and
johnson,
that
that's
not
an
absolute
prohibition.
it's
just
something
that
requires
strict
scrutiny,
and
that
strict
scrutiny
is
satisfied
if
there's
a
compelling
interest.
here,
the
district
court
did
not
deny
that
there
was
a
compelling
interest,
but
said,
you've
got
to
choose
between
your
compelling
interest
in
dallas
in
having
a
majority
district
and
protecting
incumbents.
and
in
houston
the
situation
was
a
little
more
complicated.
there
was
incumbent
protection
interest
there,
but
there
was
also
the
fact
that
the
state
had
a
compelling
interest
in
creating
a
hispanic
majority
district
in
houston,
which
could
have
been
compact,
and
in
creating
a
black
majority,
or
in
keeping
a
black
majority
district
in
houston.
mr.
paul
bender
that
would
require
strict
scrutiny.
in
this
case
i
think
the
evidence
shows
that
the
incumbents
did
not
say,
give
us
black
voters
just
because
they're
black
voters.
they
were
looking
for
democratic
voters
to
keep
their
incumbency
safe,
and
in
looking
for
democratic
voters
there
is
a
large
correlation
in
that
part
of
dallas.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
if
you
found
that
their
motivation
was
to
get
black
voters
just
because
they're
black
voters,
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
all
right
to
get
democratic
voters.
mr.
paul
bender
and
if
in
getting
democratic
voters
one
of
the
ways
they
try
to
determine
whether
voters
are
likely
to
be
democratic
or
not
was
to
look
at
their
race,
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--in
that
sense
the
motive
is
a
nonracial
one,
namely
to
protect
incumbency.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
in
this
situation,
if
the
political
reality
is
that
if
you're
looking
for
incumbent--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
can't
think
of
one
off
hand.
mr.
paul
bender
but
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
you
look
for
democrats,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
things
you
look
for
when
you're
looking
for
democrats,
and
i
think
one
of
the
things
you...
if
all
they
did
was
say,
we
want
democrats,
therefore
we
want
black
voters,
justice
scalia,
i
agree
with
you
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
that
kind
of
mindless
racism
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
to
use
it
as
a--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
this
wasn't
done...
no.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
they
used
it
as
one
of
a
number
of
factors
in
deciding
who
would
be
democratic
voters
to
put
in
that
district.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
i
think,
however,
the
record
shows
that
in
doing
that
what
they
ended
up
doing
was
bringing
black
voters
into
their
districts,
but
the
motive
was,
what
they
were
doing
was
looking
for
democrats.
justice
scalia,
in
that
area
of
dallas
there
are
a
lot
of
black
voters,
and
so
that's
what
you're
going
to
do
if
you
look
for
democrats.
thank
you.
