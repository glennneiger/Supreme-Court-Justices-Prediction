justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
may
i
ask
you
to
go
one
step
further?
i
take
it,
of
course,
because
they
were
deciding
before
miller
came
down,
i
take
it
that
what
the
court
was
doing
was
saying
that
predominant
racial
motive
is
an
alternative
to
incumbency
protection
as
a
factor,
whereas
your
argument
is
after...
i
think,
after
miller,
we
judge
what
is
a
predominant
racial
motive
by
asking,
among
other
things,
whether
it
was
done
in
disregard
of
traditional
districting
practices,
and
your
final
step
is,
incumbency
protection
is
one
of
the
objects
of
traditional
districting
practices.
so
that
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
the
court
made
an
either
or
choice
when
there
wasn't
an
either
or
choice.
the
two
alternatives
that
it
was
opposing
to
each
other
are
not
really
opposing
alternatives.
it
should
have
considered
incumbency
protection
in
deciding
whether
the
motive
was
predominantly
racial.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
fair?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
with
mr.
aguilar
that
that
is
basically
a
confusion
of
categories,
that
narrow
tailoring
goes
basically
to
number
of
districts,
and
the
niceness
of
the
lines
with
which
they
are
drawn
is
essentially
the
question,
or
is
essentially
an
issue
that
you
look
at
when
you're
deciding
whether,
in
fact,
the
motive
was
predominantly
racial
as
distinct
from
a
motive
consistent
with
customary
districting
practices?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
suppose
if
you...
there's
a
point
at
which
the
line
is
crossed
between
protecting
an
incumbent
who
draws
votes
predominantly
from
one
race,
on
the
one
hand,
and
packing
on
the
other
hand,
but
that
is
an
inquiry,
i
take
it,
that
you
would
make
at
the
point
where
you're
saying,
what
is
the
predominant
motive
here
in
order
to
determine
whether
strict
scrutiny
applies
at
all?
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
be
packing.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
the
shape
of
the
district.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
mr.
bender--
--no,
but
you
don't
have...
excuse
me.
well,
go
on.
i
was
going
to--
--let
me
just
follow
up
on
one
of
justice
scalia's
questions.
but
if
you
cannot
draw
a
majority
minority
district
without
jettisoning
your
traditional
districting
principles,
you
don't
have
to
do
it.
in
other
words,
section
2
does
not
require
you
to
throw
out
the
tradition
of
districting
in
order
to
create
a
majority
minority
district,
and
if
that
were
the
case,
then
you
wouldn't
have
the
compelling
interest
of
complying
with
section
2.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
an
earlier
statement
that
you
made
on
that
point?
did
the
court
say
in
so
many
words
that
we
identify
the
protection
of
incumbents
with
racial
gerrymandering?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
it
put
it
neatly
somewhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
find
the
statement
is
more
ambiguous
than
you
say,
should
we
simply
remand
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
let's
assume
that
we've
read
that
and
we
still
find
the
court's
statement
ambiguous.
should
we
remand?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it
the
predominant
motivation?
the
motivation
is
to
create
a
majority
minority
district.
that
means
race.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what
you're
saying
is,
it's
okay
to
do
it
for
racial
purposes,
and
i...
and
you
and
i
are
both
assuming
that
the
racial
purpose
is
justified
by
the
voting
rights
act,
i
take
it,
or
at
least
by
the...
by
correcting
the
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
it's
okay
to
do
that
if
you
do
it
consistently
with
normal
districting
practices.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what...
aren't
you
assuming
that
what
determines
whether
it's
the
predominant
factor
or
not,
what
determines
whether
that
factor
is
treated
as
predominant
for
purposes
of
miller
and
shaw,
is
a
function
of
whether
it
is
created
consistently
with
districting
practices
as
traditionally
understood,
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
then
it's
not
predominant,
race
is
not
predominant
for
miller
purposes.
if
the
answer
is
no,
it
is.
i
understood
that
to
be
the
thrust
of
your
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
don't
see
why
you're
not
changing
the
miller
definition,
because
the
miller
definition
of
what
was
predominant
was
a
definition
that
considered
whether
the
racial
motivation
subordinated
the
application
of
traditional
districting
principles,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
definition
is
rejecting
the
miller
definition.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
we
all
recognize
that
sometimes...
that
race
is
going
to
be
used,
and
sometimes
it's
good,
and
sometimes
it's
bad,
and
we've
got
to
have
some
way
to
figure
out,
as
a
threshold
matter,
which
it
is,
and
miller
says
it's
predominant,
and
it's
going
to
trigger
strict
scrutiny,
if
it
subordinates
traditional
districting
practices.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that...
do
you
understand
miller
to
hold
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let
me
ask
you
the
next
question.
if
it
can
be
shown,
as
a
matter
of
historical
fact,
that
a
traditional
districting
practice
includes
incumbency
protection,
then
it
has
to
follow,
if
we're
going
to
follow
miller,
that
if
the
court
finds
that
incumbency
protection
was
the
reason
for
the
arms
and
the
squiggles,
then
it
cannot
follow
from
the
fact
of
arms
and
squiggles
that
the
motivation
was
predominantly
racial
within
the
meaning
of
miller.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
where
did
i
go
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
want
to
know.
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
was
a
good
answer.
[laughter]
is
that
your
answer?
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
let
me
ask
you
a
good
question.
[laughter]
if,
in
fact,
the
incumbency
protection
is
achieved
by
knowing
who
is
a
democrat,
and
by
drawing
the
lines
according
to
which
neighborhood
is
democratic
and
which
neighborhood
isn't,
then
the
fact
that
those
neighborhoods
are
democratic
happen
to
be
black,
and
therefore
the
arms
and
the
squiggles
end
up
including
black
voters
and
not
white
ones,
that's
not
wrong
on
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes
or
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes
or
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
wrong
or
not
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
lines
are
drawn
because
you're
getting
in
democrats,
the
fact
that
the
democrats
happen
to
be
black
is
not
going
to
disqualify
that
as
an
application
of
districting
practices,
and
it
won't
result
in
a
conclusion
that
the
racial
motive
was...
that
the
motive
was
predominantly
racial
within
miller.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
why
shouldn't
we
then
send
this
case
back
and
say
to
the
district
court,
tell
us
exactly,
based
on
the
evidence,
whether,
in
fact,
the
discriminations
that
were
made
here
were
made
based
on
political
data
which
happened
to
disclose
a
racial
composition,
or
whether
it
was
made
on
data
which
was
purely
racial,
and
used
merely
as
an
unthinking
surrogate
for
a
political
determination.
why
shouldn't
we
ask
them
to
make
that
discrimination
for
us,
and
on
which
the
case
would
turn?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
if
this
case...
let's
assume
that
this
judgment
stands,
and
they
have
the
same
objective,
and
for
the
sake
of
incumbency
protection
this
time
they
use
whatever
data
they've
got,
let's
say
precinct
level
data,
so
that
the
lines
are
not
going
to
be
quite
so
fine
but
you
still
get
a
funny
looking
shape
for
purposes
of
incumbency
protection,
and
your
incumbency
protection
data
is
entirely
political
democratic
data
or
republican
data
as
opposed
to
race,
and
it
ends
up
looking
something
like
this,
there
will
still
be
a
factual
correlation.
you
can
say,
well,
gee,
the
democrats
seem
to
be
black,
and
most
blacks
seem
to
be
democrats,
but
you
would
not
find
that
a
violation
of
the
shaw
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
it's
going
to
be
bona
fide,
sure.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
different...
i
guess
the
next
step
question.
let's
assume
that
the
political
correlation...
let's
assume
that
the
political
data
in
the
computer
about
prior
voting
patterns
is
going
to
be
a
basis
for
drawing
funny
lines,
for
making
these
adjustments,
and
the
purpose
is
incumbency
protection.
assume,
secondly,
that
you've
got
two
essentially
adjoining
democratic
districts.
no
matter
how
you
draw
the
lines,
1
and
2
are
both
going
to
be
democratic
districts,
and
they've
got
a
choice
between
drawing
the
lines
in
such
a
way
that
puts
a
lot
of
blacks
in
a
white
district
and
a
lot
of
whites
in
a
black
district.
and
somebody
says,
traditionally,
if
we
were
worried
about
the
feelings
between
the
french
and
the
irish,
we
draw
the
line
in
such
a
way
so
that
the...
most
of
the
french
could
be
in
a
predominantly
french
ward,
and
most
of
the
irish
could
be
in
a
predominantly
irish
ward.
now
we've
got
a
situation
in
which
instead
of
french
and
irish
it's
black
and
hispanic,
black
and
white.
can
they
do
the
same
thing
for
the
blacks
who
want
to
be
in
a
black
district
that
they
could
do
for
the
irish
in
the
old
days
who
wanted
to
be
in
an
irish
district?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it's
not
compact
in
the
sense
that
the
lines
are
nice.
they're
protecting
incumbents.
they
can
protect
democratic
incumbents
either
way,
and
they've
got
a
choice
between
doing
what
they
used
to
do
for
the
french
and
the
irish
or
the
poles
and
the
jews
or
whatever,
and
the
choice
is
now
doing
it
for
blacks
and
whites.
can
they
do
the
same
thing,
if,
in
fact,
there
is
such
a
tradition?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
can
they
still
do
it
for
the
french
and
the
irish,
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
one
rule
for
everybody.
no
more
of
this
kind
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
justice
breyer's
example
is
different
from
mine.
in
mine,
i'm
talking
about
making
the
irish
or
the
poles
or
the
jews
or
the
wasps
or
what
not
happy
to
be
together.
in
his,
the
sole
motivation
is
incumbency
protection.
why
isn't
your
answer
different
from
him
from
what
it
was
for
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
his
example
the
people...
st.
mary's
gets
in
not
because
they're
catholics
but
because
they're
democrats.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
knows
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
knows
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if,
in
fact,
the
court
says
they
only
wanted
the
st.
mary's
parish
in
there
because
they
were
democrats,
no
problem
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
mean,
if
that's
what
the
fact
finding
is,
that's
not...
that
is
not
suspect
on
your
theory,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
why,
then--
--but
what
if
they
were?
--isn't
your
answer
to
justice
stevens--
--yes,
but
what
if
they
were?
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
may
i
go
back
to
the
miller
definition.
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
that
if
the
motive
was
simply
to
create
a
majority
minority
district,
and
we
didn't
know
anything
more
than
that,
that
that
would,
in
fact,
be
unconstitutional.
now
let
me
add
something
to
what
we
know.
let
us
assume
that
in
creating
that
majority
minority
district,
number
1,
the
motive
was
to
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act,
and
number
2,
that
in
fact
the
district
shape
that
came
out
of
that
process
was
a
shape
which
was
consistent
with
the
shape
that
traditionally
gets
arrived
at
in
districts
when
traditional
districting
practices
are
followed,
as,
for
example,
in
justice
stevens'
case,
it
is
a
compact
district.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is...
if
those
three
facts
are
what
we
know,
is
it
fair
to
say
under
the
miller
definition
of
what
is
a
subordination
of
districting
to
race,
that
we
would
not
have
an
apparent
case
of
subordinated
districting
to
race?
that
would
be
okay
under
the
miller
definition,
and
it
would
not
trigger
strict
scrutiny.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
happens
if...
let's
assume...
all
right,
if
i
take
that
example,
then
it
seems
to
me
i
am
varying
miller,
because
miller
didn't
say
that
any
use
of
race,
whether
for
compliance
of
section
2
or
any
other,
is
wrong.
miller
says
it's
only
wrong
when
it
is
subordinated
to
traditional
districting
practices.
miller
puts
a
limitation
on
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answers
to
us
do
not
recognize
that
limitation,
so
that
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you,
the
court
would
have
to
expand
miller.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
that's
not
what
miller
says,
is
it?
miller
says
that
it's
predominant
if
it
subordinates
traditional
districting
practices
to
race,
and
i
think
what
you're
saying
is,
whenever
you
start
out
with
the
motive
of
creating
a
majority
minority
district,
you
in
fact
trigger
strict
scrutiny,
and
by
definition
you
have
always...
you
have
subordinated
every
other
consideration
to
race.
is
that
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
isn't
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
no,
no,
let's
assume
you
don't
abandon
them.
you
end
up
with
a
compact...
we
get
into
court.
the
redistricting
is
done.
you've
got
a
compact
district.
it
goes
back
to
justice
stevens'
question.
the
traditional
districting
principles
have,
in
fact,
apparently
been
honored
here.
strict
scrutiny
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
think...
is
it
fair
to
say,
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--oh,
i
grant
you
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
fair
to
say,
then,
that
you
are
in
fact
asking
us
to
recognize
a
cause
of
action
which
is
broader
than
miller
recognized,
because
otherwise
that
language
in
miller
did
not
mean
what
it
said.
it
was
in
fact
a
misspeaking
by
the
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
miller
says,
in
deciding
whether
it
is
predominant
or
not,
you
look
to
whether
it
has
excluded
the
application
of
traditional
districting
principles.
if
it
hasn't
excluded
it,
then
either
it
isn't
predominant,
or
you've
got
a
pretty
tough
row
to
hoe
to
show
that
it
is,
and
you're
saying,
never
mind
whether
the
result
is
consistent
with
traditional
districting
principles
or
not,
and
that's
why
i
say
i
think
you're
asking
us
to
expand
on
miller.
