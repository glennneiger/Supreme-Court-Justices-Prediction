justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you're
saying
that
this
case
cannot
involve
a
question
of
lawfulness
versus
unlawfulness,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
because
this
is
not
a
case
involving
the
application
of
an
off
limits
consideration,
the
issue
here
cannot
be
an
issue,
whether
it
was
lawful
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
start
with
the
premise
that
it
was
lawful,
and
you
say,
within
the
realm
of
lawfulness,
what
can
it
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that...
i
mean,
your
case,
then,
is
really
not
so
much
a
case
about
what
the
standard
ought
to
be,
it's
a
case
that's
going
to
turn
on
whether
we
agree
with
you
that
in
fact
there
can
be
a
lawfulness
versus
unlawfulness
decision
about
particular
factors
or
reasons
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
couldn't
we
see
the
case
that
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
reason
that
this
is
an...
as
it
were,
is
an
easy
issue
as
you
see
it
is
that
there
cannot
be
an
issue
of
law
here.
this
has
got
to
be
viewed
as
an
issue
of
discretion.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
suppose
that
if
we
all
agree
with
you
there,
there
isn't
very
much
left
to
argue
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
are
also
saying
that
there
can
be
no
unusualness
question
which
raises
an
issue
of
law
as
distinct
from
an
issue
of
discretion,
and
the
reason
it
cannot
raise
an
issue
of
law
is
that
the
only
issues
of
law
are
issues
involving
whether
something
has
been
explicitly
taken
off
the
table
or
not.
is
that
a
fair--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
is
it
understanding
of
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
as
to
them,
de
novo
standard.
easy,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
what
we're
getting
at
by
de
novo
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
they
did
it
wrong,
but
just
as
an
abstract
matter,
i
think
what
you
are
describing
as
the
standard
is
what
we
normally
describe
as
a
de
novo
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
was
no
description
by,
as
i
understand
it
by
the
judge
in
this
case
of
any
factor
other
than
the
successive
prosecution.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
no,
but
that's
on
a
different
point...
a
different
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
help
me
in
the
facts.
didn't
the
judge
separately
consider
the
successiveness
of
the
prosecution
and
the
vulnerability
to
abuse
in
prison?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
would
it
not
be
correct,
then,
on
just
the
analysis
that
you
gave
to
justice
breyer,
to
send
the
thing
back
and
say,
well,
as
a
matter
of
law,
having
given
no
separate
reason
going
solely
to
successive
prosecution
than
the
fact
that
there
was
a
successive
prosecution,
as
a
matter
of
law
it
was
wrong
to
consider
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
maybe
it
was
not
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
therefore
subject
to
a
different
standard
of
review,
that
these
particular
defendants
would
be
especially
vulnerable?
wouldn't
that
be
a
proper
way...
couldn't
that
be
a
proper
way
to
dispose
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
why
doesn't
that
argue
for
the
answer
that
sometimes
it
does
and
sometimes
it
doesn't,
sometimes
it
reveals
a
clear
issue
of
law,
sometimes
it
reveals
a
mixed
issue
which
would
get
a
more
deferential
standard?
