justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
olson,
let
me
ask
about
the
first
point
that
you
make
in
your
argument,
and
which
i
guess
you're
coming
to
now,
whether
in
deciding
this
question
we
use
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
or
we
decide
de
novo
whether
the
particular
factor
is
allowable
under
the
guidelines.
does
it
really
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
what
is
being
contended
by
the
government
is
that
certain
of
these
factors
are
not
lawful
factors,
that
the
guidelines
do
not
permit
them
to
be
used.
now,
if
we
reviewed
it
de
novo,
we
would
come
to
the
conclusion,
assuming
the
government's
right,
you're
right,
the
guidelines
do
not
permit
them
to
be
used.
if
we
did
it
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
we
would
say,
well,
of
course
it
is
always
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
violate
the
law,
and
therefore
we
have
before
us
the
same
question
does
the
guidelines
permit
it
to
be
used?
whichever
standard
you
use,
the
appellate
court
has
the
same
question
before
it
is
it
lawful
to
use
this
particular
factor?
i
don't
see
why
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--should
bother
fighting
about
what
standard
to
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
you're
missing
my
point.
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
simply
says,
within
this
broad
range
of
the
unlawful
on
this
side
and
the
unlawful
on
that
side,
the
court
can
do
whatever
it
wants
in
the
middle.
now,
when
it
goes
into
the
unlawful,
it
automatically
abuses
its
discretion,
and
the
contention
here
is
that
certain
factors
cannot
lawfully
be
considered.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
i'm
willing
to
decide
it
that
way,
but
i'm
going
to
be
asking
myself
the
same
question.
is
it
lawful
to
consider
this
factor?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
question,
whether
a
particular
factor
that
could
in
some
circumstances
be
used
should
have
been
used
in
this
case,
and
i
will
acknowledge,
and
i
don't
think
the
government
contests
that
that
is
subject
to
abuse
of
discretion.
but
the
question
of
whether
the
factor
is
ever
allowable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now
you're
arguing
the
merits,
and
that's
a
different
question.
that's
not
the
standard
question,
that's
the
merits
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i'm
happy
to
discuss
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kopeny,
don't
waste
time
on
that.
let's
get
to
the
merits
of
the
thing.
you've
got
20
minutes
gone.
we've
got
10
minutes
to
talk
about
the
legal
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
which
portion
was
attributable
to
aggravated
assault
and
which
was
attributable
to
the
violation
of
civil
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
assault
cases?
are
there
a
lot
of
assault
cases
in
the
district
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
factor
of
provocation
was
used
in
this
case
to
reduce
the
assault
portion
of
the
punishment,
not
the
civil
rights
violation
portion
of
the
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
call
it
a
component.
it
was
that
component
that
was
reduced,
and
certainly
unusualness
with
regard
to
assault
cases
is
really
what
should
be
relevant
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
are
determinations
of
the
facts,
whether
he
was
minor,
major,
or
whatnot.
i
mean,
to
convey
that
meaning
i
would
have
said,
and
shall
give
due
deference
to
the
district
court's
determination
of
the
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
determination
of
the
facts.
which
is
in
another
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says,
application
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
say
about
petitioner's
contention
that
that
is
no
different
from
the
level
of
charging
offense?
maybe
the
court
shouldn't
have
used
the
word
unfair,
but
where
a
court
departs
because
it
thinks
that
a
lesser
offense
should
have
been
charged?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
perfectly
lawful
for
the
government
to
make
the
higher
charge,
but
in
fact
the
court
thought
it
was
unfair,
use
whatever
word
you
like.
why
is
that
any
different
from
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
simply
contest
the
factual
accuracy
of
the
contention--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
a
departure
is
permitted--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
court
thinks
that
a
different
or
lower
charge
should
have
been
brought.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
won't
be
resolved
consistently.
i
mean,
let
us
not
exaggerate
the
kind
of
consistency
you're
going
to
get.
even
if
you
decide
it's
a
permissible
factor,
you're
going
to
have
some
judges
who
are
going
to
say,
in
my
courtroom...
i
know
it's
permissible,
but
in
my
courtroom
i'm
not
going
to
use
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
have
a
great
deal
of
divergence
in
the
district
courts
anyway,
so
i
mean,
let
us
not
paint
the
picture
that
we're
going
to
get
uniform
nationwide
sentencing.
we
certainly
aren't.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
merely...
merely...
the
fact
that
we
pronounce
something
to
be
permissible
does
not
make
it
mandatory,
and
as
long
as
it's
permissible
but
not
mandatory,
you're
going
to
get
a
lot
of
variation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
hard
to
do,
though,
because
as
we've
established,
the
court
is
not
going
to
say
to
the
district
court,
you
should,
much
less
you
must,
depart
downward
because
of
the
3-year-old.
they're
just
going
to
say,
you
may
if
you
want,
and
you're
going
to
have
the
same
kind
of
diversity
anyway.
i
don't
understand
how
this
common
law
consistency
is
going
to
build
up
by
this
decision
of
law
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
far
from
perfect,
there
won't
be
any
consistency
at
all
if
they're
just
saying
this
is
one
of
the
myriad
factors
you
can
use.
if
you
want
to
use
it,
use
it,
if
you
don't
want
to
use
it,
don't
use
it.
