mr.
william
j.
kopeny
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
question
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
as
to
petitioner
powell
included
a
second
question
and
that
was,
what
was
the
correct
analysis
of
the
departure
in
this
case,
and
i
take
it
that
this
court
would
not
conclude
its
decision
in
this
case
by
simply
saying
what
the
name
of
the
standard
of
review
is
for
reviewing
departures,
particularly
because
it
is
the...
at
the
core
of
the
dispute
between
the
parties
in
this
case
is
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
went
about
applying
what
it
called
the
de
novo
standard
and
the
way
that
the
parties
contend
the
reviewing
court
should
proceed.
the
opinion
in
rivera
as
i
read
it
states
that
there
is
an
initial
pure
question
of
law
which
is
to
be
decided,
but
it's
to
be
decided
as
i
think
justice
souter
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
burns
case,
without
regard
to
the
evidence
or
facts
of
the
case.
that
is
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
reviewing
court
or
a
district
court
can
tell
whether
a
particular
factor
was
either
taken
into
account
or
adequately
taken
into
account
by
the
guidelines
commission,
and
that
there
are,
as
justice
breyer
said
in
the
rivera
opinion,
questions
of
interpretation
of
words
or
formulas
of
words
in
statutes
and
guidelines
which
circuit
courts
or
reviewing
courts
are
equally
competent
to
determine
to
district
courts.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
words
that
justice
breyer
used
was
plenary
standard,
but
what's
important,
i
think,
is
that--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--well,
i
hesitate
to
use
the
word
de
novo,
because
the
ninth
circuit
called
what
it
did
in
this
case
de
novo,
but
reached
a
conclusion
which
justice
o'connor
said
in
williams
was
forbidden
to
the
reviewing
court,
and
that
is
to
determine
whether
it
was
an
appropriate--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--i
think
so,
too.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
i
agree
with
you.
however,
i
am
urging
the
court
not
to
simply
stop
at
the
label.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there's
a
two
step
process,
and
that
clearly
any
reviewing
court
must
start,
as
i
think
rivera
instructs,
with
a
first
step
which
is
properly
called
plenary,
or
de
novo.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
right.
your
honor,
my
concern
is
this,
that
by
calling
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here
de
novo,
we're
either
changing
the
meaning
of
it
or
we're
not
agreeing
on
terms,
because--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--well,
your
honors,
i
think
the
legal
issues
with
regard
to
the...
whether
these
are
valid
bases
for
departure
are
clearly
before
this
court
as
well.
it's
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
government
makes
a
mistake
of
law
in
concluding,
for
example,
that
the
5-level
departure
in
this
case
was
invalid,
as
a
matter
of
law,
because
victim
misconduct
could
not,
as
a
matter
of
law
apply
in
this
sort
of
case--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--because
the
police
officers
were
the
defendants.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
in
18
u.s.c.
3742(e),
there
is
a
reasonableness
standard,
but
as
i
understand
at
least
justice
souter's
dissent
in
burns,
that
means
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
if,
in
fact,
you
could
conclude
that
there's
a
range
of
sentences
that
would
be
appropriate
but
none
was
righter
than
another,
then
anyone
within
that
range
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court,
according
to
the--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--i
don't
know
that
he
has
an
obligation
to
contrast
it
with
other
potential
departures,
but
he
does
have
an
obligation
to
find
that
it's
unusual,
to
describe
the
degree
to
which
it's
present,
and
the
guidelines
are
very
specific
in
5k2.10
with
the
six
factors
that
he
must
evaluate,
and
in
this
case
there
was
a
very
specific
sentencing
memorandum
by
judge
davies,
the
district
judge,
who...
in
which
he
went
through
chapter
and
verse
of
the
findings
of
which
of
those
factors
were
present
and
to
what
degree.
he
talked
about
the
persistence
of
the
misconduct.
he
talked
about
the
reasonableness
of
the
fear,
and
how
it
was
provocative.
he
spoke
specifically
about
how
the
victim
in
this
case,
after
being
tased
and
put
to
the
ground,
rose
up
and
charged
at
my
client,
petitioner
powell,
and
putting
him
in
reasonable
fear,
because
he
was
an
unsearched
felony
suspect
at
that
time.
he
said
that
these
things
preceded
only
by
seconds
the
offense
conduct,
which...
and
that
therefore
there
was
a
relationship
of
substantially
contributing
to
provoking
the
offense
conduct,
and
i
urge
the
court
to
reject
again,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
government's
claim
that
the
lack
of
contemporaneous
provocation
and
offense
conduct
means
that
this
was
an
inappropriate
guideline
to
use,
that
is,
the
encouraged
departure
downward
for
misconduct
by
the
victim.
however,
there
is
a
point
here
that
i
think
is
essential
to
the
court's
resolution
of
this
legal
question,
and
that
is
this.
as
i
read
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
guidelines,
there
is
a
compartmentalizing
of
the
various
elements.
for
example,
in
any
police
misconduct
case,
whether
it's
conspiracy
to
violate
someone's
right
to
vote,
or
whether
it's
assaulting
someone
and
using
unreasonable
force,
the
guidelines
gives
a
formula
for
addressing
punishment
to
that
element
of
the
crime.
but
there's
really
a
fact
based
analysis
here
which
sort
of
prevents
the
government
from
drastically
changing
the
sentence
by
changing
what
charges
it
files,
so
that
the
offense
conduct
element
in
this
case
is
15
elements,
15
levels
of
sentencing
for
the
aggravated
assault.
i
take
it
that
the
government's
argument
should
be
rejected
that
in
a
police
misconduct
case
you
can
never
give...
you
can
never
find
victim
misconduct
mitigating
because
all
the
judge
did
was
find
that
the
departure
downward
for
victim
misconduct
applied
to
that
15
levels
of
aggravated
assault.
in
other
words,
i
think
there
is
a
limit
on
that
discretion,
your
honor,
that
if
judge
davies
had
gone
16
or
more
levels,
and
cut
into
the
punishment
for
the
violation
of
civil
rights
rather
than
simply
reduced
by
a
third
the
element
of
the
punishment
in
this
case
that
addressed
the
aggravated
assault,
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
fairly
strong
argument
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
finding
the
degree
of
departure
to
exceed
that
which
was
the
predicate
for
the
departure,
that
is,
the
assault
itself.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
guidelines
are
clear
and
specific
about
it.
in
this
case,
if
there
had
been
no
aggravated
assault
there
would
have
been
10
levels
attributable
to
civil
rights.
however...
to
civil
rights
violation.
however,
because
the
resulting
offense
level
is
higher,
there
were
15
for
aggravated
assault
and
6
for
the
civil
rights
violation,
so
we
know
that
the
departure
of
5
is
well
within
the
aggravated
assault
component
of
the
sentencing.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
no,
we
don't,
and--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--justice
breyer,
if
you're
referring
to
the
3-level
combination
departure
and
not
including
the
discussion
of
the
5
levels
for
victimless
conduct,
then
yes,
i
think
your
honor
is
right
that
the
analysis
of
that
would
require
the
court
to
have
due
regard
for
the
facts
and
to
defer
to
those
aspects,
or
those
factors
under
the
added
punishment
departure
that
were
experiential
and
related
to
what
a
district
judge
could
do.
but
where
there's
a
pure
question
of
law,
then
i
think
that
a
circuit
court
might
be
able
to
determine
it
was
an
inappropriate
factor.
however,
i
would
urge
caution
in
the
two
that
the
government
have
made
their
strongest
points
on.
one
is
this
lack
of
recidivism
being
prohibited,
and
the
other
is
the
one
about
the
government
making
a
charging
decision
to
prosecute
these
defendants
again
after
they'd
been
prosecuted
in
the
state
court.
as
i've
indicated
in,
i
believe
the
reply,
petitioner's
reply
brief,
the
guidelines
do
address
the
question
of
when
the
court
thinks
its
unfair
that
the
government
has
made
a
particular
charging
decision
and
suggests
that
that
might
be
addressed
by
a
departure.
so
even
though
it's
legal,
completely
legal
for
the
government
to
choose
one
charge
offense
over
another,
if
the
government...
if
the
court
in
its
experience
detects
a
specter
of
unfairness,
the
guidelines
encourages
a
district
judge
to
depart
downward
based
on
that
sense
of
unfairness,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
reach
too
quickly
the
conclusion
that,
because
double
jeopardy
is
not
violated
here,
there
is
no
specter
of
unfairness
which
a
district
judge
is
uniquely
qualified
to
detect,
and
which
the
guidelines
would
prohibit,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
district
judge
considering
in
the
mix
with
all
the
other
combined
factors
in
determining
that
that
unfairness
should
be
addressed
by
a
departure.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
oh,
to
the
contrary,
your
honor,
there
was
a
description
of
the
defendants'
extreme
vulnerability
in
prison,
there
was
a
description--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--no,
it's
on
the
same
point,
because
there
was
a
single
3-level
departure--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--for
a
combination
of
factors.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
no,
your
honor.
the
circuit
court
separately
considered.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
and
that's
what
justice
reinhardt...
judge
reinhardt
said
was
an
improper
divide
and
conquer
approach.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--no,
it
couldn't,
and
perhaps
it's
because...
i
misunderstood
your
former
question,
but
the
judge,
the
district
judge
did
discuss
individually
each
of
the
factors
that
he
said
was
in
the
mix
that
gave
rise
to
the
combination
3-level
departure.
and
he
laid
on
the
record
specific
reasons
why
he
thought
that
was
unfair
and
why
he
thought
there
should
be
a
departure
in
this
case.
so
it
wouldn't
be
right
to
remand
because
he
failed
to
do
what
the
outline
of
the
guidelines,
or
the
framework
says
he
must
do,
which
is
to
give
reasons
and
to
make
the...
draw
the
conclusion
that
it's
unusual.
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
well,
i'm
sure,
as
your
honor
knows,
you've
already
answered--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--you've
already
answered
that
precise
question
in
williams--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--because
that
was
the
issue
before
the
court,
and
then
i
take
it
there's
no
dispute
about
the...
no
one's
asked
this
court
to
reconsider
its
conclusions
about
the
procedure
to
follow.
if
your
honor
concludes
that
one--
mr.
william
j.
kopeny
--but
not
all
of
the
bases
for
departure
is
invalid.
however,
there
is
a
distinction,
and
that
is
this.
each
of
these
combined
factors
went
into
some...
into
a
combination
or
mix
factor,
and
this
court
has
never
determined
that
once
one
valid
factor
is
considered,
that
it
is
inappropriate
for
the
district
judge
to
be
straitjacketed
into
not
considering
the
whole
of
the
remainder
of
the
case
in
determining
to
what
degree
departure
is
appropriate.
in
other
words,
where
the
judge
says,
as
in
williams,
or
for
example
there's...
this
is
not
a
combination
departure,
but
there's
a
departure,
and
here
are
the
three
separate
reasons,
then
i
think
the
remand
might
be
required,
or
obviously
will
be.
but
where
the
judge
says,
i
think
an
additional
3-level
departure
is
appropriate,
and
these
are
the
factors
that
i'm
identifying
in
combination,
that
it
isn't
clear
that
it
would
be
illegal
or,
as
a
matter
of
law,
invalid
for
a
judge
to
consider
the
whole
of
the
case,
even
though
some
of
those
factors,
if
articulated
separately,
would
be
prohibited.
so
i
think
that
there
is
still
some
more
work
to
do
in
drawing
the
inference
that
this
case
fits
under
williams,
because
it's
different
in
that
regard.
and
i
think
it's
also
correct
to
say
that
when
we
look
at
the
other
factor,
take
the
question
of
recidivism,
it
seems
right
that
at
least
in
the
ninth
circuit
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided
it
was
the
law
that
if
a
person
is
in
category
1
with
criminal
history,
you
can't
depart
downward
because
you
find
that
he
won't
reoffend.
it
also...
and
therefore
the
government
argues
that's
a
prohibited
factor.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
not
clear
that
that
is
all
that
judge
davies
was
doing
in
discussing
the
fact
that
as
part
of
the
mix,
these
defendants
were
not
likely
to
be
a
danger
to
anyone,
and
that's
because
in
reviewing
the
reasonableness
of
a
departure
the
statute
says,
37...
well,
3742(e)(3)
says
that
it's
only
in
determining
whether
the
departure
is
unreasonable
that
the
reviewing
court
should
look
at
those
purposes
of
sentencing.
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
sentencing
is
protection
of
society,
so
it's
a
fair
thing
for
the
district
judge
to
talk
about
whether
or
not
these
defendants
or
this
defendant
would
be
a
danger
in
discussing
the
justification
for
a
particular
departure
and
the
level
of
it.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
how
this
district
judge's
findings
are
read,
but
it
is
not
clear
that
he
used
an
improper
factor,
rather,
that
he
included
in
the
mix
something
which
the
guidelines
require
to
be
given
regard
to,
and
that
is,
whether
the
person
is
a
danger,
because
obviously
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
set
a
dangerous
person
loose,
whereas
it
might
be
more
reasonable
to
give
a
person
who
is
totally
not
dangerous
a
lower
sentence,
so
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
whether
it's
reasonable.
thank
you
very
much.
