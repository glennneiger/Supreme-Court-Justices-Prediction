justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
say
that
so
positively?
aren't
there
varieties
of
prior
proceedings
that
might
pose...
one
impose
an
extreme
burden
on
a
defendant,
another
be
a
very
trivial
burden?
there
are
differences
among...
within
a
category
like
that
that
might
require
some
judgment
as
to
whether
it
should
affect
the
ultimate
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
if
he
had
huge
expenses,
monetary
expenses,
might
not
that
bear
on
the
amount
of
the
fine
that
should
be
imposed,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
should
never
bear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
in
the
category
of
sometimes.
you
can
say,
aw,
it
was
never
or
sometimes.
