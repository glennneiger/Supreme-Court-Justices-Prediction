mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
our
position
is
that
the
issue
of
whether
a
particular
factor
may
warrant
a
departure
from
the
guidelines
is
a
legal
issue
that
is
subject
to
de
novo
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
there
are
two
main
reasons
for
that
position.
first,
a
proposed
ground
for
departure
raises
recurring
issues
which
are
fit
for
and
benefit
from
plenary
appellate
review
to
establish
consistent
and
coherent
standards
i
the
interpretation
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
and
second--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
are...
there
is
a
statute
that
specifically
addresses
the
standard
of
review
for
sentencing
guidelines--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
statute
that
governs
this,
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
6a
of
the
appendix,
provides
that
the
court
of
appeals
shall
give
due
regard
to
the
opportunity
of
the
district
court
to
judge
the
credibility
of
witnesses
and
shall
accept
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
unless
they
are
clearly
erroneous,
which
is,
of
course,
the
typical
standard
of
review
for
findings
of
fact,
and
shall
give
due
deference
to
the
district
court's
application
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts,
and
there
are
two
significant
points
i'd
like
to
make
about
the
last
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
supreme--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--let
me,
if
i
may,
justice
breyer,
address
the
statutory
point
that
you
raised
and
then
turn
to
the
policy
consideration
of
what
a
district
court
should
do
and
what
a
court
of
appeals
should
do.
this
court
held
in
williams
v.
united
states
that
the
reasonableness
determination
and
the
component
of
the
statute
that
you
read
that
refers
to
that
goes
only
to
the
second
step
of
whether
a
resulting
sentence
is
an
unreasonably
high
or
low
departure
from
the
guidelines.
it
only
goes
to
magnitude.
the
question
of
whether
a
departure
is
permissible
in
the
first
place
raises
two
antecedent
issues.
the
first
is
whether
it
is
a
violation
of
law,
which
it
would
be
if,
for
example,
a
district
court
departed
based
on
an
explicitly
socioeconomic
factor,
or
a
factor
that
is
so
close
to
a
socioeconomic
factor
as
to
be
a
proxy
for
it.
the
second
issue
of
law
that
is
antecedent
to
the
reasonableness
determination
is
whether
there
is
a
misapplication
of
the
guidelines
which
could
occur,
for
example,
as
the
court
made
clear
again
in
the
williams
opinion,
if
the
district
court
relied
on
a
factor
that
the
sentencing
commission
has
explicitly
taken
into
consideration
and
has
given
adequate
consideration
to.
so
in
those
two--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
certainly
wouldn't
say
they
should
pay
no
attention
whatsoever--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the
key
factor
is
what
they
think
is
unusual
will
stem
from
the
experience
that
they
derive
from
their
courtrooms
hearing
the
particular
cases
that
come
across
their
dockets.
where
the
court
of
appeals
have
a
distinct
advantage
in
that
respect
is
the
ability
to
harmonize
the
results
that
are
obtained
in
different
district
courts
throughout
the
circuit,
which
may
have
very
different
circumstances.
a
family
circumstance
that
a
district
judge
in
manhattan
may
think
is
a
ground
for
departure
may
be
entirely
different
from
one
that
a
judge
sitting
in
hartford,
connecticut
would
think.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
government
has
no
quarrel
with
the
general
approach
you're
suggesting
of
a
common
law
development
of
unusualness.
when
the
guidelines
do
not
give
specific
guidelines
on
how
a
departure
factor
is
to
be
applied,
and
there
is
not
a
statutory
prescription
or
a
policy
underlying
the
sentencing
statutes
that
would
preclude
taking
the
departure--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i...
well,
there
are
several
reasons
why
i
do
not
think
that
there
should
have
been
any
deference
given
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
district
courts
happen
to
see
a
very,
very
small
sampling
of
civil
rights
cases
because
there
are
few
of
them
in
the
federal
system,
so
that
the
idea
that
a
particular
district
judge
is
going
to
develop
substantial
expertise
at
gauging
them
is
probably
not
an
experientially
correct
judgment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
courts
of
appeals
would
have
the
ability
to
do
what
courts
of
appeals
do
best,
which
is
to
evaluate
the
policies
underlying
the
particular
guideline
provisions
that
were
applied,
and
we
think
there
are
legal
issues
that
govern
the
victim
misconduct
issue
in
this
case,
and
take
the
time
to
go
through
the
body
of
reported
cases
and
other
sources
of
law
that
would
help
illuminate
the
question
of
what
typically
is
found
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
there
are
a
lot
of
assault
cases
in
the
district
courts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
in
itself
was
an
error
of
law,
justice
scalia,
because
the
guidelines
themselves
provide
that
the
departure
question,
whether
a
guidelines
sentence
should
be
departed
from,
is
the
last
step
in
the
process
after
all
of
the
other
factors
have
been
put
into
the
mix,
and
in
this
case
the
only
guideline
that
was
applicable
to
determine
ultimately
what
the
base
offense
level
was
for
these
defendants
was
the
civil
rights
guideline,
which
refers
to
another
guideline
and
incorporates
that
guideline
only
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
component.
a
departure
that
would
be
made
solely--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
first
of
all,
that
raises
the
legal
issue
of
what
should
the
proper
comparison
group
of
typical
cases
be?
in
the
government's
view,
when
your
violate...
when
you
violate
18
u.s.c.
242
through
an
excessive
force
violation
and
you
are
sentenced
by
the...
under
the
guideline
applicable
to
that
civil
rights
violation,
the
heartland
of
typical
cases
must
be
defined
with
reference
to
that
civil
rights
violation
and
not
assaults
that
are
committed
by
private
persons
which
have
very
different
situations.
it
was
undisputed
in
the
district
court
that
the
kind
of
pursuit
and
eventual
arrest
that
occurred
in
this
case
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
police
officers
typically
encounter
every
day.
police
officers
typically
encounter
suspects
who
resist
arrest,
who
use
various
forms
of
violence,
who
are
provocative
in
the
common
sense,
and
police
officers
are
trained
to
respond
to
that
and
to
do
so
without
stepping
the
line,
over
the
line
into
excessive
force
and
constitutional
violations
which--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--certainly.
there
is
an
adjustment
that
applies
under
the
guidelines
to
the
base
offense
level
depending
on
what
role
in
the
offense
the
defendant
had.
was
he
a
leader?
was
he
a
manager?
was
he
a
minimal
participant?
was
he
a
minor
participant?
there
are
guidelines
that
address
those
issues.
there
are
application
notes
that
give
examples
of
how
those
guidelines
are
to
be
applied,
and
when
a
district
court
makes
the
determination
that
this
defendant
was
a
minimal
participant,
this
defendant
was
a
minor
participant,
those
determinations
are
applications
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
whether--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
that
is
an
application
of
the
guidelines,
justice
scalia.
there
is
not
a
fact
that
somebody
was
a
minor
participant
or
minimal
participant.
those
are
legal
labels
that
are
attached
to
particular
conduct
and
that
provide
a
basis
for
a
district
court
to
impose
a
different
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
particular
context
that
we're
dealing
with
here
today
are
departures
from
the
guidelines.
departures
were
not
intended
to
be
the
norm.
they
are
in
a
sense
disfavored.
they
are
to
be
granted
in
unusual
cases
when
the
circumstances
were
not
taken
into
account
by
the
sentencing
commission.
for
almost
all
of
the
departure
factors
that
the
district
court
relied
on
in
this
case,
there
was
no
guideline
that
was
applicable
that
gave
him
any
sort
of
guidance
on
how
to
adjust
a
particular
sentence,
and
as
a
result,
it
is
only
in
a
technical
sense
that
the
district
judge
applied
the
guidelines
at
all.
what
he
really
found
was,
incorrectly
in
our
view,
that
certain
factors
had
not
been
taken
into
account
in
the
guidelines,
and
that
other
factors,
though,
were
not
only
unusual
but
that
they
should
result
in
a
departure
from
the
sentence,
such
as
the
fact
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
had
been
tried
in
a
california
court
for
assault
and
acquitted.
and
the
federal
government
then
made
a
determination
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
had
committed
federal
civil
rights
violations,
and
they
should
therefore
be
tried
for
those,
and
that
kind
of
a
factor
is
clearly
not
something
that's
taken
into
account
in
the
guidelines
in
any
sort
of
explicit
sense,
but
in
our
view
it's
the
sort
of
unusual
factor
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
sentencing
to
consider.
the
fact
that
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
our
view
would
be
it
should
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
let
me
make
a
distinction
with
respect
to
the
way
the
district
court
used
that
factor,
because
i
think
it's
important
for
this
case.
the
district
court
in
this
case
did
not
say
that
because
the
defendants
had
suffered
the
burdens
of
a
trial
in
another
jurisdiction
i
believe
that
they
have
already
been
punished
for
their
offenses
in
a
way
that
mitigates
the
need
to
punish
them
here.
the
district
court
instead
relied
on
two
other
factors,
the
fact
that
they
would
lose
their
jobs,
and
that
they
might
be
abused
in
prison,
under
its
further
punishment
rubric.
for
this
factor,
the
district
court
made
a
categorical
qualitative
judgment
that
it
raised
a
specter
of
unfairness
for
the
defendants
to
be
tried
in
two
proceedings,
and
in
our
view
that
raises
a
pure
question
of
law.
can
a
district
court
say,
it
is
unfair
for
the
united
states
to
attempt
to
vindicate
federal
civil
rights
laws
by
bringing
an
independent
prosecution?
to
allow
district
courts
to
use
such
words
as,
i
think
this
was
unfair,
is
a
wholesale
invitation
to
the
kind
of
unguided,
disparate
sentencing
that
congress
intended
to
remedy
through
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
i
believe
that
the
most
straightforward
answer
to
you
is
that
that
is
wrong.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
was
a
prevalent
view
before
this
court
decided
williams
v.
united
states,
but
at
page
200
of
503
united
states
reports,
the
court
made
clear
that
it
can
be
an
incorrect
application
of
the
guidelines
to
rely
on
a
factor...
and
i'll
quote
here...
to
depart
from
the
applicable
sentencing
range
based
on
a
factor
that
the
commission
has
already
fully
considered
in
establishing
the
guidelines
range.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
i
would
submit
that
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
a
factor--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
does,
but
it's
certainly
true
that
a
district
court
can
make
a
mistake
in
believing
a
case
is
unusual
based
on
a
factor
that,
in
fact,
the
commission
did
consider.
but
the
important
point
for
us
here,
i
think,
is
that
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
second
determination
that
a
court
of
appeals
must
make...
and
i'll
quote
again.
it
says,
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
departure
is
not
the
result
of
an
error
in
interpreting
the
guidelines,
it
should
proceed
to
the
second
step.
is
the
resulting
sentence
an
unreasonably
high
or
low
departure
from
the
relevant
guidelines
sentencing
range?
if
so,
a
remand
is
required
under
3742(f)(2).
that's
at
page
202.
what
williams
did
was
draw
a
distinction
between
errors
of
law
that
can
infect
a
departure
and
the
question
of
whether
it
is
unreasonable,
which
the
williams
court
made
clear
is
unreasonably
high
or
unreasonably
low,
and
i
would
agree
with
you
entirely
that
once
a
district
court
relies
on
a
permissible
factor
that
is
legally
within
its
ken
to
consider
in
departing,
that
the
extent
of
the
departure
is
subject
to
deferential
review
on
appeal
under
the
reasonableness
component
of
the
statute,
and
it
probably
will
not
be
often
set
aside
unless
the
district
court
explicitly
regards
some
form
of
guidance
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
themselves
give.
but
it
is
not
the
case
that
simply
because
a
factor
was
not
given
adequate
consideration
by
the
sentencing
commission
that
the
courts
have
found
that
it
thereby
licenses
district
courts
to
depart.
one
factor
that
is,
i
think,
very
clear
in
this
case
is
the
one
that
we've
been
talking
about
with
respect
to
the
specter
of
unfairness
resulting
from
dual
prosecutions.
certainly,
the
commission
did
not
consider
that,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
it
justifies
a
departure,
and
the
question
of
whether
it
does
or
does
not
justify
a
departure,
namely
whether
we
are
right
or
wrong,
is
clearly
a
question
of
law
that
should
not
be
within
the
bounds
of
district
courts
to
resolve
differently.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
would
appeal,
and
i
think
we
would
prevail,
on
arguing
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
criticize
the
government's
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
in
determining
what
the
charge
is.
we
have
had
cases
that
are
almost
exactly
like
that,
where
defendants
have
claimed,
in
the
district
of
columbia,
that
the
united
states
attorney's
office
could
have
brought
this
case
across
the
street
in
the
superior
court,
and
if
they
had
done
that,
the
defendant
would
only
be
exposed
to
the
sentence
of
2
years.
but
because
the
united
states
attorney
exercised
charging
discretion
to
bring
the
case
in
federal
court,
the
defendant
was
subject
to
a
mandatory
minimum
of
5
years,
or
10
years,
or
what
have
you,
and
district
courts
have
departed
downwards,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversed
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
because
it
intrudes
upon
the
discretion
of
the
government
to
make
a
selection
as
to
what
charges
it
will
bring
in
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct,
and
the
court
may
disagree
with
me
on
that,
but
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
court
does
so,
it
is
disagreeing
with
me
on
an
issue
of
law
which
should
be
for
the
court
to
resolve
de
novo
and
not
for
a
district
court
to
be
able
to
have
the
right
to
say,
in
my
courtroom,
if
the
jury
recommends
leniency,
i
am
automatically
going
to
lower
the
defendant's
sentence,
and
for
another
district
judge
to
say,
sentencing
is
solely
my
legal
responsibility,
and
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
whether
a
jury
recommends
leniency
or
not.
in
our
view,
those
are
the
kinds
of
issues
that
under
a
guidelines
sentencing
system
should
be
resolved
consistently,
and
those
kinds
of
issues
arise
with
remarkable
frequency.
we
cite
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement.
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
in
a
sense
a
compromise
between
competing
values.
there
is
a
recognition
that
the
district
courts
should
have
discretion
imposing
sentences
within
the
sentencing
ranges
themselves,
or
one
particular
district
judge
may
say,
i
always
sentence
drug
mules
at
the
bottom
of
the
range,
and
another
district
judge
will
say,
i
always
put
them
at
the
top
of
the
range,
and
that
was
deemed
to
be
an
acceptable
amount
of
disparity,
if
you
will,
between
sentences
that
did
not
offend
the
overriding
goal
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
to
eliminate
wholesale
disparity.
but
the
kind
of
disparity
that
i'm
talking
about
would
be
the
disparity
that
would
result
from
different
district
judges
having
different
beliefs
about
what
the
governing
law
requires,
and
there
is
no
reason
in
the
federal
guideline
system
to
tolerate
disagreements
between
district
judges
on
what
the
law
permits
them
to
do
or
what
the
law
requires
them
to
do.
those
are
issues
that,
by
providing
for
a
structure
of
appellate
review,
congress
anticipated
would
be
resolved
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
the
sentencing
commission
would
be
able
to
look
at
the
work
product
of
the
courts
of
appeals
as
well
as
the
district
courts--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
in
our
view,
it
may
not
matter
very
much
what
label
you
attach
to
it.
i
think
that
that
has
become
clear
through
some
of
the
questions
from
the
court.
we
think
that
the
proper
approach
is
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
review
departure
factors
that
have
been
recognized
to
be
permissible
under
something
close
to
a
de
novo
standard.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
when
the
district
court
is,
in
fact,
applying
guidelines
to
the
facts
and
it's
doing
so
under
a
correct
legal
standard--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
in
fact,
there's
quite
a
bit
of
indication
that
that's
exactly
what
congress
intended.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
at
pages
26
and
27
of
our
brief
we
set
out
the
legislative
history
that
accompanied--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
but
i'm
saying
that
in
order
to
apply
a
guideline
to
the
facts
one
must
first
know
legally
what
that
guideline
means,
and
that
raises
a
question
of
law
which
should
be
resolved
de
novo.
to
take
an
example
in
this
case,
the
defendants
contended
that
they
can
defend,
on
appeal,
the
district
court's
determination
to
depart
under
the
victim
misconduct
guideline,
5k2.10,
because
rodney
king's
misconduct
substantially
contributed
to
provoking
their
offense
conduct.
that's
their
contention.
our
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeal's
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion
is
that
the
district
court
didn't
really
find
that.
what
the
district
court
found
is
that
but
for
rodney
king's
misconduct
in
sending
the
police
on
a
chase
through
the
streets
of
los
angeles
and
eventually
stopping
and
acting
in
a
way
that
led
them
to
believe
he
was
not
submitting
to
arrest
and
engaging
in
an
attempt
to
escape,
but
for
those
events,
the
defendants
never
would
have
been
put
in
the
position
where
they
engaged
in
the
constitutional
violation
of
wilfully
using
excessive
force,
which
they
ultimately
did.
our
point
of
view
on
that
is
that
but
for
causation
is
not
the
kind
of
provocation
that
that
guideline
contemplates.
we
could
be
right
about
that,
we
could
be
wrong
about
it,
but
we
believe
it's
a
question
of
law.
if
ultimately,
however,
a
court
were
to
correctly
construe
the
guideline
and
to
understand
that
it
did
not
mean
that
but
for
causation
was
alone
enough,
and
it
then
went
through
and
applied
the
factors
to
the
specific
facts
of
the
case,
that
is
the
kind
of
determination
that
should
get
some
sort
of
deference
on
appeal.
so
we
are
not
seeking
wholly
to
remove
sentencing
discretion
from
district
courts
either
in
the
decision
whether
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
when
there's
a
permissible
factor
or
in
the
way
that
they
sentence
within
the
guidelines.
but
we
do
think
that
the
guidelines
contemplate
a
regime
under
which
two
things
will
happen.
one
is,
the
law
will
be
clarified
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
the
sentencing
commission
can
react
to
it
if
it
so
chooses,
and
can
amend
the
guidelines
to
clarify
what
the
proper
principles
are.
and
that
is
a
process
that
congress
clearly
and
specifically
contemplated.
and
second,
to
provide
a
common
law
development
of
how
the
recognized
departure
factors
should
be
applied
in
a
particular
case,
so
that
a
district
court
sitting
in
new
york
doesn't
think
that
it's
unusual
family
circumstances
if
you
have
one
small
child
under
the
age
of
3
and
you've
been
sentenced
to
a
10-year
drug
offense
and
it
was
your
first
time
offense,
while
a
different
district
judge
says
no,
as
a
matter
of
law
that
can't
possibly
be
unusual.
in
our
view
what
the
courts
of
appeals
should
do
is
review
the
decided
cases
that
come
to
them,
which
is
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
departures
to
begin
with,
and
then
attempt
to
harmonize
the
cases
and
make
the
facts
of
the
decided
cases
reconcilable
with
each
other.
it
may
be
that
in
carrying
out
that
task
the
courts
of
appeals
will
apply
limited
deference
at
first
until
they
gain
enough
experience.
it
may
also
be
that
after
they
chart
the
particular
area
by
deciding
enough
cases,
there
will
be
little
law
left
to
develop,
and
in
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
will
not
be
perfect
consistency,
justice
scalia,
and
i
doubt
seriously
that
anyone
could
come
up
with
a
system
that
would
produce
perfect
consistency.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
sentences
within
the
guidelines
are
favored
under
this
regime.
the
very
purpose
of
the
sentencing
guideline
system
was
to
provide
a
regime
under
which
the
majority
of
the
cases
would
fall
within
the
ranges
established
by
the
sentencing
commission.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
they
do
not,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
can
give
you
examples
of
why
i
think
they
should
not
do
that.
many
of
the
determinations
of
what
constitutes
the
heartland
are
really
determinations
about
what
are
the
legal
requirements
that
are
applicable
to
sentencing
that
applicable
defendant,
or
the
class
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
agree
with
you
that
there
are
two
classes
of
cases,
justice
souter,
although
for
the
reasons
i've
stated
i
think
that
the
theory
of
the
sentencing
guideline
system
requires
that
appellate
courts
make
an
effort
to
harmonize
the
departure--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--of
course
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
see
the
problem,
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
more
difficult
problem
were
we
not
living
with
about
8
years
of
experience
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
a
fairly
vast
body
of
appellate
case
law
that
has
defined
the
permissible
parameters
of
such
departures
as
family
circumstances.
of
course,
this
case
is
not
at
all
about
a
departure
like
family
circumstances.
this
case
is
far
closer
to
the
kind
of
example
that
the
court
considered
in
rivera
itself.
are
typical
needs
to
make
restitution,
part
of
the
heartland
of
embezzlement
cases,
such
that
the
fact
that
the
defendant
will
be
put
in
prison
and
have
more
difficulty
making
restitution
constitutes
a
ground
for
departure?
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
correctly,
in
our
view,
said
obviously
not,
because
in
the
typical
embezzlement
case
it's
fairly
clear
that
you're
going
to
have
the
need
for
some
restitution,
and
it's
obvious
that
it
would
be
far
more
difficult
to
make
restitution
if
you're
in
prison,
so
the
question
of
whether
typical
restitution
needs
are
within
the
heartland
was
resolved
as
one
of
law.
other
courts
have
taken
a
look
at...
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
