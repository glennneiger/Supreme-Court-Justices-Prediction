chief

william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-1664,
stacey
koon
v.
united
states,
94-8842,
laurence
powell
v.
united
states.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
record...
if
there's
no
difference
between
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
and
the
de
novo
standard,
we
might
as
well
dismiss
this
petition
as
improperly
granted,
because
that's
the
only
question
raised
in
the
petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
olson.
mr.
kopeny.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
what...
the
de
novo
standard
is
the
phrase
that's
used
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
you
don't
have
to
simply
devote
your
entire
argument
to
de
novo
versus
abuse
of
discretion,
but
those
are
the
words
that
the
court
adopted
from
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
apparently
identify
a
difference
in
approach
on
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kopeny.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
if
congress
hadn't
made
any
provision
for
the...
what
standard
to
use,
that
might
be
a
good
policy
argument,
but
it's
nothing
more
than
a
policy
argument.
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
rooted
in
any
statutory
provision,
at
least
judging
from
what
you've
said
so
far.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
it
doesn't
say
anything
like
that,
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
there
are
few
of
them
in
the
federal
system
the
courts
of
appeals
would
see
few
also,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
what
would
be
an
example,
in
the
government's
view,
of
the
application
of
the
last
portion
of
the
last
sentence
of
section
(e),
where
it
says
the
courts
of
appeals
shall
give
due
deference
to
the
district
court's
application
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts?
give
me
an
example
of
where
the
district
court
has
applied
the
guidelines
to
the
facts,
and
it's
the
kind
of
application
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
give
deference
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you...
okay,
you've
given
an
example.
now,
why
do
you
select
that
example
rather
than
some
others
that
have
been
talked
about
here
as
places
where
the
court
of
appeals
shall
give
due
deference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
use
of
permissible
factors
would
be
reviewed
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what
on
earth
does
that
language
we've
talked
about
before
mean?
where
the...
after
it
says
the
court
of
appeals
shall
give
due
regard
to
the
district
court's
judgment
credibility,
accept
findings
of
fact
that
aren't
clearly
erroneous,
and
shall
give
due
deference
to
the
district
court's
application
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
already
tremendously
circumscribes
that
statutory
language
in
a
way
that
there's
no
indication
that
it
should
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
almost
define
it
out
of
existence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you're
saying
that
the
legislative
history
overrides
the
language
that
congress
enacted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
olson,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
