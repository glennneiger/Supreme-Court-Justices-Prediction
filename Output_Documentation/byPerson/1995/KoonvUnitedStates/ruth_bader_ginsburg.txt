justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
a
question
within
that
5,
because
there's
one
thing
that
struck
me.
there
were
3
points,
one
for
specific
factors,
and
then
the
largest
factor
was
the
victim's
conduct.
is
there
any
guidance
about
the
number
of
points
that
a
district
judge
may
assign
to
particular
factors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
this
judge
had
assigned
6
to
that,
or
2
to
each
of
the
others,
it
would
just
be
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
district
judge
have...
since
he
has
to
justify
his
departure,
does
he
have
an
obligation
to
explain
why
it's
5
rather
than
1
or
2?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
on
that,
do
we
defer...
does
the
court
of
appeals
defer
to
a
district
judge's
determination
that
this
case
is
unusual?
ordinarily,
i
follow
the
guidelines,
but
this
is
not
a
heartlands
case.
this
case
is
unusual.
do
courts
of
appeals
owe
deference
to
taking
the
case
out
of
the
usual
box
and
into
the
special
box?
