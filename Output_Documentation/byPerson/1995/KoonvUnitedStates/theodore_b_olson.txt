mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
involves
the
kind
of
fact
intensive
decision
that
district
judges
make
40,000
times
each
year.
it
is
the
type
of
decision
that
trial
judges
are
ideally
suited
to
make,
that
appellate
judges
have
neither
the
institutional
competence
nor
resources
to
make,
and
that
congress
and
the
sentencing
reform
act
explicitly
vested
in
the
district
courts,
and
it
is
the
kind
of
reasoned
decisionmaking
that
congress
expected
would
provide
vital
data
to
the
sentencing
commission's
continuous
evolution
and
refinement
of
the
sentencing
guidelines.
the
sentencing
judge
in
this
case
made
his
decision
to
depart
from
the
sentencing
guideline
range
after
presiding
over
a
7-week
trial
and
a
lengthy
sentencing
process
involving
detailed
factual
submissions
by
all
of
the
parties.
he
explained
each
aspect
of
his
decision
and
his
reasoning
in
a
54-page
sentencing
memorandum.
each
reason
for
departing
from
the
guidelines
was
well
documented
and
based
upon
the
specific,
highly
unusual
facts
of
this
particular
case.
each
departure
was
predicated
on
factors
that
are
either
encouraged
as
departure
grounds
by
the
sentencing
commission
or
not
forbidden
or
discouraged
by
the
sentencing
commission.
it
is
important
to
state
at
the
outset
that
congress
explicitly
authorized
sentencing
judges
to
depart
from
the
prescribed
sentencing
ranges
if
they
find
factors
of
a
kind
or
to
a
degree
not
taken
into
consideration
by
the
commission
in
formulating
the
guidelines.
this,
according
to
the
commission,
requires
determining
whether
a
case
is
unusual,
atypical,
or
outside
the
heartland
of
the
guideline
range
prescribed
for
this
particular
offense.
this
is
a
highly
fact
bound
inquiry.
congress
stated
that
sentencing
judges
were
to
have
the
flexibility
and
were
required
to
impose
that...
use
that
flexibility
to
impose
individualized
sentences
when
warranted
by
aggravating
or
mitigating
factors
not
taken
into
account
by
the
guidelines.
sentencing
judges
are
to
be
guided
by
numerous
factors
in
deciding
whether
a
case
is
outside
the
heartland
of
the
case.
as
explained
for
the
court
in
the
rivera
case
from
the
first
circuit,
a
district
judge
is
going
to
use
the
facts
of
the
case,
as
found
by
him,
to
which
deference
must
be
given
unless
they're
clearly
erroneous,
his
experience
or
her
experience
as
a
sentencing
judge,
the
intuition
developed
over
years
of
sentencing,
other
statutes,
the
guidelines
themselves,
the
sentencing
regime
prescribed
by
the
guidelines,
and
to
bring
all
that
institutional
superior
feel,
as
the
rivera
court
put
it,
together
to
the
case
to
determine
whether
a
case
is
unusual
or
not.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
answer
to
that
question
is...
indeed,
the
answer,
i
can
state
directly
that
it
does
make
a
great
deal
of
difference,
because
it
is
an
experience
that
sentencing
judges
get.
what
the
sentencing
commission
intended
to
occur
is
that,
and
the
sentencing
commission
specifically
said
that
it
is
difficult
to
prescribe
a
single
set
of
guidelines
that
encompasses
the
vast
range
of
human
conduct
potentially
relevant
to
a
sentencing
commission,
so
what
the
sentencing...
to
a
sentencing
decision.
so
what
the
sentencing
commission
did
is
elaborate
on
what
the
experience
of
district
judges
had
been
and
create
a
typical
sentence
for
a
heartland
type
case,
but
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
answer
to
the
question,
if
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion,
it
is
unlawful,
but
it
is
important
that
that
abuse
of
discretion
standard
take
place.
the
congress
specifically
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
decision
itself
as
to
whether
or
not
a
case
falls
within
the
guidelines
involves
the
ascertainment
of
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
and
deciding
whether
the
facts
of
that
case
make
it
unusual
or
atypical
in
a
particular
situation.
district
judges
are
better--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
factor
is
allowable,
according
to
the
sentencing
commission,
to
which
the
authority
to
make
those
decisions
was
explicitly
delegated
by
congress.
according
to
the
sentencing
commission,
unless
we
articulate...
and
i'm
reading
from
part
1a(4)(b)
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
with
the
specific
exceptions
of
factors
taken
off
the
table
by
the
sentencing
commission,
the
commission
does
not
intend
to
limit
the
kind
of
factors,
whether
or
not
mentioned
in
the
guidelines,
that
could
constitute
grounds
for
departure.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the...
they're--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
submit
that
they're
tightly
interwoven
among
one
another.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
departure
could
exist
from
the
sentencing
guidelines
was
delegated
by
congress
to
the
sentencing
commission.
the
sentencing
commission
stated
that
certain
factors
were
off
limits,
the
rest
of
the
factors
were
on
limits
within
the
sentencing
discretion
limits,
and
that
these
factors
considered
in
this
case
were
within
that
discretion.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
exactly.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--as
this
court
indicated
in
the
williams
decision--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
except
to
the
extent
that
it
seems
to
me
that
that
decision
is
constrained
by
the
scheme
set
up
by
congress
which
delegated
certain
authorities
to
make...
authority
to
make
those
decisions
to
the
sentencing
commission,
and
the
sentencing
commission
in
this
case
has
made
those
decisions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
are
not
agreeing
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
suggesting
that
the
decision
that
was
made
here,
which
is
the
application
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
is
an
explicit
appellate
review
standard
articulated
in
the
statute
itself,
the
application
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
which
is
what
the
district
judge
did
here,
is
subject
to
a
due
deference
standard
specifically
adopted
by
congress.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well...
well,
i
think
that
the
case
is
that
simple,
because
the...
as
justice
breyer
explained
in
his
article
in
the
hofstra
law
review
in
1988,
the
sentencing
commission
explicitly
stated
that
most
factors
that
might
be
eligible
as
departure
factors
have
already
been
decided
by
the
commission
as
eligible
for
consideration.
the
commission
has
said,
we
are
not
deciding
unusual
cases.
we
need
the
decisionmaking
by
district
judges
to
tell
us
when
a
case
is
unusual
or
not,
and
the
reason
why
that
decision,
the
authority
for
which
is
vested
directly
in
the
district
courts,
should
be
made
by
district
courts,
is
because
district
courts,
day
in
and
day
out,
are
where
the
rubber
meets
the
road.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
believe
that
that's
a
fair
understanding
of
the
guidelines
themselves
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and...
because
we're
basing
that
argument
on
the
guidelines
and
this
court's
decision
in
williams,
i
must
hasten
to
say
that
it's
conceivable,
i
suppose,
although
i
have
not
thought
of
one,
where
a
pure
question
of
law
with
respect
to
a
departure
factor
could
come
up.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
clearly
that
is
the
case,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
only
argument
that
i
would
offer
with
respect
to
that
second
category
is
that
that...
if
it's
purely
an
interpretation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--of
the
guideline
it
is
almost
never
going
to
be
purely
an
interpretation
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
in
fact,
the...
as
the
court
put
it
in
the
rivera
case
in
the
first
circuit,
that
requires
an
examination
of
the
purposes
of
sentencing.
the
court
might
well
consider
that
the
specter
of
unfairness
under
those
circumstances
would
make
this
case
unusual.
that
would
be
an
entirely
permissible--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
agree
with
that,
but
that
makes
it
unnecessary
for
the
district
court
in
making
that
unusualness
decision
to
consider
both
the
facts
and
the
policies.
that
makes
it
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
and
that's
one
to
which
due
deference
should
be
given
to
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
one,
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
that
is
interrelated.
it
can
only
be
made
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
did
the
commission
consider
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
just
like
this
case
is
a
paradigm
example
of
that,
the
peculiar
facts
inform
the
decision
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
sentencing
commission
considered
that
factor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
all
fact...
the
commission
says
unless
we
prohibit
those
factors,
those
factors
are
something
that
we
want
district
judges
to
be
able
to
consider--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
then
we...
and
they
should
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
let
me
address
that
point,
because
in
the
ad
damnum
portion
of
the
rivera
case
the
court
indeed
sent
that
back
to
the
district
court
and
said,
if
you
find
the
need
for
restitution
in
that
case
particularly
unusual,
please
explain
your
reasons.
then
the
court
of
appeals
would
examine
that
and
give
that
whatever
deference
was
appropriate
because
of
the
superior
feel
of
the
district
court
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
that
case
that
made
it
unusual.
the
government
is
presenting
here
a
sharply
discrete
and
different
view
of
how
the
sentencing
guidelines,
the
sentencing
commission,
the
district
courts
and
the
appellate
courts
ought
to
work.
the
sentencing
commission
believes
that
unless
it
has...
because
it
is
the
delegee
of
legislative
authority
from
congress,
unless
it
has
taken
factors
off
the
table,
it
intends
the
district
courts
to
look
at
those
factors,
explain
them,
and
then
when
they're
abused,
when
there's
an
abuse
of
discretion,
that
can
be
corrected
in
a
specific
case
by
an
appellate
court
or
it
can
be
corrected
in
gross
by
the
sentencing
commission,
which
examines
and
processes
all
of
those
departure
decisions
and
decides
whether
it's
necessary
to
amend
the
guidelines,
and
it
does
that
on
a
yearly
basis
by
sending
changes
and
amendments
to
the
guidelines
to
congress
and...
if
it's
necessary
to
do
that.
because
the
sentencing
commission--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--thank
you.
