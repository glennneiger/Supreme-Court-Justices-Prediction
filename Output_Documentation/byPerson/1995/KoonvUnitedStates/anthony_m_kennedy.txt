justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
a
predicate
matter,
when
the
district
court
addresses
this
issue,
let's
take
the
hypothetical
issue
of
the
twin...
double
prosecutions.
the
district
court
must
ask,
must
it
not,
whether
or
not
the
commission
considered
this
in
formulating
the
guidelines.
that's
the
first
thing
it
asks.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now,
that
surely
must
be
a
question
of
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
all
law,
mr.
olson,
is
applied
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
but
can't
we
have
an
orderly
process
in
which
we
first
ask,
was
this
factor
taken
into
account
in
considering
the
guidelines?
as
to
that,
and
that
only,
is
that
not
a
question
of
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
if
you're
right,
then
you'll
prevail
as
a
matter
of
law.
