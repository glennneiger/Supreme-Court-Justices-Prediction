justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
obvious
that
there...
i
mean,
that
isn't...
you
could...
isn't
the
answer,
it
depends?
if...
there
are
certain
factors
like
race,
which
a
statute
says
are
totally
forbidden
from
departure.
it's
a
pure
question
of
law
whether
a
particular
case,
this
falls
within
that,
and
the
district
court
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
then
there
could
be
other
situations
where
the
reason
that
this
is
not
unusual
has
to
do
with
interpreting
another
guidelines,
e.g.,
does
this
kind
of
conduct
fall
within
the
heartland
of
the
physical
abuse
guideline
or
assault
guideline
or
something
else?
that's
a
pure
question
of
law.
then
there's
a
third
kind
of
question.
the
third
kind
of
question
is,
are
these
circumstances
unusual?
in
respect
to
that
one,
though,
it's
technically
a
question
of
law.
i
take
it
that
kind
of
decision
is
the
one
that
you
think
goes
primarily
to
the
district
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
it
might
be
in
this
very
case.
for
example,
one
of
the
reasons
that
there
was
departed
here,
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
departure
is
whether
or
not
two
prosecutions,
one
under
a
civil
rights
act
and
one
under
a
state
law,
is
a
justification
for
departure.
i
would
have
thought
that
raises
a
pure
question
of
law.
i
don't
see
what
light
the
district
court's
going
to
throw
on
that,
in
that
you'd
think
that
the
policies
underlying
the
civil
rights
statutes
would
be
relevant
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
district
court
knows
about
is
what's
unusual.
what
the
district
court
doesn't
have
a
comparative
advantage
about
is
the
comparative
policies
that
underlie
double
jeopardy,
different
statutes,
different
guidelines,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
don't
know,
do
we...
we
don't
know,
of
the
four
different
reasons
that
the
district
court
gave
for
departing,
how
much
weigh
the
gave
to
each
of
the
reasons?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
don't
we
then...
suppose
we
thought
that
in
respect
to
some
of
the
reasons
it
is
a
matter
where
he
has
expertise
and
can
decide
how
unusual,
but
as
to
others,
it's
purely
a
question
of
law.
that
is,
the
court
of
appeals
could
decide
these
in
respect
to
others,
like
the
double
jeopardy
type
thing.
is...
what
do
we
do
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you've
left
out
one
provision,
which
is
where
your...
where
the
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
be
reviewing
a
district
court's
decision
to
depart.
it
says,
on
appeal,
if
the
court--
--where
are
you
reading
from?
i'm
reading
from...
well,
i'm
embarrassed
to
say
i'm
reading
from
rivera--
[laughter]
but
it
is...
i'm
reading
the
quotation
of
the
statute,
which
is
18
u.s.c.
3742(f).
(f)?
yes,
and...
yes,
it
says
on
appeal,
if
the
court
of
appeals
determines
the
sentence
is
unreasonable...
and
at
least
i'd
thought
that
that
makes
a
difference.
that
is,
it
suggests
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
do
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
departure
of
the
district
court
is
unreasonable,
which
is
different
from
simply
reviewing
it
de
novo
all
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
thought
that
that
added
some
support
to
the
notion
that
at
least
sometimes
the
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
pay
attention
to
what
the
district
court
says
where
that's
appropriate,
where
the
district
court
knows
more
about
it,
particularly
in
respect
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
set
of
circumstances
is
unusual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
really
think...
i
mean,
you
have
500,
700
district
court
judges.
they
have
thousands
of
different
kinds
of
circumstances.
the
basic
theory
written
into
the
statute
is,
judge,
if
you
have
a
normal
case,
apply
the
guidelines,
judge,
if
you
have
an
unusual
case,
depart,
and
you
think
that
the
courts
of
appeals
that
don't
see
those
cases
are,
no
matter
what,
supposed
to
decide
to
every
factual
circumstance,
whether
or
not
this
particular
odd
factual
circumstance...
you
know,
the
person
had
a
low
iq,
or,
i
don't
know,
some
very
weird
thing...
in
each
instance,
they're
the
ones
that
are
supposed
to
decide,
ab
initio,
whether
it's
unusual
or
not
unusual,
pay
no
particular
attention
to
the
expertise
of
the
district
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then
the
question
is,
what
kind
of
attention
do
they
pay,
and
once
you
say
that,
you
get
into
the
job
of
saying...
you
get
into
the
idea
that
the
kind
of
attention
you
should
pay
is
the
kind
of
attention
that
comes
out
of
their
experience.
their
experience
is
to
know
when
circumstances
are
unusual,
so
when
they
think
they're
unusual,
we
pay
some
attention
to
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
don't
just
substitute
our
own
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
over
time
you
get
to
understand
that,
and
over
time
a
common
law
develops,
and
over
time
it
becomes
more
sensible,
and
that's
either
done
in
the
rubric
of
use
of
discretion,
where
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
depends
on
the
expertise
of
the
district
court,
or
it's
done
without
any
deference,
or
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
depends
on
purely
legal
interpretations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
once
you're
there,
then
they
say
at
least
look
at
the
question
of
how
much
violence
was
involved
in
this
instance
and
how
much
provocation,
and
they're
saying
that
that's
a
paradigm
instance
of
where,
in
fact,
the
district
court
has
some
experience
as
to
whether
or
not
in
this
kind
of
case
there
is
a
lot,
a
little,
not
too
much
violence
by
way
of
provocation,
and
so
there
should
have
been
deference
in
respect
to
that
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
idea...
the
idea
of
the
guidelines,
i
think,
is
to
get
sentences
that
are
fair,
and
if
the
judge,
in
fact,
gives
his
reasons,
isn't...
don't
you
then
turn...
i
mean,
i'm
more
interested
in
the
general
principle
than
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
that's
what
we
have
to
get
right.
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases,
50,000
a
year,
so
if
you
look...
isn't
the
guiding
principle
in
3742(e),
which
says...
i
was
wrong
about
(f),
(f)
is
the
same
as
(e),
but
it's
really
(e).
it
tells
us
what
to
do.
it
says,
we
review
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals
should
say,
is
it
outside
the
guideline
range?
this
is
outside
the
guideline
range,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
have
one
of
those
before
us,
and
then
say,
is
it
unreasonable?
that's
the
word
they
use,
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
decides
whether
it
is
unreasonable,
it
should
have
regard
for
the
reasons
that
the
district
court
gives
as
well
as
the
purposes
of
punishment.
so
my
belief
is,
and
i
want
you
to
respond
if
i'm
not
right,
that
that
is
a
rather
general
framework
within
which
courts
of
appeals
can
work
out
principles
over
time
on
the
basis
of
what
is
unreasonable,
and
that
they
ought
to
give
particular
consideration
to
the
expertise
of
the
district
courts
in
telling
us
at
least
initially
what
is
unusual
and
what
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
except
at
the
beginning
the
guidelines
say,
the
commission
has
considered
no
factor
fully,
but
for
the
statutory
factors
that
they're
prohibited
from
taking
into
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
i
thought
the
theory
also
was
that
you'd
build
on
the
experience
of
district
judges
collecting
information
about
what
they
consider
significant
enough
to
depart,
the
commission
itself
analyzing
that
information,
and
revising
the
guidelines
in
light
thereof.
i
mean,
how
is
a
court
of
appeals
supposed
to
know,
as
a
straight
question
of
law,
whether
the
woman
whose
first
offense
it
is
with
the
cocaine
has
five
children,
was
trying
to
earn
money
for
christmas,
had
no
one
to
leave
the
children
with
when
she
goes
to
prison...
you
know,
the
facts
of
rivera.
is
a
court
of
appeals
supposed
to
look
that
up
in
a
statute
book
about
whether
that
story,
which
happens
to
be
true,
let's
say,
in
this
instance...
i
know
some
of
them
wouldn't
be
true,
but
suppose
it
was
in
this
instance.
is
there
a
statute
book
or
a
law
book
where
you
look
up
whether
that's
unusual
or
not
unusual?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it
a
judge
is
supposed
to...
you
see
the
problem?
