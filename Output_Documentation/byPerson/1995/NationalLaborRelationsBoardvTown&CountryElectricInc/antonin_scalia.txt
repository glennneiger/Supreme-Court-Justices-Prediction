justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
say
this...
this
would
be
answered
no,
that
last
question.
you
say
that
that
question,
put
to
a
union
organizer,
would
be
answered
no,
whether
there's
any
conflicting
obligation
to
someone
else
that
would
interfere
with
duties
in
any
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
union
organizer
can
stand
up
and
say
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
i'm
just
talking
about
the
question
that
you
put.
you
said
that
the
employer
may
ask
applicants
whether
he
has
any
commitment
to
a
third
party
that
would
interfere
with
duties
in
any
way,
and
as
i
understand
your
presentation
to
us,
you
think
that
the
union
organizer
can
answer
that
question
honestly,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
if
it
were
a
term
contract.
i
mean...
but
that...
would
people
who
are...
sure.
you...
suppose
it's
a
term
contract
for
3
years,
and
he
has
the
same
arrangement
with
the
union
that
he'll
quit
when
the
union
tells
him
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
suppose
he
doesn't
ask?
would
that,
the
existence
of
that
conflict
not
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
dismissal?
that's
not
this
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
--on
behalf
of
these
people.
do
you
acknowledge
that
would
be
different,
though,
because
there
his
obligation
to
the
union
might
indeed
require
him
to
break
a
duty,
a
commitment
to
the
employer.
mr.
wallace,
it
would
be
different
in
terms
of
whether
the
employer
has
a
right
to
discharge
him,
but
would
it
be
different
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
he
was
nevertheless
an
employee
during
the
period
of
the
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
inconsistent
with
the
duty
of
the
employer?
i
mean,
i
thought
that
the
whole
theory
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
that
you
can
be
a
good
employee
and
a
loyal
union
member
at
the
same
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
if
you
have
a
duty
to
two
employers
with
respect
to
the
same
act,
you
have
a
problem,
but
his
duty
to
the
employer
related
to
one
act,
his
duty
to
the
union
related
to
other
acts,
namely,
his
off-duty
time
in
which
he
would
be
hire...
be
recruiting
people
to
the
union.
what's
bad
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
doesn't
it
have
to
be,
under
the
labor
relations
act?
i
mean,
you
can
fire
them
for
that,
can't
you?
can
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
--use
his--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
i
understand
that.
okay.
well,
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
so?
all
those
shop
stewards
who
have
obligations
to
the
union,
do
they
remain
employees,
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they're
doing
work
for
the
union,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
the
theory
of
the
act
is
that
there's
no
inherent
incompatibility
between
obligations
to
the
union
and
obligation
to
the
employer,
and
i
don't
know
how
to
make
the
act
work
without
adopting
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
it
inconsistent?
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
it's
not
inconsistent
as
to
the
work
he's
doing
for
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
union's
telling
him
to
sabotage,
you
know,
the
machinery
he's
working
on,
yes,
that's
inconsistent,
but
the
union's
not
directing
his
work
as
to
what
he's
doing
for
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
could
say
that
about
anybody
who
has
a
second
job,
whether
it's
with
the
union
or
not.
indeed,
you
could
say
it
about
people
who
are
independently
wealthy
and
are
working
at
gm
just
for
the
fun
of
it.
that
doesn't
make
them
nonemployees,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
contract
is
a
peppercorn
or
nothing
at
all...
a
zealot
with
a
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you'd
change
your
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
are
you
going
to
stand
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
[laughter]
you
better
be
careful.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
find
in
the
law
of
agency
that
contradicts...
i
mean,
the
restatement?
i
have
the
restatement
here
somewhere.
i
don't
find
it
inconsistent.
it
says,
a
person
may
be
the
servant
of
two
masters
not
joint
employers
at
one
time
as
to
one
act,
if
the
service
to
one
does
not
involve
abandonment
of
the
service
to
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
here
the
one
does
involve...
but
you
leave
out
the
fact
that
it
says,
as
to
one
act.
you
can
easily
be
the
servant
of
two
masters
as
to
different
acts.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
it's
not
a
control
over
the
act
that
he's
doing
from
the
employer,
for
the
employer...
what
control
does
the
union
exercise
over
the
act
that
he
is
doing
for
the
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
no
obligation
to
the
employer
to
stay.
i
mean,
if
it
were
a
term
contract,
yes.
then
he'd
have
a
duty
to
the
employer.
but
all...
by
definition,
the
person
who's
in
an
at-will
contract
has
no
duty
to
the
employer
to
stay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
it's
not
an
order
from
the
union
that
causes
him
to
violate
a
duty
to
the
employer,
i
don't
see
how
that
changes
his
employee
status.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
the
government's
position
that
you
not
only...
well,
you
cannot
refuse
to
hire
these
salts.
isn't
that
the
government's
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
going
in
you
shouldn't...
you
can't
turn
down
the
other
seven
just
because
you
know
that
they're
union
salts.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
before
you
even
start,
i
have...
the
one
thing
that
sticks
in
my
craw
a
little
bit
about
this
case
is
not
the
necessity
of
treating
this
person
as
an
employee,
that's
fine,
but
the
inability
not
only
not
to
fire
the
person
knowing
that
he's
on
the
union
payroll,
but
even
the
inability
to
refuse
to
hire
the
person
knowing
that
he's
on
the
union
payroll.
why
must
they
be
the
same
question?
is
there
any
way
that
i
can
agree
with
you
on
the
employee
question
but
not
necessarily
believe
that
the
salt
has
to
be
hired
if
the
employer
knows
going
in
that
this
person
who
wants
to
be
his
employee
is
on
the
union
payroll?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
make
it
unlawful
to
refuse
to
hire
him,
or
to
fire
him,
for
that
matter?
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
157.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
include
the
right
to
be
employed
by
a
labor
union?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
no
problem
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
no
problem
with
all
that.
the
employer
says,
you
know,
i
have
no
problem
with
all
that.
i
just
don't
want
you
to
be
on
the
union
payroll.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
i
just
don't
want
you
to
be
on
the
union
payroll.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
conduct
organizational
activity,
you
know,
god
bless
you,
but
i
do
not
want
a
worker
who
is
on
the
union
payroll.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
reasonable
position
for
an
employer
to
take.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
separate
question,
though,
from
whether
he's
an
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
he's
hired.
