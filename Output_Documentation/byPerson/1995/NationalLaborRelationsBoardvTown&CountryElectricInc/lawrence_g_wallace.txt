mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
almost
30
years,
the
national
labor
relations
board
consistently
and
repeatedly
has
held
that
a
person
who
applies
for
or
holds
a
job
with
an
employer
that
he
intends
to
try
to
organize,
and
who
will
be
compensated
by
a
union
for
his
organizational
activity,
is
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
section
2(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
section
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
and
was
last
interpreted
and
applied
by
this
court
in
its
1984
decision
in
sure-tan
incorporated
against
the
nlrb,
and
we
are
content
to
use
the
words
of
this
court
in
sure-tan
in
describing
this
provision,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
page
891
of
volume
467
u.s.,
the
breadth
of
section
2(3)'s
definition
is
striking.
the
act
squarely
implies
to
"any
employee".
the
only
limitations
are
specific
exemptions
for
agricultural
laborers,
domestic
workers,
individuals
employed
by
their
spouses
or
parents,
individuals
employed
as
independent
contractors
or
supervisors,
and
individuals
employed
by
a
person
who
is
not
an
employer
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
court
then
concluded
that
undocumented
aliens
are
not
among
the
few
groups
of
workers
expressly
exempted
by
congress,
and
they
therefore
plainly
come
within
the
broad
statutory
definition.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
conclusion
that
the
court
reached,
and
it
is
our--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--our
position
is
that
he
is
therefore
an
employee
unless
there
are
reasons,
in
interpreting
the
national
labor
relations
act,
why
an
implied
exemption
should
be
found,
a
question
for
the
board
to
address
initially,
and
the
only
example
in
which
this
court
found
an
implied
exemption
was
the
case
of
nlrb
v.
bell
aerospace
which
involved
managerial
employees,
and
the
court
in
reliance
upon
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
its
overruling
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
packard
case
by
adding
to
this
list
of
exemptions
supervisors
has...
that
congress
had
relied
on
the
notion
that
managerial
employees
would
be
excluded
sort
of
a
fortiori
from
supervisors,
and
that
the
board
had
always,
while
not
holding
them
not
to
be
employees,
had
always
placed
them
in
separate
bargaining
units
from
other
employees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
he
applied
for
a
job
that
he
was
seeking
where
he
would
be
working
for
wages
under
the
supervision
of
the
employers--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--he
would
be
within
the
statutory
definition
of
employee.
what
the
board
has--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
doesn't
mean
that
he
has
to
be
hired.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
then
he's
subject
to
all
of
the
company's
work
rules
and
duties
of
loyalty.
of
course
if
the
company
hires
him,
he's
even
more
so
an
employee.
the
court
resolved
in
the
1941
decision
in
phelps
dodge
that
applicants
are
within
the
statutory
coverage
because
section
8(a)(3)--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--protects
applicants
from
discrimination
in
hiring.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is...
of
course
it
would
be
a
breach
of
duty,
whether
it
would
be
because
he
wanted
to
do
it
of
his
own
volition
or
whether
because
of
loyalty
to
some
other
group.
it
would
be
a
breach
of
duty.
what
the
board...
the
board
has
pointed
the
way
to
the
proper
analysis
of
these
issues
in
the
companion
case
of
this
very
case.
there
were
two
cases
decided
together,
this
case
and
sunland
construction
company,
which
is
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs,
and
there
the
board
held,
after
writing
an
opinion
identical
to
the
opinion
in
this
one
until
the
last
few
paragraphs...
reaching
the
conclusion
that
applications
of
this
kind
are
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
the
board
held
that
nonetheless
it
would
not
be
a
violation,
an
unjustified
discrimination
under
8(a)(1)
or
8(a)(3)
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
hire
a
paid
union
organizer
in
the
discrete
context
of
an
ongoing
strike
situation
in
which
the
paid
union
organizer
would
have
a
duty
to
support
the
work
stoppage
in
an
attempt
to
coerce
the
employer,
a
legitimate
attempt
under
the
law
to
coerce
the
employer
to
accede
to
the
union's
demands.
and
the
employer
would
have
an
equally
legitimate
right
to
want
to
hire
replacement
workers
who
might
be
nonunion
members,
might
be
outside
the
bargaining
unit,
might
be
outside
strike-breakers--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
other
kinds
to
try--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
carry
on
their
operations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
while
that
is
a
rule
of
the
voluntary
organization,
section
7
of
the
act
protects
the
right
of
workers
to
have
voluntary
organizations,
including
their
right
to
make
reasonable
rules
of
conduct
for
their
members,
but
you're
talking
about
a
future
contingency,
and
when
the
time
comes,
under
this
court's
decision
in
pattern
makers
and
the
rationale
of
this
decision,
each
individual
can
decide
for
himself
whether
he
will
in
fact
adhere
to
the
union
rule--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--he
would
definitely
qualify
as
an
employee,
although
the
rationale
of
sunland
might
apply.
this
is
not
an
uncommon
hypothetical.
there
can
be
employees
who
have
been
suspended
from
their
job
who
have
an
agreement
with
the
employer
that
they
will
return
when
recalled
and
retain
their
seniority
and
retain
their
advanced
pay
scale
status,
so
they
have
an
economic
incentive
to
return
to
this
competing
employer.
in
the
meantime,
they've
been
laid
off,
they
need
a
job,
they
go
to
another
competitor,
and
take
the
job.
they're...
of
course
they're
an
employee.
they're
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
employer
must
withhold
taxes
for
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
possible,
but
they
are
an
employee--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--he's
an
employee,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
he's
entitled
to
vote.
that
is
a
question
about
which
employees
have
a
community
of
interest
with
a
purpose--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
recall.
it's
not
directly
before
us,
but
it's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
board
has
always
held--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--these
people
are
employees.
they
just...
they
don't
have
a
community
of
interest
with
other
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
that
has
always
been
the
inquiry
about
whether
someone
can
vote
in
a
particular
election,
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
because
of
the
community
of
interest
standards--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
the
board
looks
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
board's
approach
and
the
approach
that
judge
williams
took
on
behalf
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
willmar
case
are
substantially
identical.
there
may
be
some
differences
in
articulation,
but
in
willmar,
the
d.c.
circuit
said
that
yes,
these
are
employees,
and
we
leave
for
another
day
whether
the
employer
would
be
justified
in
treating
them
differently
under
8(a)(1)
or
8(a)(3),
in
other
words
in
not
hiring
them.
it
was
shortly
thereafter
that
the
board
decided
town
&
country
and
sunland,
and
it
reached
opposite
conclusions
on
the
question
left
for
another
day,
depending
on
whether
there
was
an
ongoing
strike
or
not,
because
the
board
did
not
regard
it
as
an
irreconcilable
conflict
of
interest
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
an
employee
to
have
a
loyalty
to
his
union
and
to
the
voluntary
right
of
self-organization
and
to
the
employer.
that's
what
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
focus
before
the
board
was
on
the
compensation
question.
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
that
relied
more
strongly
and
responded,
and
their
amici
are
relying
more
strongly
on
the
salting
resolution
itself.
so
the
board
did
not
address
a
contention
specifically
based
on
the
salting
resolution,
but
it
did
discuss
the
question
of
control,
which
is
what
that
argument
is
based
on,
and
pointed
out
that
any
paid
union
organizer,
as
the
board
calls
anyone
getting
any
form
of
compensation
from
the
union
with
a
duty
to
organize,
would
still
be
subject
to
the
employer's
direction
and
control,
to
his
work
rules,
to
the
obligations
to
perform
his
duties
in
an
acceptable
manner
for
the
employer
and,
indeed,
what
the
board
found
is
that
someone
in
this
situation
has
an
added
incentive
not
to
perform
in
a
substandard
manner
or
to
do
any
act
that
would
warrant
discharge,
because
that
would
defeat
his
opportunity
to
be
on
the
premises
and
to
engage
in
his
organizing
campaign
during
off-work
hours.
so
far
from
finding
any
conflicting
duties...
because
after
all
he's
subject
to
the
same
rules
of
no
solicitation
during
work
time
or
in
work
areas.
it's
done
at
lunch
break
or
after
work
is
over.
you
don't
really
have
acts
simultaneously
being
performed--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
the
classic
sense
for
two
different
masters
under
the
restatement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
long
as
it's
a
neutral
policy
that
is
not
directed
at
antiunion
animus.
it
could
be
in
a
particular
factual
setting
a
pretext
for
the
denial
of
rights
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
absolutely.
any
neutral
across-the-board
policy
requiring
a
commitment
to
work
for
a
certain
duration
of
time,
asking
whether
there
are
obligations
to
any
third
party
that
might
interfere
with
future
duties
in
any
way,
certainly
asking
whether
there
was
an
obligation
to
anyone--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
depends
on
what
the
neutral
policy
of
the
employer
is.
if
the
employer
says
that
they
want
everyone
to
swear
that
they
have
no
obligation
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
true
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
you
have
employment
at
will,
where
either
the
employer
or
the
employee
has
a
right
to
leave
at
any
time.
that's
the
only
possible--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
employer
could
definitely
ask
whether
there
are
any
conflicting
obligations
that
would
result
in
premature
departure
and
failure
to
observe
the
term.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
not
this
case--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
i
can't
really
precommit
the
board
to
it.
this
is
not
an
employer
who
asked
for
any
term--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--precisely
what
i
was
about
to
say.
he
would
still
be
an
employee
as
an
applicant
for
the
job,
but
it
would
raise
the
sunland
question.
the
sunland
contention
that
this
was
justified
discrimination
was
never
raised
before
the
board
in
this
case,
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
raise
it
in
this
case
because
at
the
time
the
adverse
action
was
taken,
the
employer
here
did
not
know
of
the
salting
resolution,
did
not
know
of
the
union
compensation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
a
conflicting
obligation,
because
the
union--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
a
question
for
the
board,
and
it
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
in
sunland
construction,
which
is
the
only
case
in
which
it
has
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
in
the
discrete
context
of
an
ongoing
strike.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
yes,
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
would
not
anticipate
that
the
board
would
readily
expand
sunland
construction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course,
that
question
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review
if
the
board
attempted
to
do
it.
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
that
that
is
the
proper
analytical
approach
to
questions
of
whether
refusal
to
hire
a
particular
person
would
be
justified,
but
instead,
this
case
has
been
litigated
on
a
theory
that
these
people
are
sort
of
outlaws
ab
initio,
they're
not
even
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
even
though
the
employer
did
not
know
of
the
salting
resolution
or
the
compensation
at
the
time
it
took
the
adverse
action.
this
is
a
way
to
get
around
the
mckennon
v.
national
banner
analysis
for
after-acquired
knowledge.
you
just
say,
well,
they're
outlaws
ab
initio,
now
that
we
know
this
knowledge,
and
of
course
the
knowledge
itself
has
to
be
something
disqualifying
in
order
for
the
after-acquired
knowledge
to
affect
the
remedy
under
mckennon
v.
national
banner,
which
the
board
said
is
not
the
case
here
anyway.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
argue
that
deference
is
appropriate
here,
as
the
court
stated
quite
explicitly
in
sure-tan.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
situation
in
which
both
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
looked
toward
various
provisions
of
the
restatement
of
agency
to
say
what
common
law
principles
would
shed
light
here.
the
difference
between
them
was
not
so
much
about
what
the
common
law
principles
are.
it
was
a
difference
about
how
those
principles
should
be
applied
to
a
question
of
labor
management
relations
in
the
context
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
common
law
of
agency
really
does
not
answer
the
question
of
how
do
you
apply
these
principles
in
the
context
of
a
labor
management
question
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
its
section
7
rights
and
its
rights
under
section
8.
that
is
a
question
that
implicates
the
board's
expertise.
there
wasn't
a
dispute
about
what
are
those
principles.
they
were
both
getting
them
out
of
the
restatement
of
agency.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
did
point
out
one
implied
exception
that
the
court
found
in
the
bell
aerospace
case,
and
what
i
was
about
to
say
at
that
point
in
my
argument
was
that
the
court's
opinion
in
sure-tan,
after
saying
that
the
undocumented
aliens
fall
within
the
plain
meaning,
then
went
on
to
analyze
whether
the
board's
interpretation
that
they
should
therefore
be
covered
was
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
entitled
to
deference,
and
agreed,
after
some
discussion,
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
like
to
think
of
it
as
equivalent
to
chevron
deference.
it
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i'm
very
happy
with
what
the
court
said
in
sure-tan.
the
task
of
defining
the
term
employee...
and
i'm
looking
at
page
891
of
that
opinion...
is
one
that
"has
been
assigned
primarily
to
the
agency
created
by
congress
to
administer
the
act.
"
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
court's
opinion,
"the
board's
construction
of
that
term
is
entitled
to
considerable
deference
and
we
will
uphold
any
interpretation
that
is
reasonably
defensible.
"
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
before
chevron.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
only
in
it's
emphasis--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--on
the
step
1
analysis
that
a
statute
may
definitively
answer
the
question
on
its
face,
which
if
that
applies
here
would
apply
in
our
favor.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--8(a)(1)
and
8(a)(3)
protect
against
coercion
or
intimidation
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--right.
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
includes
the
right
to
participate
in
the
union
and
to
comply
with
its
voluntary
rules,
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--long
as
the
member
wants
to
do
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
organizational
activity
is
an
important
part
of
a
union's
functions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
may
be
a
reasonable
position,
but
it
is
a
position
that
interferes
with
the
union's
ability
to
conduct
its
protected
activities.
in
any
event,
that
question
wasn't
even
put
to
the
board
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
a
separate
question,
as
the
sunland
decision
illustrates,
but
the
board
made
its
views
on
that
question
quite
clear
in
this
case.
i
do
want
to
mention
that
there
is
one
paragraph
in
the
board's
opinion,
and
this
is
not
the
alj's
opinion,
it's
the
board's
own
opinion
on
page
37a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition,
that
responds
very
succinctly
to
the
contentions
made
by
the
respondent
and
its
amici
which
were
made
before
the
board
that
paid
union
organizers
will
engage
in
activities
to
the
detriment
of
work
assigned
by
the
employer
or
will
embark
on
acts
inimical
to
the
employer's
legitimate
interests,
and
the
board
said,
we
do
not
agree,
and
then
there
are
several
more
sentences
that
specifically
reflect
the
judgment
of
the
board
in
response
to
this,
and
the
complete
lack
of
evidentiary
support
for
the
speculations
in
this
case.
and
one
is
left
with
the
question
in
this
case
that
first
occurred
to
me
when
the
case
came
to
our
office,
if
a
journeyman
electrician
working
under
the
direction
and
control
and
according
to
the
work
rules
and
on
the
payroll
of
an
employer
covered
by
the
act
is
not
an
employee,
what
in
the
world
is
he?
he's
not
in
domestic
service
or
an
independent
contractor
or
supervisor.
