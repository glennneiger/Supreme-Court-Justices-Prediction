justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
any
case,
i
take
it
your
answer,
earlier
answer
that
it's
the
failure
to
limit
his
activities
to
off-duty
time,
i
take
it
you
withdraw
that
answer.
that
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
your
position--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because...
well,
if
i
understood...
i
thought
your
answered
justice
ginsburg
by
saying,
what
if
the
employee
comes...
is
already
hired,
the
union
says,
we'll
pay
you
money
to
organize
during
the
lunch
breaks
and
the
off
time.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
that,
in
fact,
would
remove
the
person
from
employee
status.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
there's
nothing
about
off-time
or
on-time
which
is
essential
to
your
position.
your
position
is,
no
matter
when
he
exercises
these
responsibilities
to
the
union,
the
fact
that
he
has
them
precludes
his
employee
status.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
so
it's
got
nothing
to
do,
then,
with
on-time
or
off-time.
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
not
going
to
do
that
very
effectively
if
he
is
plausibly
fired
for
bad
work.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
want
him
to
do
good
work
but
be
obnoxious,
isn't
that--
[laughter]
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
david
h.
souter
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
can't
you
be
an
unpaid
agent?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
would
be
different,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
a
zealot.
if
the
unpaid
zealot
doesn't--
--okay,
it
has
to
be
a
zealot
with
a
contract,
right?
[laughter]
