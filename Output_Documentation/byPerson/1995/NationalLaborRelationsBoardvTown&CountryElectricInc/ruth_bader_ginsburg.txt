mr.
wallace,
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
wallace--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
wouldn't
the
same
reasoning
that
you've
just
explained
to
us
for
the
strike
exception
apply
to
the
person
who
is
under
an
agreement
with
the
union
to
walk
out
when
the
union
blows
the
whistle?
why
isn't
there
that
same
inconsistency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
different,
mr.
wallace.
different...
the
worker
can
decide
for
himself.
the
worker
who
is
under
an
agreement
that
the
worker
will
walk
when
told
to
by
a
third
party...
let's
say
the
third
party
were
not
the
union,
but
a
competitor.
the
applicant
has
an
agreement
with
the
competitor
that
he
will,
if
he
gets
this
job
he'll
stay
on
it
till
the
competitor
says,
walk
out.
can
such
a
person
qualify
as
an
employee
when,
going
in,
he
has
that
agreement
with
a
competitor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
can
be
an
employee
for
one
purpose
and
not
the
other,
isn't
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
example,
let's
take
these
employees,
and
there's
an
election.
they
go
in,
and
they
try
to
organize.
there
are
a
number
of
workers
who
are
in
favor
of
the
union.
there's
an
election.
can
the
paid
organizer...
does
a
paid
organizer
count
as
an
employee
for
that
purpose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
provision
in
the
statute
that
entitles
someone
to
vote
in
a
union
election?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
uses
the
word
employee,
someone
might
not
be
an
employee
for
that
purpose,
although
would
be
an
employee
for
another
purpose.
well,
isn't
the
answer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
tell
me--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
you're
saying
about
someone
who
has
an
inconsistent
obligation,
whether
that
coincides
with
the
approach
that
judge
williams
took
in
the
willmar
case,
or
is
it
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
did
the
board
rule
expressly
on
the
provision
of
the
salting
resolution
that
the
employee
would
walk
when
told
to
by
the
union?
i
wasn't
aware
that
the
board
had
ruled
specifically
on
that,
as
distinguished
from
being
paid
by
the
union.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
i
thought
your
first
argument,
though,
was
that
this
statute
has
a
plain
meaning
that
everything
that
isn't
excluded
is
included.
if
that's
the
case,
then
you
don't
have
any
question
of
deference,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
chevron
deference,
or
some
other
kind
of
deference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
equivalent...
you
seem
to
be
not
wanting
to
put
the
chevron
label
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying,
then,
if
the
identical
arrangement
were
made
between
someone
who
was
already
hired
by
the
employer,
somebody
who's
on
the
job,
then
becomes
a
paid
organizer
for
the
union
in
addition,
that
that
person
at
that
point
would
lose
employee
status?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
same
thing...
same
thing,
except
it's
someone
who
is
already
on
the
payroll.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
every
other
respect
it's
the
same.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
not
talk
in
the
abstract.
the
worker
is
doing
the
job,
becomes
a
convert
to
the
union,
takes
money
from
the
union
to
organize
during
lunch
time
and
work
breaks,
and
that's
it,
compensated
for
attempting
to
organize
the
shop.
is
that
person
no
longer
an
employee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
the
salting
resolution
out
of
it,
and
just
have
the
compensation
for
organizing
the
shop,
using...
within
the
rules
of
shop
using
free
time
and
lunch
breaks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
is
it
necessarily--
--and
that's
true
even
if
they
work
full-time
and
perform
all
the
duties
the
employers
want
them
to
perform,
and
earn
their
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
have
been
cause
for
discharge--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that's
a
question
of
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
you
had
somebody
who
was
a
zealous
union
person,
didn't
take
a
penny
because
he
was
just
so
devoted
to
the
union,
doesn't
want
to
take
anything
from
the
union
treasury,
doing
the
same
thing
that
this
person
did,
undertakes
the
job,
said
union,
i'm
going
to
use
all
my
free
time
to
proselytize
for
you,
does
that
person
lose
employee
status?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
your
position
on
whether
any
deference
is
owed
to
the
nlrb
in
defining
a
term
used
in
the
nlra?
in
this
case,
the
term
is
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
that
employee
is
not
self-defining.
have
you
said
that?
the
word,
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
room
for...
any
room
for
interpretation,
or
does
the
word
employee
have
a
plain
meaning?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
position
is,
there's
room
for
interpretation,
but
this
particular
interpretation
is
unreasonable.
