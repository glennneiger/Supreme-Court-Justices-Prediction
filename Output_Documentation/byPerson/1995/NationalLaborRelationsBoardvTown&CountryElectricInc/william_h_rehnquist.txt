chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-947,
national
labor
relations
board
v.
town
&
country
electric.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position,
mr.
wallace,
that
if
a
person
does
not
come
within
any
of
those
exemptions
and
is
"hired"
he
is
therefore
an
employee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
what
your
position--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
about
an
employee
who
fills
out
a
job
application,
is
hired,
and
yet
his
only
purpose
is
to
get
into
the
plant
so
that
he
can
blow
it
up?
he's
a
terrorist.
is
that
person
an
employee
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
he...
that
person
is
an
employee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
he...
the
company,
not
knowing
this,
goes
ahead
and
hires
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--isn't
that
exhibit
a,
what
i'm
talking
about,
of
inconsistent
loyalties?
i
mean,
the
person
is
simply
going
on
the
payroll
in
order
to
get
into
the
factory.
he'll
perform
the
work
for
a
day,
but
then
he
intends
to
blow
the
place
up
that
night.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
sure-tan
come
down
before
or
after
chevron?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
chevron
has
changed
that
principle
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
pease,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
all
employees
of
general
motors
are
really
concerned
whether
the
employer
likes
them
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
an
ordinary
attribute
of
industrial
employment,
is
it,
is
concern
that
the
employer
like
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
again
do
you
think
the
board
is
partial
here,
as
opposed
to
being
neutral
between
organizing
and
nonorganizing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
some
person
who
seeks
employment
wants
to
try
to
decertify
the
union?
he's
not
a
member
of
the
union.
he's
just
trying
to
decertify
it,
if
the
board
applied
the
same
standard
to
them
as
they
do
to
the
salted
organizer,
they
would
be
impartial,
would
they
not?
granted
there
may
not
be
too
many
of
the
former
species.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
requires
a
thoroughly
obnoxious
organizer,
i
guess--
[laughter]
--who
is
apt
not
to
have
much
success,
i
would
think,
in
organizing
for
the
union.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pease.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
