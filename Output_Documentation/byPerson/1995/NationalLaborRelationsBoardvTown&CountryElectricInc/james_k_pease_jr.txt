mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
question
of
whether
the
board,
instead
of
protecting
the
freedom
of
employees
to
choose
to
be
unionized
or
not
to
be
unionized,
departed
from
its
role
as
impartial
referee
in
the
contest
or
conflict
between
employers
and
unions
for
the
votes
of
employees,
and
interpreted
section
2(3)
of
the
act
to
give
protected
status
to...
of
employee
to
union
agents
whose
job
was
to
be
the
arms,
the
eyes,
the
ears,
and
the
voice
of
the
union
on
the
employer's
crew,
and
who
were
prohibited
by
contract
from
exercising--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
your
honor,
the...
in
the
first
place,
the
conduct
was
not
limited
to
off
duty.
secondly--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--no.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
in
the
first
place,
that
distinction
is
only
material
if
that
person
is
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
if
a
supervisor
does
it
at
any
time,
that
person
can
be
fired.
if
someone
is
not...
does
not
have
the
status
of
employee--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--they
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act
at
any--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--the--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--i
believe
it
would
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
that
person
had
agreed
to
subject
themselves
to
the
control
of
the
union
just
like--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the...
it's
very
similar
to
the
issue
of
a
worker
who
accepts
the
responsibilities
of
a
foreman.
the
question
then
becomes,
have
they
taken
on
a
different
status,
and
it
depends
upon
whether
the
control...
whether
the...
this
person
who
had
been
working
as
an
employee
agreed
to
change
their
job,
to
take
as
their
primary
function--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--i
would
submit
that
if
that
person
had
subjected
themselves
to
the
control
of
the
union
and
had
similar...
had
obligations
similar
to
those
that
were
imposed
by
the
salting
resolution
in
this
case
that
would
give
the
union
primary
control
over
what
the
person
did--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--i
think
that
would
be
very
much
like
the
conflict
of
interest
that
a
lawyer
would
have
if
they
were
trying
to
suspend
their
representation
of
one
client
to
represent
the
opponent
for
a
meeting
or
for
a
hearing.
i
don't--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--if
they
accepted
the...
submitted--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
because
that
person
was...
had
withdrawn
his
services
from
the
employer,
that
there's
nothing...
there
is
not
a
conflicting
obligation
on
the
employee.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
don't...
i
believe
that
that's
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
type
of
situation
that
we
have
in
here,
where
you
have
someone
who
is
to
be
working
for
the
union
while
working
for
the...
actually
on
the
job
for
the
employer.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
as
long
as
that
agency
relationship
and
control
exists,
yes.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
correct.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
if
they
are
acting
within
the
consensual
relationship
of
the
collective
bargaining
relationship,
that's--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--that's
true,
but
that
is
normally
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
relationship.
i
believe
there's
a
sixth
circuit
case
in
bechtel
that
said
that
where,
in
fact,
the
union
controlled
the
steward,
that
it
was
a
violation
of
302
for
the
employer--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
distinction
is
based
on,
going
back
to
the
definition
of
employee.
the
statute
starts,
the
foundation
of
it
is
the
word
employee.
the
circular
definition
incorporates
the
concept
of
the
employment
relationship,
the
agency
relationship,
and
i
believe
that's
the
distinction
that
congress
is
making,
is
where
there
is
this
agency
relationship
that's
inconsistent--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--it
is,
because--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--in
the
first
instance,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
motivation
of
the
employee
differs
from
the
motivation
of
this...
these
union
agents.
union
agents
have
no
concern
whatsoever
about
whether
or
not
the
employer
likes
them,
or
whether
they're
doing
good
work
for
that
employer,
because
they're
not
dependent
upon
that
employer's
compensation.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
no.
i...
i
don't
mean
to
say
that.
what
i
was...
meant
to
say
was
that
the
employee
is
amenable
to
discipline
because
they
want
to
keep
their
job,
and
they're
concerned
about
getting
a
reference
in
the
future,
so
they're
concerned
about
what
the
employer
thinks
about
them,
and
they
are
amenable
to--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--but
i
think
that
because
you're
having
them
focus
on
simultaneously
doing
and
serving
conflicting
interests,
i
think
it's
that
simultaneous
conflict--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
he
never
had
been
employed
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
of
that
conflict,
and
that
also
points
out
the
fact
that
he
could
very
well--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--it's
the
same
conflict.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
don't
have
a
good
answer
for
that,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
would
submit
that
frequently
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
union
to
have
the
organizer
fired,
so
that
they
can
file
unfair
labor
practices,
because
if
they
can
get
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
find
that
the
employer
is
a
violator
and
that
there
is
substantial
monetary
damages,
they
can
much
more
effectively
and
much
more
quickly
get
what
their
goal
is,
which
is
a
labor
agreement,
than
they
can
if
they
go
through
the
democratic
processes
of
the
act.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
well...
well,
that
may
be
true,
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
think
that
in
this
case
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
he
did
work
poorly.
the
administrative
law
judge
discredited
that--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--well--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--and
the...
the
nlrb
ruled
against
the
employer,
as
they
generally
would
in
this
sort
of
a
case
where
there's
an
overt
organizer,
because
they
would
say
that
the
employer
is
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
known
union
activity.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--that's
correct.
that
is,
in
this
day
of
limited
skilled
and
technical
people,
that's
a
very
difficult
policy
to
maintain,
because
there
are
many
people
who
have
no
conflict
of
interest
who
would
work,
and
be
willing
to
work,
and
would
perform
a
valuable
service
to
the
employer,
and
the
employer
is
unable
to
utilize
them
if
they
have
this
broad,
sweeping
rule.
there's
also
the
problem
of
temporary
employment
agencies
that
frequently
provide
employees,
or
people
to
work,
supplement
the
crews.
you'd
be
precluded
from
using
them.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
congress
made
that
distinction
by
incorporating
the
law
of
agency
into
the
definition
of
employee.
that
zealot,
as
i
understand
your
fact
situation,
would
not
be
acting
as
an
agent
of
another
party,
and
therefore
would
not
be
outside
the
definition
of
employee.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
you
could
be.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
but
i
think
there
has
to
be
the--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--it
has
to
be
a
contract.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
believe--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
believe
that
the...
under
the
darden
case,
that
this
court
has
held
that
when
congress
uses
a
circular
definition
of
employee,
they
intend
to
incorporate
the
law
of
agency
into
that
definition,
and
i
think
that's
what
they
did
in
this
case.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
concept
there,
though,
is
if
that
is
a
pervasive...
if
it
is
a
general
control
that
is
being
exercised
by
the
union--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--okay,
there
are
several
areas
of
control.
first
of
all...
and
these,
i
think,
illustrate
the
conflict.
one
has
already
been
mentioned...
leaving.
it's
a
critical
time.
the
salt
must
leave,
the
zealous
union
organizer
at
least
may
be
amenable
to
a
plea
by
the
employer
to
stay,
at
least
during
the
critical
time,
so
they
don't
get
a
bad
reputation
and
have--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--that's
correct,
but
they're
exercising
their
free
will
in
making
the
change.
here,
it's
an
order
from
the
union.
i
think
that's
the
basic
distinction
that
congress
is
making
by
their
use
of
the
circular
definition.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
don't...
i
believe
that
it's
because
it's
contrary
to
the
interests
of
the
employer.
it's
to
the
interests
of
the
employer
to
have
that
employee
continue
to
work
during
a
concrete
pour,
or
some
other
critical
stage
of
the
work.
if
this
is
just
a
voluntary
union
organizer,
that
person
may
be
amenable
to
persuasion
from
the
employer
about
how
critical
that
work
is.
if
it's
an
agent
of
the
union,
they
have
no
choice.
they
have
to
leave
immediately,
and
i
believe
that's...
i
think
that's
the
distinction.
the
board
argues
that
the
statute
includes
the
entire
class
of
workers.
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
i
think
that
the
board
routinely
makes
distinctions
between
employees
and
nonemployees
in
enforcing,
or
interpreting
this
court's
decision
in
lechmere,
and
i
think
the
hearst
case,
referred
to
by
the
board,
holds
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
have
a
sweeping
inclusion
of
a
class
of
employees,
and
i
think
that
the
sunland
exceptions
that
was
discussed
earlier
is
really
insupportable.
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
valid
distinction
between
what
the
union
agent
can
do
in
a
nonstrike
setting
as
compared
to
what
they
would
do
in
a
strike
setting.
i
think
that
the
analysis
is
the
same,
and
i
think
that
that
illustrates
the
invalidity
of
the
board's
position
in
this
case,
and
indeed--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--it
was
that
the
employer
had
no
duty,
they
did
not
specifically
say
that
they
were
not
employees,
but
i
believe
that
the
analysis
is
the
same
analysis
that
i'm
urging.
it's
essentially
an
agency
relationship.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
no,
i...
the
phelps
dodge
case,
i
think
that
if
they
would
have
been
a
bona
fide
employee
as--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--if
they
were
employed,
they
would
be
bona
fide
applicants.
if
they're
not...
they
wouldn't
be,
then
they
wouldn't
be
bona
fide.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding
of
their
position.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
board
is
due
deference
when
their
interpretation
is
reasonable
and
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
act.
i
do
not
believe
that
it's
reasonable
for
the
board
to
exclude
the
definition...
from
the
definition
of
employee
the
law
of
agency.
i
believe
if
you
read
the
definition
of
the
law
of
agency,
the
congress
intended
to
retain
the
core
of
the
employment
relationship
as
the
basis
for
protection
under
the
act,
and
i
think
that
the
analysis
that
they
have
used
in
effect
would
even
exclude
the
managerial
employee,
and
i
don't
see
that
as
being--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--i
believe
that
by
including
a
circular
definition,
they
did
intend
to
include
the
law
of
agency
into
the
definition
of
employee,
and
i--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--i
do
believe
there
is
room
for
interpretation,
and
i
believe
that
congress
did
intend
to
expand
on
the
law...
on
the
law
of
agency
by
adding
the
language
that
it's
not
limited
to
an
employee
of
any
particular
employer,
because
i
think
they
wanted
to
include
employees
in
several
different...
with
several
different
employers
in
an
industry.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
i
believe...
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
think
it
is
is
that
when
congress
went
on
to
explain
in
the
definition
of
employee,
they
said
that
it
included
individuals
who
were
out
of
work,
or
whose
work
ceased
because
of
a
current
labor
dispute,
or
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
who
had
not
obtained
regular
and
substantially
equivalent
employment,
which
implies
that
there
are
other
situations
which
would
not
be
included,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
it
does
is,
it
shows
that
they
were
trying
to
take...
retain
the
core.
plus
i
believe
that
i
think
that
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
is
inconsistent
with
the
policies
of
the
act.
i
believe
that
the
act
says
that
the
purpose...
its
purpose
is
to
protect
the
right
to
organize,
and
the
board
at
page
8
of
its
brief
says
that
they
interpret
it
as,
that
it's
to
promote
organization,
and
i
would
submit
that
what
the
board
is
doing
in
that
situation
is
it
is
saying
that
there
is
a
preferred
choice,
and
that
they
are
going
to
go
out
and
support
that,
and
to
give
the
status
of
employee
to
a
person
who's
contractually
prohibited
from
exercising
the
rights
of
an
employee
under
section
7
of
the
act,
and
i
think
that
that's
inconsistent
with
the
1947
amendments
to
the
act
that
said
that
employees
had
the
right
to
refrain
from
any
of
those
activities.
i
think
that
that
set
up
two
equally
acceptable
choices,
and
the
board
was
supposed
to
be
an
impartial
referee,
and
i
believe
in
this
case,
they
have
moved
from
that
position,
and
for
that
reason
i
don't
think
that
they
have
due
deference.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
what
they're
doing
is,
they're
giving
their
stamp
of
approval
in
requiring
the
employer
to
put
the
union
on
the
employer's
crew.
this
person
is
an
agent
of
the
union,
and
they're
requiring
to
put
him
on
the
crew,
which
could
mean
that
if
he's
not
detected,
he
could
pack
the
unit,
or
they
could...
the
union
in
effect
is
buying
votes,
or
the
employees
are
deceived
into
believing
that
this
is
someone
who
is
sincerely
expressing
their
own
personal
convictions
and
in
fact
they're
doing
it
for
pay,
or
this
person
may
even
engage
in--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
issue
would
only
come
up
if
this
person
was
acting
on
behalf
of
some
third
party
and
there
was
an
agency
relationship--
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
that's
true,
very
possible,
and
that
is
a
point
i
would
like
to
make.
this
is
something
that
doesn't
just
apply,
or
the
holding
in
this
case
will
not
just
apply
in
the
construction
industry,
if
i'm
understanding
the
board's
position.
this
could
apply
in
all
industries,
and
it
could
apply
in
a
situation
where
the
fact...
the
employer
was
already
unionized
by
one
union
and
it
could
be
another
union
that's
coming
in
to
try
to
take
it
away.
i
think
that
the
point
that
has
been
made...
it's
made
in
willmar,
and
it's
a
point
that
i
would
like
to
address.
i
touched
on
it
earlier.
i
believe
that
the
board
is
assuming
that
the
union
agents
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act,
and
that
their
analysis
begins
with
the
premise
that
these
people
are
employees
and
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act,
and
then
the
question
becomes,
have
they
done
something
to
lose
that
protection?
i
would
submit
to
you
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
assume
that
they
are
employees
and
to
make
this
status
determination
as
we
make
it
in
other
instances
of
supervisors,
independent
contractors,
make
that
independent
of
the
presumptions
of
protected
activity,
independent
of
the
motive
of
the
employer
for
engaging
in
activity
that
raises
the
question.
it's
a
status
question,
and
therefore
we
would
submit
that
it's
inappropriate.
oh,
just
one
more
comment.
i
think
that
the
control
that
the
union
exercised
over
the
union
agent
in
this
case
is
illustrated
by
the
supernatural
persistence
he
displayed
in
soliciting
town
&
country
employees
in
the
face
of
repeated
rejection.
these
employees
were
so
upset
by
the
pressure
that
the
union
agent
was
putting
on
them
that
they
were
on
the
verge
of
quitting,
and
this
is
another
way
that
the
union
can
be
effective
without
going
the
high
road,
because
they
can
focus
on
those
employees
who
are
opposed
to
unionization
and
in
effect
force
them
off
the
work
force,
which
means
either
that
they
will
be
replaced
by
someone
who
might
be
more
favorable,
or
that
they
may
make
it
impossible
for
the
employer
to
perform,
and
that
nonunion
employer
is
off
the
job.
mr.
james
k.
pease,
jr.
but
the
problem
is,
your
honor,
that
frequently
the
objective
is
not
to
organize
in
the
classical
sense.
i
think
that
is
another
fallacy.
it
is
not
appropriate
to
assume
that
the
objective
may
be
to
organize.
the
objective
may
be,
as
suggested
by
joel
harmatz
in
the
sunland
case,
to
inflict
economic
pain,
so
that
they
can
get
leverage
on
the
employer
to
force
them
to
sign
a
contract
or
keep
them
out
of
the
area,
and
that
unfortunately
is
what
we
find
frequently
happens
throughout
the
case.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
i
believe
the
sunland
case,
the
board's
analysis
in
that
case
is
insupportable,
and
i
believe
that
using
a
similar
analysis,
an
analysis
that
we
espouse,
that
the
law
of
agency
should
be
used
to
interpret
the
status
of
people
and
determine
whether
they're
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
employees,
and
that
the
board
should
abandon
this
position
and
should
return
to
a
position
of
impartiality
that
was
intended
by
congress.
thank
you.
