i'm
not
sure,
mr.
wallace,
that
i
fully
understand
your
example,
or
your
statement,
or
your
concession
that
an
employer
with
a
neutral
purpose,
let's
say,
can
ask,
do
you
have
any
conflicting
obligations
to
any
other
employer
or
organization?
now,
suppose
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
i'm
a
member
of
the
union,
and
i'll
strike
if
they
tell
me
to
do
that.
i
suppose
he's
mandatorily
entitled
to
employment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
an
employer
interprets
it
that
way.
it
isn't
because
of
the
labor
laws,
the
national
labor
relations
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
think
you
have
to
amend
your
statement
to
say
that
if
the
reason
for
an
affirmative
answer
to
the
question,
do
you
have
a
conflicting
obligation,
is
a
primary
loyalty
to
the
union
that
that
is
a
supervening
reason
that
entitles
the
employee
to
be
hired,
i
should
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
that
would
be
an
ongoing
strike.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
surely
you
don't
mean
that
union
membership,
which
imposes
certain
duties
which
can
be
enforced,
i
take
it,
by
a
cause
of
action
for
damages,
et
cetera,
is
grounds
for
nonemployment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
would
not
anticipate
the
board
could
do
that
consistently
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
like
to
clear
up
just
one
small
point.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
shop
steward
unless
there's
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
