justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
wallace,
can
an
employer
legitimately
adopt
a
hiring
policy
to
the
effect
that
we
will
not
hire
anyone
who
moonlights
for
another
employer,
or
who
has
another
job,
including
a
job
for
the
union,
it's
just
our
policy
not
to
hire
people
who
do
have,
or
may
have
a
second
job?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
if...
presumably
there
could
be
such
an
employer
policy,
and
it
could
include
even
employment
by
the
union,
as
in
this
context.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
basically
saying
that
even
under
those
circumstances,
the
person
could
no
longer
be
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
i
mean,
that's
what
it
sounds
like
in
your
response.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
a
striking
worker
who
accepts
union...
follows
the
union
order
to
strike,
accepts
benefits
from
the
union,
and
so
forth,
not
an
employee
under
your
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
the
rank
and
file
employee
who
is
a
union
member,
and
who
has
already
agreed
in
advance
by
being
a
union
member
that
if
the
union
requires
him
to
strike,
he
will,
and
furthermore,
if
the
union
provides
benefits
during
a
strike,
he'll
take
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
pease,
presumably
the
employer
could
make
a
broad
policy
in
hiring
people
that
the
employer
won't
hire
anyone
who
has
a
second
job.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
employer
didn't
have
that
rule.
