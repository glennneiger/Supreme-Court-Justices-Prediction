even
if
the
employer
never...
it's
true
if
the
employer
doesn't
know
about
it,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
guy
never
was
an
employee.
he
worked
there
5
years,
he
got
paid
every
day,
and
build
all
the
things
he
was
supposed
to
build,
he
never
was
an
employee
because
he
had
this
secret
loyalty
to
some
other
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
essential
to
your
position
that
the
conflict
be
with
the
union,
or...
say
it
was
a
competitor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
he
promised
his
wife
he'd
quit
as
soon
as
she
told
him
to.
[laughter]
it's
a
dangerous
job.
it
could
happen.
he's
a
pilot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
the
same.
he's
not
an
employee.
wouldn't
it
be
a
rather
bad
organizer...
if
the
organizer
came
there
and
didn't
do
a
good
job,
isn't
there...
matching
your
incentive,
i
don't
care
because
i'm
being
paid
by
somebody
else,
in
fact,
isn't
there
a
harmony
of
these
interests,
because
in
order
to
organize,
the
union
person
has
got
to
keep
that
job,
and
if
he
gives
cause
to
be
discharged,
he's
not
going
to
be
a
very
effective
organizer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me
about
the
sunland
case?
did
the
sunland
case
hold
that
the
people
involved
were
not
employees,
or
that
it
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
discriminate
against--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
also
clarify
one
thing
in
my
own
mind.
in
this
case,
there
was
one
person
who
actually
went
to
work
for
the
employer,
and
there
are
seven
or
eight
who
never
got
hired,
as
i
remember
it.
you
don't
draw
a
distinction
between
those
two.
you
don't
challenge
the
phelps
dodge
case,
in
other
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they'd
been
hired.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
the
same
rule
as
to
both
groups.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
rival
union,
perhaps.
