in
deciding
the
definition
of
employee,
should
we
defer
to
the
board?
that
is,
i
know
hearst
did
defer,
and
then
in
united
insurance,
it
said
congress
amended
the
statute,
but
it
amended
the
statute
only
in
respect
to
an
independent
contractor,
and
the
particular
aspect
of
the
employee
definition
here
doesn't
involve
that,
and
united
insurance
talks
about
that,
and
so
i
was
wondering,
do
you
think
maybe
we
should...
maybe
that
deference
notion
is
still
alive,
and
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
be
in
respect
to
other
aspects
of
the
definition.

yes,
but
that's
exactly
what's
bothering
me.
i
don't
want
to
say,
if
it's
not
right,
that
the
restatement
automatically
governs
in
these
nonindependent
contractor-related
areas.
if
the
board
were
to
choose
to
go
beyond
it,
i
mean,
a
holding
of
this
court
that
they
couldn't
might
be
a
problem,
and
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
