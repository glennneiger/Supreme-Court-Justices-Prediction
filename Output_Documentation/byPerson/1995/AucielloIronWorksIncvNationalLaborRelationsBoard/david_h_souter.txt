justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
could
have
done
that
by
withdrawing
your
offer.
you
could
have
sent
them
a
telegram
just
as
readily
as
they
sent
you
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
wish
you
had
done
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
you
could--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
when
the
point
comes
that
you're
questioning
the
union's
continuing
capacity
as
a
representative,
there's
going
to
be
a
certain
chill
upon
the
proceedings
anyway.
justice
david
h.
souter
you've
got
to
accept
that,
and
i
don't
see
that
the
chill
is
going
to
be
any
greater
by
withdrawing
the
offer
on
that
ground
than
it
is
by
doing
what
you
want
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
force
of
your
argument
somewhat
undercut
by
the
fact
that
the
board
is
reserving
the
question
of
what
the
result
should
be
if,
in
fact,
the
claim
was
and
was
proven
that
there
had
been
a
loss
of
majority
support?
because
one
of
your
arguments
is
there
is
need
to
have
a
bright
line
rule
for
the
sake
of
stability
and
industrial
peace
once
a
contract
has
been
formed,
but
now
i
understand
the
board
is
saying,
well,
we
reserve
the
question
whether
there
is
such
a
need
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
union
actually
had
lost
majority
support.
so
if...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
practical
effect
of
that
is
going
to
be
that
so
long
as
that
question
is
reserved,
that
any
employer
with
a
good
faith
doubt
is
going
to
make
in
good
faith
a
claim
that
in
fact
majority
support
was
withdrawn--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
there
goes
the
whole
need
for
the
bright
line...
or
the
whole
justification
based
on
a
bright
line
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
that
the
need
for
the
bright
line
is
still
there,
but
there
just
may
be
a
circumstance
in
which,
need
or
no
need,
we
simply
cannot
have
the
benefit
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but...
may
i
interrupt
you,
though?
that
would
not
be
the
case...
the
board
is
reserving
the
question,
as
i
understand
it,
whether
any
bright
line
rule
would
operate
upon
acceptance
if
it
can
be
shown
that
at
the
time
of
acceptance
majority
status
had
been
lost,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
okay.
