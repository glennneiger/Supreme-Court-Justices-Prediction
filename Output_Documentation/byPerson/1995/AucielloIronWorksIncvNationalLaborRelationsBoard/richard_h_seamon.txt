mr.
richard
h.
seamon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
narrow
issue
before
this
court
is
the
reasonableness
of
a
rule
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
concerns
the
timing
of
an
employer's
assertion
of
a
good
faith
doubt
a
union's
majority
status.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
justice
o'connor,
the
board
has
not
addressed
that
issue,
and
it
reserves
it
in
this
case.
it
would
obviously
present
very
different
considerations
in
light
of
decisions
such
as
ladies'
garment
workers,
but
we
emphasize
that
at
issue
in
this
case
is
only
a
claim
of
a
good
faith
doubt
of
majority
status.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
is
possible
but
i
would
emphasize
that
one
important
difference
to
which
justice
ginsburg
alluded
between
the
present
context
and
garment
workers
is
that
garment
workers
involved
a
voluntarily
recognized
union,
whereas
the
present
case
involves
a
union
that
was
certified
by
the
board.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
board
framed
its
rule
in
terms
of
a
previously
certified
union,
and
its
prior
decision
in
the
same
context
called
belcon
also
dealt
with
a
previously
certified
union.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
emphatically
so.
in
fact,
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
where
petitioner
had
an
opportunity
to
make
a
claim
of
an
actual
loss
of
majority
support,
it
failed
to
do
so.
in
its
answer
to
the
general
counsel's
complaint
of
an
unfair
labor
charge,
it
specifically
asserted
a
good
faith
doubt,
but
did
not
assert
a
loss
of--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--no,
that
is
also
inaccurate,
in
our
view.
in
the
objections
to
the
alj's
decision,
the
petitioner
only
complained
about
the
alj's
finding
regarding
its
failure
to
establish
a
good
faith
doubt,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
petition
appendix,
the
white
brief,
at
page
85a,
in
which
the
board,
in
delivering
its
first
decision
in
this
case,
stated,
we
agree
with
the
alj
that
under
established
board
precedent,
once--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i'm
reading
from
the
beginning
of
footnote
85,
on
page
85a.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
agree
with
the
judge
that,
under
established
board
precedent,
once
the
board
finds
that
the
parties
have
reached
a
binding
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
is
unnecessary
to
consider
the
issue
of
a
respondent's
alleged
good
faith
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status.
i
would
also
refer
the
court
to
page
54a
of
this
same
filing,
which
is
from
the
board's
second
supplemental
opinion
in
this
case.
on
page
55a,
the
very
last
sentence
in
the
footnote
states,
we
further
emphasize
that
the
case
before
us
does
not
involve
allegations
of
an
actual
loss
of
majority
status.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
this
is
the
board's
supplemental
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well,
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
board
has
developed
the
good
faith
doubt
rule
is
the
recognition
that
it
can
be
difficult,
in
the
absence
of
a
decertification,
to
prove
an
actual
loss
of
majority
status.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
labor
law
permitted
it
to
assert
a
good
faith
doubt,
but
it
also
required
it
to
take
other
steps
to
either
withdraw
its
offer
and
then
assert
the
good
faith
doubt
to
petition
for
an
election
before
the
new
agreement
was
entered
into
by
the
union's
acceptance
of
its
offer.
and
it
shouldn't
be
lost
sight
of
that
the
employees
themselves
had
an
opportunity
to
file
a
petition
for
decertification
during
the
window
period
from
60
to
90
days
before
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
expired
and
again
after
the
agreement
expired
and
before
a
new
one
was
entered
into.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i
acknowledge,
justice
souter,
that
one
of
the
difficulties
that
would
arise
from
creating
a
different
rule
for
claims
of
actual
loss
of
majority
status
from
the
rule
that
applies
to
good
faith
doubt
claims
is
that
employers
would
be
tempted
to
circumvent
it
by
a
mere
point
of
pleading,
to
say
not
only
did
i
have
a
good
faith
doubt,
but
i
also
believe
that
the
union
in
fact
lost
majority
status,
and
that
may,
in
fact,
be
a
consideration
that
the
board
could
validly
take
into
account
if
and
when
in
the
future
it
addresses
the
question
of
whether
the
rule
should
be
different.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
is
a
very
serious
question
for
the
reasons
elaborated
in
the
ladies'
garment
workers
decision.
again,
there
are
differences
between
that
decision
and
this
one,
but
obviously--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that
is
right,
and
again,
quite
apart
from
the
employer's
temptation
to
plead
an
actual
loss
of
majority
status,
it
is
perfectly
logical
for
the
board's
rule
to
operate
upon
the
acceptance
of
the
petitioner's
outstanding
contract
offer.
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
also
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
my
brother
at
the
bar
correctly
stated
the
posture
of
the
case
right
now.
it
is
under
submission
before
the
board
following
oral
argument,
which
occurred
about
a
year
ago,
but
i
would
say
it's
far
from
clear
whether
the
board
is
going
to
address
the
general
counsel's
argument
that
the
good
faith
doubt
rule
should
be
abandoned.
that
is
not
the
primary
argument
in
that
particular
case,
and
the
general
counsel
emphasizes
that
the
board
doesn't
need
to
address
it
at
all.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
uncertain
of
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
of
course,
they
do
from
time
to
time.
i
recognize
that
the
afl--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i
recognize
the
afl-cio
takes
the
position
that
the
pendency
of
lee
lumber
renders
the
grant
of
cert
improvident.
we...
in
our
judgment,
again,
it
is
so
unclear
whether
the...
how
the
board
is
going
to
rule
and
whether
it's
going
to
rule
that
that
alone
doesn't
weigh
against
the
grant,
but
by
the
same
token,
of
course,
we
wouldn't
oppose
dismissal
on
those
grounds.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well,
in
many
ways
the
most
sensible
approach,
and
the
approach
that
is
preferred
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
is
for
the
employer
to
file
a
petition
for
an
election,
assuming
that
the
employees
themselves
have
not
availed
themselves
of
that
right.
this
court
recognized
that
in
brooks,
and
it
also
recognized
that
the
reason
for
that
is
that
we
can
justifiably
be
concerned
about
employer's
attempts
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
employees,
especially
when
the
employees
themselves
have
ample
opportunity
to
assert
those
rights.
the
court
in
brooks
said,
in
fact,
that
allowing
employees
to
assert
the
rights
of
employees
was
not
conducive
to
industrial
peace,
it
is
inimical
to
it.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
is
not
necessarily
a
particularly
elaborate
procedure,
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
litigation
that
ensued
was
quite
as
extraordinary
as
it
would
have
been
had...
as
it
might
have
been
had
the
employer
taken
the
preferred
route
and
filed
the
petition
for
an
election
in
the
first
place.
and
it
also
bears
emphasizing
that
the
board's
rule
does
not
permanently
foreclose
an
employer
from
asserting
its
good
faith
doubt.
instead,
if
the
employer
fails
to
raise
the
doubt
before
an
employer
has
accepted
the
offer,
the
employer
simply
has
to
bid
his
time
during
the
contract
term.
when
the
contract
expires,
it
again
has
an
opportunity
to
assert
its
good
faith
doubt.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i'm
not
certain
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
would
suggest
that
there's
a
very
good
argument
that
they've
waived
the
argument
to
the
extent
that
the
board
made
it
quite
clear
in
both
of
its
decisions
that
it
considered
this
case
as
presenting
only
a
good
faith
doubt,
and
petitioner
could
have
sought
reconsideration
of
the
board's
decision
on
the
grounds
that
the
board
had
overlooked
one
of
its
claims,
but
it
failed
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right,
and
i
believe
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
ample
opportunity.
it
was
quite
clear...
it's
been
clear
since
the
celanese
corporation
decision
in
1951...
that
there
are
two
separate
claims
that
can
be
used
to
justify
refusal
to
bargain.
one
is
a
good
faith
doubt,
the
other
is
an
actual
loss
of
majority
status,
so
petitioner...
the
clarity
of
the
board's
precedent
can't
be
blamed
for
petitioner's
failure
to
raise
both
claims
if
it
thought
both
were
grounded
in
the
facts.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
did
not.
however,
the
second
board
decision
was
a
decision
by
the
full
board,
and
obviously,
in
general
those
take
longer
to
issue
than
decisions--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--of
the
four
panels,
and
i
would
suggest
the
other
consideration
may
well
have
been
that
the
first
circuit
outlined
a
number
of
very
specific
concerns
that
it
wanted
the
board
to
address
in
full
on
remand,
but
there's
no
specific
explanation--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--the
enforcement
order
is...
includes
a
usual
cease
and
desist
provision,
and
it
also
requires
petitioner
to
enter
into
a
contract
based
on
the
agreement
that
was
formed
when
the
union
accepted
petitioner's
contract.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that
will
mean
that
the
employees
should
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
all
of
the
wage
and
conditions
provisions
of
the
original
contract.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
three
years.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right,
and
i
suppose
since
the
employer
has
never
honored
the
agreement
it
is
still
open
for
it
to
be
required
to
do
so.
