justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
o'reilly,
would
you...
my
understanding
was
that
your
friends
at
the
afl-cio
took
the
position,
but
there's
only
one
way
to
establish
that
the
union
has
lost
its
majority,
and
that
is
through
a
secret
ballot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
also
said
in
their
brief
that
general
counsel
had
recommended
such
a
position
to
the
board.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
that
stand,
do
you
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you...
we...
you
are
going
in
this
case
on
the
proposition
that
there's
a
reasonable
doubt
rule,
so
that
the
question
is,
at
what
point
can
the
employer...
it's
really
a
timing
question.
i
think
the
reasonable
doubt...
i
think
you're
agreed,
are
you
not,
that
if
you
had
withdrawn
the
offer
on
the
18th
or
19th
on
the
basis
of
your
good
faith
doubt,
there
would
be
no
contract
that
they
could
accept.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
can't
the
board
say,
we
have
to
draw
the
line
some
place,
we're
going
to
draw
it
at
the
union's
acceptance
of
the
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
--well,
they
felt
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
o'reilly,
is
there
something
different
in
a
union
that
has
never
been
certified
by
the
board,
which
i
take
it
was
the
ilgwu
case,
where
there's
a
concern
that
maybe
it's
a
sweetheart
union,
and
here,
where
the
board
was...
the
union
was
certified
and
had
a
long-term
bargaining
relationship
with
the
company?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
employer
at
any
point
could
have
asked
for
a
new
election.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
instead
of
renewing
the
contract.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
respect
to
the
board,
they
did
this
twice
because
the
first
circuit
said
the
first
time
it
wasn't
good
enough.
what
deference,
if
any,
do
we
owe
to
the
board's
drawing
this
line
where
it
did
and
explaining
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there,
you're
taking
on
the
first
circuit,
too,
which
decided
it
was
rational.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is--
--but
that's
a
question
for
the
board,
because
isn't
there
some
doubt
as
to
what
extent
the
government
can
bind
an
employee
to
be
represented
by
a
union
that
in
fact
does
not
occupy
majority
status?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
reservation
also
would
be
overtaken
if
the
general
counsel's
lee
lumber
proposal
is
adopted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
you...
can
you
give
us
any
representation
of
where
that
proceeding
stands?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
seamon,
wouldn't
that
be
a
burden
for
a
small
company
like
this?
there's
only
23
employees.
wouldn't
it
be
an
expense?
they've
got
to
hire
a
lawyer
to
petition
the
board
for
an
election.
