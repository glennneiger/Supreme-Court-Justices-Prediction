mr....
krischer,
is
it?
excuse
me,
mr.
o'reilly--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--are
you
making
any
claim
here
that
the
union
in
fact
lacked
majority
support
at
the
time
the
union
accepted
the
offer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
issue
in
front
of
us,
do
you
think,
properly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
board
deal
with
the
case
in
that
posture,
or
not?
i
somehow
thought
that
we
had
before
us
a...
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
good
faith
doubt,
not
whether
there
was
in
fact
lack
of
support.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
issues
are
quite
different,
possibly,
and
i
wonder
if
we
aren't
bound
by
how
the
question
is
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
effect
of
that
case
from
this
court
in
'61,
the
international
ladies'
garment
workers
union
case,
where
presumably
we
held
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
enter
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
a
union
that
in
fact
lacks
majority
support?
is
that
good
law
as
far
as
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
do
you
think
it's
open
to
the
board
to
alter
that
rule
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
would
the
situation
be,
mr.
seamon,
if,
in
fact,
there
were
no
majority
support
at
the
time
the
union
tried
to
accept
the
offer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
possible
that
if
in
fact
there
was
no
majority
support
that
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
employer
to
enter
the
contract?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
anything
in
the
opinion
that
made
it
turn
on
that,
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
your
position
that
the
pleadings
in
this
case
did
not
raise
the
in
fact
lack
of
support
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
its
briefs
below,
it
tried
to
present
that
issue?
