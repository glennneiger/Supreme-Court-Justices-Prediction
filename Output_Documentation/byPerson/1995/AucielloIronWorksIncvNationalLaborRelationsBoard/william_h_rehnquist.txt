chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-668,
auciello
iron
works,
inc.
v.
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
o'reilly,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
may
be
any
number
of
facts
in
the
case
that
are
not
before
us.
your
question
presented
is
whether
an
employer
is
bound
by
a
union's
acceptance
of
an
earlier
proposal
for
a
collective...
when
at
the
time
of
the
union's...
the
employer
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
a
good-faith
doubt
of
the
union's
continued
majority
status.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
that
as
raising
the
question
in
fact
as
to
whether
the
union
had
lost
its
majority
status.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
way
you
describe
it,
it
sounds
as
though
at
least
the
administrative
law
judge's
ruling
was
that
even
though
you
had
been
able
to
prove
that
there
was
no
majority
support,
it
was
irrelevant,
and
yet
i
understood
you
to
say
the
board
took
no
position
if
you
could
prove
that
fact.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
on
page
3a
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
o'reilly?
the
middle
of
the
page.
i
think
i
see--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
middle
of
the
page.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
you
raised
it
to
the
board,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
the
board
refuse
to
consider
it
because
you
hadn't
raised
it
in
your
answer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
o'reilly.
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
on
the
page
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
seamon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
is
the
board's
opinion,
65a.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
gestation
period
for
a
proceeding
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
avents
took
place
in
1988,
so
it
may
be
a
little
late
to
go
back
and
argue
about
the
thing,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
mr.
o'reilly,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'reilly.
the
case
is
submitted.
