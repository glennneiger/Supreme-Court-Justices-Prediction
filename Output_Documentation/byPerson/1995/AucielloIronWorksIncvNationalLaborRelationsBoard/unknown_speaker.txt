the
acceptance
was
a
logical
point
for
cutting
off
consideration
of
claims
of
good
faith
doubt,
because
it
was
that
point
in
this
case
that
ended
the
strike
and
restored
productivity
at
the
plant,
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
is
an
event
of
central
importance.
more
generally,
when
unions
accept
contract
offers
from
employers,
that
marks
a
fundamental
alteration
in
the
relationship
between
the
parties.
after
that
point,
it
is
reasonable
for
the
board
to
require
the
parties
to
accept
the
results
of
the
process
and
get
back
to
the
productive
enterprise
in
which
they
both
have
such
an
important
interest.
i
would
also
suggest
that
in
any
event
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
decide
whether,
in
lieu
of
a
bright
line,
the
board
should
have
adopted
a
rule
that
would
require
it
to
determine
in
every
case
whether
the
employer
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
investigate
and
to
voice
its
good
faith
doubt,
because
petitioner
did
have
such
an
opportunity.
most
or
all
of
the
evidence
on
which
it
premised
its
good
faith
doubt
was
received
6
days
before
the
union
accepted
petitioner's
contract
offer,
and
has
arisen
earlier
in
the
argument.
at
any
time,
petitioner
had
the
option
of
withdrawing
its
offer.
it
also
could
have
petitioned
for
an
election.
it
didn't
take
any
of
these
options,
nor
did
it
break
off
negotiations
and
take
its
offer
off
the
table.
it
may
ultimately
be
for
the
board
to
balance,
but
the
rule
that
it's
adopted
almost
encourages
employers
to
continue
making
allegations
as
to
good
faith
doubts
and
disrupting
the
bargaining
process.
it
seems
to
me
much
more
sensible
to
do
it
post
hoc.

the
board's
rule
serves
the
interest
in
repose
for
the
most
part
by
drawing
a
bright
line
after
which
the
parties
are
required
to
accept
the
results
of
the
negotiation
process,
and
it
also
prevents
sand-bagging,
which
can
occur
where
an
employer
decides
that
it
is
going
to
keep
its
doubts
regarding
the
union's
majority
status
to
itself
during
the
negotiation
process
and
raise
them
after
an
agreement
has
been
concluded
if
it
decides
in
hindsight
that
the
agreement
is
not
to
its
liking.
we're
not
suggesting
that
that
was
operative
here,
and
that
it
is
a
very
real
concern
in
the
general
run
of
cases.
