justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
that
their
basis
is
not
a
telegram,
their
basis
is
a
contract,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
once
the
contract
is
created--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
can't
question
it
for
the
period
of
the
contract
bar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
doesn't...
i
mean,
what
is
illogical
about
saying
there's
a
contract
bar,
it
starts
when
the
contract
was
created?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
have
a
complaint
about
the
union,
make
it
before
the
contract
is...
after,
you're
barred.
that's
the
contract
bar,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
rule,
and
why
is
that
illogical?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
why...
is...
are
you
saying
the
contract
bar
rule
is
unlawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
contract
bar
rule
has
to
start
somewhere.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
and
i
take
it
it's
up
to
the
board,
basically,
to
say
where
it
starts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
even
if
they've
lost
their
majority
status
during
the
time
of
the
contract,
and
different
people,
people
come
in
and
say,
look,
we
represent
the
workers
now,
junk
that,
you
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
principle
has
to
start
some
place,
so
i
want
to
see
what's
wrong,
what's
illogical
about
starting
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
from
time
to
time.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
the
board
rules
permit
this
particular
employer
to
go
back
and
raise
the
other
half
of
the
claim,
or
has
it
lost...
have
they
lost
that?
i
mean,
i
take
it
initially
they
thought
there
was
just
going
to
be
one
rule,
actual
good
faith
the
same,
and
then
they
found
out
there
wasn't.
there's
a
division...
good
faith,
they
lose,
actual,
we
haven't
decided.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
the
board
rules
permit
them
to
go
back
now,
or
not?
