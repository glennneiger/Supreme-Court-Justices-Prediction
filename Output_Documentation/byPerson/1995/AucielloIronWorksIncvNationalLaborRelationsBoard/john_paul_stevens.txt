justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
correctly?
if
you
did
review
it
thoroughly
and
concluded...
and
assume
the
facts
are
that,
even
though
you
had
your
doubts,
that
there
still
was
majority
support
for
the
union,
why
is
it
all
unfair?
if
the
other
had
happened,
if
you
had
been
able
to
prove
there
was
not,
your
doubt
was
correct,
even
though
they'd
accepted
the
offer
you
could
get
out
of
it,
couldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
even
if
you
didn't
move
quickly
enough,
if
your
doubts
had
been
substantiated
by
your
thorough
investigation
on
monday
and
tuesday,
you
still
would
have
been
protected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
if
you
could
prove
they
did
not
have
a
majority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
had
a
good
faith
doubt,
i
understand
that,
but
did
you
also
try
to
prove
that
there
was
on
fact
no
majority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
there
a
finding
on
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
apart
from
the
question
presented,
may
i
ask
you
where
in
the
papers
before
us
is
there
either
a
pleading
or
an
argument
by
you
or
your
client
that
there
was,
in
fact,
no
majority
status?
do
the
papers
anywhere
show
that
you
made
that
argument
and
preserved
it
in
a
pleading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
where?
justice
john
paul
stevens
3a,
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
white
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
petition,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
preceding
sentence
says
that
the
board
affirmed
the
alj's
refusal
to
consider
the
company's
defense
that
at
the
time
the
union
accepted
the
company's
contract
proposal,
the
company
entertained
a
good
faith
doubt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
describes
your
defense
as
one
that
they...
that
you
entertained
a
good
faith
doubt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
saying
there
was
an
additional
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
i
realize
you
have
the
same
evidence,
but
is
there
some
pleading
that
you
filed
in
which
you
said
one
of
your
defenses
is
they
in
fact
did
not
have
majority
status?
justice
john
paul
stevens
forgetting
the
briefs
for
a
minute,
how
about
your
pleading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
term
of
the
original
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
3
years,
of
course,
has
long
expired.
