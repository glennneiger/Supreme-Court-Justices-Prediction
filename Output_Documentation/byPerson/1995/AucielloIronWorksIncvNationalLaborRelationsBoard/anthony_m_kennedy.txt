but
that
gets
us
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
that
i
don't
think
you
fully
answered.
the
point
was,
why
not
make
the
contract
bar
rule
become
effective
upon
the
acceptance
of
a
contract?
we
know
when
contracts
are
accepted,
we
know
when
they're
not.
why
not
make
that
the
bright
line
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
employers
ever
appended
to
their
offer
clause
that
says,
if
you
accept
this
offer,
execution
of
the
contract
will
be
subject
to
our
determining
within
7
days
that
you
continue
to
have
a
majority
status?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
would
be
no
bar
in
labor
law
from
appending
such
a
clause
to
an
offer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
the
only
way
we
really
know
that
the...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
we
know
in
a
legal
sense
that
the
board...
that
the
union
doesn't
have
majority
status
is
that
there's
been
a
certification,
or
decertification
petition
and
an
election,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
employer
is
being
put
in
a
very
difficult
position
here
where
it
makes
the
quite
careful,
measured
statement
that
it
has
good
faith
doubt,
which
is
a
term
of
art
in
the
labor
law,
and
then
you
fault
him
for
not
saying
that
he
knew.
it
really
amounts
to
a
very
trivial
difference,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
employer
acted
quite
consistently
with
the
dictates
of
the
labor
board
and
the
dictates
of
the
labor
law
in
that
regard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
at
stake
here
as
of
this
point?
what
does
the
enforcement
order
provide?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
will
that
mean
back
pay,
or
what?
