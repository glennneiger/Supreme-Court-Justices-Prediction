mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
some
8
years
ago
we
started
what
i
thought
was
a
run-of-the-mill,
garden-variety
type
labor
dispute
which
has
grown
and
grown,
and
here
we
are.
in
the
course
of
a
collective
bargaining
dispute,
the...
a
strike
arose;
picketing
took
place.
immediately
during
the
course
of
this
garden-variety
dispute,
40
percent
of
the
employees,
the
bargaining
unit,
crossed
the
line,
the
same
40
percent
which,
it's
a
small
unit,
that
40
percent
is
only
9
employees,
were
badmouthing
the
union.
the
employer,
during
the
course
of
this
5
or
6-week
strike,
obtained
the
belief
that
because
of
the
40
percent
the
union
did
not
have
the
tremendously
strong
percentage
of
support,
and
it
shot
across
the
bow
of
the
union
bargaining
position
a
rather
extreme
shot.
it
beefed
up
its
contract
proposal.
however,
the
significant
point,
when
it
beefed
it
up,
it
did
not
have,
then,
reason
to
believe
that
the
union
was
not
a
majority
representative.
it
had
every
reason...
in
fact,
the...
it
would...
to
believe
that
the
union
still
maintained
its
majority
status,
but
it
shot
this
across
the
bow
of
the
union,
this
beefed-up
union
proposal,
and
at
that
time
the
negotiations
are
broken
off.
the
very
next
day,
the
union
abandoned
the
picket
line,
the
pickets
went
down,
and
a
number
of
extraordinary
events
took
place
over
the
next
3
business
days.
everyone...
almost
everyone
came
back
to
work.
of
those
who
came
back
to
work,
a
number
of
them
did
the
same
as
their
predecessors,
the
40
percent
who
had
come
back
earlier,
had
crossed
the
picket
line,
were
knocking
the
union,
being
very
critical
of
the
union.
in
fact,
four
additional
employees
resigned
from
the
union
after
they
came
back,
spoke
to
company
representatives
and
said,
we
don't
need
the
union,
i
don't
know
why
we
wanted
a
union
in
the
first
place.
three
of
these
individuals
who
were
thus
bad-mouthing
the
union
had
been
picketing
that
friday
morning.
friday
afternoon
they
were
in
saying
to
the
company,
ah,
we
never
needed
a
union
here
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
o'reilly.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
have
been
making
that
claim
not
only
today
but
for
the
last
8
years.
i
know
the
issue
has
been
raised
in
respondent's--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--i
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
particularly,
i--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
i
believe
you
have
both
issues
before
you.
the
facts
clearly
indicate...
for
instance,
the
company's
telegram
that
it
sent
eventually,
in
response
to
the
union's
sunday
evening
telegram
said
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
union
no
longer
represents
a
majority.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
well,
of
course,
in
fact
that
was...
mr.
chief
justice,
that
was
raised
in
our
original
answer
to
the
complaint
8
years
ago
at
the
labor
board.
we
also
used
the
phrase,
good
faith
doubt,
and
the
reason
we
did
is
because
it's
easier
for
an
employer
to
defend
and
to
prove
its
defense
by...
through
circumstantial
evidence
of
creating
a
good
faith
doubt,
but
we
did--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--i
think
the
issues
may
vary,
but
i...
in
this
particular
case
i
think
they're
so
closely
intertwined
that
they
can
be
treated
as
one
and
the
same.
for
instance,
the
court
of
appeals,
who
heard...
of
the
first
circuit
heard
this
case
twice,
and
both
in
their
first
decision,
as
well
as
in
their
second
decision,
they
treated
it,
notwithstanding
the
original
issue
having
been
framed
as
a
good
faith
doubt
case,
they
treated
it
in
both
decisions
as
a
question
of
the
employer
attempting
to
prove
before
the
administrative
law
judge
and
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
in
fact
the
union
had
lost
its
majority
status.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
no,
i
think
the
only
difference,
justice
scalia,
would
be
if
we,
the
employer,
had
raised
and
proved...
established
at
the
trial
level
that
we
had
a
good
faith
doubt,
it
would
then
be
incumbent
upon
general
counsel
to
establish
that
in
fact
the
union
had
maintained
a
majority--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--no,
as
i
understand
the
board
decision,
they
would...
decisions,
they
would
take
the
position
that
if
we
had
established
under
the
facts
of
this
case
actual
loss
of
majority,
or
at
least
my
friends
at
the--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--afl-cio
in
their
amicus
brief
said
that
would
be
enough.
the
board
has
reserved
in
this
case--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--its
position
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
actual
loss
of
majority
would
have
entitled
us,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
to
send...
fire
back
that
reply
telegram
disavowing
any
further
obligations--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--i
suspect
it
is,
but
we
feel
the
result
would
be
the
same
under
both
scenarios.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
they...
justice
ginsburg,
they
took
the
same
position,
of
course,
and
filed
an
almost
identical
brief
in
the
curtin
matheson
case,
saying
that
the
board
rule
that
this
court
has
implicitly
affirmed
over
the
years,
the
board
rule
that
a
good
faith
doubt
entitles
you
to
withdraw
your
recognition
of
the
union,
they
took
the
position
in
that
case
and
in
the
amicus
in
this
case
that
that
is
no
longer
a
good
rule,
and
that
the
only
way
an
employer
can
contest
the
majority
status
of
an
incumbent
union
is
to
file
a
decertification
petition,
and
i--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--well--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--my
understanding,
i've
had
an
opportunity
to
look
into
that.
i
contacted...
and
i
can
only
reflect
was
i
was
told
by
the
employer's
counsel
in
that
case,
that
the...
and
there
is
a
board
decision
some
3
years
ago
in
that
case.
it
was
on
appeal
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
and
the
board
then
requested
that
it
be
referred
back
to
the
board.
counsel
for
the
employer
indicated
that
all
argument
in
that
case
was
conducted
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
and
no
decision
has
come
out
of
it.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
well,
i
would
just
suggest
if
you
look
at
the...
if
my--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--but
i'm
not
sure
what
the
likelihood
is
of
the
board
adopting
that
particular
view
of
the
scenario
i
just
described.
this
case
was
decided
within
the
last
year.
oral
argument
in
the
lee
lumber
case
was
a
year-and-a-half
ago.
the
board
certainly
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
adopt
the
general
counsel's
position
in
the
meantime
and
at
least,
certainly
in
this
case,
deny
it.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
there
would
be
nothing
out
there
for
them
to
accept,
is
correct.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
well,
of
course,
the
board
is
apparently
adopting
this
bright
line
theory
that
it's
a
lot
easier
to
administer
the
act
if
we
have
a
specific
date,
and
obviously,
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
that
concept,
but
what
i'm
just
saying
is
the
specific
date
that
they
have
picked,
the
bright
line
rule
in
this
case,
there
is
no
logical
basis
for
it.
the
logical
basis
apparently
is
that
sending
a
sunday
evening
telegram
somehow
transforms
a
union
that
the
employer
had
every
reason
to
then
believe
had
a
good
faith
doubt
as
to
its
majority
status,
somehow
this
telegram,
sunday
evening
telegram,
transforms
that
apparently
minority
union
into
a
majority
union.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
created--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--created
by--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--yes.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
if--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--and
that's--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--and
that's
their
bright
line
theory.
i
think
the
illogical
argument
comes
into
play
this
way,
justice
breyer.
we
have
an
obligation,
as
an
employer
dealing
with
any
union,
at
all
times
to
see
to
it
to
investigate,
to
analyze
what
is
the
status
of
this
union?
is
it
a
majority
union,
or
is
it
a
minority
union?
obviously,
if
it's
a
minority
union,
does
not
represent
a
majority
of
employees,
it's
illegal
under
the
statute
for
us
to--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
at
least
beyond
the...
this
is...
the
certification
in
this
case,
and
of
course,
none
of
the
employees
who
were
involved
in
that
certification
process
are
still
employed
by
the
company,
but
the
certification
in
that
case
was
in
the
1970's,
as
i
recall,
so
you
have...
you
could
deal
with...
the
board
principle
is
that
once
it's
certified
there
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption
no
matter
what
happens
to
the
majority
status
for
a
1-year
period.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
so
even
though
you
know,
as
a
matter
of
moral
certainty,
that
the
union
has
lost
its
majority
status
during
that
year,
not
only
is
it
not
illegal
to
deal
with
them,
you
have
to
deal
with
them.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
we
suggest,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
employer
should
have
an
opportunity,
when
it
is
going
across
a
crescende
of
events
that
happened
in
this
case
during
this
3-day
period,
should
have
an
opportunity
to
analyze,
review
those
events,
to
see
whether
in
fact
it
is
dealing
with
a
majority
or
a
minority
union,
and
in
this
case
we
suggest
that
it
didn't
have.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
in
view
of
the
board's
decision
in
this
case,
your
honor--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--i
would...
i
certainly
wish
i
had
done
it--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--and
now
the
world
knows
that
that's
probably
the
best
way
to
do
it,
but
unfortunately
that
does
not
advance
productive
negotiations,
where
any
time
you
have
a
question
in
your
own
mind--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--absolutely.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
well,
i'll
just
take
two
of
the
major
events,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
that
led
to
the
employees
eventually
creating
in
its
own
mind
the
good
faith
doubt.
seven
union
supporters,
including
the
union
steward,
the
employer
received
that
information
on
friday
afternoon,
that
hearsay
information
that
these
seven
are
employed
elsewhere,
and
aren't
coming
back.
now,
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
review
that.
have...
was
that
decision
made
out
of
anger?
are
they
going
to
be
back
next
wednesday,
maybe,
the
next
week?
they
should
have
some
time
to
look
into
that.
the
other
information
was
that--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
as
long
as
we
move
quicker
than
they
do.
if--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--if...
we
would
have
been
protected
only
if
we
had
withdrawn
the
offer
or
withdrawn
recognition.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
our
position
is,
we
would
be...
if
at
the
time
of
that
telegram,
and
we
had
the
opportunity
to
conduct
this
investigation,
even
though
we
had
not
won
that
race
to
the
telegraph
office,
we
would
be
protected,
and
that's
our
position
in
this
case,
justice
stevens,
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
send
a
telegram
before
we
have
an
opportunity
to
fire
off
our
withdrawal...
and
i'd
ask
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
was
thanksgiving
week,
it
was
a
3-day
week,
and
sunday
of
week...
we
couldn't
fire
it
back,
obviously,
that
evening.
who
are
we
going
to
send--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--we
know
the
board
is
not
taking
a
position
on
that,
justice
scalia.
they
have
expressly
reserved--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--on
that
issue,
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
said--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--they
did
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
there
was
no
evidence
submitted--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--that
is
correct.
in
fact,
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
submitted
by
the
general
counsel
to--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--to
attempt
to
support
that
there
was
no...
that
there
was
a
majority
status.
our
evidence
was
that
we
had--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--yes,
and
we
explained
that.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
no.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
no,
there
was
no
finding.
the
administrative
law
judge
as
well
as
the
board
said,
it's
immaterial,
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that
because
at
the
time
the
company
had
an
acceptance,
therefore
the
rest
of
the
evidence
that
was...
and
this
was
a
3-day
hearing,
most
of
which
dealt
with
our
evidence
that
we
had
the
basis
for
a
good
faith
doubt,
but
the
administrative
law
judge
and
the
board
said
all
of
that
is
immaterial
because
there
was
an
offer-acceptance
and
sunday
evening
you
had
a
contract,
so
it's
too
late
to--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--the
board
in
its
petition,
in
its
brief
to
this
court
has
expressly
reserved
and
said
that
that
might
be
a
different
consideration
but
we're
not
going
to
get
into
that,
because
we
feel
a
good
faith
doubt
case,
which
they
claim
this
is,
is
different
from
a
actual
loss
of
majority
case,
so
they
are
hypothesizing
saying
it
might
be
different,
but
they
are
not
expressly
taking
that
position.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
i
think
it's
excellent
law,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
we
would
suggest
it
is
not,
and
i
would
remind
the
court,
as
i
am
sure
we
do
not
have
to,
that
in
that
case
there
was
an
unknowing
violation.
the
employer
was
under
the
false
impression
at
the
time
of
entering
the
agreement
it
felt
the
union
in
fact
was
a
majority
union.
when
it
was
established
that...
after
the
fact
that
it
was
not,
the
court
said,
that
contract
that
you
thought
was
a
contract
with
a
majority
union
is
illegal.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
that's
correct,
and
the
ironic
aspect
of
this
case
is,
i
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
the
logic
of
the
ilg
which
says
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
even
unknowingly
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
a
minority
union,
but
the--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--there
is
a
possible,
or
a
definite
argument,
certainly
during
the
1
year
after
the
certification,
that
there
was
a
legitimate
recognition,
but
the
certification
in
this
case
goes
back
at
least
a
generation,
so
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
certified--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
that's...
that's--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
it's...
has--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--but
a
contract
bar
rule
would
never
be
based
upon
an
agreement
that
in
turn
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
when
an
employer
enters
into
an
agreement
with
a
union
not
maintaining
majority
status,
that
contract
would
not
legitimately
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
contract
bar,
so
we're
saying
that
if
you
adopt
a
contract
bar
rule
by
analogy
in
this
case,
we
are
saying
that
when
that
telegram
was
fired
off,
the
union
more
than
likely
knew,
and
we
definitely
knew,
that
they
didn't
maintain
a
majority
status.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
i
think
you
have
to
focus
on
when
was
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
serves
as
the
basis
for
the...
what
was
the
basis
of
the
offer
and
acceptance?
what
was
the
status
of
the
parties
as
of
that
offer
and
acceptance
that
created
that
contract?
we're
saying
in
this
case
if
the
status
of
the
union
as
of
the
date
of
that
purported
acceptance
was
that
the
union
did
not
maintain
a
majority
status,
there
cannot
be
a
contract,
and
the
implications
of
a
legitimate
contract
do
not
flow.
a
legitimate
contract,
of
course,
creates
for
the...
if
it's
a
3-year
or
less
contract,
for
the
balance
of
that
collective
bargaining
there
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
the
union,
notwithstanding
its
actual
status
over
the
3
years,
there
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
it
is
maintaining
its
majority
status
so
as
to
encourage
the
parties
to
deal
with
each
other.
we
do
not
have
that
premise,
namely
a
legitimate
majority
status,
at
the
time
of
the
inception
of
this,
or
conception,
i
guess,
of
this
agreement.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
i
have
not
encountered
that
type
of
situation,
but
this
decision,
if
it
is
upheld,
might
encourage
the
type
of
appendage
to
an
offer.
again--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--i
think
the
labor
board
might
have
a
problem
with
that.
it's
one
thing
to
append
something
such
as
this
contract
is
only
valid
for
x
days,
or
sundown
tonight
the
offer
is
withdrawn,
but
to
put
something
like
that
onto
it
might
cause
some
problems
at
the
labor
board.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
i
think
the
deference
that
this
court
traditionally
gives
to
labor
board
decisions
is
not
applicable
here.
you
always...
the
court
has
always
conditioned
it,
we
will
defer
to
the
board
as
long
as
the
board's
ruling
is
rational
and
consistent
with
the
act.
our
position,
of
course,
is,
here
it's
not
rational
because
it's--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--the...
well,
not
in
the
presence
of
some
people
in
this
court
that
we
are
going
to
call
the
first
circuit
irrational,
but
they--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--they
did
determine,
without
saying
why,
really...
of
course,
they
sent
it
back,
you
will
recall,
in
the
first
instance
saying
that
the
board's
decision
really
didn't
say
anything,
that
cited
a
few
cases
having
nothing
to
do
with
this
factual
situation,
and
then
after
the
board
finally...
and
the
court
did
create
a
rather
impossible
task
for
the
board.
it
said,
all
right,
take
this
irrational
result
and
give
us
a
rational
basis
for
it,
and
i
don't
blame
the
board
for
taking...
and
even
though
the
court
said
do
this
expeditiously,
i
don't
blame
the
board
for
taking
2-1/2
years
to
come
up
with
an
attempt
to
rationalize
what
i
think
is
an
irrational
result.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
we
had
a
3-day
hearing
before
the
administrative
law
judge.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
no.
their
finding
was
that
all
of
the
evidence
we
presented...
this
is
both
the
administrative
law
judge
as
well
as
the
board
itself.
all
of
the
evidence
we
had
presented
over
this
3-day
period
was
immaterial
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
contract
and
therefore...
we
could
have
all
of
the
evidence,
people
swearing
on
bibles
that
they
didn't
want
this
union
there,
that's
immaterial
because
there
was
a
contract.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
well,
my
position,
of
course,
it
is
in
this
case,
notwithstanding
perhaps
inartful
phrasing
of
mine
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
in
the
two
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
if
i
may,
on
page
3a,
this
is
the
second
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
appendix
3a,
where
the
court
described
the
scenario
as
follows.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
3a
of
the--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--no,
of
the...
i'm
sorry,
yes,
of
the
petition.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
board
thus
refused
to
allow
the
company
to
present
evidence--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--yes.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief...
the
board
thus
refused
to
allow
the
company
to
present
evidence
that
the
union
in
fact
lacked
majority
support
at
the
time
it
accepted
the
company's
outstanding
offer.
almost
identical
comments
are
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
earlier
decision--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--yes.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
it
was...
we
used
the
same
evidence
to--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--i
would
have
to
ask
leave
of
the
court
to
stray
from
the
record.
i
had...
in
view
of
the...
when
i
saw
in
the
respondent's
brief
the
question
being
raised
that
we
had
not
raised
this
below,
i
pointed
out
to
brother
counsel
there
were
seven
separate
provisions
in
our
brief
to
the
administrative
law
judge,
same
separate
seven
provisions
in
our
brief
to
the
board--
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
--no,
in
the
pleading,
your
honor,
our
response
said
only
we
had
a
good
faith
doubt.
this
was
filed
at
the
time
of
the
original
complaint,
but
in
our
briefs
to
the
board,
in
our
briefs
to
the
first
circuit,
as
well
as
the
first
circuit's
opinion,
they
refer
to
the
loss
of
majority
status.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
in
our
briefs,
your
honor,
but
not
in
our
answer,
expressly.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
the
board's
position
was
that
the
evidence,
whether
it
purported
to
go
to
a
good
faith
doubt
or
to
a
lack
of
majority
status
was
immaterial
in
view
of
the
contract
having
been
formed.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
d.
o'reilly,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
the
manner
in
which
the
first
circuit
dealt
with
this
case,
and
it
dealt
with
it
on
the
basis
of
being
a
loss
of
majority
case.
if
i
may
just
briefly,
in
addition
to
the
reference
at
page
3a,
the
court
makes
identical
references
on
pages
80a,
82a,
and
in
the
specific
order
of
remand
to
the
board
at
page
83a
it
continuously
refers
to
the
issue
as
being
a
loss
of
majority,
and
it
is
easy
to
somehow
distinguish,
or
sometimes
confuse
the
distinguishing
factors.
in
fact,
in
this
case
there
is
a
reference
to
the
chicago
tribune,
the
seventh
circuit
case.
that
was
a
clear
loss
of
majority
case.
in
the
board's
brief
before
this
court
it
says
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
that,
that
was
a
loss
of
majority
case,
and
this
is
a
good
faith
doubt
case.
yet
if...
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
board's
own
decision
in
this
auciello
case.
how
does
it
refer
to...
on
seven
different
pages
of
the
board's
decision
in
this
case,
it
refers
to
the
chicago
tribune
case
as
being
a
good
faith
doubt.
it
continuously
says
the
employer
raised
its
good
faith
doubt.
so
sometimes
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
not
as
clear
as
we
would
like
it
to
be,
so
i
think
we
have
adequately
raised
the
actual
loss
of
majority
in
this
case.
notwithstanding
the
fact
it
was
not
expressly
raised
in
the
answer
to
the
board,
it
was
raised
a
number
of
times
in
the
briefs,
and
that's
how
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
it.
it
remanded
it
to
the
board
to
deal
with
an
actual
loss
of
majority
scenario,
and
the
board
can't
pick
and
choose,
i
would
submit.
while...
even
though
the
first
circuit
told
us
to
do
it,
number
1,
quickly,
we
are
not
going
to
do
that.
it
had
told
us
to
deal
with
the
actual
loss
of
majority
case.
it
can't
dictate
that.
that's
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
think
the
issue
is
a
live
one
before
this
court.
certainly...
thank
you.
