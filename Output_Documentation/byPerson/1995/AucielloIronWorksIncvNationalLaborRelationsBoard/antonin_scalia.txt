justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
the
board
rule,
that
even
if
you
were
to
show
unquestionably,
never
mind
good
faith
doubt,
that
the
union
no
longer
had
majority
status,
that
the
same
result
would
ensue?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
asking
you
what
the
board
rule
is.
is
the
board
rule
that
neither
the
establishment
of
a
good
faith
doubt,
nor
even
the
establishment
of
actual
nonmajority
status
will
suffice
to
get
you
out
of
the
contract
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
a
separate
question,
then,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
may
be
talking
about
something
that
really
doesn't
matter
anymore.
i
mean,
if
they
deep-six
the
whole
good
faith
doubt
rule,
it
doesn't
matter.
you
would
have
to
have
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
it
matters
to
your
client.
i
don't
want
to
say
it
doesn't
matter
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right,
even
though
it's
been
certified?
can
you
be
subjected
to
liability
for
dealing
with
a
properly
certified
union?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
1
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure--
--we
don't
know,
mr.
o'reilly,
do
we,
whether
the
board
takes
the
position
that
if,
in
fact,
there
was
not
majority
support
at
the
time
that
you
tried
to
withdraw
your
offer
the
contract
bar
rule
would
apply.
we
don't...
do
we
know
the
board's
position
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
has
to
be,
we
really
don't
know,
the
board's
going
to
tell
us
some
day.
but
in
this
case,
just
so
i
have
it
clear
in
my
own
mind,
did
they
make
a
factual
determination
one
way
or
another
as
to
whether
there
really
was
a
majority
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
did
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
finding
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
by
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
board
give
you
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
in
fact
there
was
no
majority
status?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
did
they
make
a
finding
that
you
couldn't...
that
you
hadn't
proved
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
how
it
can
possibly
be
said
that
the
question
of
whether
actual
nonmajority
status
would
suffice
to
avoid
the
contract
bar
rule
is
not
in
this
case.
how
could
it
possibly
be
said
that
it's
not
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
should
think
about
rulemaking
down
there
at
the
nl--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
think
about
it
from
time
to
time,
are
you
saying?
[laughter]
