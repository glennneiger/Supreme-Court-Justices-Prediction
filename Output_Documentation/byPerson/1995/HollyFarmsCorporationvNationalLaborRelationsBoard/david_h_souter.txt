justice
david
h.
souter
--or
they
can
be
acting
incidentally
to
holly's
slaughtering
operations.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
that
is
a
logical
possibility
here,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
i'm
just
talking
about
the...
i
thought
you
were
talking
about--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
drivers.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
that
same
possibility
open
to
the
chicken
catchers?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
question
about
that,
but
this...
doesn't
this
go
to
the
point
of
incidental
to
such
farming?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
mean,
there
is
at
least
a
reasonable
position,
isn't
there,
to
the
effect
that
if
the
chicken
catcher
is
hired
by
a
slaughterer
as
opposed
to
being
hired
by
the
farmer,
the
one
who
literally
owns
the
henhouse
with
the
chickens
in
it,
that
that
would
be
a
reason
for
saying
it
is
not
incidental
to
such
farming,
it
is
incidental
to
slaughtering?
i
mean,
that's
a
possible
position,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
at
the
precise
mathematical
moment
in
question
the
chickens
are
owned
by
somebody
who
is
neither
a
farmer
nor
a
nonfarmer.
the
chickens
are
owned
by
the
slaughterer
at
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
slaughterers
can
own
chickens.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
can't
they,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
that
leaves...
that
certainly
leaves
open
the
possibility,
and
i
suppose
the
certainty,
that
if
the
farmer
hired
an
independent
chicken
catcher,
like
the
thresher
of
the
wheat
in
the
example
from
the
1930's,
that
that
person
would
be
an
agricultural
worker
so
long
as
the
work
was
done
on
the
farm.
but
when
you've
got
the
condition
that
refers
to...
is
it
such
farm,
or
such
farming?
i
forget
which...
such
farming
operations,
then
you
have
yet
another
possibility
in
play,
and
that
is
the
possibility
that
when
the
person
who
hires
and
sends
the
chicken
catcher
is
neither
the
farmer,
nor
an
independent,
but
a
slaughterer,
and
the
work
is
being
done
as
a
preparation
for
the
slaughterer's
slaughtering,
that
in
fact
the
incidental
character
goes
to
slaughtering
and
not
to
farming.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was
added
to
exempt
the
independent
thresher,
and
people
in
the
thresher's
position,
but
these
chicken
catchers
are
not
like
the
independent
threshers
who
were
referred
to
in
the
senate
back
in
the
thirties.
they
are,
in
fact,
owned
by
yet
a
third
entity,
that
is
to
say,
the
slaughterer.
if
the
threshers,
for
example,
in
the
1930's
examples
had
been
employees
of,
what,
the
grain
wholesalers
or
silo
owners,
they
would
have
been
in
the
same
position,
i
suppose,
as
the
chicken
catchers
who
are
employed
by
the
slaughterers.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
point
is,
the
statute
can
be
read
in
a
way
that
does
not
have
that
effect
and
still
lead
to
the
board's
conclusion
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
is
that
material?
i
can
own
a
chicken,
and
i'm
not
a
farmer.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
can
raise
some
chickens
and
then
rent
them
out
to
someone
else,
and
at
that
point
i'm
saying,
the
farming's
over
for
me,
but
i
still
own
the
chickens,
so
i
don't
see
the
materiality
for
the
classification
of
the
fact
that
i
have
title.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
shows
it's
a
chicken
owner.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
used
to
be,
and
it's
finished.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
going
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
that
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
the
case
in
which
you
consider
all
the
factors
and
you're
on
the
fence,
and
you
say,
in
this
particular
case
there
are
good
reasons
to
say
it's
incidental
to
such
farming,
and
there
are
good
reasons
to
say
that
it's
incidental
to
slaughtering.
do
you
have
a
tie-breaker?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
no,
i
was
assuming
that
was
one
of
the
good
reasons.
i
mean,
that
is
a
reason
under
the
regs.
why
don't
you
say
in
the
case...
and
i'm
going
to
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
this
is
such
a
case.
you
could
say
that
it's
incidental
to
such
farming,
and
you
could
say
that
it's
incidental
to
slaughtering.
maybe
one
argument
is
stronger
than
the
other,
but
maybe
not,
but
there
are
arguments
each
way.
why
don't
we
simply
say,
the
presumption
of
the
statute
is
that
you're
an
employee
unless
it
is
demonstrated
that
you're
not,
and
therefore
the
tie-breaker
is
the
inclusiveness
of
the
general
definition
of
employee,
like
the
inclusiveness
of
the
general
definition
of
income.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
same
reg
that
justice
breyer
just
referred
to,
or
is
that
somewhere
else?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
in
the
brief.
i
thought
it
was
in
your
brief.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
seamon,
we
assume
they're
not
going
to
show
up
at
the
farm
and
have
the
farmer
just
stand
mute.
the
farmer
is
going
to
say,
yes,
go
into
that
chicken
house,
get
those
chickens.
watch
out
for
the
red
one.
yes.
[laughter]
why...
it
seems
to
me
that
this
brings
us
back
to
a
question
that
justice
scalia
has
posed
a
couple
of
times.
going
to
the
reg
on
page
27,
here
are
good
reasons
to
say,
in
the
abstract,
or
just
looking
to
common
language
usage,
that
the
chicken
catcher
in
this
case
is
doing
it
for
the
farmer,
and
there
are
good
reasons
to
say
that
he's
doing
it
for
the
processor,
but
what
we've
got
is
a
regulation
here
that
says,
if
you
want
to
know
how
to
make
the
choice
between
those
two
possibilities,
one
of
the
things
you
look
at
is
who
holds
title
to
the
chicken.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why
don't
you...
i
mean,
why...
don't
you
have
a
fair
argument
saying,
look,
we've
got
to
have
tie-breakers
somewhere,
somebody's
got
to
figure
out
what
they
are,
and
this
department
of
labor
regulation
has
said,
let's
look
to
title,
and
therefore
defer
to
the
regulation,
admitting
that
as
a
matter
of
language
it
could
go
either
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we
ought
to
defer
to
it.
and
you
always
assume
that
the
tie
has
to
be
broken.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
acknowledgement
that
independent
contractor's
employees
when
they
engage
in
this
business
are
engaging
in
agriculture.
it
seems
to
me
that
acknowledgement
admits
that
you
don't
have
to
be
incidental
to
one
or
the
other,
you
can
be
incidental
to
both.
surely
those
people,
when
they
do
that
work,
are
doing
it
incidentally
to
the
independent
contractor's
business
of
catching
and
cooping
chickens.
there's
no
doubt
that
it's
incidental
to
his
business,
and
there's
also
no
doubt
that
it
is
incidental
to
the
farmer's
business.
you
acknowledge
that.
the
government
acknowledges
it.
so,
you
know,
just
taking
that
one
example,
it's
clear
that
you
can
be
incidental
to
both,
so
all
of
your
pains
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
incidental
to
the
processing
business
lead
you
nowhere.
one
can
say
yes,
i
admit
it's
incidental
to
processing,
but
it's
also
incidental
to
farming.
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
relevant
in
respect
to
that,
if
it's
all
right...
i
mean--
--yes.
that
the...
nobody...
is
there
some
authority
that...
i
mean,
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
let
employees
organize,
and
you
don't
want
to
let
them
organize
where
they
just
work
for
farmers
because
the
farmers
didn't
have
the...
they
were
poorer.
they
were
poorer,
and
that's
why
they
didn't
have
to
pay
the
labor
act
wages
either,
or
the
flsa
wages.
they
were
poorer,
and
when
somebody
works
for
a
big
company,
they're
not
under
any
assumption
they're
poorer.
i
mean,
that
would
be
a...
does
that
come
into
play
anywhere
in
this...
i
mean,
is
there
some
authority
that
says
we
can't
take
into
account
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
