how
about
the
truck
driver?
that
doesn't
sound
particularly
agricultural
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
can
we
see
them...
can
we
solve
this
case
by
just
thinking
of
chicken
catchers
without
knowing
the
employer
involved?
now,
suppose
holly
farms
didn't
ever
hatch
any
chickens.
it
was
only
in
the
slaughtering
and
processing
business.
so
it
goes
to
the
farms,
it
sends
its
trucks
and
teams
to
the
farms,
they
pick
up
the
chickens,
they
haul
them
to
the
slaughterhouse
or
the
processing
plant,
and
they
don't...
they're
not
even
in
the
farming
business
at
all.
they
just
pick
up
the
chicks
for
slaughter
and
processing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
one
could
accept
that
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute,
but
isn't
there
some
respect
that
we
owe
to
the
contrary
interpretation
of
the
nlrb
and
its
ruling
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
roberts,
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
my
question
in
the
very
beginning
you're
saying
this
business
about
whether
holly
is
the
farmer
is
only
relevant
to
whether
you
can
catch
the
live
haul
driver,
because
under
any
scenario,
as
you
see
this
case,
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
person
have
to
be
agricultural
laborers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
seamon,
are
you
saying
that
even
if
holly
farms
never
has
this
contracting-out
operation,
so
they
did
everything
from
hatching
the
chicks
to
raising
them
to
bringing
them
to
slaughter,
even
so,
these
employees
would
be
typed
by
the
board
nonagricultural
employees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
they
are
teams,
and
that's
what
they
do.
they
catch
chickens,
and
they
bring
them
to
the
slaughterhouse,
but
they
are
operating
under
the
aegis
of
one
integrated
operation
that
does
everything
and
farm's
nothing
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
case
about
union
representation
for
teams
that
catch
chickens
for
slaughter.
the
question
all
these
workers
properly
place
in
the
union
representation
unit
covering
processing
plant’s
employees
as
the
national
labor
relations
board
held
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed,
or
should
they
be
ranked
agriculture
labors
exempt
from
national
labor
relations
act's
coverage
as
holly
farms,
their
employer
and
the
petitioners
here
maintained.
in
resolving
this
issue
which
has
divided
that
all
courts
of
appeals,
we
accord
respect
to
the
reasoning
in
judgment
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
because
it
is
the
agency
entrusted
with
responsibility
for
administering
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
not
too
much
detail
despite
the
inescapable
fascination
of
chicken
catching
as
a
subject
for
judicial
review,
dissenting
with
wilkesboro,
north
carolina,
the
processing
plant
of
holly
farms,
a
company
that
produces,
processes,
and
markets
poultry.
a
local
of
the
team
state
union
sought
to
become
the
bargaining
representative
of
employees
at
the
wilkesboro
plant
including
certain
workers
called
live-haul
crews
teams
of
truck
drivers,
forklift
operators,
and
chicken
catchers,
dispatched
to
farm
where
newly
hatched
chicks
are
raised,
a
live-haul
crew
cathes
chickens
grown
to
a
size
fit
for
broiling
loads
them
onto
truck
and
holds
the
birds
to
the
wilkesboro
plant
to
be
slaughtered
and
prepared
for
retail
sale.
holly
farms
hatches
and
owns
the
chicks
but
does
not
raise
them,
that
job
is
done
on
farms
owned
by
independent
growers
under
contract
to
holly.
an
agricultural
labor
under
the
governing
statutory
definition
works
on
a
farm
as
an
incident
to
or
in
conjunction
with
the
farm's
farming
operations.
while
the
live-haul
truck
drivers
do
not
do
their
part
of
the
crew
on
the
farm,
the
chicken
catchers
and
forklift
operators
unquestionably
do
catch,
cage,
and
load
the
chicken
on
the
independent
grower’s
farms.
the
board
determined
however
that
the
team’s
work
is
not
incident
to
or
in
conjunction
with
the
raising
of
chickens
by
the
independent
farmers
instead,
as
seen
by
the
board,
the
live-haul
work
is
conjunction
with
the
slaughtering
and
market
preparation
operations
at
holly
farm's
processing
plant.
this
is
the
question
we
conclude
on
which
reasonable
minds
can
and
do
different.
the
board’s
current
decision
adheres
to
consistent
mind
of
board
decision
because
we
find
the
statutory
language
not
free
from
ambiguity.
we
differ
to
the
board’s
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
language
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
whose
judgment
we
affirm.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
as
to
the
truck
drivers
and
dissenting
with
respect
to
the
forklift
operators
and
chicken
catchers.
her
opinion
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas.
