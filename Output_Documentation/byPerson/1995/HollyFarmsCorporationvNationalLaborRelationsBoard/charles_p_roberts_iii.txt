mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
during
the
200-plus
years
of
our
country's
history,
agriculture
has
undoubtedly
changed
dramatically.
over
the
years,
it
has
become
more
mechanized,
more
specialized,
and
a
much
larger
business.
yet,
as
i
stand
here
today
in
1996
before
this
court,
the
process
of
catching
chickens
remains
one
of
the
most
rudimentary
agricultural
processes
that
one
can
visualize.
workers
using
nothing
but
their
two
hands
manually
catch
chickens
and
place
them
into
cages
in
order
that
these
chickens
can
be
delivered
to
market.
one
would
not
think
that
it
would
take
much
analysis
to
conclude
that
these
workers
are
agricultural
laborers,
yet
the
parties,
including
us,
spend
pages
and
pages
of
our
briefs
discussing
whether
holly
farms
is
a
farmer
when
it
sends
its
chicken...
sends
its
live
haul
crews
to
the
farms
of
the
independent
growers.
we
spend
pages
discussing
whether
catching
chickens
is...
or
whether
chickens
can
be
harvested.
we
spend
pages
discussing
whether
the
live
haul
crews
are
acting
in
some
way
in
a
relationship
with
the
processing
plant,
perhaps
proving
that
lawyers
and
sometimes
judges
can
make
issues
that
are
quite
simple
seem
complex.
fortunately,
i
don't
have
to
rely
on
common
sense
here
today,
because
we
have
a
statute
that
congress
carefully
considered
that
specifically
defines
with
some
precision
what
is
agriculture.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
no,
your
honor.
i
think
in
this
case
we
see
that
common
sense
does
equate
with
what
congress
has
done.
i
just
wouldn't
want
to
be
making
only
a
common
sense
argument.
however,
what
we
have
is
a
statute...
and
if
nothing
else
from
my
argument
becomes
clear
today,
i
hope
it
will
be
clear
that
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators
are
at
a
minimum
engaged
in
secondary
agriculture
within
the
meaning
of
section
3(f).
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
well,
i
think
the
truck
drivers
are
a
much
more
difficult
question.
i
think
that
the
issue
there
turns
on
whether
holly
is
a
farmer,
because
their
activities
do
not
take
place
on
a
farm.
i
think
logically
it
makes
more
sense
to
address
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators
first,
because
the
issue
in
our
opinion
is
much
clearer
on
those,
and
if
we
prevail
on
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators
then,
even
if
we
lose
on
the
live
haul
drivers,
that
undermines
the
board's
bargaining
unit.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
and
if
those
were
the
facts,
the
chicken
catchers
and
forklift
operators
would
still
be
agricultural
laborers,
but
the
live
haul
drivers
would
not
be
agricultural
laborers
in
our
opinion,
under
the
facts
that
you
have
posed.
how
do
we
know
that?
we
can
look
at
the
statute
itself,
which
is
found
at
page
3
of
the
blue
brief.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
think--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--that's
our
position,
is
that
at
a
minimum,
while
we
contend--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
bayside
dealt
with
feed
haul
drivers,
and
there
was
no
contention
in
that
case
that
their
work
was
performed
on
a
farm,
so
the
sole
issue
was
whether
bayside
was
a
farmer,
which
also
applies
to
our...
we
concede
that
that
applies
to
our
live
haul
drivers,
but
not
to
the
chicken
catchers.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
we
believe
that
that's
the
correct
analysis,
your
honor,
but
if
we
take
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators
and
we
look
at
the
statute,
which
is
on
page
3
of
the
blue
brief,
it
says
agriculture
includes,
among
other
things,
the
raising
of
poultry,
and
any
practices
performed
by
a
farmer
or
on
a
farm
as
an
incident
to
or
in
conjunction
with
such
farming
operations,
including
preparation
for
market.
now,
we
know
that
the
chicken
catchers
and
forklift
operators
work
on
a
farm,
because
that
is
conceded.
we
also
know
that
catching,
caging,
and
loading
live
chickens
constitutes
preparation
for
market
because
the
board
really
does
not
dispute
that,
and
the
secretary
of
labor
has
specifically
defined
those
tasks
as
being
preparation
for
market.
we
also
know
that
the
activities
of
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators
are
incidental
to
farming
because
section
3(f)
specifically
states
that
preparation
for
market
is
an
activity
that
is,
per
se,
incidental
to
farming.
the
only
remaining
question
is,
is
it
related,
incidental
to
or
in
conjunction
with
such
farming,
and
we
know
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
because
the
chickens
that
are
caught,
caged,
and
loaded
onto
the
trucks
are
the
same
chickens
that
are
raised
on
the
farms
on
which
the
truck
drivers
work,
so
under
the
plain
language
of
section
3(f),
it
is
clear
that
the
chicken
catchers
and
forklift
operators
at
a
minimum
meet
the
secondary
definition
of
agriculture.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
we
don't
believe
that
in
this
case
the
board's
opinion
is
entitled
to
any
deference
on
the
chicken
catchers
and
forklift
operators,
because
the
issue
in
our
view
is
that
that's
the
only
reasonable
interpretation
of
section
3(f).
we
also
contend
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
phrases
such
as
incidental
to
farming
operations
is
contrary
to
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
maneja
and
farmers
reservoir,
so
we
think
that
there's
a
principle
of
stare
decisis
that
applies
here,
too.
we
also
take
the
position
that
their
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
secretary
of
labor's,
so
for
a
variety
of
reasons
we
think
that
the
board's
interpretation
in
this
case
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
not
reasonable.
i'm
referring
right
now
to
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators.
i
must
emphasize
that
analytically
they
are
separate
from
the
live
haul
drivers,
and
that
the
two
groups
do
not
necessarily
rise
or
fall
together.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
we
don't--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--our
position
on
the
live
haul
drivers
is
that
the
statute
is
not
specifically
ambiguous
but
it
does
require
interpretation
and,
had
the
board
made
a
choice
in
this
case
between
holly
and
the
independent
grower,
that
choice
might
have
been
entitled
to
reference...
i
mean,
to
deference.
but
what's
happened
in
this
case
is,
unlike
bayside,
where
the
board
took
the
position
that
the
independent
grower
was
the
relevant
farmer,
the
board
denies
in
this
case
that
the
independent
grower
is
the
farmer.
it
takes
the...
and
it
also
denies
that
holly
farms
is
the
farmer,
so
what
we
have
is
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
these
chickens,
which
are
still
on
the
farm,
have
no
farmer,
and
that's
the
basis
for
our
argument,
is
that--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--well,
we
think
that
their--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--not
necessarily,
because
holly,
even
with
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators,
they
can
be
covered
in
one
of
two
ways.
they
can
be
acting
incidentally
to
the
farming
operations
of
the
farm,
or
they
can
be
acting
incidentally
to
holly's
farming
operations.
it's
our
position
that
they're
doing
both.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
that
is
the
position
that
the
board
takes,
and
we
think
that--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--not...
the
chicken
catchers,
we
think
that
that's
not
a
logical--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--the
drivers?
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
we
think
that
that
is
one
possibility
that,
you
know,
could
be
argued,
but
the
problem
is--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--because
the
statute,
your
honor,
specifically
defines
preparation
for
market
of
agricultural
commodities
raised
on
that
farm
as
being
incidental.
congress
specifically--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--it--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--we
don't
think
that
under
any
reasonable
interpretation,
because
what
that...
if
you
adopt
that
interpretation,
then
it
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
farmer
in
this
case,
that
it's
not
incidental
to
anyone's
farming
operation--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--but
if
they're--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--but
the
congress
is--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--certainly.
certainly,
and
we
would
agree
that
if
the
slaughterers
own
the
chickens
and
the
slaughterer
had
no
raising
hatcheries
or
anything
of
that
nature,
then
the
live
haul
drivers
would
be...
would
be...
would
not
be
covered,
but
what
we're
dealing
here
is
with
work
on
a
farm.
congress
specifically
added
the
"on
a
farm"
language
to
cover
people
who
were
not
farmers,
who
did
tasks
on
the
farm.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
we
don't
think
that
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation,
your
honor,
that
congress...
we
don't
think
that
was
congress'
intent.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
well,
because
the
language
specifically
was
added
to
exempt
somebody
who
was
not
a
farmer,
and
if
you
accept--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--well,
the
interpretation
that
you
pose
is
one
posed
in
the
board's
brief,
but
it
was
not
posed
by
the
board
in
its
decision,
and
it's
directly
contrary
to
the
board's
decision
in
produce
magic,
where
the
board
held
that
an
independent
harvester
who
went
from
farm
to
farm
providing
services
for
lettuce
growers
was
not
an
agricultural
laborer,
even
though
the
work
was
performed
on
a
farm,
because
he
wasn't
a
farmer.
so
the
board
has
read
the
statute
in
a
manner
which
prevents
anybody
other
than
a
farmer
from
ever
performing
secondary
activities.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
only
by
adopting
a
logic
that
is
specifically
contrary
to
what
the
board
has
held
in
another
case,
and
we
don't
think
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
method
for
doing
it.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
that's--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--the
board
has
effectively
imposed
a
solely
or
exclusively
requirement
into
section
3(f)
which
is
not
warranted
by
the
act.
if
you
look
at
the
court's
decision
in
the
sugar
cane
case
in
hawaii,
maneja,
where
they
specifically
dealt
with
railroad
workers
who
transported
sugar
cane
from
the
fields
to
the
processing
mill,
the
court
clearly
viewed
that
activity
as
being
incidental
to
farming
even
though
the
purpose
and
the
ultimate
destination
of
the
sugar
cane
was
the
employer's
processing
mill
where
the
sugar
cane
was
going
to
be
processed
into
sugar
and
molasses.
so
it
seems
clear
from
that
decision
that
the
question
of
whether
something
is
related
to
farming
is
not
a
question
of
whether
it
has
any
relationship
to
processing
but
how
is
it,
and
is
it
the
kind
of
activity
that
we
would
view
as
being
reasonably
related
to
the
farming
operation.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
well,
i
think
that
one
problem
with
the
board's
interpretation
is
it
leads
to
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
business
relationships
between
the
different
employers,
and
we
read
section
3(f)
as
focusing
primarily
on
the
nature
of
the
work,
and
under
the
board--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
breyer.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
the...
there's
two--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--well,
there's
two
problems
with
that.
it
may
be
incidental
to
farming--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--but...
but
it
still,
to
be
covered,
has
to
either
be
performed
on
a
farm--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--or
by
a
farmer.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
well,
i
mean,
obviously
that
is
a
question
that
i
think
the
court
would
have
to--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--well,
that
same
argument
would
apply
to
the
independent
wheat
thresher.
he's
acting
as
an
incident
to
his
own
business
operations,
yet
congress
clearly
intended--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--no.
no,
the
congress
specifically
took
the
position
that
the
independent
wheat
thresher
was
not
a
farmer.
he
was...
in
fact,
that
same
argument
was
advanced
that
he
was
nothing
more
than
a
huckster
who
went
from
farm
to
farm
selling
his
tinware,
and
that...
and
congress
took
the
position
that
even
though
he
was
an
independent
businessman,
because
his
activities
occurred
on
a
farm
and
were
related
incidentally
to
or
in
conjunction
with
farming,
they
were
covered.
so
the
argument
that
you
pose...
i
agree
the
water,
providing
the
water
is
a
more
difficult
question,
because
the
question
becomes
whether
it
has
any
relationship
whatsoever
to
agricultural...
you
know,
even
though
it's
an
activity,
it
may
not
be
incident...
the
issue
may
be
that
it
just
has
no
relationship,
really,
to
the
farming
operations
themselves.
in
this
case,
there's
no
question
that
the
activities
of
the
drivers
as
well
as
the
chicken
catchers
and
forklift
operators
are
secondary
activity.
the
board
is
not
contending
that
there's
something
about
the
activities
that
are
not
agricultural.
their
argument
focuses
on
the
relationship--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--your
honor,
it
covers
a
lot
of
farms,
but
what
happens
is,
the
live
haul
drivers
deliver
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators
to
the
farms.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
so
we
have
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators
perform
their
tasks.
once
the
truck--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--no.
it
may
involve
going
to
several
different
farms.
at
some
point
in
time--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--i
think
the...
from
one
farm
would
probably
be
less
than
what
they
get
in
one
load.
in
other
words,
the--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--no.
they
go
to
a
different
farm,
and
once
you've
cleaned
out
one
farm,
then,
you
know--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--they
have
to
go
to
other
farms,
your
honor.
there's
hundreds
of
farms--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--it
picks
up
all
the
available
chickens.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
yes,
and
then
it
goes
to
farm
b.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
it
goes
to
farm
b.
at
some
point
the
truck
becomes
full
and
the
live
haul
truck
driver
takes
the
truck
back
to
the
plant,
drops
the
trailer,
and
then
returns--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--to
a
farm.
the
chicken
catchers
and
forklift
operators
don't
go
back
with
the
live
haul
driver
while
he's
dropping
off
a
load
unless
it's
the
end
of
their...
you
know,
the
end
of
their
day.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
well,
obviously,
yes.
if
they
reach
a
farm,
and
then
the
truck
gets
loaded,
it
has
to
go
back,
and
then
at
some
point
either
that
truck
or
another
truck...
they
have
more
live
haul
drivers
than
they
do
crews,
so
there
can
be,
you
know,
several
drivers
out
there,
and
then
another
truck
would
have
to
come
in
order
to
complete
the
loading
process
at
that
particular
farm.
but
the
chicken...
my
point
is,
is
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
dri...
i
mean,
the
forklift
operators
stay
on
the
farms
until
the
end
of
their
shift
and
then
they
go
home.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
it
may
be
the
same,
or
it
may
be
a
different
truck.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
said,
the
live
haul
drivers
turn
on
whether
holly
is
a
farmer.
now,
the
board
concedes
that
holly
is
a
farmer
in
its
hatcheries
when
it
breeds
and
hatches
the
chicks.
it
takes
the
position,
however,
that
neither
the
grower
nor
holly
is
the
farmer
of
the
chickens
at
the
time
that
the
live
haul
crews
arrive
at
the
farm,
and
our
position
is,
is
that
the
board
might
have
been
able
to
choose
the
farmer
over
holly,
but
it
had
to
choose
one
of
them.
the
chickens
had
to
have
a
farmer.
they're
still
on
the
farm.
they
haven't
been
reduced
to
possession.
either
holly
or
the
grower
has
to
be
the
farmer.
now,
the
board
in
its
brief
specifically
rejects,
and
in
the
case
specifically
rejects
the
position
that
the
grower
is
the
farmer,
and
the
reasons
that
it
gives
establishes
that
holly
resumes
its
status.
thus,
the
reasons
that
the
board
tells
us
in
its
brief
why
the
grower
is
not
the
farmer
is
that
holly
bred
and
hatched--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--we're
saying
that
both
are.
we're
saying
that
you
can
be...
in
this
particular
case,
the
activities
of
all
these
workers
can
be
incidental
to
both
holly's
farming
operations
and
to
the
grower's
farm...
it's...
remember,
the
statute
speaks
of
the
farms.
the
operation,
the
farming
operations
that
take
place
on
the
farm,
those
operations
were
the
grower's
operations
in
raising
the
chickens.
well,
when
you
catch
chickens
that
have
been
raised
on
a
farm,
we
contend
that
by
definition,
that's
related
to
the
farm's
farming
activities.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
our
position,
though,
is,
is
that
in
addition
to
that,
holly
has
resumed
its
status
as
a
farmer
because
it
holds
title
to
the
chicks,
it
actually
performs
the
delivery,
or
the
catching,
the
caging
and
the
delivery,
and
as
the
board
points
out
in
its
brief,
the
grower
provides
a
service
for
holly.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
because
that--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
and
the
case
you
pose
would
be
one
where
the
entity
had
no
previous
farming
status
with
regard
to
those
chickens.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--that--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--well--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--that's
the
major
distinction,
but
we
think
it's
an
important
distinction.
the
other--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--well--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--there's
a
second
distinction,
your
honor,
is
that
holly
owns
the
chickens.
the
example
you
pose
would
be
one
where
the
chickens
were
not
owned
by
the
independent
contractor,
so
they
would
have
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
these
particular
chickens.
so
we
think
it
is
a
material
distinction
that
they
own
the
chickens,
that
the
grower...
you
see,
as
the
board
points
out--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--well,
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
but
the
title
to
the
chicken
runs
hand-in-hand
with
the
fact
that
we
bred
and
hatched
these
chickens.
i
don't
think
you
can
separate
the
two.
the
fact
remains
is
that
we
do
have
a
very
close
tie.
we
remain,
if
you
look
at--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--well,
i
think
the
title
of
it
bears
on
the
fact
that
it
shows
that
the
relationship
that
holly
has
to
the
chickens...
by
itself,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
that
would--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--but
it
also
has
to
show
that
in
conjunction
with
that
it
is
engaged
in
the
breeding
and
hatching
of
chicks.
it
then--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--and
it
performs...
and
another
argument
that
i've
not
really
had
time
to
address
is
that
the
activities
of
the
chicken
catchers
and
forklift
operators
are
actually
primary
agriculture,
and
they're
actually
harvesting
the
chickens
within
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
no,
i'm
not,
because
i
don't
have
a
lot
of
time.
[laughter]
but
to
answer
your
question--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--obviously,
that
is
our
position,
and
it's
our...
i
would
agree
it's
our
strongest
argument,
and
that's
why
i
keep
emphasizing
you
have
to
separate
the
two.
analytically
they
are
distinct,
and
if...
if
the
court
is
inclined
to
show
deference
to
the
board
on
the
live
haul
drivers,
we
would
strenuously
argue
that
such
deference
would
not
be
owed
on
the
chicken
catchers
because
of
the
nature
of
the
language
and
the
intent
of
congress.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
just
a
couple
of
quick
responses
on
some
of
these
regs
which
have
been
referred
to.
he's
ignored
several
that
i
think
have
to
be
interpreted
in
conjunction
with
the
ones
that
he
cited.
in
particular,
section
780.150(k)...
excuse
me,
151(k),
the
secretary
of
labor
defines
the
poultry,
hauling,
grading,
cooping
and
loading
poultry
are
operations
that
are
incidental
or
that
constitute
preparation
for
market.
also,
780.126,
which
is
cited
by
this
court
in
bayside,
specifically
says
that
the
activities
of
a
processor
when
performed
on
the
farm,
it
envisions
this
very
situation
we
have
here,
where
the
processor
has
title
and
is
dealing
with
an
independent
grower,
because
this
is
a
very
common
arrangement.
it
says
that
the
processor's
employees
can
be
engaged
in
secondary
agriculture
to
the
extent
that
they
are
working
on
a
farm.
so
if
that
statute,
if
that
regulation
has
any
meaning,
then
the
board's
position
that
it's
incidental,
i
mean,
the
processing
argument
could
be
made
there,
too.
it's
always
incidental
to
processing
in
some
way
if
it's
a
processor,
yet
this
regulation
clearly
envisions
that
a
processor's
employees
who
work
on
a
farm
can
be
engaged
in
secondary
agriculture.
plus
the
case--
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
--excuse
me?
it's
780.126,
plus
the
case
that's
cited
in
there
by
the
secretary
of
labor
is
johnston
v.
cotton
producers,
which
is
a
fifth
circuit
case,
but
it's
cited
with
approval,
and
in
that
case,
it
dealt
with
a
retail
store,
which...
the
reg
speaks
of
retail
stores
and
processors
in
the
same
language.
at
one
time
retail
stores
would
hold
title
to
the
chickens
and
then
basically
perform
services
for
the
farmer,
and
they
say
in
that
case
that,
specifically
that
chicken,
a
guy
who
caught
chickens
and
loaded
them
on
the
trucks
was
engaged
in
secondary
agriculture
to
the
extent
that
his
activities
occurred
on
the
farm,
so
the
board's
position
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
it
simply...
that
it's
going
to
holly's
processing
operation,
which
is
inconsistent
with
this
regulation,
it's
inconsistent
with
johnston,
it's
inconsistent
with
maneja,
in
which
the
destination
of
the
sugar
cane
was
the
processing
plant,
but
that
didn't
deter
the
court
from
saying
that
the
activities
were
incidental
to
farming.
so
the
board
has
just
gone
way
beyond
interpret...
you
know,
reasonable
interpretation
of
a
statute
in
saying
that
it
can
only
be
incidental
to
processing
in
light
of
all
these
prior
decisions
and
interpretations.
mr.
charles
p.
roberts,
iii
i
think
it's
to
actually...
they
don't
take
the
whole
beaks
off.
they
actually
trim
them
back,
and
i
think
the
purpose
is...
and
i
don't
know
this
for
certain,
but
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
prevent
them
from
harming
themselves
or
each
other
in
some
way,
that...
you
know,
with
the
beaks
pecking
each
other,
or
attacking
each
other,
or
something
of
that
nature.
i
don't
have
anything
further.
