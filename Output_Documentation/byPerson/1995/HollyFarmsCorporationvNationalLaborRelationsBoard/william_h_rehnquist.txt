chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-210,
holly
farms
corporation
v.
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suggesting
that
common
sense
and
congress'
statutes
are
mutually
exclusive?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
just
be
a
coincidence,
then,
that
if
at
some
point
you
didn't
have
to
go
back
to
the
same
farm,
because
what
you...
what
regulates
when
they
go
back
is
when
they've
got
a
full
truck,
not
when
they've
cleaned
out
one
farm.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
statute
use
the
term,
processing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they're
not
described
that
way
in
the
statute.
i
mean,
it
may
be
one
thing
that
led
to
this
particular
statutory
exemption,
but
it
may...
the
exemption
is
in
broader
terms
than
the
examples
which
might
have
led
to
it.
it's
the
statutory
language
that
governs
and
not
the
thought
that
might
have
been
behind
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
comes
from
a
couple
of
old
cases.
i
don't
think
we're
repeated
it
recently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
that
note,
the
case
is
submitted.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-210,
holly
farms
corporation
versus
national
labor
relations
board
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
