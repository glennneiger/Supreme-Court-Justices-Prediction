mr.
richard
h.
seamon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
workers
at
issue
here
go
from
petitioner's
processing
plants
to
the
farms
of
independent
growers
to
pick
up
mature
broiler
chickens
and
take
them
back
to
the
processing
plant
to
be
slaughtered
and
dressed.
petitioner's
own
witness
testified
that
this
work
is
the
first
step
of
the
processing
operation,
and
that
the
work
is
coordinated
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
processing
plant.
it
is
undisputed
that
chicken
processing
is
not
an
agricultural
activity.
the
question
is
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
reasonably
concluded
that
these
workers,
called
live
haul
workers,
are
not
within
the
agricultural
exemption
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
think--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
believe
that
the
work
of
the
chicken
catchers
and
forklift
operators
isn't
incidental
to
the
primary
farming
operations
that
go
on
on
the
farms
where
they
do
their
activity,
and
one
of
the
difficulties
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
they
avoid
the
statutory
term,
such.
that
word
requires
you
to
look
at
the
connection
between
the
activity
to
be
classified
and
what's
going
on
on
the
farm,
and
the
farm--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right,
and
that
process--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--absolutely.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--but
in
that
sense
of
the
term,
incidental,
the
processing
operation
itself
is
also
incidental
to
the
farm.
there
has
to
be
a
market
for
the
farmers
or
else,
you
know,
the
growing,
they're
grown
for
no
purpose.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no,
the
statute
does
not.
the
statute
raised...
basically
imposes
three
requirements,
and
we
think
one
of
them,
it
is
not
met
here
with
respect
to
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
forklift
operators.
first,
the
work
has
to
be
done
by
a
farmer
or
on
a
farm.
second,
it
has
to
be
done
incidentally
to
or
in
connection
with
primary
farming
operations,
and
the
third
and,
we
think,
the
most
important
requirement
that's
not
met
here
is
that
it
has
to
be
incidental
to
the
operations
that
go
on
on
that
farm.
the
operations
in
this
case
are
defined
by
the
contract
between
the
independent
growers
and
holly
farms.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
answer
to
that
i
believe
was
suggested
by
justice
breyer.
it
does
make
a
difference
who
you
work
for
as
to
whether
you
fall
within
the
agricultural
exemption
or
not.
congress
intended
the
agricultural
exemption
to
extend
to
farmers
but
not
to
processors.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
and
the
independent
contractor
example
came
up
as
a
result
of
concerns
on
the
part
of
some
senators
with
a
situation
that
fell
somewhere
between
farming
and
processing,
and
they
were
concerned
with
a
firm
that
carved
out
a
niche
for
itself
by
traveling
from
farm
to
farm
performing
a
service
on
the
farm
for
the
farmer
with
regard
to
his
or
her
commodities,
and
those
firms
were
described
as
doing
nothing
but
threshing
wheat,
or
some
other
similar
service.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct,
and
we...
but
we
believe
that
in
terms
of
determining
whether
an
activity
is
incidental
to
the
primary
farming
operations
that
are
going
on
on
a
farm,
it's
important
to
determine
whether
it's
connected
with
some
broader
process.
in
this
case,
the
chicken-catching
operations
are
connected
with
the
broader
process
of
slaughtering
and
dressing
the
chickens
for
market.
to
that
extent,
they're
no
longer
incidental.
you
can't
say
that
that's
true
in
the
case
of
an
independent
contractor
whose
work
is
limited
to
going
from
farm
to
farm
and
catching
chickens.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no,
we
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
not
a
necessary
premise
of
our
argument.
the
statute
really
asks
only
one
question,
and
that
is
whether
the
activity
is
incidental
to
the
primary
farming
operation,
and
that's
the
only
question
that
has
to
be
answered.
we're
saying
the
chicken
catching
and
the
forklift
operations
are
really
part
of
the
processing
operation,
and
we're
relying
on
a
number
of--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it's
only
incidental
in
the
same
sense
that
it's
necessary
for
the
farmer
to
find
someone
to
sell
the
farmer's...
the
chickens
to
once
they're
grown,
and
that's...
and
whatever
operations
the
purchaser
performs
on
those
chickens
are
part
of
the
process
that
if
there
were
no
market
for
the
chickens
they
wouldn't
be
grown
at
all
in
the
first
place,
so
in
that
sense,
processing
is--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
are
not
saying...
the
board
is
not
saying
that
chicken
catching
operations
can
never
be
incidental
to
primary
farming.
it's
highly
relevant
the
way
in
which
the
operations
are
performed
and
for
whose
benefit
they're
performed.
in
the
case
of
an
independent
contractor
hired
by
a
farmer,
then
the
chicken
catching
is
performed
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmer.
but
when
they're
performed
by
a
set
of
employees
who
are
dispatched
from
the
processing
plant
and
whose
work
is
really
scheduled
to
meet
its
needs,
that
work
no
longer
is
incidental
to--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes,
but
again
i
would
go
back
to
the
term
"such"
in
the
statute,
because
i
believe
that
word
is
key
here
in
the
sense
that
it
requires
you
to
focus
on
the
particular
farming
operations
that
we're
talking
about,
and
those
operations
are
defined
by
contract
as
being
limited
to
raising
the
chickens
to
a
certain
age
and
then
making
them
available
for
processing.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
answer
would
be
the
same
with
respect
to
both
phases
of
the
operation.
they...
those
workers
would
be
involved
in
processing
under
the
circumstances
of
this--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes,
that's
right,
and
again
for
the
same
reasons
that
exist
on
this
case.
they're
sent
out
of
the
processing
plant.
they
are
employees
of
the
processor.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
would
say
that
the
time
spent
on
both
farms,
on
both
kinds
of
farms
would
not
be
incidental
to
the
farming
operations
there,
if
the
facts
were
otherwise
the
same
as
they
are
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that
they
would
not
be
farm
workers
there,
and
again,
it
is
because
of
the
way
in
which
this
work
is
organized.
i
mean,
it's
no
accident
that
the
petitioner's
own
industry
has
organized
the
work
of
the
chicken
processing
to
separate
it
very
distinctly
from
the
work
of
the
independent
growers.
all
of
the
growing
operations--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no,
that's
right.
the
board's
position
is
that,
again,
if
the
facts
were
otherwise
the
same
as
they
are
in
this
case,
except
for
the
fact
that
holly
farms
owns
some
of
these
farms,
their
work
would
still
be
part
of
the
processing
operation.
again,
we're
simply
relying
in
part
on
petitioner's
own
characterization
and
the
way
in
which
they
organize
the
work.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
because
their
work
would
still
be
part
of
the
processing
operation
under
the
way
in
which
the
work
has
been
organized
in
this
fashion.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
in
that
case
the
work
would
be
secondary
to
farming,
and
again,
it
is--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i'm
sorry
if
i'm
not
making
it
clear.
it
is
not
a
premise
of
the
board's
position
in
this
case.
instead,
the
idea
is
that
chicken
catching
can
be
secondary
farming
under
certain
circumstances,
for
example,
if
the
work
is
done
by
an
independent
contractor
also,
if
the
farmer's...
if
the
farmer--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--well,
in
a
colloquial
sense
it's
certainly
true
that
things
can
be
incidental
to
both
one
operation
and
another
operation,
and
that's
why
part
of
the
inquiry
that's
important
under
this
court's
own
decisions
regarding
the
agricultural
exemption
is
the
way
in
which
the
work
is
organized.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
determinants
in
that
case
is
who
are
the
employees
employed
by?
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
an
appropriate
tie-breaker
in
that
situation
may
be
the
canon
of
construction
that's
been
specifically
applied
with
reference
to
the
agricultural
exemption
that
exemptions
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
nonetheless...
and
we
don't
think
that
a
tie-breaker
needs
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
the
problem--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--not
necessarily.
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case.
for
example,
if
the
employees
who
did
the
catching
and
loading
of
the
chickens
were
the
same
employees
who
were
actually
involved
in
the
raising
of
the
chickens--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes,
then
the
answer
to
that
would
be
that
they
would
be
involved
in
processing
rather
than
agriculture.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right,
or
in
that--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
there
are
a
series
of
regulations
of
the
department
of
labor
that
address
this
situation.
the
basic
regulation
has
specifically
addressed
the
contract
arrangements
for
the
raising
of
poultry,
and
that
was
first
adopted
in
1961,
recognizing
the
fact
that
this
contracting
out
of
the
raising
function
goes
back
sometime,
and
what
it
says
is
that
the
employees
of
a
processor
who
perform
work
on
a
farm
as
an
incident
to
in
conjunction
with
the
raising
of
the
poultry
on
that
farm
are
employed
in
secondary
agriculture.
so
it--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--well--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--no,
i'm--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--respectfully,
i
disagree.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
what
the
regulation
says
is,
it
makes
it
conditional
on
whether
the
work
is
done
as
an
incident
to
or
in
conjunction
with
the
primary
farming
operations
on
that
farm,
so--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that
basic
regulation
requires
an
inquiry
into,
is
this
work
incidental
to
primary
farming
operations?
the
regulation
that
addresses
that
point
state
that
an
activity
is
incidental
to
primary
farming
if
it
constitutes
an
established
part
of
agriculture,
is
subordinate
to
the
farming
operations
involved,
and
does
not
amount
to
an
independent
business.
now,
we
think
all
three
of
those
factors
support
the
board's
conclusion
in
this
case.
the
chicken-catching
and
loading
operations
isn't
an
established
part
of
agriculture
because
it's
not
ordinarily
done
by
farmers.
on
the
contrary,
the
facts
of
this
case
represent
the
overwhelming
practice
of
the
industry
to
separate
the
functions
of
raising
and
catching
so
that
the
raising
is
done
by
the
independent
contractors
and
the
catching
and
loading
and
transportation
is
done
by
the
employees
of
the
processor.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
quite
possible,
and
this
court
anticipated
that
very
situation
in
the
farmers
reservoir
company,
when
it
said,
agriculture
as
an
occupation
includes
more
than
the
elemental
processes
of
planting,
growing,
and
harvesting.
there
are
a
host
of
incidental
activities
that
are
also
necessary
to
the
process.
whether
a
particular
type
of
activity
is
agricultural
depends
in
large
measure
on
the
way
in
which
that
activity
is
organized
in
a
particular
society,
and
the
court
goes
on
to
describe
the
example
of
the
manufacture
of
farming
tools.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right,
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
and
i
think
it's
clearly
not,
because
if
a
firm
were
engaged
simply
in
the
work
of
going
from
farm
to
farm
catching
chickens,
it
wouldn't
be
ordinary
to
call
the
person
who
owns
that
business
a
farmer.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well,
i--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--well,
let
me
say
a
couple
of
more
words
about
the
regulation
that
specifically
addresses
the
incidental-to
requirement,
because
that
is
really
the
requirement
on
which
we
contend
that
petitioner's
argument
founders.
the
chicken
catching
is
not
an
established
part
of
agriculture
because
of
the
way
in
which
it
is
organized.
it
is
carried
out
by
and
large
by
employees
of
processors.
also,
it
is
not
subordinate
to
primary
farming
because
it's
not
carried
out
under
the
direction
of
the
independent
growers.
their
contractual
obligations
end
at
the
point
that
the
chickens
reach
maturity
and
are
made
available
for
processing.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
correct.
one
of
the
board's--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
is
not
the
same
regulation
as
the
one
in
which
i'm
talking
about.
it
is--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
is
on
page
27
of
our
gray
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
and
it
is
quoted
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page
of
our
gray
brief
on
the
merits,
page
27.
it's
29
c.f.r.
780.143,
and
it's
block-quoted.
the
fact
that
a
practice
performed
on
a
farm
is
not
performed
by
or
for
a
farmer
is
a
strong
indication
that
it
is
not
performed
in
connection
with
the
farming
operations
there
conducted,
and
in
order
to
decide
whether
the
work
was
done
for
a
farmer...
as
justice
o'connor
was
suggesting,
in
a
sense,
of
course,
the
removal
of
chickens
is
done
for
the
farmer,
but
in
certain
cases
it's
more
accurate
to
say
that
it's
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
processor.
at
least
that's
true
when
the
crew
works
out
of
the
processing
plant,
the
testimony
of
petitioner's
own
witness
calls
the
process--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--whether
the...
we
would
say
that
you
have
to
look
at
some
additional
factors
in
that,
however,
and
one
of
them
would
include
the
fact
that
there
is
a
good
reason
why
these
chicken
catching
operations
are
employees
of
the
processor
rather
than
employees
of
the
farmer.
the
chicken
processing
operation--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--but
the
incidental-to
requirement
requires
you
to
look
at
the
relationship
between
the
activity
to
be
classified
and
the
primary
farming
operation
that
goes
on
on
that
farm,
and
in
looking
at
the
relationship
between
those
two
activities,
i
would
submit
you
also
have
to
look
at
the
relationship
between
the
parties.
are
the
same
employees
who
are
actually
doing
the
raising
of
the
chickens
also
doing
the
catching
of
the
chickens?
in
that
case,
there's
a
very
close
correlation
between
the
two
types
of
work,
and
it
may
very
well
be
relevant,
because
it
is
the
farmer's
employees
who
are
doing
the
catching,
to
say
that
is
incidental
to
the
farming.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
and
that
independent
contractor
is
described
in
the
legislative
history
as
limited
to
doing
nothing
but
going
from
farm
to
farm
threshing
wheat
for
the
farmer.
in
that
situation,
the
firm
is
working
under
the
direction
of
the
farmer.
since
by
hypothesis
it
weren't
involved
in
processing,
you
couldn't
say
that
it's
activities
were
part
of--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--the
record
doesn't
make
that
clear.
in
fact,
the
record
doesn't
indicate
any
interaction
whatsoever
between
the
independent
growers
and
the
chicken-catching
crews,
and
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
we
believe
is
relevant.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
and
certainly
title
