justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
people
who
put
them
in
cages
are
doing
the
work
on
the
farm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
therefore
under
the
secondary
agriculture
prong
of
that
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position
that
bayside,
that
bayside
case
did
not
deal
with
that
aspect
of
the
statute,
where
the
work
was
done
on
the
farm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
and
so
as
far
as
the
driver
is
concerned,
we
would
have
to
conclude
that
holly
farms
has
regained
its
status
as
a
farmer
for
you
to
prevail
as
to
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
to
the
chicken
catchers
and
the
people
who...
the
forklift
operators,
it
is
being
done
on
a
farm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
certainly
is
incidental
to
the
farm
operation.
you
have
to
get
rid
of
the
chickens.
i
mean,
the
whole
farm
operation
is
devoted
to
raising
them
for
a
certain
period
of
time
and
then
moving
them
on
to
the
next
stage,
and
it's
incidental
to
that.
it
can't
occur
without
removing
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
position
of
the
board
is
not
reasonable
in
light
of
the
language
of
the
statute
as
to
those
two
categories
of
workers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
what's
going
on
on
the
farm
is
growing
the
chickens
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
process
requires
getting
rid
of
them
after
they're
49
days
old,
doesn't
it?
you
have
to
move
them
on
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
incidental
to
the
operation
they
have.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
may
also
be
incidental
to
processing,
but
it
certainly,
at
a
minimum,
is
incidental
to
the
farming
operation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
seamon,
any
farmer
would
tell
you
it's
incidental
to
the
farm
operation
to
get
those
chickens
out
of
there
when
they've
reached
the
right
age.
i
mean,
that
has
to
be
part
and
parcel
of
it.
anybody
who's
ever
worked
on
a
farm
knows
that.
i
think
your
argument,
or
the
argument
of
the
board
is
just
a
real
stretch
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
statute
itself
refers
to
preparation
for
market,
delivery,
storage,
et
cetera.
i
mean,
clearly
the
statute
contemplated
this
very
kind
of
thing
with
regard
to
farming.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
point
too
much,
but
it
certainly
benefits
the
farmer
to
have
the
mature
chickens
moved
out
so
the
farmer
can
get
more
money
by
raising
chicks
again.
it
helps
the
farmer.
it's
part
of
his
operation,
or
hers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
again,
it's
probably
done
for
both.
the
farmer
needs
to
get
rid
of
the
mature
pullets
in
order
to
continue
his
business
of
growing
more,
and
the
processor
needs
to
get
them
in
order
to
process
them,
and
they
both
benefit,
and
it's
incidental
to
both.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
the
statute,
if
it's
on
the
farm,
it
doesn't
matter
who
the
employer
is
if
it's
on
the
farm
and
incidental
to
or
in
conjunction
with
such
farming
operation.
that's
all
that's
important.
it's
not
who
is
the
employer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
crystal
clear
that
the
language
of
the
statute
was
included
to
bring
in,
for
instance,
the
independent
thresher
and
so
forth.
it
was
never
contemplated
that
it
had
to
be
an
employee
of
the
farmer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
don't
you
suppose
the
farmer
here
has
to
tell
the
chicken
catchers
the
chickens
that
are
49
years
old
are
in
that
particular
area--
--days
old.
--or
49
days
old--
[laughter]
--are
in
that
particular
area,
those
are
the
ones
you
have
to
go
catch,
and
you
go
in
there
and
get
those?
