mr.
roberts,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
fact,
does
a
particular
crew
go
out
and
catch
the
chickens
on
one
farm,
deliver
them,
and
go
back
to
the
same
farm,
or
does
it
cover
a
lot
of
farms
on
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
one
truck
load
take
all
the
chickens
they're
going
to
get
from
that
farm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
not
quite
my
question.
will...
are
the
various
farms
about
the
same
capacity?
all
right.
are
the
number
of
chickens
that
they
catch
more
or
less
than
they
can
get
in
one
load?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
have
to
go
back
to
the
same
farm
a
second
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
you
said
that
one
load
would
not
clean
out
the
farm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand,
but
i'm
trying
to
get...
one
crew
goes
to
farm
a.
it
picks
up
some
chickens
there.
does
it
pick
up
all
the
available
chickens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
same
load?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
got
the
impression
that
it
went
to
the
farm,
loaded
up
the
truck,
went
back
to
the
processing
plant,
and
then
came
back
to
the
farm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
a
farm
it's
already
been
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
different
truck
will
come
and
pick
them
up,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
are
you
going
to
spend
any
time
at
all
arguing
about
whether
holly
farms
is
a
farmer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
make
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying?
assuming
justice
kennedy's
example
that
the
farms
owned
by
holly
farms
did
not
have
any
kind
of
contractual
situation
just
as
this,
it's
just
that
they
happen
to
pick
an
appropriate
time
to
go
pick
up
their
chickens,
you'd
say
they
were
still
not
agricultural
workers
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it
were
a
totally
independent
chicken
catcher
who
didn't...
then
what's
the
result?
