suppose
that
holly
contracted
out
in
the
manner
in
this
case
only
half
of
its
chickens,
and
the
other
half
it
raises
on
its
own,
it
has
its
own
farms,
and
the
chicken
catchers
spend
half
their
time
on
holly's
own
farms
and
half
their
time
doing
what
they're
doing
in
this
case.
what
result
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
would
be
processing
even
when
they
are
on
holly's
own
farms?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
my
hypothetical
is
that
they
spent
half
their
time
on
the
farms
where
the
chickens
are
raised
from
the
very
beginning
to
49
days,
and
half
the
day
they
go
out
and
work
on
holly's
farms
engaging
in
this
operation,
and
the
other
half
the
time
they
spend
going
out
to
these
other
farms
as
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
then
if
90
percent
of
their
time
was
spent
on
holly's
own
farms,
and
then
10
percent
of
their
time
doing
this,
the
result
would
be
that
they
would
be
farm
workers
then,
or
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
in
my
hypothetical,
half
of
their
time
is
spent
where
they're
doing
the
growing
themselves.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
workers
aren't
engaging
in
farm
work
at
that
time
either?
