justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
would
you
be
able
to
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
line
haul
drivers,
that
that
is
your
interpretation
is
the
only
reasonable
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
hard
to
say
that,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
of
course
you...
but
they
want
to
have
it
both
ways,
but
so
do
you.
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
chicken
catchers,
then
that
disparity
which
you
have
just
described
would
no
longer
exist.
you
would
have
a
relevant
farmer,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
your
argument
on
the
line
haul--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
you
also
have
to
accept
the
proposition
that
a
particular
activity
can
only
be
incidental
to
one.
it
has
to
be
either
incidental
to
the
slaughtering
operation
or
incidental
to
farming.
i
don't
know
why
it
can't
be
incidental
to
both.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
statute
requires
is
that
it
be
incidental
to
the
farming
operation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
that
you'd
have
a
real
problem
with
any
farmer
who
has
an
integrated
operation,
not
only
farms
but
slaughters,
and
then
if
these
people
who
catch
his
chickens
are
doing
things
that
are
incidental
to
both
operations,
they
presumably
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
exemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
just
like
the
case
you
describe.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
deny
that,
so
you're
another.
i
mean,
you're
doing
the
same
thing
that
they
do.
why
is
it
bad
for
them
but
okay
for
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
they
are
saying
that
he
is
not
the
farmer,
you
are
saying
that
he
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
other
issue.
we're
talking
about
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
wait
a
minute.
if
it
was
an
independent
contractor
who
did
the
catching-caging,
you
wouldn't
say
that
he
became
a
farmer,
would
you?
you'd
just
say,
he
performed
activity
incidentally...
incidental
to
farming
on
the
farm.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
mere
fact
that
holly
did
the
catching-caging
doesn't
reconvert
holly
to
a
farmer.
it
just
means
that
holly
is
doing
work
incidental
to
farming.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that
is
exactly...
that's
the
only
distinction
that
you
can
rely
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
holly
used
to
be
a
farmer.
justice
antonin
scalia
unlike
the
independent
contractor,
before
holly
dropped
off
the
little
chicks,
holly
was
a
farmer.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is,
maybe
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
sort
of
leave
it
to
the
agency
to
figure
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
even
eat
it
and
not
be
a
farmer.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
mean,
you
say
it
is
incidental
to
the
activities
that
go
on
on
the
farm.
it
is
incidental
when
an
independent
contractor
comes
in
and
does
it,
somebody
who
runs
the
business
of
catching
and
cooping
chickens.
if
he
sends
somebody
in,
it
is
incidental
to
the
farming
business.
but
if,
instead
of
contracting
with
this
independent
contractor
the
farmer
contracts
with
the
buyer
and
says,
look,
of
course
i'm
going
to
have
to
get
these
things
caught
and
cooped
before
you
can
process
them.
i
could
hire
an
independent
contractor,
but
what
say
i
sell
you
the
chickens
for
a
little
bit
less,
and
you
coop
them
and...
you
catch
them
and
coop
them
when
you
send
your
truck
to
take
them.
he
says,
okay,
that's
a
good
deal.
why
should
that
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
the
catching
and
cooping
is
incidental
to
the
farming
operation,
whether
you
choose
to
pay
an
independent
contractor
or
deduct
it
from
the
price
that
you're
selling
the
chickens
for?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
it's
his.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
neither
case
are
they
working
for
farmers.
in
one
case
they're
working
for
somebody
who's
in
a
business
of
providing
independent
contracting
employees.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
a
farmer.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
assumption,
mr.
seamon,
is,
and
i'm
sure
you'll
agree
with
this,
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
correct
assumption,
is
that
you
can
only
be
incidental
to
one
thing.
you
are
either
incidental
to
the
farming,
or
you
are
incidental
to
the
processing.
you
can't
be
incidental
to
both.
i'm
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
can
only
be
incidental
to
one
thing.
you
acknowledge
it's
incidental
to
farming.
however,
it
becomes
not
incidental
to
farming
when
it's
connected
with
a
processing
operation.
it
seems
to
me
the
premise
of
your
argument
is
you
can
only
be
incidental
to
one
thing,
and
therefore
you
must
make
the
choice
of
whether
you're
incidental
to
farming
or
incidental
to
processing,
and
i
don't
see
that
that
follows.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
certain
circumstances
you're
saying
is
the
circumstance
that
it
is
not
incidental
to
something
else,
namely
incidental
to
processing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
and
if
farming
should
develop
so
that
farmers
no
longer
feed
their
own
hogs
but
there
are
hog-feeding
companies,
then
the
feeding
of
hogs
would
no
longer
be
farming,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
read
the
last
sentence
again.
i
think
that
the
import
of
that
is
that
there
are
core
agricultural
activities,
among
which
i
would
include
the
feeding
of
hogs,
and
then
the
last
sentence
you
read
goes
to
other
things
that
are
at
the
margins,
which
may
or
may
not
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
question
is
whether
catching
a
chicken
and
putting
him
in
a
coop
so
he
can
be
taken
to
market
is
the
equivalent
of
feeding
hogs
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
why
do
they
debeak
chickens?
i
didn't
know
they
did
that.
why
do
they
do
that?
