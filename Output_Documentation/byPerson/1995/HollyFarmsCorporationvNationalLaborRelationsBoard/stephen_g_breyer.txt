stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
you
had...
suppose
i
go
into
the
business
of
supplying
water
to
people
who
are
threshing
and
they
get
thirsty,
and
each
day
i
drive
from
my
town,
in
the
middle
of
the
city,
and
i
put
water
in
my
truck,
and
i
go
out
there
and
i
give
them
cups
of
water
while
they're
threshing,
or
whatever
they're
doing.
now,
couldn't
you
say
that
such
a
person,
me,
who
goes
out
and
gives
them
water,
or
my
employees
hands
them
cups
and
so
forth,
that
that's
not
incidental
to
farming.
rather,
i
have
a
separate
business.
i'm
a
water
company.
i
live
in
the
city,
i
get
my
water
from
the
city
water,
i
go
out
and
give
them
water.
but
in
your
analysis,
that
becomes
a
farm
worker,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it
incidental
to
the
farm?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
what
i
thought
it
was
in
the
analysis--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
do
is,
they
go
out
there
and
they
hand
them
the
cups.
they
walk
around
from
corn
sheaf
to
corn
sheaf
and
help
them
drink.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is,
it
makes
a
difference
who
you're
working
for,
that
if,
in
fact,
the
water
person
was
working
for
the
farmer,
you'd
say,
hey,
this
is
incidental
to
the
farming,
but
if
the
water
person
is
working
for
a
city
water
company,
it
seems
more
incidental
to
that.
you
could
call
it
either
way,
and
how,
in
fact,
the
person...
who
is
his
employer
would
be
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he's
a
farmer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
can
i
go
back
for
a
second...
were
you
finished?
yes.
the...
as
i...
i'm
not
positive
i
have
this
chicken
thing
sorted
out
correctly,
but
let's
start
with
the
farm,
and
the
farm
is
under
contract
to
holly
hill,
is
that
right?
okay,
so
now
we
call
him
contracting
farmer
brown.
now,
if,
in
fact,
smith,
who
picks
the
chickens
up
and
puts
them
on
the
truck
and
takes
them
into
the
processing
plant,
i
take
it
if
smith
was
an
employee
of
farmer
brown,
he
would
be
covered...
exempt.
i
mean,
he'd
be
an
agricultural
laborer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
and
i
take
it
that
if
smith
were
either
himself
an
independent
contractor
or
worked
for
an
independent
contractor
like
the
independent
thresher,
he
would
be
an
exempt
agricultural
laborer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if,
in
fact,
he
happens
to
work
for
a
firm
which
is
in
the
business
of
grabbing
chickens,
transporting
them,
and
turning
them
into
sort
of
delicious
packaged
chicken,
he
does
not
become
an
agricultural
laborer,
he's
not
exempt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now...
now,
that
is
a
little
counterintuitive,
because
you'd
think
he's
going
out
there
and
picking
up
the
chickens
out
of
the
thing
the
same
way
each
time,
and
you
can't
quite
turn
to
the
contract
on
that,
i
don't
think,
because
you
can
write
the
contracts,
or
that
same
contract
with
any
of
the
three
and
you'd
come
to
different
results,
and
therefore
it
must
turn
on
something,
and
i
take
it
you'd
think
it
turns
on
the
deference
that
we
owe
somebody.
and
so
that's
my
question.
who
do
we
owe
that
deference
to,
and
exactly
what?
is
there
a
dol
regulation
that
solves
this
under
the
flsa,
because
i
take
it
that
the
board
is
trying
to
copy
the
flsa.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
so
what
we
should
look
to,
i
guess,
is
what
do
the
flsa
administrators
think
about
this,
and
i
have
some
regulations,
and
they
talk
about
transporting
plant
employees,
they
talk
about
delivery
to
market,
and
they
seem
in
talking
about
the
transporting
of
plant
employees
that
they're
not
exempt
unless
they're
the
employees
of
the
farmer,
i.e.,
of
brown.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
aren't
too
clear
on
that,
and
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
address
yourself
to.
and
also,
they
talk
about
marketing,
i.e.,
transporting
chickens,
in
this
case.
they
don't
talk
about
going
into
the
coop
and
picking
them
out,
or
going
to
a
place
where
they're
running
around
and
picking
them
out,
so
what...
to
what
extent...
i
mean,
i'm
prepared
to
give
quite
a
lot
of
weight
to
the
experts
on
this
over
in
the
fa,
but
what
has
the
flsa
said
about
this?
how
clear
have
they
made
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we've
now
got
against
you
that
it's
secondary
agriculture.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
against
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
they're
employed
by
farmer
brown.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
chicken-picking
normally
would
be,
wouldn't
it?
okay...
oh,
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
if
in
fact
the...
i
mean,
you
have
to
draw
the
line
somewhere,
and
i
guess
people
would
think
that
transporting
the
chicken,
coming
and
just
taking
the
chicken
and
bringing
it
to
the
processing
factory,
that's
fair
enough
to
call
not
agriculture,
but
you've
gone
a
little
bit
in
the
direction
of
feeding
the
hogs,
because
he's
actually
picking
the
chicken
up,
and
that's
not
quite
feeding
the
hog,
but
it's
a
step
in
that
direction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
one
problem.
but
now
go
back
to
the
regs.
that
is,
are
there
other
regs
that
help
you,
or
have
we
listed
them
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
just...
what
i
was
trying
to
do
is,
i'm
just
trying
to
list
on
my
piece
of
paper
all
the
regs
that
i
want
to
be
certain
that
i
read,
so
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
have
them
all
on
that
list,
so
just
be
sure
you
mentioned
them
all.
don't
you
have
a
reg
on
the
ownership
of
the
chicken...
i
thought
i
read
it
in
the
brief
somewhere...
that
would
be
relevant
to
look
to,
to
the
person
who
holds
title
to
the
chicken?
