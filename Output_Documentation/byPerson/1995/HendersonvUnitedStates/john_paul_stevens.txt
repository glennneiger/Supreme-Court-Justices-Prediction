justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
of
course,
the
united
states
has
the
same
interest
in
all
the
litigation
against
it.
it
really
doesn't
differentiate
the
federal
tort
claims.
let
me
ask
you
another
question
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--justice
o'connor...
may
i
just
get
this
one
out
first.
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
how
is
it
that
you
can
say
the
requirement
of...
the
permission
to
make
service
on
the
attorney
general
by
certified
mail
does
not
conflict
with
the
statute,
where
as
the
time
question
does?
that's
the
one
thing
i
just
don't
understand
your
position
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
certified
doesn't,
either,
because
that's
just
a
broader
permission
in
the
same
way
that
120
days
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
how
you
can
reconcile
your
inconsistent
positions
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
also
says
they
shall
be
served
within
120
days.
they
both
use
shall.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
certainly
requires
service
within
120
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
the
earlier
statute
had
said,
you
can
serve
in
130
days,
it
clearly
would
have
been
in
conflict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
also
want
to
be
clear,
is
a
complaint
served
within
20
days
served
forthwith?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
clearly
is
under...
the
plain
language,
certainly
forthwith
doesn't
mean
20
days,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
within
48
hours--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
certainly
you
can
always
do
it
the
same
day.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
those
cases
that
have
allowed
30
days,
or
40
days,
they're
all
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were
not
faithful
to
the
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
what
they
should
take,
what
they
are
required
by
the
plain
language
of
a
statute
to
take...
forthwith.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
once
you
acknowledge
that,
why
couldn't
the
climate
be,
well,
we
ought
to
treat
all
federal
cases
the
same?
one
hundred
and
twenty
days
is
forthwith
if
30
days
is.
why
couldn't
you
read
it
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
repealed
it
except
for
the
service
by
registered
mail.
that's
why
it's
been
impliedly
repealed--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
test
that
one...
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
court
must
disagree
with
it
in
order
to
come
out
the
way
you
want
us
to
on
the
other
issue.
