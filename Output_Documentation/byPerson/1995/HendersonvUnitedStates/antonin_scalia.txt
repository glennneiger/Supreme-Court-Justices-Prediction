justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
know,
we
use
a
lot
of
different
principles
in
trying
to
reconcile
two
statutes.
let's
assume
that
we're
dealing
with
two
statutes.
first
of
all,
we
do
have
a
principle
that
repeal
by
implication
is
not
favored.
this
would
be
a
repeal
by
implication.
secondly,
we
could
certainly
interpret,
apply
the
rule
that
where
you
have
an
apparent
conflict
the
more
specific
governs
the
more
general.
here
you
have
one
rule
governing
all
filings,
and
another
rule
governing
just
a
filing
in
the
suits
against
the
united
states
situation.
why
wouldn't
we
apply
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know,
but
we're
arguing
about
whether
it
is
intended
as
a
substitute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
the
conclusion
that
we're
driving
towards,
and
one
way
we
reconcile
conflicting
statutes
is
to
say,
well,
when
there
are
two,
the
more
specific
governs.
don't
you
think
that
the
admiralty
statute,
or
the
statute
dealing
with
suits
against
the
united
states,
covers
a
much
more
specific
situation
than
the
general
rule
4?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
just
saying
that
it's
a
bad
statute,
i
mean,
i
guess,
isn't
it?
i
don't...
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
our
decision?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
decision
is
whether
the
earlier
statute
prevails
or
the
later
rule,
and
to
say
that
the
earlier
statute
is
a
bad
statute
doesn't
affect
me
as
to
whether
it
should
prevail.
however
bad
it
is,
it
will
prevail
if
it
should.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
let
me
ask
you
about
the
government's
contention
that
there
is
no
conflict
here.
your
position
is
that
all
that
rule
4
says
is
that
it
will
be
dismissed
after
120
days,
not
that
it
can't
be
dismissed
before
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
correct?
i
take
it,
then,
that
the
government
believes
that
under
rule
83,
a
district
court
could
enact
a
provision
requiring...
requiring
service
to
be
made
sooner
than
120
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
such
a
rule
requiring
service
to
be
made
within
30
days,
for
example,
instead
of
120
is
not
inconsistent
with
rule--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
would
you
tell
me
again
why
it
is
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
by
registered
mail,
even
though
the
provision
you
say
governs
requires
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
e-mail.
are
you
going
to
allow
them
to
do
it
by
e-mail,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
only
because
e-mail
didn't
exist
when
the
federal
rule
was
written.
i
really
find
that
an
extraordinary
way
to
interpret
a
statute,
that
since
the
technology
did
not
exist
at
the
time,
you
don't
have
to
use
the
technology
that's
set
forth
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
whether
there's
a
conflict
we
would
certainly
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
the
registered
mail
point.
