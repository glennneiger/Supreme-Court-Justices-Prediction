chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-232,
henderson
v.
united
states.
mr.
sheehy,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
rule
4(j)
as
i
read
it,
mr.
sheehy,
simply
says
that
if
a
complaint
is
not...
if
service
is
not
made
on
a
defendant
within
120
days
it
shall
be
dismissed.
it
doesn't
say
you
invariably
have
120
days
in
which
to
serve
a
complaint.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
to
what
extent
are
we...
do
we
defer
to
legislative
history
in
this
area?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
discussed
by
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
bear
on
how
we
read
a
written
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not
what
4(j)
says.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
it
says
is
that
if
a
service
is
not
made
on
a
defendant
within
120
days,
it
shall
be
dismissed.
it
doesn't
say
you
invariably
have
120
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
just
weren't
able
to
put
it
into
words,
i
gather.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you're
talking
about
congressional
history,
would
you
be
very
precise
about
what
written
documents
you're
relying
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
where
do...
how
do
we
deduce
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
didn't
change
the
forthwith
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
the
forthwith
requirement,
it
tends
not
to
have
suits
decided
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
why
do
you
rely
on
something
that
was
enacted
in
1960
that
conceivably...
that,
really,
demonstrably
did
not
change
the
forthwith
requirement,
to
say
we
want
suits
decided
on
the
merits?
that
didn't
have
the
effect
of
displacing
the
forthwith
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
think
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
was
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
passed
the
forthwith
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
would
agree,
i
take
it,
that
that
tends
to...
in
fact,
your
argument
is
that
that
tends
to
determine
that
suits
won't
be
decided
on
their
merits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
have
one
act
of
congress
that
says
suits
won't
be
decided
on
their
merits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sheehy.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
government
have
a
longer
time
to
answer
a
complaint
than
a
private
litigant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sixty
days
instead
of
30?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
sheehy,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr
sheehy.
the
case
is
submitted.
