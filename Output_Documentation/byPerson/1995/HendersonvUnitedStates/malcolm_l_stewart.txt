mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
requirement
that
the
complaint
in
a
suits
in
admiralty
act
action
be
served
forthwith
upon
the
united
states
attorney
and
the
attorney
general
appears
in
the
same
code
section
upon
which
petitioner
relied
as
the
basis
for
his
suit
against
the
government.
that
provision
has
not
been
expressly
repealed,
and
petitioner's
argument
is
that
a
repeal
by
implication
has
taken
place.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
in
think
as
a
general
matter
service
of
process
would
be
more
procedural
than
substantive.
the
sub--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
would
say
that
that's
a
provision
as
to
which
we
think
certified
mail
would
be
acceptable
in
this
day
and
age.
certified--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we
would
say
it's
a
matter
of
procedure.
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
analysis
is
a
little
bit
more
complicated.
that
is,
first
of
all
we
have
to
decide
whether
there's
a
conflict,
and
we
don't
believe
that
there's
a
conflict
between
the
forthwith
service
requirement
and
4(j).
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
the
next
question
would
be
whether
the
application
of
the
federal
rule
to
an
action
against
the
government
would
have
the
effect
of
abridging
or
enlarging
substantive
rights
or
expanding
or
diminishing
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
and
we
think
that
in
this
day
and
age,
certified
and
registered
mail
are
practical
equivalents
for
the
purposes
for
which
this
requirement
was
designed.
certified
mail
didn't
exist
when
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
was
passed.
it
didn't
come
into
existence
until--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
we
would.
that
is,
even
though
this
rule--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
even
though
this
rule
was
enacted
by
act
of
congress
rather
than
promulgated
by
the
court,
we
think
that
section
20729(b)
provides
the
best
indication
of
congressional
intent.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it
is
procedural,
but
again,
the
first
question
is
whether
there's
a
conflict,
and
in
saying
that
2072(b)
in
our
view
governs
the
interpretation
of
these
statutes,
we
want
to
make
clear
that
we
regard
this
as
a
concession
rather
than
an
affirmative
claim.
that
is,
if
2072(b)
were
out
of
the
picture,
if
all
we
had
was
section
42
and
rule
4(g),
we
would
be
prepared
to
make
very
vigorously
the
argument
that
justice
scalia
was
outlining
to
the
effect
that,
even
if
there
is
a
clear
and
irreconcilable
conflict,
the
specific
statute
would
prevail
over
the
general.
we
believe
that
2072(b),
by
stating
that
a
law
in
conflict
with
a
federal
rule
is
of
no
further
force
and
effect
makes
it
difficult
for
us
to
make
that
argument,
so...
but
we
still
believe
that
2072(b)
and
its
requirement
that
laws
be
superseded
only
if
they're
in
conflict
with
the
federal
rules
governs
the
proper
construction
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
district
courts
have
local
rulemaking
authority
under
2071...
28
u.s.c.
2071,
which
says
that
the
district
courts
may
make
local
rules
not
inconsistent
with
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
federal
rules.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
we
would
say
it's
not
in
conflict
with.
i
think
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
not
inconsistent
with,
may
be
a
little
bit
different,
but
even
if
we
assume
that
they
are
the
same
thing,
i
think
we'd
have
a
different
situation
if
a
district
court
had
made
a
local
rule
that
purported
to
govern
all
federal
civil
actions.
that
is,
the
test
we've
enunciated
for
determining
whether
the
rules
are
in
conflict
is
first,
is
compliance
with
both
possible,
and
second--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
first
of
all,
the
court
in
hanna
v.
plumer
didn't
rely
on
the
language
which
says
that
laws
in
conflict
with
the
federal
rules
are
of
no
further
force
and
effect
and,
indeed,
it
didn't
frame
the
inquiry
as
whether
a
rule
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
and
i
think
the
inquiry--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
question
whether
a
particular
state
rule
should
be
incorporated
into
federal
practice
is
a
fundamentally
different
one
from
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
statute
passed
by
congress
specifically
intended
to
regulate
the
filing...
the
service
of
complaints
in
the
federal
courts
should
be
of
no
further
force
and
effect.
it's
a
serious
thing
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
an
act
of
congress
has
been
impliedly
repealed,
more
serious
than
to
say
that
a
state
rule
which
is
primarily
intended
for
state
court
actions
will
not
be
incorporated
into
federal
practice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
there...
i
remember
reading
one
district
court
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
raised
both
title
vii
and
state
law
claims,
and
the
complaint
was
served
within
120
days,
but
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
not
been
served...
the
plaintiff
had
not
exercised
diligence
in
filing
the
suit
as
promptly
as
it
could
have...
in
serving
the
complaint
as
promptly
as
it
could
have
been
filed,
and
held
that
the
lack
of
diligence
was
dispositive
as
to
dismissal
of
the
state
law
claim
but
not
as
to
the
federal
law
claim.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
lower
court
simply
haven't
passed
on
this
question
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
it
was
certainly
the
case
in
1920,
and
i
think
it
is
still
to
some
extent
the
case,
though
not
as
greatly,
that
admiralty
cases
are
different
in
the
sense
that
the
witnesses
are
ordinarily
likely
to
be
seamen,
they
may
be
transient,
they
may
take
off
at
a
moment's
notice,
it's
a
little
bit
more
difficult
to
put
your
case
together
after
the
fact,
and
congress
had
that
evidence
before
it
in
1920,
and
the
question
of
whether
changes
in
the
modern
world
have
made
that
notion
superfluous
is
really
one
for
congress
rather
than
for--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--under
the
old
rules,
it
did
not
follow
automatically
upon
service
of
a
libel
in
personam
in
admiralty,
that
the
person
would
be
arrested.
that
was
discretionary
and
it
depended
on
various
factors
set
forth
in
the
rule.
second,
as
to
what
congress
had
within
its
contemplation,
we
know
that
congress
was
informed
during
the
consideration
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
that
it
was
particularly
important
to
have
admiralty
suits
promptly
disposed
of
because
of
the
possibility
of
sailor
witnesses
disappearing.
we
don't
know
whether
that
had
anything
to
do
with
congress'
decision
to
enact
the
forthwith
service
requirement.
the
forthwith
service
requirement
was
inserted
earlier
on,
pursuant
to
a
brief
colloquy
between
the
proctor
in
admiralty
and
the
committee.
as
to
why
it
still
might
make
sense,
we
do
think
there
is
still
a
need
on
the
part
of
the
government,
albeit
a
lessened
need,
to
have
service
as
promptly
as
possible
both
in
order
to
accumulate
evidence
and
in
order
to
assess
as
accurately
as
possible
the
scope
of
its
contingent
liability.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
don't
know
that
we've
made
a
recommendation
one
way
or
the
other.
i
do
know
in--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we
would
disagree
with
that.
first
of
all,
the
requirement
that
the
complaint
be
served
forthwith
is
not
buried
in
an
obscure
provision
of
the
code.
it's
in
section
742,
the
same
section
that
petitioner's
trial
counsel
had
to
read
in
order
to
know
that
he
had
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
could
have
been
done.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
when
the
attorney
general's
office
received
the
complaint,
that
the
government
as
a
government
had
notice,
and
that
was
in
may
of
1993.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
again,
part
of
your
question,
in
essence,
goes
to
the
wisdom
of
requiring
plaintiffs
in
suits
against
the
united
states
to
serve
both
the
united
states
and
the
attorney
general,
and
a
plausible
argument
could
be
made
that
service
on
the
attorney
general
should
be
good
enough.
the
congress
that
passed
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
didn't
believe
that
to
be
the
case,
and
the
federal
rules
require--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
that
is
not
the
way
it's
done
even
under...
where
federal
rule
4(j),
or
now
4(m),
is
the
only
requirement.
that
is,
it
may
often
be
the
case
that
a
suit
is
filed
way
before
the
statute
of
limitations
is
going
to
expire,
and
the
person
may
delay
for
more
than
120
days
without
good
cause
and
may
have
his
suit
dismissed
even
though
he
could
have
dismissed
on
his
own
and
moved
for
leave
to
refile.
that's
not
an
anomaly
that's
unique
to
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
i
think
our
basic
point
is
that
in
the
individual
case
the
government
gained
something
from
immediate
service.
in
any
particular--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
in
part
it's
the
idea
that,
because
it's
the
government,
there
are
an
enormous
number
of
potential
suits
filed
against
us,
and
consequently
an
increased
desire
for
expeditious
resolution
of
each
one,
but
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
i
think...
i
think
perhaps
the
stronger
argument
for
making
a
different
rule
for
the
united
states
would
be
that
every,
potential
maritime
defendant
has
this
interest
to
some
degree,
but
as
to
suits
against
private
parties,
it
may
often
be
impracticable
to
locate
a
defendant
immediately.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
didn't
say
it
wouldn't
conflict.
we
would...
in
fact,
we
say
the
reverse.
we
say
that
the
time
provision
in
the
saa
does
not
conflict
with
the
federal
rule.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
certified
mail
i
think
is
a
closer
question.
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
provision
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
say...
says
that
the
attorney
general
shall
be
served
by
registered
or
certified
mail,
and
i
think
we
could
plausibly
read
that
as
conferring--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
actually
the
federal
rule...
rule
4(j)
doesn't
say
the
complaint
shall
be
served
within
120
days.
it
says,
a
complaint
that
is
not
served
with
120
days
shall
be
dismissed.
it
really
doesn't,
by
its
terms,
address
at
all--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
certainly
provi--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
exactly
right,
and
when
petitioner's
counsel,
mr.
sheehy,
says
that
rule
4(j)
admits
of
no
exceptions
for
particular
categories
of
cases,
we
quite
agree.
that
is,
there
is
no
statutory
provision
that
permits
a
suit
to
go
forward
when
the
complaint
has
been
served
more
than
120
days
after
filing
without
a
showing
of
good
cause.
as
to
the
prior
question
about
why
has
this...
why
has
our
view
not
been
accepted
by
the
district
courts,
i
think
it
hasn't
either
been
accepted
or
rejected
by
the
district
courts
simply
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
there
are
no
other
statutes
that
would
require
the
complaint
to
be
served
within
a
shorter
period
of
time.
there
are
two
senses
in
which
a
rule
could
be
said
to
be
exclusive.
it
could
be
exclusive
if...
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
there
is
no
categorical
answer
to
that
question.
our
view
is
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
would
agree.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we
would
say
that
forthwith
means
as
quickly
as
practicable,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--certainly
almost
always.
there
may--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we
think
that
they...
there
are
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
are
not
a
lot
of
cases.
there
are
a
couple
of
them
that
have
allowed
delays
on
the
order
of
18
to
24
days.
we
think
that
as
an
initial
matter,
that's
longer
than
the
plaintiff's
counsel
should
take.
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
i
agree
that
as
an
initial
matter
we
would
say
in
virtually
every
case
it
would
be
practicable
for
plaintiff's
counsel
to
serve
the
complaint
in
far
less
than
20
days
from
the
date
of
filing.
as
a
practical
matter,
in
terms
of
construing
the
statute
75
years
after
its
enactment,
it
may
be
that
the
cumulative
experience
of
district
courts
have
in
some
sense
contributed
a
climate
in
which
something
that
would
not
otherwise
be
reasonable
may
now
be
deemed
reasonable.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
think
the
requirement
that
the
complaint
be
served
forthwith...
clearly,
congress
was
trying
to
do
something
in
enacting
the
saa.
it
could
have
allowed
time
for
service
simply
to
be
governed
by
the
background
principles
governing
private
parties,
and
it
required
that
the
complaint
be
served--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
admiralty
rules
of
1844
and
then
of
1920
would
have
governed
the
question
of
service
upon
the
united
states
attorney.
because
the
admiralty
rules
provided
for
marshall's
service,
timing--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--all
the
admiralty
rule
said
that
when
the
libel
is
filed
with
the
court,
the
summons
is
given
to
the
marshall,
and
the
marshall
serves
it.
it
didn't
state
a
time
period.
as
a
practical
matter,
timing,
even
had
there
been
no
requirement
of
forthwith
service,
because
you
had
marshall's
service
upon
the
united
states
attorney,
timing
questions
would
have
been
unlikely
to
arise.
there
would
still
have
been
a
separate
question
of
mailing
to
the
attorney
general,
which
would
still
have
been
the
plaintiff's
responsibility.
timing
questions
could
have
arisen
then
had
the
plaintiff
been
dilatory,
and
probably
those
would
have
been
resolved
by
incorporation
of
state
law.
that
was
the
way
district
courts
tended
to
approach
procedural
questions
in
admiralty
cases
that
were
not
directly
addressed
by
the
admiralty
rules.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
way
we
would
spin
it
out,
and
certainly
either
link
in
our
chain
is
not
infallible,
we
would
say
first
the
question
is,
are
they
in
conflict,
and
we
would
say,
we
would
interpret
the
current
provision
of
the
federal
rules
that
permits
either
registered
or
certified
mail
upon
the
united
states
attorney,
or
upon
the
attorney
general,
to
confer
an
affirmative
right
to
use
either
method,
equivalent
to
a
rule
that
says
plaintiff
may
serve
by
either
registered
or
certified
mail.
second,
we
would
say
that
application
of
that
rule
to
a
suits
in
admiralty
act
action
would
not
have
the
effect
of
expanding
or
diminishing
substantive
rights,
because
for
all
practical
purposes
registered
and
certified
mails
are
now
equivalent.
the
reason
you
see
the
reference
to
registered
mail
only
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
was
simply
that
certified
mail
did
not
exist
at
that
time.
it
didn't
come
into
being
until
1955.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
if
it
was
done
by
e-mail
it
would
be
in
prohibition
of
the
federal
rules
as
well
as--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it
wouldn't
be
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
alone.
that
is,
it
would
be
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
conjunction
with
the
federal
rule,
in
conjunction
with
the
rules
enabling
act,
which
says,
all
laws
in
conflict
with
the
federal
rules
shall
be
of
no
further
force
and
effect
unless
the
effect
is
to
expand
or
diminish
substantive
rights.
so
i
think
we
would
be
doing
a
fine
analysis
under
the
rules
enabling
act.
it
wouldn't
be
that
we
were
saying
the
saa
itself
has
been
amended.
we
would
be
saying
that
the
saa
can
be
superseded.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
have
no
problem
with
that
formulation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
reason
we
think
it
survives
is
that
first,
it's
in
the
statute
and
hasn't
been
repealed.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
see
your
point,
but
in
our
view
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
requirement
simply
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
federal
rule,
and
we
have
to
presume
that
congress
used
that
phrase
for
a
reason.
that
is,
congress
could
have
said
in
the
rules
enabling
act,
all
laws
governing
procedure
in
the
federal
courts
or
all
laws
governing
the
subject
matter
covered
by
these
rules
shall
be
of
no
further
force
and
effect.
it
could
have
invoked
notions
of
field
preemption.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
they
are
in
conflict,
then
the
old
statute
is
superseded
except
to
the
extent
that
application
of
the
federal
rule
would
expand
or
diminish
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
we
have
60
days
to
answer
a
complaint.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
and
you...
the
fact...
congress
has
seen
fit
to
propound
a
special
rule
for
government
defendants
in
admiralty
cases.
it
has
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
in
this
case
and
the
case
of
the
maritime
administration
generally,
they're
cargo
ships,
and
in
fact
the
marad's
needs
as
to
staffing
levels
fluctuate
greatly
depending
upon
national
emergencies
or
need
for
transport
generally,
so
it's
not
the
case
that
people
employed
by
marad
typically
stay
employed
by
marad
for
long
periods
of
time.
the
one
point
we
do
want
to
stress
is
that
to
say
that
these
two
provisions
are
in
conflict,
and
to
state
that
as
a
general
proposition,
would,
we
think,
have
highly
disruptive
effects
on
other
areas
of
law,
both
in
terms
of
conflicts
between
federal
statutes
and
in
terms
of
federal
preemption
of
state
law.
that
is,
if
it
were
the
case
that
whenever
federal
and
state
law
generally
govern
the
same
subject
matter,
and
the
federal
law
prohibited...
permitted
something
that
the
state
law
prohibited,
the
state
law
was
thereby
preempted
because
the
two
were
in
conflict.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
holding
in
hanna
v.
plumer
was
that
the
state
law
would
be...
would
not
be
incorporated
into
federal
practice,
not
that
it
was
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
crucial
difference
between
them
is
that
the
court
there
was
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
to
incorporate
a
state
procedural
rule
that
was
intended
for...
primarily
for
use
in
the
state
courts
but
might
also
be
applied
in
federal
courts
or
in
diversity
actions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
same
thing
is
true
here,
except
that
here
the
consequence
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
a
federal
statute
passed
by
congress
specifically
to
regulate
service
of
process
in
the
federal
courts
in
this
particular
class
of
cases
will
be
held
to
be
impliedly
repealed,
and
we
think
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
cautioned
that
implied
repeals
are
disfavored.
the
court
should
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--again,
we
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
point
is,
we
get
to
that...
the
court
could
disagree
with
our
treatment
of
certified
mail.
we
get
to
that
by
saying
that
the
rule--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
because
of
the
way
that
the
rules
are
worded...
that
is,
the
rule
governing
registered
or
certified
mail
says,
shall
be
served
by--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
even
if
you
disagreed
with
us
as
to
whether
there
was
a
conflict,
it
would
still
be
plausible
to
say
that
the
difference
between...
to
permit
certified
mail
in
addition
to
registered
mail
would
not
have
the
effect
of
enlarging
or
diminishing
the
substantive
rights
of
the
parties
because
those
two
are
functional
equivalents
for
present
purposes,
whereas
to
permit
a
suit
to
go
forward
when
the
time
limitation
that
congress
deemed
important
enough
to
include
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
to
begin
with
has
not
been
complied
with
would
have
the
effect
of
both
increasing
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
and
enlarging
the
substantive
rights
of
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
i
don't--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
we're...
we're
not
backing
off
from
the
concession
that
it's
procedural.
2072(b)
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
whether
the
rule
to
be
superseded
is
procedural.
it
says
that
these
rules...
meaning
the
federal
rules...
shall
not
expand
or
diminish
substantive
rights,
and
it
can
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
we
would
analo...
we
would
say
it's
procedural
in
the
sense
that
it
deals
with
the
filing
of
documents
rather
than
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
terms
of
what
counts
for
the
decision
of
this
case,
nonapplication
of
the
forthwith
service
requirement
would
have
the
effect--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--of
expanding
or
diminishing
substantive
rights,
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
stated--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
do
disagree
with
judge
friendly
as
to
that
proposition,
yes.
