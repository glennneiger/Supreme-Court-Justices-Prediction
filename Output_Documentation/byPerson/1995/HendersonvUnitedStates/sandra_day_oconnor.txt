well,
but
there
certainly
is
room
for
another
statute,
which
we
have
here
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
to
have
a
different
requirement,
and
you
can
read
both
statutes
and
give
effect
to
both,
that
for
a
suit
in
admiralty
it
has
to
be
served
forthwith,
and
if
it's
not
a
suit
under
that
act,
then
you
might
have
a
longer
time.
i
mean,
that
is
the
argument
the
government
makes,
and
it
certainly
is
one
that
is
plausible,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
reading,
then
what
are
you
going
to
argue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
may
i
ask,
if
we
got
that
far,
and
i
don't
know
that
we
do,
section
2072
of
the
rules
enabling
act
refers
to
adoption
of
rules
by
the
supreme
court.
this
was
not
a
rule
adopted
by
the
supreme
court,
so
presumably
subsection
(b)
doesn't
apply
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
normally
we
try
to
give
effect
to
all
laws
passed
by
congress
and,
as
the
solicitor
general
argues
in
its
brief,
it
is
possible
to
interpret
and
apply
both
the
suits
in
admiralty
provision
and
the
rule
4(j)
adopted
by
congress.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
theory
they
can
work,
both
be
in
effect
at
the
same
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
just
gets
back
to
the
earlier
part
of
your
argument--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--where
we
expressed
some
disagreement
with
your
reading
of
4(j).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
is
service
of
process
a
matter
of
procedure,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
requirement,
for
instance,
in
suits
in
admiralty
act
742,
that
a
copy
must
be
sent
by
registered
mail
to
the
attorney
general
as
opposed
to
the
rule
4
provision
that
it
can
be
by
registered
or
certified
mail.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
would
say
that
that's
a
matter
of
procedure
and
that
the
rule
4
supersedes
there,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
we
get
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
but
let's
focus
for
a
minute
on
the
registered
mail
or
certified
mail,
where
you
can
see
a
conflict.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
look
to
section
2072
of
the
rules
enabling
act
to
say
that
the
rule
prevails?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
it
wasn't
adopted
by
the
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
how
about
the
time
for
notifying
the
united
states?
is
that
not
procedural
as
well?
