justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
that
would
be
a
question
of
first
view
for
us,
because
the...
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
threw
it
out
because
they
said
it
doesn't
matter
what
rule
4
means,
service
must
be
made
forthwith.
it's
only
if
you're
wrong
on
your
first
point.
if
rule
4
takes
over
all
service
against
the
united
states,
then
we
have
an
argument
about
what
4,
rule
4
means.
but
the
first
question,
i
thought
the
only
question
before
us
is,
is
the
admiralty
statute,
does
it
survive
rule
4?
may
there
be
more
than
one
way,
one
time
limit
for
serving
the
united
states,
or
was
rule
4
meant
to
cover
all
service
on
the
united
states?
is
there
any
other
instance
besides
this
admiralty
provision
where
there's
an
instruction
for
serving
the
united
states
other
than
rule
4?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i've
got
a
question
about
your
case
that
perhaps
you
can
explain
to
me.
could
you
not
have
said,
we
don't
want
to
get
into
this
whole
problem
that
time
has
run
so
long
and
there
have
been
snafus
with
the
clerk's
office,
we're
still
safe
under
the
2-year
statute
of
limitations,
we'll
just
dump
that
first
complaint,
file
a
new
complaint,
serve
it
forthwith,
and
we're
still
under
the
2-year
limit.
why
wasn't...
could
you
have
done
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
have
in
august
of
'93.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
hadn't
run
yet,
had
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
on
august
1
you
could
have
done
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
would
have
been
safer
if
he
had.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
something
else
about
why
this
was
filed
in
galveston
rather
than
houston.
what
was
that
all--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
counsel,
may
i
go
back
to
the
colloquy
you
were
just
having?
there
is
certainly
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
that
there
could
be
laws
that
would
be
displaced
by
the
rules.
that's
what
2072(b)
says.
it
says,
the
rules
can't
deal
with
substance,
but
all
laws
in
conflict
with
the
rules,
or
laws
governing
procedure
in
conflict
with
the
rules
shall
be
of
no
further
force
and
effect
once
the
rules
take
place,
so
it
was
congress
saying,
if
there
are
any
laws
governing
procedure,
those
are
displaced
by
the
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there's
a
conflict.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
come
out
of
the
blue.
i
mean,
this
forthwith
requirement
came
in
the
law
long
before
there
were
any
federal
rules,
and
so
it
was
the
rule
for
admiralty
so
you
didn't
have
to
conform
to
the
state
procedure,
you
had
something,
the
forthwith
requirement.
then
the
federal
rules
come
in
and
provide
rules
about
service
of
process,
so
i
don't
think
there
was
a
decision
that
we
didn't
want
to
get
to
cases
on
the
merits
when
the
forthwith
provision
was
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
what
point
in
time,
because
the
admiralty
rules
didn't
come
under
the
civil
rules
until
relatively
recently.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
mr.
stewart,
if
we
go
on
that,
it
seems
to
me
you're
just
saying
hanna
&
plumer
is
not
at
all
relevant
here.
i
mean,
you
could
have
service
under
the
federal
rules
and
in-hand
service
as
well,
you
could
meet
the
state
requirement
and
the
federal
requirement,
but
there,
this
court
has
said
very
clearly
the
extra
requirement
of
state
law
does
not
apply,
rule
4
governs,
because
this
is
a
procedural
matter
and
it
isn't
substantive.
why
shouldn't
the
same
apply
to
a
federal
statute
as
applied
to
the
massachusetts
law
in
the
diversity
context?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
of
course
it
couldn't
because
it
was
dealing
with
a
state
law,
not
a
federal
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
question
was,
is
it
a
procedural
question
or
a
substantive
question,
and
the
court's
position
i
thought
was,
if
the
rule
covers
it,
it
governs
procedure
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
--is
there...
there's
another
instance,...
it's
the
question
that
i
had
asked
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
instance
where
there's
a
separate
instruction
for
how
you
serve
united
states
where
the
rule
4
on
service
is
not
the
instruction.
is
there
another
statute,
other
than
this
admiralty
statute,
that
says
something
different
from
what
rule
4
says?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
is
one
of
a
kind.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
mr.
stewart,
would
you
answer
my
question,
since
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
whether
it
is
a
trap
or
not,
suppose
on
august
1st,
counsel
said,
i
see
i'm
running
into
this
technical
problem.
they
have
actual
notice,
because
the
notice
got
to
the
u.s.
attorney
and
they're
arguing
in
court
about
this,
so
i'm
going
to
withdraw
this
complaint,
start
a
new
one,
i'm
still
under
the
2-year
limit,
serve
forthwith.
that
could
have
been
done,
couldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
is...
it's
not
a
case
about
actual
notice,
because
there
was
timely
notice
to
the
attorney
general,
right,
so
it's
only
the
local
u.s.
attorney.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
did
the
united
states
have
actual
notice
of
this
lawsuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we're
not
talking
about
actual
notice
to
the
u.s.
we're
talking
about
something
that
could
have
been
cured
by
withdrawing
one
complaint
and
filing
another,
no
substantive
difference,
and
yet
the
united
states
is
insisting
that
this
is
somehow
under
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
really
is
very
strange.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
wasn't
questioning
that.
i
was
just
saying,
we
look
at
this
whole
picture,
and
we
say,
it
was
imperfect
service,
certainly,
but
there
was
actual
notice,
yes.
service
could
have
been
perfected
very
easily.
and
then
we
have
federal
rules
that
say,
you
can
amend,
and
that
relates
back...
i'm
just
wondering
in
this
case
why
we
couldn't
say,
gee,
we
should
treat
it
as
though
that
lawyer
had
filed
a
fresh
complaint.
he
still...
as
long
as
he
would
have
been
under
the
wire
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
were
those
before
the
federal
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
tell
me
what
the
period
was.
we
have
a
statute
in
19-whatever
that
says
forthwith.
what
was
it
before
there
was
that
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
stewart,
that
was
done
before
there
were
federal
rules,
and
one
can
understand
why
there
are
no
other
laws
in
conflict,
because
when
the
rulemakers
first
came
up
with
the
federal
rules,
the
admiralty
rules
were
separate,
so
the
civil
rules
saw
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
serving
the
united
states.
it
was
all
in
rule
4.
then
it
seems
somebody
wasn't
looking
in
1982
when
the
admiralty
rules
were
made
part
of
the
federal
rules.
i
don't
understand
why
there
would
be
this
special
provision
only
for
admiralty.
they're
not
the
same...
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
no
different,
and
if
we're
concerned
about
sailors
who
might
flee
to
some
foreign
country,
isn't
that
more
so
of
a
private
libel,
where
there
might
be
a
foreign
sailor...
these
are
u.s.
vessels,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't
employ
too
many
foreign
sailors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
but
that's
not--
--we
already
have
that
in
hanna
&
plumer.
we
have
exactly
that,
and
the
state
law
was...
did
have
to
be
set
aside.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
meant
that
the
massachusetts
requirement
of
in-hand
service
would
not
apply.
they
would
have
been
out
of
court
if
massachusetts
law
applied.
it
was
a
provision
that
governed
service,
and
it
didn't
apply.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
two
cases
are
very
close.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
the
consequence
that
the
case
would
be
out
of
court
as
untimely,
if
you
had
to
follow
the
state
procedure--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--say
it
was
timely,
and
the
same
thing
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
on
that
proposition
you
disagree
totally
with
judge
friendly
in--
