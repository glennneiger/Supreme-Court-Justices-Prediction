mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
good
morning,
members
of
the
court:
the
court
has
granted
review
in
this
case
on
two
issues.
first,
does
the
120-day
service
requirement
of
rule
4
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
supersede
the
forthwith
service
requirement
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act?
number
2,
if
not,
does
the
district
court
have
authority
to
extend
the
time
for
service
provided
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
under
appropriate
circumstances?
petitioner
henderson
submits
to
the
court
that
the
answers
to
both
questions
are
in
the
affirmative,
and
would
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
lower
courts
and
remand
this
case
for
trial
on
the
merits.
first,
the
120-day
requirement
in
rule
4
supersedes
the
forthwith
service
requirement
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
there
are
three
basic
reasons
for
this
conclusion.
number
1,
the
forthwith
service
requirement
is
procedural,
so
it
was
invalidated
by
the
rules
enabling
act
when
rule
4
was
amended
in
1966
and
1982.
second,
a
holding
that
the
forthwith
requirement
prevails
would
violate
and
frustrate
congressional
intent
and
the
policies
underlying
the
act
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
finally,
even
if
the
forthwith
service
requirement
is
not
procedural,
the
1982
amendments
to
the
federal
rules
were
done
by
direct
legislative
action,
so
they
would
invalidate
the
forthwith
requirement.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
comments
made
by
the
advisory
committee,
et
al.
indicate
that
the
120
rules,
there
is
no
exception
to
it,
and
that
in
fact
the
parties
have
120
days
to
serve--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--your
honor,
because
in
1982
this
particular
rule
was
reviewed
to
great
extent
by
congress,
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
submission
by
the
court
was
not
adopted
in
total
by
the
congress,
and
there
was
a
review
by
the
congress
and
this
very
issue
was
discussed,
namely,
under
what
provisions
would
the
120
days
be
put
into
the
rule.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
there
is
a...
professor
siegel
in
his
analysis
of
the
rules,
the
advisory
committee,
and
the
judicial
conference.
the
original
submission
by
this
court
to
congress
for
the
120-day
rule,
the
120
days
was
there.
there
was
a
suggestion
by
this
court
about
service
by
mail,
which
eventually
was
changed,
and
there
was
also
no
submission
by
this
court
of
a
good
cause
extension.
what
happened
is,
congress,
upon
suggestions
by
lawyers,
particularly
in
california,
concerned
about
the
certified
mail
provision
and
also
about
the
fact
that
there
was
an
absolute
120-day
shall-be-dismissed
provision,
and
the...
there
were
suggestions
made
that
were
discussed
by
professor
siegel--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--well,
my
point
exactly
is
that
the
rule
itself
says,
and
i
think
the
government
has
conceded
in
its
brief
on
page
20
that
there's
a
clear
implication
that
a
party
has
120
days
to
serve
under
rule
4,
that
there
are
no
exceptions
for
it,
it's
not
a
guideline,
it's
not
a
suggestion,
but
a
party
has
120
days,
and
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
let
us
assume
for
a
moment,
just
to
make
it
a
little
bit
clearer,
that
instead
of
forthwith,
the
act
would
have
said
50
days,
or
a
particular
number,
so
it
becomes
clear.
so
in
effect,
we
have
one
statute
that
says
the
government
can
be
sued
in
50
days
in
admiralty,
the
government
in
all
cases
can
be
sued
in
120
days.
in
effect--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--your
honor--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
understand
the
court's
position.
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
of
this,
the
discussions
that
were
going
forward,
indicate
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
have
a
bright
line
rule
and
to
make
uniform
service
in
terms
of
time
upon
all
defendants.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
well,
your
honor,
with
all
respect,
i
think
that
they
did.
i
think
the
way
that
the
statute
reads
leaves
the
clear
implication,
if
not
expressly,
that
a
party
has
120
days
before
the
court
will
dismiss
the
case,
and
the
way
that
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--well,
if
you
find
there
is
no
conflict,
then
the
rules
enabling
act
probably
does
not
apply.
now--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
and
my
point
in
the
enactment
of
rule
4
and
the
history
of
rule
4,
especially
in
the
1982
amendments,
is
that
because
the
marshalls
were
being
taken
out
of
the
process
and
prior
to
1982
it
was
more
or
less
a
due
diligence
standard
under
rule
4,
governed,
of
course,
by
the
parameters
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and
also
motions
to
dismiss
for
want
of
prosecution,
this
issue
really
did
not
arise
very
often.
in
1982,
when
the
marshalls
were
taken
out
of
the
process
to
a
large
extent,
there
was
then
a
suggestion
that
we
have
a
time
limit
in
order
to
make
sure
that
there
was
not
undue
delay,
and
i
think
that
it
is
clear
in
the
discussions
in
the
various
committees
that
there
was
a
search
for
a
bright
line
test
and
also
a
search
for
a
time
that
would
take
the
discretion
out
of
the
hands
of
the
district
court.
and,
in
fact,
there
was
a
discussion
and
a
comment
by
a
member
of
congress,
and
it's
cited
in
the
brief,
having
to
do
with
the
fact
that
we
want
to
avoid
extended
and
protracted
litigation
over
the
ambiguity
of
the
time
frames
of
rule
4.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
i
think
the
trial
counsel
probably
could
have
as
a
technical
matter.
i
suspect...
two
comments.
number
1,
the
statute
of
limitations
was
close
to
running,
because
the
statute
in
fact
ran
at
about
the
time
that
the
government
was
served,
that
is,
the
attorney
general
was
served.
number
2--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--well,
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--well,
the
statute
of
limitation
would
have
run
august
27
of
1993,
so
therefore,
it
was--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--it
was
very
close.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
probably
so.
trial
counsel
i
suspect
believed
that
he
had
120
days
in
which
to
serve,
and
therefore
there
was
no
need
to
dismiss
and
to
refile.
but
your
honor
is
correct,
and
i
think
it's
available
to
most
litigants
in
this
situation,
you
can
dismiss
and
assuming
that
the
statute
of
limitations
hasn't
run,
start
all
over
again.
but
the
attorney
general
had
received
notice
by
mail
pursuant
to
the
statute
back
in
may.
it
was
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
texas
that
created
the
problem,
and
if
the
court
will
recall,
there
was
a
problem
with
getting
the
proper
seals
from
the
district
court.
a
motion
to
effectively
extend
time
was
filed,
which
was
granted
by
the
trial
court
at
that
point
in
time,
and
again,
i
was
not
trial
counsel,
but
i
suspect
that
what
happened
is,
once
the
trial
judge
granted
that
extension,
there
was
no
reason
for
counsel
to
believe
that
he
had
to
file
the
suit
all
over
again.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
certainly
the
duplicate
effort
would
have
been
safer.
we
probably
would
not
have
been
here.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record,
but
if
i
can
make
a
couple
of
comments.
first,
galveston
is
the
port
city
for
houston.
the
galveston
court
generally
handles,
and
are
very
experienced
in
admiralty
law.
the
particular
federal
judge
there,
judge
kent,
was
a
lawyer
who
practiced
admiralty
in
the
trial
court.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
prohibition
between
filing
it
in
galveston
versus
filing
it
in
houston.
they
are
both
part
of
the
southern
district
of
texas.
but
certainly,
with
all
respect
to
the
judges
in
the
houston
division,
judge
kent
is
extremely
familiar
with
admiralty
cases.
secondly...
i
hesitate
to
raise
this
in
light
of
the
issue
that
we're
here
on,
but
also
the
docket
is
much
quicker
in
galveston
than
it
is
in
houston,
in
large
part
because
of
the
criminal
docket
in
houston,
in
the
federal
courts
there.
thirdly,
the
operator
of
the
vessel
was
lykes
brothers,
and
they
are
located
or
have
an
office
in
galveston.
and
again,
i
did
not
make
the
decision,
but
those
are
explanations
as
to
why,
and
i
think
rational
reasons
why,
the
case
was
filed
in
the
galveston
division
rather
than
the
houston
division,
although
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
it
really
doesn't
matter
much,
because
they
are
both
part
of
the
southern
district
of
texas.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
yes,
your--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--this
is
the
first
case
of
which
i'm
aware
that
reaches
this
specific
issue
about
where
you
have
a
federal
statute
dealing
with
service
and
the
rule
4
after
the
1982
amendments.
i
think
hanna
v.
plumer
certainly
deals
with
the
issue
about
whether
federal
statutes,
federal
rules
supersede
state
law
in
diversity
cases
and
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
certainly
we
can
look
to
those
cases
for
some
guidance.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
well,
in
the
class
action
case,
and
it
was
the
american
pipe
&
construction
v.
utah
where
the
court
was
interpreting
rule
23,
having
to
do
with
class
actions,
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
the
class
certification
process
would
toll
the
statute
of
limitations
of
a
federal
statute.
and
in
that
case
this
court
held
that,
in
fact,
the
procedures
and
policies
underlying
rule
23
were
such
that
the
court
did
have
the
authority
to
toll
the
statute
under
rule
23,
the
class
action.
that
is,
that
class,
people
who
would
be
members
of
the
putative
class,
would
have
the
right
to
sue
dating
back
to
the
filing
of
the
original
class
certification
action.
so
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
held
that
rule
23
allowed
that
tolling
even
though
the
petitioner
had
argued
in
that
case
that
it
should
not
because
the
remedy
and
the
statute
of
limitations
were
contained
within
the
same
statute.
in
addition,
not
exactly
directly
on
point
to
your
honor's
question,
but
in
the
sibbach
case
there
was
a
question
about
rule
35
having
to
do
with
physical
examinations,
and
there
was
an
argument
in
that
case
that
the
rule
dealing
with
physical
examinations
was
not
permissible
because,
in
fact,
it
was
such
a
fundamental
matter...
that
is,
the
examination
of
the
body...
and
the
court
held
that
in
fact
it
was
a
proper
rule
under
the
rule
enabling
act.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
well,
with
all
respect,
it
probably
held...
did
not
hold
that
there
was
a
direct
conflict.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
the
government...
i'm
sorry,
the
american
pipe
had
argued
that,
in
fact,
the
statute
required
one
thing,
and
the
rule
could
not
be
used
to
circumvent
that.
in
truth,
i
think
what
happened
was
the
court
held
that
there
is
no
direct
conflict
and,
therefore,
rule
23
could
be
used
and
the
court
was
not
bound
by
the
legislative
intent
in
that
case
'cos
it
was
not
clear,
because
it
was
not
clear.
to
answer
your
honor
directly,
this
particular
issue
dealing
with
the
forthwith
requirement
or
a
requirement
in
a
federal
statute
and
rule
4
to
my
knowledge
has
not
been
directly
addressed
by
this
court,
and
i
think
it
is
a
result
of
several
things.
number
1,
most
of
the
federal
statutes
do
not
have
this
type
of
provision
in
them,
and
number
2,
that
rule
4,
since
it
was
amended
in
1982,
has
the
120-day
rule
requirement.
the
fundamental
premise,
and
i
agree
it
is--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
yes,
and
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
followup
response
to
justice
kennedy.
the
reasons,
i
suspect,
this
has
not
come
up
is
because
the
rule
enabling
act
is
clear
in
this
area,
that
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
a
prior
procedural
statute
and
a
rule,
the
rule
is
going
to
prevail
and,
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
our
position
that
the
forthwith
requirement
is
clearly
procedural.
it
has
to
do
with
the
way
that
a
party
is
brought
into
litigation,
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
situation
where
a
method
or
timing
of
service
could
be
considered
anything
other
than
procedural.
once
we
get
to
that
conclusion,
that
is,
that
the
rule
is
procedural,
and
we
get
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
conflict,
which
i
believe
is
clearly
supported
by
the
legislative
history
and
the
committee
reports
underlying
the
1982
amendments
to
the
federal
rules,
then
it
is
our
position
that
the
rule
enabling
act
in
effect
gives
the
priority
to
rule
4.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
your
honor,
there
are
two
ways
we
can
go
at
this.
first,
our
third
point
is
that,
in
fact,
this
was
done
by
direct
legislative
action,
so
therefore
we
need
not
get
into
the
situation
about
whether
it's
procedural,
or
substantive,
or
jurisdictional,
because
if,
in
fact,
it
was
done
by
congress
as
direct
legislative
action,
that
act
would
have
equal
priority
with
the
rule
enabling
act
and
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
and
therefore
this
court
can
decide--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--and
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--but
i
think
they
only
can
be
in
theory
is
if
the
court
rules
out
or
determines
that
the
120-day
requirement
is
effectively
irrelevant.
as
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
this
particular
case,
there
are
two
timeliness
requirements
in
this
stat...
that
the
plaintiff
faced.
number
1,
the
forthwith
requirement
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
and
number
2,
the
12-day
requirement
in
rule
4.
my--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--right.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
and...
but
i
think
that
the...
that
it
is
in
my
view,
anyway,
in
the
view
of
petitioner,
it
is
clear
that
what
was
intended
in
1982
was
to
have
a
bright
line
test,
and
there
is
no
exception
in
rule
4
for
admiralty
cases.
there
is
no
indication
of
any
type
that
congress
intended
to
except
admiralty
cases
from
the
provision
of
rule
4.
now,
certainly--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--your
honor,
especially
in
the
second,
in
terms
of
the
specific
versus
general,
if
a
later
act
covers
the
subject
matter
of
the
earlier
act
and
is
intended
as
a
substitute,
then
that
rule
does
not
apply,
and
our
position
here--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
yes,
it
does
in
terms
of
service,
but
my
problem
is,
and
our
position
is,
is
that
congress
by...
and
subsequently
by
this
court,
that
by
the
enactment
of
rule
4
and
the
120-day
service
requirement
and
the
specific
methods
by
which
service
is
allowed
upon
the
government,
that
there
was
a
clear
intent
to
have
a
uniform
and
comprehensive
way
of
serving
the
government,
and
i
think
that
was
intended
to
supersede
any
prior
statutes,
and
i
think
we
believe
that
is
not
only
a
reasonable
but
a
compelling
conclusion
in
light
of
the
other
policies
and
the
other
congressional
intent
that
we
have.
and
i
understand
the
court's
position,
justice
scalia's
position
with
respect
to
general
versus
specific,
et
cetera,
but
we
also
have
a
number
of
principles
having
to
do
with
legislative
history
and
legislative
intent.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
i
never
would
designate
rules
by
this
court
as
mere
rules--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--but
i
think
either
way--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--either
way,
though,
i
think
the
petitioner
prevails.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
yes,
sir.
[laughter]
i'll
take
it.
but
i
think,
getting
back
to
justice
o'connor
and
mr.
chief
justice,
some
of
the
comments
you've
made,
and
i
want
to
talk
for
a
second
about
this
congressional
intent,
because
i
think
it
is
important,
because
i
think
the
court
has
to
view
the
whole
question
in
terms
of
congressional
intent.
what
we
know
from
the
congressional
history
is,
there
was
an
intent
to
treat--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--yes,
sir.
first,
there
is
clearly
an
intent
to
treat
the
united
states
in
these
cases
in
the
same
way
as
private
parties.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
i
think
that
comes
from
the
language
of
section--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--743
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
yes,
sir,
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
and
i
think
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
court
has
addressed
at
length
the
history
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
the
shipping
act
back
in
1916
in
prior
court
opinions,
and
so
i'm
not
going
to
go
through
those
in
any
great
detail,
but
the
court
has
discussed
all
of
these
histories
together,
because
issues
having
to
do
with
the
public
vessels
act,
et
cetera,
has
arisen
before
the
court.
but
clearly,
because
it
is
set
forth
in
the
statute
itself,
there
is
that
intent
to
treat
the
united
states
as
private
parties,
both
in
rules
of
procedure
and
in
rules
of
substantive
law,
and
that
is
in
the
statute,
in
section
743
of
title
46.
secondly,
there
is
an
intent
to
have
cases
decided
on
the
merits.
of
course,
this
is
included
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1960
amendments
to
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
which
was
passed
in
order
to
broaden
the
scope
of
the
maritime
law.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
no,
sir,
it
didn't.
it
did
not--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
clear...
i
think
that
is
an
intent
of
congress
that
has
not
changed,
and
i
don't
think
it's
an
intent
of
this
court
that
has
changed.
that
is,
that
we
want
cases
decided
on
the
merits--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--rather
than
technical
aspects.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
very
unclear
as
to
what
it
was.
it
is
contained
in
about
three
lines
of
the
legislative
history
which
is
cited,
i
think
verbatim
on
page
5
of
the
government's
brief,
where
the
question--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
i
think
we
have
a
provision
of
an
act
of
congress
that
was
passed
in
1920
that
does
cast
doubt
on
whether
cases
will
be
decided
on
the
merits.
i
think
we
have
got
a
rule
that
was
suggested
by
this
court
and
adopted
by
congress
with
some
legislative
changes
in
1982
that
make
it
clear
that
we
want
cases
decided
on
the
merits.
the
trouble
with
the
forthwith
requirement,
there
are
two
problems.
the
first
problem
is
that
we
don't
know
how
many
days
is
forthwith.
there's
no
clear
understanding,
clear
rule.
we
know
that--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--but
i
think
as
a
natural
result
of
the
forthwith
requirement
there
was
a
recognition
that
the
forthwith
requirement
gave
rise
to
situations
where
the
cases
were
dismissed
short
of
the
merits
because
of
an
uncertainty
as
to
what
forthwith
meant,
and
there
is
a...
the
second
half
of
this
is,
there
is
a
disagreement
and
a
misunderstanding
as
to
the
very
definition
of
forthwith.
we
have
a
disagreement
between
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
as
to
exactly
what
it
means,
and
it's...
and
so
not
only
do
we
have
an
ambiguity
in
the
text
itself
of
forthwith,
or
the
meaning
of
forthwith,
we
have
an
ambiguity
as
to
how
many
days
does
it
mean.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
because
of
that
ambiguity
and
the
lack
of
a
bright
line
test,
there
is
a
situation
where
lawyers
representing
parties
in
admiralty
do
not
know
exactly
if
something
has,
if
a
case
has
been
filed
forthwith,
and
it
gives
rise
to
a
situation
where
cases
are
not
decided
on
the
merits,
or
the
whole
forthwith
issue
is
then
litigated
at
great
expense
to
the
parties.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
because
i
believe--
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
--leaving
aside,
and
agreeing,
perhaps,
with
the
implicit
understanding
that
it's
a
bad
statute,
that
is
not
our
position,
that
simply
because
it's
bad
this
court
has
the
authority
or
the
right
to
overturn
it.
our
position
is,
is
that
in
fact
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
have
preempted
it
to
the
rules
enabling
act.
it
has
nothing
to
do,
really,
with
whether
the
statute
is
good
or
bad,
although
i
certainly
think
the
court
can
consider
the
ramifications
of
the
forthwith
requirement
in
light
of
legislative
history,
in
light
of
the
purposes
behind
rule
182,
in
reaching
its
decision
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
were
intended
to
and,
in
fact,
did
preempt
the
forthwith
requirement.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
i
think
the
safest
position
for
petitioner
is,
it
would
have
been
after
1982,
because
we
have
not
only
the
1966
amendments,
which
unified
admiralty
and
the
civil
rules,
but
then
in
1982,
for
the
first
time
we
have,
in
our
view,
an
express
time
limitation
on
service
of
process
on
the
government,
which
is
120
days.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
will
reserve
further
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
sheehy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
two
quick
points.
number
1,
the
concession
by
the
government
that
the
certified
versus
registered
mail
analysis
that
in
effect
it
does
not
matter
in
this
procedure
is
also
important
to
another
argument
that
the
government
made
both
in
its
brief
and
at
the
beginning
here.
one
of
the
arguments
by
the
courts
that
have
discussed
this
issue
is
the
location
of
the
forthwith
requirement
being
in
section
2
of
the
act.
the
argument
is,
is
that
procedure
is
in
section
3,
substance
is
in
section
2.
the
concession
that
the
certified
mail
and
registered
mail
is,
in
fact,
procedural,
falls
into
section
2
and
therefore
casts
great
doubt
on
the
argument
that
there
should
be
a
distinction
based
on
the
location
of
the
forthwith
requirement
in
the
statute.
number
2,
the
point
that
justice
souter
was
talking
about,
namely,
a
reason
why
the
government
should
be
treated
differently
in
admiralty,
something
about
locating
sailors,
et
cetera,
three
quick
points.
number
1,
no
reason
to
treat
the
government
differently
than
private
parties
in
that
context,
because
all
parties
have
that
problem.
number
2,
there
is
no
reason
to
treat
the
government
differently
in
admiralty
cases
versus
any
other
cases
that
the
government
may
be
involved
in.
and
number
3,
recall
that
there's
a
statute
of
limitations
of
2
years.
if
there's
going
to
be
problems
with
somehow
locating
witnesses,
and
that's
the
reason
why
we
have
a
forthwith
requirement,
the
statute
of
limitations
of
2
years
is
going
to
cause
a
problem
far
beyond
any
service
requirement.
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated
in
the
brief
and
in
the
argument,
we
would
request
that
the
court
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
courts
below.
thank
you.
