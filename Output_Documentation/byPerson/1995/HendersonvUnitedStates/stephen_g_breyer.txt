justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
would
it
be?
i
mean,
if
you
tell
your
children,
if
you
don't
make
your
room
tidy
by
bedtime,
no
television.
so
then
they
clean
up
their
room,
and
you
say,
no
television.
i
didn't
say
what
would
happen
if
you
did.
you
try
that
one.
[laughter]
i
mean,
that's
why
i
say,
what
conceivable
reason
could
there
be
for
the...
what
reason
would
there
be
when
you
have
a
set
of
rules
which
say
at
the
heading,
statutes
to
the
contrary,
laws
to
the
contrary
are
to
be
wiped
out,
and
you
also
have
a
specific
congressional
statute
here,
don't
we
at
least
have
to
have
some
reason,
some
theory
why
congress
would
have
wanted
this
to
survive,
and
i
can't
think
of
one.
i
mean,
as
far
as
my
knowledge
of
this
is
concerned,
the
reason
that
they
had
this
forthwith
at
the
beginning
was
because
at
that
time
the
marshalls
served
after
you
filed
the
complaint,
and
so
it
was
always
forthwith,
and
they
didn't
want
that
rule
to
govern
because
it
happened
the
particular
admiralty
rules
required
you
to
arrest
the
defendant,
and
that
wouldn't
be
very
happy
when
the
u.s.
was
the
defendant,
and
therefore
they
wrote
this
word
into
a
statute
at
a
time
when
it
made
sense.
now
it
makes
no
sense,
and
so,
unless
it
makes
some
sense,
why
wouldn't
we
assume
that
congress
wanted
this
new
statute
that
they
passed
with
uniform
rules
to
apply?
so
what
sense
is
it,
what
reason
could
congress
have
had
for
not
wanting
to
get
rid
of
this
now
out-of-date
requirement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
any
indication
that
their
reason
for
passing
this
word
forthwith
was
other
than
what
i
said?
that
is,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
their
reason
for
putting
forthwith
in
the
statute
related
to
the
fact
that
sailors
might
leave
port,
as
opposed
to
the
fact
of
what
i'd
said,
that
the
normal
practice
was,
the
marshall
made
the
service,
it
always
happened
forthwith,
the
admiralty
rules
which
had
the
libelant
make
the
service
didn't
really
seem
to
work
because
of
the
arresting
requirement,
and
therefore
we'll
write
the
rule
forthwith,
because
that's
what
always
seems
to
happen.
that's
one
theory.
the
other
theory
is
the
sailors
are
going
to
run
back
to
england
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
view
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wouldn't
it
help
you
out
of
this
problem
you
have
if
you
simply
thought
that
later
enacted
statutes
of
congress
which
specifically
say
that
they're
overturning
laws
to
the
contrary,
or
imply
it
because
of
the
rule,
do
overturn
laws
to
the
contrary,
and
unless
there
is
some
good
reason
why
this
earlier
law
would
be
thought
to
survive,
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
then
the
only...
the
reason
that
you've
come
up
with
for
thinking
that
it
is
meant
to
survive
is
because
it
had
to
deal
in
part
with
the
disappearing
seamen
witnesses,
although
that
wasn't
a
strong
enough
reason
for
the
rules
makers
to
deal
similarly
with
private
people
whom
the
saa
was
designed
to
treat
the
government
similarly
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it's
a
later
rule
that
says
the
later...
well,
you
see
the
point.
