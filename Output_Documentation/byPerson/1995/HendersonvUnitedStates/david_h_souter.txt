justice
david
h.
souter
we've
got
a
very
peculiar
situation
in
a
way
created
by
2072(b),
i
take
it,
because
if
we
assume
there's
a
conflict,
if
this
were
a
rule
within
the
meaning
of
2072(b),
and
it's
procedural,
then
the
rule
is
going
to
prevail,
whereas
if
it's
not
a
2072(b)
rule,
and
we're
going
to
treat
it
as
a
congressional
statute,
we'd
say
that
it
wouldn't
prevail,
and
that
would
be
very
odd
to
say
that
if
it's
a
mere
rule
of
this
court
it
prevails
over
the
statute,
but
a
specific
act
of
congress
wouldn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'll
take
care
of
the
adjectives.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
would
be
very
strange
if
we
said
that
a
rule
of
this
court
would
prevail
over
the
statute
by
virtue
of
2071(b),
but
an
intentionally
enacted
rule
by
congress,
i.e.,
one
having
kind
of
prime
statutory
force,
wouldn't.
that
would
be
strange.
yes,
take
that.
he's
helping
you.
yes.
he's...
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stewart,
do
you
know
of
any
cases
in
the
district
courts
or
the
courts
of
appeals
in
which
the
120-day
requirement
has
been
read
as
you
have
read
it,
as
being
merely
an
outer
limit
rather
than
as
establishing
a
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
leaving
a
state
law
claim
aside,
then,
i
take
it
your
theory
has
never
recommended
itself
to
any
lower
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
does
the
government
gain
that
a
private
party
wouldn't
gain?
i
was
going
to
ask
you
that
question
anyway.
why
is
the
government's
interest
in
forthwith
service
somehow
different
from
that
which
a
private
defending
party
would
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean,
why?
why
does
it
matter
whether
these
enormous
number
of
suits
first
come
to
your
attention
within
10
days
or
120
days?
i
mean,
i
just
don't
see
the
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they
are
in
conflict,
then
what's
the
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
then
you're
just
backing
off
from
your
concession
that
it's
procedural.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
conceded
that
it
was.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
within
the
context
of
the
rule
that's
what
procedural
means.
it's
something
that
does
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
guess
i
was
just
misled
by
your
use
earlier
in
speaking
of
it
as
concededly
procedural.
you
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
terms
of
what
counts
for
the
decision
of
this
case,
it's
not
procedural,
it
is
substantive.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would.
