justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there
cases
from
this
court
where
we
have
held
that
the
federal
rules
supersede
a
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
this
the
first...
would
this
be
the
first
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
about
other
rules,
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
have
any
of
those
been
deemed...
or
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
because
it
contains
the
supersession
provision.
have
we
ever
interpreted
those
rules
to
supersede
a
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'll
look
again
at
american
pipe.
did
it
say
that
the
statute
was
superseded,
or
that
the
rules
would
just
be
used
to
elaborate
on
the
tolling
doctrine
that's
always
available
under
a
statute
of
limitations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
you
if
the
justice
department
had
ever
recommended
that
congress
put
the
courts
out
of
their
misery
by
repealing
this
statute.
i
take
it
from
your
answer
that
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
your
recommendation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
a
trap
for
the
attorneys.
there's
no--
