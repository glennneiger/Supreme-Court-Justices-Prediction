mr.
miller,
before
you
proceed
with
your
answer
to
that,
i'd
like
to
know
what
is
within
the
coverage.
i
understand
that
you're
arguing
about
these
devices
that
are
substantially
equivalent.
does
your
argument
go
as
well
to
the
grandparented
devices?
are
they,
too,
immune
from
tort
liability
if
there
is
a
federal
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
answer
is,
this
covers
devices
that
have
not
been
preapproved...
indeed,
the
grandparented
devices
have
never
been...
gone
through
the
510(k)
procedure,
never
been
through
any
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
hasn't
been
found
safe
and
effective,
and
that's
in
the
boilerplate
language
that
goes
out
with
the
substantially
equivalent
approvals
that
this
is
not
a
determination
by
the
fda
that
this
is
safe
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
miller,
this
act
uses
the
word
requirements
dozens
of
times.
is
it
your
argument
that
every
time
that
word
is
used
in
this
statute
it
means
the
same
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
odd,
don't
you
think,
that
with
an
agency
that
is
charged
with
regulating
food,
drugs,
medical
devices,
that
congress
would
create
this
regime
that
ousts
state
tort
remedies
for
medical
devices
but
not
for
drugs,
not
for
food,
not
for
cosmetics?
why
would
congress
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfman,
once
there
has
been...
once,
one
fine
day
when
the
fda
does
have
a
premarket
approval
setup
of
its
own,
and
a
device
does
get
that
premarket
approval,
would
there
will
be
state
tort
remedies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
i'm
sorry,
you're--
--i
was
talking
about
when
the
fda
reaches
the...
it
gets
free
market
approval.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
temporarily,
if
this
statute
works
eventually
the
way
congress
intended.
