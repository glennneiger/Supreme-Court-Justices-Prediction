mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
agrees
with
the
respondents
lohr
that
summary
judgment
should
not
have
been
granted
for
medtronic,
but
our
position
differs
somewhat
from
both
petitioner
and
respondents
in
this
case.
first,
we
do
not
agree
with
respondents'
broad
submission
that
the
act's
preemption
provision
does
not
speak
at
all
to
common
law
tort
claims.
in
our
view,
the
word
requirement
in
section
521(a)
of
the
act
encompasses
duties
imposed
by
state
common
law,
as
well
as
duties
imposed
by
state
statutory
or
regulatory
law.
conversely--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
applicable
under
the
act,
and
the
federal
act
does
not
impose...
this
point
does
not
derive
from
the
word
requirement
the
fact
that
the
federal
act
only
addresses
statutory
regulatory
requirements.
the
federal
act
only
gives
the
fda
that
authority.
but
that...
so
it's
the
applicable
under
this
chapter
rather
than
the
word
requirement
that
gives
rise
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
perhaps
not,
but
it's
state
or
political
subdivision
in
common
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
common
law
derived
from
state
courts,
the
state
supreme
court
or
whatever--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
may
be
one
possible
construction,
but
we
believe,
particularly
read
against
cipollone
and
the
use
of
the
requirement
there,
and
just
the
nature
of
state
law,
state
law
we
believe
would
also
encompass
duties
imposed
by
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
law
from
whatever
source.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
political
subdivision,
that's
correct.
conversely,
we
do
not
agree
with
medtronic's
broad
submissions
that
the
mere
fact
that
its
pacemaker
lead
received
510...
went
through
the
510(k)
process
and
was
found
to
be
substantially
equivalent
altogether
preempts
respondents'
state
law
claims.
the
federal
act
preempts
a
state
requirement
only
if
it's
different
from
or
in
addition
to
a
federal
requirement
applicable
under
the
act.
the
basic
requirement
for
class
iii,
indeed,
its
defining
characteristic
under
the
act's
definition,
is
that
it
goes
through
the
extensive
premarket
approval
process
with
one
exception.
in
this
case,
the
finding
of
substantial
equivalence
as
part
of
the
510(k)
process
served
to
exempt
the
medtronic
lead
in
this
case
from
the
pma
requirement.
in
other
words,
the
only
purpose
of
the
substantial
equivalence
determination
in
this
case
was
to
render
inapplicable
to
the
device
under
the
food
&
drug
act
the
premarket
approval
characteristic.
the
substantial
equivalence
determination
is
not
itself
a
requirement
under
the
act
for
purposes
of
preemption.
it
is
rather...
it
has
the
opposite
effect.
a
finding
of
substantial
equivalence
to
a
preamendments
device
has
the
effect
of
taking
a
class
iii
device
outside
of
the
pma
process
and
putting
it
in
the
same
category
as
a
preamendments
device.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
until
a
premarket
approval
application
is
called
for
under
the
regulations.
but
what
congress
did
with
respect
to
devices
that
were
on
the
market
before
1976
and
those
that
came
along
after
but
were
essentially
like
those
was
not
to
require
a
premarket
application
even
if
they're
in
class
iii
until
the
fda
called
for
such
an
application,
and
the
fda
has
not
done
so,
so
i
think
it's
beyond
question
that
devices
marketed
before
1976
were,
and
continue
to
be,
the
subject
of
state
law
tort
suits
for
defective
design.
we
think
it
follows
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
that
devices
found
substantially
equivalent
and
therefore
removed
from
the
premarket
approval
process
fall
into
the
same
category
and
can
also
be
subject,
properly
subject
to
state
law
defective
design--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct,
and
we
believe
that's
true.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
and
if
i
may,
there
are
several
points
there.
the
design
does
not
come
from
the
act.
it
is
not
a
requirement
imposed
by
the
fda.
it's
not
a
requirement
under
this
chapter.
the
design
originates
with
medtronics,
and
the
fda
doesn't
approve
it.
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
justice
scalia,
the
same
is
also
true
for
a
pre-'76
device.
a
pre-'76
device
could
not
be
design...
could
not
be
altered
in
its
design
in
a
major
way
without
also
going
through
the
510(k)
process,
and
yet
again,
it's
clear
that
despite
that
fact,
that
limitation
on
changing
the
design,
that
a
preamendments
device
can
be
subject
to
a
state
law
tort
suit,
so
the
requirement--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there's
nothing...
there's
no
requirement
at
all
with
respect
to
design
imposed
on
the...
on
a
preamendments
device.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
yes.
if
i
could
get
to
the
second
point,
then...
the
first
point
is
that
it's
not...
the
design
is
not
a
requirement
that
stems
from
the
fda,
it
stems
from
the
manufacturer,
but
the
second
point
is,
the
requirement
that
you're
referring
to,
if
it
is
a
requirement,
is
only
a
requirement
with
respect
to
substantial
equivalence,
it
is
not
a
requirement
with
respect
to
actual
safety
and
effectiveness.
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
just
so,
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
believe
you...
one
does,
and
the...
and
i
think
that
is
the
message
of
the
agency's
use
of
the
word
specific
requirement.
what
the
agency
means
then
is,
by
use
of
the
word
specific
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
subject
matter
congruence
as
it's
been
referred
to
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
has
to
be...
the
relevance...
there
has
to
be
subject
matter
congruence
between
the
state
requirement
and
the
federal
requirements.
the
only--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
exactly.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
no,
that
is
covered.
that
is
a
specific
regulation
applicable
to
the
device.
the
point
is,
the
specificity
comes
with
whether
a
particular
requirement
is
applicable
to
the
device,
and
what's
essential
to
defer
to
fda
on
something
like
this
is,
is
there
a
requirement
applicable
to
that
device?
if
in
the
good
manufacturing
practices
the
fda
had
regulated
only,
let's
say,
hours
of
service
of
quality
assurance
persons,
that
wouldn't
preempt
all
manufacturing
claims
against
the
agency.
one
has
to
look
at
exactly
what
the
agency
has
required,
whether
it
has
required
anything,
and
whether
the
federal...
the
state
requirements
ought
to
be
imposed
in
the
tort
action--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--covers
the
same
subject
matter.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
federal
requirement?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
it
would--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think,
again,
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
agency
had
intended
to...
whether
that
intended
to
exhaust
the
agency's
requirement
with
respect
to
labeling.
it's
possible,
for
example,
that
the
agency
could
focus
on
a
particular
problem
in
labeling
and
address
that
with
a
particular
warning,
but
not
intend
to
occupy
the
entire
field
of
labeling
in
that
circumstance.
in
other
words,
not
to
impose
anything
bedsides
the
more
general,
for
example,
requirements
for
prescription--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
to
the...
we
agree
that
those
are
requirements
within
the
meaning
of
the
preemption
provision,
but
they're
not...
but
the
state
law
claim
is
not
preempted
unless
its
shown
by
the
defendant
claiming
preemption
to
be
different
from
or
in
addition
to
the
state
law
claims,
and
at
this
summary
judgment
stage
of
the
case,
we
don't
believe
that
this
court
can
confidently
conclude
that
whatever
law
the
case
would
be
presented
to
the
jury
on
would
be
different
from
or
in
addition
to
the
general
state
requirements.
that
would
require
further
proceedings
and
looking
at
jury
instructions
down
the
road.
