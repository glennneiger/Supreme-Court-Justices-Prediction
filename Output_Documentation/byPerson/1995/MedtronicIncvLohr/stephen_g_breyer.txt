justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
you
read
the
statute
as
simply
giving
to
the
agency
the
power
to
say,
within
every
broad
reason,
which
requirements
do
what
in
respect
to
preemption?
that
would
make
the
statute
work,
and
we
know
at
least
here
one
thing
is
true.
the
agency
has
said...
i
think
it's
ambiguous.
what
they
said
is,
it
doesn't
preempt
anything
unless
there's
a
specific
requirement.
i
don't
know
if
that
has
to
be...
i
mean,
something
specific,
which
i
don't
see
here
anything
specific,
so
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
that
make
sense
in
the
statute?
we
are
going
to
preempt
things.
which
things?
well,
the
agency
has
the
power
to
tell
us
which.
that
would
seem
a
sensible
thing
to
do,
wouldn't
it,
and
isn't
that
consistent
with
the
language,
normal
practice?
we
give
lots
of
powers
to
agencies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wouldn't
it
be
a
sensible
legislative
purpose...
i
mean,
you've
given,
i've
written
down
six
different...
within
the
ambit
of,
subject
of,
subject
matter
congruence,
which
are
perfectly
sensible,
but
you've
created
them.
rather
than
taking
what
you
created,
why
not
take
what
the
agency's
created?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
miller,
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
we've
given
chevron
deference
to
an
agency
determination
regarding
preemption?
i
thought
we
gave
deference
to
those
determinations
that
the
agency
has
to
make
in
the
course
of
the
agency's
implementation
of
a
statute.
preemption
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
agency's
implementation
of
a
statute.
we
have
not
given
chevron
deference
to
an
agency's
determination
that
there
is
or
is
not
judicial
review
of
a
particular
provision
under
a
statute.
why
should--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
thought
you
might.
you
wouldn't
give
deference
to
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
word
"requirement"
in
the
statute,
which
happens
here
to
fall
within
a
preemption
section?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
something
different
about
that
word,
depending
on
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
they've
said
here
is
that
the
kinds
of
requirements
that
bring
into
play
the
preemption
are
specific
requirements.
i
mean,
that...
if
you
just
pass
a
general
thing...
hey,
manufacturers,
do
your
best.
suppose
they
wrote
that.
i
mean,
do
you
think
then,
therefore,
no
state,
no
tort
actions...
all
they
said
was,
do
your
best.
you're
saying,
that's
not
the
kind
of
requirement.
14-inch-thick
plastic
is.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know,
mr.
wolfman...
i
don't
know
if
you
know
this,
know
the
answer
to
this,
but
i
wasn't
certain
when
i
read
the
fda
regs
where
they
say
the
fda
has
to
have
established
specific
requirements
applicable
to
a
particular
device,
suppose
what
they
had
in
their
building
section
was,
every
building
used
to
manufacture
an
implant
must
have
a
smoke
detector
every
3
feet
in
the
ceiling.
that's
highly
specific,
but
it
applies
to
all
devices.
i
would
have
thought
that
was
specific
within
the
meaning
of
the
reg,
but
i've
heard
it
argued
no,
no,
you
have
to
have
a
special
section
called,
buildings
used
to
make
tampons,
building
used
to
make
hearing
aids--
[laughter]
--buildings
used...
that
would
seem
to
be
a
ridiculous
interpretation
of
this,
but
have
you
any
light
to
shed
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
regs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
they
have
to?
why
can't
congress
say
to
the
agency,
agency,
we
passed
a
general
statute
that
makes
sense
for
you
to
administer,
and
we
delegate
to
you
the
authority
to
interpret
these
words
in
a
reasonable
way,
and
if
you
have
to
interpret
them
differently
when
they
apply
to
the
state
than
the
federal
government,
so
be
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
common,
isn't
it,
in
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
doesn't
it
work
to
say
that
the
requirement
that's
federal
which
arguably
displaces
the
state
doesn't
do
it
at
all
unless
it's
a
relevant
requirement?
a
requirement
about
doors
doesn't
displace
requirements
about
hearing
aids,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
to
be
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
it
has
to
be
relevant,
how
do
we
decide
the
meaning
of
that
word,
relevant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
then
turn
to
see
what
this
agency
says?
that's
what
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
say
relevant
means,
it
has
to
be
relevant
to
safety?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
say
is,
the
relevant
requirements,
those
requirements
that
are
relevant
in
relation
to
a
particular
claim,
state
reg
or
rule,
is
a
reg
that
is
specific.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
specific
in
other
specific
requirements
applicable
to
a
particular
device.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
must
be
a
specific--
--well,
but
you
don't
mean
to
suggest,
do
you,
that
a
manufacturing
requirement
that
is
very
clear
and
it
applies
across
the
board
to
all
medical
device
manufacturing
is
not
specific?
