you're
using
addition
to
as
simply
meaning
a
state
requirement.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
it
exists,
regardless
of
its
terms,
means
that
it
is
in
addition
to,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
that
renders
the
different
from
totally
useless
verbiage.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
--going
to
manufacturing
for
a
second,
i
take
it
at
that
same
moment
that
you
refer
to,
there
were
no
manufacturing
standards
at
all
with
respect
to
devices.
they
came
later,
i
assume.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
do
you
say...
you
said
there
would
have
to
be
a
requirement
for
preemption,
so
would
there
be
preemption
with
respect
to
a
faulty
negligent
manufacturing
claim
at
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
addition-to
argument,
because
there...
the
state
cause
of
action
would
still
be
in
addition
to
anything
which
existed
under
the
federal
act
on
your
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wasn't
that
the
preemption
that
you
were
arguing
for
earlier?
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
isn't
that
language--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
you
can
read
it
either
way.
you
can
say,
the
device
means
the
specific
device,
or
you
can
say,
it
is
nondevice-specific
but
it
applies
to
this
one.
it
can
be
read
either
way,
and
since
it
can
be
read
either
way,
why
isn't
the
agency
regulation
an
appropriate
choice?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
i
take
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
are
assuming
in
your
answer
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
text,
that
the
agency
regulation
could,
consistently
with
the
text,
be
as
it
was
promulgated.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me
assume--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let
me
assume
that
that
is
correct.
it
is
still,
i
take
it,
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
preemption
provision,
is
it
not?
and
if
it
is
consistent
with
that
text,
then
the
most
your
argument
shows,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
there
is
ambiguity
in
the
use
of
the
word
requirement,
and
that
would
seem
to
me
to
open
the
door
to
exactly
the
regulation
that
the
agency
has
promulgated.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
your
argument
there
that,
assuming
a
consistent
usage
within
the
section,
the
federal
requirement
is
described
as
being
a
requirement
imposed
under
this
chapter?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
also
the
reference
in
there,
in
referring
to
the
requirement
at
the
state
level
as
being
imposed
by
a
state
or
political
subdivision,
and
particularly
the
reference
to
political
subdivision
doesn't
sound
like
something
that
would
cover
a
common
law
rule,
even
a
recovery
rule,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
true.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
would
at
least
leave
a
question,
and
since
preemption
gives
the
presumption
against
preemption,
i
would
suppose
anything
that
was
no
clearer
than
that
would
not
have
a
preemptive
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
we
would
construe
it
in
a
way
that
would
not
result
in
preemption,
isn't
that
fair?
