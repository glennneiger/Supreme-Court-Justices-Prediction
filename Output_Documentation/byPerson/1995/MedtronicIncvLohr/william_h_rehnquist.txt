we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-754,
medtronic,
inc.
v.
lora
lohr
and
the
cross-petition,
lora
lohr
v.
medtronic.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
term
requirement
is
by
no
means
self-explanatory.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it's
self-evidence
that
requirement
means
state
common
law
provisions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there's
no
possible
action
in
state
court
against
the
manufacturers
of
these
devices?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
so
far
as
the
federal
requirement,
the
state
can't
impose
its
own
common
law
and
it
can't
permit
suit
on
the
federal
requirement.
that's
an
extraordinary
sweep.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
wolfman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
full
premarket
approval
from
the
fda?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
fda
has
ruled,
not
the
states
have
ruled.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wolfman,
you're
going
so
rapidly,
you're
losing
me
a
little
bit,
and
i
think
you
may
be
losing
some
of
my
colleagues.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
from
what
you
say,
if
the
fda
chose
to
be
much
more
specific
simply
by
issuing
different
and
more
specific
regulations,
it
could
then
wipe
out
state
tort
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfman.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
