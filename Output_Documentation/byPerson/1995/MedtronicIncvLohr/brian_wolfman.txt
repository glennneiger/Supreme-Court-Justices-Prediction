mr.
brian
wolfman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
listening
to
the
argument,
and
reading
medtronic's
briefs,
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
medtronic's
arguments
is
what
the
company
does
not
say.
if
the
company
is
correct,
every
case
claiming
personal
injuries
caused
by
a
medical
device,
whether
based
on
defective
manufacture,
grossly
negligent
manufacturing
practices,
or
a
knowing
failure
to
disclose
defects
in
the
product,
all
were
swept
away
on
the
day
that
the
law
was
enacted
in
1976.
to
appreciate
why
the
company
is
wrong,
i
want
to
step
back
for
a
minute
and
explain
the
section
510(k)
process,
the
substantial
equivalent
process,
which
is
the
key
element
of
medtronic's
preemption
defense,
and
then
move
on
to
some
of
the
other
fda
rules
which
the
company
claims
totally
immunize
it
from
tort
liability.
the
4011
pacemaker
lead
implanted
in
lora
lohr
was
marketed
solely
on
the
basis
of
medtronic's
1982
claim
of
substantial
equivalence
to
a
device
marketed
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
mda,
a
device
which
the
fda
never
reviewed
at
all
for
safety
and
effectiveness.
the
510(k)
process
does
not
establish
an
device
design
requirements
that
could
possibly
preempt
ms.
lohr's
design-defect
claim.
indeed,
the
fda
itself
has
repeatedly
ruled
to
require
that
states
are
free
to
require
full
premarket
approval
for
class
iii,
like
pacemaker
leads,
class
iii
510(k)
devices--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--the
states
would
be
free,
in
that
circumstance,
because
the
device
was
only
subject
to
the
510(k)
process,
that
until
such
time
the
da
had
required
the
pma,
that
the
states
would
be
free
to
require
their
own
pma's
for
that
device,
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
justice
scalia,
that
goes--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
the
court
has
done
it
on
two
occasions
that
we
find.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes.
in
the
hillsborough
county
case,
which
is
cited
at
different
points
in
our
brief,
hillsborough
county
gave
chevron-style
deference
to
one,
just
one
sentence
in
regulatory
commentary
concerning
the
issue
in
that
case
which
was
whether
states
could
regulate
in
the
area
of
plasmapheresis
even
though
the
fda
had
already
done
so,
and
the
court
deferred.
here,
there
is
even
more
reason
for
deference,
your
honor,
because
under
360k(b),
the
exemption
from
preemption
provision,
it
really
is
necessary
for
the
fda
to
say
both
what
the
scope
of
preemption
is
and
whether
there...
an
exemption
ought
to
be
granted.
mr.
brian
wolfman
there's
the
lee--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--excuse
me.
the
lee
deadwood
case,
and
i
can
get
you
that
cite.
that
would
be
at
469
u.s.
256
at
page
261
and
262,
and
as
i
say,
there
as
well
they
gave
deference
to
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
preemption
provision,
and
for
the
reasons
i
stated,
justice
scalia,
there's
more
reason
to
do
it
here
because
more
instrumentation
is
necessary.
getting
back
to
the
510(k)
process,
as
i
say,
the
states
have
ruled
that
that
could
be
done,
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes,
that's
right,
the
fda
has
ruled,
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
is
this,
that
for
class
iii
devices
the
relevant
requirement
as
to
safety
and
effectiveness
is
clearly
the
premarket
approval.
the
statute
defines
class
iii
devices
as
devices
that
ought
to
go
through
premarket
approval.
the
fact
is,
that
has
not
happened
yet
for
pacemaker
leads
because
the
implementation
of
the
statute
has
been
delayed.
now,
there
is--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
i
think
there
would
be
state
tort
remedies.
it's
clearly
a
closer
question,
but
there
are
still
going
to
tort
remedies
for
two
reasons.
one,
as
we
address
in
our
brief
extensively,
we
do
not
believe
this
congress
in
1976
was
referring
to
state
damages
actions
when
it
was
using
term
requirement,
for
the
many
reasons
stated
in
our
brief.
secondly,
even
with
respect
to
a
pma,
there
is
no
device
design
requirement.
it
is
true
that
the
agency
allows
the
device
to
be
marketed
under
the
standards
for
premarket
approval,
but
it
never
says
to
the
manufacturer
that
your
device
has
to
be
designed
in
a
specific
manner,
and
that's
really
the
point
here.
a
jury's
finding--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
now
we're
moving
back
to
the
510(k)
process.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--to
answer
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
we
think
it
a
closer
question.
once
we
get
by
the
question
whether
damages
actions
are
covered
by
the
statute,
we
think
it
a
closer
question
as
to
whether
the
fda's
permission
to
market
the
device
under
the
pma
processes
would
preempt,
but
still
there,
there
was
no
device
design
requirement
specifically.
but
here,
and
i
think
this
is
responsive
to
justice
scalia's
question,
here
all
there
was
is
a
finding
of
equivalence,
and
the
clear
purpose
of
that
in
the
statute
was
to
ensure
that
the
grandparented
devices,
the
pre-1976
devices,
the
manufacturers
of
those
devices
did
not
obtain
a
competitive
advantage
over
the
subsequent--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i'd
be
glad
to
slow
down.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
purpose
of
it
was
not
to
gain
a
competitive
advantage
over
the
manufacturers
of
devices
who
came
later,
and
that
was
the
sole
purpose
of
it.
to
be
sure,
it
is
true,
as
your
question
indicates,
that
there
has
been
delays
in
the
implementation
of
these
processes,
but
that
doesn't
suggest
that
there
was
a
design
requirement
on
510(k)
devices.
there
is
one
other
regulation
that
the...
medtronic
relies
upon
to
say
that
there's
some
device
requirement
here
with
respect
to
this
substantial
equivalent
device,
and
that
is
a
regulation
at
807.81,
which
instructs
manufacturers
to
submit
new
510(k)
applications
for
new
devices
when
it
decides
to
alter
a
preexisting
device.
but
that
doesn't
preempt
the
lohrs'
device
design
claim
either,
because
that
regulation
doesn't
require
to
use
the
terms
of
the
statute,
doesn't
require
medtronic
to
do
anything
here,
let
alone
anything
bearing
on
the
lohrs'
claims.
the
lohrs'--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--your
honor,
i
want
to
be
clear
on
this.
that
is
a
requirement
in
the
literal
sense
of
thee
word
and
in
the
terms
of
the
statute,
but
it's
not
a
requirement
that
has
any
bearing
on
device
design,
and
as
medtronic
has
conceded--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--it
does--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--it
only
relates
to
its
substantial
equivalence.
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
what
the
lohrs
would
be
claiming
in
the
suit,
which
is
that
the
design
is
faulty.
it
was
only
to
show
that
the
device
was
equivalent--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--to
what
was
on
the
market--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
but
again,
the
requirement,
here,
is
simply
that
it
be
the
same
not
for
any
reason--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--not
for
any
purpose
of
its
design,
and
as
medtronic
has
conceded,
there
needs
to
be
some
subject-matter
congruence.
even
if
they...
medtronic
doesn't
go
as
far
as
the
fda
regulation,
which
we
claim
is
entitled
to
deference,
the
device
specificity
regulation,
even
if
they
don't
go
that
far,
there
needs
to
be
some
subject
matter
congruence.
the
subject
matter
of
the
510(k)
process
was
only
to
show
equivalence,
that
it
be
the
same
device.
mr.
brian
wolfman
but
her
claim
is
as
to
the
design.
the
purpose
of
the
substantial
equivalence
process
was
not
to
clear
anything
about
the
design.
the
premise
of
medtronic's
argument,
starting
from
its
question
presented
in
its
opening
brief,
is
that
this
design
was
authorized
by
the
agency.
that
is
simply
not
correct.
all
the
agency
found
was
that
there
were
devices
that
were
on
the
market
in
1976
that
are
similar
to
the
device
that
was
marketed.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
precisely
right,
and
that's
our
point,
although
many
things
under
the
act...
for
instance,
the
requirement
that
manufacturers
register
with
the
agency,
they're
all
requirements,
but
to
make
any
sense
out
of
the
statute
you
have
to
at
the
very
least
concede
some
subject
matter
congruence
between
the
state
law
requirement
and
the
federal
law
requirement,
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
to
be
sure,
on
the
state
law
side
mrs.
lohr's
claims
would
concern
the
safety
of
the
design
of
that
device,
but
it
does
not
do
so
on
the
federal
law
side.
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
manufacturing
defect.
the
fda...
the
mda
imposes
no
requirements
regarding
the
manufacture
of
pacemaker
leads,
nor
is
the
lohrs'
claim,
even
if
you
assume
that
it
doesn't
have
to
apply
manufacturing
requirements
to
pacemaker
leads,
nor
is
the
lohrs'
manufacturing-defect
claim
different
from
or
in
addition
to
the
fda's
good
manufacturing
practices
or
gmp
regulations,
which
is
the
basis
for
their
claim
of
preemption
with
respect
to
manufacture.
let
me
use
a
few
examples
to
show
that.
assume
that
the
plaintiff
claimed
under
state
law
that
a
device
failed
because
it
was
constructed
by
untrained
personnel.
the
most
relevant
gmp
simply
states,
and
it
is
at
820.25(a),
and
it
states,
and
i
quote,
all
personnel
shall
have
the
necessary
training
to
perform
their
assigned
responsibilities
adequately.
now,
getting
back
to
some
of
the
questions
posed
by
justice
scalia,
it's
very
clear
that
her
claim
would
not
be
different
from
or
in
addition
to
that.
it
would
be
simply
a
claim
that
the
training
in
that
case
was
not
adequate.
it's...
in
other
words,
the
gmp's
just
set
out
very
basic
guidelines
for
the
proper
manufacture
of
any
consumer
product,
certainly
not
the
level
of
specificity
necessary
to
preempt,
and
that's
really
the
problem
with
all
the
arguments
the
company's
making.
they're
at
a
level
of
generality
that
is
so
high
that
it
essentially
wipes
out
not
all
state
tort
law
but
all
state
law.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
again,
we
say
that
requirement
doesn't
encompass
state
damages
actions,
but
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
let
me
use
an
example.
for
instance,
in
the
area
of
tampon
labeling,
the
agency
has
acted
specifically.
it
says
the
tampon
box
must
contain
this
warning.
to
be
sure,
if
the
state
said,
we
not
only
want
this
tampon
label
but
we
want
three
more
paragraphs,
that
would
be
in
addition
to
that.
but
to
appreciate
the
breadth
of
medtronic's
argument,
medtronic
would
claim
that
no
state
could
enforce
and
no
plaintiff
could
sue
for
injuries
based
on
a
tampon
injury
even
if
the
claim
was
that
the
federal
warning
had
just
been
omitted.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes,
i
do,
and
i
think
that
is
the...
what
you
posit
i
think
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute.
by
and
large,
when
the
agency--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--yes.
your
interpretation
saying
that
that
might
be
ridiculous
if
they
had
focused
very
specifically
on
the
need
for
smoke
detectors
at
particular
intervals,
that
might
be
sufficiently
specific
even
though
it
applied
to
devices
generally.
mr.
brian
wolfman
however,
what
the
agency
has
done
as
a
general
matter
is
focus
specifically
with
respect
to
devices
as
in
tampons
and
then
otherwise
just
step
back
and
generally
regulate
it.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i'm...
yes.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that's
right,
and
it
makes
sense.
let
me
use
an
example,
if
i
might.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
that's
right,
but
let
me
use
an
example
of
how
that
played
out
in
the
regulatory
process.
for
instance,
there
are
labeling
requirements
that
simply
say,
the
applicable
ones
here
say
that
the
device
ought
to
have
a
label,
should
have
a
label
that
lists
all
warnings,
contraindications,
and
such
forth,
very
broad.
now--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that's
the
federal
requirement.
mr.
brian
wolfman
it
applies
to
that
particular
one.
801.109(c)
applies
to
all
prescription
devices.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
the--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--but
let
me--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--let
me
explain
further.
that
is
correct,
but
let
me
explain
how
that
is
worked
out.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--let
me
explain
how
it
is
worked
out
in
terms
of
its
application.
that
pre...
that...
those
regulations
essentially
preexisted
the
mda,
because
they
applied
both
to
drugs
and
devices.
then
the
fda
later
ruled
a
couple
of
years
after
the
mda
was
enacted
that
on
the
date
the
fda
issued
regulations
specifically
with
respect
to
the
labeling
of
hearing
aids,
then
and
only
then
state
law
with
respect
to
hearing
aid
labeling
that
was
different
from
or
in
addition
to
federal
hearing
aid
requirements
would
be
preempted.
let
me
say
this,
that
if,
indeed,
both
sides
of
the
equation
are
acting
at
the
general
level,
which
is
what
your
question
is
getting
at,
whether
there
might
be
preemption
doesn't
need
to
be
answered
here,
but
at
the
very
least
they
need
to
be
acting
at
the
same
level.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
let
me
tell
you--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
correct,
justice
breyer,
and
i
suppose
i
should
amend
my
answer.
if,
in
fact,
the
fda
had
issued
preemption
regulations
which
had
that
interpretation
this
would
be
a
different
case,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
might
not
be
entitled
to
deference
under
chevron.
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
certainly
the
fda's
determination
at
the
very
least
that
the
state
and
federal
sides
of
the
equation
ought
to
be
acting
on
the
same
level
of
generality
is
certainly
permissible
construction
of
this
statute,
and
it
makes
sense
in
light
of
why
you
want
preemption.
i
mean,
right
now
the
labeling
regulation
simply
says
you
should
have
the
adequate
warnings
and
contraindications.
that
says
very
little
about
whether
it's
important
to
regulate
specifically
warning
labels
on
hearing
aids
because
of
particular
problems
with
respect
to
hearing
aids.
mr.
brian
wolfman
those
are
the
cases--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
i
don't
have...
those
are
the
two
cases
i
have.
i
think
hillsborough
county
is
very
strong
in
our
favor.
it
basically
says--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--those
are
the
cases
i
have,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
wolfman
in
sum,
as
we've
gone
through
the
three
claims
at
issue
here,
there
simply
is
no
tension
between
the
lower
state
law
claims
and
any
federal
requirements
applicable
to
the
model
4011
lead.
no
preemption
here
is
not
only
demanded
by
the
text
of
360k(a),
but
it's
consistent
with
the
act's
purposes.
on
the
heels
of
a
series
of
public
health
tragedies,
and
against
a
backdrop
in
which
tort
claims
such
as
the
lohrs'
were
commonplace,
the
mda
was
enacted
to
provide
protections
that
only
a
few
states
had
provided
previously.
to
abrogate
state
law
in
areas
where
there
are
no
specific
applicable
federal
requirements,
as
medtronic
seeks
here,
does,
as
the
fda
has
said,
to
make
consumers
worse
off
than
if
