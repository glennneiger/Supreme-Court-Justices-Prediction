mr.
arthur
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
brings
before
you
the
question
of
defining
the
scope
of
the
express
preemption
provision
in
the
medical
device
amendments
of
1976.
medical
devices
are
a
heavily
regulated
industry.
that
has
been
true
since
1976,
when
the
congress
enacted
these
medical
device
amendments
and
brought
them
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fda
and
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
it
was
designing
a
scheme
by
which
the
fda
had
basic
and
complete
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
medical
devices.
indeed,
the
legislative
history
said
that
this
preemption
provision
which
is
before
you
this
morning
acted
as
a
general
prohibition
on
non-federal
regulation.
the
provision,
which
is
set
out
on
page
4
of
the
initial
brief,
is
very,
very
broad
one,
almost
uniquely
broad.
reduced
to
what
we
think
are
its
simplest
terms,
it
basically
says
that
any
federal
requirement
under
the
medical
device
amendments
preempts
any
state
requirement
which
is
different
from
or
in
addition
to
the
federal
requirement,
and
which
relates
to
the
safety
or
effectiveness
of
the
device
or
to
any
other
matter
included
as
a
requirement
applicable
to
the
device.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
in
all
honesty,
justice
o'connor,
there
really
is
almost
nothing
in
the
legislative
history.
one
can
divine
from
the
scope
of
this
provision,
its
words,
its
very
words,
where
it
uses
any
requirement,
a
word
that
is
like
all
which
this
court
has
construed
in
norfolk
and
western
as
being
very,
very
broad.
the
language
of
this
provision,
coupled
with
the
legislative
purpose
of
establishing
a
unitary,
uniform,
national
regulatory
authority
under
the
guidance
of
statutorily
mandated
expert
advisory
committees
i
think
can
lead
only
to
the
conclusion
that
the
intent
of
congress,
although
not
expressed
as
such
in
the
legislative
history,
is
to
preclude
anything
done
by
a
state
within
the
ambit
of
a
federal
requirement--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--that
is
true,
and
we
have,
on
the
issue
of
requirement,
the
fact
that
10
courts
of
appeals
have
looked
at
that
word.
all
except
the
ninth
circuit
has
concluded
that
the
word
requirement
is
broad
and,
for
example,
embraces
common
law
claims,
a
major
point
made
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
this
court
has
construed
requirement
in
cipollone,
it
has
construed
it
in
morales,
it
has
construed
it
in
easterwood.
it
has
never
been
construed
as
a
word
of
restriction.
also--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--the
statute
itself,
almost
as
a
leitmotif,
continues
to
use
the
word
requirement
not
simply
in
the
preemption
provision,
it
uses
it
in
the
remedies
provision,
it
uses
it
in
the
510(k)
provision,
it
uses
it
in
the
manufacturing
design
provision--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--that
is
our
position.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
we
believe
that
it
was
necessary
to
write
the
provision
in
this
fashion
in
order
to
establish
the
fact
that
as
a
precursor
to
the
preemption
you
had
to
have
a
federal
requirement.
only
when
you
had
a
federal
requirement,
then
a
state
requirement
that
fell
within
the
subject
matter
of
the
federal
requirement
would
be
preempted
if
it
added
to
or
differed
from
federal
requirements.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
rational...
maybe
not
the
best,
but
a
rational
way
of
writing
it
to
achieve
congress'
goal
of
establishing
primary
jurisdiction
in
the
fda.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
two
preliminary
points,
justice
scalia.
number
1,
there
is
no
such
claim
in
this
case.
number
2,
several
courts
of
appeals
have
struggled
with
questions
like
that
and
have
agreed
unanimously
that
the
preemption
provision
embraces
identical
state
claims
or
claims
of
noncompliance
with
the
fda
requirements
or
even
claims
of
fraud
on
the
fda,
the
most
notable
being
a
first
circuit--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--there
could
be
actions
if
they
do
not
fall
within
the
ambit
of
a
federal
requirement.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
that
i
think
it's
a
perfectly
appropriate
conclusion
is,
number
1,
the
act
itself
provides
for
no
federal
private
right
of
action,
so
the
notion--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--that
does
not
leave
the
situation
remediless.
the
bargain,
or--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--justice
ginsburg,
if
a
matter
being
asserted
in
a
state-based
action
falls
within
a
federal
requirement,
it
seems
to
us
the
text
of
this
statute
precludes
it.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
let
me
clarify
something.
there
is
an
image
that
the
pre-'76
devices
are
unregulated.
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
and
the
solicitor
general
have
indicated
that
there's
never
been
a
safety
and
effectiveness
determination
with
regard
to
the
510(k)
products.
two
points.
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
we
have
put
in
the
back
of
our
reply
brief,
you
will
see
that
basically
every
medical
device
on
the
marketplace
is
regulated.
it
is
simply
wrong
to
assume
that
there
are
devices
out
there
that
are
unregulated,
that
are...
to
use
the
pejorative
word,
that
have
been
grandfathered,
or
grandpersoned.
the
truth
is,
even
a
pre-'76
device,
justice
ginsburg,
when
it
comes
onto
the
market,
must
comply
with
the
good
manufacturing
practices.
it
must
comply
with
the
labeling
requirements.
it
is
subject
to
misbranding,
adulteration,
banning,
notification,
recall,
refund,
replacement.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
is
correct,
but
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
preemption
provision,
it
does
not
say
preemption
for
safe
and
effective
devices,
it
does
not
say
preemption
for
premarket
approval
devices,
it
says
that
if
there
is
an
applicable
federal
requirement...
preemption
turns
on
requirement.
it
does
not
turn
on
approval
or--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--preemption,
because
the
scheme
of
the
statute
is
to
allow
the
fda
through
its
expert
advisory
committees
and
all
the
talent
it
brings
to
bear
on
these
devices--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
think
you
can.
if--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--one
can
argue
notice
that
there's
much
broader
preemption
if
the
state
matter
deals
with
safety
or
effectiveness.
that's
completely
preempted,
completely
preempted.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no.
the
different
from...
i
admit
there
is
an
overlap
in
those
two
provisions,
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
different
from
might
be,
instead
of
using
insulation
that's
a
1/4-of-an-inch
thick,
you
use
an
insulation
1/8th
of-an-inch
thick.
something
that
is
addition
to
may
be
the
fact...
take
justice
scalia's
hypothetical...
that
the
state
is
providing
a
damage
remedy--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--which
is
totally
unavailable--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--that
is
argued
by
the
solicitor
general.
it
is
a
position
that
we
think
does
not
hold
water.
it
is
not
a
position
the
fda
has
taken
with
any
degree
of
consistent...
consistency.
this
court
has
recognized
on
many
occasions
that
damage
remedies
regulate
and
they
require.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
number
1,
two
of
the
provisions
of
this
statute
refer
to
the
remedies
in
this
state
as
requirements.
you'll
find
that
at
352t
and
331q(1).
if
you're
looking
for
textual
consistency
in
this
statute,
this
statute
calls
the
federal
remedies
requirements.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
we
make
that
point--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--no,
i'm
sorry,
they're
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
first
level
is,
there
is
no
modifier
on
the
word,
requirement,
in
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
say,
big
requirement,
small
requirement,
specific
requirement,
or
general
requirement.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
think
it
is
open
to
some
degree
to
the
agency
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
difficulty
i'm
having
with
the
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
is
pushing,
the
identical,
take
this
simple
situation.
let's
assume
that
a
company
like
medtronic
gets
a
warning
letter
that
says,
you
have
violated
the
fda.
the
warning
letter
carries
no
sanction...
no
sanction.
it's
a
warning
letter.
it
says,
clean
up
your
act,
manufacture
this
better.
the
fda
has
that
authority,
and
in
many
instances
that's
what
it
will
do,
because
even
though
there's
a
defect,
the
product
is
basically
sound.
the
public
needs
that
product.
availability
and
innovation,
two
basic
objectives
of
the
statute.
now,
along
comes
the
district
of
columbia.
it's
got
a
financial
crisis.
its
city
council
decides
to
enact
a
statute.
it
says,
anyone
who
has
been
found
in
violation
of
the
fda
is
to
pay
a
fine
to
the
city
of
$1
million.
now,
surely...
surely
this
court
in
many
of
its
opinions
has
said
the
preemption
is
logical
when
it
interferes
with
the
federal
regime.
this
federal
regime
was
designed
to
let
the
fda
determine
what
the
qualifications
of
a
product
should
be,
when
those
qualifications
are
up
to
snuff,
not
up
to
snuff,
518
of
the
statute
lays
out
a
series
of
remedies,
and
to
permit
any
state
or
municipality
to
come
along
and
impose
in
the
name
of
identity
an
additional
sanction
seems
to
me
completely
destructive.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
oh,
there
would
be
a
universe
of
preemption
broader
than
this.
this
is
a
broad
preemption,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
broadest
conceivable.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
think
you
have
to
interpret
these
words
in
light
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
in
1976.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
presumably
they
applied
only
prospectively,
not
to
devices
implanted
prior
to
1976.
for
example,
that
is
why
much
of
the
dalkon
shield
litigation
never
came
under
this
statute
at
all.
it
preceded
the
effective
date
of
this
statute.
but
i
think
congress
did
make
it
clear
that
the
effect
of
this
provision
was
to
be
immediate,
with
the
fda
filling
in
the
gaps
of
regulation,
and
that's
what
that
appendix
a
is
all
about.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
presumably,
it
would
only
apply
to
a
device
that
fell
within
a
requirement.
for
example,
if
you
had
a
device
that
had
been
subjected
to
the
good
manufacturing
practices
provisions,
to
the
labeling
provisions--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
think
the
design
claim
would
have
been
preempted
immediately,
because
design
we
believe
is
embedded
in
substantial
equivalents.
i
know
it's
not
a
safety
and
effectiveness
determination,
but
what
is
the
requirement
of
substantial
equivalents?
the
requirement
is
that
you
must
manufacture
your
device,
your
design
of
device,
your
technological
characteristics
of
your
device,
must
be
equivalent
to
that
pre-'76
device.
that
is
a
requirement.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
510(k)
is
characterized
as
a
requirement
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
they
came
later,
and--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--analytically,
justice
souter,
if
there
was
no
federal
requirement
as
of
the
relevant
moment
in
time,
there
was
no
preemption.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
would
be
the
widest
possible
preemption.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no,
we
are
arguing
that
there
should
be,
as
a
limitation
on
the
ambit
of
preemption,
some
subject
matter
congruence.
if
you
have
a
design
requirement,
it
preempts
state
design
claims.
if
you
have
a
labeling
requirement,
it
will
preclude
state
labeling.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
to
the
development
of
regulations,
that
is
right,
justice--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--oh,
in
this
case,
those
requirements
were
in
place.
those
requirements
were
in
place
as--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--on
the
effective
date
of
pre...
of
the
substantial
equivalent
approval
for
market.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
came
in
'83,
not
'76.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
this
act
could
be
read
that
way.
it
could
be
read
to
say,
any
time
there
is
any
federal
requirement--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--any
state
requirement
is
precluded.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no,
we
are
reading
it
to
have
some
subject
matter
congruence.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
because--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--that
is
the
intention
of
subdivision
2.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
agency
has
said
it's
device-specific.
we
think
that
is
an
absolutely
untenable
reading
of
this
provision.
it
is
untenable
because
there
is
no
such
limitation
on
the
word
requirement.
we
have
noted
that
the
solicitor
general
has
conceded
that
the
manufacturing
practices--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--it
does
not
say
device-specific.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes,
applicable
to
the
device.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
it...
yes,
but--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--manufacturing
is
applicable
to
the
device.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
device-specific
to
be
applicable.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
simply
because
it
is
impracticable
to
wait
until
you
have
a
device-by-device
requirement.
that
will
never
happen.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
it
has
not
happened.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
difficulty
with
the
position,
i
believe,
is,
if
you
treat
that
word
requirement
the
same
across
the
spine
of
the
statute,
you
see
that
the
word
requirement
is
not
used
in
a
device-specific
manner.
the
best
illustration
of
that
relates
to
the
section
that
gives
authority
to
create
good
manufacturing
practices
regulation.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
word
requirement
as
used
in
that
connection
is
not
device-specific.
the
solicitor
general
has
acceded
to
the
view
that
the
good
manufacturing
practices
regulations
are
requirements.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
they
are
not
device-specific.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
we
do
not
believe
it
is
consistent
with
that
statute
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
objectives
of
congress
in
enacting
this
provision.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
believe
it
was
in
footnote
4
of
your
chevron
decision
that
it
was
pointed
out
that
this
court
is
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
statutory
construction,
and
that
an
administrative
interpretation
that
did
not
do
justice
to
the
legislative
purpose
was
not
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
except
that
the
agency
has
consistently
taken
the
position,
for
whatever
reason,
that
the
scope
of
preemption
under
this
provision
should
be
basically
nonexistent,
a
device-specific
requirement,
eviscerates
preemption
that
clearly
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
a
preemption
provision
which
is
very,
very,
very
broad.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
is
obviously
an
argument
i
find
great
sympathy
with.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
not...
not--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--not
when
the
agency's
interpretation
would
completely
eviscerate
the
provision,
and
i
think
that
is
why
the
solicitor
general's...
has
backed
away
from--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--that
is
not
what
either
the
labeling
or
the
good
manufacturing
practice
is,
or
this
matrix
we
have
put
together
suggests
in
terms
of
the
plethora
of
requirements
that
have,
in
fact,
been
imposed
on
every
device
manufacturer
pre,
post,
510(k),
pma--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--it
is
our
argument
that
when
the
use
of
the
requirements
work,
as
in
510(k),
as
in
remedies,
as
in
good
manufacturing
practices,
make
sense
in
terms
of
this
preemption
provision,
it
should
be
given
a
consistent
reading:
what
is
the
best
evidence
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do?
then
this
provision,
and
the
use
of
the
operative
word,
requirement,
in
the
critical
portions
of
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that,
of
course,
is
a
decision
for
congress
to
make,
and
it
did
make
it.
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
the
sociology
of
the
device
industry
and
the
critical
character
of
the
device
industry
as
perceived
in
the
seventies,
the
need
for
innovation,
the
need
for
