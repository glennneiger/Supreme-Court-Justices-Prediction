justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
miller,
can
i
bring
you
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
for
a
moment
that
you
didn't
get
a
chance
to
answer?
supposing
florida
passed
a
statute
and
said
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
market
any
devices
that
do
not
comply
with
the
federal
standard,
good
manufacturing
practice,
and
so
forth,
and
one
who
distributes
such
a
device
shall
be
liable
if
it
harms
anybody,
and
so
there
would
be
no
difference
between
the
state
requirement
and
the
federal
requirement.
preemption
or
no
preemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
can't
support
that
from
the
text
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
my
hypothesis
is
there's
no
difference
between
the
state
requirement
and
the
federal
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
there
in
subparagraph...
mr.
miller,
why
isn't
subparagraph
1...
it
says,
any
requirement
applicable
under
this
chapter
to
the
device.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says,
applicable
to
the
device.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn't
mean
applicable
to
some
other
device--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
there.
why
doesn't
that
indicate
that
the
statute
requires
the
device
being
currently
manufactured
and
marketed
be
like
the
one
that
was
previously
manufactured--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
why
isn't
that
a
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
has
to
be
of
the
same
design
as
the
previous
device.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
why
doesn't
that
relate
to
device
design?
i
don't
quite--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
isn't
there
a
claim--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
there
a
claim
that
the
device
should
have
been
designed
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore,
wouldn't
it
be
in...
would
it
not
violate
the
requirement
that
it
be
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
to
show
that
it
was
the
same,
and
she
says
it
ought
to
be
difference.
i
don't
quite...
really,
i'm
not
quite
catching
your
argument.
