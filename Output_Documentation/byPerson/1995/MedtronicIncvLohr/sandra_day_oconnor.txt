justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
miller,
is
there
evidence
that
you
have
found
that
congress
thought
it
was
eliminating
all
state
common
law
claims
and
would
the
action
of
congress
just
last
year
in
proposing,
at
least,
caps
on
punitive
damages
but
not
compensatory
damages
relating
to
these
devices
indicate
that
at
a
least
congress
thought
some
claims
were
preserved?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
miller,
the
fda
itself
appears
possibly
to
have
tried
to
narrow
the
meaning
of
requirement
by
using
the
words
specific
requirement
in
its
regulation,
indicating
that
perhaps
the
federal
requirement
the
statute
refers
to
must
be
device-specific
as
opposed
to
general
requirements
of
the
fda
dealing
with
manufacturing
or
labeling
that
apply
across
the
board
to
all
devices.
now,
how
do
you
deal
with
that
apparent
attempt
to
narrow
the
meaning
of
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
in
any
way
open
to
interpretation
by
the
agency,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
mr.
miller,
the
agency
has
said
it
has
to
be
device-specific.
i
don't
think
you've
addressed
that
yet.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
kneedler,
there
are
claims
here
relating
to
negligent
manufacturing
and
to
failure
to
warn,
and
there
are
fda
requirements
in
both
these
areas,
so
what's
left
of
those
claims?
