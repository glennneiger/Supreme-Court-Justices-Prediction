justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
--mr.
miller,
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
preemption
provision
not
only
excludes
common
law
actions
which
seek
to
impose
liability
for
a
mater
that
is
not
unlawful
under
the
federal
scheme,
but
even
precludes
a
state
cause
of
action
for
a
violation
of
the
federal
scheme
for
an
identical
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
is.
why,
then,
would
you
even
write
this
provision?
if
that's
the
case,
why
wouldn't
you
just
say,
there
shall
be
no
state
common...
you
know,
lawsuits
involving
these
issues,
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
bring
a
lawsuit
saying
that
the
device,
although
it
was
marketed
under,
what
is
it,
310(k)
as
being
substantially
identical
to
a
preexisting
device
was,
in
fact,
not,
and
that
the
application
claiming
that
substantial
equivalence
was
intentionally
fraudulent,
and
therefore
for
violation
of
that
310(k)
provision
i
want
damages.
what
additional
requirement
has
that
added?
what
different
or
additional
requirement
has
the
state
added
when
it
allows
that
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
helps
you?
i
say,
even
worse.
not
only
do
you
not
allow
a
state
cause
of
action,
you
allow
it
in
a
situation
where
there's
no
federal
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i--
--it's
not
a
requirement,
though.
a
damage
remedy
is
not
a
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
arguing
the
cipollone
point.
what
i'm
saying
is,
requirement
covers
any
substantive
provision
imposed
by
means
of
the
common
law,
but
how
is
the
mere
availability
of
a
common
law
lawsuit
a
requirement,
which
is
what
you're
arguing
in
order
to
exclude
lawsuits
entirely.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
is
it
somewhere
in
the
briefs,
the
sections
you're
referring
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
point,
i
want
to
look
at
the
texts.
are
the
texts
set
forth
anywhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
begs
the
question,
though.
i
mean,
because
that's
exactly
the
question,
whether
an
additional
sanction
is
an
additional
requirement.
that's
exactly
the
point
we're
arguing,
and
simply
to
say
it
violates
the
scheme
is
to
beg
the
question.
and
i
take
it
from
your
answer,
mr.
miller,
that
you're
saying
that
there
is
a
universe
of
preemption
that
is
broader
than
the
language
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
mr.
miller--
--the
states--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
states
can
impose
shipping
requirements,
according
to
what
you've
just
told
us
now.
if
there
are
no
federal
requirements
governing
manner
of
shipping,
the
states
can
impose
those.
i
really
thought
that
was
not
your
view.
i
thought
your
view
was
that
any
requirement,
even
in
a
different
category,
is
an
additional
requirement,
and
therefore
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i
thought
you
were
reading
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
impose
a
shipping--
--a
shipping--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
fda
has
ruled
that.
you
think
the
fda
has
authority
to
rule
as
to
when
the
states
are
preempted
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
they
are
by
the
statute
or
they
aren't,
unless
the
statute
says
they'll
be
preempted
when
the
fda
says
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
extraordinary
to
give
deference
to
the
agency
on
an
issue
like
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
other
case?
you
said
there
were
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
is
hillsborough
county.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
doesn't
it
have
to
be
designed
substantially,
to
be
substantially
equivalent
to
what
was
on
the
market
before,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
wolfman,
i...
what
i
don't
understand
is,
if
you
say
that
requirement
means
specific
requirement
at
one
point
in
the
preemption
provision,
why
doesn't
it
mean
specific
requirement
throughout
the
preemption
provision,
never
mind
elsewhere
in
the
act?
the
preemption
provision
reads,
except
as
provided
in
subsection
(b),
it
may
establish
or
continue
in
effect
with
respect
to
a
device
intended
for
human
use
any
requirement...
okay,
no
state
can
impose
any
requirement.
does
that
means
specific
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
requirements
are
not
eliminated,
only
specific
requirements.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
further
down,
which
is
different
from
or
in
addition
to
any
requirement
applicable
under
this
chapter.
that
also
means
specific
requirement.
if
it's
different
from
a
general
requirement
under
this
chapter,
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
have
a
state...
a
state
provision
so
long
as
its
specific,
which
contradicts
a
general
federal
requirement,
or
imposes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
requirement
you're
willing
to
accept
as
meaning
specific
requirement
wherever
it
is
used
in
that
preemption
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
requirement
is
that?
that's
the
federal
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
require...
does
it
apply
only
to
tampons,
or
does
it
apply
to
a
lot
of
other
devices?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
it's
not
covered
by
this
anyway
so
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
it,
because
you
said
that
any
requirement
which
is
different
from
a
requirement
applicable
under
this
chapter.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
requirement
is
not
a
specific
requirement--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
it
doesn't
even
come
within
in
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
think
it's
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
imagine
that
you
want
to
read
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
want
to
waste
your
time,
but
just
for
the
record,
unless
you
have
a
third
case,
hillsborough
county,
which
you
cited
as
an
example
where
we've
deferred
to
the
agency's
interpretation
of
whether
a
statute
preempts
the
state,
hillsborough
county
related
to
an
agency
regulation
as
to
whether
the
agency
regulation
was
intended
to
preempt,
assuming
the
agency
had
preemption
power,
and
lawrence
county,
the
other
case
you
gave
me,
is
not
a
preemption
case.
it's
an
agency
saying
what
funds
distributed
by
the
agency
can
be
used
for.
it's
really
not
preemption.
do
you
know
of
another--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
i
really
don't
know
of
a
case
in
which
we've
deferred
to
the
agency
as
to
preemption
of
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
an
agency
reg,
the
issue
was
whether
the
agency
reg
was
intended
by
the
agency
to
preempt,
as
it
could
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
that
be
a
permissible
construction?
i
mean,
you
would
need...
your
argument
is
not
that
it
only
includes
the
common
law,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
is
that
it
includes
both
the
common
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
statutory
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
cover
the
statutory
thing
you
would
have
to
include
or
any
subdivision.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
establish
that,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
say
that
there's
no
requirement
as
to
the
design
of
those
products.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
one,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
obligation
to
follow
that
design
originates
from
the
statute.
yes,
the
design
originally
was
made
by
somebody
else,
it
wasn't
designed
by
the
government,
but
the
government
says
you
have
to
follow
the
design
that
was
used
pre-'76.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
clear?
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
there
is.
it
has...
it
cannot
change
its
design.
if
it
changed
its
design,
it
would
be
in
violation
of
federal
law,
would
it
not,
without
approval?
