so
we're
not--
--well,
justice
scalia--
--so
we're
not
confined
to
the
language
of
the
statute
in
determining
the
scope
of
preemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
it
in
1976,
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
that
all
state
suits
were
prohibited
as
to
the
pacemaker?
what
was
the
chronological
point
at
which
the
state's
actions
in
this
case
were
preempted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
before
those
gaps
were
filled
in,
there
was
still
preemption.
as
of
the
effective
date
of
this
act,
a
pacemaker
suit
could
not
be
maintained?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
those
weren't
even
promulgated
as
of
the
time
of
the
act.
i
need
to
know
the
chronological
date
at
which
you
think
these
claims
were
preempted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
most
of
those
requirements
were
not
in
force
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
they
were
subject
to
the
regulatory
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
not
clear
when
there
was
preemption
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
statute
doesn't
talk
in
terms
of
three
universes
of
design,
manufacture,
labor...
and
it
may
talk
about
labor,
but
so
far
as
design
and
manufacture,
the
statute
does
not
make
those
distinctions.
the
statute
allows
a
certain
device
to
be
marketed,
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
doesn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
that
sweeps
way
too
broadly.
suppose
the
labeling
requirement
says
for
thousands
of
devices,
do
not
use
without
consulting
a
physician.
that's
all
it
requires.
can
there
be
a
failure-to-warn
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
there
be
a
failure-to-warn
suit
in
a
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
specific
requirement.
