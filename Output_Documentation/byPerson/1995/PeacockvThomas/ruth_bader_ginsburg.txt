justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
we
can't
resolve
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
understand...
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you
are
not
saying
there's
no
remedy
here.
what
you're
saying
is,
there
is
a
remedy
under
state
law
and
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
why...
let's
leave
erisa
out
of
this
entirely,
but
if
what's
being
charged
here
is
conduct
that
frustrates
the
collection
of
a
federal
judgment,
why
shouldn't
the
conduct
that
frustrates
the
collection
of
the
judgment
be
considered
ancillary
to
the
case
that
resulted
in
the
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
appropriate
action
was
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
was
the...
would
it
have
taken
anything
out
of
their
own
pockets?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
effect,
yes.
yes.
they
were
instructed
to
toll
the
public
to
respond
to
the
court's
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
nothing
that
involved
them--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--personally.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
fraudulent
conveyances?
how
are
they
handled
postjudgment?
is...
suppose
it's
alleged
that
the...
tru-tech
fraudulently
conveyed
whatever
they
had
in
the
till
to
peacock,
and
then
he
disbursed
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
the
problem
here,
isn't
it,
that
it
is
the
plaintiff.
the
core
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
as
i
understand
it,
is
allowing
a
defendant
who
hasn't
asked
to
litigate
not
to
be
stuck
having
to
respond
to
the
plaintiff
and
then
trying
to
recoup
himself
in
a
separate
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
notion
that
if
you
didn't
have
this
ancillary
peg,
you
would
have
only
a
suit
not
involving
a
federal
question,
assuming
you're
right
about
the
erisa
part
of
it,
between
parties
who
are
not
diverse,
and
you...
the
theory
would
be
that
the
court
ought
to
spread
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
that
far
without
any
signal
from
congress
to
do
that
just
on
its
own.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
question
that
i
asked
you,
i'm
just
not
sure
what
your
answer
was,
about
the
fraudulent
conveyance,
does
your
answer
to
me
say,
because
the
transferee
is
somebody
who
is
not
a
part
of
this
lawsuit,
that
that
would
have
to
be
a
separate
suit
in
a
federal
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could
not
be
after
the
judgment
is
rendered
latched
on
to
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
page
was
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it...
you
said
that
that's
classic
ancillary
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm...
well,
perhaps
justice
scalia
will
clarify
this
for
us,
but
i
thought
that
he
was
talking
about
pendant
jurisdiction
and
the
common
nucleus
of
facts,
which
is
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
in
any
event--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--my
basic
concern
about
the
argument
you're
making
is
that,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
standard
incidences
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
now
called
supplemental
jurisdiction,
is
for
a
defending
party
who
is
being
brought
into
a
lawsuit.
i
mean,
the
standard
incidences
are
the
compulsory
counterclaim,
bringing
in
another
party
on
the
compulsory
counterclaim,
a
claim
over,
under
rule
14...
it's
for
somebody
who's
brought
into
court
in
a
defending
posture
who
then
wants
to
litigate
another
claim
which
ordinarily
wouldn't
qualify
for
federal
court
jurisdiction,
and
so
the
court
says,
we
recognize
that
it's
unfair
to
require
a
party
to
pay
out
something
that
that
party
claims
he
can
recoup
from
a
third
party
and
make
that
into
two
lawsuits
instead
of
one.
that's
the
standard
incidences
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
few,
if
that's
your
position,
then
why
did
you
say
in
your
brief
that
you
recognize
that
the
petitioner's
argument
might
be
tenable
if
we
were
dealing
here
with
just
a
contract
claim
or
a
tort
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
would
similarly
be
the
undermining
of
the
federal
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
few--
--i
haven't
read
that
one.
which
is
that?
--you
will
concede
that
there's
a
difference
between
bringing
into
a
lawsuit
prejudgment
this
kind
of
counterclaim
that
was
involved
in
the
case
you
were...
the
dewey
case,
or
having
a
case
involving
a
race,
a
thing
that's
in
the
court
and
the
court
has
to
decide
the
interest
in
that
thing.
then
there's
a
judgment.
i
think
what
justice
breyer's
asking
you,
and
if
he's
not,
i
will
certainly
ask
you,
do
you
have
any
authority
for
the
exercise
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
after
the
judgment
is
rendered
to
then
have
a
sideshow
on
the
theory
that
the
judgment
is
being
undermined?
give
me
an
example
of
a
postjudgment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
few,
are
you
saying
that
the
federal
court,
after
a
judgment
has--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--been
rendered
as
part
of
its
ancillary
jurisdiction
can
exercise
jurisdiction
over
a
third
party,
the
transferee,
and
that's
all
part
of
this
ancillary
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any,
apart
from
reading
what
you
read,
where
a
judgment
creditor--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
then
sue
someone
who
is
not
diverse,
and
there's
no
federal
claim,
who
is
the
alleged
transferee
of
property
from
the
judgment
debtor
as
part
of
ancillary
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
none
of
those
cases
were
cases
where
the
judgment
creditor,
after
getting
the
judgment,
then
brings
an
ancillary
lawsuit
against
an
alleged
transferee,
and
we
have
that
litigation
decided
by
the
same
federal
court.
none
of
those
cases
involved
a
suit
by
the
judgment
creditor
against
someone
who
was
alleged
to
have
assets
that
were
siphoned
away
from
the
judgment
debtor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bress,
apart
from
principles,
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
of
the
kind
that
justice
breyer's
been
asking
about
and
that
i've
been
asking
about,
and
i
do
know
where
ancillary
jurisdiction
starts,
and
it
starts
with
cases
like
swift,
where
there's
somebody
in
the
defendant
posture,
and
the
court
says,
we're
going
to
allow
that
defendant
to
bring
in
somebody
else
on
the
counterclaim,
to
bring
in
someone
on
the
claim
over.
that's
the
core
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
as
congress
confirmed
in
1367.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
this
particular
rule
of
law
come
from?
what
is
its
source?
is
it
federal
common
law?
is
it
state
law?
what
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.
bress--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--south
carolina
law.
so
you're
urging
that
there's
ancillary
jurisdiction
whenever
a
controlling
shareholder
of
a
small
corporation
is
alleged
to
have
siphoned
off
assets
that
would
thwart
the
collection
of
a
federal
judgment.
that's
the
broad--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
federal
rules
do
distinguish
between
what
a
defendant
can
enlarge
and
what
a
plaintiff
can.
in
a
diversity
case,
the
defendant
is
allowed
to
have
a
claim
over
against
a
nondiverse
party.
the
plaintiff,
if
the
plaintiff
is
nondiverse,
can't
turn
over
and
sue
that
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
based
on
some
notion
that
you
ought
not
enlarge
federal
jurisdiction
except
for
a
very
good
reason.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
have
said
that
every
federal
judgment
that
has
been
alleged
to
have
been
collected
by
a
controlling
shareholder
in
a
corporation
then
becomes
a
federal
case,
even
though
the
claim
arises
under
state
law
and
there's
no
diversity.
