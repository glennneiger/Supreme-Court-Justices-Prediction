unless...
i
assume
there's
a
long
arm
statute
in
south
carolina
that
could
have
been
used
if
there
were
no
erisa
jurisdiction,
but
if
there
was
a
proper...
in
respect
of
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
no
erisa
jurisdiction,
but
that
there
is
an
independent
basis
under
federal
common
law
ancillary
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
proceed.
i
take
it
that
mr.
peacock
would
have
been
subject
to
the
long
arm
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
quick
question
on
this,
because
i
know
we
have
other
issues.
was
peacock
originally
served
in
the
original
underlying
action
under
the
nationwide
service
of
process
provision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
before
you
get
to
erisa,
or
maybe
it's
part
of
the
erisa
argument,
too,
i
take
it
you
would
have
no
argument,
or
no
objection...
maybe
you
would...
if
during
the
course
of
trial
prejudgment...
peacock's
before
the
court
and
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
brings
up
the
argument,
your
honor,
it
has
come
to
our
attention
mr.
peacock
is
in
the
process
of
beginning
to
siphon
off
assets
of
the
corporation,
and
we
want
an
order
to
tell
him
that
he
may
not
do
that,
to
preserve
your
jurisdiction
you'd
have
no
problem
with
the
court
issuing
that
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
the
court
just
issues
an
order.
they
say,
mr.
peacock,
you're
before
us,
we
haven't
adjudicated
your
connection
or
your
liability
in
this
suit,
but
you're
before
us,
and
we
want
to
make
it
clear
that
you're
violating
this
court's
order
if
you
siphon
off
any
assets
until
we
issue
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
the
court
doesn't
have
the
power
to
preserve
the
assets
of
the
corporation
that
is
before
it
when
it
has
also
before
it
the
officer
who's
taking
away
the
assets?
