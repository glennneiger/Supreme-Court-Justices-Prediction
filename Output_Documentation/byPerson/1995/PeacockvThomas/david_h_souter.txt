why
does
it
assume
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
it
assume
that?
why
does
it
assume
there's
a
violation
of
the
court
order
rather
than
a
violation
of
the
state
rule
of
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
labette,
had
the
county
commissioners
violated
the
order?
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
they
in
the
same
boat,
then,
as...
i
forget
the
person's
name--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
this
case...
peacock
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
peacock
hasn't
got
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
not
because
he's
got
the
money,
but
because
of
something
he
did
with
the
money.
in
other
words,
you're
saying,
the
commissioners
had
the
money,
and
they
could
get
the
money
back
from
the
commissioners.
that
was
the
only
way
to
get
it.
here,
you're
saying
peacock
doesn't
have
the
money,
and
he
is
being
charged
with
wrongdoing.
is
that
the
essential
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
following--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe
i
would
follow
it
better
if
i
let
you
answer
the
questions
instead
of
interrupting.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
you'd
like
that
better,
anyway.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
would
have
taken
it
out
of
their
official
pockets.
i
mean,
they
had
control
over
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right--
--what
if
the--
--go
on.
what
if
the
mandamus
were
brought
against
peacock?
is
there
any
way
that
this
judgment
could
be
satisfied
by
a
mandamus
process
against
peacock
saying,
get
the
money
back?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there...
well,
may
i
interrupt
you?
is
there
a
way
of
treating
peacock
as,
in
effect,
an
agent
or
conduit
to
effect
the
return
of
this
money
without
making
him
otherwise
personally
liable?
could
an
order
issue
against
him
saying,
get
the
money
back?
would
that
be
effective?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
effect,
an
equity
order
against
peacock,
get
the
money
back.
would
that
be
effective,
or
would
you
need
more
parties
in
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
money
had
been
paid
to
a
third
party,
hadn't
it,
so
that
assuming
you
had
a
mandatory...
assuming
you
had
a
mandatory
injunction
against
peacock
saying,
get
the
money
back,
it
is...
i
guess
it
is
possible
that
with
the
best
will
in
the
world,
peacock
would
say,
i'd
like
to,
but
i
can't
do
it,
whereas
in
labette
the
commissioners
could
levy
the
tax.
there
was
no
one
who
could
say
them
nay,
in
effect,
whereas
if
peacock
doesn't
have
the
money,
if
it's
in
a
third
party
hand,
maybe
peacock
alone
can't
do
the
job.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
dewey
on
point
in
this
respect:
i
thought
your
argument
was
tending
to
something
like
this,
that
although
on
ancillary
jurisdiction
there
are
some
issues
that
can
be
litigated
which
weren't
issue...
which
weren't
litigated
the
first
time
around.
they
can't
be
issues
of
tort-like
personal
liability,
and
yet
in
dewey,
that
tort-like
personal
liability
was
adjudicated
on
ancillary
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
dewey
stands,
you
cannot
defeat
ancillary
jurisdiction
on
kind
of
tort-like
personal
liability
as
being
the
dividing
line,
as
marking
the
point
beyond
the
outer
limit
of
ancillary
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it
was
assumed
that
the
shareholders
could
pay
over
and,
in
fact,
going
against
peacock
is
not
on
all
fours
with
that,
because
peacock
hasn't
got
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
i
stand
corrected.
i
thought
he
had
paid
it--
