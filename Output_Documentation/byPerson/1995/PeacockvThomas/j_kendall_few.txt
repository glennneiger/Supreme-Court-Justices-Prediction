mr.
j.
kendall
few
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
it's
an
honor
for
me
to
be
here
today,
particularly
with
mr.
freeman,
who
is
a
very
fine
lawyer
and
a
good
friend,
and
who
tried
his
first
case
in
1950
for
my
father,
and
the
fact
that
he
lost,
i've
never
held
that
against
him.
[laughter]
our
friends
the
amicus
in
this
case
have
pointed
out
to
us
that
there
may
actually
be
three
bases
of
jurisdiction,
where
we
have
contended
that
there
are
two,
adding
that
there
may
be
a
separate
basis
for
jurisdiction
under--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--that
certainly
takes
care
of
that
issue.
[laughter]
and
so
we
are
here
to
argue
to
the
court
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
that
is,
power
in
the
court
to
adjudicate
this
controversy
both
under
ancillary
jurisdiction
and
under
erisa,
and
i'd
like
to
start
out
by
pointing
out
what
i
think
has
been
overlooked
in
the
arguments,
and
that
is
that
although
judge
traxler,
in
this
original
order
on
jurisdiction,
which
is
found
at
page...
beginning
at
page
54a
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
although
he
did
not
use
the
term
ancillary
jurisdiction,
his
analysis
as
set
forth
on
page
57a
is
the
classic
analysis
under
ancillary
jurisdiction,
and
therefore
we
would
argue
that
a
fair
reading
of
judge
traxler's
order
would
also
provide
a
basis
for
ancillary
jurisdiction.
second--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--page
57a,
justice
ginsburg.
he
says
in
the
instant
action
plaintiff
thomas
for
his
class
is
attempting
to
satisfy
the
judgment
rendered
by
judge
anderson
in
the
previous
case
on
the
merits
of
the
plaintiff's
breach
of
fiduciary
claim
and
then,
dropping
down,
the
alleged
effect
of
these
preferential
transfers
is
that
tru-tech
is
escaping
not
only
the
duties
that
it
has
as
a
fiduciary,
but
also
the
judgment
rendered
adverse
to
it
by
judge
anderson,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
thus,
the
present
action
is
an
attempt
to
satisfy
the
former
judgment.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--under
justice
scalia's
opinion
in
kokkonen,
as
i
read
it,
justice
scalia
says
there
are
two
bases
of
ancillary
jurisdiction.
one
is
the
common
nucleus
of
facts,
which
i
understand
must
have
come
up
after
rule
69(a),
and
that
the
second
is,
where
it
is
necessary
for
the
proper
functioning
of
the
court
and
to
vindicate
the
court's
authority
and
carry
out
the
court's
judgment.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
well,
let
me
read
briefly
from
justice
scalia's
opinion
in--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--well,
all
right.
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
the
court's
opinion,
having
been
written
by
justice
scalia.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
part
of
it,
and
that's
the
part
that
comes
under
28
u.s.c.
1367,
which
is
called
supplemental
jurisdiction,
as
i
understand
it.
but
as
the
court
points
out
in
the
prevailing
opinion
in
kokkonen,
and
i'm
referring
to...
well,
i'm
not
real
good
at
finding
page
numbers,
but
it's
at
page
8...
page
4
of
the
court's
opinion.
i'll
find
that
in
just
a
minute.
generally
speaking,
we
have
asserted
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
the
very
broad
sense
of
that
term
is
sometimes
used
for
two
separate
though
sometimes
related
purposes:
1)
to
permit
disposition
by
a
single
court
of
claims
that
are
in
varying
respects
and
degrees
factually
interdependent,
and
cases
are
cited
there,
and
then
2)
to
enable
the
court
to
function
successfully.
that
is,
to
manage
its
proceedings,
vindicate
its
authority,
and
effectuate
its
judgment,
and
cases
are
cited
there,
as
well
as
wright
and
miller.
and
we
have
cited
in
support
of
that
proposition
in
addition
to
kokkonen
the
barnett
v.
united
states
case
which
also
went
back
and
quoted
the
famous
case
from
mississippi,
and
i
think
that
was
because
historically
that
came
up
as
a
mississippi
case.
that
is,
watson
v.
williams,
where
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
in
1858
said
that
a
court
without
the
power
effectually
to
protect
itself
against
the
assaults
of
the
lawless,
or
to
enforce
its
orders,
judgments,
or
decrees
against
the
recusant
parties
before
it
would
be
a
disgrace
to
the
legislation
and
a
stigma
upon
the
age
which
invented
it.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
i'm
not--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--i'm
not
certain
that
we
said
that
in
our
brief,
but
if
we
did,
of
course
we
did,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
meant
to
say
that.
i
think
that
the
jurisdiction,
ancillary
jurisdiction,
if
we
take
away
from
a
court
the
power
to
protect
itself
from
the
lawless
invasion
of
others,
we
take
away
the
court,
respect
for
the
court--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--my
answer
to
that
is
that
there
would
be
very
few
cases
in
which
you
would
have
the
facts
that
you
have
here,
as
found
by
the
federal
district
court,
where
the
district
court
found
there
was
a
specific
intent
on
the
part
of
mr.
peacock
to
undermine
and
defeat
this
particular
judgment.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
i
would
take
issues
with
your
honor's
statement
that
there
are
no
authorities
to
support
ancillary--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--all
right.
well,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
them,
the
dewey
case--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--yes,
i--
[laughter]
mr.
j.
kendall
few
i
would
then
cite
swift
&
company
packers
v....
i'm
not
real
good
at
pronouncing
non-english
words,
not
too
good
with
english
words,
sometimes--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--well,
i
think
that
there
are
a
number.
i
think
that
the
krippendorf
case
is,
i
believe,
and
i
think
the
swift
case--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--krippendorf
is
cited
in
a
number
of
our
briefs.
i'm
not
sure
we've
got
it
cited
in
ours,
but
it's
one
of
the
cases
that
is
cited,
and
i
have
it
here,
but
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
have
been
cited
in--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--yes,
sir.
there
were
i
think
about
five
boxes
full
of
cases
that
were
cited.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
well,
i
think
i'm
going
to
receive
some
assistance
on
this
from
our
arguing
amicus
for
the
united
states,
but
i
believe
that--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--in
that
case,
i
will
cite
that
case
back
to
you,
but
i
would
argue
that
it
should
not...
it
should
not,
from
the
perspective
of
respect
for
thou,
federal
courts
be
the
determining
factor
that
the
interference
took
place
before
or
after
the
judgment.
in
all
cases,
it
would
appear
to
us
that
the
court
should
have
the
power
to
protect
itself,
and
particularly
after
the
judgment
has
been
entered.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
going
back
to
the
chief
justice
marshall's
opinions
in
1825
and
coming
forward
to
the
riggs
case,
it
has
been...
always
been
the
rule
as
long
as
the
question
has
been
addressed
here
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
until
the
action
is
satisfied.
there
are
three
ways,
as
have
been
pointed
out
by
amicus,
that
the
question
can
arise.
1.
the
judgment
debtor
may
have
an
asset
that
is
removed
from
his
possession
but
the
title
has
not
been
removed,
and
in
that
case
the
remedy
would
be
to
require
the
person
who
has
the
possession
to
bring
it
back
in.
the
second
case
would
be
where
there
has
been
a
conveyance
where
the
title
has
actually
been
removed,
and
in
that
case
it
would
be
to
bring
that
party
in
and
require...
set
that
transaction
aside,
and
the
third
case,
as
here--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--yes.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
in
those
three
instances
that
i
have
mentioned,
all
of
those,
if
the
purpose
of
those
transactions
is
to
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
then
the
court
to
vindicate
its
authority
and
carry
out
its
decree
would
have
ancillary
jurisdiction--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
i
believe
that
the
swift
&
company
case
is
one
such
case.
the
dewey
case
is
one
in
which
the
parties
bringing
the
suit--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--well,
i
think
i'll
take
issue
with
your
honor's
statement
but
without
being
able
to
specifically
call
your
attention
to
the
case
at
this
particular
time.
i
hope
that
mr.
bress
will
be
able
to
do
so
and
if
not,
perhaps
i
can
get
that
information
to
the
court.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
there
are
many...
there
are
many--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
there
would
be--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--i
think
that
there's
a
very
strong
burden
under
the
applicable
law
here
to
prove
what
we
have
proved
in
this
case,
and
there
are
many
instances
where
a
businessman
who
is
in
control
of
a
corporation
that
is
insolvent
makes
a
transfer
that
is
in...
is
a
good
faith
business
judgment
on
his
part.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
in
the
majority,
the
vast
majority
of
instances,
there
is
going
to
be
a
good
and
sufficient
consideration
flowing
back
to
the
company,
and
if
they
are
in
a
position
to
prove
that,
then
that
would
defeat
the
claim.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
i
think
that
you're
right
to
the
extent
that
the
issue
is
there.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
i
think
my--
mr.
j.
kendall
few
--my
answer
to
that
is
that
it
would
be
much
more
important
that
the
court
have
the
power
to
vindicate
its
judgment
and
to
act
against
those
who
would
lawlessly
undermine
its
judgments
intentionally,
as
was
held
here.
mr.
j.
kendall
few
thank
you
very
much.
