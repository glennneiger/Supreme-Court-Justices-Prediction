mr.
richard
p.
bress
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'll
be
happy
to
address
some
of
the
case
law--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
i
was
about
to
address
that,
and
if
i
might
address
that
in
the
context
of
just
setting
out
our
affirmative
position,
and
i'll
make
it
short.
in
our
view,
the
result
in
this
case
does
not
require
any
sort
of
expansion
or
drawing
of
new
lines.
it
really
flows
from
long-settled
law,
really
from
four
principles.
the
first
principle
is
that
a
court
retains
article
iii
jurisdiction
over
a
case
until
its
judgment
in
that
case
is
satisfied.
the
second
principle
is
that
a
court
has
the
power,
under
the
all
writs
act,
to
enforce
and
prevent
the
frustration
of
its
judgments.
the
third
principle
is
the
court
has
the
power
to
enforce
its
judgments
against
the
party
or
its
privy,
and
the
fourth
principle...
and
this
was
conceded
by
petitioners
in
their
brief
at
pages
36
and
37...
is
that
this
ancillary
jurisdiction
does
not
depend
on
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
facts.
in
fact,
it
predates
that
doctrine
by...
well,
certainly
more
than
50
years.
now,
in
order
not
to
find
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
this
court
would
have
to
depart
from
those
principles,
and
in
our
view
such
a--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
i
would...
first,
i'd
just
like
to
take
issue
with
the
notion
that
that's
the
core
of
an
ancillary
jurisdiction.
that's
the
core
of
pendant
jurisdiction.
ancillary
jurisdiction,
the
original
incarnation
of
it,
was
the
power
of
a
court
to
enforce
by
writ
of
execution
against
the
very
defendant
before
it
the
judgment
that
it
has
obtained.
now,
i
do
have
cases,
though,
that
address
your
question
and
justice
breyer's
question.
one
such
case
would
be
pierce
v.
united
states.
now,
that
case
involved
a
penalty
that
had
been
obtained
against
a
corporation,
a
civil
penalty
that
had
been
obtained
by
the
government
against
a
corporation,
and
the
corporation
had
distributed
the
property
up
to,
or
out
to
its
shareholders,
and
it
was
held
in
that
case
that
it
was
merely
supplemental
or
auxiliary
to
go
after
those
shareholders
to
pay
the
civil
penalty.
another
such
case,
and
this
case
i
must
acknowledge
was
not
cited--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--there's
no
holding
it
had
jurisdiction
in
rem
in
that
case.
the
property
certainly
wasn't
before
the
court.
the
property
was
in
the
hands
of
the
shareholders.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
actually,
peacock
does
have
the
money,
your
honor.
there
was
a
misconception,
i
think,
that
came
up
during
petitioner's
argument.
i
don't
think
you
quite
understood
what
petitioner
was
saying.
petitioner
had...
in
this
case,
peacock.
i'll
use
that
name,
had...
the
allegation
is
that
he
had
taken
the
money
to
himself,
and
there's
some
dispute
as
to
how
much
money
it
is,
but
the
allegation
is
that
he
took
the
money
for
himself,
not
that
he
paid
it
out
to
a
third
party.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
another
case
that
i'd
like
to
bring
up
at
this
point--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
function--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--this
is
not
a
fraudulent
conveyance
case,
your
honor.
this
is
a
case
where
mr.
peacock
is
being
held
liable
because
at
law
he
is
considered
to
be
the--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--no.
because
under
standard
principles
of
law
that
cut
across
many
areas
of
law,
he
is
considered
by
virtue
of
his
actions
and
his
own--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
actually
a
closer
nexus
to
the
underlying
case,
because
for
whatever
reason...
and
it
does
have
to
do
with
wrongdoing,
and
also
how
the
shareholder
has
treated
the
corporation
in
its
relations
to
the
corporation.
the
theory
in
this
case
is
that
the
alter
ego
is
the
corporation
for
purposes
of
law,
and
it's
no
different
in
that
respect,
and
i
think--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--all
right--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--all
right.
your
honor,
this
case
could
have
been
brought
under
pure
fraudulent
conveyance
theory.
it
was
not.
now--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--the
theory
of
this
case
is,
your
honor,
as
i
was
about
to
say,
is
really
indistinguishable
from
collection
of
a
judgment
that
you've
already
obtained
against
a
successor
corporation.
now,
in
some
states...
i'll
grant
that
in
some
states
net
recovery
will
be
limited
to
the
number
of
assets,
or
amount
of
assets
that's
been
transferred
to
the
successor,
but
that
is
not
universally
the
case.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
the
rule
of
law
in
this
instance,
your
honor,
says
that
a
corporate
alter
ego
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
corporation
in
the
same
way
that
a
successor
corporation
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the...
a
successor
corporation
stands
in
the
shoes
of
a
corporation.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
all
right,
first,
your
honor...
and
i
will
answer
that
right
at
this
moment,
but
first,
that
issue
is
not
presented
in
this
case,
because
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
result
would
obtain
either
under
its
federal
common
law
standard
or
under
south
carolina
law.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
it's
our
view
that
it's
south
carolina
law.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
we're
alleging
that
there's
ancillary
jurisdiction.
however,
there
is
discretion...
the
court
retains
discretion
because
execution
is
an
equitable
function
to
hold
back
from
exercising
that
jurisdiction,
and
in
some
of
the
instances,
or
in
some
of
the
examples
that
justice
breyer
suggested,
the
ancillary
cause
of
action
may
become
so
attenuated
from
what
the
federal
court
of
appeals
did
it
primarily
does--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
execution
can
include
not
only,
your
honor,
a
legal
writ,
it
can
include
attachment,
it
can
include
garnishment--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--because,
your
honor,
in
the
cases
of
dunn
v.
clark,
i
believe,
and
also
in
dewey
itself,
the
court
spoke
of
an
exercise
of
equity
in
support
of
collecting
a
legal
judgment,
and
i'd
like
to
address
dewey
before
it
gets
too
late,
because
i
think
there's
been
some
misunderstanding
about
it.
dewey
would
fall
under
pendant
jurisdiction
if
the
claim
was
against...
the
counterclaim
had
been
just
against
the
plaintiff.
however,
joined
with
that
there
is
a
claim
against
a
third
party
defendant
for
fraudulent
conveyance.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
it
was
for
fraudulent
conveyance,
your
honor,
it
really
was,
and
because
of
that,
it
really
is
no
different
than
if
it
had
just
been
a
claim
by
a
plaintiff
where
you
are
joining
a
claim
against
the
person
to
whom
the
fraudulent
conveyance
has
been
made.
the
case
really
can't
be
distinguished
in
that
sense.
as
another
matter
that
i'd
like
to
address--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
here
we're
not
looking
at
what
the
federal
rules
will
permit.
we're
really
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
and
something
quite
important.
i
mean,
this
is
isn't...
you
know--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--this
isn't
an
enlargement
of
federal
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
the
principles
that
i've
stated
up
front
control
this
case.
it's
been
alleged
by
petitioner
that
this
is
an
enlargement.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
we
have,
but
that
is
not
an
enlargement
or
change
in
the
law.
that
has
always
been
the
law,
and
the
court
retains
the
discretion
to
refrain
from
exercising
such
jurisdiction
when
it
becomes
too
attenuated.
