justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
imagine
that
there
are
40,000
cases
in
the
federal
courts
every
year
where
plaintiff
sues
a
defendant
corporation,
and
let's
say
in
20,000
the
plaintiff
obtains
a
money
judgment
against
the
corporation,
and
let's
say
in
3,000
the
corporation
might
be
insolvent.
now,
what
a
plaintiff
does
when
he
has
a
judgment,
he
is
a
judgment
creditor
against
the
corporation,
and
i
imagine
that
there
are
dozens
of
things
that
might
happen
to
that
corporation's
property.
it
might
go
into
bankruptcy
court.
an
officer
may
decide
to
pay
himself.
an
officer
may
decide
to
pay
another
debt.
to
my
knowledge,
those
vast
matters
of
state
law,
sometimes
federal
preferences,
sometimes
fraudulent
conveyances,
sometimes
violations
of
other
duties
of
officers
to
corporations,
to
my
knowledge
those
matters
have
not
become
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction
except
in
the
bankruptcy
courts,
where
they
should
be.
i
haven't
found
a
case
to
the
contrary,
and
i
don't
see
how
by
accepting
this
case
and
agreeing
with
you
i
could
avoid
bringing
into
federal
court
the
thousands
of
state
law
cases
that
involve
the
rights
of
judgment
creditors
against
the
corporate
officers
or
other
third
parties,
so
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
always...
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
i
take
it,
is
a
case
where
a
creditor
has
a
claim
against
a
corporation
or
a
person,
and
that
person
or
the
officer
decides
to
prefer
his
friends
or
his
family
to
the
rightful
creditor.
now,
how
would
you
distinguish
that...
and
indeed,
this
is
a
perfect
example.
you
bring
a
thing
called
a
veil-piercing
cause
of
action.
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
didn't
say
there
weren't.
i
said
i
hadn't
found
any,
which
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
dewey
case
is
a
case
which
would
be
ancillary
today.
it
was
absolute
common
nucleus
of
fact.
a
sues
b
for
judgment
on
a
contract.
b
replies
saying
your
coal
was
no
good
and
give
me
damages
from
what
you
already
delivered.
they
want
to
bring
into
it,
that
case,
the
company
that
was
the
successor
company.
he's
rationalizing
it,
mr.
few.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
ones
that
i
want,
exactly
that,
because
the
ones
you
think...
i
haven't
read
the
swift
one.
i
did
read
quite
a
few
of
the
ones
that
were
cited,
but
not
all
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no...
i
mean,
probably
if
you
had
one
you'd
say
look,
here
are
the
facts
right
here,
and
the
one
that
seems
a
most
likely
cite
are
ones
which
seem
fairly
readily
distinguishable,
at
least
to
me,
so
the
one
that's
the
best
for
you
is
which?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
empire
was
the
best
actually,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
and
empire
seemed
to
be
one
in
which
judge
hand
was
going
on
the
peculiar
fact
of
new
york
law
that
they
treated
a
fraudulent
conveyance
as
if
it
was
something
they
called
an
equitable
execution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
my
concern,
which
i'll
go
back
to
for
a
second,
is
a
totally
practical
one.
it
could
federalize
state
fraudulent
conveyance
law
in
terms
of
giving
courts
jurisdiction
to
enforce
it.
you
could
do
the
same
thing
about
breaches
of
obligation
of
corporations
in
this
area,
et
cetera.
you
have
done
it
when
you
go
into
bankruptcy
court,
and
since
you
have
that
remedy
in
bankruptcy
court,
which
you
can
use
if
you
want,
i
was
awfully
nervous
about
a
holding
that
would
federalize
the
rest
of
it,
and
that's
why
i...
that's
why
i
raise
this.
i
want
to
get
your
response.
it's
not
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well
then,
what
about...
i'm
worried
as
well...
you
see,
workers.
i
mean,
suppliers.
there
are
thousands
of
people
all
over
the
country
who
might
get
some
money.
they
might
just
be
employees
of
the
company.
they
suddenly
end
up
with
some
money
from
the
company,
and
then,
leaving
this
case
aside,
a
judgment
creditor
could
suddenly
haul
those
people
into
federal
court
in
some
place
and
all
of
a
sudden
they'd
be
adjudicating
the
law
of
fraudulent
conveyances
and
all
these
other
things.
that's
the
underlying
concern
that
i
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
answer
to
that
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
the
problem
that
i've
had
with
the
briefs
on
this
side.
there
is
no
such
thing,
to
my
knowledge,
as
a
cause
of
action
called
piercing
the
corporate
veil.
that's
just
what
justice
scalia
said.
this
case
does
not
lie
on
the
principle
that
mr.
peacock
was
the
alter
ego
of
the
corporation
for
purposes
of
violating
erisa,
so
what
you
have
here
is,
you
have
a
valid
judgment
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
peacock.
now
you're
trying
to
enforce
the
judgment.
at
that
point,
you
don't
need
the
corporate
veil
theory.
or
maybe
you
do,
or
maybe
you
don't,
but
the
question
is,
what
is
it
that
either
the
corporation
or
mr.
peacock
did
wrong,
and
i
take
it
what's
wrong
is
that
they
transferred
some
assets
to
a
person
who
didn't
deserve
them
as
much
as
did
the
judgment
creditor.
now,
if
that
isn't
the
case,
i
don't
understand
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
if
it
is
the
case,
i
don't
understand
how
the
cases
you
cite
are
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
what
was
the
theory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
principle
of
law
that
allows
a
person
who
holds
a
judgment
against
jones
to
collect
it
against
smith
in
the
absence
of
some
kind
of
rule
of
law
that
says,
what,
like
a
fraudulent
conveyance
or
some
other
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wasn't
it
more
than
that?
it
was
for,
in
fact,
having
this
coal
that
didn't
live
up
to
the
standards.
