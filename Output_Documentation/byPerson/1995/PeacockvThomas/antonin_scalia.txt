justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
decided
it
against
you
we
could
dodge
the
other
bullet,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
great.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
off
of
the
remand
necessity
to
determine
personal
jurisdiction,
why
do
you
reject
out
of
hand
the
possibility
that
in
a
suit
that
is
ancillary
to
another
suit,
the
court's
personal
jurisdiction
is
the
same
as
that
in
the
suit
to
which
the
suit
is
ancillary?
that
is,
even
if
this
doesn't...
even
if
this
is
not
an
erisa
case,
if
it
is
ancillary
to
a
case
in
which
there
is
nationwide
jurisdiction,
there
is
also
nationwide
jurisdiction
in
the
ancillary
suit.
isn't
that
a
possibility?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
isn't
that
something
we
ought
to
look
at?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
to
some
extent
you
can't
claim
that
no
new
issues
must
be
triable.
for
example,
in
the
county
commissioners
case,
where
there's
a
judgment
against
the
county
and
the
order
going
to
the
commissioners,
the
commissioners
could
raise,
for
example,
as
we've
had
them
raise
here,
a
constitutional
objection
that
the
court
cannot
require
them
to
impose
a
tax,
or
things
of
that
sort.
they
can
raise
issues,
can't
they,
even
though
it's
ancillary,
legal
issues
that
are
separate
and
distinct,
and
in
addition
to
the
legal
issues
raised
in
the
original
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
principle
of
the
first
lawsuit
governs,
the
county
is
liable,
okay,
for
this
money.
the
county
doesn't
have
the
money,
so
you
get
an
order
to
the
commissioners
telling
them
to
impose
the
tax.
the
commissioners
come
in,
and
they
want
to
argue
the
court
has
no
power
to
direct
the
imposition
of
a
tax.
we've
had
people
argue
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
better
off
rationalizing
dewey.
[laughter]
it
did
involve
a
common
nucleus
of
facts,
after
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
freeman,
before
you
go
on,
i
mean,
the
line
you
propose
is
one
point
at
which
i
suppose
we
could
draw
the
line.
if
you
have
to
go
beyond
what
was
adjudged
in
the
original
case
and
adjudge
new
tort
liability,
it's
not
ancillary.
but
we
could
also
adopt
another
line,
and
that
is
anything,
whether
by
tort
or
not,
that
interferes
with
the
satisfaction
of
the
original
judgment
is
ancillary.
now,
what...
you
know,
what's
wrong
with
choosing
the
latter
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
horribles
that
would
entail?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
really
the
opinion
for
the
court.
i
just
happened
to
write
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
few,
let
me
ask
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
would
it
be
that
someone
who
derives
a
fraudulent
conveyance
from
an
insolvent
company
which
numbers
among
its
debts
some
judicial
judgments,
when
would
it
be
that
such
a
person
would
not
have
an
intent
to
frustrate
the
court's
judgment?
wouldn't
that
always
be
the
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whenever
there's
a
fraudulent
conveyance
of
a
bankrupt
who
has
a
judgment
against
them,
which
most
bankrupts
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
it
always
be
not
only...
not
only
allegeable,
but
wouldn't
it
always
be
true?
you
know,
when
you
accept
a
fraudulent...
you're
frustrating
all
of
the
creditors,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what
does
it
take
to
prove
it?
it
seems
to
me
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
the
fraudulent
transferee,
did
you
know
this
corporation
had
outstanding
judgments
against
it?
yes,
i
did.
and
in
taking
that
fraudulent
transfer,
didn't
you...
didn't
you
intend
to
take
the
money
for
your
own
use
and
deprive
all
of
the
creditors
of
the
corporation,
including
these
judgment
creditors?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true.
i'm
just
saying,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
fraudulent
conveyances
are
really
sucked
into
this
thing,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
did
the
court
have
jurisdiction
in
rem
in
that
case,
or
was
it
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
claim
for
more
money
that
the
corporation
had
at
the
time
of
the
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
he
has
committed
a
tort.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
virtue
of
his
actions.
you
can
call
it
not
a
tort,
but
in
fact
the
veil
will
not
be
pierced,
as
we
say,
unless
he
has
acted
wrongfully,
and
that
distinguishes
the
case
you
just
mentioned,
where
these
individuals
who
had
received
the
payout
from
the
corporation,
the
money
was
returnable
whether
or
not
they
had
acted
wrongfully
in
receiving
it.
the
court
was
sort
of
following
the
res.
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
the
outcome
of
the
case,
but
it
differs
from
a
case
in
which
you
have
to
demonstrate
some
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
those
shareholders.
