justice
clarence
thomas
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
successful
plaintiff
is
left
to
ask
what
happened
to
my
money.
in
1987,
jack
thomas,
no
relation,
filed
an
erisa
class
action
in
federal
court
against
tru-tech,
inc,
his
former
employer
and
d.
grant
peacock,
an
officer
and
shareholder
of
tru-tech.
for
the
benefits
due
under
the
corporation's
pension
benefits
plan.
he
won
the
suit
against
tru-tech
but
lost
against
peacock.
thomas
did
not
collect
the
judgment
while
the
case
was
on
appeal
and
peacock
apparently
settled
many
of
tru-tech's
accounts
with
favored
creditors
not
a
lease
of
whom
was
himself.
after
the
appeal,
thomas
was
unable
to
collect
the
judgment
from
tru-tech
there
being
no
money,
so
he
filed
a
new
lawsuit
against
peacock
in
federal
court
arguing
among
other
things
that
the
court
should
pierce
the
corporate
veil
and
hold
peacock
personally
liable
for
the
judgment
that
thomas
had
won
against
tru-tech.
the
district
court
agreed
with
thomas
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
took
this
case
decide
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
over
thomas'
second
lawsuit.
we
hold
that
it
did
not.
because
thomas
allege
no
violation
of
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
codiac
or
of
tru-tech's
long
sense
terminated
plan,
and
because
the
erisa
recognizes
no
stand
along
cause
of
action
for
piercing
the
corporate
veil,
neither
erisa’s
jurisdictional
provision
nor
the
general
federal
question
statute
supply
the
district
court
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
suit.
we
also
disagree
with
thomas’
argument
that
this
action
is
sufficiently
related
or
ancillary
to
his
original
lawsuit.
though
we
have
approved
the
exercise
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
a
broad
range
of
supplementary
proceedings
involving
third
parties
to
assist
in
protection
and
enforcement
of
federal
judgment,
we
have
never
authorized
the
exercise
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
a
subsequent
lawsuit
to
transfer
liability
for
an
existing
federal
judgment
to
a
person
not
already
liable
for
that
judgment.
as
long
as
the
federal
rules
protect
the
judgment
creditor's
ability
to
execute
on
a
judgment,
the
district
court's
authority
is
adequately
preserved.
an
ancillary
jurisdiction
is
not
justified
over
a
new
lawsuit
to
impose
liability
for
judgment
on
a
third
party.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
