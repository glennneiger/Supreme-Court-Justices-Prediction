we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-1453,
d.
grant
peacock
v.
jack
thomas.
mr.
freeman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
were
to
decide
the
second
question
in
your
favor,
would
we
need
to
reach
the
first
question,
mr.
freeman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
freeman,
in
the
dewey
case,
which
respondents
rely
on,
it
was
to
set
aside
a
fraudulent
conveyance.
now,
you're
always...
in
a
fraudulent
conveyance
case
you're
always
going
to
have
this
question
of
the
motive
of
the
defendant,
did
they
convey
the
property,
and
can
you
infer
from
the
price
that
it
was
fraudulent,
things
that
weren't
litigated
in
the
first
lawsuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
case
was
decided
long
before
the
common
nucleus
phrase
was
even
developed,
and
it
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
ancillary
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
it
perfectly
rational
the
way
it
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
freeman.
mr.
few,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
our
rules,
mr.
few,
are
that
amicus
may
not
inject
a
separate
issue
into
the
case
that
has
not
been
raised
by
the
parties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
justice
scalia's
the
prevailing
one
in
kokkonen?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
few.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bress,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
do
you
say
execution
is
an
equitable
function?
i
never
understood...
there
are
equitable
remedies
for
collecting
debts,
but
i'd
understood
execution
is
just
a
very
straightforward
issuance
of
a
legal
writ.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
both
another
prototypical
examples
of
writs...
garnishment,
execution,
attachment.
why
do
you
say
they're
equitable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bress.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94-1453,
peacock
against
thomas
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
