mr.
david
l.
freeman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
are
two
important
areas
of
the
law,
one
touching
on
erisa,
the
other
dealing
with
the
scope
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
in
the
erisa
issue,
we
ask
the
court
to
examine
whether
there
exists
a
federal
common
law
remedy
of
veil-piercing
or
a
rule
of
decision
said
by
the
courts
below
to
arise
out
of
erisa.
the
issue
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
seeks
examination
by
the
court
of
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
entertain
a
separate
lawsuit,
such
as
the
case
now
before
the
court,
where
there
is
no
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction.
the
case
before
the
court
was
commenced
3
years
after
a
judgment
was
entered
against
tru-tech.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
your
honor,
you
would
not,
i
think...
the
second
question
being
the
ancillary
jurisdiction--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--question?
well,
i
think
i
spoke
too
quickly
there.
i
believe
that
you
would
in
fact
need
to
go
back
to
the
erisa
issue
and
make
a
decision
on
whether
you
can
read
into
erisa
a
common
law
cause
of
action,
and
that
would
be
the
federal
question
basis
for
maintaining
this
action
in
federal
court.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
that's
the
way
to
put
it.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
yes...
that's
the
right
way
to
put
it.
so...
but
i
understand
the
complexity
of
the
ancillary
jurisdiction,
and
it
would
be
my
purpose,
unless
the
court
should
direct
me
otherwise,
to
address
that
first
and
then
in
the
time
remaining
come
back,
if
i
may,
to
erisa.
in
the
second
suit
before
the
court,
the
district
court,
after
trial
on
the
merits,
held
the
petitioner
liable
for
the
tru-tech
judgment
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
federal
law
cause
of
action.
now,
when
it
reached
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
without
hearing
argument,
really
without
the
briefs
having
addressed
the
issue,
found
that
the
jurisdiction
giving
vitality
to
the
case
was
to
be
found
in
the
court's
ancillary
jurisdiction,
and
we
believe
that
in
so
doing
that
constituted
a
mistake
which
needs
to
be
addressed
in
the
court
here
today.
before
moving
away
from
the
subject
of
erisa,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
want
to
make
one
important
point.
the
district
court
asserted
personal
jurisdiction
over
petitioner,
a
resident
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
on
the
basis
of
erisa's
provision
for
nationwide
service
of
process.
now,
should
this
court
conclude
that
there
is
no
erisa
cause
of
action
to
be
read
into
the
erisa
statute,
we
believe
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
at
a
minimum
to
remand
for
a
proper
determination
of
personal--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--we
do
have
a
long
arm
statute,
your
honor,
and
the...
i
don't
think
it's
terribly
clear
that
if
you
have
erisa
jurisdiction
that
furnishes
a
substitute
for
appropriate
service
of
process.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
he
would
have
been
subject
to
the
long
arm
statute,
and
when
we
attack
the
subject
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
and
we
have
to
determine
under
the
argument
of
the
government
which
law
applies,
then
it
would
make
a
difference
what
law
is
applied,
and
if,
for
example,
you
should
apply
the
law
of
fraudulent
transfers,
then
you
would
be
thrown
to
a
focus
which
shifts
in
point
of
time
from
south
carolina
to
pennsylvania,
where
all
of
the
actions
which
were
involved
in
that
occurred.
and
i
would
submit,
i
think,
at
the
time
of
remand,
that
the
appropriate
place
for
trial
would
be
pennsylvania,
and
that
the
long
arm
statute,
while
it
might
reach
causes
of
action
in
south
carolina,
would
not
be
sufficient
without
sufficient
constitutional--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--cannot.
cannot.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
precisely.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i
don't
know
what--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--i
think
it
would
have
to
be
looked
at,
and
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is.
i
think
you
would
be
required
to
take
a
close
focus
on
what
nationwide
service
of
process
relates
to,
and
under
the
statute
it
relates,
really,
to
actions
under
erisa,
so
if
you
can
read
a
cause
of
action
into
erisa...
probably.
but
if
you're
only
reading
a
rule
of
decision
into
erisa,
if
you're
superimposing
it
at
that
level,
i
think
it's
very
problematical
that
you
can
read
the
nationwide
service
of
process
statute
in
a
way
that
would
effectuate
personal
jurisdiction
under
the
nationwide
service.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i'm
sure
he
was.
my
memory
doesn't
go
entirely
to
that
point,
but
there
was
no
question
of
his
jurisdiction
at
that
point.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i
think
that's
the...
a
critical
question
for
me
to
deal
with,
and
what
i
want
to
say
about
that
is...
i'll
come
back
to
it
a
number
of
times,
but
basically
that
supposes
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
court's
order
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
not,
as
we
maintained,
the
violation
of
a
state
court
rule
of
law,
and--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--pardon?
mr.
david
l.
freeman
to
say
that
this
person
should
be
held
liable
in
an
action
which
seeks
affirmative
relief
against
him,
personal
liability,
and
that
you
append
that
to
the
first
action
on
ancillary
jurisdiction
simply
because
he
had
an
eye
to
that
judgment
in
doing
what
he
did,
we
think
goes
farther
than
this
court's
decisions
has
ever
gone
in
creating
ancillary
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
they
had
not,
but
the
commissioners--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--peacock.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
not
at
all,
and
fundamentally
in
a
different
position.
the
commissioners
in
labette
were
simply
the
people
who
could
bring
about
satisfaction
of
that
judgment.
they
were
representatives
of
a
public
body,
the
entity,
and
in
so
doing,
the
directive
to
them
was
merely
the
means
of
executing
on
the
judgment,
and
probably
the
only
means
that
could
be
effectuated,
whereas--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--whereas
in
contrast
here,
what's
sought
is
not
that,
but
he
is
being
required
personally,
not
in
his
representative
capacity...
he
is
being
required
to
respond
in
a
money
judgment
in
court
in
a
summary
fashion,
rather
than--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--i
don't
think
that's
the
difference.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i'm--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--i'm
not
sure
of
that
at
all.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
what
i
am
sure
of
is
that
the
court
in
labette
and
the
court
in
riggs,
which
is
its
first
cousin
and
one
that
the
lower
court
here
relied
upon,
both
treated
the
mandamus,
the
writ
of
mandamus
there
as
the
substitute
for
a
writ
of
execution,
and
in
so
doing
they
directed
the
people
who
had
the
ability
to
require...
to
satisfy
the
original
order
to
take
that
appropriate
action,
and
they
did
not
seek
of
them
any
affirmative
release
or
seek
to
hold
them
personally
liable--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--that
appropriate
action
would
have
been,
i
suppose,
in
that
case
to
have
required
them
personally
to
respond
in
satisfaction
of
the
court's
order.
what
we
believe
is
involved
here--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--no,
i
don't
think
that
was
ever
contemplated
in
labette
or
in
riggs.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
in
fact,
they
were
being
directed
to
levy
the
tax
to
satisfy
the
bond.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
right.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
right--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--and
we
believe
that
that
simply--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--treating
him
somehow
as
amenable
to
mandamus--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--as
if
he
were
a
public
figure.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i
think
that
would
involve
precisely
the
same
thing,
that
what
you're
doing
is
departing
from
principles
of
res
judicata,
and
simply
establishing
affirmative
liability,
personal
liability,
if
you
will,
in
a
way
that
this
court
has
not
yet--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--bring
a
suit
against
yourself...
to
recover
the--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--i
think
you
would,
at
most
what
could
be
done
with
respect
to
mr.
peacock...
he
had
been
the
unpaid
chairman
of
this
board
for
a
long
while...
would
be
to
require
tru-tech,
with
orders
directed
against
him
as
the
only
person
who
could
respond
to
it,
to
cause
tru-tech
to
pay
the
money
back.
now--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--of
course,
there
would
need
to
be
two
sides
to
that
lawsuit,
obviously,
and
you
wouldn't
ask
peacock
to
recover
the
money
from
himself.
it
would
be
an
appropriate
point,
i
think,
had
the
respondent
chosen
to
do
it,
to
invoke
involuntary
bankruptcy
once
he
had
his
judgment,
which
would
have
been
a
mechanism
under
which
the
estate
of
the
bankrupt
tru-tech
could
be
placed
in
the
court's
in
rem
jurisdiction.
that's
the
other
line
of
cases.
attachment
is
the
prime
example,
and
i
suppose
levy
under
the
writ
of
execution
in
both
the--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--fraudulently
transferred
it
to
peacock.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
he
may
or
may
not
still
have
it.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
can
he
be
made
amenable
under
a
writ
of
execution
for
the
restoration
of
that,
for
under
fraudulent
conveyance
it's
part
of
ancillary
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i
would
say
no,
and
i
would
say
no
because
there
what
you
are
seeking
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
to
fix
liability
on
a
stranger,
stranger
in
the
eyes
of
the
law,
to
the
original
judgment,
and
for
that
there
would
need
to
be
a
full-blown
trial,
going
through
to
the
end
on
the
merits,
and
the
adjudication
of
his
personal...
of
transferee's
personal
responsibility,
not
the
government
situs.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
that
would
be
in
the
areas
where
they
are
not
bound
by
the
principles
of
determining
the
first
lawsuit.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
well,
they
certainly
could
not--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--they
could
not
relitigate
the
issues
determined,
and
i
haven't
given
particular
thought
to
the
issues
that
they
might
raise
outside
the
ambit,
if
you
will,
of
the
original
adjudication.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
right,
and
let
me
say
this
about
dewey:
dewey
is
a
totally
different
situation
from
the
one
we
have
here,
in
that
it
came
up
from
the
defendant's
side
of
the
table
in
the
form
of
a
compulsory
counterclaim
to
the
contractual
issue
before
the
court,
and
there,
in
addition
to
the
contractual
counterclaim,
there
was
a
claim
by
the
defendant,
a
counterclaim
by
the
defendant
to
set
aside
as
a
fraudulent
conveyance
a
transfer
from
the
plaintiff
to
an
affiliate
corporation,
and
we
analyze
that
case
as
one
in
which
there
is
a
common
nucleus
of
issues--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--it
was.
it
was,
and
we
think
it
has
to
be
rationalized
on
the
common
nucleus
basis--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--without
being
rationalized?
mr.
david
l.
freeman
well,
i--
[laughter]
well,
i
think
there
is
some
argument
for
that.
if
you
look
at
owen,
you
see
that
defendants
can
do
things
that
plaintiffs
cannot
do,
and
owen
says
it's
the
posture
of
the
thing
that's
of
great
importance,
and
that
defendants,
who
are
hailed
into
court,
if
you
will,
stand
at
risk
of
losing
the
adjudication
of
their
claims
unless
they're
given
some
broader
latitude
to
raise
the
issues
and
have
them
adjudicated.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
it
was,
and--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--i
believe
that
we
can
draw
the
line
under
owens
that
would
say
that
the
plaintiff,
at
least,
would
not
be
able
to
join--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--right,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
saying
in
owens
when
it
said
the
posture
of
things
is
crucial,
and
they
went
on
to
talk--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--it
did,
and
i
remember
that
your
honor
struggled
with
that
somewhat
in
a
footnote
to,
i
believe,
finley.
i'm
always
cautious
in
arguing
cases
when
i
know
the
justices
have
struggled
with
it
themselves.
i
struggled
with
it,
but
i
don't
think
at
the
end
of
the
day
dewey
is
decisive
of
our
situation.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
it
involved
a
nondiverse
party
in
the
affiliate
that
was
joined,
i
believe.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
in
the
course
of
the
trial?
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i
think
at
least
in
south
carolina
and
probably
around
the
world
there
are
procedures
for
attachment
prior
to
judgment,
and
that
that
would
be
a
mechanism
to
be
employed
that
would
bring
the
assets
within
the--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--i
would
resist
that
with
all
fervor,
not
that
my
resistance
has
always
carried
the
day,
as
this
court
knows,
but
what
would
be
happening
there
is
that
there
would
be
an
injunction
doing
what
an
attachment
might
do,
but
an
attachment
would
do
it
only
in
the
setting
of
an
ample
bond
to
protect
the
improvident
issuance,
and
the
simple
issuance
of
a
restraining
order
or
an
injunction
in
the
course
of
a
trial
before
it's
final
determination
would,
i
think,
prejudge
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case,
and--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--if
the
court
did
it
without
bond,
would
be
a
problem
that
i
would
have.
i
think
the
court
has
that
power,
and
once
it
effectuates
that
power,
then
it
has
the
property
within
the
custody
of
the
court,
actual
or
constructive,
so
i
don't
challenge
the
court's
power.
i
challenge
the
method
of
execution
with
the
use
of
the
power
without
security
standards
being
imposed,
and
once
it's
exercised,
then
as
i
see
it,
it
turns
the
case
to
the
extent
of
the
assets
into
an
in
rem
proceedings,
which
is
different.
i
think
the
government
in--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--well,
the
court
could
draw
such
a
line,
i
suppose,
but
what
it
would
be
doing
is
drawing
a
line
that
i
think
would
be
very
difficult
of
effectuating.
it
would--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--the
litany
of
horrors,
as
we've
tried
to
visualize
it,
is
that
you
would
simply
be
saying
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
a
thing
to
be
determined
focusing
on
intent
or
purpose,
and
the
person
who
has
the
intent
to
defeat
or
frustrate
a
federal
judgment
is
somebody
who
ought,
with
nothing
more,
to
be
hailed
into
federal
court
under
ancillary
jurisdiction
and
required
to
respond.
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
something
to
be
determined
at
the
outset
of
a
case
before
you
go
forward,
because
it
cannot
be
waived,
and
if
it
turns,
and
traditionally
it's
turned
on
objective
considerations
instead
of
subjective
ones...
do
you
have
diverse
parties?
is
there
the
sufficient
amount
for
jurisdiction?
is
there
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
fact
+/?
those
things
can
be
determined
at
the
threshold
of
the
litigation,
and
then
you
go
forward.
if
you've
changed
the
rules
of
the
game
to
say
that
we're
going
to
let
this
ride
on
a
determination
of
intent,
then
you
have
given...
you
have
opened
the
door,
as
we
see
it,
to
a
simple
allegation...
there's
room
for
hyperbole
in
every
complaint...
that
alleges
that
the
defendant
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
the
payment
of
this
judgment
secreted
or
transferred
the
assets.
those
are
relevant
inquiries
in
the
state
court
claim,
but
once
they're
allowed
to
determine
the
issue
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
you
have
created,
as
we
see
it,
something
that
can
be
raised
years
later,
established
on
the
basis
of
complaints
requiring
in
fact
a
subjective
determination
that
only
comes
at
the
end
of
the
day
in
the
lawsuit,
and
permitting,
i
believe,
a
widening
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
that
will
trouble
it
for
years
to
come.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i
don't
think
that
ancillary
jurisdiction
should
be
extended
as
far
as
it
was
sought
to
be
extended
here.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
yes.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
yes,
that's
what
we
said.
the
one
case
that
comes
close
to
that
is
the
empire
lighting
case
which
our
friends
at
the
other
table
have
cited.
that's
a
judge
learned
hand
decision,
and
i'm
always
careful
to...
with
tremendous
deference
for
judge
hand.
that
case,
however,
turns
on
a
peculiarity
of
new
york
law,
and
was
so
recognized
by
judge
hand
in
his
decision.
what
he
said
was
that
under
new
york
law
the
fraudulent
transfer
is
absolutely
void,
and
that
the
transferee
is
really
not
a
necessary
party
to
the
adjudication
of
that
matter,
and
that
what
was
working
in
empire
lighting
was
an
equitable
execution
against
the
assets
still
deemed
in
the
law
to
be
owned
by
the
transferor,
and
it's
been
treated
as...
it's
been
rationalized
on
that
distinction
by
later
decisions
cited
in
our
briefs.
i
will
reserve,
if
i
may,
the
remainder
of
my
time.
