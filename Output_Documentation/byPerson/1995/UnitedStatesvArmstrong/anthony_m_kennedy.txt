justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
aid
of
justice
breyer's
question,
suppose...
what
happened
before
rule
16
was
on
the
books?
what
was...
what
is
the
authority
or
the
source
of
law
for
the
court
ever
to
order
discovery?
is
it
the
inherent
powers
of
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
only
in
a
constitutional
case
can
a
court
ever
order
discovery?
before
rule
16
came
onto
the
scene,
because
if
we
knew
that,
then
we'd
know
whether
or
not
rule
16
was
designed
to
contain
the
entire
authority
for
the
courts
to
order
discovery,
or
whether
or
not
there's
some
inherent
authority,
or
something
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
has
a
constitutional
basis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
a
request
for
a
list,
where
the
government
has
to
compile
a
separate
list,
the
same
as
a
request
for
documents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
may
not
have
been
under
rule
16(c).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
comment
on
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
the
burke
study
shows
that
this
information
was
in
fact
available?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
was
done
by
the
defense,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
burkes
memorandum
was
prepared
by
and
submitted
by
the
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
your
claim
was
the
disparity
between
state
and
federal
prosecutions,
because
the
federal
prosecutions
involve
the
higher
penalty,
and
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
even
under
the
burke
study,
3
percent
of
42
defendants
is
1
defendant.
that
universe
is
completely
insubstantial
as
a
showing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
is
correct
that
you
were
comparing
state
prosecutions
and
federal
prosecutions.
that
was
your
point,
was
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it,
just
for...
justice
ginsburg's
point
is
that
the
backdrop
that
you
refer
to
has
a
premise
which
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
yours--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
the
sentencing
commission
is
wrong
in
its
suggestion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
24
include
these
defendants?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
were
all
related,
and
then
how
many
defendants
were
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
also
had
in
common
that
they
knew
each
other
and
they
were
in
the
same
conspiracy.
i
take
it
that
was
also
a
common--
