ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
the
district
court's
order
for
limited
discovery
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed
for
several
reasons.
first...
and
we
agree
with
much
of
what
solicitor
general
days
has
said.
we
agree
that
rule
16
applies
to
this
case.
the
request
made
at
the
district
court
level
was
for
specific
documents.
those
documents
were
found
by
the
district
judge
to
be
relevant
and
material
under
rule
16,
and
we
believe
the
district
court
applied
the
appropriate
standard
and
applied
the
appropriate
considerations
in
determining--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
but--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--i
think,
as
the
court
has
suggested
in
argument,
discovery
is
a
step-by-step
process.
this
was
the
preliminary
step
that
we
took
toward
the
end
of
meeting
the
burden
of...
to--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--well--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--we
disagree
with
that
position.
i
think
selective
prosecution
is
a
defense,
and
is
encompassed
by
the
phrase,
defense,
in
rule
16.
there's
certainly
nothing
to
exclude
it
from
application
of
the
rule.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
selective
prosecution
doesn't
go
to
the
traditional
notion
of
guilt
or
innocence,
as
i
believe
you're
suggesting--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--mr.
chief
justice.
nevertheless,
it
is
a
defense
in
the
sense
it,
if
proven,
results
in
nonconviction.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
that
would
be
the
ultimate
result
were
we
able
to
put
forward
sufficient
evidence
at
that
level.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
dismissal
would
be
the
appropriate
remedy
for
a
constitutional
violation
based
on
race.
certainly
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
immediately
this
is
the
most
serious
kind
of
a
claim
that
a
defendant
can
raise,
and
that
is
racial
selectivity.
based
on
that
claim,
the
district
judge
ordered
very
limited
information,
which
we
do
believe
is
encompassed
by
rule
16,
and
we
believe
that
the
standards,
the
traditional
standards
that
apply
to
rule
16
requests,
apply
in
this
case,
and
no
higher
standard
should
be
set
because
we
are
making
a
claim
of
possible
racial
selectivity.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--i
understand
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
and
while
we
never
mention
rule
16,
it
was
clear
we
were
asking
for
documents,
it's
clear
the
documents
are
contained
in
rule
16.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
believe
that
those
documents
would
be
covered
by
rule
16.
certainly
we
don't
know
if
the
documents
were
in
the
government's
possession
because
the
government
chose
to
not
comply
with
the
order.
the
government
never
suggested
they
didn't
have
possession
of
the
documents,
or--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--what
i
would
anticipate,
and
what
i
would
have
anticipated
at
the
time
in
early
1992,
was
that
the
government
would
proffer
that
objection
to
the
request
and
say
we
don't
have
these
documents
and
we
can't
be
compelled
to
create
a
summary
based
on
your
request.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
think
that
the
answer
would
be
the
government
cannot
be
compelled
to
create
a
document
under
rule
16.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
the
district
court--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--at
the
time
of
its
order
was
in
possession
of
the
limited
survey
to
which
you
reference.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
and
that
was
all
at
the
initial
hearing.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
the
final
order
was
issued
in
december.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
at
the
time
of
the
initial
order.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
do
think
it
was
sufficient,
and
i
also
believe
the
record
reflects
that
the
district
judge
was
relying
to
some
extent
on
her
own
experience,
as
district
judges
do
when
presented
with
discovery
requests.
this
judge,
having
been
in
the
central
district
of
california
for
a
number
of
years
and
previously
having
been
a
state
court
judge,
would
know
whether
we
had
access
to
the
documents
requested,
would
bring
her
own
experience
to
the
discovery
order.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
well,
certainly
we
wouldn't
expect
a
district
judge
to
proffer
her
own
evidence
in
support
of
the
motion.
nevertheless,
when
district
judges
make
discovery
orders
and
consider
requests
by
defendants,
i
think
they
rely
on
their
experience,
and
that's
part
of
the
reason
that
this
court
and
the
appellate
courts
offer
discretion
to
the
trial
judge--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--i
think
that
common
sense
tells
us
that
district
judges
rely
on
their
own--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--yes.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
think
it
would
be
correct,
and
i
think
this
district
judge,
in
framing
the
order,
recognized
and
mentioned
that
a
number
of
these
type
of
cases
had
come
through
the
central
district
of
california.
this
is
something
that
would
be
within
her
particularized
knowledge,
not
apparent
to
an
appellate
court
reviewing
the
decision.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
had
we
been
ordered
to
find
one,
perhaps
we
could
have
gone
out--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--the
information
that
you
are
referencing
is
not
easily
accessible,
and
in
many
instances
is
not
accessible
at
all.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
at
the
time
that
we
raised
the
motion,
we
were
not
limiting
our
claim
solely
to
the
possibilities
among
crack
defendants.
in
fact,
we
were
talking
about
patterns.
we
presented
a
pattern
to
the
district
judge.
we
were
never
under
the
impression
that
had
we
come
in
with
one
white
crack
defendant--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--number
1,
we
disagree
that
that's
required
in
order
to
obtain
discovery.
but
number
2,
the
more
practical
question
that
you
pose,
justice
breyer,
we
did
make
some
efforts
to
obtain
that
information,
and
again,
i
have
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
local
circumstances
in
los
angeles
were
important
considerations,
and
something
that
again
requires
deference
to
the
district
judge.
los
angeles,
the
central
district
of
california
encompasses
a
huge
geographical
area.
the
state
court
system
is
broken
up
into
many,
many
different
courts.
in
fact,
there
is
no
centralized
record-keeper
of
crack
and
powder
cases,
for
example,
and
the
information
is
not
accessible
to
defendants
with
ease,
and
in
some
instances
is
not
accessible
at
all.
for
example,
our
request
for
the
government's
charging
criteria
is
solely
within
the
possession
and
knowledge--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--the
burke
study
was
conducted
over
a
period
of
time
that
encompassed,
i
believe,
more
than
a
year.
the
district
judge
in
that
case
ordered
payment
for
a
paralegal
to
compile
information.
the
attorneys
were
paid
by
the
court
to
collect
the
information.
certainly
that
took--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--pardon
me?
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
that's
correct,
although
ordered
by
the
district
judge
in
the
context
of
an
ongoing
discovery
dispute
and
resolution
of
the
request.
because
the
burke
study
came
into
existence,
however,
i
don't
think
means
that
the
discovery
order
in
this
case
was
improperly
granted.
i
think
the
district
judge
must
have
the
discretion
to
order
levels
of
discovery,
and
perhaps
had
the
district
judge
been
presented
with
the
information
that
we
requested,
that
might
have
been
the
end
of
the
issue
completely.
this
is
one
reason
why
we
suggest
that
solicitor
general
days'
substantial
threshold
showing
is
inappropriate,
and
that
the
district
judge
must
have
the
discretion
to
order
limited
discovery
along
the
way,
perhaps
moving
towards
an
easy
and
quick
resolution
of
the
matter
rather
than
wait
18
months
through
many,
many
months
of
hearings
to
obtain
something
like
the
burke
study.
it
might
have
been
that
had
the
government
complied
with
this
order,
the
case
might
have
been
closed,
or
resolved
in
the
manner
that
a
district
judge
would,
for
example,
resolve
a
summary
judgment
question.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
believe
that's
the
ultimate
finding.
the
burke
study--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--well,
may
i
suggest,
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
precisely
why
the
district
judge
made
the
order
that
she
did
asking
for
expert
testimony.
the
judge
was
not
willing,
on
the
record
before
her,
to
find
the
government's
explanation
for
the
pattern
persuasive.
in
fact,
she
said,
i
cannot
resolve
this
issue
without
expert
testimony,
and
the
kind
of
issues
that
you
pose,
justice
ginsburg,
are
the
kind
of
disputes
that
would
be
ongoing--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--i
don't
believe
that
we're
limited
solely
to
that
claim
and,
in
fact,
there
may
be
other
areas
of
selectivity
that
come
up
as
discovery
is--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--the
question
of
the
appropriate
universe
for
comparison
has
been
shifting
over
the
course
of
time,
and
during
this
3-1/2
years
or--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--that
was
one
point.
there
may
have
been
other
areas
for
us
to
pursue.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
understand
that,
justice
breyer.
my
problem
in
responding
to
that
question,
however,
is
that
i
think
it's
wrong
to
say
that
the
universe
of
comparators
is
established,
or
must
be
established
by
the
defense
before
the
defense
requests
discovery,
and
this
case
is
the
perfect
example
of
an
evolving
universe
of
comparators.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
well,
certainly,
justice
scalia,
the
universe
of
cases
presented
to
you
is
much
different
from
the
universe
of
cases
that
are
dealt
with
at
the
district
level,
where
guilt
and
innocence
is
determined
every
day,
and
we
are
certainly
present
for
much
of
that.
it's
the
rare
case
where
a
racial
claim
does
go
forward,
and
it's
the
rare
case
where
a
motion
to
suppress
is
granted.
when
statistics
such
as
those
we
compile
are
presented,
however,
that
is
the
rare
case
where
a
district
judge
must--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--have
discretion
to
look
at
the
issue.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
that
certainly
is
the
backdrop
against
which
this
whole
issue
is
framed,
the
disparity
between
the
sentencing
schemes
that
everyone
is
concerned
about
at
all
levels
and
in
all
branches
of
government.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
if
that
presumption
is
true,
and
the
government
is
able
to
come
forward
with
evidence
that
shows--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--i
believe
the
sentencing
commission
is
certainly
concerned
about
the
pattern
of
prosecutions.
the
sentencing
commission
has
no
idea
what
cases
are
being
declined.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
would
disagree
with
the
idea
that
that
has
been
proven.
i
think
there
are
many
white
crack
cocaine
users
and
dealers
out
there.
i
don't
think
the
government
argues
that--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--the
sentencing
commission
is
looking
at
the
end
result.
they're
looking
at
the
convictions,
the
sentences
imposed.
they
have
some
information
about
users
and
dealers,
but
primarily
their
focus
is
on
the
sentencing
scheme.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
mr.
chief
justice,
what
we're
seeking
is
the
beginning
of
the
argument,
in
this
case,
to
attempt
to
gather
more
information.
certainly,
the
focus
of
the
sentencing
commission
is
different,
and
at
the
same
time
it
involves
the
same
issue,
the
issue
of
concern
about
racial
injustice.
solicitor
general
days
mentioned
the
high
cost
to
the
government
of
providing
information,
and
we'd
suggent
that
an
even
higher
cost
to
the
criminal
justice
exists
when
unfairness
is
perceived.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
justice
souter,
you're
referring
to
judge
reinhardt's
statement
that
we
must
assume
all
persons
commit
all
crimes?
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
think
that
that
statement
was
more
in
the
nature
of
a
descriptive
statement.
i
did
not
read
that--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--as
a
binding
presumption.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
no.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
and
in
fact
i
would
suggest
the
government
is
depending
on
the
opposite
presumption,
that
only
blacks
commit
the
crime,
and
had
they
shown
that,
we
might
not
have
succeeded
in
our
request--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--well,
as
the
court
may
be
aware,
i
did
provide
a
limited
declaration
in
response
to
the
government's
motion
for
reconsideration,
and
i
think
the
district
judge
did
consider
the
two
declarations
that
we
submitted.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
mr.
reed
submitted
a
declaration
laying
out
his
experience
in
state
court,
his
perceptions
of
the
nature
of
the
defendants
that
were
being
prosecuted
in
state
court,
which
is
directly
across
the
street--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--from
us,
and
we
submitted
another
declaration
regarding
some
information
from
a
treatment
facility.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
recall
they
were
signed
declarations.
whether
they
were
sworn
under
penalty
of
perjury,
i
can't
recall.
perhaps
not.
i
can
represent
one
of
them
but
not
for
xx.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
mr.
reed
laid
out
a
description
of
his
experience
in
state
court.
again--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--well,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
district
judge
in
central
district
of
california--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--he
did
say
that
whites
were
prosecuted
in
state
court
for
crack
cocaine
violations.
at
the
time,
the
definition
of
similarly
situated
was
somewhat
up
in
the
air,
and
i
would
suggest
remains
somewhat
up
in
the
air.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
we
at
the
time
did
not
know
what
similarly
situated
was,
and
as
i
am
perhaps
not
explaining
sufficiently,
i
think
that
definition
continues
to
evolve,
and
our
point
is
to
require
us
to
present
evidence
of
similarly
situated
individuals
at
such
an
early
stage
is
premature,
because
we
don't
know
who
is
similarly
situated.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
don't
believe
any
court
has
ever
held
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
a
similarly
situated
individual
to
succeed
on
a
claim
of
selective
prosecution,
and
certainly
the
government
concedes
that's
not
true.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
would--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--our
position
is
that
selectivity
is
the
issue,
not
similarly
situated
individuals,
and
certainly--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--i
think
i'm
proffering
a
broader
definition,
which
is
that
at
the
initial
stage
it's
clear
selectivity
has
occurred.
in
the
vast
number
of
criminal
cases,
very
few
are
brought
to...
to
federal
court.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
what
is
evident
is
that
based
on
our
experience
it
was
an
unusual
pattern,
a
pattern
that
caused
my
office
concern
and
then,
in
turn,
caused
the
district
judge
concern.
it's
not
the
normal
pattern
for
us
to
observe.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
would
agree
that
it
is
the
point
at
which
to
start,
and
that's
where
we
were.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i
would
not
know
what
the
relationship
is
and,
frankly,
based
on
the
government's
proffer
of
different
variables
over
time,
we
are
looking
at
those
aspects
also.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
yes,
i
believe
these
were--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--i
perhaps
am
misspeaking
on
that.
i
perhaps
am
misspeaking.
i
would
have
to
look
at
my
chart
to
see
if
they
were
listed
in
fact.
nevertheless,
what
these
defendants
had
in
common
was
their
race.
they
were
charged
in
the
same
case.
they
are
not
all
similar.
some
of
the
variables--
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
--i
wouldn't
suggest
that
that
is
true
or
is
proven
at
this
point,
justice
kennedy.
if
i
may,
to
sum
up,
i
believe
that
the
special
standard
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general
is
far
too
stringent
on
a
claim
of
racial
selectivity
and
that,
in
fact,
no
special
standard
is
required.
rather,
the
court
is
compelled
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case,
which
is,
number
1,
to
determine,
as
justice
souter
suggested,
there
is
some
evidence
that
a
defense
exists,
a
colorable
basis
to
believe
that
selective
prosecution
has
occurred
which
can
be
defeated
by
the
government
and
in
this
case
was
not.
the
court
then
reviews
the
defense
and
determines
whether
the
evidence
requested
is
material.
the
court
is
also
obligated
to
look
at
the
factors
that
any
court
does
in
a
district...
in
a
discovery
dispute,
namely
the
access
of
the
parties.
it's
clear
there
are
findings,
exclusive
findings
in
this
case,
that
the
government
had
access
to
the
information.
ms.
barbara
e.
o'connor
i'm
not
certain
that
i
should
comment
on
that,
justice
scalia,
but--
