justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
we
agree
with
you
that
in
fact
there's...
there
are
two
prongs
involved
here,
and
we
then
pose
justice
ginsburg's
question,
what
if
they
had
come
in
with
the
evidence
which
i
guess
turned
up
later,
a
year
or
so
later
in
the
state
reports,
that
something
like
50
percent
of
the
state
crack
prosecutions
were
caucasians,
i
take
it...
and
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
you
would
say,
even
though
that
addressed
the
second
prong,
it
did
not
address
it
to
a
sufficient
degree.
it
did
not
meet
the
high...
the
substantial
threshold
test,
and
i
assume
the
reason
you
would
say
that
is
because
the
state
statistics
do
not
show
how
many
of
these
people
were
gun
carriers,
and
it
doesn't
show
the
severity
of
the
offense.
did
they
have
just
a
little
bit
of
crack,
or
were
they
dealers,
and
so
on.
you
would
say
that
it
still
wasn't
enough,
even
though
it
addressed
the
question
of
comparability,
to
show
that
there
really
was
comparability.
would
that
be
the
government's
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
just
assume
that
they
couldn't
have
had
anything
but
the
terms
of
the
study,
and
they
said,
this
satisfies
each
of
the
prongs.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
be
the
government's
position
that
it
didn't
satisfy
the
second
one
because
it
did
not
show
to
a
sufficiently
high
or
probable
degree
that
there
really
was
comparability?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you
would
say,
then,
that
you
had
a
burden
to
respond.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
a
burden
to
comply
with
the
discovery
request.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
want
to
understand...
i,
like
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
trying
to
get
an
example
so
that
i
know
what
we
really
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--when
we
use
the
terms,
and
i
take
it
in
the
example
you're
saying...
that
i
gave,
that
that
would
result
perhaps
in
a
shifting
of
the
burden
of
persuasion,
or
at
least
the
burden
of
going
forward,
but
it
would
not
result
in
a
satisfaction
of
this
threshold
which
would
obligate
you
to
produce
the
discovery
that
they
want.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
some
discovery,
then,
would...
so
you're
saying
discovery
is
a
step-by-step
process,
and
the
government
would
perhaps
not
merely
have
had
the
burden
shifted
back
to
it,
but
the
government
could
properly
be
subjected
by
the
district
judge,
as
it
were,
to
satisfy
that
burden.
the
judge
could
say,
look,
you
produce
some
rebutting
evidence,
and
you
would
be
subject
to
that
degree
of
discovery,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
quite...
i
realize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
you're
saying,
then,
is
that
i
think
that
it's
a
mistake
to
think
of
discovery...
the
discovery
obligation
as
being
an
all-or-nothing
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
that
if
you
went
as
far
as
to
get
the
burke
study
in,
there
would
be
a
discovery
obligation
to
produce
evidence,
if
you
had
it,
that
would
tend
to
disprove
the
suggestion
of
comparability,
and
if
you
met
that,
that's
where
the
process
would
end.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
didn't
meet
that,
then
i
presume
even
further
discovery
might
be
warranted.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
realize...
no,
i
realize--
--what
was
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
that
there
is
not
that
power
an
answer
across
the
board?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
are
some
constitutional
issues
which
can
only
be
litigated
if
the
court
does
have
the
power
to
order
discovery--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
this
be
one
of
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
what
about
this?
why
wouldn't
the
judge
simply
as
a
matter
of
necessity
in
implementing
the
equal
protection
clause--
justice
david
h.
souter
--have
the
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he
would.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
you,
i
take
it,
don't
depend
upon
judge
reinhardt's
assumption
to
establish
the
second
prong,
the
similarly
situated
but
not
prosecuted
prong.
am
i
correct
you
don't
depend
on
judge
reinhardt's
assumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
depend
on
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
depend
on
it
for
your
argument?
i
assumed
you
didn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
government
at
least
has
some
figures,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
you
do.
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
you
thought,
or
you
believed
that
whites
were
committing
these
crimes.
why
didn't
you
come
forward
with
an
affidavit
of
your
own
detailing
what
it
was
you
knew
that
was
the
basis
for
this
belief?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
the
reference
to
the
state
experience?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
don't
know
that,
then
you
don't
know
sort
of
the
fundamental
structure
of
your
argument.
you
have
no
claim
unless
there
are
similarly
situated
individuals.
don't
you
therefore,
in
order
to
make
a
claim,
have
at
least
an
initial
obligation
to
define
a
class
so
that
both
you
can
tell,
in
making
your
assertion,
and
the
judge
can
tell
in
passing
on
it,
what
you
mean
by
similarly
situated?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
there
isn't
an
understanding
of
what
similarly
situated
means,
how
is
there
even
a
claim
of
selective
prosecution?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
implies
selection,
and
the
implication
of
selection
requires
some
understanding
of
a
class,
some
of
those
members
are
being
treated
one
way,
and
some
of
whose
members
are
being
treated
differently.
how
can
you
make
the
claim
without
at
least
defining
your
class
and
hence
defining
what
similarly
situated
people
are?
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
not
meeting.
we're
not
engaging
here.
maybe
i'm
missing
some
point,
but
i'm
saying
that
if
you
claim
that
there
has
been
selective
prosecution...
i
understand
you
to
be
claiming
that
there
has
been
disparate
treatment
of
individuals
who
are
in
all
relevant
respects
alike,
and
in
order
to
make
that
claim
you
have
to
understand
what
the
class
is
which
is
in
all
respects
alike,
and
you
therefore
at
least
have
to
start
with
a
notion
of
what
similarly
situated
people
might
be
like.
isn't
that
true?
isn't
that
what
you
mean
when
you
say
the
prosecution
has
been
selective?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
is
it
clear
in
this
case
that
selectivity
has
occurred?
you
came
up...
came
forward
and
said
there
were,
what,
24
prosecutions
of
black
individuals
for
crack
and
guns.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
self-evident
about
selectivity
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be
the
point
from
which
you
start,
but
it
is
not
the
point
at
which
you
have
defined
a
similarly
situated
class,
i
would
suppose.
