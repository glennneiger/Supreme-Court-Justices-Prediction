john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
suppose...
i
don't
remember
which
brief
it
is.
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
says
if
you
looked
a
little
harder
at
statistics
you'd
find
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
pattern
in
state
and
federal
courts.
if
those
facts
are
correct,
and
if
they
had
been
presented
to
the
district
court,
would
it
have
been
appropriate
to
have
discovery
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
came
in
with
an
affidavit,
the
public
defender
said,
our
files
in
state
court
show
that
50
percent
of
the
crack
prosecutions
are
not
afro-americans,
whereas
100
percent
of
the
federal
prosecutions
are,
would
that
be
sufficient
for
discovery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
you
decide
if
you
were
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
universe
is
the
files
of
the
federal...
of
the
state
defender
and
the
federal
defender
in
1991.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
there
are
100
cases
in
each
file?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask--
--flawed
or
not,
what
was
the
percent
that
was
shown
in
the
state
courts
in
that
study?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
days,
can
i
go
back
to
a
really
fundamental
question
that's
troubling
me
here--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
we're
really
talking
about
discovery,
not
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
case.
is
it
the
government's
position
that
rule
16
is
the
source
of
the
authority,
or
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
authority
must
be
found
elsewhere,
the
authority
for
a
judge
to
order
discovery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
rule
16
provides
the
authority,
or
if
it's
not
there,
is
it
possible
it's
found
elsewhere?
that's
my
question.
what
is
the
source...
do
you
acknowledge
the
judge
has
authority,
and
whatever
the
threshold
is,
when
you
meet
the
standard,
can
the
judge
order
discovery,
and
if
so,
why?
where
does
he
get
the
power?
is
it
all
from
rule
16,
or
even
if
rule
16
does
not
apply,
is
there
nevertheless
authority,
an
inherent
power
kind
of
authority
in
the
judge
to
order
discovery
in
an
appropriate
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we
find
that
rule
16
applies,
that's
the
end
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
does
it
follow,
if
rule
16
doesn't
grant
it,
that
there
is
no
authority?
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand
you
don't...
but
if
an
appropriate
showing
is
made,
and
if
rule
16
does
not
apply,
would
the
government
agree
that
there
is
power
in
the
judge
to
order
discovery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
not
that
power.
