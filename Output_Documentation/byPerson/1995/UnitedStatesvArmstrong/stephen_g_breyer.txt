g.

what
does
that
suggest
you
do,
for
example,
to
suppression?
what
does
it
do
to
motions
to
suppress?
what
does
it
do
to
fifth
amendment
claims?
what
does
it
do
to
fourth
amendment
claims?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
do
to
a
whole
range
of
claims
that
actually
are
there
for
reasons
of
constitutional
or
administrative--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
i'm
nervous
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
a
rule
that
had
in
some
words
about
reasonableness,
and
they
cut
out
the
words
about...
at
least
that's
what
my
law
clerk
found
out.
there
was
a
previous
rule
that
had
a
standard
of
reasonableness
in
it,
and
then
they
cut
that
out.
are
you...
you
may
not
be
familiar
with
it,
in
which
case
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
couldn't
you
just
go
to
a...
you
know,
in
your
own
office,
in
your
own
experience,
other
people?
you'd
say,
look,
have...
anybody
had
a
defendant
who
was
white,
who
was
accused
of
a
crack
case?
you
could
go
to
a
bar
association
meeting
and
say,
aren't
there
anybody
here,
you
know,
a
bar...
a
criminal
defense
lawyers
meeting,
or...
say,
please,
i
just
need
some
examples.
aren't
there
any
examples
here
of
two
or
three
people
who
are
crack
defendants
who
are
white?
and
i
would
have
thought,
if
there
is
selective
prosecution,
they
would
have
had
lots
of
examples,
and
why
is
that
a
burden?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
one,
but...
i
have
no
idea
what
the
number
would
be.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
i
think
is
what
justice
ginsburg
was
trying
to
get
at.
the
government
has
argued
within
rule
16
a
selective
prosecution
case
is
a
tough
case
to
make,
really
tough,
because
it...
because
of
various
policies
and
prosecutorial
discretion,
and
so
forth.
you
should
at
least
have
to
show
that
there
are
some...
they
don't
say
what
number,
but
that
there
were
some
comparably
situated
white
defendants
who
were
not
prosecuted
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
is
it
a
burden
to
do
that?
why
is
it
difficult
just
to
go
to
a
meeting
in
your
own
office,
the
state
office,
the
bar
association,
and
say,
we're
trying
to
make
out
this
defense.
i'd
appreciate
anyone
who
can
give
me
examples
of
white
crack
defendants
who
were
prosecuted
in
state
court.
it
should
be
easy.
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
the
problem,
because
being
a
very
good
defense
lawyer,
you
probably
could
think
of
dozens
and
dozens
of
possible
comparisons,
and
what's
worrying
me
is
that,
because
you
are
so
good
at
thinking
up
definite...
you
know,
lots
of
different
comparisons,
some
of
which
may
be
true,
i
don't
know,
but
if
the...
if
there
isn't
some
burden
to
show,
in
addition
to
the
large
number
of
african-americans
who
were
prosecuted
in
this
category,
here
are
some
comparable
people
who
were
caucasian,
and
they
weren't,
which
doesn't
seem
like
a
big
burden,
that
the
thing
could
go
on
endlessly
as
you
think
of
more
and
more
categories
and
they
have
to
respond
more
and
more.
that's
what's
actually
worrying
me.
that's
why
i
asked,
couldn't
you
just
ask
at
a
meeting
of
defense
lawyers,
did
anyone
have
a
white
defendant?
that's
my
whole
problem,
which
i'm
asking
you
to
respond.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was...
were
the
24
related
to
each
other?
i
mean,
is
there
a...
were
there
in
the
same
gangs,
any
group
of
them?
were
they
in
the
same
housing
projects,
are
they
24
totally
disparate...
separate
individuals,
or
is
there
some
relationship
among
subsets
of
those
24?
