chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-157,
united
states
v.
christopher
lee
armstrong.
general
days,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
you
have
some
reservation
about
phrases
like,
a
colorable
basis,
as
giving
any
real
guidance
to
what
to
look
for
in
the
details.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
days.
ms.
o'connor,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
there
is
a
difference,
ms.
o'connor,
between
the
kind
of
defenses
one
normally
talks
about
to
a
criminal
prosecution
and
the
selective
prosecution
argument,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
it
results...
in
other
words,
the
person
simply
"walks".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
show
that
there
was
a
selective
prosecution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
goes
scott-free.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
her
own
experience
of
what
sort,
ms.
o'connor?
could
she
say,
now,
i've
been
sitting
here
for
10
years,
and
i've
tried
so
many
of
these
crack
cocaine
cases,
and
all
the
defendants
were
black?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
would
be
permissible,
in
your
view,
for
the
district
court
to
take
into
consideration
in
granting
a
discovery
request
her
own
recollection
of
the
percentage
of
blacks
and
caucasians
that
had
been
in
crack
cocaine
cases
in
her
particular
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
ask
you
what
common
sense
told
us.
i
asked
you
if
you
thought
it
would
be
correct
for
a
district--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
don't
accept
judgments
of
conviction
as
probative
because
you
say
they
themselves
may
have
been
the
result
of
racial
prosecution,
then
there
can
never
be
any
end
to
the
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
declaration,
ms.
o'connor,
does
that
suggest
the
statements
were
sworn?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
o'connor.
[laughter]
general
days,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
