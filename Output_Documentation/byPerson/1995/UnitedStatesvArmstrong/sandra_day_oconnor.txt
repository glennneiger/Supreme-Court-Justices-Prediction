justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
days,
do
you
agree
that
the
standard
on
this
discovery
claim
should
be
whether
a
colorable
basis
is
made
out
for
the
claim?
is
that
the
standard?
is
that
the
standard
most
commonly
used
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
accept
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
do
you
ask
us
to
adopt
some
other
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
your
argument
that
that
showing
is
necessary
to
establish
a
colorable
basis?
how
do
you
articulate
the
standard
that
the
court
should
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
days,
are
there
things
that
were
requested
in
this
case
that
fall
within
rule
16's
(a)(1)(c)
articulation...
books,
papers,
documents
in
the
possession
or
control
of
the
government?
were
things
asked
for
that
fit
within
that
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
o'connor,
do
you
think
that
either
the
district
court
or
the
ninth
circuit
was
relying
on
rule
16
in
making
their
various
orders
and
judgments?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
mention
it,
and
how
are
we
to
know
if
they
were
thinking
in
terms
of
rule
16?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
everything
you
were
seeking
matters
that
you
think
are
covered
by
rule
16?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
rule
16
can
be
used
to
require
the
government
to
conduct
a
survey,
or
produce
information
that
it
doesn't
already
have
reduced
to
documentation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
what
is
the
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
at
the
time
that
your
discovery
request
was
made,
and
that
the
district
court
made
its
ruling,
is
the
only
thing
the
district
court
had
before
it
the
summary
of
the
closed
cases
for
the
year
in
question
from
the
central
district?
is
that
the
sum
total
of
what
was
offered,
and
that
the
district
court
had
in
front
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
the
time
of
its
order.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
at
the
time
the
district
court
entered
its
order.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
its
initial
order.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
that
was
sufficient
to
compel
the
discovery,
and
to
justify
the
order?
