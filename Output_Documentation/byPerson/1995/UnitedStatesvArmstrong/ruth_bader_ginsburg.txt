justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
tell
us
what
the
details
would
be?
in
a
case
like
this,
just
what
evidence
that's
accessible
to
the
defendant
would
be
necessary
to
establish
a
basis
for
discovery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
at
least
would
you
seek--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
days,
before
we
get
to
the
question
of
what
could
be
discovered
if
there
could
be
discovery,
you
were
going
to
tell
me
what
in
the
government's
view
would
be
necessary
concretely
to
satisfy
that
substantial
threshold
question,
and
you
gave
one
answer
that
i
found
surprising,
but
it
was
your
answer
that
even
if
you
had
100
percent
african
americans
in
federal
court
in
a
given
year
and
50
percent
caucasians
in
the
state
court
in
that
same
year,
that
that
would
not
have
been
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
that
would
require
something
rather
than
nothing,
but
if...
i'm
just
not
clear
on...
the
government
does
the
negative
side--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
but
you
don't
say
what
it
would
take.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
knowledge
of
the
public
defender?
the
public
defender
has
knowledge,
or
access
to
knowledge
of
what's
going
on
in
the
state
courts,
and
also
typical
in
these
cases
to
have
statistics,
and
sometimes
individual
instances,
but
no
individual
instance
was
brought
forward
of
a
similarly
situated
caucasian
who
was
prosecuted
in
the
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is,
what
did
you
have
to
show
to
meet
the
threshold
for
discovery,
and
i'm
asking,
is
such
information
accessible
to
a
defendant
without
resort
to
discovery
against
the
u.s.
attorney,
and
i
think
you've
just
answered
yes,
it
is,
but
you
didn't
get
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
o'connor,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
burke
study
showed
that
there
was...
the
figure
of
white
defendants
was
between
3
and
4
percent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
just
sticking
with
that,
it's
nothing
like
50
percent,
3
and
4
percent.
if
you
take
the
universe
of
prosecutions
in
the
federal
court
for
crack
cocaine
conspiracies,
3
to
4
percent
would
equal
how
many
defendants?
not
many.
maybe
even
a
fraction
of
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
the
expert
testimony.
if
the
numbers
would
show
that
if
you're
comparing
state
and
federal
you
would
expect
very
few
caucasians
in
the
federal
court,
because
you're
not
trying
to
make...
you're
trying
to
make
a
case
of
comparing
state
and
federal.
well,
the
numbers
that
came
out
don't
seem
to
support
your
case
very
strongly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
o'connor--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
question,
why
should
this
be
the
rare
case
in
light
of
something
else
that
has
been
going
on?
the
ninth
circuit
said,
we
must
assume
going
in
that
all
kinds
of
people
commit
all
kinds
of
crimes,
and
yet
we
have
seen
for
the
first
time
ever
a
proposal
of
the
sentencing
commission
rejected
by
congress,
and
it
was
to
even
out
the
penalties
between
crack
cocaine
crimes
and
powdered
cocaine
for
the
very
reason
that
whites
commit
disproportionately
powdered
cocaine
crimes
and
african-americans
disproportionately
crack
cocaine
crimes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
concern
stems
from
the
identity
of
a
particular
crime
with
one
racial
group
more
than
another.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
sentencing
commission
thought
it
was
true.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
o'connor,
specifically
what
was
declared
in
the
statement,
in
the
two
statements
that
you
say
came
up
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
he
say
there
have
been
a
white...
similarly
situated
whites
prosecuted
in
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
just
said
whites
were
prosecuted,
but
not
similarly
situated?
