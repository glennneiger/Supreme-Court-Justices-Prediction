justice
antonin
scalia
general
days,
what
is
your
basis
for
requiring
a
substantial
threshold
showing
with
respect
to
this
category
of
defense,
assuming
that
we're
proceeding
under
rule
16?
is
that
what
we're...
are
we
proceeding
under
rule
16?
if
we're
under
rule
16,
what
it
says
is
that
upon
request
of
the
defendant,
the
government
shall
permit
the
defendant
to
inspect
and
copy,
blah,
blah,
blah,
which
are
within
the
possession,
custody,
or
control
of
the
government,
and
which
are
material
to
the
preparation
of
the
defense.
now,
we
do
not
in
other
situations
inquire
how
strong
the
defense
is
before
we
apply
that
provision.
what
is
the
justification
for
doing
it
here,
unless...
unless
rule
16
is
not
applicable.
do
we
have
some
argument
that
it's
not
applicable?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
a
general
right
to
discovery.
it's
set
forth
in
rule
16.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
apart
from
rule
16
there
is
no
general
right,
i
assume,
and
if
you
can
get
me
out
of
rule
16,
then
i'll
be
prepared
to
entertain
your
notion
that
we
should
require
a
substantial
showing
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
say
a
substantial
threshold
showing
that
the
defense
is
valid
is
always
necessary
under
rule
16.
is
that...
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
just
a
special
showing
you
were
going
to
require
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
i
was
going
to
suggest
is
that
rule
16...
what
is
it,
16(a)(2)
makes
it
clear
that
you
can't
use
(c)...
(a)(1)(c).
are
you
reading
from
somewhere
in
the
briefs?
i'm
reading
from
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
chief
justice,
rule
16.
i
don't
know
where
it's
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
but
i
think
we
have
it
up
here
somewhere.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
briefs
anywhere
set
forth
the
entirety
of
rule
16.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
complete
the
thought
i
was
beginning
with.
there
is
a
provision
of
rule
16
which
says
that
subsection
(c),
which
is
what
is
relied
on
here,
does
not,
it
says...
i'll
read
it.
except
as
provided
in
paragraphs
(a),
(b),
(d)
and
(e)--
--what
page
of
the
rules
are
you
reading?
it
is
rule
16--
--72.
--(a)(2).
thank
you.
which
says
that
except
as
provided
in
paragraphs
(a),
(b),
(d),
and
(e),
notably
excluding
(c),
this
rule
does
not
authorize
the
discovery
or
inspection
of
reports,
memoranda,
or
other
internal
government
documents
made
by
the
attorney
for
the
government
or
other
government
agents
in
connection
with
the
investigation
or
prosecution
of
the
case.
now,
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that
(c)
enables
you
to
get
all
of
the
government
information
relating
to
this
discriminatory
prosecution
matter,
all
government
documents
except
those
relating
to
this
case,
all
those
relating
to
these
other
cases
but
not
to
this
case.
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that,
but
that
would
be
a
very
strange
rule,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
existence
of
(2)
suggests
that
perhaps
the
word,
relating
to
the
defense,
material
to
the
preparation
of
the
defendant's
defense
in
(c)
refers
to
defense
on
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
not
to
a
defense
of
this
sort.
yes.
and
that
would
get
you
out
of
rule
16,
and
then
we
could
talk
about
what
the
constitution
requires
the
government
to
cough
up,
and
we
could
adopt
a
rule
such
as,
for
a
defense
of
this
sort
there
has
to
be
substantial
threshold
showing.
but
as
long
as
you
leave
me
in
rule
16,
i
have
real
troubles.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
a
court
of
appeals
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
one
of
our
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
the
only
cases
of
ours
that
i'm
aware
of...
what
cases
of
ours
involve
this
area
of
selective
prosecution?
yick
wo
and
ah
sin--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
was
the...
what
was
involved
in
wick?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
in
both
ah
sin
and
yick
wo,
which
are
the
classic
cases,
you
had
at
issue
a
local
ordinance,
and
the
ordinance
was
a
phony,
because
in
fact
it
was
only
being
enforced
against
one
racial
group.
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
a
parallel
at
the
federal
level,
where
you
have
a
valid
federal
criminal
statute
and
even
in
one
jurisdiction,
even
one
u.s.
attorney
is
in
fact
enforcing
it
against
only
one
racial
group.
why
should
that
be
the
level
that
you
inquire
into
to
see
whether
there's
been
discriminatory
enforcement?
why
shouldn't
it
be
all
prosecutions
by
a
particular
u.s.
attorney?
suppose
you
show
that
this
particular
u.s.
attorney
has
never
brought
a
prosecution
against
a
white
man
under
this
statute.
would
that
be
enough
to
show
selective
prosecution,
even
though
the
rest
of
the
office
is
prosecuting
everybody
indiscriminately,
and
some
of
them
may
have
brought
prosecutions
only
against
whites,
and
not
against
blacks?
justice
antonin
scalia
probably--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
why
should
the
office
be
the
criterion?
i'm
very
resistant
to
the
notion
that
because
you
have
one
bad
egg
in
the
federal
prosecutor's
office
we
punish
him
by
letting
somebody
who's
been
duly
convicted
of
a
crime
walk
away.
why
shouldn't
the
test
be
whether
this
statute
is
being
selectively
enforced
nationwide,
just
as
that
was
the
issue
in
yick
wo
and
ah
sin?
why
should
one
u.s.
attorney's
office
invalidate
the
whole
system?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
sanction
him,
but
why
should
the
criminal
defendant
who's
been
guilty
of
the
offense
walk
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to...
under
16
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
any
documents
pertaining
to
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
strange
to
establish
a
selective
prosecution
claim
without
the
use
of
any
documents
pertaining
to
the
case
in
which
the
selective
prosecution
is
alleged
to
have
occurred.
isn't
that
extraordinary?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
what
it
suggests
to
me,
the
fact
that
you
cannot
get
any
of
these
documents
from
this
prosecutor,
is
that
rule
16
was
not
designed
for
this
kind
of
a
defense
at
all,
that
perhaps
when
it
refers
to
the
defendant's
defense,
it
means
his
defense
on
the
merits,
and
this
constitutional
claim
comes
up
under
our
inherent
powers
to
require
discovery
with
respect
to
constitutional
claims.
isn't
that
a
possibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
a
likelihood?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
just
in
accord
with
the
principle
that,
you
know,
we
do
try
to
have
the
main
issue
in
trials
be
whether
the
defendant
is
guilty
or
not.
that
is
so
rarely
the
issue
nowadays,
in
cases
that
come
up
to
us,
anyway.
the
issue
is
whether
the
government
has
been
guilty
of
not
turning
over
information
required
by
brady,
or
whether
the
government
conducted
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
or
whether
the
government
did
not
give
a
proper
miranda
warning,
or,
if
the
government
has
behaved
properly,
whether
the
attorney
was
incompetent
and
did
something
wrong.
isn't
it
reasonable
to
insist
that
by
and
large
our
criminal
trials
ought
to
be
about
whether
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
what
he's
charged
with
having
done
and,
therefore,
shouldn't
we
establish
a
fairly
high
threshold
to
bring
in
these
extraneous
issues
which
enable
defense
counsel
to
put
the
government
on
trial
instead
of
the
defendant,
and
the
government
is
saying,
we
want
a
high
threshold.
you
have
to
come
in
with
a
substantial
showing.
why
isn't
that
a
good
enough
reason
for
it?
the
criminal
prosecutions
are
supposed
to
be
about
whether
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
suppose
that
discriminatory
prosecution
cannot
be
remedied
as
discriminatory
taxation
can,
for
example,
in
a
commerce
clause
case,
by
after
the
fact
going
out
and
finding
the
24
white
people
to
prosecute.
it's
too
late,
isn't
it?
