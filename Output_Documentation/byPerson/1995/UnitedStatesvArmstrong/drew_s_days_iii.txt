mr.
drew
s.
days,

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
selective
prosecution
claims
are
among
the
most
difficult
our
courts
have
to
face,
for
they
require
striking
an
especially
delicate
balance
between
protecting
prosecutorial
discretion
and
decisionmaking
from
improper,
outside
interferences
and
scrutiny
while
ensuring
that
the
law
is
in
force
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
and
the
rule
of
law.
this
court
has
noted
that
judicial
scrutiny
of
a
prosecutor's
charging
decision
imposes
high
costs
on
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
that
since
tradition
and
experience
have
taught
that
most
prosecutors
will
faithfully
obey
their
duty,
courts
should
properly
be
hesitant
to
examine
the
decision
whether
to
prosecute.
but
courts
must
also
discharge
their
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
government
enforces
the
laws
evenhandedly,
rather
than
based
upon
invidious
discrimination,
but
when
the
government
acts
with
an
evil
eye
and
an
unequal
hand,
rather
than
in
a
manner
faithful
to
equal
protection
and
due
process,
both
those
directly
affected
by
that
conduct
in
the
rule
of
law
are
its
victims.
this
court's
decisions,
especially
in
yick
wo
and
wayte,
have
struck
this
balance
on
the
merits
by
requiring
that,
absent
proof
of
an
explicitly
discriminatory
classification,
a
criminal
defendant
alleging
selective
prosecution
must
make
two
showings
in
order
to
prevail,
first,
that
persons
in
similar
circumstances
have
not
been
prosecuted
and,
second,
that
the
difference
in
treatment
is
motivated
by
an
intent
to
discriminate
against
the
group
to
which
the
defendant
belongs.
in
other
words,
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
both
discriminatory
effect
and
discriminatory
purport.
this
case,
however,
presents
for
decision
a
question
that
this
court
has
yet
to
resolve,
namely,
what
standards
should
federal
courts
utilize
in
determining
whether
a
criminal
defendant
alleging
selective
prosecution
is
entitled
to
discovery.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
is
the
locution
that's
used
by
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
not
completely--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
think
that,
although
the
courts
have
used
various
formulations,
the
bottom
line
is
that
all
the
courts
of
appeals,
with
the
exception
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
have
addressed
this
issue
have
required
that
there
be
a
showing
of
individuals
who
are
similarly
situated
to
the
defendant.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
colorable
basis
terminology
that's
used...
there
have
been
references
to
prima
facie
evidence.
we
think
that
the
best
standard
is
one
derived
from
this
court's
decision
in
wade
v.
united
states,
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
threshold
showing.
that
is,
there
has
to
be
something
more
than
assertions
and
generalized
proffers
on
information
and
belief.
there
has
to
be
concrete
evidence
that
the
court
can
look
to
that
leads
it
to
believe
that
there's
some
basis
for
thinking
that
there
is
selective
prosecution
at
work.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
precisely
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
the
respondents
have
made
the
suggestion
that
the
evidence
that
they
need
is
within
the
control
of
the
government,
but
that
is
simply
not
so.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
there
were
many
things
that
the
respondents
could
have
done,
and
let
me
lay
them
out.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
they
could
have
done
a
further
review
of
their
own
files.
they
had
looked
at
only
cases
closed
in
1991,
even
though
those
cases
would
have
been
brought
over
a
3-year
period.
this
is
a
federal
public
defender's
office.
presumably
there
are
state
public
defender's
offices,
and
they
could
have
contacted
those
offices
to
determine
whether
the
racial
pattern
that
they
asserted
was
reflected
in
federal
court
was
present
or
absent
in
state
prosecutions.
also,
one
of
the
respondents'
counsel
provided
a
declaration.
mr.
reed
indicated--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
really
would
depend
upon
the
nature
of
that
evidence
and
whether
it
provided
a
basis
for
the
court--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
that
information--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i'd
have
to
look
at
the
universe.
i
would
have
to
look
at--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
1991
would
be
too
narrow
a
time
frame
for
that
type
of
determination.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
the
case,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
would
be
inadequate
under
these
circumstances.
it
certainly
would
not
solve
the
second
part
of
the
problem,
which
is
whether
there's
some
indication
of
discriminatory
intent.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
there
are
two
responses,
justice
scalia.
one
is
that,
as
the
court
has
recognized,
there's
no
general
right
to
discovery
in
a
criminal
trial,
and
this
court,
for
example,
in
wade,
recognized
that
there,
the
defendant
had
not
made
a
substantial
threshold
showing
to
require
the
prosecutor
to
open
up
his
files
to
explain
why
there
had
not
been
a
motion
for
substantial
assistance.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
don't
have
to
get
you
out
of
rule
16,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
materiality
requirement
suggests
that
there
has
to
be
some
showing
by
the
defendant
of
evidence,
some
factual
basis
for
believing
that
he
does
have
a
particular
defense,
and
so--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
is
really
circular
here.
it
gets
us
back
to
the
point--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
there
are
obviously
other
types
of
material
that
are
available
under
rule
16,
but
the
point
here
is
that
rule
16
has
to
be
read
against
a
backdrop
of
this
court's
presumption
that
prosecutors
act
lawfully,
and
that
the
investigation
by
outsiders
or
inquiries
by
outsiders
of
how
prosecutors
carry
out
their
responsibility
imposes
substantial
cost
on
the
system.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
justice
scalia,
as
we've
addressed
in
our
reply
brief,
there
are
specific
provisions
of
rule
16
that
go
to
the
availability
of
certain
material.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i'm
certainly
not
going
to
reject
that
suggestion,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
but
i
think
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--right.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
that
we
believe
we
can
remain
within
rule
16
and
nevertheless
support
the
substantial
threshold
showing
that
we've
been
advocating.
that's
in
essence
what
wade
said
about--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
it's
a
due
process
standard.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i'm
not
familiar--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
brady,
for
example,
is
a
rule
that
is
outside
of
rule
16.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
and
so
to
the
extent
there
are
these
constitutional
requirements,
i
think
as
justice
breyer
was
suggesting,
they
would
stand
outside
of
rule
16.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
certainly
documents.
there
was
a
request
for
a
list
of
federal
narcotics
prosecutions
and
firearms
prosecutions
that
were
brought
over
a
3-year
period
between
1989
and
1992.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
if
there
were
a
print-out,
just
like
a
paper
list,
i
suppose
that
could
be
regarded
as
a
document,
but
i
take
your
meaning.
normally
discovery
does
not
require
a
party
to
create
documents
in
connection
with
discovery.
there
was
also
a
request
for
information
with
respect
to
the
criteria
that
are
used
by
the
united
states
attorney's
office
for
the
central
district
of
california
in
bringing
crack
cocaine
prosecutions.
now,
to
the
extent
that
that
was
written
down
somewhere,
supposedly
it
could
be
argued
that
that's
a
document
that
was
available
under
rule
16.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think
that,
justice
ginsburg,
under
those
circumstances
the
court
might
well
ask
the
government
for
some
indication,
but
it
may
not
result
in
full
discovery,
or
the
providing
by
the
government
of
the
type
of
information
that
was
being
sought
here
to
the
defendants.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think
that
the
example
that
justice
stevens
gave,
and
you
gave,
would
be
going
a
very
long
way
toward
showing
that
there
was
a
selection.
there
would
be
people
similarly
situated.
at
least
presumably
that
would
require
the
government
to
say
something
in
response
to
that,
but
we
certainly
don't
have
that
in
this
case,
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
is
completely
dispense
with
that
requirement.
basically,
what
the
en
banc
court
held
was,
there's
no
need
to
show
a
comparable
pool.
what
you're
talking
about
is
a
comparable
pool,
a
statistical
disparity.
well,
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
was,
in
cases
like
this
there's
no
need
for
that
comparable
pool.
one
simply
assumes
that
persons
of
all
races
commit
all
crimes.
now,
that
has
some
rhetorical
power,
but
the
question
is,
what
objective
rule
it
offers
is
very
hard
to
discern.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
justice
souter.
if
you're
referring
to
the
burke
study
that
was
introduced
later,
that
is
a
study
that
i
think
proves
only
one
thing
that's
relevant
in
our
estimation
in
the
context
of
this
case,
and
that
is
that
the
defendants
in
that
particular
proceeding
where
the
burke
study
was
introduced
were
able
to
show
that
they
could
get
this
information,
and
therefore
the
argument
that
respondents
make
in
armstrong,
in
this
case,
that
they
could
not
have
acquired
that
comparative
information,
really
seems
quite
unpersuasive.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
justice
souter.
the
en
banc
court
suggests
that
what
the
government
was
demanding
here
was
that
defendants
include
some
sophisticated
regression
analyses
closely
following
the
dictates
of
the
scientific
method.
that
is
not
what
we
were
suggesting.
we
think
in
a
situation
such
as
you
describe
the
government
would
have
a
responsibility
to
come
forward
and
show,
in
some
fashion
or
another,
that
there
was
an
absence
of
comparability,
but
we
don't
think
that
defendants
should
be
put
to
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--responsibility
of
figuring
out
at
every
point
the
degree
to
which
one
group
is
comparable
to
the
other.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think
where
there
is
this
similarly
situated
showing,
that
may
well
shift
the
burden
to
the
government--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
not
the
full
discovery.
in
other
words,
it
would
not
operate
automatically,
but
i
think,
justice
souter,
that
unlike
this
case,
when
the
defendants
actually
show
that
there
is
a
similarly
situated
group...
that
is,
there
appears
to
be
some
comparability
between
the
two
populations...
that
then
gives
the
district
judge
some
authority
to
probe
that,
and
to
evaluate
exactly
what
those
figures
mean.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
right.
it's
a
step-by-step
process
once
the
defendants
have
shown
a
group
of
similarly
situated
individuals.
the
problem
with
this
particular
case
is
that
the
judge
was
asking
the
government
to
respond
before
there
had
been
an
established--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--situation.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
right.
take--
mr.
drew

iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
let
me
make...
yes,
that's
correct,
but
let
me
make
clear
about
the
burke
study.
that
has
been
challenged
by
the
government
as
being
significantly
flawed,
and
it
is
not
part
of
the
en
banc
decision.
it
was
referenced
by--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
dissents
for
the
panel.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
don't
recall,
justice
ginsburg,
because
there
were
challenges
as
to
the
accuracy
of
that
information.
but
i
just
wanted
to
respond
to
justice
souter
a
little
bit
further.
we
refer
to
the
case
of
united
states
v.
holmes.
that
was
a
case
where
a
black
farmer
had
been
charged
with
violating
the
law
with
respect
to
certain
contracts
that
he
had
with
the
government.
he
was
able
to
identify
the
names
of
30
white
farmers
who
had
not
been
prosecuted
for
crimes
charged
against
him.
under
those
circumstances,
the
district
court
asked
that
the
government
come
forward,
or
directed
the
government
to
come
forward
and
explain
that
disparity,
which
the
government
did
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
district
court.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it's
from...
it's
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
ah
sin,
and
wayte.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
and
wayte.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
in
wayte?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
wayte
had
to
do
with
the
allegation
that
persons
who
had
failed
to
register
for
the
draft
were
being
selectively
prosecuted
because
they
were
vocal
opponents
to
that
particular
program.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
some
showing
that
there
was
a
comparably
situated--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--white
defendant.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
government
certainly
is
not
standing
here
arguing
that
it's
permissible
for
any
u.s.
attorney
to
bring
discriminatory
prosecutions
and
avoid
the
sanction
of
the
law
simply
because
it's
one
office
as
opposed
to
the
entire
country.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
shows
that
there
is
selective
prosecution
generally
does
not
mean
that
that
particular
defendant
would
walk.
i
think
the
defendant
has
on
the
merits
the
responsibility
to
show
that
that
discriminatory
pattern
in
his
case
resulted
in
his
being
prosecuted.
mr.

mr.
drew

iii
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
as
a
general
matter
it
would
be
rule
16,
but
as
i've
indicated
there
are--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
the
respondents
are
relying
upon
rule
16
for
the
type
of
discovery
that
we're
seeking,
and
i
think
we've
made
very
clear
that
rule
16
doesn't
grant
that
authority.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
would
be
reluctant
to
say
that
a
district
judge
is
completely
precluded
from
ordering
discovery
under
some
circumstances,
but
there's
no
showing
of
any
such
circumstance
here.
mr.

i
would
say
that
there
is
not
