mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
an
october
evening
in
1988,
petitioner's
husband,
john
bennis,
was
arrested
for
having
illicit
sex
with
a
prostitute
in
one
of
the
bennis
family
automobiles,
and
detroit
police
seized
the
automobile.
both
tina
bennis'
interest
in
the
vehicle
and
her
husband's
interest
were
declared
forfeit
under
a
michigan
nuisance
abatement
statute.
the
michigan
supreme
court
rejected
petitioner's
claim
that
the
due
process
and
takings
clauses
protected
her,
an
innocent
owner,
from
forfeiture.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
the
record
shows
that
the
vehicle
was
co-owned.
that
is,
it
was
cotitled--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--it's
a
heavily
regulated
area
and
i
attempted
to
ascertain
which
common
law
joint
property
interest
this
most
closely
resembled.
i
found
nothing
definitive
on
that,
but
i
believe--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--i
believe
it's
close
to
a
tenant
in
common.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
the
automobile
was
titled
in
their
name,
but
there's
no--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--yes.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
in
both
names.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
i
believe
that
that
is
true,
your
honor,
that...
not
for
the
entire
automobile.
one
co-owner--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--no.
i
believe
that
both--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--i
do
not
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
i'm
sorry,
i
cannot,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
i
think
it...
i'm
quite
certain
that
the
sole
co-owner
does
not
have
the
right
to
sell
the
entire
vehicle.
that
much
i'm
certain
of,
that
both
signatures
would
be
required
to
dispose
of
the--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--i
cannot.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
that
much
i'm
quite
sure
of,
your
honor.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well,
i
think
that
they
clearly
made
an
assumption
that
she
had
a
separately
protectable
interest
in
this
car,
for
which--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--yes,
i
would
say--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--again,
i
would
analogize
it
to
a
tenancy
in
common.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
she
had
the
interest
that
one
joint
owner
in
a
tenancy
in
common
would
have,
or
one
tenant.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
no,
justice
ginsburg,
we're
not
contending
that
the
state
has
no
power
to
forfeit
the
vehicle.
what
we
are
saying
is
they
cannot
do
so
without
compensating
tina
bennis,
the
innocent
owner,
for
her
interest.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well,
i
would...
we
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
so-called
administrative
expenses,
attorney's
fees,
prosecutorial
attorney
fees
and
court
costs,
detroit
police
costs,
are
not
properly
assessable
against
her
interest,
that
that...
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that
it
is
improper
to
assess
those
costs
against
her--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
the
court...
the
court
certainly
exceeded
traditional
notions
of
what
constitutes
a
public
nuisance.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
find
that
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
i
only
hesitated
because
the
michigan
supreme
court
applied
an
extremely
novel
interpretation
of
nuisance
law,
but
i
don't
want
to
be
sidetracked
on
that
issue,
because
the
focus
here
is
on
the
forfeitability
of
her
interest
in
the
car.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
yes,
it
is,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
your
honor,
i
guess
that
gest
into
the
issue
of
whether
pre-hearing
seizure
is
appropriate,
which
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
assuming
that
prehearing
seizure,
which
is
what
was
accomplished
here,
is
appropriate,
i
don't
know
that
she
would
have
a
claim
for
the
loss
of
use
of
the
vehicle
in
that
interim
period,
if
that
is
your
question.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
question,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
that's
the
position
that
we're
taking
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
that
is
correct,
justice--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--it
was
a
pontiac
sedan.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well,
presumptively
it
would
be
50
percent
of
the
resale
value
of
the
car.
i
believe
the
car
was
purchased
approximately...
the
record
will
show
that
it
was
purchased
approximately
1
month
before
the
forfeiture,
and
she
did
testify
that
she
provided
most
of
the
purchase
money
for
the
car,
that
there
may
be
an
opportunity
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
50
percent--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--$600.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
yes,
at
least
$300.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well,
your
honor,
there
are...
we
propose
a
standard
for
defining
innocence
that
we
term
the
negligent
entrustment
standard,
which
focuses
on
whether
the
owner
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
impending
illegal
use.
the
solicitor
general
has
proposed
an
alternative
standard.
we
contend
that
she
would
prevail
under
either
standard,
either
the
all
reasonable
steps
standard
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general,
or
the
negligent
entrustment
standard,
which
focuses
on
whether
the
owner
knew
or
had
reason
to
know
of
the
illegal
use.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well,
i
think
the
standard
that
we
advocate--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--not
post
entrustment,
your
honor.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
but
if
the
time
of
entrustment
is
deemed
to
be
the
time--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--i
agree
that
after
the
creation
of
the
joint
property
interest
there
formally
can
be
no
entrustment.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
that's
correct.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
are
we
assuming--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i'd
just
like
to
digress
briefly
that
the
focus--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--is
on
the
time
of
entrustment,
which
in
a
joint
ownership
situation
i
think
would
be
deemed
the
time
the
joint
property
interest
is
created.
now--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--yes.
i
think
if
she
knew
of
the
impending
illegal
use
at
that
time.
now,
post
entrustment--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it
should
be
specific
to
the
illegal
use--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--that
gives
rise
to
the
forfeiture
under
the
statute.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
no,
to
the
contrary.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
certainly
that's
true
in
this
case--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--because
the
record
shows
that
there
is
no
knowledge
at
any
time
up
until
the
time
of
illegal
use,
but
i...
you
know,
the
court
could
pose
cases,
hypotheticals--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--that
if
somebody
acquired
knowledge
after
entrustment--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--i
would
think
it
can
be
taken.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well,
if
she
had--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--it
could
well
be,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
i
guess
it
depends
on
how
good
a
bargain
they
struck
initially,
your
honor,
but
certainly
that
$600
is
evidence
of
its
value.
i
don't
know
that
it's
conclusive
evidence,
that
perhaps--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
i
guess
what
i
was
referring
to
there,
your
honor,
is
i
think
in
a
tenancy
in
common
situation,
which
i
analogize
this
to,
there's
a
presumption--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--because
i
don't
believe
there
are
rights
of
survivorship
that
attach
under
the
michigan
automobile
registration
statute.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well,
i
think
the
court
has
taken
for
granted
the
constitutionality
of
the
co-called
civil
liability
statutes
for
automobile
owners.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
it's
different
in
two
critical
respects,
justice
kennedy.
first,
such
statutes
arise
in
the
tort
system,
and
are
designed
not
to
punish
but
simply
to
shift
losses
so
as
to
facilitate
recoveries,
tort
recoveries
by
plaintiffs
to
compensate
for
injury.
second,
and
perhaps
most
important,
generally
speaking,
the
state
would
not
be
the
plaintiff
in
such
an
action,
and
the
full
machinery
of
the
state
with
its
potential
for
oppression
is
not
arrayed
against
the
individual.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
the
liability
is
greater,
your
honor,
and
there
is
state
action,
the
kind
recognized
in
shelley
v.
kraemer
and
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
but
i
think
that
that
is
really
a...
this
type
of
state
action
is
quite
a
bit
different.
i
mean,
a
civil
law...
providing
a
forum
in
the
way
of
a
civil
lawsuit,
providing
a
forum
for
private
parties
to--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
again,
i'd
emphasize,
your
honor,
that
that
statute
does
not
impose
punishment,
and
more
importantly--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--and
the
state
is
not
benefiting
in
a
pecuniary
sense.
the
full
power
and
machinery
of
the
state
is
not
being
arrayed
against
an
individual.
now,
in
the
vicarious
liability--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
court...
the
court
took
an
opportunity
in
austin
two
terms
ago
to
begin
to
decrease
reliance
on
the
so-called
guilty
property
fiction
that
is
associated
with
that,
and
i
think
the
court
should
continue
to
deemphasize
reliance
on
that
antiquated
notion.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
no,
justice
kennedy,
not
necessarily.
i
think
classic
in
rem
forfeiture,
as
indicated
in
the
brief,
arose
in
the
admiralty
and
customs
area,
and
it
arose
because
of
a
difficulty
in
obtaining
in
personam
jurisdiction
over,
say,
owners
of
vessels.
in
order
for
the
government
to
satisfy
claims
against
vessel
owners--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--if
the
owner
was
a...
was
not
a
united
states
national,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
a
practicable--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--i'm
sorry--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well,
that's
the
guilty
property
fiction.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
yes,
the
idea
that
an
inanimate
object
can...
you
can
ascribe
guilt
to
an
inanimate
object,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
i
think
it's
a...
it
is
a...
it's
a
rather
obsolete
notion.
it's
one
that
is...
it's
a
convenient
rationale
for
use
of
the
civil
forfeiture
power,
and
i
suggested
that--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--the
deodand?
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
yes.
yes,
we
did
say
that
about
the
deodand.
in
fact,
we...
i
guess
we...
what
the
court
said
in
austin
was
that
the
deodand,
which
actually
was
rejected
by
the
english
parliament,
i
believe,
by
an
act
in
1846,
did
not
take
hold
here,
and
what
instead,
this...
the
practice
here
has
really
derived
from
the
english
navigation
statutes,
and
once
again
the
law
review
literature,
the
historical
literature
suggests
that
those
english
navigation
acts
were
based
on
the
difficulty
in
obtaining
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
owners,
the...
and
cargo
and
in
some
cases
ships
were
seized
to
satisfy
claims
arising
out
of
customs
violations.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well,
the...
your
honor--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--the
state
has
a...
the
automobile's
registration
and
titling
of
automobiles
is
heavily
regulated.
we
actually
use
paper
title
in...
i
believe
in
every
state
for
car
ownership.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
your
honor,
i
don't
accept
the
analogy
because
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
there
are
other
remedies
available
to
the
state.
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
state
pursued
a
separate
criminal
action
against
john
bennis.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
if
the
assumption
of
your
hypothetical
is
that
the
co-owner
neither
knew
nor
should
have
known
of
the
illegal
use--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
or
used
for
some
illegal
purpose.
i
want
to
emphasize,
however,
that
it...
my
standard
does
not
address
the
forfeitability
of
proceeds
realized
from
illegal
activity.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
justice
o'connor,
the
court
in
calero-toledo
did
reach
the
facial
challenge.
it
rejected
the
facial
challenge
to
the
puerto
rican
statute,
but
the
court
never
decided
whether
the
yacht
owner
did
or
did
not
satisfy
the
negligence
prong
of
the
dicta,
and
you're
asking
me...
i
don't
know
that
there
was
enough
of
a
factual
development
in
that
case
to
really
answer
your
question.
the--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--they
did,
but
there
is
a
bit
of
an
ambiguity
in
the
court's
resolution
of
the
as-applied
challenge,
assuming
that
there
was
an
as-applied
challenge--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
if
the
facts
were
that
at
the
time
of
entrustment
the
yacht
leasing
company--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--neither
knew
nor
should
have
known--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--yes.
i
think
it
was
justice
douglas'
dissent
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
it
was
two
marijuana
cigarettes.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
that's
correct.
[laughter]
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there's
the
sense
in
which
there
was
a
procedural
default
in
that
case,
because
they--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
the
court
did
a
rather
lengthy
historical
analysis
of
deodands,
but
i
think,
your
honor,
what's
critical
here
is
that
the
court
in
austin
did
its
own
historical
analysis
and
concluded
that
forfeiture
has
traditionally
served,
at
least
in
part,
as
punishment
for
personal
culpability,
and
i
think
that
that
history--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--in
any
context?
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
limited
to
the
forfeiture
context,
or
outside?
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
well--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
it's
really
a
species
of
vicarious
punitive
liability
that
we're
talking
about
here,
and
not
just
strict
liability,
justice
scalia,
and
vicarious
liability,
punitive
liability,
vicarious
criminal
liability,
it
is...
has
very
narrow...
occupies
a
very
narrow
niche
in
our
legal
tradition.
now,
in
the
corporate
area--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
in
the
corporate
area,
i
think
in
a
case
called
new
york
central
the
court
did
recognize
that
a
corporation,
which
after
all
can
only
speak
through
its
agents,
it
can
only
speak
and
think
through
its
agents,
can
be
liable,
and
some
have
regarded
that
as
a
form
of
vicarious
criminal
liability,
but
vicarious
criminal
liability
outside
the
corporate
context
is
exceedingly
rare
in
our
jurisprudence.
it--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--i
think
we
have
to
view
it
as
punitive
the
sanction
as
punitive.
the
austin
decision
makes
that
absolutely
clear.
the
sanction
of
forfeiture
is
punitive,
and
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
in
one
1958
plymouth
sedan,
which
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
applied
to
civil
forfeiture
proceedings,
and
united
states
coin
&
currency,
which
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
applies
to
forfeiture,
have
treated
forfeiture
as
criminal,
or
quasicriminal,
so
i
think--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--i
don't
think
we
should--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--your
honor,
the...
if
this
is
a
presumptive
taking
under
the
takings
clause,
as
we
contend
it
is,
then
as
a
matter
of
straightforward
constitutional
analysis
the
burden
of
proving
any
exception
to
the
requirement
to
pay
compensation
would
have
to
lie
with
the
state.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
i'm
sorry--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--oh,
i
think
at
the
time
of
entrustment--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--or
if
it's
a
case
of
solely
owned
property
simply
being
loaned,
that
would
be
the--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
certainly--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--certainly,
and
that's
why
at
the
time
of
entrustment
i...
i
mean,
at
the
time
of
the
creation
of
the
joint
property
interest
one
can
say
there's...
there
may
an
element
of
control
over
whether
you
had--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--you're
postulating
that
she
would
have
a
remedy
in
a
court
of
law
against--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--well,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
hardly
reasonable,
after
tina
bennis,
an
innocent
owner,
has
been
punished
by
having
her
property
interest
confiscated--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--to
then
tell
her
that--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--her
remedy
is
to
go
into
a
court
of
law
and
sue
her
husband.
at
that
point,
you're
in
the
realm
of
divorce,
but
when
you're
talking
about
a
wife
bringing
an
action--
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
--against
a...
excuse
me?
mr.
stefan
b.
herpel
thank
you.
