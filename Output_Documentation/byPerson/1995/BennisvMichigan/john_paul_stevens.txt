justice
stevens
well,
didn't
we
say
in
austin
that
never
took
hold
in
the
united
states?
that
was
an
english
fiction.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
am
i
correct
in
assuming,
mr.
roberts,
that
your
position
on
the
constitutional
issue
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
she
was
the
sole
owner
of
the
vehicle?
justice
stevens
so
we
really
don't
need
to
worry
about
this
half-ownership
business,
do
we,
in
your
view
of
the
case?
justice
stevens
can
you
point
to
the
language--
--but
again,
i
want
to
be
sure
your
position
is
the
same.
if
she
owned
the
car
100
percent--
justice
stevens
--you
could
still
forfeit
it?
justice
stevens
well,
is
that
a
passage
in
the
opinion
in
this
case,
or
another
case?
justice
stevens
in
this
case.
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
yes,
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
saying.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
these
questions
we're
raising
go
to
questions
of
the
application
of
michigan
law
rather
than
the
ultimate
constitutional
issue,
and
i'm
curious
to
know
whether
you
think
there's
a
difference
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
between
an
owner
such
as
a
wife
giving
the
car
to
her
husband
and
a
theft
of
the
car.
in
either
event,
the
person
doesn't
have
control
of
what
happened
in
the
car.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
could
a
stolen
car
be
forfeited
if
the
police
catch
someone
with
marijuana
in
the
car,
or
engaged
in
an
act
of
prostitution?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
asking
about
what
michigan
would
do.
i'm
asking
about
your
constitutional
theory.
we
have
a
constitutional
question
to
decide.
do
you
think,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
michigan
would
have
the
right
to
forfeit
stolen
vehicles
when
they
are
found
to
be
used
in
an
illicit
manner?
justice
stevens
but
what
do
you
think
the
answer
is?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
this
just
doesn't
involve
vehicles,
it
could
involve
houses,
couldn't
it,
too?
justice
stevens
if
a
family
found
out
that
one
of
their
children
had
smoked
marijuana
at
home,
could
they
forfeit
the
house?
justice
stevens
if
the
parents...
i
mean,
say
the
state
found
out
that
a
teenager
in
a
house
had
smoked
marijuana
in
the
house,
could
they--
justice
stevens
--that
would
not
be
a
nuisance,
and
the
home
would
not
be
forfeitable?
justice
stevens
and
in
terms
of
the
federal
constitution,
if
michigan
can
do
this,
why
couldn't
it
forfeit
a
house
in
which
there
was...
they
found
out
that
marijuana
had
been
smoked
on
one
occasion?
justice
stevens
but
why
does
it
have
to
be
just
a
mobile
home?
why
not
a
mansion?
justice
stevens
it
could
be.
justice
stevens
and
constitutionally
it
would
be
the
same
case
if
instead
of
$300
it
was
a
$40,000
car,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
would
it
have
been
a
different
case,
in
your
view,
if
she
had
gotten
on
the
witness
stand
and
said,
this
all
came
as
a
very
shocking
surprise
to
me,
i
had
no
idea
this
was
going
on?
justice
stevens
that
would
be
the
difference.
