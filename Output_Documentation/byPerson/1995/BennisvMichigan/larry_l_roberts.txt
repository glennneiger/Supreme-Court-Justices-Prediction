mr.
larry
l.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would,
if
you
would
allow
me,
like
to
go
through
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked,
because
i
think
those
questions,
at
least
in
my
opinion,
encompass
the
position
that
the
state
of
michigan
has
brought
in
this
case.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
the
record,
justice
o'connor,
does
not
indicate,
as
mr.
herpel
indicated
to
the
court,
exactly
what
this
is,
but
in
my
understanding
of
the
law
of
michigan,
as
we
can
see,
i
think,
from
the
record
presented,
when
there's
a
vehicle
co-owned
by
a
husband
and
wife,
in
order
to
dispose
of
that,
for
example,
at
sale,
private
sale,
both
individuals
have
to
sign
the
title
to
do
that.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
yes,
i
believe
they
could
under
michigan
law,
in
this
situation,
yes.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
that's
correct,
because
of
the
liability
of
ownership
of
the
vehicle
in
the
state
of
michigan
under
our
laws
and
the
way
they've
been
interpreted
puts
upon
each
owner
liability
for
the
use
or
negligence
or
misuse
of
that
vehicle.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
i
have
a
citation
to
the
statute
that
was
referred
to
by,
i
believe
it
was
justice
scalia.
mcl
257.401,
and
that's
mentioned
in
our
brief.
that
is
the
liability
statute
for
michigan
motor
vehicles,
whereby
if
an
individual
is
entrusted
with
your
vehicle
and
commits
an
injury
upon
another,
you
as
an
owner
or
a
co-owner,
innocent
or
otherwise,
may
be
held
liable
for
any
of
the
injuries
or
damages--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--they
can
levy
on
the
automobile,
justice
kennedy,
but
i'm
not
certain
how
the
proceedings
would
apply
as
to
her
interest,
but
what
we're
concerned
with
here--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--i'm...
that...
i'm
not
certain
as
to
what
the
answer
is
to
that,
but
we're
getting,
i
think,
beyond
the
facts
that
we
have
presented
here,
where
we're
concerned
with
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
michigan
in
a
nuisance
context
in
regards
to
mrs.
bennis'--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--yes,
it
would.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
i...
i
would
not
say
that
we
would
not
have
to
worry
about
it.
i
think
we're
concerned
with
it
because
we're
here
today.
i
think
we
should
be
concerned,
because
we
have
to
reaffirm,
i
believe,
the
police
powers
of
the
state
in
this
type
of
nuisance--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--that's
correct.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
control--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--that's
correct.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
control
in...
that's
true,
as
justice
stevens
and
justice--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--that
may...
that
is
part
of
the
theory.
the
object--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--well,
the
object
is
the
method
whereby
the
nuisance
conduct
was
committed.
the
statute,
the
police
power
statute,
the
nuisance
or
abatement
law
aims
at
the
use
of
an
item,
be
it
a
building,
a
boat,
an
aircraft,
a
place...
even
place
is
named--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--and
as
an
individual
committing
certain
types
of
conduct,
which
is
the
nuisance,
in
that--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--a
guilty
object
in
the
sense
that
the
conduct
that
the
law
is
aimed
at
abating
was
committed
with
the
use
of
that,
be
it
in
or...
the
vehicle
perhaps
takes,
taking
an
individual--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--then
that
would
be
outside
the
scope
of
this,
and
that
was
mentioned
in
the
michigan
supreme
court
opinion
in
this
matter.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
again,
then
we
would
get
to
the
point
of
control.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
car
rental.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
the
state
would
take
the
car,
but
would
not
be
able
to
forfeit
the
car--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--the
distinction
is
made
at
the
stage
whereby
it's
determined
that
the
car
is
a
rental
car
that
the
rental
company
had
no
control
over,
nor
could
they
have
been
party
to--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--but
in
this
situation,
i'm
talking
about
an
application
of
the
law
to
a
situation
that
is
outside
the
scope
of
a
husband
or
a
wife
being
a
co-owner--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--control
is
relevant
only
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
we
have
to
think
is
aimed
at
the
strict
liability
of
those
who
own
a
motor
vehicle,
so
ownership
and
control
are
relevant
in
that
sense,
and--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--that's
correct,
but
they
have
no
control
over
its
use.
once
it
goes
away,
there's
no
way
that
they
can
find
out
or--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--that's
correct.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
because
she
could...
although
perhaps
far-fetched...
indicate
to
the
other
person
using
the
car...
perhaps
she
loaned
the
car
to
an
individual.
she
could
say--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--i
understand.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
i
understand.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
because
she
doesn't
have
the
control
over
the
car
that
they
do
in
the
sense--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--they've
indicated
that
in
the
opinion.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
yes.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
i
don't
have
the
exact
page
in
there.
i'm
indicating
that
i
think
the
interpretation
of
the
opinion
would
be
that
that's
exactly
the
situation.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
correct.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
it
could
be
liable--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--right.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
certainly,
justice.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
no.
i
was
indicating
that
i
feel
from
reading
the
supreme
court
opinion
you
can
deduce
that
that's
what
they--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
but
i'm
not...
i...
they
did
not
specifically--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--go
through
all
the
possible
situations,
because
they
were
saying
this
is
a
police
power
matter.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
it
would
be
liable
to
come
into
the
forfeiture
proceedings.
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
forfeited,
no,
because
of
the--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--i
think
that
that's
possible.
i
don't
have
that...
i
did
not
address
that
in
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
there's
a
case...
chicago,
burlington,
&
quincy
was
mentioned
in
our
brief,
and
in
that
case,
as
the
court
is
aware,
there
is
an
absolute
duty
on
the
railroad
carrier
to
comply
with
the
safety
appliances
act,
and
in
that
case,
as
i
recall
reading,
the
railroad
carrier
put
forth
that
he
had
done...
he
wasn't
aware
that
the
cars
were
out
of
repair,
he'd
done
everything
reasonable
to
comply,
and
yet
he
was
held
responsible
for
the
violation--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--your--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--well--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--if
i
could,
i'd
address
some
of
the
assumptions
in
the
hypothet,
that
there
is
a
punishment,
and
there
was
punishment
for
a
criminal
offense.
mrs.
bennis...
first
of
all,
we
maintain
if
there
was
punishment,
it
was
incidental
to
the
regulatory
aim
of
this
police
power,
and
the
criminal
offense
was
committed
by
her
husband,
not
mrs.
bennis.
she
is
subject
to
the
civil
liability
of
this
civil
law
when
it's
applied
properly
with
due
process
simply
because
she's
an
owner
of
the
vehicle
and
gave
permission
or
did
not
give
permission
to
use
the
vehicle.
that's
why
in
this
situation
an
individual
can
be
held
liable
for
the
acts
of
another
in
the
use
of
the
vehicle
as
long
as
all
the
constitutional
protections
have
been
given
them,
and
here
we
had
a
court
of
equity
which
by
the
record
shows
that
she
was
afforded
all
those
protections.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
we
maintain
it
is,
justice
o'connor,
yes.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
civil--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--it
is
a
public
nuisance
abatement,
but
the
penalty
is--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--the
car
is
the
vehicle
that
was
used
to
perpetuate
the
condition.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
under
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
way
it's
been
interpreted,
yes,
because
buildings
have
been
found--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--in
this
situation,
as
the
record
reveals
and
the
transcript
shows,
there
were
several
witnesses
that
testified
that
the
ongoing
situation
of
nuisance,
the
prostitution
activities
in
this
neighborhood
were
such
that
when
this
individual
utilized
this
vehicle
to
commit
further
acts
of
prostitution
or
lewdness
or
assignation,
he
and
the
vehicle
were
committing
the
nuisance
conduct.
the
vehicle
was
the
container,
if
you
want
to...
if
i
could
use
that
word,
i
did
not
use
it
in
the
brief,
and
the
conduct
was
committed
by
mr.
bennis
and
the
prostitute,
and
we
have
a
record
of
the
ongoing
conduct,
so
that
we
do
have
that.
there's
not
an
indication
that
this
vehicle
was
used
more
than
one--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--we
are
maintaining
in
this
situation,
with
michigan's
nuisance
abatement
law,
a
civil
penalty,
if
you
wish
to
call
it
a
penalty,
and
it
is
in
that
sense--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--it
is.
it
is
in
that
sense,
because
the
condition,
the
use
of
the
vehicle
to
perpetuate
the
condition--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--because
of
the
applicable--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
the
strict
liability
of
the
law
interpretation.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
civil.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
this
proceeding,
of
course--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--this
proceeding...
no.
this
proceeding
was
a
civil
proceeding,
so
that
the
final
order
and
judgment
controls.
the
court
speaks
of
its
order.
the
order
here--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--i'm
sorry,
what
was
your
last
word,
justice
ginsburg?
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
he
did.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
correct,
a
1978
oldsmobile.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
there
was
more
to
what
he
also
said
when
he
made
that
statement,
and
that
was
that
in
this
particular
case,
because
part
of
the
statute
allows
for
deduction
of
costs
and
expenses,
after
doing
so
for
tina
bennis'
[dollar]
300
interest
in
the
vehicle,
there
would
be
practically
nothing
left,
and
then
he
looked
to
these
other
equitable
considerations
and
said,
in
this
situation
i
am
treating
it
thusly.
other
sicuations,
as
the
record
shows,
he
indicated--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--if
it
were
a
building
at
issue
in
the
case?
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
yes,
it
would.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
we
could
seek
to
abate
the
nuisance,
yes.
it
does
not
stop
us.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
the
law
encompasses
buildings,
motor
vehicles,
aircraft--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--if
the
family
found
out?
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
could
we?
no.
no,
and
the
michigan
criminal
laws
would
first
be
applied,
i
think,
to
that
situation,
and
they're
such
that
the
nuisance
abatement
laws
and
the
forfeiture
law--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--there
was
a
controlled
substances
amendment
put
into
this
nuisance
abatement
law
in
1988,
but
no,
i
think
that
would
come
into
the
prosecutorial
discretion
area.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
he
indicated--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--no.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
we
maintain
in
the
michigan
supreme
court
they
could,
but
they
ruled
that
we
needed,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
a
continuing
condition.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
the
mobile
home
and
the
body
shop
in
austin,
they
sought
to
do
that,
did
they
not,
and
there
was
just--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--it
could
be.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
under
this
law,
that
would
not
happen.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
we
read
it
not
as
that
way,
but
the
michigan
supreme
court--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--right.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
not
that
i'm
aware
of
at
this
point,
no.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
that's
correct.
the
value
is
not
it,
it's
the
use
that
we're
aiming
at,
and
as
with
pearson
yacht,
that
was
two
marijuana
cigarettes.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
no.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
but
under
the
michigan
law,
we
would
not
be
able
to
proceed
that
way.
under
federal
law,
i
think
you
might
be
able
to.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
instrumentality--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--whether--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--well,
that's
not
a
record
we
have
exactly
here,
but
i
understand--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--the
powers
of
the
state
allow
them
to
go
after
all
matters
which
encompass
public
safety,
health,
and
morals.
nuisance
conditions
clearly
fall
within
that,
and
if
there
is,
in
the
state,
and
has
been
sustained
by
cases,
laws
that
allow
strict
liability
for
ownership
of
vehicles
and
the
vehicles
utilized
in
nuisance
conduct,
we
can
proceed
the
way
we
did
as
long
as
the
constitutional
protections--
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
--i
think
it
should,
yes.
mr.
larry
l.
roberts
thank
you.
