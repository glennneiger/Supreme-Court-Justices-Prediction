justice
souter
well,
let's
assume
the
standard
is
negligence,
what
could
she
have
done...
what
if
she
knew
in
this
case
that
her
husband
was
likely
to
resort
to
prostitutes
using
the
car,
would
she
have
had
a
right
to
stop
him
from
using
it?
justice
souter
well,
would
she
have
had
a
right
to
stop
him
from
using
it?
justice
souter
well,
she
didn't
have
to
entrust
it.
it's
half
his
car.
justice
souter
why
is
there
an
entrustment?
he's
half
an
owner.
justice
souter
okay.
let's
assume
we're
at
that
point,
and
she
finds
out
that
he's
doing
these
things
on
the
way
home,
she
would
have
had
no
right
to
stop
him
from
using
the
car,
would
she?
justice
souter
what
should
she
have
done
in
order
to
satisfy
a
negligence
standard?
should
she
have
called
the
police
and
said,
look
out
for
this
car,
my
husband
may
be
doing
bad
things
in
it?
[laughter]
well,
i
mean--
justice
souter
--i...
if
we're
going
to
have
a
negligence
standard,
does...
how
would
it
be
applied
here?
justice
souter
briefly.
justice
souter
all
right,
but
in
any
case,
in
this
case
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
she
knew
at
the
time
the
purchase...
the
car
was
purchased
that
he
might
use
it
in
this
fashion?
justice
souter
so
your
position
is
going
to
be,
if
you
win
this
case,
that
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
that
there's
no
evidence
of
negligence
at
that
time,
and
therefore
what
she
may
have
learned,
even
if
she
had
known
post
purchase,
would
be
irrelevant,
and
that
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
she's
entitled
to
her
50
percent
share.
justice
souter
yes.
justice
souter
right.
justice
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
different
question?
let's
assume
that
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
she
knew,
but
she
was
not
putting
up
any
of
the
money
and
he
simply
said,
i'm
buying
this
car,
and
i
want
the
title
issued
and
so
on,
the
registration
issued
to
my
wife
and
to
me,
and
he
says
to
her,
you
have
a
half
interest
in
the
car,
can
that
half
interest
be
taken
from
her
on
the
assumption
that
she
knew
at
that
time
what
he
was
likely
to
do
with
the
car?
justice
souter
what
should
she
have
done?
she
had
no
role
in
the
purchase
of
the
car,
and
she
had
no
role
in
the
transfer
of
a
50-percent
interest
to
her.
justice
souter
well--
--as
i
understand
it,
you
wouldn't...
you
don't
agree
that
mere
knowledge
would
be
enough
anyway--
justice
souter
--do
you?
you
don't
agree
that
mere
knowledge
by
one
spouse
that
the
other
was
going
to
use
or
was
using
the
vehicle
in
a
way
here
that
would
constitute
a
nuisance
would
be
sufficient
fault.
justice
souter
you're
saying
it
has
to
be
knowledge
at
the
time
they
bought
the
car.
justice
souter
oh,
but
that's
case
in
which
there's
a
right
of
control.
the
problem
comes
because
there's
no
right
of
control
here.
justice
souter
i
presume
there
is
none--
justice
souter
--under
michigan
law.
justice
souter
yes,
but
you
say
they're
the
same
even
if
she
owned
the
car.
justice
souter
so
your
position
doesn't
rest
on
the
right
to
control
the
car.
justice
souter
i
mean,
if
she
were
the
sole
owner,
presumably
she
has
a
right
to
control
its
use.
justice
souter
if
she
is
simply
a
common
owner
as
against
the
other
common
owner,
i
assume
she
does
not
have
any
right
to
control.
justice
souter
what
else?
justice
souter
well,
that's
what
makes
it
a
nuisance.
justice
souter
right,
but
you're
saying
once
the
object
has
been
used
to
create
the
nuisance,
your
right
to
require...
your
right
to
go
after
it
on
a
forfeiture
proceeding
rests,
in
essence,
on
the
theory
that
it
is
a
guilty
object
in
the
old
common
law
sense,
the
deodand
sense.
justice
souter
no,
but
i
want
to
know
what
the
theory...
and
this
is...
justice
o'connor
was...
what
is
the
theory
of
the
state's
right
to
forfeit,
and
a
moment
ago,
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
said
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
whether
the
so-called
innocent
claimant
has
a
right
to
control
or
not,
and
now
you
are
saying,
i
think,
that
it
does
depend
on
the
right
to
control,
because
the
answer
is
different
in
the
case
of
the
stolen
car,
and
the
answer
is
different
in
the
case
of
the
rental
car.
is
control
relevant,
or
isn't
it?
justice
souter
then
why
shouldn't
the
wife
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
car
renter,
or
the
person
from
whom
the
car
was
stolen?
justice
souter
she
didn't
lend
it
to
her
husband.
he
owns
half
of
it.
justice
souter
he
has
the
right
to
drive
it.
justice
souter
she
has...
as
i
understand
it,
she
has
no
right
of
control.
why,
therefore,
isn't
she
in
the
same
position
as
the
renter
or
the
victim
of
the
theft?
justice
souter
why
not?
only
because
there's
a
specific
exception
saying...
built
into
the
michigan
statute
saying
this
is
not
forfeitable
for
one
puff.
justice
souter
in
any
case,
there's
a
bar
in
michigan
law.
justice
souter
but
there's
no
constitutional
bar.
justice
souter
so
if
the...
going
back
to
the
argument
that
counsel
on
the
other
side
made,
if
the
co-owner
did
not
know
at
the
time
of
acquiring
ownership
that
the
property
was
likely
to
be
used
by
the
other
co-owner
for
a
criminal
purpose,
and
subsequently
learns
it,
there
would
be
no
right
of
control
at
that
point.
there
would
be
no
fault,
and
it
would
not
be
forfeitable.
the
co-owner's
interest,
the
innocent
co-owner's
interest
would
not
be
forfeitable,
on
your
theory.
justice
souter
let's
see
where
we
would
go
with
it.
take
the
easy
case
in
which
she
says,
yes,
i
knew
he
was
doing
this.
there
wasn't
anything
i
could
do
about
it.
he
owns
as
much
of
the
car
as
i
do.
what
was
she
supposed
to
do?
in
that...
i
take
it
in
your
view,
her
interest
would
be
subject
to
forfeiture
on
those
facts,
based
on
that
testimony,
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
well,
no,
i'm
talking
about
my
case,
the
one
in
which
she
takes
the
stand
and
says,
i
knew
he
was
doing
it,
but
i
didn't
have
any
right
to
stop
him
from
using
the
car,
and
let's
further
assume
that
as
a
co-owner
in
michigan,
she
didn't.
justice
souter
well,
is
right
to
control
the
touchstone
for
determining
what
is
reasonable?
justice
souter
okay.
you're
not
taking
the
position,
say,
in
the
case
that
i
put...
the
wife
says
i
knew,
and
so
on...
you're
not
taking
the
position
that
she
was
supposed
to
call
the
police
and
say,
you
better
watch
out
for
such-and-such
a
car,
because
my
husband
is
engaging
in
illegal
acts
in
it.
you're
not
taking
that
position,
are
you,
or
are
you?
justice
souter
well,
you're
not
taking
the
position
that
she
affirmatively
had
to
call
the
police.
now,
you're
saying
that
control
is
very
significant.
what
else
is?
what's
in
the
middle
between
these
two
extremes?
justice
souter
but
that
gets
us
back
to
the
control
issue.
she...
on
my
hypothesis,
she
knows
beyond
a
peradventure
of
a
doubt,
but
she
can't
control
the
car,
and
you...
i
think
you're
saying
she
is
not
required
to
call
the
police.
what
else
should
we
look
at
to
determine
whether
she
has
taken
every
reasonable
step
to
preserve
her
innocence
for
constitutional
purposes?
