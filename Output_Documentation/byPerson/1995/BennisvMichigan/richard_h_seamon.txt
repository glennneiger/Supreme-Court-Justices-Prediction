mr.
richard
h.
seamon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
discussing
some
of
the
issues
that
i
believe
complicate
what's
already
a
difficult
constitutional
question.
the
first
issue
has
to
do
with
precisely
what
rights
co-owners
have
to
control
the
property's
use
by
other
co-owners.
that
is
not
clear,
and
in
our
view,
the
issue
of
control
is
highly
relevant
under
the
all
reasonable
steps
standard
that
we
propose.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct,
at
that
point
in
time,
although
we
don't
agree
with
the
petitioner's
suggestion
of
a
negligent
entrustment
standard,
because
we
think
that
it's
unrealistic
to
focus
simply
on
the
point
in
time
at
which
the
property
is
transferred
from
one
owner
to
another
or
the
time
at
which
the
co-owner's
property
interest
arises.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
precise
formulation--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--the
precise
formulation
comes
from
the
suggestion
in
calero-toledo.
the--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--no,
it's
not
enough,
and
we
don't
believe
that
that's
all
that
supports
the
all
reasonable
steps
standard.
both...
the
history
supports
the
broad
principle,
in
fact,
that
limits
the
government's
ability
to
punish
essentially
blameless
people
by
taking
away
their
property.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right,
and
even
as
long
ago,
however,
as
a
case
like
peisch
v.
ware,
chief
justice
marshall
wrote
for
the
court
in
1808
that
a
property
should
not
be
forfeited
when
the
owner
of
the
property
lacks
the
means
to
prevent
the
forfeiture.
now,
that
suggestion
of
powerlessness
to
control
the
events
leading
to
the
forfeiture
is
different
from
the
later
formulation
in
calero-toledo,
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--he
was
not
speaking
of--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--he
was
speaking
in
terms
of
longstanding
principles.
it's
not--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right,
and
we
see
two
lines
of
cases,
really,
one
of
which
includes
goldsmith,
grant,
van
oster,
and
calero-toledo
itself,
which
recognizes
that
a
property
owner
cannot
avoid
the
forfeiture
of
property
that's
been
used
illegally
merely
by
showing
that
she
lacked
knowledge
or
even
reason
to
know
of
the
illegal
use.
by
the
same
token,
there
is
another
different
line
of
cases,
of
which
calero-toledo
is
also
a
part,
that
recognizes
limitations
on
the
government's
ability
to
punish
people.
now,
that
actually
brings--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct.
this
court--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
is
a
significant
distinction.
the
one
exception
i
would
note
to
that,
but
it's
not
a
forfeiture
case,
is
the
one
we
cite
in
our
brief,
southwestern
telephone
&
telegraph
company
v.
danaher,
which
involved
the
court...
in
which
the
court
set
aside
a
$6,300
civil
penalty
against
a
phone
company
on
the
grounds
that
the
phone
company
had
acted
reasonably
and
there
was
no
wrongdoing
that
justified--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
may
be
that--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--our
view
of
the
result,
i
suppose,
is
in
part
based
on
presumptions
about
how
the
state
law
operates
in
terms
of
the
degree
of
control
that
a
joint
owner
can
exercise
over
another
owner.
certainly,
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
expect
a
co-owner
to
do
anything
that
she
didn't
have
a
right
to
do
under
the
state
law.
on
the
other
hand,
every
citizen
can
take
certain
measures
to
prevent
illegal
activity
that
comes...
that
they
learn
about,
including
calling
the
police,
and
so
it's
simply
not
clear--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it's
very
difficult
to
know
in
the
absence
of
knowing
more
about
how
much
knowledge
or
reason
to
suspect
that
use
she
had,
which
is
unclear
to
us
on
this
record.
in
our
view,
all
that
she
showed
in
the
trial
court
was
that
she
lacked
actual
knowledge
of
the
illegal
use,
but
she
did
not
show
that
she
lacked
a
reason
to
suspect
that--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
but
i
would
emphasize
in
answering
the
question
that
it
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
offense
involved
here,
which
is
i
think
another
complication.
i
mean,
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
a
husband
who
frequents
prostitutes
will
hide
that
fact
from
his
wife
and
be
able
to
do
that
successfully,
but
that
may
not
necessarily
be
true
if
a
different
offense
is
involved,
such
as
ongoing
drug
trafficking,
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
we
believe
that
the
record,
in
fact,
is
unclear
on
the
question
of
whether
she
could
have
taken
any
reasonable
steps
to
prevent--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--our
view
of
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
is
based--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--no,
i'm
sorry,
that's
not
our
position.
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
an
owner
has
knowledge
of
ongoing
unlawful
activity
with
regard
to
her
own
property,
it
still
remains...
can
make
out
the
defense
by
showing
that
she
took
all
reasonable
steps
to
prevent
it.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
certainly
is
one
of
the
foundations.
anything
that
one
doesn't
have
a
right
to
do--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--no,
not
exactly.
our
position
is...
it
is
not
our
position
that
if
you
know,
you
lose.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--well,
i'd
say
there
are
two
elements.
besides
control,
the
other
element
is
the
extent
to
which
the
person
knows
or
has
reason
to
know
that
her
property
is
being
used
illegally.
i
mean,
it
is
true
that
in--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--on
that
point,
i...
we
would
expect
property
owners
to
notify
the
police
if
they
know
that
the
property
is
being--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--not
in
every
case,
but
it
is
certainly
one--
[laughter]
it
is
certainly
one--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--thank
you.
one,
what's
reasonable
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
every
case,
and
it's
easier
to
understand
my
answer,
i
think,
in
the
fact
situation
that
comes
up
all
too
frequently,
i'm
sorry
to
say,
in
federal
cases
where
the
husband
is
dealing
drugs,
using
the
car
or
the
house
to
deal
the
drugs,
and
the
wife
has
knowledge
of
that,
and
in
those
cases
the
federal
government
does
indeed
take
the
position
that
the
wife
is
obligated,
in
order
to
protect
her
property
interests,
in
order
to
be
able
to
assert
an
innocent
owner
defense,
to
notify
the
police.
now,
there
are
steps
short
of
that
that
a
wife
may
very
well
decide
to
take.
