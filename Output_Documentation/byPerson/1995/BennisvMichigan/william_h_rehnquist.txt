we'll

94-8729...
the
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
we'll

94-8729,
tina
bennis
v.
michigan.
mr.
herpel,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we've
held
in
any
number
of
cases
that
there's
not,
that
something
that's
used
in
the
course
of
committing
a
felony
can
be
forfeited.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
herpel,
you
referred
to
your
client
as
an
innocent
owner,
and
how
do
you
define
innocent
owner
for
these
purposes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
and
it
was
a
dissent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--if
not
before,
yes.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
can--
--a
leasing
company
owns
the
vehicles
that
it
leases.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
justice
souter's
point
is
that
the
wife
has
no
control
over
the
use,
either.
she
can't
prevent
her
husband
from
using
it
if
it's
commonly
owned.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
in
goldsmith
we
upheld
the
forfeiture
of
a
conditional
vendor's
interest
in
an
automobile
because
the
buyer
who's
driving
it
around
used
it
for
drugs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
94-8729,
bennis
against
michigan.
petitioner,
tina
bennis
was
a
joint
owner
with
her
husband
john
bennis
of
an
automobile.
detroit
police
arrested
john
bennis
after
observed
him
engaging
in
a
sexual
act
with
a
prostitute
in
the
automobile
which
was
parked
on
the
detroit
city
street.
john
bennis
was
convicted
of
gross
indecency
and
the
state
then
sued
both
john
and
tina
bennis
to
have
the
car
declared
a
public
nuisance
and
forfeited.
tina
bennis
dissented
against
the
forfeiture
of
her
interest
on
the
ground
that
she
did
not
know
that
her
husband
would
use
it
to
violate
michigan’s
indecency
law.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
upheld
the
lower
court's
decision
forfeiting
the
car.
tina
bennis
sought
review
here
claiming
that
michigan’s
forfeiture
scheme
deprived
her
in
the
forfeited
property
without
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
michigan.
a
long
and
unbroken
line
of
our
cases
rejects
the
innocent
owner
defense
and
hold
that
an
owner’s
interest
in
property
may
be
forfeited
by
reason
of
the
use
to
which
the
property
has
put
even
when
the
owner
did
not
know
that
it
was
to
be
put
to
that
use.
these
cases
are
too
firmly
fixed
in
the
country’s
jurisprudence
to
be
overturned
at
this
late
date.
forfeiture
prevents
illegal
uses
of
the
property
and
forfeit
scheme
to
the
extent
to
an
innocent
owner
preclude
the
evasion
by
dispensing
with
the
necessity
of
judicial
inquiries
of
collusion
between
the
wrongdoer
and
the
alleged
innocent
owner.
petitioner
also
raises
a
claim
under
the
takings
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
we
likewise
reject.
the
government
may
not
be
required
to
compensate
an
owner
for
property
which
it
has
already
lawfully
acquired
under
the
exercise
of
governmental
authority
other
than
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
justice
thomas
and
justice
ginsburg
have
filed
separate
concurring
opinions;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissent
in
which
justices
souter
and
breyer
have
joined;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
separate
dissent.
