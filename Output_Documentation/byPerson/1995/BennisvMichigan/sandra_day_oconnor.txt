justice
o'connor
mr.
herpel,
will
you
tell
us
what
the
record
shows
was
the
nature
of
the
ownership
in
the
automobile
in
question?
justice
o'connor
what
kind
of
ownership
under
state
law,
joint
with
right
of
survivorship,
cotenants,
what
was
it?
justice
o'connor
do
we
know?
justice
o'connor
you
can't
tell
us?
justice
o'connor
how
was
the
automobile
titled?
justice
o'connor
in
both
names--
justice
o'connor
--or
one
name?
justice
o'connor
in
michigan
law,
can
one
co-owner
dispose
of
good
title
to
the
automobile?
justice
o'connor
the
entire
automobile.
justice
o'connor
could
one
owner
dispose
of
it?
justice
o'connor
but
you
can't
give
us
any
citations
or
anything
like
that,
or
any
place
in
the
record
where
we
could
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
ownership.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
makes
it
very
difficult,
doesn't
it,
to
decide
this
case
when
we
don't
know
the
nature
of
the
ownership
or
what
rights
a
single
co-owner
would
have.
justice
o'connor
you
can't
give
us
a
case
or
a
statute
or
anything
of
that
sort?
justice
o'connor
and
in
this
case
it's
a
1977
automobile?
justice
o'connor
what
kind
of
automobile?
justice
o'connor
and
so
her
interest
would
be
about
what,
would
you
say?
justice
o'connor
and
how
much
was
paid
for
it?
does
the
record
tell
us
that?
justice
o'connor
so
we're
talking
about
a
claim
of
$300
for
her.
justice
o'connor
and
you
say
that
notion
is
no
longer
valid
at
all?
justice
o'connor
how
is
your
theory
consistent
with
what
this
court
held
in
calero-toledo,
the
leasing
of
a
yacht
and
the
people
who
leased
it
had
marijuana
on
board,
and
the
lessor
didn't
know
that.
in
fact,
it
even
included
provisions
in
the
lease
agreement
that
that
wouldn't
be
done,
and
yet
the
forfeiture
was
upheld.
now,
how
would
your
theory
play
out
there?
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
court
upheld
the
seizure
against
a...
the
forfeiture
against
a
takings
claim
by
the
owner.
justice
o'connor
well,
in
any
event,
under
your
theory
it
would
not
be
possible
to
uphold
a
forfeiture
in
a
calero-toledo
situation.
justice
o'connor
didn't
know--
justice
o'connor
--the
people
leasing
it
were
going
to
have
marijuana
on
board.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
we
look
at
this
as
criminal
liability
here?
is
that
how
we
should
analyze
it?
justice
o'connor
is
it
at
least
possible
that
in
the
context
of
joint
ownership
of
an
automobile
by
a
husband
and
wife,
that
we
should
presume
knowledge
by
each
as
to
the
use
by
the
other--
justice
o'connor
--and
then
put
any
burden
on
the
innocent
spouse
to
prove
otherwise?
justice
o'connor
could
you
address
the
nature
of
the
ownership
of
this
vehicle,
if
you
can
enlighten
us?
justice
o'connor
could
the
creditors
of
one
of
the
spouses
reach
the
entire
vehicle?
justice
o'connor
a
creditor
could
take
the
whole
vehicle.
justice
o'connor
do
you
have
a
citation
for
us
for
that?
justice
o'connor
how
about
a
car
rental...
a
car
rental?
justice
o'connor
the
rental
car,
and--
justice
o'connor
--under
your
theory
the
state
would
take
the
car
if
the
person
renting
the
car
committed
the
unlawful
act
in
the
car.
justice
o'connor
why
not?
justice
o'connor
is
one
co-owner--
--is
it
a
civil
penalty
that's
being
imposed?
justice
o'connor
a
civil
penalty.
justice
o'connor
it's
not
a
public
nuisance
abatement.
justice
o'connor
is
the
car
a
public
nuisance?
justice
o'connor
is
the
car
the
public
nuisance?
justice
o'connor
but
that's
a
very
strange
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
public
nuisance.
normally
you
think
of
it
as
an
ongoing
something
that
constitutes
the
nuisance.
justice
o'connor
to
impose
a
civil
penalty
on
someone,
must
there
be
some
fault
on
the
part
of
the
person
against
whom
the
penalty
is
imposed,
or
can
a
civil
penalty
be
imposed
against
a
totally
innocent
person?
justice
o'connor
but
you
said
it
was.
i'm
just
using
your
words.
justice
o'connor
and
it
is
possible
to
impose
a
civil
penalty
on
someone
without
any
fault
of
the
person--
