justice
ginsburg
does
one
usually
hold
cars
by
tenancy
in
common?
isn't...
but
in
any
event,
he
is
at
least
half-owner,
and
you
can't
impound
half
a
car,
and
you
can't
sell
at
an
auction
half
a
car,
so
in
effect
your
position
seems
to
be
that
she,
because
she
is
half-owner,
can
immunize
him
against
having
his
property
taken,
is
that
essentially
your
position?
justice
ginsburg
well
then,
why
can't...
but
you're
not
saying
it
would
be
enough
to
give
her
whatever
pittance
was
left
from
this
sale
after
administrative
expenses.
justice
ginsburg
is
it
all
right
for
the
state
to
say
this
vehicle
is
a
public
nuisance
because
of
its
use?
justice
ginsburg
but
didn't
it...
suppose
it
had
been
his
car
entirely,
couldn't
they
have...
would
there
have
been
anything
unconstitutional
about
the
forfeiture?
justice
ginsburg
you
answered
the
question.
you
said,
this
vehicle
was
purchased
for
$600,
so
that
the...
what
we're
talking
about,
you
have
conceded
she
doesn't
get
the
car,
the
state
can
take
the
car,
so
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
your
argument
is,
she's
entitled
to
half
of
the
value.
well,
if
she
bought
it...
the
total
price
was
$600,
and
they
had
it
even
for
a
day,
then
the
value
is
less
than
$600,
isn't
it?
justice
ginsburg
so
when
you
said
at
least
$600,
or
at
least
$300,
that
means
you're
assuming
they
made
a
good...
a
very
good
bargain.
justice
ginsburg
why
don't
you
say
joint
tenancy?
why
do
you
pick
the
phrase,
tenancy
in
common?
justice
ginsburg
wasn't
there
a
very
ancient
idea
that
the
thing
was
indeed
the
wrong-doer?
i
think
you
acknowledge
that
in
your
brief.
justice
ginsburg
the
thing
here
is
declared...
the
car
is
declared
a
public
nuisance.
justice
ginsburg
isn't
there...
you
are
saying
the
thing
was
only
security
for
the
claim
because
you
couldn't
get
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
individual,
but
there
was
an
ancient
notion
that
the
thing
itself
is
the
wrongdoer.
as
michigan
calls
it
here
the
thing,
the
car,
is
a
public
nuisance.
justice
ginsburg
how
does
this
relate
to
the
many
cases
where
the
vehicle
that's
carrying
the
contraband
is
taken?
now,
the
federal
government
is
heavily
into
that
business,
too.
does
your
argument
mean
that
every
time
a
car
is
found
loaded
with
drugs
that
if
there
is
a
co-owner,
then
the
co-owner
has
to
be
compensated
for
the
confiscation
of
the
vehicle
that
carries
the
contraband...
boat,
car?
justice
ginsburg
we're
not
dealing
with
this
unusual
michigan
statute
making
cars
public
nuisances.
your
argument
would
cover
the
waterfront
of
all
the
confiscation
of
vehicles
carrying
contraband,
is
that
not
right?
justice
ginsburg
why
was...
why
is
there
a
suggestion
that
a
contrary
result
would
be
reached,
because
earlier
in
that
case,
hadn't
it
been
said
we've
never
found
that
there
was
any
kind
of
fault
requirement,
that
there
was
any
kind
of
innocent
owner,
innocent
objection.
didn't...
wasn't
there
first
that
general
statement?
justice
ginsburg
would
it
satisfy...
would
it
satisfy
your
position
if
the
state
law
were...
when
there's
this
joint
ownership
situation
the
court
is
going
to
make
the
wrong-doing
owner
pay
the
other
one?
it's
not
going
to
come
out
of
the
state's
pocket,
not
out
of
the
people's
pocket,
but
if
she
wants
to
bring
a
claim
against
him,
he's
going
to
have
to
pay.
how
about
that?
that
would
take
care
of
her
need,
compensating
her.
justice
ginsburg
the
state
says,
she
ought
to
be
compensated.
the
car
was
a
nuisance.
he
ought
to
compensate
her.
justice
ginsburg
then
the
wrong-doer--
justice
ginsburg
--the
state
says--
justice
ginsburg
if
it's
a
stolen
vehicle...
suppose
it's
a
stolen
vehicle?
justice
ginsburg
where?
justice
ginsburg
did
the
judge
in
this
case
say
that...
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
the
judge
in
the
court
of
first
instance,
that
he
thought
that
he
had
some
kind
of
equitable
power?
he
said,
well,
there
might
be
situations
bad
enough
that
i
could
do
something,
but
this
one
isn't
so
bad
because
they
have
a
second
car.
that
doesn't
sound
very
criminalist.
justice
ginsburg
the
judge
in
this
case,
didn't
the
judge
say--
justice
ginsburg
--if
things
were
really
terrible,
i
would
make
some
adjustment
here,
but
they're
not
so
terrible
for
tina
bennis
because
they've
got
a
second
car.
justice
ginsburg
so
the
judge
at
least
thought
that
he
had
some
equitable
adjustment
authority,
which
doesn't
seem
to
fit
into
the
criminal
mode.
justice
ginsburg
i
think
i
have...
just
suppose
we
have
a
nuisance
on
land
and
an
absentee
owner
who
doesn't
know
anything
about
it,
and
that
nuisance
has
to
be
abated,
does
the...
under
michigan
law,
does
the
innocent
owner
who
didn't
know
of
the
existence,
and
the
other
one
did,
have
a
right
against
the
co-owner
for
compensation?
justice
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ginsburg
does
the
innocence
of
that
co-owner
stop
the
state
from
abating
the
nuisance?
justice
ginsburg
mr.
seamons,
one
thing
i
don't
understand
is
how
you
put
together
your
test
with
your
end
result,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
in
many,
many,
perhaps
most
marital
situations,
a
person
in
tina
bennis'
situation
could
do
everything
within
her
power
to
do,
but
the
law
gives
the
co-owner
the
right
to
use
the
car
whenever
and
however
he
wants,
so
i
don't
see
how
the
all
reasonable
steps
would
work
out
to
the
disfavor
of
someone
in
tina
bennis'
situation.
justice
ginsburg
she
has
no
power
over
him.
she
could
say
everything
she
wants
and
it's
not
going
to
do
any
good.
justice
ginsburg
how
is
a
tina
bennis
supposed
to
make
sure
that
her
spouse
doesn't
use
a
car
this
way?
