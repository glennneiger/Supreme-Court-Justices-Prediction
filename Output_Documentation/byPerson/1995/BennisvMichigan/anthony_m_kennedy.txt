justice
kennedy
just
before
we
get
too
far
away
from
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
if
the
state
can
forfeit
the
husband's
interest
and
in
your
position
it
has
to
remit
to
the
wife
her
interest...
i
take
it
that's
your
position.
justice
kennedy
does
the
state
have
to
compensate
the
wife
for
the
loss
of
use
of
the
property,
her
portion
of
the
property
while
the
forfeiture
proceedings
are
being
conducted?
justice
kennedy
but
doesn't
that
indicate
the
necessity
of
having
a
forfeiture
provision
such
as
this?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
the
most
efficient
way,
if
the
only
efficient
way
for
the
state
to
enforce
its
laws,
let's
say,
is
to
forfeit
the
offending
vehicle,
then
the
forfeiture
system
is
adequate,
and
all
you're
asking
for
is
that
the
wife's
financial
interest
in
the
automobile
represented
by
her
half
of
the
equity
be
returned
to
her,
is
that
your
position?
justice
kennedy
suppose
that
a
state
had
a
statute
which
said
that
any
registered
owner
of
an
automobile
is
absolutely
liable
for
damages
that
the
automobile
does
in
a
collision,
and
the
husband
gets
in
a
collision,
is
the
wife
subject
to
liability
consistently
with
the
constitution?
justice
kennedy
why
should
this
case
be
different?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
state's
the
one
that
passed
the
statute.
there's
clearly
state
action
in
my
hypothetical.
isn't
the
liability
that
the
wife
is
subject
to
in
my
hypothetical
much
greater,
potentially,
than
the
liability
here?
the
liability
here
is
limited
to
the
amount
of
her
interest
in
the
automobile.
justice
kennedy
we're
asking
about
the
validity
of
the
statute.
there's
no...
don't...
i
wouldn't
be
deterred
by
the
state
action.
you
just
have
to
assume
that
there
is
a
constitutional
defense
against
strict
liability
if
there
is
an
overreaching
on
the
part
of
the
state
by
enacting
the
statute.
you
seem
to
assume
that
the
statute
that
i
gave
you
was
quite
proper,
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
difference
is
between
the
two
cases.
justice
kennedy
ah,
so
it's
punishment.
justice
kennedy
it's
not
being
arrayed
against
the
individual
at
least
in
the
early
forms
of
the
common
law,
it's
being
arrayed
against
the
thing,
the
car.
justice
kennedy
in
the
admiralty
area
as
well
as
in
the
automobile
area?
justice
kennedy
it's
for
highly
regulated
industries,
and
aren't
automobiles
one
of
the
most
highly
regulated
forms
of
instrumentalities
in
our
whole
system?
justice
kennedy
what
about--
--does
it
indicate
that--
--what
about
an
ordinary
creditor?
i
just
have
a
judgment
against
the
husband
for
something
completely
unrelated
to
the
automobile.
can
i
levy
on
the
wife's
interest
in
the
automobile
under
michigan
law?
justice
kennedy
i
think
it
would
be
very
strange
if
you
could
levy
on
the
wife's
interest,
and
i
thought
that
was
the
thrust
of
justice
o'connor's
question.
justice
kennedy
so
control
is
irrelevant
on
your
theory.
justice
kennedy
so
does
your
theory...
if
there's
no
right
to
control
as
an
element
of
your
theory,
is
your
theory
basically
the
kind
of
antique
theory
that
this
is
the
guilty
object?
justice
kennedy
in
this
case,
your
office
has
taken
the
position
we
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
michigan
court--
justice
kennedy
--despite
this
very
troubling
question
about
the
wife's
knowledge
of
her
husband's
activities
and
her
ability
to
do
anything
about
it.
justice
kennedy
so
it's
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
that
wives
should
call
the
police--
--yes.
--when
their
husbands
are
using
prostitutes?
justice
kennedy
don't
let
the
laughter
of
clerks
who
have
never
even
argued
a
case
in
a
municipal
court
deter
you
from
your
answer.
