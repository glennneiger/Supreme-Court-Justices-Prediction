justice
breyer
no.
are
we
supposed
to
assume...
i
wondered
the
same
thing.
i
thought
maybe
we're...
that
we
should
take
an
assumption
that
the
supreme
court
of
michigan...
did
the
supreme
court
make
an
assumption,
namely
the
assumption
that
the
ownership
interest
of
your
client
was
such
that
she
had
an
interest
that
otherwise
couldn't
be
touched,
it
was
her
property,
she
had
an
undivided
interest
or
some
interest
that
was
totally
hers?
justice
breyer
so
what
kind
of
an
assumption
should
we
make?
what
kind
of
assumption
did
they
make?
justice
breyer
so
you're
saying
even
if
she
had,
it
was
just
like
totally
separate
property
under
michigan
law,
she
has
under
michigan
law
something
that's
a
50-percent
separate
interest,
whatever
that
might
mean--
justice
breyer
--well,
i'm
looking
for
the
same
thing.
what
kind
of
assumption
do
we
make?
justice
breyer
like
a
tenancy
in
common.
justice
breyer
there
was
also
a
statement
which
i
had
here
that
they
made
a
point
of
the
fact
that
no
allegation
has
been
made
or
proof
offered
that
the
owner
did
all
that
it
reasonably
could
to
have...
avoid
having
its
property
put
to
an
unlawful
use,
and
then
there
was
a
suggestion
in
dicta
that
had
that
been
done,
that
they
might
have
reached
a
contrary
result.
am
i
reading
it
correctly?
justice
breyer
thank
you.
why
should
a
person
who's
totally
innocent,
who
has
done
whatever
they
could
do
to
stop
the
crime,
who
has
no
knowledge
of
it,
et
cetera,
be
punished
by
having
to
give
up
their
property?
justice
breyer
yes,
i
agree
that
there
are
cases.
that
was
why
i
put
the
question
the
way
i
did.
there
are
pirates,
there
are
smugglers,
there
are
bootleggers,
and
interestingly
enough,
there
are
corporate
shareholders
that
each
of
these
may
be
special
situations.
so
i
know
there
are
cases,
so
that's
why
maybe
the
corporates
are
special,
given
that
they
are
people,
persons,
et
cetera,
but
why...
is
there
any
reason
why
a
person
who
is
totally
innocent
should
be
punished
for
a
criminal
offense
by
having
to
give
up
the
property
that
he
or
she
owns?
justice
breyer
i
know
there
are
those
cases.
the
cases
are
a
question
of...
is
that
the
only
reason,
that
when
there
were
18th
century
pirates,
people
were
really
worried
about
pirates,
for
good
cause,
and
they
had
to
impose
upon
the
owners
of
the
ships
enormous
affirmative
obligations
to
try
to
stop
pirates.
we
don't
have
as
many
pirates
now,
at
least.
[laughter]
so
i
mean,
is
there
any
reason,
other
than
these
historical
facts--
justice
breyer
--which
have
changed
to
a
degree,
or
are
there
some
good
reasons?
justice
breyer
--is
your
position?
justice
breyer
okay.
justice
breyer
is
this...
that's
a
good...
i
mean,
i'm
really
uncertain.
is
this
civil
or
criminal?
i--
justice
breyer
--well,
they
use
the
word
guilty.
the
statute
uses
the
word
guilty.
they
say
if
you
do
this,
if
you
use
a
car
that
you've
leased,
even,
the
car
is
a
nuisance
and
you
are
guilty
of
a
nuisance.
justice
breyer
and
so,
and
this
comes
up
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
how
do
we
answer
this
question?
i
mean,
i
think
it
may
differ
whether
it's
a
criminal
punishment
or
whether
it's
a
civil...
but
they...
it's
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
if
the...
would
the
person
who
ran
such
a
car
have
a
criminal
record--
justice
breyer
--who
was
guilty
of
a
nuisance?
justice
breyer
and
the
reason
again...
i
don't
want
to
come...
look,
i
got
a
little
distracted,
because
what's
going
on
is
that
whatever
you
call
it,
the
person
is
giving
up
a
lot
of
property
who's
totally
innocent,
and
the
reason
they're
giving
it
up
is
because
it
was
an
instrumentality
of
a
crime,
right?
i
mean,
that's
basically
the
reason.
justice
breyer
and
they
are.
yes,
all
right.
justice
breyer
it
was...
they're
giving
it
up
because
a
person
used
it
to
commit
what
was
a
crime
under
this
statute,
as
i
read
it.
is
there
some...
what's
the
reason
why
the
innocent
person
is
required
to
give
up
the
property?
what
policy
does
it
serve?
what
purpose
does
it
serve?
what's
the
theory
of
why
you
are
requiring
them
to
give
up
this
piece
of
property
that
is
theirs
when
they
themselves
are
innocent
and
have
done
everything
possible
to
prevent
its
use
as
an
instrumentality?
justice
breyer
i
know
that,
but
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
the...
i'm
trying
to
get
my
own
thinking
straight
on
other
cases
as
well
as
this
one
that
relate--
