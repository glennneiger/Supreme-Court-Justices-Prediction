justice
scalia
if
she
should
have
known
at
that
time
that
he
was
a
scoundrel,
that
would
suffice?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
specifically
the
impending
illegal
use.
it
can't
be
enough
that
this
not
a
really
reliable
person
that
i
wouldn't
trust
the
car
with,
lord
knows
what
he'll
do
with
it?
justice
scalia
wow.
justice
scalia
easy
come,
easy
go
is
your
answer
to
that
one,
i
think,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
it
could
hold
it
until
the
claim
was
satisfied,
couldn't
it,
and
then
redeliver
the
ship
to
the
person
who...
right?
justice
scalia
but
it
didn't
do
that.
you
couldn't
redeem
the
ship.
it
seized
the
ship.
it
was
gone.
justice
scalia
the
deodand.
justice
scalia
it
used
to
be
due
process
but
is
no
longer,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
does
your--
--that
would
be
a
good
argument
in
every
case
except
one
involving
a
car.
don't
you
have
the
same
problem
with
a
car?
justice
scalia
well,
let's
assume
you
have
a
negligent
owner
who
negligently
entrusted
it,
as
you're
willing
to
acknowledge
would
render
him
properly
punishable,
why
can't
the
state
say,
i'm
not
going
to
go
running
down
where
the
owner
is,
i'm
going
to
grab
the
car.
he
can
come
back
and
make
his
argument
that
he
wasn't
negligent,
but
meanwhile,
you
know,
i
think
he's
negligent.
i'm
taking
his
car.
justice
scalia
it's
just
like
a
ship.
justice
scalia
this
could
have
been
an
out-of-state
car,
and
why
should
michigan
have
to
go
running
to
some
other...
so
we're
just
going
to
say,
if
there's
a
crime
committed
in
a
car,
we
think
cars
are
like
ships
in
that
regard.
we're
just
going
to
grab
the
car.
we'll
sort
it
all
out
later.
justice
scalia
well,
do
you--
--does
it
follow
from
your
argument
that
there
cannot
be
any
criminal
punishment
without
at
least
negligence?
you
could
have
no...
it's
absolute
liability,
absolute
criminal
liability--
justice
scalia
--saying,
if
your
corporation
does
such
a
thing,
you
will
be
fined
so
much
money,
period,
up
to
you
to
make
sure
it
doesn't,
we
don't
care
how
careful
you've
been,
absolute
liability.
is...
doesn't
that
follow
from
your
argument?
justice
scalia
what's
the
difference
whether
it's
a
forfeiture
or
a
fine?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
essence
of
your
argument
is,
you
shouldn't
punish
somebody
who
hasn't
been...
who
hasn't
been
blameworthy.
if
you
cannot
punish
them
by
a
forfeiture,
why
can
you
punish
them
by
a
fine?
justice
scalia
that
doesn't
make
any
sense,
mr.
roberts.
has
your
state
supreme
court
held
that,
that
hertz
is
off
the
hook?
justice
scalia
they
have?
justice
scalia
you
would
say
there's
a
distinction
between
her
as
a
100-percent
owner
and
hertz
as
a
100-percent
owner.
justice
scalia
could
you
give
us
the
citation
of
the
hertz
case
later?
i
mean,
just
submit
it
to
the
court.
i'd
like
to
know
what
that
is.
justice
scalia
well,
i--
--oh,
prosecutorial
discretion.
oh.
--if
i
understand
it,
even
in
this
case
the
court
said
that
this
car,
if
the
same
act
had
been
performed
in
some
other
section
where
it
was
not
a
common
problem,
it
would
not
have
been
a
nuisance.
justice
scalia
it
isn't
just
that
the
performance
of
some
unlawful
act
renders
a
thing
a
nuisance.
justice
scalia
they
really
do
mean
a
nuisance,
don't
they?
but
isn't
the
constitutional
issue
the
same?
couldn't
they
do
it
just
on
one
case
at
a
time?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
have
to
agree
with
that
to
agree
with
the
rest
of
your
position,
i
hope,
because
i...
you
know,
there
was
a
whole...
in
the
old
law
of
deodands
there
was
a
whole
intricate
theory
of
when,
indeed,
the
instrumentality
was
being
used
to
commit
the
crime
or
not,
and
i
don't
have
to
think
that
the
whole
house
is
being
used
to
commit
the
crime
of
one
puff
of
a
marijuana
cigarette--
justice
scalia
--do
i?
justice
scalia
--it
causes
these
people
to
be
very
careful
whom
they
give
their
car
to,
or
loan
their
car
to,
or
whom
they
go
into
co-ownership
with,
i
assume.
doesn't
it
have
that
functional
purpose?
justice
scalia
mr.
seamon,
where...
i
mean,
as
an
original
matter,
if
i
were
writing
a
statute
i
might
well
buy
your,
you
know,
all
reasonable
steps
standard.
it
seems
like
a
good
idea.
but
we're
not
writing
a
statute.
where
do
you
get
it
from?
i
mean,
where
do
you
find
it
in
our
historical
tradition,
or
is
it
just
that,
you
know,
we
should
say,
well,
it
seems
like
a
good
idea,
it
must
be
constitutional
law.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
do
you
find
it
somewhere
in
our
cases?
justice
scalia
from
a
dictum
in...
and
that
is
enough
to
adopt
it?
justice
scalia
what
history
does
that,
when
we've
certainly
done
it
with
respect
to
vessels.
justice
scalia
was
he
speaking
of
constitutional
law--
justice
scalia
--or
of
equitable
power
to
declare
the
forfeiture?
justice
scalia
they
do
that
in
dictum,
whereas
the
other
cases
do
it
in
holding,
don't
they?
justice
scalia
it
seems
a
rather
significant
distinction.
