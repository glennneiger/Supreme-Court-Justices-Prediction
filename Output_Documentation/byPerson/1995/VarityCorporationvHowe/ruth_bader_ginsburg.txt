did
those
go
to
the
group
to
whom
no
misrepresentations
were
made
but
who
were
under
a
plan...
unknown
to
them,
they
are
placed
under
some
other
plan
in
another
entity
that
proves
insolvent?
mr.
abrams,
there
was
one
footnote
in
your
reply
brief
that
i
must
say
took
me
aback,
and
that
was
the
one
that
said
that,
surely
these
people
who
were
transferred
from
one
entity
to
another
without
a
word
of
notice,
surely
they
have
no
complaint
because
no
misrepresentation
was
made
to
them.
it
was
just
done
without
even
giving
them
any
notice,
any
opportunity
to
say
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
wasn't
a
terminate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
ask
you
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
we
can
be
very
clear
that
we're
talking
about
the
same,
not
entirely
hypothetical
case.
employees
work
for
a
company
under
a
plan,
and
they
retire,
and
while
they
are
in
retirement,
the
trustee...
we're
dealing
with
a
single
employer
plan...
takes
that
plan,
duplicates
it,
identical
plan,
puts
it
in
another
entity,
which
is
tottering
on
the
brink
of
bankruptcy,
and
then
when
these
people
claim
their
benefits
tells
them,
oh,
sorry,
you're
no
longer
under
the
entity
that
was
able
to
pay
for
your
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
you
terminate,
don't
you
have
to
give
people
notice
so
that
they
can
find
other
insurance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
asking
you
about
disclosure.
i'm
asking
if--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we're
in
the
termination
mode,
if
you
terminate
a
plan,
don't
you
have
to
give
the
beneficiaries
notice
that
they're
being
terminated
so
that
they
can
get
alternate
protection
for
themselves?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you...
i
just...
if
you
tell
me
that
that's
what
your
position
is
and
that's
what
the
law
is,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
whole
of
erisa
that
stops
an
employer
from
putting
people
under
an
umbrella
that
is
going
to
be
swiftly
bankrupt
without
telling
them,
that
there's
nothing
in
erisa
that
stops
that,
and
moreover,
because
erisa
is
preemptive,
these
people
have
nothing
to
complain
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
nothing
in
erisa...
what
happened
here
with
respect
to
the
ones--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--who
were
already
retired,
where
they
got
no
notice
of
this
transfer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you're
saying
that
the
employees
security...
income
security
act
allows
an
employer
to
do
this.
the
misrepresentations,
then,
are
beside
the
point.
they
don't
have
to
say
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
congress,
when
it
set
up
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act,
gave
employees
no
security
against
what
happened
here,
against
waking
up
one
morning
and
find
that
they
have
no
coverage
because
they
are
now
under
some
umbrella
that
they
never
heard
of.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right,
i
think
i
have
your
answer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
don't
have
to
get
any
notice
so
that
they
can
get...
that
erisa
simply
allows
this
to
happen,
and
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
abrams,
in
that
respect,
a
plan
is
only
helped
by
having
a
lot
of
people
drop
out
of
it
so
the
plan
has
assets,
so
there's
a
dysjunction
there.
the
people
who
have
brought
this
action
are
the
people
who
were
injured.
the
plan
isn't
injured
by
having
fewer
people
to
cover.
so
these
people
are
claiming
that
we
have
an
injury
because
of
what
this
trustee
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
are
you
saying,
again,
that
erisa
does
not
protect
these
employees,
it
only
protects
plans?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
could
see--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
plan
is
a
stand-in
for
the
individual...
in
many
situations,
it
is.
if
the
plan
gets
the
relief,
then
the
beneficiary
will
get
the
relief.
but
here,
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
it's...
the
plan
hasn't
been
deprived
of
any
assets.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
can
understand
that
very
well
with
respect
to
plans.
assets
have
been
managed,
assets
have
dwindled,
and
so
we
build
up
the
plan.
i
don't
understand
that...
it's
certainly
no
remedy
for
people
who
have
the
complaint
that
these
people
have.
you
said
that
they
could
sue
for
benefits
wrongfully
withheld,
but
there
are
no
benefits
wrongfully
withheld
on
your
theory
that
they're
under
this
new
umbrella,
and
it's
too
bad
the
umbrella,
that
company's
gone
bankrupt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
had
an
entitlement
to
notice
of
termination
if
that's
what
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
weren't
told.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
abrams,
if
both
readings,
yours
and
the
one
that's
being
put
forward
by
the
other
side,
if
both
are
plausible,
do
we
take
into
account
at
all
what
was
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
entire
erisa
that's
expressed
in
its
very
title...
employee
security?
if
we're
in
equipoise
between
your
interpretation
and
the
other
side's,
shouldn't
we
look
at
the
underlying
purpose
of
this
whole
scheme,?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
certainly
not,
but
the
overarching
purpose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
for
the
purpose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
providing
employees
with
security.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
didn't
ask
if
every
call
in
the
statute
is
in
favor
of
the
employees.
i
asked
you
if
we
are
in
the
situation
of
saying,
we
read
your
brief
and
your
interpretation
of
these
provisions,
and
we
read
the
other
side,
could
we
use--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that
goes
also
for
the
group
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument
that
as
to
the
10
plaintiffs
who
never
worked
for
mcc,
that
no
misrepresentations
were
made
to
those
individuals
in
connection
with
the
transfer
of
their
coverage
to
mcc,
so
there's
no
basis
for
affirming
the
decision
below,
your
opponent
argues,
with
respect
to
that
belief,
because
they
weren't
told
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
misrepresentations
were
made
to
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
we
do
have
a
footnote
5--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
says
that
exclusively
that
we're
not
passing
on
that
question.
