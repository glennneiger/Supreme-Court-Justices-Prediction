justice
antonin

i
think
his
point
was
simply
when
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
permits
termination,
it's
very
hard
to
think
that
somehow
employees
have
been
deprived
of
statutorily
required
security
by
not
being
given
notice
of
the
transfer
to
a
new
company.
under
the
statute
they
could
have
been
terminated.
they...
you
know,
it's
sort
of
hard
to
talk
about
their
deprivation
of
some
security
that
the
statute
assured
to
them.
the
statute
allowed
them
to
be
terminated
completely.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
justification
for
saying
that
you
cannot
reasonably
argue
that
they
have
been
deprived
of
some
security
interest
which
the
statute
guarantees
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
mean,
indeed,
except,
of
course,
any
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
that
result
in
loss
of
benefits
to
the
individual,
which
he
can
recover
for
under
(a),
(a)(1)(b).
certainly
that
covers
a
large
number
of
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
abrams'
argument
is
not
to
deny
that
there
are
not
individual
rights
that
one
would
ordinarily
have
against
a
trustee,
which
are
eliminated
here,
but
rather
to
say
their
elimination
is
part
of
the
scheme
of
the
statute,
just
as
the
ability
of
the
employer
to
simply
terminate
unilaterally,
which
is
extraordinary,
is
part
of
the
statute.
it
was
cost-benefit
analysis.
we
want
to
make
these
schemes
easy
and
cheap
for
the
employer
to
manage
so
that
more
employers
will
establish
them.
why
isn't
that
a
plausible
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that
run
directly
to
beneficiaries?
i
mean,
the
argument
mr.
abrams
makes
is
that
404
just
establishes
the
standard
of
care,
but
that
it's
409
which
says
to
whom
you
are
liable
for
breach
of
your
fiduciary
duty--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
that's
the
title
of
409.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see...
i
mean,
what
they're
contesting
is
whether
it
is
part
of
the
administration
of
the
plan.
i
don't
see
how
it
becomes
more
administration
if
you
lie
and
less
administration
if
you
tell
the
truth,
or
less
administration
if
you
just
remain
silent.
i
mean,
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
point
is,
was
this
part
of
the
administering
of
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
you've
just
undone
what
you
just
conceded.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
the
fact
that
you're
lying
cause
it
to
be
administration
when
if
you
were
telling
the
truth
it
wouldn't
be
administration?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
worry
that
it's
your
case.
i
mean,
this
is
an
enormously
important
issue.
every
employer
who
runs
a
single
employer
plan
is
going
to
be
at
risk
with
respect
to
everything
he
says
in
the
operation
of
his
business,
because
he
is
a
trustee
at
all
times,
and
he
is
subject
to
lawsuits
by
people
saying,
well,
when
you
made
this
representation
you
had
a
trustee's
obligation.
i
think
we
need
an
absolutely
clear
line,
and
if
the
line
is
going
to
be
something
like,
well,
if
you're
lying
it
somehow
moves
closer
to
administration,
i
don't
know
how
an
employer
would
know
how
to
behave.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
were
those
findings
based
on?
i
mean,
i
thought
we
had
the
words
that
they
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
were
those
words--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you're
relying
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true.
that's
not
what
you're
suing
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
plan
benefits
were
changed?
the
plan
benefits
were--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
is
whether
it
is
not
undertaken,
whether
it
is
of
interest
to
people
who
were
in
the
plan,
whether
it
would
affect
their
actions
in
the
plan,
the
issue
is
whether
it...
the
representation
is
made
in
the
administration
of
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
certainly
not
his
duty
to
disclose
the
financial
health
of
the
company,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
anticipated
future
prospects
for
the
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
--wait,
i
don't
understand
that.
why
not?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
suit
would
lie.
i
mean,
if
you're
saying
that
they
might
lose
because
you'd
have
to
give
deference
to
the
trustee's
interpretation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
sure,
but
i
think
what
justice
breyer
is
concerned
about,
as
i
am,
is
simply
the
volume
of
litigation
that
is
going
to
arise--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
you
allow
individual
suits.
