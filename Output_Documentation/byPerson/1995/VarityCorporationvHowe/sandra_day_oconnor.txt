--does
it
require,
however,
that
the
health
plan
be
terminated
or
amended
as
opposed
to
simply
moving
people
around
to
another
company?
does
it
require
some
action
by
the
plan
manager?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
this
looks
like
is
that
what
happened
was
something
that
had
the
result
of
causing
the
plan
not
to
be
funded,
but
it
was
not
technically
an
amendment
or
a
termination
of
the
health
plan,
am
i
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
a
termination
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--there
was
no
action
taken
by
verity
saying,
as
of
date
x,
we
terminate
this
plan.
it
was
done
very
indirectly,
in
a
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
abrams,
under
subpart
(3),
it
must
mean
something.
it
does
say
that
a
participant
or
a
beneficiary
can
bring
a
civil
suit
to
enjoin
an
act
or
practice
violating
the
law
or
the
terms
of
the
plan,
or
to
obtain
other
appropriate
equitable
relief,
whatever
that
is.
does
that
mean,
for
instance,
that
the
people
who
were
transferred
without
their
knowledge
from
the
original
plan
to
the
new
corporation
could,
perhaps,
at
least
bring
a
suit
to
enjoin
that
action
and
require
that
they
be
returned
to
the
original
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
perhaps
not
to
seek
damages,
certainly.
that
seems
to
be
limited,
as
the
court
has
described
in
russell,
but
is
there
anything
left
under
(3)
by
way
of
a
right
to
get
an
injunction,
or
some
kind
of
equitable
order?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
have
no
issue
before
us
here
as
the
case
comes
to
us
about
whether
what
you
did
recover
fits
that
description.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
looks
a
lot
like
damages.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
do
you
interpret
what
is
it,
501(a)(3)?
do
you
think
that
the
russell
case
somehow
pointed
the
way
to
a
more
limited
meaning?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
they
had,
could
they
have
recovered?
