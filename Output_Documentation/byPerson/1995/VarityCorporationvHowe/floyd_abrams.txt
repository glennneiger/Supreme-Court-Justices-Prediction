mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
erisa
case,
and
i
think
it's
useful
at
the
outset
to
make
clear
what
the
case
is
not
about.
this
case
does
not
involve
any
breach
by
varity
of
any
promise
it
made
in
any
of
its
erisa
documents,
or
with
respect
to
the
nature
and
scope
of
any
erisa
plan.
there
was
no
dispute
in
any
of
the
judicial
opinions
below
about
the
proposition
that
the
official
erisa
plan
documents
did
not
provide
for
vested
or
lifetime
welfare
benefits,
and
there
was
a
ruling,
from
which
certiorari
has
not
been
sought
from
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
that
there
was
no
entitlement
to
benefits
in
this
case
under
section
502(a)(1)(b),
the
benefits
section
of
erisa.
the
questions
before
this
court,
then,
are
not
whether
benefits
were
due,
or
whether
erisa
was
violated
because
in
some
way
there
were
improper
misrepresentations
made
about
plan
documents.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
we
were
to
prevail
in
this
court,
respondents
would
have
the
following
potential
remedies.
they
have
a
case
pending
in
the
federal
court
in
iowa
in
which
they
purport
to
assert,
and
we
will
oppose
it,
of
course,
certain
common
law
claims
which
they
maintain
are
not
preempted
under
erisa,
claims
of
nonfair
dealing,
claims
of
constructive
dismissal.
mr.
floyd
abrams
actually,
we
have
not
argued
that
those
claims
are
preempted.
it
is
not
our
position
that
those
claims
are
preempted.
they
also
have
a
claim
for
fraud,
and
fraudulent
misrepresentation
and
the
like.
we
believe
those
claims
are
preempted,
but...
so
they
have
those
potential
claims.
there
are
two
claims
as
to
which
the
district
court
ruled
against
us
on,
as
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach,
and
which
are
not
before
this
court
because
they
weren't
reached,
a
section
510
claim
under
erisa,
and
an
estoppel
claim
under
erisa.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there's
no
provision
in
erisa,
and
there
is
no
provision
in
any
contract
in
this
case,
providing
for
notice.
we
had
an
absolute
right
to
terminate
these
individuals.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
was...
what
happened
here
in
fact
was
a
termination
and--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
absolutely
what
you
cannot
do
under
a
pension
plan.
with
respect
to
health
benefits,
since
you
have
an
absolute
right
to
terminate,
a
right
which
was
reserved
explicitly
here
and
which
the
law
assumes
any--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--this
is
not
a
case
involving
an
alleged
failure
of
disclosure.
this
is
not
a
disclosure
claim
by
them.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
they're--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--if
they're
entitled
to
benefits,
it
is
our
position
the
place
to
go
is
the
benefits
section
of
erisa.
that
is
what
it
is
there
for.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
what
i'm--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
retirement,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
a
vesting
point
under
erisa.
retirement
has
no
more
clarity
for
erisa
purposes
than
any
time
when
they
were
employed,
or
after
they
ceased
to
be
employed.
if
it
is
true
that
my
client
had
an
absolute
right
to
cancel
these
people,
to
terminate
these
people,
to
alter
the
plan
of
these
people
without
telling
them,
without
their
consent,
and
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
erisa
law--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--the
misrepresentations,
indeed,
are
beside
the
point
with
respect
to
these
people.
the
misrepresentations
are
entirely
irrelevant
with
respect
to
these
people.
there
people
had
no--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no
more
protection
than
waking
up
some
morning
and
finding
they
have
no
coverage
at
all.
these
employees
were
paid
for
22
months.
suppose...
because
the
new
company
paid
them.
suppose
they'd
not
been.
suppose
what
had
happened
here--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--sorry.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
my
position,
and
that
erisa--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
does
require
some...
something
has
to
happen,
justice
o'connor.
i
mean,
a
real
act.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
was
not
technically
an
amendment
to
the
health
plan
itself.
what
it
was--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--what
it
was...
i
believe
it
was
a
term--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--sorry.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
was
done
in
a
purchase
agreement
as
between
verity
and
mcc,
which
explicitly
provided
for
the
termination
by
verity,
then
massey-ferguson,
if
its
obligations,
and
the
taking
over
of
those
obligations
by
the
new
company.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
sorry.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
second
issue
in
this
case
is
just
what
you've
described.
is
what
you've
described
a
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation,
or
is
it,
because
it
is
not
a
part
of
plan
administration--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
would
reverse
the
questions,
but
those
are
indeed
the
questions,
and
the
first
of
them,
as
we
see
it,
is,
is
there
a
cause
of
action
here
at
all?
is
there
an
individual
cause
of
action
which
can
be
brought
by
somebody,
or
his
or
her
or
a
group's
own
relief,
as
opposed
to
a
plan's
relief.
now,
this
court
has
not
addressed
that
question
directly.
it
has
addressed
the
section
of
erisa
which
is
next
to
(a)(3).
it's
addressed
(a)(2).
mr.
floyd
abrams
right.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
am
saying
that
erisa
does
not
provide
a
private
cause
of
action
for
an
individual
on
his
own
behalf
to
assert--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
will
always
be
the
case.
that
will
always
be
the
case
when
an--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--well,
what
the
individuals
can
sue
for--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--subject
only,
justice
souter,
to
the
proposition
that
an
individual
can
sue
for
loss
of
benefits.
that
is
precisely...
i
mean,
the
whole
structure
of
erisa
is
arranged
so
that
the
first
provision
of
civil
remedies--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--if
he's--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
he
has
improperly
been
deprived
of
benefits,
the
claim
he
should
make,
the
claim
erisa
sends
him
to,
is
a
claim
for
lost
benefits,
and
if
he
is
not
entitled
to
lost
benefits
under
erisa,
you've
already
held
in
russell
that
he
cannot
claim
under
subpart
(2),
which
is
a
plan-oriented
claim,
so
this
court
has
found,
with
respect
to
fiduciary
obligations.
the
question
here,
then,
is
can
the
individual
sue
under
subpart
(3)
for
the
same
thing
he
cannot
sue
for
under
subpart
(2),
breach
of
fiduciary
obligations.
mr.
floyd
abrams
not,
we
think,
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
they
can
bring
the
action,
and
we
have
not
argued
to
the
contrary,
under
section
510.
section
510
of
erisa
does
allow
an
employee
who
is
wrongly
discharged
to
seek
back
pay,
reinstatement,
and
the
like.
that
action
can
be
brought
through
(a)(3),
but
the
reason,
as
we
see
it,
that
the
(a)(3)
cannot
be
used
to
seek
fiduciary
responsibility
is
all
the
potential
for
duplication
overlap
and
inconsistency--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--we
read
section
409
to
be
the
exclusive
place
to
get
an
injunction.
of
course
you
can
get
an
injunction
under
409,
but
it's
a
plan
that
can
get
an
injunction
under
409.
as
we
understand
409,
it
is
the
remedy
congress
chose
to
deal
with
breaches
of
fiduciary
obligation,
and
all
breaches.
mr.
floyd
abrams
my
theory
is
not
just
that
they
had
a
new
umbrella,
but
that
they
never
had
entitlement
to
benefits,
never
for
a
moment
had
entitlement
to
benefits.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
they
had
an
entitlement
to
notice
of
termination,
they
certainly
received
that
when
they
were
told
that
they
were
part
of
a
new
company.
if
the
problem
here--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--they
were
told--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--when
they
were
told
they
weren't
getting
any
more
benefits.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
saying,
they
received
benefits
for
the
entire
period.
there
was
no
hiatus
here.
there
was
no
period
when
massey-ferguson
plan
was
going
on
and
the
new
company
was
out
there
and
they
didn't
get
benefits.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
it
is
my
position--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--what
i'm--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
they
did
sue
for
benefits.
they
lost.
they
should
have
lost.
there's
no
petition
for
certiorari
pending--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that
certainly
is
our
position,
justice
souter.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's...
that's
the
position
that
we
took
below
and
now.
now--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that
is
our--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--we
believe--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
now,
404,
of
course--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--which
they're
relying
on
either
leads
into
409
or
should
be
viewed,
they
maintain,
separately.
it's
our
view
that
404
is
a
part
of
a
scheme.
404
imposes,
sets
forth
the
prudent...
"the
prudent
man
standard
of
care.
"
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
there
were
false
information
given
of
that
sort,
then
if
we
were
to
lose
on
point
1...
that
is
to
say,
if
there
is
a...
an
individualized
cause
of
action
here,
we
agree
we
should
lose
on
point
2
on
that.
i
mean,
one
still
has
to
address
the
first
question
of
whether
they
have
a
claim
at
all
for
individualized
relief,
but
if
they
do,
then
i
agree
that
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
that
would,
indeed,
constitute
a
brief
of
fiduciary
obligation.
now--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
correct.
that's
not
something
that
we've
raised.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
do
not
argue
that.
now,
the
first
question,
then,
is,
is
there
a
cause
of
action?
does
409
mean
what
we
think
it
means?
are
we
correct
in
our
overview
that
409
should
be
read
as
the
culmination
of
these
various
sections
of
erisa,
including
section
404,
and
if
that
is
correct,
as
we
maintain
it
is,
if
that's
correct,
then
we
think
that
there
should
be
a
ruling
of
this
court
that
there's
no
individualized
cause
of
action.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
it's
entirely
appropriate
to
look
at
the
underlying
purpose,
but
i
would
disagree
that
that
is
the
only
underlying
purpose.
erisa,
as
this
court
has
indicated,
was
the
result
of
a
bundle
of
compromises,
and
not
all
the
compromises
were
made
in
favor
of
the
members
of
the
participants
in
erisa
plans.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
overarching
purpose
of
welfare
benefits,
as
opposed
to
pension
benefits,
was
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
encourage
employers
to
offer
and
to
perpetuate
what
they
need
not
offer
and
need
not
perpetuate--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--which
is
welfare
plans.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
with
the
view
that
if
you
allow
employers
to
cut
off
plans,
if
you
allow
employers
to
do
all
sorts
of
things
impossible
and
illegal
with
respect
to
pensions,
that
you'll
wind
up
with
more
plans
and
more
benefits,
but
i
do
not
agree
that
erisa
in
this
area,
in
the
welfare
area,
can
properly
be
read
as
simply
designed
to
assure
more
security
for
individuals,
except
in
the
sense
that
i've
said
it.
it
was
to
do
it--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--you
certainly
can
use
the
purpose
of
erisa,
and
i
would
add
to
that,
the
structure
of
erisa.
you
really
have
to
look,
in
our
view,
at
how
erisa
was
crafted,
what
this
court
said
was
the
carefully
crafted
nature
of
erisa,
and
the
interrelationship
of
the
sections.
does
it
make
sense
to
say
that
what
congress
intended,
in
what
the
court
has
said
was
a
very
thoughtful
and
careful
creation
of
this,
that
what
congress
meant
to
do
is
to
have
two
lines,
sometimes
quite
inconsistent,
with
respect
to
the
breach
of
fiduciary
duties,
have
only
one
section
of
law
which
defines
when
you
commit
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
when
you
do
not
commit
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
what
is
it
that
you're
supposed
to
do
about
fiduciary
duty,
which
applies
only
to
plans,
for
congress
not
to
have
adopted
any
other
section
for
individuals.
well,
we
think
that
the
way
to
make
sense
of
erisa
if
you're
in
equipoise,
or
even
if
you're
not,
the
way
to
make
sense
of
it
is
to
read
it
all,
and
that
we
think
when
you
read
it
all
that
that's
the
way
that
you
should
read
it.
now,
if
we're
wrong
on
that,
then
you
reach
the
second
issue,
and
then
you
reach
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
a
matter
of
plan
administration.
it's
not
an
open
question
that
employers
that
are
on
erisa
plans
are
permitted
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
think
of
their
own
benefits,
their
own
interests,
and
the
interests
of
those
who
are
in
erisa
plans.
that's
a
proposition
of
longstanding.
the
question
here,
the
narrow,
legal
question
is,
when
my
client
made
various
statements
designed
to
persuade
people
to
join
mcc,
the
new
corporation,
was
that...
is
that
fairly
reasonably
described
as
a
part
of
plan
administration.
we
don't
think
it
is,
and--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
basically
it's
the
same...
you
have
to
address
the
same
question,
is
it
plan
administration
for
everyone,
because
if
it's
not
plan
administration,
you're
not
acting
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
you
are
acting...
that
things
which
would
be
unthinkable
for
a
trustee
of
a
will,
say,
who
is
supposed
to
be
thinking
only
of
the
interests
that
the
trustee
is
serving,
are
entirely
appropriate
with
respect
to
erisa.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
agree
with
that,
justice
kennedy,
and
they
did.
there
is
no
claim
here
that
they
received
inaccurate
information
about
the
plan.
the
brief
amicus
curiae
of
the
united
states,
for
example,
makes
very
clear,
and
very
honorably,
although
we
disagree
wich
them,
that
the
one
statement
made
to
the
individuals
about
the
plan
was
true,
that
the
plan
would
be
the
same
after,
as
it
was
before,
that
there
would
be
no
changes
in
the
plan
terms
after
as
before.
all
the
allegations
of
falseness
and
of
false
statements,
every
single
one
of
them,
relates
not
to
statements
about
the
plan,
but
as
to
why
you
should
join
the
new
company,
and
the
good
qualities
of
the
new
company,
and
looking
forward
to
a
bright
future,
et
cetera,
and
that
is
indeed
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
maintain
that
this
is
not
plan
administration,
whatever
plan
administration
is.
mr.
floyd
abrams
at
some
level
of
abstraction
everything,
or
almost
everything,
can
relate
to
the
plan
that
relates
to
the
company.
a
healthier
company
has
a
healthier
plan.
a
plan
with
fewer
people
in
it
has
more
money
to
spend,
and
the
like.
we
think
that
when
the
representations
that
are
involved
are,
we
think
you
should
go
to
the
new
company
because
it
has
a
bright
future,
we
think
that
you
ought
to
go
to
the
new
company
because
it
will
be
a
good
company,
that
that...
it
tortures
the
language,
with
all
respect,
of
plan
administration
to
say
that
that
is
plan
administration.
i
mean,
we--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
my
answer,
and
i
would
give
the
rest
of
my
answer
as
well
about
the
nature
of
erisa
as
a
whole,
the
nature
of
welfare
benefits,
the
schema
about
welfare
as
opposed
to
pension
benefits
and
the
like.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'd
like
to
return
to
justice
o'connor's
observation
earlier,
when
you
said
that
it
looked
a
lot
like
damages.
it's
perfectly
true
that
we
have
not
put
at
issue
here,
and
it's
not
before
the
court
whether
this
is
equitable
relief
or
not.
the
district
court
basically
gave
the
class
a
choice
of
either
taking
a
lump
sum
in
damages
for
everything,
or
reinstatement
and
the
like.
it
looks
a
lot
to
us...
and
both
of
them
look
a
lot
to
us
like
benefits.
it
is
the
award
of
benefits,
and
that...
and
it
is
instinct
in
that
award
of
benefits.
that's
what
they'll
be
getting
if
we
lose
this
case,
is
that
there's
at
least
a
potential
conflict
with
subpart
(1),
or
at
least
an
overlap
with
subpart
(1).
we
think
subpart
(1)
is
supposed
to
deal
with
benefits.
we
think
that
there
is
a
clarity
to
the
statute.
sure,
there's
some
overlap,
but
this
court
has
praised
congress
occasionally
for
crafting
this
with
special
care
and
the
like.
subpart
(1)
is
the
benefit
section,
and
it
is
the
case
that
if
we
lose
here
that,
in
the
ordinary
course,
any
well-advised
plaintiff
will
sue
under
subpart
(1)
and
(3),
under
(1)
for
saying,
i
didn't
get
benefits,
under
(3)
for
saying,
you
breached
your
fiduciary
obligations
in
not
awarding
me
benefits,
and
we
think
that's
not
an
appropriate
way
to
interpret
what
congress
meant,
nor
do
we
think
it's
appropriate
to
interpret
the
breadth
of
section
409
in
such
a
narrow
way
as
has
been
suggested
today.
i
read,
in
conclusion,
the
first
line
of
section
409(a),
any
person
who
is
a
fiduciary
with
respect
to
a
plan
who
breaches
any
of
the
responsibilities
obligations,
or
duties,
et
cetera,
as
the
start
of
it.
we
think
that
section
409
was
congress'
effort
to
deal
with
"liability
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
"
and
unless
this
court
is
to
revisit
russell...
and
we
understand
full
well
russell
doesn't
govern
here.
you
said
it
didn't
govern.
but
unless
you
are
to
revisit
russell,
it
is
the
logic,
it
is
the
sense
of
russell,
and
of
409,
and
of
the
statute
as
comprehensively
viewed,
that
there
cannot
be
recovery
here.
mr.
floyd
abrams
thank
you,
your
honor.
