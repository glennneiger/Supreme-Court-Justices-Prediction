justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
don't...
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
necessarily
have
a
right
in
the
questionnaire,
when
they
say,
what
happens
to
my
benefits
and
pensions,
to
say,
they'll
stay
the
same,
the
company
has
a
bright
future,
and
your
benefits
are
quite
secure.
i
mean,
that
might
be
to
mislead
them,
i
take
it,
in
respect
to
their
decision
about
whether
to
stay
with
the
company
and
have
a
plan,
or
go
to
a
new
one,
and
i
thought
this
case
is
about
whether
those
statements
are
fraudulent
in...
where
you
didn't
think
they
were
true,
in
respect
to
a
pension
plan
information,
and
that
is
a
cause
of
action
there.
in
fact,
it's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation,
arguably,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
is
a
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation,
then
why
can't
the
person
whose
duty
was
breached
bring
an
action,
because
isn't
there
an
obligation
that
a
fiduciary
under
erisa
has
the
same
obligations
as
a
fiduciary
at
common
law,
and
those
obligations
run
to
the
beneficiaries,
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
even
more
than
that,
not
just
that
there's
no
remedy.
you
say
there's
been
no
right
violated,
that
1109
establishes
a
fiduciary
duty
to
the
plan
but
not
to
the
individual
members
of
the
plan.
you
say
there's
no
fiduciary
duty
of
these
individuals
that's
been
violated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
just
that
it's
been
violated
but
there's
no
remedy
for
it.
you
say
there's
been
no
violation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
duties
as
set
forth
in
1109.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
1104.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
mean
to...
i
thought
that
there
is
a
piece
of
paper,
questions
and
answers,
what
happens
to
my
plan
benefits,
pension,
et
cetera?
answer:
when
you
transfer
to
mcc
they
will
stay
the
same,
et
cetera.
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
it
says
we
are
very
optimistic,
our
company
has
a
bright
future,
we
are,
et
cetera.
so
it
comes
in
a
context,
i
thought
your
point
was.
the
question:
what
happens
to
my
benefits?
when
you
answer
that
question,
you
are
answering
in
your
capacity
as
administrator.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
question
on
that
point
is
simply
that
the
ponit
about
the
massey
combines
corp.
comes
in
response
to
the
next
question
and
on
a
separate
page,
so
is
he
still
answering
with
his
hat
as
the
fiduciary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i'm...
that's
not
correct,
that's
a
question.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
you
were
starting
on
that
you'd
say,
look,
404
says
a
fiduciary
has
obligations
to
participants
and
beneficiaries.
it
doesn't
speak
of
obligations
to
a
plan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
trustee
has
obligations
to
the
fiduciaries
and
participants.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
when
you
looked
at
the
remedial
part
it
would
look
as
if
(1)
is
somewhat
special.
you
sue
under
(1)
to
get
benefits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
sue
under
(2)
where
there's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation,
and
you
sue
under
(3)
for
some
other
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
they're
worried
about
is,
they're
saying
russell
blocks
(2),
and
(3)
never
covered
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
isn't
it
easier
to
say
(2)
does
cover
fiduciary--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
409
covers
certain
obligations
to
individuals?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that.
i'm
saying
(2)
covers
fiduciaries,
breaches
of
fiduciary
relationship,
but
some
of
those
breaches
of
fiduciary
relationship
to
individuals
like
this
case
where
not
covered
elsewhere
may
be
picked
up,
too,
and
not
blocked.
i
mean,
it's
russell.
i'm
still
trying
to
get
you
to
talk
about
russell
and
the
relationship
to
(3).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
blocked
in
russell
by
other
things
in
the
act.
blocked
in
russell
by
the
fact
that
there's
a
whole
scheme
of
how
you
get--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what
they're
worried
about
there,
the
amici,
is
if
we
say
that,
we
open
the
thing
up
to
suits
in
every
case
where
a
beneficiary
is
deprived
of
an
operation,
or
whatever,
and
then
they
bring...
come
in
under
(3)
and
they
sue,
you
see,
you
breached
your
fiduciary
obligation
to
me.
that's
worried
about,
that
interpretation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
look,
somebody
comes
in,
my
heart
operation,
give
me
an
injunction.
trustee:
hey,
this
doesn't
require
it.
person:
you
breached
your
fiduciary
obligation
in
not
giving
me
my
heart
operation.
injunction,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing
they're
worried--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
basically
an
erisa
case
in
which
a
group
of
employees
said
that
the
employer
had
tricked
them
out
of
their
benefits.
the
way
this
trick
worked
was
that
the
employer
had
a
lot
of
losing
assets
in
different
corporations
and
his
idea
was
to
transfer
them
all
into
one
sub-corporation
which
then
might
go
bankrupt
and
all
his
bad
debts
would
be
gotten
rid
off.
one
set
of
bad
debts
were
the
promises
that
he
made
to
his
employees
to
pay
their
medical
benefits
but
in
order
to
make
the
transfer,
he
had
to
get
their
consent,
and
what
he
did
was
have
people
tell
that
the
set
of
stories
about
how
marvelous
this
new
corporation
would
be
which
according
to
the
employees
in
the
court
was
all
untrue.
they
shifted,
the
corporation
went
bankrupt,
they
lost
their
non-pension
benefits
and
they
brought
suit.
now,
that
was
the
very
bad
activity
on
the
employer’s
part,
but
the
issue
before
use
as
whether
or
not
it
violated
erisa,
the
employment
retirement
income
security
act,
and
to
answer
that
question,
we
have
to
deal
with
three
legal
questions.
the
first
is,
was
the
employer,
when
he
made
all
these
statements
to
the
employees
about
how
marvelous
this
corporation
would
be,
speaking
his
capacity
as
employer
or
speaking
in
his
capacity
as
the
fiduciary
under
erisa.
we
decided
that
after
looking
at
all
of
the
records
that
in
fact,
he
was
speaking
in
relevant
part
in
his
capacity
as
erisa
fiduciary,
so
that
so
far
is
under
the
act.
the
second
part
question
was,
whether
or
not
this
activity,
namely
telling
a
lot
of
false
stories,
violated
his
fiduciary
duty
under
erisa,
and
we
have
concluded
that
it
did
violate
a
fiduciary
duty.
and
the
third
which
is
even
more
technical
was,
whether
or
not
the
employees
could
bring
a
lawsuit
under
a
particular
provision
of
erisa
that
allowed
people
participant
in
programs
to
obtain
an
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
violations
of
erisa.
now
you
would
have
thought
that
answer
would
obviously
be
yes
because
that
is
what
the
language
said
but
it
was
not
that
clear
because
of
other
cases
in
their
court
and
because
of
other
sections
of
the
act
that
suggested
only
a
plan
to
bring
a
lawsuit
under
that
provision
rather
employees
themselves.
well
after
going
through
it,
we
concluded
that
this
provision
in
fact
did
allow
employees
themselves
also
to
bring
suit
for
violation
for
fiduciary
obligations.
though
we
do
not
think
that
holding
opens
erisa
to
all
kinds
of
lawsuits
for
fiduciary
violations
for
all
kinds
of
activities
because
of
certain
limiting
principles
that
we
have
written
into
the
opinion.
therefore
we
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision
that
the
employees
could
bring
this
lawsuit.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
o’connor
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
