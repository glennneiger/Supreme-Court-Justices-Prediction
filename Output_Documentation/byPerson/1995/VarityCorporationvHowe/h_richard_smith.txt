mr.
h.
richard
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
respond
to
some
of
the
things
petitioner
has
argued.
this
is
not
a
termination
case.
they
do
not
have
an
inherent
right
to
terminate.
they
must
proceed
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
and
that
has
not
been
done.
section
404
subparagraph
(d)
makes
it
a
fiduciary
duty
that
they
proceed
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
the
plan
that
they
were
on
with
mf,
inc.,
the
viable
plan
continues
today,
and
they've
taken
no
action
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
in
fact,
the
mcc
plan
they've
taken
no
action.
what
happened,
it
was
a
self-funded
plan.
the
self
went
bankrupt.
secondly--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--the
statute
did,
justice,
and
they
could
have
been,
and
they
chose
not
to
do
that
to
further
their
own
interests.
as
the
district
court
found
under
facts
that
are
not
challenged
on
the
appeal,
there
were
practical
reasons
why
petitioner
did
not
want
to
proceed
under
the
plan,
and
they
used
these
people
in
an
improper,
unlawful
way,
and
the
fact
that
they
could
do
it
lawfully
should
not
be
justification
for
permitting
them
to
do
it
unlawfully.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
that's
correct,
if
i
understand
it,
and
that
moves
us
to
what
our
(a)(1)(b)
claim
was.
we
have
not
been
denied
benefits
under
our
(a)(1)(b)
claim.
our
(a)(1)(b)
claim
was
a
security
claim.
we
took
the
position
that
our
retirement
benefits
contractually
vested
on
retirement
under
the
section
7.4
of
the
plan.
we
read
it,
we
thought
you
could
read
it
that
way,
and
the
court
held
we
were
wrong,
but
the
court
neither
at
the
district
court
nor
at
the
circuit
court
level
has
found
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
benefits
under
(a)(1)(b).
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
be
restored
to
the
viable
plan
that
we
removed
ourselves
from
due
to
the
fraudulent
misrepresentations.
we
want
to
get
restored
to
that
plan,
and
then--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--exactly,
justice.
we
did
argue
it
under
other
theories,
but
not
under
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
we
argued
it
and
lost,
but
we
do
not
argue
it
here.
it's
not
part
of
our
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
claim.
our
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
claim
is
not
attacking
plan
documents.
we
don't
attempt
to
change
or
circumvent
any
of
those
term
plans.
all
we're
trying
to
do,
again
because
we
were
fraudulently
removed
from
the
viable
plan,
to
get
restored
so
we
can
have
relief
in
accord
with
those
plan
documents.
the
other
thing
that
i...
there's
no
record,
but
since
it
came
in
in
petitioner's
argument
about
our
state
court
claim,
that's
based
on
the
terminated
class
which
we
lost
on
in
the
district
court,
and
seeking
a
common
law
actions
for
wrongful
termination,
and
i
was
surprised
to
hear
that
they
do
not
claim
that
that's
preempted,
because
they
removed
it
to
federal
court
on
the
basis
of
preemption.
i
don't
think
it
has
any
bearing
on
our
case
here
today.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
i--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--justice,
i
agree
with
the
first
part.
there
were
no
representations
of
any
nature
made
to
them,
but
that's
not
justifications
that
they
have
no
relief.
that's
justification
for
once
you
get
by
the
first
question,
petitioners
have
advanced
no
reason
or
make
no
argument
to
deny
the
10
individuals,
because
clearly
it's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
under
section
404(d)
for
them
to
proceed
to
unilaterally,
without
informing
them,
without
their
consent,
to
transfer
responsibility
for
their
benefits
to
an
entity
that
the
district
court
found
they
knew
was
going
to
go
bankrupt.
so
our
position
is
that
if
we
prevail
on
the
first
question
for
review,
we're
home
free
with
regard
to
the
10
individual
plaintiffs,
because
they've
not
advanced
any
argument
why
there
was
not
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
i
would
like
to
direct
attention
to
the
first
question
for
review,
and
as
you
know,
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
petitioners
are
right
in
their
interpretation
of
502(a)(3),
there
is
a
tremendous
gap
in
this
well-crafted
scheme
that
the
courts
recognized
that
congress
devised
for
enforcement
and
remedies,
and
that
gap
is,
as
has
been
pointed
out
here
this
morning,
that
you
have
no
remedy
for
breaches
of
fiduciary
duties
that
results
in
harm
to
participants
or
beneficiaries
but
no
losses
to
the
plan,
and
that
takes
out
practically
all
of
the
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
relating
to
administration.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
well,
it
would...
assuming
it
constitutes
a
breach
of
contract
that
you
could
under
contract
principles
recover
(a)(1)(b),
but
justice,
there's
many
other
things...
in
fact,
one
of
the
most
fundamental
things
about
administration
is
determining
who
is
a
participant
that
has
a
right
to
make
claims
under
(a)(1)(b),
and
you
have
these--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--justice,
it's
just
not
common
sense
that
if
congress
intended
the
exclusive
remedy
for
private
harm
to
participants
and
beneficiaries
to
be
under
(a)(1)(b)
on
contract
principles,
why
would
they
make
administration
a
fiduciary
activity,
why
would
they
make
it
fiduciary
conduct,
why
would
they
incorporate
in
section
404
duties
out
of
the
common
law
that
run
directly
to
beneficiaries,
and
having
done
all
that,
why
would
they--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--for...
where
we--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--that's
correct.
if
we're
talking
about
titles,
we'd
prefer
to
go
back
to
the
subchapter
which
says,
protection
of
employee
benefit
rights,
if
the
court's
going
to
focus
on
titles,
but
where
we
differ
from
mr.
abramson,
or
petitioner's
counsel
on
that
is,
404
sets
up
the
duties.
his
position
is
that
409
limits
what...
where
you
can
have
liability
for
breaches
of
those
duties.
i
don't
know
that
they
dispute...
in
fact,
i
think
they
argue
that
duties
were
incorporated
out
of
common
law.
they
try
to
argue
that
the
remedies
were
not
incorporated,
which
again
just
doesn't
make
sense.
if
congress
had
intended
409
to
be
the
exclusive
means
of
remedies
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
they
could
have
said
so,
and
they
do
not.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
yes,
and
i'm
pausing...
i
know
mertens
was
a
nonfiduciary.
i
think
russell
was
a
fiduciary,
so
yes,
i
think
they
could
have
for
equitable
relief.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
i
don't
think
they
could
have
recovered
damages
under
502(a)(3).
mr.
h.
richard
smith
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
that's
right,
and
we
can
only
obtain
equitable
relief
under
502(a)(3).
we--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--correct.
they
have
not
brought
that
to
you.
we--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--justice
hanson
at
the
circuit
level
in
the
dissent
had
some
thoughts
along
that
line
and
wanted
it
sent
back
to
have
a
better
record
developed
on
that.
our
position
is,
as
you
know
from
the
briefs,
that
you
should
follow
the
number
1,
what
you've
said
is
the
cardinal
rule
of
statutory
construction,
and
that
is,
when
the
language
used
by
congress
is
plain,
you
should
assume
congress
means
what
they
said
and
said
what
they
mean,
and
judicial
inquiry
should
stop
there,
and
we
think
the
language
of
502(a)(3)
is
clear.
petitioners
say,
but
when
you
read
it
in
the
context
of
the
entire
act,
there's
a
conflict
between
it
and
409.
there
is
not.
you
have
to
read
language
into
409,
that
language
being
that
it
is
exclusive.
it
doesn't
say
that.
or
language
that
says
you
can
only
find...
have
plan-based
relief
and
not
individual
relief.
they
say,
but
the
russell
decision
puts
that
language
in
there.
it
does
not.
the
russell
court
made
clear
that
502(a)(3)
had
not
been
urged
upon
it
in
that
case.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
well,
that's
correct,
and
the
concurring
opinion
points
that
out,
that
it's
broader
than
it
needs
be,
but
i
think
that
can
be
explained
by
the
argument
that
was
being
presented
to
get
a
private
cause
of
action
under
409,
where
they
were
focusing
on...
they
recognized
it
said,
losses
to
the
plan,
so
they
focused
on
the
catch-all
at
the
end
that
said,
other
equitable
or
remedial
relief,
and
they
said
that
means
that
congress
wanted
to
have
private
cause
of
actions
there,
and
i
believe
it
was
in
that
context
that
the
court
used
that
broader
language
as
it
did.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
that's
right.
with
regard
to
the
second
question
for
review,
i
was
pleased
to
hear
petitioner
say
that
this
isn't
a
disclosure
case.
this
is
a
duty
of
honesty
case.
while
this
court
may
choose
to
speak
to
a
broader
duty,
all
that's
required
to
affirm
in
this
case
is
to
find
that
when
an
employer
administrator
of
a
plan
exercises
its
discretion
to
speak
to
its
employee
participants
about
administration
plan
benefits,
it
has
a
duty
to
be
honest,
and
that's
not
a
burdensome
duty.
there's
been
a
lot
of
concerns
raised
in
petitioner
and
amici's
brief
about
the
burden
this
is
going
to
place
on
employers.
this
is
not
a
clairvoyance
case.
that
simple
minimal
rule
that
the
circuit
could
be
affirmed
on
doesn't
require
clairvoyance
to
speak
about
future
events.
here,
the
district
court--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--we--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--you're
exactly
right,
and
we
don't
base
it
being
fiduciary
conduct
and
that
they
were
acting
as
a
fiduciary
because
they
lied,
although
i
think
that
could
be
a
legitimate
basis.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
well--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--justice,
that
two
hats
doctrine,
they
always
have
both
hats
in
their
hand.
they
put
one
on
to
speak
as
an
employer
as
a
nonfiduciary,
but
they're
lying
in
a
manner
that
they...
it's
reasonably
foreseeable
that
the
participants
are
going
to
act
on
it
to
their
detriment.
they
hear
that
as
a
fiduciary.
they
have
a
duty
to
put
the
other
hat
on
and
say,
participants,
you're
not
being
told
the
truth,
but
that's
not
our
case,
of
course,
because
the
district
court
found--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--for
purpose
of
affirming,
i
do...
we
do
not
urge
the
rule
that
it
be
based
on
lying.
it's
based
on
whether
or
not
they're
talking
about
plan
administration
or
plan
benefits.
that
should
be
the
rule,
and
when
they
do,
they're
acting
as
a
fiduciary,
and
they
have
a
duty
to
be
honest.
in
this
case
the
unchallenged
factual
findings
are
that
they
were
talking
about
benefits,
they
were
talking
about
plan
administration.
given
those
findings,
it
necessarily
has
to
be
that
they
were
acting
as
a
fiduciary.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
you
have
the
words
that
they
said--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--they
said--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--your
benefits
will
continue
unchanged.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
well,
it
certainly
is.
they
did
not
remain
unchanged.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
no,
we
didn't...
if
i
said
plan
benefits,
i
misspoke,
because
we
agreed
we're
not
attacking
the
plans.
we're
talking
about
administration
and
benefits,
and
we
told...
not
talking
about
plan
terms,
but
we're
talking
about
benefits
continuing
in
the
future
with
this
new
corporation
which
had
such
a
bright
future
and
excitement
they
had
about
how
it
was
going
to
do.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
exactly,
justice--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--and
it
was
in
the
four
documents
that
was
presented
to
them--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--that's
exactly
right,
and
it's
in
that
context
and
in
the
context
that
in
the
short,
brief
meeting
they
said,
you
need
to
sign
this
today
to
transfer
so
you
be
sure
those
benefits
will
not
be
interrupted.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
smith
you're
asking
that
if,
when
they
switch
over
to
talking
about
the
business
matters,
that
they're
still
talking
about,
and
i
say
yes,
that's
true,
they're
still
talking
as
a
beneficiary.
you
have
to
set
this
in
the
context
of
the
factual
findings,
unchallenged,
that
they
wanted
to
rid
themselves
of
these
without
exercising
their
right
of
termination,
and
they
had
a
second
and
dual
purpose
of,
they
wanted
to
persuade
their
lenders
that
they
had
an
up
and
going
viable
entity,
and
in
that
setting,
where
they
talked
about
the
benefits
and
then
talked
about
the
prospects
of
the
entity
that
was
going
to
be
the
source
of
the
funds
to
fund
this
self-funded
plan,
that
was
all,
in
our
judgment,
fiduciary
conduct,
and
again,--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--that's--
mr.
h.
richard
smith
--that's
correct.
