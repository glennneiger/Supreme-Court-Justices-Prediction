then
there's
always
going
to
be
the
potential
for
a
hiatus
in
recovery,
because
the
plan
is
going
to
do
very
well
by
getting
rid
of
these
people.
the
plan
as
a
plan
has
no
obligation,
i
suppose,
to
claim
any
harm,
and
the
individuals,
on
your
theory,
can't
sue.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
would
sue...
on
your
theory,
he
would
sue...
the
fiduciary
and
require
the
fiduciary
to
pay
him
benefits
month--
justice
david
h.
souter
--by
month?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
after
they
stopped
getting
benefits,
in
answer
to
my
earlier
question
you
said,
well,
they
can
sue
for
benefits,
and
now
you're
saying,
but
they're
not
entitled
to
any
benefits.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
practical
matter
is,
there's
nothing
to
sue
for.
there
is
no
alternative--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
what
they're
claiming
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
get's
back,
i
guess,
to
my
question,
and
that
is
for
the
particular
claim
that
is
being
made
here,
there
is
no
remedy.
there
is
in
fact
a
gap
in
the
possibility
of
recovery,
because
the
plan
is
doing
fine.
it
could
care
less
that
it
has
to
pay
fewer
benefits,
and
the
individuals,
on
your
theory,
have
nothing
that
they
can
recover
for.
end
of
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
isn't
there
sort
of
a
common
sense
of
plan
administration
that
the
plan
is
going
to
be
better
administered
for
those
whom
it
will
benefit
if
it
has
fewer
people
to
benefit,
and
therefore
there
is
a
good
administrative
objective,
i
suppose,
in
theory,
in
simply
reducing
the
plan's
liabilities.
and
if
these
statements
were
made
about
the
new
corporation
and
its
rosy
future
and
so
on
for
the
purpose,
or
in
part
for
the
purpose
of
causing
this
exodus
out
of
the
old
plan
and
the
reduction
of
the
old
plan's
liabilities,
why
doesn't
that
fit
within
a
concept
of
administrative
purpose?
you
make
it
easier
for
the
old
plan
to
pay
its
benefits
because
you've
got
fewer
benefits
to
pay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
think
we
know
whether
it
tortures
it
or
not
unless
we
first
answer
the
question,
and
i
guess
it's
the
question
which
was
behind
one
of
justice
ginsburg's
questions
to
you,
should
we
read
the
concept
of
plan
administration,
if
in
doubt,
in
a
more
expansive
or
a
less
expansive
way,
and
her
suggestion
was
that
there
is
an
overarching
object
in
the
statute
which
would
be
a
good
reason
for
reading
it
in
an
expansive
way
which
would
bring
these
acts
within
the
concept
of
administration,
and
i
guess
your
answer
is
going
to
be
the
same
as
to
her,
there
is
no
overarching
scheme
by
which
you
can
make
that
choice.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
don't
argue
that
you
were
guaranteed
any
benefits
under
that
plan,
do
you?
i
take
it
your
position
is
not
that
you
were
guaranteed
benefits
of
which
you
were
deprived,
but
that
you
simply
had
benefits
of
which
you
were
fraudulently
deprived.
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
misrepresentation
is
not
that
the
new
piece
of
paper
on
which
the
new
plan
is
written
has
the
same
words
as
the
old
piece
of
paper.
your
claim
is
that
the
misrepresentation
was,
you're
going
to
continue
to
enjoy
them
with
the
same
probability
or
expectation
that
you
would
enjoy
them
if
you
remained
under
the
old
plan.
that's
the
nub
of
your
claim,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
was
because...
i
think
you're
saying
it
would
have
been
very
odd...
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
for
employees
to
say,
oh,
now
that
he's
talking
about
the
rosy
future,
he's
not
making
any
statement
that
might
be
relevant
to
my
decision
about
joining
the
new
plan.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
nub
of
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
plan
is
he
administering?
he's
administering
the
first
plan
when
he
makes
the
misrepresentation,
isn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
he's
administering
both.
what
if
you
assume...
just
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
he's
administering
the
first
plan.
i
threw
out
a
suggestion
which
mr.
abrams
said
was...
really
relied
on
too
high
a
level
of
generality
of
the
concept
of
administration.
what's
your
theory
of
the
administrative
character
of...
with
respect
to
the
first
plan
in
making
statements
intended
to
induce
people
to
leave
that
plan?
how
does
that
relate
to
administration,
on
your
theory?
