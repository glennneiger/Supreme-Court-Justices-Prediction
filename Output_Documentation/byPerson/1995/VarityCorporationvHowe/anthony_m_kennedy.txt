under
your
view
of
404,
mr.
abrams,
does
the
fiduciary
have
an
obligation
to
refrain
from
giving
fraudulent
information
to
a
person
who
requests
information
about
the
future
of
the
plan
and
the
advisability
of
the
participant
remaining
in
the
plan?
justice

it
seems
to
me
that
on
this
part
of
your
argument
what
you're
saying
is,
is
that
the
defendants
below
are
wearing
their
corporate
executive
hat--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
not
their
fiduciary
hat.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
they
mislead,
and
they
then
mislead
about
the
participation
in
the
plan,
the
solvency
of
the
plan,
the
future
of
the
plan,
and
so
forth,
it
seems
to
me
the
very
fact
that
they're
misleading
helps
us
to
determine
which
hat
that
they're
wearing,
because
the
employee
has
the
justified
expectation
that
he
or
she
will
receive
accurate
information
about
the
plan
whenever
the
fiduciary
talks,
no
matter
what
his
hat
is.
