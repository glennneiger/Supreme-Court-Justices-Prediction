h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-1471,
varity
corporation
v
charles
howe.
mr.
abrams,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
abrams,
in
your
view,
if
you
prevail
here,
would
the
respondents
have
some
sort
of
remedy
for
these
rather
obviously
fraudulent
statements?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
position
is
that
those
claims
are
preempted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
abrams.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
some...
certainly
some
language
in
russell
that
suggests
the
plaintiffs
wouldn't
have
fared
any
better
under
502(a)(3).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
abrams,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94-1471,
varity
corp.
against
howe
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
