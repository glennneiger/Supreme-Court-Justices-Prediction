mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
just
to
put
in
context
the
nature
of
the
fiduciary
breach
claim
here,
we
think
it
is
precisely
as
justice
souter
stated
it.
the
statement
that
plan
benefits
will
remain
unchanged
might
have
accurately
described
the
plan
on
paper,
but
a
plan
in
the
real
world
consists
of
more
than
just
the
paper
the
document
is
written
on.
it
consists
of
the
funds
that
will
be
available
to
pay
the
benefits,
and
in
this
case
it's
the
same,
analytically,
as
if
the
welfare
benefits
were
paid
out
of
a
separate
corpus,
and
it
would
take
50
million
dollars
to
fund
the
benefits,
but
the
employer
had
only
put
1,000
into
it.
if
the
employer
said,
your
benefits
will
remain
unchanged,
and
the
plan
looked
the
same
on
paper,
that
would
not
be
a
fully
accurate
description
to
the
employees
who
were
being
induced
to
leave
a
secure
plan
to
go
to
an
unsecure
plan
to
say
that
their
benefits
have
remained
unchanged.
so
this
was
quite
clearly
a
representation
about
the
current
status
of
the
benefit
plan.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
now,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
understand
that.
i
was
simply
trying
to
describe
what
the
nature
of
the
misrepresentation
was,
but
by
the
same
token,
when
an
employer
wearing
two
hats
is
asked
to
describe
what
the
employees'
benefits
will
be
under
the
current
plan,
this
is
not
a
statement
of
an
intent
to
amend
the
plan
in
the
future.
this
is
a
statement
of
what
employees'
benefits
are
or
will
be
under
the
current
plan.
this
is
a
statement
of
current
plan
benefits
availability.
in
that
situation
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
employer
is
speaking
in
a
fiduciary
capacity,
or
at
least
would
be
understood
by
the
reasonable
employees
in
a
meeting
such
as
this,
where
the
employer
through
all
of
the
communications
constantly
referred
to
the
benefit
consequences
of
the
switch,
that
the
employer...
employees
were
being
spoken
to
about
their
benefits,
which
is
after
all
a
classic
administrator
responsibility
under
the
act.
it
is
the
administrator
of
the
plan
that
is
responsible
for
disclosing
documents
to
plan
participants,
these
summary
plan
description
and
notice
of
material
modifications,
so
that
the
employees
would
have
been
used
to,
and
in
fact
in
this
case
did
receive
their
communications
about
plan
benefits--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--from
the
employer.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not...
certainly
not
as
a
general
matter.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
our
position
is
not
that
that's
true
as
a
general
matter.
in
the
borst
case,
for
example,
where
the
employer
is
not
speaking
to
the
employees
but
speaking
in
another
context,
there's
certainly
no
duty
to
disclose,
but
where
the
employer
is
having
a
meeting
face-to-face
with
the
employees,
asking
them
to
switch
from
one
arm
of
the
company
to
another,
and
talking
about
the
benefit
consequences
of
that,
we
believe
that
that
is
plan
participation,
where
the
viability
of
the
company
is
the
same
as
saying
there
won't
be
funds
available
to
pay
the
benefits.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
when
he
is
speaking
to
the
employees
about
what's
going
to
happen
to
them
under
the
plan--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
frankly
think
he's
administering
both
plans.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
ordinarily,
when
an
administrator
has
people
sign
up
or
exit
a
plan,
it
may
be
incident
to
leaving
employment,
but
it's
typical
fiduciary
responsibility
for...
to
handle
the
paperwork
coming
and
going
from
a
plan,
and
that's
what
we
think
would
have
been
happening
here,
that
the
fiduciary
under
the
existing
plan
would
have
been
describing
or
been
understood
by
the
employers
to
be
describing
the
benefit
consequences
of
leaving
one
plan
run
by
mf
and
joining
another
plan,
essentially
run
by
mf,
so
we
think
that
the
employer
was
really
wearing
an
administrative
hat
under
both
plans
at
the
time
it
was
speaking.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
we
don't.
first
of
all,
the
court
in
footnote
5
of
russell
specifically
noted
that
the
employee...
that
the
participant
there
was
not
suing
under
502(a)(3).
it
was
suing
under--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
the
damages
that
were
being
sought
there.
that
was
straight
compensatory
damages,
and
we
think
that's
significant
in
looking
at
the
operation
of
502(a)(3).
since
russell
was
decided,
this
court
held
in
mertens
that
other
appropriate
equitable
relief
does
not
include
compensatory
damages,
so
the
relief
available
under
502(a)(3)
is
considerably
more
limited
than
what
would
be
available
for
compensatory
damages
claimed
in
russell
or
under
section
409
of
the
plan
on
behalf
of
the
plan,
so
we
think
that
that
explains
the
differences
between
502(a)(2)
and
502(a)(3).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
you
sue
under--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
what
they're
saying,
but
we
think
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--409...
no,
40...
excuse
me,
404
covers
obligations
to
individuals.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it's
possible
that
the
concluding
clause
in
409
could
have
been
understood
to
be
available
to
individuals
to
sue,
but
the
court
concluded
that
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--for
benefits.
that's
exactly
right,
and
we
think
that's
significant,
but
the
court
does
not
have
to
revisit
russell,
because
502(a)(3)
provides
for
equitable
relief
for
violation
of
any
provision
of
title
i,
any
violation
of
any
provision
of
title
i.
that
by
its
terms
includes
section
404.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
because
the
remedy
under
502(a)(3)
is
limited
by
virtue
of
mertens,
there
will
be
a
self-limiting
principle
applicable
there.
where
you
have
an
intentional
misrepresentation,
as
there
was
here,
where
the
employer
stands
to
gain--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
don't
think
there's
any
inconsistency
at
all
with
the
benefit
provision,
because
the
employer...
the
employer
pays
benefits
under
the
act
either
because
they're
covered
or
they're
not
covered.
if
the
employer
has
authority
under
a
group
to
interpret
the
plan,
then
that
would
be
reviewed
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
that
abuse
of
discretion
is
the
ambit
of
the
fiduciary's...
fiduciary
responsibilities.
there
would
be
no
separate
claim
under
502(a)(3).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
i
meant
to
say
is,
there
would
not
be
an
inconsistent
result.
it
would
be
the
same
result,
because
the
fiduciary
standards
would
be
the
same
under
each.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
in
that
situation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
that
situation,
if
you
get
exactly
the
same
relief,
it
wouldn't
increase
the
litigation
at
all.
if
i
could
say,
petitioner's
theory
is
that
somehow
502(a)(1),
(2),
(3),
(4),
(5)
are
airtight
compartments,
and
there's
no
overlap.
that's
not
true.
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
(a)(1)
and
(a)(3),
both
of
which
refer
to
violations
of
the
plan.
(a)(1)
refers
to
specific
violations
with
respect
to
not
paying
benefits,
but
502(a)(3)
also
includes
other
violations
of
the
plan,
and
we're
saying
the
same
thing
here
with
respect
to
fiduciary
obligations.
502(a)(2)
specifically
covers
personal
liability
and
other
equitable
relief
for
the
fiduciary
to
the
plan,
but
that
doesn't
detract
from
the
fact
that
502(a)(3)
also
covers
any
violation
of
the
act
which
includes
the
fiduciary
responsibility
provisions.
under
petitioner's
theory,
the
injunctive
suit
that
justice
o'connor
referred
to
wouldn't
even
lie.
the
10
people
who
were
transferred
to
the
new
plan
would
not
even
have
an
action
for
injunctive
relief
to
restore
them
to
the
old
plan.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
think
that
the
preemption
question
has
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
availability
of
the
remedies
under
section
502,
as
the
court
suggested
in
russell,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
the
cause
of
action
lies
here,
there
would
not
be
preemption.
if
the
cause
of
action
does
not...
excuse
me,
there
would
be
preemption.
if
the
cause
of
action
does
not
lie
under
erisa,
then
we
think
there
should
be
a
broader
ambit
of
claims
for
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
for
misrepresentations
about
benefit
where
that's
an
inducement
for
an
employment
change.
