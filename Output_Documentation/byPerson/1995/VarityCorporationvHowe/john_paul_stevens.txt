justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
technical
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
dispute,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
relief
granted
in
this
case
was
(2)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
argue
it's
not
appropriate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this:
do
you
contend
that
the
breach
of
fiduciary
obligations
that
you
have
proved
in
this
case,
or
alleged,
were
violations
of
duties
defined
in
404?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
say
that
404
is
the
source
of
the
fiduciary
duty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
but
then,
may
i
ask
this
question.
if
your
reading
of
subsection
(a)
of
502(a)(3),
i
should...
mean,
is
correct,
would
the
plaintiffs
in
the
russell
case
have
been
able
to
prevail
if
they
had
pleaded
under
this
section
rather
than
just
under
subparagraph
(2)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
were
suing
for
damages
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
one
of
the
keys
to
your
case
is
that
you
contend
here
you're
getting
equitable
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
distinguishes
russell.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
could
i
ask
you
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
started
out...
started
the
argument
with?
in
your
view,
if
your
opponent
prevailed
in
this
case,
would
their
state
law
actions
that
they
described
be
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what's
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
would
not
be
preemption,
you
think.
