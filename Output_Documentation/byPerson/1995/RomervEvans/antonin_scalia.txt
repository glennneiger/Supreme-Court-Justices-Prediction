justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tymkovich,
what
about
laws
prohibiting
bigamy,
or
prohibiting
homosexuality,
or
homosexual
conduct?
incidentally,
how
do
you
interpret
the
bisexual
orientation
language,
homosexual,
lesbian,
or
bisexual
orientation?
does
that
require
any
conduct,
or
is
it
just
a
disposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
know
what
you
mean
by...
what
is
meant
by...
if
all
orientation
means
is
someone
who
engages
in
homosexual,
lesbian,
or
bisexual
acts,
then
you
have
plenty
of
precedent
in
response
to
your
question,
namely
state
laws
that
absolutely
criminalize
such
activity...
bigamy,
homosexuality--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
no
position
on
it?
you
have
no
position
on
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
talk
about
special
protection,
this
brings
me
back
to
an
earlier
question
about
discrimination
in
libraries.
what...
how
do
you
interpret
the
term,
minority
status
quota
preferences
protected
status?
you
mean...
what
does
that
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
special
protection
beyond
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
why
wouldn't
that
have
been
your
answer
to
the
library
hypothetical
that
was
produced
earlier?
any...
no
homosexual
can
be
treated
differently
from
other
people.
he
simply
cannot
be
given
special
protection
by
reason
of
that
status.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tymkovich,
if
this
is
an
ordinary
equal
protection
challenge
and
there's
no
heightened
scrutiny,
isn't
it
an
adequate
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
to
say
this
is
the
only
area
in
which
we've
had
a
problem?
if
localities
started
passing
special
laws
giving
favored
treatment
to
people
with
blue
eyes,
we
might
have
a
statewide
referendum
on
that
as
well?
isn't
one
step
at
a
time
a
normal
response
to
equal
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
state...
state
subdivisions
giving
preferences
which
the
majority
of
the
people
in
the
state
did
not
think
desirable
for
social
reasons,
isn't
that
the
problem
that
was
seen?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
they
should
start
giving
preferences
for
some
other
reason
that
the
majority
of
the
state
did
not
consider
desirable...
let's
say,
bigamy,
special
preferences
to
bigamist
couples,
there
would
be
a
law
on
that
subject
as
well.
isn't
your
answer,
this
is
the
only
area
where
the
people
apparently
saw
a
problem,
which
is
enough
for
equal
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tymkovich,
i
assume
in
your
state
you're
not
allowed
to
bash
nongays
either,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
prohibiting
the
bashing
of
gays
would
not
be
a
special
protection,
would
it?
it
would
just
be
enforcing
the
general
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
response
to
justice--
--but
does
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that
in
the
colorado
supreme
court's
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
b
3?
what
does
it
say
on
b
3
that
says
that?
is
it
b--
--it...
b
3...
you
said
b
as
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--boy.
it
seems
to
me
it
says
the
effect,
the
ultimate
effect
is
to
prohibit
any
government
entity
from
adopting
similar
or
more
protective
statutes,
regulations,
or
orders
in
the
future.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
that
barred
discrimination
based
on
sexual
orientation.
i
assume
that
that
means
special
provisions
giving
special
protection--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
opposed
to
a
general
law
that
says
you
have
to,
not
just
accept
homosexuals,
but
all
citizens
have
to
be
accommodated
at
hotels.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
opposed
to
a
special
law
that
says
a
private
homeowner
who
wants
to
rent
a
room...
you
know,
the
mom
and
a
family
that
wants
to
do
bed
and
breakfast
cannot
discriminate
in
the
people
it
accepts.
although
it
has
no
obligation
to
take
the
public
at
large,
it
can
decide
to
take
only
irishmen
if
it
wants,
but
it
cannot
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
homosexuality.
i
thought
that's
the
kind
of
thought
the
court
is
referring
to
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
no
general
laws
can
be
applied
to
homosexuals
now?
they
can
be
bashed,
they
can
be
murdered,
they...
all
sorts
of
things.
is
that
what
it
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
the
colorado
supreme
court
did
interpret
it
that
broadly.
i
think
they
interpreted
it
to
refer
to
special
protections
accorded
to
homosexuals
and
not
to
the
public
at
large.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
if
i
go
and
ask
a
homeowner
to
take
me
in
on
bed
and
breakfast
and
the
homeowner
says,
i
don't
like
italians,
that's
my
tough
luck,
unless
there's
a
law
against
it.
it's
that
person's
house,
and
that
person
is
entitled
not
to
like
italians
and
not
to
rent
rooms
to
italians.
that's
fine,
unless
there's
a
law
against
it,
and
you
can
have
such
a
law
prohibiting
the
rental
of
rooms,
or
refusal
to
rental
on
the
basis
of
racial
discrimination
or
on
the
basis
of
homosexuality,
if
you
want
to
make
that
a
category,
and
i
think
that
this
law
says,
no
special
protection
on
that
basis.
why
isn't
that
a
special
protection,
one
that
is
not
given
to
everyone?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you...
but
they
are
laws
that
provide
special
protection
for
that
particular
category
of
person,
which
they
don't
provide
to
people
at
large.
you
can
refuse
to
hire
someone
because
you
don't
like
the
way
he
combs
his
hair.
there's
no
law
that
says
combing
of
hair
is
not
a
proper
basis
of
discrimination.
if
you
don't
like
that,
you
can
refuse
to
hire
him.
special
protection
is
given
by
this
law
which
they
cite
by
reason
of
homosexual
orientation
or
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
not
special?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
that
you
take
the
position
that
there
are
no
applications
in
which
the
statute
can
be
constitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
there
are
no
applications
that
would
be
constitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
does
if
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
not
what
our
case
law
involving
facial
challenges
says.
if
you
wanted
to
wait
for
an
as
applied
challenge,
you
might
pick
an
unconstitutional
situation
and
litigate
that,
but
when
you
challenge
it
on
your...
on
its
face,
you
are
saying
that
in
all
of
its
applications
it
is
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
these
rules
on
24
and
25
don't,
as
i
understand
them,
prohibit
arbitrary
discrimination.
they
prohibit
discrimination
just
on
particular
grounds...
race,
sex,
homosexual
orientation,
not
how
you
comb
your
hair.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
do
apply
to
everyone,
but
they
only
apply
for
certain
reasons.
they
are
not
laws
that
say,
no
arbitrary
discrimination.
you
can
discriminate
on
very
arbitrary
bases,
just
not
those
particular
bases
listed.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
group
does
it
target?
i'm
asking
you
the
same
question
i
asked
the
attorney
general.
how
do
you
read
the
statute
when
it
refers
to
sexual
orientation,
homosexual,
lesbian,
or
bisexual
orientation,
conduct,
practices,
or
relationships?
suppose
a
person
who,
let's
say,
has
a
tendency
to
homosexual
conduct,
but
has
never
engaged
in
homosexual
conduct,
is
that
person...
would
an
ordinance
that
relates
to
that
person
be
covered
by
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
sure
it
is,
but
what
else?
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
what
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
beyond
homosexual
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
i
thought
that
there's
a
problem
with
orientation
but
not
a
problem
with
the
others,
do
you
win
or
lose
on
this
facial
challenge?
justice
antonin
scalia
--orientation,
people
who
do
not
engage
in
conduct
of
the
sort,
but
have
a
tendency
in
that
direction.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
find
that
it
would
be
valid
to
have
such
a
law
directed
at
conduct--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
not
at...
directed
at
something
other
than
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
lose?
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
you
say
it
has
no
valid
applications.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
dubofsky,
do
you
contend
that...
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
bowers
v.
hardwick?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
we
said
that
you
could
make
homosexual
conduct
criminal.
why
can
a
state
not
take
a
step
short
of
that
and
say,
we're
not
going
to
make
it
criminal,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
certainly
don't
want
to
encourage
it,
and
therefore
we
will
neither
have
a
state
law
giving
it
special
protection,
nor
will
we
allow
any
municipalities
to
give
it
special
protection.
it
seems
to
me
the
legitimacy
of
the
one
follows
from
the
legitimacy
of
the
other.
if
you
can
criminalize
it,
surely
you
can
take
that
latter
step,
can't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
do
you
do
it
when
you
throw
them
in
jail
for
a
felony?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
orientation,
now.
i'm
talking
about
conduct.
if
we
have
held
it
constitutional
to
make
the
conduct
criminal,
how
could
it
be
unconstitutional
to
go
so
much
short
of
that?
we
don't
want
to
get
into
the
hassle
of
intrusion
into
private
life,
and
all
of
that,
that
that
requires.
we're
not
going
to
criminalize
it.
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
not
think
it
is
conduct
that
ought
to
be
encouraged,
and
therefore
we
will
not
allow
any
special
protections
for
it,
neither
at
the
state
level,
nor
locally.
doesn't...
if
the
one
is
constitutional,
must
not
the
other
one
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
dissent
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
this
case.
justice
kennedy’s
description
of
the
court’s
opinion
said
that
the
court
found
it
implausible
that
the
colorado
constitutional
provision
in
question
prohibits
only
special
preference.
the
opinion
does
indeed
say
that
it
finds
it
implausible
but
goes
on
to
say
that
it
accepts
for
purposes
of
the
court’s
decision
that
that
is
all
that
the
constitutional
provision
prohibits
special
treatment
for
homosexuals.
i
think
that
is
in
fact
the
reality
of
the
matter
but
whether
is
it
or
not
the
court’s
opinion
accepts
it
to
be
true
and
my
remarks
take
into
account
that
acceptance.
the
only
denial
of
equal
treatment,
the
court
contend
homosexuals
has
suffered
is
this:
they
may
not
obtain
preferential
treatment
without
amending
the
state
constitution.
that
is
to
say
the
principle
underlying
the
court’s
opinion
is
that
one
who
is
accorded
equal
treatment
under
the
laws
but
cannot
as
readily
as
others
obtain
preferential
treatment
under
the
laws
has
been
denied
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
if
merely
stating
this
alleged
equal
protection
violation
does
not
suffice
to
receive
it,
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
have
achieved
terminal
silliness.
the
central
thesis
of
the
court’s
reasoning
is
that
any
group
is
denied
equal
protection
when
in
order
to
obtain
advantage
or
presumably
to
avoid
or
eliminate
disadvantage
it
must
have
recourse
to
a
more
general
and
hence
more
difficult
level
of
political
decision
making
than
other
citizens.
the
world
has
never
heard
of
such
a
principle
and
it
seems
to
me
most
unlikely
that
any
multilevel
democracy
can
possibly
function
under
such
a
principle.
for
whenever
a
disadvantage
is
imposed
or
conferral
of
the
benefit
is
prohibited,
at
one
of
the
higher
levels
of
democratic
decision
making,
i.e.
by
the
state
legislature
rather
than
local
government
or
by
the
people
at
large
in
the
state
constitution
rather
than
by
the
state
legislature,
the
affected
group
has
under
this
theory
automatically
been
denied
equal
protection.
the
court
gives
the
back
of
its
hand
to
the
usual
test
for
compliance
with
the
equal
protection
clause
whether
the
legislation
had
a
rational
basis.
it
is
unsurprising
that
the
court
avoids
discussion
of
this
question
since
the
answer
is
so
obviously
yes.
the
case
most
relevant
to
the
issue
before
us
today
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
court’s
opinion.
in
bowers
versus
hardwick,
decided
ten
years
ago,
we
held
that
constitution
does
not
prohibit
what
virtually
all
states
had
done
from
the
founding
of
the
republic
until
very
recent
years
namely
making
homosexual
conduct
a
crime.
that
holding
is
a
given
in
the
present
case.
respondents
did
not
urge
the
overruling
of
bowers
but
obviously
if
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
for
a
state
to
make
homosexual
conduct
criminal,
surely
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
for
a
state
to
enact
other
laws
merely
disfavoring
homosexual
conduct,
and
a
fortiori
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
for
a
state
to
adapt
the
provision
not
even
disfavoring
homosexual
conduct
but
merely
cohabiting
all
levels
of
state
government
from
bestowing
special
protection
upon
homosexual
conduct.
the
court’s
opinion
contains
grim
disapproving
hints
that
coloradans
have
been
guilty
of
animus
or
“animosity”
toward
homosexuality
as
though
that
has
been
established
as
on
america.
of
course
it
is
our
moral
heritage
that
one
should
not
hate
any
human
being
or
class
of
human
beings
but
i
have
thought
that
one
could
consider
certain
conduct
reprehensible,
murder
for
example
or
polygamy
or
even
cruelty
to
animals
and
could
even
exhibit
animus
towards
such
conduct.
surely
that
is
the
only
sort
of
animus
at
issue
here,
moral
disapproval
of
homosexual
conduct
the
same
sort
of
moral
disapproval
that
produce
the
century’s
old
laws
that
we
held
constitutional
in
bowers.
but
though
coloradans
are
as
i
say
entitled
to
be
hostile
towards
homosexual
conduct.
the
fact
is
that
the
degree
of
hostility
reflected
by
amendment
2
is
the
smallest
degree
conceivable.
the
court’s
portrayal
of
coloradans
as
a
society
fallen
victim
to
pointless
hate-filled
gay-bashing
is
entirely
false.
colorado
not
only
is
one
of
the
25
states
that
have
repealed
their
antisodomy
laws
but
it
was
among
the
first
to
do
so.
but
the
society
that
eliminates
criminal
punishment
for
homosexual
acts
does
not
necessarily
abandon
the
view
that
homosexuality
is
morally
wrong
and
socially
harmful.
often
evolution
simply
reflects
the
view
that
enforcement
of
such
criminal
laws
involves
unseemly
intrusion
into
the
intimate
lives
of
citizens.
nonetheless,
by
the
time
coloradans
who
are
asked
to
vote
on
amendment
2,
three
colorado
cities,
aspen,
boulder,
and
denver
had
enacted
ordinances
that
listed
sexual
orientation
as
an
impermissible
ground
for
discrimination
equating
the
moral
disapproval
of
homosexual
conduct
with
racial
or
religious
bigotry.
the
phenomenon
had
even
appeared
state
wide.
the
governor
of
colorado
had
signed
an
executive
order
directing
all
state
agency
heads
to
"ensure
nondiscrimination
in
hiring
and
promotion
based
on
among
other
things
sexual
orientation."
i
do
not
mean
to
be
critical
of
this
legislative
successes,
homosexuals
are
as
entitled
to
use
the
legal
system
for
reinforcement
of
their
moral
sentiments
as
is
the
rest
of
society,
but
they
are
subject
to
be
encountered
by
lawful
democratic
countermeasures
as
well
and
that
is
where
amendment
2
came
in.
it
sought
to
counter
both
the
geographic
concentration
and
the
disproportionate
single
issue
voting
power
of
homosexuals
by
(1)
resolving
the
controversy
at
the
state
wide
level
and
(2)
making
the
election
a
single
issue
contest
for
both
sides.
it
put
directly
to
all
the
citizens
of
the
state
the
question
should
homosexuality
be
given
special
protection.
they
answered
no.
the
court
today
asserts
that
this
most
democratic
of
procedure
is
unconstitutional.
lacking
any
cases
to
establish
that
proposition,
the
court
simply
asserts
that
is
must
be
unconstitutional
because
it
has
never
happened
before.
it
is
not
the
court
says
within
our
constitutional
traditional
to
enact
the
laws
as
of
this
sort.
as
i
have
noted,
this
is
proved
false
every
time
a
state
law
prohibiting
or
disfavoring
certain
conducts
is
passed
because
such
a
law
prevents
the
adversely
affected
group
whether
drug
addict
or
smokers
or
gun
owners
or
motorcyclists
from
changing
the
policy
thus
established
in
each
of
the
sub
units
of
the
state.
but
there
is
no
much
closer
analogy
one
that
involves
precisely
the
effort
by
the
majority
of
citizens
to
preserve
its
view
of
sexual
morality
state
wide
against
the
efforts
of
a
geographically
concentrated
and
politically
powerful
minority
to
undermine
it.
the
constitutions
of
the
states
of
arizona,
idaho,
new
mexico,
oklahoma,
and
utah,
to
this
date
contain
provisions
stating
that
polygamy
is
“forever
prohibited.”
polygamists
and
those
who
have
a
polygamous
orientation
have
been
singled
out
by
these
provisions
for
much
more
severe
treatment
than
merely
denial
of
favored
status
which
is
what
at
issue
here,
and
that
treatment
can
only
be
changed
by
achieving
amendment
of
the
state
constitution.
the
court’s
disposition
today
suggest
that
these
provisions
are
unconstitutional
and
that
polygamy
must
be
permitted
in
these
states
on
a
state
legislated
or
perhaps
even
local
option
basis
unless
of
course
polygamists
for
some
reason
have
fewer
constitutional
rights
than
homosexuals.
the
united
states
congress
by
the
way
required
the
inclusion
of
this
anti-polygamy
provision
in
the
constitutions
of
arizona,
idaho,
new
mexico,
oklahoma,
and
utah,
as
a
condition
of
their
admission
to
the
union.
the
court’s
stern
disapproval
of
animosity
towards
homosexuality
might
be
compared
with
what
an
earlier
court
said
in
one
of
the
cases
involving
those
anti-polygamy
laws,
murphy
versus
ramsey,
rejecting
a
constitutional
challenge
to
united
states
statute
that
denied
the
franchise
in
federal
territories
to
those
who
engaged
in
polygamous
cohabitation.
the
court
wrote,
"certainly
no
legislation
can
be
supposed
more
wholesome
and
necessary
in
the
founding
of
a
free
self
governing
commonwealth
fit
to
take
rank
as
one
of
the
coordinate
states
of
the
union,
than
that
whcih
seeks
to
establish
it
on
the
basis
of
the
idea
of
the
family,
as
consisting
in
and
springing
from
the
union
for
life
of
one
man
and
one
woman
in
the
holy
estate
of
matrimony;
the
sure
foundation
of
all
that
is
stable
and
noble
in
our
civilization,
the
best
guarantee
of
that
reverent
morality
which
is
the
source
of
all
beneficent
progress
in
social
and
political
improvement."
i
would
not
myself
engage
in
such
official
praise
for
heterosexual
monogamy
because
it
think
it
no
business
of
the
courts
as
suppose
to
the
political
branches
to
take
sides
in
this
culture
war.
but
the
court
today
has
done
so
not
only
by
inventing
a
novel
and
extravagant
constitutional
doctrine
to
take
the
victory
away
from
traditional
forces
but
even
by
verbally
disparaging
as
bigotry
adherence
to
traditional
latitude.
i
vigorously
dissent.
my
dissent
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas.
