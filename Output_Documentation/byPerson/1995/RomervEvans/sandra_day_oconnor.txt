well,
mr.
tymkovich,
the
language
of
the
amendment
i
guess
has
never
been
actually
interpreted
by
the
colorado
courts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
it
been
construed
or
interpreted
as
yet,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
it
mean
that
homosexuals
are
not
covered
by
colorado's
laws
of
general
applicability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
the
literal
language
would
indicate
that,
for
example,
a
public
library
could
refuse
to
allow
books
to
be
borrowed
by
homosexuals
and
there
would
be
no
relief
from
that,
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
displace
courts
in
colorado?
can
a
court
hear
a
1983
case
in
colorado--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--dealing
with
discrimination--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
there's
a
homosexual
plaintiff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
i
don't
read
anything
in
the
opinion
that
tells
me
what
the
thing
means.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
really
don't
have
a
definitive
interpretation,
i
guess,
of
how
far
this
amendment
would
go.
i
think
the
arguments
and
responses
this
morning
are
illustrative
of
the
fact
that
we're
not
sure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
looked
at
that,
and
i
just
thought
that
that
wasn't
definitive.
there
are
still
questions
about
how
far
it
would
go
and
the
extent
to
which
it
reaches
courts,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
dubofsky,
could
colorado
adopt
a
law
that
says
any
law
in
our
state
dealing
with
discrimination
on
any
ground
has
to
be
passed
at
the
state
level?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
be
valid.
