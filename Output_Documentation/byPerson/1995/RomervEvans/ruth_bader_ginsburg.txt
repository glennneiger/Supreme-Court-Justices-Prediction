justice

bader

mr.
tymkovich,
even
focusing
on
state
law
alone,
federal
law
is
of
course
supreme.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
james
v.
valtierra
dealt
with
one
issue,
low
cost
housing.
there
were
dozens
of
other
ways
in
which
to
improve
the
status
of
the
poor,
to
fight
against
the
blight
of
poverty.
but
here,
it's
everything...
thou
shalt
not
have
access
to
the
ordinary
legislative
process
for
anything
that
will
improve
the
condition
of
this
particular
group...
and
i
would
like
to
know
whether
in
all
of
u.s.
history
there
has
been
any
legislation
like
this
that
earmarks
a
group
and
says,
you
will
not
be
able
to
appeal
to
your
state
legislature
to
improve
your
status.
you
will
need
a
constitutional
change
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--colorado
has
no
law
that
prohibits
consensual
homosexual
conduct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
said
the
ban
extends
to
state
legislation
as
well
as
to
local
legislation
here.
it's
not
a
question
of
who
can
do
it,
but
the
state
itself
can't
do
it
through
the
ordinary
legislative
process.
it
will
take
a
constitutional
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tymkovich,
i
was
trying
to
think
of
something
comparable
to
this,
and
what
occurred
to
me
is
that
this
political
means
of
going
at
the
local
level
first
is
familiar
in
american
politics.
in
fact,
it
was
the
way
that
the
suffragists
worked.
when
they
were
unable
to
achieve
the
vote
statewide,
they
did
it
on
a
cities
first
approach,
and
i
take
it
from
what
you
are
arguing
that
if
there
had
been
a
referendum
that
said
no
local
ordinance
can
give
women
the
vote,
that
that
would
have
been
constitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
would
have
happened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
right
to
vote
for
women.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
they
weren't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
it
would
have
been
constitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
that's
what
you're
urging
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
just
said
that
in...
apart
from
whatever
the
common
law
might
be,
with
this
ordinance
on...
with
this
amendment
on
the
books,
a
restaurant
owner
can
say,
sorry,
i
don't
want
to
serve
gay
people,
and
what
about...
take
a
scarce
resource.
think
of
a
public
hospital
that
has
a
kidney
dialysis
machine,
and
the
hospital
says,
we
have
to
limit
this,
and
one
group
that
we're
going
to
keep
out,
we're
not
going
to
have
any
gay,
any
lesbian
person
use
this...
use
this
facility.
now,
there
would
be,
under
this
amendment,
what
recourse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's
just
have
the
law
as
it
is
right
now.
there's
a
scarce
resource.
there's
a
basis...
there
has
to
be
some
rules
about
who
can
use
it
and
who
can't.
that's
the
rule
that
the
public
hospital
sets.
under
this
amendment,
that's
okay,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
the
very
purpose
of
this
ordinance
to
say,
it's
not
arbitrary
to
leave
out
of
a
catalog
of
protection
against
discrimination,
it's
not
arbitrary
to
leave
out
homosexual,
lesbian...
persons
of
homosexual,
lesbian,
or
bisexual
orientation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
dubofsky,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
what
you're
saying
about
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
said,
at
a
minimum
this
amendment
immediately
repeals
all
of
the
laws
that
are
listed,
and
this
group
of
people
cannot
be
reinstated
into
this
group
of
laws
without
a
constitutional
amendment,
and
that
is
what
you
say
is
unconstitutional--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--under
federal
equal
protection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
both
words
are
used...
both
words
are
used
in
the
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
dubofsky,
if
we
could
go
back
to
the
question
justice
kennedy
was
asking,
i
take
it
your
answer
to
him
was,
your
objection
is
to
the
permanency,
the
bar
to
access
to
the
political
process
to
get
something
changed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
objecting
to
the
state
saying,
we
repeal
all
existing
ordinances.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
do
you
answer
justice
kennedy's
further
question,
well,
isn't
the
state
entitled
to
end
a
ping
pong
game?
the
locality
passes
it,
the
state
repeals
it.
the
locality
passes
it
again,
the
state
repeals
it
again.
