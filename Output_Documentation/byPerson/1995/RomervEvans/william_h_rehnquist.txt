we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94
1039,
roy
romer
v.
richard
g.
evans.
mr.
tymkovich.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tymkovich,
what
is
now
required
under
colorado
law,
assuming
that
the
constitutionality
of
this
is
upheld,
in
order
to
change
that
provision?
it
would
be
what,
a
statewide
referendum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
state
of
virginia
has
a
very
broad
state
preemption
doctrine.
local
governments
do
not
have
the
power
in
virginia
that
they
do
in
many
other
places.
i
suppose
the
rational
basis
for
that
is
just
that
the
people
generally
would
prefer
to
have
the
rules
set
by
the
state
at
large
rather
than
by
local
governments.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
tymkovich.
ms.
dubofsky,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
all
levels
of
government
in
colorado,
ms.
dubofsky,
you
don't
include
the
people
by
referendum,
i
take
it,
or
the
people
by
initiative.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
the
white
appendix,
or
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--d
as
in
does?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
david,
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
your
position,
ms.
dubofsky,
that
you
can
sustain
the
colorado
supreme
court's
decision
overthrowing
the
statute
by
taking
just
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
was
the
minimum
meaning?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
you
don't
have
to
get
beyond
that,
in
your
view,
in
order
to
uphold
your
position.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
dubofsky,
supposing
that
in
colorado,
shortly
before
the
enactment
of
this
ordinance,
there
had
been
agitation,
say,
by
dissident
mormon
sects
to
repeal
the
prohibition
against
polygamy
that
i
assume
colorado
has,
and
so
there's
a
referendum
that
says...
the
colorado
constitution
says
polygamy
will
always
be
a
felony
in
the
state
of
colorado,
now,
does
that
fence
out
these
people
who
would
like
to
see
polygamy
allowed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there...
well,
there...
it's
certainly
restructured,
if
they
were
agitating
before
the
legislature
to
try
to
get
a
prohibition
against
polygamy
repealed.
it
certainly
fences
them
out
there.
they
now
have
to
go
to
a
referendum
just
like
your
clients
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
a
problem
would
you
have?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
then
you
say
that
colorado
cannot
say
in
its
constitution
either
polygamy
or
bigamy
will
always
be
a
felony.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
it
be
valid,
under
your
theory
of
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
why
is
that
different
from
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
surely
the
dissident
sects
that
want
to
practice
polygamy
are
a
particular
group
of
people,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
maybe
this
is
essential
to
their
religion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
ms.
dubofsky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tymkovich,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
tymkovich.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94-1039,
romer
against
evans
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
