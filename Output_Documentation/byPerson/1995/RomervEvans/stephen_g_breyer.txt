justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
i
do
have
one
question
on
that
point
which
i'd
like
to
ask.
the
statute
says,
no
agency
shall
adopt
or
enforce
any
policy
whereby
homosexual
conduct,
or
whatever,
orientation,
shall
be
the
basis
of
any
claim
of
discrimination.
so
if
a
police
department
says,
there's
been
a
lot
of
gay
bashing.
it's
our
policy.
stop
it.
if
the
head
librarian
says,
you're
making
gays
sit...
you're
being
mean
to
them
and
not
letting
them
in.
if
the
health
department
says
the
same
thing,
if
the
insurance
commissioner
says
the
same
thing,
doesn't
this
word
policy
cover
that,
and
if
it
doesn't
cover
it,
what
is
it
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
what
they
say
is,
they
put
up
regulation
14.2.
there's
been
gay
bashing
here.
stop
it.
they
put
it
more
politely,
but
that's
what
they
mean.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
not
prohibit
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
does
the
word
policy
prohibit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
give
me
an
example.
what
could
it
possibly
be?
what
is
policy,
if
it
isn't
the
policy
of
the
department
saying,
do
not
discriminate
against
gays?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
[laughter]
but
does
it
prevent...
what...
give
me
an
example
of
what
it
prevents.
does
it
prevent
the
police
department,
the
librarian,
the
dozens
of
state
agencies
from
putting
up
a
piece
of
paper
that
says,
policy
it
is
our
policy
in
this
department
not
to
discriminate
against
gays.
you're
saying
it
doesn't
prohibit
that.
then
what
does
it
prohibit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
look,
suppose
boulder,
colorado
says,
it
is
our
policy
in
boulder
not
to
discriminate
against
gays.
they
call
it
boulder
regulation
14.2.
is
that
forbidden
by
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
suppose
the
police
department
does
exactly
the
same
thing.
is
that
forbidden
by
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
police
department--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
understand.
so
is
the
city
of
colorado.
they're
all
governed
by,
they
can't
discriminate
arbitrarily.
my
point
is,
suppose
that
the
police
department
says
exactly
the
same
thing.
you
say
that's
not
forbidden.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
we
do
about,
counsel
for
the
other
side
said,
no,
it
doesn't
forbid
the
police
department
from
having
a
rule
saying
don't
discriminate
against
gays.
it
doesn't
forbid
any
of
these
agencies
from
having
such
a
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
d
24
and
d
25
there's
some
particular
examples.
wasn't
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--colleges,
state
colleges,
the
insurance
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
a
state
college...
can
a
state
university
decide
not
to
admit
a
student
under
generally
applicable
law
because
it
doesn't
like
the
way
he
combs
his
hair?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
can
state
universities
discriminate
arbitrarily?
can
state
insurance
commissioners
discriminate
arbitrarily?
i
would
assume
not.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
principle
in
colorado
law,
as
in
many
laws...
let
me
explain
what
i'm
thinking...
simply
that
if
a
private
person
can
often
act
arbitrarily,
often,
and
you
tell
that
person
that
they
can't
discriminate
against
gays,
you've
given
gays
a
special
protection,
all
right,
but
governments
by
and
large
cannot
act
arbitrarily
anyway.
is
there
such
a
principle
in
colorado
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
an
administrative
procedures
act,
for
example,
in
colorado?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
why
you
say,
or
you
think
the
colorado
supreme
court
is
saying
that
this
law
or
policy,
if
it
means
anything,
means
that
colorado
cannot
enforce
that
nonarbitrary
principle
anyway
through
rules
and
regulations.
