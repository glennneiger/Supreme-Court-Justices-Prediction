mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
the
authority
of
a
state
to
allocate
certain
law
making
power
among
its
state
and
local
governments.
colorado's
amendment
2
reserves
to
the
state
the
decision
of
whether
to
extend
special
protections
under
state
law
on
the
basis
of
homosexual
or
bisexual
conduct
or
orientation.
the
sole
question
here
is
whether
in
this
facial
challenge
that
statewide
reservation
of
authority
should
be
nullified
under
this
court's
prior
holdings
in
james
v.
valtierra
and
hunter
v.
erickson.
that
question
can
be
authoritatively
resolved
for
two
core
reasons.
first,
the
logic
and
holding
of
james
is
indistinguishable
and
controls
here.
secondly,
the
rationality
of
the
substantive
policy
judgment
that
has
so
far
motivated
congress
and
other
states
in
deciding
not
to
extend
title
vii
protections
or
other...
to
homosexuals
and
bisexuals
similarly
supports
the
decision
of
colorado
to
reserve
that
question
to
itself
on
a
statewide
basis.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
your
honor,
in
james
v.
valtierra
the
court
was
presented
with
a
question
involving
a
state
constitutional
amendment
that
also
identified
a
classification...
in
that
case,
low
income
persons...
and
in
analyzing
the
question
there,
the
court
fundamentally
looked
at
whether
hunter
v.
erickson
should
extend
beyond
the
specific
racial
context
in
which
it
was
decided.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
the
classification
in
james
did
involve
a
reference
to
a
specific
subset
of
persons,
an
identifiable
group
under
the
theory
of
the
colorado
supreme
court.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
your
honor,
the
objective
here
was
to
resolve
an
issue
of
whether
or
not
to
extend
special
protections
to
homosexuals
and
bisexuals,
so
the
issue
resolved
here--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--the
colorado--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--your
honor,
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
and
the
provision
was
enjoined
before
it
ever
went
into
effect.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
for
bases
of
this
appeal,
the
colorado
court
did
make
an
interpretation
that
at
least
to
the
extent
that
it
preempted
local
laws
and
state
provisions,
that's
all
the
farther
it
went.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
no,
it
does
not.
in
the--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--there
are
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
in
the
second
opinion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
what
i'll
call
evans
2,
the
colorado
supreme
court
did,
in
footnote
9
of
that
opinion,
make
reference
to
some
general
laws
of
general
applicability
and
found
that
those
would
not
be
displaced
by
amendment
2.
secondly,
the--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--absolutely.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
yes,
it
may.
there--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--it
absolutely
changes
no
provisions
under
federal
law
in
access
to
the
court
or
vindication
of
one's
equal
protection
rights,
nor
does
it
affect
the
state--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--the
construction
that
we
have
offered
is
well
supported
by
the
legislative
history
and
the
intent
of
the
proponents.
we
think
that
the
law
clearly
on
its
face
refers
to
state
enactments
and
state
policies
and
does
not
displace
any
federal
law
or
policy.
the
ballot
analysis
which
we
presented
in
our
appendix
to
the
petition
makes
it
clear
that
this
was
not
intended
to
extend
beyond
state
and
local
laws,
so
it's
our
view
that
under
the
supremacy
clause
as
well
as
under
a
plain
interpretation
of
the
amendment,
that
federal
law
would
not
be
disrupted.
moreover--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--yes.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
your
honor,
it's
not
unprecedented
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
preemptive
law.
it
is
unusual
to
the
extent
that
two
strands
of
the
law
come
together,
but
the
court's
cases
have
made
it
clear
that
it's
appropriate
to
withdraw
authority
over
certain
issues
from
a
local
level
to
a
higher
level
of
state
government.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
it's
unclear
from
this
text.
however,
the
reason
that
that
language
is
in
amendment
2
is
because
this
was
a
plain
response
to
certain
laws
that
had
been
enacted
by
state
and
local
government
that
used
the
term
bisexual,
but
it
could
include
either
conduct
or
orientation.
again,
it's
unclear
how
you
determine--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--that's
right,
the--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--no.
colorado
repealed
its
sodomy
law
in
1972,
but
to
answer--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--justice
scalia's
question,
it
is
unclear
whether
conduct
defines
the
class.
many
courts
have
so
held
in
looking
at
the
issue
of
a
classification
involving--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--yes.
we
believe
that
conduct
is
the
best
indicator
of--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--no,
your
honor,
because
that
was
immaterial
to
the
litigation
below.
there
was
an
attempt
by
the
respondents
to
prove
a
suspect
class--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--i
don't
think
that
there's
a
serious
question
that--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--i
think
that
that
doesn't
change
the
legal
position
of
the
state
with
respect
to
this
classification.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
your
honor,
there
is
a
classification
involved,
but
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination.
all
the
fact
that
the
law--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--i
think
it
means
an
arbitrary
or
irrational
classification,
and
that
is
not
the
case
here.
i
think
we've
shown
that
there
are
reasons
for
the
classification.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
i
think
it's
an
equal
protection
problem,
but
the
question
is,
does
it
impinge
on
a
suspect
class
here--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--or
has
there
been
some
type
of
fundamental--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--no,
your
honor,
because
of
the
way
the
lower
court
has--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--has
characterized
the
fundamental
right
here.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
think--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--there's
been
no
due
process
challenge
in
this
case--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--and
there
is--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--that's
correct.
there
is
a
slippery--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--well,
the
initiative
is
the
ordinary
political
process
in
our
state.
we've
had
many
repeals
in
other
substantive
matters
on
our
statewide
ballot.
we
had
four
on
the...
four
repeal
measures
on
the
ballot
the
same
year
that
amendment
2
was
enacted.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--classification
would
be
analyzed
under
this
court's
equal
protection
jurisprudence
on
a
suspect--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--i
think
the
court
would
apply
the
traditional
equal
protection
analysis
and--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--they
would
have
determined
whether
or
not
there
was
a
fundamental
right
to
vote
that
had
been
impinged
on
or
was--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--right,
or
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
or
whether
women
were
a
suspect
class
entitled
to
some
heightened
scrutiny
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
if
they
weren't,
the
court
would--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--enact
a
rational
basis
type
of
review.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
yes.
we're
urging
for
this
classification,
that
the
court
engage
in
a
rational
basis
type
of
review.
no
court
has
found
homosexual
orientation
or
conduct
to
be
a
suspect
classification.
therefore,
the
traditional
equal
protection
model
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
would
be
an
initiative,
or
a
referred
measure
from
our
state
legislature,
and
it
would
be
placed
on
the
ballot
in
the
same
fashion
that
the
amendment
2
was
placed
on
the
ballot
in
the
first
instance,
so
there
would
be
that
mere
opportunity
for
the
opponents
of
amendment
2,
just
like
there
were
for
the
proponents.
and
to
further
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question,
what
the
respondents
here
are
saying
is
that
those
who
oppose
certain
type
of
special
protections
here
cannot
get
their
policy
preference
vindicated
through
the
legislative
process
unless
they
are
able
to
successfully
preempt
or
repeal
such
laws
at
the
local
level.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
protected
status
would
be
a
particular
affirmative
positive
piece
of
legislation
that
granted
some
type
of
protection--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--beyond
the
fourteenth
amendment
baseline.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
that's
right.
amendment
2
is
simply
a
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--to
the
extent
there
was
some
tort
law
of
general
applicability
in
those
circumstances
about
innkeeper's
duty,
we
don't
think
that
amendment
2
would
knock
that
out.
to
the
extent--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--amendment
2
would
carve
out
any
special
protections
in
the
public
accommodation
area
that
had
been
extended
to
homosexuals--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--a
homosexual
would
not
have
any
claim
of
discrimination
or
special
liability
theory
in
a
private
setting
after
amendment
2.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
unless
the
court...
and
again,
we
haven't
had
a
full
construction
of
amendment
2
yet
from
our
state
courts.
unless
a
state
court
construed
the
innkeeper's
duty
to
be
a
law
of
general
applicability
to--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--i
do
not.
i
have
not
encountered
that,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
that
will
be
a
question
for
the
state
courts
interpreting
amendment
2.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
i
think
it
would
be
treated
just
like
any
other
characteristic
or
classification
that
has
not
gotten
the
special
benefits
of
the
civil
rights
law.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
unless--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--that
would
bring
it
into
the
range
of
private
choice
and
private
arrangements,
unless
there
is
some
particular
law
that
would
disable
that
ability
by
private--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--unless
amendment
2
is
repealed,
or
there
is
some
general
provision
that
might
apply.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
preempt
state
and
local
laws
that
extended
special
protections.
it
was
a
response
to
political
activism
by
a
political
group
that
wanted
to
seek
special
affirmative
protections
under
the
law.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
amendment
2
covers
a
range
of
circumstances,
not
just
the
preemption
of
the
local
ordinances,
but
it
did
do
that.
it
also
served
as
a--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--the
rationale
is
any
law
of
general
preemption
that
wants
to
make
a
substantive
decision,
and
the
people
here,
the
rational
basis
for
that
substantive
decision
in
our
view
was
a
political
response
to
what
the
people
might
have
perceived
as
laws
going
too
far
or
being
too
intrusive.
what
this
does
is--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
there's
nothing
wrong,
especially
in
this
area
of
civil
rights
and
statewide
protections,
in
making
that
an
issue
of
statewide
concern,
and
that's
simply
what
colorado
was--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--your
honor,
that's
a
quintessential
political
judgment
on
how
you
provide
relative
protection
to
relative
groups.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
your
honor,
that's
not
my
response.
i
think
there
are
some
particular
discrete
reasons
also,
and
this
is
to
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question
also.
this
issue
was
seen
as
particularly
desirable
for
a
statewide
uniform
determination.
there's
a
question
about
the
desirability
of
each
local
jurisdiction
dealing
with
this
issue,
which
i
think
raises
some
very
fundamental
and
sensitive
cultural,
moral,
political
concerns
for
our
state.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
your
honor,
in
addition
to
statewide
uniformity,
we've
also
advanced
some
reasons
that
show
how
amendment
2
advances
other
liberty
interests,
and
there
are
competing
liberty
interests
that
are,
in
fact--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--it
promotes
a
zone
of
autonomy.
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
trial
court
found
that
religious
liberty
interests
were
advanced
here,
associational
liberties
were
advanced
here,
and
the
court
simply
made
a
determination
below
that
they
were
not
narrowly
tailored,
so--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--that's
exactly
what
happened
here,
and
the
court--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--i
think
the
problem
that
the
voters
saw,
they
were
presented
with
an
opportunity
to
preempt
and
make
a
decision
at
a
statewide
level
for
laws
that
raise
particular
and
sensitive
liberty
concerns.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
that's
right.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
it
is,
and
this
is
an
area
where
there
have
been
piecemeal
additions
of
special
protections.
we've
had--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--i
think
it
creates
a
cause
of
action
on
the
basis
of
the
characteristic
that's
not
available
to
the
general
population
at
large.
homosexuals
are
entitled
to
every
other
protection
of
the
civil
rights
laws,
the
criminal
laws,
the--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--well,
first
of
all
there's
federal
law
that
may
preempt,
and
secondly,
there
is
an
opportunity,
as
we
construe
amendment
2,
for
the
state
to
enact
a
policy
that
would
treat
all
citizens
the
same
in
those
circumstances
rather
than
carve
out
a
special--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--in
this
facial
challenge,
we
don't
know
how
the
court
is
going
to
construe
other
potentially
applicable
state
laws.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
the
government
agencies
that
you've
indicated
could
enact
a
general
nonbias
policy
or
require--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--amendment
2
would
not
prohibit
that.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
it
would
not
prohibit--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--policy
prohibits
the
enactment
of
some
special
entitlement--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--no.
the
criminal
law
is--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--yes,
and
amendment
2
does
nothing
to
restrict
the
applicable--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--that's
right.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
it
prohibits
any
type
of
special
protection
or
a
liability
claim
that
somebody
might
have
under
that
policy.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
the
health--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--the
health...
that
regulation
did
carve
out
what
would
be
construed
as
special
protection--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
thought
he
was
talking
about
a
law
of
general
applica--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--yes,
it
would
to
the
extent--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--the
police
department
would
be
governed
by
a
rule
of
general
applica--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--they
would
not
be
able
to--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
your
honor,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
your
honor,
the
colorado
supreme
court
rule
basically
holds
that
preemption
is
unconstitutional.
it
says
that
with
respect
to
this
issue...
this
issue,
not
the
people.
this
issue...
it
must
be
resolved
at
the
local
level,
and
that
people
who
oppose
the
substantive
policy--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--it's
preemption
of
this
issue
that
affects
a
group,
and
in
james
the
court
told
us
it's
permissible--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--it's
an
issue
that
affects
a
group,
like
in
james,
and
like
in
gregory
v.
ashcroft,
where
we
had
an
age
restriction
in
the
state.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
right,
and
then
there
would
be
the
question--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--of
whether
a
rational
basis
supports
that.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
in
this
case--
