ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
let
me
begin
with
how
amendment
2
should
be
construed
and
then
discuss
how
our
legal
theories
relate
to
its
unique
combination
of
breadth
and
selectivity.
amendment
2
is
vertically
broad
in
that
it
prohibits
all
levels
of
government
in
the
state
of
colorado
from
ever
providing
any
opportunity
for
one
to
seek
protection
from
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gay
orientation.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
no,
we
do
not.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
the--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--the
state
has
conceded
that
amendment
2
is
unconstitutional
to
the
degree
it
would
prohibit
such
a
claim
based
upon
federal
law
since
1983.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
our
theory
is
that
amendment
2
on
its
face
prohibits
a
state
court
from
recognizing
such
a
claim,
but
that
particular
interpretation
of
the
amendment
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
find
that
amendment
2
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
right.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
right.
the
colorado
supreme
court
interpreted
the
amendment,
and
it
said
it
was
doing
this
as
a
minimum,
because
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
find
the
amendment
unconstitutional.
it
interpreted
the
amendment
to
mean
that
state
and
local
governments
are
barred
from
promulgating
and
enforcing
rules
that
declare
discrimination
against
gay
people
by
both
government
and
private
actors
to
be
arbitrary,
so
that
would
include
justice
breyer's
general
policy
suggestion
with
respect
to
the
police
department.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
the
colorado
supreme
court
interpretation
of
this
amendment
is
authoritative
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
i
believe,
and
the
colorado
supreme
court--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--it
says
that
on
page
b
3,
d
24--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--yes,
in
the
white
appendix.
b
3,
d
24,
and
d
25.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
d
as
in
david,
or
does,
yes.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
and
the
way
in
which
the
colorado
supreme
court
says
that
is
by
giving
examples
of
the
types
of
provisions
that
would
be
repealed
by
the
amendment,
or
precluded
from
enactment
in
the
future.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
b
as
in
boy.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes,
and
it
refers
back
to
the
first
sentence.
it
says,
the
immediate
objective
of
amendment
2
is
at
a
minimum
to
repeal
existing
statutes,
regulations,
ordinances,
and
policies.
then
on
pages--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--well--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--that's
correct.
there
are
general
laws
that
say--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--the
colorado
supreme
court
is
referring
to?
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it's
referring
to
the
general
ordinances
that
were
preempted
by
amendment
2,
and
in
colorado
those
general
ordinances
either
have
specific
exceptions
for
exactly
the
type
of
example
you
gave,
or
they
have
never
been
enforced
to
have
someone
in
the
mrs.
murphy's
boardinghouse
situation
required
to
accept
someone
who
does--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--we
think
it
can
mean
that,
but
we
don't
think
the
colorado
supreme
court
found
it
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
its
interpretation--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--and
we're
not
arguing
that
it
needs
to
be
interpreted
that
broadly
in
order
to
find
amendment
2
unconstitutional.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
i
think
we're
having
trouble
a
little
bit
with
semantics.
one
of
the
difficulties
is
the
use
of
the
words
special
protection
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
there
is
such
a
thing
as
special
rights
or
special
protections.
i
think
there's
a
right
which
everyone
has
to
be
free
from
arbitrary
discrimination.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
right,
d
24--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--that's
right.
that's
right,
and
all
of
those
particular
laws
say
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation.
they
apply
to
everyone.
they're
laws
of
general
applicability.
amendment
2
preempts
those
laws,
or
precludes
or
bars
those
laws
only
on
the
basis
that
they
provide
protection
for
people
on
the
basis
of
gay
sexual
orientation.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
well,
in
colorado--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--in
colorado,
there
is
a
law
which
says
one
cannot
be
terminated
from
employment
for
any
legal
off
duty
conduct,
and
gives
one
the
basis
for
a
claim.
if
your
employer
doesn't
like
the
way
you
comb
your
hair,
that
was
an
improper
reason
for
terminating
your
employment.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
a
question
i'm
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to,
but
i
think--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--i
don't
think
they
can
discriminate
arbitrarily,
no.
they
shouldn't
be
able
to.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
i
think
a
court
could
find
that,
yes.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
well,
it
depends
upon
whether
the
court
is
referring
to
more
general
equal
protection
law
on
a
federal
level.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
if
that
criteria
in
the
particular
case
is
because
the
person
who
was
denied
that
benefit
is
a
gay
person,
then
i
think
under
amendment
2
the
court
would
not
be
able
to
provide
relief.
now,
we
don't
think
that
this
court
needs
to
resolve
that
type
of
a
specific
issue,
the
application
of
amendment
2,
in
order
to
find
amendment
2
unconstitutional.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
amendment
2
if
interpreted
at
its
broadest
would
authorize
that
type
of
discrimination.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes,
it
would
be,
i
believe--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--and
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
amendment
2
would
prevent
a
court
from
providing
a
remedy
in
these
circumstances.
we
think
it
does
on
its
face.
however,
the
colorado
supreme
court--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--absolutely.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
but
the
colorado
supreme
court
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
order
to
find
the
amendment
unconstitutional.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
i
think
we
do
have
a
definitive
interpretation
from
the
colorado
supreme
court.
it's
at
pages
d
25
and
d
24,
actually--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--and
that's
where
the
court--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--one
of
the
difficulties
with
this
amendment
is
that
you
have
no
idea
what
type
of
general
rule
might
be
necessary
in
the
future
to
prevent
arbitrary
discrimination
against
gay
people.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
and
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
that's
right.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
well,
we
would
here
because
we
think
the
minimal
interpretation
here
is
sufficient
to
find
the
amendment
unconstitutional.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
there
are
no
applications
that
would
be
constitutional.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
it
just
means
that
those
are
irrelevant.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
we're
saying
that
the
minimal
interpretation
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
gave
to
this
in
all
of
its
applications
is
invalid.
because
there
may
be
other
types
of
applications
of
this
amendment,
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
those
in
this
particular
facial
challenge
because
they're
basically
irrelevant.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
or--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--or
any
other
laws
of
general
prophylactic
rules.
there's
a
difference
between
general
prophylactic
rules
that
prevent
arbitrary
discrimination
such
as
the
rules
or
statutes
that
are
listed
there,
but
that's
not
an
exhaustive
list,
and
the
application
or,
you
know,
case
by
case
determination
of
whether
a
particular
denial
of
admission
to
a
hotel,
let's
say,
is
covered
by
amendment
2.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
no,
they...
it's
not
homosexual
orientation,
it's
sexual
orientation
in
general.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
the
laws
that
amendment
2
deals
with,
all
are
laws
that
apply
to
everyone.
amendment
2
only--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--that
could
be
right.
it
depends
upon
the
circumstance.
but
what
i'm
really
trying
to
point
out
is
that
rules
such
as
general...
the
boulder
ordinance,
let's
say,
or
the
state
insurance
statute,
presume
that
certain
types
of
discrimination
can
be
arbitrary.
they're
general
prophylactic
rules.
most
of
our
civil
rights
laws
in
this
country
are
effectively
enforced
by
general
prophylactic
rules.
if
we
had
to
rely
on
an
individual
case
by
case
enforcement,
i
don't
think
we'd
have
very
much
civil
rights
law
enforcement.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes,
there
is.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes.
there's
generally
a
principle
that
government
cannot
act
in
an
arbitrary
fashion,
that
governmental
services
are
available
to
everyone.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes,
they
could
repeal
that
ordinance.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
i
think
that's
correct.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
where
it
gets
more
difficult.
that's
where
our
political
participation
argument
comes
to
play,
that
by
disabling
a
government
from
responding
to
a
need
for
a
particular
benefit,
the
type
of
protection
that...
it
depends
upon
the
circumstances.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
it
could.
the
problem--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--well,
it
may
be.
there
are
other
problems
with
dealing
with
civil
rights
protections
and
generally,
but
let's
say
they
passed
amendment
2
but
it
didn't
target
gay
people.
it
simply
said
that
no
one
can
obtain
any
protection
from
discrimination,
arbitrary
discrimination
for
any
reason.
that
would
not
present
the
problem
that
amendment
2
presents.
amendment
2
is
very
selective.
it
targets
only
one
group
of
people,
and
that's
where
it
encounters
equal
protection
difficulties.
the
state
may
be
able
to
rearrange
its
process
in
any
number
of
ways.
it
just
can't
do
it
in
a
way
that
prevents
one
particular
group.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes.
the
colorado
supreme
court
did
interpret
this
initiative
in
this
regard.
it
said
that
homosexual
conduct
was
subsumed
within
homosexual
orientation,
and--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
what
else.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
well,
heterosexual
people
are
not
identified
exclusively
by
heterosexual
conduct.
in
the
same
fashion,
homosexual
people
are
not
defined
exclusively
by
homosexual
conduct.
it
doesn't
mean
that
heterosexual
people
don't
have
a
heterosexual
orientation.
homosexual
people
have
a
homosexual
orientation.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes,
it
does.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
and
that's
what
the
colorado
supreme
court--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--both
words
are
used
in
the
amendment,
but
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
that
homosexual
orientation
is
broader
than
homosexual
conduct
and
that...
the
state
had
been
arguing
that,
well,
we'll
just
sever
out
the
language,
homosexual
orientation,
from
amendment
2.
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
no,
you
can't
sever
this
amendment--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--if
you
thought
there
was
a
problem
with
targeting
people
based
on
their
homosexual--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--well,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
you
mean
by
problem.
do
you
mean--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--yes.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
no,
we
don't
lose,
because
this
law's--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--this
law
is
much
broader
than
that,
and
the
minimal
interpretation
given
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
is
that
the
law
covers
homosexual
orientation
as
well
as
conduct,
and
that
they
are
not
severable.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
i'm
not
certain
i
understand
what
you're
driving
at.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
no.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
not
necessarily,
because
that's
really
dealing
with
much
more
of
a
discrete
issue.
it's
not
a
restructuring
of
the
political
process.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct,
but
the
particular
issue
involved
is
having
to
do
with
the
identity
of
the
group
of
people
who
are
engaging
in
polygamy,
and
it's
prohibiting
polygamy.
the
best
way
i
can
answer
that
question
is
to
say,
if
you
substituted
bigamists
or
polygamists
into
the
language
of
amendment
2,
then
you
would
have
a
problem,
as
we
point
out,
but
here--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--you
would
have
a
problem
of
denying
people
the
fundamental
right
to
participate
in
the
political
process.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
they
could
say
that
in
their
constitution,
yes.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
to
have
that
in
the--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--colorado
constitution?
yes,
it
would.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that
is
different
from
this
case
because
this
case
is
targeting
a
particular
group
of
people
on
a
personal
characteristic,
and--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--that's
correct.
what
they're
not
being
deprived
of
is
a
whole
category
of
laws
that
provide
them
a
benefit,
the
opportunity
to
seek
protection
from
discrimination
or
a
similar--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--well,
then
it
would
come
under
a
whole
different
way
of
analyzing
the
issue,
and
that
would
be
whether
it
deprived
them
of
a
first
amendment--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--no,
i
am
not.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
what
you've
done
is
deprived
people,
based
on
their
homosexual
orientation,
of
a
whole
opportunity
to
seek
protection
from
discrimination,
which
is
a
very
different
thing.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
no--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--if
homosexuals
were
put
into
the
language
of
amendment
2
only
in
terms
of,
those
people
who
engage
in
homosexual
conduct
shall
not
be
entitled
to
ever
seek
protection
under
the
civil
rights
laws,
we
would
say
that
is
unconstitutional.
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
you
can
criminalize
homosexual
sodomy.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct,
and
it
also
could
apply
to
people
who
aren't
gay,
but
who
may
be
perceived
to
be
gay
and
are
discriminated
against
on
that
basis.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct,
and
that's
because
the
case
law
and
the
fundamental
right
to
political
participation
says
a
simple
repealer
is
all
right.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
the
constitutional
bar,
in
effect,
to
ever
adopting
a
protection
of
any
sort,
or
an
opportunity
to
seek
protection
from
discrimination,
is
a
very
different
type
of
barrier
than
a
simple
repealer
and
reenactment,
because
it
means
that
if
the
group
is
going
to
ever
obtain
any
protection,
it
has
to
amend
the
state
constitution
first.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct,
it
could.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
right.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct,
or
any
particular
group.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
it
doesn't
matter
who
the
group
is--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--you
just
can't
do
it
this
way.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
that's
correct,
you
can
end
the
game.
if
the
state
wants
to
repeal
and
prohibit
any
civil
rights
protections
for
anybody
at
any
level
of
the
government
in
the
future,
and
do
it
for
everyone--
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
--did
the
state
file
an
answer
in
this
case?
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
yes.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
and
we
tried
the
case.
ms.
jean
e.
dubofsky
thank
you.
