justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
how
that
works
in
the
public
accommodation
area?
if
a
hotel
or
a
restaurant...
at
common
law
you
get
some
kind
of
an
innkeeper's
duty
to
take
everybody
in.
could
an
innkeeper
refuse
accommodations
to
a
homosexual
who
was
not
engaging
in
any
homosexual
conduct
but
had
admitted
that
he
had
that
type
of
tendency?
could
an
innkeeper
under...
in
colorado
just
say,
i'm
sorry,
we
don't
rent
rooms
to
people
like
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
say
the
public
accommodations
protection
is
still
available
to
homosexuals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
the
rule
be
in
colorado?
how
do
you
understand
the
law
there?
now,
would
a
homosexual
have
a
right
to
be
served
in
a
restaurant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
in
the
public
accommodation
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
what
the
law
of
colorado
is
on
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
don't
know
whether
homosexuals
have
a
right
to
be
served
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
do
have
a
right
to
be
served,
would
that
be
an
affirmative
right,
then,
as
in
the
distinction
justice
scalia
was
drawing,
or
would
that
be
just
being
treated
like
everybody
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
being...
having
the
right
not
to
be
refused
a
job
or
to
rent
on
that
ground
is
a
special
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
can't
be
such
a
particular
law
in
colorado.
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one
last
question.
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
went
farther,
because
there
were
political
groups
that
had
already...
as
i
understand
it,
aspen
had
a
protective
statute
of
some
kind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's...
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
the
people
outside
of
aspen
telling
the
people
in
aspen
they
cannot
have
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
the
people
outside
of
aspen
telling
the
people
in
aspen
they
cannot
have
this
nondiscriminatory
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
special
preference
at
stake
here?
what
is
the
special
preference
that
a
homosexual
gets?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
also
true
that
this
law
applies
to
this
class
of
people
even
if
they
abstain
from
the
prohibited
conduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
rather
elementary
question
i
should
know?
did
the
state
file
an
answer
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
file
an
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
couldn't
find
it--
