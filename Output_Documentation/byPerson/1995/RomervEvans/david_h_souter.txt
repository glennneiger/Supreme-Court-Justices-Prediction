justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
the
sole
indicator?
are
you
representing
to
this
court
that
colorado's
position
is
that
the
class
defining
characteristic
is
conduct
as
opposed
to
preference
or
proclivity
or
whatnot?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then
we
have
to
do
one
of
two
things.
we
have
to
assume
that
orientation
means
something
more
than
conduct,
or
if
there
were
a
serious
question,
i
suppose
we
would
have
to
send
it
back
and
ask
the
courts
of
colorado
to
tell
us,
but
is
there
a
serious
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
orientation
means
something
more
than
conduct,
and
we
have
to
assume
that
in
ruling
on
this
challenge,
don't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
one
point
that
you
have
made,
and
you've
made
it
more
than
once
about
the...
i
guess
about
the
legal
position
of
the
state.
you've
referred
to
the
issue
as
the
permissibility
of
withdrawing
subject
matter
from
political
consideration
at
a
certain
level.
you
said
it
has
been
reserved
for
a
higher
level
of
political
action.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
that
characterization.
one
of
them
has
already
been
brought
up,
and
that
is,
this
is
not
merely
a
reservation
for
this
particular
subject
to
be
dealt
with,
for
example,
by
statewide
referendum.
it
is
in
fact
a
provision
that
no
law
may
be
made
addressing,
or
addressing
for
protective
purposes
this
kind
of
discrimination.
the
second
thing
that
seems
to
me
inaccurate
about
the
characterization
you're
giving
us
is
that
this
is
not
merely
a
reservation
of
a
subject
matter.
that
is
not
the
subject
of
the
claim.
the
claim
is
that
there
is
a
discrimination
in
the
reservation
of
the
subject
matter,
or
a
discrimination
in
the
provision
for
eligibility,
or
exercise
of
legislative
power.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
you
characterize
it,
it
would
sound
like
a
due
process
challenge,
but
in
fact
it's
an
equal
protection
challenge,
because
there's
a
discrimination
involved.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
invidious
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case,
you
recognize
that
this
is
not
the
same
problem
that
might
be
raised
if
a
certain
subject
matter,
e.g.,
discrimination,
were
reserved
for
legislative
action
at
the
state
level
rather
than
local
level.
this
is
a
different
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
it's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--a
different
problem
from
a
mere
reservation
of
a
broad
spectrum
of
action
for
political
action
at
one
level
rather
than
another.
it's
a
different
problem
from
that,
is
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying
then...
maybe
this
is
what
you're
saying,
that
if
the
equal
protection
challenge
is
in
fact
recognized
or
vindicated
here,
that
there
is
no
way
to
prevent
this
from
in
effect
ballooning
into
a
due
process
challenge,
that
if
they
win
this,
then
a
different
kind
of
claim
will
also
succeed,
i.e.,
a
claim
that
a
certain
subject
matter,
discrimination
or
not,
must
be
dealt
with
for
purposes
of
federal
law
at
a
certain
level
of
government?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
a
slippery
slope
argument.
you're
not
saying
we
go
from...
if
an
equal
protection
challenge
wins
here,
a
due
process
challenge
necessarily
wins
too.
you're
not
saying
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
what
you're
arguing.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
what
you're
arguing,
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
tymkovich,
doesn't
that
go
back
to
the
problem
i
tried
to
raise
earlier?
you're
saying
that
as
a
general
matter
certain
laws
can
be
determined
as
subject
to
action
at
one
political
level
and
not
at
others,
but
isn't
the
question
here
is,
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
determining
that
affirmative
protection
for
homosexuals
cannot
be
dealt
with
at
a
certain
level,
whereas
affirmative
protection
for
the
aged,
for
the
handicapped,
and
so
on,
can
be?
isn't
that
what
the
rational
basis
has
to
address,
and
how
does
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
address
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
a
judgment
that
is
made
politically,
but
that
doesn't
state
a
rational
basis.
i
mean,
if
we
were
saying...
if
we
were
asking
you
this
question,
why
should
discrimination
be
dealt
with
in
colorado
at
the
state
level
rather
than
the
local
level,
or
at
the
constitutional
level,
or
whatnot,
is
that
a
denial
of
any
constitutional
right,
and
you
said,
no,
that's
a
political
choice.
colorado...
the
people
of
colorado
can
decide
what
level
to
deal
with
this
problem.
that
would,
it
seems
to
me,
answer
a
substantive
due
process
challenge,
but
that's
not
the
question
that's
being
asked
here.
the
question
that's
being
asked
here
is,
why
is
discrimination
against
one
group
dealt
with
under
state
law
differently
from
discrimination
against
other
groups,
and
your
rational
basis
answer,
it
seems
to
me,
has
got
to
go
to
a
justification
for
the
classification.
it
isn't
enough
simply
to
say,
oh,
well,
that's
what
politics
decided.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
does,
but
are
you
getting
any
further
than
simply
the
answer,
that's
what
they
wanted,
that's
the
result
of
the
political
process?
i
don't
see
in
your
answer
the
kind
of
justification
independent
merely
of
majority
will,
which
an
equal
protection
classification
question
calls
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
liberty
interest
that
it
advances?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
the
problem?
i
mean,
what
is
the
problem
that
you
supposedly
have
been
having?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
on
a
narrower
interpretation,
even
for
example
if
amendment
2
didn't
touch
courts,
wouldn't
it
be
very
difficult
for
the
courts
of
colorado
to
say
that
that
was
an
irrational
or
an
arbitrary
basis
for
discrimination
with
amendment
2
on
the
books,
even
if
amendment
2
was
narrowly
construed?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it
refers
to
departments
of
the
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying,
then,
that
orientation
identifies
a
group
beyond
the
identification
of...
by
reference
to
specific
homosexual
conduct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
it's
a
broader
category.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
--but
isn't
the
breadth
that
you
would
rely
on
not
that
it
covers
orientation
rather
than
just
conduct,
but
that
it
in
effect
fences
people
out
of
a
political
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
really
your
position,
is
it,
because
if
there
were
an
ordinance...
let's
say
there
were
an
ordinance
in
a
given
city
saying
there
will
be
no
discrimination
based
on
age,
handicap,
or
sexual
orientation,
and
there
were
a
political
move
in
that
city
to
repeal
the
reference
to
sexual
orientation,
that
would
be
targeted
at
homosexuals,
but
it
would
not
run
afoul
of
what
i
understand
your
position
to
be
here,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
look,
if...
you've
got
an
ordinance
in
a
city
that
says
no
discrimination
based
on
age,
handicap,
or
sexual
orientation.
there's
a
political
move
in
the
city
to
repeal
the
reference
to
sexual
orientation.
it
succeeds.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
a
violation
of
equal
protection?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
wouldn't
you
say
that
it
could
end
the
ping
pong
ball
that
way
if
it
ends
it
with
respect
to
all
protection
against
private
discrimination?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
not
be
an
equal
protection
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
you,
you
just
can't
end
the
ping
pong
ball
for
this
particular
group.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
can
end
the
game.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
excuse
me,
i
don't
see
where
it
said
preemption
was
unconstitutional,
as
distinct
from
saying,
preemption
for
one
identifiable
group
was
unconstitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't...
the
ordinance
speaks
both
in
terms
of
issue,
i.e.,
basis
for
claim,
and
group.
i
mean,
it
refers
to
both,
doesn't
it?
you
can't
have
one
without
the
other,
the
way
the
ordinance
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
isn't
in
effect
defined
in
terms
of
the
group
under
traditional
equal
protection
analysis,
which
looks
to
the
intent
of
the
enacting
body?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
