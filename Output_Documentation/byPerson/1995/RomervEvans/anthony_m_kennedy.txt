justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
tymkovich--
--it
may
be,
counsel,
that
we
have
to
reach
that
question,
but
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
predicate
or
a
preliminary
matter
that
we
ought
to
discuss
at
some
point
during
your
oral
argument.
usually
when
we
have
an
equal
protection
question
we
measure
the
objective
of
the
legislature
against
the
class
that
is
adopted,
against
the
statutory
classification.
here,
the
classification
seems
to
be
adopted
for
its
own
sake.
i've
never
seen
a
case
like
this.
is
there
any
precedent
that
you
can
cite
to
the
court
where
we've
upheld
a
law
such
as
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
whole
point
in
james
was
that
we
knew
that
it
was
low
income
housing,
and
we
could
measure
the
need,
the
importance,
the
objectives
of
the
legislature
to
control
low
cost
housing
against
the
classification
that
was
adopted.
here,
the
classification
is
just
adopted
for
its
own
sake,
with
reference
to
all
purposes
of
the
law,
so
james
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
it
adopted
a
theory
of
a
group,
but
it
was
with
reference
to
a
specific
legislative
objective...
low
cost
housing.
here,
the
classification
is
adopted
to
fence
out,
in
the
colorado
supreme
court's
words,
the
class
for
all
purposes,
and
i've
never
seen
a
statute
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
is
inconsistent
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
said.
it
said
health
insurance
discrimination
regulations
are
void.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
based
on
sexual
orientation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
inconsistent
with
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
breyer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
have
one
more
very
specific
question.
what
about
the
courts?
can
the
courts
interpret
a
statute
that
prohibits
unreasonable
denial
of
public
accommodations
to
include
gays
by
a
specific
judgment
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--deals
with
the
rights
of
gay
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no,
i
meant
state
courts
interpreting
state
public
accommodation
laws.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you,
and
that
particular
interpretation
has
not
been
given
by
the
supreme
court
of
colorado.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
has
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
suppose
there's
a
colorado
ordinance,
or
city
ordinance
which
said
you
cannot
bar
people
from
public
accommodations
for
any
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
reason.
could
a
court
in
colorado
find
that
barring...
after
this
amendment,
could
a
court
in
colorado
find
that
it
was
unreasonable
or
arbitrary
to
bar
a
person
from
public
accommodations
by
reason
of
sexual
orientation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
despite
the
provision
under
the
constitution
that
says
no
preferences
should
be
given?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
it's
talking
about
interpreting
a
statute
that
says
you
cannot
deny
for
an
arbitrary
or
unreasonable...
on
the
basis
of
an
arbitrary
unreasonable
criterion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you,
counsel,
getting
away
from
the
wording
in
the
provisions
of
this
amendment,
suppose
that
colorado
is
concerned
that
one
city
has
passed
an
ordinance
giving
preference
to
gays
in
employment
hiring,
and
for
any
number
of
reasons
the
citizens
of
colorado
do
not
want
that.
some
people
say
they
want
uniform
laws
because
it's
easier
on
employers.
could
the
citizens
of
colorado
by
referendum
repeal
that
ordinance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
without
any
constitutional
objection?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
they
also
provide
that
no
such
ordinance
shall
be
adopted
in
the
future?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
seem
a
little
odd
that
there
could
be
an
ordinance
enacted,
then
repealed
by
the
referendum,
then
the
ordinance
is
enacted
again,
then
repealed...
it
just
goes
back
and
forth.
that
seems
a
little
odd.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
romer
versus
evans.
the
central
issue
here
is
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
colorado.
it
is
known
as
amendment
2
and
it
was
adapted
after
a
state
wide
referendum
in
1992.
the
impetus
of
the
amendment
came
largely
from
ordinances
that
had
been
past
in
the
cities
of
aspen,
boulder,
and
denver
banning
discrimination
in
many
areas,
including
housing,
employment,
public
accommodations,
and
health
and
welfare
services.
the
ordinances
had
barred
discrimination
on
various
grounds
including
sexual
orientation.
a
limit
to
repeal
the
ordinances
and
forbids
their
reenactment
to
the
extent
that
they
prohibit
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
and
this
is
a
quotation
from
amendment
2,
“homosexuals,
lesbian,
or
bisexual
orientation,
conduct,
practices
or
relationships.”
the
amendment
also
prohibits
any
other
legislative
executive
or
judicial
action
at
the
state
or
local
level
to
give
specific
legal
protection
of
any
sort
the
homosexuals
or
bisexual.
after
a
series
of
state
court
proceedings,
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
found
that
amendment
2
violates
the
united
states
constitution.
we
granted
certiorari.
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
but
on
a
rationale
different
from
that
adapted
by
the
state
supreme
court.
the
state's
main
argument
in
defense
of
amendment
2
is
that
it
put
gays
and
lesbians
in
the
same
position
as
everyone
else
that
is
the
amendment
only
denies
homosexuals’
especial
rights.
we
find
this
reading
of
the
amendment
implausible
in
view
with
interpretation
by
the
state
supreme
court.
most
states
now
choose
to
countered
discrimination
by
enacting
statutes
that
identifies
certain
institutions
and
business
and
then
specify
grounds,
they
may
not
use
as
basis
for
discrimination,
but
also
did
cover
the
institutions
or
business
for
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
traits
including
age,
military
status,
marital
status,
pregnancy,
parenthood,
custody
of
the
minor
child,
political
affiliation,
physical
and
mental
disability
and
in
recent
times
sexual
orientation.
amendment
2
bars
homosexuals
from
securing
protection
against
the
injury
that
these
public
accommodation
laws
address.
it
also
nullifies
specific
protection
for
gays
in
housing
and
insurance,
health
and
welfare
services,
private
education
and
employment,
and
forbids
all
laws
or
policies
providing
specific
protection
for
gays
or
lesbians
from
discrimination
by
any
level
of
colorado's
government.
we
cannot
accept
the
view
that
amendment
2
only
deprives
homosexuals'
special
rights.
no
matter
how
local
or
discreet
the
harm
they
may
suffer,
no
matter
how
public
or
widespread
the
injury,
they
can
obtain
protection
from
the
laws
only
by
enlisting
the
citizenry
of
colorado
to
amend
the
state
constitution
or
perhaps,
on
the
state's
view,
by
trying
to
past
helpful
laws
of
general
applicability.
the
protections
that
amendment
2
denies
to
homosexuals
have
taken
for
granted
by
most
people
either
because
they
already
have
them
or
do
no
need
them.
they
have
protections
against
exclusion
from
an
almost
limitless
number
of
transactions
that
constitute
ordinary
civic
life
in
a
free
society.
we
have
held
that
if
a
law
neither
burdens
the
fundamental
right,
nor
targets
a
suspect
class.
we
will
uphold
the
legislative
classification
so
long
as
it
bears
a
rational
relationship
to
some
legitimate
end.
amendment
2
however,
fails
and
indeed
defies
this
conventional
inquiry.
first,
it
is
not
within
our
constitutional
traditional
to
enact
laws
of
this
sort.
counter
both
to
the
idea
or
the
rule
of
law
into
our
own
constitution's
guarantee
of
equal
protection
is
the
principal
that
government
and
each
of
its
parts
remains
open
on
impartial
terms
to
all
who
seek
its
assistance.
a
law
declaring
that
in
general
it
should
be
more
difficult
for
one
group
of
citizens
control
others
to
sick
aid
from
the
government
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
the
most
literal
sense.
second,
in
addition
to
the
far
reaching
deficiencies
of
the
amendment
2
just
noted
the
principles
it
offends
in
another
sense
are
conventional
and
venerable.
a
law
must
bear
rational
relationship
to
an
illegitimate
governmental
purpose
and
amendment
2
does
not.
the
primary
rationale
that
state
offers
for
amendment
2
is
respect
for
other
citizens
freedom
of
association
and
in
particular
the
liberties
of
landlords
or
employers
who
have
personal
or
religious
objections
to
homosexuality.
colorado
also
cites
its
interest
in
conserving
resources
to
fight
discrimination
against
other
groups.
the
breadth
of
the
amendment
is
so
far
removed
from
these
justifications
colorado
offers
for
it
that
we
find
it
impossible
to
credit
them.
we
can
not
say
that
amendment
2
is
directed
to
any
identifiable
legitimate
purpose
or
discreet
objective.
it
is
a
status
based
enactment
divorced
from
any
factual
context
from
which
we
can
discern
a
relationship
to
legitimate
state
interest.
it
is
a
classification
of
persons
undertaken
for
its
own
sake
something
that
equal
protection
clause
does
not
permit.
we
must
conclude
that
amendment
2
classifies
homosexual
not
to
further
a
proper
legislative
end
but
to
make
them
unequal
to
everyone
else.
this
colorado
cannot
do.
a
state
cannot
so
deem
a
class
of
persons
a
stranger
to
its
laws.
amendment
2
violates
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
is
affirmed.
