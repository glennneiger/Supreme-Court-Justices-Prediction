mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
state
of
oklahoma
may
allocate
a
level
of
proof
as
high
as
clear
and
convincing
evidence
on
the
defendant
in
determining
his
competency
to
stand
trial.
despite
uncontroverted
expert
testimony
the
accuracy
of
which
was
not
disputed
by
the
trial
judge,
despite
testimony
from
defense
team
investigators
that
mr.
cooper
was
cracking
up
and
was
incompetent,
despite
numerous
witnesses
and
court
observations
of
peculiar
conduct
throughout
a
3
to
4-week
period
prior
to
trial,
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
in
oklahoma
failed
to
find
mr.
cooper
was
malingering,
the
court,
utilizing
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof,
held
that
mr.
cooper
was
competent
to
stand
trial.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
goes
exactly
to
the
crux
of
this
argument,
that
when
people
look
at
a
clear
and
convincing
test,
they
take
it
as
such
a
high
burden
that
despite
this
type
of
evidence
they
can
legitimately
conclude,
using
this
burden
of
proof,
or
this
standard
of
proof,
and
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
despite
all
this
evidence,
this
person
is
still
competent
to
stand
trial.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
absolutely.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
competency
standard,
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
is
a
standard
of
law.
this
particular
court
has
said
that
to
reach
this
you
need
certain
levels
of
certainty.
this
court
has
specifically
said
that
this
standard
is
used
to
take
away
a
liberty
interest,
that's
how
high
of
a
standard
it's
used
for,
and
this
standard
can
only
be
met,
and
oklahoma
used
the
term,
the
uniform
instructions
at
the
time
of
the
cooper
trial
used
the
term
unmistakable.
now,
there's
no
evidence
to
show
the
judge
used
the
term
unmistakable,
but
this
judge
was
familiar
with
the
stock
instructions,
so
he
had
to
be
satisfied
unmistakably
that
cooper
was
incompetent.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--they
said
there
was
no
evidence
from
the
record
that
unmistakable
was
used.
they
recognized
that
was
the
standard.
currently
there
was
a
different
standard
applied,
but
it
doesn't
matter,
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
is
such
a
high
burden,
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
unmistakable,
or
you
say
this
is
the
standard
necessary
to
take
one's
individual
liberties
away
from
him.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
fundamental
liberty
interest
involved
in
an
incompetent
individual
being
placed
on
trial.
our
system
of
justice
demands
that
an
individual
who
cannot
appreciate
the
consequences
of
his
actions
and
does
not
understand
the
proceedings
cannot
assist
counsel,
cannot
go
on
trial
for
his
life,
and
this
standard
takes
away
liberty
interests
of
that
individual.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
truth-seeking
process
of
a
criminal
trial
is
compromised
when
we
require
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
incompetency
before
we
go
to
trial.
that's
why
this
court
in
medina
looked
at
the
impact
on
the
particular
harm
to
the
fundamental
right.
this
court
concluded
in
medina
that
in
the
narrow
class
of
cases
where
the
evidence
was
at
equipoise...
in
other
words,
where
the
evidence
was
just
as
likely
for
competency
as
incompetency...
that
it
justified
the
risk
as
to
the
fundamental
right
not
to
be
tried
while
incompetent.
however--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--justice
o'connor,
historically
at
common
law
there
was
no
question
that
this
was...
there
was
a
preponderance
standard.
yes,
we
do
rely
on
history.
there
are
only
four
states
that
have
a
clear
and
convincing
standard.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
yes,
justice
scalia.
connecticut...
pennsylvania
was
the
first
state
adopting
it
in
1976.
connecticut
and
oklahoma
adopted
it
shortly
after
addington.
wisconsin
initially
adopted
it
after
addington,
but
has
since
changed
their
statute.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
well,
i
think
that
the
court,
or
the
oklahoma
legislators
and
the
legislators
of
connecticut
misunderstood
what
this
court
said
in
addington.
i
think
they
tried
to
combine
the
finding
of
dangerousness
necessary
for
an
indefinite
civil
commitment
with
the
standard
of
proof
utilized
for
determining
competency
hearings,
incorrectly,
i
might
add.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
well,
there--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--there's
no
problem...
we
don't
dispute
the
state's
right
to,
at
a
competency
determination,
have
the
fact-finder
make
a
determination
of
whether
the
individual
is
clear
and
convincingly
dangerous.
we
don't
dispute
that.
there's
no
question
that
they
have
an
absolute
right,
but
additionally
that's
not
even
necessary
for
the
initial
competency
determination.
oklahoma
has
a
right,
without
even
a
showing
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
violence,
to
have
someone
treated
for
a
period
of
time
to
restore
their
competency
upon
motion
of
the
individual
court.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
the
standards
involved
with
regard
to
commitment,
justice
o'connor,
are
totally
different
than
the
standards
involved
in
the
competency
determination.
in
other
words,
the
dusky
determination
for
competency
has
no
relation
to
the
subsequent
final
commitment.
that's
not
to
say
that
the
court
cannot
commit--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--i'm
not
saying
it's
not
what
may
have
caused
the
state
to
do
that,
but
you're...
as
what
i
said
in
my
reply
brief,
you're
comparing
apples
to
oranges.
in
this
particular
case,
the
standard
to
commit
somebody
has
no
relationship
to
the
determination
of
how
high,
or
the
certainty
that
we
must
have
before
we
find
an
individual
incompetent.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
that
is
correct,
but
again,
that
doesn't
go
into
effect
until
the
trial
court
has
determined
that
after
a
period
of
time
the
individual
who
is
being
treated
can
no
longer
be
continually
treated.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
that
is
correct,
justice--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--well,
i
think
the
presumption
of
competency
and
the
state
interest
is
adequately
protected
where...
in
what
medina
did,
where
the
defense
must
come
forward
with
all
evidence.
they
must
paint
a
portrait
to
the
fact-finder
that
this
particular
person
is
more
likely
than
not
incompetent,
and
if
the
fact-finder
does
not...
is
not
convinced
of
that,
regardless,
based
on
the
presumption
of
competency
or
for
whatever
reason,
the
fact-finder
is
going
to
conclude
that
the
individual
is
competent.
in
fact,
what
this
particular
standard
does
is
allow
people
that...
a
fact-finder,
the
trial
judge
himself,
he
looks
at
this
person
and
he
says,
this
person
is
more
than
likely
incompetent
to
stand
trial.
that's
what
i
think
in
my
mind
from
all
this
evidence.
yet
because
of
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
i'm
not
clear
and
convincingly
convinced,
so
therefore
i
am
not
going
to
find
this
person
incompetent,
and
this
person
is
going
to
have
to
go
through
trial.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
first
of
all,
if
the
court
concludes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
individual
is
malingering,
the
court's
going
to
conclude
that
the
defendant
hasn't
met
his
burden
of
proof
under
a
preponderance.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
raising
the
standard
of
proof
does
not
facilitate
a
more
accurate
finding
of
malingering.
let's
take
the
situation
where
we
have
100
incompetent
individuals,
okay,
5
of
whom
are
malingerers,
okay,
95
of
whom
are
not.
as
we
raise
the
level
of
certainty
requiring
an
incompetency
finding,
let's
assume
that
20
individuals
are
thereafter
now
found
competent,
one-fifth
of
the
individuals
by
virtue
of
the
raising
of
the
standard.
how
many
malingerers?
let's
assume
we
had
5
malingerers
out
of
this
100,
as
i
said.
how
many
malingerers
will
we
have
identified?
well,
if
we
do,
an
odd
one,
and
at
what
cost?
at
what
cost
to
the
fundamental
right
not
to
be
tried
while
incompetent,
because
incompetents,
if
you
go
to
trial
while
you're
incompetent...
cooper
sat
there
for
2-1/2
weeks
in
orange
coveralls
never
even
talking
to
his
attorneys.
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
scared
of
his
attorneys
from
the
testimony
of
the
experts,
yet
cooper
went
to
trial.
cooper
couldn't
assist
in
his
defense.
cooper
could
not
tell
his
lawyers
why
the
act
was
done,
how
it
was
done,
was
anybody
with
him,
the
degree
of
culpability.
competence
is
necessary
to
protect
all
sorts
of
fundamental
rights
that
are
implicit
in
the
trial
itself.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
i
think--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--yes,
we
are
following
the
due
process
clause,
but
this
court
has
applied
heightened
levels
of
due
process
in
situations
where
the
death
penalty
was
involved.
this
court,
recognizing
the
risk
in
turner
v.
murray,
said
that
in...
that
you
could
voir
dire
an
individual
on
race
and
in
a
capital
case
but
not
in
a
noncapital
case.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
no,
my
argument
is
addressed
to
every...
is
addressed
to
all
cases,
but
if
this
court
chose
to
divide
the
two
situations
they
would
have
ample
opportunities
to
do
this.
this
court
and
several
members
of
this
court
have
recognized
that
there
are
due...
different
due
process
considerations
in
a
capital
case
versus
a
noncapital
case,
but
we
are
advocating
this
across
the
board.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
i
may
be
wrong,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
believe
it's
a
preponderance
standard.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
yes.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
oh,
yes.
the
federal
statute
does
it.
this
court
in--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--this
court
in
leland
recognized...
proved
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard.
now,
it
hasn't
been
addressed
since
leland.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
this
court
has
never
recognized
that
insanity
defense
was
a
fundamental
right.
i
believe
that
you
said
that
in
medina,
that
they've
never
recognized
this
as
a
fundamental
right.
this
obviously
would
be
different
if
a
court
was
instructing
someone
that
they
couldn't
take
insanity
into
consideration
in
determining
whether
a
defendant
proved...
had
been
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
elements
of
the
crime,
but
once
the
elements
have
in
fact
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
this
court
has
never
said
that
the
insanity
defense
is
a
fundamental
right.
whereas
here
we
have
a
fundamental
right,
and
here
we
have
a
right
before
any
evidence
of
guilt
has
been
established
by
the
state,
and
that's
what's
so
different.
again,
we've
got
to
look
at
the
truth-seeking
function
and
what
it
does
to
the
criminal
trial
when
we
require
somebody
to
prove
with
this
kind
of
certainty
that
he's
more
likely
than
not
incompetent.
who
is
going
to
be
brought
to
trial?
people
who
are
more--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--as
early
as
1790,
justice
scalia,
in
ley's
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
judge
remanded
the
individual
to
a
surgeon
to
have
the
surgeon
look
at
him,
so
we've
had
people
looking
at
competency
for
over
200
years
on
that
particular
theme.
but
additionally,
let's
look
at
the
resources.
what
that
court
said--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--that's
correct,
but
probably
in
1790
that
was
probably
the
best
we
could
do.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
but
i
think
when
we
look
at
that,
let's
look
at
the
experts.
how
many
experts
do
we
have
to
prove?
what
kind
of
cost
to
the
system?
how
many
experts?
do
we
have
to
have
five
experts,
six
experts?
we
had
one
uncontroverted
expert.
and
again,
should
the
defendant
be
required
to
come
forward
with
that
kind
of
evidence,
and
at
what
risk?
this
court
specifically
said
in
a
narrow
situation
where
the
evidence
is
at
equipoise,
that's
one
thing,
but
the
tie
goes
to
the
state
after
medina,
there's
no
question.
if
i
don't
come
forward
with
evidence,
if
i
don't
come
forward
with
the
psychiatrist,
if
i
don't
come
forward
with
friends--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--with
doctors,
with--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--i
have
to
convince
that
fact-finder.
i
have
to
show
all
this.
the
state
can
actually
hide
behind
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
they
can
paint
less
of
a
picture.
yes.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
if--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--i
think
clearly
under
dusky
that
person
could
not
be
tried.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
well
now,
dusky
just
establishes
the
standard,
but
an
interpretation--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--if
that
person
cannot--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--then
that
person
cannot
be
brought
to
trial.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
that
person
cannot
be
brought
to
trial.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
well,
dusky
establishes
the
two-prong
test
for
determining
competency.
if
the
person
cannot
assist
his
lawyer
in
presenting
a
defense--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--then
you
can't...
assist--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
the
picture
that
the
fact-finder
gets
with
regards
to
a
preponderance
standard
is
the
most
accurate
picture,
because
the
defendant
must
come
forward
with
all
sorts
of
evidence
to
prove
his
incompetency.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
well,
obviously
i
think
this
court
would
follow...
medina
was
a
five-member
majority,
so
i
think
this
court
is
bound
to
follow
medina.
i
think
that
the...
mathews
is
a
useful
guide,
looking
at
the
interests
at
stake.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
i
think
when
you
look
at
basic
fairness,
justice
stevens,
it's
just
as
compelling
as
history,
maybe
even
more
compelling
than
history,
because
basic
fairness--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--that's
correct,
but
fairness
is
just
as
compelling.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
yes,
but
i
think
we
have
to
realize
what--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--what
we
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
impact
of
this
standard
on
the
fundamental
constitutional
right
not
to
be
tried
while
incompetent,
and
if
we
look
at
the
impact,
what
we're
saying
is,
we're
going
to
have
a
group
of
individuals
who
are
now
more
than
likely
incompetent,
who
are
going
to
go
on
trial
for
their
life,
who
are
going
to
have
an
opportunity
to
get
before
a
judge
and
waive
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel,
are
going
to
go
before
a
judge
and
plead
guilty,
make
decisions
on
whether
to...
not
to
testify,
or,
too,
to
testify,
and
that's
the
risk
that
we
take,
and
what
interest
does
the
state
have?
what
interest
has
the
state
shown
in
their
brief?
the
only
interest
the
state
really
shows
is,
i
can
show
it's
okay
for
me
to
try
individuals
who
are
more
likely
than
not
incompetent
because
i
want
to
move
them
through
the
court
system.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
by
the
statute
at
both
provisions
on
the
determination
on
the
application
and
on
the
post
examination
competency
hearing,
the
issues
reserved
for
the
judge
are
then
reserved
for
the
jury,
and
the
jury
will
make
those
findings.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
addington
cannot
be
read
to
require
the
individual
to
bear
a
high
burden
before
his
constitutional
rights
will
be
honored.
the
judge
in
this
case
was
given
an
opportunity
to
find
malingering.
the
prosecutor
argued
it.
the
judge
did
not
find
malingering.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
yes,
sir...
yes,
ma'am.
you
can't
win
a
jury
trial
on
incompetency
on
a
clear
and
convincing
standard.
it's
impossible.
it's
just
not
done.
that's
why
we
never
asked
for
it.
we
hope
that
the
trial
judge
will
do
it.
in
the
other
states
that
mr.
edmondson
talks
about,
they
all
do
it
with
decisionmaker
satisfaction,
or
something
similar
to
that.
i'll
take
decisionmaker
satisfaction.
but
here,
the
decisionmaker
was
able
to
utilize
this
higher
standard,
a
standard
that
was
initially
enunciated
to
protect
individual--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--i
think--
mr.
robert
alan
ravitz
--less
than
4
years
ago,
justice
scalia,
in
medina,
this
court
said
it
was
a
fundamental
right.
i
mean,
if
the
court
says
it's
not
an
important
fundamental...
to
me,
it's
really
important.
to
me,
it's
real
important
to
be
able
to
talk
to
my
client,
to
be
able
to
find
out
about
the
case,
to
find
out
the
individual's
culpability,
and
i
can't
do
that
when
my
client
is
incompetent,
and
we...
oklahoma
is
asking
you
to
try
individuals
who
are
more
than
likely
incompetent,
and
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
minimizing
correct
or
just
determinations
of
competency,
and
that
is
exactly
what
they're
doing.
thank
you.
