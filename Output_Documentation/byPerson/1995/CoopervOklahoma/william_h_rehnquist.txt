chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
another
case
coming
up
that
we're
going
to
hear
right
now,
and
that
case
is
number
95-5207,
cooper
v.
oklahoma.
mr.
ravitz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
the
evidence
was
so
overwhelming,
as
you
describe
it,
mr.
ravitz,
one
would
think
that
it
met
even
a
clear
and
convincing
test.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
as
a
matter
of
law?
i
take
it
the
state
is
certainly
entitled
to
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
person
who
is
claiming
to
be
mentally
incompetent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so,
if
you
say...
you
say
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
trier
of
fact
is
free
to
disbelieve
witnesses,
so
i
don't
see
where
you
get
as
a
matter
of
law
coming
out
of
this.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
to
say...
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
didn't
use
the
word
unmistakable,
did
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the
one
that
decided...
did
it
use
the
word
unmistakable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
is
intermediate
as
i've
understood
it
and
as
i
think
our
opinions...
between
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
which
obtains
in
most
civil
cases,
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
is
what
you
have
to
find
guilt
by.
it's...
obviously,
it's
higher
than
the
preponderance,
but
it's
lower
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
what
is
it
that
enables
us
to
say
that
it
ought
to
be
one
rather
than
the
other?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
can
hear
you
pretty
well,
mr.--
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
mentioned
what
it
thought
was
a
propensity
of
some
defendants
to
malinger
in
this
area
as
a
justification
for
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
it's
quite
possible
that
a...
the
trial
judge
may
feel,
i
can't
say
for
sure
that
this
person
is
malingering,
but
if
i
had
to
do
it
by
a
preponderance
standard,
i
would
have
to
say
he's
incompetent,
but
clear
and
convincing,
i
can
say
i
think
he's
competent,
and
can't
a
state
court
adopt
a
rule
of
burden
of
proof
to
adjust
for
that
sort
of
thing,
the
possibility
of
malingering,
even
though
it's
not...
you
can't
show
it
in
a
particular
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ravitz.
general
edmondson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
the
post
examination,
does
it
first
go
to
a
judge
and
he...
because
here,
i
gather,
it
didn't
go
to
a
jury.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
here,
at
first
the
judge
makes
the
determination?
chief
justice
rehnquist
here
a
jury
trial
was
not
demanded.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
could
have
been
had.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
in
this
case
the
judge
made
it
in
a
bench
trial,
on
effect.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
general
edmondson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
ravitz,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ravitz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-5207,
cooper
against
oklahoma
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
