justice
o'connor
--do
you
rely
on
historical
practice
in
this
case?
do
we
know
what
states
have
required
in
this
area,
and
do
we
know
how
many
states
are
now
changing
to
this
higher
standard
of
proof?
justice
o'connor
but
i
guess
the
reason
states
are
now
experimenting
with
requiring
a
higher
standard
of
proof
of
competency
is
because
of
addington's
requirement
that
to
civilly
commit
someone
the
proof
must
be
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
dangerousness
to
self
or
others
and
of
mental
illness.
justice
o'connor
but
that
is
what's
driving
the
states
to
adopt
a
different
standard
on
competency,
i
suppose,
the
hope
that
they
won't
have
someone
found
to
be
incompetent
in
a
criminal
case
and
then...
for
mental
disability,
and
yet
not
be
able
to
commit
them
for
civil
treatment.
justice
o'connor
well,
you're
basing
your
argument
on
the
due
process
clause?
justice
o'connor
are
you
not
pressing
any
eighth
amendment
claim
here?
justice
o'connor
there's
some
language
in
your
brief,
but
i
thought
it
ought
to
be
clear.
you're
basically
resting
on
the
due
process
clause.
justice
o'connor
yes
or
no?
justice
o'connor
so
you're
not
making
a
general
argument
applicable
to
all
criminal
defendants.
you
want
us
to
just
address
the
situation
in
the
capital
context?
justice
o'connor
was
an
insanity
defense
made
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
and
the
statute
has
been
changed
since
this
case
was
tried
on
the
clear
and
convincing
standard?
the
language
is
different
now?
justice
o'connor
it
used
to
say
it
had
to
be
unmistakable
proof.
justice
o'connor
now,
there
wouldn't
be
a
jury
trial
in
oklahoma
on
the
decision
of
competency
made
by
the
trial
judge?
justice
o'connor
on
that
question.
justice
o'connor
in
the
criminal
case,
would
you
explain
exactly
how
the
oklahoma
system
works
if
a
defendant
says
through
counsel
i
want
to
challenge
this
defendant's
competence
to
stand
trial?
justice
o'connor
but
then
who
makes
the
determination
of
whether
the
defendant
is
competent
or
not
after
the
application
is
accepted
and
the
examination
is
conducted?
justice
o'connor
of
course,
this
could
be
one
of
those
cases.
the
trial
judge
at
least
said,
because
of
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
i'm
going
to
find
competence
here,
even
though
reading
the
cold
record
might
cause
one
to
really
question
the
result,
at
least
under
a
preponderance
standard.
justice
o'connor
now,
the
defendant
here
never
asked
for
a
jury
determination
of
competency.
justice
o'connor
why
is
that?
were
you
involved
at
the
trial?
