justice
scalia
how
recently
did
they
adopt
that,
would
you
remind
me?
justice
scalia
why
did
addington
cause
them
to
adopt
it?
justice
scalia
well,
it's
certainly
convenient
to
combine
the
two,
so
that
if
the
person
can't
be
tried
he
can
be
put
away.
i
mean,
once
you
make
that...
right?
justice
scalia
if
there
is
a
clear
and
convincing
indication,
two
things
happen.
number
1,
you
can't
try
him,
and
number
2,
he
also
does
not
walk
away.
he
gets
put
into
a
mental
institution.
that's
pretty
handy,
you
must
admit.
justice
scalia
if
you're
going
to
talk
about,
you
know,
realities,
you
know,
i
think
the
history
is
with
you.
i'm
not
sure
the
realities
are.
once
upon
a
time
you
could
not
put
on
a
parade
of
psychiatrists
who
will
testify
that
this
person
has
all
sorts
of
new
mental
afflictions
that
nobody
ever
heard
of.
it's
very
easy
to
raise
a
doubt
of
concern
in
competence
nowadays,
as
it
was
not
much
earlier.
the
fact-finder
could
just
look
at
this
person
and
make
his
own
judgment.
now,
he
has
to
listen
to
a
parade
of
expert
witnesses,
and
it's
always...
in
my
experience,
you
can
find
a
psychiatrist
who
will
say
that
this
person
is
not
competent.
justice
scalia
a
surgeon
is
not
a
psychiatrist.
justice
scalia
yes,
right.
justice
scalia
mr.
ravitz,
you
need
both,
don't
you?
i
mean,
all
history
shows
you
is
that
it
may
be
a
fundamental
right
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
if
it
never
existed
in
history,
it
certainly
is
not.
if
it
did
exist
in
history,
you
still
have
to
ask
the
question,
well,
yes,
there
was
always
a
12-person
jury
historically.
does
that
mean
that
it's
a
lack
of
due
process
if
you
don't
have
a
12-person
jury,
have
a
new
rule,
have
10
instead?
you
have
to
ask
yourself
was
it
important
enough,
so
you
really
do
have
to
get
to
the
importance
question
anyway,
regardless
of
what
the
history
says,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
you
wouldn't
if
the
history
was
the
other
way,
if
the
history
showed
that...
you
know,
that
there
had
never
been
a
right
to
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
claim,
then
you
lose
without
any
further
inquiry,
but
having
established
that
there
was
historically,
you
still
have
to
show
that
it's
so
essential
to
our
form
of
ordered
liberty
that
it
can't
be
changed.
justice
scalia
general
edmondson,
i
must
say,
what
oklahoma
has
done
with
respect
to
the
defense
of
insanity
on
the
merits
at
trial
casts
a
great
deal
of
doubt
in
my
mind
concerning
the
necessity
of
the
standard
that
oklahoma
has
adopted
with
respect
to
sanity
to
stand
trial.
you're
willing
to
accept
the
burden
of
proving
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
individual
was
sane
2
years
ago
when
he
committed
the
crime,
but
you
say
it's
too
onerous
to
accept
the
burden
of
proving
to
the
jury
by...
or
not
even
proving
to
the
jury.
it's
too
onerous
to
have
the
defendant
prove
to
the
jury
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he's
sane
today.
it
seems
to
me
sanity
2
years
ago
is
a
lot
harder
to
prove,
and
the
state
accepts
a
much
higher
burden
with
respect
to
that.
justice
scalia
so
in
fact
it's
not
just
25
to
25.
the
line
up
is
less
favorable
to
you
than
that.
justice
scalia
in
any
case,
as
long
as
that
continues,
you're
still
alive,
aren't
you?
justice
scalia
which
is
a
good
thing
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
a
separate
diagnosis?
you
mean
that
itself
is
a
psychiatric
disease,
malingering
is?
justice
scalia
oh.
justice
scalia
--so--
--of
course,
you're
not
prepared
to
concede,
i
take
it,
that
innocent
people
are
necessarily
going
to
go
to
prison
because
of
this.
all
that
we're
talking
about
is
deprivation
of
the
value,
whatever
it's
worth,
of
being
able
to
advise
your
attorney
during
the
proceeding,
and
you
know,
it's
not
clear
how
many
defendants
profit
considerably
from
being
able
to
advise
their
attorney
during
the
trial.
justice
scalia
how
fundamental
is
this
right,
mr.
ravitz?
that's
what
it
comes
to.
justice
scalia
we've...
it's
always
been...
some
legal
systems,
of
course,
allow
a
trial
in
absentia,
where
he's
not
only
incompetent,
he's
not
even
there.
he's
not
even
physically
there,
much
less
mentally
there.
