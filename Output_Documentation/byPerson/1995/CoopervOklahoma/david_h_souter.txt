justice
souter
some
of
those
states
that
do
something
different
in
fact
put
the
burden
on
the
state,
don't
they?
justice
souter
but
i'm
just
saying
that
if
there
are
25
states
that
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
by
a
preponderance,
and
there
are
25
who
do
not,
some
of
the
25
who
do
not
in
fact
place
a
burden
not
on
the
defendant
at
all,
but
upon
the
state.
i
come
from
one
of
those,
and
i
know
it's
not
unique,
so
it...
i'm
just
saying
that
this
is
not
an
evenly
balanced
division
among
the
states.
justice
souter
but
it
is
accurate,
isn't
it,
that
of
the
states
that
place
the
burden
on
the
defendant,
only
four
place
that
burden
to
a
degree
of
clear
and
convincing.
the
others
have
a
lesser
burden.
justice
souter
well,
there's
a
meshing...
i
recognize
the
fact
that
if
you
had
defendant's
burden
being
preponderance
to
show
incompetence,
state's
burden
being
clear
and
convincing
to
commit,
that
there
is
in
fact
a
kind
of
gap
between
them
in
which
some
might
fall.
i
take
it,
simply
because
i
haven't
heard
anything
about
it,
that
there
is
no
indication
that
in
fact
any
substantial
number
of
defendants
were
in
fact
walking
away
from
the
courthouse
having,
under
the
preponderance
standard
having
shown
that
they
were
incompetent,
but
with
the
state
being
incapable
to
commit
them.
justice
souter
that
wasn't
a
serious
problem,
was
it?
justice
souter
yes,
well,
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
tell,
whereas
the
question
that
i
raised
would
be
very
easy
to
answer.
we'd
just
have
to
look
at
the
courthouse
door
and
see
who
was
walking
out,
and
i
take
it
that
there's
no
indication
that
was
happening
to
the
degree
of
raising
a
systemic
problem.
justice
souter
general
edmondson,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
or
any
references
to
studies
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
in
the
last
20
or
30
years
juries
or
judges
as
fact-finders
have
in
fact
been
getting
hoodwinked
either
by
malingerers
or
by
psychiatrists?
and
i'll
be
candid
to
say...
i
was
a
trial
judge
once,
and
i'll
be
candid
to
say
that
i
thought
juries
were
very
good
at
smelling
this
sort
of
thing
out
and
i
never,
as
a
trial
judge,
had
the
impression
that
juries
were
particularly
impressed
with
psychiatric
testimony
at
all,
and
i...
is
there
any
indication
that
in
fact
the
practice
of
deception
was
more
successful
than
i
was
observing
it?
justice
souter
i
would...
let
me
ask
you...
i
don't
want
to
go
off
on
a
tangent
of
the
details
of
this
case,
but
if
he
really
had
demanded
a
jury
trial,
wouldn't
the
state
have
had
the
opportunity
to
require
his
counsel
to
testify
after
there
being
a
substitution
of
counsel?
justice
souter
so
probably
you
could
have
gotten
it
in
front
of
the
jury
if
it
had
become
a
jury
issue.
