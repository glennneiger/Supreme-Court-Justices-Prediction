justice
kennedy
but
in
either
case
there
is
a
presumption
of
competency
that
most
jurisdictions,
if
not
all
jurisdictions,
recognize,
i
take
it.
justice
kennedy
and
addington
said
that
presumption
of
competency
is
sufficiently
valid
that
we're
going
to
require
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
overcome
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
all
that
oklahoma
is
saying
here,
is
that
we
are
giving...
we
are
giving
substance,
we
are
giving
recognition,
we
are
giving
force
to
the
presumption
of
competency.
now,
i
recognize
that
you
can
have
different
standards
for
commitment
than
for
assisting
counsel
at
your
trial
and
so
forth,
but
leaving
that
aside,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
oklahoma
is
doing
is
giving
vigor
and
substance
to
the
presumption
of
competency.
justice
kennedy
and
the
jury
trial
obviously
would
precede
the
trial
on
the
charges.
justice
kennedy
actually
a
different
jury.
justice
kennedy
and
whether
or
not
it's
for
the
jury
or
the
trial
judge
it's
clear
and
convincing,
that's
the
standard.
