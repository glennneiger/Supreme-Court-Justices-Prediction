justice
ginsburg
what
about
the
standard
in
the
state
for
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity?
that's
incompetence
at
the
time
the
act
was
committed
to
have
the
necessary
state
of
mind.
what
is
oklahoma's
standard
for
that
defense?
justice
ginsburg
just
a
preponderance.
justice
ginsburg
so
could
the
state
have
a
higher
standard?
could
it
say,
an
ngi
acquittal
has
to
be
established
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
justice
ginsburg
even
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
ginsburg
then
how
do
you...
that
also
involves
the
same
kind
of
fundamental
right,
doesn't
it,
not
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime
when
one
is
not
able
to
form
the
mental
state
necessary?
justice
ginsburg
--what
about
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
could
oklahoma
go
that
far?
could
you
say,
we
have
a
real
problem
with
people
faking
it,
so
we
want
to
ratchet
it
up
one
notch
higher
and
say,
if
you're
going
to
avoid
trial
on
grounds
of
incompetency,
you
have
to
show
you're
incompetent
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
is
that--
justice
ginsburg
are
you
saying
there
isn't
any
fundamental
right
involved,
because
that's
important.
if
there
is
a
fundamental
right
involved,
that's
one
thing.
if
there
isn't,
then
there's
no
due
process
claim
here,
but
i
thought
you
recognized
that
yes,
there
is
a
fundamental
right
not
to
stand
trial
when
one
doesn't
understand
what's
going
on.
justice
ginsburg
all
right.
if
there
is
that
fundamental
right
not
to
be
tried
while
incompetent,
can
the
state
say,
but
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
prove...
to
have
available
that
fundamental
right
you
have
to
show
incompetency
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
thought
you
said
that
would
be
going
too
far,
that
that
would
cross
the
constitutional...
that
would
go
from
what's
constitutional--
