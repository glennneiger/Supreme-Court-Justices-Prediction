justice
stevens
but
isn't--
--well,
it--
--doesn't
the
point...
let's
see,
if
the
burden...
the
different...
in
the
two
different
cases,
in
one,
the
plaintiff,
i
mean,
the
individual
seeks...
the
higher
standard
in
the
addington
context
is
to
protect
the
individual.
the
lower
standard
in
the
criminal
context
is
to
protect
the
individual,
because
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
incompetence
in
the
criminal
case,
and
the
state
has
the
burden
in
the
civil
case.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
more
than
coming
forward.
justice
stevens
it's
more
than
coming
forward.
you
have
to
have,
at
least
have
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
you
have
to
have
at
least
51
percent
probability.
justice
stevens
mr.
edmondson,
may
i
ask
you--
--no,
it's
mr.--
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
ravitz.
i
looked
at
the
wrong
name.
may
i
ask
you
just
on
your
basic
theory
of
the
case,
in
the
last
case
we
had
there
were
two
different
opinions
supporting
majority
result.
one
relied
on
the
mathews
analysis,
and
the
other
relied
on
patterson
v.
new
york,
a
more
historical
analysis.
do
you
have
a
preference
between
the
two
as
to
what
you
think
should
be
followed
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
but
you
would
follow
a
patterson
approach,
and
then
your
emphasis
would
be
on
history,
i
gather,
rather
than
on
basic
fairness.
justice
stevens
how
could
it
be
more
compelling
than
history?
if
your
brief
is
right,
and
i
don't
know
if
they
challenged
or
not,
all
the
history,
except
for
these
four
responses
to
the
addington,
all
the
history
says
preponderance.
justice
stevens
1175
is...
that's
your
civil
commitment
statute--
--yes...
no.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
to
clarify
one
thing?
i
understand
clearly
when
someone
else
seeks
to
have
the
individual
judged
incompetent,
then
the
individual
can
ask
for
a
jury
trial
and
insist
on
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
but
now,
when
the
individual
himself
says
i
am
not
competent
to
stand
trial,
does
he
also
ask
for
a
jury
trial
on
that
issue?
he's
trying
to
prove
his
own
incompetence.
justice
stevens
is
that
ever
done
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
criminal
trials
in
oklahoma?
justice
stevens
no.
no,
i'm
asking
about
criminal
trials
in
which
the
defendant
himself
seeks
to
establish
his
own
incompetence.
is
it
common
to
have
the
issue
submitted
to
a
jury?
justice
stevens
it
is.
justice
stevens
but
that
doesn't
make
sense,
because
the
burden
on
the
state,
if
you
lose
on
the
insanity
issue
he
walks.
if
you
lose
on
this
issue
you
just
keep
him
in
custody
until
he
improves,
and
then
you
try
him
later.
justice
stevens
well,
at
least
he's
acquitted
of
the
crime.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
he
doesn't
have
the
criminal...
whereas
in
this
case
it's
only
a
temporary
delay
in
the
trial,
and
you
can
in
the
meantime
medicate
him,
and
treat
him
to
try
and
restore
his
competency,
so
it
seems
to
me
the
cost
of
losing
on
the
insanity
is
much
heavier
for
the
state
than
the
cost
of
a
temporary
delay
in
the
trial,
in
this
proceeding.
justice
stevens
but
if
a
party
other
than
the
defendant
raises
the
question
and
wants
to
commit
the
defendant,
must
that
party
prove
more
than
incompetence?
must
the
party
also
prove
a
danger
to
himself
or
the
community?
justice
stevens
but
the
defendant
need
not
prove
the
danger
of
that
kind
in
order
to
establish
incompetence
to
stand
trial.
justice
stevens
so
that
if
the
defendant
carries
his
burden,
even
under
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
he
will
not
necessarily
receive
civil
commitment,
will
he?
justice
stevens
because
there
are
different
issues
in
the
case.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
issues
are
sufficiently
different
that
you
could
not
say
that
in
the
routine
case
of
the
criminal
defendant
seeking
to
establish
his
own
incompetence,
if
he
prevails
at
the
hearing
he
will
not
necessarily
be
civilly
committed.
justice
stevens
but
of
course,
the
unable
to
be
restored
element
of
it,
he
would
be
trying
to
prove
that
himself,
would
he?
normally
he
wouldn't
have
to
do
that
in
order
to
prevail
to
postpone
the
trial.
justice
stevens
and
certainly
the
state
wouldn't
be
trying
to
prove
that.
justice
stevens
because
then
you'd
be
permanently
civilly
committed.
justice
stevens
but
as
soon
as
you
lose
that
finding,
you
could
be
tried
for
the
crime.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
likelihood
of
malingering
is
just
one
of
the
facts
the
trier
of
fact
has
to
take
into
consideration
in
reaching
the
ultimate
conclusion,
and
it
necessarily
follows,
as
i
understand
the
oklahoma
system,
that
there
at
least
exists
the
possibility
that
there
are
a
class
of
people
who
are
more
likely
than
not
incompetent.
taking
into
account
malingering
and
all
of
this,
more
likely
than
not
they
are
incompetent,
and
therefore
under
most
states
they
wouldn't
try
them
until
they'd
recovered,
but
in...
oklahoma
is
willing
to
say,
no,
you
go
to
trial
anyway.
justice
stevens
no,
they've
had
the
hearing,
and
after
the
hearing
the
conclusion
might
be,
it's
55
percent
chance
they're
incompetent,
but
it's
not
a
65
or
75
percent
chance
so
we're
going
to
let...
the
risk
of
error
is
placed
on
the
defendant
in
those
cases.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
multiple
opportunities
would
be
there
regardless
of
the
standard.
even
if
you
reduce
the
standard,
you'd
still
give
the
same
multiple
opportunities.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
all
of
those
features
of
the
system
could
remain
in
place
under
a
different
standard.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
even
the
psychiatrists
can
tell.
you
got
that
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma.
petitioner
cooper
was
convicted
in
that
state
of
first-degree
murder.
his
bizarre
behavior
and
refusal
or
inability
to
communicate
with
counsel
put
petitioner’s
competence
to
stand
trial
at
issue
both
before
and
during
the
trial.
it
is
well
settled
that
due
process
prohibits
the
trial
of
an
incompetent
defendant.
in
previous
cases,
we
have
defined
competence
to
stand
trial
as
the
present
ability
to
understand
the
charges
against
you
and
to
assist
your
attorney
in
making
defense
to
those
charges.
under
oklahoma
law,
a
criminal
defendant
who
claims
to
be
incompetence
to
stand
trial
or
whose
attorney
makes
this
claim
on
his
behalf
is
required
to
demonstrate
incompetence
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
a
heightened
standard
of
proof
which
falls
somewhere
between
preponderance
of
the
evidence
which
is
the
normal
civil
standard
and
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
the
standard
for
criminal
conviction.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
application
of
oklahoma’s
heightened
evidence
rule
violated
petitioner’s
federal
constitutional
right
to
due
process
by
infringing
on
his
fundamental
rights
to
be
tried
only
while
competent.
the
okalahoma
state
court
rejected
petitioner’s
due
process
claim.
the
state
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
risk
of
criminal
defendant’s
feigning
incompetence
combined
with
the
state’s
interest
in
the
efficient
functioning
of
its
judicial
process
justify
the
clear
and
convincing
standards.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
we
conclude
that
oklahoma’s
clear
and
convincing
evidence
rule
has
no
substantial
roots
in
prior
practice.
at
common
law
courts
typically
required
a
criminal
defendant
to
prove
his
incompetence
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
even
today
only
three
states
in
addition
to
oklahoma
plays
a
burden
as
high
as
clear
and
convincing
evidence
on
the
defendant.
the
remaining
46
states
as
well
as
the
federal
government
pose
a
lesser
burden.
moreover
we
find
that
the
rule
is
fundamentally
unfair
in
practice.
oklahoma’s
clear
and
convincing
evidence
test
allows
the
state
to
precede
the
trial,
even
when
the
defendant
has
demonstrated
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
he
is
incompetent.
the
consequences
of
preceding
the
trial
while
incompetent
are
serious
for
the
defendant.
other
constitutional
rights
such
as
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
the
right
to
testify
in
one’s
own
defense
can
only
be
adequately
exercised
by
a
competent
person.
we
find
that
oklahoma’s
interest
in
the
efficient
operation
of
his
criminal
justice
system
is
insufficient
to
overcome
the
defendant’s
fundamental
right
not
to
be
tried
while
incompetent.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
