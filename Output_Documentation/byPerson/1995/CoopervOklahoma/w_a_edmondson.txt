mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
burden
of
proof
at
issue
here
today
is
not
a
stand-alone
provision.
it
is
part
of
a
procedure,
a
system
involved
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
it
was
designed
to
do
essentially
two
things:
1)
minimize
the
risk
of
false
findings
of
incompetency
based
upon
fabricated
symptoms,
and
2)
while
still
preserving,
protecting,
and
safeguarding
the
fundamental
due
process
right
not
to
be
tried
while
incompetent.
if
i
could,
before
i
go
into
the
substance
of
my
argument,
respond
to
a
couple
of
questions
that
were
asked
earlier,
justice
ginsburg
asked
what
the
burden
of
proof
was
in
an
insanity
case
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
under
the
statutes
and
case
law
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
the
defendant
has
an
initial
burden
showing
that
his
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
is
at
risk.
it
is
then
placed
upon
the
state
to
show
the
defendant's
sanity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
part
of
the
elements
that
are
proved
in
the
case-in-chief.
the
other
question
by
justice
breyer
was
what
happens
if
a
defendant
is
by
physical
problems
rendered
incapable?
the
example
of
coma
was
given,
and
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
on
determination
of
competency
at
1175.1
et
seq
provide
not
only
for
the
mental
ability
to
proceed
but
also
incompetency
by
reason
of
physical
disability.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
no,
justice
o'connor.
there
were
questions
raised
in
the
second
stage
in
particular
about
the
defendant's
terrible
upbringing,
about
his
childhood,
about
the
pressures
that
were
brought
upon
him
and
the
fact
that
he
was
terribly
disadvantaged
as
a
child,
but
the
defense
to
the
case
was
not
guilty.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
the
uniform
jury
instruction--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--the
uniform...
it
was
clear
unmistakable
and
convincing
in
the
uniform
jury
instruction,
which
may
well
have
come
into
play
had
there
been
a
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
competency.
now,
that
jury
instruction
did
not
comport
with
the
law
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
as
enunciated
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
is
found
in
the
case
of
matter
of
c.g.,
a
1981
case
that
predated
this
trial,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
which
was
cited
by
the
amicus
american
association
on
mental
retardation.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
yes,
ma'am,
there
is
a
right
to
demand
a
jury
trial
at
two
stages--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--on
two
stages
in
the
competency
proceedings
under
1175.1,
and
that's
why
i
stress,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
burden
of
proof
has
to
be
examined
in
the
context
of
the
entire
system.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
no,
on
the
competency
proceeding.
under
our--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--certainly.
the
process
is
initiated
by
an
application
to
determine
competency
which
must
state
facts
sufficient
to
raise
a
doubt,
not
even
a
bona
fide
doubt
as
required
by
pate
v.
robinson
and
the
drope
case,
but
just
a
doubt
as
to
the
competency
of
the
defendant.
that
application
can
be
brought
by
the
accused,
by
a
relative
of
the
accused,
by
a
friend
of
the
accused,
by
a
person
with
whom
the
accused
resides,
by
a
person
in
whose
house
the
accused
lived,
or
certainly
by
accused's
counsel.
if
the
application
is
determined
to
raise
a
legitimate
doubt,
or
even
a
doubt
as
to
the
defendant's
competency
to
stand
trial,
the
defendant
then
is
remanded
for
an
examination
by
experts,
and
subsequent
to
that
examination,
there
is
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
the
application.
the
defendant
or
any
of
those
parties
that
i
mentioned
have
the
right
to
demand
a
jury
trial
to
determine
whether
there's
even
a
doubt
as
to
his
competency,
a
jury
trial
to
trigger
the
examination
by
experts.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
he
has
the
right
to
demand
a
jury
trial.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
justice
stevens,
it's
common
on
the
post
examination
competency
hearing.
jury
trials--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--yes.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
on
the
post
examination
competency
hearing.
it
is
much
less
common
on
the
application
itself.
the
application
is
designed
to
raise
a
doubt
as
to
its
competency
because
uniformly
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
those
are
granted.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
mr.
chief
justice,
the
matter...
when
the
examination
is
completed
and
a
report
is
made
back
to
the
court,
the
matter
is
set
for
post
examination
competency
hearing,
and
then
the
question
is
asked,
do
you
demand
a
jury
trial,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
it
would
not
be
the
same
jury,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
yes,
sir,
a
different
jury,
because
under
oklahoma
statutes
nothing
that
is
said
by
the
accused
in
the
context
of
a
post
examination
competency
hearing
can
be
used
against
the
accused
in
any
proceeding
whatsoever,
and
so
the
same
jury
categorically
could
not
hear
that
evidence.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
justice
scalia,
to
some
extent
that
emphasizes
the
risk
that
oklahoma
feels
on
a
determination
of
present
competency,
where
the
incentive
to
malinger
or
to
create
symptoms
is
much
greater,
in
our
estimation,
than
the
prescience
of
the
defendant
to
try
to
create
those
kinds
of
manifestations
at
the
time
he's
committing
an
offense.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
no,
justice
stevens.
on
a
finding
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
the
cost
may
be
heavier,
your
honor,
but
we
feel
that
the
ability
to
prove
present
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense,
when
the
defendant
will
not
contemporaneously
be
trying
to
manifest
symptoms
of
incompetence,
but
will
simply
be
carrying
out
the
commission
of
an
offense,
is
a
manageable
burden
for
the
state
of
oklahoma.
we
feel
greater
jeopardy,
particularly
in
a
serious
case,
being
able
to
meet
on
a
preponderance
level
the
ability
of
fabricated
symptoms
by
a
defendant
falsely
claiming
to
be
incompetent.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
justice
breyer,
of
course,
it's
easier
to
respond
to
the
coma
argument
because
they
very--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--thank
you.
coma,
of
course,
rarely
arises
spontaneously
during
the
context--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--in
terms
of
the
allocation
of
the
risk
of
error,
which
i
believe
is
the
direction
that
we're
heading
in,
i
again
point
to
the
entire
context
of
oklahoma
system
rather
than
simply
the
burden
of
proof.
also
embodied
in
oklahoma
statutes
is
the
fact
that
the
issue
can
be
raised
at
any
time
during
the
proceedings,
which
means
if
the
issue
is
raised
early
on
and
the
decision
is
not
satisfactory
to
the
accused--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--i
would
like
to
respond
first
of
all
if
i
could,
justice
breyer,
to
the
allegation
that
assigning
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
the
uniform
or
even
the
overwhelming
practice
of
the
states.
it
is
not.
there
are
25
states
that
assign
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
25
states
that
do
something
different.
i
would
certainly
not
claim
that
clear
and
convincing
is
by
any
stretch
the
majority.
i
think
there
are
four
states--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--yes.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
justice
souter,
there
are
25
that
use
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
other
states
may
or
may
not
allocate
a
burden,
but
we're
talking
about
the
level
of
proof.
some
states
don't
say
what
the
level
of
proof
is
at
all.
two
states--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--that
is
exactly
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make.
if
there
was
a
very
wide
variety
of
approaches
to
the
competency
issue
among
the
50
states,
that
it
is
not
four
states
have
clear
and
convincing
and
everybody
else
has
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that
is
not
accurate.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
that
is
correct,
justice
souter,
except
oklahoma
does
not
place
it
on
the
defendant,
oklahoma
places
it
on
the
party
that
raises
it,
and
there
could
be
instances
where
the
state
of
oklahoma--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
that
is
correct
also.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
not
necessarily.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
but
interestingly,
in
oklahoma's
statute
we
incorporate
in
title
22,
our
criminal
provisions,
the
provisions
out
of
title
43
on
involuntary
commitment
and,
at
the
post
examination
competency
hearing
stage,
if
the
jury
or
the
judge
determines
that
this
individual
is
incompetent,
is
not
capable
of
regaining
competence
within
the
foreseeable
future,
and
is
a
person
who
is
mentally
ill
as
defined
under
title
43
and
is
dangerous,
then
that
same
hearing
can
result
in
the
civil
commitment
under
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
mandated
by
addington.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
i
certainly
would
not
say
that
that
would
be
a
routine
decision,
justice
stevens.
i
would
say
in
a
case,
for
instance,
like
this
one,
where
there
are
allegations
of
mental
illness
and
where
there
is
evidence
of
dangerousness,
had
there
been
a
finding
that
this
defendant
was
incompetent
and
unable
to
be
restored,
there
may
very
well
have
been
also
a
finding
that
he
should
be
committed
civilly
under
the
burden
of
proof
required
by
addington.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
if...
he
would
not
be
required
to
do
that.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
if
i
were
facing
a
potential
trial
in
a
capital
case,
i
would
be
trying
to
prove
that.
i
don't
know
whether
a
typical
defendant
would
or
not.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
because...
no,
not
under
the
rulings
of
this
court.
i
would
be
civilly
committed
only
so
long
as
there
is
a
continuing
finding
that
i'm
dangerous.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
not
necessarily.
only
if
he's
also
found
to
be
restored
to
competence.
now,
he
could
be
found
to
be
not
dangerous,
still
not
be
competent
to
stand
trial
and
be
released.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
that
is
correct,
and
the
important
aspect--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--yes,
justice
scalia,
and
the
important
fact
is
the
meshing
of
those
two
requirements.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
nor,
justice--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--nor,
justice
souter,
has
there
been
any
indication
that
in
the
15
years
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
required
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard,
that
defendants
who
were
factually
incompetent
have
been
forced
to
stand
trial
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
these
things
obviously,
by
nature
and
by
definition--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--i
cannot
answer
that
historically,
justice
souter,
and
my
experience
as
a
prosecutor
and
attorney
general
only
date
back
to
1982,
so
all
of
my
personal
experience
has
been
under
the
new
statute.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
justice
o'connor,
i...
the
judge's
pronouncement
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
made
that
finding
solely
on
the
basis
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
i
agree
with
you
that
the
cold
reading
of
the
transcript,
absent
the
evidence
of
malingering,
should
have
led
any
trier
of
fact
to
conclude
that
this
defendant
was
incompetent,
and
i
can
only
rectify
the
judge's
finding
with
the
transcript
by
the
conclusion
that
he
also
found
that
this
defendant
was
malingering
and
fabricating
his
symptoms.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
that
is
correct--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--justice
stevens,
but
not
without
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
factually
incompetent.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
that
is
correct,
with
the
other
safeguards
of
the
statute
designed
to
overcome
that
risk
of
error
by
providing
multiple
opportunities
for
the
defendant
to
reraise
the
issue.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
you
have
the
same
multiple
opportunities,
that
is
correct.
you
don't
have
the
opportunity
except
under
oklahoma
statute
to
change
your
forum.
if
you're
dissatisfied
with
the
ruling
of
the
judge
on
incompetency
when
you
raise
it
again
you
can
demand
a
jury
trial,
or
vice
versa,
a
new
jury.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
exactly.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
except
for
my
point
that
the
reason
those
safeguards
are
there
are
to
guarantee
that
the
safeguards
preserve
the
substantive
due
process
rights
of
the
defendant
while
still
protecting
against
the
false
findings
of
incompetence
based
upon
malingering.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
judge...
your
honor,
there
are,
of
course,
studies
about
the
effects
of
malingering,
and
there
is
the
fact
that
it
has
reached
the
stage
where
it
is
a
separate
diagnosis
under
the
diagnostic
and
statistical
manual,
fourth
edition.
i
don't
know--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--it
is
not
classified
as
a
disease,
it
is
classified
as
a
finding.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
with
requisite
elements
to
make
that
finding.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
none
were
presented
in
the
context
of
this
trial
below,
and
i
doubt
if
it
would
be
very
easy
to
get
a
collection
of
jurists
who
were
willing
to
say
that
they
were
in
fact
hoodwinked
by
an
accused
who
was
falsely
claiming
incompetence.
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
context
of
this
case
the
accused
might
have
been
well
advised
to
demand
his
jury
trial
because
the
jury
would
not
have
had
what
the
court
had,
which
was
the
repeated
statements
by
defense
counsel
that
in
their
opinion
the
defendant
was
faking,
and
i
doubt
if
counsel
would
have
made
those
same
statements,
which
they
were
required
in
candor
and
under
disciplinary
rules
to
tell
the
court,
i
doubt
if
they
would
have
made
those
same
statements
to
the
court...
to
the
jury,
had
a
jury
trial
been
demanded.
now,
whether
the
jury
under
those
circumstances
would
still
have
denied
the
finding
of
incompetence
is
pure
speculation.
i
don't
know.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
the
case
law
and
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
are
absolutely
silent
on
this.
the
standards
of
the
american
bar
association
provide
that
there
are
circumstances
in
competency
proceedings
where
counsel
might
not
only
be
a
witness
but
might
be
the
best
witness,
and
i
do
know
as
a
matter
of
practice
that
courts
pay
great
deference,
particularly
in
the
application
stage,
to
a
presentment
by
counsel
that
in
his
opinion
this...
his
client
is
not
competent
to
proceed.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
do
know
that
under
these
aba
standards,
even
if
counsel
becomes
a
witness
as
to
the
manifestations
of
his
client,
he
cannot
be
inquired
as
to
communications
with
his
client
over
his
objection.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
justice
breyer,
i
would
have
to
concede
that
oklahoma
has
not
constructed
a
perfect
system.
i
don't
know
if
any
state
in
the
union
has.
i
will
concede
that
there
will
be
errors.
i
do
not
concede
that
there
have
to
be
errors.
i
do
believe
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
in
a
case
of
actual
incompetence
is
a
standard
that
can
be
met,
and
that
truly
in--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--justice
ginsburg,
i
would
very
much
doubt
if
any
state
could
enact
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
consistent
with
the
fundamental
requirement
of
fairness
and
an
opportunity
for
the
defendant,
if
he's
the
one
presenting
the
cause
of
incompetence,
to
meet
that
burden
of
proof
no
matter...
and
we
have
enacted
a
great
number
of
safeguards
in
the
oklahoma
statute,
but
i
don't
know
if
they
would
be
sufficient
to
require
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
no
state
has
done
that,
except
the
state
of
maryland,
and
they
place
that
burden
on
the
state.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
justice
scalia,
i
do
not
concede
that
innocent
people
are
going
to
go
to
prison.
i--
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
--not
in
those
terms,
justice
ginsburg,
but
there
is
a
fundamental
right,
under
due
process,
not
to
be
tried
while
incompetent.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
i
think,
consistent
with
patterson
v.
new
york,
a
state
has
great
latitude
in
constructing
the
procedures
to
guarantee
that
right.
i
don't
know
if
that
latitude
extends
to
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
w.
a.
edmondson
thank
you.
