justice
breyer
you
know
this
area
of
the
law
better
than
i
do.
is
there...
has
it
been
held
or
decided
about
whether
you
could
have
a
trial
for
a
person
who
was
physically
ill
to
the
point
where
he
couldn't
understand
what
was
going
on,
like
a
coma,
somebody
who's
in
a
coma?
are
there
any...
is
there
case
law
on
that,
about
the
right
to
be
present
and
participate
in
your
trial?
i
mean,
suppose
a
person
were
in
a
coma,
so
he
couldn't
understand.
he
might
recover,
he
might
not.
justice
breyer
if
he
recovered,
you
could
try
him,
if
not,
not.
is
that
right?
justice
breyer
it's
dusky.
justice
breyer
but
i
mean,
is
it
clear
that
a
person
who
is
in
a
coma
cannot
be
brought
to
trial?
justice
breyer
can't
understand
what's
going
on.
justice
breyer
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
psychiatry.
justice
breyer
and
the
law
that
says
that
is,
the
case
that
says
that?
do
you
know,
off-hand?
justice
breyer
and
he
couldn't
assist
the
lawyer,
okay.
justice
breyer
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
possibly
that
this...
well,
i'll
ask
your
opponent.
i
mean,
the
question
here
i
would
think
is
whether
he
is
competent.
whether
he
is
physically
incompetent
or
mentally
incompetent,
or
whatever,
it's
a
competency
question.
justice
breyer
all
right.
justice
breyer
can
i
ask
you
to
get...
because
it's
right
on
the
merits,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
you
do
address
what
i
take
it
to
be
their,
in
my
mind
strong
argument...
or
the
strongest
argument
they
make,
in
my
mind,
is,
one
is
the
history
is
against
you,
but
the
other
thing
they
say
is,
leaving
the
history
aside,
imagine
you
had
a
certain
number
of
people
who
are
in
comas,
and
some
of
them
are
faking,
and
some
of
them
are
not.
if
you're
really
in
a
coma,
you
can't
get
a
fair
trial.
if
you're
faking,
you
can't,
all
right.
now,
they
say
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
test,
you
will
undoubtedly
make
some
mistakes,
and
there
will
be
some
people
in
jail
or
dead,
because
you
executed
them,
who
were
in
comas.
you
made
a
mistake.
but
for
every
one
of
those
there's
a
mistake
the
other
way,
so
you're
doing
the
best
you
can.
then
they
say,
you
change
that,
you
change
everything.
suddenly,
you
have
maybe
eight
people
who
were
executed
or
in
jail
who
really
were
not
faking,
they
were
in
comas,
for
every
one
you
let
outside,
so
this
thing
that's
very
harmful
to
the
system
at
the
same
time
you
don't
have
much
justification
for
it,
because
after
all,
when
you
do
make
a
mistake,
and
you
wrongly
let
somebody
out
who,
you
know,
who
wasn't
in
a
coma,
he
was
a
faker,
you
put
him
in
the
mental
hospital
anyway,
he's
more
likely
to
get
tried
because
he
can't
fake
the
coma
forever,
and
so
there
isn't
much
harm
to
the
state
from
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
at
the
same
time,
there's
quite
a
lot
of
harm
to
the
fairness
of
the
system
the
other
way.
all
right.
now,
i'm
just
restating
what
i
take
to
be
their
argument
because
i
want
to
be
certain
that
you
respond
to
that.
justice
breyer
i
use
the
coma
because
i
want
to
get
away
from
the
all
kinds
of
other
issues
of
the
earlier
insanity
defense,
et
cetera,
but
you
can
respond
in
terms
of
the
insanity.
justice
breyer
i
just
did
that
for
illustration.
justice
breyer
he
says
there
are
a
lot
of
good
things.
he
says
that
ultimately,
if
you
apply
this
standard
of
proof,
the
only
difference
between
that
and
what,
48,
or
46
states
do,
the
preponderance,
is
that
a
very
large
number,
a
significant
number
of
not...
of
people
who
weren't
faking
will
be
in
prison,
and
that's
a
big
harm
to
the
system,
and
the
need
for
that
in
oklahoma
is
very
small...
not
nonexistent,
but
small,
because
the
other
people,
the
people
that
you
wrongly
got
off
the
trial
who
were
faking,
you
put
them
in
the
mental
hospital
anyway
for
the
most
part,
or
they
recover
and
you
try
them
later.
now,
that's...
he's
saying
the
harm
to
the
system
of
fundamental
fairness
is
great,
the
benefit
to
the
system
of
your
rule
is
small,
and
you
have
the
history
against
you.
that
says,
i
took
his
argument.
i
mean,
i
took
that
to
be
the
argument,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
you,
you
know,
respond
to
it.
justice
breyer
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
say
in
response
to
what
i've
raised
before,
which
i
take
it
as
being
that
he's
saying
under
your
test
the
only
difference
is
that
there
will
be
five
people
in
prison
or
executed
who
absolutely
were
the
same
as
if
they
were
in
a
coma
for
every
one
who
is
a
faker
who
you
caught
by
this
test,
and
you
don't
need
the
test
to
catch
the
fakers,
because
the
fakers
are
going
to
be
put
in
mental
hospitals
anyway.
now,
i
know
i
raised
that
before,
but
i
just
wanted
to
be...
you
then
went
off
on
a
number
of
other
things,
and
i
wanted
to
see
if
you--
