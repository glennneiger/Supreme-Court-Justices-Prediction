mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
detailed
statutory
priorities
that
congress
has
enacted
to
govern
the
payment
of
claims
in
bankruptcy
cases.
section
503(b)(1)(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that
postpetition
tax
penalty
claims
are
to
be
treated
as
administrative
expenses
of
the
debtor's
estate
with
a
first
priority
in
payment.
the
statute
codifies
this
court's
1966
decision
in
nicholas
v.
united
states,
which
reached
precisely
the
same
conclusion
under
prior
law.
in
this
case,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
it
did
not
see
the
fairness
or
the
justice
of
the
first
priority
for
postpetition
tax
penalty
claims.
the
court
stated
that
it
would
be
more
fair
and
more
just
for
general
commercial
creditors
to
be
paid
in
advance
of
tax
petition
claims
and
therefore
reverse
the
statutory
priorities,
changing
the
priority
for
postpetition
tax
penalty
claims
from
first
to
last.
the
court
stated
that
its
restructuring
of
the
statutory
priorities
was
justified
by
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
that
congress
codified
in
1978
as
section
510(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
but
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
do
not
confer
such
a
broad
power
of
statutory
nullification
on
bankruptcy
courts.
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
were
designed
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
individual
misconduct
of
a
creditor
in
acquiring
or
pursuing
his
claim.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
comstock
case,
the
doctrine
deprives
the
wrongdoer
of
the
fruits
of
his
wrong.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
courts
have
consistently
held
that
in
the
absence
of
creditor
misconduct,
courts
were
not
permitted
under
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
to
simply
disregard
a
statutory
priority
that
they
disagreed
with.
they
were
not
permitted
to
say,
as
the
court
said
in
this
case,
that
the
statutory
priority
is
a
mistake
and
will
not
be
enforced.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
in
this
case
that
under
the
traditional
judge
made
principles
of
equitable
subordination,
that
doctrine
served
the
limited
function
of
providing
a
guarantee
against
creditor
misconduct,
but
the
court
reasoned
that
when
congress
codified
these
principles
in
1978,
congress
somehow
radically
altered
the
scope
of
the
doctrine,
and
that
it
is
now
appropriate
for
the
court
to
disregard
a
statutory
priority
when
the
court
concludes
that
it
is
just
to
do
so.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
agree
that
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
can
apply
to
all
claims.
our
understanding
of
those
principles
and
the
understanding
that
this
court
stated
in
the
comstock
case
and
that
all
other
courts
had
stated
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code
was
that
what
those
principles
did
was
to
prevent
a
creditor
from
acquiring
or
pursuing
a
claim
based
upon
misconduct.
the
legislative
history
of
the
bankruptcy
code
states,
but
we
think
it
is
obvious,
that
these
principles
of
equitable
subordination
would
rarely
apply
to
a
tax
claim,
but
if--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
is
correct.
that
is
what
the
doctrine
is
designed--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
theory,
it
could.
again,
i
think
it
would
be
rare
that
we
could
think
of
a
situation
where
that
would
happen,
and
the
senate
report
on
this
bill
made
that
very
point,
but
certainly,
if
the
united
states
acquired
a
claim
through
misconduct,
it
would
be
subject
to
equitable
subordination.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
let
me...
that
is...
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
what
you're
referring
to,
which
is
a
fragment
of
a
single
sentence
of
the
floor
statements
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill,
but
let's
consider
that
statement
in
its
context.
the
sponsors
made
several
points.
first,
they
pointed
out
that
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
that
were
being
codified
were
those
expressed
in
existing
case
law,
and
certainly
that
represents
an
intent
to
incorporate,
not
to
significantly
alter
the
preexisting
doctrine.
second,
the
sponsors
stated
that
under
existing
case
law,
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
served
as
a
remedy
for
creditor
misconduct
much
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
had
said
in
the
comstock
case.
now,
the
third
thing
they
said,
and
this
is
the
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on,
was
that
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
would
also
permit
subordination
of
a
claim
of
a
status
susceptible
to
subordination
such
as
a
penalty.
that
statement
was
not
a
correct
description
of
existing
case
law.
there
was
literally
no
case
law
of
that
type
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and,
indeed,
as
i
have
already
mentioned,
in
1966
in
the
nicholas
case
this
court
held
that
postpetition
tax
penalty
claims
were
entitled
to
a
first
priority
in
bankruptcy.
the
senate
report
does
not
contain
the
misstatement
that
is
in
this
fragment
of
the
sentence
from
the
floor
statements.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
certainly
agree
that
when
congress
codified
these
principles
it
intended
for
the
courts
to
continue
developing
them,
and
it
is
appropriate
for
the
courts
to
continue
devising
rules
that
guard
against
creditor
misconduct
and
that
deprive
the
wrongdoer
of
the
fruits
of
its
wrong,
but
nothing
in
those
ordinary,
equitable
principles
provide
any
support
for
the
novel
contention
that
a
court
in
equity
can
simply
disregard
a
statute
that
it
disagrees
with.
as
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
the
stebbins
case,
neither
general
equitable
principles
nor
the
specific
principles
of
equitable
subordination
authorize
a
court
to
simply
say
a
statutory
priority
is
a
mistake
and
will
not
be
enforced,
and
that
is
in
essence
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
my
understanding,
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
in
both
statements
what
they
say
is
that
this
is
what
existing
case
law
does.
our
point
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
read
in
its
entirety,
which,
of
course,
if
we're
going
to
read
the
legislative
history
we
have
to
do
that,
read
in
its
entirety,
what
the
history
manifests
is
an
intent
to
incorporate
existing
case
law
and
then
a
misdescription
of
one
aspect
of
that
case
law.
the
intent
to
incorporate
existing
case
law
is
manifest
in
the
senate
report
which
doesn't
contain
the
misdescription
of
the
existing
case
law,
but
beyond
the
question
of
intent
and
description
is
just
the
simple
logic
of
the
situation.
it
is
improbable
that
congress
intended,
by
adopting
such
a
broad
concept
of
equitable
subordination,
to
have
rendered
all
of
its
substantive
statutory
priorities
essentially
meaningless,
which
is
a
construction
that
would
result
from
the
opinion
in
this
case,
and
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
situation
that
would
exist
with
respect
to
private
creditors
is
a
situation
where
the
claim
was
obtained
by
fraud
or
by
ruse,
or
was
obtained
through
some
unfair
manipulation
of
the
bankruptcy
process.
it's
hard
for
me,
as
it
is
for
you,
justice
ginsburg,
to
put
a
concrete
concept
to
apply
those
rules
in
a
concrete
way
to
tax
collection.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
certainly
believe
that
there
are
situations
that
could
occur,
and
i'm
obviously
not
here
to
try
to
anticipate
all
of
them.
i
will
agree
with
you
that
if
there
was
a
situation
where
an
authorized
representative
of
the
united
states
had
taken
some
action
that
was
unfair
to
other
creditors
in
achieving
a
preference
for
a
government
claim
that
wouldn't
otherwise
have
been
factually
appropriate,
that
would
be
the
kind
of
context
in
which
equitable
subordination
might
apply.
i
think
actually
equitable
subordination
is
a
broad
doctrine
when
it
applies.
it
broadly
is
designed
to
prevent
misconduct
in
any
of
its
manners
of
manifestation,
and
we
don't
intend
to
suggest
that
it
doesn't
have
this
broad
objective,
but
we
think
it
reasonably
clear
it
doesn't
have
the
broad
objective
of
making
the
statutory
priorities
essentially
meaningless.
it
is
obvious,
we
think,
that
if
the
only
effective
priority
rule
in
bankruptcy
cases
turned
on
a
concept
as
elastic
as
fairness,
that
extraordinary
uncertainty
would
exist
for
all
creditors.
for
example,
on
grounds
of
fairness
should
a
tort
claim
for
pain
and
suffering
be
subordinated
on
a
rationale
applied
in
this
case
that
it's
not
a
pecuniary
loss
resulting
from
an
extension
of
credit.
what
do
we
make
of
the
fifth
priority
for
claims
based
upon
stored
grain?
is
that
more
fair
than
the
new
seventh
priority
for
alimony
and
child
support?
now,
these
kinds
of
categorical
determinations
are
exactly
what
congress
does
when
it
enacts
these
statutory
priorities.
with
respect
to
tax
penalty
claims
alone,
congress
has
four
separate
rules.
postpetition
tax
penalty
claims
are
given
a
first
priority,
some
types
of
prepetition
tax
penalty
claims
have
a
seventh
priority,
other
types
of
prepetition
tax
penalty
claims
are
treated
as
general
unsecured
claims
in
a
chapter
11
and
are
subordinated
to
general
unsecured
claims
in
a
chapter
7.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no...
well,
there
has
been
a
recent
set
of
cases
that
have
said
equitable
subordination
doesn't
require
proof
of
creditor
misconduct.
there
has
been
a
long,
much
more
substantial
history
of
cases
that
says
that
it
do,
and
the
cases...
that
it
does
require
creditor
misconduct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
since
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
i
believe
that
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
this
issue
have
agreed
with
the
proposition
that
we
don't
agree
with,
and
that
proposition
is
that
this
fragment
in
the
senate...
in
the
floor
statement
changed
the
law
when
congress
said
they
were
intending
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
concurring
opinion
i
don't
think
ultimately
reached
the
question
that
we're
reaching
here.
the
concurring
opinion
concluded
that
principles
of
equitable
subordination
can
apply
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
did
apply,
but
i
mean...
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
point
of
the...
you
and
i
might
draw
different
understandings
of
the
concurring
opinion.
my
understanding
was
that
the
concurring
opinion
was
satisfied
that
equitable
subordination
applied.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--she
joined
the
judgment,
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
didn't
understand
that
she
specifically
discussed
the
question
of
how
it
applied,
she
was--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--addressing
the
question
of
whether
it
applied.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
court
perceived...
no,
she...
i
didn't
mean
to
say
she
agreed
with
us.
i
said,
i
don't
think
she
specifically
reached
the
question
of
how
it
applied.
the
government
addressed
two
contentions
in
the
courts
below,
at
least
as
reading
the
majority
opinion
you
would
think
they
did.
the
two
contentions
that
the
majority
opinion
addressed
were
that
equitable
subordination
simply
cannot
apply
to
a
priority
claim,
and
i
think...
and,
of
course,
we
don't
take
that
position.
we
agree
it
can.
it's
just
a
question
of
how
it
applies,
and
my
understanding
of
the
concurring
opinion
was
that
she
was
addressing
the
question
of
can
it
apply
and
didn't
specifically
discuss
how
it
applied.
now,
that
was
my
reading
of
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
she
certainly
didn't
disagree
with
anything
that
the
panel--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
stevens,
i
don't
mean
to
be
arguing
with
you
or
quibbling
with
you,
i
just
had
a
slightly
different
perception
of
what
point
she
was
addressing.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
those
principles--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
is
a
precise
statement
not
only
of
our
position
but
of
this
court's
position
in
the
comstock
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
you
have
the
timing
and
the
courts
wrong
in
your
description
of
those
two
cases.
the
comstock
case
was
a
decision
by
this
court--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
it
held
that
the
doctrine
is
designed
to
deprive
the
wrongdoer
of
the
fruits
of
his
wrong,
and
that
every
case
prior
to
the
bankruptcy
code
held
the
same
thing,
except
there
was
a
second
circuit
decision
that
you
were
referring
to
involving
the
subordination
of
a
shareholder's
claim
against
the
corporation.
now,
that
second
circuit
decision
in
our
view
has
both...
was
a
correct
result,
and
contained
some
incorrect
reasoning.
it
was
a
correct
result
because
what
the
court
concluded
was
that
these
shareholder
claims
were
brought
as
shareholders,
and
that
a
claim
of
a
shareholder
brought
as
a
shareholder
is
subordinated
by
statute.
it's
subordinated
by
the
long
tradition
of
making
shareholder
interests
at
the
bottom
of
the
heap.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir,
brought
in
their
capacity
as
a
shareholder
is
a
shareholder
interest
which
is
the
last
to
be
paid.
now,
there
was
some
reasoning
in
that
case
which...
i'm
trying
to
remember
the
name
of
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir,
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--stirling
homex
is
the
case
we're
talking
about.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
reasoning
in
stirling
homex--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
was
manifestly
incorrect
is,
you
will
notice
toward
the
end
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
that
case
they
relied
on
a
bill
that
had
been
past
the
house.
the
bill
that
had
been
past
the
house
said
the
claims
could
be
subordinated
on
any
equitable
grounds,
a
much
broader
concept
than
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination.
the
court
in
stirling
homex
said,
this
is
good
reasoning,
this
is
the
reasoning
we're
applying,
but
congress,
when
it
got
around
to
passing
the
bankruptcy
code
rejected
the
house
bill,
adopted
the
senate
bill.
the
senate
bill
says
that
only
principles
of
equitable
subordination
can
be
used
to...
not
just...
to
justify
subordination,
and
the
senate
report
in
describing
its
bill
accurately
describes
the
existing
case
law
that
was
being
incorporated
as
cases
that
remedy
creditor
misconduct,
so
we
believe
that
creditor
misconduct
is,
indeed,
what
congress--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
breyer,
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
breyer,
we
agree
completely
that
what
the
courts
are
disposed
to
continue
to
develop
are
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination,
and
we
don't
think
that
developing
them
would
be
to
take
a
doctrine
that
all
understand
at
the
time
of
its
incorporation
into
the
code
was
based
solely
on
creditor
misconduct
and
specifically
did
not
permit
courts
to
disregard
priorities
it
agreed
with,
and
then,
quote,
develop
this
doctrine
into
a
polar
opposite,
which
is
what
we've
ended
up
with
in
the
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
scalia,
they
said
that
pre...
well,
i'll
accept
that
terminology
didn't
exist,
but
actually
what
had
happened
were
the
decisions
of
this
court,
three
decisions
of
this
court.
in,
i
believe,
san...
san
something
versus
granquist...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
trying
to
remember
a
lot,
and
i'm
not
doing
a
good
job.
simonson
v.
granquist,
the
court
had
said
that
the
bankruptcy
act
did
not
allow
penalty
claims,
and
the
court
in
this
case
read
that
for
everything
it
was
worth,
but
it
didn't
really
stand
for
that,
because
both
before
and
after
simonson
v.
granquist
this
court
had
held
in
the
nicholas
case,
in
the
boteler
case
that
postpetition
tax
penalty
claims
were
allowed
and
were
entitled
to
first
priority.
now,
that
is
our...
that
is
really
the
essence
of
our
point
here.
the
court
of
appeals
misunderstood
the
history
of
tax
penalty
claims,
it
misunderstood
the
history
of
equitable
subordination,
and
i
am
reminded,
justice
scalia,
that
i
misspoke
earlier
when
you
asked
me
whether
other
courts
had...
whether,
after
the
bankruptcy
code
all
courts
had
taken
this
perspective.
i
am
reminded
of
two
situations
where
that
didn't
occur,
the
mansfield
tire
case,
which
really
relates
to
the
second
case
we're
going
to
be
arguing,
the
courts
said
that
a
penalty
claim...
rather,
that
a
statutory
priority
claim
could
not
be
subordinated
on
grounds
of
fairness,
and
also
judge
alito's
concurring
opinion
in,
i
believe,
the
burden
case
i
think
is
a
very
accurate
description
of
what
congress
was
about
in
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code
and
the
fact
that,
to
take
the
perspective
that
creditor
misconduct
is
not
what
equitable
subordination
is
about
is
really
to
say
that
all
the
other
substantive
priorities
in
the
bankruptcy
code
don't
have
any
meaning,
that
congress
did
a
meaningless
act
in
writing
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
code.
if
the
only
effective
rule
is
fairness,
then
we
don't
have
an
effective
rule.
in
our
view,
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--were
not
allowed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
weren't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--number
1.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
here,
it's
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--as
i
will
discuss
in
the
next
case
to
be
argued,
we
think
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
are
the
same
in
both
contexts.
we
think--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--oh--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
didn't
jump
prepetition
tax
penalty
claims
from
bottom
to
number
1.
number
1
is
just
postpetition
tax
penalty
claims.
prepetition
tax
penalty
claims
were,
as
you
say,
jumped
only
to
seventh
priority
or
to
general
unsecured
in
11,
and
in
a
7,
they're
still
subordinated.
congress
has
gone
to
great
pains
to
give
us
a
very
detailed,
highly
articulated
set
of
statutory
priorities.
congress
did
not
undermine
its...
all
of
its
work
by
allowing
courts
to
then
say,
well,
let's
just
do
what's
fair.
we
believe
that
principles
of
equitable
subordination
that
were
incorporated
into
the
bankruptcy
code
are
designed
as
a
remedy
for
creditor
misconduct.
it
is
unquestioned
that
the
claim
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
innocent,
was
not
based
on
misconduct,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
erred
in
subordinating
the
claim
that
congress
gave
the
first
priority
to.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
a
choice
in
the
sense
that
each
are
liable
separately,
but
when
either
pays,
it
reduces
the
liability
of
the
others.
i
mean,
we
can't
collect...
they
are
separate
liabilities
under
the
code,
but
administratively
they're
set
off
against
each
other,
but
let
me--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--congress
has
dealt
with
that
specifically.
i
mean,
you're
assuming
a
situation
where
the
employee...
where
the
officer
is
in
bankruptcy,
is
that
correct?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
frankly
don't
know
whether
the
officer...
what
the
nature
of
the
officer's
claim
against
the
corporation
would
be.
it
would
be
some
kind
of
common
law
indemnity
claim,
i
assume.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
penalty
that's
been
discussed,
the
responsible
officer
penalty,
only
applies
in
narrow...
in
particular
situations.
it
only
applies
where
the
officer
is
responsible
for
the
withholding
and
paying
over
of
a
specific
tax.
it
applies
to
trust
fund
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
for
the
tax
penalty.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
certainly
for
the...
yes,
that's
correct.
for
the
late
payment
penalty?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
for
the
late
payment
or
the
underpayment
penalties--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--only
the
corporation
would
be
liable
for
those
penalties.
the
liability
under
6672
is
for
a
failure
to
turn
over
a
tax
that's
been
collected,
and
it's
only
trust
fund
taxes.
it's
not...
it
doesn't
generally
apply
to
all
different
kinds
of
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
this
court
addressed,
of
course,
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
fair
result
in
the
nicholas
case,
and
the
court
said
that
the
first
priority
for
postpetition
tax
penalties
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
debtors
abide
by
the
same
rules
that
all
other
people
conducting
business
abide
by.
the
priority,
if
you
will,
is
fair
in
this
broad
legislative
sense,
because
it
deprives
the
debtor
of
an
unfair
advantage
vis
a
vis
everybody
else
who's
out
there
conducting
business.
the
contention
that
it's
unfair
to
specific
creditors
in
this
bankruptcy
case
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
they
think
the
congress
made
a
mistake,
that
it's
not
a
good
idea
to
have
this
priority.
we
think
that
when
congress
goes
to
the
trouble
of
drafting
these
priorities,
they
do
it
for
a
reason.
the
reason
is
because
they
think
this
is
a
good
idea
in
a
general,
abstract
way.
we
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
permits
courts
to
reassess
those
general
fairness
questions.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
may--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
heard
you
ask
that
question,
and
even
hearing
you
describe
it
again
i'm
not
100
percent
sure
i
understand
the
question,
but
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
the
answer
is
as
i
understand
it.
if
you're
in--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
you're
in
a
chapter
11--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
the
question
is,
can
you
get
unanimity,
and
the
answer
is
no,
but
is
there
some
way
to
cram
it
down?
1129(a)(7)
specifies
that
if
you
want
to
cram
it
down
on
the
nonconsenting
creditors
you've
got
to
give
them
the
same
treatment
they'd
get
in
a
7,
and
so
in
a
7,
under
726(a)(1),
the
first
priority
of
this
postpetition
tax
penalty
claim
is
recognized.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
an
11,
the
court
has
to
recognize
it,
too.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
but
you
can't
do
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
don't
have
that
power
in
a
7,
because
in
a
7
we're
talking
about
postpetition
tax
penalties.
postpetition
tax
penalties
in
a
7
are
a
first
priority.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
they
could
be
equitably
subordinated,
i
agree.
if
you
could
ignore
a
priority
by
subordinating
it,
you
can
always
advance
the
interests
of
other
creditors,
and
so
if
that's
your
question,
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--thank
you.
