mr.
jones,
do
you
agree
that
a
tax
penalty
claim
in
theory
could
be
subordinated
if
there
were
some
sufficient
reason
for
finding
fault
with
the
government...
misconduct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
i
took
your
position
basically
to
be
that
in
a
particular
case,
no
equitable
subordination
absent
a
showing
of
inequitable
conduct.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
theory
the
government
could
engage
in
such
conduct.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
pikna,
it
does
appear
that
the
members
of
congress
had
in
mind
the
requirement
of
misconduct
as
a
principle
of
equitable
subordination,
doesn't
it?
