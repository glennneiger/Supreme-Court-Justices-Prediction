mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
chapter
7
case.
it
is
critical
to
remember
that
fact,
because
section
726
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
controls
the
order
of
distribution
in
chapter
7
cases,
in
order
to
assure
the
equality
to
all
creditors
begins
with
the
clause,
except
as
provided
in
section
510
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
what
the
government
seeks
to
do
is
to
effectively
eliminate
that
section.
it
also
seeks
to
eliminate
the
distinction
between
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalties,
which
are
the
types
of
penalties
which
we
have
in
this
case,
from
pecuniary
loss
tax
penalty
claims.
the
difference
is
critical.
in
a
prepetition
context,
for
example,
section
726(a)(4)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
expressly
subordinates
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalty
claims
to
the
claims
of
general
unsecured
creditors.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
a
plan
that
was
confirmed.
the
vast
majority
of
the
penalties
in
issue
arose
very
near
the
time
of
confirmation.
there
was
no
time
for
anybody
to
respond
to
determine...
for
the
creditors
to
react
and
say,
gee,
we
ought
to
stop
this.
when
the
case
converted,
the
tax
was
owed,
the
penalties
were
owed,
but
these
are
not
for
financial
loss.
these
are
penalties
that
are
punitive,
or
to
deter,
and
as
the
court
stated
unanimously
in
simonson
v.
granquist,
the
majority
of
the
court
stated
that
the
purpose
of
penalties
is
to
punish,
and
the
burden
would
fall
on
the
innocent
creditors
in
the
case.
the
dissent
agreed
with
that
proposition,
that
the
punitive
aspect
of
penalties
was
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and
the
equality
of
distribution
which
was
contemplated.
the
bankruptcy
code
also
distinguishes
between
nonpecuniary
and
pecuniary
loss
penalties
in
section
507(a),
now
(8),
formerly
(7),
which
deals
with
the
priority
to
be
accorded
to
prepetition
tax
penalties.
in
the
context
of
section
503(b)(1)(c),
where
the
court...
where
the
statute
refers
to
penalties,
it
does
not
draw
that
fine
line
distinction,
because
congress
did
not
have
to.
by
section
726,
they
expressly
made
510
applicable
to
those
penalties
and
stated
that
they
may
be
subordinated
under
section
510.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
categorical
rewriting
of
the
statute.
this
is
merely
looking
at
individual
elements
to
be
applied
with
the
test
of--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
we're
merely
saying
that
in
order
to
evaluate
equitable
subordination,
one
of
the
elements
which
a
test
may
consider
is
the
nature
of
the
claim.
in
this
particular
case,
a
nonpecuniary
loss--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
if
we
were
to
take
the
position
that
congress,
by
establishing
categories,
determines
definitively
the
priority
to
be
accorded,
then
congress
has
stated
that
general
unsecured
claims
are
to
be
paid
in
order
of
distribution
under
726.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
if
the
court
ruling
were
that
all
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalty
claims
are
automatically
subordinated
without
more,
we
would
agree
that
there
is
a
new--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
it
is
a
category,
if
the
court
seeks
to
call
it
that,
in
the
same
sense
that
claims
that
were
arising
through
misconduct
are
categories.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
the
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalties
we
agree
are
fundamentally
different
from
pecuniary
loss
tax
penalty
claims,
and
we
believe
that
in
the
context
of
administrative
expense
claims
congress
chose
not
to
expressly
draw
the
distinction
because
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
are
filed
are
not
just
chapter
11
cases.
chapter
11
cases
comprise
approximately
1-1/2
to
2
percent
of
all
the
bankruptcy
filings
in
the
country.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
much
broader
statute
which
would
permit
the
courts
to--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
i
don't
recall
which
case
specifically,
but
that
would
permit...
that
would
eliminate
the
statute
at
that
point.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
it
is
an
example
of
one
part
of
the
test
of
the
elements
of
equitable
subordination
that
we
believe
it
is
appropriate
for
courts
to
consider,
and
the
reason...
the
courts
have
already
recognized
that
penalties
by
their
very
nature
are
punitive.
they
are
intended
to
punish
or
deter.
here,
the
burden
of
the
punishment
falls
not
on
the
wrongdoer,
the
debtor
in
this
case,
it
falls
on
the
creditors,
because
in
order
to...
what
you
are
doing
is,
you're
taking
financial
loss,
you're
taking
funds
from
the
parties
that
would
normally
share
due
to
their
financial
loss.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
urging
that
position.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
if,
for
instance,
the
postpetition
claims
in
a
case
are
$1
million,
all
of
the
postpetition
claims,
and
the
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalty
claims
are
perhaps
$10,000,
a
very
small
portion,
and
if
there
is
a
small
amount
of
funds
to
distribute,
perhaps
$100,000
in
the
case,
the
impact
of
the
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalties
relative
to
the
other
claims
that
are
recognized
is
de
minimis,
and
that
is
the
concept
that
was
in
part
adopted
by
the
majority
in
nicholas
v.
united
states.
that
was
a
very
narrow
5-4
decision--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--those
are
some
of
the
factors,
your
honor.
those
are
not
the
exclusive
factors.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
equitable
subordination
by
its
nature
requires
that
the
court
exercise
its
discretion,
and
if
one
court
views
the
discretion
to
be
applied
in
a
different
manner
than
another
court,
it's
possible
that
the
same
fact
pattern
could
result
in
two
different
outcomes.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
it's
possible,
but
it's
unlikely,
your
honor,
and
we
do
not
believe
it
is
likely
because
we
believe
that
the
courts
of
appeal
will
establish
standards
as
they
have
generally,
and
the
courts
of
appeal
are
uniform
in
their
position
that
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalty
claims
do
not
require
misconduct
as
a
necessary
element
in
order
to
reach
the
subordination
question.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
not
totally,
your
honor.
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--in
a
reorganization
context,
if
the
company
is
in
chapter
11
and
operating,
there
may
not
be
a
reason
to
subordinate
penalties
even
though
they
are
punitive
by
nature.
the
distinction
here
is
that
we
are
in
a
chapter
7
case,
and
that
we
are
in
liquidating
chapter
7
case.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
if
there's
not
enough
to
go
around
the
creditors
would
have
to
vote
for
the
plan.
a
company
could
still
survive.
it
does
not
require,
if
there's
not
enough
money
to
go
around,
that
the
company
automatically
liquidate,
although
that
is
likely
to
follow.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
an
environmental
fine
may
be
an
example
of
such
a
fine
or
penalty.
a
reason
for
that
is
that
this...
as
this
court
exemplified
through
its
ruling
in
the
mid
atlantic
case,
the
environmental
claims
are
of
a
different
nature,
and
they
are
very
important
to
the
policy
to
promote
avoiding
harm
or
damage
to
the
environment.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
it
does
that
through
reviewing
other
decisions
of
higher
courts
and
through
the
policy
expressed
through
the
congress
through
its
enactments,
through
the
statutes,
and
through
the
legislative
history
they
can
review.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
the
bankruptcy
court
has
to
consider
all
of
the
claims,
not
just
the
federal
claims.
for
instance,
in
this
case
there
are
also
a
number
of
state
tax
law
claims,
there
are
workers
compensation
claims,
there
are
highway
use
tax
claims
that
are
other
federal
tax
claims--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
we
believe
that--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
i
use--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--i
understand.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
we
express
that
as
an
example.
however,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
tax
penalty
claim
for
this
type
of
tax,
the
trust
fund
taxes,
these
are
the
types
of
taxes
that
give
rise
to
the
responsible
officer
liability.
if
the
tax
penalty
claim
is
that
important,
then
if
the
debtor
does
not
pay
it,
that
tax
penalty
should
pass
through
and
be
transferred
to
the
responsible
officer.
that
is
the
party
to
be
deterred.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
the
subordination
provisions
are
applicable
in
all
chapters.
the
amount,
the
degree
of
subordination
varies
based
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
now,
in
the
context
of
a
chapter
7
case,
we
believe
that
the
policy
of
equitable...
of
equal
distribution,
excuse
me,
is
critical,
and
the
court
looks
to
what
is
to
be
accomplished.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
it
will
also
vary
on
the
nature
of
the
debtor
and
who
bears
the
penalty.
what
we
are
expressing
is
that
the
penalties
are
subordinated
not
because
they're
just
nonpecuniary
loss,
but
in
this
particular
context
it
is
a
corporate
debtor,
it
is
a
debtor
in
chapter
7,
and
there
are
insufficient
funds
to
go
around.
now,
the
degree
of
subordination
that
the
bankruptcy
court
stated
subordinate
to
general
unsecured
claims,
if
that
is
error
would
be
harmless
error.
the
court
could
have
said,
just
subordinate
the
nonpecuniary
loss
penalty
to
other
administrative
expense
pecuniary
loss
claims,
so
there
is
a
degree,
a
range
of
discretion
that
can
be
exercised
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
creditor
body
may
be
comprised
primarily
of
shareholders
who
made
loans
to
the
corporation
and
who
are
also
in
control,
and
that
might
be
another
context
where
the
court
would
feel
that
it
is
not
appropriate
to
subordinate,
but
the
court
starts
with
the
position
that
the
claim
has
priority.
it
is
up
to
the
moving
party
to
establish
that
it
is
entitled
to
subordination.
perhaps
the
correct
remedy
here
would
have
been
for
the
internal
revenue
service
to
have
asked
for
the
tax
to
be
subordinated,
because
the
responsible
officers
under
section
6672
of
the
internal
revenue
code
are
responsible
for
the
tax
and
interest,
but
it
does
not
state
that
they're
responsible
for
the
penalties.
so
there's
no
deterrent
effect
on
section
6672
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
is
really
what
this
particular
case
and
these
particular
taxes
are
about,
for
the
officers
to
not
go
ahead
and
not
pay
the
taxes.
what
do
they
care?
they
don't
have
to
pay
it.
it's
the
creditors,
the
innocent
creditors
who
are
giving
value
to
the
debtor,
who
are
trying
to
assist
the
corporation
in
reorganizing,
who
find
out
after
the
debtor
fails
to
pay
taxes
that
they
are
now
also
being
hit
with
this
large
penalty,
a
penalty
for
which
the
internal
revenue
service
gave
nothing,
but
which
the
statute
says,
debtor,
if
you
do
something
wrong,
you
will
be
punished.
the
taxpayer
is
the
party
to
be
punished,
but
in
this
particular
case
it
is
not
the
taxpayer
that
bears
the
burden
of
that
punishment,
it
is
the
innocent
creditors,
the
same
creditors
which
this
court
recognized
in
simonson
v.
granquist,
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
recognized.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
no,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
a
fine
may,
but
503
applies
to
not
just
liquidation
cases,
it
applies
to
chapter
9,
chapter
13,
chapter
11,
chapter
12,
all
cases
in
which
the
debtor
operates.
in
this
particular
context,
we
have
a
very
narrow
category
of
cases.
we
have
a
very
small
number
of
cases--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--that's
true,
your
honor.
the
key
word--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--there
is
operating,
and
when
it's
operating,
it
should
be
punished
for
what
it
is
doing
wrong.
it
still
exists.
it
is
there
to
punish.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
it's
being
taken
away,
we
recognize
that,
but
we
believe
that
there
is
certainly
a
vital
distinction
in
the
liquidation
context,
and
the--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--that's
not
totally
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
when
the
company
is
operating,
it
will
pay
taxes
on
a
regular
basis,
and
section
503(b)(1)
recognizes
that
the
taxes--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
we
are
in
the
sense
that
you
can
only
pay
during
the
operation
costs
and
expenses
incurred
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
and
that's
what
503(b)
states.
it
deals
with
administrative
expenses,
and
there
are
certain
types
that
you
can
pay
in
the
ordinary
course,
and
other
types
that
you
have
to
ask
the
court
for
the
authority
to
pay.
for
instance,
if
you
are
going
to
be
leasing
property,
you
have
to
go
to
the
court
to
expect
to
assume
the
lease
if
you
intend
to
keep
it,
and
then
once
it
is
assumed
you
can
pay
that
rent
in
the
ordinary
course.
part
of
the
assumption
process
requires
also
that
you
bring
current
lease
payments
which
normally
would
be
a
prepetition
claim,
which
would
be
paid
with
general
unsecured
creditors.
there's
a
different
category
of
claim
that
there
the
congress
has
said
you
have
to
bring
these
things
current
and
place
them
together.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
a
liquidation
context,
which
is
something
that
congress
contemplated
when
it
started
off
section
726
of
the
distributive
provisions
and
stated,
except
as
provided
in
510.
yes,
section
726
certainly
recognizes
the
priority
to
be
accorded
to
administrative
expense
claims
generally.
that's
a
given.
the
next
thing,
though,
is
that
it
also
expressly
provided
that
there
may
be
situations
under
section
510
that
it
is
appropriate
to
equitably
subordinate.
the
body
of
law
that
existed
at
the
time
the
bankruptcy
code
was
enacted
focused
on
pecuniary
loss
penalty
claims.
the
trilogy
of
cases
in
this
court,
taylor
v.
standard
gas
and
electric
company,
pepper
v.
litton,
and
the
comstock
case,
each
dealt
with
pecuniary
losses
in
the
context
of
parties--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
the
factor
that
was
emphasized
by
the
court
was
misconduct
in
a...
in
terms
of
trying
to
promote
its
claim
for
financial
loss
ahead
of
other
claims
for
financial
loss,
but
from
that
there
was
a
silence
on
nonpecuniary
loss
claims.
that
issue
was
not
addressed
in
any
of
those
cases,
and
that's
why
this
court
at
this
time
is
writing
on
a
blank
slate.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
particular
concept
was
addressed,
other
than,
in
pepper
v.
litton
the
court
recognized
the
broad
equitable
powers
of
bankruptcy
courts
to
adjust
the
debtor
creditor
relationship,
and
that
same
policy
has
also
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
energy
resources
case
when,
in
dealing
with
the
context
of
trust
fund
taxes,
this
court
recognized
in
an
operating
chapter
11
case
the
importance
of
permitting
the
designation
of
the
responsible
officer
type
of
trust
fund
taxes
to
be
paid
ahead
of
the
nonresponsible
officer
types
of
taxes
and
interest.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
at
least
two
or
three
things
that
congress
had
in
mind.
the
legislative
history
states
very
clearly
that
it
intends
the
courts
to
continue
to
apply
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination,
which
are
first,
misconduct,
or
claims
of
a
status
susceptible
to
subordination
such
as
penalties.
the
legislative
history
did
not
define
penalties,
but
congress
was
aware
of
certainly
the
simonson
case
as
well
as
any
other
case
which
it
might
refer
to
where
this
court
expressed
the
repugnance
of
penalties
generally,
not
just
nonpecuniary
loss
penalties,
but
all
penalties,
and
how
that
adversely
affected
the
policy
of
equality
of
distribution
to
creditors,
a
policy
which
is
critical
to
the
opportunity
for
courts
to
reorganize.
the
requirement
for
misconduct
in
order
to
subordinate
is
not
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
to
the
contrary,
in
the
context
of
prepetition,
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalty
claims,
those
would
normally
be
general
unsecured
claims
under
507(a),
now
(8),
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
if
those
are
to
share
equally,
you
could
not
get
a
confirmed
chapter
11
plan.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
yes,
your
honor,
that
comes
in,
but
that
is
not
a
limitation,
that
is
an
example.
that
is
how
the
subordination
principles
began
to
evolve
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
they
were
looking
at
the
conduct,
but
those
were
the
facts
presented
in
that
case.
there
was
no
prior
case
before
this
court
dealing
with
a
nonpecuniary
loss
until
the
simonson
case,
where
it
was
dealt
with
by
the
statute,
where
the
statute
stated
that
non...
prepetition
nonpecuniary
loss
of
tax
penalty
claims
were
disallowed.
not
just
subordinated,
totally
disallowed.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor,
the
statute
said
that,
but
the
court
interpreted
the
statute,
and
in
interpreting
the
statute
stated
that
all
penalties...
it
did
not
just
say
these
particular
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalties,
and
that
is
the
critical
theme.
it
is
the
nonpecuniary
loss
nature,
rather
than
the
timing
of
the
penalty,
which
is
one
of
the
elements
to
be
considered.
it
may
be
the
primary
element,
but
it
is
not
the
sole
element.
and
it
is
up
to
the
bankruptcy
courts,
through
the
exercise
of
their
discretion,
with
the
guidance
from
this
court
and
other
courts,
to
determine
under
what
circumstances
is
it
appropriate
to
subordinate.
certainly,
congress
could
not
contemplate
all
of
the
circumstances.
when
it
drafted
section
510
of
the
bankruptcy
code
it
was
intended
to
apply
across
the
board
to
all
chapters,
not
just
chapter
7
cases.
when
it
drafted
section
510
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
all
chapters,
not
just
bankruptcy
cases,
and
in
this
context
we
have
a
very
narrow
set
of
facts.
we
have
a
chapter
11
case,
where
a
debtor
was
permitted
to
operate.
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
the
creditor
should
act
as
private
attorney
general
in
order
to
prevent
the
nonpayment
of
taxes.
we
submit
that's
not
realistic.
the
creditors
don't
know
that
the
taxes
are
not
paid
until
the
return
is
not
filed,
or
is
filed,
and
then
the
taxes
are
not
paid
and
the
penalty
is
not
paid.
by
that
point
in
time,
the
damage
is
done.
the
creditors
cannot
change
what
has
already
transpired.
there
may
be
a
distinction,
in
fact,
between
a
failure
to
file
penalty
and
a
failure
to
pay
penalty.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
--your
honor,
it
is
not
the
trustees,
it
is
the
officers
of
the
corporation.
mr.
raymond
j.
pikna
thank
you,
your
honor.
