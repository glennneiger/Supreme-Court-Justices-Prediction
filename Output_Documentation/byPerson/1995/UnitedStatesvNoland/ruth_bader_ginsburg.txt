before
you
do,
mr.
jones,
could
you
give
us
an
example
of
the
rare
case
in
which
a
tax
penalty
claim
could
be
subordinated,
and
you
quoted
the
legislative
history
to
that
effect.
you
said
that
it
would
be
a
rare
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i
was
trying
to
envision
such
a
case
and
couldn't
come
up
with
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pikna,
the
first
item
under
any
tax,
under
503,
is
any
fine,
so
congress
was
certainly
thinking
in
terms
of
penalty,
so
we
have
fine,
and
then
penalty,
and
you
are
not
urging
any...
in
any
case,
where
there
was
a
fine
or
a
penalty,
on
your
theory
wouldn't
there
be
equitable
subordination
as
long
as
the
state
didn't
have
enough
to
pay
all
the
general
creditors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
give
me
a
circumstance
in
which
the
estate
does
not
have
enough
money
to
go
around,
that
has
been
a
nonpecuniary
tax
penalty.
when
would
it
not
be
subordinated
on
your
theory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
it's
a
small
penalty
it
comes
out
in
top
and
the
government
gets
it,
but
if
it's
a
large
penalty
the
government
doesn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
same
thing
with
a
fine,
a
small
fine,
the
government--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pikna,
do
you
say
that
because
in
the
chapter
11
the
company
may
survive,
may
come
out?
but
when
i
put
the
question
to
you
i
said,
we
have
to
make
the
assumption
that
there's
not
enough
to
go
around.
if
there's
enough
to
go
around,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you're
priority
1
or
priority
10.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
i
don't
understand
on
your
theory
is,
in
a
case
where
we
know
there
is
not
enough
to
go
around--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--like
your
chapter
7
case,
is
there
any
situation
in
which
a
fine
would
not
be
subordinated,
a
fine
or
a
penalty,
nonpecuniary
penalty
would
not
be
subordinated
to
the
claims
of
the
general
creditors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying--
--but
while
the
business
is
ongoing
you
wouldn't
get
to
the
bankruptcy
code
and
it's
priorities,
so
the
only
time
you
get
to
these
priorities
is
if
the
thing
is
postpetition
and
you're
in
a
bankruptcy
and
you're
distributing
and
there's
not
enough
to
go
around.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
we're
not
concerned
with
priorities,
are
we,
at
that
stage?
