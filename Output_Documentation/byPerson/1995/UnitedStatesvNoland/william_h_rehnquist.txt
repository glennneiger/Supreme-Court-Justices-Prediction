chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
95-323,
united
states
v.
thomas
r.
noland.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
brought
as
shareholder
as
opposed
to
brought
as
creditor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
pikna,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
could
one
bankruptcy
court
decide
a
case
like
that
one
way,
and
another
bankruptcy
court
decide
the
case
the
other
way?
i
mean,
is
it
a
matter
of
just
individual
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
bankruptcy
judge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we'd
have
different
outcomes
all
over
the
country,
depending
on
the
judgment
of
individual
bankruptcy
judges?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
court
just
decides
for
itself
what
types
of
claims
are
very
important
and
what
are
less
important?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
congress
has
made
different
findings...
you
know,
i
think
congress
probably
thinks
that
most
of
its
laws
are
pretty
important
and
deserve
priority,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
just
sorts
it
out
depending
on
the
recital
at
the
beginning
of
the
statute
as
to
how
important
it
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
the
factor
emphasized
by
the
court
in
those
cases,
was
it?
i
thought
it
was
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
claimant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
any
suggestion
in
those
cases
that
that
sort
of
a
distinction
would
have
been
made
by
those
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
misconduct
comes
in
through
the
language
of
510(c),
where
it
says,
principles
of
equitable
subordination,
doesn't
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--because
it
was
those
principles,
the
misconduct,
that
had
been
the
dominant
theme
of
those
three
cases
that
you
referred
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
certainly
in
each
of
those
three
cases
it
seemed
to
me
when
i
read
them
that
the
stress
was
on
the
conduct
of
a
particular
individual
in
pursuing
the
claim,
not
on
any
general
transposition
of
the
priorities
that
had
been
given
by
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
statute
said
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
that
really
isn't
much
of
a
precedent
for
your
argument
here.
i
mean,
if
the
statute
says
something,
that's
pretty
much
the
end
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pikna.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
mr.
jones,
could
you
tell
me,
how
does
it
work
if
the
officers
are
liable
for
the
tax?
does
the
government
have
a
choice
of
whether
it
goes
to
the
officers
first
or
the
corporation
first?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
