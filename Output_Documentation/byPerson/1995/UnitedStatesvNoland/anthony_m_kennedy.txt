anthony
m.

i
take
it
if
you
went
after
the
officer,
he'd
then
be
just
a
general
unsecured
creditor
against
the
corporation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
i'm
assuming
a
situation
where
the
officer
is
solvent.
the
government
goes
after
him
and
gets
the
tax
from
him.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
officer
then
become
a
general
unsecured
creditor
against
the
corporation
for
having
paid
the
corporate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
argument
was
there's
no
incentive
because
the
penalty
isn't
passed
through.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
understood
that
the
officer's
not
liable
for
the
penalty,
and
counsel's
point,
counsel
for
the
respondents,
said,
well,
there's
no
incentive
here
because
the
officer
is
never
liable
for
the
penalty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
only
the
corporation
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
the
point
was
that
there
was
no
inducement,
or
no
incentive,
because
the
officer's
never
going
to
be
liable
for
the
penalty
anyway.
