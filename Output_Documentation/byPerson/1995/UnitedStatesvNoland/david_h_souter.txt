justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
those
of
us
who
look
to
legislative
history
have
got
one
problem
from
your
standpoint,
and
that
is,
it
may
be
that
the
person
who
made
the
statement
about
the
intent
was
wrong
in
describing
what
courts
had
been
doing,
but
the
intent
still
seems
to
be
there,
and
what
is
the
tie
breaker?
do
we
look
to
the
person's
mistake,
or
to
the
person's
intent
in
making
the
statement?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
there
also
a
statement
in
that
report
that
is
not
simply
case
law
frozen
as
of
a
point
in
time
but
case
law
as
further
developed?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
a
case
in
which
some
factotum
of
the
government
said
the
payment,
let's
say
to
an
erisa
plan
or
whatever
it
may
be,
is
due
in
january,
and
in
fact
it
was
due
in
december
and
the
government
is
not
estopped?
i
suppose
you
could
say
that's
not
a
case
of
malicious
wrongdoing,
but
it
would
be
a
case
in
which
the
taxpayer
relied
detrimentally
on
the
government
and
then
ends
up
with
perhaps
a
nonwaivable
penalty.
that
would
be
a
case,
i
suppose,
in
which
there
could
be
subordination.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
pikna,
the
problem
that
i
have
in
the
case
is
a
very
broad
conceptual
one.
that
is,
i
can
understand
why
congress
would
say,
there
are
cases
which
we
cannot
envision
and
cannot
provide
for
by
law
because
they
turn
on
individual
wrongdoing,
or
individual
conduct
in
any
event,
and
we
want
you,
the
courts,
to
provide
for
them.
i
can
understand
why
congress
would
do
that.
what
i
cannot
understand,
and
what
would
worry
me
very
much,
would
be
why
congress
would
say,
we
want
you,
in
effect,
to
reorder
the
priorities
that
we
have
set,
and
to
do
so
as
a
categorical
matter
because
you
think
certain
priorities
are
unworthy
of
the
position
that
we
have
given
them.
that
is
statutory
amendment.
i
mean,
that
is
delegation,
to
put
it
another
way,
without
any
standard
at
all.
it
is
just
saying,
go
out
there
and
reshuffle
the
cards
as
you
think
right.
that's
the
conceptual
problem
that
bothers
me.
what
is
your
answer
to
the
seeming
impropriety,
perhaps
even
unconstitutionality
of
saying
to
a
court,
we
have
established
priorities,
but
you
go
out
and
do
anything
you
want
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
individual
elements
determine
what
goes
into
the
category,
and
you
are
saying
that
certain
category
members
should
not
be
given
the
priority
that
their
categories
give
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
congress
considered
the
nature
of
the
claim
when
it
established
the
categories,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
this
isn't
something
that
congress
a)
overlooked,
or
b)
could
not
provide
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
one
doesn't
say
that,
and
that's
not
what
the
government
is
saying.
the
government
is
saying
that
in
fact
a
court
may
consider
the
kind
of
individual
circumstances
that
bear
on
the
conscience
of
equity
that
simply
cannot
be
provided
for
in
a
categorical
way
in
advance
by
a
legislature,
and
that
is
all
it
has
done,
and
once
you
get
beyond
that,
you
have
basically
gotten
into
statutory
redrafting,
or
a
claim
of
delegation
not
only
without
standards
but
standards
quite
contrary
to
those
that
congress
adopted,
and
that
would
seem
to
be
an
illegitimate
interpretation
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
just
saying
we're
only
going
to
attack
a
portion
of
the
category
rather
than
the
whole
category,
but
it's
still
a
category
mistake,
in
effect,
that
you're
claiming
on
congress'
part,
and
at
least
a
partial
categorical
reordering
that
you're
claiming
for
the
court's
authority
under
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
distinction
is
that
each
misconduct
claim
is
judged
on
its
merits
as
a
particular
misconduct
claim,
and
it
is
the
kind
of
claim
that
simply
cannot
be
provided
for
any
more
precisely
in
advance.
these
claims,
indeed,
could
be
provided
for
more
precisely
in
advance,
and
if
the
courts
of
appeals
have
their
way,
there
will
be
a
constant,
categorical
reordering.
there
won't
be
any
individualized
inquiry
in
a
particular
case.
you'll
simply
say,
is
this
the
kind
of
penalty,
whoops,
no
priority
for
you,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
those
are
fundamentally
different
enterprises...
processes.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
think...
with
respect,
i
think
your
answer
doesn't
go
to
my
categorical
problem.
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
what
if
congress
had
passed
the
bankruptcy
act
in
its
present
form
with
one
exception,
and
the
exception
is
that
in
place
of
the
provision
that
we're
fussing
over
this
morning
congress
had
simply
said,
we've
established
these
priorities,
but
the
courts
can,
in
fact,
rearrange
them
if
they
want
to,
would
that
statute
be
in
any
kind
of
trouble?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
would
be
citing
schechter
if
that
had
been
the
case,
wouldn't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
a
degree,
the
degree
being
only
the
one
category
that
you're
arguing
about,
that
is
what
you
are
arguing
that
the
courts
are
able
to
do
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
an
example
of
what
we
both
agree
would
have
been
improper.
