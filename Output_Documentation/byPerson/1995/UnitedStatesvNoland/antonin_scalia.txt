justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
statement,
mr.
jones,
appears...
i
mean,
it
was
obviously
carefully
drawn
up.
it
appears
verbatim
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
almost
like
a
committee
report.
the
floor
leader
in
both
chambers
reads
exactly
the
same
text.
do
you
want
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a
mistake,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--insofar
as
it
shows
what
the
expectation
or
the
intent
of
congress
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
congress
expected
and
intended
that
a
penalty
would
be
subject
to
this
doctrine.
congress
is
not
in
the
business
of
figuring
out
what
case
law
says.
it
is
in
the
business
of
figuring
out
what
disposition
should
be
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
am
i
correct
that
every
lower
court
that
has
confronted
this
issue
has
come
out
the
way
the
court
came
out
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
under
this
statutory
provision,
under
the
provision
we're
dealing
with
here,
is
there
any
case
that
comes
out
the
way
you
say
this
case
should
come
out,
denying
the
subordination
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
says
otherwise?
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
the
court
here
says
is
that
the
doctrine
didn't
develop
into
this
area
before
the
code,
because
before
the
code
nonpecuniary
loss
tax
penalties
did
not
exist--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
how
they
explained--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
lack
of
any
pre
code
development.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
other
exceptions,
other
than
de
minimis,
which
i
don't
consider
much
of
an
exception.
i
mean,
that's
an
exception
to
everything
in
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
de
minimis
non
corat
lex.
it's
not
an
exception
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
applies
across
the
board.
but
except
for
that,
every
time
there's
a
fine
you
want
us
to
say
it
is
subordinated.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
fineness
that
causes
the
subordination,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
correct
me,
but
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
any
policy
that
has
traditionally
been
considered
stronger
than
the
policy
of
collecting
taxes.
i
mean,
we
even
allow
property
to
be
seized
before
the
issue
is
resolved.
i
mean,
is
there
anything
that
we've
given
higher
priority
to
than
the
ability
of
government
to
get
the
money
in
order
to
run?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
environment's
more
important?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
no
sure
our
cases
would
support
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
better
or
worse.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
what
our
cases
seem
to
say.
justice
scalia's
opinion
certainly
wouldn't.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
isn't
that
always
the
case?
i
mean,
what
you're
arguing
is,
congress
should
not
have
said
in
503(b)(1)(c)
any
fine,
penalty,
or
reduction
in
credit
relating
to
a
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
a
fine
relating
to
a
nonpayment
of
tax,
isn't
it
always
going
to
come
from
the
creditors?
justice
antonin
scalia
those
other
cases,
when
you
take
the
money
away
from
the
debtor
you're
effectively
taking
it
away
from
the
creditors.
the
debtor
is
still
operating
in
a
bankruptcy
context,
isn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
see.
you
view
it
as
being
taken
away
from
the
creditors
in
the
title
vii
context
but
not
in
other
contexts.
i'm
not
sure
that's
realistic.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
won't
help
the
creditors
in
that
case,
but
future
trustees
will
know
that
by
not
paying
taxes
they're
not
going
to
make
more
money
available
to
the
creditors.
in
fact,
they'll
make
less.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
worthwhile.
