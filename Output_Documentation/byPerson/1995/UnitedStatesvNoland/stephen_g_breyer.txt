justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
position...
all
right,
everyone
seems
to
agree
that
principles
of
equitable
subordination
apply.
next
question,
what
are
those
principles?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
those
principles?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
the
first
thing,
you
might
take
the
position
those
principles
are
that,
a)
you
never
can
equitably
subordinate
unless
the
holder
of
that
particular
piece
of...
the
creditor,
that
particular
creditor
has
done
something
bad.
i
take
it
that
that
is
not
your
position.
if
it
is
your
position,
i
take
it
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
case
in
which
they
said
that
some
stockholders
who
were
asserting
a
claim
of
fraud
who
did
nothing
wrong
were
equitably
subordinated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
the...
is
it
your
view
that,
no
matter
what,
if
you
didn't
do
something
bad
and
you're
a
creditor
you
cannot
be
equitably
subordinated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you're
saying
that
the
5
to
4
decision
in
comstock,
which
was
basically
a
matter
of
the
words
used
in
that
opinion,
which
were
very
eloquent,
you
think
that
those
words
overruled,
sub
silentio,
the
earlier
case
in
which
shareholders
who
had
asserted
a
claim
of
fraud
against
the
corporation
had
their
claim
subordinated
to
others,
i
take
it,
because
the
judge
felt
this
is
simply
a
way
in
which
shareholders
that
should
be
absolutely
at
the
end
of
the
queue
have
worked
out
to
jump
a
lot
of
other
people
who
would
otherwise
have
been
ahead
of
them,
so
they
assert
their
claim
in
the
form
of
a
claim
for
fraud.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
assume
you're
right
about
it.
credit
industrial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
stirling
homex.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
always...
let's
assume
it
always
has
been.
as
i
nonetheless
read
the
words
of
the
statutes,
and
so
forth,
isn't...
you
reply
to
that
by
saying,
yes,
but
the
doctrine
was
a
common
law
doctrine
developed
by
judges,
and
there
was
no
intent
by
congress
to
freeze
its
contours.
just
continue
as
you're
continuing.
you
find
over
the
course
of
time,
very
slowly,
that
it
needs
to
be
shaped
a
little
bit,
that's
what
courts
do.
we
don't
want
to
change
the
law.
we
don't
freeze
it
as
it
was
at
the
time
of,
you
know,
henry
iv
or
whatever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
there
could
be
a
case...
i
mean,
there
could
be
a
case.
that's
the
part
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
to
justice
scalia
was
that
prepetition
tax
penalties
were
out
of
the
queue--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
absolute
bottom.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
postpetition
tax
penalties
were
number
1.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
then
that
supports
an
argument
that,
sure,
creditor
misconduct
is
perhaps
not
always
required.
suppose
this
were
a
prepetition
tax
penalty.
but
here,
there's
no
good
reason
for
the
equitable
subordination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that...
i
mean,
i'm
making
work
because
i'm
interested
in
that
aspect
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
they're
the
same,
it's
pretty
weird
that
congress,
without
even
mentioning
it
or
thinking
about
it,
where
there's
a
prepetition
tax
penalty
would
have
decided
without
saying
a
word
to
jump
them
from
the
absolute
bottom,
behind
shareholders,
to
absolute
number
1--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--without
any
mood...
room
for
flexibility,
because
that
would
be
the
effect
of
it,
prepetition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
just
answer
two
technical
questions
that
i...
one
was
justice
scalia's
initial
question,
which
the
government
said...
is
this
correct,
do
you
agree
with
the
government
in
this,
and
do
i
understand
this
correctly
that,
prior
to
the
bankruptcy
code
a
penalty
on
a
postpetition
tax
did,
in
fact,
receive
a
first
priority?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
thank
you.
the
second
question
that
i
had
is
just
as
technical,
and
i
want
to
know
how
it
works.
imagine
that
you
are
in
chapter
11,
and
we
don't
really
have
a
lot
of
money,
but
we're
trying
to
struggle
to
keep
the
company.
i
would
imagine
that
the
president
of
the
company
and
the
executives
who
are
there
running
it
ought
to
pay
their
taxes,
and
if
they
don't,
i
don't
know
why
they
shouldn't
have
to
pay
penalties
the
same
as
anybody
else,
and
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
an
administrative
expense
like
anything
else,
postpetition.
but
i
did
imagine
from
what
you're
saying
that
there
could
be
a
case
where
we're
finding
it
hard
to
get
unanimous
agreement
among
unsecured
creditors,
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
works
out
that
if
i
could
subordinate
the
penalty
on
the
tax
below
the
unsecured
creditors
there
will
be
enough
money
for
them
under
a
section
7,
and
therefore
i
don't
need
the
unanimity,
and
that
might
be
why
he
wants
to
subordinate
in
the
chapter
11.
he
wants
the
authority
to
have
subordinated
the
penalty
in
the
hypothetical
chapter
7.
now,
i
raise
that
to
know
if
that's
technically
right,
or
if
it's
not,
just
say
no,
and
i
will
erase
it
from
my
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
explore
if
there's
any
circumstance,
other
than
de
minimis,
in
which
it
would
make
sense,
given
all
the
equitable
authority
in
the
world,
to
subordinate
a
postpetition
tax
penalty,
and
i'm
struggling
to
think
if
there's
any
such
circumstance,
and
so
far,
given
your
answers,
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
there
is
no
such
circumstance
that
would
be
special.
so
i'm
trying
to
think,
i'm
struggling,
is
there
any
circumstance
in
which
it
would
make
sense,
equitably,
and
your
answer
to
that,
which
you
have
a
strong
interest
in
saying
i'm
wrong,
all
right,
why
am
i
wrong?
that's
what
everybody's
been
asking
you,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
identified,
i
take
it,
not
this
case
but
a
very
unusual
situation.
you're
in
chapter
11.
the
penalties
amount...
postpetition
tax
penalties
amount
to
$10
million.
if
you
must
give
them
first
priority
in
a
section
7,
you're
not
going
to
get
agreement
of
the
unsecured
creditors
on
the
11
plan.
but
if
the
bankruptcy
judge
could
say,
ha
ha,
in
a
7
i
could
subordinate
the
$10
million
to
you,
unsecured
creditors,
then
there
would
be
enough
under
the
11
plan
to
give
them
what
they
would
have
gotten
in
section
7,
and
therefore
the
bankruptcy
trustee
can
get
approval
without
unanimity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
what
i'd
raised
before
because
i
got
that
somehow
out
of
the
briefs.
now,
that's
what
i
wanted--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
maybe
i
don't...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
and
that's
why
what
the
bankruptcy
trustee
wants
to
say,
well,
were
i
in
a
7,
i'd
take
the
$10
million
and
put
it
at
the
end
of
the
queue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
that
power,
and
therefore
i
don't
have
to
count
it
against--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--unless
they
could
be
equitably
subordinated--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that's...
see,
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
find--
