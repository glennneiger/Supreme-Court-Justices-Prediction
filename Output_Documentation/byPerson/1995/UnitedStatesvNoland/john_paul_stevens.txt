justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
of
course,
it
isn't
just
the...
the
concurring
opinion
didn't
rely
on
that
in
the
court
below,
am
i
correct?
she
just
relied
on
the
plain
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
apply
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
she
didn't
read
that
as
requiring
creditor
misconduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
joined
the
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
she
did
not
rely
on
legislative
history.
she
relied
just
on
the
text
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how
did
she
get
to
join
the
judgment
if
she
didn't...
you
know,
if
she
agreed
with
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
she
didn't
have
to
discuss
it,
because
she
held
that
it
did
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
her
basic
point,
as
i
read
it,
the
reason
she
wrote
was
she
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
look
at
legislative
history
because
she
thought
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
covered
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
i
thought
she
wrote
separately.
