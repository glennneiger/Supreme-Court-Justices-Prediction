justice
david
h.
souter
well,
bounds
said
that
in
so
many
words,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
take
the
position
that,
if
a
prisoner
is
illiterate
or
is
illiterate
in
english,
that
that...
that
the
requirements
therefore
are
still
satisfied
so
long
as
there
is,
in
fact,
a
library
in
existence
to
which
the
prisoner
could
resort
if
he
were
able
to
read
it,
or
a
legal
helper
to
whom
he
could
turn
if
he
were
able
to
communicate?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
--so
there
is
no
obligation
to
an
illiterate
prisoner.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
--but
that
turns...
i'm
sorry,
i
keep
interrupting
justice--
--go
ahead...
no,
go
ahead.
this
will
be
my
last
question.
that,
it
seems
to
me
turns
the
requirements
even
in
the
strict
either-or
sense
into
pure
formalities.
we're
placing
books
in
front
of
someone
who
cannot
read
them,
and
we're
placing
legal
helpers
in
front
of
someone
who
cannot
communicate
with
them.
that
seems
utterly
senseless.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it
senseless?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then
you're
not
taking
the
position
that
it's
irrelevant
that
they're
illiterate,
then.
you're
not
saying,
we
can
comply
in
a
purely
formal
way,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
correct?
you're
not...
i
thought
you
were
taking
the
formalistic
position,
and
now,
it
seems
to
me,
you're
not.
am
i
correct
that
you
are
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
--let
me
put
it
another
way.
do
you
deny
that
you
have
any
affirmative
obligation
to
give
the
prisoners
some
capacity,
whether
it
be
through
other
prisoners,
family,
friends,
the
group
you
were
mentioning,
to
be
able
to
use
the
library
or
to
have
access
in
some
other
way?
do
you
deny
that
you
have
any
affirmative
obligation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
seems
to
me
a
somewhat
negative
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
you
deny
that
you
have
any
affirmative
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if
you
had
a
prisoner
who
had
no
friends
and
there
were
no
other
prisoners
who
could
or
would
help
him,
and
there
were
no
legal
assistants,
and
all
there
was
was
a
library,
you
would
say,
we
have
done
all
that
the
law
requires?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
your
case...
do
you
rest
your
whole
case,
win
or
lose,
on
that
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
have
one
question,
if
i
may.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
essentially
two
kinds
of
legal
as
opposed
to
factual
issues
here,
that
the
first
we've
spent
a
lot
of
time
on,
and
that
is,
what
is
the
required
level
of
access
and
so
on,
and
whether
you
have
an
affirmative
obligation.
the
other
one
you've
touched
upon
a
couple
of
times
by
reference
to
turner,
and
that
is,
how
do
we
measure
sort
of
what,
kind
of
the
reasonable
level
of
required
service
may
be,
or
required
opportunity.
i
think
i'm
correct
that
you
argued
on
the
basis
of
turner
in
at
least
your
reply
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit.
did
you
go
to
the
district
court
at
any
time
and
say,
look,
we
not
only
have
to
apply
bounds
here,
we
have
to
apply
bounds
in
the
light
of
turner,
which
sort
of
looks,
as
it
were,
to
both
sides
of
the
equation.
did
you
make
that
argument
to
the
district
court
that
it
wasn't
applying
turner
and
should
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
would...
on
what
i'm
calling
here
sort
of
the
second
issue,
call
it
the
overreaching
issue
if
you
want
to,
do
you
believe
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
return
the
case
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
perhaps
have
them
return
it
to
the
district
court
for
a
consideration
of
turner?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
want
an
all-or-nothing
win
here,
in
effect.
[laughter]
a
win
or
loss.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
had
five
opportunities,
but
were
they
ever
given
the
opportunity
to
propose,
to
draft
and
propose
their
own
order?
did
the
judge
ever
give
them
that
opportunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's...
what
form
did
it
give
them,
the
right
to
comment
on
its
proposal?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
ms.
alexander,
on
a
broader
level...
i
think
justice
o'connor
has
raised
this...
my
reading
of
the
district
court
order
and
i
believe
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
fails
even
i
think
to
disclose
a
single
citation
to
turner.
do
you
claim
that...
let
me
ask
you
two
questions.
do
you
agree
that
turner
is
applicable
here,
that
bounds
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
turner?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
i'll
tell
you
what
my
second
question
is,
because
that
may
be
what
you're
going
to
get
at.
even
though
neither
court,
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
so
much
as
cited
turner,
do
you
claim
that
turner
was
in
fact
applied
by
the
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
that
boils
down
to
saying
that
if
we
assume
turner
was
applied,
that
particular
aspect
of
the
order
is
not
inconsistent
as
a
matter
of
law
with
a
turner
analysis,
but
that's
about
as
far
as
we
can
go,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
we...
yes,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
those
things
may
be
taken
care
of
maybe
by
four
or
five
form
books
has
there
been
any
studies
to
show
the
effectiveness,
the
cost
effectiveness
of
these
massive
libraries?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
federal
system
it's
now
running
1
percent
successful.
