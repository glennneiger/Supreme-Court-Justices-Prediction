justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
woods,
was
there
a
point...
ever
a
point,
after
finding
constitutional
violation,
at
which
the
state
was
asked
to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
cure
the
violation,
or
was
this
directly
referred
to
a
special
master?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
before
that,
isn't
it
usual
in
these
situations
to
give
the
state
the
first
opportunity
to
present
a
remedial
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
ask
at
any
point
to
be
permitted
to
do
that
before
you
encountered
the
special
master?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
woods,
isn't
it
the
case
that
in
bounds
the
district
judge
would
have
preferred
some
other
form
of
legal
assistance?
it
was
the
state
that
decided
that
the
library
was
a
better
way
for
it
to
go.
this
court
mentioned
both,
but
the
district
court
in
that
case,
i
thought,
had
made
it
clear
that
he
thought
it
would
be
a
much
better
idea
to
provide
some
form
of
legal
assistance
other
than
federal
reporters,
state
reporters
on
a
shelf.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
the
state
that
made
this
choice,
isn't
it,
the
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
not
something
that
this
court,
and
surely
not
the
district
court
in
bounds,
dictated.
and
haven't
you
made
that
same
choice?
in
other
words,
you're
defending
your
position,
or
advocating
your
position
based
on
the
adequacy
of
the
library
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
woods,
are
you
attacking...
you're
saying
the
findings
themselves
were
not
sufficient,
or
the
evidence
beneath
them,
because
i
think
you
told
us
that
these
findings
didn't
originate
with
the
judge,
that
they
were,
indeed,
i
think
you
said
verbatim
what
were
submitted
to
him,
the
findings
that
he
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
alexander,
is
that
common
in
these
institutional
decrees?
i
think
it's
something
that
juts
out
in
this
case,
and
whether
we're
talking
about
prisons,
schools,
other
institutions,
isn't
it
usual
for
the
alleged
offender,
the
state,
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
come
up
with
a
plan,
and
if
that's
no
good,
sometimes
the
court
has
to
devise
its
own?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
alexander,
but
what
about
the
problem
that
we
were
discussing
before
about
who
frames
the
remedy?
you...
if
you
think
that
we
are...
we
have
no
reason
to
be
concerned
with
the
method
by
which
this
decree
was
arrived
at,
that
is,
a
special
master
was
appointed,
he
drafted
the
decree,
how
do
you
answer
the
question
that
the
state
never
had
a
chance
to
come
up
with
its
own
plan?
should
it
not
be
given
now
a
chance
to
do
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
judge
never
said
why
he
wasn't...
nothing
on
the
record
indicates
why
the
state
wasn't
given
an
opportunity
to
present
a
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
would
be...
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
that
we
should
make
the
best
case
for
the
judge
why
he
didn't
ask
the
state
to
come
up
with
a
plan
first,
and
i
could
agree
with
you
that
it's
not
an
inexorable
requirement
in
every
case,
but
there's
a
lot
of
litigation
like
this,
and
this
is
an
important
question
about
what
is
the
general
way
of
proceeding.
so
if
it's
proper
here
for
the
judge
to
say,
system-wide
violation,
i
will
appoint
a
special
master,
that's
one
thing.
if
it's
not
appropriate,
what
should
the
judge
do
once
he
finds
a
system-wide
violation?
