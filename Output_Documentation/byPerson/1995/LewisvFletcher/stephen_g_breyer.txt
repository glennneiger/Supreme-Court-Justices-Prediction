justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right,
let's...
i
mean,
that's
fairly
normal,
parties
submit
findings
and
the
judge--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the...
following
up
on
what
justice
stevens
said,
as
i
read
this,
and
your
opponents
say
this,
at
the
heart
of
this
decree...
there
are
a
lot
of
provisions
to
it,
and
i
think
your
opponents,
to
my
reading,
concede
that
some
are
overreaching,
but
at
the
heart
of
it
lie
261
prisoners
who
are
locked
up,
and
what
i
think
it
found
is,
respect
to
those
who
were
locked
up
in
solitary
confinement,
or
whatever,
that
often
they
can
only
ask
for
one
or
two
law
books
at
a
time,
and
there
are
frequently
long
delays,
1
day,
2
days,
3
days,
and
sometimes
weeks
before
they
get
those
one
or
two
law
books.
that
seems
supported
in
the
record,
and
your
opponents
concede
that
we
could
modify
the
decree
in
that
respect,
and
they
don't
have
to
be
escorted
across
the
place.
all
they
have
to
have,
on
page
39,
is
some
effective
method,
all
right.
the
second
major
part
of
this
was
the
hispanic
population,
and
possibly
the
illiterates,
and
as
for
the
hispanic
population,
there
are
a
lot
of
them,
and
there
are
findings
that
the
hispanic
people
cannot
read
these
law
books
and
are
not
given
proper
assistance
of
any
sort,
such
as
organizing
other
hispanic
bilingual
prisoners,
and
the
decree
in
that
respect
didn't
require
too
much.
it
simply
required
that
they
get
down
to
figuring
out
how
these
hispanic
people
systematically
could
rely
on
bilingual
prisoners
to
help
them
out.
all
right.
at
least
as
to
those
two
key
matters,
which
i
think
everyone
thinks
are
at
the
heart
of
this,
is
there
any
argument
that
we...
i
mean,
why
shouldn't
we
do
just
what
your
opponents
tell
us
to
do
in
that
respect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
either
to
modify
or
to
affirm
those
two
key
provisions,
and
then
systematically,
it
wouldn't
take
too
long,
go
through
the
other
ones
and
see
whether
they
may
or
may
not
have
gone
beyond
the
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
were
complaining
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--was
just
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
not
injury
in
the
fact,
to
take
one
example,
a
person
is
locked
down.
he
says,
i
would
like
to
see
some
law
books.
he
makes
a
request.
he
gets
no
books
for
many
days.
finally,
he
gets
one
book.
then
he
has
to
ask
for
another
book.
it
would
take
him
4
years
before
he
was
able
to
have
enough
books
actually
to
see
what
the
law
was.
i
mean,
those
seem
found
here.
isn't
that
injury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
what
about
the...
wanting
law
books
either
for
collateral
attacks
on
his
conviction
or
because
he
feels
he's
being
treated
in
an
unlawful
manner?
i
imagine
people
don't
read
these
books
for
their
health.
i
assume
they
have
a
reason
for
wanting
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be
the
policy,
but
what
he
found
happened
was
that
they
are
routinely
denied
physical
access,
there
are
often
long
delays
in
receiving
books,
and
then
there's
a
lot
of
testimony
in
that
respect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question,
to
go
back
for
a
second...
because
you
know
a
lot
more
about
this
actually,
and
as
you've
read
into
the
constitutional
basis
for
bounds,
i
think
really
the
question
is
in
my
mind,
too,
what
part
of
the
constitution
rest
on?
naively,
i
have
thought,
well,
the
person
is
being
deprived
of
his
liberty.
he's
in
prison,
so
he's
deprived
of
his
liberty.
in
a
certain
number
of
cases,
small,
perhaps,
it
would
be
an
improper
deprivation,
and
he
has
to
have
some
kind
of
process
available,
or
at
least
he
can't
be
cut
off
from
process
through
which
he
could
challenge
what
could
be
an
unlawful
deprivation
of
his
liberty.
so
in
my
own
mind
i
was
pinning
it
on
the
fifth
or
fourteenth,
but
that's
a
naive
and
uninformed
reaction
compared
to
what
yours
will
be,
so
i
think
people
are
trying
to
get
at
what,
in
your
reading,
has
struck
you,
or
you've
come
to
the
conclusion
as
to
what
the
bounds
basis
is
in
the
constitution.
quite
literally
and
specifically,
what
amendment
do
you
tie
it
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
not
asking
you
to
accept
my
characterization.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
other
question,
if
i
could
ask
it
now,
is
as
you
say
in
your
brief
on
page
39,
for
example,
i
think
you
believe
yourself
that
in
certain
respects
this
decree
is
overdrawn,
and
your
opponent's
brief,
which
is
very
good,
points
out
certain
respects
it
is...
seemed
to
me
is
in
certain
respects
overdrawn,
yet
there
are
other
respects
that
you
point
to
which
may
have
a
good
basis,
and
they've
challenged
those
too,
but
i
mean,
the
evidence
seems
more
your
side,
in
my
opinion,
but
in
other
ones
not.
so
what,
in
your
view,
should
this
court
do
if
we
think
there
are
certain
basic
things
like
the
hispanic
and
261
locked-up
people,
where
the
evidence
is
not
too
terrible
for
you,
and
there
are
other
respects
where
the
evidence
seems
pretty
good
for
their
side,
and
so
what
should
we
do?
should
we
act
like
an
appeals
court
and
just
review
the
decree
as
if
we
were
an
appeals
court?
should
we
send
it
back?
how
do
we
get
to
the
result
even
that
you
want
on
page
39?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
evidence
here
the
evidence
in
footnotes
23,
24,
and
25
on
page
23a,
where
as
i
count
there
are
about
50
or
60
examples,
is
that
what...
do
you
know
what
i'm
referring
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
relevant
evidence
in
this
respect
to
the
261
lockdown
prisoners?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
more
than
that,
or
is
that
not
relevant?
i
mean,
that's
what
i
was
looking
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
count
30...
29
in
those
footnotes,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
actual
injury,
but
he
listed
29
instances
in
which
there
were
delays
that
he
thought
were
significant
or--
