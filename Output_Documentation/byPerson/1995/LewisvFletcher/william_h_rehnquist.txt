we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-1511,
samuel
a.
lewis
v.
fletcher
casey.
general
woods.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
the
constitutional
right
to
make
phone
calls
out
of
prison?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
woods.
ms.
alexander,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
speak
of
an
affirmative
obligation,
ms.
alexander.
now,
in
estelle
v.
gamble,
where
we
were
dealing
with
medical
claims
of
prisoners
under
the...
the
basic
approach
of
the
court
was,
you've
got
this
fellow
in
prison,
or
this
woman
in
prison,
and
they're
sick.
you
can't
just
leave
them
there
because
if
they
were
on
the
outside
of
the
prison
they
could
have
gone
and
done
something
about
it.
isn't...
shouldn't
our
approach
here
be
somewhat
similar?
the
idea
of
an
affirmative
obligation
to
do
more
than
the
person
could
have
done
if
he
were
outside,
i
don't
see
where
that
comes
from.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
he
has
appendicitis...
he's
not
beaten
up
in
the
prison.
he
just
has
some
disease
that
he
could
have
easily
just
as
well
gotten
outside,
but
still
he's
been
cut
off
from
access
to
other
medical
sources,
so
the
prison
has
to
supply
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
doesn't
have
to
supply
more
than
he
could
have
gotten
on
the
outside.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
they
have
to...
the
prisons
have
to
provide
advice
on
immigration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
provision
of
the
constitution
would
cause
that
to
be
required?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
get--
--well
now,
wait
a
minute,
collateral
to
the
criminal
justice
rights...
i
don't
really
understand
your
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
be
deported.
it's
not
criminal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
i...
give
me
some
idea
of
what...
how
many
individual
violations
you
have
to
get
of,
say,
the
performance
of
a
particular
prison
official
before
you
get
what's
called
a
systemic
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
district
court
under
some
obligation,
if
he's
going
to
give
a
system-wide
remedy,
to
say
this
is
the
reason
i
find
a
systemic
violation,
that
there
were
not
just
two
prisoners
who
failed
to
get
their
books,
but
that
there
were
26?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
if
you
say,
prisoners
are
not
getting
books,
is
it
two
prisoners,
is
it...
you
can't
challenge
that
finding
as
clearly
erroneous
if
only
two
got
it,
because
two
is
a
plural,
so
you
can't
challenge
that,
and
yet
it
doesn't
lay
the
groundwork
for
a
systemic
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
alexander.
general
woods,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
woods.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
