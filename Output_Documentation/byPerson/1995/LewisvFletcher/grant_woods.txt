mr.
grant
woods
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
inmate
access
to
the
court
case.
the
state
of
arizona
meets
and
exceeds
the
requirements
of
bounds
v.
smith
by
providing
at
the
time
of
trial
26
law
libraries
at
nine
separate
prison
complexes
across
the
state.
as
the
prison
population
has
grown
from
more
than
15,000
to
22,000
prisoners,
we
have
added
seven
more
libraries,
for
a
total
of
33.
in
addition
to
providing
adequate
legal
resources
to
the
inmates
through
these
law
libraries,
arizona
goes
above
and
beyond
the
requirements
of
bounds
by
facilitating
the
use
of
legal
clerks
and
legal
assistants
to
obtain
books
and
to
help
in
the
preparation
of
lawsuits.
also,
we
encourage
inmates
to
take
our
classes
to
teach
them
to
read
english,
and
we
find
interpreters
for
non-english-speaking
inmates.
we
facilitate
also
assistance
from
family,
from
friends,
outside
lawyers
and
paralegals
and
other
prisoner
rights
groups.
although
deference
to
state
officials
in
the
area
of
prison
administration
is
required
by
this
court,
the
district
court
in
this
case
has
imposed
an
order
which
micromanages
virtually
every
aspect
of
prison
life
in
this
area.
additionally,
the
district
court
has
entered
its
order
despite
a
record
that
has
not
established
an
injury
warranting
systemic
relief.
the
result
is
that
the
order
is
overbroad,
overreaching,
and
far
beyond
the
requirements
of
bounds.
mr.
grant
woods
we
believe
there
is
not,
justice
o'connor.
the
record
in
this
case
is
difficult,
and
it's
difficult
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
but
one
reason
is
because
it's
difficult
to
separate
pure
findings
of
fact
from
the
judge's
order,
from
how
he
has
extrapolated
that
based
upon,
we
believe,
his
misinterpretation
of
what
bounds
requires.
if
the
court--
mr.
grant
woods
--yes.
mr.
grant
woods
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
look
at
the
reasoning
behind
bounds,
and
how
it's
been--
mr.
grant
woods
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
we
believe
that's
the
proper
reading
of
bounds,
although
we--
mr.
grant
woods
--that's
correct.
we
believe
arizona
goes
far
beyond
the
requirement
of
bounds,
but
we
believe
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
bounds
is
that
a
law
library,
in
and
of
itself,
is
enough.
mr.
grant
woods
the
obligation
is
really
not
an
affirmative
duty.
i
think
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
apply...
as
the
courts
generally
have
over
the
past
18
years,
apply
the
strict
interpretation
of
bounds
and
the
language
of
bounds.
mr.
grant
woods
justice
souter--
mr.
grant
woods
--this
is
wy
we
believe
it's
not.
this
is...
again,
you
have
to
look
at
the
reasoning
behind
bounds,
and
we
believe
the
reason
the
court
ruled
the
way
it
did
in
bounds
is,
the
court
was
saying
that
what
we
have
to
do
is
put
prisoners
on
similar
footing
as
they
would
be
for
access
to
the
courts
to
people
who
are
not
incarcerated.
the
state
has
taken
a
step
in
their
lives
that
has
put
a
barrier
to
the
courts,
and
therefore
we
have
to...
we
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
provide
something
there,
in
this
case
a
law
library.
mr.
grant
woods
yes,
we
do,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
fallback
position
is
that
arizona
goes
above
and
beyond
the
requirements
of
bounds.
as
i've
said,
we
do
facilitate
legal
clerks,
legal
assistants.
they...
again,
you
have
to
go
to
what
we're
talking
about,
and
the
court
has
said
in--
mr.
grant
woods
--we're
asking
you
to
reverse
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
because
arizona
has
met
the
requirements
set
forth
in
bounds.
the
arizona
system
provides
meaningful
access,
and
you
can
find
that--
mr.
grant
woods
--yes,
we
are
making
that
argument.
we
don't
think
you
have
to
get
to
that,
but
if
you
find...
that
is
another
fallback
position.
clearly,
in
this
case,
if
you
found
that
we
were
not
in
compliance
with
bounds,
and
that
some
remediation
was
appropriate,
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
scope
of
the
injunction
and,
of
course,
when
you
look
at
a
litany
of
cases
from
dayton
through
the
recent
jenkins
case,
you
see
that
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
an
overbroad
order.
rather
than
finding
a
specific
systemic
injury
and
trying
to
resolve
that
specific
injury,
what
this
district
court
judge
has
done
has
basically
decided
how
he
would
micromanage
the
prison,
to
the
point
where
he
decides
where
people
sit
and
when,
who
goes,
and
when
they
go
to
the
library.
telephone
calls
is
just
one
example
i
would
give
you.
we
have
22,000
prisoners.
he's
mandating
by
this
order
that
we
have
to
provide,
now,
66,000
20-minute
calls
per
week.
mr.
grant
woods
well,
justice
ginsburg,
what
the
district
court
did
was,
we
had
a
prior
ruling
from
him
in
the
gluth
case
which
was
just
applicable
to
one
prison
unit
and,
again,
micromanaged
the
entire
unit
much
as
this
order
does.
he
told
us
that
he...
his
plan
was
to
put
this
order
in
place
throughout
the
state,
and
he
gave
us
the
opportunity
to
make
any
objections
which
we
wanted
to,
which
we
did,
but
the
ball
game
was
over
at
that
point.
mr.
grant
woods
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that's
exactly
what
bounds
requires,
is
that...
that
you
will
give
deference
to
the
states,
and
the
states
will
be
allowed
to
formulate
their
own
plans.
mr.
grant
woods
we
anticipated
that
that
would
be
how...
the
answer
is
yes,
but
we
were
not
allowed
to
do
so.
what
we
were
allowed
to
do
is
object
any
way
we
wanted
to
the
gluth
decision
being
imposed
upon
us
state-wide
and,
again,
i
think
that's
why
you
have
in
this
order.
if
you
see...
we
have
orders
for
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
record
there's
not
even
any
testimony
on.
we're
required
to
train
inmates,
for
example,
for
immigration
law,
for
divorce
and
custody
cases,
according
to
this
order.
we're--
mr.
grant
woods
--yes,
sir.
mr.
grant
woods
i
think
we've...
we've
considered
that,
and
i
think
these
things
will
change
with
the
advent
of
computers
and
technology
changing,
where
the
old
style
law
library
may
some
day
be
a
thing
of
the
past,
but
what
the
bounds
court
told
us
was
that
we
could
choose
between
a
law
library
or...
and
i
believe
the
disjunctive
was
used
something
like
10
times
in
the
decision...
or
some
other
form
of
legal
assistance.
most
states
have
chosen
a
law
library,
and--
mr.
grant
woods
--i
don't
know
specifically
if
anyone
has
been
bold
enough
to
do
that,
your
honor,
in
the
face
of
the
bounds
decision.
in
other
words,
we
have
felt
for
18
years
we're
required
to
do
a
law
library.
we
can
come
up
with
another
form
of--
mr.
grant
woods
--yes.
mr.
grant
woods
but
i
think
we
would
be...
i'm
supposing
that
the
states
would
be
hesitant
to
come
up
with
too
minimal
of
a
plan
for
fear
that
it
wouldn't
meet
the
standards,
and
also--
mr.
grant
woods
--well,
there
have
been...
there
have
been
commentators
who
have
commentated
upon
it,
but
i
don't
know
that
that's
particularly
persuasive.
i
think
that
the
bounds
court
understood,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
bounds
court
understood
that
there
are
illiterate
and
not
english-speaking
prisoners
in
every
prison
in
the
united
states.
there
were
then,
there
are
now,
there
always
will
be,
and
the
point
is--
mr.
grant
woods
--i
believe
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
this
court,
as...
following
the
direction
that
it
has
given
ever
since
then,
deferred
to
the
state
administrators,
which
is
only
reasonable
given
the
very
difficult
nature
of
prison
administration,
and
also--
mr.
grant
woods
--that's
correct.
mr.
grant
woods
yes,
we
have,
and
justice
kennedy,
let
me
make
it
clear
why
we
believe
it
is
adequate,
and
why
this
18-year
period
of
the
states
complying
with
bounds
mainly
with
law
libraries
is
sufficient,
and
it's
because
we
put
people
on
equal
footing
as
to
the
people
who
have
not
committed
crimes
and
who
are
not
in
prison.
and
then,
what
they
can
do
on
the
outside,
if
a
person
is
illiterate,
if
a
person
doesn't
speak
english,
and
they
live
in
phoenix
but
they
haven't
committed
a
crime,
they
haven't
murdered
anybody,
they're
not
incarcerated,
if
they
have
a
1983
case
they
can
go
to
the
law
library,
public
library.
if
they
can't
use
it
because
of
their
own
personal
deficiencies,
they
can
use
family,
friends,
they
can
try
to
get
a
lawyer,
they
can
use
prisoner
groups,
and
we
facilitate
that
in
arizona.
we
allow
them
to
do
all
of
those
sort
of
things
so
they
are
not
disadvantaged,
and
that's
the
point
behind
bounds.
mr.
grant
woods
what
we
can
do,
justice--
mr.
grant
woods
--it's
not
formalistic
in
this
sense.
the
affirmative
duty
that
we
have
is
to
provide
a
law
library.
however,
we
also
have
an
obligation,
from
johnson
to
wolff
and
beyond,
not
to
place
barriers
to
the
prisoners
so
that
they
can't
access
lawyers,
prison
groups--
mr.
grant
woods
--friends
and
other
inmates.
mr.
grant
woods
justice
souter,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
characterize
it
as
an
affirmative
obligation.
it's
an
obligation
not
to
interfere
with
that
right
of
the
prisoner.
mr.
grant
woods
yes.
mr.
grant
woods
that's
correct.
well--
mr.
grant
woods
--i
would--
mr.
grant
woods
--correct.
mr.
grant
woods
that
person
may
live
in
phoenix
and
have
not
committed
a
crime,
and
we
wouldn't
have
an
obligation
to
him
either.
i
would
point
out--
mr.
grant
woods
--no.
i--
[laughter]
again,
this
court
can
decide
this
case
based
upon
what
arizona
does,
and
we
do...
we
move
far
beyond
the
requirements
of
bounds,
all
of
the
things
that
we
do,
but
you
don't--
mr.
grant
woods
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
we
don't
have
to
pay--
mr.
grant
woods
--the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
we
do
not
find
any
systemic
violation.
he...
and
to
answer
the
cost
question
first,
it's
extremely
costly,
and
this
order
would
be...
would
basically
break
the
bank
in
most
of
the
states,
and
i
don't
think
i'm
exaggerating
there.
we
don't
have
the
pay
for
the
actual
phone
call
because
they
call
collect,
but
we
have
to
escort
prisoners
to
and
from
these
phone
calls.
we
have
to...
we'll
have
to
install
extra
phone
lines.
we'd
have
to
hire
extra
guards.
california,
for
example,
we're
talking
about
almost
20
million
calls
per
year
of
a
20-minute
length
that
they
would
have
to
somehow
facilitate,
and
remember,
the
judge
said
that
if
nobody
answers
or
if
they
don't
accept
the
call,
that
doesn't
count.
it's
just
totally
impractical,
and
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
prison
administrators
themselves
should
be
able
to
do.
mr.
grant
woods
justice
stevens,
i
would
apply
the
turner
analysis
here,
because
we
do
not
allow
them
simply
to
walk
up
and
use
the
phone,
because
again,
most
of
the
calls--
mr.
grant
woods
--there's
no
evidence
of
a
systemic
violation,
because
what
we
found
was
that
there
were
a...
i
think
there
were
two
inmates
who
said
that
their
confidentiality
was
violated
because
they
asked
the
guard
to
leave
the
room
and
he
wouldn't.
the
guard
testified
differently,
but
he
believed
the
prisoner.
mr.
grant
woods
i
don't
believe
you
have
that.
again,
arizona
i
think
goes
beyond
what
it
needs
to
do
in
that
we
allow
them
to
do
that.
we
do
encourage...
we
encourage
them
to
confer
by
mail.
mr.
grant
woods
well,
the
basic
approach
is
that
you
should
simply
reverse
it
because
there
is
no
evidence
of--
mr.
grant
woods
--that's
correct.
now,
again,
falling
back
from
that,
if
you
didn't
want
to
do
that
you
could
simply--
mr.
grant
woods
--well,
i
think
what
we
tried
to
point
out
when
we
talked
about
injury
in
the
brief
is
that,
again,
going
back
to
jenkins
and
dayton,
city
of
los
angeles
v.
lyons
where
one,
two
or
three
instances
when
they
find
that,
that's
not
evidence
that
we
need
systemic
relief,
and
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
we
need
systemic
relief.
unless
you
feel
that
bounds
needs
to
be
dramatically
expanded--
mr.
grant
woods
--oh,
yes,
that's
correct.
they
were
verbatim
what
were
submitted
to
him.
his
factual
findings
are
difficult
to
discern
because
they
are--
mr.
grant
woods
--the
judge
basically
adopted
the
inmate's
version
of
everything,
the
findings
of
fact
and
the
conclusions
of
law.
mr.
grant
woods
yes.
mr.
grant
woods
well--
mr.
grant
woods
--your
honor,
i
think
regarding
the
lockdown
prisoners,
then
i
believe
there
clearly
we're
not
talking
about
an
inadequate
law
library
or--
mr.
grant
woods
--yes.
mr.
grant
woods
i
understand
that.
that
means,
i
believe,
that
you
go
to
the
turner
analysis
and
you
have
to
see
in
that
case
a
whole
variety
of
things,
and
also,
even
under
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation
of
injury,
you
have
to
find
injury.
you
have
to
find
systemic
injury,
and
there
is
no
injury.
mr.
grant
woods
if
that
was
the
case,
your
honor,
i
think
arizona
would
have
a
bigger
problem,
but
that's
not
the
case,
and
that
is
not
even
what
this
court
found.
mr.
grant
woods
i
think
that--
mr.
grant
woods
--no,
i
don't
make
that
concession.
mr.
grant
woods
once
again,
justice
breyer,
the
reason
i
point
to
first
the
necessity
for
systemic
injury
is
because
the
findings
here
by
the
judge
were
that
many
times...
he
used
the
word
many...
they
had
to
wait
a
long...
longer
period
of
time.
also
he
found,
though,
that
it's
very
clear
the
policy
in
arizona
is
they
get
their
books
within
24
hours.
mr.
grant
woods
often
long
delays,
the
policy
is
24
hours,
and
the
record
shows
from
the
testimony
that
that
is
generally
what
happens.
the
fact
that
sometimes
somewhere
in
a
prison
you
can
find
9
days,
7
days,
the
bureau
of
prisons'
own
policy
from
their
brief
is
3
to
4
days,
and
we're
doing
24
hours.
mr.
grant
woods
well,
we
don't
believe
that...
that
that
is
the
case,
that
the
case
is
that
if
we
provide
a
reasonably
adequate
law
library
that
that's
enough,
and
you
don't
have
to
micromanage
it
from
there.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my--
mr.
grant
woods
--the
answer
is
yes,
we
did,
and
i
think
i...
it
appears
that
the
district
court
judge
simply
had
his
own
version
of
this
expansive
reading
of
bounds
and
never
applied
any
other
test
whatsoever.
mr.
grant
woods
we
don't
believe
you
have
to
do
that,
and
we're
a
little
wary,
frankly,
of
going
back
and--
mr.
grant
woods
--that's
correct.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
grant
woods
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
there
were
no...
there
was
no
showing
of
actual
injury
by
any
lockdown
inmates.
it
wasn't
two.
two
would
not
be
enough
for
a
systemic
remedy,
but
there
were
none.
mr.
grant
woods
this
is
the
question,
justice
breyer.
we
do
not
believe
that
delay
is
actual
injury.
we're
talking
about
whether
somebody
actually
had
a
case
or
a
cause
of
action
somehow
impaired
because
of
delay.
prisoners,
the
one
thing
they
have
in
abundance
is
time,
and
if
it
takes
4
or
5
days
and
they
have
a
statute
of
limitations
of
300
days,
they
are
not
impaired.
secondly,
turner
has
to
be
applied
to
the
lockdown
situation.
that,
i
think,
is
crystal
clear,
that
first
turner
wasn't
applied,
and
if
it
is
applied,
that
there
is
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest
in
saying
that
you
can't
have
an
unlimited
amount
of
books
in
a
cell,
that
you
can't
have
them
for
an
unlimited
amount
of
time,
and
that
our
system,
where...
which
was
place
at
this
time,
and
exhibit
85
shows
that
legal
assistance
would
go
and
help
these
people
if
they
were
illiterate
or
if
they
just
wanted
any
book,
that
that
is
a
reasonable
system,
and
turner
has
to
be
applied
to
lockdown,
and
that
lockdown
situation
isn't
just
in
arizona,
it's
in
every
prison,
and
in
fact
ours
is
better
than
the
bureau
of
prisons.
i
think
the
whole
point
here...
i'd
like
to
conclude
and
ask
the
court
to
consider
what
arizona
has
done
and
what
most
states
has
done
is,
we've
met
your
precedent.
we've
said,
we
have
a
law
library
and
it's
an
adequate
law
library.
a
pock-apart
missing
here
or
there
that
the
judge
pointed
out
does
not
make
it
inadequate.
and
then
we
have
removed
any
barriers
for...
caused
by
incarceration,
as
dictated
by
johnson
and
by
wolff.
if
you
can't
speak
english
on
the
outside,
you
try
to
get
help
from
whoever
you
can
get
help
from.
we
provide
that
on
the
inside.
we
go
above
and
beyond
that,
and
i
think
that
is
the
key
point,
and
that's
why
we
ask
you
to
reverse.
mr.
grant
woods
thank
you,
your
honor.
