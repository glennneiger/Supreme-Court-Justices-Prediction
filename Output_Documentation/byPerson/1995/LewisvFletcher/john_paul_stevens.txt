justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
specific
question?
we're
talking
in
general
terms
here.
you
mentioned
earlier
about
the
large
number
of
phone
calls
that
have
to
be
made.
as
i
understand,
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
those
calls,
do
you?
if
i
understood
the
district
judge,
he
said
they
could
call
collect
or
pay
for
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
problem
is...
and
is
it
not
also
true
that
he
made
findings
that
the
prisoners
had
been
arbitrarily
denied
access
to
their
attorneys
over
the
phone,
and
do
you
question
those
findings?
i'm
really
asking
you
whether
you
think
there
was
any
violation
at
all
here
justifying
any
relief,
or
are
we
just
talking
about
the
scope
of
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
again,
what
i'm
really
trying
to
find
out,
let's
assume
that
maybe
he's
ordered
too
many
phone
calls.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
he
had
no
authority
to
order
any
phone
calls,
that
there
was
no
violation
of
their
rights
of
access
to
their
lawyers
by
the
way
in
which
the
prisons
restricted
and
listened
in
on
the
calls,
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
that,
but
are
you
saying
there
was
no
evidentiary
basis
for
a
finding
of
violation
of
constitutional
rights
in
denying
adequate
use
of
the
phone?
it
maybe
should
have
been
much
less
than
they
allowed,
but
are
you
saying
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
violation
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
again,
i'm
trying
to
figure
out,
are
you
asking
that
the
entire
decree
be
vacated
and
the
complaint
be
dismissed
because
there's
no
proof
of
any
violation,
or
are
you
merely
arguing,
as
i
thought
you
were,
that
he
overreached
in
a
lot
of
the
provisions
of
the
decree
and
we
should
trim
it
back
somewhat?
which
is
the
basic
approach
you
take?
justice
john
paul
stevens
reverse
and
direct
dismissal
of
the
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
most
of
the
argument
in
the
briefs
is
not
about
whether
there
was
a
violation,
but
rather
about
whether
he
was
overly
ambitious
in
the
relief
he
granted.
