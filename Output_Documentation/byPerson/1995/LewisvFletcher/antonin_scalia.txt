justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
say
he'd
be
in
the
same
shape
he
was
in
if
he
was
not
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
friends,
no
library,
no
lawyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
a
bigger
problem?
do
you
concede,
general
woods,
that
a
lockdown
prisoner
is
entitled
to
have
law
books,
even
for
matters
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
collateral
attack
on
his
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
for
matters
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitution,
he's
entitled
to
that
as
one
of
his
basic
needs
like
food,
housing,
shelter,
medical
care,
and
a
lawyer?
is...
you've
made
that
concession?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that--
--ms.
alexander--
--i
thought
that
the
claim
was
they
had
no
opportunity
to,
that
they
were
given
simply
the
choice
of
deciding...
of
saying
why
the
previous
order
that
had
been
applied
more
narrowly
shouldn't
be
expanded
state-wide.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
inaccurate?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
too
late
to
ask
for
that
when
the
judge
summons
you
up
and
says,
tell
me
why
this
order
shouldn't
be
applied
state-wide.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
no
excuse.
if
it
should
be
done
that
way,
it
should
be
done
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
punish
the
state
for
past
defalcations.
i
can't
imagine
a
judge
just
whipping
up
an
order
on
his
own
and
submitting
it
to
the
state
without
asking
the
state,
who
knows
a
lot
more
about
running
prisons,
how
to
solve
the
problem.
i
just
can't
imagine
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
purpose
the
access
is
sought,
for
what
purpose
the
access
is
sought,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
if
you
say
for
purposes
of
vindicating
constitutional
rights
taken
away
when
he's
thrown
in
prison,
i
suppose
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you're
talking
about
the
right
to
sue
for
some
monetary
damages,
that's
just
a
deprivation
of
economic
welfare
which
he's
been
deprived
of
that
when
he's
thrown
in
prison.
he
can't
go
out
and
make
money
in
all
sorts
of
ways.
i
don't
see
that
that's
so
fundamental.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
only
one.
i
don't
see
how
the
other
has
anything
to
do
with
fundamental
human
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'd
say
that,
but
that's
a
constitutional
violation
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
giving
you
constitutional
violations,
but
would
you
acknowledge
that
as
far
as
the
obligations
of
the
prison,
they
don't
have
to
give
any
legal
advice
about
anything
that
doesn't
deal
with
constitutional
violations.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
given
the
chance,
as
i
understand,
to
say
why
the
earlier
order,
which
contained
such
a
provision,
should
not
be
applied
state-wide.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
an
opportunity
to
object
to
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
earlier
order.
it
is
simply
an
objection
to
say
why
the
earlier
order
should
be
extended
state-wide.
but
you
know,
i'm
not
even
as
far
along
as
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
know
why
it
shouldn't
be
an
inexorable
requirement.
what
is
wrong
with
an
absolute
requirement
that
before
a
district
judge
decides
how
to
manage
prisons,
he
ought
to
ask
the
state
how
they
think
it
ought
to
be
managed?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
wrong
with
making
that
an
absolute,
universal,
inexorable
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says,
you
have
2
weeks
to
come
up
with
a
plan.
if
you
don't
come
up
within
2
weeks,
i'll
make
up
my
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
use
the
one
i
used,
you
know,
several
years
ago.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
2
weeks
is
a
reasonable
period
and
the
state
comes
up
with
something
that's
patently
absurd,
the
judge
would
say,
well,
i
gave
you
your
chance,
now
i'm
going
to
make
up
one.
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
this
judge
it
would
give
them
something.
ms.
alexander,
let
me
return,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
of
systemic
violation,
and
i'd
like
to
get
some
feel
for
how
you
would
quantify
it.
supposing
there
are
260
prisoners
in
lockdown,
and
a
number
of
them
request
books,
and
say
in
maybe
two
or
three
of
those
examples
the
books
don't
come
within
a
3-day
period
that
the
regulations
require.
now,
is
that
a
systemic
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
all
the
harms--
--ms.
alexander--
--no--
--why
wouldn't
it
satisfy
the
constitution
if
prisoners
were
allowed
to
file
whatever
they
want
to
file
and
provided
access
to
forms
so
that
they
could
file,
and
secondly,
they
were
also
provided
access
to
legal
advice,
period?
no
books,
no
anything
else.
they
have
the
forms,
you
fill
out
a
form,
we'll
mail
it
for
you,
and
moreover,
you
can
have
legal
advice
about
any
particular
issues
you
want
to
discuss,
any
particular
constitutional
issues
you
want
to
discuss,
maltreatment
in
prison,
your
conviction
was
void
for
some
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
add
that,
that
legal
advice
and
the
lawyer
will
fill
out
the
form
for
you
if
you
can't
write.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
would
be
good,
and
you
could
get
rid
of
the
library.
