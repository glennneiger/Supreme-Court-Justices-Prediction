ms.
elizabeth
alexander
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
start
trying
to
talk
systematically
about
this
case,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
few
of
the
questions
from
general
woods'
discussion.
first,
i
think
the
basic
finding
here
was
that
the
vast
majority
of
adult
prisoners
have
no
adequate
means
to
research
and
present
their
papers
in
court,
and
that
was
made
up
specific
findings
and
a
number
of
elements.
how
the
lockdown
system...
the
system
as
to
how
the
great
majority
of
prisoners
actually
got
the
books
from
the
library,
inability
to
use
them,
how
the
staffing
worked
in
the
system,
how
the
law
clerks,
who,
by
the
way,
have
no
role
in
research,
worked,
how
the
supposed
one
source
of
legal
assistance
worked,
that
is
the
prisoner
legal
assistance,
and
what
the
sources
for
illiterate
and
spanish-speaking
prisoners
were.
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
in
the
defendants'
reply
brief
they
said
that
they
were
not
challenging
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
as
clearly
erroneous,
and
i
want
to
further
point
out
that
a
number
of
the
findings,
and
these
actually
from
the
district
court,
if
one
goes
back,
both
parties
submitted
findings,
a
number
of
the
findings
actually
came
from
defendants.
i
want
to
further
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
order...
that
the
record
supports
a
claim
that
the
state
asked
for
some
different
form
of
developing
the
remedy.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
anything
at
all
that
would
support
that.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
but--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--they
never
asked
for
anything
else.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
so,
because
they
had
five
opportunities
to
say
anything
in
this
order
is
not
correct,
and
any--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--not
in
that
form,
but
i
don't
think--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--yes,
but
that
did
not
limit
in
any
manner--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--justice
o'connor,
that
is
a
common--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--excuse
me,
justice
ginsburg,
my
apologies.
that
is
a
usual
way
of
doing
this.
however,
the
factual
history
in
this
is
that
they
had
originally
in
the
gluth
case
completely
failed
to
cooperate
in
any
manner
with
the
district
court.
that
order
then
went
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
was
affirmed--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--but
certainly--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--well,
i
think
the...
this
was
an
injunction
that
was
running
in
one
of
the
institutions,
and
it...
there's
nothing
that
the
state
lost
by
this
process,
nothing
at
all.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
your
honor--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
would
certainly
agree
that
there
is
no
place
anywhere
in
the
court's
findings
in
the
district
court
in
which
it
says,
here
i
am
applying
the
turner
analysis
and
here
is
what
i
find.
i--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--your
honor,
if
i
could
take
that
apart
just
a
bit,
i
agree
that
the
noise
provision
goes
too
far,
and
i
have
no
problem
with
just
simply
getting
rid
of
it,
but
the
claim
that
somehow
it
prohibits
their
lockdown
system
and
requires
lockdown
prisoners
to
get
direct
access
to
the
books
is
just
not
correct.
it's
very
clear
in
the
commentary
that
that
was
never
what
the
judge
or
the
special
master
intended,
and
if
there's
any--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--but
it
is
completely
clear
from
the
commentary,
and
if
the
court
has
any
question
about
that,
we
also
have
no
objection
to
a
modification
to
make
that
absolutely
clear.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes,
and
i--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--if
i
could
go
on
to
explain
my
answer
on
that--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
believe
that
if
one
looks
at
how
the
district
court
treated
those
things
and
in
fact
left,
for
example,
the
lockdown
provisions
in
place
means
that
in
effect
turner
was
applied.
now,
in
terms
of
the
relationship
between
turner--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
would
agree.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
the
relationship
between
bounds
and
any
affirmative
obligation
in
the
prison
context
case,
whether
personal
safety
or
whatever,
is
there's
an
obligation
to
provide
that.
however,
that
doesn't
mean
that
regulations
that
have
some
incidental
effect
on
something
that's
an
affirmative
obligation,
therefore
cannot
be
put
in
place
on
the
state,
so
if
there
is
something
that
both
has
turner
implications--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--actually
i
think
estelle,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
a
good
illustration
of
how
this
principle
works,
because
there
is
no
obligation
for
the
person
who's
bleeding
on
the
street
for
the
state
to
do
something
because
the
state
hasn't
been
involved
in
that.
but
there
is
an
affirmative
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
provide
medical
care
for
the
person
who
is
in
its
custody.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
well,
it
has
to
provide
reasonable
medical
care,
just
as
it
has
to
provide
reasonable
safety.
that
is
the
affirmative
obligation.
that
is
the
obligation
that's
not--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
in
bounds--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--in
bounds
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
right
of
access
to
courts
is
the
most
fundamental
right
that
a
prisoner
has,
because
no
other
right,
including
eighth
amendment
rights,
can--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--yes.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
i
agree
that
the
most
fundamental
core
of
the
right
of
access
to
courts
has
to
do
with
those
things
related
to
the
criminal
process.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
well,
civil
rights
under
section
1983
i
would
think
is
equally
fundamental,
because
if
that
doesn't
exist,
then
absolutely
nothing
that
the
prison
authorities
do
to
the
person
while
in
prison
can
be
redressed.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
i
would
agree,
your
honer,
and
those--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
think
that
is
more
debatable.
however,
custody
rights
are...
also
relate
to
a
fundamental
interest,
and
immigration
is
in
fact
so
closely
tied
to
the
criminal
process--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
think
that
it
is
not
beyond
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
collateral
to
the
criminal
justice
rights
because
they
are
so
closely
related.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
well,
there
are
a
number
of--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--your
honor,
a
number
of
detainer
issues
with
regard
to
immigration
also
have
effects
on
the
criminal
justice
system.
however,
i
would
think
that
in
the
overall
context
this
is
not
nearly
as
important.
almost
all
of
the
access
that's
here
involved
in
this
case
has
to
do
with
the
two
fundamental
things
that
justice
scalia
mentioned,
that
is,
the
direct
relation
to
the
criminal
justice
process
and
civil
rights.
that--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--your
honor,
i
can't
answer
the
question
directly
in
that
form.
what
i
can
say,
but
i
can't
give
the
court
citations,
is
that
the
studies
of
effective
legal
access
program
show
that
the
effect
of
the
program
is
to
reduce
the
filing
of
frivolous
lawsuits.
the
volume
goes
down,
because
once
prisoners
have
some
opportunity
to
know
what
are
the
requirements
of--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--that
may
be,
but
those
are
still
extraordinarily
important
cases,
because
without
some
access
to
the
courts,
then
there
is
no
possible
limit
on
governmental
power.
these
are
the
people
who
have
the...
in
which
there
is
the
most
possibility
of
abuse
of--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--there
has
to
be
a
threat
of
injury
to
the
class,
or
some
defined
portion
of
the
class.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
well,
in
terms
of
the
argument
that
the
defendants
have
made,
the--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--the
class--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--the...
they
must
prove
that
this
entire
system
as
directed
to
this
element
poses
a
real
and
immediate
threat
to
the
likes
of
access
of
the
class.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
well--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--well,
justice
breyer,
bounds
says
also
that
it's
a
due
process
right.
i
notice
that
turner
v.
satley
describes
johnson
v.
avery,
the
earlier
right
of
access
case,
as
involving
a
first
amendment
petition
right.
i
think
the
reason
that
one
could
describe
it
best
as
a
due
process
right
is
that
it
has
various
elements.
it
has
elements
of
equal
protection.
it
has
elements,
for
a
person
who
has
already
been
convicted,
of
petitions
to
redress
grievances,
and
for
those
reasons
i
have
no
quarrel
with
bounds'
description
of
it
as
a
due
process
right.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
if
the
court
were
of
the
view
that
a
constitutional
violation
had
been
proven
but
was
concerned
that
certain
aspects,
subsidiary
aspects
of
the
remedy
did
not
appropriately
consider
the
turner
analysis,
the
appropriate
relief,
i
would
think,
would
be
to
remand
it
to
the
ninth
circuit
with
directions
to
remand
to
the
district
court
to
determine
what
provisions
should
have
a
turner
analysis
then
applied.
i'd
like
to--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--justice
ginsburg,
it
seems
to
me
that
that...
it
would
be
wrong
to
apply
a
flat-out
rule
that
no
district
court
can
ever
enter
structural
relief
without
first
giving
a
defendant,
no
matter
how
recalcitrant,
no
matter
what
the
history--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
one
can
look
at
the
record,
one
can
look
at
what
happened
in
gluth,
one
can
look
at
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
any
books
that
were
not
on
the
so-called
michie
list
were
then
immediately
removed
from
the
law
library,
one
can
look
at
the
finding
of
the
special
master
in
the
development
of
the
process
that
there
had
been
retaliatory
practices
at
some
of
the
facilities,
and
that's
in
the--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
think
it
would
be
different,
your
honor,
if
the
court
were
now
to
tell
district
judges
there
is
such
a
rule,
but
to
apply
retroactively
in
this
case
a
rule
that
a
district
judge
who
gave
the
defendants
8
months
and
five
sets
of
objections
during
which...
and
many
informal
meetings
with
the
special
master,
and
in
which
many,
many,
if
not
most
of
the
defendant's
objections
were
accommodated...
indeed,
the
only
reason,
for
example,
that
the
noise
provision,
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
supreme
court
the
defendants
objected
to,
is
in
there,
is
at
no
earlier
point
did
the
defendants
say,
we
don't
want
it.
there
ought
to
be
some
obligation
on
the
part
of
state--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--and
had
they
taken
that
opportunity
it
would
have
been
out
of
there,
because,
in
fact,
i
would...
there
was--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--it
fail--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--it
fails
to
account
for
the
circumstance
that
if
the
defendants
are
not
going
to
cooperate
the
district
court
is
going
to
be
forced
to
delay
the
imposition
of
consti--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--your
honor--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
think
that
suggests
some
of
the
practical
difficulties.
if
the
state,
in
fact,
had
been
given
2
weeks
to
come
up
with
a
plan,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
what
it
would
have
been
able
to
submit
in
that
time
would
have
been
less
responsive
to
its
interest
than
the
8-month
period
it
had--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--if
that
is
actually
what
the
rule
of
the
court
were,
it
would
be
a
rule
that
wouldn't
really
give
the
state
and
local
defendants
anything
that
they
now
don't
have,
because
it
wouldn't
be...
it
would
be
just
a
formality.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i...
let
me
say
that
that's
not
this
case.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
obviously,
one
can't
give
a
hard
and
fast
rule,
but
i
think
the
key
here
is
looking,
is
this
the
way,
based
on
what
you
know
about
the
system,
that...
does
this
represent
isolated
events
or
is,
based
on
what
the
system
is
supposed
to
do,
is
this
what
is
to
be
expected?
this
is
a
case
in
which
what
the
evidence
showed
how
the
system
was
working
was
exactly
how
one
would
expect
a
system
to
work.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
your
honor,
if
i
could
say
again--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--there...
i
think
there
is
more
evidence.
that's
what
the
district
judge
cited.
there
is
more
evidence
in
the
record,
particularly
from
the
transcripts,
about
that,
but--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--yes,
because--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--well,
first,
your
honor,
i
think
the
right
is...
of
access
is
violated
whether
or
not
the
prisoner
would
ultimately
succeed
if
the
prisoner
was
denied
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
present
his
or
her
claims
to
court,
and
certainly
there
was
testimony
with
regard
to
the
lockdown
system
that
that
happened.
there
were
prisoners
who
were
unable
to
get
the
books,
who
were
unable
to
find,
figure
out--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--there
is
a
right
of
access
to
determine,
your
honor,
whether
there
is
a
ground
to
file
a
case,
and
certainly
that's
what
we
would
want
prisoners
to
do.
we
would
want
prisoners
to
be
able
to
determine
before
they
file
whether
or
not
what
they're
filing
is
a
frivolous
case,
and
there
certainly
was
evidence
that
this
system
with
regard
to
the
one
book
delivered
to
the
cell
with
nothing
to
tell
the
prisoner
that
he
wants
or
she
wants
volume
452
of
fed
2d--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--of...
of
how
the...
whether
the
law...
yes,
there
is
evidence.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
there's
evidence
that
that's
how
it
normally
worked,
that
it
normally
took
a
long
time.
what
the--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--there
is
evidence--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--there
is
evidence
that
those
persons
who
didn't
get
it
were
not
able
to
file
cases
and
were...
and
had
their
cases
dismissed
because
they
were
unable
to
make
responses
in
conformity
with
the
order,
and
your
honor,
i
would
submit--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--your
honor,
that
is
a
misunderstanding
that
the
defendants
first
put
forward
in
their
reply
brief.
if
one
looks
at
the
findings
of
the
district
court
on
this
point,
it's
not
that
there
were
two
incidents,
it
is
that
prisoners,
plural,
were
unable
to
file
their
cases.
prisoners,
plural,
had
their
cases
dismissed.
now,
it
is
the
case
that
the
judge
cites
on
this
only
one
witness
for
each,
but
that
certainly
is
not
what
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed.
there
were
numerous
other
witnesses
who
testified
to
similar
events,
and
i
could
go
through
them.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
your
honor,
i
believe
that
he
did
make
systemic
findings,
and
given
that
the
defendants
specifically
say
in
their
reply
brief
we
are
not
challenging
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
as
clearly
erroneous,
i
think
this
issue
is
at
an
end.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
well,
i
think
what
i
would
see
as
the
missing
step
in
this,
the
two,
we
disagree,
that's
not
what's
involved,
but
in
any
event,
these
are
cases
in
which
someone
had
actually
had
his
or
her
constitutional
rights
impaired,
but
the
question
the
district
judge
ought
to
be
addressing
is
a
different
one,
is
there
threatened
injury
from
the
class
when
i
see
that
these
harms
have
occurred,
that
this
same
system
is
operating
the
way
i
would
expect
this
flawed
system
to
operate,
and
therefore--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--for
some
prisoners
that
might
well
provide
meaningful
access,
but
for
a
prisoner
who
cannot
write,
the
opportunity
to
be
given
legal
advice
and
to
be
given
form
books
just
doesn't
work

in
fact,
i
would
say
that
the
best
systems
are
those
systems
that
rely
on
something
like
that,
rely
on
using
direct
sources
of
assistance.

oh,
absolutely.
we
have
no
attachment
to
law
libraries.
personally,
i
think
law
libraries
are
not
the
best
way
to
provide
access,
but
in
some
sense
what
bounds
does
here
is
helpful,
because
it
gives
us
something
to
measure
access
by.
does
the
prisoner
have
the
access
that
is
equivalent
to
what
a
literate
prisoner
given
access
to
a
law
library
would
have?
that
ought
to
be
the
appropriate
standard.
thank
you,
your
honor.
