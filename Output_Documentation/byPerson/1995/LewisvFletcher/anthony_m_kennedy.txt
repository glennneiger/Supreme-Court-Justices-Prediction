mr.
woods,
attorney
general
woods--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
you
give
consideration,
or
have
any
of
the
people
who
have
written
in
this
field
in
the
scholarly
community
given
any
consideration
to
whether
or
not
the
library
requirement
makes
sense
at
all?
it
seems
to
me
that
maybe
libraries
might
be
a
waste,
and
that
there
might
be
much
better,
more
efficient
ways
in
which
to
provide
prisoners
some
assistance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
asking
whether
or
not
other
forms
of
legal
assistance
were
considered
by
you.
it
seems
to
me
you're
defending
your
position,
advancing
your
position
on
the
theory
that
your
library
facilities
were
adequate.
you
have
not
taken
the
position,
i
take
it,
and
have
any
other
prisoners,
prison
systems
taken
the
position,
that
the
library
requirement
is
just
fanciful,
what
prisoners
need
are
small
books
with
forms
and
a
couple
of
people
to
tell
them
how
to
fill
them
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
says
other
forms--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
legal
assistance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
there
been
any
studies
on
the
effectiveness
of
prison
libraries?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
general
woods,
isn't
it
inevitable
that
if
the
state
takes
the
position
that
it's
going
to
comply
with
bounds
by
having
a
library
system,
that
you're
going
to
get
decrees
like
this?
if
i
were
a
district
judge,
and
i
read
the
requirement
of
the
supreme
court
that
you
have
to
have
a
law
library,
the
first
thing
i'd
do
probably
is
make
up
a
list
of
the
books
that
ought
to
be
in
the
law
library,
and
how
often
it
ought
to
be
open,
and
all
we're
doing
is
just
arguing
about
details.
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
accept
the
requirement
of
bounds
that
you
have
an
affirmative
obligation
to
provide
a
library,
we're
going
to
be
talking
up
here...
we
may
disagree
on
exactly
how
long
it
ought
to
be
open,
and
how
much
of
a
delay
is
acceptable,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
the
district
judge
is
essentially
correct
in
most
of
what
he
said
if
there's
an
affirmative
obligation
to
provide
a
library.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
incidentally,
where
does
that
affirmative
obligation
come
from?
i
understand
the
sick
prisoner
case.
that
comes
from
the
eighth
amendment.
this
isn't
an
eighth
amendment
case,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
where
does
this
affirmative
obligation
to
provide
a
law
library
come
from?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
than
bounds.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's--
--did
any
of
those
instances
indicate
that
there
was
a
real
danger
of
a
constitutional
right
being
sacrificed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
being
impaired?
what
was
one
of
those?
having
in
mind
that
only
1
percent
of
prisoner
petitioners
are
successful
anyway,
where
in
one
of
these
is
there
a
real
threat
of
a
constitutional
right,
in
a
concrete
sense,
being
deprived?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
there's
a
right
of
access
even
if
you
don't
have
a
ground
for
a
complaint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
no
evidence
of
the
efficacy
of
that
system,
is
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
no,
there's
no
evidence
that
there's
some
demonstrated
link
between
access
to
library
materials
and
successful
prisoner
petitions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
contrasted
with
simply
filing
the
form
that's
prescribed
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
