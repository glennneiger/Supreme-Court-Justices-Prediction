o'connor
mr.
woods,
what
are
the
findings
of
the
district
court
that
would
support
a
system-wide
violation
of
bounds?
was
there
any
express
finding
that
there
was
a
system-wide
violation
of
the
requirements
this
court
set
forth
in
bounds?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
take
the
position
that
bounds
was
an
either-or
situation,
that
the
state
can
provide
a
library
or
assistance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
do
that,
i
certainly
think
there
is
some
indication
that
a
prisoner
who
cannot
read
or
who
does
not
speak
english
might
not
have
meaningful
access
to
a
library
even
if
it
were
there,
and
you
want
us
to
take
the
position
that
there's
no
requirement
to
provide
any
assistance
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
the
meaning
of
bounds,
because
there
certainly
is
language
in
it
that
speaks
in
terms
of
meaningful
access,
do
you
have
a
fallback
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
want
us
to
find
that
the
district
court
findings
were
erroneous?
i
mean,
what
is
it
we're
supposed
to
do,
parse
through
the
record
and
say
that
their
findings
were
clearly
erroneous?
what
is
it
you're
asking
us
to
do,
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
don't
make
an
argument,
then,
today,
that
the
injunction
exceeded
the
scope
of
the
district
court's
authority?
you're
not
making
that
argument,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
submitted
by
whom?
what
are
you
talking
about?
i
don't
even
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
the
loss
of
any
turner
analysis
in
this
thing?
i
mean,
in
the
turner
case,
this
court
indicated
that
prisoners'
claims
of
constitutional
violations
have
to
be
viewed
through
some
kind
of
a
lens
of
deference
to
the
needs
for
prison
security
and
so
forth,
and
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record
that
i
have
found
of
any
turner-type
analysis
by
the
district
court
in
deciding
to
issue
the
order
and
injunction
that
it
did
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
point
me
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
breadth
of
the
detailed
orders
is
breathtaking.
it
has
to
do
with
the
noise
levels
in
these
places,
and
hours
of
operation,
and
no
deference
to
the
prison's
need
for
lockdown
or
security.
i
mean,
it's
just...
it
really
is
breathtaking
in
its
scope.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
not
clear
from
the
language
of
the
injunction,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
alexander,
may
i
ask
you
to
focus
for
a
minute
on
what
you
say
the
injury
is
that
must
be
proven
for
a
system-wide
violation
that
would
justify
a
system-wide
decree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
constitutional
injury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
this
context,
what
do
you
say
has
to
be
established
to
justify
system-wide
relief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
in
terms
of
what
you
say
the
class
representatives
must
prove--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
get
system-wide
relief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
instances
of
that
were
found?
was
it
two?
