justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
reading
out
the
word,
interim?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
mean
interim
as
between
two
periods
of
active
duty?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
have
a
definition
in
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry,
i'm
just
not
getting
it.
i'm
sure
somewhere
they
use
that
phrase,
but
how
are
you
connecting
that
with
the
meaning
of
the
word?
justice
david
h.
souter
interim.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
may
have
done
it,
but
is
there
a
house
or
a
senate
report
that
defines
the
term,
or
indicates--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
it
on
duty
time,
as
it
is
in
justice
scalia's
omaha
wait.
why
is
he
on
duty
in
omaha
but
not
on
duty
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
road?
justice
david
h.
souter
he's
at
rest
on
the
side
of
the
road.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
he's
on
duty,
so
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
is,
he's
on
duty.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
treated
as
on-duty
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
going
back
to
your
claim
that
in
fact
they're
really
being
required
to
do
something.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
answer
is
inconsistent
with
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
going
to
win
in
front
of
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
true,
then
under
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion,
you're
going
to
win,
ultimately.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
can
go
back
to
the
seventh
circuit,
or
the
district
court
under
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
and
say,
aha,
they
have
responsibilities,
then
you're
going
to
win.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
the
whole
point
of
our
taking
this
case
is
not
to
decide
whether
you
win
or
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
that
hypothesis.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
they
get
paid
for
the
limbo
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
do
they
mind?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
still
have
to
have
the
off
duty.
they
have
to
have
the
off-duty
hours
after
the
limbo
time
plus
the
transportation
is
over.
they
have
to
have
the
10
off-duty
hours
anyway.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
does
it
become...
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
no,
but
i
mean,
why
is
it
a
safety
problem
if
when
they
get
back
they
still
have
to
have
the
10
hours?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
the
only
difficulty
i
have
with
your
response
is,
i
mean,
you're
relying
on
legislative
history
for
part
of
the
answer,
but
when
we
get
to
drawing
the
distinction
between
the
waiting
time
and
the
transportation
time,
and
you're
saying
well,
congress
bought
that
distinction,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
you
were
previously
relying
on
that
supports
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
seems...
it
just
strikes
me
as
odd
that
when
they
adopted,
in
effect,
the
compromise
which
are
the...
when
they
adopted
the
language
following
but,
in
what
is
now
(4),
it
just
strikes
me
as
odd,
if
we're
going
to
rely
on
legislative
history,
to
find
that
there
is
no
explanation
of
what
you're
telling
us.
why
might
they
not
have
said,
well,
we're
going
to
add
these
words
following
but,
and
we're
going
to
put
them
in
(4),
but
that
does
not
affect
the
question
of
how
we're
going
to
treat
waiting
time,
because
waiting
time
is
subject
to
abuse.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
record
that
addresses
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
the
abuse
argument?
there's
no...
the
railroads
weren't
engaging
in
abuses
while
they
were
transporting.
they
were
engaging
in
abuses
by
being
very
unsystematic
and
uncaring
about
getting
the...
doing
the
transportation.
i
think
that's
his
argument.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
didn't
draw
any
distinction,
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
problem
congress
had
was
a
unified
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
wish
to
go
outside
it.
i
just
wondered
whether
there
was
anything
in
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
didn't
you
then...
i
mean,
if
you
still
persisted,
i
mean,
why
isn't
the
answer,
that
is,
if
you
still
persisted
in
thinking
the
other
view
the
better
one,
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
worth
the
government's
while
at
least
to
persist
in
one
other
circuit
to
get
a
conflict
and
get
the
thing
up
here?
