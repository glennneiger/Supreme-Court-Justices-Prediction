mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
obvious
question
for
you
to
ask
me
this
morning
is,
if
congress
intended
for
waiting
time
for
deadhead
transportation
to
be
time
on
duty,
why
didn't
it
say
so
specifically?
well,
the
answer
to
that,
at
least
in
my
mind,
is
very
simple.
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
first
of
all
encompasses
many
train
operations.
even
the
petitioners
acknowledge
that
there
are
thousands
of
train
operations
daily.
at
the
time
of
the
'69
statute,
there
were
36,000
train
operations
each
day,
so--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--meaning,
a
crew
goes
on
duty
and
performs
service
for
the
railroad.
that
would
be
one
train
operation,
your
honor.
and
the
other
answer
to
that
is,
and
i
think
it's
the
real
guts
of
the
case
is,
there
was
no
need
to
specifically
state
that
waiting
time
was
time
on
duty
because
congress
treated
that
issue
in
several
sections
of
the
statute,
and
i
refer
the
court
to
section
21103(b),
and
i
will
talk
about
(1),
(2),
(3),
(4),
(5),
and
(6)
subsections.
and
in
each
one
of
those
subsections
it's
very
clear
that
congress
was
attempting...
and
i
submit
to
you
they
did
close
the
loopholes,
and
one
basic
problem
is
that
railroad
workers
at
that
period
of
time
were
sitting
on
trains
for
hours
on
end
waiting
for
a
pickup
crew
or
another
train
to
come
along
and
take
them
to
their
final
release
period,
and
it's...
throughout
the
entire
amendments
the
sole
purpose
was
to
close
those
loopholes,
and
they
did
it
in
several
ways.
first
of
all,
you
don't
have
to
be
working
at
all
to
be
covered
as
time
on
duty
under
the
act,
because
it's
very
clear...
you
know,
i'm
just
a
country
boy,
your
honors,
but
english
is
english.
it
says,
interim
periods
available
for
rest
at
a
place--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
this
is
section
21103--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--in
my
brief,
your
honor,
it
is...
yes,
page
2
of
the
petition.
page
3,
number
(5),
subsection
(5),
your
honor,
an
interim
period
available
for
rest.
now,
what
the
carriers
and
the
government
is
telling
you
is
that
this
period
of
time
should
not
be
considered
here.
they
want
to
write
out
and
put
conditions
on
each
section,
not
giving
it
its
broad
and
plain
meaning.
they--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--the
interim,
justice
souter,
means
interim
between
the
time
you
go
on
duty
and
the
time
that
you're
finally
released
from
duty.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
we
have
some
legislative
history.
in
the
hearings,
as
well
as
in
the
senate
report,
it
talks
about
final
release
of
all...
finally
released
from
all
responsibilities.
the
proof
of
the
pudding
there
is--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
interim--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--interim
means,
as
discussed
in
the
house
hearings
and
the
industry
spokesman,
the
association
of
american
railroads,
made
that
point
clear,
your
honor,
if
i--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--it
does
not
define
the
term.
congress--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--it...
i
submit
it
doesn't
hurt
my
position.
it
includes
periods
for
operations.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
somewhat,
but
i
don't
think
it's
definitive,
because
as
the
railroad...
the
chief
railroad
witness,
and
i
think
it's
very
critical,
testified,
and
i
refer
to
the
house
hearings
at
page
135,
where
mr.
manion...
mr.
manion
was
the
vice
president
of
the
association
of
american
railroads,
and
he
was
talking
about
the
problems
of
deadheading
transportation
and
what
would
happen
if
the
bill
as
was
introduced
were
adopted,
and
after
he
discussed
that
part,
he
said,
however,
under
another
provision
of
h.r.
8449,
which
is
the
section
dealing
with
interim
periods
for
rest,
section
1(b)(3)...
now,
that
is
exactly
the
same
as
what
was
passed,
subsection
(5),
and
i
quote:
periods
available
for
rest
at
other
than
a
designated
terminal
will
be
included
as
time
on
duty.
consequently,
if
a
crew
reaches
the
hours-of-service
limit
in
the
country
and
is
relieved
there,
it
will
still
be
on
duty
for
purposes
of
hours-of-service
purposes
because
it
is
not
relieved
at
a
designated
terminal.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
except,
your
honors,
this
was
an
industry
spokesman,
the
association
of
american
railroads,
on
a
bill
that
only
affected
them,
and
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
is
to
close
all
these
loopholes,
and
i
submit
to
you,
this
statement
as
far
as
i
am
concerned--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
the
act
solely--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--no,
your
honor.
the
act
solely
deals
with
placing
in
the
act
periods
of
time
that
not...
that
previously
were
not
time
on
duty
as
being
time
on
duty,
with
one
exception,
deadhead
transportation
to
the
final
release
point.
everything
else
that
they
did,
the
congress
made
it
time
on
duty
to
eliminate
every
abuse
that
was
testified
to
in
these
hearings,
and
this
is
the
industry
spokesman.
now,
you
can
look
at
the
hearings,
and
i
spent
some
time
doing
that,
to
see
what
all
the
rest
of
the
witnesses
stated
from
the
industry.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes,
there
is.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
that's--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that's
one
of
the
issues.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
two
things,
justice
breyer.
one
is,
of
course,
the
industry,
how
they
dealt
with
deadhead
transportation,
and
here's
how
they
define
it...
mr.
manion
again.
deadheading
may
be
defined
as
travel
performed
by
railroad
employees
at
the
direction
of
a
railroad.
now,
he
was
not
the
only
railroad
witness.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
there
are
three
things.
one
is
commingled
service,
which
is
defined
in
the
statute
as
any
other
service
for
the
carrier.
you
are
part
of
the
crew.
you're
not
free
to
leave
the
premises
except
being
under
the
control
and
subject
to
being
called,
and
you're
not
finally
released
from
duty
until
you
get
back
at
the
terminal
and
do
other
ministerial
duties.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
all
time...
all
time--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--you
are
on
duty.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
you're
on
duty.
that's
specifically
in
the
statute.
from
the
time
you
mark
on
duty,
and
that's
subsection
(4)
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--deadheaded
transportation
back,
at
the
end
of
your
tour
of
duty,
at
the
end
of
your
tour--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--of
operations--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--okay.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it's
all
commingled
service,
and
it's
also
time
that
is
free
for
rest,
and
under
the
statute,
that's
on-duty
time.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that
is
not,
because
of
the
statutory
provision.
that's
why
congress
carved
out
this
one
exception.
the
only
exception
is
that
it
will
not
be
counted
as
time
on
duty,
nor
time
off
duty.
that
one
period
of
actual
movement,
traveling
in...
traveling
in
is
the
key.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
because--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
maybe...
maybe
free
at
rest
makes
no
sense
at
all,
either,
but
it
would
create
an
anomaly.
the
anomaly
would
be
this--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--congress
said
so.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
if
congress
had
not
said
that
rest
time
was
time
on
duty,
i
would
agree
with
you,
but
congress
didn't
say
that.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it's
a
good
question,
but
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
way
congress
envisioned
this,
i
would
argue
to
you
that
any
time
that
you're
not
traveling,
and
it's
very
clear
if
you
look
at
the
statute
and
the
meaning
of
the
terms,
if
you're
not
traveling
in
the
deadhead
transportation,
then
it's
either
commingled
service,
you're
performing
other
service--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--when
you're
waiting--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that's
rest
time.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
congress
said
that
an
interim
period
available
for
rest
is
time
on
duty.
you
can
be
at
rest
completely--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--mm-hmm.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
he
doesn't
have
to
be
performing
any
duty.
he
can
simply
be
doing
nothing,
just
sitting
there
waiting,
doing
absolutely
nothing--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--specifically.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
typically,
the
problem...
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
there
hasn't
been
tremendous
abuses.
what
we
have
as
a
typical
situation,
at
the
end
of
the
12
hours
a
crew
is
waiting
and
waiting
and
waiting.
we
have
evidence
in
the
record
that
up
to
10
hours,
sometimes,
they
have
to
wait
for
someone
to
come
and
get
them--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
oh--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
if
you're--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--commingling--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that's
correct.
one
is
the
rest
period,
interim
period
for
rest--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that
is--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--in
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
oh...
oh,
i--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
let
me--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--the
third
is,
what
was
congress
trying
to
do
here?
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
congress
was
trying
to
eliminate
the
abuses,
and
this
was
one
of
the
greatest
abuses
that
the
industry
was
accomplishing.
they
were
leaving
these
crews
out
there
an
inordinate
amount
of
time,
and
they're
still
doing
it
today.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
don't
think
the
agency,
justice
breyer,
has
the
authority
here.
this
is
the
one
statute,
the
only
safety
statute
on
the
books,
in
which
the
federal
railroad
administration
does
not
have
regulatory
authority.
they
enforce,
but
they
have
no
regulatory
authority.
in
fact,
congress
took
away
the
authority.
in
the
old
statute
in
1908,
the
old
statute,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
did
have
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they
can
interpret,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they
did.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
does
in
one
respect,
but
the
other
respect
i
can
just
say,
the
very
opposite
is
true.
going
to
deadhead
trans...
deadhead
to-duty
assignment
obviously
includes
the
time
you
report
to
duty,
and
the
time
you
are
actually
traveling,
because
the
first
subsection
states
very
clearly
that
time
on
duty
begins
when
you
report
for
duty,
so
obviously,
and
i
could
argue
that
if
that
is
time
on
duty
from
the
point
of
reporting
to
duty
and
actually
moving
in
transit,
then
the
opposite
situation
coming
back
is
the
same.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct,
but
the
statute
also
tells
you
that,
unlike
what
the
respondents
are
saying,
it
tells
you
that
you
are
not...
there's...
the
position
of
the
respondents,
simply
put,
is
that
the
employee
is
off-duty,
no
further
obligations,
after
the
12
hours
is
reached.
that's
just
not
the
fact.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
there
are
several--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--answers
to
that.
number
1,
why
would
they
want
just
rest
time
to
be
time
on
duty?
because
there
were
abuses
at
that
time,
and
there
are
still
abuses.
that's
one
reason.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they're
not
required...
justice
souter,
they're
not
required
to
do
anything,
and
they're
off...
i
mean,
and
they're
on
duty,
specifically
by
the
statute,
and
that
was
what
the
industry
spokesmen
were
telling
congress
at
the
time.
congress,
if
you
adopt
this,
we
can
never
let
anyone
off
at
an
interim
point.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they
do.
they
still
do.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
justice
scalia--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
respectfully
differ
with
you
because,
as
i've
pointed
out
in
my
reply
brief,
the
duties
don't
end.
when
you
get
at
the
end--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--sir.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
consider
anything
but
that
one
section
of
subsection
(4),
time
spent
in
deadhead
transportation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they
did
not
look--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
i
can
only
suggest--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
correct,
but
i
think
it
is
significant
in
that
it
counters
the
argument
of
the
respondents
that
all
duties
end
at
that
12-hours
time,
and
it
doesn't.
i--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
and
they
are
not
free
to
go.
they
are
part
of
the
crew,
still,
until
they
finally
mark
off
at
the
away-from-home
terminal.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
deadhead
transportation?
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
not
in
the...
not
as
it
was
finally
passed.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
was...
well,
deadhead
transportation
in
the
originally
drafted
bill
stated
that
all
of
the
deadhead
time
was
time
on
duty,
so
he
was
referring
to
both
provisions,
except
when
i
read
to
you
on
page
135
of
the
house
hearings,
that
only
related
to
the
subsection
(5).
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
and
let
me
address--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
didn't
solve
that
problem.
they
are
still--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--they're
still
on
duty.
now,
i
want
to
point
out,
justice
stevens,
that
another
industry
spokesman,
a
mr.
hilt,
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
national
railway
conference...
this
is
the
negotiating
arm
for
the
railroad
industry.
he
was
asked,
what
does
deadhead
mean?
he
said,
on
page
220
of
the
house
hearing,
deadheading
is
being
transported
from
one
point
to
another
at
carrier's
orders
without
performing
any
service,
and
then,
later
in
his
testimony--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes,
but
later
he
was
asked
by
congressman
tiernan,
in
regards
to
defining
deadhead,
would
you
say
to
the
committee
that
the
definition
covers
the
complete
description
of
deadheading,
and
his
answer
was...
he
didn't
fully
answer.
he
said,
deadheading
is
a
widely
used
term,
except
management
relationships
is
more
or
less
the
complete
definition,
and
then
congressman
tiernan
again
pressed
him.
he
said,
you
don't
want
to
add
anything
to
the
definition
you
gave
with
regards
to
what
deadheading
is,
and
he
said,
i
don't
think
so.
so
he
is
saying
to
congress,
it
is
only
transportation
in,
and
that's
all
it
is,
the
transportation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
that's
what
congress
relied
on.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
really
think--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--who
did?
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
it
was
their
hearings.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
there
were
30-some
on
that
committee.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it's
what
congress--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
do,
because
this
committee
is
the
one
that
drafted
the
provisions,
and
they
relied
on
what
the
witnesses
told
them,
and
it
was
part
of
that
testimony--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they
passed
it
based
on
the
representations
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
unanimously,
i
might
add.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
only--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that's
correct.
congress
didn't
buy
that.
that's
the
whole
point
i'm
making.
the
only
thing
they
bought
from
the
railroad
industry
was,
we're
going
to
give
you
a
break
on
deadheading--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--not
time
on
duty.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
because--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--because
it's
the
abuses,
justice
souter.
they
had
crews
sitting
out
there
hours
on
end,
and
they
still
do,
and
the
problem
is,
maybe
there's
no
immediate
danger
to
safety
because
they're
not...
the
crew's
not
going
to
operate
this
particular
train
any
more,
but
it
gets
cumulative.
day-in,
day-out,
you're
not
knowing
when
you're
going
on
duty,
8
hours
later
today,
6
hours
earlier
tomorrow,
and
it
cumulates,
and
as
i
quoted--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--it
doesn't,
but
you
have...
and
i
submit
that
cumulative
fatigue
is
a
cause
of
serious
safety
problems,
as
stated
by
the
national
transportation
safety
board,
which
i've
quoted,
as
stated
by
the
general
accounting
office
as
well--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--they
do.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it's
a
safety
problem.
we're
not
talking
about
wages.
we're
talking
about
safety.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it's
not
an
economic
problem.
that's
the
whole
point.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
because
day
in
and
day
out,
that
time
is
not
regular,
and
it
cumulates
this
fatigue,
and
i...
when
you
have
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the...
and
even
the
reports
of
the
federal
railroad
administration
point
out
to
the...
this
problem
in
the
railroad
industry,
and
it
is
definitely
a
cause
of
accidents.
employee
error
causes
about
30
percent
of
the
rail
accidents
in
this
country,
and
a
significant
portion
of
those
that
were
addressed
by
the
national
transportation
safety
board
involve
fatigue,
and
both
chairman
of
the
board,
as
well
as
the
vice
chairman,
going
to
congress
several
times
trying
to
get
attention
to
this
problem,
and
this
is
what
congress
was
trying
to
do,
and
that's
why
they
didn't
buy
the
amendment
sought
by
the
railroads.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they
didn't
change
the
bill.
the
bill
is
exactly
the
same
as
what
was
complained
of.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
maybe
not
specific
words,
waiting
time,
but
they
addressed
it
clearly
in
two
ways.
one
is,
which
i've
just
mentioned,
they
did
not
change
the
wording
at
all
from
the
introduced
bill
and
that
which
was
complained
about
by
the
industry.
they
didn't
change
it
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
not
on
waiting
time.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
what--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--but
that's--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--they
solved
it
by
saying
you
can't
get
that
relief
that
you
want.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
thank
you,
your
honor.
