justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
mann,
is
it
your
position
that
if
you
are
deadheaded
back
to
your
final
point
of
release,
while
you're
waiting
to
get
the
first
train,
let's
say
to
omaha,
that
is
on-duty
time?
what
about...
suppose
you
have
to
wait
again
in
omaha
to
get
another
train
to
new
york
city,
where
you're
going
to
be
released?
what
about
that
wait?
is
that
part
of
deadhead--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you're
not
on
duty
while
you
go
from
omaha
to...
where
did...
from
wherever
you're...
wherever
you
end
your
work
to
omaha,
you're
not
on
duty--
justice
antonin
scalia
--while
you're
being
transported?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
deadheaded
transportation
back
is
not
counted.
justice
antonin
scalia
--my
tour
has
ended
in
san
francisco.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i...
they've
arranged
to
get
me
back
by
putting
me
on
a
train
to
omaha,
all
right.
now,
you
say
while
i'm
waiting
in
san
francisco,
i'm
still
on
duty,
all
right.
what
about
while
i'm
waiting
in
omaha?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
the
transportation
while
i'm
on
the
train
between
san
francisco
and
omaha?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
magic?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if...
it
makes
no
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
it's
an
anomaly
that
i'm
on
duty
while
i'm
at
rest
and
back
on
duty
whenever
i
start
moving
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
i
have
eight
stops
along
the
way,
i'm
on-off,
on-off.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
assume
you
don't
take
the
position
that
when
the
van
stops
for
a
red
light
he's
back
on
duty,
do
you?
[laughter]
is
it
a...
it's
not
an
in-motion
theory,
not
completely
that,
huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
factual
question.
we
didn't
take
this
case
to
figure
out
the
fact
of
whether
there
are
duties,
and
i
at
least
am
going
to
decide
it
on
the
assumption
that
there
aren't.
now,
if
you
can
prove
that
there
are
duties
in
a
particular
case,
it's
a
different
case.
but
let's
assume
there
are
no
duties,
that
the
railroad
worker
is
simply
waiting
to
go
back
to
where
his
rest
time
begins.
now,
i
can
see
why
congress
would
want
deadhead
time,
including
the
time
waiting
for
the
deadhead
transportation
to
arrive,
i
can
understand
why
they
would
want
that
to
count
at
the
beginning
of
the
work
period,
because
by
the
end
of
the
work
period,
the
worker's
going
to
be
very
tired.
you
should
count
that
time
against
him,
right?
but
at
the
end
of
the
work
period,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
doing
any
more
work
for
the
railroad,
his
rest
time
for
the
mandatory
period
of
rest
he
has
to
take
doesn't
begin...
this
is
limbo
time,
right,
it's
not
rest
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what...
why
would
congress
want
it
to
count
towards
work
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but--
--when
they
have
more
duties
later.
that
was
addressing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
situation
when
they
have
more
duties
later,
so
that
their
total
on
the
job,
their
total
time
on
the
job
will
be
stretched,
and
by
the
end
of
the
job,
they'll
be
very
tired.
justice
antonin
scalia
here
we're
talking,
by
definition,
about
a
situation
where
their
job
is
done,
and
it's
not
going
to
be
counted
toward
their
rest
time,
and
it's
not
going
to
make
them
more
tired
for
any
duties
that
they
perform.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
he
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
do
you
think
heard
that
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
congress
heard
that
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
people
do
you
think
were
present
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
you
think
because
30
members
of
congress,
if
they
were
all
present
at
the
hearing,
heard
him
say
those
words.
you
want
us
to
assume
that
therefore
the
statute
means
what
he
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
seem
reasonable
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
pass
the
statute.
there
are
how
many,
432
members
of
congress,
530,
532,
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
passed
the
statute,
not
the
30--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
guaranteed
rest
period
whenever
they
get
back,
and
that
is
not
shortened
whether
this
limbo
time...
i
mean,
this
limbo
time
doesn't
go
toward
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
does
the
government
assert
any
entitlement
to
deference
of
its
views
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
that
would
mean,
of
course,
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
deference
point,
is
that
although
we...
if
we
were
to
find
your
interpretation
reasonable,
you
could
change
the
interpretation
later.
even
if
we
thought
yours
was
the
more
reasonable
you
would
still
be
able
to
go
to
the
other
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
the
fra
does
not
have
rule-making
authority
explicitly
conferred,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
is
a
circuit
conflict,
is
there
not,
on
whether
agencies
that
do
not
have
rule-making
authority
are
entitled
to
deference?
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
reserved
the
question,
haven't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
us
to
decide
that
in
this
case,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
understood
me
to
mean
chevron
deference,
didn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could
be
given
those
instructions
for
rest
time,
too,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
call
them?
you
call
them
an
outlawed
crew?
is
that
the
industry
terminology?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
penalties
are
there
for
violating...
i
mean,
i
can
imagine
you
might
have
a
snowstorm
or
something,
and
you
can
just
stop
the
train,
but
if
that
unforeseen
delay
causes
your
crew
to
be
on
duty
longer
than
you
had
expected,
what
would
the
penalties
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
they
might
make
an
exception
for
snowstorms.
you
know,
even
if
we
adopted
the
union's
view
of
the
matter,
there...
couldn't
we
count
on
the
agency's
discretion
not
to
impose
the
penalty
when
indeed
the
reason
the
excessive
time
occurred
was
simply
some
unforeseen
event
such
as
a
snowstorm?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
i
mean,
you
know,
an
argument
can
be
made
for
the
other
side.
the
argument
is...
what
is
the
rest
period
that's...
what's
the
minimum
rest
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
doesn't
this
scheme
of
the
statute
show
that
congress
thought
that
an
8-hour
rest
period
is
needed
for
a...
what,
10-hour
normal
work
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
a
10-hour
rest
period
is
needed
for
a
12-hour
work
period,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
law...
you
can't
say
there's
just
an
absolute
rest
period
which
is
going
to
be
a
balm
for
all
ills,
no
matter
how
long
you've
been
on...
you
know,
working
before
then,
and
what
the
union
is
saying
is
look,
realistically,
traveling,
deadheading
back
is...
it
takes
it
out
of
you,
and
if
i
should
get
10
hours'
rest
for
12
hours'
duty,
i
should
also
get
10
hours'
rest
for
10
hours
of
duty
plus
2
hours
of
deadheading
back,
including
the
waiting
time
for
the
deadheading.
i
don't
know
that
that's
an
unreasonable
argument.
i
mean,
the
minimum
time
is
a
minimum
time
that
has
been
calculated
on
the
basis
of
what
the
maximum
duty
time
was,
and
if
that
duty
time
is
stretched
out,
maybe...
you
know,
maybe
the
minimum
time
should
be
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
safety
issue,
they
say,
and
congress...
you
know,
congress
was
concerned
with
safety.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
it's
purely
fortuitous
whether
it
helps
that
problem
or
hurts
that
problem.
it
could
help
it.
