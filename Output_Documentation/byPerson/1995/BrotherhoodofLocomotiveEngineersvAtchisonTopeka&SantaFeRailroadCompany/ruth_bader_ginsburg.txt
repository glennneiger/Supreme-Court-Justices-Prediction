--if
i
understand
your
argument
correctly,
your
meaning
would
have
been
conveyed
better
if
the
word
interim
were
left
out,
just
a
period
available
for
rest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
interim
add
that
helps
rather
than
hurts
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
be
stronger,
your
argument
would
be
stronger,
would
it
not,
if
the
statute
didn't
say,
interim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mann,
what
happens
if
i'm
being
transported
back
in
a
van
and
there's
a
breakdown,
and
it
takes
3
hours
to
get
that
van
fixed
so
it
can
move
again
to
the
place
where
i'll
be
released?
we
know
that
the
time
that
you're
in
the
van
is
deadhead
time,
and
it's
not
on-duty
time.
what
about
when
the
car
breaks
down
and
i'm
waiting
to
have
it
fixed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
service.
i'm
waiting--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
the
van
to
be
fixed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
can
interpret.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
can
interpret,
and
they
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
said,
we
think
that
two
things
go
together.
when
you're
going
to
the
job,
then
the
waiting
time,
everything,
is
on-duty
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
when
you're
going
from
the
job,
then
everything
is
this
limbo
thing.
why
doesn't
that
just
make
entire
sense
as
an
interpretation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
thing
is
not
the
same.
you
can't
get
very
far
with
your
release
point,
because
the
statute
tells
us
that
the
deadhead
transportation
time
back,
before
the
point
at
which
you're
released,
that
that
time
is
limbo
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
case...
in
answer
to
my
question,
you
were
candid,
and
i
appreciated
it.
you
said
if
the
van
breaks
down
so
that
they're
not
moving,
that's
limbo
time,
and
it's
clear
that
in
that
situation
they
have
no
trains
to
watch--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no
safety
hazards
to
report,
they
have
nothing
to
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--except
wait.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think...
do
i
understand
you
right
to
be
saying
that
you're
not
talking
about
the
chevron
kind
of
deference,
because
there's
no
delegated
rule-making
authority
here,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
talking
about
the
skidmore
kind
of
deference
where
the
agency,
because
it's
been
in
the
business,
where
the
court
would
look
to
the
persuasiveness
of
its
reasons
that's
kind
of
a--
--is
that
what
you
were
talking
about?
i
was
talking
about
chevron
deference.
i
would
have
to
rephrase
my
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do
agree
that,
if
there's
any
duty
assigned,
like
watch
the
train
to
see
that
there's
no
vandalism,
that
that's
full
on-duty
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
to
whom
the
penalties
are
paid
for
violations?
