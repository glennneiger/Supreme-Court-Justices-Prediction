justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
1969
hearings,
and
you
quoted
mr.
manion's
statement,
which
i
guess
is
the
same
one,
at
page
20
of
your
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
his
references
to
1(b)(3)(a)
in
the
bill
that
was
then
pending,
that's
what
finally
was
enacted
as
subsection
(5),
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
at
that
time
the
subsection
(4)
with
the
second
clause
in,
at
least,
was
not
in
the
bill?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
that
was
not
yet
in
the
bill,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
it
is
fair
to
infer
as
part
of
your
argument,
i
gather,
that
in
paragraph
(4)
everything
after
the
word,
but,
was
enacted
in
response
to
the
concern
expressed
by
mr.
manion
on
page
20
of
your
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
was
then
subsection
(3).
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
(4)
was
amended
in
response
to
this
testimony,
is
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my
question
is,
if
you...
and
the
question,
then,
is,
what
does
the
word
deadhead
transportation
mean
in
that
amendment,
under
your
analysis?
the
question,
does
it
include
the
time
waiting
for
the
transportation
to
begin?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
that's
what
we're
trying
to
decide,
as
i
understand
it.
now,
if
your
view
is
correct
that
it
does
not
include
the
period
before
they
get
on
the
bus,
or
whatever
it
is,
how
did
that
solve
the
problem
he
described
on
page
20
of
the
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
you
construe
it
the
way
the
government
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again,
he's
describing
something
before
that's
in
the
bill.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
still
haven't
answered--
--you
think...
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
counsel,
even
if
you
confine
yourself
to
the
committee
members...
i
understand
what
you're
trying
to
say.
you're
not
going
to
convince
justice
scalia
on
this,
but
you
might
convince
me,
so
give
it
a
try.
[laughter]
how
does
the
amendment...
what
i
don't
understand
under
your
view,
assume
that
all
the
committee
members
meant
the
amendment
to
solve
the
problem
described
there,
as
i
read
it,
it
does
not
solve
the
problem--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
the
time
between
they
get
off
the
crew
and
they
wait
for
the
bus
could
run
out
to
several
hours
and
still
cause
the
very
violation
he's
concerned
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
added
that
part
of
subsection
(4).
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
change
in
response
to...
arguably
is
a
change
in
response
to
the
concern
you've
identified.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
think
it
isn't
because
it
doesn't
expressly
say
that.
it's
a
question
of,
what
did
they
mean
by
deadhead
transportation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
intend
to
include
waiting
time,
which
would
have
solved
the
problem--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
get
your
view
on
one,
kind
of
fundamental
thing
for
me?
is
it...
do
you
agree
that
the
second
clause
in
subparagraph
(4)
was
inserted
in
response
to
the
concern
expressed
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
manion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
throw
this
into
the
discussion.
which
opinion,
judge
bauer's
or
judge
easterbrook's,
do
you
think
better
explains
your
position
on
deference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
have
an
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
like
ships
passing
in
the
night,
i
guess.
mr.
stewart
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
why
the
government
didn't
appeal
the
ninth
circuit
and
try
to
reconcile
its
views
of
the
better
interpretation
with
national
uniformity
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
very
important
question?
the
term
dog-catcher
refers
to
the
crew
that
picks
up
the
outlawed
crew,
or
to
the
crew
that
substitutes
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they're
the
substitute
crew.
