--why
would
they
buy
that
little
piece
of
the
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
would
they
say,
we're
going
to
fix
this
part
but
you're
in
trouble
for
the
rest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know
how
many
designated
terminals
an
employee
usually
has?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your
view,
if
the
employee
waits
for
deadhead
transportation
after
his
duty,
when
he's
off
duty,
and
then
goes
to
a
designated
terminal
which
is
available
for
rest
under
(5),
but
then
he's
also
waiting
for
further
transportation,
i
take
it
that
this
is
on
duty,
because
he
has
a
place
to
rest,
even
though
he's
also
waiting
for
further
deadhead
transportation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
it's
on-duty
time
once
he
gets
to
a
place
other
than
a
designated
terminal
and
it's
available
for
rest,
pursuant
to
(5),
or
is
that
not
an
interim
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see.
so
interim
is
followed
and
preceded
by
on
duty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
involves
the
hours
of
service
act
congress
first
passed
in
1907
is
designed
for
railway
safety
by
limiting
the
number
of
hours
a
train
crew
may
remain
on
duty.
it
requires
the
railroads
to
provide
crew
members
with
a
certain
number
of
off
duty
rest
periods
of
adequate
rest
and
before
a
new
shift
can
begin.
as
a
general
rule,
a
train
crew
may
not
work
more
than
12
consecutive
hours
and
when
the
limit
is
reached,
the
crew
must
ceased
at
once
and
a
six
number
of
hours
of
rest
as
i
have
indicated
in
the
designated
rest
term
must
be
afforded
before
the
new
shift
can
begin.
if
a
crew
works
more
than
12
consecutives
hours,
as
specified
in
the
act
the
railroad
places
heavy
fines
for
each
member
of
the
crew
who
works
beyond
the
permitted
period.
this
means
that
railroad
try
to
schedule
their
operations
so
that
a
crew
can
change
at
a
convenient
terminal
point
but
sometimes
this
cannot
occur.
if
the
12-hour
limit
is
about
to
be
reached,
the
railroad
must
stop
the
train
so
that
the
second
crew
can
replace
the
first
crew
then
the
crew
that
is
to
be
relieved
at
the
end
of
the
shift
is
now
called
the
outlawed
crew,
and
transportation
of
the
fresh
crew
to
the
train
and
with
the
outlawed
crew
back
to
the
rest
point
is
called
deadhead
transportation.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
how
to
classify
the
time
of
the
outlawed
crew
spends
waiting
for
the
deadhead
transportation
to
arrive.
the
petitioners
of
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
and
the
united
transportation
union
claim
that
the
waiting,
a
time
is
on-duty
time
that
counts
against
the
12-hour
limit.
the
railroad
and
the
federal
railroad
administration
which
is
the
agency
that
administers
the
act
says
that
the
waiting
time
is
not
on-duty
time.
they
claim
it
so
called
limbo
time.
this
is
a
third
category
of
time
that
the
act
does
recognize
although
it
does
not
call
it
by
this
name.
limbo
time
does
not
count
for
on-duty
time
or
the
crewâ€™s
rest
time
and
limbo
time
is
paid
time.
we
agree
with
the
railroads
and
federal
railroad
administration
at
the
time
spent
waiting
for
the
deadhead
transportation
is
not
on-duty
time,
it
is,
in
our
view,
limbo
time.
the
deadhead
transportation
for
the
outlawed
crew
has
that
character
and
we
conclude
that
the
time
waiting
for
the
deadhead
transportation
should
be
characterized
the
same
way.
the
time
the
employees
spent
in
waiting
for
the
deadhead
transportation
will
not
contribute
to
employee
fatigue
during
the
work
assignment
because
of
the
interval
rest
period
that
will
take
place.
as
our
reading
of
the
act
is
in
full
accord
with
that
given
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
en
banc
decision,
which
we
now
review,
the
judgment
is
affirmed
and
the
opinion
for
the
court
is
unanimous.
