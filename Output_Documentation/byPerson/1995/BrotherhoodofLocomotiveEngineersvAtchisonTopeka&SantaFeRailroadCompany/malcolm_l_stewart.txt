mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
view
of
the
federal
respondents,
time
spent
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
a
deadhead
vehicle
at
the
conclusion
of
an
employee's
duty
assignment
is
neither
on
nor
off-duty
time.
that
construction
is
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
pertinent
statutory
provision,
and
with
the
policies
underlying
the
hours
of
service
act.
as
justice
breyer
was
saying
in
one
of
his
questions,
if
a
person
is
asked,
how
much
time
did
it
take
you
to
travel
from
washington
and
boston,
the
question
is
ambiguous.
if
the
import
of
the
question
is,
how
big
a
chunk
out
of
your
day
did
the
process
of
travel
take,
a
person
would
normally
answer
it
in
a
way
that
included
associated
waiting
time.
if
the
person
were
known
to
find
air
travel
particularly
uncomfortable
or
unpleasant,
the
person
might
naturally
infer
that
the
point
of
the
question
was,
how
much
time
were
you
placed
in
this
uncomfortable
position,
and
might
answer
it
in
a
way
that
included
only
the
time
actually
in
the
air.
so
to
see
whether
waiting
time
should
be
counted
as
part
of
time
spent
in
deadhead
transportation,
i
think
the
inquiry
should
focus
on,
why
did
congress
define
this
as
limbo
time
in
the
first
place,
and
do
the
same
concerns
that
caused
congress
to
define
a
category
of
limbo
time
apply
with
equal
force
to
the
waiting
time
at
issue
here,
and
for
all
purposes
relevant
to
the
hours
of
service
act,
the
time
spent
waiting
for
the
deadhead
vehicle
is
functionally
indistinguishable
from
time
actually
riding
in
that
vehicle.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
a
couple
of
responses.
i
think
first,
as
to
what
complaints
of
abuse
were
brought
before
the
congressional
committee
that
held
the
hearings,
the
union's
complaints
focused
both
on
the
waiting
time
and
on
the
length
of
transportation
itself.
that
is,
there
were
statements
to
the
effect
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
and
the
senate
committee
report
stated
that
part
of
the
problem
was
that
an
employee...
several
hours
of
an
employee's
off-duty
time
might
be
time
deadheading
back
from
his
duty
assignment,
so
clearly...
there's
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
believed
that
the
ride
in
the
deadhead
vehicle
itself
was
typically
short,
but
that
the
waiting
periods
were
typically
lengthy,
so
i
don't
believe
that
the
legislative
history
provides
a
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
two.
the
reason
that
time
spent
in
deadhead
transportation
is
limbo
time
is
that
it
shares
some
of
the
characteristics
of
both
on
and
off-duty
time.
that
is,
the
employee
is
not
free
to
come
and
go
as
he
pleases.
the
employee
is
unlikely
to
have
a
meaningful
opportunity
for
rest,
and
therefore
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
count
this
as
off-duty
time
and
count
it
towards
the
minimum
number
of
consecutive
hours
of
rest
that
he
has
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
know
if
i
would
say
that
mr.
manion
specifically,
but
yes,
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes.
the
original
bill,
the
bill
as
originally
introduced
provided
that
time
deadheading
either
to
or
from
a
duty
assignment
would
be
considered
on-duty
time,
and
this
appears
to
reflect
a...
to
define
the
deadheading
from
a
duty
assignment
as
limbo
time
appears
to
reflect
a
compromise
that
allayed
the
concerns
of
the
railroads
while
ensuring
that
this
would
not
be
treated
as
off-duty
time,
thereby
depriving
the
employee
of
an
adequate
opportunity
for
rest.
so
because
the
employee
is
not
free
to
come
and
go
as
he
pleases,
and
is
unlikely
to
have
a
meaningful
opportunity
for
rest,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
consider
this
off-duty
time.
on
the
other
hand,
so
long
as
the
employee
has
no
duties
to
perform,
his
fatigue
can
pose
no
danger
to
himself
and
others,
or
others,
and
therefore
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
treat
this
as
on-duty
time,
and
i
think
it's
instructive
to
contrast
this
with
the
interim
periods
available
for
rest
that
mr.
mann
referred
to.
that
is,
the
reason
that
the
interim
periods
are
defined
as
on-duty
time
is
not
that
the
employee
poses
a
danger
during
those
periods
himself.
that
clearly
wouldn't
be
the
case
if
the
employee
is
performing
no
services.
rather,
the
reason
is
that
if
these
periods
are
not
provided
at
a
place
where
an
employee
actually
has
an
adequate
opportunity
for
rest,
the
employee
is
likely
to
be
tireder
at
the
end
of
that
period
than
at
the
beginning,
and
therefore
they
need
to
be
counted
as
on-duty
time
in
order
to
ensure
that
he's
not
performing
safety-sensitive
tasks
more
than
12
hours
after
he
initially
reported
for
duty.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
typically,
i
think
my
understanding
is
that
typically
there
would
be
a
home
terminal
and
an
away-from-home
terminal.
this
is
generally
a
subject
of
collective
bargaining,
and
mr.
johnson
may
have
a
more
precise
answer
than
i
do,
so
that
what
is
a
designated
terminal
insofar
as
a
particular
employee
is
concerned
is
defined
not
by
the
act,
but
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
question,
but
our
position
is
that
after
the
employee
has
been
released
of
the
obligation
to
perform
any
duties,
all
of
the
waiting
and
the
actual
riding
would
be
considered
limbo
time,
and
the
statute
speaks
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
not
an
interim
period.
the
interim
periods
would
be
those
that
are
preceded
and
followed
by
periods
of
service,
and
again,
the
reason
for
treating
those
periods
differently
is,
if
you're
going
to
have
to
perform
services
when
the
period
is
over,
we're
concerned
about
whether
you're
going
to
be
tired
and
pose
a
safety
hazard
at
that
time,
but
if
your
tour
of
duty
is
up,
if
you're
simply
in
the
process
of
getting
from
your
duty
assignment
to
the
place
that
you'll
get
your
8
or
10
hours
consecutive
rest,
that
concern
is
not
present.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
we
do.
this
is...
obviously,
this
litigation
has
taken
a
strange
path
in
the
sense
that
the
government
is
asserting
a
different
reading
of
the
statute
than
we
asserted
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
concerns
that
caused
the
fra
to
shift
its
position,
briefly,
essentially
are
inapposite
once
the
case
comes
before
the
court.
that
is,
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
government
was
asserting
that
the
interest
in
nation-wide
uniformity
was
so
great
as
to
outweigh
the
interest
in
choosing
the
better
of
the
two
readings
as
between
two
that
the
fra
considered
within
the
realm
of
reasonableness.
given
that
we're
in
this
court,
and
that
whatever
ruling
this
court
hands
down
obviously
will
have
nation-wide
application,
there's
no
need
to
balance
any
concern
for
uniformity
against
competing
interests.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
correct.
it
would
depend
to
a
certain
degree
on
how
the
court
wrote
the
opinion.
if
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
not
only
is
this
a
reasonable
construction
but
it's
in
our
view
the
only
one
that
could
plausibly
be
asserted--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
that's
correct,
as
to
the
hours
of
service
act.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
there
is...
there
are...
this
court
has
accorded--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
because
our...
clearly,
we
believe
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
the
better
of
the
two,
and
if
the
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
the
fra
is
entrusted
with
the
responsibility
for
assessing
civil
penalties,
but
it
is
not
given
substantive
rule-making
authority.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
under--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
i
did.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
part
of
the
problem
with
that
is
that
in
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
have
an
answer,
because
i
think
neither
really
goes
to
the
question.
that
is,
at
this
point,
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
question
of
deference
arose
in
the
context
of
the
fra's
argument
that
it's
concern
for
nation-wide
uniformity
was
so
great
as
to
trump
its
view
as
to
what
was
the
better
reading
of
the
statute,
and
we...
the
fra
in
the
court
of
appeals
asked
that
court
to
defer
to
the
fra's
view
regarding
the
importance
of
nation-wide
uniformity
as
opposed
to
the
importance
of
getting
the
better
of
the
two
answers,
so
the
two
opinions
were
addressed
to
that
sort
of
deference.
here,
what
we're
talking
about
is
deference
regarding
the
fra's
view
as
to
what
is
the
more
persuasive
meaning
of
the
statutory
language,
so
the
types
of
things
that
judge
bauer
and
judge
easterbrook
were
debating
really
are
not
particularly
germane
to
this
court's
resolution
of
the
question.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
would
only
remark
that
it
was
the
first
court
of
appeals
ruling
that
had
addressed
the
question,
and
it
would
be...
there
would
be
nothing
in
this
court's
rules,
obviously,
that
would
preclude
us
from
filing
a
cert
petition
or
the
court
from
granting
it,
but
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
court's
normal
practice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
these
go
to
questions
of
both
litigation
strategy
and
also
the
fra's
view
as
to
the
importance
of
uniformity
as
of
a
particular
moment.
certainly
a
reasonable
person
could
believe
that
that
would
have
been
the
better
course.
obviously,
the
reasonableness
of
that
decision
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
stage.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
with
respect
to
the
vandalism
point,
i
would
like
to
distinguish
between
two
types
of
instructions
that
an
employee
could
be
given.
if
the
employee
were
told,
watch
for
vandalism,
be
alert,
be
vigilant,
that
is
clearly
on-duty
time.
if
the
employee
were
told,
you
can
do
whatever
you
want,
read,
play
cards,
sleep,
but
if
you
happen
to
see
vandalism
you
have
an
obligation
to
report
it,
we
wouldn't
regard
the
reading,
sleeping,
et
cetera
time
as
on-duty
time,
but
if
vandalism
happened
to
catch
the
employee's
eye,
and
he
reported
it
pursuant
to
instructions,
that
act
would
be
on
duty.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
and
even
if
there
were
no
identified
contingency
that
would
call
the
employee
back
into
duty,
these
people
are
always
in
radio
contact
with
supervisors.
the
possibility
would
always
exist
that
a
supervisor
would
give
an
instruction
to
the
employee
to
do
a
particular
thing,
so
whenever
the
employee
is
in
this
waiting
period,
there
always
exists
the
possibility
of
being
recalled
to
duty
whatever
the
instructions
he
was
given
at
the
outset
of
that
period.
the
only
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
i
think
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
buttressed
by
the
other
point
at
which
time
spent
in
deadhead
transportation
is
used
in
the
same
section
of
the
hours
of
service
act.
that
is,
the
act
provides
that
time
spent
in
deadhead
transportation
to
a
duty
assignment
is
considered
time
on
duty,
and
i
feel
quite
certain
that
the
union
would
state
that
time
spent
in
deadhead
transportation
to
a
duty
assignment
includes
any
waiting
period
between
the
time
that
the
employee
reports
and
the
time
that
the
deadhead
vehicle
is
actually
ready
to
go.
that's
buttressed
by
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
by
the
legislative
history,
which
the
senate
report
states
that
time
spent
in
deadhead
transportation
to
a
duty
assignment
is
to
be
calculated
from
the
time
an
employee
reports
for
duty,
so
this
gives
further
confirmation
of
the
fact
that
the
waiting
period
is
properly
included
within
the
phrase,
time
spent
in
deadhead
transportation.
thank
you.
