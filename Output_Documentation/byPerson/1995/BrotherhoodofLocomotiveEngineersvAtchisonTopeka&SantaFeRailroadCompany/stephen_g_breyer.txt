but
is
there
something
in
there
that
talks
about
the
definition
of
deadhead
transportation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
deadhead
transportation,
i
would
think
sometimes
when
people
are
transported
they
include
the
time
that
they're
sitting
around
in
the
station
waiting
room--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
the
airport--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
sometimes
they
don't,
so
it
all
seems
quite
ambiguous
to
me,
anyway,
and
if
it's
ambiguous,
shouldn't
you
leave
this
kind
of
interpretation
to
the
agency?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
doesn't
do
it,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
say
i'm
traveling
to
boston.
i
might
or
might
not
include
in
my
travel
time
the
time
spent
at
the
airport.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
is
there
something
there
that
says,
by
the
way,
we
don't
mean
time
spent
at
the
station,
or
spent
at
the
airport,
or
sitting
around
waiting
for
the
train
to
show
up?
is
there
anything
like
that?
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back...
i'm...
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my
question...
and
you
just
didn't
have
a
chance
to
get
out
the
other
two
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what
i
was
curious,
remember,
that
this
word
deadhead
transportation
struck
me,
at
least
in
the
statute,
as
ambiguous,
that
of
course
deadhead
transportation
is
limbo
time,
yes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what
is
deadhead
transportation,
and
my
question
was,
what
evidence
is
there
that
you
could
not...
not
that
you...
but
you
could
not
read
those
words,
deadhead
transportation,
to
include
time
in
the
station,
time
waiting
to
go
on
the
train
itself,
as
we
do
with
airplanes
and
trains
normally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
it
in...
and
you
listed
three
things.
the
first
thing
was,
you
said
i
should
look
at
the
commingled,
the
definition
of
commingled--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
were
going
to
mention
two
others.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
would
i...
where
do
i
find--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
mean
just
in
the
statute
here,
or
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
i've
looked
at
that.
it
didn't
seem--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
is
the
definition
of
commingled
in
the
statute,
the
other
is
the
definition
of
rest
period,
and
what
was
the
third?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if,
in
fact,
it
is
an
abuse,
and
if,
in
fact,
the
agency
has
significant
delegated
power
to
define
deadhead
transportation
either
way
or
partial
ways,
then
couldn't
you
deal
with
that
problem
through
the
agency
dealing
with
it?
