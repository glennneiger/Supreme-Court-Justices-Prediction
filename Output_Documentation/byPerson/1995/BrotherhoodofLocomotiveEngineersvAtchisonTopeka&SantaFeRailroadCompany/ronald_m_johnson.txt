mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
before
the
ninth
circuit
ruling,
there
was...
the
statutory
scheme
was
administered
in
a
very
straightforward,
simple
manner,
predictable
and
certainty
for
the
railroad
in
how
to
schedule
crews
and
operate
their
trains.
the
very
simple
rule
that
the
hours
of
service
act
provided
was
that
you
could
operate
the
crew
up
to
12
hours,
but
if
you
realized,
if
you
saw
that
the
train
was
not
going
to
make
its
intended
terminal,
all
you
had
to
do
to
avoid
a
violation
of
the
act
was
notify
the
crew
to
identify
a
place
where
they
could
pull
over,
park
the
train,
and
then
they
were
relieved
from
all
other
duty.
at
that
point,
all
they
had
to
do
was
wait
for
transportation
to
arrive,
which
typically
also
brought
the
relief
crew
as
well.
the
relief
crew
got
on
the
train,
took
the
train
on
to
its
terminal,
then
the
expired
or
outlawed
crew
would
be
transported
to
its
place
of
final
release.
now,
one
thing
i'd
like
to
make
clear
right
here
is--
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
--there's
a
lot
of
industry
jargon,
your
honor,
and
the
crew
is
outlawed
at
that
point
in
time.
the
crew
sometimes
sent
out
to
pick
it
up
was
called
the
dog-catcher,
to
pick
up
the
outlawed
train.
[laughter]
now,
one
thing
i'd
like
to
point
out
here
is
a
difference
between
us
and
the
unions,
one
among
many
differences,
is
that
they
try
and
argue
that
under
the
statute
the
crew
is
on
duty
until
it
reaches
its
place
of
final
release,
which
is
the
terminal
that
it
didn't
make,
but
that's
not
the
way
the
statute
works.
the
language
is
quite
clear
that
on
duty
runs
from
the
time
you
report
for
duty
until
you're
finally
released
from
duty,
and
you're
finally
released
from
duty
under
the
statute
when
the
railroad
dispatcher
advises
the
crew
you're
relieved
from
duty,
don't
do
anything
else.
now,
i
believe
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
breyer
was
asked,
are
these
crews
paid
while
they're
in
limbo
time,
and
the
answer
is
yes,
they
are
paid
all
throughout
this
time.
they're
paid
while
they're
waiting
for
deadhead
transportation.
they're
paid
while
they're
in
the
deadhead
transportation
vehicle.
they're
paid
until
they
get
to
their
final
terminal.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
well,
they're
paid
at
that
point
in
time,
too,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
yes,
and
actually
they're
paid
a
little
extra
amount,
because--
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
--yes,
your
honor.
from
the
time
they
report
to
duty...
i
mean,
typically
there's
a
train...
they
try
and
schedule
it
so
the
train
is
there
ready
for
them
to
get
on
board
and
go
on,
but
if
the
train
hasn't
come
in
yet,
that
time
period
they're
waiting
to
assume
duty
and
that's
counted
as
on-duty
time.
but
to
come
back
to
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
about
the
pay,
all
that
happens
at
the
place
of
final
release,
they
don't
have
any
more
duties
because
they've
been
relieved
from
duty
on
the
train,
they
have
no
duties
while
they're
waiting
for
deadhead
transportation,
they
have
no
duties
while
they're
in
the
taxicab
or
the
van,
or
another
train,
perhaps,
but
they're
being
paid,
and
when
they
get
to
the
place
of
final
release,
all
that
is,
is
they
clock
out.
that's
all
final
release
means.
when
they
get
to
their
terminal,
they
clock
out.
that
stops
the
pay,
and
it
starts
their
rest
period,
because
the
railroad
has
to
know
when
the
rest
period
begins
so
they
can
be
called
again.
now,
there
aren't
any
abuses
here.
i
know
the
union
attorney
talks
about
abuses
in
the
record,
but
there
really
is
no
record
here
other
than
what
was
put
before
the
agency
by
the
railroads,
because
the
union
did
not
put
anything
in
the
record
other
than
the
stuff
they've
attached
to
their
briefs.
but
even
if
there
were
abuses
here,
the
abuses
were
whatever
they
were
related
to
deadhead
transportation,
and
they've
all
been
addressed
by
the
fact
that
waiting
for
deadhead
transportation
and
the
deadhead
transportation
itself
is
not
counted
towards
the
rest
period,
and
therefore,
when
they
get
to
the
end,
when
they
get
to
the
place
of
final
release,
they
get
their
full
rest
period.
now,
it's
been
very
hard
for
the
railroads
to
try
and
comply
with
this
new
interpretation,
and
that
is
why
the
railroads
went
to
court.
it
is
impossible
to
always
predict,
now...
before,
you
could
simply
predict
that
when
the
train
would
be
outlawed,
you
could
just
tell
the
crew
to
stop.
you
wouldn't
violate
the
law.
the
only
variable
you
had
to
have
was
to
pick
a
place
where
they
could
pull
the
train
aside
off
the
main
line
onto
a
siding.
now,
you
have
to
try
and
predict
not
only
where
they're
going
to
reach
the
12-hour
maximum,
you
have
to
also
work
in
other
variables.
you
have
to
call
transportation,
try
to
get
transportation
to
meet
a
place
before
the
12
hours...
it
just
can't
be
done.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
well,
the
penalties,
the
minimum
penalty
to
be
imposed
is
$500
per
violation.
the
maximum
penalty
is
$20,000
per
violation.
the
violation,
each
crew
member
is
a
violation,
so
if
you
have
three
members
on
the
crew,
that's
three
violations.
that
would
be
three
times
whatever
the
amount
is.
now,
the
agency
has
discretion
above
$500
how
much
to
impose.
currently,
what
they've
been
imposing
is
$1,000
per
violation,
so
each
of
these
crews
typically
has
a
crew
of
two
or
three
people,
it's
$2,000
or
$3,000
per
violation.
now,
the
problem
here
is,
it's
impossible--
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
--yes,
your
honor.
they
have
that...
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
prosecutorial
discretion,
and
also
there's
a
specific
exception
in
the
statute
for
emergency
situation
acts
of
god.
but
what's
happening
right
now
in
the
ninth
circuit,
because
they
still
feel
compelled
to
apply
this
interpretation
of
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
states
within
the
ninth
circuit,
the
railroads
are
continuing
to
be
assessed
violations
for
this
waiting
time.
even
though
the
waiting
time
periods
are
as
little
as
5
minutes,
we're
still
being
faced
with
penalties
right
now.
now,
i'd
like
to
talk
briefly
about
interim
rest
periods.
it's
clear
that
interim
means
you're
between
points
of
duty,
and
all
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
when
they
put
interim...
when
they
defined
what
interim
periods
of
rest
were
in
the
statute
is,
the
case
law
before
1969
was
all
over
the
place.
you
know,
some
courts
would
say
2
hours
works,
some
courts
would
say
3
hours
works.
all
congress
did
was
codified
that
it
has
to
be
at
least
4
hours,
and
it
has
to
be
at
a
certain
place
where
accomodations
are
available
for
rest.
now--
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
--the
penalties
are
paid
to
the
united
states
government.
i
assume
they
go
into
the
treasury,
your
honor.
now,
the
current
interpretation
that
the
union
wants
just
makes
no
sense,
because
the
crew
has
been
relieve
from
all
duties,
has
no
duties,
but
yet
they
would
have
that
crew
continue
to
be
counted
as
on
duty
even
though
they're
not
physically
on
the
train,
even
though
they
have
no
further
duties.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
there's
no
safety
problem
here
because
the
crew
is
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
operate
a
train
again
until
after
they've
received
their
full
rest
period,
and--
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
--the
minimum
rest
period
is
8
hours.
if
they
work
right
up
to
the
maximum
of
12
hours,
it
is
10
hours
under
the
statute.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
now,
that
rest
period
doesn't
begin...
what
happens
when
they
reach...
you
know,
there's
all
this
railroad
industry
jargon
in
the
statute,
but
again,
the
place
of
final
release
simply
means
the
building
that
they
walk
into
when
they
clock
out.
that
means
they're
going
to
begin
their
rest
period,
and
what
they
do
then
is,
if
they're...
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
asked
how
many
terminals
they
have.
they
have
the
home
terminal...
the
home
terminal,
of
course,
they
live
at
their
home,
but
when
they
get
to
their
away-from-home
terminal,
the
railroad
has
made
arrangements...
it's
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
is
all
treated
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreements...
has
made
arrangements
for
a
hotel
to
go
to
and
stuff,
and
that's
where
they
get
their
rest.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
your
honor,
they
have
a
way
to
get
that,
and
the
way
they
get
that
is
expressly
addressed
in
the
statute,
and
that
is
through
collective
bargaining.
congress
specifically
says
in
section
2107
of
the
hours
of
service
act
that
these
are
minimums,
and
nothing
is
to
stop
the
parties
from
sitting
down
and
collectively
bargaining
longer
rest
periods,
and--
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
--that's
true,
your
honor,
and
congress,
though,
has
made
the
judgment
that
safety
is
satisfied
here.
if
we
limit
the
crews
to
12
hours
on
duty,
if
we
make
transportation
time
limbo
time,
and
if
we
mandate
a
minimum
rest
period
of
8
hours,
congress
has
made
a
judgment
that
that
satisfies
the
safety
concern,
and
if
the
parties
want
to
go
beyond
that
minimum
they
can
and,
in
fact,
they
have,
and
some
collective
bargaining
agreements
provide
that
the
minimum
rest
period
is,
in
all
instances
is
10
hours
rather
than
8
hours.
and
the
safety
issue,
though,
here
that
the
unions
are
complaining
about
is
not
the
safety
issue
of
waiting
time,
it's
not
the
safety
issue
of
how
long
the
day
is.
you
read
their
brief,
and
over
and
over
and
over
again,
the
safety
problem
they're
worried
about
is
fatigue
from
irregular
work
hours,
upsetting
circadian
rhythms
because
crews
are
being
called
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
to
man
trains,
and
that's
true.
that's
the
way
the
railroad
business
works.
but
that
is
not
a
safety
issue
that's
addressed
by
this
statute,
because
even
if
you
counted
waiting
time
as
limbo
time,
that
doesn't
affect
the
fact
that
the
crew,
when
it
gets
back
and
after
it's
had
its
rest,
could
be
called
again
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
to
man
that
train.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
again,
the
parties
are
meeting
together
in
task
force
to
address
the
safety
issues
that
may
result
from
these
irregular
work
schedules,
and
congress
last
year
did
add
an
amendment
to
the
hours
of
service
act
that
encouraged
the
parties
to
work
together
to
develop
a
solution,
if
there
is
a
problem
here,
on
irregular
work
hours.
but
there's
not
a
safety
problem
here
with
treating
waiting
time
as
limbo
time,
and
the
government
made
a
reasonable
choice
in
a
somewhat
ambiguous
term
whether
to
treat
it...
that's
one
difference
we
have
with
the
government.
we
believe
there
are
only
two
options
on
how
to
treat
this
waiting
time.
it
can
either
be
treated
as
off-duty
time
or
limbo
time,
and
the
government
made
a
reasonable
choice
to
treat
it
as
limbo
time.
that's
the
way
this
statute
has
operated
for
more
than
20
years,
and
we
believe
that's
the
correct
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
that
picks...
that
refers
to
the
crew
that
comes
out
from
the
terminal
to
pick
up
the
train
that
got
outlawed
because
it
fell
short
of
its
final
destination
because
the
first
crew
outlawed--
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
--they're
the
substitute
crew,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
m.
johnson
i
thank
the
court.
