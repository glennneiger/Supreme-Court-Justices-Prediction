chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-325,
united
states
v.
reorganized
cf&i
fabricators
of
utah.
mr.
jones,
you're
a
bear
for
punishment.
you're
up
again.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
saying,
in
effect,
even
if
you
lose
on
the
first
question,
you're
entitled
to
some
sort
of
relief
on
the
second
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
section
deals
not
just
with
the
federal
government,
but
with
all
governmental
entities.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
is
that
established?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
all
taxes
appropriate
to
sovereignty
are
excise
taxes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
theory
is
that
the
court
said
customs,
income,
and
excise
taxes,
and
they
were
covering
the
waterfront
there,
and
therefore
if
something
isn't
a
customs
duty
and
isn't
an
income
tax,
it
is
by
definition
an
excise
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
state
had
structured
its
tax
scheme
differently
than
the
federal
government?
i
mean,
i
take
it
we
have
to
deal
with
state
tax
schemes
here,
too--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
the
federal
government
doesn't
get
any
bigger
a
break
than
the
state
does
in
trying
to
figure
out
whether
it's
an
excise
tax
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
really
make
much
sense?
i
mean,
the
same
committees
of
congress
don't
draft
bankruptcy
bills
as
draft
tax
bills.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
an
estate
tax
is
an
excise
tax,
certainly
estate
taxes
are
whopping
big,
65
percent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
caption
of
subsection
c,
if
subsection
d
is
miscellaneous
excise--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--not
excise
taxes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
mr.
jones.
mr.
mccardell.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mccardell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
what
extent
are
we
bound
by
a
concession
like
that?
we
do
not
accept,
for
example,
concessions
on
points
of
law
as
being
conclusive,
ordinarily.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
one
thing
to
be
bound
by
a
failure
to
offer
proof,
another
thing
to
be
bound
by
a
concession.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
property
tax.
how
about
a
stamp
tax
on
documents?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccardell.
mr.
jones,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
