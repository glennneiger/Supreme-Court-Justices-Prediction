mr.
jones,
the
section
doesn't
purport
to
include
all
excise
taxes.
it
includes
an
excise
tax
on
a
specific
kind
of
transaction--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
what
is
the
transaction
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
act
of
maintaining
over
a
period
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
a...
it
talks
about
a
transaction
occurring
on
a
specific
date.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
a
more
natural
term
would
be
to
describe
that
as
an
omission
rather
than
a
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
a
failure
rather
than
a
trans...
normally,
a
transaction
is
the
event
of
death,
or
you
sell
something.
i
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
an
unusual
use
of
the
word
transaction.
let
me
put
it
that
way--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
jones,
could
you
help
me,
because
i
frankly...
i
had
thought
it
was...
this
was
expressly
described
as
an
excise
tax,
but
it
really
is
not,
is
it?
what
is
the
closest
thing
to
express
language
in
the
internal
revenue
code...
forget
about
legislative
history
for
a
moment...
that
would
say
the
label
for
this
thing
is
an
excise
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
located
in
the
particular
section--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
your
textual
argument
is
that
it's
in
a
section
of
the
code
that's
entitled
miscellaneous
excise
taxes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
one
doesn't
have
the
word
excise
in
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
most
of
them
are
on
a...
you
know,
you
can
say
you're
being
taxed
on
a
specific
event,
like
a
death
or
a
transaction
or
something,
but
this
is
a
nonevent.
i
mean,
if
you're
right
on
whether
a
nonevent
is
the
same
as
event--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
course,
you
don't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
again...
again,
i
don't
want
to
just
lose
this
one
thought.
the
only
language
in
the
code,
other
than
looking
at
the
tax
and
trying
to
decide
whether
it
fits
the
category,
is
the
title
of
this
section
says
miscellaneous
excise
taxes,
and
it's
in
that
section,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
correct,
in
your
view--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
apply
a
test
to
decide
whether
we
think
it's
an
excise
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mccardell,
i
don't
know
why
the
issue
isn't...
forgetting
these
general
tests
about
taxes
and
penalties,
why
isn't
the
issue
simply
whether
it's
a...
whether
you
call
it
a
tax
or
a
penalty,
it
is
imposed
on
a
transaction
occurring
on
a
certain
date.
if
that
is
the
test,
do
you
win
or
lose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
would
say...
i
think
mr.
jones
would
say,
well,
the
statute
imposed
an
obligation
to
file...
make
a
determination
as
of
the
end
of
the
plan
year
and
know
exactly
what
the
underfunding
was,
and
i
suppose
the
transaction
might
be
described
as
making
a
determination
with
red
figures
in
it...
bing...
and
then
you
pay
10
percent
of
the
red
figure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
that's
the
end
of
the
plan
year,
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--was
that
the
end
of
the
plan
year?
i
want
to
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
they
use
the
term
plan
year,
i
think,
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
treated
the
transaction
date
as
the
date
the
payment
was
due,
rather
than
the
date
the
determination
was
made.
