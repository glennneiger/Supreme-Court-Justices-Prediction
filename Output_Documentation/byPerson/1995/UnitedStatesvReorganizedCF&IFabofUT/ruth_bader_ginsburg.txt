mr.
jones,
one
characteristic
of
many
excise
taxes
is
that
they
are
deductible
from
income,
and
then
that
might
be
one
way
you
could
distinguish
an
excise
tax
from
a
penalty.
this
is
not
deductible,
this...
whatever
you
want
to
call
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--by
the
company,
because
it
didn't
make
the
contribution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how...
is
that
something
that
can
help
us
distinguish
an
excise
tax
from
a
penalty,
excise
taxes
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mccardell,
do
you
know
the
answer
to
my
question
about
the
deductibility
of
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
whole
slew
under
these
miscellaneous
excise
taxes,
and
i
know
one
has
to
do
with
charitable
foundations.
it
seems
to
operate
the
same
way
this
one
does.
you're
supposed
to
do
something
that
doesn't
relate
to
tax.
you
do
it,
and
there's
what's
called
an
excise
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
else,
since
this
is...
there
are
many,
many
things
that
come
under
this
huge
title,
would
be
affected
by
our
answer
to
the
question
in
the
context
of
4971,
what
other
animals
there
are
like
it
in
this
collection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mccardell,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you
are
not
making
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
prior
case?
that
is,
if
you
lose
on
the
first
question,
if
this
is
characterized
in
the
bankruptcy
context
as
an
excise
tax
and
therefore
would
have
priority,
you're
not
saying
that
even
though
it
has
priority
status
it
can
be
subordinated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mccardell,
i
understand
the
big
difference
it
makes
in
the
bankruptcy
context
whether
it's
classified
as
one
or
the
other.
in
terms
of
the
irc,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
it's
labeled
excise
or
penalty,
since,
as
you
have
said,
there's
a
specific
provision
that
makes
this
particular
excise
tax
nondeductible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
do
you
know
whether
it
makes
any
difference
for
the
irc
purposes
alone,
forgetting
bankruptcy,
whether
something
is
labeled
excise
or
penalty,
assuming...
forgetting
about
the
deductibility,
because
this
one
is
not
deductible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
no.
no,
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--forget
bankruptcy.
just
for
the
purposes
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
something
is
labeled
an
excise
tax
or
a
penalty?
