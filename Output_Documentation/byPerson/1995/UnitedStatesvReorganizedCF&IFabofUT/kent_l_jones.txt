mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
i'm
getting
it,
too,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
take
comfort
in
the
thought
that
we're
all
suffering
together
here.
this
case
presents
two
questions.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
tax
imposed
by
section
4971
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
within
the
priority
that
congress
has
established
for
excise
taxes
in
section
507(a)(7)(e)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
second
question
is
whether,
if
this
tax
is
not
entitled
to
that
statutory
priority,
it
may
then
be
subordinated
to
the
claims
of
general
unsecured
creditors
under
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
that
we've
been
discussing.
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
the
second
question
first.
the
case
that
was
just
argued
could
be
said
to
stand,
or
present
the
question
of
whether
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
on
grounds
of
fairness
alone,
would
permit
a
court
to
deviate
from
what
is
known
as
the
absolute
priority
rule.
that
rule,
as
discussed
by
this
court
in
the
norwest
bank
case,
is
that
all
claims
of
a
higher
priority
have
to
be
paid
before
any
claim
of
a
lower
priority
is
paid.
in
the
case
that
was
just
argued,
the
higher
priority
was
the
first
priority
for
postpetition
tax
penalty
claims.
this
case,
the
second
question
in
this
case,
if
it
is
reached,
could
be
said
to
present
the
question
of
whether
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
permit
a
court,
again
on
grounds
of
fairness
alone,
to
deviate
from
what
is
called
the
equality
of
distribution
rule.
that
rule,
as
discussed
by
this
court
in
the
begier
case,
is
that
all
claims
of
the
same
rank
must
be
paid
pro
rata,
without
discrimination
among
them.
now,
because,
in
our
view,
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
are
the
same
in
both
contexts,
and
in
the
absence
of
creditor
misconduct
don't
permit
subordination
either
of
claims
of
the
same
or
of
a
different
rank,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
this
case
in
subordinating
the
innocent
claim
of
the
united
states.
thus,
if
the
court
was
right
that
the
claim
of
the
united
states
didn't
have
a
statutory
priority,
it
was
wrong
in
then
saying
that
the
innocent
claim
of
the
united
states
could
be
subordinated
to
other
general,
unsecured
claims.
that
violates
the
principle
of
equality
of
distribution
and
it
also--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
the
relief
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
would
be
to
be
treated
pro
rata
with
other
general
unsecured
claims,
if
we're
not
a
priority
claim.
now,
the
first
question
in
this
case
is
whether
we
are
a
priority
claim.
section
4971
of
the
internal
revenue
code
was
enacted
in
1974
as
part
of
erisa.
it
imposes
a
tax
of
10
percent
on
underfunded
pension
plans.
congress
expressly
designated
and
described
this
tax
as
an
excise
tax,
and
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
agree
that
something
can
be
called
a
tax
that
isn't,
but
there
are
two
reasons
why
we
think
the
designation
of
this
tax
as
an
excise
tax
is
important,
which
i'll
soon
address,
but
i
did
want
to
make
the
point
here
that
this
tax
does
have
the
two
features
which
are
common
to
excise
taxes,
and
by
the
way,
excise
taxes
are
probably
the
most
common
kind
of
tax
there
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right,
any
state,
federal,
or
local
excise
tax.
subtitles
b
through
e
of
the
internal
revenue
code
are
all
excise
taxes.
there's
the
estate
taxes,
employment
taxes,
miscellaneous
excise
taxes,
alcohol
and
tobacco
taxes...
congress
has
a
lot
of
excise
taxes,
but
the
common
feature,
what
you
can
see
if
you
go
through
them,
is
there
are
two
common
features.
they're
not
universally
present,
but
they're
the
common
characteristics
of
excises,
and
those
are
that
it
is
imposed
upon
a
specific
act
or
event,
in
this
case
the
act
of
maintaining
an
underfunded
pension
plan,
and
second
is
that
it's
imposed
of
a
portion
of
the
value
of
that
act
or
event,
in
this
case
a
portion
of
the
value
of
the
underfunding.
now,
4
years
after
this
tax
was
enacted,
congress,
in
restructuring
the
bankruptcy
code,
enacted
507(a)(7)(e),
which
provides
a
specific,
unqualified
priority
for
any
state,
federal,
or
local
excise
tax.
the
court
of
appeals
reasoned
in
this
case
that
that
priority
could
not
reach
this
tax,
because
this
tax
was
designed
to
enforce
another
law.
it
was
designed
to
deter
the
violation
of
another
law,
and
the
court
regarded
it
as
a
penalty,
and
as
a
penalty
the
court
concluded
it
wouldn't
come
within
the
priority
for
an
excise
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
a
nonpecuniary
loss
penalty,
which
simply
means
that
it's
a
penalty
that
doesn't
recover
money
that
would
otherwise
be
owed,
i
guess.
now,
whether
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
or
its
structure,
or
its
history,
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
be
sustained.
the
text,
of
course,
which
under
ron
pair
is
what
we're
supposed
to
look
at,
says
unqualifiedly
that
any
excise
tax,
state,
federal,
or
local,
is
entitled
to
this
priority.
it
doesn't
contain
any
suggestion
that
an
excise--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
has
a
regulatory
purpose
is
not.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
transaction
language
in
that
code
is
designed
to
key
off
the,
if
you
will,
statute
of
limitations
that
applies
to
excise
tax
claims.
respondents
agree--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--does
which?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
didn't...
i
was
not
being
precise.
i
don't
mean
to
say
a
statute
of
limitations,
but
if
you
look
at
507(a)(7)(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
(e),
all
of
which
address
various
kinds
of
tax
claims,
each
of
them
has
a
limitation
as
to
the
scope
of
a
claim
to
fall
within
the
priority.
for
example,
the
language
in
(a)(7)(e),
if
i'm
paraphrasing
it
properly,
is
that
the
tax
has
to
be
with
respect
to
a
transaction
for
which
a
report
is
due
within
3
years
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
the
word
transaction
has
a
broad
meaning,
and
couldn't
be
reasonably
understood
to
be
a
narrow
meaning.
for
example,
estate
taxes
are
excise
taxes.
what's
the
bargained
for
exchange
if
you
think
of
transaction
that
way?
there's
no
bargained
for
exchange
there.
the
transaction
language
is
the
act--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
estate
gift
taxes
are
excises.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it's
not
addressed
in
the
briefs,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's...
it's
established
in
the
case
law
and
treatises.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
prepared...
i
don't
have
an
answer
to
that
question
now.
i'm
just
speaking
from,
if
you
will,
my
general
knowledge.
excises
are
taxes
that
would
include
estate
taxes,
just
as
they
include
sales
taxes.
they
are
at...
this
court
talked
about
the
fact
that
excises,
customs
duties,
and
income
taxes
are
really
sort
of
the
whole
gamut,
or
as
the
court
said
in
the
steadman
machine
case,
the...
all
of
the
taxes
appropriate
to
sovereignty,
and
you
can
track
that
through
the
way
congress--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
sir.
i
said
that
income,
customs
duties,
and
excises...
the
court
used
the
phrase,
appropriate
to
sovereignty
in
the
steadman
machine
case.
if
you
think
about
it,
customs
duties
are
in
title
19,
income
taxes
are
in
subtitle
a
of
title
26,
and
as
i
said,
subtitles
b
through
e
of
title
26
are
excises.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
the
point
the
court
was
making
was
that
these
are
broad
and
flexible
terms.
i
don't
think
the
court
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to
was
trying
to
be
specific
in
the
way
that
you're
suggesting.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
wouldn't
say
any
bigger
a
break,
but
i
do
think
that
the
mansfield
tire
court
was
probably
right
in
saying
that
when
congress
expressly
designates
something
as
an
excise
tax
there's
no
reason
to
think
it
didn't
intend
to
have
its
excises
included
within
the
priority
that
it
adopted
for
excise
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
makes
sense
if
you
think
about
it
from
two
perspectives.
it
makes
sense
if
you
think
about
the
fact
that
congress
is
the
one...
i
mean,
if
you're
trying
to
decide
what
is
the
excise
tax,
the
best
evidence
of
that
is...
would
be
to
go
through
the
internal
revenue
code
and
to
see
what
congress
has
done.
i
mean,
when
i
suggested
that
there
are
two
common
characteristics
for
excises,
i
think
that
was
correct,
and
that's
based
on
observation
of
what
congress
has
done.
congress
has
probably
enacted
as
many,
if
not
more
taxes
than
anybody.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
on--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
transaction
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
act
of
maintaining
an
underfunded
pension
plan.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
report
on
that
is
due
on
a
specific
date.
it's
an
end
of
year
event.
there
are
other
excise--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
the
maintaining
on
the
reporting
date--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
it's
the
act
of,
on
that
date,
of
maintaining
that
tax.
it
is
a
specific
event.
there
are
other
excise--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
a
broad
use
of
the
word
transaction,
and
you
can
only
understand
it
in
a
broad
context
when
you
understand
the
broad
concept
of
excises.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
think
congress
thought
it
was
drawing
such
a
line.
it
spoke
quite
broadly
that
it's
priority
would
extend
to
any
state,
federal,
or
local
tax
expressly
treated
or
generally
considered
to
be
an
excise.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the...
there's
a
lot
of
issues
that
i
want
to
talk
about
in
answering
that
question.
the
first,
of
course,
is
that
this
court
isn't
going
to
be
asked
to
decide
that
question,
but
i
will--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
understand
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
united
states
has
never
pursued
in
an
appellate
court
the
question
of
the
priority
of
the
subsection
(b)
tax,
and
there
are
reasons
to
think
that
the
treatment
to
be
accorded
to
those
taxes
is
different
than
the
treatment
to
be
accorded
to
the
10-percent
priority.
there
are
two
differences
that
i
think
can
be
addressed
at
this
point.
there
are
others
that
may
also
exist.
there
is,
of
course,
the
facial
difference
between
a
10-percent
tax
that
conforms
to
the,
if
you
will,
ordinary
concept
of
an
excise
as
a
tax
on
the
portion
of
the
value,
and
a
100-percent
tax,
which
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--which
would
be,
i
suppose,
a
whopping
big
excise
tax.
whether
congress
can
enact
a
whopping
big
excise
tax
is
something
that
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
reason
to
think
it
can't,
but
i
think
it's
something
we'd
have
to
address
if
we
ever
argued
that
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right,
estate
taxes
can
get
very
high.
now,
the
other
point
that
i
think
is
a
more
problematic
distinction
between
those
two
taxes--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
[laughter]
more
problematic
even
than
whopping
big
is
the
fact
that
the
(b)
tax,
unlike
the
(a)
tax,
and
unlike,
if
you
will,
many
other
excise
taxes
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
is
expressly
subject
to
waiver
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
on
any
grounds
that
he
thinks
is
appropriate.
that's
a...
that
kind
of
discretionary
enforcement
would
raise
a
question
about
whether
congress
has
treated
this
as
a
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
it's
labeled...
expressly
labeled
in
the
statute
a
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
it's...
nor
is
it...
nor
is
it
within
the
(a)--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--nor
is
it
within
the
section
that
imposes
most
congressional
excise
taxes.
congress
designates
this
as
an
excise
tax
both
by
its
location
within
the
code,
of
course,
which
congress
is
cognizant
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--which
also
applies
to
(b).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i'm...
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is,
i
think
there
are
reasons
why
you
would
certainly
want
to
reserve
the
question,
but
even
if
you
were
later
to
address
it,
there
are
reasons
why
you
might
draw
a
distinction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
very
important,
and
it's
the...
in
the
words
of
the
legislative
history,
which
i
think
are
useful
guides,
it
says,
if
congress
has
expressly
treated
it
as
an
excise,
or
has...
or
if
it's
commonly
understood
to
be
one,
and
so
the
question
that
i'm
noting
about
the
(b)
tax
is
that,
well,
it
hasn't
been
expressly
treated
as
an
excise
when
it's
subject
to
waiver
on
any
grounds
the
secretary
considers
proper.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
could,
if
you
wished,
use
the
language
which
the
legislative
history
contains,
which
is
what
has
been
expressly
treated
as
an
excise
by
congress.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
really
don't
mean
to
try
to
use
the
word
designation
as,
as
the
one
court
said,
a
label.
i
think
the
labeling
is
important,
but
it's
the
treatment
of
this
as
an
excise
tax,
and
the
fact
that
it
shares
common--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
in
terms
of
labeling,
congress
located
this
within--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
subtitle
d,
which
is
called
miscellaneous
excise
taxes.
the
legislative
history
describes
it
as
an
excise
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
sure.
relatively
few
federal
excise
taxes
have
the
word
excise
in
them.
i
mean,
it's
just
not
a
legislative
draftsmanship
thing.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
it
doesn't,
and
very
few
do.
most
excise
taxes
are
like
this.
they're
taxes,
like
the
estate
and
gift
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
are--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
are...
there's
an
excise
tax
on
maintaining
a
trust
with
excessive
amounts
of
undistributed
income.
there
are
other
kinds
of
excise
that
follow
this
pattern.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
would
be
the
only
language,
if
you
will,
in
the
code.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
now,
in
answering
that
question,
let
me
point
out
something
that
we
haven't
addressed.
we
don't
think
it's
relevant,
but
i
do
want
to
point
it
out.
in
7806
of
the
code,
it
says
that
in
interpreting
statutes
you're
not
to
look
at
captions,
basically.
i'm
summarizing.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we're
not
suggesting
that
this
is
a
question
of
interpreting
the
statute.
it's
a
question
of
understanding
how
congress
has
treated
this
statute
to
determine
whether
it's
an
excise.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
everything--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
scalia,
what
i've
said
is
that
to
the
extent
that
possible
distinctions
exist
elsewhere,
we're
not
trying
to
answer
those
questions,--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
i've
answered--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
have
to
look
for
some
evidence
to
answer
the
question
of
what
is
an
excise
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
congress
has
expressly
treated
it
as
an
excise,
then
it
is,
and
all
i'm--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--congress
has
done
more
than
just
locating
it
in
this
section.
it's
made
it
a
fixed
and
determinate
excise
tax,
and
to
understand
why
i'm
emphasizing
that,
i
want
to
point
out
that
under
the
bankruptcy
act
the
decision...
our
position
in
this
case
was
endorsed
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
new
york.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
one
is,
you
make
take
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
court
could
reach
that
decision.
i
think
that
the
court
could
also
have
an
analysis
that
also
looked
to
the
question
of
whether
the
treatment
of
the
tax
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--an
excise--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
that's
the
test
that
congress
applies--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
creating
excise
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
in
deciding
what's
an
excise
tax,
we
should
apply
the
test
congress
applies,
but
may
i
please--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
then
they
made
it
waivable.
i'm
simply
saying
that
in
a
future
case,
not
in
this
case,
the
court
might
want
to
consider
whether
that's
relevant.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
address
it
here.
i
wouldn't
expect
it
to.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there's
really
another
point--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there's
another--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--may
i
just
make
one
more
point?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
in
united
states
v.
new
york,
the
court
addressed
the
same
question
that
it
has
to
address
here.
it
did
it
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
question
in
that
case
was
whether
an
excise
tax
that
is
designed
to
enforce
some
other
law
is
no
longer
an
excise
tax.
it's
no
longer
qualified
to
the
priority
as
a
tax,
it's
a
penalty,
and
what
the
court
said
in
united
states
v.
new
york
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
tax
is
designed
to
enforce
some
other,
in
this
case
state
law
doesn't
make
it,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
any
the
less
a
tax,
doesn't
remove
it
from
the
statutory
priority.
if
this
case
were
being
decided
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
that
analysis
in
united
states
v.
new
york
would
prevail
here,
because--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
sir,
that
was
a
federal
tax--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
was
a
federal
employment
tax
that
was
designed
to
enforce
a
state
unemployment
contribution
law.
the
tax
did
not
apply
if
the
state
law
had
been
complied
with.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
the
federal
employment
taxes
are
in
subtitle
c,
the
immediately
preceding
section,
which
is
also
an
excise
tax.
the
court
specifically
said
this
excise
tax
does
not
lose
its
priority.
it's
not
any
the
less
a
tax
because
it's
designed
to
do
something
else.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
it's
called
employment
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
not
its
caption.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
hard
for
me
to
answer
that
question.
this
is
a
tax
owed
by
the
pension.
no,
this
is
a
tax
owed
by
the
employer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
this
is
owed
by
the
employer.
i...
you're
asking
me
whether
it's
deductible.
i
don't
know.
i
have
no
reason
to
think
it
would...
would
not
be.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
i
agree,
that
would
be
some
evidence.
if
congress...
congress
as
a
general
proposition
doesn't
allow
the
deduction
of
penalties,
allows
the
deduction
of
ordinary
necessary
business
expenses.
i
don't
know
how
the...
i
don't
know
what
the
treatment
is
here.
in
mansfield
tire,
the
sixth
circuit
made
the
point
that
many,
if
not
most
federal
excises
have
a
punitive
or
regulatory
purpose.
if
congress
had
intended
to
exclude
all
of
its
excises
like
excises
on
gambling,
on
green
mail,
on
unregistered
securities
dealings,
you
would
reasonably
expect
to
see
some
evidence
of
that
in
the
text
or
the
legislative
history.
but
the
text
and
the
legislative
history
contain
the
unqualified
statement
that
any
excise,
federal,
state,
or
local,
that
has
been
expressly
treated
or
generally
accepted
as
an
excise
is
entitled
to
priority,
and
as
the
court
said
in
united
states
v.
new
york,
the
fact
that
this
excise
is
designed
to
enforce
a
penalty
doesn't
make
it
any
the
less
a
tax.
justice
breyer--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
under
chapter
7
priorities?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
you
deny
the
priority
on
the
grounds
it
was
a
penalty--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
you're
now
in
a
7--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
a
prepetition
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
of
course,
as
you've
already
pointed
out,
that
question
isn't
presented
here.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
it
had
been
presented--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
it
had
been
presented,
what
the
answer
that
some
courts
have
given
which
we
think
would
be
correct
is
that
when
you
cram
down,
if
you
will,
the
priorities
from
the
7
into
the
11,
what
the
courts
have
pointed
out
is
that
you
don't
do
that
to
the
extent
that
congress
expressly
intended
that
the
rules
that
are
applicable
to
7
should
not
apply
to
11.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir,
and
in...
and
my
point
is
that
in
a
chapter
11,
congress
made
the
express
determination
that
pecuniary...
nonpecuniary
loss,
prepetition
penalties
would
be
treated
as
general
unsecured
claims--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
not
be
treated
as--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
discuss
that
in
our
brief.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
remember
the
page,
but
if
you
compare
the
bills
as
they
progressed
through
congress--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
in
the
history
of
the
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
yes,
sir.
in
two
cases
that
we
cite
in
a
footnote
addressing
this
in
our
reply
brief--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
general
point
is
made,
and
we
also
point
out
the
history
in
our
opening
brief.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
have
two
brief
points
i
want
to
make.
the
claim
that
a
tax
that
effects
a
penalty
loses
its
priority
was
exactly
what
this
court
rejected
in
united
states
v.
new
york
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
bankruptcy
code
simply
makes
it
easier
to
understand
that
that's
the
correct
answer,
because
knowing
full
well
that
many
of
its
excises
are
penalty
or
regulatory
in
nature,
congress
adopted
an
unqualified
priority
for
excise
taxes.
we
have
to
establish
only
that
it's
an
excise
tax.
whether
it's
also
regarded
as
a
penalty
is
not
relevant
for
applying
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
the
court
held
in
united
states
v.
new
york
it
was
not
relevant
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
other
point--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--you
mean,
in
applying
the
excise
tax
priority?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
other
than
what
we've
already
discussed,
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
circumstances.
i
hate
to
make
categorical
statements,
but
i'm
not
familiar
with
any.
and
the
other
point
that
i
want
to
address
very
briefly
is
the
suggestion
that
this...
the
priority
for
this
excise
tax
is
unfair
because
it
comes
in
front
of
claims
of
employees
for
residual
retirement
benefits.
in
saying
that,
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
only
the
cost
of
the
tax,
and
utterly
ignored
its
benefit.
these
employees
not
only
get
the
promise
of
insurance,
they
get
the
fact
of
insurance.
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
comes
in
and
pays
benefits,
guaranteed
benefits.
the
employees
are
much
better
off
with
this
guarantee
system
in
effect,
including
the
priority
tax,
than
they
would
be
without
it.
no
one
doubts--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's...
but
for
the
insurance,
they
wouldn't
be
paid
at
all.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
without--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
sir.
they're
getting
paid
the
guaranteed
benefits
under
the
pension
benefit
system.
the
irs
tax,
which
is
designed
to
enforce
the
ability
of
the
united
states
to
honor
the
promise
to
ensure
benefits,
only
comes
in
in
front
of
residual
claims.
the
employees,
on
balance,
are
better
off.
they're
going
to
get
millions
of
dollars
in
benefits
by
the
insurance
function.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
