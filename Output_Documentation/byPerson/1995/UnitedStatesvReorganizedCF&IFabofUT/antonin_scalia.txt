justice
antonin
scalia
either
you
or
we.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
these
taxes
you
say
are
excise
taxes,
that's
well
established?
justice
antonin
scalia
more
problematic
than
whopping
big?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you're
not
willing
to
stand
by
the
proposition,
which
sort
of
makes
doubtful
whether
the
proposition
is
correct...
you're
not
willing
to
stand
by
the
proposition
that
everything
included
within
that
title
is
an
excise
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
happens
to
bear
that
title,
but
you're...
well,
the
100
percent
tax
you're
willing
to
say
is
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
answered
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you're
going
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
this
in
a
title
that
bears
the
caption,
excise
tax.
if
that
is
going
to
be
the...
you
know,
the
north
star
of
your
argument,
the
100
percent
is
covered.
otherwise,
you
have
to
abandon
that
and
say,
well,
it's
not
determinative.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
mean,
so
you
say
this
is
just
part
of
the
evidence.
this
alone
isn't
enough
to
get
you
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
but
what
test
does
congress
apply?
they
have
included
the
100-percent
tax
within
this
section
entitled
excise
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
once
you
abandon...
once
you're
not
willing
to
answer
yes
to
justice
souter's
question,
we're
just
quibbling
about
what
the
test
ought
to
be,
whether
it's
the
four
part
test
used
here,
or
we
should
make
up
another
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
really
no
alternative.
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
a...
in
this
same
section?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
included
in
this
same
section
of
the
code?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
anything
else
that
comes
under
sub
(b)
and
therefore
bears
the
label,
miscellaneous
excise
taxes,
which
you
would
assert
is
obviously
not
an
excise
tax,
as
you
do
the
100
percent,
and
as
you
do
the
10
percent,
for
that
matter?
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
comes
within
that
section
of
the
code
that
bears
the
caption,
miscellaneous
excise
taxes.
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
embraced
within
that,
are
there
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else
besides
this
10
percent
and
100
percent
strikes
you
as
obviously
not
an
excise
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
now,
wait,
act
or
event
or
transaction,
you're
willing
to
read
transaction
to
include
event?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
willing
to
include
it.
or
act?
can
it
be
an
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
an
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be...
a
transaction
involves...
you
then
do
not
think
that
estate
taxes
are
excise
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
impose
a
tax
on
the
sale
of,
or
the
purchase
of
jewelry,
that
would
be
an
excise
tax,
but
if
i
impose
a
tax
on
the
ownership
of
jewelry,
that
would
not
be
an
excise
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
above
a
certain
amount.
if
you
own
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
jewelry,
that
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
required
to
fund
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
other
penalty
for
not
funding
them?
