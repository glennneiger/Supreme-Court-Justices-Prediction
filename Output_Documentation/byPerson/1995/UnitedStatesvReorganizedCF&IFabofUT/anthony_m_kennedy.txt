the
government
suggested
that
as
to
the
100-percent
tax
it
has
an
equitable
component
within
the
tax.
that
is
to
say,
the
government
is
free
to
waive
the
collection
of
the
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
other
taxes
that
are
in
the
excise
subtitle
that
have
this
equitable
waiver,
or
equitable
feature
built
into
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't...
i
think
the
government
would
tell
you
that
it
has
no
discretion
to
waive
its
taxes,
other
than
in
the
one
instance
we're
discussing,
the
100-percent
tax,
and
so
it
would
seem
to
me
plausible
enough
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
say,
well,
there's
an
equitable
component
to
this
tax
which
can
be
waived,
and
i
am
going
to
equitably
subordinate
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
to
the
100
percent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
would
at
least
be
an
excise
tax
that
has
an
equitable
component,
which
is
not
like
other
excise
taxes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
some
discussion
in
the
briefs...
i
think
it's
507(a)(7)(g)...
relating
to
a
penalty
related
to
a
claim
of
a
kind
specified
in
this
paragraph
and
in
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
an
example--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
a
tax
to
which
that
would
apply?
