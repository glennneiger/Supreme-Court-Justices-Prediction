justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i
ask
a
question...
at
some
point,
when
you
can...
a
technical
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
you
bet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
a
state
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you...
that's
all
right.
suppose,
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
thought
because
it's
regulatory
in
nature,
it's
object
is
zero
dollars,
it
doesn't
want
to
collect
revenue,
and
because
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
on
an
activity,
though
there
are
things
on
your
side,
too,
which
you
very
well
argued,
but
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
were
to
say
it
was
an
excise
tax,
then
we'd
get
to
the
next
part
of
the
case.
now,
the
technical
question
on
the
next
part
of
the
case,
assuming
that
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
got
there,
under
section
7
priorities,
i
would
have
decided
that
this
was
a
penalty,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
yes,
under
chapter
7
i
would
have
decided
this
was
a
penalty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
it
would
have
come
in
the
fourth
priority
after
unsecured
creditors,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
why
in
this
section,
in
this
chapter
11
case
didn't
the
bankruptcy
judge
just
say,
this
is
a
penalty,
therefore
i
put
it
in
a
different
class.
i
put
it
in
a
class
which
would
be
the
class
it
would
be
in
if
this
were
a
chapter
7.
i
put
it
in
a
class
below
unsecured
creditors,
and
therefore
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
equitable
subordination
or
not,
and
since
he
could
have
just
as
easily
done
that,
which
would
have
come
to
the
identical
thing,
he
just
used
the
wrong
words
to
describe
what
he
did,
and
therefore
that
issue
drops
out
of
the
case.
that's
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what
are
we
supposed
to
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
wait,
we've
assumed
in
this,
we've
assumed
in
this
for
the
sake
of
my
question
that
this
is
nothing
other
than
a
simple
penalty--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
a
nonpecuniary
nature.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
does
it
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
where
in
the
language
of
the
statute
does
it
do
that?
anywhere?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
case...
is
there
any
case
which
has
said
that
we
lack
the
power
in
chapter
11
to
treat--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
the
same
question
i
asked
the
solicitor
general,
because
assuming
that
i
agreed
with
you,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
agreed
it
was
not
a
tax,
but
rather
it
was
a
penalty,
because
it
collects
zero
dollars
as
its
objective.
assume
that.
now,
on
that
assumption,
i
found
it
very
difficult
to
reach
the
question
of
equitable
subordination
without
deciding
whether
or
not
the
bankruptcy
judge
would
have
the
power
to
create
a
subcategory
that
would
rank
this
kind
of
penalty
below
the
unsecured
creditors,
or
you
raised
that.
they
replied,
i
take
it,
in
footnote
14
of
their
reply
brief,
and
they
cite
a
bunch
of
cases,
but
they
cite
them
for
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
set
up
a
subclassification
of
claims
within
a
class
of
equal
priority.
of
course
that's
true--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
that
particular
argument.
namely,
they
deny
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
would
have
the
power
in
chapter
11
to
create
a
subclass
of
the
penalties
below
the
unsecured
creditor,
and
i
don't
know
if
these
cases
stand
for
that
specific
application
of
the
general
proposition,
or
if
they
do
not,
and
i
don't
know
enough
about
bankruptcy
law
to
know
how
well
settled
that
kind
of
question
is,
and
that
kind
of
question
seems
to
me
to
be
prior
to
a
definition
of
the
word
equitable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if,
in
fact,
since
i'm...
i
have
to...
we
have
to
decide
this
case,
and
if
you
win
on
the
first
issue,
and
then
i
get
to
that,
and
i
read
the
cases,
and
i
think
they're
indeterminate,
what
am
i,
or
what
would
you
think
this
court
should
do?
shouldn't
we...
i
mean,
to
answer
the
question
of
what's
equitable
without
hanging
in
the
air
seems
difficult.
should
we
remand
the
case?
should
we
then
say,
go
back
and
work
this
out,
because
we
don't
need
to
decide
whether
it's
equitable
or
not
when
you
have
a
perfectly
good
ground
for
reaching
the
same
result.
what
is
it,
in
your
opinion,
we
should
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
really
argue...
i
mean,
it's
come
up
here
under
this
other
pretense.
that
is,
the
question
presented
was...
so
it
would
be
rather
hard
to
affirm
on
that
ground,
wouldn't
it?
wouldn't
we
have
to
send
it
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
sheppard's
tax
dictionary
does
have
a
definition
for
minimum
funding
excise
tax
which,
it
refers
to
this
particular
provision,
so
the
tax
community
as
reflected
by
the
tax
dictionary
calls
it
an
excise
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
withholding
taxes,
that's...
is
that...
the
corporation
withholds
its
employees
taxes,
then
it
doesn't
pay
them,
and
the
person
who
owes
the
tax
is
the
employee,
and
the
code
refers
to
the
money
that
the
corporation
should
have
withheld,
which,
of
course,
is
the
tax
that
the
employee
owed,
as
a
penalty,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
idea
of
pecuniary
penalties?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
the
only
things
that
are
pecuniary
penalties
are
these
instances
where
a
corporation
is
to
withhold
a
tax
that
somebody
else
owes,
and
the
code
refers
to
that
as
a
penalty,
or
those
as
penalties?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't
insure
all
of
them.
they
don't
insure
all.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
have
pensions
whose
pensions
won't
be
paid,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
without
insurance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
to
say,
aren't
there
some
people
here,
employees,
who
won't
get
paid,
and
the
reason
they
won't
get
paid
their
promised
benefit
is
because
the
irs
is
going
to
collect
this
tax?
