justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
jones,
it
does
have
one
qualification,
and
that
is,
it
uses
the
word
transaction,
rather
than
act
or
event,
and
i
mean,
just
in
common
uses
that
implies
something
more,
doesn't
it,
than
the
passage
of
the
deadline
without
payment?
would
we
normally
describe
that
as
a
transaction?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
use
the
word
transaction?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
the
failure
to
fund
on
by
that
date
which
is
the
event?
it
is
not
the
mere
maintenance
over
some
period
of
time,
it's
the
failure
to
bring
it
up
to
the
proper
level--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
that
reporting
date.
justice
david
h.
souter
--of
course,
maybe
the
point
for
your
side
is
that
no
one
has
come
up
with
a
reason
why
congress
would
want
to
draw
the
line
between
an
excise
payable,
excise
tax
payable
on
a
failure
to
do
something
as
distinct
from
an
excise
tax
payable
because
of
some
affirmative
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
at
least,
i
don't
have
an
idea.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
(b)
tax
expressly
labeled
an
excise
tax?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
doesn't...
the
word
excise
is
not
in
that
section,
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
also
applies
to
(b).
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
we
buy
(a),
i
think
we're
buying
(b).
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
in
any
event,
your
point
is
not
that
the
designation
is
controlling.
the
designation
is
important,
but
it's
not
controlling--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but
one
thing
we
can't
do
is
adopt
a
rule
of
decision
which
says
(a)
has
been
designated
by
its
location
as
an
excise
tax,
end
of
issue.
we
can't
decide
on
that
basis.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
depending
on
how
narrowly
you
read
that,
this
either
is
or
is
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--expressly
treated,
but
we
couldn't
take
the
designation
rule
without
picking
up
(b)
as
well,
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
begs
the
question.
it
has
not
expressly
treated
it.
in
the
section
itself,
the
closest
to
express
treatment,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
is
its
placement
in
subsection
d,
which
has
an
excise
tax
label,
and
therefore,
if
we
use
the
placement
in
subsection
d
as
the
ground
of
decision,
then
we're
going
to
pick
up
the
(b)
tax
as
well
as
the
(a),
and
you
don't
want
us,
i
take
it,
to
be
forced
to
decide
on
that
ground.
if
i'm
wrong,
if
you
say
look,
i'll
take...
i
want
the
whole
hog,
and
you
should
decide
on
the
ground
of
that
placement,
then
i
want
you
to
tell
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
may
i
just
interrupt
you,
because
i
want
to
get
clear
on
one
thing.
it's
the
same
thing
that
justice
scalia
and
justice
stevens
wants
to
get
clear
on.
yes
or
no.
you
should
decide
this
case
under
a
rule
of
decision
that
says,
if
it's
placed
under
d,
it's
an
excise
tax,
end
of
issue.
is
that
the
position
that
you
take,
or
is
it
not
the
position
that
you
take?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it's
yes
or
no.
you
can
only
have
one
answer.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
guess
the
answer
is
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
the
answer
is
no.
but
see,
mr.
jones,
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think
it
really
is
clearly
labeled
an
excise
tax,
but
they
said,
we
apply
a
four
part
test
from
cassidy
or
some
earlier
case,
and
you're
saying
don't
apply
a
four
part
test,
apply
an
act
or
event
test.
you're
just
saying
they
applied
the
wrong
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
congress
want
to
draw
that
distinction
between
a
tax
which
becomes
payable
as
a
result
of
nonaction
and
the
expiration
of
time,
and
the
tax
which
becomes
payable
because
of
an
affirmative
act,
or
perhaps
even
an
affirmative
agreement,
if
that's
applied
by
one
sense,
a
transaction.
why
draw
that
kind
of
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
is
the
transfer
of
property
into
an
estate
the
result
of
a
transaction?
it's
the
result
of
a
disposition
by
someone
who
is
now
dead,
and
it's
the
result
of
an
acceptance,
i
suppose,
by
an
administrator,
but
the
two
in
their
respective
capacities
never
meet,
so
there
isn't
any
real
transaction
in
the
sense
of
the
characteristically
consensual
act
of
two
parties.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we're
getting
a
little
bit
attenuated.
