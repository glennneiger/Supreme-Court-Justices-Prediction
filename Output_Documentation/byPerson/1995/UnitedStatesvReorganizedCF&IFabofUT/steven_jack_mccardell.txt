mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
irs
claim
to
tax
priority
in
this
case
rests
on
the
single
assumption
identified
in
the
questions
of
the
last
argument.
that
is,
that
every
exaction
labeled
a
tax
in
section
4971,
because
of
its
placement
under
the
heading,
miscellaneous
excise
taxes,
is
automatically
and
without
further
consideration
entitled
to
the
tax
priority
in
bankruptcy.
the
questioning
in
the
last
argument
i
think
revealed
that
the
100-percent
exaction
imposed
under
sub
(b)
of
section
4971
is
indistinguishable
from
the
exaction
under
sub
(a)
on
the
basis
of
its
labels,
and
if
the
irs
can
concede
that
the
label
alone
does
not
control
with
regard
to
sub
(b),
that
concedes
the
case,
if
label
is
the
irs'
sole
argument,
which
it
must
be
in
this
case,
because
of
the
concessions
that
the
irs
made
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
the
only
exaction
under
sub
(b)
is
the
100
percent
item
designated
as
a
tax.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
well,
there
are
other
tiered
penalties.
for
example,
section
4941
tiered
tax
on
self
dealing.
it
imposes
a
first
tier
penalty
and
a
second
tier
penalty.
both
of
them
are
designated
as
taxes.
those
are
the
exactions
that
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
under
the
bankruptcy
act
were
not
entitled
to
tax
priority.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
we
do,
your
honor,
because
both
were
asserted
in
this
case.
the
(a)
provision
which
is
before
the
court
today
is
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$1.2
million,
the
(b)
provision
for
about
another
$40
million,
was
in
the
amount
emphasized...
asserted
in
this
case.
the
reason
the
irs
must
rely
on
its
labels
govern
argument
is
that
the
irs
conceded
in
the
lower
court
that
it
would
not
be
able
to
sustain
the
position
that
these
exactions
are
not
penalties.
that
concession
is
found
at
pages
48
and
49.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
your
honor,
the
irs
did
not
come
forward
with
any
evidence
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
satisfy
the
court's
traditional
test
for
the
tax
priority
in
bankruptcy.
having
failed
to
meet
its
burden
to
prove
its
entitlement
to
the
priority,
i
think
the
irs
is
bound
by
that
failure.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
and
both
occurred
in
this
case.
the
traditional
test
for
tax
priority
requires
that
the
exaction
have
the
purpose
of
supporting
the
government.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
we
do
not,
your
honor.
the
rule
adopted
by
the--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--there
are,
and
in
the
cases
of
those
taxes
they
have
a
mixed
purpose,
both
regulatory
and
to
raise
revenue.
section
4971
is
distinct
in
that
regard,
in
that
it
has
only
a
function
of
coercing
and
punishing
the
failure
to--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--if
it's
ever
paid,
it
certainly
goes
into
the
treasury.
however,
it's
not
used
to
fund
pensions
or
to
otherwise
address
the
question
of
retiree
claims.
now--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--certainly.
first,
if
i
might
address
the
end
of
justice
o'connor's
question,
which
i
think
addresses
the
question
of
what
the
bankruptcy
code
does
with
regard
to
penalty
claims,
subsection
(g)
of
section
507(a)(7)
the
court
has
before
it
today
distinguishes
between
penalties
that
have
a
pecuniary
loss,
and
penalties
that
are
not
based
on
a
pecuniary
loss.
now,
it's
clear
that
if
there
could
never
be...
if
the
simple
fact
that
it's
paid
into
the
treasury
of
the
government
always
made
it
a
tax
simply
because
the
government
receives
revenue,
then
there
never
could
be
such
a
thing
as
a
nonpecuniary
loss
penalty,
but
(g)
demonstrates
that
there
is
such
a
distinction,
and
that's
why,
in
looking
at
section
4971,
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
the
court
can
look
at
objective
characteristics
of
this
tax
that
demonstrate
that
it
does
not
satisfy
the
traditional
test
for
taxes.
it
was...
first,
the
united
states
is
not
liable
for
the
pensions
that
are
guaranteed.
they
are
guaranteed
by
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation,
which
operates
on
private
funds.
the
penalty,
if
paid,
goes
to
the
irs,
but
not
to
the
pbgc
or
to
the
plans
or
to
the
retirees.
if
the
section
4971
penalty
is
paid,
the
underlying
obligation
to
fund
the
plan
remains,
and
in
that
regard
it's
different
from
the
responsible
officer
penalty
addressed
in
the
prior
case,
which
can
only
be
collected
once.
this
one
is
collected
twice.
it
says
to
the
employer,
you
fund
your
pension
plan,
or
if
you
don't
you're
still
going
to
have
to
fund
it,
or
the
next
year
you're
going
to
have
to
fund
it
at
110
percent,
you
have
to
pay
110
percent
penalty,
or
the
next
year
220
percent,
and
so
on.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
the
test,
your
honor,
is
whether
it
qualifies
as
a
tax.
the
court
has
distinguished
taxes
from
penalties
by
defining
it--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--the
test
is
that
stated
in
united
states
v.
new
york,
that
a
tax
is
a
pecuniary
burden
laid
upon
individuals
or
property
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
the
government,
by
whatever
name
it
may
be
called.
that's
the
test.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
if
the
court
addresses
the
question
of
transaction,
which
we
think
it
should,
because
that
is
encompassed
within
the
question
before
the
court
today,
it's
an
element
of
qualifying
for
tax
priority,
the
irs
loses.
there
was
no
transaction.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
the
irs's
proof
of
claim
in
this
case
identified
when
this
tax
arose,
and
that
date
was
september
15,
1990,
at
the
end
of
that
day,
when
no
payment
was
made...
at
midnight
on
september
15,
1990.
at
11:59
p.m.
on
that
day,
there
was
no
tax.
at
12:01
the
next
day,
there
was
a
tax.
what
happened
in
between?
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
that's
the
end
of
the
period
within
which
the
debtor
could
have
made
that
final
payment,
and
in
between
those
two--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--yes.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
yes.
your
honor,
the
end
of
the
plan
year
was
december
31,
1989,
but
erisa
allows
the
funding
payments
for
that
year
to
be
made
up
until
september
15
of
the
following
year.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
that's
what
their
proof
of
claim
says,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
but
it's
apparent
from
the
language
of
section
507(a)(7)(e)
that
that
line,
indeed,
was
drawn
because
of
the
language,
transaction
occurring,
and
perhaps
it's
based
on
the
distinction
the
solicitor
general
points
to
that
most
excise
taxes
are
based
on
an
act
or
event,
or
a
transaction.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
we
are
not.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
nor--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--nor
an
act,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
i
wondered
that
as
i
studied
for
this
case,
your
honor,
and
although
it's
not
cited
in
the
briefs
and
i
don't
have
the
statute
here
today,
my
recollection
of
the
estate
tax
statute
is
that
it's
imposed
on
the
transfer
into
the
estate,
which
is
a
transaction.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
under
the
ordinary
standard--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--ordinarily,
it
would
be
understood
as
a
property
tax.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
there
is
an
exchange
in
the
sense
of
the
death
creates
an
estate,
and
to
the
estate
goes
the
decedent's
property,
and
that
is
described
in
the
code
as
a
transfer.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
yes,
your
honor,
and
with
regard
to
the
section
4971
imposition,
it's
made
not
based
on
any
transaction,
simply
in
this
case
on
the
failure
to
make
a
payment.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
i
do,
your
honor.
these
impositions
are
not
deductible,
and
the
cross
reference
in
section
4971
is
to
section
275.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
that's
true.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
there
are
very
few
just
like
this
one,
because
this
one
is
imposed
only
when
another
statute
is
violated.
section
302
of
erisa
requires
that
a
plan
sponsor
fund
its
pension
plan,
and
it's
only
in
violating
that
statutory
obligation
that
this
exaction
is
imposed,
so
that
many
of
the
other
excise
taxes
imposed
under
the
code
which
may
have
a
regulatory
or
a
deterrent
effect
simply
wouldn't
be
covered
by
this
case
because
they're
not
based
on...
they're
not
exacted
on
unlawful
conduct.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
section
162
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
we
have
addressed
in
our
brief,
generally
provides
for
the
deductibility
of
taxes
but
not
penalties.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
that's
correct.
they
are
expressly
made
not
deductible.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
that
is
a
distinction--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me,
however,
that
the
capacity
of
a
creditor
to
waive
its
claim
always
exists
with
regard
to
any
claim,
and
that
applying
that
as
a
distinction
really
would
allow
a
creditor
to
determine--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--and
that,
in
fact,
did
occur
in
this
case.
the
bankruptcy
court--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--did
subordinate
under
section
510(c)
both
the
100-percent
and
the
10-percent
penalties.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
it's
true
that
the...
only
the
(b)
portion
of
this
exaction
is
waivable
by
the
government.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
it's--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--those
cases
do
not
stand
for
that
proposition,
your
honor,
and
i
should
acknowledge
that
this...
in
this
case,
the
irs's
claim
was
subordinated
in
two
independent
ways,
not
just
equitable
subordination
under
510(c),
but
also
was
subordinated
under
the
plan.
there
was
a
subordinated
class
created
for
nonpecuniary
loss
penalties.
into
that
class
the
irs's
claims
were
placed,
so
that
the
irs,
by
never
objecting
to
that
class,
really
left
the
issue
as
having
been
resolved
by
the--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--your
honor,
the
court
need
not
look
to
equitable
grounds
if
it
reaches
that
question,
because
two
statutes
in
chapter
11
both
permitted
and
required
the
subordination
that
occurred
here.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
confirmation
order,
which
is
one
of
the
three
orders.
the
order
approving
the
plan
is
one
of
the
three
orders
on
appeal
today,
so
that
by
affirming
the
confirmation
order,
the
court
will
approve
the
subordination
that's
provided
for
in
the
plan.
it's
difficult
for
us
to
understand
why
the
irs
doesn't
want
to
address
it,
but
it
is
an
independent
ground
for
subordination
that
really
does
exist
in
the
plan,
and
really
was...
really
occurred
in
this
case,
so
that
by
reaching...
by
simply
considering
the
confirmation
order
as
one
of
the
three
orders,
the
court
does
have
that
issue
before
it.
the
two
statutes
which
provide
for
that
subordination
are
section
1122,
which
provides
that
claims
may
not
be
placed
in
a
class
unless
they're
substantially
similar.
well,
these
claims
are
not
substantially
similar
to
the
general
unsecured
claims,
first
because
they
don't
represent
a
pecuniary
loss,
and
second,
because
they
have
different
priorities
in
the
liquidation.
further,
section
1129(a)(7)
of
the
code
gives
them...
requires
that
the
bankruptcy
code
consider,
in
confirming
a
plan,
what
the
liquidation
results
would
be,
and
as
the
irs
has
conceded
in
the
chapter
7
case,
penalty
claims
not
entitled
to
priority
would
be
subordinated.
thus,
that
result
is
required
in
a
case
of
this
nature,
and
those
two
statutory
grounds,
rather
than
any
outside
equitable
factors,
would
be
appropriate
grounds
for
affirmance
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
we're
not
saying
that,
your
honor,
and
that's
because
chapter
11
has
a
specific
requirement
that
a
chapter
11
plan
pay
in
full
all
taxes,
which
this
plan
says
it
will
do.
that's
found
in
section
1129(a)(9)(c)
of
the
code,
so
that
we
are
not
making
that
argument.
our
argument,
then,
simply
rests
on
the
court's
traditional
longstanding,
well
accepted
test
for
the
definition
of
taxes.
the
irs
has
never
explained
why
congress
intended
to
legislatively
overrule
the
court's
precedents
defining
taxes.
there's
no
definition
for
tax
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
where
the
bankruptcy
code
intends
to
incorporate
a
specific
definition
from
the
internal
revenue
code
or
any
other
federal
statute,
it
does
so
expressly
so
that...
and
a
further
significant
factor
in
this
case
is
that
the
kinds
of
claims
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case
were
simply
disallowed
entirely
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
and
to
suggest
that
by
saying
nothing
congress
intended
to
suddenly
elevate
those
claims
to
the
seventh
priority
is
quite
a
stretch,
as
we
view
the
development
of
the
law.
the
legislative
history
on
which
the
irs
relies
time
after
time
in
its
brief
simply
says
that
exactions
that
are
taxes
may...
are
covered
by
this
priority
if
they're
excises,
but
they
must
be
taxes
first,
and
so
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
with
regard
to
this
exaction
the
traditional
test,
which
the
irs
conceded
in
the
lower
courts
it
did
not
satisfy,
and
did
not...
never
came
forward
with
any
evidence
that
it
satisfied
that
test,
which
was
its
burden
as
the
claimant
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
your
honor,
it
certainly
has
been
treated
in
various
ways
as
an
excise
tax,
but
not
even
the
tax
practitioners
would
agree
that
a
tax
of
this
nature
is
a
tax
for
all
purposes
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
we've
cited
the
conflicting
line
of
cases
on
similar
taxes
in
the
third
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit,
the
latterman
case
and
the
rockefeller
case,
where
there
is
disagreement
that
taxes
like
this
may
not
even
be
taxes
for
purposes
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
so
that
in
view
of
that
kind
of
a
disagreement
in
a
tax
of
this
nature,
it's
difficult
to
say
that
you
then
import
that
concept
into
the
bankruptcy
code
when
the
tax
code
does
not
settle
bankruptcy
priorities.
that's
settled
by
the
statute
and
the
court's
decisions
interpreting
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
i
don't
know
that
it
does
make
a
difference,
your
honor,
although,
as
i
said
in
addressing
taxes
of
this...
penalty
excise
taxes
of
this
nature,
the
third
and
eighth
circuits
have
disagreed
on
the
question
of
whether
they
are
taxes
even
for
purposes
of
the
internal
revenue
code's
provisions
calculating
interest
on
those
taxes.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
yes.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
yes,
i
can.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
i
can,
your
honor.
an
example
would
be
the
responsible
officer
penalty
exacted
under
6672.
it
represents
an
assessment
of
100
percent
against
the
officer,
responsible
officer,
of
the
taxes
that
should
have
been
paid
by
the
corporation.
the
government
gets
what
it
would
have
received
if
the
law
had
been
obeyed
and,
indeed,
the
senate
finance
committee
report,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
in
describing
pecuniary
loss
penalties,
describes
them
as
any
fine
or
penalty,
however
denominated,
which
actually
represent
the
collection
of
a
tax.
that's
the
concept
we
believe
is
codified
in
section
50--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--that's
correct.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
it's
what
the
government
would
have
received
if
the
law
had
been...
the
tax
that
would
have
been
collected
if
the
law
had
been
obeyed.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
i
can
think
of
another
example
of
possible
pecuniary
loss
penalty,
and
that
is
an
exaction
under
the
internal
revenue
code
that
simply
represents
interest
on
a
tax
that
should
have
been
paid
and
compensates--
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
--for
the
delay
in
payment.
that
would
be
a...
but
this
kind
of
exaction
is
distinct.
--it
doesn't
compensate
any
delay
in
payment.
it
doesn't
compensate
any
tax
that
was
not
collected.
congress
did
not
enact
section
4971(a)
with
the
idea
that
individuals
would
not
fund
their
pension
plans
and
that
the
irs
would
then
collect
revenue.
instead,
it
passed
the
statute
with
the
idea
that
individuals
who
had
sponsored
pension
plans
would
fund
them,
and
that
that
funding
would
go
to
pay
retirees.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
yes,
they
are.
that's
found
in
section
302
of
erisa.
mr.
steven
jack
mccardell
they...
there's
no
criminal
penalty,
your
honor,
but
that
under
section
502
of
erisa
the
failure
to
fund
may
be
enforced
by
a
civil
action,
including
injunctive
proceedings,
so
that
it
is
a
statutory
obligation
which,
if
violated,
gives
rise
to
these
escalating
penalties.
now,
in
this
case,
the...
not
only
did
the
irs
fail
to
meet
the
traditional
test
for
taxes,
fail
to
establish
that
a
transaction
had
occurred,
but
in
asserting
these
claims,
would
have
taken
funds
right
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
creditors,
and
many
of
those
creditors
include
the
very
retirees
who
are
intended
to
be
protected
by
this
statute.
we
don't
think,
all
other
things
being
considered
in
this
case,
it
makes
sense
for
the
court
to
adopt
a
rule
which
would
reach
that
result.
nothing
in
the
statue
requires
that
the
court
read
section
507
to
require
that
any
label
in
a
nonbankruptcy
statute
governs
priority
in
bankruptcy.
the
court's
cases,
from
the
embassy
restaurant
case,
to
the
nathanson
case,
to
the
simonson
case,
all
clearly
specify
that
the
court's
mode
of
analysis
over
many
years
has
been
to
say
that
it's
bankruptcy
law
that
establishes
bankruptcy
priorities,
and
labels
or
meanings
or
understandings
in
nonbankruptcy
statutes
while,
perhaps,
evidence,
are
not
controlling.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
in
this
case,
and
we
believe
the
court
should
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
