justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
agree
that
language
doesn't
always
control,
that
something
can
be
called
a
tax
and,
in
fact,
be
a
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it
was
a
nonpecuniary
loss--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
there
is
an
additional
so
called
tax
under
the
erisa
scheme.
where
the
initial
tax
isn't
corrected
within
a
certain
time,
then
there's
imposed
a
tax
equal
to
100
percent
of
the
accumulated
funding
deficiency.
now,
what's
the
transaction
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
come
on,
we
have
to
have
that
in
mind.
it's
in
the
very
next
section--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
you
know
we're
going
to
face
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
looks
something
like
a
penalty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
in
the
other,
the
10
percent,
either.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
every
exaction
adopted
under
26
u.s.
code
section
4971,
subtitle
d,
is
a
penalty,
not
a
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
can't
be
the
case.
suppose
it's
a
tax
on
alcohol
or
cigarettes.
it's
a
tax
designed
to
encourage
people
not
to
smoke
or
not
to
drink,
some
kind
of
a
sin
tax.
do
you
say
that
those
aren't
excise
taxes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
aren't
there
plenty
of
excise
taxes
that
are
designed
for
the
very
purpose
of
encouraging
certain
behavior,
or
discouraging
certain
behavior?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
raises
revenue
for
uncle
sam.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
think
what--
--well,
but
we've
never
required
that.
that
would
be
constructing
some
other
new--
--what
justice
o'connor
is
suggesting
is,
how
can
we
tell
whether
the
purpose
of...
it's
easy
to
say
that
this
tax
has
a,
you
know,
an
encouraging
or
discouraging
function.
how
can
we
say
that
it
isn't
for
the
purpose
of
raising
tax
revenue?
i
don't
know
how
to
figure
out
whether
it
is
or
isn't.
i
know
that
it
does
raise
tax
revenue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
call
it
a
penalty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
you're
calling
it
a
penalty.
that's
what
we
have
to
decide,
and
what's
the
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes.
what
is
the
test
for
determining
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
this,
are
all
taxes
deductible
by
the
person
paying
the
taxes
if
they're
engaged
in
business?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
penalties
are
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it's
your
position
that
neither
the
10-percent
exaction
nor
the
100-percent
exaction
in
this
erisa
section
are
deductible.
