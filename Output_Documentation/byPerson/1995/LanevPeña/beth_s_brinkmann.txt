ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
rehabilitation
act
does
not
contain
the
waiver
the
petitioner
seeks.
the
act
is
silent
regarding
the
remedies
available
against
the
federal
government
for
violation
of
section
504.
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
for
the
several
reasons
i
think
that
members
of
the
court
were
suggesting,
we
interpret
that
not
to
extend
to
federal
executive
agencies,
programs
or
activities
conducted
by
federal
executive
agencies
under
section
794.
first
of
all,
the
word
such--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we...
no,
we
do
not
agree
that
damages
are
necessarily
available
against
a
federal
funder.
damages
would
be
available,
but
whether...
no
court
has
held
that
you
can
get
damages
against
a
federal
agency
that's
providing
funds.
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
in
fact,
the
courts
are
not
even
in
agreement
on
whether
or
not
there's
implied
cause
of
action
for
a
federal
funding
agency.
the
courts
have...
and
this
court
did
not
resolve
that
issue
in
cannon.
however,
we
do
believe
that
there
would
be
a
remedy
against
a
federal
fund
provider
in
that
situation
either
for
injunctive
relief...
certainly
the
apa
would
provide
that
background.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
and
title
vi
remedies
against
federal
providers,
your
honor,
include
things
such
as
remedies
for
the
fund
recipient,
when
the
fund
recipient
is
challenging
the
cutoff
of
funds
or
action
by
the
federal
fund
provider.
there
are
lots
of
remedies
under
title
vi,
but
we
don't
concede
that
there...
even
in
that
situation,
which
i
think
the
court
realizes
is
very
different
than
the
situation
before
it
now,
but
in
that
situation--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
think
what
congress
is
trying
to
do
in
subsection
(a)(2),
your
honor,
was
make
section
504
like
title
vi
and
title
ix.
there's
this
mechanism
for
providing
funds
to
agencies
and
states,
and
what
remedies
are
available
under
that
are
under
title
vi
2000d-1,
where
it
sets
up...
for
example,
a
recipient
of
federal
funds
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
some
due
process
before
those
funds
could
be
cut
off.
we
think
that
the
structure
of
the
language
clearly
reinforces
our
interpretation.
we
would
focus
first
on
the
word
such
in
that
subsection
(2).
i
think
as
justice
scalia
was
pointing
out,
federal
provider
of
such
a
system
we
believe
refers
back
to
the
earlier
clause
talking
about
the
federal
assistance.
we
would
also
point
out,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
the
contrast
between
the
language
with
subsection
(a)(1),
where
title
vii
remedies
were
incorporated
for
employment
discrimination
against
the
federal
government.
in
that
section,
(a)(1)
is
written
broadly,
that
those
remedies
are
available
for
any
complaint
under
section
791,
and
certainly,
if
congress'
intent
had
been
as
petitioner
states,
that
would
have
been
the
language
they
used
in
(2)
for
any
complaint
under
section
794.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
the
question
would
be,
your
honor,
the
way
to
analyze
it
is
to
see
what
remedies
are
available
under
title
vi,
and
i
think
calling
it
damages,
what
makes
me
hesitate,
i
think
it
would
be
a
question,
for
example,
under
bowen
v.
massachusetts
whether
or
not
there
could
be
some
monetary
relief,
perhaps
as
an
injunctive,
requiring
the
agency
either
to
provide
funds
or
not
provide
funds,
but
it's
not
a
damages
remedy--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
perhaps.
i
think
a
really
significant
feature
of
the
act,
your
honor,
that
you
raise
in
my
mind
when
you
point
that
out
is
the
expressed
waiver
of
compensatory
damages
that
congress
enacted
in
1991
for
section
501.
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991,
congress
made
very
clear
that
it
was
waiving
damages,
sovereign
immunity
for
compensatory
damages
for
claims
under
section
501,
and
it
puts
significant
limitations
on
that
waiver.
first
of
all,
it's
limited
to
intentional
discrimination,
or
in
the
case
of
a
501,
a
rehabilitation
act
claim,
also
the
failure
to
reasonably
accommodate.
the
text
of
this
is
on
pages
5a
through
7a
of
our
brief.
that's
the
1991
civil
rights
act.
in
addition
to
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
don't
believe
so
under
the
broad
definition
of
that
subsection
(a)(2).
it
certainly
provides
assistance
to
various
programs
and
activities,
but
under
(a)(2),
we
submit
that
that
only
refers
to
federal
providers
of
the
assistance
to
the
recipient,
and
again,
we
will
contrast
that
to
the
language
in
(a)(1).
and
i'd
also
remind
the
court,
i
think
as
justice
ginsburg
was
pointing
out,
there
is
the
ada
waiver
as
a
background
to
this,
and
i
think
it's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
something
the
court
needs
to
resolve
in
this
case.
in
cannon,
darrone,
alexander
v.
choate,
the
court
has
just
assumed
that
there
were
causes
of
action
implied.
we
would
certainly
say
that
there's
no
doubt
that
there's
one
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
the
amendment
to
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
made
clear
that
waiver
for
nonmonetary
damages
was
enacted
in
1976,
just
shortly
before
this
1978
amendment
for--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
a...
no.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
is.
actually,
your
honor,
in
darrone,
the
way
the
court
interpreted
the
availability
of
back
pay
was
as
an
equitable
remedy,
because
that's
the
way
it
had
been
interpreted
under
title
vii.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
there
are
several
opinions
of
this
court
that
i
think
hold
to
the
contrary.
for
example,
library
of
congress
v.
shaw.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
would
point
to
the
attorney's
fees
as
the
most
easily
resolved,
your
honor.
on
page...
under
794a(b)
it's
an
express
waiver
of
attorney's
fees
by
a
prevailing
party.
we
would
also
point
out
under
the
apa--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--(b).
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
there's
also,
of
course,
a
waiver
under
the
administrative
procedures
act
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
going
to
the
point
about
the
waiver
for
money
damages
i
would
also
point
out,
your
honor,
in
addition
to
the
library
of
congress
v.
shaw
there's
the
court's
opinion
in
lehman
v.
nakshian
about
the
jury
trial
right
under
the
ada,
and
again,
that
was
a
situation
in
which
the
statute
talked
about
the
federal
government
in
the
same
terms
as
private,
that
they
would
be
liable
for
legal
and
equitable
remedies,
but
as
in
shaw,
where
it
was
the
same
language,
the
united
states
would
be
responsible
as
all
other
parties.
the
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized,
however,
that
the
aspects
of
the
sovereign
immunity
waiver
has
to
be
express,
and
although
the
court
had
implied
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
for
private
defendants
in
a
earlier
case,
lorillard,
the
court
did
not
imply
that
against
the
federal
government
in
lehman,
and
also,
we
think
that
shaw
is
a,
you
know,
statutory
issue
concerning
interest,
but
we
think
that
the
thrust
of
that
court
also
supports
us
here.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mm
hmm.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
my
first
answer,
it
doesn't
matter,
but
i'll
answer
directly
then
explain
why.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
looking
at
the
history
of
that
provision,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
intent
would
not
include
federal--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--executive
agencies
of
the
federal
government.
yes.
because
the
statutes
that
are
referred
to
in
(a)(1)
of
that
are
all
federal
funding
provisions,
and
the
other--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--right.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
acknowledge
that,
your
honor,
and
if
the
plain
language
has
to
be
interpreted
to
include
the
federal
government,
we
don't
believe
that
that
makes
any
difference,
as
members
of
the
court
were
pointing
out.
that
simply
means
that
in
an
action
against
a
state,
the
plaintiff
gets
the
same
remedies
that
are
available
in
actions
against
a
private
entity
or
a
public
entity--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--and
their
injunctive--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--now,
we
would
say
that
there
were
damage
remedies
available
against
private
entities
that
were
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
just
don't
think
it--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
look
at
the
word,
or,
your
honor,
private
or...
public
or
private
entity.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
only
get
the
overlap,
everything
that
you
can
get
in
both
of
those
against
public
or
private,
it's
that
against
a
state
you
can
get
any
remedy
that
you
can
get
against
any
private
entity,
or
against
any
public
entity,
and
you
can
get
damages
against
private
entities,
or,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
municipalities--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--right.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
the
problem
you're
suggesting
would
arise
if
it
said
public
and
private,
but
it
says
public
or
private.
it's
simply
making--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
the
greater,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--necessary
interpretation
for
purposes
here,
and
under
the
court's
authority
for
the
explicit
nature
of
a
waiver
we
would
again
contrast
to
this
the
explicit
waiver
for
compensatory
damages
for
employment
discrimination.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
i
think
it
probably
would,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
may
well
be.
the
problem
is,
your
honor,
in
(a)(2)
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
damages.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
agree
with
your
honor.
i
do
hesitate
to
say
something
that
generic.
the
problem
is,
the
court
has
said
that
it's
not...
there
isn't
some
specific
formula
for
stating
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
against
the
federal
government,
and
if
all
the
circumstances
were
that
that's
what
congress
intended,
but
i
would
think
there
would
have
to
be
some
indicia
of
intent,
that
they
meant
that
to
apply
to
the
federal
government.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
something
clearer
than
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
it's
because
of
the
court's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but
i
think
the
court
has
made
clear
that
for
the
federal
government,
normal
presumptions
that
you
might...
might
arise
from
words
like
use
of
legal
remedies,
in
lehman,
or
to
be
responsible
to
the
same
extent
for
reasonable
attorney's
fees
as
private
parties
in
shaw,
those
don't
mean
the
same
thing
against
the
federal
government
unless
congress
expressly
makes
that
clear.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
court
in
darrone
addressed
the
issue,
your
honor,
of
whether
under
504
an
employment
discrimination
suit
could
be
brought
against
recipients
of
federal
funds.
for
employment
discrimination
cases
against
the
federal
government
as
employer,
that
comes
under
section
501.
501
incorporates
all
of
title
vii's
remedies,
so
the
entitlement
to
back
pay
arises
out
of
the
entitlement
to
back
pay
under
title
vii.
and
i
should
also
point
out
that
when
congress
amended
title
vii
and
501
to
provide
for
compensatory
damages
with
the
restrictions
i
keep
trying
to
get
back
to,
the
court...
i
mean,
congress
also
specified...
and
this
is
on
page
7a.
this
is
under
the
1991
civil
rights
act.
there's
a
provision
where
it
explains
that
although
they're
waiving
sovereign
immunity
for
compensatory
damages
for
title
vii
and
501
and
ada,
compensatory
damages
awarded
under
this
section
shall
not
include
back
pay,
interest
on
back
pay,
or
any
other
type
of
relief
authorized
under
section
706(g)
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
'64.
that's
where
we
believe
the
entitlement--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
this
isn't
an
employment
situation.
no.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
matters
of
the
federal
fisc
are
something
that
congress
addresses,
and
congress
apparently
felt
very--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--apparently
not,
your
honor.
i
think
one--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--under
title
vii.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
1972,
according
to
the
chief
justice.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
it
was
a
couple
of
years
after
that,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
right.
i
would
also
point
out
that
i
think
congress
repeatedly
has
now
felt
comfortable
to
waive
immunity
against
money
damages
for
employment
contexts.
those
are
situations
in
which
it's
familiar
with
what
damages
are
available.
those
are
known.
whereas
discrimination
problems
that
arise
in
activities,
or
programs
conducted
by
federal
agencies,
could
raise
a
whole
host
of
questions
that
congress
may
not
have
wanted
to
bite
that
much
off
at
that
time.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
don't--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
don't
think
they
necessarily
thought
about
it.
one
point,
though,
that
i'd
like
to
emphasize,
your
honor,
is,
by
including
federal
executive
agencies
activities
and
programs
under
section
504,
congress
went
further
than
it
did
in
title--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
guess
what...
i'm
trying
to
address
that,
your
honor,
by
pointing
out
that
one
thing
congress
did
under
section
504
was
for
the
first
time,
to
my
knowledge,
bring
programs
and
activities
conducted
by
federal
agencies
under
this
type
of
prohibition.
they're
not
covered
by
title
vi
and
title
ix.
that
may
appear
irrational
also.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
may
have
wanted
to
be
more
protective
of
the
discrimination
against
the
people
with
disabilities
because
of
a
lower
constitutional
standard
that
would
be
applied
to
them,
so
congress
decided
to
take
that
step
and
be
more
protective
for
that
class
but
did
not
take
the
additional
one
of
opening
up
a
whole
class
of
unknown
damages
in
all
federal
programs.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
right.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i'm
sorry.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
706(g)
is
where
it
comes
from.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
(g),
and
that's
on
page...
if
you
look
at
7a,
on
page
7a
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
it's
the
last...
the
very
bottom
of
the
page.
that
is
section
1981a(b)(2).
it's
from
the
1991
civil
rights
act,
and
that
explains
why
the
new
waiver
in
1991
in
employment
cases
for
compensatory
damages
doesn't,
in
fact,
include
back
pay,
because
back
pay
is
already
there.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
okay.
i
just
wanted
to
go
back
for
one
more
point
to
emphasize
the
restrictions
that
congress
placed
on
the
waiver
for
employment
discrimination
cases.
in
the
1991
amendments,
congress
made
clear
that
it
was
only
for
intentional
cases
in
employment,
or
for
failure
to
reasonably
accommodate.
there,
federal
sovereign
immunity
is
not
waived
for
punitive
damages,
and
there
are
also
actual
statutory
caps
set
on
the
amount
that
can
be
recovered
under
that
waiver,
depending
on
the
number
of
employees
that
an
employer--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
the
plain
interpretation
of
that
sentence
would
be
that
in...
are
available
such
a
violation
in
a
suit
against
such
a
public
or
private
entity.
i
think
you
are...
in
your
action
against
the
state
you
say,
what
remedies
do
i
get,
and
you
get
to
go
look
at
any
suit
against
any
public
or
private
entity,
and
whatever
they
get
in
that
case,
you
get,
so
i
think
it
would
still
be
the
more
expansive
definition
even
without
any
congressional
intent.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
that
would
be
further
support
for
our
interpretation.
i'd
also
point
out,
regardless
of
that,
your
honor,
this
is
clearly
not
the...
not,
kind
of,
the
language
that
waives
the
federal
government
sovereign
immunity
against
damages.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
would
have
been
a
provision--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--frankly,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
need
to.
i
mean,
we
would
if
we
had
to.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i'd
think
so.
another
thing
i
think
that
the
court
should
focus
on
about
the
development
of
law
that
was
the
backdrop
behind
these
statutes,
the
remedies
for
damages
was
not
clear
until
the
franklin
court,
the
franklin
opinion
from
this
court
in
1992,
so
even
at
the
time
that
this
1986
amendment
was
passed,
it
was
not
at
all
clear
that
there
were
damages
necessarily
available
against
all
defendants.
there
were
lower
courts
that
had
held
that,
but
those
cases
did
not
involve
federal
executive
agencies,
because
they're
not
covered
by
title
vi
and
title
ix,
so
those
cases
did
not
address
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
here
of
federal
sovereign
immunity,
and
that's
really
a
critical
distinction
between
the
statutes
that
often
is
not
addressed
in
opinions
by
courts
because
it
just
wasn't
at
issue.
in
fact,
i
think
that
that's
a
significant
factor.
when
you
look
through
the
history
of
the
different
times
that
when
these
other
provisions
were
enacted
you
can
see
the
development
of
the
law
did
not
extend
at
that
time
to
damages
against
entities
other...
in
some
lower
courts
have
been
involved
in,
but
it
did
not
extend
to
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
fact,
one
of
the
lower
court's
opinions,
miener,
that
the
petitioners
cite...
recognize
this
was
pre
atascadero...
that
although
there
would
be
implied
cause
of
action
for
damages
against
private
entities,
it
could
not
operate
against
the
state
because
there
hadn't
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
allows
acts...
remedies
that
are
available
under
title
vi,
and
this
court
has
never
directly
addressed
whether
a
federal
provider
is
subject
to
a
direct
suit
under
that
provision.
it's
certainly
subject
to
suit
under
the
apa,
and
it's
also
subject
to
all
the
remedies
and
procedures
set
forth
in
title
vi.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
recipient,
if
it's
told
that
the
federal
provider
believes
that
the
recipient
is
discriminating
and
funds
are
going
to
be
cut
off,
there's
all
this
procedural
due
process,
and
that
recipient
would
be
a
person
aggrieved
by
an
act
of
the
federal
provider
and
could
invoke
that
provision.
and
congress
was
really
trying
to
say,
we're
going
to
treat
section
504
for
the
federal
fund
recipients
the
same
way
we
do
title
vi
and
title
ix,
but
it
did
not,
although
they
tried
to
adapt
that
provision
to
federal
executive
agency
programs
which
were
never
covered
under
title
vi,
or
title
ix,
for
that
matter.
if
there's
nothing
further,
your
honor--
