mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
intended
that
federal
agencies
who
discriminate
against
disabled
people
in
violation
of
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
are
to
be
subject
to
damages
for
those
violations.
it's
undisputed
in
this
case
that
in
fact
the
government
did
violate
section
504.
it's
also
undisputed
that
petitioner
griff
lane
was
caused
significant
damages
by
that
violation.
in
fact,
the
paper
before
the
court
contained
the
parties'
stipulation
that
his
damages
were
some
$75,000--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
name
i've
always
called
him.
sorry.
the
$75,000
to
mr.
lane
include
his
out
of
pocket
expenses
and
his
lost
earnings
for
the
2
years
he
was
improperly
excluded
from
the
merchant
marine
academy.
now,
we
understand
that
in
deciding
whether
or
not
mr.
lane
is
going
to
be
entitled
to
these
damages,
we
will
have
to
meet
the
strict
burden
that
this
court's
sovereign
immunity
cases
have
placed
on
us.
we
must
show
that
in
fact
it
was
clear
in
the
statute
that
congress
intended
these
damages
to
be
made
available.
we
believe
it
is
clear
in
the
statute.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
is,
and
we
believe--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
as
we
argued
in
our
reply
brief,
we
believe
even
if
you
read
505(a)(2)
alone,
in
isolation,
because
the
department
of
transportation
is
a
federal
provider--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--it
did
not,
your
honor,
and
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
we
believe
that
congress
when
it
amended
504
and
also
provided
in
505(a)(2)
for
this--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--yes--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct
also,
your
honor.
i'm
looking,
justice
scalia,
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief,
where
all
of
these
provisions
are
set
out,
and
i
will
use
the
u.s.c.
cite
for
clarity.
we
believe,
justice
o'connor,
that
because
the
department
of
transportation
is
a
federal
provider
in
the
sense
that
the
government
is
using
it
in
its
brief,
that
is--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--there
is
not
a
definition
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor,
of
federal
provider
anywhere
in
the
statute.
if
you
were
to
treat
federal
provider
there
as
simply
an
agency
that
extends
funds
to
a
non
federal
recipient,
then
the
department
of
transportation
is
clearly
a
federal
provider,
as
the
regulations
we've
cited
in
our
brief
show.
it
provides
funds,
in
that
sense,
for
highways,
railroads,
airports.
indeed,
every
departmental
agency
in
the
federal
government
is
a
federal
provider
in
that
sense.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not,
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
paralyzed
veterans,
which
indicates
that
funds
that
are
actually
provided
to
an
entity
that
the
federal
government
manages
itself,
which
is
what
dot
does
here,
effectively,
for
the
merchant
marine
academy,
then
the
merchant
marine
academy
is
not
a
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance,
but
dot
would
remain
a
federal
provider
for
purposes
of
the
question
justice
o'connor
was
asking,
but
our
view
is
that
you
shouldn't
read
federal
provider
in
that
narrow
sense
here.
we
believe
that
what
congress
intended
at
the
time
it
adopted
794a(a)(2)
was
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
new
duty
it
had
just
imposed
on
the
federal
government
in
what
is
now
504(a)
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
in
504(a)
in
1978,
congress
extended
the
application
of
504
to
federal
agencies,
or
in
this
case
executive
agencies,
and
at
the
same
time
it
amended
505(a)(2),
as
justice
o'connor
said,
to
provide
remedies.
we
think
the
explanation
of
the
difference
in
wording
that
the
ninth
circuit
provided
in
doe
is
correct.
the
amendment
to
504
came
from
the
house.
the
amendment
to
505(a)(2)
came
from
the
senate,
and
the
conference
report
didn't
make
the
two
exactly
coterminous.
but
to
read
this
as
intending
a
difference
in
treatment
between
the
two
would
mean
that
congress
imposed
a
new
duty
on
the
federal
government
but
then
in
the
remedy
section
provided
no
remedy,
and
at
the
same
time,
that
federal
provider
means
something
different--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
certainly,
your
honor,
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
there's
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
the
statute,
or
in
the
legislative
history,
that
congress
was
assuming
that
the
apa
was
going
to
apply
to
the
situation
precisely
for
the
reason
that
we're
here
now.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
right,
your
honor,
that
wouldn't
change
the
contention
that
i'm
trying
to
make
here.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
sorry.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
does
it
not
provide,
and
our
contention
is
what
congress
is
trying
to
do
here
was
to
equalize
the
remedies
available
for
all
entities
covered
by
section
504,
including
the
federal
government,
and
that
is
what
it
was
doing
in
505(a)(2),
or
29
u.s.c.
794a(a)(2).
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
our
contention
is
that
they
mean
the
same
thing,
but
our
contention
also
is
that
if
they
don't
mean
the
same
thing,
that
federal
provider
is
something
narrower,
that
we
are
still
entitled
to
damages
in
this
case.
i
mean,
it's
quite
clear,
and
we
understand
the
government's
position
to
agree
with
us
here,
that
whatever
federal
provider
may
mean,
there
is
a
damage
remedy
available
against
it,
which
means
that
something
more
than
what
the
apa
provides
is
provided
for
in
505(a)(2).
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
the
federal
provider
in
our
case
is...
within
the
meaning
we've
now
been
discussing
it,
your
honor,
is
the
department
of
transportation.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
our
view
is
that
because
505(a)(2)
subjects...
let
me
just...
the
language
is,
the
remedies
in
title
vi
shall
be
available
to
any
person
aggrieved
by
any
act
or
failure
to
act
by
a
federal
provider
in
violation
of
section
5...
in
violation
of
794.
dot
is
a
federal
provider.
it
has
committed
an
act
in
violation
of
section
504,
794--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
oh,
sorry.
it
discriminated
in
violation
of
section
504
against--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
we,
of
course,
brought
our
action
against
all
three
levels
here,
and
because
the
department
of
transportation
effectively
manages
the
merchant
marine
academy
through
marad,
which
is
another
intervening
entity,
dot
is
ultimately
responsible
in
our
view,
which
is
why
we
brought
the
action
against
the
secretary,
for
the
conduct
here.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
presumably
so,
your
honor.
we
actually
submitted
our
papers,
when
we
appealed
the
decision
of
the
academy,
both
to
marad
and
to
the
office
of
the
secretary,
and
the
resulting
decision
came
from
marad
upholding
his
exclusion.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
that's
why
our
first
argument
is
that,
in
fact,
congress
intended
a
damage
remedy
to
be
available
against
the
discriminator
itself.
when
it's
a
federal
agency,
a
damage
remedy
is
available.
when
it's
a
recipient--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
we
get
it
in
part
from
505(a)(2),
your
honor.
we
also
get
it
from
the
equalization
act
of
1986,
where
congress
did
two
things.
it
abrogated
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states,
and
more
important
for
our
purposes,
congress
made
clear
that
it
wanted
the
remedies
available
for
section
504
to
be
the
same
for
all
defendants
under
section
504.
that
is,
the
remedies
available
against
states
were
to
be
the
same
as
the
remedies
available
against
all
other
entities,
or
to
use
the
language
of
section
2
of
42
u.s.c.
2000d-7,
the
remedies
shall
be
the
same
for
a
violation
in
the
suit,
which
is
referring
to
a
suit
under
section
504,
against
any
public
or
private
entity
other
than
a
state.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
it--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--it
isn't
clear
in
that
case,
your
honor,
what
the
duty
then
is
in
504(a),
794a,
that
the
federal
provider
as
you're
now
defining
it
was
violating.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
if
that--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--in
that
event,
your
honor,
congress
has
imposed
a
duty
on
executive
agencies
not
to
discriminate.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
but
it's
not
provided
the
same
damage
remedy
for
that
kind
of
discrimination--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--as
the
kind
you
just
now
described.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
even
if
that
reading
is
a
plausible
one,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
is
not
because
of
the
anomaly
of
there
being
two
kinds
of
obvious
discrimination
and
for
one
you're
suggesting
a
remedy,
a
damage
remedy
is
provided
and
for
the
other
not,
i
would
still
contend
to
you
that
any
doubt
about
congress'
intention
on
the
point
you've
just
raised
is
resolved
again
by
the
equalization
of
remedies
act.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
that
that
was
the
impetus
for
the
1986
act,
but
section
2
of
that
act
as
we
read
it,
and
we
don't
understand
the
government
to
deny
this,
section
2
of
that
act,
by
its
own
terms,
equalizes
the
remedies
between
the
states,
which
we
know
includes
damages,
with
all
other
defendants
who
are
subject
to
a
suit
for
a
violation
under
all
of
the
statutes
named
in
section
1.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
not
a
negative
inference,
your
honor.
i
would
say
it's
a
positive
one,
because
the
language
of
section
2
speaks
of
a
suit
against
a
state
for
a
violation
of
a
statute
referred
to
in
section
1,
which
includes
section
504
that
we've
been
talking
about,
and
it
equalizes
the
remedy
between
a
state
on
the
one
hand
and
all
other
entities
covered
by
section
504
on
the
other.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
if...
i
would
say
that
any
public
entity
here
includes
the
federal
government.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
if
that--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
the
reason
i
think
it
has
to
refer
to
the
united
states
is
because
the
united
states
is
certainly
an
entity
that
is
covered
by
section
504,
which
is
listed
in
paragraph
(1).
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
let
me
try
to
respond,
your
honor.
the
states
are
unquestionably
subject
to
a
damage
remedy
under
the
language
of
this
provision
under
this
court's
decision
in
franklin.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
and
i
would
urge
that,
since
the
states
are
subject
to
a
damage
remedy,
and
since
the
purpose
of
this
provision
was
to
equalize
that
remedy
with
the
remedies
available
against
any
public
or
private
entity
other
than
a
state
that
is
subject
to
suit
under
section
504,
necessarily
public
entity
in
that
phrase
has
to
include
the
federal
government.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
if
i
follow
you,
your
honor,
that
would
mean
that
we
would
have
differing
remedies,
as
justice
kennedy
was
suggesting,
that
the
public
and
private
entity
may
be
subject
to,
but
if
that
were
the
case,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
we
are
to
choose
between
them
with
regard
to
what
remedies
the
state
is
going
to
be
subject
to.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
the
purpose
of
this
provision
was
to
respond
to
atascadero.
atascadero
was
premised
in
part
on
the
fact
that
nowhere
in
section
504
were
states
named
at
all
as
being
subject
to
the
act.
in
the
1978
amendment--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
they
might
have,
your
honor,
and
of
course,
i
wish
they
had,
or
i
wouldn't
be
here
now.
but
from
our
position
congress
didn't
do
that
in
the
'86
equalization
remedies
because
it
thought
it
didn't
need
to.
it
had
already
subjected
federal
agencies
to
suit
in
the
1978
amendments,
and
the
language
of
504
that
did
that,
it
has
been
well
established
by
cannon
and
other
cases,
did
in
fact
create
a
private
cause
of
action
against
every
entity
that's
named
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
so
sovereign
immunity
had
already
been
waived
for
the
federal
government
at
the
time
of
the
1986
equalization
act.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
thinking.
i'm
thinking.
i'm
thinking
before
i
answer,
your
honor.
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
because
congress
wanted
to
treat
all
of
them
equally,
and
any
public
or
private
entity,
as
that
phrase
is
used
there,
refers
to
all
of
the
covered
entities
under
section
504,
which
includes
the
federal
government.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
we
think
it's
helped,
your
honor,
because
of
the
overall
implausibility
of
the
proposition
that
congress
would
have
provided
everything
that
it
did
here,
which
is
to
say
it
provided
that
the
federal
government
would
be
subject
to
the
action,
that
attorney's
fees
would
be
available,
that
injunctive
relief
would
be
available--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--that
back
pay
would
be
available,
but
not
damages.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
the
court
dealt
with
that
in
the
franklin
case,
that
very
distinction
that
was
being
drawn,
and
said
the
effect
of
the
ruling
there
was
to
make
the
states
liable
to
pay
money
damages,
even
when
it
was
called
equitable
relief
in
the
form
of
back
pay.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
construe
all
of
these
provisions
together
and
decide
whether
or
not
the
reading
the
government
is
offering
is
a
plausible
one,
and
whether
the
structure
as
a
whole
that
the
government
is
asking
you
to
adopt
is
a
logical
one,
because
if
it
is
not,
the
court
should
not
attribute
an
illogical,
nonplausible
intent
to
the
congress.
and
the
reading
that
the
government
is
offering
you
here
is
that
congress
intended
that
all
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance
be
subject
to
damages,
that
states
be
subject
to
damages...
congress
expressly
abrogated
the
states'
sovereign
immunity
for
that
purpose...
that
the
federal
government
be
liable
for
damages
when
it
comes
to
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
disability,
that
the
federal
government
be
liable
in
some
way
when
it's
a
federal
provider,
although
the
government
wants
to
narrowly
contain
that,
and
it
has
no
explanation
for
why
damages
wouldn't
be
available
under
the
plain
meaning
of
a(a)(2)
in
that
circumstance.
but
yet,
it
urges
the
court
to
conclude
that
in
this
one
area,
direct
discrimination
by
executive
agencies,
that
congress
set
out
to
withhold
one
kind
of
relief
only,
money
damages.
it
provided
for
injunctive
relief,
it
provided
for
back
pay,
it
provided
for
attorney's
fees,
but
the
congress
set
out
to
withhold
one
kind
of
relief,
money
damages.
i
submit
to
you
that's
an
implausible
reading
of
this
statute.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
choose,
your
honor,
because
i
think
we
serve
both.
i
think
this
court's
cases
make
clear
that,
while
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
has
to
be
clear,
the
court
will
not
deny
damage
relief
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
reading
is
an
implausible
one.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
i
think
that...
i
think
the
501
provision
actually
supports
us,
your
honor.
that
was
an
entirely
different
section
that
was
not
construed
to
provide
a
private
cause
of
action
until
1978,
unlike
504,
and
in
1978
congress
set
out
two
different
kinds
of
remedies,
title
vii
for
the
501
section,
and
title
vi
for
the
504
section.
damages
are
available
under
title
vi.
they
are
not
available
under
title
vii,
and
as
a
consequence,
congress
has
to
amend
the
statute
in
1991,
to
make
damages
available
for
the
first
time
and
thereby
equalize
the
remedies
against
the
federal
government
when
it
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
disability,
so
i
think
the
501
circumstance
helps
our
view
that
congress
surely
did
not
intend
to
carve
out
this
one
area
and
withhold
relief.
let
me
speak
to
the
public
entity
point
for
just
a
moment.
i
understand
the
government's
argument
to
be
that
the
federal
government
is
not
a
public
entity
within
the
meaning
of
2000d-7(2)
because
the
only
statutes
being--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--thank
you.
