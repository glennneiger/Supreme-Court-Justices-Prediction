justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
just
pursue
justice
stevens'
point.
have
you
been
able
to
think
of
any
reason
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
say,
we
will
pay
all
private
people
pay
money
damages.
states,
i
guess,
by
and
large,
do.
we'll
pay
money
damages,
too,
for
any
one
of
the
490...
$1
trillion
worth
of
government
programs,
but
we
won't
pay
money
damages
in
whatever's
left
over
in
the
federal
government,
which
probably
isn't
much.
i
mean,
what
was
the
theory
of
such
a
thing?
is
there
a
word
that
suggests
either
there's
a
theory
to
that,
or
is
there
a
word
that
suggests
that
anybody
in
congress
even
thought
about
it
for
more
than
a
second
or
two?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
whether
what
they
did
was
good
or
bad.
i'm
simply
saving,
if
you
have
a
distinction
in
terms
of
sovereign
immunity
that
seems
totally
irrational,
that
we
can't
even
think
of
a
reason
for--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
also
have
language
that
permits
the
award,
why
isn't
that
good
enough?
