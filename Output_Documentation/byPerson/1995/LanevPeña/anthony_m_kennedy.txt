could
the
secretary
have
ordered
the
admission,
or
the
continued

of

the

could
have
reversed
the

but
your
reading
makes
public
and
private
superfluous.
it
didn't
say,
any
other
entity
whatsoever.
it
says,
any
public
or
private
entity,
thereby
indicating
to
me
that
there
may
be
a
distinction
between
the
remedies
available
against
a
private
entity
on
the
one
hand,
and
a
public
entity
on
the
other.

so
the
state
equalization
clause
wants
to
pick
both
of
them
up,
and
that's
why
it
has
public
and
private
in
it,
knowing
that
there
may
be
a
difference.

--if
i
could
ask
you
one
more
thing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
your
case
helped
at
all
by
the
fact
that
it's
recognized...
i
think
it's
recognized
that
back
pay
is
permissible
in
a
suit
against
the
government?
does
that
help
your
case,
or
do
we
think
of
back
pay
as
being
an
equitable
remedy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
the
government
right
in
saying,
or
at
least
in
implying
that
back
pay
is
simply
an
equitable
remedy?
