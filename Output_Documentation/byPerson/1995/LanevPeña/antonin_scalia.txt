justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
me
a
hand
here
and
use
the
u.s.c.
sections?
i
mean,
maybe
you
work
with
the
enacted
bill
all
the
time,
but
i
don't.
are
you
talking
about
section
794a?
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it--
--it
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
would
mean
that
there's
always
a
suit
under
the
apa
to
get
the
government
to
comply
with
obligations
imposed
upon
the
government
by
law.
if
the
government
is
acting,
you
have
a
suit
to
review
the
lawfulness
of
that
government
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
then
the
only
question
is,
is
there
in
addition
provided
by
this
statute
a
suit
for
money
damages,
which
the
apa
does
not
provide?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
can
i
suggest
a
different
reading
of
794a(a)(2),
and
you
tell
me
why
it
would
not
make
sense.
it
seems
to
me
the
phrase,
recipient
of
federal
assistance,
bears
a
fairly
common
meaning.
there
are
federal
assistance
programs
in
which
federal
money
is
given
to
organizations
which
in
turn
act
to
help
those
in
need,
and
if
such
a
person
providing
help
to
those
in
need
discriminates
in
violation
of
the
act,
you
would
have
a
suit
under
a(a)(2).
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
or
federal
provider
of
such
assistance.
that
would
mean
that
if
the
federal
agency
which
provides
money
to
the
private
agency
which
makes
the
direct
assistance
discriminates
in
its
provision
of
funds
by
denying
funds
for
handicapped
facilities,
for
example,
you
would
have
a
claim
against...
for
damages
against
that
federal
agency.
if
you
interpreted
it
that
way,
it
would
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
money
damages
only
with
respect
to
the
money
that
the
assistance
program
would
have
provided.
that's
what
the
money
damages
would
be.
it
would
make
perfect
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
the
way
to
read
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
provider
cannot
deny
funds
to
an
otherwise
eligible
private
provider
of
assistance
to
the
public
on
the
ground
that
those
funds
are
going
to
be
spent
on
handicapped
facilities.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
denied
that,
you
know,
this
is
an
extravagant
expenditure,
building
this
ramp
for
wheelchairs
or
what
not
is
an
extravagant
expenditure,
and
we
will
not
provide
funds
for
that,
you
would
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
federal
provider
to
get
those
funds.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
because
it
knew
that,
you
know,
damages
can
get
out
of
hand,
especially
against
a
deep
pocket
like
the
government,
and
the
only
kind
of
damage
actions
we're
going
to
allow
are
damage
actions
for
the
amount
of
money
that
would
have
been
provided
under
the
assistance
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
public
doesn't
refer
to
the
united
states.
how
do
you
know
it
refers
to
the
united
states?
it
could
refer
to
municipalities.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
is
that
this
language
reflects
the
understanding
by
congress
that
all
public
and
private
entities
were
liable
for
money
damages.
i
think
that's
what
your
argument
is.
not
that
it
created
liability
for
money
damages,
but
that
that
language
there,
suit
against
any...
in
a
suit
against
any
public
or
private
entity
other
than
a
state,
it
displays
an
acknowledgement
by
the
congress
that
passed
that
that
all
public
and
private
entities
were
similarly
suable.
it's
not
a
trick
question.
this
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brinkmann,
i
still
don't
understand
why
you
exclude
damage
remedies
against
the
federal
provider.
it's
because
you
say
no
damages
are
obtainable
against
a
federal
provider
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
it's
not
saying...
794a(a)(2)
in
your
view
does
not
say
that
money
damages
are
available.
it
says
that
money
damages
are
available
here
where
they
are
available
under
title
vi,
which
is
not
always--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
your
view.
but
even
if
we
took--
--perhaps
they
wouldn't
include
pain
and
suffering,
or
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
cover
back
pay?
the
apa
wouldn't
cover
back
pay,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not
include
back
pay,
so
you
still
have
to
explain
where
you
get
a
cause
of
action
against
the
government
for
back
pay,
and
it's...
it
doesn't
satisfy
me
to
say
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
in
this
case,
because
i
for
one
think
that
where
there
has
been
a
general
grant
of
suit
against
the
united
states,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
further
insist
that
there
be
a
specific
grant
of
suit
for
money
damages.
i
think
if
there's
a
general
grant
of
suit
against
the
united
states,
i
would
normally
think
it's
suit
for
all
purposes
that
suit
lies.
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me,
794a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--(b)...
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
but,
here's
the
problem,
ms.
brinkmann.
if
we
adopt
the
petitioner's
view,
we
will
have
solved
the
problem
that
we
took
this
case
for
and
would
not
have
created
another
problem.
if
we
take
your
view,
we're
going
to
have
to
have
another
lawsuit
as
to
the
meaning
of
2000d-7(2),
because
as
he
interprets
the
law,
all
public
and
private
entities
can
get
money
damages.
all
public
and
private...
suits
against
all
public
and
private
entities
will
give
money
damages--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it's
easy
to
apply
(a)(2).
now,
if
we
take
your
view,
there's
at
least
some
public
entity
that
you
can't
get
money
damages
against,
and
what
do
you
do
then
under
2000d-7(a)(2)?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
says
to
the
same
extent
as
such
remedies
are
available
for
such
a
violation
in
the
suit
against
any
public
or
private--
justice
antonin
scalia
--entity,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
which
one
of
the
two
do
you
pick?
do
you
pick
the
one
that
gives
you
the
lesser
damages,
or
the
one
that
gives
you
more?
it
is
disjunctive,
but
you
still
have
to
decide
which
one
of
the
two
disjunctive
ones
you
select.
do
you
select
the
lesser
or
the
greater?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we'll
have
a
lawsuit
about
that,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
said,
all
entities?
all
entities.
would
that
suffice?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
there
are
so
many
entities
in
the
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
says
all
public
entities,
it
does
suffice.
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
public
entities
in
the
world,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brinkmann,
i
hate
to
bring
you
back
to
back
pay,
but
i
didn't
understand
your
explanation.
as
i
recall,
when
you
got
done,
it
boiled
down
to
section
706
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
'64,
that
that's
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
794a(a)(1),
what
you're
referring
to
as
504,
and
i
wish
you'd
refer
to
the
code
sections--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
i...
does
not
incorporate
section
706.
it
incorporates
section
717,
including
the
applications
of
7...
is
it
706--
justice
antonin
scalia
--(f)
through
(k)?
justice
antonin
scalia
706--
justice
antonin
scalia
--gotcha.
okay.
that
would
explain
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brinkmann,
would
you
explain
once
more
what
the
government
is
willing
to
concede
794a(a)(2)
does
allow
by
way
of
monetary
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
a
federal
provider?
do
you
mean
a
grant
making
agency?
