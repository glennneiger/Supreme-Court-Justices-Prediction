mr.
smith,
may
i
refer
you
to
the
statute,
section
505(a)(2),
dealing
explicitly
with
remedies?
there
is
a
section,
is
there
not,
of
the
statute
that
deals
with
remedies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
says
the
remedies
set
forth
in
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
shall
be
available
to
any
person
aggrieved
under
the
statute,
and
the
civil
title
vi
in
includes
compensatory
damages,
i
believe,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
it
goes
on
and
it
says,
any
person
aggrieved
by
any
act
or
failure
to
act
by
any
recipient
of
federal
assistance,
or
federal
provider
of
such
assistance.
now,
who
is
a
federal
provider?
is
the
department
of
transportation
a
federal
provider
of
assistance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it
is,
then
does
the
statute
cover
it
and
you
don't
have
to
go
through
all
this
implication?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
we
know
who's
a
federal
provider?
it's...
under
the
operative
section
that
was
amended
to
include
any
program
or
activity
conducted
by
any
executive
agency,
it
didn't
refer
to
it
as
a
federal
provider,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
794a(a)(2)
would
be
the
remedy
section,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
general
liability
section
would
be
794(a),
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
definition
anywhere?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
thought
the
academy
discriminated.
i
thought
the
academy
did
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
section
that
appears
to
make
a
federal
provider
liable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
agree
that
congress
did
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
purposes
of
money
damages
insofar
as
the
money
is...
the
assistance
is
provided
by
a
federal
provider?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
does
say
the
remedies
set
forth
in
title
vi
are
available
against
a
federal
provider,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
would
congress
want
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
if
the
federal
government
is
a
federal
provider
of
assistance
but
not
if
it
does
it
directly,
as
an
executive
agency?
that
is
kind
of
odd,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
department
of
transportation
a
federal
provider
of
assistance?
