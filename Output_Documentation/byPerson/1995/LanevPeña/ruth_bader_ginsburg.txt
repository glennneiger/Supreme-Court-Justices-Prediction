mr.
smith,
why
is
that
so
extraordinary?
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
under
702
with
its
broad
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
nonmonetary
relief,
the
idea
of
sovereign
immunity
being
waived
as
to
relief
other
than
monetary
is
hardly
novel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
talking
about
the
apa
applying,
but
is
it...
am
i
not
right
that
702,
in
its
broad
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
is
hardly
limited
to
cases
arising
under
the
apa.
i
thought
that...
at
least,
there
are
several
decisions
that
are
held
that
that's
an
all
purpose
waiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
the
distinction
that
you're
making,
the...
you
say
that
502(a)(2),
provider,
covers
the
department
of
transportation
because
it
provides,
but
in
this
particular
case
it's
in
its
capacity
as
executive
agency,
not
as
provider.
under
that
reading,
it
would
mean
that
a
government
agency
that
doesn't
provide
funds,
that
just
has
its
own
operation,
would
not
be
responsible
for
money
damages,
and
that's
an
illogical
way,
i
think,
for
congress
to
act.
either
they
want
the
government
agency
as
government
agency
with
respect
to
people
under
its
programs
to
be
covered
or
it
doesn't,
but
a
line
between
an
agency
that
gives
money
and
an
agency
that
doesn't,
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
don't
get
that
from
the
word,
federal
provider,
in
505(a)(2),
where
do
you
get
that
explicit
waiver
of
damages,
or
clear
waiver?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
it
just
saying,
you're
entitled
to
the
best
remedy
there
is,
it's
private
entity
just
as
though
public
wasn't
there.
it's
public
or,
so
if
there
would
be
this
remedy
against
a
private
entity,
it
would
be
against
the
state.
but
your
interpretation
seems
to
me
strange
for
this
reason,
mr.
smith.
here
is
a
clear,
explicit
waiver
by
the
federal
government
of
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
if
it
had
waiver
of
federal
sovereign
immunity
in
mind,
the
most
logical
thing
to
do
would
not
be
to
put
it
in
this
reverse
way
that
you
suggest,
but
to
say,
and
there
shall
be
no
federal
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
it
be
logical,
though,
even
if
the
trigger
is
a
case
that's
dealing
with
state
immunities,
for
a
congress
filled
with
lawyers
to
think,
well,
we
know
the
feds
are
also
immune,
while
we're
dealing
with
governmental
immunity
we
should
take
care
of
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
the
source
of
your
concession?
i
think
you
are
not
disputing
that
there
is
relief,
and
it's
injunctive,
back
pay,
and
attorney's
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
the
waiver
of
the
sovereign's
immunity
as
to
those
come
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
nonmonetary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
the
waiver
that's
contained
in
702.
it
says...
the
word
is
nonmonetary.
nonmonetary.
justice
ruth

that
was
a
discrete
item.
that
was
interest--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--which
traditionally
had
been
treated
as
separate,
requiring
a
separate
immunity
waiver.
but
while
you're
dealing
with
back
pay,
attorney's
fees
also
is
monetary
relief
against
the
government,
so
the
source
of
those
two,
which
you
concede--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
the--
--ms.
brinkmann,
if
you
can
go
back
to
the
back
pay,
because
i
don't
think
i
got
it
fully.
why
is
the
government
responsible
for
back
pay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
that
there
was
a
back
pay
element
in
this
$75,000?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brinkmann,
when
did

was
it
before
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
when
did
the
federal
government
agencies
become--
justice
ruth

--so
it
s
not

unusual
to
impose
an
obligation
on

still
keep

justice
ruth
bader

what
about
ms.
brinkmann's
argument
that
when
congress
did
waive
immunity
in
501,
it
pregated
it.
it
was
not

that
we
waive
immunity,
