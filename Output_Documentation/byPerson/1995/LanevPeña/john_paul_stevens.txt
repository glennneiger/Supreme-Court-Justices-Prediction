ms.
brinkmann,
may
i
call
your
attention,
or
ask
you
a
question
about
the
1986
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
is
the
secretary
of
transportation
and/or
the
merchant
marine
academy
a
public
entity
other
than
a
state
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
it
matters,
so
let's
have
an
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
answer's
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
is
not
consistent
with
the
plain
meaning
of
any
public
entity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
you
have
to
look
at
legislative
history
and
you
figure
they
didn't
mean
to
include--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--federal
agencies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
quite
clear
that
congress
intended
there
to
be
a
damage
remedy
against
states
and,
therefore,
must
it
not
have
made
the
assumption
justice
scalia
described
a
little
earlier?
they
must
therefore
have
assumed,
if
public
entity
includes
the
merchant
marine
academy,
that
such
a
remedy
was
available
against
the
merchant
marine
academy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
1986
statute?
forgetting
the
plain
language
for
a
minute,
just
looking
at
broadly
the
provision,
it's
your
view
that
congress
deliberately
wanted
to
overcome
a
constitutional
objection
to
suits
against
states
and
impose
the
states
to
damage
liability,
but
yet
retain
its
own
sovereign
immunity.
that's
what
you
think
congress
was
realistically
trying
to
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that's
probable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
concerned
about
state
fiscs?
