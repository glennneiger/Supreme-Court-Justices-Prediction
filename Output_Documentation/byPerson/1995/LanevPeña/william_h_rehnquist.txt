the
court
remains
in
session.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-365,
james
griffin
lane
v.
federico
pena.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see
the
petitioner's
name,
mr.
smith,
is
james
griffin
lane.
when
you
say
griff
lane,
is
that
how
you
refer
to
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
call
the
department
of
transportation
a
federal
provider
with
respect
to
the
merchant
marine
academy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
truly
remarkable,
then,
with
the
sections
coming
right
in
sequence,
that
different
language
is
used
in
505(a)(2),
794a(a)(2),
than
the
section
right
before
it.
you
say,
really,
they
mean
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
who's
the
federal
provider
in
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
would
not
be
the
federal
provider
with
respect
to
the
merchant
marine
academy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
that
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
mean,
you
say
it's
committed
an
act.
do
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
equalization
of
remedies
act
seems
to
me
to
be
devoted
primarily
to
making
the
states
liable
in
response
to
our
atascadero
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what
it's
saying,
section
2
is
saying
is
that
you're
going
to
have
the
remedies
available
against
a
state
that
are
available
against
other
entities,
and
you
draw
from
that
kind
of
a
negative
inference
that
since
damages
are
available
against
the
state,
therefore
they
must
be
available
against
these
other
public
entities,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
doesn't--
--you're
reading
the
converse
of
it.
you're
saying
that
all
the...
remedies
against
all
public
entities
is
the
same
as
that
available
against
the
states,
but
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
says
the
converse.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
smith.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--ms.
brinkmann,
supposing
congress
just
originally,
without
having
any...
passed
a
statute
saying
that
all
public
entities
shall
be
liable
for
damages
if
they
violate
the
handicapped
act.
now,
would
you
think
that
would
include
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
think
a
generic
term
like
all
public
entities
would
be
a
sufficient
waiver
for...
to
include
the
united
states?
i--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
i
would...
ordinarily
i
would
think
that
our
cases
would
not
support
what
you
say
in
your
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
simply
referring
to
where
you
could
be
talking
about
local
governments,
state
governments,
that
to
make
the
united
states
liable
it
requires
something
more
specific
than
public
entities.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
reason
for
the
exclusion
of
back
pay
in
the
'91
act
the
fact
that
it's
already
included?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
smith,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
