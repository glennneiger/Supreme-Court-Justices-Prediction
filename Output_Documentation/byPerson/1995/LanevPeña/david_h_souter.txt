h.

but
even
if
it
does,
i
don't
know
why
it
follows
from
your...
anything
further
follows
from
your
argument
than
if
the
federal
government
does
not
have
to
provide
a
general
damages
remedy,
then
by
virtue
of
this
particular
provision
the
state
wouldn't
have
to
provide
one.
i
mean,
it...
if...
you
seem
to
say,
because
a
state
has
to
provide
one
based
on
some
independent
ground,
that
the
feds
do,
too,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
on
your
reading
of
(2),
you
can't
go
any
further
than
saying,
if
this
were
the
basis
for
subjecting
the
states
to
damages,
then
the
states
would
not
be
subjected
to
a
general
damage
remedy
because
the
national
government
is
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
mm
hmm.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
assuming
that
it
does,
but
the...
what
you
refer
to
as
being
equalization,
as
i
understand
the
statute
means
that
the
states
cannot
provide
less
than
the
other
entities
to
whom
they
are
compared.
it
does
not
follow
from
that
that
if
the
state,
by
virtue
of
one
comparison,
has
to
provide
a
damage
remedy,
that
another
public
entity,
i.e.,
the
united
states,
must
do
the
same
thing.
it
just
doesn't
follow.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
brinkmann,
may
i
go
back
to
what
is
probably
a
simple
point
about
the
'86
act?
justice
scalia
asked
you
the
question,
referring
to
subsection
(2),
which
refers
to
remedies
against
any
public
or
private
entity,
and
he
said,
how
do
we
know
that
congress
didn't
mean
to
restrict
the
remedy
to
the
entity
that
gets...
that
is
least
liable,
as
opposed
to
expanding
the
remedy
by
reference
to
the
entity
that
is
most
liable?
is
it
your
answer,
we
know
it
preferred
the
expansive
interpretation
because
it
was
a
post
atascadero
case,
and
the
whole
point
of,
the
object
of
the
legislation
was
simply
to
expand
liability?
it
was...
your
answer,
in
effect,
is
a
congressional
intent
answer,
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
without
the
congressional
intent,
there
wouldn't
be
an
answer
in
the
text?
justice
david
h.
souter
logically
you
could
say,
well,
i'm
not
subject
to
that
remedy
because
somebody
else
is
not.
i
mean,
logically
you
could
do
either
one.
you've
got
to
go
on
intent,
i
suppose,
or
maybe
you've
got
to
go
perhaps
on
a
generalized
practice
that
you
don't
enact
statutes
like
this
in
order
to
limit
liability,
just
as
a
general
rule.
that
just
isn't
the
structure
that
you
would
employ
for
that
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
that
in
effect,
that,
just
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
point
on
that,
i
suppose
your
ultimate
answer
on
that
is,
it
may
be
as
illogical
as
the
devil,
but
the
fact
is,
if
you're
going
to
be
starchy
about
requiring
waivers
of
federal
sovereign
immunity,
illogicality
is
not
enough
to
do
it.
i
mean,
is
that...
does
the
government
fall
back
on
that
position,
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if
we
think
you
do,
is
that
the
government's
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it...
except
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
simply
poses
two
opposing
canons
of
interpretation.
one
is
to
find
the
most
systematic
way
of
construing
the
whole
statute.
another
is
to
preserve
the
government's
immunity
absent
the
satisfaction
of
a
very
high
standard
of
waiver,
and
i
think
what
your
argument
does
say,
says
to
us
is,
all
right,
which
are
you
going
to
prefer,
systematic
logic,
or
the
importance
of
sovereign
immunity?
