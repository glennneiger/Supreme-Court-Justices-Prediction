justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you,
of
course...
you
also
agree
that
the
word
use
is
not
superfluous,
that
there
are
uses
of
the
gun
when
it
is
not
being
carried.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
the...
what's
the
best
example
of
that,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
displaying
it
without
carrying
it,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
referring
to
it
in
the
trunk
of
a
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
quarrel
with
the
smith
holding
at
all,
as
i
understand
your
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
agree
that
the
trading
of
a
firearm
is
an
active
use
of
the
firearm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sticking
it
in
the
trunk
or
some
locked
compartment
where
it's
not
used
at
all
is
not
use
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
you
commented
on
justice
breyer's
opinion
on
the
first
circuit.
do
you
think
then-judge
kennedy's
opinion
in
the
early
case
on
the
ninth
circuit
supports
you
or
is
against
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
the
thing
that
gives
the
statute
its
breadth
is
its
coverage
of
passive
use...
i
mean,
passive
possession
with
ultimate
intent
to
sell...
and
i
suppose
under
your
theory
anyone
who
has
drugs
in
his
or
her
home
on
a
sort
of
permanent
basis,
intending
to
sell
some
from
time
to
time,
and
who
carries
a
gun
when
coming
home
at
night,
or
in
case
somebody
might
be
there
to
steal
the
drugs,
would
always
be
using
the
gun
in
connection
with
the
transaction,
which
would
seem
to
me
to
mean
that
if
a
person
was
in
california,
carrying
the
gun
as
he
always
carries
his
gun
with
him,
and
the
drugs
are
at
home
in
new
york
and
found
during
a
search
pursuant
to
a
warrant,
he
would
be
liable
under
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
be
carrying
during
the
commission--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
the
offense
back
in
new
york.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
--isn't
it
true...
let
me
just
check
about
one
other
thing
that
runs
through
my
mind.
i
gather
the
use
or
a
possession
must
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
way
this
statute
is
now
phrased.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
think...
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
it
wouldn't
have
to
be.
it
could
be...
you
could
change
the
language
of
the
statute
a
little
bit
and
make
this
an
enhancement
factor,
and
it
would
only
have
to
be
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
then
and
you'd
still
get
the
5-year
mandatory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
the
same
breadth
of
coverage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
