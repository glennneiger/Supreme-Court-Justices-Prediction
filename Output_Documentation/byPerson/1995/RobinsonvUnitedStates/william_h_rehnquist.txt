we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-7448,
roland
j.
bailey
v.
united
states,
consolidated
with
robinson
v.
united
states.
mr.
untereiner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
mr.
untereiner,
what
is
your
view
as
to
the
meaning
of
uses
and
the
meaning
of
carries
in
that
phrase?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
our
opinion
in
the...
wasn't
it
in
the
smith
case
where
we
said
if
you...
that
you
use
a
weapon
if
you
barter
it
for
some
drugs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
your
view,
use
is
broader
than
carry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
in
your...
the
hypothetical
about
the
weapon
being
visibly
displayed
it
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
be
on
one's
person.
perhaps
it
wouldn't
be
carried,
but
then
it
would
be
used.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then,
that
example,
use
would
be
broader
than
carry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
include--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
carry
doesn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
blow
someone's
head
off
from
behind.
the
person
never
sees
you,
but
surely
you've
used
a
weapon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
section
924(d)
in
the
papers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
we
prefer
one
to
the
other
in
making
a
decision
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
an
argument
of
statutory
construction.
i
thought
you
were
urging
something
more,
that
there's
one
sentencing
regime
would
prevail
if
your
client...
if
you
won,
another
if
the
government
won,
and
the
one
was
just
basically
a
better
sentencing
regime
than
the
other.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that's
our
decision
to
make.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
untereiner.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was...
in
robinson's
case,
were
the
drugs
that
were
part
of
the
transaction
taken
out
of
that
foot
locker?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
untereiner,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
untereiner.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94-7448,
bailey
against
united
states
and
the
companion
case
of
robinson
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
