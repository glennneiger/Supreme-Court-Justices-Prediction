mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
a
firearm
is
used
within
the
meaning
of
section
924(c)
when
the
defendant
puts
or
keeps
it
in
a
place
where
it
is
available
to
protect
himself
during
drug
trafficking
operations
and
to
embolden
him
to
commit
that
offense,
and
we
believe
that,
applying
that
definition,
the
evidence
was
sufficient
in
both
of
these
cases
to
support
petitioners'
convictions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
the
use
of
the
firearm
had
to
be
knowing
and
intentional,
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
sufficient
for
the
jury
to
draw
the
inference
that
roland
bailey
had
the
9
millimeter
smith
&
wesson
automatic
pistol
in
his
trunk
to
protect
his
possession
of
cocaine
and
the
proceeds
of
that
drug
trafficking,
and
that
candisha
robinson
had
a
derringer
in
a
locked
foot
locker
in
her
apartment
bedroom,
where
drugs
were
kept
and
from
which
drugs
were
dealt
both
on
the
day
of
the
drug
trafficking
crime
that
was
charged
in
the
indictment
and
on
the
previous
day.
so
the
jury
could
readily
draw
the
inference
that
the
defendant,
or
the
defendant's
agents
perhaps,
in
candisha
robinson's
case,
had
put
the
firearm
in
that
place
so
that
it
would
be
available
if
the
need
arose
during
the
drug
trafficking
crime
that
was
charged
in
section
924(c).
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
jury
could
draw
that
inference,
yes,
because
there
was
a
drug
transaction
within
about
a
half-an-hour
of
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant,
and
after
the
search
warrant
was
executed,
cocaine
was
found,
crack
cocaine
was
found
in
the
trunk
in
the
bedroom,
so
the
jury
could...
and
marked
money
from
that
transaction
was
also
found
in
that
trunk.
so
the
jury
could
readily
infer
that
candisha
robinson's
agent,
parker,
had
gone
to
the
trunk
and
had
retrieved
the
cocaine
from
that
place,
and
during
that
time
had
the
gun
available
to
him
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
him
if
the
need
arose.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
neither...
justice
scalia,
neither
of
the
violations
in
these
cases
involved
the
offense
of
distribution.
they
involved
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
so
the
crucial
issue
is
whether
the
gun
was
available
to
the
defendant
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
his
possession--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--of
the
drugs.
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
may
not
be
sufficient
for
the
jury
to
draw
the
inference.
under
the
standard
that
was
adopted
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
this
case,
two
facts
were
required
to
be
established
before
the
jury
could
draw
the
inference.
first,
the
drugs
and
the
gun
had
to
be
in
reasonable
proximity
to
each
other.
they
had
to
be
near
to
each
other,
so
that
there
should
be...
there
could
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
jury
to
conclude
that
the
gun
was
in
a
place
where
it
could
serve
the
protective
purpose,
and
second,
it
had
to
be
accessible
to
the
defendant
when
the
defendant
was
handling
the
drugs
or
the
drug
proceeds,
so
that
the
jury
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
defendant
did,
indeed,
knowingly
and
intentionally
put
or
keep
the
firearm
there
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
his
stash
of
drugs.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
not
necessarily.
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
the
possession
of
cocaine
with
the
intent
to
distribute
it
is
a
continuing
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
at
every
time
in
which
the
defendant--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--goes
to
the
trunk.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
possibly,
but
not
necessarily.
that
certainly
is
not
essential
to
our
theory
of
the
case,
and
nor
is
it
essential--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
the
connotation
of
use
that
we're
proposing
at
least
embraces
the
availability
of
the
firearm
for
protection--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that's
the
time
when
it's
clearest.
our
theory
of
what
the
use--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
justice
souter,
we
are,
and
because
the
use
of
the
gun
consists
of
two
different
purposes.
first,
it
gives
the
drug
dealer
the
security
and
the
confidence
to
know
that
he
can
protect
himself
when
he
is
actually
on
the
site,
accessing
the
drugs,
near
to
them,
protecting--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
evolution
of
the
statute
i
think
reflects
that
originally
the
word
use
was
put
in
the
statute
to
define
one
branch
of
liability
which
is
probably
narrower
than
the
liability
that's
currently
in
the
statute.
originally,
in
1968,
the
statute
was
written
to
prohibit
the
use
of
a
firearm
to
commit
any
felony
which
can
be
prosecuted
in
federal
court,
or
carrying
a
gun
unlawfully
during
a
felony,
and
those
were
two
very
separate
kinds
of
liability.
in
1984,
congress
decided
to
merge
those
two
forms
of
liability,
and
to
delete
the
very
specific
qualifications
that
gave
use
and
carry
different
connotations.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
does.
in
fact,
i
think
that
the
formulation
that
congress
chose,
use
or
carry
during
and
in
relation
to,
is
a
very,
very
broad
way
of
describing
the
nexus.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
is,
and
it
depends
on
what
the
crime
is,
and
if
the
crime
is
one
that
takes
place
only
in
a
very
brief
span
of
time,
such
as
assault
on
a
bank
teller
with
a
deadly
weapon,
then
indeed
you
have
to
find
that
the
use
is
during
that
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
if
the
requirement
is
added,
during
and
in
relation
to,
then
the
verb
possess
would
probably
pick
up
the
same
scope
of
liability
that
we
are
describing,
but
that's...
it
would
not
by
itself,
of
course.
merely
to
possess
a
firearm
is
not
prohibited
under
this
statute,
or
punished.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it...
i
mean,
use
i
think
requires
more
in
and
of
itself
than
merely
possession.
use
requires
at
least--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
pretty
much
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
we
think
that
by
using
the
verb
use,
congress
did
pick
a
very
broad
verb,
that
in
fact
probably
picks
up
more
than
possess
in
relation
to
the
offense.
it
also
picks
up
the
kinds
of
uses
that
people
think
of
as
the
paradigmatic
uses
of
firearms.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
do,
and
i
further
think
that
the
specific
felony
that
we
have
at
issue
here,
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
is
one
that
congress
singled
out
for
inclusion,
because
when
it
added
drug
trafficking
crime
to
the
statute
in
1986,
it
spoke
of
manufacturing,
distributing,
or
selling,
i
believe,
verbs
that
left
some
courts...
at
least
it
left
a
legal
issue
open
to
litigate
about
whether
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
was,
in
fact,
covered.
in
1988,
congress
amended
the
statute
for
the
specific
purpose
of
ensuring
that
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
was
covered,
and
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
any
more
that,
under
section
924(c),
that
congress
specifically
intended
that
there
be
uses
of
firearms
in
connection
with
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
offenses.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it
probably
would,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
not
leave
out
some
possibilities
of
different
situations.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
we
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
both
sides
in
this
case
are
grappling
with
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
two
offenses,
and
what
it
is.
in
the
reported
cases,
there
really
are
not
any
examples
that
i
can
see
where
we
could
not
have
charged
a
use
under
our
theory
even
if
the
defendant
was
carrying
it.
under
their
theory,
i
think
you
could
always
charge
every
offense
as
a
carry,
and
there
would
be
nothing
additional
that
use
would
pick
up,
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
one
example
that
i
think
proves
our
point.
they
concede
that
it
would
be
a
use
of
a
firearm
to
refer
to
the
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
offense.
but
if
that
is
a
use
of
the
firearm,
i
don't
understand
why
it's
also
not
a
use
of
a
firearm
for
a
drug
dealer
to
say
to
himself,
or
to
a
confederate,
we
can
undertake
this
transaction
with
full
confidence,
because
we
can
protect
ourselves
no
matter
what
happens.
surely
they
would
agree
that
that
is
a
use,
if
two
defendants
said
that
to
each
other.
i
don't
see
why
it's
not
a
use
if
one
defendant
says
it
to
himself.
the
firearm
serves
the
same
purpose.
and
that's
not
an
unusual
or
a
strained
application
of
the
word
use
in
our
language.
somebody
would
readily
say
that
they
use
a
firearm
to
enable
themselves
to
sleep
at
night
by
keeping
it
in
their
dresser
drawer
and
having
it
available,
or
that
they
use
a
burglar
alarm
to
protect
their
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
i've
tried
to
explain
that
the
evolution
of
this
statute
shows
why
the
normal
presumption
that
the
conjunction
of
two
words
must
have
different
meanings
shouldn't
be
rigorously
applied
in
this
case
with
the
ultimate
impact
of
defeating
congress'
intent.
originally,
the
use
and
carry
liability
under
the
statute
did
refer
to
quite
different
things.
use
had
to
be
use
to
commit
the
offense,
which
is
more
specific
than
the
current
statute,
and
carry
only
applied
when
a
firearm
was
carried
unlawfully.
when
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1984,
it
specifically
took
those
restrictions
off,
and
it
merged
the
liability
prong
of
the
offense
into
use
or
carries,
and
it
added
the
words,
during
and
in
relation
to,
to
describe
the
nexus,
which
is
a
very
loose
nexus,
but
i
think
the
upshot--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
in
relation
to,
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
makes
clear
that
a
gun
owner
who
has...
even
if
he
is
a
drug
dealer,
if
the
gun
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
drugs,
isn't
violating
this
statute.
there
has
to
be
some
prepositive
use.
the
juries
in
these
cases
were
instructed
that
there
had
to
be
a
knowing
and
intentional
use
of
the
firearm
in
relation
to
the
drug
trafficking--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
he
commits
an
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
going
to
be
an
issue
for
the
jury
to
determine,
and
yes,
justice
souter,
the
jury
could
determine
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
or
to
reject
the
inference
if
they
conclude
that
the
gun
had
simply
a
coincidental
relationship
to
the
offense
and
really
wasn't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
don't
think
that
it
was
necessary.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
think
it
is
whether
it
enables
him
to
carry
out
the
offense,
whether
he's
using
it
to
have
enough
confidence--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
he's
not
charged
with
that,
of
course.
he's
charged
with--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--using
the
gun
in
relation
to
the
drugs--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
don't
think
that
it's
essential
that
there
be
expert
testimony,
but
there
was
expert
testimony
in
this
case
that
described
the
habits
and
patterns
of
drug
dealers
and
the
frequent
association
of
firearms
with
them,
and
the
point
of
congress'
enactment
of
this
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
because
the
firearms
create--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
this
court
in
smith
adopted
the
broadest
reading
of
use
that's
consistent
with
dictionary
definitions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
for
several
reasons,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
the
rule
of
lenity
doesn't
justify
creating
an
ambiguity
in
a
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
same
distinction
could
have
been
drawn
in
the
smith
case,
and
this
court
quite
clearly
recognized
that
the
word
use,
as
employed
in
section
924(c),
had
its
natural,
broad
meaning
without
additional
qualifiers
that
limited
it,
such
as
active
use.
congress--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
true,
justice
o'connor,
that
it
involved
handling
the
firearm
and
trading
it,
but
it
is
not
the
first
use
of
a
firearm
that
springs
to
mind,
and
i
think
the
court
quite
correctly
recognized
that
it
wasn't.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
but
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
there
could,
but
the
way
that
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--because
the
court
resolved
the
issue
in
smith
not
by
saying
that
this
was
an
active
use,
and
that's
a
requirement
of
the
word,
but
by
adopting
the
definition
of
the
word
use
that
one
finds
if
one
looks
to
dictionaries.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
rationale
that
smith
used
in
order
to
decide
the
case.
smith
relied
on
the
fact
that
use
entails
more
than
paradigmatic
uses
of
a
gun,
that
it
covers
the
natural
dictionary
meanings,
and
that
it
applies
when
english
speakers
can
understand
that
the
object
is
being
put
or
employed
for
some
purpose
and
in
this
case,
all
of
those
requirements
are
satisfied.
i
contend
that
the
petitioner's
position
here
is
analogous
to
the
position
that
was
taken
by
the
defendant
in
smith,
that
you
should
add
words
to
the
statute
to
limit
what
congress
has
written,
and
that
is
not
a
reading
of
the
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
he
would
clearly
be
liable
under
the
carrying
prong.
whether
he
would
be
liable
under
the
use
prong
is
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
and
that
may
be...
that
is
the
example
that
i'm
thinking
of
that
may
differentiate
carrying
liability
from
use
liability.
in
fact,
in
the
reported
cases
that
have
addressed
the
issue,
i
haven't
seen
any
that
are
precisely
like
that,
but
if
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
find
a
distinction
between
the
two,
i
think
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
is
precisely
the
distinction
that
i
would
suggest.
again,
i
don't
think
that
in
the
context
of
this
statute
the
statute
is
best
read
as
requiring
that
one
looks
for
a
hypothetical
to
distinguish
the
two,
because
congress
clearly
had
a
broad
objective
in
mind.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
could
have,
and
the
sentencing
guidelines
have
a
provision--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
it
bears
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
it
won't
if
there
isn't
any
evidence
of
a
conjunction
between
the
two,
but
in
the
cases
that
we
would
bring
where
the
gun
is
found
right
with
the
drugs--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
without
more
facts,
it's
a
little
hard
to
say,
but
i
would
think
that
you're
right,
essentially
most
of
these
cases
will
go
to
the
jury,
and
the
reason
they
go
to
the
jury
is
that
the
firearms
are
found
in
strategic
places
where
they
facilitate
the
offense,
and
they
inject
the
very
danger
and
hazards
that
guns
have
in
these
kinds
of
transactions
that
congress
wanted
to
prohibit,
and
that
is
why
we
have
treated
these
cases
as
uses,
as
have
all
of
the
regional
courts
of
appeals.
it
would
be
strange
to
think
that
if
this
were
an
unnatural
or
somehow
foreign
way
to
use
the
word
use,
that
it
would
have
been
adopted
so
widely
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
if
that
was
a
sentencing
enhancement
statute,
it
could
be
written
that
way,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
been
long
understood--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
it's
a
separate
offense,
and
all
of
the
elements--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--have
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you
have
to
prove
that
he
engaged
in
a
drug
trafficking
offense--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
you
have
to
prove
that
there
was
a
use
or
carry,
and
you
have
to
prove
that
the
use
or
carry
was
during
and
in
relation
to
the
offense,
and
the
jury
was
instructed
on
all
of
those
elements
here.
now,
the
standard
that
petitioners
offer
for
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
review
in
this
case
would
require
reviewing
courts
to
go
over
a
number
of
different
factors
and
make
their
own
judgments
about
whether
the
firearm
that
was
found
is
consistent
with
the
kinds
that
drug
dealers
might
use,
or
whether
there
were
a
number
of
firearms
found
at
the
location,
and
would
inject
into
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
review
process
considerations
that
are
normally
foreign
to
that.
reviewing
courts
normally
leave
it
to
the
jury
to
draw
the
proper
inference
on
the
record
once
the
legal
standard
is
established
and
the
evidence
has
been
put
before
them.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
would
add--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
our
position
is
that
the
word
use
didn't
change
its
meaning,
but
the
word
use
takes
its
meaning
from
context,
and
in
the
original
version
of
this
statute,
use
was
embedded
in
the
phrase,
used
to
commit
any
felony,
and
the
connotation
of
used
in
that
context
may
require
a
higher
linkage
or
more
prepositive
use
of
the
gun
to
actually
carry
out
the
crime.
in
1984,
congress
deleted
that
qualification.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
legislative
history
that
specifically
addresses
the
meaning
of
the
term
use
and
attempt
to
define
it.
what
congress
addressed
in
the
legislative
history
was
the
impact
of
deleting
the
words
unlawfully
from
carries,
and
how
that
would
broaden
the
liability
for
carrying--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
was
in
a
senate
report,
senate
report
225--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
stand
corrected,
justice
scalia.
the
senate
committee
gave
several
examples
in
the
report
of
how
it
thought
the
new
statute
would
work,
particularly
in
conjunction
with
the
main
purpose
of
the
overhaul,
which
was
to
reverse
the
results
in
this
court's
decisions
in
united
states
v.
simpson
and
united
states
v.
busic,
which
prohibited
the
application
of
924(c)
when
the
underlying
predicate
felony
had
its
own
enhancement
provision.
and
in
the
course
of
discussing
that
change,
congress
gave
an
example
of
how
you
could
commit
armed
bank
robbery
and
be
subject
also
to
the
offense
of
using
or
carrying
a
firearm
under
section
924(c),
and
they
added
a
footnote
to
make
clear
that
even
if
you
didn't
do
what
is
paradigmatically
done
to
commit
a
bank
robbery
with
a
weapon,
namely
point
it
or
shoot
it,
you
could
still
be
liable
under
the
carrying
prong,
and
the
footnote...
the
footnote
then
continues
to
explain
that
the
carrying
prong
was
broadened
because
the
unlawfully
aspect
of
the
former
branch
of
liability
under
that
provision
had
been
deleted.
none
of
that
was
devoted
to
determining
what
kinds
of
uses
fell
within
the
statute.
the
basic
point
of
the
footnote
was
to
explain
the
ways
in
which
the
statute
had
been
broadened,
and
the
final
sentence
of
the
footnote
that
i
think
you're
referring
to
simply
made
clear
that
if
there's
no
conjunction
at
all
between
the
carrying
of
a
firearm
and
the
underlying
offense,
but
it
was
just
there
coincidentally,
then
you're
not
liable
at
all,
and
i
think
read
in
context,
that
committee
report
doesn't
shed
much
light
at
all
on
this
issue.
what
does
shed
light
on
the
issue,
i
believe,
is
that
when
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1984,
it
eliminated
the
qualifications
on
carrying
liability,
namely,
unlawfully,
and
on
using
liability,
namely,
using
to
commit.
they
had
given
them
different
connotations.
and
as
for
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
about
what
it
would
mean
if
you
put
an
ad
in
the
paper
and
said,
i'm
selling
a
firearm,
not
used,
that
would
also
certainly
be
true
if
you
had
acquired
the
firearm
because
it
had
been
bartered
for
drugs
but
it
had
been
contained
in
shrink
wrap.
the
meaning
of
the
word
use
in
section
924(c)
is
a
broader
meaning
than
that
which
could
be
applied
in
some
other
context.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
the
smith
opinion
explained
why
congress
chose
the
broader
form,
involved
in,
in
that
forfeiture
provision.
if
you
make
false
statements
on
an
application
to
acquire
a
firearm
license,
the
firearm
is
involved
in
that
offense,
although
it
wouldn't
be
used
in
the
offense,
i
think,
on
anybody's
understanding
of
that
word,
so
the
fact
that
there
were
broader
and
additional
verbs
that
were
put
in
the
forfeiture
provision
really
doesn't
shed
any
light
at
all
on
the
meaning
of
use.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
are
statutes--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--sometimes
we
talk
that
way
and
sometimes
congress
talks
that
way.
under
the
government's
theory
of
how
the
statute
evolved,
however,
that's
not
what
this
statute
meant.
in
other
words...
and
i
think
justice
breyer's
question
pointed
to
this.
the
government
also
concedes
in
this
case
that
prior
to
1984
use
and
carry
had,
as
they
put
it,
a
fundamentally
different
meaning
than
it
had
after
1984.
that
theory,
we
suggest,
simply
does
not
hold
up
if
you
look
at
the
available
evidence,
and
it's
somewhat
ironic,
because
the
possession
with
intent...
well,
the
drug
trafficking
offenses
were...
although
they
were
included
in
the
1968
version
of
the
statute,
they
were
eliminated
in
1984,
and
they
were
added
back
in
1986,
and
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
was
added
in
1988.
