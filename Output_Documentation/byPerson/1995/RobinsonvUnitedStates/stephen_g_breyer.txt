g.

i
just
want
you
to
have
a
chance
to
answer
the
question
i
had,
which
is,
what
happened
in
1984
that
is...
i
take
it...
the
dictionary,
at
least
to
me,
doesn't
answer
the
question.
it's...
you
can
have...
the
person
keeps
his
gun
in
the
drawer
the
whole
time
and
then
sells
it.
he
could
say,
used
gun,
never
used.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
it
isn't
going
to
tell
us.
that
makes
sense,
unfortunately...
or
fortunately,
it
makes
sense,
so
the
question
is,
what
does
it
mean
in
this
context,
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
yourself
say
that
prior
to
1984,
what
congress
had
in
mind
was,
you
take
the
gun
out
and
you
pull
the
trigger.
that's
using
it.
pointing
it,
that's
using
it...
hitting
somebody
over
the
head
with
it.
we
mean
something
active,
otherwise
we
wouldn't
have
added
the
word
carry.
now,
you
say
something
happened
in
'84.
well,
what
they
say
happened,
and
they
quote
a
lot
of
legislative
history,
they
say
what
happened
is,
all
that
happened
is
they
consolidated
these
provisions
and,
of
course,
they
added
this
other
gun,
but
it's
perfectly...
this
other
crime
about
possession.
it's
perfectly
reasonable,
in
possessing
with
intent
to
distribute,
sometimes
a
guy
takes
out
a
gun
and
points
it.
so
what
is
it
that
you
think
happened
in
'84
or
'86
that
in
your
view
radically
changed
the
meaning
of
the
word
use?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
deleted
it,
that's
right.
they
say
that
that
happened
because
that
was
grammatical,
in
context,
and
then
they
quote
some
legislative
history,
what
people
said
at
the
time
that
suggested
that
when
they
defined
carry,
because
they
focused
specifically
on
carry,
so
they
had
some
stuff
there
that
suggests
that
it
wasn't
intended
to
make
a
big
difference,
omitting
those
two
words,
to
commit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
say
no
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
what
you...
i
know
you
don't
think
that.
i
want
to
know
what
you
say
to
back
that
up,
your
view.
