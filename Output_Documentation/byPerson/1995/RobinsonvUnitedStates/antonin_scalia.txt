justice
antonin
scalia
lest
there
seem
to
be
too
much
agreement
between
you
and
justice
o'connor,
your
response
was,
if
it's
strategically
placed
and
visible
it
would
be
use,
but
let's
say
i
had
it
in
the
drawer
here,
so
it's
not
visible.
i'm
not
carrying
it.
it's
strategically
placed.
i
can
whip
open
the
drawer
and
get
to
it.
you
would
say
that
is
not
being
used.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least
shown...
it
has
to
be
at
least
shown.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
if
you
had
agents
stationed
around
the
room,
all
of
whom
were
carrying
firearms,
prepared
to
use
them,
you
would
not
be
using
firearms.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
your
agents
actually
used
the
firearms,
actually
pointed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
would
not
be
using
the
firearm.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you'd
say
you
could
use
a
weapon
without
carrying
it
by
having
some
remote...
remote
mechanism
of
discharge.
you
could
have
a
spring
trap,
or
all
sorts
of
ways,
have
the
gun
fired
from
the
other
side
of
the
room,
without
your
carrying
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
if
you
direct
one
of
your
goons
to
shoot
the
person?
you're
not
carrying
the
gun,
but
one
of
your
colleagues
is
and
you
say,
shoot
him.
are
you
using
the
firearm
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
might
you
also
be,
even
under
your
theory
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
direct
its
use
by
someone
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
we
followed
that
in
smith?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
we
follow
that
rule
with
respect
to
the
phrase,
use
a
firearm?
that's
an
exception
to
it,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be,
but
with
the
argument
you're
making
now,
with
the
rule
of
lenity,
was
there
any
less
ambiguity...
do
you
think
there
was
less
ambiguity
in
smith
than
there
was
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
use
goes
beyond
carry,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well
then,
how
do
you
explain,
let's
see,
5...
it's
on
page
la
of
the
petitioner's
appendix.
(b)...
way
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
if
a
person
sold,
delivered,
or
otherwise
transferred
a
handgun
or
ammunition
to
a
juvenile
knowing
or
having
reasonable
cause
to
know
that
the
juvenile
intended
to
carry
or
otherwise
possess
or
discharge
or
otherwise
use...
or
otherwise
use...
the
handgun
or
ammunition.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
the
firearm
were
traded,
exactly
as
occurred
in
smith,
would
that
be
use
within
the
meaning
of
this
statutory
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
used,
in
your
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
you're
not...
the
government's
not
making
the
argument,
i
take
it,
that
having
a
gun
in
a
locked
trunk
when
the
drug
transaction
is
being
completed
is
enough
to
constitute
its
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
his
possession.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
suppose
i
keep
the
drugs
under
my
bed,
and
i
have
the
gun
in
a
locked
trunk
two
rooms
away,
in
a
closet.
is
that
sufficient?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
is
it
possible
that
it's...
is
it
possible
that
it's
impossible
to
use
a
firearm
for
or
in
connection
with
some
of
the
felonies
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
the
controlled
substances
import
and
export
act,
or
the
maritime
drug
law
enforcement
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
every
single
felony
punishable
under
those
acts
can
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
testimony
on
this
stuff?
i
mean,
you
have
him...
did
he
take
the
stand
and
said
yeah,
i
was
really
comforted
by
that,
or
i
was
not
at
all
comforted
by
it?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
this
a
real--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
this
a
real
legal
issue?
that
is
the
issue
in
the
case,
whether
he
is
comforted
by
the
possession,
by
the
fact
that
the
gun
is
in
the
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can
see
that
if
you
adopted
your
opponent's
theory,
whether
he
brandishes
it,
and
so
forth,
but
you're
saying
the
mere
fact
that
he
has
a
gun
in
the
house,
a
jury
may
find
that
that
enables
him
to...
he's
using
that
in
the
possession
of
everything
in
the
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
he
has
to
have
is
the
gun
and
possessing
drugs
with
intent
to
distribute,
and
the
jury
can
find
that
he's
using
the
gun
in
order
to
possess
with
the
intent
to
distribute.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
often
use
firearms.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
real
sense
of
use
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
congress
had
a
broad...
but
congress
didn't
say,
although
i
suppose
it
could
have,
you
know,
anyone
who
possesses
drugs
and
who,
in
addition,
possesses
a
firearm,
shall
be
punished
with
an
additional
penalty.
i
suppose
it
could
say
that,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
much
further
than
what
you
say
they've
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
always
go
to
the
jury,
right,
virtually
always.
if
you
possess
drugs
and
own
a
gun,
it
will
get
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
always
a...
it's
my
gun,
it's
my
drugs.
that's
a
connection.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
who
addressed
it
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
say
what
the
senate
committee
addressed
in
the
legislative
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
aren't
there
a
lot
of
statutes
like
that?
i
mean,
that's,
you
know,
a
handy
rule
of
construction,
but
it's
not
rigid.
i'm
sure
there
are
a
lot
of
statutes,
for
example,
that
say
kill
or
injure.
no
one
shall
kill
or
injure.
maybe
the
endangered
species
act
says
that.
now,
it's
very
hard
to
kill
something
without
injuring
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
also
it's,
you
know,
it's
hard
to
use
it
without
carrying
it,
so
it's
just
making
clear
that
i
don't
only
mean
the
big
thing,
kill,
but
even
the
less
thing,
injure.
so
also
here
you
could
say,
i
not
only
mean
the
big
thing,
use,
i
even
mean
the
lesser
thing,
carry
but
not
use.
justices
talk
that
way
sometimes,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
untereiner,
you
agree
with
the
active-passive
distinction,
i
take
it,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
if
i
have
a
gun
lying
passively
on
the
table
within
a
few
feet
from
me,
that
is
an
active
use,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
i
have
a
gun
two
rooms
away
lying
passively
on
the
table,
or
passively
in
the
closet,
that
is
inactive
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
was
in
the
drawer,
though,
you
would
say
that
is
a
passive
use.
