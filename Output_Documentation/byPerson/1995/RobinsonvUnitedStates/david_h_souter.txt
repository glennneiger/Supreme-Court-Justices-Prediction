justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
agreed
with
you...
in
the
bailey
case,
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
use,
we'd
have
to
remand,
wouldn't
we,
because
the
lower
court...
with
the
exception
of
the
one
dissenting
opinion,
the
lower
court
didn't
get
into
carrying.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we'd
be
doing
it
in
the
first
instance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
don't
you
concede,
or
isn't
it
at
least
consistent
with
your
theory
to
concede
that
there
can
be
an
overlap
between
use
and
carry?
your
claim
is
there's
simply
got
to
be
a
distinctive
element
in
use
as
well.
use
cannot
totally...
or
a
distinctive
element
in
carry,
rather,
that
use
cannot
totally
swallow
up
carry.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
could
be
an
overlap,
and
there
could
have
been
an
overlap
in
justice
scalia's
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
yours
is
not
complete
and
the
government's
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
in
the
case
in
which
the
drugs
were
kept
in
the
locked
trunk,
and
the
trunk
is
in,
let's
say,
the
next
room,
your
theory
is
that
use
is
proven
by
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
drugs
were
put
in
the
trunk,
possessed
in
that
sense,
the
handgun
was
handy
and
therefore
was
used.
your
theory
is
not
that
it's
being
used
now,
with
the
trunk
locked
in
the
next
room
and
the
gun
in
the
trunk.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
am
i
continuing
to
use
the
gun?
on
your
theory...
i
thought
in
your
answer
to
the
last
question
your
theory
was,
well,
the
use
occurred
at
the
time
the
drugs
were
handled
and
put
in
the
trunk,
et
cetera,
because
the
gun
was
right
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
now--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
the
gun
also
being
used
after
the
trunk
is
locked
with
the
gun
in
it
and
the
drugs
in
it,
and
the
dealer
goes
into
the
next
room?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
could
give
that
away
and
still
win.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
the
connotation
of
use
you
were
proposing
would
have
given
a
yes
answer.
yes,
he
is
still
using
the
gun,
even
though
it's
in
the
next
room
with
the
trunk
and
the
drugs,
and
the
only
reason
i
asked
the
question
is,
i
thought
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question
concentrated
on
the
time
when
he,
the
drugs,
and
the
gun
were
all
together.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
theory
is
broader,
and
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--claiming
that
even
when
he's
in
the
next
room--
justice
david
h.
souter
--he's
still
using.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
true,
but
everybody
who
possesses
a
gun
constructively,
i
suppose,
has
that
same...
gains
that
same
confidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
they
use
use...
why
do
they
employ
use,
rather
than
possess?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
still
have...
the
statute
still
has
the
qualification
that
the
use
or
the
carrying
must
occur
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime,
a
specific
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
seems...
maybe
i'm
missing
your
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
qualification
renders
the
statute
just
as
specific
in
identifying,
as
it
were,
the
mode
of
use,
or
the
mode
of
carrying,
as
the
statute
was
before
the
amendment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
broad--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
word
crime
is
very
specific.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
on
your
theory
the
gun
owner
who
happens
to
have
the
gun
in
his
pocket
is
always
going
to
be
using
it
in
relation
to
as
well
as
during
the
offense
if
he
commits
a
drug
offense--
justice
david
h.
souter
--at
that
time.
so
it's
quite
true,
you
say
on
the
one
hand
yes,
the
in-relation-to
adds
something,
but
on
your
theory
it's
always
going
to
be
added.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
always
going
to
make
the
same
argument
and
the
jury
is
always
going
to
be
free
to
find,
in
fact,
that
he
was
comforted
by
having
the
gun
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
was
no
ambiguity
as
among,
or
as
between
several
active,
possible
active
uses,
but
there
still
can
be
an
ambiguity
as
between
active
and
passive
use.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
there
could,
then
why
shouldn't
the
rule
of
lenity
apply
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
perhaps
we
were
imprecise,
and
perhaps
smith
can
be
preserved
without
any
difficulty
if
we
simply
now
recognize
that
smith
was
a
choice
between
two
active
uses,
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
choice
between
active
and
passive.
