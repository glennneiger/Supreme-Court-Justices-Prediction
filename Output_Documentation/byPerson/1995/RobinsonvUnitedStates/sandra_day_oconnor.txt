justice

o'connor
mr.
untereiner,
was...
are
petitioners
in
either
of
these
cases
challenging
the
instructions
on
the
law
that
were
given?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
in
both
cases
it
amounts
to
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
question
for
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
you
tell
me
what
you
think
the
word
carry
means?
apparently,
in
neither
of
these
cases
did
the
indictment
or
a
jury
have
to
decide
whether
a
weapon
was
being
carried.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
bailey,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
under
this
statute
that
a
gun
could
be
carried
in
the
trunk
of
a
car--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
purposes
of
this
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
a
strategic
placement
of
a
firearm,
having
it
right
there
so
that
the
persons
with
whom
the
defendant
is
dealing
in
the
case
of
a
drug
sale
has
some
notion
of
the
power
available
to
the
defendant
at
that
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
kind
of...
i
don't
know
how
to
describe
it
better
than
a
strategic
placement
of
the
weapon.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
doesn't
have
to
be
held
in
the
hand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
did.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
be
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
dreeben,
under
your
interpretation
of
use,
which
is
quite
broad,
as
you
describe
it,
what
does
the
word
carry
add
in
addition,
or
would
every
offense
charged
under
the
use
prong,
as
you
would
define
it,
pick
up
the
word
carry
as
well,
automatically?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
one
reason
why
i
question
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
word
use
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
that
the
words
use
and
carry
might
refer
to
different
things,
and
that
use
might
be
a
word
that
envisions
something
more
than
mere
possession,
and
i'm
concerned
that
the
government
is
interpreting
it
so
broadly
that
it
swallows
up
the
word
carry,
and
swallows
up
the
offense
of
possession
of
a
weapon
while
committing
a
crime.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
people
do
use
the
word
that
way,
but
perhaps
that
isn't
how
congress
used
the
word
use,
because
it
had
a
separate
offense
for
possession,
and
a
separate
offense
for
transporting,
and
a
separate
term
carry,
and
so
we
have
to
try
to
figure
out
what
in
the
world
congress
meant
with
this
scheme.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
was
an
active
use,
mr.
dreeben.
to
trade
the
gun
for
drugs
is
a
form
of
active
use,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but--
--yes,
but
if
the
distinction
is
active
versus
passive,
it
was
an
active
use
to
the
extent
we're
concerned
about
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
consolidated
cases
come
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
petitioners
bailey
and
robinson
were
each
convicted
of
federal
drug
offenses
and
the
violating
18
u.s.
code
section
924(c)(1)
which
is
the
section
imposing
a
five-year
mandatory
minimum
term
of
imprisonment
upon
a
person
who
during
and
in
relation
to
any
drug
trafficking
crime,
uses
or
carries
a
firearm.
both
the
petitioners
argue
that
the
evidence
here
was
insufficient
to
support
a
finding
that
they
had
used
a
firearm
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
bailey’s
conviction
under
section
924(c)(1)
was
based
on
the
loaded
pistol
which
the
police
found
inside
the
bag
in
the
trunk
of
his
car.
after
he
was
arrested
for
possession
of
cocaine
found
in
a
car’s
passenger
compartment.
robinson’s
conviction
of
gun
use
was
based
on
the
unloaded
holstered
derringer
that
was
found
locked
in
a
trunk
in
a
bedroom
closet
during
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant
that
followed
control
buys
of
crack
cocaine
from
her
apartment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuits
sitting
en
banc
consolidated
the
two
cases
and
affirmed
both
convictions.
the
court
applied
an
accessibility
and
proximity
tests
to
determine
use
within
section
924(c)(1)
and
held
in
both
cases
the
firearm
was
sufficiently
excessively
and
proximate
to
the
drugs
or
drug
proceeds
that
the
jury
can
properly
invert
that
the
defendant
had
placed
the
firearm
in
order
to
further
the
drug
offenses
or
to
protect
possession
of
the
drugs.
we
granted
certiorari
to
settle
confusion
among
the
courts
of
appeals
as
to
the
proper
understanding
of
the
term
"use"
in
the
statute.
today,
we
hold
that
to
sustain
a
conviction
under
the
use
prong
of
section
924(c)(1),
the
government
must
show
that
the
defendant
actively
employed
the
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
the
predicated
crime.
the
statutory
term
"use"
must
connote
more
than
mere
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
person
who
commits
a
drug
offense.
if
congress
had
intended
the
statute
to
read
so
broadly
it
would
have
so
provided
as
it
has
for
example
in
many
other
drug
crime
statutes.
the
language,
the
context,
and
the
history
of
the
statute
indicate
that
congress
intended
use
to
have
an
active
meaning
in
the
sense
of
to
avail
oneself
of
or
to
convert
to
one
service.
while
a
broad
waiting
of
use
undermines
any
function
for
the
statutory
term
"carry"
the
more
limited
active
interpretation
of
'use'
preserves
a
meaningful
role
for
the
criminalization
of
carrying
a
firearm
as
an
alternative
basis
for
a
charge.
section
924's
statutory
context
as
well
as
its
amendment
history
but
resist
our
interpretation.
our
recent
decision
in
smith
versus
the
united
states
in
which
we
held
that
a
barter
of
a
gun
for
drugs
is
a
'use',
is
not
to
the
contrary.
although
there
we
decline
a
limit
to
term
"use"
to
use
as
a
weapon
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
nevertheless
adhered
to
an
active
meaning
of
the
term.
under
the
interpretation,
we
announce
today
"use"
can
include
acts
of
brandishing,
displaying,
bartering,
striking
with,
and
of
course
firing
or
attempting
a
firearm
and
it
can
even
include
reference
to
a
firearm
in
the
offender’s
possession.
having
determined
that
"use"
denotes
active
employment
we
have
to
conclude
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
either
bailey’s
or
robinson’s
conviction
for
"use"
under
the
statute.
both
judgments
are
reversed,
and
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
liability
under
the
"carry"
prong
of
the
statute.
we
remand
for
consideration
at
that
bases
for
upholding
the
convictions.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
