mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
consolidated
cases
present
the
question
of
what
it
means
to
use
or
carry
a
firearm
both
during
and
in
relation
to
a
predicate
drug
trafficking
offense.
section
925(c)
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code
makes
that
conduct
a
crime
punishable
by
stiff,
mandatory
minimum
sentences
ranging
from
5
years
to
life
imprisonment
without
release.
petitioners
roland
bailey
and
candisha
robinson
were
each
convicted
of
violating
section
924(c).
each
was
sentenced
to
5
years
imprisonment
on
that
count.
their
convictions
were
upheld
by
a
narrowly
divided
d.c.
circuit
sitting
en
banc.
the
facts
of
the
two
cases,
briefly
stated,
illustrate
the
broad
reach
given
to
section
924(c)
by
the
court
below.
candisha
robinson
was
convicted
of
using
or
carrying
a
small
firearm
known
as
a
derringer
during
and
in
relation
to
the
predicate
offense
of
possession
of
cocaine
with
intent
to
distribute
it.
her
section
924(c)
conviction
rested
almost
entirely
on
the
fact
that
the
derringer
was
found
unloaded
and
in
a
holster
inside
a
locked
footlocker
in
her
bedroom
closet.
there
was
no
evidence
that
ms.
robinson
ever
touched
the
firearm,
or
that
the
firearm
played
any
role
in
any
sale
of
narcotics.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
no,
we
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
your
honor,
i
believe
the
indictments--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--i
believe
the
indictment
included
uses
or
carries,
and
so
did
he
instructions
in
this
case.
we
maintain
that
by
carry,
congress
meant
to
bear
on
one's
person.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
no,
we
don't--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
at
most
that
would
be
transporting
the
weapon
and,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
section
924(b),
congress
included
the
word
transport
there,
and
we
think
there's
a
difference
between
carrying
and
transporting.
the
only
discussion
of
this
in
the
lower
court's
opinion
was
in
the
dissent,
and
judge
williams
went
through
an
analysis
why
that
was,
at
most,
transporting.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
court
can
and
should
reach
the
issue
of
what
it
means
to
carry--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--you
would
be,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
but
we
think
the
meaning
is
relatively
clear,
of
the
word
carries,
and
this
court
is
fully
capable
of
deciding
what
that
means.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
it's
possible
that
the
court
could
remand
that
issue,
but
we
think
that
the
issue
is
presented
in
this
case,
and
the
court
could
also
decide
it.
moreover,
what
the
government
really
tries
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
ignore
the
word
carry.
i
think
the
government
would
like
the
court
to
forget
that
the
word
carry
is
in
the
statute,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
fairly
simple,
and
that
is
that
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
word
use
reads
the
word
carry...
carries
out
of
the
statute.
according
to
the
government,
whenever
someone
possesses
a
firearm
so
that
it
emboldens
the
possessor,
or
might
be
available
for
protection
or
security,
that
is
a
use,
and
we
submit
that
whenever
someone
carries
a
firearm,
the
firearm
is
also
available
for
use,
and
it
also
emboldens
the
person,
so
if
the
government
is
right
that
congress
meant,
by
use,
what
it
says,
there
really
would
have
been
no
need
to
include
the
word
carries
in
the
statute.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
statutes
must
be
read
so
that
every
word
is
given
some
effect.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
we
suggest
that
the
word
use
means,
to
actively
employ
to
carry
out
the
predicate
offense.
by
active
employment,
we
mean
firing
the
weapon,
discharging
it,
brandishing
it,
displaying
it--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's...
that
was
this
court's
holding
in
smith.
we
think
that
that
holding
is
fully
consistent
with
our
definition
of
use.
in
smith,
the
court
held
that
trading
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
the
predicate
offense
of
attempting
to
possess
cocaine,
trading
a
firearm
for
the
cocaine
was
a
use
of
the
firearm,
and
we
think
that
was
an
active
employment
to
carry
out
the
predicate
offense.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--i
think
if
the
weapon
were
placed
in
an
open
area,
it
would
be
displayed,
and
that
would
fall
within
the
meaning
of
active
employment
as
we
understand
it.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct.
but
the
government
makes
much
of
placement.
it
says
that
possession
plus
placement
should
be
enough
to
qualify
as
liability
for
use,
and
we
think
there
are
several
problems
with
the
placement
theory.
for
one
thing,
i
think
that
placement
is
a
kind
of
preparatory
conduct.
it's
preparation
for
use,
it's
not
use.
secondly,
i
think
the
government
would--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that's
right.
within
the
meaning
of
active...
our
definition
of
use
would
not
include
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct,
and
the
reason
for
that,
if
it's
displayed,
it's
actually
having
an
effect
in
carrying
out
the
predicate
offense,
whereas
if
it's
hidden
somewhere,
all
it
does
is
embolden
the
possessor,
and
emboldening,
we
submit,
really
doesn't
add
anything
to
possession.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
justice
kennedy,
if
they
were
openly
displayed
in
a
crack
house--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that
would
not
be
a
use
under
our
theory,
that's
correct.
i'd
like
to
go
back
for
a
moment
to
this
placement
theory,
because
i
think
that
there's
another--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--well,
it
could
be
that
they
could
be
carried
in
some--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--and
they're
not
being
borne
on
that...
they're
not
on
the
person's
person.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that
would...
that's
correct,
that
would
not
be
a
use
under
our
theory.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
there
might
be
aiding
and
abetting
liability
under
the
carrying
prong
there,
but
there
wouldn't
be...
there
wouldn't
be
a
use.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
there
might
be
aiding
and
abetting
liability
for
use.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--indeed,
there
is
an
overlap
under
our
theory
of
the
statute
and
under
the
government's
theory
of
the
statute.
i
think
both
sides
have
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
there
is
a
substantial
overlap
in
terms,
but
justice--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that's
correct,
and
the
government
does
not
dispute
the
fact
that
its
reading
of
use
liability
would
render
the
word
carries
in
the
statute
superfluous.
the
government
does
not
dispute
that.
instead,
it
asks
this
court
to
create
an
exception
to
that
cardinal
rule
of
statutory
construction,
and
that
exception--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--certainly.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
displaying
a
firearm
could
be
a
use,
would
be
a
use--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that's
correct.
that's
one.
referring
to
a
firearm
could,
under
some
circumstances,
could
be
a
use.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
possibly.
if--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
in
general
use
is
narrower
than
carry.
that's
what
congress...
that
use
means
to
actively
deploy
the
weapon
as
an
instrument
of
the
predicate
offense,
and
carry
was
intended
to
pick
up
a
residual
category
of
cases
where
the
weapon
was
not
actually
deployed.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
in
that
example
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
use--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--use
will
certainly
cover
things
that
carry--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--doesn't
cover.
in
smith,
this
court--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--well,
we
actually
have
two...
we
have
an
alternative
definition
of
carries
which
is
slightly
broader,
but
nonetheless
would
not
be
a
basis
for
upholding
bailey's
conviction
under
carry.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
it's
activity
with
the...
it's
some
kind
of
activity
with
the
weapon
that
carries
out...
assists
in
carrying
out
the
predicate
offense.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
i
think
that
use
liability
would
require
that.
whether
it
would
require
that
because
the
use
wouldn't
be
in
relation
to
the
predicate
offense
unless
it
actually
helped
to
carry
out
the
predicate
offense,
or
whether--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct.
you
could
simply
refer
to
a
weapon
that
you
have
not
immediately
on
your
person,
and
that
would
be
a
use.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
you
may
be
liable
for
aiding
and
abetting
someone
else's
use,
someone
else's--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--it
might
be.
it
might
be
in
some
circumstances
a
use.
if
you
have
constructive--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--if
you
have
constructive
possession
of
a
weapon
by...
and
you
have
control
over
your
accomplice,
and
you
direct
that
it
be
used,
that
could
be
a
use,
i
suppose.
i'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
section
924(d)
as
well.
that's
the
forfeiture
provision
of
section
924.
in
smith,
this
court
explained
that
the
word
use
is
fairly
elastic,
and
must
be
understood
in
light
of
its
context
in
the
statute,
and
part
of
the
context
this
court
looked
at
in
smith
was
the
forfeiture
provision,
section
924(d).
now,
that
provision
makes
a
distinction
between
guns
that
are
used,
those
that
are
involved
in,
and
those--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--924(d)
is
in
our
opening
brief,
the
appendix,
page
3a.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
section
924(d)
draws
this
distinction
between
firearms
that
are
used,
those
that
are
involved
in,
and
those
that
are
merely
intended
to
be
used.
in
smith,
this
court
relied
heavily,
i
think,
on
this
provision,
because
these
words
make
cross-references
to
other
crimes
in
which
firearms
are
traded,
and
i
think
that
was
an
important
part
of
this
court's
holding
in
smith.
we
suggest
that
this
shows
congress
knows
full
well
that
there's
a
difference
between
using
a
firearm
and
merely
intending
that
the
firearm
be
used,
or
involving
a
firearm
in
a
predicate
offense.
the
government's
theory,
however,
would
collapse
that,
and
essentially
is
based
on
the
premise
that
congress
doesn't
know
how
to
distinguish
those
things,
and
rather,
when
it
says
use,
it
includes
all
of
those
things.
i'd
like
to
say
a
little
bit
also
about
the
rule
of
lenity
here.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
justice
ginsburg,
it's
quite
possible,
we
think,
that
a
firearm
can
be
actively
employed
in
a
predicate
offense
of
that
kind.
you
can
brandish
a
firearm
to
ward
off
a
rival
drug
dealer
who's
trying
to
take
away
the
drugs,
you
could
fire
it,
or
you
could
brandish
it
at
the
police
who
are
trying
to
arrest
you,
so
it's
quite
possible
that
active
employment
goes
together
with
even
a
passive
drug
crime
such
as
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
the
rule
of
lenity
is
an
important
principle
in
this
court's
jurisprudence.
it
says
that
when
a
statute
is
ambiguous,
a
conviction
based
on
language
that...
whose
scope
is
uncertain
should
be
reversed.
the
rule
serves
a
number
of
important
purposes.
it
ensures
that
everyone
has
fair
notice
of
what
conduct
constitutes
a
crime.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
the--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--i
think
the
majority
in
smith
concluded
that
the
level
of
ambiguity
was
not
sufficient
to
trigger
the
rule
of
lenity
in
smith.
i
think
the
dissent
had
a
good
point
that--
[laughter]
that--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--well,
i
think
in
smith,
your
honor,
the
court
was
looking
at
the
statute
as
a
whole,
and
i
think
here
again
the
language
of
section
924(d)
was
significant
because
of
this
distinction
between...
well,
the
fact
that
that
made
cross-reference
to
crimes
that
clearly
involved
trading
firearms,
and
i
think
that,
and
i
think
the
court,
the
majority
in
smith
was
also
somewhat
troubled
with
the
possibility
that
bludgeoning
someone
with
a
firearm
might
not
be
a
use
under
the
dissent's
theory.
those
considerations
really--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
ask...
no.
no,
we
don't
think
that...
we
think
smith
is
fully
consistent
with
our
theory
of
active
employment.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
we
do
believe
there
was
less,
yes--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--because
of
the
presence
of
subsection
(d),
the
forfeiture
provision,
where
the
word
use
also
appeared,
and
where
congress
was
making
a
cross-reference
to
crimes
where
a
firearm
was
traded,
and
i
think
that
the
court
relied
heavily
on
that
in
smith,
and
that--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
yes.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
we
think
that
that,
the
language
that,
justice
scalia,
you've
just
read
strongly
supports
our
position,
because...
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
1,
it
shows
that
the
phrase...
carry
or
otherwise
possess
shows
that
carry
is
a
particular
kind
of
possession,
and
that
the
only
kind
of
possession
that
congress
has
made
a
crime
under
924
(c)
is
carrying,
whereas
the
government,
i
think,
suggests
that
other
kinds
of
possession
would
qualify
as
use
under
924(c).
the
second
half
of
that,
discharge
or
otherwise
use,
i
think
suggests
under
the
various
cannons
of
construction
that
this
court
otherwise
applies
that
use
is
a...
that
discharge
is
a
kind
of
use,
and
it
must
be
of
the
same
kind,
that
the
broader
category,
use,
refers
to
a
kind
of
employment
of
the
weapon
that
discharge
is
an
example
of,
and
i
think
that's
fully
consistent
with...
indeed,
i
think
it
supports
our
active
employment
reading
of
the
statute.
we'd
like
to
also
remind
the
court
that,
when
all
is
said
and
done,
this
case
is
really
about
a
choice
between
two
sentencing
regimes.
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
there's
a
two-level
enhancement
for
possession
of
a
firearm,
so
really,
if
the
court
accepts
our
argument
in
this
case,
it
doesn't
mean
that
conduct
like
that
involved
in
this
case
will
go
unpunished.
it
will
go
punished,
instead,
under
a
two-level
enhancement
under
the
sentencing
guidelines.
and
as
justice
breyer
explained
in
his
mcfadden
dissent
on
the
first
circuit,
the
sentencing
guidelines
reflect
a
more
calibrated
and
nuanced
and
sophisticated
approach
to
sentencing
than--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
court
should
strive
not
to
read
use
in
924(c)
in
a
way
that
simply
eradicates
another
provision
of
federal
law,
namely,
the
two-level
enhancement
provision.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
well,
we
think
that
the
statutory
construction
argument
is
also
available
in
that
situation,
and
i
guess
that's
the
argument
we're--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--i
think
that
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
for
two
reasons,
number
1,
that
was
a
case
about
carrying.
a
lot
of
the
subsequent
cases
that
cited
that
did
not
make
that
distinction,
and
seized
on
this
later
language
in
that
opinion
that
talked
about
emboldening.
number
2,
the
case
was
not
about
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
if
you
read
that
case
carefully,
you'll
see
it
was
a
case
about
an
instructional
error,
and
the
court
reversed
because
the
instruction
was
deficient,
so
any
statement
in
that
case
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
i
mean,
there
was
some
discussion
in
there,
but
it's
not
necessary
to
the
outcome
of
that
decision.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
yes.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
a
firearm
traded
as
in
smith.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
yes,
within
the
meaning
of...
yes.
under
our
definition,
that
would
be
a
use
of
the
firearm.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
because
in...
because
you
are...
you...
it's
activity
with
the
weapon
in
such
a
way
that
you
carry
out
the
predicate
offense.
the
predicate
offense
in
smith
was
attempt
to
possess
cocaine.
that
attempt
was
carried
out
by
offering
to
trade
what
was
in
that
case
the
machine
gun
for
the
drugs,
so
we
think
that
falls
squarely
within
our
definition
of
the
active
employment.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
i
think
that
justice
o'connor
put
her
finger
on
a
critical
flaw
in
the
government's
theory
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
its
interpretation
of
use
reads
the
word
carries
out
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
government
conceded
that,
that
under
its
theory
the
word
carries
has
no
independent
meaning.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct.
we
say
that
active...
that
use
means
active
employment
to
carry
out
the
predicate
offense.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that
is
a...
it
can--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--the
issue
is,
what
is
the
defendant
doing,
if
anything,
with
the
firearm,
and
in
your
first
hypothetical,
i
think
it
could
be
said
if
the
firearm
is
visible
that
the
defendant
is
displaying--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--the
firearm.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
that's
correct.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
these
convictions
be
reversed.
