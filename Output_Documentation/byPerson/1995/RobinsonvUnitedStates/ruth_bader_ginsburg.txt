justice
ruth
bader

except
that
this
court
operates
as
a
court
of
review
and
not
first--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
definition
of
carry
is
it's
on
your
person,
because
you
excluded
having
it
in
the
trunk.
having
it,
say,
in
the
seat
next
to
you
in
the
car
wouldn't
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
want
to
concentrate
here
on
use,
as
i
understand
it,
and
from
what
you've
been
saying,
am
i
correct
in
gathering
that
use
means,
as
you
define
it,
something
perceivable
by
another
human
on
the
premises?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
a
concealed
weapon
can't
be
seen,
so
you
say
that's
carry
but
not
use.
are
you
saying
that
use
has
to
be
something
that
another
perceives?
you
use
the
example
of
placement,
not
mere
placement
in
a
drawer,
but
visible
placement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
untereiner,
may
i
ask
you
how
your
definition,
your
active
definition
of
use,
fits
in
with
one
of
the
underlying
crimes,
and
that's
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
which
is
a
passive
crime,
no
activity
involved,
so
how
do
you
get
an
active
use
tied
together
with
such
an
offense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
concentrate
on
this
crime.
this
is
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
can
you
explain
to
me
what
difference,
if
any,
there
is
in
using
a
firearm
in
relation
to
a
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
and
possessing
a
firearm?
did...
does...
are
you
treating
the
two
as
synonymous?
you
seem
to
be
from
the
answers
you've
been
giving.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
when
congress
said
use
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
offense--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
would
have
achieved
the
same
purpose
if
it
had
said
possessed,
so
that
the
word
use
in
your
view
is
not
narrower
than
the
word
possess
would
be
in
that
context.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
connecting
it
to
the
words,
in
relation
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
your
view
is,
congress
could
have
picked
either
word.
they
would
have
accomplished
the
same
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
an
active
use,
and
you
have
suggested
that
one
might
say
the
gun
that's
hidden
in
my
drawer,
i
use
the
gun
for
protection,
but
one
might
equally
say
about
a
gun
that
one
has
bought
and
never
fired,
i
bought
a
gun
but
i've
never
used
it,
or
i
don't
use
it.
those
are
two
uses
of
the
word
use.
if
we
have
a
rule
of
lenity
and
it's
a
criminal
statute,
why
don't
we
pick
the
narrower
one,
the
one
that
implies
active
use?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
gave
you
two
distinct
uses.
one
is,
it's
in
my
drawer,
i've
never
fired
it,
but
i
say,
i
use
it
for
protection.
