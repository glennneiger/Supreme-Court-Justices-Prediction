you
mean,
you
would
say
the
same
if
this
were
a
crack
house
with
machine
guns
strategically
placed,
to
use
justice
o'connor's
phrase,
at
various
points
where
they
could
be
easily
turned
on
anybody
who
was
trying
to
get
into
the
house?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
they're
concealed,
but
they're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
take
it
that
the
reason
is
you
have
to
draw
a
line
some
point,
and
so
you
want
to
show
that
there
was
an
actual,
active
employment,
that
it
was
being
used.
suppose
in
the
crack
house
example
they
had
two
or
three
people
go
to
man
the
machine
guns
to
be
at
the
ready.
that
wouldn't
be
a
use?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
they
had
two
or
three
people
manning
the
machine
guns,
but...
at
least
close
by,
but
they
were
concealed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
they're
not
carried,
they're
in
a
fixed
place.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
an
intentional
part
of
the
crime,
and
that
we
infer
that
intent
from
all
the
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
nexus,
it
seems
to
me,
is
important.
you
say
some
people
sleep
better
if
they
have
firearms.
assuming
that's
true,
then
i
suppose
that
the
71
percent
of
adults
in
rural
america
who
have
guns
use
guns
for
almost
everything
they
do.
if
that
gun...
in
your
sense
of
the
word,
if
the
gun
is
in
the
home,
or
the
farmhouse,
say,
then
they're
using
the
gun
for
almost
everything
they're
doing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
congress
intended
to
pick
that
up,
especially
when
it
has
the
extra
phrase,
in
relation
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
comment
on
petitioner's
argument
with
respect
to
subsection
(d)
of
the
statute,
which
uses
the
term,
involved
in
or
used?
