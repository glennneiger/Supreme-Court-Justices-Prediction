ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
first
address
a
number
of
administrative
problems
that
justice
breyer
asked
about.
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
that
question
on
the
other
side
of
the
issue
here,
and
that's
the
first
amendment
speech
that's
at
issue
here.
this
is
speech
that
lies
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment.
it's
speech
on
matters
of
public
concern,
and
often
contractors
are
in
a
unique
position
to
have
information
and
to
have
an
informed
opinion
about
government
functioning
because
of
their
relationship
with
the
government.
the
court
recognized
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
content
neutral
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions
could
certainly
be
placed
on
employees.
that's
not
a
problem
whatsoever.
when--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
government
certainly
would
have
a
right
to
terminate
a
contract
if
that
provision
was
necessary
to
the
effective
performance
of
the
contract.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
if
it
was
content
based,
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
kind
of
action
that
the
government
can
take.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
put
terms
in
the
contract
that
are
necessary
to
its
effective
performance.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
believe
that
because
of
the
content
based
nature
of
it
there
would
have
to
be
some
kind
of
stronger
government
interest.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
guess
it's
how
you
define
politics,
your
honor.
if
it
permitted
neighborhood
gossiping
or
other
kind
of
speech
that
could
have
that
same
effect
and
excluded
political
speech,
that
would
be
a
content
based
restriction.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
if
it
were
limited
to
one
topic
we
think
that
would
raise
problems
of
content
based
regulation.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
that
it
really
depends
on
the
contract
we're
talking
about,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor,
unless
there's
a--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--if
the
contract
is
to
communicate
the
government's
speech,
certainly,
and
if--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no.
the
government's
interest
is
in
the
performance--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--of
the
contract,
and
that
interest
is
what's
central
to
determining
what
analysis
should
be
applied
in
these
cases.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
government's
interest
in
the
performance
of
a
contract
can
effectively
be
protected
by
the
government
being
free
to
take
any
action
when
the
government
can
establish
that
it
materially
and
directly
impairs
the
performance
of
the
contract.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
also
think
that
on
those
questions--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
we
think
it--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
there
may
be
situations,
for
example,
i
think
in...
yes,
i
guess
is
the
answer
to
that
question,
with
that
hypothetical.
i
think
it's
important
to
focus,
though,
your
honor,
these
are
very
context
specific
cases.
pickering
has
recognized
that
and
hasn't
set
down
a
blanket,
easy
test
to
apply.
it
looks
at
the
context
of
each
case,
and
we
think
that
that
is
comparable
in
this
situation.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no.
we
don't
think
that
the
deference
that
is
given
the
government's
interest
as
an
employer
that
underlies
pickering
applies
here.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we...
the
federal
government
has
no
interest
in
having
contractor
speech
attributed
to
it.
as
you
pointed
out
earlier,
one
of
the
differences
in
the
government
interests
between
the
employee
situation
and
the
contractor
situation
is
whether
the
speaker's
speech
is
attributed
to
the
government.
the
government
doesn't
have
any
interest
in
policing
contractors'
speech
and
having
it
attributed
to
it.
it's
a
very
different
situation
with
the
employment
context,
where
the
government
has
the
interest
that
pickering
recognized.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
should
restate
my
position,
your
honor.
we
think
when
the
relationship
in
the
contracting
situation
is
equivalent
to
an
employment
context,
pickering
should
apply.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
of
proof
whether
or
not
that
fact--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
prove
that
their
speech
on
matters
of
public
concern
was
a
substantial
motivating
factor
in
the
government's
action,
where
the
government
could
establish
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
that
speech
materially
and
directly
impaired
the
performance
of
the
contract.
in
that
particular
situation,
if
it
was
in
the
context
where
residents
of
that
housing
authority
did
not
believe
that
the
security
guards
would
prevent
them,
it
somehow
impaired
a
trust
relationship
between
security
guards
and
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
a
balancing
test
of
the
interest
between
the
government
and
the
speaker,
but
i--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
not
pickering
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
that
the
inherent
interest
underlying
pickering,
the
government's
interest
in
coworker
relationship,
in
supervisory
discipline,
and
in
the
functioning
of
a
work
place
where
they're
all
government
employees
there,
that
is
a
weight
that
is
given
a
lot
of
deference
in
pickering.
i
normally
think
that
when
people
are
talking
about
pickering
balancing,
that's
always
in
the
scale,
and
that
would
not
be
in
the
balance
when
we
talk
in
terms
of
government
contractors.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
would
be--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
because
pickering
was
motivated
by
the
fact
that
the
interest
of
the
government
as
employer
is
consistent
in
the
employee
relationship
category.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that
there
are
certain
situations
like
respondents
here.
there's
just
none
of
the
factors
that
were
present
in
pickering.
there
was
no
day
to
day
supervision.
there
was
no
relationship
with
the
supervisor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
submit
that's
what
underlies
pickering.
what
justifies
government
action
under
pickering
is
the
impairment
of
the
functioning
of
the
government,
of
the
work
place,
and
that's
the
same
interest
in
this
case,
but
it's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--thank
you,
your
honor.
