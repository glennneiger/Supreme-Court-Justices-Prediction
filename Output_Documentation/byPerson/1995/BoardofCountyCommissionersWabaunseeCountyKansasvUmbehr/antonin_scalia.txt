justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
our
patronage
cases
were
decided
as
free
speech
cases
under
the
first
amendment.
what
were
they
decided
under
if
it
wasn't
under
that
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
that
the
free
speech
in
question
was
not
free
speech
regarding
partisan
politics,
but
why
would
that
make
any
difference?
how
would
you
distinguish
the
patronage
cases?
they're
decided
as
first
amendment
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
we
could
hold
for
you
in
this
case,
but
in
a
later
case
where
the
contractor
says,
i
don't
like
republicans,
we...
and
i'm
going
to
vote
democratic,
we
could
allow
that
contract
to
be
denied,
because
after
all,
the
speech
in
this
case
is
partisan
political
speech
and
it's
okay
to
discriminate
against
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
have
acknowledged
in
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
that
this
is
to
some
extent
a
balancing
question.
it's
not
an
absolute
right.
where
you
have
in
patronage
cases,
you
say,
a
greater
interest
on
the
part
of
government,
you
may
not
apply
the
same
rule
you're
urging
on
us
here,
and
you
may
allow
the
discrimination
on
a
partisan
basis,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
balance
to
some
extent.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
don't
you
balance
on
the
other
end
as
well?
you
assert
that
this
case
is
just
like
a
federal
employee,
just
like
a
government
employee
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that,
you
know,
similar
rules...
is
having
the
government
contract
as
important
as
having
a
government
job?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
government
interest.
i'm
talking
about
the
interest
of
the
person
asserting
the
first
amendment
right.
what
he's
being
deprived
of
in
one
set
of
cases
is
employment
by
the
government,
which
is
livelihood,
which
is
bread
on
the
table.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
somewhat...
isn't
that
a
much
greater
interest
than
being
deprived
of
a
contract
with
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
patterson,
i
confess
not
to
understand
what
proposition
you're
defending
here.
are
you
prepared
to
defend
the
proposition
that
if
the
government
has
no
reason
for
terminating
this
contract
except...
no
reason
at
all,
except
the
individual's
criticism
of
government
operations,
that
that
termination
is
nonetheless
lawful,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
are
not
defending
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
government
has
another
reason,
well,
i
mean,
that's
no
problem
at
all.
i
don't
think
anybody's
arguing
that
if
the
government
has
another
reason
to
fire
him,
to
terminate,
that
it
wouldn't
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say,
you
know,
i
have
a
good
reason
to
terminate,
and
i'm
also
glad
to
terminate
it
because
he
said
some
bad
things
about
me.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
van
kirks,
if
i'm
a
government
contracting
officer
for
some
county,
and
the
person,
one
of
the
bidders
for
the
contract
comes
in,
and
he
curses
me
out,
he
says,
you're
a
blankety
blank
blank
blank,
you
know,
and...
very
offensively,
and
the
guy
goes
off,
and
i
say,
boy,
i'm
darned
if
i'm
going
to
give
the
contract
to
him,
that's
unconstitutional,
you're
telling
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
is
the
constitution
really
that
silly?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
on
core
matters
of
public
concern,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
he
said,
you
know,
i...
you
are
a
disgrace
to
the
public
service,
you're
the
worst
contracting
officer
i've
ever
dealt
with,
and
you
ought
to
be
impeached,
that...
then
we
have
a
different
situation.
he
just
has
to
be
careful
how
he
curses
me
out,
is
that
it?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it's
always
a
lawsuit.
you
say
in
your
brief
that
it's
no
big
deal,
there's
not
going
to
be
a
whole
lot
of
litigation,
after
all
the
federal...
it's
either
you
or
the
government
says,
you
know,
there
hasn't
been
a
whole
lot
of
litigation
against
the
federal
government
and
it
points
to
these
wonderful
federal
government
contractual
regulations.
you
expect
every
municipality
and
county
in
the
country
to
have
aspa
regulations?
have
you
ever
looked
at
the
government's
contracting
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
they
are
a
maze,
and
it
takes
a
very
good
lawyer
to
negotiate
his
way
through
it,
and
if
that's
the
proof
that
we
are
not
going
to
unleash
a
mass
of
litigation
that's
unmanageable,
it's
not
a
very
good
demonstration.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
i'm
a
municipality
and
i
want
to
hire
private
guards,
let's
say,
for
housing
projects
or
something
like
that,
and
i
have
several
applicants,
one
of
whom
is
a
reputable,
goo
goo
organization,
unimpeachable
people,
the
other
one
of
which
is
an
acknowledged
racist
organization
which
preaches
racism,
i
have
to,
as
the
government
official,
say,
well,
it's
a
government
contract.
i
cannot
favor
one
view
over
the
other.
whoever
comes
in
with
the
lowest...
lower
bid--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they're
not
going
to
be
racist
in
their
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
both
going
to
do
the
same
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
extraordinary.
can't
the
government
favor
some
ideas
over
other
ideas,
and
when
it
gives
away
money,
can't
it
give
away
money,
for
example,
to
organizations
during
a
time
of
war
that
are
supporting
the
war
effort--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
not
give
away
money
to
organizations
that
are
impeding
the
war
effort?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
so
long
as
it's
not
doing
that,
it
has
to
allow
its
funds
to
be
used
to
subsidize
even
the
most
obnoxious
ideas.
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
don't
you
see
our
rule
on
shelley.
you
really
think
we
don't
take
into
account
that?
i
mean,
i
don't
think
we'd
write
the
opinion
that
way,
but
do
you
really
think
courts
are
oblivious
to
the
real
life
consequences
of
rulings
that
they
make?
are
you
really
saying
that's--
--i'm
not...
i'm
not--
--an
irrelevancy
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
contractor
matter
of
public
concern?
that
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
isn't
the
contract
with
a
public
entity,
the
terms
of
that
contract
a
matter
of
public
concern?
i
would
think
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
should
it
be?
why?
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it
would
cause
too
much
litigation?
but
you've
rejected
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
core...
core...
okay,
core
matters
of
public
concern,
which
wouldn't
include
whether
the
terms
of
a
very
expensive
contract
that
the
county
had
entered
into
are
being
abided
by
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
involve
contract
terms,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
we'll
have
to
litigate
it,
i
guess,
to
figure
out
for
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
would
limit--
--and
if
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
speech,
then
as
between
the
boy
scouts
and
the
kkk
the
government
can't
discriminate
between
the
two,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
it's
making
no
speech
restrictions,
the
government
can't
say
we'd
rather
have
the
boy
scouts
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
contract
to
pick
up
garbage,
and
we
know
that
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
political
discussion,
okay.
they're
different
garbage
men
than
i
have.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you're
saying.
the
government
cannot
possibly
use
its
authority,
its
contracting
authority
to
foster
any
policies
or
ideas
that
it
thinks
are
desirable.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
contract
isn't
that.
it's
a
contract,
let's
say,
to
make
a
movie
about
the
army
or
something
like
that,
and
it
cannot
decline
to
give
that
movie
contract
to
a
pornographic
film
maker.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
good
argument
for
restricting
the
scope
of
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
pornographic
film
making,
or
burning
crosses,
right,
so
long
as
that
doesn't
interfere
with
the
picking
up
of
the
garbage
or
the
making
of
film?
