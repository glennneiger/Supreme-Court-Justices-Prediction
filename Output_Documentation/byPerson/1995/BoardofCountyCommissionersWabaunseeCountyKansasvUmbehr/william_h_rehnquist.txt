chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-1654,
the
board
of
county
commissioners
of
wabaunsee
county,
kansas,
v.
keen
umbehr.
mr.
patterson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--one
way
to
distinguish
the
cases
like
elrod
and
rutan
from
this
case,
certainly,
is
to
say
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
in
the
political
patronage
cases,
if
i
may
refer
to
them
as
that,
there
was
the
interest
in
political
organization
and
that
sort
of
a
thing
that
apparently
is
not
present
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
patterson,
the
opinion
of
the
tenth
circuit
on
page
10a
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
says,
speaking
of
the
contractor,
he
claims
monetary
injury
from
the
termination
of
the
contract,
and
there's
no
dispute
that
such
injury
is
fairly
traceable
to
defendant's
actions
in
terminating
the
contract.
it's
fairly
alleged,
an
injury
caused
by
defendants.
accordingly
mr.
umbehr
has
standing.
now,
we
take
those
facts
as
found
by
the
tenth
circuit.
we're
not
going
to
go
back
and
examine
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you're
saying,
then,
the
real
reason
for
his
termination
was
not
his
speech
but
some
mount
healthy
type
of
reason,
a
totally
independent
basis,
but
that's
not
what
this
case
is
here
for.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
contractor,
the
governmental
agency
always
has
the
right...
perhaps
it
has
to
be
pursued
through
litigation...
of
saying,
we
are
not
dismissing
him,
we're
not
discontinuing
him
because
of
his
speech,
we're
discontinuing
him
because
of
unsatisfactory
performance,
or
failure
to
perform.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made,
and
feel
free
to
differ,
that
the
government's
interest
in
the
contract
situation
is
not
as
strong
as
the
government's
interest
in
the
employee
situation.
if
you
have
an
employee
in
the
district
attorney's
office
that
goes
public
saying,
you
know,
things
are
really
balled
up
here,
or
something
like
that,
it
really
can
impair
the
efficiency
and
operation
of
that
office
as
well
as
its
reputation,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
an
independent
contractor
saying
things
are
wrong
with
the...
no
one
attributes
those
remarks
to
the
agency
itself.
it's
much
more
of
an
adversary
situation,
and
perhaps
the
county
doesn't
have
the
same
interest
in
wanting
to
present
a
united
front
among
its
employees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
patterson.
mr.
van
kirk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
roth
v.
the
board
of
regents
at
least
form
a
springboard
for
your
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
said
the
same
thing
to
the
commissioners
in
private
after
the
meeting
it
would
be
a
different
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
self
censorship,
perhaps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
public
contractor,
or
the
hired
contractor
hauling
trash
in
justice
o'connor's
example
says,
you
know,
to
every
person
he
hauls
trash
from,
vote
republican,
or
vote
socialist,
or
something
like
that,
and
the
county
says,
we
just
don't
want
our
trash
haulers
to
go
around
making
political
campaigns.
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
on
that
subject.
can
they
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how--
--isn't
there
a
difference,
mr.
van
kirk,
between
the
government's
initial
decision
to
hire
someone
and
the
government's
decision
to
terminate?
might
not
there
be
different
levels
of
scrutiny
applied
to
one
as
to
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
van
kirk.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
an
answer
to
justice
souter's
question.
yes,
how
about
that
term?
don't
talk
politics
to
homeowners
when
you're
picking
up
their
garbage.
violation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
content
based
about
that?
just
don't
talk
any
kind
of
politics.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
an
extraordinary
argument
for
the
government
to
be
making.
certainly
the
federal
government
is
going
to
be
getting
the
same
deference
as
a
county
commission,
and
it
seems
to
me
extraordinary
for
the
federal
government
to
come
in
and
say,
we
don't
think
we
get
much
deference
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
i
think
of
all
the
contracts
the
government
must
have,
the
federal
government,
i
can't
imagine
that
some
situation
wouldn't
arise
where
there's
going
to
be
some
issue
like
this,
and
you're
saying,
in
effect,
we
want
the
most
stringent
rule
possible
to
be
invoked
against
the
government,
and
here
you
are
a
government
attorney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
