justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is
it?
why
is
a...
for
example,
wouldn't
it
just
have
to
say,
it
depends?
i
mean,
why...
a
temporary
employee,
somebody
who
is
provisionally
hired
for
6
months
at
a
government
summer
camp
i
take
it
is
protected
in
that
6-month
job
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
while
mcdonnell
douglas,
which
employs
400,000
people...
i'm
making
that
up,
obviously,
but
their
lifeblood
depending
on
this
contract,
i
take
it
under
your
theory
you
have
to
concede
that
the
first
amendment
would
apply
to
what
the
4-month
employee
at
the
summer
camp,
there
provisionally,
might
happen
to
say,
but
on
your
theory
it
wouldn't
apply
to
all
of
mcdonnell
douglas,
on
which
the
entire
economy
of
southern
california
depends,
so
i
mean,
how
can
we
say
that
one
in
principle
is
more
important
than
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
remember,
the
court
has
talked
about
the
first
amendment
applying
to
protect
probationary
employees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
people
who
don't
have
permanent
jobs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
are
there
just
for
a
moment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
arguing
for
a
rule,
i
take
it,
that
applies
to
all
contractors,
or
are
you
saying
that
there
are
just
certain
contractors
that
are
free
of
the
first
amendment--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
do
you
say
about
mr.
patterson's
interest
that
he
raised?
i
mean,
as
i
took
what
he
was
saying,
he
was
saying,
all
right,
concede
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
first
amendment
applies.
the
interesting
question
is
the
shape
of
that
first
amendment
right,
and
what
i
thought
he
was
trying
to
raise,
which
sounded
logical
anyway,
is
think
of
the
$400
billion
or
so
being
spent
by
state
and
federal
governments
on
different
kinds
of
contracts
with
people.
many
of
these
people
are
large
firms.
they
employ
thousands
or
hundreds
of
people.
they
have
large
groups
of
lawyers.
they
are
very,
very
interested
in
maintaining
the
government
moneys.
each
of
the
thousands
of
people
who
work
for
government
employment
contractor
x
speak
every
day.
they
spend
all
day
speaking.
now,
if
suddenly
there
are
rights
to
bring
1983
actions
for
which
you
get
attorney's
fees
every
time
a
government
is
contracted,
and
that's
a
very
large
right,
and
depends
on
what
any
of
these
400,000
might
be
saying,
and
somebody
might
say,
i'm
going
to
vote
republican,
i
urge
you
to
do
the
same,
i'm
going
to
vote
democrat,
i
urge
you
to
do
the
same,
all
of
which
leads
to
a
case
being
brought
under
1983
by
the
paid
lawyers
who
will
get
their
attorney's
fees,
which
makes
it
very,
very
difficult
for
the
government
to
operate
its
contract
operation,
indeed,
it
will
lead
the
government
to
remove
all
discretion
from
contracting
officers
and
operate
on
the
basis
of
how
many
bricks
you
have,
or
how
many...
so
it's
totally
objective,
et
cetera.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
he's
worried
about,
and
i
don't
think
that's
an
illogical
thing
to
be
worried
about,
and
that
doesn't
exist
in
the
employee
cases,
and
it
doesn't
exist
in
the
race
cases,
and
it
doesn't
exist
in
the
sex
cases
to
the
same
degree.
i'm
trying
to
put
his
argument,
and
that's
what
i'm
very
interested
in,
myself,
that
either
you
or
the
solicitor
general
at
some
point
respond
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
suggesting
it
because
i
want
to
hear
the
response.
that
is
to
say,
what
for
the
sake
of
argument...
that
sounds
to
me
what
is
a
very
strong
governmental
interest
the
way
he
put
it,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
first
amendment
is
ignorant
or
unaware
of
the
way
in
which
these
principles
work
out
in
reality.
the
government
has
to
be
able
to
function,
and
all
that's
built
into
pickering,
and
i'm
trying
to
get
a
rather...
i've
been
at
some
length
because
i...
it's
a
serious
question,
i
think,
and
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
express
myself
well
if
i
meant
to
go
on
just
numbers.
i'm
trying
to
draw
a
little
picture
of
what
he's
talking
about
when
he
says
administrative
problems
that
interfere
with
the
practical
administration
of
the
contracting
system.
