justice
david
h.
souter
--i
thought
this
was
a...
not
a
rebidding
of
the
contract,
i
thought
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
contract,
and
what
your
clients
did
was
to
cancel
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
did
not
exercise
their
option
not
to
renew--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
they
had
done
nothing
would
the
contract
have
continued--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
they
had
done
nothing,
would
the
contract
have
continued?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
this
wasn't
a
mere
matter
of,
as
i
think
you
were
saying
to
justice
breyer,
of
leaving
this
contractor
in
the
position
that
he
would
have
been
in
relation
to
other
intending
contractors,
if
your
clients
had
done
nothing.
it
was,
in
fact,
a
considerable
readjustment
of
the
contractor's
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
to
a
different
question?
you
alluded
a
moment
ago
to
the
government
interest.
in
the
case
of
the
government's
interest
when
dealing
with
an
employee,
in
the
kind
of
obvious
case,
one
is
concerned
about
the
capacity
of
the
government
to
continue
to
function
administratively
within
government
offices
when
someone
is
disruptively
criticizing.
what
is
the
government
interest
here?
how,
specifically
in
this
case,
was
the
county
rendered
at
a
disadvantage
in
doing
whatever
it
did
in
relation
to
trash
merely
by
the
fact
that
this
contractor
was
saying
critical
things
about
them
in
relation
to
trash
at
open
meetings
and
all
sorts
of
things.
why
were
they
rendered
less
able
to
function?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
regardless
of
whose
trash
he
was
hauling,
how
was
the
county
rendered
less
able
to
function
in
doing
the
things
that
it
did
by
virtue
of
this
criticism?
in
other
words,
i'm
saying
how
do
you
create
a
parallel
between
this
situation
and
pickering,
if
you're
going
to
argue
for
a
balancing
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
we
just
arguing
about
facts
in
this
case?
in
other
words,
the
county
is
simply
saying,
we
didn't
terminate
the
contract
because
of
all
the
nasty
things
he
was
saying,
we
terminated
the
contract
because
we
didn't
need
a
contract
any
more.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
if
that's
not
what
the
case
is
about,
let's
assume
that
the
speech
was
at
least
in
some
respect
a
factor
in
the
county's
decision.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
did
the
remarks
that
he
made
make
it
difficult
for
the
county
to
function?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
the
question
is,
how
does
it
make
it
hard
for
the
county
to
function?
what's
the
county's
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you're
saying
there
should
be
no
recognition
of
a
first
amendment
right
because
first
amendment
litigation
is
difficult
and
troublesome?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
do,
too,
but
i--
[laughter]
may
i
just
ask
you
this,
is
it
your
view
that
because
first
amendment
litigation
is
expensive
for
the
county,
they
have
to
prove
their
motive
was
something
other
than
retaliation
for
the
speech,
but
what
if
they
wanted
to
have
a
policy
that
would
remove
the
fact
issue
and
they
just
published
an
announced
policy,
we
will
not
do
business
with
any
trash
haulers
who
criticize
members
of
the
county
board?
if
they
were
very
candid
about
their
feelings,
we
don't
want
to
do
business
with
people
who
criticize
us,
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
that
argument
apply
to
any
decision
that
the
government
might
make
with
respect
to
any
citizen
on
any
subject?
why
should
there
be...
in
effect,
on
that
argument,
why
should
we
conclude
that
there
would
be
no
right,
in
effect,
to
criticize
the
government,
that
the
government
would
be
able
to
take
retaliatory
action
so
long
as
it
had
an
objective
basis
for
taking
the
original
action
that
the
individual
criticized?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
your
argument
in
effect
sort
of
read
the
first
amendment
sort
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--out
of
the
system?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
want
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
citizen
and
the
contractor,
you've
got
to
start
at
least
by
identifying
an
interest
on
the
part
of
the
government
which
would
justify,
at
least
arguably
justify
drawing
that
distinction,
and
the
only
interest
that
i've
heard
in
the
course
of
this
argument
is
an
interest
in
avoiding
litigation.
is
there
any
other
government
interest,
when
the
government
is
dealing
with
an
independent
contractor,
and
i'm
assuming
in
my
question
that
it's
not
an
independent
contractor
who
in
effect
is
performing
an
employee's
function
with
an
employee's
relationship
in
fact,
i'm
talking
about
a
real
independent
contractor
like
this
one,
is
there
any
government
interest
other
than
avoiding
litigation
which
is
the
basis,
in
your
view,
for
distinguishing
contractors
and
employees
and
citizens?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
does
it
affect
them
other
than
making
them
feel
bad
and
subjecting
them
to
a
heightened
scrutiny
by
people
who
say,
gosh,
these
criticisms
may
be
true?
how
is
the
government
otherwise
affected?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
they
might
have
to
litigate.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying,
then,
i
think,
that
when
the
independent
contractor
is
not
functionally
like
an
employee
in
the
office
that
the
only
real
issue
is
whether
the
contractor
is
performing
the
contract
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
it's
not,
they
can
fire
him
for
nonperformance,
and
if
he
is,
that's
the
end
of
the
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
government...
and
i
think
this
is
the
direction
justice
kennedy
was
going
in.
what
if
the
government
says,
look,
people
who
are
having
their
garbage
picked
up
do
not
want
to
have
to
listen
to
political
harangues
from
you.
don't
talk
about
politics
while
you're
picking
up
the
garbage.
is
that
a
first
amendment
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case,
that
is
for
the...
even
if...
let's
add
another
term
to
the
contract.
don't
talk
to
them
about
politics
when
you're
picking
up
the
garbage,
but
when
you're
on
your
own
time,
say
anything
you
want
to.
publish
in
the
press,
write
letters,
hire
loudspeakers,
sandwich
boards,
everything.
still
a
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
can
win
this
case,
or
your
side
can
win
this
case
on
a
much
narrower
ground,
can't
it,
because
we're
not
talking...
as
i
understand
it,
we're
not
talking
here
about
the
contractor's
speech
in
the
course
of
performance,
we're
talking
about
the
contractor's
speech,
as
it
were,
on
the
contractor's
own
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
can
leave
some
of
these
difficult
questions
for
another
day
and
still,
in
theory,
prevail,
leaving
them
open,
can't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
rule
would
be
that
what
the
contractor
does
on
his
own
time
is
protected
so
long
as
it
does
not,
in
fact,
impede
the
performance
of
the
contract,
is
that...
would
that
be
the
rule
that
you
would
argue
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
think
the
pickering
rule
applies
to
this...
to
independent
contractors?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
if
i
may
ask,
in
a
case
like
this
case,
if
i
understand
you,
you're
really
not
arguing
that
there
should
be
a
balancing
test.
you're
saying
the
test
should
be,
can
they
perform
the
contract
and
still
say
these
things?
if
the
answer
is
yes,
they
cannot
be
penalized.
if
the
answer
is
no,
they
can
be.
