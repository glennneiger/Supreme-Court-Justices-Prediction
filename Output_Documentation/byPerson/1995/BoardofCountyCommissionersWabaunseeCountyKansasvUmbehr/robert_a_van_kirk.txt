mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
is
about
whether
the
first
amendment
protects
independent
contractors
from
retaliation
based
solely
on
the
expression
of
viewpoints
dissenting
from
those
of
the
government
officials
in
power.
it
is
in
essence
about
whether
independent
contractors
forfeit
their
right
to
engage
in
public
debate
and
to
criticize
government
officials
when
they
contract
with
governmental
entities.
the
petitioners
have
raised
a
host
of
contentions
in
their
briefs.
i'd
like
to
focus
on
what
i
think
are
the
three
central
questions
presented
by
this
litigation.
first,
a
consistent
line
of
cases
from
this
court,
spanning
over
40
years,
clearly
support
the
tenth
circuit's
conclusion
that
there
is
no
blanket
exception
to
the
first
amendment
for
independent
contractors,
and
that
they,
like
all
citizens,
are
entitled
to
protection
under
the
first
amendment
from
official
retaliation
for
their
speech.
second,
because
the
government's
interest
in
regulating
the
speech
of
independent
contractors
is
so
narrow
and
limited,
their
speech
should
be
subject
to
a
heightened
form--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--on
the
first
point
there
actually
is
no
principal
case,
it
is
a
entire
string
of
unconstitutional
condition
cases
that
this
court--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--lefkowitz
v.
turley,
your
honor,
in
which
in
the
fifth
amendment
context
this
court
recognized
that
the
government
could
not
ask
the
independent
contractor
to
forfeit
their
right
against
self
incrimination
as
a--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--there--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--it
depends
on
if
you
view
the
employment
cases
involving
contracts
as
independent
contractors.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
the
answer--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--the
answer
is
no
in
this
specific
context,
so
what
it
is,
it
is
the
application
of
well
established
principles
to
the
unconstitutional
condition
doctrine
to
an
actual
situation
that
is
marginally
different
than
the
situations
that
this
court
has
encountered
previously.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
i
think
because
the
contractual
relationship
is
what
is
being
terminated,
and
the
court...
there
is
some
question
in
the
court's
jurisprudence
about
how
to
address
the
public
employment
cases
and
whether
or
not
that
is
use
of
the
employment
as
punishment
for
speech
and
viewpoint
discrimination.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
i
think
so.
there
are
a
number
of...
each
of
the
court's
employment
cases
do
refer
to
this
use
of
the
job
benefit
as
a
condition
being
placed
on
individuals'
speech,
so
it
is
talked
about
in
the
context
of
unconstitutional
issues.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
i
think
that
is
as
well,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that
the
two
theories
are
necessarily
dissimilar.
there
are
situations
in
which
the
government,
in
its
different
capacities,
does
have
an
interest
in
regulating
speech.
we
don't
see
any
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
it...
what
we
have--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--what
we
have
suggested
is
that
the
court--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--what
we
have
suggested,
the
court
need
not
in
this
case
address
whether
or
not
there
is
a
similar
private
speech
issue.
the
speech
in
this
case,
and
i
think
petitioners
acknowledge,
is
on
core
matters
of
public
concern.
in
that
situation,
the
court
may
wish
to,
if
it
is
presented
with
a
situation
like
that,
adopt
a
similar
restriction
as
involving
the
public
employment
context--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--we
recognize
that
this
case
is
on
core
matters
of
public
concern.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
it
does...
the
analysis
does
depend
on
whether
or
not
we
are...
at
least
as
is
articulated
in
the
employment
context,
on
whether
or
not
the
court
is
dealing--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--no,
it
would
not,
your
honor,
as
givhan
suggests,
that--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--private
speech
is
equally
as
protected.
i
think
justice
scalia's
point
goes
to
whether
or
not
simply
a
complaint
about
the
manner
in
which
the
contract
is
being
administered,
or
complaints
about
the
nature
of
the
contractual
relationship
itself,
whether
that
would
anidate
a
person--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--i
have
not
take
the
time
to
peruse--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--no.
i
think
what
is
a
good
demonstration,
however,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
these
claims
are
currently
available,
as
we
suggest,
in
a
number
of
circuits,
and
there
still
is
not
a
flood
of
litigation,
and
i
think
what
actually
occurs,
independent
contractors
generally
are
afraid
of
antagonizing
what
is
not
only
the
sovereign
but
their
business
partners,
and
as
a
result
there
is
some
limitation
on
their
willingness
to
bring
suit.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
there
is
some
chilling.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
yes,
i
think
that's
very
true.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
they
typically
attempt
to
avoid
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
we
think
not
a
pickering
type
balance
because
it
does
not...
it
underprotects
speech
in
this
particular
context.
each
of
this
court's--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--i
think
that
that's
true,
in
those
situations
where
we're
dealing
with
independent
contractors
that
are
essentially
the
equivalent
of
an
employee,
there
is
no
reason--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--i
would
suggest
there
is
a
difference
between
traditional
public
function
and
the
degree
to
which
an
employee
or
an
individual
is
incorporated
within
the
government's
own
operations,
the
degree
of
interference
that
their
speech
may
cause.
there's
some
nexus
or
connection
between
the
speech
and
the
potential
disruption.
here,
we
have
a
very
thin,
narrow
line
affecting
the
contractor--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--i
think
that
the
government
has
some
interest
in
considering
the
speech
of
independent
contractors.
it
has
a
much
less
interest,
in
response
to
your
question
about
whether
pickering
provides
the
appropriate
analysis,
in
situations
like
this.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
i
think
they
would
have
difficulty
making
that...
putting
that
restriction
on
the
contractor.
as
long
as
the
contractor
is
not
viewed...
i
mean,
in
this
case,
for
example,
mr.
umbehr's
trucks
clearly
say,
solid
waste
systems,
on
the
side
of
them.
the
individual
may
know
that
government
has
hired
the
contractor,
but
it's
not
going
to
impute
the
speech
to
the
government.
it's
not
going
to
view
the
individual
as
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
government.
now,
the
government
may
say,
you're
slowing
down,
you're
not
going
fast
enough
in
picking
up
trash.
we
don't
care
what
it
is
that
you
do
on
your
own
time,
we
want
you
to
finish
this
schedule.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
yes,
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
precisely.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
you
are...
the
individuals
are--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--they're
not--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--yes,
i
think
that
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
yes.
now,
if
you're...
let
me
pose
a
different--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--when
the
government--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--when
the
government
is
speaking,
in
fact
hiring
others
to
speak
on
its
behalf,
it
does
have
far
greater
rights
to
control
speech.
if
it's
hiring
a
racial
sensitivity
trainer,
and
it
has
the
same
applicants
that
you
describe,
somebody
with
no
racial
bias
and
an
individual
who,
in
fact,
is
well
known
in
the
community
as
being
racially
intolerant,
they,
in
that
situation,
can
say,
even
if
the
racially...
excuse
me,
the
racially
intolerant
individual
promises
to
adhere
to
the
text
of
the
script
that
they
provide,
they
can
say,
we're
sorry,
we
are
attempting
to
communicate
a
message
of
tolerance.
your
notoriety
in
the
community
is
simply
too
great,
because
we,
as
the
government,
are
the
speaker.
there's
a
difference
between
when
the
government
is
itself
endorsing
a
message,
attempting
to
communicate
a
message--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--even
speech
it
abhors,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
this
court
has
suggested
in
various
contexts,
wygant
being
one
of
them,
that
there
may
be
a
difference
in
the
equal
protection
context,
and
certainly
that's
the
case
here.
we
believe
we
have
the
strongest
interest.
i
am
not
sure
that
the
government
has
any
more
compelling
interest
in
regulating
speech
when
it
is
considering--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--bids
as
opposed
to
terminating
an
existing
contractor.
i
think
it's
a
stronger
case,
but
i
don't
think
it's
constitutionally
dispositive.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
certainly,
your
honor.
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
that
type
of
interest,
that
the
potential
for
abuse,
is
enough
to
completely
destroy--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--pickering
is
concerned,
and
all
of
this
court's
first
amendment
jurisprudence
is
concerned
with
the
government's
ability
to
function,
and
to
demonstrate
interests
when
it
has
interests,
but
the
interests
have
to
be
in
regulating
speech,
not
in
some
generalized
concern
about
abuse.
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
court...
with
any
opinion
from
this
court,
nor
have
i
seen
it
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
that
would
suggest
that
it
is
a
cognizable
part
of
the
constitutional
analysis
to
consider
whether
or
not
there
are
too
many
people
who
may
be...
may
have
a--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--i
do
not
think
that...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
your--
that's
the
kind
of
thing
he's
thinking
about,
and
that's
what
might
lead
to
a
connick
standard,
or
a
pickering
standard,
and...
or
some
other
standard,
and
it's
that
kind
of
problem
that
i'd
like
to
see
addressed.
this
isn't
an
employment
case.
that
doesn't
mean
it's
easier
than
an
employment
case.
it
does
suggest,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
that
in
the
employment
context
what
the
court
recognized
in
fashioning
pickering
and
connick
was
the
government's
interest
in
regulating
speech
when
speech
is
disruptive,
not
the
possibility
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
federal
and
state
employees
may
bring
frivolous
claims.
they
may,
but
what
we
have
always
done
in
our
system
is
leave
that
to
the
trier
of
fact,
and
that's
what
i
understand
the
petitioners
to
be
attempting
to
avoid,
is
to
allow
a
trier
of
fact
to
determine
whether
or
not
their
motivation
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--in
terms...
i
am
suggesting
an
approach
that
takes
into
account
what
functional
position
the
independent
contractor
is
in
in
any
particular
circumstance,
and
what
i'm
also
suggesting
is
that
viewpoint
based
discrimination,
as
justice
kennedy
has
pointed
out,
the
constitutional
baseline
for
that
type
of
effort
to
punish
disfavored
views
is
strict
scrutiny,
and
there
has
to
be
some
government
interest
sufficient
to
move
us
away
from
that
baseline.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
i
concede
that
in
that
situation
where
the
government
says,
we
need
to
be
able
to
rely
on
a
confidential
relationship
with
this
independent
contractor
in
the
same
way
that
we
do
with
an
employee,
that
that
may
be
perfectly
permissible
for
in
that
situation
the
court
to--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--again,
we
don't
believe
this
case
presents
occasion
to
address
that,
but
it
does...
the
court's
opinions
suggest
that
that
type
of
issue
would
present
a
situation
that
is
not
of
constitutional
magnitude.
if
it
is
simply
a
personal
dispute
with
the
contracting
agency
about
the
terms
of
the
contract,
rather
than
something
that
the
general
public
might
be
concerned
about,
the
court
may
wish
to
indicate
that
the
same
concerns
that
animated
pickering
to
exclude
speech
on
matters
of
purely
private
concern
is
also
excluded,
but
not
addressing
that
situation.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
in
addressing
this
situation
in
the
courts
of
appeals
under
pickering,
plaintiffs
often
attempt
to
say
anything
that
has
to
do
with
the
government,
government
function
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
it's
typically
an
unsuccessful
argument.
it
is
available
to
them--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--because--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--i
have
suggested
that
in
terms
of
addressing
general
first
amendment
jurisprudence
that
that
ought
not
to
be
the
rule
for
an
entire
class
of
individuals,
that
you
would
not
wipe
out
first
amendment
protection
for
core
matters
of
public
concern
based
on
considerations
of
administrative
efficiency.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
they
may,
your
honor.
each
situation
is
going
to
involve--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--it
may...
there
is
a
balancing
that
goes
on
here,
there's
no
question.
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
but
that's
the
central
question
that's
presented,
is
do
we
even
get
to
that
point?
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
no,
it
may
not,
your
honor.
to
the
same
extent
they
may
not
make
that--
mr.
robert
a.
van
kirk
--that
essentially
would
swallow
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine,
your
honor.
it
would
suggest
as
long
as
we
are
providing
you
with
some
benefit,
here
the
trash
contracts,
we
can
dictate
what
you
say,
and
that's,
i
would
suggest
is
inconsistent
with
the
approach
this
court
has
taken.
