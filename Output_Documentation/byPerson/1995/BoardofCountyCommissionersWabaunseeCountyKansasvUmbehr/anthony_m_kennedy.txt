is
it
necessary
for
us
to
talk
about
unconstitutional
conditions?
why
isn't
this
just
a
state
effort
to
censor
speech,
and
void
for
that
reason,
and
why
do
we
have
to
talk
about
unconstitutional
conditions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
government
does
not
have
an
interest
in
censoring
or
suppressing
any
ideas
except
in
very,
very
narrow
circumstances,
and
why
isn't
that
dispositive
of
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel,
suppose
that
a
municipality
owned
a
number
of
garbage
trucks,
that
it
owned
and
it
used
to
operate
with
its
own
employees.
it
then
switches.
it
wants
independent
contractors
to
come
in
and
run
the
trucks.
can
it
tell
these
independent
contractors,
since
you're
using
our
trucks,
we
do
not
want
you
to
discuss
matters
of
pubic
concern
or
politics,
just
pick
up
the
garbage,
and
that's
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
it
has
given
to
these
contractors
substantial
government
assets
to
use
in
order
to
circulate
throughout
the
community?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
aren't
they
also
in
a
unique
position
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
gave,
and
like
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
with
the
contract
guards?
aren't
they
in
a
unique
position,
based
upon
their
contract
with
the
government,
their
use
of
government
assets
and
government
payments,
to
have
access
to
the
community
which
other
people
do
not
have?
why
does
the
government
have
to
subsidize
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they
say,
we
don't
want
you
discussing
any
matters
of
public
concern
because
you
have
a
special
privilege,
going
in
to
homes,
that
we
are
giving
you,
and
we
do
not
want
you
to
exercise
that
on
our
behalf?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i
will
stipulate
that
out
of
the
hypothetical.
