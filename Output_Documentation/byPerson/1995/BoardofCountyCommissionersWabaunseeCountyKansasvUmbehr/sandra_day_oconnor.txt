justice

o'connor
mr.
patterson,
it's
not
a
case
involving
any
issue
of
political
patronage,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
free
speech
case--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
context
of
an
independent
contractor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
with
the
county.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
patterson,
suppose
it
were
an
employee
of
the
county
who
wanted
to
assert
free
speech
rights
and
be
critical
of
how
the
county
used
county
equipment
for
private
purposes
or
something,
now,
in
that
situation
as
well,
the
county
would
be
faced
with
the
threat
and
expense
of
litigation,
would
it
not,
same
burden
on
the
county
as
you
assert
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
what
result
in
the
employees'
situation?
do
we
protect
the
employees'
speech
on
matters
of
public
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
but
you
say
it
has
to
be
different
for
every
independent
contractor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
dealing
here
with
a
contract
termination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
can
say
the
same
here
about
the
independent
contractor.
sure,
you
may
have
to
defend
one
lawsuit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
had
an
agreement
that
said
it
was
terminable
by
either
party
at
will.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
60
days'
notice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
impaired,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
only
because
the
county
didn't
provide
the
proper
notice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
on
any
given
year,
if
the
county
had
applied...
had
followed
the
procedure
in
the
contract
for
giving
notice,
it
could
have
done
so,
could
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
patterson,
this
case
has
been
remanded
for
trial,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
apply
a
pickering
balance
type
test--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
county
can
offer
its
so
called
mount
healthy
defense
saying
we
would
have
terminated
the
contract
anyway--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
other
reasons,
so
that's
open
on
remand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
patterson--
--well,
what
test
should
be
employed,
then,
if
it
isn't
a
pickering
balance
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
in
dealing
with
claims
of
this
kind,
should
the
courts
apply
a
pickering
type
balance
such
as
we
would
if
it
were
a
government
employee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
not
necessarily.
we're
living
in
an
age
where
government
is
trying
to
do
more
and
more
government
functions
by
way
of
private
contracting,
and
nonetheless
perform
services
that
government
traditionally
performs,
and
when
they
contract
with
private
people
to
perform
those
services,
why
shouldn't
the
interest
be
very
much
like
that
of
an
employee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
in
connection
with
trash
hauling
we
might
think
that
that
was
a
traditional
public
function.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
if
somebody
comes
around
and
picks
up
my
trash
at
home,
i'm
going
to
assume
it's
some
kind
of
government
service
being
provided,
so
government
might
have
a
real
reason
to
treat
even
a
private
contractor
in
that
context
like
an
employee.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
a
government
contract
to
provide
security
guard
services
in
a
public
housing
project,
do
you
think
the
government
can
discharge
the
contractor
because
the
people
are
members
of
the
nation
of
islam,
for
that
reason?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
test
do
we
employ?
do
we
use
a
pickering
balance
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
test
are
we
employing
here,
a
pickering
balance
test,
is
that
what
you're
arguing
for?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
pickering
type
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
the
opinion
to
announce
in
board
of
county
commissioners,
wabaunsee
county,
kansas
versus
umbehr,
no.
94-1654.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
first
amendment
protects
independent
contractors
from
the
termination
of
at-will
government
contracts
in
retaliation
for
the
exercise
of
the
contractor’s
right
of
free
speech.
as
of
1991,
the
respondent
keen
umbehr
had
been
the
exclusive
provider
of
solid
waste
disposal
services
for
wabaunsee
county
for
ten
years.
a
contract
was
subject
to
annual
renewal
which
occurred
automatically
unless
either
party
gave
notice
of
non-renewal.
during
that
period,
he
had
been
an
outspoken
critic
of
the
petitioner,
the
board
of
county
commissioners
at
meetings
and
in
local
newspapers.
umbehr
had
accused
the
board
of
various
forms
of
mismanagement
and
at
some
violations
of
state
law.
umbehr’s
complaint
alleges
that
in
1991,
the
board
gave
him
notice
of
non-renewal
and
terminated
its
commercial
relationship
with
it
in
retaliation
for
that
criticism.
umbehr
sued
the
board
under
42
u.s.
code
section
1983
asserting
a
violation
of
its
first
amendment
right
of
freedom
of
speech.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
board
on
the
basis
that
the
first
amendment
affords
no
protection
against
termination
of
contracts
with
independent
contractors.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded.
it
held
first
that
independent
government
contractors
are
protected
from
termination
of
the
contract
in
retaliation
for
their
speech
on
matters
of
public
concern
just
as
government
employees
would
be,
and
second
that
the
limits
on
that
protection
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
context
of
government
employment
contracts
is
applicable
to
contractors
as
well.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
tenth
circuit’s
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
apply
the
analysis
of
our
government
employee
precedence
to
determine
the
rights
of
independent
government
contractors.
both
parties
argued
that
independent
contractors
are
different
from
employee
in
relevant
respects.
umbehr
argues
that
because
independent
contactors
such
as
himself
typically
do
not
work
as
closely
with
government
personnel
as
to
government
employees
and
are
not
as
closely
associated
with
the
government.
that
the
government’s
interests
contractor
cases
are
attenuated
and
should
receive
closer
scrutiny
then
we
give
them
in
government
employment
contracts.
the
board
argues
that
contractors
are
typically
less
dependent
on
the
government
and
less
subject
to
government
control
sort
of
termination
and
should
therefore
enjoy
less
protection
on
employees.
these
arguments
are
not
without
force
but
they
cut
those
ways
and
we
think
the
parties'
points
are
better
accommodate
within
our
traditional
analysis
which
allows
for
a
balancing
of
the
interest
of
the
government
and
the
contractor
rather
than
by
a
white
line
distinction
between
independent
contractors
and
employees.
we
therefore
apply
with
appropriate
modifications
the
criteria
for
liability
announced
in
our
government
employment
precedents
such
as
pickering
versus
board
of
education,
mt.
healthy
city
board
of
education
versus
doyle,
connick
versus
myers,
and
waters
versus
churchill.
we
hold
independent
contractors
are
constitutionally
protected
from
termination
of
their
commercial
relationships
with
the
government
in
retaliation
for
their
exercise
of
first
amendment
right
of
free
speech.
to
prevail,
i
am
very
much
sure
that
the
board’s
decision
to
terminate
him
or
was
motivated
by
his
speech
on
the
matter
of
public
concern.
if
he
can
do
so,
the
board
will
have
a
valid
defense
if
it
can
show
via
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
then
in
light
of
their
knowledge
perceptions
and
policies
at
the
time
of
the
termination,
the
board
members
would
have
terminated
him
regardless
of
his
speech.
the
board
will
also
prevail
if
it
can
show
that
the
county’s
legitimate
interest
as
contractor,
differentially
viewed,
outweigh
the
free
speech
interest
of
the
contractor
at
issue.
we
thus
affirm
the
judgment
at
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
joined
all
but
part
2-b1
of
the
opinion
of
the
court;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
