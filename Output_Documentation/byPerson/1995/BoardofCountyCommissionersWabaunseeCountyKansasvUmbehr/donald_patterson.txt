mr.
donald
r.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
is
a
first
amendment
case.
it
involves
the
interest
and
the
responsibility
of
local
government
in
making
the
decisions
in
the
course
of
governing
and
in
the
course
of
delivering
government
services
that
have
an
economic
impact
on
contractors.
it
also
involves
the
interest
of
a
contractor
who
engages
in
what
i
will
refer
to
as
protected
activity,
activity
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
for
convenience
i'd
like
to
refer
to
that
as
a
local
contractor,
if
i
may.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no,
it
is
not.
we
can
rule
that
out.
this
is
not
a
patronage
case.
in
fact,
i
think
you
could
almost
say
it's
the
opposite.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
exactly.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
exactly.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
think
they
were.
the
question
i
was
asked
was
whether
or
not
this
was
a
patronage
case,
and
it's
not.
it
is
a
free
speech
case.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
they
are
a
form
of
first
amendment
case,
and
probably
not.
they
are
first
amendment
cases--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--it
depends
upon
how
the
contour
of
the
first
amendment
right
is
defined
in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
first
amendment,
which
uses
the
word,
abridging.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
to
me,
it
comes
right
down
to
that.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
is
not,
and
i
believe
that
probably
is
the
answer
to
the
question
over
here,
to
justice
scalia's
question.
this
doesn't
involve
a
question
of
party
loyalty,
anybody's
political
philosophy.
it
doesn't.
the
first
amendment
rights
that
were
exercised
were
on
other
subjects,
that's
all.
now,
i
think
that
the
balance
of
these
interests
is
required
by
the
fact
that
government,
local
government
in
particular,
in
the
course
of
making
government
decisions
and
delivering
government
services,
requires
them
to
make
decisions
that
have
an
economic
impact
on
contractors
and
potential
contractors.
when
the
contractor
who
exercises
first
amendment
rights
is
adversely
affected
by
a
decision
that
gives
him
the
potential
of
saying,
foul,
you
have
harmed
me,
and
it
is
retaliatory
against
me,
how
is
that
conflict
to
be
resolved?
we
suggest
that
the
term
of
bridging
really
has
two
different
components.
one,
of
course,
is
the
interest
of
government.
to
what
extent,
and
how
is
its
ability
to
perform
the
functions
that
is
expected
of
it
by
the
people
who
voted
them
there
to
continue
if
they
have
to
live
under
the
threat
of
intent
determination,
motive
determination
litigation,
and
the
question
is,
can
it?
the
second
component,
i
think,
is
the
end
result
of
government
action
on
the
person
who
exercises
his
first
amendment
rights.
is
it
an
abridgement
if
he
is
left
in
a
position
that
is
no
different
and
equal
to
the
position
of
his
comparators
in
similar
situations?
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
all
right.
the
core
question
is
the
same.
it's
the
ability--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--yes,
you
do.
you
do.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--the
core
interest
of
government
is
essentially
the
same,
the
ability
to
continue
its
services.
the
mechanics
by
which
that
are
achieved
i
think
are
different
because
of
the
different
legal
relationship
and
the
different
economic
relationship
between
contractors
and
government
and
employees
and
the
government.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
okay.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
is,
and
in...
that's
particularly
true
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
could
be.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
think
that
it's
a
question
of
degree,
and
i
believe
this
court
has
previously
said
that
degrees--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i'm
about
to
address
that.
i
think
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
he
has
been
harmed
as
compared
with
other
equally
situated
comparators.
the
employee
who
is
shut
out,
or
not
given
the
job
for
which
he
applies,
sure,
he's
harmed,
as
compared
with
other
employees,
but
in
this
case,
what
happened?
this
contractor...
and
you
have
to
go
back
into
the
facts
of
the
case.
this
was
essentially
a
contract
between
mr.
umbehr
and
six
cities,
that's
all.
under
this
contract
he
hauled
no
trash
for
the
county.
the
county
paid
him
nothing.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no.
my
point
is
that
in
this
second
component
of
abridgement,
the
contractor
has
to
be
left
in
a
position
that
is
less
than
the
position
of
his
silent
comparators,
and
in
this
case
he
was
not.
his
basic
complaint
was
that
the
playing
field
on
which
he
had
to
compete
with
other
contractors
for
the
same
business
was
leveled.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no.
that...
those
were
not
the
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
they--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--they
terminated
it.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
it
would
have.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
would
have.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
was,
because
what
the
readjustment
that
occurred
was
that
he
lost
his
competitive
edge
that
he
had
over
other
equally
situated
contractors.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
the
specific
answer
to
your
question
is
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
hauling
trash,
because
under
this
contract
mr.
umbehr
hauled
no
county
trash
and
the
county
paid
him
nothing--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--it
impaired
their
ability
to
terminate
what
they
perceived
was
a
contractual
relationship
that
was
no
longer
needed.
it
took
up
a
lot
of
the
county's
time.
they
received
no
benefit
from
it.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no.
that
gets
into
the
issue
of
motive
determination,
which
admittedly
is
a
fact
issue
in
the
event
this
is
ever--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--for
here
we
assume
that.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
if
the
county
made
the
decision
that
the
service
they
were
providing...
that
is,
getting
mr.
umbehr
and
the
six
cities
together
on
a
contract
was
no
longer
needed,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
first
amendment
empowers
the
contractor
who
uses
his
first
amendment
rights,
to
continue
that
practice
even
though
it's
not--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--okay,
it
makes
it
harder
for
the
county
to
function
because
of
the
threat
and
expense
of
motive
determination--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--no,
i
think
that
would
be
begging
the
question.
i
think
it's
a
question--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
think
that
would
come
very
close
to
a
prior
restraint,
and
my
answer
to
that
would
be
probably
not.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that's
true.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
this.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
how
the
contours
of
the
first
amendment
right
are
going
to
be
defined
in
terms
of
that
word,
abridging.
now,
that's
the
first
amendment
word.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
think
that's
a
different
issue.
that's...
that
goes
to
the
component
of
abridging
that
deals
with
the
interest
of
the
contractor.
my
point
there
simply
was
that--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well,
except
that
they...
that
is
another
question.
if
the
contractor
is
not
harmed,
it's
our
contention
that
he
has--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--no,
i
think
that
crosses
up
the
facts
of
the
case.
what
was
occurring
was--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
am.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
am.
i
think--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that's
true.
i
think--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well,
you
do
under
pickering,
of
course.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
think
the
difference
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
spectra
of
government
decisions
that
can
impact
contractors
adversely
is
much
greater
and
much
more
numerous
than
it
is
in
dealing
with
an
employee,
and
secondly,
i
think
the--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--okay.
with...
in
the
employment
situation,
the
employee
speaks
out
on
some
subject
of
concern
but
how,
in
effect,
does
that
impact
the
employer?
sure,
he
may
have
to
defend
one
lawsuit,
but
does
he--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--no.
i
think
that
the
likelihood
and
the
number
of
lawsuits
with
which
they
are
threatened
is
much
more
numerous
if
the
right
of
free
speech
is
so
defined,
and
the
contour
is
so
defined.
for
example,
in
this
case,
should
the
contractor
be
empowered
by
his
threat
to
perpetuate
a
service
that
is
perceived
as
no
longer
needed?
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
all
right...
no.
no,
not
quite
at
will,
60
days'
notice
prior--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--sixty
days'
notice
prior
to
april
7
in
any
given
year.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no,
that
was...
well,
it
was,
yes,
because
that's
exactly
what
they
did.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
that
was--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that's
exactly
what
it
did
in
1991,
and
that's
what
brought
about
the
suit.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i...
we
know
why
he
lost
the
other
city.
he
was
underbid
by
another
contractor,
who
was
silent.
the
question
is--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--does
the
first
amendment
empower
him
to
be
free
of
that
competition?
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
as
i
perceive
it,
the
question
here
is
how
and
to
what
extent
the
contour
of
first
amendment
right
really
is
on
the
part
of
a
contractor
in
dealing
with
government
with
which
he
seeks...
with
which
he
seeks
to
contract.
now,
the
question
really
is
whether
or
not
the
contractor,
who
by
speaking
out
on
matters
of
public
concern,
can
define
his
own
benefit
for
which,
if
he
is
denied,
he
has
the
right
to
go
to
government
and
say,
pay
me
my
demand
or
pay
my
damages,
take
your
choice.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
all
right.
that
would
be
a
reason.
that
would
be
a
reason,
and
what
we
suggest
is
that
the
government
in
making
decisions
should
be
free
of
that
kind
of
threat
of
motive
determination
litigation
if
there
is
objectively
legitimate
government
reason
for
making
the
decision
they
made.
now,
that's--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well,
there
again,
i
think--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
contour
of
the
first
amendment
right
of
the
ordinary
citizen
who
has
no
contractual
right
with
the
government
is
the
same
as
the
contour
of
the
first
amendment
right
of
the
contractor
who
does
wish
to
do
business
with
the
government.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes.
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
that
ought
to
be
shielded
from
that
kind
of
interference.
for
example,
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
continue
a
service
that
they
perceive
is
no
longer
needed.
a
decision
to
no
longer
perform
this
service
by
a
contractor,
but
do
it
by
employees.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
all
right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
all
right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
think
you'd
have
to
inquire
why
were
they
terminated?
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
difference,
as
long
as
there
is
a
legitimate,
objectively
legitimate
government
reason
for
doing
whatever
they
did.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
in
that
context
yes,
you
probably
would,
but
you've
got
to
assume
the
absence
of
a
legitimate,
or
an
objectively
legitimate
government
reason
for
doing
what
they
did.
they
did
it
solely
because
of
an
impermissible
reason,
yes.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
all
right.
my
question,
or
my
contention,
or
our
contention
is
that
there
is...
there
ought
to
be
some
kind
of
an
interest
on
the
part
of
government
to
perform
its
functions
that
to
a
degree
is
free
and
clear
of
this
kind
of
threat.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
oh,
i
think
the
threat
to
government
is
different
in
a
contractor
situation
than
it
is
in
an
employee
situation,
and
you
hit
upon
the
exact
difference,
and
that
is,
the
employee
can
at
least
create
the
appearance
of
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
employs
him.
that
isn't
true
of
the
contractor,
but
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well,
again,
i
would
disagree.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
the
expense
of
litigation
impairs
their
ability
to
make
an
objective
decision
of
what's
best
for
the
voters.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
they're
all
prohibited,
that's
true.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--of
course
it
is,
and
i
would
go
right
back
to
the
word
of
bridging.
it's
a
question
of
how
the
contour
of
that
right
is
to
be
defined.
i
suspect
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
was
remanded
for
reconsideration
under
pickering,
if
i
recall
the
exact
language.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that...
had
we
not
been
here,
that's
where
we
would
be.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
think
that
the
differences
between
contractors
and
employers,
both
the
economic
difference
and
the
legal
difference,
requires
a
different
kind
of
a
contour
drawing
of
what
those
interests
between
government
and
the
contractor
are.
for
example--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well,
it
is
a
balancing
test,
but
i
think
the
factors
that
must
be
considered
are
different.
the
reason
is
that
a
contractor
is
usually
in
a
position,
a
bargaining
position
with
his
superior.
he
can
negotiate
in
the
contract
some
of
his
own
protections.
secondly,
government
controls
only
the
result
with
the
contractor.
the
government
cannot
control
what
the
employees
do
or
the
means
of
accomplishment.
they
can
control
only
the
result.
but
that
also
brings
into
question
whether
or
not
the
contractor
can
compel
a
continuation
of
a
result
that
the
government
officials
no
longer
want.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no.
that's
not
what
i'm
saying
at
all.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i'm
sorry.
that's
not
what
i'm
defending
at
all.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no.
the
point
i
am
defending--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--our
contention
is--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--the
question...
the
question
is
whether
or
not,
if
government
does
have
a
legitimate,
objectively
legitimate
reason
for
terminating
a
contractual
relationship,
should
they
be
afraid
to
do
it.
