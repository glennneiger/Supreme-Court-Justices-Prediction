justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one
is
just
one
that
you
have
to
try
out
the
facts
to
find
out
what
the
real
motive
is
in
this
case,
and
the
one
i
hypothesized,
we
all
know
what
the
motive
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
see,
they've
alleged
the
motive
similar
to
the
one
i
describe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
seems
to
me
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
we
have
to
assume
those
allegations
are
true,
so
i'm
not
sure
there's
a
distinction
between
my
case
and
this
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
could
i
just
ask
you
this
supposing
you
have
three
contractors,
one
of
whom
makes
a
lot
of
speeches,
like
this
gentlemen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
is
an
irish
catholic,
and
a
third
one
is
a
negro.
justice
john
paul
stevens
each
one
of
them
says
he
was
terminated
because...
for
a
racial
reason,
or
a
religious
reason,
or
a
free
speech
reason.
each
one
of
them
raises
the
question
of
proving
motive.
why
should
there
be
a
difference
in
your
duty
to
have
to
prove
motive
if
you
have
an
independent
reason
or
you
don't
in
the
three
difference
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
allege
because
i
was
a
member
of
a
religion
that
the
members
of
the
board
don't
like,
or
a
member
of
a
race
they
don't
like,
or
a
member
of
somebody
who
speaks
out
against
them.
why
is
there
a
difference
between
the
three
in
evaluating
the
burden
on
the
board
to
explain
it
had
a
legitimate
reason
rather
than
one
of
these
impermissible
reasons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there
is
not
an
objective
government
reason,
but
the
only
reason
anybody
can
figure
out
is
a
bad
reason
in
the
three
cases
i
put,
wouldn't
you
treat
them
all
alike?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
the
plaintiff
has
alleged,
and
says
he's
undertaken
the
task
of
proving
that.
if
he
can't
prove
it,
he
loses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt?
what
is
the
principal
case
that
you
rely
on
for
your
first
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
name
one
involving
a
government
contractor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
a
case
involving
a
government
contractor
and
the
first
amendment--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
this
wide
range
that
you
describe
so
categorically?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
one
involving--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
sales
executives
don't
normally
go
into
the
contracting
officer
and
call
him
all
sorts
of
bad
names?
no?
[laughter]
