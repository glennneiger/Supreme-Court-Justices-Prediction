mr.
patterson,
the
answer
that
you
just
gave,
it
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
what
you
said
earlier
about
the
level
playing
field,
because
if
the
government
had
this
policy
that
applied
equally
to
all
contractors,
if
you're
going
to
be
consistent
with
the
position
you
were
taking,
wouldn't
you
have
to
say,
well,
that's
okay,
because
they're
all
being
treated
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
this
contractor
isn't
harmed
in
your
view
then
no
other
question
is
relevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
he
wouldn't
be
harmed
whether
the
government
does
it
up
front
by
saying,
don't
talk
if
you
want
a
government
contract,
or
wait
until
the
contract
is
underway.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
my
concern.
are
we
talking
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
which
i
might
say
contractors
come
in
all
sizes
and
shapes,
some
are
very
much
like
employees,
some
are
very
distant
from
employees.
i
thought
that
you
were
drawing
a
contractor
line,
and
you
were
drawing
a
line
between
employees--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
contractors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
all
the
more
reason
for
the
government
to
tolerate
that
speech
because
it
doesn't
affect
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the
same
whether
it's
race
discrimination,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out...
in
every
one
of
those
cases
the
government
says
we
did
it
for
a
good
reason,
the
complaint
alleges
you
did
it
for
a
bad
reason,
and
if
you
have
conceded,
i
believe,
that
if
it's
race
discrimination,
sex
discrimination--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
speech
discrimination
isn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
seemed
to
be
the
position
you're
taking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
van
kirk,
one
thing
i
wanted
to
get
your
answer
on,
government
contractors
do
come
in
all
sizes
and
shapes.
some
are
very
close
to
employees,
some
are
distant.
maybe
some
are
really
akin
to
policymakers.
we
have
at
least
that
system
in
place.
why
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
go
beyond
that
when
there's
no
uniformity
in
what
government
contractors
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
policymaker
category
for
government
contractors
the
way
there
is
for
employees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
matters
of
public
concern,
as
distinguished
from
ordinary
gripe
and
grousing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sometimes
it
would.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's...
my
problem
with
your
position
is,
you
seem
to
be
arguing
for
a
case
by
case
position.
you're
not
arguing
for
something
higher
than
pickering
in
every
case,
but
in
some
cases.
is
that...
am
i
correct
in
understanding
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
courts
have
a
framework
that
they
know
they
can
deal
with,
but
you're
saying
there
can't
be
any
such
for
the
government
contractor.
it
has
to
be
one
case
at
a
time.
