mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
president
acted
within
his
statutory
and
constitutional
authority
when
he
promulgated
rule
for
courts
martial
1004
to
limit
the
circumstances
in
which
the
death
penalty,
when
otherwise
specifically
authorized
by
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
may
be
imposed.
if
the
president
had
promulgated
rule
1004
in
1964
prior
to
furman,
rather
than
in
1984
after
furman,
his
action
would
have
been
applauded
by
most
as
enlightened
and
protective
of
the
rights
of
service
members
and
properly
so.
the
rule
establishes
important
limitations
on
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
and
therefore
guards
against
the
arbitrary
or
wanton
imposition
of
that
penalty
that
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
furman.
the
rule
establishes
procedures
to
be
followed
by
a
court
martial
in
determining
whether
to
impose
the
penalty,
and
it
provides
that
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
only
when
the
court
martial
finds
one
of...
at
least
one
of
enumerated
factors,
aggravating
factors,
that
the
president
concluded
warranted
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
few
would
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
were
three
aggravating
factors,
one
of
which
was
the
murder...
the
killing
committed
in
the
course
of
the
felony,
in
the
case
the
robbery.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
martial
found
all
three
aggravating
factors
to
be
present
as...
they
were
required
to
identify
which
aggravating
factors
they
relied
upon.
and
then
once
having
done
that,
the
court
martial
is
left
to
determine
whether
the
aggravating
factors
substantially
outweigh
any
mitigating
factors
that
have
been
advanced.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
you
would
have
standing
to
object
that
there
were
not
pre
specified
factors
and
procedures
to
guide
the
court
martial.
now,
whether
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
now,
whether
or
not
such
a
claim
would
be
meritorious
is
different.
i
was
just
addressing
the
question
of
standing.
and
under
furman,
the...
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
was
that
the
death
penalty
had
been
imposed
under
a
scheme
that
allowed
for
too
high
a
risk
that
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
or
may
be
imposed
in
a
particular
case
in
an
arbitrary
or
wanton
manner.
and
that's
what
the
president
addressed
by
narrowing
the
circumstances
under
which
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
paragraph
1,
there
is.
there
has
to
be
a...
it
has
to
be
premeditated.
under
118(4),
it's...
it
is
sufficient--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
the...
if...
in
this...
under
118(4),
the
crime
is
defined
as
a
killing
committed
in
the
course
of
a
felony,
including
robbery.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
aggravating
factors
provide...
for
118(4)--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--4--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that...
i
believe
that
would
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
118(4).
it
would
not
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence.
but
in
this
case
the
aggravating
factor
includes
the...
the
one
relied
upon
in
this
case
is
that
the
defendant
was
the
triggerman
in
this
case.
he
committed
the
killing.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
for
purposes
of
the
death
penalty,
the
aggravating
factor
limits...
in
this
case
limits
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
circumstances
to
where
the
defendant
was
the
triggerman.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
element
of
118(4)...
i
misunderstood.
the
element
for
118(4)
for
the
crime
of
murder
does
not
require
an
intent
to
kill
under
118(4)
where
you
have
felony
murder.
he
has
to
intend
to
commit
the
robbery,
and
in
this
case
he
was
also--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
this
case
he
was
also
the
triggerman.
it's
sufficient
to
convict--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that
would
be...
that's
enough
to
convict
him
of
murder.
there's
the
further
question
of
whether
it's
sufficient
under
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
impose
the
death
penalty,
and
that's
where
the
aggravating
factor
comes
in
that
he
was
the
triggerman.
now,
in
this
case
there
was
that
he
also,
it
seems
quite
clear,
intentionally
killed
both
taxi
drivers.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
you
could.
i
mean,
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
there
would
have
to
be
presumably
some
level
of
culpability,
recklessness
or
gross
negligence
or
something
like
that.
but
in
this
case
the
petitioner
has
not
challenged
the
substance
of
the
aggravating
factors
or
the
court
martial's
finding
of
guilt
for
either
118(1)
or
118(4).
all
that
has
been
challenged
in
this
case
is
not
the
substance
of
the
aggravating
factors,
but
whether
the
president
could
properly
promulgate
them.
and
as
to
that
question,
we
think
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
three
provisions
of
the
uniform
of
code
of
military
justice
are
relevant
to
this
case
and
in
our
view
specifically
authorize
the
president
to
promulgate
factors
in
these
circumstances.
those
are
articles
18,
36,
and
56.
article
18
in
particular
provides
that
the
court
martial,
quote,
may
under
such
limitations
as
the
president
may
prescribe,
comma,
adjudge
any
punishment
not
forbidden
by
this
chapter,
including
the
penalty
of
death
when
specifically
authorized.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
think
that's
not
correct,
and
as
you
pointed
out,
the
rationale
of
the
decision
in
matthews
was
not
that
the
death
authorizing
provision
in
118
was
unconstitutional
and
had
to
be
stricken.
to
the
contrary,
the
court
in
matthews
concluded
that
the
statute
was
still
valid
and
specifically
contemplated
that
the
president
could
promulgate
the
aggravating
factors
and
indeed
contemplated
that
those
could
then
be
applied
in
the
case
of
matthews
himself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
now,
the
president
did
not
do
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
we
think
matthews
was
correct
because
there's
nothing
in
this
court's...
in
furman
or
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
that
establishes
the
separation
of
powers
principle
requiring
that
it
be
a
legislature
to
prescribe
the
aggravating
factors.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
under
the
federal
system
we
believe
the
matthews
court
got
it
right
as
well
because
in
the
military
justice
system,
the...
using
the
furman
framework,
what
the
matthews
court
found
was
that
the
overall
system
for
determining
whether
death
shall
be
imposed
did
not
sufficiently
protect
against
the
arbitrary
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
well,
in
the
military
the
system
is
erected
by
the
combined
power
of
congress
in
passing
statutes,
in
this
case
a
statute
both
authorizing
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
and
authorizing
the
president
to
establish
procedures
and
limits
on
the
penalties,
and
of
course,
the
president's
powers
both
pursuant
to
that
statute
and
pursuant
to
his
inherent
authority
as
commander
in
chief.
so,
the...
particularly
in
the
military
context,
we
think
that
the
separation
of
powers
argument
does
not
carry
any
force
because
the
president
has
preexisting
inherent
authority
which
is
aided
and
augmented
by
the
congress
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
the
matthews
court
recognized
that
and
said
all
we
are
holding
is
that
the
system
currently
in
place,
as
erected
by
the
combined
powers
of
the
congress
and
the
president,
is
not
sufficient,
but
either
one
can
cure
the
defect
we've
identified.
and,
of
course,
the
president
immediately
did
exactly
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and
i
would
think
congress...
we
think
congress
could
delegate
that
power
under
mistretta.
the
delegation
of
the
authority
to
the
sentencing
commission
was
sustained,
and
whether
it
would
go
to
the
president
would
not
be
a
question
of
delegation.
the
court
had
a
footnote
in
mistretta
putting
to
one
side
the
question
of
delegation
to
the
executive,
but
on
the
military
justice
system
where
the
president
sits
at
the...
as
commander
in
chief
sits
at
the
head
of
the
military
and
the
military
justice
system,
he's
uniquely
positioned.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
do
believe
it's
procedural
as
it
has
been...
as
was
described
in
dobbert
and
other
cases.
but
also
in
mistretta,
the
court
addressed
that
very
question
and
said
that
this
may
be
in
a
gray
area
between
substance
and
procedure,
but
notwithstanding
that,
it
may
be
a
sign
to
the
sentencing
commission.
there's
another
important
distinction
between
this
case
and
mistretta,
and
that
is
in
this
case
all
the
president
is
doing
is
imposing
a
limit
on
the
sentences,
unlike
in
mistretta
in
the
sentencing
guidelines.
there's
no
floor.
there's
no
minimum
prescribed
by
the
president
here.
so,
the
president's
authority
is
entirely
ameliorative
both
as
authorized
in
articles
18
and
56
and
also
in
practice.
what
the
president
has
done
is
impose
limits.
we
think
that
that
confirms
that
this
power
was
confirmed...
was
conferred
for
the
benefit
of
service
members
and
that
in
fact
that's
the
way
that
it
operates.
when
the
power
was
first
given
to
the
president
expressly
by
statute
in
1890
to
impose
limitations
on
sentences
established
by
court
martial...
courts
martial,
that
was
done
for
really
two
reasons.
one
was
the
concern
about
a
lack
of
uniformity
in
the
sentences
imposed
by
courts
martial
and
also
by
concerns
that
those
sentences
may
in
many
cases
be
excessive.
both
of
those
are
the
sorts
of
concerns
that
animated
this
court's
decision
in
furman
and
subsequent
cases.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
under
the
statutory
authorization
in
this
case
in
article
18
and
56,
we
think
that
it
clearly
has
that
effect,
and
that
was
the
purpose
that
was
behind
congress...
congress'
giving
that
power
to
the
president
was
to
ensure
some
rationality
and
consistency
with
sentences.
and
congress
concluded
that
the
commander
in
chief
was
the
natural
officer
to
provide
for
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
both
article
56
and
article
18.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
petitioner
argues
that
article
56
makes
no
reference
to
the
death
penalty
and
then
somehow
the
president's
authority
to
limit
sentences
doesn't
apply
to
the
death
penalty.
well,
article
18,
which
establishes
the
jurisdiction
and
concomitant
sentencing
authority
of
the
courts
martial,
specifically
refers
to
the
sentence
of
death.
it
says
that
the...
a
court
martial
shall
have
jurisdiction
over
all
offenses
and
also
may
impose
any
punishment
authorized
by
the
code
and
not
specifically
forbidden
by
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
congress...
congress
would
be
expanding
the
category
of
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
may
now
be
imposed
under
what
the
president--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
i
think
for
constitutional
purposes,
what
congress
has
done
is
authorized
the
death
penalty
in
any
case
falling
within
118,
and
what
the
president
has
done
is
draw
back
from
that
and
limit
the
circumstances
in
which
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
prior
to
the
promulgation
of
rule
1004,
the
court
martial
could
have
imposed
the
death
penalty
in
any
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
i...
my
point
about
limitation
is
only
what
the
president
is
limiting
from
the
universe
of
cases
congress
has
authorized
the
death
penalty--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that...
that's
correct.
the
president
has
drawn
back
from
the
category
of
cases
and
therefore
satisfies
the
concerns
in
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
by
genuinely
narrowing.
and,
again,
petitioner
doesn't
claim
that
there's
not
a
genuine
narrowing.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
i'm
addressing
here...
and
let
me
make
myself
clear.
i'm
addressing
here
the
question
of
whether
the
relevant
articles
of
the
uniform
of
code
of
military
justice
should
be
read
as
a
statutory
matter
to
authorize
the
president
to
do
this.
and
we
think
that
question
really
has
to
be
analyzed
without
regard
to
the
intervening
decision
in
furman.
and
if
one
puts
furman
to
one
side
and
we
have
a
regime,
as
we
did
prior
to
rule
1004's
promulgation
in
which
it
was
essentially
up
to
the
court
martial
to
decide
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty
or
not,
and
the
president
then
establishes
a
regime
under
which
a
far
narrower
category
of
cases
would
be
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
we
think
that,
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
that
that
would
have
been
regarded
by
most
as
an
enlightened
and
ameliorative
sort
of
undertaking
by
the
president--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
that's
exactly
right,
and
therefore
we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
but
for
these
purposes...
and
we
think
particularly
for
whether
the
code
should
be
read
to
authorize
the
president
to
adopt
these
factors,
we
think
it
would
be
odd,
indeed,
if
congress
had
withheld
from
the
commander
in
chief
the
authority
to
narrow
the
circumstances
in
which
courts
martial,
convened
under
his
ultimate
authority,
may
impose
the
death
penalty.
and
there--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i
would
think
in
common
parlance,
that
would
be
less
so.
again,
i
am
addressing
the
question
of
whether
congress
should
be
thought
to
have
withheld
from
the
president--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--56.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it's
always
limiting
whenever
the
president
is
permitting
the
death
penalty
in
less
than
the
full
category
of
cases
that
congress
has
authorized.
and,
again,
when
the
congress
gave
the
president
the
power--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
sorry.
congress--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
court
in
matthews
did
not
so
hold.
what
the
court
held
is
that
the
death
penalty
could
not
be
imposed
under
that
statute
unless
something
further
happened
to
prevent
the
arbitrary
imposition,
which
is
what
the
president
did
in
filling
it
up.
but
we
think
that
there
are...
given
the
special
concerns
with
the
death
penalty
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
it
would
be
perverse
to
conclude
that
congress
withheld
from
the
president
power
over
that.
there's
automatic
appellate
review
of
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
with
all
respect,
i
would
respond
by
saying
the
problem
was
not
in
the
statute
but
in
the
overall
scheme
in
which
the
death
penalty
was
assessed,
and
this
is
the
framework
for
imposition
of
the
penalties.
it
would
be
very
much
like
a
situation
where
any
agency
had
rule
making
authority
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
the
court
said
is
the
death
penalty
may
not
be
imposed
under
the
combination
of
situations
that
were
then
available,
but
specifically
said
that
the
president
could
fill
up
that
gap
by...
under
his
article
36
authority.
and
this
is...
it's
something
like
a
severability
question.
does
the
bare
authorization
from
congress
survive
or
not?
and
the
matthews
court
said
clearly
that
it
does.
it's
clear
we
think
that
congress
wanted
the
death
penalty
to
be
available
in
appropriate
cases
in
the
military.
and
when
you
combine
that
with
a...
with
provisions...
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
has
a
severability
clause,
and
when
you
combine
it
too
with
provisions
for
the
president
to
adopt
limitations
on
punishment
and
to
establish
procedures
under
article
36,
we
think
it's
clear,
that
putting
all
those
together,
that
the
matthews
court
got
it
right
in
not
striking
down
the
death
penalty
authorization
in
article
118
altogether.
i
should
also
say
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
combined
judgment
of
not
only
the
president
of
the
united
states,
as
advised
by
the
justice
department
and
the
secretary
of
defense
when
he
promulgated
rule
1004,
but
also
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
matthews
itself
and
later
in
curtis
and
finally
by
congress
a
year
after
the
promulgation
of
rule
1004
when
congress
enacted
the
special
espionage
provision.
congress
identified
aggravating
factors,
but
then
went
on
to
say
plus
any
other
aggravating
factor
adopted
by
the
president
pursuant
to
article
36,
thereby
recognizing
that
the
president
had
this
authority
under
article
36,
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
1985
enactment
makes
that
clear.
so,
we
have
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the...
first
of
all,
118
doesn't
contain
that
intent
requirement,
but
the
aggravating
factor--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
there's
not...
no.
in
118...
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
misspoke
if
i
said
that.
118(4)
does
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
118--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--again,
for
the
substantive
offense
it's
not
invalid
because
there's...
congress
does
not
have
to
have
an
intent
requirement
in
a
murder
statute.
then
the
only
question
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what
limitations
may
be
imposed
for
the
death
penalty.
and
as
to
that,
again
there
has
been
no
claim
here
that
the
aggravating
factor
is
substantively--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
paragraph
8,
which
is
reproduced
immediately
before
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
8.
number
8
addresses
the
circumstances
under
article
118(4)
for
felony
murder,
and
in
that
case
it
says
where
the
accused
was
the
actual
perpetrator
of
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
negligence
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
unlawful
requirement,
and
i'm
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
i'm
not
sure
what
it
is.
but
he
would
have
to
have
specific
intent
with
respect
to
the
robbery.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
aggravating
factor,
and
that
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that
was
one
of
three
aggravating
factors.
there
was
also...
yes,
that
was
one
of
three
aggravating
factors.
but
there
was...
there
were
two
others,
one
that
the...
premeditated
murder
committed
in
the
course
of
another
crime
as
well
as
murder
where
the
person
was
convicted
in
the
same
proceeding
of
another
murder,
which
we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--on
page
4
of
the
petition,
there
is...
it
identifies
the
aggravating
factors
that
are
relevant
to
the
case.
there's
paragraph
7(b)
and
(j)
and
then
paragraph
8
which
specifically
deals
with
murder
under
article
118(4).
but,
again,
there's
been
no
claim
by
petitioner
in
this
case
that
the
aggravating
factors
are
substantively
invalid,
and
there
has
been
independent
weighing
of
all
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
mitigating
circumstances
by
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
the
executive
order,
as
originally
promulgated,
was
lettered
and
numbered
differently.
rule
1000...
the
executive
order,
as
first
issued
in
january
1984,
was
before
the
entire
revision
of
the
rules
for
court
martial.
that
may
have
been--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--article
36
is
a
further
authorization
for
the
president
to
establish--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
and
congress
we
think
confirmed
that
in
1985
when
it
enacted
the
espionage
statute
and
referred
to
further
aggravating
circumstances
that
the
president
could
adopt
pursuant
to
article
36.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
we
think
the
two
of
them
together...
even
if
there
was
doubt
as
to
one
of
them,
the
two
of
them
together
is
certainly
authorization
enough.
i
should
also
point
out
that
article
71
provides
that
before
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed,
the...
it
has
to
be
approved
by
the
president.
so,
we
think
it's
particularly
unlikely
that
congress
would
have...
would
not
have
authorized
the
president
to
adopt
restrictions
to
be
imposed
directly
on
the
court
martials
themselves.
with
respect
to
the
president's
constitutional
authority,
we
think
that
200
years
of
practice
of
the
president's
inherent
powers
as
commander
in
chief,
as
well
as
congress's
broader
than
usual
delegations
of
power
to
the
president
and
to
courts
martial,
are
sufficient
to
answer
any
delegation
claims.
such
cases
as
swaim
and
mott
by
this
court
recognize
both
the
president's
inherent
authority
to
convene
the
court
martial
and,
in
addition,
the
president's
inherent
authority
in
identifying
circumstances
that
warrant
military
discipline.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
have
not
taken
issue
with
that.
the
court
in
matthews
held
that
it
was
not
as
premeditation
as
defined...
or
has
been
defined
under
the
military
statute.
we
do
say,
though,
in
footnote
6
of
our
brief
that
there
may
be
sufficient
narrowing
in
this
case
within
the
lowenfield
definition
because
this
is
a
statute
that
applies
in
the
special
separate
society
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
parker
v.
levy.
that
combined
with
the
existence
of
the
element
of
premeditation,
for
example,
we
think
would...
might
well
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
requirements.
but
we
have
not
taken
issue
with
that.
the
president
acted
in
response
to
matthews,
and
we
believe
acted
responsibly
in
response
to
matthews.
it
fills
out
an
overall
system
and
scheme
within
the
military
justice
system
to
protect
against
the
arbitrary
or
wanton
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
which
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
this
court's
decision
in
furman.
i
would
also
point
out
that
article
55
of
the
u.c.m.j.
contains
its
own
cruel
or
unusual
punishment
prohibition,
and
we
think
that
that
adds
further
force
to
the
authority
of
the
president
to
tailor
punishments
within
the
military
justice
system
in
response
to
a
situation
such
as
furman
to...
not
to
mention
his
responsibility
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed,
to
tailor
the
military
justice
system
to
satisfy
constitutional
requirements
and
in
this
case
to
tailor
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
to
article
55
which
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
read
to
contain
much
the
same
standards.
