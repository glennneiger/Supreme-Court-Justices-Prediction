so,
you
want
us
to
hold
that
congress
could
not
delegate
to
the
president
this
authority.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
your
best
case
for
that
proposition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
asked
what
your
best
case
was
for
that
proposition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
take
the
position
that
the
aggravating
factors
are
an
element
of
the
crime,
do
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
are
elements
of
the
crime?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
the
answer
is
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there's
a
different
way
to
look
at
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--because
the
aggravating
circumstances
are
not
an
element...
are
not
elements
of
the
crime.
and
congress
has
authorized
the
president
to
prescribe
limitations
on
punishment,
including
for
the
death
penalty,
and
that
seems
to
be
a
pretty
specific
authorization.
so,
viewed
in
that
way,
why
isn't
it
properly
viewed
as
a
limitation
on
punishment
that
the
president
has
prescribed?
