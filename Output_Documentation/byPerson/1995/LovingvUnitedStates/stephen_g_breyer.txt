justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
the
holding?
that
is,
is
there
a
case?
can
you
cite
a
case,
which
i
would
then
like
to
read,
which
says
that
a
statute
which
says
the
death
penalty
is
reserved
for
those
who
murder
with
premeditation?
is
there
a
case
that
says
that
that
is
insufficiently...
is
too
broad,
is
not
sufficiently
narrow
under
furman?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
that
issue
then
is
open.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
might
but,
i
mean,
that's
why
i'm
looking
for
a
precedent.
what
is
the
strongest
precedent
in
your
opinion
that
would
suggest
or
show
or
hold
that
a
murder
statute
that
says
the
death
penalty
is
reserved
for
murder
with
premeditation
is
too
broad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
asked
you
for
the
strongest
precedent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
any
felony
murder.
it's
five
specific
crimes
burglary,
sodomy,
rape,
robbery,
or
aggravated
arson.
so,
if...
i
suppose
that
if
all
that
were
at
stake
were
that
provision,
i
guess
maybe
that
would
comply
with
furman,
wouldn't
it?
if
all...
if
that
were
the
only
thing
because
that's
pretty
specific,
but
there's
this
other
thing.
that's
why
i'm
asking
to
be
sure
i
get
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
is
there
a
precedent
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
just
want
you
to
make
in
a
sentence
remain...
your
main
argument.
if
i
assume
that
furman
talked
about
law
and
said
the
law
to
sentence
someone
to
death
has
to
be
reasonably
specific.
if
the
law
prior
to
the
regulations
was
not
specific
enough,
the
law
after
the
regulations
was
specific
enough.
then
you
said,
but
the
president
does
not
have
the
authority
to
promulgate
the
regulations
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
part
i'd
like
you
xx
explain--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
little
bit
because
the
president
does
things
very
often
under
very
broad
delegations
of
authority,
and
why
does
that
general
principle,
the
only
case
to
the
contrary
being
schechter
and
panama
refining
i
guess,
not
apply
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
make
matters
worse,
but
as
i
read
this,
at
least
on
page
4
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
where
they
have
it
here,
the
aggravating
factors
in
respect
to
robbery,
felony
murder,
et
cetera
apply
only
in
the
case
of
violation
of
article
118(1),
and
article
118(1)
is
the
article
that
says
you
have
to
have
premeditation.
so,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
it's
paragraph--
--h.--
--in
other
words.
it's
h.--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
then
i'm,
with
justice
scalia,
somewhat
confused
because
of
the...
118(4)
does
permit
conviction
of
a
person
engaged
in
robbery
who,
let's
say,
negligently
and
therefore
unlawfully
without
excuse
or
justification
kills
someone
else.
and
that,
provided
he's
the
person
who
did
it
negligently
and
therefore
unlawfully,
would
permit
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or,
let's
say,
gross
negligence
or
whatever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
person
has
been
convicted
under
number
8,
which
i
hadn't
focused
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
which
means
that
this
person
has
been
convicted
under
a
provision
that
allows
a
person
to
be
sentenced
to
death
if
that
person
has
either
negligently
or
recklessly,
let's
say,
without
excuse
in
the
course
of
a
robbery
killed
someone.
