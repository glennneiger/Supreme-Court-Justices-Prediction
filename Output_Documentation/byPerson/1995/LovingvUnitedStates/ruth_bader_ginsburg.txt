under--
--but,
of
course--
--excuse
me.
under
subsection
4,
at
least
one
of
those
is
arguably
out
under
coker
v.
georgia.
rape
is
the
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
so,
we
have
both
before
us
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blume,
i
understood
you
to
have
an
anterior
argument,
and
if
i'm
wrong,
please
tell
me.
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
there
had,
in
fact,
been
no
delegation
to
the
president
because
this
statute
was
made
unconstitutional
by
your
reading
of
furman.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
you're
correct
about
that.
and,
therefore,
any
delegation
that
might
have
been
given
under
some
other
regime
was
not
given
under
a
statute
written
to
conform
to
the
furman
decision.
i
thought
that
you
were
saying
there
hasn't
been
any
delegation,
so
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
question
what
if
congress
rewrote
this
statute
post
furman
and
had
a
delegation
in
it.
i
thought
that
was
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
the
military
court
say
precisely
what
justice
souter
said?
that
the
statute
as...
is...
has
an
infirmity,
and
the
court
said,
and
there
are
two
people
who
can
cure
it,
two
bodies
who
can
cure
it
the
executive,
the
president,
or
the
legislature.
so,
that
was
exactly
the
theory
that
the
matthews
case
put
forward.
and
i
thought
earlier
you
were
saying
that
matthews
misread
furman
in
thinking
that
the
president
could
provide
the
cure,
that
the
only
person
who
could...
the
only
body
that
could
provide
the
cure
was
the
legislature.
i
thought
that
was
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
that
the
states
reacted
to
furman,
all
of
them,
by
having
the
legislature
do
the
repair
job,
but
was
there
anything
in
this
court
decision
that
required
the
narrowing
to
be
declared
by
a
state
legislature,
say,
as
opposed
to
the
state's
highest
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
interrupt
you
at
this
point?
because
you
are
assuming
that
a
statute
written
before
furman
with
this
regime
can
govern
afterwards.
in
other
words,
you're
assuming
the
correctness
of
the
military
court's
position
in
matthews
that
there
was
an
infirmity,
the
lack
of
narrowing
circumstances,
and
that
that
infirmity
could
be
cured
by
the
executive
or
by
the
legislature.
so,
you're
rejecting
mr.
blume's
first
point.
you're
assuming
that
that's
not
worth
arguing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--my
question
to
you
is,
was
matthews
right
to
that
extent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
not
so
far
as
the
state
level
is
concerned,
as
justice
scalia
asked...
said.
i
don't
know
anything
that
requires
the
states
to
have
any
particular
separation
of
powers.
but
the...
on
the
federal
level,
the
constitution
does
require
the
division
that
we
know
between
the
legislature
and
the
executive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.
kneedler,
let's
go
back
to
the...
putting
furman
in
because
that's
the
big
question.
it
would
be
perverse.
all
of
this
is
highly
speculative
because
congress
passed
this
regime
with
article
18,
36,
56
long
before
there
was
a
furman.
so,
it's
now
going
back
and
saying
if
congress
knew
about
furman,
it
would
have
done
the
same
thing.
and
i
know
about
the
special
context
in
which
we're
operating,
but
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
any
other
situation
in
which
there
is
a
constitutional
flaw,
as
the
military
court
said,
in
a
statute
and
the
executive
is
allowed
to
do
the
repair
job?
is
there
any
other
example
that
comes
to
mind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought,
am
i
wrong,
that
the
military
court
said
this
statutory
regime,
as
it
now
exists,
won't
do.
there
must
be
something
more--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--added
to
what
congress
has
legislated.
