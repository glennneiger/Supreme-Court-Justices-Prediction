was
it
clear
in
this
case
that
it
was
the
felony
aspect
of
the
homicides
committed
with
premeditation
that
were
the
aggravators?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
they
specific
in
their
findings,
or
did
they
just
say
that
they
were
all
aggravated
under
c
which
is
the
felony
murder--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
a
non
military
case,
could
congress
have
the
authority
to
delegate
the
power
to
the
president
to
specify
aggravating
factors
for
capital
offenses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
obviously
a
much
different
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--turning
back
to
the
hypothetical
case
of
delegation
in
the
civil...
or
the
non
military
context,
is
your
statement
that
the
delegation
would
be
permitted
based
on
the
premise
that
this
is
a
procedural
act
versus
a
substantive
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
act
of
aggravating?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
congress
had
enacted
a
statute
or
a
scheme
where
there
were
four
aggravating
factors
and
then
the
president
added,
say,
four
more,
you
wouldn't
consider
that
as
being
ameliorative
or
limiting,
would
you?
because
then
president
is
expanding
the
universe
of
offenses
that
are
subject
to
capital
punishment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
specification
of
aggravating
factors
is...
isn't
always
a
limiting
function.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whether
aggravating...
the
specification
of
aggravating
factors
are
limiting
or
not
limiting,
it
seems
to
me
is
quite
important
given
article
56.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
article
18.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
president
tomorrow
were
to
add
a
further
list
of
aggravating
factors,
would
this
be
limiting
the
punishment,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
my
assumption
is,
is
that
the
president
tomorrow--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--enacts
of
further
list
of
aggravating
factors.
it
would
be
a
little
bit
hard
to
say
that
that
limits
the
death
penalty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
hypothetical,
i
asked
how
is
that
limiting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
my
hypothetical
is
that
tomorrow
he
adds
a
further
list
of
aggravating
factors.
i'm
asking
how
that
is
limiting.
