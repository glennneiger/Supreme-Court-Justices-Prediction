mr.
john
h.
blume
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
several
questions
regarding
whether
and
under
what
circumstances
the
president
is
permitted
to
create
aggravating
factors
for
military
capital
cases.
in
this
court
we
have
presented
several
challenges
to
the
creation
of
these
factors,
ranging
from
the
most
broad
to
this
is
a
nondelegatable
power
to
the
most
narrow,
that
congress
failed
to
provide
the
president
with
an
intelligible
principle.
in
considering
all
of
these
issues,
however,
some
historical
perspective
is
necessary.
in
article
i,
section
8,
clause
14,
the
framers
gave
to
congress
and
not
the
president
the
plenary
power
to
make
rules
for
the
government
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
they
did
so
for
a
reason
and
from
a
very
historical
vantage
point.
not
only
were
they
distrustful
of
executive
control
of
the
military
in
general,
but
they
were
wary
of
broad
court
martial
jurisdiction.
the
framers
and
those
who
influenced
their
political
thought
had
lived
under
martial
law
and
had
witnessed
and
suffered
through
the
abuses
of
military
power.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
clear
that
does
not
suffice.
all
article
118
is...
it
sets
forth
four
theories
under
which
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
murder.
one
is
premeditated
and
number
four
is
a
felony
murder
theory.
this
is
much
like
every
murder
statute--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--because
the
teaching
of
furman
is
that
there
has
to
be
something
beyond
murder.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
true.
there
was...
there
were
a
number
of
different
opinions,
but
the
consensus
of
it
seems
to
be
that
there
has
to
be
murder
plus
something.
it
is
not
enough
if
you
are
just
merely
found
guilty
of
murder.
all
118
does
is
sets
forth
a
set
of
four
theories.
it
does
say
and
you
can
only
get
death
for
118(1)
or
118(4).
mr.
john
h.
blume
but,
justice
scalia,
there
were
numerous
statutes
which
existed
like
this
at
the
time
of
furman,
all
of
which
were
found
to
be
unconstitutional.
pennsylvania
made
the
argument
on
rehearing
after
furman
that
premeditation
is
enough,
that
we
have
narrowed
because
of
premeditation,
and
rehearing
was
denied.
this
is
the
way
all
statutes
looked.
all
118
is
is
four
different
theories
of
murder.
it
does--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--no,
but
a
number
of
them
were
reversed
and
vacated
in
light
of
furman
and
sent
back
for--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--further
work.
mr.
john
h.
blume
they
did
not,
but
i
do
not
see
how
it
is
consistent
with
furman
to
say
that
premeditation
alone
is
enough.
there
were
numerous
premeditation
statutes.
murder,
that
was
all
they
had.
and
you
could
get
mandatory
death
or
discretionary
death
for
premeditated
murder,
and
those
were
not
sufficient.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no.
i
know
of
no
case
which
says
premeditation
alone
is
enough,
but
if
you
look
at--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
if
you
look
at
all
the
statutes
which
were
before
the
court
in
furman,
the
way
they
looked,
this
looks
like
numerous
statutes
which
were
in
existence
at
the
time.
it
looks
a
lot
like
20
u.s.c.
111
which
is
the
federal
murder
statute.
mr.
john
h.
blume
there
is
no
case
that
says
exactly
that.
if
you
look
at
gregg
and
furman--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--and
then
if
you
look
even
at
lowenfield,
which
is
the
case
which
brought
us
to
this,
as
i
understand
lowenfield,
it
says
that,
well,
this
narrows
because
you
have--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i've
been
confused
with
many
people.
but
lowenfield
indicates
that
the
reason
that
is
sufficient,
the
reason
the
guilt
phase
narrowing
in
lowenfield
is
sufficient
because
they're
very...
it's
very
narrowly
tailored.
you
have
a
specific
mens
rea
requirement
of
premeditation
plus
some
additional
felony,
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
distinguished
that.
you
don't
have
that
here.
you
have
either
premeditation,
premeditation
alone
as
a
basis
under
which
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
murder,
or
felony
murder,
garden
variety
felony
murder
under
118(4),
which
there's
absolutely
no
mens
rea
requirement
at
all.
if
that
was
sufficient,
there
would
be
no
narrowing
in
any
event.
mr.
john
h.
blume
but
there
is
no
mens
rea
requirement
in
118(4).
it's
just
a
felony
murder
theory.
it's
a
theory
under
which
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
murder,
and--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it's
substantive
criminal
law.
all
these
are...
if
you
look
at
them
and
you
look
at
all
the
statutes,
they
are...
they're
like
every
statute
which
existed
at
the
time.
there
were
ways
in
which
you
could
be
found
guilty
of
murder.
you
could
be
found
guilty
of
murder
in
some
states
as
premeditated
murder;
in
some
states
it's
felony
murder.
this
just
lays
out
the
various
four
theories
under
which
you
can
be
found
guilty.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
is
under
118(4).
there
is
no--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--kills.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes.
it's
just
a
theory
under
which
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
felony
murder.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
the
way
virtually
all
the
statutes
look.
i
mean,
in
this
regard
it's
just
a
little
different
grammatically
of
the
federal
murder
statute,
20
u.s.c.
1...
1011.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
correct.
and
what's
also...
i
mean,
it's
also
furman
and
gregg
and
the
other
cases
when
they
indicate
that
there
has
to
be
murder
plus
something,
and
it
has
to
be
done
at
some
phase
of
the
proceeding.
it's
not
merely
enough.
there
has
to
be
a
principled
way
to
distinguish
people
within
the
class
of
those
guilty
of
murder
as
who's
deserving
of
death
and
who's
not.
and
118
does
not
do
that.
it
just
sets
forth
various
theories
under
which
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
murder.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
if
that...
well,
if
it
were
murder
in
the
commission
of
a
rape,
i
guess
it
would
depend
on
what
the
intent
was.
but,
i
mean,
i
don't
think
in
any
event
no
one
has
ever
argued...
the
government
has
never
even
argued...
that
118
standing
alone
is
constitutionally
sufficient.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
that's
true.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
it's...
there
are
a
number
of
states
in
which
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
murder,
and
then
there
has...
under
some
type
of
felony
murder
basis,
and
then
at
sentencing
there
has
to
be
some
other
additional
finding,
some
other
aggravating
finding.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well
my
answer
to
justice
scalia
is,
is
that
118
is
only
a
substantive
murder
statute.
there
has--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--no.
what
i
was
trying
to
say
is,
is
that
all
118
does
is
provide
four
different
theories
under
which
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
murder.
mr.
john
h.
blume
under
118(4).
118(1)
is
if
you
kill
somebody
with
a
premeditated
design
to
kill.
that's
118(1).
mr.
john
h.
blume
no.
i
don't
think
there's
any
intent
to
kill
read
into
118(4).
mr.
john
h.
blume
there
are
two
convictions.
mr.
john
h.
blume
one
for
118(1)
and
one
for
118(4).
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
true.
mr.
john
h.
blume
the...
on
the
separation
of
powers
issue,
our
most
broad
submission
that
this
is
a
power
which
cannot
be
delegated.
the
core
constitutional
value,
as
justice
scalia
stated
in
mistretta
and
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
stated
in
industrial
union,
is
that
basic
and
critical
policy
choices
governing
society
are
to
be
made
by
the
congress,
or,
put
differently,
it's
the
hard
choices
and
not
the
filling
in
of
blanks
which
the
congress--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
this
particular
power
is
nondelegatable.
we
have
several
challenges
to
it,
but
i
think
it
is
nondelegatable.
mr.
john
h.
blume
the
best...
i
think
the
fundamental
problem
with
delegating
this
to
the
president,
if
you
want
to
get
down
to
the
root
of
it...
there
are
several
problems
with
it,
in
addition
to
the
history
and
wanting
to
keep
the
executive
out
of
this
power,
but
it
creates
the
impermissible
blending
of
functions.
mr.
john
h.
blume
the
best
case
i
think
would
be
ex
parte
milligan
and
reid
v.
covert
where
they
say
that
if
the
president
has
the
power
to
create
substantive
rules
of
law
in
court
martial
context,
then
you
have
the
impermissible
blending
of
functions.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
dealt...
it
makes
the
statement
that
if
you...
if
the
president
has
substantive
rule
making
power,
substantive...
the
power
to
define
crimes
in
the
court
martial
context.
milligan
was
about
whether
the
declaration
of
war
suspended
civil
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
h.
blume
this
court
has
referred
to
aggravating
circumstances--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
you
have
to
look
at...
this
court
has
called
aggravating
circumstances
substantive
criteria
at
the
level
of
legislative
definition.
that's
why--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--no.
i
take
the
position
that
they
are
substantive
factors.
mr.
john
h.
blume
this
court
has
said
they
are
not
elements
of
the
crime.
mr.
john
h.
blume
but
substantive
procedure,
justice
o'connor,
is
a
spectrum
and
things
fall
along
a
spectrum.
and
it's
true
that
aggravating
circumstances,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
delimit
the
pool
of
persons
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
the
question--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--absolutely,
and
i
think
with
all
due
respect
it
is
precisely
because
the
president
is
commander
in
chief
that
he
can't
do
this
because--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--that
is...
we
make
a
range
of
arguments
from
the
most
broad
to
the
most
narrow.
this
is
a
nondelegatable
power,
which
is
the
issue
i
was
addressing,
and
then
even
if
it
is
a
delegatable
power,
that
there
has
been
no
delegation
here,
that
after
118
was
invalidated
by
the
military
courts
in
matthews,
was
found
to
be
inadequate
under
furman,
that
it
was
the
congress
and
not
the
president
which
had
to
come
back
and
do
something.
and
congress
did
not
authorize
the
president
to
create
the
aggravating
factors
in
r.c.m.
1004.
and
i
think--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--that's
true.
i
mean,
i
think--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--because
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
it
pragmatically
as
it
unfolded.
what
i
think
that
does
is
try
and
make
sense
of
events
which
happened
beforehand
from
a
1996
perspective.
look
at
this
as
it
unfolded.
in
1950,
the
congress
enacted
a
murder
statute
which
set
forth
several
theories
of
murder
and
said
you
can
be
sentenced
to
death
or
life
in
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
court
martial
under
one
of
these
two
theories.
that's
all
it
said.
furman
comes
along
and
says
the
statute
and
all
the
statutes
like
these
are
unconstitutional,
that
something
else
has
to
happen.
there
has
to
be
marder
plus
something.
now,
what
remained
then
was
a
murder
statute
with
a
penalty
of
life
imprisonment
under
the
doctrine
of
severability.
you
severe
out
what's
bad--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--and
you
keep
what's
good.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
was
held
unconstitutional
by
the
military
courts
in
the
united
states
v.
matthews.
they
said
this
does
not
satisfy
furman.
mr.
john
h.
blume
in
1983,
and
that's
what
led
to
this.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
that
you
would
be
wrong
to
the
extent
that
the
president
can
do
this.
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--the
question
is...
then--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--okay.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no,
and
i
think
that's
similar
to
what
happened.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
the
constitutional...
i
think,
one,
it's
not...
you're
sort
of
trying
to
carry
forward
some
underlaying
congressional
intent
for
there
to
be
a
death
penalty
in
this
context,
which
is
difficult
to
do
under
these
circumstances.
and,
two,
it's
the--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
don't
know
that
that's--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--but
if
you're
trying
to
say
that--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
don't
understand...
it
seems
to
me
that
all
roads
lead
to
rome
if
you
use
your
analysis.
the
bottom
line
is
that
118
was
invalid
as
a
basis
for
imposing
the
death
penalty.
mr.
john
h.
blume
and,
well,
there's
no
question,
i
don't
think,
that
something
else
had
to
happen
to
bring
this
into
compliance.
the
military
court
said
this
statute
violates
furman.
somebody
has
to
go
out
and
create
some
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
that's
correct.
they
did
misread.
they
said
the
statute
was
invalid.
they
said
there
had
to
be
some
additional
aggravating
circumstances,
and
then
they
said
either
the
president
or
the
congress
can
do
it.
they
were
wrong
about
whether
the
president
can
do
it.
and
now
in
this
court
the
issue
is,
one,
can
the
president
do
it
and,
two,
even
if
he
can
do
it,
has
congress
allowed
him
to
do
it?
and
i
think
the
answer
to
both
those
questions
is
no.
mr.
john
h.
blume
there...
all
the
language
in
furman
and
gregg
and
all
the
opinions
indicates
that
this
is
a
quintessential
legislative
function,
that
it
is
the
legislatures
which
express
the
moral
will
of
the
people--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--this
case
does
not
present
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
state
separation
of
powers
doctrine.
in
this
particular
context,
the
answer
may
be
if
you
had
a
state
case,
then
at
least
in
this
limited
regard,
that
the
legislatures
have
to
do
this.
that's
not
presented
here.
mr.
john
h.
blume
under
the
eighth
amendment,
and
this
court
has
said...
what
is
the
eighth
amendment
concerned
about?
the
evolution
of
standards,
which
is
found
in
legislative
embodiments,
the
collective
will
of
the
people,
and
in
regularization
of
punishment.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it's
my
understanding
that
the
eighth
amendment
has...
concerns
both,
regularization
of
punishment,
which
is
the
nonarbitrariness,
which
is
certainly
not
an
executive
function,
and
evolution
of
standards.
that's
what,
if
you
look
at
the
categorical
cases,
they
say,
well,
we're
going
to
look
at
how
society
has
evolved
and
where
do
we
see
that?
we
see
that
in
the
collective
will
of
the
people,
the
legislatures.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i
mean,
my
argument
is
not
contingent
on
that
at
all.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i'm
saying
in
this
particular
context
the
court
has
indicated
it
is
a
legislative
responsibility
to
decide
who
should
live
and
who
should
die.
it's
a
fundamental
policy
choice
which
should
be
made--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--because
if
you
allow
him
to
do
so,
it
will
create
the
impermissible
blending
of
functions
which
is
separate.
look
at
all
the
things
he
does
in
this
context.
mr.
john
h.
blume
he--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
on
the
issue...
i
understand
you
to
be
asking
me
why
would
this
create
the
blending
of
functions
problem,
which
is...
i
mean,
there
are
a
number
of
other...
on
that
particular
issue,
if
you
look
at
it,
he
has
executive
prosecutorial
power.
he
supervises
the
judge
advocate
general
who
picks
the
prosecuting
lawyer,
the
defense
lawyer,
the
trial
judge,
and
the
judges
on
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals.
he
also
picks
the
convening
authority.
he
supervises
the
convening
authority,
the
post
commander
who
decides
that
this
is
a
capital
case
and
then
who
selects
the
court
martial
panel.
he,
the
president,
then
appoints
the
judges
on
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces.
he
under
71(a)
has
clemency
power.
so,
now
you're
saying
that
not
only
does
he
prosecute
the
cases,
not
only
does
he
supervise
the
judges,
he
has
prosecutorial
power
and
judicial
power,
but
he
also
has
the
substantive
power
to
define
the
class,
the
legislative
power,
the
power
to
define
the
class
of
persons
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no,
they
volunteer.
but
still...
i
mean,
the
fact
that
the
service
members
have...
may
have
limited
rights
under
certain
circumstances,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
that's
true,
that
it
is
a
separate
society,
and
there
are
some
things
you
can
do
to
military
people
you
can't
do
to
others.
but
it's
also
said
on
every
single
occasion
that
it
is
congress'
job
not
the
president's.
the
framers
specifically
wanted
to
keep
the
president
out
of
this,
that
they
wanted
the
congress
to
decide
and
to
balance
the
rights
of
service
members,
not
the
president.
mr.
john
h.
blume
there
has
been
some
combination,
but
it's
also
that's
why
in
milligan
and
reid
v.
covert
they
said
if
the
president
can
define
crimes
which
is...
although
this
is
not
strictly
the
definition
of
a
crime,
functionally
it
works
much
more
like
that.
aggravating
circumstances
create
the
pool.
that's
on
a
spectrum
from
beginning
to
end.
it's
much
closer
to
that.
then
the
blending
is
complete.
and
this
court,
in
the
military
context,
has
said
the
president
cannot
have
all
that
power.
i
mean,
in
a
way
they...
sure,
they
do
have
less
power,
but
are
we
going
to
tell
the
parents
of
these
service
members
that,
yes,
join
the
army
and
if
you
commit
a
capital
crime,
you
have
absolutely
no
rights?
this
court
has
never
said
that.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it's
congress'
job.
mr.
john
h.
blume
my
time
is
up.
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
john
h.
blume
article
56
is
what
you're
referring
to,
justice
o'connor,
but
it
has
no
applicability
in
a
capital
case.
all
it
says
is
the
president
can
set
maximum
punishments.
that
has
no
applicability
here.
the
maximum
is
set.
but
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
you
see
the
history
of
article
56
and
these
other
articles,
congress
was
attempting
to
make
clear
that
only
it
had
the
power
to
decide
when
a
service
member
should
be
sentenced
to
death.
the
when
otherwise...
when
authorized
by
this
chapter,
the
penalty
of
death
under
article
18
was
put
in
there
to
assure
members
of
congress
that
only
the
congress
could
decide
when
you
got
death
and
56
has
no
applicability.
mr.
john
h.
blume
thank
you.
