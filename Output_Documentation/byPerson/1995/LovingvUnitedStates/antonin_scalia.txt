justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lowenfield,
before
you
go
too
much
further...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
blume.
i'm
thinking
of
the
case
i'm
going
to
ask
you
about.
there...
most
of
your
argument
is
based
on
separation
of
powers.
there
is
another
separation
of
powers
issue
it
seems
to
me
and
that
is
the
standing
problem.
even
if
we
assume
that
the
president
has
no
power
to
specify
what
crimes
shall
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
congress
itself
in
10
u.s.c.,
section
918
has
specified
two.
it
has
specifically
said
that
anyone
who
unlawfully
kills
a
human
being
when
he,
number
one,
has
a
premeditated
design
to
kill,
and
number
four,
is
engaged
in
the
perpetration
or
attempted
perpetration
of
burglary,
sodomy,
rape,
robbery
or
aggravated
arson.
in
those
two
instances,
congress
has
said
he
shall
suffer
death
or
imprisonment
for
life.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
specification
is
sufficient,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
or
not
the
president
has
authority
to
add
additional
aggravating
circumstances
so
long
as
those
two
suffice.
is
it
clear
that
those
two
alone
don't
suffice?
premeditated
design
to
kill
or
killing
in
the
perpetration
of
those
particular
crimes?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't.
no,
it's
quite
different
because
the
way
918...
this
is
on
page
145
of
the
joint
appendix,
by
the
way.
the
way
918
ends
is,
in
all
four
of
those
situations
specified
he's
guilty
of
murder
and
shall
suffer
such
punishment
as
a
court
martial
may
direct.
and
if
it
ended
there,
then
you
would
possibly
be
into
the
argument
that
you
want
to
make
to
us
whether
the
president
has
the
authority
to
specify
what
shall
obtain
the
death
penalty.
it
doesn't
end
there,
though.
and
it
says,
except
that
if
found
guilty
under
clause
1
or
4,
he
shall
suffer
death
or
imprisonment
for
life
as
a
court
martial
may
direct.
now,
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
specification
whether
or
not
the
president
adds
additional
ones?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
1
is
premeditated
design
to
kill.
that's
something
more
than
just
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
held
in
furman
that
no
statute
that
then
existed
in
the
united
states
was
valid?
justice
antonin
scalia
either
lowenfield
or
blume.
i
don't
remember
which.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
but
he's
asking
you
if
4
is
bad
for
that
reason,
why
don't
you
make
that
direct
attack
on
4
and
say
that
there's
no
requirement
that
he
have
had
an
intent
to
kill
which
our
case
law
requires?
isn't
that
intent
to
kill
read
into
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
well,
then
i
guess
the
conviction
is
invalid
no
matter
what.
we
have
a...
yes.
we
have
a
much
more
fundamental
problem.
is
there
a
conviction
here
for
premeditated
murder
under
1
as
well
as
under
4?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
to
put
that
another
way,
if
there
were
one
worst
of
all
case
in
which
to
revive
schechter,
surely
it's
a
case
dealing
with
the
president's
power
as
commander
in
chief.
we
haven't
used
schechter
at
all
in
over
half
a
century,
and
you
want
us
to
revive
it
in
a
case
involving
the
president's
power
as
commander
in
chief.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
case
of
our
that
imposes
a
separation
of
powers
obligation
upon
the
states?
i
had
thought,
as
far
as
our
case
law
is
concerned,
that
states
can
go
to
an
english
parliamentary
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
under
the
eighth
amendment.
nothing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
it
was
concerned
with
that.
i
thought
it
was
concerned
with
avoiding
flukish
results,
and
flukish
results
can
be
avoided
whether
it's
the
legislature
that
promulgates
the
narrowing
or
anybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
he
oppress
people
into
the
army?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
should
think
it
is
obvious
from
our
history
that
the
degree
of
separation
of
powers
that
we
insist
upon
in
the
rest
of
society
we
have
not
insisted
upon
in
the
system
of
justice
in
the
military.
i
mean,
it
has
always
been
the
case
that
at
least
the
executive
and
the
judicial
functions
have
been
combined.
is
that
not
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
did
he
narrow...
is
there
a...
an
intent
to
kill
requirement
in
section
918?
justice
antonin
scalia
accidental
killing
would
be
enough
to
impose
the
death
penalty
under
4?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
asking
just
about
4,
not
the
aggravating
factors.
suppose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
i
drop
a
gun
during
a
holdup.
the
guns
goes
off
and
kills
somebody.
is
that
enough
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
10
u.s.c.,
section
918
(4)?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
have
an
accidental
triggerman,
can't
you?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
in
limiting
the
statutory
authorization--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
the
constitutional
authorization
is
your
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
we
shouldn't
call
them
narrowing
factors
because
the
same
thing
is
true
about
any
narrowing
factor.
it's
really
an
expanding
factor.
if
a
state
does
not
adopt
them,
the
state
cannot
impose
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
help
me
out
here.
this
may
be
a
little
bit
beside
the
path,
but
it's
just
bugging
me.
i
cannot
figure
out
where
the
intent
to
kill
requirement
in
article
118
comes
from.
all
the
president
has
added
to
the
text
by
his
order
is
that
the
defendant
be
the
actual
perpetrator
of
the
killing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
perpetrate
the
killing
without
intending
to
kill.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
you
be
the
perpetrator.
but
you
do
say
there
is
an
intent
to
kill
requirement
in
118,
or
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
by...
it
hasn't
been
imported
into
it
by
the
presidential
order
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
is
it
now...
as
it
now
stands,
i
guess
that
means
118(4)
is
invalid,
constitutionally
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
where's
the
number
8
you're
referring
to?
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
in
the
manual.
8
in
the
manual
is
h
in
the
statute...
in
the
executive
order,
as
i
read
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
kneedler,
does
the
government
believe
that
premeditation
is
a
sufficient
narrowing
to
comply
with
furman?
