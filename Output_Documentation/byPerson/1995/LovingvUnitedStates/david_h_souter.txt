justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it
does...
it
doesn't
dispense
with
a
mens
rea
requirement,
doesn't
it?
because
you
still
have
the
mens
rea
requirement
necessary
for
murder.
you
simply
have
the
overlay
of
these
felonies
as
being
the
basis
for
the
requirement
that
death
be
imposed.
that's
not
a
dispensation
with
mens
rea.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
118(4)
say
killing
in
connection
with
or
murder
in
connection
with?
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
kills
a
human
being.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
says...
oh,
it
says...
merely
says
kills.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
go
back
to
where
your
answer
takes
us?
assuming
that
there
are
aggravating
factors
added
to
these
definitions,
we're
still
left
without
mens
rea,
aren't
we?
the
aggravating
factors
don't
apply...
don't
supply
mens
rea.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
why
isn't
your
argument
that
there's
no
mens
rea
requirement
and
therefore
there's
something
more
fundamentally
defective
than
simply
the
problem
of
delegation
with
respect
to
aggravating
factors?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
your
argument...
i
just
want
to
understand
your
argument,
and
i
thought
your
argument
was,
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
that
in
fact
that
still
leaves
us
with
an
incomplete
murder
statute
because
there's
no
mens
rea
requirement.
now,
if
we
add,
let's
assume,
with
proper
delegation
or
with
congressional
action
a
series
of
aggravating
factors
on
top
of
it,
we're
still
left
with
the
problem
which
was
the
basis
for
your
answer
to
him.
or
do...
what
am
i
missing?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your
answer
was
that
it
isn't
even
that.
it's
not
a
complete
murder
statute,
and
you
said
it
was
incomplete
because
there
was
no
mens
rea
requirement.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
i
thought
you
said
one
of
the
things
that
it
doesn't
provide
is
mens
rea.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that...
that
argument
assumes
that
the
statute
was
invalid,
i
take
it,
from
the
moment
of
furman
and,
therefore,
the
statute
which
authorizes
the
president
to
narrow
the
circumstances
of
imposition
could
not
have
applied
to
it
because
it
didn't
exist
at
that
point.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
we
make
that
assumption?
why
don't
we
assume,
taking
even
a
very
broad
reading
of
furman,
that
what
furman
required
was,
among
other
things,
as
we
now
see
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
some
narrowing
function,
and
that
in
fact
the
delegation
to
provide
that
narrowing
function
was
on
the
books?
and,
therefore,
unless
the
delegation
itself
is
unconstitutional,
furman
did
not
automatically
result
in
the
obliteration
of
the
statute,
and
the
statute
was
saved
under
the
authority
of
the
president
to
narrow
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
why
isn't
that
just
as
good
as...
an
analysis
as
the
one
that
you
assume?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
if
i
may.
what
if
this
case
had
come
directly
to
us,
let's
say,
post
furman
and
we
had
said,
well,
the
statute
as
it
stands
may
not
be
applied
because
there
is...
there's
no
narrowing
function
provided
for
it
and,
therefore,
it
simply
may
not
be...
the
death...
the
statute
may
not
be
applied,
the
death
penalty
may
not
be
imposed
unless
and
until
the
president
engages
in
this
narrowing
function
or
somebody
engages
in
this
narrowing
function,
the
president
or
congress?
following
our
decision,
the
president
had
promulgated
some
aggravating
factors
in
discharge
of
his
legal
authority
to
provide
a
narrowing
of
the
statute's
application.
would
we
have
been
bound
to
declare
that
invalid?
in
other
words,
would
there
have
been
something
wrong
with
our...
constitutionally
wrong
with
our
analysis
in
saying
merely
the
statute
may
not
be
applied
unless
and
until
narrowing
takes
place?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
not
my
question.
that's
not
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question
is,
assuming
the...
that
this
authority
can
be
delegated...
just
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
we
have
committed
a
constitutional
error,
as
it
were,
would
we
have
overlooked
something
constitutionally
if
we
had
said
not
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
forever
and
ever,
but
that
it
may
not
be
applied
until
there
is
some
promulgation
of
narrowing
standards?
and
once
there
is,
if
there
is,
the
statute
may
then
be
applied.
would
we
have
overlooked
something
if
we
had
chosen
that
way
to
analyze
the
statute's
defect?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
may
we
not
look
back
to
the
statute
now
and
say
that
is
the
effect
which
we
are
going
to
give
to
furman,
assuming
a
broad
reading
of
furman,
and
therefore
since
you
are
not
trying
to...
the
military
is
not
trying
to
impose
the
death
penalty
until
after
the
narrowing
promulgation...
the
narrowing
standards
have
been
promulgated,
there's
no
constitutional
defect?
what's...
what
is...
is
there
any
solecism
involved
in
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
was
very
easy
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
is
not
demanding
narrowing.
our
cases
have
demanded
narrowing
based
on
a
constitutional
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
i
guess...
let
me
go
back
to
the
basic.
the
whole
question
is,
do
we
have
to
assume
that
the
statute
ceased
to
exist
for
all
purposes
and
therefore
could
not
have
been
rendered
constitutional
by
a
later
promulgation
of
narrowing
standards,
or
do
we
have
the
option
to
analyze
the
problem
by
saying
the
statute
simply
could
not
be
imposed
until
there
had
been
a
promulgation
of
narrowing
standards?
if
the
latter
analysis
is
open
to
us,
then
the
assumption
of
your
argument
in
fact
is
false
and
you'll
have
to
go
to
a
different
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
depends
on
when
you
can
get
to
rome,
and
on
my
second
analysis
you
can
get
to
rome
later.
on
your
analysis,
you
can't
get
to
rome
until
somebody
builds
a
new
road.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
still
doesn't
get
you
to
intent
and
the
aggravating
factor
isn't
an
element.
how
does
the
rescue
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
limit
it
but
it
doesn't
provide
the
missing
element.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
sufficient?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
triggerman...
that's--
--the
triggerman
can
do
it
accidentally.
that's
still
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
simply
because
narrowing
factors
categorically
limit.
i
mean,
that's
in
a
nutshell.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
any
narrowing...
any
aggravating
factor
should
be
subsumed
in
that
category,
and
if
you
subsume
it
in
that
category,
it
is
in
fact
performing
a
limiting
function.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
reason
i
brought
that
up...
and
i
still
have
some
trouble...
is
because
articles
18
and
is
it
50?
justice
david
h.
souter
56.
you
talk
about
the
president
limiting
the
punishment,
and
i
had
thought
that
was
a
very
strong
argument
for
his
delegation
authority
in
this
case.
but
i'm
having
a
problem
in
that
i
don't
think
that
expanding
the
universe
is
a
limitation.
justice
david
h.
souter
except
that
assuming
furman
applies
to
the
military
and
is
applicable
here,
the
congress
can't
do
that
under
this
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
assuming
the
applicability
of
furman
here,
that
statute
is
not
operative.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
kneedler,
going
back
to
our
earlier
point,
if
i
don't
think
that
the
listing
of
aggravators
is
a
limiting
of
the
sentence,
then
what
is
the
strongest
statutory
authority
that
i
can
cite
for
the
proposition
that
congress
has
delegated
this
power
to
the
president?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
general
rules
and
procedures.
