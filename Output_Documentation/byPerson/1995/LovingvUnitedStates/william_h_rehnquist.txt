we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
94-1966,
dwight
loving
v.
united
states.
mr.
blume.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
court
opinion
in
furman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
furman.
and
there
was
no...
there
were...
to
get
the
majority
in
furman,
there
were
something
like
five
different
opinions
which
didn't
agree
with
one
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
enmund
i
think
supports
your
position
there,
that
you
can't
automatically
transpose
the
mens
rea
for
a
felony
to
a
killing
and
still
have
capital
punishment
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
why
don't
you
proceed
with
the
remaining
parts
of
your
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ex
parte
milligan
didn't
deal
with
any
sort
of
delegation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
also
held
in
a
case
like
curtiss
wright
that
where
the
president
has
independent
authority
in
the
field,
then
delegation
standards
are
much
more
lax.
and
here
the
president...
the
constitution
makes
the
president
commander
in
chief,
so
that
i
think
that
your
argument
may
be
weaker
in
this
area
than
it
might
be
just
in
an
ordinary
context
where
the
president
doesn't
have
independent
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
total--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
a
totally
abstract
approach
to
the
thing.
this
statute
was
never
held
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
did
that
happen?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
had
a
state
that...
where
the
legislature
had
never
defined
any
crimes
and
the
result
was
that
the
common
law
crimes
simply
evolved
through
the
decisions
of
its
highest
court?
you're
saying
that
the
highest
court
of
a
state
couldn't
say
if
the
crime
had
the
elements
that
we
said
was
necessary
to
meet
the
eighth
amendment.
it
couldn't
be
promulgated
by
the
highest
court
rather
than
the
legislature?
that's
a
very
strange--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
answer
the
question,
mr.
blume.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
kneedler,
supposing
that
the
president
had
never
promulgated
these
regulations,
but
that
the
military
trial
court
judge
had
simply
instructed,
simply
perhaps
making
them
up
or
looking
at
cases
and
saying
i
think
we
need
these,
would
the
defendant
have
standing
to
object
that
they
had
not
been
promulgated
by
either
congress
or
the
president?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
were
all
beneficial
to
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
your...
the
basic
introduction
to
the
statute
says
unlawfully
kills.
it
doesn't
just
say
kills.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
say
that
it's
ameliorative
is
a
little
bit
playing
with
words
i
think
because
without
these
regulations
issued
by
the
president,
nobody
could
have
been
sentenced
to
death.
with
the
regulations
issued
by
the
president,
if
they're
valid,
people
can
be
sentenced
to
death.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
still
think
there's
a
problem.
are
you...
you're
not
saying,
are
you,
that
the
president...
if
the
president
promulgates
five
aggravating
circumstances,
that's
somewhat
ameliorating,
but
if
he
promulgates
15
aggravating
circumstances,
that's
even
more
ameliorating?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
