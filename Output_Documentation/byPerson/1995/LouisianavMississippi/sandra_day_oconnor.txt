justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
assume
very
few
of
those
have
been
patented
to
owners
like
this.
you're
talking
about
an
area
here
where
land
patents
have
been
issued,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
there
is
a
series
of
maps
that
were
put
in
evidence
in
this
case,
i
assume
by
mississippi,
and
each
one
has
fixed
markers.
you
can
lay
one
on
top
of
another,
and
see
at
each
map
just
where
this
disputed
area
has
shifted
a
little
bit
or
grown,
or
changed,
and
where
the
river
has
changed,
and
if
you
lay
each
one
on
top
of
the
other,
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
see
the
disputed
area
that
has
shifted
somewhat
through
the
years,
grown,
changed
in
shape
with
movement
of
the
river,
but
nonetheless
traceable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
come
away
at
the
end
thinking,
well,
here
is
this
piece
of
land
that
was
patented,
and
it
shift
and
changed
through
the
years,
but
it's
identifiable.
now,
is
there
not
such
evidence
available
that
the
master
looked
at
and
apparently
relied
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
wish
you
had,
too,
because
it
sounds
like
something
like
a
giant
shell
game
in
the
river,
now
you
see
it,
now
you
don't,
and
no,
it's...
the
island's
up
here
6
miles
away.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
you
on
this
boat
trip?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
there
a
part
of
the
disputed
area
that
was
above
the
waterline
on
that
boat
trip,
or
was
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
couldn't
see
it
in
the
distance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
acknowledge
that
at
times
the
island
is
completely
submerged--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
river?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
we
look
at
the
high
water
mark
or
the
low
water
mark?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
that
definition?
