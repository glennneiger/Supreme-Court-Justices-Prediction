justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
hear
argument
in
number
121
original,
louisiana
v.
mississippi.
mr.
keyser,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
the
river
never
found
its
main
course?
are
you
saying
the
thalweg
was
never
west
of
the
island?
justice
john
paul
stevens
stack
island.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
the
thalweg
was
never
west
of
that
island?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
keyser,
can
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
in
response
to
questions
from
justice
breyer,
you
said
the
island
was
totally
submerged
for
3
or
4
months
in
several
years.
would
it
not
also
be
true
that
for
8
or
9
months
it
was
visible
and
above
the
level
of
the
water?
doesn't
the
water
level
rise
or
fall
rather
dramatically
in
the
mississippi?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
your
view,
how
long
does
it
have
to
be
submerged
before
it
ceases
being
an
island?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i...
you're
not
denying...
you're
not
saying
it
was
never
above
high
water.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
as
to
be
above
high
water.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
for
what
period
of
year,
in
your
view
of
the
evidence,
was
the
island
totally
submerged,
in
a
typical
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
would
be
above
water
more
often
than
it
would
be
submerged.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
mccartney.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
above
high
water,
what
do
you
mean?
above
high
water
6
months
out
of
the
year,
9
months,
12
months...
what
do
you
mean
by
above
high
water?
justice
john
paul
stevens
permanently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
disagree
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
your
opponent's
statement
that
for
several
months
each
year
it
was
40
feet
below
high
water.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
further
position
is
that
even
if
there
were
a
total
flood,
i
mean,
you
can
flood
a
whole
long
area,
it
doesn't
cease
being
land.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
map
does
show
a
channel
of
the
river
going
right
over
the
island,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
mccartney,
what
is
your
view
of
our
duty
to
give
deference
to
the
master's
findings
of
fact?
are
we
supposed
to
look
at
the
case
de
novo,
or
are
we
supposed
to
give
some
deference
to
him?
what's
the
law
on
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
mccartney.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bailess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bayless,
what
is
the
difference
in
altitude
between
the
ordinary
high
water
mark
and
the
zero
gauge
level
on
the
mississippi
river?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
now,
on
your...
when
you
talk
about
the
land
being
visible,
are
you
talking
about
there
being
enough
land
above
the
ordinary
high
water
mark,
or
enough
land
above
the
zero
gauge,
when
you
try
to
define
the
island?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
which
is
the
significant
standard
for
us
to
look
at,
zero
gauge,
or
high
water
mark?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
standard
low
water
the
same
as
zero
gauge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
standard
low
water
the
same
as
zero
gauge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
be
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
now,
there
are
levees
in
this
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
high
are
the...
what
is
the
top
of
the
levees,
how
high
above
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
your
moment
for
reviewing
your
notes
has
just
expired.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
keyser,
you
have
a
little
over
a
minute
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
will
be
submitted.
