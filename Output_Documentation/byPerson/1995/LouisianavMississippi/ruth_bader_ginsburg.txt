mr.
keyser,
i'm
confused
on
that
point,
because
i
thought
that
dr.
easterly
testified
in
answer...
there's
this
colloquy
in
the
third
supplemental
transcript
at
315,
313
to
15.
he's
asked
the
question,
so
the
logical
conclusion,
then,
is
that
the
boundary
thalweg
was
west
of
stack
island
at
its
formation,
and
the
answer
is,
that
is
correct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
you
do
concede...
that
was
the
dr.
easterly
testimony
that
i
read,
that
the
boundary
thalweg
was
west
of
stack
island
at
its
formation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
have
just
gone
through
that
if
this
stack
island
continued
in
existence,
then
the
boundary
was
west
of
stack
island
at
the
island's
formation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
boundary
thalweg,
unless
stack
island
is
washed
away,
will
remain
west
of
stack
island
for
all
times,
unless
it
is
eroded
away,
and
dr.
easterly
confirmed
that
that
was
correct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he
was
referring
to
stack
island.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
your
view,
when
did
this
disputed
area
form?
you
said
it's
not
the
same
as
this
stack
island
in
origin.
we
have...
the
disputed
area
is
formed
much
more
recently,
and
when
do
you
date
it
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
position
is,
it's
1930,
or
it's
not
1930,
when
is
it?
i'm
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bayless,
in
a
case
like
this,
does
either
side
have
a
burden
of
proof?
