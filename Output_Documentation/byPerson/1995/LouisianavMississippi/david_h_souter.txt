justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
we
speak
just
in
neutral
terms
about
disputed
territory,
that
will
take
care
of
that
confusion,
won't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
said
in
your
brief,
i
believe,
that
the
line
as
the
master
has
recommended
that
it
be
drawn
now
cuts
through
property
which
has
been
owned
and
farmed
by
louisiana
residents
since
i
think
the
beginning
of
this
century,
and
that
statement
was
simply
hotly
disputed
in
mississippi's
brief
as
being
a
factual
misstatement.
could
you
either
now,
or
if
you
can't
do
it
at
this
moment,
perhaps
by
a
letter
to
the
clerk
after
the
argument
is
over,
point
me
to
sort
of
the
exact
places
in
the
transcript,
or
the
other
evidence
which
supports
that
statement
of
yours?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
is
there
any
other
evidence
in
the
record
that
you
would
point
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
none
of
that
indicates
that
a
louisiana
family
was
farming
the
land
since
1900,
and
i
take
it
it's
the
surles'
testimony
and
that
alone
that
you
point
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
this
isn't
stack
island,
isn't
that
what
causes
all
of
this
confusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
we
accept
the
master's
reasoning
that
in
fact
you
can
trace
the...
i'll
call
it
the
migration
of
this
piece
of
land,
whatever
it's
supposed
to
be
called,
from
the
stack
island
which
was
east
of
the
boundary
thalweg
originally
to
the
disputed
area
now,
then
your
argument
falls.
if
we
accept
his
reasoning
for
the
identity
of
this
land,
then
that's
the
end
of
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
keyser,
when
you
say
that
it
washed
away,
do
you
mean
that
there
was
on
the
surface
of
the
river
at
that
point
no
land
showing,
or
do
you
mean
that
the
level
of
the
island
in
relation
to
the
adjacent
river
banks
dropped
sufficiently
low
so
that
by
the
legal
definition
you
employ
it
was
not
an
island
even
though
there
was
visible
land
of
some
sort
there,
whatever
you
might
call
it?
do
you
mean
that
literally
there
was
nothing
above
the
surface
of
the
water,
or
there
was
something
above
the
surface,
but
it
wasn't
high
enough
to
be
called
an
island?
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
there
also
testimony
that
with
respect
to
that
time
a
given
family
was
continuously
farming
the
land,
so
that
with
respect
to
that,
wasn't
there
disputed
testimony?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
isn't
that
what
their
affidavit
said?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't
the
master
entitled
to
accept
the
affidavit?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
somebody
says,
there's
nothing
there,
and
somebody
else
says,
we
were
farming
that
land
there
at
that
time,
the
master
can't
have
it
both
ways.
he's
got
to
choose
one
or
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
he
chooses
yours,
they're
going
to
say,
oh,
gee...
the
other
side
is
going
to
say,
you've
got
to
show
common
sense,
and
if
he
chooses
the
other
side's
testimony,
that's
what
you're
saying.
but
he's
got
to
take
one
or
the
other,
and
why
would
we
go
behind
his
factual
resolution?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know,
but
if
you
want
to
say
it's
a
choice
between
whether
you're
going
to
accept
the
testimony
of
farmers
who
said
they
were
farming,
and
a
government
agency
that
drew
a
map,
i
don't
see
anything
irrational
about
saying
i'm
going
to
go
with
the
farmers.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
farmers
say
no,
we
were
farming
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
weren't
farming
in
hope.
i
mean,
you're
not
plowing
in
water.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
somebody
could
always
lie
in
testimony,
that's
true.
somebody
can
always
can
make
a
mistake.
but
the
point
of
a
factfinder,
in
this
case
the
master,
is
in
effect
to
make
the
best
choice
he
can,
and
the
master
in
this
case
chose
the
affidavit
of
the
farmers.
what
is
irrational
about
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know,
but
i'm
concerned
about
1883,
and
the
master--
justice
david
h.
souter
--took
the
testimony
of
the
farmers,
and
i
still
don't
know
why
it's
irrational.
justice
david
h.
souter
took
the
affidavit
of
the
farmers.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
like
the
nile
valley.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back,
then,
to
my
earlier
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
part
of
your
argument,
if
not
your
case,
then,
rests
on
your
claim
that
this
is
not
an
island
because
it
is
not
high
enough
in
relation
to
the
banks
of
the
river
to
be
called
an
island.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
that
for
that
reason,
even
though
during
some
parts
of
the
year
there's
land
here,
and
indeed
there's
enough
land
to
have
trees,
the
tops
of
which
look
like
a
forest,
it's
still
not
an
island,
and
the
island
rule,
or
the
island
exception,
rather,
does
not
apply.
that's
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
you
in
effect
then
are
saying
that
the
island
exception
should
not
apply
to
anything
that
does
not...
any
body
of
land
sometime
above
the
river,
which
sometime
is
located
above
the
surface
of
the
river,
which
is
not...
i
forget
what
the
rule
is,
as
high
as
the
banks,
or
something
like
that.
why
in
the
world
would
we
want
a
different
rule
for
low-lying
land,
let's
say,
that
is
a
foot
or
6
feet
below
the
banks
from
the
rule
that
we
would
apply
to
an
island
as
you
would
define
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
island
disappeared
in
the
meantime?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
that
as
between
map
a,
b,
and
c
in
the
interstitial
period
between
a
and
b
and
b
and
c,
that
the
body
of
land
disappeared?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
just
happened
to
get
there
at
the
fortunate
moments
when
it
was
appearing,
and
they
never
bothered
to
map
during
those
periods
when
it
had
sunk?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that's
not
a
believable
proposition.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
that
gets
us...
all
right,
then
that
gets
us
back
to
the
claim
of
whether
it
is
or
is
not
an
island
by
legal
definition,
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
continuity,
which
justice
o'connor
raised
with
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
keyser,
going
back
perhaps
more
specifically
to
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
raised
with
you,
in
leaving
aside
for
the
moment
the
question
of
how
we're
going
to
define
the
island...
let's
just
refer
to
it
in
a
generic...
to
the
disputed
area
in
a
generic
way.
the
yellow
brief
on
page
30
contains
the
statement
that
65
percent
of
the
island
as
shown
on
the
map
in
1882
was
still
in
place,
in
the
same
place
as
shown
on
a
map
in
1937.
is
that
statement
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
long
was
the
island?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
how
long
is
it,
i
mean
in
relation
to
6...
you're
saying
it
was
6
miles
apart,
it
couldn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
statement
couldn't
be
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
where
were
you
all
when
you
were
in
the
boat?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
mr.
mccartney,
i
just
wanted
to
get
straight
on
what
you
saw
out
on
the
boat.
[laughter]
i
take
it
that
part
of
this
land
mass
was
flooded.
there
was
water
over
the
soil,
but
i
gather
from
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
part
of
it
was
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
there
was
still
some
dry
land
somewhere.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
edges
of
the
island
got
flooded,
but
the
center
of
the
island
didn't,
is
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
the
scoured
clean
map
i
think
you
were
referring
to,
or
one
of
the
briefs
referred
to
as
the
lunch
map?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
get
specific
about
that
with
a
question
that
i
raised
with
mr.
keyser?
why,
then...
can
you
explain
why
we
have
such
a
clear
dispute
over
the
proposition
which
was
in
your
yellow
brief
that
35...
i'm
sorry,
65
percent
of
the
island
as
shown
in
1882
was
still
shown
in
the
same
place
in
1937?
how
do...
one
of
the
things
that's
puzzling
me
is
how
we
can
have,
definitional
problems
aside,
such
a
clear
contradiction
about
matters
of
evidentiary
fact.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
your
comment
on
mr.
keyser's
statement
that
the
island...
or
the
land
masses
were
6
miles
apart,
and
for
that
reason,
given
their
sizes,
there
could
not
have
been
such
an
overlap?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
6
miles
away
on
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
do
you
stand
by
the
statement
which
you
attribute
to
the
witness
for
the
other
side
that
there
was
this
65
percent
identity
over
time
between
1882
and
1937?
do
you
think
that
statement
is
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
adopted
it
in
your
brief.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
so
if
i
take
the
1882
map
and
the
1937
map,
and
i
overlay
them
on
my
light
table,
am
i
going
to
see
something
like
a
65
percent
overlay
of
the
land
mass?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--did
i
understand
you
to
say
earlier
that
even
accepting
the
other
side's
definition
of
an
island
as
requiring
land
equal
to
or
above,
what
is
it,
top--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
that
stack
island
would
qualify?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
qualified
in
1881?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
do
i
also
understand...
you
didn't
say
this
explicitly,
but
i
took
this
as
implied,
and
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
you.
did
you
also
mean
to
say
that
if
the
entire
island
were
flooded
today,
at
a
time
of
high
flooding,
that
that
would...
that
it's
condition
would
simply
be
what
the
land
on
the
bank
of
the
river
would
be
if
there
were
not
levees
there,
that
the
island
would
be
no
more
flooded
than
the
adjacent
bank
lands
would
be
flooded?
justice
david
h.
souter
am
i
correct
that
there
has
never
been
any
dispute
in
this
litigation
that
at
the
time
of
the
original
patent...
which
was
what,
1881,
i
think?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
at
the
time
of
the
survey
patent,
that
stack
island,
the
land
mass
so-called
at
that
time,
was
an
island
by
legal
definition.
that
has
never
been
contested,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
going
to
say,
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that
issue
on
your
theory,
because
there
is
at
least
an
evidentiary
basis
for
viewing
the
facts
as
the
master
viewed
them,
so
you
don't
want
us
to
get
into
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
had
a
second
case...
smith
v.
lattig,
and
you
were
going
to
refer
us
to
a
second
case.
