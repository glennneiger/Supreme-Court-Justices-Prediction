mr.
gary
l.
keyser
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
louisiana's
circumstances
here
today
are
decidedly
less
happy
than
they
were
3
years
ago
in
november
of
1992,
when
we
were
here
on
the
same
case.
since
that
time,
we
have
had
an
opportunity
to
supplement
the
trial
record
from
the
federal
district
court
in
vicksburg
with
more
than
200
additional
exhibits
and
more
than
a
dozen
new
witnesses
who
have
augmented
the
trial
testimony
and
we
believe
clarified
it
perfectly
well.
unfortunately,
the
reason
we're
here
is
because
we
filed
exceptions
to
the
report
of
the
special
master
which
has
essentially
tracked
the
district
court,
which
was
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
favor
of
louisiana.
we
hope
to
persuade
the
court
that
louisiana,
like
all
other
states,
is
entitled
to
some
river
frontage,
to
some
access
to
navigation,
and
that
there
should
not
be
an
interstate
boundary
along
our
levee
and
along
the
bank
of
the
river
at
lake
providence,
louisiana,
where
the
river
never
found
its
main
course.
in
order
for
a
boundary
to
be
drawn
there,
as
mr.
austin
smith
contends--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--when
you
say
island,
justice
stevens--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--well,
the
original
stack
island
of
1881
was
6
miles
northeast
of
that
location.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
the
boundary
is
sought
to
be
drawn--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--yes,
sir.
mr.
brien
winkley,
the
chief
hydrologist
for
the
corps
of
engineers,
said
it
was
never
there,
and
he
produced
all
hydrographic
surveys
for
all
known
periods
of
time
to
show
where
the
thalweg
was
every
year,
and
those
hydrographic
surveys
were
introduced
into
evidence,
carefully
explained
by
mr.
brien
winkley,
by
mr.
mike
mayeux,
a
professional
land
surveyor,
and
by
dr.
ernie
easterly,
who
is
a
forensic
geographic
and
fluvial
geomorphologist.
all
of
them
tracked
the
deepest
geologic
thalweg
of
the
river,
the
downstream
track
of
navigation
for
all
periods
of
time,
and
none
of
them
could
find
that
the
river
was
ever
on
the
mississippi
levee,
on
the
railroad
tracks,
across
the
property
of
mr.
surles
and
mr.
house,
or
even
across
the
lake
providence
port
commission
property,
where
mr.
smith
drew
his
boundary
line.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
yes.
the
answer
there
refers
to
the
northeast
position
of
the
original
position
of
stack
island
in
1881.
that's
6
miles,
5
to
6
miles
northeast
of
the
louisiana
levee.
that's
why
there's
so
much
confusion
in
this
record.
you
can
never
understand
from
one
minute
to
the
next
which
area
you're
talking
about
unless
you
do
it
by
latitude
and
longitude.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
or
the
disputed
areas,
sometimes
referred
to
the
accretion
along
the
west
bank
at
lake
providence.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
one
place
you
would
want
to
look
is
to
the
testimony
of
albert
surles,
who
adjoins
the
property
of
mr.
sam
house,
who
is
the
sheriff
of
that
parish.
mr.
surles'
father
bought
the
property
in
1925,
and
he
testified
that
the
accretion
which
attached
to
his
property
he
had
leased
out
to
another
louisiana
witness,
lonnie
styron,
and
lonnie
styron
was
then
at
that
moment,
when
he
was
testifying,
forming
that
property.
now,
that
accretion
was
not,
i
don't
believe,
formed
by
mr.
surles'
dad,
but
rather
by
mr.
surles
himself,
and
mr.
styron.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
can't
think
of
anything,
except
robert...
you
have
to
recall
that
mississippi
really
only
had
two
witnesses,
austin
smith,
who
is
their
expert,
and
robert
jarvis,
who
is
the
grandson
of
the
houston
family.
mr.
jarvis'
testimony
was
from
an
aerial
photograph
in
which
he
drew
a
blue
ink
pen
line
across
the
same
property
and
said
that
was
the
property
of
the
houstons.
well,
that's
the
surles,
house,
delony,
shorter
property.
actually,
the
line
that
robert
jarvis
drew
is
more
westerly
than
the
line
that
austin
smith
drew.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
yes,
sir,
and
you'll
see
in
the
testimony
there
that
there...
in
fact,
the
lease
was
introduced:
to
evidence.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
thank
you.
so
we're
hoping
to
get
some
kind
of
river
frontage
and
some
access
to
navigation.
on
the
subject
of
mississippi's
expert
witness,
this
is
the
same
man--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--no,
sir.
i
think
that's
true.
it
depends
in
any
year,
any
given
point
in
time,
when
you
make
a
statement,
whether
or
not
it's
true,
because
it
changes
all
the
time,
but--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--it
was
west
of
stack
island
before
the
new
madrid
earthquake
washed
the
island
away
in
1811,
and
it
was
west
of
stack
island...
another
problem--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--certainly.
that
is
correct.
what
the
disputed
area
is
is
not
stack
island.
the
originally
island
was--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--that's
correct.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
in
1811
or
prior
years,
not
at
1994,
1995--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--dr.
easterly's
not
referring
to
the
louisiana
levee.
he's
referring
to
the
mississippi
area
6
miles
northeast
of
the
area
of
the
dispute.
i'd
have
to
reread
the
testimony
you're
reading
to
make
absolutely
sure,
but
i'm
quite
confident
that's
what
he
meant.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
that's
correct,
but
he's
not
referring
to
lake
providence,
he's
referring
to
mayersville,
mississippi.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
no.
i
think
that
colloquy
is
about
where
the
location
of
the
original
island
is
and
all
of
the
exhibits
depicted
in
black
at
a
latitude
reference...
he's
referring
to,
if
the
island
is
washed
away...
i
think
they're
talking
about
the
island
rule
there,
but
i
would
have
to
go
back
and
reread
it.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
correct.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
agree
with--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
that's
exactly
what--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--let
me
explain
what
that
problem
is
there.
the
special
master
misconstrued
mississippi's
only
third
witness,
the
forester,
mr.
burkhardt.
mr.
burkhardt
was
testifying
about
an
1867
merriweather
map
which
showed
the
island
accreted
to
the
mississippi
shore
at
that
time,
and
it
did
have
tall
trees.
as
austin
smith
testified,
that
island
was
completely
washed
away
and
washed
downstream.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
think
that
was
a
survey--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--about
what?
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
one
of
the
best
things...
quickest
handles
you
can
get
on
that
is
to
look
at
dr.
easterly's
testimony.
he
explains
the
origin
of
the
island,
when
it
was
washed
away
by
the
new
madrid
earthquake,
and
attached
to
his
prepared
testimony
in
the
supplemental
trial
is
what's
called
the
cartographic
analysis.
it
tells
you
for
every
year
whether
the
island
or
any
bar
or
shoal
formation
loosely
called
stack
island
was
in
existence,
and
you
will
see
that
it
appeared
and
disappeared
and
reappeared,
as
did
island
number
7,
below
lake
providence,
and
an
agglomeration
of
bars
and
shoals
which
appear
and
reappear
throughout
this
reach
of
the
river.
but
the
location
known
as
island
number
94,
and
after
it
was
washed
away
in
1883
it
became
stack
island,
and
it
was
washed
away
in
1910
to
1915,
became
bars
and
shoals
and
an
agglomeration
of
low-level
accretionary
features,
washed
away
again
in
1948,
and
now
it's
there
in
its
full
glory
at
its
original
location
as
a
true
island
known
as
stack
island
near
mayersville,
6
miles
from
lake
providence,
and
what
is
below
on
the
louisiana
bank
is
nothing
more
than
bank
accretion.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
both
of
those
are
true,
both
of
those
statements.
in
1883,
during
a
flood
period,
the
river
totally
scoured
the
island
away,
and
as
dr.
winkley
testified,
there
was
a
30-feet
scoured
channel
right
through
the
island.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
they
filed
affidavits...
the
island
was
surveyed--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--correct.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
think
he
has
to
do
so
with
a
common
sense
comprehension
of
what
was
going
on
at
the
time.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
that's
true.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
why
would
the
u.s.
army
corps
of
engineers
draw
hydrographic
surveys
that
showed
scour
pools
at
the
location
of
the
island?
stephen
b.
blackwell
has
family
who
are
in
an
ongoing
effort
to
achieve
a
patent--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--well,
the
island
was
surveyed
in
1881,
but
it
washed
away
in
1883.
no
one--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--well,
in
the
hope
that
it
would
come
back,
which
it
did.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
they
may
not
have
been
accurately
providing
affidavit
for
the
general
land
office--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--with
an
island
elevation
of
20
feet
and
a
water
elevation
of
50
feet,
one
might
doubt
the
veracity
of
an
affidavit
that
says
there
was
an
ongoing
farming
operation
continuously
from
year
to
year.
it
would
be
under
30
feet
of
water,
as
the
master
saw
himself
on
may
5,
1994.
when
he
went
with
us
in
a
boat
to
the
disputed
area,
he
found
46
feet
of
water
and
an
island...
not
an
island,
an
accreted
ball
formation
on
the
louisiana
bank
30
feet
of
water.
now,
is
that
an
island?
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
well,
that's--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--well,
he
didn't
take
the
testimony
of
the
farmers.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
he
took...
there
was
an
affidavit
filed
in
an
effort
to
kill
a
fault
in
a
patent
application,
was
what
that
was
about.
but
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
hydrographic
surveys,
it's
not
reasonably
likely
that
a
farmer
could
have
farmed
30
feet
under
water,
and
that's
the
long
and
the
short
of
it.
that
is
a
legitimate
concern.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
corps
of
engineers
chief
hydrologist,
it
started
forming
in
the
1930's.
according
to
albert
surles,
who
lived
there,
i
think,
thirties,
forties,
and
fifties,
it
was
a
gradual
process
of
building
accretion
to
the
bank,
and
you
can
see
it
from
the
hydrographic
surveys,
and
mr.
surles
testified
about
it,
and
in
fact
in
the
first--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--it's
a
gradual
process
of
building
on
a
river
bank.
the
accretion
forms
more
and
more,
year
after
year,
unless,
of
course,
it's
washed
away,
and
that's
what
dr.
winkley
testified
had
happened
here.
as
the
island
to
the
northeast
is
being
washed
away,
sediment
is
being
deposited
on
the
louisiana
bank
at
lake
providence,
so
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
features,
two
separate
and
distinct
times
and
places
building
and
eroding
independently
of
one
another.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
every
year.
it's--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--during
high
water.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
it
would
depend
on
the
melting
of
the
snow
up
north.
it
would
commence
probably
in
march,
april,
may,
june.
it
varies
from
year
to
year.
sometimes
there
are
periods
of
extreme
high
water
even
very
late
in
the
summer.
in
fact--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--yes,
or
longer.
this
entire
crew
here
was
in
a
boat
on
september
5,
1994,
and
the
water
elevation
was
46
feet.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
major
treetops.
it
was
like
driving
through
a
forest.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
depending
on
the
water
elevation.
i'm
not
sure
what
it
is
right
now.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
would
imagine
if
conditions
today
on
october
2nd
or
3rd--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--that
is
the
nature
of
the
river.
it
goes--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
it
may
be
longer
than
3
or
4
months.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
it
could
be
shorter.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
correct.
the
water
elevation
varies
as
much
as
the
height
of
this
building.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
correct.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
yes.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
it
wouldn't
apply
to
this--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--if
you
attempt
to
take
into
account
every
bar
and
shoal,
and
if
each
one
of
those
can
represent
the
legal
character
of
an
island,
you'll
have
a
thousand
boundaries.
they're
constantly
forming
and
being
washed
away,
so
you'd
be
faced
with
trying
to
draw
frozen
thalwegs
and
active
thalwegs,
or
different
boundaries
every
time
you
found
a
bar
or
shoal,
of
which
there
are
thousands
in
any
one
mile
of
the
river.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
not
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
at
lake
providence.
only
patents
for
uplands
fastlands
to
the
riparians
at
the
time
of
state
sovereignty.
what
has
accumulated
as
accretion
to
the
bank
has
never
been
patented
out.
it
is
just
attached.
the
only
thing
that
was
ever
patented
was
the
northeast
mayersville,
mississippi
location.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
yes.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
he
did
look
at
it,
and
apparently
did
rely
upon
it,
and
that
technique
is
the
subject
of
a
book.
it's
called,
"how
maps
lie".
it's
no
different
than
taking
aerial
photographs
of
a
car
on
an
interstate,
and
you
take
the
picture
every
day,
and
you
say,
see,
the
car
is
always
right
in
that
same
place.
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
those
maps
are
nothing
more--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--dr.
winkley
said--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--from
year
to
year
it
did.
it
was
washed
away.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
those
maps
are--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--those
maps
are
at
low
water.
they're
below
the
ordinary
low
water
elevation.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
well,
dr.
winkley
addressed
the
question
of
the
whole
thing
being
scoured
away.
he
gave
us
the
dates.
he
gave
us
the
maps.
they're
all
in
evidence.
it
shows
that
the
bottom
form
of
the
river
was
completely
devoid
of
some
of
those
very
formations
you
make
reference
to,
and
he
explained
that
in
his
predicate
testimony
for
what
he
would
talk
about,
then
he
explained
it
specifically
with
regard
to
each
map.
now,
sometimes
there
is
a
low-lying
bar
or
shoal
growing
up...
as
the
ancient
writers
used
to
say,
fast
growing
up
to
be
an
island
covered
with
willows,
maybe
a
new
crow's
nest
island,
words
to
that
effect,
but
it--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--yes,
it
does,
the
series--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--that
justice
o'connor
referred
to.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
well,
we
had
four.
we
had--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--yes,
sir.
we
had--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--we
had
hatley
harrison
in
the
first
trial,
mike
mayeux,
the
surveyor,
dr.
winkley,
the
corps'
hydrologist,
and
dr.
easterly.
all
of
them
talked
about
each
of
the
maps.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
correct.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
it
has
to
be
above
ordinary
high
water
to
be
an
island
at
any
time.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
dr.
winkley
said
there
has
been
no
island
in
the
river
above
high
water
for
any
recorded
period
of
history.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
ordinary
high
water.
now,
when
that
water
goes
down,
you
can
see
something.
you
can
walk
on
it.
that's
why
they
deer-hunted.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
well,
it
would
be
submerged
from
after
the...
i
mean,
it
would
be
emergent
from
after
the
spring
floods,
generally
through
the
summer,
to
february,
march,
april
the
next
year.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
it's
hard
to
say
because
of
the
way
the
water
in
the
river
is.
we'd...
it...
actually
it
varies
tremendously
from
year
to
year.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
once
an
island
is
above
ordinary
high
water,
it
is
a
fixed
place.
it's
fastland.
it
has
permanent
character.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
well,
yes,
if
it--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--ordinary
high
water--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--ordinary
high
water
may
be
in
the
vicinity
of
36
to
38,
40
feet.
what
exists
for
whatever
period
of
time,
and
if
the
island
were...
whatever
portion
of
a
bottom
feature
was
above
that
elevation
would
be
the
island
part,
not
the
part
below
it,
like
hawaii
or
somewhere.
only
the
part
above
the
water
is
the
island,
not
the
part
below
it,
so
if
it's
above
the
water,
that
part
qualifies
as
an
island,
not
the
bars
and
shoals
that
surround
it.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
there's
no
rule
on
that
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
i
would
have
to
think
it
would
have
to
be
somewhat
more
emergent
and
more
permanent
in
character
and
use
than
that,
but--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--i
would
think
it
should
be,
but
i've
never
seen
a
situation
where
there
was
only...
if
you
only
had
1
day
of
ordinary
high
water,
it
might
qualify,
but
that's
not
the
case.
that
never
happens.
it's
months
at
a
time,
generally.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
that's
totally
incorrect.
it's
not
possible
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
those
are
in
two
different
geographic
locations.
they're
6
miles
apart.
there's
no
way
that--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--along
the
lake
providence
bank
in
louisiana.
it
is
the
bank
accretion,
and
it
goes
from
the
town
of
lake
providence
5
or
6--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--oh,
no,
no--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--yes,
i
see
what
you're
getting
at.
the
original
island
first
referred
to
is
117
acres,
so
it
might
be
500
feet
long,
1,000
feet
long,
over
against
mayersville,
mississippi.
the
other
accretion
against
louisiana
is
just
that,
it's
in
a
remote
location,
so
the
two
can't
coexist...
well,
there's
a
new
island
in
the
original
location,
so
they
do
now,
but
they
couldn't
along
the
lines
of
what
you're
suggesting.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
thank
you.
first,
i'd
like
to
address
the
question
of
where
the
book
definitions
come
from.
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
we
tell
you
where
three
of
them
come
from,
from
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
survey,
the
department
of
the
interior,
and
the
corps
of
engineers.
on
page
19
we
cite
the
government
land
office
book
manual
of
instruction
for
the
survey
of
public
lands,
where
the
government
surveyors
were
given
the
same
definition
used
by
the
coast
and
geodetic
survey
and
the
other
government
agencies
which
follow
the
hague
convention
of
1938
and
the
geneva
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
contiguous
zone.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
a
body
of
land
entirely
surrounded
by
water
at
ordinary
high
water.
that's
used
in
international
practice,
domestic
practice
on
the
rivers,
u.s.
v.
california,
u.s.
v.
louisiana,
all--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--that
is
the--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--except
that
top
bank
is
the
same
as
ordinary
high
water.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
no.
no,
it
doesn't.
i
can
explain
that,
but
it
doesn't.
