justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
i
have
this
mixed
up,
but
i
didn't
think
it
was
that
complicated,
so
probably
i
do
have
it
mixed
up,
but
i
thought
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
place
called
stack
island
that
used
to
be
part
of
mississippi,
and
there
was
a
big
river
that
flowed
to
the
west
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
that
big
river
that
flowed
to
the
west
of
it
began
to
change
its
channel
and
began
to
flow
towards
the
east
of
it,
and
the
law
is
that
if
the
river
changes
like
that,
that
stack
island
still
stays
part
of
mississippi.
but
of
course,
if
it
really
isn't
one
island,
if
really
the
island
disappeared
and
then
reemerged
later
on,
when
the
river
was
flowing
to
the
east,
then
it's
part
of
louisiana.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
all
arguing
about
whether
this
was
one
island
called
stack
island,
which
has
always
existed,
but
the
river
changed
course,
or
that
there
are
three
or
four
or
five
islands
that
keep
coming
back
and
forth
and
disappearing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
correct,
then
looking
through
this,
it
seemed
to
me
they
made
an
awfully
good
case
that
there
was
just
one
island,
because
they
trace
it
through
on
all
the
maps,
and
then
they
show
that
there
were
cottonwood
trees
there
that
are
about
100
years
old,
or
80
years
old
or
something,
and
they're
still
there,
and
it's
pretty
hard
to
see
how
all
these
trees
could
have
grown
on
this
island
that
was
popping
in
and
popping
out,
and
you
have
some
other
evidence,
but
what
is
it,
because
i
haven't
found
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
thing
i
found
on
your
side,
or
my
clerk
found
so
far
was
that
one
of
these
maps,
which
always
talks
about
stack
island,
had
at
one
point
marked
through
it
a
thing
that
said
river,
or
channel,
and
if
you
assume
there
were
50
yards
on
either
side
or
something
it
must
go
through...
do
you
know
what
i'm
thinking
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right.
but
aside
from
that,
is
there
any
other
evidence
in
your
favor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
shows
this
island
was
popping
in
and
out
instead
of
just
being
one
island.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
there
is...
if
i
go
to
the
place...
what's...
it's
not
a
trick.
i'm
using
the
words
stack
island
to
refer
to
what
mississippi
and
the
special
master
were
referring
as
stack
island,
so
i'm
not
trying
to
catch
you
in
any
kind
of
linguistic
difficulty.
i
mean,
you're
saying
that
this
place
that
the
master
and
everybody
is
talking
about
as
stack
island,
which
from
reading
the
master's
reports
had
trees
all
over
it,
cottonwood
trees,
that
you
all
went
out
there,
and
there
was
nothing
but
water,
and
that
down
below
the
water
level,
40
feet
below
was
this
place
they're
calling
stack
island
with,
what,
some
trees,
branches,
poking
out
the
top?
is
that
what
it
looked
like?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
if
we
go
there
right
now,
there
is
no
land.
it's
40
feet
under
the
water.
is
that
what
you're
telling
me?
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
no,
is
it
that
there
is
no
land
there
at
all,
it's
below
the
water,
like
feet,
many,
many
feet
below?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
all
the
witnesses
agreed,
everybody
said...
i
didn't
get
that
from
the
report...
they
all
went
out
to
this
place
of
what
they're
calling
stack
island,
and
there's
no
land,
it's
just
water
3
or
4
months
a
year?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is...
am
i
right
in
saying
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
is
no
land
there,
there
is
just
water
3
or
4
months
every
year,
is
that
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
not
shorter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
where
was...
that
what
was
mixing
me
up.
as
i
read
these
and
i
had
my
law
clerk
check
into
it,
i
did
think
there
was
an
awful
lot
of
evidence
this
is
one
place,
and
there
are
big
poplar
trees
80
feet
around
or
something,
or
they're
very,
very
broad,
big
trees.
i
don't
know
how
you
could
plant
these
trees
if
it's
underwater
all
the
time.
but
he
just
said
you
went
out
on
a
boat,
and
there
you
were,
sailing
over
the
island
40
feet
below
you
under
the
water.
what
happened
on
that
boat?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
some
book
that
has...
just
as
a
matter
of
law
that
has
this
thing
about
top
bank
in
it?
i
mean,
it's
making
me
a
little
nervous.
i
think
there
are
some
rivers
that
have
very
high
banks,
like
the
cliffs
of
dover,
or
something,
and
it
would
seem
amazing
to
me
that
if
you
have
a
little
island
in
the
middle
of
a
river
with
thousand-foot
banks
on
it,
that
suddenly
people
start
saying
it
isn't
an
island,
but
i
mean,
is
there
some
legal
reference
where
they
explain
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
the
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--aside
from
this,
if
we're
going
to
state
a
proposition
of
law
in
some
of
these
opinions,
i
would
like
it,
you
know,
to
be
accurate.
the
thing
i
want
to
know,
where
do
i
look
this
up?
where
does
it
say?
it
doesn't
seem
intuitive
to
me
that
it
would
be.
still,
whatever
sicily...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
the
bank
is
of
sicily
compared
with
the
southern
boot
of
italy,
but
you
see
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
would
i
look--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right,
but
then
the
issue,
it's
ordinary
high
water
is
the
correct
term--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
something
like
a
special
median
extra-high
water,
and
not
top
bank,
so
we
should
disregard
those
terms
in
your
view,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
mean,
really,
the
height
of
the
bank.
