mr.
robert
r.
bailess
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
sit
here
and
listen
to
this
this
morning,
i
wished
i
had
been
standing
up
here
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
you
had
asked.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
justice
o'connor,
i
would...
you
mentioned
the
overlay
exhibits
which,
it
takes
a
little
time
to
examine
those
exhibits.
you
have
to
get
acquainted
with
them.
you
have
to
become
familiar
with
them.
if
each
of
you
took
the
time
to
get
familiar
with
the
overlays,
you
would
unquestionably
say
that
stack
island
has
existed
from...
and
the
first
good
metes
and
bounds,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
survey
that
is
performed
by
geodetic
positions...
that
is,
latitude
and
longitude
lines,
which
was
done
in
1882...
show
unquestionably
that
stack
island
at
that
time
was
good,
fastland
that
existed,
and
if
you
follow
that
on
through
up
to
1994,
you
will
see
that
that
island
is
in
substantially
the
same
position
through
all
of
those
years.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
justice
souter,
the
only
way
that
i
know
to
answer
that
question
is
to
say,
if
you
will
look
at
who
was
testifying
to
come
up
with
those
percentages,
it
was
dr.
winkley
on
cross-examination,
so
louisiana's
own
expert
witness
testified
to
that.
i
don't
know
how
better--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--your
honor,
mr.
keyser
attempted
to
talk
about
two
islands
when
we
tried
this
case
the
first
time
in
vicksburg
before
judge
barbour
in
1989.
he
again
tried
to
talk
about
this
other
island
in
the
supplemental
proceedings
before
judge
mckusick,
and
there
was
an
original
stack
island,
and
i
will
admit
to
you
today
that
the
original
surveyed,
patented
stack
island
is
not
located
in
the
exact
position
that
it's
located
in
today.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
no,
sir,
it's
not
nearly
6
miles
away.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
i
think
it's
substantially
correct,
your
honor.
he
was
not
my
witness.
i
had
him
on
cross-examination.
he
made
the
percentage,
i
accepted
it,
it
was
very--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--i
did.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
give
or
take
10
percent,
i
believe
you
will,
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
let
me
correct
one
other
thing
that
is
misleading.
when
judge
mckusick
and
the
attorneys
went
to
view
the
island
in
may
of
1994,
we
took
a
boat
and
we
went
around
the
island.
we
put
in
at
the
lake
providence
port
commission.
we
went
up
the
old
channel,
the
boundary
channel.
we
never
did
go
into
the
wooded
area
far
enough
to
see
dry
land,
but
i
can
assure
you
it's
there,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
if
you
read
the
hydrographic
surveys
that
are
in
evidence,
and
you
look
at
the
contours
on
those
hydrographic
surveys
which
are
surveying
the
top
bank
of
stack
island,
you
will
see
that
at
all
times
on
those
survey
maps,
stack
island
is
higher
than
what
mr.
winkley
is
trying
to
put
into
evidence
as
the...
he
called
it
the
top
bank,
and
in
each
instance
you
will
see
that
stack
island
exceeds
mr.
winkley's
top
bank
definition
by
at
least
5
feet
or
so.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
yes,
ma'am,
i
was.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
justice
o'connor,
we
did
not...
as
i
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago,
we
did
not
see
dry
land
on
that
trip,
mainly
because
to
get
in
there...
there
was
current
in
the
river,
and
we
would
have
had
to
go
in
between
trees
to
get
to
that
area,
and
we
felt
like
that
was
not
an
appropriate
thing
to
do
under
the
circumstances.
the
river--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--we
did
not
see
it.
we
went
back
in
september
when
we
heard
the
case.
when
judge
mckusick
heard
the
evidence,
we
went
back
on
an
afternoon
after
the
testimony
and
drove
onto
this
island
with
a
four-wheel-drive
vehicle.
we
drove
to
the
north
end
of
the
island
where
the
highest
elevation
is.
we
drove
to
the
south
end
of
the
island,
where
it's
much
lower.
but
at
that
time
there
was
conversations
in
the
vehicle
as
we
rode
around,
now,
judge
mckusick,
this
area
here
was
dry
when
we
were
here
4
months
ago.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
no.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
the...
if
you
look...
now,
at
times,
that
may
have
happened.
if
you
look
at
the
most
recent
hydrographic
survey,
if
i'm
not
mistaken...
it's
in
the
brief
on
page
25
in
footnote
23,
but
if
you'll
look
at
the
contour
on,
i
think
it's
of
the
most
recent
map,
the
stack
island
has
an
elevation
of
50
foot.
that
is,
50
foot
above
zero
gauge.
zero
gauge
is
defined
as
the
lowe
water
mark.
the
area
on
stack
island
on
the
north
end
is
50
foot
above
zero
gauge.
the
river--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--your
honor,
we
take
the
position
that
an
island
is
an
area
of
land
surrounded
by
water
that
has
permanent
features,
i.e.
vegetation,
i.e.
70-year-old
trees,
that
is
capable
of
sustaining
vegetation,
and
in
1881,
when
this
island
was
surveyed
by
the
general
land
office
of
the
united
states
by
a
deputy
surveyor,
it
had
trees
that
were
60
to
70
years
old
at
that
time.
mr.
jarvis
testified
that
in
1994
there
were
trees
on
this
island
that
were
40
to
42
inches
in
diameter,
which
would
have
made
those
trees
at
least
60
to
70
year
old
in
1994.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
according
to
mr.
winkley,
justice
stevens,
it's
35
feet.
according
to
mr.
winkley.
i
don't
adopt
mr.
winkley's
testimony.
i
don't
accept
his
definition
of
an
island,
but
at
lake
providence,
it's
approximately
35
feet,
according
to
mr.
winkley.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
the
corps
of
engineers
establishes
a
standard
low
water,
which
is
then
termed
zero
gauge.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
the
top
bank
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
35
feet.
when
we
visited
there
in
may
of
1994,
the
river
stage
was
46
feet
on
the
vicksburg
gauge,
which
at
vicksburg
is
3
feet
above
flood
stage,
so
it
was
above
top
bank
by
at
least
3
feet.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
your
honor,
above
zero
gauge,
stack
island
was
a
tremendous
island
in
size.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
at--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--our
position
is
standard
low
water,
your
honor.
now,
let
me
mention
this.
mr.
winkley
testified
that--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--pardon
me?
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
mr.
winkley
testified,
when
they
came
up
with
this
proposition
that
to
be
a
true
island
it
had
to
be
above
mean
high
water,
that's
the
term
that.
louisiana
came
up
with.
when
we
asked
mr.
winkley,
well,
what
is
mean
high
water,
he
said
he
didn't
know.
he
did
not
have
any
definition,
nor
did
the
corps
of
engineers,
nor
did
any
other
publication
that
he
knew
of
publish
a
definition
for
mean
high
water
on
the
mississippi
river.
so
we
asked,
well,
what
is
ordinary
high
water?
the
same
reply.
so
what
dr.
winkley
did
is,
he
then
came
up
with
a
definition
that
an
island
has
to
be
above
top
bank.
he
attributed
that
definition
to
himself.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
according
to
dr.
winkley,
it
is
approximately
35
feet
above
zero
gauge
which,
to
determine
that,
what
he
did
in
his
testimony
was,
he
took
a
period
of
time,
and
he
plotted
heights
of
the
river
during
the
1870's
to
the
1880's.
he
said
the
reason
he
did
that
is
because
it
was
before
levees.
therefore,
when
the
river
got
out
of
its
banks,
it
had
no
barrier
to
hold
it
up.
but
since
you
have
levees,
of
course,
the
top
bank,
according
to
him,
is
really...
you
can't
define
it,
because
levees
hold
the
water
in.
it
confines
the
water.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
there
are--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--i
can't
tell
you
from
memory,
but
i
believe
i
am
correct
in
saying
this,
that
the
50-foot
contour
on
stack
island
that
exists
according
to
the
1993
hydrographic
survey
that
is
in
evidence
is
at
least
as
high
as
the
top
of
the
levee.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
top
bank
is
what
they
say.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
that
is
correct,
and
dr.
winkley
admitted
that.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
let
me
answer
that
in
this
way.
in
louisiana,
the
louisiana
riparian
owns
from
the
bank
to
the
low
water
mark.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
it
ought
to
be.
in
mississippi,
the
riparian
owner
owns
to
the
thalweg,
all
the
way
out
to
the
state
boundary.
now,
why
would
you
penalize
the
mississippi
parties
and
the
state
of
mississippi
by
some
cockamamie
definition
of
top
bank,
that
an
island
has
to
be
at
top
bank
to
be
an
island?
it's
illogical.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
it
was
surveyed
in
'81--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--issued
in
'88.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
to
my
knowledge,
it
has
never
been
contested,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
your
honor,
if
it
truly
disappeared
by
the
natural
processes
of
the
river...
that
is,
the
channel
of
the
river
scoured
that
island
away,
then
the
island
in
my
opinion
would
be
no
more.
that
would
not
destroy
title
to
the
land
under
the
water,
though,
and
in
mississippi
the
riparian
owner
would
own
to
the
thalweg,
which
would
be
to
the
state
boundary,
so
it
wouldn't
disturb
title,
necessarily.
now,
if
that
island
came
back
in
the
same
place,
then
conceivably
title
would
never
be
disturbed,
but
there
is
absolutely
no
proof
in
this
record
that
stack
island
washed
away.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
justice
breyer--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--mr.
mccartney
asked
that
question
to
mr.
winkley.
what
if
the
mississippi
bank
is
1,000...
i
mean,
100-foot
cliff,
and
the
louisiana
bank
is...
is
at
your
top
bank.
mr.
winkley
couldn't
really
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
point
the
court
to
two
cases.
one
is
the
case
of
scott
v.
lattig,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
which
gives
a
factual
basis
in
that
case
for
an
island.
it
doesn't
say
that
this
court
made
the
determination
for
all
legal
principles
that
you
have
to
have
this
to
be
an
island,
but
in
that
case,
it
had,
really,
four
things.
one
was,
they
said...
this
is
factual
things.
this
island,
in
scott
v.
lattig,
was
3
to
5
feet
above
ordinary
high
water.
2)
it
was
covered
for
the
most
part
with
wild
grass,
sagebrush,
and
young
timber,
and
3)
it
was...
had
substantial
evidence
of
permanence,
and
4)
that
it
had
been
there
when
idaho
became
a
state.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
i
have
used
the
term
myself,
high
bank,
a
number
of
times
throughout
this
litigation
to
describe
the
bank
coming
from
louisiana
or
mississippi
where
the
bank
makes
a
severe
slope
coming
off
of
the
flatland
down
into
the
bed
of
the
river.
i've
used
that
term
high
bank.
i
may
have
even
used
the
word
top
bank,
but
not
for
the
purposes
of
defining
an
island.
the
only
other
case--
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
--thank
you,
justice
kennedy,
i
was
going
to
do
that.
the
other
case
is
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
case.
it's
uhlorn
v.
u.s.
gypsum
company,
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
the
elevation
of
the
land
was
not
the
deciding
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
state
boundary
would
be
lost,
or
to
say
it
a
different
way,
it
did
not
have
to
reach
an
ordinary
high
water
mark
in
order
for
the
state
boundary
to
remain...
in
that
case
i
don't
remember
if
it
was
to
the
west
or
the
east
or
the
north
or
the
south,
but
for
the
state
boundary
to
remain
where
it
was
when
the
change
in
channel
occurred.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
louisiana
had
the
burden
of
proof.
they
filed
this
original
action.
we
still
take
that
position.
i'm
a
little
different
in
representing
the
state
of
mississippi
than
mr.
mccartney
is.
he
filed
no
counterclaim.
mississippi
filed
a
counterclaim
to
louisiana's
original
complaint
claiming
that
it
was
under
mississippi
sovereignty,
and
we
proved
that,
so
as
between
louisiana
and
mississippi
we
had
maybe
an
equal
burden
of
proof
only
because
i
filed
the
counterclaim.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
case
of
kansas
v.
missouri.
i
don't
remember
the
date
of
that.
i
think
it
was
a
1913
case,
but
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
the
party
who
filed
the
original
complaint
had
the
burden
of
proof
in
an
original
action.
if
i
could
review
my
notes
just
a
moment.
kansas
v.
missouri
is
322
u.s.
213,
1944
case.
mr.
robert
r.
bailess
thank
you,
your
honor.
