before
we
leave
the
thalweg
issue,
whether
it
was
west
of
the
disputed
territory
or
not,
i
confess
to
be
totally
at
a
loss
to
understand
what's
going
on
here.
in
the
brief
of
mississippi,
it
is
stated
in
this
case
it
is
undisputed
that
the
boundary
thalweg
was
west
of
stack
island
in
its
prepatent
location.
is
that
a
misstatement?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
prepatent
location.
it
was
west
of
stack
island,
you
don't
contest
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
testimony
contradicts
the
series
of
maps,
does
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
with
the
affidavit
by
those
who
claimed
to
have
farmed
the
land,
there
is
conflicting
testimony,
and
isn't
the
master
entitled
to
rely
on
the
series
of
maps,
rather
than
on
the
testimony
of
your
one
expert
witness?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
this
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
said
it
was
totally
scoured?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
you
row
among--
[laughter]
didn't
you
row
among
the
treetops
with
mr.
keyser?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
said
that
it
has
to
be
permanently
above
high
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
permanently
above
flood
tide,
or
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
permanently
above
normal
high
water,
and
so
i
took
your
statement
to
mean
that
if
at
the
time
when
you
went
motoring
among
the
treetops
the
whole
island
was
underwater,
that
would
contradict
your
case,
but
you
say
the
whole
island...
because
i
assume
that
was
just
normal
mississippi
high
water
at
that
time.
that
wasn't
a
flood,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
picked
a
bad
time
to
go,
then.
you
should
have
been
out
during--
[laughter]
during
normal--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
keyser
says
four
witnesses
testified
to
that,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccartney,
do
we
know
who
did
the
lunch
map?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
the
author
unknown?
it
just
sort
of
appears?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
get
maps
into
evidence
like
that?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--without
knowing--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
think
it
really
is?
what's
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
top
bank
means
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
once
you
establish
an
island
on
the
basis
of,
you
know,
a
portion
of
it
is
above...
at
least
some
portion
is
above
top
bank,
whatever
that
means,
the
next
question
is,
how
much
of
that
chunk
of
mud
and
whatever
is
an
island?
is
the
island
then
that
you
have
identified,
does
it
extend
down
to
the
low
water
mark?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
low
water
mark.
so
it
ought
to
be
the
same
for
the
island
owner.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
may
i
ask
one
more
question?
suppose
the
island
does...
does
disappear
and
reemerge,
does
that
mean
all
bets
are
off?
i
mean,
what's...
is
it
the
same
island,
or
do
you
have
to
start
all
over
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
never
heard
of
the
term
high
bank
before,
did
you?
