justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
the
disputed
area,
roughly,
in
a
10-year
period,
or
from
1930
if
the
record
tells
us,
what
period
of
time
was
it
underwater?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
how
long?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
long
does
the
high
water
last?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
some
periods
it
would
be
underwater
for
3
or
4
months?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
with
reference
to
the
definition
of
an
island,
can
you
give
us
some
idea
of
how
to
measure
the
time
that
the
island
has
to
be
above
water,
or
above
the
high
water
mark,
in
order
to
qualify
as
an
island
under
your
definition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
it's
above
high
water
for
just
once
a
year?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
day
a
year?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
we're
asking.
how
long--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--how
long
does
it
have
to
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
1
day
a
year
suffices.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
the
definition
that
the
master
used
was
whether
or
not
it
was
below
or
above
for
a
protracted
period
of
time.
