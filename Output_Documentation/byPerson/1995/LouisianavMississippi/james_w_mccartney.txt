mr.
james
w.
mccartney
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
has
emerged
from
mr.
keyser's
argument
is
in
our
view
simply
that
we
have,
as
we
had
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
an
identity
issue.
that
is
to
say,
is
the
disputed
area
stack
island
as
it
was
patented
but
changed
in
configuration
and
location
over
a
very
lengthy
period
of
time?
the
court
appointed
the
special
master.
the
special
master
reviewed
all
of
the
evidence.
the
special
master
heard
the
witnesses.
the
special
master
also
heard
some
of
the
arguments
that
you
have
heard
today.
the
special
master
addressed
the
question
of
whether
this
was
an
island.
the
special
master
found
from
the
record,
and
we
have
undertaken
in
our
brief
at
page
25,
joint
response,
footnote
23,
to
identify
the
evidence
in
the
record
that
demonstrates
not
only
that
this
island
has
the
appropriate
permanence
which
is
the
test
that
we
submit
is
the
appropriate
test,
that
it
has
the
appropriate...
has
the
permanence
to
qualify
as
an
island,
but
also
that
it
was
above
high
water,
and
the
thought--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--your
honor,
when
i
say
that,
i'm
talking
about
constantly.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
now,
there
may
be--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
well--
[laughter]
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
we
rowed
among
treetops,
but
there
was
also
water...
dry
land
above
the
water.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
well,
what
happened
was
that
a
part
of
the
time...
we
motored,
we
didn't
actually
row.
[laughter]
we
motored
among
the
trees
over
that
portion
of
the
island
that
was
inundated
at
that
particular
time
of
the
year,
and
the
master
was
there,
and
viewed
the
island,
and
heard
the
evidence,
and
read
the
cases,
and
reached
the
conclusion,
correctly,
that
this
is
a
land
mass
that
has
the
degree
of
permanence
that
qualifies
as
an
island,
and
that
qualifies
as
a
feature
that
determines
boundary.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
well,
i
didn't...
if
i
said
that,
you
honor...
i
thought
you
were
asking
me...
i
didn't
say
it
had
to
be
permanently
above
water.
i
didn't
intend
to,
let
me
say
that.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
overwhelming...
well,
let's
direct
our
attention
first
to
the
question
that
you
asked.
no,
we
don't
say
that
it
has
to
be
permanently
above
water.
i
think
that
an
island
could
flood
and
still
have
permanence
over
100
years,
and
the
master
so
found,
and
documented
his
findings
quite
overwhelmingly
in
this
appendix.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
it
was
a
flood,
but
your
honor,
i
guess
that--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--we
wanted
to
see
it
at
its
worst.
we
were
perfectly
prepared
for
the
master
to
examine
the
feature
at
the
time
of
extreme
high
water.
actually,
that's...
it
just
happened
to
be
that
way.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
we
picked
any
particular
time.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
that--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--your
honor--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--your
honor,
that
is
my
recollection
at
this
time,
and
mr.
bailess
will
address
that,
but
that
is
my
recollection,
and--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--no.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
i
mean,
as
pointed
out,
we
have
trees
that...
evidence
that
there
were
trees
there
that
had
been
50,
60
years
old,
and
if
i
may
just
add
to
the
evidence,
in
your
review
of
the
evidence
of
permanence,
in
addition
to
what
the
special
master
laid
out
in
his
appendix
d,
which
is
itself
overwhelmingly
compelling,
particularly
when
compared
to
the
single
or...
map
that
they
relied
on
to
say
that
the
island
was
scoured
clean,
and
the
bed
of
the
river
was
scoured
clean
of
this
feature
in
1883.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
that
is
not
so.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
the
lunch
map--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--which
itself,
and
i'll
just...
it's
credibility
is
destroyed,
or
at
least
seriously
impaired,
because
one
of
their
experts
gives
it
to
the
other
expert
in
the
middle
of
trial,
and
he
takes
that
map,
and
he
says,
oh,
you
know,
this
land
was
underwater,
and
we
say,
well,
wait
a
minute,
here
are
affidavits
given
in
1885
that
say
these
people
were
farming--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--and...
and
he
says,
how
can
they
be
farming
land
that's
underwater,
and
we
say,
that
is
a
good
question.
obviously,
they
can't.
the
map
was
wrong.
it's
a
spurious
map.
besides,
in
addition
to
these
documentary
demonstrations
of
permanence,
we
have
to
remember
that
in
1921,
after
they
say
this
was
scoured
clean,
there
was
a
timber
deed
given
to
my
clients,
the
houstons,
the
private
parties.
in
1931,
there
was
another
timber
deed,
so
these
people
are
selling...
these
are
the
blackwells,
the
patentees
are
selling
timber
off
the
island
in
'21,
'31,
an
then
my
clients
lend
money
and
take
a
mortgage
on
this
piece
of
land
that's
54
feet,
according
to
this
mr.
winkley,
underwater.
they
lend
them
money,
and
then
they
foreclose
on
the
mortgage.
[laughter]
the
state
of
mississippi,
they
take
a
tax
deed.
they
foreclose
for
the
nonpayment
of
taxes.
there's
litigation
over
this
island.
this
island
has
been
known
to
all
of
the
parties.
there's
overwhelming
documentary
evidence
that
it's
continued
in
existence.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
we
do
not.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
author
unknown--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--well--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--your
honor,
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you,
we
wanted
that
map
in
evidence,
because
the
reliance
on
that
map
and
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
found...
and
it
was
a
total
reliance...
utterly
destroyed
the
credibility
of
mr.
winkley,
and
so
we
were
perfectly
happy
for
him
to
rely
on
this
map
that
mysteriously
appears
at
lunch
and
say,
yes,
this
is
what
i'm
relying
on,
and
therefore
this
island
was
scoured
away
and
washed
away
and
ceased
to
exist,
and
so--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--your
honor,
i've
taken
a
position
on
that
in
a
previous
argument
that
you
are
free
to
take
your
own
factfindings,
and
that
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
does
not
apply.
i
think
that
to
be
correct,
but
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
under
these
circumstances
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming
that
that
question
does
not
come
into
play.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
thank
you.
