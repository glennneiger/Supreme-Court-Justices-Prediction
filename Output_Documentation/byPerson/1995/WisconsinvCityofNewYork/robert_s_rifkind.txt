mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
let
me
say
at
the
beginning
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that
secretary
mosbacher's
decision
was
unconstitutional.
it
only
held,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
district
court
had
employed
an
inappropriate
standard
when
it
found
that
the
secretary's
decision,
though
mistaken,
must
be
sustained
because
not
so
far
beyond
the
pale
of
reason
as
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
there
should
be
no
question
about
it.
the
district
court
found
that
the
secretary's
decision
was
wrong,
but
not
beyond
the
pale
of
reason.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
basis
was,
first
of
all,
13
days
of
trial
and
the
consideration
of
the
evidence
submitted
there,
but
i
think
very
largely
on
the
basis
made
of
concessions
made
by
the
secretary.
the
secretary
never
found...
never
found...
that
the
adjustment
was
less
accurate
than
the
original
count.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
what
the
district
court
said...
and
this
is
in
the
wisconsin
appendix
at
page
77...
the
secretary
has
conceded
that
the
objective
criteria
used
to
measure
the
adjusted
counts
show
a
greater
numeric
accuracy
at
the
national
level
and
that
the
census
bureau
estimates
of
distributive
accuracy
marginally
favored
the
adjusted
counts.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
found...
it
adds
up
to
being
wrong
if
the
standard
is,
is
the
corrected
count
more
accurate
than
the
original
count,
and--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--i
believe,
as
i
believe
the
second
circuit
did,
that
where
fundamental
constitutional
rights
are
impacted,
the
court
must
conduct
a
more
searching
inquiry
than
merely
beyond
the
pale
of
reason.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
absolutely.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
the...
i
think
the
key
factors
here
are
that
the
census
bureau,
the
expert
agency,
to
which
normally
i
would
suppose
considerable
deference
was
due,
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
trying
to
figure
out
the
solution
to
the
problem,
after
an
enormous
amount
of
effort
and
a
very
professional
effort
had
decided
that
it
had
figured
out
the
solution,
or
at
least
a
significant
amelioration
of
the
problem,
and
i
must
say,
justice
breyer,
repeatedly
advised
the
department
of
commerce
that
there
was
no
other
way.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
what
i'm...
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
a
decision
that
overthrows,
as
the
secretary
did
twice...
overthrows
the
recommendation
of
the
expert
agency,
when
the
secretary
himself
obviously
claims--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--expressly
claims
no
expertise,
it
raises
a
question
about
who--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--i
do
not
believe
that
arbitrary
and
capricious
is
the
appropriate
standard.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
what
i...
i
guess
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
where
you
have...
where
the
court
has
decided...
and
i
thought
this
court
had
decided...
that
it
would
look
searchingly
at
government
action
that
undermines
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
that
under
those
circumstances,
when
one
considers
the
whole
matrix
of
factors,
the
fact
that
an
expert
agency
had
made
a
recommendation
and
that
the
secretary
of
commerce
had
overturned
it
would
lead
a
court
to
at
least
inquire
did
he
have
very
good
reasons
to
overturn
it.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
promulgation
by
the
secretary
of
counts,
in
which
persons
are
in
very
large
numbers
omitted
not
uniformly
across
the
country
but,
as
we
have
known
since
1940,
in
those
places
in
which
minorities
reside...
those
minorities
and
the
people
who
live
next
door
to
them,
as
the
general
said,
are
undercounted
when
it
comes
to
drawing
districts.
that
was
established
by
professor
kohl
at
princeton
in
1955
and
is
conceded.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
are
entitled
to
a
different
form
of
count
if
there
is
an
available
count
that
doesn't
have
that
consequence.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the...
there
is
a
tradition
that
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
century
of
bureau
autonomy.
the
remarkable
thing
about
the
1990
census
is
it
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
secretary
of
commerce
has
undelegated
to
the
director
of
the
bureau
the
authority
that
the
director
of
the
bureau
has
always
had
in
this
respect.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
believe
that
the
secretary
did
not
pursue
in
good
faith
the
zealous
pursuit
of
equality
and
accuracy
which
should
be
the
overriding
command.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think...
let
me
be
clear.
no
one
has
suggested,
not
the
census
bureau
and
not
we...
no
one
has
suggested
a
substitute...
that
is,
disregarding
the
enumeration
entirely.
the
only
question
is
whether
it
can
be
improved
by
statistical
means.
i
don't
hear
the
government,
the
solicitor
general,
or
anyone
else
suggest
that,
except
for
wisconsin
perhaps,
that
one
could
never
use
a
correction
of
statistical
nature
to
improve
the
quality.
and,
of
course--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--i
think
wisconsin
in
that
respect
is
wrong.
i
think--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
me
on
that,
and
i
will
say
why.
i
think
that
when
the
constitution
uses
the
word
"enumeration",
it
means
to
render
in
numbers.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
take
the
word--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--i
take
it
the
word
"actual
enumeration"
in
context
there
differentiates
it
from
the
attribution--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--contained
in
the...
well,
in
the
proceedings
clause
of
the
constitution
which
says
for
the
first
3
years
we'll
allocate
congress
the
following
way.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--it
was.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
not
sure
that
one
gets
it
because
it
disproportionately
affects
minorities.
i
would
have
thought
one
got
it
under
the
line
of
cases
following
baker
v.
carr.
one
gets
it
because
when
we
require
of
states
that
they
proportion
quite
precisely
equal
numbers
for
equal...
equal
representation
for
equal
numbers,
we
don't
inquire
about
their
intent,
and
we
don't
listen
to
200
years
of
history
as
an
explanation
for
why
they
got
there
because--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--i
don't
think
that's
all
that's
before
us,
although
that
is
before
us.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
we
all
know...
and
the
congress
has
commanded...
that
the
census
also
be
available
for
the
states
to
use
in
drawing
congressional
districts.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
it
would
be
a
temeritous
state
that
declined
to
use
the
census
counts
to
draw
its
congressional
districts.
after
karcher
at
least,
i
think
there's
a
grave
doubt
whether
they're
free
to
do
that,
but
assuming
they
are,
they
will
certainly
be
exposed
to
an
array
of
litigation
much
larger
than
has
been
suggested.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
this
is
fairly
traceable
to
what
the
secretary
does.
as
a
practical
matter,
we
know
the
secretary
is
commanded
by
section
141
to
give
to
each
of
the
states
the
most
accurate
data
they
can
so
that
they
can
draw
their
congressional
districts,
state
districts,
state
legislative
districts.
and
since
1962,
this
court
has
required
the
states
to
do
just
that,
to
draw
equal
populace
districts.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
state
in
fact
is
equipped
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
only...
in
this
case
we
have
the
numbers
because
we
forced
the
government
to
give
them
the
numbers.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
even
so,
most
states
have
constitutional
requirements
of
their
own
and
statutes
of
their
own
that
say
you
use
what
the
secretary
of
commerce
delegates...
sends
to
you
pursuant
to
section
141
of
the
code.
and--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--well,
that
may
be.
as
a...
in
this
decade
that
doesn't
solve
the
problem.
we
have
a
set
of
data
and
we
have
an
alternate
set
of
data.
the
secretary
chose
the
data
that
the
experts
in
the
agency,
that
the
bureau
told
them
were
the
less
reliable,
that
missed
4
million
or
5
million
people
nationally,
that
undercounted
blacks,
hispanics,
asians,
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
there's
at
least
a
suggestion
in
karcher
that
the
states
are
required
to
use
the
census
counts
unless
they
can
prove...
prove...
that
they
have
something
better,
at
the
very
least.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
justice
souter--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--with
respect,
it
is
fundamentally
wrong.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
and
i'd
like
to
address
that.
the
census
is
full
of
estimation.
the
original
enumeration,
the
enumeration,
is
full
of
estimation.
every
director
of
the
bureau
that
i
have
known
of...
and
we
quote
several
of
them
at
page
9
of
our
brief...
has
said
the
notion
that
there's
no
estimation
in
the
enumeration
doesn't
understand
what
the
actual
way
we
count
people
is.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
is--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--there
is
more
estimation
involved,
although
in
1980--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--the
explanation
involved
which
involved
imputing
the
existence
of
people
and
their
numbers
by
a
very
crude
device
was
challenged
in
orr
v.
baldrige
in
a
dispute
between
florida
and
oklahoma
because
it
shifted
a
congressman,
and
the
census
bureau
prevailed.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
my
recollection
is
that
in...
that
the
process
there
involved
is
when
a
house
was
seen
to
be...
you
couldn't
find
the
people
in
the
house
and
the
neighbors
didn't
know
how
many
people
were
there
and
the
postman
didn't
know
how
many
people
were
there,
they
said,
we
know
it's
not
vacant,
so
we'll
attribute
the
numbers
in
this
house
to
be
equal
to
the
numbers
of
people
in
the
adjacent
house.
and
with
that
device,
which
i
describe
as
crude,
but
better
than
nothing,
they
added,
as
i
recall,
790,000
people
to
the
census
which
shifted
a
congressman
from
indiana
to
florida.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
and
in
previous
decades,
they've
added
millions
of
people
by
similar
estimating
processes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
can
see
it.
dr.
bryant
said,
reasonable
men
can
differ,
reasonable
persons
can
differ.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
there's
a
risk
of
that.
i
did--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--i
must
say
i
don't
envy
the
position
dr.
bryant
was
in
when
she
had
to
utter
that
statement.
she
was
standing
next
to
her
boss,
and
it's
a
common
thing
for
non
lawyers
to
say
when
they're
standing
next
to
their
bosses.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
if
you
read
the
report...
and
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
of
dr.
bryant...
you
read
the
report
of
the
census
committee,
you
read
those
sorts
of
materials,
you
come
away
with
the
feel
that
she
felt
very
emphatically
that
they
had
solved
the
problem.
and
with
good
reason
because--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--no
one
at
the
trial
and
not
the
secretary
said
that
the
enumeration
was
better,
whatever
that
means,
than
the
correction.
what
the
secretary
said
in
effect
was
because
sampling
is
involved,
because
sampling
always
brings
in
an
element
of
what
the
statisticians
call
sampling
error,
random
error,
there's
an
element
i
don't
know
quite
as
much
about,
and
because
i
don't
know,
i'm
going
to
prefer
what
is
on
its
face
the
worst
mechanism.
that's
essentially
the
ground
rules
for
decision
that
the
secretary
put
out.
and
i
think
whether
that's
an
appropriate
ground
rule
for
decision
where
constitutional
rights
are
involved
is
an
appropriate
inquiry
for
a
court.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no.
i
think
he
goes
further
actually,
justice
ginsburg.
he
says
the
court
is
satisfied
that
for
most
purposes...
that
is
appendix
59...
for
most
purposes
the
pes
resulted
in
a
more
accurate
count
than
the
original
census.
and
he
says,
the
secretary
has
conceded
that
the
objective
criteria
used
to
measure
the
adjusted
counts
show
a
greater
numeric
accuracy
at
the
national
level
and
that
the
census
bureau's
estimates
of
distributive
accuracy
marginally
favor
the
adjusted--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--that's
just--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--my
understanding
of
what
he
said
is
that
he
never
actually
says
that
the
adjustment
is
not
better,
or
to
put
it
differently,
that
the
enumeration
is
better
for
that
purpose
too,
justice
scalia,
than
the
adjusted
counts.
what
he
says
is,
since
i
can't
tell--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--then
my
rule
of
decision
tells
me
i
rule
that
way.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
it's
unreasonable
for
at
least
three
or
four
reasons.
first...
and
i
think
this
is
something
that
courts
are
quite
as
capable
of
addressing
as
the
secretary
of
commerce.
everyone
knew
going
into
this
that
what
was
going
to
go
on
was
the
substitution
to
some
extent
of
random
error,
the
error
derived
from
sampling,
as
against
what
the
statisticians
call
but
we
also
call
bias.
and
the
secretary
has
decided
here,
among
other
things,
that
he
prefers
bias
to
random
error.
and
i
think
the
courts
are
entitled
to
say
that's
something
one
ought
to
look
at
very
closely
because
the
bias
that
the
secretary
preferred
over
random
error
is
consistently,
persistently
decade
after
decade
falling
in
the
same
places.
it
doesn't
float
around
and
it
has
a
very
distinct
sense
of
unfairness.
there
are
a
lot
of
respects
in
which
we
use
random
methods.
when
we
pick
a
jury
or
when
we
pick
a
draft,
we
use
random
methods
because
there
is
a
heightened
sense
of
equity
in
it,
and
i
think
that's
a
relative
consideration.
but
secondly,
the
secretary
had
agreed
with
us
in
the
stipulation
which
this
case
produced
on
a
mechanism
that
was
going
to
be
employed
as
part
of
the
census.
at
the
time
he
did
that,
he
had
before
him
the
machinery
that
the
census
bureau
had
prepared.
the
decision
he
finally
came
to,
after...
and
everyone
agrees
that
the
post
enumeration
survey
was
excellently
conducted.
the
secretary
doesn't
dispute
that.
so,
the
decision
he
finally
came
to
was
a
decision
he
could
have
come
to
before
he
started
because
he
knew
that
a
measurable,
foreseeable
amount
of
random
error
was
going
to
be
interjected
into
the
affair.
i
think
that's
inconsistent
with,
if
you
like,
it's
not
in
good
faith
with,
the
stipulation
that
he
entered
into
at
the
beginning
saying
we're
going
to
conduct
this
post
enumeration
survey
and
we're
going
to
conduct
it
as
part
of
the
census
under
the
ground
rules,
under
the
tests,
under
the
standards
that
the
bureau
has
set
forth.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
met
all
those
tests.
suddenly
there
was
a
change
of
grounds
of
decision,
a
change
of
the
rules
of
decision,
if
you
like,
and
i
think
that
is
suspect
and
requires
further
attention
from
a
court,
or
at
least
i
think
that's
what
the
second
circuit
was
saying.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
absolutely.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
maybe
that's
because
it's
not
clear
to
me,
but
i
think
the
answer
is
both,
your
honor.
i
think
we
rely
on
what
underpins
the
line
of
decisions,
wesberry
and
everything
since
baker
v.
carr,
and
i
think
those
come
both
from
the...
according
to
their
respective
numbers--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--it
certainly
includes
that.
there
was...
i
should
be
clear
because
the
solicitor
general
questioned
this
in
his
brief.
there's
extensive
testimony
in
the
record
uncontested
that
congressional
district
by
congressional
district...
and
we
used
the
example
of
california...
the
number
of
people
uncounted
varied
directly
with
the
number
of
minority
in
the
congressional
district
and,
to
be
frank,
varied
directly
with
the
number
of
democrats
registered
in
the
district.
so,
there
is
a
close...
and
the
regression
analyses
that
were
done
on
it
were
very
meticulous...
a
very
close
and
overwhelming--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
who
live
in
new
york
say
that
whether
or
not
new
york
is
entitled
to
an
additional
congressman,
new
york
city
is
entitled
to
a
larger
share
of
the
electoral
power
of
the
state
of
new
york
both
in
congress
and
in
albany.
and
the
same
thing
is
said
by
my
colleagues
from
los
angeles
who
are
here,
although
california--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--i
think
in
my
view
in
principle
that
ought
to
be
right.
i
think
in
practice,
with
all
respect,
i
think
it's
wholly
unrealistic.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
it's
not
only
politically.
they're
not
equipped
to
do
it
as
a
general
matter,
and
congress
has
required--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--but
they
are
numbers
that
until
this
day
had
been
under
the
great
cloud
that
the
secretary
of
commerce
put
them
under,
and
that's
why
i
say
it
would
be
a
courageous
state
attorney
general
in
california
or
new
york
who
said,
well,
we're
going
to...
the
secretary
of
commerce
rejected
that,
but
that's
what
we're
going
to
use
in
new
york.
i
think
that
takes
a
temerity--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--the
new
york
constitution
requires.
now,
you
say
the
new
york
constitution
could
be
amended,
and
i
agree
with
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
as
a
practical
matter...
and
i
can't
get
further
than
that...
it's
unrealistic.
i
think
to
put
it
differently,
the
claim
of
the
new
york
city
dweller
or
the
los
angeles...
or
of
los
angeles
or
of
the
los
angeles
dweller
is
fairly
traceable
to
the
action
taken
by
the
secretary
of
commerce.
