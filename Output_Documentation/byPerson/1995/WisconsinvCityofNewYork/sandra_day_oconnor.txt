what--
--would
you
go--
--what
do
you
say
is
the
applicable
standard
that
we
should
employ
in
determining
whether
the
secretary's
decision
is
consistent
with
the
constitutional
goal
of
equal
representation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
claim
that
the
secretary
did
not
act
in
good
faith
in
putting
out
the
actual
count
census
and
relying
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
clear
that
some
kind
of
statistical
substitute
for
an
actual
count
is
permissible
under
the
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
is
here
saying
the
constitution
doesn't
permit
any
statistical
adjustment.
why
do
we
think
it
does?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rifkind,
are
you...
you
are
relying
at
bottom
on
a
constitutional
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
census
clauses
of
the
constitution
or
the
fifth
amendment
as
well?
it's
not
clear
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
specific
harm
claimed?
the
change
in
congressional
reapportionment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some
claim
of
harm
because
of
the
intrastate
districting
that
results
ultimately?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
claim
that
as
well.
