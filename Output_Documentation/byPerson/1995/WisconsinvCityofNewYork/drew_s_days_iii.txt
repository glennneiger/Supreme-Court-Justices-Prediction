mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
true
total
population
of
the
united
states
is
unknown
and
perhaps
unknowable.
at
every
10
years
for
the
last
200,
the
united
states
government
has
been
making
the
best
effort
possible
to
count
every
person
it
could
in
compliance
with
article
i,
section
2,
clause
3
of
the
constitution.
the
1990
census
was
no
exception.
by
all
accounts,
it
was
the
most
well
organized
and
most
thorough
census
in
history,
accounting
for
98.4
percent
of
the
population.
since
at
least
1790,
people
informed
about
the
census
taking
process--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
it's
an
estimation,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
the
best
we
can.
i
think
everybody
has
recognized
that
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
100
percent
accurate
census,
and
that's
very
much
bound
up
in
this
case.
since
at
least
1790,
people
familiar
with
the
census
taking
process
have
realized
that
the
process
does
not
locate
everyone
in
the
country.
in
fact,
in
1790
george
washington
and
thomas
jefferson
were
convinced
that
the
population
of
the
new
nation
would
be
4
million,
and
they
were
not
persuaded
otherwise
when
the
census
came
in
at
3,890,000.
but
since
at
least
1940,
the
census
bureau
has
recognized
that
there's
something
called
a
differential
undercount,
that
is,
that
certain
minority
groups,
certain
racial
groups
are
undercounted,
not
captured
by
the
census
to
the
same
degree
as
non
minority
groups.
in
this
case
the
responses...
the
respondents
contend
that
a
statistically
adjusted
alternative
to
the
actual
count
should
have
been
adopted
by
the
secretary
of
the
commerce
because
of
its
alleged
superior
ability
to
correct
for
this
differential
undercount.
the
secretary,
however,
declined
to
do
that,
relying
upon
the
actual
count
because
he
believed
that
it
provided
a
more
reliable
basis
for
apportioning
representatives
among
the
states,
which
after
all
is
the
primary
purpose
of
the
census,
and
he
did
not
believe
it
promised
to
cure
the
differential
undercount
in
any
event.
the
district
court
upheld
the
secretary's
decision.
on
appeal,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
the
secretary,
by
failing
to
adopt
the
statistically
adjusted
alternative,
did
not
make...
and
i
quote...
a
good
faith
effort
to
achieve
the
objective
of
equal
representation
for
equal
population
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
where
the
secretary
was
going
to
be
required
to
show
that
his
decision
was
essential
to
the
achievement
of
a
legitimate
governmental
objective
in
order
to
avoid
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality.
we're
here
seeking
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
with
directions
of
entry
of
judgment
for
the
petitioners
because
we
submit
that
the
secretary's
decision,
following
a
200-year
tradition,
was
within
the
range
of
options
afforded
by
the
constitution
to
the
secretary
and
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
failed
to
show
the
proper
level
of
deference
to
the
secretary's
decision
that
he
is
entitled
to
in
carrying
out
his
responsibilities
with
respect
to
the
census.
one
of
the
first
things
that
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
do
was
recognize
the
broad
delegation
that
the
constitution
gives
to
congress
and
congress
in
turn
gives
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
in
carrying
out
the
census
process.
article
i,
section
2,
clause
3
says
that
the
congress
shall
conduct
the
census
in
such
a
manner
as
they
shall,
by
law,
direct.
and
congress
by
statute
says
that
the
secretary
may
conduct
the
census
in
such
form
and
content
as
he
may
determine.
these
are
very
broad
delegations
to
both
the
congress
and
to
the
secretary.
in
conformity
with
his
powers
under
statute
and
under
the
constitution,
the
secretary
of
commerce
made
three
decisions.
the
first
was
to
put
distributive
accuracy,
that
is,
the
ability
to
allocate
population
among
the
states
so
that
apportionment
of
representatives
among
the
states
can
be
carried
out
in
a
responsible
fashion.
he
was
going
to
use
that
as
the
principal
focus
of
his
analysis
in
comparing
the
actual
count
and
the
statistically
adjusted
count.
his
second
determination
was
that
the
statistical
adjustment
had
to
be
shown
to
be
superior
with
respect
to
distributive
accuracy
if
he
were
going
to
use
that
instead
of
the
actual
count.
and
the
third
was,
after
great
deliberation
and
analysis,
the
secretary
decided
that
the
adjusted
count
was
not
superior
to
the
actual
count
and,
therefore,
he
went
with
the
tradition
of
200
years
and
made
the
actual
count
the
official
census
of
the
united
states.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
approach
that
you
were
just
describing
was
in
fact
what
the
framers
engaged
in
when
they
came
up
with
article
i,
section
2,
clause
3.
it
was
an
estimate.
and
the
interpretation
of
actual
enumeration--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
true,
but
i
think
that
what
the
term
actual
enumeration
really
suggests
is
that
the
framers
wanted
to
leave
open
to
the
congress
and
later
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
the
ability
to
rely
upon
developments
with
respect
to
nose
counting
or
head
counting.
but
i
think
one
can
say
about
the
term
"actual
enumeration"
that
there
has
to
be
a
good
faith
effort
by
the
congress
and
by
now
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
count
bodies,
to
find
people.
and,
therefore,
a
totally
synthetic
census
i
think
would
be
contrary
to
the
constitutional
objective.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
there
is,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
any
definitive
decision
has
been
made,
but
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
plan
to
conduct
a
synthetic
census,
that
is,
not
going
out,
as
has
been
the
case
for
200
years.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
after
you
do
that.
well,
i
think
that
the
plan
is
to
use
some
sampling,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
plan
to
use
a
pes
approach
at
this
point.
i
don't
think
there
have
been
any
final
determinations.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
there
is
ongoing
experimentation
and
study
of
various
statistical
forms
of
adjustment.
in
fact,
secretary
mosbacher
encouraged
the
census
bureau,
after
he
decided
in
july
of
1991,
to
continue
to
experiment
and
do
research
on
the
whole
idea
of
statistically
adjusted
censuses.
but
as
i
was
saying,
i
don't
think
there's
any
determination
at
this
point
to
do
a
pes
in
the
way
that
was
suggested
in
this
lawsuit
and
is
the
subject
of
the
debate
between
the
respondents
and
us.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i'm
not
certain,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
think
that
after
he
heard
13
days
of
testimony
from
experts
of
the
highest
caliber--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--he
may
have
been
punchy,
but
i
think
he
also
got
the
sense
that
the
statistical
science
was
moving
forward
and
there
would
probably
be
the
ability
of
the
census
bureau
to
rely
more
heavily
than
in
the
past
on
this.
after
all,
we
have
seen
a
progression
in
1980
that
was
an
effort
by
the
census
bureau
to
look
at
what
was
called
a
post
enumeration
program,
not
a
pes
but
a
pep,
and
it
was
decided
that
that
was
not
sufficiently
robust
or
reliable
to
use.
in
1990
we've
moved
another
step,
and
i
think
he
was
simply
suggesting
that
science
and
time
move
on
without
any
definitive
understanding
of
exactly
what
might
happen.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that
may
well
be
but,
justice
scalia,
if
we
are
successful
to
the
extent
that
we
would
like
to
be
in
this
suit,
we
think
there
would
be
a
cutting
back
on
challenges
to
determinations
made
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
in
this
regard.
if
appropriate
deference
is
shown
to
the
secretary
in
making
these
decisions,
which
are
myriad,
in
coming
to
a
conclusion
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
respect
to
the
census,
what
types
of
adjustments
should
be
made,
then
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to
experience
what
was
the
case
after
the
1980
census
in
which
there
were
50
lawsuits
that...
over
50
lawsuits
that
weren't
concluded
until
1987.
our
principal
point
is
that
there
are
some
types
of
challenges
that
deserve
to
be
in
court
when
there's
an
indication
of
intentional
racial
discrimination,
when
the
secretary
of
commerce
wants
to
hold
a
decennial
census
every
15
years
rather
than
every
10
years,
or
where
it's
clear
that
the
secretary
is
not
trying
to
count
anybody.
those
may
well
be
appropriate
matters
for
courts
to
consider.
but
what
the
respondents
have
really
invited
the
courts
to
do
in
this
case...
and
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
accepted
the
invitation...
was
for
the
courts
to
take
sides
in
a
statistical
dispute
among
statisticians
and
demographers
about
the
propriety
of
a
statistical
adjustment.
we
do
not
think
that
that's
the
type
of
dispute
that
properly
belongs
in
federal
court.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
o'connor,
certainly
that's
the
way
that
we
would
describe
the
standard.
we
think
that
applying
it
in
this
particular
case,
looking
at
the
three
decisions
that
i
just
mentioned,
insofar
as
the
secretary
is
relying
upon
distributive
accuracy
as
the
principal
objective,
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
consistent
with
the
constitutional
language
and
the
goal
of
equal
representation,
that
that's
what
the
constitution
has
in
mind
how
does
the
congress
and
the
secretary
of
commerce
go
about
figuring
out
how
representatives
should
be
allocated
among
the
states,
apportioned
among
the
states.
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
constitutional
language.
and
when
we
talk
about
the
need
for
the
statistical
adjustment
to
be
superior
to
the
actual
count,
we
think
that
that
is
consonant
with
but
not
dictated
by
the
text
and
history
of
the
constitution.
after
all,
what
the
secretary
of
commerce
is
doing
or
was
doing
in
1990
was
relying
upon
experience
that
the
census
bureau
had
gained
ever
since
marshals
went
around
in
1790
from
door
to
door
asking
people
who
lived
in
their
households.
that's
what
the
secretary
was
doing.
it
may
not
be
that
the
secretary
has
to
do
precisely
what
was
done
in
1790
or
1980,
but
there
has
to
be
some
approximation
and
that's
exactly
what
was
going
on
here.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
right.
reasonableness,
and
although
the
district
court
here
used
arbitrary
and
capricious,
we
think
that
that's
about
as
far
as
the
court
should
go,
but
we
would
argue
for
a
more
deferential
standard,
one
that
apparently
eluded
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
yes.
i
think
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes,
i
think
the
secretary
could
do
that.
that's
consistent
with
the
constitutional
tradition,
the
history.
it's
rational.
of
course,
the
secretary
could
balance
off
those
considerations,
as
he
did
here
and
went
through
a
list
of
eight
considerations,
and
decided,
after
looking
at
all
of
those,
that
adjusting
was
not
the
right
thing
to
do.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
justice--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
a
new
secretary
of
commerce
came
in
and
found
himself
faced
with
a
lawsuit
and
felt
that
he
would
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
try
to
sort
through
this
and
hear
what
the
experts
had
to
say
and
evaluate
it.
and
after
going
through
an
administrative
process
that
produced
18,000
pages
of
administrative
record
and
had
650
comments
from
outsiders
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
looking
at
this,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
did.
one
of
the
most
troubling
things
for
us
about
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
that
it
seems
to
want
to
assimilate
wholesale
the
rigid
standards
of
the
karcher
decision
into
an
evaluation
of
disputes
over
the
census.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
karcher.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
karcher
v.
daggett
where,
in
effect,
there
has
to
be
mathematical
equality.
and
as
this
court
mentioned
in
montana,
although
it
may
be
common
sensical
in
some
ways
to
seek
a
precise
mathematical
test
within
each
state,
when
you
try
to
apply
that
same
standard
to
the
nation
as
a
whole,
the
common
sense
force
of
that
becomes
quite
illusory.
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
recognized
that
there
were
differences
between
the
problems
that
the
federal
government
faces
with
respect
to
the
census
and
those
that
states
confront,
but
did
not
give,
in
our
estimation,
a
proper
weight
to
those
considerations.
after
all,
unlike
a
state,
when
we're
talking
about
the
reapportionment
of
congress,
there
are
certain
constraints,
three
major
ones.
there
has
to
be
at
least
one
representative
per
state.
there
has
to
be
not
exceeding
one
representative
for
every
30,000
people,
and
the
district
boundaries
may
not
cross
state
lines.
these
in
and
of
themselves
make
it
very
hard
to
imagine
that
there
is
any
ability
to
achieve
mathematical
equality.
but
the
court
of
appeals,
nevertheless,
said
that
the
secretary
had
to
make
a
good
faith
effort
and
found
that
the
secretary
had
not
made
a
good
faith
effort
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
well,
i
think
that
this
1990
census
reflects
probably
the
most
forceful
and
dedicated
effort
to
do
that
in
history.
there
was
an
effort
before
the
census
was
started
to
identify
households.
municipalities
and
states
were
given
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
list.
they
were
able
to
do
that
afterwards.
there
were
special
get
out
the
census
count
campaigns
specifically
targeted
to
hard
to
count
populations
around
the
country.
that's
why
i
think
the
ultimate
census,
although,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
know
whether
it's
exactly
98.4,
by
all
estimates
it's
98.4.
we're
talking
about
missing
4
million
people
approximately
in
a
population
of
248
to
253
million,
which
is
a
pretty
good
record.
but
let
me
say
in
closing
something
about
this
differential
undercount
because
it
has
really
driven
this
lawsuit,
and
i
think
the
secretary
reflected
his
concern
about
this,
as
well
he
should
have
been
concerned.
and
i
think
all
of
us
are
concerned.
but
what
he
established
was
that
the
statistical
adjustment
could
not
show
that
there
would
be
reliable
distributive
accuracy.
what
that
means
is,
if
there's
not
distributive
accuracy
at
the
state
level,
one
doesn't
know
where
to
place
the
minorities
who
are
presumably
undercounted.
it's
not
clear
whether
one
puts
the
so
called
undercount
groups
in
new
york
or
south
l.a.
or
other
parts
of
the
country,
and
that
can
produce
great
distortions.
if
one
looks
at
the
adjusted
count's
impact
on
new
york
city,
for
example,
new
york
state
gained
population
under
the
adjustment.
may
i
finish
this
comment,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
gained
population
but
it
lost
share.
that
is,
it
lost
its
ranking
relative
to
the
other
states
in
the
union.
we
think
for
these
reasons
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
for
the
entry
of
judgment
in
favor
of
petitioners.
thank
you
very
much.
