mr.
james
e.
doyle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
people
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
stand
to
lose
a
seat
in
congress
to
the
state
of
california,
which
is
no
longer
even
pursuing
its
claim
because
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
other
respondents
seek
to
engraft
on
the
constitution
certain
statistical
procedures
about
how
to
take
the
census
over
which
even
statisticians
disagree.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
we
do
not
agree
with
standing
in
the...
in
apportionment.
we
believe
that
that
standing
belongs
to
the
state,
not
the
individual
voters,
as
it
does
in
the
karcher
case
in
which
you
can
actually
assess
what
your
proportional
share
of
the
voting
statistic
is.
but
in
the
case
of
apportionment
to
the
state,
we
believe
that
belongs
to
the
state.
as
in
montana
and
in
franklin
v.
massachusetts,
both
of
those
claims
were
pursued
by
the
states
that
stood
to
lose
a
seat
in
congress
if
it
had
been...
if
the
procedure
had
been
adopted.
in
this
case,
california
pursued
its
claim
in
the
district
court,
was...
did
not
appeal
the
district
court's
ruling
against
it,
and
we
believe
the
state
of
california
is
bound
by
that
judgment.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
in
our
view,
it
is
in
this
case
the
states'
interest
and
the
individual
voter
does
not
have
the
standing.
but
let
me
emphasize
in
this
case
california's
case
was
brought
state
ex
rel.
for
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state.
that's
how
the
case
was
brought.
so
the
attorney
general
was
bringing
it
not
on
behalf
of
the
corporate
entity
of
the
state
of
california,
but
was
bringing
it
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
california.
and
he...
and
california
did
not
appeal
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
apportion...
in
my
view
the
apportionment
right,
the
right
to
a
certain
number
of
seats
in
congress
does
not
convert
into
the
same
kind
of
statistical
how
many
representatives
do
i
have,
what
share
of
a
representative
do
i
have
in
congress.
and
there
is
always
going
to
be
wide--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
because
as
i
said,
i
believe
it's
the
state's
right.
but
let
me
emphasize
this
case.
the
voters
have...
the
attorney
general
was
representing
the
people
of
the
state
of
california,
and
certainly
the
voters
of
new
york
do
not
have
any
standing
to
claim
that
wisconsin
should
transfer
a
seat
in
congress
from
wisconsin
to
california.
the
only
practical
result
of
this
statistical
adjustment,
as
it
was
later
corrected...
the
only
practical
result
of
this
statistical
adjustment,
as
it
was
later
corrected
is
that
one
seat
in
congress
will
be
transferred
from
wisconsin
to
california.
there
is--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--federal
funding
is
not
a
constitutional
issue.
there
is
no...
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
violation.
you
have
no...
no
individual
has--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--not
if
there
is
not
any
showing
of
purposeful,
intentional
discrimination.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
per
capita
receipt
of
government
largesse.
there's
no
right
that
a
citizen
in
wisconsin
has
to
get
equal
number
of
dollars
from
the
federal
government
that
a
citizen
in
illinois
gets.
it
is...
it
may
be
a
statutory
claim,
perhaps
reviewable
under
the
apa,
but
it
is
not
a
constitutional
claim.
the
only
constitutional--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--it
may
have
the
nexus
for
injury
to
bring
a
claim,
not
the
constitutional
claim
having
to
do
with
apportionment,
which
is
the
claim
before
this
court,
but
a
statutory
claim.
it
may
have
the
nexus
of
injury
for
standing.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
successful
lawsuit,
but
it
may
be
the
nexus
for
standing
of
a
non
constitutional
claim.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
you
may
well
have
a
different
basis.
you
may
well
have...
even
under
the
franklin
case,
you
may
have
a
administrative
procedures
act
lawsuit.
i
don't
know--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--that
is
true
currently,
your
honor.
there
are
various
census
numbers
that
are
used
for
the
distribution
of
federal
funds.
there's
a
mid
decennial
census
that
is
taken
that
is
not
a
constitutional
census
that
is
used
for
purposes
of
various
government
programs.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
if
the
statute
said
the
official
census--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--then
we
believe
that
you
could
conceivably
have
two
different
results,
although
i
think
it's
unlikely.
but
the
issue
before
the
court
is
one
of
whether
or
not
in
this
case
there
has
been--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--my
understanding
of
the
statutes
having
to
do
with
disbursal
of
federal
funds
is
you
would
not
have
that
lawsuit,
but
perhaps
under
a
hypothetical
statute,
you
might
well.
you
will
have
many,
many
lawsuits
coming
before
you
constantly
if...
before
the
courts
if
the
second
circuit's
decision
is
adopted.
if
in
the
year
2000
the
census
is
harmful
to
the
state
of...
the
statistical
estimation
is
done
and
the
statute
is
harmful...
the
census
is
harmful
to
the
state
of
wisconsin,
we
may
well
be
before
the
court
if
the
second
circuit
decision
is
there,
arguing
that
if
you
use
different
post
strata,
if
you
had
grouped
wisconsin
with
different
states,
if
you
had
had
a
different
way
of
imputing
the
people
who
you
can't
match,
that
we
would
be...
have
a
seat
in
congress.
and
under
the
second
circuit's
decision,
not
only
would
we
have
a
claim,
but
by
simply
coming
forward
with
a
claim
that
we
can
do
the
census
better
than
the
census
bureau
did,
count
more
people,
we
would
have
heightened
scrutiny
applied
to
that
claim
as
well.
and
if
i
might
address
the
question
about
whether
the
adjustment
of
the
census
itself
would
be
constitutional,
the
statistical
estimation,
whether
it
could
constitutionally
be
done.
there
is
a
significant
constitutional
problem
with
that.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
2,
requires
that
the
census
be
done
by
a
counting
of
the
people
in
the
states.
the
way
the
wisconsin
number
would
be
arrived
at,
if
you
accepted
this
statistical
estimation,
is
that
our
count
would
not
only
be
because
of
counts
in
our
state,
but
through
this
post
strata
system
by
which
people
are
counted
in
ohio
and
indiana
and
illinois
and
michigan,
our
numbers
are
adjusted
basis...
based
on
counts
that
are
made
in
the
post
strata
in
other
states.
in
fact,
in
the
post...
in
the
pes
only
i
believe
169
blocks
of
wisconsin,
about
5,000
people,
were
included
in
the
post
enumeration
survey.
and
our
numbers
were
being
estimated
based
on
that.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
am
suggesting
that
the
secretary
does
not
have
discretion
to
do
the
kind
of
statistical
sampling
that
was
done
in
this
case.
there--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--no.
there
may
well
be
other
kinds
of
statistical
sampling
that...
i'm
not
a
statistician...
that
may
serve
the
purpose,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
can
arrive
at
the
census
of
wisconsin
based
on
counts
of
people
that
you
have
made
in
illinois,
indiana,
and
michigan,
which
is
what--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--it's
inconsistent
with
actual
enumeration,
but
particularly
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
2,
which
says
counting
the
whole
number
of
people--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--in
the
states.
you
count
people
in
illinois.
you
say,
oh,
there
has
been
an
undercount
in
illinois.
you
group
wisconsin
with
illinois,
and
our
undercount's
percentage
is
based
on
counts
of
people
that
are
made
in
other
states.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
wisconsin
worked
very
hard.
and
let
me
say
that
there's
a
suggestion
that
the
majority
states...
that
there's
a
majoritarianism
issue
here.
every
state
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
everybody
in
that
state
is
counted,
minority
and
non
minority
citizens
alike.
when
a
minority
citizen
in
wisconsin
is
not
counted,
my
vote...
my
representation
is
as
depreciated
as
that
minority
student...
that
minority
citizen
who
is
not
counted.
so,
every
state
has
an
interest
in
seeing
a
full
count
made.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
thank
you,
your
honor.
