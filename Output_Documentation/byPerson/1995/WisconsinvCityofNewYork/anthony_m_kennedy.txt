justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
that
the
secretary
gave
an
accurate
interpretation
of
the
constitution.
i
took
it
the
thrust
of
her
question
was
what
standard
should
the
court
use
in
assessing
the
adequacy
of
his
determination.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume
your
answer
would
be
that
there
would
be
rational
basis--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
the
individual
voters
who
claim
their
districts
have
been
undercounted
have
standing
to
bring
this
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
individual
voters
then
not
have
the
standing
because
the
states
necessarily
supersede
their
interests?
