general
days,
is
it
clear
or
does
the
government
concede
that
the
use
of
statistical
estimates
is
permissible,
let
alone
that
it's
mandatory?
i
mean,
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--text
of
the
constitution,
as
i
read
it,
doesn't...
does
not
say,
you
know,
that
there
will
be
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
citizens.
it
talks
about
actual
enumeration.
it
doesn't
even
use
the
word
"census".
it
says
actual
enumeration.
do
you
think
that
that
could
be
complied
with
by
congress
saying,
well,
we
think
the
population
of
the
country
overall
has
increased
5
percent
and,
therefore,
we
think
every
state...
chances
are
every
state
has
increased
more
or
less
5
percent?
close
enough
for
government
work.
could
they
do
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
didn't
have
an
actual
enumeration,
but
what
they
called
for
was
an
actual
enumeration.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
that's
another
lawsuit,
though.
right?
i
mean,
this
one
will
decide
whether
you
must
use
statistical
estimates
and
the
next
one
will
decide
whether
you
may
use
it.
i
assume
somebody
will
have
an
interest
in
saying
that
you
can't
do
it
next
time
around,
if
you
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
he
may
come
regret
being
so
open
to
the
various
options
for
estimation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
he
hasn't
been
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
would
you
have
a
different
basis
for
challenging
the
census
as
it
is
used
under
some
of
these
statutes
than
you
would
have
for
challenging
it
in
this
lawsuit
which
does
not
relate
to
a
statute
but
to
the
constitutional
prescription?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
could
come
out
with
different
results?
you'd
have
a
census,
and
you'd
have
two
different
censuses,
one
of
which
would
be
valid
for
apportionment
purposes
and
the
other
one
of
which
would
be
valid
for
all
of
the
statutory
apportionments?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
assume
the
statute
just
says
according
to
the
census
figures.
is
it
possible
that
that
would
mean
one
thing
for
statutory
distribution
purposes
and
something
else
for
purposes
of
apportionment?
what
is
the
census?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
so,
we
could
have
another
lawsuit
about
it.
we
can
do
all
this
over
again
when
somebody
comes
up
with
a
statutory
apportionment
that
requires
it
to
be
apportioned
according
to
the
census.
and
you
say
they
can
distinguish
whatever
we
say
in
today's
case
because
this
only
related
to
the
official
census.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
just
say
enumerate.
it
says
actual
enumeration.
justice
antonin
scalia
actual
enumeration.
and
you
want
to
say
that
since
you
cannot
do
a
perfect
actual
enumeration,
you
will
take
the
actual
enumeration
and
adjust
it
upward
or
downward
by
statistical
means.
i
don't
think
that
that...
it
isn't
clear
to
me
at
least
that
that
constitutes
an
actual
enumeration.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
imaginary
enumeration.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
we
have
a
different--
--what
was
the
estimation?
i'm
not
sure.
what
was
that
imputation?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
most
purposes,
but
that's
the
crucial
phrase
there.
what
the
secretary
did
not
concede
was
that
this
adjusted
method
was
more
accurate
for
the
central
purpose
of
distributing
representatives
among
the
states
more
accurately.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
that
purpose,
he
thought
that
the
actual
enumeration
was
better
without
statistical
adjustment.
isn't
that...
wasn't
that
in
essence
what
he
said?
