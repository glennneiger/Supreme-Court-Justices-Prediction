mr.

we'll

from

chief

william

rehnquist
well,
on
what
basis
did
the
district
court
go
about
finding
that
the
secretary's
decision
was
wrong,
as
you
put
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
we
should
refine
what
you
mean
by
saying
that
the
district
court
found
the
secretary's
decision
was,
quote,
wrong,
close
quote.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
add
up
to
being
wrong?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
it's
simply
a
factual
inquiry
that's
up
to
the
district
court
to
decide
whether
one
count
was
more
accurate
than
the
other,
regardless
of
what
the
secretary
chose
to
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
saying,
mr.
rifkind,
that
a
political
appointee
secretary,
who
is
authorized
by
congress
to
take
a
particular
action,
if
he
rejects
the
recommendations
of
his
permanent
staff,
is
therefore
very
likely
of
being
held
arbitrary
and
capricious?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
what
is
the
government
action
here
which
you
say
undermines
fundamental
rights?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
assumes
that
they're
entitled
to
some
different
form
of
count
than
they
got.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you're
right
on
that.
i
think
the
secretaries
and...
the
congress
is
given
great
discretion
by
the
constitution.
congress
in
turn
confers
great
discretion
on
the
secretary,
and
the
idea
that
you
simply
decide
all
over
again
in
the
district
court
whether
the
secretary
was
right
or
wrong
i
think
is
quite
unsupported
by
any
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rifkind.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
94-1614,
wisconsin
versus
the
city
of
new
york
and
companion
cases.
in
preparing
to
conduct
the
1990
census,
the
secretary
of
commerce
determined
that
past
censuses
which
were
essentially
headcount
consistently
had
undercounted
the
actual
population
and
that
some
minorities
had
been
undercounted
at
a
greater
rate
than
the
rest
of
the
population.
as
part
of
an
effort
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
1990
census,
the
secretary
considered
the
possibility
of
using
a
statistical
adjustment
of
the
actual
count
in
order
to
correct
for
the
undercount.
but
he
decided
against
that
possibility
after
deciding
that
he
could
not
be
certain
but
the
statistical
adjustment
would
improve
the
quality
of
the
census.
several
cities
and
individuals
sued
arguing
that
secretary’s
decision
not
to
use
the
statistical
adjustment
was
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
rejected
their
argument
but
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
the
district
court.
it
noted
that
the
constitution
requires
census
data
to
be
used
to
apportion
members
of
the
house
of
representative
and
then
looking
at
this
court’s
decisions
requiring
states
to
adhere
that
the
principle
of
one
person
one
vote
decided
that
the
secretary’s
decision
not
to
use
the
adjustment
infringe
on
the
rights
of
individuals
to
have
their
votes
counted
equally.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
reasoning
underlying
our
one
person
one
vote
cases
does
not
apply
to
the
federal
government’s
decisions
regarding
the
conduct
of
the
census.
the
constitution
vests
congress
with
virtually
unlimited
discretion
over
the
conduct
of
the
census
and
through
the
census
act,
congress
has
delegated
its
broad
authority
over
the
census
to
the
secretary
of
commerce.
the
secretary’s
conduct
of
the
census
is
constitutional
so
long
as
there
is
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
accomplishment
of
an
actual
count
of
the
population.
here
the
secretary
based
his
decision
against
statistical
adjustment
on
three
conclusions:
first,
he
decided
it
was
more
important
for
the
census
to
accurately
measure
the
proportion
of
people
in
different
areas
than
it
was
for
the
census
to
accurately
measure
the
total
number
or
people
in
the
united
states.
second,
he
found
that
statistical
adjustment
of
the
preliminary
census
data
was
something
that
had
never
been
tried
before,
and
finally
he
determined
that
statistical
adjustment
would
not
improve
the
distributive
accuracy
of
the
census.
we
found
the
first
state
conclusion
consistent
with
the
constitutional
purpose
of
the
census,
and
we
find
the
second
and
third
conclusions
to
be
reasonable.
therefore
we
hold
the
secretary’s
decision
not
statistically
adjust
the
1990
census
is
constitutional.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
