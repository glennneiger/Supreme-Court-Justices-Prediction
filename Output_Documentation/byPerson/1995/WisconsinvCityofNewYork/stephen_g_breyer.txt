is
there
a
way
if
in
fact
you
did
an
actual
enumeration,
i.e.,
you
went
out
and
counted
people,
and
you
also
thought
that
the
inner
cities
were
being
undercounted
because
people
couldn't
find
everyone...
it's
hard
for
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
a
way
in
a
system
of
actual
enumeration
to
do
better
at
counting
the
people
in
the
inner
cities
that's
a
practical
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
that
be
the
test?
i
mean,
if
in
fact
the
true
cause
is
that
people
who
live
in
inner
cities
and
are
hard
to
get
to
are
undercounted,
people
who
live
in
inner
cities
and
are
hard
to
get
to
also
have
more
diseases
and
also
eat
less
well.
so,
in
fact,
a
census
system
that
adjusted
upwards
by
1
percent
according
to
diet
would
be
more
accurate.
yet,
a
system
like
that
couldn't
possibly
be
a
more
lawful
system
because
you'd
produce
bizarre
results
in
trying
to
apportion
representatives
among
the
states.
so,
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be
the
test
as
opposed
to
the
test
being
are
we
going
to
do
our
apportionment
business
of
representatives
in
congress
better.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
as
soon
as
you
say
that,
you
run
into
their
argument
about,
you
know,
who
gets
the
extra
representative,
and
there
are
a
thousand
different
ways
to
do
it,
and
it's
undercounted
here
and
overcounted
there,
and
we
don't
know
the
true
causes
of
the
undercount,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
said
to
whom
a
great
deference
is
due,
and
as
soon
as
we
get
into
a
great
deference
is
due,
they
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
unreasonable?
that's...
i
mean,
suppose
there
are
two
things
causing
undercount,
a
and
b,
and
california
has
all
a
and
new
york
has
all
b.
and
what
we
do
is
we
adjust
on
a
and
we
don't
adjust
on
b.
we
might
discover
all
the
seats
go
to
california,
new
york
loses.
but
the
reality
is
that
they
shouldn't
shift
at
all.
and
so,
obviously,
the
simple
fact
that
you
get
a
more
accurate
count
doesn't
solve
the
apportionment
problem.
indeed,
all
statistics
has
that
problem,
doesn't
it?
you
have
to
figure
out
how
to
draw
the
boxes
and
what
your
causal
theory
is
before
you
do
the
sampling.
and
as
soon
as
you
get
into
that,
you
know
it
or
you
don't
know
it.
if
you
know
it,
why
not
just
send
out
the
census
takers?
if
you
don't
know
it,
it
can
be
manipulated.
