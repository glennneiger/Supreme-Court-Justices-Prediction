justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
going
further,
general
days,
and
using
this
pes
adjustment,
at
least
the
district
judge,
mclaughlin,
was
confident
that
that
was
an
appropriate
way.
he
said,
if
i
were
free
to
decide
on
my
own,
that's
what
i
would
use.
and
he
had
a
footnote,
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
particularly
about
that.
he
said,
in
light
of
recent
improvements
in
statistical
tools,
that
the
use
of
the
adjustment
in
the
next
census
is
probably
inevitable.
so,
my
question
is,
has
the
government...
it's
now
1996.
there
must
be
some
planning
for
the
next
census.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
what
is
the
government's
current
view
on
that,
the
propriety
of
such
an
adjustment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
was
after
you
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
sampling
in
1990.
there
was
no
sampling
that
was
used.
it
was
the
enumeration
that
was
used
and
then
any
adjustment
was
considered
not
sufficiently
reliable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
what
was
the
source
of
the
trial
judge's
confidence
that
the
use
of
an
adjustment
after
the
enumeration
would
be
inevitable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
doyle,
then
are
you
disagreeing
with
general
days
who
said,
in
answer
to
the
question
might
the
sampling
technique
or
some
statistical
adjustment
be
used,
yes,
it
might?
that's
the
secretary
is
considering.
and
there
was
also
the
prediction,
the
forecast,
that
we
wouldn't
get
a
lot
of
lawsuits
because
if
we
gave
proper
deference
to
the
secretary,
then
that
would
be
that,
as
long
as
it
met
a
reasonableness
test.
but
i
think
you
are
now
suggesting
that
the
secretary
doesn't
have
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
kind
of
statistical
sampling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
not...
mr.
rifkind,
that
was
not
an
issue
that
was
aired
below
since
it
was
accepted
by
the
government--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
secretary
spent
all
the
time
considering
this.
so,
that
isn't
an
issue.
but
i
was
interested
in
your
answer
about
this
fundamental
right,
and
we
know
the
result.
it
was
also
known
that
an
absolute
veterans'
preference
in
massachusetts
would
mean
that
of...
the
upper
echelon
jobs,
and
the
vast
majority
would
be
reserved
to
a
group
overwhelmingly
male.
and
we
have
washington
v.
davis.
how
can
you
argue
that
even
though
you
know
that
the
undercount
will
disproportionately
affect
minority
members,
that
for
that
reason
you
get
this
highest
level
of
scrutiny
when
this
court
has
rejected
that
over
and
over
again?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
general
days
has
told
us
that
you
can't
compare
the
national
census
with
apportionment
one
person/one
vote
within
a
state,
and
general
doyle
tells
us
that
what
we
have
to
concentrate
on,
the
only
thing
at
the
constitutional
level
before
us,
is
taking
away
from
wisconsin
one
seat,
adding
to
california
one
seat.
that's
what
he
said
is
before
us,
nothing
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
explain
then.
the
secretary
said
i'm
concentration...
concentrating
on
distributional
accuracy
within
the
united
states.
the
result
of
doing
this
pes
will
mean
that
california
gets
another
seat,
wisconsin
gets
one
seat
less.
now,
why
is
anything
more
than
that
involved?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
so
will.
they're
not
required
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rifkind,
why
couldn't
the
state
say,
we
take
the
enumeration
and
then
for
our
own
purposes
of
apportioning,
we
will
take
this
adjustment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
because
they
don't
have
the
numbers
to
do
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
maybe
each
state
should
redecide
how
that
statute
should
be
and
say
that
we
want
to
have
the
enumeration
plus
the
statistical
adjustment.
and
then
it's
a
question
for
the
state's
political
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
told
me
the
practical
result
on
the
state
level,
but
i'm
looking
for
the
constitutional
infirmity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rifkind,
isn't
that
quite
an
exaggeration
to
say
i'm
going
to
stay
with
the
worst
method?
he
said,
i'm
going
to
stay
with
the
method
we
have
unless
i
am
convinced
that
something
is
better.
and
even
judge
mclaughlin
didn't
say
the
secretary
was
wrong.
what
he
said
was
if
i
were
the
decision
maker,
i
would
probably...
not
certainly...
i
would
probably
have
ordered
the
adjustment.
that's
the
furthest
he
goes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
rifkind,
then
we
get
back
to
the
point
that
i
made
before.
that's
not
because
the
federal
authorities
are
compelling
that.
that's
because
the
states,
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
have
chosen
that
that's
the
way
they're
going
to
do
their
interstate.
there's
nothing
that
shows
that
the
states
could
not
one
by
one
have
picked
what
you
say
is
the
better
way
of
doing
it.
they
have
the
numbers.
they
could
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
practice...
how
does
the
practice
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
decision?
we're
saying
we
know
that
states
could
do
this,
but
they
won't.
politically
they
won't.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
thought
you
agreed
that
you
got
the
numbers
for
them
and
those
numbers,
i
take
it,
are
not
going
to
be
any
less
available
in
the
future.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
new
york
would
violate
one
person/one
vote
if
it
used
those?
do
you
think
that
anyone
could
mount
such
a
challenge?
