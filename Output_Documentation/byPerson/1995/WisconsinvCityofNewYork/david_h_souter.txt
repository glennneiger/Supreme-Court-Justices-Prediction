--would
you
take
the
position
that
it
would
satisfy
the
standard,
at
least
in
the
absence
of
the
kind
of
extraordinary
circumstances
like
evidence
of
intentional
undercounting,
discrimination,
and
so
on...
would
you
take
the
position
that
it
would
satisfy
the
standard
for
the
secretary
to
take
the
position
as
a
matter
of
principle
that
because
all
of
these
adjustment
techniques
ultimately
involve
kinds
of
value
choices
and
are
therefore
politically
manipulable,
that
it
would
simply
be
safer
to
go
with
the
kind
of
garden
variety
actual
enumeration,
to
the
exclusion
of
adjustments
as
a
matter
of
principle,
to
avoid
the
risk
of
political
manipulation?
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
he
bases
his
decision
on
that
principled
reasoning,
that
satisfy
rational
basis
regardless
of
what
arguments
might
be
made
that
this
technique
would
be
helpful
and
that
technique
might
not
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
an
individual
voter
have
standing
on
the
theory
that
if
there
are
more
representatives
for
that
voter's
states,
the
ratio
of
representative
to
voters
will
be
more
favorable
and,
therefore,
the
voter,
as
well
as
the
state,
has
a
stake?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
are
conceptually
different
but
they
are
related
because
the
ratio
will
depend
on
the
apportionment.
so,
it
may
be
that
the
voter
is
not
bringing
in
a
technical
sense
an
apportionment
claim.
the
voter
is
bringing
a
variety
of
person
to
vote
claim.
but
why
doesn't
the
voter
have
standing
to
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
federal
funding
that's
based
on
population
and
so
forth?
isn't
that
an
injury?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
that
show
injury?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
a
claim,
but
does
it
suffice
to
have
the
nexus
of
injury
for
him
to
bring
the
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
term
"actual
enumeration".
no.
counting
the
whole
number.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it,
you
have
a...
sort
of
a
footnote
to
that
argument
too
because
i
gather
wisconsin
claims
that
it
made
unusual
efforts
to
get
out
the
census
so
that
the
very
fact
that
you
tried
to
do
a
good
job
would
be
a
further
reason,
in
fact
as
well
as
in
principle,
to
say
you
shouldn't
compare
us
with
another
state
that
might
not
have
made
that
effort.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
rifkind,
your
whole
argument
seems
to
rest
on
the
assumption
that
we're
dealing
with
two
sets
of
figures
which
are
alike
in
every
respect
except
one
is
more
accurate
than
the
other,
and
that
in
fact
is
not
so,
is
it?
we
are,
in
fact,
dealing
with
a
set
of
figures
which
are
derived,
one
of
them
by
actual
count,
the
other
one
by
estimate,
which
depends
upon
a
series
of
value
judgments
in
order
to
determine
how
to
make
the
estimate.
so,
we
are
not
comparing
a
big
apple
against
a
little
apple.
we
are
comparing
two
different
kinds
of
vegetables,
aren't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
be
fair
then
to
say
that
the
difference
between
these
two
figures
is
a
difference
on
the...
a
difference
depending
on
the
amount
of
estimation
versus
actual
enumeration
which
in
fact
is
involved
in
reaching
the
number?
justice
david
h.
souter
by
definition,
there's...
i
presume
there's
more
estimation
in
the
method
that
you
want
used
or
you
wouldn't
want
it
used.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
may
i
go
back
to
the
comparisons
of
these
two
estimations,
one
of
which
is
more
ambitious
than
the
other?
if
we
assume
that
the
two
figures
are
properly
comparable
so
that
we
can
say
one
is
better
than
the
other,
we
have
to
assume
something
about
the
judgments
that
are
made
in
deciding
how
to
make
the
preferable
estimate.
we
have
to
say,
yes,
those
value
choices
were
good
value
choices.
isn't
it
the
case
then
that
you
have
a
problem
in
your
argument,
just
taking
it
on
its
own
terms,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that,
if
i
recall
correctly,
the
head
of
the
census
bureau
said,
i
wouldn't
have
done
it
this
way,
but
the
secretary's
choice
is
within
the
realm
of
reason?
in
other
words,
it
could...
a
reasonable
person
could
make
a
different
set
of
value
choices
from
the
ones
which
i
personally
prefer.
it
would
still
be
within
the
realm
of
reason.
isn't
that
a
difficulty
for
your
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
why
you
have
to
insist
on
the
heightened
scrutiny
standard
because
otherwise
you
lose.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
a
high
risk.
maybe
a
high
risk,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
we
don't
have
any
finding
from
the
people...
the
judge
who
heard
the
testimony
that
in
fact
it's
not
to
be
believed.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
she
felt
very
emphatically
that
they
had
come
to
one,
and
indeed
in
her
view
preferable
obviously,
solution
to
an
assumed
problem
of
undercounting.
but
to
say
that
they
had
solved
the
problem
is
truly
to
say
they
had
come
up
with
one
solution
to
a
problem
and
there
were
other
solutions,
and
it
was
within
the
realm
of
reason
to
say
that
in
fact
the
cure
might
be
worse
than
the
disease.
