chief

rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
95-6,
norfolk
and
western
railway
company
v.
william
j.
hiles.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
if
there's
just
a
malfunction
and
no
evidence
produced
on
the
part
of
the
railroad,
there
could
be
liability.
what
would
be
the
theory
or
the
explanation
of
liability
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
your
case
differs
from
the
hypothetical
in
that
there
was
no
malfunction
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
in
the
record,
mr.
phillips?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
mann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
in
the
record...
is
that
a
photograph
of
something
that's
in
the
record?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
exhibit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
know
that
from
the
record?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
know
that
from
the
record
what
you
just--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i...
yes,
i
suspect
you...
i
suggest
you
confine
yourself
to
the
record.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
exactly
is
the
performance
requirement
that
you
deduce
from
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
it's
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--even
if
it's
a
misalignment
and
not
an
actual
failure
of
the
coupler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
don't
think
they've
extended
beyond
failure
of
the
couplers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
respect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
wasn't
designed
to
couple
if
the
thing
is
misaligned.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mann,
in
o'donnell
the
court
says
on
page
389,
we
hold
that
the
safety
appliance
act
requires
couplers
which,
after
a
secure
coupling
is
effected,
will
remain
coupled
until
set
free
by
some
purposeful
act
of
control.
it
seems
to
me
that's
far
short
of
standing
for
what
you
say
it
stands
for.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
then
goes
on
to
say,
negligence
is
not
required,
which
everybody
concedes
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
it
says
the
act
requires
a
coupler,
once
it
couples,
stays
coupled,
but
that
really
doesn't
cover
your
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
with
respect
to
couplers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
drawbars.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it...
as
i
understand
it,
it's
misalignment
of
the
drawbars,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
anything
that
happens
between
the
cars
is
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
lewis
case
is
a
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
binding
on
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
mann.
thank
you.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
