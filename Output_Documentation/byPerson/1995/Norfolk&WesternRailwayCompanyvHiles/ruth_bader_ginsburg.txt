justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
jones
act
picks
up
on
the
same
thing.
so,
it's
for
seamen
as
well
as
railroad
workers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
the
lewis
case
and
as
far
as
fines
are
concerned,
you're
certainly
right,
but
what
do
you
make
of
this
statement
in
lewis
that
the
railroad's
duty
is,
as
far
as
the
worker
is
concerned
and
the
worker's
injury...
it's
a
duty
not
just
to
provide
proper
equipment,
but
to
guarantee
its
performance.
that
seems
to
say
the...
there
can
be
no
fine
against
the
railroad
but
there
is
a
guarantee
to
the
worker.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
politely
that
judge
mackinnon
was
incorrect
to
the
extent
that
he
said
that
the...
that
there
is
a
guarantee
of
the
performance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
i
think
judge
mackinnon
was
writing
as
of...
what...
1983,
and
he
said
that
after
90
years
that
the
automatic
realigning
devices,
as
distinguished
from
automatic
coupling
devices,
are
still
in
the
experimental
stage
and
had
been
installed
on
less
than
1
percent
of
the
railroad
cars.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
as
of
1983
he
was
writing,
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
since
that
time
there
has
not
been
any
significant
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mann,
apart
from
what
the
courts
have
done,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
isn't
the
lewis
case
highly
relevant
because
that
was
an
agency
regulation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
a
regulation
that
said
it's
okay
to
use
this
hook
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
do
i
understand
your
reasoning
with
respect
to
the
drawbar
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
result
that
was
reached
in
lewis
that
it
was
not...
it
was
okay
to
have
this
regulation
that
permitted
the
hook
procedure,
even
though
it
involved
going
between
the
cars
at
least
with
part
of
one's
body?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mann,
aren't
you
leaving
something
out
when
you
say
the
employee
doesn't
have
to
show
any
defect
and
you
cited
the
affolder
case?
but
the
employer
then,
the
railroad,
can
show
there
was
no
defect,
and
that's
a
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
case
holds
that
the
employer
comes
in...
employee
comes
in
and
the
employee
then...
railroad
then
says
there
was
no
defect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
case
that
says
it
is
not
a
defense
that
the
appliance
was
not
defective?
