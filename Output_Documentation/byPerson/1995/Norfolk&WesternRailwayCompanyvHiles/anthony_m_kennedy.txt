justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
just
refresh
my
memory?
if
the
employee
doesn't
recover
in
this
suit,
what
recovery
does
he
have?
is
there
a
workmen's
compensation
scheme?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
he
still
bring
that
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
to
show
some
negligence
under
fela?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
there's
an
on-the-job
injury
with
no
negligence,
is
there
ever
a
workmen's
compensation
scheme?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me
a
little
bit
about
your
rule
of
causation
and
tell
me
what
the
rule
of
causation
is?
suppose
the
employee
sees
the
misaligned
drawbar
and
he
walks
quickly
to
correct
it
before
he
gets
between
the
cars
and
stumbles
and
hurts
himself.
is
there
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
he
stumbles
in
between
the
cars,
is
there
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there's
cause
in
fact.
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
drawbar,
he--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--wouldn't
have
moved
and
wouldn't
have
stumbled.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
there
must...
so,
you
must
be
saying
that
there
is
some
requirement
of
proximate
causation
between
the
defective
operation
of
the
mechanism
and
the
injury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
it's
misaligned,
he
has
to
go
between
the
cars,
and
he
gets
bit
by
a
snake.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
his
bad
back
a
supervening
cause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
you
say
supervening
cause,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--supervening
causes
are...
there
is
a
chain
of
factual
causality
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
same
case
in
the
snake
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
part
of
what
we're
talking
about
i
assume.
