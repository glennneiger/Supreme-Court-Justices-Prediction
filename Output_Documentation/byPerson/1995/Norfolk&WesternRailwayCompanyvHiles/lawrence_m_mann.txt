mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
a
photograph
that
may
assist
the
court.
this
is
the
actual
car
that
was
involved
in
the
accident.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
an
exhibit,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
and
what
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
the
rail
industry
has
dealt
with
only
one
aspect
of
coupling
and
uncoupling.
they
have
dealt
with
the
uncoupling
process.
they
have
provided
a
lever
here
that
you
see
which
allows
the
coupler
to
uncouple
without
the
necessity
of
anyone
going
in
between
the
cars.
what
they
haven't
addressed
is
the
coupling
procedure.
they
have
not
touched
the
coupling
device
to
prevent
it
from
going
back
and
realigning.
and,
justice
breyer,
the
passenger
service
in
this
country
has
that
type
of
device
in
effect.
they
use
it
and
they
use
it
without
major
problems.
the
freight
industry--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
involved
in
the
case
at
this--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--not
the
record.
it's
in
my
brief.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
point
is
that
this
is
a
performance
standard
statute.
the
congress
was
not
concerned
with
how
the
industry
attempted
to
prevent
employees
from
going
in
between
the
cars.
they
said
to
the
industry,
take
care
of
the
problem
in
coupling
and
uncoupling.
take
care
of
that
problem.
do
not
allow
the
employees
to
go
between
the
cars
in
either
process.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
only
the--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--only
the
process
of
coupling
and
uncoupling.
the
maintenance
testing
and
inspection
of
the
car...
there
is
no
problem
here.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
does
not.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
because
it
will
not
engage
unless
it's
set
properly.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
that
is
not
covered
under
the
statute,
justice
scalia.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
this--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--this
court
has
already
ruled
many
years
ago
in
a
case
called
wagner
there
as
no
movement
of
the
car.
you
don't
have
to
have
movement
of
the
car.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it's
not
only
the
proximity,
but
in
the
preparation
of
the
coupling.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
not
preparation
of
the
coupling,
justice
scalia.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no.
it's
not
in
the
preparation
of
coupling.
no,
sir.
that
could
be
in
a
shop
somewhere.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
certainly
not
in
the
preparation
of
coupling
in
my
judgment.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
disagree.
no,
sir.
not
until
the
cars
are
on
the
tracks--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--some
proximity.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
don't
think
it
matters--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
think
there
was
a
car
length
or
maybe
two,
but
it
doesn't
matter.
the
fact
is
if
the
employee
has
to
go
in
preparation
of
the
coupling
procedure,
it
doesn't
matter
what
time
or
how
long
that
time
is
in
his
work
day.
the
purpose
is
to
prevent
that
employee
from
going
in
between
the
cars
for
coupling
or
uncoupling
so
that
if
that
car
sits
on
the
track,
say,
even
an
hour,
so
long
as
it
is
in
preparation
of
the
coupling
procedure,
i
submit
to
you,
justice
scalia,
it's
covered.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
could
not
happen
in
this
case.
it
could
not
happen
because
this
drawbar
was
skewed,
and
had
the
crews
attempted
to
push
the
cars
together
to
collide
for
coupling,
it
would
have
never
happened.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
doesn't
matter
as
long
as--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--if
it's
in
the
same
track
and
they're
going...
and
the
locomotive
is
ready
to
push
that
car
and
it...
this
was
an
operation.
we
had
locomotive
in
the
track.
they
were
ready
to
push
the
cars
together.
that's
why
the
employees
were
required
to
align
it.
they
were
ready
to
do
it.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
they
were.
they
were
in
the
preparation.
they
couldn't
couple--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
agree.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
i
submit,
justice
scalia,
the
immediate
preparation
of
that
car
so
that
that
could
occur
would
be
encompassed
there.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
justice
o'connor--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--but
the
drawbar
is
all
part
and
parcel...
there's
the
draw
head,
which
is
the
actual
coupling
device,
and
then
it
is
attached
in
one
solid
piece
of
equipment.
it's
not
separate
in
any
way.
it's
one
solid
piece
of
equipment...
this
whole
drawbar...
and
part
of
that
is
the
head
of
the
drawbar.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i...
they
dealt
with
particular
parts
of
the
whole
drawbar,
but
they're
not
different.
it's
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
piece
of
equipment.
it's
not...
you
can't
detach
it.
i
mean,
you
could...
legally
you
could
take
the
whole
part
off,
but
you
don't
take
one
off
and
leave
the
rest
sitting
there.
i--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
that
pin
could
never
have
been
placed
in
the
train
unless
they
were
together.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
agree.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
i
think
it
is
important
to
go
back.
what
was
congress
trying
to
prevent
here?
injuries
and
deaths.
and
how
could
they
do
it?
the
only
way
they--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--correct.
that's
part
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
you
did
not
have
the
same
type
of
technology
at
that
time
as
you
have
today.
congress...
it
is
a
performance
standard,
justice
o'connor,
and
being
a
performance
standard,
congress
didn't
care
how
you
do
it.
congress
said
to
the
industry,
do
it,
protect
the
employee
in
this
procedure.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but,
justice
souter,
judge
mackinnon
stated,
misaligned
drawbar
or
a
closed
coupler
is
sufficient
to
establish
liability
under
section
2.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
technology.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
not
at
that
time,
but
i
think
that
that--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--no.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
think
there
are...
there
may
be
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
technology
was
just
emerging.
congress
didn't
know
nor
did
it
concern
itself
with
how
this
performance
standard
was
to
be
performed.
what
congress
was
concerned
with
is
protecting
the
worker
during
that
procedure,
whatever
that
procedure
is.
and
i
could
envision,
justice
souter,
of
having
a
large
rod
standing
on
the
outside
of
the
car
and
simply
pushing
it,
but
the
industry
hasn't
provided
that.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
i'm
not
saying
the
technology
could
not
be
devised.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
here
it's
attached.
it
doesn't
provide
any
movement.
it's
just
an
open
and
shut
type
of
lever
here.
but
i--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--it
opens
this
part
here
so
that--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--no,
it
doesn't.
it
just
opens.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they
couldn't
devise
it.
it's
not
unlike
the
old
pinto
cases
where
it
took
$10
to
put
a
valve
in.
it's
cost.
it's
just
economics.
it's
all
it
is.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
starting
in
1970.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
i
don't
know
that.
i'm
not--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i...
that's
not
in
the
record
anywhere
that
there
was
no
enforcement.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the...
two
things.
one
is
the
court
has
addressed
injuries
occurring
in
this
type
of
situation,
not
specifically
the
misalignment,
but
in
other--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
only
part
of
one's
body...
if
you
recall,
justice
ginsburg,
the
hook
came
into
play
after
the
coupler
was
opened
part
way.
this
is
not
totally
effective
and
efficient
because
it
doesn't
always
open
it
fully.
so,
in
lewis,
there
was
an
additional
hook
used
and
the
employee
stood
beside
the
car,
of
course
had
to
reach
his
arm
inside,
and
pull
it
out.
that's
that
piece
of
equipment
that
was
used
in
lewis.
and
the
court...
i
mean,
i
can't
take
issue
with
the
decision
of
the
court,
but
the
court
further
said
in
that
case
that
if
there
is
a
misaligned
drawbar,
then
that
is
covered
as
a
violation
under
section
2
of
the
act.
and
that's
just
what
we
have
here.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no.
i
don't
think
there's
liability
because
i
think
you
have
a
super-intervening
cause.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
until
he...
i
think
there's
a
super-intervening
cause.
until...
there's...
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
violation
exists.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
there--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes.
and
i
further
state
that
there
already
was
the
violation,
justice
kennedy.
the
violation
occurred
because
there
was
the
necessity
of
the
employee
to
even
have
to
go
in
between.
the
violation
already
occurred.
now,
whether
or
not
there's
causation
for
recovery
is
a
different
issue,
of
course,
but
as
far
as
the
violation
of
section
2,
it
exists
once
there
is
a
skewed
drawbar.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it's
not
irrelevant.
the
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
that
you
do
not
have
to
establish
a
defect
in
a
car
to
prove
violation
of
section
2.
affolder
was
one,
a
o'donnell
case,
carter
case.
there
are
several
cases,
and
the
court
said
that
over
and
over.
and
that's
the
gist
of
the
railroad's
argument
here,
that
you
must
show
a
defect
before
you
can
recover.
but
if...
if...
the
performance
requirement
is
not
there,
this
statute
says
that's
a
violation
because
it's
up
to
the
carrier
to
protect
the
employee.
otherwise,
you're
going
to
continue
to
have
employee
injuries
and
deaths.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
saying
that
the
performance
requirement
is
that
in
every
case,
not
just
in...
when
there's
moving
equipment,
not
just
when
there's
a
defect,
in
every
case
where
the
couplers
do
not
couple
automatically
and
cannot
couple
automatically
because
of
the
way
the
equipment
is
designed,
that
there's
a
violation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
and
the
court
has
already
ruled
on
that,
that
you
do
not
have
to
show
a
failure.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
this
is
a
failure
of
the
coupler.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
because
it
can't
couple
automatically.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
that's
the
whole
point
of
our
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
statute
doesn't
mean
that
it
must
be
aligned,
of
course,
then
we
lose,
but
any--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--the
court
has
held
in
several
cases
that's
not
the
fact.
that
is
totally
immaterial
to
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
think
o'donnell
case
is
clearly
on
point.
so
is
carter.
o'donnell,
they
said
it
doesn't
matter
that
you
expect
too
much
of
the
coupler.
specifically
the
court
stated
that.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
think
those
three
cases
would
hold
that.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
o'donnell
would
so
state
that.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
in
pushing,
he...
what
he
attempted
to
do--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--justice
breyer,
is
push
it
back
in
line.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that
was
certainly
part
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
it's
not...
anything
is
not
covered.
this
is
the
only
thing
that
congress
was
concerned
about,
this
procedure.
it's
so
dangerous,
and--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
either.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
you--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes,
but
not
everything
is
of
course
a
problem
as--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
submit
it
was
broader
than
that.
they
wanted--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--not
bad
backs
per
se.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no,
because
congress
envisioned
that
it
wouldn't
be
necessary.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
federal
railroad
administration
in
the
accident/incident
bulletins,
justice
breyer,
is...
has
a
breakdown
of
those
that
were
injured
in
moving
equipment,
those
that
were
injured
in
non-moving
equipment,
those
that
were
killed
in
both--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
can't...
i
don't
know.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
don't
know.
but
they
do
keep
statistical
data
and
whether
it's
broken
down
that
specific,
i
can't
answer.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
i...
if
you
determined
that
this
is
not
a
design
issue,
then
of
course
we
would
lose,
but
in
all
due
respect--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
if
a
design
is
required,
justice
breyer,
why
does
it
matter
how
many?
if
they
require--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--certainly
congress
in
1893
didn't
know
what
the
problem
was
going
to
be
in
1996,
but
they
did
know
enough
about
that
procedure
to
say
make
it
safe
for
the
employee.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
he
would
not
have
had
a
violation
of
section
2.
there
may
be
some
other
violation
but
not
of
section
2.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
in--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--and
it
further,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
states
that
the
railroad
cannot
avoid
liability
depending
upon
how
difficult
it
will
be
for
them
to
make
a
coupler
that
works
in
all
situations.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
the
dicta
does,
not
the
specific
holding
in
the
case,
but
the
dicta
certainly
does
because
it
states
that
you
should
not
be...
the
railroad
cannot
escape
liability
by
showing
too
much
was
demanded
of
it
at
338
u.s.
393-394.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
if
you're
drawing
the
distinction,
i
can't
argue
that
point
because
i
don't
think
there's
a
distinction.
they're
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
piece
of
equipment.
i
don't
know
how
you
can--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--the
entire
thing
is
misaligned.
the
entire
piece
of
equipment
is
misaligned.
you
can't...
one
part...
it's
impossible
to
separate
the
two
because
here
is
the
draw
head
and
here
is
the
device
it
is
attached
to,
the
whole
drawbar,
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
distinguish--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--very
logical
of
the
court
because
they
had
developed
this
technology
to
allow
it
to
open
and
close
without
the
necessity
of
the
employee
going
between,
but
they
haven't
addressed
the
other
part
of
that
statute,
and
that
is
the
coupling
part.
the
uncoupling
part
they
did
address.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
court
has
held--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--the
court
has
held
that
it's
absolute
liability.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
super-intervening
cause.
it's
not
caused
by
the--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
you're
talking
about
recovery
for
damages--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--liability--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--sure,
but--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--the
violation
has
already
occurred.
the
violation
is
that
this
is
not
aligned
properly.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
it's
similar
because
it
is...
the
violation
already
exists.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
recovery
is
a
different
aspect
of
liability.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
that
snake
bite.
we
have
the
immediate
issue
of
pushing
the
drawbar
which
they
have
not
used
their
technology
to
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
don't
think
there's
a--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
don't
think
that's
a
violation
of
the
statute
if
he's
inside
the
car.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
if
he's
between
the
car,
it's
certainly
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
not
anything.
only
in
the
coupling
and
uncoupling
procedure
and
in
the
preparation
of
that.
that's
the
only
thing
that's
covered
by
the
statute.
you
have
maintenance
testing
and
inspection.
none
of
that
is
covered.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
there's
the
lewis
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
d.c.
circuit.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
and
it
doesn't
specifically
say
that,
but
when
you
look
at
wagner
case,
for
example,
there
was
no
movement
involved.
that
was
a
person
who
was
preparing...
let
me
explain,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
agree,
justice
o'connor,
but
in
the
preparation
for
it...
i
think
it's
certainly
reasonable
to
include
preparation
if
there's
a
necessity
of
someone
going
between
the
cars.
and
i'll
refer
you
back
to
the
old
wagner
case
of
the
court.
that
case,
the
employee
was
literally
standing
on
this
coupler--
