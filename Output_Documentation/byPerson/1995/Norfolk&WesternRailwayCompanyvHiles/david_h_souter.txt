justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
have
done
it
in
1893?
in
other
words,
we've
heard
talk
about
what
the
technology
may
or
may
not
allow
today.
what
do
we
know
about
the
technology
in
1893?
i
gathered
from
judge
mackinnon's
opinion
that
he
was
assuming
the
technology
didn't
exist
in
1893
so
that
in
fact
one...
on
your
theory
of
the
statute,
the
railroad
could
not
have
conformed
in
these
situations.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
talking
about
what
he
was
saying
about
the
technology.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
the
technology
exist
in
1893
to...
in
effect,
to
conform
to
the
standard
of
the
statute
as
you
read
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
would
congress
have
passed
a
statute
which
assumed
a
technology
that
didn't
exist?
if
that's
what
it
wanted
to
do,
why
wouldn't...
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
a
lot
simpler
for
congress
to
say,
look,
the
railroads
are
absolutely
liable
without
fault
whenever
anybody
gets
hurt
between
two
cars?
if
that's
what
they
wanted
to
accomplish--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
didn't
they
say
that
instead
of
writing
a
statute
which
is
couched
in
terms
of
what
is
mechanically
possible
and
at
a
time
when
it
was
not
mechanically
possible
to
guarantee
the
kind
of
degree
of
safety
that
you
claim
is
inherent
in
the
standard
of
obligation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
it's
a
simple
question
and
it
goes
to
what
i'm
seeing
in
that
picture.
why
doesn't
the...
why
isn't
it
possible
for
that
lever,
which
the
picture
shows,
to
align
the
drawbar
prior
to
coupling?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
just
looks
as
though
that's
what
it
could
do
and
maybe
it
isn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
it
open
and
shut?
the
knuckle?
it
pushes
the
pin
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
oh,
i
see.
it
doesn't
move
the
bar
back
and
forth.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
