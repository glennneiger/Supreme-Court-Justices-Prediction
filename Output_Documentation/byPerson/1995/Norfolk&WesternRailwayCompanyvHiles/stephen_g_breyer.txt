justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
technical
question?
there
isn't
a
drawing
anywhere
of
what
these
things
look
like
i
guess
in
the
record,
is
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
have
been
helpful
because
i'm
trying
to
figure
it
out
and
i
might
have
gotten
this
wrong.
i
guess
what
it
is
is
a
car
like
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
there's
a
thing
that
juts
out
from
the
car.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
has
a
knuckle
on
the
end.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
thing
that
juts
out
is
a
drawbar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
sometimes
you
have
to
have
a
little
give
because
it
moves
back
and
forth
when
they
go
around
curves.
and
sometimes
when
it
gets
over
here,
it
gets
stuck
over
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
person
has
to
go
between
the
car
and
move
it
back
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
didn't
somebody
think
of
just
putting
a
spring
on
it
so
the
spring
makes
it
come
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually
my
law
clerk
found
one
in
the
car
locomotive
cyclopedia
for
1974.
they
have
four
pictures,
and
it
says,
this
is
a
device.
it
keeps
a
free
coupler
centered
in
relation
to
the
end.
if
the
coupler
is
swung
wide
when
disengaged
from
another,
the
device
instantly
returns
it
to
center
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
they
have
four
pictures
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
also
found
a
place
where...
he
was
quite
ingenious
to
find
all
this
stuff,
but
he
found
a
place
where
they're
doing
research
right
now.
it
says
4
percent
of
the
employee's
lost
time
is
associated
with
uncoupling
locomotives,
and
we're
going
to
do
a
research
project.
they're...
but
my
point
is
that
this
material
i'm
reading
to
you
makes
it
sound
as
if
the
problem
is
a
design
problem.
it
isn't
just
a
maintenance
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it's
a
design
problem
and
not
just
a
maintenance
problem...
i'm
sure
congress
didn't
want
to
stop
people
from
going
in
between
cars
to
maintain
oil--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--rust-free
paint,
but
they
did
have
in
mind
designing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
why
not?
if
4
percent
of
people's
lost
time
is
lost
because
of
the...
i'm
not
saying
that
i...
how
i
view
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
simply
trying
to
figure
out,
is
it
more
like
maintaining,
you
oil
the
thing,
or
is
it
more
like
designing
a
better
coupler?
so,
i
look
at
this
stuff
and
say,
well,
4
percent
lost
time,
the
association
of
railroads
says
we're
going
to
do
research.
this
is
a...
they
have
four
drawings
of
springs.
it
sounds
like
design
and
if
it's
design,
isn't
that
the
kind
of
problem
congress
had
in
mind?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
they
had...
the
old
system
was
a
system
where
you
had
a
thing
sticking
out
of
the
car
called
a
drawbar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
had
a
link
at
the
end.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
link
went
inside
another
drawbar,
i
take
it,
called
a
pocket,
and
then
you
dropped
a
pin
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
you'd
think
the
coupling
system
was
that
whole
thing,
wouldn't
you?
the
thing
that
sticks
out,
the
link,
the
pin,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
injuries
were
there
last
year,
if
you
know,
approximately
caused
when
people
went
between
cars
to
realign
misaligned
drawbars?
do
we
know
the
answer
to
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
that...
i
know
that...
i
do
recall
i
had
some
numbers
on
that,
but
i
didn't
know
that
that
was
related
to
going
between
cars
to
cure
the
problem
of
misaligned
drawbars.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
the
statute
in
any
case
requires
the
necessity
of
going
between
the
ends
of
the
vehicles.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
that
i
find
it
quite
relevant...
and
i'm
uncertain
about
how
to
proceed...
is
if
in
fact
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
are
hurt
by
this
and
they
have
to
go
between
the
cars
to
realign
the
drawbars
and
you
could
cure
it
at
very
little
expense
with
a
rubber
band
or
a
spring,
perhaps
it
does
fall
within
the
statute
which
was
worried
about
going
between
the
bars
and
being
hurt
for
coupling.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
just
like
maintenance
where
you
oil
it
occasionally,
then
it
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
obvious
reason--
--but
in--
--sorry.
one
more
quick.
in
this
case,
as
i
understood
it,
your
position
is
that
the...
whether
or
not
the
drawbar
was
stuck
was
irrelevant,
but
it
seems
to
me
that...
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
what
was...
reference
justice
kennedy's
question,
in
this
case
wasn't
the
injury
he
hurt
his
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
that
the
kind
of
injury
that
congress
was
worried
about
in
passing
the
statute?
i
would
have
thought
that
people
being
crushed
or
something
or
having
their
fingers
stuck
in
the
pins.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
it...
i
mean,
you
can
hurt
your
back
pushing
anything
in
a
railroad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
of
bad
backs
because
of
pushing
it,
or
because
that
you
might
get
crushed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
either?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
aren't
there
a
lot
of
heavy
things
that
you
push
in
the
railroad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
indication
that
what
congress
was
worried
about
was
the
fact
that
it
was
heavy
and
you
might
hurt
your
back
pushing
it,
any
part
of
this
device?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
any
part
of
the
previous
device?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
anything
that
suggests
it
was
at
least
as
broad
as
to
catch
that?
i
mean,
is
there
anything
about
bad
backs
and
pushing
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
pushing.
pushing.
you
hurt
your
muscle
because
you
pushed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
actually
thinking
too
is
one
reason
why
this
might
not
have
come
up
before
before
the
railroad
commissions
is
no
one
has
ever
been
hurt
by
this
in
a
way
in
which
congress
was
worried
about.
that
is,
their
footnote
says
one
person
is
killed
and
136
injured
in
all
coupling
and
decoupling
accidents,
of
which
pushing
drawbars
or
having
anything
to
do
with
misaligned
drawbars
must
be
a
subset.
and
so
is
there
any
information
that
anyone
has
been
hurt
in
the
manner
that
congress
foresaw
by
crushing
or
hands
or
something
to
do
with
it
being
a
car
other
than
just
being
a
heavy
weight
to
push?
ever?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
the
answer
then
as
to
how
many
people
were
injured
or
killed
in
dealing
with
misaligned
drawbars?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
couldn't
find
it.
we
looked
for
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
then
is
the...
if
i
thought
that
really
what
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
here
is
between
what
i'd
call
routine
maintenance
of
things
that
occasionally
cause
trouble
and
serious
design
problems...
and
a
serious
design
problem
has
to
do
with
numbers
and
the
kinds
of
injuries
congress
thought
about...
then
wouldn't
i
have
to
decide
this
against
you
because
the
record
isn't...
doesn't
have
that
information
and
i
can't
get
it
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
would
i
decide
in
your
favor
on
some
presumption?
i
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
how
can
we
decide
if
it's
a
design
issue
if
we
don't
have
numbers
that
tell
us
how
many
people
are
hurt
or
killed
compared
with,
let's
say,
the
difficulty
of
doing
the
redesign?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
in
fact
you
wouldn't
have
to
spend
the
entire
gross
national
product
to
save
somebody
from
having
a
bad
finger
because
design
is
always
a
question
of
what
kind
of
problem
is
caused
to
people
and
how
difficult
is
it
to
solve
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
safe
is
itself
a
word
that
implies
that
failure
to
do
it
hurts
somebody
and
it's
possible
to
redesign
your
way
out
of
it.
so,
in
that--
--mr.
mann,
the
safe
that
they're
concerned
about
is
not
back
safety.
i
don't
see
how
you
win
if
it's
a
design
defect
either.
for
all
we
know,
the
ultimate
design
that
comes
to
solve
the
problem
you're
concerned
with
is
a
design
that
enables
this
arm
to
be
adjusted
from
inside
the
railroad
car
with
just
as
much
physical
effort
as
it
takes
to
do
it
from
outside
or
from
the
side
of
the
car
so
that
he
doesn't
have
to
go
between
the
car,
but
he
still
has
to
push
just
as
hard.
he
would
have
hurt
his
back
just
the
same
way.
