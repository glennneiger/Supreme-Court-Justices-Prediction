mr.
phillips,
was
the
drawbar
technology
essentially
the
same
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
as
it
is
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
at
the
time
that
the
statute
we're
reviewing
was
adopted,
it
was
necessary
for
the
drawbar
to
be
physically
adjusted
at
times
between
the
cars.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
we
know
that
the
drawbar
is
not
part
of
the
coupling
device?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mann,
i
have
trouble
knowing
why
we
should
interpret
the
statute...
the
word
coupler...
as
including
the
drawbar.
i'm
not
sure
it
does.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
may
well
be
different
things.
they
are
dealt
with
differently
in
the
statute.
and
one
could
envision
a
coupler
as
not
including
the
drawbar
as
such.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
appears
from
the
language
used
in
the
different
sections
of
the
statute
that
congress
saw
these
as
different
things.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
seems
like
what
they
were
after
was
a
system
to
replace
the
old
method
where
somebody
had
to
go
between
the
cars
to
put
the
pin
in
to
couple
the
cars.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
it
was
this
joinder
business
where
they
come
together
and
the
old
pin
used
to
have
to
go
that
they
were
talking
about--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--not
the
drawbar
that
swings
back
and
forth
of
necessity
to
allow
the
train
to
turn.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it's
sort
of
the...
you
know,
the
head
bone
is
connected
to
the
neck
bone
is
connected
to
the
backbone,
et
cetera.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
at
some
point
they're
all
one.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
case
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
most
common
thing
was
this
business
of
having
to
put
in
the
pins.
that's
what
they
were
focusing
on.
they
didn't
want
people
to
have
to
go
in
there
and
physically
drop
in
the
pins.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i...
it
is
not
apparent
to
me
that
they
were
concerned
about
the
necessity
of
occasionally
moving
the
drawbar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
affolder,
there
was
also
dicta
in
which
the
court
said,
of
course,
the
result
assumes
the
coupler
was
placed
in
a
position
to
operate
on
impact.
the
railroad
would
have
a
good
defense
that
the
coupler
had
not
been
properly
opened.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
in
preparation
for
coupling.
it
doesn't
say
that.
i
think
you're
grafting
something
on
that
isn't
in
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
we
have
some
concern,
when
we're
talking
about
imposition
of
a
rule
of
per
se
liability,
to
make
sure
that
that's
what
the
statute
was
intended
to
cover?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
see
why
we
should
make
a
stretch
to
pick
up
every
conceivable
kind
of
a
result
here.
