mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
2
of
the
safety
appliance
act,
which
is
quoted
on
page
2
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
and
which
states
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
a
railroad
to
use
on
its
line...
excuse
me...
any
car
not
equipped
with
couplers
coupling
automatically
by
impact,
and
which
can
be
uncoupled
without
the
necessity
of
men
going
between
the
ends
of
the
cars.
in
this
case
the
respondent,
a
switchman
at
the
rail
yard
in
st.
louis,
missouri,
injured
his
back
while
attempting
to
pull
a
drawbar
into
alignment
that
had
become
misaligned
almost
certainly
as
a
consequence
of
having
been
disconnected
from
a
prior
car
on
a
curve.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
o'connor.
i
don't
think
there's
much
in
the
way
of
a
significant
advance
since
1893.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that's
correct.
as
the
d.c.
circuit
said
in
the
lewis
case,
that
if
you
accept
the
notion
that
any
misaligned
drawbar
violates
the
safety
appliance
act,
then
every
railroad
has
been
in
noncompliance
with
that
act
since
1898
when
it
went
into
effect,
which
means
that
every
railroad
has
been
subject
since
1898
to
$100
fines
for
every
such
violation,
which
might
have
actually
saved
the
federal
government
its
budget
problems
today,
but
clearly
would
have
done
so
on
the
back
of
the
railroads
in
ways
i
don't
think
congress
intended.
what
we
have
here
is
an
injury
that
falls
far
afield
from
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1893
when
it
acted
to
protect
railroad
workers
from
the
possibility
of
being
crushed
between
railroad
cars
as
a
consequence
of
the
old-fashioned
link
and
coupling
devices
used.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there's
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
that
would
have
been
available
to
him
had
he
chosen
to
bring
that
action.
that,
of
course--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
would
assume
at
this
stage
it's
too
late,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
have
run.
it
seems
to
me
it
was
a
conscious
choice
by
the
employee
in
this
case
to
bring
this
action
exclusively
under
the
safety
appliance
act
and
to
do
so
to
obtain
the
benefits
under
state
law,
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--he
would
have
to
show
some
negligence
under
fela,
and
respondent
has
steadfastly
avoided
any
effort
to
attempt
to
do
that
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
to
my
knowledge,
no,
your
honor.
the
required
negligence...
it's
the
only
scheme
that
stands
out
in
this
particular
way.
on
the
other
hand,
of
course,
unlike
most
workers'
compensation
schemes,
where
there
is
a
fairly
fixed
cap
on
the
recovery,
there's
no
similar
cap
on
the
recovery
under
fela.
as
a
consequence
of
that,
employees
tend
to
get
significant
recoveries.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
seamen
have
the
same...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
guess
i
would
have
two
responses
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
that
suggests
that
there
might
be
some
potential
claim
as
a
matter
of
negligence
or
even
a
claim
under
the
safety
appliance
act
where
the
only
evidence
is
a
malfunction
and
no
evidence
put
forward
by
the
railroad
as
to
why
the
malfunction
occurred,
that
is,
to
show
that...
simply
a
case
of
a
misaligned
drawbar
or
an
unopened
knuckle...
sure,
there
could
be
recovery
under
those
circumstances,
although
i
wouldn't
expect
that
to
happen
very
often.
the
alternative,
though,
is
it's
difficult
to
square
the
broader
understanding
of
that
language
with
the
statutory
scheme
because
it's
reasonably
clear
to
me
that
in
order
to
recover
under...
through
fela
for
a
safety
appliance
act
violation,
it
has
to
be
a
safety
appliance
act
violation.
you
cannot
stretch
the
safety
appliance
act
to
cover
situations
that
it
wasn't
designed
to
cover
simply
because
you
end
up
ultimately
obtaining
your
recompense
through
fela
as
a
technical
matter.
it
seems
to
me
you'd
have
to
conclude
that
a
misaligned
drawbar
is
a
violation
of
section
2.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
you
can
justify
that
statement
in
the
very
limited
sense
in
which
this
court
has
in
the
past
recognized
that
if
all
the
proof
you
have
is
a
malfunction
and
nothing
else
comes
in,
there
could
be
liability
under
those
circumstances.
to
the
extent
that
that's
what
his
statement
means,
i
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
it.
to
the
extent
he
goes
beyond
that,
you're
right,
justice
ginsburg.
i
was
being
polite
in
suggesting
i
didn't
agree
with
him.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
why
would
there
be
liability
in
that
situation?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
this
court's
decisions
suggest
that
there
are
essentially
two
ways
to
demonstrate
a
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act:
either
there
has
been
a
malfunction
of
the
coupler
or
there
has
been
a
defect
in
the
coupler.
in
the
malfunctioning
situation,
what
the
court
says
is,
we
will
presume,
if
it
malfunctioned,
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
an
equipment
failure.
but
what
the
court
said
quite
plainly
in
affolder
was
that
that
presumes
in
the
first
instance
that
the
couplers
were
set
to
operate
normally,
and
if
the
couplers
were
not
set,
in
that
case
by
the
way,
opening
of
the
knuckle...
in
our
case
i
submit
by
way
of
aligning
the
drawbar
so
that
the
knuckles
would
in
fact
connect...
then
it
seems
to
me,
as
the
court
said
in
affolder,
we
would
have
a
good
defense
under
that
circumstance.
so,
really
the
way
the
particular
problem
arises
simply
is
a
technical
kind
of
pleading
problem.
if
there
had
been
in
this
case
a
failed
coupling,
i
think
it
might
have
been
the
case
that
we
would
have
been
required
to
come
forward
to
show
that
it
was
merely
still
a
misaligned
drawbar
problem,
but
in
this
case
there
was
no
malfunction.
there
was
no
effort
in
coupling
these
particular
cars
and,
therefore,
we
were
never
even
put
to
the
necessity
of
making
that
particular
proof,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
no
malfunction
and
we
have
no
defect.
and
when
you
don't
have
either
of
those
things,
i
would
have
said
that
the
safety
appliance
act
issue
comes
to
a
close.
respondents,
however,
because
they
can't
satisfy
the
traditional
standards
that
this
court
has
adopted
has
posed
two
much
broader
tests
to
be
applied.
one
is,
is
that
anytime
you
have
a
coupling
problem
which
requires
an
employee
to
go
between
the
ends
of
two
cars,
tracking
the
end
language
of
section
2
of
the
safety
appliance
act,
that
then
any
injuries
that
arise
under
those
circumstances
ought
to
be
compensable
under
section
2
through
fela.
and
our
answer
to
that
is
that
that
simply
defies
the
language
of
that
statute.
that...
this
is
not
a
statute
that
imposes
operational
restrictions
on
how
railroads
go
about
their
business.
what
the
language
about
going
between
two
cars
does
is
fairly
describe
the
type
of
coupler
that
congress
meant
to
require
in
1893.
and
a
little
bit
of
history
here
goes
a
long
way
to
giving
content
to
that
particular
phrase.
what
we
knew
at
the
time
was
that
in
1893
automatic
couplers
were
fairly
new
to
the
scene,
and
congress
did
not
want
to
mandate
any
particular
type
of
coupling
and
uncoupling
mechanism.
it
simply
wanted
to
describe
the
type
of
a
device
that
it
wanted
implemented
by
1898,
and
therefore
what
the...
as
the
court
again
in
the
d.c.
circuit
said
in
the
lewis
case,
what
we
know
is
that
that
independent
requirement
about
going
between
cars
is
not
itself
an
independent
prohibition
under
the
act.
part
of
the
reason
we
know
that
it
can't
be
really
a
significant
independent
requirement
under
the
act
is
it
doesn't
even
modify,
by
its
own
terms,
the
fact
of
coupling.
now,
this
court
has
applied
that
language
to
the
coupling
as
a
reasonable,
i
think,
interpretation
of
probably
congress'
intent,
but
it
seems
quite
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
meant
to
make
going
between
cars
the
ultimate
sort
of
sine
qua
non
of
a
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
and
not
had
that
language
actually
modify,
by
its
own
terms,
that
coupling
process.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
the
record--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
drawbar.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
although--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--when
he
does
that,
obviously,
he
doesn't
have
to
be
right
between
the
cars.
the
cars
can
be
quite
far
apart.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
assume...
i
mean,
there
have
been
experiments
made
over
the
past
80,
90
years
trying
to
come
up
with
a
mechanism
to
make
it
spring
back,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
assume
that
would
be
one
of
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that
goes
to
the
second
broad
theory
that
the
respondents
put
forward,
which
is
that
you
really
have
a
duty
to
come
up
with
some
system
to
realign
these
drawbars.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
statute
says--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
think
it's
the
kind
of
problem
congress
had
in
mind
because
we
know
that
congress
dealt
specifically
with
drawbars
in
the
safety
appliance
act
itself
and
in
section
5
said,
set
up
a
drawbar
at
a
certain
height.
so,
congress
knows
the
difference
between
coupling
mechanisms
and
the
drawbar,
and
congress
dealt
with
the
drawbar.
now,
with
respect
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
we
can...
we
know
that
congress
at
least
viewed
them
differently
because
section
2
talks
about
coupling
couplers
and
section
5
talks
about
drawbars.
so,
congress
at
least
had
in
mind
the
possibility
of
the
two
being
distinct,
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
that
seems
to
me
a
reasonable
basis
for
answering
justice
breyer's
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not
trying
to
draw
too
fine
a
distinction
here.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
congress
clearly
had
the
two
different
things
in
mind.
this
is
an
automatic
coupling
requirement,
not
an
automatic
realignment
of
the
drawbar
requirement.
and
the
fact
that
congress
discussed
specifically
drawbars
simply
creates
an
inference
to
me
that
congress
didn't
go
as
far
as
what
the
respondents
have
proposed
as
far
as
the
obligations
under
the
safety
appliance
act.
i
think
the
more
fundamental--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
my...
well,
my...
it
seems
to
me
the
respondent
has
made
two
arguments.
one
is
based
on
that
language,
and
i
don't
think
that
language
carries
with
it
an
independent
substantive
requirement.
now,
the
respondents
do
make
the
alternative
argument
that
under
any
circumstances
we
should
have
some
kind
of
a
duty
to
guarantee
that
drawbars
can
be
realigned
regardless
of
what
it
takes,
that
we
have
a
technological
responsibility
that
goes
forward.
and
all
i
was
trying
to
say
to
justice
breyer
is
i
don't
think
that's
what
this
statute
ever
had
in
mind.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
would
support
it,
and
indeed,
the
absence
of
an
independent
requirement
of
having
to
go
between
the
cars
is
the
complete--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
may
have
parsed
their
argument
too
finely
for
that
purpose,
but
i
do
think
the
point
remains
the
same
which
is
there
is
no
duty
on
the
railroads
to
devise
the
kind
of
technological
change
that
justice
breyer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
answer
to
that
was...
is
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief.
as
i
recall,
it
depends
on
which
years
you
pick.
one
year
there
was
one
death
and
a
handful
of
injuries.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
anybody
collects
the
data
on
that
close
a
point.
i
think
what
they
do
is
they
collect
data
on
coupling
problems,
and
then
whatever
coupling
problems
may...
presumably
you
could
have
an
injury
if
somebody
is
going
in
to
lubricate
the
coupler
so
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
within--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct,
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
right.
if
he
had--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely.
if
he
had
been
asked
to
bring
a
coupler
in
and
put
it
on
the
end
of
the
drawbar
and
picked
up
the
coupler
and
injured
his
back,
he
would
have
exactly
the
same
injury
and
exactly
the
same
situation,
but
there
wouldn't
be
a
serious
argument
that
that
violated
the
safety
appliance
act.
again,
that's
a
situation
where
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
would
apply.
i
do
want
to
answer
justice
breyer's
one
concern
about
this
technology
and
whether
it
exists.
the
most
recent
evidence
i
saw
from
the
aar
was
that
on
the
devices
that
have
these
kinds
of
springs,
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
30-some
percent
were
the
only...
were
in
operation...
were
actually
working,
even
on...
where
they
have
those
devices.
for
some
reason...
and
i
don't
frankly
know
the
technical
explanation
for
it,
but
for
some
reason
these
springs
don't
hold
up
very
well
and
in
that
sense
probably
pose
at
least
as
much
of
a
risk
of
having
people
go
in
there--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--this
is
in
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion
in
the
lewis
case.
there's
a
discussion
of
this
evidence.
that's
all.
i
just
mentioned
it
for
that
purpose.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
would
go
back--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
would
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
point
because
i
think
you
cannot
get
to
that
stage
unless
you
conclude
that
there
is
an
independent
prohibition
against
going
between
cars.
and
that
i
don't
think
the
purpose
or
the
language
of
this
statute
will
sustain.
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
problem
that
requires
a
resolution,
whenever
they
get
back
in
order
again,
it
should
be
dealt
with
across
the
street
and
not
by
the
court
here.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
what
we
have
here
is
an
injury
that
is
nowhere
near
the
kinds
of
injuries
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
safety
appliance
act
in
1893.
this
is
an
injury
that
is
fully
compensable
if
there
has
been
negligence
by
the
railroad
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
in
addition
to
that,
of
course,
the
railroad
would
have
the
opportunity
under
those
circumstances
to
demonstrate
contributory
negligence
and
thereby
reduce
the
employee's
recovery
as
a
consequence
of
that
contributory
negligence.
i
think
that
is
a
balanced
scheme
and
that
this
court
ought
not
to
unbalance
that
scheme
by
giving
the
safety
appliance
act
an
unduly
broad
interpretation.
for
that
reason--

--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
i
understand
it,
there
has
not
been
any
significant
technological
advance
that
would
eliminate
what
problems
existed
in
the
past.
that's
my
understanding.
again,
none
of
this
happens
to
be
in
the
record,
though.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
questions,
i'm
inclined
to
give
you
back
my
time.
