the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
a
bit
more
obvious,
it
is
a
norfolk
and
western
railway
co.
versus
hiles,
no.
95-6.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
illinois
appellate
court
for
the
fifth
judicial
district.
railroad
cars
are
connected
by
couplers
located
in
both
ends
of
each
car.
the
couplers
attached
to
a
housing
mechanism
on
the
car
by
drawbar
that
is
designed
to
have
some
lateral
plate
to
prevent
moving
cars
from
the
derailing
on
a
curved
track.
as
a
result
of
this
lateral
movement,
drawbars
may
remain
off-center
when
cars
are
uncoupled
and
must
be
realigned
manually
to
ensure
proper
coupling.
respondent
william
hiles
injured
his
back
while
attempting
to
realign
an
off-center
drawbar
and
sued
petitioner
norfolk
and
western
railroad
company
in
illinois
state
court
arguing
that
the
misaligned
drawbar
was
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
this
law
prohibits
railroads
from
using
cars
that
are
not
equipped
with
couplers
that
will
automatically
couple
on
impact
and
uncoupled
without
the
necessity
of
employees
going
between
the
cars.
the
trial
court
ruled
in
favor
of
hiles
and
the
appellate
court
affirmed.
we
now
reverse.
hiles
argues
that
the
statute
was
violated
because
the
car
would
not
couple
until
he
realigned
the
drawbar
and
he
could
not
do
that
without
going
between
the
cars.
we
disagree
primarily
because
the
language
of
section
2
requires
only
that
railroads
equip
their
cars
with
standardized
automatic
couplers.
section
2
does
not
independently
prevent
railroad
employees
from
going
between
railcars.
we
have
previously
recognized
that
employees
must
take
certain
preliminary
steps
to
ensure
proper
performance
of
automatic
couplers
before
a
court
can
find
a
violation
of
section
2
and
today
we
hold
that
realigning
a
misaligned
drawbar
is
one
of
those
preliminary
steps.
we
decline
to
adapt
an
interpretation
of
section
2
that
suggest
a
misaligned
drawbar
is
by
definition
a
malfunctioning
drawbar
nor
can
we
accept
hiles
suggestion
that
section
2
required
the
railroads
to
develop
new
technology
for
automatic
realignment.
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
is
reversed.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
