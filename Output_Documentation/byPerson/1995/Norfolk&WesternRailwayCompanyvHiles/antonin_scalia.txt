justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
excuse
me.
i
thought
your
fundamental
response
is
simply
even
if
that
were
so,
this
is
not
what
congress
meant
by
the
necessity
of
men
going
between
the
ends
of
cars.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
talking
about
going
between
the
ends
of
cars
to
effect
the
immediate
coupling
or
uncoupling.
justice
antonin
scalia
argument.
it
becomes
part
of
that
same
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
someone
might
be
injured
going
between
the
ends
of
vehicles
when
it
was
not
necessary
if
the
vehicles
closed
while
the
person
is
in
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
point
is,
i
take
it,
that
there's
no
necessity
of
going
between
the
ends
of
vehicles
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
this
coupling
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
individual
wasn't
hurt
by
reason
of
being
between
the
two
cars
at
all.
he
strained
his
back
as
i
gather,
trying
to
straighten
it
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
have
happened
if
the
car
had
been
up
on
a
mount.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mann,
i
assume
when
that
coupling
device
is
initially
manufactured,
somebody
had
to
be
there
to
put
it
on.
right?
and
the
car
that
that
car
would
first
be
coupled
to
was
somewhere
down
may
be
miles
away,
but
it
was
somewhere
down
the
railroad
tracks.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
one
could
say
that
the
person
who
installed
that
coupler
was
going
between
the
two
cars,
namely,
between
the
car
he
manufactured
and
the
car
it
would
ultimately
be
coupled
to.
now,
do
you
think
that's
what
the
statute
refers
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
was
going
between
the
cars.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so,
we
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere.
right?
it
has
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right.
now,
is
the
process
of
coupling
or...
you
say
the
process
does
not
begin
with
the
installation
of
the
coupler.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
it
begin
with
the
setting
of
the
coupling
mechanism
so
that
they
will
engage
properly?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
will
not
engage
if
it's
not
installed
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
but
i
don't
see
why
setting
the
arm
is
covered
either.
it
seems
to
me
what
the
statute
addresses
is
the
immediate
action
of
coupling
and
uncoupling
which
is
physically
risky
because
in
the
old
days
the
employees
faced
the
necessity,
which
is
what
the
statute
refers
to...
the
necessity
of
going
between
the
cars
while
they
were
close
together
and
in
the
process
of
coupling.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
necessary
now
in
order
to
set
the
arms.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
movement.
i'm
talking
about
whether
the
act
in
question
is
an
act
that
is
involved
where
the
cars
are
necessarily
in
proximity
because
they
are
in
the
act
of
coupling
or
uncoupling.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
you
say
that
installing
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
putting
it
in
in
the
first
place
is
preparation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
see.
i
see.
so,
installing
it
wouldn't
have
been--
justice
antonin
scalia
--wouldn't
have
been
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
as
soon
as
he
installs
it,
he
moves
the
arm
to
the
proper
central
position.
then
he
is
covered.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--within
some
proximity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
okay.
so,
we're
talking
about
how
much
proximity?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much
proximity
was
there
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
language,
it
seems
to
me,
at
issue
here
in
the
revised
statute
is
couplers
coupling
automatically
by
impact
without
the
necessity
of
individuals
going
between
the
ends
of
vehicles.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
distance
that
you...
you
say
two
car
lengths
is
not
enough.
what
about
10
car
lengths?
justice
antonin
scalia
half
a
mile?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
don't
have
to
be
in
the
process...
the
immediate
process
of
coupling.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
yes,
manufacturing
is
preparation
in
a
sense
too.
you
have
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems
to
me
under
this
statute
the
reasonable
line
to
draw
it
is
when
the
cars
about
to
be
humped
together
in
order
to
effect
the
coupling
or
are
being
pulled
apart
in
order
to
disengage
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
take
a
century
for
somebody
to
get
on
the
pinto.
you're
saying
that
this
thing
was
in
violation
of
the
law
for
a
century.
was
there
any
federal
agency
charged
with
enforcing
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
1970,
there
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
happy
memory.
[laughter]
for
a
century
it
had
the
authority
to
enforce
this
thing
and
did
nothing
about
it
you're
telling
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
the
contrary
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
that's
exactly
what
i'm
pointing
out.
this
thing
has
been
going
on
for
a
century
and
we
have
no
indication
not
only
of
anybody
recovering
previously
because
of
this
safety
defect,
but
of
any
federal
agency
trying
to
enforce
the
safety
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mann,
i
want
to
get
back
to
palsgraf.
you
seem
to
assume
that
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
act,
anything
that
occurs
as...
with
but
for
causality
by
reason
of
that
violation
is
recoverable.
now,
is
that
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
simply
because
the
act
has
been
violated
even
though
the
injury
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
act's
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
pushed
the
bar.
that's
the
supervening
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
might
have
had
the
push
it
from
inside
the
car
even
if
there
had
been
no
safety
violation.
they
might
have
devised
a
new
system
in
which
you
push
it
from
the
inside
instead
of
from
the
outside
so
you
don't
have
to
go
between
the
cars.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
can't
say
it
was
caused
even
but
for
by--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
safety
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
that's
my
point
and
he
would
have
hurt
his
back
the
same
way.
