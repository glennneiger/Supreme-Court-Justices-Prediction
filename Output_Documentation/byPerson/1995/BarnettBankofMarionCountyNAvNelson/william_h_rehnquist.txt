chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-1837,
the
barnett
bank
of
marion
county
v.
bill
nelson,
florida
insurance
commissioner.
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lewin,
the
other
side
argues
that
there
is
a
public
motive,
that
you
don't
want
the
banks
too
closely
tied
up
with
the
insurance
in
connection
with
a
loan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
you
require
a
legislative
record,
mr.
lewin?
most
state
legislatures
don't
have
legislative
history.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
were
speaking
generally.
you
were
speaking
of
whether
a
state
law
would
be
valid,
and
you
said
if
there
was
a
sufficient
legislative
record.
why
is
that
a
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
think
congress
meant
there
had
to
be
an
inquiry
into
the
precise
legislative
motive
in
every
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can't
there
just
be
a
presumption
that
if
there
appears
to
be
a
purpose
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
that
probably
was
what
congress
talked
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
went
about
divining
the
purpose,
and
it
reached
a
particular
conclusion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lewin.
mr.
bress,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
that
definition
of
relates
to
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
those
cases
construing
this
particular
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
get
perhaps
closer
to
this
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
it
was
your
position
a
moment
ago
that
it
took
actual
congressional
consent
for
the
state
to
regulate
a
federally
chartered
institution,
not
just
lack
of
conflict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bress.
mr.
sumner,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
district
court
of
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sumner.
ms.
kappler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fellows,
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
kappler.
the
case
is
submitted.
