m.

are
there
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
where
a
state
has
what
on
its
face
appears
to
be
a
neutral
law
that
in
effect
prohibits
the
national
bank
from
acting
as
an
agent?
that
is
to
say,
a
state
would
have
a
law
that
no
agent
can
have
a
loan
relationship
with
the
customer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
sentence
justice
o'connor
refers
to
says
the
first
clause
of
2(b)
reverses
this
by
imposing
what
is
in
effect
a
clear
statement
rule,
a
rule
that
state
law
is
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance,
do
not
yield
to
conflicting
federal
statutes
unless
a
federal
statute
specifically
requires
otherwise.
are
we
going
to
have
to
ignore
that
language
to
rule
for
your
position
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
of
course
the
statute
doesn't
say
regulate,
it
says,
relates
to.
