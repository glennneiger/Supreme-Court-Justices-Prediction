mr.
lewin,
even
so,
why
can't
one
read
these
two
provisions,
the
state
and
federal,
as
compatible,
as
not
in
conflict?
the
federal
law
may
specifically
relate
to
insurance,
but
why
not...
as
one
of
your
opponents
argued,
why
not
read
the
federal
law
as
simply
giving
the
banks
permission
to
enter
this
line
of
business
which
it
couldn't
enter
without
federal
permission,
just
giving
it
federal
permission,
yet
subject
to
whatever
regulation
the
state
may
choose
to
put
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lewin--
--that's
what
he--
--when
you
say
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
is
the
regulator,
you
don't
mean
to
say,
do
you,
that
the
selling
of
insurance
by
the
bank--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--couldn't
be
regulated
by
florida?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
your
interpretation,
what,
then,
gives
the
state
the
right
to
regulate
the
selling
of
insurance
by
this
bank
if
you
say
it
needs
federal
permission,
the
state
needs
federal
permission?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sumner,
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
the
florida
law,
are
you
claiming
any
mileage
as
a
result
of
the
florida
supreme
court
decision?
you
mentioned
glendale.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
florida
supreme
court
decision
interpreting
this
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
only
the
district,
federal
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
a
state
intermediate
appellate
court,
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
do
claim
some
mileage,
some
extra
weight
beyond
what's
in
the
legislative
history
for
what
those
state
courts
say.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
legislative
history
that
was
recited
to
us
by
mr.
lewin,
that
congress
had
such
language
before
it
in
mccarran-ferguson
and
it
rejected
that
in
favor
of
the
broader,
specifically
relate
language?
