ms.
ann
mary
kappler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
eleventh
circuit
ruled
on
the
basis
of
mccarran
and
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
stressed
in
particular
the
mccarran
issue,
but
this
court
need
not
reach
the
mccarran
question,
because
even
under
traditional
preemption
there
is
no...
traditional
preemption
doctrine
there
is
no
preemption
here,
and
the
reason
is
simple.
a
state
law
that
treats
state
chartered
banks
and
nationally
chartered
banks
evenhandedly,
which
is
what
626.988
does,
does
not
interfere
with
the
objectives
of
congress
in
enacting
section
92
which,
as
stated
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
here
today,
was
to
enable
small,
nationally
chartered
banks
to
have
additional
revenue
in
order
to
enable
them
to
compete
with
state
chartered
banks--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--perhaps
i
overstated
it.
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to
say
he's
conceding
that
there's
preemption
here,
or
there's
no
preemption.
he
certainly
is
not.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
your
honor,
the
legislative
history,
and
although
it
is
very
scant
here,
there
is
one
letter
from
the
comptroller
who
drafted
this
legislation
and
proposed
it
to
the
congress,
who
accepted
that
proposal
as
written
and
in
fact
used
this
letter
as
explanation,
the
sole
explanation
for
the
statute.
that's--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--your
honor,
in
fact
the
letter
makes
absolutely
clear
that
what
the
comptroller
was
worried
about
was
allowing
them
to
get
additional
revenue,
but
additional
revenue
in
order
to
enable
them
to
compete
with
state-chartered
banks
who
had
these
very
powers,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
and
they
were
having
problems
competing
with
state
banks
who
had
this
authority.
your
honor,
it's
not
unremarkable--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--your
honor,
the
fellows
case
is
very
instructive.
there's
a
difference
between
a
nonbanking
power
and
a
banking
power,
and
the
fellows
court
articulated
the
difference.
the
courts
made
absolutely
clear,
and
the
petitioner
keeps
relying
on
the
provisions
of
the
fellows
case
dealing
with
banking
authority.
the
fellows
decision--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--yes,
correct,
your
honor,
first
national
bank
v.
fellows.
it's
cited
in
the
reply
brief
of
petitioners.
the
cite
is
244
u.s.
416.
it's
a
1917
case,
contemporaneous
with
the
enactment
of
section
92.
in
that
decision,
this
court
explained
that
when
it
comes
to
banking
powers,
the
incidental
powers,
of
course
congress
can
grant
those
authority
and
the
state
can't
interfere
with
those
unless
congress
says
they
can
interfere,
but
when
it
comes
to
nonbanking
powers...
and
there
it
was
the
power
to
act
as
an
administrator
for
stocks
and
bonds...
when
it
comes
to
nonbanking
powers,
congress
has
the
authority
to
grant
those
additional
nonbanking
powers
in
order
to
allow
the
national
banks
to
compete
with
these
state
charter
banks,
because
otherwise
they'd
suffer
injury
that
they
could
not
engage
in
their
banking
powers.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
in
those
areas,
in
the
exercise
of
those
nonbanking
powers,
the
principle
is
that
so
long
as
the
state
law
is
not
discriminatory,
the
national
banks
must
abide
by
the
state
laws.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
it
says
they're
fully
regulable
by
the
state,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
your
honor,
that's
what
the
fellows
case
was
talking
about.
that's
precisely
what--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--yes.
yes.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
at
issue
there
was
whether
michigan
law
would
have
allowed
them
to
engage
in
this
activity
or
not.
that's
precisely
what
the
case
was
about.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
i
don't
think
it's
the
commerce
power.
there
what
they
were
talking
about,
of
course,
your
honor,
was
the
fact,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
which
is
tied
to
the
currency
clause--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--well,
your
honor,
19--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--in
1916
it
was
not
a
commerce
power
because
congress
didn't
believe--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--no,
i'm
not
trying
to
suggest
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
it
could
not
have
said
that
the
national
bank
can
act...
enact...
act
this
way
and
the
state
can't
interfere.
all
i'm
saying
is--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--no,
your
honor.
i'm
talking--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
under
traditional
preemption
analysis
there
is
no
conflict
unless
there
is
an
interference
with
the
objectives
of
congress,
and
the
objectives
of
congress
as
stated
in
the
legislative
history
and
as
consistent
with
the
principles
articulated
by
the
supreme
court
at
the
time--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--were
to
enable
the
state
bank
to
compete.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
i'm
sorry.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
under
traditional
preemption
it
would--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--be
the
end
of
the
issue,
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
it
would
certainly
not
be
the
end
of
the
issue
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
and
in
fact--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--if
your--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
because
there's
no
interference
with
the
objectives
of
congress.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
correct,
although
it's
sort
of...
i
think
it's
difficult
to
think
of
whether
there's
an
intent
to
preempt,
your
honor,
because
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
is
absolutely
silent
on
its
effect
on
state
law.
the
question
is
sort
of
what
are
the
larger
objectives
the
congressmen--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--under
mccarran,
your
honor?
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
our
position.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
our
position
is
similar
to
mr....
and
exactly
the
same
as
mr.
sumner's
position,
is
that
in
order
to
specifically
relate
to
the
business
of
insurance,
it
is
a
clear
statement
rule.
the
clear
statement
is
that
congress
must
clearly--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--no,
your
honor.
that
would
be
an
easy
case,
but
it's
not
necessary.
what
they
must
clearly
state
is
that
in
fact
they
mean
to
displace
state
insurance
regulation.
that
is,
they
are
enacting
federal
insurance
regulation,
and
in
particular
regulation--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--your
honor,
i
think
the
only
language
rejected
is
the
language
that
would
require
an
actual
preemption
clause.
we're
not
saying
you
need
an
actual
preemption
clause.
if,
for
example,
the
federal
statute
says
every
life
insurance
policyholder
shall
have
5
days
to
review
a
life
insurance
policy
before
they
are
bound
by
the
terms
of
the
policy,
that
would
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
regulate
the
business
of
insurance,
not
just
insurance.
i
mean,
petitioner
would...
constantly
uses
the
word
insurance
as
if
that
were
sufficient.
every
mccarran
case
that
this
court
has
addressed
it's
not
sufficient--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--correct,
your
honor,
but
the
question
is
sort
of
what
is
relationship,
and
that's
precisely
what
this
court
looked
at
in
blue
cross
and
other
cases
in
which
they've
deemed,
what
is
the
relationship,
which
is
only
informed
by
knowing
what
the
purposes,
the
objectives
of
the
statute
were.
in
mccarran,
what
congress
has
tried
to
avoid,
everyone
agrees,
was
inadvertent
preemption,
inadvertent
application
of
law
to
the
business
of
insurance,
to
the
spreading,
the
transfer
of
risk,
the
protection
of
the
policyholder.
that's
how--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--mergers--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--because--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--if
i
might,
your
honor,
because
mergers,
as
the
court
held,
the
particular
arizona
merger
law
that
was
at
issue
it
concluded
was
in
fact
enacted
to
protect
stockholders,
not
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
policyholders.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
no,
your
honor,
if
it
protects
stockholders
it
is
not
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
insurance.
that's
what
national
securities--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--and--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--your
honor,
i
think
you're
echoing
the
difficulty
the
dissent
had
in
fabe
with
the
test
that
the
majority
set
up.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
but...
and
so
the
question
is,
how
close
must
the
protection
of
policyholders
be?
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
your
honor,
it
is
precisely
related
to
whether...
as
found
by
every
state
court
that
has
looked
at
this,
as
reflected
in
the
legislative
history,
as
confirmed
by
those
administrators,
that
it
goes
directly
to
whether
the
policyholder
can
purchase
a
policy
that
is
best
suited
for
him
or
whether
they
will
be
coerced
into
buying
a
policy
they
do
not
want
to
purchase.
that
particular
decision,
the
decision
whether
the
policy
is
one
that
is
appropriate
for
them,
that
was
the
design
behind
it.
that
is
the
nexus,
the
establishment
of
the
relationship
between
the
policyholder
and
the
insurer.
if
that
were--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--your
honor,
just
the
exceptions
you're
struggling
with
and
justice
souter
was
struggling
with,
the
glendale
court
struggled
with,
and
found
that
these
were
reasonable
decisions
the
court...
the
legislature
could
have
made,
and
in
fact
they
could
have
decided,
these
little
banks,
that
there
was
a
problem
with
the
accessibility
of
insurance
in
these
small
towns,
so
they--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--well,
it
also
found
that--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--no,
certainly
not.
certainly
not,
your
honor.
the
glendale
court
also
said
and
could
have
reasonably
found
they
didn't
have
enough
power.
similarly,
with
regard
to
credit
insurance,
the
court
decided...
the
glendale
court--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--your
honor...
i
did,
your
honor.
not
at
a
time
when
i
was
asking
for
a
loan,
your
honor.
but
at
the
time--
[laughter]
but
at
the
time...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
court
looked
at
this.
they
heard
evidence.
they
decided
this.
i
mean,
these
exceptions
don't
go
any
more
towards
what
petitioner
wants
to
say
the
statute
is.
petitioner
wants
to
say
this
statute
just
is
a
protection
for
insurance
agents.
well,
if
it
were
just
a
protection
for
independent
insurance
agents,
why
did
they
let
them
sell
credit
insurance?
we
ask
the
same
question.
those
exceptions
come
from
something
else.
the
legislature
has
made
hard
decisions,
hard
policy
decisions
where
to
draw
the
line,
and
has
allowed
it
to
sell
credit
insurance
because--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--but
your
honor,
the
purpose
is
estab...
the
purpose
is
articulated
in
the
preamble,
in
every
state
court
that
has
looked
at
it,
who
heard
evidence,
in
every...
i
mean,
in
fact,
your
honor,
we
have
established
it.
their
whole
argument
is,
it's
a
sham.
that's
their
whole
argument.
it's
a
sham.
the
only
way
you
can
do
that
is
to
ignore
what
florida
state
courts
have
definitively
said
unanimously,
without
any
contradiction,
is,
in
fact,
the
purpose
of
these
state
laws.
you
must
ignore
that
in
order
to
rule
in
petitioner's
favor,
and
there's
no
basis
for
doing
it
here,
absolutely
none.
