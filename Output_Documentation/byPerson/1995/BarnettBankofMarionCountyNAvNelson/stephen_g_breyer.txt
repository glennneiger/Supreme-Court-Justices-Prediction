justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose--
--when
you
say
clear...
i
thought
i
interrupted.
no,
go
ahead,
you
were...
please.
it
was
simultaneous.
the...
suppose
a
state
passes
a
law...
i
mean,
the
question
to
me
at
the
beginning
is
whether
this
is
a
law
that
regulates
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
suppose
a
state
says...
and
the
test
can't
be
just
whether
it
helps
policyholders,
is
it?
i
mean,
suppose
a
state
says,
i
know
a
great
way
of
helping
our
policyholders.
when
an
insurance
company
gets
into
trouble
under
this
statute,
no
insurance
company
has
to
pay
their
federal
income
tax.
i
didn't
see
anything
in
the
federal
income
tax
law
that
refers
specifically
to
insurance,
so
what
is
it
that
would
make
that
statute
be
invalid?
i'm
helping...
in
our
state
in
florida
we
think
it's
really
nice,
particularly
towns
under
5,000,
where,
you
know,
they
have
a
tough
time,
and
they
really
don't
want
to
pay
their
taxes,
and
they're
shaky,
and
the
policyholder
will
be
hurt.
what's
the
law?
what's
the
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right
at
the
core,
making
money
out
of
the
policy,
keeping
the
money
there
available
for
the
policyholders
so
that
the
company
won't
go
bankrupt,
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
like
from...
that's
rates,
regulating
selling
and
advertising,
licensing
companies
and
their
agents,
and
relationship
between
the
insured
and
the
insurer.
i
take
it
that
that
kind
of
thing
is
right
out
of
sec
v.
national
securities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well
then,
i
don't
see
how
you
fit
within
it,
because
how
do
you
fit
within
it?
why
isn't
this
case
more
like
the
merger
case?
mergers
between
two
insurance
companies
aren't
protected.
this
has
to
do
with
whether
a
bank
holding
company
could
own
an
insurance
company
which,
after
all,
a
small
bank
could
own.
i
mean,
which
bank
owns...
which
kind
of
a
bank?
some
banks
can
own.
small
banks
can
own
insurance
agents.
national
banks
can't.
all
right,
under
this
test,
what's
the
difference
between
who
can
own
the
insurance
agent,
a
big
bank
or
a
little
bank,
and
the
question
of
mergers
and
banks,
both
being
quite
different
from
regulating
the
terms
of
a
contract?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
every...
i
mean,
that's
what
i'd
like
us...
can
you
just
spend
a
minute
helping
me
out
with
that?
the...
my
impression
from
reading
pireno
and
the
sec,
the
cases
that
we
talked
about,
is
that
this
is
rather
narrow,
this
word,
regulation
of
insurance,
and
really
refers
to
where
the
policyholder...
what
do
you
charge
him,
what
are
the
terms
of
the
contract,
et
cetera.
this
is
a
statute
that
says
big
banks
but
not
little
banks
can
go
into
the
insurance
businesses
in
small
towns...
the
opposite,
big
banks
can't,
little
banks
can.
to
me,
is
this
more
like
a
merger?
i.e.,
what
are
the
entities
that
own
these
agents,
and
mergers
are
outside
the
word
regulation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the...
what
those
words
say
in
a
contract
are
inside
regulation.
why
isn't
this
more
like
the
first
than
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
need
a
little
help
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
in
fact,
if
that's
the
key,
then
we
go
back
to
a
law
that
says
they
don't
have
to
pay
income
tax,
they
don't
have
to
comply
with
a
whole
bunch
of
things,
because
that
protects
stockholders.
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
we
could--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
go
back
to
the
income
tax
and
all
these
exemptions
that
will
protect
policyholders.
that
can't
be
the
law,
i
wouldn't
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
absolutely
am.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
fabe
seemed
to
be
a
case
in
which
the
court
majority
held
that
the
policyholder
has
a
secured
interest
in
the
money
that
will
go
to
pay
off
that
policy,
and
if
that's
so,
fabe
is
a
case
that's
pretty
closely
related
to
the
very
dollars
that
are
going
to
pay
the
policyholder,
much
more
close
to
the
words
of
the
contract
than
to
a
merger
of
the
entities
owning.
