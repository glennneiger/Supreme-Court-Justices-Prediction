justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lewin,
i
assume
that
the
florida
courts
and
the...
or
the
eleventh
circuit's
view
of
the
matter
is
that
the
florida
statute
is
a
statute
that
governs
insurance.
it's
about
insurance.
the
federal
statute
is
a
statute
that's
about
banks.
now,
what
it
says
banks
can
do
is
sell
insurance,
but
i
think
what
the
eleventh
circuit
says
is
that
doesn't
specifically
relate
to
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
because
the
provision
is
about
banks.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you
that
any
legislation
that
regulates
insurance
relates
to
insurance,
but
does
any
legislation
that
regulates
insurance
specifically
relate
to
insurance?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
regulate
it...
can't
you
regulate
insurance
in
passing?
i
mean,
that's
the
argument
made
here,
that
really
they...
the
federal
legislation
may...
you
may
even
say
it
regulated
insurance,
but
it
did
it
only
in
passing,
not
specifically.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
motive
wouldn't
explain
allowing
banks
that
are
not
part
of
bank
holding
companies
to
do
it,
would
it?
as
i
understand
the
florida
statute,
it
doesn't
prohibit
all
banks.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
rationale
of
stopping
banks,
the
procompetitive
rationale
of
preventing
banks
from
getting
all
of
the
business
when
they
make
the
real
estate
loan,
that
makes
no...
no
reason
to
limit
it
to
nonbank
holding
companies.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know.
what
about
some
other
thing
that
only
bank...
any
characteristic
that
is
possessed
exclusively
by
banks
or
at
least
is
possessed
by
all
banks.
are
you
saying
that
no
such
characteristic
may
be
made
the
basis
of
state
regulation?
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
state
regulations
of
insurance,
including
that
sold
by
banks,
continues
to
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
a
regulation
that
says
you
cannot
be
an
insurance
agent
if
you're
also
the
lender.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
it
wouldn't,
but
i
am
much
less
inclined
to
come
out
the
way
you
would
like
me
to
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
section
92
specifically
relates
to
insurance.
i
am
less
inclined
to
do
it
if
i'm
worried
about
what
effect
i'm
going
to
be
having
on
state
regulation,
including
a
regulation
which
seems
to
me
perfectly
reasonable
that
the
insurer
can't
be
the
lender.
you're
saying
that
would
be
bad,
that
would
be
good?
what
is
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
would
be
okay.
no
insurance...
the
lender
can't
be
the
insurance
agent.
that's
going
to
be
the
next
statute
that
florida
passes.
you
know
that's
coming
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bress,
can
you
help
us
out
on
what...
if
section
92
is
read
the
way
you
wish,
what
kind...
you
know,
you
could
say
the
bank
could
sell
insurance,
period,
and
the
state
can't
stop
it
from
selling
insur...
you
don't
take
that
position.
you
say,
the
state
can
continue
to
regulate
that
sale
of
insurance,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
what
if
it
says
lenders
can't
sell
insurance?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can
think
of
all
sorts
of
other
things
that
banks
are
which
you
might
want
to
regulate
for
the
purpose
of
insurance,
and
you're
saying...
i
don't
understand
how
you
draw
that
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
state
can't
regulate
anything
that
is
a
power...
or
cannot
exclude
from
insurance
agency
any
power
that
is
a
power
accorded
to
banks
by
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
lending
money,
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
apply
to
banks.
it
applies
to
big
banks.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
no
statute
pursues
its
objectives
at
all
costs,
and
the
legislature
just
said
there's
such
a
overwhelming
reason
why
a
bank
would
want
to
sell
its
own
insurance
in
these
situations
that
although
the
same
risks
might
exist,
we
won't
extend
our
prohibition
that
far.
that's
possible,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
limit
the
terms
of
a
statute
by
its
purpose.
i
mean,
if
the
purpose
of
enabling
them
to
sell
insurance
was
to
enable
them
to
compete,
we
don't
read
into
the
statute
they
can
sell
insurance
only
when
it
is
necessary
to
enable
them
to
compete.
congress
passes
lots
of
laws
for
purposes
which
do
not
require
as
much
as
congress
confers
in
the
law.
what
the
law
says
is
that
they
can
sell
insurance,
and
it
not
only
says
that,
it
says
in
addition
to
the
powers
now
vested
by
law
in
national
banks...
in
addition
to
those
other
powers.
do
you
know
any
other
power
that
a
national
bank
has
which
can
be
eliminated
by
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
contend
that
here.
they
don't
contend
that
they
need
not
abide
by
state
laws.
does
that
case
hold
that
those
nonbanking
powers
can
be
eliminated
by
the
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
acknowledge
that
they're
regulable
here.
mr.
lewin
said
they're
regulable.
what
we're
talking
about
is
whether
they
can
be
eliminated.
does
this
case
say
they
can
be
eliminated?
justice
antonin
scalia
big
banks
can
coerce
and
little
banks
can't
coerce?
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
let
the
little
banks
coerce.
that's
what
you'd
like--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
they
need
the
money,
so
we'll
let
the
little
banks
coerce
but
not
the
big
banks.
i
can't
believe
that
that's
what
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
it
didn't
have
enough
power
to
coerce?
they're
making
you
the
loan.
i
mean--
--you
didn't
grow
up
in
a
small
town.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
have
to
establish
the
purpose.
you
have
to
establish
the
purpose.
i
mean,
it
may
give
as
many
problems
to
him
as
it
does
to
you,
but
it's
not
part
of
his
case.
