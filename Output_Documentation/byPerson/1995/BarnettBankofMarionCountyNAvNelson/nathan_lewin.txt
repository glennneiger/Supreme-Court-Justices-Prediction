mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
validity
of
a
florida
statute
enacted
in
1974
that
flatly
prohibits
financial
institutions
such
as
banks,
including
national
banks,
from
selling
life
and
fire
insurance.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
upheld
the
florida
law
on
the
remarkable
proposition
that
a
law
that
prohibits
banks
from
selling
life
insurance
is,
within
the
meaning
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
a
law
that
regulates
the
business
of
insurance,
while
a
1916
federal
law
that
explicitly
does
the
contrary
and
authorizes
national
banks
to
sell
life
insurance
is
not,
within
the
meaning
of
the
very
same
mccarran-ferguson
act,
a
law
that
specifically
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance.
the
statement
of
that
proposition
is,
we
submit,
its
own
refutation.
flatly
prohibiting
all
banks
from
engaging
in
the
business
of
being
an
insurance
agent
is,
we
believe,
not
a
bona
fide
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance,
but
if
it
is,
then
its
converse,
the
1916
federal
law
that
authorizes
national
banks
to
do
precisely
what
the
florida
law
prohibits...
that
is,
to
sell
life
insurance
through
licensed
agents...
must
be
a
law
that
specifically
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance.
now,
that
language
that
i've
been
referring
to...
regulates
the
business
of
insurance
or
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance...
grows
out
of
the
two
pronged
test
of
validity
prescribed
by
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
whenever
an
act
of
congress
conflicts
with
any
law
enacted
by
any
state.
the--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--the
statutes,
justice
scalia,
of
course
use
the
word
regulate
in
the
first
portion
of--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--the
section,
and
it
says
that
the
state
law,
in
order
to
even
satisfy
the
first
of
these
two
hurdles,
has
to
have
as
its
purpose
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
the
broader
term
is
the
second
term.
the
second
term
speaks
about
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance.
it
appears
to
us,
certainly,
you
can't,
even...
even
if
a
statute
speaks
about
banks,
it
also
relates
to
insurance
if
it
says,
as
the
1916
law
does,
specifically
that
banks
may
sell
insurance
policies,
if--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--it
does,
justice--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--but
the
word
specifically,
we
submit,
means
to
distinguish
between
the
statutes
that
would
include
insurance
within
some
broader
statutory
term,
commercial
services,
various
kind...
but
certainly
a
statute
specifically
relates
to
insurance
when
the
word
insurance
appears
in
that
statute
five
times.
if
the
court
will
look
at
section
92,
which
appears
at
1a
and
2a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
life...
fire...
life
or
other
insurance
is
specified
in
there,
and
the
word
insurance
appears
explicitly
in
that
statute
on
five
different
occasions.
nothing
could
be
more--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--justice
ginsburg,
there
are
several
answers,
i
think,
to
that
question.
first
of
all,
because
the
statute
does
not
specifically
say
that.
congress
knew
how
it
could
say,
as
our
adversaries
say,
national
banks
are
simply
empowered
to
engage
in
the
business
of
selling
insurance
if
the
state
permits
them
to
do
so.
the
statute,
section
92,
submits
the
national
bank
only
to
the
authority
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
it
says
the
insurance
company
whose
policies
are
being
sold
has
to
be
a
company
which
is
authorized
by
the
state
authorities.
it
does
not
say
that
the
national
bank
has
to
be
authorized
by
the
state
authorities,
and
the
congress
that
considered
and
enacted
section
92,
the
very
same
congress,
also
considered
the
question
of
branch
banking.
when
it
did
so,
and
this
appears
i
think
more
extensively
in
an
amicus
brief
that's
filed
by
a
whole
group
of
banking,
local
state
banking
associations,
the
court
can
see,
i
think,
at
page
13
of
that
brief
where
congress
put
into
the
branch
banking
provisions
that
it
was
considering
language
which
would
have
subjected
the
national
banks
to
the
authority
of
the
state
before
they
could
open
branch
banks.
congress
didn't
do
that
with
section
92,
so
our
first
point
is
that
the
statutory
language
argues
against
that
reading.
our
second
point
is
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
constant
interpretation
argues
against
that
reading.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
of
course,
is
the
one
who
is
authorized
to
administer
this
authority
under
section
92.
this
court
very
recently
in
its
valic
decision
pointed
out
how
the
court
gave
deference
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
since
the
enactment
of
this
law
has
always
read
it
as
meaning
that
the
national
banks
have
authority
independently
of
what
the
state
may
or
may
not
do.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
absolutely
not,
justice
ginsburg.
we
agree
that
the
qualifications
of
the
agents
who
are
selling
is
subject
to
all
the
state
laws.
the
state
licensure
laws
which
apply
to
all
insurance
agents
would
apply
to
those
who
would
sell
it
on
behalf
of
the
banks,
and
we're
not
arguing
that
the
entire
state
licensure
system
is
preempted
or
replaced.
our
adversaries
are
trying
to
make
the
court
believe
that
maybe
that's
the
consequence
of
our
position.
it
is
not
at
all.
what
we
are
saying
is,
banks
under
section
92
are
permitted
to
sell
insurance,
and
then
subject
to
the
regulation,
of
the
kind
of
regulation
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
mccarran-ferguson.
it
knew
that
prior
to
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
there
was
a
whole
web
of
regulation
on
the
part
of
the
states
of
the
business
of
insurance,
including
the
licensure
of
agents,
and
consequently
when
it
enacted
mccarran-ferguson
it
maintained
that
system
of
regulation
in
place,
but
when
a
state
comes
in
after
the
fact
and
for
motives
that
are
not
the
protection
of
policyholders
with
regard
to
the
integrity
or
the
ability
of
insurance
agents,
but
which
are
anticompetitive
motives,
and
we
think
that
clearly
emerges
from
this,
the
history
of
this
statute
as
well--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--we
understand
that
that
is
what
they
are
saying.
that
is...
first
of
all,
that
is
contrary
to
the
preamble
that
the...
this
statute
had
when
it
was
first
put
in,
and
there
is
no
other
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
that
there
was
a
motive
other
than
the
motives
which
the
preamble
set
out,
but--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--it
does
not
prohibit
banks
that
are
in
communities
of
less
than
5,000
that
are
not
subsidiary
to
bank
holding
companies.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true.
that
distinction
would
not
make
sense
in
that
context.
i
mean,
you
can't...
it
doesn't
carry
across
to
all
banks.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
true
there
are
really
a
number
of
very
good
rational
arguments
that
demonstrate
that
this
is
not
the
purpose.
this
is...
protection
of
consumers
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
the
lines
that
are
drawn,
the
legislative
history,
the
fact
that
the
statute
invokes
the
bank
holding
company
act.
it
doesn't
say,
we're
doing
this
because
of
the
authority
we
have
under
mccarran-ferguson
to
regulate
insurance.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
that
goes
too
far.
it
would...
there's
almost
any
kind
of
law
that
would
affect
insurance
could
be
dressed
up
or
could
be
explained
after
the
fact
in
that
way.
indeed--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--this
court's
opinions--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--we
think
it
would
not...
it
would
not
be
an
effective
and
useful
distinction,
and
indeed,
this
court's
opinions
in
pireno
and
in...
in
the
prior
cases,
where
the
court
was
considering
these,
the
court
rejected
the
argument
that
simply
looking
to
either
the
solvency
of
the
insurance
company,
whether
it
would
ultimately
be
solvent,
whether
it
would...
and
its
impact
on
policyholders
was
a
sufficient
basis
for
saying
that
its
purpose
was
the
regulation--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--of
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
the
pireno
case
does
lay
down
three
standards
that
make
it
clear
that
what
we're
dealing
with
is
really
the
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
the
policyholder.
this
is
not
a
statute
that
deals
with
the
regulation
of
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
the
pireno
definitions.
and
this
court
has
said
in
the
fabe
case,
which
is
this
court's
most
recent
examination
of
this
statute,
and
indeed
one
of
only
two,
the
court
said
in
fabe
that
the
only
time
it
has
previously
looked
at
this
language
specifically
about
the
regulation
of
insurance
was
in
the
national
securities
case,
which
involved
the
application
of
the
securities
laws
to
insurance
companies
and
their
ability
to
deal
with
potential
stockholders
and
that
regulation.
but
the
court
said
in
fabe
also
that
the
key
test,
the
standard
as
to
whether
this
was
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance,
turned
upon
whether
it
dealt
with
the
relationship
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
policyholders,
the
actual
implementation
of
that
policy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know,
off-hand,
of
any...
the
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
have
involved
more
specific...
i
mean,
the
owensboro
case
and
the
louisiana
case
that
has
come
up
through
the
louisiana
courts
have
involved
more
specific
statutes
that
are
directed,
really,
at
financial
institutions
or
banks
rather
than
in
this
more
indirect
manner
to
my
knowledge,
but
i
think
the
same
question
would
come
up
if,
in
fact,
the
state
were
trying
to
reach
national
banks'
power
under
section
92
by
camouflaging
what
they
were
really
doing
by
making
it
appear
to
be
a
different--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
there
are--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--that
would
apply.
let
me
say
first,
justice
scalia,
that
only
applies
to
the
first
prong,
or
the
first
hurdle.
it
may
be,
and
i'm
not
questioning
that
if
a
state
in
fact
had
a
legislative
record
that
indicated
that
banks
in
some
way
were
deceiving
insurance
customers
that
it
could
not
enact
a
statute
that
would
reach
that
kind
of
practice
even
if
what
they
did
is,
they
did
it
in
terms
of
reaching
banks,
but
that
would
not
affect
the
question
of
whether
section
92
goes
beyond
that
and
specifically
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
think
a
more
narrow
statute
that
would
reach
certain
kinds
of
practices
would
certainly
be
good.
i'm
not
questioning...
we
have
no
problem
with
regulatory
statutes
that
reach
practices
rather
than
eliminate
categories
of--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--any
lender
to
this
consumer--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no.
i
think...
if
the
purpose
of
that
statute,
if
the
legislative
record
doesn't
demonstrate
that
that
is
designed
to
protect
consumers
and
it's
really
a
way
of
getting
around
section
92,
i
think
it
would
present
a
problem.
we'd
be
back
in
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true,
but
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
think
because
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
congress
has
said
so.
congress
has
said,
enacted
by
any
state
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
when
congress
says
purpose,
and
has
used
that
in
the
statute,
then
i
think
for
purposes
of
that
hurdle,
the
court
does
have
to
look
at
purpose.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
a
possible
legal
rule,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i'm
saying
nonetheless
the
court
has
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
the
statute
says,
purpose,
and
in
some
way
it
has
to
devine
what
the
purpose
was
in
enacting
the
statute.
congress
could
have
eliminated
the
word,
purpose.
it
could
simply
have
said,
enacted
by
any
statute,
by
any
state
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
we
submit
that
conclusion
is
simply
not
justified
for
purposes,
again,
of
the
first
prong
of
the
test.
i
have
to
keep
emphasizing...
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
i
would
have
to
keep
emphasizing
that
that's
only
one
prong
of
two
prongs
that
this
statute...
two
hurdles
that
this
florida
statute
has
to
satisfy:
1)
it
has
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance,
and
2)
the
federal
statute
with
which
it
conflicts
has
to
be
one
that
does
not
specifically
relate
to
the
business
of
insurance,
and
we
submit
section
92
plainly
specifically
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance.
thank
you.
