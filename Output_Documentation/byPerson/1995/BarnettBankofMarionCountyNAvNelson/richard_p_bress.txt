mr.
richard
p.
bress
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
section
92
of
title
12,
congress
authorized
national
banks
located
in
small
towns
to
serve
as
insurance
agents.
section
92
enables
those
banks
to
earn
an
additional
source
of
revenue
to
supplement
the
income
that
they
earn
in
more
traditional
banking
activities.
in
the
comptroller's
view,
national
banks
located
in
small
towns
need
to
earn
that
sort
of
supplemental
fee-based
income
to
remain
competitive
with
other
financial
institution
lenders.
to
the
extent
that
florida's
antiaffiliation
law
prohibits
national
banks
from
selling
insurance
in
small
towns,
it
frustrates
congress'
intentions
and
impairs
the
efficiency
with
which
the
national
banks
in
small
towns
can
carry
on
their
statutory
functions.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
this
court
has
interpreted
the
term,
relates
to,
frequently
and
recently.
one
thing
relates
to
another
if
it
refers
to
or
has
any
connection
with
the
other.
if--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
this
court
used
that
definition...
in
fact,
you
used
other
broader
terms
in
morales
and
in
shaw.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
i
was...
your
honor,
i
was
just
getting
to
the
words
relates
to.
i
will
move
on
if
you'd
like
and--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--certainly.
if
this
statute
merely
said,
relates
to,
then
mccarran-ferguson
would
arguably
accept
any
federal
law
that
has
any
connection
with
interstate
commerce.
congress
did
not
intend
that
broader
scope.
congress
added
the
modifier,
specifically,
to
make
clear
that
state
insurance
law
would
be
preempted
only
when
congress
has
referred
to,
focused
on,
or
acted
specifically
with
reference
to
the
business
of
insurance.
therefore,
if
section
92,
which
is
at
issue
here,
merely
authorized
national
banks
to
engage
in
commerce,
that
statute
would
not
specifically
relate
to
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
in
its...
i
agree,
in
its
description
of
that
prong
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
test,
this
court
stated
that
it
was
a
plain
statement
rule
and
used
language
to
that
effect.
it
was
not
a
holding,
however,
of
fabe,
and
this
court
has
reminded
us
often--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
i
guess
that
would
depend
what
clear
statement
meant.
if
the
clear
statement
had
to
be
congress
saying,
not
only
can
banks
do
this
but
we
also
affirmatively
preempt
state
law
to
the
contrary,
no,
this
wouldn't
pass
it,
but
the
language
that
congress
actually
used
here,
specifically
relates
to,
does
not
require
that
sort
of
statement.
congress,
when
it
was
passing
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
had
in
the
bill
that
originally
went
to
the
committee
language
that
would
have
done
that.
that
language
said,
unless
the
act
specifically
so
requires.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
you
may
well,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that
language
did
not
accurately
describe
the
text
of
the
statute
as
it
actually
reads.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
we
would
find
in
most
cases--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--in
almost
all
cases
you
would
want
to
find
the
word
insurance,
or
at
least
other
words
that
meant
insurance,
in
the
statute
itself,
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
exactly.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
right.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
i
don't
think
you
would.
i
think
that
would
be
a
correct
definition,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
to
statutes
that
specifically
refer
to
insurance
either
in
so
many
words
or
not.
i
think
that
would
be
the
correct
definition.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
right.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
been
the
comptroller's
consistent
position.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
a
statement
of
lenders
can't
sell
insurance
would,
in
our
view,
conflict
with
section
92's
directive
that
banks
which
are
lenders
under
24,
section
24,
can
sell
insurance,
so
there
would
be
an
express
conflict--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
you
may
well
want
to...
states
may
well
want
to
regulate
lots
of
things
that
banks
are,
but
to
the
degree
that
states
purport
to
prohibit
banks,
because
they
are
those
things,
because
the
federal
legislation
has
made
banks
those
things,
from
selling
insurance,
you'd
have
a
conflict
with
federal
law.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--i
think
if
the
state
attempted
to
pick
out
a
power
that
the
federal
government
has
given
to
banks
and
that
banks
possess,
and
use
that
as
a
characteristic
for
excluding
those
entities
for
insurance,
it
would
be
preempted
by
federal
law.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
question,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
one.
i
would
probably
venture
to
say--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--the
comptroller
has
not
spoken
to
it.
i'd
like
to
speak
to
the
preemption
issue
a
bit
more
generally,
if
i
may.
there's
been
an
argument
by
respondent
that
the...
there's
a
presumption
against
preemption,
and
while
that's
ordinarily
true
when
you've
got
federal
and
state
laws
that
deal
with
private
persons,
here
you've
got
an
attempt
by
a
state
to
regulate
a
federal
instrumentality.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
franklin
national
bank,
the
federal
government
is
a
rival
chartering
authority,
and
when
the
states
presume
to
control
the
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government,
this
court
has
stated
over
and
over
that
that
sort
of
control
can
only
be
exercised
with
congress'
consent,
and
in
franklin
national
bank,
this
court
made
a
point
of
pointing
out
various
statutes
in
which
congress
has
expressly
said,
national
banks
may
do
this
only
if
state
banks
may
as
well
do
it,
or
national
banks
may
do
it
subject
to
state
authority.
in
franklin
national
bank,
it
was
critical
that
that
statute,
which
used
language
like
this
statute,
may
language,
did
not
have
that
sort
of
state
authorization.
this
case
really
should
come
out
no
differently
than
franklin
national
bank
in
that
regard.
the
same
point
was
made,
by
the
way,
by
the
court
in
the
easton
case
as
well
as
in
the
fellows
case.
getting
back
to
the
specifically
relates
point
to
a
moment,
i'd
like
to
reiterate
that
this
statute
not
only
mentions
insurance
but
mentions
it
five
times.
it
specifies
which
types
of
bank,
what
banks
may
sell
insurance,
what
companies
they
may
sell
insurance
for,
it
says
who
can
put
out
the
rules
and
regulations
for
insurance,
and
it
has
two
express
limitations
on
the
sale
of
insurance.
there's
no
question
that
congress
focused
very
specifically
on
insurance
when
it
enacted
section
92,
and
that
the
statute
is
one
that
relates
specifically
to
insurance.
now,
while--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--the
federal
government
has
not
actually
regulated
the
selling
of
insurance
by
national
banks,
and
the
absence
of
regulation
by
the
federal
government
would
mean
that
there
would
be
no
conflict
with
ordinary
state
rules
regulating
it.
the
other
thing
is--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
i
may
have
spoken
too
broadly.
it
does
require
consent,
but
this
court
has
assumed
a
background
of
consent
to
general
state
laws.
for
example,
state
laws
regarding
contracts,
collection
of
debt,
that
sort
of
thing
have
always
applied
to
national
banks.
it's
only
where
the
state
attempts
to
regulate
the
bank
as
bank
where
the
state
has
gotten
into
difficulty.
