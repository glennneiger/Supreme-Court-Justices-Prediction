but
there's
a
narrower
interpretation
other
than
just,
banks
can't...
lenders
can't
sell
insurance.
what
if
the
regulation
says
the
insurance
broker
cannot
sell
to
a
policyholder
who
is
indebted
to
the
agent?
they
could
sell
generally.
i
mean,
lenders
could
sell,
but
not...
they
couldn't
tie
the
two
together,
prohibit
tying
clauses--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
comptroller
general
hasn't
spoken
to
that,
anyway.
