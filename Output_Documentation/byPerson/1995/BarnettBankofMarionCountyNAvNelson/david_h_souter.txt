justice
david
h.
souter
the
statute
doesn't
refer
to--
--mr.
lewin,
are
there...
go
ahead.
the
statute
doesn't
cover
credit
life
either,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
would
be,
i
suppose,
the
field
in
which
you
would
assume
the
banks
would
be
most
overbearing
in
trying
to
exercise
their
authority,
and
yet
that's
exempted.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument,
the
kind
of
subsidiary
argument,
to
be
sure,
but
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
because
the
effect
is
to
regulate
what
your
opponents
describe
as
the
point
of
sale
of
the
insurance,
that
therefore
you
simply
must
impute
a
purpose
to
regulate
insurance
to
that
effect,
and
therefore
the
purpose
prong
of
the
statute
is
satisfied?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
would
read
the
intent
requirement
out
of
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
a
distinction
it
would
read
the
intent
requirement
out,
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
have
to
have
gone
the
other
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
follow
the
position
that
senator
ferguson
has
been
quoted
as
taking,
we
would
require
at
least
that
there
be...
i'm
sorry,
we
would
require
that
there
be
an
express
reference
to
insurance,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
an
express
reference
to
preemption,
but
an
express
reference
to
insurance.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
kind
of
other
words
do
you...
you
mean
reference
to
specific
policies,
things
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
some
verbal
insurance
reference,
not
necessarily
the
word
insurance.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
we
be
in
error
if
we
confined...
if
we
in
fact
defined
the
specific
relate
to
language
in
that
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
limited
it
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
so
many
words
have
got
to
be
words
that
either
include
the
word
insurance
or
refer
to,
what,
an
insurance
product,
or
a
peculiar
insurance
practice?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
the
object
why
did
they
accept
credit
life?
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
maybe
i
don't
understand.
that,
it
would
seem
to
me,
would
increase
the
likelihood
that
the
bank
would
in
fact
unduly
use
its
power
to
influence
the
issue
of,
the
issuance
of
this
insurance.
if
the
bank
wants
to
be
insured
against
anything,
it
wants
to
be
insured
against
losing
its
loan
return
because
of
debt,
so
i
should
suppose
the
bank's
temptation
would
be
very
high
there.
why
was
it
accepted?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if...
but
it's
a
legislative
judgment
that
seems
to
me
to
be
at
odds
with
the
rationale
that
you
were
saying
was
the
legislative
purpose
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
suppose
i
don't
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
any
of
this
and
think,
well,
gee,
to
a
person
looking
at
this
statute,
the
only
purpose
i
can
imagine
it
would
have
is
that
it
wants
to
help
the
little
banks
make
more
money
by
preventing
the
competition
from
the
big
banks,
and
it
wants
to
raise
the
prices
to
the
insurers
who
are
buying
the
policies,
and
as
a
result,
everybody
is
more
secure.
so
it's
a
good
insurance
purpose...
make
everybody
more
secure,
they
make
more
money,
there's
less
competition,
less
chance
of
default.
all
right,
suppose
i
thought
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
want,
by
stopping
competition,
to
make
everybody
make
more
money
and
the
insured
then
has
a
better
chance
of
getting
a
payoff
on
his
policy.
then
does
it
fall
within
the
mccarran
act,
any
more
than,
let's
say,
the
mergers
between
the
two
companies?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it's
outside
the
mccarran
act's
exception.
in
other
words,
you
lose
the
case
unless
you
have
some
other
policy
just...
some
other
reason
for
this
statute,
other
than
just
stopping
competition.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
why
would
that
be?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
the...
i
mean,
i
grant
you
that
you'd
like
to
say
it
has
other
purposes.
i
understand
that,
but
i
don't
see
why,
in
terms
of
the
act,
it
matters.
i
don't
see
why,
in
terms
of
the
exemption,
it
matters
whether
the
purpose
is
an
anticompetitive
purpose,
a
procompetitive
purpose,
or
what
kind
of
purpose.
in
either
case,
your
purpose
would
be
to
help
the
policyholder
get
a
payoff
on
his
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
purpose
here
is
to
keep
the
big
banks
out.
that's
virtually
disputed,
keep
the
big
banks
out,
and
the
question
i
would
think
would
be
is,
is
that
a
regulatory
purpose,
and
exactly
why
you'd
want
to
keep
the
big
banks
out
i
would
think
would
be
almost
beside
the
point,
but
i'm
not
sure.
that's
why
i
ask.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
quite
that
easy.
the
solicitor
general
did
not,
i
think,
concede
or
suggest
that
this
was
kind
of
an
equal
protection
clause
for
competition.
the
object
which
the
solicitor
general
argues
is
behind
the
section
92
is
indeed
a
competitive
object,
but
his
argument
is
that
one
way
to
provide
that
competition
is
to
allow
them
to
sell
the
insurance,
period.
he
didn't
concede,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
was
simply
to
put
them
on
an
equal
footing
in
the
sale
of
insurance
with
state
banks.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
he
wasn't
conceding
that
there
was...
there
was
kind
of,
as
i
put
it,
an
equal
protection
clause
here
for
state
and
federal
banks,
and
in
fact
the
argument
is,
for
which
there
has
been
i
think
some
evidence
adduced
here
in
the
courtroom,
that
in
fact
the
point
of
the
statute
was
to
allow
them
to
get
into
the
insurance
business
so
that
they
could
earn
money
and,
generally
speaking,
be
more
competitive
against
their
state
rivals,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
you've
got
to
refute
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
drafting
of
the
statute
is
consistent
with
that
in
the
sense
that
the
statute
says
nothing
about,
may
sell
insurance
if
state
banks
sell
insurance,
may
sell
it
if
state
regulation
allows.
it
simply
gave
them
a
power
to
sell,
and
i
would
suppose
that
was
consistent
with
the
letter.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
sure,
if
they
go
out
of
business
they
can't
compete,
but
i
mean,
the
argument
was,
they
need
the
additional
revenue
because,
given
the
sort
of
piddling
deposits
that
they
tend
to
get
in
these
little
towns,
they
just
can't
earn
enough
money
to
stay
in
business
if
they
haven't
got
some
other
revenue
source.
wasn't
that
basically
the
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
commerce
power
is
limited,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
power
to
regulate
insurance
is
a
commerce
power,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
were
saying
insofar
as
it
involves
banks,
it
doesn't
relate
specifically
to
banking,
there
is
a
limitation,
and
hence
it
must
be
a
limitation
on
the
commerce
power.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is
now,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
consequence
of
your
argument.
am
i
missing
a
step?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
back...
it
seems
to
me
you're
back
to
the
clear
statement
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
if
they
say
it
clearly
enough,
they
can
do
it.
if
they
don't
say
it
clearly
enough,
they
can't
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
do
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
you
off.
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
you
agree
then,
i
take
it,
that
if
we
do
conclude
that
congress
was
quite
clear
in
its
intent
to
allow
banks
to
do
this,
period,
that's
the
end
of
the
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
simply
because
we
have
two
other
steps.
i'm
just
dealing
with
your
first
point,
your
first
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
your
first
argument
is,
there's
no
preemption
because
there's
no
conflict.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
everything
turns
on
whether
we
conclude
that
congress
did,
indeed,
intend
to
give
the
banks
the
power
to
do
this
free
of
the
right
of
a
state
to
eliminate
it
entirely,
and
if
we
say
yes,
that
was
congress'
intent,
then
we
get
into
mccarran-ferguson.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that
then
gets
us
into
the
third
issue,
and
i
take
it
your
position
there
is
that
in
order
to
preempt
the
preemption
it's
got
to
be
expressed,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
necessarily
a
clear
statement
of
preemption.
you
don't
take
that
position.
