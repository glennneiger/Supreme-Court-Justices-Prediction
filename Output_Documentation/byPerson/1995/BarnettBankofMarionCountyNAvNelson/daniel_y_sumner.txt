mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
enacting
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
congress
has
broadly
reserved
to
the
states
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance
and
declared
that
state
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance
is
in
the
public
interest.
congress'
intent
to
throw
the
weight
of
its
power
behind
state
regulation
is
clearly
expressed
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
the
department
of
insurance's
position
is
that
once
a
state
law
is
established
to
regulate
the
business
of
insurance
by
protecting
policyholders,
that
state
law
is
preempted
by
a
federal
law
only
if
the
federal
law
is
a
clear
statement
that
congress
intended
for
the
state's
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance
to
be
displaced.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
i
think
first
of
all
you
go
to
the
core
of
the
business
of
insurance,
and
you
start
there,
and
the
core--
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
--well,
the
core
of
the
business
of
insurance
goes
to
the
issues
of
enforceability,
the
reliability,
and
i
think
also
the
suitability
of
an
insurance
contract,
so
if
you're
regulating
the
business
of
insurance,
you
are
regulating
the
policyholder's
protection
over
a
current
promise,
a
current
contract
for
a
future
promise.
that's
the
nature
of
in--
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
--yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
okay,
let's
basically
start
with
the
fundamentals
of
the
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance
and
the
insurer-policyholder
relationship.
the
insurer-policyholder
relationship
is
consummated
in
an
insurance
contract.
that
insurance
contract
needs
to
be
enforceable,
it
needs
to
be
reliable,
and
it
needs
to
be
fairly
and
suitably
entered
into.
the
individual
who
is
responsible
for
bringing
those
parties
together
and
creating
an
enforceable,
reliable,
and
suitable
insurance
contract
is
the
insurance
agent.
therefore,
i
think
the
first
question
is,
is
the
role
of
the
insurance
agent
in
that
insurance
transaction,
in
making
sure
you
have
an
enforceable,
reliable,
and
suitable
insurance
contract,
part
of
the
insurance
policy,
insurer-policyholder
relationship?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
definitely
is
yes.
the
question
then
becomes,
if
the
insurance
agent
is
an
integral
player
in
making
sure
that
the
insurer-policyholder
relationship
occurs,
then
if
the
florida
legislature
has
found
that
the
interjection
of
a
national
bank
into
the
role
of
the
agent
in
that
insurer-policyholder
relationship
creates
the
dangers
of
coercion,
unfair
trade
practices,
and
undue
concentration
of
resources,
whether
or
not
that
interjection
of
those
perils
into
the
insurer-policyholder
relationship
is
a
legitimate
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance.
there
may
be
issues
raised
by
the
petitioner
as
to
the
wisdom
of
whether
there
was
some
other
way
of
handling
those
perils,
but
if
you
look
at
the
michael
m.
case,
the
question
is
if
the
legislature
has
identified
a
particular
method
of
addressing
perils
with
regard
to
the
protection
of
policyholders,
then
normally
the
court
gives
great
deference
to
the
state's
judgment,
which
has
been
ratified
by
the
state
courts,
as
to
the
manner
in
which
that
particular
danger
will
be
addressed.
the
petitioner
repeatedly
asserts
that
the
dangers
that
have
been
asserted
are
disingenuous.
there
is
no
record
evidence,
other
than
the
preamble,
which
would
in
any
way
suggest
that
the
state
court
cases,
production
credit
and
glendale,
which
are
cited
on
pages
20
and
21
of
the
department
of
insurance
brief,
are
not
the
most
accurate
articulation
of
the
purposes
of
this
law,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
law
was
enacted
in
1974.
the
production
case
in
1978
indicated
on
page
20
that
the
legislature
has
found
in
florida
that
there
is
inherent
potential
for
abuse
in
banks
engaging
in
insurance
agent
activities.
in
1991
in
the
glendale
case
the
florida
appellate
court--
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
--okay,
if
you
want
to
talk
about...
i
think
one
of
the
issues
is,
why
is
there
a
prohibition
against
bank
holding
companies
and
not
all
banks
in
allowing
the
small
town
bank
to
sell
insurance
in
florida?
i
believe
that
goes
most
directly
to
the
issue
of
undue
concentration
of
resources.
the
argument
which
explains
that
particular
element
of
the
danger
is
that
if
a
bank
holding
company
is
entitled,
as
the
comptroller
has
allowed,
through
a
branch
in
a
small
town,
to
market
in
any
geographical
area,
then
that
bank
holding
company
can
concentrate
its
entire
marketing
force
into
that
one
location
and
essentially
use
it
as
a
venue
to
engage
in
the
insurance
business.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
that
in
the
legislature's
judgment
i
believe
there
was
a
sense
that
with
regard
to
credit
life
three
was
more
of
a
nexus
between
the
bank's
interest
in
protecting
loans
and
protecting
credit
than
there
was
in
the
sale
of
other
insurance.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
i
think
that
was
a
legislative
judgment,
but
again--
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
--oh,
i
think
it
is
at
odds.
if
you
look
at
the
department
of
insurance
brief
at
page
5,
in
the
record
there's
testimony
that
as
the
exception
to
626.988,
that
in
florida
the
credit
line
has
become
an
area
where
reverse
competition
has
occurred,
and
that
because
of
that
reverse
competition,
where
the
competition
is
not
for
purposes
of
gaining
customers
but
to
gain
market
share,
that
the
commission
levels
in
those
products
have
gone
to
as
much
as
80
percent.
so
it
very
well
may
be
that
the
credit
line,
by
the
record
testimony,
is
an
example
of
the
fact
that
perhaps
the
legislature
should
have
made
another
judgment
with
regard
to
that
particular
line
of
business.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
yes,
sir,
and
i
believe
that...
one
other
thing
i
would
want
to
point
out
is
one
of
the
dangers
which
is
identified
which
is
somewhat
overlooked,
and
which
has
been
found
in
florida,
is
the
issue
of
unfair
trade
practices.
one
of
the
issues
that's
very
important
is
that
with
the
sale
of
insurance
products,
that
there
is
the
peril
that
the
insurance-buying
person
will
become
deceived
as
to
what
is
a
bank
product
and
what
is
an
insurance
product,
so
i
think
that
more
than
just
the
problem
of
tying
it
to
a
loan,
there's
the
problem
of
in
essence
a
deception
in
consumers
being
misled.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
yes.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
i
don't
think
so,
because--
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
--that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
well,
i
think
that
as
long
as
mccarran-ferguson
requires
that
the
law
be
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance,
that
there
needs
to
be
an
inquiry
into
the
purpose,
and
the
purpose
has
to
flow
to
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance.
that
is,
the
insurer-policyholder
relationship.
you
need
to
be
consistent
with
that
term
of
art,
the
business
of
insurance,
and
that's
a
very
important
point
in
looking
at
the
clear
statement
rule,
because
there's
been
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
the
term,
specifically
relate.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
well,
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
your
keeping
the
big
banks
out
through
the
regulation
of
the
insurance
agent
and
their
association
with
the
bank
is
regulation,
whether
or
not
that,
in
looking
at
that
law,
that
there
is
a
relationship
there
where
that...
that
law
regulates,
that
is,
controls,
adjusts,
or
manages
the
business
of
insurance,
that
is
that
whether
it
adjusts
controls
or
manages
a
peril
to
the
insurer-policyholder
relationship.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
that's
a
district
court
of
appeal
case.
yes,
i
am.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
no,
ma'am,
there's
not.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
yes,
ma'am.
in
both
cases
the
supreme
court--
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
--district
court
of
appeal,
yes,
ma'am.
in
both
cases--
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
but
with...
again,
with
the
clear
statement
rule.
mr.
daniel
y.
sumner
yes,
ma'am,
absolutely.
if
you
look
at
the
michael
m.
case,
you
again
look
at
the
state's
justification
for
a
law
which
is
given
great
deference.
in
that
case,
the
court
mentioned
that
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
had
given
interpretation,
but
in
this
case
on
two
occasions
the
state
courts
have
looked
at
the
purpose
of
the
state
law
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
state
courts
ascertaining,
or
their
judgment
as
to
what
that
particular
state
law
means,
is
entitled
to
great
deference.
with
regard
to
the
clear
statement
rule,
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
remember
that
for
a
law,
federal
law
to
displace
or
preempt
a
state
law,
it
must
specifically
relate
to
the
business
of
insurance.
it
must
specifically
relate
to
the
insurer-policyholder
relationship.
therefore,
to
specifically
relate
to
the
business
of
insurance
with
regard
to
preemption
of
a
state
law
which
regulates
the
business
of
insurance,
i
would
submit
that
the
test
should
be
whether
or
not
the
federal
law
is
a
clear
statement
that
congress
intended
to
remove
the
policyholder
protection
afforded
by
the
state
law
and
replace
it
with
a
federal
law.
