ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
is
faced
today
with
what
is
truly
not
a
classic
first
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
riled
by
a
death
row
inmate
in
a
timely
fashion.
there
are
many
things
this
case
is,
but
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
not.
all
we
have
asked
the
court
in
this
case
to
do
is
to
apply
traditional
equitable
principles
in
existence
for
decades
to
what
is
clearly
an
inequitable
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
in
this
action.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
the
first
one
that
mr.
lonchar
actually
filed
himself,
yes,
sir.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
in
fact
we
discussed
that
issue
at
the
hearing
before
the
judge
in
1994.
that
was
a
question
that
came
up,
because
our
position
was
we
did
not
want
mr.
lonchar
to
be
able
to
do
exactly
what
he
had
done--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--to
change
his
mind
again.
we
asked
for
the
dismissal
with
prejudice.
after
we
researched
georgia
law
on
the
point,
it
appeared
that
georgia
law
was
at
best
unclear,
but
it
certainly...
the
civil
practice
act
seemed
to
allow
a
dismissal
without
prejudice.
the
court
at
the
hearing
made
it
clear
to
mr.
lonchar
that
she
felt
that
this
was
the
end
of
the
proceedings,
that
finality
as
far
as
state
court
was
concerned--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--the
order
definitely
was
without
prejudice.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
it
would
have
barred
the
claims.
the
problem
with
that
is--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--right.
there
were
numerous
claims
that
had
already
been
decided
on
direct
appeal
that
were
present
in
that
petition,
so
i'm
not...
i
don't
know
that
those
would
have
been
barred
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
because
they
have
been
decided
on
the
merits,
but
it
would
have
barred--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--the
remainder
of
the
claims.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not,
and
we--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--because
of
the
late
filing
itself.
it
was
the
timing
of
the
petition
and
the
time
at
which
we
received
it,
and
simply
did
not
have
the
time
to
get
a
response
filed,
to
get
the
petition
dismissed,
and
to
make
further
inquiry
into
the
entire
prejudice,
and
i
would
point
out
a
second
aspect--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
seven-day
period,
actually.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
his
petition
was
filed
on
the...
initially
in
state
court
on
the
day
we
had
an
execution
scheduled.
it
was
temporarily
stayed
over
the
weekend,
and
then
the
federal
petition
was
then
filed,
i
believe,
2
days
before
the
end
of
that
period
that
had
occurred,
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
and
during
that
time
we
were
engaged
in
looking
at
the
first
question
of
whether
the
state
court
was
going
to
even
consider
the
merits
of
the
claim,
because
the
state
court
was
concerned
with
timeliness
as
well.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
we...
what
i
pled
in
the
answer,
in
the
motion
in
the
district
court
was
that
we
were
not
waiving
9(a),
but
we
did
not
have
information
on
the
merits
of
the
claims
at
that
point
in
time...
things
such
as
the
competency
to
stand
trial
claim,
and
the
ineffective
assistance
of
claims
due
to
the
timeliness
of
the
proceedings
involved,
yes.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
that
was
clearly
pled
in
our
pleadings
with
the
district
court
that
we
were
saying
we
don't
have
time...
because
of
the
circumstances
there's
no
way
we
can
make
a
representation
about
prejudice
one
way
or
the
other.
and
now
we'll
get
back
to
a
secondary
point
on
that,
is
that
obviously
on
certain
claims
there
was
no
prejudice
because
they
had
already
been
litigated
on
the
merits,
and
that
was
the
secondary
problem
we
had
with
pleading
delay
as
a
general
principle
and
pleading
9(a)
as
a
general
principle,
and
i
didn't
want
to
misrepresent
to
the
court
that
we
couldn't
respond
to
all
of
the
claims
because
i
think
we
probably
could
have,
although
how
quickly
and
how
thoroughly
i
could
have
done
so
would
have
been
a
different
matter.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
think
we
did
plead
delay,
and
we
did
plead
9(a).
what
we
acknowledged
at
the
time
of
filing
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
was
that
based
upon
the
time
factor
we
could
not
make
the
particularized
showing--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i
submit
to
you
that
this
is
not
a
new
ground.
we're
not
asking
the
court--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--i'll
agree
with
you
on
that,
your
honor.
i
can
find
no
factual
scenario
out
there
like
this
anywhere.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
what
we
would
submit
is
what
the
district
courts
have
the
discretion
to
do
is
to
examine
new
issues
as
they
arise,
new
factual
and
procedural
scenarios
as
they
come
up
under
long-established
equitable
principles.
we're
asking
that
this
court
allow
the
district
court
to
utilize
what
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
the
district
court
can
do,
and
that
is,
look
at
equity.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
certainly.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
i
think
that's
a
general
statement,
but
i
don't
think
barefoot
went
so
far
as
to
say
we're
never
going
to
look
at
equitable
principles
on
habeas
corpus.
the
history
of
this
court's
habeas
jurisprudence
has
been
to
examine
equitable
factors
consistently.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
if
we
had
had
the
6
years
where
nothing
had
happened,
and
i
presume
that
is
the
hypothetical
you're
proposing,
i
think
our
argument
certainly
becomes
much
harder
because
then
you're
a
lot
closer
to
what
9(a)
is
designed
to
deal
with,
a
true
laches
situation
where
nothing
has
happened
except
delay.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
should
be
a
way
for
the
district
court
to
take
that
into
consideration.
however--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--no,
your
honor,
we
have
not
taken
that
position
in
our
brief
primarily
because
we
don't
need
to
take
that
position.
we
don't
need
for
the
court
to
take
that
step
in
this
case
because
that's
simply
not
what
we
have.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no.
we're
not
trying
to
shoehorn
it
deliberately
into
rule
9(a).
i
think
there's
certainly
some
suggestion
that
it
could
be,
but
what
we're
simply
going
back
to
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
examine
everything
that
took
place
in
this
case...
that
is,
it's
not
a
true
first
federal
habeas
petition
filed
by
mr.--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i
think
our
two
strongest
positions
are
that
particular
fact,
and
encompassed
in
that
involves
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
situation
where
larry
lonchar
was
unaware
of
anything
that
was
going
on.
we
have
an
individual
determined
to
be
competent
by
four
courts,
was
brought
into
court
consistently
given
consistent
opportunities
to
participate.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no,
your
honor.
no.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
in
that
case
you'd
have
to
say
that
the
delay
at
least
is
in
large
part
attributable
to
the
state,
as
opposed--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
again,
i
don't
think...
it's
certainly
not
the
same
case
that
we
have
here.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
he's
not
responsible
per
se
for
the
next
friend
petitions.
what
he's
responsible
for
is
not
participating
in
and
not
filing
petitions
when
he
had
ample
opportunity
to
do
so.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
the
difference
in
that
case
is
because
again
you
get
back
to,
that
becomes
our
fault.
that
becomes
our
fault
that
it's
a
last
minute
proceeding
because
we
haven't
taken
the
action
that
the
state
should
have
taken,
and
either
gone
ahead
and
gotten
some
litigation
to
proceed
and
determine
that
he
was
competent,
or
taken
some
action
to
get
an
execution
date
set
to
move
the
case
along.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
i
would
have
some
problems
with
it.
the
problem
with...
first
of
all,
under
state
law,
he
can
do
that.
under
georgia
law
he
can
do
that.
we
would
not
have
any
way
to
bar
him
from
doing
that
at
this
point,
so
i
would
be
precluded
from
making
much
of
an
argument
in
state
court,
and
we
would
have
a
state
petition
filed.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
i
don't
think
it
is,
and
again,
what
we're
saying
in
this
case
is
there
is
much
more
involved
than
just--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i
think
we're
doing
a
little
bit
more
than
that,
and
actually
i'm
not
blaming
or
crediting
larry
lonchar
for
the
actions
of
his
brother
and
sister.
what
i
am
giving
him
responsibility
for
is
for
being
in
open
court
on
numerous
occasions
and
having
the
opportunity
to
raise
the
exact
claims
he's
raised
here.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
well,
your
honor,
if
he's
in
court
repeatedly
denying
the
opportunity
to
do
so,
that
might
present
a
somewhat
different
situation,
but
i
think
what
we're
focusing
on
is
his
opportunity
to
participate
in
litigation,
his
opportunity
to
raise
the
identical
claims...
the
only
claim
raised
in
this
petition
that's
new
is
the
method
of
execution
claim.
everything
else
has
been
presented
in
one
of
these
prior
petitions,
if
not
more
than
one.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i
think
under
the
circumstances
that
we
have
here,
i
think
you
have
to
attribute
those
proceedings
to
him
at
least
to
the
extent
of,
he's
had
his
chance.
he's
had
his
opportunity
for
access.
he's
had
the
opportunity--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--certainly.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
pulled
into
court
and
given
ample
opportunity
to
adopt
the
same
claims
that
he
is
now
seeking
to
raise.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
and
i
think,
your
honor--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--certainly.
certainly.
he
was
free
to
take
the
position
and
free
to
pursue
what
he
still
says
he
wants
to
do,
and
i
think
that
becomes
our
second...
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier,
our
second
most
important
factor
in
this
case
is
what
mr.
lonchar
is
trying
to
do,
and
what
he
says
he
is
trying
to
do,
and
what
both
the
state
court
and
the
district
court
found
as
fact
he
is
trying
to
do.
he
adopted,
and
i
use
the
word
very
loosely,
the
allegations
of
these
petitions
because
he's
decided
that
was
the
only
way
he
could
try
to
have
the
method
of
execution
changed
in
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
lonchar
has
never
said
he
wants
his
death
sentence
reversed.
he
has
never
said
he
wants
a
new
trial.
he
has
never
said
anything
but,
i
want
to
be
executed.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
what
he--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--what
he
is
saying,
and
i
think
this
gets
back
to
what...
if
you
look
at
what
he
says
in
these
proceedings,
he
wants
the
opportunity
to
donate
his
organs.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
to
make
some
meaningful
contribution
to
society.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the
claim
he's
making.
i
think
the
reading--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--that's
exactly
what
the
state
court
did
in
the
first
fashion
and
said
he's
not
seeking
relief.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
and
we
moved
to
dismiss.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
exactly
what
we
did.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
if
you
looked
at
the
face
of
the
pleadings
alone,
yes,
i
think
you
would
have
to
assume
that.
if
you
looked
at
what
mr.
lonchar--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--i
think
if
you
look
at
what
he
said
in
open
court,
both
before
the
state
court
and
before
the
district
court
in
june
of
this
year,
that's
not
what
he's
trying
to
do.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
what
he
actually
said
was,
i've
been
told
that
the
only
way
i
can
get
this
accomplished,
to
change
the
method
of
execution,
is
to
file
this
petition.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
that's
exactly...
and
the
district
court--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--the
desire
simply
to
wait.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
and
that's
not--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--if
he's
raising
a
substantive
claim
for
habeas
corpus
relief,
which
we
submit
he's
not
doing.
what
he's
seeking--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
wrapped
up
in
what
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
was.
i
believe--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--that
was
the
fundamental
premise,
but
i
believe
they
also
focused,
as
did
the
district
court,
on
what
he
was
trying
to
do.
the
district
court's
opinion
itself,
and
it's
discussed--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--i
think
that's
fair
to
say.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
in
that
technical
sense,
when
we
look
at
the
entire
petition--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--certainly.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
if
mr.
lonchar
were
saying
that
i
want
my
conviction
and
sentence
reversed,
and
in
that
time
period
we're
going
to
do
what
we
can
about
the
method
of
execution,
then
that
does
undercut
that
aspect
of
our
argument,
but
that's
not
what
he's
doing
in
this
case.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
petition
has
claims
in
it
which
are
not
subject
to
dismissal,
mr.
lonchar's
stated
intent,
and
the
relief
he
seeks,
he
does
not
seek
to
have
his
conviction
and
sentence
reversed.
that's
not
the
relief
he's
seeking.
we're
back
to
the
point--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--it...
there's
two
different
issues,
and
that's
a
different
one,
yes,
but
it's
certainly
an
issue.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
if
you
get
past
that...
if
you
take
that
assumption,
and
you
go
past
that
point,
then
what
he
wants
to
do
with
his
life
is
not
necessarily
the
factor
any
more.
then
we're
back
to
looking
at
equitable
principles.
we're
looking
at
what
has
gone
on
over
the
past
6
years
in
this
case
to
determine...
we're
back
to
looking
at
equity,
and
why
equity
allows
the
district
court--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--alone.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
i'm
not,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
i
think
that's
absolutely
our
point.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
that
equitable
principles...
and
again,
we
get
back
to
separating
one
at
a
time.
if
you
look
strictly
at
motivation
in
your
hypothetical,
then
no,
that
alone
does
not
figure
into
it.
but
can
you
factor
all
of
these
aspects
together?
can
you
factor
into
the
equation
in
this
case
his
stated
purpose,
the
stated
relief
he
seeks,
his
failure
to
participate
in
the
next
friend
actions,
factor
all
of
these
things
together--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--i
think
it
certainly
matters,
your
honor,
when
what
he
says
is,
i'm
not
interested
in
getting
my
death
sentence
or
my
conviction
reversed.
i
want
to
be
executed.
and
what
he
specifically
said
was,
i'd
be
happy
to
be
executed
this
afternoon.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
there's
certainly
a
concern
about
the
evenhanded
distribution
of
justice,
if
you
will.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
rules
are
certainly
fundamentally
important,
your
honor.
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
we
have
a
scenario
never
envisioned
by
congress,
on
which
congress
simply
has
never
had
the
occasion
to
need
to
enact
a
rule.
this
court
in
its
history
has
never
felt
constrained
to
refuse
to
look
at
an
equitable
principle
simply
because
congress
has
not
acted.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
in
its
abuse-of-the-writ
cases
that...
we're
not
saying
it's
limited
to
any
specific
little
litany
of
factors.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
for
9(b),
it
does.
9(b)
specifies
successive
petitions,
that's
correct,
but
there
are
other--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
one
of
the
reasons
that
we're
not
asking
for
a
new
rule
is
because
i
think
the
old
rules
of
equity
apply
to
this
case.
that's
the
problem
with--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--i
can't--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--no.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
if
we
were
asking
the
court
to
do
just
that
and
to
engage
in
an
entire
new
line
of
lawmaking
or
decisionmaking,
then
i
think
this
case
presents
certain
factual
problems
that
make
it
more
difficult
to
engage
in
general
rulemaking,
because
it's
not
the
general
case,
but
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
go
off
making
new
broad-ranging
rules
because
we
don't...
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
we
simply
don't
need
them.
yes,
this
case
presents
a
classic
example
of
we
got
two
different
last
minute
petitions
being
filed,
two
different
stays
of
executions
at
the
very
last
minute,
which
could
have
come
up
certainly
much
earlier
in
the
proceedings.
it
does
lend
itself
to
that
analysis.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
thank
you,
your
honor.
