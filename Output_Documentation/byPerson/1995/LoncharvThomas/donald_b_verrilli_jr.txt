mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
standards
that
govern
a
federal
court's
decision
whether
to
entertain
a
first
federal
habeas
corpus
petition.
the
issue
arises
in
an
anomalous
factual
context.
the
record
is
clear
that
petitioner
larry
lonchar,
though
found
competent,
is
a
deeply
disturbed
person
with
suicidal
impulses.
that
mental
illness
led
him
to
resist
efforts
by
his
siblings
to
challenge
his
conviction
and
death
sentence
in
next
friend
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
he
has
not
been
entirely
consistent,
however.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
not
in
every
instance,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
in
this
instance,
yes.
his
mental
illness
is
one
that
produces
and
has
been
documented
as
producing
serious
suicidal
impulses
and
that,
we
think,
is
the
principal
reason,
and
the
record
shows
it's
the
principal
reason
that
it's
led
to
his
resistance
of
those
efforts.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
there
is
a
factual
finding
to
that
effect--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
justice
o'connor.
in
our--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--in
our
view,
justice
o'connor,
the
record
shows
that
the
district
court
found
both
that
lonchar
seeks,
genuinely
seeks
to
pursue
these
claims,
and
that
his
motive
for
doing
so
is
solely
to
achieve
delay.
in
our
view,
those
are
irreconcilable.
however,
it
should
not
matter
as
a
matter
of
law,
even
if
the
court
does
take
the
case
with
that
finding
unchanged,
because
our
position
is
that
lonchar's
motivation,
subjective
motivation
for
filing
a
first
federal
habeas
petition
should
be
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
should
not
be
the
subject
of
inquiry
in
this
case,
as
it
is
not
in
civil
litigation
generally.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
do,
justice
o'connor,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
there
are
two
separate
issues
woven
together
there,
and
if
you'll
permit
me--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--let
me
to
try
to
separate
them.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
first
is
the
passage
of
time
up
to
the
point
in
june
of
1995
when
lonchar's
federal
habeas
petition,
the
petition
at
issue
here,
was
filed.
our
view
about
that
is
that
rule
9(a)
governs
the
analysis
of
that
issue.
there's
a
second
issue
here
about
lonchar's
subjective
motive
for
filing
as
of
june
1995.
our
position
there
is
that
subjective
motive
should
not
be
a
subject
of
inquiry.
if
it's
a
substantial
petition,
an
objectively
substantial
petition,
then
it
ought
to
be
treated
just
like
a
petition
for
relief
in
any
other
kind
of
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
your
honor,
that's
a
serious
question
here.
i
understand
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
if
there
are
substantial
claims
on
the
merits,
and
it's
a
first
petition,
that
they
must
be
adjudicated.
the
only
reason
that
motive
was
injected
into
the
inquiry
here
was
because
the
district
judge
put
mr.
lonchar
on
the
stand
and
asked
him
what
his
motives
were.
our
view
is,
that's
not
a
proper
subject
of
inquiry.
if
there's
a
verification
on
record,
as
there
was
on
this
case,
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury
pursuant
to
habeas
rule
2,
that
the
petitioner
genuinely
wishes
to
pursue
the
claim
for
relief,
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
very
definitely,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
right
in
the
habeas
rules.
if
there's
no
substantial
claim
for
relief,
the
petition
may
be
dismissed
on
its
face,
but
here
there
are
very
substantial
claims
for
relief,
and
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
and
when
substantial
claim
for
relief
is
alleged,
as
it
was
here,
this
case,
a
first
federal
habeas
petition,
should
be
treated
just
like
an
antitrust
case,
a
labor
case,
a
civil
case
generally
under
rule
11,
and
pursued
on
the
merits.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
there
may
be
a
very,
very
limited
and
narrowly
circumscribed
discretion
to
do
so,
your
honor.
it
is
not
our
position
that
rule
9(a)
and
rule
9(b)
codify
and
thereby
exhausts
completely
the
limits
of
a
court's
discretion.
however,
that
discretion
in
our
view
must
be
very
narrowly
circumscribed.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there...
the
traditional
equitable
doctrine
of
unclean
hands
is
the
only
additional
equitable
principle
that
i
think
is
not
already
encompassed
within
9(a)
that
might
be
brought
to
bear
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
our
view,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
it
is
definitely
an
exclusive
statement
of
the
doctrine
of
laches.
it
codified
the
common
law
doctrine
of
laches
as
it
applied
to
habeas.
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
and
most
recently
in
the
brecht
v.
abrahamson
case
that
in
habeas
the
only
laches
recognized
are
those
which
prejudice
the
state's
ability
to
defend
the
petition.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
justice
souter,
and
that's
why,
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg,
i
indicated
that
i
thought
there
was
some
narrow
room
for
the
traditional
equitable
principle
of
unclean
hands
to
operate
even
beyond
9(a).
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
because,
justice
souter,
laches
is
about
delay
and
the
consequences
of
delay.
bad
faith
seems
to
me
to
be
a
separate
inquiry.
bad
faith--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
indeed,
that
is
precisely
the
holding
of
this
court
in
1986
in
vasquez
v.
hillery.
that
was
exactly
the
issue,
whether
that
kind
of
prejudice
could
be
recognized
and
held
against
a
petitioner
in
habeas.
the
holding
of
the
court
in
vasquez
was
that
it
could
not,
that
congress
recognized
only
laches
in
the
sense
of
difficulty
in
defending
the
petition,
that
different
kind
of
prejudice
was
not
cognizable
in
laches
as
applied
in
habeas.
that
was
the
specific
holding
of
that
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
justice
souter,
you've
put
it
beautifully.
that
is
exactly
our
argument,
that
the
delay
that
is
at
issue
with
respect
to
the
period
from
june
'95
forward
has
to
be
analyzed
as
a
question
of
whether
it's
unwarranted
delay,
whether
it's
delay
that
would
not
normally
have
occurred
in
the
normal
course
of
adjudicating
a
substantial
petition,
raising
substantial
claims
with
a
petitioner
who
has
a
good
faith
belief
in
the
substantiality
of
his
claim,
and
that's
what
we
have--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
precisely
right,
justice
souter.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if
one
reads
them
as
i
understood
justice
o'connor
to
have
been
reading
them
i
think
they
are
contradictory,
but
what
i
tried
to
suggest
is
that
the
two
can
coexist
in
the
sense
that,
as
the
facts
here
show,
a
person
can
have
a
substantial
claim,
can
have
a
good
faith
belief
in
the
substantiality
of
the
claim,
and
can
nonetheless
be
pursuing
it
for
purposes
that
are
other
than
the
purpose
of
achieving
substantive
relief,
and
that's
why
we
think
there
just
shouldn't
be
an
inquiry
on
a
substantial
first
federal
habeas
petition
into
that
issue.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
tort
of
abuse
of
process.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
are
significant
differences
here.
as
your
honor
described
that
abuse
of
process
tort
in
the
hecht
case
two
terms
ago,
it
applies
in
a
very
narrow
circumstance,
not
just
when
a
civil
case
is
filed
for
purposes
of
harassment,
but
only
when
there
is
the
equivalent
of
what
would
i
think
in
the
equity
context
be
considered
bad
faith,
or
unclean
hands.
it's
got
to
be
a
very
serious
effort
to
achieve
coercion
or
extortion
through
use
of
the
civil
process.
and
i
would
also
note,
your
honor,
that
with
respect
to
abuse
of
process,
although
there
is
a
separate
tort
for
damages,
it's...
the
finding
of
abuse
of
process
does
not
forfeit
the
valid
substantive
claim.
that
claim
continues
to
go
forward
on
the
merits.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
do
not,
your
honor.
first,
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
plead
rule
9(a)
and
to
advance
it
as
a
reason
for
dismissal.
they
did
not
do
so.
the
state
did
preserve
rule
9(a)
for
future
litigation
in
this
case,
but
they
very
clearly
and
distinctly
did
not
advance
it
as
a
reason
for
dismissal.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
come
under
rule
9(a)
anyway.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
is,
but
there
is
a
threshold
point
here
of
some
importance.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
the
timing
of
the
filing
of
a
petition
can
be
considered.
however,
the
only
circumstance
in
which
this
court
has
indicated
that
it
has
decisive
weight,
or
very
substantial
weight,
is
in
the
context
of
a
subsequent
petition.
the
case
that
comes
to
mind
is
this
court's
gomez
case,
which
was
mr.
harris'
case,
and
it
was
a
section
1983
action
after
four
petitions
had
been
filed.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
not
the
kind
of
prejudice
that
we
think
rule
9
addresses,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
with
respect
to
a
second
federal
habeas,
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
the
rules
are
quite
different
there.
the
presumption
in
that
context
is
strongly
against
review,
because
of
the
various
doctrines
that
this
court
has
announced
as
a
matter
of
the
equitable
nature
of
this
remedy
over
the
years,
and
as
a
general
matter.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
rule
is
clear,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
has
been
clear
for
years,
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
plead
abuse.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
justice
scalia--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that
is
the
crux
of
the
case,
justice
scalia,
but
i
think
this
court
cannot
do
so,
and
there
are
three
reasons
for
that.
the
first
is
that,
as
a
matter
of
the
statute
and
rule
9(b),
there
is
a
requirement
of
a
prior
determination
on
the
merits
of
the
claims.
thus,
as
a
statutory
matter,
the
condition
for
treating
this
as
a
subsequent
petition
simply
isn't
satisfied.
second,
there
is
no--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
but
i
took
it
that
your
honor
was
asking
me
why
shouldn't
the
court
treat
this
as
though
it
were
a
successive
petition,
and
i'm
trying
to
suggest--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
court
has
to
consider
it
a
first
petition
because
it
is.
9(a)
imposes
a
requirement
of
unjustified
delay
as
a
trigger
to
this
laches
analysis,
and
that...
if
the
court
is
to
analyze
the
case--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--certainly.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
certainly,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
certainly
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
anything
to
the
contrary.
9(a)
would
apply,
but
the
question
would
be
whether
there
were
unjustified...
there
was
unjustified
delay
here,
given
the
prior
next
friend
proceedings.
the
question
would
require,
it
seems
to
me,
an
inquiry
into
those
next
friend
proceedings
then,
because
if
delay
is
unjustified
under
rule
9(a)
it's
got
to
be
in
some
sense
attributable
to
the
petitioner.
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
right,
justice
souter,
but
in
terms
of
whether
those
prior
proceedings
created
an
unjustified
delay,
i
think
we
have
to
look
into
whether...
we
have
to
look
into
the
way
those--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
correct
if
there
were
some
obligation
on
his
part
to
do
so,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
justice
souter,
nothing
precluded
him
from
doing
that.
he
resisted
those
petitions
because
he
wanted
to
die.
he
changed
his
mind
at
a
later
time,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
on
habeas.
i
take
it
that's
an
intentional
decision
by
congress
that
petitions
can
be
brought
at
several
years
after
the
conviction
becomes
final.
the
constraint
on
delay
is
the
constraint
of
laches
imposed
by
rule
9(a),
which
is
laches,
that
delay
that
prejudices
the
other
party's
ability--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
but
the
context
of
gomez
is
quite
different
here.
that
was
the
harris
case,
where
there
had
been
four
adjudications,
habeas
petitions
adjudicated
on
the
merits,
and
what
i
take
to
be
the
gist
of
that
statement--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--your
honor,
as
i
read
that
opinion,
what
it
seemed
to
be
saying
is
that
precisely
because
there
had
been
four
prior
opportunities
to
raise
that
claim
in
federal
habeas
in
the
normal
course
of
events
and
it
was
not
raised,
that
this
section
1983
action
in
gomez
ought
to
be
considered
and
truly
was
an
end
round,
a
run...
an
end
run
around
the
abuse
of
the
writ
principles
that
would
normally
have
foreclosed
consideration
of
that,
and
that
section
1983
ought
not
to
be
used
in
that
manner.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
that's
where
the
law
is,
justice
scalia--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
where
it's
been
since
barefoot
v.
estelle,
that
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
and
particularly...
and
the
circumstances
of
this
case
are
somewhat
anomalous
in
that
respect
because
actually
because
of
the
next
friend
proceedings
the
state
has
known
since
1991
in
this
case
what
the
claims
are,
and
therefore
that
sort
of
surprise
issue,
though
it
might
be
present
in
another
record,
actually
isn't
present
on
this
record.
there's
also
something
about
the
way
in
which
georgia's
procedure
works
with
death
penalties
that
makes
that
a
more
difficult
issue
as
well,
and
that
there's
this
week-long
period
in
which
the
execution
can
occur,
which
i
gather
is
established
precisely
to
avoid
this
problem,
so
that
even
if
the
petition
is
filed
shortly
before--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
a
limited
stay
is
in
order--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--in
those
circumstances--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
a
limited
stay
in
situations
where
that
inquiry
can't
be
done
simply
on
the
face
of
the
papers
in
short
order,
which
i
imagine--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it's
the
result
of
a
system
in
which
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
the
facts
would
support
that
result
here,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
even
in
another
case,
it
seems
to
me
a
very
short
stay
would
be
in
order
in
those
circumstances
simply
to
permit
the
evaluation
of
whether
there
are
substantial
federal
claims
in
the
petition,
and
that's--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there
may
be
circumstances,
extreme
circumstances--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--extreme
circumstances
like
those
circumstances
in
which
there
is
proof
of
bad
faith.
in
that
case,
the
equitable
doctrine,
the
traditional
equitable
doctrine
of
unclean
hands
narrowly
confined
within
its
traditional
bounds
may
apply
and
give--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--absent
a
finding
of
bad
faith
and
unclean
hands,
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
basis
for
denying
a
stay
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
very
definitely,
justice
breyer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
my
communications
with
this
client
have
left
me
with
no
doubt
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we're
prepared
to
submit.
