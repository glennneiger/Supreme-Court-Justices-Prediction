unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
one
would
have
to
be
mentally
ill
in
order
to
resist
efforts
to
challenge
the
appeal,
to
appeal
your
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
verrilli,
do
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption,
as
the...
i
guess
it's
the
eleventh
circuit
found,
that
the
petitioner
is
seeking
federal
habeas
for
purposes
of
delaying
his
execution
and
not
to
vindicate
any
constitutional
right
he
might
have?
unknown
speaker
to
that
effect.
unknown
speaker
and
so
do
we
take
the
case
on
that
assumption?
unknown
speaker
and
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose,
though,
that
you
do
acknowledge
that
habeas
is
an
equitable
remedy.
unknown
speaker
and
are
we
limited
to
what
rule
9
provides
in
that
regard
as
to
delay
in
filing,
or
could
conceivably
equitable
considerations
allow
a
federal
court
to
deny
even
a
first
federal
habeas?
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
fine.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
verrilli,
what
if
the
motive
is,
you
know,
to
really
make
a
laughing
stock
out
of
the
federal
courts.
unknown
speaker
well,
take
it
just
as
a
hypothetical,
not
necessarily
this
case,
but
you're
saying
motive
is
immaterial.
what
if
a
first
habeas
petitioner
says,
i
think
i've
got
some
good
claims
here,
but
i
really
don't
care
what
the
court
does,
i
really
just
want
to
make
fools
of
these
judges.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
petition
on
its
face
shows
that
it's
frivolous
and/or
malicious,
it
could
be
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think--
--mr.
verrilli--
--do
you
think
that
there's
any
ground,
other
than
what's
stated
in
9(a)
and
(b)...
let's
assume
there's
no
prejudice
to
the
state
in
that
it
can
answer
the
petition,
and
that
it's
a
first
federal
habeas,
do
you
see
any
room
at
all
or
a
federal
court
to
dismiss
the
petition
outside
of
the
specifications
of
9(a)
and
(b)?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
a
concrete
example--
unknown
speaker
--of
what
such
a
case
would
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
9(a)
an
exclusive
statement
of
the
doctrine
of
laches?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
take
that
so
far
as
to
cover
a
case
in
which
the
prisoner
in
effect
requested
various
next
friends
to
file
next
friend
petitions
in
bad
faith,
knowing
perfectly
well
that
he
was
competent,
and
to
do
so
solely
for
the
repeatedly
delaying
the
execution
date?
would
you
say
that
rule
9(a)...
and
in
each
case,
the
state's
capacity
to
defend
on
the
merits,
if
any
of
these
requests
for
relief
reached
the
merit
stage,
would
not
in
any
way
be
compromised.
would
you
say,
in
a
case
like
that,
that
rule
9(a)
precluded
an
equitable
consideration
of
that
bad
faith
that
he
had
participated
in?
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
consistent
with
your...
maybe
i
didn't
understand
what
you
said.
how
is
that
consistent
with
your
answer
that
9(a)
exhausts
the
concept
of
laches?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
the
state
were
to
show
that
the
evidence
were
stale,
and
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
the
state
to
prevail
on
retrial.
that's
beyond
the
wording
of
9(a)
as
i
understand
9(a),
because
9(a)
talks
about
the
ability
to
respond
to
the
petition.
let's
assume
the
state
can
completely
respond
to
the
petition
on,
say,
ineffectiveness
of
counsel,
but
that
the
evidence
will
be
very,
very
stale,
and
the
state
will
have
a
much
more
difficult
time
prevailing.
that's
not
part
of
laches?
unknown
speaker
mr.
verrilli,
may
i
go
back
to
the
earlier
point
about
the
finding
that
he
had
taken
the
action
he
had
solely
for
purposes
of
delay.
i
don't
want
to
argue
your
case
for
you,
but
it
seems
to
me
there's
another
point
to
be
made.
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
usually
when
we
talk
about
or
when
we
condemn
an
application
as
being
made
solely
for
delay,
the
implication
is
that
it
really
is
not
made
with
a
belief
in
the
merits
asserted,
that
it
is
either
in
bad
faith
or
it's
on
the
verge
of
bad
faith,
and
that
it's
explicable
only
as
a
device
to
postpone
an
execution.
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
finding
of
delay
was
made
on
the
understanding
that
he
wanted
to
preserve
his
life
long
enough
to
see
a
change
in
the
method
of
execution
so
that
he
could
donate
his
vital
organs
to...
i
don't
know,
to
science,
or
an
organ
bank,
or
something
or
other.
that
isn't
delay
in
sort
of
the
classic
sense
that
has
been
condemned,
is
it?
in
other
words,
a
person...
if
i
want
to
preserve
my
life,
i
can
then
give
it
away,
or
throw
it
away,
or
do
anything
i
want
to
with
it
if
i
succeed,
and
that's
what
your
client
wants
to
do,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
can
that
in
terms
of
our
usual
terminology
there
really
isn't
any
contradiction
between
the
two
findings
that
you've
pointed
out
of
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
verrilli,
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
said
they
were
inherently
contradictory.
unknown
speaker
it's
strange
that
that
shouldn't
be
considered
by
an
equity
court
when
even
in
civil
law,
if
you
pursue
a
right
that
is
a
genuine
right,
but
you
pursue
it
solely
for
the
purpose
of
harassment,
that's
actionable.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
clear
that
rule
9
itself
doesn't
cover
this
case?
don't
you
think
the
state's
ability
to
respond
is
affected
if
this
habeas
petition
is
dumped
upon
the
state
at
the
eleventh
hour
when
it
is
clear
that
the
state
cannot
respond
in
time
to
go
ahead
with
the
scheduled
execution?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
and
you
think
that
a
court
of
equity
cannot
even
take
into
account
the
fact
that
this
would
have
come
under
9(a)
anyway
in
deciding
whether
the
court
of
equity
could
decide
that
habeas
corpus
won't
lie?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
different
argument
from
the
one--
unknown
speaker
--you
were
just
making.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
whether
a
court
can
consider
whether,
had
9(a)
been
alleged,
that
wouldn't
have
sufficed
anyway.
unknown
speaker
so
you'd
say,
even
with
a
later
petition
if
the
petition
comes
in,
you
know,
2
minutes
before
the
execution
and
the
state
is
supposed
to
respond
and
a
court
consider
the
state's
response
and
rule
on
the
matter
within
those
2
minutes,
that
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
rule
9?
unknown
speaker
well,
rule
9
is...
it
must
be
a
very
poorly
drawn
rule,
then.
you
say
that
if
the
petitioner
comes
in,
say
even
with
a
second
federal
habeas,
5
minutes
before
the
execution
is
scheduled,
he's
entitled
to
have
a
complete
consideration
on
the
merits
even
though
the
district
judge
cannot
immediately
digest
any
part
of
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
state
has
to
plead
abuse
in
a
second
federal
habeas,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it
just
doesn't
automatically
get
pleaded.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
this
were...
so
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
we
should
consider
as
effectively
a
second
habeas
what
is
technically
a
first
habeas
that's
been
filed
after
the
proceeding
has
been
delayed
numerous
times,
not
by
this
petitioner
but
by
people
related
to
this
petitioner,
seeking
to
proceed
as
next
friends.
why
shouldn't
i
consider
that
the
same
thing
as
a
second
habeas
for
purposes
of
whether
rule
9
applies--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
way
i've
just
suggested?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
why
do
you
say...
what
about
delayed
petitions,
9(a)?
i'm
talking
about
9(a),
not
9(b).
there's
no
requirement
that
it
be
a
second
or
successive
petition.
9(a)
relates
to
a
delayed
petition.
it
says
it
may
be
dismissed
if
it
appears
that
the
state
has
been
prejudiced
in
its
ability
to
respond.
unknown
speaker
for
purposes
of
whether
9(a)
is
applicable,
not
9(b).
for
purposes
of
whether
the
state
has
been
prejudiced
in
its
ability
to
respond.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
we
shouldn't
apply
9(a)
strictly
to
the
first
petition,
and
granting
that,
although
9(a)
doesn't
say
anything
like
that,
but
even
if
that
is
true,
why
should
i
consider
this
to
be
the
first
petition
for
that
purpose
when
in
fact
there
have
been
several
others
filed
on
this
prisoner's
behalf?
unknown
speaker
mr.
verrilli,
9(a)
could
be
applicable
to
a
first
petition,
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
if
there
had
been
delay,
and
as
a
result
the
prosecutor
was
unable
to
answer
a
point
that
he
might
have
answered
earlier.
unknown
speaker
so
9(a),
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
the
first
or
the
tenth,
9(a)
could
apply.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
could
happen
in
either
of
two
ways.
i
take
it
there's
no
indication
here
that
he
had
requested
or
encouraged
the
next
friend
petitions.
i
guess
that's...
in
your
favor.
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
the
fact
that
those
next
friend
petitions
were
pending,
or
there
were
proceedings
on
them,
didn't
bar
him
from
coming
in
with
his
own
petition.
all
he
had
to
do
was
walk
in
and
say,
here's
my
petition.
i'm
competent.
nothing
stopped
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
prepared...
i
think
what
i
meant
to
suggest
by
my
two
questions
is,
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
to
the
extent
those
prior
next
friend
proceedings
dragged
things
out,
i
guess
there's
no
evidence
that
would
support
the
argument
that
we
should
attribute
them
to
him
as
opposed
to
the
next
friends,
but
i'm
also
suggesting
that
those
next
friend
petitions
really
don't
necessarily
explain
the
delay,
because
there
could
have
been
10
next
friend
petitions
going
on,
and
he
could
still
have
walked
in
with
his
own
petition
at
any
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
is
why...
that's...
i
guess
that's
the
question.
was
there
an
obligation,
since
we
have
a
rule
against
delay,
and
my
suggestion
is
that
nothing
precluded
him
from
coming
in
earlier,
including
the
next
friend
petitions.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there's
no
obligation
to
come
forward
at
any
time,
then
the
provision
of
delay
in
9(a)
really
doesn't
mean
much.
i
mean,
if
in
order
to
trigger
any
inquiry
into
delay
you
have
to
find
that
there
was
some
sort
of
a
statutory
obligation
on
the
petitioner
to
come
in
and
bring
his
petition,
then
9(a)
really
doesn't
mean
much.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying,
then,
that
our
more
recent
decision
in
gomez...
there's
hillery
and
vasquez,
which
you
rely
on.
then
in
gomez
we
said
that
a
court
may
consider
the
last
minute
nature
of
an
application
to
stay
execution
in
deciding
whether
to
grant
equitable
relief.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
preceded
by
a
sentence
that
says
the
claim
could
have
been
brought
more
than
10
years
ago.
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
geared
to
successive...
you're
quite
correct
there
were
successive
petitions
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
verrilli,
it
is
your
position,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
a
condemned
prisoner
can
routinely
wait
until
the
last
minute,
1
minute
before
his
execution,
to
file
his
first
federal
habeas,
and
that's
no
problem,
that
you
get
one
free
postponement
of
the
execution
by
just
filing
a
federal
habeas,
so
long
as
you
make
a
claim
that
is,
as
you
say,
a
substantial
claim,
not
necessarily
true,
but
a
substantial
claim.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
true
even
if,
because
of
the
lateness
of
the
filing,
the
state
is
unable
to
present
what
could
well
be
a
claim
showing
how
the
state
has
been
prejudiced
by
the
delay?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
barefoot
says
that
federal
habeas
is
not
essential
to
the
validity
of
a
death
penalty,
and
so
supposing
i
am
a
federal
district
judge
sitting
in
atlanta,
and
i'm
brought
a
petition
5
minutes
before
an
execution
is
scheduled
for,
and
i
simply
say,
i
can't
possibly
digest
the
contents
of
this
petition
at
this
time,
it's
so
late.
what
do
i
do?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
the
petitioner
has
to
persuade
the
judge
that
there's
some
federal
flaw
in
the
punishment
procedure,
or
the
guilty
phase,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
the
fault
of
the
petitioner
that
it
can't
be
done.
unknown
speaker
okay,
there's
no
statute
of
limitations,
and
nobody
is
saying
that
you're
barred
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
in
habeas.
but
you're
coming
in
5
minutes
before
an
absolute
deadline
with
a
complicated
thing
that
can't
be
digested
in
the
remaining
5
minutes.
why
can't
the
judge
say,
sorry,
the
burden
is
on
you,
and
you've
just
come
in
too
late
to
establish
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i'm...
this
is
a
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
mr.
verrilli,
take
the
chief's
example
with
one
further
fact
added.
the
judge
asks
the
same
question
that
he
asked
as
the
chief
justice
put
the
hypo
to
you,
and
there
is
also
before
him
this
further
fact,
that
the
prison
warden
had
gone
to
this
prisoner
five
times
in
the
last
6
months
saying,
legal
services
are
available
to
you,
do
you
want
to
file
a
habeas
petition
because
we're
setting
the
execution
date
and
we
don't
want
to
be
doing
this
at
the
last
minute,
and
his
answer
in
each
case
was,
i'm
going
to
file
one,
but
i'm
going
to
wait
till
the
last
minute
because
i
have
a
right
to
file
it
5
minutes
beforehand.
in
that
case,
would
you
say
that
under
this
rule
the
court
was
required
to
stay
it
and
consider
it
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
how
about
my
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
does
your
argument,
then,
boil
down
to
this,
that
if
we
don't
know...
if
we
don't
have
affirmative
knowledge
of
the
reason
for
the
delay,
5
minutes
is
not
enough,
and
that's
as
far
as
you're
going?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
can
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
run
out
of
time?
are
you...
you're
still
representing
this
person,
and
he
wants
you
to
represent
him
here?
unknown
speaker
he's
made
it
clear
that
he
wants
this
case
to
be
brought
here
in
the
court?
unknown
speaker
okay,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
verrilli.
ms.
westmoreland,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
westmoreland,
could
the
state
court
have
done,
in
effect,
the
same
thing?
the
state
court,
as
i...
if
i've
got
my
facts
straight,
dismissed
the
first
state
habeas
petition
without
prejudice,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
that's
right...
not
the
next
friend
petitions--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
first
one
of
his.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
why
the
state
court
judge
could
not
have
said
at
that
point,
this
is
your
chance
to
bring
a
state
habeas
petition,
and
this
is
the
only
one
you're
going
to
get,
and
i'm
going
to...
you
either
go
forward
with
this,
raising
whatever
you
can
raise,
or
i'm
going
to
dismiss
it
with
prejudice,
not
without
prejudice,
but
with
prejudice.
could
the
state
court
judge
have
done
that?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
order
was
without
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
question
of
georgia
law.
unknown
speaker
so
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
georgia
made
the
decision
at
some
level
that
in
fact
this
would
be
without
prejudice,
whereas
georgia
could
have
made
the
converse
decision
and
said,
it's
going
to
be
with
prejudice,
in
which
case
there
would
have
been
a...
i...
there
would
have
been
a,
i
suppose,
a
state
bar
to
raising
anything
that
once
an
appeal
from
that
was
exhausted
openly
to
this
court--
unknown
speaker
--that
would
have
barred
anything
that
could
have
been
raised
and
we
really
wouldn't
be
in
this
position,
would
we?
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
barred
all
the
claims
that
he
could
have
brought
at
that
point.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
ms.
westmoreland,
in
this
present
federal
habeas
proceeding,
did
the
state
try
to
make
any
showing
that
it
had
been
prejudiced
by
this
late
filing?
unknown
speaker
and
why
not?
unknown
speaker
could
we
just
review
a
little
bit
the
factual
circumstances
here?
a
period
of
time
had
been
set
within
which
the
execution
could
be
carried
out.
it
was
june
20
to
30th--
unknown
speaker
--a
10-day
period?
unknown
speaker
a
7-day
period.
unknown
speaker
and
the
petition
filed
by
petitioner
was
filed
2
days
before
the
expiration
of
that
period?
unknown
speaker
and
did
the
state
tell
the
federal
district
court
that
it
was
unable
to
file
a
response
because
of
the
lateness
of
the
filing?
unknown
speaker
but
did
the
state
explain
to
the
court...
do
you
think
it
was
clear
to
the
court
that
it
was
the
state's
position
that
it
did
not
have
time
to
make
a
response?
unknown
speaker
if
you
didn't
invoke
rule
9...
i
take
it
you
didn't
invoke
it.
you
didn't
say
we're
going
to
come
in
and
show
that
we're
prejudiced.
so
then
what
you're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
say
there's
a
new
ground
for
denying
a
habeas
petition
that
no
one's
ever
invoked
before,
and
if
there
is
a
good
ground,
and
there
may
be,
i'm
not
saying
there
isn't,
why
isn't
that
a
matter
that
we
would
leave
to
congress
and
the
rules
committees
rather
than
say
there's
an
ill-defined
power
to
make
up
new
grounds,
which
i
guess
would
work
both
ways.
sometimes
there
would
be
new
grounds,
never
made
up
before,
to
deny
petitions,
and
sometimes
they
would
be
new
grounds,
never
heard
of
before,
for
granting
petitions.
but
rather
than
say
there
is
an
ill-defined
power
in
the
federal
court
simply
to
grant
or
deny
petitions
on
grounds
that
have
not
appeared
yet
in
our
cases
and
have
not
appeared
in
the
rules
or
in
the
statutes,
rather
we'll
stick
to
barefoot
v.
estelle
and
keep
to
what
we've
seen
in
the
past
and
let
congress
and
the
rules
committees
decide
when
there
are
new
grounds.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
saying
that
you
didn't...
i'm
not
turning
to
blame
or
praise
for
a
particular
instance.
i'm
saying,
i
take
it...
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
you
and
the
eleventh
circuit
have
a
new
ground
for
denying
a
first
petition
never
invoked
before.
certainly
my
law
clerks
in
the
library
could
not
find
a
comparable
instance
forever.
maybe
this
kind
of
thing
is
good,
maybe
it
isn't,
but
the
issue
before
us,
i
would
take
it,
is
whether
there
is
a
general
power
in
the
federal
courts
to
create
new
grounds
not
found
in
barefoot
v.
estelle
or
later
cases
for
either
granting
or
denying
petitions.
if
that's
the
issue,
i
guess
my
first
thought
would
be,
why
isn't
it
up
to
congress,
or
later
experience,
or
the
rules
committees
to
embody
those
new
kinds
of
grounds,
rather
than
simply
giving
a
mandate
to
the
lower
courts
to
do
whatever
they
think
is
nice
in
the
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
we
could
find
no
instance,
so
you
can
tell
me
what
the
instance
is.
we
could
find
no
instance
in
a
first
petition
where
a
court
had
denied
the
first
petition
without
following
rule
9
or
some
other
well-established
ground.
now,
what
is
the
instance
where
this
was--
unknown
speaker
--right.
so
then
am
i
right
in
thinking
what
this
court
would
be
doing
if
you're
upheld
is
to
say
the
lower
federal
courts
are
free
to
create
new
grounds.
sometimes
they'll
be
for
denying
petitions,
sometimes
they'll
be
for
granting
petitions.
we'll
have
to
supervise
it,
i
guess,
and
that
seems
a
rather
far-reaching
proposition,
and
contrary
to
barefoot
v.
estelle,
and
that's
what
i'm
putting
to
you
to
hear
your
response.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
the
other
way
will
work,
too.
unknown
speaker
we'll
got
a
lot
of
cases
where
they
have
new
grounds
in
equity
for
granting
them,
and
why...
i
mean,
normally,
i
take
it
barefoot
v.
estelle
was
a
statement
that
by
and
large
we
will
follow
traditional
practices
rather
specifically
or
leave
it
up
to
the
rules
committee
rather
than
just
have
a
general
mandate.
am
i
right
about
that,
to
make
up--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let's
see
how
it
might
work.
suppose
we
had
in
this
case
everything
you're
saying
except
for
one
thing,
and
the
one
thing
is
if
there
had
been
no
next
friend
petitions,
so
that
we
take
out
of
it
the
question
whether
this
was
effectively
a
successive
federal
petition,
no
next
friend
petitions
at
all.
would
that
have
fit
your
category
of
something
outside
9(a)
and
(b)
but
nonetheless
can
be
an
abuse
of
the
writ?
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
westmoreland,
do
you
take
the
position
that
a
last
minute
filing
of
a
first
federal
habeas,
without
all
these
intervening
next
friend
things,
is
inherently
prejudicial
under
rule
9(a)?
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
fits
under
9(a)
simply
because
the
filing
is
so
close
to
the
deadline?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
as
big
a
step
as
saying
the
court
can
go
outside
rule
9
and
develop
new
grounds,
but
you
aren't
trying
to
shoehorn
this
into
rule
9(a).
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
strongest
position,
that
it
is
effectively
a
succeeding
federal
habeas
petition?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any...
is
there
any
authority
that
you
could
find
where
courts
have
said
that
a
next
friend
petition
which
is
dismissed
without
prejudice
is
to
be
regarded
as
in
fact
a
first
federal
habeas
petition?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
in
that
regard,
please,
just
one
question?
supposing
instead
of
the
next
friends
being
his
brother
and
his
sister,
the
state
itself
had
a
psychiatrist
who
was
concerned
about
the
mental
condition
of
the
person
about
to
be
executed,
and
the
defendant
kept
saying
i'm
perfectly
healthy,
i
want
to
be
executed
and
all
the
rest,
but
the
state's
genuine
doubt
led
to
precisely
the
same
delay
that
you
had
here.
then
they
finally
made
up
their
mind,
yes,
he's
competent,
and
they
set
the
execution
date,
and
he
immediately
changed
his
mind
and
filed
a
first
federal
habeas.
what
result?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
state
did
nothing.
very
often
you
have
long
delays
because
it's
hard
to
get
these
things
arranged,
and
what
if
nothing
happened?
would
it
be
the
same
case
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not?
is
it
because
he's
responsible
for
the
next
friend
petitions?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
could
have
in
my
hypothetical
about
the
state
having
its
own
psychiatrist
have
these
doubts.
he
could
have
said...
gone
ahead
any
time
he
wanted.
why
is
that
case
different?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
that
if
everything
just
remained
in
status
quo
from
1990
to
1995,
for
reasons
that
the
state
just
didn't
decide
to
execute
him
promptly
enough,
you
would
not
deny
he
could
then
come
in
5
minutes
before
the
execution
and
get
an
automatic
stay.
unknown
speaker
so
the
last
minute
application
for
stay
is
not,
per
se,
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
unknown
speaker
then
i--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
all
that's
involved
is
that
(a)
he
had
the
opportunity,
which
he
had
in
my
hypothetical,
and
(b),
you
somehow
are
attributing
his
brother's
and
sister's
activities
as
though
he
was
really
behind
them.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
could
have
happened
in
my
hypothetical.
when
the
state
is,
on
its
own
motion,
conducting
hearings
all
along
the
line
trying
to
satisfy
itself
he's
an
appropriate
candidate
for
execution
he'd
be
in
court
repeatedly,
and
you're
saying
that
would
be
a
different
case.
unknown
speaker
but
in
each
of
the
cases,
in
the
case
of
each
prior
petition,
he
in
effect
was
saying,
i
am
not
incompetent,
and
i
do
not
want
these
people
to
file
these
things
for
me.
unknown
speaker
and
so
all
he
has
done,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
change
his
mind
at
the
last
minute
that
he
wants
his
case
reviewed,
and
yet
you
have
said
that
under
georgia
law
he
could
perfectly
well
do
that
if
he
had
sat
silent
for
6
years.
so
in...
it
seems
to
me...
i
guess
i'm
getting...
trying
to
make
the
same
point
that
justice
stevens'
question
did.
unless
you
are
going
to
attribute
the
brother
and
sister
petitions
to
him,
i
don't
see
why
his
position
is
any
different,
essentially,
from
what
it
would
have
been
if
for
6
years
he
had
said,
i
don't
want
relief,
i
want
to
die,
and
at
the
end
of
6
years,
with
5
minutes
to
go,
he
said,
i've
changed
my
mind.
i
don't
see
what
the
difference
is,
unless
you
attribute
the
brother
and
sister
to
him.
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
had
the
opportunity
in
justice
stevens'
hypo--
unknown
speaker
--and
he
would
simply
have
sat
on
it.
the
only
difference
is,
in
one
case
he
would
have
been
sitting
on
it
in
a
jail
cell,
and
in
another
case
he
was
sitting
on
it
during
certain
periods
of
time
when
he
was
pulled
into
court
against
his
will.
unknown
speaker
absolutely,
and
in
each
case
he
said,
i'm
competent.
i
don't
want
these
people
filing
claims
on
my
behalf.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
wasn't
he
free
to
take
that
position?
unknown
speaker
but
he
is
saying
that
he
does
have
a
claim
that
entitles
him
to
relief.
he's
saying
that.
unknown
speaker
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
may
motivate
him
to
change
his
position
going
forward
here,
but
so...
don't
we
have
to
take
his
claim
at
this
point
as
a
claim
that
he
is
entitled
to
some
relief,
i
presume
a
vacation
of
his
conviction,
and
he
is
making
that
claim,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
then
if
he's
not,
then
the
thing
should
be
thrown
out
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
then
you'll
get
your
relief.
if
that's
the
case,
then
you'll
get
your
relief
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
not
on
the
invocation
of
some
new
equity
room.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
you're--
unknown
speaker
--that's
a
separate
issue,
and
so
far
at
least
in
the
federal
court
you
haven't
had
any
success
on
that,
in
part
because
the
federal
court
went
off
on
another
ground,
but
leaving
that
aside,
until
it
is
dismissed,
i
guess
we
have
to
assume
that
he's
making
a
claim
which
says
i'm
entitled
to
some
relief
here,
and
the
relief,
in
fact,
if
i
get
it,
will
prolong
my
life,
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
we...
haven't
we
got
to
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
he
said
in
open
court
was,
i
want
this
relief
because
i
want
to
buy
time,
and
in
that
time
i
hope
the
state
is
going
to
change
its
method
of
execution
so
that
when
and
if
i
am
executed,
or
when
i
am
executed,
i
may
drop
my
proceedings,
if
that
happened.
i
will
drop
my
proceeding
if
that
happened.
i
can
donate
my
organs
to
an
organ
bank,
or
to
science,
or
whatever.
that's
what
he
said,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
in
its
opinion
that
he
had
filed
for
improper
purposes?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
in
effect
before
us.
unknown
speaker
and
the
improper
purpose
was
this
desire
to
wait
so
that
he
could
make
the
organ
donation,
right?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
isn't
he...
if
he
is
entitled
to
relief
on
his
claim,
taken
by
itself,
isn't
he
entitled
to
do
with
his
life
what
he
wants
to
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
that's
the
separate
issue.
if
that's
the
case,
you
will
succeed
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
if
he
hasn't
stated
a
claim,
you're
going
to
get
it
thrown
out
because
he
hasn't
stated
a
claim,
and
that's
not
before
us,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not
say,
he
has
not
stated
a
claim.
the
eleventh...
as
i
understand
it,
the
eleventh
circuit
said
he
has
engaged
in
delaying
tactics
which,
on
equitable
grounds,
we
are
entitled
to
consider
in
denying
the
petition.
isn't
that
what
it
said?
unknown
speaker
sure,
but...
no,
but
all
i'm
saying
is,
we
are
not
here
to
consider
whether
or
not
he
stated
a
claim
upon
which
habeas
relief
could
be
granted,
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
right.
okay.
unknown
speaker
okay,
so
if
we
put
that
issue
aside,
we've
got
to
assume
that
he
has,
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding,
stated
a
claim,
and
the
answer
which
comes,
i
guess,
out
of
the
circuit,
and
what
you're
saying
is,
that
shouldn't
matter,
because
he
wants
to
use
his
relief
for
an
improper
purpose,
and
the
improper
purpose
is
to
live
long
enough
to
donate
his
organs
to
science,
and
my
question
to
you
is,
if
he
is
entitled
to
relief,
which
we
have
to
assume
at
this
point
he
is,
why
is
he
not
entitled
to
use
the
life
or
the
period
of
life
that
he
gains
by
it
for
whatever
purpose
he
chooses?
unknown
speaker
okay,
then
it
ought
to
be
thrown
out
because
he
is
not
seeking
relief
upon
which
habeas
corpus
can
grant
relief,
but
that's
a
separate
issue,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
we've
got
to
assume
that
that
issue
is
not
before
us
right
now.
now,
why...
if
we
make
that
assumption,
what's
the
answer
to
my
question
that
he
ought
to
be
entitled
to
use
whatever
life
he
gets
for
whatever
purpose
he
wants
to
use
it?
what's
the
answer
to
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
then
gets
us
solely
to
the
matter
of
delay,
and
you
have
said
that
even
under
georgia
law
he
could
have
delayed
up
until
5
minutes
and
that
would
not
disentitle
him
on
equitable
principles
under
georgia
law
to
relief.
unknown
speaker
ms.
westmoreland,
i
thought
you
were
not
willing
to
accept
that
assumption.
i
thought
what--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
i
thought
not.
i
thought
that
your
position
is,
yes,
we're
not
entitled
to
a
dismissal.
that's
been
ruled
on,
and
it
states
a
claim
on
its
face,
but
nonetheless,
for
equitable
purposes
you
can
consider
the
purpose
for
which
he
is
seeking
relief
as
a
factor
in
the
equitable
judgment.
unknown
speaker
it's
the
same
factor
that
could
be
used
for
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint,
but
merely
because
you
can't
dismiss
the
complaint
doesn't
mean
you
that
you
cannot
consider
it
as
an
equitable
factor.
unknown
speaker
is
that
normally
an
equity,
that...
i
mean,
if
i
think
that
somebody
is
sitting
on
my
piece
of
property,
and
i
get
an
injunction
to
get
rid
of
them,
and
i'm
legally
entitled
to
the
injunction,
does
it
matter
if
i
want
to
get
rid
of
him
because
i
hate
him,
rather
than
i
couldn't
care
less
whether
he's
actually
on
the
property?
i
mean,
i've
just
never
seen
that
in
equity,
but
maybe
it
is,
i
don't...
that
the
motive
matters
as
opposed
to
whether
you're
legally
entitled
to
get
rid
of
this
person
or
not
get
rid
of
him.
what
matters,
whether
you
like
him,
you
don't
like
him,
is
there
some
equitable
principle?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
take
it
his
purpose,
he
says,
look,
i'm
legally
entitled
not
to
be
executed
because
there
were
legal
mistakes
made
in
my
trial
in
earlier
proceedings.
does
it
matter
if
the
reason
he
doesn't
want
to
be
executed
is
because
he
wants
to
live
forever,
or
because
he
feels
that
he'd
like
to
use
the
last
few
years
left
to
him
to
make
certain
his
organs
are
donated
to
help
humanity?
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
ms.
westmoreland,
you
listed
a
series
of
factors
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
the
equities.
it's
true
habeas
is
an
equitable
remedy,
but
isn't
there
also
a
large
concern
that
there
shouldn't
be
unevenness?
equity
discretion
for
the
individual
chancellor
may
fit
one
way
when
we're
talking
about
distribution
of
property,
it
may
fit
another
way
when
we're
talking
about
life
or
death.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
why
rules
are
important,
so
that
everybody
will
do
it
the
same
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
lot
of
stretch
left
in
rule
9
anyway,
isn't
there,
9(b),
for
example,
if
the
judge
finds
that
the
failure
of
the
petition
constituted
an
abuse
of
the
writ?
there's
a
lot
of
leeway
allowed
as
to
what
the
judge
may
consider
to
be
abuse
of
the
writ,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
to
get
into
that
box,
though,
it
has
to
be
a
successive
petition.
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
earlier
question,
and
that
is,
if
this
case,
given
the
importance
that
we
all
agree
a...
some
kind
of
a
regime
of
general
rules
has,
isn't
the
very
fact
that
this
case
is
so
unusual,
perhaps
it
is
truly
unique,
a
good
reason
not
to
use
this
case
as
the
occasion
to
fashion
a
new
rule
which
in
fact
is
broader
than
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
rule
which
addresses
this
situation
under
circumstances
which
equity
courts
have
never
done
before.
you
agree...
justice
breyer
said,
i
can't
find
any
examples
of
this--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
said,
i
can't,
either.
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
that
a
good
reason
not
to
use
this
as
the
springboard
for
a
new
line
of
equity
jurisprudence?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
westmoreland.
unknown
speaker
mr.
verrilli,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
it
still
uses
electrocution.
