add
that
in
codispoti
each
individual
sentence
was
for
less
than
6
months,
so
when
you
combine
that
with
blanton,
you
have
a
series
of
6
months
offenses.
that's
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
that's...
and...
go
ahead.
i
just
wanted
to
see
that
that
was--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--maybe
i
should
ask,
because
the
thing
that
i
find
difficult
with
codispoti
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
codispoti's...
you
have
cases
that
stand
for
the
proposition
if
you
have
more
than
a
major...
minor
offense,
you
have
to
have
a
jury,
all
right,
and
here
we
have
only
minor
offenses.
codispoti
seems
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
you
add
them
all
up
and
they
add
to
more
than
6
months,
you
have
to
have
a
jury,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
why
isn't
the
obvious
answer
to
that
here,
well,
the
constitution
forbids
your
client
from
being
punished
by
more
than
6
months.
he
wasn't.
end
of
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
need
be
no
promise.
the
constitution
forbids
a
person
tried
for
a
series
of
minor
offenses,
each
of
which
has
a
maximum,
from
going
to
prison
for
more
than
6
months.
if
they
try
to
put
him
in
for
more
than
6
months,
he's
released
on
habeas.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
codispoti.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
two
things.
you
get
a
jury
trial
if
you're
being
punished
for
other
than
a
minor
offense.
that's
where
you
start,
and
in
addition
to
that,
you
get
a
jury
trial
if
you're
going
to
be
put
away
for
more
than
6
months.
codispoti.
i
suppose
your
response
is
that
the
constitution
says
you
get
a
jury
trial
if
it's
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
didn't
understand
about
codispoti.
it
seemed
to
me
the
language
there
was
continuously
referring
to
what
the
sentence
for
a
series
of
minor
offenses
actually
was,
not
what
he
faced.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i...
and
if
that's
so,
then
there'd
be
a
constitutional
bar,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
is
what
it
meant.
i
mean,
i...
that's
what
i
was...
that's
why
i
was
quite
interested
what
you
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it's
a
promise...
i
mean,
there's
something
rather
disturbing
about
saying
anyone
of,
you
know,
several
thousand
magistrates
here
at
some
point,
or
judges
or
whatever,
they're
all
just
going
to
take
it
on
themselves,
and
they
might
say
some
words,
and
then
we'll
get
into
an
argument
about
what
they
meant,
and...
i
mean,
this
whole
set
of
rules,
i
take
it,
is
a
judgemade
effort
to
create
a
kind
of
rough
order
on
a
common
law
that
was
very
unrough
in
terms
of
the
meaning
of
criminal
proceeding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
at
that
point
i
need
some
help.
that
is,
there's
a
kind
of
chicken-and-egg
problem.
it's...
i'm
not
certain
what
codispoti
means,
rejecting
your
first
argument,
whether
it's
face
or
actual,
what
the
theory
is.
