justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
like
the
kind
of
determination
that
lawyers
might
make
instead
of
the
clients.
i
hope
that's
not
the
case
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you're
arguing
that
the
larger
the
number,
the
more
important
it
is
to
vindicate
the
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
your
point.
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it's
true
that
in
the
examples
you
give,
those
would
have
been
separate
prosecutions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas,
here
you
have
one
prosecution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
constitution
refers
to
prosecution
as
the
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
argues
as
a
practical
matter
the
prosecution
isn't
going
to
do
that.
if
you've
got
a
couple
of
petty
offenses
like
this,
why
would
the
prosecutor
separate
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
isn't
it
in
99
and
99/100th
percent
of
the
cases
of
this
kind
that
would
be
tried
jointly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
know
you
could
give
a
lot
of
hypothetical
cases,
but
as
a
practical
matter
it's
just
a
waste
of
time
to
have
two
separate
trials
in
a
matter
like
this.
i
mean,
prosecutors
don't...
are
too
busy
to
do
what
you're
suggesting,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can
you
not
say
the
legislature
has
authorized
a
maximum
punishment
of
12
months
on
the
facts
in
this
particular
prosecution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
legislature
certainly
decided
that
if
these
two
misdemeanors
are
tried
together,
the
judge
is
authorized
to
impose
a
sentence
of
12
months.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct,
but
it
includes
the
cases
the
are
tried
together.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
does
authorize
in
the
cases
that
are
tried
together
a
12-month
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
can't
reflect
the
determination
that
two
misdemeanors
are
more
serious
than
one,
or
twice
as
serious
as
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
of
course,
they're
not
subject
to
it
because
they're
not
one
prosecution
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
do
look
at
the
prosecution
as
a
unit,
you
could
have,
i
suppose,
10
or
15
misdemeanors
joined
together
in
10
times
6
months
in
a
single
prosecution.
that's
your
position,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
a
prosecution
decision
to
have
10
separate
trials
instead
of
one
joint
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
have
any
comment
on
justice
kennedy's
question
of
your
adversary
about
how
serious
a
problem
this
really
is?
do
you
happen
to
know...
he
gave
figures
about
the
federal
system,
which
i
assume
you
accept.
do
you
have
any
further
enlightenment
on
the
extent
of
the
problem
in
the
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
