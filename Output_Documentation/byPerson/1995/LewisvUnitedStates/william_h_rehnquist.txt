chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-6465,
ray
lewis
v.
united
states.
mr.
statsinger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you,
at
any
rate,
are
not
arguing
for
a
compulsory
joinder
rule
along
with
your
view
of
the
jury
trial
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not
the
way
our
cases
have
interpreted
it.
i
mean,
the
nevada
case,
several
others,
have
focused
primarily
on
the
potential
for
incarceration.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
there's
a
lot
worse
stigma
being
convicted
of
two
counts
than
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
that's
logical,
why
did
the
court
ever
say
that
a
jury
trial
doesn't
carry
over
to
misdemeanors?
i
mean,
should
you
have
an
unfair
misdemeanor
trial
where
your
maximum
sentence
is
3
months?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say
regardless
of
the
promise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you
say
the
sentencing
consequences,
and
it
is
quite
an
abstract
thing.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
maximum
sentence
which
this
particular
defendant
might
face.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
state
court
situation
that
justice
kennedy
was
asking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
talking
about
17
or
20,
i
guess.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
this...
no
one
is
saying
here
that
duncan
should
be
changed.
this
is
just
an
application
of
duncan,
and
surely
it's
a
fair
question
of
how
is
this
going
to
affect
prosecutions
in
the
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
codispoti,
there
was
no
limit
on
the
sentence
for
contempt,
was
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
really
isn't
on
all
fours,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
might
be
persuasive
if
the
reason
bench
trials
were
reversed
here
was
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
judgment
conviction,
but
i
take
it
that's
not
what
you're
saying.
i
mean,
a
judge
presides
over
a
jury
trial
just
as
well
as
a
bench
trial
and
can
make
all
sorts
of
errors
even
with
a
jury
present.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
statsinger.
ms.
pillard,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pillard.
mr.
statsinger,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
statsinger.
the
case
is
submitted.
