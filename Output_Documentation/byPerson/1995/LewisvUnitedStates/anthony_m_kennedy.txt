justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
then
it's
not
just
the
power
of
the
judge
that
you're
concerned
with,
it's
the
dignitary
or
the
interest
or
the
stigma
that's
attached
to
the
crime.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
has
to
be
your
principal
justification
if
the
judge
says,
or
the
prosecution
says
at
the
outset
that
6
months
is
the
maximum.
if
that's
taken
out
of
play,
then
what
are
you
left
with,
other
than
this
stigma
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
you'll
argue
that
this
is
quite
irrelevant
either
way,
but
i
have
no
sense
of
how
burdensome
this
rule
that
you
propose
would
be
on
all
of
the
state
courts.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
magistrates'
courts,
municipal
courts
all
over
the
country,
multiple
charges
are
frequently
made.
prosecutors
like
to
have
multiple
charges,
misdemeanor
varieties
and
so
forth,
but
it
seems
to
me
this
might
be
a
very,
very
burdensome
rule,
but
i
have
no
statistics.
i
have
no
real
grasp
for
that
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
likely
that
it
will,
because
6
months
is
a
fairly
common
cutoff
point
for
petty
offenses,
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
ordinary,
quite
frequent
for
prosecutions
to
charge
more
than
one
petty
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
argue
that
there's
no
right,
even
if
there's
an
agreement
in
advance,
undertaking
in
advance
to
limit
the
sentence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
justice
of
the
peace
have
the
authority
to
send
the
defendant
to
prison,
though,
as
opposed
to
a
jail?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
were
the
terms
there,
the
length...
the
length
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
you
have
multiple
crimes
with
a
common
modus
operandi
and
they're
aggravated
so
there's
a
potential
of
a
5-year
sentence,
say,
even
though
individually
each
crime
is
only
6
months,
there
is
something
disturbing
about
saying
the
defendant
must
stand
before
the
judge
without
the
protection
of
the
jury
in
that
case.
i
recognize
that
he
could
go
before
the
judge
5
different
days,
although
that
would
assume
that
the
government
would
deliberately
try
to
defeat
the
jury-trial
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
a
state--
--i
wasn't
aware
that
our--
--suppose
a
state
legislature
said
that
if
the
prosecution
in
its
discretion,
at
its
option,
goes
before,
say,
a
municipal
court
and
consolidates
offenses,
joins
offenses,
that
in
that
case
the
sentence
for
all
combined
offenses
will
be
no
more
than
6
months.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that
if
the
prosecution
had
the
option,
it
elected
the
option
to
go
to
another
court,
that
the
offenses
would
be
greater.
what
would
be
the
result
there?
