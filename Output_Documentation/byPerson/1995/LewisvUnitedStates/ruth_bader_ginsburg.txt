wouldn't
be
if
the
counts
were
split
up
into
two
separate
prosecutions.

mr.
statsinger,
i
have
a
question...
i
don't
know
whether
it
goes
to
standing,
but
this
sentence
here
was
probation,
right?
why
would
a
defendant
who
got
probation,
no
jail
time,
want
to
risk
a
new
trial
before
a
jury
when
the
end
result
of
that
could
be
jail
time?
justice
ruth
bader

ms.
pillard--
--well...
go
ahead.
thinking
of
an
analogy
to
the
seventh
amendment
on
the
civil
side,
there's
a
whole
string
of
cases
in
this
court
that
said
the
old
idea
that
the
judge
could
set
the
order
of
trial
by
putting
the
equitable
claim
before
the
legal,
that
didn't
fly
because
the
jury-trial
right
was
so
basic
that
whenever
there
was
a
choice
the
legal
claim
had
to
be
treated
first
so
that
the
jury
would
preempt
the
judge.
now,
if
that's
the
mind
set
that
was
supposed
to
bring
to
jury
trial
the
seventh
amendment,
why
shouldn't
it
be
the
same
in
the
sixth
amendment,
and
you
say
well,
you
could
argue
it
as
the
prosecution
is
the
unit,
you
could
argue
it
as
the
crime
is
the
unit,
but
in
view
of
the
importance
of
jury
trial,
you
take
the
prosecution
as
the
unit,
and
if
the
two
add
up
to
more
than
6
months,
you
get
a
jury
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
consider
relevant
to
this
problem
that
we
have
that
in
the
old
days,
1791,
this
would
not
have
been
a
petty
offense,
it
would
have
been...
this
offense
would
have
been
a
rather
serious
offense.
