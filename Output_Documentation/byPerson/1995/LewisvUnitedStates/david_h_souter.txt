justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
we
accept
your
view
in
order
to
make
anything
but
sort
of
a
farcical
rule
we
would
have
to,
i
suppose,
have
a
rule
of
compulsory
joinder.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may,
it
may
not.
i
mean,
it
may
get
a
benefit
if
the
evidence,
in
fact,
is
common
to
all
of
the
counts,
or
all
of
the
separate
indictments,
but
if
the
government
really
wants
somebody
to
do
the
maximum
amount
of
hard
time,
i
suppose
even
under
the
guidelines
there's
some
reason
to
believe
the
total
will
be
greater
if
they're
tried
separately.
so
the
government
might
be
under
conflicting
motivations
and
it
might
in
some
cases
decide
to
sever,
and
i
would
suppose
if
it
does,
unless
we
have
a
compulsory
joinder
rule,
then
the
rule
that
you
argue
for
is
not
going
to
be
of
any
practical
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
have
paid
me
a
great
compliment.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know
whether
at
common
law
at
the
period
that
would
be
relevant
for
us,
which
would
be
the
time
of
the
founding,
that
justices
committed
to
prison
or
to
jail
as
punishments
as
distinct
from
simply
incarceration
awaiting
trial?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
1791?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
would
matter.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
if
that
developed
afterwards,
then
it
wouldn't
be
comprehended
by
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
you
would
be
willing
to
accept
it,
but
do
you
have
any
authority
to
that
effect?
