ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
any
case
involving
only
offenses
that
congress
has
defined
as
petty
may
be
tried
without
a
jury.
petitioner
has
no
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
because
both
of
the
offenses
in
this
case
were
defined
by
congress
as
petty.
petitioner
acknowledges
that
the
united
states
could
have
charged
him
with
the
same
offenses
in
two
separate
informations
and
tried
him
without
a
jury
in
two
separate
trials.
in
fact,
he
could
have
been
tried
in
separate
seriatim
trials
before
the
same
judge
on
the
same
day,
and
he
could
have
been
sentenced
to
a
total
of
a
year
in
prison
in
the
two
proceedings.
in
petitioner's
view,
he
would
have
had
no
jury
right
in
that
situation.
the
petty
character
of
obstruction
of
the
mails
is
unchanged
by
the
prosecutor's
decision
in
this
case
to
try
the
two
counts
together.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
those
would
have
been
separate
prosecutions,
justice
stevens.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
here
you
have
one
prosecution.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
we
believe
there's
no
basis
to
petitioner's
textual
argument
that
the
constitutional
reference
to
criminal
prosecutions
means
that
the
prosecution
as
a
whole
is
the
relevant
unit
for
purposes
of
the
jury-right
analysis.
the
petty
offense
exclusion
has
already
made
clear
that
criminal
prosecutions
exclude
prosecutions
of
petty
offenses.
moreover,
this
court
in
callan
v.
wilson
specified
that
the
sixth
amendment
did
not
expand
the
jury
right
as
articulated
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
article
iii
refers
not
to
prosecutions,
but
to
crimes,
and
this
court's
cases
have
made
clear
that
crimes,
as
specified
in
article
iii,
and
the
criminal
prosecutions
as
specified
in
the
sixth
amendment,
are
limited
to
serious
crimes.
therefore,
petitioner's
argument
reduces
to
arguing
that
serious
offense
prosecutions
are
covered
by
the
sixth
amendment.
it
doesn't
support
the
weight
he
tries
to
give
it.
under
the
petitioner's
theory,
the
criminal
prosecution
theory
also
makes
no
sense,
because
under
his
theory
an
individual
charged
with
two
petty
crimes
that
are
tried
separately
but
who
faces
the
same
total
year
consequence
would
be
treated
differently
from
an
individual
who
is
charged
with
those
two
petty
offenses
in
one--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--well,
the
joinder
rule
is
discretionary,
it's
not
mandatory.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
there
are
plenty
of
practical
situations
in
which
two
offenses
perhaps
arising,
one
a
couple
of
months
later
than
the
other,
might
happen
to
go
to
trial
separately,
that
individual
could
have--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--the
basic
point,
though,
is
that
you
look
not
to
the
prosecutor's
decision
under
rule
8
whether
to
join
or
not
to
join,
but
the
established
methodology
for
determining
which
offenses
are
serious
is
to
look
to
the
legislative
assessment
of
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
or
the
offenses,
and
the
prosecutor's
decision
whether
or
not
to
join
is
not
a
legislative
assessment.
when
the
legislature
authorizes
a
maximum
sentence
of
6
months
incarceration,
that's
the
legislature's
determination.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
no,
and
that
follows
on
the
response
that
petitioner's
counsel
gave
to
justice
scalia.
petitioner's
counsel
relies
on
section
3584,
which
authorizes
consecutive
sentencing.
however,
that
provision
is
not
a
prosecution-specific
provision.
that
provision
applies
equally
to
the
cases
that
are...
the
two
petty
offenses
that
are
separately
tried
seriatim
as
it
applies
to
the
two
cases
consolidated
together,
so
you
can't
say
that
that
is
a
legislative
determination
speaking
to
the
seriousness
of
any
particular
offense
or
combination--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--the
congress--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--the
congress--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--justice
stevens,
i
think
it's
not
correct,
because
3584
speaks
to
the
situation
of
multiple
crimes
without
regard
to
whether
they're
tried
together,
whereas
petitioner's
rule--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it
does,
but
it
includes--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
think
my
point,
justice
stevens,
is
that
because
that
legislative
authorization,
3584,
speaks
equally
to
the
situation
of
separate
trials
and
to
the
situation
of
trials
together,
it
can't
reflect
a
determination
by
congress
that
the
together
situation
is
more
serious.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
precisely
right,
it
doesn't
reflect
that,
because
the
two
tried
separately,
as
petitioner
concedes,
are
not
subject
to
the
jury
right,
and
therefore
that
congressional
determination--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--moreover,
i
would
point
to
this
court's
language
in
blanton
v.
las
vegas,
in
which
the
court
pointed
to
the
relevant
legislative
determination
of
seriousness
as
the
determination
that
the
legislature
includes
within
the
definition
of
the
crime
itself
that
in
setting
the
maximum
penalty
for
the
particular
offense,
it's
looking
at
that
offense
as
the
unit
and
setting
the
maximum
penalty
for
that
offense.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
our
position.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
as
a
theoretical
matter,
you
could.
you
could
also
have
that
same
result
as
a
result
of
serial,
separate
prosecutions.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
criminal
area
as
well,
where
a
collateral
estoppel
issue
would
arise
and
where
the
jury
right
would
apply
to
the
separate
claims,
we
believe
the
same
principle
would
follow.
but
i
think
the
broader
point,
whether
the
importance
of
the
jury
right
requires
a
jury
right
here,
is
clearly
refuted
by
the
common
law
antecedents
of
the
jury
right,
that
those
were
the
antecedents
that
the
framers
had
in
mind
in
excluding
the
petty
offenses
from
the
coverage
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
court's
categorical
distinction
between
petty
and
serious
offenses
derives
from
the
common
law
practice
of
trying
petty
offenses
to
juries.
the
petty
offense
exclusion
was
around
at
the
time
of
the
framers,
and
the
common
law
basically
establish
a
jurisdictional
divide.
it
had
petty
offenses
which
went
to
justices
of
the
peace
and
were
tried
without
juries.
serious
offenses
went
to
a
jury.
and
given
that
sort
of
jurisdictional,
structural
allocation,
it
makes
clear
that
it
doesn't
make
a
difference,
for
example,
if
at
common
law
an
individual
committed
the
petty
offense
of
window-breaking.
if
that
individual
committed
the
petty
offense
of
breaking
two
windows,
by
the
same
token,
that
case
jurisdictionally
would
be
assigned
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
to
be
tried
without
a
jury.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
yes,
i
believe
the
justice
of
the
peace
would
have
authority
to
send
an
individual
up
to
prison
for
a
period
of
time.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
we
do
have
cases
where
the
justices
of
the
peace
aggregated
offenses
in
the
king
v.
swallows
and
queen
v.
mathews.
both
those
cases
dealt
with
aggregated
offenses
tried
before
the
justices
of
the
peace,
and
those
were
cases
that--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--those
were
assigned
cases.
they
were
not
terms
of
incarceration
cases.
we
don't
have
cases
showing
aggregation
of
incarceration.
the
petitioners
also
have
been
unable
to
cite
any
cases
were
any
aggregate
term
of
imprisonment
rendered
the
case
non...
ineligible
for
trial,
a
nonjury
trial
before
the
justice
of
the
peace,
so
to
that
extent
all
we
have
is
those
cumulation
cases
in
the
file.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
it
doesn't
assume
that
so
much
as
highlight
the
focus
on
not
what
the
rules
and
the
prosecutor
and
the
court
do
in
framing
a
particular
prosecution,
but
that
the
focus
has
always
been
on
what
the
legislature
does,
and
the
legislature
doesn't
and
cannot
address
the
various
offenses
that
might
be
grouped
together
in
a
particular
prosecution
or
might
not.
alternatively,
we've
argued
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
does
believe
that
the
total
aggregate
sentence
faced
by
an
individual
in
a
particular
prosecution
is
relevant,
that
the
codispoti
model
applies,
and
that
here,
the
fact
that
the
magistrate
judge
stipulated
before
trial
that
the
defendant
would
not
be
sentenced
to
a
sentence
greater
than
6
months
and,
in
fact,
the
sentence
imposed
here
was
a
sentence
that
did
not
include
imprisonment,
defeats
any
jury-trial
right
that
petitioner
might
have
had
under
that
theory.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
we
don't
think--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--we
don't
think
it
makes
a
constitutional
difference
whether
the
ultimate
sentence
is
less
than
6
months
or
whether
the
promise
at
the
outset
of
trial--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that's
right.
i
mean,
the
bottom
line
is
that
where
the
actual
sentence
imposed
is
less
than
6
months,
under
the
codispoti
model,
whether
you
have
a
pretrial
promise
or
not,
whether
there's
ambiguous
language
at
the
beginning
of
trial
or
not,
when
the
actual
sentence
is
less
than
6
months
on
a
cumulated
petty
offense
trial,
that
there's
no
violation
of
a
jury
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
right.
under
our
principal
argument--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
the
premise
of
the
aggregation
theory
is
that
the
accused
has
a
right
to
interpose
a
jury
between
himself
and
a
possible
prison
term
of
6
months
arising
out
of
a
single
proceeding,
but
it
requires
in
order
even
to
reach
that
question
that
you're
looking
at
an
actual
result
for
the
individual
defendant.
and
so
the
bottom
line
is
that
if
a
case
is
tried
to
a
judge
without
a
jury,
a
multiple
petty
offense
case,
no
sentence
in
excess
of
6
months
may
validly
be
imposed
under
this
theory,
and
justice
scalia
is
right
to
point
out
this
is
an
alternative
theory.
we
believe
that
as
long
as
all
the
petty
offenses
in
a
particular
prosecution
are,
in
fact,
legislatively
determined
to
be
petty,
that
no
jury
right
attaches
in
that
situation,
but
if
you
disagree
with
that,
and
believe
that
our
aggregation
model
applies,
it
follows
from
that
aggregation
model
that
the
actual
limitation
in
this
case
of
the
sentence
to
6
months
should
obviate
any
jury-right
problem.
there's
an
inherent
tension
within
petitioner's
position
between
its...
between
petitioner's
reliance
on
the
prosecution
as
the
unit
and
on
section
3584
as
the
legislative
determination
whether
that
unit
is
serious.
as
i
mentioned
before,
congress
has
not
and
does
not
speak
to
prosecutions.
congress
speaks
to
individual
offenses,
and
all
petitioner
can
point
to
to
say
there's
a
legislative
determination
regarding
the
seriousness
of
a
prosecution
as
a
whole
is
the
statute
3584,
but
that
statute
speaks
equally
to
offenses
that
are
not
encompassed
within
a
single
prosecution.
in
view
of
this
court's
established
analysis
and
its
common
law
antecedents,
the
only
sensible
way
to
make
jury
trial
determinations
is
to
make
them
on
an
offense-specific
basis
with
reference
to
the
legislature's
determination
of
penalty
within
the
definition
of
the
particular
offense
itself.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
really
don't
have
anything
systematic,
justice
stevens.
i've
spoken
to
prosecutors
in
the
district
of
columbia
who
prosecute
under
local
law,
and
in
their
experience
a
substantial
portion...
this
is
very
rough,
anecdotal...
in
the
range
of
perhaps
30
percent
of
the
prosecutions
are
multiple
petty
offense
prosecutions.
it's
also
worth
noting
that
it's
extremely
rare
that
individuals,
even
in
multipetty
offense
prosecutions,
receive
a
term
of
incarceration
as
part
of
the
sentence.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
