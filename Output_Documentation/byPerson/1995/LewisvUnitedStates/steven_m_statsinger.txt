mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
requiring
jury
trials
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
framers
made
a
lasting
statement
about
the
structure
of
government
and
the
balance
of
political
power.
in
cases
where
the
threat
to
liberty
is
dire,
the
power
to
convict
does
not
belong
to
the
state,
it
belongs
to
the
people
themselves.
the
framers
regarded
the
jury
trial
as
such
a
potent
instrument
against
government
oppression
that
they
included
the
guarantee
in
the
constitution
not
once,
but
twice.
these
bedrock
political
values,
the
plain
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee,
and
this
court's
decisions
construing
the
sixth
amendment,
all
point
toward
a
single
conclusion.
my
client,
who
faced
1
year
in
prison
on
the
two
counts
in
which
he
was
tried,
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
that
is
correct,
justice
ginburg...
ginsburg.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
i
disagree
with
that,
with
all
respect,
justice
souter.
the
reason
is
that
in
the
first
place
it
strikes
us
as
very
unlikely
that
the
government
would
seek
to
sever
counts
in
order
to
circumvent
this
rule.
the
reason
is
that...
for
that
is
that
the
government
derives
a
benefit
from
joining
counts,
and
has
every
incentive
to
join
them
and
not
to
sever
them.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
i
continue
to
disagree
with
that
view.
i
think
that
the
value
to
the
prosecution
of
joining
counts
would
outweigh
those
concerns,
because
the
government
would
get
not
only
the
administrative
convenience
of
a
single
proceeding,
but
it
also
does
derive
a
tactical
advantage
from
joining
the
counts
in
the
first
place.
the
finder
of
fact
gets
to
hear
evidence
that
the
defendant
is,
in
essence,
a
worse
defendant,
because
he
or
she
has
committed
more
than
one
offense,
and
there's
also
the
possibility
of
some
sort
of
spillover
that
might
bolster
some
of
the
weaker
counts.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
i
am
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
the
extent
necessary,
we
believe
that
the
due
process
clause
might
give
sufficient
protection
to
protect
against
that
kind
of
abuse.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
no,
you
cannot,
justice
souter.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
the
two
positions
are
entirely
consistent,
justice
souter,
for
this
reason--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
with
that
proposition
i
agree.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
justice
scalia,
the
two
propositions
are
not
in
conflict,
and
the
reason
is
because
the
way
this
court
has
defined
criminal
seriousness
for
jury
trial
purposes
is
by
looking
at
the
authorized
penalty
regardless
of
whether
it's
the
authorized
penalty
for
a
single
serious
offense
or
for
the
aggregate
authorized
penalty
of
petty
offenses.
once
a
case
is
serious,
it
is
serious
in
the
same
away,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
serious
by
virtue
of
aggregation
or
serious
because
of
the
authorized
penalty
on
a
single--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--that
is
a
component
of
this
as
well.
even
if
the
judge
promises
a
lenient
sentence
as
a
result,
in
order
to
extinguish
the
jury
trial,
the
defendant
is
still
left
with
the
possibility
of
the
conviction
on
more
than
one
count,
which
itself
carries
not
only
a
stigma
but
other
collateral
consequences,
and
indeed,
it
appears
that
the
core
of
the
jury-trial
right
was
protection
against
the
conviction
power,
and
that
there
was
less
concern
per
se
about
the
sentencing
power.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
the
important
distinction
between
the
court's
prior
cases
and
this
case
was
that
in
each
of
those
cases
the
defendant
was
only
being
tried
on
a
single
count,
so
in
a
sense
the
question
never
arose
in
those
cases,
but
it
is
our
position
that--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--it
may
not
be
a
lot,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
believe
that
there
is
some,
and
i...
again,
i...
this
is
not
our
exclusive
justification
for
this.
we
believe
there
are
other
justifications
for
allowing
this.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
well,
we
are
left
with
the
stigma,
and
we
are
left
with
the
possibility
of
an
unfair
or
an
unjust
conviction
in
the
first
place.
the
reason
why
this
court
has,
and
the
framers
have
always
preferred
jury
trial
is
because
they
were
viewed
as
the
fairest
mechanism
for
adjudicating
the
facts
in
a
criminal
case,
and
a
defendant
who
comes
before
a
court
could
reasonably
view
a
jury
trial,
even
today,
as
being
a
fairer
proceeding
than
a
bench
trial.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
the
court...
the
court
did
that
for
two
reasons.
it
looked
back
at
common
law
history
and
found
that
there
was
a
historical
basis
for
saying
that
a
trial
on
a
single
petty
offense
could
be
tried
without
a
jury.
there
also
appears
to
be,
particularly
in
duncan,
some
concern
about
the
administrative
convenience,
the
balance
between
administrative
convenience
and
the
possible
threat
to
a
defendant,
but
again,
that
balance
was
struck
in
cases
where
the
defendant
was
only
being
tried
on
a
single
count,
and
that
balance
has
been
struck
only
in
cases
where
the
defendant's
sentencing
consequences
are
6
months
or
less.
and
in
this
case
the
balance
is
tipped
in
the
other
direction
because
the
sentencing
consequences...
regardless
of
the
promise,
the
sentencing
consequences
at
the
beginning
are...
were
well
in
excess
of
6
months.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
i
say
that
because
the
relevant
measure
of
criminal
seriousness
has
always
been
what
is
authorized
rather
than
what
is
actually
imposed.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
perhaps
i
used
the
term
injudiciously.
the
court
has
always
focused
more
on
the
authorized
sentence
rather
than
the
likely
or
possible
sentence,
or,
indeed,
even
the
actual
sentence
imposed
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
justice
scalia,
the
legislative
judgment
that
we
are
discussing
is
embodied
in
section
3584(a),
which
authorizes
consecutive
sentences
on
multiple
counts.
it
is
our
view
that
that
statute
confers
a
substantive
authority
on
the
court
to
impose--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--consecutive
sentences,
and
that
it
reflects
a
judgment
that
the
commission
of
multiple
offenses
is
a
more
serious
transgression
than
the
commission
of
a
single
offense.
indeed,
it
is
the
same
judgment
that
goes
into
authorizing
a...
the
particular
penalty
for
any
single
offense.
in
either
case,
what
the
legislature
is
doing
is
it
is
setting
the
maximum
penalty
for
the
worst
possible
instance
of
that
offense.
the
maximum
penalty
for
a
single
offense
represents
the
authorized
consequences
in
the
worst
possible
case.
similarly,
the
authorized
sentence
for
multiple
offenses
authorizes
a
particular
sentence
for
the
worst
possible
instance
of
that
combination
of
offenses.
so
it
is
our
view
that
the
judgment
embodied
in
that
statute
is
identical
to
the
judgment
that
the
court
has
always
looked
to,
or
at
least
since
duncan
has
always
looked
to
in
determining
criminal
seriousness.
i
believe
that
this
is
also
consistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
itself.
although
the
government
takes
the
view
that
the
jury-trial
right
is
what
they
call
offense-specific,
or
attaches
only
to
categories
of
offenses,
that
is
not
borne
out
by
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment,
which
says
that
the
right
attaches
in
all
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
i
don't
think
it
is
a
standing
question.
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
we
view
the
likelihood
of
an
increased
sentence,
assuming
he
were
convicted
on
retrial,
as
very
slim,
and
the
north
carolina
v.
pierce
line
of
cases
we
think
protects
mr.
lewis
from
a
more
severe
sentence
should
the
case
be
retried
and
should
the
retrial
end
in
a
conviction.
but
the
jury-trial
right
has
always
been
viewed
as
a
structural
right,
or
an
absolute
right,
that
is
not
contingent
or
affected
by
the
sentence
actually
imposed.
certainly
the
defendant
in
duncan,
who
received
60
days
when
he
was
facing
2
years,
must
have
made
that
same
calculus,
and
made
the
decision
that
the
core
importance
of
having
a
jury
determine
guilt
or
innocence
in
the
first
instance
was
more
important,
and
certainly--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--i
don't
believe
it
was
the
case--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--in
this
case.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
the
answer,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
this
would
not
be
a
burdensome
rule.
we
did
look
at
statistics
that
were
compiled
by
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
courts,
which
indicated
that
in
fiscal
1994
the
federal
courts
heard
an
enormous
number
of
petty
cases,
over
60,000.
of
those
60-odd
thousand,
exactly
74
went
to
trial,
and
of
those
74,
perhaps
15
involved
multiple
counts.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
have
looked
at
that
as
well.
one
of
my
amici
has
indicated
that
their
research
indicates
that
at
least
30
states
already
grant,
either
by
statute
or
state
constitution,
a
jury-trial
right
that
is
broader
than
what
the
sixth
amendment
requires.
my
own
research
indicates
that
the
number
is
more
like
34,
so
we
are,
in
fact,
talking
about
a
very
small
number
of
states
to
begin
with.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
roughly
17
or
20,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
might
add
that
i
think
the
real
instance
where
that
burden
was
looked
at
and
rejected
was
in
duncan,
when
the
court
applied
the
jury-trial
right
to
the
states
in
the
first
place.
i
think
that
the
balance
struck
then
was
the
appropriate
one,
and
that
there
certainly
has...
nothing
had
been
changed
in
the
last
30
or
so
years
to
indicate
that
the
balance
should
now
be
weighted
in
favor
of
administrative--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--i
agree
that
it
is
a
fair
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
the
question
is
that
it
will
not
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
states.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
even
if
it
is,
justice
kennedy,
the
possible
consequences
to
a
defendant
who
has
a
large
number
of
6-month
offenses
stacked
up
are
severe
indeed,
so
severe
we
believe
as
to
trigger
what
the
sixth
amendment
was
intended
to
do,
which
is
to
protect
defendants
who
are
facing
serious
consequences
from
the
potential
abuse
of
power
that
the
framers
saw
in
a
bench
trial.
so
even
if
it
is
a...
even
if
it
is
a
large
number
of
cases,
which
i
dispute,
i
submit
that
the
sixth
amendment
values
that
that
situation
implicates
are
in
this
case
more
important.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
i
don't
need
to
argue
that,
justice
stevens--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--but
it
may
well
be
right,
certainly
with
respect
to
what
the
sixth
amendment
really
means
and
the
core
values
that
it
contains,
a
society
in
which
large
numbers
of
defendants
are
subject
to
many
years...
and
the
government
would
concede
that
there's
no
limit,
potentially
unlimited
exposure...
that
those
are
exactly
the
kinds
of
cases
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
supposed
to
cover,
and
that--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--i
do
agree
with
that,
and
again,
i
say
so
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the...
and
i
say
this
with
all
respect,
the
core
value
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
protect
defendants
from
judges,
and
i
think
it
would
be
contrary
to
what
the
framers
envisioned
in
the
sixth
amendment
if
judges
could
single-handedly
or
unilaterally
take
away
or
remove
the
power
that
was
supposed
to
curb
that
power
in
the
first
place.
i
also...
so
that
really
is
our
primary
point
of
view
on
that,
and
i
think
that
the
record
in
this
case
actually
serves
as
a
good
illustration
of
the
dangers
of
allowing
it.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
a
lengthy
argument
about
the
legalities
of
trying
this
case
without
a
jury,
but
no
mention
at
all
of
the
seriousness
of
the
case,
and
it
is
plain
from
this
record
that
the
pretrial
promise
here
was
simply
a
manifestation
of
the
magistrate's
desire
to
try
this
case
without
a
jury.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
the
precise
evil
that
the
framers
were
concerned
about
when
they
insisted
on
the
wide
use
of
jury
trials
to
begin
with.
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
preliminary
question
of
the
authorities
suggesting
that
this
case
was,
indeed,
a
serious
case
and
worthy
of
a
jury
trial
to
begin
with,
and
i
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
codispoti
is
really
on
all
fours
with
this
situation.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
there
was
no
limit
on
the
sentence
for
contempt.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
on
all
fours
on
the
preliminary
question
of
whether
the
prosecution
was
serious
enough
to
trigger
the
jury-trial
right
in
the
first
place.
in
that
case,
the
court
concluded
that
a
trial
on
joint
petty
counts,
in
that
case
contempt
counts,
was
a
serious
one
when
the
aggregate
penalty,
petty
penalties
exceeded
39
months,
and
i
don't
think
that
there
can
be
a
meaningful
distinction
between
codispoti
and
what
was
happening
here
in
terms
of
the
preliminary
question
of
whether
the
case
was
serious.
it
is
true
that
the
codispoti
decision
did
not
involve
a
pretrial
sentencing
stipulation--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--it
does,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
actual
sentencing
decision
in
a
contempt
case
represents
the
identical
judgment
to
the
legislative
judgment
in
a
statutory
offense
case,
so
it
is
our
view
that
in
a
sense
the
court
has
turned
to
the
sentence
imposed,
actually
imposed
in
contempt
cases
as
a
substitute
for
the
legislator's
judgment,
but
the
court
has
always
viewed
them
as
equivalents.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
oh,
yes.
our
position
is
that
a
series
of
six
amendments,
when...
6-month
counts,
when
joined,
triggers
a
jury
trial.
when
they
are
tried
separately,
they
do
not,
because
if
each
individual
trial
on
a
single
petty
offense
falls
outside
of
the
sixth
amendment,
then
any
individual
one
does.
moving
back
to
the
pretrial
sentencing
stipulation
again,
there
is
a
secondary
reason
besides
the
policy
behind
the
sixth
amendment
that
i
think
indicates
that
such
a
stipulation
procedure
should
not
be
authorized
in
this
case,
and
the
reason
is
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions
that
have
refused
to
hold
that
the
sentence
actually
imposed
can
deprive
someone
of
a
jury
trial.
the
relevant
question
is,
and
always
has
been,
whether
a
serious
sentence
was
authorized
by
the
legislature,
and
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
a
judge
cannot
trump
that
view
of
seriousness,
and
in
fact
the
court
has
had
many
opportunities
to
look
at
this
rule
and
has
never
changed
it.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
well,
the
court...
certainly
the
court
has
never
held
that
in
the
context
of
statutory
offenses,
even
though
it
has
in
the
context
of
contempt
cases,
and
i
think
one
problem
with
that
is
that
it
would
have
the,
in
a
sense,
perverse
result
of
granting
a
broader
sixth
amendment
right
to
contempt
cases
than
for
statutory
offense
cases.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
because
the
contempt
cases
where
the
counts
were...
the
contempt
cases
where
the
counts
were
stacked
would
always
trigger
a
jury-trial
right
unless
there
was
such
a
promise.
mr.
steven
m.

i
see
your
point,
justice
breyer.
again,
we
continue
to
believe
that
the
constitutional
provision
at
issue
here
has
never
operated,
and
has...
has
never
operated
on...
by
looking
at
or
considering
the
sentence
actually
imposed
or
to
be
imposed.
it
has
always
looked
in
a
more
general
sense
at
the
authorized
penalty.
i'm
not
sure
how
that
rule
could
be
squared--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--aside
from
that,
i'm
not
sure
how
that
rule
could
be
squared
with
a
rule
that
would
say,
in
any
case,
whether
it
be
for
a
felony
or
a
string
of
misdemeanors--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--that
is
an
excellent
response
to
that.
[laughter]
i
may
do
that.
and
it
was
a
response
to
that
that
was
developed
by
considerably
wiser
individuals
than
me
who
were
very,
very
concerned
not
only
with
the
sentencing
consequences
but
with
the
power
to
convict.
and
that
rule,
while
providing
a
measure
of
security
to
defendants,
does
not
change
the
core
value,
the
possibility
of
the
abuse
of
state
power,
the
possibility
of
a
conviction
that
is
itself
unfair
or
unjust
because
the
common
sense
and...
the
common
sense
community
values
and
the
impartiality
of
the
jury
wasn't
brought
into
the
case
in
the
first
place.
and
i
think
it's
relevant
to
note
at
this
point
that,
although
the
court
has
not
decided
a
very
large
number
of
cases
in
this
area,
it
has
approved
of
bench
trials
either
implicitly
or
explicitly
in
a
number
of
them,
but
a
significant
number
of
those
cases,
even
though
the
court
approved
of
the
bench
trial,
the
court
reversed
because
the
proceeding
itself
was
unfair
for
some
other
reason.
and
i
think
that
in
a
sense
speaks
to
this
particular
concern,
that
the
court
has
always
viewed
jury
trials
as
better,
a
fairer
way
of
adjudicating
the
facts
in
criminal
cases,
and--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--of
course
he
can,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
only
pointed
that
out
in
the
general
sense
of
marshalling
this
court's
position
that
it
does
view
jury
trials
as
fairer,
and
it
does,
in
a
sense,
force
the
parties
to
do
a
more
complete
job
and
to
make
sure
that
a
judge
does
what
is
necessary
so
that
the
jury
can
understand
the
evidence.
that
would
be
our
position
with
respect
to
that.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
did
not
get
an
opportunity
to
address
our
view
of
the
common
law
procedures
in
this
area,
and
i
did
want
to
take
a
moment
to
address
them,
since
it
is
our
position
that
to
the
extent
there
is
any
evidence
of
common
law
practice
in
this
area
at
all,
it
does
not
support
the
government's
position.
the
government
has
produced
no
historical
evidence
that
a
common
law
court
of
summary
jurisdiction
could
exceed
its
jurisdictional
limits
simply
by
virtue
of
the
joinder
of
petty
offenses,
yet
that
is
what
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
permit
now.
since
baldwin,
there
has
been
a
jurisdictional
limit
on
the
triability
of
bench
trials
to
6
months,
and
the
government
is
asking
the
court
to
allow
joinder
to
exceed
that
jurisdictional
limit
in
a
way
that
was
never
approved
of
or
contemplated
at
common
law.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
it
is
our
understanding
that...
at
least,
it
is
now
widely
accepted
historically
that
common
law
justices
did
have
the
power
to
send
people
to
the
local
jail
but
not
to
prison.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
that's...
we
don't
have
a
rough
sense
of
the
exact
years,
but
i
think
at
this
point--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--right.
i
under--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--we
would
be
willing
to
accept
that
there
was
the
authority,
even
before--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--we
do
not,
justice
souter.
what
it
is
safe
to
say
is
that
even
assuming
there
was
that
authority,
and
that
we
assume
that
as
a
general
framework
common
law
summary
courts
could
incarcerate
people
for
no
more
than
6
months,
they
couldn't
get
around
that
by
virtue
of
joinder,
so
to
the
extent
there
is
a
common
law
basis
to
this
argument
at
all--
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
--we
don't
have
cases,
justice
o'connor,
we
have
an
absence
of
cases
suggesting
that
the
procedure
didn't
exist.
it
is
our
view
that
if
the
government
is
going
to
invoke
the
common
law,
it
has
the
burden
of
establishing
common
law
principles
that
are...
were
widely
enough
accepted
to
be
assumed
into
the
sixth
amendment,
and
we
don't
see
any
such
common
law
practices
that
would
support
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
oh,
i
consider
that
extremely
relevant,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
could
conceivably
be
an
independent
ground
for
determining
that
this
case
should
have
been
tried
by
a
jury
in
the
first
place.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
completely
abandoned
the
notion
that
even
a
single
offense,
even
if
only
a
petty
sentence
is
authorized,
that
even
a
single
offense,
if
it
were
serious
at
common
law
and
can
be
easily
established
as
such,
i
think
that
there's
still
an
opening,
even
in
blandon,
that
a
situation
such
as
that
would
result
in
a
jury
trial.
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
if
that
were
a
legislative
determination?
mr.
steven
m.
statsinger
well,
consistent
with
our
view
that
it
is
the
legislative
judgment
that
is
paramount,
we
would
have
to
defer
to
the
legislative
judgment
and
conclude
that
in
that
circumstance
there
would
be
no
jury
trial.
thank
you,
your
honor.
