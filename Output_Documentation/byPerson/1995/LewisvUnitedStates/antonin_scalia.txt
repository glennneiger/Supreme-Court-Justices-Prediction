mr.
statsinger,
how
does
your...
how
does
the
rule
you're
urging
square
with
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
avoid
jury
trial
requirement
by
committing
that
you
will
not
ask
for
a
sentence
of
more
than
6
months?
i
mean,
can
the
prosecution,
by
making
that
commitment
and
the
judge,
by
saying
at
the
outset,
i...
it
is
understood
that
whatever...
eve
if
the
defendant
is
found
guilty
he
will
not
be
sentenced
by
more
than
6
months,
can
you
eliminate
the
jury
trial
by
doing
just
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
would
that
be
consistent
with
the
rule
that
you're
urging
here?
it
seems
to
me
what
it
means
is,
by
subtracting
you
can't
avoid
the
jury
trial.
why,
by
adding,
should
you
require
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
souter,
i'm
scalia.
justice
antonin
scalia
our
jurisprudence
is
very
similar.
i
can
understand...
i
can
understand--
[laughter]
since
your
questioning
is
similar,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
reason
for
that
was,
as
we've
said
in
recent
cases,
the
judiciary
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
as
to
seriousness
for
that
of
a
legislature,
which
is
far
better
equipped
to
perform
the
task.
now,
when
you
string
together
a
bunch
of
offenses,
each
of
which
the
legislature
has
found
to
be
not
serious
because
the
sentence
is
under
6
months,
how
does
that
create
a
new
legislative
judgment
that
this
case
is
now
serious?
it
doesn't.
it
seems
to
me
the
legislative
judgment
remains
the
same,
no
matter
how
many
legislated
crimes
you
string
together.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
cases
where
justices
of
the
peace
aggregated
offenses
where
you
had
multiple
counts?
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
say
that
there
wouldn't
be
even
if
was
more
than
6
months,
so
long
as
it
just
accumulates
offenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even...
you'd
say
even
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
at
least
where
the
ultimate
sentence
is
no
more
than
6
months,
the
defendant
can
have
no
complaint.
