why
is--
--and
you
think
the
vacatur
erases,
washes
off
that
stigma?
this
is
not
formalism?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
walking
around
in
the
community
with
two
convictions
instead
of
one
conviction
and
a
conviction
plus
vacatur.
that's
the
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
not
formalism.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
we
do
in
the
present
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
be
vacated.
which
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
before
you
do
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
what
you
said
about
the
state
case.
why
is
it
okay
to
send
it
to
the
jury?
you
say
no
harm
is
done
if
you...
so
long
as
there's
an
instruction
at
the
end.
what
if,
in
fact,
you
know,
the
jury
convicts
of
aggravated
assault,
and
it
turns
out,
on
appeal,
that
there's
not
enough
evidence
to
support
the
aggravation
part?
if
the
lesser
included
offenses
have
not
been
submitted
to
the
jury,
he
walks,
i
assume,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
before
retrial,
i'm
sure...
he
can
be
retried.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
submit
both
to
the
jury
so
that
if
the
one
conviction
is
reversed,
the
other
one
would
stand,
as
your
argument
would
be
the
case
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
we
resolve
jeffers
the
way
we
did
against
the
government
and
not
reach
this
issue,
as
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
it
very
relevant
to
congress'
intent
whether
the
two...
whether
one
crime
is
a
lesser
included
offense
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
we
say
in
jeffers
that
we
were
not
reaching
this
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
very,
very
fine
congressional
intent
you're
asking
us
to
posit.
i
don't
like
talking
about
congressional
intent
anyway.
it
seems
to
me
you
look
at
the
statute
and
see
what
the
statute
reasonably
means,
but
you
say
there's
one
class...
we
can
discern
a
congressional
intent
not
to
pyramid
punishments,
however,
to
cumulate
convictions.
so
there
are
three
categories
of
statutes.
you
can
cumulate
both,
and
then,
category
two,
you
can
pyramid
punishments
but
not
convictions,
and
category
three,
you
can't
pyramid
either
one,
and
we're
to
discern
this
refined
congressional
intent
statute
by
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
real
difficult
task,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
the
one
goes
with
the
other.
i
think
when
congress
doesn't
intend
to
pyramid
punishments,
it
doesn't
intend
to
pyramid
convictions,
either.
that's
my
point.
i
think
it's
a
very
refined
congressional
intent
to
allow
the
double
punishment
but
not
allow
the
double
conviction,
or
vice
versa--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
there
are
even
more
than
three
categories.
maybe
sometimes
they
want
to
allow
two
convictions
but
not
two
punishments.
sometimes
they
want
to
allow
two
punishments
but
not
two
convictions.
we
re
going
to
have
to
go
through
the
whole
list,
aren't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
life
is
too
short.
we
can't
figure
all
of
this
out.
i
mean,
if
it's...
the
two
are
cumulated
or
not,
and
if
they're
cumulated,
you
can
neither
punish
twice
nor
you
can
convict
twice.
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it's
a
lesser
punishment
to
say
i
was...
i
have
two
convictions
of
two
crimes,
than
to
say
i
have
one
conviction
of
two
crimes?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
that
said
in
ball
that
two
convictions
are
punishment,
you
know,
is
cumulative
punishment
would
also
say
that
a
conviction
of
two
crimes
is
cumulative
punishment,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it's
stigmatically
neutral,
is
that
it?
