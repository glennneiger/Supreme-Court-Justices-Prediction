chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-8769,
tommy
l.
rutledge
v.
united
states.
mr.
levenstam.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
really
means
there
isn't
any
constitutional
question
involved,
if
congress
can
provide
whatever
it
wants,
and
double
jeopardy
accordingly
recedes
whatever
congress
has
provided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
would
have
to
appeal
that,
though,
to
get
the
vacatur
reversed,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
the
defendant
isn't
going
to
say,
reverse
the
vacatur.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
then
does
your
client
appeal
again
from
the
second
judgment,
so
that
can
be
reviewed
for
possible
error?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
doesn't...
wouldn't
your
client
have
a
right
to
claim
some
sort
of
error,
perhaps
in
the
instructions,
in
the
case
of
the
judgment
that's
now
been
entered
against
him?
you
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
argue
that
on
the
previous
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
levenstam.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
source
of
this
refined
concept
of
punishment
that
you
were
just
talking
about?
are
there
cases
from
this
court
that
suggest
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
isn't
entirely
consistent
with
some
of
our
other
cases,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
lot
of
that
has
to
be
implied
from
tinder,
doesn't
it,
since
it
really
goes
from
a
long
recitation
of
the
facts
to
saying,
reversed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
of
this
is--
--as
one
who
joined
the
convoluted--
[laughter]
--i
must
say,
when
i...
when
the
opinion
says
we
assume
something,
i
don't
figure
we're
deciding
it,
i
figure
we're
reserving
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
enters
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
an
offense
which
the
defendant
was
not
convicted
of
by
the
jury
because
the
jury
very
likely
would
have
convicted
him
on--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levenstam,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
levenstam.
the
case
is
submitted.
