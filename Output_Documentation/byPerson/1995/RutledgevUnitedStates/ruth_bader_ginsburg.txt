but
then
if
we're
concerned
with
congress'
intent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
you
agree,
then
why
would
congress
intend
to
put
the
prosecutor
at
risk
of
having
no
conviction...
let's
say
the
cce
conviction
gets
wiped
out
on
appeal...
if
the
conspiracy
conviction
has
not
been
entered?
why
would
we
attribute
such
a
will
to
congress?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
that
work
if
there
is
no
judgment
entered
on
the
conspiracy
count?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
merge...
you've
just
used
a
word
that
the
second
circuit...
what
you
describe
seems
to
be
what
the
second
circuit's
position
is,
and
yet
in
your
brief
you
reject
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
this
all
just
formalism
if
your
end
result
is
that
the
court
on
appeal
could
reinstate
the
verdict
on
the
conspiracy
count
in
the
event
that
the
cce
conviction
were
reversed
on
a
ground
peculiar
to
that
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
vacatur.
no
judgment
was
ever
entered
on
it.
that's
what
you
say
was
the
appropriate
thing.
you
said
the
district
judge
should
convict
on
only
one
count.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
vacate
it...
the
jury's
verdict.
you
just
don't
enter
judgment
on
it,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
sense
does
it
make?
if
you
say
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
retrial
on
the
conspiracy,
why
have
two
appeals
instead
of
just
one?
as
long
as
there's
not
going
to
be
additional
collateral
consequences,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
doesn't
it
make
entire
sense
to
let
the
whole
case
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
just
ensure
that
there
will
be
no
more
than
one
punishment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it's
so
that
under
that
seventh
circuit
judgment
there
is
no
greater
exposure
to
recidivist
charges
because
under
the
guidelines
they
would
be
treated
the
same
as
if
there'd
been
only
a
cce
conviction,
so
that
there
is
no
recidivist
consequence,
then
under
the
seventh
circuit
decision,
when
there's
no
longer
a
prison
term,
the
only
consequence
is
the
extra
stigma.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
raise
that
in
connection
with
your
client?
how
many
convictions
does
your
client
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
were,
indeed,
three
life
sentences,
were
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
does...
the
way
this
particular
case
is
decided,
does
it
have
any
practical
consequences,
given
that
your
client
has
not
two,
but
three
life
sentences
at
the
moment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in...
ball
you
say
was
lesser
included?
i
thought
that
they
were
so
close
to
the
same
offense,
why
would...
why
do
you
characterize
those
as
lesser,
possession
as
lesser
included?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
feldman,
chief
justice
burger
said,
twice
in
that
opinion
said
the
criminal
conviction
itself,
and
not
just
the
sentence,
is
punishment,
and
he
stated
that...
i'm
sure
you're
familiar
with
the
decision...
twice
as
a
perfectly
general
proposition
not
tied
to
this
peculiar
receipt
possession.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
tinder
case
that
you
cited,
if
that's
the
model,
then
the
government
is
protected
against
what
you
said
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
was
your
real
concern.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
you'd
be
stuck
without
any
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
you
recognize--
--but
the
precedent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me--
--ball
could
be
read
to
say
just
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ball
could
be
read
to
say
just
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
very
conviction
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--an
additional
punishment,
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
the
stigma.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
levenstam,
what
is
your
position
on
the
tinder
approach?
that
is,
cce,
only
conviction,
appellate
court
can
remand
with
instructions
to
enter
a
conviction
on
the
conspiracy
count?
