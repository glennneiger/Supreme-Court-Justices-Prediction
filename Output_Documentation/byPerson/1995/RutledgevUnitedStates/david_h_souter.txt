justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
there
any
additional
stigma
when
the
second
offense
is
essentially
a
lesser
included...
i
mean,
he's
already
got
all
the
stigma
he
can
get
from
the
first
one.
the
second
is
stigmatically
redundant,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
they
know
about
him
as
a
result
of
the
second
conviction
that
they
don't
know
about
him
as
a
result
of
the
first?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the...
not
all
of
the
errors
might
have
been
the
basis
for
the
decision.
let's
assume
that
on
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
count
some
element
other
than
the
conspiracy
element
was
found
to
be
insufficiently
supported
by
evidence,
and
the
court
says,
that's
enough,
we
reverse.
then
we
get
back
to
the
position
that
you
posit.
the
other
conviction,
the
conspiracy
conviction
is
brought
forward.
i
presume
at
that
point
you
would
say,
oh,
well,
i
now
want
to
appeal
this
because
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
conspiracy.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
but
just
tell
me,
why
won't
you...
i
mean,
you're
not
going
to
concede
that
on
behalf
of
your
client--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
if,
in
fact,
it
was
not
reached
by
the
appellate
court
as
the
grounds
of
its
decision
in
the
first
appeal,
you're
going
to
want
to
reach
it
in
the
second
one,
because
if
you
do,
your
client
will
walk,
so
of
course
you're
going
to
want
to
appeal
it,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
will
raise
every
issue,
but
in
my
example
the
appellate
court
says,
we
find
one
ground
of
error.
we
don't
have
to
get
into
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
on
conspiracy.
that's
difficult.
so
we're
going
to
decide
it
on
the
ground
of
the
clear
error,
and
so
you
will
have
done
everything
you're
supposed
to
do,
but
because
the
court
decided
on
the
ground
that
it
did,
you
will
still
have
the
conspiracy
issue
before
you,
and
you're
going
to
appeal
it,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
will
be...
i
mean,
we've
got
to
assume
that
the
price
to
be
paid
here
is
a
second
appeal.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
lose
on
the
stigma
point,
there
are
none,
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
if
we
say,
look,
there
is
no
cognizable
extra
stigma
when
you
have
a
mere
lesser
included
offense,
then
you
really
wouldn't
have
an
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
would
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
fifty
dollars.
justice
david
h.
souter
fifty
dollars.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
we
say
that
it's
a
lesser
included
offense,
you
get
everything
you
want,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
let's...
all
right,
let's
assume
we'll
commit
that
error,
and
we'll
say
that
congress
did
intend
these
to
be
treated
as
greater
and
lesser
included,
then
there's
nothing
else
that
you're
worried
about,
is
there?
there's
no
broader
point
that
you're
concerned--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
i
think
that
was
justice
breyer's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
feldman,
if
we
don't
make
what
you
regard
as
the
error
of
treating
this...
these
two
offenses
as
greater
and
lesser,
then,
in
fact,
there
would,
i
suppose
be
a
further
stigmatic
element
quite
apart
from
the
$50
in
the
conviction
for
conspiracy,
since
that
need
not
be
on
your
view
assumed
under
ccc,
and
so
if
we
read
the
law
right,
why
shouldn't
you
lose
just
on
straightforward
analysis
of
cumulative
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
levenstam,
may
i...
i'm
sorry,
but
would
you
address...
i
was
going
to
ask
mr.
feldman
this.
what's
the
significance
of
the
$50
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
$50,
at
least
in
your
view,
is
punishment.
it's
not
some
administratively
neutral
user
fee
for
being
sentenced,
or
something
like
that?
