or

three-strikes-and-you're-out
law
in

state.

i
assume
if
there
are
two
convictions,
rather
than
a
merged
one
it
would
count
for
two,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
did
this
court
say
in
ball
that
sheds
light
on
this,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
ball
indicate
that
the
conspiracy
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
cce,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
that's
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
jeffers
where
we
discussed--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes,
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
plurality
in
jeffers
assumed
without
deciding
that
there
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we
should
decide
whether
this
is
a
lesser
included
offense
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
feldman,
what
light
do
you
think
that
garrett
v.
the
united
states
sheds
on
this
problem?
there,
the
court
dealt
with
what,
a
cce
offense
and
a
predicate
offense?
