mr.
barry
levenstam
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
what
limits
the
double
jeopardy
clause
places
upon
the
punishment
to
be
imposed
upon
a
defendant
found
guilty
of
violating
21
u.s.c.
section
848,
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute,
and
section
846,
the
drug
conspiracy
statute,
where
the
same
conduct
constitutes
the
conspiracy
and
the
in
concert
element
of
section
848.
mr.
barry
levenstam
the
court's
analysis
has
incorporated
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
constitution
historically.
there
have
been
cases
decided
without
reference
to
that,
and
then
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
which
rely
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes,
your
honor.
under
missouri
v.
hunter
and
a
long
line
of
cases
from
this
court,
that
is
clearly
the
case.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
the...
what
congress
intended
in
the
multiple
punishments
context
defines
the
parameters
of
the
double
jeopardy
protection.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
double
jeopardy
does
not
impose
limitations
on
congress,
it's
true.
it's
been
analyzed
to
impose
limitations
upon
the
courts
in
imposing
congress'
will.
whether
it's
actually
necessary,
given
the
presence
of
the
due
process
clause,
or
even
the
body
of
the
constitution,
relative
authority
granted
under
article
i
or
article
iii,
insofar
as
my
client
is
concerned,
he
would
be
as
happy
to
have
one
of
these
convictions
vacated
under
any
of
those
rubrics,
but
historically,
looking
at
the
cases,
they
have
analyzed
these
situations
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes.
mr.
barry
levenstam
i
don't
think
you
should
attribute
such
a
will
to
congress,
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
what
would
happen.
our
suggestion
as
to
what
should
happen
in
a
situation,
it's
clear
under
this
court's
decision
in
ball
that
the
prosecutor
is
entitled
to
charge
both,
to
present
evidence
as
to
both,
to
put
both
before
the
jury,
and
the
court
is
entitled
to
accept
a
verdict
back
from
the
jury
with
respect
to
both.
if
the
jury
comes
back
and
enters
guilty
verdicts
with
respect
to
both,
our
position
is
that
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
district
court
to
enter
a
vacatur
with
respect
to
one
or
the
other
in
that
court's
discretion,
and
then
when
the
entire
case
goes
up
on
appeal,
and
we
would
assume
that
the
defendant,
having
been
found
guilty,
would
take
an
appeal,
both
the
guilty
verdict,
the
judgment
entered
upon
the
conviction...
for
instance,
the
cce...
and
the
vacatur
that
the
district
court
entered
on
the
conspiracy
would
be
before
the
appellate
court.
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
defendant
to
argue
with
respect
to
both
of
those
counts
everything
that
he
has,
because
the
appellate
court,
having
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
case
and
all
the
orders
therein
because
the
appeal
is
from
a
final
appeal,
if
it
determined
that
the
cce
count
should
be
reversed
based
on
some
element
of
cce
or
some
aspect
of
the
case
pertaining
to
an
element
that
distinguishes
it
from
the
underlying
conspiracy,
the
appellate
court
would
have
the
authority
to
reverse
the
vacatur
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
at
the
same
time.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
there
would
be
a
final
judgment
entered
in
the
case,
and
in
the
line
on
the
judgment
form
it
would
say,
jury
verdict
vacated
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy,
and
then
the
court,
the
appellate
court
could
simply
reverse
the
vacation
of
that,
and
remand
to
the
district
court.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
the
defendant
won't
say
that.
it's
my
understanding
that
a
final
appeal,
because
all
orders
merge
in
the
final
judgment
order,
the
court
would
have
the
authority
to--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--well,
i
reject
that
because
the
second
circuit's
approach
involves
entering
judgments
of
conviction
on
two
counts
when
we
believe
under
the
ball
decision
that
judgments
of
conviction
should
be
entered
under
only
one
of
the
counts.
that,
we
believe,
is
congress'
intent,
and
that,
we
believe,
is
backed
up
by
the
force
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
barry
levenstam
perhaps
it
may
appear
to
be
formalism
from
the
standpoint
of
the
court,
but
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant
who
has
a
double
jeopardy
interest
here,
he
will
have
stood
trial
in
public,
perhaps
in
his
community,
and
under
the
second
circuit
means
of
addressing
this
issue,
he
will
have
the
additional
stigma
which
the
court
mentioned
in
ball
of
having
two
judgments
of
conviction
entered,
really
upon
one
offense.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes.
mr.
barry
levenstam
right.
he'll--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--no.
mr.
barry
levenstam
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
so.
i
think--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--because--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--that
he's
been
convicted
on
two
significant
drug
offenses,
which
are
in
fact
one
and
the
same,
that
he
has
received
two
life
sentences,
and
the
newspaper
reports
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
noted
the
number,
the
conviction
total
with
respect
to
my
client,
and
it
seems
to
me,
although
i've
been
involved
in
the
legal
system
nearly
20
years
now,
that
for
people
who
are
not,
when
they
read
the
papers
and
see
that
someone
has
received
not
one
but
two
life
sentences,
they
glean
from
that
that
he
committed
not
one
but
two
exceptionally
heinous
crimes,
and
under
a--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
barry
levenstam
i
was
simply
going
to
say,
under
congress'
definition,
based
on
our
position,
there
has
been
only
one
offense
here.
the
lesser
included
is
not
to
be
punished
separately.
it's
not
to
be
taken
as
a
separate
offense.
mr.
barry
levenstam
my
concern
with
the
suspension,
and
why
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
vacatur
is
a
more
satisfactory
solution,
is
because
suspending
the
count
sort
of
leaves
it
out
somewhere
in
never
never
land.
mr.
barry
levenstam
something
i
never
really
understood
in
law
school
myself.
[laughter]
mr.
barry
levenstam
our
request
with
respect
to
this
would
be
that
you
remand
to
the
district
court
with
the
direction
that
one
of
the
two
convictions
be
vacated.
mr.
barry
levenstam
that
would
be
up
to
the
district
court.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
both--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--but...
that
might
be
the
simplest
approach,
but
i--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--my
approach,
which
is
suggested,
i
believe,
by
ball,
is
that
the
district
court
exercise
its
discretion.
mr.
barry
levenstam
in
the
normal
course
i
believe
you
would
enter
judgment
on
the
greater
offense--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--and
vacate
the
lesser
included.
mr.
barry
levenstam
no.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
the
appellate
court
then
would
say
that
because
the
government
did
not
satisfy
the
requirements
to
establish
a
cce,
and
there
is
no
cce
conviction--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--the
vacatur
entered
on
the
conspiracy
conviction--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--and
vacate
the
jury's
verdict
on
the
other.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
i
believe
the
jury's
verdict
is,
as
a
matter
of
course,
entered
on
the
docket,
and
the
docket
entry
would
then
be
vacated.
mr.
barry
levenstam
then
the
court
of
appeals
can
say
the
decision,
given
that
there
is
no
longer
a
conviction
under
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute,
there
is
no
longer
a
double
jeopardy
bar,
and
so
we
reverse
the
vacatur
order,
and
we
remand
to
the--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--well--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--i
don't
believe
that
would
be
necessary,
but--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--okay.
mr.
barry
levenstam
i
don't
believe
that
because,
typically,
from
a
final
judgment
order,
all
orders
entered
in
the
case
are
brought
before
the
court
of
appeals,
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
would
have
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
the
vacatur
is
no
longer
valid
because
there's
no
longer
a
double
jeopardy
bar
to
the
entry
of
a
judgment
of
conviction
on
the
conspiracy,
the
lesser
included,
and
so
you
reverse
the
vacatur
and
you
remand
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
enter
judgment,
assuming
that
there
is
no
prejudice,
say,
here
as
a
result
of
the--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--they
don't
have
to
have--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--they
do
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
barry
levenstam
the...
in
the
typical
case,
and
this
has
happened,
in
25
years,
so
infrequently
that
it's...
that
it...
there
aren't
a
lot
of
examples
to
cite
to,
but
in
the
typical
case,
the
only
thing
that
the
district
court
would
do
would
be
to
enter
judgment
and
then
issue
a
sentence
and
the
only
question
really
left
for
appeal
would
be
the
propriety
of
the
sentence.
mr.
barry
levenstam
i
believe
we...
yes.
not
only
would
we
have,
but
it
would
have
been
incumbent
upon
us
to
argue
all
error.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
i
don't
think
it's
that
complicated,
because
you
have
to--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--oh,
no.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
that's
true,
but
i
will
want
to
appeal
because
the
conspiracy
claim
is
a
true,
lesser-included
offense.
i
will
want
to
raise
every
issue
with
respect
to
that,
too,
because
every--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--yes,
although
i
would
say--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--well,
yes.
at
some
level...
i
don't
think
it
will
be
that
complicated,
a
second
appeal,
because
the
same
court
that
you're
talking
about
will
have--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--well,
again,
i
guess
i
don't
agree
with
the
underlying
premise
that
there
are
no
collateral
consequences,
because
ball
clearly
recognized
the
social
stigma--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--justice
souter,
you're
absolutely
correct
with
respect
to
a
situation
other
than
the
one
that
is
in
our
case,
where
the
seventh
circuit
has
affirmed
concurrent
sentences...
concurrent
judgments,
separate
judgments
and
separate
concurrent
sentences.
in
our
case,
there
was
never
a
vacation
of
either
offense,
and
so
the
argument
to
this
point
has
been
talking
about
preferred
approach
to
take,
but
has
not
really
addressed
what's
happened
in
our
case.
in
our
case,
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
separate
convictions
and
affirmed
concurrent
sentences.
i
will--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--no,
i
disagree.
mr.
barry
levenstam
excuse
me?
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
there
is...
yes,
there
is
the
assessment
of
$50,
there
is
in
addition...
there
are
certainly
other
collateral
consequences
that
may
adhere.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
question
of
potential
future
impeachment,
and
the
fact
that
my
client
may
be
imprisoned
does
not
mean
that
he
will
not--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--yes.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes,
that
is
also
a
possibility.
there's
also
a--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--well,
depending
on
whether
you
count
both,
it
would
be
five
or
six
in
this
case.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
and
nobody
sitting
here
today
can
project
that
far
into
the
future.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
generally
in
the
state
courts,
at
least
in
illinois,
charges
aren't
made
on
a
separate
basis.
you're
charged
for
an
aggravated
battery,
for
instance,
and
the
question
would
come
up
at
the
end
of
the
case
whether
to
submit
jury
instructions
on
the
lesser
includeds
of
battery
and
assault.
mr.
barry
levenstam
i
think
the
jury...
i
believe
that
the
jury,
at
least
in
my
state,
is
instructed
to
do
one
or
the
other,
so
the
problem
does
not
come
up.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
it
would
make
sense
to
me,
but
i
believe
that
the
ball
case
said
that
a
jury
verdict,
that
you
can
bring
back...
return
a
jury
verdict
on
both.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
i
don't--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--i
don't
disagree
that
this
creates
the
problem,
is
the
situation
of
the
government
charging
both
the
lesser
and
the
greater.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes.
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
but--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--the...
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
every
continuing
criminal
enterprise
will
have
embedded
within
it
a
conspiracy,
because
one
of
the
statutory
elements,
without
looking
to
the
facts
of
the
case
or
anything,
a
pure
blackburger
analysis,
is
in
concert,
the
conduct
has
to
be
in
concert,
and
so
there
will
always
be
a
conspiracy
buried
in
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
mr.
barry
levenstam
that's
true,
and
our
position--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
last
thing
you
said.
mr.
barry
levenstam
that's
true,
but
congress
did
not
intend
for
pyramiding
sentences
here.
the
government
agrees
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
pyramiding
sentences.
the
government's
position
is--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--yes.
mr.
barry
levenstam
a
para--
[laughter]
mr.
barry
levenstam
well,
i
guess
in
my
waning
moments
perhaps
i
sort
of
leapfrogged
to
an
issue
i
was
hoping
to
get
to
address,
which
is
congress'
intent.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
barry
levenstam
my
understanding
is
that...
and
i
have
seen
cases
in
which
there
were
reversals
in
remand
for
trial
on
the
lesser
included.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes.
mr.
barry
levenstam
to
be
honest
with
you,
i
don't
know.
mr.
barry
levenstam
it's
not
how
the
illinois
law
has
evolved.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes.
mr.
barry
levenstam
the
same
was
true
with
respect
to
the...
i...
with
respect
to
the
two
firearms
statutes
involved.
they
were
separate
offenses.
they
were
both
submitted.
this
court
held
specifically
that
both
could
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
verdicts
could
be
returned.
nevertheless,
it
was
clear
that
the
possession
statute
was
a
lesser
included
of
the
receipt
statute,
and
this
court,
in
examining
the
statutory
history,
the
legislative...
the
statutory
structure
and
the
legislative
history,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
cumulate
punishment,
and
based
upon
that
conclusion
said,
because
of
the
collateral
consequences
issue,
that
you
could
not
enter
cumulative
sentences
even
if
they're
concurrent.
the
same
situation
presented
itself
in
united
states
v.
gattis,
which
is...
was
a
bank
robbery
case,
and
the
jury
returned
verdicts
under
2113(a),
2113(b),
and
2113(d),
and
this
court,
in
its
footnote,
said,
well,
obviously,
you're
going
to
have
to
vacate
the
separate
convictions
and
the
concurrent
sentences
for
all
but
the
2113(d).
so
i
think
within
the
federal
system...
perhaps
it
was
unfortunate
i
even
interjected
my
state,
but
within
the
federal
system,
it
is
not
unusual
to
submit
lesser
included
and
the
greater
offense
at
the
same
time.
mr.
barry
levenstam
because
in
order
to
receive
you
have
to
possess,
but
in
order
to
possess,
you
do
not
have
to
receive,
and
the...
chief
justice
burger
in
writing
that
case
noted
in
a
footnote
that
one
way
of
doing
that
would
be
to...
for
the
person
who
possesses
the
gun
to
manufacture
it.
you
know,
the
zap
gun
situation.
but
there
is
a
much
more
frequent
occurrence
that
distinguishes
those
two
statutes,
and
that
is,
somebody
who
is
not
a
felon
goes
out,
buys
a
gun...
it
happens
all
the
time...
commits
a
felony,
is
convicted,
and
upon
his
release
returns
home
to
his
gun
collection.
now,
every
one
of
those
guns
is
illegally
possessed,
but
not
one
of
them
was
illegally
received,
and
so
there
you
have...
that
is
the
situation.
it's
a
virtually
identical
situation
here
where
there
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
barry
levenstam
i...
well,
i
would
certainly
prefer
it
to
the
approach
taken
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case,
okay.
mr.
barry
levenstam
beyond
that,
i
still
believe,
as
i
started
out
the
morning,
that
the
vacatur
approach
is
better
because
that
way
there
is
no
question
but
that
there
is
only
one
conviction
for
one
offense.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
barry
levenstam
thank
you.
with
respect
to
the
jeffers--
mr.
barry
levenstam
--well,
under
this
court's
per
curiam
decision
in
ray,
there
really
are
no
longer
concurrent
sentences
in
the
federal
system,
because
each
judgment
of
conviction
carries
with
it
a
separate
$50
assessment.
mr.
barry
levenstam
yes.
statute
3013
says
it's
to
be
collected
as
if
it
were
a
criminal
fine,
and
this
court's
decision
in
ray
clearly
indicated
that
this
was
not
a...
there
were
no
longer
concurrent
sentences
in
the
federal
system.
with
respect
to
jeffers,
while
the
court
was
willing
to
assume
for
that
cases
the
status
of
the
conspiracy
as
a
lesser
included,
what
it
did
not
assume,
and
the
question
it
specifically
answered
was,
would
it
call
the
critical
inquiry
whether
congress
intended
to
punish
these
two
statutes
separately,
and
the
answer
there
was
no,
and
that
answer
was
not
only
shared
by
the
four
members
of
the
plurality,
but
i
believe
my
reading,
if
you
look
at
footnote
5
of
justice
stevens'
concurrence,
he
said
there
were
two
punishments
imposed
unconstitutionally
as
well,
so
eight
justices
there,
regardless
of
the
lesser
included
issue,
said
specifically
congress
did
not
intend
to
punish
violations
of
846
and
848
separately.
mr.
barry
levenstam
assuming
that
you
can
interject
the
morris
v.
mathews
analysis,
which
is,
if
there
has
been
some
prejudice
to
the
defendant
as
a
result
of
the
charging
of
the
greater
offense,
then
we
would
agree
with
that,
with
the
tinder
approach.
thank
you.
