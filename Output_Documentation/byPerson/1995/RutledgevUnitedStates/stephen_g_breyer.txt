justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what...
i
mean,
how
is
it
supposed
to
work?
that's
what
i
can't
figure
out
in
this
case.
the
judge
gets
a
piece
of
paper,
and
the
piece
of
paper
says,
judgment
on
846,
then
there's
a
blank
or
something.
i
mean,
normally
he'd
fill
in,
convicted,
all
right.
then
848,
he'd
fill
in
judgment
of
conviction.
it's
this
piece
of
paper
called
a
judgment,
and
in
your
opinion,
how
should
it
read?
after
all,
i
mean,
it
sounds
very
technical
and
very
formal.
if
he
puts
the
wrong
one
and
then
on
appeal
the
other
one's
reversed,
or
something,
you
know,
and
what
happens
when
one
party
thinks
that
they
are
lesser
included
and
the
other
doesn't?
i
mean,
isn't
the
simplest
thing
just
say,
judge,
fill
in
both,
convicted.
do
that.
just
fill
it
both
in,
convicted--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
collateral
consequences
will
take
care
of
themselves.
you
say...
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
count
it
twice,
like
recidivism
statutes,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
now
what
is
your
approach?
how
would
you...
how
would
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you
say
that.
i'm
the
district
judge,
pretend,
and
i
would
say,
since
i
haven't
that
much
experience,
i'd
ask
you,
what
do
you
want
me
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
so
i'd
enter
judgment,
848
convicted,
okay,
and
i
enter
judgment
on
846,
i
say,
strike
it
out.
do
i
say,
acquitted?
what
do
i...
i
don't
put
acquitted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
cross
it
out,
okay.
now
what
happens
is
that
you
appeal,
and
lo
and
behold
you
discover
that
the
money
wasn't
used
in
an
enterprise
or
something,
and
so
that's
reversed.
now
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
so
now
what's
supposed
to
happen,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
reverse
the...
in
other
words,
the
government
had
to
file
a
piece
of
paper
called
cross-appeal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
you
won't
care.
i
mean,
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
you're
representing
your
client.
you
won't
care.
so
what
they
were
supposed
to
do
is,
they're
supposed
to
file
a
cross-appeal
from
the
vacatur
order,
and
so
that
then
they're
protected?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
what
if...
no,
but
i
want
to
know
what's
supposed
to
happen,
so
let
me
leave
you
alone
and
you'll
tell
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
now
an
appellate
court
judge,
and
i've
just
reversed
the
848
conviction
because
of
the
lack
of
that
final
element,
and
now
i
say
to
you,
now
please
tell
me,
what
do
i
do
now?
i'm
new
at
this.
i
want
to
know
how
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
don't
have
to
have
appealed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
actually
is
your
objection
to
what
i
take
is
the
sg's
position
on
our
piece
of
paper
called
judgment
in
the
district
court?
the
district
court
would
write,
846,
conviction,
848,
conviction,
and
then
between
the
two
he'd
write
the
words,
846
is
included
as
part
of
the,
or
something
like
that.
now,
that's...
or
merged
into,
i
don't
know.
he
writes
some
extra
words
between
those
two
pieces
of
paper,
and
that
would
signal
to
everybody...
lawyers
see
the
word
conviction,
they
know
they
have
to
appeal,
so
they'd
have
a
signal,
appeal
both,
and
the
words
in
between
those
two
things
would
apparently
make
clear
to
everybody,
we'd
hope,
with
an
opinion
of
this
court,
that
the
collateral
consequences
don't
apply.
do
you
have
an
objection
to
that
approach?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
help
me
with
something
very,
very
basic?
assume
no
knowledge
on
my
part...
very
basic.
what
happens
in
the
absolute
ordinary
case
in
the
federal
courts
where
you
have
crime
a,
and
everyone
agrees
that
crime
a
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
crime
b?
now,
how
do
you
instruct
the
jury?
you
instruct
the
jury...
you
instruct
the
jury
in
the
ordinary
hornbook
basic
case
that
they
can
convict
of
both,
or
do
you
tell
the
jury
you
can
convict
of
a
only
if
you
acquit
of
b?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
latter
is
the
ordinary
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
ordinarily,
the
basic
hornbook
thing
is
that
you'll
end
up
with
one
conviction,
and
if
that
conviction
is
reversed
on
appeal,
you'll
have
to
have
a
new
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
they
convict
for
the
greater
offense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
you
if
the
jury
never
came
in
with
a
conviction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
if
you
instruct
the
jury,
jury,
convict
of
b,
if
you
convict
of
b
you
can't
convict
of
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
just
lesser
included.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
they
do
convict
of
b.
on
appeal,
reversed.
you
have
to
have
a
new
trial,
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
so,
fine.
if
that's
so,
why
does
the
government
care
if
we
adopt
their
position?
that
is,
if
it's
a
lesser-included
offense,
then
we'd
simply
behave
as
normal.
the
government
must
care
because
you're
trying
to
save
the
possibility...
what
is
it...
i
don't
understand
why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
just
explained
to
me
how
that's
impossible.
you've
just
explained
it
to
me.
you
said--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that's
a
legal
argument.
i'm
interested
in
why
you
care
about
it.
that
is,
from
what
you
just
said,
if
i
were
to
write
down
your
very
words,
and
it
turned
out
you're
right
about
how
this
is
normally
so,
and
it
also
turned
out
that
this
is
a
less
included
offense
of
a
normal
sort,
you
would
therefore,
if
i
wrote
down
your
very
words
you
just
told
me,
have
what
you
want,
isn't
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
what
we
should
say,
in
your
view,
is
almost,
i
think,
identical
to
what
your
opponent
told
us.
we
should
say,
this
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
this
is
how
the
lesser
included
offense
works,
and
then
say
what
you
said.
