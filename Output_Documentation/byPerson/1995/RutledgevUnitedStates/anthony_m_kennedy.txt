is
it
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
the
constitutional
sense,
or
simply
a
concept
that's
somewhat
like
double
jeopardy
when
we're
interpreting
congressional
intent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
all
parties
concede,
or
at
least
do
you
agree
that
if
congress
wanted
multiple
or
cumulative
punishments
set
for
the
two
crimes,
that
they
could
constitutionally
enact
a
provision
that
would
secure
that
objective?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
we're
really
talking
about
what
congress
intended,
rather
than
double
jeopardy,
are
we
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
district
court
order
that
the
lesser
offense
be
simply
suspended,
he
would
suspend
entering
judgment,
i
don't
think
that
would
work,
because
then
you
couldn't
have
both
appeals.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
sort
of
like
a
springing
use.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
is
this
a
lesser
included
offense
case?
is
this
a
lesser
included
offense
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
the
position
was
that
there
were
two
different
acts.
one
was
a
conspiracy,
the
other
was
a
very
successful
conspiracy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
necessary...
the
only
reason
it's
lesser
included
is
because
there's
a
lesser
punishment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
a
lesser...
not
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
yes,
but
we've
conceded
at
the
outset...
i
thought
we
conceded
that
they
could
be
punished
separately
and
cumulatively
if
congress
so
intended.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
not
a
paradigmatic
lesser
included
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
that
situation
you
do
not
have
a
paradigmatic
lesser
included
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
state
court
case
you
hypothesized,
that
you
explained,
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
on
only
one
of
the
two
charges,
not
both.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
here
they
do
both,
so
that's
different
from
the
standard
lesser
included
offense,
now.
the
lesser
included
offense,
the
jury
has
a
choice
of
one
or
the
other.
here,
the
government
is
entitled
to
require
a
jury
verdict
on
both.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
at
hand
authority
that
i
could
look
at?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
tinder.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that's
so,
because
in
tinder
what
happened...
i've
just
read
it...
the
court
gave
a
sentence
that
was
in
excess
of
the
authorized
sentence
unless
they
showed
that
the
value
of
the
items
stolen
from
the
mail
had
been
more
than
$5,000.
the
court
just
made
a
mistake.
there
had
been
no
proof
the
value
was
over
$5,000,
so
this
court
said,
well,
you
just
have
to
sentence
for
the
lesser
amount
because
it
wasn't
shown.
that's
all
that
was.
the
offense
was
the
same.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
sentence
could
stand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
offense
was
the
same
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
we
were
to
decide
the
case
that
way,
we
would
have...
in
order
to
reach
this
happy
result
that's
been
suggested
to
you,
i
think
we
would
have
to
confirm
the
correctness
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion
in
the
allison
case,
which
said
that
without
a
jury
verdict
on
the
lesser
included
offense,
the
court
could
order
a
judgment
on
that
defense,
and
that
that
seems--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
me
to
be
something
we
have
not
yet
decided.
