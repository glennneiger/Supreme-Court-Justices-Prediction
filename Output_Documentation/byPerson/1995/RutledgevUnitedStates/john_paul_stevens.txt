justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
kind
of
a
basic
question
that
will
reveal
my
ignorance?
this
lesser
included
offense
situation,
where
a
person
is
charged
with
a
greater
offense
and
a
lesser
in
the
same
proceeding,
that
must
happen
quite
frequently
in
the
state
courts,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
do
have
jury
instructions
for
a
greater
and
a
lesser
included
offense
in
the
same
case,
what
does
the
judge
do?
does
he
enter
two
judg...
i
mean,
what
does
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
why
wouldn't
the
proper
solution
here
be
the
same,
have
him
do
one
or
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
it
seems
sort
of
strange
to
have
a
very
special
rule
with
lesser
included
offenses
in
the
federal
court
that's
different
from
what's
applied
all
over
the
country
in
state
courts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
wouldn't
you
agree
that
congress
could
pyramid
sentences
with
lesser
included
and
greater
offenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
so
why
isn't
this
a
para...
why...
i
don't
understand
why
this
is
not
a
parad...
whatever
the
word
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
case
of...
a
conspiracy
is
always
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
cce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
is
that
any
different
from
any
normal
lesser
included
offense
situation
in
which
the
government
gets
the
verdict
on
the
greater
offense
and
the
defendant
appeals
and
has
it
set
aside?
he
walks
on
the
entire
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that's
the
general
rule,
why
wouldn't
that
rule
apply
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
enter
judgment
on
the
greater
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
back
up
just
a
second.
is
it
correct
that
it's
common
ground
here
that
the
conspiracy
offense
is
a
lesser
included
offense
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
that
were
true,
then
why
wouldn't...
shouldn't
this
be
treated
just
like
any
other
lesser
included
offense
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
maybe
it
would
simplify
things
to
do
it
that
way.
that's
the
question
i'm
asking.
i
realize
there's
been
a
lot
of
confusion--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
these
two
statutes--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
we
made
it
clear
that
one
is
a
lesser
included
of
the
other,
wouldn't
that
solve
everything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
be
wrong
with
it?
just
put
it
in
harmony
with
all
our
other
lesser
included
offense
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
reason
it
hasn't
been
done
here
is,
there's
been
a
debate
of
very
realistic
arguments
on
both
sides
as
to
whether
these
are,
in
fact,
entirely
separate
offenses,
what
did
congress
intend,
that
if
we
assume
what
everybody's
been
assuming
in
the
argument
up
to
now,
that
you
lose
on
that
issue,
then
wouldn't
it
make
sense
to
just
put
it
in
the
same
pattern?
of
course,
i
understand
you
don't
want
to
concede
that,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
because
that's
just
like
a
murder
is
more
serious
than
an
assault,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
first
up
to
us
to
decide
what
congress'
intent
was,
and
if
we
agree
with
you,
why,
then
they're
totally
separate,
but
if
we
disagree
with
you,
then
why
does
it
make
any
difference
that
they're
in
separate
statutes
rather
than
in
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
if
we
agree
with
you
that
congress
intended
two
separate
proceedings
entirely,
then
you
win,
period.
but
if
we
disagree,
and
think
that
they
did
intend
one
to
be
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
other,
even
though
they're
in
separate
provisions
of
the
code,
then
why
shouldn't
they
be
treated
just
like
a
normal
lesser
included
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
that
case
that
you
give,
you
wouldn't
have
a
conspiracy
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
i
mean,
you
can
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--every
assault
isn't
a
lesser
included
offense
of
every
murder.
it
depends
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
conspiracy
is
an
element
of
the
cce,
then
it's
always
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
example
doesn't
disagree
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
deal
with
cases
in
which...
the
only
cases
we're
concerned
with
are
those
in
which
the
government
has
made
both
a
conspiracy
charge
and
a
cce
charge,
so
it
doesn't
help
the
analysis
to
hypothesize
cce
cases
that
don't
involve
conspiracy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
you're
basically
making
the
argument
that
justice
white
accepted
in
jeffers
now,
and
eight
members
of
the
court
made
the
assumption
to
the
contrary.
they
didn't
rule
it,
but
if
we
took
the
suggestion
justice
breyer
made,
we'd
really
have
the
precedent
of
the
assumption
made
by
eight
members
of
the
court
in
jeffers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
justice
white
was
right,
his
is
a
much
simply
disposition
of
the
case
than
the
rather
convoluted
position
of
the
majority.
