mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
a
consequence
of
petitioner's
position
that
a
defendant
who
is
validly
found
guilty
by
a
jury
of
two
very
serious
federal
offenses,
drug
conspiracy
and
cce,
should
have
the
opportunity,
under
some
circumstances,
to
gain
a
windfall.
if
he's
able
to
have
the
cce
conviction...
since
the
district
court
under
petitioner's
position
may
only
enter
judgment
on
the
cce
offense,
if,
on
appeal,
he's
able
to
have
that
conviction
overturned,
the
defendant
will
obtain
the
possibility
of
going
free
notwithstanding
that
he's
committed
the
drug
conspiracy
offense,
that
he's
been
validly
charged
of
that
offense
before
a
jury--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
well,
actually,
i
guess
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
first,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
ordinary
case.
in
the
ordinary
case
of
a
simple
or
greater
and
lesser
included
offense,
where
they're
defined
in
a
single
statutory
section
and
there
are
increasing
aggravating
factors
of
the
same
series
of
offenses,
in
that
situation,
the
normal
practice
is,
you
can...
if
the
greater
offense
is
overturned,
the
court
can
enter
a
judgment
on
the
lesser
offense,
assuming...
the
court
can
enter
judgment
on
the
lesser
offense,
assuming
the
reason
for
overturning
the
greater
doesn't
cast
any
doubt
on
the
jury's
finding
that
the
defendant
committed
all
of
the
elements
of
the
lesser.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
one...
there's
the
case
we
actually
cited
in
our
brief,
the
case
from
this
court
that,
it's
a
little
bit
obscure,
but
actually
it's
normally
cited
for
that
proposition.
it's
tinder
v.
united
states.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
actually,
a
commonly
cited
case
from
the
d.c.
circuit
that
lays
that
out
is
allison
v.
united
states
at
409
f.
2d
445.
there's
a
recent
second
circuit
case,
u.s.
v.
buossono
at
926
f.
2d
230,
and
there
are
some
others.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
in--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
that
ordinarily
is
what
happened
when...
is
what
the
normal
federal
practice
is
where,
as
i
said
where
separate
offenses
are
defined
in
distinct
sections
of
a
single
statute
with
aggravating
factors.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
we're
willing
to
assume
that
for
purposes
of
this
case.
if
it
were
necessary--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--for
the
court's
decisions,
we
don't
agree
with
that
proposition.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
it's
not
the
way
it's
ordinarily
done
when
the
statutes...
where
statutes
have
as
complex
a
relationship
as
the
two
statutes--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
basic--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
that...
it
would
be
one
way
of
addressing
the
problem,
i'd
agree
with
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
basis
of
the
normal
way
of
treating
things,
as
you
mentioned,
is
that
it's
assumed
that
when
congress
puts
aggravating
factors
of
a
given
offense
in
this
particular
statute,
that
congress
only
wants
one
conviction,
and
in
fact
the
way
it's
normally
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
jury's
told
to
first
consider
the
greater,
and
then
only
if
it
finds
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
that
should
it
go
down
and
consider
each
of
the
others,
and
that,
due
to
long
practice,
and
the
way
things
have
been
done,
it's
assumed
that
when
congress
defines--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
mean,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
that
the
question
is
what
congress
intended,
and
where
congress
defined
statutes
in
two
distinct
sections
of
statutes,
and
moreover,
where
it
takes
an
offense
like
cce,
which
is
really
dramatically
different
from
an
underlying
conspiracy,
which
involves
the
defendant
obtaining
substantial
income,
acting
in
concert
with
five
or
more
people,
and
committing
a
series
of
violations,
when
it
takes
that
kind
of
statute--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
true,
and
congress
could...
could,
if
congress'
intent
were
not
to...
were
to
treat
murder
and
assault
the
same
way,
then
that
would
be
a
reasonable
way--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if
it
were...
if
they
were
treated
like
normal
lesser
included
offenses,
and
if
it
were
made
clear
that
the
procedure
whereby
you...
if
the
greater
one
were
reversed
that
the
court
could
just
enter
judgment
on
the
lesser
one,
so
long
as
the
reason
for
the
reversal
didn't
cast
any
doubt
on
the
jury's
finding
of
guilty
of
the
lesser
one,
i
mean,
that
would--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
ball
court
had
two
holdings,
both
of
which
we
agree
with.
the
first
holding
was
that
the
entry
of
a
conviction
and
the
entry
of
a
concurrent
sentence
does
in
itself
constitute
some
modicum
of
punishment,
albeit
perhaps
not
as
much
punishment
as
a
longer
prison
term,
or
a
substantially
larger
fine,
but
some
modicum
of
punishment.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
i...
maybe...
your
honor,
maybe
you're
referring
to
the
jeffers
case.
ball
did
not
deal...
i
was
going
to
get...
the
other
holding
in
ball
was
that
the
two
offenses
at
issue
there,
receipt
of
a
firearm
by
a
felon
and
possession--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--of
a
firearm
by
a
felon--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--were
essentially
to
be
treated
as
directed
at
a
single
evil
and
as
the
same
offense,
and
again,
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
jeffers
was
the
previous
case
that
involved--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--cce
and
conspiracy.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
plurality
in
that
case
stated
that
congress
didn't
intend
a
greater
prison
term
to
be
imposed
or
a
greater
fine.
they
didn't
intend
that
kind
of
pyramiding
of
punishments,
or
consecutive
punishments
to
be
imposed
on
the
defendant.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
but
they
still
went
on,
and
we're
basic...
we
are
submitting
this
case
to
the
court,
and
willing
to
accept
the
same
assumption
that
the
court
adopted
in
jeffers,
and
that
is,
we
can
assume
they
are
a
greater
and
lesser
included
offense,
but
there
still
remains
the
question
of
what
congress
intended.
jeffers
stands
for
the
proposition...
at
least,
the
plurality
opinion
in
jeffers...
that
congress
intended
not
to
impose
a
greater
prison
term
or
a
more
substantial
fine,
but
jeffers
didn't
address
the
question
of
whether
this
modicum
of
additional
punishment
that's
caused
merely
by
the
entry
of
a
judgment
and
a
concurrent
sentence,
whether
that
was
something
that
congress
would
have
imposed.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
court
could
decide
that
in
this
case.
it
would
be
our
submission
that
it's
not
a
lesser
included
offense
because
the
cce
offense
doesn't
require...
although
it
may
be
satisfied
by
proof
of
a
classic
conspiracy,
the
in
concert
with
element
doesn't
require
proof
of
a
conspiracy.
it
only
requires
that
the
defendant
act
together
with
a
number
of
other
people
to
organize
an
enterprise,
but
it
doesn't
require
that
the
other
people
who
are
involved
with
the
defendant
necessarily
know
the
criminal
goals,
or
the
full
criminal
goals,
of
the
enterprise.
if
a
defendant,
for
example,
organizes
a
business
to
transport
merchandise
from
some
country
where
drugs
are
prevalent
to
the
united
states,
and
does
so
in
a
fairly...
a
shady
and
unusual
way,
there
may
be
other
people
who
join
with
him
possibly
even
thinking
it's
an
innocent
enterprise,
or
possibly
not,
but
who
don't
know
that
in
every
one
of
those
shipments
is
a
large
amount
of
cocaine.
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
we
think
it's
reasonable
to
say
that
the
defendant
acted
in
concert
with
the
other
five
individuals
even
though
they
may...
they
couldn't
all
be
found
guilty
of
conspiracy.
for
that
reason...
and
this
was
an
argument
also
that
we
submitted
in
jefferson
the
court
didn't
reach.
for
that
reason,
we
don't
think
that
it's
a
classic
relationship
of
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
in
that
case--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--in
that
case,
you
wouldn't.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
and
in
that
case--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
analysis
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
you
don't
look
at
whether,
on
the
facts
of
a
particular
case,
whether
the
defendant
was
not
only
guilty
of
the
conspiracy
but
also
the
cce,
just...
what
you
look
at
is
whether
under
the
statute
it's
possible
to
be
guilty
of
the
cce
without
being
guilty
of
the
conspiracy,
and
it's
our
position,
because
of
the
example
i
just
gave,
that
that
is
possible,
that
if
the
court
had
to
reach
the
question--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
i
agree
with
you
in
the
following
sense.
i
think
what
my
example
showed
was
that
they
are,
in
fact,
distinct
offenses,
but
in
any
event,
the
question
is
what
congress
intended
for
defendants
in
the
position
of
petitioner
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
because
congress...
because
the
court
in
jeffers
held
that
in
any
event
what
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
congress'
intent
with
respect
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
actually
in
many
cases
it
is,
although
the
court
frequently,
when
it
deals
with
that
question,
looks
not
only
at
what...
at
the
relation
of
lesser...
and
greater
included
offenses,
but
also
looks
at
what...
the
direct
indications
of
what
congress,
how
congress
intended--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
the
court
specifically
said
it
i
think
two
or
three
times
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
and...
actually,
the
court
didn't
have
an
opinion
in
jeffers.
i
should
correct
myself.
there
was
only
the
plurality
opinion
that
even
proceeded
along
this
line
of
reasoning.
justice
white
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
he
said
they
were
not
greater
or
lesser
included
offenses,
and
therefore
any
kind
of
accumulation
of
punishment
would
have
been
permissible
in
his
view,
and
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
that
is
what
the
court...
i
think
that's
what
the
court
did
in
ball.
it
looked
at
those
two
particular
statutes
in
that
case
to
determine
what
congress
intended
with
respect
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think
to
be
fair,
it's
also--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
mean,
i
think
as
a
logical
matter
it's
possible
congress
could
have
had
any
kind
of
intent
with
respect
to
punishment,
because
the
constitution
doesn't
impose
limits
in
that
respect.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
notion
of
punishment
that's
involved
here
is
a
fairly
involved,
refined
notion
of
punishment.
i
mean,
merely
having
the
piece
of
paper
say
that
you
got
convicted
of
both
crimes
and
concurrent
sentences,
in
this
case
concurrent
life
sentences,
don't
really
impose
the
kind
of
disability
on
a
defendant
that
the
separate...
that
an
additional
term
of
years
in
prison,
or
an
additional
fine
would
have
imposed.
and
when
you're
working
with
such
refined
notions
of
punishment,
i
think
it's
important
to
also
try
to
figure
out
how...
whether
the
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
that
kind
of
refined
notion
of
punishment
to
get
in
the
way
of
what
is
truly
one
of
its
primary
goals,
which
is
seeing
to
it
that
a
defendant
who
is...
who
commits
and
is
convicted
of
both
section
846
conspiracy
and
a
section
848
cce,
that
that
defendant
receives
the
punishment
that
congress
intended
for
both
offenses,
regardless
of
some
fluke
of
later
judicial
procedure.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
only
case
that
i'm
aware
of
is
ball.
the
only
case
is
united
states
v.
ball.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
ball
was...
is
in
some
tension
with
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
the...
ball
had
a
fairly
unique
circumstance,
which
was,
you
had
two
statutes
of
receiving
and
possessing
a
firearm
by
a
felon.
the
court
basically
treated
them
as
if
they
were
really
two
ways
of
committing
the
same
offense.
as
the
court
said
in
its
opinion,
there's
one
evil
that
congress
was
legislating
against
there
and,
in
fact,
a
year
after
the
decision
in
ball,
congress
in
fact
took
the
two
statutes,
which
really
by
happenstance
were
just
codified
separately,
and
combined
them
into
what...
what's
now
18
u.s.c.
922(h).
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
agree,
and
again
we
don't
disagree,
or
we're
not
asking
the
court
to...
our
position
doesn't
require
disagreeing
with
that
holding.
it's
only
that
it
does
perhaps
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
recognition
that
the
kind
of
punishment
that's
imposed
merely...
especially
in
a
case
like
this
merely
by
the
entry
of
an
extra
judgment
and
a
concurrent
sentence
is
not
the
kind
of
punishment
is
not...
is
one
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
avoid
the
problem
that
was
being
addressed
during
petitioner's
argument,
which
is
the
possibility
that
defendant
is
going
to
gain
a
windfall
and
not
receive
a
prison
sentence
for
a
drug
conspiracy
that
he
committed.
i
would
also
add
that
it's
even
less
of
a
punishment
than
it
was
in
ball.
now,
at
the
time
of
ball,
there
was
parole
in
the
federal
system.
there
is
no
parole,
and
one
of
the
things
that
chief
justice
burger
referred
to
was
the
possibility
that
the
extra
conviction
could
have
an
effect
on
a
parole
decision.
well,
in
fact,
under
cce
there
never
has
been
parole,
so
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
if--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
way
tinder
has
been
read
by
the
lower
courts,
and
the
court
didn't...
this
court
did
not
discuss
this
issue
in
any
detail,
as
you
know,
but
the
way
it's
been
read
by
the
lower
courts
as
whereas
the
greater
offense
required
proof
of
over,
whatever
it
was,
over
$5,000
of
merchandise
stolen,
and
that
was
an
element
of
the
greater
offense,
there
was
a...
that
was
a
felony,
there
was
also
a
misdemeanor
offense
that
didn't
require
proof
of
that
element,
and
therefore
the
relationship
between
the
two
offenses
was
a
greater
and
lesser
included
offense.
but
if
it
were
clear
that
tinder
would
apply
in
that
situation,
the
government's
primary
interest
here
is
in
seeing
to
it
that
a
defendant
who's
convicted
of
both,
under
both
statutes
receives
the
punishment
that
congress
intended
for
both.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
but
it's...
the
disposition
of...
it's
not
just
reversed,
it's
also
the
disposition
of
the
case,
which
was
entry--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--of
judgment
on
the
misdemeanor,
but
i
agree.
nonetheless,
tinder
has
been
taken
by
the
lower
courts
to
mean
that.
i
think
the
seventh
circuit's
approach
is
the
simplest
way
of
achieving
the
result
of
making
sure
that
the
defendant
who
commits
both
offenses
receives
the
punishment
that
congress
intended
for
both.
now,
the
second
circuit's
approach
is
another
way
of
encompassing
the
same
objective,
and
although
it's...
the
seventh...
under
the
second,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
submission
that
congress
didn't
intend,
and
believes
that
congress
didn't
intend
separate
convictions
and
concurrent
sentences,
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
would
be
to
deal
with
the
case
like
the
second
circuit
does,
which
is
to
enter
one
judgment
of
conviction,
and
make
it
clear
on
the
judgment
that
a
single
conviction
is
being
entered
for
violation
of
the
two
statutes,
and
a
single
sentence
is
being
entered.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
and
the
court
stated
that
the
relationship
between
those
two
offenses
is
a
very
complex
relationship,
and
it
cannot
be
simply
analogized
to
the
greater...
that
of
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses.
near
the
end
of
its
opinion,
it
cited
the
jeffers
case
once,
but
the
point
of
that
citation
and
what
it
said
about
jeffers
was
simply,
we
are
not
dealing
today
with
an
issue
of
dealing
with
a
conspiracy
offense
based
on
the
same
agreement.
we're
dealing
with
the
relationship
between
an
individual
criminal
predicate
offense,
which
can
be
one
of
any
number
that
can
be
a
predicate
for
cce
and
the
cce
offense
itself,
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
not
only
could
defendant
be
separately
punished,
defendant
could
be
separately
prosecuted
for
those
two.
but
i
don't...
i
think
really
the
only
relevance
of
garrett
is
that
it
recognized
that
that
wasn't
the
issue
that
it
was
dealing
with
in
that...
the
court
was
dealing
with
in
that
case.
as
i
was
saying,
the
second
circuit's
approach
doesn't...
has
no
possible
consequences
that
would
enure
to
the
defendant's
detriment.
there's
only
one
conviction.
there's
only
one
sentence,
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
ball,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
a
judgment
of
conviction
that
was
entered
the
way
the
second
circuit
does.
since
that...
the
second
circuit's
approach
would
also
make
it
clear
that
the
defendant
has
to
bring
all
of
his
issues
to
the
appellate
court
in
the
very
first
appeal
of
the
conviction,
and
since--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
that
ball
was
concerned
not
just
with
the
very
abstract
question
of
counting
of
crimes,
but
the
possible
consequences
that
could
flow
to
the
defendant
from
two
convictions,
and
those
consequences
can't
flow.
in
other
words,
ball
can't
flow
from
merely
the
entry
of
a
single
conviction.
ball
didn't
hold
that
the
entry
of
two
convictions,
if
it
had
no
collateral
consequences
whatsoever,
would
still,
just
as
a
matter
of
stigma,
constitute
punishment
that
has
to
be
dealt
with.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i
guess
i
would
think
it's
stigmatically
neutral,
i
think,
and
particularly
in
the
context
of
these
statutes,
where
the
cce
offense
is
really
one
of
the
most
serious
ones
in
the
federal
criminal
law.
the
fact
that
a
defendant
was
also...
was
convicted
of
a
single
conviction,
convicted
once
of
violating
cce
and
a
drug
conspiracy
statute
i
don't
think
carries
any
additional
stigma.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's...
the
latter
is
the
ordinary
way
of
doing
it.
where
the
two--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--where
the
two
bear
the
simple--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
i
think
if
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
it
depends,
but
if
the
conviction
is
for
the
greater
offense--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
if
he's
convicted
for
a
reason
that's
unrelated
to
the
lesser
offense--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--then
you
can
just
enter
a
conviction
on
the
lesser
offense.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
in
ordinary--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
think
that
that's
correct.
i
think
under
the
tinder
case
and
at
least
the
way...
and
the
way
the
tinder
case
has
been
understood
by
the
lower
courts,
the
court
can
simply
go
back
and
enter
judgment,
and
in
fact
should
just
enter
judgment
on
the
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
jury
has
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
all
of
the
elements--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
government's...
i
would
say
our
primary
interest
in
this
case
is
making
sure
that
whatever
mechanism
is
involved,
the
defendant,
who
has
committed
both
the
846
and
848
offenses--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--gets...
and
can't,
through
some
fluke
on
collateral
attack
or
appeal,
by
getting
one
of
those
overturned,
for
a
reason
unrelated
to
the
other,
doesn't
therefore
end
up
scott-free.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
the
normal...
the
normal
course,
in
the
normal
course
or
a
statute
that
defines
greater
and
lesser
degrees
of
a
single
offense,
committing
an
offense
and
then
committing
the
same
offense
with
a
gun,
or
something
like
that,
i
think
that
that's
the
way
congress
intended
things
to
work.
i
do
think
that
where
congress
defined
the
statutes
entirely
independently
and
included--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think,
actually,
yes.
yes,
in
the
sense
that
if
it
were
clear
that
that
was
a
procedure
that
would
work
in
these
kinds
of
cases--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would
protect
the
interest
that
the
government
is
seeking
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
we
do...
well...
we
do
disagree
that
it
is
a
lesser
included--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if
it's
clear
that
that
procedure
would
work,
at
least
in
terms
of
our...
again,
i
don't
think
this
is
what
congress
intended
here,
but
in
terms
of
our
interest--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--so
long
as
it
was
clear,
again,
that
the
defendant
who
somehow
managed
to
get
the
cce
conviction
overturned
on
direct
or
on
collateral
attack,
the
judgment
could
still
be
entered
on
the
lesser...
on
the
conspiracy
offense.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
so...
and
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
that
is
our
primary
interest.
as
long
as
that
was
clear,
then
that
would
be...
that
would
accommodate
that
interest.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
for
the
reasons
i
said
before,
i
really
do
want
to
add
that
we
don't
view
them
as
greater
or
lesser
included
offenses,
and
in
our
view--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
you...
i
think
actually
you'd
have
four...
there
were
four
members
of
the
court
who
i
think
accepted
the
assumption.
it
didn't
make
merely
the
assumption,
but
would
have
held
that.
there
were
another
four
members
who
did
assume
it,
but
i
don't
think
that
you
can
take
much
weight
from
the
fact
that
four
members
of
the
court
were
willing
to
assume
that,
since
they
found
it
didn't
make
any
difference
for
that
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
that
the
four...
the
plurality
of
the
court
in
that
case
was...
it's
true
they
didn't
accept
justice
white's
view.
they
also
didn't
accept
the
view
of
the
concurring
opinion,
either.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
think
it
was
because
the
court
believed
it
was...
because
the
plurality
believed
it
was
a
difficult
question
that
it
did
assume
it,
and
it
found
that
in
that
case
it
could
resolve
the
question
simply
by
referring
to
congressional--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
again,
i
do...
it
has
been
taken
to
be...
and
i've
been
cautious
in
how
i
word
this
throughout.
that's
been
taken
to
be
the
holding
of
tinder,
and
i
don't
really
think
that
tinder
can
be
read
to
mean
anything
else.
it
is
the
general
practice
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
can't
say
that
it's
totally
secure--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
really
more
than
that.
it's
that
the
defendant...
the
jury
necessarily
found
that
the
defendant
committed
all
of
the
elements
of
that
offense,
and
then
what
the
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals
is,
some
element
that
doesn't
have
to
do
with
that
offense,
so
in
a
very
real
sense,
the
jury
has
convicted
him
of
a
crime
and
the
jury
has
found
him
guilty
of
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
and
i
think
the
proposition
is
that
having
done
that,
there's
no
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals...
generally
what's
done
is
in
orders,
it
remands
in
orders
to
the
district
court
to
enter
judgment
on
the
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
guess
this
court
has
never
gone
so
far
as
to
hold
that
that
level
of
effect
really
constitutes
a
punishment
that
in
any
real
sense
should
determine
to
guide
the
analysis
or
in
particular
should
stand
in
the
way
of
reaching
what
i
think
is
a
logical
seventh
circuit--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--result
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
said--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
but
they
only...
but
ball
said
that
only
after
going...
it
said
there
is
some
modicum
of
additional
punishment
that
attaches
to...
that
attaches
to
a
conviction
in
the
circumstance
where
both...
there
was
both
adverse...
the
possibility
of
adverse
collateral
effects
and
this
kind
of
stigmatic
injury,
but
ball...
but
then
ball
said
that
in
this
case
we're
only
holding
that
the
conviction
has
to
be
reversed,
and
we're
only
holding
that
the...
and
the
sentence
can't
be
entered
because
of
the
particular
relationship
between
the
two
statutes
here.
it
requires
that
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--thank
you.
