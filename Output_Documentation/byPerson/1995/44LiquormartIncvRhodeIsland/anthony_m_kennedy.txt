suppose
that
students
in
rhode
island
over
18,
or
over
21,
had
a
computer
internet
and
one
student
was
very
interested
in
advising
all
of
the
people
that
would
plug
into
the
internet
what
the
prices
were
in
various
liquor
stores
for,
say,
beer
and
wine,
could
the
state
prohibit
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
addressing
the
first
amendment
concerns,
are
there
first
amendment
problems
with
the
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
suppose
that
there
were
some
sort
of
a
charge
to
access
this
particular
information.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
were
testimony...
and
there
isn't.
this
is
wholly
hypothetical,
but
suppose
the
availability
of
the
internet
type
of...
or
computer
information
type
of
publication
was
widely
available
and
widely
used,
would
that
change
the
calculus
here,
so
far
as
judging
the
constitutionality
of
banning
it
in
newspapers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
a
newspaper
just
on
its
own
print
all
this
information,
just
as
advice
to
the
consumer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there
were
widespread
exchange
of
price
information
in
some
of
the
media
that
i
propose,
and
some
of
the
methods
that
i
propose,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
state's
interest
would
be
the
same.
i
mean,
this
undercuts
your
interest.
you
don't
want
people
to
know
about
price
changes
because
that
might
increase
consumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
liquor
salesman
says,
please
tell
your
neighbor
about
our
low
prices.
could
the
state
prohibit
him
from
doing
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
constitutionally
could
the
state
prohibit
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
bullets
and
firearms?
could
the
state
impose
price
advertizing
restrictions
on
those?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
part
of
the
history
in
the
liquor
case
is
that
the
mom
and
pop
stores
want
this
legislation
every
badly.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
part
of
your
brief
you
say
that
price
advertizing
is
the
least
informative
speech
concerning
a
product.
if
i
were
writing
the
opinion
for
the
court
sustaining
your
position,
i
think
that
would
be
a
most
unconvincing
beginning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
curious
to
know
where
you
got
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
were
not
talking
about
price
information
on
a
scale
of
priorities
of
interest
of
the
consumers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
were
not
trying
to
convey
the
fact
that
price
is
not
of
vital
interest
to
consumers
of
most
products.
