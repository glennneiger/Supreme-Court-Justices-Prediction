mr.
evan
t.
lawson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
price
advertizing
has
always
been
at
the
heart
of
the
commercial
speech
doctrine.
indeed,
it
was
the
court's
concern
for
the
free
flow
of
price
information
that
prompted
the
court
about
20
years
ago
to
overturn
the
concept
that
commercial
speech
had
no
first
amendment
protection
and
to
accord
particularly
price
advertizing
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
since
that
time,
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court
has
developed,
and
the
central
hudson
test
has
become
established
and
refined.
application
of
the
central
hudson
test
to
this
case
would
yield
the
result
that
rhode
island's
ban
on
truthful
price
advertizing
should
be
found
unconstitutional.
ordinarily,
the
central
hudson
test
seems
to
be
discussed
in
a
sequential
fashion,
but
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
last
part
of
the
central
hudson
test,
because
i
think
that
it
is
under
that
part
that
the
defect
of
this
ban
is
the
most
clearly
apparent.
the
last
part
of
the
central
hudson
test
requires
that
the
state's
restriction
on
speech
be
no
more
expansive
than
is
necessary.
as
this
court
has
posited
it,
that
means
that
the
restriction
not
burden
speech
any
more
than
is
necessary.
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
clear
on
the
record
both
from
the
testimony
of
the
state's
own
expert,
and
from
the
obvious
facts
of
the
case
that
are
not
disputed,
that
rhode
island
could
accomplish
the
purpose
that
it
says
it
wants
to
accomplish,
that
is,
keeping
an
artificial
price
floor
for
alcoholic
beverages
simply
by
setting
tax
rates
or
by
setting
minimum
consumer
prices.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i'm
not
arguing
for
a
least
restrictive
means
test.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that,
where
the
state
has
a
choice
between
regulating
speech
and
not
regulating
speech
at
all,
that
it
has
an
obvious
alternative
that
doesn't
burden
speech.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don't
think
it
is
because
i
think
the
least
restrictive
means
approach
would
deal
with
an
array
of
choices
of
various
degrees
of
regulation
of
speech.
the
precedent
that
i
would
cite
for
this
is
the
recent
coors
decision.
in
the
recent
coors
decision,
you
will
recall,
the
government
was
concerned
with
preventing
strength
wars
and
this
court--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that
is
correct.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
state's
power
to
control
alcoholic
beverages
sales
is
not
dependent
upon
the
twenty
first
amendment,
but
is
inherent
in
their
police
power--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes,
it--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--yes,
it
does,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you,
and
what
i've
argued,
is
that
the
twenty
first
amendment
does
not
in
any
way
cut
back
on
the
force
of
the
first
amendment
as
it
is
applied
to
the
states.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
quite
frankly,
i
can't
explain
it
because
the
court
did
not
issue
an
opinion,
and
the
court
has
said
in
other--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--that's
correct,
but
the
court
has
said
on
other
occasions
that
a
summary
dismissal
of
this
sort
does
not
imply
even
agreement
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
is
below.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that
is
true.
now,
i
can
distinguish
i
think
rather
easily
the
queensgate
facts
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
for
example,
in
the
queensgate
situation,
there
was
no
blanket
ban
on
price
advertizing.
there
was
a
ban
on
advertizing
a
price
advantage.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
state
could,
in
fact,
have
a
higher
level
of
justification.
i'm
not
arguing
that
that
would
be
proper,
but
i
think
it
clearly
distinguishes
that
from
a
total
blackout
of
price
information,
which
is
what's
present
in
this
case.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don't
think
that
posadas
is
quite
that
strong
an
authority.
i
think
that
what
posadas
says,
as
i
read
it,
it
suggests
that
if
the
state
wants
to
stifle
demand
for
a
product,
at
least
under
the
circumstances
of
posadas
it
could
do
so
by
stifling
advertizing.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
as
i
read
the
court's
jurisprudence
with
the
question
put
in
that
fashion,
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
because
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
states
may
not
ban
truthful,
nonmisleading
advertizing.
they
may,
however,
restrict
it
if
they
do
so
in
accordance
with
the
central
hudson
test,
so
if
you
put
the
question
in
terms
of
a
general
ban,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
no.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes,
and
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
states
must
always
act
in
accordance
with
the
constitution.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
the
way
it
squares
with
posadas
is
that,
first
of
all,
in
posadas
the
court
was
not
confronted
with
a
total
ban
on
advertizing.
it
was
confronted
with
a
partial
restriction
on
certain
types
of
advertizing,
so
that
in
terms
of
a
precedential
effect,
it
seems
to
me
you
cannot
simply
take
the
posadas
result
and
graft
it
onto
this
case.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that's
right.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
agree
with
you,
and
i
think
that's
why--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--posadas
is
distinguished
only
in
that
each
case
must
apply
the
central
hudson
test
to
the
facts
that
are
before
it.
the
court
applied
the
central
hudson
test
in
posadas
and
found
the
particular
ban
in
posadas
to
be
justified.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don't
think
that
it
is.
i
think
it's
very
distinguishable
from
that
because
of
what
the
state
has
asserted
as--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--its
interest.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that
seems
clear.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that
seems
clear,
too.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that's
probably
true
as
well.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think...
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
could
or
it
couldn't.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think...
no,
i
think
the
state
has
a
great
deal
of
power
to
ban
many
things,
and
that's
why
i
think
that
the
logic
of
saying,
simply
because
you
may
have
the
power
to
ban
something,
that
you
then
have
the
power
to
ban
speech
about
something
that
you're
not
banning,
is
quite
a
different
proposition.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
think
at
some
point
you
get
to
a--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--you
get
to
a
point
of
irrationality.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
would
be...
i'd
be
hard--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
state...
i
think
that
before
you
get
to
the
kinds
of
questions
of
whether
the
state
could
ban
toothpaste,
you
have
to
get
through
practical
political
considerations.
i
think
that
there
are
certain
things
that
the
state
can't--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--i
think
that--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--i
don't
think
in
rhode
island
you
would
want
to
run
on
the
raising
the
price
of
alcoholic
beverages
ticket,
either.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that's
exactly
my...
yes.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that's
right.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
think--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--well,
i
think
that
the
court
has
certainly
suggested
in
the
coors
case
that
when
analyzing
bans
on
commercial
speech,
it
is
not
appropriate
to
recognize
some
hierarchy
of
products
some
of
which
are
entitled
to
more
protection
than
others.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it
doesn't
control
in
the
sense
that...
it
controls
in
the
sense
that
you
apply
the
central
hudson
test
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
it
doesn't
control
in
the
sense
that
the
application
of
the
central
hudson
test
to
this
case
yields
a
contrary
result
than
it
would
yield,
or
than
it
yielded
in
posadas.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--i
think
that
under
the
central
hudson
test,
the
state
would
have
to
show
that--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--well,
if--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--if
the
state
were
able
to
show
that
in
fact--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--i
think
the
law
is
that
under
the
central
hudson
test,
they
have
not
satisfied
the
central
hudson
test.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no,
i'm
saying
that
the
state--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--well,
if
there
were
hearings
that
bore
out
those
facts--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--and
if
there
were
proof
that
was
satisfactory
that
the
state's
hypothesis
were,
in
fact,
correct--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--well,
i
think--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--i
think--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--that
is
what
i
said,
but
the
proposition
added
a
new...
the
hypothetical
added
a
new
factor,
which
was
that
the
state
didn't
want
to
keep
the
prices
high,
they
just
wanted
to
deter
price
advertizing
because
they
thought
that
the
presence
of
price
advertizing
itself
was
a
stimulant.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think
that
i
do
and
i
also,
in
reviewing
the
cases
that
deal
with
this
type
of
issue,
note
that
very
often
these
cases
simply
turn
upon
logical
discourses.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
think
that
going
into
the
hypothetical,
and
recognizing
that
it's
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
the
question
then
would
turn
upon
how
much
the
state
has
to
show.
this
court
has
never
made
explicit
how
much
the
state
has
to
show
as
a
factual
matter.
that's
why--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--i...
that
is
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes,
it
is,
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
despite
the
characterization
of
the
first
circuit
that
the
evidence
went
both
ways,
when
you
really
look
at
it,
the
evidence
only
went
one
way.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
the
trial
court
evaluated
the
evidence
and
found
as
a
fact
that
there
was
no
material--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--well,
i
think
that
the
first
circuit
ordinarily
would
only
be
able
to
reverse
a
finding
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
think
that
first
of
all
there
may
be...
if
the
state...
if
the
state
stated
a
logical
proposition,
and
that
was
unopposed,
perhaps
that
would
be
a
different
case,
but
in
this
case
there
was
evidence,
and
the
state's
own
expert
i
think
agreed
that
simply
changing
the
price
of
liquor
does
not
necessarily
affect
consumption.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
the
problem
with
the
state's
position
on
the
search
time
argument,
which
is
the
generic
problem
with
the
state's
position,
is
that
in
order
for
its
theory
to
work,
there
has
to
be
enough
of
a
shift
in
prices
that
there
will
actually
be
an
effect
on
consumption.
this
is
what
the
state's
expert
talked
about
as
the
optimum
price,
and
the
state's
expert
conceded
that
1)
he
didn't
know
what
the
optimum
price
would
be,
and
he
essentially
conceded
that
he
had
no
way
of
knowing,
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
rhode
island,
with
its
price
ban
in
effect
for
almost
40
years,
was
in
the
top
third
in
consumption,
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
state's
theory
worked.
and
the
three
studies
that
were
introduced,
including
the
ornstein
and
hanssens
study
that
the
state
relied
on,
indicated
that
the
price
advertizing
ban
had
no
effect
on
consumption
in
what
are
called
licensed
states,
that
is,
states
that
use
the
free
enterprise
system.
therefore,
there
simply
is
a
failure
of
proof
of
the
connection
between
an
effect
on
price
and
an
adequate
effect
on
price.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
don't
think...
let
me
illustrate
the
common
sense
approach
in
this
fashion.
hypothetically,
let's
assume
that
i
drink
one
glass
of
wine
a
week.
if
wine
suddenly
became
twice
as
expensive,
i'm
not
going
to
pass
up
on
my
one
glass
of
wine
a
week.
the
state's
swing
in
prices
is
much
less
dramatic
than
that.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don't
think
that's...
i
don't
think
that
that's
really
accurate.
i
think
that--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--well--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--if
that
hypothesis
were
correct,
which
seems
to
make
common
sense,
it
would
show
up
in
some
data,
and
it
doesn't.
we
have
a
dramatic
situation,
the
michigan
situation,
where
you
had
a
price
advertizing
ban
in
effect,
you
had
it
lifted
for
16
months,
and
you
had
it
put
back
into
effect,
it
was
studied,
and
there
was
found
to
be
no
difference.
now,
if
the
theory
is
correct
that
people
will
suddenly
buy
more
because
the
price
advertizing--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--well,
i--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--i
think
the
happy
hour
situation
is
different.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
the
happy--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--the
happy
hour
situation
is
different,
and
i
think
you
also
have
to
remember
that
what
the
state
has
said
it's
directing
its
regulation
at
is
not
volume
of
sales,
it's
directing
its
regulation
at
temperance,
which
seems
to
mean
abuse
of
consumption,
although
the
state
has
shifted
its
ground
a
little
bit.
there's
no
indication
that
abuse
of
consumption
is
affected
by
the
kind
of
price
fix
that
the
state
is
trying
to
put
into
effect.
and
once
again,
getting
back
to
part
4,
it
can
accomplish
that
objective
without
burdening
speech
at
all,
and
i--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--well,
i--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--i
have
in
mind--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--no.
i
have
in
mind
the
bose
case,
which
would
indicate
that
the
court
does
have
an
independent
role
at
least
when
the
lower
court's
decision
runs
contrary
to
protecting--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--freedom
of
speech.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
speech,
particularly.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it's
the
first
amendment--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--yes.
the
first
amendment--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--not
that
i'm
aware
of.
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don't
know...
one
of
the
things
that's
interested
me
about
reviewing
the
commercial
speech
cases
is
how
rarely
they
seem
to
actually
be
tried
with
evidence.
mostly
they
seem
to
be...
they
seem
to
play
out
in
some
theoretical
realm,
and
in
the
circumstances
where
there
is
evidence,
by
and
large
the
court
seems
to
be
upholding
the
side
that
has
the
weight
of
the
evidence...
for
example,
in
the
florida
bar
case.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no,
it's
not.
i
would
like
to
reserve
2
minutes.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
will
waive
the
rebuttal.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
the
state
voluntarily
stepped
in
in
place
of
its
administrator.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think
that
the
eleventh
amendment
would
not
be
a
problem
where
the
state
voluntarily--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--sort
of
between
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
the
case
reaching
the
first
circuit.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think
it
was
originally
taken
in
the
name
of
the
liquor
control
administrator,
but
my
memory
of
this
is
somewhat
dim,
but
what
happened
is,
i
believe--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--no,
i
definitely
didn't
bring
them
in.
they
came
in
and
the
state
in
fact...
what
happened
was,
i
think
the
question
of
the
state
coming
in
came
about
at
the
same
time
that
a
stay
was
being
sought
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
pending
appeal.
