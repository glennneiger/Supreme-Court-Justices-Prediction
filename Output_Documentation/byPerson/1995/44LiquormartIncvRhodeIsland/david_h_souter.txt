justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
specials
and
all
these
different--
--mr.
lawson,
can't
you
concede--
--what's
the
answer?
in
justice
breyer's
example,
can't
you
concede
that
the
state
might
very
well,
under
those
circumstances,
prevail
without
conceding
that
the
state
prevails
in
this
case,
because
you've
got
at
least
one
added
overlay,
it
seems
to
me,
in
this
case,
and
that
is
you've
got
a
lot
of...
or,
you've
got
some
empirical
studies
done
by
parties
who
are
not
interested
in
this
litigation
which
tend
to
show
that
what
is,
in
fact,
i
think
intuitively,
a
very
common
sense
view...
i
mean,
judge
aldrich
was
depending
on
that
view
to
a
degree
in
the
court
of
appeals...
doesn't
in
fact
seem
to
be
borne
out.
so
don't
you
have
a
different
case
from
the
one
that
rests
upon
the
intuitive
good
sense
and
intuitive
good
sense
alone?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
answer
is
ultimately
going
to
have
to
take
into
account
the
evidence
on
that
point,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
just
a
quick
point.
apropos
of
evaluating
what
indications
there
are
in
the
record,
evaluating
the
evidence,
do
you
concede
that
this
court
has
no
independent
role
in
doing
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
seemed
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--by
your
silence
a
little
while
ago.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
protecting
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
speech.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
first
amendment--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
do
you
get
over
the
requirement
which
i
thought
was
expressed
in
rubin
and
coors
and
in
fact
the
indication
has
got
to
be
that
the
state's
interest
is...
i
think
the
word
was
materially
advanced?
it
seems
to
me
that
that,
if
that
means
anything
it
requires
something
more
than
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
state's
belief
that
it
would
be
advanced.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we're
not
talking,
i
think,
about
quantity
of
evidence.
we're
just
talking
about
the
quality
of
evidence,
and
the
evidence
has
got
to
indicate,
rubin
says,
that
there
is
a
material
advancement
of
the
state's
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
do
you
get
around
that,
and
i
guess
more
specifically,
how
is
that
indicated
on
this
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
by
the
way,
do
we
make
that
determination,
that
in
fact
the
advancement,
if
it
is
advancement,
is
to
a
material
and
substantial
degree?
is
that
a
judgment
for
this
court
to
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
but
we're
dealing
with
a
first
amendment
issue.
do
you
think
we
have
an
independent
evidentiary
weighing
function
because
there
is
a
first
amendment
speech
issue
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--could
i
just
call
you
back,
though,
to
my
last
question?
in
making
that
determination,
does
this
court
have
an
independent
function
in
weighing
the
evidence
because
there
is
a
first
amendment
issue
involved?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
we
have
said
in
noncommercial
speech
cases
that
in
fact
the
court,
and
any
court
dealing
with
a
first
amendment
speech
issue,
has
an
obligation
to
evaluate
the
evidence
independently.
now,
do
we
have
that
obligation
here?
that's
something
quite
different
from
saying
there
is
a
sufficient
basis
in
the
evidence
from
which
a
lower
court
could
have
concluded
whatever
it
concluded.
it's
an
independent
role
in
evidentiary
evaluation.
do
we
have
that
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is
your
answer
that
we
do
have
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
hasn't
this
court
got
to
have
the
reasonable
belief,
if
we
are
going
to...
or
be
justified
in
having
the
reasonable
belief,
if
we
are
going
to
engage
in
that
independent
evidentiary
evaluation?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
now,
why
should
we
have
that
reasonable
belief?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
happened
to
the
vigor
of
the
twenty
first
amendment?
a
moment
ago
you
were
saying
it
was
pretty
good
against
the
first
amendment,
but
suddenly
it's
weakened.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
i
thought...
it
was
the
constitutional
problems
that
you
alluded
to
that
i
was
alluding
to.
if
the
twenty
first
amendment
is
good
against
speech,
why
isn't
it
good
against
these
constitutional
problems?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
have
constitutional
problems
in
setting
a
liquor
price
when
you've
got
the
twenty
first
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
the
artificial
inducement
was
in
the
price,
in
the
capacity
to
advertize
low
prices,
not
the
capacity
to
advertize
as
such.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
showing
that
the
state
can
perfectly
well
ban
all
advertizing
of
liquor.
you'd
take
it
all
the
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
so,
if
we
accept
the
uniqueness
argument...
and
i
think
you
can
make
a
very
good
uniqueness
argument
here.
gambling
is
in
a
different
category
because
the
states
are
going
on
a
binge
of
supporting
gambling,
they're
running
it.
red
meat
does
not
seem
to
have
found
very
much
disfavor,
and
so
on
and
so
on.
i
think
you've
got
a
good
argument
for
uniqueness.
if
we
buy
the
uniqueness
argument,
are
we
in
effect
saying
that
posadas
was
incorrectly
decided,
so
that
we
would
have
to
overrule...
in
effect
we
would
be
implicitly
overruling
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
take
that
as
your
argument
here
because
rhode
island
could,
in
fact,
preclude
the
importation
and
sale
of
any
liquor
whatsoever,
it
therefore
can
regulate
its
advertizing?
i
mean,
if
the
posadas
argument
is
good,
why
isn't
it
good
for
you?
