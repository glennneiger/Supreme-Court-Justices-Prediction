wasn't
that
a
federal
regulation
we
dealt
with--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
coors?
and
here
we're
dealing
with
a
state
regulation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
presumably
the
states
have
a
little
more
leeway
because
of
the
twenty
first
amendment
in
the
area
of
control
of
alcoholic
beverages
sales.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
surely
the
twenty
first
amendment
extends
some
power
to
the
states
that
they
wouldn't
otherwise
have
in
this
area--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--barriers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
explain
this
court's,
action
in
queensgate
investment
company
in
1982,
where
the
court
dismissed
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question
a
case
where
a
state
regulation
of
price
advertizing
of
liquor
was
upheld?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
least
it
said
there
wasn't
a
substantial
federal
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
posadas
is
some
authority
for
saying
that
the
state
could
ban
any
advertizing
at
all
of
alcoholic
beverages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
rhode
island
could
ban
all
advertizing
of
alcoholic
beverages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
constitutional
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
the
state
could
not
set
some
kind
of
minimum
prices
for
alcohol?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
doesn't
that
just
give
states
more
power
within
the
interstate
commerce
clause
area?
has
this
court
ever
said
that
the
twenty
first
amendment
gives
the
states
more
power
to
interfere
with
the
first
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
said
we
weave
the
twenty
first
amendment
in
and
out
of
some
first
amendment
analysis.
i
think
that
would
be
a
disaster.
can
you
win
your
case
if
the
twenty
first
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
say
today
is
the
state's
ultimate
interest
here,
to
reduce
consumption
of
alcohol?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it
likely
that
a
legislature,
that
the
rhode
island
legislature
would
enact
direct
price
control
or
raise
taxes
to
do
that,
or
does
it
have
to
depend
on
this
very
indirect
way
of
achieving
that
goal?
