justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
this
case,
counsel,
more
like
gambling
ads
than
it
is
like
the
price
of
drugs
approved
by
the
fda?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
we
could--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
state,
as
you
said,
could
ban
any
sale
of
liquor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
could
ban
gambling
in
its
borders.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
couldn't
ban
fda
approved
drugs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
couldn't
ban
professional
services.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
may
i
take
us
away
from
toothpaste
and
back
to
gambling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
i
just
look
at
this
court's
precedent
and
i
say,
well,
there's
virginia
board
and
that
concern,
advertizing
the
price
of
drugs,
and
then
there's
the
restriction
on
advertizing
to
locals
gambling
casinos,
so
it
seems
to
me
liquor
is
closer
to
gambling
casinos
than
it
is
to
drugs,
so
why
doesn't
posadas
control?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lawson,
why
are
you
going
away
from
your
first
point,
which
was,
if
they
want
to
keep
the
price
high,
there
are
ways
that
they
can
keep
the
price
high
that
don't
involve
speech?
that's...
the
state
said
something
else
besides
keeping
the
price
high.
they
say,
we
can
deter
liquor
sales
1)
by
having
a
high
price,
also
making
it
harder
to
find
what
you
want.
you
can't
just
run
in
and
say,
give
me
the
special
that
you
advertized
in
the
paper,
the
search
time,
and
there
i
don't
see
your
nonspeech
alternative
working.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lawson,
why
isn't
it
just
common
sense
that
if
i
can
go
into
the
liquor
store
and
it
says,
chardonnay
50
percent
off,
i
can
go
in
and
get
it
in
1
minute,
but
if
it's...
there's
just
all
that
wine
out
there,
and
i
don't
know
what
one
has
the
low
price
tag,
i'm
going
to
have
to
spend
more
time
in
the
liquor
shop?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
had
no
twenty
first
amendment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
are...
if
we
take
craig
v.
boren
as
our
model,
then
i
would
think
there's
not
too
much
to
your
twenty
first
amendment,
but
i
thought
you
were
relying
most
heavily
on
the
posadas
case
saying,
well,
twenty
first
amendment,
we
could
put
in
as
a
weight,
or
make
weight.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
our
concern
is,
how
do
we
keep
the
price
high,
let's
substitute
for
a
tax.
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
with
the
constitutional
problem
with
a
state
putting
a
higher
tax
on
liquor.
that
would
up
the
price
and
it
wouldn't
restrict
speech.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
far...
how
many
commodities
has
that
spread
to?
you
were
asked
about
guns.
what
about
butter?
what
is
the
line
between
what
the
state
can
discourage
and
what
it
can't?
