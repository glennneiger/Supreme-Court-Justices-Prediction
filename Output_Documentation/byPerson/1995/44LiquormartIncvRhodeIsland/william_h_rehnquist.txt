chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
94
1140,
44
liquormart,
inc.,
v.
rhode
island
and
rhode
island
liquor
stores
association.
mr.
lawson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
there's
no...
we
don't
apply
a
least
restrictive
means
test
in
that
fourth
prong
of
central
hudson,
so
to
show
that
something
else
might
have
been
done
isn't
enough,
i
don't
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
that
a
least
restrictive
means
approach?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
nonetheless
a
holding
that
the
appeal
raises
no
substantial
federal
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
they
could
ban
any
sale
or
consumption
of
liquor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
square
with
posadas,
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we're
not
here
to
evaluate
evidence.
i
mean,
we
generally
leave
that
to
lower
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
first
circuit
reversed
it,
and
we
generally
take
our
facts
from
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in--
--how
much
of
this
is
a
matter
of
evidentiary
proof,
the
way
the
stop
light
was
green,
or
the
stop
light
was
red?
isn't
there
a
certain
latitude
allowed
to
the
state
to
indulge
perhaps
a
common
sense
presumption
that
if
you
don't
advertize
the
price
of
liquor,
the
prices
will
remain
higher
and
therefore
not
as
much
will
be
sold?
how
many
witnesses
do
you
have
to
have
to
prove
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
supposing
i
budget
10
a
week
for
liquor.
rather
than
saying,
i'm
going
to
drink
one
glass,
i'm
going
to
drink
however
much
i
can
buy
for
10.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
you
be
sure
that
everyone
works
just
the
way
your
mind
does...
obviously
a
very
disciplined
fashion,
i'm
going
to
drink
so
much.
maybe
somebody
else
says
i've
got
10
in
my
weekly
budget
for
liquor--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
i'll
buy
however
much
i
can.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
we
ever
applied
bose
in
the
commercial
speech
area?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not,
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lawson.
ms.
partington.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
in
commercial
speech
cases?
have
we
shown
the
same
deference
to
the
first
amendment
as
we
have
in
noncommercial
speech
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
say
a
fifth
of
gilbey's
gin,
you
know
what's
in
there.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
partington.
mr.
lawson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lawson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94-1140,
44
liquormart
inc.
versus
rhode
island
will
be
1announced
by
justice
stevens.
