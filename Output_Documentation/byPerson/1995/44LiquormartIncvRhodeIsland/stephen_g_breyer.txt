justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
wonder
is,
if...
just
going
back
for
a
second
to
where
you
started,
suppose
that
a
state
thinks
the
following,
people
think
this
in
the
legislature
we
don't
mind
if
people
buy
liquor,
but
we're
worried
about
them
drinking
too
much,
and
we
don't
mind
if
the
price
is
high
or
if
small
retailers
make
a
lot
of
money,
because
they're
in
neighborhoods,
and
we're
afraid
that
if
there
are
a
lot
of
advertizing
for
price,
all
the
high
school
students
will
run
up
where
they
say
beer
at
half
price
this
week,
or
whiskey
reduced
30
percent.
and
we're
just
afraid
that
people
will
start
running
and
drink
more
when
they
see
those
advertized
specials
and
so
we
think
it's
a
sort
of
middle
position,
let
them
drink,
let
the
price
be
fairly...
a
little
higher
than
it
otherwise
would,
but
let's
stop
these
advertizings
of
specials,
et
cetera,
because
then
we
don't
get
as
many
drunken
drivers,
and
we
don't
get
as
much
abuse
of
the
product.
now,
suppose
that's
what
they
thought.
what's
the
state
supposed
to
do,
in
your
view,
under
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
that
it
can't
do
anything
about
this
problem
that
it
sees,
or
it
can't
implement
the
position
that
it's
reached?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
facts
are
just
exactly
what
i
said,
and
let's
also
say
they
go
into
court
and
they
make
out
a
plausible
case.
i
mean,
i
imagine
you
could
make
out
a
plausible
case
on
the
facts
for
that.
maybe
they
couldn't,
and
then
that
would
be
easy,
but
let's
assume
they
make
out
a
plausible
case
of
just
the
facts
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what's
the
law
supposed
to
allow
them
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
they
do
is,
they
go
and
do
what
i
said.
they
get
some
people
in
who
say,
look,
there
are
a
lot
of
ads
and
it's
common
sense
to
think
when
the
price
is
a
big
special
kids
will
run
up,
and
others,
and
buy
the
whiskey,
and
then
somebody
says,
you
haven't
actually
proved
it.
they
say,
yeah,
well,
we've
presented
enough.
i
mean,
that's
the
normal
state
of
those
things,
okay,
so
i
want
to
know
what
the
law
is
under
those
circumstances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
so
you're
saying
the
state's
powerless
in
that
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
what
they're
supposed
to
do
in
order
to
implement
all
the
hearings
before
the
legislature
that
bore
out
those
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
assume
there
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
get
at
what
the
state
really
should
do.
i'm
trying
to
make
the
world
real,
and
i
want
to
know--
--i
thought
what
you
said
they
should
do
is
that
they
should
set
a
minimum
price.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what's
worrying
me
is
that
so
often
these
turn
on,
like,
lawyer's
arguments
as,
there
was
14
inches
of
proof
on
this
side
and
12
files
of
evidence
on
the
other
side,
but
in
the
reality,
what
you
do
is,
you
get
witnesses
who
come
in
and
say,
sure,
kids
will
buy
more
liquor
if
you
advertize
half
price,
and
others
say,
we're
not
certain
of
that,
or
how
often.
now,
that's...
what
i
want
to
know
is,
given
the
state's
decision
that
that's
a
problem,
what,
in
your
opinion,
is
the
state
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
just
the
question
that's
bothering
me.
suppose
that
you
were...
i
understand
your
argument
to
be,
look,
banning
the
price
advertizing
is
better
than
the
tax,
because
when
you
advertize
prices
people
run
out
and
buy
the
thing
in
a
way
they
don't
with
the
tax,
and
of
course
price
controls
require
an
elaborate
administrative
mechanism
and
bring
a
host
of
problems
of
their
own.
so
suppose
i
accept
that,
and
say,
okay,
you
have
a
plausible
justification
here.
suppose
that's
what
the
constitution
held.
then
could
the
small
broccoli
producers,
or
the
small...
i
don't
know,
the
small
table
producers,
or
the
distributors,
or
virtually
any
product
under
the
sun
that
could
create
a
plausible
reason
why
the
product
has
some
negative
aspects
to
it,
do
exactly
the
same
thing
and
create
price
advertizing
bans
against
dozens
of
products?
i
mean,
is
your
product
special,
or
if
we
allow
the
ban
to
be
constitutional
here,
is
the
court
also
saying
that
price
advertizing
could
be
stopped
across
the
board
in
any
product
where
there
is
a
plausible
argument
that
too
much
use
of
the
product
by
a
group
would
be
harmful?
that's
what's
worrying
me.
is
this
a
special
product,
or
if
this
product
you
can
restrict
advertizing,
can
they
do
the
same
thing
with
plausible
reasons...
and
of
course
lots
of
producers
like
to
stop
advertizing,
if
they
can
agree
to
do
it...
across
the
board,
or
is
your
product
special,
and
if
so,
how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
food
products
that,
eaten
in
too
great
an
amount,
cause
diseases,
or
could
lead
to
overweight,
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or...
i
don't...
anything
that's
carcinogenic
in
large
doses
to
small
animals.
i
mean,
i'm
looking
for
the...
is
there
a
stopping
point,
or
is
this
to
authorize
lots
of
state
rules
that
would
in
effect
inhibit
price
competition?
