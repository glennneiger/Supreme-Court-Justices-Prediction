justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
this
state
is
it
legal
to
sell
liquor
to
high
school
kids?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
point,
could
i
just
interrupt
you
with
one
problem
that's
running
through
my
mind.
let's
assume
that
when
you
raise
prices,
there
will
be
less
consumption.
that
seems
fairly
common
sense.
but
i
gather
that...
assume
that
the
consumers
in
the
state,
85
percent
of
them
are
perfectly
temperate,
and
maybe
10
or
15
percent
are
abusive
drinkers,
and
you're
concerned
about
the
price
to
those
who
are
not
temperate.
do
you
think
that
raising
the
price
to
the
85
percent
who
may
be
perfectly
temperate,
who
may
not
consume
any
more,
keeping
the
price
up,
furthers
the
state
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
generally
it
would
be
affected.
let's
assume
that's
true,
but
how
do
you
know...
how
do
you
balance,
in
your
figuring
out
what
is
the
appropriate
thing
to
do,
the
impact
on
those
who
will
remain
temperate,
who
presumably
are
most
of
the
consumers,
and
the
minority
who
might
be
affected
by
it,
and
how
do
you
know
you're
being
successful
with
the
minority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
evidence
showed
there
were
only
5
percent
were
intemperate
drinkers,
would
that
make
any
difference,
that
you
make
the
95
percent
pay
more
anyway
because
you're
so
concerned
about
the
5
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
do
we
know
about
the
figure
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
general
question
in
terms
of
factual
basis
for
the
statute?
what
if
the
records
show...
and
i'm
not
going
to
suggest
it
does...
that
the
real
motivation
for
the
statute
was
to
protect
the
competitive
position
of
the
small
retailer,
and
to
enable
price
fixing
to
succeed
without
these
discounters
cutting
prices
all
the
time.
that's
really
what
motivated
it,
but
it
also
has
this
additional
support
that
you
can
say
it
tends
to
reduce
consumption.
would
that
affect
the
constitutional
analysis
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
peripheral
effect,
i'm
assuming
from
my
hypothetical,
and
i
guess
it's
alleged
in
one
count
of
the
complaint,
but
that
fell
by
the
wayside
somewhere,
that
the
real
background
to
the
statute
is,
it's
just
old
fashioned
price
fixing.
if
that
were
proved
and
assumed
to
be
the
fact,
would
that
affect
the
constitutional
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
though?
the
eleventh
amendment
always
interested
me,
and
in
this
case
i
notice
the
state
was
now
a
party
but
was
not
originally.
how
did
the
state
get
to
be
a
party
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
at
what
stage
of
the
proceedings
did
they
become
a
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
appeal
was
taken
in
the
name
of
the
state,
in
other
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
voluntarily
appeared
rather
than
your
bringing
them
in,
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
in
1956,
the
rhode
island
legislature
enacted
two
separate
prohibitions
against
advertising
the
retail
price
of
alcoholic
beverages.
the
first
applies
to
vendors
licensed
in
rhode
island
and
prohibits
them
from
advertising
“in
any
manner
whatsoever”
the
price
of
any
alcoholic
beverage
offered
for
sale
in
the
state
with
the
exception
of
price
tags
and
signs
located
on
the
licensed
establishment’s
premises
but
not
visible
from
the
street.
the
second
statute
applies
to
the
rhode
island’s
news
media
and
categorically
bans
the
publication
or
broadcast
of
advertisement
that
make
reference
to
the
price
of
any
alcoholic
beverages.
in
1991,
in
response
to
complaints
from
competitors
that
a
license
rhode
island
liquor
retailer
44
liquormart
was
advertising
the
prices
of
alcoholic
beverages.
the
state
brought
enforcement
proceedings
and
assess
the
$400.00.
44
liquormart
paid
the
fine
and
then
joined
by
peoples
super
liquor
stores,
a
massachusetts
liquor
retailer
patronize
by
rhode
island
residents,
initiated
this
action
in
federal
district
court.
they
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
two
state
laws
in
the
implementing
regulations
violates
the
first
amendment.
rhode
island
defended
the
price
advertising
prohibition
as
a
reasonable
means
of
serving
its
legitimate
interest
in
promoting
temper.
the
state
argued
that
the
advertising
prohibition
would
reduce
alcoholic
consumption
by
raising
the
retail
price
and
increasing
the
search
time
for
the
customers.
it
also
argued
that
its
determination
on
this
was
entitled
to
a
particular
deference
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
which
repeal
the
eighteenth
amendment
and
delegated
to
the
several
state
the
power
to
prohibit
commerce
in
or
the
use
of
alcoholic
beverages.
after
hearing
the
extensive
expert
testimony
on
the
question,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
state’s
pricing
price
advertising
prohibition
would
have
no
significant
impact
on
alcohol
consumption.
it
also
concluded
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
did
not
diminish
the
burden
that
the
first
amendment
ordinarily
imposes
on
the
state
when
it
seeks
to
regulate
the
dissemination
of
commercial
speech.
accordingly,
the
district
court
held
that
the
price
advertising
regulation
violated
the
first
amendment.
an
appeal
the
first
circuit
reversed.
it
found
the
inherent
merit
in
the
state's
contention
that
the
regulation
of
price
advertising
would
reduce
consumption.
relying
on
our
decision
in
california
against
larue,
the
first
circuit
also
concluded
that
twenty-first
amendment
gave
the
state’s
advertising
ban
an
added
presumption
of
validity.
the
first
circuit
then
held
that
under
this
court’s
decision
in
central
hudson,
posadas,
and
edge
broadcasting
the
state
prohibition
should
be
upheld.
alternatively,
the
first
circuit
concluded
that
our
summary
action
in
an
earlier
case
involving
a
regulation
of
price
advertising
in
ohio,
queensgate
investment
co.
compelled
the
same
conclusion.
we
granted
certiorari
to
give
more
thorough
analysis
to
the
importance
of
first
and
twenty-first
amendment
question
is
presented
by
the
regulation
of
liquor
price
advertising
then
we
provided
when
we
decline
to
accept
jurisdiction
of
the
queensgate
appeal.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
four
separate
opinions
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
now
unanimously
reverse
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals.
in
some
parts
of
my
opinion,
i
speak
for
the
majority
of
the
court
in
another
parts
for
only
a
plurality.
in
a
portion
of
the
opinion
that
does
command
the
majority,
we
hold
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
qualify
the
protections
afforded
by
the
first
amendment.
to
the
extent,
our
decision
in
california
v.
larue
to
the
contrary
we
disavow
its
reasoning.
in
another
portion
of
my
opinion
that
also
commands
the
majority
we
hold
that
rhode
island
has
failed
to
meet
the
“heavy
burden”
of
justifying
a
complete
ban
on
alcohol
price
advertising
that
the
first
amendment
has
made
applicable
to
the
several
states
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
imposes
on
attempts
to
restrict
commercial
speech
that
is
the
one
at
issue
here.
in
a
part
of
my
opinion
that
has
joined
only
by
justices
kennedy,
thomas,
and
ginsburg,
we
respond
that
the
state's
so-called
greater
includes
the
lesser
argument.
the
state
argues
that
because
it
has
the
broad
power
to
prohibit
any
sales
of
alcoholic
beverages,
it
must
also
possess
the
lesser
power
to
restrict
advertisement
offering
such
beverages
for
sale.
although
we
do
not
dispute,
the
proposition
that
greater
powers
include
lesser
one,
we
disagree
we
the
suggestion
that
the
state's
power
to
regulate
commercial
activity
is
greater
than
its
power
to
ban
truthful
nonmisleading
commercial
speech.
contrary
to
the
major
premise
of
the
state’s
argument,
we
think
that
it
quite
clear
that
banning
speech
may
sometimes
prove
far
more
intrusive
than
banning
conduct.
we
reject
the
assumption
that
words
are
necessary
less
vital
to
freedom
than
actions
or
that
logic
somehow
proves
that
the
power
to
prohibit
an
activity
is
necessary
greater
than
the
power
to
suppress
speech
about
it.
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
doctrine,
the
state's
syllogism
is
untenable.
the
text
of
the
first
amendment
makes
clear
that
the
constitution
presume
those
attempts
to
regulate
speech
are
more
dangerous
than
attempts
to
regulate
conduct.
that
presumption
accords
that
the
essential
role
that
the
free
flow
of
information
plays
in
a
democratic
society.
as
a
result,
the
first
amendment
directs
the
government
may
not
suppress
speech
as
easily
as
it
may
suppress
conduct
and
the
speech
restrictions
can
not
be
treated
as
simply
another
means
that
the
government
may
use
to
achieve
its
ends.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
souter
and
justice
breyer
has
joined;
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
each
also
filed
separate
opinions
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
