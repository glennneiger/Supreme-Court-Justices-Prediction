ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
state
of
rhode
island
has
adopted
an
advertizing
ban
on
the
price
of
alcoholic
beverages
that
meets
this
court's
test
for
restrictions
on
free
speech,
and
commercial
speech
in
particular,
and
that
is
what
we
have
here,
is
commercial
speech,
which
is
entitled
to
a
lesser
degree
of
protection
than
other
forms
of
noncommercial
speak.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
under
the
twenty
first
amendment
separately,
it
probably
could,
but
that's
not
a
commercial
speech
question,
because
that's
not
proposing
a
commercial
transaction
from
seller
to
buyer,
so
i
think
you
have
other
concerns,
other
than
a
first
amendment
concern
in
that
case.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
that
would
probably...
the
way
i
interpret
that
would
be
a
free
speech
question,
not
a
commercial
speech
question,
and
i
think
the
standard
would
be
different.
however,
this
court
has
taught,
as
discussed
earlier,
and
it's
the
state's
position
that
if
you
can
totally
ban
the
sale
of
a
product
you
can
ban
advertizements,
but
i
have
trouble
seeing
that
as
commercial
speech.
i
think
that's
more
of
an
opinion,
and
that
the
state
would
be
hard
pressed
to
restrict
that
sort
of
speech.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
i
still
don't
think
the
fact
that...
again,
this
court
has
said
in
the
case
of
where
there
is
a
book
or
a
pamphlet
that
discusses
sales
of
this
and
that,
that
doesn't
make
it
commercial
speech
just
because
you
sell
a
book
about
something.
there
has
to
be
proposing
a
commercial
transaction,
and
that's
the
very
limited
area
we're
in
here
today,
so
i
think
that
those
two
situations
are
different.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
of
banning
it
in
newspapers?
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
not
unless
it
became
commercial
speech.
i
don't
think
the
size
of
the
audience
is
a
factor
in
the
central
hudson
test.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
happened
immediately
before
this
case
came
up
to
this
court.
one
of
the
newspapers
in
this
state
did
a
story
and
most
of
it
was
focused
on
the
difference
in
prices
among
liquor
stores
and
they
did,
as
part
of
that
story,
as
part
of
that
news
piece,
run
prices,
and
our
liquor
control
administrator
would
not
find
that
that
was
a
violation,
because
that
is
not
proposing
a
commercial
transaction.
i
realize
there's
a
line
there,
but
i
think
that
was
easy
to
distinguish.
they
were
discussing
the
difference
between
prices
in
rhode
island
and
massachusetts.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
i
suppose
that
if
it
rose
to
the
level
of
an
advertizement,
or
if
it
appeared
that
some
of
the
liquor
retailers
were
attempting
to
subvert
the
advertizement
requirement,
or
the
advertizing
ban,
then
the
state
could
take
some
action,
but
this...
the
example
that
you've
given
me,
the
facts
that
happened
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
were
so
very
clearly
part
of
a
newsworthy
event
that
was
taking
place
that
the
ban
did
not
apply.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
not
under
the
ban
as
it
exists
today,
i
don't--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--yes,
i
believe
they
could.
under
the
twenty
first
amendment,
i
think
the
state
has
a
separate
basis
for
dealing
with
all
manner
of
discussion
involving
alcoholic
beverages.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
if
we
had
no
twenty
first
amendment
a
state
still
has
considerable
police
powers
and
has
always
had
considerable
police
powers
in
dealing
with
alcoholic
beverages.
since
the
mid
1800's
this
nation's
history
has
always
given
the
state
considerable
police
power
to
regulate
the
sales
of
alcoholic
beverages.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
more
than
toothpaste,
yes.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
oh,
i'm
sorry--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--the
twenty
first
amendment
gives
the
state,
this
court
has
said,
something
more
than
the
ordinary
police
power,
and--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--with--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--the
court
has
repeatedly,
in
cases
not
dealing
with
commercial
speech,
and
this
is
the...
from
what
i
can
tell
the
court's
first
commercial
speech
state
twenty
first
amendment
case
in
recent
years.
the
twenty
first
amendment,
acting
together
with...
and
the
state
would
make
an
argument
that
the
twenty
first
amendment
together
with
the
fact
that
alcoholic
beverages
are
involved
here,
and
they
are
not
one
argument
but
two,
gives
the
state
considerable
regulatory
power
here
and
assists
the
state
in
meeting
the
central
hudson
test.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
absolutely,
and
that
takes
me
back
to
applying
the
central
hudson
test,
and
i
think
in
answer
to
a
couple
of
the
questions
i
heard
earlier,
it
is
not
a
question
of
who
presents
the
most
evidence,
it's
a
question
of
could
the
state
and
can
the
state
reasonably
believe
that
by
banning
price
advertizing
the
substantial
and
legitimate
state
interests
will
be
advanced?
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
well,
i
read
that
requirement
in
rubin,
which,
by
the
way,
suggested
a
marketing
ban
on
the...
regarding
the
strength
of
beer
as
a
feasible
alternative
to
the
labeling
ban...
i
read
rubin
and
i
read
that
together
with
the
florida
bar
case,
which
cautioned
that
in
every
case
we
do
not
have
to
have
a
mountain
of
scientific
evidence.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
correct.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
first
of
all,
the
florida
bar
case
said
that
you
can
rest
a
reasonable
belief
on
data,
studies,
history,
and
common
sense.
we
have
all
of
that
present
in
this
case.
we
have
many
things--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
that...
not
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
your
honor.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
i
think
that
it
goes
back
to,
and
the
state
would
argue
that
it
has
to
be
a
reasonable
belief
on
the
state's
part--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--that
it
would
be
advanced.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
not
to
weigh
the
evidence,
but
to
see
if
the
state
put
forth
some
evidence
that
could
support
the
reasonable
belief,
but
in--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--correct,
and
i
think
the
fifth--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--the
fifth
circuit
in
the
dunagin
case--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--the
appellate
courts
in
a
first...
yes,
sir,
that
the
appellate
courts
in
a
first
amendment
case
have
a
special
role
not
to
review
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
but
to
see
whether
a
reasonable
basis
exists,
and
they
made
the
distinction...
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
recently
in
the
anheuser
busch
case
made
the
determination
between
the
adjudicative
and
the
legislative
facts,
and
that
is
the
state's
argument
here
today
that
as
long
as
there
is
a
reasonable
belief,
and
we
are
not
limited
to
our
record
below--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--yes,
and
i
would
like
to
tell--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--all
right.
i
would
like
to
point
you
to
several
factors
in
this
case
that
support
that
reasonable
belief.
in
addition
to
the
testimony
and
the
data,
the
studies
the
state
put
forward
which
were
based
on
generally
accepted
and
well
established
economic
principles--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
that
the
testimony
we
have
is
that
consumption
generally--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
that
that's
a
point
the
experts
made
here.
you
cannot
study
this
subject
in
that
detail.
you
cannot
know
exactly
which
part
of
your
society
that
you're
affecting.
all
of
the
experts
said
this
was
a
very
difficult
area
to
study,
and
that
the
generally
accepted
economic
principles
apply
to
alcohol.
we
have
to
look
at
it
in
a
much
larger
picture
if
consumption
is--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
that
that
sort
of
figure
would
go
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
legislature's
belief.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
we
do
not
know,
because
all
of
our
experts
said
that
those
figures
would
be
impossible
to
compile,
so
it
comes
down
to
whose
decision
should
it
be
to
make
this
social
policy?
should
it
be
the
legislators
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
or
the
liquor
retailers
in
the
state
of
rhode
island?
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
i
don't
think
that
minimum
prices--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--and
in
addressing
mr.
lawson's...
the
narrowness
issue
and
the
minimum
price
problems,
i
don't
think,
and
i
disagree
that
the
minimum
price
would
be
as
effective
as
this.
number
1,
there
is
a
constitutional
problem
in
minimum
retail
prices,
and
this
court
has
previously
held
that.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
this
court,
i
believe
mid--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
that
the
schemes
that
have
been
propounded
by
states
in
the
past
have
had
constitutional
problems,
and
also
they
don't--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
minimum
retail
prices,
and
to
answer
a
couple
of
questions
that
came
during
the
petitioner's
argument,
minimum
retail
prices
simply
would
not
work
as
well
in
this
case.
they--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
why
wouldn't
a--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--historically,
in
the
minimum
retail
price
area
the
states
have
been
affecting
prices
in
other
states
and
other
areas
of
the
country,
and
that
has
been
held
to
be
improper
and
unacceptable
even
with
the
twenty
first
amendment.
i
am
not
arguing
that
the
twenty
first
amendment
is
absolute
or
that
it
trumps
the
first
amendment
in
this
case.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
and
it
wouldn't
work
as
well,
because
it
wouldn't
remove
the
artificial
inducement
to
consume
that
an
advertizement
constitutes.
the
artificial
inducement--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--it
is
the
state's
position,
and
it
is
a
reasonable
belief
that
would
support
this
ban,
that
those
citizens
who
are
already
so
inclined
to
consume
will
purchase
no
matter
what.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
oh,
i
absolutely
think--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--that
a
state
can...
a
total
advertizing
ban
would
be
constitutional.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
i
think
that--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--the
rule
as
i
understand
it
is,
and
the
first
amendment
has
been
afforded
a
lot
of
special
consideration
by
this
court,
and
again,
set
out
in
the
dunagin
footnote
better
than
i'm
saying
it
today,
obviously,
is
that
appellate
courts
in
a
first
amendment
case
bear
a
special
role
in
reviewing
the
lower
courts.
you're
not
bound
by
their
evidence.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
and
i
think
in
craig--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--well,
i
think
in
the
past
this
court
has
accepted--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
this
court
has
always
held
a
special
place
for
the
first
amendment
in
the
law--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--that
i
have
read
it,
perhaps
other
amendments
are
entitled
to
a
great
deal
of
deference.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
no,
and
i
think
that's
just
the
point
about
the
commercial
speech
doctrine,
and
that
is,
the
state's
position
is
that
it
is
not
as
protected
because
it
is
proposing
a
commercial
transaction,
in
this
case
a
transaction,
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages,
a
highly
regulated
commodity.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
i
think
as
long
as
the
state's
asserted
interest
in
this
case
is
substantial,
and
is
advanced,
and
the
state
could
reasonably
have
believed
it
was
advanced,
the
peripheral
effect
on
the
distribution
scheme
and
on
the
small
retailers
and
the
large
retailers
and
their
relationship--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
it
would
under
the
substantial
interest
test,
or
the
substantial
interest
prong
of
central
hudson,
could
protection
of
the
smaller
retailers
be
a
substantial
interest.
fortunately,
we
don't
have
to
determine
that
here.
the
substantial
interest
has
been
stipulated
to.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
i
think
our
product
is
quite
special
because
of
this
nation's
regulatory
history
of
alcoholic
beverages.
if
some
other
product
were
to
have
the
history
that
alcoholic
beverages
has,
including
a
total
prohibition
of
sales
of
that
product
in
the
nation
for
a
period
of
years--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
if
we
met
the
central
hudson
test
we
would
then
have
to
create
more
of
a
legislative
history
in
this
case
than
we
had
to
in
the
gun
case.
in
the
liquor
case,
you
have
a
history
prepared
for
us.
it's
out
there.
it's
been
established
by--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--they
intervened
on
the
side
of
the
state,
correct.
the
state's
interest
is
in
the
constitutionality
of
this
law,
and
we
believe
it
is,
because
it
is
a
reasonable
belief,
and
beforehand
i
was
setting
out
those
factors
that
supported
the
state's
reasonable
belief.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
for
instance,
like
red
meat.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
i
think
at
this
point
in
history,
alcoholic
beverages
stand
in
a
unique
position,
because
of
the
history
and
because
it's
the
only
grant
of
power
to
the
states,
the
twenty
first
amendment,
to
regulate--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--no,
you
have
not.
however,
in
the
larkin
case,
which
was
a
first
amendment
case,
not
a
free
speech
case,
you
did
state
that
in
the
area
of...
that
larkin
was
concerned
with,
the
state's
regulation
of
alcoholic
beverages
deserves
great
deference.
and
i
would
say
at
this
point
the
twenty
first
and
first
amendments
are
both
part
of
the
same
constitution,
as
was
said
in
the
craig
v.
boren
case,
and
a
reasonable
accommodation
was
made
here
that
is
sufficiently
narrow,
i
think--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--well,
as
i
was
saying--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--and
i
think
it
might
be
a
mistake
to
limit
my
position
to
saying
the
twenty
first
amendment
gives
us
power.
it
gives
a
lot
more.
it...
the
twenty
first
amendment
should
weave
in
and
out
of
the
central
hudson
test,
and
the
alcoholic
beverages
should
weave
in
and
out
of
the
central
hudson
test,
again,
as
providing
a
history--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
central
hudson
test
has
been
met
by
the
state
in
this
case
irrespective
of--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--the
state's
asserted
interest
in
the
statute
is
the
promotion
of
temperance
and
the
reasonable
control
in
the
traffic
of
alcoholic
beverages.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
well,
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
this
as
indirect,
because
i
think
as
the
fourth
circuit
recently
said
in
the
anheuser
busch
case,
and
this
court
said,
marketing
and
advertizing
are
a
direct
link
to
consumption.
and
in
this
case,
and
as
taught
in
prior
cases
and
decisions
by
this
court
beginning...
i
would
refer
to
the
bates
case,
where
this
court
says
that
price
advertizing
often
leads
to
dramatically
lower
prices
for
the
consumer,
and
using
the
history
of
alcoholic
beverages,
those
opinions,
our
testimony--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
the
line
would
be
those...
from
my
cases,
alcoholic
beverages
is
unique,
because
of,
again,
the
regulatory
history
of
this
country
and
the
social
problems
caused
by
alcoholic
beverages,
and
the
focus
that
the
constitution
has
had
on
alcoholic
beverages...
two
constitutional
amendments.
this
court
has
mentioned
other
items
and
goods
as,
and
we've
discussed
it
in
this
case,
as
vices,
and
i
think
that--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--i
think
the
history
of
alcoholic
beverage
regulation
and
the
general
police
powers,
i
think--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--no.
i
think
posadas
explicitly
found
that
since
the
state,
or
since
puerto
rico
could
ban
gambling
altogether,
the
restriction
on
speech
was
permissible
as
long
as
the
central
hudson
test--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--that
has
been
one
of
the
arguments
of
the
state
up
until
this
point.
however,
footnote
2
in
rubin
convinced
me
that
perhaps
to
set
out
to
prove
that
the
central
hudson
test
had
been
met
was
perhaps
the
wisest
and
simplest
way
to
go
about
this
case,
and
the
state
believes
that
the
central
hudson
test
has
been
met.
we
also
believe
that
the
greater
power
to
ban
does
include
the
lesser,
but
that
we
need
not
reach
that
point
in
this
case
today.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
let
me
try
to
explain
what
i
was--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
it
doesn't
tell
you
about
the
product
itself.
it
doesn't
tell
you
what's
contained
in
that
bottle,
or
in
that
can,
as
did
the
information
in
rubin.
rubin
involved
information
about
the
product
itself,
and
price
advertizing--
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
--no.
i
think
that
would
be
a
mistake.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
some
people
might.
as
far
as
the
quality
of
the
product,
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
product,
the
smoothness,
the
taste,
no.
that
is
different
from
price.
price
does
not
tell
you
how
good
a
product
it
is,
how
long
it
was
in
the
barrel,
et
cetera.
i
think
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
convey
by
that
to
distinguish
the
information
in
this
case
from
the
rubin
case.
ms.
rebecca
t.
partington
absolutely
not,
and
that
takes
us
back
to
the
reason
and
the
basis
for
this
statute,
and
that
is
what
the
testimony
is
here.
although
the
advertizing
is
questionable,
the
effect
of
price
is
not.
thank
you.
