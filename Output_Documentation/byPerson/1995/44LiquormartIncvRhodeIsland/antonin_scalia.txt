justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
the
same
here.
it's
not
all
advertizing.
it's
advertizing
a
price.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
advertize
liquor
all
you
like,
just
not
the
price.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
is
posadas
distinguished?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
we
resurrecting
lochner
here?
why
couldn't
the
state
say
no
opticians...
is
there
some...
is
lochner
back
with
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
could
ban
toothpaste
if
it
wanted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
a
constitutional
provision
on
toothpaste?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
some
point
you
get
to
lochner,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
saying
whether
it
would,
i'm
saying
whether
it
could.
i
don't
think
any
state
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
want
to
run
on
that
ticket.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
point
is,
you
would
say
that
if
the
state
could
ban
toothpaste,
and
let's
assume
it
could
unless
you
believe
in
lochner,
it
still
nonetheless
could
not
ban
toothpaste
advertizing
so
long
as
it
did
not
ban
toothpaste.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you'd
say
liquor
is
no
different
from
toothpaste.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
hard
position
to
maintain,
i
suppose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
liquor
is
no
different
from
toothpaste.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
wouldn't
restrict
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
the
same
effect
and
not
restrict
speech.
i
thought
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
everything
just
comes
down
to
an
evidentiary
question,
then.
i
thought
there
was
a
point
of
principle
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
i
thought
that
the
response
to
justice
breyer's
question
was,
the
state
may
require
low
prices...
may
require
high
prices,
but
if
it
permits
low
prices,
it
may
not
prevent
people
from
telling
about
low
prices
because
that's
a
restriction
of
speech.
you
may
do
the
one,
but
you
may
not
do
the
other.
i
thought
that
was
the
point
of
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
the
state
may
not
have
the
motive
that
justice
breyer--
--thank
you.
--attributes
to
it.
[laughter]
but
you've
also...
mr.
lawson,
you've
also
got
a
requirement,
i
suppose,
at
least
in
the
light
of
rubin
and
coors,
of
proof
that
there
in
fact
will
be
a
material
degree
of
advancement
of
the
state's
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
these
bars
that
have
happy
hours
don't
know
what
they're
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
just
throwing
money
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
low
prices
do
not
increase
the
volume
of
sales--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a
novel
economic
theory.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--more
than
toothpaste?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
that's
in
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
apart
from
the
twenty
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
respect
to
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
respect
to
the
demands
of
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
it
does,
but
where
in
it
does
it
say
that
it
somehow
increases
the
state's
authority
under
the
first
amendment,
or
in
the
face
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
making
the
95
percent
pay
more
is
no
problem.
the
state
can
do
that
without
any
difficulty,
can't
it?
i
mean,
it
could
set
minimum
prices.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
make
the
95
percent
pay
more,
and
there
would
be
no
problem
at
all.
you
can
always
make
people
pay
more.
the
only
thing
you
can't
do
is
withhold
information
from
them
in
some
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
mrs.
partington,
can
i...
i'm
not
sure
what
the
scope
of
the
concession
that
you
made
to
justice
souter
earlier
was.
do
i
take
it
that
you
acknowledge
that
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment,
as
opposed
to
other
constitutional...
claimed
constitutional
violations,
we
have
some
special
authority
to
make
factual
determinations
on
our
own
and
disregard
factual
determinations
reasonably
made...
reasonably,
but
we
disagree
with
it,
made
by
state
legislatures,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
first
amendment
different
from
other
amendments
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
that?
i
mean,
more
than
other
constitutional...
let's
say
a
violation
of
equal
protection,
or
discrimination
against
someone
because
of
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
first
amendment's
different.
we
would
not
accept
judgments
of
legislatures
in
that
area
that
we
would
with
respect
to
the
other
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
sort
of
a
privileged
amendment,
is
it...
i
mean,
the
first
amendment?
all
the
others
are
disfavored.
i
don't
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
our
hearts?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
what
the
twenty...
the
twenty
first
amendment
seems
to
me
entirely
irrelevant.
the
only
operative
provision
here
is,
the
transportation
or
importation
into
any
state
for
delivery
or
use
therein
of
intoxicating
liquors
in
violation
of
the
laws
thereof
is
hereby
prohibited.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
see
what
power
that
gives
to
the
states.
it
just
says
that
it's
unlawful
to
bring
into
the
state
something
that's
against
the
state's
alcohol
laws,
but
they're
not
given
any
new
powers
over
alcohol.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
surely
that's
up
to
the
people
of
the
state.
i
mean,
the
people
of
one
state
may
really
be
dead
against
drinking
too
much,
and
people
of
another
state
may
be
vegetarians
and
they're
really
dead
against
people
eating
red
meat.
isn't
that
a
matter
of
policy
that
the
citizens
of
a
state
are
able
to
adopt
on
their
own,
and
what
this
state
can
do
because
it
hates
alcohol,
surely
another
state
should
be
able
to
do
because
it
hates
red
meat.
that's
up
to
the
citizens
of
the
state,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
is
there
something
up
in
the
sky
that
says
alcohol
has
to
be
hated
and
red
meat
doesn't?
