justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
said,
by
the
way,
in
delaware,
breyer
got
that
piece
of
paper,
and
i
say
in
the
ninth
circuit,
no,
breyer
never
even
got
it.
they
sent
it
to
the
wrong
address.
now,
is
breyer
bound
by
that
finding
in
delaware,
and
shutts
says
he
is...
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
they
said
that
it
was,
but
what
i
want
to
show
is,
not
only
is
it
not
the
best
notice,
it's
horrible.
it
all
went
to
the
north
pole.
of
course
breyer
didn't
get
his
notice.
i'm
bound?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
shutts--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
case
that
says
i'm
bound.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
because
i
never
got
it.
they
sent
it
to
the
north
pole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
bound
by
the
finding
that
it
was
the
best
notice
practicable--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i've
never
heard
of
this
case
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
have
a
divorce,
and
my
divorce
is
in
delaware,
and
i
give
my
wife
the
right
to
use
the
malibu
beach
house
as
part
of
the
settlement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
can't
i
do
that,
and
couldn't
it
be
included
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
decree,
and
it
all
is
in
california,
all
this
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
did...
they
don't
have
jurisdiction
here
over
the
parties.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
do
they...
all
right.
my
point
is,
i
don't
quite
see...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
three
separate
arguments.
the
release
argument
i
don't
understand,
because
the
word
release
is
written
right
into
the
judgment.
we're
talking
about
a
judgment,
not
a
contract.
i
don't
really
understand
the
argument
of...
i
mean,
the
williams
act
seems
to
be
a
separate
argument.
the
williams
act...
you
have
a
lot
of
federal
statutes,
like
the
antitrust
statute
and
others,
which
are
exclusive.
i
mean,
the
state
courts
cannot
approve
any
settlement
that
involves
giving
up
any
of
these
federal
claims?
why?
i
mean,
why
not?
they
can
approve
my
giving
up
my
beach
house.
they
can
approve
my
giving
up
all
kinds
of
things
in
a
settlement.
why
can't
they
approve
my
giving
up
a
class
action
that's
worth
$300?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
there
are
conceptual--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--differences,
but
my
point
is
simply--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
my
point
is
simply
that
in
settlements
people
give
up
all
kinds
of
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
have
nothing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
do
with
the
case
in
front
of
the
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if,
in
fact,
they
can
give
up
all
kinds
of
things,
including
beach
houses,
including
mineral
rights
somewhere,
why,
assuming
the
due
process
clause
is
satisfied--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can't
they
give
up
a
class
action
right
to
some
case,
probably
would
never
be
broader,
if
it
was
it
would
be
worth
$300
to
them?
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
what
in
the
law
would
allow
you
to
give
up
thousands
of
things,
like
houses,
et
cetera,
but
you
couldn't
give
up
some
kind
of
class
action
right
that's
not
worth
too
much
to
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
yes,
that's
called
the
due
process
problem.
i'm
leaving
that
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
course
that's--
--mr.
monaghan,
let's...
i'm
sorry.
no,
please.
just
exactly
the
point.
you're
right
on
the
point
that
was
worrying
me
when
i
asked
that.
this
is
the
part
i
don't
understand.
of
course
you
can
exercise
a
release
to
a
contract
without
a
judgment,
but
why
couldn't
you
also
put
it
in
a
judgment,
and
if
you
also
put
it
in
a
judgment,
why
wouldn't
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
require
that
judgment
to
bind
other
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
summarize
in
one
sentence,
say
a
properly
constituted
class
representative
in
a
state
court
where
the
proceedings
are
completely
fair,
so
there's
no
due
process--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--problem
can
bind
the
members
of
his
class
to
give
up
state
claims,
maybe
even
to
pay
some
money
in
an
appropriate
circumstance,
but
cannot
bind
those
members
to
give
up
some
kind
of
federal
claim
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
it's
all
the
williams
act.
in
other
words,
unless
we
find
a
congressional
intent
there
in
section
27,
you
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
section
27,
unless
because
of
section--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
that's
what
this
turns
on.
