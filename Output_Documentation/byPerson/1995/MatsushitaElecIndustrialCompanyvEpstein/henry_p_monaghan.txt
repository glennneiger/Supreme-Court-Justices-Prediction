mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
my
argument
basically
has
two
prongs.
first,
i'd
like
to
go
into
the
issue
of
adequate
representation
and,
secondly,
i'd
like
to
convince
the
court
that
in
fact,
in
view
of
the
reply
briefs,
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
there's
no
marrese
issue
involved
at
all
in
the
case.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
your
honor,
two
points.
i
think
first
of
all,
we
are
respondents,
and
we
can
defend
the
judgment
on
any
ground
consistent
with
the
record.
this
point
was
the
central
point
of
our
argument
below.
secondly,
even
if
we
were
in
the
petitioner's
point
of
view,
are
in
that
position,
this
question
is
fairly
included
within
the
petition.
the
real
question
in
the
case...
and
they've
reframed
their
question,
incidentally,
from
their
brief
to
their
reply
brief.
the
real
question
is,
did
the
ninth
circuit
disregard
erroneously
what
happened
in
delaware?
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
can't
release
those
claims,
your
honor,
if
in
doing
so
it
would
violate
the
due
process
clause.
they
conceded
that.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
ninth--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--well,
i
think...
well,
all
i
can
say
is,
your
honor,
that
whether
or
not
that's
the
question
that
they
presented
on
certiorari,
there
was
countless
case
law
in
this
court
that
we
can
defend
a
judgment--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--on
any
ground
consistent
with
the
record.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
oh,
i'm--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--i--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--well--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--i
will
go
exactly
to
the
question--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i'm
perfectly...
i
will
turn
exactly
to
that
point,
your
honor.
the...
there's
a
wide
difference
between
an
individual
releasing
a
claim
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
a
class
representative
that's
happy
to
do
so.
when
the
individual
releases
his
claim,
the
state
court
judgment
is
not
what
effectuates
the
release.
the
individual
could
release
his
claim
sitting
in
his
rocking
chair.
the
fact
that
he
does
so
as
part
of
a
proceeding
before...
as
part
of
a
judgment,
the
judgment
isn't
what
effectuates
the
release.
the
judgment
in
the
state
court
has
one
advantage.
it
converts
him
from
what
would
otherwise
be
a
simple
contract
creditor
into
a
judgment
creditor
which
may
give
him
affirmative
rights
under
the
state
lien
law.
but
when
an
individual
releases
his
claim,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
mitsubishi
case,
he's
a)
under
no
obligation
to
pursue
it
at
all,
and
he
can
release
it
outside
the
legal
framework,
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
he
can't
authorize
it
inside
the
framework.
in
this
case,
what
happened
is
the
class
representative
gets
his
authority
solely
by
virtue
of
his
appointment.
the
complaint
is
organized
entirely
around
state
law
claims.
we
cannot
understand
how
it
is
that
the
state
court,
which
could
not
adjudicate
the
claims,
could
license
a
representative
to
go
out,
value
those
claims,
badger
the
defendant,
value
them,
and
then
authorize
a
release
of
those
claims.
this
is
directly
inconsistent
with
section
27.
if
you
will
take
a
look--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--because
the
supremacy
clause
forbids
it.
section
27
forbids
it.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
federal
law
is
not
silent
on
it
in
our
view,
your
honor.
section
27
provides
for
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
enforce
these
claims
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
if
i
can...
and
the
question
is,
what
does
that
mean?
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
question
analytically
is
whether
a
settlement
in
these
circumstances
amounts
to
an
enforcement
of
the
claim.
if
you
think
about
the
structure
of
this
case,
you
had
nonexistent
state
law
claims.
they
were
revived
at
the
last
hour
in
a
hope
to
extinguish
a
substantial
federal
appeal.
all
that
occurred
here
in
the
chancery
court
was
a
valuation
of
the
worth
of
the
federal
claims.
when--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--we
are
prepared
to
defend
that
position
here.
we
could
adopt
a
narrower
position,
which
is
the
ninth
circuit's
position,
which
the
state
court
certainly
can't
do
it
with
respect
to
claims
which
don't
overlap,
and
there's
no
contention
here
that
the
claims
overlap.
delaware--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--i'm
perfectly
happy
to
reach
that
point,
your
honor.
that's
the
way
to
vindicate
the
congressional
judgment.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
there
are
a
great
many
ways
of
coordinating...
first
of
all,
we
should
not
exaggerate
the
significance
of
the
problem.
there
are
no
more
than
300
securities
class
actions
brought
per
year
in
the
federal
court,
300.
there
are
presumably
about
145
defendants
being
sued.
this
information
is
collected
in
a
recent
article
in
the
columbia
law
review.
what
would
happen
in
those
circumstances
is
that
the
state
court...
you
could
file
simultaneous
suits
in
both
the
state
and
federal
court.
you
could
file
the
suit
in
the
federal
court
alone.
if
the
argument
ultimately
is
one
of
efficiency,
i
would
say,
your
honor,
you...
it's...
you
shouldn't
just
focus
on
efficiency
of
litigation
costs.
you
ought
to
look
at
efficiency
of
outcomes.
if
the
state
court
cannot
adjudicate
the
claims,
it
will
systematically
undervalue
the
federal
claims.
you
can't
be
a
good
diplomat
if
you
haven't
got
the
power
to
wage
war.
but
i'd
go
a
step
further,
and
i
would
say
this.
even
if
the
court
were
convinced
that
this
is
an
inefficient
solution,
this
is
the
solution
that
expresses
congress'
will,
in
our
judgment.
congress
said
enforcement
is
in
the
federal...
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
if
you
will
look
at
point
1
of
their
briefs,
the
heading
of
point
1--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
page
15.
this
is
how
they
describe
the
question
a
grant
of
exclusively
federal
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
claims.
this
is
not
what
the
statute
says,
and
they've
underlined
the
word
adjudicate.
we
quote
the
statute
on
the
opening
page
of
our
brief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
70
pages
of
their
brief,
they
never
quote
section
27.
you
can't
find
it.
you
can't
find
the
text
of
it.
the...
on
the
opening
page
of
our
brief,
this
is
the
statute,
and
my
view
is
that
i
cannot
understand
how
a
court
which
cannot
adjudicate
claims
somehow
gets
the
authority
to
appoint
a
representative
to
do
what
congress
has
forbidden
the
court
to
do.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
mm
hmm.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
you've
got
personal--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--you've
got
personal
jurisdiction
over
both
of
those
defendants.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
they
do
not
have...
they
have
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
parties,
but
they
do
not
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
claims.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
beach
house
example
is
a
case
of
intrastate
federal--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--right.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
when
you're
talking
about--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--individual--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--right.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--mm
hmm.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
your
honor,
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
an
individual
giving
up
something
and
a
class
representative.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no,
it's
not
the
due
process
clause.
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
the
due
process
clause,
with
deference.
the
due
process
clause
claim
is
involved,
but
if
i'm
an
individual
and
i
have
an
antitrust
claim,
and
i
have
10
state
law
claims
against
you,
i
can
release
them
all
by
way
of
a
general
settlement.
it
can
be
put
into
the
decree
in
the
state
court,
but
the
decree
in
the
state
court
doesn't
do
anything
with
respect
to
releasing
the
federal
claim.
it's
my
contract
release.
this
is
newton
v.
rumery,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
the
judgment
isn't
what
releases
it.
it's
the
contract,
the
agreement
that
releases--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--because
there
are
plenty
of
federal
claims,
your
honor,
and
we
cite
two
cases,
dicey
and
rumery,
in
which
a
release
is
effected
without
any
kind
of
a
judgment.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
a
condition
on
the
contract.
that's
a
condition
on
the
contract,
but
what
is
effecting
your
release
from
a
federal
point
of
view
is
not
the
judgment,
it
is...
although
the
person
now
becomes
a
judgment
lienor,
as
i
said,
but
what
effects
it
is
the
fact
that
he
made
a
contract.
he
could
make
it...
he
could
make
that
same
contract
without
any
reference
to
a
court
at
all.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
if
you
put
it
in
a
judgment,
you
get
the
status
of
a
judgment
lienor,
to
start
with,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
if
it's
exclusively
within
the...
if
the
claim
is
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
there
can
be
no
claim
preclusion.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
think--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--yes.
i
think
marrese
disposed
of
that
problem
negatively.
that's
exactly
the
argument...
that's
exactly
what
judge
posner
did
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
marrese.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
he
made
exactly
that
argument.
he
conceded
that
section
1738
would
not
bar
the
federal
claim.
he
then
decided
to
fashion
a
preclusion
rule
broader
than
the
state
preclusion
rule,
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
that
case
he
was
reversed
on.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the...
but
i
would
say
that
in
this
case
i
think
it's
very
important,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
class
actions
particularly,
to
understand
that
the
state
class
representative
gets
his
authority
from
the
complaint
and
from
the
complaint
only.
the
complaint
is
organized
only
around
state
law
claims.
if
that's
all
he
has
by
way
of...
all
the
state
can
give
him,
i
don't
understand
how
he
suddenly
bootstraps
himself
up
in--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
individuals
can
do
this,
your
honor.
you
have...
if
i...
there's
a...
i
have
to
come
back
again,
and
i
don't
want
to
sound
like
a
broken
record.
individuals
can
do
this
as
a
matter
of
contract
law.
that's
settled,
because
they
can
do
it
outside
court,
they
can
do
it
inside
the
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it's
not
conferring
jurisdiction
on
the
state
court,
your
honor.
what
it's
doing
is,
it's
making
a
contract
with
the
defendant,
and
the
state
court
is
approving
it.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
representative
must...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
your
honor.
there
are...
a
guardian
ad
litem,
for
example.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
if
we
opted
out,
there
were
two
consequences
of
opting
out.
first
of
all,
our
own
individual
claim
would
be
not
viable.
we
couldn't
have
prosecuted
that
claim
even
if
the
defendants
had
admitted
liability.
secondly,
and
more
importantly,
we
were
in
the--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--they
didn't
have
enough
money.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
cost
money.
this
man
had
only
1,000
shares.
the
second...
and
very
few
securities
litigants
would
be
in
a
position
who
opted
out.
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
the
chief
justice
made
in
shutts
about
the
desirability
of
class
actions
when
you
need
people
with
very--
the
second
point,
and
more
important
point
is,
we
couldn't
opt
out
the
class,
the
federal
class.
we
were
in
the
position
of
being
fiduciaries.
in
the
federal
proceeding,
vindicating
a
federal
claim,
there
are
500
docket
entries
in
that
case.
contrary
to
what
was
suggested
here,
there
were
no
litigation
entries
in
that...
in
the
delaware
case
for
a
period
of
18
months.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
three
hundred
in
the
ninth...
300
in
the...
300...
there
are
a
total
of
500
docket
entries,
300
from
the
point
at
which
the
delaware
settlement
was
rejected
by
the
chancellor
in
our
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
prior
to
the
district
court,
yes.
the--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--well,
the...
in
case
i
don't
get
enough
time,
the
best
treatment
of
that
topic
is
in
restatement
of
judgments,
which
is
prepared
by
delaware's...
the
reporter
of
which
is
their
counsel.
the...
there
are
various
kinds
of
representative
suits,
and
they're
all
described
in
section
7...
in
section
41
of
the
restatement
of
judgment,
seconds.
there
are
some
representative
suits
that
exist
by
virtue
of
an
independent
relationship.
if
i
were
a
trustee
for
you,
i
would
have
general
authority
to
act
for
you
and
litigate.
some
other
kinds
of
representatives
are
appointed
by
law.
the
guardian
ad
litem
is
one
situation.
the--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--the
class
representative
is
another,
and
it's
a...
they
all
have
their
unique
history.
they
all
have
their
unique
dangers.
they
all...
no
representative
can
bind
on
the
basis
of
inadequate
representation.
that's
clear
law.
but
in
the
history
of
the
class
action
case,
the
class
representative
would
pose
severe
problems,
because
the
class
representative
is...
the
guardian
gets
a
general
commission
when
he's
appointed,
take
care
of
this
person.
he
may
be
a
guardian
only
for
the
purposes
of
this
suit,
but
it's,
take
care
of
this
person,
but
he's
a
lot
closer
to
the
individual.
in
the
class
action--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--sure,
yes.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
state
agency
law--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--no,
that--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--no,
your
honor.
the...
you
initially
start
with
the
dimensions
of
the
agency
created
by
state
law--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--but
the
question
ultimately
is
what
the
state
court
could
authorize
the
representative
to
do,
and
that
representative--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--section
27
works
differently
with
respect
to
class
actions.
the
class
representative...
the
class
representative
is
organized
entirely
around
his
complaint,
state
law
claims.
a
guardian
ad
litem,
pursuing
'34
act
claims...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
state
could
not
authorize
a
guardian
ad
litem
to
bring
a
'34
act
claim
in
the
state
court,
couldn't
authorize
that,
and
therefore
it
can't
authorize
him
to
do
it
in
the
federal
court...
i
mean,
in
the
state
court...
in...
in...
it
can't
authorize
him
to
bring
it
in
in
the
state
court
and
it
can't
authorize
him
to
settle
it,
in
our
point
of
view.
that's
inconsistent
with
section
27.
what's
happening
here
is--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--the
guardian
could
not
settle
the
claim
in
the
state
court,
no.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
if
they
did
that,
and
they
wanted
to
make
it
effective,
they
would
have
to
go
into
the
federal
court
to
get
the
federal
court's
approval,
subject,
of
course,
your
honor--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--to
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
operates
here
to
eliminate
a
lot
of
these
problems.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
by
an
individual...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
a
general
release
by
an
individual
is
fine.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the...
by
a
guardian
ad
litem,
yes.
general
release--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--the
guardian
couldn't
release
the
federal
claim.
the
guardian
ad
litem
could
not
release
the
federal
claim...
well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--about
that,
your
honor.
that's
a
very
hard
question.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it's
an
individual,
and
an
individual,
it's
a
difficult
question,
yes.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
the
guardian...
bear
in
mind
that
you
could
not
appoint
a...
new
york...
delaware
could
not
appoint
a
guardian
to
act
in
new
york
for
us.
the
question
is,
what
can
be
lawfully...
what
can
the
state
lawfully
confer
upon
somebody
who
is...
whose
authority
is
constituted
by
law?
my
basic
position
is
they
cannot
authorize
these
persons
to
litigate
cases
in
the
federal
court.
that's
not
challenged.
there's
no
suggestion
they
can
litigate.
what
you
can't
litigate--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--in
the
state
court,
i'm
sorry.
thank
you,
your
honor...
you
can't...
you
cannot
also
release
in
the
state
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that
covers
the
guardian,
yes.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit's
view
of
the
matter
was,
and
it's
a
perfectly
defensible
view,
was
that
the
state
court
can
release
parallel
or
mirror
image
claims
but
not...
and
we
certainly
are
not
abandoning
that
position.
the
ninth
circuit's
view
has
this
advantage,
your
honor.
it
results
in
the
federal
claim
not
being
systematically
undervalued,
because
if
you
can't...
if
the
state
guardian
can't
affect
a
securities
act
claim
in
any
way,
he
can't
protect
it,
because
he
can't
fight.
in
the
overlap
cases,
the
mirror
image
cases
where
the
state
law
and
the
state
law
are
sort
of
a
mirror
image
of
one
another,
you
could
make
the
argument
that
the
state
representative,
in
settling,
has
got
enough
muscle
to
protect
the
underlying
federal
claim.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
you
have
to
understand
the
reality
of
this,
because...
i
know
your
honor
is
not
disposed
to
the
question
of
adequate
representation,
and
i'm
not
going
to
press
it.
i
just
want
to
say
one
thing
about
it,
if
you'll
permit.
if
you
will...
if
you
think
it's
before
you,
and
i
think
it's
before
you,
if
you
will
look,
the
state
judge
made
no
inquiry
into
adequacy
representation.
there
wasn't...
in
the
record,
you
will
find
the
word
adequate
representation
mentioned
once
in
the
judgment,
no
inquiry
at
all,
because
he
didn't
think
it
was
relevant,
and
the
reason
he
didn't
think
it
was
relevant,
because
he
was
the
judge
in
the
prezant
case.
the
vice
chancellor
in
this
case
thought
that
there
was
only
one
issue
is
this
a
good
settlement?
if
you
look
at
his
initial
opinion,
if
you
look
at
his
subsequent
opinion,
if
you
look
at
the
order
of
notice
scheduling
a
hearing,
there
is
no
mention
that
there
will
be
a
challenge
to
the
adequacy
of
representation.
he's
the
vice
chancellor
who
was
reversed
in
the
prezant
case
because
he
didn't
think
it
was
relevant.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
had
we
gone
into
delaware,
our
judgment
was
we
could
not
adequately
protect
the
class.
if
we...
for
a
number
of
reasons
which
i'll
go
into.
if
we
stayed
out,
relying
on
the
restatement
of
judgments,
among
other
things,
we
knew
that
we
could
make
collaterally
the
attack
on
lack
of
adequate
representation,
due
process,
and...
this
addresses
a
point
that
may
be
of
particular
interest
to
justice
o'connor...
there
would
be
no
marrese
problem
because,
on
page
26
of
our
brief,
we
point
out
that
the
delaware
court
would
permit
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
attack.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--yes,
from
his
first
opinion.
his
first
opinion--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--nothing--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--nothing,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
risk
that
we
would
have
undertaken
had
we
gone
into
the
delaware
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
of
section
27
of
the--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--well,
section
27
is
not
the
williams
act.
section
27--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--right.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
there
is
no
difference
between...
in
terms
of
the
act
between
adjudicating
the
claim
and
releasing
it.
section
27
doesn't
make
that
distinction.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
mm
hmm.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
he
can...
if
he's
appointed
by
the
court,
he
could
release
the
claim
as
a
matter
of
contract.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
he's
appointed
by
a
state
court,
he
releases
as
a
matter
of
contract
law.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
he
can
release
as
a
matter...
individuals
can
release
as
a
matter
of
contract
law.
now,
if
he's
appointed
as
a
guardian
for
purposes
of
litigation,
he
can't
litigate
it,
but
if
i
was
appointed
your
guardian,
justice
scalia,
i
could
release
all
your
federal
claims.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
but
i
would
submit,
your
honor...
and
i
respect
your
predisposition,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
question
of
adequacy
is
before
the
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no
further
questions...
thank
you.
