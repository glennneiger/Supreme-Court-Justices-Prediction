justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
know
that...
how
could
you
count
on
the
fact
that
you'd
collaterally
attack
the
adequacy
of
the
representation?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
know
in
advance
that
this
vice
chancellor
would
not
inquire
into
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
pretty
high
risk--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
guess
that
he
would
not
inquire
into
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
monaghan,
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
suppose
somebody
who's
incompetent
has
a
federal
claim
against
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
i
get
that
federal
claim
released?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
appointed
by
a
state
court...
by
a
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
he
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
state
court
considered
that
point--
--yes,
i
don't
think--
--and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
wasn't
incompatible,
and
therefore
we're
going
to
render
this
judgment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--fully
litigated,
and
a
state
court
came
to
that
conclusion.
