chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-1809,
matsushita
electric
industrial
company
v.
lawrence
epstein.
mr.
ostrager,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ostrager,
on
what
authority
do
you
base
your
statement
to
justice
ginsburg
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
class
members
to
prove
the
adequacy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
either
of
those
cases
talk
about
the
burden
of
proof?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
shutts
says
that.
did
the
ninth
circuit
deal
with
these
questions
at
all
about
adequacy
of
representation
or
due
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ostrager.
mr.
monaghan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
monaghan,
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
a
federal
court
can
withhold
full
faith
and
credit
from
a
state
court
final
judgment
approving
a
class
action
settlement
simply
because
the
settlement
included
a
release
of
exclusively
federal
claims.
respondents
phrase
the
question,
did
the
court
below
err
in
refusing
to
give
preclusive
effect
to
a
delaware
settlement
and
release
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
claims
were
factually
and
legally
unrelated
to
any
state
law
claims.
no
question
of
due
process
or
adequacy
is
raised
in
the
petition.
you
didn't
cross
petition.
this
would
be
a
totally
alternate
ground
for
affirmance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
certainly
isn't
the
question...
it's
a
much
narrower
question
presented
by
the
petition,
whether
the
state
court
can
release
federal
claims
as
well
as
state
claims.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
wasn't...
the
ninth
circuit...
the
ninth
circuit
said
they
couldn't
do
it
simply
because
state
courts
didn't
have
that
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
i
think,
fairly
understood,
that
was
the
question
presented
on
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page
is
it
on,
mr.
monaghan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
500
entries,
that's
in
the
ninth
circuit,
what
became
the
ninth
circuit
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
have
been
the
district
court
of
california.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
what
if
the
state
court
action
is
brought
and
there
are...
in
the
state
by
this
guardian,
and
there
are
federal
claims
but
there
are
state
claims
as
well,
and
district
court,
or
the
state
superior
court,
whatever,
says
i
can
only
deal
with
the
state
law
claims.
the
others,
i
agree
with
mr.
monaghan,
i
don't
have
jurisdiction.
and
then
the
parties
reach
a
settlement,
and
they
want
to
settle
not
only
the
state
law
claims
but
the
federal
claims,
execute
general
releases,
just
like
so
many
people.
they
can
do
that,
i
take
it,
can't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
been
no--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--by
individuals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
by
a
guardian
ad
litem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
an
easy
assignment.
yes.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
quite
right,
the
respondent
can
urge
affirmance
on
alternate
grounds,
but
we
rarely
do
it.
we
generally
want
to
decide
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
monaghan.
mr.
ostrager,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
could
have
been
collaterally
attacked.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
if
you
litigate
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court,
the
state
court
decides
against
you,
you
lose
on
the
sunshine
v.
treinies,
and
some
of
those
cases
in
the
early
forties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ostrager.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
