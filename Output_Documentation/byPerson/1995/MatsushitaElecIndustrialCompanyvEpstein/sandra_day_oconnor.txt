is
there
any
case
authority
for
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
adequacy
of
representation?
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
decide
that
question?
i
cannot
cite
the
court
to
a
specific
case
on
that
issue.
can
i
ask
you
a
slightly...
the
delaware
court
finds
that
the
representation
is
adequate,
let's
say
that's
affirmed
on
appeal
in
delaware,
and
that
notice
was
adequate,
and
all
the
constitutional
requisites
are
complied
with.
then
is
that
finding
itself
binding
upon
a
later
federal
court
for
full
faith
and
credit
purposes,
or
can
a
person
who
believes
to
the
contrary
come
into
federal
court
and
ask
them
to
relitigate
that
on
the
ground
that
they
weren't
fair.
i,
says
this
person
who's
never
been
heard
of
before,
you
see,
never
have
been
to
delaware,
know
nothing
about
this,
don't
read
my
mail,
and
i
would
like
to
now
litigate
in
federal
court
whether
that
was
a
constitutionally
adequate
protection
of
my
rights
because
i
wasn't
even
in
delaware
and
the
representation
was
so
terrible
that,
of
course,
it
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution
to
take
property
from
me.
how
does
that
work?
is
me
now,
the
imaginary
me,
bound
by
this
finding
as
to
the
constitutional
due
process
adequacy
of
the
representation
in
delaware
by
the
decision
of
the
delaware
court,
or
can
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
federal
circuit
relitigate
all
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
monaghan,
i
think
you're
at
some
risk
here
today
if
you
are
unwilling
to
even
argue
the
question
on
which
cert
was
granted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
question
that
i
intend
to
deal
with
when
i
get
to
work
on
the
case,
and
i
would
assume
you'd
want
to
deal
with
it
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
not
go
off
on
some
peripheral
issues
that
aren't
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
quite
amazed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
take
the
view
that
if
it
were
an
individual
lawsuit
in
state
court,
and
there
is
a
settlement
in
state
court
and
a
judgment
that
disposes
of
a
release
of
any
federal
claim
as
well,
that
the
federal
court
later
would
give
full
faith
and
credit--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
that
judgment,
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
would
not
follow
that
rule
or
practice
if
it's
a
class
action,
and
i
thought
we
were
here
to
determine
whether
that
is
correct
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
state
law
authorize
as
a
principle
of
agency
someone
to
represent
an
individual
and
do
this
in
an
individual
suit
by
virtue
of
state
agency
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
so
why
can't
it
be
done
in
the
class
action
context
under
state
law,
and
why
isn't
the
remedy
of
those
who
object,
such
as
your
clients,
simply
opting
out?
why
don't
they
opt
out
if
they
don't
like
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so--
--that
wasn't
the
ninth
circuit's
view
of
the
matter,
though,
was
it?
