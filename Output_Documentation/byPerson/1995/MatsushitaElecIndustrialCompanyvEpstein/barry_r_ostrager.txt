mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
should
have
given
a
final
judgment
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
the
same
effect
it
would
have
been
given
in
delaware.
the
delaware
judgment
approved
a
class
action
settlement
and
incorporated
a
release
of
all
claims
arising
out
of
the
transaction
at
issue,
including
exclusively
federal
claims.
this
court's
decision
in
marrese
teaches
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
applies
to
all
state
court
judgments,
including
state
court
judgments
which
have
a
preclusive
effect
on
exclusively
federal
claims.
thus,
we
believe
that
section
1738
requires
that
a
state
court
judgment
incorporating
a
consensual
release
of
exclusively
federal
claims
must
be
given
full
faith
and
credit.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
does
not
cite
marrese
at
all,
and
ignores
this
court's
full
faith
and
credit
jurisprudence
as
reflected
in
this
court's
decisions
in
allen,
kremer,
migra,
and
parsons
steel.
these
cases
all
teach
that
if
a
state
court
judgment
bars
subsequent
litigation
under
the
law
of
the
rendering
court,
that
a
federal
court
must
grant
full
faith
and
credit
to
that
judgment--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--yes,
your
honor,
and
in
addition
the
marrese
test
indicates
that
full
faith
and
credit
must
be
granted
unless
there
is
an
express
or
implied
repeal
by
the
after
enacted
statute.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
the
delaware
rule
23
procedure,
which
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
federal
rule
23
procedure,
constituted
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
for
the
absent
class
members
to
contest
the
process
which
bound
the
class,
and
notice
was
sent
to
all
class
members
which
contained
the
outcome
of
the
case.
class
members
were
told
that
a
settlement
had
been
reached
and
precisely
what
the
class
members
were
receiving
and
what
they
were
giving
up.
each
class
member
had
the
right
to
opt
out.
each
class
member
had
the
right
to
appear
and
object.
this
court
held
in
the
shutts
case
that
failure
to
opt
out
constitutes
consent
to
the
jurisdiction--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--of
the
class
action.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
objectors
appeared
and
were
heard.
the
objectors
had
the
opportunity
to
conduct
discovery
concerning
the
decision
making
process
of
the
class
representatives.
that
appears
in
the
record
at
joint
appendix
cites
255
and
256.
the
objectors
specifically
raised
the
issue
of
the
adequacy
of
representation.
the
objectors
contended
that
there
was
something
collusive
about
the
delaware
settlement.
that
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
242
to
244.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--there
was
a
hearing
before
the
delaware
chancery
court.
the
objectors
raised
their
arguments
that
there
was
inadequate
representation.
they
raised
arguments--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--in
this
case,
the
class
in
delaware
was
represented
by
12
class
representatives--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--named
class
representatives,
and
they
were
represented
by
20
sets
of
lawyers.
four
sets
of
the
lawyers
were
named
as
co
lead
counsel,
and
16
sets
of
lawyers
were
named
as
part
of
a
committee
of
the
whole.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
if
this
settlement
had
been
presented
to
the
federal
court,
which
had
dismissed
the
federal
claims,
and
the
state
of
the
record
was
the
same
record
which
was
considered
by
the
delaware
chancery
court
and
the
court
was
looking
at
the
settlement
ex
ante,
and
looking
at
the
settlement
at
the
time
it
was
entered
into,
the
same
result
would
have
been
reached.
our
position
is
that
the
delaware
chancery
court
and
all
state
courts
are
equally
capable,
as
federal
courts
are,
in
considering
the
fairness
and
adequacy
of
the
settlement.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
we
believe
that
it
is
for
the
court
before
whom
the
case
is
pending,
consistent
with
rule
23
procedure,
to
make
a
determination
concerning
the
adequacy
of
representation.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
believe
it
would
be
the
class
representatives,
and
i
believe
it
important
to
know
that
in
this
case,
in
which
the
adequacy
of
representation
was
actually
litigated,
the
respondents
in
this
case
were
not
the
type
of
sideline
sitters
who
were
referred
to
by
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
in
martin
v.
wilks.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
yes.
this
was
challenged
on
appeal,
and
i
think
it--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--the
objectors
appealed.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
the
objectors
in
this
case
were
a
mr.
krupman
and
two
relatives
of
mr.
minton,
and
significantly,
and
this
goes
to
the
point
i
made
about
sideline
sitters,
significantly
the
respondents
in
this
case
prepared
a
draft
objection
which
was
utilized
by
the
objectors
in
the
delaware
fairness
hearing.
that
appears
in
the
record
at
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
250
to
251.
so
we
have
a
situation
where
there
was
full
litigation
on
the
issue
of
adequacy
of
representation.
many
of
the
due
process
issues
that
are
asserted
here
but
which
were
not
considered
by
the
ninth
circuit
at
all
in
its
opinion,
were
raised
in
the
delaware
chancery
court.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
the--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--the
representatives
presented
to
the
delaware
chancery
court
a
full
record
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
that
preceded
the
settlement.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
the
hearing
before
the
chancery
court
appears
beginning
at
page
222
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
what
is
relevant
to
the
adequacy
of
the
representation
is
that
these
class
members
were
represented
by--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--the
full
record
includes
the
submissions
by
the
class
representatives
of
all
the
proceedings
in
the
court,
and
among
the
places
where
these
are
found
are
at
the
joint
appendix
at
269,
270,
271,
and
those
pages
reference
exhibits
that
were
included
in
the
submissions
to
the
delaware
chancery
court
which
reflected
the
entire
history
of
the
litigation
before
the
delaware
chancery
court
and
the
entire
history
of
the
litigation
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
believe
that--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
believe
that
the
issue
of
suspicions
abounding
was
raised.
these
types
of
suspicions
unfortunately
exist
in
every
class
action.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
your
honor,
i
believe
that
what
the
delaware
chancery
court
found
was
that
the
representatives
were
adequate,
and
that
the
settlement
was
fair
and
reasonable,
and
that
the
suggestions--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--that
there
was
something
inappropriate
about
the
representations
were
not--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--established--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
don't
believe
that
to
be
the
case,
your
honor.
i
believe
that--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
believe
that
his
conclusion
was
that
the
representatives
were
adequate
and
had
fairly
represented
the
class,
and
that
any
suggestion
to
the
contrary
was
unfounded.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
well,
i
believe
that
the
concept
of
representative
action
is
such
that
the
court
must
make
a
finding
in
order
to
bind
class
members
that
representation
is
adequate.
that
is
implicit
in
both
the
shutts
case
and
the
eisen
case.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
don't
believe
they
explicitly
referenced
the
burden
of
proof.
i
believe
in
this
case
we
can
meet
that
burden
of
proof
and
have
demonstrated
that
this
issue
was
fully
and
fairly
litigated
before
the
delaware
chancery
court,
and
as
to
that
issue,
there
should
be
issue
preclusion.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
believe
this
court
answered
that
precise
question
head
on
in
the
shutts
case.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
in
shutts
the
court,
discussing
an
opt
out
settlement...
and
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
an
opt
out
settlement.
any
class
member
who
wanted
to
pursue
a
federal
claim
in
a
federal
forum
could
have
merely
by
executing
the
opt
out
form,
and
in
the
shutts
case--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--under
mullane
and
under
eisen
the
notice
that
should
go
out
has
to
be
the
best
notice
practicable.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
believe...
i
believe
that
you
are
bound.
i
believe
in
this
case
the
adequacy
of
notice
is
another
issue
that
was
specifically
litigated--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--in
the
delaware
court.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
yes,
and
the
shutts
case
says
that
it
is
the
rare
absent
class
member
whose
claim
is
so
important
that
he
shouldn't
be
bound
if
he
doesn't
execute
an
opt
out
opportunity.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
believe
if
the...
if
the
best
notice
practicable
was
used,
then
that
is
sufficient
to
bind
absent
class
members.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
believe
that...
even
though--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
other
than
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
we
are
aware
of
no
decision
in
the
federal
system
which
holds
that
a
court
cannot
resolve
consensually--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--there
shouldn't
be
such
a
decision
because
in
a
long
line
of
cases
this
court
has
recognized
the
importance
of
finality
in
transactions
and
litigations.
if
i
may
for
one
moment
talk--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--we
have
accepted
that
burden,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
the
prezant
case
held
specifically,
i
believe,
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
reviewing
court
to
make
a
finding
of
adequacy
of
representation,
and
i
don't
mean
to
quibble
with
your
honor.
we
are
accepting
the
burden
of
proving
that
representation
was
adequate,
and
we
believe
it
was
met
in
this
case.
and
if
i
could
come
back
a
moment
to
the
practical
aspects
of
allowing
the
ninth
circuit
decision
to
stand,
if
a
finding
that
a
class
action
settlement
is
fair
and
is...
and
one
which
is
entered
with
all
due
process
can
be
the
subject
of
collateral
attack,
it
eliminates
all
finality
with
respect
to
the
scores
of
other
cases
which
are...
have
been
concluded
in
the
state
court
system
and
which
involve
a
germ
of
a
federal
claim.
it
effectively
forces
all
actions
into
federal
court,
because
it's
impractical
for
any
litigant
to
settle
any
case
unless
all
claims
arising
out
of
a
particular
transaction,
actual
or
potential,
state
or
federal,
are
concluded.
it
allows
class
members
to
completely
bypass
the
ordinary
and
regular
state
court
class
action
procedures.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
certainly,
if
anything
that
occurred
in
delaware
was
violative
of
any
federal
right,
review
would
be
available
on
certiorari
after
review
in
the
delaware
supreme
court,
and--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
believe
that
federal
issues
that
are
decided
in
a
state
court
are
properly
reviewable
on
direct
appeal
to
this
court
pursuant
to
1257
rather
than
collateral
attack.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
believe
that
in
this
case,
where
the
settlement
court
was
looking
at
a
situation
where
the
federal
claims
had
previously
been
dismissed
and
was
making
an
assessment
of
whether
a
settlement
that
was
available
to
a
class
then
and
at
that
point
in
time
is
certainly
something
within
the
discretion
of
the
state
courts
to
resolve.
i
might
point
out
that--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
do
not.
i
do
not.
i
do
not
believe
that
any
issue
that
arises
in
the
context
of
a
settlement
impacts
on
federal
concerns.
there's
no
impact
on
the
uniform
enforcement
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
in
this
case,
the
opt
out
right
assured
the
respondents
of
the
right
to
pursue
the
federal
claims
if
they
so
chose.
the
right
to
object
enabled
them...
which
was
availed,
enabled
them
to
raise
any
federal
constitutional
issues
in
this
court
on
direct
review.
the
sec
could
have
reviewed
any
federal
issues
of
consequence
which
arose
out
of
this
transaction
wholly
apart
from
the
disposition
of
this
case
by
settlement.
indeed,
in
this
case,
the
only
federal
interest
that
was
implicated
by
the
settlement
is
the
affirmative
federal
interest
in
ensuring
efficiency
of
settlements.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
think
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
proverbial
fluid
situation.
there
was
a
state
claim
asserted.
the
state
claim
certainly
stated
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
the
state
claim
had
issues
in
it
which,
if
litigated--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--the
class
representatives
in
this
case
most
assuredly
continued
to
monitor
developments
not
only
in
the
state
case
but
in
the
federal
case
as
well,
and
there
was
ongoing
discovery
to
which
these
class
representatives
had
access,
and
they--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
don't
believe
that
the
only
viable
issue
was
a
federal
issue,
and
i
might
point
out
that
matsushita
didn't
initiate
an
action
in
the
delaware
chancery
court.
matsushita
was
sued
by
12
people
represented
by
20
law
firms
in
delaware,
and
dealt
with
that
case
as
it
defended
the
federal
case.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
it
was
judgment
of
counsel
that
the
delaware
claim
stated
a
claim
upon
which
could
be
granted.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
with
respect
to
the
supremacy
clause
argument
advanced
by
respondents,
we
submit
that
the
respondents
have
made
a
fatal
concession
to
that
argument
in
footnote
26
of
their
brief,
in
which
respondents
concede
that
individuals
can
release
federal
claims
in
a
state
court
proceeding,
and
a
derivative
action
in
a
state
court
can
release
federal
claims.
that
same
concession
is
made
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
opinion,
and
that
appears
in
the
petitioner's
appendix
at
page
38
and
footnote
32.
manifestly,
if
federal
claims
can
be
dismissed
in
the
context
of
an
individual
action
or
in
a
derivative
action,
then
there's
no
federal
supremacy
issue
here,
and
there's
also
no
federal
preemption
issue
here.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
delaware
law
has
the
equivalent
of
federal
rule
60,
and
so
there
could
be
such
an
application
made.
i'd
like,
if
i
could,
to
address
myself
briefly
to
the
issue
of
the
implied
or
express
repeal
of
1738.
this
court
held
in
shearson
v.
mcmahon
that
parties
could
contractually
agree
to
have
federal
securities
laws
arbitrated.
in
the
mitsubishi
case,
this
court
held
that
federal
antitrust
claims
could
be
arbitrated.
since
the
becher
case
in
1929,
when
justice
holmes
wrote
that
there
can
be
issue
preclusion
that
will
terminate
a
federal
patent
case
on
the
basis
of
findings
in
a
state
court,
it
can't
seriously
be
contended
that
what
occurs
in
lawfully
constituted
state
proceedings
cannot
impact
and,
indeed,
determine
federal
proceedings.
in
allen
v.
mccurry,
this
court,
in
terms
of
interpreting
section
1738,
held
"congress
has
specifically
required
all
federal
courts
to
give
preclusive
effect
to
state
court
judgments
whenever
the
courts
of
a
state--
"
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--if
there
had
been
an
adjudication--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--of
federal
claims,
that
would
violate
the
supremacy
clause.
then
there
would
be
a
manifest
incompatibility
with
section
1738,
but
in
the
context
of
a
consensual
settlement--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
believe
that
in
that--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--in
that
case,
review
would
be
available
