justice
david
h.
souter
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
delaware
supreme
court.
was
the
adequacy
of
representation
one
of
the
grounds
for
appeal,
because
i...
the
judgment
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
is
simply
of
straight
out
affirmance.
it
doesn't
indicate
what
issues
were
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
it
after
that
record
had
been
assembled
and
reviewed
at
the
trial
level
that
the
trial
judge
made
the
remark
that
there
was
perhaps
a
whiff
of
collusion
but
that
was
not
proof
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
he
had
seen
all
of
that,
and
he
seemed
to
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
other
side.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
express
a
suspicion.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
guess
my
point
is,
he
both
expressed
suspicion
and,
if
i
understand
his
remark
correctly,
assumed
that
the
burden
of
proving
inadequate
representation
was
on
those
who
objected
to
it,
isn't
that...
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
--help
me
out.
i
don't
want
to
put--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth,
but
as
i
recall
his
remark,
which
i
don't...
his
statement,
which
i
don't
have
in
front
of
me,
he
said
there
was
something,
a
whiff
or
suspicion
or
what
not,
of
collusion,
and
then
he
went
on
to
say,
as
i
recall,
that
that,
however,
is
not
enough.
that
does
not
prove
that
it
occurred.
and
doesn't
that
further
statement
suggest
that
he
thought
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue
of
adequacy
was
upon
those
who
objected,
not
upon
the
class
representatives?
justice
david
h.
souter
am
i...
tell
me
where
i'm
wrong
on
my
factual
assumptions.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
i
suppose
ultimately
the
justification
for
the
conclusion
that
you
press
on
him
is
that
somehow
there's
got
to
be
a
way
of
managing
class
actions,
and
once
in
a
while
somebody's
going
to
get
hurt,
possibly,
but
not
hurt
very
much,
and
that's
simply
a
price
that
we've
got
to
pay.
one,
i
guess,
objection
to
that
line
of
argument
is,
is
the
argument
that
in
fact
when
state
courts
are
dealing
with
settlements
of
class
actions
which
purport
to
cover
exclusively
federal
claims,
they
have
no
legal
authority
to
authorize
class
representatives
to
make
these
ostensibly
binding
agreements
with
respect
to
the
federal
claims
at
all.
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
why
shouldn't
there
be
such
a
decision?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
the
answer
to
this,
if
there
is
an
answer,
that
that
is
what
the
courts
of
delaware,
at
least,
understand
delaware
state
law
to
be?
why
is
delaware...
why
is
it
constitutionally
impossible
for
delaware
state
law
to
grant
this
authority
subject
always
to
a
due
process
attack?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
there
were
a
federal
statute
that
expressly
provided
that
no
state
court
or
no
state
law
system
could
authorize
class
representatives
to
make
this
kind
of
an
agreement
in
a
way
that
would
be
binding
in
the
federal
court,
i
would
see
the
argument,
but
federal
law
seems
to
be
silent
on
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what's
the
inconsistency
there
with
a
state
law
saying,
you
are
authorized
to
settle
these
federal
claims?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
suppose
in
this
hypothetical
the
contract
says,
this
contract
shall
be
enforceable
only
if
it
is
entered
into
a
judgment
in
the
federal
court...
in
the
state
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
let
me
ask
you
this
question
just
to
modify
the
example.
let's
assume
you're
right
so
far
as
the
inadequacy
of
state
law
to
in
effect
to
effect
the
result
that
justice
breyer
is
talking
about,
is
there
any
bar
to
a
rule
of
federal
common
law
in
courts
that
do
have
exclusive
jurisdictions...
jurisdiction
over
these
matters
that
says,
we
will
in
fact
recognize
state
court
judgments
which
purport
to
do
this,
subject
always
to
collateral
attack
for
due
process,
so
that
now
we're
depending
not
on
the
efficacy
of
state
law
and
the
full
faith
statute,
we're
adding
an
element
of
federal
common
law
that
says,
it's
okay
so
long
as
we
can
look
into
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
bar
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
he...
he
made
the
federal
common
law
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
a
question--
--i
still
don't
understand.
it
seems
to
me
that
based
on
your
answers
to
me
and
to
justice
breyer
that
it
would
be,
if
you
prevail
on
this
case,
quite
an
abuse
of
authority
and
an
exercise
of
authority
in
excess
of
jurisdiction
for
a
state
court
ever
to
approve
a
release
of
a
patent
claim,
of
an
antitrust
claim,
of
any
claim
where
there
is
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction,
even
in
a
private
action
with
a
private
contractor.
i
don't
see
how
the
class
action
is
any
different--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
private
individual
puts
in
the
contract
that
the
contract
is
conditional
upon
approval
and
incorporation
into
a
state
court
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
can't...
an
individual
can't
confer
jurisdiction
on
a
court
that
it
doesn't
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
a
court
can
recognize
a
contract
but
it
cannot
provide
authority
to
a
third
party
to
make
a
contract.
that's
where
you're
drawing
the
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
monaghan,
why
can
a
state
court
authorize
a
guardian
to
settle
an
individual
claim
arising
under
exclusively
under
federal
action
but
not
a
class?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
class
representative
is
another.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
apologize
for
this,
but
may
i
interrupt
you
on
this?
i
take
it
the
answer
to
my
question
is
not
an
answer
that
depends
on
federal
law,
it
is
an
answer
which
depends
on
a
kind
of
a
state
agency
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
exclusiveness
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
underlying
action
has
nothing
to
do
ultimately--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
the
state,
where
it
says,
we
can
authorize
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
representative
to
bind
this
class,
it's
just
like
the
guardian
ad
litem
situation.
assume
that
is
state
law.
what
is
the
bar
in
federal
law,
if
federal
law
would
recognize
it
in
the
case
of
the
guardian
but
not
in
the
case
of
the
class?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
why...
then
it
could
not
authorize
him
to
settle...
a
guardian
to
settle
either.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
your
answer
was
that
the
guardian
could
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i...
all
right,
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
guardian
can
release
the
exclusively
federal
claim.
if
that's
the
answer,
why
can
the
class
representative
not
do
the
same,
because
the
guardian's
authority
comes
from
state
law.
it
receives
some
kind
of
federal
recognition.
the
class
representative's
authority
comes
from
state
law.
why
should
it
not
receive
a
parallel
recognition?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
that
covers
the
guardian.
