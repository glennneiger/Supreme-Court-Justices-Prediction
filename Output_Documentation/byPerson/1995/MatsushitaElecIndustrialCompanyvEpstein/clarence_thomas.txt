thomas
the
first
case
i
have
to
announce
is
matsushita
electric
industrial
co.
versus
epstein,
no.
94-1809.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
several
years
ago,
petitioner
made
a
tender
offer
for
the
common
stock
of
mca,
inc.
that
tender
offer
resulted
not
only
in
petitioner’s
acquisition
of
mca
but
in
two
class
action
lawsuits
against
petitioner.
first,
a
lawsuit
based
on
state
law
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
mca
shareholder’s
in
the
delaware
court
of
chancery.
while
that
suit
was
pending,
this
case
was
brought
in
federal
district
court
in
california.
respondents
asserted
claims
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934,
claims
that
only
federal
courts
may
hear
and
decide.
while
the
federal
case
was
on
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
parties
to
the
delaware
state
suit
agreed
to
a
settlement
in
exchange
for
release
of
all
claims
including
the
federal
ones
arising
out
of
the
tender
offer.
petitioner
agreed
to
pay
the
class
$2
million.
respondents
were
members
of
both
the
state
and
federal
plaintiff
classes.
after
receiving
notice
of
the
proposed
delaware
settlement,
and
the
right
to
act
of
that
settlement,
respondent
took
no
action.
the
court
of
chancery
approved
the
settlement
and
entered
the
judgment
incorporating
its
terms.
in
the
federal
case,
pending
in
the
court
of
appeal,
the
petitioner
raises
a
delaware
judgment
as
a
defense
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
act.
that
act
requires
that
all
courts
give
a
state
court
judgment
the
same
effect
that
it
will
have
in
the
courts
of
the
state
that
entered
the
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
petitioner’s
defense.
it
held
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
did
not
apply
because
the
delaware
court
had
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
by
proving
the
relief
of
the
exclusively
federal
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
the
delaware
judgment
is
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
the
fact
that
the
delaware
suit
was
a
class
action
and
that
its
judgment
might
prevent
the
litigation
of
exclusively
federal
claim
do
not
mean
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
is
inapplicable.
we
hold
that
the
act
governs
cases
like
this
one
in
which
a
state
claim
or
a
state
court
judgment
incorporate
a
class
action
settlement
that
releases
claims
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
our
precedents
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
require
us
look
to
state
law
to
see
whether
the
judgment
would
prevent
respondents
from
bringing
claims
related
to
the
tender
offer
in
the
delaware
court
and,
if
so,
whether
there
is
an
exception
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
for
exchange
act
claims.
we
think
that
a
delaware
court
would
give
this
judgment
preclusive
effect
but
we
do
note
think
that
congress
meant
to
change
the
background
rule
of
full
faith
and
credit
when
it
gave
federal
courts
sole
jurisdiction
or
over
exchange
act
claims.
even
though
the
settlement
released
exclusively
federal
claim,
the
delaware
court
did
not
act
outside
its
jurisdiction
in
approving
the
settlement
because
the
underlying
suit
was
based
purely
on
state
law.
