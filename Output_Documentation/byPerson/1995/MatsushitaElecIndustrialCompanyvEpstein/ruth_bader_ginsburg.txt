justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
subject
to
due
process,
though,
is
that
not
right?
no
full
faith
and
credit
if
there's
been
no
due
process
in
the
rendition
of
the
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
can
you
tell
me
how
the
due
process
adequate
representation,
which
i
think
is
the
focal
point
of
this
case...
how
did
the
delaware
judgment
satisfy
the
adequacy
of
representation
essential
to
due
process
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
still
concerned--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
the
adequacy
of
the
representation,
because
you
said
in
your
brief,
i
believe,
that
that
was
actually
litigated
and
decided,
and
therefore
would
have
issue
preclusive
effect,
so
can
you
describe...
because
i
don't
quite
get
from
the
briefs
what
was
the
record
that
was
established
on
the
adequacy
of
the
representation.
i
know
there
are
these
two
boiler
plate
phrases
in
the
chancery
court's
decision,
but
what
was
behind
the
determination
that
there
was
adequate
representation
of
this
class?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
was
the
evidence...
they
made
those
charges,
and
then
was
there
any
kind
of
hearing
on
them?
what
happened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
whose
burden
is
it
to
show
adequacy
of
representation?
is
it
the
objectors'
burden
to
show
inadequate
representation?
what
was
the
showing
made
of
the
adequacy
of
this
representation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
they
named?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
with
the
problem
that
the
chancery
court
judge
initially
said,
i'm
not
even
going
to...
i'm
not
going
to
accept
this
first
settlement
because
there's
nothing
in
it
for
the
shareholders,
there's
only
something
in
it
for
the
lawyers?
wouldn't
that
create
a
special
necessity
to
show
the
adequacy
of
this
same
representation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
that
any
court,
looking
at
the
record
that
was
made
on
the
adequacy
of
representation
here,
would
conclude
on
that
record
that
the
representation
was
adequate.
you
agree
with
me,
do
you
not,
that
it
is
the
representatives'
burden
to
show
the
adequacy
and
not
the
objectors'
burden
to
show
the
inadequacy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
has
the
burden
under
rule
23?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
appealed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
are
the
objectors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
full
litigation
is
still
what
i
don't
have
a
clear
picture
of,
and
you
told
me
that
there
were
objections,
and
then
i
didn't...
i
wasn't
clear
on
how
the
representative
met
its
burden
of
showing
that,
despite
those
objections,
its
representation
was
indeed
adequate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
evidence
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
would
i
find...
if
i
wanted
to
look
for
what
evidence
the
chancery
court
considered
in
making
that
determination,
where
would
i
find
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
tell
me
everything
that's
relevant
to
the
adequacy
of
the
representation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
mean
where
do
i
find
it,
because
i
don't
want
to
detain
you
any
more,
just
so
i
can
check
on
my
own.
everything...
the
record
on
which
the
chancery
court
made
the
determination
that
the
representation
was
adequate,
the
full
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
just...
before
you
proceed
on
that
line,
we
left
one
thing
dangling,
i
think.
the
question
was,
who
has
the
burden,
and
you
suggested
to
the
chief
that
that's
not
really
clear.
as
a
matter
of
delaware
law,
to
say
nothing
of
rule
23(a)(4),
isn't
it
absolutely
clear
since
the
prezant
case
that
the
representative
has
that
burden?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't...
justice
o'connor
asked
you
for
a
case.
doesn't
that
case,
that
state
law
case,
subsequent
to
this
decision,
just
stand
out
for
making
clear
that
there
is
a
very
strong
burden
on
the
representative
to
establish
adequacy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
explain
one
thing
about
the
way
this
case
unfolded?
it
was
an
initial
determination
that
these
state
claims
were
weak
at
best,
and
that
stayed
at
every
stage.
when
the
chancery
court
said,
the
federal...
the
state
claims
are
of
little
or
no
value,
there
may
be
some
federal
claim
here,
why
did
the
class
representative
continue
in
the
state
forum
when
it
appeared
that
the
only
viable
claim
was
a
federal
claim
over
which
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
a
representative
of
a
class,
and
the
judge
has
just
told
you,
i
don't
think
these
state
claims
are
worth
anything,
maybe
there's
a
federal
claim
here,
and
that's
the
same
judge
you're
going
to
be
before.
the
state
claims
didn't
change.
they
didn't
become
any
stronger.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
something
strange,
though,
about
a
case
being
in
state
court
when
the
only
really
viable
issue
is
a
federal
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
probably
could
have
gotten
a
dismissal
if
it
asked
for
it
on
the
state
claims.
it
didn't
ask
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
apart
from
this
case,
mr.
monaghan,
though,
i
take
it
to
be
your
position...
it's
a
rather
broad
position...
that
only
a
federal
court
can
approve
a
settlement
of
a
class
action
that
releases
a
claim
over
which
the
federal
courts
would
otherwise
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
take
it
from
what
you
were
just
arguing
that
that
is
the
terminal
point
that
you're
going
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
that
would
take
all
these
class
actions
out
of
the
state
arena
and
leave
them
exclusively,
if
there's
combined
federal
and
state
claims
and
there's
securities
claims,
antitrust
claims
over
which
there's
exclusive
jurisdiction,
all
of
that
has
to
be
done
in
the
federal
courts,
not
in
the
state
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
there
were
a
state
rule
comparable
to
rule
14(d)(10),
then
under--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
you
should
have
come
into
delaware
to
make
that
objection
and
not
stayed
out
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ostrager,
your
knowledge
of
delaware...
under
your
knowledge
of
delaware
law,
if
the
members
purportedly
represented
here
wanted
to
have
this
judgment
reopened
on
the
basis
of
the
delaware
supreme
court's
full
development
in
the
prezant
case,
would
it
be
possible
to
make
an
application
to
reopen
this
judgment
under
delaware
law
on--
