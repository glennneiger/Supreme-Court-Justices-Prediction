justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
this
about
the
power
of
the
delaware
court
to
order
release
of
the
federal
claims.
suppose
the
chancery
court
said,
i
think
there's
very
little
merit
to
this
federal
claim,
and
therefore
i
am
going
to
approve
the
settlement,
i
think
this
federal
claim
is
probably
not
destined
to
succeed,
and
in
the
course
of
his
analysis,
he
makes
a
misstatement
of
federal
law.
now,
would
his
certification
be
reviewable
on
certiorari
to
this
court
on
the
grounds
that
he
made
a
mistake
of
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it
would
be
reviewable
if
he
didn't
make
an
explicit
statement
but
just
made
an
assessment
of
the
federal
claim
that
was
arguably
erroneous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
an
assessment
of
the
likelihood
of
success
of
the
federal
claim
an
issue
of
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
think
that
there
was
any
federal
issue
there
for
us
to
review,
assuming
that
there
had
been
a
certiorari
petition
brought
to
us?
