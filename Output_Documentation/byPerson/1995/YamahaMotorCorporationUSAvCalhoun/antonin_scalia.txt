justice

i'm
not
sure
what
you're
saying,
mr.
morrison.
do
you
care
whether
it's
maritime
jurisdiction
or
diversity
jurisdiction?
i
mean,
you
don't
really
care,
do
you?
you
say
we
simply
do
not
have
to
decide
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
federal
admiralty
law
doesn't
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
any
circumstances
where
it
would
make
any
difference
so
long
as
federal
maritime
law
doesn't
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
your
point,
not
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
the
opinion
speaks
that
way,
mr.
morrison.
it
seems
to
me
you
really
understate
the
thrust
of
the
opinion
toward
uniformity.
i
mean,
the
big
argument
is
really
whether
moragne
is
the
signal
of
a
new
era
of
admiralty
law
in
which,
contrary
to
what
preceded
moragne,
we're
going
to
seek
to
get
uniform...
as
your
opponent
said
in
his
presentation,
uniform
treatment
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
holding
of
moragne
could
be
limited
as
narrowly
as
you
say,
but
i
don't
think
the
language
of
moragne--
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
you
make
that
argument
in
your
brief,
and
what
it
raises
in
my
mind
is
whether
you
expect
us
to
valuate
each
case
and
decide
whether
a
uniform
admiralty
law
will
apply
or
diverse
state
law
will
apply
on
the
basis
of
who
the
particular
manufacturer
is.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can't
we
have
more
predictability
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
congress
thought
we
already
did
it
in
moragne.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--like
the
majority
of
courts
of
appeals.
maybe...
maybe
congress
agreed
with
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
well,
we've
never
felt
that
we
had
judicial
authority
to
create
statutes
of
limitations.
we've
always
looked
to
state
law
for
those,
even
in
areas
where
it's
a
federal
cause
of
action,
so
that
would
explain
that
statute
rather
readily.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean
the
congress
would
not
have
expected
us
to
adopt
a
statute
of
limitations.
but
i
want
to
get
to
another
question.
you
said
that
at
least
state
law
is
well-known,
whereas
we'd
be
making
up
new
federal
admiralty
law.
well,
i
suppose
it's
well-known
if
you
know
what
state
laws
apply.
now,
is
that
a
matter
of
federal...
i
note
that
here
you're
seeking
to
apply
pennsylvania
law
to
an
injury
that
occurred
in
puerto
rico.
now,
who
would
have
guessed
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
something
that's
easy
to
figure
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
she
may
have
other
connections
to
other
places,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
acknowledge
that
it's
up
to
the
federal
admiralty
court
to
decide
which
state
law
applies,
that
the
choice
of
law
rule
is
a
federal
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
do
you
think
that
it
has
to
be
bound
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
federal
admiralty
court
sits?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
now
it
becomes
important
whether
it's
a
diversity
case
or--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--an
admiralty
case,
huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
but
let's
assume
i
think
it's
an
admiralty
case.
i
think
it's
an
admiralty
case.
should
the
federal
law
of
admiralty
determine
choice
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
substantive.
justice
antonin
scalia
jurisdiction
is
under
admiralty.
should
not
federal
law
determine
at
least
choice
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
which
state
law
it
is
until
you
answer
the
preliminary
question.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
state
law?
i
mean,
let's
assume
he
has
a
right
to
go...
which
state
law?
i
mean,
that's
the
question,
which
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
state
in
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
what
she
means
is,
federal
substantive
law
even
when
that
consists
of
adoption
of
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
