mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
twofold.
first,
the
general
federal
maritime
death
remedy
applies
to
the
death
of
any
nonseaman
in
territorial
waters
within
admiralty
jurisdiction
and,
second,
that
remedy
may
not
be
supplemented
by
state
remedies.
let
me
begin
very
briefly
with
the
first
point.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
the
issue
is
not
before
the
court,
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
no.
i
believe
what
happened
in
moragne
was
that
the
difficulties
accommodating--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--what
decides
the--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--right.
what
decides
the
displacement
of
state
remedies
issue
is
the
settled
principle
noted
by
this
court
in
tallentire
that
state
law
may
not
apply
where
it
would
change
substantive
admiralty
law.
that
has
applied
in
the
context
of
remedies
both
where
the
remedies
were
developed
by
statute,
as
in
the
cases
of
tallentire
and
chelentis...
excuse
me,
tallentire
and
gillespie,
dealing
with
the
statutory
death
remedies
under
the
dohsa
and
the
jones
act.
it's
applied
in
the
context
of
injury
in
the
chelentis
case...
where
this
court
developed
a
substantive
maritime
law
that
said
at
the
time
that
only
maintenance
and
cure
were
recoverable
by
seamen,
and
therefore
state
remedies
were
precluded
where
they
sought
full
indemnification,
and
that
same
principle--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--yes.
i
think
tallentire
is,
well,
factually
not
on
point,
as
a
matter
of
legal
principle
on
point,
for
this
reason.
tallentire,
after
establishing
that
there
was
no
affirmative
preservation
of
state
death
remedies
on
the
high
seas
then
had
to
confront
the
issue
of
whether,
under
settled
principles
of
admiralty
law,
whether
there
was
any
room
for
a
conflicting
state
damages
remedy.
the
court
held
that
there
was
not,
and
the
court
stated
the
operative
principle...
i
believe
it's
on
pages
223,
222,
224...
that
the
state
law
cannot
change
substantive
admiralty
law.
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--well,
i
guess
that's
the
threshold
issue
i
meant
to
address,
which
is
just
what
is
the
scope
of
the
general--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
agree.
let
me
explain
why
i
believe
that
issue
is
settled.
moragne,
although
it
was
brought
here
because
of
the
specific
problems
accommodating
unseaworthiness
to
state
statutes,
issued
a
more
broad
holding.
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
overrule
the
harrisburg,
which
was
a
negligence
case,
and
the
court
throughout
moragne
made
clear
that
it
was
reluctant
to...
that
it
felt
that
the
bar
to
recovery
in
death
cases
had
been
anachronistic,
whereas
the
court
put
the
point,
barbarous,
and
so
it
wrote
that
an
action
does
lie
under
general
maritime
law
for
death
caused
by
violation
of
maritime
duties.
those
duties
include
no
negligence,
the
duty
of
due
care.
that's
in
the
kermarec
case
from
1959.
and
so
our
point
here
is
that
there
is
no
reason
the
maritime
death
remedy
should
not
apply
to
when
the
person
killed
by
maritime
tort
just
happens
to
be
a
so-called
recreational
boater.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
right.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
conceivably,
although
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
issue
would
be,
are
state
remedies
precluded
because
they
are
inconsistent
with
the
federal
maritime
remedy,
so
while
it's
possible
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
state
remedy
could
apply,
that
is
only
because
it
is
thoroughly
consistent
with
the
federal
remedy
developed
in
moragne.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
right.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
let
me
address
those
first
as
a
matter
of
precedent,
second
as
a
matter
of
policy.
with
regard
to
precedent,
the
federal
courts
in
admiralty
are
already
in
this
business.
in
a
series
of
cases,
this
court
has
held
that
state
rules
of
liability
cannot
apply
in
admiralty,
where
they
would
be
inconsistent
with
federal
standards.
i
would
cite
to
the
court
robins
dry
dock,
involving
an
inconsistent
scaffold
regulation,
pope
and
talbot,
kermarec,
the
workman
rule
which
was
discussed
in
the
chicago
case
recently,
the
messel
case...
we're
already
in
this
business,
and
there
already
is
an
admiralty
duty
to
not
commit
products
liability.
with
regard
to
the
policy
reason,
it's
the
same
reason
that
the
court
noted
in
foremost,
which
is
the
interest
in
freedom
of
navigation.
if
state
remedies
are
allowed
to
be
used
on
the
territorial
waters,
there
will
be
different
and
potentially
onerous
state
tort
law
regimes
that
will
govern
maritime
actors
as
they
go
up
and
down
the
nation's
coastlines,
as
they
go
along
the
state,
the
nation's
interstate
waterways.
now,
that,
in
turn,
could
inhibit
the
primary
conduct
of
actors,
not
just
manufacturers
of
jet
skis--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
agree
with
your
proposition.
our...
my
suggestion
is
that
there
is
a
federal
interest
in
having
uniform
remedies,
because
remedies
affect
primary
conduct.
if
a
person--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--the
interest
is
that
article
iii
has
committed
the
admiralty
jurisdiction,
which
has
been
defined
to
include
the
former,
puerto
rico,
and
not
the
latter.
article
iii
has
established
an
interest
in
maritime
uniformity
in
order
to
protect
commerce.
if
there
are
different--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--right,
and
i
think
historically
the
reason
between
the
harrisburg
and
moragne,
why
state
remedies
were
picked
up,
was
akin...
was
simply
because
there
was
a
gap
in
federal
remedial
coverage,
and
the
admiralty
does
what
it
does
when
there
is
no
federal
law
on
point,
which
is
to
borrow
state
law,
as
judge
breyer
did
in
his
first
circuit
opinion.
when
there's
no
rule
on
point,
you
can
look
to
state
law,
providing
the
admiralty
court
elects
not
to
develop
one.
our
position
is
that
this
court
in
moragne
has
developed
a
federal
remedy.
that
remedy
is
measured
by
the
remedies
available
in
dohsa
and
the
jones
act.
there's
no
reason
for
any...
for
the
disuniformities
that
would
occur
across
classes
of
plaintiffs
or
in
different
areas
of
a
territory.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
exactly.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
i
couldn't
put
it
better,
and
essentially
the
lower
federal
courts
for
25
years
have
fleshed
out
the
moragne
remedy
in
the
nonseamen
territorial
waters
context,
following
the
cues
sent
by
this
court,
for
example
in
the
miles
case.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
right.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
but
once
you...
but
you've...
you're...
the
last
thing
you
said,
justice
breyer,
i
think
answers
the
question.
in
other
words,
if
the...
if
yamaha
is
correct
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--there
is
a
federal
remedy
that
does
not
extend
to
nonpecuniary
damages,
and--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
think
the
wahlstrom
case,
to
the
extent
that
any
court
of
appeals
deals
with
this
systematically,
does...
that's
out
of
the
second
circuit...
does
address
the
issue.
i
suppose
the
point,
though,
is
that
if
the
federal
damages
remedy
in
this
quadrant
of
territorial
waters,
nonseamen,
is
to
be
calibrated
to
the
remedies
available
under
dohsa
and
the
jones
act,
because
there
would
be
no
really
good
equitable
reason.
in
that
case,
state
law
could
apply
only
insofar
as
it
is
consistent
with
the
outlines
of
that
remedy,
which
the
lower
courts
have
generally
believed
not
to
include
nonpecuniary
damages
and
punitive
damages.
we're
certainly
not
saying
as
a
formal
matter
there's
no
reason
state
law
can't
apply
in
the
abstract,
and
state
recreational
boating
statutes
can
apply
because,
by
and
large,
they
are
not
inconsistent--
