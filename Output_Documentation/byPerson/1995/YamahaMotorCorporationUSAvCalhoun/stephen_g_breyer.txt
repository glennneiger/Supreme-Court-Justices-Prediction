justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question...
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes,
frankly,
whether
conceptually
you
say
state
law
has
its
cause
of
action
and
applies,
or
whether
you
say,
this
is
a
maritime
tort,
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
which
is
given
to
an
admiralty
court,
saving
to
suitors,
but
that's
a
remedial
and
not
a
positive
question.
but
so...
for
we
have
an
admiralty
tort
under
federal
law,
but
by
the
way,
we'll
borrow
state
law,
which,
of
course,
is
what
we
should
do,
unless
it's
hostile
to
statutes.
all
right,
so
i
don't
understand
why
it
makes
a
difference,
but
i
did
think
of
an
example
where
it
would
tell
us
it
might.
can
you,
in
a
personal
injury
action
not
leading
to
death,
under
current
law
get
punitive
damages?
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
and
i
suppose
that
what's
been
happening
in
personal
injury
cases
is
they've
been
borrowing
the
entire
state
action,
or
not
borrowing
it,
just
following
it.
but
if
the
answer's
no,
it
must
be
that
in
personal
injury
cases
what's
been
happening
is
grafting
good
state
law
onto
an
admiralty
cause
of
action,
so
what's
the
answer
to
that
question?
i
think
it's
pretty
important,
since
moragne
says
follow
personal
injury
precedent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
personal
injury
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
have
a
lot
of
cases
where
you
get--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
my
theory...
maybe
it
isn't
a
good
example,
is,
are
there
instances...
look,
you
have
millions
of
personal
injury
cases
on
territorial
waters
in
ships.
i
would
think
there
are--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--quite
a
few
involving
passengers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
what's
the
understanding
of
the
bar
in
the
states?
is
it
that
you
take
the
state
law
and
apply
it,
nothing
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
can
you
demonstrate
that
in
the
law,
because
if
you
can
demonstrate
that
in
the
law,
i
guess
that's
what
moragne
tells
us
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
do
about
the
one
precedent
against
that,
which
is
holmes
in
the
hamilton,
because
holmes
in
the
hamilton
certainly
says
that
you
can
have
a
state
statute,
pure
and
simple.
otherwise,
where
did
they
ever
get
it
in
the
state
wrongful
death
survivor
before
moragne?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
find
differences
between
the
theory
of,
what
we're
doing
is
just
borrowing
state
laws
in
an
admiralty
matter,
and
state
law
applies
pure
and
simple.
punitive
damages
doesn't
work,
but
holmes
in
the
hamilton
seems
to
apply
state
law
pure
and
simple,
doesn't
he,
because
there
was
no
federal
admiralty
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
his
theory
there?
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
choice
left.
we
may
not
know
what
it
is
yet,
but
there
is
no
choice
but
to
develop
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
want
to
know,
what
they
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
personal
injury
cases,
in
territorial
waters,
don't
admiralty
courts
by
and
large
apply
for
nonseamen,
nonlongshoremen,
state
law?
i
mean,
there
may
be
a
curlicue
that
they
lop
off,
but
that's
why
i
don't
understand
what
this
is
about,
because
the
normal
thing
would
say,
just
as
we
did
in
that
range,
or
whatever
it
is,
borrow
state
law,
unless
the
state
law
is...
what
happens
in
personal
injury
cases?
the
only
time
i
have
to
look
it
up
in
that
case,
it
looked
as
if
what
i
was
supposed
to
do
was,
here
it
is,
an
admiralty
cause
of
action,
it
doesn't
concern
a
seaman,
doesn't
concern
a
longshoreman,
so
i
should
borrow
state
law,
and
i
would
borrow
state
law
unless
it
was
inconsistent
with
some
admiralty
principle.
now,
isn't
that
what
you
should
do
even
aside
the
conceptual...
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
then
if
that's
what
you
should
do,
then
isn't...
then
here,
wouldn't
state
law
apply
across
the
board,
with
possible
exceptions
for
punitives
and
survival
of
pecuniary
damages?
that
seems
to
be
what
the
issue
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
what
judge
pollack
thought.
judge
pollack
thought
it
didn't
extend
to
survival
of
pecuniaries,
and
he
also
thought
it
didn't...
that
punitives
shouldn't
be
picked
up,
and
nobody's
really
focused
on
that
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
care
whether
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
court
were...
and
does
it,
whether
the
court
says,
of
course
maritime
law
applies,
but
in
territorial
waters,
federal
maritime
law
picks
up
state
law
insofar
as
it
is
not
hostile
to
the
policy
of
federal
maritime
law,
or
the
court
says,
of
course
state
law
applies
to
the
extent
that
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
policies
of
federal
maritime
law.
i
mean,
that's
my
basic
problem
with
this
case.
what
difference
does
it
make,
and
is
anybody
arguing
for
a
different
rule
than
either
a
or
b?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
do
you
care?
i
mean,
that
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
you
could
easily
say
that
federal
maritime
law
picks
up
in
territorial
waters.
in
fact,
the
cases
seem
consistent
with
that.
federal
maritime
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
they're
dealing...
on
the
remedy
side
they're
dealing
with
jones
act
seamen
and
longshoremen.
when
you
talk
about
passengers,
it
would
be
much
harder
to
make
a
case,
wouldn't
it,
that
remedies
of
certain
sorts...
i
mean,
maybe
the
survivor
pecuniary
is.
maybe
the
punitives
are.
i
don't
know,
but
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
happens
in
personal
injury
cases?
i'm
back
to
that
because
of
the
statement
in
moragne
which
says,
in
most
respects
the
law
applied
in
personal
injury
cases
will
answer
all
questions
that
also
arise
in
death
cases,
so
when
you
have
a
personal
injury
case
of
a
civilian
in
territorial
waters,
what
is
the
state
of
the
law,
and
i've
oddly...
perhaps
my
fault.
i
haven't
really
been
able
to
figure
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
the
reason
would
have
been
because
of
the
admiralty...
you
say,
a)
is
it
a
maritime
tort?
yes...
you're
in
admiralty
jurisdiction,
which
is
exclusive,
saving
to
suitors
their
common
law
remedies.
you
say,
and
then
we
have
the
law
which
says
remedies
just
means
the
remedial
thing.
and
then
holmes
in
the
hamilton
seems
to
the
contrary,
but
maybe
he's
just
making
state
law
part
of
admiralty
law
in
the
absence
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sure
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
they
before
picked
up
punitives?
have
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
not.
all
right,
then,
have
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
had
they
previously
awarded
future
pecuniary
damages
to
a
person
who
dies
in
a
survival
action?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
the
state
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
wondering
is,
is
if
we're
interested
in
maritime
jurisdiction
as
an
odd
historical
court
for
maritime
shipping
business,
then
from
that
perspective,
is
it
better
for
the
shipowners
and
for
the
sailors
and
the
seamen
to
have
a
generous
system
of
awards
which
would
pick
up
most
state
law
and
a
degree
of
certainty,
because
the
outliers
of
state
law
get
lopped
off.
i
mean,
looking
at
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
would
have
happened
in
all
of
this
if
your
client
had
been
injured
and
not
killed,
because
i
would
be
so
curious
to
know
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
the
petitioners
going
to
agree
with
that
last
statement?
