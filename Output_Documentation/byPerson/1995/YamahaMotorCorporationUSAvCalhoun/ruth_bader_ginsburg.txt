justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
even
though
moragne,
even
going
back
to
the
harrisburg,
said
the
way
we
got
into
this
mess
in
the
first
place
was
that
they
sued
too
late
on
the
state
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
let
me
just
understand
this
background
of
the
case.
you
have
no
quarrel
with
the
law
that
was
in
place
pre-moragne...
that
is,
for
these
inland
water
deaths.
the
remedy
was
state
survival
and
wrongful
death
acts,
pre-moragne.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
when
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
passed,
everyone
understood
that
for
inland
waters,
as
distinguished
from
overseas,
that
their
state
law
remedies
would
apply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right,
and
then
we
get
moragne,
which
involves
an
unseaworthiness
claim,
and
this
court
is
adding
something
that
didn't
exist
before,
a
federal
maritime
law
claim
for
the
unseaworthiness
for
the
benefit
of
a
longshore
worker,
and
that's
what
moragne
itself
does.
it
adds
something.
now,
you
are
saying,
but
without
saying
so,
implicit
in
moragne
is
also
a
subtraction,
and
how
do
you
get
to
the
subtraction?
i
see
what
moragne
added,
but
i
don't
see
in
the
decision
itself
anything
that
says
and,
not
only
are
we
creating
this
seaworthiness
that
the
states
don't
know
about
because
they
don't
know
about
seaworthiness
doctrine,
but
we
are
also
taking
away
what
everyone
understood
was
in
place
up
until
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bartlett,
i
think
you
conceded,
and
you
were
very
forthright
in
this,
that
pre-moragne,
the
law
that
was
applied
in
cases
like
this
was
state
law,
state
wrongful
death
acts,
state
survival
acts,
and
you
are
not
suggesting
now,
are
you,
that
that
was
an
unconstitutional
course?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bartlett,
what
federal
interest
is
disturbed
by
allowing
state
law
to
control
this
kind
of
accident?
this
is
a
complicated
case.
there's
a
very
long
opinion,
but
at
the
end
there's
a
line
that
says,
this
case
at
base
is
no
different
than
a
cause
of
action
arising
out
of
the
average
motor
vehicle
accident.
why
should
it
be
handled
differently?
is
it
a
constitutional
compulsion?
is
it
this
court's
development
of
the
maritime
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
does
that
lead
to
the
rule
that
there
must
be
absolute
uniformity?
why
can't
state
law
apply
up
until
the
point
where
there's
a
genuine
collision
with
some
authentic
federal
interest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
the
federal
interest
in
having
a
different
remedy,
a
different
regime
for
the
jet
skier
who
is
off
the
coast
of
puerto
rico
and
the
one
who
is
on
an
inland
lake.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
already...
i
think
you've
agreed
with
me
that
for
years
maritime
jurisdiction
coexisted
peacefully
with
picking
up
wrongful
death
and
survival
acts
from
state
laws
and
plugging
them
into
claims
like
this
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
morrison,
but
i'm
not
still
clear
on
this
pleader's
choice
that
the
chief
was
raising.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
pleader
could
not
type...
even
in
a
personal
injuries
civilian
claim
like
this,
that
if
you
could
bring
it
under
admiralty,
then
you
must...
then
it
does
fall
under
the
federal
maritime
jurisdiction,
that
you
could
not,
by
having
the
alternate
diversity,
come
in
as
an
ordinary
diversity
case.
i
thought
there
was
precedent
to
that
effect.
there
isn't
pleader's
choice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
let
me...
you
don't
understand
my
question.
i
want
to
make
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
simple
as
i
possibly
can.
you
plead
maritime
jurisdiction.
you
please
diversity.
i
had
thought
there
was
precedent
for...
that
the
federal
courts
must
take
this
under
the
admiralty
wing
and
do
not
have
the
discretion,
either
at
the
pleader's
request
or
as
a
matter
of
the
court's
own
choice,
which
side
of
the
court
this
is
going
to
go
on,
that
if
you
fit
within
the
admiralty
peg,
you
must
go
there
even
though
you
would
fit
under
diversity
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
morrison,
i
don't
think
that's
the
question,
because
it
is
the
same
one
that's
troubling
me,
and
let
me
put
it
this
way.
suppose
natalie
calhoun
had
been
sorely
injured
but
not
killed
in
the
same
place.
would
there
have
been
any
reference
to
state
law,
or
would
it
have
been
general
maritime
tort
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
morrison,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
moragne
would
be
a
rather
small
thing...
that
is,
if
the
personal
injury
claimant
retains
the
same
right
that
the
or
she
had
before
moragne
for
the
civilian
torts...
and
what
claim
would
moragne
apply
to
other
than
a
sailor
who
dies
and
there's
a
claim
for
unseaworthiness
which
is
not
covered
by
the
jones
act.
would...
tell
me,
if
you
are
right,
to
what
claims
does
moragne
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
mr.
morrison,
since
you
are
asking,
the
reason
you're
so
anxious
to
have
the
state
law,
bluntly,
is
it's
more
generous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
know,
if
you
shape
the
maritime
law
based
on
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
then
you
have
something
that's
even
more
predictable
than
state
common
law.
it's
a
federal
statute.
my
question
is,
why
should
the
civilian
get
a
more
generous
recovery
than
the
sailors
who
are
supposed
to
be
wards
of
the
court,
or
anybody
who
happens
to
go
down
when
the
ship
is
at
sea?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
to
be
that
way
because
we
are
making
the
law,
and
my
question
is,
why
shouldn't
the
court
be
governed
by
a
statute
that
congress
passed
to
state
that
the
recovery
for
wrongful
death
that
is
a
matter
of
court-made
law
ought
to
resemble
as
closely
as
possible
the
law
that
congress
passed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
morrison,
if
it's
like...
if
it's
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
it's
like,
say,
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
you
will
get
to
a
state
law,
but
it's
a
federal...
federal
jurisdiction,
not
diversity
jurisdiction,
you
have
a
federal
pointing
rule,
a
federal
choice
of
law
rule
that
tells
you
which
state's
law
to
apply--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
you
pick
up
the
law
of
that
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
if
we
are
into
federal
law
in
this
case,
then
by
default
this
court
must
be
the
lawmaker.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
controversy
sends
some
of
the
tragic
death
of
12
year
old
natalie
calhoun
in
the
summer
of
1989
in
a
jet
ski
accident.
on
vacation
with
family
friends
at
the
beach
park
resort
in
puerto
rico,
natalie
whose
home
state
was
pennsylvania
rented
a
jet
ski
made
by
petitioner
yamaha
motor
corporation.
while
riding
the
jet
ski,
natalie
slammed
into
a
vessel
anchored
in
waters
fronting
the
hotel
and
was
killed.
natalie’s
parents,
respondent
lucien
and
robin
calhoun
sued
yamaha
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
the
jet
ski
was
defectively
designed
or
made.
the
calhouns
sought
to
recover
damages
under
pennsylvania’s
wrongful
death
and
survival
statutes.
yamaha
argued
that
state
remedies
could
not
be
applied
because
the
death
occurred
in
navigable
waters.
in
1970,
in
moragne
against
states
marine
lines
this
court
recognized
a
federal
maritime
action
for
wrongful
death.
that
action
governed,
yamaha
contended,
to
the
exclusion
of
more
generous
remedies
available
under
state
law.
the
district
court
agreed
with
yamaha
that
state
remedies
were
unavailable
to
the
calhouns
but
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
disagreed.
we
hold
in
accord
with
the
third
circuit
that
state
wrongful
death
remedies
remain
applicable
in
cases
of
disorder
in
which
no
federal
status
specifies
the
appropriate
relief
and
the
decision
was
not
engage
in
a
maritime
trade.
traditionally,
courts
have
applied
state
remedy
in
such
cases,
the
sole
question
we
address
is
whether
the
moragne
decision
could
an
end
to
that
practice.
our
answer
is
no.
moragne
centered
on
the
extension
of
relief,
where
there
was
ones
avoid
and
not
on
a
contraction
of
remedies.
grounded
in
a
humane
and
liberal
character
of
admiralty
law,
moragne
cannot
be
read
to
displace
state
remedy
traditionally
available
to
believe
parties
like
the
calhouns.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
