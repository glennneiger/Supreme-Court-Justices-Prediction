justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
there
this
difference:
you
really
wouldn't
have
a
seaworthiness
claim
with
this
particular
article,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
what
we
had
in
moragne.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
theoretically
you
could
have
a
seaworthiness
theory
of
absolute
liability
for
passengers,
couldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case
we
have
a
negligence
theory,
don't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
contend
that
marine
preempts
the
negligence
theory,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
you
do
contend
that
a
state
law
theory,
negligence
theory
of
recovery
is
preempted.
let
me
put
is
this
way.
in
moragne
there
were
two
theories.
1)
there
was
the
florida
negligence
theory,
and
the
unseaworthiness
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
moragne
held
that
the
unseaworthiness
claim
was
available,
and
it
left
standing...
as
you
remember,
it
was
a
1292(b)
appeal...
left
standing
the
negligence
theory.
that
was
not
preempted
in
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend
that
if
the
same
two-count
complaint
were
filed
today,
that
the
negligence,
state
law
negligence
theory
would
be
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
was
not
preempted
in
moragne
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
swimmer
collides
with
water
skis...
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
your
answer?
in
this
case,
if
the
vehicle...
if
the
vessel
used
in
this
case
had
hit
another
swimmer,
and
that
swimmer
had
been
killed,
there
would
be
no
state
law
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
was
the
negligence
of
the
water
skier,
not
the
manufacturer--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
where
your
position
takes
us,
that's
what
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
you
when
you...
before
you
get
through
explain
why
the
second
count
of
moragne
survived,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
decided
in
that
case,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
moragne
didn't
decide
it,
what
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
decide
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
tallentire
decided--
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
that,
but
may
i
just
throw
in,
in
moragne
itself,
they
referred
that
question
to
the
florida
state
supreme
court,
and
they
held
there
was
no
state
remedy
for
unseaworthiness,
so
there's
an
absence
of
a
state
remedy
as
well
as
the
presence
of
a
federal
remedy
in
the
hypothetical.
