justice
david
h.
souter
because,
as
federal
common
law,
we
can
adopt
that
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
any
theory
that
is
not...
you
say
it
doesn't
preempt
a
particular
theory
of
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
answer
to
that
is
because
we
can
make
up
common
law,
federal
common
law,
and
adopt
a
different
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
just
wanted
to
understand
your
reasoning.
your
reasoning
is
that
because
state
law
is
preempted,
their
given
federal
theory
of
recovery
is
not
precluded.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
had
thought...
you're
referring
now
to
admiralty
jurisdiction.
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
please,
but
i
had
thought
that
for
many
years
admiralty
jurisdiction
has
been
a
forum
for
enforcing
any
number
of
state
rules
and
state
primary
duties.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
mixing
up
jurisdiction
here
with
the
source
of
the
primary
duty.
justice
david
h.
souter
on
your
theory,
is
there
any
role
left
for
the
enforcement
of
a
state
rule
on
a
kind
of
borrowing
theory
by
an
admiralty
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
death
of
a
swimmer?
justice
david
h.
souter
two
swimmers
collide.
justice
david
h.
souter
two
swimmers
collide,
no...
state
law
can
apply
in
that
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
what's
the
substantive
admiralty
law
here?
aren't
we
addressing
the
question
here,
assuming
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
begin
with,
should
there
in
fact
be
a
substantive
admiralty
rule
to
be
applied,
and
therefore
to
displace
state
law?
aren't
we
addressing
a
different
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
until
that
threshold
issue
is
addressed,
tallentire
isn't
on
point,
or
we
can't
tell
whether
it's
on
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
what,
in
fact,
you're
saying
is--
--well,
but
it
seems
to
me--
--i'm
sorry.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
two
choices
to
make.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
agree
with
you,
we
displace
a
substantial
body
of
state
law
on
products
liability
personal
negligence,
et
cetera,
in
all
death
cases,
areas
in
which
states
have
very
substantial
expertise,
very
well-developed
bodies
of
law.
if
we
agree
with
the
respondent,
we
displace
the
rules
of
most
of
the
circuit
courts
that
have
ruled
in
this
area,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
asking
the
federal
courts
to
begin
developing,
to
continue
to
develop
wrongful
death
rules
in
territorial
waters
where
we
don't
really
have
that
much
of
an
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you
also
make
the
more
general
point,
if
i
understood
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question,
and
that
is,
tallentire
applies
because
moragne
requires
you...
requires
the
federal
admiralty
courts
to
develop
substantive
law
in
this
area.
