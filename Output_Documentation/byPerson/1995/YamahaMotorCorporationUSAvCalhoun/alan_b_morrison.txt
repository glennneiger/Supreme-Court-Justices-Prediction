mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
historic
use
of
state
law
for
wrongful
death
accidents
that
occur
in
territorial
waters
that
has
existed
for
more
than
100
years
has
been
displaced
by
federal
maritime
law.
the
accident
here
occurred
in
territorial
waters,
not
on
the
high
seas.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
allege
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
both
on
the
diversity
statute
and
under
the
admiralty
statute.
we
believe
that
we
clearly
have
it
under
diversity.
i
would
prefer
not
to
debate
whether
we
have
it
under
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
this
court's
jurisprudence
is
quite
complicated
on
that,
and
we
think
that
one
of
the
reasons,
indeed,
that
we
should
continue
to
use
state
law
is
because
if
we
accept
the
petitioner's
position,
we
must
in
every
case...
the
first
inquiry
must
be
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
because
it's
only
if
you
have
admiralty
jurisdiction
based
on
maritime
law
that
you
get
into
this
displacement
problem
to--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
we
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
here
because
there
is
diversity,
and
we
didn't
need
to
allege
admiralty
jurisdiction,
and
we
want
to
rest
our
claim
on
the
diversity
jurisdiction
because
we
are
relying
on
substantive
state
law
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
your
honor,
that
is,
of
course,
the
court's
prerogative.
i
would
note
that
the
way
the
case
has
been
argued,
the
way
the
solicitor
general
said
may
they
continue
after
moragne--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
is...
it
has
been
argued
that
way,
but
i
would
agree
that
the
court
could
now,
as
justice
o'connor
said
earlier,
extend
moragne
to
say,
even
though
we
didn't
displace
state
law
back
then,
we're
going
to
do
it
now.
the
court
clearly
has
in
its
power
to
do
so,
and
i
want
to
first
address
the
question
of
whether
it
has
been
displaced,
and
then
to
explain
to
you
why
i
think
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
for
the
court
to
do
so.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
for
one
very
important
reason,
and
that
is
because
as
to
the
seaman,
there
is
a
federal
statute,
the
jones
act,
and
as
to
death
on
the
high
seas,
there's
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
and
for
longshoremen
or
harbor
workers
there
is
another
federal
statute,
and
so
when...
cases
like
miles
and
tallentire
and
higginbotham
all
involve
cases
where
there
was
a
comprehensive
federal
statute,
and
this
court
said
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
second
guess
the
judgment
made
by
congress.
they've
created
a
set
of
rights
with
remedies,
offsetting
benefits.
we
can't
go
beyond
that.
so
your
honor,
in
that
case,
it's
controlled
by
the
jones
act
and
its
terms,
and
you
do
not
have
an
alternative
state
remedy,
as
this
court
has
held
in
several
cases.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
i
would
also
say,
of
course,
that--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor's
question
precisely.
i
agree
that
if...
that
in
certain
situations
this
court
has
held
that
the
existence
of
federal
maritime
law
precludes
the
states
from
applying
their
substantive
law,
pope
and
talbot
and
so
forth.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
cases
in
which
the
substantive
law
to
be
applied
is
federal
maritime
law.
that
is,
that
you
cannot
get
around
the
application
of
the
substantive
law
by
pleading
diversity,
but
the
question...
but
that
is
the
case
because
in
that
case
there
has
been
displacement,
which
is
itself
the
question
presented
here.
i
would
agree,
for
instance,
as
the
chief
justice's
example
said,
that
you
can't
get
around
the
application
of
the
jones
act
by
pleading
diversity
and
if,
in
fact,
we
had
a
substantive
maritime
claim,
that
was
clearly
a
federal
maritime
claim
that
applied
and
that
was
mandatory
because
of
the
necessity
for
uniformity.
we
couldn't
get
around
it
by
pleading
diversity.
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
in
that
case,
we
probably
would
have
filed
it
in
state
court,
but
i
would
agree
with
justice
ginsburg
that
in
that
case,
even
by
going
into
the
state
court,
if
federal
maritime
law
applies
the
substantive
principle,
the
reverse
erie
issue,
we
would
have
had
to
apply
federal
maritime
law
even
if
the
choice
of
forum
was
the
state
court.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is...
we
certainly
do
not
have
to
decide
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
correct,
your
honor.
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
as
long
as
we
have
that
qualifier,
that's
right.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
believe
that
the
petitioners
are
arguing
that
in
this
case
anything
that
looks
to
state
law
automatically
undermines
federal
law.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
i...
well,
i
care
in
the
sense
that
i
know
what
they
are
arguing
for.
they
argued
before
judge
pollack
that
we're
entitled
to
nothing
but
funeral
expenses
for
the
death
of--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
they
pick
up
a
lot
less
o
the
remedy
side
than
most
state
wrongful
death--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
part
of
my
plea
is
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
civilians...
that
is,
nonseamen,
nonlongshoremen...
that
we
ought
not
to
start
pushing
them
into
the
maritime
field
when
there's
no
federal
interest
in
doing
so
except
this
rather
generalized
interest
in
uniform--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i
have
not
been
able
to
figure
it
out
entirely
either,
your
honor,
but
i
do
think
that
there
is
probably
on
the
remedy
side,
as
opposed
to
the
primary
duty
side,
a
fair
amount
of
differences
among
the
states...
that
is,
nuances
differences.
indeed,
even
in
the
federal
statutes
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
the
jones
act,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act,
even
those
federal
statutes
sometimes
you
get
full
compensation,
the
longshoreman
statute
only
gets
3,000
in
funeral
expenses,
everybody
else
gets--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--in
my
view,
it
would
have
been...
she
should
have
and
would
have
been
entitled
to
sue
under
state
law,
and...
but
i
recognize
that
there
are
some
cases
that
call
that
into
question.
i'd
begin
with
jensen,
and
i
don't
want
to
take
part
of
the
court's
debate
about
the
continuing
validity
of
jensen
in
this
context,
but
i
would
point
out
jensen
did
involve
the
marine
worker,
a
longshoreman,
in
that
case.
the
pope
and
talbot
case
and
some
others
have
suggested
that
state
law
cannot
apply
where
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
maritime
law.
in
my
view,
there's
no
principle
of
maritime
law
that
would
be
applicable
to
this
case.
as
justice
kennedy
said,
there's
no
federal
interest
in
the
regulation
of
this
kind
of
jet
ski
accident
involving
civilians,
so
in
my
view
we
would
not
have
the
situation
where
we
would
have
to
apply
maritime
law,
but
i
recognize
that
there
are
some
portions
of
some
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
cited
by
the
petitioners
and
the
government,
that
suggest
that
state
law
as
a
personal
injury
as
opposed
to
a
death
case
would
not
apply.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
there
may
be
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
the
question
then
is,
what
substantive
law
must
we
apply,
and
i
am
confident,
as
this
court
mentioned
in
some
of
its
cases,
this
is
like
bell
v.
hood.
that
is,
on
the
one
had,
the
question
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction;
having
gotten
over
that,
what
cause
of
action,
and
what
cause
of
action
depends
upon
what
substantive
law
is
going
to
apply.
i
want
to--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i
guess
my...
there's
certainly
a
logical
possibility.
my
suggestion
to
you
is
that
that
kind
of
roundabout
approach
is
unnecessary
here,
and
was
not
followed
for
100
years
from
before
the
harrisburg
right
up
through
moragne,
where
we
looked
to
state
law
because
it
was
available
and
there,
and
there
was
no
particular
reason
to
look
for
federal
law.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
so
at
that
time,
because
the
admiralty
law
was
clear
that
there
was
no
federal
maritime
wrongful
death
remedy,
and
you
had
to
look
to
state
law,
as
there
was
in
the
harrisburg,
as
there
was
in
moragne,
as
there
has
been
in
other
cases.
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
case,
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
not
the
owner
of
the
vessel.
it
is
not
anybody
who
was
driving
the
vessel.
it
is
the
manufacturer
of
the
vessel,
and
the
claim
in
moragne
was
a
claim
based
on
unseaworthiness,
and
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
a
manufacturer
of
a
vessel
has
been
held
liable
for
a
maritime
tort
based
on
the
claim
of
unseaworthiness,
nor
has
this
court
ever
allowed
civilians
to
sue
for
unseaworthiness.
the
kermarec
case
in
this
court
in
1959
involved
an
invitee
aboard
a
vessel.
it
was
clearly
in
territorial
waters.
the
court
refused
to
allow
a
person
aboard
a
vessel
to
sue
for
unseaworthiness.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
the
court
has
never
decided
how...
who
might
be
eligible
to
rely
on
a
claim
of
unseaworthiness.
that
is,
we
know
in
kermarec
that
a
person
aboard
a
vessel
that
was
moored
to
a
ship,
to
a
dock,
was
not
entitled
to
it.
there
may
be
other
persons.
for
instance,
if
someone,
a
civilian
were
riding
a
pleasure
boat
in
navigable
waters,
a
pleasure
boat
or
a
tug
of
some
kind
or
other,
and
the
vessel
was
actually
underway,
it
would
be
a
different
case
from
kermarec.
i
don't
know
what
other
cases
it
would
apply
to.
the
statute
now
has
been
amended
so
that
the
longshoreman
in
moragne
would
not
even
make
it
available.
it
was,
of
course,
in
moragne
an
additional
remedy,
in
addition
to
the
state
court
remedy,
in
addition
to
the
state
court
remedy,
and
in
addition
to
the
longshoreman's
remedy
that
he
had...
that
the
state
had
against
the
employer.
this
was
a
third
claim
that
was
made
available
in
the
face
of
two
existing
claims,
this
third
claim
being
against
the
owner
of
the
vessel.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
these
cases
come
up
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
important
to
remember
that
moragne
was
a
case
of
generosity.
this
court
said,
we're
going
to
apply
additional
remedies.
there
was
not
a
hint
in
moragne
of
a
cutback,
of
a
displacement.
the
price
of
getting
the
unseaworthiness
remedy
was
the
loss
of
the
remedy
for
state
law
violations,
and
that
seems
to
be
the
question
as
to
whether...
in
terms
of
the
intent
of
moragne,
it
seems
very
difficult,
in
terms
of
classical
preemption
analysis
displacement
on
the
water,
to
find
the
kind
of
intent
to
make
the
price
being
paid
the
loss
of
one
remedy
in
exchange
for
the
grant
of
the
other.
unlike--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
was
addressing
the
question
of
whether
moragne
itself
did
it.
i
want
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
whether
it
makes
any
sense--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
there
is
clearly
some
language
about
uniformity
in
there,
your
honor--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--and
i
certainly
would
not
extend
to
the
contrary.
when
this
court
has
concerned
itself
with
problems
of
uniformity,
it
has
focused
principally
on
the
primary
conduct
of
the
persons
being
affected,
citing,
in
american
dredging
and
elsewhere,
the
need
to
focus
on
primary
conduct.
the
primary
conduct
argument
is
irrelevant
here.
it's
irrelevant
because
yamaha
makes
jet
skis.
those
jet
skis
operate
on
inland
waters,
but
they
also...
they
operate
on
territorial
waters,
and
they
also
operate
on
purely
inland
waters,
as
to
which
there
is
no
federal
maritime
claim
at
all.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
would
at
least
say,
your
honor,
as
to
manufacturers
as
opposed
to
vessel
owners,
which
is
what
moragne
was
actually
dealing
with,
we
are
in
a
different
category
of
individuals,
companies,
and
i
think
the
principle
difference
is
that
the
connection
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
territorial
waters
is
a
good
deal
more
attenuated
than
the
connection
is
between
a
vessel
owner
or
a
vessel
operator
with
concerns
about
commercial
navigation,
other
kinds
of
commercial
activity,
which
has
animated
this
court's
maritime--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
is,
most
of
the
circuits
have
come
out
the
other
way.
i
don't
think
most
of
them
have
gone
through
the
analysis
that
we
have
gone
through,
looking
at
the
history.
they've
simply
said,
moragne
represented
what
some
of
them
referred
to
as
a
sea
change,
and
we
have
simply...
don't
believe
that
moragne
itself
did
it.
but
i
think
the
point,
your
honor,
is,
rather
than
creating
a
whole
new
complicated
set
of
maritime
rules
we
should
continue
to
do
what
the
court
did
before
moragne,
which
was
to
say...
and
there
was
no
great
problem
before
moragne
applying
state
wrongful
death
statutes
in
territorial
waters
to
persons
who
are
not
in
the
maritime
trade.
after
all,
it's
a
relatively
small
number
of
cases.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
to
my
knowledge
they
have
not.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--but
the
law
of
punitive
damages
had--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--the
law
of
punitive
damages
has
developed
considerably
since
1970,
in
the
era
of
moragne.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--you
mean...
your
honor,
you're
talking
about
state
law?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
believe
the
answer
is
yes,
but
i
can't
cite
you
chapter
and
verse
on
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
most
maritime
workers
are
now
covered
by
federal
statutes,
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
and
jones
act
seamen.
accidents
on
the
high
seas
are
covered
by
federal
statute,
so
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about
now
is
civilians
injured
and
killed
in...
killed
in
territorial
waters.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it's
also
more
predictable.
that
is,
we
know
what
the
state
law
is
now--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i
don't
think
the
question
is
why...
with
all
respect
to
your
honor,
why
there
should
be
that
way.
the
question
is
that
congress
has
set
up
a
scheme
for
the
compensation
of
various
categories
of
persons.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
there
are,
of
course...
the
question
is
which
law
one
would
apply.
that
is,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
only
applies
to
deaths.
it
doesn't
apply
to
personal
injuries.
so
if
a
person
is
a
personal
injury
victim
on
the
high
seas,
he
or
she
has
to
repair
to
some
other
law
to
begin
with.
so
could
we
look
to
the
jones
act?
well,
the
jones
act
deals
with
sailors.
it
provides
certain
levels
of
compensation.
it
has
a
modified
scheme
of
liability
which
is
different
from
the
jones...
from
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act
is
a
no-fault,
entirely
no-fault
scheme,
and
so
that
even
within
the
federal
system,
there's
a
significant
amount
of
disunity.
and
i
guess
my
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court
has
permitted
state
wrongful
death,
and
i
would
think
personal
injury
cases,
to
exist
in
territorial
waters
for
many
years.
congress
has
said,
we're
going
to
come
in
with
certain
remedies.
congress
is
fully
within
its
power,
if
it
thinks
that
uniformity
is
necessary
as
to
this
rather
narrow
category
of
groups,
to
come
in
and
say,
we
want
to
do
for
territorial
waters
what
we
did
for
deaths
on
the
high
seas,
and
by
the
way,
we
also
ought
to
do
something
about
personal
injuries
in--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
congress
hasn't
said...
congress
hasn't
passed--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--but
i
don't
think...
congress
has
not
addressed
the
issue
except
in
one
respect,
your
honor,
and
i
will
point
this
out.
in
1980,
congress
passed
a
statute
which
is
applicable
to
this
case,
or
to
a
limited
part
of
this
case.
it
said
that
the
statute
of
limitations
for
all
maritime
torts
is
3
years...
death,
personal
injury,
high
seas,
territorial
water...
and
i
think
that's
evidence
that
when
congress
has
seen
a
need
for
uniformity,
a
need
for
clarity,
it
has
come
in
and
superseded
both
federal
statutes
and
state
statutes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
your
honors
applied
laches
beforehand.
in
the
maritime--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--your
honor--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--your
honor,
let
me...
we
are
talking
about
pennsylvania's
remedial
statute.
she
was
a
resident
of--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--your
honor,
as
far
as
we
know,
there
is
no
difference
on
the
substantive
standard
of
liability
in
any
one
of...
in
any
of
these
cases.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
she
was
a...
i'm
talking
about
the
substantive
standard
applied
to
the
primary
conduct.
she
was
a
resident
of
pennsylvania.
we
believe
under
choice
of
law
principles
we're
entitled
in
the
measure
of
recovery
for
wrongful
death
to
apply
the
law
of
the
residence
of
the
person
whose
death
we
are...
at
issue
here,
that
that
is
consistent
and
proper,
and
that
is
the
reason
that
we
filed
this...
this
case
was
filed
in
pennsylvania.
there
is,
of
course,
another
aspect
which
the
plaintiffs,
the
petitioners
don't
want
to
talk
about,
and
that
is,
the
theory
of
displacement
of
moragne
is
that
we
are...
we
take
the
moragne
cause
of
action
and
apply
it.
if
you
do
that
literally,
what
you
have
done
is,
you
must
have
applied
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness,
because
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of
which
displaces
something
with
nothing,
and
that
is,
presumably
if
this
case
is
governed
by
federal
law
of
moragne
it
is
the
law
of
unseaworthiness.
and
then
the
question
is,
how
does
one
determine
the
seaworthiness
or
unseaworthiness
of
a
jet
ski,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
simply
is
a
further
reason
that
if
you're
talking
about
uniformity,
you've
got
to
take
the
good
with
the
bad,
which
in
this
case
would
be
unseaworthiness,
and
it
ought
not
to
be
an
inquiry
of
the
federal
courts
when
we
have
had
for
more
than
100
years
perfectly
adequate
state
law
remedies.
the
only
reason
that
they
are
here
is
not
because
they're
complaining
that
states
are
imposing
primary
conduct
obligations
that
are
inconsistent,
but
because
they
want
to
pay
less,
and
they
think
they
can
do
it
by
doing
it
that
way.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
not--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--if
the
court
is
sitting
in
the
diversity
side,
under
subject
matter
jurisdiction--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
your
honor,
if
you're
applying
state
law,
which
is
what
you
are
doing
in
the
diversity--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
if
it
is
a
federal...
if
it
is
an
admiralty
case
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
federal
maritime
cause
of
action--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--not
if
the
substantive
law
applies
as
state
law.
obviously,
the
federal
court--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
i
think
that
that...
well,
the
first
question
is
a
choice
between
federal
and
state
law.
i
think
that
we...
that
the
complainant
in
a
case
like
this
has
the
right
to
choose
to
go
under
state
law,
taking
with
it
the
good
and
the
bad.
maybe
there's
a
claim
under
federal
law.
we
haven't
made
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
believe
it
would
be...
the
choice
of
law
rules
would
be--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
statute.
it
says
the
law
of
where
the
accident
shall
have
occurred,
because
congress
has
specifically
enumerated
that
shall
be
the
choice.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
if
we
have
federal
substantive
law,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
i
am
saying
that
the
governing
principle
is
state
law,
not
state
law
as
there
because
it's
been
adopted
as
analogous
to
federal
law.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
the
answer
is
unclear,
your
honor.
the
government
has
cited
a
bunch
of
cases
in
its
brief
saying
that
we
would
be
bound
by
federal
law.
we
have
explained
in
our
brief
why
we
think
those
cases
do
not
necessarily
apply,
but
i
think...
this
court
has
never,
to
my
knowledge,
decided
that
question.
but
i
believe...
i
would
confess
that
the
answer
to
that
question
must
be
the
same.
it
would
make
no
sense
that...
to
have
a
regime
under
which
the
question
of
whether
someone
lived
or
died
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law
in
one
case
and
federal
law
in
the
other.
it
would
not
be
a
sensible
regime.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
you'll
have
to
ask
them.
