chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-1387,
yamaha
motor
corporation
v.
lucien
calhoun.
mr.
bartlett,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
actually
know
what
difference
it
makes
as
to
what
this
particular
plaintiff
recovers
which
view
prevails?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
at
this
stage,
we're
deciding
a
fairly
abstract
question,
and
conceivably
it
might
not
make
any
difference,
is
that
correct,
that
puerto
rico
might
have
the
same
rule
as
the
general
maritime
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
bartlett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
engelmayer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
i
get
the
sense
we
don't
know
what
the
state
remedies
are,
and
we
don't
know
what
the
admiralty
remedies
are.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we're
talking
about
a
very
abstract
proposition
that
may
make
no
difference
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
engelmayer.
mr.
morrison,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
first
inquiry
in
any
federal
court--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
seaman,
the
executor
of
a
seaman
comes
into
court
and
says,
my...
the
seaman
had
an
unseaworthiness
claim
against
a
vessel,
and
so
i'm
suing...
i'm
suing
the
shipowner,
and
i'm
suing
him
diversity
of
citizenship.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
all
this
admiralty
business.
do
you
think
that
that
simply
forecloses
admiralty
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
would
envision
a
different
result,
then,
if
there
had
been
no
diversity
of
citizenship
in
this
case.
then
the
person
would
have
had
to
come
into
admiralty,
and
i
take
it
it
must
mean
make
some
difference
to
you
if
you're
insisting
on
diversity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
our
foremost
decision,
which
says
that
pleasure
boating
comes
within
admiralty,
is
certainly
a
precedent
that
might
suggest
there's
admiralty
jurisdiction
just
on
the
basis
of
the
jet
ski
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
are
you
picking
pennsylvania
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
morrison.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.94-1387,
yamaha
motor
corporation
versus
calhoun
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
