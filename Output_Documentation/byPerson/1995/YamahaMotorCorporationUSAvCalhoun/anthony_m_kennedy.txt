do
the
definitions
of
the
primary
duty
possibly
differ,
depending
on
the
rule
we
adopt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
when
we're
deciding
this
case,
i
assume
we
should
consider
that
the
consequences
of
our
decision
may
have
some
bearing
on
how
the
primary
duty
will
be
defined
in
other
cases
that
come
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
are
you
just
confining
your
argument
to
questions
of
damages
and
remedy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
is
very
odd,
because
in
state
territorial
waters,
local
sheriffs
routinely
enforce
safety
ordinance,
they
inspect
for
life
preservers,
they
tag
vessels
that
are
operating
at
illegal
speeds,
and
then
suddenly
the
law
is
displaced
because
a
state
has
no
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
it
might
sound
like
a
quibble,
but
it's
important
to
me,
in
any
event.
you
said
the
question
is
whether
or
not
state
law
has
been
displaced.
is
the
question
whether
or
not
state
law
should
be
displaced?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
the
admiralty
law
could
take
that
into
account.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
foist
onto
the
legal
profession
and
the
citizens
a
very,
very
complex
requirement
to
determine
which
law
they're
proceeding
under.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
might
just
say
that
i
take
it
your
position
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
most
of
the
circuits--
