mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
maritime
collision
case.
that
means,
as
the
third
circuit
acknowledged,
that
substantive
admiralty
and
maritime
law
applies.
where
the
third
circuit
went
astray,
however,
was
in
holding
that
maritime
law
does
not
supply
the
rule
of
decision.
it
does.
that
rule
is
the
general
maritime
law
death
remedy
announced
by
this
court
in
moragne,
and
because
this
is
a
maritime
case,
the
choice
of
law
analysis
is
that
of
american
dredging.
first,
moragne.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
well,
of
course,
the
damages
issues,
the
exact
elements
of
damages
issue
was
not
accepted
by
this
court,
although
it
was
one
of
those
that
was...
we
asked
the
court
to
address.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
i
believe
you
are
addressing,
in
that
sense,
an
abstract
question,
yes,
and,
indeed,
the
damages
issues
can
go
either
way,
depending
upon
what
state
law
you're
applying,
not
just
puerto
rico
or
pennsylvania,
but
my
own
state
of
maryland,
would
have
differences
between
those.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
i
do
not
believe
so.
the
primary
duty
would
be,
of
course,
set
out
in
the
various
liability
theories.
in
this
particular
case,
maritime
law
addresses
or
accepts
and
recognizes
all
of
the
various
theories
for
product
liability...
strict
product
liability,
negligence,
and
warranty...
but
that
would
not
be
the
case,
say,
for
example,
were
the
plaintiff
or
the
victim
to
have
died
in
the
territorial
waters
of
delaware.
delaware
does
not
recognize
strict
liability
in
tort
product
defects,
so
negligence
would
be
there.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
certainly--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--no.
i
think...
yamaha
is
a
boat
manufacturer,
but
it
stands
in
the
shoes
of
any
potential
maritime
defendant
who
could
be
sued
for
the
death
of
a
"civilian".
it
could
be
a
shipowner.
it
could
be
shipbuilder.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
no.
seaworthiness
is
a--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--has
a
theory
of
liability
that
is
only
available
to
a
jones
act
seaman.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
well,
the
strict
liability
theory
is
certainly
an
absolute
liability
theory,
so
if
it
was
a
claim
that
the
ship
or
a
passenger
on
a
ship
was
injured
by
some
defect
or
defective
design
of
the
ship
or
the
boat,
then
you
would
have
an
absolute
liability
theory
under
which
the
plaintiff
could
recover,
but
it
would
not
be
the
unseaworthiness
theory.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
we
have
a...
we
have
negligence
but
there's
also
a
claim
in
strict
liability,
which
this
court
recognized
as
being
viable
under
maritime
law
in
the
east
river
case.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
no,
i
don't.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
first
of
all,
i
think
moragne
precludes
the
remedy
of
state
wrongful
death,
but
it
doesn't
preempt
any
theory
along
those
lines,
so--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--what
theory
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
correct.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
and
you
have.
certainly
in
the
east
river
case
you
adopted
a
common
law
rule
that
was
based
upon
looking
at
what
the
states
did,
what
the
restatement
says,
and
you
adopted
in
essence
the
402(a)
section
absolute
strict
liability
for
product
defect,
and
you
said--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--correct.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
correct.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
yes,
because
i
believe
the
moragne
theory
of
recovery
adapts
itself,
or
allows
itself
to
go
forward
under
any
theory
of
liability,
be
it
strict
product
liability,
be
it
negligence--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
yes,
well,
the
harrisburg,
of
course,
held
that
there
was
no
wrongful
death
remedy.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
yes,
because
this
court
allowed
state
wrongful
death
statutes
to
provide
a
remedy
where
the
harrisburg
said
there
was
none
under
the
general
maritime
law.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
that
was
because,
i
believe,
that
the
congress,
when
it
passed
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
was
providing
the
remedy
where
there
was
none.
it
was
solving
the
problem--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--that
was
presented
to
it.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
i
think
the
logic
of
moragne
is
such
that
you
can
only
read
it
as
providing
a
uniform
death
remedy
that
is
to
apply
to
the
exclusion
of
state
wrongful
death
statutes.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
it
only
went
to
the
unseaworthiness
theory
of
liability,
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--no,
i
don't.
i
believe
the
moragne
remedy
provides
both
a
wrongful
death
remedy
and
several
of
the
lower
courts
have
also
held
that
it
can
provide
a
survival--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--yes.
well,
this
court
in
foremost
and
sisson
held
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
extended
to
all
navigable
waters,
and
certainly
where
a
recreational
boat
collision,
as
was
the
case
in
this
case,
was
involved.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
i
believe
it
is,
because
the
constitution,
article
iii,
section
2,
spoke
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
courts,
and
with
that
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
again
that
that
power
meant
that
the
federal
courts
were
to
fashion
this
general
maritime
law,
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
moragne.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
sir--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--this
court
has
held
in
the
east
river
case
and
articulated
in
several
other
cases
that
with
admiralty
jurisdiction
comes
admiralty
substantive
laws.
certainly
that
isn't
a
situation
that
always
occurs.
there
are
certain
situations
that
this
court
has
recognized
where
state
law
or
state
interests
will
be
allowed
to
overcome
that
presumption,
if
you
will,
that
maritime
substantive
law
applies.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
not
at
all.
i
believe
that
was
this
court
trying
to,
without
specifically
overruling
the
harrisburg,
nevertheless
allowing
a
remedy.
the
harrisburg
was
a
wrong
decision.
this
court
later
in
moragne
said
it
was.
but
in
the
meantime,
without
overruling
harrisburg,
this
court
allowed
the
state
wrongful
death
statutes
to
ameliorate,
as
it
were,
the
harsh
effects
of
the
harrisburg
rule.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
in
this
particular
area,
wrongful
death
remedies,
i
think
not.
however,
what
an
admiralty
court
should
do--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--it
would
depend
on
how
the
swimmer
died,
your
honor.
for
example,
i
would
contend
that
if
a
boat
in
navigation
was
the
force
that
caused
the
swimmer
to
die,
then
admiralty
jurisdiction
would
be
present,
and
substantive
admiralty
law
would
apply.
if
the
swimmer,
on
the
other
hand,
was
just
swimming
from
shore
with
no
relationship--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--excuse
me?
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
it
would
depend,
i
think--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--i...
certainly
we're
getting
toward
that
line
there,
but
if
the
water
ski--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--there
would
be
no
state
law
remedy.
the
moragne--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--i
believe
you
are
still
going
to
have
to
do
that
because
you've
still
got
navigation
of
a
boat.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
oh,
well,
the
state
certainly
has
an
interest,
but
so
does
the
federal
government.
i
think
you'll
find
in
this
area
that
there
are
specific
statutes
and
regulations.
for
example,
the
coast
guard
administers
safety
on
navigable
territorial
waters,
but
there
is
also
legislation
and
regulations
that
cede
certain
responsibilities
to
the
state.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
i
believe
it's
both,
your
honor.
i
believe
it's
article
iii,
section
2,
and
this
court's
and
the
lower
court's,
as
is
to
be
done
forming
the
general
maritime
law
that
admiralty
practitioners
such
as
myself
depend
upon.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
well,
punitive
damages
are
available
under
maritime
law.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
yes,
but--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--well,
the
current
jurisprudence
is
a
trend
against
them,
i
must
admit,
but
as
it
stands
now--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
i
think
you
look
to
the
entire
body
of
not
just
one
state's
law
but
many
states'
laws.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
well,
i
believe
this
court,
for
example
in
the
east
river
case,
looked
to
see
what
the
other...
what
all
of
the
states
were
doing
with
respect
to
the
remedy
for
strict
liability
for
product
defect,
also
looked
to
the
restatement,
and
then
formed
the
general
maritime
law
rule
from
that,
so--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--well,
your
honor
also
looked
to
state
law
in
lyon
v.
the
ranger
iii,
when
you
sat
on
the
first
circuit--
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
--and
you
looked
to
rhode
island
law
on
an
issue
of
law
that
the
maritime
law
was
silent
on,
and
that's
exactly
how
the
general
maritime
law
is
to
be
formed,
looking
to
other
sources.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
again,
well,
that
was
post-harrisburg
and
pre-moragne,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
bartlett,
iii
thank
you.
