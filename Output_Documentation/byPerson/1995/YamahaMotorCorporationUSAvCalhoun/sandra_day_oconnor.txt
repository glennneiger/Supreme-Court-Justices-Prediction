justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bartlett,
to
put
it
another
way,
it
seems
to
me
for
you
to
prevail
we
would
have
to
extend
moragne,
because
it
didn't
really
cover
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you'd
have
to
extend
it.
do
you
see
any
room
in
state
territorial...
in
territorial
waters
for
both
admiralty
law
and
state
law,
depending
on
the
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
a
division
of
opinion
on
whether
moragne
should
be
extended
to
this,
but
it...
what
is
the
federal
interest
in
uniformity
in
connection
with
a
jet
ski
accident
in
territorial
waters?
why
do
we
need
to
apply
admiralty
law
and
seek
uniformity?
why
isn't
that
much
closer
to
traditional
state
negligence
actions,
where
state
law
should
govern?
i
mean,
territorial
waters
encompass
navigable
waters
within
a
state,
do
they
not,
rivers,
lakes,
so
forth,
and
up
to
3
miles
out
to
sea.
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
can
be
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
territorial
waters,
we've
so
held,
but
perhaps
it's
limited
to
where
there's
really
a
federal
interest,
where
there
are
seamen
involved,
or
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers,
or
something
of
that
sort.
is
it
necessary
that
it
extend...
admiralty
rule
of
law
extend
to
recreational
boating
accidents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
concede
the
federal
court
has
admiralty
jurisdiction
over
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
it's
federal
law,
but
federal
law
says
we'll
look
to
state
law.
i
think
that's
what
justice
breyer
has
directed
himself--
