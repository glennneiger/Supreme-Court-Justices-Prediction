unknown
speaker
did
the
supreme
court
of
montana
agree
with
you
that
the
substantive
law
had
been
changed?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
the
supreme
court
of
montana
found
that
under
the
statute
the
defendant
had
to
be
proven
to
have
acted
knowingly
and
purposely.
unknown
speaker
and
the
supreme
court
so
indicated,
did
it
not--
unknown
speaker
--in
its
opinion?
unknown
speaker
in
its
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
that
under
the
statute
the
state
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
acted
knowingly
and
purposely?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
were
evidence
that
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
crime
had
passed
out
from
voluntary
intoxication,
under
the
statute
that
evidence
could
not
be
brought
in
by
the
defense.
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
go
to
that,
you
think?
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
insanity
in
montana?
can
a
defendant
bring
in
evidence
to
show
that
his
mental
condition
was
such
that
he
couldn't
have
acted
purposely?
unknown
speaker
how
about
involuntary
intoxication?
unknown
speaker
how
about
involuntary
intoxication,
someone
put
a
mickey
in
his
drink?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
he
could
rely
on
such
evidence?
unknown
speaker
so
intoxication
can
be
relevant
to
whether
an
act
is
done
knowingly
and
purposefully?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let's
just
focus
on
mental
state
for
a
moment.
intoxication
can
be
relevant
to
the
determination
of
mental
state
if
we're
interested
in
what
that
mental
state
was.
unknown
speaker
montana
itself
says
that,
because
involuntary
intoxication
is
deemed
sufficiently
important
so
that
the
jury
can
consider
it.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
involuntary
the
legislature
has
recognized
that
that
can
bear
on
the
formation
of
the
requisite
criminal
intent.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
point
really
is
that
the
legislature
has
said
that
in...
purposeful
and
so
forth,
you
have
to
prove
that,
except
that
the
defendant
may
not
show
that
whatever
lack
of
purposefulness
he
had
resulted
from
voluntary
consumption
of
liquor.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
deny
that
it's
logically
relevant.
unknown
speaker
or
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
seem
to
be
trying
to
deny
it's
logically
relevant.
unknown
speaker
the
man
is
so
drunk
he
thinks
he's
shooting
an
pink
elephant,
and
he's
shooting
a
human
being.
now--
unknown
speaker
--surely
that's
logically
relevant--
unknown
speaker
--to
whether
he's...
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
legislature
perhaps
could
have
written
a
law
to
say
that
a
person
who
acts
while
voluntarily
intoxicated
has
the
mental
state
required
for
a
conviction
of
a
certain
offense.
they
could
have
written
it
that
way--
unknown
speaker
--but
didn't.
unknown
speaker
instead,
they
left
a
statute
in
place
that
said
the
state
has
to
prove
knowing
and
purposeful.
unknown
speaker
and
the
condition
of
his
mental
state
by
virtue
of
alcoholism
is...
or
the
alcohol
he
had
consumed
is,
you
admit,
logically
relevant?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
any
due
process
requirement,
do
you
think,
in
any
criminal
case
that
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
produce
evidence
that
is
relevant
in
his
defense?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
you
couldn't
say,
you're
guilty
of
robbery
and
the
prosecution
can
present
its
case
but
it's
legally
irrelevant
to
hear
from
the
defendant.
you
couldn't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
here
what
you've
said
is,
it's
legally
necessary
to
prove
the
person
did
have
purpose
or
intent,
and
here
is
some
evidence
that
will
prove
to
the
contrary
but
it's
legally
irrelevant,
i.e.,
you
won't
let
him
present
the
evidence
that
is
highly
likely
to
prove
to
the
contrary,
so
what's
the
justification
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but
the
supreme
court
of
montana
based
its
decision
not
on
lack
of
evidence,
as
i
understand
it,
but
on
the
instruction
it
was
given.
unknown
speaker
but
the
jury
was
told
it
couldn't
consider
evidence
of
respondent's
voluntary
intoxication.
unknown
speaker
is
it--
--general
mazurek,
the
argument,
or
suggestion
at
least
is
made
by
the
people
on
the
other
side
that
you
could
accomplish
what
you
want
to
accomplish
without
skirting,
if
not
confronting
some
of
these
constitutional
problems
if
the
state
had
simply
passed
a
statute
saying,
anybody
who
is
intoxicated
and
who
kills
another
human
being
is
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
or
they
could
have
said,
anyone
who
does
it
except
while
driving
a
car,
to
preserve
the
negligent
homicide
case,
but
it
could
have
made
intoxication
plus
causing
death
a
crime.
the
suggestion
is,
no
problem.
why
shouldn't
the
state
do
that
and,
if
you
know,
why
didn't
the
state
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
it...
in
other
words...
you
know,
if
you
were
saying...
you
are
saying
to
us
that
the
statute
uses
knowingly
and
purposely
in
its
usual
legal
sense.
you're
not
saying,
well,
there's
a
special
meaning
to
it
because
it's...
it
is
modified
by
the
fact
that
you
cannot
negate
it
by
intoxication.
you're
not
saying
that.
you're
saying,
it
means...
those
two
terms
mean
what
they
normally
mean,
the
model
penal
code
and
the
definition
of
the
statute,
and
so
on.
and
so
that
creates
a
difficulty
for
you,
because
it
certainly
is,
in
fact,
relevant
to
those
two
states
of
mind
whether
someone
is
intoxicated
or
not,
whereas
if
you
were
to
have
a
statute
that
says,
look,
voluntary
intoxication,
plus
causation,
is
a
crime.
then
you
wouldn't
have
that
problem.
why
don't
you
do
it
that
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that's
what
they--
unknown
speaker
--that's
what
they
did.
let
me--
unknown
speaker
--why?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you--
unknown
speaker
--general--
--i
understand
that,
but--
--do
you
agree
that
the
statute
described
would
produce
the
same
result
as
the
statute
here,
the
statute
that
said
anyone
who,
when
intoxicated,
knowingly
kills
a
human
being
is
guilty
of
murder?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
it
will
produce
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--sure
i
left
out
knowingly,
because
your
problem
is
in
having
knowingly
and
not
allowing
relevant
evidence
to
determine
whether
it
was
knowing
or
not.
but
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
justice
scalia
has.
do
you
agree
that
the
state
could
have
done
what
your
opponent
suggests
you
could
have
done?
do
you
agree
that
you
had
that
alternative?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
whether
you
concede
it,
too.
the
state
could
have
done
that?
unknown
speaker
i
wish
you
would
describe
to
me
how,
because
i
don't
concede
it.
i
don't
understand
how
the
state
could
have
gotten
precisely
this
result
in
any
other
way.
unknown
speaker
to
still
require
knowingly...
to
still
require
knowing,
and
yet
not
allow
evidence
of
intoxication
to
be
used
with
respect
to
the
knowing.
that's
a
quite
different
disposition
from
anything
else
that
could
have
been
crafted.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mazurek,
do
i
understand
the
legislation
right,
that
the
only
change
from
the
way
it
was
was
the
insertion
of
the
word
not?
basically,
that
was
the
change.
unknown
speaker
well,
i--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
general
mazurek.
mr.
estrada.
mr.
estrada,
i
don't
want
to
spoil
your
order,
but
sometime
in
the
course
of
your
argument
would
you
address
the
question
that
justice
scalia
and
i
were
posing
to
general
mazurek?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
have
to
be
now,
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
what
i
thought
the
argument
was,
and
then
i
thought
the
state
was
in
fact...
i
thought
the
state
had
clearly
jettisoned
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
mean
in
the
argument
here.
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
position
the
state
was
taking.
unknown
speaker
well,
is--
unknown
speaker
--is...
do
you
think
that
position
that
in
fact
there
is
a
change
in
the
meaning
of
purpose
and
knowing,
and
so
on?
is
that
consistent
with
what
the
state
court
found
or
construed?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
say
that
the
state
no
longer
in
montana
has
to
prove
knowing
and
purposely
killing?
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me,
mr.
estrada,
has...
what...
has
the
state
here
said
in
effect
that
this
knowledge
and
purpose
is
usually
present
in
the
intoxicated
person,
and
the
jury
can
usually
find
it
despite
the
fact
of
the
intoxication,
or
has
it
said
that
we
don't
care
about
conscious
purpose
if
the
person
is
intoxicated?
it's
not
clear
to
me
the
logical
and
the
common
sense
basis
for
the
common
law
rule
that
you're
proposing.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
fair
answer
to
justice...
isn't
the
question
whether
you
can
determine
whether
the
intent
was
there
or
not,
not
why,
or...
and
is
it
not
true
that
if
a
person...
if
the
defendant
got
on
the
stand
and
said
i
thought
i
was
shooting
at
a
pink
elephant,
or,
to
take
justice
scalia's
example,
if
he's
not
able
to
say
he
was
totally
intoxicated
at
the
time,
no
one
would
ever
believe
him.
unknown
speaker
and
he
can
also
show
that
he
didn't
have
the
intent
by
means
other
than
invoking
the
drunkenness.
he
can
show
from
witnesses
that
this
person
didn't
seem
to
know
what
he
was
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
he
could
do
that.
unknown
speaker
even
though
that
was
the
effect
of
the
drunkenness.
unknown
speaker
but
in
your
first
case
you
would
not
allow
a
doctor
to
testify
as
to
the
blood
level,
blood
alcohol
content.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
you
only
get
those
circumstances
if
you
happen
to
have
a
videotape.
unknown
speaker
in
most
cases
that
doesn't
happen.
unknown
speaker
are
you
making
a
harmless
error
argument?
unknown
speaker
i've
one
question
which
i
say,
in
many
cases
this
will
work
out
fine,
but
some
it
might
not.
i
take
it
if
you
wilfully,
intentionally
get
blind
drunk,
and
you
run
into
a
pedestrian
in
a
sidewalk
going
5
miles
an
hour
and
kill
him
at
4:00
in
the
morning,
you'll
probably
be
found
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
if
you
get
similarly,
absolutely
blind
drunk,
and
you
drive
at
95
miles
an
hour,
in
the
middle...
you
drive
95
miles
an
hour
and
run
into
somebody
because
you're
going
too
fast,
you
won't
get
convicted,
right,
because
there's
no
purpose,
there's
no
knowledge.
in
the
one
case...
and
i
don't
understand
how
any
state
could
make
such
a
distinction.
it
seems
irrational.
you
see,
what
you're
doing
is,
you're
saying
that
they
can't
use
it
to
rebut
knowledge
or
intent,
so
it
only
comes
in
in
a
case
where
there's
likely
to
be
purpose
and
knowledge
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
do
you
see--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
see...
i
know
we're
out
of
time,
or
we're
late,
so
if
you
can't
follow
it
i'll--
unknown
speaker
--what
rational
basis
could
there
be
for
convicting
a
blind
drunk
person
of
first
degree
murder
under
circumstances
where
knowledge
and
failure
to
say,
i'm
drunk,
leads
the
jury
to
conclude
you
knew
what
you
were
doing,
and
that
exact
same
thing
happening
in
circumstances
where
it
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
ms.
german,
we'll
hear
from
you.
is
it
german?
unknown
speaker
ms.
german--
--ms.
german,
don't
we
always...
i
mean,
there
are
lots
of...
there's
lots
of
relevant
evidence
that
is
excluded
traditionally
at
common
law.
there
are
all
sorts
of
privileges,
husband-wife
privilege,
a
priest-penitent
privilege,
evidence
will
be
excluded
that
is
totally
relevant
but
too
inflammatory,
evidence
may
be
excluded
because
it's
unlawfully
obtained...
i
don't
know
how
we
can
say,
as
a
general
matter,
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
exclude
relevant
evidence.
unknown
speaker
or
there's
a
policy
against
admitting
it--
unknown
speaker
--such
as--
unknown
speaker
--such
as
the
priest-penitent
privilege
or
the
husband-wife
privilege.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
get
you
home.
you
could
say
the
same
two
things
in
all
the
other
instances
i've
just
told
you.
unknown
speaker
it
is...
you
know,
it
is
relevant,
logically
relevant
to
the
point
that
must
be
proved.
nonetheless,
we
say
in
many
instances,
nonetheless
we
will
not
allow
it
in.
so
you
can't
say
that
automatically
that
establishes
a
constitutional
violation.
there
has
to
be
something
else
to
your
case
like,
for
example,
we've
never,
you
know,
traditionally
excluded
evidence
of
this
sort,
that
only...
states
can
only
exclude
relevant
evidence
in
situations
where
states
have
traditionally
done
it
in
our
common
law
system,
but
on
that
point
it
seems
to
me
the
history
is
against
you,
that
in
fact,
drunkenness
did
not
used
to
be
allowed
as
mitigating
the
offense.
unknown
speaker
well,
leaving
history
aside,
didn't
the
montana
supreme
court
say
on
the
hypotheses...
the
hypothesis
that
you
have
just
put
before
us
that
for
reasons
of
federal
constitutional
law,
there
is
something
illegitimate
about
a
state
policy
that
says,
we
are
going
to
exclude
what
would
otherwise
be
legally
relevant
evidence,
and
what
is,
in
fact,
factually
relevant
evidence
because
we
have
a
policy
of
discouraging
drunkenness,
and
of...
we
have
a
policy
that
refuses
to
allow
individuals
to
exculpate
their
conduct
because
of
intoxication?
didn't
montana
say,
for
reasons
of
federal
constitutional
law,
that
is
an
illegitimate
and
unconstitutional
policy?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
why
is--
unknown
speaker
--why
is,
then...
address
the
question
why
they
were
right.
why
is
it,
in
fact,
unconstitutional
to
say
exculpation
because
of
intoxication
is
illegitimate,
but
the
preservation,
let's
say,
of
the...
of
marital
privacy
on
the
husband
and
wife
privilege
is
perfectly
legitimate?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
you've
done
it
on
the
marital
privilege
case,
you've
done
it
on
the
fourth
amendment
case,
i
suppose,
although
in
that
instance
it's
working
against
the
government
so
that
you
say
there's
no
constitutional
problem--
unknown
speaker
--the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
montana
was
considerably
broader
than
you're
saying.
i
mean,
it
didn't
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
man
had.36
blood
alcohol.
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
defendant...
didn't
defendant
himself
ask
to
have
that
considered,
because
wasn't
his
defense,
i
didn't
do
it,
some
fourth
person
did
it--
unknown
speaker
--so
i
want
everybody
to
know
i
was
dead
drunk,
i
was
in
a
drunken
stupor?
so
it
was
not
just
the
state
that
was
saying,
this
is
a
bad
guy,
he
got
intoxicated.
defendant
himself
wanted
the
jury
to
believe
that
he
was
so
drunk
he
didn't
do
it,
so
the
evidence
was
there
to
help
the
defendant
make
that--
unknown
speaker
--part
of
his
case--
unknown
speaker
--but
nothing
would
have
impeded
the
defendant
from
making
that
defense
and
saying,
i
didn't
do
it
because
i
was
stone
drunk,
i
was
out,
and
introducing
that
evidence.
nothing
in
the
statute,
nothing
in
montana
law
would
preclude
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
answer,
i
thought
in
my
own
mind,
to
the
question
that
justice
scalia
and
others
were
asking,
we
always
exclude
a
lot
of
evidence.
why
is
this
any
different?
it
would
have
to
be,
what's
the
reason
that
you
want
to
exclude
this
evidence,
and
i
take
it
the
reason
they
want
to
exclude
this
evidence
is
because
they
want
to
convict
people
who
voluntarily
get
blind
drunk
of
first
degree
murder.
so
what's
wrong
with
that
as
a
reason?
that's
their
reason
for
excluding
the
evidence.
they
want
to
convict
the
person
who
voluntarily
gets
blind
drunk.
now,
to
my
suggestion
that
that's
irrational
to
convict
the
person
where
the
circumstances,
absent
the
drunkenness,
lead
to
an
inference
of
purpose,
compared
with
the
situation
where
the
circumstances
absent
the
drunkenness
lead
to
an
inference
of
negligence,
the
reply
was,
well,
that's
the
way
they
want
to
do
it,
and
what's
wrong
with
that?
so
that's
the
question
i'm
asking.
what's
wrong
with
that?
missouri
wants
to
convict
people
who...
montana,
sorry.
excuse
me.
anyway--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
is
not
what
the
effect
of
this
statute
is,
because
this
statute
does
convict
people
of
first
degree
murder
if,
blind
drunk,
they
run
into
a
pedestrian
at
noon,
because
the
jury
will
infer
purpose,
but
does
not
convict
them
of
first
degree
murder
if,
blind
drunk,
they
run
into
somebody
at
3:00
in
the
morning
going
100
miles
an
hour,
because
absent
drunkenness
the
jury
will
infer
negligence,
so
those
cases
are
treated
differently.
maybe
it's
irrational,
maybe
it
isn't,
but
i
want
to
be
clear
about
what
i
think
they're
saying
the
justification
is,
and
now
that's
what
i
want
you
to
reply
to.
what's
wrong
with
their
justification?
unknown
speaker
ms.
german,
do
i
understand
that
the
argument
you're
making
is,
the
state
could
make
this
conduct
as
the
same
degree
of
culpability
as
now,
so
this
case
is
about
form,
that
it
didn't
do
it
in
the
right
form,
but
they
could
accomplish
exactly
the
same
result
through
another
statute,
or
are
you
saying
if
somebody
was
drunk
the
jury
has
got
to
be
told
that
because
it
always
goes
to
culpability?
are
we
dealing
with
pure
form,
or
is
there
some
substance
at
stake?
unknown
speaker
then
why
isn't
it
pure
form?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
think
you've
answered
my--
--they
couldn't
get--
--yes.
--this
result,
this
precise
result
in
any
other
way,
really,
could
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
are
they
both
right?
one
is
following
instructions,
and
the
other
isn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
we
read
the
instructions
as
a
whole,
and
isn't
it
clear
from
the
instruction
that
it
may
not
be
taken
into
account
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
one
juror
is
following
the
instructions
and
the
other
juror
isn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you've
made
an
argument
for...
perhaps
for
jury
difficulty
in
following
the
instruction.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
think
you've
made
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
two
jurors
can
each
follow
the
instruction
and
come
out
differently
as
in
your
example.
actually,
the
juror
could
say,
i
don't
believe
he
was
aware
because
he
was
drunk.
that...
the
juror
could
say
that
and
be
following
the
instructions
so
long
as
the
reason...
the
reason
he
thinks
he
wasn't
aware
is
something
more
than
simply
knowing
he
had
drunk
three
bottles
of
bourbon
immediately
before
the
event.
there
has
to
be
some
external
evidence
that
he
was
not
aware,
and
the
jury...
the
juror
could
see
that
external
evidence,
let's
say
a
videotape,
and
say,
he
wasn't
aware.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
reason
i
think
he
wasn't
aware
is
i
think
he
was
drunk,
but
it's
some
evidence
other
than
the
mere
evidence
of
the
drunkenness
that
convinces
the
juror
of
that
unawareness.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
terribly
irrational.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
the
burden's
on
the
state
to
prove
awareness.
unknown
speaker
so
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
of
awareness,
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
but
there
wasn't
a
whole
series
of
things
that
were
recited
in
the
brief,
taking
the
gun
out
of
the
glove
compartment--
unknown
speaker
--aiming
squarely--
unknown
speaker
--not
using
any...
doing
it
very
efficiently.
unknown
speaker
certainly
if
you're
a
montana
trial
judge
and
this
is
on
the
books,
and
you're
asked
to
give...
you
give
that
instruction,
don't
you?
you
don't
say,
well,
you...
to
the
state,
well,
you've
got
plenty
of
evidence,
so
much
evidence
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
jury
considering
evidence
that
the
statute
says
you
couldn't
consider.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's...
if
it's
a
very
debatable
instruction
you
might
not
ask
for
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
when
you
have
a
statute
on
the
books
that
says,
this
is...
the
jury
may
not
consider
this,
the
state
would
normally
certainly
ask
for
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
state
prohibits
the
commission
of
an
act
that
is
reckless,
where
the
actor
is
aware
of
the
risk,
and
then
it
has
a
further
statute
that
says
drunkenness
does
not
negate
recklessness,
would
that
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
that's
one
reason
i
asked.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking,
suppose
you
did?
unknown
speaker
you
must
be...
the
actor
must
be
aware
of
the
risk.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
have
to
answer
that,
and
i...
that
way,
and
that
means
that
under
your
formulation
i
think
the
model
penal
code
is
also
unconstitutional,
and
i'm
quite
troubled
by
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
state
is
saying
here
is
that
in
most
cases
the
jury
can
find
awareness,
knowledge,
conscious
purpose,
quite
without
regard
to
drunkenness,
and
that
we
don't
want
drunkenness
to
intervene
as
an
excuse,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
plausible
and
a
permissible
and
a
rational
theory.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
say
sure,
then
if
you
agree
with
that,
then
you
lose,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand,
really,
the
distinction
between
the
affirmative
defense--
unknown
speaker
--and,
i
can
disprove
intent
by
showing
i
was
dead
drunk.
are
you...
you
say
that
those
two
are
discrete,
and
maybe
in
the
abstract
i
can
think
of
them
that
way,
but
in
concrete
i
can't,
if
you're
using
the
drunkenness
to
show
he
could
not
have
formed
the
mental
intent
necessary
to
be
deliberate.
unknown
speaker
isn't
in
this
case...
i
would
have
thought
that
a
state
might
have
a
law
which
says,
if
you
do
this
with
purpose
or
knowledge,
you're
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
but
if
you
do
it
with
purpose
and
knowledge
and
are
voluntarily
intoxicated
at
the
time
to
a
serious
degree,
you're
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
unknown
speaker
it
would
then
be
an
excuse,
a
defense.
you're
saying
that's
not
what's
at
issue
here.
montana
could
do
that,
probably,
but
that's
not
what's
at
issue
here.
what's
at
issue
here
is
how
you
prove
an
element.
all
right,
so
how
do
you...
have
you
run
across
any
authority
anywhere
which...
this
is
where
i'm
having
trouble
again.
suppose
congress
passed
a
law
which
said,
robbery
of
a
federally
insured
bank
is
a
crime.
they
might
also
pass
a
law
which
said,
robbery
of
any
bank
in
commerce
is
a
crime.
suppose
they
pass
the
first
and
say,
but
you're
not
allowed
to
deny
that
it's
a
federally
insured
bank.
are
those
two
statutes
the
equivalent?
is
there
any
authority...
i'm
not
asking
you
to
think
of
the
answer
to
that
right
now.
i
just
want
to
know
if
it
triggers
any
bell
in
what
you've
looked
up
and
that
makes
any
difference
at
all
whether
they
do
it
the
one
way
rather
than
the
other.
it's
somewhat
misleading
the
first
way.
people
might
not
know
what
they've
done.
it
could
create
irrational
distinctions
the
first
way.
does
it
ring
any
bell?
no.
unknown
speaker
ms.
german,
do
i
take
it
that
this
is
not...
your
argument
is
not
special
to
homicide.
it
would
be
any
intentional--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
just
ask
you
a
particular
question
that
occurred
to
me,
and
i
may
be
totally
off-track.
suppose
there's
an
aggravated
assault,
assault
with
intent
to
commit
grave
bodily
harm,
and
the
defendant,
who
happens
to
be
the
spouse
of
the
victim,
has
beaten
her
to
a
bloody
pulp,
but
he
says,
i
was...
i
do
this
when
i'm
drunk.
and
so
you
have
two
cases,
one
with
someone
who
does
it
when
he's
drunk,
the
other
who's
cold
sober.
can
the
state
say,
we're
not
going
to
treat
those
two
differently,
or
must
the
batterer
who
does
it
when
he's
drunk
be
able
to
say
to
the
jury,
i
was
drunk,
so
that
should
be
mitigating?
unknown
speaker
but
it
says
that
the
intent,
i
have
to
show
intent
to...
and
says,
i
didn't
want
to
hurt
her
at
all.
it's
just
that
i
go
crazy
when
i
get
drunk.
unknown
speaker
can
a
state
say
in
justice
ginsburg's
second
hypothesis,
you
may
not
introduce
evidence
of
drunkenness?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
you
have
to
intentionally
and
purposefully
assault...
act
with
an
intent
and
a
conscious
purpose
to
injure
the
victim?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
drunkenness,
showing
drunkenness
just
showing
a
prior...
just
showing
prior
behavior?
if
you
can
show
that
the
person
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing,
whatever
the
reason,
drunkenness
or
not,
you
get
off.
drunkenness
is
simply,
you
prove
that
the
person
drank
three
bottles
sometime
ago,
and
excluding
that
evidence
of
prior
conduct,
i
don't
see
why
that's
any
different
from
rape
shield
laws
which
exist
in
many
states,
where,
you
know,
in
a
rape
case
the
defendant
is
not...
not
able
to
introduce
evidence
that
the
alleged
victim
was
sexually
promiscuous.
unknown
speaker
they
just
say,
we're
not
going
to
allow
that
in.
unknown
speaker
the
question
before
us
is
whether
there
was
a
rape
or
not,
and
you
can
prove
it
a
lot
of
ways,
but
we're
not
going
to
let
this
prior
history
come
in,
and
it's
the
same
thing
with
this
drunkenness
statute,
it
seems
to
me.
the
question
before
is
whether
it
was
knowing,
and
we're
not
going
to
let
the
prior
history
of
drinking
the
booze
come
into
the
question.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
drunkenness
isn't
an
element
of
the
crime
here,
any
more
than--
unknown
speaker
--which
suggests
that
in
fact
the
state
really
cannot
get
the
results
that
it's
trying
to
get
here
except
by
doing
what
it's
doing.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this.
we
have
been
assuming...
i
think
most
of
our
questions
and
most
of
the
answers
have
been
assuming
that
if
there
is
something
irrational
about
what's
going
on
it's
because
the
fact
of
the
intoxication
goes
to
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
the
purpose
or
the
awareness,
and
we've
sort
of
left
our
analysis
there.
isn't
the
policy
of
the
statute
based
on
something
different,
and
that
difference
is,
two
people,
one
drunk,
one
sober
can
be
aware,
but
one
is
not
inhibited
in
his
action,
the
drunk
one,
the
sober
one
is,
and
the
state
is
saying
that
the
lack
of
inhibition
as
a
result
of
voluntary
intoxication
should
not
be
an
excuse.
that
is
not
irrational
in
the
sense
of
going
to
the
proof
of
awareness
or
purpose,
and
it
is
rational
in
saying
there
are
certain
acts
which
remove
the
capacity
to
inhibit
behavior,
and
they
should
not
be
taken
as
an
excuse.
isn't
that
the
justification?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
has
to
prove
that.
unknown
speaker
the
state
has
to
prove
that.
unknown
speaker
so
i
think
i
may
assume
that
hypothesis.
if
the
person
is,
in
one
example,
blind
drunk
on
the
floor,
the
state
isn't
going
to
be
able
to
prove
it,
but
in
the
state
has
proven
it--
unknown
speaker
--pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
i...
your
time
has
expired,
ms.--
general
mazurek,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mazurek,
i
was
curious
about
one
thing
in
montana.
how
do
they
treat
being
high
on
drugs
as
distinguished
from
alcohol?
unknown
speaker
so
it
includes--
