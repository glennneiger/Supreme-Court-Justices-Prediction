mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
souter,
the
answer
is
on
page
2
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
state,
filed
by
the
state.
i
don't
think
that
the
general
had
an
opportunity
to
get
back
to
your
question,
but
the
answer
is
that
it
is
a
changed
purpose
concept.
it
is
not
the
ordinary
purpose
as
one
would
think--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
as
i
read
their
reply
brief--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--as
i
understood
the
argument
here,
i
didn't
think
that
the
general
got
to
get
back
to
that
question
because
he
was
answering
the
other
part
of
your
question,
but
i
don't
understand
them--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--to
have
changed
their
view.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
justice
souter,
and
the
reason
is
this.
the
thing
that
the
state
court
did
wrong
in
the
first
place
was
to
use
winship
and
that
line
of
cases
as
the
first
step
in
the
analysis,
rather
than
the
last
step
of
the
analysis.
in
the
usual
case
we
give
to
the
states
the
power
to
determine
what
are
the
elements
of
criminal
responsibility,
and
based
on
the
elements
as
they
fashion
them,
then
hold
them
to
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
here,
the
state
court
never
really
got
to
the
question
of
whether
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
state
law,
because
it
simply
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that,
to
the
extent
that
there
had
been
one,
it
was
barred
by
winship.
in
our
view
that
was,
in
a
sense,
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse,
because
it
was
using
a
test
from
these
case...
from
this
court's
cases
that
is
directed
at
the
last
step
of
the
analysis
as
the
first
step,
and
what
it
should
have
done
to
start
with
the
analysis
rightly
was
to
recognize
that
the
proper
test
was
whether
this
change
in
the
substantive
conception
of
criminal
liability
was
consistent
with
the
history
and
tradition
of
our
people,
which
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
they
do,
but
what
they
do
is
that
they
have
a
conception
of
knowledge
and
purpose
from
which
the
effects
of
voluntary
intoxication
have
been
extracted,
which
is
not
all
that
different
from
how
the
common
law
dealt
with
the
concept
of
malice
aforethought.
one
could
equally
well
have
said
that
at
common
law
being
completely
intoxicated
was
as
relevant
in
a
logical
sense
to
whether
one
could
form
malice
aforethought.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
let
me
indicate
two
possible
points.
the
first
point
is
that
evidence
of
intoxication
really
goes
not
so
much
to
intent
but
to
capacity
to
form
intent
and,
in
that
sense,
it
is
a
sort
of
evidence
that
is
not
about
the
defendant
himself
but
about
hypothetical
third
party.
it
says,
in
effect,
given
certain
medical
data
most
people
would
do
x.
it
doesn't
really
say
anything
about
the
specific
person,
other
than
by
inference
that
he
may
be
in
the
norm.
the
second
point
is
that
a
legislature
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
effects
of
voluntary
intoxication
are
not
relevant
to
the
law's
conception
of
intent,
in
the
sense
that
in
the
ordinary
case
the
effect
is
to
remove
inhibitions.
it
doesn't
keep
people
from
being
able
to
think
and
choose,
and
to
say
that
you're
going
to
explain,
in
a
way,
how
intoxication
made
it
difficult
to
invoke
behavioral
controls
or
to
grasp
how
grave
the
conduct
was
is
one
way
of
saying
why
the
intent
was
there
but
not
really
saying
that
it
wasn't.
in
a
way--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
he
can
use
the
intoxication
to
explain
his
current
inability
to
have
a
complete
memory.
what
he
is
not
allowed
to
do
is
to
tell
the
jury
that
because
most
people
who
have
had
a
similar
number
of
drinks
would
have
been
intoxicated
and
impaired,
that
his
own
intent
was
lacking.
now,
let
me
hasten
to
say
that
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
gets
to
prove
that
he
is
guilty
of
the
crime
merely
because
he
was
drunk.
there
may
be
cases,
as
one
was
given
from
the
bench,
where
the
person
has
completely
passed
out
and
he
is
incapable
of
committing
the
act.
at
the
same
time,
in
a
case
like
this
the
state
can
point
to
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
one
person,
notwithstanding
anything
that
might
have
flown
under
another
rule
of
law
from
his
intoxication,
was
capable
of
knowing,
of
knowledge
and
purpose,
and
the
examples
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--oh,
but
of
course.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
he
could
have--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--absolutely.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
absolutely.
let
me
give
you
two
examples.
you
could
have
someone
who
is
shown
in
a
videotape
walking
out
of
a
bar,
and
he
is
completely
drunk,
and
he
is
shooting
wildly
in
the
air.
he
has
no
conception
of
exercising
choice
about
what
he
is
doing,
and
in
that
sort
of
a
case
the
state
would
have
a
very
tough
time
showing
that
he
was
capable
of
knowledge
and
purpose.
you
have
the
same
person
who
you
happen
to
know
has
ingested
the
same
amount
of
alcohol
in
another
videotape,
and
he
is
taking
aim
at
you,
and
he
is
shooting
and
cocking
his
eye
and
saying
something
like,
i
got
you
now,
and
he
hits
you
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead.
you
could
infer
from
that,
apart
from
knowing
anything
about
intoxication,
that
he
was
capable
of
exercising
aim,
judgment,
and
that
he
had
some
knowledge
of
good
and
evil.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
i
would
not
allow
it
under
this
law
as
to
either
of
those
two
cases.
i
would
say
that
the
evidence
of
the
mental
state
should
be
inferred
from
the
circumstances
of
the
conduct,
and
that
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
no.
let
me
paint
another
picture
for
you
here--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
stevens.
based
on
the
evidence
in
this
case,
let
me
highlight
to
you
four
facts
that
i
think
are
fairly
significant.
the
first
one
is
that
earlier
in
the
day
he
had
put
the
gun
and
the
holster
in
the
glove
compartment,
and
that
therefore
he
had
to
take
it
out
of
there,
which
indicates
some
exercise
of
design.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
i
am...
i
am
explaining
to
you
how,
in
an
ordinary
case,
you
can
have
a
very
compelling
case
of
intent
and
judgment.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i'm
not
saying
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
is
within
their
domain
to
define
who
is
morally
culpable,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
understand--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
question,
and
the
answer
is
the
same
rational
basis
as
allows
a
guilty
person
to
go
free
whenever
the
state
cannot
muster
the
evidence,
even
though
he's
equally
guilty
as
the
person
who
goes
to
jail,
and
the
fact
is
that
many
days
the
state
cannot
muster
the
evidence
to
show
that
somebody
is
guilty
when,
in
fact,
he
is
and
he
goes
free,
and
that
is
not
rational
at
some
level,
but
that's
not
a
general
impeachment
of
our
criminal
laws.
