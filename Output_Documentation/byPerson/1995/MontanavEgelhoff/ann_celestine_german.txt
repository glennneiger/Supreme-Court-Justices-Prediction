ms.

german.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
montana
supreme
court
has
authoritatively
construed
the
montana
law
in
this
case.
this
instruction
prevented
the
consideration
by
the
jury,
as
it
decided
whether
or
not
there
was
reasonable
doubt
as
to
james
egelhoff's
acting
purposely
or
knowingly,
of
evidence
that,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
negated
those
elements.
the
jury's
task
is
to
ascertain
the
truth.
it
cannot
do
that
if
relevant
evidence
going
to
the
proof
of
an
element
of
the
charged
offense
is
excluded
from
the
deliberations
of
the
jury,
the
considerations
by
the
jury
during
its
deliberations.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes,
i
agree
with
you.
the
montana
supreme
court
in
its
decision
in
egelhoff
did
not
find
montana
rule
403,
the
rule
of
evidence
that
allows
the
court
to
exclude
otherwise
relevant
evidence,
did
not
find
that
rule
unconstitutional.
that
rule
continues
in
effect.
otherwise
relevant
evidence
can
be
excluded
because
it's
not
probative,
it's
confusing,
it's
misleading,
et
cetera.
in
this--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--a
policy--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--yes.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes.
the
montana
supreme
court
in
construing
that
this
evidence
was
relevant
to
this
particular
charge
of
deliberate
homicide
made
an
initial
determination
that
the
elements
of
this
crime
are
purpose
and
knowledge
subject
mental
state
elements.
that
was
their
first
step.
the
second
step
was
that
given
that
those
are
the
elements,
intoxication
is
relevant,
legally
relevant
because
it
tends
to
prove
a
fact,
the
probability
of
the
existence
of
a
fact
that
would
go
to
the
ultimate
determination.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
so
you
can...
you
could
affirm
the
montana
supreme
court
without
saying
that--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--i--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--i
don't
disagree
with
what
you're
saying.
what...
our
point
is
that
part
of
what
the
montana
supreme
court
did
here
was
it
not
only
construed
the
statute
of
deliberate
homicide
with
respect
to
what
the
elements
were,
it
also
construed
what
is
legally
relevant
to
those
elements
in
this
particular
case.
it
held
that
under
montana
law
intoxication
evidence
is
legally
relevant
to
the
proof
of
knowledge
or
purpose.
the
confusion
arises
where
you
get
into
the
history
of
the
use
of
intoxication
over
the
last
200
years,
which
would
be
a
different
case.
the
montana
supreme
court
didn't
look
at
that
in
determining
that
montana
state
law
relevance
is
that
this
evidence
is
relevant.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes,
and
it--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--what
i--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--the
montana
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
this
court's
precedent
on
due
process
gave
rise
to
their
conclusion
that
when
you
have
an
essential
element
of
a
crime,
in
this
case
purpose
or
knowledge,
the
jury...
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
have
a
jury
find
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
when
you
exclude
that
evidence
that
is
legally
relevant,
you
have
undermined
that
due
process
right
that
this
court
has
enunciated.
with
respect
to
the
marital
privilege--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
how
to
answer
the
question
with
respect
to
marital
privilege
on
this
particular
set
of
facts,
because
what
the
montana
supreme
court
did
here
was
very,
very
narrow.
they
said,
in
this
case,
where
a
man
who
is.36
blood
alcohol
is
charged
with
a
crime
that
requires
proof
by
the
state
of
subjective
mental
state,
intoxication
is
relevant,
and
to
exclude
it--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--well,
no,
and
in
fact
the
opinion,
if
it's
affirmed,
would
have
the
effect
of
overturning
that
statute,
the
part
of
the
statute
that
was
amended
in
1987,
but
how
they
arrive
at
their
conclusion
was
based
on
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
and
the
court...
i
could...
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
to
find
it,
but
the
court
in
their
opinion
specifically
said,
here
we
have
a
man
who
is.36,
the
jury
wasn't
entitled
to
consider
it.
and
i
want
to
point
something
out.
this
evidence
was
not
excluded
from
the
jury.
this
evidence
was
brought
in
by
the
state.
it
was
introduced
by
the
state
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
in
their
opening
statement,
the
evidence
was
collected,
they
produced
the
evidence
of
it,
they
proved
to
the
jury
that
he
was.33
blood
alcohol,
they
proved
that
he
was
a
violent
drunk,
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
trial
they
said
to
the
jury,
now,
with
respect
to
that
intoxication
evidence,
put
a
sack
on
your
head,
go
in
the
jury
room,
and
don't
consider
it,
but
yet
you've
got
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
acted
purposely,
which
requires
subjective
mental
state--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--yes.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes,
but
had
the
state
not
introduced
it
in
their
own
case-in-chief,
i
think
the
situation
might
have
been
a
little
different.
one
of
the
things
that
happened--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--no,
and
the
statute
that
existed
prior
to
1985,
or
to
'87,
was
not
a
mandatory
statute.
it
didn't
say
the
jury
must
consider
intoxication.
it
said
that
the
jury
may
consider
intoxication.
what
happened
in
'87
is
the
jury
was
precluded
from
considering
it
for
any
purpose,
so
when
we
get
into
egelhoff,
certainly
we
could
have
presented
and
we
did
present
the
evidence
to
prove
that
he
was
physically
incapable
of
acting,
but
the
state
introduced
it
to
prove
that
he
was
a
violent
drunk
who
killed
with
no
motive.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
well,
what's
wrong
with
it
is
not
that
they
can't
do
that.
they
can't
do
it
this
way.
if
they
want
to
do
it
they
can...
the
montana
legislature
has
the
capacity
to
pass
a
statute
that
specifically
says,
there
is
a
crime
known
as
intoxicated
homicide,
and
for
that
crime
we
are
not
going
to
require
a
subjective
mental--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--well,
i'm
not...
again,
i
can't
get
away
from
this.
the
montana
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
statute
that
is...
that
mr.
egelhoff
was
charged
with
here
as
requiring
proof
of
the
specific
mental
states,
and
you
can't
do
that
if
you
don't
allow
the
evidence
of
intoxication
to
come
in
for
the
jury
to
consider
it.
the
jury
does
not
have
all
of
the
relevant
evidence
that
they
need,
and
in
the
montana
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
statutes,
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
is
bound
by
that
interpretation.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
well,
it's
not
pure
form,
and
i
guess
in
response
to
your
first...
the
first
proposition,
there
is
nothing
in
the
montana
supreme
court's
opinion
here
that
prohibit's
the
jury,
or
the
legislature
from
doing
what
you
suggest.
now,
they
could
write
a
statute
that
results
in
a
serious
penalty
being
imposed
on
a
person
who
commits
a
crime
when
drunk
without
proof
of
any
other
mental
state.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
because
in...
as
has
been
recited
by
this
court
in
fairly
recent
decisions,
even
when
a
case
exists
where
a
person
is
absolutely
guilty...
i
mean,
the
proof
beyond
them
is
overwhelming,
we
do
not
allow
the
judge
to
direct
a
verdict.
i
mean,
what
we're
doing
is
we're
saying
the
jury
is
the
one
who's
going
to
make
the--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--no,
and
you
know,
i
want
to
point
something
out
here
that
i
think
happens,
and
this
is
of
interest
to
me
because
i'm
a
trial
lawyer.
you
have
two
jurors
in
this
jury
room.
they've
both
taken
an
oath
to
follow
the
instructions.
one
of
them
says,
i
believe
that
this
man
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing.
the
lowest
form
of
mental
state...
and
i
wanted
to
correct
justice
o'connor
on
that.
we
don't
have
to
prove
purpose
and
knowledge
in
montana,
only
purpose
or
knowledge,
and
knowledge
is
a
very
low
standard.
it
just
means
awareness.
so
there's
someone
in
the
jury
room
saying,
i
don't
think
this
man
was
aware,
and...
because
he
was
drunk.
another
juror
said,
i've
taken
an
oath
to
follow
these
instructions,
and
this
instruction
said,
i
can't
take
intoxication
into
account.
they're
both
right,
and
they
are
mutually
contradictory
to
one
another.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes.
one
is
following
the
instruction
that
says
i
cannot
take
intoxication
into
account
when
determining
the
mental
state,
the
other
one's
saying,
i
don't
think
he
was
aware.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
that's
right.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
well,
the
other
juror,
the
one
who's
saying
i'm
following
the
instruction
that
says
we
can't
take
it
into
account,
may
very
well
not
believe
he
was
aware,
so
what
you're
doing
is
undermining
the
truth
of
the
verdict.
he
may
not
believe...
i
don't
believe
he
was
aware,
but
i
can't
take
that--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--mm-hmm.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
right.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
well,
what
i'm
suggesting,
i'm
suggesting
the
scenario
where
that
isn't
there.
there
isn't
that
other
evidence.
we
don't
have
a
videctape.
we've
got
mr.
egelhoff
out
there
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
in
the
middle
of
nowhere,
in
the
dark,
and
no
one
sees
a
thing.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
so
the
only
evidence
they
have
of
mental
state
is
entirely
circumstantial
based
on
what
happened
after
the
fact.
so
they're
sitting
there
and
they're
going,
well,
boy,
we
just
don't
think
he
was
aware,
given
the
fact
that
he
was
found
to
be
unconscious...
the
first
people
on
the
scene
found
him
to
be
unconscious,
et
cetera.
that
evidence
is
in
the
record.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
that's
right.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
well,
the
evidence
of
awareness
i'm
sure
in
this
case
was
the
state's
contention
that
he
pulled
the
trigger.
you
wouldn't
do
that
when
you're
unaware,
i
guess,
asleep,
but--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--exactly,
and--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--yes.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
everything
that
the
state
has
recited
in
their
brief,
and
the
montana
supreme
court
in
fact
recited
in
its
opinion,
go
to
show
that
the
state
had
ample
evidence.
they
didn't
need
this
instruction.
they
could
still
go
to
the
jury
and
say,
hey,
we...
you
know,
you
can
take
intoxication
into
account
here,
or
we
don't
give
an
instruction
at
all
with
respect
to
it.
we've
got
evidence
that
he
committed
this
crime.
based...
you
know,
go
ahead
and
take
into
account
all
of
the
evidence.
don't
exclude
any,
you
know--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--i
don't
know
that
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
in
this
case
not
giving
that
instruction...
we
objected
to
the
giving
of
the
instruction
on
a
couple
of
grounds,
one
of...
the
one
that
we're
here
today,
that
it
wasn't
the
state's
burden
to
prove
the
mental
state
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
not
giving
the
instruction
doesn't
direct
the
jury
one
way
or
the
other
and,
for
instance,
in
the
fisher
case
that
was
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
in
their
brief,
that's
what
happened.
it
was
the
failure
to
give
an
instruction,
rather
than
the
giving
of
instruction
that
was
the
complaint.
if
you
get
to
the
end
of
your
case
as
the
state
and
you
feel
that
you've
proved
purpose
or
knowledge,
and
again,
it's
a
very
low
standard
in
montana,
awareness,
awareness
of
your
conduct,
awareness
that
your
conduct
has
a
result,
you
don't
need
this
further
instruction
to
the
jury
saying
you
can't
take
voluntary
intoxication
into
account.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
well,
it
happened
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
i
don't
know
of
very
many
others,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
instances
in
montana,
for
100
years,
montana
allowed
the
evidence
of
intoxication
on
the
issue
of
mental
state,
and
there
is
not...
there
are
no
reported
cases,
or
there
were
no
evidence
of
any
case
of
a
person
who
was
acquitted
because
of
it.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
well,
that's
the
model
penal
code
formulation.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes,
and
we
don't
have
that
in
montana.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes.
the
model
penal
code
formulation
was
concededly
arbitrary.
however,
i
would
point
out
that
i
think
that
at
some
point
evidence
of
intoxication
when
you're
charging
an
objective
mental
state...
and
i
think
your
question
posited
a
subjective
mental
state.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
okay.
i
think
again
when
you've
got
an
awareness
question
that
the
jury
has
to
find
that
evidence
of
intoxication
might
very
well
be
required
to
be
allowed
in
that
case,
but
it
would
be
unconstitutional--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--sure,
and
i
would
point
out
here
that
the
montana
supreme
court's
interpretation
of--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--well,
what
i
was
going
to
want
to
say
is
that
what
the
montana
supreme
court
said
here
was
that
it's
not
an
excuse.
they
said
the
word
excuse,
i.e.,
defense,
is
not
what
we're
doing.
we're
not
allowing
the
word,
exculpate,
excuse,
defend...
we're
not
allowing
an
intoxicated
defendant
to
come
in
and
say,
i
am
not
criminally
responsible,
that
we
might
say,
for
instance,
to
somebody
who
has
some
other
infirmity.
all
we're
saying
is
that,
as
this
court
has
held
in
other
cases,
with
respect
to
the
proof
of
this
mental
state,
i
want
to
be
able
to
say
to
the
jury,
you've
got
to
consider
whether
or
not
i
in
fact
was
aware,
given
my
level
of
intoxication,
and
if...
and
if
this
court's
rules
or
precedent
on
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
all
essential
elements
is
to
be
applied
to
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
the
montana
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
their
statute
in
the
application
of
these
rules,
these
precedents
has
to
be
affirmed.
if
you
want
to
go
further--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--okay.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
okay,
justice
ginsburg,
i'll
give
you
an
example
of
the
practical
effect.
when
you're
trying
a
case,
in
a
criminal
case
to
the
jury,
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
uphold
with
the
evidence,
and
in
martin
v.
ohio
i
think
in
fact
this
language
was
used,
that
the
state
survives
the
motion
to
acquit
at
the
end
of
the
state's
case.
all
that
time
what
you're
doing,
the
state
has
the
burden
to
prove
the
elements
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
defense
is
constantly
raising
doubts,
constantly
trying
to
raise
reasonable
doubt,
constantly,
with
respect
to
every
piece
of
evidence
that
comes
in.
at
the
end
of
the
state's
case,
the
defendant
sits
down
and
said,
i
have
no
evidence
to
present.
the
burden's
on
the
state,
it's
got
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
don't
have
any
burden.
i'm
sitting
here
waiting
for
a
verdict.
in
that
case,
all
you've
done,
really,
is
negate
the
mental
state.
that's
all
you've
really
done,
is
tried
to
negate
the
mental
state.
if,
however,
they
prove
the
awareness,
then
the
burden
very
permissibly,
according
to
this
court's
cases,
can
shift
to
the
defendant
to
come
forward
and
try
to
prove
an
affirmative
defense
why
the
state's
proof
of
the
case
up
to
that
point,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
ought
not
to
result
in
a
guilty
verdict,
and
that's
how
the
affirmative
defense
comes
in.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes.
ms.
ann
celestine

well,
it
creates
irrational
distinctions,
and
i
hate
to
keep
coming
back
to
this,
but
what
it
seems
to
me
this
court's
inquiry
has
to
be
is
not...
this
court
is
not
for
the
first
time
approaching
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute.
the
montana
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
statute,
and
its
interpretation
ends,
these
are
the
elements,
this
evidence
is
relevant,
therefore
under
winship
and
sandstrom
and
martin
and
chambers
and
the
other
precedents
we've
cited
the
defendant's
entitled
to
have
that
evidence
considered
by
the
jury.
so
it
gets
down
to
a
question
of
the
montana
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
state
law.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
yes.
i
wanted
to
point
something--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--the
batterer
can
say
that.
the
jury
isn't
going
to
accept
it,
and
that's
the
nub
of
this
case.
this
hasn't
to
do
with
directed--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--and
if
i
were
a
prosecutor
i
would
argue
that
to
the
jury.
i
would
say,
this
man
knew
that
when
he
got
drunk
he
commits
violent
acts,
so
in
fact
he
is
culpable
of
the...
you
can't
say
that
he
didn't
intend
to
do
what
he
was
doing.
because
what
you're
really
doing
in
a...
when
you're
asking
a
jury
to
find
a
mental
state,
you're
asking
them
to
go
in
the
jury
room
and
consider
all
of
the
evidence
and
determine
whether
or
not
they
think
the
person
know
what--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--if...
if
the
element
of
the
offense...
the
montana
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
is
that
if
the
elements
of
the
offense
make
that
evidence
relevant,
then
you
have
to
allow
it.
i
think
that
has
to
be
determined
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
it
may
well
be--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--that
the
mental
state
for
aggravated
assault
would
not
make
it
relevant.
in
homicide,
deliberate
homicide,
the
montana
supreme
court--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--there's
a...
the
mental
state
requirement
is
purposefully
or
knowingly.
knowingly
is,
as
i
say,
a
very
low
standard.
all
you
have
to
show
is
awareness,
the
fact
that
the
person
was
aware
of
what
he
was
doing.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
the
evidence--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--the
evidence
that--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--let
me
draw
an
example.
if
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
of
rape
were
the
past
sexual
conduct
of
the
rape
victim,
then
i
don't
know
that
the
rape
shield
law
could
stand
constitutional
challenge.
the
rape
shield
law
withstands
constitutional
challenge
because
there's
no...
it's
not
caused...
there's
no
causal
nexus
between
the
rape
victim's
prior
conduct--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--and
this
man's
intent.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
right,
and
what
was
excluded
here
from
consideration
by
the
jury
was
not
that
the
man
drank
8
hours
before,
it
was
at
the
time
that
the
offenses
were
committed
his
blood
alcohol
level
was.36.
and
i
wanted
to
respond
to
something
that
justice
souter
said,
because
i
think
this
is
important.
justice
souter
hypothesized
in
the
petitioner's
case
a
statute
that
said
that
you
could
punish
someone
for
being
drunk
other
than
driving
a...
for
committing
a
homicide
other
than
when
driving
a
car
to
preserve
the
negligent
homicide
case.
in
fact,
what
this
statute
has
done
in
montana
is
eliminate
the
negligent
homicide,
because
if
you
go
in
and
you
try
to
prove
drunken
vehicular
homicide
in
montana,
and
this
statute
is
allowed...
this
instruction
is
given
to
the
jury,
the
jury
can't
consider
it.
they
have
to
bring
hack
a
deliberate
homicide
verdict.
they
can't
consider
intoxication
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
person
in
fact
was
negligent,
which
is
an
objective
mental
state,
as
compared
to
purposeful
or
knowing,
which
is
the
subjective
mental
state.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
no,
which
suggests
that
the
state
has
to
be
very
careful
about
the
way
it
defines
the
element
of
offenses.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
well,
it's
a
justification,
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
how
you
framed
your
hypothesis,
or
your
analysis.
you
started
out
by
saying
you
have
two
people
who
are
aware,
one
who's
drunk
and
one
who's
sober.
in
fact,
if--
ms.
ann
celestine
german
--the
person
is
not
aware.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
mm-hmm.
ms.
ann
celestine
german
why
not?
ms.
ann
celestine
german
i
mean...
excuse
me.
