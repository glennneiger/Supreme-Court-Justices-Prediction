mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
mazurek,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
few
matters
are
so
troubling
to
modern
society
as
the
vexing
correlation
between
intoxication
and
criminal
behavior.
at
common
law,
a
person
who
committed
a
violent
act
could
not
rely
on
his
voluntarily
intoxicated
condition
to
exculpate
his
conduct.
in
1987,
the
montana
legislature,
exercising
the
power
traditionally
left
to
the
states
to
prevent
and
deal
with
crime,
returned
to
that
common
law
tradition.
it
changed
its
substantive
criminal
law
by
enacting
a
statute
which
precludes
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
from
relying
upon
evidence
of
his
own
voluntary
intoxication
from
escaping
personal
responsibility
for
his
actions
which
ensued.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
mr.
chief
justice,
the
supreme
court
of
montana
did
not
address
that
issue.
the
supreme...
that
issue
was
raised
by
the
state
in
its
supplemental
brief
to
the
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court's
analysis
skipped
over
the
fact
that
the
legislature
had
passed
the
statute,
or
changed
the
statute
from
its
former
provision,
did
not
analyze
the...
or
interpret
the
statute,
rather,
proceeded
directly
to
the
due
process
analysis.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
justice
o'connor,
that's
true,
the
statute
requires
the
defendant...
requires
the
state
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
acted
purposely
and
knowingly--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--yes,
and
the
state--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
the
state
supreme
court
indicated
in
its
opinion
that
it
went
beyond...
went...
skipped
over
the
analysis
of
the
statute
and
held
that
the
defendant
was...
essentially
the
state's
burden
was
lessened,
which...
with
which
we
disagree,
or
that
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
the
right
to
introduce
all
relevant
evidence.
both
of
those
determinations
were
based
on
federal
constitutional
principles.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
agree,
and
we
agree--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--the
evidence
of...
that
the
defendant
was
passed
out,
was
asleep,
would
be
admissible
for
that
purpose.
it
would
not
be
admissible
for
determining
his
mental
state,
whether
he
acted
purposely
or
knowingly
as
the
example
in
the
respondent's
amicus
brief
suggests.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
it...
to
the
mental
state
element,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
no,
it
would
not.
it
would
go
more
likely
to...
it
would...
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
unconscious
would
tend
to
show
that
he
would...
may
have
been
physically
unable
to
commit
the
act.
in
fact,
that's
what
this
defendant
raised
the
issue
of
voluntary
intoxication
for,
to
say--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--yes,
your
honor.
under
montana
law
a
defendant
can...
we
do
not
call
it
insanity.
we
call
it
mental
disease
or
defect.
a
defendant
may
negate
the
purposely
or
knowingly
element
by
proof
of
mental
disease
or
defect,
but
that
is
a
much
different
situation
than
what
we
have
here.
there
was
strong--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--support
for
that
tradition--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--no,
your...
justice
stevens,
we
believe
that's
clearly
excluded
under
the
statute,
because
it
would
not
involve
knowing
consumption
of
the
alcohol.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
he
could
rely
on
such
evidence
to
show
that
he
did
not
knowingly
introduce
the
alcohol,
and
that
would
excuse
his
conduct,
yes.
but
if
i
may--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--your
honor,
justice
kennedy,
where
the
intoxication
is
voluntary,
no,
it
cannot.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
relevant--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--to
the
issue
of
mental
state,
and
that
is
based--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--your
honor--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--but
your
honor,
what
we're...
the
distinction
we're
drawing
here
is
where
the
intoxication
is
involuntary
the
legislature
in
the
exercise
of
its
prerogative
and
in...
consistent
with
common
law
principles
has
determined
that
a
person
ought
not
to
be
able
to
exculpate
himself
from
his
conduct
undertaken
after
he
has
voluntarily
ingested
the
intoxicating
substance.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
it
could
be
a
factor,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
it
goes
to
case--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--it--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--no.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
no.
no,
we're--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--it--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--we
concede
that--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
yes,
we
do
agree
that
it
could
be
logically
relevant,
and
that's
the
very
point
of
our
argument.
it's
the
distinction
that
the
state
of
montana
in
the
exercise
of
the
authority
traditionally
left
to
the
states
to
define
and
deal
with
crime
to
make
the
decision
under...
which
we
think
is
allowed
under
the
due
process
clause,
and
that's
why
the
montana
supreme
court's
decision
is
wrong.
we
have
made
the
evidence
legally
irrelevant,
and
have
done
so
by
express
enactment
of
the
legislature,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
common
law
tradition.
it's
based
on
sound
reasons
of
public
policy.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
we
agree--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--they
did
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
that's...
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
we...
but
it's
important
that...
the
state
does
not
shy
from
its
burden
in
this
instance
of
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
as
we
believe
the
evidence
showed
in
this
case,
that
this
defendant
acted
with
purpose
or
knowledge.
as
in
any
other
criminal
case,
that
determination
will
be
made
by
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
commission
of
the
crime,
and
even
though
a
person--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--yes.
it
may
be
logically
relevant--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--but
it
is
not
legally
relevant.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
we
would...
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
as
broad
a
right
to
introduce
all
relevant
evidence
as
the
montana
supreme
court
suggests.
i
think
this
court
has
looked
at...
the
cases
on
which
the
state
court
relied
and
on
which
respondent
relies,
such
as
chambers
and
crane,
in
those
instances,
the
evidence
being
offered
by
the
defendant
was,
in
fact,
exculpatory
under
state
law.
the
circumstances
surrounding
a
confession,
or
procedural
rules,
were
deemed
arbitrary
in
the
chambers
case
to...
and
prevented
the
defendant
from
bringing
in
evidence
that
another
individual
had
confessed
to
those
crimes.
in
those
instances,
the
evidence
which
was
sought
to
be
introduced
was
legally
relevant
under
state
law
by
the
state's...
legislature's
determination
it
is
not
legally
relevant
in
montana,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
common
law
traditions,
and
based
on
valid
public
policy
reasons
the
correlation
between--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--we
could
not.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
the
justification,
your
honor,
for
that
position
is
first
and
foremost
the
tradition
of
the
common
law,
which
denied
any
exculpatory
value
and,
in
fact,
there
is
some
evidence
that
intoxication
was
considered
an
aggravating
factor.
and
the
example
i
guess
i
would
give
in
this
case
is
the
facts
that...
on
which
purpose
and
knowledge
could
have
been
inferred
by
the
jury;
the
fact
that
mr.
egelhoff,
with
his
own
pistol,
which
had
previously
been
in
the
glove
compartment,
placed
two
well-placed
shots
from
a
pistol
into
the
heads
of
the
two
victims,
he
attempted
to
evade
detection
after...
twice.
once,
a
physician
who
was
attempting
to
provide
assistance,
he
spoke
with
the...
the
physician
was
so
scared
he
left
the
scene.
at
the
hospital
he
kicked
a
camera
from
a...
very
deliberately
kicked
a
camera
out
of
the
defendant's...
or,
excuse
me,
a
detective's
hands.
all
of
that
would...
or,
those
are
logical
to
show
that
this
defendant
acted
with
purpose
or
knowledge,
again
directing
the
court
to
the
state's
definition
of
those...
of
purposely
and
knowingly.
he
must
be
aware
of
his
conduct
or
aware
that
there
exists
a
high
probability.
all
of
the
facts
in
this
would
tend
to
indicate
that
this
was
a
deliberate
shooting
of
these
two
people,
a
person
who,
even
though
he
may
have
been
intoxicated,
and
we
don't
know--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
comment
in
the
decision
that
the
instruction
may...
might
have...
a
jury
may
have
been
misled
into
believing
that
the
state's
burden
had
been
reduced.
we
don't
think
the
state...
the
state's
burden
was
not
reduced.
it
still
had
the
burden
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
defendant
acted
purposefully
and
knowingly.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
again
for
the
very
valid
and
historical
reasons
we
have
offered
in
support
of
that
conclusion
by
the
state
legislature.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
the
state...
the
state
made
this
choice
i
think
consciously
in
this
respect:
the
statute--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--your
honor,
the...
i...
the
legislature,
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
took
a
statute
which
provided
just
the
opposite,
a
statute
which
is
codified
in
the
general
criminal
code
section
under
other
provisions
relating
to
personal--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--or
individual
responsibility.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
but--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--because
they
wanted
to
reverse
the...
what
had
been
the
treatment
under
the
model
penal
code
but--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--but
then
the
defendant
was
allowed
to--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--justice
scalia--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--i
believe
that
he
left
out
the
term
knowingly.
it
would
produce
a
strict
liability--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
we
believe
that,
believe
the
respondent
concedes
that,
that
the
state
could
have
done
that.
i
don't
think
it's
required
to
do
that.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
yes,
could
have.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
well,
we--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--your
honor,
it
is,
and
the
legislature
made
that
conscious
choice
and,
in
fact,
it
still
makes
the
evidence
available
to
show
that
the
defendant
did
not
commit
the
act
or,
as
this
defendant
did,
that--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--in
effect,
your
honor,
it
was
to...
justice
ginsburg,
it
was
to
switch
what
had
been
a
provision
which
allowed
complete
exculpation
if
intoxication
was
used
to
negate
the
mental
state
to
a
situation
where
the
person
could
not
escape
culpability--
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
--but
could
still
use
the
evidence
for
other
purposes.
and
again,
i
come
back
to
the
notion
that
the
fact
that
the
state
made
it
the
way
it
did
in
this
omnibus
manner,
by
making
it
apply
across
the
board
to
all
crimes,
that
that
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
state's
power.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
two
points,
if
i
might.
first,
i
want
to
clarify
and
ensure
that
the
court
understands
that
montana...
and
i
may
have
given
this
impression
in
response
to
justice
souter,
that
we
may
have...
we
have
not
backed
away
from
our
position
that
the
statute
which
is
in
question
here,
we
believe,
and
espouse
in
our
brief
that
it
has
conditioned
the
elements
of
purpose
and
knowledge.
it
has
taken
voluntary
intoxication
out
of
that
consideration
for
valid
public
policy
reasons.
what
i...
justice
souter,
in
my
response
to
your
question,
i
was
attempting
to
say
that
a
state
could
enact
such
a
statute.
we
do
not
believe
that
is
what
we
have
done
here.
it's
not
the
effect
of
what
we
have
done
here.
rather,
we
have
conditioned
purpose,
the
definitions
of
purpose
and
knowledge,
and
we
believe
that,
having
done
that,
we
have
offended
no
principle
enunciated
in
the
constitution.
it
is
rational.
it
does
not
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
justice
ginsburg,
being
high
on
drugs
would
have
the
same
effect.
this
statute
applies
to
the
knowing
ingestion
of
any
intoxicating
substance.
mr.
joseph
p.
mazurek
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr
chief
justice,
i'll
conclude
my
remarks.
