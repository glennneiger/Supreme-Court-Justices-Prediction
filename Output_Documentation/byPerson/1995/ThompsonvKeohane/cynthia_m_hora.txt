ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
alaska
state
trial
judge
found
the
petitioner,
carl
thompson,
was
not
in
custody
for
miranda
purposes
when
he
voluntarily
appeared
at
the
fairbanks
trooper
station
and
voluntary
answered
questions
posed
by
two
alaska
state
troopers.
the
ninth
circuit
accorded
the
state
court's
determination
on
the
custody
issue
the
presumption
of
correctness,
and
concluded
that
it
found
fair
support
in
the
record.
three
sound
policy
reasons
support
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
to
accord
the
presumption
of
correctness
to
the
miranda
custody
determination.
first,
the
custody
determination
is
extremely
fact-bound,
so
the
trial
court
is
in
the
better
position
to
decide
the
issue.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
this
is
the
type
of
application
of
law
to
the
facts
that
we
don't
want
to
be
wasting
appellate--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--time
on.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
no,
i
don't
think--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--no,
but
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
state
court's
findings
are
unreviewable
at
any
level.
they
are
still
reviewable
at
the
standard
level.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
it
is
determined
by
a
judge,
but
that...
the
fact
that
it's
determined
by
a
judge
doesn't
take
it
out
of
the...
or
doesn't
change
the
factual
nature
of
it.
the
fact
that
a
defendant
may
waive
his
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
proceed
to
a
bench
trial,
and
a
judge
may
make
the
ultimate
determination
of
guilt,
that
determination
is
entitled
to
no
less
deference
than
a
jury
verdict
would
be
simply
because
a
judge
had
made
it.
i
would
submit
that
a
lot
of
the
factors
involved
in
the
miranda
custody
determination,
it
involves
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
who
testify
in
front
of
the
trial
judge,
and
it...
and
that
demeanor
and
inflection
and
the
tone
of
voice
and
the
various
factual
findings,
and
it's
the
weight
and
the
reasonable
inferences
that
one
draws
from
that
evidence
and
those
facts
that
really
have
a
very
factual
nature,
and
are
very
dependent
on
the
demeanor
and
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
something
that
you
can't
find
from
a
written
decision
by
a
trial
court.
a
trial
court
may
he
able
to
articulate
particular
facts
that
the
trial
judge
relied
upon
in
making
the
custody
determination,
but
those
decisions
often
don't
reflect
exactly
how
much
weight
that
trial
judge
gave
to
each
of
those
types
of...
each
of
those
types
of
facts.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
i
think
it's
unclear--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
exactly
what
standard
of
review
it
did
apply.
it
did
not
refer
to
any
standard
of
review.
it
did
make
clear
in
subsequent
cases,
though,
that
in
alaska
it
will
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
or
deferential
standard
of
review
to
trial
court
determinations
of
custody.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
not
the
factual
determination.
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
legal
standard
was--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--at
the
time
thompson's
case
was
decided
it
was
unclear.
it
is
now
clearly
erroneous,
and
that
is--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--that's
correct.
i
would
be...
i'm
basically
arguing
for
the
same
standard
and
deference
that
you
would
accord
a
trial
court...
i
mean,
excuse
me,
a
trial
jury's
determination.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
perhaps
there's
some
confusion
about--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--that
is
correct.
however,
as
i
stated
before,
the
fact
that
this
factual
issue,
or
application
of
the
miranda
custody
definition
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case,
can
be
treated
as
a
factual
issue
and
subject
to
the
presumption
of
correctness,
the
legal
standard,
or
the
legal
principles
underlying
miranda
and
the
definition
of
what
miranda
custody
is
and
what
factors
are
relevant
or
irrelevant,
can
still
be
ascertained
by
a
federal
court
or
by
an
appellate
court
in
the
state
of
alaska,
and
that
is
because
you're
dealing
with
the
governing
standard.
the...
on
habeas
review,
the
thompson
court,
the
ninth
circuit,
could
have
said
the
alaska
state
trial
court
judge
did
not
apply
the
correct
legal
standard.
what...
he
relied
on
erroneous
factors,
he
didn't
consider
all
of
the
facts,
or
he...
in
which
would
be
a,
there
was
no
fair
support
in
the
record,
arguably.
there
are
ways
that
you
can
achieve
that
uniformity
and
that
appellate
review
and
that
federal
review
of
what
miranda
intends
to
protect
without
reviewing
every
single,
you
know,
factual
application.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
the
terms,
freedom
to
leave,
i
don't
think
have
that
uniquely
legal
dimension
that
the,
say,
the
voluntariness
inquiry
has.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
well,
for
one
reason,
we're
dealing
with
a
different
right.
we're
dealing
with
a
nonfundamental
right
in
miranda.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
well,
it
is
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
have
the
same
constitutional
stature
as
voluntariness
does.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
i
would
go
back
to
the
interest
we
are
trying
to
protect.
we
are
not
only
looking
at...
i
think
if
you
look
at
miller
v.
fenton,
the
decision
whether
to
affix
the
particular
label
to
an
issue
doesn't
depend
solely
on
whether
we
classify...
whether
we
think
an
issue
is
more
legal
or
more
factual
in
nature.
we
also
look
to
policy
considerations,
and
i
think
the
policy
considerations
here,
when
you're
looking
at
a
nonfundamental
right
involving...
which
is
basically
a
definition
that
is
clearly
one
that
is
a
reasonable
person
standard--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--but
subsequently
the
court
has
made
clear...
for
example,
in
wainwright
v.
witte...
that
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
that
can
be...
to
which
the
fixed,
or,
excuse
me,
the
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
can
be...
that
label
can
be
attached
and
yet
you're
going
to
treat
it
as
a
factual
issue
in
the
habeas
context
under
the
statute.
i
point,
for...
the
wainwright
v.
witte
is
an
example.
i
mean,
this
court
said,
it's
clear
here
that
what
the
trial
judge
is
doing
is
applying
the
legal
standard,
the
legal
standard
of
jury
bias,
the
witherspoon-adams
standard,
you
know,
to
the
question
of
jury
bias
here,
and
because
it's
a
predominantly
factual
inquiry,
and
because
it
is
one--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--and
the
position
of
the
state
of
alaska
is,
the
question
of
miranda
custody
is,
like
jury
bias,
a
factual
question
that--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--but
that
in
and
of
itself
is
a
judgment,
and
it's
a
judgment
that
we
entrust
to
reasonable
laypersons
every
day
in
courtrooms
cross
the
nation.
in
fact,
the
jury
in
mr.
thompson's
case--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--that
is
correct.
it's
also,
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
jury
bias
decision,
there
were
decisions
by
this
court
which
refer
to
jury
bias
as
a
mixed
question
and
nevertheless,
after
the
enactment
of
2254(d),
this
court
has
subsequently,
when
called
upon
to
address
the
issue
in
the
habeas
context,
treats
it
as
a
factual
issue.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
it
was
passed
in
1966,
the
same
year
miranda
was
decided.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
yes.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
but
this
court
has
often
treated
the
issue
of
voluntariness
differently
than
the
miranda--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--because
i
think
in
terms...
under
miller
v.
fenton,
the
court
considers
policy
determinations
in
affixing
that
label.
there
are
policy
considerations
here,
and
decisions
by
this
court
which
have
held
that
miranda
is
not
the
equivalent
of
voluntariness--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--and
shouldn't
be
treated
as
such.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
the
federal
courts
can
keep
control
of
the
definition
of
miranda,
the
legal
standard,
by
determining
whether
or
not
state
courts
apply
the
correct
legal
standard,
and
defining
what
the
standard
is.
they
do
not
need
to
keep--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--i
would
submit
that
you
would
not
lose
control
of
miranda.
you
still
decide
guiding
legal
principles
in
that.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
what
you're
dealing
with
here
is--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--i
believe
so.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
i--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--i
would...
i
don't
think
it
rises
to
the
same
level
of
voluntariness,
or
some
of
the
other
issues
that
the
court
treats
de
novo--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--that's
correct.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
the
federal
court,
though,
can
do
that
by
articulating
the
standard.
the
federal
courts,
by
having
fact-bound
decisions--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--the
court
has
already
done
that
in
miranda
cases
in
terms
of
defining
what
factors
are
relevant
and
what
factors
are
irrelevant
to
the
custody
determination.
if
you
have
a
plethora
of
decisions
simply
setting
out
facts
and
saying,
yes,
this
is
custody,
no,
this
isn't,
it's
not
going
to
be
particularly
helpful
to
the
trial
courts
because
you
know,
the
myriad
of
factual
situations
in
the
miranda
context
is
varied,
and
it's...
what
weight
to
give
particular
facts
is
going
to
depend
on
the
particularly
facts
of
the
case,
which
is
very
dependant
on
the
demeanor
and
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses.
for
example,
in
this
case,
mr.
thompson
was
told
i
think
seven
or
eight
times
that
he
was
not
under
arrest.
if
that
fact
appears
in
a
decision,
how
helpful
is
that
going
to
be
to
another
trial
judge
in
boston,
or
florida,
or
wherever,
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
person,
you
know,
taken
into
custody
in
their
jurisdiction
was
under...
or
was
entitled
to
miranda
warnings
or
not,
if
they
were
advised
two
times
that
they
were
not
under
arrest
and
they
were
free
to
leave?
i
mean,
it's
very
hard
to
discern
principles
from
just
application
of
the
facts.
you
can
set
out
the
general
factors
in
the
test,
in
the
definition,
in
clarifying
and
honing
the
definition,
but
you
don't
achieve
that
uniformity
or
those
clarification
of
guiding
principles
in
that
in
fact-bound
de
novo
review.
i
mean,
this
is
a
fact-bound
determination,
and
you
won't
achieve
that
uniformity.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
in
terms
of
this
type
of
determination,
in
terms
of
the
miranda
custody
determination,
these
very
fact-bound
determinations,
this
court
in
cooter
&
gell
v.
hartmarx
corporation,
you
know,
said,
fact-bound
determinations
are
simply
not,
you
know,
will
not
achieve
uniformity
through
appellate
review,
de
novo
or
otherwise.
i
mean,
certain
fact-bound
determinations,
there's
going
to
be
some
variance
simply
because,
you
know,
in
very,
very
close
cases,
whether
it
tips
in
favor
of
custody
or
not
in
custody
for
miranda
purposes,
a
lot
of
that
is
going
to
turn
on
the
demeanor
and
credibility
of
the
witnesses
that
the
appellate
court
just
doesn't
have
access
to
on
the
record.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
well,
you
don't--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--you
need
not
decide
that.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
you
can
take
the
step
that
i'm
asking
you
to
take
without
overruling
miller
v.
fenton.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
not
necessarily.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
you
have
the
case
of
withrow
v.
williams,
which
talks
about
the
habeas
context
and
miranda
claims,
and
this
court
determined
that
miranda
is...
you
know,
is
a
prophylactic
rule,
but
the
prophylactic
nature
of
the
rule
is
not
on
all
fours
with
mapp,
and
so
we're
not
going
to
bar
those
claims
from
federal
review
entirely.
but
the
court
also
recognized
that
they're
not
on
the
same
footing
as
voluntariness
claims,
so
what
you've
done,
you've
put
miranda--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--well,
what
you've
done
here
is
put
miranda--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--under
miller
v.
fenton,
the
court
said
that
a
lot
of
these
determinations
of
what
should
be
deemed
a
factual
issue
under
the
statute
do
involve
policy
considerations,
and
this
policy--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--i
think
you
have
the
discretion
to
determine
what
is
a
factual
issue,
and
in
determining...
or
in
affixing
the
factual
issue
label,
you
can
look
at
various
policy
considerations.
what
you
did
in
withrow
v.
williams
is,
you
put
miranda
sort
of
in
a
middle
ground.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
yes.
that's
what
miller
v.
fenton
said.
it
said
that
you
don't
look
at
an
issue
and
basically
determine...
decide
what
label
to
affix
by
deciding
this
is
a
more
legal
issue,
or
a
more
factual
issue,
and
that
you
can
also
look
at
policy
considerations--
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
--that
that
often
determines
the
scope
of
review.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
and
this
court
has
put
miranda
in
the
middle
of
fourth
amendment
claims
involving
search
and
seizure,
involuntariness
claims
involving
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
all
you
need
to
do
is
take
one
little
step
to
say,
we're
going
to
take
a
middle
ground,
which
is
appropriately
reflected
by
the
presumption
of
correctness,
and
accord
that
presumption
of
correctness
to
the
trial
court's
finding
of
fact.
ms.
cynthia
m.
hora
i
don't
think
the
last
two
are
frequently
involved.
what
is
primarily
involved
is
an
application
of
a
reasonable
person
standard
to
a
set
of
facts
which
juries
and
laypeople
are
able
to
do,
and
we
accord
very
great
deference
to
those
determinations,
and
to
suggest
that
judge
hodges,
because
he
put
on
a
black
robe
and
sat
in
a
different
place
in
the
courtroom,
somehow
lost
his
ability
to
do
that,
which
is
simply...
you
know,
i
mean,
is
to
give...
not
giving
judge
hodges
much
credit
in
terms
of
applying,
you
know,
what
12
ordinary
citizens
of
alaska
did.
so
i
think
it's
basically...
it's
applying
a
definition
to
a
set
of
facts.
it
doesn't
involve
a
lot
of
legal
principles,
in
that
except
to
the
fact...
except
to
the
extent
that
the
judge
looks
at
the
factors
which
this
court
has
told
it
to
look
at,
and
it
doesn't
look
at
the
factors
this
court
says
is
irrelevant.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
