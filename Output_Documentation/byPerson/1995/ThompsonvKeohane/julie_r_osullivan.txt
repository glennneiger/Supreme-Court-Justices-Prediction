ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
thank
you,
your
honor,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
alaska
trial
court
rejected
petitioner's
challenge
for
the
admission
of
his
confession
under
miranda
v.
arizona,
holding
that
petitioner
was
not
in
custody
for
miranda
purposes
and
therefore
was
not
entitled
to
warnings
prior
to
the
interrogation
that
led
to
his
confession.
petitioner
was
convicted,
exhausted
his
state
remedy,
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
alaska,
and
was
denied
relief.
on
appeal,
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed,
holding
that
the
state
trial
court's
conclusion
that
petitioner
was
not
in
custody
constituted
a
finding
of
fact
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
correctness
under
section
2254(d)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
it
is
that
ruling
that
we
challenge
here.
in
a
case
where
all
the
historical
facts
are
conceded,
the
application
of
the
objective
miranda
custody
standard
to
these
facts
constitutes
a
mixed
question
that
should
be
reviewed
de
novo
under
this
court's
decision
in
miller
v.
fenton.
the
miller
decision
controls
here.
if
one
examines
the
process
by
which
a
custody
determination
is
made.
this
is
a
statute
we're
construing,
and
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
requires
on
its
face
that
the
presumption
of
correctness
only
apply
to
issues
of
fact.
now,
in
construing--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--yes,
your
honor.
i
apologize.
in
construing
what
constitutes
a
factual
issue
for
purposes
of
section
2254(d),
the
court
has
looked
to
the
traditional
distinction
drawn
between
issues
of
fact,
law,
and
mixed
questions
in
townsend
v.
sain,
a
decision
from
which
congress
drew
the
presumption
codified
in
section
2254(d).
based
on
a
series
of
cases,
the
court
has
applied
the
section
2254(d)
presumption
to
questions
of
historical
facts.
in
justice
white's
words,
who
did
what
to
whom
and
when?
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
yes,
your
honor,
i--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so.
those
cases,
the
jury
bias,
competency,
and
intent
cases,
constitute
cases
that
look
nominally
like
mixed
questions
but
essentially
the
court,
in
reducing
what
constitutes
the
legal
standard
in
that
case,
has
reduced
them
to
questions
of
historical
fact
concerning
the
state
of
mind
of
a
particular
actor.
in
such
circumstances,
your
honor,
there
is
no
real
mixed
question
for
purposes
of
section
2254(d).
once
one
has
applied
the
section
2254(d)
presumption
to
the
historical
facts
as
found
by
the
district
courts,
there
is
no
second
step.
there
is
no
need
to
apply
the
legal
standard
to
those
facts.
there
is
no
legal
component
to
the
mixed
question.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
it's
our
contention
that
the
first
step
in
the
process,
the
determination
of
historical
facts,
would
be
accorded
a
section
2254(d)
presumption
of
correctness.
the
second--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--your
honor,
i
believe
in
the
negligence
context
the
question
of
whether...
how
a
reasonable
person
acted
really
is
a
mixed
question,
and
it
asks
for
legal
determination--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
generally
given
to
the
jury
to
decide.
however,
as
this
court
held
last
term
in
gouden,
a
jury
is
not
only
confined
to
factfinding.
there
are
often
situations
when
the
jury
is
required
to
make
legal
determinations,
to
apply
the
law
to
facts,
and
the
considerations
that
prevail
in
according
a
mixed
question
to
a
jury
as
opposed
to
a
judge
in
a
negligence
situation
are
different
than
the
kinds
of
considerations
that
one
must
consider
in
allocating
between
the
trial
judge
and
the
appellate
judge
in
a
certain
circumstance.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
yes,
your
honor,
they
make
that
determination
with
respect
to
negligence
and
other
state
law
issues.
they're
not
making
that
determination
with
respect
to
a
very
important
threshold
issue
regarding
federal
constitutional
procedures.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
miranda
is
necessary
to
safeguard
an
essential
fifth
amendment
trial
right,
as
the
court
found
in
withrow.
while
the
miranda
standard
may
itself
not
be
constitutional,
it
is
at
least
quasi
constitutional
because
of
its
relationship
to
the
fifth
amendment
trial
rights.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--your
honor,
i
think
that...
the
court
has
said
the
miranda
right
in
terms
of
its
constitutional,
quasi
constitutional
status,
clearly
distinguishes
it
from
the
negligence
situation.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
yes,
your
honor,
in
a
negligence
state
court
case.
when
they're
called
upon
to
say
what
is
a
reasonable
man,
they're
not
looking
at
who's
the
average
joe
blow.
they're
looking
at
what
should
the
rule
of
law
be
in
these
circumstances
given
the--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--well--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--their
object
is
to
figure
out,
given
community
standards,
what
is
reasonable
in
the
circumstance.
in
the
current--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
that,
respectfully.
what
the
jury
is
applying
in
a
negligence
situation
is
community
standards.
what
a
federal
judge
in
a
miranda
context
is
required
to
apply
in
assessing
reasonableness
in
a
certain
circumstance
are
the
fifth
amendment
values
underlying
miranda.
that
is
something
that
he
or
she
is
particularly
well
qualified
to
do.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
what
the
court
has
looked
to
in
berkemer,
mathis,
and
a
number
of
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
is
whether
the
circumstances
constitute
a
sufficient
threat
to
a
defendant's
or
a
suspect's
free
exercise
of
their
fifth
amendment
rights
so
as
to
require
that
miranda
warnings
be
provided--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--my
point,
your
honor,
is
in
interpreting
what
a
reasonable
person
would
think,
the
court
is
essentially
saying
what...
in
looking
at
the
values
underlying
miranda
that
i've
stated
and
determining
what
the
rules
should
be,
given
those
values,
it's
not
simply
looking
to
a
factual
determination
of
whether
he
was
handcuffed
to
a
table.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
there
are
cases
where
the
court
was
much
more
terse
in
its
explanation
for
its
holding
such
as,
perhaps,
mathiason
and
beheler,
but
there
are
definitely
cases,
your
honor,
such
as
berkemer
being
the
prime
example,
where
the
court
said,
we're
not
going
to
rely
on
talismanic
recitation
of
the
definition
of
miranda
custody.
we're
going
to
look
beyond
that
to
see
whether
the
concerns
implicated...
or
the
concerns
that
drove
the
miranda
court
are
implicated
in
a
given
context.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
the
stansbury
case,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
the
stansbury
case,
though,
made
clear,
your
honor,
that
that
case
was
designed...
in
that
case
the
court
felt
that
it
was
simply
reiterating
a
rule
that
it
felt
that
everybody
would
have
known
by
now,
and
that
its
preceding
cases
had
established
a
reasonable
person
standard
from
the
beginning,
so
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
reasonable
person
standard
certainly
was
in
place
at
least
by
the
point
of
berkemer.
justice
souter,
my
second
response
to
your
suggestion
is
this,
is
that
when
we're
looking
at
the
policies
that
determine
whether
something
should
be...
whether
a
mixed
question
should
be
allocated,
say,
to
what
is
primarily
denominated
as
a
factfinder
or
to
an
appellate
court,
we
can
talk
about
those
policies,
but
i
submit
that
that
determination
has
already
been
made
by
congress
and
this
court.
this
court
has
made
very
clear
that
mixed
questions
that
added,
in
townsend's
words,
the
application
of
law
to
fact
or
the
determination
of
the
legal
significance
of
the
facts
as
found,
is
a
question
that
is
reserved
for
plenary
review
in
federal
court.
that
determination
has
been
made.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
in
habeas
cases,
your
honor,
under
2254(d)
and
2254
generally.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
mm-hmm.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
in
the
negligence
context
again
you're
asking
the
community
to
decide,
looking
backward,
whether
certain
conduct
should
be
sanctioned,
whether
somebody
should
be
made
liable
for
that
conduct
based
on
community
standards.
we're
not
asking
that
those
standards
be
imposed
nationwide.
a
jury
in
illinois...
we're
encouraging
a
jury
in
illinois
to
apply
a
different
standard
than
a
jury
in
maine.
by
contrast,
in
this
situation,
what
we
have
is,
we
have
a
federal
quasi-constitutional
standard.
we
are
asking
courts
to
not
only
define
what
that
standard
means
by
applying
the
standard
in
the
context
of
each
particular
case,
but
we're
also
asking
the
appellate
court
to
define
a
uniform,
at
least
consistent
body
of
law
regarding
the
meaning
of
that
standard.
it's
particularly
important
because
in
this
context,
just
as
in
the
fourth
amendment
context,
we're
asking
law
enforcement
to
conform
their
conduct
to
those
rules.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
i
think
that's
why
the
court
adopted
an
objective
standard
for
custody,
your
honor.
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
treat
this
as
a
question
of
fact
that
could
differ
with
the
jurisdiction
with
the
suspect's
particular
susceptibility
or
the
police's
particular
conduct,
it
could
have
easily
have
applied
this
objective
test.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
the
difficulty
with
having
that
kind
of
disparity
would
be
twofold.
first
of
all,
it
would
result
in
a
disparity
among
defendants
depending
on
whether
they
were
arrested
in
california
or
new
york,
and
the
extent
of
protection
afforded
to
them
by
miranda,
which
should
not
be
countenanced.
second--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--and
then
where
would
we
be.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
that's
correct,
your
honor--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--i
was
going
to
add
that
i
think
that
that's...
that
basically
yes,
we
want
a
uniform
rule
regarding
what
miranda
stands
for
in
various
parts
of
the
country
in
part
because
police
officers
in
various
parts
of
the
country
don't
necessarily...
certainly
federal
agents
shouldn't
have
to
conform
their
conduct
to
the
peculiar
circumstances
of,
say,
new
jersey.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
mm-hmm.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
it's
often
difficult
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
to
give
clear
guidance.
however,
this
is
one
situation
where,
to
the
extent
the
courts
are
able
to
come
up
with
that
guidance,
it
must
be
uniform
guidance
across
the
country,
is
my
point.
i
recognize
that
it's
a
totality
of
the
circumstance
test,
but
by
applying
the
standard
in
various
contexts,
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
this
court,
provide
guidance
for
police
officers.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
yes.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
mm-hmm.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
well,
your
honor,
in...
i
think
the
statute...
as
i've
tried
to
point
out
before,
i
think
the
statute
decides
it
for
you.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
the
court--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--your
honor,
i
think
the
decision
has
been
made
for
the
court
how
to
deal
with
that
particular
circumstance.
i
think
the
court's
precedents
make
clear
that
when
you
have
the
application
of
a
legal
standard
to
the
facts,
it's
actually
a
legal
standard
not
a--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
i
think
in
the
custody
context,
your
honor,
it's
not...
it's
not...
obviously
the
court's
cases
say,
it
just
is
not
always
easy,
but
to
the
extent
you
can
make
it
easy,
the
courts
have
done
so.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
you
completely
on
that
question,
because
the
question
of
whether
somebody,
whether
a
reasonable
person,
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
have
believed
under
the
circumstance,
is
simply
not
a
historical
question
of
fact.
it's
not--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--right.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
yes.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
well,
it's
my
belief,
your
honor,
that
when
you're
resolving
a
reasonable-person
test
in
the
miranda
context,
in
most
cases
what
you're
doing
is
looking
back
to
miranda
and
you're
saying,
does
this
make
sense
in
the
circumstances?
what
should
the
law
be?
you're
applying
a
legal
judgment
based
on...
primarily
on
fifth
amendment
values,
not
based
on
factual
circumstances.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
in
the
fourth
amendment
context
i
think
stone
v.
powell
would
prevent
the
court
reaching
the
treatment
of
these
issues
for
purposes
of
section--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--yes,
your
honor.
we
contend,
obviously,
that...
the
treatment
of
the
issue
should
be
the
same
under...
on
habeas
review.
in
the
fourth
amendment
context,
your
honor,
the
court
has
consistently
treated
the
question
of
whether
someone
has
been
seized
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
the
question
whether
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
for
that
seizure,
the
question
whether
that
seizure,
the
permissible
estoppel...
sorry,
the
permissible
extent
of
the
terry
estoppel
has
been
exceeded,
has
treated
all
those
questions
de
novo.
i
think
in
that
circumstance
the
court
recognized
that
this
is
fundamentally
a
legal
judgment
that
we're
being
required
to
make,
and
moreover
it's
a
legal
judgment
that
should
warrant
final
determination
by
appellate
courts
for
two
reasons.
first,
you
want
to
ensure
that
the
judgment
is
correct,
that...
you've
got
a
developing
standard.
the
standard
develops,
its
attains
these
meaning,
these
general
standards
as
to
what
constitutes
custody,
don't
tell
the
police
this
is
a
situation
where
we
have
custody
and
that
isn't.
they
only
attain
their
meaning
by
application,
and
in
the
fourth
amendment
context,
the
allocation
of
final
responsibility
to
appellate
courts
is
important,
because
it
allows
the
court
to
control
the
development
of
this
standard
to
ensure
that
the
standard
is
consistent
with
its
fourth
amendment
values
and
with
concerns
that
drive
the
courts
in
the
fourth
amendment.
and
the
second--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--mm-hmm.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--your
honor,
in
those
circumstances...
here
in
this
context
what
you
have
is
a
two-part
inquiry.
the
trial
court
will
determine
the
historical
facts
surrounding
the
interrogation.
it
will
then
apply
the
miranda
custody
standard
to
those
facts.
the
first
step
in
the
inquiry
is
subject
to
2254(d)'s
presumption.
when
one
applies
the
legal
standard
to
those
facts,
there
is
a
legal
standard
to
be
applied.
we're
making
a
legal
value
judgment.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--your
honor--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--they're
going
to
be
issues
of
fact,
but,
your
honor,
the
critical
inquiry,
there
is
nothing
but
a
question
of
fact.
the
court's
definition
of
what
constitutes
jury
bias,
the
legal
standard
collapses
into
nothing
more
than
a
question
of
subjective
fact.
what
was
in
this
person's
state
of
mind?
in
that
circumstance,
there
is
no
legal
standard
to
be
applied
to
section
2254(d)'s
presumption
as
applied
to
that
determinative
fact--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--your
honor,
in
the
custody
cases,
the
court
has
refused
to
reduce
miranda
custody
to
a
question
of
fact,
to
a
subjective
inquiry
into
a
particular
person's
state
of
mind,
or
to
a
question
of
historical
fact.
the
court
has
refused
to
adopt
bright
line
rules
as
to
when
one
factual
circumstance
exists
or
doesn't
exist.
rather,
the
court
has
required
a
reasonable
person
inquiry
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
that
is
the
quintessential
legal
inquiry.
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
ms.

where
the--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--yes.
i
think
we're
having
the
same
discussion
that
we
had--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
--yes.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
that
it
is
ultimately
a
value
judgment
made
in
light
of
the
fifth
amendment.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
although
i
don't
think
every
subjective
test
necessarily
needs
to
be
a
factual
inquiry.
in
cases
where
you
have
a
hybrid
inquiry,
like
miller,
that's
a
voluntariness
inquiry,
the
court
has
treated
that
as
a
question
of
law.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor--
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
respondent
has
nothing...
petitioner
has
nothing
further.
ms.
julie
r.
o'sullivan
thank
you.
