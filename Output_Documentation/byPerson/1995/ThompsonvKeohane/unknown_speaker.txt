unknown
speaker
the
actual
statutory
language
is
factual
issues,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
it
hasn't
gone
beyond
that?
unknown
speaker
how
about
cases
like
maggio
and
rushen,
patton
v.
yount?
surely
they're...
just
more
than
strictly
historical
fact
is
involved
there,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about...
what
about
an
issue
that
turns
on
a
reasonable
person
standard?
does
that
of
necessity
amount
to
some
kind
of
mixed
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
negligence
context,
do
we
treat
it
really
as
a
question
of
fact
for
a
jury?
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
treat
it
that
way,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
instrumentally,
ms.
o'sullivan,
supposing
one
were
to
draft
a
statute
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
subject
directly
rather
than
the
general
aim,
what
is
gained
when
all
we're
talking
about
what
would
a
reasonable
person
think
by
pulling
all
the
powers
of
the
federal
courts
to
make
that
final
determination?
i
mean,
there's
nothing
peculiarly
federal
about
the
determination
of
what
is
a
reasonable
person.
state
courts
make
that
sort
of
determination
every
day,
as
justice
o'connor
has
suggested.
unknown
speaker
well,
federal
constitutional
procedures?
you're
saying
miranda
is
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
quasi-constitutional
mean?
unknown
speaker
maybe
you
should
ask
us.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is
there
something
unusual
about
the
mixed
fact
law
question
involving
a
reasonable
person
standard?
in
the
run-of-the-mill
mixed
fact
and
law
question
that
goes
to
a
jury,
the
judge
instructs
the
jury
on
the
content
of
the
law.
in
reasonable-person
kind
of
cases,
the
judge
doesn't.
the
judge
simply
says,
you
know,
would
a
reasonable
person
feel
this
way,
and
in
effect
the
practice,
i
think
throughout
the
united
states,
is
that
the
reasonable
person
is
for
the
jury
to
determine.
there
is...
it's
a
case
in
which
the
jury
gives
the
content
to
the
law.
does
that
argue
for...
i
know
you
would
still
have
the
argument
saying,
well,
it
should
still
be
a
federal
reasonable
person,
and
therefore
federal
courts
ought
to
review,
but
that
does
put
the
reasonable
person
kind
of
mixed
law
or
fact
question
in
sort
of
a
different
status
from
the
usual
mixed
question,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
doing
it,
but
do
judges
tell
them
that?
the
judge
simply
says,
is
it
reasonable
or
not,
and
you're
the
judge
as
to
what
is
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
so
they
figure
out
what
the
reasonable
as
distinct
from
the
average
person
does.
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
be
a...
at
least
that
would
be
one
reason
for
holding
this
to
be
an
unreviewable
question
of
fact
classifying
it
as
such,
not
being
there
isn't
an
element
of
law
there,
but
because
that
element
of
law
is
really
left
to
the
jury
to
supply
the
content
of.
and
then
you
would
come
back,
i
take
it,
to
your
second
argument
and
say,
if
you're
going
to
keep
control
of
miranda,
you've
got
to
make
sure
that
this
jury
construct
is
at
least
a
federal
one,
and
so
you...
for
that
reason,
you...
the
federal
court
still
ought
to
review
it,
but
there
would
be
an
argument
for
saying
no
judicial
review,
wouldn't
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
fifth
amendment
values
are
involved
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
person
would
have
thought
he
was
free
to
leave?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
not...
i
don't
believe
that's
an
accurate
statement
of
our
definitions
of
custody,
which
is
admittedly
only
a
prong
of
the
miranda
test,
but
it
simply
is
a
reasonable...
would
a
reasonable
person
have
felt
free
to
leave
the
site
of
the
interrogation?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you're
wrong,
ms.
o'sullivan...
you
certainly
can
disagree
with
me...
in
suggesting
that
all
of
our
cases
say
that
some
kind
of
supersophisticated
inquiry
based
on
fifth
amendment
value...
i
can
certainly
think
of
cases
which
have
simply
repeated
the
phrase,
did
the
defendant
feel
free
to
leave,
would
a
person
in
the
defendant's
position
have
felt
free
to
leave,
without
going
through
all
the
other
mumbo-jumbo.
unknown
speaker
but
berkemer
was
decided
considerably
before
the
case
a
couple
of
years
ago
that
said
the
test
is
that
of
a
reasonable
person,
that
one
of
california,
from
california.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
in
all
cases,
or
only
in
some
cases?
for
example,
in
fela
cases
the
reasonable--
unknown
speaker
--i
take
it
you
recognize
that
in
some
cases
reasonableness
is
for
the
trier,
whether
judge
or
jury,
the
subject
is
clearly
erroneous,
but
in
other
cases,
reasonableness
requires
policing
by
an
appellate
forum.
unknown
speaker
and
the
standard
by
which
we
can
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
is
that
in
the
second
category
what
is
the
need
for
special
policing?
is
there
some
way
we
can
tell
well,
we
can
tolerate
a
lot
of
inconsistency,
even,
with
different
juries
coming
out
differently
on
reasonable--
unknown
speaker
--but
why
can't
we
tolerate
the
same
uncertainty
about
in
custody,
so
one
group
would
find
not
in
custody,
another
part
would
find
in
custody,
they're
both
reasonable,
so
appellate
court
would
leave
them
alone?
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting,
ms.
o'sullivan,
that
a
finder
of
fact
or
determiner
of
this
question,
say,
in
new
york
city,
would
reach
the
exact
same
conclusion
that
a
determiner
of
this
fact
in
alaska?
i
mean,
how
about...
you
know,
don't
fence
me
in.
maybe
people
in
the
west
may
be
less
likely
to
feel
free
to
leave,
or
be
more
likely
to
free
to
leave
than
people
in
new
york
or
los
angeles.
is
it,
indeed,
a
case
in
which
the
factual...
given
the
facts
in
a
particular
case,
courts
all
over
the
united
states
must
reach
the
same
result?
unknown
speaker
no,
not
the
suspect's...
not
the
peculiar
character
of
the
suspect
at
all,
but
just
what
reasonable
people
in
a
community
might
feel
about
actions
concerning
an
interrogation.
maybe
a
person
in
alaska
might
have
felt
free
to
leave
under
these
circumstances,
and
a
person
in
new
york
might
not
have.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
that
that's
right,
ms.
o'sullivan,
because
if
the
reasonable
person
tests
says,
did
i
feel...
did
a
reasonable
person
feel
free
to
leave,
maybe
people
in
new
york
just
react
differently
than
people
in
alaska
to
the
same
set
of
circumstances.
of
course,
you
might
have
a
new
yorker
arrested
in
alaska.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
your
answer
might...
would
this
be
a
possible
answer,
that
even
if
in
fact
there
are
different,
geographically
differing
standards
of
feelings
of
freedom
to
leave,
whether
the
feeling
is
sufficient
enough
for
miranda
purposes
is
still
a
federal
question,
so
you
would
still
want
a
federal
court
in
alaska
or
california
or
boston
or
wherever
it
might
be
ultimately
to
pass
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
satisfaction
of
the
federal
standard
even
if
people
feel
differently
about
leaving
in
various
parts
of
the
country?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
correct,
then
maybe...
finish
if
you
want.
you
were
going
to
add
something.
unknown
speaker
but
ms.
o'sullivan,
haven't
you...
that's
a
point
you
can't
go
back
to.
we're
dealing
with
a
reasonable
person,
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
standard.
unknown
speaker
what
you've
just
said
sounds
like
the
police,
the
primary
addressee
should
be
the
police
officer,
the
police
officer
should
have
clear
marching
instructions,
when
do
i
have
to
give
miranda,
when
do
i
don't,
but
now
we
have
to
make
that
determination
after
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
i
don't--
--well...
no,
go
ahead.
what's
actually
bothering
me
very
much...
you're
touching
on
it,
and
i
don't
know
how
this
would
come
out,
but
i
think
you're
quite
right,
facts
are
normally
historically
based,
but
not
totally.
if
i
look
at
that
cloth
up
there,
i
don't
know
if
that's
damask
or
not.
i've
never
known
what
damask
meant.
it's
solely
a
question
of
applying
a
label
to
that
cloth,
and
i
guess
we'd
call
in
a
cloth
expert
but
not
a
lawyer,
so
sometimes
we
don't
call
in
lawyers
to
apply
words
in
statutes
to
historical
situations.
unknown
speaker
and
when
we
don't,
we
still
call
them
factual
matters.
and
so,
i
take
it,
here,
the
question
really
is,
applying
these
words
in
this
statute,
in
custody,
to
a
given
historical
set
of
facts,
are
we
calling
upon
legal
skills,
in
which
case
it's
a
legal
matter--
unknown
speaker
--or
are
we
calling
upon
psychiatric
skills,
ordinary
person
skills,
in
which
case
it's
still
a
factual
matter,
and
when
i
say
that
to
myself...
and
you
seem
to
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
then
i'm
forced
to
the
answer,
it
all
depends.
it
depends
on
the
case.
sometimes
in
a
case
what's
really
at
issue
is
the
law
in
applying
this
word,
in
custody.
sometimes,
because
everybody
agrees
what
we'd
say
is
ordinary
people,
but
given
miranda,
blah,
blah,
blah,
how
does
it
apply,
that's...
and
very
often
it
doesn't
call
for
legal
skills.
it
applies
for
perfectly
ordinary
human
skills.
so
if
we
both
think
that,
what
am
i
to
do?
unknown
speaker
but
all
right,
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
to
add
that,
it
says,
factual
matters
are
to
go
to
the
factfinder.
fine,
and
i'd
say
very
often,
for
the
reasons
that
the
chief
just
articulated,
very
often
all
that
we're
interested
in
here
is
whether
an
ordinary
human
being,
whether
he's
a
judge
or
not,
would
say
that
a
reasonable
person
would
feel
confined,
an
answer
that
may
vary
from
alaska
to
hawaii.
but
sometimes
we're
interested
in
uniquely
legal
aspects
of
it,
how
those
words
fit,
so
how
did
it
decide
here?
unknown
speaker
you
always
have.
you
always--
unknown
speaker
--one
case
where
that
isn't
so
is
where
the
legal
standard
happened
to
be
competency
to
stand
trial,
because
there
the
label,
competency,
is
normally,
but
not
100
percent,
a
matter
of
psychiatric
interpretation,
so
we'd
call
in
psychiatrists,
like
the
damask
expert,
not
lawyers,
but
sometimes
you'd
want
to
call
in
lawyers,
even
there.
i'm
not
saying...
i
mean,
i'm
saying
i'm
genuinely
puzzled
by
this
problem,
and
therefore
i'd
appreciate
help.
unknown
speaker
if
we
made
it
easy
here
you'd
say,
normally,
the
words
in
custody
don't
call
for
legal
interpretations.
normally,
they
call
for
human
judgments
about
how
people
reasonably
behave.
unknown
speaker
no,
it's
not,
but
it's
applying
a
label
to
a
set
of--
unknown
speaker
--historical
facts
and
activity
in
which
nonlawyers
like...
engage
every
day
of
the
week,
and
when
nonlawyers
do
engage
in
it,
we
call
that
a
factual
question,
too.
unknown
speaker
and
now
that's...
that's
at
that
point
that
i
need
help.
unknown
speaker
ms.
o'sullivan,
would
the
same
go
for,
say,
the
bus
search
cases?
would
we
engage
in
the
same
reasoning
under
the
test
that
justice
o'connor
announced
in
the
bostick
case,
also
would
a
reasonable
person
feel
free
to
leave?
is
that
also
the
kind
of
question
that
under
2254
would
get
de
novo
review?
unknown
speaker
how
about
let's
put
it
on
direct
review?
unknown
speaker
ms.
o'sullivan,
would
you
explain
to
me
again
how
you
distinguish
what
seem
to
me
a
lot
of
cases
where
we've
held
that
things
that
you
would
consider
to
be
legal
determinations
or
factual
determinations
such
as
competency
to
waive
postconviction
relief--
unknown
speaker
--how
come
that
is--
unknown
speaker
--treated
differently
from
what
you
urge
us
to
do
here?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
case
in
all
of
these
things.
competency
to
waive
postconviction
relief,
they're
going
to
be
facts.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
the
person
was
banging
his
head
against
the
cell
wall
or
he
wasn't
banging
his
head
against
the
cell
wall.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
he
thought
he
was
napoleon
or
he
didn't
think
he
was
napoleon.
these
are
all
going
to
be
issues...
they're
always
going
to
issues
of
fact
in--
unknown
speaker
--you
could
say
the
same
thing
here.
did
the
person...
you
know,
would
a
reasonable
person
feel
free
to
leave?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
was
just...
you
just
fell
off
the
wagon
a
little
bit,
because
the
other
thing
that's
factual,
i
take
it,
is
the
application
of
the
label
to
the
historical
facts
under
circumstances
where
that
application
calls
for
nonlegal
skills.
unknown
speaker
you're
following
that,
right?
it's
a
little
technical
i
just
said.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
think
is
at
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
that
you
said
that
here
it
calls
for
legal
skills
rather
than
nonlegal
skills,
the
question
of
how
reasonable
people
might
feel,
is
basically--
unknown
speaker
--you
would
say
all
objective
standards
are...
you're
saying
all
of
the
cases
where
we
treat
them
as
facts,
the
standard
is
a
subjective
one,
a
purely
subjective
one?
unknown
speaker
and
where
the
standard--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
ms.
o'sullivan.
ms.
hora,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
always
fact-bound,
but
the
difficulty
of
resolution
is
going
to
vary.
i
mean,
sometimes,
let's
say
when
the
only
issue
was,
was
the
defendant
walking
in
and
out
of
the
interrogation
room
giving
press
interviews
in
the
meantime,
that's
a
simple
question
of
fact,
and
if
that's
what
the
issue
of
custody
turns
on,
then
you
really
can
say
there
wasn't
any
legal
issue
in
this
determination,
it
was
just
a
purely
factual
one.
but
then
you
have
cases
like
this
in
which
it
may
be
very,
very
close,
and
at
that
point
it's
hard
to
articulate
a
set
of
facts
which
determines
the
answer,
and
at
that
point
there's
kind
of
a
point
at
which
the
instinctive
legal
judgment
has
to
be
what
finally
resolves
the
issue.
so
that
in
a
case
like
this,
the
factual
element...
the
difficulty
of
the
factual
element,
in
fact,
is
not
great,
but
the
difficulty
of
the
legal
element
great,
so
in
a
case
like
this,
isn't
it
fair
to
say,
well,
this
isn't
the
kind
of
fact-bound
case
that
we
say
we
don't
want
to
be
wasting
legal
time
on
or
need
to
waste
legal
time
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
are--
unknown
speaker
--in
effect
saying
that
the
miranda
standard
is
going
to
vary
by
virtue
of
a
fact
determination
without
review.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
we...
you're
in
effect,
i
think,
saying
we
want
miranda
juries
to
have
the
same
kind
of
policy,
the
same
kind
of
policy
autonomy
that
we
want
automobile
negligence
juries
to
have,
and
we
don't
want
that,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
miranda
question,
the
question
of
in
custody,
isn't
ordinarily
submitted
to
a
jury
anyway,
is
it?
isn't
it
determined
in
a
preliminary
motion
by
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
and
accept
that
argument,
that
this
is
a
classic
fact
determination
in
which
we
defer
to
the
first
instance
decisionmaker,
whether
judge
or
jury,
then
the
alaska
court
of
appeals
did
something
extra
that
it
didn't
need
to
do,
isn't
that
so,
because
the
alaska
court
of
second
instance
did
give
this
de
novo
review,
did
it
not--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
custody
determi--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
so
you
say
that
the
alaska
court...
so
nobody
has
ever
given
this...
nobody
would
ever
give
this
de
novo
review,
not
at
the
state
appellate
level,
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
answer
to
the
question,
was
this
person
in
custody,
i
had
thought,
but
you're
correcting
me
that
i
was
wrong,
that
at
least
inside
the
state
the
first
appellate
review
is
de
novo.
unknown
speaker
so
what
you're
arguing,
then,
is
that
they
should
never
be...
there
never
need
be
a
de
novo
review,
that
the
first
instance
decisionmaker
decides
the
question,
anybody
else
it's
a
clearly
erroneous--
unknown
speaker
--why
should
it
matter
what
the
state
does
with
it?
i
mean,
all
of
these
policy
considerations
are
very
interesting,
but
we're
dealing
with
a
federal
statute,
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
just
a
matter
of
what
the
terms
in
the
federal
statute
mean.
unknown
speaker
the
state
may,
for
purposes
of
its
internal
appeals,
choose
to
treat
the
matter
differently
from
what
the
federal
statute
requires
us
to
consider
them
as,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
there's
a
different
problem
which
i
don't
think
you
do
touch
on
in
your
catalog,
and
that
is
the
problem
that
arises
from
the
fact
that
what
is
a
sufficient
sense
of
freedom
to
leave,
which
is
the
consideration
that
drives
the
application
of
miranda,
is
difficult
to
articulate,
and
it
cannot
be
articulated...
it
isn't
articulated
simply
by
saying,
well,
it's
what
a
reasonable
person
would
feel.
that
just
passes
the
buck
to
whoever
is
going
to
determine
what
the
reasonable
person
does
feel,
and
in
those...
in
instances
like
that,
where
it
is
very
difficult
to
articulate
the
standard,
ultimately
the
only
way
you
can
show
what
it
means
is
by
pointing
to
examples
that
you
yourself
supply
and
says...
and
you
say,
this
is
it,
and
that
isn't.
in
this
case,
the
person
was
free
to
leave.
in
that
case,
it
wasn't.
and
when
you
have
standards
that
require
that
kind
of
nuance,
if
you
will,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
body
that
is
setting
the
law
has
got
to
keep
control
of
the
ultimate
application,
which
it
doesn't
do
on
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
because
otherwise
it's
not
going
to
be
able
to
tell
people
what
the
standard
is,
and
isn't
that
a
reason
for
saying
that
this
is
a
mixed
question
that
the
court
really
does
have
to
review,
and
therefore,
under
the
statute,
should
be
construed
as
subject
to
review?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not?
why
is
freedom
to
leave
somehow
less
subtle
than
true
willingness
to
speak?
unknown
speaker
well,
we're...
in
miranda
we're
talking
about
how
do
you
guarantee
the
constitutional
value
rule
as
opposed
to
an
absolute
first
instance
constitutional
value
rule,
but
we're
still
talking
about
standards
of
voluntariness,
and
i
don't
know
why
the
issue
of
voluntariness
is
somehow
less
subtle
in
the
miranda
context
than
it
is
in
the
confession
or
the
admission
context.
maybe
it
is,
but
i
don't
understand
why.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
we're
talking
about
the...
we're
saying
there
is
a
subtlety
of
fact
here,
how
much
is
enough,
and
i
thought
you
were...
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
were
saying,
well,
it's
easier
to
say
how
much
is
enough
in
miranda
than
it
is
to
say
how
much
is
enough
on
voluntariness
of
confession,
and
how
much
is
enough
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
primary
constitutional
rule
or
a
secondary
constitutional
rule,
the
concept,
how
much
is
enough,
how
free
is
free,
is
the
same.
why
is
it
more
subtle
in
the
confession
context
than
it
is
in
the
miranda
context?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
have
that
much
freedom
under
the
statute?
yes,
why
do
we
look
to
policy
con...
i
mean,
it's
all
very
interesting,
these
policy...
we
have
a
statute
that
says
that
a
determination
after
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
a
factual
issue
shall
be
given
effect
by
the
federal
court,
on
the
merits
of
a
factual
issue.
that's
a
statute
passed
after
a
decision
of
ours
in
which
we
said,
by
issues
of
fact
we
mean
to
refer
to
what
are
termed
basic,
primary,
or
historical
facts,
facts
in
the
sense
of
a
recital
of
external
events
and
the
credibility
of
the
narrators.
that's
an
opinion
by
justice
frankfurter
that
was
on
the
books
when
this
statute
was
enacted.
why
shouldn't
we
just
take
the
statute
to
be
incorporating
a
term
of
art
that
we
have
defined
in
our
opinions?
unknown
speaker
it's
totally
factual,
as
your
colleague
points
out.
it
is
a
factual
determination
of
whether
the
juror
was
biased
or
not.
unknown
speaker
no.
it's
whether
a
reasonable...
whatever
this
individual
felt,
would
a
reasonable
person
in
this
individual's
position
have
felt
free
to
leave.
that's...
it's
not
a
factual
question,
it's
a
judgment,
bringing
in,
or
bringing
down
the
reasonable
person.
unknown
speaker
that
may
well
be,
but
i'm
working
with
this
statute.
i'm
working
with
a
statute
that
says,
an
issue
of
fact,
and
we
base
a
lot
of
issues
of
fact
in
our
opinion
on--
--i
mean,
frankfurter
wasn't
exhaustive
in
his
list.
i
mean,
there
are
dozens
of
cases
where
experts
in
trials
decide
factual
matters
about
whether
it's
a
patent
or
whether
it's
a
this,
or
whether
it's
carbon
monoxide,
or
whatever
it
is,
and
that
kind
of
a
case
is
what's
presented
here.
that
doesn't
mean
you're
right,
but--
--well,
he
wrote
many
years
before
this
statute
was
adopted.
unknown
speaker
when
was
this
statute
passed?
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
i
read
from
was
in
1963.
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
i...
even
if
we
assume
that
there
are
some
cases
in
which
the
court
does
have...
there's
some
play
in
the
joints
here,
and
there
are
some
cases
that
are
very
close
to
call,
we
still
come
back
to
the
problem
of
differentiating
the...
even
the
factual
issue,
or
articulating
a
factual
issue
of
what
is
voluntariness
in
one
context
and
what
is
voluntariness
in
another
which
would
make
it
very
difficult,
it
seems
to
me,
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
voluntary
confession
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me
why...
tell
me
why,
assuming
we
have
the
opportunity
to
do
it,
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
we
have,
but
if
we
have
the
opportunity
to
do
it,
tell
me
why
we
should
treat
it
differently
here.
why
is
the
one
inquiry
more
subtle
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
that--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
not
sure
that
that
gets
you
where
you
want
to
go,
because
that
is
simply,
it
seems
to
me,
a
premise
for
the
argument
that
this
court
better
keep
control,
or
federal
courts
better
keep
control,
of
just
where
to
draw
that
line.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we
start...
the
premise
of
my
question
was
that
it's
very
difficult
to
define
the
standard
in
so
many
words
because
it's
very
difficult
to
describe
the
degree
of
voluntariness
upon
which
it
depends,
and
if
we're
going
to
have
merely
clearly
erroneous
review,
that's
going
to
leave
an
extremely
large
area
of
factual
discretion
in
the
state
courts,
and
i...
my
suggestion
was
that,
assuming
we
have
a
choice,
that
we
probably
better
not
leave
that
great
degree
of
discretion
because
if
we
do,
we
basically
have
lost
control
of
miranda,
and
it's
going
to
be...
it's
going
to
vary
significantly
from
state
to
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
we're
just
not
engaging
in
the
same
argument,
because
i'm
starting
with
the
premise
that
it
is
very
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
articulate
those
premises
without
from
time
to
time
picking
a
few
examples
out
and
saying,
this
is
it,
that
isn't,
and
you
in
effect
are
saying
no,
you
don't
have
to
go
through
that,
you
can
state
it
enough,
and
i
think
maybe
that's...
our
disagreement
is
maybe
unbridgeable
there.
i'm
saying
we
can
only
do
it
one
way,
and
you
are
saying,
oh,
you
could
do
it
another
way.
isn't
that
where
you
and
i
are
disagreeing
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me,
counsel,
that
when
you
were
suggesting
that
fundamental
constitutional
rights
are
subject
to
de
novo
review
in
the
courts,
or
some
plenary
review,
that
there
was
an
implicit
admission,
or
an
implicit
premise
that
control
by
the
courts
is
better
maintained
that
way,
and
that
it
is
more
important
to
have
control,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
what
justice
souter
is
suggesting
should
apply
in
miranda
cases,
even
if
we
don't
classify
that
as
a
fundamental
right.
unknown
speaker
or
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
another
one
where
there
would
be
de
novo
review,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
there
are
some
things
that
trigger
de
novo
review...
voluntariness,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel...
other
things
that
don't,
and
you're
saying
miranda
falls
on
the
side
with
jury
bias
and
not
on
the
side
with
voluntariness
or
ineffective
assistance.
why,
if
the
object
is
that
miranda
is
not
just
some
words
that
are
spoken
sometimes
but
words
that
must
be
spoken
at
a
certain
time,
doesn't
the
federal
court
need
to
have
control
over
what
that
time
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
standard,
other
than
in-custody?
who
fleshes
out
what
in-custody
means
by
saying,
certain
circumstances
are
not
in-custody,
certain
circumstances
are,
and
how
can
the
court
do
that
job
without
passing...
getting
a
body
of
cases
that
it
can
review
and
then
narrowing
the
range
of
choice
that
the
police
will
have?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
the
way
the
law
generally
builds
its...
it
says,
this
case
law's
on
that
side,
and
that
case
law's
on
the
other
side,
and
we
get
enough
of
the
cases,
then
we
can
state
some
broader
guiding
principle.
i
thought
that's
the
traditional
way
that
our
system
operates,
and
certainly
in
common
law
interpretation,
even
in
the
interpretation
of
statutes.
unknown
speaker
then
why
don't
we
go
back
and
reconsider
the
question
whether
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
should
be
subject
to
review
without
deference?
unknown
speaker
we
got
that
wrong,
didn't
we,
on
your
explanation,
because
there's
no...
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
reason
we
can't
state
the
legal
rule
clearly
and
leave
it
to
the
other
courts
to
apply.
we
got
it
wrong,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
mean,
if
we're
going
to
be
consistent,
if
we're
going
to
take
a
step
here,
we
ought
to
know
what
direction
we're
going
in,
and
i
think
we're
going
in
the
direction
of
saying
we
were
wrong
about
confessions.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
have
to
say
anything
about
it,
but
we're
going
to
set
miller
&
fenton
up
to
be
overruled,
aren't
we?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
why
is
that
a
distinction...
why
is
that
a
distinction
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
why
is
that
a
distinction
under
the
statute?
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
first
level
constitutional
claims,
second
level
constitutional
claims.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
policy
freedom
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
probably
involve
the
kind
of
policy
considerations
that
i
was
talking
about
a
moment
ago,
that
you
can't
keep
control
of
a
statute,
or
the
standard,
for
example,
if
you
don't
review
it
with
an
absence
of
deference,
but
do
you
think
miller
&
fenton
was
saying
we've
got
a
free
hand
to
decide
what
issues
of
fact
are
merely
important
enough?
unknown
speaker
okay.
may
i...
would
it
be
fair,
then,
to
summarize
by
saying
that
although
the
kind
of
analysis
may
be
the
same
in
each
case,
miranda
and
confession,
that
that
is...
we'll
simply
say
candidly
that
is
not
what
determines
it,
and
what
determines
it
is
the
importance
of
the
constitutional
issue
and
its
character
as
a...
we'll
call
it
a
first
tier
constitutional
issue,
as
opposed
to
a
second
tier
constitutional
issue.
that
is
the
basis
on
which
we
would
distinguish
them,
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
so
we
would...
we--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
good
statement,
actually,
in
an
opinion
i
think
that
norris
wrote.
i
don't
know
if
you
saw
it
in
mcconney,
where
he
describes
it
in
this
way,
trying
to
apply
this
label.
he
says
the
reason
it's
a
legal
question
in
part
is
because
its
resolution
requires
us
to
consider
abstract
legal
doctrines
to
weigh
underlying
policy
considerations
and
to
balance
competing
legal
interests.
now,
in
deciding
whether
a
person
is
in
custody,
are
the
activities
i
just
read
quite
frequently
involved?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
hora.
ms.
o'sullivan,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
