i
must
say,
i'm
interested
to
hear
this
difference
among
the
three
described
so
clearly
in
the
context
of
a
shell
game.
i
looked
up
the
common...
or
actually
had
a
hapless
law
clerk
look
up
the
common
law,
and
i
don't
find
that
there's
any
such
thing
as
a
common
law
action
for
misrepresentation.
there
is
for
false
pretenses
and
for
fraud,
but
if
there
is
one,
it's
news
to
us.

of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
19--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay,
but
that
is
a
bankruptcy
case
that's
already
dealing
with
this
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
rather
seen
an
old
common
law
case
that
talked
about
a
cause
of
action
for
misrepresentation,
and
i'm
not
sure...
misrepresentation
is
an
element
of
a
lot
of
other
causes
of
action,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you've
just
destroyed
your
prior
argument,
then.
if
you
say
that
the
materiality
element
is
enough
to
distinguish
(b)
from
(a),
why
do
you
have
to
also
say
that
the
scienter...
that
the
lack
of
reliance
is
necessary
to
distinguish
(b)
from
(a)?
why
can't
you
distinguish
(b)
from
(a)...
(2)(b)
from
(2)(a)
on
the
basis
of
any
one
of
those
features
in
(b),
that
it's
materially
false,
on
which
he
reasonably
relied,
caused
to
be
made
published
with
intent
to
deceive?
you
could
say
any
one
of
those
three.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
only
necessary
to
find
one
element
in
(b)
that
is
not
necessary
for
(a)
in
order
to
distinguish
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me...
you
know,
the
language,
we've
been
talking
as
though
they're
common
law
causes
of
action,
false
pretenses.
it
doesn't
say
false
pretenses,
false
representation
or
actual
fraud,
it
says
false
pretenses,
a
false
representation
or
actual
fraud.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
they're
talking
in
terms
of
common
law
causes
of
action
at
all,
and
if
there
is
a
reasonable
reliance
recorded
it
seems
to
me
it
comes
about
simply
because
we
would
not
interpret
the
language,
to
the
extent
obtained
by,
to
include
something
that
is
obtained
through
unreasonable
reliance.
the
causality
does
not
exist.
and
i
think
that's
the
same
way
the
common
law
came
to
its
conclusion
with
respect
to
fraud.
it's
not
obtained
by
fraud,
if,
indeed,
the
reliance
is
so
unreasonable
that
no...
causality
is
broken
by
the
stupidity
of
the
person
who
relied
when
he
shouldn't
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
well,
why
don't
we
read
it
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
acknowledge
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
certainly
a
false
representation
does
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
what
about
the
language,
obtained
by?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
reasonable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
say
there
has
to
be
a
causality,
and
the
causality
is
broken
when
there
is...
when
that
person
shouldn't
have
relied?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
common
law
cases,
or
bankruptcy
cases
trying
to
make
sense
out
of
this
unfathomable
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
well,
i
don't...
i
think
they're
pulling
it
out
of
the
air
to
try
to
give
some
meaning
to
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
see
some
common
law
cases
that
gave
those
meanings
to
these
words
before
congress
invented
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you...
well,
this
is
the
plain
language.
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
think
is
covered
by
(b)
that
wouldn't
be
covered
by
(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
only
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
as
though
the
duty
to
investigate
and
the
unreasonableness
of
the
reliance
are
two
separate
things.
they're
really
just
one
thing,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
unreasonable
to
rely
with
what
you
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
you
should
have
done
something
more.
