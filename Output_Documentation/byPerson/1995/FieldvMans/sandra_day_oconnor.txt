at
common
law,
must
the
reliance
be
justifiable,
however,
for
fraud?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
is
a
requirement
of
justifiability
at
least?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
has
to
be
intent
and
materiality?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
intent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hmm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
possibly
justifiability.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
know
what
the
difference
is
between,
what
are
the
three
categories,
false
pretenses,
false
representation,
and
actual
fraud?
are
those
three
different
things,
do
you
think?
justice

mr.
jenkins,
can
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question?
do
you
think
that
the
meaning
of
these
terms,
the
false
pretenses,
representation,
and
actual
fraud,
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
under
this
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
look
to
state
law
definitions,
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
might
we
look
to
the
common
law
definition
for
the
meaning
of
the
terms
that
congress
used?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you're
right,
then
this
case
turns
entirely
on
whether
we
think
reasonable
reliance
is
the
same
as
justifiable
reliance.
