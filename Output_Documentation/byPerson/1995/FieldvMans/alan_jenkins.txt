mr.
alan
jenkins
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
alan
jenkins
--we
do,
justice
o'connor.
in
fact--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
think
that's
correct.
in
fact,
we
disagree
with
petitioners
that
the
common
law
elements
of
fraud,
whatever
they
may
be,
are
controlling
in
this
case.
we
think
the
ordinary
rules
of
federal
statutory
construction,
in
particular
the
language,
the
structure,
and
the
history
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
are
better
tools
for
discerning
congress'
intent
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
think
that's
possible,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
better
source
is,
again,
the
structure
of
the
code,
and
in
particular
the
word,
fraud,
which
is
used
elsewhere
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
is
used
in
other
federal
statutes
which
this
court
in
grogan
v.
garner
indicated
are
better
sources
for
discerning
congress'
intent
when
it
used
the
term
fraud.
for
example,
in
the
false
claims
act,
a
federal
fraud
statute,
reasonable
reliance
is
not
required.
in
the
securities
laws,
reasonable
reliance
is
sometimes
required,
but
in
particular
situations
such
as
failure
to
disclose,
or
a
fraud
on
the
market
theory,
reasonable
reliance
is
not
required,
and
so
we
think
that
the
element
of
reasonable
reliance
that
was
required
in
this
case
is
not
inextricably
bound
with
the
term
fraud
as
congress
likely
intended
it.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
unclear
whether
false
representations
and
false
pretenses
are
common
law
terms
or
whether
they
in
fact
are
statutory
terms.
fraud
certainly
is
a
common
law
term,
but
we
think
that
in--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
that
may
be,
but
we
think
that's
not
the
best
explanation.
in
1978,
when
congress
created
the
bankruptcy
code,
revised
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898,
it
introduced
the
term,
actual
fraud,
and
looked
to
this
court's
decision
in
neal
v.
clark,
and
that
decision
indicated
that
the
term
fraud
means
scienter,
and
that
was
the
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
introduced
the
fraud
language.
mr.
alan
jenkins
it
is
in
the
legislative
history,
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
i
believe
footnote
5.
mr.
alan
jenkins
as
i've
said,
we
think
that
the
better
tool
of
statutory
construction
here
is
the
structure
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
section
523(a)(2)
exempts
from
discharge
two
independent
categories
of
fraudulently
incurred
debts.
paragraph
(b)
is
limited
to
false
statements
of
financial
condition,
expressly
includes
reasonable
reliance
as
one
of
its
elements.
paragraph
(a)
exempts
all
other
fraudulently
incurred
debts
and
contains
no
such
requirements.
in
our
view,
the
juxtaposition
of
those
two
provisions
requires
the
conclusion
that
reasonable
reliance
is
necessary...
must
be
proved
only
in
the
narrower
category
of
false
financial
statement
cases.
we
think
congress
would
have
had
no
reason
to
create
two
independent
provisions,
paragraphs
(a)
and
(b),
if,
as
the
respondent
argues,
it
had
intended
for
the
elements
of
those
provisions
to
be
identical.
congress
could
instead
have
simply
created...
introduced
a
single
reasonable
reliance
requirement
in
a
unified
section
523(a)(2).
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct.
it
would
have
treated
them
the
same,
as
it
did
in
section
17(a)(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
alan
jenkins
we
do
not,
your
honor,
as
to
paragraph
(a).
materiality--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--that's
correct.
we
look
at
the
language
in
paragraph
(a),
a
debt
obtained
by
fraud,
and
argue
that
requires
scienter,
which
is
derived
from
the
fraud
language,
and
causation.
causation
generally
will
require,
in
all
circumstances
will
require
actual
reliance,
that
the
listener
actually
relied
on
the
false
statement
and
that's
how
the
debt
was
created.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
your
honor,
we
do
say
that
those
two
provisions
have
different
elements.
scienter
is
required
in
both.
mr.
alan
jenkins
but
that
is
the
only
element
we
think,
except
for
causation,
that
is
required
in
both
(a)
and
(b).
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
suppose
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
addition
we've
noted
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
splitting
former
17(a)(2)
into
523(a)(2)(a)
and
(b),
and
it
indicates
that
the
reasonable
reliance
requirement
was
at
the
heart
of
that.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct,
under
(b).
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--right.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
think...
given
the
structure
of
the
act,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
if
someone
foolishly
relies,
or
is
particularly
gullible
under
paragraph
(a),
congress
intended
that
that
person
be
protected,
that
as
between
an
intentionally
dishonest
debtor
on
the
one
hand,
and
an
unwary
creditor
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
creditor
should
prevail,
except
where
there
had
been
a
pattern
of
abuse
in
precode
cases,
and--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
your
honor,
the
difference
between
(a)
and
(b)
is
not
that
it's
orally
versus
in
writing,
it's
that
it's
a
false
financial
statement
case.
an
oral
statement
about
a
financial
condition
would
not
be
covered
at
all
under
(a)
or
(b).
that's
a
category
that's--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--if
i
understand
your
question,
what
would
congress'
motivation
be--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--in
protecting
the
foolish
creditor,
i
think
equitable
principles
that
underlie
the
bankruptcy
code--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
because
there
was
a
pattern
of
abuse
by
consumer
finance
companies
that
congress
identified
as
to
(b),
and
that
was
the
purpose
for
expressly
including
the
elements
of
(b),
materiality
being
one,
reasonable
reliance
being
another,
that
that
would
provide
added
protection
to
debtors
in
that
category,
but
again,
i
think
the
structure
of
the
code
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
provide
that
added
protection
only
in
that
category.
mr.
alan
jenkins
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
respondent's
best
argument,
but
i
think--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
think
it's
not
a
winning
argument,
because
the
term
fraud
does
not
uniformly,
or
even
in
most
cases,
require
mater...
pardon
me,
reasonable
reliance.
mr.
alan
jenkins
yes.
mr.
alan
jenkins
mm-hmm.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
think--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--pardon
me.
mr.
alan
jenkins
may
i
answer?
mr.
alan
jenkins
we
do
think
that
the
obtained-by
fraud
language
requires
causality.
causation,
however,
we
believe
refers
to
actual
reliance.
if
someone
foolishly
relies
on
an
intentionally
false
statement
that
was
intended
to
deceive
the
listener,
then
that
statement
has
caused
the
underlying
debt,
whether
or
not
the
person
happened
to
be
particularly
gullible,
and
that
would
be
particularly
true
if
the
speaker
knew
of
this
frailty
of
the
listener
and
used
that
knowledge
in
order
to
incur
the
debt,
but
certainly
causation
would
be
there,
and
the
obtained-by
language
would
be
satisfied.
mr.
alan
jenkins
thank
you.
