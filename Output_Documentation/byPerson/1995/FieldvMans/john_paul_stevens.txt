paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
field
v.
mans,
number
94-967.
mr.
seufert,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
seufert,
stay
in
front
of
the
microphone
so
we
can
all
hear
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jenkins.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
jenkins.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
whittington.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question:
is
this
language
in
(a)
the
same
language
that
was
in
the
statute
before
1978?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
correct
that
actual
fraud
had
been
thought
to
be
part
of
it
because
of
the...
what's
the
old
case
in
95
u.
s....
there's
a
case
that
your
opponent
cited.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
neal.
neal
was
the
case.
did
not
that
include
actual
fraud
within
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would
it
be
correct
to
say
that
at
least
insofar
as
the
reenactment
of
(a)
is
concerned,
that
was
thought
to
just
be
a
codification
of
existing
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
construing
(a),
we
could
look
at
pre-1978
cases
to
find
out
what
that
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
sort
of
basic
question?
is
it
your
position
that
you
would
have
prevailed
under
pre-1978
law,
or
that...
or
maybe
you
argue
both...
the
change
in
1978
by
the
addition
of
(b)
gives
you
an
argument
that
you
would
not
previously
have
had?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
(b),
the
test
of
satisfying
(b)
is
less
strict
than
the
test
of
satisfying
(a),
or
do
i
have
it
backwards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree,
though,
that
(b)
was
specifically
directed
at
finance
companies
that
relied
on
written
statements
that
they
should
not
reasonably
have
relied
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is,
then,
that
here
there
was
a
duty
to
investigate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
misrepresentation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
allege
there
was
one,
but
do
you...
you
don't
also
agree
it
was
necessary
that
there
be
a
duty
to
investigate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
second?
do
you
think
we
granted
cert
to
decide
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
with
respect
to
issues
bearing
on
the
question
we
did
grant
cert
to
resolve,
did
you
make
this
argument
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
cert
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
whittington.
the
case
is
submitted.
