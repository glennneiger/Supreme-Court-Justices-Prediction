--but
fraud
is
always
an
intentional
tort.
i
thought
you
conceded
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
go
back
in
this
case
before
there
was
any
representation.
suppose
the
debtor
here
had
simply
transferred
that
property
without
saying
one
word
to
the
creditor.
do
i
understand
that
the
debt
would
then
be
dischargeable?
there
would
be
no
representation
at
all,
just
in
violation
of
the
agreement
the
debtor
sells
the
property,
transfers
the
property.
the
creditor
hasn't...
doesn't
know
anything
about
it
till
the
bankrupt...
gets
notice
of
the
bankruptcy
and
finds
out.
dischargeable,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
can
you
explain
to
me
the
consistency
between
saying
that
if
the
debtor
does
something
to
alert
the
creditor,
then
the
debt
will
not
be
discharged,
but
if
he
says
nothing
at
all,
then
it's
going
to
be
discharged?
so
if
he
does
something
that's
helpful
to
the
creditor
at
least
in
raising
a
red
flag,
some
kind
of
alert
that
something's
going
on
in
the
mind
of
the
debtor,
that
maybe
he's
going
to
transfer
this
property,
then
it's
not
dischargeable,
but
if
he
just
goes
ahead
and
does
it,
it
is.
what
sense
does
that
make?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
without
telling
me
whether
it's
fraud
implied
by
law,
the
debt
is
dischargeable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
don't
you
think
that
there's
a
certain
anomaly
between
the
debtor
being
really
bad
and
not
saying
one
word
and
just
doing
it,
and
the
debtor
saying...
giving
some
tipoff
to
the
creditor?
why
should
the
one
be
dischargeable,
that
is,
where...
the
worst
conduct
that
we
can
attribute
to
the
debtor,
saying
nothing,
lead
to
a
dischargeable
debt,
and
if
the
creditor,
the
debtor
has
said
something,
then
it's
not
dischargeable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we're
talking
about
evil.
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
why
this
obligation
was
obtained
by
fraud,
because
your
answer
to
the
question,
if
he
has
the
debt,
the
creditor-debtor
relationship
is
established,
the
debtor
says
nothing
and
just
sells
the
property...
dischargeable.
the
debtor
says
something,
but
still
he
obtained
the
credit
originally
long
before
there
was
any
representation,
so
why
does
this
fit
within
obtained-by
fraud,
the
obtained-by
language?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
fact
nothing
formal
happened,
and
what
happened
is
the
same
thing
as
if
the
debtor
had
said
nothing.
the
due-on-sale
clause
would
have
kicked
in
had
the
creditor
known
about
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
two
situations
where
the
creditor
didn't
know
about
it,
and
everything
remained
the
same.
there
was
no
new
activity,
there
was
no
formal
extension
of
the
debt,
there
was
just
a
debt
obtained
originally
without
regard
to
any
fraud,
and
then
a
continuation
of
that
same
debt
with
no
renewal,
so
i
don't
understand
why
we
would
say
this
debt
was
obtained
by
the
fraud
where
if
the
debtor
had
said
nothing
it
would
not
have
been
obtained
by
the
fraud.
when
we're
looking
at
an
intentional
fraud,
fraud
in
its
purest
sense,
we
have
to
find
it
wasn't
intentional,
because
there
are
some
negligent
frauds,
or
fraudulent
misrepresentations,
negligent
misrepresentation.
there's
a
difference.
if
i...
i
understand
your
question,
if
he
had
done
nothing
in
this
case
and
just
transferred
the
property
and
not
spoken
to
my
client,
not
given
out
deceiving
letters,
it
probably
would
have
been
dischargeable,
judge,
but
we
have
his
intent
to
attempt
to
deceive
by
him
sending
those
letters,
that
i
know
it's
due
on
sale,
and
i
don't
want
to
trigger
it,
therefore
will
you
give
me
consent.
when
the
consent
wasn't
given,
he
did
it
anyways,
and
he
did
it
during
the
course
of
time
when
he's
sending
letters
back
and
forth
to
my
client,
and
that's
the
evilness.
when
there
is
that
evilness,
justice,
you
don't
discharge
a
bad
person,
or
a
bad
debt
in
bankruptcy
against
an
innocent
victim.
mr.
seufert,
your
time
has
expired.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
whittington,
what
about
the
argument
that
you
made
last
in
your
brief
that
i
asked
your
adversary
about.
you
say
that
this,
in
any
event
all
of
this
is
academic,
because
the
credit
here
was
not
obtained
by
the
fraud,
so
whether
there's
a
requirement
of
reasonable
reliance
or
justifiable
reliance
is
beside
the
point
if
the
credit
wasn't
obtained
by
the
fraud.
