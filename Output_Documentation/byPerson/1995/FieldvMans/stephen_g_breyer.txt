justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
hasn't
it
always
been
the
law
that
under
fraud
you
have
to
show
the
reliance
was
justifiable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
word
they
use,
and
i
never
heard
in
this
whole
case,
anywhere,
anybody
until
now,
making
a
distinction
between
reasonable
and
justifiable.
as
i
read
the
first
circuit
opinion
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
and
everything,
they
were
all
using
the
term
reasonable
to
mean
the
same
thing.
in
other
words,
do
you
lose,
then,
if
i
think
it's
the
same?
if
i
think
all
they
meant
was
it
had
to
be
justifiable
reliance,
then
you
lose
the
case?
i
mean,
i
thought
there
was
this:
you
know,
i
go
out
and
i
say,
hey,
will
you
lend
me
a
million
dollars?
you
say,
have
you
any
security?
i
say,
sure.
i'll
give
you
the
isle
of
elba.
i'm
napoleon--
[laughter]
okay?
now,
if
you're
so
stupid
as
to
rely
on
that,
totally
unreasonable,
unjustifiable,
i'm
very
sorry,
you
lose.
i
mean,
that's
what
i
thought
the
law
was.
whether
they
called
it
unjustifiable,
unreasonable,
it
didn't
make
that
much
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
may
be
some
cases
that
say
it's
different.
i'm
just
saying,
as
i've
read
these
cases,
i
think
that
the
other
side
won't
mind
if
we
were
to
say,
okay,
what
is
necessary
here
is
that
the...
to
be
dischargeable
you
have
to
show
that
it
was
unjustified
reliance...
do
you
see
what
i
mean
+/?
where
they
use
the
word
unjustified
instead
of
reasonable.
i'm
not
following.
is
this
because
napoleon
did
not
own
the
isle
of
elba?
[laughter]
that's
right.
very
few
people
know
he
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't...
my
problem
is,
i
don't
understand
these
technical
words,
and
i
usually
try
to
interpret
them
in
ways
that
aren't
that
technical,
and
as
i
read
through
these
briefs,
i
thought
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
a
requirement
in
section
(a)
that
the
person
who
is
the
victim
have
to
have
behaved
reasonably
or
justifiably
in
the
circumstance.
i
didn't
think
there
was
that
big
a
difference
between
the
two,
and
although
judge
cyr...
i
think
it
was
judge
cyr,
is
that
right
+/?
said...
well,
said
reasonable
and
unreasonable,
i
thought
i
would
have
reached
the
same
result
if
he
used
the
word
justifiable
and
unjustifiable.
now,
for
the
first
time
i'm
hearing
something
different,
and
it
probably
is
my
fault,
not
focusing
on
it,
but
i'd
like
to
get
you
to
focus
on
that
and
why
it
makes
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
didn't
know
at
that
time,
i
take
it,
what
the
courts
were
going
to
hold
about
this
thing,
about...
there
was
some
split,
i
gather,
and
the
finance
companies
came
in
to
them
and
said
a
lot
of
people
make
these
representations
in
writing,
and
we
want
to
be
certain
there's
reasonable
reliance,
the
consumer
group
said.
i
mean,
they
had
that
before
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
possible
sense
could
it
make
to
say,
if
i
go
in
writing,
and
i
use
my
napoleon
example...
you
know,
it's
a
surrogate
for
any
ridiculous
thing,
where
you're
being
very
unreasonable.
i
do
it
in
writing,
and
you
agree,
if
you're
so
silly
as
to
rely
on
this
statement,
you
can't
recover,
because
it
falls
under
(b).
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
could
congress
have
in
mind
if
i
do
exactly
the
same
thing,
but
i
happen
to
say
it
orally,
and
you're
so
silly
as
to
rely
on
that
statement.
then,
however,
i
can't
be
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
what
could
be
the
theory
of
such
a
thing?
what
could
be
the
theory
that
wouldn't
explain,
well,
they
changed
(b)
because
they
focused
on
(b)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
change
(a)--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
nobody
asked
them
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean,
in
other
words,
they
want
to
protect
this
very,
very
foolish
creditor,
the
very
foolish
lender,
like
general
motors
access
corporation
or
something.
i
mean,
they
want
to
protect
these
very
foolish
lenders
where
the
debtor
comes
and
says
something
orally
but
not
in
writing,
and
my
only
question
is,
why
would
that
be?
i
don't
know
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--same
question.
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
why
in
the
one
and
not
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
do
we
have
to
get
into
that?
do
we
have
to
get
into
a
duty
to
investigate?
i
mean,
i
thought
here...
you
try
these
things,
do
you,
quite
a
lot?
are
you
involved
in
bankruptcy
cases
quite--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
all
right
then.
i
was...
my
imaginative
idea
of
this
is
the
fellow
comes
up
and
he
says,
well,
i
know
that
there
was
somebody
else
out
here
who
claimed
to
be
the
owner
of
the
property,
and
i
know
that
if
the
other
guy
is
the
owner
of
the
property,
i
should
have
called
in
this
debt
immediately.
i
know
both
of
those
things,
but
still
i
relied
on
some
letter
written
3
years
ago
that
said,
i
won't...
it
didn't
even
said
that.
it
said,
i
haven't
sold
the
property
yet.
i
haven't
transferred
it
yet.
so
you'd
say,
you
didn't
rely
on
that.
that's
ridiculous.
he
says,
yes,
i
did.
so
okay,
if
you're
that
stupid,
you
lose
anyway.
i
mean,
that's
how
i
imagine
this
case
going.
is...
do
you
see
what
i'm
trying
to...
what
is
the
practicality
of
it?
