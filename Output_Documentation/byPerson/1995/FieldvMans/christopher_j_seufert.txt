mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
common
law
of
fraud:
justice
easterbrook
in
his
opinion
in
the
matter
of
mayer
stated,
an
intentional
deceit
concerning
a
material
proposition
is
fraud
whether
or
not
a
more
alert
target
would
have
smelled
a
rat,
as
victims
of
intentional
torts
need
not
take
special
precautions.
under
the
common
law
as
laid
out
in
the
restatement
of
torts
section
545(a),
a
plaintiff's
reliance
on
an
intentional
fraud
must
only
be
justifiable.
his
conduct
does
not
have
to
conform
to
that
of
a
reasonable
man,
because
fraud
is
an
intentional
tort.
the
victim
of
such
is
not
required
to
exercise
the
care
of
a
reasonable
man,
just
that
of
a
reasonable
victim.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
yes,
justice
o'connor.
justifiable
does
not
equate
with
reasonable,
and
the
common
law
spells
out
the
difference
between
the
two.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
there
has
to
be
a
requirement
of
materiality,
because
the
elements
of
false
pretenses,
false
representations,
or
actual
fraud,
are
not
laid
out
in
523(a)(2)(a).
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
there
has
to
be
materiality,
and
the
reason--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
because
fraud
is
an
intentional
crime.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
correct,
and
the
reason
that
is
so
is
that
a
balancing
act
is
done
in
the
common
law
between
the
culpability
of
a
defendant
versus
the
culpability
of
his
victim.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
they
are,
justice...
may
i
explain
+/?
similar
to
a
shell
game.
if
you
were
to
be
walking
in
a
common
or
a
park,
and
there
were
to
be
a
gentleman
there,
and
he
has
three
cups
out.
if
we
were
talking
about
false
representations,
the
person
who
is
going
to
be
running
the
shell
game
would
tell
you
that
i
have
put
the
nut
in
the
middle
cup.
let's
play
the
game.
you
can't
win,
because
he
hasn't
put
the
nut
in
the
cup.
the
cups
are
empty.
but
he
tells
you
the
nut's
there,
and
he
has
you
play.
he
tells
you.
he
makes
a
false
representation.
false
pretenses.
say,
for
instance,
the
same
scenario,
we
have
the
same
three
cups,
you
walk
along
in
the
park,
and
he's
there.
he
doesn't
tell
you
there's
no
nut
in
the
cups,
but
he
has
the
three
cups
out,
and
he
says,
let's
play.
he
puts
those
facts
in
place
to
lead
you
to
the
pretence
that
he's
going
to
play
the
game
honestly
and
that
there's
a
nut.
you
still
can't
win,
because
there's
no
nut,
but
he
hasn't
misrepresented
fraudulently.
he's...
by
false
pretenses,
by
subterfuge.
actual
fraud
would
be
that
he
takes
the
nut,
has
the
three
cups,
you
walk
along,
he
puts
it
in
the
cup,
and
then
by
a
flick
of
the
wrist
takes
the
nut
back
out,
so
he
actually
does
something,
an
overt
act.
three
types
of
fraud.
each
one
of
them
has
the
scienter
of
intent.
he's
intending
to
defraud
you
one
of
three
ways.
you
still
can't
win
the
game
because
the
fraud's
there,
and
fraud
has
to
be
intentional
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
this
court--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--the
reliance
must
be
justifiable
if
it's
an
intentional
fraud,
because
there's...
there's
fraud--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
and
the
reason
it
must
be
justifiable
is
because
there
has
to
be
some
materiality
under
the
common
law
between
the
fraud
and
the
loss
of
the
victim.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
i
believe
the
case
of
matter
of
weinstein,
page
809,
describes
the
differences
between
the
false
representations
and
false
pretenses.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
page
809
of
the
matter
of
weinstein,
31
bankruptcy
reporter,
504,
a
1983
case,
justice.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
1983.
i
believe
it's
cited
in
our
joint
appendix.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
it's
dealing
with
the
difference
between
false
pretenses
and
false
representation.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
within
the
meaning
of.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
there's
the
very
old
u.
s.
supreme
court
case
of
neal
v.
smith
that's
cited
also
in
the
joint
appendix.
what
that
case
concerns
is
that
the
fraud
must
be
fraud,
an
intentional
fraud,
not
that
implied
by
law,
because
there
is
some
implicit
fraud
implied
by
law.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
justice,
there
can
be
fraud
implied
by
law.
new
hampshire
and
many
other
states
have
a
fraudulent
conveyances
act,
which
means
that
if
you
sell
property
or
give
away
property
for
less
than
fair
value
when
you
are
about
to
be
sued,
or
about
to
incur
debts,
that
the
state
law
considers
that's
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
even
though
you
had
no
intent
to
be
fraudulent,
you
were
making
a
gift.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
while
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
agree
with
you,
it
would
be
dischargeable.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
if
i
can
maybe
explain,
if
the
property
would
have
had
to
have
been
transferred
without
any
notification
or
any
back
and
forth
correspondence,
that
would
be
fraud
under
the
fraudulent
conveyances
act
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
however,
that
would
be
fraud
implied
by
law,
so
we
would
have--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--it
would
be
dischargeable,
but
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
if
my...
i
mean,
we
could
assume
that
my
client
would
have
found
out
through
some
other
means,
perhaps,
that
the
transfer--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--it
may
not
have
been
a
tipoff,
justice,
if
i
may
explain.
the
letters...
if
you
want
to
get
into
a
particular
fact,
the
letter
that
went
out
to
my
client
says,
we
know
about
the
due-on-sale,
and
we
do
not
want
to
trigger
it,
therefore
we
want
your
consent,
making
a
representation
that
they
knew
and
wouldn't
violate
that
section,
and
subsequently
they
did
violate
that
section
when
they
sent
that
letter
out,
and
the
trial
court
said
that
was
fraud.
that
was
false
pretenses,
so
that
was
fraud.
if
the
letter...
if
the
letter
had
not
gone
out
and
there
was
no
representation,
well,
i
know
about
it
and
i
don't
want
to
violate
it,
we'd
have
a
tougher...
tougher
case
here
before
this
court.
those
aren't
the
facts,
though,
because
we
have
the
actual
fraud
taking
place
at
the
time,
and
there
was
a
finding
of
the
fraud.
but
the
trial
court
turned
on
that
we
needed
reasonable
reliance.
the
trial
court
in
the
appendix,
pages
43
and
44,
a
party...
this
was
the
trial
court's
findings:
a
party
is
not
entitled,
you
know,
to
be
in
good
faith
and
just
not
objectively
reasonable.
an
objective
reasonable
man
standard
applies.
that
would
be
the
standard.
if
we're
using
this
balancing
act
and
we're
looking
at
negligent
representation
under
the
law
versus
intentional
representation,
because
the
law
does
this
balancing
act,
and
if
there's
intent,
scienter,
bad
intent,
evil
intent
on
behalf
of
the
perpetrator,
then
the
law
protects
the
victim
by
saying,
okay,
you
don't
have
to
prove
the
reasonableness,
you
just
have
to
prove
that
you,
in
good
faith,
did
rely--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
the
fosco
case,
your
honor--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--justice
breyer,
there
must
be
a
material
nexus
between--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--there
must
be
a
material
nexus
between
the
fraud
and
the
loss.
if
the
reliance
is
so
far-fetched
that
it
couldn't
even
be
justifiable,
if
napoleon
did
not
own
the
isle
of
elba
and
everybody
knew
it...
everybody
knew
it...
then--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--in
our
brief,
your
honor,
we
pointed
out
that
contributory
negligence
is
not
a
defense
when
you
have
an
intentional
tort.
when
congress
wrote
the
two
sections
523(a)(2)(a)
and
(a)(2)(b),
you
can
see
a
clear
distinction
that
congress
made
by
including
in
523(a)(2)(b)
that
even
if
the
victim
proves
reasonable
reliance,
he
also
must
prove
intent
to
deceive.
he
has
to
prove
those
two
elements,
the
intent
and
reasonable.
that
is
a
departure
from
the
common
law,
which
says
if
you
prove
the
evil
intent,
you
don't
have
to
prove
reasonable
reliance.
you
only
have
to
prove
subjective,
justifiable
reliance.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
i
believe
we
had
the
example--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
did
put
the
example
in
our
brief
regarding
the,
if
you
say
you
own
the
property
and
you're
going
to
give
me
a
mortgage,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
mortgage
and
you
own
the
property
outright,
there's
no
mortgage...
or
if
there
is
a
mortgage...
i
could
have
checked
on
it
by
going
right
next
door
to
the
registry
and
saying,
looking
it
up,
and
looking
it
up
and
find
that
there
was
a
mortgage,
but
i
believed
you.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
i'm
not
good
on
answering--
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
--well,
there
is
no
duty
to
investigate
if
you
prove
evil
intent,
the
evil
empire,
on
the
perpetrator
of
the
fraud.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
the
extension
of
credit
is
what
we
relied
upon
before
the
trial
court,
because
there
is
a...
there
was
a
due-on-sale
clause
that
called
forward
not
only
the
original
note
but
front-loaded
all
of
the
interest
that
this
mortgage
was
supposed
to
pay
out
over
its
next
10
years
immediately
up
front
if
the
property
was
transferred
without
a
written
consent
for
transfer.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
seufert
thank
you,
your
honor.
