david
h.
souter
what
about
reliance?
does
the
reliance
have
to
be
justifiable
with
respect
to
the
false
pretence
and
the
false
representation
claim
at
common
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
each
of
these...
you
have
just
described
each
of
these
as
intentional,
haven't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
saying
that
at
common
law
there
must
be
a
justifiable
reliance
in
each
of
the
three
categories,
not
just
fraud,
but
the
representation
and
pretense.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
a
question
which
goes
to
this
distinction?
i
don't
have
the
quotations
from
the
restatement
literally
in
front
of
me,
but
they're
in
the
briefs.
i
thought
one
distinction,
and
i
think
this
is
raised
by
your
contributory
negligence
point,
is
that
there
is
no
duty
to
investigate
under
a
justifiable
reliance
standard,
but
there
may
be
under
a
reasonable
reliance
standard,
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
why,
if
you
should
have
investigated
but
didn't,
it's
not
imputed
against
you
as
contributory
negligence.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
in
the
island
of
elba
example,
i
suppose
there
would
be
neither
justifiable
nor
reasonable
reliance.
justice
david
h.
souter
everybody
knows
that
he
doesn't
look
like
napoleon,
at
least
i
think
he
doesn't
look
like
napoleon--
[laughter]
--but...
and
napoleon
is
dead,
and
justice
breyer
is
very
lively,
but
once
you
get
out
of
such
an
obvious
example,
then
your
distinction
between
the
duty
to
investigate
and
no
duty
to
investigate
would...
could
make
a
crucial
difference
and
i
suppose
you...
of
course
you
would
argue
that
it
does
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
difference
here
that
the
word
fraud
occurs
in
a
series,
and
the
other
two
terms
in
the
series
are
obviously
common
law
terms?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
there's
no
definition
of
them
anywhere
in
the
statute,
which
is
a
pretty
good
indication
that
there
is
a
reference
to
some
place
else,
and
the
some
place
else
is
state
common
law,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i
should
know
this,
but
how
do
we
know
that
congress
looked
to
that
case?
is
that
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
it
could...
i'm
sorry.
go
on.
or
it
could
simply
have
had
a
separate
section
and
said,
if
it's
a
representation
about
financial
condition,
it's
going
to
be
in
writing,
and
that's
all
it
would
have
done.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
whittington,
what
is
your
authority
for
these
distinctions?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
it's
common
law
case
law,
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
we
look
at
neal,
what
do
we
find
about
reliance?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
the
pre-'78
common
law
cases,
how
do
you
account
for
what
seems
to
be
a
disparity
of
standards
between
the
cases
that
you
rely
on
and
the
restatement,
because
i
take
it
the
restatement,
in
talking
about
justifiable
reliance,
really
is
talking
about
a
less
strict
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
conceding,
i
guess,
then,
to
the
extent
that
you
are
basing
your
discussion
on
the
ninth
circuit,
that
there
is
at
least
some
distinction
to
be
made
between
reasonable
and
justifiable.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
you?
what
do
you
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong.
the
factors
should
be
exactly
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
as
you've--
justice
david
h.
souter
--argued
them,
but
so
far
as
the
legal
standard
is
concerned,
you're
taking
a
different
position
from
the
ninth
circuit.
you're
saying
they're
identical.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
say
that
with
respect
to
the
duty
to
investigate.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
duty
to
investigate
is
always
the
same
on
each
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
there
is,
it
will
be
the
same
whether
we're
talking
justifiable
or
reasonable.
