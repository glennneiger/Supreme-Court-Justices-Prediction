mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
intend
first
to
address
the
issues
raised
by
justice
o'connor
and
justice
souter
as
to
the
differences
between
false
pretenses
and
the
other
two
in
the
threesome
in
523(a)(2)(a),
and
then
to
deal
with
the
subject
of
whether
in
fact
in
false
pretenses
reasonableness
has
been
required,
and
then
to
deal
with
justice
breyer's
question
concerning
difference,
if
any,
between
reasonable
and
justifiable.
if
there's
more
time
after
those
subjects,
i
will
address
other
aspects
of
the
plain
meaning
in
the
legislative
history.
we
believe
that
there
are
actually
differences
between
false
pretenses
and
the
second
two
in
the
triumvirate.
that
is,
false
pretenses
is
where
there
never
was
an
intention
to
pay
the
debt
at
all,
whereas
in
false
statement,
or
false
representation,
or
actual
fraud,
there
may
have
been
an
intention
to
pay
the
debt,
but
there
was
a
misrepresentation
as...
usually
to
security.
obviously,
false
pretenses
can
be
included
in
the
second
category,
and
the
typical
false
pretenses
cases
are
the
credit
card
cases,
where,
for
example,
the
borrower
has
already
maxed
out
his
credit
card,
and
so
the
argument
is
made
that
at
the
time
you
incurred
this
debt,
you
had
absolutely
no
intention
of
repaying
it
at
all,
as
opposed
to
the
typical
actual
fraud
case,
where
the
argument
is,
where
you
intended
to
pay
it,
but
you
fudged
a
little
on
what
your
means
were
as
to
whether
you
were
able
to.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
have
five
cases
that
make
these
distinctions.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
yes,
it
is.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
bankruptcy
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
do
agree
with
that,
and
in
fact
i
looked
for
some
and
was
unable
to
find
them.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
yes,
it
is,
with
one
minor
difference,
and
that
is
the
third
of
the
threesome,
actual
fraud,
was
added,
and
most
courts
that
have
addressed
that--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--neal,
u.
s....
neal--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
can't
answer
the
question
with
respect
to
neal,
your
honor,
but
with
respect
to
other
pre-'78
cases,
which
we've
cited
at
page
15
of
our
brief
in
footnote
13,
there
are,
i
believe,
at
least
three
cases
in
the
1970
to
1978
timeframe
which
did,
in
fact,
require
reasonable
reliance
as
to
523(a)(2)(a).
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
we
would
have
prevailed
under
both,
in
our
view.
that
is,
(a)
23
(a)(2)(a)
in
the
prior
version
did,
in
fact,
include
actual
fraud,
actual
reasonable
reliance,
whereas
what
was
then
(b),
the
second
part
of
old
17(a)(2),
the
cases
split,
and
in
order
to
strengthen
the
(b)
part
with
respect
to
written
financial
statements,
congress
added
the
word,
reasonableness,
to
clarify
it.
in
fact,
the
government's
brief
in
footnote
12
at
pages
12
and
13
makes
this
very
point,
i
believe.
reading
from
the
line
that
starts
on
page
12
and
goes
to
13,
"in
any
event,
congress
clearly
concluded
that
any
judicial
trend
toward
a
proof
of
reasonable
reliance
requirement
in
financial
statement
cases
was
not
so
well
established
as
to
obviate
the
need
for
express
inclusion
of
the
requirement.
"
i
think
that
shows
the
congressional
intent
that
they
wanted
to
make
what
is
now
(b)
just
as
strong
as
what
now
is
now
(a).
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
the
distinction
between
justifiable
and
reasonable,
which
is
the
question
that
justice
breyer
raised,
we
believe
that
it's
the
same
in
both.
the
principal
case
which
has
used
the
term
justifiable
as
opposed
to
reasonable
is
the
kirsh
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
which
in
reality
was
a
1-1-1
split.
the
majority
opinion
said
that
justifiable
was
different,
and
there
were
two
votes
for
that.
the
third
position
was
that
reasonableness
was
all
that
was
required,
and
then,
splitting
the
other
way,
two
justices
said
that,
whichever
word
it
is,
it
was
either
reasonable
or
justifiable.
the
explanation
given
by
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
justifiable
includes
reasonableness
plus
other
factors,
that
reasonableness
is
only
"one
of
the
factors
in
the
mix.
"
and
our
position
is,
if
we
look
at
the
various
potential
factors
in
the
mix,
they
could
include
whether
the
lender
is
alerted
by
some
fact,
as
in
our
situation,
and/or
whether
the
creditor
had
a
duty
to
investigate.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
other
courts
have
disagreed
with
that,
and--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--i
think
it's
the
same
both
ways.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
if
the
ninth
circuit
was
right,
our
position
would
still
be
that
there
was
justifiable
reliance--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--that's
correct.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
that's
correct,
and
in
fact--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--that's
correct.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
well,
there
may
not
be
a
duty
to
investigate.
it
may
depend--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--that's
correct,
and
that's
the
point
of
the
mayer
case,
i
believe.
the
mayer
case
says,
in
the
first
instance,
there's
no
duty
to
nose
out
the
truth.
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
but
an
investor
or
a
lender
cannot
close
his
eyes
to
known
risks,
to
known
information.
that,
in
our
view,
is,
in
fact,
the
reliance-balancing
which
is
necessary.
it's
a
factual
determination
of
the
factfinder
which
can
be
affirmed
either
direction
that
it
goes
on
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
and
so
in
our
view
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
correct,
in
terms
of
semantics,
that
they
choose
justifiable
instead
of
reasonable.
either
way,
it
should
be
the
process
of
balancing
those
factors.
i
might
add
that
the
ninth
circuit
also
points
to
the
fact
that
in
california
the
listing
of
the
common
law
elements
of
fraud
uses
justifiable,
which
they
take
out
of
prosser
in
the
second
restatement,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
majority
opinion
in
kirsh
looks
to
the
language
justifiable
as
opposed
to
reasonable.
now,
turning
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
petitioners
say
that--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--written.
written
financial
statements.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
in
other
words,
our
view
is--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
in
other
words,
our
view
is
the
reason
that
congress
took
the
trouble
to
list
out
the
elements,
to
give
us
a
laundry
list,
as
you
were,
in
section
(b),
is
because
they've
changed
the
common
law
in
two
ways:
writing,
and
financial
statements.
other
than
those
two
factors,
they
exactly
track
the
common
law,
in
our
view,
which
is
why
there
was
no
need
to
list
out
the
elements
in
523(a)(2)(a).
instead,
they
could
simply
give
us
legal
shorthand,
if
you
were,
a
common
law
definition,
which
to
lawyers
with
long
jurisprudence
connotes
all
those
subsidiary
elements
in
it.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
no.
i
think
that
they're
equally
strict,
and
in
the
'70
to
'78
case
period
under
the
prior
law,
there
was
some
disagreement
as
to
that.
that
is,
some
courts
were
construing
(b)
as
being
less
strict,
and
congress
was
concerned
about
that,
so
to
clarify
that,
that
they
didn't
want
(b)
less
strict,
they
threw
in
the
word
reasonableness
to
clarify
it,
so
our
position
is
that
(a)
and
(b)
are
both
equally
strict
with
respect
to
reliance.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
think
the
tightening
up
of
the
statute
was
specifically
directed
at
that.
in
fact,
judge
berry
gave
testimony
to
the
house
subcommittee
that
considered
this,
in
which
he
delivered
to
them
a
decision
in
a
case
where
there
was
no
reasonableness,
and
he
had
ruled
that
therefore
there
was
no
fraud,
and
his
view
was
that
that
was
not
appropriate.
and
then
in
the
language
that's
been
quoted
by
both
the
petitioners
and
the
solicitor
general,
congress
in
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
states
that
it's
concerned
about
finance
companies
who
might
even
encourage
lenders
to
leave
something
out.
what
judge
berry
gave
to
them
was
the
actual
forms
that
didn't
even
leave
enough
room
to
put
the
information
on
there,
which
was
one
of
the
abuses
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
don't
think
so.
this
is
a--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--this
is
a
chapter
7
liquidation
case,
so
if
we
were
under
a
different
chapter,
perhaps,
but
certainly
not
in
this
case.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
no,
i
don't
think
so
either,
because
there's
a
discharge
as
of
the
date...
the
debtor
would
have
to
pay
out
of
future
acquired
assets,
i'm
guessing,
so
i
think
the
answer
is
no
again.
finally,
as
to
the
plain
language,
and
why
i
believe
that
(a)
is
simply
a
laundry
list,
legal
shorthand,
is
the
fact
that
several
justices
have
pointed
out
each
of
the
other
normal
elements
of
the
common
law
fraud
action,
although
not
expressly
stated
in
(a),
are
read
into
(a),
and
i
cite
the
court
to
pages
12
and
13
of
the
respondent's
brief...
let
me
just
confirm
that...
which
list
several
cases
at
the
circuit
court
level
that
have
read
those
requirements
in.
we're
not
aware
of
any
cases
that
have
refused
to
read
those
elements
in.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
don't
agree
with
your
honor.
i
think
that
mr.
mans
should
win
in
either
event,
because
whether
the
term
reasonable
is
used,
or
justifiable,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it
wasn't
possible
for
field
to
be
either
one.
in
fact,
the
court
will
recall
that
in
this
case
mr.
field
had
actual
knowledge
that
a
mr.
defelice
was
on
the
property
claiming
to
be
the
owner,
and
that
was
the
alleged
implicitness
representation.
that's
the
term
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
was
that
mr.
mans
had
implied
that
he
hadn't
transferred
it,
and
our
view
is,
whether
you
use...
whether
the
court
would
use
reasonable
or
justifiable,
it's
neither
one
for
mr.
field
to
simply
do
nothing,
not
even
ask
mr.
mans
when
he
sees
him
on
numerous
occasions,
golly,
is
it
correct
that
you've
transferred
the
property
to
mr.
defelice.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
not
initially.
that
duty
to--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--that's
correct.
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
no.
i
think
that
once
he
became
aware
of
facts
which
called
into
question
the
representation,
then
a
duty
arose.
now,
i'm
engaging
right
now
in
factual
determinations,
which
is
not
the
appropriate
thing
for
us
to
be
doing
at
this
court,
but
that's
the
thought
process
that
the
trier
of
fact,
the
bankruptcy
judge
in
this
case,
should
be
undertaking.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
agree.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
agree.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
well,
i
have
not
tried
a
lot
of
these.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
our
view
is,
those
are
all
factors
in
the
mix
to
be
considered
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
as
an
advocate
at
the
trial
court
level,
those
are
the
facts
that
i'm
playing
with.
those
are
the
facts
that
i'm
trying
to
establish,
that
the
creditor
was
on
notice,
that
the
creditor
maybe
was
sophisticated,
that
the
creditor
maybe
is
required
by
federal
law
to
do
certain
investigations
and
has
failed
to
do
that
if
it's
a
bank,
that
the
creditor
had
a
special
relationship
with
the
debtor
that
would
cause
him
to
normally
undertake
an
investigation...
as
an
advocate
at
the
trial
court
level,
those
are
all
factors
in
the
mix
which
i
would
be
trying
to
urge
on
the
factfinder.
but
the
question
before
the
court,
in
our
judgment,
is,
should
the
factfinder
be
engaging
in
that
analysis,
and
to
that
answer...
to
that
question,
the
answer
has
to
be
yes,
in
our
view.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
i
welcome
that
question.
this
was
an
issue
that
absolutely
slipped
through,
perhaps
because
mr.
mans
was
unrepresented
below,
but
under
the
clear
language
of
the
statute,
there
has
to
be
an
extension
of
credit
in
connection
with
the
fraud.
it
has
to
be
obtained
by
the
fraud,
and
we
have
a
4-month
gap
here.
the
money
is
out,
all
of
the
money,
$187,000--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--no,
i
don't.
that's
why--
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
--there
was
no
brief
in
opposition
filed.
i
was
not
yet
retained,
and
mr.
mans
was
unrepresented
at
that
point.
mr.
w.
e.
whittington,
iv
next,
i
would
like
to
address
the
collateral
estoppel
issue,
which
hasn't
been
spoken
about
here
today.
this
court
stated
in
1991
in
the
grogan
v.
garner
case
that
collateral
estoppel
principles
are
important,
particularly
in
section
523(a)(2)(a)
cases.
in
grogan,
of
course,
you
decided
that
the
appropriate
standard
of
proof
was
preponderance
as
opposed
to
clear
and
convincing,
and
the
reason
that
the
court
gave
that...
decided
that
was
so
that
collateral
estoppel
principles
would
be
furthered
between
state
or
federal
court
actions
and
the
bankruptcy
court
actions.
under
the
same
analysis,
in
order
for
collateral
estoppel
to
work,
there
needs
to
be
the
same
grouping
of
factors
in
the
two
types
of
cases,
and
in
fact
there
are
situations
where
a
case
may
go
to
trial
first
in
the
state
court,
let's
say,
on
a
common
law
fraud
action,
by
which
it's
determined...
by
which
the
debtor
prevails,
let's
say,
because
there
was
no
reasonable
reliance,
and
then
some
months
later,
after
there's
a
filing
in
bankruptcy,
there
is
an
inconsistent
ruling
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
or
it
could
be
the
other
way
around,
if
the
bankruptcy
ruling
under
523(a)(2)(a)
could
be
determined
first,
and
there
be
an
inconsistent
result
the
other
direction
later
in
state
or
federal
court.
finally,
i'd
like
to
address
a
subject
that
was
mentioned,
i
believe
by
justice
scalia,
which
is
the
role
that
the
reliance
element
really
plays,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
it
is
the
principal
tool
of
the
factfinder
in
determining
whether
there's
actual
causation,
a
link
between
the
misrepresentation
on
the
one
side
and
the
action
taken
by
the
creditor
on
the
other.
that
language
is
expressly
picked
up
by
the
kirsh
case,
quoting
prosser,
and
that's
the
reason
that
it's
important
for
this
court,
in
our
judgment,
to
maintain
the
reliance
requirement
so
that
in
fact
judicial
