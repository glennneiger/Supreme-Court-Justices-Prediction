chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
94-1361,
marjorie
zicherman
v.
korean
air
lines,
and
a
companion
case.
mr.
needham.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
be
perfectly...
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
sounds
fine.
adequate
compensation
sounds
fine,
but
what
you're
saying
is,
in
effect,
we
put
a
thumb
on
the
scale,
that,
you
know,
if
you
have
an
interpretation
that
perhaps
is
evenly
balanced
between
a
narrower
and
a
broader
one
favoring
plaintiffs,
you
favor
the
broader
one.
why
on
earth
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
the
treaty
says.
i
mean,
there's
no
doubt
or
alternate
constructions
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
cap
isn't
involved
here,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
follows
what
else
you're
saying,
that
apparently
the
sky
is
the
limit,
regardless
of
language
and
that
sort
of
thing,
that
you
just
bend
every
effort
to
maximize
the
plaintiff's
recovery.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
citation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
needham--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--alves
was
not
a
court
opinion,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
if
you'll
look
again
you'll
see
it's
only
a
plurality
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
shackled
by
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act?
why
don't
you
use
a
neutral
phrase
such
as
governed?
i
mean,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
an
act
of
congress,
just
like
numerous
other
statutes
are,
and
to
refer
to
you
as
being
shackled,
i
don't...
i
mean,
that's
a
very
pejorative--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
needham.
mr.
harakas,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
plaintiffs
here
were
americans.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harakas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
needham,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
needham.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94-1361,
zicherman
versus
korean
airlines
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
