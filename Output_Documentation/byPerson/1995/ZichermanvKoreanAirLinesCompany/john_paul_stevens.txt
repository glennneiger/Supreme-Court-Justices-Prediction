justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
right
there,
because
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
ask
your
opponent,
but
the...
assuming
the
treaty
doesn't
speak
for
itself,
we
have
to
go
behind
the
treaty
to
look
at
some
other
law,
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
read
the
papers
in
this
case
that
both
of
you
seemed
to
assume
that
we
do
look
to
american
law,
to
united
states
law
for
the
answers,
and
i
just
wonder
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
the
fact
that
it's
american
forum
that
really
controls
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
may
i
ask,
just
to
get
one
thought
sorted
out
in
my
mind,
here,
under
american
law,
your
argument
is
the
death
occurred
on
the
high
seas,
so
the
statute...
the
statute
applies.
if
the
death
had
occurred,
say,
in
flight
over
california
instead
of
on
the
high
seas,
would
you
then
contend...
would
it
be
california
law
that
would
apply
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
true
if
it
also
occurred
over
territorial
waters.
you'd
say
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
governs
even
though
it
would
not
govern
if
it
had
been
a
ship
in
territorial
waters.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you...
but
if
i
understand
your
argument
correctly,
you
do
say
there
should
be
one
uniform
federal
rule
that
applies
not
only
to
high
seas
but
to
territorial
waters
and
to
accidents
over
land,
and
if
that's
so,
i
just
don't
quite
understand
why
that
should
be...
if
there
is
a
uniform
law,
why
we
aren't
free
to
choose
between
the
alternatives.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
it's
just
sort
of
an
accident,
this
happens
to
be
a
high
seas
case,
so
we'll
take
that
standard,
and
then
we
later
on
say,
we've
got
to
have
uniformity,
so
we
would
extend
the
coverage
of
that
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we
started
out
saying
we
have
to
have
uniformity,
then
we
might
have
a
lot
of
different
alternatives
to
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
american--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
are
you
finished
with
your...
may
i
ask
this
question?
it
just...
we
think...
we
tend
to
think
of
international
air
crashes
like
this
as
almost
always
occurring
over
the
high
seas,
because
of
all
the
international
flights,
but
at
the
time
the
convention
was
adopted,
is
it
not
true
that
the
typical
case
would
be
one
flying
between
different
countries,
and
the
action
would
be
most
apt
to
occur
over
land?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
there
wasn't
an
awful
lot
of
air
carriers
flying
across
the
atlantic
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
already
was
substantial
international
commerce
over
land.
justice
john
paul
stevens
over
the
channel,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
people
who
are
guilty
of
the
wilful
misconduct
were
the
flight
crew,
weren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
flight
crew,
i
suppose
they
have
a
pretty
good
deterrent
whatever
the
damages
are.
