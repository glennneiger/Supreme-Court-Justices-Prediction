justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
other
side
use
the
word.
why,
actually...
i
want
to
get
your
point,
but
i
mean,
if
i
had
started
back...
it
gets
a
little
depressing,
frankly.
there
isn't
much
damage
here.
it's
12
years
later.
there
isn't
a
lot
of
money
in
the
case,
so
i
guess
if
i'd
gone
back
to
page
1,
i
would
have
looked
at
this
article
17,
which
strikes
me
as
totally
ambiguous,
and
i
would
have
asked
whether
or
not
there
are
other
cases
over
the
last
75
years
where
somebody
decided
what
law
applied,
and
i
take
it
the
answer
to
that's
none,
right...
never
decided.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
in
the
world.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay,
so
you
say
the
answer's
none,
all
right,
except
one
that
you
think
is
on
your
side
here,
which
i
don't,
but
nonetheless,
i'm
trying
to
get--
--that's
not
true,
though.
there
are
a
number
of
other
cases
in
other
jurisdictions,
almost
all
of
which,
except
the
english
case,
come
out
the
other
way,
don't
they?
they
apply
local
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
they
didn't
settle,
or
you
couldn't
reach
a
settlement,
or
whatever.
okay.
now,
my
question
is
really
justice
o'connor's.
i
then
go
to
article
24.
this
would
all
happen
12
years
ago.
twelve
years
ago
we'd
look
to
article
24.
it
seems
to
say
that
you
apply
the
local
law.
that's
what
it
seems
to
say.
i
grant
you
it's
a
little
ambiguous,
but
i
would
have
thought
at
least
there's
a
chance
you'd
apply
local
law.
and
at
that
point
i'd
ask,
what
does
a
court
in
the
united
states
do,
and
i
guess
the
first
question
that
a
court
in
the
united
states
would
have
under,
were
there
never
any
warsaw
treaty,
would
be,
oh,
i
have
an
accident
in
the
sea
of
japan
with
a
korean
airplane
shot
down
by
some
russians,
and
the
only
american
connection
is
the
identity
of
the
victim.
so
i
would
have
wondered
whether
american
law
would
be
applied
by
an
american
court,
and
my
question
is,
what
happened?
i.e.,
when
you
raised
that
question,
what
happened,
or
is
that
question
in
the
case,
or
what
is
the
law
that
applies
under
american
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
it's
a
normal
rule
of
conflicts
that
even
if
you
have
an
accident
that
happens
somewhere
in
the
world,
a
korean
plane,
the
sea
of
japan,
a
russian
fault,
et
cetera,
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
the
victim
always
applies
no
matter
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about
without
the
treaty.
i
would
imagine
that
the
first
question
would
be,
if
article
24
applies
and
you're
supposed
to
use
local
law,
what
the
treaty
tells
you
to
do
is
pretend
there
is
no
treaty,
all
right.
now,
if
i'm
right
about
that,
the
first
question
would
be,
what
law
applies
for
an
american
court?
i
would
try...
the
one
thing
i...
i'm
asking
you
because
i'm
puzzled.
i'm
not
asking
as
an
argument.
the
one
thing
i
can't
find
in
this
case
is
some
kind
of
answer
to
that
question.
it
seems
to
me
lawyers
have
been
litigating
this
for
about
14
years
over
a
fairly
small
amount
of
damage,
and
so
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
status
of
that
is.
how
am
i
supposed
to
answer
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
are
we
supposed
to
treat
this
case,
given
that
problem
in
it?
are
we
supposed
to
pretend
it's
stipulated
out
when
it
wasn't,
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
making
the
assumption
that
article
17
is
ambiguous
and
doesn't
give
you
the
clear
answer
that
you
think,
that
article
24
says,
courts
of
the
world,
apply
your
own
law
when
you
decide
the
meaning
and
shape
out
who
gets
to
what
kinds
of
damages.
on
those
assumptions,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i
ask
you...
i'm
not...
one
puzzle
that
i
have
in
my
mind
still,
which
maybe
you've
just
answered
to
justice
scalia,
is
how
does
this
work
in
your...
in
your
mind,
the
treaty
refers
you
to,
say,
the
eastern
district
of
iowa,
or
whatever
it
is.
now,
we're
in
the
eastern
district
of
iowa,
and
the
first
thing
that
they
have...
say,
that
judge
there
is
a
federal
judge,
and
the
treaty
said
judge,
you
apply
the
law
you
would
apply
normally
without
the
treaty.
that's
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
why
isn't
the
first
thing
the
judge
would
do
is
say,
the
first
thing
i
have
to
decide
for
a
case
where
the
accident
happens
over
in
japan,
in
the
international
sea,
to
the
korean
airline
with
an
american
passenger,
is,
what
law
applies,
all
right.
now,
why
isn't
that
in
this
case?
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
can
you
do
that?
can
you
say,
we
all
agree
that
the
law
of
tibet
applies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right,
so
the
first
thing
the
judge
in
iowa
does
is,
he
gets
out
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
gives
anybody
in
the
world
a
right
of
action
if
they're
killed
on
the
high
seas.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
there
we
have
in
the
court
of
iowa,
we
have
a
person
from
italy
who
was
killed
in
an
airline
accident
in
korea
by
a
japanese,
so
the
first
thing...
or
in
the
sea
of
japan,
so
the
first
thing
i'd
wonder
is,
what
law
applies.
what
law
would
apply
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
they
didn't
bring
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that's...
suppose...
so
then
this
court
would
decide,
okay,
it's
an
italian,
it
involves
japan,
it
involves
korea,
so
we'll
apply
our
american
law
just
for
fun,
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
you
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
what
you
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
the
real
situation.
the
judge
in
iowa
picks
the
page
up,
chapter
21,
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
italian
has
the
cause
of
action,
now
he
asks
himself,
what
law
do
i
apply
here
to
find
out
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
the
party?
do
i
apply
the
rest
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act?
do
i
go
to
korean
law,
japanese
law,
italian
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
do
it?
i'm
genuinely
puzzled,
which
is
why
i'm
asking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
don't
believe
the
parties
would
just
stipulate
that
issue
out
of
the
case,
would
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then,
why
don't
you
have
to
do
that
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
a
victim...
that's
enough
to
get
american
law
to
apply,
even
though
the
accident's
abroad
and
everything
else--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
answer's
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
think
in
most
places
in
the
world...
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
passed
at
a
time
when
it
was
more
liberal,
really,
than
most
state
law,
but
tort
law
has
sort
of
gone
beyond
that
in
most
places
in
the
world,
and
you'd
think
almost
any
other
law
would
let
a
survivor
recover.
wouldn't
most
of
them
give
you
damages
for
pain
and
suffering...
sorry,
for
grief
and
for
loss
of
society?
