--if
we
are
to
take
seriously
your
argument
that
french
law,
french
jurisprudence
controls,
then
what
mustn't
we
take
into
account
all
of
french
law,
that
is,
how
it
in
fact
applies
in
france,
and
no
matter
how
many
elements
of
damages...
of
damage
would
be
included
in
the
word
dommage,
still,
there
are
no
juries
in
france,
and
awards
on
all
of
the
items
are
more
modest
than
they
are
in
the
united
states.
so
can
you
pick
the
part
of
the
french
law
that
you
like,
that
is,
the
list
of
what's
included
in
damages,
but
leave
out
the
fact
that
the
recovery
is
likely
to
be
a
lot
lower
if
you
have
the
same
case
before
a
french
trier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just...
if...
let's
just
say
pain
and
suffering
would
be
an
element,
but
in
fact
pain
and
suffering
damages
awarded
in
french
cases
do
not
compare
with
the
size
of
awards
in
this
country.
isn't
that
part
of
the
french
law
that
would
apply,
if,
indeed,
french
law
controls?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
not
a
report
that
a
company...
at
the
time
that
the
warsaw
convention
was
originally
drafted
that
said
there
were
the
two
problems,
the
who
and
the
what
damages,
that
they
couldn't
successfully
resolve
and
both
were
referred
to
local
law.
the
two
questions,
what
persons
in
the
case
of
death
would
recover
and
what
are
the
damages
subject
to
reparation,
the
report
accompanying
the
treaty
said
it
wasn't
possible
to
find
a
satisfactory
solution,
so
those
questions
were
not
regulated
by
the
convention
itself.
now,
you're
telling
us
that
dommage
must
mean
what
it
means
in
the
french
law.
there's
no
report
at
the
time
of
the
drafting
that
says
that.
are
you
relying
on
any
practice
abroad
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
this
treaty
that
everyone
looks
to
the
french
civil
law
to
see
how
it
should
be
construed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not...
that,
i
take
it,
is
not
the
argument.
the
argument
is,
how
do
you
fill
in
this
term,
and
if
we
reject
your
argument
that
it
has
a
plain
meaning,
then
there
are
several
sources
of
law
you
could
consult.
you've
mentioned
some
of
them.
you
can
look
at
the
laws
of
other
states,
you
can
look
at
general
maritime
law,
but
why
isn't
the
most
appropriate
reference
a
statute
passed
by
congress
meant
to
deal
with
tragedies
of
a
similar
kind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
want
us
to
deal
with
the
second
circuit
reasoning,
which
said
our
first
case
under
the
convention
was
the
lockerbie
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
we
thought
that
there
ought
to
be
this
uniformity,
and
that
wasn't
a
watery
death,
so
they
had
some
federal
common
law,
general
maritime
law,
which
is
a
little
more
giving
than
dohsa,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
harakas,
i'd
like
you
to
go
back
to
your
prior
answer,
because
i'm
not
confident
that
it's
clear
that
it
would
be
the
whole
law
of
the
united
states.
you
know
that
you
can
get
into
a
rather
messy
situation
in
defining
local
law
to
be
not
only
the...
not
the
conduct-regulating
rule,
but
the
choice-of-law
rule,
which
could
then
get
you
over
into
some
other
system,
and
then
you
must
ask,
is
it
the
whole
law,
including
the
choice-of-law
rule?
so
in
many
legal
contexts,
local
law
is
understood
to
mean
not
the
choice
of
law
rule,
but
you
go
directly
to
the
conduct-regulating
rule,
or
the
damage-setting
rule.
you
do
not
go
to
the
choice-of-law
just
so
you
will
avoid
this
kind
of
problem
that
conflicts
teachers
sometimes
call
the
rondure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
the
warsaw
convention,
is
there
nothing
that
tells
us
whether
local
law
means
whole
law
of
the
country,
or
substantive
law
of
the
country?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know,
mr.
harakas,
in
fact,
the...
have
there
been
actions
elsewhere
arising
out
of
the
kal
crash
that
has
occupied
our
court
now
for...
our
courts
for
over
a
decade,
but
talking
about
how
would
it
be
in
other
countries,
how
many
cases
are
pending
elsewhere
in
comparison
to
the
number
pending
in
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
many
in
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
in
the
original
carving
up
of
who
was
going
to
sue,
didn't
the
united
states
have
the
overwhelming
number
of
lawsuits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
most
of
the
people
who
were
killed
were
not
from
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
their
cases
don't
count,
at
least
formally,
as
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
nobody
would
cite
the
executive
jet
case
to
any
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
their
counterpart.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
meant
comparable
precedent
in
their
own
system.
you
might
cite
something
for
persuasive
value.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
remember
the
second
circuit
case
in
this
decision,
this
case
correctly
in
that
the
second
circuit,
wrong
or
right,
was
saying
that
in
these
international
air
disasters,
when
they
come
into
u.s.
courts
and
you
apply
the
provision
of
the
treaty
that
says,
local
law
applies,
the
second
circuit
thought
that
that
ought
to
be
one
local
law
whether
the
crash
occurred
in
scotland
on
land,
in
the
sea
of
japan,
or
over
california?
that
was
the
second
circuit's
view,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
didn't.
they
thought
the
general
maritime
law,
as
declared
in
gaudet,
was
a
very
fine
reference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
purpose
of
the
warsaw
convention
was
to
put
a
lid
on
the
damages,
wasn't
that
the
main
purpose
of
it,
so
that
the
then-infant
industry
would
be
able
to
grow
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
well,
i
thought
the
purpose
was
rather
to
put
a
lid
on
damages
but,
when
the
conduct
was
so
bad,
they
were
going
to
allow
it
to
be
handled
the
way
tort
litigation
was
handled
generally.
