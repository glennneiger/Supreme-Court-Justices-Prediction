justice
antonin
scalia
the
world
adopted
french
civil
law
when
it
subscribed
to
the
warsaw
treaty?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
what
do
you
mean,
one
indication?
do
we
look
to
french
civil
law
for
the
meaning
of
dommage,
or
do
we
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
do,
and
french
civil
law
governs.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
warsaw
treaty
adopted
french
civil
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
very
unlikely.
justice
antonin
scalia
every
element
of
damages
that
french
civil
law
includes
can
be
recovered
under
the
warsaw
treaty,
and
every
element
of
damages
that
french
civil
law
does
not
permit
to
be
recovered
must
be
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
this
french
civil
law
as
it
is
amended
from
year
to
year,
or
is
it
the
french
civil
law
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
effect
at
the
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
strange,
strange
system
you're...
i
mean,
french
law
governs
what
damage
may
be
recovered,
but
local
law
governs
who
gets
the
damages.
why
would
anyone
create
a
system
like
that?
it
seems
so
bizarre.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that,
but
i
never
look
at
that
stuff
anyway,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
alternate
interpretations
of
the
text,
you
shouldn't
impose
the
one
that
creates
a
bizarre
result,
and
it
seems
bizarre
to
me
that
french
law
should
determine
whether
there
can
be
recovery,
but
local
law
shall
determine
who
gets
the
recovery.
that's
what
you're
arguing.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
can
be
avoided
by
interpreting
article
25
as
justice
o'connor
suggested
it
could
be
interpreted.
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
correct
that
all
of
the
foreign
courts
that
have
grappled
with
this
except
one
have
applied
local
law
rather
than
french
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
one
court
was
overruled
by
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
that?
did
they
say
why
it
was
good
jurisprudential
policy
to
give
it
a
wide
meaning
rather
than
a
narrow
meaning?
justice
antonin
scalia
jurisprudence
favors
plaintiffs
rather
than
defendants,
is
that
the
jurisprudential
principle?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's--
--haven't
we
later
applied
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
determining
what
general
maritime
law
ought
to
be,
even
when
the
act
is
not
strictly
applicable?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
why
should
that
make
any
difference?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
either
french
law
applies
or
domestic
law
applies,
and
we've
done
arguing
on
the
first
one.
we're
now
arguing
on
whether,
if
domestic
law
applies,
it
ought
to
be
dohsa
or
something
else,
but
once
you
say
domestic
law
applies,
haven't
we
held
that
by
its
terms
dohsa
applies
here,
so
there's...
we
need
to
argue
about
what
general
maritime
law
might
be.
whatever
it
might
be,
the
very
words
of
dohsa
apply
to
this
case
by
reason
of
executive
jet,
isn't
that
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true
if
the
treaty
refers
to
french
law,
but
if
the
treaty
refers
to
united
states
law,
isn't
it
clear
that
the
united
states
law
is
dohsa?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
when
you
say
local
law
applies,
you
mean
local
law
including
the
local
choice
of
law
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
whatever
forum
you're
in
will
apply
its
own
choice
of
law
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
agreed
that
the
choice
of
law
of
this
forum,
if
it
is
local
law,
would
be
american
law,
and
properly
would
be
american
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
issue
is
not
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
want
a
uniform
law,
we'd
have
french
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
decide
you're
not
going
to
interpret
dommage
the
way
the
french
do,
it
seems
to
me
you've
abandoned
any
desire
for
uniform
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
california's
a
state.
yes,
that's
what...
i
don't
quite
understand
why...
what
is
your
answer,
if
the
action
had
occurred
in
flight
over
california?
would
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
provide
the
rule
under
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
we
have
a
case
before
us--
justice
antonin
scalia
--involving
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think...
you're
suggesting
what
the
answer
ought
to
be
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
do
you
think
we
should
have
a
different
rule
for
boats
and
airplanes?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
care,
mr.
harakas?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
don't
care,
do
you?
all
you
have
to
say
is,
in
this
case,
it's
on
the
high
seas,
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
applies?
why...
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
want
us
to
decide
other
cases,
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
lockerbie
is
not
california.
it's
not
within
any
of
the
states
of
the
united
states.
the
problem
that
justice
o'connor
is
posing
is
really
quite
different.
it
has
to
do
with
domestic
federalism
within
the
united
states.
lockerbie
doesn't
relate
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
that
lockerbie
properly
came
out
the
way
it
did
without
necessarily
saying
that
if
the
crash...
if
lockerbie
occurred
in
california,
california
law
wouldn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
the
treaty
make
an
american
court
apply
american
law,
even
where
an
american
court
would
normally
not
apply
american
law?
that's
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
which
you
mean,
including
the
choice
of
law,
which
was
the
question
justice
ginsburg
was
asking.
justice
antonin
scalia
hoe
did
you
find
that
out
about
french
law,
from
cases
or
from
treatises?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
they
use,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
do
the
french
treatises
say
about
this
issue
of
whether
article
17
applies
french
law,
french
treatises?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
a
number
of
american
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
abroad
there
are
a
number
of
treatises,
though.
there
are
quite
a
few
cited.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
rate
professors
higher
than
judges
over
there,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
can
tell
the
truth.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
court
of
appeals
second
circuit.
on
september
1,
1983,
korean
airlines
flight
ke007,
on
route
from
anchorage,
alaska
to
seoul,
south
korea
straight
into
the
air
space
of
the
soviet
union
and
was
shot
down
over
the
sea
of
japan.
all
on
board
were
killed,
including
the
passenger
muriel
kole.
ms.
kole's
sister
and
mother,
marjorie
zicherman
and
muriel
mahalek,
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
sued
respondent
korean
airlines
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
demanding
among
other
things
compensation
from
korean
airlines
for
their
loss
of
muriel
kole's
society.
this
loss
of
society
claim
was
brought
under
a
treaty
governing
international
transportation
called
the
warsaw
convention.
after
preliminary
proceedings
that
are
not
pertinent
here,
a
jury
awarded
$70,000
in
loss
of
society
damages
to
zicherman
and
$28,000
in
loss
of
society
damages
to
mahalek.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
set
aside
the
loss
of
society
damage
awards
holding
that
general
maritime
law
provides
the
substantive
law
governing
compensatory
damages
and
that
general
maritime
law
allows
loss
of
society
damages
only
to
those
who
are
dependents
of
the
decedent
at
the
time
of
the
decedent's
death.
concluding
that
the
decedent's
mother,
mahalek
could
not
establish
dependency,
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
her
award.
it
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination
whether
the
decedent's
sister,
zicherman
could
establish
dependency.
in
their
petition
for
certiorari
petitioners
contended
that
under
general
maritime
law
“dependency
is
not
a
requirement
for
recovery
of
loss
of
society
damages”
and
in
a
cross
petition,
korean
airlines
contended
that
the
warsaw
convention
does
not
allow
recovery
for
loss
of
society
damages
in
this
case
regardless
of
the
dependency.
the
first
and
principle
question
before
us
is
whether
damages
for
loss
of
society
are
made
recoverable
by
article
17
of
the
warsaw
convention
which
provides
that
“in
the
event
of
an
accidental
death
for
which
it
is
responsible
the
air
carrier
is
liable
for
“damage
sustained".
the
ordinary
dictionary
meaning
of
damage
or
as
it
appears
in
the
authoritative
french
text
of
treaty
"dommage",
embraces
harms
such
as
the
mental
distress
of
some
stranger
who
read
about
muriel
kole's
death
in
a
paper,
that
no
legal
system
would
compensate
and
at
the
parties
to
the
warsaw
convention
could
not
conceivably
have
agreed
to
compensate.
thus,
the
word
obviously
is
understood,
not
in
its
ordinary
dictionary
sense
but
in
its
distinctively
legal
sense
that
is
in
the
sense
of
legally
cognizable
harm.
furthermore,
the
use
of
the
french
word
"dommage",
in
the
official
text
does
not
establishe
as
the
content
of
legally
cognizable
harm
whatever
french
law
accepted
as
such
when
the
convention
was
drafted
in
1929.
no
case
of
ours
under
the
convention
provides
precedence
for
the
adoption
of
french
law
in
such
detail
and
it
is
implausible
that
the
mere
use
of
the
french
language
was
meant
to
require
compensation
for
elements
of
harm
recognized
in
france
but
unrecognized
elsewhere
or
to
forbid
compensation
for
that
matter,
for
elements
of
harm
unrecognized
in
france
but
recognized
in
elsewhere.
thus,
we
read
article
17,
“to
permit
compensation
for
legally
cognizable
harm
as
determined
by
whatever
domestic
or
national
law
is
applicable”.
this
conclusion
is
confirmed
by
article
24
of
the
convention
the
text
of
which
i
need
not
burned
you
with
by
the
drafting
and
negotiating
history,
the
contracting
states
post
gratification
understanding
of
the
convention
and
the
views
of
expert
commentators.
having
concluded
that
the
question
of
legally
cognizable
harm
is
to
resolve
by
the
domestic
law,
the
next
question
to
which
we
would
logically
turn
is
that
of
“which
sovereign's
domestic
law?”
what
is
known
in
legal
parliaments
as
a
choice
of
law
question?
in
this
case,
we
spare
that
inquiry
because
the
parties
agree
that
if
as
we
have
determined
the
issue
of
compensable
harm
unresolved
by
the
convention
itself
then
it
is
governed
in
this
case
by
the
law
of
the
united
states.
the
final
question
then
is
which
particular
law
of
the
united
states.
the
second
circuit
held
the
general
maritime
law
governs
all
causes
of
action
under
the
convention
whether
the
accident
in
questions
occurs
over
land
or
on
the
high
seas.
it
said
this
was
necessary
in
order
to
“maintain
a
uniform
law
under
the
convention”.
we
think
not.
the
convention
neither
adopted
any
uniform
rule
of
its
own
nor
authorize
national
courts
to
pursue
uniformity
in
derogation
of
otherwise
applicable
law.
congress
may
choose
to
enact
special
provisions
applicable
to
warsaw
convention
cases
but
absent
such
legislation
article
17
and
24
of
the
convention
provide
nothing
more
than
a
pass
through
authorizing
us
to
apply
the
law
that
would
govern
in
the
absence
of
the
convention.
there
is
a
little
doubt
with
that
law
is
in
this
case.
the
death
of
muriel
kole
falls
within
the
literal
terms
of
section
761
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
dohsa,
and
it
is
well
established
that
those
provisions
apply
to
airplane
crashes.
since
recovery
under
dohsa
is
limited
to
pecuniary
damage,
petitioners
cannot
recover
loss
of
society
damage.
furthermore,
we
upheld
in
earlier
cases
that
where
dohsa
applies
neither
state
law
nor
general
maritime
law
can
provide
a
basis
for
recovery
of
loss
of
society
damages.
accordingly,
we
reverse
that
portion
of
that
second
circuit
judgment
permitting
zicherman
to
recover
loss
of
society
damages
if
she
can
establish
her
dependency,
and
we
affirm
that
portion
of
the
judgment
vacating
the
award
of
loss
of
society
damages
to
mahalek.c
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
