mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
what
is
the
united
states
law
that
is
applicable--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--in
the
action
that
was
pled
here...
there
were
actions
pled
under
the
warsaw
convention
and
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
now,
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
there
is
a...
its
own
conflict
of
law
provision
saying,
under
section
4,
that
you
can
avail
yourself
to
any
remedies
provided
by
local
law.
now,
with
respect
to
the
choices
of
law
issue,
there
is
the
harris
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
where
the
court
did
do
a
choice
of
law
analysis
under
the
warsaw
convention.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
exactly.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
exactly.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
exactly.
you
could
have
a
warsaw
convention
case,
but
then
there
can
be...
there's
nothing
in
the
convention
that
would
preclude
you
from
applying...
doing
a
choice-of-law
analysis,
and
in
fact
the
drafters,
when
they
were
drafting
the
convention,
were
unable
to
agree
to
that
specific
issue
because
of
the
very
different
views
with
respect
to
which
law
do
you
apply,
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no,
your
honor.
i
would
contend
that
in
that
situation,
that
if
you
want
to
have
a
desire
for
uniform
law,
because
the
convention
does...
is
a
federal
treaty,
it
should
be
interpreted
under
one
uniform
law,
and
you
could
apply
by
analogy
other
federal
statutes.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
any--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
that's
correct
with
respect
to...
at
the
international
level.
the
drafters
never
accepted
the
fact
that
they
cannot
come
up
with
one
uniform
rule
at
the
international
level
as
to
damages
and
who
can
recover
damages.
they
left
that
to
the
domestic
states.
now,
when
you
look
to
the
convention--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--yes,
it
would,
by
analogy,
not
directly,
your
honor,
because
when
i
refer
to
states
i
really
am
referring
to
nations,
because
when
you
look
at
the
convention,
the
convention
is
a
contract
between
countries,
not--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--no,
not
by...
not
directly,
but
i
think
when
you
look
to
the
progression
of
the
general
maritime
law
cause
of
action
for
wrong
death,
especially
under
the
principles
of
moragne
and
miles--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes,
the
calhoun
case,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
i
would
say--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--no,
i
think
you
should
have
one
uniform
rule,
but
in,
let's
say
the
calhoun
situation,
i
think
the
moragne
case
sent
a
strong
signal
what
the
court
was
doing
with
the
application
of
state
statutes
in
the
territorial
water.
moragne--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
there's
no
specific
provision
in
the
convention
because
when
they
were
drafting
the
convention
i
don't...
the
drafters
were
not
looking
to
the
federal
system
that
we
have
in
our
country,
in
any
specific
country.
of
course,
the
united
states
had
only
sent
observers
to
the
conference.
they
were
more
concerned...
they
were
looking
at
nations
as
a
whole,
and
what
happens
domestically,
the
drafters
didn't
address
that
issue,
but
when
you
look
to
the
convention,
i
think
in
our
system
it
does
create...
it
is
a
federal
treaty,
and
it
should
be
interpreted
at
the
federal
level
with
one
consistent,
uniform
law.
my
argument...
my
basic
argument
is
that
on
the
high
seas--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
i
think
that's
where
we
run
into
one
of
the
problems
here,
is
that
when
it
does
occur
over
the
high
seas,
that
you
do
have
a
directly
applicable
federal
statute.
let's
say,
the
scenario
you
gave
with
respect
to
california,
your
honor,
in
that
situation
an
argument
could
be
made,
if
you
were
just
going
to
look
to
the
various
states,
that
you
would
apply
california
law,
but
i
think
there
are
other
considerations
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
it
isn't--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--it
would
be...
that
is
a
simple
issue,
the
simple
answer
to
my
case
here,
because
it
is
in
fact
just
a
death
on
the
high
seas
act
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
you
to
go
beyond
the
facts
of
our
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
that's
correct,
they
did
look
to
general
maritime
law,
and
the
problem
with
that
case
is,
they
looked
to
gaudet
as
representative
of
general
maritime
law.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
the
lockerbie--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--you
could
do
that,
and
in
our
case
that
is
a
necessary
determination
to
be
made
in
our
case,
because
you
do
have
the
federal
statute.
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
reach
that.
the
only
point
i'm
making
here
is
that,
if
the
court
wants
to
address
the
lockerbie
case
in
order
to
come
up
with
unified
rule
as
what
the
lockerbie
court
was
concerned
with,
then
the
proper
rule
should
be
taken
from
looking
to
other
federal
wrongful
death
statutes.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
because
in
this
case
it
was...
you
look
to
what
is
the
united
states
law
that
would
apply
in
that
context.
i
think
all
parties
have
agreed
that
it
would--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--no,
of
course...
parties
can't
agree
to
tell
the
court
what
law
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
in
that
case,
then,
you
could...
if
the
parties
brought
it
up,
you
could
make
a
federal--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--no.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
what
you
should
do
in
that
situation,
let's
say
you
didn't
have
the
federal
statute
or
anything--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i
understand--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--no.
well,
in
a
situation
like
that,
you
could
do
a
federal
choice-of-law
analysis
to
see,
just
like
in
the
harris
case,
to
see
which
law
you
would
apply.
i
think
in
the
harris
case
they
did
apply
the
law
of--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--because
we
brought...
the
action
was
in
the
context
of
the
death
of
the
high
seas
act,
and
the
decedents
in
this
case,
of
course,
were
united
states
citizens
and
residents
of
new
york
or
massachusetts.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
the
death
on
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--the
death...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
but
i
would
like
to
just
add
to
that
is
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
does
give
the
court
jurisdiction
for
any
death
occurring
on
the
high
seas,
and
it
doesn't
specify
that
you
have
to
any
other
nexus
is
required
other
than
the
application
of
a
death
occurring
on
the
high
seas.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
the...
there's
no
specific
provision
saying
that
in
those
terms,
but
with
respect
to
the
substantive
law,
it
does
tell
you,
go
to
the
law
of
the
court
where
the
action
is
pending.
i
think
when
you
look
to,
let's
say
article
28,
or
other
various
provisions,
it's
always
referenced
in
terms
of
the
law
of
the
court
where
the
action
is
pending.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
i
don't...
the
treaty
doesn't
do
that.
it
just
leaves
the
whole
issue
to
the
domestic
law
of
the
country,
and
at
that
level--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--i
would
say
it
would
include
the
choice
of
law,
because
the
convention
specifically
didn't
want
to
deal
with
that
issue,
because
every
time
they
tried
to
insert
a
choice
of
law
provision
there
was
a
lot
of
objection
to
that,
and
in
fact
any
choice-of-law
provisions
other
than
a
couple
of
places
where
it
specifically
says,
look
to
your
national
law,
were
deleted
from
the
convention.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case
here
it's...
you
do
have
a
death
on
the
high
seas,
and
that
gives
the
court
juris...
a
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
action,
and
when
you're
talking
about
looking
into
foreign
laws,
the
pleader
does
have
the
option
to
bring
in
elements
of
foreign
law
within
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
i
think
here,
when
you
have
an
international
crash
on
the
high
seas,
and
you
do
have
a
death
on
the
high
seas
act
that
is
applicable,
that
does
give
the
court
jurisdiction,
and
at
that
point,
the
elements
of
damages
are
set
out,
and
i
don't
think
you
have
to
engage,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
in
a
choice-of-law
analysis.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i
don't
think
so,
because
even
with
respect
to
the
application
of
foreign
law,
if
the
court
finds
that
it
should
apply
to
foreign
law,
which
i
don't
get
into
now
because
i
don't
think
you
have
to,
but
if
it
does,
then
the
issue
comes
down
to,
what
are
those
damages
recoverable
under
that
foreign
law,
and
that
just
leads
to
more
disarray
in
the
convention
itself,
with...
each
court
starts
engaging
in
various
choice-of-law
analysis.
you
want
to--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
for...
a
lot
of
the
civil
law
countries
do
allow
brief
damages,
but
a
lot
of
the
civil
law
countries
still
don't
allow
loss
of
society
or
nonpecuniary
damages.
for
example,
at
the
time
the
convention
was
drafted,
i
think
a
majority
of
the
states
did
not
allow
nonpecuniary
damages.
you
had
countries
like
the
soviet
union
that
were
involved
in
the
drafting
of
that,
and
their
strict
pecuniary
loss
at
that
time,
and
if
you
had
told
someone
from
the
soviet
union
that
you're
going
to
be
allowing
nonpecuniary
damages
under
french
law,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
signed
on
to
this
convention.
in
addition--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--i
believe
there
are
four
actions
pending
in
canada,
and
five
actions
pending
in
japan.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
currently
pending,
approximately
40
in
the
united
states.
everything
else
has
been
settled.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
were
over
101
actions
filed
in
the
united
states.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
a
number
of
people,
they
worked...
i
can't
remember
the
exact
breakdown
of
the
citizenship,
but
most
of
those
people
were
either
settled
before
the
case
came
to
trial,
or
they
settled
in
their
own
countries
with
korean
airlines.
but
when
you
look
back,
just
to
pick
up
again
on
the
issue
of
recoverable
damages
in
france,
mr.
needham
says
that
it
allows
loss
of
society
damages,
and
those
damages
are
nonpecuniary,
and
they
were
recoverable
in
1929.
but
from
the
references
cited
in
the
briefs,
and
i've
done
some
research
on
the
issue,
the
only
thing
i
could
discern
that
in
1929,
france
allowed
grief
damages,
but
i
couldn't
see
anything
that
allowed
loss
of
society
damages,
per
se,
even
under
french
law,
and
even
the
grief
damages,
they
were
in
a
minority
position
at
that
time.
i
don't
think
you
can
adopt
the
entire
body
of
french
law
from
1929
and
bring
it
into
a
treaty
and
say,
this
is
what
you're
going
to
apply
in
the
united
states.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
from
treatises,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
there's
no
french
decision
i
was
able
to
locate--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--that
discusses
this
issue,
because
basically
in
french
law
they
just
allow
any
damages
that
are
certain
and
direct.
that's
the
basic
principle
of
french
civil
law.
the
only
other
cases
i've
been
able
to
locate
are
some...
a
canadian
case,
which
basically
applied
the
law
of
quebec,
and
there
is
the
preston
case
that
was
brought
up
here,
and
the
court
didn't
engage
in
extensive
analysis--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--and
a
number
of
american
cases
all
adopting
unanimously
the
view
that
you
go
to
your
domestic
law.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes,
there
are
a
number
of
treatises,
and
they're
all
unanimous
in
that
view.
i
was
unable
to
find
anyone
taking
a
contrary
position.
now,
with
the
preston
case,
that
case--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--um--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--sometimes.
i
don't
think
they're...
i'm
not
going
to--
[laughter]
--go
on
with
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no,
they
don't,
not
in
a
civil
law
country,
even
though
they
tend
to
be
persuasive
enough
to
other
courts,
but
formally
they
don't.
but--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--they
do
sometimes
cite
to...
refer
to
american
decisions,
because
since
the
united
states
decisions
are
one
source
of
law
where
the
convention
has
been
analyzed
to--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--yes,
you
might
cite
that.
a
court
would
look
at
it,
but
they
wouldn't
be
obliged
to
follow
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no.
i
think
what
i
would
like
you...
the
opinion
to
say
would
be,
is,
the
warsaw
convention
refers
the
court
to
domestic
law,
and
then
the
domestic
law
in
the
context...
you
have
to
look
to
the
context
where
you're
in,
and
the
domestic
law
in
the
context
of
that
case,
you
look
to
the
federal
law
that
applies,
and
that
case
is
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no.
i...
the...
i
think
with
respect
to
the
korean
law
issue,
that
can
come
in
through
the
federal
statute,
through
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
under
section
4.
there
was
specific
provision
for
that
under
section
4
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
and
then
the
issue
comes
down
to,
in
that
situation,
whether
those
remedies
are
in
addition
to
the
remedies
provided
by
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
or
are
those
just
the
exclusive
remedies
which
the
lower
courts
have
taken
conflicting
views
on.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
in...
outside
the
context
of
our...
because
let's
say
in
the
case
where
dohsa
is
not
applicable,
where
you
don't
have
a
federal
statute
giving
you
the
court
jurisdiction,
that
you
do
have
a...
you
can't
have
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
warsaw
convention
itself,
and
at
that
point
the
court
could
do
a
choice-of-law
analysis
and
go
to
another
country,
but
in
the
context
of
our
case--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--it
did
arise
under
the
law
of
the
warsaw
convention,
and
it
occurred...
the
deaths
and
everything
arose
on
the
high
seas,
and
that's
enough
to
trigger
the
applicability
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
the
plaintiffs
here
were
americans,
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
you
have
the
option--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
thank
you,
your
honors.
the
only
other
point
that
i
just
want
to
stress
here
is
that
in
developing
this
law
in
this
case,
i
think
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
higginbotham
case,
where
the
court
was
faced
with
the
same
question
that
the
second
circuit
faced.
do
you
apply
the
law
chosen
by
congress
under
dohsa,
or
the
law
developed
by
the
court
in
gaudet,
and
in
higginbotham
the
court
said,
you
cannot
use
gaudet
to
allow
loss
of
society
damages
where
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
applies.
all
those
precedents
following
higginbotham
and
miles
show
the
restrictive
nature
of
the
gaudet
remedy,
and
in
fact
gaudet
has
been
limited
specifically
to
its
facts
with
respect
to,
it
only
applies
in
territorial
waters,
and
it
only
applies
to
longshoremen.
the
second
circuit
didn't
address
that
issue
in
looking
to
gaudet,
and
just
adopted
gaudet
as
a
general
representation
of
maritime
law
today,
and
i
think
the
second
circuit
was
incorrect
in
approaching
the
issue
in
that
manner.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
i'm
saying
in
our
particular
case,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
any
further
than
just
looking
to
the
context
of
our
case
in
dohsa,
but
if
the
court
is
concerned
with
the
uniformity
issue,
i
think
there
is
room
to
develop
a
uniform
rule,
but
i
don't
think
we...
in
the
context
of
our
case
we
have
to
go
any
further
than
dohsa--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--for
death
on
the
high
seas.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--not
necessarily,
because
when
you're
talking
about
uniformity,
you're
not
talking
about
treaty
uniformity,
you're
talking
about--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--american
uniformity.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
and
then
when
you're
looking
to
the
rule
of
what
should
be
the
uniform
rule,
you
should
look
first
to
the
federal
statute
to
see
is
there
a
directly
applicable
statute,
and
even
when
there
isn't
a
directly
applicable
statute,
is
there
a
policy
in
similar
statutes
that
congress
has
expressed
what
types
of,
in
this
case
damages
are
recoverable,
and
when
you
look
to
each
of
those
federal
statutes,
there
is
one
consistency
between
the
jones
act,
dohsa,
and
fela.
it's
pecuniary
losses
only.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes,
your
honor,
it
was,
and
that's
where
i
think
they
ran
into
trouble
in
trying
to
find
what
this
uniform
law
is,
and
they
adopted--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--that's
what
they
did
look
to,
but
i
think
you
have
to...
when
you're
applying
and
looking
for
federal
law,
it's
just
the
general
maritime
law
doesn't
have
a
life
of
its
own.
i
think
the
court's
decisions
in
miles
and
moragne
showed
us
that
the
general
maritime
law
is
derived
from
the
maritime
statutes.
because
today
there
are
so
many
statutes
out
there,
we
have
to
look
at
those
statutes
for
guidance,
and
those
statutes
direct
the
court
and
control
the
latitude
that
a
court
has
in
fashioning
a
remedy
or
recognizing
a
remedy,
and
i
don't
think
the
second
circuit
took
those
considerations
into
account.
they
viewed
general
maritime
law
as
something
separate
and
distinct
from
those
maritime
statutes.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
within
europe,
that
would
be
true,
but
beyond
that
i
think
the
drafters
noted
the
issue...
they
foresaw,
because
lindbergh
had
just
crossed
the
atlantic
in
1927--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--and
the
end
of
world
war
i--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--not
at
that
time,
but
they
foresaw
that
coming
to
be,
and
in
fact
within
10
years
that's
what--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--over
land,
but
a
flight
between
london
and
the
continent
would
have
been
over
the
high
seas--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--over
the
channel,
and
in
fact
transportation
even
between
the
united
states,
there
were
flights
between
the
united
states
and
cuba,
and
those
were
over
the
high
seas...
over--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--international
waters
as
well.
just
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
court
should
reverse
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
below
extending
gaudet
to
the
high
seas
and
allowing
loss
of
society
damages
and
reaffirm
the
basic
principle
in
this
case
and
in
maritime
law
that
damages
for
loss
of
society
simply
are
not
recoverable
for
a
death
on
the
high
seas.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
conclude.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
thank
you.
