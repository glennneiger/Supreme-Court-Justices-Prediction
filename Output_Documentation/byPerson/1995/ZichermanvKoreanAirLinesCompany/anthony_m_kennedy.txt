justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
french...
did
french
law
determine
the
meaning
of
misconduct
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
it's
the
law
of
the
case
because
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion
that
u.s.
law
applies,
not
korean
law,
u.s.
law
of
some
sort.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
it
not
the
law
of
the
case
that
korean
law
cannot
apply,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
the
warsaw
convention
korean
law
might
have
applied
in
some
cases,
might
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
case
did
you
rely
on,
mr.
needham?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
date
of
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
shouldn't
the
complete
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
include
a
citation
to
executive
jet?
we
applied
dohsa
there,
a
domestic
flight
crash
in...
on
the
high
seas.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
neither
was
it
in
executive
jet.
i
just
think
you
have
to
confront
the
consequences
of
executive
jet.
say
that
we
were
wrong
in
executive
jet,
if
you
want
to
make
that
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
first
you
say
it's
the
treaty,
and
then
we
get
you
back
to
the...
what
should
the
domestic
law
be?
we've
said
in
executive
jet
that
dohsa
is
the
closest
analogue,
and
we're
going
to
apply
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
said
it
was
the
law
of
the
case
because
of
what
the
d.c.
circuit
held,
at
least
as
to
the
definition
of
misconduct,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
it's
not
the
law
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
concern
is,
is
that
if
you
have
just
stipulated
with
the
other
parties
that
u.s.
law,
including
u.s.
choice-of-law
principles
apply,
and
u.s.
law
applies
to
determine
the
substantive
issues
in
the
case,
then
the
case
may
not
be
as
important
as
you
told
us
in
the
writ
for
certiorari,
or
as
the
petitioner
has
told
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
other
courts
in
a
number
of
other
cases
would,
and
would
apply
foreign
law,
then
this
case
has
less
significance
than
it
would
otherwise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
your
view,
would
you
like
this
court
to
hold...
i'm
not
saying
we
would,
but
i
mean,
would
you
like
the
court
to
hold,
is
that
the
treaty
refers
you
back
to
domestic
law,
then,
in
a
case
where
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
american
law
applies,
under
those
circumstances,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
limits
the
recovery,
but
in
the
cases
where
they
haven't
made
that
stipulation
in
court,
now...
am
i
right?
now
we
have
a
blank
to
fill
in,
and...
am
i
right
about
what
you
want
us
to
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
a
case
where
the
parties
said,
please,
judge,
it's
korean
law
that
applies,
you
would
like
us
to
say
that
isn't
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
point...
it's
been
slow,
but
i
think
the
light
is
dawning.
you're
saying
when
you
sue
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
there's
a
specific
provision,
section
4,
that
tells
you
whenever
a
right
of
action
is
granted
by
the
law
of
a
foreign
state,
you
can
sue
on
that
one,
so
a
person
who
doesn't
mention
that
is
a
person
who
is
deemed
to
have
forgotten
by
that
one...
forget
it,
cut
it
out...
and
therefore
wants
american
law
to
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
have
your
option,
but
you
have
to
state
what
your
option
is,
and
unless
they
refer
to
section
4,
they
must
be
taking
the
american
option.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
your
point.
i've
got
it.
thank
you.
