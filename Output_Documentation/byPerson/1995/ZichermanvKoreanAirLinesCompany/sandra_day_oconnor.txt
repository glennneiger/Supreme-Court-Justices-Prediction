justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
needham,
the
warsaw
convention
also
contains
article
24,
and
under
article
24,
which
refers
back
to
article
17,
where
you
find
the
phrase
dommage
survenu,
it
appears
to
leave
the
level
and
nature
of
damages
under
the
warsaw
convention
subject
to
limitations
and
law
of
the
signatory
nations.
article
24,
subsection
2,
has
to
have
some
meaning.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
a
signatory
state
that
does
not
permit
a
cause
of
action
after
death
to
a
survivor,
only
to
the
estate
of
the
decedent?
would
article
24
refer
us
back
to
who
should
recover
under
the
law
of
the
signatory
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
it
were
a
domestic
flight
that
had
gone
down
over
the
high
seas,
i
assume
that
there
would
be
no
damages
such
as
you
are
recovering...
seeking
to
recover
here
for
loss
of
society.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
domestic
passengers
would
not
be
able
to
recover--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
loss
of
society.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
we've
said
that
when
a
death
occurs
on
the
high
seas
it's
governed
by
dohsa,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
say
the
cause
of
action
is
created
by
the
warsaw
convention?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
file
suit
under
korean
law,
do
you
suppose,
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
counsel,
the
question
is
whether
u.s.
law
should
apply
at
all.
i
had
assumed
that
you
were
taking
the
position
that
u.s.
law
applies
and...
in
this
case,
and
the
other
side
is,
too,
and
somehow
you
expect
us
to
decide
the
case
on
that
basis,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
that
isn't
the
answer,
if
it
should
turn
out
that
this
court
does
not
think
that
moragne
extends
to
territorial
water,
and
certainly
not
to
land,
then
what
should
happen
in
the
warsaw
convention,
and
where
do
you
read
in
the
warsaw
convention
some
notion
that
the
law
of
the
signatory
state
has
to
be
uniform
in
giving
the
answers
to
those
questions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
don't
understand
why.
i
mean,
if
all
it
does
is
refer
you
to
the
law
of
the
signatory
state,
why
can't
that
be
whatever
the
law
of
the
signatory
state
is,
which
may
not
in
fact
be
uniform
with
regard
to
the
answer,
depending
on
whether
it
occurred
over
the
high
seas
or
over
land?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
don't
think
it's
quite
that
easy.
if
a
korean
passenger
were
on
the
airplane
and
died,
and
wanted
to
sue
in
the
united
states,
and
if
the
parties
wanted
to
raise
the
issue,
why
wouldn't
the
court
in
the
united
states
have
to
make
a
choice-of-law
decision
that
might
well
refer
them
to
korean
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
this
case
arose
under
law
of
the
warsaw
convention?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
i
have
one
question.
i
hate
to
ask
at
the
last
minute,
but
the
complaint
had
count
i,
a
suit
under
the
warsaw
convention,
count
ii,
a
suit
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
in
which
it
asserts
that
korean
law
is
applicable.
what
happened
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
happened
to
that
count
ii,
death
on
the
high
seas--
