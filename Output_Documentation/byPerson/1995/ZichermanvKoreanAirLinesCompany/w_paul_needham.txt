mr.
w.
paul
needham
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
september
1,
1983,
muriel
kole
lost
her
life
as
a
result
of
the
wilful
misconduct
of
korean
air
lines.
suit
was
instigated
in
the
federal
district
court
pursuant
to
the
warsaw
convention,
and
loss
of
society
damages
were
awarded
by
a
jury.
loss
of
society
damages,
it
is
our
position,
pursuant
to
article
17
of
the
warsaw
convention,
are
damages
sustained.
that
is
a
treaty
entered
into
force
in
1934.
the
phrase
is
damage
sustained,
or
dommage
survenu.
it
is
our
position
that
based
on
the
plain
meaning
of
those
words,
damage
equals
loss,
and
loss
equals
loss
of
society.
this
is
consistent
with
french
civil
law,
and
this
court
in
saks
said
that
french
civil
law
plays
a
role
in
determining
the
interpretation
of
the
word,
dommage
survenu,
and
when
the
phrase
dommage
survenu,
or
damage
sustained,
is
used,
there
was
no
pecuniary
restriction.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor,
but
french
civil
law
is
one
indication
of
the
meaning
of
those
words
at
the
time
it
was
drafted.
since
the
united
states
did
not
attend,
it
was
in
french,
and
the
french
civil
law
and
continental
jurists
drafted
it,
and
in
saks
this
court
says
that--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--we
do.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
it
governs--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--it
did--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--it
did
to
the
extent...
this
court
in
saks
said
that
you
look
to
french
civil
law
because
that's
the
law
that
was
used
when
it
was
drafted,
and
dommage
survenu
in
french
civil
law
includes
both
dommage
moral
and
dommage
material,
which
is
both
the
pecuniary
damages
and
the
moral
damages.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--i
believe
it
would
be
the
french
civil
law
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
but
more
than
anything,
your
honor,
it's
the
plain
meaning,
because
this
court
in
interpreting
treaties,
and
in
the
chan
case
this
court
looked
at
plain
meaning,
and
in
the
chan
case,
your
honor--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--we
look
at
french
civil
law
to
determining
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
dommage
survenu,
and
we
note
that
they
did
not
restrict
it
to
pecuniary
laws.
that's
the
main
thrust
of
our
argument,
not
that
the
entire
convention
is
governed
by
french
civil
law,
but
that
the
definition
of--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--if
french
law
controlled
everything,
that
would
the
case,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
we
are
before
you
on
loss
of
society,
and
the
narrow
question
is
whether
the
phrase
dommage
survenu
in
french
law,
the
phrase
dommage,
includes
loss
of
society
or
dommage
moral,
and
we
contend
that
it
does.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
well,
your
honor,
we
would
contend
that
subsection
2
of
article
24
refers
to
the
procedural
matters
to
the
state,
and
it
reads
that
without
prejudice
to
the
questions
as
to
who
are
the
persons
who
have
the
right
to
bring
suit,
and
what
are
their
respective
rights...
rather
than
saying
what
are
their
rights,
what
are
their
respective
rights.
and
our
reading
of
that
is,
respective
meaning
what
are
their
rights
vis-a-vis
one
another.
what
are
their
rights,
who
has
standing
to
bring
the
suit,
who
may
recover,
what
special
questions
go
to
the
jury,
and
that
the
plain
meaning
doctrine
still
applies,
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word.
and
this
court
in
the
chan
case
looked
very
closely
at
the
warsaw
convention,
in
article
3,
where
it
says
ticket
delivered,
and
said
it
could
not
substitute
the
phrase,
a
conforming
ticket
delivered,
or
a
regular
ticket
delivered,
and
we
contend
in
this
case
you
would
have
to
insert
the
phrase,
dommage
material
survenu,
or
pecuniary
damages.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
i
think
it
would
to
the
extent
that
that
state
decides
who
may
bring
the
lawsuits
and
who
is
entitled
to
have
which
question
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
well,
reading
through
the
minutes,
your
honor,
the
united
states
was
not
present.
you
had
civil
law
countries,
common
law
countries,
and
the
convention
has
a
whole
series
of
very,
almost
conflicting
terms.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
well,
your
honor,
i
would
submit--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--well,
when
the
warsaw
convention
wanted
a
reference
to
local
law,
they
were
very
specific.
in
article
21,
article
28,
article
29,
they
said
local
law,
go
to
local
law.
so
that's
our...
that's
our
argument,
and
we
think
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
damage
cap.
this
is
a
unique
treaty
where
there
is
a
damage
cap,
and
when
this
treaty
was
negotiated,
at
the
time
it
was
negotiated
there
was
great
concern
about
the
airline
industry
not
staying
in
business.
there
was
great
concern
that
any
large
liability
lost
and
they'd
be
out
of
business.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
it
did
not.
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
article
25
that
you
can
use
the
phrase,
wilful
misconduct,
or
whatever
equivalent
you
have
in
your
local
law,
and
in
that
case
they
were
very
specific
about
going
to
local
law.
but
it's
interesting
to
note,
even
in
its
infancy
when
there
was
great
concern
about
the
viability
of
the
airline
industry,
even
then
the
warsaw
convention
determined
that
if
there
is
wilful
misconduct
there
is
no
pact,
so
even
at
a
time
when
they
were
very
concerned
about
being
able
to
attract
capital,
very
concerned
about
being
able
to
get
insurance,
even
at
that
time
they
concluded
that
if
there
was
wilful
misconduct
there
was
no
cap,
and
if
there's
wilful
misconduct
and
there's
no
cap,
then
there
are
limited
damages,
and
we
contend
to
deter
the
wrongful
misconduct,
and
because
there
is
a
deterrence
factor,
and
because
there
are
not
punitive
damages
available,
this
court
must
allow
a
broad
range
of
compensatory
damages.
to
have
a
cap
off
so
there's
wilful
misconduct
that
needs
to
be
deterred,
and
then
to
graft
on
some
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
phrase,
dommage
survenu,
would
give
the
airline
a
double
layer
of
protection
that
it
did
not
negotiate--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--i'm
relying
more
on
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words,
and
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
as
they
appear
in
the
treaty.
however,
if
this
court.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
well,
there's
the--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--well,
that
one
court
is
preston
v.
hunting
air
transport,
which
is
an
english
case,
and
then
there's
the
israeli
case
which
this
court
cited
with
some
disfavor
in
floyd
when
it
awarded
emotional
damages,
called
air
france
v.
titner,
a
case
in
israel,
when
they
looked
at
the
plain
meaning
of
article
17
and
said
it
was
good
jurisprudential
policy
to
give
it
a
wide
meaning.
however,
if
this
court
concludes--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--i
don't
know.
it
concerned
the
israelis
who
were
hijacked
to
entebbe.
they
had
no
physical
injuries,
but
they'd
been
very
traumatized,
and
the
court
concluded--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--well,
i
think
the
principle
is
that
a
treaty
with
a
cap
such
as
this,
when
the
cap
is
off,
that
the
good
jurisprudential
policy
is
to
give
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
and
to
give
adequate
compensation.
this
court--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--i
favor
the
broader
one
in
this
case
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
deterrent
element
to
this
convention.
the
united
states
signed
this
convention
and
carriers
agreed
that
they
would
be
subject
to
limitations.
75,000
is
a
limitation.
if
the
airplane
is
negligent,
and
100
people
lose
their
lives,
they
write
out
a
check
for
7.5
million.
in
that
very
unusual
instance,
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
points
out
there's
only
eight
reported
cases
of
wilful
misconduct
since
1934,
when
that
occurs
the
cap
should
be
off.
when
that
occurs,
for
deterrence
if
nothing
else,
there
should
be
a
broad
range
of
compensatory
damages
to
deter
the
wrongful
misconduct
and
to
allow
compensation
to
the
plaintiffs,
who
suffer
under
this
cap.
american
citizens
have
a
cap
out
there,
a
75,000
cap.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
treaty
says
that
the
airlines
or
the
carrier
may
not
invoke
that
cap
when
there's
a
finding
of
wilful
misconduct.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
we
do
not,
your
honor.
we
say
in
this
particular
case
that
there
is
no
grief,
there
are
no
punitive
damages.
we're
saying
in
this
particular
case
that
loss
of
society
should
be
awarded
without
limitation
and
without
any
financial
dependence,
and--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--if
this--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--if
this--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--if
this
were
governed
by
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
there
would
be--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--only
a
pecuniary
loss.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
if
this
case
were
governed
by
varying
state
laws,
there
is
overwhelming
support
for
the
loss
of
society.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
well,
the
dohsa
has
been
applied
to
deaths
on
the
high
seas.
it
has
not
been
applied
in
a
warsaw
convention
case.
we
would
contend
that
the
treaty
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
we
do.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
well,
there
was...
there's
one
part
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
that
allows
you
under
7...
section
764
to
use
the
law
of
the
carrier.
that
may
be
one
possibility,
to
use
korean
law.
here,
the
exclusive
remedy
in
international
air
transport
is
the
warsaw
convention,
and
if
this
court
concludes
that
the
damages
under
the
warsaw
convention
are
not
to
be
controlled
by
their
plain
meaning,
or
not
to
be
controlled
by
french
civil
law
but
rather
by
the
law
of
the
united
states
or
the
local
law,
we
also
find
support,
and
we
find
support
in
general
maritime
law,
we
find
support
outside
of
the
straitjacket,
or
the
shackle
of
the
jones
act
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
well,
that
was
not
in
our
particular
case,
and
i
believe
they
were
talking
about
the
list
of
beneficiaries
and
who
are
the
proper
parties
to
bring
the
cas,
and
they
looked
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
for
that.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
i
believe
that
is
the
law
of
the
case.
i
believe
this
is
strictly
a
warsaw
convention
case,
and
the
phrase,
damage--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--for
korean
citizens
it
may
have
applied
in
some
factor.
we
think
in
this
case
that
korean...
the
nation
of
korea
was
not
involved
in
the
drafting
or
the
negotiation
of
the
warsaw
convention,
and
for
certain
korean
citizens
it
might.
in
our
case,
we
have
american
citizens
who
were
on
the
flight,
and
their
claim
for
loss
of
damage
sustained
finds
support
in
civil
rights
law.
there's
cases
under
1983
where
this
court
has
administered
remedies,
including
death
remedies,
from
the
common
law
going
outside
of
the
statutory
framework,
and
the
approach
by
korean
air
lines
to
make
this
a
dohsa
case,
to
make
this
a
jones
act
case,
is
simply
inappropriate.
the
jones
act
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
were
passed
in
1920.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
your
honor,
the
statute
passed
by
congress,
and
this
court
in
alves
said
that
it
was
hastily
enacted,
it
was
not
the
product
of
attentive
judicial
review,
and
was
merely
to
fill
a
gap
for
death
on
the
high
seas.
it
is
a
pecuniary
law
statute.
it
is
an
employment-related
compensation
statute
that
was
designed
to
compensate
the
bread-winner
who
may
have
been
injured
on
the
high
seas.
it
is
a
very
limited,
very
restrictive
statute
that
was
passed
to
fill
a
gap.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
i
relied
on
alves,
your
honor,
and
the
quote
from
alves
is
that--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--i
do,
your
honor.
the
citation
on
alves
is
446
u.s.
274,
and
the
particular
page,
on
page
282
to
283,
that
states
that
dohsa
and
the
jones
act
should
not
be
accorded
overwhelming
analogical
weight
in
formulating
remedies
under
general
maritime
law
because
they
were
hastily
enacted
within
days
of
each
other,
yet
are
hopelessly
inconsistent
and
not
the
product
of
attentive
judicial
review.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
that
was
1980,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
and
the
court--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--well,
in
miles
this
court
did
apply
it,
but
i
think
miles
is
very
distinguishable,
because
you
had
a
jones
act
seaman,
and
i
think
what
this
court
held
is,
when
you
have
a
jones
act
seaman,
and
he's
wearing
his
jones
act
seaman
hat,
then
whether
he's
in
the
territorial
waters
or
on
the
high
seas,
and
whether
it's
under
the
jones
act
or
general
maritime
law,
you're
going
to
treat
him
the
same
as
a
jones
act
seaman,
and
i
don't
think
that
extinguished
the
general
maritime
right
to
recover
loss
of
society
that
this
court
announced
in
gaudet,
and
this
court
went
on
to
say
in
alves
that
no
intention
appears
that
dohsa
has
the
effect
of
foreclosing
any
nonstatutory
federal
remedies
that
might
be
found
appropriate
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
general
maritime--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--that
is...
is
correct,
there
has
been
an
application
of
dohsa
to
air
crashes,
but
not
in
cases
where
the
warsaw
convention
controls.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--we
have
a
binding
treaty
obligation,
and
the
dohsa,
because
you
have
the
dohsa
for
certain
restrictive
kinds
of
deaths,
does
not
mean
that
that
trumps
the
treaty
obligation
that
comes
14
years
later.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
because
this
is
not
a
jones
act
seaman.
this
is
a
civilian.
this
is
a--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--i
think--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--well,
we
think
that
that's
in
error,
your
honor.
we
think
that--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
i
understood
that
it
was,
your
honor,
at
446
u.s.
274.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
all
right,
your
honor.
to
get
back
to
the
point
that
the
court's
addressing,
if
we're
going
to
look
at
domestic
law,
are
we
shackled
by
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
and
i
think
that
you
still--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--i
understand,
your
honor.
we
feel
as
if
the
other
side
is
attempting
to
do
that,
your
honor.
looking
at
it
more
fairly--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--in
the
united
states,
your
honor?
mr.
w.
paul
needham
there's
very
thin
jurisprudence,
and
i
would
contend--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--we
have
not
found
very
many
cases,
simply
because...
i
think
because
of
the
damage
cap.
what
generally
happens,
it's
such
a
minimal
amount
of
money,
if
there's
a
crash,
it
gets
paid,
and
it's
only
when
there's
wilful
misconduct
and
you
don't
have
a
damage
cap--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--the
law
that
we
would
contend
that
would
apply
under
american
law
is
federal
common
law.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
no.
it's
clear
from
the
drafting
of
the
treaty
that
you
must
have--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--i
would
think
without
the
convention,
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
very
ticklish
problem,
which
is--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--well,
i
think
in
this
case
there
is
a
convention,
and
the
convention
does
apply
in
this
case,
precisely
to
simplify
the
problem,
but
were
there
not
a
convention
it
would
be--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--under
those
assumptions
you
are
supposed
to
apply,
i
would
contend,
a
federal
common
law
so
you'll
have
a
uniformity
of
results
in
the
country
and
you
wouldn't
get
caught
in
this
hodge
podge
of
conflicting
state
death
statutes
of
one
kind
or
another.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
well,
that's
our
alternative
argument,
that
if
article
24
brings
us
back
to
the
united
states
for
our
law,
that
in
fact
it's
a
federal
common
law,
and
that
we
should
recover
under
the
federal
common
law.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
law
of
the
case.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
signed
the
warsaw
convention.
they
are
treaty-bound
to
follow
that
convention.
one
of
the
fundamental
purposes
of
that
convention
was
to
deter
wilful
misconduct.
in
this
case,
there
has
been
a
finding
of
wilful
misconduct.
at
the
time
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
passed
into
law,
there
was
no
contemplation
of
a
cap.
there
was
no
cap
of
any
kind,
and
in
this
particular
case,
when,
to
effectuate
the
purpose
of
this
treaty,
the
court
needs
to
have
a
deterrent
effect,
to
then
graft
on
to--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--well,
the
flight
crew,
and
that
gets
imputed
to
korean
air
lines,
which
is
the
defendant.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
w.
paul
needham
that's
absolutely
true,
but
even
then,
they
said
no
lid
when
there's
wilful
misconduct,
so
as
concerned
as
they
were
then
about
judgments--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--and
that...
that
is
this
case,
your
honor,
and
in
this
case,
to
award
loss
of
society,
and
we
believe
that
federal
common
law
is
correct,
we
believe
loss
of
society
is
there
in
federal
common
law,
and
we
believe
to
attach
a
financial
dependency
requirement
to
loss
of
society
is
inappropriate.
the
love
and
affection
and
mutual
benefit
you
have
in
a
family
does
not
depend
on
how
much
money
changes
hands,
and
we
disagree
with
the
financial
dependency--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--your
honor,
that
was
alternative
pleading.
we
had
a
very
detailed
complaint,
and
after
the
finding
of
wilful
misconduct
we
trimmed
it
up
and
made
it
very
clean.
the
defendants
insisted
it
was
a
death
on
the
high
sea
case.
it
was
merely
alternative
pleading.
you
can
see,
under
jurisdiction,
we
said
there
was
jurisdiction
under
the
warsaw
convention.
we
pled
the
warsaw
convention,
we
argued
consistently
the
warsaw
convention,
and
we--
mr.
w.
paul
needham
--i
think
that
count
was
either
dismissed,
or
there
was
no
finding.
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
not
on
count
i,
not
on
count
ii,
just
on
a
verdict
to
the
jury,
and
we
argued
our
first
count.
we
never
relied
on
the
second
count.
it
was
just
alternative
defensive
pleading,
your
honor.
and
we
would
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
be
affirmed
with
the
exception
that
there
not
be
a
financial
dependency
requirement
grafted
onto
the
loss
of
society.
thank
you.
