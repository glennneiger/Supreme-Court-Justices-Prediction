justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry.
i'm
just
not
quite
clear
on
your...
why
you
answered
that
we
must
decide
both
because
if
we
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
about
when
the
endangerment
must
be,
if
we
say
it
is
an
imminent,
yet-to-be-realized
danger,
why
do
we
have
to
answer
any
other
question?
the
ninth
circuit
is
then
reversed
and
your
client
has
no
responsibility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
can
decide
this
controversy
only.
we
decide
a
live
case
or
controversy.
and
your
controversy
is
over
once
you
prevail
on
the
point
that
there
was
at
the
time
this
action
was
taken,
that
the
suit
was
brought,
no
imminent
danger
of
any
kind.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
an
answer
to
the,
i
think,
main
criticism
of
your
reading
which
is
that
it
encourages
delay
on
the
part
of
the
person
on
the
spot?
it
says
to
that
person,
don't
clean
it
up
because
if
you
do,
it's
going
to
be
out
of
your
own
pocket.
instead,
let
the
contamination
increase
and
go
sue
somebody
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
you
went
somewhat
further,
and
let's
take
this
case
exactly,
what
the
dates
were.
the
contamination
was
discovered
in
october.
suppose
the
plaintiff
had
immediately
given
notice
to
the
defendant,
but
during
the
90-day
period
itself
under
pressure,
say,
from
town
authorities,
plaintiff
starts
cleaning
up
and
then
has
to
wait
those
90
days
to
bring
the
suit.
so,
by
the
time
we
get
to...
what
would
it
be?
february?
from
october
to
february.
the
plaintiff
has
already
incurred
a
substantial
sum.
then
from
the
time
the
suit
begins
in
february
until
march
when
the
cleanup
is
done,
plaintiff
incurs
further
expenses.
is
it
your
position
that
all
of
the
expenses
during
the
90-day
period
plus
after
suit
commences
are
reimbursable
or
only
after
the
suit
commences?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
didn't
they
use
the
same
words,
encompassing
words,
that
were
used
in
cercla?
i
think
you're
asking
us
to
interpret
this
provision
of
rcra
with
the
same
breadth
as
the
cercla
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
what
you
can
recover.
the
provision
for
reimbursement
for
cleanup
costs
is
broad
in
cercla,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here
there
is
no
similar
provision
that
says
for
what
you've
done
to
clean
it
up,
you
can
recover.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
thought
your
client
made
the
cleanup
because
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
city
of
los
angeles.
i
didn't
think
this
was
some
voluntary
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
city
said
you
had
to
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
still
have
some
state
causes
of
action
here
presumably.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
another
question
that
you
could
answer
that's
not
strictly
before
us?
why
was
there
no
effort
to
sue
anybody
until
after
the
cleanup
was
done?
that's
one
question.
and
the
other
is,
are
you
telling
us
that
unlike
state
law,
the
meghrigs,
even
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
contamination,
are
responsible
under
the
federal
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
under
the
federal
statute
that
says,
has
contributed
or
who
is
contributing?
these
are
people
who
say...
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
what
they
say
is
correct...
we
didn't...
during
our
period
of
ownership,
we
didn't
have
a
clue
that
there
was
any
petroleum
involved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
just
let's
assume
i
said
that
they're
correct,
that
the
gas
station
long
preceded
their
ownership
of
this
property,
that
they
did
not
contribute
to
the
contamination.
they
were
not
operating
a
gas
station.
it
was
a
vacant
lot
while
they
were
owners.
are
they
nonetheless
contributors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
under
this
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was...
discovery
wasn't
made
until...
that
your
client
wanted
to
do
this
building.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
if
you
can
go
to
my
other
question.
what
impeded
you
faced
with
this
statute
that
says
"may
present"
from
beginning
suit
at
the
earliest
possible
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
not
according
to
the
government's
interpretation.
the
government
said
as
long
as
you
did
your
cleanup
within
the
90-day
period,
as
the
government
reads
the
statute,
you
would
be
entitled
to
reimbursement.
so,
my
question
is
why
timely
suit
wasn't
commenced
and
cleanup
commenced
instead
of
saying,
we'll
do
the
whole
thing
and
then
we'll
attempt
to
sue
for
past--
