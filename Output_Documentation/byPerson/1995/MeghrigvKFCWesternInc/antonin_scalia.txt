justice

scalia
or
alternatively,
we
could
attack
it
from
the
other
direction
and
could
determine
that
there's
no
cause
of
action
for
money
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
or
not
this
thing
was
prior
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
way
is...
the
second
point
is
the
one
on
which
there
is
the
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
trying
to
take
the
high
ground,
as
i
understand
it.
[laughter]
you
think
that
the
more
defensible
principle
is
a
principle
that
not
only
lets
your
client
win,
but
let's
some
other
people
win.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
not
only
want
to
win,
you
want
to
win
on
the
basis
of
a
correct
principle,
which
is
what
you're
arguing.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
zaimes,
your
second...
i
mean,
we
may
be
unfair
to
you
in
severing
the
two
points
as
though
they
don't
overlap.
as
i
understand
it,
part
of
your
argument
with
regard
to
the
damages
point
hinges
upon
your
assertion
that
this
is
a
statute
that
is
only
intended
to
prevent
future
harm.
it
is
not
intended
to
remedy
for
past
harm.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
breyer
just
posed
to
you,
what
you
were
doing
is
reimbursing
the
plaintiff
for
that
past
damage
that
he's
incurred
for
putting
up
the
barrier.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
that
if
we
take
the
first
point
in
the
case.
there's
no
doubt
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
that.
once...
although
he's
put
up
the
barrier,
once
all
of
the
oil
pollution
next
door
has
been
eliminated,
he
has
no
cause
of
action
at
all,
neither
for
putting
up
the
barrier
nor
for
anything
else.
and
part
of
your
argument
is
that
these
two
halves
go
together.
when
you
understand
that
the
statute
is
only
intended
to
remedy
for
future
harm,
there's
no
sense
in
allowing
a
court
to
give
damages
for
something
that
happened
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
given
your
position
on
the
first
point
as
to
whether
the
statute
is
directed
only
to
the
prevention
of
future
harm,
extant
threats,
that
the
phrase
"as
may
be
necessary"
must
reasonably
be
read
to
mean
as
may
be
necessary
to
achieve
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
which
is
not
to
reimburse
for
past
expenses
but
to
prevent
future
harms.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
you--
--is
that
your
reading?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
didn't
take
this
case
to
get
rid
of
the
case.
we
took
the
case
principally
i
think...
at
least
i
did...
to
resolve
the
circuit
conflict,
which
doesn't
exist
on
this
point
but
rather
exists
on
the
second
point.
why
isn't
it
perfectly
valid
to
attack
the
second
point
as
to
whether
money
damages
are
recoverable?
and
in
the
course
of...
i...
at
least
i
think
that
in
order
to
decide
that
second
point
correctly,
you
have
to
incidentally
reach
the
first
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
not
just
an
injustice,
but
an
injustice
that
is
related
to
eliminating
a...
an
extant
threat
to
the
environment.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
hear
you
now
and
as
i
heard
mr.
zaimes'
concession
in
oral
argument,
i
don't
think
you're
disagreeing
with
mr.
zaimes
on
this
point
anymore,
as
you
seemed
to
be
originally.
that
is,
he
seemed
to
be
taking
the
position
in
the
briefs
that
you
couldn't
get
money,
period.
now
i
think
he's
acknowledged
that
you
can
get
money
so
long
as
it
is
in
connection
with
an
order
for
somebody
to
remedy
a
threat
to
the
environment.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
that's
necessary
to
achieve
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
money...
the
cleanup
that
has
been
done
with
money
already
spent?
those
are
some
costs.
that
cleanup
has
been
done.
you
don't
achieve
anything
by
paying
the
person
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
this
statute.
not
in
this
statute
because
you
acknowledge
that
so
long
as
the
entire
cleanup
has
been
done
before
suit
is
lodged,
you
get
none
of
your
money
back.
or
at
least
before
the
90-day
notice
is
given.
you
draw
the
line
at
the
90-day
notice.
you
acknowledged
that
if
i
do
somebody
else's
cleanup
and
complete
it
entirely
so
that
there's
no
more
harm
to
the
environment,
i
cannot
get
anything
under
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
that
was
the
concession.
i
think
the
concession
was
that
the
court
could
issue
an
order
which
tells
you
to
clean
it
up
and
requires
the
other
party
to
pay
you
for
your
cleanup.
that's
not
here.
no,
he
hasn't
conceded
that
he
owes
you
any
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
he
conceded
is
that
a
court
could
issue
an
order
allowing
the
party
now
in
possession
of
the
property
to
clean
up
the
hazard,
the
extant
hazard,
and
saying,
when
you
clean
it
up,
you
will
be
paid
for...
it
will
be
paid
for
by
the
other
party.
but
that's
not
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
after
the
case
is
pending.
but
that...
you
know,
after
the
case
is
pending
and
there
is
still
cleanup
to
be
done,
the
court
could
order
that.
i
tend
to
agree
with
you.
but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
the
cleanup
was
done
years
ago
before
the
suit
was
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
to
remedy...
not
to
shift
money
around
with
respect
to
past
threats.
present
and
future,
but
not
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
might
have
enacted
a
different
statute.
is
that
what
you're
asking?
would
i
have
enacted
this
one
or
a
different
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
now,
what
about
subsection
1
which
you
say
sets
forth
the
conditions?
what
about
1(b)?
it
seems
to
me
1(b)
makes
no
sense
except
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
a
statute
which
deals
with
pending
threats.
that
is,
it
says,
no
action
may
be
commenced
under
section
(a)(1)(a):
a,
prior
to
60
days,
or
b,
no
action
may
be
commenced
if
the
administrator
or
state
has
commenced
and
is
diligently
prosecuting
a
civil
or
criminal
action
in
a
court
of
the
united
states
to
require
compliance
with
such
permit,
standard,
regulation,
condition,
requirement,
prohibition--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
would
you
eliminate
somebody's
cause
of
action
for
past
damages
so
long
as
a
state
is
pursuing
a
remedy
to
enjoin
any
future
violation?
it
makes
no
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
just
bad
english.
we
do
not
assume
that
congress
uses
bad
english.
i
mean,
to
convey
the
thought
you've
just
expressed,
they
would
have
said
may
exist
or
may
have
existed.
what
you're
saying
may
exist
means...
simply
there's
a
possibility.
there
is
or
was
a
possibility.
but
that's
not
how
we
say
that
in
english.
the
way
we
say
that
in
english
is
may
exist
or
may
have
existed.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
we
say
may
exist,
we
mean...
what
we
mean
is
may
exist,
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
missed
my
point.
my
point
is
there
is
no
ambiguity,
not
if
you're
speaking
english.
may
exist
or
may
have
existed
is
the
meaning
you
say
may
exist
conveys.
it
does
not
convey
that
meaning.
