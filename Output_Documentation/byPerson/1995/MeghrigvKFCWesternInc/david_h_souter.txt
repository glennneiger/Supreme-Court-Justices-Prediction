david
h.
souter
what
if
the
court
makes
exactly
such
an
order
and
says,
defendant,
stop
what
you're
doing
now,
clean
up?
and
the
defendant
doesn't
either
because
the
defendant
can't
get
its
hands
on
the
money
to
pay
for
it
or
is
just
contumacious
and
whatnot.
can
the
plaintiff
at
that
point
come
in
and
say,
all
right,
you've
made
a
perfectly
proper
order
here,
but
nothing
is
getting
done?
authorize
me
to,
in
effect,
take
whatever
steps
i
can
take
to
abate
and
to
clean
up
simply
to
discharge
the
responsibility
which
is
ultimately
upon
this
other
party.
under
those
circumstances,
could
the
plaintiff
get...
and
the
court
says,
yes,
all
right,
go
ahead.
under
those
circumstances,
could
the
plaintiff
get
restitution?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
would
still
win
the
case
if
that
were
the
rule
here,
wouldn't
you,
if
we
accept
your
position
on--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you'd
still
win
the
case
if
that
were
the
rule
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we're
not
adjudicating
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
talking
about
rcra,
and
under
the
rcra
claim,
you
would
win,
would
you
not,
on
my
assumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you
want
a
broader
rule
than
the
rule
that
it
would
take
you
to
win
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
assume
you're
here
arguing
your
client's
case,
not
bringing
interesting
issues
to
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
client
would
win
on
the
position
that
i
have
suggested,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
would
end
this
lawsuit.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
justice
scalia
just
set
out
a
position.
is...
i
thought...
at
one
point
i
thought
that
was
the
way
you
read
it.
is
that
the
way
you
read
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
is
what
circumscribes
the
court's
power
as
a
court
of
equity
to
make
orders
and
provide
remedies.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
that
is
the...
i
didn't
mean
to
take
your
question
away
from
you.
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
take
it.
if
that
is
the
case,
then
why
shouldn't
your
answer
to
my
first
question
be
different?
because
the
assumption
in
my
first
question
is
we
have
in
fact
a
situation
which
is
presenting
imminent
harm
here.
the
court
says,
stop
it.
stop
doing
what
you're
doing.
clean
up
enough
so
that
there
is
no
further
imminence
of
harm.
the
threat
will
be
gone.
the
defendant
says
no
or
simply
does
not
do
it.
all
the
plaintiff
wants
is
to
get
to
that
point
which
the
court
had
every
authority
to
order
the
defendant
to
reach.
and
so,
the
plaintiff
says,
let
me
clean
up
and
then
give
me
restitution
for
doing
what
you
had
the
authority
to
order
the
defendant
to
do.
why
doesn't
a
court
have
that
authority?
take
it,
mr.
zaimes.
justice
david
h.
souter
good.
