mr.
daniel
romano
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
in
light
of
the
concessions
that
were
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
i
believe
that
about
one-half
of
my
argument
is
no
longer
necessary.
as
i
understand
the
petitioners'
viewpoint
now,
assuming
that
we've
complied
with
the
statute,
then
we
are
entitled
to
seek
equitable
restitution
under
the
statute
if
the
reimbursement
cost
and
the
cleanup
action
that
we
took
was,
quote,
necessary
under
the
statute.
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
daniel
romano
the
court--
mr.
daniel
romano
--in
other
words,
availability
of
restitutionary
remedies
is
present
in
the
statute,
and
this
is
about
one-half
of
our
argument.
now,
how
do
we
go
about--
mr.
daniel
romano
--that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
romano
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
opinion
in
cort
v.
ash
really
does
not
address
the
issue
over
here.
the
opinion
in
cort
v.
ash
dealt
with
whether
or
not
the
court
should
imply
a
private
cause
of
action
from
a
statute.
what
we
have
over
here,
we
have
a
cause
of
action
which
was
presumed
to
exist
under
the
statute
in
light
of
the
porter
decisions
and
franklin
decision
which
congress
is
presumed
to
have
known
about
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
the
statute.
the
language
of
the
statute
in
porter
and
the
franklin
cases
and
in
this
case
are
virtually
identical.
they
grant
the
court
to...
authority
to
issue
such
other
order
as
may
be
necessary.
this
language
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
the
precedent
that
we
cited
to
include
all
available
equitable
relief.
mr.
daniel
romano
no.
it's
explicit.
mr.
daniel
romano
precisely,
your
honor.
that's
why
we
say
we're
dealing
here
with
an
explicit
grant
of
jurisdiction
and
authorization
for
any
person,
citizen,
to
commence
an
action
on
his
own
behalf
against
all
of
the
named
defendants
under
the
conditions
stated
in
the
statute.
so,
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
cort
v.
ash,
and
this
is
where
the
eighth
circuit
was
wrong.
now,
we
say
that
under
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
court
can
do
a
number
of
things.
they
can
issue
a
prohibitory
injunction.
it
can
issue
an
mandatory
injunction
ordering
in
fact
the
cleanup
of
the
property
by
the
defendant,
and
this
point
is
considered
by
the
defendants.
we
say
it
is
a
very
small
step
from
there
to
allow
the
court
to
say
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
if
appropriate
and
if
necessary,
you,
plaintiff,
go
out,
clean
the
property,
and
then
you
will
obtain
reimbursement
from
this
defendant.
mr.
daniel
romano
justice
scalia,
let
me
respond
to
some
comments
you
made
which
bear
on
this
point.
earlier
you
stated
i
believe
that
it
was
your
view
of
the
statute
that
it
applies
to
prevent
future
contamination.
but
if...
in
fact
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
objectives
stated
in
rcra
itself,
section...
42
u.s.c.
6902(b),
the
congress
said
it
is
the
intent...
the
national
policy
of
the
united
states...
and
i'm
skipping
ahead
over
here...
to
minimize
the
present
and
the
future
threat
to
human
health
and
the
environment.
this
is
what
we
did
in
this
case.
so,
the
only
issue
is--
mr.
daniel
romano
--the
issue
is
that
is
presented
before
this
court
is
what
should
a
property
owner
do
upon
the
discovery
of
contamination
on
his
property.
now,
he
can
do
one
of
two
things.
and
we
have
to
assume,
in
the
context
of
this
decision,
that
that
contamination
presents
an
imminent
hazard
condition.
now,
what
does
that
mean?
it
means
he
has
a...
drums
of
toxic
waste
leaking
to
the
groundwater.
it
means
that
there
is
a
condition
whereby
there
is
a
discharge
into
the
soil
where
children
are
playing.
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
potential
explosive
conditions
that
need
to
be
abated.
would
you
rather
have
a
plaintiff
take
care
of
those
conditions
and
then
seek
his
response
later,
or
would
you
like
him
to
go
to
court?
the
answer
to
this...
provides--
mr.
daniel
romano
--no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
this
is
precisely
what
congress
has
enacted
by--
mr.
daniel
romano
--justice
ginsburg,
this
is
a
very
different
statute
from
cercla,
and
in
fact
it
is
unique.
no
other
statute
is
found
in
the
environmental
laws
of
the
united
states
which
allows
a
citizen
to
proceed
and
file
and
deal
with
an
imminent
hazard
condition.
cercla
doesn't
have
that.
a
citizen--
mr.
daniel
romano
--yes.
mr.
daniel
romano
we
believe
that
congress...
congress
could
have
put
the
imminent
hazard/endangerment
provision
in
cercla.
it
did
not.
it
put
it
in
rcra
so
that
the
broadest
possible
remedies
will
be
available
to
deal
with
conditions
of
imminent
and
hazard
endangerments.
now,
if
congress
put
that
statute
in
cercla,
it
would
only
apply,
justice
ginsburg,
to
substances
covered
by
cercla
which
is
hazardous
substances.
congress
well
understood
that
environmental
contamination
which
may
lead
to
imminent
and
hazardous
conditions
may
arise
not
only
from
hazardous
substances,
but
also
from
solid
waste
and
hazardous
waste,
substances
which
are
not
covered
by
cercla.
moreover,
congress
has
understood
that
petroleum
contamination
is
not
covered
by
cercla,
yet
may
present
an
imminent
hazard
condition.
we
believe
that's
why
congress
put
that
statute
in
rcra
not
in
cercla.
there
was
a
reason
for
why
congress
did
that.
mr.
daniel
romano
well,
i
believe
that
under
the
proper
circumstances
this
particular
individual
may
recover
his...
may
obtain
equitable
restitution
of
his
environmental
cleanup
costs,
those
costs
that
were
necessary,
in
the
words
of
the
statute--
mr.
daniel
romano
--we
don't
believe
that
the
condition
of
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
has
to
be
present
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit.
now,
we
believe
that
the
statute
supports
us
on
this
issue.
when
congress
wanted
to
put
a
limitation
on
the
timing
of
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
in
this
statute,
it
imposed
them
in
section
b
of
the
statute.
congress
said
no
action
may
be
commenced
until
several
things
have
happened.
one,
you
could
provide
notice
to
the
state,
to
the
epa,
and
to
all
the
responsible
parties,
and
then
if
within
a
period
of
90
days
the
epa
or
the
state
does
not
commence
any
remedial
activities,
then
you
may
go
to
court
and
file
a
lawsuit.
mr.
daniel
romano
which?
that...
the
limitation
of
the
endangerment
is
not
temporal.
for
sure
an
endangerment
has
to
exist
at
the
time
of
the
cleanup,
otherwise
we
will
not
be
here.
but
assuming
that
an
endangerment
exists
at
some
point
in
time,
then
should
the
person
at
that
time
file
legal
proceedings,
send
notice?
in
many
cases
there
are
literally
hundreds
of
defendants
that
are--
mr.
daniel
romano
--your
honor,
the
only
words
that
even
hint
on
that
is
the
language
"may
present"
which,
granted,
is
in
the
present
tense.
we
think
that--
mr.
daniel
romano
--your
honor--
mr.
daniel
romano
--if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
it
deals
with
violation
of
standards
or
permit
conditions
or
so
forth.
this
is
not
what
we're
dealing
in
this
lawsuit.
the
rcra
citizen
supervision
is
divided
into
two
parts.
part
(a)(1)(a)
which
deals
with
lawsuits
commenced
by
citizens
to
enjoin
violations
which
are
alleged
to...
against
defendants
which
are
alleged
to
be
in
violation.
this
is
a
lawsuit
which
is
similar
to
many
other
statutes
found
throughout
the
environmental
laws,
and
they
are
aimed
into
enforcement
of
the
regulatory
aspect
of
the
statute.
the
statute
we're
dealing
with
today
is
a
very
different
species
of
citizen
supervision.
it
is
unique
and
it
is
a
liability
statute.
and
it
says
now
under...
it
allows
a
party
to
initiate
proceedings
when
the
conditions
of
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
exist.
so,
the
question
is,
does
the
"may"
language,
"may
present"
language...
is
it
a
language
which
is
temporal
in
it
or
is
it
really
something
else?
we
believe
it's
something
else.
it
is
necessary
to
limit
the
whole
universe
of
solid
and
hazardous
waste,
about
the
broadest
universe
of
substances
you
can
imagine,
to
those
ones
which
may
present
an
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment.
mr.
daniel
romano
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
romano
--i
understand
that
there
is
for
sure...
for
sure
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
and
we
believe
that
our
reading
of
the
statute--
mr.
daniel
romano
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
when
congress
wanted
to
put
limitations
on
when
such
lawsuits
should
be
filed,
it
put
them
under
the
actions
prohibited
section.
that
language
is
not
found
over
there.
what
the
petitioners
are
arguing
is
take
some
language
which
we
believe
is
out
of
context.
it's
a
descriptive
language
defining
the
type
of
waste
that
presents
the
hazard
conditions
and
reading
that
into
the
jurisdictional
section
of
the
statute
which
comes
later
on.
mr.
daniel
romano
you
can
bring
an
action
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
against
all
past
and
present
owners...
not
owners,
transporters,
basically
all
the
group
of
defendants
which
are
alleged
to
have
contributed
in
some
fashion
to
the
contamination
of
the
property.
and
congress
has
clearly
stated
that
under
the
statute
it
is
the
desire
of
congress
to
have
all
of
these
defendants
share
equitably
in
the
cleanup
of
the
contamination.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
any
other
reading
of
the
statute,
the
reading
urged
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
will
lead
to
what
we
believe
will
be
perverse
results
because
the
bottom
line
is
you
have
a
property
owner
which
is...
has
discovered
a
condition
of
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
of
his
property.
what
you
want
him
to
do
to
preserve
his
legal
rights,
he
will
not
really
have
absolutely
no
incentive
to
do
any
cleanup
activities
whatsoever
on
the
property.
mr.
daniel
romano
your
honor,
there
was
actually
never
an
order.
what
the
city--
mr.
daniel
romano
--the
city
said
if
you
want
to
build
your
restaurant
on
this
property,
you
better
take
care
of
that
problem.
and
what
my
client
did
is
voluntarily
go
out
and
investigate
the
nature
of
the
problem,
only
to
find
out
that
the
extent
of...
that,
a,
the
problem
was
petroleum
contamination,
but
to
make
matters
worse,
it...
the
bottom
pile
of
petroleum
actually
hit
the
groundwater
beneath
the
property.
that's
what
we
believe
contributed
to
the
conditions
of
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment.
at
that
time
the
court
has
to
ask
ourself,
what
should...
that
is
the
critical
point
in
time
here.
mr.
daniel
romano
your
honor,
our
experience
in
this
case
is
that
we
actually
do
not.
we
are
now
pending
for
the
second
time
in
the
court
of
appeals
before
the
state
of
california,
and
we
don't
think
the
state
remedies
are...
have
much
meaning.
but
even
if
they
did,
the
statute
does
not
specifically
state
that
a
citizen
may
proceed
an
action
under
this
section
without
regard
to
any
other
available
remedies.
there's
a
savings
clause.
the
legislative
history
specifically
says
you
do
not...
plaintiff
does
not
need
to
exhaust
all
other
remedies
before
it
commences
a
lawsuit
under
this
section.
mr.
daniel
romano
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
romano
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
daniel
romano
no,
we
do
not.
we
do
not
want
damages.
mr.
daniel
romano
your
honor,
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
we
are
relying...
we
are
entitled
to
obtain
restitution
from
the
meghrigs
is
really
not
before
the
court
today.
if
the
court
in
fact
agrees
with
us
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
may,
using
equitable
principles,
decide
whether
or
not
we're
entitled
to
restitution.
mr.
daniel
romano
your
honor,
in
response
to
the
second
question,
we
believe
that
the
meghrigs
are
responsible
under
state
law,
and
in
fact
that's
why
we
took
an
appeal
from
that
order
that
was
attached
to...
as
an
exhibit...
an
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
daniel
romano
that
in
fact
we
believe
is
incorrect.
now,
we're
talking
about
facts,
your
honor,
which
are
outside
of
the
record
and
based
on
discovery
that
we
obtained
in
the
state
court
proceedings...
and
i'm
happy
to
talk
about
those.
they're
not
in
this--
mr.
daniel
romano
--under
state
law?
mr.
daniel
romano
they
may
well
be
deemed
to
have
contributed
under
the
federal
statute
if
they
had
discovered
the
presence
of
contamination
on
the
property
and
did
absolutely
nothing
about
it,
which
the
facts...
that's
what
the
fact
show.
mr.
daniel
romano
discovery
by
my
client
wasn't
made,
but
we
had
found
that
there
was...
we
believe
that
certainly
the
meghrigs'
agents,
their
father
and
the
contractor
that
was
managing
the
property
on
their
behalf,
they
are
the
entities
that
removed
the
underground
tanks.
and
we
have
photographs
which
showed
what
that
soil
looked
like.
the
soil
clearly
looked
very
heavily
contaminated.
so,
we
believe
that
the
meghrigs
knew
or
certainly
should
have
known
about
the
fact
of
contamination
on
the
property.
they
just
never--
mr.
daniel
romano
--we
were
faced
with
a
situation
where
the
issue
was
either
go
to
federal
court
and
litigate
this
for
opinion
order,
at
the
very
minimum
90
days
but
more
likely
several
months
or
years
down
the
line,
maybe
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
before
we
could
do
anything
about
the
property.
meanwhile
my
client--
mr.
daniel
romano
--i
think
that
the
short
answer
to
that
one,
your
honor,
is
that
at
the
time
that
my
client
found
out
about
the
contamination,
he
was
more
concerned
about
taking
care
of
the
problem
as
opposed
to
suing
people
for
recovery
of
his
cleanup
costs.
mr.
daniel
romano
and...
thank
you.
[laughter]
mr.
daniel
romano
well,
the
government
makes...
the
government's
position
is
an
interesting
position
because...
we
don't
agree
with
that,
obviously,
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
is
that
the
government
says,
okay,
if
you
find
contamination,
what
you
do
is
you
have
to
start
providing
notices
to
people,
assuming
you
can
locate
all
of
those
people,
before
you
do
any
cleanup
activities.
only
you...
only
after
you
provided
notice
to
all
of
the
defendants
can
you
then
follow
with
the
filing
of
a
lawsuit.
we
believe
that
such
a
reading
of
the
statute
will
really
contravene
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
statute
which
is
if
you
have
a
condition
which
is
by
definition
the
worst
type
of
environmental
contamination,
what
you
would
want
to
do
is
clean
it
up
and
then
work
out
the
details
as
to
who
is
responsible.
and
i
would
say
that
principles
of
equity
which
govern
the
statute
provide
all
of
the
necessary
restrictions
on
enlarging
this
kind
of
action.
a
district
court
on
remand
can
decide
and
hold
that
we
acted
as
an
officious
inter-meddlers.
a
district
court
can
decide
that
the
costs
that
we've
incurred
were
not
necessary,
and
the
district
court
may
decide
that
we
set
on
our
rights
and
laches
is
available.
certainly
i
don't
think
people
will
be
bringing
those
kind
of
lawsuits
without...
if
they
didn't
have
any
merit
to
them
when
they're
facing
with
an
attorney's
fees
and
cost
penalty
in
the
event
if
they
lose
the
lawsuit.
so,
we
believe
that
it
is
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
hold
that
a
plaintiff
may,
in
the
limited
circumstances
where
the
contamination
presents
