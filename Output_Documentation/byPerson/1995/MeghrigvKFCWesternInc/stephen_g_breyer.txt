create

justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
the
ninth
circuit
create
the
split
on
the
question
of
when
the
endangerment
had
to
take
place?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
to
go
to
the
correct
principle,
how
could
you
in
fact
interpret
this
statute
to
say
that
a
plaintiff
could
never
get
monetary
damages?
suppose
the
gasoline
station
next
to
you
is
in
fact
right
now
leaking
gasoline
through
your
wall
killing
your
chickens
or
whatever,
and
what
you
do
is
you
have
to
put
up
a
barrier
to
stop
it.
and
at
the
same
time,
you
run
into
court
and
you
say
enjoin
it.
so,
the
court
says,
enjoin
it.
you
say
i've
spent
$50,000
on
the
gasoline
barrier
to
keep
my
chickens
safe,
and
i'd
like
to
be
reimbursed
for
that.
are
you
saying
that
that
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
give
you
the
little
extra
money
that
you
needed
in
order
to
take
immediate
action
within
a
few
hours
in
order
to
stop
all
your
livestock
from
dying
or
whatever?
i
mean,
normally
in
equity
i
think
that
kind
of
restitution
would
be
normal.
so,
what's
the
argument
on
the
merits
that
this
statute
wouldn't
give
you
that,
even
though
that's
not
in
this
case
at
all,
a
totally
hypothetical?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
word
in
the
statute
is
"necessary",
and
how
would
you
say
that
that
kind
of
normal
equitable
relief,
which
is
the
principle
you
want
to
argue
for,
never
could
be
necessary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
may
be...
why
isn't
it
necessary
in
the
circumstance,
given
the
history
of
equity,
et
cetera,
to
make
at
least
the
monetary
restitution
necessary
to
clear
up
the
absolute
immediate
emergency
action
that
the
plaintiff
took
in
order
to
save
the
lives
of
his
livestock?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
that.
that's
why
i
say...
you
were
arguing
for
the
proposition
never,
and
that's
what's
bothering
me.
never.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
once
you
say
that,
then
aren't
you
back
into
a
line
drawing
problem.
the
statute
doesn't
give
a
damages
remedy.
that's
true.
but
a
statute
may
give
a
remedy
to
require
a
person
to
pay
money
to
the
plaintiff
insofar
as
that's
an
equitable
action
related
to
the
basic
cleaning
up
of
the
spill.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
exactly
how
to
draw
that
line,
but
the
line
between
the
equitable
remedy
for
money,
which
is
ancillary
to
the
injunction,
and
damages
action
would
seem
the
right
line,
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
isn't
that
make
sense?
that
is
to
say,
i
take
it
the
reason
you
lost
in
state
court
is
because
the
state
court
found
that
the
meghrigs
never
undertook
any
acts
which
caused
gasoline
contamination
on
the
property.
and
so,
if
you
want
a
damages
action,
perhaps
you
should
have
to
go
against
the
people
who
caused
the
problem.
but
if
you
want
a
cleanup
action,
perhaps
it's
a
better
idea
to
get
a
broader
category
of
people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
would
argue
then
against
using
this
statute
simply
to
try
to
get
damages
for
something
that's
over
and
done
with
in
the
past.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
how
would
you
win?
because
you're
trying
to
sue
against
something
that
happened
in
the
past.
so,
i
mean,
maybe
i
don't
understand
it,
but
you're
trying
to
get...
you're
trying
to
go
against
some
people
whom
the
state
found
didn't
cause
the
contamination
but,
nonetheless,
they
did
handle
the
gasoline
in
the
past
and
it
all
was
a
problem
in
the
past.
but
you
want
to
get
damages
from
them
now,
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you're
calling
restitution,
but
i
mean,
you
want
to
be
reimbursed
from
them
who
didn't
cause
the
problem
for
your
expenditure.
and
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
it
would
make
sense
to
let
you
get
the
reimbursement
from
a
person
who
did
cause
the
problem,
which
is
what
the
state
court
would
allow,
but
not
necessarily
to
get
reimbursement
for
a
past
event
from
people
who
are
basically
innocent,
which
is
what
you
want
to
interpret
the
federal
statute
to
allow.
