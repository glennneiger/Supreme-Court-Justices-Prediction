mr.
john
p.
zaimes
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
after
all
the
briefing
on
a
wide
range
of
issues,
remains
a
statutory
interpretation
case,
and
the
guidance
that
this
court
has
previously
given
on
how
to
resolve
such
cases,
particularly
where
congress
has
provided
strict...
excuse
me...
direct
indications
of
its
intent
in
several
ways,
we
think
charts
a
very
clear
path
for
how
the
case
should
be
resolved.
let
me
digress
for
just
a
moment
to
talk
about
the
facts
in
this
case
that
are
at
this
stage
undisputed.
they
are...
this
is
still
a
pleading
case,
notwithstanding
the
many
twists
and
turns
that
it
has
been
through.
the
case
concerns
a
small
commercial
property
located
on
a
street
corner
in
los
angeles
that
was
owned
by
petitioners
from
1963
to
1975.
the
petitioners
sold
the
property
to
respondent
in
1975.
respondent
had
been
a
tenant
on
the
property
for
about
10
years
before
that,
since
1965,
and
had
operated
a
kentucky
fried
chicken
store
on
the
property.
in
1988
respondent
decided
that
it
would
bulldoze
that
kentucky
fried
chicken
store
and
bulldoze
also
the
strip
mall
that
was
alongside
it
and
put
a
brand
new
store
on
the
property...
it
was
going
to
be
a
two-story,
art
deco,
specially
designed
store...
and
in
the
course
of
that
work
discovered
contamination
on
the
property
by
refined
petroleum
product.
that
was
in
october
1988.
the
respondent
fully
cleaned
up
the
contamination
in
a
matter
of
months,
by
march
1989,
and
gave
notice
to
petitioners
under
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
what
we
call
rcra
in
shorthand,
in
may
1990.
it
was
not,
though,
until
december
1991,
more
than
3
years
after
the
contamination
had
been
discovered,
that
respondent
commenced
its
first
action
in
state
court
alleging
in
toto
10
different
causes
of
action,
most
of
them
sounding
in
common
law,
but
two
under
state
statutes.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
it
was
done
pursuant
to...
it
was
done
under
the
supervision
of
the
county
of
los
angeles,
department
of
health
services.
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
an
order
in
effect
at
the
time
that
the
cleanup
was
done,
but
they
had
general
oversight--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--i
believe
it
had.
i
believe
it
had.
the--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--i'm
not
sure
if
that
is
an
allegation
of
the
complaint,
but
i
believe
that
that
would
have
been
the
state
of
facts
at
the
time
that
the
cleanup
was
done.
after
two
successful
demurrers
by
petitioners,
that
case
went
up
on
appeal
to
the
state
court
and
this
action
was
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
in
la
alleging
a
single
cause
of
action
under
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act.
that
was
in
may
1992.
now,
it
is
congress'
intent
in
the
citizen
supervision
of
that
statute
that
we
are
here
to
determine,
and
we
believe
that
the
congressional
intent
derives
from
several
sources,
including
the
plain
words
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
the
statute,
other
related
sections
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
itself--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--yes.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
i
am
going
to
address
both
of
those
issues.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
i
believe
you
do
need
to
decide
both,
and
the
primary
reason
that
you
need
to
decide
both
is
that
part
of
the
way
that
this
case
has
come
to
this
court
is
that
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circuits.
the
ninth
circuit
has
fundamentally
determined
that
as
to
the
second
issue,
what
type
of
relief
is
available
under
the
statute,
that
a
cost
recovery
action
may
be
pursued.
the
eighth
circuit
has
determined
precisely
the
opposite.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
that
is
the
question
on
which
there
is
a
split
of
authority.
it
is
less
clear
that
there's
a
split
on
the
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer?
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
my
recollection
of...
the
ninth
circuit
says
the
endangerment
can
be
in
the
past
or
in
the
present.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
eighth
circuit
reached
the
issue
of
whether
it
has
to
be
past
or
present
directly.
it
relied
more
on
the
cort
v.
ash
analysis
of
whether
there
was
an
implied
right
of
action
for
damages
in
the
case.
in
addition
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
we
have
legislative
history--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--well,
that
resolves
the
situation,
justice
ginsburg,
for
my
client
i
agree.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
resolves
the
remainder
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
if
you
were
to
only
reverse--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--that
would
resolve
this
case
fully.
and
the
reason--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--that
is
true.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
you
could
resolve
it
that
way
also.
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor
was
that
because
there
is
the
conflict...
i
was
keying
off
of--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--the
second
point
is
the
one
on
which
there
is
the
clear
conflict,
yes.
now,
in
addition,
i
will
say
that
this
case
has
engendered
a
considerable
amount
of
activity
just
since
the
ninth
circuit
came
down.
this
is...
and
i
am
speaking
outside
the
record,
but
as
a
matter
of
policy,
if
the
court
wanted
to
resolve
the
issue
of
the...
of
what
rcra
entitles
a
person
to
do,
it
could
reach
both
issues
for
the
reason
that
if
it
only
resolves
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment,
then
the
likelihood
of
there
being
recurring
issues
on
what
type
of
relief
is
available
is
going
to
be
great.
but
the
fundamental
reason
is
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circuit
but,
justice
scalia--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--this
is
before...
this
is
an
order
that
the
defendant
would
clean
it
up
now
or
the
order
would
say,
plaintiff,
you
may
clean
it
up
and
we
are
going
to
order
defendant
to
pay
that?
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
either
way?
in
the
first
instance,
if
the
order
were
simply
defendant...
plaintiff
will
clean
it
up
and
defendant
will
reimburse,
i
don't
believe
that
they're...
that
the
court
is
entitled
to
issue
that
sort
of
order
because
what
the
statute
says
is
the
district
court
may
restrain
or
order
such
person
to
take
such
other
action.
what
is
contemplated
by
that
is
that
the
defendant
is
going
to
undertake
the
cleanup,
not
that
some
money
damage
award
is
going
to
issue.
and
that's
the
fundamental
basis
of
our
position
in
the
case.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
i'm
not...
i
don't
believe
that
it
could
under
this
statute.
now,
bear
in
mind
this
is
one
statute
and
this
is
one
remedy
in
a
broad
array
of
remedies
that
are
available,
so
while
we're
focusing
on
this
statute
and
what
it
provides--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--i--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--justice
souter,
i
believe
that
i
would
win
on
the
rcra
claim.
i
believe
that
i
would
lose
on
several
other
claims.
i
would
lose
on
the
state...
any
of
several
state
law
claims.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
i
understand
that.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
the
way
this
statute
is
framed,
i
believe
that
i
would
win
in
that
sort
of
situation
because--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--well,
i'm
seeking
in
some...
and
we
touched
on
this
in
the
context
of
the
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment.
the
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
issue
disposes
of
my
case,
but--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--that's
right.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
it
would.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
it
would.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
well,
i'm
taking
fundamentally
the
position
that
i
win
on
either
one.
i
win
on
the
imminent
and
substantial
and
i
also
win
on
what
the
scope
of
relief
is
that
is
afforded--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
with
all
those
assumptions,
the
argument
is
that
that
is
the
way
this
statute
is
structured.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
well,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
breyer,
the
wording
of
the
statute
is
"order
such
person
to
take
such
other
action
as
may
be
necessary--
"
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--fundamentally
because
our
argument
is
that
that
is
not
what
congress
intended.
congress
intended
to--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--why?
because
in
the
broader
scheme
of
things,
the
citizen
suit
remedy
in
this
statute,
as
in
its
predecessors,
is
designed
to
afford
limited
relief
to
plaintiffs
and
not
to
have
plaintiffs
coming
in
with
all
sorts
of
money
damages
claims--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--i'm
arguing
for
the
proposition
never
under
this
statute.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
that
is
true.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
that
is
part
of
the
argument
and
that
is
what
the
statute
provides,
and
that's
fundamentally--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--well,
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
contempt.
and
i'm
glad
you
raised
that,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
was
contemplating
that
when
justice
souter
asked
a
similar
question
earlier.
but,
again,
a
statute...
this
particular
statute
provides
a
limited
array
of
remedies,
and
while
in
the
situation
you've
described
if
the
contumacious
defendant
does
not
clean
up,
there
may
be
a
remedy
available
under
sanctions
principles
and
that
may
get
the
plaintiff
to
the
same
point
he
would
otherwise
be,
but--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--there
are
those
cases.
those
cases
have
been
cited
by
respondent.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
the
court
does
retain
equitable
power,
and
the
limits
on
that
equitable
power
are
circumscribed
by
the
particular
statute
at
issue.
and
fundamentally
where
we
part
company
with
respondents
in
the
line
of
cases
that
starts
from
porter
and
traces
its
way
through
franklin
v.
wynnette
is
that
we
are
faced
with
a
much
different
statute
than
was
at
issue
either
in
porter
or--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--well,
again,
since
the
phrase
is
actually
"order
such
person
to
take
such
other
action.
"
the
phrase
seems
to
be
even
more
limited
than
the
part
that
you're
quoting,
justice
kennedy,
in
all
due
respect.
and
it
seems
to
aim
more
at
requiring
somebody
to
undertake
acts
as
opposed
to
requiring
a
payment
of
some
sort.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
it
can
be
read
that
way.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
well,
my
reading
is
that
the
statute
has
a
limited--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--the
way
i
read
the
statute...
and
i
was
taking
justice
scalia's
comments
in
the
context
of
justice
kennedy's
question,
but
fundamentally
the
way
i
read
the
statute
is
the
statute
says
that
you
can
address
an
imminent
harm.
you
can
take
steps
to
prevent
future
harms,
and
that
is
what
is
afforded--
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
--yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
i'm
about
to.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
i
think
the
court
does
because
you're
starting
from
a
point
where
the
court
exercises
its
jurisdiction
initially
consistent
with
the
statute.
and
another
way
to
look
at
it
is
that
the
court
is
simply
following
up
on
something
that
initiated
under
the
jurisdiction
that
was
given
it...
given
to
it
originally.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
not
necessarily
because
where
i...
the
way
i
get
to
the
ability
to
award
damages
in
the
hypothetical
posed
first
by
justice
souter
and
then
by
justice
kennedy
is
the
jurisdiction
is
invoked
initially
pursuant
to
the
statute
to
remedy
a
future
harm
or
an
imminent
endangerment.
and
then
damages
are
awarded
in
furtherance
of
that.
the
jurisdiction
has
already
been
exercised.
so,
the
example
you're
giving,
justice
breyer,
is
a
lot
broader
and
does
enter
into
some
line
drawing
problems.
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
i
have
three
very
brief
answers
to
that.
number
one,
we
as
parties
litigating
and
the
court
are
limited
by
what
congress
has
provided,
number
one,
and
the
scheme
that
congress
has
provided
provides
a
90-day
notice
provision
and
then
by
implication
in
some
situations
would
require
a
plaintiff
to
wait.
secondly,
the...
by
giving
notice,
there
is
some
likelihood
that
particularly
with
a
serious
endangerment,
that
the
epa
or
the
state
or
the
alleged
contaminator
are
going
to
come
in
and
do
some
action.
so,
the
argument
advanced
by
respondents
that
we
are
going
to
have
hazardous
waste
sites
that
are
continuing
to
damage
the
environment
and
damage
human
health
isn't
necessarily
so.
and
thirdly,
within
the
statute
itself...
and
the
statute
is
contained
in
the
appendix
to
respondent's
brief...
there
is
a
provision
and
it's
within
the
notice
provision.
the
notice
says
90
days
to
the
epa,
to
the
state,
and
to
the
contaminator.
there
is
a
provision
that
says,
except
where
there
is
an
allegation
of
a
violation
of
subchapter
3
of
the
statute,
and
subchapter
3
is
the
portion
of
the
statute
that
deals
with
hazardous
waste.
so,
presumably
in
a
situation
where
you
have
hazardous
waste,
the
plaintiff
need
not
wait
the
90
days
if
it
is
going
in
to
remedy
a
hazardous
waste
situation.
so,
those
are
my
three
responses
to
that
argument.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
time
on
the
remainder?
mr.
john
p.
zaimes
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'll
cover
only
three
points
in
that
2-minute
time,
if
i
may.
first,
i
had
begun
to
discuss
the
cases,
the
line
of
cases,
cited
by
respondent
beginning
with
porter
v.
warner
holding
and
ending
up
more
recently
in
franklin
v.
wynnette
county.
those
cases
are
cited
for
the
proposition
that
there
was
a
broad
equitable
power
in
federal
courts
that
can
be
called
on
in
this
situation.
and
if
we
look
at
porter
as
the
beginning
of
that
line,
porter
was
a
case
in
which
the
words
of
the
statute
were
much
different
from
those
here.
porter
had
a
statute
that
allowed
the
court
to
issue
an
injunction
or
other
order,
significantly
broader
than
what
we
have
here.
and
the
court
in
that
case
looked
at
the
legislative
history
and
determined
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute,
the
emergency
price
control
act,
was
consistent
with
a
reading
that
allowed
the
court,
the
lower
court,
to
order
the
apartment
owner
to
reimburse
monies
collected
over
the
limit
set
by
the
emergency
price
act.
in
the
franklin
case,
there
was
no
congressional
guidance
on
the
limitations
of
remedies
under
that
statute.
franklin
arose
under
title
9
and
the
right
of
action
had
been
found
to
be
an
implied
right
of
action
under
cannon
v.
city...
university
of
chicago.
so,
what
the
court
determined
was
that
there
were
four
remedies
available
where
congress
has
not
spoken
as
to
the
nature
of
the
remedies.
since
congress
hadn't
even
expressly
indicated
the
right
of
action,
they
hadn't
indicated
the
remedies
either.
here
we
have
an
abundance
of
guidance.
we
have
the
language
of
the
statute.
we
have
legislative
history
of
this
and
predecessor
statutes
and
even
of
the
cercla
amendments
in
1986,
all
of
which
point
to
a
very
limited
reading...
limited
availability
of
remedies
under
this
citizen
supervision.
and
we
have
a
comparable
statute,
rcra,
which,
as
justice
ginsburg
notes,
has
a
full
discussion
of
the
kinds
of
limitations
that
are
placed
on
plaintiffs
seeking
to
recover
their
costs.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
with
