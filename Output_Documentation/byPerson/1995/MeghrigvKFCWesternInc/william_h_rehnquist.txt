next
in
no.
95-83,
alan
meghrig
v.
kfc
western,
inc.--
mr.
zaimes,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
mr.
zaimes.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
again
is
your
reference
there,
mr.
minear?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
section?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
isn't
a
broad
grant
of
equitable
jurisdiction.
it's
a
much
more
circumscribed
grant
of
part
of
a
court
of
equity's
powers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
the
language
to
"restrain
any
person",
et
cetera
and
then
to
"order
such
person
to
take
such
a.
"
is
the
sum
and
substance
of
the...
what
would
be
granted
if
the
courts...
if
the
statute
said
the
court
shall
have
equitable
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
romano,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
nothing
implied
about
the
cause
of
action
here,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
person
may
commence
a
civil
action
on
his
own
behalf.
it's
just
a
question
of
what
he...
when
he
can
do
it
and
what
he
can
get
as
a
result
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
your
position,
mr.
romano,
with
respect
to
a
situation
where
a
property
owner
discovers
the
hazard,
goes
ahead
and
cleans
it
up
so
that
there's
no
longer
any
imminent
or
substantial
endangerment,
and
then
goes
to
court?
what
can
he
recover
in
the
way
of
a
monetary
award?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
then
he
doesn't
have
to
present
an
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
to
health.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's...
but
in
2,
which
is
what
says
what
the
court
can
do,
it
refers
to
the
endangerment.
surely
that's
referring
back
to
an
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
may
be
a
good
argument,
as
one
of
my
colleagues
said,
for
a
different
statute,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
statute
does
require
an
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
at
the
time
you
bring
the
lawsuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
(a)(1)(b)'s
list
of
potential
defendants
like
a
present
generator
or
something,
that
those
are
just
kind
of
illustrative
and
you
could
bring
an
action
against
lots
of
other
people
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
romano.
mr.
zaimes,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zaimes.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-83,
meghrig
versus
kfc
western,
inc.
will
be
announced
be
announce
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
