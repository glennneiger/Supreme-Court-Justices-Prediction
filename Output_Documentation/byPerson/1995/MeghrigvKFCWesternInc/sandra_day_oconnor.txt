justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
zaimes,
there
are
two
potential
questions
that
i
guess
we
might
resolve,
and
i'm
not
sure
if
we
have
to
resolve
them
both
or
not.
one
has
to
do
with
the
statutory
requirement
that
an
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
be
alleged.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
may
possibly
be
decisive
for
our
purposes
of
this
case.
the
other
has
to
do
with
what's
recoverable,
assuming
there
is
a
valid
claim
made,
and
the
extent
of
a
court's
equitable
authority.
what
does
that
cover?
are
you
going
to
address
both
those
issues?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
we
need
to
decide
both
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
question
on
which
there
is
a
split
of
authority.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
had
a
case
where
there
is
an
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
alleged
and
the
plaintiff
says,
i
want
an
injunction
and
i
want
an
order
that
the
defendant
will
pay
the
costs
of
future
cleanup?
is
that
within
the
court's
equitable
power?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
either
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
aren't
there
cases
holding
that
courts
retain
equitable
authority
not
specifically
taken
away
by
congress?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and
you
recognized
the
validity
of
that
notion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
opinion
doesn't
read
that
way,
mr.
minear.
i
think
that's
quite
unlikely.
i
think
maybe
we
ought
to
wade
into
it
and
find
out
what
it
is
that
the
court
can
do
in
the
way
of
damages.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
argue
that
the
statute
authorizes
the
court
to
award
past
cleanup
costs
as
a
remedy
or
that
it
just
doesn't
prohibit
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
actual
money
damages
for
past
cleanup
costs
fits
within
that
statutory
description?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1988,
the
respondent,
kfc
western
was
ordered
by
the
county
of
los
angeles
to
remove
and
dispose
of
some
petroleum
contaminated
soil
from
the
property
surrounding
a
kentucky
fried
chicken
restaurant
in
los
angeles.
three
years
after,
the
clean-up
effort
was
completed
by
kfc.
kfc
brought
suit
in
federal
court
under
the
citizen
suit
probation
of
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
the
acronym
fo
rthat
is
rcra.
it
sought,
to
recover
the
cost
of
its
clean-up
effort
from
two
previous
owners
of
the
property,
mr.
and
mrs.
meghrig.
now
rcra
provides
that
a
private
party
like
kfc
may
bring
suit
for
the
clean-up
of
hazardous
or
solid
waste,
the
act
says,
“which
may
present
an
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
to
health
or
the
environment”
and
rcra
allows
a
party
suing
under
the
provision
to
seek
two
statutory
remedies.
it
authorizes
the
district
court
to
restrain
any
person
who
might
have
contributed
to
a
toxic
waste
problem
or
to
order
such
person
to
take
such
other
action
as
may
be
necessary.
the
district
court
dismissed
kfc's
suit
under
these
provisions.
the
district
court
concluded
that
kfc
was
not
suing
for
the
remediation
of
any
toxic
waste
that
may
present
an
imminent
danger
because
kfc
had
already
removed
the
petroleum
waste
long
before
filing
suit.
the
district
court
also
held
that
the
suit
was
infirm
because
the
only
relief
that
kfc
sought
was
the
restitution
of
past
clean-up
cost
which
remedy,
the
district
court
thought,
was
not
authorized
under
rcra.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
on
both
grounds.
it
held
that
a
private
party
can
file
a
citizen
suit
under
rcra
so
long
as
it
alleges
that
the
waste
in
question
did
at
one
time
present
an
imminent
danger
to
health
or
the
environment,
and
the
court
found
that
rcra
authorizes
the
award
of
past
clean-up
cost
as
a
form
of
equitable
restitution.
in
the
opinion
of
filed
today,
we
reverse.
based
on
our
review
of
the
language
of
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
act
along
with
the
comparison
between
rcra
act
and
other
citizen
suit
provisions
in
other
environmental
acts
passed
by
congress,
we
conclude
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
this
act
to
authorize
the
kind
of
action
which
kfc
brought
here.
the
rcra
citizens
suit
provision
was
designed
to
allow
private
parties
to
sue
for
the
abatement
of
hazardous
and
solid
waste
site
that
pose
some
imminent
danger
to
the
health
or
the
environment.
it
was
not
designed
for
private
citizens
who
have
already
undertaken
the
clean-up
to
later
seek
reimbursement
for
their
efforts
from
other
responsible
parties.
and
the
opinion
for
the
court
is
unanimous.
