was
the
cleanup
done
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
municipality?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
had
a
building
permit
been
conditioned
on
the
cleanup?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
respondent
was
under
really
a
legal
duty
to
clean
up
the
property,
at
least
if
the
building
permit
were
going
to
be
granted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
that
the
court
ordered
the
previous
owner
to
clean
up
under
this
statute
with
proper
notice
and
the
owner
is
contumacious.
he
does
not
obey
the
court's
order.
and
the
plaintiff
then,
giving
due
notice
again
of
his
intent,
undertakes
to
clean
up
the...
and
stop
the
waste
himself.
as
an
ordinary
measure
of
contempt
of
court
sanctions,
is
not
the
plaintiff
entitled
to
recover
the
cost
that
he
expended
to
avoid
the
harm
that
the
defendant,
in
contempt
of
the
court's
order,
refused
to
undertake
on
his
own?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
my
hypothetical
case,
you
cannot
get
the
power
of
the
court
to
order
that
limited
measure
of
damages
from
the
phrase
"take
such
other
action
as
may
be
necessary?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure.
he
can
tell
us
later,
because
he's
reserved
time,
what
he
conceded
and
what
he
didn't.
i
think
you
should
address
the
argument
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
permits
the
award
of
what
in
essence
are
monetary
damages.
the
government
cites
rent
control
cases
where
there
was
restitution,
the
moore
case
and
i
think
the
porter
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
were
decided
well
before
our
opinion
in
cort
v.
ash.
