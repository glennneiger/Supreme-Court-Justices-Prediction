mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
initial
and
controlling
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
citizen
plaintiff
may
seek
relief
under
section
7002(a)(1)(b)
of
rcra
if
there
is
no
current
endangerment
at
the
time
of
suit.
we
think
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
section
7002(a)(1)(b)
provides
that
for
judicial
relief
in
response
to
specific
activities,
namely,
the
treatment,
storage,
and
disposal
of
waste,
that,
quote,
may
present
an
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment,
end
quote.
the
statute's
use
of
the
term
"may
present"
indicates
there
must
be
a
current
endangerment
at
the
time
the
suit
is
filed.
that
construction
is
born
out
by
section
7002(b)(2)(a),
the
so-called
notice
provision,
which
requires
the
plaintiff
to
provide
notice
to
the
defendant
and
also
to
the
other
government
agencies
of
the
endangerment
before
filing
suit.
respondent
attempts
to
avoid
that
construction
by
arguing
that
the
limiting
clause
requiring
endangerment
actually
refers
to
a
description
of
the
hazardous
waste
and
not
to
the
antecedent
activities.
the
statute,
however,
will
not
afford
that
construction.
section
7002(b)(2)(b),
which
appears
at
the
bottom
of
appendix
page
3
of
respondent's
red
brief,
states
that
a
citizen
suit
is
precluded
if
the
epa
is
taking
action
in
response
to,
quote,
activities
that
may
present
the
alleged
endangerment.
for
that
reason,
it
is
clear
that
congress
was
referring
to
the
activities
and
not
the
waste
when
using
the
term
"endangerment".
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
at
appendix
page
3
of
the
red
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
is
7002(b)(2)(b).
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this...
the
construction
that
we
urge
here
is
not
only
consistent
with
the
statutory
terms,
but
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
overall
design
of
the
statute
which
is
structured
to
abate
existing
hazards.
for
example,
the
statute
makes
reference
to
prospective
remedies.
it
also
provides
a
notice
provision,
as
i
discussed
before,
which
provides
for
the
elimination
of
the
hazard
and
the
avoidance
of
the
suit.
it
also
contains
no
statute
of
limitations
respecting
any
damage
claims
that
would
thereby
prevent
any
stale
damage
claims.
in
addition,
the
legislative
history
supports
the
construction
that
we
urge.
for
example,
house
report
198
describes
the
section
7002(a)(1)(b)
remedy
as
a
limited
abatement
remedy.
if
you
agree
with
us
that
the...
a
citizen
must
show
a
imminent
and
substantial
endangerment
at
the
time
of
suit,
then
the
court
need
go
no
further
in
this
case.
the
respondent
did
not
show
a
current
endangerment,
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
should
be
reversed
on
that
basis
alone.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first,
i
think
it's
important
for
this
court
to
recognize
that
the
preconditions
for
suit
must
be
satisfied
before
we
get
to
the
issues
of
remedy.
now,
obviously,
they
are
related,
but
i
think
it
is...
it
puts
the
court
in
a
difficult
position
to
address
the
question
of
remedies
where
no
such
remedy
could
be
afforded
in
this
particular
case.
second,
if
you
do
resolve
the
case
on
the
first
issue,
i
think
that
might
well
cause
the
court
of
appeals
to
reconsider
its
reasoning
with
regard
to
the
second
issue,
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
circuit
conflict
that
currently
exists
will
dissipate
as
a
result
of
your
ruling
on
the
first
issue.
in
any
event,
i
think
that
it
is
important
for
the
court--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
doesn't
expressly
address
the
issue,
but
it
does
provide...
allow
the
court
to
allow
relief
that
is
necessary.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
in
certain
circumstances
a
monetary
remedy
can
be
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
here
is
to
allow
the
courts
to
compel
a
responsible
party
that
has
created
a
current
endangerment
to
abate
that
endangerment,
and
it
will
be
in
some
circumstances
necessary
to
apply
a
restitutionary
type
remedy
to
ensure
that
that
purpose
is
fulfilled.
for
example,
suppose
that
the...
a
plaintiff
brings
a
suit
and
during
the
notice
period
asks
the
defendant
to
clean
up
the
site.
the
defendant
will
have
a
powerful
incentive
not
to
take
any
action
to
clean
up
the
site
and
to
try
to
force
the
endangered
community
to
assume
those
costs
if
it
knows
that
the
court
will
be
unable
to
award
any
damages
in
those
circumstances.
i
do
not
believe
that's
what
congress
had
intended
in
this
situation.
moreover,
the
position
that
we
take
is
consistent
with
the
general
view
this
court
has
expressed
with
regard
to
a
court's
equitable
powers.
this
court
has
noted
in
various
circumstances
that
a
court
may
include
a
restitutionary
remedy
together
with
other
equitable
relief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
think
that
the
primary
circumspection
or
limitation
on
the
court's
power
is
really
the
requirement
of
the
current
endangerment.
once
there
is
a
current
endangerment,
then
it
becomes...
it
behooves
the
court
to
take
those
steps
that
are
necessary
to
abate
the
endangerment
and
also
to
assure
that
the
responsible--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
we
think
it
is.
we
think
that
it
gives
the
same
general
grant
of
power
with
regard
to
any
order
that
may
be
necessary.
equity...
equitable
principles
are
circumscribed
by
the
requirement
of
necessity,
that
the
court's
power
must...
the
court
must
step
in
to
prevent
an
injustice
in
a
particular
case.
and
we
do
think
that
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
mr.
zaimes
has
made
that
concession,
then
we
are
in
substantial
agreement
on
that
point.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
our
view
that
all
of
them
may
be
reimbursable,
but
there
are
several
other
conditions
that
we
would
recognize.
first
of
all,
they
have
to
be
expenses
that
were
reasonably
necessary
to
abate
the
danger
that
was
presented
by
the
hazard
that
was
proposed.
there
also
had
to
be
notice
to
the
defendant
with
regard
to
these
expenses
and
a
decision
by
the
defendant
not
to
take...
undertake
them.
and
the
reason
why
these
expenses
are
assessable
is
because
they
are
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
statute
works
the
way
that
congress
intended,
namely,
that
it
would
encourage
the
responsible
party
to
clean
up
the
site
and
eliminate
the
need
for
a
suit.
if
the
party
refuses
to
do
so,
then
it
faces
the
additional
costs
that
will
be
associated
with
reimbursing
the
plaintiff,
in
addition
to
the
equitable
order
that
might
require
the
defendant
to
complete
the
cleanup
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
congress
does
not
simply
see...
wishing
to
see
that
the
sites
be
cleaned
up.
they're
also
interested
in
seeing
that
the
responsible
parties
would
bear
those
expenses.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
may
i
answer
that
question?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
draw
a
different
distinction
with
regard
to
that
line
that
congress
drew,
and
that
is
that
it
was
concerned
with
directing
the
court's
resources
to
imminent
hazards,
those
that
required
immediate
abatement.
and
once
you
cross
that
threshold,
the
court
has
its
full
equitable
power.
thank
you.
