how
could
it
be
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
supervening
cause
doctrine?
suppose
that
the
ship
had
been
floating
around
because
of
the
negligence
of
the
defendant,
and
it
ran
into
a
leftover
world
war
ii
submarine
that
torpedoed
it?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
suppose
the
most
fantastic
coincidence,
struck
by
lightning,
suppose
that...
i
mean,
we
can
imagine
any
bizarre
set
of
circumstance
we
want.
that
would
cut
the
causal
chain,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
what
has
comparative
negligence
to
do
with
that,
some
amazing
coincidence,
some
odd
circumstance
that
cuts
the
causal
chain
and
in
and
of
itself
is
the
cause
of
the
accident,
the
original
negligence
being
simply
a
but-for
condition
that
happened
to
place
the
ship
in
the
particular
part
of
the
sea
where
the
enemy
submarine
was
lurking,
or
the
lightning
struck?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
so,
how--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
then
the
judge
says
zero
portion,
because
there
was
a
supervening
cause,
just
like
the
submarine
which
would
have
torpedoed
the
ship
or
the
submarine
that
would
have
led
to
evasive
action
and
an
eventual
stranding
of
the
ship.
in
this
case
the
ship
had
come
to
rest,
it
was
safe,
there
was
no
problem,
and
it
was
the
captain,
himself,
who
then
caused
the
trouble
because
of
the
captain's
failure
to
keep
any
chart,
because
of
his
failure
to
let
the
anchor
down,
because
of
his
properly...
because
of
failure,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
and
he's
listed
about
five.
i
mean,
once
you
say
there
could
be
some
supervening
cause,
then
how
do
you
distinguish
your
case
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is...
i
mean,
not
any
stranding.
presumably
not
a
stranding
caused
by
evasive
action
against
the
submarine.
not
any
stranding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
a
stranding
15
years
later
in
some
foreign
place,
so
why
is
it
that
this
stranding
is
within
the
contemplation,
given
the
enormously
negligent,
grossly
negligent,
or
however
we
call
it,
activity
of
the
captain.
i
mean,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
boil
down
to
the
same
question
as
the
other.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ms.
hufstedler,
if
we
accepted
your
rationale,
which
i
guess
is
the
ultimate
admiralty
policy
should
be
to
place
the
responsibility
where...
damage
responsibility
on
the
party
with
the
best
chance
of
avoiding
the
harm,
i
suppose
we
wouldn't
even
have
a
comparative
fault
rule
at
all.
we'd
simply
decide
which
of
the
parties
was
in
the
best
position
to
avoid
the
harm
and
we
would
attribute
all
of
the
damage
to
that
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
true,
i
don't
know...
i
didn't
notice
this
in
the
brief
particularly,
but
is
it
true
in
the
case
of
a
corporate
defendant
where
there
are
many
different
individuals
involved
and
they're
all
the
plaintiffs,
sorry,
corporate
plaintiff,
the
third
person
in
the
restatement
was
not
meant
to
refer
to
employees
of
the
same
plaintiff?
do
you
know
that?
i
mean,
i
don't
know.
the
answer
to
me
is
not
obvious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
did
notice
now
that,
since
it's
pointed
out--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
it
does
say
third
person,
and
i
don't
know
how
that
was
meant
to
apply
in
the...
nobody
seems
to
argue
that
at
length.
maybe
they
did,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
we
know
how
that
word,
third
person,
was
meant
by
the
restatement
drafters
to
apply--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
case
of
the
corporate
plaintiff
with
many
employees?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
what
i'm
actually
thinking
is
that
if
the
employee,
if
the
plaintiff
company
happens
also
to
employ
my
submarine
captain,
it
would
make
no
sense
not
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
supervening
cause,
but
if
the
employee
happens
to
be
the
person
who
himself,
let's
say,
was
physically
injured
in
a
tort
case,
then
it
would
seem
more
likely
and
reasonable
to
apply
the
comparative
negligence.
at
least
that's
an
initial
reaction.
i
haven't
thought
it
through,
and
that's
why
i'm
puzzled
as
to
how
this
third
party
doctrine
does
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it...
i
just
noticed
out
of
interest
that
in
one
of
your...
the
red
briefs
they've
cited
cases
from
scotland,
australia,
canada,
england,
and
i
guess
a
number
of
other
places.
in
any
of
those
other
places
in
the
world
have
they
shed
light
on
either
the
third
party
doctrine,
the
third
party
part
or
the
supervening
cause
part?
were
those
cases
actually--
