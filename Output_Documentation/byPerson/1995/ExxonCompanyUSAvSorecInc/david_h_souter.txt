justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
hufstedler,
as
i
understand
the
district
court's
findings,
the
findings
were
that,
at
a
certain
point,
i
think
about
90
minutes
after
the
difficulties
began,
the
tanker
reached
a
point
of
safety.
it
was...
according
to
the
district
court
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
out
of
whatever
danger
had
been
created
by
the
negligent
acts
of
the
defendants,
and
the
finding
was
from
that
point
on
the
causation
for
the
ultimate
grounding
and
the
harm
that
resulted
was
entirely
attributable
to
the
navigational
errors,
errors
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
tanker's
captain.
do
you
claim
that
there
is
an
error
of
law
in
what
i
understand
to
be
the
finding
that
the
tanker
had
reached
this
zone
of
safety
after
which
the
prior
negligence
of
the
defendant
simply
was
not
operative?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
asking
just
a
question
of...
well
i
asked
whether
there
was
an
error
of
law.
i'm
really
asking,
i
guess,
whether
you
claim
that
there
is
such
a
want
of
evidentiary
basis
for
the
finding
about
reaching
the
zone
of
safety
that
it
was,
in
fact,
a
legal
error
to
conclude
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
how
do
we
know
whether
you're
right
or
wrong?
tell
me
what
your
basis
is
for
saying
that
there
was
no
evidentiary
basis
to
reach
that
conclusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
i
know
the
train
you're
following,
but
i
take
it,
then,
in
order
to
rule
your
way
we
would
have
to
find
that
the...
i
guess
the
second
of
the
conclusions
of
law
is
simply
unsupportable,
and
that's
the
conclusion
that
such
conduct...
that
is,
of
your
captain...
was
a
superseding
cause,
and
the
sole
proximate
cause
of
the
stranding.
we
would
have
to
reject
particularly
that
finding
that
it
was
the
sole
proximate
cause,
wouldn't
we,
in
order
to
hold
your
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
you
could
simply
assume
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
say,
on
that
assumption,
nonetheless,
superseding
cause.
well,
on
any
factual
question,
ms....
we
have
a
two-court
rule
which
we
usually
follow.
the
district
court
found
against
you
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
so
that
anything
that
is
a
factual
question
i
don't
think
we
ordinarily
reexamine.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
when
you
use
superseding
cause
here,
and
you
say
it
should
not
be
recognized,
are
you
talking
about
superseding
cause
as
a
cause
attributed
to
the
plaintiff,
as
distinct
from
the
third
party?
we
have
a
terminological
problem--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
442,
which
you
quote,
says
superseding
cause
by
definition
is
only
that
which
is
set
in
play
by
a
third
party
or
a
third
force,
and
i
take
it
we
don't
have
that
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
are
we
just
talking,
then,
about
labels,
because
let's
assume
we
say,
superseding
cause
is
a
third
party
or
a
third
force
phenomenon.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't
have
that
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
however,
it
is
findable
in
any
comparative
negligence
case,
i
suppose,
that
a
point
is
reached
at
which
the
defendant's
original
causation
should
no
longer
be
recognized
by
the
law,
because
it
has
become
attenuated
and
so
on,
and
in
place
of
it
the
plaintiff's
negligence
is
so
overwhelmingly
the
cause
that
we
should
recognize
that
as
proximate
cause
only.
now,
i
take
it
you
do
not
claim
that
that
kind
of
analysis
is
somehow
precluded
by
the
comparative
negligence
doctrine.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
let's
assume
there's
no
third
person,
as,
indeed--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
true
here,
no
third
party.
isn't
it
true,
consistently
with
comparative
negligence,
that
if
the
facts
warranted
a
court
or
jury
could
conclude
that
the
defendant's
cause
was
no
longer
proximate,
although
the
defendant
had,
in
a
but-for
sense,
set
things
in
motion,
and
that
the
only
proximate
cause
operative
at
the
time
of
injury
was
the
cause
that
the
plaintiff
had
set
in
motion?
that
is
consistent
with
comparative
negligence.
it
has
to
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
other
words,
if
the
defendant
had
foreseen
that
the
plaintiff
was
going
to
do
all
the
stupid
things
that
he
says
he
later
did,
then
that
is
still
within
the
risk--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
you
would
still
leave
the
defendant
in
there.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
a
third
party
intervention,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
i
think
justice
o'connor
and
i
are
both
bothered
by
a
question
of
terminology.
under
442
there's
got
to
be
a
third
party
or
a
third
force.
it's
not
plaintiff's
negligence,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
just
read
from
442(b).
i
mean,
it's
saying
that
the
defendant
doesn't
get
off
the
hook.
i'm
reading
from
page...
where
it's
set
out
on
page
30
of
the
blue
brief.
except
where
the
harm
is
intentionally
caused
by
a
third
person
and
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
risk
created
by
the
actor's
conduct.
i
mean,
isn't
that
pretty
clearly
a
third
person
rule?
the
text
writers,
some
of
them
at
least,
use
it...
use
superseding
to
refer
to
plaintiff's
conduct,
but
442
talks
about
a
third
party,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
if
we're
going
to
take
the
restatement
view,
we're
going
to
look
for
a
third
party
and
we
don't
have
one
here,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the
captain
was
working
for
exxon.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
maybe
he
was
just
engaging
in
a
terminological
mistake.
he
wasn't
saying
that
the
captain
had
ceased
to
be
the
agent
of
the
ship
and
had
somehow
gone
beyond
the
scope
of
his
employment.
he
was
simply
doing
his
job
in
a
grossly
negligent
fashion,
and
in
normal
terminology,
that
still
makes
him
identical
with
exxon
for
this
purpose,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
well,
isn't
proximate
cause
a
mixed
question?
i
mean,
it
involves
the
application
of
facts
as
found
to
a
concept
of
limited
causation,
which
is
a
legal
concept.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
mixed.
