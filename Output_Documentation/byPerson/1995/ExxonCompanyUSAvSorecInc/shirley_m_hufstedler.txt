ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
exxon's
tanker
would
never
have
stranded
but
for
respondent's
torts
and
breaches
of
warranty.
the
question
presented
is
whether
these
respondents
should
be
totally
absolved
of
all
liability
because
the
district
court
found
that
the
tanker
captain's
navigation
of
the
stricken
vessel
was
grossly
negligent.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
the
lower
courts
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
by
failing
to
apply
the
comparative
fault
principles
established
by
this
court
in
reliable
transfer
and
its
progeny
by
misconceiving
and
misapplying
the
common-law
doctrine
of
superseding
cause.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
not
suffices
but,
but
for
that
issue,
you'd
never
reach
the
question
whether
there's
any
superseding
cause,
because
superseding
cause,
if
it
applies
at
all
in
admiralty
since
reliable
transfer,
necessarily
assumes,
as
the
district
court
concluded,
that
there
had
been
actual
cause,
or
you'd
never
reach
superseding
cause.
you
don't
reach
superseding
cause,
which
is
a
limitation
of
liability,
and
it's
not
causation
at
all.
it's
a
question
of
fault.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
of
course.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
in
admiralty,
as
in
common
law,
you
have
to
have
but-for
causation
and
legal
cause.
i
do
not
suggest
for
a
moment
that
an
admiralty
claimant
need
not
prove
both.
the
difficulty
here
is
that
the
foreclosure
orders
of
the
district
court
prevented
exxon
from
ever
proving
its
liability
case-in-chief
to
prove
that
there
was
legal
cause
as
well
as
but-for
cause,
and
you
never
got
to
the
issue
of
damages
because
you
never
finished
proving
liability.
all
of
exxon's
evidence
with
respect
to
everything
that
happened
before
the
equipment
failed
was
foreclosed
by
the
district
court.
it
wasn't
a
question
of
order
of
proof.
it
was
the
question
of
entering
judgment
before
the
liability
case-in-chief
was
proved.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
yes,
because
the
captain
was
reacting
to
a
series
of
hazards
that
were
created
prior
to
the
time
the
equipment
failed.
exxon
was
foreclosed
from
proving
anything
that
happened
before
that,
and
even
under
common-law
doctrine,
no
one
can
prove
there
is
a
superseding
cause
or
that
there
is
not
unless
there
is
first
proved
what
the
duties
are
with
respect
to
each
of
the
defendant's
acts
on
the
basis
of
their
relationship
with
each
other,
and
how
those
breaches
of
duties
created
the
risks
of
harm,
and
until
those
facts
are
proved,
there
is
no
way
in
which
a
court
can
decide
whether
there
has
been
superseding
cause.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
oh,
of
course
not.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
sure.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
that's
correct.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
justice
souter,
the
response
is
that
the
court's
conclusions
of
law
cannot
be
reconciled
with
its
other
findings
of
fact.
the
other
findings--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--yes.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
i
say
there's
no
evidentiary
basis
because
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court
on
uncontradicted
evidence
was
that
the
trailing
hose
caused
the
crane
to
collapse
after
the
point
at
which
the
vessel
was
supposed
to
be
safe,
that
the
hose
and
the
collapse
of
the
crane
caused
the
boom
of
the
crane
to
sweep
the
decks,
which
threatened
the
vessel's
life
by
explosion
and
threatened
the
lives
of
all
the
deck
crew.
that
was
a
direct
result
of
the
breaking
of
the
chafe
chain,
of
the
breakage
of
the
hose,
of
the
lack
of
any
safety
equipment
on
the
cargo
hose,
of
the
lack
of
any
safety
equipment--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--yes,
and
i
think
the
court,
unless
it
is
going
to
retreat
from
decisions
long
embedded
in
the
law,
would
have
to
say
that
that's
incorrect,
because
you
cannot
decide,
even
under
common
law,
whether
there
has
been
a
superseding
cause
unless
you
have
had
an
opportunity
to
know
whether
or
not
what
actually
happened
was
within
the
risks
that
were
caused
by
the
breaches
of--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--yes,
you--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--i
don't
suggest
you
reexamine
it,
your
honor.
what
i
suggest
is
that
you
look
at
the
basis
of
the
doctrine
of
superseding
cause
and,
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
cannot
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
superseding
cause
unless
you
have
evidence
that
shows
what
the
duties
were
that
were
breached.
that's
a
question
of
law.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
you
only
reach
the
question
you
have
suggested
i
presented
if
you
get
past
the
first
point.
i
believe
that
the
eleventh
circuit
is
entirely
right,
that
after
reliable
transfer,
that
the
superseding
cause
doctrine
as
it
was
applied
sometimes
in
admiralty
cases
below,
is
no
longer
applicable.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
i
am
unaware
of
any.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
but
justice
breyer--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--justice
breyer,
surely
the
admiralty
defendant
would
not
be
responsible
for
whatever
the
results
were
in
your
illustration--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--however,
there
is
no
reason
why
the
admiralty
defendant
that
has
breached
a
duty
and
created
a
risk
of
some
kind
of
harm
should
not
be
responsible
for
whatever
portion
of
that
damage
was
attributable
to
the
acts
before.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
well,
as
i
read
your
own
authorities,
both
with...
and
we're
now
talking
only
about
the
tort
claims.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
breach
of
the
warranty
claims,
but
talking
only
about
the
tort
claims...
there
must
be...
before
one
can
say
that
a
cause
has
superseded,
one
must
examine
what
the
hazards
were
that
were
created
in
the
first
place,
as
restatement
black
letter
442
states,
that
the
cause
is
always
proximate
if
what
happened
was
within
the
risk
that
was
created
by
the
original
misconduct
and
if
there
was
a...
or
was
also
a
contributing
factor
to
that.
the
only
time
you
get
a
cause
broken
is
in
the
illustrations
that
you
just
gave,
where
there
is
conduct
of
a
third
person
that
is
either
criminal
or
intentionally
tortious.
then
the
chain
of
causation
is
broken.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
yes.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
that's
why
the
doctrine
doesn't
apply
at
all,
even
if
you
assume
that
common-law
superseding
cause
survived
the
adoption
of
the--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--yes.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
that's
right.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
it
is
not
that
it
can
never
happen
where
there
has
been
a
third
person
that
has
intervened.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
yes.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
it
is
consistent
with
comparative
negligence
if--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--you
assume
that...
and
i
believe
the
close
question
does
assume...
that
the
risk
that
was
run
by
the
wrongful
conduct
did
not
encompass
what
happened.
here--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--i...
to
put--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--to
put
it
differently,
the
risk
that
was
run
was
the
risk
of
stranding.
it
is
not
material,
applying
standard
tort
law
that
the
risk
came
up...
that
what
happened
came
about
in
a
way
that--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--i
would
say
no,
because
stranding,
no
matter
how
it's
stranded,
was
within
the
exact
risks
that
were
created
by
the
respondent's
torts.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
there...
what
i'm...
i
guess
i
have
to
say
that
while
it's
possible
to
take
the
view
that
superseding
cause,
criminal
superseding
cause
survived
comparative
fault,
nevertheless,
it
should
not
be
applied
in
admiralty
when
to
apply
it
violates
the
admiralty
policies
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
are
going
to
dominate
what
kind
of
law
is
going
to
be
applied,
and
the
admiralty
policies
are
to
place
the
risk
of
loss
on
those
persons
who
are
in
the
best
situation
to
prevent--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--it
is
with
respect
to...
it
is
with
respect
to
the
negligence
charge.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
breach
of
warranty
charges
because,
of
course,
superseding
cause
does
not
apply
to
breaches
of
warranty
which
are
sounding
in
contract,
not
tort.
the
so-called
superseding
cause
doctrine
is
not
relevant.
what
you're
talking
about
then
is
the
ability
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
breaches
of
warranty,
and
that
is
an
issue
that
goes
to
damages,
not
to
liability.
there
is
no
issue
that
i
have
discovered
that
has
suggested
otherwise,
and
this
court's
decision
in
italia
societa
and
weyerhaeuser
is
quite
clear
that
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
does
not
present
recovery
and/or
breach
of
an
admiralty
warranty.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
the
question
is,
is
the
concept
which
is
built
on
legal
policy
of
superseding
cause
one
that
should
be
applied
to
a
breach
of
an
admiralty
warranty,
and
my
response
to
that
is,
no,
it
should
not,
because
that
again
is
the
question
of
what
should
be
the
policy
of
admiralty,
as
distinguished
from
the
policy
of
common
law
in
tort
cases.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
well,
i
would
make
the
same
response,
your
honor,
as
i
would
to
the
question
that
was
raised
in
italia
societa.
that
is
to
say,
it
is
true
that
but-for
the
breakage
of
the--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--i
have
not
seen
a
case
in
which
the
common-law
doctrine
of
superseding
cause
has
been
applied
to
relieve
a
defendant
in
an
admiralty
case,
or,
indeed,
another,
of
liability
for
breach
of
warranty,
although,
of
course,
it
does
go
to
the
question
of
how
much
damages
should
be
allowed.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
it
does.
what...
however,
i
think
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is...
i
would
put
somewhat
differently.
that
is,
in
a
breach
of
admiralty
warranty
case,
all
i
believe
that
one
needs
to
do
is
to
say,
what
was
within
the
contemplation,
or
should
have
been
within
the
contemplation
of
these
respondents
in
warranting
this...
that
the
berth
was
safe
when
they
knew
very
well
it
was
not,
and
one
of
the
consequences
would
be
that
the
vessels
would
strand.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
it
is
not
that
far
away,
your
honor,
looking
at
the
findings
and
giving
them
full
credence
from
the
court.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
not
any--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--there's
no
question
whatever
that
the
vessel
would
have
been
nowhere
near
the
reef
upon
which
she
stranded
but
for
the
undisputed
fact,
as
found
by
the
district
court,
that
this
vessel
was
burdened
with
this
enormous
cargo
hose
that
continued
to
be
a
danger
to
that
vessel
until
12
minutes
before
the
turn.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
and
i
would,
and
i
do
take
the
position
that
it
should
not
apply.
it
should
not
apply,
because
to
apply
it
under
circumstances
in
this
case
means
that
you
reach
results
that
are
antithetical
with
the
explicit
admiralty
policies
that
this
court
has
adopted
in
reliable
transfer.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
because
i
think
it
goes
to
who
should
bear
what
kind
of
risks
for
what
kinds
of
losses
in
order
to
achieve
the
policies
that
this
court
has
said
it
wishes
to
achieve
in
admiralty
law.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
the
only
reason
i
would
respond
it
is
not
appropriate,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
common
law,
superseding
cause
included,
is
made
in
50
states
by
multiple
courts
that
do
not
agree
with
each
other,
and
this
court
has
said
that
one
of
the
very
reasons
for
reaching
different
conclusions
is
to
strive
for
uniformity,
and
there
can
be
none
if
the
law
with
respect
to
what
will
be
applied
in
admiralty
is
going
to
be
made
by
multiple
courts
in
50
states.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
what
i've
said,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
i'm
not
aware
of
such
a
case,
but
what
that
conceals
is
how
differently
different
courts
have
perceived
how
superseding
cause
applies.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
i
would
suggest,
justice
souter,
that
that
would
not
be
your
conclusion.
i
would
suggest
that
you
would
actually
compare
the
degrees
of
fault,
as
this
court
taught
in
reliable
transfer,
and
in
doing
so,
in
comparing
those
degrees
of
fault,
when
you
discover
that
one
party,
or
in
this
case
several
parties,
were
tremendously
at
fault
and
the
shipowner
was
slightly
at
fault...
you
can't
decide
whether
somebody
is
grossly
negligent
unless
you're
comparing
it
with
something.
here,
there
is
no
comparison
possible,
because
the
court
excluded
all
of
the
evidence
of
what--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--yes.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
mm-hmm.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
i
contend,
justice
stevens,
that
it
is
a
conclusion
of
law.
it
is
not
a
finding
of
fact,
and
it
could
not
be
a
finding
of
fact
that
would
make
sense
because
it
is
already
admitted
that
one
of
the
causes--
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
--yes.
ms.
shirley
m.
hufstedler
that's
exactly
right.
if
i
may,
i
will
save
my
remaining
time.
