ms.
hufstedler,
on
that
point,
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
respondent
that
many
states,
in
fact
most,
now
have
comparative
negligence
systems,
and
in
none
of
those
has
the
supervening
cause
doctrine
been
declared
incompatible.
some
have
not
considered
it.
some...
a
couple
have
considered
it
and
said
they're
compatible.
my
question
is,
is
there
any
state
with
a
comparative
negligence
regime
that
has
said,
now
supervening
cause
is
no
longer
valid
because
it
conflicts
with
the
notion
of
comparative
negligence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
still
a
proximate
cause
requirement.
there's
still
a
causation
requirement,
and
i
couldn't
see
where
the
cases
you
cited
got
you
away
from
that.
you
still
have
to
prove
that
the
damage
was
caused
by
the
breach
of
warranty,
and
i
don't
see
how
you're
released
from
the
causation
by
shifting
over
to
contract
from
tort.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the--
--if
i
took
the
comparative
negligence
doctrine
from
the
common
development,
this
court
did,
took
that
over
as
part
of
admiralty
law.
why
wouldn't
it
be
natural
also
to
look
to
the
development
in
the
states
to
develop
the
comparative
law
doctrine
on
the
admiralty
side?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
answered
before
that
there
is
uniformity,
at
least
so
far
on
this
point,
that
there
is
no
state
that
has
said
supervening
cause
is
inconsistent,
incompatible
with
comparative
negligence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
may
be
a
mixed
question,
but
it
is
the
kind
of
question
if
you
had
a
judge-jury
you
would
give
it
to
a
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
going
back
to
justice
stevens'
question,
doesn't
that
underscore
the
impropriety
of
splitting
this
trial?
that
is,
in
order
to
determine
if
there
really
was
a
break
in
this
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
defendants,
one
would
have
to
have
the
whole
scene
played
out.
