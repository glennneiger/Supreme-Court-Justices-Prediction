well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
is
it
possible
to
have
a
so-called
superseding
cause
if
it's
not
caused
by
a
third
party?

if
it's
caused
by
the
plaintiff
itself?
justice

day
o'connor
i
don't
see
why
that
wouldn't
be
just
a
matter
of
comparable
negligence
rather
than
superseding
cause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is...
under
the
restatement,
does
it
contemplate
a
third
party?
