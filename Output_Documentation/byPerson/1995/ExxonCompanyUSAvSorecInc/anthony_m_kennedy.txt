justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
take
the
district
court
to
task
for
having
considered
causation
first
and
damages
second,
although
it
never
got
to
damages.
i
should
have
thought
it
would
have
been
strange
to
do
anything
else.
you
must
have
causation,
mustn't
you,
before
you
inquire
about
damages
and,
of
course,
that
leads
to
the
next
question,
do
you...
you're
not
telling
us,
i
take
it,
that
but-for
causation
suffices?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
must
have,
before
you
proceed
to
the
question
of
damages,
that
legal
cause,
that
cause
which
admiralty
courts
will
recognize
as
sufficient
to
impose
liability
on
the
tortfeasor--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i'm
asking
how
you
define
that,
other
than
but-for
causation,
because
i
take
it
it's
something
more.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
ms.--
--well--
--if
the
district
court
had
found
out
that
some
pirates
had
come,
obviously
unforeseen
cause,
i
suppose
he
wouldn't
have
proceeded
to
any
of
those
questions
either.
and
he
was
saying,
rightly
or
wrongly
as
a
matter
of
fact,
but
i
think
correctly
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
he
was
going
to
first
inquire
whether
or
not
the
negligence
of
the
captain's
tanker
was
a
supervening
cause
of
this
extraordinary
proportion,
and
you
weren't
foreclosed
in
producing
any
evidence
on
that
issue,
were
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
problem,
mrs.
hufstedler,
is
that
your
answers
to
justice
breyer,
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg,
justice
scalia,
all
are
discussions
within
the
regime
of
comparative
negligence,
and
i
think
you
concede
that
there's
supervening
cause.
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth.
i
think...
but
you've
presented
this
as
an
admiralty
case
where
the
rules
somehow
should
be
different.
that
was,
i
thought,
the
gravamen
of
the
question
presented,
and
i
don't
see
why
the
rule
should
be
different,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
don't,
either,
because
we've
been
discussing
this
in
the
regime
of
any
comparative
negligence
system,
admiralty
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
we're
just
talking
about
what
is
and
what
is
not
an
appropriate
supervening
cause.
that's
all
the
case
is
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
exxon
say,
did
it
ever
say
here
that
the
tort
was
concluded
when
the
ship
parted
from
the
mooring?
that
was
the
tort.
that's
the
tortious
conduct
here.
everything
else
is
simply
a
question
of
mitigating
damages,
or
avoidable
consequences.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
i
don't
see
some
independent
tort
coming
from
what
the
captain
did.
