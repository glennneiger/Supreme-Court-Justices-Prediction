mr.
george
w.
playdon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
found
by
the
courts
below.
they
are
unchallenged
by
exxon.
they
are
binding,
and
they
clearly
support
the
judgment
below.
we
simply
cannot
read
the
decision
of
reliable
transfer--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--oh,
i
think
they
all
favor
me,
justice
scalia.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
well,
i
think
you...
justice
scalia,
you
tried...
you
focused
in
on
the
presence
of
this
hose
that
remained
aboard
the
vessel
until
a
few...
12
minutes
before
that
final
fatal
turn
occurred.
let
me
offer
an
answer
to
your,
perhaps
question,
and
justify
how
judge
fong
actually
said
that
some
hour
and
17
minutes
earlier
before
that
hose
had
gone
off,
it
had
reached
a
point
of
safety.
at
that
time,
at
1830,
about
1
hour
and
2
minutes
after
the
breakaway,
that
vessel
had
traversed
the
leeward
coast,
it
had
gotten
itself
into
fair
water,
and
only
at
that
point
of
time,
when
the
captain
made
an
unforced
decision
to
linger
and
remain,
did
that
hose
become
a
problem.
and
the
hose,
justice
scalia,
was
under
the
control
of
the
assist
vessel
nene,
and
if
it
presented
a
problem,
it
was
a
problem
to
the
maneuverability
of
the
vessel,
not
to
the
navigation
of
the
vessel,
and
it
was
the
navigation
of
the
vessel
subsequent
to
this
time,
the
navigation
subsequent
to
this
1830,
that
resulted
in
the
stranding
of
the
vessel
an
hour
and
39
minutes
later.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
whatever
risk
it
was,
justice
scalia,
he
had--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--if
not
he,
then
someone
else
on
his
bridge
that
should
have
been
there
to
do
so.
the
vessel
needed
to
be
navigated.
the
captain
was
there
to
navigate
the
vessel,
not
to
micromanage
what
was
going
on
on
the
deck,
and
what
was
going
on
on
the
deck
was
a
hazard
to
the
vessel
only
because
of
the
unforced
decisions
that
were
made
by
the
captain
an
hour
and
17
minutes
earlier.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
i
would
differ
with
the
justice,
but
i
will
accept
that's
your
opinion.
the
doctrine
of
superseding
cause
has
been
part
and
parcel
of
the
law
of
admiralty
for
literally
generations.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
yes.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
certainly.
i
see
nothing--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--well,
certainly--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--the
key
part
of
the
restatement,
section
442,
actually
contemplates
an
intervention
to
bring
about
a
harm
different
in
kind
than
that
which
would
otherwise
have
resulted.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
i
disagree.
i
believe
it
can
be
any
act
that
occurs
after
the
initial
act.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
well,
third...
yes,
it
does,
justice--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--i
believe
the
acts
of
the
captain
are
the
third
party,
but--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--well,
he
was
with
his
acts,
and
the
gross
negligence
of
the
operation
of
the
vessel
subsequent
were
in
fact
found
by
judge
fong
to
be
that
supervening--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--yes.
his
employment--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--i
think
it
was
specifically
found
by
the--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--it
wouldn't
make
any--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--no,
but--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--yes,
justice.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
yes.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
it's--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--yes.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
i
don't
believe
anybody
did.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
i
don't.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
justice
breyer,
i
don't
know.
it
would
seem
to
make
no
logical
sense
to
have
it
apply
in
any
other
sense
than
in
the
context
in
which
it
is
being
presented
in
this
particular
action.
clearly,
a
superseding
cause
should
be
one
that
occurs
after
an
initial
event,
and
surely
superseding
cause
should
be
used
to
terminate
a
liability
at
some
point
of
time
short
of
eternity,
just
as--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--you
have
suggested
there
may
come
a
logical
time
at
some
point
when,
in
fact,
an
act
ceases
to
act,
and
in
this
particular--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--i
wouldn't
be
as
quite
concerned
with
the
semantics
as
when
we're
looking
at
the
doctrine.
we're
looking
at
the
doctrine
of
when
does
the
act
of
someone
else,
whether
it
is
the
captain
or
the
employee,
or
submarine
captain,
or
something,
operate
to
block
any
prior
fault,
so
that
that
prior
fault
just
simply
no
longer
is
active
in
the
scenario.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
well,
i
think
judge
fong--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--justice
kennedy,
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
because
i
think
what
you
found
and
what
you
saw
here
in
the
application
by
judge
fong
was,
in
fact,
independent
fault
in
the
faulty
navigation
of
the
vessel
of
making
a
wrong
turn
without
knowing
where
he
was,
violating
the
louisiana--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--let
me
then
perhaps
argue
from
a
different
perspective,
justice
kennedy.
the
harm
that
was
envisioned
by
the
breakout
from
the
mooring
at
28
minutes
past
5
in
the
evening
would
be
that
that
vessel
would
somehow,
before
it
regained
control
of
itself,
find
itself
aground
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mooring.
that
was
the
harm
that
was
envisioned
if,
in
fact,
the
breakout
was
a
cause.
but
what
we
have
here
is,
we
have
a
passage
of
almost
3
hours
where
a
fully
manned,
fully
staffed,
fully
functional
tanker
managed
to--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--yes.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
well,
now,
justice
stevens,
what
you're
doing
is
you're
going
in
and
we're
sort
of
changing
the
fact
pattern
a
bit.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
absolutely.
if
there
had
been
such
a
factfinding
that
the--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--i
think
both
of
those
things,
justice
stevens.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
well,
it
wasn't
found
by
the
court
below.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
it
certainly
wasn't.
now,
if
we
are
to
assume--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--probably
both.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
i
meant
that
given
the
facts
as
they
are
below,
and
they
are
not
challenged
in
this
court,
that
such
a
finding--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--well,
remember
that
judge
fong,
he
sort
of
gave
us
a
safety
valve
when
he
said
look,
if
i've
made
findings
of
fact
that
are
really
conclusions,
they
should
be
held
to
be
conclusions,
and
if
i
made
conclusions
that
are
really
findings,
then
they
should
be
deemed
by
findings,
and
that's
what
we're
saying.
the
finding
of
causation,
of
proximate
cause,
is
a
factual
finding.
it's--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--certainly.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
absolutely.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
yes,
justice
souter,
it
is,
and
insofar
as
it
contains
the
factual
determination
that
in
fact
captain
coyne
was
the
sole
proximate
cause,
that
is
a
factfinding
that
this
court,
i
think
under
the
two-court
rule
referred
to
by
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
one
that
they're
bound
to
adhere
to.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg,
and
in
this
particular
case
judge
fong
was
both
the
judge
and
the
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
justice
ginsburg.
let
me
indicate
that
perhaps
we
might
take
some
note
of
the
union
oil
v.
san
jacinto
case,
where
3
years
before
reliable
transfer
this
court
took
that
case
thinking,
my,
this
may
be
the
case
to
deal
with
divided
damages.
and
then
the
court
took
a
look
at
it
and
said,
you
know,
and
the
orderly
disposition
of
issues
requires
addressing
the
issue
of
liability
before
we
address
the
question
of
damage,
and
when
it
went
through
the
analysis
it
found
that
there
really
wasn't
two
causes
of
this
particular
incident
on
the
columbia
river,
that
really
there
was
only
one
person
at
fault,
and
that
was
the
tug
coming
out
of
a
fog
bank
at
right
angles
and
striking
the
san
jac...
excuse
me,
the
santa
maria
as
it
was
proceeding
up
past
portland.
and
that
certainly
would
say
that
the
inquiry
done
by
judge
fong
is
not
only
appropriate
but
an
essential
part,
and
it's
clearly
within
his
mandate
of
rule
42(b),
which
gives
the
trial
court
sound
discretion
to
be
able
to
structure
a
case
so
that
it
can
be
conserving
of
its
time
and
resources,
recalling
that
this
particular
case
took
3
weeks
of
the
court's
time,
bench
time,
just
to
try
the
issue
of
causation.
so
surely
that
tort
of
examination
would
indicate
that
exxon
over
those
3
weeks
had
an
abundant
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
all
of
the
issues
and
to
present
all
of
the
proof
that
it
could
on
the
issue
of
causation.
they
simply
failed
to
be
able
to
prove
to
the
court
that
the
events
set
in
motion
by
the
breakout
proceeded
in
a
causal
manner
to
result
in
the
stranding
that
occurred
some
3
hours
later.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
no,
i
can't...
one
doesn't
come
to
mind,
justice
breyer.
you
know,
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
is
perhaps
the
most
illustrative
of
a
foreign
jurisdiction.
it
was
cited
in
the
corespondent's
brief,
and
that's
the
paludina
case
which
occurred
in
1927,
in
a
case
where
they
had
an
initial
breakout,
then
hit
another
vessel
that
hit
a
third
vessel,
and
then
the
vessels
were
separated
for
a
period
of
time,
and
then
the
sara
struck
another
vessel
and
they
tried
to
bring
in
the
original
vessel,
the
paludina.
and
basically
the
english
court
said,
now,
wait
a
minute,
whatever
was
started
by
the
paludina
had
long
since
passed
before
the
ultimate
harm.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
well--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--i
smiled.
i
never
envisioned
30
years
ago--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--that
i
would
have
the
opportunity
of
standing
before
you--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--of
arguing
pfalzgraf.
[laughter]
obviously,
pfalzgraf
is
a
foreseeability
doctrine,
just
like
hadley
v.
baxendale
is
a
foreseeability
problem.
i
think
that
the
supervening
cause
gives
us
a
set
of
sort
of
workable
parameters
within
which
we
can
work
this
doctrine
as
opposed
to
having
it
exist
as
merely
a
name,
or
a
title.
you
know,
one
of
the...
as
the
commentators
have
commented
on,
that
sometimes
it
becomes
difficult
to
apply
this,
and
perhaps
the
restatement
gives
us
some
sort
of
guidelines.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
sure.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
it
probably
may
not.
it
may
be
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
justice
scalia.
i
think
what
happened,
you
know,
in
practicality
is
that
when
the
trial
court,
when
judge
fong
was
presented
with
just
the
facts,
or
the
basic
facts
of
what
was
occurring,
that
the
grounding...
excuse
me,
the
stranding
that
occurs
3
hours
later
at
a
remote
distance
around
barbers
point,
that
that
just
in
and
of
itself
cried
out
for
a
proceeding
that
examined
causation.
and
when
he
examined
that
causation,
it
was
clearly
that
the
operative
events
of
the
breakout
simply
had
no
bearing
on
the
ultimate
harm.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
i
guess
we'd
have
to
ask
the
coast
guard.
i
mean,
they
had
buoy
tenders,
and
they
had
some
cutters
that
were
tied
up
in
honolulu
harbor,
i
guess
in
order
to
turn
the
o-n,
the
o-f-f
switch
and
get
that
vessel
moving
and
get
it
out
of
the
harbor
and
over
to
the
berth
would
have
taken
the
period
of
time.
that's
the
only
explanation
i
have.
actually,
in
point
of
fact,
justice
stevens,
there
was
a...
we
found
out
later
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial
that
there
was
a
navy
salvage
vessel
that
was
within
about
30
or
40
minutes
of
the
houston
but
was
never
called,
never
asked
for,
but
in
fact
was
one
of
the
responding
vessels
that
ultimately
helped
to
pull
the
vessel
off
the
reef.
members
of
the
court,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--oh,
absolutely,
justice...
i
was
looking
out
at
a--
mr.
george
w.
playdon
--i
don't
really
think
so.
you
know,
the
attempt
to
anchor
was
within
about
12
minutes
of
the
breakaway.
the
captain
felt
that,
you
know,
he
might
be
pulling
the
anchor,
and
maybe
he
didn't
think
to
pull
it
up
more
sharp
to
hold
the
vessel.
but
thereafter
he
then,
at
about
1803
the
little
assist
vessel
nene...
by
the
way,
it
was
about
65
feet,
and
75
tons,
and
800
horsepower...
had
that
hose
under
control,
and
they
backed
across
the
face
of
the
south
coast
of
oahu,
cleared
barbers
point,
and
that's
that
1830
position,
justice
stevens.
mr.
george
w.
playdon
in
summation,
we
just
believe
that
there
is
no
causal
nexus
to
any
of
the
breakout,
and
i
want
to
thank
the
court.
