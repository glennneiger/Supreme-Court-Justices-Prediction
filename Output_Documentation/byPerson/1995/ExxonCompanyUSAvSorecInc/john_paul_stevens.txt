justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
this
question
on
that
point.
how
would
you
measure
damages
for
the
breach
of
contract?
would
you...
in
an
admiralty
case.
would
you
not
use
the
comparative
fault
approach,
and
if
so,
why
wouldn't
a
finding
of
superseding
cause
be
the
equivalent
of
finding
zero
negligence,
or
is
there
a
responsibility,
is
there
a
fault?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
my
question
is
directed
at
the
merits
of
your
suggestion
we
apply
a
different
test
to
the
contract
claim
than
the
tort
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
on
that
point?
conclusion
of
law
44--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--contains
the
statement
that
the
negligence
of
the
captain
was
the
sole
proximate
cause
of
the
stranding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
accept
that?
should
we
accept
that
for
purposes
of
a
decision,
or
do
you
contend
that
because
it's
a
conclusion
of
law
we
should
review
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
push
you
one
step
further,
then.
if
it
is
a
conclusion
of
law,
must
we
disagree
with
it
to
accept
your
position
on
the
doctrine
of
superseding
cause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
that's
not
a
finding
of
fact,
so
we
may
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt--
--but
in
the
usual
case
we
think
about
an
independent
tort,
a
third
person,
the
submarine
captain
or
something,
creating
a
tort.
i
don't
see
a
second
tort
here.
i
see
an
initial
tort,
arguably
the
parting
of
the
chain,
followed
by
a
failure
to
mitigate,
or
a
failure
to
take
avoidable
consequences
of
damages
which
might
get
you
where
you
want
to
go,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
superseding
or
supervening
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
playdon,
let
me
interrupt
you
with
a
question.
so
you're
asking...
you're
saying
the
entire
cause
of
the
accident
was
the
navigational
errors
of
the
captain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
supposing
the
trial
judge
said
well,
why
did
he
make
these
navigational
errors?
one
reason,
presumably...
he
might
have
made
a
finding,
one
reason
was
that
he
was
still
concerned
about
the
hose
that
was
trailing
along
the
vessel.
that
distracted
him,
and
that
caused
him
to
only
give
90
percent
attention
to
navigation
where
he
should
have
given
100
percent
attention.
if
that
was
one
of
the
facts
that
caused
him
to
navigate
improperly,
why
would
that
not
have
been
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
his...
that
one
side
is
entirely
responsible
for
the
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
assuming
if
there
had
been
such
a
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
instead
we're
saying
he
was
just
dumb.
it's
100
percent
the
answer.
or
he
was
incompetent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
inconceivable
that
the
condition
of
the
ship
with
the
trailing
on
it
had
any
bearing
on
his
navigational
errors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
conclusion
of
law
based
on
an
assumption
that
such
a
finding
could
not
have
been
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
saying
we
should
treat
conclusion
of
law
44
as
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
playdon,
can
you
tell
me
one
fact
that
really
puzzles
me?
why
was
it
going
to
take
the
coast
guard
2
hours
to
get
vessels
out
there?
it
just
puzzled
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you've
got
a
minute
or
two
extra,
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
is
there
a...
there's
a
description
in
the
facts
here
about
negligence
which
occurred
before
1830.
is
that
relevant,
the
failure
to
let
the
anchor
down
all
the
way
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
