justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hufstedler,
my
problem
is
this.
i
didn't
think
we
took
this
case,
even
if
we're
able
to...
even
if
the
two-court
rule
does
not
apply,
to
make
essentially
factual
determinations
and
say
that,
you
know,
the
factual
findings
of
the
court
below
were
wrong,
or
even
that
the
findings
of
law
were
wrong,
except
in
one
regard.
i
thought
we
were
going
to
decide
whether
the
doctrine
of
supervening
cause
applies,
not
whether,
if
it
applies,
it
was
properly
imposed
by
the
court
here,
and
you're
turning
us
into
an
examination
of
whether
that
doctrine
has
been
properly
applied
here.
that's
not
how
i
read
your
question
presented.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
just--
--not
the
risk
of
stranding
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
away
on
a
reef
instead
of
on
shore.
i
mean,
that's
the
issue
here,
whether
the...
you
know,
the
negligence
in
berthing
gives
rise
to
a
risk
of
stranding
on
some
distant
reef,
and
why
can't
you
say...
by
the
way,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
that
there's
no
supervening
cause.
i'm
not
sure
that
cause
is
the
negligence.
i
mean,
the
immediate
cause
is
the
darned
reef
which
is...
which
destroys
the
ship,
and
can't
you
say
that
that
cause
is
a
supervening
cause,
apart
from
the
negligence
of
the
berthing?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
a
factual...
i
mean,
i
think
you
may
have
a
good
point
there,
but
that
goes
to
the
apparent
inconsistency
between
the
finding
that
the
negligence
had
terminated
and
that
finding
that
the
hose,
up
until
half-an-hour
before
the
grounding
was
still
giving
difficulty.
i
agree
that
those
two
findings
appear
incompatible,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
presented
of
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
doctrine
of
supervening
cause.
that
goes
to
the
application
of
the
rule,
which
is
not
the
reason
we
took
the
case.
maybe
it's
been
applied
incorrectly,
but
the
question
is,
does
the
rule
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
examine
in
principle
why...
i
don't
want
to
use
up...
i
know
you
want
to
reserve
some
time,
but
why
in
principle
should
shifting
to
comparative
negligence
make
any
difference?
before
we
shifted
to
comparative
negligence,
it
was
divided
50-50
whenever
there
was
any
negligence
on
either
side.
now,
why
would
assessing,
instead
of
50-50,
80-20,
or
90-10,
why
should
that
in
theory
have
any
effect
upon
the
doctrine
of
supervening
cause?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
ones
are
correct?
i
mean,
the
ones
that
favor
you,
or
the
ones
that
don't
favor
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
tend
to
contradict
each
other
is
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
captain
had
this
loose
boom
that
was
swinging
across
the
deck,
causing
risk
of
injury
to
seamen
and
also
causing
a
risk
of
explosion,
as
i
understand
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
wanted
him
to
sit
down
calmly
at
his
maps
and
chart
at
what
point
in
the
ocean
he
was
at
this
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
the
two
findings
are
hard
to
reconcile,
but...
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
now--
--of
course,
it
wouldn't
make
very
much
sense
to
have
a
doctrine
of
supervening...
i
mean,
maybe
you
want
to
give
it
a
different
name,
but
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that
the
defendant
gets
off
the
hook
if
some
third
party
caused
the
injury
that
the
plaintiff
is
suing
for,
but
the
defendant
does
not
get
off
the
hook
if
the
plaintiff
himself
caused
the
injury
that
the
plaintiff
is
suing
for.
that
wouldn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
don't
use
the
restatement.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
use
these
other
commentators
instead?
but
it's
just
a
question
of
terminology.
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
you're
saying,
and
when
you
use
superseding
cause,
i
take
it
you
are
using
it
not
in
the
restatement
sense
but
in
the
broader
sense
that
plaintiff's
acts
can
be
superseding
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
not
have
been
made,
or
was
not
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
not
have
been
made?
so
if
i
think
that
such
a
finding
could
have
been
made,
that
on
the
evidence
here
you
could
have
made
a
finding
that
he
was
distracted
by
the
hose
you,
think
i
should
find
against
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
you
meant
that.
then
what
did
you
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
given
the
facts
as
they
are
below,
or
given
the
findings
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
that
you
need
a
doctrine
of
supervening
cause.
isn't
the
doctrine
of
supervening
cause
anything
other
than
pfalzgraf?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
you
say,
you
know,
that
the
negligence,
the
causality,
they
had
long
since
terminated.
once
you
say
you're
out
of
the
scope
of
the
risk,
what
do
you
need
a
doctrine
of
supervening
cause
for?
and
isn't
that
basically
your
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
arguing
pfalzgraf,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
mean,
i
could
say
that
whenever
it's
beyond
the
scope
of
the
risk
under
pfalzgraf
i
could
say,
no,
you
were
not
the
cause
of
it.
there
was
this
other
cause,
because
basically
it
was
beyond
the
scope
of
the
risk
that
you
created.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
can
call
that
other
cause,
if
i
want,
a
supervening
cause,
and
i
guess
that
makes
everything
sound
nicer,
but
i
don't
know
that
it's
any
different.
