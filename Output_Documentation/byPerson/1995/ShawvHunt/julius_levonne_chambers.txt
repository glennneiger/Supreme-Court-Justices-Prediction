mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
would
first
begin
pointing
out
that
this
case
is
not
gomillion
v.
lightfoot.
nobody
has
excluded
any
citizen
of
north
carolina
from
participating
in
the
electoral
process.
black
and
white
citizens
are,
through
this
legislation,
provided
for
the
first
time
in
over
90
years
an
opportunity
to
now
have
a
voice...
an
opportunity
to
have
a
voice
in
the
election
of
congresspeople
in
north
carolina.
we
have
gone
through
a
period
in
north
carolina
where
we
have
purposely
discriminated
against
black
people.
we've
then
moved,
only
through
the
urging
of
legislation
and
this
court,
to
periods
where
we
have
permitted
blacks
to
register
and
vote.
we've
moved
to
the
voting
rights
act.
we
now
for
the
first
time
have
gotten
to
a
point
where
black
people
will
have
a
voice,
or
an
opportunity
to
have
a
voice
in
the
election
of
congresspeople,
and
i
hope
in
the
court's
review
of
this
case
it
appreciates
that
we're
operating
not
in
a
vacuum,
but
in
a
situation
where
we've
had
a
history
of
purposely
excluding
black
people.
and
now
we're
trying
to
devise
a
remedy,
and
that
remedy
is
one,
i
submit,
this
court
has
approved,
where
we
say
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
majority
black
district
in
order
to
give
black
people
an
opportunity
to
have
a
choice
in
who
represents
them
in
the
legislature.
nobody
is
guaranteeing
any
black
representative.
we
are
only
giving
people
a
voice,
and
we
know
from
the
decision
in
gingles
that
this
court,
and
that
the
congress
in
enacting
section
2,
felt
it
imperative
that
we
create
districts
where
people
would
have
a
real
voice
and
not
a
farce.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
we
had
a
district
in
north
carolina
that
provided,
we
thought,
an
opportunity,
with
42
percent
black
votes.
because
of
racially
polarized
voting
we
couldn't
elect
a
candidate
of
choice.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it's
because
the
candidate
was
not
the
representative
of
choice
for
african
americans
in
north
carolina.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
means,
your
honor,
the
same
thing
it
would
mean
for
you
if
you
didn't
have
a
voice
in
the
election
of
your
representative.
we've
gone
through
periods
where
we
know,
through
the
legislation
that's
been
passed
in
congress,
where
the
interests
of
black
people
haven't
been
represented.
congress
sought
through
the
legislation
in
1982
to
ensure
for
at
least
once
we
would
move
beyond
that,
and
now
we
have
this
chance
and
this
opportunity
through
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
ensure
that
black
people...
and
we
know
through
experiences
in
north
carolina,
and
this
court
found
this
in
gingles,
that
simply
providing
an
opportunity
district
would
not
ensure
the
kind
of
opportunity
that
african
americans
needed.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
in
this
case,
in
this
state--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--yes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
in
general,
i
would
say
that
if
we're
looking
at
a
congressional
district,
and
we're
looking
at
a
state,
i
would
submit
that
it
would
permit
the
state,
using
its
discretion,
which
is
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
raise
with
you,
to
decide
how
to
locate
that
particular
district
in
that
state
in
order
to
accommodate
that
injury.
the
injury,
i
submit,
is
to
all
the
people
in
north
carolina
who,
because
of
the
way
we
structured
the
system,
are
suffering
from
dilution
of
their
votes
and
not
having
a
voice
in
the
election
of
representatives.
now,
in
this
district
here,
we
had
two
plans...
the
court
asked
about
this...
that
assured
that
blacks
would
be
able
to
elect
a
representative
of
choice.
these
plans
are
in
the
record.
they
are
exhibit
10,
and
they're
filed
with
the
court,
and
they're
maps
that
were
run
through
the
legislature.
what
the
state
saw
was
it
could
draw
a
district
running
from
charlotte
or
gastonia
down
through,
either
to
wilmington
or
up
back
through,
near
raleigh.
these
were,
in
your
words,
compact
districts,
which
is
the
third
point
that
i
wanted
to
raise
with
you,
and
they
saw
the
potential
violation
of
section
2.
and
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
about
whether
gastonia
residents
could
file
a
lawsuit.
i
submit
to
you,
they
could.
you're
not
confining
this
to
gastonia.
you
could
begin
in
gastonia.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
they
would
show
it.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
we're
talking
about--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--yes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
would
submit,
the
way
we
have
proceeded
with
the
gingles
factors...
and
this
is
the
compactness
that
the
court
has
talked
about
here
today.
compactness
ought
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
what's
meaningful,
functional,
what
works.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
not
what
i
said,
your
honor.
remember,
too,
in
gingles
we
were
dealing
with
a
state
legislature,
state
houses,
state
senate
seats,
not
with
a
congressional
district,
and
second,
as
we
talked
about
compactness
and
contiguity,
we
were
assuming
that
that
was
what
was
necessary
in
order
to
ensure
that
we
bring
people
together
with
a
community
of
interest.
we
now
see
from
the
findings
in
this
court,
now
before
this
court,
that
we
can
look
at
things
that,
of
the
way
the
state
develops,
and
that's
the
peculiarity
of
north
carolina,
to
help
ensure
the
same
kind
of
community
of
interest,
the
same
kind
of
opportunity
of
people
working
together,
not
just
because
they're
black,
but--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i'm
not
arguing
for
proportional
representation.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i'm
not
arguing
for
proportional
representation.
even
if
we...
if
the
court
sustains
the
plan
here,
we
will
not
have
proportional
representation.
we
make
up
22
percent
of
the
population.
the
plans
would
guarantee
about
2
percent,
or
may
guarantee
at
least
an
opportunity
for
18
percent.
we're
not
talking
about
proportional
representation.
what
we're
talking
about
is
ensuring
at
once,
at
least
for
once,
a
chance
now
to
have
a
chance
to
have
a
voice
in
the
election
of
your
representatives.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
thank
you,
your
honor.
