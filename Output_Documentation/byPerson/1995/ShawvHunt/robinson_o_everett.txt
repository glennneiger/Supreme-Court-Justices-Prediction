mr.
robinson
o.
everett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
suppose
i
better
do
one
thing
at
the
outset
to
maintain
the
honor
of
north
carolina.
there
was
a
question
about
two
of
the
districts
in
texas
being,
i
believe,
the
least
compact
in
the
country,
and
i
have
here
perfect
evidence
that
we
have
four
of
the
least
compact.
justice
o'connor
will
remember
this
map,
because
it
was
appended
to
her
opinion
in
shaw
v.
reno,
and
the
twelfth,
i
think...
the
snake...
leads
the
country.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
the
court's
opinion,
one
which
you
authored.
i
apologize,
your
honor.
but
in
any
event,
the
court
became
aware
of
the
absence
of
compactness,
which
leads
into
another
point.
there
was
a
discussion
of
the
difference
between
narrow
tailoring
and
broad
tailoring.
i
think
we
have
here
the
exhibit
of
no
tailoring.
and
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
point,
just
to
explain
why
we
are
here,
and
perhaps
it
reflects
a
rather
naive
understanding
of
the
constitution,
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
my
impression
has
been
that
if
there
were
two
water
fountains
over
there,
one
of
which
said
african
american,
and
another
of
which
said,
women,
and
another
over
here
which
said
male,
and
said
white,
and
if
that
in
effect
was
here,
with
the
signs,
that
i
would
be
perfectly
entitled
to
go
to
any
one
of
those
four
fountains
and
drink
the
water.
the
water
would
be
the
same
everywhere,
but
the
court
nor
other
public
body,
no
state,
no
federal
body
could
approve
racial
classifications.
and
the
reason
we're
here
is
because
this
map
reflects
a
redistricting
plan
which,
in
effect,
is
a
racial
classification.
that's
what
this
is
about.
that
map
says
there
are
two
black
districts
and
there
are
ten
white
districts.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
they
can
vote
as
they
please,
justice
stevens,
but
on
the
other
hand
they
are
preconditioned
in
their
behavior
by
the
fact
that
these
districts
carry
a
message.
they
carry
a
message
for
the
voters--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor?
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
exactly.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we
are
saying
that
these,
though,
carry
a
message,
and
the
signs
would
be
impermissible.
this
court
did
that.
it
had
these
labels...
i
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
make
a
motion
and
get
an
injunction
and
have
those
signs
taken
down.
we
would
maintain
by
the
same
token--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
would
hope
at
least
we
could
get
a
majority,
but
in
any
event,
it
would
seem
to
me
what
we
are
saying
is
these
signs,
these
labels
should
be
removed.
now,
in
order
that
there's
no
question
about
the
status
and
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
and
the
plaintiff
intervenors,
i
should
note
that
according
to
the
court's
determination
the
plaintiffs
and
the
plaintiff
intervenors
have
established...
this
is
on
page
110a...
have
established
that
they
are
registered
to
vote
in
north
carolina
congressional
elections
and
that
the
challenged
redistricting
plan
assigns
them
to
vote
in
particular
electoral
districts,
at
least
in
part
because
of
their
race.
which
is
to
say
that
professor
shimm
is
assigned
to
the
12th
district
at
least
in
part
because
of
the
racial
determination.
he
is
a
white
fill
a
person,
and
on
the
other
hand
there
are
three
of
us
who
are
plaintiffs
who
are
assigned
to
the
2nd
district
because
of
our
race.
we...
because
our
district
was
bleached.
now,
interestingly
enough,
and
justice
scalia
called
attention
in
the
texas
case
to
an
example
of
what
we
might
refer
to
as
orwellian
doublespeak.
the
minority
opportunity
district
i
think
was
the
phrase.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we
would
maintain,
your
honor,
that
due
to
the
ripple
effect
all
these
plaintiffs
have
standing
as
to
all
the
districts.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
oh,
professor
shimm
and
mrs.
shaw
are
in
the
12th
district.
the
rest
of
us
are
in
different
districts.
none
of
us
is
in
the
1st
district,
but
the
1st
district
was
constructed
by
taking
the...
what
would
have
been
the
2nd
district
and
playing
around
with
it
and
changing
the
boundaries,
so
that
our
position
would
be
that
all
those...
and
this
is
really
the
rationale,
i
think,
of
the
court
below,
that
all
of
us
were
affected
because
of
the
seamless
web--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
don't
believe
they
made
it,
as
i
recall...
i
was
here
at
the
argument...
and
i
don't
think
it
was
articulated
in
that
particular
fashion,
but
our
position
would
be
this,
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter.
the
12th
district,
because
of
its
inner
penetration,
is
essential
to
the
plan.
if
you
knock
out
the
12th
district
there
is
no
plan,
and
as
a
consequence,
and
since
professor
shimm
and
mrs.
shaw
clearly
have
standing,
it
really
doesn't
make
much
difference.
the
question
is
before
you,
is
this
plan
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
would
say,
your
honor--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--it's...
i
would
say
that
in
this
particular
situation,
given
the
inner
penetration
of
the
plan,
that
would
be
true.
now--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
would
think
across
the
board
in
this
situation,
and
we
would
note
this,
your
honor,
that
the...
well,
i
will
admit,
cherokee
county,
over
here,
up
into
tennessee,
i'm
not
really
saying
that
i'd
have
much
standing
perhaps
to
challenge
that,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
everything
in
the
middle
and
the
eastern
part
of
north
carolina
is
so
tied
together
as
a
practical
matter
it
is
one
plan.
it
is
like
the
unitary
school
system
in
the
hays
case,
which
was
promulgated
from
one
source.
it's
a
unitary
plan,
and
we
would
maintain
we
have
standing.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
and
we
stress
it
in
our
brief
because
we
think
it's
important.
that
is,
what
was
said
2
1/2
years
ago
when
we
were
here,
and
what's
happened
in
between.
when
i
argued
the
case
2
1/2
years
ago
the
counsel
for
the
state
appellee,
and
this
is
pointed
out
in
our
brief
on
page
4,
said
this
case
is
about
the
legal
significance
of
two
facts.
first,
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
intentionally
created
two
majority
minority
congressional
districts.
second,
the
general
assembly
did
so
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
of
securing
preclearance
of
its
congressional
reapportionment
plan
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
court,
the
same
counsel
stated...
he's
not
here
this
time.
there's
a
different
counsel
for
the
state,
but
he
presumably
spoke
with
authority...
there's
no
dispute
here
over
what
the
state's
purpose
is.
there's
a
dispute
over
how
to
characterize
it
legally,
but
we're
not
in
disagreement
about
what
the
state
legislature
was
trying
to
do.
then
again,
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
27
of
our
brief
in
the
footnote,
counsel
for
the
state
defendant
stated
to
the
court
the
determining
factor
in
this
case
is
that
north
carolina
is
subject
to
section
5
preclearance,
and
then
later,
section
2
may,
depending
upon
the
particular
demographics
and
the
situation
of
the
state,
require
majority
minority
districting,
but
once
again,
that's
not
this
case.
so
we
were
here
2
1/2
years
ago
thinking
the
case
had
to
do
with
whether
or
not
section
5
was
involved,
and
the
state
put
forth
what
we
characterized
as
the
nuremberg
defense.
the
department
of
justice
made
us
do
it.
the
civil
rights
division
made
us
do
it.
they
wouldn't
give
us
preclearance.
and
i
was
also
here
during
the
argument
when
the
solicitor
general
was
asked
back
in
april
this
year
about
the
policy
of
the
department
of
justice,
and
it
seems
very
clear
from
the
findings
made
in
the
hays
case,
the
original
hays
case,
from
the
findings
in
the
georgia
case
which
you're
well
familiar
with,
from
everything
about
it,
that
just
as
was
said
here
to
this
very
court
2
1/2
years
ago
and
just
as
was
admitted
in
the
defendant's
answer,
they
did
it
in
order
to
get
preclearance.
what
did
they
do?
they
enacted
this
constitutional
monstrosity,
which
replaced
another
constitutional
monstrosity
but
a
less
aggravated
monstrosity.
they
did
it
in
order
to
get
preclearance.
so
when
we
left
here,
or
when
we
got
the
decision,
actually,
in
summer
of
1993,
and
we
read
about
the
gerrymander,
what
the
court
said,
racial
gerrymander,
strict
scrutiny,
we
thought
it
was
a
fairly
simple
case.
go
back...
can
we
prove
there's
a
racial
gerrymander?
of
course
we
can.
this
map
almost
speaks
for
itself.
everything
else
spoke
for
itself.
the
record,
the
submission
in
chapter
7
says
the
overriding
purpose
of
the
state,
the
state
of
north
carolina,
is
to
create
these
districts
and
to
obtain
preclearance.
how
could
it
be
clearer?
so...
but
there
are
some
very
ingenious
counsel
on
the
other
side,
and
then
we
learned
that
it
wasn't
really
a
racial
gerrymander,
oh,
no,
and
it
wasn't
just
section
2,
oh,
no,
and
it
wasn't...
i
mean,
it
wasn't
just
section
5,
pardon
me.
it
was
also
section
2,
and
it
was
also
remedying
past
discrimination.
very
innovative,
and
moreover,
we
didn't
have...
none
of
us
had
standing.
everything,
we
had
all
of
it.
the
state
appropriated
half
a
million
dollars
to
put
up
this
defense.
various
people
came
in
to
battle
us
along
the
way.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
i
used
to
teach
evidence
a
couple
of
times.
we
have
prior
inconsistent
statements
that
are
admissible
because
they
intend
to
impeach.
if
that
isn't
a--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
i'd
say--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--that's
the
only
question,
they
say.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
they
are
in
this
context,
justice
souter.
they
are
inconsistent
when
it's
a
question
of
what
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
intended
in
january--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
let
me--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--let
me
say
in
this
context
they
are
very
inconsistent.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--if--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--justice
scalia--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--justice
scalia,
if
they
didn't
intend
to
do
it,
they
didn't
intend
to
do
it,
they
can't
justify
it.
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--that
is
part
of
our
position,
your
honor.
we
think
that
is--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
if
it
is
a
matter
of
justifying
something
under
strict
scrutiny
something
that
is
a
racial
gerrymander,
and
if
the
legislature
that
adopted
the
racial
gerrymander
didn't
even
think
about
it,
then
we
would
maintain
that
in
order
to
have
the
integrity
of
equal
protection
and
to
protect
the
constitutional
rights
of
us
voters,
yes,
that
should
be
disregarded.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
they
are
estopped
from
considering
it,
or
anything
of
that
sort.
what
i
would
suggest
is,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
since
they
said
section
5--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--fine.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
sure.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
two
aspects
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
they'd
have
to
be
sure
there
is
no
fruits
of
the
poisonous
tree,
there
is
no
carryover
from
the
alleged--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
we're
going
to
take
an
outlandish
position.
we
don't
believe
that
under
section
2
that's
enough
to
protect
it
from
constitutional--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
would
maintain
that,
given
the
purposes
of
section
2
as
we
understand
it,
that
it
would
not
be
permissible
to
use
it
as
a
vehicle
for
imposing
two
majority
minority
districts
in
a--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we
do
not
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
constitutes
a
compelling
interest,
given
the
purposes
of
section
2
and
its
process
orientation,
and
by
the
way,
there's
an
excellent
discussion
of
that
by
professor
blumstein
in
his
recent
rutgers
law
review
paper.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
our
position
would
be
that
section
2
as
properly
construed
and
narrowed
is
probably
constitutional,
but
that
certainly
to
use
it
as
a
vehicle
for
compelling
majority
minority
districts
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
we
say
this.
if
it
is
a
label
of
race,
they
say
we
want
a
black
district,
we
want
a
hispanic
district,
and
that's
the
purpose,
and
that's
the
label,
then
that
in
our
view
at
least,
right
or
wrong,
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection...
now,
obviously--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--on
our
reasoning
a
good
deal
of
the
redistricting
that
followed
the
1990
census
was
unconstitutional
because
it
is
result
oriented
in
a
manner
of
labeling
just
like
labeling
the
water
fountains
in
my
example.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
if
it's
a
matter
of,
say,
democrat
republican,
that's
certainly...
if
it--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--if
the
goal
is
defined
by
race,
then
our
position
is
it's
impermissible,
as,
for
example,
in
the
case--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--if
it's
voter...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
exactly,
your
honor,
but
if--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--there's
no
race
there,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
we
think
the
goal
is
impermissible.
let
me
analogize
this.
i
can
see
the...
well,
if
you
want
to
have
democrats
control
or
republicans,
or
whatever
it
is,
look
at
the
registration
of
those,
you
may
know
that
there's
a
heavy
democratic
registration,
say
in
north
carolina
where
95
percent
of
the
african
americans
are
registered
as
black.
you
may
know
that
where
there's
a
95...
a
heavy
democratic
registration
there
probably
is
a
very
substantial
african
american
population.
so
what?
but
what
i
am
concerned
about,
and
perhaps
this
is
because
of
my
reading
or
misreading
of
the
peremptory
challenges
cases,
my
understanding
is
that
if
i
look
at
a
juror,
i
have
a
peremptory
challenge,
and
i
say,
that
juror
is
black,
therefore
i
don't
want
him
in
this
particular
case,
or
that
juror
is
a
woman
and
i
don't
want
her
in
that
particular
case,
and
i
use
a
stereotype,
and
i
use
a
classification,
that
is
wrong.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
as
in
the
hernandez
case
where
you
were
dealing,
as
i
recall,
with
peremptory
challenges,
i
say,
this
hispanic
may
be
interpreting
for
himself
or
herself
the
testimony
being
given,
rather
than
going
through
an
interpreter,
then
i
can
challenge
him
off.
it's...
as
we
view
it,
and
we
perhaps
take
hirabayashi
and
the
later
cases
too
seriously,
but
we
really
take
it
very
seriously
that
racial
classifications
are
odious
and
are
subject
to
stricture.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
that
may
sound
extreme.
if
i
take
that
position--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
we--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
justice
breyer,
we
do
view
race
as
having
a
special
significance.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
no.
we
would
say
that
if
there
is,
let's
say,
a
jewish
district,
and
if
professor
shimm,
who
is
jewish,
is
put
there
because
he
is
jewish--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--our
distinction
is
in
terms
of
purpose,
very
much
like
the
batson
situation,
where,
if
there
is
a
purpose
to
do
it
on
a
racial
basis
or
an
ethnic
basis
or
a
religious
basis
or
a
gender
basis,
then
that
is
impermissible.
now,
hopefully...
hopefully,
when
this
court
makes
that
message
loud
and
clear
that
this
is
impermissible
unless
it
can
survive
strict
scrutiny,
hopefully
people
will
get
the
message
and
it's
not
going
to
happen
in
that
city
council,
just
like
now
you
don't
have
problems
about
equipopulousness
to
the
same
extent.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
leaped
over
in
my
enthusiasm
into
another
area
of
gender,
and
that
is
certainly
a
different--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
so
many
circumstances
totally
different
from
those
in
north
carolina--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
one
thing
that
would
be
very
important
is
the
sort
of
consideration
that
was
outlined
of
totality
of
circumstances
in
johnson--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--that's
it.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
that's
exactly--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
think--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--yes.
our
position
is
that--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--race
is
impermissible.
you
can't
use
it
for
a
purpose...
we
cannot
really
think
of
any
situation
where
it
could
be--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--the
evidence--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--as
to
majority
minority
districts
in
almost
anything,
any
situation
we
can
conceive
of,
if
they
are
created
for
a
racial
purpose
per
se,
we
believe
they
cannot
survive.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
i'm
descending
from
the
theoretical
to
the
practical
in
that
we
have
been
unable
to
conceive
of
anything,
at
least
in
our
limited
experience,
which--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
would
consider
that
it
could
not
be,
for
the
creation
of
majority
minority
districts.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
absolutely
not.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
our
secondary
position
is
that
it
is
clear
there
was
not
a
reevaluation
of
section
2,
that
the
section
5
denial
of
preclearance
tainted
everything,
that
just
as
the
state
represented
when
it
came
up
here
the
first
time,
it
was
a
matter
of
fulfilling
the
mandate
of
the
justice
department
just
as
it
was
in
miller,
and
therefore
this
should
fall,
just
as
the
georgia
redistricting
fell.
moreover,
there
was
no
totality
of
circumstances
analysis.
there
is
no
ability
to
satisfy
the
gingles
preconditions
to
whatever
extent
they
still
are
preconditions.
there
is
an
actual,
very
overt,
mathematically
demonstrable
error
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
there
can
be
created
two
geographically
compact
majority
minority
districts.
you
can
tell
from
this
map
and
from
the
maps
that
show
the
concentrations
of
black
population
that
it
is
simply
impossible.
the
court
completely
misconstrued
the
numerical
facts,
including
one
of
the
tables,
and
when
you
take
all
of
that
together,
the
section
2
compliance
argument
is
an
afterthought.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
oh,
your
honor--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
know
what
you're
talking
about.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
your
honor,
majority
black
is
50
percent.
the
very
table
that
was
relied
on
by
the
majority
below
shows
44
percent.
forty
four
percent
is
less
than
50
percent,
and
therefore
as
a
matter
of
mathematically
demonstrable
fact,
the
court
was
wrong.
they
also
refer
to
other
examples
of
geographically
compact
districts.
those
other
districts
contain
the
equivalent
of
section
12.
now,
if
anyone
here...
some
things
you
can
see,
and
i'm
sure
all
of
you
all
have
20/20
vision
jurisdically
and
otherwise.
you
can
see
that
that
is
not
geographically
compact.
so
they
create
new
concepts,
functional...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
