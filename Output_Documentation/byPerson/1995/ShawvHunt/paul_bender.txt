mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
let
me
start
with
the
question
that
has
occupied
the
court
during
much
of
this
argument,
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether,
if
the
gingles
factors
are
satisfied
so
that
there's
a
compelling
interest
in
satisfying
section
2
by
drawing
minority
majority
districts,
whether
the
state
can
then
locate
those
districts
anywhere
in
the
state.
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
state
can
locate
them
anywhere
in
the
state,
and
in
this
case
the
state
did
not
locate
them
anywhere
in
the
state.
the
district
12
which
was
ultimately
drawn
here
contains
two
areas,
the
charlotte
area
here,
and
the
durham
area
here,
which
are...
contain
a
substantial
part
of
the
black
population.
in
this
district
charlotte
alone
contains
a
little
over
30
percent
of
the
black
population
in
this
district.
durham
contains
some
more.
both
of
those
areas
were
in
a
compact
district
in
the
shaw
ii
plan
that's
in
the
joint
appendix.
it's
this
plan
here.
charlotte
was
in
this
district,
and
durham
was
in
this
district,
so
there's
a
substantial
overlap
between
those
people.
and
in
addition,
another
limiting
criterion,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
district
must
be
placed
in
an
area
so
that
the
majority
of
the
black
population
in
the
district
has
been
a
victim
of
the
polarized
voting
that
invoked
section
2,
and
a
majority
of
that
population
is
politically
cohesive
with
other
minorities
in
the
state
who
have
been
the
victims
of
that,
and
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case,
which
are
amply
supported
by
the
evidence,
are
that
that
was
exactly
true
here.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
if
north
carolina
had
wanted
to
create
a
district
in
which
farmers
were
a
majority,
there's
no
constitutional
principle
which
would
stop
it
from
creating
a
noncompact
district
like
that.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
not
a
district
based
on
race.
section
2
only
would
justify
a
district
for
minority's
interests.
but
i
was
saying,
there
are
other...
take
the
desire
of
a
state
to
create
the
district
that
has
a
majority
of
farmers
in
it.
i
take
it
that
that's
a
legitimate
interest
that
a
state
could
have,
and
that
a
state
in
vindicating
that
interest
could
design
a
noncompact
district.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
that
the
state
acted
not
to
satisfy
a
desire
of
the
states,
but
to
satisfy
an
obligation
of
the
states,
an
obligation
to
comply
with
federal
law,
an
obligation
to
comply
with
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
i
can't
believe
that
when
the
state
acts
to
satisfy
a
statutory
and
perhaps
even
a
constitutional
obligation
xx
has
less
discretion
in
doing
that,
in
employing
its
other--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
i
think
in
this
area,
justice
o'connor,
the
state
can
act
on
the
basis
of
race
in
order
to
create
a
majority
minority
district
in
order
to
counteract
the
effects
of
past
voting
discrimination,
which
was
present
in
north
carolina
for
a
long
time,
and
the
legacy
of
that
discrimination,
which
is
the
polarized
voting.
it's
unusual
that
a
state
can
do
that,
and
it--
mr.
paul
bender
--there
are
not--
mr.
paul
bender
--as
far
as
we
can
tell,
there
were
not
two
majority
black
districts.
mr.
paul
bender
this
is
the
majority--
mr.
paul
bender
--but
the
obligation
under
gingles
is
to
create
a
minority
opportunity
district.
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right,
but
that
would
have
forced
the
state--
mr.
paul
bender
--two
points
there.
one,
they
chose
to
do
that
because
if
they
had
done
this
district,
this
would
be
a
district
that
had
almost
no
coherence
except
that
it
was
a
minority
majority
district.
this
district
mixed
rural
and
urban
people
together,
there
was
no
community
of
interest
there,
and
a
second
reason
they
didn't--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
that
80
percent
of
them
are
urban,
and
the
state
deliberately
decided
to
create
an
80
percent
urban
district
here,
and
an
80
percent
rural
district
here,
as
a
purpose.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
in
doing
this--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
don't
know
what
they
punched
into
the
computer,
but
they--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
there
is.
section
2
says
that
if
minorities
are
denied
a
fair
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
political
process
because
of
racial
polarization
in
voting
and
because
the
minorities...
and
when
the
minorities
are
cohesive,
then
you
have
to
create
a
majority
minority
district
for
them.
now,
it's
true
that
in
this
case,
as
you
pointed
out
a
number
of
times,
the
second
district
that
was
compact
was
not
a
majority
minority
district,
it
was
a
49
point
something
percent
minority
district,
and
of
that
49
percent,
i
think
about
42
percent
were
black,
and
about
7
percent
were
native
americans.
the
statute,
section
2,
which
is
what
we're
applying
here,
doesn't
require
a
majority
minority
district.
gingles
said
that,
but
i
think
it
said
that
as
an
approximation.
what
the
statute
requires
is
to
give
the
minorities
a
fair
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
political
process,
and
how
much
of
a
percentage
of
minorities
you
need
to
do
that
depends
upon
the
extent
of
polarized
voting.
mr.
paul
bender
you're
talking
about
the
district--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes.
mr.
paul
bender
that
district
would
have
had
about
42
percent
black.
mr.
paul
bender
but
that
would
have
been
a
district
in
which
minorities
would
have
had
a
fair
opportunity
to
have
candidates
of
choice
elected,
because
they
would
have
had
a
sizeable
enough
population
so
that
with
a
right
cross
over
voting--
mr.
paul
bender
--there
was
evidence,
i
believe,
that
the
two
groups
voted
as
a
cohesive
minority,
and
all
of
those
factors
are
perfectly
relevant,
completely
relevant,
necessarily
relevant
under
section
2.
so
you
shouldn't
have...
if
it's
49.9
percent
it's
no
good,
and
if
it's
50.1
it
is.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
the
sense
here
is
to
give
minorities
a
chance
to
participate
fairly
in
the
political
process
and
north
carolina
has
done
that.
you
can't
force
north
carolina
to
abandon
other
nonracial
redistricting
principles
like
keeping
communities
of
interest,
urban
and
rural,
together,
or
like
satisfying
incumbency
protection.
mr.
paul
bender
you
can't
force
them
to
give
those
up.
mr.
paul
bender
those
nonracial
principles?
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
they
have
to
be
historically
justified.
they
have
to
be
nonracial,
and
principles
that
the
state
wishes
to
use
for
nonracial
reasons.
mr.
paul
bender
i
agree.
mr.
paul
bender
tradition
is
a
very
good
way
of
showing
that
they
weren't
done
here
for
racial
reasons,
but
if
you
are
convinced,
as
the
court
was
in
this
case,
that
they
are
not
done
for
racial
reasons,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
this
is
the
first
time
they
decided
that
they
needed
to
have
an
urban
district
because
of
urban
problems
that
had
recently
arisen
and
they
think
that
it's
important
for
those
people
to
vote
together,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
that's
just
happened
in
the
last
10
years
should
disqualify
them
from
doing
it.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
