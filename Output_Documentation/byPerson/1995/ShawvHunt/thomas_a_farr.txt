mr.
thomas
a.
farr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
speaking
for
the
plaintiff
intervenors,
i
would
like
to
state
what
we
think
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
what
is
not
at
issue.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
at
issue.
we
believe
that
it
is
constitutional.
nor
do
we
think
that
whether
compliance
with
section
2
might,
under
the
right
case,
serve
some
compelling
governmental
interest,
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
we
think
under
the
right
case
it
may
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
so
you
create
a
district
that
would
satisfy
section
2.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
it
is
not
a
compelling
state
interest
in
this
case,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
first,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
would
show
that
the
district
adopted...
met
the
gingles
preconditions.
there
would
be
no
plaintiff,
i
think,
in
the
united
states
would
walk
into
a
district
court
with
this
map
and
say
these
are
two
geographically
compact
districts
that
entitle
us
to
remedial
relief
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
other
reason,
your
honor,
why
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
is
because
no
one
in
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
believed
that
they
were
creating
these
districts
to
remedy
violations
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act,
and
it's
very
clear
that
what
north
carolina
believed
it
was
doing,
because
they
said
so,
they
made
this
statement
in
their
submission
in
support
of
chapter
7
to
the
justice
department
pursuant
to
section
5,
was
that
they
were
creating
these
districts
to
respond
to
the
dictates
of
the
justice
department
for--
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
--your
honor,
i
think
that
there's
evidence
in
this
case
from
which
it
might
be
concluded
that
a
majority
black
district
could
be
created
in
northeastern
north
carolina--
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
--and
that
a
majority
minority
district
could
be
created
running
from
charlotte
to
the
southeastern
part
of
the
state.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
two
majority
black
districts
that
are
reasonably
geographically
compact
could
be
created
in
this
case.
it's
not
been
presented
by
anyone.
now,
we
believe,
your
honor,
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
state
did
not
comply
with
what
is
stated
in
croson
and
wygant,
that
they
have
to
have
substantial
racism
evidence
at
the
time
that
they
adopt
a
racial
based
remedy,
assuming
that
they
had
done
that,
your
honor.
the
only
defense
that
they
have
in
this
case
is
if
the
court
adopts
the
notion
that
you
may
place
a
remedial
district
somewhere
else
in
north
carolina
besides
the
part
of
the
state
where
the
violation
has
been
proven,
and
we
think
that's
a
very
novel
concept
under
every
other
area
of
law,
and
it
ought
to
be
a
novel
concept
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
--your
honor,
we
think
that
this
right
under
the
voting
rights
act
is
not
a
right
that
is
enjoyed
by
any
minority
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
it
is
the
right
to
be
free
from
vote
dilution,
and
i
believe
that
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
in
the
gingles
case
makes
it
very
clear
that
these
cases
are
very
district
specific,
that
you've
got
to
prove
the
gingles
conditions
in
the
district
in
which
you're
trying
to
show
the
violation.
and
if
i
might
explain
a
little
bit
what
happened
in
north
carolina,
there
is
an
argument
that
you
could
make
a
reasonably
compact
majority
minority
district
running
from
charlotte
to
the
southeastern
part
of
the
state.
this
was
not
done
for
incumbency
protection
reasons.
that's
undisputed
that
that's
why
this
was
not
adopted.
it's
the
only
district
that
the
justice
department
pointed
out
in
its
objection
letter,
and
again,
as
stated
earlier,
there's
no
evidence...
justice
certainly
did
not
suggest
a
majority
black
district.
they
suggested
a
majority
minority
district.
in
running
this
district
up
i
85,
the
district
took
in
the
black
population
in
charlotte,
which
constituted
approximately
a
third
of
the
total
minority
population
that
would
have
been
in
existence
if
we
had
adopted
a
majority
minority
district.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
your
honor,
we--
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
--we
would--
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
--well,
we
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor's
position
on
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
there's
evidence,
nor
was
there
ever
any
intention
to
say
that
the
state
legislature
should
look
at
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
conclude
that
minorities
are
entitled
to
proportional
representation
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
we
believe
what--
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
would
fail
the
narrow
tailoring
requirement
of
strict
scrutiny,
and
specifically,
your
honor,
it's
these
people
in
this
part
of
north
carolina
that
had
their
votes
diluted.
they're
the
ones
that
have
been
subject
to
an
injury.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
that's
very
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
yes,
i
don't
think
incumbency
protection
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
your
honor,
and
in
fact--
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
concede
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
well,
if
i
understood
your
question,
you
were
saying,
and
justice
scalia,
we
believe
it's
a
very
difficult
case
to
prove
a
section
2
violation,
and
i
hope
i
have
a
chance
to
explain
that
before
i
sit
down,
but
justice
souter,
we
again
believe
that
the
remedy
must
go
to
the
people
who
have
been
injured,
and
if--
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
--i
think--
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
--well,
i
don't
believe
we
are,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
yes.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
well,
your
honor,
first
you're
assuming
that
incumbency
protection
is
the
type
of
traditional
districting
principle
that
the
court
was
referring
to
in
the
miller
case.
mr.
thomas
a.
farr
your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
great
distinction,
because
when
you're
talking
about
political
subdivisions
or
county
lines,
you're
talking
about
neutral
criteria,
and
i
believe
that
the
court
discussed
those
issues
as
a
frame
of
reference
to
show
in
a
case
involving
circumstantial
evidence
whether
or
not
you
could
prove
the
intent
element
of
the
miller
claim.
with
incumbency
protection
that
is
a
far
more
subjective
factor,
and
justice
souter,
drawing
a
majority
minority
district
has
to
be
done
for
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
and
we
would
suggest
that
doing
it
to
protect
an
incumbent
is
not
compelling.
doing
it
to
possibly
comply
with
a
section
2
violation
is,
and
if
you
are
doing
that,
you
must
draw
the
district
where
the
section
2
violation
exists.
