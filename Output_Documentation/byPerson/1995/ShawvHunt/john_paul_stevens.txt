paul
stevens
does
it
say
that
the
people
in
those
districts
can
drink
at
either
water
fountain?
can
they
vote
both
either
democratic
or
republican,
as
they
choose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
message
your
signs
carry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
message
that
your
signs
carry,
i
guess,
but
they
actually
didn't
inhibit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
pick
the
fountain
you
wanted
to
pick.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
everett,
supposing
you
have
a
case
in
which
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
legislature
decided
to
create
two
majority
minority
districts,
is
there
any
way
in
the
world
in
which
the
plan
could
survive
strict
scrutiny?
what
factors
would
enable
it
ever
to
survive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
just
hypothetically,
what
are
the
kind
of
factors
that
would
enable...
is
there
any
set
of
facts...
your
argument
is
pretty
firm,
it
seems
to
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
if
we
know
they
wanted
two
minority
majority
districts,
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
way
to
get
by
the
strict
scrutiny
hurdle
if
that
original
intent
is
established,
and
i
don't
think
there's
much
doubt
about
it
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
you
need
all
this
funny
map.
they
wanted
to
comply
with
what
they
thought
was
necessary
to
satisfy
the
department
of
justice,
and
they
created
two
majority
minority
districts.
why
do
we
have
to
have
a
trial?
that's
really
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
really
the
shape
merely
confirms
the
other
evidence
of
intent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
your
first
reason?
why
does
that
map
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
it
was
possible
to
create
a
compact
district,
majority
minority
compact
district?
that
map
doesn't
tell
us
anything
about
where
people
live.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
