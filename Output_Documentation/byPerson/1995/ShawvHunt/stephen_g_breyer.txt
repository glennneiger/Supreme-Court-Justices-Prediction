justice
stephen
g.

so
then
you
would
say
the
same
principle
applies
to
every,
whether
it's
a
city
council,
whether
it's
any
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
elections
that
if
people
draw
boundaries
to
a
significant
extent
on
the
basis
of
race,
i
take
it,
of
religion,
of
ethnic
background,
of
sex,
of
anything
of
that
nature,
that
that
then
will
come
into
federal
court
and
they
will
then
look
and
see
if
significant
boundaries
in
this
local
city
council
race,
or
whatever,
a
significant
number
of
those
boundaries
was
drawn
with
religion
in
mind
or
ethnicity.
is
that
actually
what
you're
thinking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
that
maybe
preferable
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--saying
that
you
can't
do
this
in
the
case
of
a
black
effort
but
you
can
do
it
in
the
case
of
any
other
effort.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
make
a
distinction
between--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
agree
with
you
on
that
failure
and
difficulty
of
distinguishing,
if
that
is
your
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean,
you
could
in
fact
say
they
cannot
gerrymander
or
draw
boundaries
on
the
basis
of
race,
but
you
can
draw...
if
the
person
is...
to
benefit
african
americans,
but
you
can
do
exactly
the
same
thing
for
the
purpose
of
benefiting
the
jews
or
the
catholics
or
any
other
group
in
society?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
are
you
distinguishing
whether
it's
a
whole
district,
or
part
of
a
district,
or
what
is...
i'm
trying...
what
are
you
distinguishing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
a
map
here
that
says
plan
nec
shaw
ii
type
tgb,
shaw
ii,
map
2--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--isn't
that
the
compact
one?
do
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wasn't
that
the
compact,
with
two?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
specific
argument
would
be
that
section
2
requires
the
creation
of
two
districts
in
north
carolina
because,
just
as
you
pointed
out,
one
could
be
done
in
that
part
of
the
state
and
the
other
in
the
other
part
of
the
state,
and
the
only
reason
that
they're
in
a
different
place
is
for
incumbency
protection
reasons,
and
that
latter
reason
has
nothing
to
do
with
race,
and
if
you
say
that
you
can't
do
that,
then
you're
saying
that
you
can't
do
it
when
black
districts
are
involved
but
you
could
do
it
when
white
districts
are
involved,
and
so
the
latter
proposition
is
an
impossible
one
to
maintain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
legally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
i
mean,
that's
the
specific
argument,
so
i'd
appreciate
your
addressing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
taking
that
as
a
position.
i'm
simply
asking
you
to
address
it
because
i
think
that's
the
specific
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
first
possibility
is,
it
isn't
true
that
they'd
be
in
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act.
that
would
be,
i
guess,
an
issue.
but
if
it
turns
out
that
they
would
have
been,
is
there
anything
wrong
with
their
having
drawn
the
boundaries
solely
for
incumbency
protection,
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what's
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
create
two
or
not?
what
about
this
map
1,
map
2,
and
map
3?
does
that
show
it,
or
not?
well,
i
mean,
if
you
don't
know,
don't
bother
answering
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just...
i
mean,
has
anybody
sat
down
and
done
it,
so
that
you
could
show
that
you
could
create
two
compact
majority
minority
districts
in
the
state,
or
majority
black
districts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
compact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
compact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
were
compact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
case
that
if,
in
fact,
those
criteria
are
met...
you
see,
what...
i
find
it
quite
difficult,
because
there's
a
constitutional
principle
that
you're
permitted
to
do
this
when
there's
a
compelling
need,
and
then
it
has
to
be
narrowly
tailored.
and
by
itself,
narrowly
tailored
might
suggest
compactness,
but
is
there
a
principle
involved
that,
if
it
is
compact,
and
you
insist
on
it,
then
only
black
related
districts
would
have
the
requirement
of
not
taking
into
account
protecting
incumbencies,
while
white
districts
would
not
have
such
a
requirement,
and
can
the
constitution
permit
such
a
result,
if
that's
right?
and
what
i
want
you
to
address,
if
you
can,
is
if
that's
right,
there's
a
constitutional
principle
each
way.
narrow
tailoring
cuts
in
favor
of
compactness,
but
the
basic
principle
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
would
seem
to
cut
in
the
opposite
direction,
so
how
can
those
be
reconciled?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
a
state
passed
a
law,
and
the
law
said,
we
can
use
incumbency
protection
as
a
principle
except
in
one
instance.
anyone
who's
elected
out
of
section
2
districts
and
who
is
black
can't
use
that
principle.
would
that
law
survive
constitutional
challenge?
