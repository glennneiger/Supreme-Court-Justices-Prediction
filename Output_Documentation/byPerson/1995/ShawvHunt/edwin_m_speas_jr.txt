mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
matter
first
came
to
this
court
on
the
granting
of
defendant's
rule
12(b)(6)
motion,
and
all
of
the
facts
of
the
complaint,
of
course,
were
presumed
to
be
true.
the
matter
was
remanded
to
court
for
trial,
to
the
district
court
for
trial,
and
at
the
trial,
extensive
evidence
was
taken
by
the
court.
among
that
evidence
were
specific
statements
by
legislators
and
the
drafters
of
the
map
that
they
intended
to
draw
the
12th
district
as
an
urban
district.
demographers
told
us
without
any
question
the
12th
district
is
an
urban
district.
it
is
the
most
urban
district
created
in
north
carolina.
historians
told
us
also
that
the
12th
district
is
located
within
the
piedmont
urban
crescent.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
the
12th
district
is
orange,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
it
is
located
entirely
within
the
10
counties
that
make
up
the
piedmont
urban
crescent,
an
area
that
the
historians
tell
us
has
historic
integrity.
the
historians
also...
excuse
me.
the
demographers
also
told
us
that
this
area
is
laced
together
by
interstate
highways,
that
the
district
is
accessible
both
for
voters
and
their
representatives.
all
of
these
factors
combined
to
lead
the
district
court
to
conclude
that
this
district
and
all
districts
provided
fair
and
effective
representation
for
north
carolina
citizens,
and
we
think
that's
very
important
in
this
case,
because,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
ultimate
purpose
of
redistricting
is
to
provide
fair
and
effective
representation
for
all
of
north
carolina's
citizens,
both
black
and
white.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
it
would
seem
to
us,
your
honor,
that
those
are
very
pertinent
issues
for...
the
issues
for
the
court
to
consider
in
regard
to
the
issues
in
front
of
you.
we
think--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--in
this
case,
the
evidence
was
presented
that
the
district
does
provide
fair
and
effective
representation,
and
the
district
court
found
that
it
does,
in
fact,
do
that,
so
we
think
it
is
important,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
but
we
think
in
this
case
that
the
issue
of
whether
the
district
provides
fair
and
effective
representation
is
relevant
to
the
issue
of
standing,
is
relevant
to
the
issue
of
whether
race
was
the
predominant
motive...
if
race
was
the
predominant
motive,
you
would
assume
that
the
district
might
not
provide
fair
and
effective
representation
for
white
citizens,
and
in
fact--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--but
it
was
fair
and
effective--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--we
get
it,
your
honor,
from
your
statements
that
the
purpose,
the
ultimate
purpose,
the
fundamental
purpose
of
redistricting
is
to
provide
fair
and
effective
representation.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
this
wasn't
done
in
the
abstract,
your
honor.
specific
evidence
was
presented
that
it
does
provide
fair
and
effective
representation.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
well,
certainly
we
do
believe
that
this
particular
plan
meets
strict
scrutiny.
we
also
believe
that
the
district
court
applied
a
too
lenient
test
to
determine
whether
this
was
a
racial
gerrymander
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
with
section
2
and
section
5,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
a
black
voter
would
have
had
standing
to
bring--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
i
believe
that
a
black
voter
in
north
carolina
would
have
had
standing--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--to
bring
a
section
2
claim
asserting
a
violation
of
section
2.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
the
question
under
a
section
2
case,
would
there
been,
have
been
the
potential
for
the
state
of
north
carolina
to
created,
to
have
created
a
geographically
compact
district
to...
that
would
have--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
issue
for
the
state
is
whether
such
a
district
can
be
drawn.
if
it
is
established,
and
there
is
strong
evidence
for
believing
that
a
district
can
be
drawn,
then
principles
of
federalism
and
the
discretion
the
states
must
have
in
this
area
give
to
the
states
discretion
as
to
where
they
will
place
that
district--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--so
long
as
it
provides
fair
and
effective
representation.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
in
this
case
the
evidence
is,
and
certainly
the
district
court
found,
that
there
was
racially
polarized
voting
within
this
particular
area,
or
these
areas
where
these
districts
were
created,
so
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
a
fit
between
these
particular
districts
and
the
section
2--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
and
certainly
there's
no
question,
it's
unrefuted
in
this
case,
that
black
citizens
vote
together
cohesively.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
many
different
districts
were
presented
to
the
north
carolina
general
assembly.
some
were
here,
in
the
southeast,
where
there's
some
concentration
of
black
citizens,
some
were
here,
in
the
northeast,
where
there
is
a
concentration
of
black
citizens--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--and
some
were
here.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
i
would
cite
you
shaw
i,
shaw
i,
ii,
and
iii,
to
begin
with.
that
is
a
district
where,
if
you
add
blacks
and
indians,
you
do
have
a
majority
minority
district.
i
would
cite
to
you--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--i
would
cite
to
you
the
plan
prepared
and
presented
by
representative
larry
justus,
which
was
labeled
compact
2,
which
i
believe
creates,
and
was
presented
in
january
of
1992
to
the
general
assembly,
which
is
contained...
a
map
of
which
is
contained
in
the
maps
lodged
with
the
court,
and
i
will
obtain
those.
i
would
cite
to
you
a
district
running
from
winston
salem
to
halifax
county
that
was
before
the
general
assembly
that
was
a
majority
black
district,
and
that
was
described
in
the
state's
response
to
the
department
of
justice
as
a
reasonably
compact--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
that
any
individual
put
before
the
general
assembly
at
a
time--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--a
plan
that
had
two
districts--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
legislators
believed
that
could
be
done.
there
is
in
the
record
of
this
case--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--well,
yes,
your
honor.
at
page
155
of
the
joint
appendix
is
an
article
which
recounts
a
private
meeting
of
north
carolina
democratic
legislative
leaders
at
which...
and
congressmen,
at
which
they
conclude
that
yes,
two
districts
can
be
drawn.
this
was,
of
course,
just
2
days...
or
2
weeks
before
the
plan
itself
was
enacted.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
two
districts
that
can
be
drawn,
i
believe
is
the
thrust
of
their
statements,
that
some
people--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--would
perceive
to
be--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--of
course,
your
honor,
to
a
large
extent,
compactness
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
there
are...
there
were
numerous
plans
presented
to
the
general
assembly--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--fact.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
which
included
two
majority
minority
districts.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
in
several
of
the
plans,
one
of
the
districts
was
compact
to
the
eye,
and
the
others,
the
district
might
not
have
been
compact
to
the
eye,
but
all
together--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--i
understand...
i
understand.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
i
understand
the
distinction
you're
making.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
no.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
we
take
that
position--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--charlotte,
of
course,
was
coincident.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
virtually
all
of
these
districts
in
charlotte
and
gastonia
are
a
large
part
of--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--my
answer
is
that
it
is
within
the
state's
discretion
once
it
has
a
basis
to
believe
that
a
section
2
violation
could
be
established,
to
determine
where
to
place
the
district.
that
discretion
is
not
without
limits.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
no.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there
are,
obviously,
limits
on
the
state's
discretion
in
determining
where
to
place
the
district.
the
two
most
obvious
are
first,
your
honor,
that
there
must
be
some
racially
polarized
voting
within
the
area
in
which
you
locate
the
district,
and
i
believe
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
racially
polarized
voting
throughout
north
carolina,
including
the
area
encompassed
within
the
12th
district,
and
because,
your
honor,
i
believe
narrow
tailoring
includes,
and
perhaps
most
importantly
includes,
a
requirement
that
the
harm
to
innocent
third
parties
be
minimized,
i
believe
that
fair
and
effective
representation
is
a
limit
on
the
discretion
of
the
state.
you
must--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--my
understanding
of
your
prior
decisions
is
that
the
existence
of
harm,
of
some
harm
to
innocent
third
parties
as
a
consequence
of
the
action
taken
to
remedy
a
discrimination
is
an
important
element
of
narrow
tailoring.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
evidence
in
this
case
establishes
that
the
12th
district
provides,
and
the
court
found,
fair
and
effective
representation
for
all
citizens.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
a
harm--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--a
harm
to
an
innocent
third
party
could
be
denial
of
accessibility
between
them
and
their
representatives.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
this
district
doesn't
do
that.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
this
12th
district,
for
example,
provides
fair
and
effective
representation
for
black
voters,
obviously.
it
also
provides
fair
and
effective
representation
for
all
voters,
both
black
and
white,
because
it's
an
urban
district.
it
provides
fair
and
effective
representation
for
all
voters,
both
black
and
white,
because
it's
located
within
an
area
of
the
state
that
geography--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--it
was
certainly
our
understanding,
and
the
district
court
found,
that
an
element
of
narrow
tailoring
is
whether
there's
harm
to
innocent
third
parties.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
this
district--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--the
harm
to
black
citizens,
your
honor,
is
the
dilution
of
their
votes,
the
racially
polarized
voting.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that's
the
consequence
of--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--your
honor,
there...
you...
i
believe
there
is
coincidence
between
the
harms
and
north--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--all
north
carolina
black
citizens
have
been
the
victims
of
racially
polarized
voting.
i
believe
that's
the
evidence
in
this
case,
and
the
state
cannot--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--it
would...
the
group
of
voters
within
the
district
where
the
racially
polarized
voting
exists
would
be--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--would
be...
receive
the
benefit
of
the
ameliorative
black
vot--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--it
is--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--vote
dilution
through
racially
polarized
voting
is--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--the
evidence
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
significant
concentrations
of
black
citizens
in
this
district.
they
reside
within
each
of--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--our
first
position
is,
the
district
is
not
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
the
district
court
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
this
decision,
of
this
court's
decision
in
miller
when
it
decided
this
case.
it
applied
a
test
that's
too
lenient.
it
said,
the
test
is
whether
race
was
one
of
several
substantial
and
motivating
factors
in
the
local
redistricting
process.
the
evidence
in
this
case,
and
the
district
court
found,
that
race
was
used
in
combination
with
five
other
factors.
the
district
court
found
in
this
case
that
the
desire
to
create
a
homogeneous
district
was
one
factor
given
primacy,
and
i
think
it's
important
the
court
examine--
mr.
edwin
m.
speas,
jr.
--thank
you.
