justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
a
person
who
has
a
right
to
challenge
one
district
by
reason
of
residence
in
that
district
has
a
right
to
challenge
the
entire
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
argument
from
the
ripple
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
the
aspects
of
the
plan
that
you
claim
are
invalid
with
respect
to
other
districts.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they're
not.
i
mean,
the
one
goes
to
intent
and
the
other
goes
to
the
pure
fact
of
whether
it
was
necessary,
not
whether
it
was
intended.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they're
not
inconsistent.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
can
prove
that
it
was
indeed
necessary,
that
there's
no
other
thing
you
could
have
done...
i
think
that's
a
hard
thing
to
prove,
but...
that
no
other
configuration
could
possibly
have
been
adopted
which
would
comply
with
section
2,
i
suppose
if
they
can
prove
that,
it's
certainly
not
inconsistent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
the
fact
that
they
intended
to
do
section
5.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
argument,
though.
but
you're...
so
you're
saying
that
the
only
justification
at
this
stage
is
the
justification
of
their
original
intent,
and
we've
now...
this
court
has
found
that
that
intent,
i.e.
conform
to...
get
section
5
preclearance
is
inadequate,
so
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
everett,
i
haven't
understood
everything
you've
been
saying...
if
your
answer
to
that
isn't
a
clear
yes,
i
don't
know
what
you've
been
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you've
been
saying
the
motivation
cannot
be
racial.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
i
set
out
to
create
two
majority
minority
districts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
end
of
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
would
you--
--why--
--no,
please.
i
don't
know
why
that
would
be.
i
mean,
if
you
buy
the
proposition
of
racial
entitlement,
that
is,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
a
particular
black
man
has
been
discriminated
against,
that
the
object
is
the
race
as
a
whole
has
to
be
made
good,
why
wouldn't
that
follow?
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
part
of
the
state
you're
not
properly
creating
the
black
district
in,
so
long
as
you
create
a
black
district
somewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
a
racial
entitlement
theory.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
particular
individuals
who
are
being
disadvantaged.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
the
point
would
be
that
they
would
not
be
drawing
it
solely
on
the
basis
of
incumbency
protection.
they'd
be...
still
be
drawing
the
boundaries
on
the
basis
of
race,
although
in
order
to
protect
incumbents.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
still
be
racial
boundary
drawing,
and
your
position
is
that's
okay
when
you're
doing
it
in
order
to
comply
with
section
2,
but
it's
not
okay
when
you're
doing
it
to
protect
incumbents,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
a
district
court
is
supposed
to
sit
in
judgment
of,
of
whether
a
particular
redistricting
scheme
provides
fair
and
effective
representation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
a
nice
thing,
who
could
be
against
it,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
have
to...
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
judges
and
lawyers
are
good
at
doing?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
so,
maybe
not.
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
correlation
between
the
two.
i...
you
know,
i
suppose
if
we
wanted
to
go
to
a
system
in
which
everybody
is
represented
by
his
race,
i
guess
that
might
be
fair
and
effective
representation.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
do
you
get
this
test?
i
mean,
i
don't
see
it
in
any
of
our
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course
it
is,
and
there
are
certain
subrules
that
we
follow
and
apply
to
determine
whether
that's
been
done,
but
we
just
don't
sit
in
the
abstract
and
decide
whether
there's
fair
and
effective
representation.
justice
antonin
scalia
two
districts...
is
there
not
just
unrefuted
evidence,
is
there
any
evidence
that
two
compact
black
districts,
black
majority,
not
minority
majority,
but
black
majority
districts
could
have
been
created?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
two--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
two
have
been
created?
is
there
testimony
and
evidence,
and
i'd
like
you
to
cite
it
to
me,
because
your
opponent
contends
not,
that
you
could
have
had
a
justification
for
creating
one
majority
black
and
one
majority
minority,
but
that
there
is
no
justification
on
the
gingles
standards,
even
if
you're
not
going
to
use
the
gingles
standards
in
the
districts
where
you
apply
them,
for
two
black
majority
districts.
now,
what
would
you
cite
me
as
refuting
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
two
black
majority,
not
majority
minority.
i
want
two
majority
black
districts,
compact.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
these
plans
had
two
black
districts.
i
mean,
obviously
a
lot
of
different
plans
can
have
one
majority
black
district,
but
these
plans
you're
referring
me
to
had
two
majority
black
districts,
compact
majority
black
districts.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
the
whole
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
create
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
could
create
one
here,
or
you
could
create
one
somewhere
else,
but
is
there
any
evidence
that
you
could
create
two
simultaneously
majority
black,
which
is
what
your
remedy
proposes
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
have
to
be
right.
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
case
that
they
were
right
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
been
done.
the
issue
is
whether
two
compact
districts
can
be
created,
which
is
what
would
create...
which
would...
what
would
produce
an
alleged
section
2
violation
if
you
didn't
create
two
black
districts,
but
you...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
do
step
one,
which
is,
under
gingles...
gingles,
whatever
you
want
to
say
it,
that
there
have
to
be
two
creatable,
compact
black
majority
districts.
justice
antonin
scalia
majority
black
is
what
we're
talking
about,
not
just
majority
minority...
majority
black.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
last
time
you
said
majority
minority.
i
don't
think
you
meant
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
now,
wait.
you
would
say
there's
no
harm
to
a
racial
group
if
they're
made
to
ride
in
a
separate
railroad
car,
so
long
as
it's
just
as
nice
as
the
railroad
car
in
which
other
people
are
made
to
ride?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
harm
to
fair
and
effective
transportation,
or
schooling,
if
they're
made
to
go
to
a
separate
school?
no
harm
to
fair
and
effective
legislation?
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
the
same
argument.
there's
no
harm
to
fair
and
effective
representation.
but
i've
been
excluded
from
my
district
because
of
my
race,
the
individual
says,
and
that
shouldn't
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
speas--
--wait
a
minute,
is
racially
polarized
voting
a
constitutional
violation?
does
somebody
who
votes
on
the
basis
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--race
commit
a
constitutional
violation?
i
didn't
realize
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
so
the
constitutional
harm
is
having
a
concentrated
number
of
persons
of
a
certain
race
which
has
been
denied...
which
has
been
denied
representation.
it
seems
to
me
the
harm
assumed
by
gingles
gingles
is
within
the
district
that
could
have
been
made
a
voting
district
but
has
not
been.
that's
the
harm.
it's
not
the
fact
that
somebody
engages
in
racial
voting.
that's
regrettable,
but
it's
not
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
chambers,
many
people
think
that
black
people
can
have
a
greater
voice
when
they
are
close
to
a
majority,
or
at
least
a
substantial
minority
in
a
lot
of
districts,
rather
than
a
majority
in
one
or
two
districts.
indeed,
the
charge
is
made
that
it
is
very
much
in
the
political
interests
of
some
people
to
aggregate
all
blacks
into
one
or
two
districts
so
that
the
rest
of
the
districts
can
ignore
their
interests.
i
don't...
you
know,
i
am
in
total
sympathy
with
the
objective
that
you're
urging
upon
us,
but
it
certainly
isn't
clear
as
a
matter
of
principle
or
logic
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
achieve
that
objective.
indeed,
there
are
many
who
think
that
this
is
moving
in
precisely
the
wrong
direction,
that
its
net
effect
is
to
reduce
the
opportunity
of
blacks
to
have
their
interests
taken
into
account.
i
frankly
don't
know
what
the
answer
is,
but
i
certainly
can't
agree
with
you
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
achieve
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean,
you
couldn't
elect
a
candidate
of
choice?
is
it
clear
that
the
candidate
you
elected
ignored
the
interests
of
black
people,
or
is
it
just
that
he
was
not
black?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bender,
what
are
the
two
districts,
the
two
gingles
gingles
concentrated
districts
that
you
rely
on
for
this
compulsion?
two
at
the
same
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
two
in
different
programs.
justice
antonin
scalia
yet
that
is
what
this
strange
configuration--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
intended
to
create,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
degree
of
departure
from
normal
districting
principles
was
not
necessary
to
comply
with
what
you
say
section
2
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
have
had
a
much
more
concentrated
second
district
if
you
were
only
going
for
majority
minority,
but
instead,
the
state
chose
to
go
for
two
majority
black
districts
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
no
one
has
given
us
any
indication
of
why
the
failure
to
have
a
second
majority
black
district
could
possibly
have
been
a
section
2
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
the
community
of
interest
here
is
what,
that
they're
all
black?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
figuring
it
out--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
they
take
into
account
minority,
or
did
they
punch
into
the
computer
just
black?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
in
figuring
out
this
strange
scheme.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
impression
is
that
they
punched
in...
that
they
punched
in
black,
that
they
were
looking
specifically
for
two
majority
black
districts,
and
there
is
no
justification
that
anyone
has
asserted
under
section
2
for
punching
that
into
the
computer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
other
minorities
that
form
the
almost
majority
in
the
concentrated
district
that
was
identified
but
not
used?
what
about
them?
they
were
what,
hispanic
and
indian?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
you
said
you
formed,
you
know,
49
point
some
odd
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
almost
a
majority,
though
not
even
a
majority,
much
less
a
majority
black,
but
you
formed
that
out
of
a
district
in
which
only
42
percent
were
black.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
xx--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
theory
is
that
hispanics
and
indians
in
that
concentrated
district,
their
interests
will
be
well
enough
taken
care
of
by
the
all
black
district
in
the
northern
part
of
the
city.
