the
court's
opinion,
mr.
everett.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
court's
opinion,
not
my
opinion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that...
would
you
take
that
position
even
in
circumstances
in
which
to
accomplish
the
goal,
the
legislature
did
not
resort
to
drawing
the
lines
on
the
basis
of
race,
but
rather
on
the
basis
of
voter
registration?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
their
goal
was
admittedly
to
get
a
majority
minority
district,
but
to
achieve
it
they
put
in
the
computer
program
data
about
voter
registration,
democrat,
republican,
independent,
and
they
drew
the
districts
on
that
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
say
that
cannot
be
done
even
if
the
boundaries
are
drawn
on
the
basis
of
voter
registration?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
get
a
computer
program
to
draw
the
boundaries,
and
you
plug
into
the
computer
how
the
voters
are
registered,
democrat,
republican,
independent,
dixiecrat,
whatever
it
might
be,
and
the
lines
are
drawn
on
that
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
goal
was
to
create
a
majority
minority
district,
but
it
is
accomplished
by
using
nonracial
data.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
take
the
position
that
if
strict
scrutiny
is
applied,
it's
fatal
in
fact,
necessarily,
that
nothing
survives
strict
scrutiny.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
had--
--what
about
a
case
where...
i'm
sorry.
i
had
thought
that
we
had
indicated
that
it
is
possible
to
survive
strict
scrutiny
if
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
and
if
the
plan
is
narrowly
tailored.
i
had
thought
that's
what
this
court
had
said,
but
you're
arguing
for
something
else,
it
sounds
like.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
compliance
with
section
2
could
not
be
a
compelling
state
interest,
or
it
could?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought
it
was
remanded
to
apply
strict
scrutiny,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
that's
relevant.
i
thought
the
court
below
had
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
compelling
state
interest
and
whether
it
was
narrowly
tailored,
and
i'm
surprised
you're
not
talking
about
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
we're
back
to
that
same
peculiar
test,
and
i
don't
know
what
it
has
to
do
with
narrow
tailoring.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
assuming
that
it
can
be
shown
that
the
gingles
factors
are
met
to
establish
a
section
2
violation,
and
that
there
is
an
area
in
the
state
where
there
is
a
reasonably
compact
block
of
black
voters
that
could
be
combined
in
a
district
and
where
there
is
evidence
of
racially
polarized
voting,
or
block
voting,
so
that
you
could
create
a
district
there,
then
gingles
would
suggest
that's
what
you
look
at
to
see
if
there's
a
section
2
violation.
now,
if
you
establish
that,
can
the
remedy
be
to
create
a
district
in
a
different
part
of
the
state,
not
where
the
evidence
showed
at
all
that
would
satisfy
gingles,
but
go
to
a
completely
different
part
of
the
state
and
create
something
there?
is
that
a
narrowly
tailored
remedy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
could--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--just
in
general
could
you
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
problem...
the
problem,
of
course,
is
the
fourteen
amendment
and
its
prohibition
that
the
state
not
act
on
the
basis
of
race
alone
in
handing
out
public
benefits,
or
in
drawing
district
lines,
or
whatever
it
is.
i
mean,
that's
why
we're
into
this,
and
that's...
it
doesn't
talk
about
farmers,
it
talks
about
race,
doesn't
it?
