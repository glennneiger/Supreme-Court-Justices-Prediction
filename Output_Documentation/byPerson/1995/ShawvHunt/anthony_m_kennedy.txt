justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
to
take
that
position
to
prevail
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
you
secondary
position
with
respect
to
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
compelling
interest
that
the
district
court
found?
was
it
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
section
2?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now,
with
respect
to
section
2,
in
district
12,
i
take
it
that
the
westernmost
part
is
gaston
county,
am
i
correct
in
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
before
this
district
was
drawn,
would
the
black
voters
in
western...
that
western
part
in
gaston
county
have
had
standing
to
bring
a
section
2
vote
dilution
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
you
think
that
there
was...
that
they
were
then
in
a
district
which
was
compact--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
contiguous
under
the
gingles
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
no,
based
on...
based
on
the
voters
in
gaston
county
being
unrepresented
in
a
black
district.
how
would
the
gingles
requirements
comply
with,
with
reference
to
those
voters,
just
assuming
initially
a
section
2
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
necessarily
fail
that,
don't
they?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
then
the
remedy
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
initial
violation.
that's
a
very
strange
doctrine
of
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
must
also
find,
under
gingles
at
least,
that
the
other
factors
are
present.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
can't
just
talk
about
racial
polarizing.
you
have
to
talk
about
compact
and
cohesive
districts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--how
does
that
comport
with
narrow
tailoring?
i
thought
narrow
tailoring
meant,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
because
we've
used
it
in
slightly
different
formulations
in
different
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
that
narrow
tailoring
meant
that
there
is
a
wrong,
and
that
the
remedy
has
to
be
as
closely
designed
to
cure
that
evil
as
possible,
and
what
you're
telling
me
now
is
that
once
you
find
that
there's
a
violation,
you
can
adopt
any
remedy
you
want--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that
seems
to
me
quite
the
polar
opposite
of
narrow
tailoring.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
harm
to
innocent
third
parties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
would
comprehend
exclusion
of
whites
from
a
district
because
of
their
race.
that's
harm
to
an
innocent
third
party,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
what
harm,
an
example
of
harm
to
an
innocent
third
party
is
in
the
context
of
redistricting.
i
take
it,
it's
the
exclusion
of
some
people
by
reason
of
their
race
from
a
different...
from
a
district
that
they
otherwise
would
be
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
has
ties
to
their
community
and
to
their
former
district.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
don't
they
have
to
show
the
gingles
factors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
can
examine
that
later,
but
let
me
ask
you,
are
you
trying
to
suggest,
or
are
you
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
gingles
factors
have
been
overemphasized--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
unimportant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
see,
what...
where
we
are,
mr.
chambers...
as
you
know
this
as
well
or
better
than
i,
two
very
volatile
areas,
race
and
politics,
in
which
there
has
been
no
long
tradition
or
settled
juridical
principles
about
what
are
neutral,
fair,
adequate
districting
considerations.
it's
been
the
law
of
the
jungle.
and
the
point
of
gingles
was
to
try
to
introduce
some
neutral,
controlled
factors
that
could
be
the
beginning
point
for
building
a
principles
jurisprudence,
and
i'm
somewhat
concerned
that
you
suggest
that
we
somehow
now
sweep
those
under
the
rug
and
put
us
back
in
the
anything
goes
area.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
leads
us
just
to
proportional
representation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
quite
apart
from
the
section
2,
which
points
in
these
different
directions,
quite
apart
from
there,
it
seems
to
me
proportional
representation
is
the
last
thing
that
you
should
argue
for--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
it's
ultimately
very,
very
dangerous
and
divisive.
