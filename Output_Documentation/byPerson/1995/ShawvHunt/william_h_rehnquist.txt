proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
who
you'd
get
it
from.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
everett,
there
is
some
difference,
isn't
there,
with
respect
to
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
with
respect
to
one
district
and
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
we
don't
accept
the
ripple
effect,
there
is
some
difference,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose--
--what
about
our
decision
in
hays?
i
mean,
couldn't
the
plaintiffs
there
have
made
the
same
argument
about
louisiana,
that
it's
a
seamless
web,
and
we
didn't
accept
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
classification
on
the
basis
of
gender
has
not
been
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
in
the
past.
it's
been
subject
to
a
kind
of
intermediate
or
quasi
strict
scrutiny.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
everett.
mr.
farr,
we'll...
i
think
we'll
recess
and
resume
at
1:00
p.m.--
mr.
farr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
can
be
a
compelling
state
interest
in
some
cases,
why
isn't
it
in
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
mr.
speas,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
color
is
the
12th
district
on
the
map?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
test
that
every
redistricting
plan
and
every
state
must
meet,
that
the
particular
district
provides
fair
and
effective
representation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
two
districts
can
be
drawn
in
the
sense
of,
we
can
legislate
them,
or
two
districts
can
be
drawn
under
the
gingles
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
finished
the
answer
to
the
question,
mr.
speas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chambers,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chambers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bender,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
justice
breyer's
question
asked
you
about
the
creation
of
a
white
district.
would
that
be
constitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
the
case
is
submitted.
