how
about
a
voluntary
majority
minority
district?
i
think
you
said
you
were
about
to
say
something
some
people
would
consider
outlandish.
are
you
saying
that,
that
if
the
avowed
purpose
is
to
create
a
majority
minority
district
no
matter
how
compact
it
is,
if
people
are
honest
about
that's
what
they're
trying
to
accomplish,
that
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
that
there
are
many
congressional
districts,
many
state
districts
across
the
country
where
people
said
exactly
that,
we
want
a
majority
minority
district,
so
on
your
reasoning,
a
good
deal
of
the
redistricting
was
unconstitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
it
legitimate
or
not?
well,
why
isn't
it?
justice

mr.
speas,
your
answers
to
the
questions
that
is
part
2
of
your
argument
seem
to
be
colored
by
what
is
your
main
position,
which
you
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
state.
i
think
you
said
that
despite
shaw
i
the
district
court
did
not
have
to
go
right
into
the
strict
scrutiny
compelling
state
interest
mold.
your
first
argument
seemed
to
be
that
race
didn't
predominate,
and
my
question
to
you
is,
if
it
didn't,
what
did?
your
main
argument
is
not
this
section
2,
so
maybe
in
the
time
remaining
you
have
an
opportunity
to
say
what
is
your
main
position
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
not?
