justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
everett,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
do
you
find
something
legally
or
constitutionally
inconsistent
with
the
position
the
last
time
around,
or
at
least
the
assumption
the
last
time
around
that
the
reason
for
the
configuration
was
to
obtain
section
5
preclearance
and
the
reason
found
here...
strike
the
word
reason...
and
the
fact
found
here
that
in
fact
the
configuration
was
a
means
to
comply
with
section
2?
are
those
two
inconsistent?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
asking
you
whether
they're
inconsistent.
justice
david
h.
souter
one
says
the
motive...
the
motive
the
first
time
was
to
obtain
section
5
preclearance,
period.
assume
that.
i'm
assuming
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
finding
now
is
that
that
configuration
was
necessary
and
hence
justifiable
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation.
are
those
two
propositions
inconsistent
legally?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
wasn't
whether
they
had
two
different
intents.
my
question
was,
if
we
assume
that
the
intent
was
in
fact
to
get
a
section
5
preclearance,
and
we
know
from
shaw
that
that
is
not
adequate,
is
there
anything
inconsistent
with
saying
it
is
nonetheless
justifiable
now,
because
in
fact
it
was
necessary
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation
and
hence--
justice
david
h.
souter
--can
be
upheld.
are
those
two
propositions
inconsistent?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
must
pursue
that
for
a
moment.
assume...
i'm
not
asking
you
to
assume
it's
true
in
this
case,
but
just
assume
that
it
is,
in
fact,
reasonably
necessary
to
conform
to
section
2,
are
we
supposed
to
ignore,
or
is
a
three
judge
district
court
supposed
to
ignore
that
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
the
case
goes
back.
the
court
says,
unconstitutional.
go
back
and
come
up
with
a
new
plan.
they
go
back,
and
they
conclude,
we'll
assume
again
not
necessarily
in
this
case,
but
we'll
assume
in
the
hypo
that
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation.
so
they
redraw
the
map,
and
it
looks
like
the
last
map.
new
case.
may
the
section
2
violation
be
considered
by
the
three
judge...
may
the
claim
that
it
is
reasonably
necessary
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation
be
considered
by
the
three
judge
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
want
you
to
answer
my
hypo.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'm
not
suggesting
to
you
that
my
hypo
is
this
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i'm
not
asking
you
to
concede
that,
but
on
my
hypo,
may
the
three
judge
district
court
consider
the
defense,
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way,
that
this
is
reasonably
necessary
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
goes
to
the,
sort
of
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
may
they,
just
as
a
general
proposition,
consider
it
as
a
defensive
matter
that
it
is
reasonably
necessary
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it
isn't,
but
maybe...
and
that
then
may
lead
you
to
claim
that
section
2
is
unconstitutional,
or
whatever,
but
is
it
relevant
as
a
defense?
may
the
court
consider
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
wasn't
my
question.
may
the
court
consider
it
as
an
appropriate
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
are
you
saying,
then,
that
a...
that
the
object
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation
as
a
matter
of
law
may
not
be
considered
as
a
justification
under
strict
scrutiny?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
reason
for
your
answer
essentially
that
section
2
is
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
not
be
a...
and
no,
i
don't
think
anybody
is
claiming
that
it's
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
but
it
is
a
relevant
consideration,
as
i
understand
it,
under
miller,
in
determining
the
extent
to
which
race
predominates,
because
one
of
the
things
you
ask,
the
principal
question
you
asked,
i
guess,
is,
has
race
subordinated
traditional
districting
principles?
now,
if
one
districting
principle
is
incumbency
protection,
if
that
as
a
matter
of
historical
fact
is
true,
that
that
has
been
an
object
pursued
over
the
years,
and
if
that
can
be
pursued,
let's
say
with
political
data
as
opposed
to
racial
data
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
surrogate
for
political
data,
if
it's
pursued
with
political
data
alone,
then
do
you
not
concede
that
the
boundary
can
vary
from
the
compact
boundary
that
would
satisfy
gingles
without
flunking
the
narrow
tailoring
test?
don't
you
concede
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
tell
me
why
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
are
saying
not
that
the
remedy
must
go
to
the
people
who
have
been
injured,
but
that
the
remedy
must
go
to
all
and
only
the
people
injured,
and
no
other
consideration
may
play
a
role--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
if
you
are
saying
that,
i
think,
you
are
asking
the
court
to
depart
at
least
in
one
respect
from
miller,
because
miller
says
a
consideration
as
to
whether
race
has
subordinated,
whether
race
is
predominant,
is,
has
race
subordinated
traditional
districting
principles,
and
if
a
traditional
districting
principle
is
incumbency
protection,
you
are
saying,
well,
you've
got
to
modify
miller
to
the
extent
that
incumbency
protection
will
never
be
cognizable
here,
so
i
think
you're
asking
for
a
change
in
miller.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
not?
if...
and
my
assumption
is
incumbency
protection
can
be
shown
historically
to
have
been
a
districting
objective.
it's
one
of
the
things
that's
considered.
if
that
is
true,
that
historically
that
has
been
an
objective
pursued,
and
you're
now
saying
no,
you
can't
pursue
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
that
would
modify
the
boundary--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
to
that
extent
you're
modifying
miller.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask...
oh,
i'm
sorry,
are
you
still
answering
justice
breyer's
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question.
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
a
given
majority
minority
district
can
be
created
so
that
the
gingles...
subject
to
the
gingles
criteria,
that
then,
in
pursuit
of
other
districting
objectives,
a
majority
minority
district
can
be
created
somewhere
else
in
the
state
that
is
in
no
way
coincident
with
the
compact
gingles
district?
do
you
take
that
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
overlap
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
merely
the
case
that
you
can
modify
around
the
edges,
move
to
the
right,
move
to
the
left
a
bit
here
and
there,
in
order
to
obtain
other
objectives.
you
can
go
to
an
entirely
different
part
of
the
state
and
have
a
district
which
is
in
no
way
geographically
coincident
with
the
one
that
would...
you
use
to
satisfy
the
gingles
condition.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's...
your
answer
is
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
answer
is
yes
to
my
question,
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
shouldn't
it
also
be
an
element
of
narrow
tailoring
whether
there
is
any
amelioration
to
the
black
voters
who
were
the
subject
of
the
gingles
qualifying
analysis
in
the
first
place?
apparently,
they
are
ignored.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
on
your
theory,
they
can
be
ignored,
because
you
said
you
can
put
the
district
anywhere
else
in
the
state,
and
it
need
not
in
any
way
be
coincident
with,
we'll
call
it
the
gingles
qualifying
district,
which
allows
you
to
do
this
in
the
first
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
those
whose
votes
were
diluted
and
subject
to
a
gingles
remedy
on
your
analysis
can
be
ignored
entirely.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
take
the
position
that
there's
at
least
got
to
be
some
coincidence
between
the
ultimate
majority
minority
district
and
the
gingles
district,
which
allows
you
to
do
this
in
the
first
place?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
there's
no
coincidence
of
the
actual
voters
in
what
i
will
call
the
gingles
district
and
the
ultimate
resulting
district
on
your
theory.
there
need
not
be
any
coincidence
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
position
is
a
kind
of
racial
entitlement
theory,
as
opposed
to
individual
group
of
voters
entitlement
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
any
district
in
which
racially--
justice
david
h.
souter
do
those
principles--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
those
principles
have
to
be
historically
justified?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
urban
with
urban,
rural
with
rural?
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
you
refer
to
traditional
principles,
and
wasn't...
i
assume
the
reason
we
did
so
was
that
we
assume
the...
if
there
is
tradition
behind
the
principles,
they
are
less
manipulable--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
come
out...
yes.
