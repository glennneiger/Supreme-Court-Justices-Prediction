maybe
the
release
is
unenforceable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
more
basic
question?
can
we
assume
some
trans...
i
know
you
take
the
position
that
requirement
of
the
release
is
not
requiring
a
prohibited
transaction,
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--now,
supposing
the
amendment
did
require
compliance...
performance
of
a
prohibited
transaction.
would
it
be
permissible
to
make
the
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
your
position...
i
want
to
be
sure.
your
position
is
the
same
as
the
government's,
except
you
take
the
position
that
performing
the
amendment
would
not
be
a
prohibited
transaction,
whereas
they
say
it
would
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no
matter
what
the
condition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
matter
what
the
condition,
even
if
the
condition
was
that
the
beneficiary
must
agree
that
he
won't
rent
his
house
to
a
certain
class
of
persons,
or
something,
something
totally
unrelated
to
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
your
view
is
that
nothing
that
the
pension
plan
authorizes
can
be
a
prohibited
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
actually
pay
enhanced
benefits
for
services.
they're
paying
enhanced
benefits
for
retirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
they
make
the
payment,
the
person
is
no
longer
an
employee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
promise
of
benefits
attracts
the
employee,
but
not
the
payment
itself,
because
at
the
time
the
payment
is
made
the
person
is
a
former
employee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
it's
a
disability
benefit,
and
then
they're
paid
when
they're
not
working.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
promise
isn't
covered
by
406(d).
it's...
the
payment
is
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
your
pledge
examples
are
all
fit
within
the
word
transfer,
but
the
promise
of
future
benefits
doesn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
the
portion
of
section
406...
404
on
which
you
rely
is
quoted
in
any
of
the
papers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
know
where?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
place
particular
reliance
on
404,
that's
why--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
argument
applies
equally
to
a
provision
in
the
original
plan
or
to
an
amendment
after
the
plan's
been
in
effect
for
a
while.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
does,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't--
--i'm
surprised
you
say
it's
more
difficult.
i
don't
see
why,
if
the
provision
is
unlawful,
why
it's
only
unlawful
if
it's
an
amendment,
whereas
it
would
not
be
unlawful
in
the
original
document.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
have
trouble
understanding
why
that
is
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the...
even
if
it
were
in
the
original
instrument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's
your
argument.
i
may
have
missed
something.
