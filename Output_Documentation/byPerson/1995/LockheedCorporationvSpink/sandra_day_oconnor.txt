justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
krischer,
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
something
in
regard
to
the
first
question?
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
you
asked
whether
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
held
that
a
pension
plan
sponsor
can
be
liable
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
under
erisa
when
it
amended
the
plan.
then,
in
the
merits
brief
you
say
when
the
pension
plan
sponsor
and
plan
fiduciaries
may
be
held
liable,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
you
appear
to
be
raising
some
additional
questions
in
the
merits
brief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
solicitor
general's
brief
suggests
there
may
be
substantial
differences
in
answers
to
the
two
questions,
and
i
just
wondered
whether
we
should
confine
ourselves
to
what
you
raised
in
the
original
cert
position--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
look
to
whether
the
plan
sponsor
was
acting
in
a
fiduciary--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
does
that
language
in
406
cover,
then,
when
it
says
that
you
can't
pay
it
to
a
party
in
interest,
you
can't...
you
can't
transfer
to
or
use
by
or
for
the
benefit
of
a
party
in
interest
any
assets
of
the
plan.
what
does
that
apply
to?
