justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pursuant
to
the
lawful
terms--
--there
are
two
different
things
that
are
going
on
here.
one
is,
there's
the
distinction
between
acting
as
a
fiduciary
and
making
the
payment,
acting
as
a
settlor
and
making
the...
forgetting
that
distinction
for
a
moment,
and
turning
to
the
language
of
406(a)(d),
why
isn't
this
a
transfer
for
the
benefit
of
a
party
in
interest?
i
take
it
that's
what
we're...
i
take
it
that's
the
statutory
phrase
that
we're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
isn't
this
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer,
and
when
you're
answering
that,
distinguish
this
hypothetical.
suppose
the
employer
said,
you
may
take
early
retirement,
you
may
get
an
enhanced
benefit,
if
you
lend
us
back
the
money
at
3
percent
for
10
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
would
you
answer--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
second
half
of
his
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but,
can
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
a
violation
of
this
section?
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
it
for
the
benefit
of
a
party
in
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it,
in
your
view,
that
this
is
a
lawful
amendment
of
the
plan?
why
does
the
language
does
not
apply
here?
what
is
the
test
that
you're
proposing,
the
rule
that
we're
to
follow?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
beyond
that,
why
does
40...
i
take
it
beyond
that
you
agree
with
lockheed
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
permitted
for
the
plan
to
require
that
the
employee
who
is
receiving
severance
benefits
and
payments
from
the
plan
release
the
plan
from
all
further
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
is
permitted.
