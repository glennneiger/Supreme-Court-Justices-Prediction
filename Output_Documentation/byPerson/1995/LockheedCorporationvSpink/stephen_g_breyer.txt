mr.
krischer--
--what
is--
--i'm
sorry.
what
is
the
normal
trust
law?
i
set
up
a
trust,
14
grandchildren,
i'm
the
settlor,
$1,000
a
month
to
each.
i
amend
it,
as
i
reserve
the
power
to
do,
give
$4,000
to
mary
provided
mary
gives
me
her
apartment
in
palm
beach.
can
the...
is
that
under
ordinary
trust
law,
the
fiduciary
can
carry
that
out
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no,
i
mean,
it...
assume
normal--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
in
other
words,
you're
saying
under
erisa
they
can
say,
give
away
the
entire
corpus,
settlor
amends
it,
says,
give
it
all
to
john
smith,
provided
john
smith
gives
me
his
separate
company.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
all
with
them.
i
mean,
what
they're
saying
is,
look,
what
this
is
is,
they've
given
away
the
body,
or
a
share
thereof,
in
return
for
a
promise
that
has
nothing
to
do...
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
any
erisa
purpose,
any
labor
piece,
any
anything.
they
have
to
sign
away
other
claims
they
have
against
the
company
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
anything.
it
says,
others,
and
that's
their
claim.
so
what's
the
merits
of
that
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
they
can
give
away...
they
can
give
away
the
whole
shebang.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
line?
that's
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
this
a
kickback?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they've
said,
i
take
it,
that
everyone
now
would
concede...
i
don't
want
to
concede
for
them
if
they
don't
really
want
to...
that
you
have
a
plan,
a
certain
amount's
earmarked
for
vested
benefits,
somehow
there's
some
extra
cash
around,
and
the
settlor
has
amended
it
so
that
it
says,
take
all
the
extra
cash
and
give
it
to
smith,
who
happens
to
be
one
beneficiary,
provided
he
gives
to
me,
the
settlor,
his
house,
his
car
and
a
lot
of
other
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
all
right.
now,
i
take
it,
that
ought
to
be
unlawful,
but
i
don't
know
where
in
the
law
is
it
that
makes
that
unlawful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
not
for
the
settlor,
but
i'm
now
an
administrator,
for
the
first
time
come
to
this
act.
i
just
happen
to
walk
in
the
building,
and
there
i
happen
to
read
the
document,
and
lo
and
behold,
i
see
this
in
it.
do
i
follow
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
most
of
these
things
do
give
enormous
amounts
of
money
and
the
employer's
pocket.
if
he
settles
a
strike,
if
he
gets
people
to
retire
early,
there
are
lots
of
instances
where,
as
you've
read
in
the
sg's
brief,
to
enter
into
a
perfectly
reasonable...
make
a
perfectly
reasonable
provision
in
the
plan,
it
sounds
reasonable,
to
give
subset
a
of
employers
more
money...
employees
more
money,
and
in
return,
they
do
something
for
the
employer.
that
happens
every
day
of
the
week,
and
so
how
do
you
interpret
the
language
there
to
allow
that
and
to
forbid
something
else?
what's
the
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
not
necessary
to
settle
the
strike.
i
mean,
perhaps
it
isn't
necessary.
it
just
happens
that
the
workers
want
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
asking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
i'm
actually
worried
about
is,
this
seems
very
complicated
to
me.
maybe
it
shouldn't.
i
don't
see
what
the
line
is.
i'm
not
certain
it's
been
argued
below.
i
don't
even
see
in
the
record
what
the
document
is
that
we're
talking
about
or
how
it
should
be
interpreted.
should
we
decide--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
i
mean
the
release
itself.
should
we
decide
this,
or
should
we
send
it
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
just
doing
this
on
a
complaint
or
something,
aren't
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
even
argue
that.
we
don't
even
know
what
the
reasons...
i'm
nervous
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
standard?
i
mean,
congress
must,
for
example,
have...
wants
employers
to
give
people...
pay
$2,000
extra
money,
if
you
retire
early.
that
must
be
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
that
mean,
out
of?
a
retirement
agreement
by
an
executive
is
14
pages
long
in
small
print,
has
3,867
normal
provisions
in
it,
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
which
are
those
are
okay
and
which
aren't?
how
do
i
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
know
if
it
isn't
normal
to
have
an
anticompetition
agreement
when
an
executive
scientist
retires,
or
whether
it's
abnormal,
or
whether
it's
expected,
whether
you
could
never
get
it
without
it?
how
do
i
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--has
the
department
of
labor
ever
written
anything
that
would
help
us
with
this
that
you've
come
across?
