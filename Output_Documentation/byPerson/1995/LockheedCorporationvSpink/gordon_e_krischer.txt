mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
issues.
the
first
involves
whether
lockheed
corporation
breached
a
fiduciary
duty
when
it
amended
its
pension
plan
to
provide
an
incentive
for
employees
to
early
retire
and
included
as
one
of
the
eligibility
criteria
of
that
amendment
the
requirement
that
employees
who
were
voluntarily
retiring
sign
a
release
of
employment-related
claims.
there's
no
dispute
that
that
amendment
that
lockheed
adopted
complies
with
the
minimum
benefit
accrual,
minimum
vesting,
and
minimum
participation
standards
required
by
erisa,
and
there's
also
no
doubt
that
whether
participants,
employees
who
took
advantage
of
this
increased
retirement
benefit,
did
so
voluntarily,
which
is
to
say,
they
voluntarily
did
it.
it
was
not...
it
was
a
new
benefit.
no
employee
who
opted
to
choose
this
increased
pension
benefit
had
to
give
up
anything
he
or
she
was
otherwise
entitled
to
prior
to
the
existence
of
this
benefit.
the
second
issue
also
raised
by
mr.
spink
in
this
because
of
his
unique
circumstances
goes
to
whether
the
amendments
made
to
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act,
and
erisa
by
obra
1986,
the
omnibus
budget
reconciliation
act
of
1986,
should...
whether
congress
intended
that
those
changes
be
applied
retroactively.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
well,
i
don't...
i
believe
it's
the
same
question
that's
being
raised,
justice
o'connor,
because
what
the
ninth
circuit
held...
it
didn't
make
a
big
distinction
between
the
plan
sponsor
and
the
retirement
plan
committee
that
would
pay
the
benefits
to
eligible
employees.
the
district--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--i
think--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--the
first
point,
your
honor,
there
are
petitioners
in
this
case,
including
the
individuals
who
are
on
the
retirement
committee
as
well
as
the
executives
of
lockheed,
who
were
sued
in
their
executive
capacity
because
they
adopted
or
had
the
company
adopt
the
amendment.
but
you're
correct,
the
solicitor
general
has
raised,
really
for
the
first
time,
a
distinction
possibly
between
implementation
of
a
lawfully
amended
plan
with
a
lawful
amendment
on
the
one
hand
and
whether
actually
adopting
the
amendment
on
the
other
are
separate
issues.
now,
in
this
case
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
make
that
distinction
and,
indeed,
i
think
respondent
in
their
opposition
doesn't
make
that
distinction.
they
call
it
a
false
distinction,
because
whether
it's
analyzed
as
a
question
of
plan
implementation
or
whether
it's
analyzed
as
a
question
of
plan
amendment,
the
key
issue
in
this
case
on
the
first
issue
is,
does
it
violate
any
substantive
requirement
of
erisa--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--the...
well,
i
think
both...
if
you
certainly
want
to
limit
yourselves
to
the
first
question,
the
court
can
do
it,
but
i
believe
that
both
questions
should
subsume--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--and
the
overall
question
is--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--well,
i
think
that's
what
we're
suggesting,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
well--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--yes,
your
honor.
the
adoption
of
the
provision
by
itself
was
not
unlawful
because
it
was
a
settlor
function,
but
even
if...
even
if
it
were
not
a
settlor
function,
the
substantive
provision
of
this
amendment
doesn't
constitute
a
prohibited
action
under
erisa
section
406.
now,
what
the
district
court
held,
and
really
no
one
has
taken
issue
with
this
in
the
ninth
circuit
decision
or
under
the
petitions
here,
and
it
held
at
page
31a
of
the
petition,
and
i
will...
appendix
31a
of
the
petition,
and
the
nub
of
this
case
is
held
up
in
the
third
line:
indeed,
the
sole
fiduciary
duty
implicated
by
the
amendment
was
the
duty
owed
to
defendant
stockholders.
the
court
views
the
subsequent
payment
of
enhanced
benefits
to
selected
participants
as
merely
the
defendant's
adherents
in
his
role
as
plan
administrator
for
the
terms
of
the
lawfully
amended
plan.
now,
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
is,
the
whole
scheme,
amending
the
plan
and
paying
benefits,
that
whole
entire
scheme
is
a
violation
of
erisa
section
406,
because
it...
what
has
happened,
the
plan
has
been
amended,
employees
have
volunteered
to
retire,
and
they
are
now
receiving
the
benefits.
and
what
the
solicitor
is
suggesting
is
that
a
plan
fiduciary
who
is
complying...
there's
no
doubt
that
the
fiduciaries
that
are
paying
the
benefits
are
complying
with
the
terms
of
the
plan,
so
what
is
the
fiduciary
to
do
if
the
question
remains
open,
which
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
really
leave
open--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--that
is
correct,
and
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
quarrel
with
that
and
didn't
differ
on
that
point.
the
ninth
circuit
did
hold,
though,
that
the
adoption
of
the
amendments
created
a
significant
benefit
for
lockheed,
and
that
adoption
of
the
amendments
anticipated
payment
of
benefits
pursuant
to
the
amendment
constituted
a
prohibited
transaction,
because
the
court
was
aware...
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
fully
aware
that
benefits
are
being
paid,
and
those
employees
that
quality
for
the
benefits
because
they
met
the
eligibility
criteria
are,
in
fact,
receiving
benefits
right
now.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
it
purported...
the
ninth
circuit,
your
honor,
purported
not
to
decide
that
question,
but
in
essence--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
it
depends,
i
think,
on
the
trust
instrument,
but
i
think--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--i
think
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
well,
i
don't
think
that
under
erisa
that
can
be
done.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
because
there
are
other
requirements
under
erisa
that
state
what
the
minimum
participation
funding
investing
standards
are.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
mr.
justice
breyer,
i
agree
that
that
claim
is
presented
her,
but
the
merits
of
the
claim
are
that
there
is
no
bright
line
other
than
in
406
that's
drawn,
and
that's
the
prohibited
transaction
rule.
an
employer--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--i'm...
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
an
employer,
when
it
adopts
a
pension
plan
or
increases
benefits
in
a
pension
plan
does
so
in
its
self
interest,
and
unless
it
violates
the
minimum
participation,
vesting,
or
benefit
accrual
standards,
or
it
constitutes
a
prohibited
transaction,
which
we
contend
benefit
payments
are
not,
paying
benefits
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
plan
is
not
a
prohibited
transaction,
otherwise
plans
wouldn't
pay
benefits.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
he
can
terminate
it
at
any
time.
he
has
to
follow
the
erisa
guidelines
as
to
how
the
assets
are
allocated.
it
can
be
terminated
at
any
time.
it
can
be
increased
at
any
time.
what
the
employer
is
doing
is
making
a
promise.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
the
first
part
of
that,
ms.
justice
ginsburg,
would
be.
the
first
part,
meaning
you
can
condition
entry
into
the
plan
on
raising...
releasing
present
claims,
so
that
you
say
only
those
who
are
eligible
to
get
this
new
benefit.
i
am
promising
a
new
benefit
only
to
those
that
release
present
claims.
but
future
claims,
erisa
would
preclude
that,
and
the
reason
erisa
would
preclude
future
claims
is,
once
the
benefit
is
established
and
in
place,
it
has
to
meet
the
minimum
participation
benefit
accrual
investing
standards
so
to
have
that
condition
as
part
of
the
plan
in
the
future
to
defeat
or
defease
vested
claims
or
benefit
accrual,
i
don't
think
the
employer
could
do
that--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--but
that's
not
done
here.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
well,
for
example,
if...
there's
a
rule
in
erisa
in
title
i,
the
vesting
rules,
that
indicate
that
for
the...
generally,
that
an
employer
has
to
vest
in
the
benefit
within
a
5-year
period,
and
if--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--well,
i
don't...
it
may
not
prevent
vesting,
but
it
may
make
it
subject
to
defeasement.
i'm
not
sure,
as
a
state
law
matter,
someone
can
in
fact
waive
future
claims.
i
mean--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--they
are
not
different
if
you
can
assure
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
department
of
labor
and
courts
that
you
are
not
linking
vesting
or
benefit
accrual
to
some
future
event.
if
you
are
not,
in
fact,
linking
them
to
some
future
event,
then
i
think
it
is
perfectly
lawful
to
do
that.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
that's--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--it
is
not
criminal,
and,
indeed,
the
courts
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
favor
settlement
of
claims.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
the
term
in
the
plan
would
still
be
a
valid
term.
it
may
be
the
particular
release
is
not
enforceable
in
state
or
federal
courts.
we
have
that
situation
right
now
because
the
plan...
the
release
that
employees
in
this
case
were
asked
to
sign
if
they
wanted
this
increased
benefit
released
all
claims
related
to
employment,
but
in
california,
an
employee
cannot
release
a
worker's
compensation
claim
unless
it's
approved
by
the
worker's
compensation
appeals
board.
if
lockheed
thought
that
by
getting
a
release
signed
here
it
was
relieving
itself
of
worker's
compensation
claims,
it's
wrong,
and
it
was
not,
and
the
fact
that
lockheed
was
wrong
doesn't
prevent
these
employees
from
continuing
to
get
their
benefits.
the
only
requirement
was
that
they
sign
a
release.
there's
no
requirement
that
it
be
enforceable
or
valid
in
all
courts
for
all
purposes.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
i
believe
that
if
the
release
is
otherwise
enforceable
under
those
substantive
provisions,
it
is
enforceable
and
this
provision
is
not
unlawful,
and
indeed,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
regulation--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--no,
the
federal
government
could
protect
them,
too,
as,
in
fact,
it
has
under
the
age
discrimination
act,
for
example.
the
age
discrimination
act,
in
order
to
have
a
valid
waiver
of
age
discrimination
claims,
the
release
has
to
have
certain
recitations
and
be
in
a
certain
format.
if
this
release
doesn't
meet
that
format,
then
age
discrimination
claims
will
not
be
waived.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
requirement
of
a
release--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--is
independent
of
whether
it's
enforceable.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
our
position
is,
it
would
be
permissible
to
make
the
amendment.
the
amendment
itself
may
be
unlawful.
the
act
of
amending
the
plan
is
not
a
fiduciary
act,
but
if
a
plan,
for
example,
required
the
pension
plan
committee
to
make
imprudent
investments,
the
making
of
that
investment
would
be
a
prohibited
transaction
and
separately
challengeable,
but
that
is
apart
from
the
design
of
the
plan.
what
an
employer
does--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--well,
i
don't...
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
government
goes
that
far.
they're
not
saying
this
will
be
a
prohibited
transaction.
they're
saying,
they
don't
know,
that
some
releases
might
be
okay,
and
some
releases
might
not
be
okay,
and
they
don't
draw
a
line.
all
parties
here
have
suggested
a
line
be
drawn.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
well,
we
suggest
that
the
line
be
drawn
that's
already
been
drawn
by
congress
in
the
statute
under
406,
and
that
is,
if
it's
a
benefit
payment,
a
payment
of
benefits
to
a
participant
required
by
the
plan,
that
is
not
a
prohibited
transaction.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
that
is
not
a
transaction
at
all.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
as
an
academic
matter,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
you
know,
these
pension
plans
are
set
up
in
the
real
world,
involving
real
concerns
of
employees,
and
i--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--that
goes
too
far.
nothing
that
the
pension
plan
authorizes,
but
payment
of
benefits
pursuant
to
the
lawful
terms
of
the
plan
would
not
violate
406.
i'll
give
you
a--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--that
is,
your
honor.
it's
on
page
37a.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
responding
to
the
first
question,
and
then
the
hypothetical,
if
i
might,
everything
an
employer
does
with
respect
to
its
promise
as
to
what
the
benefit
level
will
be
is
in
the
employer's
self-interest.
asking
for
a
release
is
indistinguishable
on
that
basis
under
the
prohibited
transaction
rules
from
settling
a
strike,
from
requiring
as
a
condition
of
increased
benefit
a
covenant
not
to
compete,
other
kinds
of
things
employers
do
that--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--you're
correct.
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
that
underscores
my
point
that
everything
that's
in
the
plan
when
it
was
amended
or
set
up,
in
terms
of
benefit
payments,
is
in
the
employer's
self-interest.
the
answer
to
the--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--if
i
might--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--i'd
like...
the
second
half
of
the
hypothetical,
that
pushes
the
line,
and
that
is
difficult.
i
acknowledge
that
it's
difficult,
but
if
what
you've
described
is
really
a
kickback
scheme
so
that
an
employee
really
is
getting
a
pension
benefit
and
kicking
it
back
to
the
employer,
that
is
unlawful
under
the
benefit
accrual
and
participation
provisions
of
erisa
and,
your
honor,
it
may
be...
it
may
be
a
federal
crime.
i
mean,
if--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--what
you're
doing--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--it
is
not
a
violation
of
this
section.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
the
party
in
interest
here...
there
are
two
parties
in
interest.
one,
respondent
will
argue
lockheed
is
a
party
in
interest
because
it's
the
employer.
the
other
person
that's
a
party
in
interest
here,
the
government
has
argued
in
its
brief,
or
suggested,
are
employees,
that
under
the
government's
theory
it
would
be
unlawful
to
ever
pay
a
plan
benefit
to
an
employee
while
they're
an
employee,
because
while
they're
an
employee
they're
a
party
in
interest,
and
the
only
reason
you
pay
benefits
to...
that's
the
purpose
of
the
plan.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
it
is
not
a
kickback
because...
for
several
reasons.
those
employees
that
thought
they
had
claims,
no
one
was
required
to
sign
a
release
who
didn't
want
to.
those
employees
who
thought
they
had
claims,
like
mr.
spink,
just
simply
didn't
sign
a
release.
it
was
entirely
voluntary.
secondly,
this
is
a
release
of
potential
claims.
what
the
employer
was
trying
to
accomplish
here
was
an
early
retirement
program
and
not
be
sued
by
a
number
of
ex-employees
who
may
have
second
guesses,
or
monday-morning
quarterbacking
about
whether
they've
made
that
decision.
so
admittedly
the
complaint
as
pleaded
below
is
a
release
of
all
employment-related
claims,
but
that's
what
employers
do
when
they
sever
a
relationship
with,
in
the
most
part,
long-term
employees,
because
in
order
to
qualify
for
this
benefit,
most
of
the
employees
who
qualified
were
long-term.
but
i
admit
that
you
can
think
of
scenarios,
but
there
are
other
things
that
employers
may
wish
to
accomplish
from
their
benefit
plans.
for
example--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--if
it's
a
sham
transaction,
i
suppose.
title--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--well--
mr.
gordon

--if--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--no.
as
long
as
it
is
part
of
the
promise
the
employer
made
to
the
employee,
and
the
employee
is
getting
the
benefit
promised
by
the
plan,
we
submit
it
is
not
a
prohibited
transaction.
congress
didn't
deal
with
that
in
the
406
rule.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
it
is
not
a
prohibited
transaction
under
406
because
it's
not
specifically
mentioned,
and
it
may
not
be
a
prohibited
transaction,
but
it
may
otherwise
be
unlawful
under
another
provision
of
erisa.
for
example--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--that's
correct,
and
one
such
other
section
is...
would
be
section
403...
i'm
sorry,
section
1054(g),
which
is...
which
specifically
says
an
amendment
to
a
plan
may
not
cut
back
benefits.
so
that
if
an
employee
is
entitled
to
$1,000
a
month
benefit
and
the
employer
amends
the
plan
to
say,
we're
cutting
back
the
benefit
to
$500,
1)
the
amendment
may
be
itself
unlawful
and
challenged
and
the
employer
can
be
sued,
and
2)
the
fiduciary,
by
paying
the
lower
benefit,
may
be
breaching
a
fiduciary
duty
to
follow
a
substantive
provision
of
erisa,
but
406,
the
prohibited
transaction
section,
is
not
violated
because
it
is
not
a
prohibited
transaction.
it
is
not
one
of
those
enumerated
transactions
that
are
listed
in
406,
which
was
supposed
to
be,
under
this
court's
decision
of
the
keystone
consolidated
case,
a
bright
line
test.
now,
the
government's
suggestion--
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
--that
would
be
giving
a
loan
to
lockheed,
taking
money
out
of
the
plan
and
giving
it
to
a
participant
in
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
plan,
doing
something
with
the
assets
that
are
different
than
paying
benefits.
mr.
gordon
e.
krischer
well,
in
part
we
are
saying
that.
we
have
made
the
argument
that,
indeed,
paying
the
benefits
here
under
this
circumstance
doesn't
involve
a
discretionary
act
at
all.
it
is
just
simply
paying
the
benefit
that
someone
had
earned.
the...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
