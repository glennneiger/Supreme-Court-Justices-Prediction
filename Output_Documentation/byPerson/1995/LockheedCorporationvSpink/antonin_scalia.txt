was
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
depends
on
how
you
want
to
argue
the
case.
if
you
want
to
argue
the
case
that
the
reason
we
should
find
for
you
on
the
first
question
is
that
the
settlor
is
not
a
fiduciary,
then
our
answer
will
not
answer
the
second
question.
now,
i
suppose
there
are
other
bases
on
which
we
could
answer
the
first
question.
i
suppose
we
could
say
even
if
he
is
a
fiduciary
the
provision
is
not
violative.
if
we
answered
it
that
way,
you
would...
whether
we
explicitly
address
the
second
question
or
not,
you
would
implicitly
answer
the
second
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
not
really.
i
think
most
of
your
brief
went
to
the
fiduciary
point--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
fiduciary
point
is
not
going
to
answer
this
second
question,
but
do
you
have
an
argument
that
even
if
the
settlor
were
a
fiduciary
the
adoption
of
this
provision
would
not
have
been
unlawful?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
the
district
court
opinion
you
were
quoting
from,
not
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
--he
can
terminate
the
plan
if
there's
no
contractual
commitment
to
continue
it,
can't
he,
the
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
terminate
it
entirely.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
provision
is
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
these
vested
provisions
that
are
going
to
be
violated
by
that
commitment?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he's
vested.
he's
given
up...
he
has
now
committed
to
give
up
all
those
future
claims.
he's
done
what
was
requested.
why
does
that
prevent
his
vesting?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
assuming
he
can.
that's
a
totally
different
question,
but
if
he
can,
i
don't
see
why
that's
any
different
under
erisa
from
what's
at
issue
here.
now,
maybe
they're
both
okay,
but
you're
telling
me
one
is
different.
i
want
to
know
why
it's
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
position
is
that's
okay
because
he
doesn't
have
to
set
up
this
plan
anyway,
and
he
can
terminate
it
at
any
time,
so
he
can
make
it
conditional
on
anything
that
isn't
criminal.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
that
giving
up
your
claim
against
an
employer
is
not
criminal.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
basic
condition
of
continuing
to
work
for
the
employer.
the
quid
pro
quo
for
the
plan
is
always
something
of
interest
to
the
employer,
so
if
giving
the
employer
a
quid
pro
quo,
your
argument
goes,
were
to
violate
this
provision,
every
plan
violates
this
provision,
because
the
employer
never
gives
his
money
away
for
free.
he
at
least
says
you've
got
to
work
for
me
for
10
years
to
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
problem
is
that
i
could
think
of...
my
problem
is
not
that
i
can't
think
of
scenarios.
my
problem
is
that
i
don't
know
how
you
distinguish
the
scenarios,
how
you
distinguish
the
kickback
from
every
other
quid
pro
quo.
what
characterizes
something
as
a
kickback?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
sham?
he
really
wants
to
get
the
employee
to
waive
all
future
causes
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
he
really
wants
to
get
the
employee
to
promise
to
make
him
a
loan
at
1
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
sham.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
sufficient,
but
not
very
helpful.
i
mean,
if
you're
running
a
plan,
it's
not
very
helpful
to
know
that,
i
mean,
this
can't
be
done,
and
we
say,
well,
maybe
it
can't
be
done,
but
if
it
can't
be
done,
this
is
not
the
reason
it
can't
be
done.
there
may
be
some
other
reason.
i
don't
think
that's
why
we
took
the
case.
i
really
thought
we
were
going
to
try
to
clarify
the
law
for
the
businesses
out
there
that
have
these
plans,
so
why
should
we
take
the
narrower
ground
if
there's
a
broader
ground
that
does
clarify
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
matter
of
plan...
as
a
matter
of
plain
language,
the
fiduciary
does
that
whenever
he
pays
out
the
benefits
only
if
the
employee
continues
to
work
for
the
employer.
i
mean,
there's
always
a
quid
pro
quo,
and
if
you
count
the
quid
pro
quo
as
being
covered
by
this
provision,
every
plan
would
be
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
give
it
the
narrowest
meaning
that
will
allow
the
act
to
have
some
function?
i
mean,
why
is
settling
up
when
you
leave
the
company
all
of
the
controversies
between
you
and
me
that
exist
at
that
date,
why
is
that
so
unrelated
to
the
employer's
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
quid
pro
quo
is
sucked
into
that.
that's
the
use
of
the
plan
assets
includes
whatever
you
should
get
for
a
quid
pro
quo--
justice
antonin
scalia
--except
you
want
to
make
an
exception
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--ms.
traber,
how
would
it
fit
into
your
scheme
if
the
employer
offered
early
retirement
to
people
but
said,
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
want
you
working
for
my
competitors,
so
if
you
retire
and
commit
yourself
not
to
take
the
knowledge
that
you've
acquired
from
my
business
and
work
for
competitors
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
and
if
you
make
that
commitment,
you
can
get
this
early
retirement.
would
that
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
benefits
participants
by
inducing
the
employer
to
make
a
plan
provision
that
otherwise
wouldn't
be
made.
i
mean,
every
time
we
say
there's
another...
you
know,
another
quid
pro
quo
that
the
employer
can't
get,
you're
inducing
employers
to
have
that
fewer...
that
fewer
plans.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
be
your
position
that
if
a
company
has
a
standard
retirement
agreement
with
its
employees
that
all
employees
when
they
retire
sign
and
if
they
sign
they
get...
i
don't
know,
they
get
a
termination
benefit,
and
if
an
erisa
plan
refers
to,
you
know,
you
can
get
increased
erisa
benefits
if
you
retire
pursuant
to
the
normal
retirement
procedures
of
the
company,
if
any
of
those
retirement
procedures
in
the
standard
form
of
the
company
that's
even
used
apart
from
erisa,
if
any
of
those
include
anything
other
than
working
for
the
company,
the
erisa
retirement
thing
would
be
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--my
hypothetical
is
that
the
condition
is
not
in
the
erisa
plan,
but
it
is
incorporated
by
reference.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says,
if
you
retire
in
good
standing
and
sign
the
ordinary
retirement
agreement
that
the
company
has,
okay,
and
that's
a
standard
agreement
that
it's
had
for
years,
would
a
reference
to
that
in
the
erisa
plan
make
the
retirement
benefit
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
saying
that's
one
thing
that
it
could
cover,
but
by
its
text
it
covers
much
more
than
that.
i
mean,
by
its
text
it
says
the
amendments
made
only
apply
to
plan
years
beginning
after
january,
on
or
after
january
1,
and
only
with
respect
to
service
performed
on
or
after
such
date.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
pretty
clear.
