rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-809,
lockheed
corporation
v.
paul
spink.
mr.
krischer.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
your
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
krischer.
mr.
bress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
violation.
how
do
you
get
that
distinction
out
of
section
50...
406?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--ms.
traber,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
this
statutory
section?
you
just
referred
us
to
a
page
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
saying
that
erisa,
at
least
that
section,
incorporates
all
of
the
other
legal
prohibitions
against
what
a
trustee
can
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you
saying
it's
a
violation
of
erisa
for
a
plan
to
adopt
a
provision
that
would,
say,
be
contrary
to
a
state
law
for
a
trustee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
need
to
make
that
point
for
your
argument
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
not
relying
on
any
proposition
that,
because
this
might
have
violated
some
other
law,
it's
bad.
your
argument's
self-contained
within
erisa.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
just
had
a
brand-new
plan
that
justice
scalia
provided,
not
a
plan...
not
an
amendment
to
an
existing
plan,
would
there
be
anything
wrong
with
those
conditions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
really
do
discourage
employers.
i
mean,
here
you
have
an
employer
who's
going
to
set
up
a
new
plan
and
offer
benefits
to
employees,
and
you
say
that
most
of
the
benefits
he
would
like
to
offer
make
the
plan
invalid.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
the
text
of
obra,
ms.
traber?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
going
so
fast
i'm
having
great
difficulty
following
you.
you're
saying
now
that
the
department
has
been
inconsistent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
they
take
the
position
you
think
is
inconsistent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
has
the
proposed
regulation
been
adopted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
traber.
the
case
is
submitted.
