can
you
have
any
conditions
on
it?
let's
say
in
the
initial
plan,
when
it
first
comes
up,
the
employer
says,
i'm
going
to
make
these
retirement
benefits
available
to
any
and
all
workers
who
will
agree
that
they
will
relinquish
any
claims
of
any
kind
that
they
now
or
hereafter
should
have
against
the
company.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
krischer,
you
just
said--
--well,
what
the
employer
is
doing--
--something
about
state
law.
you
said,
maybe
giving
up
future
claims
would
be
something
impermissible
under
state
law.
suppose
state
law
says,
employer
agreements
that
require
employees
to
relinquish
any
and
all
claims,
even
past.
that's
against
the
state
public
policy,
and
we
don't
allow
it.
that's
the
state
law.
what
about
the
validity
of
such
a
term
in
a
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
about
federal
claims?
you
explain
that
the
state
can
protect
its
workers,
say,
with
tort
claims,
unemployment,
but
what
about,
say,
title
vii
claims,
because
this
waiver
would
include
race
discrimination
claims
as
well
as
tort
claims,
or
worker's
compensation
claims.
what
about
the
federal
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you're
making
a
distinction
between
federal
claims
and
state
claims
who's
saying
the
state
can
protect
the
workers
despite
the
plan
provision,
but
as
far
as
federal
claims
is...
there's
no
protection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
just
defer
the
essential
question.
that
would
defer...
the
essential
question
is,
can
you
give
enhanced
benefits
for
early
retirement
with
this
kind
of
condition
and
waiver
of
all
employment-related
claims,
and
that
one,
as
far
as
your
brief
went,
you
refused
to
give
an
answer
to
it.
you
said
that's
still
open.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
ninth
circuit
wasn't
making
that
distinction,
that
it
was
really
answering
the
second
question
against
the
plan,
against
lockheed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
we
send
it
back,
then
they
say,
well,
we
answered
both
questions,
so
our
answers
still
stand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the
first
issue,
what
you're
saying,
they're
buying
the
releases
with
tax-benefitted
dollars,
otherwise
they'd
have
to
pay
for
them
with
their--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
funds
that
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
traber,
in
that
light,
could
you
tell
me
what
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
thought
it
was
leaving
over
in
footnote
5
to
its
opinion?
it
apparently
thought
that
there
were
a
number
of
questions
that
it
need
not
address
in
view
of
its
position
on
the
amendment
being
impermissible.
justice

it's
