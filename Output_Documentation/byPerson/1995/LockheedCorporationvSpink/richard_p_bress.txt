mr.
richard
p.
bress
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
on
both
questions
presented
in
this
case,
although
our
reasoning
differs
from
theirs
on
several
related
issues.
as
to
the
first
question,
lockheed's
conduct
in
amending
the
plan
did
not
violate
erisa's
prohibited
transaction
rules,
because
in
amending
the
plan
lockheed
acted
as
plan
sponsor,
or
settlor,
not
as
a
fiduciary.
that
is
a
sufficient
and,
we
believe,
the
appropriate
basis
on
which
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
your
honor,
with
respect,
the
petition
for
certiorari
argued
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
circuit
only
on
the
question
of
whether
an
amendment
can
be
an
act
itself
that
violates
section
406,
so
presumably
that
was
the
ground
on
which
the
court
took
certiorari.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we...
that
issue
is
not
one
on
which
we
or
the
lower
courts
have
to
this
point
given
significant
thought,
at
least
before
this
case
arose,
and
for
that
reason,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
i
believe
that
this
court
should
decide
the
question
that
was
actually
argued
in
the
cert
petition,
and
while
this
other
matter
is
a
broader
matter,
perhaps
of
greater
concern,
the
court
may
well
fair
better
by
allowing
that
issue
to
percolate
some
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
ninth
circuit
answered
both
questions
against...
against
lockheed.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
the
one
issue
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
not
dealt
with
so
far,
your
honor,
is,
assuming
that
the
amendment
of
the
plan
is
itself
a
lawful
act,
whether
implementation
of
that
amendment
is...
is
therefore
lawful
or
tends
to
be
unlawful,
petitioners
have
argued
at
points
in
this
case
that,
given
a
lawful
amendment,
implementation
can't
be
unlawful
because
it
can't
be
unlawful
for
the
fiduciary
to
pay
benefits
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
all
right,
let
me
turn
to
that,
then,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--okay.
as
a
matter
of
plain
language,
your
honor,
when
a
fiduciary
authorizes
the
payment
of
enhanced
pension
benefits
in
return
for
an
employee's
waiver
of
all
claims
as
to
the
employer,
the
fiduciary
is
causing
the
plan
to
engage
in
a
transaction
that
constitutes
a
use
of
plan
assets
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer.
that
is--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
we
agree
with
you
entirely
that
it
would
similarly
fall
within
the
plain
language--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--to
pay
benefits
in
return
for
an
employee's
services.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
however,
it's
very
clear
within
erisa
that
that's
what
congress
was
talking
about.
you've
got...
whether
you're
talking
about
the
definition
of
a
participant,
which
is
an
employee
or
a
former
employee,
whether
you're
talking
about
how
plans
are
set
out,
there
are
employer
plans
or
employee
organization
plans.
when
you
look
at
the
participation,
vesting,
and
accrual
rules
in
sections
202,
203,
and
204
of
erisa,
you
see
years
of
service,
you
see
average
compensation
for
years
of
service.
these
are
concepts
that
go
all
through
erisa,
so
you
can
say,
then,
that
applying
section
406
in
context,
where
you've
got
services
being
rendered
and
in
return
you're
paying
benefits,
would
frustrate
the
entire
purpose
of
the
act.
it's
a
far
different
thing,
however,
to
say
406
shouldn't
be
given
its
plain
reading
because
congress
anticipated
and,
indeed,
intended
to
encourage--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--we're
not
saying
that
it's
unrelated
to
the
employer's
business,
your
honor,
and
we're
certainly
not
saying
that
erisa
says
anything
about
an
employer's
right
to
use
its
own
money
to
buy
a
waiver
of
claims
against
it
any
more
than
erisa
prohibits
its
employer
to
use
its
own
money
to
buy
the
employee's
house
or
car.
all
we're
saying
is
that
it's
doubtful
that
congress
intended
to
permit,
indeed,
to
encourage
employers
to
use
plan
assets
for
that
purpose.
congress
was
well
aware--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
our
view
is
that
the
amendment
itself,
the
act
of
amending,
was
not
unlawful
under
section
46
because,
while
amending
the
plan,
lockheed
was
not
acting
as
a
fiduciary.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no.
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
agree
with
lockheed.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
to
the
extent
that
the
employer
is
calling
for
a
waiver,
for
example,
of
prior
defamation
claims,
sex
discrimination
claims,
toxic
tort
claims,
things
of
that
sort,
that
it
is
a
violation.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
out
of
section
406,
your
honor,
what
we
take
from
there
is
that
you've
got
a
prohibition
that
is
very
strict,
it's
written
in
very
broad
language,
it's
in
fact
in
a
catchall
provision.
in
this
court's
decision
in
keystone,
the
court
looked
at
406
generally
and
opted
for
a
broad
interpretation
consistent
with
congress'
desire
to
protect
plan
assets,
so
what
we're
saying
is,
you
apply
406
by
its
terms
except
where
it's
very
clear
elsewhere
in
the
act
that
congress
didn't
mean
for
you
to
apply
it
in
that
context.
for
example,
you
couldn't
apply
406
to
prohibit
a
payment
of
advanced
benefits
in
return
for
an
employee's
services
because
that's
what...
very
clearly
what
the
act
is
about,
but
when
you
go
outside--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
wasn't
speaking
to
this
case,
but
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
what
we
would
say
to
that
is
that
pension
benefits
generally
have
served
dual
purposes.
one
is
to
attract
and
retain
employees
and
the
other
is
to
encourage
retirement.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
take
the
position
that
the
promise
itself--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
promise
would
be
covered
in
the
following
context,
and
that's
that
if
you
take
the
position
that
it's
only
the
outflow
of
cash--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--then
a
fiduciary
could
pledge
plan
assets,
guarantee
debts
with
plan
assets,
agree
to
loans
with
plan
assets,
and
all
of
that
would
be--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
we
don't
want
to
make
an
exception.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
we're
just
carving
as
narrow
exception
out
of
section
406
as
the
act
logically
permits.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
we're
talking
about
a
use
of
plan
assets,
your
honor,
not
a
transfer
here,
and
under
section
406(a)(1)(d)
a
use
of
plan
assets
is
included.
i
would
note
here,
by
the
way,
because
i
think
it's
important,
that
this
is
not
a
free
market
transaction
we're
talking
about.
erisa
provides
tax
subsidy
that
exceeds
$52
billion
a
year
to
encourage
employers
to
pay
pensions
to
employees,
and
it
should
not
lightly
be
presumed
that
congress
intended
to
extend
that
tax
subsidy
to
cover
purchases
of
all
claims
against
the
employer
or,
indeed,
employer's
houses
or
cars.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
second
question
presented
in
this
case,
the
obra
1986
issue.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that
is
correct,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--so
the
taxpayer
is
essentially
subsidizing
this
transaction.
thank
you.
