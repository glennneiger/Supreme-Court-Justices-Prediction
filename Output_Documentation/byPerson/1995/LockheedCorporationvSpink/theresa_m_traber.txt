ms.
theresa
m.
traber
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
spink
challenges
two
distinct
practices
which
together
resulted
in
a
benefit
to
him
of
$85
a
month
after
11
years
of
service
with
lockheed.
lockheed
tries
to
justify
these
two
practices
by
ignoring
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
let
me
first
turn
to
the
406
issue,
the
language
of
which
is
at
page
8
of
our
brief.
the
first
issue
is
whether
or
not
lockheed
was
a
fiduciary.
it's
our
position
that
an
amendment
which
directs
the
plan
administrator
to
violate
erisa
is
a
fiduciary
act,
and
that
nothing
in
erisa
or
the
common
law
supports
the
artificial
distinction
that
lockheed
has
made.
under
the--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
at
the
end
of
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
8,
which
is
the
language
of
406
on
which
we
rely
here.
the
common
law
carve-out
for
the
settlor
function
simply
does
not
encompass
any
kind
of
amendments
which
violate
the
law.
under
common
law,
whether
you
are
creating
a
trust
or
amending
it,
you
could
not
put
into
place
an
illegal
provision,
so
the
carve-out
does
not
apply
here.
so...
and
further,
under
404(a)(1)(d),
the
plan
administrator
has
a
fiduciary
duty
to
follow
the
terms
of
the
plan
unless
they
violate
erisa.
a
plan
sponsor
who
directs
a
plan
fiduciary
to
violate
that
term
inserts
itself
into
the
fiduciary--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--in
404(a)(1)(d),
yes,
absolutely.
it
says
that
the
fiduciary...
the
plan
administrator...
that's
not
the
language
on
page
8,
your
honor.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you...
that...
it
says
that
a
plan
administrator,
as
opposed
to
a
sponsor
may
not
implement
any
terms
of
the
plan
which
violate
erisa,
and
so
therefore
what
i'm
saying
is
that
where
a
plan
sponsor
orders
the
plan
fiduciary
to
violate
that
term,
they're
inserting
themselves
into
fiduciary
conduct.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
i...
i...
we
haven't
addressed
that,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
no,
your
honor,
and
4(a)(1)(d)
addresses
plan
terms
that
violate
erisa
specifically.
the
further
question
isn't
really
presenting
here.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
plan
terms
here
also
support
our
argument
that
this
was
a
fiduciary
act.
in
this
particular
case,
the
amendment
itself
inserts
lockheed
into
plan
administration
by
asking...
by
having
lockheed
collect
the
releases,
and
draft
them,
and
provide
a
list
to
the
administrator
of
who
has
met
the
eligibility
requirements,
so
every
aspect
of
this
amendment
indicate
lockheed's
invasion
into
the
sphere
of
plan
administration.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
there
are
quotations
to
many
statutes
in
the
papers,
your
honor.
i
believe--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--yes.
i
believe
it
is
quoted
in
our
argument
with
regard
to
the
amendment.
0....
i...
your
honor,
i
don't
find
exactly
where
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
i
believe
it
is
discussed
in
addition
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
with
regard
to
why
it
is
if...
on
a
separate
matter
why
implementation
of
an
illegal
plan
amendment
is
also
illegal
under
erisa,
but
i
don't
see
it
here.
i
apologize.
i'd
like
to
also
look...
direct
the
court's
attention,
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
in
a
footnote
on--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--404(a)(1)(d),
your
honor.
405
also
supports
our
position
in
that
it
directs...
405(c)(2)(a)(ii)
says
that
a
named
fiduciary
violates...
a
named
fiduciary
can
violate
404(a)(1)
if
it
establishes
a
written
procedure
which
is
improper
with
respect
to
designating
someone
who
can
take
over
the
obligations
of
that
named
fiduciary,
so
there...
it
isn't
true
that
there's
no
provision
in
erisa
which
actually
imputes
fiduciary
standards
and
fiduciary
duties
with
regard
to
an
amendment.
i'd
like
to--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--your
honor,
that
is
not
a
prohibited
transaction,
because
the
plan
is
not
a
party
in
interest.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
as
far
as
i
understand,
at
least
under
406.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
the
only
way
to
interpret
the
language,
which
was
passed
with
the
overriding
purpose
of
protecting
pension
benefits,
and
which
says
in
its
most
literal
form
that
plan
assets
may
not
be
used
by
a
party
in
interest
or
to
benefit
a
party
in
interest,
is
to
interpret
that
language
extremely
broadly
and
to
only
carve
out
uses
or
benefits
which
are
necessary
incidents
of
running
a
pension
plan.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
it's
a
more
difficult
issue,
but
i
believe
that
the
issue
of
settling
a
strike
is
very
similar
to
attracting
employees
at
the
outset.
if
you
have
higher
benefits,
the
employees
of
your
competitor
may
leave
that
competitor
and
come
to
work
for
you.
if
you
increase
your
benefits,
the
people
on
strike
may
say,
we'll
come
in
off
the
strike
because
we've
been
provided
with
pension
benefits
that
are
increased,
and
therefore
we're
not
going
to
have--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--the
same
beef
about
wage
claims.
excuse
me.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
the
release
itself,
your
honor?
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
well,
i
believe
that
the
court
below
decided
that
because
of
the
breadth
of
the
release
and
because
the
release
was
not
an
incidental
benefit
of
running
a
pension
plan
that--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--yes,
it's
a
12--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--that's
absolutely
correct.
it's
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
your
honor.
the
entire
complaint
was
dismissed
on
a
12(b)(6)
motion
by
the
district
court.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
i--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--i
believe,
if
it's
the
footnote
that
i
think
you're
referring
to,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
leaving
open...
it
was
leaving
open
the
separate
claims
of
whether
there
was
a
separate
violation
of
erisa
404
and
403,
and
also...
it
was
leaving
open
the
issue
of...
it
was
leaving
open
the
issue...
i
believe
what
it
decided
here
was
that
there...
although
it
may
have
been
inartfully
drafted,
i
believe
what
it
decided
here
was
where
there's
an
amendment
that
directs
a
violation
of
406,
then
that
is
a...
constitutes
fiduciary
conduct
and
results
in
prohibited
transaction,
but
it
was
leaving
open
the
broader
issue
as
to
whether
an
amendment
which
directs
a
violation
of
404
or
403,
which
it
decided
not
to
reach,
would
have
been
a
prohibited...
or,
excuse
me,
violations
of
those
provisions.
the
only
thing
that
is
actually
before
the
court
in
the
most
narrow
sense
is
whether
or
not
a
404...
excuse
me,
a
406
violation
has
been...
has
occurred
here
as
a
result
of
this.
i
would
state--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--it's
our
position
that
they
could
do
that
with
their
own
assets
paid
out
of
corporate
coffers.
they
could
not
do
that
with
plan
assets
because
that
additional
covenant
not
to
compete,
so
to
speak,
would
be
additional...
a
benefit
which
does
not
benefit
the
plan,
does
not
benefit
participants,
but
only
benefits
the
party--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--well,
your
honor,
the
statistics
on
that
that
are
quoted
in
the
brief
really
don't
bear
that
out.
the
statistics
in
the
gao
report
say
that
only
28
percent
of
any
employers
who've
done
early
retirement
plans
have
attached
waivers
to
them,
and
most
of
the
employers
say
that
the
reason
they
don't
attach
waivers
is
because
it
increases
morale
both
for
the
remaining
employees
and
for
the
retiring--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
much
more
difficult
question,
because
it
doesn't
deal
with
assets
that
are
already
held
in
trust,
and
i
believe
on
separate
issues
that's
a
violation
of
the
nonforfeitability
provisions
that
mr.
krischer
discussed
with
regard
to
vesting
provisions.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
your
honor,
if...
i
think
congress
was
trying
to
draw
a
very
bright
line
with
regard
to
assets
that
are
held
in
trust
and
receive
immense
tax
advantages.
for
example,
the
tax
advantages
that
flow
from
holding
these
assets
in
trust
are
many.
first
of
all,
the
dollars
that
are
put
into
the
plan
are
much
less
than
the
dollars
that
the
employer
can
pay
out
down
the
road,
so
because
the
income
of
the
trust
is
not
taxable,
they
can
actually
provide
greater
benefits
than
they
would
otherwise
be
able
to
pay.
further,
they...
if
you
have...
it
increases
the
ability
of
the
employer--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--i
think
the...
would
that
apply
to
either?
the
analysis--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--yes.
the
analysis
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
protect
would
apply
to
either.
i
think
the
most
difficult
question,
justice
stevens,
is
whether,
when
the
employee
retires
and
the
plan
administer...
in
a
new
plan,
under
mr.
chief
justice's
hypothetical
when
the
employee
retires
in
a
new
plan
that's
been
created
with
this
provision,
so
long
as
it
only
goes
to
claims
prior
to
the
plan,
the
issue
is
whether,
when
the
benefits
are
paid
out
in
exchange
for
looking
at
the
tally
and
seeing
whether
or
not
the
release
was
signed
and
whether
or
not
there
is
an
exchange,
that
violates
the
law.
but
that's
a...
and
i
don't
think
that
our
standard
necessarily
addresses
that,
but
i
think
that's
a
much
more
difficult
question.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
well,
i...
as
i
said--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--well,
as
i
said,
i
believe
under
our
standard
it
is
unlawful,
because
of
that
exchange--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
that's
okay,
so
long
as
it's
out
of
the
corporate
coffers.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
yes.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
there
are--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--well,
i
think
the
way...
i
think
congress
provided
an
explicit
procedure
for
doing
that.
under
408,
the...
well,
first
of
all,
in
the
legislative
history
congress
said,
we
want
this
to
be
broad.
we
recognize
it
encompasses
beneficial
transactions,
and
that
it
is
extraordinarily
broad.
if
someone
wants
an
exemption
from
it
because
a
particular
transaction
is,
in
fact,
beneficial,
or
wants
an
exemption
that
would
relate
to
an
entire
class
of
transactions,
the
option
that
they
have
under
408(a)
is
to
go
to
the
department
of
labor
and
seek
an
exemption,
and
that's
where
the
flexibility
is
in
the
statute,
and
that's
what
congress
said
the
provision
was
to
be.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
with
regard
to
this
particular
issue?
i
don't...
not
that
i'm
aware
of
with
respect
to
this
particular
issue,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
oh,
no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
their
welfare...
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
their
welfare
benefit--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--but
there's
a
plan--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--if
the
benefits
paid
out
are
conditioned
on...
if
the
benefits
paid
out
of
the
trust
are
conditioned
on
that
type
of
waiver,
yes,
it
would.
if
they
are
separate...
if
an
employer,
which
some
employers
do,
created
an
early
retirement
plan
with
plan
assets
and
then
separately
say,
and
in
addition
we'll
give
you
$1,000
if
you
sign
this
waiver,
that's
fine,
but
the
plan
assets
are
to
be
held
inviolate.
that's
why
congress
passed
406,
and
that's
what
the
plain
language
means.
if
it
may
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
issue
of
obra.
the...
we...
i'd
like
to
make
three
main
points
with
regard
to
that
issue.
first
of
all,
spink's...
mr.
spink's
overclaims
attack
a
discriminatory
plan
provision
that
was
put
into
place
in
1990,
and--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it's
on
pages
26
to...
the
key
provisions
are
on
pages
26
to
27
of
our
brief.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
and
the
two
acts
that
are
being
attacked
are
the
discriminatory
plan
provision
which
created...
which
lockheed
created
in
1990,
and
its
application
to
him
when
he
retired
in
june
of
1990.
the
events
at
issue,
therefore,
occurred
more
than
4
years
after
the
date
of
obra's
passage,
and
therefore
this
is
simply
not
an
issue
of
retroactivity.
turning
to...
looking
at
the
plain
meaning
of
the
benefit
accrual
provisions
which
are
set
forth
here,
the
provisions,
your
honor...
may
it
please
the
court,
the
provisions
that
i'm
referring
to
are
in
the
last
paragraph
on
page
26
and
beginning
at
the
top
of
the
page
and
into
the
indented
portion
on
page
27
for
your
reference.
all
of
these
provisions
refer
to
an
employee's
benefit...
rate
of
benefit
accrual
and
are
referenced
and
applied
only
to
employees
who
have
1
hour
of
service
with
any
of
the
applicable
plan
years.
it's
clear
from
a
textual
reading
of
these
provisions
that
they
were
intended
to
apply
equally
to
all
employees
during
those
plan
years
and
so
long
as
they
were
employees
during
those
years.
now,
lockheed,
by
relying
on
the
proposed
regulation,
and
the
solicitor
general,
concede
that
for
people
who
were
participants
before
obra
all
years
of
service
must
be
considered
in
the
benefit
accrual
calculation,
and
it
is
to
be
remembered
in
this
entire
mix
that
this
is
a
case
involving
a
defined
benefit
plan
where
the
antecedent
events
of
service,
of
salary
levels,
and
of
various
other
factors
that
are
included
do
not
have
any
clear
significance
until
the
date
of
retirement,
when
a
particular
benefit
formula
under
the
plan
is
applied
to
them.
it's
not
a
contributory
plan.
it
is
a
plan
which
is
a
defined
benefit
plan,
and
that's
why
the
solicitor
general
says
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
including
all
years
of
service
for
current
employees
and,
in
fact...
but
what
they
take
issue
with
is
our
interpretation
of
reduction
in
the
rate
of
benefit
accrual.
but
i
would
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
proposed
regulations,
and
you
will
find
there
that
they
did
not
take
the
same
position
with
regard
to
the
interpretation
of
reduction
of
rate
of
benefit
accrual
in
their
regulations.
on
the
contrary,
they
said
that
any
limitation
which
directly
or
indirectly
depended
on
age
would
constitute
a
breach
of
that.
that's
our
position
as
well.
they
also
said
that
if
there
were
new
benefits
which
were
denied
in
part
on
age--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--or
were
provided...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
yes,
your
honor.
the
department
has
taken
the
position
in
this
court
that
the
phrase,
reduction
in
the
rate
of
benefit
accrual,
means
only
something
that
goes
over
time.
that
is--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--the
position
that
i
believe
is
inconsistent
is
in
the
proposed
regulation
itself,
which
is
section
1.411(b)-2(b)-2-ii.
[laughter]
and
in
other
aspects...
they
also
say
that--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--no,
your
honor.
my...
our
point
is
that...
is
that
they
have
taken
inconsistent
positions
here,
but
that
the
position
that
we
have
taken
indicates
that...
is
consistent
with
the
proposed
regulation
to
the
extent
that
it
goes
to
the
broader
reading
by
the
department,
by
irs,
to
interpret
the
terms
of
the
plan.
what
they
go
further
and
do
is
carve
out
an
exception
which
is
nowhere
in
the
statute.
congress--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--your
honor,
because--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--because
you...
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
particular
at--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
is
that
that,
but
only
with
respect
to
years
of
service,
relates
to
the
provision
it
is
intended
to
implement,
which
is
a
repeal
and
an
application
of
a
delayed
retirement
age,
and
the
only
counting
that
is
done
under
those
two
limited
statutes
is
a
calculation
of
a
delayed
retirement
age.
that's
a
very
significant
factor.
that
means
that
when
they
passed
it
in
october
of
1986,
if
you
apply
the
2-year
delay
before
the
effective
date,
and
then
you
apply
the
delayed
retirement
age,
there...
under
206(a)
of
erisa
a
plan
with
respect...
had
the
option
under
obra
not
to
pay
a
person
like
mr.
spink
any
benefits
until
1993,
because
under...
they
could
delay
the
delayed...
the
normal
retirement
age
by
5
years,
and
then
they...
and
under
206(a)
they
need
not
pay
any
benefits
until
the
date
of
the
normal
retirement
age
at
the
latest.
there
are
a
series
of
dates,
but
that
is
the
latest.
so
basically...
and
congress
in
the
legislative
history
said,
we
recognize
that
there
is
an
issue
about
cost
of
funding.
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
and
your
honor,
there's--
ms.
theresa
m.
traber
--there's
no
necessary
relationship,
though,
between
those
participation
statutes
and
the
benefit
accrual
statutes.
as
we
demonstrated
in
our
brief,
benefit
accrual
calculations
can
include
all
manner
of
provisions.
there
are
baseline
minimum
calculation
standards
that
need
to
be
met,
but
the
formula
itself
can
be...
can
partake
of
various
factors,
service,
excess
salary...
it
can
be
a
plain
lump
sum
at
the
end
of
a...
or
a
percentage
of
salary
without
regard
to
years
of
service.
so
it
is...
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
to
indicate
that
these
two
provisions,
9203
and
its
effective
date,
were
designed
to
be
superimposed
on
separate
provisions,
9201
and
9202,
which
has
a
separate
effective
date.
lockheed
did
not
answer
many
of
the
questions
raised
in
our
brief,
including
why
are
there
two
effective
date
provisions
if
congress
intended
this
separate
provision,
which
is
only
a
couple
of
lines
down
from
the
other
one,
to
apply
to
the
other
provisions?
it's
just...
they're
trying
to
carve
out
an
exception
in
the
statute
that
doesn't
exist
there,
and
on
pages
4024
and
25
of
the
u.s.
code
and
congressional
and
administrative
news
in
1986
which
deals
with
obra,
congress
said
we
recognize
there
are
funding
issues,
and
therefore
we're
going
to
implement
the
delayed
retirement...
excuse
me,
the
delayed
normal
retirement
age.
they
didn't
say,
and
there
can
be
other
things
you
can
do
to
deal
with
the
funding
issues.
under
funding
statutes,
under
erisa
generally,
the
funding
for
those
benefits
don't
begin
until
the
effective
date.
they
wouldn't
have
done
for
lockheed.
thank
you,
your
honor.
