justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
excuse
me,
i
thought
that
wasn't
it.
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
it
violated
a
fiduciary
responsibility.
it
is
entirely
possible
that
the
plan
sponsor
might
violate
no
fiduciary
responsibility
and
yet
violate
some
substantive
bar
to
that
particular
amendment,
and
i
thought
we
only
had
the
first
question
in
front
of
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
that
point
is
sound,
it
is
sound
regardless
of
whether,
in
the
act
of
amendment
lockheed
was
acting
as
a
fiduciary
or
not,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
but
i
mean,
that
question...
the
answer
to...
all
i'm
getting
at
is
the
answer
to
that
question
is
not
going
to
be
dictated
by
whether
we
determine
that
lockheed
was
acting
as
a
fiduciary
in
making
the
amendment.
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
say
it's
not
a
prohibited
transaction,
or
do
you
say
it's
not
a
prohibited
transaction
unless
it
is
expressly
prohibited,
or
unless
it
is
prohibited
by
some
substantive
section
of
erisa?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying,
once
we're
in
a
situation
in
which
the
question
is
whether
the
payment
of
the
benefit
is
lawful,
you
simply
look
to
some
other
source
of
law,
you
don't
look
to
this
section.
justice
david
h.
souter
discretionary
acts.
its
application
is
limited
to
discretionary
acts,
which
are
not
provided
for
tin
the
plan,
which
are
not
expressly
authorized
in
the
plan.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
why
isn't
the,
what
you
call
the
exception
built
into
9204(b)?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
refers,
in
speaking
of
application,
not
only
to
plan
years
beginning
on
or
after
january
1,
1988,
and
only
with
respect
to
service
performed
on
or
after
such
date.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
before...
i...
it's
not
that
i
don't
want
to
hear
about
legislative
history,
but
what
about
just
the
plain
meaning
of
those
terms?
