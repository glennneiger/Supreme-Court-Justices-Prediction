mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
one
hundred
and
twenty
one
indian
tribes
in
23
states
have
entered
into
137
compacts
pursuant
to
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act.
the
act
carefully
balances
the
interests
of
three
sovereigns,
the
states,
the
united
states,
and
the
indian
tribes.
the
act
provides
the
states
with
an
opportunity
to
play
a
significant
role
in
the
scope
of
indian
gaming
within
those
states.
central
to
the
act
is
the
duty
of
state
officials
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
with
the
indian
tribes
regarding
gaming,
and
central
to
the
act
is
the
ability
of
the
tribes
to
sue
the
states
in
federal
court
if
the
states
have
not
negotiated
in
good
faith.
the
decision
below
held
that
the
seminole
tribe
did
not
have
the
right
to
sue
the
state
of
florida
and
its
governor
in
federal
court
despite
congress'
clear
promise
that
that
right
existed.
the
court
below
found
that
there
was
no
consent
by
florida
to
this
lawsuit,
and
that
under
article
i,
the
foreign...
i'm
sorry,
the
indian
commerce
clause,
there
was
no
power
in
congress
to
abrogate
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
finally,
the
court
found
that
ex
parte
young
did
not
work
in
this
case.
our
position
is,
is
that
there
is
the
power
to
abrogate
under
the
indian
commerce
clause,
and
that
if
there
is
not,
ex
parte
young
permits
federal
rights
to
be
vindicated
and
the
interests
of
the
supremacy
clause
to
be
protected
by
the
suit
against
the
governor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
under
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
they
can
go
directly
to
the
secretary
if
they
cannot
sue.
if
a
state
raises
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
if
a
state
will
not
negotiate
in
good
faith,
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
could
go
directly
to
the
secretary,
and
that
is
true
that
the
congress
could
have
kept
the
states
out
of
indian
gaming
altogether.
if
that
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
is
affirmed,
including
the
remedy
the
eleventh
circuit
left,
then
the
tribes
could
go
directly
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
scalia,
it
is
not
clear
that
one
can
go
directly
to
the
secretary.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
concluded--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--and
indeed,
the
state
has
cross
petitioned
in
this
case
complaining
about
that
aspect.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
given
the
alternative,
i
support
the
position.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
covered
in
the
act,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
tribe
could
then
file
the
lawsuit
that
is
envisioned
under
27(d)
against
the
state
for
failure
to
negotiate
at
all,
and
then
the
process
would
occur
just
as
it
would
in
this
case
where
there
was
negotiation,
but
the
tribe--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
means
you
get
to
the
secretary
ultimately.
if
the
state
has
failed
to
negotiate
at
all,
then
the
court
would
say
to
the
state,
you
have
an
opportunity
now
to
conclude
a
compact
within
60
days.
if
the
state
still
refuses
to
do
that,
then
a
mediator
would
be
appointed.
the
only
compact
submitted
would
be
the
tribe's
compact,
and
then
that
would
go
to
the
secretary.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
there
is.
the
case
or
controversy
is
whether
or
not
the
state
has
acted
in
good
faith,
has
negotiated
in
good
faith,
and
that
discrete
fact
is
one
that
needs
to
be
resolved
for
the
rest
of
the
process
to
work.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
there
do,
and
there
are
consequences.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if...
and
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
this
on
the
flip
side.
if
the
tribe
sues
the
state
and
says
the
state
has
failed
to
negotiate
in
good
faith,
and
the
state
wins,
the
tribe
is
absolutely
foreclosed
from
the
gaming
that
it
seeks.
if
the
state
loses,
and
the
court
holds
the
state
has
not
negotiated
in
good
faith,
then
the
consequences
are
the
state
will
be
given
one
more
opportunity
to
conclude
a
compact,
but
ultimately
it
will
lose
its
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
scope
of
gaming.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
there
is,
justice
o'connor,
and
that
is
presently
being
held
in
abeyance
on
appeal
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
because
if
there
was
no
judicial
power
to
act
in
the
first
place,
then
that
finding
would
have
to
be
vacated.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
finding
is
that
the
state
of
florida
did
negotiate
in
good
faith
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
perhaps,
but
certainly
it
didn't
do
that
here,
and--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--only
in
terms
of
federalism
and
concerns
for
federalism,
and
working
with
the
lightest
hand,
being
sensitive
to
federalism,
but
ultimately,
of
course,
if
congress
said,
state,
you
must
do
something,
and
the
state
fails
to
do
that,
then
yes,
the
contempt
power
would
come
into
play,
but
the
way
this
statute
is
constructed,
it
is
sensitive
to
federalism.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
public
official,
the
state
official
who
perhaps
would
have
assumed
the
duty,
but
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
not
this
statute,
and
that
is
not
this
case.
what
we
have
is
this
carefully
tailored
statute
that
says
to
the
state,
who
must
act
through
state
officials
in
order
to
negotiate,
negotiate
in
good
faith.
if
you
do
not,
you
will
lose
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
scope
of
gaming
because,
and
this
comes
back
to
congress'
plenary
power
over
indian
commerce,
because
we
could
have
done
this
without
you,
but
instead--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--justice
ginsburg,
then
we
are
back
to
cabazon,
and
the
states
could
engage
in
the
gaming
that
the
state
already
allows
without
any
regulation
by
the
states.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i'm
sorry,
the
indians,
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
thought
has
crossed
my
mind,
justice
ginsburg.
[laughter]
but
we
take
the
statute
as
congress
has
written
it,
but
it
is
true
that
if
we
lose
this
case,
and
if
the
state
can
preclude
the
lawsuit,
and
if
the
remedy
of
the
secretary
going
directly
to
the
secretary
is
really
not
a
remedy,
then
we
are
back
to
cabazon,
and
we
are
unregulated
in
class
iii
gaming,
but
we,
of
course,
are
subject
to
congress'
power
just
as
the
states
are
subject
to
congress'
power.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
absolutely
true,
justice
ginsburg
and,
indeed,
the
tribes
were
not
happy
with
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act,
because
they
preferred
the
cabazon
decision,
which
allowed
them
latitude
more
than
the
act
does,
and
so
yes,
it
is
true
that
this
argument
is
in
many
ways
a
defense
of
congress'
power,
but
if
congress
doesn't
have
that
power,
yes,
the
tribes
would
be
unfettered
by
state
regulation.
the
question
is
whether
or
not,
under
the
statute
as
constructed,
congress
can
abrogate
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
our
position
is,
is
that
the
plenary
power
of
congress
under
the
indian
commerce
clause
does
give
it
that
power
and,
indeed,
if
that
power
does
not
exist,
then
ex
parte
young
works
in
this
case
because
ex
parte
young
is
based
upon
the
duty
of
state
officials
to
follow
a
federally
enforceable
right,
and
the
federal
enforceable
right
here
would
be
the
duty
to
negotiate
in
good
faith.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
do
rely
upon
union
gas.
union
gas
is
an
interstate
commerce
clause
case--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--in
which
the
court
held
that
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
congress
has
the
power
to
abrogate
eleventh
amendment--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--we
do
believe
that.
we
had
argued
that
below,
that
the
interstate
commerce
clause
was
another
basis
for
congress
enacting
the
indian
gaming
act,
but
the
indian
commerce
clause,
it
seems
to
us,
is
the
stronger
basis
for
this
and,
indeed,
i
think
the
indian
commerce
clause
is
even
stronger
than
the
interstate
commerce
clause
when
one
looks
at
union
gas
in
terms
of
supporting
the
abrogation
power.
the
indian
commerce
clause
is
a
change
in
the
relationship
between
the
states
and
the
united
states
and
the
federal
government
by
giving
plenary
power
to
congress
in
the
area
of
indian
commerce.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
under
article
i,
congress
has
the
power
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
to
abrogate
state
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
stands
for
only
the
proposition
that
i
have
advanced--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--yes.
it
was
a
4
1
4
decision.
but
the
indian
commerce
clause
is
even
more
powerful
than
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
indeed,
this
court
has
used
forceful
and
strong
language
in
talking
about
congress'
power
under
the
indian
commerce
clause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that's
true.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it's
all
plenary
and
exclusive,
and
the
court
has
said
that
with
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
indian
relations
became
the
exclusive
province
of
federal
law,
and
this
is
important,
too.
in
the
seminole
nation
case
at
316
u.s.
at
page
296,
the
court
talked
in
these
terms
there's
a
distinctive
obligation
of
trust
towards
the
indian
tribes,
moral
obligations
of
the
highest
responsibility
and
order,
and
this
language
adds
great
credence
to
the
strength
of
the
indian
commerce
clause.
indeed,
the
state's
brief
at
page
23
concedes
that
there
are
no
limitations
upon
congress'
authority
under
the
indian
commerce
clause.
congress'
power
under
that
clause
is
complete.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
true,
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
they
would
like
to
read
it
only
one
way,
but
the
indian
commerce
clause,
when
one
looks
at
the
history
of
it,
clearly
was
a
taking
from
the
states
of
any
role
in
indian
commerce
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
all
that
the
states
are
being
ordered,
justice
kennedy,
is
a
duty...
is
to
negotiate
with
the
tribes
to
serve,
indeed,
the
state's
own
goals,
and--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--i
can
think
of
no
precedent
that
directly
addresses
that,
but
to
the
extent
that
your
question
brings
into
focus
a
tenth
amendment
kind
of
problem,
there
is
no
commandeering
here.
this
is,
unlike
the
tenth
amendment
cases,
which
talk
about
a
duty
to
regulate,
imposing
a
duty
to
regulate,
or
a
duty
to
legislate,
this
is
a
duty
to
negotiate.
this
is
sensitive
to
the
etiquette
of
federalism.
this
is
just
the
kind
of
delicate
balancing
that
falls
on
congress'
supremacy
clause
power
side
to
do
that
which
is
necessary
to
fulfill
all
of
its--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--young
is
built
on
the
premise
that
there
is
a
federal
duty,
and
there
are
other
cases...
morales
v.
texas,
a
federal
airline
deregulation
act,
green
v.
mansour,
edelman,
dealing
with
welfare
rights
laws,
in
which
the
court
has
utilized
ex
parte
young
to
compel
a
state
to
follow
federal
law.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
kennedy,
here,
the
federal
duty
is
to
follow
the
will
of
congress,
which
has
plenary
power,
and...
and
this
is
the
ironic
part
of
this
case...
participate
in
the
scheme.
that's
why
i've
said
that
this
statute
is
sensitive
to
the
interests
of
federalism.
it
is
different
from
ex
parte
young,
but
not
different
enough
to
make
a
difference
in
the
outcome.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
stevens,
i'm
in
a
strange
position
here,
and
it
must
be
one
of
the
first
times
in
history
that
a
lawyer
for
indian
tribes
is
arguing
to
give
the
states
a
chance
to
be
heard,
and
yet
that's
what
this
statute
does,
but
i
argue
for
it
because
we
think
it
is
right
constitutionally.
i'm
not
here
to
defend
congress'
power.
i'm
here
to
defend
the
tribal
sovereignty,
and
congress
has
seen
fit...
it
has
exclusive
plenary
authority
over
the
tribes,
and
it
does
over
the
states...
has
seen
fit
to
craft
this
delicately
balanced
statute.
there
is
nothing...
when
one
reads
the
statute,
the
tribe
and
the
state--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--they
are,
but--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--the
tenth
amendment
which
has
come
into
this
case
in
the
argument,
i
must
say
first,
is
not
before
the
court.
the
tenth
amendment
was
not
raised
below
by
the
state.
the
eleventh
circuit
refused
to
address--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--what
i
have
said,
justice
kennedy
is,
is
that
in
the
congressional
power,
the
plenary
power,
the
congress
does
have
the
power
to
abrogate
state
immunity,
and
this
is,
i
think,
critical.
there
is
no
compulsion
here.
the
compulsion
is
only
to
sit
down
and
talk
with
the
indian
tribes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
there
must
be
a
remedy,
and
the
remedy
is
that
the
rest
of
the
process
which
congress
had
the
power
to
create
would
then
be
triggered.
this
was
deferential
to
the
states,
and
that's
why
i
start
off
by
saying
it's
an
odd
and
strange
position
to
be
arguing
in
favor
of
the
states
having
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
one
question
was
asked
during
the
argument,
is
what
is
to
be
gained
by
the
states,
and
what
is
to
be
gained
by
the
states
is
something
that
they
would
not
otherwise
have
had,
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
scope
of
gaming.
is
that
better--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--they
are,
justice
scalia,
but
the
precedent
is
already
there
for
this
kind
of
order
from
a
federal
court.
it
is
not
intrusive.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
a
host
of
cases,
beginning...
morales
v.
twa,
for
example,
at
112
supreme
court,
which
i
mentioned
earlier,
is
a
case
where
ex
parte
young
was
used
to
enforce
federal
law,
not
constitutional
law.
ex
parte
young
works
in
this
situation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
used
and
cited
ex
parte
young
as
being
the
vehicle
for
suing
seven
attorney
generals,
i
think,
to
enjoin
them
from
enforcing
laws
that
would
have
violated
federal
laws,
and
so--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--but
the
statute
isn't
broken,
justice
scalia,
if
one
reads
the
cause
of
action
against
the
state
to
obligate
the
state
simply
to
the
duty
to
negotiate.
