mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
it's
glogau,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
congress
does
not
have
the
authority
under
the
indian
commerce
clause
to
subject
the
state
to
suit
in
federal
court,
nor
does
ex
parte
young
allow
a
suit
against
the
state
official
when
in
reality
you
are
suing
the
state.
justice
scalia,
in
answers
to
your
questions,
these
cases
are
in
fact
against
the
state.
the
statute
commands
the
state
to
act.
the
remedy
that
is
provided
is
directed
right
to
the
state,
so
just
on
its
surface
the
statute
addresses
the
state.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
your
honor,
the
state
is
not
completely
out
of
the
picture
in
that
situation.
public
law
280
allows
us
to
enforce
our
criminal
laws
on
the
indian
reservation,
so
in
that
respect--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
we
can
say
no
casino
because,
as
judge
marcus
found
in
the
district
court,
casinos
are
not
permitted
in
florida.
however,
the
reason
that
we're
here
is
not
a
gambling
issue.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
that...
permitted
means
in
our--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--your
honor,
we
are
not
aided
in
respect
to
gambling
as...
per
se,
as
an
issue.
the
reason
we
are
here
is
because
this
case
speaks
more
to
the
question
of
federalism
and
the
relationship
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
rather
than
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
have
gambling
in
florida.
that's
a
separate
issue
to
be
litigated,
and
is
being
litigated
separately.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--that's--
[laughter]
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
your
honor--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
first
of
all,
the
state
has
to
negotiate
under
the
statute.
the
statute
says,
you
shall
negotiate
in
good
faith.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
no,
what
we
don't
accept
is...
and
going
back
to
your
spending
clause
question,
under
the
spending
clause
cases,
the
remedy
for
not
doing
what
the
federal
government
wants
you
to
do
because
you've
taken
the
money
is
not
to
give
you
the
money.
the
remedy
given
here
is,
if
you
don't
do
what
we
want
you
to
do,
we
will
sue
you
in
federal
court.
the
eleventh
amendment
and
our
sovereign
immunity
prevents
us
from
being
held
before
a
federal
court
without
our
consent.
that
is
the
essence
of
sovereign
immunity.
without
consent,
we
cannot
be
sued,
and
we
have
not
consented
here.
under
the
idea
that
we
negotiated
so
therefore
we
take
the
benefit,
that's
an
idea
that
comes
out
of
this
court's
case
in
parden,
and
i
submit
that
we...
in
parden,
the
state
of
alabama
engaged
in
the
business
of
an
interstate
railway
years
after
the
fela
had
been
passed,
and
so
they
could
be
considered
to
have
looked
at
that
and
said,
okay,
if
we
do
this
business
we
will
subject
ourselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
waiving
their
sovereign
immunity.
we
don't
have
a
choice
here.
we're
given
the
choice
of
either
negotiating
in
good
faith
and
being
sued,
or
not
negotiating
at
all
and
being
sued.
that's
no
choice
at
all,
your
honor,
and
so
therefore
the
parden
type
of
consent
can't
be
found
in
this
situation.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
because,
your
honor,
we
have
no
option
to
opt
in
or
out.
the
statute
says
you
shall
negotiate
in
good
faith.
if
you
do
not,
you
will
be
sued
and
an
order
will
be
issued
by
a
federal
judge
saying,
you
shall
conclude
a
compact
within
60
days.
that
is
the
statutory
remedy.
we
are
not
given
a
choice
to
opt
out.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
we
are,
as
justice
kennedy
was
alluding
to
before,
even
though
the
statute
doesn't
specifically
give
the
court
contempt
power,
certainly
a
federal
court
has
the
inherent
power
to
hold
a
state
official
in
contempt
if
he
thumbs
his
nose
at
a
federal
court
order,
which
is
what
you're
suggesting
that--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--excuse
me?
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
if
the
statute
is
valid
and
the
state
can
be
sued,
or
if
the
governor
can
be
sued
under
ex
parte
young,
yes,
a
federal
judge
certainly
has
the
inherent
authority.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
i
would...
yes.
the
court
has
inherent
authority
to
enforce
its
orders,
and
that's
the
way
i
understand
a
federal
court
would
enforce
an
order,
and
that
is
to
hold--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
this
scheme
mandates
that
the
state
act,
and
so--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
your
honor,
then,
if
there's
no
teeth
in
this,
and
there's
no
order
that
can
be
enforced,
why
did
congress
provide
for
a
lawsuit?
if
the
state
simply
can
say,
we
don't
want
to
play--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more.
[laughter]
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
but
the
point
is,
your
honor,
if
congress
considered
the
state
to
have
an
option
just
not
to
be
involved
at
all,
then
there
was
no
point
in
having
a
lawsuit
provision.
it's
merely...
the
congress
should
have
written
a
law...
if
that
was
their
intent,
congress
should
have
written
a
law
to
say,
if
the
tribe
wants
to
have
casino
gambling
or
class
iii
gambling
in
the
state,
then
they
approach
the
state
and
ask
the
state
if
they
want
to
be
involved.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that
would
be
true,
your
honor,
if
we
were
given
the
choice.
we
are
not
given
the
choice
here.
we
are
ordered
by
the
statute
to
invoke
the
discretionary
machinery
of
the
state
in
negotiating
a
compact.
if
we
do
not,
we
are
subject
to
the
full
panoply
of
judicial
power
that
is
wielded
by
a
federal
judge.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
your
honor,
the
timing
of
the
decisions
is
peculiar...
even
more
peculiar
than
the
statute.
we
had...
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
it
went
on
appeal
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
while
it
was
pending
at
the
eleventh
circuit
we
got
an
order
on
summary
judgment
from
the
court
below.
only
after
we
were
found
to
have
complied
with
the
statutory
requirements
did
the
eleventh
circuit
then
say,
there's
no
jurisdiction.
but
the
point
is
that
the
reason
we're
here,
as
i
said
to
justice
ginsburg,
the
reason
we're
here
is
not
because
of
gambling.
we
are
here
because
of
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that
is
pending
on
appeal,
which
has
been
abated
pending
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
i
think
the
state
has
an
interest
in
both
of
those
things.
we
have
an
interest--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--right.
well,
we
have
an
interest
in
protecting
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
by
addressing
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
like
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act,
but
on
the
other
hand,
you're
correct
that
we
do
have
an
interest
in
preventing
gaming
that
is
not
already
permitted
in
the
state.
however,
we
had
that
authority
even
without
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act,
as
i
mentioned
before.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that
is
correct.
that's
the
view
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
rumsey
case
which
was
recently
decided,
but
the
point
is
that
although
congress
has
the
authority
to
regulate
indian
gambling
under
its
complete
authority
under
the
indian
commerce
clause,
they
still
must
do
it
in
a
way
that
is
constitutional
and
is
permissible,
and
our
position
is
that
there
are
a
myriad
of
ways
that
could
have
been
done
properly
that
were
suggested
in
the
court's
opinion
in
new
york
v.
united
states.
there
are
a
myriad
of
ways
that
the
congress
can
cajole
the
states,
or
give
them
the
opportunity
to
take
action
like
this,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
because
there
are
right
ways
and
proper
ways
to
do
it,
that
you
can
allow
them
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
is
unconstitutional.
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that's
correct.
that's
a
violation
of
the
tenth
amendment,
which
reserves
to
the
states
their
sovereign
authorities,
and--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--that's
correct.
the
federal
government,
the
congress
in
this
situation,
has
avoided
the
political
responsibility
of
taking
charge
of
gambling
on
an
indian
reservation
and
foisted
it
upon
the
state
officials,
and
that's
a
clear
tenth
amendment
violation,
as
the
court
wrote
in
new
york
v.
united
states.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
if
the
remedy
is
to
order
the
state
to
conclude
a
contract
with
the
employees--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--i
think
that
would
violate
the
tenth
amendment.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
your
honor--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--yes.
thank
you.
[laughter]
with
regard
to
ex
parte
young,
if...
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
case
against
the
state
does
not
turn
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
we're
seeking
damages
or
prospective
relief.
that
interpretation
of
the
edelman
case
has
been
specifically
disavowed
by
this
court
in
two
cases,
cory
v.
white
and
the
pennhurst
case,
and
in
the
most
recent,
the
hess
case--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
because
there
are
situations
where
a
suit
against
a
state
official
is
an
attempt
to
invoke
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
and
to
order
the
state
to
invoke
its
sovereign
machinery
the
way
that
justice
kennedy
suggested.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
i
don't
see
it
that
way,
because
what
ex
parte...
injunctions
under
ex
parte
young
tell
the
state
official
not
to
do
that
which
he
is
not
permitted
to
do,
and
i
think
there's
a
difference
there.
and
the
other
thing
is
that
in
the
balance
that
is
that
makes
ex
parte
young
necessary,
and
mr.
rogow
referred
to
it,
that
balance
between
the
state
sovereign
immunity
and
the
vindication
of
federal
constitutional
rights,
where
the
constitution
is
being
violated,
that
balance
tips
in
favor
of
allowing
the
state
official
to
have
his
immunity
stripped
and
allowing
an
injunction
to
be
issued
against
him.
where
there
is
no
constitutional
violation,
that
balance
tips
in
favor
of
protecting
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
in
ex
parte
young,
attorney
general
young
was
being
ordered
not
to
continue
activity
that
was
deemed
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
young
and
all
of
its
progeny,
from
what
my
research
shows,
all
of
those
cases
involve
violations
of
the
constitution,
and
so
the
balance
in
those
cases
tips
toward
stripping
the
immunity.
without
the
constitutional
violation,
the
balance
tips
in
favor
of
protecting
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
in
this
case--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--your
honor,
the
language
in
some
of
the
cases
says
constitutional
or
federal
law.
however,
when
you
look
at
the
facts
of
each
one
of
those
cases,
each
one
of
them
involves
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
that--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--not
that
i've
found,
your
honor.
in
edelman
v.
jordan,
for
example,
the
illinois
public
code
set
up
a
method
of
paying
benefits
under
the
aabd
program.
the
federal
government
had
regulations
that
told
the
state
how
it
was
supposed
to
do
it.
that
conflict
between
the
two
sets
of
regulations
set
up
a
supremacy
clause
violation
allowing
for--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
i'm...
i'm
not--
[laughter]
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
i
think,
again,
it
was
the
supremacy
clause,
although
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
however,
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
sure
that
the...
and
justice
stevens...
that
the
cases
where
the
statutory
problem
is
raised
is
not
also
a
constitutional
problem.
supremacy
clause
cases
involve
conflicts
between
state
and
federal
law.
we
don't
have
a
conflict
here.
there's
no
conflict
between
state
and
federal
law.
there's
no
statute
or
regulation
of
the
state
of
florida
that's
being
alleged
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that's
true.
what...
the
use
of
ex
parte
young
in
this
situation
is
simply
an
attempt
to
circumvent
the
invalid
remedy
provided
by
congress,
and
that's
not
something
that
ex
parte
young
is
designed
to
allow.
ex
parte
young
is
designed
to
allow
the
balance
of
sovereign
immunity
versus
the
constitution
to
be
vindicated.
however,
in
this
situation
that
balance
is
not...
does
not
point
toward
allowing
a
suit
against
the
state
official.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
if--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
the
statute
as
giving
us
an
option.
it
says,
you
shall
negotiate.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
except
to
the
extent
that
if
you're
impugning
the
dignity
of
a
federal
court
by
ignoring
its
orders,
you
are
subject
to
the
full
panoply
of
the
power
of
the
federal
judge.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
we
try
not
to.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
no,
we
don't.
[laughter]
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
we
could
negotiate--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
but
the
statute
isn't
written
that
way.
the
statute
is...
if
we
negotiate
in
good
faith,
which
judge
marcus
below--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--found
that
we
had,
then
the
tribe
has
no
opportunity
to
go
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
however,
the
remedy
of
having
an
order
coming
from
a
federal
judge
ordering
us
to
conclude
a
compact...
you
see,
this
is
different
from
the
labor
relations
area,
because
in
the
labor
relations
area,
i
believe
the
order
would
be,
sit
down
and
talk,
and
you
can
still
come
to
an
impasse.
here,
the
order
is,
you
shall
conclude
a
compact
within
60
days.
that
is--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
here--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
again,
the
next
step
is
another
coercive
order
from
the
court
ordering
the
state
to
provide
its
last
best
offer
of
a
compact.
once
again,
what
if
the
state
simply
refuses
to
do
that?
are
we
simply...
is
the
court
simply
going
to
say,
well,
okay,
the
state
doesn't
want
to
play
in
this
game,
or
is
the
court
going
to
say,
you
must
obey
my
order?
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
once
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
can't
it
issue
an
order...
can't
it
issue
an
order
enforcing
its
previous
order?
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
i
think
it
is
there
explicitly.
it
says,
shall.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
that's
exactly
our
position.
we
are
ordered
to
comply
and
we
have
no
choice
in
the
matter,
and--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--if
the
statute
had
said,
you
may
negotiate
and
if
you
can't
come
to
an
agreement
then
you
may
submit
to
a
mediator,
and
if...
then
if
you
don't
submit
to
the
mediator
then
the
issue
can
go
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
if
that's
what
the
statute
said,
i
would
agree
with
you
100
percent,
but
it
simply
doesn't
say
that.
it
says,
you
shall,
and
i...
the
state--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
i
think
interpreting
shall
as
may,
being
the
son
of
an
english
teacher,
is
something
of
a
leap
as
well.
however,
the
ability
to
subject
the
state
to
suit
in
the
first
instance,
which
is
the
main
question
that's
presented
here,
raises
serious
eleventh
amendment
problems.
going
back
to
pennsylvania
v.
union
gas,
that
case,
decided
on
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
was
not
decided
simply
on
the
basis
that
the
state...
the
federal
government
has
plenary
authority.
there
was
more
to
it
than
that.
there
was
a
waiver
in
the
plan
of
convention
that
figured
into
this
fundamental...
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
federal
government
and
the
relationship
with
the
states,
so
applying
the
doctrine
from
union
gas
to
the
indian
commerce
clause
presents
problems.
in
the
cotton
petroleum
case,
the
court
recognized
that
these
are
very
different
clauses,
and
in
the
plan,
in
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
chief
justice
marshall
in
the
cherokee
nation
case
said
that
they
were
considered
completely
separately,
so
simply
importing
this
determination
that
congress
has
the
authority
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
to
the
indian
commerce
clause
i
think
is
wrought
with
difficulty.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
yes,
that
is
true,
as
long
as
we
agree
that
you
can
use
ex
parte
young
in
an
effort
to
fix
an
unconstitutional
remedy
that
the
court...
that
congress
has
created,
which
as,
you
know,
justice
scalia
indicated,
that's
not
what
ex
parte
young
is
for.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
right.
in
the
next--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
this
is
true,
and--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--the
kansas--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
you
also--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
i
really...
i
can't
speak
for
the
kansas--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--case,
but
you
are
going
to
be
faced
with
this
question
in
a
different
context
in
the
merchant
bank
case,
which
has
now
been
petitioned
for
cert,
under
section
106
of
the
bankruptcy
act...
does
congress
have
the
authority
under
the
bankruptcy
act
to
abrogate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
+/?
so
that
question
is
squarely
before
you
today.
it's
coming
up
in
other
contexts
because
of
the
holding
in
union
gas.
the
holding
in
union
gas
has
encouraged
congress
to
find
the
authority
to
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity
in
any
article
i
power,
and
that
type
of
extension
of
union
gas
is
unwarranted,
i
think,
and
in
justice
scalia's
words
in
the
dissent
in
union
gas,
that--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
actually,
in
union
gas
maybe
it
does,
since
it
was
a
4
1
4
decision.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that's
correct,
if
it
was
truly
voluntary.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
in
this--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--right,
but
the
problem
is
the
way
you're
suggesting
we
construe
the
statute
also
upsets
the
balance
that
congress
thought
it
was
creating
in
this
statute
because
the
states--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
they
could
give
the
option
to
the
state
to
be
involved
in
indian
gambling,
and
specifically...
specifically
require,
as
in
the
parden
case
specifically
require
that
if
you
want
to
be
involved
in
indian
gambling
regulation,
you
must
submit
a
waiver
to
the
constitutional
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state
so
that
we
can
assure
that
there
is
evenhanded
bargaining
at
the
bargaining
table.
that
is
not
what
this
statute
does,
though.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
yes.
the
congress
has
absolute
authority
over
the
indian
tribes
and
absolute
control
over
what
happens
on
indian
lands.
if
that
is
their
wish
to
create
that
kind
of
a
regulatory
structure,
that
is
within
their
power.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
depending
on
how
broadly
the
opinion
is
written--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
thank
you,
your
honor.
