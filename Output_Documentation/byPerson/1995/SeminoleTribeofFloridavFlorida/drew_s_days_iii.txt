mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
court
has,
in
a
number
of
decisions,
recognized
that
the
ex
parte
young
doctrine
strikes
an
uneasy
balance
between
the
interest
in
respecting
state
sovereignty
on
the
one
hand
while
on
the
other
vindicating
federally
afforded
rights.
it
is
an
effort
to
give
life
to
the
supremacy
clause.
we
think
that
the
ex
parte
young
doctrine
can
be
used
effectively
by
this
court
to
support
what
congress
has
done
in
attempting
to
address
a
very
difficult
question
over
class
iii
gaming
on
indian
lands.
what
we
have
here
is
a
federally
imposed
duty,
and
let
me
underscore
the
fact
that
the
federally
imposed
duty
upon
the
state
is
to
negotiate
in
good
faith.
it
in
no
way
requires
a
state
to
commit
its
resources,
or
its
regulatory,
or
its
legislative
institutions
to
carrying
out
a
federal
program--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--only
if
the
state
wishes
to
get
to
the
point
where
it
enters
into
a
compact.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
could
the
united
states?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
the
united
states
could
require
that
there
be
a
meeting
to
discuss
that
issue,
which
is
what
is--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
that
what
we
would
have
there
would
be
a
tenth
amendment
problem,
where
in
effect
what
the
government
was
doing
was
placing
the
state
in
a
position
where
it
was
being
coerced.
there's
no
coercive
effect
under
igra
with
respect
to
the
state's
involvement.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
once
again,
there's
a
question
of
whether
there's
a
dragging
in
here,
but
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
congress
has
a
responsibility
to
see
to
the
development
of
economic
self
sufficiency
on
the
part
of
tribes
that
they
are
able
to
maintain
their
well
being,
and
that
there
are
strong
tribal
governments.
this
arrangement
allows
the
tribes
and
the
states
to
sit
down
and
talk
about
these
issues.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
all
it
does
is
invite
the
state
to
negotiate.
if
the
state
does
not
wish
to
participate--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
the
direction
is
that
they
sit
down,
and--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--allow
these
issues
to
be
aired
between
the
state
and
the
tribe.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
not
under
igra.
there's
no
indication
that
congress
has
exercised
that
authority.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
that
that
would
be
possible,
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
what
remedy
is
available?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
remedy
available
here
is
an
order
from
the
court
that
says
that
there
has
been
or
has
not
been
negotiation
in
good
faith.
the
consequence
of
that
is
that,
as
my
brother
has
indicated,
if
the
determination
is
that
the
state
has
negotiated
in
good
faith,
then
the
tribe
cannot
have
class
iii
gaming
without
agreeing
to
what
the
state
has
proposed.
if
it's
found
that
the
state
did
not
negotiate
in
good
faith,
then
the
state
gradually
loses
its
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
process.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
it's...
what,
in
fact,
congress
has
done
in
a
sense
is
codify
the
ex
parte
young
approach.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
so
does
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
this
court
in
its
ex
parte
young
jurisprudence
has
indicated
that
as,
for
example,
in
home
telephone
and
telegraph--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
states
act
through
persons.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
well--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
we
certainly
support
the
view
that
the
abrogation
by
congress
of
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
a
very
clean
and,
we
think--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--proper
way
of
resolving
this
case--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--but
this
court
has
under
some
circumstances
looked
at
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
and
decided
that
a
proper
balance
can
be
struck
more
effectively
by
using
the
ex
parte
young
approach.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
answer
is
no,
but
in
those
instances
where
the
court
has
not
been
clear
as
to
exactly
what
congress
intended,
or
had
some
doubt
about
the
effectiveness
of
what
congress
had
in
mind,
it
has
resorted
to
the
ex
parte
young
approach.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no.
i
think
that
it
is
a
matter
of
state
determination,
state
law
determination
as
to
who
has
the
authority
to
negotiate
under
these
circumstances,
and
igra
would
simply
respond
to
that
state
determination.
the
process
begins
by--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
that's
not
the
case.
the
case
is
that
other
parties--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
ex
parte
young
doesn't
require
that
the
governor
be
sued.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
that
it
is
a
way
of
suing
that
official
who
has
the
authority
to
sit
down
and
negotiate.
whether
that
person--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
know
of
no
situation
where
that
has
been--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--but
i
do
know
situations,
and
this
court
has
had
many,
where
the
suit
has
been
against
a
state
official
with
the
understanding
that
the
only
way
the
rights
could
be
vindicated
were
by
legislative
action
within
the
state,
and
that
particular
factor
was
not
viewed
as
any
impediment
to
rely
upon
the
ex
parte
young
doctrine.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
that's
correct.
that
would
be
the
approach.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
thank
you
very
much.
