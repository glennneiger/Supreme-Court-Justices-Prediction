unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
would
the
indian
tribes
lose
by
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit
here?
they
would
still...
they'd
get
regulations
coming
from
the
secretary,
which
is
what
congress
could
have
given
them
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
that
the
tribes
can
go
directly
to
the
secretary?
as
i
recall
the
secretary
is
supposed
to
make
his
decision
based
on
the
negotiating
positions
of
the
parties,
which
precede
that
step
in
the
legislation.
so
there
being
no
negotiating
position,
what
makes
you
think
that
that
section
of
the
act
subsists
when
the
portion
providing
for
suit
against
the
states
falls?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
necessarily...
do
you
or
do
you
not
support
the
proposition
that
even
if
you
can't
sue
the
states,
nonetheless
the
rest
of
the
act
stands
and
the
secretary
can
promulgate
regulations?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
would.
[laughter]
what,
may
i
ask,
could
be
done
if
a
state
just
refused,
flat
refused
to
negotiate?
is
there
any
contempt
power
against
the
state,
or
anything
of
that
kind?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
all.
it
just
means
you
get
to
the
secretary.
there
isn't
any
other
consequence,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
so
is
there
even
a
case
or
controversy,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
have
a
case
or
controversy
if
two
people
disagree
as
to
whether
the
sky
is
blue.
one
person
says
it's
cloudy,
and
the
other
one
says
it's
blue.
i
mean,
that's
a
controversy,
but
it's
not
a
case
or
controversy
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
there
have
to
be
some
consequences
that
a
court
can
impose,
do
there
not?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
consequences
that
the
court
can
impose?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
finding
now
in
this
very
case
to
the
effect
that
the
state
acted
in
good
faith?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow--
--and
that
finding
is
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
that
leaves
the
question
why
florida
is
so
interested
in
having
the
jurisdiction,
but
that's,
i
guess,
not
for
you
to
answer.
let
me
ask
you
this.
could
congress,
without
a
constitutional
bar,
impose...
give
the
power
to
the
district
court
to
hold
the
state
in
contempt
for
failure
to
negotiate
in
good
faith?
unknown
speaker
what
doubt
is
there,
if
there's
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
and
who
is
held
in
contempt
in
that
instance,
mr.
rogow?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
when
you
were
laying
out
the
alternatives,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
third
one
that
you
didn't
get
to,
and
i'm
having
the
difficulty
some
of
my
colleagues
did
in
seeing
how
you're
not
better
off
without
this
scheme.
one
scenario
is
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said.
that
is,
you're
free
of
any
obligation
to
deal
with
the
state.
you
just
deal
with
the
secretary
of
interior.
the
other
is,
that's
not
the
scheme
congress
wanted,
so
the
whole
statute
falls,
and
then
where
does
that
leave
the
tribe?
suppose
there
is
no
gaming
regulatory
act
because
it
can't
work
the
way
congress
wanted
it
to
work.
what
then
governs?
unknown
speaker
the
indians.
unknown
speaker
so
aren't
they
even
better
off
losing?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
really
defending
congress
more
than
you
are
the
tribe
in
the
position
you're
presenting,
because
the
tribe,
i
assume,
would
rather
be
free
of
any
regulation,
and
if
it
has
to
be
subject
to
some
regulation,
it
would
rather
have
just
one
instead
of
two
regulators.
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
also
rely
on
that
union
gas
case?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
take
the
position
that
this
could
also
be
decided
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
and
union
gas?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
understand
the
union
gas
case
to
stand
for,
mr.
rogow?
unknown
speaker
and
it
doesn't
stand
for
anything
more
than
that,
does
it,
because
there
was
no
opinion
for
the
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
a
negative
indian
commerce
clause.
it's
all
there,
really.
unknown
speaker
it's
actually
written
down.
unknown
speaker
no
limitations
as
to
their
power
over
indians,
not
over
states.
they
don't
agree
that...
there's
no
limitation
of
congress'
power
over
the
states.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there's
a
difference
between
assigning
powers
and
functions
between
the
two
branches
of
government,
in
this
case
all
to
the
national
government,
and
from
going
the
further
step
of
saying
that
this
allows
the
national
government
to
order
the
states
to
invoke
their
political
processes
in
behalf
of
a
national
goal.
i
simply
know
of
no
precedent
for
that,
unless
you
can
show
me
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
maybe
something
the
states
disagree
with.
they're
being
asked
to
invoke
their
official
processes,
their
official
political
machinery
in
pursuit
of
a
goal
that
they
may
not
agree
with,
and
i
know
of
no
precedent
for
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
both
the
eleventh...
the
eleventh
amendment
and
tenth
amendment
seem
to
merge
somewhat
in
this
area,
and
i
have
a
problem
under
ex
parte
young,
too,
because
it
seems
to
me
that,
unlike
young,
where
you're
asking
the
state
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
a
certain
action,
here
you
are
commanding
the
state
to
invoke
its
formal
machinery,
and
that's
not
young,
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
somewhat
the
difference
in
mandatory
and
prohibitory
injunctions
which
is
not
particularly
satisfactory,
but
here...
in
young,
the
only
federal
duty
was
not
to
interfere
with
a
right,
and
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
you
must
participate
in
this
scheme.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
rogow.
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
state
law
required
that
all
compacts
be
ratified
by
the
legislature.
then
it
would
have
the
effect
that
you
say
it
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i...
the
court
can
command
the
state
to
do
this.
could
the
united
states
command
the
state
of
california
to
negotiate
with
it
for
the
location
of
a
military
base,
enforceable
by
a
court
order,
contempt
if
they
don't?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
held
in
contempt
if
you
don't
go
to
the
meeting?
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
kind
of
poses
the
problem
that's
here.
the
united
states
can
take
any
bit
of
land
it
wants
to
in
the
state
of
california
or
in
any
other
state
by
a
process
of
condemnation
for
a
military
base.
what
is
gained
by
requiring
as
a
matter
of
law
that
california
sit
down
to
negotiate?
i
mean,
if
they
negotiate
they
may
be
able
to
get
a
better
deal
for
themselves
than
trying
the
question
of
value
to
a
jury,
but
what
is
gained
by
simply
dragging
them
into
a
process
where
they
really
don't
have
much
leverage?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
state
says,
i'm
not
going
to...
i
don't
want
to
talk,
and
the
tribes
can
go
directly
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
what
is
gained
by
saying,
even
if
you
don't
want
to
talk,
you
have
to
talk,
even
though
you
won't
get
anywhere,
and
we
have
superior
power
anyway
if
you
can't
reach
an
agreement?
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
invite,
it
commands.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
commands
them
to
sit
down.
unknown
speaker
could
you
hold
the
state
in
contempt
for
refusal
to
negotiate,
in
your
view,
if
congress
provided
that
sanction?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
could
congress
constitutionally
enact
a
statute,
or
amend
the
statute
to
require
that
federal
courts
hold
governors
in
contempt
who
don't
go
to
the
meeting?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
would
follow
from
your
position.
unknown
speaker
general
days,
what
remedy
do
you
say
is
available
under
ex
parte
young
here?
unknown
speaker
yes,
what--
unknown
speaker
--you
mean,
you
then...
you
just
use
ex
parte
young
for
that
initial
failure
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
and
then
you
go
over
to
the
rest
of
the
statute
from
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
doesn't.
i
mean,
the
fact
is
that
congress
could
have
used
language
that
summons
up
ex
parte
young,
but
it
really
speaks
of
initiating
a
cause
of
action
requesting
the
state
to
enter
into
negotiations,
and
it
constantly
says...
refers
to
the
state.
if
the
state
and
the
indian
tribe
fail
to
conclude.
it's
not
using
ex
parte
young
language
at
all.
unknown
speaker
sure,
but--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
we
must
never
forget,
it's
a
constitution
we're
construing
when
we're
talking
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
you
don't
expect
it
to
be
in
the
detail
that
a
statute
is,
but
this
is
a
very
detailed
statute,
and
it
refers
to
a
state
and
the
indian
tribe,
and
it
seems
to
me
just
contrary
to
the...
you
pull
in
ex
parte
young,
as
our
opinions
say,
when
there's
no
other
way
to
achieve
vindication
of
the
federal
interest.
it's...
in
fact,
however,
congress
has
specified
how
in
its
view
the
federal
interest
was
to
be
vindicated,
and
it
seems
to
me
it
was
by
suit
against
the
state.
that's
either
good
or
bad.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it's
bad,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
are
free
under
ex
parte
young
to
invent
a
different
way
of
vindicating
that
interest.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
if--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
congress
has
made
the
legislative
determination
that
the
matter
should
proceed
by
a
suit
against
the
state
and
we
say,
well,
that
may
be
unconstitutional,
or
it
is
unconstitutional,
but
we
will
let
you
instead,
despite
what
congress
provided,
proceed
by
a
suit
against--
unknown
speaker
--and
what
do
you
do
in
the
case
that
we're
holding
for
this
case,
where
ex
parte
young
will
not
give
you
jurisdiction
over
the
only
body
that
is
authorized
to
negotiate
the
contract?
i
understand
that
to
be
the
situation
in
the
kansas
case,
where
the
compact
can
only
be
made
by
the
legislature.
is
that...
are
we
going
to
rehear
this
same
argument
for
that
case,
and
having
used
ex
parte
young
to
get
rid
of
this
one,
then
decide
for
the
next
case
what
other
theory
might--
unknown
speaker
--so
there's
no
remedy
so
long
as
the
state
does
not
allow
its
governor
to
enter
into
a
compact,
is
that
what
it
comes--
unknown
speaker
--under
ex
parte
young,
i
mean.
under
ex
parte
young.
unknown
speaker
can
you
sue
the
legislature
under
ex
parte
young?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
legislature.
the
legislature
approves
compacts.
can
you
sue
the
legislature
under
ex
parte
young?
unknown
speaker
gee,
i'd
be
amazed
if
you
could
sue
the
legislature.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
pick...
in
effect
you
would
pick
an
appropriate
state
negotiator,
or
an
appropriate
state
official
to
sue
as
a
negotiator
in
kansas,
and
you
would
perfectly
well
understand
that
that
gets
the
statutory
process
going,
even
if
it
would
ultimately...
even
if
there
would
ultimately
be
no
compact
on
the
theory
that
the
legislature
wouldn't
accept
what
the
official
had
negotiated.
unknown
speaker
like
howell
v.
mccormick,
only
you'd
have
some
stand
in
for
the
state
legislature,
like
the
doorkeeper.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
days.
mr.
glogau.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
unknown
speaker
glogau.
mr.
glogau.
unknown
speaker
mr.
glogau,
would
you
explain
from
your
perspective
why
it
makes
sense
for
florida
to
be
opposing
this
scheme
when
the
alternative
seems
to
be
no
role
for
the
state
at
all?
isn't
it
true
that
before
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act
the
states
were
out
of
this
picture
because
of
this
court's
precedent?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
stop
the
kind
of
activity,
assuming
that
it
meets
all
your
other
laws
that
are
otherwise
applicable,
you
can't
say,
no
casino
on
this
reservation.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
fact
question...
well,
that's
a
question
on
which
you're
divided,
what
permission
means.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
event,
to
the
extent
that
gambling
is
permitted
in
florida,
the
state
could
have
no
control
over
what
is
done
on
the
reservation,
so
how
are
you
aided
by
getting
out
of
this
process?
unknown
speaker
i
had
thought
from
your
brief
that
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
was
simply
because
floridians
are
proud--
[laughter]
--and
we'd
rather
have
the
federal
government
write
the
law
than
to
have
us
pretend
to
write
it
as
a
flunky
of
the
federal
government,
subject
ultimately
to
overruling
by
the
federal
government
anyway.
isn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
floridians
are
proud.
unknown
speaker
i
would
understand
that
if
they
weren't
also
practical.
the
point
is--
[laughter]
--you
did
begin
to
negotiate,
and
then
saying...
i
thought,
well,
why
isn't
this
just
like
the
spending
cases,
the
carrot?
if
the
state
takes
it,
it's
got
to
play
by
the
federal
rules.
here,
you
didn't
have
to
negotiate,
or
at
least
that
could
be
the
state's
position.
unknown
speaker
but
you
once...
you
were
in
negotiation.
then
you
reached
an
impasse.
unknown
speaker
but
florida
doesn't
accept
that
under
your
argument,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
it
this
way,
that
if
you
want
a
role
in
this
process,
then
you
opt
into
this
regime.
if
you
don't
want
a
role
in
it,
then
you
just
stay
out
of
it,
and
then
the
federal
regulation
will
take
over,
or
there
will
be
no
regulation
and
congress
will
write
a
new
statute.
but
once
you
opt
into
it,
then
why
aren't
you
stuck
by--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
what
happens
if
you
don't?
unknown
speaker
it's
your
position
that
it
does
have
that
power,
then.
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position
that
the
federal
court
would
have
that
power
over
florida
if
the
statute
is
valid.
unknown
speaker
right,
no
question
about
young,
but
you're
saying
if,
in
fact,
there
is
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
or
any
other
theory,
the
state
itself
could
be
held
in
contempt.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
would
think
you
wouldn't
want
to
take
that
position.
[laughter]
i
mean,
this
might
occur,
and
i
can't
imagine
that
you'd
want
to
stand
here
and
advocate
that
the
state
can
be
held
in
contempt
under
this
scheme,
which
doesn't
provide
for
it
at
all.
that's
not
this
scheme.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
are
no
teeth
in
it.
the
consequence
of
not
acting
by
the
state
is,
it
gets
to
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
acts.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
very
peculiar
statute--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
think
we'd
have
to
ask
congress
about
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
this
law
was
passed
at
the
urging
of
some
states
that
wanted
to
have
some
say
in
this
process,
and
under
our
jurisprudence
here
they
in
fact
had
no
say,
and
as
justice
ginsburg
has
been
discussing
with
you,
to
engage
in
the
process
gives
the
states
a
lot
more
than
they
would
have
if
we
say
the
law
is
invalid.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
it's
already
been
decided
that
florida
negotiated
in
good
faith.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
sit
to
decide
abstract
questions
of
sovereign
immunity.
i
mean,
there
has
got
to
be
some
real
life
consequences.
what's
the
present
status
of
the
finding
that
you
negotiated
in
good
faith?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
is
there
an
interest
that
the
state
and
its
governor
has
in
1)
not
participating
in
a
regime
that
they
consider
an
unconstitutional
violation
of
the
federal
scheme
and
2)
that
the
governor
has
an
interest
in
not
authorizing
gambling
which
is
prohibited
by
his
state.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
you
have
it
under
the
statute
as
well?
doesn't
the...
isn't
it
your
view
that
the
statute
merely
authorizes
indian
gaming
that
the
state
also
authorizes?
that's
your
view
of
the
statute,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
being
required
to
negotiate
is
itself
a
harm
to
the
state,
regardless
of
whether,
down
at
the
end
of
the
road,
if
you
fail
to
do
that
there
are
other
harmful
consequences.
that,
in
and
of
itself,
is
a
harm.
unknown
speaker
not
the
least
of
those
harms
being
that
if
a
gambling
establishment
is
instituted,
it
ought
to
be
very
clear
that
it
was
done
by
the
federal
government
without
the
participation
of
the
states
if
the
states
object.
unknown
speaker
if,
in
fact,
congress
passed
a
statute
which
said
states
in
certain
instances
will
recognize
labor
unions
among
their
employees,
and
the
state
government
will,
in
the
case
of
a
disagreement,
negotiate
in
good
faith
before
anyone
goes
out
on
strike
or
lockout,
and
that
in
your
view
would
violate
the
tenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
and
they
couldn't
turn
it
over
to
the
labor
board
and
say
you
will,
in
fact,
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
issue
an
order,
require
bargaining
in
good
faith.
unknown
speaker
okay.
my
other
question
which
i
wanted
to
ask
was...
you
started
off
on
this,
and
i'd
appreciate
you
getting
back
to
it,
which
was
this
problem
of
ex
parte
young.
to
focus
it
a
little
bit,
i
thought
that
maybe
ex
parte
young
does
make
the
eleventh
amendment
mostly
a
formal
requirement.
it
says,
you
can
go
sue
the
officer.
they're
all
suits
against
the
state
in
reality,
aren't
they?
but
it
reserves
one
area
where
you
can't,
and
that's
the
area
where
the
treasury
is
involved.
so
to
look
at
it
naively,
you'd
say
yes,
ex
parte
young
says
sue
the
officer,
not
the
state.
they're
all
suits
against
the
state
in
reality.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
what
it
says,
it's
there,
and
so
i
could
understand
a
reading
of
it
which
says,
sure,
go
sue
the
officer
except
where
the
treasury
is
involved,
because
that's
too
much
the
state.
now,
if
i...
what's...
i'm
putting
this
so
that
you
can
tell
me
why
that's
wrong
and
argue
against
it--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
where
you
wanted
to
go,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
they
left
a
little
curlicue
on
that,
but...
which
i
don't
think
is
relevant
here,
or
maybe
it
is,
but
why
shouldn't
you
view
it
basically
that
way,
with
the
little
curlicue
of
pennhurst,
which
was
pendant
jurisdiction,
et
cetera?
unknown
speaker
they're
all
that.
isn't
ex
parte
young
all
that?
it's
telling
a
state
officer,
you
go
in
your
capacity
as
state
officer
and
follow
the
federal
law.
follow
the
federal
constitution,
follow
a
federal
statute,
do
that
which
federal
law
tells
the
state
to
do.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
young
applied
to
violations
of
statutes
and
regulations
as
well
as
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
you
say
there
are
no
ex
parte
young
line
of
cases
that
involve
a
statute
and
not
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
there's
a
supremacy
clause
issue--
--whenever
a
state
disobeys
a--
--if
that's--
--there's
a
supremacy
clause--
--the
constitutional
provision
you're
relying
on,
then
there
is
a
line
of
statutory
cases.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
provision
in
young,
other
than
the
supremacy
clause?
i
haven't
read...
if
it...
wasn't
young
arguing
about
tariff
rates?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
think
it--
unknown
speaker
--there
will
be
before
the
suit
commences.
that
is,
the
federal...
the
state
will
not
be
negotiating
in
good
faith
as
federal
law
requires.
i
thought
that
your
major
point
about
ex
parte
young
was
simply
that
ex
parte
young
is...
has
not
been
applied
as
a
substitute
for
a
statute
which
on
its
face
authorizes
suit
against
the
state.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question,
because
i
must
confess
i
have
some
difficulty
seeing
why
both
of
you
wouldn't
be
better
off
if
your
opponent
won
when
you
get
all
through
with
the
case.
[laughter]
and
so
it's
a
little
tricky,
but
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
the
political
responsibility
for
the
decisions,
and
florida
has
an
interest
in
not
being
forced
to
take
political
responsibility
for
something
that
the
federal
government
wants
to
impose
on
the
parties.
but
don't
you
avoid
that
simply
by
just
staying
out
of
the
process
entirely,
just
saying
i
won't
negotiate?
don't
you
then
end
up
with
the
clear
identification
of
the
political
actor
who's
responsible
for
the
end
product,
namely
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
have
an
option
to
either
take
responsibility,
or
let
the
federal
government
have
the
responsibility?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
tells
what
happens
if
you
don't,
and
the
things
that
happen
if
you
don't
end
up
by
letting
the
federal
government
run
the
show.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
you're
not,
you're
violating
a
valid
federal
law.
i
assume
floridians
don't
go
around
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
the
suggestion
that
was
just
made
to
you
suggests
that
florida
should
knowingly
violate
a
valid
federal
law.
florida
doesn't
do
that
sort
of
thing,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
can
negotiate
in
good
faith,
quite
reasonably
just
disagree
with
the
outcome,
and
then
the
political
responsibility
would
end
up
for
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
could
negotiate
and
say
we
want
no
title
iii
gambling
other
than
that
which
we
already
permit
in
other
parts
of
the
state,
and
they
may
say
they
want
more.
you
have
a
perfectly
reasonable
position.
you
insist
on
it,
it
fails,
then
the
end
result
of
the
process
is
the
federal
government
would
decide
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
that
is
the
way
it
would
come
out.
unknown
speaker
said
you'd
done--
unknown
speaker
--the
statute
says,
and
if
you
don't,
then
there's
this
mediator,
and
then
there's
the
secretary--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
statute
really
isn't
saying,
you
must
conclude
a
contract.
it's
saying,
you've
got
60
days
to
do
it,
and
if
you
don't
do
it,
then
we
go
on
to
these
further
steps.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
no
lawsuit
for
that.
the
only
lawsuit,
as
i
understand
it,
is
over
the
duty
to
negotiate
in
good
faith.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
we
read
the
statute
to
avoid
any
clash
by
simply
saying,
and
then
if
the
state
doesn't
submit
its
order,
the
mediator
has
just
one
order
before
it,
and
so
that's...
why
would
we
want
to
imply
further
coercion
into
the
statute
when
it's
not
there
explicitly?
unknown
speaker
it
says,
shall
order.
it
says,
the
court
shall
order
the
state
and
the
indian
tribe
to
conclude
such
a
compact.
unknown
speaker
then
if
you
think
the
statute
is
valid,
i
assume
you
would
have
no
choice,
if
you're
law
abiding,
except
to
do
what
the
statute
says
you
are
ordered
to
do.
i
don't
really
think
you
have
an
option
to
not
do
it
and
then
no
harm
ensues,
unless
you're
a
scofflaw.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
read
what
congress
wrote,
congress
said
shall,
and
then
it
said,
but
if
you
don't,
then
we
have
another
means
of...
it
doesn't
say
you
shall
do
it...
but
then
it
doesn't
say
the
court
will
hit
you
over
the
head
or
fine
you
or
anything.
you
shall,
but
if
you
don't,
then
a
mediator
will
decide,
and
if
there's
nothing
for
the
mediator
to
decide,
the
secretary
will
decide,
so
there's
no
teeth
at
all
into
you
shall
reach
an
agreement.
if
you
don't
reach
an
agreement,
nothing
happens.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
open
to
us
to
construe
the
word
shall
to
mean
may,
because
it's
the
only
way
the
whole
statute
makes
any
sense,
to
avoid
this
terrible
constitutional
problem
here
we're
being
asked
to
submit
an
offer?
it
really
doesn't
seem
to
me
there's
much
at
stake
here.
you
figure
out
what
the
best
deal
you
could
possibly
go
along
with
this,
and
you
put
it
on
paper,
and
you--
--it
isn't
really
just
shall
may.
you'll
have
to
interpret
order
to
mean,
instead
of
the
court
shall
order
the
state,
you'll
say
the
court
shall
invite
the
state.
we
have
to
interpret
order
to
mean
invite,
which
is
something
of
a
leap.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
ex
parte
young
fits
here,
then
i
guess
we
wouldn't
have
to
even
address
union
gas.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
might
not
have
to
use
it
in
this
case,
with
the
exception
you've
just
mentioned,
but
in
the
next
case
we
might
have
to
go
beyond
ex
parte
young.
unknown
speaker
that
is
to
say,
in
the
case
where
there
is
no
officer
who
can
be
sued
who
has
the
authority
to
conclude
the
compact.
unknown
speaker
like
in
kickapoo--
unknown
speaker
--kansas
v.
kickapoo,
or
something
of--
unknown
speaker
--so
we
would
dodge
the
bullet
for
one
day,
or
one
term.
unknown
speaker
if
we
had
to
take
that
case.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
take
it
that
the
indians
are
satisfied
with
their
remedy
in
that
case
they
won,
and
i
take
it
in
the
future
they'll
all
sue
the
officers.
is
there
any
reason...
i
mean,
i
know
this
is
going
beyond
this,
but
i
wondered
if
you
have
any--
unknown
speaker
--no.
unknown
speaker
dissents
don't
count
for
a
lot.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
glogau,
i
think
we
can
find
that
language,
but
from
your
perspective,
if
this
whole
thing
were
voluntary
on
florida's
part,
here's
the
machinery,
if
you
want
to
negotiate,
negotiate,
if
you
don't
want
to,
this
is
what
happens,
that
would
be
all
right.
there'd
be
no
eleventh,
tenth
amendment
problem,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
it
also
would
give
the
state
no
clout.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
tribe
can
then
say,
forget
it.
we're
not
interested.
unknown
speaker
we'll
get
a
better
deal
from
the
secretary.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
way
that
congress
can
give
the
states
a
role
in
this
that
would
work?
unknown
speaker
could
congress
also
provide
that
there
shall
be
no
gambling
unless
the
state
of
its
own
will
makes
a
compact
with
the
indians?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just...
i'm
really
having
trouble
sorting
all
this
out,
because
it
is
a
complicated
statute,
but
if
you
should
prevail
and
we
buy
everything
you've
argued
as
correct,
would
that
nullify...
as
a
practical
matter
nullify
the
entire
statute
and
put
you
back
in
the
pre
1988
law?
unknown
speaker
by
every
argument
you
made.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
would
hurt
you.
it
really
does.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
glogau.
mr.
rogow,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but
congress
doesn't
have
sovereignty
over
the
states.
that
is
simply
fundamentally
wrong
under
the
constitution.
the
states
are
separate,
autonomous
sovereignties
within
their
sphere.
unknown
speaker
congress
doesn't
order
states
to
do
something.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
if
you
want
to
amend
your
statement
that
subject
to
any
tenth
amendment
reservation
congress
might
have
some
power
over
the
states,
fine,
but
that's
not
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
if
there's
no
compulsion,
why
worry
about
abrogating
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
might
well
gain
in
this
case
if
we
found
against
them,
but
they're
looking
down
the
road,
and
the
principles
that
this
case
would
establish
as
to
what
the
federal
government
can
order
the
states
to
do,
and
as
to
when
the
federal
government
can
permit
the
states
to
be
sued,
are
important
issues.
they're
looking
beyond
indian
gaming
laws.
unknown
speaker
what
precedent
is
that?
unknown
speaker
was
that
involved
in...
was...
did
morales
discuss
in
any
detail
the
ex
parte
young
aspect
of
that
case?
unknown
speaker
but
not
the
vehicle
for
patching
up
a
broken
statute,
which
says
you
sue
the
state.
it
wasn't
the
vehicle...
say
well,
it
says
the
state,
but
we're
going
to
use
ex
parte
young
instead.
that's
quiet
a
different
thing.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjurned
until
monday
october
sixteenth
at
ten
o'clock.
