justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you,
it's
really
not
discrimination
against
commerce
as
it's
discrimination
against
those
who
own
stock
that...
the
company
of
which
does
business
elsewhere.
it's
discrimination
against
the
stock
ownership,
not
against
the
activity,
is
what
i'm
saying.
the
ownership
in
different
kinds
of
companies
is
taxed
differently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
tax
on
the
ownership
interest
in
the
company
the
tax
on
the
stock
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
here
it
is,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wasn't
in
that
case
though,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
have
we
squarely
held
that
it
would
be
impermissible
to
tax
at
a
different
rate
the
ownership
in
stock
of
a
company
that
did
its
business
in
the
state,
as
opposed
to
stock
in
a
company
that
only
did
its
business
out
of
state?
forget
all
the
gradations
of,
you
know,
half...
just
the
extreme
polar
cases.
is
that...
you
think
that's
clearly
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
closest
case
on
that
point,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
rothfeld,
could
i
ask
you
a
sort
of
preliminary
question
that
i
want
to
be
sure
i'm
right
on?
you
do
concede,
do
you
not,
that
if
the
state
repealed
its
income
tax
on
corporate
activity
and
merely
taxed
the
stock
of
the
residents
at
different
rates,
depending
on
whether
the
corporation
did
business
out
of
state
on
the
one
hand
or
was
a
local
corporation
on
the
other,
that
that
would
be
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
really
haven't
argued
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
is
it
not
clear
that
they
have
an
alternative,
either
doing
away
with
the
exemption
or
doing
away
with
the
tax?
you
could
lose,
and
you
could
win
the
legal
principle
and
lose
this
in
dollars.
