we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number

fulton
corporation
v.
janice
faulkner.
mr.
cummings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court...
are
you
saying
the
court
struck
down
the
tax
in
westinghouse
v.
tully?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
embroider,
you
mean
take
it
from
the
indiana--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
did
the
court
say
it
was
deciding
in
darnell?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it
didn't
say
that
in
the
abstract.
i
mean,
if
the
state
couldn't
do
it,
it
would
have
to
be
some
provision
of
the
constitution
that
would
prevent
it.
what
provision
of
the
constitution
did
the
court
say
was
involved
in
darnell?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
not
equal
protection,
even
fourteenth
amendment.
that's
due
process,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
it...
is
there
any
mention
of
equal
protection
in
the
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
there's
a
graded
scale?
is
he
supposed
to
find
out
for
himself
whether
the
shares
he
owns
are
of
an
out-of-state
corporation
or
in-state,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
slow
down
a
little
bit,
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cummings,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cummings.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
