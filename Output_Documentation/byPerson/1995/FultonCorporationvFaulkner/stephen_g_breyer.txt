justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--was
capital
stock
a
net
or
gross?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
if
they
had
liabilities,
did
they
subtract
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
subtracted
liabilities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
therefore
in
almost
every
case
the
gross...
if
there's
goodwill
in
the
company,
and
unless
in
an
unusual
circumstance
except
for
that,
then
the
value
of
the...
the
total
value
of
the
stock
will
be
greater
than
the
intangible
or
tangible
property...
the
tangible
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
almost
every
case,
what
they're
really
paying
tax
on
in
the
corporation
is
the
stock.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
didn't
you
do
the
same
thing
with
the
whiskey
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
people
out
of
state
don't
pay
the
whiskey
tax--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
foreign
corporations
don't
pay
tolls.
i
suppose
the
reason
they
don't
pay
income
tax
in
north
carolina
is
they
don't
have
income
in
north
carolina,
nor
do
they
buy
whiskey
in
north
carolina,
nor
do
they
use
north
carolina
bridges,
so
i
mean,
that's
obviously
the
thing
that's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
you're
saying
that
the
ones
that
do
business
in
north
carolina
pay
an
income
tax
to
north
carolina,
and
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
make
up
for
the
fact
that
the
people
who
don't
do
business
in
north
carolina,
unfortunately
north
carolina
will
lose
that
income
for
the
income
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
problem
that
i
have
with
that
is
not
the
technical
thing,
it's
just
the
practical
thing.
of
course
north
carolina
loses
the
income
tax
of
a
california
company.
so
do
they
lose
the
whiskey
tax.
so
do
they
lose
a
lot
of
things.
if
we
were
to
uphold
this,
wouldn't
we
have
to
say
a
state
could
impose
some
kind
of
tax
on
a
maine
company
to
make
up
for
the
fact
that
its
employees
don't
buy
whiskey
in
north
carolina?
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
try
once
more.
could
you
assess
a
tax
on
shares
in
north
carolina
of
a
foreign
company
to
make
up
for
the
fact
that
that
foreign
company
has
employees
who
don't
buy
food
in
north
carolina
so
they
don't
pay
the
sales
tax,
to
make
up
for
the
fact
that
they
don't
use
bridges
in
north
carolina?
you
see--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
i
accept
your
principle,
wouldn't
i
also
have
to
accept
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because.
i
think
that
the...
what
we
visualize
this
tax
as
being,
we
visualize
corporate
shares
and
corporate
income
as
having
a
particular
relationship,
just
as
corporate
shares
and
perhaps
corporate
property
do.
we
don't
think
that
corporate
shares
and
the
food
purchases
of
the
corporation's
employees
have
that
relationship.
we
don't
think
that
that's
what
corporate
shares
represent,
or
were
understood
to
represent
when
the
state
passed
this
test.
what
we
think
the
shares
represent
are
corporate
values,
and
we
think
income
is
one
of
those
values.
well,
then
if
that
is
true,
you
could
tax
100
percent
of
the
income
of
any
corporation
regardless
of
where
its
income
was
earned--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
are
they
any
more
related
than
whiskey
is
related?
i'm
sorry
to
go
back
to
that,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
that
you
don't
have
an
income
tax
on
california
companies
in
north
carolina
is
because
the
california
companies
don't
have
income
in
north
carolina.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
discounted
value
of
a
future
income
stream,
and
some
of
that
income
stream
will
be
taxed
when
it
reaches
a
north
carolina
person,
and
the
other
is
taxed
in
the
form
of
an
income
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
north
carolina
gets
its
share
of
that,
and
the
others
get
their--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
i
agree
that's
what
it
represents.
you
don't
have
to...
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
beginning
to
see
something
in
what
you
say,
that
this
is
a...
the
state
has
a
use
tax,
say
4
percent,
on
refrigerators
bought
out
of
state.
can
it
charge
that
use
tax
if
i
go...
say
you
have
that
in
north
carolina.
i
buy
my
refrigerator
in
new
york,
and
i
have
to
pay
a
new
york
sales
tax.
do
i
have
to
pay
the
new
york
sales
tax
of
4
percent,
then
take
the
refrigerator
back
to
north
carolina
and
also
pay
the
use
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
were
so,
i
could
understand
why
you
have
this
income
tax
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
so,
or
it
is
so,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
other
argument?
if
you
want
to
finish...
are
you
finished?
