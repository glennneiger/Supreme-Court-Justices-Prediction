mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
outcome
of
this
case
will
depend
on
three
points.
first,
the
north
carolina
tax
upon
the
intangible
value
of
stock
discriminates,
both
facially
and
in
actual
operation,
against
interstate
commerce.
second,
there
is
no
defense
to
this
discrimination
either
under
the
compensating
tax
defense
or
otherwise.
thirdly,
this
case
is
not
controlled
by
the
1912
decision
in
darnell
v.
indiana.
first,
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
discrimination.
that
the
discrimination
in
the
tax
is
facial
is
admitted
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
by
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
and
by
the
state
in
its
brief
before
this
court.
were
it
not
for
that
facial
discrimination,
there
would
not
be
necessary
the
attempt
to
prove
the
compensatory
tax
defense
which
both
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
state
before
this
court
have
argued.
not
only
is
there
facial
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
but
perhaps
more
importantly,
this
tax--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
just
as
in
the
very
early
case
of
i.
m.
darnell
company,
which
in
fact
was
the
same
corporation
involved
in
the
darnell
case,
the
company
that
receives
logs
shipped
from
another
state
and
was
taxed
in
that
case
differently
from
logs
that
it
had
received
from
the
taxing
state,
while
it
might
not
have
been
the
outside
shipper
of
the
logs,
it
suffered
the
first
impact
of
discrimination.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
the
tax
at
issue
here
is
the
tax--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--on
stock,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
well,
there
it
was
a
tax
on
logs
which
were
owned
by
the
in-state
company,
but
we've
had
many
cases
before
this
court
where
the
party
who
was
objecting
before
this
court
was
not
the
party
dealing
in
interstate
commerce
but
was
just
a
local
party
who
had
dealt
with
someone
who
was
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
the
closest
case
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
believe,
is
westinghouse
v.
tully,
the
1984
decision
of
this
court
written,
i
believe,
by
justice
blackmun.
westinghouse
v.
tully
also
involved
the
tax
on
a
shareholder.
the
shareholder
in
that
case
was
westinghouse
corporation.
it
had
a
subsidiary
that
was
a
disc,
a
domestic
international
sales
corporation,
and
the
tax
at
issue
was
the
parent's
franchise
tax.
the
franchise
tax
was
computed
in
a
way
that
increased
the
parent's
franchise
tax
as
the
subsidiaries
exports
through
the
ports
of
other
states
increased.
it
didn't
matter
that
the
exports
through
the
ports
of
the
state
of
new
york
stayed
the
same,
but
if
the
subsidiary
did
more
activity
in
interstate
commerce,
the
shareholders'
franchise
tax
went
up.
we
submit
that
that
same
type
of
discrimination
exists
here.
under
the--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
the
court
struck
down
the
tax
on
the
shareholder,
which
was
a
franchise
tax
in
that
case.
so
we
have
here
both
the
facial
discrimination,
which
as
i
indicated
was
admitted
both
in
the
brief
and
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
we
have
the
actual
penalty
against
interstate
commerce,
in
that
here
the
corporation
could
do
the
same
amount
of
business
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
but
could
expand
its
business
in
interstate
commerce
and
as
a
result
of
that
the
shareholders'
stock
tax
will
go
up.
so
therefore
the
two
taxes,
the
stock
tax
which
my
client
has
paid
and
the
corporate
income
tax
which
is
said
to
be
a
compensatory
tax,
which
we
will
get
to
in
a
minute,
are
not
in
this
case
mutually
exclusive
proxies
for
each
other.
this
is
not
an
either-or
case.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
one
tax
goes
down
and
the
other
tax
goes
up.
just
as
in
westinghouse
v.
tully,
or
by
analogy
to
that,
the
tax
paid
by
the
corporation
to
north
carolina
could
remain
the
same,
the
shareholders'
tax
could
go
up
just
because
the
subsidiary
of
the
corporation
had
increased
this
interstate
commerce.
having
shown
both
actual
and
facial
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
we
turn
to
the
compensating
tax
defense
on
which
the
state
and
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
primarily
relied.
first,
it
is
important
to
notice
that
the
compensating
tax
defense
has
never
been
allowed
to
impose
an
actual
penalty
on
interstate
commerce
by
its
operation.
as
i
have
illustrated,
it
would
do
so
if
it
were
allowed
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
your
honor,
it
might
be
somewhat
invested.
i
can
say
from
personal
experience
that
i
know
from
many
persons
in
north
carolina
they
like
to
invest
in
corporations
like
cp&l,
carolina
power
&
light,
duke
power,
local
corporations
that
they
know
about,
and
it
motivates
them,
and
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
motivation...
there's
an
affidavit...
to
invest
in
a
corporation
in
which
there
will
be
less
intangibles
taxed.
there
are
many
decisions
of
this
court
stating
that
we
do
not
need
to
know
how
great
the
impact
on
interstate
commerce
is
to
strike
down
discrimination.
a
third
point,
just
2
weeks
ago,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
kentucky,
in
a
case
titled
st.
ledger,
dealt
with
a
very
similar
tax
upholding
it,
relying
on
the
darnell
case,
which
we
will
come
to
in
a
minute,
but
finding,
as
a
factual
matter,
the
very
discrimination
that
you
just
described
to
actually
occur
and
to
be
a
concern
to
that
court,
by
analogy.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
sort
of
interstate
luring
by
nontaxation
is
the
type--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--well,
up
to
this
point,
this
court's
opinions
in
that
type
of
case
have...
by
my
reading
have
looked
to
two
types
of
discrimination.
first,
is
the
imported
good
taxed
by
this
state?
let's
talk
about
the
state
of
north
carolina.
is
the
imported
car
taxed
by
north
carolina
at
the
same
rate
as
the
car
bought
locally?
if
the
answer
is
yes,
that's
the
first
cut
that
there
is
no
discrimination.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
then,
as
this
court
discussed
in
the
decision
in
jefferson
lines,
there
needs
to
be
a
credit
applied
by
this
state...
let's
say
north
carolina...
for
any
sales
tax
paid
to
the
other
state
from
which
the
car
was
imported.
when
that
credit
is
applied,
that's
the
second
cut
to
ensure
that
there
is
no
interstate
discrimination.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
perhaps
the
response
to
your
question
would
be
a
statement
that
was
made
in
armco
v.
hardesty,
which
is
a
very
important
case
to
us.
as
you
may
recall,
in
armco
v.
hardesty,
there
was
concern
about
the
fact
that
out-of-state
manufacturers
had
to
pay
the
in-state
wholesaling
tax,
but
in-state
manufacturers
only
had
to
pay
the
in-state
manufacturing
tax
and
did
not
have
to
pay
the
wholesaling
tax.
the
decision...
of
course,
that
was
struck
down.
the
decision
posited
the
situation
where
one
state
might
impose
simply
a
wholesaling
tax
and
one
state
might
impose
simply
a
manufacturing
tax,
and
the
decision
said
that
would
be
okay,
that's
not
a
discrimination,
and
i
think
that's
somewhat
analogous
to
your
situation
that
one
state
might
choose
not
to
tax
at
all,
and
another
state
might
tax.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
your
honor,
no.
i
believe
darnell...
if
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
darnell
can
be
distinguished.
if
you
choose
not
to
distinguish
it,
we
do
ask
you
to
overrule
it,
and
if
you'd
like
me
to
turn
to
darnell
now,
i
will.
darnell
is
a
very
cryptic
decision.
it's
a
decision
that
is
hard
to
understand,
and
it's
hard
to
understand
the
facts
without
resort
to
the
decision
of
the
underlying
indiana
supreme
court,
which
i've
done
and
will
embroider
a
little
bit
on
the
facts
of
darnell.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
take
it
from
the
indiana
supreme
court...
i
certainly
will
not
add
to
that...
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
important
to
notice
that
in
darnell
there
was
not
the
set
of
facts
that
we
had
here.
in
darnell,
there
was
not
a
situation
where
the
tax
paid
by
the
corporation
to
the
state
of
indiana
could
remain
level,
and
the
tax
paid
by
the
shareholder
could
increase,
because
the
corporation
had
entered
into
interstate
commerce.
that
was
not
the
way
the
regime
in
indiana
worked.
the
regime
in
indiana
was
a
true,
either-or
situation.
it
was
a
true
set
of
mutually
exclusive
taxes.
the
taxpayers
would
either
pay
one
or
the
other.
what
the
state
of
indiana
tried
to
do,
i
believe,
was
to
tax
all
stock
that
it
could
get
its
hands
on
at
100
percent.
if
the
stock
were
owned
by
a
local
resident
in
an
out-of-state
corporation,
the
state
of
indiana
made
that
local
shareholder
pay
tax
on
100
percent
of
the
value
of
the
stock
he
owned,
a
very
unremarkable
sort
of
tax,
sort
of
property
tax.
if
the
corporation
was
domestic...
and
this
is
where
the
either-or
comes
in.
if
the
corporation
was
domestic,
the
shareholder
didn't
have
to
pay
tax
on
his
stock,
but
the
corporation
paid
tax,
in
essence,
on
all
of
its
stock
as
if
it
were
paying
for
the
shareholder,
and
the
way
that
was
done
was,
the
corporation
paid
tax
on
the
greater
of
the
value
of
the
tangible
personal
property
in
indiana
that
it
owned,
or
the
capitalization
value
of
all
its
market
value
stock.
and
therefore,
justice
holmes
looked
at
this
situation
and
said,
well,
certainly
indiana
can
tax
the
stock
of
residents,
and
certainly
indiana
can
make
the
corporations
pay
tax
on
their
property,
including
their
capital
stock,
and
we
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that,
and
by
the
way,
we're
not
going
to
consider
the
situation
where
the
corporation
might
own
property
in
indiana
and
in
other
states,
because--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--gross.
well,
it
was
the
true
market
capital
value
of
the
stock.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
correct.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
that
was
my--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--is
the
stock,
right.
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
therefore
it
seems
that
indiana
was
simply
trying
to
tax
all
the
stock
in
the
state.
it
taxed
the
stock
to
the
domestic
corporate
issuer,
and
it
taxed
the
stock
to
the
local
shareholder
of
the
foreign
corporation.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
i'm
with
you
all
the
way,
justice.
i
agree
completely.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
it
really
could
be--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the
case
can
be
parsed
between
the
commerce
clause
discussion
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
discussion,
and
the
commerce
clause
discussion
falls
in
the
middle
of
the
second
paragraph,
i
believe,
where
they
said...
where
justice
holmes
said,
we're
not
dealing
with
the
case
where
a
foreign
corporation
owns
some
indiana
property,
and
property
tax
was
paid
to
the
state
of
indiana
but
there
was
no
deduction
allowed
against
the
shareholders'
stock.
he
said,
we're
not
going
to
deal
with
that,
because
they're
not
our
facts,
and
that
is
the
very
paradigm
case
that
i
stated
at
the
outset
that
represents
the
actual
penalty
here,
where
we
can
have--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--it
said
it
was
deciding,
your
honor,
whether
a
state
can
tax
the
property
of
a
domestic
corporation,
that
property
including
the
capital
value
of
its
stock,
in
the
stock
of
a
foreign
corporation.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
the
citation
follow...
well,
the
court
said
at
the
outset
of
the
opinion
that
there
had
been
a
claim
made
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
when
it
got
to
the
last
paragraph,
where
it
discussed
the
stock
tax
on
in
and
out-of-state
corporations,
it
cited
the
case
of
kidd
v.
alabama,
which
was
a
1903
decision
that
was
purely
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
kidd
v.
alabama
went
off
on
coe
v.
erroll,
and
coe
v.
erroll
was
one
of
those
early
cases
which
dealt,
again,
with
timber...
they
seemed
to
have
a
lot
of
timber
in
the
early
days...
and
it
simply
held
that
the
state
from
which
the
timber
was
cut
could
tax
the
timber,
and
then
if
the
timber
was
shipped
across
the
state
line,
the
state
where
it
was
received
could
tax
the
timber.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
both
due
process
and
to
some
extent
equal
protection.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
there's
a
mention
of
"substantial
equality".
justice
holmes
in
the
last
paragraph
said
that
substantial
equality
is
attained
by
taxing
the
stock
of
the
foreign
corporation
and
the
property
of
the
domestic
corporation,
and
i
agree
that
the
commerce
clause,
part
of
the
decision
was
really
not
decided
by
the
court
because
it
did
not
have
the
facts
before
it.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
well,
i
believe...
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
a
straw
has
already
been
put
into
the
wind
on
that
issue
in
the
jefferson
lines
decision
earlier
this
year.
it
was
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
cited
darnell
since
1935.
and
in
that
citation,
in
the
footnote
in
jefferson
lines,
the
court
was
dealing
with
giving
credit
for...
to
one
taxpayer
for
a
tax
paid
by
another
taxpayer,
or
perhaps
for
a
different
tax
paid
by
that
taxpayer,
and
this
court
said,
if
a
state
chooses
to
have
an
apportioned
gross
receipts
tax
on
a
bus
company,
and
if
it
chooses
to
give
a
credit
for
the
sales
tax
paid
to
that
state
by
the
bus
rider,
then
it
must
give
a
credit
for
out-of-state
sales
taxes
paid
by
bus
riders
that
bought
their
ticket
out
of
state.
the
last
line
in
that
footnote
said,
however,
we're
not
now
deciding...
probably
because
cert
had
been
granted
here...
we're
not
now
deciding
whether
a
similar
credit
must
be
given
to
a
tax
paid
by
a
c.
f.
darnell,
the
first
cite
of
darnell
since
the
1935
decision
in
colgate
v.
harvey.
i
think
you
were
sending
us
a
signal
that
you
saw
the
inconsistency
of
darnell
with
the
credit
mechanism
set
up
in
footnote
6
in
jefferson
lines,
and
i
say
to
you
that
your
question
about
third
party
is,
i
think,
easily
answered,
because
darnell
is
no
more
a
"third
party"...
excuse
me.
the
corporation
in
relation
to
its
shareholder
is
no
more
a
"third
party"
than
is
the
buyer
of
the
bus
ticket
a
third
party
in
relationship
to
the
bus
company.
in
fact,
there
is
an
even
closer
relationship,
because
these
are
related
parties.
these
are
corporation
and
shareholder,
and
if
the
state
chooses
to
think
that
there's
a
close
enough
relationship
that
the
state
can
create
this
sort
of
intertwining
of
the
corporate
tax
and
the
shareholder
tax,
then
certainly
this
court
can
see
that
there's
a
close
enough
relationship
to
be
concerned
about
the
impact
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we
believe--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--we
have
no
objection
to
a
tax
on
100
percent
of
the
value
of
stock
in
an
out-of-state
corporation.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
a
hundred...
if
the
state
of
north
carolina
wants
to
tax
100
percent
of
the
value
of
all
the
stock
owned
by
everybody,
that
suits
us
fine,
because--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--i
would
not
think
so,
your
honor,
and
that
question
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
question
that
was
raised
recently
in
the
perini
case
from
massachusetts
involving
the
distinction
between
how
you
were
going
to
give
a
franchise
tax
relief
for
in-state
and
out-of-state
corporations,
and
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
held
for
the
taxpayer
and
this
court
did
not
issue
certiorari,
my
closest
analogy
in
a
recent
case.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
yes--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
at
least
four.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
one
is
kentucky.
i
believe
georgia
is
another.
they
are
listed
in
the
response
of
the
state
to
our
petition.
whether--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
if
this
court
finds
for
fulton
corporation,
i
would
request
that
the
court
in
its
decision
give
some
indication
of
the
application
of
its
decision
to
the
1990
tax
year
issue.
the
reason
for
my
concern
is
that
the
only
decision
we
have
below,
which
was
a
decision
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals,
which
ruled
for
fulton
corporation
and
found
the
tax
to
be
unconstitutional,
postponed
the
effective
date
of
its
decision
for
a
year-and-a-half
after
the
date
of
the
decision,
and
therefore
fulton
corporation
received
no
remedy.
we
moved
before
that
court
for
rehearing
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
harper
v.
virginia,
which
expressed
a
very
strong
desire
for--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--i
agree,
yes--
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
--your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
make
sure
that
they...
that
the
state
makes
that
decision
either
to
do
away...
either
to
make
everyone
pay
the
full
tax
on
stock
they...
in
1990
forward,
or
to
give
refunds.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
this...
yes,
your
honor.
this
court
many
times
has
indicated
that
is
a
theoretical
possibility.
mr.
jasper
l.
cummings,
jr.
i'm
never
aware
of
that
having
actually
been
done,
and
i
would
not
expect
it
to
be
done
in
north
carolina.
i
think
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
refunds.
thank
you.
