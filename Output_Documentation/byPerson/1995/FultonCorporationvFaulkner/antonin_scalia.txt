justice

why
do
you
say
that
none
of
the
other
compensating
facts
cases
involve
any
discrimination,
discriminatory
effect
on
interstate
commerce?
i
would
think
even
the
classic
one
does.
i
mean,
that
is
the
offsetting
sales
and
use
taxes.
every
time
such
a
tax
is
imposed,
it
becomes
much
less
attractive
to
buy
a
car
in
another
state
where
there's
no
sales
tax.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
there's
a
sales
tax
in
virginia
and
no
sales
tax
in
north
carolina,
i
will
go
and
buy
my
car
in
north
carolina
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
can
call
it
luring,
but
any
difference
in
price
is
a
luring.
this
happens
to
be
a
difference
of
price
caused
by
the
imposition
of
a
sales
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
you
can
say
that
there
cannot
be
undue
interstate
discrimination,
perhaps,
no
more
than
is
necessary
to
prevent
your
higher
taxes
from
having
what
would
be
the
normal
economic
effect
of
higher
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
we
follow
that
approach
today,
that
is,
evaluate
the
tax
just
on
the
basis
of
how
it
applies
to
the
particular
petitioner
before
the
court
and
not
how
it
applies
overall?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
we've
done
that
in
the
cases
since
i've
been
sitting
here,
anyway.
it
seems
to
me
we
look
at
the
tax's
overall
impact,
so
no
matter
how
you
slice
it,
you're
asking
us
to
cut
back
on
what
we
said
in
darnell.
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
agree
with
darnell
that
the
shares
represent
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
anybody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--any
moderately
sophisticated
stock
analyst
would
value
shares
on
the
basis
of
book--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
darnell
must
be
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rothfeld,
how
many
cases
have
we
had
that
have
approved
compensating
taxes?
what
kinds
of
taxes
have
been
approved
as
compensated?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
canning
and
freezing
of
fish,
and
sales
and
use
taxes.
what
other
ones?
justice
antonin
scalia
darnell.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know,
and
these
are
substantially...
because
you
said
here
what
is
going
on
is
basically
a
tax
on
access
to
capital
markets,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
i
should
ignore
all
the
stuff
about
access
to
capital
markets.
