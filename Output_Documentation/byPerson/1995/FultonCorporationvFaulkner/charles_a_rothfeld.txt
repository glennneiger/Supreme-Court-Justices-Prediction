mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
do
you
mean
in
filing
as
individual
tax
return?
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
a
list
of
stocks
that's
maintained
by
the
state,
and
he
can
determine
that
simply
by
looking
to
that
list
to
determine
which
percentage
of
the
stock
is
taxable,
so
i
think
it's
a
fairly
routine
and
easy
mechanical
matter.
i
should
say,
i
think
that
this
case
involves
two
distinct
commerce
clause
principles.
the
first
is
the
principle
of
nondiscrimination,
which
we
think
in
this
case
turns
on
application
of
the
compensatory
tax
doctrine.
the
second
distinct
principle
is
the
principle
of
apportionment,
which
we
think
in
this
case
turns
on
the
application
of
the
internal
consistency
test,
and
i
think
it's
useful
to
keep
these
principles
straight,
and
i'll
discuss
them
separately,
starting
with
the
question
of
discrimination,
and
on
that
question,
given
some
of
the
discussion
thus
far,
i
think
it's
useful
to
begin
with
what
the
state
understood
the
relationship
to
be
between
the
income
tax
and
the
shares
tax
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
the
taxable
percentage
deduction
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
at
that
time,
before
it
enacted
the
taxable
percentage
deduction...
and
i
think
i
should
note,
as
has
been
observed,
the
taxable
percentage
deduction
and,
indeed,
the
entire
intangibles
tax,
have
been
repealed.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
oh,
i'm
sorry.
we're
so
excited
to
get
to
the
meat
of
the
case,
your
honor,
that
i'm
speeding
along.
before
the
state
enacted
the
taxable
percentage
deduction
it
entirely
excluded
corporate
shares
from
the
reach
of
the
intangibles
tax,
and
when
the
state
began
to
consider
an
expansion
revision
of
the
intangibles
tax,
it
was
of
the
view
that
intangibles
were
simply
paper
representations
of
other
values
that
might
already
be
subjected
to
other
state
taxes,
and
in
particular,
that
corporate
shares
were
representations
of
other
corporate
values
that
might
be
subjected
to
the
state
property
tax
or
income
tax,
and
when
the
state
determined
to
expand
the
intangibles
tax
to
reach
corporate
shares,
it
decided
to
try
to
avoid
duplicative
taxation
of
these
related
intrastate
values.
now,
the
state
considered
but
rejected
the
idea
of
a
discriminatory
tax
that
would
exempt
the
shares
of
domestic
while
taxing
the
shares
of
foreign
corporations,
and
instead
hit
upon
the
idea
of
the
taxable
percentage
deduction
under
which
the
shares
of
a
corporation
that
pays
income
tax
are
exempted
from
the
shares
tax,
and
the
shares
of
a
corporation
that
does
not
pay
income
tax
are
subject
to
the
intangibles
tax.
the
idea
was
to
impose
a
single,
nonduplicative
tax
on
all
related
intrastate
corporate
values.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
what
you
say
is
right,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
state's
view...
and
i'll
suggest
in
a
minute
the
state's
view
is
clearly
supported
by
the
decision
in
darnell.
the
state's
view
is
that
these
paper
representations
that
it's
trying
to
tax
are
representations
that
exist
elsewhere,
but
they're
values
that
also
are
present
in
the
state
in
the
form
of
the
corporate
shares,
and
the
states...
i
think
as
a
matter
of
economic
reality,
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
the
value
of
a
corporation's
shares
and
the
amount
of
the
corporate
income,
and
therefore
the
states
took
the
position--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
something
in
the
state
that's
taxable,
and
that's
the
corporate
shares,
and
the
corporate
shares
represent
something.
they
represent
an
ownership
interest
in
a
part
of
the
corporation,
and
there
are
various
ways
that
one
could
look
at
what
those
shares
represent.
in
darnell,
we
think
that
the
state
looked
at
it,
and
this
court--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
clearly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
we--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
clearly--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
leads
us
to
the
compensatory
tax
analysis
here.
it
certainly
is
true
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
don't
think
so.
we're...
both
of
these
taxes--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
don't--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
certainly
recognize
that
the
state
can't
tax
100
percent
of
the
income,
or
any
of
the
income
which
is
earned
outside
of
the
state,
unless
the
state
has
apportionable
taxing
nexus
to
it,
and
we're
not
trying
to
tax
the
income.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
under
the
compensatory
tax
doctrine,
related
values
that
are
present
in
the
state
and
out
of
state
may
be
subject
to
tax,
and
i
think
it's
important,
your
honor,
not
to
confuse
the
apportionment
principle
which
relates
to
credits
for
taxes
paid
elsewhere
and
the
nondiscrimination
principle,
which
relates
to
whether
or
not
the
taxable
percentage
deduction
here
must
be
struck
down
as
being
discriminatory.
now,
our
understanding
of
how
that
deduction
should
be
viewed
is
that
there
is
one...
there
are
substantially
related
values,
and
that
is
the
test
the
court
has
articulated
in
the
compensatory
tax
doctrine
cases,
that
there
are
substantially
related
values
between
the
value
of
corporate
shares
and
the
amount
of
corporate
income
as
a
matter
of
economic
reality,
and
we
think
given
that
substantial
relationship,
imposing
a
tax,
a
tax
as
a
mutually
exclusive
proxy
either
on
income,
if
income
is
taxable,
or
on
the
corporate
shares
which
represent
those
values,
that
that
does
not
impose
a
discrimination.
now,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we're
taxing
too
much
total
value,
whether
the
tax
is
on
apportionment,
is
a
separate
internal
consistency
question
which
i'll
get
to
once
we've
disposed
of
the
discrimination
problem.
now,
i
think
that
first
of
all
the
court
has
addressed
this
issue
in
darnell.
now,
i
know
mr.
cummings
said
that
it
was
a
cryptic
decision.
we
don't
find
it
cryptic.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
everything
in
the
opinion
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
that
case,
although
the
kentucky
tax
was
a
different
tax
than
this
tax.
the
kentucky
tax
was
a
property
tax
which
actually
differed
even
from
the
property
tax
in
darnell,
in
that
as
i
understand
the
kentucky
system,
if
a
corporation
paid
tax
on
75
percent
of
its
property
to
kentucky,
then
there
would
be
an
automatic
complete
deduction
in
taxability
of
the
shares,
which
is
not
the
system
we
have
here.
but
insofar
as
the
kentucky
court
was
saying
that
the
kind
of
system
we
have
here
is
discriminatory
and
is
not
saved
by
the
compensatory
tax
doctrine,
which
we
disagree
with
that
analysis,
as
i
say,
first
of
all
we
think
that
the
court
addressed
precisely
this
problem
in
darnell,
which
we
don't
find
cryptic,
and
i
think
looking
at
what
justice
holmes
said
for
a
unanimous
court,
and
looking
at
the
arguments
that
were
made
to
the
court
in
darnell,
the
argument
was
precisely
the
argument
that's
being
made
here,
that
there
was
a
discrimination
in
the
treatment
of
the
corporate
shares.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
as
i
understand
it,
and
perhaps
i'm
missing
the
crypticism
there,
but
as
i
understand
it,
what
was
happening
in
darnell
was
that
there
was
a
tax
on
real
and
tangible
property
that
was
imposed
on
corporations,
and
there
was
an
intangibles
tax
imposed
on
the
value
of
all
corporate
shares
in
the
state,
and
insofar
as
the
state
paid
intangible...
insofar
as
the
corporation
paid
tax
on
its
tangible
and
personal
property
in
the
state,
then
the
taxpayer
was
relieved,
the
individual
shareholder
was
relieved
of
paying
a
shares
tax,
just
as
there
is
relief
here
for
the
individual
shareholder
if
the
corporation
pays
income
tax.
and
the
court,
looking
at
this
scheme,
said
that
a
tax
on
the
property
of
a
domestic
corporation...
and
this
was
the
court's
language...
a
tax
on
the
property
of
a
domestic
corporation
and
on
the
shares
of
a
foreign
one
is
consistent
with
substantial
equality,
and
that's
precisely
what
we're
saying
here,
that
there
are
related
values
that
are
being
taxed
in
precise
proportion
to
one
another.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
the
best
i
can
do...
perhaps
i
can't
satisfy
you
completely,
your
honor,
but
the
best
i
can
do
is
that
the
share
is
a
representation
of
something
else.
it's
a
representation
of
other
values.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
and
our
analysis
is
that
taxing
both
the
representation
of
the
income
stream
and
taxing
the
income
stream
is
in
a
sense
a
kind
of
duplicative
taxation,
and...
because
one
is
a
representation
of
the
value,
the
other
is
the
value
itself.
i
mean,
that
is
the
rationale
for
what
the
state
is
doing
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
in
a
sense...
i
mean,
when
you
look
at
the
shares
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that's
right.
that's
why
this--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
this
case
is
a
stronger
case
for
the
state
than
darnell,
because
as
you
say,
clearly
investors
understand
shares
as
representing
a
portion
of
income.
i
mean,
that's
why
price-to-earnings
ratio
is
such
an
important
instrument
for
investors,
so
i
think
that...
darnell
makes
our
case
a
fortiori
if
darnell
was
a
representation
of
equivalent
value.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
have
been
very
few
decisions
of
this
court
involving
compensating
taxes
at
all.
i
mean,
there
was
a
recent
decision,
the
oregon
waste
decision,
which
rejected
a
compensated
tax
argument.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
was
a
decision,
the
arctic
maid
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
which
accepted
a
compensating
tax
argument
involving
one
tax
which
was
imposed
upon
the
canning
of
fish
and
another
tax
that
was
imposed
upon
the
freezing
of
fish.
now,
that
is
not
a
perfect
analogy
to
our
case
because
both
taxes
were--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
plead
that
darnell--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--is
a
compensating
tax
which
is
directly
on
point,
and
i
think
it's
useful,
your
honor,
to
contrast
this
case
with
the
oregon
waste
systems
decision
from
2
years
ago,
which
i
think
is
very
instructive
on
how
to
analyze
this.
the
oregon
waste
systems
case,
oregon
argued
that
its
discriminatory
tax
on
disposal
of
waste
at
oregon
landfills
and
its
income
tax
were
substantially
related
and
that
the
taxes
were
compensatory,
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument
because
it
found
that
disposal
of
waste
at
an
oregon
landfill
and
earning
income
are
not
substantially
related,
and
to
prove
that
point,
the
court
found
it
decisive
that
an
oregon
firm
that
disposed
of
waste
in
an
oregon
landfill
would
be
subject
both
to
the
income
tax
and
to
the
discriminatory
landfill
fee,
meaning
that
the
case...
that
the
taxes
were
not
mutually
exclusive
proxies
for
each
other.
now,
i
mean,
here,
i
think
that
the
test--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that...
that
should
not
be
misleading
here,
your
honor.
neither
of
these
taxes
is
a
tax
on
access
to
capital
markets
as
such.
the
income
tax
is
a
tax
on
the
earning
of
income
in
the
state,
and
it's
justified
by
the
benefits
that
the
state
provides
to
corporations
that
earn
income
there,
and
the
shares
tax
is
a
tax
on
the
ownership
of
property,
intangible
property
in
north
carolina,
and
the
taxpayer
here
is
a
north
carolina
resident--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
make
that
point,
your
honor,
simply
because,
in
response
to
the
taxpayer's
argument
here
that
the
effect
of
this
tax
is
to
burden
out-of-state
corporations
in
their
issuing
of
shares,
and
that
somehow
that's
unfair
because
those
corporations
get
no
benefit
from
north
carolina.
in
fact,
we
think
they
derive
substantial
benefits
from
services
provided
by
north
carolina
which
allow
those
firms
to
sell
to
residents
who
have
accumulated
capital
and
to
engage
in
transactions
with
these
out-of-state
firms,
so
we
don't
justify
these
taxes
because
each
tax
is
imposed
in
precisely
the
same
way
on
access
to
capital
markets.
we
justify
these
taxes
because,
and
perhaps
my
exchange
with
justice
breyer
was
unsatisfactory,
but
we
justify
these
taxes
because
we
view,
as
we
think
the
court
did
in
darnell,
corporate
shares
as
being
representation
of
other
values,
and
those
values
may
be
equivalent.
they
may
be
substantially
similar
within
the
meaning
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
don't
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
only
really
relevant
recent
compensatory
taxation
law
is
the
oregon
waste
systems
case,
and
as
i
say,
the
decisive
fact,
the
court
identified
as
the
decisive
fact
in
that
case
that
the
two
taxes
were
not
imposed
as
mutually
exclusive
proxies
for
one
another.
here,
the
taxes
are
mutually
exclusive
proxies
by
definition.
they're
linked
in
the
text
of
the
tax
statutes.
if
a
corporation
pays
income
tax,
then
its
shares
are
exempt
from
tax,
from
the
shares
tax.
if
a
corporation
does
not
pay
income
tax,
its
shares
are
subjected
to
the
shares
tax,
so
they
are
by
definition
mutually
exclusive
proxies.
that,
i
think,
is
the
first
and
most
important
evidence
that
the
taxes
are--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
as
your
initial
question
to
my
colleague
suggested,
i
think
the
court
has
never
actually
squarely
resolved
that,
and
it
is
arguable
that,
given
the
nature
of
intangible
property,
this
is
something
we
can
get
to
in
the
apportionment
part
of
our
argument.
it
is
conceivable
that
duplicative
taxation,
those
intangibles
would
be
permissible,
and
that
principle
might
also
suggest
that
discriminatory
taxation--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
have
not
made
that
argument.
we
have
argued
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
court's
cases,
that
there
is
a
compensatory
tax
that
overcomes
that
discrimination.
i
think
one
should
look
to
the
three
parts
of
the
compensatory
tax
test
that
the
court
has
identified.
it
has
asked
that
the
taxpayer...
that
the
state
identify
the
intrastate
tax
burden
for
which
it
is
trying
to
compensate.
here,
that
is
clearly
the
income
tax.
it
has
asked
that
the
taxes
be
shown
to
be
a
roughly
equivalent
amount.
here,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
demonstrated
that
in
its
opinion,
pages
12
to
14,
the
petition...
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
ran
through
an
analysis
showing
that
the
actual
dollar
amounts
imposed--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
probably
not,
your
honor,
although
the
court
has
never
squarely
resolved
in
a
holding
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--right,
but
let
me
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
it
is
an
open
question,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--virtually
all
states
do,
but
i
think
this
is
an
important
point--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
court
in
jefferson
lines
very
strongly
suggested
that
such
a
credit
would
be
necessary,
but
i
think
that
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--oh,
i--
[laughter]
fortunately
i
am
not
a
betting
man,
your
honor,
so
i
guess
that
gives
me
the
right
not
to
express
an
opinion
on
how
that
would
be...
on
the
outcome.
but
assuming
that
such
a
credit
would
be
necessary
in
the
sales
and
use
tax
situation,
and
i
will
assume
that
for
purposes
of
answering
your
question--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
the
outcome
would
be
different
here.
even
if
a
credit
is
necessary
there,
we
think
that
because
this
is
a
tax
on
intangible
property,
there's
a
different
outcome
here.
the
reason
that
the
credit
is
required,
if
it
is
required
in
that
situation,
is
the
apportionment
requirement,
not
the
nondiscrimination
requirement
of
the
commerce
clause.
it's
an
internal
consistency
problem,
and
apportionment
and
internal
consistency
go
to
the
question
of
whether
the
state
is
taking
more
than
its
fair
share
of
the
value
from
any
one
transaction,
more
than
its
fair
share
of
any
tax
value,
and
the
court
has
said
in
jefferson
lines
that
a
failure
of
internal
consistency
is...
as
a
general
matter
shows
that
one
state
is
taking
more
than
its
fair
share.
that's
the
problem
generally
with
duplicative
taxation,
that
two
states
are
taxing
the
same
thing,
each
taking
100
percent
of
the
value,
which
might
be
the
situation
you
hypothesized,
the
sales
and
use
tax.
then
we
assume
that
one
state
is
taking...
or
perhaps
both
states
are
taking
more
than
their
fair
share.
but
the
court
has
said
that
principle
does
not
apply
to
the
taxation
of
intangible
property,
and
while
with
income
one
can
see
where
the
inputs
that
go
to
the
creation
of
income
are
located
and
apportion
taxing
authority
over
that
income
accordingly,
one
can
see
where
tangible
property
is
located
and
can
assign
taxing
authority
to
the
states
of
that
location,
the
court
has
said,
and
i'm
here
quoting
from
the
court's
opinion
in
curry
v.
mccanless
which
was
written
by
justice
stone,
and
it's
very
closely
associated
with
that
element
of
the
court's
modern
due
process
doctrine...
or
modern
commerce
clause
doctrine.
the
court
has
said
that
very
different
consideration
is
both
theoretical
and
practical
applied
in
the
taxation
of
intangible
property,
and
that
is
because
it
is
impossible
to
identify
a
single
location
for
something
that
has
no
physical
characteristics
and
that
is
intimately
associated
with
the
laws
in
more
than
one
state,
and
the
court--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
would
strive
to
make
my
arguments
not
internally
inconsistent
themselves,
your
honor.
it
is
certainly
our
position
that
the
values
reached
by
the
income
tax
and
the
shares
tax
are
substantially
related
within
the
meaning
of
compensatory
tax
doctrine
in
the
oregon
waste
systems
decision,
but
we
do
not
say
that
the
shares
tax
is,
in
fact,
a
tax
on
income.
it's
a
tax
on
the
ownership
of
intangible
property,
and
as
the
court
has
said,
even
though
substantially
related
values
are
reached
by
two
taxes,
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax,
and
indeed
the
apportionability
of
the
tax,
may
turn
on
the
form
in
which
the
tax
is
pleased,
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax,
the
nature
of
the
tax--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
i
mean,
the
sale
and
use
tax
situation,
one
tax
is
imposed
upon--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
many
states
like
north
carolina
impose
the
legal
incidence
of
their
sales
tax
on
the
seller,
whereas
the
legal
incidence
of
the
use
tax
is
invariably
on
the
buyer,
so
in
that
situation
you
have
different
categories
of
taxpayers,
and
the
very
first
of
the
court's
compensatory
tax
cases,
hinson
v.
lott,
involved
a
tax
on...
one
tax
on
distillers,
another
tax
on
distributors
and
dealers
in
liquor,
so
there
are
different
categories
who
can
be
subject
to
the
tax.
i
think...
i
mean,
the
way
that
the
court
has
described
the
compensatory
tax
doctrine
has
not
required
precise
equivalents
on
every
aspect
of
the
tax,
has
not
required
that
the
taxes
be
graphed
and
all
the
peaks
and
valleys
match
exactly,
as
long
as
the
ultimate
burden
on
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce
match
up.
and
indeed,
the
way
the
court
has
described
the
compensatory
tax
doctrine
in
the
oregon
wastes
systems
case
is
that
the
taxes
must
be
substantially
similar,
not
that
they
must
be
identical,
which
mirrors
the
language
very
closely
in
the
darnell
case
upon
which
we
rely
that
their
taxes
must
be
consistent
with
substantial
equality,
so
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to
find
precision
to
satisfy
the
compensatory
tax--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
guess
that
depends
in
part
upon
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--darnell.
alaska
maid
was
not
a
question--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
it
was,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
as
i
say,
the
court
in
hinson
v.
lott,
the
case
that
this
court
cited
in
oregon
waste
systems
decision
as
the
genesis
of
the
compensatory
tax
doctrine,
long
preceded
darnell,
and
the
language
the
court
used
in
darnell
is
similar,
substantially
similar
to
the
language
that
it
uses
in
the
oregon
waste
systems
case,
so
there's
no
reason
to
think
the
court
was
applying
different
standards.
in
any
event,
in
oregon
waste
systems,
the
court's
most
recent
decision,
it
referred...
has
used
the
language
of
substantial
similarity,
and
not
precision.
i
think
the
point
of
the
doctrine
is
not
a
formalism
that's
designed
to
match
up
the
taxes,
as
i
say,
at
every
point.
the
idea
of
the
doctrine
is
to
be
sure
that
interstate
commerce
is
not
being
disadvantaged,
ultimately,
in
contrast
to
intrastate
commerce,
and
i
think
we
can
demonstrate
to
you
that
as
a
matter
of
economic
reality,
that
that
is
not
happening.
but
to
return
to
the
question
of
apportionment,
and
in
terms
of
consistency,
which
i
think
is
a
crucial
question
here,
and
whether
or
not
this
should
be
treated
as
an
intangible
property
tax
and
an
income
tax,
the
fact
is,
this
is
an
intangible
property
tax.
as
in
jefferson
lines,
the
fact
that
the
tax
is
put
in
that
form
may
determine
whether
or
not
it's
apportionable,
and
if...
look
at
it
this
way.
the
taxpayer's
complaint
here,
ultimately,
on
the
apportionment
part
of
the
argument,
is
that
its
values
are
being
subjected,
or
could
be
subjected
to
duplicative
taxation
in
other
states.
if
we're
right
about
the
treatment
of
intangible
property,
and
we
think
that
the
court's
holding
on
that
are
absolutely
clear,
then
if
this
precise
tax,
this
precise
shares
tax
on
100
percent
of
the
value,
were
replicated
in
some
other
state,
he
would
have
no
complaint.
the
taxpayer
would
have
no
complaint
because
of
that
duplicative
taxation.
so
if
other
states
had
shares
taxes
at
100
percent
of
value,
there
would
be
no
complaint
by
the
taxpayer
here.
the
fact
that
the
state
had
income
taxes
and
that
is
a
duplicative
taxation
because
of
the
substantial
similar
value
shouldn't
give
him
more
of
a
complaint
than
he
has
now,
and
i
think
jefferson
lines
is
very
good
authority
on
that
point,
that
one
looks
to
the
nature
of
the
taxes
being
challenged.
even
though
the
economic
effect
of
the
tax,
economic
reality
of
the
tax
may
be
similar
to
a
tax
that
has
to
be
apportioned,
the
fact
that
the
tax
is
put
in
forms
that
does
not
require
apportionment
should
be
dispositive.
so
i
think
ultimately
for
the
court
to
rule
for
the
taxpayer
in
this
case,
it
clearly
would
have
to
overrule
darnell
v.
indiana,
which
we
think
is
clearly
on
point,
it
would
have
to
set
aside
the
precedents
holding
that
duplicative
taxation
of
intangible
property
is
permissible.
it
would
also,
we
think,
have
to
cut
back
on
the
principle
and
say
intrastate
commerce
can
be
made
to
pay
its
own
way
and
need
not
be
placed
in
a
favored
position,
because
if
the
taxpayer's
position
here
prevails,
the
state
will
have
to
either
impose
duplicative
taxation
of
intrastate
commerce,
which
is
clearly,
as
an
historical
matter,
what
it
was
trying
to
avoid,
or
it
will
have
to
abandon
any
taxation
of
intangibles
altogether,
which
means
it
will
have
to
give
up
the
chance
to
tax
values
that
clearly
are
present
in
the
state
and
that
it
has
a
right
to
tax.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
court
to
take
such
a
substantial
step
in
the
decision,
and
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
therefore
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--thank
you
very
much.
