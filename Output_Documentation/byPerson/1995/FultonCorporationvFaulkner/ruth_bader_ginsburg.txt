is
it
your
position
that
there
is
no
tax
that
a
state
can
constitutionally
impose
on
the
in-state
shareholders
of
an
out-of-state
operating
corporation?
there
is
no
constitutionally
permissible
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
tax
could
a
state
impose
on
the
shares
that
its
taxpayers
hold
in
corporations
acting
out
of
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
stock,
so
if
they
didn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
nothing
singularly.
is
there
any
tax
that
could
be
imposed
on
north
carolina
shareholders
of
out-of-state
corporations
that
are
operating
out
of
state,
period?
are
you
saying
that
any
tax...
of
course,
if
you
tax
domestic
corporations
you
can
put
it
on
evenly,
but
just
with
respect
to
the
out-of-state--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rothfeld,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
recently
dealt
with
this
matter,
and
as
i
understand
its
decision,
it
rejected
your
argument
up
until
the
last
step.
it
found
that
there
was
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
it
went
all
the
way
down
the
line
as
though
it
were
going
to
hold
for
the
taxpayer,
but
in
the
end
it
said,
but
darnell
is
the
supreme
court's
instruction,
and
so
despite
the
prior
steps
that
went
in
the
taxpayer's
favor,
at
the
bottom
line,
darnell
is
the
supreme
court's
instruction
and
so
we
follow
it.
but
as
i
understand
the
kentucky
supreme
court,
it
rejected
the
argument
that
you
have
been
making
so
far.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
do
find
it
cryptic,
so
maybe
you
can
explain
it
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
agree
that
there
could
be
a
retroactive
imposition
of
a
tax
on
people
who
had
no
notice
at
the
time
that
the
tax
liability
accrued?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
said
that
without
the
party
affected
before
the
court.
