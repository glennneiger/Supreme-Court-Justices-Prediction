justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here...
isn't
it
true
that
in
this
case,
although
it
wasn't
litigated,
it
was
raised
in
the
complaint,
wasn't
it,
in
the
earlier
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
quote...
the
allegation
is
that
the
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
it's
not
just
alluded
to,
it
was
alleged
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
not
passed
on
by
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
is
clear
that
it
could
have
been
raised
in
that
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
it
was
before
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
had...
what
if
they
had
actually
litigated
it?
would
you
then
take
the
same
position?
say
they'd
offered
evidence
on
the...
and
the
trial
judge
had
said,
no,
i
don't
think
there's
any
merit
to
it,
and
then
the
plaintiffs
had
said,
well,
we
don't
think
this
is
our
strongest
point,
as
a
matter
of
tactics
we
won't
appeal
the
trial
court's
ruling,
we'll
just
accept
the
trial
court's
ruling--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
on
that--
--but
the
key
to
your
case
is
not
privity,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
lurked
in
the
complaint...
it
didn't
lurk,
it
was
there
in
plain
english.
mr.
baxley,
is...
you
said
that
privity
is
not
the
key
to
your
case.
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
keys
to
it.
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
prongs
of
your
argument,
and
if
you
won
on
that
you
would,
on
your
view,
be
entitled
to
win
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i...
but
the...
justice
o'connor
raised
it
earlier.
aren't
there
a
lot
of
statutes
out
there
and
a
lot
of
procedures
in
state
courts
where
they
allow
one
challenge
only
to
some
kind
of
a
public
expenditure
of
funds,
or
a
new
taxing
statute?
they
just
simply
don't
allow
a
second.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
all
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
if
it
would
be...
they
didn't
rule...
dismiss
the
case
as
a
whole
because
it
was
premature,
did
they?
didn't
they
rule
on
the
merits
of
what
the...
the
issues
that
were
raised?
i
don't
know
why
the
exemption
issue
would
be
any
more
premature
than
any
other
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they...
that's
true
of
the
whole
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
court
nevertheless
went
ahead
and
adjudicated
the
merits
of
the
issues
that
it
thought
important.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
your
prematurity
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
in
the
governmental
context,
normally
the
government
feels
comfortable
proceeding
with
all
the
risks,
reliance
on
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis?
once
they've
got
a...
the
supreme
court
of
a
state
has
ruled
on
and
passed
on
most
of
the
issues,
they
figure
things
are
okay.
and
something...
somebody
can
always
come
up
with
some
new
idea,
but
to
say
they
have
to
have
claim
preclusion
to
give
the
government
authority
sufficient
confidence
to
go
ahead
with
their
project
seems
to
me
carrying
it
a
little
farther
than
you
really
have
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
on
the
distinction
of
stare
decisis
and
preclusion?
can
you
cite
me
any
case
in
which
a
plaintiff
was
found
to
be
barred
by
res
judicata,
estoppel,
whatever
it
might
be,
not
stare
decisis,
but
a
judgment
in
a
case
in
which
he
was
neither
a
party
nor
a
privity
to
a
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
saying
no...
not
class
action,
because
bedingfield
was
not
a
class
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
give
me
a
case
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
was
a
fifth
circuit
case,
wasn't
it?
