justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not...
certainly
not
true.
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
you
have
a...
i
mean,
we
have
cases
where
the
constitution
contains
a
statement
of
accounts
clause,
and
we
have
held
that
a
private
citizen
cannot
sue,
has
no
standing
to
sue
to
compel
the
expenditures
of
the
cia
to
be
disclosed
under
that
provision.
we
say,
maybe
it
violates
the
constitution,
maybe
it
doesn't,
but
no
individual
has
standing
because
it's
a
generalized
interest.
now,
we
have
that
doctrine
at
the
federal
level
because
of
separation
of
powers
concerns,
because
we
have
a
distinctive
federal
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
the
states
don't
have
to
follow
our
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
and
if
they
choose
to
allow
a
suit
in
that
situation,
why
is
it
a
denial
of
due
process
for
them
to
say,
we're
going
to
allow
the
suit,
but
only
one,
whereas
we
don't
allow
the
suit
at
all?
how
can
they
be
in
worse
shape
constitutionally
than
we
are?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
very
carefully
and
quite
appropriately
pick
a
case
in
which
there
would
have
been
standing
in
federal
courts.
all
that
has
been
suggested
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
justice
ginsburg,
and
i'm
suggesting
the
same
thing,
is
that
you're
casting
your
net
too
widely,
that
there
are
certain...
you
have...
there
are
certainly
some
actions
in
which
the
state
allows
a
citizen
to
proceed
with
a
suit
where
we
don't.
the
construction
of
a
bridge.
if
someone
says
that
the
construction
of
a
bridge
is
contrary
to
law...
the
person
is
not
harmed
at
all.
he
just
says,
i
don't
like
federal
money
being
spent
for
something
it
shouldn't
be
spent
for.
could
he
bring
suit
in
federal
court?
no.
he
can
bring
suit
in
many
states
simply
on
the
ground
that
this
money
shouldn't
be
expended
by
the
county,
or
whoever
it
is.
now,
your
position
is
that
although
it's
perfectly
okay
to
deny
the
suit
to
anybody,
the
state
cannot
say,
well,
we'll
allow
the
suit,
but
only
once,
that
the
latter
violates
due
process
of
law,
but
the
former
does
not.
that
is
not
a
very
appealing
proposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
in
order
to
agree
with
you,
we
don't
have
to
go
as
far
as
you
initially
urged
us,
to
say
that
in
every
case
where
a
state
allows
suit
it
has
to
allow
that
a
later
plaintiff
can
bring
the
same
suit.
let
me
put
the
question
more
specifically.
do
you
believe
that
your
client
would
have
had
standing
under
federal
law
to
challenge
what
was
done
here
if
it
had
been
done
by
the
federal
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
let's
assume
this
scheme
is
in
effect
and
it's
a
federal
scheme
rather
than
a
state
or
county
scheme.
it's
a
federal
scheme.
would
there
have
been
standing
under
our
federal
law
of
standing
to
sue?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
only
point
you
need
sustain,
that
in
the
type
of
a
lawsuit
where
there
would
be
standing
under
the
federal
law
of
standing,
in
that
type
of
lawsuit,
at
least,
you
cannot
preclude
a
plaintiff
who
was
not
actually
bound
by
the
first
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
agree
with
that
more
limited
proposition
and
perhaps
find
for
you
on
that
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
why
isn't
that...
why
isn't
that
not
a
(b)(1)
or
(b)(2)
kind
of
suit,
but,
rather,
a
(b)(3)
suit?
i
mean,
you're
almost
quoting
(b)(3),
the
court
finds
the
question
of
law
or
fact
common
to
the
members
of
the
class
predominate
over
any
questions
affecting
only
individual
members.
i
mean,
you're
talking--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
the
court
satisfies
itself
that
counsel
is
an
adequate
counsel,
other
people
who
don't
want
to
be
represented
by
this
counsel
must
be
held
to
whatever
he
achieves,
is
that
the
principle
you're
urging
for?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
if
i
had
a
cause
of
action,
even
if
it
involves
a
legal
issue
that's
common
to
causes
of
action
that
other
people
have,
i'm
entitled
to
hire
my
own
counsel
and
go
litigate
that
myself.
you
say
that
we
can
dispense
with
that,
and
we
can
say,
so
long
as
we
satisfy
ourselves
we
have
a
good
lawyer
in
front
of
us,
and
that
this
lawyer
is
going
to
do
as
good
a
job
as
any
other,
we
can
tell
the
other
people
go
away,
you
must
be
represented
by
this
person.
the
state
can
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
kind
of
case
is
that?
what
is
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
--about
this
kind
of
case
from
the
cases
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--justice
breyer
was
asking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
historic--
--can
you
think
of
anything
more
governmental
than
the
criminal
law?
is
it
really
your
position
that
when
one
individual
challenges
the
constitutionality
of
a
particular
criminal
law
provision
and
loses,
and
maybe
even
chooses
not
to
appeal,
that
everybody
else
is
bound
by
the
decision
that
that
criminal
law
provision
is
constitutional?
you
say,
well,
you
had
a
fair
run
at
it.
this
person
represented
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
any
different?
i
don't
understand
that.
