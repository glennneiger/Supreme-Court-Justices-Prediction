justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
baxley,
there...
your
opponents
cite
a
string
of
cases,
many
of
them
state
cases,
in
which
some
kind
of
claim
preclusion
doctrine,
or
res
judicata,
if
you
will,
has
been
applied
despite
a
change
in
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff
taxpayer
in
suits
by
citizens
challenging
tax
laws
in
state
court.
now,
there
is
that
body
of
authority,
and
how
do
you
deal
with
that,
and
what's
the
extent
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
doctrine
of
claim
preclusion
in
these
citizen
taxpayer
suits
in
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
remember,
that
was
a
dissent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
didn't
carry
the
day.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
court
in
the
bedingfield
case
here
had
actually
decided
the
issue
that
you're
raising
now,
would
you
be
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
your
answer?
would
you
then
be
precluded,
a
new
taxpayer,
from
bringing
the
same
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wait,
do
you
say
that
a
state
can't
even
authorize
a
class
action
and
have
the
result
of
that
class
action
binding
on
members
of
the
class?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
(b)(1)
of
what?
what
are
you
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
bedingfield
was
not
a
class
action,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
was
brought
by--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
was
two
actions
brought
by
individuals
in
the
city
of
birmingham.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
bedingfield
was
not...
let's
clarify
this,
if
we
may.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
brought--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--expressly
as
a
class
action--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
allowed
as
such?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
why
isn't...
why
isn't
this
a
property
right
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
isn't
there
a
property
right
here
being
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
present
action,
a
right
of
action
created
by
section
1983
authorizing
individuals
to
sue
for
violation
of
their
individual,
equal
protection
rights?
now,
why
isn't
it
that
kind
of
claim
being
made
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
order
for
a
prior
suit
to
somehow
take
away
that
property
right
and
that
cause
of
action,
wouldn't
we
think
due
process
would
require
some
kind
of
notice,
and
wouldn't
we
also
think
it
would
require
some
kind
of
adequate
representation
of
these
plaintiffs
in
the
prior
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
there
been
any
determination
of
adequate
representation
in
bedingfield
of
these
plaintiffs
and
their
suit?
