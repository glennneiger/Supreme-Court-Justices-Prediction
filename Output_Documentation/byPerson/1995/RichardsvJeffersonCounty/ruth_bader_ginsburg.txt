justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
baxley,
just
to
be
clear
on
what's
at
issue,
if,
in
fact,
the
matter
had
been
decided
in
the
prior
suit,
raised,
litigated,
and
decided,
then
really
it
wouldn't
be
too
significant
whether
you
put
a
preclusion,
it
wouldn't
be
a
plain
preclusion,
an
issue
preclusion
label
on
it,
because
you'd
have
precedent
from
the
highest
court
in
your
state.
you'd
be
bound
by
stare
decisis,
so
it
wouldn't...
if
they
actually
decided
the
question,
if
the
alabama
supreme
court
actually
decided
the
question
in
the
bedingfield
case,
then
wouldn't
you
realistically
be
out
of
court
in
your
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
about
stare
decisis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
case
really
depends
on
this
issue
not
having
been
fully
litigated
and
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
baxley,
but
in
many
of
these
instances,
these
so
called
taxpayer
suits,
you
wouldn't
even
have
any
right
at
all
to
be
in
court
were
it
not
for
the
grace
of
the
state
that
allows
you
to
be
kind
of
a
private
attorney
general.
i
would
think...
your
taxpayer
is
someone
who
is
paying
tax
and
doesn't
want
to.
these
taxpayer
suits,
where
the
taxpayer
emerges
to
represent
the
public,
are
quite
a
different
animal,
are
they
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
due
process
right
to
bring
a
case
that,
if
you
were
in
the
federal
court,
they'd
probably
say
you
don't
even
have
standing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
have
no
right
to
begin
with
under
the
federal
constitution...
you
have
a
taxpayer,
an
actual
taxpayer
who
doesn't
want
to
pay
tax
out
of
his
pocket.
isn't
that
quite
a
different
case
from
what
is
labeled,
taxpayer
suit,
and
what
that
note
in
the
brief
is
of...
the
other
side
is
filled
with
what
we
call
taxpayer
suits,
where
someone
emerges
as
champion
of
the
public
in
general,
but
is
no
more
affected
than
the
public
in
general.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
are
talking
about
real
taxpayers,
and
that's
a
little
different,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
absence
of
privity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
just
finished
discussing
that
whole
taxpayer
suit
category,
and
now
we're
into
taxpayer
who
says,
i
got
this
tax
bill
and
i've
paid
it
and
i
want
a
refund,
or
the
situation
that
you're
in.
there's
an
occupational
tax,
and
your
client
says,
it's
not
fair
to
make
me
pay
that
tax,
so...
but
why
isn't
it
fair
for
the
state
to
say,
it's
good
enough
to
have
in
this
category,
too,
one
taxpayer
with
a
good
lawyer
fight
out
the
case
so
we're
going
to
apply
in
this
taxpayer
as
taxpayer
area
the
same
thing
we
apply
in
the
municipal
bondholder's
suit,
and
the
people
who
want
to
challenge
the
annexation
of
a
county,
or
mrs.
frothingham
who
wants
to
challenge
how
public
money
is
spent.
we're
going
to
apply
the
same
doctrine
to
all
of
them.
you
get
a
good
lawyer
in
suit
number
1
and
fight
it
out,
and
that's
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
is
not...
we've
just
been
all
around
that.
let's
concentrate
on
the
case
of
a
taxpayer,
a
true
taxpayer.
this
is
not
somebody
who's
coming
forward
as
a
private
attorney
general.
this
is
someone
that
the
state
of
alabama
is
saying,
you
owe
an
occupational
tax.
all
right,
that's
standing
in
the
federal
court,
and
it's
certainly
standing
in
the
federal
court,
so
let's
forget
about
the
taxpayer
suits
of
the
kind
where
you
wouldn't
have
standing
in
federal
court,
where
you're
just
one
of
everybody
in
the
public,
and
nobody
is
hitting
you
in
your
own
pocket.
let's
concentrate
on
those.
now,
i
do
not
know
of
legions
of
precedent
that
say,
you
can
have
a
virtual
class
action
without
notice
to
anybody
in
the
class.
that's
what
we're
dealing
with,
and
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
address.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
usually
an
injunction
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
give
me
an
example
of
a
money
relief
case,
a
case
involving
money,
where
people
can
be
cut
out
without
any
notice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
slaughter,
how
does
your
argument
stand
against
an
important
precedent
in
this
court,
a
case
called
mullane
v.
hanover
bank,
where
the
court
explained
if
someone's
interest
is
being
affected
there
has
to
be
an
effort
to
tell
that
person,
not
the
best
service
that
money
could
buy,
but
some
notice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
weren't
they
represented
by
the
people
who
were
there?
there
were
some
of
the
beneficiaries
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
slaughter,
that's
not
quite
right,
is
it?
there
isn't
mandatory
notice
because
there
is
such
a
variety
of
cases
that
come
under
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2),
but
look
at
(d)(3),
which
instructs
the
court
to
require
for
the
protection
of
the
members
of
the
class
or
otherwise
for
the
fair
conduct
of
the
action
that
notice
be
given
in
such
manner
as
the
court
may
direct.
i
assume
from
that
provision
that
in
a
case
comparable
to
the
mullane
situation
a
district
court,
if
we
were
operating
under
the
federal
rules
and
in
alabama,
since
they
have
virtually
the
same
rules,
would
say
in
this
kind
of
action
you
have
to
give
notice.
you
don't
have
to
hire
a
process
server,
but
you
have
to
put
a
summons
and
complaint
in
the
mail,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
slaughter,
why
do
we
bother
having
class
actions
at
all?
i
mean,
it's
so
much
easier
just
to
say,
champion,
come
forward,
get
yourself
a
good
lawyer,
forget
notice,
it's
much
more
efficient.
if
you
are
right,
then
there's
no
need
for
a
class
action.
why
would
anybody
want
to
bother
to
go
through
all
that
business
of
getting
it
certified,
if
all
you
have
to
do
is
get
somebody
who
is
similarly
situated,
that
person
gets
a
decent
lawyer,
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
the
case
is
decided
once
and
for
all
for
everybody.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are...
are
you
saying
that
there
are...
sometimes
you
do
need
a
class
action
with
the
court
to
certify
the
class
and
notice
to
the
members.
can
you
distinguish
for
me
the
cases
where
you
do
need
a
class
action,
if
that
is
your
position,
and
those
where
you
don't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
slaughter--
--but
don't
you--
--i'm
a
little
confused.
you
just
said
you
were
not
insisting
on
claim
preclusion.
instead,
you
said
issue
preclusion,
but
issue
preclusion,
or
what
some
people
call
collateral
estoppel,
requires
not
merely
the
issue
be
raised,
but
that
it
be
actually
litigated,
and
decided,
and
essential
to
the
decision,
and
it's
those
two
things,
actually
litigated
and
decided
and
is
central
to
the
decision,
that
you
don't
have
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
slaughter,
you
mentioned
that
you
case
is
a
little
shaky
on
the
claim
preclusion
part,
but
you
say
it's
solid
on
issue
preclusion,
and
since
you
do
have
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
your
state,
is
there,
in
fact,
any
difference
between
stare
decisis
and
issue
preclusion
with
respect
to
these
issues,
the
ones
that
were
actually
litigated
and
decided
all
the
way
up
the
line
in
alabama?
is
there
any
significant
difference
between
those
two
labels?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can
always
bring
a
suit,
and
in
both
cases
it
seems
to
me
the
other
side
would
move
for
summary
judgment
and
one
case
would
say,
issue
preclusion,
and
the
other
case
would
say,
stare
decisis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
little
more
wriggle
room.
