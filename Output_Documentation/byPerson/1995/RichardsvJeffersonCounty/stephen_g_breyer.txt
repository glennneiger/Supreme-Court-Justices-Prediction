justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
if...
assuming
that...
i
mean,
you
may...
i
think
you
may
be
right
that
(b)(2)
is
implicated
here,
but
i
thought
there's
a
mistake
the
state
court
seemed
to
have
made.
they
thought
that
this
taxpayer
action
was
like
the
private
attorney
general
taxpayer
action,
which
is
where
these
cases
originated,
but
that
isn't
this.
this
is
a
case,
isn't
it,
like
a
bunch
of
10,000
people
living
in
a
city,
and
the
city
puts
up
some
noxious
fumes,
and
all
10,000
people
breathe
them,
so
they
want
to
proceed
against
a
nuisance,
or
there's
a
giant
accident,
and
it
happens
to
kill
or
hurt
10,000
people,
and
there
you
would
have,
let's
say,
a
(b)(2)
action
for
nuisance.
but
very
well,
i
didn't
find
any
contrary
authority
to
the
proposition
that
if
you
have
a
class
action
of
that
kind,
you
have
to
give
notice
to
the
other
people.
at
least
you
should
give
notice.
if
joe
smith
is
going
to
be
the
first
person
to
run
in
and
sue
the
city
for
the
nuisance,
or
the
first
person
to
collect,
jones
and
14,000
other
people
should
at
least
have
notice
of
what's
going
on
and
a
chance
to
talk
to
the
judge
before
they
can
be
bound
in
res
judicata.
at
least,
i
don't
know
why
that
shouldn't
be
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
it
does
not
say
that
in
the
rule.
that's
the
basis
of
my
question.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
i
couldn't
find
any
authority
that
explained
to
me
why
there
is
not
notice
in
(b)(2),
why
there
shouldn't
be
notice,
how
those
class
actions
work,
or
what
conceivable
thing
was
going
through
the
rulemaker's
mind
in
not
saying
you
should
have
notice,
given
the
precedent
in
the
supreme
court
that
you
can't
take
a
person's
action
away
from
them
without
notice.
that's
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they
bind?
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why,
because
normally
you'd
think,
in
a
situation
where
you're
proceeding
against
an
injunction,
for
example,
for
a
nuisance,
you
would
have
thought
the
first
person
to
sue
is
going
to
win
or
lose,
and
then
stare
decisis
will
take
care
of
the
rest.
but
i
was
rather
surprised
that
in
such
suits
that
first
person's
suit
could
bind
other
people
who
suffered
from
the
nuisance
on
issues
that
were
not
litigated.
now,
if,
in
fact,
that
did
happen
under
(b)(2)
or
this
historic
practice
in
equity,
i'd
like
to
know
why
it
happened,
because
it
happening
without
notice
would
seem,
(a)
very
unfair,
and
(b)
contrary
to
the
precedents
of
the
court
that
say
you
can't
take
a
person's
action
away
from
him
without
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
not
relate
to
(b)(2),
you're
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i'm
asking
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
on
that,
could
you
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
and
justice
o'connor's
question
for
just
a
second,
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
on...
there
are
two
equal
protection
claims,
i
think,
that
were
raised.
one
was
500,000,
and
they
might
have
litigated
that
one,
i
don't
know,
but
the
other
one
is
the
licensed
professionals
versus
the
other,
and
that
was
stated
in
the
claim
and
then
abandoned,
all
right,
i
guess,
or
they
never
got
to
it,
so
think
of
the
second
one,
all
right?
now,
i
take
it
no
notice...
is
there...
you
were
talking
about
tradition,
the
tradition
of
these
class
actions.
did
you
find
any
case...
because
i
couldn't
find
one,
but
did
you
find
a
case
which,
going
back
as
long
as
you
want
in
tradition,
would
say,
take,
e.g.,
a
nuisance
run
by
the
city
that
hurts
10,000
people,
not
a
taxpayer
action
that
is
a
private
attorney
general
action...
that's
out
of
this
case.
this
is
more
like
a
nuisance,
or
an
accident
that
hurts
10,000
people
in
their
cars.
did
you
find
any
case
where
the
first
person
to
bring
the
nuisance
suit
would
bind
later
people
who
did
not
have
notice
on
an
issue
that
wasn't
litigated?
that's
the
tradition
that
i
think
would
be
relevant
here,
and
i'm
not
saying
there
is
or
there
isn't.
i'm
saying
i
couldn't
find
such
a
thing,
and
i
do
see
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
falling
under
(b)(2),
and
maybe
the
appropriate
action
order
thing
that
justice
ginsburg
takes
care
of
it,
but
did
you
find
any
such
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that
were
so,
then
i
guess
it
wasn't
just
that
there
was
no
finding
that
the
representation
was
adequate.
what
concerns
me
more
than
that
is
the
fact
that
there
was
not
even
any
notice.
