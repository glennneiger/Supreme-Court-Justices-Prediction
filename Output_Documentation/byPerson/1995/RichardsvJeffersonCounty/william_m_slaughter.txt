mr.
william
m.
slaughter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
petitioners'
truncated
view
of
the
due
process
clause
with
respect
to
representational
suits,
that
they
would
overturn
several
hundred
years
of
equitable
development
of
class
actions
as
culminating
in
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
by
trying
to
rest
this
case
on
the
authority,
among
others,
of
martin
v.
wilks,
totally
ignoring
footnote
number
2,
in
which
the
chief
justice
reserved
from
the
implications
of
that
case
the
whole
panoply
of
representational
suits,
first
of
all
as
typified
by
hansberry
v.
lee,
and
also
the
second
cite
in
the
footnote
was
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--well,
i
think
he--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--that
may
be
his
argument,
but
it
is
both
historically
and
factually
incorrect.
the
laws
of
alabama
have
historically
allowed,
like
the
laws
of
other
states,
declaratory
actions
in
which
private
citizens
act
as
attorney
generals
to
challenge
public
law--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--well,
class
actions
under
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2),
which
he
is
trying
to
certify
in
the
petitioners'
case,
is
exactly
that
kind
of
case.
(b)(1)
is
the
class
action
which
in
the
advisory
opinion
was
deemed
suitable
to
test
taxpayers'
questions
on
the
bond
issue--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--no.
no...
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor,
(b)(1),
not
(b)(2).
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
(b)(1)
is
an
appropriate
vehicle--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
as
well
as
rule
23
of
the
alabama
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
are
exactly
identical.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
this
suit,
the
bedingfield
case
represents
a
stepping
stone
along
the
evolution
of
english
bills
of
peace,
justice
story's
equity
class
actions
in
the
19th
century--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
it
was--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--that
is
the
important
distinction
here,
your
honor,
if
i
may
make
that.
there
is
essentially
no
difference
whatsoever
between
the
bedingfield
case
and
if
this
had
been
a
class
action
brought
and
certified
under
alabama
rule
23,
paragraph
(b)(1),
and
there
are--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--but
it
was
a
class
action.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
in
the
name--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--no.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
no,
but
it
did
not
need
to
be
in
order
to
be
so
treated
for
due
process
purposes,
and
that's
the
precise
point.
if
we
can
go
through
and
compare
the
cases--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--the
distinction
between
due
process
and
mullane
v.
central
hanover
bank
is
that
the
holders
of
the
trust,
common
trust
interest
in
that
case
were
not
represented
by
anybody.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
you
have--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--and
that
element
to
some
degree
was
used
by
the
court
as
a
justification
for
not
requiring
a
stricter
standard
of
notice.
the
idea
that
some
of
the
people
would
in
fact,
local
people
in
new
york
received
the
notice,
but
nonetheless
they
felt
that
due
process
required
going
the
extra
distance
in
that
case.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
justice
breyer,
neither
under
(b)(1)
or
(b)(2)
of
rule
23
is
notice
required.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
the
explanation
of
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
history
of
rule
23
and
the
version
that
existed
from
1938
to
1966.
that
version
was,
in
fact,
merely
a
codification
of
the
kind
of
historic
equity
class
action
that
had
been
governed
by
this
court's
rule
48
and
then
rule
38.
it
did
not
require
any
kind
of
certification
for
a
class,
nor
did
it
require
any
kind
of
notice.
the
nature
of
the
class
was
defined
by
the
jural
relationships
between
the
members,
by
their
common
identity,
if
you
will,
in
terms
of
their
interests
which
were
to
be
adjudicated.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
and
it
was
binding.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
the
notice
provisions
of
current
federal
rule
23
and
all
of
the--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--neither
to
(b)--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--neither
to
(b)(1)
nor
(b)(2).
your
honor,
my--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--i
think
that
provision
of
the
rule
is
a
very
useful
admonition
and
a
very
cautionary
one,
and
a
very
valuable
tool
in
the
management
of
class
actions,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
mandatory
for
due
process
analysis
where
you
have
plaintiffs,
representative
parties
who
truly
represent
the
class
in
a
public
and
impersonal
question
of
the
kind
implicated
in
this
case,
namely,
just
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
tax.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
i
submit,
justice
scalia,
and
i
believe
the
historical
precedent
for
this
kind
of
suit
is
on
my
side,
that
in
this
kind
of
case
there
is
really
only
a
pure
public
question
in
a
purely
legal
sense.
not
in
terms
of
the
economic
consequences
of
the
tax,
or
the
differences
in
burden
that
may
result
from
its
application,
but
for
purposes
of
the
litigation
of
the
pure
legal
question,
there
are
no
private
rights
involved,
and
therefore--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
well,
the
fact--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--well,
i
agree,
your
honor,
it
is
a
kind
of--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
you
have
put
your
finger
on
the
essential
due
process
issue
in
this
whole
case,
and
the
one
that
we
would
submit,
if
it
is
due
for
remand,
that
would
be
the
first
question
that
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
determine,
namely
the
adequacy
of
the
representation
in
bedingfield.
with
regard
to--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--yes--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--to
a
limited
extent
in
this
kind
of
case,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--and--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--the
litigation--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--the
litigation
of
purely
public
questions
that
are
necessary
to
the
operation
of
state
and
local
government
with
some
degree
of
reliability
and
finality.
i
understand--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--many,
your
honor.
you
mentioned
several
earlier.
for
example,
the
validity
of
the
process
by
which
bonds
are
issued,
the
validity
by
which
a
tax
is
levied
and
collected.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
many,
but--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--more
so
with
regard
to
those
that
govern
the
nature
of
state
and
local
government,
and
i
can't
give
you
an
ironclad
rule
to
sort
them
out,
but--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--it
does
not
govern
the
nature
of
government,
your
honor.
it
is
merely
a
kind
of
issue
that...
the
levy
of
a
tax
is
totally
useless
to
a
local
government
if
it
can
be
challenged
in
endless
litigation.
now,
admittedly,
stare
decisis
after
a
certain
point
may
provide
relief,
but
it
has
been
the
historic
anglo
american
practice
to
use
res
judicata
in
this
context
rather
than
stare
decisis.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
no,
that's...
absolutely
not.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
because
of
the
nature
of
the
representational
suit,
whether
it
be
formally,
structurally
certified
as
a
class
so
that
the
representative
proceeds
under
those
rules,
or
whether
it
proceeds
in
the
manner
represented
by
hansberry
v.
lee,
and
which
was
prior
to
the
adoption
of
state
rules--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--those
who
verge
on
the...
on
legal
anarchy
i
think
would
advocate
that,
and
there
is
a
strong--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--i
cannot
distinguish
all,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
the
very
class
of
case
that
we're
talking
about
today,
cases
which
need
to
determine
with
some
degree
of
finality
and
reliability
state
and
local
government
issues
do
need
the
possibility
of
class
adjudication,
whether
it
be
in
the
traditional
form
which
i
say
the
bedingfield
case
was,
or
certified
as
a
(b)(1)
or
(b)(2)
class,
as
the
petitioners
seek
to
do
in
this
case.
in
either
case,
it
would
constitute
a
final
litigation
of
the
matter,
and
would
enable
government
to
proceed
without
the
constitutional
cloud
of
uncertainty
hanging
over
its
head.
in
that
respect,
i
think
class
actions
are
very
useful,
though
they
do
conflict
with
this
tradition
in
a
free
society
that
justice
scalia
was
talking
about.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
well,
as
i
mentioned
in
our
brief,
justice
stevens,
we
are
not
going
to
insist
on
claim
preclusion
in
this
case.
i
think
an
adequate
argument
can
be
made
for
issue
preclusion
on
the
equal
protection
case.
and
admittedly...
admittedly,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where,
if
a
matter
in
question,
for
example,
the
proper
procedure
for
a
bond
issue
had
not
been
followed
and
the
prior
test
case
only
dealt
with
the
legality
of
its
purpose,
then
clearly
the
second
case
would
not
be
blocked.
but
in
this
case,
the
county,
bond
attorneys,
everyone
relied
upon
the
fact
that
the
equal
protection
argument
had
been
raised
in
the
earlier
case,
and
assuming
that
it
was
a
class
action
that
had
the
same
preclusive
effect
as
a
(b)(1)
class
action,
it
was
deemed
to
be
res
judicata
with
regard
to
that--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
present
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
customary
rule
with
regard
to
judgments
is
that
if
an
issue
was
raised
by
the
litigants,
whether
or
not
the
evidence
was
sufficient,
or
whether
or
not
the
court
specifically
addressed
it,
if
it
was
consistent
with
the
judgment
and
a
contrary
position
would
have
negated
the
judgment,
then
the
decision
of
that
issue
is
merged
in
the
judgment.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
your
honor,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
in
that
argument,
and
for
that
purpose
we
cited
grubb
v.
public
service
commission
of
ohio,
was
that
as
a
rule
of
decision,
not...
having
nothing
to
do
with
res
judicata,
just
what
first
of
all
was
decided,
before
we
get
to
whether
or
not
that
decision
precluded
anything,
the
proper
rule
is
that
the
equal
protection
question
was
decided
in
the
case.
now,
whether
it
should
then
have
preclusive
effect
either
on
a
res
judicata
or
on
an
issue
preclusion
basis
was
a
different
question.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
you're
absolutely--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--on
that
point,
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
if
we
cannot
persuade
this
court
that
the
appropriate
rule
of
decision
was
that
the
equal
protection
question
was,
in
fact,
decided
by
bedingfield,
then
we
may
indeed
be
vulnerable,
unless
the
representational
nature
of
the
class
action
of
the
suit
is
sufficient
to
invoke
the
broader
standard
of
claim
preclusion.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
no,
i
did
not,
your
honor,
and
that
is
precisely
the
reason
why
in
the
brief
i
said
that
perhaps
the
alabama
supreme
court
painted
too
broadly
with
the
claim
preclusion
brush
for
purposes
of
due
process,
and
that
it
might
be
more...
a
kinder
and
gentler
due
process
application
if,
in
fact,
it
were
limited
to
issue
preclusion.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
well,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
this
notice,
i
can
answer
nothing,
other
than
usage
that
has
been
sanctioned
for
many
years
as
a
settled
practice
meets
the
requirements
of
due
process,
because
in
fact,
if
you
examine
the
history
of
this
kind
of
representational
suit
in
equity,
the
precursor
of
rule
23
between
1938
and
1966
and
its
present
operation
with
regard
to
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
classes,
which
are
the
suitable
vehicle
for
this
kind
of
public
issue,
notice
is
not
required
in
order
to
establish
a
class
that
is
binding
on
all
of
the
members
of
that
class,
provided
that
there
has
been
fair
and
adequate
representation
of
the
class
interest.
and
that
was
the
issue
in
hansberry
v.
lee,
which
i
submit
governs
this
case
completely.
first
of
all--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--just
the
necessity
of
going
through
the
relitigation
of
this
particular
case
again,
your
honor,
and
the
fact
that
if
someone
doesn't
like
the
opinion
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
that
case,
yet
another
plaintiff
may
bring
the
public
law
equivalent
of
a
strike
suit.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
but,
your
honor,
i
think
you
would
acknowledge
that
there
is
always
a
little
bit
more
of
a
chink
to
get
through
the
opening
provided
by
stare
decisis
than
there
is
with
res
judicata,
because
the
law
evolves,
and
that
is
taken
into
account
with
stare
decisis.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
more
wriggle
room,
because
you
have
more
cases.
it
is
not
the
authority
of
the
single
prior
case,
but
all
of
the
cases
that
may
be
of
a
similar
nature
that
are
to
be
taken
into
account
for
stare
decisis.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
if
he
was
represented
adequately
in
the
class,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
well,
the
most--
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
--yes.
i
think
the
southwest
airlines
case
versus
the
texas
international
case
is
very
much
on
point
in
that
regard,
justice
stevens,
because
the
privity,
if
you
will,
was
created
in
that
case
by
the
identity
of
interest
in
the
single,
narrow
legal
issue
that
was
presented,
which
was
the
litigation
of
the
validity
of
a
dallas
ordinance
prohibiting
the
use
of
love
field,
and
it
had
been
decided
earlier
that
that
ordinance
violated
texas
law.
all
of
the
airlines
who
wanted
to
exclude
southwest
from
love
field
had
a
tremendous
economic
interest,
but
the
court
held
that
they
were
precluded
from
further
litigating
that
question
because
their
legal
as
opposed
to
their
economic
interest
was
indistinguishable
from
that
of
the
city
of
dallas
and
others
who
had
litigated
the
same
public
question
before,
and
that
is
a
case,
i
think,
that
meets
your
criteria.
now,
they
had
notice,
though,
in
the
sense
of
actual
notice,
because
of
all
the
publicity
attending
the
case,
but
not
necessarily
legal
notice
within
the
procedural
requirements
of
rule
23.
as
i
said
earlier,
i
believe
that
this
case
is
really
governed
by
hansberry
v.
lee,
which
stood
for
several
very
fundamental
points.
one,
i
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
it
said
the
states
are
free,
subject
to
federal
due
process,
to
devise
any
kind
of
procedural
vehicle
for
representational
suits
they
desire.
secondly,
those
representational
suits
will
bind
the
members
of
the
class
who
are
represented.
thirdly,
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
if
the
representative
of
the
class
has
a
conflict
of
interest
or
does
not
adequately
represent
the
members
of
the
class,
and
that
was
a
specific
holding
in
hansberry
v.
lee,
and
finally,
hansberry
v.
lee
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
question
of
adequate
and
fair
representation
in
this
kind
of
suit
is
a
matter
for
retroactive
examination
by
the
courts
when
res
judicata
becomes
a
question.
and
in
that
regard,
it
is
consistent
with
the
principle
of
rule
23
that
the
certification
of
a
class
does
not
establish
its
preclusive
effect
for
the
future.
mr.
william
m.
slaughter
thank
you.
