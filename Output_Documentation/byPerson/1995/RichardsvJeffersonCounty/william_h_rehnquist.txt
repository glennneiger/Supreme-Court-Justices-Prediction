chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-386,
jason
richards
v.
jefferson
county.
mr.
baxley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
state
of
alabama
decides
to
authorize
taxpayer
suits
not
in
the
sense
of
people
who
are
being
subject
to
a
tax,
but
in
the
sense
of
challenging
expenditure
of
public
money?
in
other
words,
any
person
in
the
state
who
pays
taxes
may
challenge
the...
and
i
think
many
states
have
this.
do
you
think
a
state
has
to
allow
more
than
one
of
those
suits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
there
really
isn't
any
personal
property
interest
at
stake.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
i
don't
believe
that's
responsive
to
my
question.
listen,
please.
my
question
was,
if
the
state
says,
we're
going
to
authorize
taxpayer
suits,
any
taxpayer
can
come
in
and
claim
that
the
public
moneys
are
being
misspent,
and
a
comes
in
and
brings
a
taxpayer
suit
saying
that
you...
this
is
a
violation,
say,
of
the
first
amendment,
the
religion
clause,
for
the
state
to
spend
money
this
way,
and
then
that's...
the
highest
court
in
the
state
decides
that
case
against
that
taxpayer.
and
then
taxpayer
b,
who
wasn't
a
party
to
that
suit
at
all,
comes
in
and
says,
now,
i
wasn't
a
party
to
that
suit,
i'm
bringing
a
taxpayer's
action
to
challenge
that
same
expenditure
of
money
under
the
same
provision
of
the
constitution.
now,
can
a
state
say,
we're
just
not
going
to
do
that,
this
is
a
special
kind
of
suit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
talking
about
stare
decisis.
i'm
talking
about,
maybe
it's
a
brand
new
supreme
court
of
alabama
now,
and
maybe
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
might
be
inclined
to
depart
from
its
earlier
ruling,
but
can
the
state
simply
say,
we're
not
going
to
entertain
this
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
law
of
alabama
is
that
anything
that
was...
might
have...
was
raised
in
the
first
taxpayer's
action
might
have
been
raised
is
just,
it's
all
over,
there
isn't
going
to
be
another
suit,
does
that
violate
some
provision
of
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
held...
are
you
talking...
you
say,
held
that.
you
suggest
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
the
hypothetical
example
i've
given
you
it
violates
due
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
name
of
your
missouri
case,
mr.
baxley?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
it...
i
don't
see
it
in
the
index
to
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
sounds
like
a
case
in
which
the
employees
and
the
employers
all
had
some
property
interest
that
was
being
taken
away
from
them
by
the
tax.
i
mean,
they
were
being
able...
they
were
being
required
to
pay
the
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
it
is,
but
the
questions
we
have
been
propounding
to
you
are...
which
you
simply
haven't
responded
to,
at
least
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
are
the
other
situations,
where,
as
justice
ginsburg
puts
it,
you
have
a
taxpayer's
action
where
the
taxpayer
is
really
a
private
attorney
general
saying,
we
don't
like...
we
think
this
money
is
being
spent
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
even
though
they
suffer
no
particularized
injury,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
kind
of
a
case
isn't
perhaps
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
typically
it
would
be
a
statute
allowing
a
challenge
to
the
issue
of
municipal
bonds,
or
something--
--sure.
--where
the
bonds
are
going
to
be
sold,
and
they
need
a
declaratory
judgment
in
advance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
baxley.
mr.
slaughter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
purely
public
question,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
validity
of
any
state
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
why
does
a
county
occupation
tax
govern
the
nature
of
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
slaughter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baxley,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baxley.
the
case
is
submitted.
