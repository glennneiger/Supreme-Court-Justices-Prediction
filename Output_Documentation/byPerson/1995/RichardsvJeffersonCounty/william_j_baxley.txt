mr.
william
j.
baxley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
res
judicata
due
process
question
that
we're
here
on
today.
to
lead
in,
i'd
like
to
give
a
short
quote
out
of
a
case
of
chase
national
bank
v.
norwalk.
justice
brandeis
said,
unless
duly
summoned
to
appear
in
a
legal
proceeding,
a
person
not
a
privy
may
rest
assured
that
a
judgment
recovered
therein
will
not
affect
his
legal
rights.
that
quote
was
also
cited
by
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
martin
v.
wilks
case
and
quoted
along
with
some
other
quotes
from
justice
brandeis
in
that
case.
the
second
little
lead
in
quote
i'd
like
to
give...
because
it
was
cited,
the
case
was
cited
by
the
respondent.
it's
a
fifth
circuit
case,
southwest
airlines
v.
texas
international,
and
they
quoted
judge
widdeson
as
saying,
quote,
denial
of
the
opportunity
to
bring
a
suit
raises
serious
due
process
questions.
further
in
the
opinion,
they
quote,
again,
judge
widdeson,
because
res
judicata
denies
a
nonparty
his
day
in
court,
the
due
process
clause
prevents
preclusion
when
the
relationship
between
the
party
and
the
nonparty
becomes
too
attenuated.
in
this
instance,
it's
not
only
a
attenuated
relationship,
there's
a
nonexistent
relationship.
there's
absolutely--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--all
of
those
cases
that
they
cited
in
that
footnote,
only
two
or
three
of
them
do
i
think
really
have
application
that
they
should
have
to
be
arguable.
all
of
them
are
state
cases.
i
believe
all
of
them
are
state
cases.
i
don't
believe
there's
a
single
case
from
this
court
or
even
a
circuit
court
that
they
cited
in
that
footnote.
i
think
common
sense
is
the
best
answer.
these
are
cases
that
i
think
that
the
law,
especially
when
you're
dealing
with
a
constitutional
right
to
have
your
case
litigated--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i
think
the
position
that
we
would
take
is...
was
enunciated
in
your
dissent,
in
justice
o'connor's
dissent
in
the
harper
v.
virginia
case
which
is--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--but
it
did
not
conflict
with
the
majority,
either--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--and
you
quoted
united
states
v.
l.a.
tucker
trucking
company
and
webster
v.
fall,
and
i
think
your
quote
there
was
something
to
the
effect
that
questions
which
are
merely
lurk
in
the
record
have
no
basis
of
precedent
in--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--it
would
be
a
closer
question.
i
think
that--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i
think
you
could
make
a
good
argument
that
you
would
not,
because
of
nonprivity
under
the
law
as
set
out
by
this
court,
but
i
think
that...
certainly
i
think
that
candidly
the
respondent
would
have
a
stronger
case,
because
here
this
argument,
a
major
constitutional
right,
has
never,
ever
been
decided
by
any
court
at
any
time.
it's
never
been
argued.
it
was
mentioned
in
one
amicus
brief
at
the
alabama
supreme
court
level,
just
mentioned
in
passing.
you've
got
a
trial
court
that
wrote
a
five
or
six
page
opinion
that
never
touched
on
this
major
right.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
i
think
common
sensewise,
yes.
i
think
you
could
argue
that
the
claim...
i
don't
think
technically
under
the
law
that
either
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
would
apply.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
stare
decisis
i
think
would
be...
would
be
enough
to
where
it
would
make
your
burden
almost
unable...
you
couldn't
overcome
it,
but
i...
we
don't
have
that--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--not
having
been
litigated
in
any
way,
and
i
think
that's
the
law
from
this
court,
repeatedly.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
they
have
to--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i
think
my
answer
there
would
be
that
you
pretty
well
hit
it
on
the
head
in
martin
v.
wilks
in
your
opinion,
where
you
said
it's
really,
the
burden
is
on
the
parties,
on
the
parties
that
are
litigating
it
to
determine
what
the
issues
are
going
to
be.
when
this
issue
was
litigated
in
bedingfield,
if
the
county
had
really
wanted
to
come
in
and
have
the
due
process...
i
mean,
and
the
due
process
rights
provided
and
the
equal
protection
matter
settled
once
and
for
all,
they
could
have
brought
it
up.
they
know--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i
think
for
the
same
reason,
the
principle
of
stare
decisis
that
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i
don't
think
they
could
and
get
by
a
due
process
test
if
they
preclude...
now,
if...
in
your...
and
what...
your
example,
if
somebody
came
back
and
raised...
you
gave
the
first
amendment,
raised
the
first
amendment,
it
had
already
been
decided,
yes,
i
think
a
statute
that
set
that
out
would
preclude
others
from
doing
it.
but
if
then
they,
somebody
came
in
and
said,
now,
wait
a
minute,
this
has
not
been
decided
on
another
constitutional
ground,
then
i
don't
think
that
a...
i
think
a
state
statute--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--yes.
i
think
it
violates
due
process.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
because
this
court
has
held
basically
that
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
held
that
over
and
over,
repeatedly.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
if
you
deny
someone
the
right
to
fully
and
totally
litigate
a
constitutional
issue,
however
you
cut
him
off,
whether
by
case
law
or
by
a
statute,
then
it
would
not
meet
the
test
of
this
court,
that
this
court
says
the
due
process
rights
transcend
and,
so
to
speak,
would
overcome...
whether
it
be
case
law
at
the
state
level
or
a
state
statute--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--well,
i
think--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i
think
that
you
always
have
standing
if
you've
got
a
major
constitutional
right
that
you
say
is
being
infringed
upon.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
i
think
the
best
answer
there
is
a
case
of
this
court
of
waters
v.
st.
louis,
and
it's
so
parallel
to
the
situation
we
have
here.
the
legislature
of
missouri
passed
a
law
that
said
cities
of
over
700,000
people
can
impose
an
occupational
tax
on
businesses
and
individuals,
but
they
said
that
on
businesses
and
on
proprietors
that
ran
their
own
businesses
they
could
do
it
on
the
net
and
deduct
their
taxes.
before
the
tax
actually
went
into
effect,
a
taxpayer
in
missouri
filed
suit
on
constitutional
grounds.
it
got
to
this
court,
and
i
believe
it
was
justice
jackson
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i
think
that
the
state
does
not
have
the
right
to,
by
statute
or
any
other
way,
cut
off
someone's
right
to
litigate
a
constitutional
issue--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
we're
talking
about
real
taxpayers,
and
in
the
hansberry
v.
lee,
this
court
said
that
the
state
is
free
to
call
these
actions
whatever
they
want
to.
they
can
call
them
virtual
representation,
they
can
call
them
class
actions,
if
they
call
them
class
actions
they
can
set
certain
rules,
but
the
state
cannot...
whatever
they
call
them,
they
cannot
deny
someone's
due
process
rights
and--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i
think
they
absolutely
can,
but
i
also
think
you
go
back
to
the
decision
of
this
court
3
weeks
ago,
roughly,
in
the
matsushita
case,
where...
and
your
dissent,
you
say...
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg
dissent
says
that
a
state...
you
can
have
these
class
actions.
i
don't
think
this
part
of
it
conflicted
with
the
majority.
you
still,
even
in
a
consent
settlement
you've
got
to
make
sure
that
due
process
rights
of
the,
and
adequate
representation
and
things
of
that
nature,
that
they
still
have
got
to
be
fulfilled.
you
can't
cut
that
off
in
any
way.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
waters
v.
st.
louis,
and
there's--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--your
honor,
it's
in
our...
i
know
that
it's
in
our...
oh,
the
amicus...
the
amicus
found
this
case
for
us,
the
amicus
of
the
counties
found
that
case
and
had
that
in
their
green
brief,
and
then
we,
i
think,
cited
it
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
but
that
was
water
v.
st.
louis,
and
there
is
a
concurring
opinion,
two
sentences,
one
paragraph,
by
justice
douglas,
joined
in
by
justice
black,
where
justice
douglas
says
that
i'll
go
with
the
rest
of
the
court
on
the
reading
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
not
considered
this
scheme
right
now
so
it's
not
right,
but
when
it
comes
up
again
and
is
considered,
this
case...
but
i
bow
to
their
reading
of
the
record,
saving
for
a
future
day
the
serious
and
substantial
question
on
the
equal
protection
clause
raised
by
the
regulations
which
grant
employers
deductions
for
taxes
paid
the
federal
government,
yet
do
not
allow
employees
a
deduction
for
the
same
tax.
now,
when
this
first
case
came--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--that's
what
we
have
here,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
i
think
it
is
different.
i
think
it's
very
different.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
i
think
at
the
time
of
the
first
action
our
client
didn't
have
any
standing,
period,
because
the
scheme
had
not
gone
into
effect
yet.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
i
agree.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
your
honor,
you
can
find
for
us
on
any
basis.
[laughter]
yes,
sir,
i
would
concur
totally.
i
think
that
there
are
really
four
cases.
there's
another
case
that
i
think
is
very
much
in
point
about
bringing
this
up
again,
when
it
involves
a
basic
constitutional
right,
and
this
was
a
case
that,
again,
they
found
for
us.
respondents
cited
it.
it's
quong
wing
v.
kirkpatrick,
i
believe,
the
montana
case,
and
they
cited
it
i
suppose
because
it
looked
like
it
was
a
horrible
case
for
us
on
the
equal
protection
issue,
but
when
i
read
that
case,
lo
and
behold,
justice
holmes...
it
was
a
case
where
the
state
of
montana
had
imposed
a
what
looked
like
blatantly
discriminatory
tax
aimed
at
the
chinese
laundries.
and
justice
holmes
mentioned
in
the
opinion
that
in
oral
argument
he
tried
to
ask
the
counsel
that
was
arguing
about
the
equal
protection
issue
and
counsel
wouldn't
respond,
denied
it,
might
have
been
asleep
like
i
was
when
justice
scalia
was
asking
me.
but
justice
holmes
said
in
his
opinion,
he
said
that
we
brought
this
up,
this
is
going
to
come
up
again,
and
when
it
does
come
up
again,
and
laws
are
frequently
attacked
by...
that
the
lawyers
don't
give
the
court
anything
to
sustain
them
and
we
don't
want
to
sustain
them,
but
when
this
issue
comes
up
again,
when
it's
properly
attacked,
because
it's
a
constitutional
issue,
that
if
it
comes
up
again
we're
going
to
rule
with
them.
so
i
would
think
that
justice
holmes
would
be
wondering...
if
he
thought
that
that
opinion
would
be
cited
in
later
days
by
people
in
the
position
of
respondents,
saying
that
this
opinion
does
not
allow
the
same
party
to
attack
it
on
the
constitutional
issue...
he
said
they
could.
how
horrified
he
would
be
if
they
said
that
that
opinion
by
justice
holmes
prevented
every
future
american
of
chinese
ancestry
to
not
attack
a
ruling
on
that
basis
because
the
issue
could
have
been
raised
and
wasn't.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
it
was
raised...
it
was
alluded
to
in
the
complaint--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--it
was
alleged--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--it
was
not
passed
on
by
any
court,
and
i
would
cite
there--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
in
fact,
i
think--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i
don't
think
that
our
position
would...
we
might
take
that
position,
but
i
don't
think
our...
we
would
succeed.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
yes.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
not
privity.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
we've
got...
if
you
look
at
what...
issue
preclusion,
or
collateral
estoppel
doesn't
apply
here.
we
say
res
judicata
doesn't
apply.
in
fact,
i
think
this
thing
gets
back
to
justice
o'connor's
thing...
quote
in
that
harper
case
about
it
lurking
in
the
record.
it
lurked
in
the
record
here,
but
it
was
never
addressed.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
the
absence
of
privity
is
certainly
one
of
our
strong
arguments,
and
in
every...
almost
every
case
that's
cited
in
their
briefs
that
in
any
way
is
contrary
to
us
is...
where
you
did
have--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--i'm
sure
there
are,
but
this
is
not--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--what
we're
talking
about
here.
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
a
validation
suit.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
bond
validation
type
suits.
your
honor,
i've
thought
about
that,
and
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
here.
i
think
certainly
you
could
have
one
challenge,
but
however,
i
think
you've
got
to
look
at
what
hansberry
v.
lee
says,
and
the
danger
of
collusion,
that
you
don't
want
to
okay
in
advance
one
challenge
where
there's
possible
collusion,
a
friendly
type
suit
to
validate--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
no.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
because
the...
i
don't
think
you
can
cut
off
someone's
right
to
litigate
a
constitutional
issue
that's
affecting
them,
and...
but
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
this
is
not
an
action
that
was
allowed
by
statute.
it
just
came
on
a
declaratory
judgment.
and
also,
one
important
thing,
and
it
goes
back
to
the
question
justice
stevens
asked,
the
complaint
in
bedingfield,
the
first
action
here,
never
at
any
time
was
there
any
attack
made
on
the
exemption
scheme.
it
had
not
even
gone
into
effect
yet.
probably
most
people
didn't
even
understand
it
at
the
time,
because
the
tax
hadn't
started
taking
effect
yet,
and
so
no
one
ever,
even
though
it
was
in
the
complaint
with
the
equal
protection
part,
nobody
has
ever
attacked
the
exemption
scheme
until
the
instant
case
right
here,
and
we
submit
there
are
some
possibilities
that
perhaps
it
would
have
been
premature
at
the
time
bedingfield
came
on,
since
the
tax
was
not
being
collected.
it
indicates
that
in
justice
jackson's
opinion
in
the
st.
louis
case.
it
might
have
been
premature
to
have
attacked
the
exemption
scheme
as
early
as
they
did.
justice
jackson
mentions--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--nobody
had
been
collecting
it
from
them
yet.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
yes.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
that
was
just
mentioned
in
the
st.
louis
case,
and
the
exemption
scheme
was
definitely
never
even
attacked.
if
i
could
be
permitted
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
william
j.
baxley
no
question,
bedingfield
was
not
a
class.
nobody
ever
considered
it
one,
and
contrast
the
lack
of
notice
there
with
what
was
deemed
not
sufficient
in
martin
v.
wilks,
where
there,
you
had
the
birmingham
firefighters
association
that
appeared,
these
later
plaintiffs
were
members
of
the
association,
the
court
ordered
that
notice
be
published
in
both
birmingham
newspapers
for,
i
think,
30
days
or
so,
they
solicited
opinions,
asked
everybody
to
come
in,
these
organizations
represented
these
people,
you
had
much,
much
more
notice
type
in
the
martin
v.
wilks
than
you
had
here,
where
you
had
none,
zero.
secondly,
it
could
have
been
a
class.
the
county,
if
they
had
wanted
it
to
barr
everything
forever,
they
could
have
come
in...
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
were
in
effect
in
alabama
for
class
actions
10
or
12
years
before
bedingfield.
the
county
didn't
want
to
do
that.
they
didn't
want
to
make
it
a
class.
they
hoped
nobody
would
ever
raise
legal
protection.
they
didn't
want
to
litigate
it
then,
they
don't
want
to
litigate
it
today,
they
don't
wan
to
litigate
it
tomorrow,
but
that's
the
party
that
should
have
made
it
that
way
by
your
dicta,
or
your
ruling
of
both
parties
are
the
ones
that
best
know.
and
lastly,
in
the
southwest
airlines
case
that
he
mentioned
just
then,
that
was
a
very
different
situation
that
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
in
that
instance.
the
attorneys
for
the
parties
that
were
"nonparties"
also
filed
amicus
briefs.
they
attended
the...
they
sat
through
the
actual
first
proceeding,
there
was
a
lot
of
different
fact
situations
different
in
the
southwest
airlines
case
than
here,
where
you
had
absolutely
no
relationship--
mr.
william
j.
baxley
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
