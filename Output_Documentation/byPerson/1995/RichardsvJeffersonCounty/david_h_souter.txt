justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
wouldn't
you
still
claim
that
there
was
no
privity?
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
not
alleged
here,
is
it?
you
don't
have
to
get
into
that,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not--
--all
you
have
to
worry
about
is
the
suit
by
the
taxpayer
who
is
actually
paying
the
tax--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
that's
what
you've
got,
and
you're
claiming
that
in
those
cases--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you've
got
to
have
some
privity
for
a...
issue
or
claim
preclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
claims
that
he's
not
attacking
class
actions.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
his
point
is
that
there
is
no
legitimate
sense
in
which
this
can
be
called
a
representational
suit.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
is
claiming
that
his
clients
want
to
sue
simply
as
taxpayers.
they
were
not
in
privity
with
any
other
taxpayers
who
were
sued
and,
in
fact,
they
want
to
sue
on
an
issue
which
was
not
litigated,
and
he
is
saying
that
in
no
sense
can
you
call
a
prior
action
a
representational
suit
as
to
my
clients.
i
think
that's
as
far
as
his
argument
goes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
only
goes
to
res
judicata.
that
does
not
apply
in
a
claim
preclusion
situation.
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg's
very
question
is,
i
think,
that
if
you
are
going
to
insist
on
the
position
that
they
are
cut
off
on
an
issue
which
was
not,
in
fact,
litigated,
even
though
it
may
have
been
raised,
then
you've
got
to
rest
your
case
on
res
judicata,
not
on
issue
preclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
that's
the
reason
for
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
my
question.
if
you
are
saying,
as
i
thought
you
were
saying,
that
you
didn't
insist
on
res
judicata,
that
you
were
satisfied
to
rely
on
issue
preclusion,
then
you
lose,
it
seems
to
me,
on
any
claim
of
issue
preclusion
on
the
res
judicata
point,
because
it
was
not,
in
fact,
litigated.
it
was
merely
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
have
cut
off
the
parties
to
the
first
case,
but
it
is
not
going
to
cut
off
anyone
else.
