are
there
other
provisions...
what
other
statutes
or
rules
of
law
in
montana
require
other
kinds
of
clauses
besides
arbitration
clauses
to
be
typed
in
underlying
capital
letters
on
the
first
page
of
a
contract?
justice
breyer
what
are
they?
justice
breyer
what
are
they?
justice
breyer
well,
i
mean,
that
would
be
the
question.
if
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
provisions
like
this,
and
this
is
not
different,
then
i
guess
it
isn't
just
for
arbitration,
and
if,
in
fact,
this
seems
to
be
quite
different,
or
there
are
only
a
handful,
then
it
does
seem
different
just
for
arbitration.
justice
breyer
so
which
is
it?
i
mean,
i'm
sure
i'm
going
to
hear
the
argument,
in
a
few
minutes,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things.
justice
breyer
yes.
justice
breyer
suppose
i
didn't
agree
with
you
about
that.
suppose
i
thought
that
just,
well,
look
at
the
other
things
on
the
list,
and
if
there
are
a
lot
of
things
on
the
list,
maybe
it's
just
treating
them
like
that,
and
if
there
are
only
one
or
two
or
three,
and
they
look
different,
then
they're
singling
out
arbitration.
all
right,
on
that
assumption,
how
would
you
argue
this?
i
mean,
i'm--
justice
breyer
--because--
justice
breyer
--the
other
things
being--
justice
breyer
--what
are
those?
i
mean,
do
you
want
to
say
anything
else
about
those
other
things?
justice
breyer
the
other
things
you
can
waive,
one
is
jury
trial.
are
there
other
important
things
you
want
to
list
that
they
can
waive
in
montana?
justice
breyer
and
the
other
members
of
that
class
are?
justice
breyer
and
the
ones
that
are
in--
justice
breyer
--i
mean,
is
that
listed
in
your...
what
i'd
need
would
be,
if
we're
to
look
at
it
as
a
whole,
is
the
list
of
provisions
that
don't
have
to
do
with
arbitration,
where
the
law
of
montana,
whether
judge
made--
justice
breyer
--or
legislature
made,
does,
in
fact,
require
notice
roughly
similar
to
underlined
capital
letters
on
the
first
page
of
a
contract,
not
that
that
has
to
be
just
in
those
words.
justice
breyer
where
is
that
list?
i
found
a
few
things.
justice
breyer
my
guess
is...
i
would
assume,
perhaps,
that
since
you
went
through
this,
that
the
reason
that
there
isn't
a
comprehensive
list
is
you
weren't
able
to
find
many
things.
justice
breyer
or
in
the
incorporation
of
california
law,
or
any
place...
i
mean,
you've
looked
at
this
pretty
thoroughly...
it's
a
good
brief...
and
so
my
guess
is,
there
just
aren't
that
many
things.
justice
breyer
well,
do
you
have
in
your
brief
on
this
the
list
of
other
cases
decided
on
this
basis,
or
this
background
rule,
so
that
we're...
i
mean,
this
started
with
terminex--
justice
breyer
--like
the
termites,
it
keeps
sort
of
coming
back.
what
i--
