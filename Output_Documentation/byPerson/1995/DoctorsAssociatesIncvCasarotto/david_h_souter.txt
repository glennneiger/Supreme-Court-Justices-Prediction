justice
souter
but
going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
if
we
knew
for
a
fact
that
her
choice
of
forum
limitation
did
not...
did
not
really
bear
on,
or
have
application
to
arbitration
agreements
to
any
degree
beyond
their
application
to
any
other
choice
of
forum
agreements,
if
we
knew
that
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
aimed
at
arbitration
agreements,
that
it
was
being
enforced
sort
of
evenhandedly
with
all
choice
of
forum
agreements,
and
that
there
were
plenty
of
choice
of
forum
agreements
which
were
not
arbitration
agreements,
in
that
case
we
would
say,
that's
general
enough,
and
that
wouldn't
violate
the
faa--
justice
souter
--so
should...
may
it--
justice
souter
--no,
you
go
ahead.
justice
souter
well,
are
you
saying,
then,
that
there
can
be
no...
there
can
be
no
general
rule
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
that
refers
to,
in
substantive
terms
to
the
kind
of
provision
that
it
applies
to?
in
other
words,
the
state
law
says,
no
agreements
without
offer
and
acceptance.
we
can
certainly
find
that
an
arbitration
agreement
fails
for
lack
of
offer,
or
lack
of
acceptance.
justice
souter
but--
justice
souter
--but
then
it
becomes
complicated
when
you
get
to
examples
in
which
there's
a
whole
series
of
terms
upon
which
it
may
turn,
and
i
think
you're
saying,
but
i'm
not
sure,
no
matter
how
long
that
series
might
be,
as
in
justice
breyer's
example,
as
long
as
there
is
a
substantive
reference
to
arbitration,
that
it
would
fail.
are
you
saying
that?
justice
souter
or
that
the
arbitration
clause
itself
got
in
there
because
of
unconscionable
contracts.
justice
souter
yes.
justice
souter
but
you
want
to
make
the
arbitration
agreement
more
consensual
than
other
forms
of
the
con...
other
elements
of
the
contract,
that's
your
problem,
not
that
they
want
to
make
it
consensual,
but
they
want
to
make
it
more
consensual,
hyperconsensual,
isn't
that
your
difficulty?
justice
souter
but
i--
justice
souter
--but
i
don't
think
we
can
really
deal
with
that
hypothesis
based
on
what
you
give
us,
because
if
we...
if
it
were
shown
on
the
record
that
this
concept
of
the
unexpected
turned
out
to
be
a
concept
which
is
either
applied
in
sort
of
an
undisciplined
fashion
by
courts
so
that
it
could
be
used
to
single
out
arbitration,
or
if
it
was
shown
that
it
was
applied
in
a
way
which,
by
whatever
set
of
principles,
the
state
courts
were...
tended
to
fall
heavily
on
arbitration,
or
if
it
could
be
shown
that
it
was
intended
as
a
common
law
rule
really
to
apply
to
arbitration
and
make
it
more
difficult,
we
would
say
that
there
was
not,
in
fact,
a
sufficient
generality
there,
and
that
therefore
the
rule,
the
unexpectedness
concept
would
fail
because
it
wasn't
sufficiently
general,
and
we
just
don't
know
enough,
i
guess,
even
if
we
had
the
case
that
you
hypothesize,
to
know
how
we
would
rule
on
that.
justice
souter
but
isn't
there
a
policy
answer
to
that?
in
other
words,
shouldn't
we
say,
just
on
the
hypothesis
that
you
give
us,
that
we
would
not...
we
should
not
recognize
a
state
policy
which
brands
as
unexpected
a
form
of
adjudification...
adjudication
which
it
is
federal
law
and
policy
to
promote?
justice
souter
well,
yes,
but
on
your
assumption,
your
assumption
is
that
the
arbitration
clause
may
properly
be
found
to
be
unexpected
within
the
meaning
of
the
montana,
either
common
law
rule
or
statutory
rule,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that,
in
and
of
itself,
is
at
odds
with
federal
policy.
justice
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
leave
the
question
justice
breyer
raised,
and
that
is,
in
giving
the
answer
that
you
could
to
his
question,
you
were
giving
some
examples
that
at
least...
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
what
you
were
saying,
but
they
didn't
seem
to
suggest
to
me
that
they
would
be
an
appropriate
part
of
the
series
of
unexpected
terms.
for
example,
you
mentioned
the
terms
of
a
retail
installment
contract.
what
would
be
unexpected
in
buying
a
refrigerator
on
the
installment
plan
in
the
fact
that
there
were
terms
governing
the
installment
payments?
what's
unexpected
about
that?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
concept
these
examples
are
pointing
to
is
something
other
than
unexpectedness.
justice
souter
but
if
that
is
an
example
of
the
series,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
arbitration
is
being
analogized
with
high,
if
not
quite
unconscionable
interest,
and
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
series...
whatever
the
adjective
the
state
uses,
it
sounds
like
a
series
of
disfavored
terms,
not
unexpected
terms.
