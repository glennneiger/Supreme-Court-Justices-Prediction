justice
stevens
they
applied
the
statute.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your...
but
i--
justice
stevens
--you
may
welcome
a
different
question.
is
it
your
view--
[laughter]
--that
the...
upon
remand,
supposing
we
agree
with
your
opponent
that
the
statute
is
unenforceable
because
it
clearly
singles
out
arbitration
agreements.
is
it
your
view
that
on
remand
the
montana
supreme
court
could
reinstate
its
order
saying
the
case
may
go
forward
in
montana
on
the
ground
that
we
have
a
common
law
principle
that
unexpected
provisions
have
to
be
conspicuous,
and
this
isn't
conspicuous?
justice
stevens
so
that
this
may
not
end
the
lawsuit
even
if
you
lose.
justice
stevens
what
the
montana
legislature
did
under
your
view
of
montana
law
was
just
superfluous,
that
they
could
have--
justice
stevens
--simply
repealed
the
prohibition
against
arbitration
agreements
and
the
montana
supreme
court
would
have
decided
this
case
precisely
the
same
way
on
this
background
principle
of
common
law
that
they
never
mentioned.
justice
stevens
this
is
a
proarbitration
statute.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
you
surely
will
make
the
same
argument
to
them
that
you
made
to
us.
i
don't
know
why
you'd
be
ashamed
of
doing
that.
justice
stevens
mr.
kravitz,
isn't
there
another
answer
to
my
suggestion,
namely
that
your
opponent
is
suing
on
the
contract,
aren't
they?
they're
claiming
a
breach
of
the
contract.
justice
stevens
so
they
can't
very
well
say
the
contract's
invalid.
they're
really
just
attacking
the
arbitration
clause.
