we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
85...
95-559,
doctor's
associates,
inc.,
v.
paul
casarotto.
mr.
kravitz.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
if
there
are
several
other
examples,
but
in
separate
part
of
the
statutes
it
still
shows
kind
of
an
ad
hoc
approach
to
each
particular
thing
rather
than
a
general
feeling
that
all
of
these
particular
things
should
be
subject
to
heightened
notice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kravitz.
ms.
sikes,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
wasn't.
yes,
but
it
wasn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
a
question
whether
it
discourages
arbitration
under
the
section
2.
the
thing
has
to
be
put
on
such
grounds
as
exist
in
law
or
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
montana
supreme
court
didn't
apply
that
judge
made
doctrine
here,
did
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
except
apparently
it
thought
that
only
arbitration
would
ever
be
unexpected.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there's
no
generality
to
the
statute.
it
simply
singles
out
arbitration.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
didn't
it
help
other
people
who
were
drafting
other
kinds
of
unexpected
provisions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
being
unexpected.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
did
the
supreme
court
of
montana
avoid
the
statute
in
that
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
are
the
other...
you're
talking
about
the
other
unexpected
things
other
than
arbitration,
and
has
the
supreme
court
of
montana
said
that
things
other...
provisions
other
than
montana,
other
than
arbitration
must
be
displayed
on
the
first
page
of
the
contract
in
capital
letters,
or
have
they
simply
invalidated
those
provisions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
then,
that
isn't
the
same
treatment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
that's
how
the
unexpectedness
doctrine
works
out
in
practice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
avoid
it,
you
put
it
on
the
front
page.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
you
put,
actually
the
important
terms
of
the
contract
on
the
other
pages.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
sikes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kravitz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
