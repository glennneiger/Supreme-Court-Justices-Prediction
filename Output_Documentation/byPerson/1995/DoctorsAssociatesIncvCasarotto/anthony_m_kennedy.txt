justice
kennedy
suppose
that
the
state
had
a
statute
which
said
that
the
following
terms
have
to
be
in
bold
face
type:
price,
term
of
the
contract,
choice
of
law,
add
a
few
more
if
you
can
think
of
them,
and
arbitration.
would
that
be
a
valid
state
law
that's
enforceable?
justice
kennedy
no,
this...
no...
well,
i'll
amend
the
hypothetical,
then.
it
applies
to
contracts
generally,
it
says.
justice
kennedy
all
written
contracts.
justice
kennedy
you
have
to
bold
face
type...
bold
face
type
for
price,
terms
of
the
contract,
choice
of
law,
arbitration.
justice
kennedy
and
whether
or
not
attorney's
fees
are
allowed.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
would
that
be--
justice
kennedy
isn't
the--
--of
course,
one
of
the
underlying
issues
here
is
that
in
these
cases
typically
one
party
will
say,
i
didn't
make
this
choice.
i
didn't
know
anything
about
it.
i
signed
this
thing.
if
we
are
concerned
that
this
is
happening
more
and
more,
do
the
federal
courts
have
the
authority
to
develop
a
law
of
adhesion
of
contracts
so
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
i
suppose
under
the
arbitration
clause,
the
courts
could
develop
certain
rules
to
protect
the
parties?
justice
kennedy
even
though
the
evil
sought
to
be
cured
is
peculiarly
related
to
arbitration
contracts.
justice
kennedy
there's
something
of
a
vacuum
then,
isn't
there.
justice
kennedy
under
that
formulation,
what
about
our
decision
in
volt?
justice
kennedy
that's
one
way
of
characterizing
it,
but
it
did
stay
the
arbitration
pending
judicial
proceedings--
justice
kennedy
--as
i
recall
the
case,
and
i'm...
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
or
not
those
judicial
proceedings
would
have
been
binding
on
the
arbitrator.
justice
kennedy
but
let's
for
a
moment
assume
that
they
would
have
been,
which
i
think
was
quite
a
plausible
conclusion.
justice
kennedy
and
if
the
parties
had
chosen
montana
law
what
would
your
result--
justice
kennedy
--then
volt
becomes
a
harder
case
for
you.
justice
kennedy
--they're
not
incompatible
categories,
are
they?
the
state
can
disfavor
that
which
is
unexpected--
justice
kennedy
--i
assume,
for
the
obvious
reasons
that
parties
will
have
their
legitimate
expectations,
or
what
they
felt
were
legitimate
expectations.
