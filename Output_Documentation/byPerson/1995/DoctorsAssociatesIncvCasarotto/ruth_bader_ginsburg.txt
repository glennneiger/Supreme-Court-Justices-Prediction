justice
ginsburg
mr.
kravitz,
suppose
it
were
concentrated,
the
clause
were
concentrated
on
the
forum
and
were
general.
suppose
it
read,
no
choice
of
forum
or
choice
of
law
clause
in
any
forum
contract
will
be
enforced
unless
notice
of
the
chosen
forum
is
typed
in
underlined
capital
letters.
so
it's
general,
all
contracts,
it's
any
choice
of
forum,
any
choice
of
law
clause.
justice
ginsburg
it
applies
to
all
contracts.
if
you
have
a
choice
of
law
or
choice
of
forum,
including
arbitration,
you
could
pick
the--
justice
ginsburg
--commercial
court
in
zurich.
justice
ginsburg
it
would
be
the
same
thing
as...
any
choice
of
forum
in
a
forum
contract,
so
it's
not
all
contracts,
its
just
in
forum
contracts.
justice
ginsburg
--suppose...
do
you
have
any
doubt
about
whether
such
a
provision
would
be
valid
as
to
choice
of
a
court?
suppose
the
state
said,
any
choice
of
a
judicial
forum--
justice
ginsburg
--any
choice
of
law
to
govern
this
contract
has
to
be
put
in...
on
page
1?
justice
ginsburg
well
then,
you
seem
to
be
saying
the
arbitration
act,
far
from
allowing
laws
of
general
application
to
apply,
says
a
law
of
general
application
about
choice
of
forum
can
apply
to
all
other
contracts
but
not
to
arbitration
contracts.
justice
ginsburg
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
saying
choice
of
forum
has
to
be
on
page
1?
justice
ginsburg
it's
not
overriding
the
choice,
it's
simply
a
notice
requirement.
justice
ginsburg
it's
simply
a
notice
requirement
that
you
notify
the...
in
the
forum
contract
you
put
certain
things
on
page
1,
and
one
is
choice
of
forum.
justice
ginsburg
--so
we're
not
talking
anything
about
the
rules--
justice
ginsburg
--no,
there's--
justice
ginsburg
--it's
a...
it
says
that
choice
of
forum
and
choice
of
law
go
on
page
1.
justice
ginsburg
mr.
kravitz,
you
answered
the
question
to
justice
breyer
that
it
would
be
the
same
outcome.
suppose
you
had
answered
the
other
way
to
my
question.
you'd
say,
choice
of
forum
as
a
general
matter
is
one
thing.
that's
not
what
this
montana
law
says.
it
says
arbitration.
justice
ginsburg
so
are
you
saying
i'm
raising
an
academic
question?
justice
ginsburg
could
there
be
an
arbitration
clause
in
a
forum
contract
that
could
be
held
unconscionable?
justice
ginsburg
or
enough
of
them.
justice
ginsburg
but
ms.
sikes,
can
you
explain
to
me
why
it's
unexpected?
arbitration
clauses
are
used
in
all
manner
of
formal
contracts.
it's
not
immediately
obvious
that
that
would
fit
within
the
definition
of
unexpected
terms.
justice
ginsburg
well,
they're
not--
justice
ginsburg
forum
selection
clauses
that
are
consented
to?
you--
justice
ginsburg
--and
then,
how
about
choice
of
law?
justice
ginsburg
but
if
litigation
is
actually
begun
in
the
forum
selected--
justice
ginsburg
--montana
would
have
no
choice
but
to
recognize
it.
justice
ginsburg
ms.
sikes,
how
about
the
problem
that
a
nationwide
merchant
has,
and
montana
says
page
1
in
capital
letters,
and
suppose
nevada
says,
page
3
and
bold
face...
these
are
form
contracts
that
are
prepared
so
they
could
be
used
in
every
state.
justice
ginsburg
but
there
you
said
it
was...
she
knew
about
it.
justice
ginsburg
all
right.
suppose
the
merchant
has
complied
with
california
law,
which
requires
on
the
first
page
but
in
ordinary
type,
and
the
person
never
read
the
contract,
never
knew
anything
about
arbitration.
justice
ginsburg
well,
that's
a
different
answer
than
the
one
you
gave
me
before.
justice
ginsburg
now
you're
saying
they
must
comply
with
divergent
laws--
justice
ginsburg
--so
they
can't
use
the
one
form.
justice
ginsburg
the
selected
forum
was
connecticut,
right?
they
were
going
to
have
arbitration
in
connecticut.
justice
ginsburg
could
a
connecticut
court,
state
or
federal,
if
there's
diversity,
instruct
the
parties
to
cease
and
desist
from
continuing
that
legislation
in
montana
because
they
have
bound
themselves
to
a
clause
that
says
arbitration?
would
a
connecticut
court
that...
whose
law
is,
we
give
effect
to
these
agreements,
say
to
the
parties
over
whom
it
has
jurisdiction,
stop
litigating
in
montana
on
pain
of
contempt
of
the
connecticut
court?
justice
ginsburg
well,
maybe
it
suggests
that
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
this
contract
has
to
be
treated
the
same
way
in
every
state.
justice
ginsburg
well,
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
this...
there
could
be
an
unseemly
confrontation
among
states
that
are
proarbitration
and
states
that
are
a
little
slow
at
getting
there
unless
there's
a
uniform
interpretation
to
the
federal
law,
so
that--
justice
ginsburg
--yes,
but
the
question
is,
how
can
you
really
argue
that
something
that
says
arbitration
is
general
grounds?
