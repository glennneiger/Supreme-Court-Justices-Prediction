mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
makes
written
provisions
valid,
irrevocable,
and
enforceable
except
for
grounds
that
apply
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
in
this
case,
however,
the
montana
supreme
court
refused
to
enforce
the
parties'
agreement
to
arbitrate
because
it
failed
to
comply
with
the
heightened
notice
statute
that,
by
its
plain
language,
applies
only
to
arbitration
agreements
and
not
to
other
contracts.
respondents
thus
have
tried
to
recast
montana's
notice
statute
as
codifying
some
general
principle
of
unexpectedness,
but
that
effort
fails
for
two
reasons.
first,
montana's
law
does
no
such
thing,
since
it
applies
to
only
one
type
of
provision,
arbitration
agreements,
and
it
applies
to
them
whether
they're
unexpected
or
not.
second,
the
faa
prevents
a
court
from
refusing
to
enforce
the
parties'
agreement
to
arbitrate
on
the
basis
of
a
state
law
principle
that
turns
on
the
fact
that
the
subject
matter
involved
is
arbitration.
thus,
under
the
faa,
a
state
may
not
decide,
as
montana
has
decided
here,
that
a
contract
is
fair
enough
to
enforce
its
basic
terms
but
not
fair
enough
to
enforce
its
arbitration
clause.
congress
enacted
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
clear
away
judicial
and
legislative
suspicion
of
arbitration,
in
and
so
doing,
congress
decided
for
itself
to
determine
the
circumstances
under
which
arbitration
clauses
would
be
enforceable,
unencumbered
by
state
law
constraints.
to
that
end,
the
text
of
section
2
alone
determines
the
enforceability
of
an
arbitration
agreement,
and
that
text
provides
that
arbitration
provisions
are
enforceable
and
valid
and
irrevocable,
save
for
one
explicit,
and
explicitly
limited,
exception:
upon
grounds
that
exist
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
we
believe
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
state
law
or
principle
fits
within
that
savings
clause,
two
considerations
are
paramount.
first,
the
savings
clause
is
an
exception
to
a
sweeping
general
rule
of
enforcement.
therefore,
the
court
must
be
on
its
guard
not
to
allow
the
exceptions
to
swallow
or
undercut
the
general
rule.
second,
section
2
establishes
a
principle
of
what
i'll
call
rigorous
equality
for
arbitration
clauses.
they
may
be
no
less
valid,
no
less
enforceable,
and
no
less
irrevocable
than
other
contract
terms
under
state
law.
as
a
result,
this
court
has
identified
two
tests
that
state
laws
or
principles
must
pass
before
a
law
fits
within
the
savings
clause.
first,
the
law
must
be
one
of
general
application.
that
is
to
say,
it
must
apply
to
contracts
generally.
secondly,
even
if
it
is
in
theory
a
general
principle
of
law,
the
particularized
application
of
that
general
principle
cannot
turn
on
the
fact
that
the
subject
matter
involved
is
arbitration.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
depending
upon
the
law,
the
nature
of
the
law
and
the
things
that
are
included,
i
think
not,
and
i
think
it
would
fail
really
under
two
principles.
first,
unless
the
list
was
quite
long,
it
would
not
apply
to
contracts
generally
but
just
apply
to
a
few
things,
and
secondly--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--right.
well,
it
applies
to
all
written
contract
terms?
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
okay,
and
does
it
apply
to--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--okay.
then
i
think
you
have
to
ask
yourself
really
the
second--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--of
course,
the
more
things
you
put
in
it,
the
more
it
looks
like
a
general
principle,
but
then
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
it
seems
to
me,
the
second
test,
which
is,
why
does
it
make
the
list?
why
does
arbitration
make
the
list,
and
if
it's
making
the
list
because,
of
course,
the
court
feels
that
they're
concerned
about
people
arbitrating
as
opposed
to
litigating
disputes,
they
think
that
they're
giving
up
an
especially
important
right,
then,
depending
upon
the
size
of
that
list,
it
may
still
fail
to
pass
the
second
principle,
that
the
court
has--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--well,
certainly
if
that...
if...
i
just
have
to
ask
one
more
question
about
that.
if
that
law
applies
only
to
choice
of
forums
that
are
in
arbitration
agreements--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--right.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
sure.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
that's--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--well,
it
would...
for...
i
believe
it
would
cause
the
same
problems
that
we're
addressing,
if
i
may
explain.
assuming
that
it
applies
just
to
both
litigation
and
arbitration,
it
begins
to
look
more
general.
however,
what
the
state
is
saying
in
that
circumstance,
the
circumstance
you're
positing,
is,
okay,
well,
we'll
let
you
arbitrate,
but
you
have
to
do
it
under
our
rules,
and
i
believe
that
when
the
court...
when
the
states
are
permitted
to
start
tinkering
with
the
parties'
choices
about
how
they
wish
to
arbitrate,
it
raises
many
of
the
same
concerns.
for
example,
if
the
court--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--right.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
the
faa
does
not
speak
to
such
clauses,
and
certainly
that
would
not
run
afoul
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
whether
there's
anything
else--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--what
i'm
saying
is,
your
honor,
and
obviously
the
hypothetical
you're
posing
is
very
different
from
the
statute,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
as
the
states
begin
to
tinker
with
the
parties'
choices
of
the
rules
under
which
they'll
conduct
their
arbitration,
you
begin
to
raise
the
same
issues.
for
example,
if
i
may,
if
a
state
said,
okay,
you
can
arbitrate,
but
you
have...
the
arbitrators
have
to
be
chosen
from
the
voter
rolls
in
a
certain
town,
and
you
have
to
have
12
arbitrators,
and
all
the
rules
of
evidence
have
to
apply--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--because
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
one
is
tinkering
with
the
choice
that
the
parties
made
of
the
method
in
which
they're
going
to
resolve
their
dispute,
that
it
raises
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
one
is
trying
to
interfere
with
the
parties'
choice
of
arbitration,
or
one
is
trying
to
do
something
else.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
text
of
section
2
provides
the
answer
to
that,
and
that
text
says
that
the
written
provisions
are
valid,
irrevocable,
and
enforceable,
whether
in
state
court
or
federal
court,
save
upon
grounds
that
exist
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract,
which
is
to
say
contracts
generally.
now,
this
court
in
perry
and
in
first
options
has
said
that
you
look
to
state
rule,
has
made
the
choice
that...
let
me
step
back,
said
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
therefore,
the
arbitration
agreement
is
valid
and
enforceable.
the
court
has
then
looked
to
state
principles
of
general
application
on
revocability,
but
it
has
done
that
because
the
statute
so
provides,
so
i
think
that
the
court
would
be
prohibited
from
developing
specialized
rules
under
some
sort
of
federal
common
law
designed
to
impose
on
arbitration
agreements
limitations
that
are
not
applicable
to
clauses
generally.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
yes,
even
though
the
evil
thought--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--well,
but
the
law
generally,
of
course,
is
that
all
of
the
terms
in
a
forum
contract,
an
adhesion
contract
are,
in
fact,
presumptively
valid,
if
you
put
your
signature
on
it,
so
that
in
fact
the
law
of
contracts
generally
would
say
these
are
valid,
and
that
law
of
contracts
generally
is
being
skewed
solely...
it's
singling
out
arbitration,
and
solely
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
arbitration
involved
as
opposed
to
something
else.
and
one
must
ask
oneself,
why
is
one
skewing
the
law
that
way,
and
it
is
because
one
is
making
a
value
judgment
that
arbitration
is
perhaps
less
good
than
a
court
proceeding,
or
the
like,
precisely
the
value
judgment
congress
sought
to
take
the
way
from
both
federal
courts
and
state
courts
and
state
legislatures
when
it
enacted
the
faa.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
certainly...
certainly
as
you
posit
it,
justice
souter,
it
sounds
general
enough,
but
i
would
ask
the
court
to--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--what
principal...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
well,
i
would
ask
the
question,
what
principle,
then,
would
determine
overriding
the
parties'
choice
of
where
they
arbitrate
in
that
case
from
choosing
the
aaa
rules,
which
provide,
for
example,
for
the
rules
of
evidence
don't
apply,
and
where
do
you
draw
the
line--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
okay,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
that
you
were
talking
about
that
you
could
not
arbitrate
outside
the
state,
and
certainly
a
rule
such
as
that--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--would
cause
those
problems.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
mm
hmm.
well,
again,
i--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--that's
not
the
statute
here.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
right.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
i
think
that
that's--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
no,
i
would
not,
and
indeed,
just
to
follow
up
on
that
point,
it
has
been
argued
by
the
respondents
that
this
is
just
a
notice
statute.
this
doesn't
affect
the
enforceability
of
these
clauses.
but
that
argument
is
simply
not
so.
this
law,
which
is
labeled
a
notice
law,
says
that
arbitration
clauses
containing
agreement
without
notice
are
not
enforceable,
whereas
the
other
terms
in
the
same
agreement,
without
notice,
are
enforceable,
so
this
statute,
which
is
nominally
denominated
in
a
notice
statute
does,
in
fact,
go
to
the
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
clause.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
there
are
a
few
isolated
examples.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
pardon?
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
actually,
i'm
not
sure
that
any
actually
requires
an
underline
on
the
first
page.
there
are...
as
you
might
imagine,
the
ucc,
for
example,
says
that
a
disclaimer
of
implied
warranties
has
to
be
"conspicuous".
that's
a
heightened
notice
statute.
i
believe
the
respondents
make
reference
to
retail
instalment
contracts
requiring
certain
disclosures.
i
don't
believe
they're
underlined
in
capital
letters.
but
basically,
we're
talking
about
not
the
law
generally
in
montana.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
it
is
certainly
just
a
handful.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
it
is
certainly
just
a
handful,
but
i
would
suggest
that
even
if
it
were
5
or
10,
and
i
don't
believe
it
is,
but
let's
say
it
was
even
5
or
10,
we're
not
talking
about
a
coherent
body
of
general
law
applicable
generally,
we're
talking
about
things
that
are
singled
out,
and
why...
and
they're
singling
out
arbitration
in
this
statute
in
the
same
way
in
which
they're
singling
out
other
things
and
not
applying
the
law
generally,
because
the
law
generally
says
that
these
clauses,
even
if
it's
in
an
adhesion
contract,
even
if
there's
unequal
bargaining
power,
if
the
signature's
on
it,
these
clauses
are...
everything
else
in
that
contract
is
presumptively
valid.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
okay,
but
when
you're--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--if
that
were
the
general
principle
announced,
then
you'd
go
to
the
second
prong
of
our
test,
which
is,
is
it's
application
in
that
particular
circumstance,
does
it
turn
on
the
fact
that
it's
arbitration,
and
the
answer
is
no.
it
turns
on
the
fact
that
there's
no
acceptance.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
yes...
i
would
say
again,
does
it
go
back
to
our...
the
two
tests
that
this
court
has
identified?
if
the
list
is
long,
maybe
it
then
qualifies
as
a
law
of
general
application,
but
it's...
the
second
part
is,
why
does
it...
why
is
it
being
applied
in
this
circumstance,
and
in
this
case,
as
you
posit,
it's
making
that
list
because
it's
arbitration.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
under
that
assumption,
we'd
still
prevail
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
because
this
law
only
applies
to
arbitration,
one.
secondly,
under
the
general
law
in
montana,
as
reflected
in
the
cases,
all
the
other
terms
are
valid,
and
third,
even
though
they
may
be
able
to
point
to
a
few
instances
in
which
other
things
have
been
singled
out,
as
arbitration
is
being
singled
out
here,
they're
not
talking
about
the
laws
that
apply
to
contracts
generally,
they're
talking
about
a
handful
of
other
things
that
simply
don't
meet
the
test.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
so
even
under
that
construct
it
fails.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
i
know
the
ucc...
i'm
aware
because
of
their
footnote
that
they're
retail
installment
contracts,
but
that's
all
i'm
aware
of.
for
example,
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
principle
in
montana
law
that
waiving
any
constitutional
right
requires
any
special
notice
on
the
first
page.
you
can
waive
a
jury
trial...
you
can
waive
these
things
under
montana
law,
and
nothing
special
is
required,
but
something
is
specially
required
of
arbitration
under
montana
law,
and
it...
and
the
court
explained
why
something
special
was
required,
and
that
was
because
the
court
itself
and
the
legislature
were
concerned
about
citizens
in
montana
agreeing
to
a
procedure
that
that
court
felt
was
devoid
of
all
procedural
protections.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
to
be
honest,
justice
breyer,
we
have
looked
to
see
whether
there
are
special
rules
for
waiving
any
constitutional
rights
in
montana,
and
we
could
not
find
any,
so
its...
rather
than
having
a
list
of
things
that
you
can,
i
haven't
found
any
in
our
review...
in
our
review
of
the
law.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
right.
your
honor,
i
guess
i
should
have
said
at
the
outset,
i
have
the
view
that
i
have
about
your
question,
but
the
answer,
whether
i
accept
your
view
or
don't
accept
your
view,
to
your
question
doesn't
decide
this
case,
because
this
case
doesn't
deal
with
choice
of
forum.
it
doesn't
deal
with
litigation
and
arbitration,
it
only
deals
with
arbitration,
and
it
only
requires
arbitration
to
be
on
the
first
page,
and
it
only
says...
and
it
says
that
only
arbitration
is
not
enforceable
if
it's
not
on
the
first
page,
so
while
we
may--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
it
certainly
is
not
a
question
that
the
answer
for
which
determines
this
case
at
all,
because
of
the
focused
nature
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
that
the
courts...
it's
important,
under
the
savings
clause,
i
believe,
to
interpret
it
and
to
enforce
it
and
to
apply
it
in
the
way
in
which,
the
manner
in
which
this
court
has
done
in
its
cases,
which
is
to
say,
insist,
as
the
language
does,
that
only
laws
or
principles
that
apply
to
contracts
generally
can
be
used
to
revoke
an
arbitration
clause,
and
it's
important
for
really
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that,
if
you
want
to
allow
states
to
add
additional
limitations,
their
own
special
rules
or
processes
for
arbitration
agreements,
it
inevitably
undercuts
the
enforceability
of
arbitration,
and
it
makes
them...
puts
them
on
a
different
footing
than
other
contracts,
so
it
impairs
not
only
the
words...
violates
the
words
as
such,
but
impairs
congress'
intent
that
this
court
has
recognized
to
treat
arbitration
agreements
like
any
other
contract.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
well,
your
honor,
to
be
honest,
we...
i
think
that
volt
is
about
the
oddest
place
to
find
support
for
the
montana
supreme
court.
volt
enforced
the
parties'
choice
of
law.
volt
enforced
the
arbitration
agreement.
in
this
case,
the
montana
supreme
court
refused
to
enforce
the
parties'
choice
of
law
and
refused
to
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement.
volt
really
was
no
different--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--but
it
didn't
say--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--well--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--well,
but
you're
assuming,
i
think,
in
the
question
that
the
parties
intended
something
different,
and
that's
what
volt
is
all
about.
in
fact,
the
parties
intended
that
that
was
the
result.
it
was...
volt...
i
mean,
really
volt
is
no
different
than
if
the
parties
had
in
their
arbitration
agreement
spelled
out
and
said,
when
there
is
litigation
pending
with
someone
else,
this
is
how
we'll
handle
it,
and
the
court
in
volt
said
that
the...
it
took
the
california
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
the
contract
as
the
effective
equivalent
to
what
i've
just
posed
and
said,
well,
the
faa
is
about
enforcing
parties'
choices,
and
we
need
to
enforce
those
choices,
but
that's
not
the
situation
here.
and
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
parties
have
said,
connecticut
law
governs,
and
we
want
to
arbitrate,
and
the
court
wiped
away
the
connecticut
choice
of
law
and
then
applied
the
montana
statute
to
eliminate
the
parties
choice.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
i
don't
think
the
result...
in
the
ordinary
case
the
result
wouldn't
be
different,
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
certainly--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--well,
under
volt,
then,
you're
trying
to
determine
the
intent
of
the
parties.
however,
this
court
this
last
term
in
the
mastrobuono
case
said...
recognized
it's
a
cardinal
principle
of
statutory
interpretation
that
two
clauses
shouldn't
be
seen
to
intrude
on
one
another.
and
one
would
ask
the
question
then
if
the
court
finds
that
the
choice
of
law
clause
is
meant
to
actually
render
completely
invalid
another
clause
in
the
contract,
are
they
applying
principles
of
contract
construction
in
an
evenhanded
manner,
or
are
they
applying
them
in
a
manner
that's
skewed
against
arbitration?
and
in
perry
the
court
said,
in
construing
an
arbitration
clause,
the
court
must
do
so
the
same
way
it
would
a
nonarbitration
clause,
and
so
if,
in
fact,
the
court
were
overriding
one
clause
of
the
agreement
with
another
clause
of
the
agreement
and
doing
so
because
arbitration
was
involved
as
opposed
to
some
other
term,
then
that
would
run
afoul
of
the
faa
in
the
same
circumstance,
even
when
they
chose
montana
law
in
that
circumstance.
and
you
wouldn't
ordinarily
expect
that
the
parties
in
one
clause
would
say,
we'll
arbitrate,
and
in
another
clause
say,
no,
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
arbitrate.
but
i
must
say,
as
the
amicus
brief
points
out,
that
is
what
courts
have
been
doing
with
volt,
contrary,
i
think,
to
the
intent
of
volt,
is
that
they
have
been
using
a
choice
of
law
clause
to
say,
well
then,
if
you've
chosen
montana
law,
we'll
just
throw
out
the
entire
arbitration
agreement.
that's
not
what
happened
in
volt.
i
don't
think
that's
what
volt
stands
for.
it
certainly
isn't
what
the
court
explained
it
stood
for
in
mastrobuono,
but
yet
that
has
been
happening
in
courts
below.
of
course,
here
again,
the
parties
chose
connecticut
law,
and
under
connecticut
law
this
arbitration
agreement
is
fully
enforceable
and
fully
valid,
and
the
court
then
used
the
notice
statute
to
void
the
parties'
choice
of
law,
the
same
notice
statute
it
used
to
void
the
parties'
choice
of
arbitration.
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
well,
let
me
say
two
things.
first,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
this
statute
isn't
limited
to
forum
contracts
or
adhesion
contracts
or
anything
else.
going
to
your
hypothetical,
i
believe
the
answer
is
no,
if
you
are
saying
holding
the
fact
of
arbitration
unconscionable.
if
you're
striking
down
the
entire
contract,
that
would
be
acceptable
under
the
construct
that
i've
proposed,
because
then
you
would
be
fairly
assured
that
what's
happening
is
a
principle
of
general
application,
not
something
that
is
targeted
to
arbitration,
so
striking
down
the
entire--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
oh,
no,
i--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--no,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--and
let
me
make
myself
clear.
if
they're
striking
down
the
entire
contract
because
there
happens
to
be
an
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract,
that
would
be
invalid
under
volt.
what
i'm
saying
is,
the
court
might
decide
that
all
of
the
terms
of
this
forum
contract
fell--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--because
they're
unconscionable,
wholly
apart
from
whether
it
has
an
arbitration
clause.
for
example,
that--
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
--fraud
in
the
inducement,
for
example.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
or
if
the
arbitration
clause
got
in
there
because
of
fraud
in
the
inducement,
in
that
case...
in
that
case,
there
would
be
general
principle,
fraud
in
the
inducement,
and
it
would
be
determined
not
because
the
subject
matter
is
arbitration,
but
because
there
was
a
fraud
that
went
on
about
a
material
term,
so
it
would
meet
both
of
our
tests
in
that
regard.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
make
two
points
in
my
rebuttal,
if
i
may,
just
so
that
i'm
clear
about
what
our
position
is.
the
first
is
this,
and
it
was
the
second
point
that
i
made
in
my
opening.
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
statute
merely
codifies
some
general
principle
of
expectedness,
which
i
don't
think
it
does,
but
assuming
for
a
moment
that
it
does,
as
ms.
sikes
has
said,
it
still
falls
under
the
faa,
so
it
would
not
be
possible
on
remand
for
the
montana
supreme
court
to
decide
we're
now
going
to
apply
a
general
principle.
the
general
principle
is
adhesion.
we're
not
going
to
call
it
a
statute,
we're
going
to
call
it
a
general
principle,
and
we're
going
to
find
that
this
is
unexpected
because
montana
has
outlawed
arbitration
for
100
years,
and
therefore
no
one
in
montana
would
expect
such
a
clause,
and
this
court
dealt
with
precisely
that
issue
in
perry.
in
footnote
9
in
perry
the
court
said,
you
cannot
have
a
statute
that
singles
out
arbitration,
but
it
didn't
stop
there.
it
went
on
and
said,
but
there's
one
thing
more.
if
you're
applying
a
state
law
principle
of
general
applicability,
and
in
that
case
it
was
the
law
of
unconscionability,
one
can...
a
state
cannot
decide
that
a
principle
is
violated
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
arbitration
is
involved
because
after
all,
if
that's
what
could
be
done,
then
the
courts
could
do
that
which
this
court
has
said
the
legislatures
may
not
do.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
they're
just
attacking...
you're
absolutely
right,
justice
stevens,
and
let
me
say
one
other
thing.
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
this
statute,
ms.
sikes
says
it's
easy
to
comply
with.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
test
that
this
court
has
announced
is
not
whether
it's
easy
to
comply
with,
but
you
have
looked
at
what
is
required
of
other
terms
in
the
contract.
and
looked
at
from
that
point
of
view,
which
is
the
point
of
view
that
the
faa
requires,
other
terms
in
this
particular
contract
don't
have
to
be
in
underlined
capital
letters,
it's
only
the
arbitration
clause
that
must
be,
and
so
the
fact
that
we
might
be
able
to
comply
for
this
one
clause
doesn't
satisfy
the
test.
the
lens
that
this
court
has
to
look
through
is
the
lens
as
to
how
other
clauses
are
treated.
i
would
also
say,
incidentally,
that
the
obstacles
to
complying
with
these
state
laws
are
great,
and
to
follow
up
on
justice
ginsburg
supposition,
it's
not
a
supposition.
missouri
requires
the
notice
to
be
right
above
the
signature.
montana
says
it's
on
the
first
page.
texas
says
it
has
to
be
initialed
by
a
lawyer.
iowa
says
it
has
to
be
signed
by
a
party.
california
says
its
10-point
type,
and
new
york
says
its
12-point
type.
it's
impossible
to
comply
with
all
those
things,
and
the
nationwide
uniformity
that
congress
sought
to
achieve
with
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
destroyed
by
allowing
states
to
do
this.
one
final
note
is
this.
this
court
will
read
the
chor
decision.
the
chor
decision,
one
can
read
it
from
the
front
end
to
the
back
end,
and
the
majority
doesn't
even
mention
the
notice
statute,
so
the
supposition
that
my
opponent
supposes
that
this
law,
technical
noncompliance
doesn't
make
sense.
mr.
mark
r.
kravitz
thank
you.
