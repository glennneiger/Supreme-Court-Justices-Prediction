justice
scalia
well,
the
problem
you're
confronting
is--
justice
scalia
--that
as
far
as
its
generality
is
concerned--
justice
scalia
--that
is
no
different
from
a
provision
that
says
choice
of
forum
provisions
are
invalid.
justice
scalia
as
far
as
its
generality
is
concerned,
the
one
is
the
same
as
the
other.
justice
scalia
and
you
would
certainly
not
assert
that
the
latter
is
okay
under
the
faa,
would
you?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
scalia
you
say
if
you
have
an
arbitration
clause
the
state
can
invalidate
the
whole
contract
because
the
arbitration--
justice
scalia
--clause
is
unconscionable?
justice
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
scalia
was
this
done
simultaneously
with
the--
justice
scalia
--you
want
us
to
look
at
montana
law
as
a
whole,
and
not
at
the
statutory
law
separately
from
the
judge
made
law,
and
you're
saying--
justice
scalia
--if
you
look
at
the
whole
ball
of
wax,
this
is
just
one
piece
of
a
general
rule
requiring
notice
of
surprising
provisions.
justice
scalia
well
then,
our
invalidation
of
it
would
make
no
difference,
would
it?
[laughter]
ms.
sikes,
suppose
we
had
a
case
of,
instead
of
arbitration,
there
was
an
equipment...
there
were
some...
montana,
some
farmers...
i
know
michigan
does.
that's
where
this
case
came
from.
there's
a
rental
equipment
thing
that
they
sign
with
some
company
in
new
york,
and
they
get
into
a
big
dispute,
and
then
they
find
out
this
contract
says
they've
consented
to
be
sued
in
the
state
courts
in
new
york.
under
your
view
of
what
the
montana
law
is,
would
that
be...
fall
under
this
generally
unexpected,
so
it
would
be
no
good?
justice
scalia
that's
remarkable,
given
the
terms
of
the
statute,
that
unless
such
notice
is
displayed,
the
contract
may
not
be
subject
to
arbitration.
the
court
just
says,
well,
that's
what
it
says,
but
we
don't--
justice
scalia
--that's
a
little
harsh,
and
we're
not
going
to
do
that.
justice
scalia
they're
different
out
there
in
montana,
i
guess.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
--those
are
surely
not
cases
which
say
that
the
provision
in
question
must
be
typed
in
underlined
capital
letters
on
the
first
page
of
the
contract.
justice
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
other
ways
of
making
it
prominent.
justice
scalia
like
if
you
wave
it
in
the
face
of
a
plaintiff--
justice
scalia
--or
do
all
sorts
of
things.
it
would
not
be
this
statute--
justice
scalia
--that
is
being
applied.
justice
scalia
are
you
going
to
advise
the
montana
supreme
court
to
go
ahead
and
strike
it
down
under
a
common
law
rule?
do
you
think
that
would
be
good
legal
advice?
i
mean,
you
say
they
may.
justice
scalia
are
you
sure
they
may?
should
they
be
sure
that
they
may?
justice
scalia
they
can
decree
that
arbitration
agreements
are
unexpected.
