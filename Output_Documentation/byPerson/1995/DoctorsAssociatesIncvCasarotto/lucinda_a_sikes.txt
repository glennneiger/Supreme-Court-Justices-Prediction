ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
montana
notice
statute,
a
statute
which
is
aimed
at
ensuring
that
parties
know
that
they're
signing
a
contract
that
includes
an
arbitration
provision,
is
preempted
by
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
montana
notice
requirement
is
different
from
all
the
state
requirements
that
this
court
has
preempted
in
the
past
because
its
function
is
not
to
prevent
arbitration
but
to
help
ensure
that
arbitration
is
consensual.
the
statutes
preempted
in
southland,
in
perry,
and
in
terminex
prevented
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements
so
that
there
was
nothing
a
person
who
wanted
to
enforce
arbitration
could
do
to
make
sure
that
it
would
be
enforced.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
it's
in
the
total
control
of
the
person
drafting
the
agreement
to
make
sure
that
the
arbitration
provision
will
be
enforced.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
i
don't
think
that's
what
montana
is
doing.
let
me
explain
why
it
falls
within
the
savings
clause
of
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
suppose
for
a
moment
that
montana
had
not
adopted
the
statutory
notice
requirement,
but
we
had
similar
facts,
so
that
the
plaintiff
had
tried
to
sue...
had
filed
a
suit
in
court,
the
defendant
had
sought
to
stay
litigation
in
order
to
compel
arbitration,
then
the
plaintiff
could
have
gone
into
court
and
said
that
the
arbitration
was
invalid
under
general
contract
principles
that
unexpected
clauses
in
contracts
need
to
be
conspicuous.
and
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
that
would
have
been
prevented
by
the
federal
arbitration
act,
because
what
the
court
would
be
doing
in
that
case
is
applying
a
general
contract
principle
of
unexpected...
of
reasonable
expectations
doctrine
to
the
arbitration
provision
and
invalidating
it,
and
that
that's
simply
what
the
montana
court
is
doing--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--the
montana
legislature
did
in
enacting
this
statute.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
well,
i
think
what
the
montana...
the
montana
court
has
adopted
the
reasonable
expectations
doctrine,
and
they've
spelled
out
how
they
apply
the
doctrine
in
two
cases
involving
arbitration,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
that
doctrine,
it
could
have
been
applied
in
this
case.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
no,
it
wasn't
applied
in
this
case.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
right,
but
my
argument
is,
is
that
if
it
would
have
been
okay
for
the
montana
court
to
have
invalidated
it
under
those
general
contract
principles,
it
should
also
be
okay
for
the
montana
legislature
to
do
the
same
thing.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
the
notice
provision,
the
notice
requirement
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
that...
in
1985,
when
montana
was
changing
their
entire
law,
and
for
the
100
years
previously
it
had
been
montana...
in
montana's
statute
that
arbitration
agreements
weren't
going
to
be
enforced,
so
i
think
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
montana
legislature
to
assume
that
it
would
be...
it
wasn't
a
background
knowledge
that
people
had
in
montana,
because--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--but
the
statute
itself
does
not
discourage
arbitration,
and
it
doesn't
prevent
the
enforcement
of
arbitration.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
well,
that--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--that's
right,
and
that
provision
has
to
mean
something,
and
if
there
is
a
doctrine
that
says
that...
the
unexpected
terms
and
standardized
form
contract
doctrine
is
not
only
applied
to
arbitration
provisions,
it's
applied
to
terms
and
standardized
form
contracts
that
the
person
signing
the
agreement
might
not
expect.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
no.
no,
it
did
not,
but
what
the
montana
legislature
was
doing
in
enacting
the
notice
requirement
in
statute
was
essentially
the
same
thing.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
no,
that's
not
true.
there
are
some
other
examples--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--it
does
single
out
arbitration,
but
it's...
but
the
montana...
under
montana
law,
other
provisions
in
a
contract
could
be
invalidated
if
they
weren't
conspicuous
under
this
general
common
law
that's
also
in
montana,
and
what
the
legislature
is
doing
is
simply
creating
a
bright
line
rule
that
actually
helps
people
who
are
drafting
agreements
to
know,
okay,
if
i'm
going
to
put
an
arbitration
provision
in,
it
needs
to
be
conspicuous,
and
this
is
how
i
need
to
make
sure
it's
going
to
be
conspicuous.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
well,
you
have
to
look
at
the
reason
that
the
legislature
was
doing
it.
it
wasn't
saying,
okay,
what
are
the
unexpected
provisions
out
there?
it
was
done
in
a
context
of
considering
arbitration,
and
i
don't
think
a
legislature
has
to
do
everything
in
order
to
do
anything.
it
was
identifying--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--yes,
exactly.
in
1985,
as
a
result
of
southland,
for
the
first
time
in
montana
arbitration
agreements
became
enforceable,
and
at
that
same
time,
the
montana
legislature
required
there
to
be
a
notice
given
so
that
people
knew
that
they
were
now
signing
a
contract
that
included
an
arbitration
provision.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
exactly.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
exactly.
that's
exactly--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--the
other
members
of
the
class
in
statute
are
terms
and
retail...
retail
installment
contracts,
part
of
the
ucc
requirements
that
petitioner
was
talking
about.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
but
then
also
in
common
law
montana
has
invalidated
certain
provisions
in
insurance
contracts,
and
also,
montana
doesn't
have
a
huge
body
of
case
law.
they
do
look
to
california,
because
they
adopted
their
code
from
california,
so
they
also
looked
to
the
california
common
law,
where
there's
been
several
other
types
of
provisions--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--yes.
yes.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
right.
it--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--yes.
there's
not
a
comprehensive
list.
there's
some
cases.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
there
aren't
very
many
cases
in
montana.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
well,
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
terms
of
arbitration
agreements,
they...
before
1985
they
were
invalidated
for
a
whole
lot
of
other
reasons,
and
so
you'd
only
be
looking
at
a
short
period
of
time,
anyway.
i
wanted
to
go
back
to--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--i
think
that
the
rationale
behind
what
the
montana
legislature
was
doing
in
that
is
based
on
the
understanding
that
people
don't
necessarily
read
form
contracts
carefully,
and
so--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--well,
i
think
that
the
terms
that
need...
in
the
statute
have
to
do
with
the
high
interest
rates
that
are
in
retail
installment
contracts,
and
so
it
wouldn't
be
within
the
reasonable
expectations
of
a
person
signing
a
retail
installment
contract
that
there
were
going
to
be
such
high
interest
rates
applied--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--it's
not
that
the
term
is
disfavored,
because
if
that
were
the
case...
well,
obviously--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--under
the
federal
law
they
couldn't
do
that.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
exactly.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
exactly.
i
think
that's
right,
and
i
think
it's
important
also
to
note
that
the
way
that
that
statute's
been
applied
in
montana
is
that
if...
that
shows
that
it's
really
a
notice
requirement
and
nothing
more
is
the
chor
case,
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
in
that
case,
ms.
chor
signed
a
contract
that
included
an
arbitration
provision.
she
said
that
she
understood
at
the
time
she
signed
the
contract
that
the
arbitration,
that
her...
any
disputes
under
the
contract
would
have
to
be
arbitrated,
and
even
though
the
notice
requirement
wasn't
on
the
front
page
of
that
contract,
the
montana
supreme
court
went
ahead
and
compelled
arbitration.
i
think
that
shows
that
in
montana
it
really
is
an
informed
consent
provision.
if
the
parties
consent
to
arbitrate,
then
the
court
is
going
to
enforce
it.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
it
just
kind
of
ignores
it,
actually.
it
doesn't
really
explain
it.
it
recognizes
that
the
statute
exists,
but
then...
then--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--well,
it
actually
would
do
more
than
that,
because
montana
has
a
statute...
i
wanted
to
point
this
out
to
justice
breyer,
too,
that
for
bids,
legal
contracts
from
restraining
legal...
from
putting
any
restraints
on
legal
proceedings,
so
forum
selection
clauses
that
are
outside
the
state
in
montana
are
void
as
a
matter
of
the
statute,
as
would
jury
trial,
so
there's
no
need
to
require
notice
of
those
waiver
type
provisions,
because
you
just
can't
waive
your
legal
rights,
except
for
arbitration.
that
statute
then,
the--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--right.
you
can't
consent
to
forum
selection
clauses
that
are
outside
of
the
state
in
montana.
you
can't--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--well,
the
statute...
it
says
restraints
upon
legal
proceedings
are
void,
so
any...
it's
been
used
to...
every
stipulation
or
condition
in
a
contract
by
which
any
party
thereto
is
restricted
from
enforcing
his
rights
under
the
contract
by
the
usual
proceedings
in
the
ordinary
tribunals,
or
which
limits
the
time
within
which
he
may
thus
enforce
his
rights,
is
void,
and
it's
been
used...
it
now
has
an
exception,
so
it
doesn't
invalidate
arbitration
agreements.
that
was
what...
it
was
amended
in
1985.
before
1985,
it
was
used
to
apply
to
arbitration
provisions,
but
since
then,
it
also
has
been
applied
for
forum
selection
clauses,
for
statute
of
limitations--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--well,
in
that
case--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--oh,
right.
right.
absolutely.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
petitioner's
basic
argument
is
is
that
whenever
a
court
or
legislature
applies
a
general
contract
principle
in
a
case
involving
an
arbitration
clause,
that
violates
the
federal
arbitration
act
because
it
singles
out
an
arbitration...
because
by
singling
out
the
arbitration
clause
it
shows
hostility
toward
arbitration.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
okay.
no--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--i
think
that's
right,
and
i...
but
my
point
is
is
that
congress
said
that
arbitration
agreements
can
be
invalidated
upon
grounds
that
exist
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract,
and
that
the
savings
clause
has
to
mean
something,
and
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
a
state
can't
invalidate
an
unexpected
clause
in
a
standardized
form
contract
and
use
that
general
principles
and
apply
it
specifically
to
arbitration
clauses,
then
i
don't
think
section
2
means
anything.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
they've
invalidated
them.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
but
what
the
montana...
the
doctrine
of
how
you
determine
whether
or
not
something
is
within
the
reasonable
expectations
of
someone
signing
the
contract
also
has
to
go
to
whether
it's
conspicuous
or
not.
the
common
law
has
developed
that
way,
so
if
it's
on
the
front
page
of
a
contract
you
can't
argue
any
more
that
you
didn't
expect
to
see
it
because
it's
there,
it's
in
capital
letters,
and
you
see
it,
so
you
can
no
longer
say,
well,
i
didn't
know
what
i
was
signing.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
yes.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
yes.
you
make
sure
it's
conspicuous.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
well,
the
people
would
be
looking
for
those,
and
the
common
law
doesn't
say
it
has
to
be
on
the
front
page,
but...
which
is
why
i
think
the
statute
actually
benefits
parties,
because
it
sets
out
what
the
person
drafting
the
agreement
has
to
do
in
order
to
make
sure
that
their
provision
is
conspicuous
enough.
so
it
sets
out
a
bright
line
rule.
once
it's
on
the
front
page,
they
don't
have
to
worry.
they
know
it's
going
to
be
enforced
in
montana.
montana
has,
since
southland,
time
after
time,
enforced
arbitration
agreements.
it's
not
a
state
that's
refusing
to
enforce
arbitration
agreements.
they've
only
refused
twice,
once
in
this
case
and
the
other
one,
which
was
based
on
volt,
and
all
that
the...
the
statute
doesn't
create
any
burden,
any
significant
burden
on
a
business
to
comply
with
it.
it
simply
requires
them
to
look
in
the
statute,
see
what's
required,
put
it
on
the--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--well,
that's
why
i
think
that
the
chor
case
is
important,
because
it
shows
that
in
montana
technical
noncompliance
isn't
going
to
mean
that
the
arbitration
provision
is
going
to
be
thrown
out,
so
that
if...
if,
in
montana,
you
had
a...
if
you
made
sure
that
the
arbitration
provision
was
conspicuous
in
some
other
way,
the
evidence
from
chor
would
be
that
the
montana
supreme
court
would
go
ahead
and
enforce
it,
and
i'd
also
just
like
to
say
that...
i
mean--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--right.
she
did
know
about
it.
she
did--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--i
think
that
the...
that
businesses
who
transact
in
interstate
commerce...
doctor's
associates
has
10,000
franchisees
across
the
country,
and
for
each
of...
they
have
to
comply
with
all
sorts
of
different
state
laws
as
it
is,
so
this
is
not
a
significant
burden
on
them.
for
example,
12
states
have
franchise--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--yes.
i
think--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--i--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--i
think
that
there's
evidence,
given
the
chor
case,
that
the
montana
court,
if
the
provision
was
conspicuous,
wouldn't
hold
the
party
to
such
an
exacting
requirement
as
notice,
because
if
it
had
been
conspicuous
in
some
other
way,
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
of
providing
informed
consent,
would
have
been
given.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
but
the--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--well,
i
wish--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--i
think
there's
two...
there's
two
points
to
your
question.
first,
i'm
not
sure
that,
given
the
chor
case,
the
montana
court
wouldn't
have
gone
ahead
and
enforced
an
arbitration
agreement
anyway,
but
even
if
they
were...
looked
at
the
montana
notice
statute
and
said,
it's
not
the
way
we
require,
we're
going
to
invalidate
the
arbitration
provision.
it's
not
a
tremendous
burden
on
an
interstate...
on
a
business
transacting
business
across
the
country
to
make
sure
that
they
comply
with
the
different
requirements
of
each
state.
as
i
was
saying,
there's
12
states
that
have
these
franchise
registration
and
disclosure
requirements.
franchisers
have
to
know
what
those
are,
and
they
have
to
comply
with
them.
this
is
just
a
insignificant
burden
compared
to
all
the
other
state
laws
that
someone
has
to
comply
with.
all
it
does
is,
it
requires...
it's
just
to
ensure
that
a
person
signing
a
contract
knows
that
it
includes
an
arbitration
provision.
it
doesn't
discourage
arbitration
in
any
way,
and
it
is
easy
for
someone
drafting
the
agreement
to
comply
with
it.
it's
not
a
difficult
process
at
all.
i
also
just
want
to--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--yes.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
i
don't
know.
that's
a...
would
be
a
matter
of...
i
don't
think
that
that's
specific
to
this
particular
situation.
that
would
be
in
any
case
where
there
was...
parties
were
trying
to
proceed
in
montana
and
connecticut
thought
that
they
had
more
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
i
don't...
that
isn't
specific
to
whether
arbitration
is
involved.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
right,
and
so...
well,
i...
the...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
exactly
what
your
question
is.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
but
the
federal
arbitration
act
did
leave
for
the
states
the
ability
to
invalidate
arbitration
agreements
under
general
grounds
that
would
apply
to
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
well,
i...
if
you
can't
say
that,
then
i
don't
see
that
the
savings
clause
in
section
2
means
anything,
because
by
singling...
you'd
always
be
singling
out
an
arbitration
provision
in
any
kind
of
case
where
you
were
looking
at
the
validity
of
the
making
of
that
agreement.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
my
time
is
limited.
what--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--yes.
yes.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
right.
i
think...
and
if
that
is
true
that
that's
okay,
which
i
think
it
has
to
be
under
the
savings
clause,
then
what
the
montana
legislature
did
should
also
be
okay,
because
it
was
essentially
doing
the
same
thing.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
yes.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
yes,
and
so
what
they
were
doing
was
simply
creating
this
bright
line
rule
that
actually
benefits
arbitration
because
it
gives
people
that
rule
that
they
know
they
have
to
comply
with.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
let
me--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--in
case
i
don't,
there's
transamerica
v.
royale,
which
is
the
case
where
the
montana
court
adopted
the
reasonable
expectations
doctrine.
that's
at
656
p.
2d
820
at
824.
then
it's
discussed
again
in
passage
and
chor,
which
are
both
cited
in
my
brief,
state
farm
v.
estate
of
braun,
which
is
793
p.
2d
253.
it's
discussed
again
in
wellcome,
with
two
l's,
v.
home
insurance
company,
849
p.
2d
190.
and
i
think
it's
also
important,
though,
to--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--no.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
right.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
that's--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--no,
that's--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--that's
correct.
that's
correct,
but
what
the
statute
does
is,
it
tells
the
party
drafting
the
agreement
how
to
be
sure
that
it's
going
to
meet
the
requirements
that--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--right.
it
encourages...
it
makes
sure
that,
unlike,
as
i
said,
all
the
other
statutes
that
this
court
has
preempted,
this
one
is
easy
to
comply
with.
in
all
the
other
cases,
there
was
nothing
someone
who
wanted
to
arbitrate
could
do
to
ensure
that
their
arbitration
agreement
would
be
enforced.
in
this
case,
all
they
have
to
do
is
comply
with
this
requirement,
which
is
an
insignificant
burden.
they
just
need
to
put
it
on
the
front
page.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
well--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--i
think
they
can,
because
if--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--not
as
a
general...
i...
they
would
be
looking
to
the--
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
--no.
no,
i
wouldn't.
i'd
better
sit
down.
ms.
lucinda
a.
sikes
thank
you.
mr.
kravitz,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
