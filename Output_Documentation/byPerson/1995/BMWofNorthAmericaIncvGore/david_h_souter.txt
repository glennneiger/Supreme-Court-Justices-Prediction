mr.
frey--
--well,
mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question
before
you
get
into
that?
you
have
argued,
as
i
recall,
that
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
error
was
that
alabama
was
allowing
the
jury
to
punish
for
conduct
which
was
lawful
in
the
states
in
which
it
took
place
and
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
premised
on
your
statement
that
when
bmw
adopted
its
3
percent
cost
policy
it
was
complying
with
the
most
stringent
of
out
of
state
laws.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
just
tell
you
what
my
question
is,
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--my
question
is,
in
those
states
in
which...
which
had
adopted
this
3
percent
rule,
is
it
also
the
case,
as
counsel
on
the
other
side
have
claimed,
that
the
common
law
fraud
action
was
preserved
and
any
plaintiff
in
any
of
those
other
states
could
still
have
brought
a
common
law
fraud
action
based
upon
repairs,
undisclosed
repairs,
even
though
they
did
not
amount
to
3
percent
of
the
cost?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
understand
the
court's
reasoning
to
be
that
had
it
not
exceeded
it
would
have
been
no
fraud
cause
of
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there...
i
take
it
that
is
the
extent
of
the
out
of
state
discussion
of
the
subject.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not...
why
is
it
kafkaesque?
i
mean,
can't
a
state
simply
say,
look,
we're
not
going
to
provide
the
administrative
machinery
of
the
state
to
go
after
these
dealers
unless
the
dereliction
reaches
a
certain
point,
but
if
any
individual
who
has
been
defrauded
wants
to
go
after
them
for
the
amount
of
his
loss,
the
individual
is
free
to
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be
hard
to
say,
but
do
you...
are
you
saying
or
would
you
argue
that
the
courts
of
alabama
should
have
instructed
the
jury
that
so
long
as
the
damage
did
not
reach
this
3
percent
threshold
that
as
a
matter
of
law
it
could
not
be
considered
as--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
aren't
you
then
making
a
jury
argument
to
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
a
question
which
is
an
alternative,
or
rests
on
the
alternative
of
justice
ginsburg's
premise.
let's
assume
that
they
did
indeed...
that
whatever
is
left
on
that
verdict
rests
upon
a
consideration
of
out
of
state
conduct.
why
isn't
the
answer
to
that
that
in
fact
alabama
was
not
punishing
anything
other
than
alabama
conduct?
on
the
analogy
with
the
argument
which
is
common
in
the
enhanced
damage
area
in
criminal
law,
we
say,
well,
the
enhanced
penalty
is
not
a
further
punishment
for
prior
crimes
which
may
be
considered,
and
why
do
we
not
look
at
the
alabama
rule
as
simply
saying
alabama
says
if
you've
done
it
in
other
states,
you
better
watch
it
here,
because
we're
going
to
sock
you
hard
as
a
result
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
it
punished,
or
was
it
used
as
a
measure
for
enhancement
in
punishing
the
alabama--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
conversely
you're
saying
what
is
left
is
still
a
punishment
for
extraterritorial
conduct
and
that's
wrong,
whether
it's
2
million
or
2.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
there
wouldn't
be
any
extraterritorial
punishment.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
so
long
as
there's
some
extraterritorial
punishment--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
was
going
to
say,
in
your
brief
you
make
the
claim
that
in
your...
of
course,
you
could
still
have
common
law
fraud
in
alabama.
do
i
remember
correctly
that
you
also
made
the
statement
that
there
is
no...
there
is
at
least
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
couldn't
have
been
a
common
law
fraud
action
in
any
of
the
other
states
with
the
limits?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
implicitly
you're
relying,
i
guess,
so
far
as
analogies
go,
on
the
fact
that
in
the
criminal
enhancement
field
we...
at
least
there
is
no
authority
to
the
effect
that
it
would
be
proper
for
a
state
to
say,
we
will
set
our
punishment
for
conduct
in
this
state
by
multiplying
a...
you
know,
a
particular
term
of
years
for
every
similar
act
that
took
place
elsewhere.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
does
it
like
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
harder...
it's
not
a
kind
of
a
multiplier
punishment.
