mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
begin
by
rehearsing
a
little
bit
more
the
procedural
posture
in
which
this
case
got
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
because
it
bears
heavily
on
this
first
question
that's
presented
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
as
mr.
frey
explained,
before
the
trial,
bmw
moved
to
bar
the
admission
of
these...
the
evidence
of
out
of
state
sales,
and
the
judge
denied
that
motion,
and
bmw
now
concedes
that
that
denial
was
correct,
the
evidence
was
in
fact
admissible.
the
parties
went
to
trial.
they
were
admitted,
and
then
in
closing
argument
counsel
made
the
unfortunate
statement
which
the
alabama
supreme
court
thought
created
an
improper
issue
for
the
jury.
bmw
did
not,
as
justice
ginsburg
observed...
bmw
did
not
object
to
that.
if
it
had
objected
to
that,
under
alabama
law,
as
the
supreme
court
has
told
us
it
is
in
alabama,
the
judge
either
would
have
had
to
give
a
corrective
instruction
to
the
jury
which
said,
look
only
at
alabama
sales,
or,
if
the
judge
had
refused
to
give
that
correction,
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
new
trial,
not
to
a
remittitur.
under
alabama
law,
if
there
is
a
judicial
error
that
affected
the
outcome,
alabama
will
not
remit,
it
will
give
the
defendant
a
new
trial.
now,
because
bmw
didn't--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
you
can
do
it
either
then
or
at
the
end,
but
they
do,
your
honor.
i'll
give
you
the
cites
to
two
cases
in
which
alabama
says
that
unless
the
counsel
says
something
that's
uncorrectible,
and
they've
made
it
clear
that's
an
appeal
to
racial
bias,
or
that
kind
of
thing,
unless
it
is
uncorrectible,
the
failure
to
object
to
it
means
that
you
have
waived
the
right
to
a
new
trial
or
to
appeal
from
it.
there's
the
alabama--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
because
the
motion
in
limine
was
only
to
the
admissibility
of
the
documents,
not
to...
it
did
not
address--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
it
didn't--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--okay.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
guess
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
would
give
the
court
reference
to
alabama
power,
342
southern
2d,
at
327,
and
southern
life,
518
southern
2d
at
77,
where
the
court
explains
its
practice
respecting
the
failure
to
object
to
counsel's
statements.
now,
bmw
understood
that
because
it
had
not
objected
it
could
not
move
for
a
new
trial
on
this
ground,
and
it
did
not.
it
moved
for
a
new
trial
on
that
the
judge
erred
in
admitting
the
evidence,
because
there
they
had
gotten
the
ruling
from
the
judge
and
they
were
challenging
it.
but
on
this
issue,
they
realized
that
they
couldn't
move
for
a
new
trial
because
they
hadn't
objected.
they
had
waived
it.
what
they
did
instead
is,
they
were
fortunate
that
alabama
has
a
very
generous
remittitur
practice.
the
defendant
in
any
case
where
punitives
has
been
awarded
can
ask
for
a
post
judgment
hearing,
put
in
any
evidence
that
it
wants,
and
say,
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence,
please
reduce
the
verdict,
and
they
invoked
that,
and
in
this
post
judgment
hearing
for
the
first
time
they
introduced
the
evidence
that
only
14
of
these
983
cars
were
alabama
cars.
they
had...
before
the
jury
they
had
made
no
reference
to
the
location
of
these
cars
at
all.
there
was
no
reference
by
either
party
to
where
these
983
cars
were
sold,
and
the
only
point
that
bmw
made
in
response
to
counsel's
statement
which
the
alabama
supreme
court
was
unhappy
with
was,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
those
983
cars.
they're
just
as
good
as
any
other
car,
so
you
shouldn't
punish
us
for
them.
but
now,
in
the
remittitur
proceeding,
they
did
make
an
issue
of
the
geography.
they
did
put
in
the
fact
that
only
14
of
those
983
cars
were
alabama
cars,
and
they
asked
the
alabama
courts
to
reduce
the
punitive
damage
verdict--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
they
made
the
argument.
it
is
not
a
fact.
they
made
the
argument
that
in
a
lot
of
states
there
are
statutes
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that
they
would
have
been
unlawful?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right,
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
said--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
there's
no
evidence
of
whether
they
are
unlawful
or
not
in
other
states,
so
they
brought
that
out
at
the
remittitur
hearing
as
well.
now,
the
alabama
supreme
court
was
in
this
case
in
a
peculiar
posture.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
that
there
were--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--at
the
time
they
adopted
the
policy,
15
states
had
those
statutes.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
25
states
had
those
statutes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
at--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
alabama
by
the
time
of
trial,
but
after
the
sale
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
the
alabama
statute--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
except
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
construed
that
statute
not
to
preempt
the
common
law
fraud
action.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
that
is,
with
the
possible
exception
of
one
of
those
statutes,
they
don't
contain
safe
harbor
language
in
them.
they
don't
say,
if
you
comply
with
this
statute
that
means
that
you
can't
be
sued
under
the
common
law--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
of
course.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
of
course,
that's
right,
and
your
honor,
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
we
don't
think
you
should
consider
the
sales
out
of
state
at
all
in
determining
the
amount.
that's
relevant
to
the
culpability,
but
not
to
the
amount
of--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
the...
it's...
they
haven't
shown
that
they
complied
with
the
law.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
i...
there's
no
case.
i'm
talking
about--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
they
concede
it's
relevant.
the
alabama
supreme
court--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--the
relevance
is
that
it
goes
to
show
the,
among
other
things
we
have
a--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--pardon?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
it
also
goes
to
show
why
they...
that
it
is
a
nationwide
policy,
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--they
are
reluctant
to
change
it,
that
they
are
making
a
profit
off
of
the--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
your
honor,
at
best--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
doesn't.
it
doesn't
have...
alabama
has
to
be
alabama
regarding--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--in
determining
the
amount
of
punitive
damages.
in
determining
the
quality
and
the
character
of
the
party
before
them
and
how
it
should
be
punished
for
its
alabama
behavior,
just--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
correct,
and
now
i
want
to
come
back
to
where
i
was
on
the
procedural
posture.
if
they
had
objected,
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
they
didn't
object,
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
you're
asking
us
to
give
you
a
remittitur
for
this.
we
agree
with
you,
the
counsel
shouldn't
have
said
that,
and
we
agree
with
you
that
the
likely
thing
the
jury
did
was
to
do
this
arithmetic
computation,
and
therefore
you're
entitled
to
a
remittitur.
now,
the
question...
and
now,
it
said,
we
are
going
to
redetermine
the
amount
of
punitive
damages,
and
the
question
is,
did
that
remove...
we'd
still
have
the
second
question,
which
is,
is
their
own
redetermination
excessive,
but
did
that
remove
the
taint,
as
bmw
calls
it,
of
the
jury's
consideration
of
the
out
of
state
sales?
now,
in
their--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
and
i--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--all
right,
and
that's
exactly
where--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--we
do,
and
i've
advised
mr.
frey
that
we
would,
because
our
brief
didn't,
and
it's
reading
his
reply
brief
that
made
us
realize
the
following
mistake.
the
court
in
this
case
did
not
say
it's
reducing
to
the
maximum.
on
page
21a
of
its
opinion,
in
the
appendix,
21a,
it
said,
we
hold
that
a
constitutionally
reasonable
punitive
damage
award
in
this
case
is
2
million.
now,
those
are
the
words
it
used.
it
didn't
say
maximum,
it
didn't
not
say
maximum.
it's
not
clear
what
they
meant
by
that.
in
their
brief,
mr.
frey
and
bmw
said
that,
well,
look
at
other
alabama
cases
where
the
court
has
said
that
our
practice
is
to
reduce
to
the
maximum
that
would
be
constitutionally
permissible,
and
they
cited
a
case
called
big
b,
and
there
are
other
cases
to
the
same
effect.
now,
we
went
back,
after
reading
their
reply
brief,
and
read
each
of
those
cases
that
has
said
we're
reducing
to
the
maximum.
each
of
them
is
a
case
where
the
trial
was
error
free.
the
only
thing
that
was
being
complained
about
was
that
the
amount
the
jury
brought
in
exceeded
the
maximum
amount
that
could
be
justified
for
punishment
and
deterrence,
what
are
called
in
the
jargon
mere
excessiveness
cases,
and
in
that
context
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
said,
when
the
only
problem
we
have
is
that
the
jury's
verdict
is
higher
than
could
be
justified,
we
reduced
to
the
maximum
that
would
be
justified,
and
the
inference
was
drawn
in
bmw's
brief...
and
as
i
say,
and
i
apologize
for
this,
we
acquiesced
in
it...
that
that
must
be
what
they
did
here
as
well.
but
this
case
is
unique
in
that
it
is
a
case
where
we
don't
have
an
error
free
trial,
but
because
they
didn't
object,
they're
not
entitled
to
the
new
trial
they
would
automatically
be
entitled
to.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
the
adverb
is
there
because
they're
saying
that
what
made
this
one
constitutionally
unreasonable
was
the
consideration
of
out
of
state
conduct.
what
makes
it
constitutionally
reasonable
is
that
we
have
determined
the
award
without
considering
the
out
of
state
conduct.
i
believe
that
that's
the
meaning
of
it.
it's...
i
don't
mean
to
claim
that
i
can
tell
you
with
absolute
certainty
that
alabama
did
not
use
a
maximum
here.
what
i'm
saying
is,
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
because
they
do
in
those
other
cases
they
did
here.
two
things
are
striking.
one
is
that
they
didn't
say...
this
language
is
pretty
standard
in
their
cases,
we
reduce
to
the
maximum
amount,
and
we
don't
find
it
here.
and
the
second
thing
is
that
when
we
realized
this
and
followed
up
on
it
we
found
one
other
alabama
case
where,
because
of
peculiarity
of
posture,
the
court
had
before
it
a
remittitur
where
there
was
error.
the
error
in
that
case
was
found
to
be
genuine
bias
by
the
jury.
that
case
was
the
harmon
case
at
525
southern
2d
411,
and
it
seems
clear
from
the
face
of
that
opinion
that
in
that
case
where
there
was
a
tainted
jury
verdict
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
remit
to
the
maximum
possible
amount
but
to
something
less
than
that,
because
it
said,
since
this
was
a
tainted
award,
the
plaintiff,
if
it
rejects
this
remittitur,
will
not
be
bound
to
this
as
the
maximum
that
it
can
seek,
so
they
plainly
didn't
think
they
were
imposing
the
maximum.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
in
the
case
that
we
cite
in
this
section
of
our
brief,
clemons
v.
mississippi,
this
court
had
a
similar
problem.
it
didn't
know
exactly
what
the
state
court
had
done
as
between
two
alternatives,
one
of
which
would
have
been
constitutionally
okay,
and
the
other
of
which
would
have
been
constitutionally
troublesome,
and
what
the
court
did
in
that
case
is
say,
now,
if
this
is
what
you
did,
court,
it
was
okay,
but
if
this
is
what
you
did,
it
wasn't,
and
we
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion,
and
that
would
certainly
be
an
option.
that
is,
if
the
court
thinks
that
a
maximum
would
have
tainted
the
award
but
that
a
redetermination
would
not,
it
could
say
that.
i
think
it
would
be
dangerous
to
try
to
conclude
from
this
language
that
you
know
which
of
these
choices
the
alabama
supreme--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--certainly,
in
the
absence
of
evidence
that
it's
unlawful
in
those
states,
we
would
agree
that
they--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i
think
due
process
concerns--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--but
i
want
to
be
clear
what
we're
agreeing
to--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--for
conduct
that
didn't...
did
or
did
not
occur
in
alabama?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
you
know,
we
have
a...
there's
a
grossly
excessive
test
under
the
due
process
clause
that
this
court's--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--there
might
be,
your
honor.
i
don't...
you
know,
it's
not
this
case,
but
it
might
or
it
might
not.
i
could
see
a
problem
if
a
state
did
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
the
answer
is
i
would
not
be
sure...
alabama
removed
it
by
saying
you
can't...
alabama
went
further
than
both
we
and
bmw
thinks
the
constitution
requires.
alabama
said
that
we
are
not
allowed
to
consider
the
out
of
state
sales
in
determining
the
amount.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
now,
we
agree
that
alabama--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--there
might
well
be,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
alabama
has
absolutely
foolproof
protections
against
that
happening.
alabama,
uniquely
among
the
states--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--stated
that
way,
i
agree
with
it,
yes.
alabama
at
least
without
a
determination
that
it's
unlawful
in
another
state,
alabama
can't.
the
reason
i'm
putting
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
of
course.
yes,
of
course,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
here's
my--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
i
understand,
but
here's
my
concern.
suppose
this
case
had
not
been
filed
in
alabama
but
because
perhaps
they
couldn't
get
in
personam
jurisdiction,
and
so
it
were
filed
in
new
jersey.
if
the
issue
were
whether
new
jersey,
applying
alabama
law,
would
be
allowed
to
award
punitive
damages
or
not,
that's
an
interesting
question.
ordinarily,
one
state
doesn't
punish
conduct
in
another
state.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
takes
account
of
out
of
state--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--of
course.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
of
course,
and
that's
the
point
i'm
making,
is
that
while
alabama
can't
say,
we
want
to
punish
you
for
what
you
did
in
texas,
alabama
can
say
that
in
determining
the
quality
and
character
of
your
actions
in
alabama--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--exactly...
we
can
look
to
the
conduct
that
you've
engaged
in
in
other
states
just
as
this
court
has
held
that
the
due
process
clause
allows
that
in
sentencing
by
a
state
in
a...
or
by
a
federal
court,
for
that
matter,
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
in
some
sense,
that's
what
a
recidivist
statute
does.
it
doesn't
do
exactly
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--you
know,
the
three
strikes
you're
out
statutes
are
going
to--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--give
a
greatly
increased
punishment
because
of
actions--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
may
be
much
more
than
a
multiplier.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
but
both
due
process
and
double
jeopardy
apply
to
the
criminal
proceedings,
and
to
the
extent
that
courts
are
allowed
to
do
this
in
sentencing
in
a
criminal
case,
it
would
seem
to
follow
a
fortiori
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
i
want
to
be--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
you
know,
i
don't
think
the
court
should
take
too
much
counsel
from
what
i
say
about
this,
because
since
in
this
case
alabama
has
removed
all
these
issues
from
the
consideration--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
right,
absolutely.
that's
why...
and
therefore,
since
i--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--okay.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay,
let
me
address
that,
your
honor,
because...
and
thank
you
for
bringing
me
to
that.
there
are
two
things
i
want
to
say
about
that.
number
1,
the
alabama
court
knew
and
had...
was
entitled
to
find
that
there
were
many,
many,
many
more
than
14
cars
that
had
been
sold
in
alabama.
they
told
us
that
they
did
a
thorough
and
painstaking
review
of
the
record
in
arriving
at
the
award.
now,
i
can't
tell
you
for
sure,
because
they
didn't
tell
us
what
the
elements
were
that
led
them
to
the
2
million,
but
this
record
gives
a
basis
for
believing
that
there
were
hundreds
of
cars
in
alabama
that
were
sold
that
were
repainted.
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
second.
and
then
secondly,
i'll
address
the
other
implications
that
would
flow
even
if
it
were
only
14.
incidentally,
as
to
the
question
of
whether
everybody
can
do
the
same
thing,
the
answer
is
no.
alabama...
remember
that
punitive
damages
are
not
just
to
punish
for
past
acts,
but
to
deter
future
acts.
alabama
had
a
practice
that
was
on
going,
and
so
it
needed
to
have
a
penalty
large
enough
to
deter
the
practice
from
continuing.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
we
said
that...
i
don't
believe--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
yes--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
because--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--if
they
would
not
stop
in
alabama--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
that's
right...
it's
always
true,
when
you
have
to
set
punitive
damages--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
that's
right.
they
didn't
put
this
before
the
jury.
in
the
post
judgment
hearing
they
put
on
testimony
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--immediately
prior
to
this
trial
a
phone
call
was
made
saying,
don't
send
cars
to
alabama.
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
that.
one,
that...
as
that
testimony
developed,
it
became
clear
that
cars
would
continue
to
come
into
alabama,
because
dealers
trade
cars
all
the
time.
they're
all
linked
into
a
computer
network,
and
when
a
customer
wants
a
particular
kind
of
car,
you
trade.
the
testimony
was,
our
dealers
trade
lots
of
cars,
and
this
record
shows
a
lot
of
interstate
trades,
and
the
witness
was
then
asked,
well...
this
was
a
phone
conversation,
this
changed
policy.
it
was
just
a
phone
conversation...
don't
do
it.
the
witness
was
then
asked,
well,
what
change
did
you
make
to
assure
that
these
repainted
cars
wouldn't
then
just
get
traded
back
into
alabama
from
one
dealer
to
another,
and
he
said,
we
did
nothing
about
that.
what's
most
interesting...
so
at
best
what
they
were
saying
was,
okay,
we've
been
caught.
we
promise
from
now
on
we
will
reduce
the
amount
of
fraud
that
we
commit
in
alabama,
because
what
they
weren't
willing
to
say
is,
we
will
disclose,
because
they
couldn't
just
disclose
in
alabama
without
disclosing
nationwide.
there
was
no
way
they...
even
when
they
wanted
to
fix
this
problem,
they
couldn't
fix
it
by
disclosing
it
in
alabama
because,
since
they
knew
cars
came
from
other
states,
they'd
have
to
disclose
in
other
states
as
well,
and
they
didn't
want
to
do
that.
and
so
the
first
argument
we
made,
and
i
want
to
defend
the
court
here
today
on
the
ground
it
itself
used,
which
is,
it
didn't
consider
the
out
of
state
at
all,
but
the
first
argument
we
made
in
our
brief
is
that
they
were
entitled
to
look
at
the
out
of
state
conduct
in
this
case,
because
bmw
had
constructed
an
engine
that
was
a
nationwide
engine
and
couldn't
figure
out
a
way
to
tailor
it
so
that
it
wouldn't
do
harm
to
alabama.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
except--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
but
it--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
at
least--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
recall
that
they
were
trying
to
solve
the
alabama
problem,
and
even
then
they
couldn't
find
a
way
to
do
it,
right--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--so
they
didn't
proffer...
they
certainly
didn't
proffer
a
way
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
can
only
once
deter
them.
it
has
deterred
them,
right.
they
have
stopped,
so
there
is
no
longer
a--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
sure.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right,
i
do.
i
want
to
address
both
those.
here's
what
the
record
shows
about
the
number
of
cars.
plaintiffs
got
discovery
from
bmw
of
the
records
of
repainting
that
they
still
had.
remember,
this
thing
had
been
going
on
for
9
1/2
years,
and
so
on
the
record
it
was
explained
to
the
court,
we
only
got
discovery
for
portions
where,
you
know,
particular
places
where
they
had
them.
what
they
got
were
5,856
repainted
cars...
that's
in
the
record...
of
which,
983
involved
repainting
that
cost
more
than
300,
and
counsel
said,
now,
we
don't
want
to...
to
the
jury,
we
don't
want
to
bombard
you
with
6,000
of
these,
so
we'll
give
you
the
983
that
are
more
than
300
of
repainting,
and
that's
where...
of
those
983,
14
were
alabama
cars,
so
we
don't...
there's
no
evidence
as
to
how
many
of
the
other
6...
roughly
5,000
were
alabama
or
not.
but
beyond
that,
there's
a
very
important
thing
in
the
record.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay,
now--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
for
this
one
person.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
let
me
explain
the
rational
theory,
and
i
leave
it
to
the
court
whether
the
court
wants
to
say
the
due
process
clause
requires
that.
there
is
no
case
that
has
said
that
in
the
past.
the
court
could
say
we
want
that,
and--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--but
i
do
want
to
tell
you
that
they
could
rationally
get
there
if
they
in
fact
did
the
thorough
and
painstaking
review
that
they
claim
they
did.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
that
2
to
3
percent
of
all
the
cars
that
come
to
this
country
from
bmw
have
to
be
repainted.
now,
we
don't
have
the
universe
of
all
the
sales
in
alabama,
but
we
do
have
the
evidence
of
the
sales
by
the
dealer
who
sold
dr.
gore
his
car.
his
testimony,
and
it's
at
page
297
of
the
trial
transcript,
is
that
he
sold
300
to
400
bmw's
a
year.
now,
2
to
3
percent
of
that
would
be
6
to
12
cars
a
year
at
that
one
dealer.
for
9
1/2
years
this
practice
continued,
from
january
of
'83
to
july
of
'92.
nine
and
a
half
years'
time,
6
to
12,
would
be
something
between
57
and
114
cars
for
that
one
dealer.
the
record
also
shows
in
plaintiff's
exhibit
13
that
there
were
at
least
four
other
dealers
in
alabama
that
were
bmw
dealers.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
don't
think
it's
right...
and
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
may...
so
i'm
not
sure
i
can
finish.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
in
fraud
cases,
very
few
people
sue.
if
you're
going
to
divide
it
up
and
say
each
person
only
gets
a
fraction,
then
the
defrauder
will
never
be
brought
to
a
halt.
the
profit
will
never
be
taken
out.
