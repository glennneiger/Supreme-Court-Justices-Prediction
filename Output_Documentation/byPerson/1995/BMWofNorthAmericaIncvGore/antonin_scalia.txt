justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
say
that
they're
going
to
recompute
the
amount,
or...
you're
in
direct
disagreement
here
with
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--colleague,
mr.
frey,
who
says
that
it's
clear
under
alabama
law
that
what
the
remittitur
amounts
to
is
a
reduction
of
the
verdict
to
the
maximum
constitutionally
permissible
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
dispute
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why...
if
the
alabama
court
does
what
you
suggest,
if
only
in
the
pure
excessiveness
cases
they
reduce
it
to
the
constitutional
maximum,
but
in
error
cases
they
reevaluate
on
their
own,
there
is
simply
no
explanation
for
the
term,
constitutionally
reasonable
punitive
damages
award.
the
court
would
have
simply
said,
we
hold
that
a
reasonable
punitive
damages
award
in
this
case
is
2
million--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
a
remittitur
of
the
4
million
jury
verdict
is
appropriate.
they
don't
say
that.
they
say,
we
hold
that
a
constitutionally
reasonable
punitive
damages
award.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
adverb
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah...
ah...
ah...
ah...
ah,
that's
a
big
qualifier
you
just
threw
in
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
justice
kennedy
had
that
qualifier
in
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
hear
it
in
his
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
certainly
does
in
criminal
cases
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
recidivist
criminals--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
punished
more
severely
if
they've
committed
crimes
not
only
in
that
jurisdiction
but
in
other
jurisdictions.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
bad
a
person
you
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
really
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying,
do
we
have
to
grapple
with
all
of
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
both
you
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
opponent
concede
that
these
out
of
state
things
should
not
have
been
considered
by
the
jury.
i
mean,
i
thought
that
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
purposes
of
punishing
those
acts
separately.
justice
antonin
scalia
--executives
might
think
of
faced
with
this
problem.
would
be
unwilling
to
do
it,
is
what
you
mean.
you
don't
even
have
that--
--they'd
have
problems
nationwide
doing
it
this
way,
that
they're
not
going
to
stop
in
alabama
alone.
you
don't
even
have
evidence
they
were
unwilling
to
do
it.
