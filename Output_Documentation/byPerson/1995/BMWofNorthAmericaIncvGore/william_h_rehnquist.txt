chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94
896,
bmw
of
north
america
v.
ira
gore.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they're
criminal
cases.
i'm
not
so
sure
the
same
standards
carry
over
from
criminal
cases
to
a
civil
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
frey.
mr.
gottesman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
insist
that
an
objection
be
made
during
the
course
of
argument?
that's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do,
to
stand
up
in
the
middle
of
your
opponent's
argument
to
the
jury
and
object.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
it
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
really
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
each
state
which
has
some--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
would
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
generalize
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
absence
of
decided
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
much
of
our
jurisprudence
in
the
recidivist
statutes
do
you
think
is
dependent
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
which
of
course
doesn't
have
any
applicability
to
a
civil
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
perhaps
the
reason
that
the
courts
have
said
that
you're
not
sentencing
again
for
the
same
conduct
in
a
recidivist
statute
is
because
there
would
be
a
double
jeopardy
problem
if
you
were,
and
you're
not
bound
down
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
a
civil
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
respondent
says
that
bmw
had
stopped
shipping
cars
to
alabama
by
the
time
of
this
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
make
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
many
2
million
awards
can
alabama
give
in
a
case
like
this--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--against
bmw?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
answer
the
question
briefly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gottesman.
mr.
frey,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frey.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94-896,
bmw
of
north
america
versus
gore
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
