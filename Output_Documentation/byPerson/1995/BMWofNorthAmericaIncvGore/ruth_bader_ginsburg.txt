justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
mr.
frey,
that
came
in
only
because
a
lawyer
said
it
in
summation.
no
judge
charged
it.
no
alabama
law
permitted
it.
it
was
an
impermissible
summation.
there
was
no
objection
to
what
the
lawyer
said.
the
source
for
that
notion
that
you
could
multiply
by
all
the
incidents
came
from
an
unobjected
to
lawyer's
summation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
it's
dead
wrong.
you're
not
supposed
to
compute
the
size
of
the
remedy
on
that
basis
so
you
can't
trace
that
error
to
any
flaw
in
the
alabama
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
was
the
objection...
i
didn't
see
it...
to
the
lawyer's
summation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frey,
there
was
no
objection
after
the
lawyer
made
that
statement
in
summation,
and
isn't
it
common--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
perhaps
we
won't...
i
don't
want
to
detract
you
on
this
any
longer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
can
give
me
the
place
in
the
record
where
the
judge
makes
an
error
of
law
in
saying
it's
proper
for
the
jury
to
take
into
account
the...
to
use
as
a
multiplier
sales
in
other
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
frey,
even
if
you
were
right
about
what
the
record
would
reveal,
and
even
if
we
can
pass
over
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the
statement
that
was
made,
the
alabama
supreme
court
itself
said,
such
evidence
may
not
be
considered
in
setting
the
size
of
the
civil
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frey,
i
think
that
that
argument
is
not
genuinely
in
the
case,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
there's
a
statement
made
by
the
lawyer.
it's
not
in
the
judge's
charge.
the
alabama
supreme
court
says
that
was
wrong.
the
jury
determined
liability.
the
alabama
supreme
court
then...
we
think,
after
a
thorough
and
painstaking
review
of
the
record,
2
million
is
an
apt
award,
and
that's
what
we
set.
shouldn't
we,
as
a
federal
court,
give
the
alabama
supreme
court
the
respect
of
assuming
that
once
it
recognized
the
extraterritorial
computation
was
no
good,
it
then
set
what
it
considered
a
permissible
award
without
regard
to
any
extraterritorial
multiplier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
just
assume
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
the
jury
has
determined
liability.
we,
as
judges,
are
determining
amount,
and
the
amount
we
as
judges
arrive
at
has
nothing
to
do
with
multiplier
based
on
out
of
state
sales,
it
has
to
do
with
what
happened
inside
alabama
and
the
amount
we
set
for
that
is
2
million.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
frey,
i
keep
coming
back
to
where
the
state
has.
there
was
nothing
in
alabama
statute
law.
there
was
nothing
in
the
judge's
charge
that
permitted
the
size
of
the
civil
penalty
to
be
set
by
the
number
of
incidents
all
over
the
country.
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
that
was
wrong,
and
then
it
said,
we
are
determining
the
size
of
a
verdict
that
would
be
permissible
without
regard
to
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
hicks
case
relied,
as
you
read
it,
on
a
judge's
charge.
there
was
no
source
of
alabama
law.
there
was
no
authoritative
alabama
law--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
forgetting
what
the
jury
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
why
we
don't
owe
the
alabama
supreme
court
the
respect
of
saying
that
when
it
recognized
that
what
the
jury
did
was
impermissible,
it
then
substituted
a
figure
that
it
thought
a
proper
construction
of
the
law,
not
permit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
aspect--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
not
quirky.
there
was
a
question
raised,
this
is
an
ordinary...
this
is
a
strange
case.
it
will
never
happen
again,
presumably,
because
trial
judges
will
be
instructed
by
the
alabama
supreme
court's
absolutely
clear
statement
such
evidence
may
not
be
considered
in
setting
the
size
of
the
civil
penalty,
so
this
is
not
going
to
be
repeating
the
issue
in
alabama.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
one
issue...
your
second
issue
is
the
one
that
will
be
a
continuing
one.
is
2
million
too
much
for
this
kind
of
injury?
but
the
other
one
you
would
be
asking
us
to
make
a
correction
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
already
made--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--an
issue
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
which
will
never
repeat
in
this
jurisdiction,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
did--
--wouldn't
every
defense
lawyer
be
able,
then,
to
tell
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
please
instruct
the
jury
that
such
evidence
may
not
be
considered
in
setting
the
size
of
the
civil
penalty?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
the
marching
orders
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
given.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gottesman,
if
we
don't
know
what
operation
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
fact
performed,
on
a
remittitur
there
are
three,
at
least
three
positions,
the
highest
a
jury
could
award,
the
least
that
a
jury,
reasonable
jury
would
award,
and
what
the
court
itself
thinks
is
reasonable.
we
don't
know
which
of
those
three
choices.
do
we
make
an
assumption,
or
do
we
remand
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
say,
tell
us
what
you
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
gottesman,
there
is
another
multiplier
that
is
alive.
the
other,
i
quite
agree
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
said,
that's
wrong,
you
don't
do
it,
but
this
one
2
million,
if
you
just
take
account
of
the
14
other
in
alabama--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
every
plaintiff
get
the
2
million,
and
what
about
the
other
states?
how
tolerable
is
a
single
award
of
2
million
when
you
consider
that
that
2
million
can
be
replicated
again
and
again
and
again?
