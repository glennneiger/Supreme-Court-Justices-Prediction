mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
when
an
automobile
comes
off
the
assembly
line
it
has
to
be
transported
to
the
location
where
it's
distributed.
in
the
course
of
that
happening,
it
sometimes
suffers
some
damage
and
bmw,
like
other
manufacturers,
has
means
at
hand
to
restore
the
car
to
factory
condition
as
best
they
can
using
the
same
techniques
that
would
be
used
in
the
factory
if
the
same
incident
happened
in
the
factory
parking
lot.
the
question
arises,
when
this
happens,
whether
or
under
what
circumstances
there
might
be
an
obligation
or
it
might
be
good
business
practice
to
inform
the
dealers
and
prospective
purchasers
of
the
automobile
that
there
has
been
work
done
on
a
repair
or
refinishing
work.
now,
bmw
looked
at
this
question
in
1983,
and
the
way
they
went
about
that
was
to
examine
the
various
state
laws
that
were
on
the
books
then
that
addressed
the
subject
and
to
comply
with
the
strictest
of
those
laws,
which
was
to
make
disclosure,
or
at
least
not
to
sell
without
disclosure,
any
car
that
had
had
repairs
or
refinishing
that
exceeded
in
cost
3
percent
of
the
manufacturer's
suggested
retail
price.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
do
question
it,
although
i'm
not
questioning
it
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
see,
i
believe
that
what
you
have
here
is
actually
a
species
of
malum
prohibitum
and
not
malum
in
se.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
conduct
is
punishable--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--in
alabama.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
at
the
time
of
the
sale
of
this
car.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
again,
we
are
not
challenging
that.
i
have
difficulty
where
the
evidence
is
not
relevant.
i
question
its
relevance
here
to
any
legitimate
purpose
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely,
and
there's
no
question,
for
instance,
if
it
were
admissible
for
rule
404(b)
kind
of
purposes
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--right,
now
if
intent--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that's
true,
and
i
think
my
problem
with
it,
and
it
may
not
be
a
constitutional
problem,
it's
a
kind
of
rule
403
problem,
that
it's
highly
prejudicial
in
a
case
like
this,
where
it
was
agreed
that
there
was
a
policy
and
there
was
no
question
of
intent--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--you
can
assume--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--you
can
assume
that,
yes.
that's
what
the
alabama
supreme
court
held--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--and
we're
not
challenging
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
i'm
going
to
argue
that
they
couldn't,
but
that
is
a
different
argument.
there
are
two
separate
issues
in
this
case.
the
first
issue
is
whether
bmw
was
punished
for
non
alabama
conduct,
conduct
to
which
alabama
law
does
not
extend,
but
punished
under
alabama
law;
if
so,
whether
that
was
improper--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--and
if
so,
whether
inadequate
remedy
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--this
case
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
highlights
what
is
more
submerged
in
a
lot
of
other
cases,
product
liability,
or
mass
tort,
or
consumer
fraud
cases
where
you
have
nationwide
conduct,
which
is
the
invitation
to
the
jury
to
punish
the
defendant
not
only
for
the
conduct
that
was
done
in
the
state
or
to
the
plaintiff,
or
plaintiffs
in
the
case,
but
to
punish
them
for
their
national
conduct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
on
any--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i'm
not...
except
for
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
holding
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
am,
but
i
don't
accept
your
premise
that
there
was
not
a
proper
objection.
i'd
note--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
it
wasn't
during
the
summation,
but
what
happened
was
there
was
a
motion
in
limine.
during
the
motion
in
limine,
counsel
for
bmw,
who
had
just
been
through
the
yates
trial,
said,
your
honor,
i
know
what
they're
going
to
do
with
this.
they're
going
to
improperly
invite
the
jury
to
punish
on
the
basis
of
sales
outside
of
alabama,
and
the
law
in
those
states
is
different.
it's
not
the
same
as
alabama.
a
lot
of
these
states
have
statutes.
that
was
one
of
the
objections
that
was
made.
i
can
give
you
the
page
of
the
transcript.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
court
had
already
ruled
that
that
was
a
permissible
use
of
the
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
no,
but
i
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
you'd
have
to
look
at
page
451
to
see
our
argument,
of
the
transcript...
the
clerk's
record,
i'm
sorry,
and
then
at
585
to
591
of
the
clerk's
record,
but
i
believe
that
what
happened
here
was
that
we
said
this
improper
use
is
going
to
be
made
and
in
fact
mr.
bolt,
counsel
for
dr.
gore,
said
they
wanted
to
use
it
on
damages.
now,
i
understand
that
there
are
different
ways
in
which
it
can
be
used,
but
because
the
yates
trial
had
already
been
held,
and
it
had
been
used
precisely
in
the
way
it
was
used
here,
and
that
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
i
can't
see
that
we
had
to
do
more,
and
besides--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
agree,
and
i
am
willing
to
accept
that
as
the
premise
and
proceed
to
the
question,
which
is
really
the
question
we
presented,
whether
the
use
of
that
evidence
to
set
the
size
of
the
civil
penalty
was
properly
remedied
by
the
reduction
of
the
punitive
damages
award
from
4
million
to
2
million.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't...
i
believe
it
is
true...
the
situation
is
this.
there
were
statutes--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--okay.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
answer
to
that
is,
the
action
might
not
have
been
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
preemption,
but
the
action
would
have
been,
i
believe,
bound
to
fail.
now,
let
me
say
this.
first
of
all,
at
the
time
of
the
sale
of
the
car
to
dr.
gore,
there
had
not
been
a
single
suit
brought
anywhere
in
the
united
states
on
the
theory
that
not
disclosing
paint
refinishing
is
fraud...
by
the
manufacturer
is
fraud
at
all,
let
alone
in
a
state
that
had
a
statute
that
says
here
is
the
standard
under
our
deceptive
trade
practices
act,
and
then
you
comply
with
that
standard
and
then
we're
going
to
go
ahead
and
not
only
find
you
liable
for
any
damage
that
may
have
been
suffered
but
find
you...
but
punish
you.
now,
there
are...
we
cite
in
our
brief
a
case
from
louisiana
which
held
that
because
the
amount
of
the
refinishing
exceeded
the
statutory
threshold,
there
was
a
cause
of
action,
and
i
have
a
case
from
wisconsin
that
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
that
was
implicit--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--in
the
fact
that
their
decision
turned
on
whether
or
not
it
exceeded
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there's
a
case
called
tesh
v.
best
motors,
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
wisconsin
on
august
15,
1995,
and
the
cite
i
have
is
1995
westlaw
478413,
which
is
to
the
same
effect.
that
is,
it
turned
on
that--
now,
let
me
make
the
point,
to
my
mind
there
is
something
slightly
kafkaesque
about
saying,
this
is
the
standard,
more
than
3
percent,
you
must
disclose
less
than
3
percent.
it's
not
material,
which
is
what
the
current
alabama
statute
says,
and
then
turning
around
and
solely
on
the
evidence
of
compliance
with
that
statute...
solely
on
the
evidence
of
conduct
that
complies
with
that
statute,
no
separate
evidence
of
fraudulent
intent
except
what
you
infer
from
the
conduct...
holding
somebody
liable
for
fraud
and
punitive
damages.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
guess...
i
guess
my
problem
with
this
is
that
if
virtually
every
state
that
has
considered
this
conduct
has
found
that
there...
that
in
a
statute,
has
set
a
statutory
threshold...
those
statutes
are
passed
to
balance
the
interests
of
consumers,
and
having
information
that's
important
to
them,
with
the
interests
of
the
business
community
in
doing
business
free
from
restrictions
that
may
increase
costs
or
have
other
adverse
effects.
now,
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
that...
it's
hard
to
say
that
this
conduct
is
malum
in
se,
and
remember,
the
only
evidence--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we're
not
saying
that
to
this
court.
i'm
not--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
no.
the
argument...
on
this
particular
point,
the
argument
about
the
lack
of
any
notice
that
this
conduct
was
unlawful,
and
there
was
no
notice
in
any
judicial
decision,
any
statute,
or
any
regulation
anywhere
in
the
united
states
that
this
conduct
would
be
considered
fraud,
but
the
only
argument
i'm
making
here
is
that
that
bears
on
the
reprehensibility
of
the
conduct
when
you're
assessing
whether
it's
excessive.
now,
for
purposes
of
my
argument
about
extraterritorial
punishment,
it
does
not
matter,
because
the
problem
here
is
that
alabama
law
was
applied,
and
i
think
nobody
can
dispute
that
this
case
was
decided
only
under
alabama
law.
alabama
law
was
applied
to
conduct
that
alabama
had
no
business
regulating.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
the
issue
we're
raising
is
that
we
believe
the
constitution
prohibits
it
from
doing
that,
and
the
reason
we
believe
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--all
right,
and
my
answer
to
that
is,
what
is
wrong
with
that
is
that
that
is
first
of
all
not
what
they
did.
it's
not
what
alabama
law
calls
for
them
to
do.
it
is
very
clear
under
alabama
law
that
what
they
do
is,
they
reduce
the
punishment
to
the
largest
amount
that
is
constitutionally
permissible.
that
is
not
the
same
as
having
a
de
novo
determination
by
the
court
of
what
the
punishment
should
be.
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
the
court
had
determined
the
punishment
de
novo,
that
we
would
not
have
an
objection
based
on
what
happened
before
the
jury,
but
alabama
law
is
clear
that
you
defer
to
the
jury.
our
problem
is,
you're
deferring
to
a
jury
which
the
alabama
court
itself
recognized
imposed
punishment
on
an
unconstitutional
basis.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
have
no
problem...
i
think
this
was
justice
o'connor's
question
in
the
beginning.
i'm
not
here
saying
that
alabama
cannot
consider
that
conduct
to
enhance
the
punishment
that
should
be
imposed
for
every
plaintiff
who
sues,
not
just
dr.
gore,
and
it's
an
issue
i
want
to
talk
about
which
is
very
important
that
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
going
to
get
to,
but...
but
you
have
to
decide...
there
is
a
difference...
the
witte
case
that
justice
o'connor
wrote
for
the
court
last
year
recognized
that
there
is
a
difference
between
punishing
for
the
tort
that
is
being
adjudicated
and
enhancing
the
punishment
for
that
based
on
other
conduct,
and
punishing
for
the
other
conduct.
now,
the
alabama
supreme
court
was
quite
clear,
and
i
don't
see
how
anybody
could
fail
to
conclude
each
additional
sale
that
took
place
outside
of
alabama
was
punished
an
additional
4,000
by
this
jury.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
used...
in
my
view,
you
cannot
let
that
kind
of
a
subterfuge
conceal
the
fact
that
the
more
activity
which
presumptively
we
have
to
assume
was
lawful
in
other
states
that
was
engaged
in,
the
larger
the
punishment
that
alabama
is
imposing
on
the
defendant.
now,
there
is
a
problem
with
that,
it
seems
to
me.
the
problem
is,
the
reality
is,
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
recognized
this,
that
what
happened
here
was
that
the
punishment
was
being
measured
by...
in
order
to
take
away
the
profits.
this
was
the
express
purpose,
take
away
the
profits
that
bmw
made
in
new
jersey
or
hawaii
or
california
from
selling
cars
that
for
all
we
know
were
perfectly
lawfully
sold
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
that
state.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
have--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--okay--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
have
two
separate
arguments,
and
i
need
to
be
clear
about
this.
the
first
argument
has
to
do
with
the
remedy
if
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
in
the
way
the
punishment
was
measured.
is
the
remittitur
to
the
constitutionally
maximum
amount
an
adequate
remedy?
and
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
from
a
case
called
hicks
v.
oklahoma
at
447
u.s.
345,
where
the
court
said,
had
the
members
of
the
jury
been
correctly
instructed
in
the
this
case,
they
could
have
imposed
any
sentence
of
not
less
than
10
years.
that
is,
they
could
have
imposed
a
sentence
of
less
than
the
one
they
did.
then
the
court
said,
it
is
argued
that
all
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
denial
of
a
procedural
right
of
exclusively
state
concern.
where,
however,
a
state
has
provided
for
the
imposition
of
criminal
punishment
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
jury,
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
the
defendant's
interest
in
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
is
merely
a
matter
of
state
procedural
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
your
honor,
it's...
there
is
a
vast
difference,
and
this
hicks
case
makes
it
clear,
between
determining
the
verdict
that
is
proper
for
this
conduct,
and
determining
the
largest
constitu--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--if
the
jury
had
not
believed,
and
had
not
punished
for
non
alabama
sales,
it
presumably...
we
don't
know
for
sure,
but
the
best
evidence
is
that
it
would
have
imposed
a
punishment
of
56,000
if
it--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
but
you
can't--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
what...
it
substituted
a
figure
that
it
thought
was
the
largest
figure
that...
the
largest
amount
that
a
jury
could
punish
bmw.
when
that
happens,
what
happens
is
the
right
to
have
the
jury
determine
the
punishment
is
wiped
out,
because
this
jury
would
have
picked
a
smaller
number.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
if
it
were
reduced
to
56,000,
that
would
expunge
the
effect
of
the
extraterritorial
punishment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
wouldn't...
there
would
not
be
any.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
saying
that
we
are
still
subject
to
extraterritorial
punishment.
that's--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
the
due
process--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
we
rely
on
the
commerce
clause
for
the
proposition
that
it's
wrong
to
punish
us,
that
alabama
cannot
project
its
law
outside
of
alabama
to
do
what
dr.
gore
said,
which
is
to
force
bmw
to
stop
its
conduct
everywhere.
for
that
we
rely
on
the
commerce
clause,
the
due
process
clause,
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
on
the
question
of
remedy,
i
think
we
rely
on
the
proposition
which
is
implicit
in
the
due
process
clause
that
if
there
is
a
violation
of
your
federal
constitutional
rights,
ordinarily,
barring
exceptional
circumstances,
you're
entitled
to
an
appropriate
remedy
that
expunges
the
effect
of
that
violation,
and
that's
what
we're
asking
for
here,
and
we
say
the
reduction
to
2
million
does
not
expunge
the
effect,
and
i
think
you'll
see
when
you
look
at
the
hicks
case
or
the
death
penalty
cases,
where
a
jury
imposes
the
death
penalty--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
might
not,
although
certainly
we're
dealing
with
punishment
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
i
want
to
be
completely
clear
about
that.
what
they
cannot
do
is
punish
for
that
conduct
if
they
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
that
conduct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
the
constitution
would
permit
the
application
of
either
alabama
or
tennessee
law
in
that
circumstance.
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
one
sale,
and
say--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
no,
no,
because...
no,
it
can't
do
that,
because
it
has
no
interest...
it
cannot
take
into
account
sales
to
residents
of
tennessee
or
illinois
or
some
place
that
are
made
in
tennessee.
it
can't--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
because
i
think
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
in
healy
v.
beer
institute
people
were
going
to
new
york
to
buy
the
beer
because
it
was
cheaper.
the
court
said,
well,
that
doesn't
give
connecticut
the
right
to
enact
a
system
which
affects
the
prices
that
are
going
to
be
charged
in
new
york.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
apportionment
issue
is
very
important,
and
it
relates
to
a
different
question,
which
is
our
excessiveness
argument.
remember,
even
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
us
on
everything
we've
been
talking
about
so
far
and
were
to
accept
2
million
as
a
de
novo
punishment
set
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
that
expunged
any
error
that
may
have
occurred,
there
is
the
second
issue
in
this
case,
which
is,
is
2
million
too
much
for
what
happened
to
dr.
gore?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
can't
agree...
well,
in
the
narrow
sense
that
it
comes
up
here,
that's
true,
but
in
the
broader
sense
the
question
would
be,
is
the
defendant,
for
instance,
entitled
to
have
the
jury
told
that
they
can't
punish
for
conduct
that
occurs
outside--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--oh,
it
will
repeat
in
a
slightly
different
form
where
it's
less
obvious
what's
happening,
in
the
form
that
is
common
in
product
liability
cases,
for
instance,
where
the
argument
is
made
that
there
are
so
many
thousands
of
people
around
the
country
who
have
bought
this
product,
or
been
injured
by
it,
or
so
many
thousands...
and
the
jury
will
be
invited
to
punish
for
that
without
any
kind
of
explicit
mathematical
formula,
and
that
will
raise
a
different
problem,
but
the
first
step
on
that
particular
road
is
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
the
court
would
hold
that,
i
think
that
would
be
extremely
valuable
in
the
development
of
the
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
less
clear,
and
i
can
tell
you
from
looking
at
this
litigation
around
the
country
that
this
problem
recurs
in
a
slightly
more
insidious
or
less,
you
know,
obvious
form
than
it
recurred
in
this
case,
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
is.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
all
right.
no,
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
first
part--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
first
part
of
the
problem,
justice
breyer,
is
not
a
problem
any
more
because
the
court
has
decided
in
haslip
and
in
txo
and
in
honda
that
there
does
exist
a
substantive
due
process
limit.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
i
understand
the
question
is
what,
and
i
think
there
are...
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
inherently
cannot
be
reduced
to
a
mathematical
formula.
you
have
to
consider
the
reprehensibility
of
the
conduct,
other
civil
penalties,
and
in
this
case
i
think
it's
extremely
important
that
the
penalties
provided
under
the
deceptive
trade
practices
act
for
fraud
in
selling
automobiles
is
2,000
if
it's
a
civil
penalty,
or
treble
damages
plus
attorney's
fees
in
a
private
action.
there
is
a
fascinating
question
about
whether
the
denominator
of
the
fraction,
when
you're
looking
at
the
reasonable
relationship
between
the
punishment
and
the
wrong,
is
the
plaintiff's
own
injury,
or
potential
injury,
or
whether
it's
all
14.
i
wish
i
had
the
chance
to
talk
about
this,
because
there's
a
procedural
due
process
as
well
as
a
substantive
due
process
aspect
to
this
question,
but
i
haven't
got
the
time,
so
i
think
i'd
better
reserve
what
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
i
would
like,
then
to...
first
of
all,
on
this
waiver
argument,
which
is
brand
new,
it's
not
made
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
was
not
made
in
the
merits
brief,
we'd
like
an
opportunity
to
submit
a
post
argument
brief.
that's
the
first
half
of
mr.
gottesman's
argument.
i'd
like
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question
with
a
procedural
reason
why
it
violates
due
process
not
to
divide,
as
you
suggested,
and
to
allow
dr.
gore
to
collect
the
full
amount,
and
that
reason
comes...
you
can
see
it
from
the
first
issue
in
phillips
petroleum
v.
shutts,
which
was
the
standing
of
the
defendant
to
complain
about
the
plaintiffs,
jurisdiction
over
the
plaintiffs.
what
you
have
here
is
a
one
way
class
action
under
which,
if
bmw
wins,
it
gets
no
credit.
it
won
the
yates
case
on
punitive
damages,
zero
punitive
damages.
now
along
comes
dr.
gore,
and
bmw
loses
the
dr.
gore
case,
and
the
jury
imposes
the
full
punishment
necessary
to
deter
the
entire
conduct
everywhere
in
the
united
states.
that
is
manifestly
unfair
to
bmw,
because
what
it
does
not
allow
for
is
the
fact
that
every
other
jury
that
hears
this
might
find
that
there
is
no
punishable
conduct.
