mr.
frey,
i'm
glad
we've
come
to
this
point,
because
i
think
it's
a
very
important
issue
that
we
haven't
considered
in
these
punitive
damages
cases
before.
what
would
happen
if
the
alabama
resident
went
to
tennessee,
bought
his
car
there,
and
then
came
back
to
alabama?
what
measure...
and
he
sues
in
alabama
court
under
alabama
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
alabama
count
the
sales
both
in
tennessee
and
in
alabama?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
could
it
count
all...
could
it
take
into
account
all
of
the
sales
under
this
alleged
fraudulent--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
why
not,
if
alabama
residents
are
going
there
to
buy
their
cars?
why
couldn't
they
say,
well,
we'll
take
tennessee
sales
plus
alabama
sales,
or
if
we
have
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
we
have
the
metropolitan
area
around
the
district
of
columbia--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
would
have
to
do
if
we
adopted
your
rule
is
to
have
a
jurisprudence
of
apportionment
something
like
our
interstate
tax
jurisprudence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
agree
with
the
alabama
supreme
court
that
the
jury
could
not
use
the
number
of
similar
acts
that
a
defendant
committed
in
other
jurisdictions
as
a
multiplier?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
because
of
interstate
commerce
concerns
or
due
process
concerns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--on
interstate...
does
interstate
commerce
enter
into
the
calculus?
suppose
alabama
enacted
a
statute
saying
that
an
auto
company
that
defrauded
consumers
in
alabama
had
to
disgorge
all
of
its
national
profits,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
sale
occurs
in
alabama,
they
do
business
in
alabama,
but
the
measure
of
disgorgement
is
profits
nationwide.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about...
is
there
any
interstate
commerce
objection
to
the
statute
that
i
hypothesize?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
you're
not
sure
whether
or
not
there
is
an
interstate
commerce
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let's
just
assume
that
either
a
statute,
and
of
course
then
we'll
next
get
to
the
fact
that
our
hypothetical
jury
instruction
considers
out
of
state
conduct
as
a
multiplier
in
fixing
the
amount
of
the
award,
or
out
of
state
profits
as
being
part
of
the
sum
that
must
be
disgorged
to
this
plaintiff.
are
there
not
interstate
commerce
concerns
with
such
measures
of
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
how
do
you...
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
if
you
say
there
might
well
be,
then
i
take
it
you
concede
the
surface
plausibility
or
reasonable
content
to
the
proposition
that
alabama
may
not
punish
by
way
of
damages
for
acts
that
have
occurred
out
of
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
not
only
double
jeopardy,
it's
the
problem
that
a
state
can't
really,
consistent
with
known
juris
prudential
postulates,
divide
up
a
sentence
and
say,
well
now,
you
serve
this
part
of
your
sentence
in
nevada,
and
this
part
of
your
aggravated
sentence
back
in
california,
where
you
committed
the
crime,
but
we
can
do
that
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
can
do
that
with
apportionment.
we
do
it
with
interstate
taxes
all
of
the
time.
