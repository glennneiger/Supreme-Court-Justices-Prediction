justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
gottesman,
in
the
remittitur
proceeding
did
they
also
bring
out
the
fact
that
in
a
lot
of
states
these
sales
would
not
have
been
unlawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
evidence
that
they
would
have
been
unlawful
in
any
state,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there's
a
presumption
of
innocence,
we
would
presume--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--all
these
sales
were
lawful.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
brought
out
at
the
remittitur
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
you
say
there's
no
evidence
one
way
or
another.
did
they
at
least
have
before
them
the
fact
that
there
are
all
these
statutes
out
there
that
do
have
this
3
percent
standard
in
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
wasn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
relevant
to
culpability?
would
you
explain
that?
does
it
show
that
they
were
honorable
or
dishonorable
if
they're
complying
with
the
law
throughout
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
said
to
me
a
moment
ago
there
was
no
example
of
a
case
anywhere
in
the
states
that
reached
the
same
result
as
the
alabama
court
did
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
you
presume
that
the
conduct
is
innocent
unless
proven
guilty,
there's
no
proof
that
they
violated
the
law
anywhere
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
now
then,
in
that
regard,
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
out
of
state
conduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
everybody
concedes
it.
i'm
still
curious,
why
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
lot
of
lawful
transactions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
goes
to
show
983
lawful
transactions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
their
interest
in
either
changing
it
or
maintaining
it
be
the
business
of
the
alabama
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand.
why
does
alabama
have
any
authority
to
tell
them
what
policy
to
follow
in
new
york?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
it
was...
in
your
brief,
you
argue
that
it
was
appropriate
to
deter
the
nationwide
policy.
have
you
abandoned
that
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
said
it
over
and
over
again.
you
said
over
and
over
again
that
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
jolt
was
necessary
to
change
a
national
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
adhere
to
that
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
or
not.
there's
no
evidence
that
even
if
they
knew
they
were
liable
for
compensatory
damages
they
wouldn't
have
changed
their
policy.
there
isn't
anything
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
there's
no
evidence
they
couldn't
figure
out
a
way
to
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
one
phone
call
doesn't
discuss
all
possibilities
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
have
this
one
phone
call,
they
got
a
problem
in
alabama,
this
is
the
way
we'll
try
to
solve
our
alabama
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
all
that
shows.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
you
including
the
repainting
jobs
less
than
300?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
alabama.
in
1990,
the
respondent
the
dr.
gore
purchased
a
new
bmw
sports
sedan
from
an
authorized
bmw
dealership.
nine
months
later,
although
he
had
not
noticed
any
flaws
in
the
appearance
of
the
car,
dr.
gore
was
informed
that
parts
of
the
car’s
exterior
had
been
repainted,
apparently
because
the
car
had
suffered
acid
rain
damage
after
it
left
the
factory
in
germany.
dr.
gore
filed
suit
against
petitioner,
bmw
of
north
america
seeking
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
to
bmw’s
failure
to
advice
him
that
the
car
had
been
partially
repainted.
compensatory
damages
are
intended
to
compensate
the
victim
over
a
wrong,
punitive
damages
are
meant
to
punish
wrongful
conduct
and
deter
its
reputation.
at
trial,
bmw
acknowledged
that
it
had
a
nationwide
policy
under
which
the
damage
car
was
sold
as
new
without
disclosure
of
repair
if
the
repairs
cost
less
than
3%
of
the
car’s
suggested
retail
price.
at
the
time
the
policy
was
adapted
in
1983,
through
the
date
of
dr.
gore’s
purchase,
bmw’s
policy
was
at
least
stringent
as
any
state's
statutory
disclosure
requirement.
thus,
for
example,
eleven
state
legislatures
require
disclosure
of
only
pre-sale
repairs
costing
more
than
6%
of
the
suggested
retail
price.
because
refinishing
dr.
gore’s
car
cost
less
than
bmw’s
3%
threshold,
the
repairs
were
not
disclosed.
in
support
of
his
claim
for
punitive
damages,
dr.
gore
introduced
at
trial
evidence
that
bmw
had
sold
as
new
without
disclosure
approximately
1000
repaired
cars
nationwide.
fourteen
of
those
sales
occurred
in
alabama.
the
jury
awarded
that
dr.
gore
$4,000.00
in
compensatory
damages
and
$4
million
in
punitive
damages.
on
appeal,
the
alabama
supreme
court
found
that
the
jury
had
improperly
computed
the
amount
of
punitive
damages
by
multiplying
dr.
gore’s
compensatory
damages
by
the
amount
of
similar
sales
in
the
entire
united
states.
the
court
therefore
held
that
bmw
was
entitled
to
a
reduction
and
jury
award
and
the
$2
million
was
inappropriate,
punitive
sanction
under
the
circumstances.
in
previous
cases
we
have
held
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
the
imposition
of
a
"grossly
excessive"
award
of
punitive
damages.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
consider
bmw's
claim
that
$2
million
sanction
imposed
in
this
case
is
so
excessive
as
to
violate
its
constitutional
right
to
due
process.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
we
agree
with
that
court
that
reliance
on
bmw
sales
in
other
states
was
improper.
no
state
may
punish
a
defendant
for
out-of-state
conduct
that
did
not
affect
the
state’s
residence
and
that
was
presumptively
lawful
where
it
occurred.
to
do
so
it
would
interfere
with
the
policy
choices
of
other
states.
we
therefore
consider
the
constitutionality
of
this
award
in
light
of
the
conduct
which
alabama
may
legitimately
seeks
to
punish
and
to
deter.
that
is
the
sale
of
repainted
cars
in
alabama
without
disclosure.
elementary
notions
of
fairness
dictate
that
a
person
receives
notice
not
only
of
the
conduct
that
will
subject
him
to
punishment
but
also
the
severity
of
the
penalty
that
may
be
imposed.
three
guide
posts
each
of
with
indicates
that
bmw
did
not
receive
adequate
notice
of
the
magnitude
of
the
sanction
alabama
might
impose
lead
us
to
conclude
that
the
$2
million
punitive
award
for
selling
this
repainted
car
is
grossly
excessive.
first,
the
conduct
was
only
minimally
reprehensible.
the
harm
inflicted
was
purely
economic
no
one
tells
that
safety
has
put
at
risk
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
bmw
is
a
repeat
offender.
second,
the
500:1
ratio
of
punitive
damages
to
compensatory
damages
is
unusually
large
in
the
absence
of
particularly
egregious
conduct.
third,
the
punitive
award
is
substantially
greater
than
the
statutory
fines
available
in
alabama
and
elsewhere
for
comparable
misconduct.
