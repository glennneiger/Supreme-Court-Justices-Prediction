mr.
frey,
i
guess
alabama
at
the
time
did
not
have
a
statute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
effect
dealing
with
the
subject.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
question
whether
alabama
courts
could
properly
find
some
award
of
punitive
damages
here
for
at
least
the
conduct--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
occurred
in
alabama
at
that
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
before
us
in
this
case,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
take
it
on
the
assumption
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--punitive
damages
could
be
awarded--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
alabama--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--at
the
time
this
incident
occurred.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
we
also
assume
that
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
during
the
course
of
trial
for
evidence
to
be
admitted
on
the
existence
and
frequency
of
similar
conduct
outside
of
alabama
to
show
a
course
of
conduct
or
the
defendant's
state
of
mind
or
something
of
that
sort?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
haven't
there
been
many
cases,
including
ones
decided
by
this
court,
where
evidence--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
other
similar
conduct
outside
the
jurisdiction
has
been
admitted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
just
admissible
to
prove
the
intent--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
egregiousness
of
the
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
again,
do
we
assume--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--here
that
the
evidence
of
conduct
out
of
state
properly
was
admissible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
this
case
boil
down
to
kind
of
a
fluke
because
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
this
multiplier
theory
instead
of...
what
if
the
jury...
what
if
it
had
not
been
presented
to
the
jury
that
way,
and
just
the
egregiousness
of
what
happened
to
the
plaintiff
here,
and
the
fact
that
similar
instances
occurred
elsewhere,
it
was
a
standard
practice
of
the
company,
could
the
jury
properly
have
awarded
the
4
million
in
punitives
based
on
conduct
in
alabama
alone?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
know
you
are,
but
is
that
because
this
case
has
peculiar
facts?
i
mean,
could--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
grant
a
remittitur,
and
how
do
we
know
that
what
it
did
in
granting
the
remittitur
is
somehow
unconstitutional,
and
are
you
relying
on
the
due
proces
clause--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
the
commerce
clause,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
principle
is
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
tells
us
what
they
did
in
granting
the
remittitur
was
unconstitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
do
you
rely
on
the
due
process
clause
or
the
commerce
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
yet
to
hear
your
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
can't
a
state
court
in
a
criminal
case
consider
conduct
that
occurs
out
of
state
at
the
time
of
imposing
sentence--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
determine
the
sentence
range?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
true
even
where
there
has
been
a
motion
in
limine
in
advance
of
the
argument
and
the
issue
is
resolved?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
a
motion
in
limine
addressed
or
should
be
interpreted
to
address
counsel's
argument
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
alabama
law
would
then
not
permit
a
new
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--including
alabama
by
the
time
of
trial--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
which--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--makes
it
particularly--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
admittedly
it
was
applied
here
by
the
jury,
as
has
been
determined
by
the
alabama
supreme
court,
in
a
way
that
directly
tried
to
affect
the
conduct
of
bmw
in
other
states.
