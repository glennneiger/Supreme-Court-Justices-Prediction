justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
just
say
a
word
about
excessiveness?
that
is,
as
i
see
it,
and
i
thought
that
was
probably
in
this
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
have
4,000
of
damage
of
economic
nature.
a
company
is
going
to
have
to
pay
2
million
in
punitives.
i
take
it
the
total
amount
of
evidence
of
this
kind
of
conduct
in
alabama
amounts
to
56,000,
so
i
suppose
the
underlying
question
which
some
people
complain
about
is
that
juries
are
free
to
transfer
possibly
the
entire
gross
national
product,
or
some
significant
portion
thereof,
under
a
standard
that
has
no
limit.
i'm
not
saying
i
buy
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
problem...
the
problem
is,
is
there
not
some
federal
limitation
and
then,
of
course,
it
raises,
what?
what
is
the
standard,
federally--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
could
be
possible
to
prevent
tremendous
transfers
of
property
on
minimal
evidence
of
significant
harm?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what,
is
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
would
deter
them
with
a
judgment
of
a
billion
dollars--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
so
does
that
mean
they
can
award
2
billion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
5...
my
question,
really,
i
want
to
get
you
back--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
what
you
were
about
to
say.
you
were
saying,
number
1,
there's
evidence
of
hundreds
of
cars.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
you
have
two
prongs
to
it,
and
i
want
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say,
and
what
i'm
thinking
in
my
mind,
though
i'm
not
adopting
it,
is,
is
there
some
procedural
aspect
of
due
process
that
says
when
there
is
no
obvious
relationship
between
damages
and
minimal
harm,
when
historically
it
can't
be
justified,
at
least
the
court
has
a
procedural
obligation
to
explain
some
rational
theory,
maybe
a
little
stronger
than
a
legislature,
maybe
the
same,
maybe
weaker.
and
the
second
thing
is,
is
there
any
such
theory
here,
whether
you
say
hundreds,
or
whether
you
say
two,
or
whether
you
say
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
are
the...
that's
the
excessive
part
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--bothering
me,
and
i
think
you
were
going
to
discuss--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--explain,
assume
that's
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
still,
isn't
there
some
obligation
on
a
court
under
the
due
process
clause...
and
i'm
not
buying
this.
i'm
putting
it
for
you
to
discuss...
a
procedural
obligation
under
this
kind
of
circumstance...
the
people
who
are
paying
this
judgment
did
not
intentionally
cause
harm,
the
people
who
are
paying
it.
there
is
purely
economic
harm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
fairly
small
in
amount
compared
to
the
amount
of
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
not
an
obligation
to
explain
some
rational
theory?
that
would
be
the
theory
i'm
asking
you
to
discuss.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
would
say
it
if
that's
the
law,
presumably,
and
what
i
want
to
know
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
got
the
point.
on
that
theory--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
wouldn't
a
rational
connection
be
to
take
the
total
global
amount
of
conceivable
damages
and
divide
by
the
number
of
potential
lawsuits,
and
then
you'd
have
a
number,
and
that
would
be
this
person's
rational
share
on
such
a
theory.
i'm
saying,
i
don't
know
what
that
number
would
come
to,
but
isn't
there
an
obligation,
at
least
to
articulate
the
theory?
