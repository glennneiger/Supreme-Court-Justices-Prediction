mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
a
district
court
has
the
authority
to
impose
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
minimum
only
when
the
government
files
a
motion
requesting
such
a
sentence,
so
that
when
the
government
moves
for
a
departure
from
the
guidelines
to
reflect
the
defendant's
cooperation,
but
does
not
move
for
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
minimum,
a
district
court
does
not
have
the
authority
to
impose
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
minimum.
we
think
that
result
is
compelled
by
the
text
of
18
u.s.c.
3553(e),
which
is
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
you
do
not.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
converse
is
true,
but
to
address
justice
stevens'
point,
what
the
commission
has
said
in
application
note
1
is
that
the
only
time
you
can
do
that
is
under
the
circumstances
set
forth
in
18
u.s.c.
3553
(e),
so
it
sends
you
back
to
the
statute,
and
what
you
have
to
decide
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
it
says
that,
upon
motion
of
the
government,
a
court
shall
have
the
authority
to
impose
a
sentence
below
a
level
established
by
statute
as
a
minimum
sentence
so
as
to
reflect
a
defendant's
substantial
assistance.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
do
not
think
it
could.
we
think
that
3553(e)
means
that
there
has
to
be
a
government
request
for
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
minimum.
if
there
is
not
that
kind
of
request,
the
commission
cannot
deem
it
one.
i
would
say...
i
would
distinguish
that
from
the
situation
where
the
commission
set
up
a
guideline
system
and
said
we
will
only
open
up
a
guidelines
departure
for
assistance
if
the
government
first
comes
in
and
says,
we
move
for
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
minimum,
but
the
commission
clearly
did
not
do
anything
like
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
it
didn't.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
i
would
distinguish
the
two
situations,
again,
where
the
commission--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--and
what
i
would
say
that
what
the
commission
cannot
say
is
that
a
motion
for
a
departure
from
the
guidelines
is,
ipso
facto--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--okay,
and
now--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i...
we
disagree.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
now
i'll
explain
why.
first
of
all,
just
by
using
the
term,
substantial
assistance,
the
terms
mean
the
same
thing,
but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
let
me
start
just,
that
was
part
of
what
was
similar,
and
i'll
take
one
bit
of
it
at
a
time.
just
by
using
the
term,
substantial
assistance,
that
is
a
necessary
condition,
but
not
a
sufficient
one
for
filing
a
motion
to
depart
from
the
statutory
minimum.
the
government
must
go
on
to
decide
whether,
in
light
of
that
substantial
assistance,
the
seriousness
of
the
defendant's
conduct,
the
level
of
operation,
and
a
host
of
other
factors,
whether
that
warrants
a
motion
by
the
government
to
seek
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
minimum.
now,
there
are
many
cases
in
which
the
government,
where
there
is
a
difference
between
the
guidelines
range,
which
is
significantly
above
the
statutory
minimum
because
a
defendant
may
have
a
long
criminal
history,
he
may
be
dealing
in
quantities
that
are
much
larger,
and--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--and
i'm
not
saying
there
are
two
kinds.
i'm
saying
the
same
kind
of
substantial
assistance
might
lead
the
government
to
move
only
for
a
guidelines
departure
or
only...
for
both
a
guidelines
departure
and
a
departure
from
the
statutory
minimum
in
light
of
the
serious...
if...
the
government
might,
for
example,
say,
this
conduct
is
so
serious
that
we
are
not
going
to
move...
we
are
not
going
to
seek
to
get
this
defendant's
cooperation
by
moving
for--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
on
the
statutory
minimum
sentences
the
government
is
perfectly
free
to
take
into
account
that
the
defendant
has
engaged
in
serious
conduct
and,
notwithstanding
that
he
may
be
giving
substantial
assistance,
we're
not
going
to
reward
that
substantial
assistance
for
somebody
who
has
a
16
to
20-year
guideline
sentence
with
something
that
goes
below
the
statutory
minimum.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
commission
could
do
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
we
think
the
commission
would
have
that
authority
under
994(n),
because
we
think
it
would
satisfy
the
charge
that
it
provide...
that
it's
generally...
for
the
general
appropriateness
of
departures
before
the
guidelines,
because
in--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
that
in
a
large
category
of
cases
the
government
would
be
willing
to
do
both,
so
you
are
talking
about
a
discrete
category
of
cases--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--where
the
government--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
that
it
doesn't
have
much
to
recommend
it,
and
we
wouldn't
advise
the
commission
to
do
something
like
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
difficulty
there,
justice
souter,
is
there
are...
the
difference
in
perspective
between
the
government
and
the
court.
in
many
instances,
there
is
a
difference
in
perspective,
and
the...
where
they're
going
to
reach
differing
conclusions
about
the
value
of
that
assistance.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and...
but
i...
and
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
i
think
what
that
translates
into
is
the
behavior
of
the
prosecutor
as
he
makes
the
deal.
if...
there...
if
you're
in
a
situation
where
the
prosecutor
thinks
that
by
filing
any
sort
of
motion
at
all
it's
going
to
open
up
a
departure
below
the
statutory
minimum
as
well
as
the
guidelines,
then
there
will
be
a
significant
number
of
cases
in
which
the
prosecutor
will
be
unwilling
to
make
any
deal
at
all.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
right.
apart
from
the
policy
considerations
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
yes,
3553(e)
would
certainly
preclude
the
court
from--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
no,
5k1.1
requires
a
government
motion
to
go
below
the
guidelines.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
we
read
5k1.1--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
5k1.1
simply
doesn't
leave
that
option
open.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
our
interest
is
better
protected
by
affirming
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
without
the
consent--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
994(n)
gives
the
commission
authority,
general
authority
to
decide
how
to
proceed
with
substantial--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
right,
but
i
think
beyond
that
the
commission
generally
has
authority--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
i
think
all
it
does
is
give
the
commission
the
responsibility
to
decide
how
that
should
be
done,
and
here
the
commission
decided
that
that
should
be
done
with
a
motion.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
is
not.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
is
a
study
currently
under
way
not
addressing
this
particular
problem,
but
the
commission
has
a
study
underway
studying
how
substantial
assistance
departures
have
worked
out
in
practice,
and
there
is
a
preliminary
report,
not
a
final
report,
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no,
it
does
not.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
are
four
circuits
that
have
ruled
against
us
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
actually
have
been
involved
legislatively,
but
that
is
on
hold
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
have
not
gone
to
the
commission
with
this.
i
think
what...
we
think
the
rule
is
right
now
that
there
is
a
window,
and
that
that
would
only
need
to
be
changed
if
this
court
ruled
against
us
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
right.
it's
done
at
the
plea
bargaining
stage.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
wouldn't...
i
don't
want
to
say
never.
i
think
almost
always--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--at
the
plea
bargaining
stage.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
the
consequence--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
you're
saying
that
it
requires
a
motion
to
go
below
the
statutory
minimum--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--then
the
consequence
in
this
case
is
the
court
had
no
authority,
and
then--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
our
plea
agreement
only
committed
us
to
file
a
motion
under
the
guidelines.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
which
we
did.
in
our
view
we
did.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
first
of
all,
the
question
of
the
plea
agreement
is
not
here,
because
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--petitioner
has
never
raised
an
issue
in
either
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
or
anywhere
else
that
there's
been
a
breach
of
the
plea
agreement.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
if
we
were
going
to
address
what
the
plea--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--okay.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it's
not
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
if
the
issue
were
here,
or
not?
if
the
issue
were
here,
and
we
were
deciding,
did
the
government
breach
its
plea
agreement?
the
answer
is
no,
it
didn't,
because
it
filed
the
relevant
motion.
now,
it
may
be
that
that
turned
out
to
be
worthless
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
but
that's
okay.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
government
doing
something
that's
worthless
on
some
occasions
as
long
as
that's
what
the
agreement
required
it
to
do.
and
that
would
be
the
case
under
your
hypothetical.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
don't
think
that
the
commission
does
have
that
role.
we
think
the
commission's
responsibility
is
with
respect
to
3553(e)
motions
it
comes
in
after
the
government
makes
its
motion
for
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
minimum.
it's
at
that
point
that
the
commission's
responsibility
takes
over
in
deciding
what
the
sentence
will
be
after
that.
with
respect
to
5k1.1,
yes,
the
commission
probably
has
authority
with
respect
to
the
guidelines
to
decide
what
sort
of
motion
should
be
filed.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
would
be
a
very--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
right,
because
i
think
that
the
statutory
minimum
penalties
are
so
important,
and
were
deemed
so
important
by
congress,
that
you
really
need
a
very
explicit
and
clear
statement
by
the
government
that
it
is
seeking
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
minimum.
i
think
that's
what
3553(e)
contemplates,
that
specific
judgment
that
we
think
that
this
is
not
just
substantial
assistance.
and
it's
not
just
substantial
assistance
that
warrants
a
departure
from
the
guidelines
or
a
reduced
sentence.
it
is
substantial
assistance
that,
in
our
judgment,
makes
it
appropriate
for
this
defendant
to
receive
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
minimum.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think
after
the
court
decides
this
case,
everyone
will
know.
[laughter]
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
would
object
to
including
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it's
not
a
matter
of
objecting.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
it's
a
good
idea,
but
the
question
comes
up
in
those
rare
cases
where
that
warning
wasn't
given
what
should
happen,
and
we
think
that
what
should...
happen
should
be
dictated
by
the
statute
in
that
situation.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further--
