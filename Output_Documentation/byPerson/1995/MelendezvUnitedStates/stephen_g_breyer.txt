justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
isn't
correct
as
a
statement
of
law,
is
it?
i
mean,
as
a
statement
of
law
the
commission
can't
monkey
around
at
all
with
the
statute,
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
commission's
job
is
simply
to
say
what
the
circumstances
are
under
which
you
can
depart
from
a
guideline.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
if
that's
true,
they
could
say,
i'll
tell
you
one
situation
in
which
you
can
depart
downward
from
a
guideline.
one
situation...
and
there
may
be
others,
but
one
situation
in
which
you
can
depart
downward
from
a
guideline,
99
percent
of
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
mandatory
minimum
statutes,
one
situation
is
where
the
government
makes
the
same
kind
of
motion
and
shows
the
same
kind
of
assistance
that
they'd
have
to
show
if
this
were
a
statutory
case
and
they
were
interested
in
the
statute.
that's
the
situation
in
which
you
can
depart
from
a
guideline
for
that
reason.
that
would
have
been
within
the
commission's
power.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
how
does
that
affect
your
case?
if,
as
i
read
this,
the
commission
said
just
that,
we'll
tell
you...
we'll
tell
you
when
you
can
depart
downward
from
the
guideline
on
the
question
of
substantial
assistance.
judge,
you
can
do
that
if
you
are
in
the
same
kind
of
situation
where,
if
there
were
a
mandatory
minimum,
which
most
of
the
time
there
isn't,
it
would
suffice
to
get
you
below
the
mandatory
minimum.
the
commission
might
well
have
thought
that.
now,
how
does
that
affect
your
case,
because
they're
telling
you
that
in
this
case
it
isn't
that
kind
of
situation.
that
kind
of
motion
wasn't
made,
and
i
guess
the
government
has
the
right
not
to
make
that
kind
of
motion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
didn't
do
it
right.
it's
a
motion,
according
to
them,
that
doesn't
satisfy
5k1.1,
if
5k1.1
means
what
i
think
it
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
5k1.1
says
if
you
want
to
move
under
5k1.1,
bring
a
mandatory
statutory
type
motion,
and
they're
telling
you
they
didn't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
yes
it
does.
i'm
trying...
i
mean,
i
think
it
does,
all
right.
i
think
it's
saying
you've
got
to
bring
a
mandatory,
statutory
type
motion.
i'm
trying
to
show
you
something.
if
they
didn't
bring
that
motion,
what
happens
next,
if
they're
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
never
brought
a
5k1.1.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
now
what
happens
to
your
client?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
they
make
a
promise
that
they
would
bring
such
a
motion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
didn't
they
break
that
promise
if
they
didn't
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
just...
all
right,
i'll
take
it
up
with
them,
but
i...
what
i...
i'm
not
certain
about
this
case.
if
it's
the
case
that
5k1.1
means
you
have
to
bring
a
statutory
type
motion
to
get
any
departure,
it
could
be
up
to
them
whether
they
did
or
they
didn't
do
it,
but
if
they
didn't
do
it,
aren't
they
in
violation
of
the
plea
agreement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
if
that's
the...
that's
why...
i
mean,
suppose
i
did
think
that
was
the
correct
interpretation,
how
should
i
decide
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
doesn't...
5k1.1
doesn't
say
it's
the
exclusive
way
to
get
a
downward
departure
for
substantial
assistance.
none
of
the
5k's
say
they're
exclusive,
and
the
beginning
of
the
guideline
specifically
says
at
the
beginning,
in
discussing
departures,
that
the
commission...
specifically
says
it,
that
the...
with
specific
exceptions,
and
it
doesn't
mention
5k1.1
is
one
of
them.
the
commission
does
not
intend
to
limit
the
kinds
of
factors,
whether
or
not
mentioned
anywhere
else
in
the
guidelines,
that
could
constitute
grounds
for
departure
in
an
unusual
case,
so
that
to
me
has
left
open
this
question.
but
limiting
factors
is
quite
different
from
saying
whether
or
not
there
has
to
be
a
motion.
you
agree
that
5k1.1
requires
a
motion.
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i
thought
that
what
it
could
have
said
was
this.
couldn't
it
have
said
the
following?
there
is
a
thing,
a
certain
animal.
we'll
call
this
animal
what
happens
when
you
want
to
go
below
a
statute.
the
animal
has
two
parts.
the
government
makes
a
motion,
and
the
government
says,
a
special
assistance,
and
there's
a
statute
that
describes
in
words
just
what
that
is.
doesn't
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
say,
we
will
tell
you
when
you
can
depart
from
a
guideline,
you
can
depart
from
a
guideline
when
you
have
the
statutory
animal?
doesn't
it
have
the
authority
to
tell
people
when
it
can
depart
downward
for
substantial
assistance,
and
doesn't
it
have
the
authority
to
choose
that
those
times
are
when
you
have
the
kind
of
animal
that
would
allow
you
to
depart
from
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that
they're
different.
i
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
you're
right.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
but
then
the
question
becomes,
did
it
choose
to
allow
the
departure
from
the
guidelines
only
where,
under
5k1.1,
there
is
the
statutory
animal?
the
evidence
that
they
give
is
that
they
used
almost
identical
words.
the
words
of
5k1.1
are
identical
to
the
statute,
almost,
with
irrelevant
differences.
the
second
piece
of
evidence
is
the
note
you
cited
refers
to
circumstances
set
forth
both
in
3553(e),
which
is
the
statute,
and
994(n),
which
is
the
guideline,
so
there
are
two
pieces
of
evidence
that
they
meant
the
same
animal,
and
i
see
no
evidence
that
they
didn't
mean
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know
that,
but
i'm
looking
for
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
it's
more
words
than
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
indication...
i
mean,
there
are
circuits,
most
of
them,
perhaps,
or
some
of
them
that
just
have
the
one
motion
rule,
the
second
circuit,
i
think,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
has
there
turned
out
to
be
a
problem,
a
practical
problem
that's
led
you
perhaps
to
think
of
asking
the
commission
to
create
a
kind
of
substantial
assistance
light,
a
5k1.1
light,
if
you
were
to...
you
know,
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--has
the
commission
considered
it
at...
i
mean,
you
could...
there's
nothing...
it's
not
illogical
to
have
a
5k1.1
light.
i
mean,
it
is...
that's
maybe
a
good
thing
to
do,
but
is
there
anything
we
can
look
at
where
you...
that's
public?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
finished,
i
do
have
a...
suppose
i
did
think...
i
mean,
i
put
these
questions
more
forcefully,
often,
than
i...
when
i'm
accually
uncertain,
but
if
it
turned
out
that
i
did
think
that
the
5k1.1
is
meant
to
pick
up
the
statutory
animal,
you
know,
what
i've
been
saying,
still,
it
would
be
up
to
the
government
to
say
what
kind
of
motion
they've
made.
so
how
would...
what
would
be
the
outcome
in
this
case?
you
see,
i
mean,
it's...
you're
absolutely
right
that
the
commission
can't
control--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
we
would
affirm,
but
then
you
might
be
in
violation
of
the
plea
agreement.
is
that
how
it
would
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is,
if
you
took
the
view,
if
it
turned
out
that
5k1.1
is
meant
to
say
you
have
to
have
a
certain
animal,
and
that
is
the
statutory
animal,
and
you
tell
us
you
don't
have
that
animal
therefore
you
don't
have
the
5k1.1
animal,
if
that's
what
we
thought,
if
that's
what
i
thought,
i
can't
figure
out
how
this
case
should
come
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
address
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
to
know,
how
would
we
decide--
--no,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
in
your
opinion--
--we
should...
how
should
i
decide
this?
