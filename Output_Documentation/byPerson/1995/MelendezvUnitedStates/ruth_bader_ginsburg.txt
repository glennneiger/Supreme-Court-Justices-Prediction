justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
mullin,
what
is
the
clearest
indication
that
that
is
indeed
what
the
commission
meant,
because
i
found
that
there
was
at
least
some
ambiguity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mullin,
suppose
the
commission
should
say,
we
understand
there's
some
confusion
about
this
downward
departure
for
cooperation,
so
now
we're
going
to
speak
clearly,
and
we're
going
to
say
the
discretion
is
with
the
prosecutor,
1)
to
go
below
the
guidelines,
2)
to
go
below
the
mandatory
minimum.
the
discretion
is
not
with
the
judge.
the
judge
cannot
act
unless...
cannot
go
below
the
guidelines
unless
there
is
a
motion
to
that
effect,
cannot
go
below
the
mandatory
minimum
unless
there's
a
request
to
that
effect,
so
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
one
motion
or
two,
but
who
has
the
discretion.
if
the
sentencing
commission
made
it
clear
that
it
thought
it
had...
the
prosecutor
had
the
discretion
on
both
questions,
do
you
have
any
case
left?
are
you
making
a
statutory
argument
independent
of
the
commission's
authority?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
numbering
the
motions.
motions
doesn't
matter.
who
has
the
discretion
if
the
sentencing
commission
said,
we
think
the
prosecutor
and
not
the
judge
has
the
discretion
to
initiate
a
departure
from
the
guidelines,
and/or
a
departure
from
the
mandatory
minimum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
essentially,
then,
you're
arguing
that
we
have
an
ambiguous
statutory
scheme,
the
sentencing
commission
could
go
either
way
on
it,
whatever
way
it
goes
the
court
should
follow?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i...
one
question
i
had
about
the
current
status
of
the
sentencing
commission's
thinking
on
this
subject,
is
there
not
ongoing
some
kind
of
review
within
the
commission
of
substantial
cooperation
departures?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't
touch
this
problem
at
all.
