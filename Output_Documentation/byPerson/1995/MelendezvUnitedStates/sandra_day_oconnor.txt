well,
counsel,
do
you
agree
that
the
commission
certainly
could
have
set
up
an
implementation
of
the
statutes
that
would
have
set
up
this
kind
of
two-tier
approach
that
the
government
urges?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
simply
say
to
us
that
that
isn't
how
the
commission
implemented
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
set
up
instead
a
one-tier--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
section
994(n)
doesn't
refer
by
number
to
3553(e),
i
take
it,
but
it
does
say
the
commission
shall
ensure
that
the
guidelines
reflect
the
general
appropriateness
of
imposing
a
lower
sentence,
including
a
sentence
that's
lower
than
established
by
statute
as
a
minimum
sentence,
to
take
account
of
a
defendant's
substantial
assistance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
the
commission
expressly
adopt
a
rule
that
says,
we
will
deem
a
government
motion
asking
the
court
to
consider
the
defendant's
substantial
assistance
to
be
a
motion
that
satisfies
3553(e)
as
well
as
any
guideline?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
didn't?
