justice
john
paul
stevens
he
does
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
read
it
as
being
exclusive,
just
the
opposite
of
what
justice
breyer
said.
it's
a
very
good
question.
it's
never
been
answered
as
to
the
extent
to
which,
in
a
very,
very,
very
unusual
case
a
judge
might
depart
for
substantial
assistance
outside
the
framework
of
5k1.1,
so
i
take
it
that's
never
been
answered,
and
i
don't
know
that
we'd
have
to
answer
it
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
term
guidelines
itself
embraces
both
the
broader
category
and
the
subcategory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
converse
is
what's
the
subcategory...
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt...
may
i,
just
with
this
one
thought,
concentrating
on
the
words,
substantial
assistance,
you
are
in
effect
arguing
there
are
two
kinds
of
substantial
assistance,
one
that
justifies
a
departure
from
the
statute,
and
the
other
just
justifies
a
guideline
departure,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
text
of
either
document
that
describes
two
kinds
of
substantial
assistance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the...
well,
let
me
just
interrupt
you.
the
seriousness
of
the
defendant's
conduct,
it
seems
to
me,
has
already
been
evaluated
in
the
guidelines,
and
the
general
purpose
here
is
to
say,
to
what
extent
shall
we
go
below
what
would
normally
be
the
correct
evaluation
of
the
seriousness
of
the
conduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
there
a
possible
answer
to
that,
and
that's
why
both
justices...
i
don't
know
if
this
why
justice
kennedy
asked
the
question,
but
his
question
raises
this.
supposing
you
lost
the
case,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
you
will,
would
it
not
thereafter
still
be
possible
for
you
to
say
in
a
plea
bargain,
we're
not
going
to
make
any
motions,
but
if...
but
we
will
agree
to
tell
the
judge
that
you
had
done
the
following
cooperative
things,
and
then
the
defendant
could
ask
the
judge
for
a
departure
saying,
i've
given
substantial
assistance,
and
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
would
prevent
the
judge
from
going
ahead
and
taking
that
into
account
without
any
motion
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
couldn't
go
below
the
minimum--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
no,
but
he
could
go
below
the
guidelines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true--
--well,
it
says
he
may
do.
it
doesn't
say
it
must
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
read
that
as
disabling
that
possible
solution
which
would
protect
your
interest
and
keep
the
scheme
alive
that
you're
arguing
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gornstein--
--i
have
a
feeling
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
who
wins
this
case.
what
is
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
limit
the
power
of
the
district
judge
to
depart
under
the
guidelines
downward
based
on
an
encouraged
factor
without
the
motion...
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
how
you
would
deal
with
the
following
motion:
motion
of
the
government
for
a
sentence
which
will
appropriately
reflect
the
defendant's
substantial
assistance
with
the
government--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
attach...
yes,
but
supposing
that
was
the
way
it
was
phrased,
would
the
judge
have
any
authority
or
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
go
below...
you
think
not.
