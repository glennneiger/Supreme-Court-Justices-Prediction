chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-5661,
juan
melendez
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
mullin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
agreed,
is
it
not,
mr.
mullin,
that
the
government's
motion
was
not
filed
under
section
3553(e)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
question
presented,
and
i
believe
it
was
presented
in
your
petition,
is...
let
me
get
the
petition.
it's,
once
the
prosecutor
moves
for
a
sentencing
departure
in
recognition
of
a
defendant's
substantial
assistance
to
law
enforcement,
does
a
federal
court
have
authority
to
impose
a
sentence
beneath
both
the
guideline
range
and
a
minimum
term
set
by
statute,
even
when
the
government
does
not
seek
the
latter
degree
of
departure?
you
say,
then,
the
government
did
move
under
section
3553(e)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
the
government...
at
least
the
government's
motion
by
its
terms
was
not
made
pursuant
to
3553(e),
you
agree
with--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--whereabouts
is
that
found,
mr.
mullin?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
and
would
you
tell
us
again
what
you're
quoting
from
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
quite
consistent
with
3553(e),
isn't
it,
that
the
commission
was
to
have
a
role
in
both
of
those
kinds
of
departures?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
certainly
should
have.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
we
now...
2d1,
are
we
talking
about
something
that
you
did
manage
to
put
in
your
appendix,
or
is
that
the
one
that
you
left
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
3553(e)
is
titled,
limited
authority
to
impose
a
sentence
below
a
statutory
minimum,
suggesting
that
that
may
be
the
only
source
of
authority
to
impose
a
sentence
below
the
mandatory
minimum
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
didn't
raise
any
question
like
that
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
did
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
gather
the
court
of
appeals
had
some
doubt
as
to
whether
it...
the
commission
could
have
gone
either
way
on
this
question.
i
think
they
expressed
the
view
that
very
likely,
even
if
the
commission
had
wanted
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
set
up
a
single
track
system,
they
thought
it
might
lack
that
power
under
35...
whatever
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
53(e).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mullin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
couldn't
you--
--your
argument
at
any
rate
is
that
congress
left
that
to
the
prosecutor
and
not
to
the
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
mullin,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mullin.
the
case
is
submitted.
