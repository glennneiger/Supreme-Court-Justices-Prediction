justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
reply
brief,
or
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
994(n)
not
refer
to
3553?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
your
point
about
the
guidelines
is.
the
statute
itself
requires
a
government
motion,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
are
you
saying
that
the
guidelines
could
dispense
with
the
necessity
for
a
government
motion
despite
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
you
need
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
what
do
the
guidelines
achieve?
can
the
guidelines
say
that
even
where
there
is
not
such
a
motion
we
will
deem
such
a
motion
to
exist?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
what
is
it
that
you
claim
the
guidelines
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
that
the
guidelines
have
the
power
to
say
that
a
motion
to
move
downward
in
the
guidelines,
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
is,
ipso
facto,
a
motion
under
3553.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
kennedy
doesn't
think
that--
--i...
could
i
ask
you
this
hypothetical
case?
supposing
in
the
plea
agreement
the
government
says,
we
will
not
make
such
a
motion,
but
we
do
agree
that
if
you
call
these
following
facts
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
we
will
confirm
their
accuracy,
we
will
acknowledge
that
these
are
true,
and
there's
no
motion.
they
then
go
to
the
judge
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
say,
and
the
defendant
asks
for
a
downward
departure
on
the
basis
of
substantial
cooperation
and
says,
these
facts
are
sufficient
to
establish
what
we
think
is
going
to
justify
a
lower
sentence.
would
the
judge
have
the
authority
to
impose
a
lower
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mullin,
you're
not
relying
on
any
language
in
the
operative
portion
of
5k1.1.
you're
just
relying
on
the
application
note,
which
simply
notes
that
under
circumstances
set
forth
in
3553
and
994,
substantial
assistance
would
justify
a
sentence
below
the
statutory
required
minimum,
but
the
text
of
5k1.1
simply
says,
upon
motion
of
the
government,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
the
court
may
depart
from
the
guidelines.
that's
all
that
the
operative
provision
says
it
may
depart
from.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
nothing
that
limits
it,
but
nothing
that
approves
departure
from
something
else,
either.
it
approves
a
departure
from
the
guidelines
upon
motion.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
as
a
reminder,
it's
set
forth
in
the
application
note.
under
circumstances
set
forth
in
3553,
circumstances
which
include
a
motion
by
the
government,
substantial
assistance
may
justify
a
sentence
below
a
statutory
required
minimum.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
it's
just
as
authoritative,
but
the
question
that
we're
discussing
here
is
whether
the
operative
portion
of
5k1.1
was
meant
to
establish
a
one-tier
system,
as
you
call
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
make
one
motion
do
the
work
of
two,
and
for
that
purpose,
whatever
the
application
notes
say,
it
seems
to
me
you
look
to
the
text
of
it,
and
that
text
does
not
suggest
that
it's
a
two-tier
system.
it
just
says,
upon
motion
the
court
may
depart
from
the
guidelines.
it
could
have
said,
from
the
guidelines
and
from
any
applicable
statutory
minimum,
but
that's
not
what
it
said.
how
could
it
have
said
the
latter,
since
the
commission
has
no
authority
whatsoever
to
govern
the
statutory
part.
well,
and
also,
aren't...
departures
from
the
mandatory
minimum
are
a
subcategory
of
departures
from
the
guidelines.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
one
a
subgroup
of
the
other?
is
every
departure
from
the
guidelines...
when
you
approve
a
departure
from
the
guidelines
do
you
automatically
approve
a
departure
from
the
statutory
minimum?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gornstein,
i
was
surprised
to
hear
you
agree
with
justice
breyer
that
the
commission
could
establish
a
rule,
we
will
allow
no
departure
below
the
guidelines
unless
there
is
also
a
departure
below
the
minimum.
isn't...
you
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
commission
could
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
in
accordance
with
the
requirement
of
section
994(n)
that
it
assure...
assure...
that
the
guidelines
reflect
the
general
appropriateness
of
imposing
a
lower
sentence
than
would
otherwise
be
imposed,
including
a
sentence
that
is...
including
a
sentence
that
is
lower...
to
take
into
account
a
defendant's
substantial
assistance.
i
would
think
to
say
arbitrarily,
well,
unless
the
government
is
willing
to
go
below
the
minimum,
we're
not
going
to
reduce
this...
allow
the
sentence
to
be
reduced
at
all,
even
within
the
guidelines,
above
the
minimum.
i
don't
think
that
would
comply
with
(n).
justice
antonin
scalia
what
relevance
does
the
government's
unwillingness
to
go
below
the
minimum
have
to
do
with
the
appropriateness
of
reducing
it
within
the
guidelines
above
the
minimum?
i
can't...
i
just
don't
see
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
know
that,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
no
justification
for
treating
them
irrationally.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
wouldn't
advise
you
to
accept
the
proposition,
because
number
1,
it
hurts
your
case,
and
number
2,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
there
in
the
statute.
mr.
gornstein,
you
argued
a
moment
ago
that
because
of
the
seriousness
of
the
conduct,
the
government
might
very
well
say,
well,
we'll
go
below
the
guideline
but
not
below
the
minimum,
and
you
say
we
shouldn't
be
placed
in
a
position
in
which
we're
forced
to
do
that.
but
your
argument
seems
to
assume
that
if
there
is,
we'll
say,
a
one-motion
procedure
and
if
you
speak
the
magic
words,
substantial
assistance,
in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound,
that's
not
true.
i
mean,
the
government,
on
that
assumption,
does
not
have
to
stand
moot
after
its
motion
is
filed.
the
government
can
come
in
and
say,
look,
judge,
don't
go
below
the
statutory
minimum.
the
reason
you
shouldn't
go
below
the
statutory
minimum
is,
the
conduct
is
this
serious,
for
reasons
a,
b,
and
c,
and
the
second
reason
is,
that
isn't
the
deal
we
made.
the
deal
we
made
with
this
guy
was
that
we
would
file
the
motion,
and
we
would
then
come
in
and
say
just
what
i'm
saying.
go
below
the
guideline,
but
don't
go
below
the
statutory
minimum.
