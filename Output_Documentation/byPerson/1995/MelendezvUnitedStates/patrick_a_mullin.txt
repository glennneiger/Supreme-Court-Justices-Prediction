mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
government
made
a
motion
which
asked
the
district
court
for
a
sentence
that
reflected
the
petitioner's
substantial
assistance.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
that
government
motion
was
sufficient
to
permit
a
sentence
which
both
departed
from
the
guidelines
and
was
also
below
a
statutory
minimum.
petitioner
submits
that
the
government's
motion
was
sufficient,
and
bases
his
position
on
the
language
in
the
pertinent
statutory
and
sentencing
guidelines
provisions.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that...
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
the
motion
that
was
filed
by
the
government
was
brought
under
section
5k1.1,
but
it
encompassed
the
requirements
under
section
3553(e)
that
permitted--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--oh,
no,
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
they
brought...
that
they
specific...
they
specify
their
application
as
being
under
section
3553(e),
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court
had
authority
to--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--oh,
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
their
motion
was
brought
by
letter,
i
would
note,
but
was
accepted
as
a
form
of
notice
of
motion
by
both
parties
as
specifying
that
a
motion
was
being
brought
under
section
5k1.1
of
the
guidelines.
it
is
our
position
that
that
motion
permitted
judge
sarokin
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
to
depart
not
only
from
the
applicable
guideline
range,
which
in
that
case
was
135
to
168
months,
but
also
below
the
10-year
statutory
minimum
that
was
in
place
in
that
case,
or
in
this
case.
the
three
provisions
enacted
in
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1986
establish
a
regime
to
reward
substantial
assistance
by
defendants.
section
3553(e)
imposes
a
government
motion
requirement
for
sentences
below
statutory
minimums.
in
section
994(n),
congress
directed
the
sentencing
commission
to,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
statute
now,
which...
it
is
found
at
the
appendix
al...
assure
that
the
guidelines
reflect
the
general
appropriateness
of
imposing
a
sentence
lower
than
would
otherwise
be
imposed.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice,
in
my
brief,
my
first
brief
to
the
court.
in
a1
i
specifically
cite,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
statute.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
moving
down
to
the
first
line,
congress
directed...
let
me
state
the
language.
assure
that
the
guidelines
reflect
the
general
appropriateness
of
imposing
a
sentence
lower
than
would
otherwise
be
imposed...
and
this
is
the
key
language...
including
a
sentence
that
is
lower
than
that
established
by
statute
as
a
minimum
sentence.
and
it's
petitioner's
position
that
the
congress
directed
the
commission
to
establish
a
regime
to
regulate
the
substantial
assistance
motions
to
include,
and
as
it
states
here,
not
only
departures
from
the
applicable
guideline
range
but
also
departures
below
mandatory
minimums.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
second
sentence
of
3553(e),
and
again
i
have
that
on
al
of
my
brief--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--justice
o'connor,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that
is
correct,
yes.
that's
what
the
commission
did.
the
commission
took
the
motion
requirement
under
section
3553(e)
together
with
its
directives
under
994(n)
and
created
a
one
motion,
or
a
single
motion
approach,
and
required
that
once
the
government
brings
a
single
motion,
then
the
court
has
the
authority
to
depart
not
only
from
the
applicable
guideline
range,
but
also
below
statutory
minimums,
and
this
can
be
found
not
only
in
section
5k1.1,
but
also
in
the
commentary
to
section
5k1.1
and
other
commentary
found
throughout
the
guidelines.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
the
clearest
indication
i
would
state,
justice
ginsburg,
is
found
in
note
7
to
section
2d1.1.
section
2d1
1...
and
i
apologize
to
the
court.
i
failed
to
put
it
in
my
appendix.
i
really
should
have.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
failing
to
do
that,
but
section
2d1.1
deals
with
drug
cases.
most
of
the
cases
that
involve
mandatory
minimums
that
come
before
the
federal
courts--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--chief
justice,
i
didn't
put
it
in
my
appendix.
i
did
note
it
in
the
relevant
language
in
my
reply
brief,
on
page...
well,
it's
noted
in...
on
page
30
of
my
brief,
so
it
is
in
there.
i'm
sorry.
it's
not
in
my
appendix,
but
it
is
in
page
30.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
of
my
original
brief.
in
note
7,
as
i
was
stating,
section
2d1.1
deals
with
drug
cases.
most
of
the
mandatory
minimum
cases
at
the
federal
courts
entertained
are
drug
cases.
that's
the
reality
of
it,
and
note
7
deals
with
this
issue
of
departure
below
mandatory
minimums,
and
the
language
i
think
is
very
instructive
as
to
what
it
says
and
what
it
doesn't
say.
note
7
says
that
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
applies,
this
mandatory
minimum
sentence
may
be
28
u.s.c.
section
994,
by
reason
of
a
defendant's
substantial
assistance
in
the
investigation
and
prosecution
of
another
person
who
has
committed
an
offense.
and
then
it
cites
section
5k1.1
for
that
proposition.
nowhere
in
this
note
is
there
any
reference
to
section
3553(e).
if
the
commission
were
looking
to
create
a
two-track
system,
or
if
the
commission
were
looking
to
not
get
involved
in
departures
below
mandatory
minimums,
and
to
basically
not
accept
the
authority
that
is
given
to
them
by
the
congress,
they
would
not
have
put
that
in
there,
section
3553,
and
they
did
not.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
i
don't
believe
it
does,
judge.
justice,
i'm
sorry.
justice.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
yes.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
well,
it
was...
yes.
it
was
passed
as
the
exception
to
the
otherwise
rule
that
a
court
can't
depart,
or
can't
sentence
below
mandatory
minimums,
so
it
does
create
the
authority
for
that.
but
what
it
requires
is
a
government
motion
based
upon
a
defendant's
substantial
assistance.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
absolutely
not.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
no,
they
cannot,
justice
scalia.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
what
the
guidelines
do
is
require
that
the
government
bring
a
motion
based
upon
a
defendant's
substantial
assistance,
and
that
is
what
section
3553(e)
requires,
before
there
can
be
departure
below
a
mandatory
minimum,
and
it's
the
petitioner's
position
that
under
section
5k1.1
the
commission
devised
a
scheme
where
only
one
motion
has
to
be
brought
for
a
departure
both
from
the
applicable
guideline
range
as
well
as
below
statutory
minimums,
so
there
is
the
motion
requirement
met
under
section
3553.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that's
correct.
it
envelops--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
well,
the
government
here
brought
a
motion
under
section
5k1.1.
once--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--well,
section
5k1.1,
as
i--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--as
i
read
section
5k1.1,
it
doesn't
require
that,
though,
justice--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--well,
if
there's
no...
if
there's--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--if
they
never
brought
the
5k1.1--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--then
the
court
has
no
authority
to
depart.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
yes.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
at
that
point
he
has,
at
best,
under
this
scenario,
a
135-month
sentence.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
because
that's
the
bottom
of
the--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--they
had...
they
said
they
would
bring
a
motion
if
there
was
substantial
assistance.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
well,
that
gets
into
the
wade
case,
and
what
this
court
decided
in
wade.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
well,
they're...
to
the
extent
that
the
government
agreed
in
the
plea
agreement
here
to
bring
a
motion
for
departure
under
section
5k1.1,
and
didn't
state,
as
they
didn't
in
this
plea
agreement,
that
they
would
seek
a
cap
on
the
reduction,
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
they
certainly
are
either
in
violation
of
the
agreement
or
in
effect
may
have
waived
their
right
to
argue.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
i
did
not.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
well,
the
government
moves...
its
position
is
that
section
3553(e)
motion
is
necessary.
the
third
circuit
found
it
that
way,
so
i
think
what...
this
court
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
determining
whether
an
application
under
section
5k1.1
involves
departures
from
the
guideline
range
and
from
mandatory
minimums.
and
it
is
our
position
that
once
that
motion
is
brought,
the
sentencing
court
has
the
authority
to
depart
not
only
from
the
guideline
range
but
also
below
any
statutory
minimum
that
may
be
in
effect.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
absolutely
not.
section
5k1--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--under
section
994(n),
congress
directed
the
commission
to
avouch
that
to
create
a
scheme
for
dealing
with
rewarding
substantial
assistance,
and
congress
came
up
with,
or
the
commission
came
up
with
this
scheme
for
departure.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
994(n)
does
not.
994(n)
is
silent
as
to
the
mechanism
in
which
the
commission
can
establish
the
scheme.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
yes.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
yes,
it
does.
that's
the
way
the
commission
devised
the--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--yes.
5k1.1
as
drafted
requires
a
motion.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
no.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
under
section
5k1.1
there
has
to
be
a
government
motion.
without
the
motion,
the
court
doesn't
have
the--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
has
addressed--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--that
issue,
no.
so
it's
the
petitioner's
position
that
in
section
994(n)
congress
directed
the
commission
to
establish
a
framework
for
departures
from
the
guideline
range
and
from
mandatory
minimums,
and
that
section
5k1.1
in
fact
did
it.
a
motion
was
brought
here
under
section
5k1.1
for
departure,
and
it's
our
position
judge
sarokin
had
the
authority
to
depart
below
the
mandatory
minimum
range.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
is
your
honor's
question...
if
i
can
rephrase
it,
is
your
honor's
question
if
the
commission
decided
to
establish
a
two-track
system
for
a
motion,
one
motion
from
the
guidelines
and
a
second
motion
below?
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
under
those
circumstances,
then
we
would
have
a
different
case
than
we
have
now.
it
would
be...
whatever...
whether
it's
5k--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--yes,
i
don't
know
if
it
was...
i
don't
know
if
ambiguous
is
the
right
term,
but
the
congress
said
to
the
commission,
here's
what
we
want
you
to
do,
do
it,
and
what
the
commission
did
under
5k1.1
was
to
establish
a
scheme,
and
it
was
a
single
motion
scheme
that
they
set
up
to
deal
with
departures
for
substantial
assistance.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
53(e).
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
they
raised
some
question
about
it,
but
then
they
focused
on
what
the
commission
actually
did.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
justice
scalia,
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
the
operative
language,
departure
from
the
guidelines.
there
is
nothing
in
that
section
which
limits
where
the
departure
can
take
place,
and
5k1.1--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--that
is
correct,
but
bear
in
mind--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--but
please
bear
in
mind
that
policy
statements
under
section
1b1.7
of
the
guidelines
had
the
same
effect
has
the
commentary,
so
when
i
cite
to
the
commentary,
it
has
the
same
impact
as
the
policy
statement
here
does,
and
it's--
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
--yes.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
that
is
correct,
and
section
5g1.1
is
a
perfect
example.
where
you
have
a
guideline
sentence
below
the
mandatory
minimum
under
section
5g1.1
the
guideline
sentence
becomes
the
minimum,
so
they
are
used
in...
it
is
a
subcategory,
and
i
agree
with
your
honor.
i
would
ask
that
i
be
permitted
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
thank
you.
mr.
patrick
a.
mullin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
know
i
have
a
couple
of
minutes.
i
just
want
to
address
a
point
raised
by
justice
breyer.
i
believe
that
your
honor
was
questioning
the
solicitor
general
about
statistical
evidence
showing
the
effect
of
the
departures
under
section
5k1.1
not
only
below
the
guidelines
but
also
below
mandatory
minimums.
i
believe
the
annual
report
of
the
commission,
the
sentencing
commission,
reflects
those
statistics,
and
if
this
court
wishes
i
can
certainly
produce
an
additional
submission
to
that
effect.
i
would
note,
and
again
it's
not
in
my
papers,
but
of
the
research
that
i've
done
in
a
couple
of
the
circuits,
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
that
have
ruled
in
favor
of
petitioner,
the
number
of
departure...
number
of
departure
applications
by
the
government
has
gone
up,
and
has
gone
up
significantly
since
those
decisions
were
made.
but
again,
if
the
court
wishes
for
me
to
provide
that
information,
i'd
be
delighted
to
do
it
in
each
one
of
the
circuits
where
this
decision
was
made
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
otherwise,
i'll
simply
rely
upon
my
briefs
and
on
the
arguments
that
i
submitted
before
this
court
today,
and
ask
that
you
rule
in
favor
of
mr.
melendez.
thank
you.
