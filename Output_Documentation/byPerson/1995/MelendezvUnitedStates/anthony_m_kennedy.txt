justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
a
question
that
i
don't
think
will
bear
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
but
i
think
it's
a
necessary
predicate
for
understanding
the
scheme
here.
suppose
that
the
court
in
a
guidelines
case
where
there's
no
mandatory
minimum
imposed
by
statute,
it's
just
a
question
of
departing
from
the
guidelines
or
not,
suppose
the
court
said,
i
think
this
defendant
has
cooperated
with
the
government,
and
the
government
said,
well,
your
honor,
we're
not
making
a
motion
for
downward
departure,
and
the
court
said,
i
disagree
with
that,
he
has
cooperated
with
the
government,
can
the
court
depart
downward
absent
the
motion
from
the
government
in
a
guidelines
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
does
the
commission
get
the
authority
to
tell
the
court
that
the
court
cannot
depart
downward
in
such
an
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
think
994(n),
you
concede
that
994(n)
authorizes
the
commission
to
require
a
government
motion
before
there
can
be
a
downward
departure
under
the
guidelines
for
cooperation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
it
says
is
that
the
commission
shall
ensure
the
guidelines
reflect
the
general
appropriateness
of
imposing
a
lower
standard
to
take
into
account
a
defendant's
substantial
assistance.
i
don't
know
where
that
gives
authority
for
the
executive
to
be
involved
in
the
judicial
function
of
sentencing.
now,
i
recognize
that
this
is
true
under
the
statute,
because
the
statute
requires
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
you
can
say,
well,
the
commission
is
simply
borrowing
from
the
statute
to
assume
that
the
justice
department
has
a
sufficient
interest
here
that
there
can
be
no
departure
absent
its
motion,
but
i
seriously
question
whether
or
not
the
judge
is
prohibited
from
downward
departure
absent
the
government's
motion
in
a
guidelines
case.
well,
i
would
think
perhaps
that
5k1
that
you
were
just
quoting,
that
requires
a
government
motion,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states,
in
a
guidelines
case.
i
understand
about
the
mandatory
minimum.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
it
just
says
it
should
provide
assurance,
i
think
is
what
it
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
assure
that
the
guidelines
reflect
the
general
appropriateness.
i
don't
find
in
there
a
veto
power
given
to
the
united
states
attorney
on
a
downward
departure
under
the
guidelines.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
there
be
a
veto
power
in
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
find
that
under
the
statute.
mr.
gornstein,
my
understanding
that
those
instructions
are
what
the
u.s.
attorney...
the
u.s.
attorneys
all
over
the
country
are
telling
district
judges
you
do
not
have
authority
for
any
downward
departure
for
substantial
cooperation
unless
we
ask
you
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--could
you
tell
me,
counsel,
are
there
many
cases
in
which
this
undertaking,
this
promise
by
the
government
to
move
downward,
either
under
the
guidelines
or
the
sentence,
is
made
in
the
field
during
part
of
the
investigation,
or
is
this
usually
just
done
with
a
plea
bargain
after
the
defendant
has
counsel,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
never
in
the
field
in
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--almost
always.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
office
of
the
commission
to
issue
a
policy
statement
helping
courts
interpret
what
motions
are,
that
there's
a
presumption
that
if
you
make
the
motion
without
distinguishing
between
the
two
that
it
means
both
guidelines
and
statutes,
but
that
you
still
have
the
option
to
be
more
specific?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
justice
department
ought
to
have
sort
of
a
miranda
warning
in
its
plea
agreements:
"watch
out,
there
are
two
kinds
of
departures?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
object
to
having
a
miranda
warning
in
every
plea
agreement
just
in
case
someone
doesn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
would
you
object
to
informing
the
defendant
of
the
fact
that
he
may
be
trapped
by
your
plea
agreement?
