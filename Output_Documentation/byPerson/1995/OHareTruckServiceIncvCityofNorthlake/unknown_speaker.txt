unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
there
are
bribery
and
corruption
laws
that
would
reach
a
situation
of
quid
pro
quo,
if
you
give
me
or
you
give
my
party
$200
i
will
give
you
a
contract.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
elrod
and
subsequent
cases,
and
rutan,
in
order
to
enforce
that
kind
of
prohibition.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
that...
that
those
statutes
apply
here.
i'm
just
saying,
where
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo.
i'm
not
sure
that
was
established
as
the
factual
situation
here.
unknown
speaker
bribery
laws
aren't
dependent
on
the
first
amendment.
i
mean,
you
know,
they
apply
whether
you're
saying
give
me
$50
for
my
own
coffer
or
give
me
$50
for
the
party.
i
don't
think
those
bribery
and
corruption
laws
have
any
relationship
to
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
his
corollary
would
be,
i
was
asked
for
a
bribe,
and
i
was...
my
contract
was
terminated
because
i
refused
to
pay
a
bribe.
the
corollary
would
not
be,
i
have
a
cause
of
action
because
you
violated
my
first
amendment
rights.
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
not
relying
on
the
corruption
statutes,
you're
relying
on
the
rutan-elrod
line
of
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
grossman,
in
protecting,
for
example,
the
free
speech
rights
of
public
employees,
the
court
has
employed
some
kind
of
a
balancing
test,
the
so-called
pickering
approach,
and
has
recognized
interests
of
the
employer
as
well
as
those
of
the
employees.
do
you
think
that
the
independent
contractor
has
rights
greater
than
that
of
an
employee?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
propose
to
us,
at
least,
the
employment
of
a
stricter
level
of
scrutiny
for
the...
your
client,
the
independent
contractor,
than
would
be
the
case
for
an
employee?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
a
real
concern,
isn't
there,
for
opening
up
a
great
deal
of
litigation
in
the
government
contracting
field
if
we
find
such
a
strong
interest
on
the
part
of
the
independent
contractor?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
a
new
administration
in
northlake
comes
to
power,
and
they're
trying
to
put
together
a
list
of
their
own
as
to
who's
going
to
get
the
tow
truck
business,
is
it
in
your
view
a
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
if
they
were
to
just
put
on
that
list
that
they're
compiling
for
the
first
time
a
list
of
people
who
contributed
to
their
campaign?
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
to
remove
someone
from
a
list
that
already
exists
to
come
into
your
purview?
unknown
speaker
what
more
facts
would
you
have
needed
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical?
what
about
the
additional
fact
that
it
is
established
that
the
reason
only
these
people
were
included
was
these
were
the
only
people
that
gave
money
to
the
party?
unknown
speaker
no
termination.
it's
a
new--
unknown
speaker
--so
it
is
only
termination.
why
do
you
draw
the
line
there?
if
you're
going
to
draw
the
line
xx,
why
not
draw
the
line
at
independent
contractors?
unknown
speaker
mr.
grossman--
--i
thought
that
your
principle
was,
look
if
there
was
actual
harm
that
my
client
has
suffered
by
reason
of
his
first
amendment
beliefs.
now,
one
kind
of
harm
is
being
terminated
from
a
contract.
another
kind
of
harm
is
not
getting
a
contract
that
you
would
otherwise
get.
unknown
speaker
harm
is
harm.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
it's
not
the
case,
but
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
gobble
up
that
case.
what
about
a
failure...
you
know,
when--
unknown
speaker
--there
are
visiting
dignitaries
that
come
to
town,
the
white
house
has
dinners
for
them,
and
it
is
not
uncommon
for
significant
donors
to
the
party
that
occupies
the
white
house
to
be
invited
to
those
dinners
and
not
donors
to
the
other
party.
now,
what
about
that?
this...
i'm
sure
this
comes
out
of
public
funds
from
somewhere.
is
there
something
wicked
about
that?
is
that
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
shorting
these
people.
they
would
like
to
get
to
the
white
house
as
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
doesn't
the
mayor
of
northlake
have
the
same
identity?
unknown
speaker
so
if
he
brought
new
contributors
in
and
gave
them
benefits,
that
would
not
be
bad
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
what
is...
where
i'm
having
trouble,
and
i'm
simply
asking
for
help,
is,
forget
your
case.
if
your
case
were
here
alone
and
you
could
decide
it
separately,
i
think
you,
in
my
view,
might
well
win.
but
what's
bothering
me
about
it
is
it's
connected
to
all
kinds
of
other
cases
involving
government
contractors,
and
at
this
point
i
don't
know
how
to
draw
a
line.
that
is,
what's
bothering
me
about
the
line,
and
i
really
don't
know,
is,
it
is
not
the
case...
i
mean,
there
are
important
government
interests
in
not
getting
the
courts
too
involved
in
this.
all
50
states
have
responsible
bidding
laws
of
some
kind.
illinois,
the
word
responsible
low
bidder
appears
135
times
in
the
statutes,
so
by
and
large
they've
statutorily
taken
care
of
the
problem
except
in
certain
instances
like
yours,
and
also
in
defining
the
word
responsible.
and
if
every
time
a
democrat
loses
a
contract,
or
a
republican
loses
a
contract,
he
can
go
into
court,
then
the
administrators
of
the
contracting
system
must
look
for
objective
criteria
so
that
they
can
prove
they
weren't
motivated
by
the
political
reason,
and
at
that
point
their
ability
to
award
contracts
is
severely
injured.
they
can't
use
subjective
judgment.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
goes
under
the
title,
efficiency
of
government,
and
what
i'm
looking
for
is
some
kind
of
line
that
you
would
propose
that
permits
that
consideration
called
efficiency
of
government
to
still
work
while
protecting,
let's
say,
the
egregious
case
that
you
might
have
found,
and
i
don't
know
how
to
draw
that
line.
unknown
speaker
yes,
there
are
135
times
the
words
responsible
lowest
bidder
appears.
then
there'll
be
a
category,
i
guess
you'll
say
it's
$200
million
worth...
that's
not
billions,
but
it's
significant...
that
fall
outside
it,
but
that
suggests
to
me
that's
what
we're
dealing
with.
and
when
we're
talking
about
that
kind
of
animal,
how
do
we
preserve
the
ability
of
the
government
to
work
efficiently
while
stopping
the
egregious
instance.
that's
what
i
don't
see.
what's
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
mt.
healthy,
he
comes
in,
he
says,
i
am
a
human
being
who
is
a
contractor.
i
am
a
republican.
i
did
not
get
the
contract.
a
democrat
got
the
contract,
and
now,
i
am
reasonably
qualified,
i
got
into
the
final
round,
so
we'll
put
the
burden
on
the
other
side
to
prove
that
it
wasn't
politically
motivated.
that
isn't
too
hard.
unknown
speaker
mr.
grossman,
earlier
you
said
you
drew...
in
response
to
justice
scalia
you
said,
this
is
a
termination
case,
and
you
seemed
to
exclude
getting
your
foot
in
the
door
in
the
first
place,
bidding,
getting
on
the
list.
i
thought
you
said,
in
answer
to
the
chief
as
well,
being
thrown
off
the
list
that
you've
been
on
for
30
years
is
different
from
not
being
put
on
the
list
in
the
first
place.
now,
are
you
abandoning
that
distinction
in
your
response
to
justice
breyer?
unknown
speaker
then
how
do
you
justify
the
distinction?
unknown
speaker
but
counsel,
that
simply
doesn't
help
us
resolve
this
case.
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
independent
contractors
in
some
instances
are
included
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
in
these
patronage
cases,
and
we
are
concerned
about
the
principle
way
to
decide
the
case,
and
you
just
can
give
us
no
explanation
for
why,
in
the
chief
justice's
instance,
the
same
principle
should
not
apply,
and
maybe
it
should--
unknown
speaker
--but
it's
part
of
our
function...
it's
your
function
to
argue
the
case
and
win.
it's
our
function
to
write
an
opinion.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
what
the
cost
of
that
is.
i
mean,
what
justice
breyer
is
concerned
about
is
there
is
a
place
in
government
for
subjective
evaluation,
and
perhaps
especially
in
contracting,
not
just
for
who
has
the
lowest
bid
and
all
sorts
of
numerical
and
objective
criteria,
but
for
factors
that
must
be
subjectively
evaluated.
they
have
to
be
cast
away
if
there
is
this
risk
of
litigation
on
the
basis
of
awarding
it
to
somebody
of
the
wrong
party.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
the
employment
area,
you
see,
there
was
an
exception
written
in
to
elrod
and
branti,
and
that
exception
did
cause
a
lot
of
litigation
in
the
first
circuit.
there
were...
we
had
six...
there
were
600
confidential
employees
fired
when
they
changed
government
in
puerto
rico
in
1984,
the
political...
and
300
of
them
brought
lawsuits.
that
was
very
tough
to
work
out.
what
i'm
looking
for
here
is,
is
there
a
similar
kind
of
exception?
when
you
buy
a
pencil
from
the
gsa,
when
the
government
orders
a
pencil,
often
to
buy
a
pencil
there
are
all
kinds
of
papers.
it
takes
forever,
and
some
of
the
reason
for
that
was
because
the
gsa
was
worried
about
being
able
to
substantial
100
percent
that
there
were
no
subjective
impermissible
factors
going
into
the
government
procurement
process.
that
slows
it
down,
stops
it
from
working.
so
what
is
a
standard
whereby
we
can
assure
that
that
kind
of
thing
can
work,
at
the
same
time
protect
your
client?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you've
already
told
me
that
you
would
apply
a
stricter
standard
in
the
independent
contractor
situation
than
for
employees,
so--
unknown
speaker
--citing
what's
happened
to
employees
in
promotion
cases
under
a
more
balanced
standard
seems
to
me
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
how
we
would
respond
to
justice
breyer's
line-drawing
in
your
situation.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
ask
another
question.
would
you
have
precisely
the
same
case
and
the
same
standard
if
it
were
speech-related?
suppose
that
mr.
grossman
just
put
up
the
sign...
excuse
me,
your
client
put
up
a
sign
supporting
the
mayor's
opponent,
and
we
didn't
have
this
element
of
the
refusal
to
contribute.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
this
case.
that's
what
paragraph
12
of
the
complaint
alleges.
unknown
speaker
that
is
this
case.
unknown
speaker
paragraph
12
of
the
complaint
specifically
alleges
that
he
was
terminated
because
he
carried
campaign
posters.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
why
there
should
be
a
distinction--
unknown
speaker
--in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
grossman,
victorious
political
parties,
especially
at
the
municipal
level,
have
been
awarding
contracts
to
their
political
friends
since
god
made
little
apples,
at
least
since
he
made
them
in
this
country.
we
have
recently
held
that
discrimination
in
contracting
on
the
basis
of
race
is
no
good,
even
if
you
do
it
for
the
best
of
motives.
don't
you
think
that
there
might
be
some
cause
for
upset
if
minority
groups
that
have
finally
wrested
control
of
various
municipalities
from
previous
minority
groups
who
had
control,
suddenly,
as
soon
as
they
get
in,
are
confronted
with
a
whole
new
regime?
now
you
can
no
longer
give
contracts
to
your
friends.
now
everybody
has
to
come
in
on
an
equal
basis.
unknown
speaker
and
moreover,
you
can't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
in
the
awarding
of
contracts,
although
previously
you
could
have
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
political
affiliation.
why
should
we
change
the
rule
in
the
middle
of
the
game
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
some
of
our
cases...
for
instance,
in
the
reapportionment
cases
we've
held
that
political
gerrymanders
are
okay,
but
racial
gerrymanders
are
not,
so
we
have
not
applied
the
same
standard
to
political
considerations
as
we
have
to
racial
considerations.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
city
of
northlake
had
said,
here,
we
want
$100
from
each
towing
contractor.
we
don't
care
whether
you
vote
for
the
mayor
or
not.
your
political
beliefs
are
your
own,
but
just
pay
$100
to
the
mayor's
campaign
fund.
unknown
speaker
but
it
certainly
doesn't
force
anyone
to
change
their
political
beliefs.
unknown
speaker
what
about
favoring
contractors
who
are
environmentalists,
who
are
active
in
environmental
causes?
would
that
be
bad?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
this
is
a
political
view.
these
people,
they're
greens.
can
you
favor
greens
over,
i
don't
know,
whatever
the
other
ones
are,
browns,
or
blacks,
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
but
i
can't
favor
them
just
because
i
want
to
give
business
to
a
company
that
i
think
has
its
head
on
straight
as
far
as
what's
good
for
the
country
is
concerned?
i
can't
do
that?
because
that's
sort
of
a
political
view.
unknown
speaker
mr.
grossman,
on
the
subject
of
lines,
you
never
did
say
what
would
be
a
rational
distinction
between
not
putting
one
on
the
list
and
taking
one
off
the
list,
that's
one
thing,
and
then
you
seemed
to
say
we
should
have
a
stricter
standard
when
we're
dealing
with,
give
money
to
the
incumbent,
don't
support
the
challenger,
a
stricter
standard
for
that
than
someone
who
goes
around
criticizing
government
policy.
are
those
your
positions,
or
are
you
saying
all
of
this
gets
together,
and
it's
the
same
first
amendment
standard
for
all
of
them,
whether
it's
expression
about
government
policy
or
patronage,
whether
it's
getting
on
the
list
or
being
taken
off
the
list,
the
same
standard
for
all
of
these?
unknown
speaker
then
you're
changing
from
the
way
you
started.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
shouldn't
you
be
talking
about
balancing,
rather
than
the
strictest
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
was
true
in
a
speech
situation
with
a
public
employee,
if
the
person
who
applied
for
public
employment,
but
had
not
yet
been
hired,
had
been
engaging
in
speech
which,
had
he
been
hired
would
in
some
sense
have
been
antithetical
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
government
job?
would
you
say
that
that
somehow
could
not
be
considered,
it
couldn't
be
balanced
because
at
the
moment
of
the
speech
he
was
simply
a
member
of
the
general
public?
unknown
speaker
then
why
isn't
the
same...
all
right,
then
why
isn't
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--all
right,
then
why
isn't
the
same
kind
of
balancing
going
to
be
appropriate
when
you're
talking
about
a
person
who
wants
to
be
an
independent
contractor
but
has
not
yet
gotten
a
contract?
unknown
speaker
so
the
difference
is
speech
versus
association,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
understand
what
you're
saying.
i
had
thought
that
the
reason
the
associational
applicant
for
a
contract
was,
in
fact,
not
going
to
be
subject
to
balancing
in
any
sense
was
that
he
was
simply
a
member
of
the
general
public,
but
i
think
your
reason,
if
i
understand
you
now
is,
there
never
can
be
a
balancing
on
an
associational
issue.
that's
purely
for
speech.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
grossman.
mr.
feiereisel,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask,
before
you
get
into
your
discussion
of
independent
contractors,
this
fellow,
of
course,
wasn't
a
contractor
with
the
city.
he
was
just
on
a
towing
list.
unknown
speaker
they
had
a
list,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
he
didn't
have
an
agreement
to
stay
on
the
list,
did
he?
he
didn't
have
any
contractual
right,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
so
he's
not
an
independent
contractor.
his
contracts
are
with
people
who
need
towing
services,
not
with
the
city.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
agree
that
if
he
were
purely
a
member
of
the
public,
not
a
contractor
at
all,
who
wanted
to
wear
campaign
buttons...
and
it's
alleged
here
he
displayed
campaign
posters
for
the
opponent
of
the
city.
if
an
independent,
just
a
member
of
the
public
displayed
campaign
posters
for
the
opponent
of
the
mayor,
could
the
city
punish
that
person
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
and
what
if
they
had
facilities
such
as
a
museum,
could
they
deprive
the
members
of
the
public
of
entrance
to
the
museum
because
they
wore
campaign
buttons?
unknown
speaker
now,
why
is
it
that--
--are
you
sure
of
that,
that
they
couldn't
punish...
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
punish.
would
the
mayor
have
to
invite
this
person
to
a
dinner
at
the
mayor's
mansion?
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
what
the
mayor
does.
can
they
use
city
authority
to
deprive
that
member
of
the
public
from
services
that
other
equally
qualified
people
would
be
eligible
for?
unknown
speaker
we're
talking
about
the
first
amendment
right--
unknown
speaker
--to
display
a
campaign
button
opposing
the
reelection
of
the
incumbent
in
office.
unknown
speaker
wants
to
go
into
a
public
museum
and
the
mayor
says,
no,
you
were
wearing
a
button
against
me
before,
so
you
can't
come
in.
unknown
speaker
now
why,
then,
can
he
keep
this
member
of
the
public
off
the
towing
list
if
he's
otherwise
qualified
for
it?
unknown
speaker
if
his
only
sin
is
displaying
a
campaign
poster,
that's
the
only
thing
he's
done,
and
that's
what's
alleged
in
paragraph
12
of
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
but
they're
not
public
services.
they're
private
towing
services
that
they
want
to
give
to
motorists
who
are
in
distress.
they're
not
providing
any
service
to
the
city.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying,
i
suppose,
is
if
there
are
10
qualified
towing
truck
operators,
five
of
whom
voted
against
the
mayor
and
five
voted
for
him,
the
public
is
benefitted
by
saying
we'll
only
allow
the
five
who
voted
for
the
mayor
on
the
list.
that
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feiereisel,
i
had
thought
that
this
case
involved
services
provided
to
the
city.
that
is
what
is
stated
in
the
statement
of
the
case
both
in
the
petition
and
in
the
brief
by
the
petitioner.
it
says
o'hare
provided
the
city
with
towing
services.
both
the
petition
and
the
principal
brief
says
that,
and
i
thought
that's
the
assumption
on
which
we're
trying
to
decide
this
case.
unknown
speaker
in
any
case,
we--
--rather
than
what's
alleged
in
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
there
is
at
least
this
agreement
between
the
tower
and
the
city:
the
tower
says,
if
you
put
me
on
the
list,
i
promise
to
go
when
i'm
called.
i
will
sort
of
guarantee
that
the
service,
which
benefits
not
only
the
auto...
automobile
owner
but
the
city
that
wants
its
streets
clean,
is
a
service
that
i
promise
to
provide
if
called
upon.
is
that
the
nature
of
the
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
yes.
he
says,
if
you
put
me
on
the
list,
i'll
go
when
you
call
me.
is
that
fair
to
say?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
who
pays
for
it?
unknown
speaker
who
pays
for
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
motorist
doesn't
pay...
i
mean,
the
city
pays
nothing.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
are
they
selling
something
to
the
city,
then?
unknown
speaker
mr.
feiereisel--
unknown
speaker
--would
your
answer
be
different
if,
instead
of
putting
the
company
on
the
list,
the
question
were
licensing
companies
to
provide
towing
services
and
the
city
allows
only
people
who
are
licensed
to
perform
these
services,
whether
called
by
the
police
or
called
by
a
private
person,
and
mr.
gratzianna
can't
get
a
license
for
this
year
because
he
backed
the
wrong
candidate?
unknown
speaker
meets
all...
you're
not
contending
here
that
there's
any
question
about
qualifications
to
do
the
towing
job?
unknown
speaker
mustn't
we
assume
for
this
purpose--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
well,
let's
assume
that
this
mayor
says,
nobody
gets
a
license
to
perform
towing
service
unless
they
supported
me.
unknown
speaker
and
gratzianna
didn't
support
the
mayor
so
he
doesn't
get
a
license,
and
he
challenges
that
and
says
that
my
first
amendment
rights
have
been
infringed.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
a
difference
is
that...
i
gather
from
justice
ginsburg's
question
that
the
license
might
be
necessary
to
perform
towing
services
not
just
for
the
city
but
for
private
individuals.
do
you
think
the
city
could
say,
you
can't
be
in
the
business
of
towing
private
individuals
in
northlake
if
you
didn't
contribute
to
the
mayor's
campaign?
unknown
speaker
but
what's
the
interest?
i
mean,
if
the
interest
of
the
city
is
to
have
qualified,
prompt,
well-performing
tow
services
available,
and
if
it
knows
that
the
service
provided
by
o'hare
fits
that
category,
what
further
interest
does
it
have
in
saying
we're
only
going
to
allow
it
for
someone
who
contributed
to
the
mayor's
campaign?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
think
that
the
failure
to
contribute
somehow
means
that
the
service
will
not
be
properly
provided?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
we
take
this
case,
as
we've
already
established,
on
the
assumption
that
o'hare
is
qualified
and
has
performed
adequately
in
the
past,
and
would
be
expected
to
in
the
future?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
took
the
case
on
that
assumption.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
so
let's
get
that
out
of
the
hypothetical.
what
additional
interest
does
the
city
have
in
saying
that
only
someone
who
contributes
to
the
mayor
can
be
on
that
list?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
feiereisel--
--but
isn't--
--the
whole...
the
vast
business
of
government
is
done
on
the
basis
of
competitive
bidding,
merit
selection,
and
the
government
is
trusting
people
all
the
time
if
they
put
in
the
lowest
bid,
even
if
they're
from
the
opposite
party,
so
your
notion
that
this
doesn't...
this
is
unreliable,
it's
unreliable,
doesn't
seem
to
hold
up,
since
we're
all
agreed
that
for
the
most
part
government
contracts,
government
employment
is
given
out
on
the
basis
of
merit
or
lowest
bid.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there,
in
those
cases...
you...
what
you're
saying,
it's
not
workable.
i
can
understand
your
saying
it
doesn't
have
to
be
done,
but
when
you
give
the
excuse
that
efficient
government
operations
are
deterred,
the
scheme
won't
work,
i
think
that
the
experience
is
just
contrary
to
that.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
the
party
system
that
was
your...
i
thought
you
were
coming
here
prepared
to
defend
the
proposition
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
give
contracts
to
your
friends
who
helped
getting
you
elected,
which--
unknown
speaker
--which
has
been
done
in
this
country
for
200
years--
unknown
speaker
--and
we
haven't
found
it
unconstitutional
for
200
years,
but
you're
not
prepared
to
defend
that
proposition.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
agree
that
the
thing
about
inefficient,
unworkable,
that
that
won't
fly?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
would
you
explain
to
me
how
the
fact
that
the
individual
voted
for
a
different
mayor
undermines
his
capacity
to
provide
a
tow
service?
i
just
don't
get
the
connection.
unknown
speaker
contribute
to,
put
signs
up
for,
however.
how
does
that
create
a
risk
that
he
won't
tow?
doesn't
he
want
to
tow
and
charge
for
the
towing?
unknown
speaker
okay,
then
why
is
there
a
risk
that
he
won't
do
the
towing
because
he
contributed
to,
displayed
signs
for,
voted
for,
a
different
candidate?
unknown
speaker
do
republican
towers
tow
differently
from
democratic
towers?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
do
you
claim
that
he's
going
to
go
out
there
and
say,
and
by
the
way,
in
the
next
election
vote
the
bums
out.
[laughter]
do
you...
is
that
what
they--
unknown
speaker
--the
courts
rejected
that
argument
even
for
government
employees,
who
are
certainly
more
closely
associated
with
the
party
in
power
than
an
independent
contractor.
we've
said
it
doesn't
matter.
we're
not
going
to
assume
that
a
government
employee
is
going
to
mess
up
the
system
just
because
he
comes
from
the
other
party.
you
have
about
10
minutes
left.
you
can
argue
this
point
for
the
next
10
minutes,
but
there's
nothing
to
it.
[laughter]
i
mean,
really,
the
proposition
we're...
i
thought
we
were
going
to
argue
is
whether
you
can
favor
your
friends.
that's
what
this
issue
involves.
if
you
can
tell
me
this
is
a
better
tower,
then
there's
no
problem.
let
me
ask,
why
should
you
be
able
to?
i'm
not
saying
you
should
or
you
shouldn't,
but
suppose--
--may
i
suggest,
it's
not
favoring
your
friends,
it's
penalizing
your
enemies
that's
alleged
in
this
case.
yes,
that,
too.
that,
too.
for
what
they
said.
for
what
they
said
in
public.
you're
penalizing
people
for
what
they
say
in
public,
and
let's
defend
that
proposition.
unknown
speaker
winner
take
all.
unknown
speaker
why?
because
to
award
them
to
your
friends
is...
whether
every
senator,
congressman,
state
legislator
through
200
years
has
suggested
if
you
have
breakfast
with
me
or
whatever,
maybe
that
will
help,
or
maybe
it
won't,
but
to
do
that,
to
give
contracts
to
your
friends
is
also
to
not
give
them
to
your
enemies,
and
your
enemies,
presumably,
are
those
who
voted
for
the
opposite
side.
all
right,
so
maybe
that's
gone
on
for
200
years,
but
the
question
that's
being
put
by
the
other
side
is,
fine,
what
is
the
logical
justification
for
penalizing
your
enemies
by
helping
your
friends?
unknown
speaker
do
you
accept
the
proposition,
mr.
feiereisel,
that
if
something
is
illogical
it
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
mr.
feiereisel,
suppose
my
friends
and
my
enemies
correspond
with
certain
racial
or
religious
groups.
suppose
one
particular
church
campaigned,
the
members
of
that
church
campaigned
against
the
incumbent,
and
so
the
people
who
are
taken
off
the
towing
list
are
all
members
of
that
religion,
would
that
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
taking
it
out
of...
they
happen
to
be
of
one
religion,
but
they
also
oppose
the
incumbent.
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
know
if
there's
any
first
amendment...
any
constitutional
control
here
at
all.
unknown
speaker
are
you...
you
seem
at
one
point
to
be
taking
the
position
that
the
government
contracts
just
like
a
private
person
contracts
and
there
is
no
constitutional
limitation
intruded
into
that,
but
you're
not
taken
that
position.
unknown
speaker
just
no
first
amendment,
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
not
the
religion
part
of
the
first
amendment,
so
if
the--
unknown
speaker
--or
race,
or
national
origin.
unknown
speaker
those
limits
would
apply
to
the
government.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
entirely
sure,
though.
i
mean,
i
thought
you're
just
arguing
for
the
spoils
system,
the
good
old-fashioned
spoils
system,
and
not
for
racial
bigotry
or
religious
bigotry--
unknown
speaker
--you
shouldn't
say
those
issues
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
you
should
say
that
you're
argument
would
not
approve
of
those
things
at
all,
because
that's
not
part
of
the
spoils
system.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
about...
are
you
familiar
with
the
shockman
decree
in
chicago?
unknown
speaker
it's
been
in
effect
for
about
20
years,
i
think.
has
that
been
unworkable?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
governed
hiring
in
chicago,
a
very
large
community,
for
about
20
years,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
we've
been
flooded
with
cases
arising
out
of
the
interpretation
of
that
decree.
you're
familiar
with
it,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
it
survived
in
the
change
of
administration
when
a
black
mayor
succeeded
a
white
mayor,
it
didn't
cause
insuperable
problems
or
anything.
it
was
the
same
party,
wasn't
it?
[laughter]
unless
chicago
has
a
republican
mayor
these
days--
unknown
speaker
--it
didn't
when
i
lived
there,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
there's
no
political
division
within
the
democratic
party,
either.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
on
the
distinction
between
hiring
and
firing,
are
you
familiar
with
the
wygant
case?
unknown
speaker
it
did
draw
just
precisely
that
distinction,
and
said
it
made
a
constitutional
difference,
but
perhaps
you're
not
familiar--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
feiereisel.
mr.
grossman,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
could
you
say
just
in
1
second
who
pays?
does
the
municipality
pay,
or
the
customer?
we
have
different
views.
the
court
of
appeals
says
one,
the
petition
the
other.
unknown
speaker
but
he
makes
a
commitment
to
the
city
to
go,
not
just
to
the
individual.
i
mean,
the
deal
is--
unknown
speaker
--the
city
gives
him
the
authorization,
and
he
commits
himself
to
go.
