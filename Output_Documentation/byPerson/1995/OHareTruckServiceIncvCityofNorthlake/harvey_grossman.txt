mr.
harvey
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
whether
the
first
amendment
provides
any
level
of
protection
whatsoever
to
a
businessman
who's
cut
out
from
city
business
after
30
years
of
competent
performance
in
retaliation
for
refusing
to
contribute
to
the
mayor's
reelection
campaign
and
supporting
the
opposition.
this
penalty
on
association
invoked
in
this
case
resulted
in
the
substantial
loss
of
income
to
mr.
gratzianna,
the
petitioner
here.
i
wish
to
focus
first
on
the
aspect
of
forced
contribution
involved
in
the
conduct
of
the
respondents
in
this
case.
the
precipitating
event
was
mr.
gratzianna's
refusal
to
be
coerced
out
of
a
substantial
campaign
contribution.
making
that
contribution
would
have
been
contrary
to
his
own
political
beliefs.
this
conduct
by
the
respondent
should
be
condemned,
not
sanitized
as
patronage
practice
which
purports
to
serve
the
democratic
process.
this
practice
corrupts
rather
than
advances
any
meaningful
interests
of
government.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
we
seek
here
is
a
civil
remedy
when
the
burden
of
reasonable
doubt
is
not
imposed
on
the
petitioner,
where--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
petitioner's
rights
here
are
dependent
upon
the
public
employment
patronage
cases
whatsoever.
i
believe
there
is
independent
doctrine
that
we've
cited
in
our
briefs
which
prohibit
penalties
on
association,
which
prohibit
forced
contributions,
and
which
also
allow
people
to
express
themselves
politically
particularly
in
their
private
work
place
or
on
their
private
property.
mr.
harvey
grossman
no,
i
don't
believe
that
within
the
confines
of
the
criminal
law
that
a
quid
pro
quo
was
established
here,
but
what
we
seek
to
do,
and
i
want
to
stress
to
your
honor,
is
an
opportunity
to
provide
a
court
with
the
proof
of
what
did
occur,
and
have
a
court
determine
whether
or
not
that
violates
the
first
amendment.
what's
critical
here
is
that
the
lower
courts
have
said
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
protection
whatsoever,
so
notwithstanding
the
ability
of
a
litigant
even
to
prove
the
quid
pro
quo
that
you've
suggested--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
wasn't
suggesting
that
they
did,
your
honor.
i
was
suggesting
that
even
if
you
place
that
burden
on
the
litigant
here,
that
he
nevertheless
should
have
an
opportunity
to
go
before
a
civil
court
and
prove
that
the
violation
of
his
first
amendment's,
whether
it
resulted
from
a
quid
pro
quo,
or
the
implicit
imposition
of
a
penalty,
as
it
did
this
case,
violates
the
first
amendment.
because
there
are
criminal
laws
that
exist
to
protect
interests
does
not
mean
that
we
do
not
have
corollaries
in
the
civil
law
which
also
under
our
constitution
provide
a
means
for
redress.
there
are
numerous
instances
where
that
occurs,
from
instances
of
policemen's
conduct
in
illegal
search
and
seizure,
straight
through
the
panoply
of
constitutional--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no,
the
civil
formulation...
i
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor.
i
think
the
civil
formulation
of
that
is
that
in
fact
his
first
amendment
rights
were
violated
as
well,
independent
of
the
question
of
whether
the
government
has
chosen,
responsibly,
i
think,
to
create
official
misconduct
laws
or
extortion
laws.
mr.
harvey
grossman
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor,
although
i
think
that
those
cases
can
very
well
be
instructive
in
terms
of
analyzing
the
government's
interest
that
it
might
assert
in
this
case.
i
don't
say
that
they
transfer
in
toto,
because
i
wish
to
stress
that
i
did
not
represent
a
public
employee.
the
gentleman
that
appears
before
this
court
cannot
conceivably
be
compared
to
a
public
employee.
he
does
not
provide
services
in
the
government
work
place
or
at
a
government
work
site.
he
does
not
work
shoulder-to-shoulder
with
other
government
employees.
he
has
no
government
supervisor.
he
is
not
in
a
chain
of
command.
his
services
are
straightforward.
they're
determined
by
the
custom
and
practices
within
the
industry
in
which
he
works.
he
can't
be
said
to
speak
for
the
city
or
any
official.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
do.
i
think
there's
a
continuum
on
which
independent
contractors
provide
services.
i
think
that
the
closer
that
they
look
like
employees...
and
i've
just
gone
five
or
six
factors
myself...
the
closer
that
they
look
like
employees,
i
think
more
legitimately
can
they
be
regulated
as
public
employees.
my
client--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--yes,
i
would,
and
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
that
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
regarding
the
regulation
of
public
employees
and
their
first
amendment
rights
as
recently
as
its
decision
in
waters,
it
stressed
that
it
really
was
not
the
operation
of
government
per
se,
or
governmental
efficiency,
that
resulted
in
a
freer
hand
in
restricting
the
rights
of
public
employees,
it
was
the
nature
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
and
this
court
said
that
what
was
comparatively
a
subordinate
interest
vis-a-vis
the
general
public...
that
is,
operational
efficiency...
becomes
more
pronounced
and
weighty
when
you're
talking
about
the
interaction
of
an
employee
in
the
workforce,
understandably,
just
based
on
every-day
human
relations,
and
i
don't
challenge
whatsoever
that
proposition,
but
when--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
first,
if
the
question
is,
should
there
be
a
cognizable
claim
at
all,
that
doesn't
deal
with
the
standard.
if
the
question
is,
should
contractors
be
subjected
to
a
reasonableness
balancing
standard
instead
of
strict
scrutiny,
at
least
we're
half-way
there
already,
because
all
of
the
courts
below
have
said
that
there's
no
level
of
scrutiny
that's
to
be
applied
to
this
conduct.
now,
even
if
a
reasonableness
test
was
applied
here,
i
would
maintain
that
whatever
it
is
that
the
respondents
maintain
they've
done
here...
we
view
it
as
a
simple
act
of
political
retaliation
and
forced
contribution.
it's
been
siphoned
through
the
screen
of
patronage
law,
but
whatever
it
is,
we
believe
that
it
would
not
withstand
even
a
reasonable
balancing
test.
mr.
harvey
grossman
no,
i
would
not.
without
more
facts,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
state
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
i'm
not
exactly--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
i
think
this
court
need
only
deal
with
this
case
as
a
termination
of
a
benefit,
a
penalty
case.
it
need
not
decide
what
might
be
a
more
perplexing
question
for
some
members
of
the
court
as
to
whether--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
i
believe
that
if...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
hypothetical
with
clarity.
if
it
would
result
in
the
termination--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
state
a--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
precise
distinction
that
you're
making
between
the
termination--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--it
is--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--that's
clearly
the
case,
and
i
think
in
the
proper
benefits
case...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
i
don't
think
there
are
parallels
in
the
law
that
would
support
a
claim
that
a
denial
of
a
contract
also
would
be
actionable,
but
that's
not
the
case
before
this
court.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is.
i
believe--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
because--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
believe
that
the
person
you've
described
has
a
political
identity.
that
is,
the
president.
i
think
he's
free
to
exercise
that
role
as
well
as
his
role
as
executive
administering
the
laws.
mr.
harvey
grossman
because
he
has,
in
this
precise
instance,
chosen
to
terminate
a
business
relationship.
it
isn't
a
question
of
opening
up
access
to
other
qualified
persons
who
happen
to
give
him
a
contribution.
it
is,
instead,
a
direct
penalty
on
belief
because
he
has
terminated
a
30-year-old
benefit
to
an
individual
simply
on
the
grounds
of
refusal
to
contribute.
mr.
harvey
grossman
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
harvey
grossman
well,
i
think
first,
just
as
a
note,
over
$200
million
worth
of
no-bid
contracts
were
allocated
by
the
state
of
illinois
in
1991--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
think
that
what
we
do...
i
think
that
the
court
has
already
answered
that
question,
and
i
think
it
has
done
it
substantially
by
its
formulation
of
a
burden
of
proof
in
mt.
healthy
v.
doyle.
not
only
would
the
bidder
have
to
show
in
fact
that
there
was
political
motivation,
but
he
would
also
ultimately
have
to
show
that
there
was
no
other
permissible
reason
on
which
he--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--that
isn't
very
hard,
except
that
that
hasn't
been
sufficient
in
the
political
discharge
cases
to
date.
that
is
not
how
the
proof
has
gone.
i
think
a
good
indication--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no,
i
don't
believe
i
am.
i
think
that--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
believe
that
if
there's
a
penalty
case
and
you
can
look
at
injury
to
the
individual,
he
clearly
has
standing
and
he's
clearly
suffered
a
constitutional
wrong,
in
some
instance
the
patronage
cases
have
looked
to
whether
or
not
coercion
takes
place.
that
is,
is
the
benefit
substantial
enough,
or
the
nature
of
the
relationship
substantial
enough,
in
order
to
really
make
someone
alter
beliefs?
i
don't
believe
that
that
dichotomy
is
necessarily
a
valid
one,
but
it
nevertheless
exists
in
the
law.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
members
of
the
court
who
believe
that
that
is
a
more
difficult
question
to
grapple
with,
i
think
it
is
not
presented
on
the
record
here
and
it
need
not
be
included.
mr.
harvey
grossman
well,
i
believe
that
it
should.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
will
have
formulated...
let
me
try
to
put
it
into
the
real
world
for
a
second.
illinois
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
it
has
shown
that
what
it
did
was
seek
out
professional
consultation
through
a
professional
management
company
which
has
restructured
its
workforce
and
has
provided
the
very
standards
that
justice
breyer
suggests
exist
that
reflect
some
objective
merit-based
hiring.
since
that
has
occurred,
you
can
see
from
the
response
in
our
reply
brief,
there
are
virtually
no
employees
who
are
winning
political
discharge
cases,
and
there
are
no
employees
winning
promotion
cases,
because
the
mt.
healthy
burden
which
i
suggested
to
you
allows
government
to
come
in
and
show
an
independent,
permissible
basis.
it
does
not
mean--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no
more
than
it
had
to
be
cast
away
in
the
employment
decisions.
the
same
thing
is
true.
there
is
a
subjective
evaluation
that
is
made
between
equally
competent
and
qualified
employees.
it
happens
all
the
time
in
the
workforce,
and
what
the
record
is--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
what
happened
in
the
first
circuit
was
fairly
unique.
what
we
see
happening
now
in
terms
of
the
administration
of
the
branti
standard
and
the
administration
of
the
patronage
contracting
case...
patronage
employment
cases
is
a
routinization
of
the
application
of
the
standard.
four
circuits
have
agreed--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--a
strict--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
i
think
that
strict
scrutiny
has
been
applied
in
the
employee
patronage
cases,
but
even
under
a
reasonableness
standard
contract
patronage
would
not
be...
would
not
withstand
scrutiny.
this
is
not...
this
is
a
viewpoint-based,
partisan-enforced
practice
that
requires
a
contribution
of
a
precise
amount,
and
which
is
a
substantial
tax
on
a
small
businessman's
ability
to
function
whatsoever,
so
whatever
level
of
scrutiny
this
court
would
choose,
i
would
maintain--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--that
contract
patronage
cannot
withstand
that.
mr.
harvey
grossman
yes,
i
believe
that
that
also
would
be
protected.
mr.
harvey
grossman
excuse
me?
mr.
harvey
grossman
it
unquestionably
is--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--it
is.
it
is
precisely--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
don't
think
there
should
be.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
think
that
strict
scrutiny
applies
to
both.
i
think--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
think
it's--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
i
believe
that
it's
no
more
permissible
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
political
affiliation
than
it
is
race
or
religion.
and
i
think
that
you
change
the
rule
because
it
conforms
to
the
constitution,
and
i
believe
that
it
is--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
believe
that's
also
correct
in
that
construct,
but
i
believe
where
it
is
used
as
a
penalty
directly
against
the
exercise
of
rights,
that
this
court's
cases
on
viewpoint
discrimination,
and
this
court's
case
on
forced
contribution...
this
isn't
a
matter
of
the
permutations
of
drawing
district
lines.
this
has
to
do
with
a
direct
requirement
that
you
conform
your
political
beliefs
to
a
strict
code,
and
that
you
pay
on
the
line
in
conformity
with
that.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
believe
that
that
would
be
forced
contribution.
it
would
run
afoul
of
abood,
it
would
run
afoul
of
keller--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no.
it
is
a...
in
that
particular
case,
it
is
a
forced
contribution.
it
makes
them
contribute
contrary
to
their
political
beliefs.
if
you
do
not
want
to
support
this
mayor,
but
nevertheless
are
required
to
do
it,
it's
as
great
a
sin
to
be
taxed
as
to
be
penalized
against
your
will.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
don't...
it
would
have
to
be
compared
to
another
construct.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
would
suppose
that
based
on
the
service
that
you
sought
to
provide,
and
i
want
to
stress
that
there
may
very
well
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest
for
some
political
loyalty,
or
there
may
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
i
think
that
it
is
viewpoint
discrimination
and
that
it
is
ideologically
based.
i
think
that
it
poses
different
governmental
interests
than
historically
have
been
asserted
by
those
who
believe
that
patronage
serves
the
democratic
process.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
do
believe
it's
the
same
standard.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
didn't
intend
to.
what
i
believe
are
that
there
are
different
government
interests
implicated
in
those
different
hypotheticals,
but
that--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--because
unless
you
distinguished
yourself,
unless
as
a
contractor
you
start
to
move
on
a
continuum
towards
looking
like
an
employee,
you
are
a
member
of
the
public
at
large,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
restrict
your
rights.
the
person
who
happens
to
sell
paper
supplies
to
the
court
cannot
remotely
be
likened
to
an
employee.
there
is
no
work
place
employer-employee
relationship.
that
has
been
the
basis
for
restricting
the
rights
of
public
employees.
this
court
reaffirmed
that
in
waters
and
defined
that
quite
clearly.
it
was
not
the
efficiency
of
operations,
per
se,
that
gives
it
a
freer
hand
to
regulate
employees.
it
is
the
nature
of
that
relationship,
every-day
functioning
in
the
context
of
supervision,
working
with
other
people
every
day
in
the
work
place.
suppliers
of
office
goods
just
don't
look
like
that.
nor
do
towing
operators
look
like
that,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
pull
them
out
of
the
public
and
treat
them
to
a
lesser
standard
for
very,
very
basic
rights
of
where
they
put
their
campaign
dollars.
mr.
harvey
grossman
no.
it
might
very
well
be
a
relevant
consideration.
mr.
harvey
grossman
if
it
impacts
on
the
performance
of
the
future
job.
mr.
harvey
grossman
it
might
be
that
if
he
is
engaged
in
speech
which
is
related
to
the
performance
of
a
job--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
believe
that
association
cannot
be
related
to
the
performance
of
the
service.
that
is
the
foundation
of
this
argument.
if
you
can
prove
that
it
is,
if
political
loyalty
is,
in
fact,
relevant,
if
someone
who
hires
a--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
believe
that
that
is
true.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harvey
grossman
the...
it
actually
varies.
there
are
authorized
tows
where
the...
mr.
gratzianna
can
only
be
on
the
scene
with
the
authorization
of
the
municipality.
those
are
abandoned
vehicles.
we've
tried
to
explain
that
by
citing
illinois
law
in
our
complaint.
in
those
instances,
the
individual
driver
still
pays,
but
they
could
not...
it
is
similar
to
the
licensing
that
has
been
described
by
justice
ginsburg.
the
tower
could
not
be
on
the
scene
without
authorization
from
the
city.
there
also
are
city
tows
where
mr.
gratzianna
tows
city
vehicles
and
does
that
pursuant
to
the
list
as
well.
in
those
instances
the
city
does
pay
money.
that's
simply
the
record,
and
i--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
grossman
that
is
correct.
in
terms
of
the
flood
of
litigation
that
was
predicted
here,
i'd
like
to
stress
that
abercrombie
in
the
tenth
circuit
has
given
these
rights
to
public...
to
independent
contractors
since
1990,
and
there's
been
no
litigation.
second,
that
i
do
think
mt.
healthy
addresses
the
question
of
the
flood,
but
nevertheless
i
have
also
attempted
to
carve
out
in
our
briefs
an
exception
that
does
parallel
those
considerations
recognized
in
elrod
and
branti,
and
that
is
that
in
those
few
instances
where
independent
contractors
move
down
that
line
and
do
provide
services
which,
in
terms
of
implementing
policy--
