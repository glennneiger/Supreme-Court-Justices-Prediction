mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
made
clear
that
first
amendment
rights
are
not
absolute.
there
are
encroachments
or
restrictions
on
first
amendment
rights
permissible
for
appropriate
reasons,
and
when
we're
talking
about
an
independent
contractor
context,
those
appropriate
reasons
exist.
to
rule
in
favor
of
petitioners
and
send
this
case
back
down
to
the
district
court,
this
court
must
extend
the
holdings
in
elrod,
branti,
and
rutan
to
the
independent
contractor
governmental
context,
and
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
should
not
be
done.
first
of
all--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--he
didn't
have
a
formal
contract
with
the
city
of
northlake,
but
essentially
that
is
why
he
was
doing
what
he
was
doing,
because
the
city
of
northlake
had
an
agreement
or
had
a
towing
rotation
list--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--that
wouldn't
be
there--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--no,
he
did
not.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
it's
essentially
the
same
thing
in
this
context
because
of
his...
the
reason
why
he's
at
the
scene
performing
his
tow.
he
would
not
be
there
but
for
the
city
calling
him
out
to
go
there,
and
i
think
in
that
context
the
analysis
of
an
independent
contractor
is
the
same,
and
my
reading
of
the
briefs
is
that
the
petitioners
have
essentially
admitted
that
this
is
an
independent
contractor
situation.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
no,
it
could
not.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
no,
they
could
not.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
well,
i
guess
in
that
context
it
depends
on
what
we're
talking
about,
and
if
we're
talking
about...
if
we're
talking
about--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--no,
i--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--and
then
if
that
individual,
if
the
incumbent
is
reelected
and
that
individual
then
wants
to--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--no,
i
would
say
that
he
could
not
do
that.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
because
we
get
back
to
what
i
believe--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--well,
we
get
back
to
what
i
believe
is
the
issue
in
the
case,
is
that
in
an
independent
contractor
context,
this
individual
wants
their
name
to
be
put
on
the
towing
rotation
list,
and
the
administration
in
northlake
should
be
allowed
to
use
or
to
hire
or
to
award
contracts
to
people
who
it
knows
supports
its
administration
in
order
that
it
can
make
sure
that
it
delivers
whatever
those
public
services
are
to
the
people
that
had
elected
them.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
they
are
providing
a
service
to
the
city.
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
because
one
of
the
services
they're
providing
to
the
city
is,
for
instance,
you
have
an
automobile
accident
on
one
of
the...
on
a
busy
thoroughfare
through
the
city
of
northlake.
well,
one
of
the
things
that
has
to
happen,
or
that
people
in
northlake
should
be
entitled
to,
is
free
and
safe
flow
of
traffic
in
their
community.
if
you
have
an
automobile
accident
in
that
community
at
a
busy
intersection
and
for
some
reason
you
have
a
tow
truck
operator
who
is
on
your
list
and
who
you
call
out
to
the
scene
to
clear
the
intersection
or
clear
the
problem,
they--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--the
public
is
entitled...
the
public
is
deserving
of
independent
contractors
who
will
provide
safe,
efficient,
and
effective
public
services.
i
think
that--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--that
was
my
thought
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
well,
it
is
what's
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
i
again
disagree
with,
respectfully,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
the
nature
of...
essentially
i
believe
that's
the
nature
of
the
arrangement.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
correct.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
assuming--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--assuming
he
has
trucks
available.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
oh,
i
think
typically
the
motorist
pays
for
it.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
the
city
pays
nothing
but--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--they're
not
selling
anything
to
the
city,
your
honor.
what
they're
doing
is,
they're
providing
a
public
service
that
i
think
not
only
the
motorist
benefits
from
but
the
city
benefits
from,
and
the
reason
they're
at...
the
reason
they're
there
is
because
the
city
is...
has
put
them
there.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
yes.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
well,
i
think
that
in
that
situation
it
may
very
well
depend
on
what
the
qualifications
are,
or
what
the--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--well,
i
don't
know
that,
because
there's
no...
the
complaint
doesn't--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--we
must,
but
i
don't
think
just
because
we
assume
that
because--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--and--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i
don't
see
that
that's
a
different
situation
than
this
situation.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
no,
i
don't
think
they
could
say
that.
i'm
talking
about...
i
understood
the
question
to
be
a
license
to
do
the
kind
of
work
that
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
here,
which
is
to
provide
towing
services
to
the
city
of
northlake,
and
in
that
context
i
think
that
there
would
be
the
same
situation
as
we're
talking
about.
i
don't
believe
that
an
administration,
whether
it's
newly
elected
or
whether
it's
an
incumbent
administration,
should
be
forced
to
face
the
risk
of
using
independent
contractors
that
it
knows
does
not
support
it,
because
when
they're
faced
with
that
risk,
they're
faced
with--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i
don't
know
if
once
the...
once
the
petitioner
in
this
case
doesn't
contribute
or
doesn't
support
the
administration
that
we
know
that
any
more,
because
especially
in
local--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i
don't
know
that.
that's
a
possibility.
local...
in
local--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--that's--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--that
is...
that
is
what's
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
that's
why--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--that's
why
we
are
here.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
the
interest
that
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
your
honor,
is
that
i
believe
that
regardless
of
whether
the
petitioner
or
an
independent
contractor
says
they
will
do
whatever
they
are
nired
to
do
correctly,
properly,
is
not
really
the
point,
because
when
you
are
forced
to
retain
or
hire
independent
contractors
that
you
know
do
not
support
you,
your
administration,
your
policies,
and
your
programs,
then
you
are
running
the
risk
of
that
specific,
independent
contractor
potentially
undermining
your
administration
in
some
way,
and
i
think
that
is
especially
true
when
we're
talking
about--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--well,
in
those
situations,
your
honor,
where
there's...
where
there
are
other
statutes
applicable,
then
we
wouldn't
be
talking
about
it.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
well--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i
was
getting--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i
was--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--no,
i
was
getting
to
that.
i
was
getting
to
that.
i--
[laughter]
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
sure,
i
think...
no,
i
will
not,
i
will
not
agree
with
that,
because
i
think
that--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--well,
first
of
all,
i...
we're
not...
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
who
they
vote
for.
i
don't...
we
don't
care
who
they
vote
for.
we're
not
trying
to
force
them--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i
would
assume
that
he
doesn't,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
he
may
very
well
do
the
towing,
but
he
may
do
it
in
a...
he's
out
at
the
scene
to
do
his
towing
because
northlake
sent
him
there,
esse
tially,
so
the
people
who
he's
towing
for
are
basically
seeing
him
as
somebody
from
the
city.
now,
whether
he
does
the
towing
correctly
or
doesn't
do
it
correctly,
if
he...
if
there
is
some
agenda,
and
obviously
in
this--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i'm
not
saying
that
they
do.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
i
don't
know
what
he's
going
to
do.
i
don't
know
what
he's
going
to
do,
your
honor,
but
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i
think
that
what
we
have
to
do
when
we're
talking
about
a
democratic
process
is,
you
are
entitled,
as
the
administration
in
power
to
award
contracts
to
people
who
support
you,
and
that
may--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--maybe.
maybe.
that
may--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--the
logical
justification
is,
you
should
be
able
to
reward
your
supporters
because
it's
the
democratic
process.
you
should
be
able
to
do
that,
and
you
should
not
have
to
suffer
the
risk
of
facing
a
first
amendment
lawsuit
every
time
someone
is
not
awarded
a
contract
when
they
think
they
should
have
been
awarded
a
contract,
especially
if
they
have
already
established
themselves
as
a
supporter
of
the
opposition.
then
there's
going
to
be
a
first
amendment
lawsuit
filed
every
time
that
situation
arises,
and
what
happens
then
is,
there's
going
to
be...
there's
going
to
be,
even
more
so
than
in
the
employer-employee
context,
an
unbelievable
amount
of
litigation
that
i
think
is
going
to
arise
from
that.
it
was
alluded
to
a
little
bit
before,
but
i
think
when
you're
talking
about
an
independent
contractor
situation,
you
have
a
lot
more
disappointed
independent
contractors
who
don't
get
their
bids
accepted
than
you
have
employees
who
don't
get
hired,
or
who
don't
get
promoted
or
transferred,
or
some
other
employment
decision.
so
you're
facing
the
prospect
here
of
saying
that
independent
contractors
have
certain
first
amendment
rights,
and
that's
opening
a
potential
floodgate
of
litigation.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
no,
i
don't
accept
that
proposition,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
another
consideration
in
this
setting
is
once...
i
get
back
to
my
point
before,
that
you
shouldn't...
they
admitted
you
should
not
have
to
suffer
the
risk
of
running
into
an
independent
contractor
who
has
whatever
agenda
he
may
have.
clearly,
based
upon
what
is
alleged
in
this
complaint,
the
petitioner
does
not
support
the
mayor
and
vigorously
supports
the
opposition,
so
he...
the
mayor
should
not
be
penalized
and
northlake
should
not
be
penalized
because
he
does
not
want
to
run
the
risk
of
this
particular
independent
contractor
or
any
independent
contractor
doing
something
to
undermine
his
administration.
he
should
be
allowed
to--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--well,
then
i
think
you're
taking
it
out
of
a
pure--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--well,
i...
that
may
be
a
different
situation,
but
that's
not
what's
alleged
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
know--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i'm
talking
about
the
first
amendment.
i'm
talking
about...
in
the
context
of
this
case
we're
talking
about
political
association,
and
in
that
context,
no,
i
believe
that
any--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--that's...
no,
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
that's
not--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i'm
not
saying
they
wouldn't.
that's...
i
think
that's
a
different
case.
we're
not
talking
about
that
here.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
i'm
not.
no,
i'm
not
arguing
racial
bigotry,
i'm
arguing
for...
basically
for--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--well,
it's
not
part
of
this
case,
either,
and
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
that
again,
if
you
have
a
situation
where...
well,
let
me
backtrack
for
a
minute.
i
think
that
the
history
of
the
elrod,
branti,
and
rutan
decisions
as
such,
that
it
has
proved
to
be
unworkable
in
terms
of
how
it's
applied
in
specific
situations,
and
there
are--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i'm
familiar
with
it.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--i'm
familiar
with
it,
your
honor--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--yes,
and
i'm
not...
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
there
being
a
flood
of
litigation
arising
out
of
that
decree.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
it
doesn't.
there's
no
republican
mayor
in
chicago.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
nonetheless,
i
think
that
the
potential
is
there
not
only...
i
think
it's
obvious
that
it's
there
in
the
employer-employee
context.
it's
clearly
there
in
an
independent
contractor
context,
and
there
were
some...
there
were
questions
previously
about
line-drawing
in
an
independent
contractor
context.
i
don't
think
you
can
draw
a
line.
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
everybody
or
nobody
that
this
is
going
to
apply
to,
because--
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
--no.
mr.
gary
m.
feiereisel
well,
in
this
line
of
cases
with
elrod,
branti,
and
rutan,
that's
all
been
basically
lumped
together,
i
think.
hiring,
firing,
promotion,
transfer,
whatever,
you
can't
make
any
employment
decisions
unless
the
individual
involved,
or
who
the
decision
is
being
made
against,
falls
within
the
exception
to
those
cases.
that
scenario
has
created
a
lot
of
litigation.
it
has
created
inconsistent
results
between
different
courts,
and
i
think
that
that
will
lead
even
more...
or
it
will
evidence
itself
even
more
strongly
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
you
have
innumerable
more
independent
contractor
situations
than
you
do
employee
situations.
you
have
a
situation
where
the
administration
that's
in
power
should
not
have
to
run
the
risk
of
facing
lawsuits,
having
to
spend
money
on
lawsuits
in
this
kind
of
a
context.
you
have...
that's
why
there's
so
many
qualified
immunity
defenses
that
are
being
raised,
because
in
those
situations
the
administration
does
not
know,
or
the
public
official
involved,
is
being
dismissed
from
cases
because
they
are
not
able
to
tell
or
were
not
able
to
tell
from
past
decisions
whether
the
decision
they're
making
is
constitutionally
correct
or
incorrect,
and
i
think
that
is
only
going
to
get
multiplied
if
you
extend
the
same
first
amendment
rights
that
have
been
extended
to
employees
to
the
independent
contractors.
i've...
there
are
a
couple
of
other
arguments
i
wanted
to
make.
my
time's
running
out
so
i'm
not...
i'll...
they're
in
my
brief.
i
know
that
one
of
the
things
we
raised
is
that
if
the
court
decides
to...
or
before
the
court
decides
to
extend
rutan
to
this
situation,
i
think
that
there...
there
should
be
consideration
given
to
overruling
rutan
because
of
the
problems
raised
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
state
of
illinois,
the
officials.
in
summary,
it
is
our
position
that,
when
you're
in
an
independent
contractor
context,
their
first
amendment
rights
in
political
association
do
not...
or
can
be
infringed
because
they
are
entitled...
the
administration,
i
am
sorry,
is
entitled
to
rely
on
independent
contracts...
contractors,
i'm
sorry,
that
it
knows
supports
its
position,
its
administration,
its
program
because
that
is
the
safest
