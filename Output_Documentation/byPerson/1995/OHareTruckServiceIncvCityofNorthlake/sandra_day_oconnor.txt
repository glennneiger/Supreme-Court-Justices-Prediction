justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
the
opinion
in
o’hare
truck
service
versus
city
of
northlake
to
announce
for
justice
kennedy
who
is
absent
today.
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit.
it
is
an
opinion
that
raises
issues
that
have
parallels
to
those
raised
in
the
one
i
just
announced
board
of
commissioner
versus
umbehr.
the
petitioner
in
o’hare
truck
service
versus
city
of
northlake
is
a
man
named
john
gratzianna.
his
company
o’hare
truck
service
was
in
the
automobile
tolling
business
and
important
part
of
the
business
depended
on
referrals
from
the
city
of
northlake,
illinois.
for
at
least
30
years,
the
city
had
maintained
a
list
of
tolling
companies
which
they
have
acceptable
service.
when
the
police
received
the
tolling
request,
they
would
call
the
company
next
on
the
list.
according
to
o’hare’s
complaint,
o’hare
was
removed
from
the
list
when
gratzianna
refused
to
support
the
mayor
in
his
successful
re-election
campaign.
o’hare’s
proprietor
gratzianna
instead
supported
the
campaign
of
one
of
the
opponents
of
the
mayor.
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
the
complaint
was
dismissed
in
accord
with
seventh
circuit
precedents.
cases
from
this
court
such
as
elrod
versus
burns
and
branti
versus
finkel
protect
public
employees
from
discharge
based
on
their
political
affiliation
unless
that
affiliation
is
a
reasonable
requirement
for
the
job
in
question.
the
seventh
circuit
declined
to
extend
elrod
and
branti
to
the
protection
of
independent
contractors.
we
now
reverse
that
judgment.
gratzianna
was
targeted
with
a
specific
demand
for
political
support
and
on
his
refusal
the
city
terminated
the
relationship
that
based
on
longstanding
practice;
he
had
reason
to
believe
would
continue.
we
see
nothing
that
distinguishes
this
on
the
type
of
coercion
exercise
in
the
long
line
of
our
cases
holding
that
the
government
may
not
condition
public
employment
on
an
employee’s
exercise
of
his
or
her
first
amendment
rights.
we
see
no
reason
why
the
constitutional
claim
here
should
turn
on
the
distinction
between
employees
and
independent
contractors.
the
constitution
accords
government
officials
a
large
measure
of
freedom
as
they
exercise
discretion
adherent
in
making
decisions
by
the
contracting
of
goods
and
services
but
the
first
amendment
does
not
deny
independent
contractors
safeguards
for
exercising
rights
of
political
association
and
political
affiliation.
the
opinion
for
the
court
was
authored
by
justice
kennedy.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
the
cases
remanded.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
