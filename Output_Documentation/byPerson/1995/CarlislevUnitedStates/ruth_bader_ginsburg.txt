justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
christopherson,
the
origin
of
the
motion
for
directed
verdict,
it
was
just
that.
the
judge
told
the
jury
come
in
with
a
verdict,
and
then
that
was
eliminated,
that
formality
was
eliminated,
but
the
words
mean
what
they
say.
it
was
a
motion
to
direct
the
jury
to
come
in
with
such-and-such
a
verdict,
so
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
get
very
far
with
trying
to
say
that
the
first
sentence
is
broader
than
what
the
traditional
understanding
of
directed
verdict
is.
if
we
disagree
with
you,
and
if
we
say
that
section
(a)
applies
only
to
motions
before
the
jury
retires,
before
the
case
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
do
you
lose
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
christopherson,
as
far
as
rule
57
is
concerned,
this
really
isn't
an
area,
is
it,
where
it
would
be
appropriate
for
one
district
judge
to
act
one
way
and
another
district
judge
to
act
another
way?
i
thought
the
federal
rules
require
certain
uniformity,
and
where
they
don't
require
uniformity,
then
there's
scope
for
local
rules,
and
where
neither
requires
uniformity,
then
there's
discretion,
but
you
can't
be
arguing
that
judge
enslin
can
grant
a
motion
to
acquit
in
8
days,
whereas
judge
x
will
do
it
only
for
7.
they
can't
both
be
right.
either
district
judges
have
this
authority
or
they
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
interesting,
in
that
case
the
court
came
up
with
a
rule
when
you
deposit
the
paper
with
the
jailer,
so
it
wasn't
something
that
for
one
judge
it's
9
days,
for
another
judge...
there
was...
the
court
came
up
with
a
rule.
it
may
have
been
different
from
the
rule
that
was
written
into
the
federal
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
certainly
not
the
same
as
the
trial
judge...
you
made
a
distinction
in
the
brief
yourself.
here,
a
trial
judge
said,
i
would
give...
grant
the
motion
to
acquit,
and
yet
the
sixth
circuit
didn't,
apparently
must
have
found
the
evidence
sufficient--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
what
was
it...
remanded
for
sentencing,
not
for
doing
anything
with
the
verdict
any
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
engelmayer,
there's
one
concern
that
i
had
about
an
earlier
answer
you
gave.
you
said
the
judge
can
act
on
his
own
motion
within
the
7
days
because
he
may
have
made
a
mistake,
he
may
have
realized
he
made
a
mistake
in
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
as
a
typical
thing
they
do
let
it
go
to
the
jury
so
that
all
possibilities
are
preserved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right,
but
you
were...
you
recognized
the
possibility
of
a
judge's
own...
in
the
judge's
mind,
she
has
missed
something.
isn't
it
common
when
you
deal
with
appointed
counsel
to
do
just
what
was
suggested
before,
if
someone
doesn't
make
a
motion
to
suggest
that
the
district
judge
will
suggest,
counsel,
don't
you
want
to
make
a
motion?
do
we
make
no
distinction?
it
was
court-appointed
counsel
in
this
case,
was
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
make
no
distinction
between
the
slips
made
by
a
representative
that
the
state
has
provided
to
the
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
scope
of
the
district
judge's
authority
on
a
postverdict
motion?
say
a...
say
there's
a
2255
application
made
to
this
same
district
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
i'm
right,
though,
that
that
failed
here,
that
the
sixth
circuit
considered...
there
wasn't
only
one
question
raised
on
the
appeal
from
the
judgment,
was
there?
isn't
it
implicit
in
the
sixth
circuit
instruction
to
sentence,
that
they
had
considered
all
questions
relating
to
the
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's
assume
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed,
didn't
find
any
plain
error,
so
there
s
another
appeal
after
the
sentence--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
we're
left
with
what,
2255?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
had
raised
those
two
possibilities
as
discrete,
but
now
you're
saying
if
you
lose
one,
if
you
lose
the
plain
error
review
on
the
circuit,
you
can
forget
the
2255.
