mr.
james
a.
christopherson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
authority
of
a
district
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
district
court,
up
to
sentencing,
has
the
authority
to
make
a
decision
on
whether
or
not
the
evidence
against
the
detendant
was
sufficient
to
convict
him.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
limitation
on
the
ability
of
a
defendant
to
file
a
motion,
the
7-day
limitation
in
rule
29(c),
also
limits
the
court's
authority.
it's
our
position
that
the
rule
is
clear,
it's
concise,
and
that
it
gives
the
court
the
authority
to--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--it
is
not
sufficiently
clear,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
second
sentence
in
subparagraph
(a)
of
29
gives
the
court
the
authority
on
its
own
motion
to
rule
on
a
judgment
of
acquittal
based
upon
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
it's
actually,
i
think,
set
out
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
yes.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i
think
i
put
subparagraph
(c)
there
but
not
(a),
if
i'm...
it's
in
my
reply
brief,
also,
but
it's
in
the
government's
brief.
that
sentence,
which
is
in
mandatory
language,
indicated
that
the
court
shall,
gives
the
court
the
authority
to
order
a
judgment
of
acquittal
based
upon
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
after
the
evidence
on
either
side
is
closed.
that
sentence--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--subparagraph
(a),
the
second
sentence,
which
starts,
the
court
on
motion
of
a
defendant.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
well,
the
title
to
the
subpara...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
title
to
the
subparagraph
is
not
the
text,
and
this
court
should
only
obviously
look
to
the
title
if
there's
some
ambiguity.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
if
you
read...
i
disagree
for
this
reason.
if
you
read
the
first
sentence
of
subparagraph
(a),
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
motions
before
submission
to
a
jury.
the
third
sentence
of
subparagraph
(a)--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--no,
i'm
not
saying
they
have
nothing
to
do,
but
i
think
that's
a...
that's
a
general
statement
which
is
not
simply
limited
to
motions
before
submission
to
a
jury.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i
think
that's
true
in
99.9
percent
of
the
cases.
i
think
there
certainly--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--well,
i
mean,
it
can
be
submitted
to
a
jury
and
somebody
can
still
come
in
and
ask
for
a
directed
verdict.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
after
the
verdict.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
yes.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
well,
once
it's...
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is,
submission...
i
guess
you're
getting
into
the
definition
of
what
is
submission
to
the
jury.
i
mean,
there
could
be--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--theoretically,
a
case
could
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
and
it
could
be
before
a
verdict.
but
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--the
jury
could
be
out
deliberating,
i
guess
is
what
i'm
saying.
it
depends
on
how
you
define
submission
to
a
jury.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
it's
certainly
not
a
preferred
practice,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that's
a
possibility.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
no,
justice
kennedy,
and
my
position
is
first
of
all
that
the
second
sentence
of
rule
(a)
is
clear
and
gives
the
court
the
authority,
but
if
the
court
does
not
agree
with
that,
then
my
argument,
as
i
think
i
indicated
in
my
briefs,
that
there's
a
line
of
cases
by
this
court,
from
the
unique
circumstances
cases
which
were
thompson
and
harris
truck
line,
the
gaca
case
discussing
supervisory
power,
and
houston
v.
lack,
that
there
are
exceptions
that
may
allow
this
to
go
forward.
but
if
i
can
get
back
to
the
rule,
i
think
i
would
also
like
to
make
this
argument
under
(c).
if
you
read
the
first
sentence
of
(c),
it
talks
about
motions
which
are
made
or
renewed,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
second
sentence
of
(a),
it
talks
about
the
court
of
its
own
motion.
i
think
that's
a
distinction.
under
(c)
we're
talking
about
motions
made
or
renewed.
a
court
does
not
make
or
renew
a
motion.
sentence
two--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--up
to
the
time
of
sentencing,
yes.
there's
nothing
in
(c)
that
limits
the
judge.
there's
no
specific
language
in
(c)
that
says
the
judge
does
not
have
the
power
sua
sponte.
paragraph...
i
mean,
it's
the
second
sentence--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--i
think--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--i
think
the
judge
in
that
case,
if
you
follow
my
reading
of
the
rule,
could
simply
tell
the
court,
don't
accept
that
motion,
it's
untimely.
it's
the
exceptional
case,
and
remember
that
we're
talking
about
situations
where
the
judge
has
sat
through
the
trial,
and
so
the
judge
knows
what
happened.
it's
the
exceptional
case.
judge
enslin
in
this
case,
based
upon
the
transcript,
said
that
what
he
did
was
initially
in
august,
when
he
denied
the
motion,
he
wrote
two
separate
opinions
and
two
separate
orders,
and
he
said,
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
judicial
career
i've
ever
done
that.
then,
when
it
came
time
in
october
for
sentencing,
he
changed
his
mind,
and
it's
my
argument
that
you
can
enforce
the
rule
and
say
the
7
days
applies,
the
defendant
has
to
file
the
motion
by
7
days,
but
still
leave
that
authority
for
the
court.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i
think
this
court
could
construe
that
to
apply
to
the
7
days
required
when
defendant
files
a
motion,
but
again,
i
say
that,
under
rule
(c),
where
it
says
made
or
renewed,
that's
a
defendant's
motion,
so
45
limits...
it
could
limit
the
defendant's
motion,
but
not
the
court
on
its
own
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
no,
i
don't,
because
i,
you
know,
think
the
time
limits
can
constrain
defense
counsel,
and
i
think
there's
good
reasons
to
do
that,
but
i
think
the
rationale
is
you
want
the
court
to
do
what
judge
enslin
did
in
this
case,
and
that
is
give
considered
thought
to
this
and
even
rethink
his
position.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
well,
obviously,
i
mean,
you
have
to
go
to
sentencing
promptly,
and
the
court
would
lose
jurisdiction
after
sentencing,
so
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
do
that
for
that
long
a
period.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i
think
that's
potentially
possible.
i'm
not
here,
i
guess,
arguing
for
a
bright
line
saying
that
6
months
or
9
months,
but
obviously
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
it
only
happened
over
2
months,
and
sentencing
proceeded
promptly,
and
i
also
think,
if
you
look
at
the
rationale
in
u.s.
v.
smith,
which
is
the
case
relied
upon
by
the
government,
that
after
a
long
passage
of
time,
and
of
course
in
that
case,
that
was
after
appeal,
that
the
trial
judge
doesn't
remember
the
case,
that
just
doesn't
apply
here.
i
mean,
in
fact,
just
the
opposite.
if
you
read
the
transcript
of
that
october
hearing,
judge
enslin
is
saying,
i
agonized
over
this.
i
wrote
two
separate
opinions.
i
wrote
two
separate
orders.
i
mean,
he
was
thinking
about
this
very
conscientiously,
and
so
i
think
if
you
interpret
the
rule
in
that
manner,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
allow
him
to
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
okay.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
well,
i
think
what
i
would
argue,
your
honor,
is
that
when
you
read
that
in
the
entire
context
of
this
rule,
and
especially
the
second
sentence
of
paragraph
(a),
where
it
says
shall,
i
think
the
word
shall
is
a
very
strong
word
that
gives
the
court--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--okay.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
well,
then
i
think
that
first
of
all
we
still
have
the
first
sentence,
which
says
made
or
renewed,
and
i
believe
that
applies
to
a
defendant.
i
think
the
language,
on
such
motion,
perhaps
at
best
i
would
argue
is
ambiguous,
and
the
court
then
should
look
at
the
policies
under
rule
2
in
trying
to
interpret
exactly
what
that
sentence
in
rule
(c)
means,
and
the
policies
under
rule
2
are
fairness
of
administration,
and
trying
to
avoid
undue
delay
and
undue
cost.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
that's
correct.
that's
my--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--no,
i
don't...
because
i
don't
think
the
rule
clearly
states
that
the
judge
does
not
have
that
authority,
and
so
if
the
rules
does
not
state
that
and
is
ambiguous,
then
my
argument
is
you
have
to
look
at
rule
2.
that's
the
way
you
interpret
the
rest
of
the
rules,
and
i
think
when
you
do
that,
and
you're
talking
about
fairness
in
the
administration
of
justice,
and
you're
talking
about
avoiding
undue
cost
and
undue
delay,
that
clearly
those
policies
support
our
position
that
the
court
does
have
the
authority
up
to
the
time
of
sentencing
to
determine
whether
the
evidence--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--right.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
well,
i
think
the
last
sentence
of
rule
57
gives
the
court,
i
think,
fairly
broad
powers
also.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i
don't
know
if
that's
cited
in
the
briefs,
your
honor.
it's...
i'm
sorry,
it's
page
4(a),
the
government
has
pointed
out
to
me,
in
their
brief.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
the
rule
does
not
state
that
the
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
look
at
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
make
that
decision
prior
to
sentencing.
the
rule
is
not
that
specific,
and
so
i
don't
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
last
sentence
of
rule
57,
that
my
interpretation
of
rule
29
is
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
these
rules.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i
think
the
local
courts
could
adopt
rules,
given
the
fact
that
this
rule
is
ambiguous.
i
was--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--i
think
the
issue
you
raise
begs
the
question
of
what
is
not
provided
for
by
the
rules.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
your
argument
is
that
generally--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--well,
i'm...
i
guess
i'm
looking
at
it
more
specifically.
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
the
rule
does
not
say
that
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
or
authority
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
evidence
was
insufficient
prior
to
sentencing.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i
agree.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
but
again,
i
mean,
i
don't
believe
that
specific
issue
we
have
today
is
handled
by
the
rules,
and
you
have
to
get
back
to
what
the
standard
is
you're
going
to
use
to
interpret
the
rules.
rule
29--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--i
agree
with
that
statement.
i
think
the
question
i
was
arguing
before
was
whether
the
judges
in
different
districts
could
adopt
local
rules,
as
this
rule
is
currently
worded,
that
might
be
inconsistent.
obviously,
that
begs
the
second
part
of
my
que...
i
mean,
the
second
part
of
my
argument
here
whether
or
not
the
court
in
any
way
can
go
outside
that
rule,
but
i
think
if
you'd
follow
my
first
argument
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
rule,
yes,
i
think
it
should
be
consistent,
but
theoretically
i
think
local
district
courts
could
adopt
rules
the
way
it's
worded
right
now
that
might
be
inconsistent.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
absolutely,
i
agree
with
that,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that's
what
we'd
want
judges
to
do
if
they
have
doubt
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
i
think
that's
the
policy
this
court
should
try
to--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--my
argument
is,
it
doesn't
matter.
i
mean,
if--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--i
think
if
you
adopt
the
government's
position,
the
argument
is
no,
and
i
think
that's
an
intolerable
result,
because
if
you
look
at
the
language--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--well--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--i
mean--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case
where,
i
mean,
actually
what
happened
at
the
end
of
the
proofs
was
the
attorney
made
a
motion
saying
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
not
been
tied
to
the
conspiracy,
but
just
asked
that
the
statements
be
dismissed
and
didn't
ask
for,
you
know,
a
rule
29
motion,
i
think,
you
know,
that
there
was
an
issue
here
as
to
how
effective
that
counsel
was.
i
mean,
obviously--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--well,
but
i
don't
think
the
transcript
bears
that
out,
because
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
october
transcript...
i
mean,
the
judge
said
it's
the
first
time
he's
done
this
in
nearly
20
years
on
the
bench,
where
he's
written
two
separate
opinions,
two
separate
orders,
it
came
down,
and
he
finally
decided
one
way.
i
mean,
so
going
back
to
august,
he
was
obviously
deeply
split
on
this
issue,
and
it
wasn't
simply
looking
at
a
presentence
report
and
then
changing
it,
because
he
had
already...
because
he
had
made...
he
was
agonizing
over
this
long
before
that.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i'm
arguing,
i
think,
along
those
lines
in
the
alternative.
my
first
argument
is
that--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--rule
29
allows
this.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
but
there
are
a
long
line
of
cases
from
this
court,
the
last
one
being
houston
v.
lack,
where
this
court
has
found
a
basis
where
there
are
circumstances
such
as
exist
in
this
case
to
grant
relief.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i
take
the
position
that
the
inherent
authority
exists,
and
i
think
it's
similar
to--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--no.
it
has
to
be--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--well,
there's
two
lines
of
cases
from
this
court,
i
think.
the
first
cases
are
the
unique
circumstances
cases,
and
the
second
line
of
cases
are
the
cases
which
have
dealt
with
issues
where,
for
example,
prisoners
in
the
houston
v.
lack
case
were
unable
to
timely
file
their
notices.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
it
was
different
than
what
was
written
in
the
federal
rule,
and
of
course
then
the
federal
rule
was
changed
to
conform
with
that
decision.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
if
that's
the
ruling
of
houston
v.
lack,
then
i
would
suggest
that
same
rationale
applies
to
this
case,
in
that
the
court
could
do
the
same
to
rule
29
that
it
did
to
rule
4.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
i
don't
think
you
should
take
liberties
with
the
text.
i
think...
again,
the
way
i
read
the
sentence
two
of
subparagraph
(a),
and
i
know
some
of
you
may
disagree
with
me,
but
that's
clear,
and
i
don't
see
how
you--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--no.
no,
i--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--well,
again,
(c)
is
ambiguous.
it
does
not
prohibit
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case,
and
so
i
think
if
we
were
to
redraft
(c)
similar
to
the
way
4
was
redrafted
in
houston
v.
lack,
that
there
should
be
a
specific
statement
in
(c)
which
would
allow
the
court--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--i
wouldn't...
i
don't
know
if
i'd
draw
that
broad
a
rule,
but
i
guess
in
this
case
where
it
doesn't
prohibit
it,
and
when...
again,
i
think
(a)
does
talk
about
shall,
(c)--
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
--okay.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
okay.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
you
still
have
(c),
which
talks
about
made
or
renewed,
which
obviously
in
my
opinion
is
a
defendant's
made
or
renewed
motion,
so
now
you
have
a
rule
which
is
silent.
i
think
when
the
rule
is
silent...
i
mean,
you
can
make
the
argument
either
way,
and
so
if
you
look
to...
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
rule
2,
which
talks
about
interpreting
the
rule
in
fairness
to
the
administration
of
justice
and
to
avoid
undue
delay
and
undue
cost
and,
obviously,
in
our
opinion
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
have
to
go
through
appeal
or
collateral
proceedings
in
that
it's
not
deficient.
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
there
are
a
couple
of
points
i'd
like
to
make
justice
o'connor
asked
the
question,
well,
this
really
wasn't
sua
sponte
by
the
court.
in
fact,
this
was
by
a
motion,
but
i
think
procedurally
if
you
look
at
what
happened
in
this
case
the
motion
was
filed,
the
motion
was
denied.
there
was
no
motion
pending
in
front
of
the
court
when
the
judge
made
his
decision
in
october.
now,
it's
true
that
judge
enslin
back
in
august
had
written
two
separate
opinions
and
two
separate
orders,
and
then
just
changed
them
and
then
did...
on
the
order
does
say
it's
based
on
a
motion
by
the
defendant,
but
i
think
it's
clear
in
this
case
there
was
no
motion
pending,
and
the
judge
made
that
decision
sua
sponte.
mr.
james
a.
christopherson
he
denied
the
motion
in
august
and,
again,
in
the
transcript
he
said,
i
agonized
and
wrote
two
separate
opinions,
and
then
when
it
came
the
day
for
sentencing
he
called
the
counsel
in
and
on
the
record
explained
that
he
had
changed
his
mind.
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
raise
is
i
think,
in
looking
at
the
rule,
this
court
has
to
look
at
what
rule
is
going
to
be
used
to
construe
that
rule,
and
one
point
i'd
like
to
make
to
the
court
is
that
the
day
that
houston
v.
lack
was
decided
this
court
also
decided
the
torres
case.
in
that
case
the
court
indicated
that
in
construing
the
rules
they
should
be
construed
liberally
with
a
view
that
cases
should
be
decided
on
their
merits
as
opposed
to
on
procedure,
and
i
think
if
you
use
that
type
of
analysis
that
the
majority
used
in
the
torres
case,
apply
it
to
rule
29,
that
under
these
facts
the
court
should
have
the
power
to
consider
the
issue
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
prior
to
the
time
of
sentencing.
thank
you.
