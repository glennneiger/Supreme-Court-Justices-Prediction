justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
i'm
going
to
ask
your
opponent,
so
he
can
think
about
it
in
the
meantime,
too.
what
about
the
power
of
the
judge
to
act
on
his
own
motion
within
the
7-day
period?
what
does
the
rule...
how
does
the
rule
speak
to
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
nothing
in
the
rule
authorizes
the
judge
to
grant
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
the
first
6
days,
but
supposing
a
judge
is
concerned
that
there
really
is
no
evidence
at
all
here,
but
he
has
a
lousy
lawyer
in
front
of
him,
he
thinks
he
won't
get
around
to
filing
the
motion
until
10
days
later,
could
the
judge
take
care
of
the
situation
within
the
6
or
7-day
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
the
lawyer
isn't
available,
he's
in
the
hospital
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
he
without
power,
that's
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wait
a
minute,
may
i
just...
may
i
just...
i
hate
to
interrupt,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
you're...
what
if
he
didn't
do
it
sua
sponte
within
the
7
days?
could
he
do
it
so...
you
didn't
really
address
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
a
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you've--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
may
i
ask
you
to
return
before
the
time
expires
to
my
hypothetical?
i
still
don't
understand
where
it
is
that
you
find
authority
in
the
rule
for
the
judge
to
do
what
you
say
he
obviously
has
the
power
to
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
speak
to
the
judge's
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is...
but
you
would
agree,
xx
to
look
at
paragraph
(a)
to
find
the
authority
in
xx
is
that
right,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
some
of
us
were
inclined
to
say
well,
let's
not
even
look
at
(a),
and
you
kind
of
agree
with
your
opponent
that
we
should
look
at
(a).
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
acting
on
its
own
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
mr.--
--but
you
know,
there's
no...
could
i
just
finish
this
one
thought?
there's
no
prohibitory
language
in
(c),
and
there's
no
authorization
to
the
judge
to
act
on
its
own
motion
in
(c)
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
find
the...
i
want
to
be
sure,
you
would
find
the
authority
for
the
judge
to
act
on
his
own
arising
from
(a)
rather
than
from
any
inherent
power
in
the
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do
that,
why
is
it
constrained
by
the
same...
i
mean,
it's
not...
it
isn't
granted
by
(c),
and
why
is
it
constrained
by
(c),
the
time
in
which
the
judge
can
act
on
his
own?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
says,
i
forgot
to
ask
the
clerk
to
make
the
entry
but
i
told
myself
i
was
going
to
extend
the
time
a
few
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
do
you
rule
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
within
the
7
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
bending
the
rules
to
a
certain
extent.
you're
asking
us
to
draft
a...
the
rules
don't
say
anything
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
an
aberration,
but
it
is
rather
unusual
to
have
a
fellow
who
everybody
thinks
is
innocent
sitting
in
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean,
at
least
if
you
take
the
judge's
analysis
of
the
record,
which
we're
doing
for
purposes
of
this
appeal.
