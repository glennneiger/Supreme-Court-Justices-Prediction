my
goodness,
jackson
v.
virginia
is
not
the
same,
is
it,
as
whether
you're
deciding
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
100
percent,
it's
just
that?
in
other
words,
in
the
habeas
cases,
every
habeas
judge
is
supposed
to
go
and
look
at
all
of
the
state
determinations
of
guilt
and
see
if
they're...
would
survive
a
motion
of
directed
verdict
for
acquittal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
adequate
if,
in
fact,
then
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
go
and,
looking
for
plain
error,
apply
the
same
standard
to
the
evidence
as
otherwise?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
remember
ever
going
back
looking,
combing
through
records
where,
you
know,
there
are
close
questions
and
so
forth,
in
the
absence
of
a
motion,
where
they
say
you
have
to
find
plain
error.
i
thought
plain
error
is
pretty
narrow.
maybe
we
weren't
doing
it
right,
but
nobody
ever
complained
too
bitterly
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
sort
of
interesting,
because
the...
to
me,
is
that
we
used
to
get
hundreds...
i
mean,
that
was
the
most
common
thing.
the
evidence
doesn't
support
the
verdict.
i've
never
seen
so
many
claims
come
up
that
make
that,
all
the
time,
and
often
the
trials
are
very
complicated,
and
often
they
involve
unbelievable
numbers
of
witnesses
on
conspiracy,
and
this
person
says
this,
the
other
one
says
that,
and
is
what
the
government's
position
now
is
that
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
indeed,
in
district
courts
on
habeas,
that
it...
the
fact
that
the
person
didn't
make
the
motion
in
the
trial
court
for
a
directed
verdict
for
acquittal
is
irrelevant.
basically,
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts
are
supposed
to
go
through
all
those
records
and
review
the
same
way
they
would
do
it
if,
in
fact,
at
the
trial
court
level
somebody
had
made
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
and
the
district
judge
had
had
a
chance
to
pass
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
appropriate,
mandatory.
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--agree,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
these
things
are
never
plain.
they're
never
plain.
i
mean,
in
case
after
case
this
person
says,
a
little
shaded
this,
this
person
says,
a
little
shaded
that.
the
person
who
knows
about
it
is
the
trial
judge
who's
been
sitting
there.
a
court
of
appeals,
at
least
in
my
experience,
can't
really
know
what's
going
on
at
the
trial
and
who's
believable,
or
what
the
situation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
too
complicated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
my
question
does
not
turn
on
credibility
or
not
credibility.
i
just
notice
these
things
are
incredibly
complicated,
very
often,
and
the
trial
judge
as
a
practical
matter
is
in
a
far
better
position,
often,
to
decide
what's
going
on
than
a
court
of
appeals.
now,
maybe
the
legal
standard
written
down
in
terms
of
credibility
would
sound
the
same,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
in
practice
that
it's
the
same,
in
that
judges
normally
at
an
appeals
court
level
know
they
haven't
heard
all
the
evidence.
now
that
seems
to
me
to
make
a
difference.
now,
maybe
you're
saying
it
doesn't
make
a
difference.
