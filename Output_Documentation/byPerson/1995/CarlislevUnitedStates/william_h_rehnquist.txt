chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-9247,
charles
carlisle
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
christopherson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
you...
where
do
we
find
the
second
sentence
set
out
in
haec
verba
in
your
brief
or
somewhere
else
in
the
papers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
page
2
of
the
government's
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
whereabouts
on
page
2
are
you
reading
from,
page
2
of
the
government's
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
not
be
the
text,
but
it
gives
you
some
indication
of
what
category
of
cases
the
rule
is
addressed
to,
and
that
suggests
that
rule
(a)
is
addressed
to
motions
made
before
submission
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think...
you're
saying
that
the
statement
motions
for
a
directed
verdict
are
abolished,
and
motions
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
shall
be
used
in...
have
nothing
to
do
with
motions
before
submission
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
do
you
ordinarily
make
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict?
it's
always...
at
least
in
my
experience,
it
was
always
before
you
had...
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
tell
us
about
the.1
percent
of
the
cases
it's
not--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--no,
you
come
in
and
ask
for
a
judgment
n.o.v.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
where
else
do
you
find
this.1
percent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
think
there
would
be
a
struggle
over
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
case
could
be
submitted
to
the
jury...
tell
me
that
again.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
one
would
make
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
that
one
had
not
made
before
submission
to
the
jury.
you
would
make
it
while
the
jury
was
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
subsection
(b)
of
rule
45,
which
is
on...
which
justice
o'connor
mentioned,
which
is
page
2a
and
3a
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief,
where
it
says
the
court
may
not
extend
the
time
for
taking
any
action
to
rules
29,
et
cetera,
except
to
the
extent
and
under
the
conditions
stated
in
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
in
effect
you
certainly
have
a
strong
feeling
here,
from
reading
these
rules,
that
the
people
who
made
the
rules
thought
it
was
desirable
to
have
these
motions
made
promptly
and
disposed
of
promptly,
and
yet
in
your
view,
although
it
couldn't
be
done
by
motion,
a
judge
could
reopen
the
matter
at
any
time
before
sentencing,
even
though
there
were
weeks
afterwards.
doesn't
that
seem
rather
strange
in
the
light
of
these
very
close
time
limits
placed
on
the
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
he
gave
considered
thought
to
it
for
about
9
months?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
could
he
defer
sentencing
if
he
were
still
kind
of
turning
the
thing
over
in
his
mind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you
think
the
western
district
of
michigan
in
grand
rapids
could
have
a
rule
saying
that
the
judge
can
do
this
any
time
up
to
sentencing,
and
the
eastern
district
in
detroit
could
have
a
rule
saying
that
no,
you
have
to
comply
with
rule
29?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
could
also
say
that
the
district
judge
had
a
change
of
heart
about
the
new
trial
only
when
he
found
out
what
the
sentence
was
going
to
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
christopherson.
mr.
engelmayer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
a
sufficiency
claim
is
very
difficult
to
make
out
as
a
practical
matter,
isn't
it?
to
say
that
the
evidence
was
in...
all
inferences
have
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government,
all
questions
of
credibility
have
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government.
it's
not
like
a
motion
for
new
trial
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
engelmayer,
i
think
justice
breyer
and
i
may
disagree,
and
i'd
be
interested
to
know
the
government's
position
as
to
whether
the
district
judge,
in
passing
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
applies
the
same
standard
as
the
court
of...
or,
not
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
it's
my
opinion
that
a
district
judge
passing
on
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
applies
exactly
the
same
standard
as
the
court
of
appeals.
you
know,
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
verdict.
the
district
judge
doesn't
make
any
credibility
determinations
any
more
than
the
credib...
any
more
than
the
court
of
appeals
would.
now,
is
that
the
government's
position,
or
do
you
agree
that
the
district
court
somehow
makes
credibility
determinations
in
passing
on
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
there's
some
flaws
in
your
argument
that
a
judge
can
do...
act
on
his
own
within
7
days?
you're
just
opening
up
things
like
that,
whereas
if
you
require
it
to
be
done
by
a...
on
a
motion
of
counsel
or
not
at
all,
you
have
formal
records.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
the
government
take
a
position
like
this?
i
can
see
the
government
figuring
maybe
a
court
is
going
to
come
down
with
something
like
this,
because
they're
going
to
feel
sorry
for
a
defendant
whose
counsel
doesn't
make
the
motion,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it's
in
the
government's
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
engelmayer.
mr.
christopherson,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
if
he
denied
the
motion
one
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
christopherson.
the
case
is
submitted.
