mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
29(c)
provides
that
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
may
be
made
or
renewed
within
7
days
after
the
jury
is
discharged
or
within
such
further
time
as
the
court
may
fix
during
the
7-day
period.
our
position
is
that
when
a
defendant
makes
a
judgment,
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
outside
that
time
limit,
as
occurred
in
this
case,
the
district
court
lacks
authority
to
grant
that
motion.
we
also
take
the
position
that
the
district
court's
authority
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
its
own
motion
is
constrained
by
that
same
time
limit.
to
begin
with,
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
rule
29(c)
time
limit
is
dictated,
in
our
view,
by
the
plain
language
of
rule
45(b),
which
this
court
took
up
in
united
states
v.
robinson.
rule
45(b)
allows
district
courts
to
enlarge
most
time
limits
under
the
federal
rules
either
upon
a
showing
of
cause
or
after
the
time
limit
has
lapsed
upon
a
showing
of
excusable
neglect,
but
it
carves
out
a
specific
exempt...
exception
for
rule
29.
it
provides
that
the
court
may
not
take
any
time
for
taking...
extended
time
for
taking
any
action
under
rules
29,
33,
34,
and
35,
except
to
the
extent
and
under
the
circumstances
stated
in
those
rules,
and
in
robinson
this
court
stated
and
held
that
that
language
was,
in
the
court's
terms,
quite
plain
and
clear.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
that's
absolutely
right.
the
motion
was
at
all
times
untimely.
had
the
district
court
within
the
7
days
said
to
the
defendant,
you
may
make
a
motion
on
the
eighth
day,
he
would
have
complied
with
the
rule.
that
didn't
happen
here,
and
in
robinson
this
court
held
that,
except
where
the
specific
circumstances
set
forth
in
the
governing
rule,
in
this
case
29,
have
been
complied
with,
there's
otherwise
no
basis
for
extending
time
limits
under
the
rules.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
district
court,
of
course,
itself
has
the
power--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
think
the
text
of
the
rule
admits
of
no
excusable
neglect
exception,
and
whether
or
not
that
is
wise
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
rule
says
no...
that
it
is
not
subject
to
an
excusable
neglect
exception,
even
though
that's...
your
hypothetical
surely
would
be
excusable
neglect.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
absolutely.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
that's
absolutely
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
appeal,
whether
or
not
the
motion
was
timely
made
in
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
will
be
reviewing
de
novo
the
question
of
whether
the
jackson
v.
virginia
standards--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
guess
all
i'm
saying,
justice
breyer,
is
that
there's
an
adequate
recourse
on
it.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
our
position,
justice
breyer,
and
i
think
this
is
consistent
with
the
way
the
courts
of
appeals
have
addressed
the
issue
of
sufficiency
where
no
timely...
where
the
issue
is
not--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
think
the
court
on
appeal
obviously
is
going
to
have
to
be
guided
in
large
part
by
the
submissions
of
the
parties
as
to
what
the
evidence
at
trial
showed.
our
view,
though,
is
that
on
a
plain
error
review
from
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
evidence
in
the
court
of
appeals'
mind
clearly
showed...
clearly
was
insufficient
to
prove
all
the
elements
of
the
offense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
would
be...
fall
within
the
plain
error
standard.
in
other
words,
it
would
have
been
plain
error.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
justice
ginsburg,
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
sufficiency.
rather,
it
remanded
for
sentencing,
understanding
that
that
issue--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--that's
right,
but
the...
under
the
sixth
circuit's
remand,
following
sentencing
in
the
case,
the
defendant
would
have
been
free
to
raise
the
substance
of
a
sufficiency
claim
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
a
plain
error
standard
as
well
as
any
other
trial
errors,
as
well
as
any
objections
to
sentencing.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
that's
right.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
justice
breyer,
let
me
address
that
first
with
regard
to
direct
appeal
plain
error
and
then
with
regard
to
sufficiency,
if
i
might.
on
direct
appeal,
it
is
our
view
that
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
evidence
is
marshalled
properly
by
the
defendant
and
indicates
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
prove
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
it
would...
it
is
appropriate
to
reverse
because
it
was
plain
error
for
the
district
court,
within
the
proper
time
limits,
not
to
sua
sponte
dismiss
the...
overturn
the
conviction
for
insufficient
evidence.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
mandatory.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
absolutely.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
and
i
was
going
to
get
to
that,
and
i'd
like
to
turn
in
a
moment,
if
i
may,
just
to
the
text
of
the
rule,
because
i...
the
answer
to
your
hypothetical
would
be
yes,
the
district
court
does
have
the
power
under
rule
29(c),
in
our
view,
to
act
within
the
7
days
after
the
verdict
to
grant
the
judgment
of
acquittal,
but--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--on
its
own
motion,
absolutely,
and
i'd
like,
if
i
may
in
just--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--a
moment
to
turn
to
the
text
of
that.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
yes,
it
would
be.
that
was
what
the
plain
error
standard
means,
that
it
would
have
been
plain
error
for
the
district
court
not
to
have
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
i
think
the
source
of
the
authority
is
that
the
lack
of
sufficient
evidence
is
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
that's
right,
and
it's
plain
error
if
the
district
court--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--allows
on
its
watch
an
insufficient
case
to
result
in
a
verdict
and
does
not
overturn--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--much
as
it
would
be
for
other
abuses
that
could
occur
at
trial,
such
as
prosecutorial
misconduct,
for
example.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
justice
breyer--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--the
defendant
pays
a
price
there
for
not
having
properly
raised
this
below
and
perhaps
obtained
a
more
careful,
thoughtful
discussion
from
the
district
court.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
let
me
address
that
in
two
steps.
first
of
all,
the
claim
in
this
case
is
wrong.
the
citation
that
petitioner
has
referred
to
in
his
claim
that
is
new
law
is
a
sentencing
guidelines
case
called
jenkins.
it
simply
addresses
the
issue
of
how
one
goes
about
determining
what
quantity
of
drugs
are
attributable
to
a
defendant
for
calculating
mandatory
minimums.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
sufficiency,
and
i
think
that's
clear
from
the
oral
discussion,
which
is
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix,
that
the
district
court
goes
through.
but
more
generally,
even
if
there
is
a
change
of
law
outside
the
time
limit
set
by
rule
29(c),
the
rule
simply
does
not
authorize
a
district
court
to
revisit
the
issue,
to
open
up
the
issue
on
sufficiency
outside
that
time
limit.
now,
there
is
a
different
recourse
in
the
rules.
under
rule
48(a),
the
government
is
authorized
to
move
to
dismiss
an
indictment,
and
after
trial
has
commenced
that
must
be
with
the
consent
of
the
defendant.
if,
let
us
say,
a
intervening
supreme
court
decision
came
down
that
made
clear
that
under
new
standards
the
evidence
at
trial
was
clearly
insufficient,
a
decision
like
mcnalley
or
ratzlaf,
or
something
like
that,
the
government
would
be
perfectly
free,
and
a
responsible
government
hopefully
would
take
action--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--there
actually
is
a
circuit
split,
justice
scalia,
where
the
issue
is
not
raised
below
as
to
which
law
to
apply
under
a
plain
error
standard,
but
where
it
was
preserved,
there's
no
question
that
you
would
be
applying
the
new
law.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
what
you
stated
is
our
position.
the
only
deference
that
is
due
is
to
the
jury's
verdict,
and
that
is
under
the
jackson
v.
virginia
standard
that
all
credibility
findings
must
be
construed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
a
defendant
obviously
gets
a
real
advantage
if
his
counsel
is
savvy
enough
to
make
an
intelligent
motion
in
the
district
court.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
well,
i
think
what
i'm
saying
in
the
same
practical
spirit
in
which
your
question
was
phrased
is
that
it
does,
as
a
practical
matter,
make
it
a...
put
the
defendant
on
much
more
of
an
uphill
road
in
order
to
establish
insufficiency
in
the
court
of
appeals
than
in
the
district
court,
and
that
is
the
price
the
defendant
pays
for
not
having
made
the
motion.
if
the
district
court,
however,
out
of
time
suddenly
has
the
revelation
that
maybe
there
was
something
insufficient
about
the
evidence,
i
suppose
there's
nothing
that
would
prevent
the
district
court
from
making
those
views
known,
perhaps
in
the
context
of
granting
bail
pending
appeal,
or
something
like
that.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
is
conceivable
that
in
a
sufficiency
analysis
one
might,
in
a
very
odd
case,
turn
to
the
credibility
of
a
witness,
but
only
based
on
objective
facts
at
trial.
for
example,
if
a
witness
is
contradicted
by
a
videotape,
let
us
say,
that
is
something
that
the
court
of
appeals
perhaps
would
be
able
to
review,
and
a
district
court
would
be
in
the
same
position,
but
in
the
more
impressionistic
sense
that
we
think
of
credibility,
i
don't
think
the
district
court
has
any
more
discretion
than
the
court
of
appeals
to
turn
to
that
issue.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
right.
rule
29(c)
attaches
a
time
limit,
justice
stevens,
to
what
it
terms
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
our
position--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--well,
i
think
it's
a
general
term,
unlike
rule
29(a),
which
specifically
identifies
the
two
movants.
in
other
words
it
says,
the
defendant's
motion,
and
then
it
also
says,
the
court
on
its
own
motion.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
so
our
view
is
that
the
general
term,
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
in
29(c)
properly
encompasses
both
of
the
previous
types
of
motion,
defendant's
and
the
court's,
that
are
listed
in
29(a),
and
as
a
result
the
court
is
bound
by
the
same
7-day
deadline.
i'd
make...
i--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
think...
i
think--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--well,
i
think
my
opponent
suggests
that
there
is
no
temporal
aspect,
temporal
limitation
to
(a)
in
that
the
text
of
the...
the
clear
text,
the
clear
headline
of
(a)
which
says,
before
verdict,
is
irrelevant.
that,
by
the
way,
is
inconsistent
with
authority
from
this
court,
including
most
recently
ins
v.
national
center
for
immigrants'
rights,
to
the
effect
that
the
court
does
and
can
look
to
the
title
of
an
enactment
in
determining
its
meaning.
but
more
generally,
we
would
find
(a)
relevant
in
the
sense
that
(a)
identifies
two
specific
types
of
motion--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--and
(c)
is
a
general
term,
and
if--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--right,
but
it's
a
general
term.
we
think
it's
best
read
that
way.
the
alternative
is--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--we
would
find
the
authority
for
the
judge
to
act
on
his
own
to
arise
in
(c)
under
the
term,
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
and
we
would
find...
we
would
help
give
meaning
to
the
(c)
term,
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
from
the
language
in
(a)
where
two
types
of
motions
is
listed,
and
one
of
those
is,
and
i
quote,
on
its
own
motion,
referring
to
the
court.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
and
i
would
point
out
that
that
is
a
more
favorable
reading
to
the
district
court
than
the
alternative,
where
there
is
a
strong
negative
implication
that
the
court
has
no
authority
after
the
verdict
at
all
because
(a)
affirmatively
sets
out
the
authority
in
the
preverdict
phase.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
strictly
speaking,
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
our
reading
would
be,
rather,
that
the
term
motion,
not
being
subject
in
either
of
those
sentences
to
any
limiting
language,
applies
to
both
types
of
motion
set
forth
in
(a),
and
i
think
there's
actually
an
interesting
analogue
under
the
federal
rules,
and--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
don't,
but
i
think
it
may
just
be
that--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--it
may
be
that
it
is...
but
i
don't
think
it
may
be...
it
may
not
be
a--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--right.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
let
me
try...
let
me
give
you
the
analogue,
because
i
think
it
actually
may
help
to
answer
this
question.
in
rules...
and
i
apologize
in
advance
that
this
was
not
in
the
brief.
it's
something
that
came
up
in
the
course
of
preparing
for
this
argument.
in
rules
33
and
34,
those
rules
were
initially
read
simply,
the
court
may
grant
either
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
a
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment.
there
was
no
limiting
language
attached.
after
this
court's
decision
in
smith,
where
it
was
pointed
out...
where
the
court
pointed
out
you
could
have
a
double
jeopardy
problem
if
the
court
were
authorizing
a
new
trial
without
the
defendant
having
sought
or
consented
to
that
relief,
the
framers
of
the
rule
in
1966
added
the
limiting
language,
on
motion
of
the
defendant,
and
that
would
seem
to
us
to
be
the
terms
that
the
rules
use,
as
they
do
in
29(a),
when
they
want
to
denote
specifically
that
a
motion
must
be
made
by
the
defendant
as
opposed
to
sua
sponte.
when
there
is
a
more
general
term,
such
as
motion,
that
is
used,
it
seems
to
us
that,
particularly
in
light
of
the
antecedent
reference
in
(a)
to
both
types
of
motion,
it's
an
umbrella
word.
i
think
that's
also
confirmed
by
29(d).
29(d)
says,
if
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
after
verdict
of
guilty
under
this
rule
is
granted,
the
court
may
order
a...
may
make
a
conditional
finding
as
to
the
propriety
of
a
new
trial
depending
on
what
happens
on
appeal.
there's
no
reason--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--or
for
another
reason,
if
i
may,
justice
ginsburg,
which
is
that
the
court
may
have
wished
to
preserve
the
government's
right
to
appeal
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
a
conviction
whereas
had--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--right.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
yes,
it
was.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
this
rule
makes
no
distinction,
and
the
text
of
the
rule,
i
think,
governs,
but
your
point
that
a
court
can
informally
prod
a
defendant's
counsel
as
the
time
is
running
to
make
such
a
motion
is
certainly
a
correct
one.
i'm
sure
it
accords
with
practice
in
many
courts.
the
alternative
situation,
which
is
the
one
the
court
addressed
in
smith,
though,
would
be
created
by
the
other
way
of
looking
at
the
problem,
which
is,
if
the
court
was
to
have
inherent
sua
sponte
authority
that
lasted
after
the
defendant's
right
to
move
had
expired,
you
would
have
this
undesirable
consequence
of
a
defendant
through
proxies,
making
informal
entreaties
to
the
court
through
friends
or
counsel
asking
it
to
enter
relief
that
the
defendant
could
not
formally
ask
for,
otherwise
that
motion
would
be
time-barred.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
oh,
i--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
certainly
agree
with
that.
my
point
was
more
that
the
way
that
the
federal
rules,
and
29,
33,
and
34
and
35
are
something
of
a
package
under
45(b),
the
way
they
choose
to
limit
who
may
make
a
motion
is,
to
the
defendant
is
to
add
after
the
expression,
on
motion
of
a
defendant...
that
was
what
was
added
in
1966.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
and
the
court's
powers
are
greater,
justice
kennedy,
in
that,
unlike
in
the
new
trial
context
the
court
does,
in
our
view,
under
29(c)
have
the
power
to
order
a
judgment
of
acquittal
following
the
verdict,
even
if
the
defendant
has
not
asked
for
that
relief.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
it
just
so
happens,
though
that
that,
the
time
limit
that
the
court
is
constrained
by
is
the
same
7-day,
unless
timely
extended,
time
limit
that
the
defendant
is
constrained
by
in
rule
29(c).
if
i
may
just
turn
to
the
policies
that
are
served
by
the
rule--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--if
one
construes
in
(c)
the
expression,
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
to
include
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
court's
own...
on
the
court's
initiative,
which
is
a
type
of
motion
that
is
adverted
to
in
(a),
then
such
a
motion
on
the
court's
own
initiative
must
be
made
with
7
days
after
the
jury
is
discharged,
or
within
time
extended
afterwards.
so,
for
example,
the
court
might
say
several
days
after
a
verdict,
i'm
troubled,
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
evidence--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--that
would...
i
think
would
really
get
more
towards
the
formality
of
what
constitutes
a
motion,
i
would
think.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
i
think
the
judge
would
have
to
put
something
on
the
record
in
a
timely
fashion--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--because
otherwise--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
we
might
well
require
that
the
judge
put
on
the
record,
say,
after
a
verdict
that
i'm
troubled
by
the
close
nature
of
the
sufficiency
here,
and
i'm
going
to
reserve
to
myself
the
right
to
enter
judgement
of
acquittal
up
through
sentencing,
or
whatnot,
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
any
problem.
all
the
court
would
need
to
do
would
be
to
note
that
in
the
transcript
for
the
parties
or
in
some
formal
correspondence
or
some
such.
i
think
there's
little
focus--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--well,
it
says
on
a...
if
the
court
may
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--if
the
court
can
make
its
own
motion
before
the
verdict,
i
don't
see
why
it
couldn't
make
it
afterwards.
of
course,
as--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
think
it's
the
correct
reading
of
the
rule,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
alternative,
of
course,
would
simply
be
for
the
court,
if
it
was
stripped
of
power
after
the
verdict,
to
call
up
defense
counsel
and
say,
you
might
think
of
coming
down
to
my
courtroom
within
the
next
7
days
and
making...
making
such
a
motion
yourself,
with
the
same
effect.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
yes,
and--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--and
in
the
typical
case--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
think
the
whole
case
is
an
aberration
in
the
sense
that
the
overwhelming...
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
these
motions
are
made--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--well,
it's
not
everybody
who
thinks
he's
innocent.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
we
the
government
believe
the
evidence
was
sufficient.
if
we
felt
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
we
certainly
would
be
empowered,
under
rule
48(a),
to
trigger
the
process
of
getting
the
indictment
dismissed,
but
that's
not
the
case,
and
as
a
result,
this
is
something
that
is
going
to
have
to
be
taken
up
either,
depending
on
who
prevails
below
in
the
court
of
appeals,
with
the
government
or
the
defendant
appealing.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
the
district
judge
realistically,
because
of
the
theory
of
plain
error
which
i've
set
out
earlier,
and
we're
not
aware,
by
the
way,
of
any
court
of
appeals
that
has
ever
held
that
the
plain
error
standard
was
decisive
on
a
sufficiency
claim
that
the
nature
of
the
standard
mattered,
realistically
a
district
court
will
almost
never
have
to
get
to
a
2255
motion,
because
one
way
or
the
other,
plain
error
analysis
on
the
sufficiency
question
on
direct
appeal
should
dispose
of
it.
in
theory--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--not
in
this
case.
remember
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
not
yet
been
sentenced
and
as
a
result,
after
the
defendant
would
be
sentenced
after
the
remand,
the
defendant
would
have
the
right
to
file
time--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--right.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
and
the
2255
would
fail
under
any
theory,
because
sufficiency
will
have
been
raised
and
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
would
fail
to
show
prejudice
because
there
would
be
a
legal
sufficiency,
and
therefore
any
timing
mess-up
by
the
lawyer
would
have
been,
in
effect,
harmless
error,
so--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--except
in
the
highly
exceptional
case,
justice
ginsburg,
where
the
existence
of
reasonable
doubt
was
so
much
in
equipoise
that
maybe
the
plain
error
standard
was
dispositive,
and
therefore,
except
in
that
situation
there
would
be...
it
would
be
duplicative
to
raise
an
ineffective
assistance
claim.
in
that
rare
situation,
i
suppose,
a
defendant
could
come
back
and
say,
but
for
the
plain
error
standard,
i
would
have
prevailed
on
appeal,
and
it
was
only
because
of
my
counsel's
lapse
that
the
plain
xx
standard
vound
up
being
used
on
appeal,
ergo
i
should
have
a
good
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel
claim.
i
really
don't
think
that
that...
we're
ever
going
to
get
to
that
stage
in
this
case
or
others
like
it.
finally,
it's
just
important
just
to
point
out
the
purposes
of
this
rule,
that
they're
to
expedite
the
termination
of
district
court
review
to
make
sure
that,
for
example,
the...
that
there
aren't
eleventh
hour
motions
made
raising
sufficiency
just
before
sentencing
that
puts
off
sentencing.
it
helps
to
ensure
that,
if
the
district
court
is
going
to
be
tossing
out
a
conviction
based
on
insufficiency,
that
that
be
done
sufficiently
in
advance
of
sentencing
that
the
court,
the
probation
office,
the
defendant,
and
the
prosecutor
don't
waste
time
going
through
the
needless
exercise
of
preparing
for
sentencing.
those
interests
are
very
much
furthered
by
the
barrier,
the
7-day
barrier
applying
to
the
district
court
as
well
as
to
the
defendant.
now,
it's
true
that
the
rule
obviously
doesn't
impose
any
time
limit
on
whether
the
motion
has
to
be
resolved.
that's
because...
thank
you.
