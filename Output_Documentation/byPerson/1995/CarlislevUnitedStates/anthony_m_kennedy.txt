justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
in
order
to
make
that
argument,
you
have
to
ignore
the
title
of
the
paragraph,
of
the
subparagraph,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you're...
are
you
saying
that
it's
just
implicit
in
29(c)
that
the
judge
has
at
any
time
the
authority
sua
sponte
to
enter
the
judgment
of
acquittal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you're
saying
that
the
judge
has
authority...
i
won't
say
inherent
authority...
authority
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
rule
29.
he's
not
limited
by
rule
29.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
again
takes
you
away
from
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
absent
the
adoption
of
rules
of
the
court
that
would
prohibit
this
late
consideration,
i
take
it
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
judge
not
to
sua
sponte
consider
a
motion
for
acquittal
if
he
had
doubts.
he
couldn't
say,
before
sentencing,
now,
i
have
some
real
doubts
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
here,
but
you
didn't
file
a
motion,
and
i'm
just
going
to
exercise
my
discretion
not
to
think
about
that.
that's
a
very
strange
hypothetical,
but
i
take
it
that
in
your
view
he
is
mandated
to
make
that
consideration
and
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal
if
he
thinks
the
evidence,
or
she
thinks
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
if
the
attorney
is
on
his
way
to
the
court
and
is
abducted,
or
has
a
heart
attack,
and
misses
the
filing
deadline
by
a
few
hours?
what
can
the
judge
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
i'm
assuming
that
the
7
days
expires.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
on
the
eighth
day,
as
was
alleged
to
have
happened
in
this
case,
there's
a
new
opinion
from
the
court
of
appeals
indicating
that
it
was
clear
error
to
introduce
certain
testimony,
and
without
that
testimony
the
verdict
simply
can't
stand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
wasn't
clear
where
you
went
with
your
explanation
to
us
about
rules
33
and
34.
the
double
jeopardy
problem
is
not
present
with
a
motion
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--with
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
i...
that's
a
very
interesting
argument,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
doesn't
work
against
you,
because
in
this
case
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
problem,
and
so
the
court's
power
to
enter
the
acquittal
should
be
greater,
and
the
rules
may
recognize
that,
arguably,
by
this
silence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
