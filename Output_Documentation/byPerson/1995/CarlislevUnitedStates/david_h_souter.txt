justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
christopherson,
i
understood
that
you
would
answer
justice
stevens'
question
by
saying
yes,
he
may
raise
this
on
his
own
motion,
and
in
fact
i
understood
that
you
would
have
answered
justice
ginsburg's
question
yes,
that
judge
x
can
decide
to
do
it
within
9
days,
whereas
judge
y
says
no,
i
will
only
do
it
within
7,
and
that
in
each
instance
your
reason
would
be
an
inherent
article
iii
power
which
was
independent
of
the
rules.
do
i
understand
you
to
take
that
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
we
do
in
the
case
in
which
there
is
a
rule
which
specifically
addresses
it,
and
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
you
lose
on
the
first
point
and
we
say
7
days
means
7
days,
and
that's
it,
and
whatever
the
judge
can
do,
he
can't
do
anything
outside
of
7
days,
and
so
we're
in
the
situation
that
we
are
in
this
case.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the...
that
when
there
is
a
direct
conflict
between
the
purported
act
based
on
inherent
authority,
and
the
rule
which
would
limit
the
judge
and
preclude
the
judge
from
taking
that
conduct,
that
the
inherent
authority
always
wins,
and
that
the
rule
is
defeasible,
given
an
exercise
of
that
inherent
authority?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
always
trump
the
rule
if
there's
a
conflict
between
what
the
judge
wishes
to
do
with
that
authority
and
the
content
or
the
provision
of
the
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
do
we
know
which
is
which?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
word
do
we
turn
into
rubber
here?
i
mean,
what's
your
candidate?
[laughter]
it's
one
thing
for
us
to
take
liberties
with
the
text
here,
it's
another
thing
to
let
the
district
judge
take
liberties
with
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
subparagraph
(a)
is
out,
are
you
out
on
this
second
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
what
is
the
malleable
language
in
(c)
which
supposedly
is
going
to
be
flexible
enough
to
give
way
to
this
inherent
power?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
rule
is,
whenever
the
rule
does
not
specifically
prohibit
the
court
from
doing
something,
it
may
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
forget
(a).
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
an
(a)
man
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
assume
i've
got
to
decide
this
without
(a).
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
it
also
obligated
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
what's
the
source
of
the
obligation,
is
what
i
want
to
know?
it's
not
the
rule.
and
what's
the
source
of
the
authority?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
does
not
depend
on
the
rule.
that
is
an
obligation
inherent
in
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
power.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
engelmayer,
may
i
ask
you
about
the
possibility
of
a
theoretical
difference,
and
i
mean,
i
understand
your
answer
to
say
that
there
isn't
this
difference,
but
wouldn't
it
be
possible
for
the
district
judge,
ruling
on
a
motion
made
within
the
time,
to
say,
no...
the
conviction
depends
upon
acceptance
of
the
testimony
of
x.--
no
reasonable
jury
could
find
x
credible
on
the
crucial
evidence,
and
therefore
i
will
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
or...
yes...
whereas
a
court
of
appeals
could
not
make
that
credibility
determination,
as
i
understand
it.
isn't
that
theoretical
difference
possible?
