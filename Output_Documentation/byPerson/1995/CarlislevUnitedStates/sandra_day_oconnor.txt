well,
the
rule
is
clear.
it
imposes
the
7-day
limit,
and
rule
45
says
that
the
court
may
not
extend
the
time
for
taking
any
action
under
rule
29,
except
to
the
extent
and
under
the
conditions
stated
therein,
and
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
sufficiently
clear
that
there's
an
absolute
7-day
limit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
doesn't
rule
57
say
in
all
cases
not
provided
for
by
rule,
the
district
judge
may
regulate
their
practice,
and
so
forth,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
that
in
this
case
it
is
provided
for
by
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
in
houston
v.
lack,
the
court
did
not
rely
on
some
inherent
power
of
the
judge
to
ignore
the
rule.
it
redefined
what
filing
meant,
and
that
was
how
it
reached
the
result
it
did
in
houston
v.
lack,
so
i
don't
think
you
have
a
lot
of
support
in
our
cases,
at
least
in
the
recent
cases,
for
just
saying
there's
some
inherent
power
of
the
judge,
no
matter
what
the
rule
says.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
engelmayer,
two
questions.
first
of
all,
this
case,
i
take
it,
does
not
require
us
to
decide
this
matter
of
what
a
judge
can
do,
sua
sponte.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
was
a
motion
made
by
the
defendant
that
was
late.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
second
question.
subsection
(c)
possibly
does
distinguish
between
motions
by
defendants
and
the
court's
own
motion,
where
it
says,
if
a
verdict
of
guilty
is
returned,
the
court
may
on
such
motion,
referring
back
to
the
motion
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
the
first
sentence,
and
then
the
next
sentence,
if
no
verdict
is
returned,
the
court
may
enter
judgment
of
acquittal,
not
referring
to
motion.
now,
conceivably
those
two
phrases
indicate
some
different
role
for
the
defendant
and
the
court,
sua
sponte.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
don't
many
judges
ask,
just
as
a
matter
of
course
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
is
there
a
motion
going
to
be
filed
under
rule
29?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
they
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
this
is
an
aberration,
this
thing.
