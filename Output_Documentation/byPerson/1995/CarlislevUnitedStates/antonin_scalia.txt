justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
make
much
sense
to
limit
the
motions
to
7
days,
so
i
mean,
what
do
you...
you
just
come
in
10
days
later
and
say,
your
honor,
i'm
not
making
a
motion,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
you
on
your
own
accord
would
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
really
think
the
rule
is
that
silly?
you
don't
make...
you
can't
make
a
motion
after
7
days,
but
you
can
ask
the
judge
to
use
his
inherent
authority
to
do
this
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
christopherson,
come...
walk
through
subsection
(c)
with
me.
it's
on,
what,
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
judge
entering
such
an
order
on
his
own
without
a
motion,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
does.
the
second
sentence
says,
if
a
verdict
of
guilty
is
returned,
the
court
may,
on
such
motion,
set
aside
the
verdict
and
enter
judgment
of
acquittal,
but
read
the
next
sentence.
if
no
verdict
is
returned,
the
court
may...
and
it
notably
leaves
out,
on
such
motion.
if
no
verdict
is
returned,
the
court
may
enter
judgment
of
acquittal,
period.
it
seems
to
me
what
it's
saying
is,
when
no
verdict
is
returned,
the
court
may
enter
judgment
of
acquittal
on
motion
or
on
its
own,
whereas,
if
a
verdict
of
guilty
is
returned,
it
may
only
on
such
motion...
that
is,
a
motion
filed
within
7
days...
enter
judgment
of
acquittal.
what
is
your
explanation
for
the...
for
leaving
out,
on
such
motion,
from
the
third
sentence
of
(c)?
justice
antonin
scalia
(a)...
i
don't
think
(a)
relates
here.
you're
not
going
to
argue
(a).
let's
assume
you
have
to
hobble
along
without
(a)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
my
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that?
you
say...
unless
your
position
is
that
the
courts
have
all
powers
that
are
not
specifically
excluded
by
the
rules,
unless
that's
your
position,
where
in
the
rules
does
it
say,
other
than
subsection
(a),
which
i
don't
agree
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
in
the
rules
does
it
say
that
the
court
has
this
power,
without
motion,
to
set
aside
a
jury
verdict?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
interpreted
the
last
sentence
of
rule
57
the
way
you
want
us
to,
namely
it
has
to
conflict
with
a
particular
disposition
of
the
rules,
you
wouldn't
need
the
first
phrase,
in
all
cases
not
provided
for
by
rule.
what
it
says
is,
in
all
cases
not
provided.
that
means
when
the
general
subject
has
not
been
provided
for
by
rule,
magistrate
judges
may
regulate
their
practice
in
any
manner
not
inconsistent
with
these
rules.
the
way
you...
the
way
you're
interpreting
it,
you
do
not
need
the
preliminary
phrase.
you're
just
saying
the
district
judges
are
not
regulating
their
practice
here
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
these
rules,
and
therefore
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
gives
a
meaning
to
that
phrase.
how
does
your
argument
give
a
meaning
to
that
phrase?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
quite
right,
and
if
it
did
say
that,
then
to
act
otherwise
would
be
to
act
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
these
rules,
and
you
would
be
violating
the
last
half
of
their
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
only...
you
only
get
to
the
last
half
of
the
sentence
if
you
pass
the
first
part,
which
says,
in
all
cases
not
provided
for
by
rule,
and
i
think
that
refers
to
subjects
not
handled
by
the
rules,
such
as
the
subject
of
when...
the
subject
of
setting
aside
a
jury
verdict,
which
is
handled
by
the
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
judge
might
have
to
say,
counsel,
the
court
will
entertain
a
motion
to
set
aside
the
jury
verdict.
i
mean,
that
wouldn't
be
the
end
of
the
world,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
hasn't
extended
the
time
for
a
motion
here.
it
hasn't
extended
any
time
limit
that's
set
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
an
appeal
would
still
lie.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
jury
verdict,
right?
you
get
exactly
the
same
inquiry
on
appeal
as
you
do
from
the
district
judge
on
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
obligation
was
not
to
allow
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
even
if
it
didn't,
the
new
law
would
certainly
have
to
be
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
appeal,
wouldn't
it,
in
deciding
whether
the
case
should
have
ever
gone
to
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
we
get
to
analogues,
just
tell
me
why
it
says,
may
on
such
motion
in
one
sentence,
and
conspicuously
does
not
say
on
such
motion
in
the
next
sentence.
do
you
have
any
explanation
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
quite
obvious
and
conspicuous.
if
a
verdict
of
guilty
is
returned,
the
court
may
on
such
motion
set
aside
the
verdict--
--where
are
you
reading
from?
(c),
the
second
and
third
sentences
of
(c).
if
a
verdict
of
guilty...
the
court
may
on
such
motion
set
aside
the
verdict
and
enter
judgment
of
acquittal.
if
no
verdict
is
returned,
the
court
may
enter
judgment
of
acquittal.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
sticks
out
like
that,
and
you
say
there's
no
explanation
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
say
that
motion
means
on
the
court's
own
motion,
i
mean,
you
can
make
up
all
sorts
of
things.
[laughter]
whatever
the
court,
you
know,
speculates
in
oral
conversation
with
counsel
can
be
deemed
to
be
an
expression
of
the
court's
own
motion.
i
mean,
i
guess
you...
you
know,
you
could
write
something
that
way.
i
certainly
wouldn't.
