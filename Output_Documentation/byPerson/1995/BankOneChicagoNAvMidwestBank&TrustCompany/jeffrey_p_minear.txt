mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
civil
liability
provisions
of
the
efa
act
indicate
that
congress
incended
state
and
federal
courts
to
have
jurisdiction
over
both
depositor
and
interbank
claims.
section
4010(d)
expressly
provides
that
federal
district
courts
and
other
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
may
hear
liability
claims,
and
that
jurisdictional
provision
draws
no
distinction
between
depositor
claims
and
interbank
claims.
section
4010
does
create
two
different
causes
of
action.
subsection
(a)
establishes
rules
that
apply
to
depositor
claims,
while
subsection
(f)
authorizes
the
board
to
promulgate
or
establish
rules
that
apply
to
interbank
claims,
but
that
distinction
makes
no
difference
with
regard
to
federal
jurisdiction.
both
subsections
create
a
legal
right
to
redress,
and
both
subsections...
and
a
party
who
can
state
a
cause
of
action
under
either
subsection
is
entitled
to
invoke
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
under
subsection
(d).
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
found
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
that
when
congress
first
provided
the
bills
that...
the
initial
bills,
both
the
house
and
senate
bills,
they
provided
a
provision,
subsection
(a),
that
covered
any
person,
including
depository
institutions.
in
the
formulation
of
the
bill...
in
the
formulation
of
the
legislation,
congress
realized
that
the
interbank
question
required
special
expertise,
and
it
therefore
added
subsection
(f)
later,
and
also
added
language
to
(a)
that
excluded
depository
institutions
from
among
the
plaintiffs
that
might
invoke
that
cause
of
action,
so
the
placement
actually
reflects
the
genesis
of
the
legislation,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
it
actually
was
added
later
in
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
certainly
would
have.
it
would
have
been
better
organized,
but
that
still
doesn't
detract
from
the
substance
of
the
subsections
that
we're
discussing.
now,
the
united
states
also
disagrees
with
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
a
agency
tribunal
should
resolve
interbank
claims.
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
cases
such
as
coit
v.
fslic,
when
congress
decides
to
allow
agencies
to
adjudicate
private
disputes,
it
says
so
explicitly,
and
there
is
no
such
explicit
statement
in
this
statute
at
all.
the
efa
act
nowhere
states
that
the
board
has
the
power
or
authority
to
adjudicate
claims.
the
board's
regulations
reflect
that
limitation.
the
board
has
discerned
within
section
4010(f)
a
delegation
of
authority
to
establish
liability
rules,
but
it
has
not
discerned
any
delegation
of
authority
to
establish
standards
or
to
establish...
or
to
create
a
agency
tribunal
for
adjudicating
interbank
disputes.
instead,
the
board's
regulations
recognize
that
the
customary
mechanism
should
be
employed
in
this
situation,
and
the
customary
mechanism
is
a
judicial
action
in
federal
or
state
court.
the
united
states
also
disagrees
with
respondent's
suggestion
that
congress
intended
that
state
courts
would
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
interbank
disputes.
respondent
acknowledges
that
federal
courts
and
state
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
depositor
claims,
and
there's
no
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
with
regard
to
interbank
claims.
congress
authorized
the
board
to
regulate
the
payment
system
in
order
to
improve
the
interbank
check
collection
process,
and
it
would
be
quite
anomalous
to
provide
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
depositor
claims
but
not
interbank
claims.
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
providing
a
federal
forum
for
depositor
claims
no
matter
how
small,
while
denying
a
federal
forum
for
interbank
claims,
no
matter
how
large,
and
no
matter
what
impact
they
might
have
on
the
interbank
payment
system.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
agree
with
mr.
long
that
ultimately
it
leads
to
the
same
place.
we
believe
that
the
jurisdiction
question
should
be
resolved
within
the
four
corners
of
the
efa
act,
because
congress
has
specifically
addressed
the
question
here,
but
1331
jurisdiction
would
be
consistent
as
well,
and
in
fact
section
1331
indicates
the
general
tendency,
at
least
since
the
civil
war,
for
congress
to
provide
a
federal
forum
to
vindicate
or
address
federal
rights.
in
sum,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
concluding
that
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
court
should
reverse
the
decision
below
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
