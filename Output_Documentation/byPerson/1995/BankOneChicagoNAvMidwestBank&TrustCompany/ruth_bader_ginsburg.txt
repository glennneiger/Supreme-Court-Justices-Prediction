justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
long,
is
it
appropriate
for
us
to
give
any
weight
to
the
fed's
own
view
that
it
does
not
have
this
adjudicatory
authority?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
isn't
it
odd,
the
placement
of
this
statute?
you
would
expect
the
substantive
provisions
to
be
together,
(a)
and
(f),
and
then
(d)
to
follow
both
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
might
have
been
better
drafting,
then,
if
they
switched
to
put
the
jurisdictional
provision
at
the
end.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
epsteen,
is
this
your
second
view
of
the
case?
as
i
understand
it,
this
argument
was
raised
by
the
seventh
circuit
panel
on
its
own
motion,
and
you
had
not
questioned
federal
court
jurisdiction
up
until
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
kind
of
fleshing
out
the
rather
terse
seventh
circuit
explanation
of
what
it
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
epsteen,
is
that
indeed
your
position,
or
are
you
recognizing
that
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
but
it's
in
the
agency
in
the
first
instance,
or
are
you
saying
that
the
only
forum
for
these
interbank
disputes
is
the
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
the
agency
chose
to
exercise
that
authority,
where
would
the
next
stop
be?
where
would
the
review
be
of
the
agency's
initial
adjudication?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
would
it
be
the
d.c.
circuit,
would
it
be
any
district
court
where
the
bank...
the
same
venue
as
the
bank,
or
what...
where
would
it
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
how
could
the
agency,
if
it
chose
to
adjudicate...
i
mean,
if
you're
right
in
what
you
answered
before,
that
the
agency
if
it
wanted
to
could
adjudicate,
then
you'd
have
apa
review
in
the
appropriate
district
court,
it
would
all
be
federal,
only
you
get
at
the
ground
floor
an
agency
instead
of
a
court,
then
it
would
all
be
federal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
that's
your
answer,
then
you
would
have
to
go
back
and
revise
what
you
said
about
the
agency,
if
it
wants
to
get
into
this
act,
could
set
itself
up
as
an
adjudicator,
and
then
you'd
have
district
court
review,
so
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
if
it's
state,
well
then
the
agency
can't
get
into
it
even
if
it
wanted
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
again,
are
you
saying
that
congress
has
not
provided
for
the
agency
either?
i
think
you're
now
shifting
your
position,
because
initially
you
said
it
could
be
the
state
court,
or
if
the
agency
wanted
to,
could
be
the
agency.
now
you
seem
to
be
saying
there
can
be
no
federal
adjudicator,
the
only
adjudicator
is
the
state
unless
congress
amends
the
statute.
which
one
is
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
means
that
the
agency
could
not
adjudicate
even
if
it
wanted
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
different
position
than
the
one
you
were
taking
up
till
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
what
do
you
make
of
the
seventh
circuit,
that
says
disputes
such
as
this
are
to
be
handled
administratively
before
the
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
went
on
to
say
the
board
has
informed
us
it
doesn't
have
any
mechanism
to
do
this,
but
that's
the
board's
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
a
different
spin
on
it
than
the
seventh
circuit,
because
as
i
read
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion,
the
seventh
circuit
was
pretty
sure
about
the
federal
reserve
system
but
not
so
sure
about
state
courts,
because
it
said,
or
perhaps
in
state
court,
so
the
seventh
circuit
seemed
to
think
of
this
as
an
agency
adjudication,
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
so
that
theory,
whatever
it
was,
is
quite
different
from
yours,
because
theirs
did
not
turn
on
the
state
courts
as
being
the
adjudicator.
they
had
a
question
mark
about
state
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you're
not
disputing
that
the
state
courts
are
an
appropriate
forum.
