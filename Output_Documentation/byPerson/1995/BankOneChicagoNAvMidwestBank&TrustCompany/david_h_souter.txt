i'm
not
sure
that
that
proves
your
point,
because
it
speaks...
as
you
were
quoting
it,
it
speaks
of
allocating
risks,
not
of
imposing
liability,
which
sounds
to
me
as
though
what
it's
talking
about
under
(f)
is
the
promulgation
of
rules
which
determine
who
will
bear
the
liability,
i.e.
the
risk
of
loss,
and
not
a
rule
which
actually
imposes
liability
in
a...
or
an
act
of
the
agency
which
imposes
liability
in
a
specific
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
you
were
not
quoting
that
language
to
show
that,
or
to
prove
your
claim
that
(f)
is
an
adjudicatory
authorization.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
a
separate
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
that
merely
a
matter
of
fact,
or
because
of
the
word
laws
in
1331?
you're
saying
a
regulation
is
not
a
law
under
1331.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
a
regulation
a
law
under
1331?
