mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
out
to
clarify
one
point
here,
and
that
is
that
regulation
cc
is
not
promulgated
pursuant
to
611(f).
611(f),
when
it
talks
about
rule-making
in
that
title,
is
not
talking
about
the
kind
of
regulations
that
are
involved
in
regulation
cc,
which
is
the
regulation
that
the
suit
sought
to
enforce,
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
portion
of
the
legislative
debate
which
is
quoted
at
pages
17
and
18
of
our
brief.
and
if
i
may
just
read
one
paragraph
of
the
joint
conference
report,
which
points
out
that
it
is
section
609
where
these
regulations
would
be
promulgated
under,
not
under
611(f),
and
it...
in
the
report,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
18
of
my
brief,
the
report
says,
for
example,
under
this
subsection...
and
they're
referring
to
611(f)...
the
federal
reserve
may
allocate
or
impose
liability
on
depository
institutions
for
risks
of
losses
incurred
by
other
depository
institutions,
their
accountholders
or
other
owners
or
holders
of
a
check
due
to
a
depository
institution's
failure
to
handle
the
check
in
accordance
with
regulations
imposed
under
section
609.
that
is
12
u.s.c.
4008,
so--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--justice
souter,
my
point
being
is
in
this
case
the
claim
was
that
midwest
bank
failed
to
exercise
ordinary
care
as
required
by
12
c.f.r.
229.38,
that
that
rule,
which
is
part
of
regulation
cc,
is
not
promulgated
under
611(f).
that's
promulgated
under
4008.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
no.
i
was--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--i
was...
right.
i
was
quoting
this
language
to
point
out
that
if
there
is
rule-making
authority,
and
611(f),
the
language
of
611(f)
doesn't
talk
specifically
about
rule-making
authority
but
the
heading
or
the
title
to
it
does,
and
if
you
view
611(f)
to
be
ambiguous
so
that
you
resort
to
the
caption
or
the
title
of
that
subsection,
then
you
would
also
look
to
extrinsicate
such
as
the
legislative
history--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
yes,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
language
and
the
structure
of
611,
subpart
6511(a),
subsection
611(a)
and
611(f)
are
very
different,
that
under
section
611(a),
which
the
petitioner
and
the
united
states
say
are
parallel
provisions,
the
language
is
quite
different.
under
(a)
they
say,
is
liable
to
anyone
other
than
another
depository
institution.
in
our
briefs
we
use
the
term
banks
to
refer
to
depository
institutions
generally,
but--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--no.
no,
i
don't.
your
honor--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--what
i'm
suggesting
is,
it
doesn't
say
rule-making
in
(f)
anywhere,
either,
and
i'm
saying
that
since
the
court
raised
the
rule-making
question,
and
seem
to
believe
that
rule-making
was
authorized
by
(f)
and
that
regulation
cc,
the
regulation--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--i
think
the
rule-making
is
under
section
609,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
i
don't
believe
it
is
specific
as
to
which
section
it
is
relying
on
in
the
act.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well,
i
agreed
with
your
honor
until
you
got
to
the
last
part,
with
all
due
respect.
i
believe
it
is
the
prescribing,
or
the
passage
of
the
promulgation
of
the
regulations
comes
under
609.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
because,
as
that
they
point
out,
i
believe,
in
the
legislative
history,
that
congress
intended
all
of
the
regulation,
of
these
regulations
to
be
promulgated
under
609,
that
i
think
the
rules
that
they're
talking
about
are
perhaps
rules
for
procedures
for
imposing
liability.
i
think
611(f)
gives
the
board
authority
to
impose
liability.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
that's
true.
we
had...
i'm
embarrassed
to
say
that
we
had
not
raised
the
argument
on
our
own
when
we
should
have.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well,
when
the
seventh
circuit
raised
the
issue
and
we
looked
at
it,
we
became
convinced
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
correct
that
there
was
no
federal
question
jurisdiction.
one
of
the
things
is
that
there
have
been
federal
regulations
for
some
years
governing
interbank
check
disputes.
regulation
j,
which
is
12(c)
of
our
part
210...
it's
the
one
we
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
it's
been
around
since
october
of
1980.
when
we
started
looking
at
it,
we
were
unable
to
find
a
single
case
under
regulation
j
or
regulation
cc
where
the
federal
courts
had
found
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
1331
to
enforce
a
claim
for
violation
of
regulation
j
or
regulation
cc,
that
regulation...
but
we
were
able
to
find
cases
where
under
state
law,
and
we've
cited
a
couple
as
examples
in
our
brief,
where,
under
the
uniform
commercial
code,
which
incorporates
the
federal
regulations
as
part
of
state
law...
under
4-103
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
these
become
part
of
the
state
law
in
all
of
the
states,
and
they
have
been
applied
throughout
the
states,
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
within
this
act
with
respect
to
interbank
disputes
which
changes
that.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
as
far
as
i
know,
every
state,
your
honor,
has
the
provision
which
would,
with
respect
to
banks
incorporates
these
regulations.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well,
but
that
has
been
around
for
sometime,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
regulations
that
are
promulgated
by
the
federal
reserve
board
and
their
official
commentary
throughout
them
recognizes
the
interplay
between
the
regulations
and
the
uniform
commercial
code.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well,
i
think
there
would
be
jurisdiction
within
the
agency
if
the
agency
sought
to
exercise
it,
but
since
the
agency
has
declined
to
exercise
it,
our
point
is
that
there
certainly
is
still
a
forum
in
which
these
claims
could
be
adjudicated
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well,
i
think
the
agency's
adjudication
would
then,
if
it
decided...
and
i
think
under
(f)
it
can
pass
and
promulgate
some
rules
for
its
process
of
adjudication,
and
i
think
it
would
then
be
subject
to
judicial
review
under
the
administrative
procedures
act.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
i
don't
have
a
specific...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
i
think
it
would
be...
i
must
apologize.
i
have
not
focused
on
the
apa
act's
procedures.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
i
believe
it
would
be
in
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
this
is
the
only
federal
court
that
i
know
of
that
has
jurisdiction
to
review
decisions
of
state
courts.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well,
i
think
that
this
court
always
has
the
jurisdiction
to
review
the
decision
of
the
state
court.
it's
the
highest
court
of
any
state,
and
in
that
sense
i
say
that
it
has,
but
it
is
incorporated
into
state
law,
and
it's
really
a
state
law
question,
and
if
congress
wanted
to
make
this
a
federal
law
question
it
certainly
could
have.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
i
think
it
is
a
state
law
question
under
the
federal
regulations.
i
think--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--that
is
correct,
but
i
understood
justice
stevens'
question
to
be
that
if
it
were
brought
in
the
state
court,
where
the
federal
regulations
become
a
part
of
the
state
law,
they
become
agreements
under
the
state
law
under
4-103
of
the
code,
of
the
uniform
commercial
code,
then
it's
really
proceeding
under
state
law,
although
i
guess
construction
of
any
regulations
promulgated
by
the
board,
if
we're
talking
about
how
the
interpretation
or
construction,
it
would
be
federal--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--would
be
federal--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--yes.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--well,
first
of
all,
1331
has
not...
as
far
as
i
know
never
conferred
jurisdiction
in
any
federal
regulation
case
involving
the
check
collection
process,
and
these
federal
regulations
have
been
around
for
some
years,
and--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--no,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
first
of
all--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--i
view
a
regulation
promulgated
pursuant
to
a
statute
to
be
a
law.
i
don't
view
it
to
have...
i
don't
elevate
it
to
a
statute,
but
i
accept
that
it
is
a
law,
but--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--but--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
when
congress
in
611,
and
i
agree
with
the
united
states'
position
on
this
that
we
ought
to
really
confine
ourselves
to
the
four
corners
of
this
act,
when
congress
specifically
says
under
(a)
there
is
no
juris--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--it
doesn't
say
there's
no...
it
says
there's
no
cause
of
action
under
(a).
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
under
(a),
no
cause
of
action
for
interbank
disputes.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
and
under
(d)--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--correct.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
i
misspoke
if
i
said
something
differently.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
(a)
is
specific
in
excluding
an
action
brought
by
a
bank
against
another
bank.
it
says
there's
no
cause
of
action
that
congress
is
authorizing
here,
and
we
don't
believe
that
(f)
authorizes
a
cause
of
action.
if
(f)
does
authorize
a
cause
of
action,
you
don't
need
to
go
to
1331.
then
you
are
to
611(d).
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--that's
true,
but
if
you
are
looking
at
titles,
it
is
(a),
then--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--as
to
civil
liability,
and
(f),
which
has
a
very
different--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--a
very
different
title--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--and
so
if
you...
if
the
court
were
to
view
(f)
as
creating
a
cause
of
action,
i
would
suggest
that
when
congress
picked
the
language
for
(a),
it
knew
that
this
language
in
(a)
would
create
a
cause
of
action.
it
took
it
from
the
federal
truth
in
lending
act,
which
the
courts
have
held
creates
a
cause
of
action.
(f)'s
language,
if
you
put
the
two
side-by-side,
is
very
different
from--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--i
say
there
is
no
federal
cause
of
action
created--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--well,
if
that
were
a
problem
and
the
federal
reserve
board
perceived
a
problem
in
uniformity,
and
congress
perceived
such
a
problem,
it
certainly
could
change
the
legislation.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well,
i
think
that
the
issue
of
whether
the
agency
could
or
couldn't
do
it
really
arises
out
of
the
dicta
in
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion,
because
the
agency
has
not
attempted
to
do
it.
it
has
been
our
position
since
this
issue
has
been
raised
that
these
claims
are
properly
asserted
in
the
state
courts
under
the
uniform
commercial
code,
and
if
congress
wants
them
to
be
in
the
federal
courts,
it
has
to
amend
the
statute.
we
don't
believe
that
this
statute
creates
a
cause
of
action
under
(f).
it
permits
a
bank...
and
let
me
suggest
that
under--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--if...
i
believe
that
these
actions
are
to
be
adjudicated
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
in
the
state
courts
between
banks.
i
believe
congress
has
not
created
a
federal
cause
of
action.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
i
think
that...
yes.
if
that
is--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--yes.
yes.
yes...
it
is...
if
it
is
not
a
cause
of
action
that
is
a...
certainly
in
our
view
it
is
not
a
cause
of
action
that
is
a
judicially
enforceable
cause
of
action,
the
way
i
understand
the
term
cause
of
action,
and--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--well--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--well,
i
think...
i
think
there
are
times
when
clearinghouses...
and
in
my
experience,
i
have
seen
situations
where
clearinghouses
administratively
deal
with
claims
of
banks
without
a
hearing
based
on
written
submissions,
but
i
believe
that
this
is
not
a
federal
cause
of
action
that
is
enforceable
in
federal
courts,
as
cause
of
action
is
talked
about,
let's
say
in
davis
v.
passman,
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
i
don't
think
that
congress
has
given
banks
the
right
to
bring
an
action
under
this
act
specifically,
under
611(f),
and
if--
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
--that's...
they
did,
and
the
initial
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
didn't
refer
to
the
state
courts,
and
there
was
some
concern
that
they
might
have
been
blocking
out
the
state
courts,
and
then
on
rehearing
they
revised
their
opinion
and
put
their
phrase
in,
oh,
perhaps
in
state
courts.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
they
had
a
question
mark
about
state
court,
they...
but
they
believed
that
the
board
could
administratively
decide
interbank
disputes,
that's
true,
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
create
a
type
of
cause
of
action
that
would
be
a
judicially
enforceable
cause
of
action
that
would
trigger
611(d).
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
there
is...
in
the
district
court,
the
standard
bank
case.
that's
the
only
case
that
i'm
familiar
with,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
well,
one
of
the
things
we
did
in
preparing
for
this
case,
your
honor,
was
went
to
the
computer
research
and
punched
in
the
regulations,
and
to
see
the
cases,
and
i
was
unable
to
find
a
single
federal
case
where
there
was
federal
question
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
regulation
j
or
regulation
cc.
i
found
federal
cases,
but
they
were
diversity
cases
that
did
not
find
their
jurisdiction
on
a
federal
question
but
on
grounds
of
diversity,
and
i
found
state
cases.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
not
a
large
number,
but
i'd
say
maybe
a
dozen
cases.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
yes,
since
1980,
although
regulation
j
was
amended
a
few
times
and
got
certainly
more
substance
in
'85
and
'86,
and
one
of
the
interesting
parts
of
regulation
j
in
'86
is
that
the
federal
reserve
board,
while
these
were
all
being
enforced
through
state
courts,
said
there's
one
area
of
nonuniformity
which
is
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
in
1986
they
put
a
2-year
statute
of
limitations
in
regulation
j
so
that
when
it
was
enforced
through
the
uniform
commercial
code
in
all
the
state
courts,
there
would
be
a
uniform
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
robert
g.
epsteen
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
i'm
sorry.
i
just
don't
know
the
answer.
i
think
the
court
really
understands
our
view
on
deference
from
prior
questions,
and
i
would
just
like
to
make
a
brief
comment
that
the
crop
of
fragmented...
fragmented
or
multiple
adjudication
concerns
here
really
don't
exist,
since
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute
under
28
1367(a)
has
been
enacted.
i
believe
that
there
is
not
a
problem
there.
if
an
individual
or
a
person
other
than
a
bank
brings
a
suit
in
the
federal
court,
and
then
there
is
a
dispute
between
two
banks,
it
could
be
brought
in
under
1367(a)
of
