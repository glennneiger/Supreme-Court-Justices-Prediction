justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
long,
would
it
make
any
substantive
difference
whether
federal
courts
had
jurisdiction
under
section
4010
immediately,
or
whether
they
had
it
only
indirectly
under
section
1331
of
title
28?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
we
have
an
administrative
procedure
act
which
does
all
of
that.
i
mean,
most
agencies
that
conduct
both
adjudication
and
rule-making
don't
have
special
provisions.
that's
not
a
real
obstacle,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
question
of
whether...
whether
we
should
interpret
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
the
board
the
authority,
but
if
it...
if
the
board
has
the
authority,
there's
really
no
problem
about
what
procedures
it
would
have
to
use,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
all
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
contains.
it
also
contains
rather
specific
provisions
concerning
the
procedures
the
agency
has
to
use,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
you
think
there's
a
difference
when
the
board
is
just
speaking
about
its
own
house,
and
when
the
board
is
not...
i
mean,
when
the
board
says,
we
don't
have
it,
the
board
is
also
saying,
you
have
it,
that
is,
the
federal
courts.
i
mean,
that's
as
much
our
bailiwick
as
it
is
the
board's.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
different
from
the
usual
deference
situation
when
the
board
is
just
talking
about
its
own
ox.
here,
it's
talking
about
its
own
ox
and
also
our
ox,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
courts
ought
to
be
able
to
look
after
their
own
ox.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
long--
justice
antonin
scalia
--subsection
(e)
of
4010
says
that
no
provision
of
this
section
imposing
any
liability
shall
apply
to
any
act
done
or
omitted
in
good
faith
in
conformity
with
any
rule,
regulation,
or
interpretation
thereof
by
the
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
now,
in
what
context
would
the
board
have
occasion
to
interpret
some
of
its
rules
and
regulations
pertaining
to
these
matters
unless
it
is
in
the
context
of
adjudicating
whether
those
rules
or
regulations
have
been
violated?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
issue
interpretive
bulletins?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
be
binding
on
the
courts...
well,
at
least
as
far
as
assessing
liability
when
anybody's
acting
in
good
faith
reliance
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
do
you
agree
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
under
4010
or
under
section
1331
of
title
28?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say,
i
don't
understand
what
language
in
(f)
you
are
hanging
this
legislative
history
on.
what
ambiguity
in
(f)
is
it
clarifying?
it
seems
to
me
(f)
is
clear
and
straightforward.
the
board
is
authorized
to
impose
liability
in
connection
with
any
aspect
of...
do
you
read
it
risks
of
loss
and
liability
mean
risk
of
loss
and
risk
of
liability?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
not
just
look
up
above
to
(e),
reliance
on
board
rulings,
which
says
no
provision
of
this
section
imposing
any
liability
shall
apply
to
any
act
done
or
made
in
good
faith
in
conforming
with
any
rule,
regulation,
or
interpretation
thereof?
i
mean,
doesn't
that
make
it
very
clear
that
they
have
rule-making
under
this
section?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we're
sort
of
at
the
mercy
of
the
states.
i
mean,
if
a
state
wants
to
repeal
the
ucc
entirely...
does
louisiana
have
the
whole
ucc?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
that's
a
lucky
thing,
because
otherwise
on
your
theory
there
wouldn't
be
any
relief
in
any
court
in
that
state,
neither
federal
nor
state
courts.
its
only
by
grace
of
the
states
having
adopted
that
ucc
provision
that
this
liability
is
enforceable
anywhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
district
court.
the
fallback...
the
fallback
jurisdiction
is
in
the
district
court
under
the
apa.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
has
to
be
a
federal
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
since
it
is
a
federal
question,
why
doesn't
section
1331
get
you
to
the
same
destination
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
claim
section
1331
is
not
at
issue
here,
but
just
indulge
me
that
i
think
it
is,
and
even
if
it
isn't,
if
i
think
that
1331's
going
to
lead
you
to
the
same
destination
anyway,
i'm
not
going
to...
you
know,
i'm
not
going
to
bend
over
backwards
to
hold
that,
you
know,
(f)
doesn't
apply,
because
what's
the
difference,
you
may
as
well...
if
it's
at
all
ambiguous
you
may
as
well
hold
that
(f)
gets
you
there
and
have
it
all
in
the
same
statute.
why
do
you
say
1331
doesn't
govern?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
explanation
for
the
phenomenon
you
describe
is
simply
that
there
is
a
specific
jurisdictional
provision
that
covers
all
these
other
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
there
isn't
one,
then
you
go
to
the
fallback
jurisdiction
of
1331,
and
why
wouldn't
that
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
there's
no
jurisdiction
on
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
(a),
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says,
liability
under
this
subsection.
what
does
that
refer
to
in
(f),
if
it
doesn't
refer
to
liability
created
by
the
subsection?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says,
liability
under
this
subsection
shall
not
exceed
the
amount
of
the
check
giving
rise
to
the
loss
or
liability,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
liability
under
this
subsection.
i
don't...
can't
imagine
clearer--
--moreover,
the--
--indication
that
the
subsection
is
creating
liability.
moreover,
the
title
to
4010
is
civil
liability.
that
covers
all
the
subsections,
i
would
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
there's
no
federal
cause
of
action.
you're
saying
there's
no
federal
cause
of
action,
so
then
you
should
change
your
answer
as
to
whether
we
could
review
a
state
decision.
there's
no
federal
cause
of
action
being
created
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
the
states
can
decide
it,
and
they
can
all
come
out
different
ways
about
what
the
federal
regulation
means,
because
this
is
not
a
federal
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
epsteen,
i
ought
to
know
this,
but
i
don't,
does
the
board
do
any
other
adjudication?
do
they
have
administrative
law
judges
down
there
that...
is
it
purely
a
rule-making
body?
does
it
adjudicate
any
other
disputes?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
need
them
at
least
for
personnel
matters
on
occasion,
and
would
have
to
borrow
them
for
that,
i
would
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wonder
what
their
secret
is.
do
you
think
you
could--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
explanation
for
the
lack
of
lawsuits
in
federal
court
under
other
board
regulations?
how--
