chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
94-1175,
bank
one
chicago
v.
midwest
bank
&
trust
company.
mr.
long.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
wouldn't
just
be
a
serious
question
if
the
board
purported
to
say
that
there
was
federal
jurisdiction,
there
would
be
no
deference
at
all,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
long.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
epsteen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
do
get
into
the
legislative
history,
i
suppose
you
do
rely
on
the
words,
impose
liability,
in
the
second
paragraph--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
the
thing
you
quote,
which
is
different
from
allocating
risks,
i
suppose
you
say.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
epsteen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
long,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
fact
that
they
get
their
administrative
law
judges
out
of
a
pool
cut
one
way
or
another
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
their
secret
is
that
a
bad
settlement
is
better
than
a
good
lawsuit.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
federal
reserve
bank
jurisdictional
provision,
it
doesn't
just
mean
if
you're
insured.
it
actually
has
to
be
a
federal
reserve
bank
before
jurisdiction
is
deemed--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
long.
the
case
is
submitted.
