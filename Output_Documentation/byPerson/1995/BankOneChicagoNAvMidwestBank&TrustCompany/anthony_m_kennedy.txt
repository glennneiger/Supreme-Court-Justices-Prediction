justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it,
in
line
with
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
the
board
has
promulgated
regulations
that
require
that
the
checks
be
honored
with
diligence
and
in
good
faith.
those,
i
take
it,
are
federal
standards
to
be
interpreted
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
board
had
determined
that
it
should
be
the
one
to
determine
what
is
good
faith,
and
that
it
should
adjudicate
these
claims,
could
it
have
set
up
an
adjudicative
mechanism
under
the
existing
statute,
or
do
you
think
additional
authority
would
be
required
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there's
no
statutory
mechanism
for
review,
for
judicial
review
of
any
such
administrative--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
board
purport
to
be
applying
either
611
or
609
when
it
issued
regulation
cc?
did
it
cite
either
section
and
say
that
it
was
proceeding
under
one
or
the
other?
