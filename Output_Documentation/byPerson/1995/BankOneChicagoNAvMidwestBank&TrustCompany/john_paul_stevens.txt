justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
if
a
proceeding
were
brought
in
the
state
court
under
your
view,
trying
to
enforce
the
regulation,
would
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
a
decision
of
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
there
would
be
a
federal
question,
in
your
view.
they
would
be
subject
to
review
on
direct...
subject
to
our
review
under
direct
appeal,
and
so
forth,
and
certiorari.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it's
a
state
law
question,
then
we
would
not
have
jurisdiction.
i'm
really...
that's
what
i'm
probing
for.
do
you
think
in
final
analysis
it
is
a
state
law
question
or
a
federal
law
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
isn't
quite
right.
it
just
says
(a)
itself
doesn't
create
a
cause
of
action
for
interbanks
disputes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
(a)
also
says--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
epstein?
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression,
as
i
understand
it,
and
since
we
granted
cert,
has
it
arisen
in
any
other
court,
do
you
know,
other
than
the
seventh
circuit?
i
know
there
was
one
there
that
was
dismissed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
kind
of
interesting,
because
there
must
be
zillions
of
these
transactions,
and
so
scarce
litigation.
i
guess
the
banks
normally
work
these
things
out
informally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
just
a
few,
isn't
that
correct,
or
were
there
a
lot
of
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
that's
since...
regulation
j
has
been
on
the
books
about
15
years,
hasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
if
you
don't
expect
there
to
be
very
many.
not
if
it's
a
fairly
rare--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--piece
of
litigation.
it
doesn't
happen...
they
don't...
banks
don't
fight
with
each
other
all
that
often,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
still,
10
or
12
cases
in
15
years
out
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
millions
of
transactions
indicates
it's
a
fairly
rare
situation
when
you
get
into
court
over
something
like
this.
