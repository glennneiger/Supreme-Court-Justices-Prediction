i
mean,
just...
i'm
not
certain
what
the
relevance
of
this
argument
is
to
the
case
question
in
front
of
us,
but
if
it
is
relevant,
looking
at
609,
and
i
just
looked
at
it
briefly,
it
sounds
as
if
609
says
you
can
promulgate
regulations
to
tell
banks
what
to
do,
and
it
sounds
as
if
611(f)
is
saying
you
can
do
another
thing,
too.
the
other
thing
is
to
impose
liability
of
certain
kinds
upon
them
to
certain
people
when
they
don't
do
what
you
told
them
to
do
under
609,
and
if
that's
so,
on
its
face,
regulation
cc
seems
to
be
a
regulation
that
talks
about
imposing
liability
for
failing
to
do
something
that
some
other
regulation
probably
told
them
to
do,
so
on
its
face,
regulation
cc
looks
as
if
it
comes
after...
under
611,
and
not
under
609.
now,
i
mean,
that's
just
a
very
quick
look
at
it,
and
because
i
hadn't
looked
at
that
before,
but
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
liability
part...
for
example,
it
says,
a
bank
that
fails
to
act
in
good
faith
under
this
subpart
may
be
liable
for
other
damages.
then
it
talks
about
standard
of
care,
and
it
talks
about
liability,
so
why
isn't
the
liability
part
of
cc
being
promulgated
under
611?
