mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
interbank
claims
for
damages
under
the
expedited
funds
availability
act
and
its
implementing
regulations.
in
the
civil
liability
section
of
the
act,
which
is
codified
at
12
united
states
code,
section
4010,
congress
provided
in
subsection
(d)
that
any
action
under
this
section
may
be
brought
in
federal
court
or
state
court.
in
subsection
(f)
of
section
4010,
congress
provided
for
liability
under
this
subsection
for
damages
for
violation
of
rules
governing
the
interbank
check
payment
system
promulgated
by
the
federal
reserve
board.
the
natural
reading
of
this
statutory
language
is
that
banks
have
an
action
under
subsection
(f)
for
violations
of
the
check-processing
rules,
and
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
such
actions
under
subsection
(d).
congress
placed
subsection
(f)
in
the
civil
liability
section
of
the
statute,
section
4010
provides
that
depositor
claims
under
subsection
(a)
maybe
brought
in
federal
court,
and
there
is
simply
no
indication
that
congress
intended
interbank
claims
to
be
adjudicated
in
a
different
forum.
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--we
think
that's
not
a
possible
interpretation
here.
first
of
all,
it's
not
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
says,
liability
under
this
subsection,
that
is,
liability
under
federal
law
rather
than
liability
under
state
law.
also,
it
would
be
highly
unusual
for
congress
to
provide
for
liability
for
damages
under
a
federal
statute
for
a
violation
of
federal
standards
and
rules,
and
yet
not
provide
for
a
federal
cause
of
action.
it
would
be
particularly
unusual
in
this
context,
where
congress
clearly
provided
that
depositors
have
a
cause
of
action
in
federal
court
sometimes
for
very
small
claims,
for
claims
of
as
little
as
100,
and
the
much
larger
interbank
claims
we
think
ought
to
be
treated
the
same.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think
the
short
answer
is
no.
those
are
two
routes
to
the
same
conclusion
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
they're
federal
standards,
and
they
really
are
a
substantial
change
in
this
area.
when
congress
passed
this
act,
it
federalized
to
a
substantial
extent
an
area
that
had
been
an
area
of
state
law,
and
the
federal
standards
that
the
federal
reserve
board
has
adopted
under
regulation
cc
do
impose
significant
new
obligations
on
banks,
including
a
duty
of
expeditious
return
of
checks.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think
additional
authority
would
be
required.
under
this
court's
decision
in
coit
v.
fslic
courts
are
not
quick
to
imply
agency
authority
to
adjudicate
private
claims
for
damages,
particularly
in
a
context,
and
we're
in
that
context
here--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that's
right.
congress
said
nothing
about
what
procedure
should
be
followed,
said
nothing
about
judicial
review,
and
in
other
areas
where
the
federal
reserve
does
have
enforcement
authority
and
adjudicatory
authority,
congress
was
quite
careful...
this
is
in
12
u.s.c.
section
1818...
to
spell
out
the
procedural
requirements
and
to
provide
for
judicial
review.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
agree
that
presumptively
under
the
apa
there
would
be
judicial
review,
but
under
a
decision
such
as
coit,
where
congress
has
demonstrated
that
when
it
wants
an
agency
to
adjudicate--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
there
would
be
a
problem
about
what
procedures
the
agency
would
use.
there
would
be
presumptively
judicial
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
courts
are
supposed
to
be
careful
about
telling
the
agency
what--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
i
agree
with
that,
but
again,
the
coit
decision
says
that
in
the
context
where
congress
has
been
quite
specific
and
precise
and
explicit
about
giving
adjudicatory
authority
to
an
agency
to
adjudicate
private
claims,
the
court
will
not
infer
that
authority
where
it's
not
been
expressly
given.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
is,
justice
ginsburg.
the
board's
view
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
to
decide
these
claims
is
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
agree
the
two
questions
are
closely
related.
if
it
were
a
question
of
whether
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction,
i
think
there
would
be
a
serious
question
about
whether
to
defer,
but
here
congress
provided,
i
think
in
very
clear
language,
that
any
action
under
this
section
may
be
brought
in
federal
court.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
would
concede
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
here
it's
not
a
question
of
jurisdiction,
because
we
have
subsection
(d).
at
most,
it's
a
question
of
whether
there's
an
action
under
subsection
(f),
and
congress
did
give
a
very
broad
grant
of
authority
to
the
agency
to
promulgate
interbank
liability
rules
under
that
subsection.
i
think
certainly
at
a
minimum
the
board's
view
that
it
does
not
have
the
authority
to
adjudicate
claims
for
violations
of
those
rules
is
entitled
to
deference.
i
would
go
a
step
further
and
say
that
the
board's
view
that
there
is
an
action
under
subsection
(f)
is
also
a
matter
that
the
court
could
properly
defer
to
the
agency.
the
text
of
section
4010
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
congress
was
primarily
concerned
with
expediting
customer
access
to
deposited
funds,
and
to
achieve
that
goal,
it
legislated
funds
availability
schedules,
and
it
required
banks
to
disclose
their
funds
availability
policies
to
customers
and
also
required
banks
to
begin
paying
interest
promptly,
but
congress
was
also
concerned
with
speeding
up
the
interbank
check
payment
system.
congress
recognized
that
the
slowness
of
the
system
was
a
principal
reason
for
the
lengthy
holds
on
checks,
and
it
also
recognized
that
if
it
required
banks
to
make
deposited
funds
available
more
quickly
but
did
nothing
about
the
slowness
of
the
interbank
payment
system,
banks
would
be
exposed
to
a
risk
of
loss
of
the
checks
ultimately
were
not
paid.
now,
congress
addressed
this
more
technical
issue
about
how
to
improve
the
check
payment
system
not
by
legislating
a
particular
solution,
but
by
giving
the
federal
reserve
board
broad
authority
to
regulate
the
system.
it
directed
the
board
to
consider
a
variety
of
possible
improvements
to
the
system
which
are
set
out
in
12
u.s.c.
section
4008,
it
gave
the
federal
reserve
a
broad
grant
of
authority
to
regulate
any
aspect
of
the
payment
system,
also
in
section
4008,
and
in
4010(f)
it
gave
the
board
an
additional
grant
of
authority
to
establish
liability
rules
for
damages.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
the
federal
reserve
would
have
authority
to
interpret
its
rules,
and,
indeed,
it's
issued
an
extensive
commentary
to
the
rules
that
accompanies
them
without
conducting
any
adjudications.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
to
that
extent,
yes,
i
think
so.
but
to
return
to
purpose
for
a
moment,
in
giving
this
additional
grant
in
subsection
(f)
of
authority
not
only
to
regulate
any
aspect
of
the
system
but
to
impose
liability
for
damages,
to
establish
liability
rules,
there's
no
indication
that
congress
intended
civil
liability
claims
for
violations
of
these
check
processing
rules
to
be
adjudicated
in
a
different
forum,
or
handled
differently
from
other
civil
liability
claims
under
the
statute.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
interbank
claims
should
be
adjudicated
by
the
federal
reserve
board.
there
are
at
least
five
reasons
why
that
interpretation
is
not
correct.
first,
it
doesn't
fit
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
congress
authorized
the
federal
reserve
board
to
impose
on
or
allocate
among
banks
risk
of
loss
and
liability,
not
to
impose
actual
liability
through
adjudication.
that
language
is
consistent
with
rule-making.
second,
it's
inconsistent
with
the
coit
principle
that
we've
discussed
that
authority
to
adjudicate
is
not
to
be
lightly
inferred.
third,
the
administrative
enforcement
mechanisms
available
to
the
federal
reserve
board
simply
don't
include
a
mechanism
for
imposing
liability
for
damages
on
a
private
party.
they
have
remedies
for
cease
and
desist
orders,
civil
penalties,
the
usual
gamut
of
enforcement
provisions,
but
not
authority
to
have
an
adjudicative
tribunal.
fourth
is
the
deference
that's
owed
to
the
board's
view
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction,
and
fifth
is
the
sort
of
fragmented
adjudications
that
would
result
under
the
court
of
appeals
view.
bank
claims
would
go
to
an
agency.
in
fact,
there
are
several
agencies
that
share
authority
for
enforcing
this,
so
there
could
be
intraagency
jurisdictional
problems.
if
a
bank
had
a
state
law
claim,
presumably
that
would
go
to
state
court.
if
there
were
depositor
claims
arising
out
of
the
same
set
of
facts,
that
could
go
to
federal
court
or
state
court,
and
it
seems
quite
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
sort
of
fragmentation.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
when
the
expedited
funds
act
was
passed,
the
federal
reserve
board
had
no
administrative
law
judges
at
all.
it
borrowed
them
on
the
rare
occasions
when
it
needed
them.
even
today,
there
is
only
a
pool
of
administrative
law
judges
that
is
shared
by
the
various
federal
agencies
that
supervise
banking
and
financial
institutions.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
emphasizes
how
unusual
it
would
be
to
assume
that
congress
intended
the
agency
to
start
adjudicating
all
these
interbank
claims.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--very
few
checks
are
returned,
but
it
still
adds
up
to
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
millions
a
year.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think
banks
seem
to
be
fairly
good
at
working
out
their
differences,
but
it
does
come
up,
and
they
need
a
place
to
go
to
work
them
out.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
good
rational--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
you
had
mentioned
4010(e)
in
the
interpretations
of
the
board.
i'm
told
that
other
statutes
such
as
the
truth
in
lending
act
have
similar
provisions,
but
it's...
the
agency
has
no
adjudicatory
authority
under
those
statutes.
on
the
interplay
between
609
and
611,
i
think
justice
breyer
i
agree
with
completely.
609
gives
the
board
authority
to
regulate
any
aspect
of
the
payment
system,
but
the
additional
authority
to
promulgate
rules
imposing
liability
for
damages
goes
beyond
just
prescribing
or
proscribing
behavior,
and
that's
where
you
need
the
4010(f).
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
regulation
j
has
been
around
for
quite
a
long
time.
there
has
been
significant
litigation
in
federal
court
under
regulation
j.--
generally,
regulation
j
regulates
the
relationship
of
federal
reserve
banks
to
other
banks
in
check
processing,
and
there's
a
statute,
12
u.s.c.
section
632,
that
provides
whenever
a
federal
reserve
bank
is
a
defendant
or
a
party
the
action
is
deemed
to
arise
under
federal
law,
so
there
are
those
cases,
and
when
the
federal
reserve
is
in
the
case,
as
it
frequently
is,
that
solves
all
the
jurisdictional
problems.
this
particular
provision
in
regulation
j
requiring
banks
to
notify
the
depository
bank
if
it's
a
big
check
and
they
were
returning
it
only
came
in
in
1985.
it
was
shortly
before
the
act,
which
was
1987,
so
there
really
wasn't
a
great
deal
of
time
for
courts
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
citation
is
12
u.s.
code
section
632.
i
believe
it's
just
a
federal
reserve
bank.
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
puerto
rico
i
believe
does
not
have
this
provision
of
the
ucc
that
incorporates
by
reference
the
federal
reserve
regulations.
puerto
rico
is
covered
by
the
expedited
funds
act.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
oh,
no,
and
4010(d)
gives
the
concurrent
jurisdiction.
it's
concurrent.
and
finally,
on
the
titles,
it
is
true
that
4010
says
civil
liability
and
4010(a)
says
civil
liability,
but
if
you
look
at
4009,
it
says
administrative
enforcement,
and
4009(a)
also
says
administrative
enforcement,
so
there
seems
to
be
a
pattern
here
of
repeating
in
the
first
subsection
the
title.
i
have
nothing
further.
