justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
bender,
we
have
two
separate
questions,
i
think,
one
whether
the
original
finding
of
the
lower
courts
that
there
was
an
equal
protection
violation
here
of
the
constitution
for
virginia
to
have
vmi
but
no
comparable
program
for
women,
whether
that
was
a
correct
determination
and,
secondly,
i
think
we
have
to
decide
whether
virginia's
proposed
remedy
of
the
development
of
the
mary
baldwin
college
program
is
constitutionally
adequate
as
a
remedy.
and
the
discussion
thus
far
doesn't
really
direct
us
to
either
of
those
questions,
and
i
notice
that
in
your
brief
the
solicitor
general
urges
the
court
to
adopt
the
highest
standard
of
strict
scrutiny
to
decide
this
case.
does
your
case
depend
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
it
be
decided,
as
the
lower
courts
did,
on
the
basis
of
intermediate
scrutiny--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
the
court
has
done
in
the
past?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
is
this
case
singled
out,
then,
for
urging
us
to
adopt
some
different
standard?
what
advantage
is
there--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
not
exactly
an
open
question
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
decided
a
number
of
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
applying
a
sort
of
intermediate
scrutiny.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
you
look
at
mississippi
university
for
women
v.
hogan,
the
court
certainly
tried
to
articulate
a
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bender--
--well,
mr.
bender,
if
vmi
were
to
establish
a
separate
program
for
women
students
within
vmi,
a
separate
dormitory,
and
provide
adversative
training
for
women
but
somehow
have
two
parallel
tracks,
but
the
degree
would
be
a
degree
from
vmi,
would
the
government
be
pressing
its
case
against
vmi?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
same,
the
same
thing,
just--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--like
the
men
have,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--they
have
their
own
separate
track
here.
i
mean,
their...
in
their--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--they
have
a
separate
dormitory,
and
they
have
their
own
adversative
training,
just
as
tough,
just
as
mean.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
just
the
same,
the
same
requirements,
and
they
get
a
degree
from
vmi.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
olson--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we
get
back
to
the
posture
of
this
case,
and
one
issue
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
virginia
can
provide
single
sex
education
to
just
one
sex,
to
just
men.
that's
one
of
these
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
want
to
defend
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
want
to
say
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to
provide
a
single
sex
education
just
for
men.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
one
of
the
cases
we
have
before
us.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
that
gets
us
into
the
second
question,
which
is
remedy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
olson,
how
many
states
today
fund
single
sex
education
programs
at
the
college
and/or
high
school
level?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
citadel,
in
south
carolina,
and
vmi?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they're
the
only
two
remaining?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
possible
for
a
state
to
provide
tuition
funds
to
students
on
a
per
capita
basis
for
higher
education
and
say,
now,
you
take
the
money
and
go
where
you
want
to
go?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
under
the
religion
clauses
i
don't
think
the
court
has
held,
has
it,
that
a
state
is
prohibited
from
providing
aid
on
a
per
capita
basis
of
some
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
how
would
the
court
decide
that?
we
would
only
decide
whether,
in
this
case,
on
these
facts,
at
the
time
this
case
came
up,
whether
virginia
had
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
