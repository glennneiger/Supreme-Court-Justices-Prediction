mr.
bender--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
a
predictive
thing,
isn't
it?
it's
never
been
tried,
so
these
are
opinions
of
what
might
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bender--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
bender--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
you
specifically
with
respect
to
this
case,
do
you
have
any
quarrel
with
judge
phillips,
who
said
in
dissent
that
if
we
were
starting
from
scratch
we
could
have
in
this
area
what
we
couldn't
have
in
the
race
area,
that
is,
genuine
freedom
of
choice
plan,
where
you
would
have
a
vmi
for
both
sexes,
and
you
would
have
a
military
academy
for
men
and
a
military
academy
for
women,
and
we're
starting
them
all
on
the
same
day,
and
they
all
have
equal
funding
and
equal
engineering
and
math
programs.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
doesn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this...
we
have
vpi,
which
as
i
understand
it
is
coeducational,
and
we
have
vwil,
which
is
one
sex,
and
vmi,
which
is
the
other
sex.
why
doesn't
that
fit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
terms
of
opportunity,
is
that
what
the
concentration
is
on
when
the
government
is
urging
that
vmi
admit
people
of
both
sexes?
is
it
the
adversative
method
that's
the
key?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bender--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
bender,
one
brief...
the
women
in
the
military
made
a
point
that
i
didn't
notice
the
government
making,
and
i'm
wondering
what
your
position
is
on
it,
and
that
concentration
was
on
the
men,
not
the
women,
and
the
point
was
that
if
women
are
to
be
leaders
in
life
and
in
the
military,
then
men
have
got
to
become
accustomed
to
taking
commands
from
women,
and
men
won't
become
accustomed
to
that
if
women
aren't
let
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
olson,
didn't--
--why
not?
wasn't
that
what
virginia
in
fact
had
until
1972?
it
had
the
charlottesville
facility
virtually
reserved
to
men.
the
curiosity
is
that
you
are
defending
single
sex
education
when
virginia
itself
abandoned
single
sex
education
in
all
schools
but
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
demands
from
whom?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
just
to
clarify,
virginia
didn't
choose
to
do
that,
because
you
are,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
defending
keeping
things
just
as
they
were.
you're
defending
the
judgment
that
you
wanted
to
get,
which
is
vmi
for
all
males,
and
no
public
program
for
women.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
are
we...
is
that
first
judge...
your
brief,
the
cross
appeal,
do
we
take
that
as
being
moot?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
are
those
the
only
choices?
one
choice
might
be...
i
think
you
said
in
your
brief
that
the
state
is
committed
to
vwil
and
that
you
will
have
that...
even
if
you
emerge
a
total
winner
you're
going
to
still
defend
that
program.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
have
that
program
at
mary
baldwin.
mary
baldwin
will
continue
to
exist
even
if
vmi
either
goes
private
or
admits
women.
you
could
still
support
the
program
that
you've
just
now
instituted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
couldn't
you
continue
with
vwil
no
matter
what?
i
mean
in
the
interest
of
diversity,
in
creating
citizen
soldiers,
leaders--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--creating
more
women
who
have
that
capacity,
couldn't
you
continue
vwil?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
that,
because
you
set
yourself
at
a...
you're
assisting
a
program
at
a
private
school
for
the
reason
of
promoting
diversity,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
olson,
how
do
you
factor
in
title
ix?
as
i
understand
it,
virginia,
having
abandoned
all
of
its
public
women's
colleges
for
whatever
reason,
cannot
now
set
one
up.
my
understanding
is
that
title
ix
grandparents
schools
like
vmi,
but
doesn't
permit
the
institution
of
new
single
sex
schools.
is
that
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
text
of
the
statute
says
something
about
if
you've
been
that
way
from
the
beginning--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
can
continue,
but
that
new
schools
cannot--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
there
no
interpretation
of
that
by
the
department
of
education?
i
don't
have
the
text
of
the
statute
in
front
of
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
are
guidelines
under
title
ix.
it's
not
covered
in
the
guidelines,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
was
just
curious
whether
by
statute
virginia
is
impeded
from
setting
up
a
public
college.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
if
we
think...
concentrating
on
virginia,
i
was
struck
by
the
resemblance
of
some
aspects
of
this
case
to
the
case
against
the
university
of
virginia
charlottesville.
that
never
came
to
this
court
because
it
settled,
but
the
three
judge
court
there
did
make
two
points,
and
one
was
that
the
university
of
charlottesville
couldn't
continue
all
male
because
there
were
educational
opportunities,
opportunities
for
education
at
that
facility
uniquely
that
were
not
available
to
women
in
the
women's
colleges
and
elsewhere.
and
the
second
point
that
was
made
by
that
three
judge
court
in
that
litigation
was
that
there
exists,
because
of
history,
a
prestige
factor
at
the
charlottesville
facility
that
was
not
matched
by
the
other
institutions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
a
private
school.
you
mentioned
in
public
colleges
two
women's
colleges,
the
one
in
texas,
the
one
in
new
jersey,
if
it's
douglas,
is
part
of
a...
close
to
the
rutger's
campus,
with
total
cross
registration.
any
male
can
take
a
course
in
douglas,
as
i
understand
it,
and
any
woman
can
take
a
course
at
rutger's.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
all
imaginary.
what
we
have
here
and
now
is,
we
have
two
all
male
public
colleges,
they're
both
military
schools.
we
have
nothing
comparable
for
women,
with
the
exception
of
this
program
just
started
up
in
response
to
a
court
decree.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is,
wouldn't
something
else
work
almost
as
well
without
denying
opportunity
to
anyone?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
an
incomparable
military
college,
the
virginia
military
institute
(vmi),
the
sole
single
sex
school
among
virginia’s
public
institutions
of
higher
learning.
since
its
founding
in
1839,
vmi
has
produced
civilian
and
military
leaders
for
the
commonwealth
and
the
nation.
the
school’s
unique
program
and
unparalleled
record
as
the
leadership
training
ground
has
led
someone
in
to
seek
admission.
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
women
capable
of
all
the
activities
required
of
vmi
cadet
instituted
this
lawsuit
in
1990
maintaining
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
virginia
may
not
reserve
exclusively
to
men
the
educational
opportunities
that
vmi
affords.
the
case
has
had
a
long
history
in
court.
in
the
first
round,
the
district
court
ruled
against
the
united
states
reasoning
that
the
all
male
vmi
served
the
state
policy
according
a
diverse
array
of
educational
program.
the
fourth
circuit
vacated
that
judgment
concluding
that
a
diversity
policy
serving
to
favor
one
gender
did
not
constitute
equal
protection.
in
the
second
round,
the
lower
courts
considered
a
found
satisfactorily
to
remedy
virginia
proposed,
a
program
for
women
called
the
virginia
women’s
institute
for
leadership
or
the
vwil
at
a
private
women’s
college
mary
baldwin
college.
a
vwil
degree,
at
the
fourth
circuit
said,
would
not
carry
the
historical
benefits
and
prestige
of
a
vmi
degree
and
the
two
programs
deferred
markedly
in
methodology,
vmi
is
vigorously
adversative,vwil’s
would
be
cooperative.
but
overall,
the
lower
courts
concluded
these
schools
were
sufficiently
comparable
to
meet
the
demand
of
equal
protection.
we
reverse
that
determination.
our
reasoning
centers
on
the
essence
of
the
complaint
of
the
united
states
and
on
facts
that
are
undisputed.
some
women
at
least
can
meet
the
physical
standards,
vmi
imposes
on
men,
are
capable
of
all
the
activities
required
of
vmi
cadets
prefer
vmi's
methodology
over
vwil
could
be
educated
using
vmi’s
methodology
and
would
want
to
attend
vmi
if
they
had
the
chance.
with
recruitment
the
district
court
recognize
vmi
could
achieve
at
least
10%
female
enrolment
a
number
the
district
court
said
sufficient
to
provide
female
cadets
with
a
positive
educational
experience.
if
most
women
would
not
choose
vmi’s
adversative
method,
many
men
too
would
not
want
to
be
educated
in
vmi’s
environment.
the
question
before
us
however
is
not
whether
women
or
men
should
be
forced
to
attend
vmi
rather
the
question
is
whether
virginia
can
constitutionally
deny
to
women
who
have
the
will
and
capacity
the
training
and
attendant
opportunity
vmi
uniquely
affords;
training
and
opportunity
of
the
vwil
program
does
not
supply.
to
answer
that
question,
we
must
have
a
measuring
rod
what
lawyers
call
a
standard
of
review.
in
a
nutshell
this
is
the
standard
our
precedent
establishes.
defenders
of
sex-based
government
action
must
demonstrate
an
exceedingly
persuasive
justification
for
that
action
to
make
that
demonstration.
the
defender
of
a
gender
line
must
show
at
least
that
the
talents
classification
served
important
governmental
objective
and
that
any
discriminatory
mean
employed
is
substantively
related
to
the
achievement
of
those
objectives.
the
heightened
review
standard
applicable
to
sex-based
classification
does
not
make
a
proscribed
classification
but
it
does
mark
as
presumptively
invalid
incompatible
with
equal
protection
a
law
or
official
policy
that
denies
to
women
simply
because
they
are
women
equal
opportunity
to
aspire,
achieve,
participate
in,
and
contribute
to
society
based
upon
what
they
can
do.
under
this
exacting
standard
reliance
on
overbroad
generalization
typically
male
or
typically
female
tendency
estimates
about
the
way
most
women
or
most
men
are
will
not
suffice
to
deny
opportunity
to
women
whose
talent
and
capacity
place
them
outside
the
average
description.
as
this
court
said
in
mississippi
university
for
women
against
hogan
some
14
years
ago
state
actors
may
not
close
entrance
gates
based
on
fixed
notions
concerning
their
roles
and
abilities
of
males
and
females.
a
remedial
decree
must
two
of
the
constitutional
violations
in
this
case,
the
violation
is
the
categorical
exclusion
of
women
from
an
extraordinary
educational
leadership
development
opportunity
afforded
men.
to
cure
that
violation
and
to
afford
genuinely
equal
protection,
women
seeking
and
set
forth
a
vmi
quality
education
cannot
be
offered
anything
less.
we
therefore
reversed
the
fourth
circuit’s
judgment
and
the
remand
the
case
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
scalia
had
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
