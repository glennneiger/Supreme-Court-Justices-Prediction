justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
you
read
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
the
assessment
of
those
findings
in
the
court
of
appeals,
what
is
your
understanding
of
those
courts'
conclusions
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
adversative
method
would
be
altered
and
affected
by
the
admission
of
women?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
have
the
institutional
competence
at
this
level
and
are
we
required
in
order
to
decide
this
case
to
make
our
own
assessment
of
the
extent
to
which
the
adversative
method
a)
would
change
and
b)
whether
that
change
would
be
detrimental
to
the
school?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
for
us
to
decide?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
you
want
us
to
make
that
predictive
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as...
to
the
extent
we're
talking
about
the
remedy,
i
suppose
we'd
have
a
certain
leeway
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
only,
mr.
bender,
is
there
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
an
open
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
strict
scrutiny
is
inconsistent
with
what
i
thought
you
told
justice
scalia,
and
i'd
like
to
explore
with
you
for
just
a
moment
that
you
say
there
are
certain
values
to
single
sex
schools,
say
at
the...
let's
talk
about
the
secondary
level
for
a
moment.
is
it
unreasonable
for
parents
to
choose
a
single
sex
school
for
a
high
school--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--girl
or
a
high
school
boy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
does
that
comport
with
strict
scrutiny,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
how
does
the
first
part
of
your
statement
square
with
your
urging
strict
scrutiny?
how
can
single
sex
high
schools,
say,
comply
with
the
doctrine
of...
the
rule
of
strict
scrutiny?
i
just
don't
think
they
can.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
olson...
mr.
olson,
i'd
like,
when
we're
talking
about
goals,
to
get
back
to
the
question
justice
souter
asked,
because
i
was
very
interested
in
your
answer.
i'm
not
sure
you
were
able
to
complete
it.
does
the
adversative
method
produce
a
different
product
than
the
west
point
method?
i
think
the
government
is
in
effect
trying
to
say,
don't
worry
about
changing
vmi
because
the
product
will
be
very
good.
it
will
be
like
west
point
in
annapolis,
and
those
are
marvelous
products.
is
there
something
in
the
adversative
method
that
produces
a
different
quality
leader?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
that
was
the
thrust
of
his
question,
and
i
wasn't
sure
what
the
answer--
