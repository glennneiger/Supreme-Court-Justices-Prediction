mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
vmi,
the
virginia
military
institute,
was
established
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
in
1839
as
a
state
college
for
young
men
between
the
ages
of
16
and
25.
initially,
its
students
were
cadets
who
were
assigned
to
guard
the
state
militia
arsenal
in
lexington,
virginia,
where
vmi
is
located.
vmi
since
that
time
has
remained
a
state
institution
and
in
1989-'90,
for
example,
it
contributed,
the
state
contributed
about
$10
million
to
vmi's
operating
budget,
that's
about
35
percent
of
the
budget,
and
the
board
of
visitors
of
vmi,
which
decides
things
like
its
admissions
policy,
is
appointed
by
the
governor
and
confirmed
by
the
legislature.
although
it
has
remained
a
state
institution
in
that
way
it
has
also,
at
the
same
time,
enormously
broadened
its
educational
mission
so
that
it's
no
longer
just
a
place
to
produce
cadets
for
the
military.
indeed,
today
only
about
15
percent
of
vmi
graduates
enter
the
military.
vmi
graduates
enter
the
professions,
law,
medicine,
engineering
quite
a
lot,
public
service
quite
a
lot.
while
restricting
vmi
to
men
might
have
been
inevitable,
indeed
required
at
the
time
vmi
was
initially
established
because
the
military
at
that
time
was
all
male,
as
vmi's
mission
has
broadened
that's
obviously
no
longer
true.
vmi
nevertheless
has
continued
only
to
admit
men,
and
continues
only
to
admit
men
until
this
day.
during
the
150
years
or
more
of
vmi's
existence,
it
has
developed
what
everyone
concedes
is
a
unique,
adversative
method
of
education.
it
is...
was
developed
in
an
all
male
context,
and
it
is
stereotypically
a
male
form
of
education.
it
emphasizes
adversity,
it
emphasizes
competition,
it
emphasizes
standing
up
to
stress,
it
emphasizes
the
development
of
strong
character
in
the
face
of
adversity,
of
self
reliance,
of
self
confidence.
the
vmi
degree
has,
through
that
unique
method,
become
a
very
valuable
asset
in
two
ways,
i
think.
first
of
all,
it
demonstrates
that
the
person
who
has
the
degree
has
succeeded
in
a
highly
adversative
environment.
many
people
value
that
when
looking
for
leaders
and
looking
for
people
to
hire.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
there's
general
agreement
on
what
would
have
to
be
changed
by
the
admission
of
women
in
physical
terms.
i
think
there
isn't
agreement
about
how
to
characterize
that.
for
example--
mr.
paul
bender
--there
is
not
agreement
about
how
to
characterize
the
change.
i
think
the
main...
there
is,
for
example,
general
agreement
that
for
privacy
reasons,
if
women
were
admitted
to
vmi
there
would
have
to
be
an
opportunity
for
women
and
men
to
go
to
the
toilet,
to
shower,
to
dress,
without
being
seen
by
members
of
the
opposite
sex.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
don't
think
that's
necessary
in
this
case.
as
you
say,
another
change
that
is
said
would
have
to
occur
is
a
change
in
the
adversative
method,
and
that
is
something
that
i
don't
think
is
true,
and
that
you
can
only
reach
that
conclusion
that
a
change
would
have
to
be
in
the
adversative
method
by
accepting
certain
stereotypical
characterizations
of
men
and
women.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
i--
mr.
paul
bender
--they...
that
finding
was
based
entirely
on
a
stereotypical
view
of
women
and
men
which
says
that
women...
men
cannot
administer
the
adversative
method
to
women,
women
would
not
be
able
to
survive
with
the
adversative
method.
mr.
paul
bender
expert
testimony
was
in
turn
based
on--
mr.
paul
bender
--exactly
those
characterizations.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
they
can't
be
dismissed
as
stereotypical,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
bender
it
means
what
the
experts
really
said,
which
is
not
that
all
women
can't
do
this,
but
that
most
women
can't
do
this,
and
we
are
willing
to
accept
the
finding
that
most
women
can't
do
this.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether,
because
most
women
can't
do
it,
you
are
constitutionally...
the
state
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
exclude
all
women--
mr.
paul
bender
--even
those
women
who
can.
mr.
paul
bender
it
has
to
do
with
whether
men
will
perceive
that
women
can
take
the
heat.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
don't
think,
just
as
in
the
area
of
race--
mr.
paul
bender
--just
as
in
the
area
of
race,
an
institution
would
not
be
able
to
remain
uniracial
by
saying,
if
you
let
black
people
into
vmi,
white
students
would
not
feel
comfortable
in
applying
the
adversative
method
to
them,
or
the
other
way
around,
if
you
let
white
students
into
an
all
black
institution
that
has
an
adversative
method,
black
people
will
not
feel
comfortable
in
applying
the
adversative
method
to
them.
mr.
paul
bender
just
as
that
cannot
be
used,
this
can't.
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
bender
what
i'm
saying
is
that
even
if
you
accept
them
as
opinions
of
what
might
be,
1)
that
they
are
not
opinions
that
are
universal...
no
one
could
say
that
men
universally
would
not
be
able
to
use
the
adversative
method
on
women,
and
to
me
more
fundamentally
it
rests
upon
men
having
a
certain
perception
of
what
women
are
capable
of.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
want
you
to
make
the
predictive
judgment.
i
think
what
this
court
is
called
upon
to
decide
is
whether
a
state
institution
can
model
its
program
and
its
exclusion
of
women
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
certain
things
that
women
can't
do
in
general,
there
are
certain
things
that
men
will
not
do
with
women
because
those
men
think
that
women
are
not
capable
of
that,
can
model
its
institution
and
its
educational
method
on
the
notion
that
this
educational
method,
developed
by
men,
emphasizing
what
they
think
of
as
manly
qualities,
is
a
place
that
women
can't
go,
so
that
women
cannot
demonstrate
that
they
have
the
same
qualities.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
they
can
model
their
institutions
on
that
with
regard
to
single
sex
education.
mr.
paul
bender
because,
justice
scalia,
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
not
simply
a
single
sex
institution
for
men
and
a
single
sex
institution
for
women
that
are
equal
in
their
treatment
of
their
students,
in
their
objectives,
in
their
feelings
about
men's
and
women's
capabilities.
what
we
have
here
is
a
single
sex
institution
for
men
that's
designed
as
a
place
to
teach
manly
values
that
only
men
can
learn,
to
show
that
men
can
suffer
adversity
and
succeed,
and
a
single
sex
institution
for
women--
mr.
paul
bender
--that
is
openly,
expressly,
deliberately
designed
to
teach
to
women
womanly
values,
feminine
values.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
we
are
not
challenging...
we
are
not...
it
may
be
difficult--
mr.
paul
bender
--that
one
is
that,
and
that
the
other
is
quite
a
different
thing
which
teaches
different
values
and
which
teaches
different
capabilities
in
the
students.
in
thinking
about
this
case,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
paul
bender
the
court--
mr.
paul
bender
--justice
o'connor,
the
court
has
said
repeatedly,
i
think
on
five
different
occasions
over
the
last
10
years
or
so,
that
the
question
of
the
standard
to
be
applied
to
gender
discrimination
is
an
open
question,
and
so
we
thought
that
the
question
might
come
up
of
asking
us
what
we
thought
the
right
standard
is.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
whether...
whether...
the
court
has
decided--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
that
did
not--
mr.
paul
bender
--that's
right,
but
since
then
the
court
has
said--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
court
has
said
it's
an
open
question
whether
there
should
be
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny.
mr.
paul
bender
the
court
has
never
found
it
necessary--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it
is
not.
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--you...
assuming
that
you
can
have
single
sex
education
that
represents
an
equal
opportunity
to
both
sexes,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
have
single
sex
education
that
offers
to
men
a
stereotypical
view
of
this
is
what
men
do.
this
is
a
profession
that
men
go
into.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think
there
are
two
questions
with
regard
to
the
extent
of
the
strict
scrutiny
doctrine.
our
submission
here
is
that
in
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
occurs
in
this
case,
which
is
offering
a
distinctly
different
opportunity
to
men
and
women
based
on
their
gender
alone,
should
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
i
think
in
the
gender
area,
unlike
the
race
area,
the
court...
there's
a
question
the
court
needs
to
decide
before
deciding
whether
all
gender
classifications
would
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
in
the
race
area,
the
court
has
made
the
decision
that
racial
classification,
racial
separation
is
inherently
unequal.
the
court
has
never
faced
that
question
except
in
the
vorchheimer
case,
which
was
affirmed
by
four
to
four
as
to
whether
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
gender
area.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
mr.
paul
bender
you're
giving
them
each
the
same.
what
you
can't
do,
justice
scalia,
is
say
we're
going
to
have
a
single
sex
school
for
men
which
is
the
engineering
school,
and
it's
the
only
engineering
school
we
have--
mr.
paul
bender
--and
we're
going
to
have
a
single
sex
school
for
women
which
is
a
nursing
school.
mr.
paul
bender
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
paul
bender
if
they're
equal.
mr.
paul
bender
because
they
are
enormously
different
programs,
in
two
ways.
one,
the
nature
of
the
program
is
different.
none
of
those
other
institutions,
vpi
or
vwil,
have
the
adversative
method
that
vmi
has
developed
as
a
way
of
testing
one's
ability
to
survive
adversity.
mr.
paul
bender
it
is
two
things,
it
is
the
adversative
method,
and
it
is
the
value
of
having
the
vmi
degree
as
a
mark
of
your
ability
to
survive
that
program
as
a
member
of
the,
up
until
now,
brotherhood
of
vmi
graduates.
the
vmi
degree
means
a
lot.
it
means
you've
survived
the
system.
vmi
has
developed
a
reputation
for
producing
tough
leaders.
what
this
system
does
is
preclude
women
from
getting
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--qualification.
mr.
paul
bender
it
might
be
justified
in
saying
that,
but
then
i
think
it
would
have
to
permit
the
women
and
the
men
to
go
to
the
same...
that
is,
they
couldn't
vindicate
their
single
sex
education
interest
in
that
context.
mr.
paul
bender
the
single
sex
education
interest--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
i...
that's
right,
justice
souter.
i
may
have
misspoke,
or
miscommunicated
in
answering
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question.
i
was
assuming
his
question
was
of
a
vmi
like
vmi
and
a
vwil
like
vwil,
that
is,
a
vwil
program
that
didn't
have
the
adversative
method,
that
was
premised,
as
vwil
is
explicitly
premised
in
its
planning
documents,
on
the
statement
that
women
cannot
handle,
most
women
cannot
handle--
mr.
paul
bender
--that
method.
mr.
paul
bender
then
it's--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
i
think
it's
very
hard...
i
agree
completely.
it's
very
hard
to
prejudge
how
such
a
system
would
work
out.
before
the
court
makes
a
judgment
about
whether
a
particular
system
like
that
would
be
valid,
i
think
it's
really
important
to
see
the
system,
to
see
what
the
state's
reasons
are
for
setting
it
up,
to
see
what
the
differences
are,
in
order
to
see
whether
there
is
this
explicit,
as
here,
or
implicit
assertion
that
women
are
not
suitable
for
certain
things.
mr.
paul
bender
it
would
depend,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
on
whether
the
separate
programs
were
simply
women
sleeping
in
some
room
set
aside
for
women
but
still
having
the
barracks
experience
which
is
central
to
the
vmi--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
we
would
not.
mr.
paul
bender
in
fact,
we
assume--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
when
you
say
their
own
separate
track,
i--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
that
i
don't
think--
[laughter]
that
i
don't
think
would
work,
because
the
thing
that
women,
the
opportunity
that
women
are
not
given
in
virginia
is
to
show
that
they
can
do
it
on
a
level
with
men.
mr.
paul
bender
but
it's
not
with
men.
i
think
one
of
the
powerful
things
that's
going
on
here
by
excluding
women
from
vmi
is
the
message
that
women
cannot
compete
in
an--
mr.
paul
bender
--if,
as
justice
souter
says,
it
doesn't
express
a
state
notion
of
inferiority
of
women,
and
i
think
that,
coupled
with
the
history
of
vmi,
that
men
have
developed
this
adversative
method,
to
then
say
that
women
are
not
going
to
be
permitted
to
show
that
they
can
succeed
in
that
same
environ...
in
thinking
about
this
case,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
bender
--they
said
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
planning
documents--
[laughter]
--says
that
it's
not
appropriate
for
most
women.
our
point
is
not...
we
don't
quarrel
with,
because
i
think
it's
unknowable,
whether
it's
appropriate
for
most
women
or
not
most
women.
our
point
is
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
say
to
a
particular
woman
who
says
i
want
that
training,
you
can't
have
it
solely
because
you're
a
woman.
in
thinking
about
this
case,
justice
scalia,
i've
tried
to
relate
it,
as
we're
all
trying
to
relate
it
to
our
own
situations
and
things
we're
familiar
with.
i've
tried
to
relate
it
to
something
that
i've
had
some
experience
with,
which
is
legal
education.
and
i
thought,
what
if
a
state
set
up
a
state
law
school
in
1839,
all
for
men,
because
at
that
time
only
men
could
be
lawyers,
and
over
150
years
it
developed
an
extremely
adversative
method
of
legal
education,
the
toughest
kind
of
socratic
teaching,
tremendous
time
pressures,
tremendous
pressures
in
exams,
tremendous
combativeness
by
the
faculty,
tremendous
competitiveness
among
the
students,
and
developed
a
reputation
for
that.
and
the
graduates
of
that
school...
and
it
was
a
place
that
was
known
as
hard
to
succeed
at,
and
a
third
or
so
of
the
people
flunked
out
in
the
first
year,
and
the
graduates
of
that
school
who
survived
that
process
became
known
as
expert
leading
lawyers
and
judges
in
that
state
and
nationwide.
and
then
as
women
came
into
the
legal
profession
and
started
to
apply
to
the
school,
to
ask
it
to
change
its
admission
policy,
the
school
made
a
judgment
that
most
women
really
wouldn't
be
comfortable
in
this
environment,
and
the
faculty
would
have
trouble
cross
examining
them
in
the
same
way
they
cross
examine
women,
and
other
students
would
have
difficulty
relating
to
them
in
the
same
competitive
way,
and
so
it's
better
not
to
let
women
into
the
school.
what
we'll
do
is,
we'll
set
up
a
new
women's
law
school,
and
it
won't
have
the
tough
socratic
method,
it
will
have
a
much
warmer,
a
much
more
embracing
environment,
and
it
won't
have
large
classes
with
a
lot
of
pressure,
it
will
have
seminars,
and
it
won't
have
tough
exams,
it
will
have
papers,
and
things
like
that--
--and
every
woman
has
to
go
to
that
law
school,
and
no
man
can,
and
no
woman
can
go
to
the
old
law
school.
i
think
we
all
understand
that
that
is
not
by
any
means
equal
treatment
of
women
with
regard
to
their
access
to
the
legal
profession.
mr.
paul
bender
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
paul
bender
we
disagree
with
that,
and
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
if
possible.
i
think
the
principal
basis
for
the
state's
and
vmi's
assertion
that
it
would
destroy
vmi
to
permit
women
to
come
in
is
the
finding
which
we
have
mentioned
before
that
the
adversative
method
is
unsuitable
to
women,
and
therefore
we
couldn't
continue
to
use
the
adversative
method
at
vmi.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
no
woman
will
be
successful
with
the
adversative--
mr.
paul
bender
--my
response
is
the
characteristics
of
the
institution
would
not
have
to
be
different
if
women
were
admitted.
mr.
paul
bender
they
are
clearly
erroneous
insofar
as
they
have
made
a
decision
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
carry
on
the
adversative
method
with
women
in
the
institution.
i
think
the
reason
they're
clearly
erroneous
is
because
that
finding,
it
can
only
be
based
upon
an
overgeneralization
that
women
would
not
be
able
to
deal
with
it--
mr.
paul
bender
--or
that
the
men
would
have
such
respect
for
women
that
they
wouldn't
do
that.
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that
a
state
is
entitled
to--
mr.
paul
bender
--and
i
think
that's
true
not
only
in
the
military
but
it's
true
in
the
professions,
it's
true
in
corporate
leadership.
i
don't
think,
justice
scalia,
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
you
can
have
male
schools.
i
don't
think
you
can
have
male
schools
that
are
fundamentally
different
in
their
educational
approach--
mr.
paul
bender
--that
only
males
can
go
to.
mr.
paul
bender
we...
yes.
we
look
at
it
both
ways.
i
don't
think
you
can
assume
that
the
adversative
method
would
have
to
be
changed,
but
even
if
you
assume
that
the
adversative
method
would
have
to
be
changed,
unless
the
adversative
method
is
essential
to
what
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
institution
is,
producing
citizen
soldiers,
then
the
state
has
to
make
that
change
in
the
adversative
method
in
order
to
accommodate
women
in
that
citizen
soldier
program.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
not
at
all.
first
of
all,
of
course,
you
haven't
decided
the
private
single
sex
education
for
reasons
that
i
think
are
clear,
but
even
with
regard
to
public
single
sex--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
the
court
state
action
cases
since
norwood
i
think
have
made
very
clear
that
simply
giving--
mr.
paul
bender
--can
states
give
money--
mr.
paul
bender
--to
racially
segregated
schools?
under
this
court's
state
action
cases
i
think
they
can.
mr.
paul
bender
norwood
was
a
different
situation.
mr.
paul
bender
norwood--
mr.
paul
bender
--it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
in
norwood--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes.
in
norwood--
mr.
paul
bender
--it
was
a
school
system
under
a
desegregation
decree.
[laughter]
coming
back
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
if
i
may,
certainly
a
compensatory
program
that
is...
has
a
compensatory
reason
to
compensate
for
prior
discrimination,
for
example,
could
be
a
single
sex
program
that
would
be
for
only
that
gender
because
only
that
gender
has
a
need
for
that,
so
at
least
in
those
two
areas--
mr.
paul
bender
--you
could
have
that.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
also
true,
right.
that's,
i
think,
the
third
part
of
the
answer.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
single
sex
education
that
a
state
proposes
for
single
sex
reasons,
unlike
this
case,
where
this
is
done
just
to
comply
with
a
court
decree,
if
a
state
proposes
a
single
sex
system,
the
issue
then
is,
is
it
truly
an
equal
system,
and
that
would
have
to
be
decided.
justice
o'connor,
with
regard
to
the
remedial
question
you
raised
before,
i
just...
can
i
finish
the
sentence?
mr.
paul
bender
that
might
be
more
difficult
if
it
were
voluntary.
i
think
in
the
remedial
context,
there's
a
lot
of
problem
with
that
kind
of
total
separation
unless
it's
necessary.
thank
you.
