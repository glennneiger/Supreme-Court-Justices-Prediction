well
then,
why
couldn't
you
say
exactly
the
same
thing
about
ethnic
or
racial
or
any
other
kind
of...
religious,
i
mean,
somebody
could
have
a
school,
and
they
say,
we're
keeping
a
religious
group,
ethnic
group
or
whatever,
out
of
our
public
school
because
we
have
a
certain
unique
kind
of
education
that
focuses
on
certain
curricula
in
a
certain
way,
and
once
they're
in
here
they'll
change
the
nature
of
that
curricula
because
they
won't
have
the
same
backgrounds,
et
cetera,
and
therefore
we
will
lose
this
unique
kind
of
curriculum,
method,
et
cetera,
that
we
had
in
the
past,
and
there
would
be
some
truth
to
that.
i
mean,
don't
we
have
to
look
at
the
importance
of
this
thing?
it
may
be
you
don't
have
exactly
the
same
rat
line.
maybe
you
don't
have
exactly
the
same
hazing
type,
but
not
complete
hazing
activity.
that
may
be
true
with
any
ethnic
group
coming
into
a
school,
any
religious
group,
any
kind
of
a
group.
isn't
the
answer
to
that,
so
what?
you'd
have
to
show
that
it's
important
enough
to
maintain
this
adversative
process,
and
what
is
it
in
this
record
that
shows
it's
important
enough
to
maintain
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
overcome
the
answer
to
a
woman
who
says
i
want
to
go
there?
i
want
to
go
there.
i
want
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
it
wouldn't.
maybe
you
wouldn't
have
precisely
the
same
system
with
ethnic
groups,
racial
groups,
et
cetera,
but
my
question
is,
what
is
it
that's
so
important
about
this
really
hard
to
grasp
adversative
thing
that
warrants
saying--
[laughter]
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious
about
it,
either.
i
want...
i'm
serious
about
it.
what
is
it
that
is
so
important
about
it
that
enables
you
to
say
to
a
young
woman
i'm
very
sorry,
even
though
you
want
to
go
there
and
you
want
this
result,
you
can't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
that
as
a
given.
what
i'm
asking
is,
what's
so
important
about
that
particular
rat
line,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
have
the
same...
are
you
getting
my
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
even
a
woman
who
says,
i
understand
that,
but
for
me,
she
says,
for
me,
i
think
it
would
work
better
at
vmi,
and
it
may
be
true
as
to
her,
irrespective
of
the
majority,
mightn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
a
very
quick
question,
which
is,
the
main
point,
single
sex
education
will
disappear
if
we
adopt
your
brief
word
for
word.
suppose
you
decided
that
you
needed
single
sex
academies
in
inner
cities.
if
we
adopt
your
brief
word
for
word,
have
we
decided
that
case?
