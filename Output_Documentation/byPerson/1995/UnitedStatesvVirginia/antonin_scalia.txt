justice

scalia
didn't
both
of
the
lower
courts
make
that
finding,
that
the
effect
of
admitting
women
would
be
to
destroy
the
adversative
method?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
say
that's
wrong,
but
both
of
the
lower
courts
found
that,
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
based
on
expert
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
see.
all
of
these
experts
are...
can
be
dismissed
as
stereotypical.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
stereotypical
mean?
when
anybody
comes
out
and
says
something
that
is
what?
what
makes
it
stereotypical?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
recall
the
experts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
was
not
that
women
can't
do
it,
it
was
that
it
would
interfere
with
the
kind
of
relationship
among
the
students
that
produces
the
adversative
method,
that
men
and
women
would
not
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
adversariness
that
men
and
men
or,
perhaps,
women
and
women
would,
that
the
sexual
difference
would
make
a
difference.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
women
can
take
the
heat.
that's
not
what
the
experts
testified
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
stereotypical,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
it
model
it
on
the
assumption
that
many
experts
testified
to
that
single
sex
education
has
certain
advantages--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
at
least
some
men
and
for
at
least
some
women?
can
it
model
it
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
alone
enough
to
support
this,
then?
never
mind
the
military,
never
mind
the
adversariness,
it's
a
men's
college.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.--
--i
don't
understand
that.
you're
not
challenging,
then,
the
ability
of
a
state
to
run
a
single
sex
college.
that
is
not
part
of
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
it
says
here
is
that
it's
a
single
sex
military
adversarial
college,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait
a
minute.
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
you're...
you
started
by
saying
that
single
sex
schools
would
be
okay
so
long
as
you're
not
depriving
anybody
of,
you
know,
essentially
the
same
things,
but
then
you
say
that
you
may
be
depriving
somebody
of
essentially
the
same
things
if
you
don't
let
a
woman
go
to
a
man's
school
or
a
man
go
to
a
woman's
school.
is
that
what
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
depriving,
certainly,
the
woman
of
a
men's
school
education,
or
the
man
of
a
woman's
school.
is
that
enough
of
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
they
could
do
it
in
a
separate
institution.
i
thought
you
said
before
if
they
had
a
fully
adversative
experience
in
a
totally
separate
institution,
that
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
basis
for
saying
that
the
committee
that
set
up
this
alternative
institution,
vwil,
decided
not
to
have
the
same
adversative
method
that
vmi
has
because
it
thought
women
couldn't
handle
it,
as
opposed
to
the
fact,
which
is
what
they
said,
that
they
thought
not
enough
women
would
be
interested
in
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
not
at
all
denigrating.
it
shows
to
my
mind
that
they're
pretty
smart.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
whether,
in
fact,
those
findings
that
the
law
school
would
be
destroyed,
that
its...
in
the
hypothetical
you
pose,
those
findings
are
obviously
absurd.
those
findings
are
not
absurd
in
the
context
of
vmi.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it
would
destroy
the
nature
of
the
institution.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
have
any
male
schools,
i
guess,
because...
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
gather
your
point
is
that
it
wouldn't
alter
the
program
academically,
but
it
would
alter
the
participant's
capacity
to
benefit
from
the
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
a
lot
of
parents
for
many
years
have
spent
a
lot
of
money
to
send
young
men
to
military
schools
who
supposedly
needed
the
discipline
that
military
training
provides
without...
surely
that's
worth
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
judgment
of
parents--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
of
the
state
that
establishes
such
institutions
that
it's
worth
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
only
private
single
sex
education
that
gets
any
assistance
from
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
states
give
money
to
segregated
schools,
racially
segregated
schools,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
position
of
the
justice
department--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
states
can
provide
funding
to
racially
segregated
schools?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
astounding.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
you
can
do
it
case
by
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
by
a
lawsuit.
