no,
mr.
bender,
i
think
the
toughest
finding
is
the
one
that
says
if
you
allow
women
in,
you
won't
be
able
to
have
the
same
success
with
the
adversative
method,
and
therefore
women
can't
get
what
they
seek.
that's
the
thing
that
was
the
hang
up
for
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
isn't
whether
it
will
be
successful.
the
point
of
the
finding
that
the...
i'm
wondering
if
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
the
district
court
finding
that,
in
concluding
if
they
were
to
require
the
admission
of
women,
so
forth
and
so
on,
the
very
opportunity
they
sought,
because
it
would
not
be
available
to
them
because
the
characteristics
of
the
institution
would
be
different,
and
what's
your
response
to
that
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying,
then,
that
the
court
of
appeals
misconstrued
the
district
court's
findings,
or
that
the
district
court's
findings
were
clearly
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
may
i
ask
you
right
there
a
question
that
has
troubled
me
right
along
about
this
argument?
i
assume
there
are
all
sorts
of
people
who
would
like
single
sex
education
but
who
would
not
like
to
go
through
the
adversative
method.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
virginia
do
for
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
does
it
do
for
the
male
who
wants
to
go
to
an
all
male
school
but
not
vmi?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
then
saying
there
are
fewer
males
who
want
single
sex
education...
most
of
those
would
like
the
vmi
program
rather
than
a
less--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
if
most
people
who
want
single
sex
education
don't
want
vmi,
it's
discriminating
against
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
help
the
young
man
who
doesn't
want
the
adversative
method
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
would
assume
that
most
men
who
want
single
sex
education
don't
want
the
rigorous
training.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
olson,
that
didn't
go
to
academics,
because
there's
a
square
finding
that
the
academic
program
would
not
be
affected
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
only
the
adversity
and
all
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--special
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
go
to
academic
achievement.
it
only
goes
to
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--special
ethos
at
vmi.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
their
finding
is
that
on
academics
it
makes
no
difference.
there's
a
square
finding
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
academically
or
otherwise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
finding
on
page
212a
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition
says
squarely
the
presence
of
women
in
the
institute
would
not
alter
the
program
academically.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
one
flaw
in
your
presentation
that
troubles
me.
you
haven't
given
the
people,
the
women
who
go
to
the
other
school,
the
same
adversative
program
that
you
say
is
essential--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yet
you
say
there's
a
difference
between
men
and
women.
