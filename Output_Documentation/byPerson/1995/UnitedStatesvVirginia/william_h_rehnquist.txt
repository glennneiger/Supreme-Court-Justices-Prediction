the
standard.
chief

open
question?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bender--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--supposing,
as
justice
ginsburg's
hypothesis,
we
were
starting
from
scratch,
or
virginia
was
starting,
and
they
opened
vmi
for
men
and
a
vmi
for
women,
and
200
men
signed
up
to
go
to
the
vmi
for
men,
and
10
women
signed
up
to
go
to
the
vmi
for
women,

we
just...
there's
