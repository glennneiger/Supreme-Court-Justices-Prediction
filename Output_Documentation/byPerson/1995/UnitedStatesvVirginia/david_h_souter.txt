justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
that
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
that
be
true...
would
that
be
true
if
there
were
no
implication
of
inferiority?
doesn't...
isn't
the,
sort
of
the
essential
part
of
your
case
the
assumption
that
everybody...
certainly
that
you
were
making.
i
guess
your
opponents
are
not...
that
the
fact
that
the
course
is
not
offered,
the
adversity
training
is
not
offered,
is
in
the
real
world
in
which
we
live
an
indication
of
an
implicit
judgment
of
inferiority.
if
there
were
no
implicit
judgment
of
inferiority,
if
we
were
sort
of
starting
on
the
world's
first
morning,
your
answer
might
be
different,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but...
right--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if
we
were
starting
sort
of
at
square
1,
and
the
college
for
men
did
not
offer
a
course
in
home
economics
and
the
college
for
women
did
not
offer
adversative
training,
if
there
were
no
reason
in
that
kind
of
a
world
to
assume
that
there
was
an
implication
of
inferiority
either
against
men
or
against
women,
you
would
not
make
an
equal
protection
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
bender,
does
the
government's
case
turn
on
the
degree
of
modification
or
change
that
the
admission
of
women
would
make
to
this
adversative
method,
or
does
the
government's
case
essentially
turn
on
the...
on
a
more
complex
analysis,
and
that
is
the
degree
to
which
the
present
adversative
method
can
be
said
to
be
essential
to
some
different
kind
of
leadership
training
than
is
produced
in,
say,
west
point
or
annapolis,
that
don't
have
these
things?
because
i
was
assuming,
and
i
guess
i'm
handing
you
something,
and
maybe
you
will
not
want
it,
but
i
was
assuming
that
even
if
we
say,
yes,
the
adversative
method
is
going
to
be
modified
in
some
obvious
respects
if
women
come
in,
that
that's
not
the
end
of
the
issue.
the
issue
is,
does
that
destroy
the
capacity
of
vmi
to
produce
a
distinctive
kind
of
leader
that
nobody
else
is
producing
by
another
method?
is
that
latter
way
the
way
you
look
at
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question
about
liability?
i
think
this
is
implicit
in
what
you're
saying,
but
i
don't
want
to
make
a
mistake.
i
understand
that
you're
defending
vmi's
position
on
liability
essentially
by
arguing
the
basis...
by
arguing
that
the
combination
of
single
sex
education
and
adversative
method
is
sufficiently
valuable
to
be
the
state
interest,
the
important
state
interest
which
justifies
what
it's
doing.
i
do
not
understand
you
to
be
arguing
that
this
combination
of
single
sex
education
and
adversative
method
is
somehow
essential
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
broader
objective
of
producing
a
distinctive
kind
of
leader
who
can
be
distinguished,
for
example,
from
the
sort
of
leaders
that
west
point
produces
and
annapolis
produces.
am
i
right
that
your
justification
on
liability
ultimately
is,
this
is
a
good
way
to
educate
people,
as
distinct
from,
we
are
producing
a
kind
of
leader
who
could
not
otherwise
be
produced?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
olson,
with
respect
to
the
value
of
single
sex
education,
are
there
ways
to
identify
in
advance
the
students
from
a
broad
mass
of
17-year-olds
who
would
benefit
from
a
single
sex
education
from
those
who
would
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
should
say,
there's
nothing
but
self
selection--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
take
it,
going
on
here
to
match
the
students
with
the
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
olson,
i
think
you're
saying
not
that
there
is
a
distinctive
difference
in
the
product,
but
that
there
is
a
distinctive
difference
in
the
method
of
education
which
is
suited
to
the
people
who
go
there,
and
that
really
does
not
answer
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
put
the
question,
or
subsume
the
question
in
something
else.
it
is...
isn't
it
true
that
the
district
court
judge
never
made
any
finding
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
kind
of
leadership
product,
if
you
want
to
use
that
term,
that
vmi
produces
from
what
west
point
or
annapolis
or
the
other
military
schools--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
which
goes
to
the
point
which
you
made
quite
candidly,
that
you
are
resting
your
case
essentially
on
the
position
that
this
is
a
valuable
method
of
education
because
it
serves
a
distinct
group
of
people.
you
are
not
resting
your
case
on
the
proposition
that
it
is
necessary
to
produce
a
distinctive
kind
of
leader
who
is
produced
by
it
and
can
only
be
produced
by
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
say--
--but
if
it--
--there's
no
stereotype,
but
isn't
it
the
case,
as
justice
breyer
said,
that
if
you
are
going
to
justify
your
system
by
its
distinctness,
then
you
always
have
a
built
in
justification,
because
you
can
say,
if
you
change
it,
it's
no
longer
distinct,
the
value
is
gone,
and
that's
why,
it
seems
to
me,
under
middle
tier
scrutiny,
you've
got
to
say
the
distinctness
is
worth
it
for
some
other
reason.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
would
suppose
you
could
go--
justice
david
h.
souter
--one
step
further.
i
thought
you
could,
consistently
with
your
position,
and
that
is,
if
you've
got
a
school
system
in
which
everybody
says
the
results
are
terrible
for
everybody,
and
the
school
system
made
a
decision
that
in
fact
they
would
get
better
results
for
everybody
if
certain
classes
at
certain
levels
were
segregated
by
sex,
all
males
schools
and
all
female
schools,
you
wouldn't
start
with
this
implication
of
inferiority,
and
i
would
suppose
that
that
might
be
okay.
