mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
although
the
government
has
tried
virtually
everything
in
its
power
to
deny
it,
this
case
involves
the
inescapable
central
question
of
whether
the
states
can
support
single
sex
education.
while
98
percent
of
virginia's
higher
educational
resources
go
into
coeducation,
educators
are
virtually
united,
both
the
government's
experts
and
the
experts
for
the
respondents,
that
many
young
men
and
young
women
significantly
benefit
from
a
single
sex
education.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
virginia
has
done
is
devote
98
percent
of
its
educational
resources
to
single...
to
coeducation,
and
it's
created
two
single
sex
education
programs--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
problem,
justice
stevens,
is
that
you
cannot
create
a
school
without
an
adequate
student
body,
and
resources
are
limited,
and
the
government's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
i'm
saying
is,
virginia
has
allocated
a
certain
amount
of
its
scarce
educational
resources
to
single
sex
education.
it
has
turned
to
experts
in
education--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
what
the
judge...
unless...
as
long
as
the
state
is
going
to
be
permitted
to
have
single
sex
education
at
all,
then
it
must
turn
over
to
experts
in
education
the
best
method,
to
divine
the
best
method
that
would
succeed
for
the
young
men
or
the
young
women
that
seek
out
and
would
benefit
from
single
sex
education.
that
is
what
virginia
has
done.
this
system
that
vmi
has
developed
works
well
for
young
men.
the
experts--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i...
the
marketplace
in
part
comes
into
play
here,
and
the
fact
that
resources
are
limited.
virginia
could
not
create
a
single
sex
educational
school
for
young
men
that
wanted
an
adversative
system
and
a
single
sex
education
for
young
men
who
wanted
a
less
than
a
co...
adversative
system.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the...
there
were
a
number
of
women's
only
public
schools
in
virginia
that
chose
themselves
to
go
to
coeducation
because
of
the
demands
that
occurred
and
that
the
trends
that
were
away
in
the
seventies--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
trends
that
were
away
from
single
sex
education.
the
fact
is
that
a
growing
body
of
experts
throughout
the
country
are...
continue
to
develop
the
belief
that
single
sex
education
is
valuable
for
some
young
people.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there's
no
stereotypes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it...
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
was
the
posture--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is
the
posture
of
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
point
at
which
time
that
liability
decision
comes
up
is
a
point
at
which
virginia
is
providing
public
resources,
pursuant
to
two
constitutional
amendments,
to
private
schools.
five
private
schools
in
virginia
provide
single
sex
education
for
women,
and
the
state
of
virginia
is
supporting
those
programs
at
that
time,
and
there
is
not
a
sufficient
demand
at
that
point
in
time
to
create
a
separate
institution.
now,
virginia
is
nonetheless,
despite
the
fact
that
it
feels
that
that
program
is
defensible,
because
when
the
states
choose
to
develop
and
finance
a
program
that
is
for
the
benefit
of
people
of
one
gender,
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
create
the
exact
program
for
the
other
gender
if
there
isn't
a
sufficient
demand
or
need
for
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
it
does,
and
there
are
essentially
three
choices
here.
what
virginia
has
chosen
to
do
is
to
provide
single
sex
education
designed
by
experts
to
serve
the
people
who
need
and
want
and
would
benefit
from
single
sex--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
at
the
time
of
that
liability
decision,
virginia
had
a
choice
to
make.
virginia
made
the
choice
to
create
a
remedy
in
response
to
the
liability
decision,
and
then
virginia
had
three
choices.
as
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
it
is
not
moot.
we
are
defending
that
position.
what
we
are
saying,
however,
because
justice
o'connor
has
asked
the
question,
an
entirely
appropriate
question,
suppose
you
are
not
successful
on
that
point,
and
suppose
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
and
that
there
must
be
a
remedy,
what
should
that
remedy
be?
we
are
saying
that
the
state
of
virginia,
or
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
had
three
choices.
it
could
eliminate
single
sex
education
at
all,
altogether,
by
allowing
men...
by
allowing
women
into
vmi,
and
i
will
come
back
to
this
point,
but
that
would
change
the
system
at
vmi,
and
there
wouldn't
be
single
sex
education.
in
other
words,
it
would
deprive
both
men
and
women
of
the
benefit
of
single
sex
education.
or
it
could
have
created
an
absolutely
identical
institution
like
vmi
or
at
vwil
or
at
some
other
place,
maybe
even
at
vmi,
but
the
fact
is
that
the...
we...
the
state
of
virginia
put
that
decision
in
the
hands
of
experts,
how
best
to
design
the
program.
the
experts--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
if
vmi
went
private,
then
the
state
of
virginia
would
no
longer
be
supporting
through
its
public
resources
in
the
same
way
single
sex
education
for
young
men.
if
single
sex
education
is
only
available
through
private
schools,
it's
only
available
to
the
wealthy,
the
people
who
can
afford
it,
and
there
are
findings
in
the
record
here
that
people
that
benefit
the
most
from
and
derive
the
most
benefit
from
single
sex
education
are
people
that
are
not
in
the
upper
income
strata.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you
could
continue
it
with...
well,
i
submit
that
if
this
court
decides
that
the
vmi
program
is
unconstitutional
because
it's
unique
and
has
its
own
tradition
and
faculty
and
that
sort
of
thing,
then
a
single
sex
program
that
denies
men
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
that
program
will
be
held
unconstitutional
on
exactly
the
same
grounds.
what
virginia
has
attempted
to
do
is
if
it
has
accepted--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
effort
is,
by
virginia
is
to
promote
diversity
by
creating
opportunities
in
a
very,
very
large
coeducational
system
for
people
of
both
sexes
to
make
the
choice
of
single
sex
education.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
well,
it
provided
tuition
assistance
grants
to
the
five
single
sex
colleges
for
women.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
sure
that
the
record
is
completely
clear,
but
the
single
sex
institutions
for
women
in
virginia
derive
something...
i
believe
the
record
indicates
something
between
5
and
10
percent
of
their
resources
from
either
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government,
plus
there's
the
factor
that
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government
provide
tax
deductions--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
was
smaller
in
total
amounts.
the
amount
coming
from
the
state
of
virginia
itself,
if
you
eliminate
federal
assistance--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
was
going
to
those
programs,
it
was
smaller
than
the
amount
by
which
virginia
supported
vmi.
vmi
on
an
annual
basis
gets,
as
mr.
bender
pointed
out,
about
9...
he
said
10,
but
i
believe
the
figure
is
closer
to
$9
million,
which
is
about
30
percent
of
vmi's
revenues,
resources
per
year.
the
bulk
of
vmi's
resources
per
year
on
an
operating
basis
come
from
students
in
the
form
of
tuition,
or
from
other
sources.
thirty
percent
comes
from
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
our
point,
with
respect
to
the
remedy,
and
i
would--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
i
agree
with
you,
and
let
me
restate
it
as
i
understand
it.
what
virginia
has
decided,
and
the
experts,
both
the
government's
experts
and
the
private
experts
agree,
that
single
sex
education
is
valuable
for
some
young
people
of
both
sexes,
and
there's
no
stereotypes
whatsoever
made
in
that
conclusion.
and
so
then
virginia
has
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
education...
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
most
important
function
that
a
state
can
perform
is
educating
its
young
citizens.
now,
as
a
matter
of
educating
its
young
citizens
and
performing
that
important
governmental
function,
single
sex
education
should
be
an
important
part
of
that.
virginia
has
turned
the
creation,
the
design,
and
the
operation
of
those
programs
over
to
the
people
who
have
spent
their
entire
life
deciding
how
best
to
educate
young
people,
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
think
that
that
has
been
definitively
decided,
and
i
can't
cite
the
case
for
you,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
believe
that
the
one
case
that
has
dealt
with
the
issue
has
suggested
that
a
new
system
that
is...
there's
a
single
sex
system
from
its
beginning
would
meet
the
definition
in
20
u.s.c.
1681
(5),
that
the
words
traditionally
and
continually
from
its
inception
may
be
interpreted
to
apply
to
a
new
institution,
but
that
question
has
not
been
decided
by
the
courts.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
words
of
the
statute
say,
that
traditionally
and
continually
from
its
establishment
has
been.
now,
the
vwil
program
will
be
continuously
and
from
its
establishment
a
single
sex
institution.
the
only--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
not
aware
of
any.
i
am...
i
looked
into
that
question
in
preparation
for
the
argument
and
i
read
a
case
in
which
a...
i
don't
think
it
was
a
college
program
but
a
high
school
program
or
something
of
that
sort...
maybe
it
was
a
college
program...
was
created,
and
that
was
the
interpretation.
i
know
of
nothing
inconsistent
with
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
well,
i
don't...
it
wasn't...
this
case
was
a
constitutional
case,
and
title
ix
has
not
been
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
believe
that
virginia
is
not.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
souter.
i
suspect
that
that's
one
of
those
decisions
that
are
made
by...
there
are...
it's
a
self
selective
process
between--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--based
upon
what
i
know,
those
tests
that
they
give
people
to
decide
whether
you
might
do
best
in
that
sort
of
situation
usually
are
not
as
successful
predictors
as
the
students
and
the
parents
themselves.
our
point
with
respect
to
the
methodology,
if
i
can
continue
to
answer
your
question,
is
that
the
educational
experts
have
not
made
decisions
that
men
can't
do
this
or
women
can't
do
that,
or
women
won't
be
any
more
successful
or
any
less
successful
in
one
type
of
institution
or
another,
but
that
the
experts
know
how
best
to
educate
young
people.
the
experts
that
set
up
the
vwil
program
said
we
could
have
created
an
institution
that
looked
very
much
like
vmi.
we
did
not
feel
it
would
be
right
to
design
a
program
based
on
litigation
considerations
because
we
know...
and
this
is
in
the
record...
we
know
how
best
to
design
a
program
for
young
people.
if
we're
going
to
have
a
single
sex
educational--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
academic
program
itself
is...
would
not
be
affected,
and
in
fact
the
academic--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
the
environment
in
which
the
students
learn.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
the...
in
fact--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
it
results
in
academic
achievement,
but
you're
correct,
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there's
a
finding
in
the
record,
and
i
can't
give
you
the
page
number,
to
the
effect
that
people
succeed
better
in
a
single
sex
educational
program
across
the
board,
both
young
men
and
young
women.
they
do
better,
they
achieve
more,
including
the
academics--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--academically
and
otherwise.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
that
the
evidence
and
the
findings
that
are
on
page
168
of
the
appendix,
167,
176,
pages
225,
page
125--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
apologize.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well--
[laughter]
let
me
start
with
page
176.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
agree
with
that,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
implicit.
i'm
not
sure
that
if
you
have
a
single
sex
education
that
you're
going
to
have
a
higher
distribution
of
a's,
and
i
don't...
as
opposed
to
b's,
c's,
or
d's.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
experts,
including
the
government
experts,
agreed
that
the
outcome,
the
student
learns
better,
becomes
more
successful,
and
i
believe,
justice
stevens--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
are
only
two
single
sex
male
college...
institutions
remaining
in
the
united
states,
and
that's
south
carolina--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
there
are
programs
in
new
jersey
and
in
texas
for
women
that
are
single
sex,
or
have
been
single
sex
programs.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
program
at
the
university
of
texas,
the
texas
program,
has
just
started
to
change
or
is
changing
and
becoming
a
coeducational
program.
many
states
do
support
some
level
of
single
sex
education
through--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
suspect
under
the
norwood
case
decided
by
this
court,
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
single
sex
education,
if
supported
by
a
state
completely,
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution,
the...
that
it
would
be
similarly
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
support
indirectly
through
tuition
grants
or
assistance
with
books,
and
possibly
even
tax
deduction--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
believe
that
you
have
that
unusual
intersection
between
the
first
amendment,
establishment,
and
free
exercise
clauses
that
may
make
a
difference
there.
the...
if...
there...
with...
if
there
is
a
finding
by
this
court
that
single
sex
education
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states,
the
norwood
case
seems
to
stand,
to
me,
for
the
proposition
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
but
my
point,
and
i
repeat
this
point,
that
if
virginia
cannot
support
single
sex
education
in
this
context
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
any
state
can
provide
support
for
single
sex
education,
because
virginia
has
done
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
if
i...
if
i
may
answer
the
latter
part
of
that
question
first,
one
would
hope
that
if
single
sex
education
can
exist
in
this
country
and
receive
public
support,
that
every
single
sex
institution
will
have
prestige,
it
will
be
unique.
yes,
vmi
is
unique
and
it
does
have
prestige,
but
so
does
the
mary
baldwin
program,
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--our
point,
justice
ginsburg,
is
if
single
sex
education
at
the
college
level
can
exist,
one
would
hope
that
it
would
be
very
good
education,
that
a
single
sex
institution
for
boys
or
young
men
here
would
be
a
distinguished,
successful
place
that
anybody
would
want
to
go,
and
the
same
would
be
true
of
a
program
like
vwil,
that
it
would
be
distinguished,
unique.
even
if...
and
i
come
back
to
this,
but
that
if
you're
going--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
this
program,
the
courts
below
have
examined
this
program
and
found
that
the
goals
are
the
same
and
that
the
outcome
will
be
the
same,
and
that
this
will
be
a
successful
program.
hopefully
this
program
will
be
so
successful
and
continue
to
be
so
successful...
and
it
already
is
unique,
and
it
does
deny
the
opportunity
for
admission
to
young
men.
if
we're--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--let
me
put
it
this
way--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question.
it's
a
very
good
question.
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
best
answered
this
way,
is
that
because
we
are
each
different,
we
each
respond
to
different
educational
methods
and
different
educational
stimuli.
the
west
point
program
is
designed
to
create
officers
of
the
united
states.
the
vmi
program
is
designed
to
create
leaders
and
adults
who
can
operate
in
the
civilian
or
in
the
military
world,
who
have
a
sense
of
responsibility,
the
same
goals,
in
other
words,
that
the
vwil
program
is
set
up
to
do.
the
fact
is
that
some
young
people
do
very
well
in
a
coeducational
program,
and
come
out
the
other
end
to
be
successful.
some
young
men
and
some
young
women
aren't
successful
in
coeducational
programs.
they
are
distracted.
there's
a
million
things
that
can
go
on
in
those
programs--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
well,
i
think
that...
i
am
saying
that,
and
if
i'm
not
answering
the
question,
i'm
not
understanding
the
question.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
but
it
did
make
a
finding
that
this
system
and
this
methodology
works
for
the
people
that
go
to
that
school,
and
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
agree
with
you,
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
evidence--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
that
system
would
not
exist
in
the
company
of
co--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
answer...
the
experts
testified,
and
people
who
are
professional
educators,
who
have
spent
their
life
in
education,
saying
that
the
system
could
not
exist.
it
would
fundamentally
have
to
be
changed.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
the
answer
is
that
it
works,
justice
breyer,
in
a
single
sex
environment
for
young
men.
now,
given
the
opportunity
to
design
something
exactly
identical
to
that,
the
people
who
spent
their
life
in
education
designing
a
system
for
young
women,
and
the
government
experts
really
don't
disagree
with
that,
say
we
know
what
would
work,
we
would
know
what
would
attract
sufficient
numbers
of
people--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--a
choice
would
have
to
be
made,
since
the
system
would
fundamentally
have
to
be
altered
in
the
presence
of
coeducation.
it
will
not
work.
it
may
work
well
with
just
women.
it
may
work
well
with
just
men,
and
there's
no
stereotypes
associated
with
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
distinction...
the
distinctiveness
is
worth
it
because
young
people
educate
differently
and
we
must,
in
this
society,
find
ways
to
educate
them
successfully,
and
we
must
develop
systems,
not
a
student
body
for
each
student,
but
systems
that
will
attract
people,
and
according
to
the
experts,
not
to
the
lawyers,
work
well
for
young
people.
now,
that
is
worth
it.
that
is
an
exceeding...
this
court
has
said
that
is
the
most
important
governmental
function
for
state
and
local
governments.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
experts
across
the
board,
and
the
government
did
not
deny
this,
that
single
sex
education
for
substantial
numbers
of
people
work
best,
and
the
program--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--unless
we're
all
to
be
educated
the
same,
and
unless
we
abandon
single
sex
education,
we
ought
to
allow
those
programs
which
work
to
be
designed
by
experts--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
the
experts--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
works
for...
experts
tell
us
that
young
men
who
want
a
single
sex
education
succeed
in
that
environment,
and
the
experts
that
designed
vwil
say
that
that
program
will
produce
the
same
results.
