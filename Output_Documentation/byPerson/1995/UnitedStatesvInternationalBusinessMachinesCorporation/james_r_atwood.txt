mr.
james
r.
atwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
holding
of
michelin
and
washington
stevedoring
which
the
government
is
relying
on
so
heavily
in
this
case
is
that
impost
did
not
mean
tax.
the
key
holding
in
michelin
was
that
impost
referred
to
a
subcategory
of
taxes,
those
taxes
which
are
of
a
customs
nature.
those
are
the
cases
the
government's
relying
upon,
and
now
they're
turning
the
rationale
of
that
case
inside-out.
impost
and
tax
in
some
instances
are
used
synonymously,
but
rarely,
and
certainly
the
jurisprudence
under
these
clauses
has
been
absolutely
to
the
contrary.
even
chief--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--not
on
this
point,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
this
is
very
important.
i
think
the
government
has
put
together
in
a
way
that
ends
up
being
misleading
two
different
things
that
john
marshall
said,
chief
justice
marshall.
in
the...
where
he
said
the
clauses
are
similar,
he
was
addressing
the
issue
of
whether
a
tax
imposed
on
an
occupation
is
a
tax
on
an
import,
and
it
was
in
that
context
that
he
drew
an
analogy
to
the
export
clause
and
said
both
clauses
are
similar
in
that
they
use
similar
language
as
to
what's
prohibited,
what
act
is
prohibited
the
laying
on
of
a
tax.
that's
where
he
said
the
clauses
were
similar.
separately,
eight
pages
earlier,
he
addressed
the
difference
between
tax
and
imports.
justice
thompson...
you
may
remember
the
senate
in
that
case
saying
the
maryland
tax
was
a
tax,
not
an
impost,
and
therefore
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
import-export
clause.
marshall
rejected
that
argument
and
concluded
there,
to
quote
the
government's
reply
brief
on
page
12,
the
court
concluded
that
the
term
impost
is
not
used
in
a
narrow
or
fixed
manner,
but
generally
signifies
a
tax
levied
on
articles
brought
into
the
country,
so
we
agree
with
marshall's
statement.
i
think
his
statement
is
consistent
with
michelin
that
in
the
context
of
these
clauses,
impost
had
a
rather
specific
meaning.
thames
&
mersey
was
not
a
departure
from
existing
law
at
the
time.
the
court's
decisions
on
the
export
clause
have
been
perfectly
consistent.
they
have
said
from
the
beginning
that
federal
taxes
may
not
be
applied
to
the
export
process
itself.
they've
also
said
that
if
the
export
journey
has
not
begun,
such
as
in
a
manufacturing
tax,
then
the
issue
of
discrimination
is
important.
but
all
of
the
cases,
starting
with
turpin
v.
burgess,
have
said
that
you
can...
the
federal
government
cannot
tax
the
export
process
itself,
and
thames
&
mersey
is
squarely
within
that
line
of
authority.
now,
concerning
the
questions,
i
guess
justice
kennedy
raised
and
perhaps
justice
ginsburg,
as
to
whether
this
is
sufficiently
indirect
that
it's
not
a
tax
on
exports,
the
record
doesn't
reveal
the
sort
of
statistical
information
justice
breyer
was
suggesting
might
be
relevant
because
the
government
has
conceded
throughout
that
they
are
not
disputing
that
this
tax,
if
discriminatory,
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
they
are
not
challenging
that
aspect
of
thames
&
mersey.
they
haven't
challenged
it
throughout.
to
do
so,
they
would
have
to
challenge
not
just
thames
&
mersey,
they'd
have
to
go
back
and
challenge
chief
justice
marshall's
holding
in
brown
v.
maryland
that
a
tax
on
occupation
is
a
tax
on
an
import,
they'd
have
to
challenge
the
fairbank
decision,
which
they've
embraced
throughout
their
briefs,
which
involved
a
indirect
tax,
they'd
have
to
challenge
hvoslef,
they'd
have
to
challenge
thames
&
mersey.
and
the
reality
is
that
a
tax
on
insurance
is
very...
is
about
as
close
as
you
can
come
to
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
the
property.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
there
is
a
separate
premium--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--right.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--because
when
it
is
purchased
for
a
shipment
of
goods,
as
in
the
case
here,
there
is
a
separate
premium
charged
for
every
shipment.
every
box,
every
computer
that's
boxed
up,
a
separate
premium
is
charged
for
that
shipment
from
the
time
it
leaves
ibm's
plant
to
the
time
it's
delivered
abroad.
that
premium
varies
directly
with
the
value
of
that
product,
because
if
it's
an
expensive
machine
it
has
a
higher
premium
than
if
it's
an
inexpensive--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--the
extent
to
which
the
value
of
the
good
determines
the
premium
will
vary
with
the
length
of
shipment,
but
you
know,
the
longer
shipments,
longer
exports
are
taxed
more
than
shorter
shipments.
that
seems
to
us,
again,
to
get
back
to
a
direct
tax
on
the
export
process...
separate
premium
for
each
product,
it
varies
with
the
value,
it
varies
with
the
distance.
that's
a
tax
on
the
export
process.
it's
slightly
different--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--i
guess
the
way
this
tax
has
been
administered
is,
it
goes
from
one...
from
where
the
good
takes
off
from
where
the
good
lands,
and
in
terms
of
the
court's
jurisprudence
under
the
export
clause
and
under
the
import
clause,
i
think
they
treat
that
entire
journey
as
an
integrated
whole.
the
spalding
case
says
the
export
process
starts
when
you
turn
over
the
goods
to
a
common
carrier.
marshall,
you
recall,
in
brown
v.
maryland,
addressed
the
question,
does
the
import
and
export
only
occur
when
the
goods
cross
the
border?
he
said,
no,
it's
a
longer
process
than
that.
you
can't
apply
and
prohibit
an
import
tax
even
though
the
goods
are
now
in
the
united
states,
and
you
can't
apply...
this
was
his
hypothetical
under
the
export
clause.
you
can't
apply
the
export
clause
to
a
later
point
once
the
goods
have
left.
the
trip
is
an
integrated
journey.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
good
argument
that
that
tax
would
be
unconstitutional.
this,
i
think,
is
a
stronger
case,
because
you're
taxing
the
shipper,
and
clearly
the
premium
does
vary--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--it's
not
my
rationale,
your
honor.
this
is
what
the
court
held
in
thames
&
mersey.
this
has
been
the
court's
consistent
theory
of
how
the
export
clause
applies,
and
it
has
not
proven
to
be
a
problem.
we're
not
suggesting
some
novel
theory
that's
going
to
disrupt
the
republic.
the
export
clause
has
been
consistently
interpreted
for
more
than
200
years,
and
the
republic
has
survived
quite
well.
i
don't
think
this
is
going
to
create
enormous
problems
of
administration
for
the
courts.
it
hasn't
so
far.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
we
understand
congress'
objective.
it
was
twofold.
it
was
to
raise
revenue
and
it
was
to
plug
what
was
perceived
as
a
loophole.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
we
don't
think
the
perceived
problem
in
effect
authorizes
a
tax
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
that's
right.
there
are--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--it
does,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
tax
exemptions
in
our
laws.
you
can
make
arguments
for
or
against
almost
any
tax
exemption.
the
one
thing
that's
different
about
this
tax
exemption--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--is
it's
in
the
constitution--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--and
it's
in
the
constitution
because
the
framers
thought
it
was
important.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
i...
it
seems
to
me
the
court's
decision
on
that
aspect
in
thames
&
mersey
is
correct
and
has
been
conceded
by
the
government,
that
this
is...
this
bears
so
closely
to
the
export
process
that
it
is
a
tax
on
goods.
now,
congress
had
other
means
of
addressing
this
perceived
inequality.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
yes,
it
probably
could
say,
"buy
american".
it
could
also
provide
tax
relief
for
american
insurers.
it
could
also...
i
mean,
this
tax
was
passed
many
years
ago.
they
could
rethink
their
jurisdiction
over
foreign
insurers
and
whether
or
not
they
could
apply
the
income
tax
to
foreign
insurers,
which,
of
course,
would
be
constitutional
under
peck
v.
lowe,
so
congress'
hands
aren't
completely
tied,
but
they...
it
seems
to
us
they're
not
entitled
to
adopt
a
provision
contrary
to
the
constitution
to
try
to
solve
that
particular
problem.
the
court
has,
as
the
government
said,
construed
the
import-export
clause
and
the
export
clause
consistently
for
many
years.
going
back
to
chief
justice
marshall's
point,
i
think
there
the
consistency
is
not
one
that's
at
odds
here.
the
whole
point
of
the
export-import
clause
cases,
though,
was
to
break
that
link
between
the
two
clauses.
one
applies
to
taxes,
the
other
only
applies
to
imports
and
duties,
and
that
was
the
holding
of
the
cases,
that
under
the
import-export
clause
we
will
look
at
whether
the
tax
is
of
a
customs
nature,
and
you
cannot
apply
that
analysis
to
the
export
clause
and
come
to
the
government's
conclusion
here.
and
at
the
constitution,
there
was...
there
were
strong,
compelling
reasons
advanced
and
fought
over
very
hard
as
to
whether
or
not
exports
should
be
exempt.
it
was
one
of
the
closest
votes
at
the
constitutional
convention,
and
there
were
several
reasons
to
coalesce
behind
this
tax
exemption.
one
was
the
concern
of
the
southern
states
that
were
dependent
upon
the
export
economy.
there
were
also
those
from
new
england
that
thought
an
export
exemption
would
benefit
domestic
industries,
would
encourage
the
development
of
domestic
industries,
and
there
were
others
that
were
simply
concerned
about
the
scope
of
taxing
authority
being
given
to
the
united
states,
which,
of
course,
was
happening
now
the
first
time
at
the
convention.
that
came
together
to
result
in
a
tax
exemption,
which
is
clearly
written
and
was
intended
by
the
framers
to
be
very
broad,
and
there's
no
contemporary
evidence
from
that
constitutional
convention
that
impost
was
intended
to
be
synonymous
with
tax.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
i
think
the...
at
least
under
this
court's
holding
in
michelin
and
washington
stevedoring,
the
concept
of
discrimination
is
in
the
import-export
clause,
and
it's
in
it
because
of
the
words
duty
and
impost.
the
court
read
those
terms
to
mean
taxes
that
tax
imports
and
exports,
qua
imports
and
exports
that
are
focused
on,
that
discriminated
against
them
as
opposed
to
general
taxes,
so
that's
how
there
is
a
respectable,
indeed,
perhaps
strong
constitutional
basis
to
limit
the
import-export
clause
to
discriminatory
taxes.
that
same
analysis
just
doesn't
carry
forward
when
the
framers
used
the
generic
term,
tax,
in
the
export
clause.
and
you
go
back
to
franklin's
testimony,
ben
franklin's
testimony
to
the
house
of
commons
when
he
went
over
as
part
of
the
delegation
to
protest
the
stamp
act,
and
he
reminded
members
of
the
house
of
commons
that
in
the
united
states
tax
and
duty
very
often
had
different
meanings,
that
while
the
colonists
recognized
the
authority
of
parliament
to
impose
duties,
now
for
the
first
time
they
were
imposing
internal
taxes,
and
that,
franklin
said,
crossed
the
line
and,
of
course,
franklin
was
there
at
the
convention--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--that
was
not
the
analysis
the
court
applied
in
michelin
and
washington
stevedoring.
they
did
not
focus
on
the
laid-on
language
that's
in
the
import-export
clause
as
well.
they
said,
that
clause
is
narrower
and
different
because...
and
this
is
cited
on
page
xx
of
our
brief.
it's
from
423
u.s.
at
287.
imposts
or
duties
mean
essentially
taxes
on
the
commercial
privilege
of
bringing
goods
into
a
country,
and
then
they
applied
the
same
analysis
to
exports
in
washington
stevedoring.
that's
the
textual
basis
the
court
relied
upon,
and
they
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
analyzing
marshall's
opinion
in
brown
v.
maryland
to
reach
that
specific,
narrower
definition
of
impost,
and
that's
why
one
clause...
and
again,
the
background
as
well,
if
you
look
back
at
the
constitutional
convention,
clearly
the
import-export
clause
was
intended
to
prevent
discrimination.
the
export
clause
was
intended
to
provide
a
broad
tax
immunity.
the
framers
simply
did
not
think
it
proper
that
the
federal
government
burden
the
export
process.
that's
what
this
tax
does.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
concludes.
