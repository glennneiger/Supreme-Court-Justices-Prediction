we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-591,
the
united
states
v.
international
business
machines
corporation.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
are
they
synonymous?
why
did
the
framers
use
different
language,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
that
carries
you
very...
to
provide
and
maintain
a
navy,
you're
providing
ships,
whereas
to
raise
and
support
armies,
you're
conscripting
troops.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
even
though
the
case
itself
hasn't
been
followed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
leads
you
to
that
conclusion,
that
the
government
can
levy
a
tax
on
medicine
being
exported
if
it
has
gone
to
some
expense
to
test
it
in
this
country?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
say
it
can
levy
a
tax
on
the
medicine
itself
being
exported?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
the
constitutional
language
says
no
tax
or
duty.
now,
presumably
that
includes
more
than
just
a
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
we
do
that,
when
they're
two
different
clauses
and
different
language?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
minear.
mr.
atwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
atwood.
mr.
minear,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
certainly
the
result
of
the
cases
decided
under
the
export
clause.
it's
true
in
fairbank,
is
it
not,
and
certainly
in
mersey?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
it
was
true
in
thames
&
mersey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
thames
&
mersey
was
decided
in
1915,
and
i
don't
see
any
great
trouble
having
resulted
between
then
and
now
in
applying
the
export
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
