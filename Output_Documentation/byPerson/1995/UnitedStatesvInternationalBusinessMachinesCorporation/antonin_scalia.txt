but
you've
conceded
that.
you've
conceded--
--you've
conceded
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
problem's
over
the
falls,
right?
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
does
your
theory
not
require
us
to
figure
out
what
are
imports
and
what
aren't
imports?
even
to
decide
whether
a
tax
is
discriminatorily
placed
on
imports
you
have
to
decide
the
same
question.
let's
assume
you
have
a
task
that
is
only
placed
upon
insurance
of
exports.
wouldn't
you
still
have
to
decide
whether
that's,
in
effect,
a
tax
upon
exports?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
i
don't
see
how
that
question
is
eliminated
by
adopting
the
theory
that
you're
pressing
upon
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
i'm
just
skeptical
that
the
canny
southerners
who
got
this
provision
included
in
the
constitution
were
resigned
to
the
notion
that
if
a
tax
were
placed
upon
indigo,
it
would
be
up
to
the
courts
as
to
whether
that
was
a
discriminatory...
you
know,
upon
shipments
of
indigo.
it
would
depend
upon
what
percentage
was
being
exported,
and
that's
your
analysis,
right,
that
if,
in
fact,
almost
all
indigo
was
being
exported,
that
would
be
a
discriminatory
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
skeptical
that
that's
all
the
protection
the
southerners
thought
they
got
when
they
got
the
export
clause
included
in
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
well,
then
you're
being
inconsistent
in
your
analysis.
then
you
shouldn't
say
that
if
99
percent
of
indigo
is
exported,
a
tax
generally
on
the
sale
of
indigo
would
be
a
discriminatory
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
it?
if
they're
concerned
only
with
taxes
on
exports,
then
that
hypothetical
should
not
be
a
dis...
should
not
come
within
the
export
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
to
come
back
to
the
framers'
perspective,
i
note
in
your
reply
brief
even
justice
story's
description
of
the
word
impost...
i'm
coming
back
to
the
difference
between
the...
in
the
phrasing
of
the
two
clauses.
story's...
observes
that
it
is
sometimes
used
in
the
large
sense
of
taxes,
and
sometimes
in
the
more
restrained
sense
of
a
duty
on
imported
goods
and
merchandise.
that's
what
he
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
1833.
merriam
webster's
1828
dictionary
says
the
same
thing,
that
it
could
be
used...
well,
i'll
read
it.
any
tax
or
tribute
imposed
by
authority,
particularly
a
duty
or
a
tax
laid
by
a
covernment
on
goods
imported.
imposts
are
also
called
customs.
i
think,
given
the
difference
in
the
language,
why...
wouldn't
it
be
normal
to
give...
that
is,
between
taxes
in
one
clause
and
imports
and
exports
in
the
other,
duties
in
the
other.
wouldn't
it
be
normal
for
us
to
give
it
its
more
limited
meaning
here?
it
can
bear
a
more
limited
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
of
course
it
has
a
more
general--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
as
between
giving
it
the
more
general
or
giving
it
the
narrower,
giving
it
the
narrower
meaning
makes
it
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely...
i
mean,
you
have
john
marshall,
for
starters,
as
saying
that
the
two
clauses
mean
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
response
is
that
it's
the
fault
of
the
constitution.
the
constitution
favors
exports,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
congress--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
could
make
it
very
broad
and
still
adopt
the
manner
of
analysis
that
we've
used
for
the
import-export
clause.
that
is
to
say,
there's
no
necessary
connection
between
insisting
upon
discrimination
on
the
one
hand
and
applying
it
only
to
customslike
impositions
on
the
other
hand.
it
seems
to
me
that
distinction
doesn't
come
from
the
text
of
the
two
clauses,
does
it?
i
mean,
i
can
apply
it
broadly
to
all
sorts
of
taxes,
but
still
insist,
as
we
do
under
the
import-export
clause,
that
it
discriminate.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say,
i
just
don't
see
that.
it
seems
to
me
if...
we're
getting
the
discriminatory
notion
not
from
the
words
imports
or
imposts
or
duties
but
from
the
discrimination,
articles
exported.
is
it
a
tax
on
articles
exported
from
any
state
if
it's
a
general
tax?
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
it's
not
because
of
the
use
of
the
word
tax,
it's
because
of
the
phrase,
laid-on
articles
exported.
that's
where
you
get
the
discriminatory
content,
not
from
the
word
tax
versus
impost.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
once
again,
mr.
minear,
as
i
think
we
established
earlier,
you
will
enable
us
to
avoid
that
question
usually,
at
most,
because
we
can
decide
the
question
simply
on
the
basis
that
the
tax
is
not
discriminatory,
but
where
it
is
discriminatory
we
are
going
to
have
to
address
this
same
question
anyway.
you
are
not
eliminating
that
difficulty
from
our
jurisprudence.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
once
you
decide
it's
discriminatory,
you
are
then
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
it
is
laid
upon
the
process
of
export,
so
that,
you
know,
that
difficulty
that
you're
now
addressing,
it
isn't
eliminated
from
our
jurisprudence
entirely.
all
you
can
say
is
you
won't
have
to
face
it
as
often
as
you
now
do.
