are
you
concerned
that
the
original
package
doctrine
has
to
be
introduced,
or
something
like
it,
if
we
attempt
some
halfway
solution
where
we
rule
in
your
favor
saying
there
cannot
be
a
tax
on
the
export,
but
that
if
there
is
an
indirect
tax,
then
the
discrimination
rule
applies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
betrays
what
is
the...
betrays
your
argument
and
what's
of
concern
to
the
court.
you
say,
well,
that's
a
tax
on
manufacturing.
we're
right
back
into
asking
the
difference
between
a
tax
on
an
export
and
the
tax
on
manufacturing.
your
discrimination
rationale
does
not
save
us
that
inquiry.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
the
only
variable.
if
you
ship
from
chicago
to
toronto
i'm
sure
that
the
value
of
the
good
is
the
predominant
part
of
the
premium,
but
if
you
ship
from
an
ibm
headquarters
to
india
by
steamship,
i'm
sure
those
other
factors
are
much
more
significant
in
calculating
the
premium
than
the
value
of
the
goods.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
way
you
characterize
it.
you
might
also
say
that
that's
a
tax
on
the
insurance
aspect,
which
brings
us
back
to
what
we're
arguing
about.
i
suppose
that's
an
interesting
philosophical
question,
whether
you
continue
to
export
until
you
reach
india,
or
has
your
export
stopped
at
least
when
you
reach
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states?
i'm
not
sure
where
the
exporting
stops.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
a
tax
on
diesel
fuel
exempt
if
that's
a
major
portion
of
the
cost
of
exporting
the
item,
say
bulk
goods
such
as
wheat
or
corn?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
a
very
good
reason
for
me
to
worry
about
your
rationale.
