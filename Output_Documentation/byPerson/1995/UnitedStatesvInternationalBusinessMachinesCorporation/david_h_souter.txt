justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could,
in
this
case,
say
this
is
not
a
tax
on
the
goods
themselves,
and
then
invoke
your
antidiscrimination
principle,
leaving
a
tax
on
the
goods
themselves
for
another
day.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
spalding
case,
et
cetera.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
it
so
hard
in
this
case
to
do
that?
can't
we
reserve
the
difficult
question
for
a
later
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
you've
got
to
say
discriminatory
against
what,
and
to
determine
the
what,
you've
got
to
decide
whether
the
subject
of
the
tax
should
be
treated
as
an
export.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
away
from
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
isn't
just
disproportionality,
is
it?
weren't
they
concerned
with
the
fact
that,
if
there
was
a
tax
on
the
exports,
they
would
go
broke
one
way
or
the
other?
either
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
make
any
money
on
their
exports
or...
because
the
government
would
take
their
profit,
or
they
couldn't,
conversely,
sell
on
the
world
market
because
the
price
would
be
too
high,
and
it
wouldn't
have
been
any
consolation
to
them
whatsoever
to
find
that,
in
fact,
they
were
not
being
discriminated
against
within
sort
of
the
general
field
of
taxation
in
the
united
states.
they...
if
they
couldn't
do
business,
they
couldn't
do
business,
and
as
a
region
that
was
a...
basically
a
net
exporter
of
raw
materials,
it
was
the
ultimate
economic
effect
that
they
were
worried
about,
not
discrimination,
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
all
they
were
concerned
about,
then
they
didn't
need
the
clause
in
the
first
place.
i
mean,
they
wanted
that
clause.
they
were
not
taking
this
on
faith,
and
the
reason
they
wanted
that
clause
ultimately
turned
on
the
economic
effect
of
the
tax,
and
i
suppose
the
economic
effect
of
the
tax
is
going
to
be
exactly
the
same,
or
was
expected
to
be
exactly
the
same
whether
you
or
i
called
it
discriminatory
or
not.
i
mean,
isn't
that
a
fair
objection?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
it
say,
"buy
american"?
