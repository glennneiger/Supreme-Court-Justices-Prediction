so
if
the
south,
in
other
words,
exports
100
percent
of
its
indigo
crop...
no,
let's
say
only
99.99
percent,
and
congress
were
to
pass
a
tax
saying
all
shipments
of
indigo
pay
a
10
percent
tax,
in
your
view
that's
nondiscriminatory
and,
therefore,
at
the
time
this
constitution
was
enacted,
the
court
should
have
upheld
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
case
i
put?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
i
think
that
was
being
asked
is,
isn't...
don't
you
have
to
figure
out
whether
the
tax
is
on
an
export
or
not
even
under
your
analysis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
nondiscriminatory
means
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
do
we
have
to,
then,
look
at
the
percentage
of
the
thing
that's
exported
as
opposed
to
the
percentage
that
isn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
character
of
the
tax?
you
always
phrase...
you
know,
all...
nondiscriminatory,
rich
and
poor
can
sleep
under
the
bridges
of
paris.
nondiscriminatory.
all
indigo
is
taxed,
even
though
it
happens
to
be
the
case
that
99.999
percent
is
exported.
is
that...
how
do
you
avoid
looking
at
the
percentages?
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
let
me
ask
you
a
different--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i
ask
you
a
different
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
this
is
what
is
actually
worrying
me,
but
i
can't...
if,
it
seems
to
me,
if...
if,
and
it's
a
very
big
if,
a
tax
on
premiums
paid
to
foreign
insurers
who
have
no
u.s.
offices
for
casualty
insurance
is
in
fact
a
tax
on
the
item
that
is
insured,
then
we
are
to
look
to
this
as
a
tax
on
the
item
insured.
then
i
would
guess
it
is
relevant
as
to
how
many,
what
the
percent
of
items
is
that
buys
this
kind
of
insurance
that
is
exported,
and
i
would
imagine
it's
very,
very
high,
and
therefore
we're
back
to
the
99.9
percent
indigo.
what's
wrong
with
the
reasoning
i
just
said,
and
i
said
it's
a
very
big
if,
because
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
your
brief
has
assumed
the
if,
and
if
we're
supposed
to
go
into
the
if,
or
not
go
into
the
if,
how
do
we
go
into
it,
given
the
arguments
in
front
of
us
and
our
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
empirical
facts
that
underlie
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
take
it,
foreign
insurer
who
has
no
u.s.
office,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
must
not
be
very
normal
that
an
american
buys
insurance
casualty
from
an
insurer
who
has
no
u.s.
office
but
does
not
intend
to
ship
the
goods
so
insured
abroad.
i
mean,
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
just
satisfy
my
curiosity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
particular
question
would
be,
why
is
a
tax
on
a
premium--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
a
tax
on
a
premium
that
paid
for
an
insurance
policy
of
a
sort
that
exporters
might
buy
and
also
people
who
are
not
exporters
might
buy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
why
is
a
tax
that
is
applied
to
an
item
that
both
exporters
and
nonexporters
might
buy,
in
some
proportion
we
know
not
what,
why
is
that
a
tax
on
the
good
that
is
exported?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
that
weren't
so,
i
take
it
that
the
tax
in
washington
stevedoring
was
a
tax
that
wasn't
related
directly
to
the
value
of
the
goods.
it
was
on--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--services
and,
moreover,
the
tax
in
michelin,
i
guess,
was
a
tax
on
goods
that
weren't
in
transit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
i'm
not
certain
that
those
cases
really
are
contrary
to
thames
&
mersey
if
you
look
at
thames
&
mersey
as
a
case
where
the
incidence
of
the
tax
fell
directly
on
the
export.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
the
tax
in
washington
stevedores
was
on
the
service,
and
thus
wasn't
directly
related
to
the
value
of
the
good,
and
it's
therefore
a
tax
on
the
service,
not
on
the
good,
and
here
the
"big
if"
clause
that
i
said
before
means
we
have
to
assume
it's
a
tax
on
the
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
agree
that
we're
foreclosed
on
that,
because
you
conceded
it,
according
to
your
opponents.
