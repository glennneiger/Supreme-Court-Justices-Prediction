mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
4371
of
the
internal
revenue
code
runs
afoul
of
the
export
clause
of
the
constitution.
section
4371
imposes
a
generally
applicable
tax
not
limited
to
exports
on
premiums
paid
by
foreign
insurers
for
risks
that
occur
wholly
or
partly
within
the
united
states.
it
eliminates
a
competitive
advantage
that
foreign
insurers
would
otherwise
enjoy
by
virtue
of
their
exemption
from
the
federal
income
tax.
the
federal
circuit
ruled
that
the
export
clause
prohibits
the
application
of
that
tax
to
insurance
associated
with
exports.
they
concluded
that
this
court's
decision
in
thames
&
mersey
v.
united
states
compelled
that
result.
we
submit
that
this
court's
ruling
in
thames
&
mersey
is
no
longer
viable.
that
decision
was
a
departure
from
precedent
when
it
was
decided
80
years
ago,
and
it
rested
on
a
commerce-clause
rationale
this
court
has
since
repudiated.
but
perhaps
most
important,
thames
cannot
be
reconciled
with
this
court's
modern
tax
decisions,
which
have
worked
a
basic
change
in
the
law.
those
decisions,
michelin
tire
and
washington
stevedoring,
have,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
abandoned
the
past
practice
of
examining
when
goods
lose
their
character
as
imports
or
exports,
and
has
refocused
the
inquiry
on
the
nature
of
the
tax
at
issue.
using
that
approach,
the
court
has
concluded
that
the
import-export
clause
does
not
prohibit
the
application
of
generally
applicable
taxes,
but
rather
prohibits--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
possible,
but
we
do
not
think
it
is
borne
out
by
either
the
language
or
the
content
of
the
clause
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
we
have
made
that
concession
in
the
briefs.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
relatively
few,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
were
four
cases
that
were
decided
before
thames
and
mersey--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
harm
that
it
does
is,
it
results
in
a
lack
of
coherence
in
this
court's
overall
approach
to
the
problem
in
this
area.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
answer
both
of
the
questions,
both
of
the
points
that
you
made
there.
first,
this
court
has
consistently
interpreted
the
export
clause
and
the
import-export
clause
as
imposing
a
parallel
limitation
on
the
federal
and
state
governments
with
respect
to
exports.
if
there's
one
element
of
consistency
that
has
run
through
this
court's
cases
in
the
past
175
years,
it
is
that
those
two
clauses
should
be
interpreted
consistently.
and
secondly,
there
is
a
question
of
the
language
difference.
respondent
asserts
that
the
export
clause
should
be
read
as
a
more
extensive
prohibition
because
it
uses
the
term,
tax
or
duty,
rather
than
the
term,
impost
or
duty,
but
the
terms
tax
and
impost
are
synonymous,
and
the
operative
phrase
in
this
context
is
functionally
identical.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
framers
frequently
used
synonymous
terms
to
express
the
same
idea.
for
example,
the
framers
stated
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
raise
and
support
armies,
but
also
to
provide
and
maintain
a
navy.
it
said
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
establish
post
offices,
but
to
constitute
tribunals.
the
very
nature
of
a
synonym
is,
frequently
it
can
be
used
interchangeably
with
no
change
in
meaning.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
this...
the
overall
content
of
those
phrases,
they
convey
the
same
general
meaning,
and
that's
the
point
that
chief
justice
marshall
made
in
1827
in
the
case
of
brown
v.
maryland.
as
he
stated,
there
is
some
diversity
in
language,
but
the
act
that
is
prohibited
is
the
same,
and
that
provision,
that
statement
has
been
followed
by
this
court,
as
i
say,
in
numerous
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
case
itself
has
been
followed
in
significant
part.
it's
true
that
the
aspect
of
the
case
originally...
relating
to
the
original
package
doctrine
has
not
been
followed.
at
least
it
has
not
been
seen
as
a
restriction,
but
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case
is
that
what
the
respondent's
position
would
do
is
actually
reintroduce
the
very
notion
of
the
original
package
doctrine,
or
at
least
the
converse
of
it
in
the
sense
of
taxes
on
exports.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
that
is
a
problem,
that
we
believe
that
one
of
the
basic
points
in
this
court's
decision
in
michelin
tire
and
washington
stevedoring
was
to
abandon
that
type
of
inquiry,
this
inquiry--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
the
tax
was
applied
to
loading
and
unloading
the
ships.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
believe
that
that's
a
separate
problem
with
thames
&
mersey.
it's
another
problem
that
was
introduced
by
that
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
bigger
problem
is
the
one
that
we're
concerned
with,
and
that
was
the
application...
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
the
problem,
the
reason
why
we
chose
not
to
do
that
is
because
it
is...
it
requires
us
to
fall
back
onto
an
analysis
similar
to
the
original
package
doctrine.
what
is
an
export,
and
what
is
not
an
export?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
of
course
you
could
do
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
ought
to
be
addressed
now,
that
this
is
a
problem
that
has
continued
to
plague
this
area--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--then
you
might
well
have
to
face
that
question,
but
the
test--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
test
that
we
propose
will
eliminate
that
inquiry
in
most
every
case,
because
the
initial
question
will
be,
is
this
tax
discriminatory,
and
that's
a
question
that
can
usually
be
answered
quite
easily.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
if
a
tax
applies
across
the
board
to
all
types
of
transactions,
it
is
not
discriminatory,
so
you
do
not
need
to
get
into
the
question
of
what
is
an
export
and
what
isn't,
as
long
as--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
any
particular
tax
is
going
to
be
discriminatory
may
require
a
further
analysis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
at
the
moment
that
that
tax
is
imposed,
perhaps
it
is
a
tax
on
exports,
but
you
must
remember
that
markets
constantly
change.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
you
do,
but
you
can...
the
analysis
we
propose
simplifies
this
area
in
the
same
way
that
it
has
simplified
the
area
in
the
import-export
clause
cases
by
focusing
on
the
nature
of
the
tax.
if
the
tax
is
a
general
tax,
if
it
applies
across
the
board
to
all
of
the
products,
then
it
would
not
fall
within
the
purview
of
the
export
clause.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
do
not
mean
to
avoid
that
argument.
that's
part
of
our
argument
of
why
this
is
a
tax
of
general
application.
in
this
particular
context,
in
fact,
the
tax
appears
to
be
more
an
import
tax
than
an
export
tax.
remember,
this
is
a
tax
that
is
being
imposed
on
the
basis
of
foreign
insurers
selling
insurance
in
this
country
on
the
basis...
to
protect
against
risks
that
occur
wholly
or
partly
in
the
united
states,
but
our
argument
is
addressed
to
the
broader
problem
here,
and
that's
why
we
think
that
you
need
to
reconsider
thames
&
mersey.
the...
our
concerns
here
are
not
limited
to
just
this
case,
but
rather
to
add
incoherence
to
the
overall
body
of
law
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
could
be.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
would
be.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
if
we're
looking
to
what
the
framers
were
concerned
about,
i
think
that
the
convention
debates
indicate
they
were
concerned
about
export
taxes.
at
that
period,
they
were
familiar
with
the
types
of
taxes
that
were
commonly
imposed
on
trade
and,
during
that
era,
it
was
very
common
to
impose
a
tax
on
exports.
in
fact,
the
convention
debates
make
specific
reference
to
the
tax
that
france
imposed
upon
her
wines
and
brandies
that
were
exported
and
the
tax
that
england
imposed
on
its
woollen
products
as
well.
that
is
what
they
saw
as
the
danger...
a
tax
that
would
be
imposed
upon
exports
that
would
fall
disproportionately
on
the
southern
states
which
had
developed
an
export
economy.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
they
were...
they
realized
that
their
ultimate
protection
from
taxation
in
the
southern
states,
as
well
in
the
north,
lie
in
the
establishment
of
a
congress
composed
of
two
houses
that
would
provide
the
representation
that
would
give
weight
to
their
concerns.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
their
objection
was
actually
more
pointed.
it
was
to
the
notion
of
the
export
tax,
the
export
tax
that
they
were
familiar
with
that
they
saw
posing
a
serious
threat
to
their
economies
as
they
existed--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--my
view
on
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i'd
like
to
clarify
my
answer
on
that,
and
that
is
that
the
tax
on
an
object
that
is
100
percent
exported
might
very
well
be
a
discriminatory
tax
if
it's
a
pretext
for
imposing
a
tax
on
exports.
but
there
are
other
types
of
taxes
that
would,
in
fact,
fall
exclusively
on
an
exported
product,
yet
we
would
hesitate
to
call
them
an
export
tax,
and
let
me
give
you
the
example
of
a
medicine,
for
instance,
that
is
not
approved
for
use
in
the
united
states
but
is
approved
for
use
elsewhere,
and
as
a
result
it
is...
tends
to
be
exported.
congress
could
impose
a
tax
on
that,
i
believe,
without
violating
the
export
clause
to
cover
the
specific
cost
that
the
government
incurs
in
going
through
the
fda
approval
process,
and
that's
why
i
say
you
need
to
look
to
the
actual
purpose
of
the
tax--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
being
rendered
in
any
particular
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
by...
the
reason
for
that
is
because,
even
now,
the
congress
can
levy
that
type
of
tax
if
it's
a
tax
on
the
manufacturer
rather
than
at
some
later
point.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
can
levy
a
tax
on
the
medicine,
not
on
the
medicine...
what
i'm
saying...
my
point
here,
your
honor,
is
that
you
have
to
focus
on
the
specific
tax
that's
at
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
i...
oh,
i
think
that
it
can...
it
embraces
the
same
types
of
imposts
and
duties
as
are
included
within
the
import-export
clause.
our
view
is
that
there
was
no
difference
in
meaning
in
the
tax
and
duty
in
the
export
clause
and
the
impost
and
duty
in
the
import-export
clause.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
eliminates
the
inquiry
in
most
cases,
is
my
point
here.
in
virtually
all
cases
it
will
eliminate
that
inquiry.
we
look
to
whether...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
you
look
to
whether
the
tax
is,
in
fact,
nondiscriminatory,
and
if
the
tax
is
nondiscriminatory,
then
it
will
not
run
afoul
of
those
concerns
that
are
indicated
by
the
export
clause.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
a
tax
of
general
application
that's
applied
to
goods
across
the
board.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
i
think
that
in
the
usual
case
you'll
be
able,
as
in
this
case,
simply
to
look
to
the
character
of
the
tax.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
my
point
to
you
on
the
indigo
example
is,
we
would
not
say
that
you
are...
that
a
party
is
precluded
from
challenging
even
a
nondiscriminatory,
a
tax
that
on
it's
face
is
nondiscriminatory--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--on
the
basis--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
my
view
on
how
you
approach
the
question
is
as
follows.
you
look
at
the
tax,
and
how
the
tax
is
phrased.
the
tax
in
this
case
is
phrased
to
cover
all
casualty
insurance
that's
issued
by
a
foreign
insurer
that
involves
a
risk--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
it
applies
to
an
insurer
that
has
no
u.s.
office.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
tax
applies
not
simply
to
export
insurance
but
across
the
board
to
all
types
of
casualty
insurance,
but
again,
to
get
back
to
the
problem
that
you're
postulating
here,
the
approach
is
to
look
at
the
tax
and
determine
whether
or
not
it
discriminates
against
exports.
if
it
does
not
discriminate
against
exports,
then
the
tax
is
valid.
i
would
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
a
party
could
say
that,
even
though
the
tax
on
its
face
is
nondiscriminatory
and
therefore
valid,
that
in
fact
it
has
a
pretext
or
a
different
motive
that
requires
a
further
analysis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
that's
a
very
small
number
of
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that
there
is.
the
total
amount
of
tax
revenue
that
is
collected
each
year
from
section
4371
is
about
$100
million,
and
we
don't
know
what
proportion
of
that
tax
relates
to
export
insurance
and
which
portion
relates
to
flood
insurance,
fire
insurance,
or
any
other
type
of
casualty
insurance
that
might
be
imposed
under
this
tax.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
does
cover
reinsurance
at
a
different
rate.
it
does
provide
for
a
1-cent
rather
a
4-cent--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
might
explain
it,
that's
true.
we
simply
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
oh,
i
believe
that
the
tax
here
is
designed
to
eliminate
the
competitive
advantage
that
foreign
insurers
enjoy
in
this
market
by
their
exemption
from
the
federal
income
tax,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
that
type
of
tax
is
permissible.
it's
very
similar
to
a
tariff
tax
for,
as
i
say,
a
service
that's
being
provided
in
this
country.
i
think
overall
it's...
viewed
from
the
framers'
perspective
the
thames
decision
would
be
viewed
as
an
anomaly,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
appropriate,
first
of
all
because
it
has
a
more
general
meaning,
second,
because
even
justice--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--story
recognizes--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
and
justice--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
you've
already
given
it
a
broader
meaning
than
that
in
justice
marshall's,
chief
justice
marshall's
first
opinion,
where
he
felt
that
impost
reached
a
licensing
fee,
which
would
never
have
been
viewed
as
an
impost
in
the
normal,
limited
meaning
of
that
term.
i
think
these
terms
have
really
become,
in
a
sense,
terms
of
art
that
are
tied
to
the
objectives
that
the
framers
sought
to
convey
through
the
constitution.
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
court
has
used
the
term
tax
and
impost
interchangeably.
in
a
1906
decision
called
new
jersey
v.
anderson,
this
court
described
a
tax
as
an
impost
for
the
support
of
the
government.
that
appears
at
203
u.s.
at
492.
so
i
don't
think
that
a
word
search
will
really
provide
us
the
answer
here.
instead,
i
think
we
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
broader
perspective
and
make
sure
that
the
export-clause
jurisprudence
is
consistent
with
the
import-export-clause
jurisprudence.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
because
that
is
the
one
source
of
consistency
in
this
area
of
law
in
the
past
170
years,
and
even
in
washington
stevedores,
this
court
cited
export
clause
cases...
the
spalding
case
in
particular,
as
a
case
that
it
viewed
as
taking
the
wrong
approach
in
this
area
of
law.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
first,
that
what
respondent
is
arguing
for
here
is
something
that
is
truly
peculiar.
in
this
one
area
under
the
constitution
the
states
would
have
broader
authority
than
the
federal
government
on
a
matter
respecting
foreign
commerce.
that
is
the
result
of
their
interpretation,
their
differing
interpretations
of
the
export
clause
and
the
import-export
clause.
i
think
that
strikes
one
as
surprising.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
actual
cases...
now,
fairbanks
was
the
only...
the
first
case
in
which
this
court
struck
down
a
federal
tax
on
an
export
clause
theory,
and
that
was
a
discriminatory
tax,
and
that
tax
would
have
been
viewed
as
violative
of
the
import-export
clause
as
well
at
that
time.
what
we're
arguing
is
the
same
prohibition
basically
applies
with
respect
to
exports
whether
the
taxes
are
federal
or
state
taxes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
tax
there,
i
think
that
under
the
import-export
clause,
until
this
court's
reasoning,
new
reasoning
in
michelin
tires
and
washington
stevedores,
a
state
tax
on
insurance
related
to
exports
would
have
also
been
struck
down.
so
in
other
words,
the
tax...
the
extent
of
the
prohibition
would
have
been
the
same
under
either
clause.
now
that
the
prohibition
has...
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
import-export
clause
involves
a
narrower
prohibition,
it's
time
to
reconsider
whether
the
export
clause
ought
to
be
read
as
a
broader
prohibition
itself.
respondent--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
was
on--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
they
are,
though,
if
you
look
at
the
cases
in
combination.
to
be
sure,
the
goods
in
michelin
involve
goods
not
in
transit,
but
the
tax
in
washington
stevedores
did,
and
the
tax
in
michelin--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
i
believe
it's...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
would
say
i
think
it's
problematic
to
describe
a
tax
on
insurance
as
a
tax
on
the
good.
i
think
that's
a
problem,
as
i
said,
in
thames
&
mersey--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
don't
believe
you're
foreclosed
from...
by
our
concession
from
addressing
that
issue
as
you
see
fit.
but
i
think
that
there's
another
problem
i'd
like
to
turn
to,
too,
and
that
is
this
whole
notion
of
trying
to
determine
when
a
tax
is
laid
upon
the
export
process.
this
has
been
a
problem
that
bedeviled
the
court
for
many
years
under
the
import-export
clause,
and
you
look
at
the
line
of
cases
that
came
through
here,
and
there
is
no
consistency
here.
spalding
said
that
the
tax
applied
when
the
product
was
handed
to
a
common
carrier,
but
joy
petroleum
said
that
if
a
product
stops
along
the
way
and
is
put
in
storage,
then
it
is
subject
to
a
local
tax.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
there
have
been
very
few
cases
since
spalding
simply
because
the
effect
of
the
export
clause
is
so
draconian,
and
it
is
this
case
that
we
have
chosen
to
ask
the
court
to
review
its
thinking
in
this
area,
and
to
bring
it
in
line
with
the
import-export
clause.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
that's
not
an
unusual
problem,
that
the
taxpayer
will
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
a
tax
that
appears
to
be
fair
on
its
face
is
discriminatory
in
a
particular
context,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
right,
but
the
same
thing
was
true
with
regard
to
the
import-export
clause.
for
instance,
there
is
still
the
question
of
what
happens
if
a
state
imposes
a
property
tax
on
property
that
is
in
transit
through
the
state
without
stopping,
on
the
property
that's
being
transported
on
the
rail
cars
as
it
moves
through
the
state?
can
they
tax
that?
that
question
is
still
one
of
the
questions
that
has
been
left
open
in
michelin
tire,
and
likewise
there
will
be
some
issues
that
will
be
left
open
here.
thank
you,
your
honor.
