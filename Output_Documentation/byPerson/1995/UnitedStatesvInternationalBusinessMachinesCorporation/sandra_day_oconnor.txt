well,
mr.
minear,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
export
clause,
not
the
import-export
clause,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
certainly
is
possible
that
the
export
clause
has
different
purposes
than
the
import-export
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
do
concede
that
if
we
do
not
overrule
the
thames
case
that
you
lose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
obviously
would
require
ultimately
overruling
more
than
just
thames
&
mersey.
there
are
some
other
cases
that
are
of
the
same
genre,
are
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
should
we
do
that
at
all?
why
not
leave
them
in
place?
what
harm
does
it
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
occasionally
one
has
that.
we
certainly
have
the
precedents
out
there,
and
i
just...
you're
going
to
have
to
persuade
me
that
there
are
some
very
important
reasons
for
overturning
these
longstanding
precedents.
and
this
is
a
separate
provisions,
too.
it's
not
as
if
it's
based
on
the
commerce
clause.
it's
based
on
a
separate
prohibition
against
taxes
on
imports,
on
exports,
which
is...
the
language
is
different
even
in
the
export-import
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
the
tax
covers
reinsurance
so
that
things
like
insurance
carried
by
lloyd's
would
be
covered
by
this
tax--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
could
explain
the
large
revenues.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this.
i
thought
that
under
cases
like
this
stevedoring
case
we
wouldn't
say
that
a
tax
is
nondiscriminatory
unless
it
bears
a
reasonable
relationship
with
the
privilege
of
doing
business
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
i'm
not
certain
that
a
tax
imposed
on
insurance
on
goods
traveling
overseas
bears
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
united
states
under
that
test.
