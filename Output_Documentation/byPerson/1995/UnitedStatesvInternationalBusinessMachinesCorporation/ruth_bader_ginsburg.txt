mr.
minear,
you
mentioned
washington
stevedoring,
which
involved
the
cost
of
loading,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i
thought
that
the
whole
idea
of
that
is
that
that
was
a
discrete
item,
that
you
could
separate
the
stevedoring,
the
loading
of
the
vessel
from
the
goods,
and
i
was
struck
by
your
brief
that
you
don't
make
any
lesser
argument.
you
don't
say,
this
tax
is
okay
because
it's
on
the
insurance
and
not
on
the
goods.
you
seem
to
concede
that
the
tax
should
be
treated
as
though
it
were
on
the
goods.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear--
--no,
but
that's--
--would
you
explain
to
me
why
you
don't
make
the
argument,
the
simple
argument
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
evening
out
the
situation
for
domestic
insurers,
because
this
would
apply
to
the...
suppose
there
were
a
foreign
company
that
was
insuring
entirely
domestic
transport,
the
tax
would
apply,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
that
seems
such
a
simple
argument
that
you
avoid,
and
i'm
not
clear
on
why
you're
doing
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
do
we
have
any--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
we
have
any
idea
whether
there
is
any
business
of
insuring
domestic
transport
by
foreign
insurance
companies
that
have
no
office
in
the
u.s.?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
atwood,
the
concern
of
congress
was
with
domestic
insurers,
and
i
take
it
from
your
argument
that
there
couldn't
be
this
tax
as
to
exports,
but
to
the
extent
that
they
are
insuring
or
reinsuring
risks
in
the
united
states,
the
premiums
could
be
taxed.
that's
certainly
inconsistent
with
what
congress
was
trying
to
regulate
in
the
interest
of
domestic
insurers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
response
has
got
to
be
that
congress
can't...
it's
just
too
bad
for
these
domestic
insurers.
they'll
fall
by
the
wayside
and
business
will
go
to
the
foreign
companies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
is
it
inevitable
that
this
must
be
classed
as
a
tax
on
the
goods
rather
than
a
tax
on
the
service
of
providing
insurance?
