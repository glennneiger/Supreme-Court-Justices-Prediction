ms.

beale
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
two
important
questions
about
the
procedural
rights
afforded
to
defendants
who
tender
guilty
pleas,
including
criminal
forfeiture.
the
two
questions
are:
first,
whether
rule
11(f)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
requires
the
district
court
to
find
a
factual
basis
for
the
defendant's
guilty
plea
to
the
criminal
forfeiture,
and
second,
whether
a
defendant
who
waives...
excuse
me,
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
waives
his
right
to
a
jury
verdict
on
forfeiture
if
he
was
not
advised
of
that
right
and
never
expressly
waived
it.
briefly,
the
facts
are
as
follows:
in
exchange
for
the
prosecutor's
agreement
to
recommend
a
20-year
sentence
on
one
count,
and
to
drop
the
remaining
counts,
petitioner
pled
guilty
to
violating
21
u.s.c.
section
848,
and
he
signed
an
agreement
containing
three
paragraphs
regarding
criminal
forfeiture.
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
paragraph
10
of
that
agreement
forfeited
all
of
petitioner's
property,
including
legitimately
acquired
property.
the
district
court
accepted
petitioner's
plea
without
making
a
finding
that
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
this
forfeiture.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
included
all
of
petitioner's
property
of
every
kind--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--oh,
i
think
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
everyone
in
the
case
concedes
that
the
property,
some
of
the
property
involved
was
acquired
legitimately.
there
were
findings
to
that
effect
in
the
district
court.
for
example,
some
of
the--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--no.
i
think
that
there's
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
here.
in
the
first
instance,
how
was
the
property
acquired,
and
that
there
was
some
which
was
legitimately
acquired
as
opposed
to
property,
let's
say,
that
would
be
the
proceeds
of
a
criminal
offense.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
all
right,
and
so--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--i
mean
legitimately
acquired.
for
example,
before
it's
alleged
that
the
conduct
in
question
occurred.
so
he
had
property
that
was
acquired
by
him
as
a
child
which
was
involved
in
forfeiture
here,
for
example.
i
think
everyone
concedes
that
that
property
was
legitimately
acquired.
the
two
bank
accounts,
for
example,
from
the
chicago
area
which
were
opened
first
when
he
was
in
grade
school
and
never
had
any
deposits
after
at
least
1981
in
the
case
of
both
accounts.
also,
his
salary
from
general
chemical
in
green
river,
wyoming.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
it's
accepted
by
all
parties.
i'm
not
sure
if
there's
a
sentence
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
but
it--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--that's
correct.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
correct,
and...
i
mean,
that
would
be
another
proper
reading.
i
think--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well,
i
believe
that
gets
to
the
nub
of
the
point.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
it's
not
a
question--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--i
think
the
point
is
that
property...
property
gets--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--i
don't
think
you'll
find
that
sentence
as
such.
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--that
is
correct.
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
quite
clear
that
their
point
is
that
petitioner
entered
into
an
agreement
that
would
forfeit
all
property
without
any
determination
whether
it
was
or
was
not,
for
example,
proceeds,
and...
period.
and
i
think
everyone
concedes
that
some
of
the
property
here
was
not
acquired
as
proceeds.
i
believe
the
government's
position
is
it
could
become
forfeitable,
not
that
it
was
not
legitimately
acquired,
but
it
could
become
forfeitable,
let's
say,
as
a
substitute
asset.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
right,
so
there
was
no
finding,
for
example,
that
that
property
in
the
district
court
level
or
at
the
court
of
appeals
level,
that
it
was
forfeitable
because
it
was
proc...
because
it
was
not
legitimately
acquired,
and
so
the
point
merely
is
that
it
would
take
some
factual...
set
of
factual
assumptions
to
show
that
legitimately
acquired
property
is,
in
fact,
subject
to
forfeiture.
it
could
become
subject
to
forfeiture,
depending
upon
the
facts
that
were
shown,
and
the
district
court
never
made
those
factual
findings
in
the
first
instance,
so
if
i
can
clarify
that.
the
district
court
also
accepted
petitioner's
plea
without
advising
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
special
jury
verdict
on
the
question
of
what
property,
if
any,
was
subject
to
forfeiture,
although
he
had
a
right,
and
it
would
have
been
possible
for
him
to
plead
guilty,
and
nonetheless
contest
on
the
section
848
charge,
and
nonetheless
contest
forfeiture
before
the
jury.
he
was
not
advised
of
that
right,
and
he
never
expressly
waived
it.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
there
are
really
two
requirements
that
we're
talking
about,
and
it's
important
for
me
to
distinguish
those.
one
of
the
issues
before
the
court
is
the
question
of
the
waiver
standard
that's
applicable
to
the
jury
trial
right,
and
on
that
point,
for
example,
if
the
judge
had
clearly
indicated
to
mr.
libretti
not
simply
that
the
jury
won't
find
you
guilty
or
innocent,
which
is
what
he
told
mr.
libretti,
but
had
said,
the
jury
won't
find
you
guilty
or
innocent,
and
you
have
a
right
to
have
that
determination,
and
the
jury
won't
make
any
determination
of
what
assets
are
forfeitable,
and
you
have
a
right
to
that
determination
as
well,
now,
do
you
want
to
plead
guilty,
that
would
have
taken
care
of
the
waiver
of
the
jury
trial
right.
there's
an
independent
requirement,
however,
under
rule
11(f)
for
a
factual
basis,
and
i
think
that's
clear
if
you
imagine
a
case...
laying
forfeiture
to
one
side,
if
you
imagine
a
case
as
a
bank
robbery
case.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
in
that
instance
there
would
be
both
a
requirement
that
the
defendant
waive
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
and
also
a
requirement
that
a
factual
basis
be
shown
for
his
plea
to
the
bank
robbery
offense.
so
it's
true--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--that's
correct,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it's
exactly
parallel
to
the
requirements
for
a
plea
of
guilty
on
the
offenses
that
are
charged.
the
purpose
of
the
factual
basis
requirement
really
is
to
ensure
that
there's
a
match
between
the
evidence
in
the
case
on
the
one
hand
and
the
legal
requirements
of
the
charge
on
the
other
hand,
and
if
there
are
five
or
six
counts
in
the
indictment,
there's
got
to
be--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
situation
is--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--i
think
the
situation
is
just
parallel
to
that,
where...
that
the
government
doesn't
have
its
proof
in
order
yet
on
some
of
the...
have
proof
in
order
on
some
counts,
for
example,
in
the
indictment,
and
not
others.
if
it
couldn't
make
at
least
a
factual
basis
showing
on
those
other
counts,
then
it
wouldn't
be
able
to
resolve
that
part
of
that
case,
that's
correct.
now,
the
standard
is
not--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--that's
correct
to
the
extent
that
it's
a
dependent
part
of
that
plea.
now,
there
might
be
other
charges
that
could
be
entirely
resolved.
in
our
view,
the
requirements
of
federal
law
do
make
the
forfeiture
charge
a
substantive
charge.
as
the
court
is
aware,
federal
rules
require
it
to
be
charged
in
the
indictment,
proved
to
the
jury
with
a
special
jury
verdict,
and
embodied
in
the
judgment.
those
are
very
substantial
requirements
that
effectively
make
forfeiture
a
unique
hybrid.
it
is
a
substantive
charge
in
the
indictment,
and
the
plea
by
definition
has
to
resolve
the
charges
in
the
indictment.
you
plead
to
those
charges
in
the
indictment,
and
federal
law
makes
that
a
substantive
charge.
now,
it's
not
an
element
of
the
offense
of
a
violation,
let's
say,
of
section
848,
the
crime
that
the
defendant
was
accused
of
here,
but
it
does,
under
federal
law,
have
this
unique
character
of
a
substantive
charge
in
the
indictment
which
must
be
responded
to.
there
are
only
two
ways
to
resolve
the
charge.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
in
this
case.
your
honor,
as
opposed
to
in
general
would
it
ever
be
possible--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--all
right.
in
general,
i
believe
that
it
might
be
possible
to
resolve
the
underlying...
the
question
of
the
underlying
guilt
and
take
the
plea
to
that,
and
leave
unresolved
for
the
moment
the
forfeiture
charge
and
the...
whether
that
would
be
ultimately
resolved
by
a
jury
determination
of
that,
or
whether
that
might
also
be
resolved
by
a
plea
on
the
forfeiture
with
a
factual
basis
and
with
the
necessary
waiver.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
correct,
in
the
same
way.
typically...
now,
that
was
not
done
in
this
case,
but
typically
the
way
these
indictments
are
drawn
up
is
to
include
the
forfeiture
charge
in
a
separate
count.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
and
you
would
literally
plead
to
count
2
and
not
3,
4,
5,
and
so
forth,
and
i
think
that
would
be
certainly
possible
that
the
parties
would
agree
to
resolve
it
that
way
and
the
court
would
be
willing
to
accept
the
guilty
plea
under
those
circumstances.
now--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--exactly.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
exactly.
now,
in
this
case,
it
appears
that
the
parties
had
a
kind
of
interwoven
or
interrelated
agreement.
as
i
said,
in
return
for
the
prosecutor's
agreement
to
recommend
a
20-year
sentence
and
not
to
proceed
with
the
other
counts,
then
petitioner
agreed
to
plead
guilty,
and
i
think
that
where
the
resolution
of
the
counts
is
interrelated
as
a
matter
of
plea-bargain
and
the
parties'
understanding,
then
the
court
may
indeed
need
to
accept
or
reject,
resolve
all
at
one
time,
otherwise
the
parties
may
not
in
fact
be
tendering
that
agreement
to
the
court.
now...
well--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--it
depends,
so
that
if
the
factual
basis
showing
was
that
in
fact,
let's
say,
substitute
assets
would
reach
even
with
legitimately
acquired
property--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--we
think
it's
clear
that
the
court
cannot
accept
a
plea
on
that
basis
and
enter
a
sentence
any
more
than
it
could
accept
petitioner's
agreement
to
serve
a
30-year
sentence
if
the
statutory
maximum
were
20
years,
even
if
he
was
willing
to
agree
to
that,
even
if
he
might,
for
example,
be
willing
to
agree
to
that
to
avoid
the
prosecution
of
his
wife,
or
his
child,
or
to
preserve
a
uniquely
valuable
asset.
there
are
policy-based
outer
limitations
on
the
court's
sentencing
authority,
and
those
clearly
have
to
be
observed
or
the
sentence
itself
is
illegal,
and
we
think--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--i
think
that
the
characterization
of
the
criminal
forfeiture
itself
is
exactly
the
pivotal
point.
what
i
would
not--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--we
concede
that
forfeiture
operates
as
a
penalty,
so
in
that
sense,
sentencing
enhancement
would
be
one
way
of
describing
that
penalty,
that
there's
a
period
of
imprisonment
plus
this
enhanced
penalty
of
forfeiture.
what
we
don't
accept
is
the
notion
that
there
are
only
two
possibilities.
there
are
the
elements
of
the
offense
on
the
one
hand,
and
mere
matters
of
sentencing
on
the
other
hand.
we
think
what
congress
did
was,
in
reviving
criminal
forfeiture
and
then
the
rules
promulgated
first
by
the
advisory
committee,
then
adopted
by
this
court
and
congress,
what
they
did
was
create
something,
quite
properly,
that
is
a
unique
hybrid,
that
is
not,
strictly
speaking,
an
element
of
any
particular
offense
but
is
plainly
not
treated
like
any
other
matter
of
sentencing,
so
it
operates
as
a
penalty,
but
it
has
far
different
procedural
characteristics
associated
with
it
that
reflect
a
different...
a
quite
different
weighting
of
the
interests
that
are
involved
there.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
think
that
the
characterization
is
just
a
shorthand
way
of
summing
up
those
attributes,
so
i'm
not
so
sure
that
it
matters
what--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--we
could
certainly
argue
that.
i
think
that
we
are
hampered--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
we
felt
somewhat--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--we
mean
to
be
making
that
argument
your
honor,
and
if
we
haven't
made
it
clearly,
let
me
endorse
that
now.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
was
using
the
characterization
only
as
a
way
to
draw
attention
to
those
features,
so
that's
right.
we
don't
require
a
head-in.
we
only
need
to
draw
attention
to
those
crucial
characteristics.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
the
link-up,
the
factual
basis
can
come
from
either
the
defendant
or
the
government.
oftentimes,
a
district
court
will
inquire
of
the
defendant,
do
you
admit
the
various
facts
that
would
then
add
up
to
be
the
elements
of
the
offense
or
the--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--right.
that's
correct.
rule
11(f)
itself
doesn't
identify
the
government
as
the
party
who
has
the
burden
of
identifying
the
factual
basis.
what
it
says
to
the
judge
is
that
you
must
be
satisfied
that
there
is
a
factual
basis,
and
i
think
that
reflects
the
constitutional
imperative
of
the
inquiry
to
determine
that
the
plea
is
in
fact
knowing,
intelligent,
and
voluntary,
that
there's
a
match-up,
so
it
can
come
from
either
side,
either
the
defense
side
or
the
government.
if
we
have
a
sufficient
factual
basis,
then
that
portion
of
the
case
is
taken
care
of.
now,
where
we
got
into
difficulties
in
front
of
the
district
court
i
think
was
that
the
judge
indicated
he
was
not
satisfied
with
what
the
government
had
come
forward
on
the
one
hand,
that
even
though
they
argued
substitute
assets
he
said,
i
don't
think
you've
proven
that
yet.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
there
are
two
points
in
time.
initially,
when
the
government
simply
assumed
that
the
plea
itself
was
enough,
that
was
when
the
plea
was
entered,
and
the
second
point
in
time
where
the
district
judge
said
to
the
defendant,
you
show
me...
i'm
ready
to
hear
your
evidence,
show
me
what
pieces
of
property
you
think
are
not
forfeitable.
that
was
3
months
later,
in
the
ancillary
third
party
hearing,
after
the
notice
of
appeal
had
been
filed,
and
the
judge
realized
the
scope
of
the
forfeiture
rule.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
and
rule
11
does
not
put
the
burden
specifically
on
the
government.
it
simply
says
the
court
must
find
a
factual
basis.
now,
note
that
that's
in
the
context
where
the
defendant
and
the
government
come
forward
together,
and
where
the
defendant
himself
is
tendering
a
guilty
plea,
so
it's
really
quite
different
from
the
context
of--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--the
district
judge
needs
to...
without
regard
to
which
party
it
comes
from,
he
needs
to
identify
a
proffer
of
facts
that
would
link
up
specific
pieces
of
property
or
categories
of
property
with
a
factual
reason
why
those
pieces
of
property
are
forfeited
under
federal
law.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
correct,
and
we
believe
the
defendant--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--that's
correct,
and--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--that's
right,
and
we
believe--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--that's
correct,
and
we
believe
that
the
plea
of
guilty...
that
there
are
two
pleas
of
guilty,
in
essence,
if
you
charge
it
in,
as
they
ordinarily
do,
in
a
separate
count
of
the
indictment
to
resolve
the
charge
of
forfeiture.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
right.
you
plead
innocent
or
guilty--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
way
the
rules
are
set
up.
the
rules
are
set
up
that
this
is
something
that
the
government
must
literally
charge
in
the
indictment,
charge
against
the
defendant
in
the
indictment,
and
either
prove
to
the
jury
as
a
charge...
and
the
senate
report
i
think
describes
this
in
a
way
that
we
have
found
helpful.
it's
an
in
personam--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that's
not
the
logical
consequence
of
the
combined
change
wrought
by
the
statutory
revival
of
forfeiture
and
the
implementation
of
that
forfeiture
requirement
in
the
federal
rules.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
treating
it
as
a
charge,
and
indeed,
incorporating
it...
notice
there
has
to
be
a
judgment.
it
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
sentencing.
you
have
to
resolve
that
charge
either
by
proof
to
the
jury
or,
alternatively,
by
a
plea.
there's
no
other
way
to
resolve
such
a
charge,
and
although
the
language
takes
some
getting
used
to...
i
think
there's
some
initial
reluctance
to
see
that
as
what
we
would
describe
as
a
guilty
plea...
we
believe
that's
the
logical
consequence
of
the
way
the
rules
are
set
out.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
we
were
not
in
a
position
to...
given
the
grant
of
cert
to
argue--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--i
believe
the
court
should
hold
that
a
factual
basis
is
required
under
11(f).
that's
the
easiest
way,
i
think,
to
resolve
this.
it
doesn't--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well,
i
think
that
one
could
conclude
that
in
parallel
with
the
general
requirements
of
sentencing,
and
in
parallel
with
the
requirement
of
11(f)
as
to
the
substantive
offense,
that
the
appropriate
disposition
of
a
plea
would
require
the
showing
of
a
factual
basis,
whether
it
falls--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well,
i
believe
justice
breyer
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
whole
scheme
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
the
statutes
that
underlie
that,
require
a
factual
basis
for
the
determination--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--no.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
remedy
sought...
that
it's
not
so
clear
as
you
imagine,
that
in
this
case
the
result
will
be
that
there's
a
trial.
i
believe
the
proper
remedy
is
to
remand
to
the
district
court,
and
to
go
back
to
status
quo
ante,
and
in
fact
there
may
be
a
showing
of
a
factual
basis.
it
may
depend
a
bit
on
the
breadth
of
the
government's
claim
of
forfeiture.
in
fact,
the
indictment
is
narrower,
the
charge
in
the
indictment
is
narrower
than
the
courts...
as
construed,
paragraph
10
of
the
agreement.
if
the
court
finds
that
there's
a
textual
basis--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--well,
we
did
discuss
both
the
in
general
and
the
in
this
case.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
and
in
this
case,
if
we
find
a
factual
basis
on
remand,
then
presumably
there
is
no
difficulty.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
then
in
this
case
i
do
believe
it's
interwoven,
and
at
that
point
the
parties
have
some
choice.
the
government
may
restrict
the
forfeiture
that
it
requests
in
order
that
the
entire
agreement
may
stand
on
a
proper
footing.
if,
for
example,
the
government
determines
that
it
has
sought
to
forfeit
property
that
it
didn't
perhaps
even
realize--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--was
not
subject
to
forfeiture,
it
may
restrict
the
nature
of
its
claim.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
when
i
said
status
quo
ante,
i
meant--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--i
believe
you
go
back
in
the
first
instance...
in
the
first
instance
to
the
very
moment
of
the
rule
11
colloquy
itself,
and
so
you
determine
whether
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
if
they
find
no
rule...
no
factual
basis,
then
petitioner
is
perfectly
prepared
to
accept
the
possibility--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--the
plea
falls
apart.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
agreement
that
the
government
and
the
petitioner
will--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--he
should
ordinarily
reject
the
plea,
if
there's
no
factual
basis--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--in
this
case,
where
it's
a
single
interrelated
plea,
that's
correct.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
now,
it's
possible,
again,
that
the
parties
would
resubmit
a
more
narrowly
tailored
agreement
that
would
reflect
on
a
factual
basis.
