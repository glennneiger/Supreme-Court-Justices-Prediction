justice
david
h.
souter
does
their
reading...
is
there
an
indication
that
their
reading
was
that
the
legitimately
acquired
property
was
also
nonforfeitable?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
make
that
claim,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--has
anyone
made
that
express
assumption?
i
take
it
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
state
that
assumption.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
state
that
assumption,
did
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
the
district
court
was
in
fact
holding
hearings
that
would
have
been
relevant
to
that
determination,
but
they
were
the
hearings
without
jurisdiction,
so
we
can't
depend
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
mm-hmm.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me--
--then--
--go
on.
no,
you.
i'm
sorry.
that's
all
right.
maybe
i
misunderstood
you
before.
if
that
is
so,
why
does
it
matter...
why
is
it
crucial
to
characterize
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
it's
a
shorthand
way,
in
effect,
of
obfuscating
this
hybrid
character.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
make
this
suggestion
to
you.
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
there
is
in
fact
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
determination
with
respect
to
the
forfeiture.
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
or
not,
but
i
mean,
there's
an
argument
for
it.
and
let's
assume
also,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
the
boykin
requirements
are
in
fact
constitutionally
mandated
and
not
merely
our
choices
of
the
best
way
to
get
from
here
to
there.
if
you
make
those
two
assumptions,
then
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
the
statement
of
factual
basis
was
constitutionally
mandated,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you'd
argue
that,
and
you'd
say
well
that
argument
is
sound
or
not
regardless
of
whether
you
characterize
this
as
element,
or
whether
you
characterize
this
as
penalty
enhancement.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
make
some
such
argument
here?
why
don't
you
say,
for
example,
in
order
to
avoid
having
to
grapple
with
these
constitutional
issues
about
the
sixth
amendment
requirement
of
jury
verdict
on
forfeiture
and
the
exactly
mandatory
character
of
boykin,
the
way
to
avoid
those
issues
is
to
read
rule
11(f)
to
require
the
statement
of
factual
basis,
and
why
don't
you
make
that
argument,
which
would
not
require
a
characterization
one
way
or
the
other?
we
could
leave
that
issue
in
limbo.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you're
making
that
argument,
you
don't
have
to
make
the
characterization
on
an
either-or
basis,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
you're
going
beyond
that.
i
thought
you
said
that
there
would...
well,
maybe
you
didn't
say
there
would
be
a
sufficient
basis.
you
said
it
would
be
a
relevant
factual
basis
that
this
agreement
had
been
made.
if
that
argument
was
sound,
then
that
would
be
a
relevant
factual
basis
that
an
agreement
to
plead
guilty
had
been
made,
yet
that's
not
sufficient
under
the
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
correct
that
that's
what
you
said,
or
it's
correct
that
that
would
not
be
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
were
suggesting
that
there
was
an
independent
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
judge.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
what
about
the
claim
of
the
right
to
forfeiture.
can
a
stipulation
that
he
will
but
he
agrees
to
forfeit
be
a
sufficient
factual
basis?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
why
the
difference?
why
is
it
enough
on
forfeiture,
but
it's
not
enough
on
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
the
fact
that
the
rule
applies
on
guilt
or
innocence
and
the
rule
doesn't
apply
on
forfeiture?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
have
said...
i
apologize
in
a
way
for
keeping
cutting
you
off
like
this.
i
promise
you
i'll
let
you
run
as
long
as
you
want
in
a
second,
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
even
without
the
rule,
the
judge
has
an
obligation
to
assure
himself
that
there
is
some
factual
basis
to
believe
that
the
forfeiture
was
not
a
wholly
illegal
forfeiture.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
source
of
that
obligation?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
get
you
to
the
equivalent
of
rule
11,
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
here,
if
we
make
the
assumption
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
particular
right,
the
jury
determination
with
respect
to
forfeiture,
is
of
constitutional
dimension,
then
it
would
be
very
odd
to
say
that
the
same
guilty
plea
which
waives
the
right
to
a
trial
on
guilt
and
innocence
should
be
treated
differently
from
the
guilty
plea
insofar
as
it
waives
the
jury
determination
with
respect
to
the
forfeiture.
i
mean,
why
would
you
draw
that
distinction?
there's
no
pragmatic
reason
to
do
so.
it's
not
that
you
would
be
interfering
with
the
relationship
between
counsel
and
client,
or
what-not.
why
would
you
ever
draw
that
distinction
if
you
assume
that
in
fact
it
is
of
constitutional...
that
the
determination
on
forfeiture
is
of
constitutional
significance?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
just
why...
just...
my
question
is,
why
would
you
want
to
draw
that
distinction?
what
would
make
that
a
rational
and
sensible
distinction
to
draw?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
does
sound
as
though
you're
rejecting
my
premise.
[laughter]
and
if
you
don't
reject
my
premise,
what's
your
answer?
why
would
you
draw
that
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
was
told
that,
and
yet
in
the
colloquy
which
is
in...
which
has
been
already
adverted
to,
the
judge
as
part
of
that
colloquy
then
went
on
to
say,
now,
if
you
plead
guilty,
that's
going
to
be
the
end
of
it
and
so
on,
and
he
says,
the
jury
is
not
going
to
decide
whether
you're
guilty
or
not.
that
suggests
to
me,
would
suggest
to
me
if
i
were
the
defendant
standing
there,
that
my
jury
trial
right
goes
to
guilt
or
innocence.
it
would
not
suggest
to
me
that
i
had
a
jury
trial
right
with
respect
to
the
forfeiture,
and
even
if
i
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the...
that
a
mere
statement
or
an
unqualified
statement
saying
you
waive
your
right
to
jury
trial,
of
all
matters
charged
against
you,
or
what-not,
would
be
sufficient,
it
seems
to
me,
going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
what
happened
here
is
the
judge
seems
to
have
modified
that
later
in
the
colloquy
to
indicate
that
the
jury
trial
right
just
goes
to
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
you
were
standing
there
listening,
wouldn't
you
draw
the
conclusion
that
you
had
a
jury
trial
right
on
guilt
and
innocence,
and
likewise
conclude
that
you
didn't
have
a
jury
trial
right
on
anything
else?
