justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
included
legitimately
acquired
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
it
didn't
say
that
it
included
legitimately
acquired
property.
it
simply
amounted
to,
in
the
court
of
appeal's
view,
an
acknowledgement
that
none
of
his
property
was
legitimately
acquired.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
which
you
mean
not
properly
forfeitable?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
legitimately
acquired
with
the
proceeds.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
this,
said
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
what
you
said.
you
said
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
he
agreed
to
a...
that
by
reason
of
his
agreement,
he
forfeited
properly,
legitimately
acquired
property,
is
what
you
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that?
wouldn't
it
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
they
said
he
forfeited
everything
he
owned
on
the
assumption
some
of
it
might
have
been
legitimately
acquired?
even
if
some
was
legitimately
acquired,
under
their
reading
he
would
have
forfeited
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
beale,
do
you
get
that
from
rule
11(f)?
i
mean,
if
you're
making
a
constitutional
argument,
i
suppose
we
can
discuss
boykin,
but
how
do
you
find
that
in
rule
11(f),
which
speaks
of
notwithstanding
the
acceptance
of
a
plea
of
guilty,
a
guilty
plea,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
an
agreement
to
forfeiture,
but
a
plea
of
guilty
of
the
offense,
presumably.
the
court
should
not
enter
a
judgment
upon
such
plea,
that
is,
the
plea
of
guilty,
without
making
such
inquiry
as
shall
satisfy
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
justice
antonin
scalia
presumably,
the
plea
of
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
court
did
that
here,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
guilty
of
forfeiture?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
guilty
of
forfeiture,
you're
punished
with
forfeiture
for
being
guilty
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
condition
of
imposing
that
penalty
the
government
must
do
that,
but
that
does
not
make
that
a
plea
of
guilty.
i
mean,
what
a
plea
of
guilty
means,
it
means,
i
did
the
crime,
not,
i'm
subject
to
forfeiture.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
so
you're
saying
he
does
not
have
to
satisfy
himself
personally
of
the
factual
basis.
it
is
enough
if
he
receives
from
the
defendant
a
concession
that
a
factual
basis
exists.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
no
concession
that
a
factual
basis
exists
is
there,
then
he
may
have
to
conduct
some
other
inquiry.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that
would
be
enough
under
the
rule,
but
i
thought
you're
saying
the
rule
doesn't
apply
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
in
this
plea
agreement
did
the
defendant
acknowledge
the
factual
basis
for
his
giving
up
his
title
to
all
his
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
case
would
be
a
lot
stronger
if
you
said
the
defendant
agrees
that
all
of
these
assets
are
properly
forfeitable
at
law,
and
he
agrees
to
transfer
them
all
to
the
government.
all
it
says,
however,
is
he
agrees
to
transfer
them
to
the
government.
now,
how
do
you
find
what
you
say
is
the
necessary
factual
concession
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
what
page?
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
what
if
the
plea
agreement
says
nothing
at
all--
--yes.
--about
whether
it
is
properly
forfeitable
or
improperly,
it
just
says,
he
agrees
to
forfeit
all
his
assets?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about--
--what
about
his
obligation?
--i'm
talking
about
what
he
has
to
do.
wouldn't
he
do
exactly
what
the
judge
is
trying
to
do
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
that.
answer
my
question,
would
you.
what
does
the
judge
have
to
do
when
he
gets
a
plea
agreement
that
says
nothing
more
than
he
agrees
to
forfeit
all
his
assets,
period,
and
there's
no
colloquy
with
counsel
which
you
contend
suggests
that
there's
an
acknowledgement
that
they
are
all
forfeitable?
there's
no
acknowledgement
at
all
that
they
are
forfeitable,
just
he
agrees
to
forfeit
all
of
them.
is
that
an
adequate
plea
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
would
not
have
to
make
any
further
inquiry?
