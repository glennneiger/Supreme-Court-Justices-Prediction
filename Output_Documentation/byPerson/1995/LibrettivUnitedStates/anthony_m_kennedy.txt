justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
not
all
of
the
property
had
yet
been
identified.
we
know
that
a
substantial
forfeiture
is
going
to
occur,
but
we
don't
know
quite
where
the
bank
accounts
are,
what
the
amount
is,
where
the
location
of
the
real
property
is,
then
how
would
you
proceed?
could
you
not
take
the
plea
agreement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pardon
me,
not
take
the
plea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
your
view
the
court
couldn't
even
take
the
plea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
case
depend...
does
your
argument
depend
on
whether
we
characterize
this
as
sentencing
enhancement
or
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
a
pivotal
point
in
the
analysis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it's
enhancement
of
the
offense,
then
what
happens
to
your
case,
if
it's
an
enhancement
of
punishment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that's
not
a
reasonable
way
to
construe
the
agreement,
but
that
after
the
plea
is
accepted,
he
then
holds
a
complete
forfeiture
hearing,
is
the
plea
still
invalid?
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
conceding
more
than
you
should.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
that
he
has
to
make
either
a
finding
that
there's
a
factual
basis,
or
at
least
construe
a
concession
or
an
agreement
that
way,
for
the
plea
to
be
valid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
plea
stands,
and
then
the
question
is
just
the
adequacy
of
the
post
plea
procedures.
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
it
correct
that
that
issue
has
to
be
reached
by
this
court
when
we
write
the
case?
the
issue
is
the
validity
of
the
plea
and
whether
a
jury
was
waived
as
to
the
forfeiture
determination,
that's
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
those
are
the
questions
as
i
read
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
or
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
the
judge
takes
appropriate
action
to
determine
forfeitability
after
the
entry
of
the
plea,
that
the
plea
is
valid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
and
that's
the
first
question.
now,
what
about
the
waiver
of
the
right
of
a
jury
to
determine
forfeitability?
does
the
entry
of
a
guilty
plea
waive
the
right
of
a
jury
to
determine
forfeitability
at
the
sentencing
stage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
mr.
stewart--
--i'm
actually
surprised
at
that.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
are
many
issues
of
forfeitability
that
are
somewhat
difficult...
the
tracing
of
assets
and
so
forth...
that
are
going
to
take
a
subsequent
hearing
after
the
plea's
entered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
know
the
cases
better
than
i
do,
but
i'm
surprised
at
your
answer.
