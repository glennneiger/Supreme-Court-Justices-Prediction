mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
to
the
applicability
of
rule
11(f),
i
think
the
questions
asked
by
justice
scalia
and
justice
breyer
really
pinpoint
the
weakness
of
petitioner's
argument.
that
is,
rule
11,
by
its
terms,
applies
only
to
pleas
of
guilty,
and
it
requires
the
district
court
to
find
only
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
as
this
court
recognized
in
mccarthy
v.
united
states,
a
plea
of
guilty
is
an
admission
that
the
defendant
committed
the
acts
charged,
and
a
willingness
to
forego
trial
on
those
charges.
a
concession
that
a
particular--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
i
mean,
that
would
not
be
as
a
result
of
rule
11(f),
but
we
agree--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--he
couldn't
do
it.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
if
the
defendant
was
pleading
guilty
to
a
crime
for
which
forfeiture
was
not
an
available
penalty--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
everybody
agrees
to
that,
then
the
sentence
would
be
an
illegal
one.
the
way
we
would
interpret--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
typically
the
responsibility
of
the
judge
would
be
to
determine
in
one
way
or
the
other
that
he
was
satisfied
that
the
sentence
was
a
lawful
one
under
the
applicable
statute,
and
we're
not
saying--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
the
defendant
has
conceded
that
the
property
is
forfeitable,
and
if
there
is
no
record
evidence
that
casts
doubt
upon
that
proposition,
and
if
that
agreement
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
i
think
the...
and
in
this
case
the
defendant
in
essence
conceded
that
all
his
assets
met
the
statutory
requirements
for
forfeiture.
now,
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
judge
would
have
to,
again
to
satisfy
himself
that
this
was
a
lawful
sentence,
and
if
the
judge--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
he
would
have
to
satisfy
himself
that
there
were
facts
supporting
it,
but
one
of
the
bits
of
evidence
he
could
look
to,
and
i
think
one
of
the
primary
pieces
of
evidence,
would
be
the
parties'
agreement--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
it
was
so,
and
i
think
one
highly
relevant
portion
of
the
colloquy
at
the
sentencing
hearing--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--he
has
to
find...
he
has
to
be
satisfied
that
the
property
is
forfeitable
under
the
statute,
and
typically
one
of
the
ways
that
judges
resolve
potential
factual
disputes
is
by
agreement
or
stipulation
of
the
parties.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
is
corr...
he--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
think
in
mccarthy
v.
united--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--both,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
let
me
explain--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i'm
suggesting
in
the
context
of
guilty
pleas
under
rule
11(f)
that
in
essence
the
plea
of
guilty
cannot
form
its
own
factual
basis.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
i
believe
the
stipulation
would
ordinarily
be
construed
as--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
is
correct,
and
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
and
ord--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
courts
have
recognized
through
the
years
that
the
judge
has
an
independent
obligation
to
impose
a
sentence
that
is
authorized
by
law
and
indeed,
the
plea
agreement
in
this
case
contained
a
term
stating
that
the
judge
was
not
bound
by
the
parties'
agreement
but
would
impose
the
sentence
that
he
deemed--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
believe
so,
and
let
me
explain
by
reference
to
mccarthy
v.
united
states.
in
mccarthy
v.
united
states,
the
government
made,
with
respect
to
guilty
pleas,
something
very
similar
to
the
argument
that
i'm
making
with
regard
to
sentencing
stipulations.
that
is,
the
government
argued
the
mere
fact
that
mccarthy
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
us
to
conclude
that
he
must
have
committed
the
crime,
and
the
court
said,
that's
not
good
enough,
and
it
pointed
to
rule...
what
at
that
time
was
rule
11,
it
hadn't
been
recodified
as
rule
11(f),
and
said
the
rule
specifically
requires
in
the
context
of
guilty
pleas
that
the
judge
look
beyond
the
party's
plea,
and
the
court
stated
that
the
reasons
for
this
requirement
are
specific
to
the
context
of
guilty
pleas.
that
is
precisely
because
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
criminal
offense
has
such
severe
consequences,
because
a
criminal
conviction
is
thought
to
be
such
a
significant
step,
the
court
has
an
obligation
with
respect
to
pleas
of
guilty
that
is
not
imposed
with
respect
to
concessions
or
stipulations
generally.
the
court
did
not
say
in
mccarthy,
in
the
area
of
criminal
law
generally
there
is
an
obligation
for
the
court
to
look
beyond
the
parties'
agreement
to
see
whether
they
are
accurate.
the
court
said,
guilty
pleas
are
different.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
plea
agreement
contained
only
a
term
stating
that
the
defendant
agrees
to
transfer
title
to
all
his
assets.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
strongest
indication
that
this
was
the
interpretation
the
parties
placed
upon
the
agreement
is
on
page
149
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
the
colloquy
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
and
petitioner's
counsel...
petitioner's
then-counsel
is
addressing
the
court,
and
counsel
states...
the
second,
the
first
full
paragraph,
second
paragraph...
your
honor,
of
course--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--page
149
of
the
joint
appendix.
counsel
states,
your
honor,
of
course
that's
all
for
naught,
because
as
a
result
of
this,
meaning
the
crime,
the
forfeiture
is
going
to
take
regular
money
and
illegal
money
under
the
substitute
assets.
maybe
all
those
years
that
he's
worked,
maybe
that
which
he's
loved
most
dearly
next
to
his
family,
those
dollars
for
whatever
reason
are
going
to
be
taken
from
him
by
the
government.
mr.
libretti
has
a
lot
of
questions
about
that.
it's
a
harsh
law.
both
the
cce
law
and
the
forfeiture
law
is
a
harsh
law.
it's
a
bitter
pill
dealt
by
congress,
but
it's
a
pill
we
must
swallow.
and
i
think
implicit
in
this
discussion
is,
first,
counsel's
recognition
that
all
of
the
property
was
to
be
forfeited
pursuant
to
the
agreement,
and
that
there
was
to
be
no
further
hearing
to
determine
which
property
would
be
forfeited
and
which
would
not,
but
i
think
second,
and
equally
significant--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--he
says--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--he
says,
regular
money
and
illegal
money
under
the
substitute
assets.
the
substitute--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
he
says
both
the
cce
law
and
the
forfeiture
law
is
a
harsh
law.
it's
a
bitter--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--pill
dealt
by
congress.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
at
the
hearing
itself
the
government
made
a
motion
for
forfeiture
that
listed
all
the
assets
that
were
subsequently
encompassed
in
the
district
court's
order
forfeiture,
and
defense
counsel
made
no
objection
to
that
motion,
and
this
is
the
portion
of
the
colloquy
that
most
directly
addresses
the
issue
of
forfeiture,
and
it
seems
to
us
not
to
be
an
acknowledgement
not
simply
that
all
of
the
property
would
be
forfeited
pursuant
to
the
agreement--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--exactly.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
you
look
at
page
324
of
the
court
of
appeals,
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
the
fifth
line
from
the
bottom,
the
court
of
appeals
states,
he
intended
to
forfeit
all
of
his
property
without
requiring
the
government
to
prove
the
assets
were
forfeitable.
the
plea
agreement
requires
forfeiture
pursuant
to
section
853,
which
includes
forfeitable
assets
under
853(a)
and
substitute
assets
under
section
853(p).
we
would
certainly
agree
that
if
the
plea
agreement
had
been
drafted
more
artfully
some
of
these
questions
would
have
disappeared.
we
think
on
the
whole
the
courts
below
and
petitioner's
then
trial
counsel
placed
the
construction
on
the
agreement
that
we
place
here.
in
any
event,
it's
certainly
irrelevant
to
the
11(f)
question.
that
is,
the
concession
either
is
or
is
not
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
if
the
agreement
were
clear
on
its
face
that
the
other
half
of
the
assets
were
not
forfeitable
under
the
statute
but
the
parties
were
nevertheless
agreeing
to
forfeit
them,
i
think
the
district
court's
obligation
would
be
to
reject
that
aspect
of
the
agreement--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--just
as
if
the
government
and
the
defendant
had
agreed
that
the
defendant
would
consent
to
a
prison
sentence
in
excess
of
that
authorized
by
law.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
probably
the
obligation
of...
probably
the
better
practice
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
would
be
to
inquire
as
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
i
think
what
went
on
at
the
sentencing
colloquy
was
what
ought
to
have
happened.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that
the...
precisely
because
the
parties
cannot
stipulate
to
an
illegal
sentence,
the
judge
could
construe
that
as
a
concession
that
all
of
the
property
was
forfeitable.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
he
would
not.
again,
if
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
we're
saying
to
impose
the
sentence
of
forfeiture.
not
for
the
plea
to
be
valid,
but
to
order
forfeiture
in
accordance
with
the
agreement,
the
judge
would
have
to
feel--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
but
for--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
but
pursuant
to
the
agreement,
if
the
parties...
if
the
defendant
had
stipulated
that
all
the
assets
were
forfeitable,
the
judge
would
be
perfectly
justified
in...
and
that
agreement
was
plausible
on
its
face--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
judge
would
be
justified
in
ordering
forfeiture
on
that
basis
alone
without
conducting
additional
proceedings,
and
certainly
the
point,
from
the
government's
perspective
of
entering
into
this
agreement,
was
precisely
to
obviate
the
need
for
an
elaborate
hearing
on
the
question
of
forfeitability.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
oh,
i
think
the
government's
view
would
be
that,
again,
leaving
aside
for
the
question...
for
the
moment
the
question
of
interpretation
of
the
agreement,
if
it
were
clear
that
the
agreement
was
a
concession
that
certain
assets
were
forfeitable
under
the
statute,
i
think
the
ordinary
principles
governing--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
correct
form
of
words
for
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
as
a
general
matter
the
district
court's...
the
district
court
could
enter
an
order
of
forfeiture
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
if
the
agreement
was
plausible
on
its
face,
and
if
it
were
not
squarely
contradicted
by
other
record
evidence.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
at
least
as
between
the
things
are
mentioned,
some
are
purely
factual
determinations,
some
are
purely
legal
determinations,
and
some
are
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law.
the
court
would
more
often
feel
justified
in
saying
that
a
stipulation
as
to
a
pure
question
of
law
was
implausible.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
certainly--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--certainly
it
isn't
necessary
to
resolve
this
question
to
decide
whether
rule
11(f)
imposes
upon
the
district
court
an
obligation
to
find
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
oh,
that's
correct,
and
in
general--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
is
somewhat
unclear.
as
a
practical
matter,
this
is
a
situation
that
virtually
never
arises.
that
is,
the
government
hardly
ever
enters,
or
virtually
never
enters
into
plea
agreements
in
which
issues
of
forfeitability
remain
unresolved
because
part
of
the
point
of
a
plea
agreement
from
our
standpoint
is
to
obviate
the
need
for
that
kind
of
prolonged
evidentiary
proceeding.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
typically--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--as
far
as
department
of
justice
practice
goes,
typically
if
we
were
going
to
enter
in...
you're
right
that
often
when
a
case
is
tried
to
a
jury
there
will
be
elaborate,
difficult
issues
of
forfeitability
remaining,
but
when
the
government
enters
into
a
plea
agreement,
typically
there
is
an
insistence
upon
obtaining
stipulations
or
concessions
as
to
forfeiture
as
well
so
that
we
don't
essentially
have
to
try
the
case
despite
the
entry
of
the
plea
agreement.
now,
it's
very
clear
that
the
defendant
could
simply
plead
guilty
without
an
agreement
and
preserve
his
right
to
contest
the
forfeitability
of
assets.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
agree,
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
knowing
relinquishment
standard
of
johnson
v.
zerbst
would
apply.
that
is,
by
pleading
guilty,
the
defendant
obviously
gave
up
a
host
of
rights
that
he
could
have
asserted
at
a
trial
had
he
insisted--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--he's
told
about
a
small
set
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
he's
not
required
under
rule
11
to
be
told
about
any
statutory
rights,
and
we
believe
that
rule
31(e)
is
not
a
constitutional
dimension.
moreover,
he
was
told
at
the
plea
colloquy
that
he
had
the
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury.
i
think
part...
in
a
sense,
petitioner's
argument
presumes
that
on
the
one
hand
the
right
to
a
jury
determination
on
forfeiture
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
jury
trial,
but
that
on
the
other
hand
for
purposes
of
the
rule
11
colloquy
they
are
two
different
things,
so
the
advice
that
you
have
the
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
doesn't
encompass
the
right...
the
advice
that
you
have
the
right
to
be
tried
to
a
jury
on
forfeiture.
in
general,
the
rule
11
colloquy
would
not
involve
an
elaborate
parsing
out
of
the
functions
that
judge
and
jury
would
play
at
trial,
so
even
if
a
defendant
received
a
perfectly
adequate
rule
11
colloquy,
he
might
still
be
uncertain
as
to
whether
particular
issues
would
have
been
resolved
by
the
judge
or
by
the
jury.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
we
know
that
he
was
not
told
by
the
court.
we
don't
know
whether
he
was
told
by
his
counsel,
but
he
could
waive
it
regardless
of
whether
he
had
actual
knowledge,
and
the
court
has--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
in--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
court
has
recognized
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
that
as
a
general
matter
a
defendant's
rights,
even
constitutional
rights,
can
be
waived
simply
by
the
failure
to
assert
them
at
the
proper
time,
so
it
can
often
happen
during
the
course
of
a
criminal
trial--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
in
fashioning
rule
11
the
drafters
didn't
state
that
the
defendant
had
to
be
advised
of
all
the
constitutional
rights
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
my
answer
may
sound
as
though
it's
questioning
your
premise
that
this
falls
within
the
sixth
amendment,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
procedural
protections
available
at
a
criminal
trial
as
a
prerequisite
to
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
have
always
been
given
a
higher
status
than
procedural
protections
available
at
sentencing.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
we
would
say,
first
we
would
draw
that
distinction
because
we
think
that
the
drafters
of
rule
11
drew
that
distinction.
they
referred
to
the
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury,
they
placed
it
in
the
context
of
other
rights
that
were
clearly
going
to
be
asserted
at
a
trial
rather
than
at
a
sentencing
proceeding.
and
the
second
point
we
would
make
is,
again,
if
this
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
he
was
told,
you
have
the
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury,
and
he
waived
it.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
certainly
that
statement...
i
think
the
judge
was
primarily
focusing
on
the
right
to
jury
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence,
because
that's
the
thing
that's
generally
at
issue.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
probably
the
most
likely
inference,
and
our
position
has
never
been--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
in...
the
rule
11
really
encompasses
two
categories
of
information
that
have
to
be
conveyed
to
the
defendant.
one
is
information
about
what
will
happen
to
you
if
you
plead
guilty,
what's
the
minimum
and
maximum
sentence,
and
so
forth,
and
the
other
category
of
information
is,
what
rights
would
you
be
able
to
insist
on
if
you
didn't
plead
guilty
and
insisted
upon
a
trial,
and
the
idea
is
to
allow
the
defendant
in
some
rough
sense
to
compare
the
options
available
to
him.
i
think
one
thing
that's
noteworthy
about
the
second
category
of
information...
what
would
happen
to
you
if
you
insisted
upon
a
right
to
trial...
is
that
it
doesn't
include
any
information
about
sentencing.
that
is,
the
defendant
is
not
required
to
be
told,
this
would
be
your
minimum
and
maximum
sentence
if
you
insisted
upon
a
right
to
trial.
indeed,
in
brady
v.
united
states,
the
court
held
that
a
defendant's
guilty
plea
was
voluntary
even
though
he
reasonably
believed
that
he
would
be
subject
to
a
sentence
of
death
if
he
insisted
upon
trial
and
was
convicted.
it
turned
out
that
that
was
not
the
case,
that
that
statutory
capital
provision
was
invalid,
and
therefore
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
under
the
misapprehension
that
he
would
be
subject
to
a
capital
sentence
if
he
contested
the
charges,
so
the
rule
simply
doesn't
require
the
same
quantum
of
information
as
to
what
would
happen
if
you
contested
the
charges
as
it
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
third
party
claims
to
the
property,
but
that
the
district
court
did
not
retain
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
petition.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
and
the
court
of
appeals
essentially
treated
that
aspect
of
the
post
judgment
proceedings
as
a
nullity.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
was
a
presentence
report.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
presentence
report
contains
information
regarding
the
legitimate
income
that
petitioner
had
earned
over
the
years
which
would
be
relevant
in
determining
the
plausibility
of
the
government's
claim
that
assets
would
be
forfeitable
under
the
substitute
assets
provision.
the
presentence
report
also
notes
forfeiture
as
an
available
sanction
but
does
not
go
into--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--to
the
extent
that
the
presentence
report
discusses
petitioner's
legitimate--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
does
help.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
okay.
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
in
the
record.
the
presentence
report
included
information
both
about
legitimate
earnings
and
about
the
extent
of
petitioner's
unlawful
conduct,
both
of
which
would
have
been
relevant
in
determining
the
plausibility
of
the
concession
that
all
the
property
was
forfeitable
under
the
statute.
