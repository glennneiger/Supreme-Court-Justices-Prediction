justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
district
judge
had
told
libretti
how
it
would
play
out
if
he
stood
trial,
exactly
what
would
have
to
be
proved,
so
he
knew
all
that
when
he
entered
his
plea.
would
that
have
been
enough
to
satisfy
the
legal
requirements,
if
the
judge
had
told
him,
just
as
he
tells
him
with
respect
to
his
substantive
offense,
now,
if
you
stand
trial,
there
will
be
a
jury
trial
on
these
assets,
and
there
will
be
this
special
verdict,
told
him
exactly
what
would
happen
if
he
stood
trial,
and
he
says,
your
honor,
i
want
this
plea,
and
then
at
the
end
he
says
what
he
did
here,
i
want
proof
made
with
respect
to
these
assets--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
answer
to
my
question
is...
your
answer
is
no,
it
would
not
have
been
enough
to
tell
him
exactly
how
this
would
play
out
if
he
stood
trial.
he
would
still
have
a
right
to
insist
on
some
kind
of
a
showing
with
respect
to
each
piece
of
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
make
those
arguments,
then
you're
saying
not
only
that
what
i
put
to
you
initially
wouldn't
be
good
enough,
to
tell
the
defendant
exactly
how
it
would
play
out
if
he
didn't
enter
the
plea,
but
you
are
also
saying
that
what
this
district
judge
tried
to
do
at
the
end
was
also
not
enough.
that
is,
the
district
judge,
instead
of
saying,
government,
come
forth
and
show
us
something
as
to
each
piece
of
property
to
link
it
with
the
forfeiture
right,
instead,
this
district
judge
said,
defendant,
i'm
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
tell
me
which
pieces
of
property
in
this
collection
are
not
subject
to
forfeiture.
your
answer
would
have
to
be,
that
is
not
enough,
either.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
government
has
to
make
a
showing,
then
how
can
it
be
enough
for
the
district
judge
to
say,
here's
this
big
pot
of
everything
you
have.
you
show
me
which
of
these
items
should
be
taken
out.
it's
quite
different
than
putting
a
burden
on
the
government
to
show
that
each
and
every
asset
is
in
some
way
connected
with
the
criminal
activity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
the
government
came
forward
with
anything.
the
government's
position
was,
we
have
a
plea,
and
it's
good.
now,
i'm
just
trying
to
see
how
this
fits
in
with
the
elements
of
the
offense
itself.
the
government
has
to
make
some
kind
of
showing.
it's
the
government's
burden.
here,
this
district
judge
put
the
burden
quite
plainly
on
the
defendant
and
said,
you
show
me
which
of
those
pieces
of
property
should
be
taken
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i'm
asking
you
what
the
rule
11
requires.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
don't
you
tell
me
what
you
think
are
the
marching
orders
for
the
district
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
i
asked
ms.
beale,
that
this
defendant
was
not
told
by
the
district
judge
going
in
about
this
most
unusual
kind
of
a
jury
determination
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
if
he
didn't
plead
guilty.
that
is,
the
special
verdict
and
all
of
that.
doesn't
he,
to
waive
that
right
to
the
jury
determination
on
the
forfeiture,
at
least
have
to
know
about
this
extraordinary...
a
special
verdict
in
a
criminal
case
is
really
extraordinary
procedure,
isn't
it,
and
not
one
word
was
said
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
under
rule
11
he's
told
about
those
rights,
or
many
of
them.
he's
certainly
not
told
about
this
unusual
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
asking
you
anything
abstract.
i'm
asking
you
about,
this
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
a
jury
trial
right.
does
defendant
waive
that
even
though
he
has
no
notion
that
it
exists
because
nobody
told
him
about
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i...
the
notion
of
an
unknowing,
unconscious
waiver
is
disturbing.
i
can
see
you
say,
well,
he
doesn't...
he's
really
not
entitled
to
know
about
it,
so
it
doesn't
matter
that
he
wasn't
told.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
can
you
waive
something
that
you
don't
know
you
have
a
right
to?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
normally
you
don't
have
a
jury
trial
on
the
sentence,
so
what
i
don't
understand
is
that
here
is
a
hybrid,
as
ms.
beale
called
it.
it
has
to
be
charged.
you
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
with
a
special
verdict,
and
to
say
that
a
defendant...
a
judge
doesn't
even
have
the
obligation
to
tell
the
judge...
the
defendant
with
respect
to
this
forfeiture
in
the
absence
of
a
plea
agreement
there
would
be
a
jury
trial
right,
and
the
jury
would
have
to
make
special
findings
on
each
item
of
property--
