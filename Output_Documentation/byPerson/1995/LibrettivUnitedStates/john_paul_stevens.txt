justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
number
94-7427,
libretti
v.
united
states.
ms.
beale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
beale,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
relief
that's
prompted
by
justice
kennedy's
question
and
your
answer
that
if
there
are
two
counts,
there
was
no
factual
basis
for
one,
a
guilty
plea
might
stand
as
to
one
count,
i
guess?
is
it
your
view
that
if
there's
no
factual
basis
for
the
forfeiture
but
there
is
an
adequate
factual
basis
for
the
guilt
of
the
offense
charge,
that
the
guilty
plea
would
remain
in
effect
and
the
judgment
of
guilt
could
stand
even
though
the
forfeiture
is
improper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
first
in
general,
and
then
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
court
then
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction
on
the
guilty
plea
of
the
charge
and
reserve
for
further
hearings
what
to
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
then,
going
to
this
case,
what
could
be
done
in
this
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
we
should
agree
with
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
have
one
other
question,
then
i'll
be
covered
everything
i
had
at
the
back
of
my
mind.
what
if
the
agreement
were
totally
ambiguous,
and
i
think
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
the
way
you
do,
too,
saying
that
even
if
some
of
the
property
might
not
be
forfeitable,
nevertheless
we
construe
the
agreement
as
an
undertaking
to
forfeit
everything.
assume
it's
clear
that
that's
what
the
agreement
was
in
exchange
for
a
somewhat
lesser
sentence,
would
that
agreement
be
enforceable,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
some
of
the
property
that
he
agreed
to
forfeit,
the
government
would
have
no
valid
claim
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
beale,
i
think
you've
given
an
answer
that
differs
from
one
you
gave
me
earlier.
i
asked
you
what
the
right
result
was,
and
you
said
you
can
pro
tanto
sustain
the
plea
to
the
crime,
to
the
offense,
but
said
aside
only
that
portion
which
would
support
the
forfeiture
judgment.
now
you're
saying
you
go
back
to
the
status
quo
ante,
which
would
mean
withdrawal
of
the
plea,
entire
plea.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
we
find
a
factual
basis
for
the
offense,
but
no
factual
basis
for
the
forfeiture.
then
what
do
you
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
that
require...
i'm
still
trying
to
find
out,
do
you
go
back
to
status
quo
ante
and
set
aside
the
guilty
plea,
or
do
you
merely
modify
the
judgment
insofar
as
it
affects
forfeiture.
which
do
you
think
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
forget
what
you
said
before.
tell
me
what
you
think
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
still
don't
know
which
is
the
right...
which
are
you
saying
they
must
do,
set
aside
the
entire
plea,
or
just
the
part
that
relates
to
forfeiture?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
trying
to
find
out
from
you
what
you
think
the
district
court
must
do.
if
he
finds
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea
of
guilty
of
the
offense
but
not
for
any
forfeiture,
what
must
he
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
should
set
aside
the
entire
plea.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
stewart.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question
to
kind
of
narrow
the
issue?
supposing...
the
reason
for
it
is
so
that
the
court
should
not
enter
judgment
upon
the
plea
unless
there's
a
factual
basis.
supposing
the
maximum
sentence
authorized
by
statute
is
10
years,
and
there's
a
plea
agreement
that
will
accept
12
years,
could
he
enter
a
12-year
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
he
couldn't
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
secondly,
supposing
there
is
clear...
that
there's
no
factual
basis
for
a
forfeiture,
but
there's
an
agreement
by
the
defendant,
i'll
forfeit
$10
million
because
i'm
going
to
get
a
5-year
sentence,
but
there's
no
statutory
legal
basis
for
a
forfeiture,
could
that
agreement
be
enforced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
forfeiture
is
an
available
penalty,
but
the
facts
would
not
support
forfeiture,
and
everybody
agrees
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
that
is
shown
after
the
judgment
is
entered,
then
what
happens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
sufficient
satisfaction
to
say
that
i've
got
an
agreement
in
front
of
me
in
which
the
defendant
says,
i
agree
to
forfeit
x
dollars?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
he
have
to
concede
particular
assets
are
forfeitable,
or
just
that
a
certain
amount
of
money
is
forfeitable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
one
doesn't
read
the
agreement
that
way,
one
merely
reads
it
as
an
agreement
to
forfeit
everything
i
own,
which
one
could
read
it,
would
the
judge
be
permitted
to
enter
this
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he'd
have
to
satisfy
himself
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
he
has
to
find
in
the
agreement
a
factual
basis
for
concluding
the
assets
are
forfeitable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
paragraph
doesn't
say
all
his
property
is
covered
by
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
it
may
be
some
regular
money
and
some
illegal
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say
that
the
substitute
assets
would
eat
up
his
entire
estate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
still
not
the
same
as
saying
he
gets
100
percent
of
his
estate,
even
if
the
forfeitable
assets
plus
the
substitute
assets
don't
equal
the
total.
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
all
of
it
was
forfeitable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
read
it
that
way.
if
you
look
at
page
325
of
the
joint
appendix,
they
seemed
to
say,
in
exchange
for
forfeiting
all
of
his
property.
that
seems
to
include
forfeitable
as
well
as
nonforfeitable.
he
made
his
deal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
irrelevant...
what
if
the
agreement
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
half
of
his
assets
were
forfeitable
properly,
but
the
agreement
nevertheless
provided
for
forfeiture
of
all
of
his
assets,
so
there
was
a
clear,
factual
basis
for
saying
that
everything
covered
by
the
agreement
is
not
authorized
to
be
forfeited.
what
would
happen
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
stewart,
can
i
ask
you...
your
time
is
about
to
expire...
two
questions
about
this
particular
case?
am
i
correct
that
the
only
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
order
of
forfeiture,
not
the
plea
of
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
secondly,
is
it
your
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
the
post
plea
proceedings
on
forfeiture
that
the
district
judge
was
conducting
cannot
be
conducted
under
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
defendant
could
not
make
any
further
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay,
thank
you.
was
there
a
presentence
report?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
the
case
is
submitted.
