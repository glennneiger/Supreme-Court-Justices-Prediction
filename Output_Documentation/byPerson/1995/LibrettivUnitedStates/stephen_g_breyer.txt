justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
want
to
rely
on
6(f)?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
your
finger
on
a
problem
that
bothered
the
sentencing
commission
for
several
years
which
we
couldn't
resolve,
and
why
you
want
to
rely
on
(f)
i
don't
know,
because
the
language
doesn't
fit
it,
nor
does
the
fact
that
forfeiture
appears
in
the
u.s.
code
under
the
term
"sentencing",
nor
to
about
five
other
things,
including
i
never
heard
this
one
made,
but
that
doesn't
destroy
your
point.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
is
what
i
think
you're
actually
trying
to
argue,
and
you
don't
have
to
jump
to
the
constitution,
you're
trying
to
argue
that
the
sentencing
statutes
require,
before
a
judge
accepts
a
sentence...
and
that
would
apply
to
forfeiture
and
five
other
things,
but
you
don't
argue
it...
before
he
does
that,
that
he
establish
that
there
is
some
basis
for
the
statutory
requirements
or
guideline
requirements
for
that
sentencing
existing,
that
that's
what
you
want
to
say.
and
i
can
tell
you
exactly
why
the
sentencing
commission
danced
around
it,
which
i'm...
first
of
all,
if
you
say
that's
part
of
the
constitution,
if
it
is,
the
sentencing
practices
of
50
states
are
really
in
trouble,
including...
and
moreover,
if
you
say
it's
part
of
the
code,
what
normally
happens
in
many
sentences
will
no
longer
exist
in
the
entire
federal
system.
all
right,
so
i
want
to
know
what
to
do
here.
that
is,
the
argument
isn't
made
squarely.
it's
made
in
a
context
where
the
language
and
five
other
things
are
against
it,
but
the
argument's
a
serious
one,
and
as
you
well
know,
in
the
guidelines,
chapter
6,
the
commission
dances
around
it
by
saying
that
the
judge
may,
after
deciding
that
the
facts
are
not
such,
decide
to
impose
the
true
sentence
irrespective
of
what
the
parties
agree,
but
it
doesn't
say
must.
now,
that's
what
i
would
like
you
to
address,
because
i
quite
honestly
don't
know
exactly
what
to
do
about
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
interested
particularly
in
your
reasons.
i'm
interested
in
what
you
think
we
should
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
not,
if
i
don't
think
the
language
or
anything
else
really
fits,
then
what?
we
just
say,
we'll
decide
this
another
time,
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
rely
on
besides
the
test
of
11(f)?
i
mean,
what
other
sentencing
statute
leads
you
to
that
conclusion,
unless
it's
11--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
not
under
11(f),
and
if
you
do...
can
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
only
difference
i
can
see
is
if
you
choose
11(f)
and
you
win
this
case,
there
has
to
be
a
new
trial.
i
don't
see
how
you
avoid
the
fact
that
the
guilty
plea
is
void
and
your
client
goes
right
to
trial.
if,
however,
these
other
statutes
are
what
requires
it,
then
the
remedy
is
a
new
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this...
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
right
form
of
words
in
your
opinion?
where
we
are,
as
i
take
it,
is,
forget
about
11(f).
that
has
to
do
with
guilty
pleas.
we're
now
talking
about
justice
stevens'
question,
which
is
that
a
judge
is
never
free
to
impose
an
illegal
sentence,
and
here
we
have
a
forfeiture
statute,
we
also
have
a
statute
that
governs
in
very
great
detail
sentences
of
all
sorts
and
shapes,
and
one
of
the
major
questions
is
the
extent
to
which
parties
can
stipulate
to
facts
relevant
to
sentencing
which
aren't
true.
so
this
governs
quite
a
lot,
and
the
issue,
i
take
it,
is
what's
the
right
form
of
words
for
this
court
to
write
as
to
the
duty
imposed
on
a
federal
district
judge
to
determine
independently
what
the
facts
are
in
respect
to
a
fact
relevant
to
sentencing
to
which
the
parties
have
agreed?
now,
there
are
two
guideline
sections
written
on
this,
and
neither
answers
that
question,
so
what
is
the
government's
view,
because
i
don't
see
how
to
write
this
case
without
taking
a
view
on
that,
though
it
isn't
fully
argued.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right.
if
they
had
said
right
here,
as
your
directive,
i
guess,
of
november
1994
now
tells
everybody
to
say,
the
defendant
should
stipulate
as
to
what
the
facts
are,
that
if
that
were
clear,
there
wouldn't
be
a
problem.
you
could
just
say,
yes,
there's
enough
here.
or
alternatively,
if
there
were
nothing,
i
guess
it
wouldn't
be
a
problem.
we
could
say
there's
nothing
here.
what
is...
but
we
might
have
to
be
in
that
ambiguous
area
where
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
standard
as
to
what
there
has
to
be,
and
that's
why
i'm
asking
what
in
your
opinion...
and
i
think
it's
quite
difficult
to
answer,
but
we
may
have
to
answer
it.
what,
in
your
opinion,
is
the
correct
form
of
words
to
describe...
i'd
be
repeating
myself.
you've
taken
it
in,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
correct
form
of
words
to
describe
the
duty
of
a
sentencing
judge
in
the
federal
system
independently
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
a
fact
relevant
to
sentencing
is
true--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--given
that
there
is
a
stipulation.
maybe
there
is
no
independent
duty,
but
maybe
there
is
some.
maybe
you
have
to
look
at
the
presentence
report.
was
there
a
presentence
report
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
you
have
to
ask
some
questions.
i'm
asking
to
get
your
opinion
on
that,
if
there
is
one
that
you
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
also
would
hold
for
stipulations
as
to
how
much
drugs
there
were,
stipulations
as
to
the
proper
guideline
level,
stipulations
as
to
the
amount
of
the
fine,
stipulations
as
to...
you
know.
i
mean,
i
take
it
there's
no
way
to
differentiate
the
one
from
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
did
the
presentence
report
go
into
any
of
these
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
point
is,
is
there
anything
in
that
that
would
add
to
the
quantum
of
information
that
the
sentencing
judge
had
if
the
obligation
is
on
the
sentencing
judge
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
basis
for
the
forfeiture
that
he
ordered?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
help,
or
doesn't
it
help?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
have
it
here?
we
should
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
