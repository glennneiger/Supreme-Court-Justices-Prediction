but
at
a
certain
level
it
seems
to
me
that
the
expression
necessarily
merges
with
the
function
certainly
at
a
very
simple
level,
start/stop
to
make
the
machine
go.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
more
than
creativity,
sweat
of
the
brow.
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
that
you
say
is
protected.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
general
rule
that
you
apply
in
order
to
have
us
follow
that
and
make
that
analysis
and
come
out
in
your
case?
this
is
protected
because--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
the
creativity--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
order
to
refute
that
point,
do
the
respondents
have
to
rely
on
a
doctrine
or
the
idea
of
merger,
that
the
expression...
they
so,
oh,
no,
you're
wrong
because
the
function
has
merged
with
the
expression.
is
that
the
only
way
they
can
win?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
that
their
principal
refutation
of
your
argument?
let
me
put
it
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
question
is
why
is
this
expression
that
you
ask
for...
to
be
protected
by
the
copyright...
why
is
that
so
divorced
from
the
function?
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
different
than
the
text.
the
text
describing
how
lotus
works
everybody
says
is
copyrightable.
the
command
menus
are
not
according
to
the
first
circuit.
and
the
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
command
menus,
it
does
merge
very
closely
with
the
function.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the
legal
labels
we've
used
to
express
this?
are
you
talking
about
the
doctrine
of
merger,
that
is
to
say
that
the
expression
merges
into
the
function?
or
are
you
saying
that
we
can
decide
and
should
decide
this
case
by
saying
that
there
is
a
definitional
distinction
between
expression
on
the
one
hand
and
method
of
operation
on
the
other?
i
take
it
you
could
prevail
under
either
approach.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
just
say
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
argument
you've
just
made,
which
was
a
sensible
one,
is
reflected
in
either
of
the
two
categories
that
i
mentioned.
if
you
just
wanted
to
say,
oh,
well,
this
is
very
important
for
people
to
have,
i
suppose
we
could
make
that
functional
sort
of
judgment
that
this
shouldn't
be
protected.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
require
us
to
use
different
kinds
of
labels.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
need
to
know
what
kind
of
labels
i'm
supposed
to
use
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
reach
that
result.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
why
you
concede...
i
think
you
concede...
that
the
program
code
that
lotus
wrote,
the
code
that
enables
the
machine
to
react
to
the
human
commands,
is
copyrightable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
am
i
correct
that
you
conceded
that
that's
copyrightable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
a
little
odd
that
the
closer
you
get
to
the
machine,
the
more
expression
there
is,
but
when
you
back
up,
then
you
tell
me
i
have
to
have
a
patent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
the
closer
to
the
human
you
come,
the
more...
the
stronger
the
case
is
for
expression.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
argument
doesn't
work
quite
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
what
you're
suggesting
is
the
standard
is
do
not
give
a
copyright
that's
unfair?
