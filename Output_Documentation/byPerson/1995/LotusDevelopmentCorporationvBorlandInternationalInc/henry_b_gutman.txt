mr.
henry
b.
gutman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
copyright
infringement
case.
it
was
brought
and
tried
under
that
statute
and
none
other.
it
is
our
position
and
the
issue
before
the
court
that
the
first
circuit
committed
error
here
when
it
held
that
section
102(b)
of
the
copyright
act
precludes,
as
a
matter
of
law,
protecting
the
separable
original
expression
contained
in
the
menus
of
lotus
1-2-3.
this
holding
was
not
based
upon
the
finding
of
fact
that
there
was
any
merger
in
this
instance
of
the
expression
in
those
menus
with
any
idea
or
process
or
method.
judge
keeton
in
the
district
court
made
fact
findings
exactly
to
the
contrary
after
trial
and
the
first
circuit
said...
and
this
is
in
the
petition
appendix
at
21a...
that
it
was
accepting
that
fact
finding
as
correct.
and
clearly
there's
no
finding
that
any
of
it
was
clearly
erroneous,
so
there's
no
first
circuit--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--protectable
expression
and
a
lack
of
merger,
your
honor,
and
originality.
frankly,
judge
keeton
conducted
the
trial
on
all
of
the
elements
under
102(a)
as
set
out
in
feist,
and
on
each
of
those
grounds,
our
menus
passed
muster.
the
judge...
the
first
circuit
did
not
reject
any
of
that
fact
finding
as
clearly
erroneous.
rather,
the
first
circuit
reached
its
conclusion
by
failing
to
apply
or
by
applying
incorrectly
the
idea/expression
dichotomy.
this
error
is
alone
sufficient
ground
for
a
reversal
on
remand,
without
reaching
any
of
the
other
issues
that
have
been
briefed
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
but
what
it
didn't...
i'm
sorry.
i
believe
the
chief
justice
meant
copyrightable
i
think.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
i
was
here.
i
remember.
[laughter]
i
remember,
and
i
do
want
that
distinction
to
be
clear
in
our
argument
today.
but
that
is
a
point
of
contention
between
the
parties.
what
they
found
was
that
because
it
provides
the
means...
these
menus
provide
the
means
by
which
users
control
and
operate
lotus
1-2-3,
it
is
therefore
part
of
a
method
of
operation.
the
error...
the
error...
was
that
the
first
circuit
made
no
effort
to
determine
whether
there
was
expression
that
could
be
distinguished
or
separated
from
the
method
of
operation.
that's
the
fundamental
error
here.
this
court
taught
in
feist
that
the
idea/expression
dichotomy
applies
in
every
case
and
that
it
is
not
an
option.
one
does
not
just
define.
one
looks
at
the
work
and
attempts
to
determine
whether
there
is
expression
that
can
be
separated
from
the
idea.
this
is
the
crux
of
the
interaction
between
sections
102(a)
and
102(b)
of
the
statute.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
respectfully,
i
would
disagree,
justice
souter.
it's...
it
is
an
analysis
case.
copyright
rarely
provides
black
and
white
answers
or
bright
lines.
the
issue
in
each
of
these
cases...
and
this
is
the
heart
of
the
idea/expression
dichotomy...
is
to
look
at
the
works
and
determine
whether
the
portions
that
are
at
issue
are
portions
that
cannot
be...
to
which
the
protection
may
not
extend,
in
the
words
of
102(b),
because
they
are
a
system,
a
method,
et
cetera.
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
instance
is
words,
whose
only
function
and
purpose
is
to
inform
the
user
as
to
what
functionality
is
available
in
the
program
and
how
to
access
it,
that
is,
which
keystrokes
to
use
in
order
to
get
the
program
to
do--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--this
was
the
subject
of
the
trial
in
the
district
court,
your
honor,
and
judge
keeton
was
mindful
of
the
court's
decision
in
feist.
we
have
an
extensive
trial
record,
and
it
was
the
creative
choices,
unlike
feist
where
one
took
a
given
set
of
names
and
simply
alphabetized
them
which
did
not
have
that
minimum
spark
of
creativity
that
the
copyright
act
requires.
in
this
instance,
the
creators
of
lotus
1-2-3
beyond
having
made
the
decisions
as
to
what
functions
the
program
should
perform,
all
of
which
judge
keeton
clearly
provided
was
not
protected.
the
functionality,
he
said,
was
part
of
the
unprotected
idea,
and
we
did
not
seek
to
get
him
to
rule
otherwise
on
that
subject.
the
functions
the
program
performs
are
not
protected.
even
taking
that
as
a
given,
what
judge
keeton
found
was
that
the
creators
of
1-2-3
had
a
vast
array
of
choices
in
terms
of
how
they
would
present
that
functionality
to
the
user
and
that's
where
the
expression
is.
the
expression
is
in
deciding
what
words...
just
deciding
whether
to
have
menus
or
not,
deciding
what
words
to
use
in
the
menus,
deciding
what--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--there's
no
question,
justice
kennedy,
that
there
are
certain
menus
and
certain
user
interfaces
that
would
be
far
too
simple
to
pass
the
feist
test.
we
are
not
taking
the
position,
never
have,
did
not
in
the
court
below,
in
the
first
circuit
did
not--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--well,
if
i
may
use
the
inelegant
analogy
of
sweat,
i
believe
that
what
the
feist
case
established
is
that
not
all
sweat
has
equal
impact
under
copyright
law.
sheer
sweat
of
the
brow
doesn't
make
it.
that's
clear
after
feist.
but
intellectual
creative
sweat,
expressive
sweat,
spending
months,
as
the
authors
of
1-2-3
did,
considering
dozens
and
dozens
and
dozens
of
different
iterations
of
a
menu
structure
and
of
precise
words
to
use
and
their
placement
to
find
what
you
think
is
the
best-way
of
presenting
it
is
precisely
the
kind
of
creative
activity
which
i
think
does
pass
muster
under
feist.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
because--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--because
it
is--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--i'm
sorry.
because
it
is
original
within
the
meaning
of
feist.
it's
the
work
of
the
author,
and
it
shows
that
minimal
spark
of
creativity
quite
easily,
well
beyond.
this
is
not
a
close
case
under
feist.
two,
because
there
is
not
a
merger
of
the
idea
or
functions
of
the
program
and
the
expression
in
these
particular
menus.
now,
the
way
judge
keeton
made
that
judgment
was
based
on
a
factual
record
before
him
which
included
dozens
of
different
spreadsheet
programs,
all
of
which
provided
fundamentally
the
same
functionality,
but
which
had
very
different
menus.
indeed,
the
single...
if
one
had
to
rely
on
only
a
single
bit
of
evidence
to
refute
merger
here,
i
would
rely
on
the
infringing
work
itself,
borland's
program
quattro
pro,
because
it
provided
in
the
same
package,
in
the
same
program
two
separate
sets
of
menus,
ours
and
theirs,
to
access
precisely
the
same
functionality.
so,
they--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
user
and
borland
stand
in
very
different
positions
for
fair
use
purposes.
what
the
user
does
in
terms...
for
example,
if
a
user
wanted
to
convert
a
1-2-3
macro
so
that
it
would
work
in
quattro
pro
and
the
conversion
was
required,
there
is
much
that
that
user
could
do
for
his
or
her
own
personal
purposes
that
i
think
would
fairly
easily
qualify
as
a
fair
use.
when
a
competitor
makes
a
wholesale
appropriation
of
your
entire
menu
structure,
which
is
the
communicative
core
of
the
user
interface
of
the
program--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--well,
that
brings
me...
the
user
can
rewrite
the
macro
or
convert
it
as
necessary
even
if
borland
had
done
none
of
what
it
did
in
infringement.
but
that
does
bring
me
naturally
to
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make,
which
is
because
the
first
circuit
dealt
the
way
it
did
with
copyrightability,
it
never
reached
the
next
step
which
is
infringement.
and
there
were
two
separate
active
infringements
here
on
the
part
of
borland.
one
was
copying
the
words
on
the
screen,
the
menus
themselves.
the
second,
which
was
a
mid-litigation
development
and
the
subject
of
our
supplemental
complaint,
was
this
macro
key
reader,
which
was
an
internal
translator.
now,
there
may
very
well
be
different
issues.
there
are
different
issues
in
terms
of
infringement
between
those
two
different
acts
of
infringement,
and
the
first
circuit
never
reached
any
of
those.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
or
to
fix
them.
and
if...
what
that
point
makes,
which
was
made
by
a
number
of
the
amici,
your
honor...
what
that
illustrates
is
exactly
our
point,
that
the
purpose
of
the
menus
is
to
inform.
the
only
reason
they
would
want
the
words...
if
someone...
let
me
back
up
a
step.
if
someone
wanted,
having
already
purchased
quattro
pro
and
being
a
quattro
pro
user
now,
not
only
to
convert
a
1-2-3
macro
so
that
it
could
be
used
in
quattro
pro,
but
to
keep
writing
it
as
a
1-2-3
macro,
which
wouldn't
make
sense
once
you've
switched...
even
if
someone
wanted
to
do
that,
what
the
argument
of
the
amici
is
is
that,
well,
you'd
still
need
to
look
at
those
words
of
the
menu
in
order
to
understand
what
you
were
doing.
and
the
response
to
that
is,
if
so,
it
is
only
because
the
function
of
those
words
is
to
inform.
you
could
get
the
same
information
out
of
a
piece
of
paper
or
a
1-2-3
users
manual
which,
as
a
former
1-2-3
user,
you
presumably
have.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
that's
exactly
the
point.
that's
exactly
the
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
infringement
issue,
which
is
where
these
two
different
points
come
up
is
not
before
the
court
and
wasn't
addressed
by
the
first
circuit.
so,
my
point
is
if
i
am
correct,
if
our
position
is
correct,
that
the
first
circuit
made
a...
an
error
in
interpreting
102(a)
and
its
relationship
to
102(b)
and
there's
a
reversal
on
remand,
the
first
circuit
can
then
deal
with
the
infringement
issues,
at
which
point
it
may
or
may
not
decide
that
the
key
reader
is
different
from
the
menus.
i
mean,
we
understand
and
recognize
that
the
protection
on
the
key
reader,
that
the
issues
are
different
and
that
the
arguments
are
not
as
strong
there
because
the
expressive
content
is
not
as
strong.
but
that
is
not
an
issue
that
this
court
has
before
it
because,
as
the
chief
justice
just
pointed
out,
the
issue
raised
in
the
petition
and
the
only
issue
dealt
with
by
the
first
circuit,
and
thus
before
the
court,
is
the
issue
of
copyrightability
and
this
fundamental
issue
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
pieces
of
102.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
well--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--well--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--certainly.
i
would
not
agree
that
the
words
are
the
system,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
i
understand
the
point
of
the
question
but
in
this
case
it's
not
correct.
that
is,
borland's
own
product...
again,
this
is...
borland's
own
product
is
a
refutation
of
the
point
because
they
did
present
exactly
that
same
organization
of
functions,
which
your
honor
referred
to
as
the
system.
yet,
their
commands
for
accessing
exactly
the
same
functions
are
quite
different.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
borland
provided
exactly...
exactly...
the
same
functions.
it's
a
single
program.
the
computational
engine
on
the
inside
is
one
engine,
and
there
are
two
separate
menus,
two
separate
sets
of
menus--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--by...
well,
the
answer,
your
honor,
would
be
that
they
would
do
it
the
way
everybody
else
who
produced
a
competing
spreadsheet
tried
to
do
it.
some
of
them
succeeded,
some
of
them
failed.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
no.
i
understand
the
worry,
your
honor,
and
where
we
have
a
different
perspective
is
that
we
don't
believe
we
are
trying
to
protect
the
system.
we
are
protecting
a
particular
set
of
words
which
could
have
been
widely
varied
without
changing
the
system,
the
idea,
what
judge
keeton
called
the
idea,
what
we're
referring
to
as
the
set
of
functionality.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
defenses
available
under
the
copyright
law.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
their...
no.
their
principal
refutation
before
this
court
is
to
argue
that
this
really
isn't
a
question
of
copyright
law.
it's
a
question
of
patent
law,
which
is
a
separate
issue.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
well,
the
difference,
your
honor,
is...
the
only
difference
between
the
longer
texts
that
are
acknowledged
to
be
protected--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--is
conciseness,
and
there
is
nothing
in
copyright
law
that
says
a
very
concise
index
or
table
of
contents
of
a
work
is
not
protected
from
being
copied
by
someone
who
likes
it.
you
can't
copy
the
index
of
the
samuelson
economics
text
because
you
think
that's
a
good
way
to
teach
economics
and
you'd
like
to
make
it
the
model
for
your
own
independently
written
beyond
that
point
economics
text.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
it's
a
sliding
scale,
your
honor.
the
degree
of
freedom
of
expression
that
is
available...
and
i
would
remind
the
court
that
when
we
look
at
these
questions...
these
are
copyrightability
questions...
we're
looking
not
at
the
work
of
the
infringer.
the
question
isn't
what
freedom
did
borland
have
when
it
wrote.
the
question
is
what
freedom
did
lotus
have
when
the
authors
of
1-2-3
sat
down
to
write.
that's
where
one
focuses.
and
if
that
freedom
of
expression
available
to
the
creator,
the
author
is
narrowly
limited,
then
the
right
in
copyright
is
narrowly
limited.
it's
thin.
for
example,
a
factual
work,
a
compilation.
there
perhaps
all
you
have
is
your
own
organization
and--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--exactly
right,
your
honor.
if
these
words
and
menus
were
printed
in
a
little
pamphlet,
a
little
pocket
guide
to
1-2-3,
a
reminder
on
a
printed
page,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
they'd
be
protected.
i
don't
think
anybody
would...
we
wouldn't
be
here.
the
fact
that
they
are--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--well,
the
question...
languages
is
a
tricky
question
because
if
one--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--the
program
is
certainly
copyrightable,
your
honor.
we
are
not
claiming
protection
of
the
language.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
well,
this
is
more
like
a
users
manual,
your
honor.
this
is
a
users
manual.
it's
a
short,
concise
users
manual
for
the
program,
and
copyright
has
always
protected--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--well,
there
is
a
distinction
between...
in
languages.
again,
this
court
has
not
decided...
and
there
are
some
suggestions
from
learned
hand
in
an
old
decision...
that
a
language,
not
english
or
french,
not
some
natural
language,
but
that
an
invented
language
could
be
protected
by
copyright.
fortunately,
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
to
decide
that--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--again,
there--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--people
protect
the
compilers,
and
if
one
wanted
to
draw
that
analogy,
our
program,
our
menus
are
more
like
the
compiler
than
they
are
like
a
language.
now,
that's
not
an
issue
that
was
dealt
with
by
either
of
the
courts
below.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
it,
and
language
could
itself...
what
is
a
language?
what
is
a
computer
language
is
itself
a
subject
that
could
consume
much
time
and
debate
and
much
expert
testimony,
none
of
which
is
in
this
case.
we're
not
claiming--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--i
just
wanted
to
make
it
clear
we
aren't
claiming
it's
protected.
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
it's
not,
your
honor,
because
contu
also
talked,
for
example,
about
databases
which
are
texts
that
shows
up
on
the
screen
of
a
computer.
so,
contu
never
said
only
the
code
of
a
program
is
what
would
be
protected.
and,
again,
the
contu
report
has--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--yes.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
that...
i
was
about
to
say
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
prefer,
rather
than--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
as
legislative
history
goes,
it
is
of
the
light
variety.
it
ranks
below
house
reports
and
senate
reports
and
in
all
instances
below
the
words
of
the
statute
which
says,
copyright
protection
subsists
in
original
works
of
authorship
fixed
in
any
tangible
medium
of
expression,
now
known
or
later
developed,
from
which
they
can
be
perceived,
reproduced,
or
otherwise
communicated
either
directly
or
with
the
aid
of
a
machine
or
device.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
no,
your
honor.
it's
a
literary
work.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
it's...
it
is
still
a
literary
work,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
that's
what
congress
said.
these
are
words.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
it
fits
within
the
definition
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
of
a
literary
work.
it
also
fits
within
102(a)'s
express
terms,
and
on
that
basis
we
think
it's...
it
is
both
a
protectable
work
under
102(a)
and
a
literary
work,
which
is
also
what
congress
said
concerning
computer
programs.
i'd
like
to,
if
i
could,
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
thank
you.
mr.
reback
conceded
that
a
musical
score
or
a
choreography
would
be
protected
by
copyright
even
though
the
score
instructs
the
player
in
how
to
play
his
or
her
instrument,
even
though
the
choreography
instructs
the
dancer
in
where
to
move
his
or
her
feet
and
body,
and
even
though
they
can
be
memorized
like
the
keystrokes
of
lotus
1-2-3.
copyright
has
always
protected
instructive
materials.
there's
nothing
different
here.
it
is
also
not
an
argument
that
this
particular
work,
through
its
popularity,
has
become
too
important
to
protect.
this
court
in
a
more
important
context,
i
would
submit,
answered
that
question
definitively
in
harper
and
row.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
well,
it
explains...
in
this
case
it
explains
or
provides
a
means
for
someone
to
perform
the
work
of
art.
the
music
exists
even
if
there's
no
score.
even
if
no
one
wrote
it,
the
music
could
exist.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
but
that's
not
the
standard.
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
copyright
has
always
provided
protection
to
commercially
useful
works.
and,
again,
any...
all
of
these
issues
only
go
to
the
question
of
the
scope
of
protection,
and
here
judge
keeton
found
virtually
identical
copying
which
even
would
have
met
the
baker
v.
selden
necessary
incidents
test.
that
is
the
standard
in
baker
v.
selden.
the
final
point
i
wanted
to
touch
on
is
that
all
the
policy
arguments
about
compatibility
and
competition
do
not
address
and
do
not
take
into
account
the
corrective
power
of
the
market.
if
consumers
and
customers
want
open
systems
and
software
companies
don't
provide
it,
if
it's
a
competitive
market,
they
will
make
their
wishes
known
by
voting
with
their
feet.
some
would
say
borland
has
said
that
that's
what
happened
to
lotus.
in
instances
where
that's
not
sufficient,
congress
has
spoken.
the
copyright
act
has
many
detailed
provisions
providing
for
compulsory
licensing
in
instances
where
that
was
not
good
enough
and
the
ordinary
rules
didn't
apply.
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases.
i
would
end
with
what
i
think
was
the
thrust
of--
mr.
henry
b.
gutman
--i
just
did.
thank
you
very
much.
