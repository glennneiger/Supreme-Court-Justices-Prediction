and
that
fact
finding
found
some
protectable
expression
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
part
of
what
troubles
people
i
suppose
is
that
if
you
have
a
little
menu
command
and
all
it
says
is
exit,
block,
move,
et
cetera,
maybe
those
are
just
functional.
what
is
it
about
the
lotus
program
that
makes
it
protectable
expression
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
all
you
had
were
just
a
few
words
in
the
command
like
block,
move,
stop,
print,
perhaps
not
copyrightable,
but
what
did
we
have
here?
469
commands
and
50
menus
and
submenus
and
so
on
and
so
on.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course,
the...
even
if
some
portion
of
this
is
copyrightable,
as
the
district
court
would
have
found,
it
doesn't
take
it
out
of
public
use
in
the
sense
that
presumably
lotus
could
license
a
use
of
its
system
to
someone.
it
isn't
as
though
this
is
forever
unavailable
to
other
people.
it
just
merges
into
the
whole
economics
of
what
it's
worth
to
buy
the
right
to
use
it.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
find
that
a
little
difficult
to
swallow.
i
mean,
the
copyright
law
does
appear
at
least
to
permit
the
copyright
of
a
so-called
users
manual,
and
if
that
is
carried
out
in
the
form
of
a
menu
command
hierarchy,
why
isn't
that
protectable
under
the
broad
language
of
102(a)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
when
it's
in
the
form
of
a
menu
command
hierarchy,
why
isn't
it
also
in
light
of
the
broad
language
of
102(a)?
i
mean,
at
least
some
portion
of
it,
the
portion
that
is
clearly
original
and
expressive,
if
that
is
the
finding
of
the
trial
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
borland
just
made...
borland
made
a
wholesale
copying
of
a
very
complex
menu
command
hierarchy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
just
wholesale.
i
can't
imagine
a
case
that
would
present
the
question
more
starkly.
