but
isn't
the
difficulty
that
we
have
here
is
that
there
are
varying
sort
of
degrees
of
merger
and
utility?
at
one
extreme
is
the
computer
program
itself.
at
another
extreme,
not
in
this
case,
would
be
i
suppose
the
dashboard
of
the
model
t
ford.
here
we're
dealing
with
something
that
is
in
sort
of
a
median
range.
it
is
in
fact
used
in
the
most
utilitarian
of
fashions,
and
yet
theoretically
one
can
say,
yes,
it
is
expressive
and
that
there
is
some
degree
of...
certainly
of
non-merger.
and
isn't
the
problem
that
the
first
circuit
had
and
the
problem
that
we
had...
have
is
not
an
analytical
problem,
but
a
problem
of
saying
that
something
which
is
kind
of
in
the
middle
could
be
classified
one
way
or
the
other.
and
judge
boudin
answered
that
by
saying
you
ought
to
look
to
certain,
quite
practical
consequences.
isn't
that
the
way
we
should
look
at
it,
as
a
choice
case
rather
than
analysis
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
could
also
protect
a...
an
original
language
that
you
had
written
then
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
one
more
removed,
but
i
suppose
you
could
make
the
same
argument
that
that
was
indistinguishable
from
your
ultimate
program
which
is
copyrightable
that
you
can
make
with
respect
to
the
menu.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
why
couldn't
you?
why
isn't
that...
i
mean,
what
is
it
that
draws
the
line
at
such
a
claim?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
would
carry
you
right
to
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you're
saying
your
argument
is,
well,
you
can't
distinguish
in
practical
terms
between
the
program
and
the
users
manual.
well,
if
you
had
invented
a
language
and
the
only
way
to
get
to
the
menu
was
to
the
use
of
language,
you
could
make
the
same
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
an
entirely
different
kind
of
question,
and
it
goes
to
this
point
of
whether
it
is
indeed
possible
to
draw
the
line
that
the
first
circuit
drew
between
program
and
menu.
the
respondents
pointed
to
evidence
that
that
is
what
congress
intended
to
do,
and
they
did
this
at
page...
i
wrote
it
down...
page
37
of
their
brief
by
referring
to
the
contu
report
and
said
that
the
contu
report
apparently
expressly
referred
to
the
copyrightability
of
a
source
code,
an
object
code,
and
possibly
the
flow
chart,
and
that's
where
it
stopped
so
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
read
the
1980
amendments
as
expressing
congress'
judgment
that
this
material
would
be
copyrightable
and
that
anything
beyond
that
need
not
be.
is
that
a
fair
argument
and
an
accurate
argument...
an
accurate
statement
of
the
contu
report?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
didn't
say
that
it
is
only
what
would
be
protected,
but
it
expressly
said
that
it
would
be
protected.
justice
david
h.
souter
with
the
negative
pregnant
that
beyond
that
congress...
if
congress
in
fact
was
more
or
less
adopting
that
suggestion,
that
congress
did
not
positively
intend
to
go
any
further.
well,
congress
didn't
enact
the
contu
report,
did
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
preceded
the
legislation.
so,
do
you
feel
that
it
has
no
interpretive
significance?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
that
answer
their
question
that
it's
the
combinations
that
they
are
trying
to
seek?
it's
not
the
mere
words.
it's
the
menu
which
is
a
combination
of
words
in
hierarchical
order,
and
that...
your
answer
doesn't
seem
to
go
to
that
claim
of
theirs.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
the
freedom
of
words
from
copyright
doesn't
answer
their
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
word
file.
somebody
else
can
use
the
word
file.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
they
say
absolutely
right.
but
using
it
in
the
combination,
the
hierarchical
set
of
orders
that
we
have
devised,
that
is
subject
to
copyright.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you
can
use
the
words
without
using
our
menu.
that's
their
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
different
combinations,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
to
do
different
things
for
that
matter.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
technically
someone
could
have
come
up
with
a
different
set
of
column
headings
for
selden's
system
and
still
have
come
up
with
the
same
results.
so,
isn't
it
the
case
that
implicit
in
selden
is
some
kind
of
calculus
saying
it
would
be
too
socially
expensive
to
require
them
to
do
that?
and
isn't
that
the
same
calculus
that
judge
boudin
was
going
through,
and
isn't
that
why
this
is
not
merely
an
analytical
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
throws
up
the
stakes
considerably.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
can't
blame
you
for
that.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
if
the
other
side
wins,
there's
never
going
to
be,
in
effect,
a
new
program
because
there
will
never
be
a
practical
way
to
use
that
program.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
in
a
sentence
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
the
musical
score
do
two
things?
it
instructs
the
player,
but
it
also
defines
the
work
of
art
and
that
is
something
different
from
the
relationship
between
the
menu
command
and
the
program.
